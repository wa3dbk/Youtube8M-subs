Zealand are I'm just skeptical about
their<00:02:04.740> attacking<00:02:05.130> ability<00:02:05.790> but<00:02:06.750> in<00:02:07.049> the

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
their attacking ability but in the

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.990 
their attacking ability but in the
second<00:02:07.530> half<00:02:07.710> they'll<00:02:08.009> have<00:02:08.310> to<00:02:08.340> push<00:02:08.700> more

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
second half they'll have to push more

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.790 
second half they'll have to push more
and<00:02:09.300> they<00:02:09.660> will<00:02:09.869> be<00:02:09.899> spent<00:02:10.319> there<00:02:10.500> will<00:02:10.649> be

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
and they will be spent there will be

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.260 
and they will be spent there will be
spaces<00:02:11.250> for<00:02:11.430> Mexicans<00:02:12.000> and<00:02:12.180> I

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
spaces for Mexicans and I

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:15.150 
spaces for Mexicans and I
there<00:02:13.570> will<00:02:13.960> see<00:02:14.200> more<00:02:14.350> rules<00:02:14.620> in<00:02:14.800> the<00:02:14.890> second

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
there will see more rules in the second

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.550 
there will see more rules in the second
my<00:02:15.550> pic<00:02:15.730> actually<00:02:16.000> for<00:02:16.150> this<00:02:16.270> match<00:02:16.810> is<00:02:17.020> Mexico

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
my pic actually for this match is Mexico

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.560 
my pic actually for this match is Mexico
to<00:02:17.740> win<00:02:17.980> by<00:02:18.220> both<00:02:18.520> halves<00:02:18.880> that's<00:02:19.150> priced<00:02:19.390> at

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:19.570 
to win by both halves that's priced at

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:22.500 
to win by both halves that's priced at
3.4<00:02:20.470> they've<00:02:21.130> got<00:02:21.250> a<00:02:21.280> very<00:02:21.340> strong<00:02:21.760> attack<00:02:22.270> I

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
3.4 they've got a very strong attack I

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:23.760 
3.4 they've got a very strong attack I
think<00:02:22.870> they're<00:02:22.960> going<00:02:23.050> to<00:02:23.140> come<00:02:23.320> into<00:02:23.590> the

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:23.770 
think they're going to come into the

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:25.320 
think they're going to come into the
second<00:02:24.280> leg<00:02:24.460> and<00:02:24.670> I<00:02:24.700> think<00:02:24.910> that<00:02:25.030> we're<00:02:25.240> going

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330 
second leg and I think that we're going

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:27.660 
second leg and I think that we're going
to<00:02:25.390> see<00:02:25.600> even<00:02:25.960> more<00:02:26.260> of<00:02:26.320> it<00:02:26.560> I<00:02:26.800> looked<00:02:27.460> at<00:02:27.580> the

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
to see even more of it I looked at the

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:30.150 
to see even more of it I looked at the
total<00:02:28.030> goals<00:02:28.240> market<00:02:28.810> and<00:02:29.050> the<00:02:29.860> book<00:02:29.980> is<00:02:30.040> have

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 
total goals market and the book is have

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:31.980 
total goals market and the book is have
pretty<00:02:30.340> much<00:02:30.400> got<00:02:30.640> that<00:02:30.790> covered<00:02:31.090> I<00:02:31.420> think<00:02:31.870> as

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:31.990 
pretty much got that covered I think as

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:33.930 
pretty much got that covered I think as
a<00:02:32.020> result<00:02:32.470> of<00:02:32.590> the<00:02:32.830> first<00:02:33.100> leg<00:02:33.340> total<00:02:33.730> goals

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 
a result of the first leg total goals

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:35.970 
a result of the first leg total goals
scored<00:02:34.240> in<00:02:34.360> that<00:02:34.540> match<00:02:34.840> what<00:02:35.680> do<00:02:35.740> you<00:02:35.830> make<00:02:35.920> of
