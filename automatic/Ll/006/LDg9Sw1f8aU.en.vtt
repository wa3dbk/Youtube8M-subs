00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.420
 all right 

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:09.549
 according to the article published by the 

00:00:07.149 --> 00:00:11.770
 doctor ws rocker of the Soviet Union 

00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:13.959
 the human being will evolve to 

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:18.220
 adapt to the highly toxic environment 

00:00:13.959 --> 00:00:20.320
 that the planet will have the year 2,768 this 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:22.630
 article was published the previous century 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:25.350
 this purely scientific rigor although 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:27.900
 look hypothetical 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.580
 eyes the eyes will have to endure the 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.590
 contact with contaminants of the 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.450
 atmosphere thereby develop a 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.700
 membrane similar to those possessed by 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.739
 pigs now this membrane can be 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.320
 find in the inner corner of the eye 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.930
 said membrane will serve as a second 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.170
 eyelid 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:47.270
 2 nose the nose will be one of the parties 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:49.790
 of the body more will vary with the passage of 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:51.860
 over the years it will increase in size to 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:54.500
 give part to new compartments and 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:58.420
 filters to purify the air hairs 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:01:01.359
 of the nose will be longer and thicker 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:03.609
 three lungs plus an increase of 

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:06.009
 size will have a connection to the 

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:08.880
 circulatory system this in order to 

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:11.700
 extract more oxygen 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.979
 4 liver the liver will have a greater 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.079
 performance by purifying the blood by 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.850
 it will increase in size and will have 

00:01:16.079 --> 00:01:19.990
 the ability to filter substances 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:23.140
 poisonous 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:25.270
 5 skin in addition to more 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:27.430
 ability to protect from activity 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:28.780
 solar will have qualified areas for 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:31.280
 avoid by chemical substances 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:34.520
 contaminants 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:36.590
 6 appendix how meat will become 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.659
 in not suitable for human consumption the 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:40.940
 appendix will leave its surface paper 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:43.130
 to help transform any type 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:46.280
 of vegetable food 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:48.200
 7 structure that is the lack of vitamin 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.230
 d will make the human skeleton more 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.930
 light and fragile 

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:54.370
 8 hair the strong increase of 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:58.040
 temperature due to heating 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:02:00.710
 global will make the hair disappear 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:03.050
 nine ears the noise will make the 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:05.150
 ears increase their size and have a 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:06.950
 fold similar to the dogs 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:09.050
 human will be able to raise the fold to 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.660
 listen better or lower it to reduce the 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:13.540
 noise 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:15.400
 10 temperament the increase of 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:17.530
 toxic substances will cause the 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.920
 Human temperament is more crazy 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:22.800
 and temperamental 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:25.140
 11 respiratory devices all 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.090
 neonates will need a special unit 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:30.360
 of breathing which will help 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:33.540
 survive the first weeks of life 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.170
 12 kidneys the fluid retention was 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.240
 vital 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:38.220
 therefore the kidneys will change their function 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:40.560
 and instead of liquid urine will produce 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:44.150
 a kind of power composed of acid 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.150
 uric and toxic substances
