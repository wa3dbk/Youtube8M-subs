00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:40.060 
but I really don't try that as a lot
because<00:02:38.660> not<00:02:39.320> really<00:02:39.350> good<00:02:39.650> for<00:02:39.680> your<00:02:39.920> health

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:40.070 
because not really good for your health

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:44.380 
because not really good for your health
but<00:02:40.510> also<00:02:42.100> on<00:02:43.100> the<00:02:43.220> sandwich<00:02:43.490> the<00:02:43.700> bacon<00:02:44.180> was

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 
but also on the sandwich the bacon was

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:47.340 
but also on the sandwich the bacon was
fantastic<00:02:45.380> it<00:02:45.950> was<00:02:46.100> well<00:02:46.310> cooked<00:02:46.610> and<00:02:46.940> the

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:47.350 
fantastic it was well cooked and the

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:49.870 
fantastic it was well cooked and the
zesty<00:02:48.350> sauce<00:02:48.500> was<00:02:48.830> a<00:02:48.860> little<00:02:48.890> bit<00:02:49.130> zesty<00:02:49.700> I

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:49.880 
zesty sauce was a little bit zesty I

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:52.480 
zesty sauce was a little bit zesty I
never<00:02:50.570> tried<00:02:50.960> the<00:02:51.110> actual<00:02:51.500> zesty<00:02:51.980> sauce<00:02:52.130> from

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:52.490 
never tried the actual zesty sauce from

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:55.600 
never tried the actual zesty sauce from
from<00:02:53.120> burning<00:02:53.450> but<00:02:53.630> this<00:02:54.170> one<00:02:54.320> I<00:02:54.350> really<00:02:54.800> kind

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:55.610 
from burning but this one I really kind

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:58.570 
from burning but this one I really kind
of<00:02:55.670> enjoyed<00:02:55.940> a<00:02:55.970> little<00:02:56.270> bit<00:02:56.770> but<00:02:57.770> to<00:02:58.250> me<00:02:58.400> my

00:02:58.570 --> 00:02:58.580 
of enjoyed a little bit but to me my

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:01.180 
of enjoyed a little bit but to me my
mind<00:02:58.850> I<00:02:59.120> think<00:02:59.870> with<00:03:00.050> the<00:03:00.140> zesty<00:03:00.530> sauce<00:03:00.710> it<00:03:01.070> was

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.190 
mind I think with the zesty sauce it was

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:05.320 
mind I think with the zesty sauce it was
too<00:03:01.460> much<00:03:01.820> with<00:03:02.720> the<00:03:03.020> cheese<00:03:03.530> the<00:03:04.370> pepper<00:03:04.670> jack

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:05.330 
too much with the cheese the pepper jack

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:07.900 
too much with the cheese the pepper jack
cheese<00:03:05.780> I<00:03:06.110> think<00:03:06.440> that's<00:03:06.590> what<00:03:06.800> I<00:03:06.980> think<00:03:07.640> was

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:07.910 
cheese I think that's what I think was

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:10.570 
cheese I think that's what I think was
that<00:03:07.970> was<00:03:08.240> what<00:03:08.390> it<00:03:08.480> was<00:03:08.590> so<00:03:09.590> I<00:03:09.950> think<00:03:10.130> if<00:03:10.430> they

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:10.580 
that was what it was so I think if they

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:12.910 
that was what it was so I think if they
added<00:03:10.850> like<00:03:10.940> a<00:03:10.970> cheddar<00:03:11.360> or<00:03:11.660> mozzarella<00:03:11.920> it

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:12.920 
added like a cheddar or mozzarella it

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:15.700 
added like a cheddar or mozzarella it
would<00:03:13.040> have<00:03:13.130> been<00:03:13.190> better<00:03:13.510> but<00:03:14.510> an<00:03:14.690> overall<00:03:15.440> I

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:15.710 
would have been better but an overall I

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:17.830 
would have been better but an overall I
would<00:03:15.920> probably<00:03:16.280> give<00:03:16.550> it<00:03:16.580> probably<00:03:17.300> a<00:03:17.420> five

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 
would probably give it probably a five

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.230 
would probably give it probably a five
stars<00:03:18.230> because<00:03:18.590> it<00:03:19.490> was<00:03:19.610> a<00:03:19.640> really<00:03:20.000> good

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:20.240 
stars because it was a really good

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:22.930 
stars because it was a really good
