know<00:00:34.590> keeps<00:00:34.829> everything<00:00:35.100> organized<00:00:35.670> so<00:00:36.180> let's

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
know keeps everything organized so let's

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.530 
know keeps everything organized so let's
take<00:00:36.480> a<00:00:36.510> look<00:00:36.660> at<00:00:36.840> it<00:00:37.850> as<00:00:38.850> you<00:00:38.969> can<00:00:39.149> see<00:00:39.300> here

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
take a look at it as you can see here

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:40.970 
take a look at it as you can see here
you<00:00:39.690> know<00:00:39.780> it's<00:00:39.960> a<00:00:40.050> pretty<00:00:40.260> elaborate<00:00:40.649> setup

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
you know it's a pretty elaborate setup

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.440 
you know it's a pretty elaborate setup
but<00:00:41.219> when<00:00:41.520> you're<00:00:41.640> putting<00:00:41.790> it<00:00:41.940> together<00:00:42.059> it

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
but when you're putting it together it

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.330 
but when you're putting it together it
only<00:00:42.570> takes<00:00:42.809> about<00:00:42.930> 15<00:00:43.440> to<00:00:43.469> 30<00:00:43.800> minutes<00:00:43.950> to<00:00:44.160> put

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
only takes about 15 to 30 minutes to put

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:45.740 
only takes about 15 to 30 minutes to put
it<00:00:44.430> up<00:00:44.550> it<00:00:44.850> really<00:00:45.059> didn't<00:00:45.300> take<00:00:45.360> that<00:00:45.600> much

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
it up it really didn't take that much

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.200 
it up it really didn't take that much
time<00:00:46.020> and<00:00:46.230> there's<00:00:46.680> only<00:00:46.950> about<00:00:47.129> 9<00:00:47.550> steps<00:00:48.000> to

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
time and there's only about 9 steps to

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.600 
time and there's only about 9 steps to
the<00:00:48.300> directions<00:00:48.950> literally<00:00:49.950> the<00:00:50.070> 9<00:00:50.250> steps

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
the directions literally the 9 steps

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.760 
the directions literally the 9 steps
come<00:00:50.879> in<00:00:51.000> a<00:00:51.090> single<00:00:51.420> sheet<00:00:51.629> very<00:00:52.379> easy<00:00:52.590> to

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
come in a single sheet very easy to

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.810 
come in a single sheet very easy to
understand<00:00:53.539> everything<00:00:54.539> was<00:00:55.320> in<00:00:55.590> the<00:00:55.710> box<00:00:55.890> and

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
understand everything was in the box and

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.340 
understand everything was in the box and
really<00:00:57.059> have<00:00:57.270> any<00:00:57.480> huge<00:00:57.750> problems

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
really have any huge problems

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.049 
really have any huge problems
the<00:00:58.680> only<00:00:58.829> thing<00:00:59.039> is<00:00:59.160> one<00:00:59.340> of<00:00:59.430> the<00:00:59.520> inside

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
the only thing is one of the inside

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.170 
the only thing is one of the inside
hooks<00:01:00.500> did<00:01:01.500> need<00:01:01.680> to<00:01:01.710> be<00:01:01.829> reversed<00:01:02.250> with<00:01:02.579> a

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
hooks did need to be reversed with a

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.759 
hooks did need to be reversed with a
drill<00:01:03.600> so<00:01:03.840> that<00:01:04.049> really<00:01:04.290> didn't<00:01:04.530> take<00:01:04.650> too

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
drill so that really didn't take too

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.649 
drill so that really didn't take too
much<00:01:04.920> time<00:01:05.189> it<00:01:05.640> wasn't<00:01:05.909> that<00:01:06.090> big<00:01:06.270> of<00:01:06.330> a<00:01:06.479> deal

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
much time it wasn't that big of a deal

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.740 
much time it wasn't that big of a deal
to<00:01:06.689> go<00:01:06.930> ahead<00:01:07.049> and<00:01:07.380> fix<00:01:08.180> you<00:01:09.180> can<00:01:09.210> see<00:01:09.479> here

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
to go ahead and fix you can see here

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:10.670 
to go ahead and fix you can see here
that<00:01:09.930> there<00:01:10.110> are<00:01:10.200> many<00:01:10.350> different

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
that there are many different

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.130 
that there are many different
combinations<00:01:10.830> that<00:01:11.400> you<00:01:11.520> can<00:01:11.790> use<00:01:12.180> if<00:01:12.930> you<00:01:13.049> go

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
combinations that you can use if you go

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.080 
combinations that you can use if you go
on<00:01:13.229> their<00:01:13.350> website<00:01:13.470> you<00:01:13.920> can<00:01:14.070> see<00:01:14.220> here<00:01:14.850> on<00:01:14.970> the

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
on their website you can see here on the

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.899 
on their website you can see here on the
right<00:01:15.299> side<00:01:15.540> and<00:01:15.960> on<00:01:16.080> the<00:01:16.200> left<00:01:16.439> side<00:01:16.909> there's

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
right side and on the left side there's

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.910 
right side and on the left side there's
goalie<00:01:18.119> pads<00:01:18.420> up<00:01:18.630> there<00:01:18.810> now<00:01:19.229> I<00:01:19.259> prefer<00:01:19.530> to<00:01:19.770> put

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
goalie pads up there now I prefer to put

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.679 
goalie pads up there now I prefer to put
mine<00:01:20.100> down<00:01:20.310> at<00:01:20.909> the<00:01:21.000> bottom<00:01:21.150> and<00:01:21.509> I<00:01:21.540> have<00:01:21.570> a

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
mine down at the bottom and I have a

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.510 
mine down at the bottom and I have a
dehumidifier<00:01:22.140> down<00:01:22.590> there<00:01:22.799> to<00:01:23.159> help<00:01:23.280> with<00:01:23.460> the

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
dehumidifier down there to help with the

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.140 
dehumidifier down there to help with the
drying<00:01:23.790> process<00:01:23.930> so<00:01:24.930> really<00:01:25.200> it's<00:01:25.320> up<00:01:25.409> to<00:01:25.590> you

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:26.150 
drying process so really it's up to you

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:28.490 
drying process so really it's up to you
now<00:01:27.150> if<00:01:27.240> I<00:01:27.330> take<00:01:27.509> these<00:01:27.659> down<00:01:27.869> you<00:01:28.049> can<00:01:28.170> see<00:01:28.350> the

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
now if I take these down you can see the

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.039 
now if I take these down you can see the
inside<00:01:28.860> better<00:01:29.270> there<00:01:30.270> are<00:01:30.390> actually<00:01:30.780> three

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
inside better there are actually three

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.460 
inside better there are actually three
shelves<00:01:32.329> there's<00:01:33.329> a<00:01:33.390> top<00:01:33.630> shelf<00:01:33.869> where

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
shelves there's a top shelf where

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.590 
shelves there's a top shelf where
generally<00:01:34.860> you'll<00:01:34.979> put<00:01:35.250> your<00:01:35.400> mask<00:01:35.700> and<00:01:36.390> you

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
generally you'll put your mask and you

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:37.910 
generally you'll put your mask and you
can't<00:01:36.780> really<00:01:36.930> see<00:01:37.140> it<00:01:37.170> from<00:01:37.259> that<00:01:37.470> angle<00:01:37.680> but

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
can't really see it from that angle but

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.600 
can't really see it from that angle but
there<00:01:38.610> are<00:01:39.020> metal<00:01:40.020> dowels<00:01:40.259> up<00:01:40.770> there<00:01:41.040> that<00:01:41.220> you

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
there are metal dowels up there that you

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.429 
there are metal dowels up there that you
know<00:01:41.700> really<00:01:41.909> allow<00:01:42.150> you<00:01:42.210> to<00:01:42.899> have<00:01:43.020> that<00:01:43.049> air

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
know really allow you to have that air

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.030 
know really allow you to have that air
come<00:01:43.829> on<00:01:43.950> through<00:01:44.100> the<00:01:44.220> mask<00:01:44.430> and<00:01:44.670> dry<00:01:44.850> it<00:01:44.909> out

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:46.040 
come on through the mask and dry it out
