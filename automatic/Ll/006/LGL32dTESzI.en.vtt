somebody so just looking around the bike
a<00:00:50.969> few<00:00:51.239> little<00:00:51.329> things<00:00:51.449> to<00:00:51.690> point<00:00:51.840> out<00:00:54.590> the

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:56.000 
a few little things to point out the

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.389 
a few little things to point out the
bike<00:00:57.000> looks<00:00:57.270> to<00:00:57.420> me<00:00:57.539> like<00:00:57.570> been<00:00:57.989> fitted<00:00:58.350> with

00:00:58.389 --> 00:00:58.399 
bike looks to me like been fitted with

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:01.729 
bike looks to me like been fitted with
some<00:00:59.399> easy<00:00:59.670> steer<00:01:00.120> yokes<00:01:00.480> nothing<00:01:00.960> knows<00:01:01.140> they

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
some easy steer yokes nothing knows they

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.170 
some easy steer yokes nothing knows they
might<00:01:01.980> not<00:01:02.190> be<00:01:02.340> easiest<00:01:02.579> if<00:01:02.760> they're<00:01:03.090> not

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
might not be easiest if they're not

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.609 
might not be easiest if they're not
they're<00:01:03.329> a<00:01:03.359> similar<00:01:03.809> kind<00:01:03.989> of<00:01:04.140> a<00:01:04.229> thing<00:01:04.470> with

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
they're a similar kind of a thing with

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.010 
they're a similar kind of a thing with
the<00:01:04.680> extensions<00:01:05.309> to<00:01:05.460> get<00:01:05.610> the<00:01:05.760> geometry<00:01:06.020> nice

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
the extensions to get the geometry nice

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.780 
the extensions to get the geometry nice
for<00:01:07.350> riding<00:01:07.560> it<00:01:07.799> and<00:01:07.950> it<00:01:08.040> does<00:01:08.189> it<00:01:08.340> rise<00:01:08.520> just

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
for riding it and it does it rise just

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:14.929 
for riding it and it does it rise just
fine<00:01:09.030> when<00:01:09.210> you're<00:01:09.270> going<00:01:09.420> along<00:01:13.610> so<00:01:14.610> it's<00:01:14.820> got

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
fine when you're going along so it's got

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.490 
fine when you're going along so it's got
a<00:01:14.970> huge<00:01:15.180> fuel<00:01:15.509> tank<00:01:15.780> on<00:01:15.869> it<00:01:16.049> I'll<00:01:16.200> point<00:01:16.380> that

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
a huge fuel tank on it I'll point that

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:17.990 
a huge fuel tank on it I'll point that
out<00:01:16.680> because<00:01:16.860> the<00:01:17.100> v-max<00:01:17.430> has<00:01:17.640> come<00:01:17.820> with<00:01:17.970> a

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
out because the v-max has come with a

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.460 
out because the v-max has come with a
pretty<00:01:18.330> small<00:01:18.570> fuel<00:01:18.930> tank

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
pretty small fuel tank

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.410 
pretty small fuel tank
normy<00:01:20.040> so<00:01:20.220> you<00:01:20.280> know<00:01:20.490> that<00:01:20.640> a<00:01:20.670> much<00:01:21.030> larger

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
normy so you know that a much larger

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:22.520 
normy so you know that a much larger
tank<00:01:21.630> on<00:01:21.810> the<00:01:21.900> back<00:01:22.049> they're<00:01:22.229> made<00:01:22.380> out<00:01:22.409> of

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
tank on the back they're made out of

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.929 
tank on the back they're made out of
stainless<00:01:22.860> steel

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.090 

when<00:01:27.939> the<00:01:28.119> mudguard<00:01:28.329> fell<00:01:28.899> off<00:01:29.350> I<00:01:29.380> think<00:01:29.979> the

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:30.100 
when the mudguard fell off I think the

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:31.889 
when the mudguard fell off I think the
indicator<00:01:30.640> stopped<00:01:30.939> working<00:01:31.329> might<00:01:31.570> find

00:01:31.889 --> 00:01:31.899 
indicator stopped working might find

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:33.899 
indicator stopped working might find
monetary<00:01:32.890> available<00:01:33.340> things<00:01:33.520> Marshall

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:33.909 
monetary available things Marshall

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:35.279 
monetary available things Marshall
workers<00:01:34.390> well<00:01:34.570> I<00:01:34.600> didn't<00:01:34.780> actually<00:01:34.869> check

00:01:35.279 --> 00:01:35.289 
workers well I didn't actually check

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:36.840 
workers well I didn't actually check
that<00:01:35.500> my<00:01:35.590> notice<00:01:35.859> they<00:01:36.039> obviously<00:01:36.700> the

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:36.850 
that my notice they obviously the

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:38.849 
that my notice they obviously the
indicator<00:01:37.299> when<00:01:37.960> their<00:01:38.109> side<00:01:38.319> was<00:01:38.439> no<00:01:38.560> longer

00:01:38.849 --> 00:01:38.859 
indicator when their side was no longer

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:40.319 
indicator when their side was no longer
working<00:01:39.100> see<00:01:39.399> money<00:01:39.579> to<00:01:39.789> look<00:01:39.909> at<00:01:40.060> that<00:01:40.149> make

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:40.329 
working see money to look at that make

00:01:40.329 --> 00:01:46.669 
working see money to look at that make
sure<00:01:42.149> that's<00:01:43.149> okay<00:01:44.789> this<00:01:45.789> is<00:01:45.850> the<00:01:46.119> monk<00:01:46.360> guard

00:01:46.669 --> 00:01:46.679 
sure that's okay this is the monk guard

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:49.649 
sure that's okay this is the monk guard
area<00:01:47.679> fell<00:01:48.310> off<00:01:48.490> and<00:01:48.729> you<00:01:48.850> see<00:01:49.000> this<00:01:49.179> bracket

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:49.659 
area fell off and you see this bracket

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:52.440 
area fell off and you see this bracket
here<00:01:49.899> is<00:01:50.020> now<00:01:50.170> bent<00:01:50.530> I've<00:01:51.340> tied<00:01:51.700> up<00:01:51.939> the<00:01:52.119> loose

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:52.450 
here is now bent I've tied up the loose

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:54.059 
here is now bent I've tied up the loose
bits<00:01:52.630> they<00:01:52.810> were<00:01:52.929> string<00:01:53.229> and<00:01:53.409> the<00:01:53.469> wiring<00:01:53.709> is

00:01:54.059 --> 00:01:54.069 
bits they were string and the wiring is

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:58.889 
bits they were string and the wiring is
still<00:01:54.340> there<00:01:54.759> of<00:01:54.939> course<00:01:56.670> it<00:01:57.670> isn't<00:01:57.850> I<00:01:58.390> think

00:01:58.889 --> 00:01:58.899 
still there of course it isn't I think

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:01.139 
still there of course it isn't I think
the<00:01:59.170> way<00:01:59.380> the<00:01:59.409> mud<00:01:59.829> guard<00:02:00.069> was<00:02:00.280> fitted<00:02:00.700> wasn't

00:02:01.139 --> 00:02:01.149 
the way the mud guard was fitted wasn't

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:03.779 
the way the mud guard was fitted wasn't
ideal<00:02:01.630> there's<00:02:01.959> a<00:02:01.989> bracket<00:02:02.920> which<00:02:03.220> broke<00:02:03.489> off

00:02:03.779 --> 00:02:03.789 
ideal there's a bracket which broke off

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:05.429 
ideal there's a bracket which broke off
there<00:02:04.119> which<00:02:04.239> could<00:02:04.450> be<00:02:04.599> welded<00:02:04.840> back<00:02:05.140> on<00:02:05.319> it

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:05.439 
there which could be welded back on it

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:06.569 
there which could be welded back on it
but<00:02:05.590> I<00:02:05.679> think<00:02:05.829> what<00:02:05.950> you<00:02:06.039> need<00:02:06.189> to<00:02:06.310> do<00:02:06.459> is

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:06.579 
but I think what you need to do is

00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:08.309 
but I think what you need to do is
actually<00:02:06.759> embrace<00:02:07.239> it<00:02:07.479> a<00:02:07.569> little<00:02:07.780> bit<00:02:07.989> better

00:02:08.309 --> 00:02:08.319 
actually embrace it a little bit better

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:09.990 
actually embrace it a little bit better
than<00:02:08.619> what<00:02:08.739> it<00:02:08.769> has<00:02:08.950> been<00:02:09.190> when<00:02:09.700> you<00:02:09.789> look<00:02:09.910> at

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 
than what it has been when you look at

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.729 
than what it has been when you look at
the<00:02:10.090> other<00:02:10.239> side<00:02:10.509> which<00:02:10.840> was<00:02:11.019> okay<00:02:11.470> at<00:02:11.650> the

00:02:11.729 --> 00:02:11.739 
the other side which was okay at the

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:13.410 
the other side which was okay at the
moment<00:02:12.099> it's<00:02:12.640> still<00:02:12.790> a<00:02:12.819> little<00:02:13.030> bit<00:02:13.239> more

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
moment it's still a little bit more

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:15.720 
moment it's still a little bit more
flimsy<00:02:13.629> side<00:02:14.049> so<00:02:14.260> you<00:02:14.319> really<00:02:14.560> want<00:02:14.709> make<00:02:15.549> that

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
flimsy side so you really want make that

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:17.970 
flimsy side so you really want make that
a<00:02:15.760> bit<00:02:15.970> he<00:02:16.690> surprised<00:02:17.140> me<00:02:17.230> the<00:02:17.410> recipe<00:02:17.680> looks

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
a bit he surprised me the recipe looks

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:21.110 
a bit he surprised me the recipe looks
fairly<00:02:18.340> well<00:02:18.579> done<00:02:18.849> but<00:02:19.150> anyway<00:02:19.480> there's<00:02:19.660> that

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
fairly well done but anyway there's that

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.990 
fairly well done but anyway there's that
is<00:02:22.120> is<00:02:22.269> the<00:02:22.329> other<00:02:22.360> side<00:02:22.750> there<00:02:23.019> I<00:02:23.849> notice<00:02:24.849> if

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
is is the other side there I notice if

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.819 
is is the other side there I notice if
you<00:02:25.150> kind<00:02:25.360> of<00:02:25.420> have<00:02:25.480> these<00:02:25.780> box<00:02:26.110> loose<00:02:26.410> air<00:02:26.650> the

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:26.829 
you kind of have these box loose air the

00:02:26.829 --> 00:02:28.350 
you kind of have these box loose air the
mud<00:02:27.010> Garcons<00:02:27.370> ought<00:02:27.489> to<00:02:27.579> go<00:02:27.670> down<00:02:27.700> on<00:02:28.150> both

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
mud Garcons ought to go down on both

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.840 
mud Garcons ought to go down on both
sides<00:02:28.629> onto<00:02:28.989> the<00:02:29.110> wheel<00:02:29.290> there<00:02:29.560> so<00:02:29.799> and<00:02:30.670> it

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:30.850 
sides onto the wheel there so and it

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:32.970 
sides onto the wheel there so and it
kind<00:02:31.000> of<00:02:31.060> isn't<00:02:31.690> strong<00:02:32.109> like<00:02:32.350> the<00:02:32.500> rest<00:02:32.680> of<00:02:32.829> it

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
kind of isn't strong like the rest of it

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:37.080 
kind of isn't strong like the rest of it
anyway<00:02:33.609> so<00:02:33.639> there's<00:02:34.030> that<00:02:35.790> that's<00:02:36.790> the<00:02:36.910> mud

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
anyway so there's that that's the mud

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.180 
anyway so there's that that's the mud
guard<00:02:37.329> that<00:02:37.540> um<00:02:37.870> that<00:02:38.290> fell<00:02:38.620> off<00:02:38.799> and<00:02:39.040> that's

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
guard that um that fell off and that's

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:42.059 
guard that um that fell off and that's
where<00:02:39.489> the<00:02:40.139> bracket<00:02:41.139> itself<00:02:41.260> we<00:02:41.769> actually

00:02:42.059 --> 00:02:42.069 
where the bracket itself we actually

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:44.039 
where the bracket itself we actually
look<00:02:42.250> at<00:02:42.370> the<00:02:42.430> the<00:02:43.030> bracket<00:02:43.420> so<00:02:43.510> it<00:02:43.750> looks<00:02:43.900> to

00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:44.049 
look at the the bracket so it looks to

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:46.020 
look at the the bracket so it looks to
me<00:02:44.170> like<00:02:44.200> he's<00:02:44.620> got<00:02:44.650> corrosion<00:02:45.370> inside<00:02:45.519> this

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
me like he's got corrosion inside this

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:47.400 
me like he's got corrosion inside this
or<00:02:46.209> the<00:02:46.359> edge<00:02:46.420> where<00:02:46.660> it<00:02:46.750> was<00:02:46.930> I<00:02:46.959> might<00:02:47.319> have

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.410 
or the edge where it was I might have

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:48.780 
or the edge where it was I might have
been<00:02:47.500> broken<00:02:47.769> some<00:02:48.160> time<00:02:48.430> for<00:02:48.609> it<00:02:48.670> actually

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
been broken some time for it actually

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:49.759 
been broken some time for it actually
came<00:02:49.180> off

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:49.769 
came off

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:52.259 
came off
I<00:02:50.769> doubt<00:02:51.400> with<00:02:51.549> you<00:02:51.670> to<00:02:51.730> straighten<00:02:52.120> out

00:02:52.259 --> 00:02:52.269 
I doubt with you to straighten out

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:54.420 
I doubt with you to straighten out

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
anyone made of steel of course you know

anyone made of steel of course you know
that<00:02:56.130> the<00:02:57.130> paint<00:02:57.400> around<00:02:57.609> the<00:02:58.030> engine<00:02:58.389> has

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
that the paint around the engine has

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.569 
that the paint around the engine has
blanked<00:02:59.650> off<00:02:59.739> of<00:02:59.889> it<00:02:59.980> they<00:03:00.069> could<00:03:00.250> have<00:03:00.280> been

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:00.579 
blanked off of it they could have been

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:06.930 
blanked off of it they could have been
redone<00:03:01.120> at<00:03:01.989> some<00:03:02.260> point<00:03:04.769> it's<00:03:05.769> tax<00:03:06.069> until<00:03:06.549> end

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:06.940 
redone at some point it's tax until end
