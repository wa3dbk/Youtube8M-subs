00:00:01.969 --> 00:00:01.979 
hi I'm Mary Rogers and this is the

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:03.619 
hi I'm Mary Rogers and this is the
Cuisinart<00:00:02.520> one<00:00:02.730> and<00:00:02.909> a<00:00:02.970> half<00:00:03.179> quart

compressor style ice cream and gelato
maker<00:00:06.859> you<00:00:07.859> can<00:00:07.890> do<00:00:08.160> both<00:00:08.429> styles<00:00:09.059> of<00:00:09.330> desserts

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
maker you can do both styles of desserts

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:12.080 
maker you can do both styles of desserts
and<00:00:10.080> the<00:00:10.469> reason<00:00:10.860> is<00:00:11.010> we<00:00:11.219> have<00:00:11.400> two<00:00:11.700> different

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
and the reason is we have two different

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.049 
and the reason is we have two different
paddles<00:00:12.719> one<00:00:13.500> is<00:00:13.740> specifically<00:00:14.340> designed<00:00:14.610> for

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
paddles one is specifically designed for

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.029 
paddles one is specifically designed for
ice<00:00:15.330> cream<00:00:15.719> and<00:00:15.900> the<00:00:16.080> other<00:00:16.230> is<00:00:16.470> specifically

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
ice cream and the other is specifically

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.000 
ice cream and the other is specifically
designed<00:00:17.310> for<00:00:17.850> gelato<00:00:18.690> and<00:00:18.960> the<00:00:19.439> reason<00:00:19.859> is

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
designed for gelato and the reason is

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.220 
designed for gelato and the reason is
that<00:00:20.039> gelato<00:00:20.730> has<00:00:20.850> a<00:00:21.060> lot<00:00:21.359> less<00:00:21.600> air<00:00:21.840> in<00:00:22.080> it

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
that gelato has a lot less air in it

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.859 
that gelato has a lot less air in it
it's<00:00:22.410> much<00:00:22.710> more<00:00:22.949> dense<00:00:23.340> than<00:00:24.119> an<00:00:24.330> ice<00:00:24.480> cream

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
it's much more dense than an ice cream

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:26.990 
it's much more dense than an ice cream
ice<00:00:25.140> cream<00:00:25.199> is<00:00:25.619> more<00:00:25.800> aerated<00:00:26.430> and<00:00:26.550> so<00:00:26.730> we<00:00:26.849> have

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
ice cream is more aerated and so we have

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.849 
ice cream is more aerated and so we have
designed<00:00:27.480> two<00:00:27.660> different<00:00:28.199> paddles<00:00:28.560> for<00:00:28.769> you

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
designed two different paddles for you

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.460 
designed two different paddles for you
to<00:00:29.010> use<00:00:29.220> to<00:00:29.789> get<00:00:29.910> the<00:00:30.090> perfect<00:00:30.510> result<00:00:30.630> for<00:00:31.439> a

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
to use to get the perfect result for a

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.370 
to use to get the perfect result for a
great<00:00:31.800> gelato<00:00:32.250> or<00:00:32.460> an<00:00:32.910> ice<00:00:33.059> cream<00:00:33.390> the<00:00:34.260> other
