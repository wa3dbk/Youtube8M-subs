00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
corsair 350 the obsidian series case

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.420 
corsair 350 the obsidian series case
this<00:00:15.660> is<00:00:15.900> a<00:00:15.929> very<00:00:16.289> small<00:00:16.560> form-factor<00:00:16.890> case

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
this is a very small form-factor case

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.609 
this is a very small form-factor case
and<00:00:17.789> it's<00:00:17.940> perfect<00:00:18.390> for<00:00:18.449> matx<00:00:19.050> builds<00:00:19.500> which

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
and it's perfect for matx builds which

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.800 
and it's perfect for matx builds which
is<00:00:19.800> what<00:00:19.980> my<00:00:20.279> build<00:00:20.850> is<00:00:20.970> actually<00:00:21.270> going<00:00:21.449> to<00:00:21.630> be
