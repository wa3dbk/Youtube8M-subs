00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
and then get up some hazard so my plan

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.340 
and then get up some hazard so my plan
was<00:00:47.370> to<00:00:47.430> go<00:00:47.579> out<00:00:47.640> to<00:00:47.760> my<00:00:47.850> drag<00:00:48.000> on<00:00:48.270> and<00:00:48.450> go<00:00:49.170> for

I<00:03:06.650> think<00:03:06.739> max<00:03:07.040> damage<00:03:07.280> is<00:03:07.489> like<00:03:07.610> 208<00:03:08.180> and<00:03:08.360> I'm

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:08.540 
I think max damage is like 208 and I'm

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:10.750 
I think max damage is like 208 and I'm
like<00:03:08.690> 216<00:03:09.319> slightly<00:03:09.680> above<00:03:09.890> that<00:03:10.040> so<00:03:10.280> I<00:03:10.489> could

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760 
like 216 slightly above that so I could

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.039 
like 216 slightly above that so I could
take<00:03:10.849> any<00:03:11.000> hit<00:03:11.180> go<00:03:11.299> for<00:03:11.420> the<00:03:11.480> bolts<00:03:11.720> which<00:03:11.840> he's
