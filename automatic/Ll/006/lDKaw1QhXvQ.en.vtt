00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.000
 back this video 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:35.720
 on the screen where better playstation 

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:35.720
 xbox playstation with strip 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:43.820
 what you buy are the gifts 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:46.910
 great buy a 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:50.480
 a king be nothing more 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:52.130
 It has two buttons on one side and it's 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:55.240
 quite 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:59.080
 for pc games no 

00:00:55.240 --> 00:01:02.220
 It has moves very good quality 

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:06.330
 just where you want to point 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:09.110
 to see what else this is the the stretch 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.790
 with the keyboard 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:14.180
 is with the keyboard because here you have the 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:16.340
 you keep to play from and if for example and 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:19.570
 why are you fitting the buttons 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:22.960
 you do not want them this is just study 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:22.960
 the angels 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.640
 to this 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.100
 and the mouse 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:35.520
 which I like as the movement that 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.190
 has something very accurate where we do 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.430
 A lot for 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:41.930
 to be able to aim 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:47.450
 and ride and ride more people 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:51.770
 so you do not buy playstation this 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:54.670
 is fusion is what your control says 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:54.670

 I bought well everything I bought on ebay I 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.660

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.920
 what to do with 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:02.440

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:24.099

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:27.250

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:30.060

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:39.200
 films 

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:39.200
 There is something very important 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:42.420

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:49.520

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:23.979
 little expensive 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:25.280
