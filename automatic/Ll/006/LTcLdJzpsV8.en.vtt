00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
that a lot of people thought he should

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:37.670 
that a lot of people thought he should
have<00:00:36.780> done<00:00:36.989> enough<00:00:37.230> can<00:00:37.350> see<00:00:37.469> where<00:00:37.590> they're

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
have done enough can see where they're

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:38.900 
have done enough can see where they're
coming<00:00:37.710> from<00:00:37.950> but<00:00:38.430> I<00:00:38.520> thought<00:00:38.670> you'd<00:00:38.850> know

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910

Kate<00:00:39.210> and<00:00:39.480> I<00:00:39.540> don't<00:00:39.780> think<00:00:39.899> he<00:00:39.960> was

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
Kate and I don't think he was

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.240 
Kate and I don't think he was
particularly<00:00:40.500> bad<00:00:40.649> and<00:00:40.800> I<00:00:40.950> think<00:00:41.129> was<00:00:41.219> a

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
particularly bad and I think was a

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.580 
particularly bad and I think was a
little<00:00:41.430> bit<00:00:41.520> add<00:00:41.640> done<00:00:41.850> by<00:00:42.000> and<00:00:42.500> that's<00:00:43.500> a

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
little bit add done by and that's a

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:44.959 
little bit add done by and that's a
picture<00:00:43.920> one<00:00:44.040> who<00:00:44.100> fought<00:00:44.280> was<00:00:44.460> probably<00:00:44.700> our

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
picture one who fought was probably our

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.029 
picture one who fought was probably our
best<00:00:45.149> player<00:00:45.420> that<00:00:45.870> maybe<00:00:46.320> Jones<00:00:46.649> got<00:00:46.920> his

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
best player that maybe Jones got his

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.160 
best player that maybe Jones got his
goal<00:00:47.250> putting<00:00:47.789> some<00:00:47.940> tackles<00:00:48.390> sort<00:00:49.110> of

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
goal putting some tackles sort of

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.229 
goal putting some tackles sort of
stifled<00:00:49.620> them<00:00:49.739> a<00:00:49.770> little<00:00:49.950> bit<00:00:50.250> and<00:00:50.520> wasn't<00:00:51.180> a

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
stifled them a little bit and wasn't a

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:52.369 
stifled them a little bit and wasn't a
great<00:00:51.390> performance<00:00:51.870> all<00:00:52.050> around<00:00:52.079> but<00:00:52.320> I

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
great performance all around but I

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.139 
great performance all around but I
thought<00:00:52.530> Jones<00:00:52.800> did<00:00:52.980> okay<00:00:53.309> and<00:00:53.670> I<00:00:53.760> thought<00:00:53.910> him

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
thought Jones did okay and I thought him

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:55.729 
thought Jones did okay and I thought him
at<00:00:54.719> the<00:00:54.870> back<00:00:55.020> cover<00:00:55.260> than<00:00:55.379> a<00:00:55.440> couple<00:00:55.620> of

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
at the back cover than a couple of

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:56.900 
at the back cover than a couple of
wobbly<00:00:56.010> moments<00:00:56.340> from<00:00:56.430> Rio<00:00:56.579> I<00:00:56.670> thought

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
wobbly moments from Rio I thought

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.610

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
i mean you should never be difficult to

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.280 
i mean you should never be difficult to
get<00:01:12.090> motivated<00:01:12.479> for<00:01:12.630> a<00:01:12.720> game<00:01:12.840> manchester

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
usually these sort of games you don't

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.859 
usually these sort of games you don't
get<00:01:20.070> as<00:01:20.460> many<00:01:20.670> here<00:01:20.909> but<00:01:21.270> yeah<00:01:21.420> I<00:01:21.450> think<00:01:21.600> this

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
get as many here but yeah I think this

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.210 
get as many here but yeah I think this
this<00:01:22.229> isn't<00:01:22.500> the<00:01:22.560> game<00:01:22.710> where<00:01:22.890> you<00:01:22.950> can<00:01:23.070> always

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
this isn't the game where you can always

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.070 
this isn't the game where you can always
get<00:01:23.520> get<00:01:23.820> up<00:01:23.939> for<00:01:24.119> it<00:01:24.180> if<00:01:24.270> you<00:01:24.360> will<00:01:24.509> and<00:01:24.780> also

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
get get up for it if you will and also

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.359 
get get up for it if you will and also
you're<00:01:25.320> bringing<00:01:25.619> in<00:01:25.710> quite<00:01:25.890> a<00:01:25.920> few<00:01:26.009> fringe

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
you're bringing in quite a few fringe

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.399 
you're bringing in quite a few fringe
players<00:01:26.670> that<00:01:27.270> aren't<00:01:27.450> always<00:01:27.630> playing<00:01:27.990> so<00:01:28.229> I

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
players that aren't always playing so I

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:29.719 
players that aren't always playing so I
know<00:01:28.530> what<00:01:28.619> you<00:01:28.680> mean<00:01:28.799> about<00:01:28.860> the<00:01:29.100> same<00:01:29.400> sort
