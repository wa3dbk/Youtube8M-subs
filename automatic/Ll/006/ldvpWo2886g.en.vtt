where<00:05:20.520> they<00:05:20.640> are<00:05:20.820> eating<00:05:21.210> so

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:21.840 
where they are eating so

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:24.350 
where they are eating so
that<00:05:22.410> the<00:05:22.710> metabolism<00:05:23.280> slows<00:05:23.760> down<00:05:23.790> and

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:24.360 
that the metabolism slows down and

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:25.879 
that the metabolism slows down and
sometimes<00:05:24.630> I<00:05:24.930> need<00:05:24.990> to<00:05:25.169> kind<00:05:25.350> of<00:05:25.410> kick<00:05:25.620> it<00:05:25.770> up

00:05:25.879 --> 00:05:25.889 
sometimes I need to kind of kick it up

00:05:25.889 --> 00:05:27.920 
sometimes I need to kind of kick it up
by<00:05:26.550> adding<00:05:26.760> some<00:05:27.060> more<00:05:27.150> calories<00:05:27.660> for<00:05:27.870> a

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:27.930 
by adding some more calories for a

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:29.480 
by adding some more calories for a
little<00:05:28.139> bit<00:05:28.260> of<00:05:28.380> time<00:05:28.590> in<00:05:28.980> order<00:05:29.220> we<00:05:29.280> get<00:05:29.370> the

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:29.490 
little bit of time in order we get the

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:31.490 
little bit of time in order we get the
metabolism<00:05:30.060> up<00:05:30.360> so<00:05:30.510> they<00:05:30.600> can<00:05:30.750> start<00:05:31.020> or<00:05:31.320> lose

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:31.500 
metabolism up so they can start or lose

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:33.650 
metabolism up so they can start or lose
me<00:05:31.650> again<00:05:31.770> and<00:05:32.190> then<00:05:32.729> the<00:05:32.880> second<00:05:33.270> thing<00:05:33.419> the

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:33.660 
me again and then the second thing the

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:35.600 
me again and then the second thing the
third<00:05:33.870> thing<00:05:34.080> would<00:05:34.320> be<00:05:34.560> add<00:05:34.979> a<00:05:35.040> little<00:05:35.400> bit

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:35.610 
third thing would be add a little bit

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:38.810 
third thing would be add a little bit
more<00:05:36.410> interval<00:05:37.410> training<00:05:37.979> into<00:05:38.250> your<00:05:38.370> cardio
