side that way when the fish goes to pick

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.030 
side that way when the fish goes to pick
it<00:00:47.879> up<00:00:47.970> it<00:00:48.900> has<00:00:49.080> all<00:00:49.410> the<00:00:49.559> weight<00:00:49.739> right<00:00:50.010> there

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:50.040 
it up it has all the weight right there

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.869 
it up it has all the weight right there
and<00:00:51.860> more<00:00:52.860> times<00:00:53.129> than<00:00:53.339> not<00:00:53.489> you're<00:00:53.730> going<00:00:53.820> to

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
and more times than not you're going to

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.570 
and more times than not you're going to
have<00:00:54.089> a<00:00:54.120> running<00:00:55.050> fish<00:00:55.440> with<00:00:55.650> it<00:00:55.830> so<00:00:56.370> I'm<00:00:56.430> going

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:56.580

have the lid clip system l using a

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.210 
have the lid clip system l using a
different<00:01:04.379> type<00:01:04.530> of<00:01:04.559> light<00:01:04.830> and<00:01:05.070> this<00:01:05.159> is

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
different type of light and this is

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.370 
different type of light and this is
going<00:01:05.489> to<00:01:05.550> be<00:01:05.610> in<00:01:05.790> line<00:01:06.000> and<00:01:06.900> I'll<00:01:07.110> show<00:01:07.320> you

next thing in line lead we're just going
to<00:02:20.900> thread<00:02:21.140> that<00:02:21.260> through<00:02:21.590> as<00:02:21.680> well

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.520 

the<00:02:32.400> purpose<00:02:32.760> of<00:02:32.819> the<00:02:32.940> tail<00:02:33.150> rubber<00:02:33.390> is<00:02:33.720> just

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
the purpose of the tail rubber is just

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.800 
the purpose of the tail rubber is just
to<00:02:34.650> protect<00:02:35.040> that<00:02:35.220> protect<00:02:35.819> that<00:02:36.000> plastic<00:02:36.599> as

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
to protect that protect that plastic as

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:38.960 
to protect that protect that plastic as
you<00:02:37.530> ruin<00:02:37.890> it's<00:02:38.099> going<00:02:38.220> to<00:02:38.280> beat<00:02:38.519> it<00:02:38.640> up<00:02:38.760> pretty

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
you ruin it's going to beat it up pretty

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:39.729 
you ruin it's going to beat it up pretty
bad

00:02:39.729 --> 00:02:39.739 
bad

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:51.309 
bad
so<00:02:40.739> that<00:02:41.159> just<00:02:41.370> slides<00:02:41.549> over<00:02:41.849> like<00:02:42.150> that

00:02:51.309 --> 00:02:51.319 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:53.289 

that<00:02:52.040> way<00:02:52.189> when<00:02:52.370> you<00:02:52.489> wrote<00:02:52.700> in<00:02:52.879> it's<00:02:53.060> going<00:02:53.180> to

00:02:53.289 --> 00:02:53.299 
that way when you wrote in it's going to

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:55.270 
that way when you wrote in it's going to
protect<00:02:53.420> it's<00:02:53.930> cheaper<00:02:54.319> to<00:02:54.349> replace<00:02:54.859> a<00:02:54.890> teller

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
protect it's cheaper to replace a teller

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.489 
protect it's cheaper to replace a teller
over<00:02:55.549> that<00:02:55.730> is<00:02:55.939> the<00:02:56.120> lead<00:02:56.269> insert<00:02:56.659> so<00:02:57.379> that's

00:02:57.489 --> 00:02:57.499 
over that is the lead insert so that's

00:02:57.499 --> 00:02:59.890 
over that is the lead insert so that's
why<00:02:57.680> I<00:02:57.739> do<00:02:57.829> that<00:02:58.129> so<00:02:59.030> I'll<00:02:59.269> stop<00:02:59.510> right<00:02:59.719> there

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
why I do that so I'll stop right there

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:01.509 
why I do that so I'll stop right there
and<00:03:00.049> I'll<00:03:00.109> take<00:03:00.230> a<00:03:00.290> photo<00:03:00.590> just<00:03:01.249> so<00:03:01.340> you<00:03:01.400> can

00:03:01.509 --> 00:03:01.519 
and I'll take a photo just so you can

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:06.369 
and I'll take a photo just so you can
see<00:03:01.819> okay<00:03:02.810> next<00:03:03.109> up<00:03:03.349> I'm<00:03:03.680> going<00:03:03.950> to<00:03:04.040> do<00:03:04.249> is<00:03:04.780> a<00:03:05.780> I

00:03:06.369 --> 00:03:06.379 
see okay next up I'm going to do is a I

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:08.949 
see okay next up I'm going to do is a I
already<00:03:06.739> have<00:03:06.889> this<00:03:07.069> clipped<00:03:07.819> on<00:03:08.030> up<00:03:08.359> my<00:03:08.510> flexi

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:08.959 
already have this clipped on up my flexi

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:11.470 
already have this clipped on up my flexi
swivel<00:03:09.409> and<00:03:09.639> quick-change<00:03:10.639> swivel<00:03:11.150> together

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.480 
swivel and quick-change swivel together

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:14.050 
swivel and quick-change swivel together
that's<00:03:12.439> usually<00:03:12.829> my<00:03:13.010> standard<00:03:13.489> practice

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:14.060 
that's usually my standard practice

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:15.910 
that's usually my standard practice
because<00:03:14.329> it<00:03:14.480> makes<00:03:14.659> it<00:03:14.840> bricht<00:03:15.109> changing<00:03:15.829> a

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:15.920 
because it makes it bricht changing a

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:18.580 
because it makes it bricht changing a
lot<00:03:16.040> simpler<00:03:16.870> again<00:03:17.870> I'm<00:03:18.049> just<00:03:18.169> going<00:03:18.379> to<00:03:18.439> do<00:03:18.560> a

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 
lot simpler again I'm just going to do a

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:19.270 
lot simpler again I'm just going to do a
real<00:03:18.889> quick

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:19.280 
real quick

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:23.289 
real quick
not<00:03:19.819> just<00:03:20.810> that<00:03:20.959> holds<00:03:21.260> together<00:03:21.530> and<00:03:22.120> I'm<00:03:23.120> not

00:03:23.289 --> 00:03:23.299 
not just that holds together and I'm not

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:27.369 
not just that holds together and I'm not
going<00:03:23.540> to<00:03:23.889> put<00:03:24.889> any<00:03:25.069> spit<00:03:25.400> or<00:03:25.519> water<00:03:25.760> on<00:03:25.969> it<00:03:26.379> as

00:03:27.369 --> 00:03:27.379 
going to put any spit or water on it as

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:31.110 
going to put any spit or water on it as
well<00:03:28.250> usually<00:03:29.239> I<00:03:29.480> always<00:03:29.510> do<00:03:29.959> that<00:03:30.139> that<00:03:30.379> way

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.120 
well usually I always do that that way

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:36.939 
well usually I always do that that way
less<00:03:32.120> chance<00:03:32.480> of<00:03:32.599> it<00:03:32.719> breaking<00:03:35.709> just<00:03:36.709> do<00:03:36.919> a

00:03:36.939 --> 00:03:36.949 
less chance of it breaking just do a

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:41.530 
less chance of it breaking just do a
quick<00:03:37.340> not<00:03:37.579> here<00:03:38.560> just<00:03:39.560> to<00:03:39.859> represent<00:03:40.849> again

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:41.540 
quick not here just to represent again

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:44.709 
quick not here just to represent again
then<00:03:42.230> put<00:03:42.439> any<00:03:42.669> water<00:03:43.669> anything<00:03:44.030> on<00:03:44.299> there<00:03:44.510> I

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:44.719 
then put any water anything on there I

00:03:44.719 --> 00:03:49.390 
then put any water anything on there I
always<00:03:45.290> do<00:03:45.439> that<00:03:45.590> with<00:03:45.739> my<00:03:46.010> knots<00:03:48.189> always<00:03:49.189> want

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:49.400 
always do that with my knots always want

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.250 
always do that with my knots always want
to<00:03:49.459> wet<00:03:49.609> that<00:03:49.790> down<00:03:50.090> just<00:03:50.449> so<00:03:50.840> you<00:03:50.930> know<00:03:51.079> it's

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:51.260 
to wet that down just so you know it's

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.610 
to wet that down just so you know it's
going<00:03:51.409> to<00:03:51.500> cinch<00:03:51.799> better<00:03:53.109> okay<00:03:54.109> so<00:03:54.139> basically

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:54.620 
going to cinch better okay so basically

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:57.189 
going to cinch better okay so basically
at<00:03:54.949> this<00:03:55.069> point<00:03:55.329> we<00:03:56.329> have<00:03:56.479> our<00:03:56.509> swivel<00:03:57.109> in

00:03:58.839 --> 00:03:58.849 
front of it all we're going to do is pop

00:03:58.849 --> 00:04:07.820 
front of it all we're going to do is pop
it<00:03:59.000> into<00:03:59.150> the<00:03:59.329> lid

that's going to do is protect it that
way<00:04:59.750> I<00:04:59.780> know<00:04:59.960> the<00:05:00.110> knots<00:05:00.320> not<00:05:00.590> going<00:05:00.800> to<00:05:00.860> slip

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:02.020 
way I know the knots not going to slip

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:06.190 
way I know the knots not going to slip
and<00:05:03.020> adjust<00:05:03.440> my<00:05:03.620> lid<00:05:03.830> here<00:05:04.780> it's<00:05:05.780> a<00:05:05.870> tail

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:06.200 
and adjust my lid here it's a tail

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:11.170 
and adjust my lid here it's a tail
rubber<00:05:06.820> inline<00:05:07.820> lead<00:05:08.150> it's<00:05:09.110> a<00:05:09.970> flexi<00:05:10.970> ring

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:11.180 
rubber inline lead it's a flexi ring

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:13.300 
rubber inline lead it's a flexi ring
swivel<00:05:11.480> which<00:05:12.440> is<00:05:12.650> attached<00:05:13.040> to<00:05:13.190> a

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:13.310 
swivel which is attached to a

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:16.659 
swivel which is attached to a
quick-change<00:05:13.730> swivel<00:05:14.419> piece<00:05:15.380> of<00:05:15.530> tubing<00:05:15.950> then

00:05:16.659 --> 00:05:16.669 
quick-change swivel piece of tubing then

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:19.120 
quick-change swivel piece of tubing then
I<00:05:16.700> have<00:05:16.910> my<00:05:17.060> hair<00:05:17.240> rig<00:05:17.450> and<00:05:17.800> we're<00:05:18.800> good<00:05:18.980> to<00:05:19.100> go

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:19.130 
I have my hair rig and we're good to go

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:21.310 
I have my hair rig and we're good to go
so<00:05:19.490> basically<00:05:20.060> this<00:05:20.419> works<00:05:20.660> just<00:05:20.930> like<00:05:21.169> my

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:21.320 
so basically this works just like my

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:23.830 
so basically this works just like my
lead<00:05:21.500> clip<00:05:21.770> system<00:05:22.220> this<00:05:22.970> is<00:05:23.150> going<00:05:23.300> to<00:05:23.360> cast<00:05:23.660> a

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:23.840 
lead clip system this is going to cast a

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:26.020 
lead clip system this is going to cast a
lot<00:05:23.960> easier<00:05:24.320> because<00:05:24.470> it<00:05:24.800> is<00:05:24.919> inline<00:05:25.340> you<00:05:25.820> want

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:26.030 
lot easier because it is inline you want

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:28.780 
lot easier because it is inline you want
to<00:05:26.090> put<00:05:26.210> a<00:05:26.240> pack<00:05:26.480> bait<00:05:26.750> around<00:05:26.870> it<00:05:27.290> method<00:05:27.860> or

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:28.790 
to put a pack bait around it method or

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:32.200 
to put a pack bait around it method or
ground<00:05:29.150> break<00:05:29.450> ground<00:05:29.960> bait<00:05:30.880> makes<00:05:31.880> a<00:05:32.000> lot

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:32.210 
ground break ground bait makes a lot

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:34.090 
ground break ground bait makes a lot
easier<00:05:32.570> flying<00:05:32.960> in<00:05:33.110> line<00:05:33.320> it's<00:05:33.530> also<00:05:33.710> easier

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:34.100 
easier flying in line it's also easier

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:36.220 
easier flying in line it's also easier
to<00:05:34.190> pack<00:05:34.370> round<00:05:34.730> in<00:05:34.940> line<00:05:35.120> so<00:05:35.840> it's<00:05:36.020> happening

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:36.230 
to pack round in line so it's happening

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:38.170 
to pack round in line so it's happening
just<00:05:36.620> like<00:05:36.770> Mother<00:05:37.010> video<00:05:37.310> car<00:05:37.700> comes<00:05:37.940> along

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:38.180 
just like Mother video car comes along

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:41.080 
just like Mother video car comes along
you<00:05:38.750> guys<00:05:38.840> a<00:05:38.930> suck<00:05:39.260> it<00:05:39.440> in<00:05:39.560> guys<00:05:40.370> a<00:05:40.400> lift<00:05:40.700> up<00:05:40.910> on

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:41.090 
you guys a suck it in guys a lift up on

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:44.140 
you guys a suck it in guys a lift up on
it<00:05:41.890> your<00:05:42.890> hook<00:05:43.130> just<00:05:43.310> flipped<00:05:43.610> around<00:05:43.760> and

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:44.150 
it your hook just flipped around and

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:46.180 
it your hook just flipped around and
soon<00:05:45.020> as<00:05:45.110> it<00:05:45.200> fills<00:05:45.500> out<00:05:45.680> it's<00:05:45.830> going<00:05:45.950> to<00:05:46.040> go

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:46.190 
soon as it fills out it's going to go

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:48.850 
soon as it fills out it's going to go
try<00:05:46.460> to<00:05:46.550> get<00:05:46.880> away<00:05:47.230> this<00:05:48.230> is<00:05:48.410> a<00:05:48.440> three<00:05:48.740> and<00:05:48.800> a

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:48.860 
try to get away this is a three and a

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:50.320 
try to get away this is a three and a
half<00:05:49.010> ounce<00:05:49.250> let<00:05:49.520> it<00:05:49.700> look<00:05:49.880> doesn't<00:05:50.090> look<00:05:50.300> that

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:50.330 
half ounce let it look doesn't look that

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:53.590 
half ounce let it look doesn't look that
big<00:05:50.660> but<00:05:51.020> it's<00:05:51.200> a<00:05:51.310> real<00:05:52.310> dense<00:05:52.580> and<00:05:52.850> because

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:53.600 
big but it's a real dense and because

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:56.409 
big but it's a real dense and because
all<00:05:54.050> the<00:05:54.290> weights<00:05:54.500> on<00:05:54.770> one<00:05:55.040> side<00:05:55.370> it's<00:05:56.180> going

00:05:56.409 --> 00:05:56.419 
all the weights on one side it's going

00:05:56.419 --> 00:05:58.810 
all the weights on one side it's going
to<00:05:56.480> set<00:05:56.720> the<00:05:56.870> hook<00:05:56.990> instantly<00:05:57.620> so<00:05:58.580> that

00:05:58.810 --> 00:05:58.820 
to set the hook instantly so that

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:00.520 
to set the hook instantly so that
actually<00:05:59.180> went<00:05:59.330> into<00:05:59.630> my<00:05:59.750> hand<00:06:00.020> a<00:06:00.110> little<00:06:00.140> bit

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:00.530 
actually went into my hand a little bit

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:03.460 
actually went into my hand a little bit
what<00:06:00.890> you<00:06:00.980> don't<00:06:01.160> want<00:06:01.310> that<00:06:01.720> but<00:06:02.720> I<00:06:02.780> got<00:06:03.440> to

a screaming fish and then a lot of

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:13.300 
a screaming fish and then a lot of
people<00:06:11.960> say<00:06:12.200> these<00:06:12.410> are<00:06:12.560> not<00:06:12.710> safe<00:06:13.070> because

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:13.310 
people say these are not safe because

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:15.340 
people say these are not safe because
they<00:06:13.610> don't<00:06:13.790> come<00:06:13.970> off<00:06:14.000> I<00:06:14.450> beg<00:06:14.690> to<00:06:14.720> differ

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:15.350 
they don't come off I beg to differ

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:17.710 
they don't come off I beg to differ
your<00:06:15.800> line<00:06:15.980> breaks<00:06:16.340> that<00:06:17.120> just<00:06:17.360> popped<00:06:17.570> right

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:17.720 
your line breaks that just popped right

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:21.640 
your line breaks that just popped right
off<00:06:17.979> so<00:06:18.979> that<00:06:19.370> is<00:06:19.580> safe<00:06:19.850> for<00:06:19.880> the<00:06:20.180> fish<00:06:20.650> your

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:21.650 
off so that is safe for the fish your

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:23.050 
off so that is safe for the fish your
main<00:06:21.830> line<00:06:22.039> breaks<00:06:22.340> that's<00:06:22.610> going<00:06:22.760> to<00:06:22.820> slide

main line breaks that's going to slide
right<00:06:23.300> off<00:06:23.330> and
