00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.040
 we have developed a method of 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.480
 complex surface treatment that we 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.820
 allows to obtain distances of 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.460
 braking that are half of 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:23.160
 Braking distances of carbon wheels 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:26.279
 current all its processes developed for 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.109
 get a high- performing rim have 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.390
 took a lot of time we put in 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.520
 about more than three years with a 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.899
 full developer team of 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.149
 major difficulty in the realization 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:39.120
 of a carbon-fiber leg the first 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.920
 it's the resistance of the profile to the 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.600
 diplomatic pressure and the second 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.370
 it's the resistance of the profile to the 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.899
 heat that releases the braking a 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.700
 aluminum rims is able to 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.320
 dissipate the heat quite quickly and 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.399
 aluminum itself resists 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.140
 very high temperatures 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.820
 this is not the case for carbon and 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.070
 including the resin that compose it 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.480
 since it will not withstand as much 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.190
 heat and will tend to get 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.930
 soften and caused the break in 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.489
 profile our goal initially was 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.799
 already detect all modes of 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.720
 possible failure of the wheel of 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.119
 highlight and then by 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.070
 through very thorough tests to arrive 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.810
 to find the technical solutions that 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.369
 solve these problems and 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.150
 the solutions we implemented 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.430
 are very unique 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.479
 it's the wedding of an inserts in 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.640
 aluminum that is in every way 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.619
 different from a rim and who himself 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.820
 is very light from our mastery 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.700
 perfect technologies related to 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:30.119
 machining aluminum and a setting 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:32.070
 shape with that the carbon itself has some 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:33.659
 very special properties one associates 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.549
 several different types of resin 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.840
 we then submit to treatments 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.490
 thermally according to a very protocol 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:42.270
 accurate which is subject to secrecy this 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.770
 resin assembly and this post this post 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.869
 treatment that allows the resin 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.670
 to reach very high temperatures 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:49.619
 elevated therefore allows him to resist 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.020
 big braking constraints and 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:54.899
 cosmic carbon 40 with tires is 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:58.979
 consisting of different elements in 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:02:01.320
 first an aluminum hoop that 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:05.549
 guarantees good impact resistance 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:08.009
 and easy mounting of the tire then a 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:10.730
 man a core made of a material 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:14.420
 extremely light and very resistant 

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:16.950
 is also very resistant to temperature 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:20.670
 then a number of layers of 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:22.860
 carbon reinforcements that are 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:26.000
 positioned on the rim manually 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:29.000
 to ensure accuracy 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.230
 orientation of carbon fibers for 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.470
 to get a leg that resists 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:35.160
 perfectly to the constraints during his 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.690
 use 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.340
 these operations are a fake 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:40.739
 manual today between each 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.840
 operation we have a control for 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:45.000
 make sure of the correct positioning 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.370
 guarantees reliability of the rim 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.760
 the following the agent prior to 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:53.400
 rapper and position in this mold 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:56.220
 semolina will go on under the press and 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:58.580
 will undergo a cooking cycle with a 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:00.360
 high temperature high pressure 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:02.310
 who will give all his 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:04.409
 mechanical characteristics at the rim 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:08.080
 here is the leg that came out of the mold 

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:11.770
 on which we came breakthrough 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:14.260
 the ray fixings so this process 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:15.880
 allows to pierce from the inside one 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:19.270
 just pierce one serves the ucl we saw 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:22.210
 just now to draping it avoids us 

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:23.770
 to pierce the front of rims so we 

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:26.020
 gets a leg that is a lot more 

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:28.980
 resistant since we did not deteriorate 

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:28.980
 the bottom of legs by holes 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:38.859
 we did tests that are really 

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:39.969
 extreme really to guarantee a 

00:03:38.859 --> 00:03:42.400
 mechanical resistance of the road 

00:03:39.969 --> 00:03:44.340
 cosmic carbon 40 so in the 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.900
 dry dynamic braking conditions 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:48.700
 let's turn our or turn to 60 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:51.069
 kilometers / hour an affectionate one 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:52.599
 emergency braking on a certain 

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:55.209
 distance that is estimated relative to 

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:56.799
 field results that give us 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:59.290
 output braking temperatures 

00:03:56.799 --> 00:04:02.319
 of crabbing does not go 200 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:03.350
 degrees and dynamic braking with the 

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:05.990
 tests of 

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:07.870
 thermal camera one realizes that a 

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:10.620
 instant the temperature is very high 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:11.819
 but this has no 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:13.950
 no results on the resistance 

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:15.690
 wheel mechanics and heat and 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:17.729
 spreading all the wheel so there will be 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:19.079
 always optimal braking for the 

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:21.090
 practicing in all conditions 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:24.169
 be provisionally dry conditions 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:24.169
 united braking 

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:30.000
 we have here above all to finalize our 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.860
 field tests that we have a base of 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.940
 important data 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:34.410
 it is a reference site in the middle 

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:35.510
 on which we can put 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:37.550
 constraint 

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:39.500
 the wheel in all its all 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:41.510
 configuration the protocol of the is 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:43.640
 was formed to conduct 

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:46.940
 downhill pass at a certain speed 

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:49.220
 with a certain weight defined by our 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:50.900
 engineers in order to restore the maximum 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:52.310
 braking energy measures l 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:53.750
 warming up with pellets 

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:55.070
 temperature inside the rim 

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:57.530
 that give us important data 

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:59.840
 in reliability so since we 

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:01.910
 started the project we could use 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:04.070
 a hundred lords with 

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:05.690
 different profiles because the importance of 

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:08.150
 braking of each individual was taken 

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:09.860
 into consideration in the phenomenon of 

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:12.710
 braking and warm-up rim 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:15.170
 which ensures that the cosmic 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:16.340
 carbon 40 is vastly better than 

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:19.150
 its competitors in terms of reliability 

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:21.320
 in particular it is the exhaustive test 

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:24.650
 laboratory but especially land that we have 

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:26.240
 set up for the db and to check 

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:29.290
 that they were able to resist 

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:29.290
 very important constraints
