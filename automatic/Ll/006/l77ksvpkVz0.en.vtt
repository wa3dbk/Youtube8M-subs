00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:01.890 
too old workstations now we have into

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:04.070 
too old workstations now we have into
running<00:00:02.100> workstation<00:00:02.909> and<00:00:03.090> we've<00:00:03.720> connected

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:04.080 
running workstation and we've connected

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.860 
running workstation and we've connected
that<00:00:04.529> over<00:00:05.370> here<00:00:05.580> to<00:00:05.819> a<00:00:06.060> couple<00:00:06.450> of<00:00:06.540> different

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:06.870 
that over here to a couple of different

that over here to a couple of different
devices<00:00:07.170> we're<00:00:07.830> going<00:00:07.980> to<00:00:08.069> show<00:00:08.189> the

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
devices we're going to show the

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:10.669 
devices we're going to show the
capabilities<00:00:08.940> of<00:00:08.970> a<00:00:09.210> light<00:00:09.570> peak<00:00:09.870> and<00:00:10.139> at<00:00:10.530> what

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
capabilities of a light peak and at what

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.390 
capabilities of a light peak and at what
man<00:00:10.860> way<00:00:11.040> that<00:00:11.219> can<00:00:11.400> run<00:00:11.780> so<00:00:12.780> we<00:00:13.410> certainly

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
man way that can run so we certainly

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.039 
man way that can run so we certainly
want<00:00:14.610> to<00:00:14.670> get<00:00:14.820> the<00:00:14.940> demo<00:00:15.120> underweight<00:00:15.929> and

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
want to get the demo underweight and

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.410 
want to get the demo underweight and
then<00:00:16.199> I'll<00:00:16.320> describe<00:00:16.650> it<00:00:17.010> and<00:00:17.220> power<00:00:17.550> what<00:00:18.300> we

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
then I'll describe it and power what we

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.630 
then I'll describe it and power what we
have<00:00:18.630> here<00:00:18.660> is<00:00:18.930> actually<00:00:19.529> the<00:00:19.710> light<00:00:19.890> be<00:00:20.130> table

gigabits each way mm-hmm and what we're

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.660 
gigabits each way mm-hmm and what we're
doing<00:01:04.049> is<00:01:04.350> we're<00:01:04.559> routing<00:01:04.860> multiple

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
doing is we're routing multiple
