00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.570
 I'll show you how to get out of everything today 

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:16.230
 Bamboo directed it is such a document 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:25.949
 for the table a cosmetic brush 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:30.869
 container tinkering that I show you 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:33.829
 now I do not use it anymore 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:36.120
 my table I have you once the 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:38.640
 the front of it is not something green and 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.250
 if it is a little brighter the light for 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:44.010
 inside then you need about 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:47.399
 one and a half meters long, they loop 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:54.270
 even what color and found down here 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:59.270
 so here could be a middle the 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:01:07.760
 loop tape from top to bottom 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:11.460
 once through then this end here 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:13.680
 I will stick with a hot glue 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.830
 once I'm doing a little kink here 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:20.189
 inside man means rather I have here 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:22.909
 already finished the and glue the piece 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:29.840
 one not here about afterwards 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:29.840
 slip off so stick to it 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:41.730
 and then we start here and that too 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:44.350
 grind 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:47.190
 Here we have the opening here 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:47.190
 go through here 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:57.360
 you can measure your brush like 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:57.360
 wide they are heavy 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:08.729
 and also after that the distances 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:12.940
 do so from the bottom so from the back 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:23.610
 loop tape just a skip one 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:23.610
 Bamboo skip ahead 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:37.060
 now you have a holder here 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:39.820
 then it continues until the end pulls 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:42.150
 her the ribbon once through this 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:48.820
 whole sake from above 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:52.590
 12 34 over 123 so a bamboo stick 

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:55.590
 skip from front to back 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:55.590
 move out 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:14.130
 and then from below again a bamboo 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:19.310
 skip and from below can still one 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:22.370
 Pull apart a bit and down 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:22.370
 up 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:54.840
 I'll show you I have one here 

00:03:45.600 --> 00:04:10.830
 kibble sees this here in the 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:04:14.550
 rivers interspaces to the brush 

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:19.460
 These are loose and here again 

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:19.460
 firmly give the whole well 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:36.450
 and could it be the beautiful band 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:44.990
 once wrap around here once 

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:44.990
 pull through and make a loop 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:57.300
 and the case for the island is ready 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:57.300
 for the cosmetics
