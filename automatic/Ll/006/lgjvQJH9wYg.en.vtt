00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:09.599
 hi everyone so new video 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.670
 today it was absolutely not planned 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.620
 than this video but I think it's 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.480
 really important that I do it in 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.670
 there are some who can be 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.920
 see on instagram on facebook i get 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.439
 got scammed I got the 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.539
 counterfeit for two close to the mac 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.730
 and I absolutely wanted to talk to you about it 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:30.000
 to help you recognize a 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.769
 counterfeit and you do not fall 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.090
 in the trap like me so here I am 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.010
 will try to get me back but 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.890
 I do not know it can be done anyway 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:40.050
 I am very disappointed and here I wanted 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.899
 you talk about it so it all started on 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.399
 the site vintage point fr it is a 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.340
 application for iphone we can sell 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.690
 his clothes swap them and I 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.860
 were looking for mac products because 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.809
 I have no mac in my city suddenly 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:55.559
 here I wanted I wanted to have 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:57.480
 lighthouses to test so I have all 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.969
 received this morning in a little letter 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:03.239
 mini max like that short this is all 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:06.570
 that she simpler fast sending very 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:09.180
 very good at seeing so I look at them 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.729
 colors and I found really low not 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.750
 badly what so I wanted to show I you 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:20.280
 do not say the names so here is a purple 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:23.939
 golden and a blue so I found them 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:26.909
 really one so far box by 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:30.119
 example of blue and that's me I say it's 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:32.670
 weird it's falling so low finally threw so 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:35.790
 you see that it moves like that 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:38.130
 and it's really cheap the package I 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.970
 I mean plastic seems to me 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:43.500
 really hungry even when we do it 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:45.420
 it's stupid but it's not at all 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:49.860
 such a true heart so that's a real 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:51.210
 from mac and I do not know at last there is 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.250
 really a difference I finally find 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.860
 after that it may be subjective that and 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.960
 in any case the packaging already has me 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.259
 seemed rather weird but it's not the 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.070
 more the most serious 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:04.890
 so I'm going to take pictures 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.240
 surely between what I say because 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.130
 I do not have the macro and it's going to be pretty 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:11.980
 complicated for you to see but 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:16.450
 so that 's the one of that one 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:20.740
 is called chrome wholesale thousand of lots not 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:21.640
 chrome yellow is the true the true 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:27.840
 lighthouse at mac 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:30.730
 so I will put a picture of the true and 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.590
 so I have to put a picture of 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:34.740
 fake right next so you can 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.740
 see 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:44.420
 and above all, it's the back 

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:46.430
 finally who really me it's no it's 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:48.470
 not a real one actually is not marked chrome 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:51.220
 yellow media markt and body mme diallo 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:53.450
 so it's h on the 1st 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:55.599
 Here it does not mean that it chromium 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:59.150
 means horns 

00:02:55.599 --> 00:03:01.010
 also there is no so that already 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:04.010
 it was for this one but what is 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:05.510
 even more more worrying it's 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:07.129
 that there is no finite name that's to 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:10.069
 say for example this one this is the 

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:12.860
 tempting of gmac I love you see 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:16.220
 yahia and that illustrates so that means 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:17.630
 that you know you surely know that 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:21.500
 chandeliers at mac that means it 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:24.140
 shine all that but on that one 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:26.090
 there is no sign is described in fact 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:29.120
 especially the nacs I received there are 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:32.299
 no finishes there are not marked matt chandeliers 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:34.760
 or then frost com on the taupe fir 

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:37.160
 there is absolutely nothing written so see 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:39.019
 it's only the name and again this 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:41.600
 is not stuck in the middle finally yes 

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:44.079
 it's really not neat it looks like a 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:44.079
 sticker 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:53.440
 and I'm really disappointed with that because 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:56.500
 I really wanted mac products 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:04:03.220
 and here I see that actually in the place of the 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:06.280
 finished there scored at 8 to 6 or three which 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:08.620
 is totally my beeps and I wanted 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:09.970
 to say also so that's the plumage at 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:11.560
 color level it's not at all 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:13.720
 that the real plumage is not at all 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:17.250
 this color I do not care so 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:17.250
 comparisons between the two 

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:25.390
 the plumage is a plus in a green 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:26.800
 duck blue duck that's it and that's it 

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:27.760
 really a simple blue level 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:29.830
 texture 

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:31.900
 I do not know I have not tested the 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:33.450
 pigmentation looks really good 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:36.550
 how late does it seem to go 

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:38.400
 although it looks pretty powdery in 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:43.080
 anyway it's not mac 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:43.080
 the star star and rocket 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:54.330
 not the same I find that the headlights are 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:55.830
 really powdery but the diet 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:57.930
 is good so after I do not know I 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:00.060
 did not lose everything but what makes me 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:02.550
 more laughing is the body even cambiaso 

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:08.130
 beware it's not chrome it's supposed 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:10.500
 to be golden is true like yellow 

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:13.590
 cros mayall with forgiveness is a yellow so 

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:15.480
 So here at the swatch level it's 

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:17.310
 really ugly that's really the one who 

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:20.520
 disappoints me the most 

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:23.040
 so here I am really very disappointed 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:24.630
 his headlights so really really does 

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:26.460
 watch especially the back 

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:28.950
 when you want to order mak 

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:30.540
 finally look ask the seller of 

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:34.200
 take a picture of the bottom and if you 

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:36.320
 do not see the frosst rendering I have more than 

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:38.340
 I said just now 

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:39.390
 really it's really not real 

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:41.190
 look at the difference 

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:44.130
 yes there really a difference it 

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:46.170
 it's a real mac and that's the 

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:49.590
 counterfeits finally that's it really got me 

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:51.210
 angry on the mad so here I wanted 

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:53.070
 absolutely you talked about it mostly made 

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:54.380
 really very very careful i think 

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:57.570
 that the photos talk about it itself 

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:59.130
 but really pay attention to that 

00:05:57.570 --> 00:06:00.540
 you see on the internet and really does 

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:02.970
 pay attention especially when you buy on 

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:04.140
 sites because here I tried to 

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:05.940
 get paid back it's going to be pretty 

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:07.470
 complicated I will try to have some 

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:10.620
 evidence to tell him that it's fake 

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:12.150
 and that's so I hope maybe 

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:14.250
 that she will see this video I do not know 

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:16.080
 anyway i'm really disappointed i 

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:20.420
 really thought it was real 

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:20.420
 pharmacist so that's just being careful
