let's see what else is in here let's
talk<00:02:16.489> about<00:02:16.670> the<00:02:16.819> crystals

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:21.790 

we<00:02:20.480> all<00:02:20.600> love<00:02:20.810> the<00:02:20.960> crystals<00:02:21.380> right<00:02:21.530> I'm

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800 
we all love the crystals right I'm

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.670 
we all love the crystals right I'm
pretty<00:02:22.070> sure<00:02:22.310> one<00:02:22.490> of<00:02:22.610> these<00:02:22.730> three<00:02:23.650> one<00:02:24.650> of

pretty sure one of these three one of
these<00:02:24.860> three<00:02:25.280> characters<00:02:25.790> coming<00:02:26.150> soon

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
these three characters coming soon

they have the profile picture and then
they<00:02:54.530> have<00:02:54.680> the<00:02:54.830> Warmachine<00:02:55.520> crystal<00:02:56.060> the

00:02:56.949 --> 00:02:56.959 
they have the Warmachine crystal the

00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:59.260 
they have the Warmachine crystal the

white suit Deadpool in the game which is
kind<00:03:17.000> of<00:03:17.030> strange<00:03:17.239> you<00:03:17.450> you<00:03:17.780> think<00:03:18.080> that

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.290 
kind of strange you you think that

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:21.310 
kind of strange you you think that
they'll<00:03:18.560> have<00:03:18.770> it<00:03:19.060> so<00:03:20.060> they<00:03:20.270> have<00:03:20.480> the<00:03:20.840> white

force and without the white Deadpool
they<00:03:24.320> have<00:03:24.410> the<00:03:24.530> profile<00:03:24.980> picture<00:03:25.280> they<00:03:25.549> also

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:25.700 
they have the profile picture they also

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:29.170 
they have the profile picture they also
have<00:03:26.060> the<00:03:27.160> picture<00:03:28.160> itself<00:03:28.610> but<00:03:28.850> there's<00:03:29.030> no

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:29.180 
have the picture itself but there's no

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:30.640 
have the picture itself but there's no
crystal<00:03:29.660> so<00:03:29.750> I'm<00:03:29.840> not<00:03:29.959> really<00:03:30.260> sure<00:03:30.350> what's

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.650 
crystal so I'm not really sure what's

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:33.250 
crystal so I'm not really sure what's
happening<00:03:30.739> there<00:03:31.690> one<00:03:32.690> of<00:03:32.720> the<00:03:32.870> biggest

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:33.260 
happening there one of the biggest

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.610 
happening there one of the biggest
things<00:03:33.500> that<00:03:33.890> is<00:03:34.489> added<00:03:35.090> into<00:03:35.360> the<00:03:35.660> new<00:03:35.870> update

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:36.620 
things that is added into the new update

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:39.910 
things that is added into the new update
is<00:03:36.650> actually<00:03:37.549> there<00:03:37.790> is<00:03:37.970> a<00:03:38.000> five<00:03:38.570> star<00:03:39.140> crystal

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:39.920 
is actually there is a five star crystal

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:42.250 
is actually there is a five star crystal
this<00:03:40.100> is<00:03:40.190> red<00:03:40.480> crystal<00:03:41.480> right<00:03:41.660> here<00:03:41.959> that<00:03:42.140> is

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:42.260 
this is red crystal right here that is

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.370 
this is red crystal right here that is
dark<00:03:42.890> red<00:03:43.190> is<00:03:43.400> Ruby<00:03:43.880> like<00:03:44.090> is<00:03:44.360> a<00:03:44.780> five<00:03:45.110> star

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:45.380 
dark red is Ruby like is a five star

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:48.400 
dark red is Ruby like is a five star
crystal<00:03:45.950> so<00:03:46.280> this<00:03:47.030> is<00:03:47.269> the<00:03:47.450> five<00:03:47.660> star<00:03:47.989> crystal

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:48.410 
crystal so this is the five star crystal

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:49.840 
crystal so this is the five star crystal
I<00:03:48.500> don't<00:03:48.650> know<00:03:48.739> what's<00:03:48.980> in<00:03:49.160> there<00:03:49.400> but<00:03:49.430> maybe

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:49.850 
I don't know what's in there but maybe

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:52.600 
I don't know what's in there but maybe
they're<00:03:50.150> gonna<00:03:50.299> just<00:03:50.720> add<00:03:51.350> another<00:03:51.769> star<00:03:52.190> onto

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:52.610 
they're gonna just add another star onto

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:54.610 
they're gonna just add another star onto
the<00:03:52.850> characters<00:03:53.510> that<00:03:53.660> we<00:03:53.780> already<00:03:53.930> have<00:03:54.290> and

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:54.620 
the characters that we already have and

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:57.130 
the characters that we already have and
then<00:03:54.709> that's<00:03:55.160> five<00:03:55.400> stars<00:03:55.840> let's<00:03:56.840> see<00:03:56.989> what

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:57.140 
then that's five stars let's see what

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.759 
then that's five stars let's see what
else<00:03:57.290> do<00:03:57.410> we<00:03:57.470> have

00:03:57.759 --> 00:03:57.769 
else do we have

00:03:57.769 --> 00:03:59.530 
else do we have
I<00:03:58.070> don't<00:03:58.610> think<00:03:58.820> there's<00:03:59.030> anything<00:03:59.239> else

00:03:59.530 --> 00:03:59.540 
I don't think there's anything else
