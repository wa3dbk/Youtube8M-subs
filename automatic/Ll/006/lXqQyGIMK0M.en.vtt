00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:07.140
 he is a real American macho 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:08.130
 he is full of energy and you can see it 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.110
 him too 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:13.170
 because of the statement is something for the 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:15.690
 others the jeep grand cherokee srt 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.330
 is extremely self-confident on his 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.810
 20 inches and says I'm the one 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.880
 fastest jeep ever 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:25.590
 while leaving the grand cherokee outside like 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.660
 play in the muscles 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.730
 on the 7 inch touchscreen are 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.050
 all performance data at any time 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.540
 retrievable 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:37.200
 the american giant spirit again with 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:41.670
 luxury still with the power of the 64 liter v8 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:46.680
 under the hood has 4 168 ps consumption 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:52.309
 according to the work 15 liters with up to 257 km h 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:54.989
 is it going ahead basic price 77 1900 euro 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:57.289
 they have the grand cherokee powerful 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:00.890
 crested under the hood and v8 with 

00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:03.480
 64 euro per and two real 6 philipp 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:06.780
 no marketing &amp; food like some 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:09.390
 other manufacturers 4 168 ps and one 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:12.720
 maximum torque of 624 newton meters 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.640
 the suction engine is typically late 4100 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.470
 turns and what does it do 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:20.240
 with this car that 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:23.300
 goes great forward in 5.1 seconds 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:26.990
 from zero to 100 this can be new vw golf 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:29.080
 exposed so there is a real place 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:31.370
 many the vehicle 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:33.230
 what else does the slt troupe have? 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:34.360
 made with the jeep course 

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:36.530
 according to the chassis modified 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:38.930
 adaptive damper thicker 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.880
 However, this has stabilizers 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:42.260
 as a result the car is pretty hard 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.670
 even now in auto mode you can tell 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.020
 already now is quite tight to the point 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:47.720
 if you are still here at the 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:50.000
 Rotary switch to sport or even track 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.870
 then it's going to be pretty baltic 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.850
 you have to like it 

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:54.260
 and frankly in a car as 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:58.670
 his jeep does this a bit 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:02:01.120
 miss the place of the grand cherokee srt 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:03.680
 Car for tough guys 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:04.880
 with such a big and heavy one 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.110
 fast car mobile turns up 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.030
 of course , the question is right about it 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:10.340
 the safety ordered is braking 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.710
 always big topic especially at suvs the 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:15.560
 slt variant has a brake system 

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:17.930
 the 24 tonne wagons in 37 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.850
 two meters from 100 km / h to a standstill 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.890
 bring that is a really good value 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:23.690
 the braking power remains constant 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:25.760
 but you have to say in the porsche cayenne 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:26.870
 it can cost even better 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.959
 but also a lot more sensitive 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:35.930
 money for the cayenne turbo with 500 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:37.879
 ps are at least 123,000 euros due 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:39.950
 the jeep grand cherokee is a great one 

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:41.900
 dare the engine itself is too 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:43.189
 Great to fit together 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:45.049
 somehow not really the engine 

00:02:43.189 --> 00:02:47.810
 actually goes into the full-grown 

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:49.579
 sports car and angel ok heard then there 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:51.040
 it also has a three liter v6 diesel 

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:53.719
 a lot of torque from the speed cellar 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:55.340
 and again with the 

00:02:53.719 --> 00:02:57.189
 eight-speed automatic that means he lets 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:00.200
 also drive reasonably efficiently 

00:02:57.189 --> 00:03:02.269
 Driving efficiently is not lost here 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:04.489
 12 9 liters we did not bring the 

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:05.840
 test consumption was 15 5 times completely 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:08.510
 honest are a longer one 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:10.250
 autobahnnetappen thus 180 driven yes there 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:13.159
 then there are already 22 liters 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:15.200
 and you really have to want that well who 

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:19.389
 a macho has to get into the house with 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.389
 to live with such consequences
