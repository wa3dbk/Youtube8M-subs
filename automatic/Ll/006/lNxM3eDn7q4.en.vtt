YouTube video today we're going to look
at<00:00:04.920> it<00:00:05.009> across<00:00:06.109> something<00:00:07.109> that<00:00:07.140> I<00:00:07.290> stumbled

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740 
at it across something that I stumbled

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.089 
at it across something that I stumbled
on<00:00:07.799> when<00:00:07.919> i<00:00:07.980> was<00:00:08.099> in<00:00:08.160> toys<00:00:08.370> r<00:00:08.519> us<00:00:10.099> basically

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
on when i was in toys r us basically

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:12.200 
on when i was in toys r us basically
only<00:00:11.250> hooked<00:00:11.429> up<00:00:11.519> them<00:00:11.700> because<00:00:11.910> there<00:00:12.120> are<00:00:12.179> a

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
only hooked up them because there are a

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.180 
only hooked up them because there are a
half<00:00:12.389> price<00:00:12.690> sale<00:00:12.929> which<00:00:13.380> really<00:00:13.889> drew<00:00:14.070> my

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
half price sale which really drew my

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.039 
half price sale which really drew my
attention<00:00:14.219> but<00:00:15.120> what<00:00:15.299> they<00:00:15.420> are<00:00:15.599> is<00:00:15.809> they're

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
attention but what they are is they're

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.090 
attention but what they are is they're
what's<00:00:16.980> called<00:00:17.039> snap<00:00:17.550> tight<00:00:18.170> model<00:00:19.170> kits<00:00:19.439> from

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
what's called snap tight model kits from

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.849 
what's called snap tight model kits from
the<00:00:20.279> Star<00:00:20.460> Wars<00:00:20.609> range<00:00:20.970> put<00:00:21.869> out<00:00:21.960> by<00:00:22.140> ravel<00:00:22.560> re

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
the Star Wars range put out by ravel re

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.509 
the Star Wars range put out by ravel re
ve<00:00:23.220> Double<00:00:23.850> L<00:00:24.710> so<00:00:25.710> basically<00:00:26.070> their<00:00:26.189> models

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
ve Double L so basically their models

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.150 
ve Double L so basically their models
they're<00:00:26.699> not<00:00:26.820> actually<00:00:26.970> like<00:00:27.240> hasbro<00:00:27.720> toys

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:28.160 
they're not actually like hasbro toys

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.460 
they're not actually like hasbro toys
but<00:00:29.160> i<00:00:29.449> think<00:00:30.449> they're<00:00:30.539> really<00:00:30.689> worth<00:00:30.810> having

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
but i think they're really worth having

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:32.840 
but i think they're really worth having
a<00:00:31.529> look<00:00:31.560> at<00:00:31.800> because<00:00:32.070> there's<00:00:32.369> a<00:00:32.430> safer<00:00:32.700> half

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
a look at because there's a safer half

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.810 
a look at because there's a safer half
price<00:00:33.469> they<00:00:34.469> really<00:00:34.680> are<00:00:34.800> spectacular<00:00:35.700> when

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
price they really are spectacular when

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.700 
price they really are spectacular when
you<00:00:35.910> add<00:00:36.000> them<00:00:36.149> to<00:00:36.360> your<00:00:36.390> collection<00:00:37.230> and<00:00:37.590> put

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
you add them to your collection and put

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.139 
you add them to your collection and put
them<00:00:37.800> on<00:00:37.860> the<00:00:37.950> shelf<00:00:38.160> with<00:00:38.280> the<00:00:38.309> others<00:00:38.550> they

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
them on the shelf with the others they

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:40.639 
them on the shelf with the others they
really<00:00:39.329> do<00:00:39.480> look<00:00:39.629> good<00:00:39.809> so<00:00:40.079> what<00:00:40.379> we<00:00:40.469> have<00:00:40.620> here

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
really do look good so what we have here

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.770 
really do look good so what we have here
is<00:00:41.129> an<00:00:42.090> eight<00:00:42.360> ER<00:00:42.390> t<00:00:44.120> as<00:00:45.120> you<00:00:45.270> can<00:00:45.360> see<00:00:45.539> they're

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
is an eight ER t as you can see they're

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.350 
is an eight ER t as you can see they're
basically<00:00:46.710> what<00:00:47.010> the<00:00:47.250> snap<00:00:47.550> type<00:00:47.820> means<00:00:48.120> it's

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
basically what the snap type means it's

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.700 
basically what the snap type means it's
it's<00:00:48.660> really<00:00:48.899> simple<00:00:49.110> there's<00:00:49.320> no<00:00:49.440> gluing

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
it's really simple there's no gluing

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.250 
it's really simple there's no gluing
there's<00:00:50.700> no<00:00:50.910> paint<00:00:51.660> you<00:00:51.780> have<00:00:51.899> to<00:00:51.989> paint<00:00:52.199> it

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
there's no paint you have to paint it

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.779 
there's no paint you have to paint it
all<00:00:52.440> comes<00:00:52.649> pre<00:00:52.860> painted<00:00:53.100> this<00:00:53.489> one<00:00:53.670> even

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
all comes pre painted this one even

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.549 
all comes pre painted this one even
comes<00:00:53.969> with<00:00:54.120> the<00:00:54.270> figure<00:00:54.539> you<00:00:54.750> basically<00:00:55.469> just

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
comes with the figure you basically just

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.830 
comes with the figure you basically just
have<00:00:55.800> to<00:00:56.010> follow<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:56.280> instructions<00:00:56.789> pop<00:00:57.690> out

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
have to follow the instructions pop out

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.150 
have to follow the instructions pop out
the<00:00:57.870> parts<00:00:58.289> and<00:00:58.469> then<00:00:58.559> just<00:00:58.739> snap<00:00:58.980> them

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
the parts and then just snap them

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.060 
the parts and then just snap them
together<00:00:59.250> so<00:01:00.149> that's<00:01:00.300> the<00:01:00.449> ATR<00:01:01.050> T<00:01:01.320> we<00:01:01.890> then

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
together so that's the ATR T we then

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.560 
together so that's the ATR T we then
have<00:01:02.280> the<00:01:02.550> what<00:01:02.879> everybody<00:01:03.180> knows<00:01:03.359> is<00:01:03.539> the

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
have the what everybody knows is the

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.060 
have the what everybody knows is the
landspeeder<00:01:05.210> from<00:01:06.210> Hough<00:01:06.710> so<00:01:07.710> you<00:01:07.799> can<00:01:07.920> see

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
landspeeder from Hough so you can see

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:14.120 
landspeeder from Hough so you can see
there<00:01:08.250> comes<00:01:08.549> with<00:01:09.140> the<00:01:10.140> two<00:01:11.210> pilots<00:01:13.010> gun<00:01:14.010> on

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
there comes with the two pilots gun on

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:19.990 
there comes with the two pilots gun on
the<00:01:14.250> back<00:01:14.930> there's<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:16.200> engines<00:01:17.299> underneath

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.000 
the back there's the engines underneath

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.510 
the back there's the engines underneath
so<00:01:21.000> really<00:01:21.689> is<00:01:21.840> quite<00:01:22.799> impressive<00:01:23.040> that<00:01:23.340> one

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
so really is quite impressive that one

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.230 
so really is quite impressive that one
this<00:01:24.270> one<00:01:24.479> here<00:01:24.689> is<00:01:24.720> the<00:01:24.869> droid<00:01:25.020> try<00:01:25.320> fighter

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:26.240 
this one here is the droid try fighter

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.580 
this one here is the droid try fighter
has<00:01:27.240> moving<00:01:27.600> parts<00:01:27.630> so<00:01:28.020> you<00:01:28.080> can<00:01:28.259> spin<00:01:28.500> the

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
has moving parts so you can spin the

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.910 
has moving parts so you can spin the
ball<00:01:28.680> around<00:01:29.060> and<00:01:30.060> can<00:01:30.299> rotate<00:01:30.920> whichever

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
ball around and can rotate whichever

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.280 
ball around and can rotate whichever
direction<00:01:32.310> you<00:01:32.340> like<00:01:32.579> has<00:01:33.420> missiles<00:01:33.930> on<00:01:34.200> the

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
direction you like has missiles on the

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.920 
direction you like has missiles on the
bottom<00:01:34.970> it<00:01:35.970> really<00:01:36.150> was<00:01:36.329> blown<00:01:36.509> away<00:01:36.659> with

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
bottom it really was blown away with

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.630 
bottom it really was blown away with
these<00:01:37.079> like<00:01:37.350> I'm<00:01:37.590> not<00:01:37.920> hugely<00:01:38.250> a<00:01:38.400> model

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
these like I'm not hugely a model

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:39.560 
these like I'm not hugely a model
builder<00:01:38.909> as<00:01:39.000> you<00:01:39.060> can<00:01:39.150> probably<00:01:39.299> tell<00:01:39.420> from

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
builder as you can probably tell from

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:40.910 
builder as you can probably tell from
the<00:01:39.750> size<00:01:39.930> of<00:01:40.049> my<00:01:40.110> fingers<00:01:40.439> I've<00:01:40.680> got<00:01:40.799> more

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
the size of my fingers I've got more

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.999 
the size of my fingers I've got more
mechanics<00:01:41.310> fingers<00:01:41.610> than<00:01:41.729> anything<00:01:42.649> so<00:01:43.649> feel

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
mechanics fingers than anything so feel

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.370 
mechanics fingers than anything so feel
a<00:01:44.040> little<00:01:44.220> bits<00:01:44.430> don't<00:01:44.640> really<00:01:44.820> do<00:01:44.939> it<00:01:44.970> for<00:01:45.060> me

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.380 
a little bits don't really do it for me

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:48.139 
a little bits don't really do it for me
but<00:01:46.380> when<00:01:46.920> you<00:01:47.009> get<00:01:47.130> these<00:01:47.310> things<00:01:47.549> they
