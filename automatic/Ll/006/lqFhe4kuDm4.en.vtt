 since 1980 the total number of overweight sierra people has copied children 

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:02.040
 obese have become twice as many as teenagers themselves 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:03.580

 however, every day one in four Americans goes to eat in a fast food restaurant 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.480
 but this passion for fast food and does not concern only the truth begins to 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:19.880
 become a global phenomenon 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.600

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:56.110
 a world where people only use the car to get married to having to change 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:57.650
