00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:03.280 
that I'm making is for my family of six
I<00:01:00.500> start<00:01:01.309> with<00:01:01.489> a<00:01:01.730> stick<00:01:02.300> of<00:01:02.480> butter<00:01:02.510> which<00:01:03.050> is

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:03.290 
I start with a stick of butter which is

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:06.370 
I start with a stick of butter which is
a<00:01:03.320> half<00:01:03.739> a<00:01:03.770> cup<00:01:03.860> I<00:01:04.160> believe<00:01:04.660> and<00:01:05.660> you<00:01:06.050> melt<00:01:06.259> that

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:06.380 
a half a cup I believe and you melt that

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.150 
a half a cup I believe and you melt that
down<00:01:07.930> so<00:01:08.930> once<00:01:09.080> you<00:01:09.200> get<00:01:09.350> to<00:01:09.530> this<00:01:09.649> point<00:01:09.950> where

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:10.160 
down so once you get to this point where

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:11.980 
down so once you get to this point where
it's<00:01:10.310> all<00:01:10.460> melted<00:01:10.880> you're<00:01:11.119> going<00:01:11.330> to<00:01:11.479> put<00:01:11.720> some

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:11.990 
it's all melted you're going to put some

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:19.800 
it's all melted you're going to put some
flour<00:01:12.320> in<00:01:12.649> there<00:01:17.950> they<00:01:18.950> don't<00:01:19.100> have<00:01:19.220> any

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:19.810 
flour in there they don't have any

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:23.020 
flour in there they don't have any
measured<00:01:20.810> amounts<00:01:21.320> you<00:01:22.039> just<00:01:22.250> go<00:01:22.460> until<00:01:22.670> it

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:23.030 
measured amounts you just go until it

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:26.290 
measured amounts you just go until it
has<00:01:23.330> the<00:01:23.360> consistency<00:01:23.720> of<00:01:24.380> cookie<00:01:24.800> dough<00:01:25.300> it's

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:26.300 
has the consistency of cookie dough it's

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:28.450 
has the consistency of cookie dough it's
going<00:01:26.539> to<00:01:26.780> be<00:01:26.990> over<00:01:27.289> the<00:01:27.619> heat<00:01:27.830> for<00:01:28.130> a<00:01:28.190> little

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:28.460 
going to be over the heat for a little

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:35.320 
going to be over the heat for a little
bit<00:01:31.090> we're<00:01:32.090> going<00:01:32.240> to<00:01:32.360> add<00:01:32.539> milk<00:01:33.670> and<00:01:34.670> once

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:35.330 
bit we're going to add milk and once

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:39.100 
bit we're going to add milk and once
again<00:01:35.630> I<00:01:35.659> don't<00:01:35.840> have<00:01:36.020> a<00:01:36.820> set<00:01:37.820> measurement<00:01:38.780> for

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:39.110 
again I don't have a set measurement for

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:42.640 
again I don't have a set measurement for
this<00:01:39.260> so<00:01:40.189> you<00:01:40.250> just<00:01:40.520> pour<00:01:40.909> in<00:01:41.180> how<00:01:42.049> much<00:01:42.260> milk

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:42.650 
this so you just pour in how much milk

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:48.399 
this so you just pour in how much milk
you<00:01:43.390> want<00:01:45.790> how<00:01:46.790> much<00:01:46.909> how<00:01:47.479> much<00:01:47.600> sauce<00:01:48.110> you

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:52.369 
want or how thick you want it so we stir

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:56.080 
want or how thick you want it so we stir
that<00:01:52.580> in<00:01:52.790> and<00:01:53.619> we're<00:01:54.619> going<00:01:54.860> to<00:01:55.100> keep<00:01:55.640> it<00:01:55.880> like

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090 
that in and we're going to keep it like

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:01.380 
that in and we're going to keep it like
that<00:01:56.140> until<00:01:57.140> it's<00:01:57.470> at<00:01:57.650> its<00:01:57.830> boiling<00:01:58.310> point<00:01:59.710> and

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:01.390 
that until it's at its boiling point and

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:06.100 
that until it's at its boiling point and
the<00:02:02.390> sauce<00:02:02.780> will<00:02:03.110> thicken<00:02:03.140> as<00:02:04.030> it<00:02:05.030> starts<00:02:05.840> to

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.110 
the sauce will thicken as it starts to

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:11.020 
the sauce will thicken as it starts to
cook<00:02:06.320> so<00:02:07.009> feel<00:02:07.939> free<00:02:08.000> to<00:02:08.209> add<00:02:08.630> more<00:02:09.729> milk<00:02:10.729> if

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 
cook so feel free to add more milk if

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.479 
cook so feel free to add more milk if
you<00:02:11.060> want<00:02:11.360> it<00:02:11.450> to<00:02:11.540> be<00:02:11.630> thinner<00:02:11.900> so<00:02:12.769> it's<00:02:13.310> at<00:02:13.459> a

00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:13.489 
you want it to be thinner so it's at a

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:16.060 
you want it to be thinner so it's at a
boil<00:02:13.820> now<00:02:14.120> and<00:02:14.600> you<00:02:14.810> want<00:02:14.930> it<00:02:15.079> to<00:02:15.290> boil<00:02:15.560> for<00:02:15.739> a

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:16.070 
boil now and you want it to boil for a

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:18.520 
boil now and you want it to boil for a
while<00:02:16.160> so<00:02:16.880> it<00:02:17.060> gets<00:02:17.420> rid<00:02:17.630> of<00:02:17.720> the<00:02:17.870> flour<00:02:18.140> taste

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
while so it gets rid of the flour taste

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:23.830 
while so it gets rid of the flour taste
and<00:02:20.320> so<00:02:21.320> once<00:02:21.650> that's<00:02:21.920> done<00:02:22.540> boiling<00:02:23.540> for<00:02:23.780> a

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
and so once that's done boiling for a

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:24.620 
and so once that's done boiling for a
few<00:02:24.079> minutes

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
few minutes

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:28.910 
few minutes

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
then you have your white sauce and this

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.670 
then you have your white sauce and this
is<00:02:29.220> the<00:02:29.610> base<00:02:30.300> for<00:02:30.690> a<00:02:30.720> lot<00:02:30.810> of<00:02:31.020> sauces

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680
