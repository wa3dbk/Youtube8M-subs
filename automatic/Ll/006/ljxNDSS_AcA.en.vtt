need the tape and cutting in will take
less<00:00:41.640> time<00:00:42.500> it's<00:00:43.500> important<00:00:44.100> to<00:00:44.220> mention<00:00:44.399> that

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
less time it's important to mention that

this<00:00:49.920> is<00:00:49.980> just<00:00:50.399> one<00:00:50.790> way<00:00:51.030> to<00:00:51.090> do<00:00:51.360> it<00:00:51.739> let's

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
this is just one way to do it let's

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.610 
this is just one way to do it let's
start<00:00:53.129> with<00:00:53.250> the<00:00:53.340> brush<00:00:53.660> some<00:00:54.660> pros<00:00:54.960> prefer<00:00:55.469> to

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
start with the brush some pros prefer to

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.220 
start with the brush some pros prefer to
use<00:00:55.800> angled<00:00:56.399> brushes<00:00:56.670> for<00:00:56.969> this<00:00:57.149> task<00:00:57.420> but<00:00:57.809> a

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
use angled brushes for this task but a

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.220 
use angled brushes for this task but a
straight<00:00:58.559> brush<00:00:58.860> will<00:00:59.280> also<00:00:59.610> do<00:00:59.760> the<00:00:59.879> job

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:00.230 
straight brush will also do the job
