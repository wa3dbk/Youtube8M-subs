00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229 
which is really good because it knocks

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:10.199 
which is really good because it knocks
him<00:02:08.470> down<00:02:08.500> so<00:02:09.190> I<00:02:09.220> should<00:02:09.550> have<00:02:09.640> won<00:02:09.819> this<00:02:09.970> fight

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:10.209

the<00:02:12.099> right<00:02:12.310> mouse<00:02:12.550> button<00:02:12.780> because<00:02:13.780> it's<00:02:13.930> a

00:02:13.979 --> 00:02:13.989 
the right mouse button because it's a

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:15.930 
the right mouse button because it's a
pretty<00:02:14.230> obvious<00:02:14.800> stun<00:02:15.129> that's<00:02:15.400> coming<00:02:15.730> in<00:02:15.819> to

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
pretty obvious stun that's coming in to

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:17.369 
pretty obvious stun that's coming in to
knock<00:02:16.090> me<00:02:16.239> down<00:02:16.269> that<00:02:16.690> javelin

00:02:17.369 --> 00:02:17.379

00:02:19.589 --> 00:02:19.599

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:22.080 
I get a stun back on him we're fighting
back<00:02:19.750> and<00:02:19.900> forth<00:02:19.989> and<00:02:20.349> again<00:02:20.680> I<00:02:20.890> miss<00:02:21.580> another

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
back and forth and again I miss another

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.479 
back and forth and again I miss another
block<00:02:22.540> and<00:02:22.870> I<00:02:23.230> have<00:02:23.260> the<00:02:23.620> stamina<00:02:23.860> to<00:02:24.040> block<00:02:24.280> it

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:24.489 
block and I have the stamina to block it

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:26.250 
block and I have the stamina to block it
so<00:02:24.700> I<00:02:24.730> died<00:02:25.090> and<00:02:25.360> really<00:02:25.569> I<00:02:25.599> could<00:02:25.989> have<00:02:26.110> won

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260
