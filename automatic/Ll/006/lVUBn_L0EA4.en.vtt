00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
alone in a forest with him and he's

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.359 
alone in a forest with him and he's
obviously<00:01:39.810> up<00:01:40.049> to<00:01:40.079> no<00:01:40.200> good<00:01:40.320> when<00:01:40.979> it<00:01:41.100> comes<00:01:41.250> to

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
obviously up to no good when it comes to

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.010 
obviously up to no good when it comes to
graphics<00:01:41.579> they<00:01:42.000> don't<00:01:42.180> really<00:01:42.390> stand<00:01:42.689> up<00:01:42.869> to

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
graphics they don't really stand up to

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.050 
graphics they don't really stand up to
close<00:01:43.229> inspection<00:01:43.560> in<00:01:44.159> fact<00:01:44.430> the<00:01:44.610> textures

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
close inspection in fact the textures

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.569 
close inspection in fact the textures
are<00:01:45.210> pretty<00:01:45.479> basic<00:01:45.780> however<00:01:46.619> when<00:01:47.070> the<00:01:47.130> camera

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
are pretty basic however when the camera

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.130 
are pretty basic however when the camera
is<00:01:47.610> twitching<00:01:48.149> all<00:01:48.240> over<00:01:48.450> the<00:01:48.570> place<00:01:48.780> and<00:01:49.020> your

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
is twitching all over the place and your

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.899 
is twitching all over the place and your
torches<00:01:49.560> wobbling<00:01:49.950> as<00:01:50.100> you<00:01:50.189> run<00:01:50.369> breathless

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
torches wobbling as you run breathless

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.819 
torches wobbling as you run breathless
through<00:01:51.180> the<00:01:51.329> forest<00:01:51.720> it<00:01:51.960> does<00:01:52.350> actually<00:01:52.530> look

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
through the forest it does actually look

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.980 
through the forest it does actually look
really<00:01:53.009> good<00:01:53.490> slender<00:01:54.329> the<00:01:54.360> arrival<00:01:54.479> is<00:01:54.960> a

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
really good slender the arrival is a

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.840 
really good slender the arrival is a
short<00:01:55.350> game<00:01:55.590> but<00:01:55.860> it<00:01:55.950> will<00:01:56.130> get<00:01:56.310> in<00:01:56.490> your<00:01:56.640> head

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
short game but it will get in your head

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.090 
short game but it will get in your head
I<00:01:57.090> had<00:01:57.570> funny<00:01:57.810> dreams<00:01:58.140> after<00:01:58.469> I<00:01:58.530> played<00:01:58.740> it<00:01:58.950> and

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
I had funny dreams after I played it and

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.920 
I had funny dreams after I played it and
I'm<00:01:59.189> sure<00:01:59.369> mr.<00:01:59.640> Slenderman<00:02:00.299> will<00:02:00.509> visit<00:02:00.840> me

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
I'm sure mr. Slenderman will visit me

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.990 
I'm sure mr. Slenderman will visit me
again<00:02:01.049> the<00:02:01.649> game's<00:02:01.890> less<00:02:02.159> than<00:02:02.369> a<00:02:02.430> 10<00:02:02.700> or<00:02:02.820> two

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
again the game's less than a 10 or two

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.730 
again the game's less than a 10 or two
so<00:02:03.329> if<00:02:03.420> you<00:02:03.540> do<00:02:03.659> like<00:02:03.869> to<00:02:04.020> get<00:02:04.170> scared<00:02:04.500> it's

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
so if you do like to get scared it's

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.830 
so if you do like to get scared it's
definitely<00:02:05.460> worth<00:02:05.670> a<00:02:05.820> go<00:02:06.030> all<00:02:06.479> things

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
definitely worth a go all things

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.900 
definitely worth a go all things
considered<00:02:07.380> it<00:02:07.530> gets<00:02:07.920> a<00:02:08.009> cheap<00:02:08.280> and<00:02:08.489> not<00:02:08.700> so

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
considered it gets a cheap and not so

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.440 
considered it gets a cheap and not so
cheerful<00:02:09.450> 7<00:02:09.989> out<00:02:10.110> of<00:02:10.140> 10
