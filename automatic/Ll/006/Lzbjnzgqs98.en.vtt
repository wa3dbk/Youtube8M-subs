00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.950 
now I'm like I'm gonna save it because
it's<00:01:50.250> still<00:01:50.520> a<00:01:50.549> good<00:01:50.759> gel<00:01:51.030> liner<00:01:51.299> it's<00:01:51.689> just

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
it's still a good gel liner it's just

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.590 
it's still a good gel liner it's just
super<00:01:52.950> dried<00:01:53.250> out<00:01:53.430> because<00:01:53.670> I<00:01:54.090> left<00:01:54.240> the<00:01:54.390> cap

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
super dried out because I left the cap

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.420 
super dried out because I left the cap
off<00:01:54.869> if<00:01:55.170> your<00:01:55.560> liner<00:01:55.740> dries<00:01:55.979> out<00:01:56.159> without<00:01:56.280> the

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
off if your liner dries out without the

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:57.830 
off if your liner dries out without the
cap<00:01:56.579> off<00:01:56.729> and<00:01:56.880> it's<00:01:56.969> just<00:01:57.119> a<00:01:57.180> bad<00:01:57.299> liner<00:01:57.540> on

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
cap off and it's just a bad liner on

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.080 
cap off and it's just a bad liner on
this<00:01:58.409> may<00:01:58.619> not<00:01:58.829> do<00:01:59.070> anything<00:01:59.280> to<00:01:59.430> save<00:01:59.729> it<00:01:59.909> if

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
this may not do anything to save it if

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.569 
this may not do anything to save it if
it<00:02:00.210> just<00:02:00.450> sucks<00:02:00.960> but<00:02:01.590> this<00:02:01.710> liner<00:02:01.979> is<00:02:02.100> really

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
it just sucks but this liner is really

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.039 
it just sucks but this liner is really
really<00:02:02.850> good<00:02:03.000> it's<00:02:03.240> a<00:02:03.299> great<00:02:03.479> black<00:02:03.659> liner<00:02:03.930> I

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
really good it's a great black liner I

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:05.450 
really good it's a great black liner I
have<00:02:04.290> it<00:02:04.409> in<00:02:04.530> brown<00:02:04.680> sometimes<00:02:05.219> for<00:02:05.399> my

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
have it in brown sometimes for my

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.380 
have it in brown sometimes for my
eyebrows<00:02:05.869> um<00:02:06.869> I<00:02:07.200> really<00:02:07.860> like<00:02:07.890> it<00:02:08.250> so<00:02:08.940> it's

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
eyebrows um I really like it so it's

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.360 
eyebrows um I really like it so it's
definitely<00:02:09.599> worth<00:02:10.110> it<00:02:10.289> to<00:02:10.440> try<00:02:10.649> to<00:02:10.709> save<00:02:11.009> it<00:02:11.190> as

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
definitely worth it to try to save it as

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.750 
definitely worth it to try to save it as
you<00:02:11.700> can<00:02:11.819> see<00:02:12.000> I<00:02:12.030> haven't<00:02:12.360> really<00:02:12.720> looked<00:02:12.959> too

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
you can see I haven't really looked too

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.690 
you can see I haven't really looked too
and<00:02:14.760> it's<00:02:15.000> a<00:02:15.090> slightly<00:02:15.330> messy<00:02:15.960> task<00:02:16.460> but<00:02:17.460> at

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
and it's a slightly messy task but at

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.160 
and it's a slightly messy task but at
the<00:02:17.790> end<00:02:17.940> of<00:02:18.030> the<00:02:18.120> day<00:02:18.270> it<00:02:18.540> is<00:02:18.690> worth<00:02:18.930> it

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
the end of the day it is worth it

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.040 
the end of the day it is worth it
because<00:02:19.350> the<00:02:19.740> eye<00:02:19.770> liner<00:02:20.190> itself<00:02:20.700> is<00:02:21.050> amazing

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
because the eye liner itself is amazing

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:25.280 
because the eye liner itself is amazing
and<00:02:22.290> I<00:02:23.280> don't<00:02:23.520> want<00:02:23.760> to<00:02:24.000> let<00:02:24.660> it<00:02:24.750> go<00:02:24.900> it<00:02:25.140> was

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
and I don't want to let it go it was

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.500 
and I don't want to let it go it was
only<00:02:25.530> a<00:02:25.560> 4<00:02:25.950> or<00:02:25.980> 5<00:02:26.070> bucks<00:02:26.370> so<00:02:26.820> it's<00:02:27.060> not<00:02:27.240> really

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
only a 4 or 5 bucks so it's not really

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.240 
only a 4 or 5 bucks so it's not really
an<00:02:27.600> expensive<00:02:27.900> one<00:02:28.260> but<00:02:28.500> it<00:02:28.650> is<00:02:28.680> one<00:02:28.830> of<00:02:29.160> the

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
an expensive one but it is one of the

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.600 
an expensive one but it is one of the
best<00:02:29.490> eyeliners<00:02:30.060> that<00:02:30.300> I<00:02:30.990> own<00:02:31.530> so<00:02:32.370> what<00:02:32.550> I'm

exact eyeliner looks like I did clean it

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:15.680 
exact eyeliner looks like I did clean it
up<00:03:13.560> because<00:03:14.160> it<00:03:14.370> was<00:03:14.489> some<00:03:14.700> eyeliner<00:03:15.180> all<00:03:15.390> over

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
up because it was some eyeliner all over

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:17.479 
up because it was some eyeliner all over
so<00:03:15.840> I<00:03:15.870> just<00:03:16.110> used<00:03:16.350> a<00:03:16.500> tissue<00:03:16.800> and<00:03:17.070> cleaned<00:03:17.310> up

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
the rim and if you can see it looks a

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:24.110 
the rim and if you can see it looks a
lot<00:03:21.150> better<00:03:21.540> it<00:03:22.200> doesn't<00:03:22.769> look<00:03:23.070> as<00:03:23.250> thick<00:03:23.880> and

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
lot better it doesn't look as thick and

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.420

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959 
interesting to me I guess because when I

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:03.259 
interesting to me I guess because when I
saw<00:04:01.260> it<00:04:01.440> wherever<00:04:02.100> I<00:04:02.280> saw<00:04:02.489> it<00:04:02.610> online<00:04:02.730> maybe<00:04:03.120> it

00:04:03.259 --> 00:04:03.269 
saw it wherever I saw it online maybe it

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:05.690 
saw it wherever I saw it online maybe it
was<00:04:03.360> Pinterest<00:04:03.840> I<00:04:03.989> was<00:04:04.110> like<00:04:04.260> oh<00:04:04.700> that's

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:05.700 
was Pinterest I was like oh that's

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:08.390 
was Pinterest I was like oh that's
clever<00:04:06.329> why<00:04:06.690> didn't<00:04:07.110> I<00:04:07.230> think<00:04:07.290> of<00:04:07.530> that<00:04:07.590> I<00:04:07.980> know

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
clever why didn't I think of that I know

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.160 
clever why didn't I think of that I know
there's<00:04:08.700> other<00:04:08.850> ways<00:04:09.180> but<00:04:09.420> this<00:04:09.570> is<00:04:09.780> just<00:04:10.019> a

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:10.170 
there's other ways but this is just a

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:12.830 
there's other ways but this is just a
simple<00:04:10.350> way<00:04:10.590> to<00:04:10.620> do<00:04:10.860> it<00:04:11.010> so<00:04:11.269> yeah<00:04:12.269> this<00:04:12.600> liner

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:12.840 
simple way to do it so yeah this liner

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:14.509 
simple way to do it so yeah this liner
is<00:04:13.019> not<00:04:13.079> like<00:04:13.440> the<00:04:13.680> greatest<00:04:13.920> one<00:04:14.250> in<00:04:14.430> the

00:04:14.509 --> 00:04:14.519

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:16.219 
is not like the greatest one in the
world<00:04:14.730> so<00:04:15.180> that's<00:04:15.450> why<00:04:15.660> it<00:04:15.780> doesn't<00:04:15.930> look<00:04:16.200> that

00:04:16.219 --> 00:04:16.229 
world so that's why it doesn't look that

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:18.920 
world so that's why it doesn't look that
black<00:04:16.530> but<00:04:16.979> if<00:04:17.280> it<00:04:17.519> ever<00:04:17.640> happens<00:04:18.060> to<00:04:18.269> my<00:04:18.390> baby
