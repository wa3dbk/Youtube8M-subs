we're going for the stairs can so

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:50.260 
we're going for the stairs can so
basically<00:03:48.560> what<00:03:48.770> i<00:03:48.800> have<00:03:49.010> now<00:03:49.220> is<00:03:49.520> charging

is to take the cube by 3 and put it like
right<00:03:58.120> and<00:03:59.120> then<00:03:59.870> put<00:04:00.140> a<00:04:00.170> 2<00:04:00.380> by<00:04:00.590> 2<00:04:03.190> really<00:04:04.300> then

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:05.300 
right and then put a 2 by 2 really then

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:10.540 
right and then put a 2 by 2 really then
you<00:04:05.989> will<00:04:06.230> put<00:04:06.459> this<00:04:07.459> on<00:04:09.069> right<00:04:10.069> on<00:04:10.280> top<00:04:10.520> of

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:10.550 
you will put this on right on top of

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:14.170 
you will put this on right on top of
that<00:04:10.819> and<00:04:11.780> then<00:04:11.930> it's<00:04:12.110> all<00:04:12.290> flat<00:04:12.820> rock<00:04:13.820> pile

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:14.180 
that and then it's all flat rock pile

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:17.020 
that and then it's all flat rock pile
then<00:04:14.930> you<00:04:15.140> know<00:04:16.130> where<00:04:16.310> to<00:04:16.400> put<00:04:16.519> the<00:04:16.640> wheels<00:04:16.850> on

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:17.030 
then you know where to put the wheels on

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:19.810 
then you know where to put the wheels on
the<00:04:17.090> back<00:04:17.720> the<00:04:18.590> big<00:04:18.829> ones<00:04:19.070> only<00:04:19.310> fit<00:04:19.640> in<00:04:19.760> the

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:19.820 
the back the big ones only fit in the

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:27.340 
the back the big ones only fit in the
back<00:04:22.900> you<00:04:23.900> know<00:04:24.080> how<00:04:24.260> that<00:04:24.470> goes<00:04:26.020> there's<00:04:27.020> your

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:27.350 
back you know how that goes there's your

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:31.330 
back you know how that goes there's your
car<00:04:27.650> I<00:04:29.200> think<00:04:30.200> it<00:04:30.350> would<00:04:30.440> be<00:04:30.470> pretty<00:04:30.770> nice<00:04:31.040> to

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:31.340 
car I think it would be pretty nice to

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:38.080 
car I think it would be pretty nice to
have<00:04:31.490> to<00:04:32.090> play<00:04:32.320> tennis<00:04:33.320> it's<00:04:33.890> a<00:04:35.680> the<00:04:37.090> what's

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:38.090 
have to play tennis it's a the what's

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:40.480 
have to play tennis it's a the what's
the<00:04:38.480> pieces<00:04:38.870> are<00:04:39.020> pretty<00:04:39.290> tight<00:04:39.530> and<00:04:39.830> you

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:40.490 
the pieces are pretty tight and you

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:42.400 
the pieces are pretty tight and you
might<00:04:40.669> say<00:04:40.700> it<00:04:40.970> virtually<00:04:41.410> indestructible

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:42.410 
might say it virtually indestructible

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:44.560 
might say it virtually indestructible
falling<00:04:42.860> down<00:04:43.070> the<00:04:43.220> stairs<00:04:43.490> so<00:04:44.270> they<00:04:44.330> won't

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:44.570 
falling down the stairs so they won't

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:47.370 
falling down the stairs so they won't
have<00:04:44.720> to<00:04:44.870> look<00:04:45.080> for<00:04:45.290> anything<00:04:45.530> but<00:04:46.010> there's<00:04:46.610> a

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:47.380 
have to look for anything but there's a

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:54.219 
have to look for anything but there's a
there's<00:04:48.380> a<00:04:49.060> perhaps<00:04:50.060> a<00:04:51.940> 86.5<00:04:52.940> percent<00:04:53.690> that

00:04:54.219 --> 00:04:54.229 
there's a perhaps a 86.5 percent that

00:04:54.229 --> 00:04:57.520 
there's a perhaps a 86.5 percent that
you'll<00:04:54.530> lose<00:04:54.800> these<00:04:55.160> wheels<00:04:55.900> or<00:04:56.900> the<00:04:57.290> wheels

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:57.530 
you'll lose these wheels or the wheels

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:01.090 
you'll lose these wheels or the wheels
will<00:04:57.800> just<00:04:58.010> fall<00:04:58.310> off<00:04:58.340> like<00:04:58.880> that<00:04:59.470> out<00:05:00.470> of<00:05:00.530> it

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:01.100 
will just fall off like that out of it

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:04.600 
will just fall off like that out of it
the<00:05:01.820> only<00:05:02.180> thought<00:05:02.950> but<00:05:03.950> you<00:05:04.100> might<00:05:04.400> have<00:05:04.580> a

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:04.610 
the only thought but you might have a

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:06.340 
the only thought but you might have a
ten<00:05:04.910> percent<00:05:05.090> chance<00:05:05.570> that<00:05:05.750> these<00:05:05.990> are<00:05:06.200> going

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:06.350 
ten percent chance that these are going

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:11.320 
ten percent chance that these are going
to<00:05:06.410> fall<00:05:06.620> off<00:05:07.780> so<00:05:08.780> I'd<00:05:08.930> recommend<00:05:09.700> if<00:05:10.700> you<00:05:10.910> love

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:11.330 
to fall off so I'd recommend if you love

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:17.340 
to fall off so I'd recommend if you love
this<00:05:11.630> car<00:05:11.870> so<00:05:12.080> much<00:05:12.140> i<00:05:14.050> recommend<00:05:15.050> by

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:17.350 
this car so much i recommend by

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:22.360 
this car so much i recommend by
expressing<00:05:19.510> people<00:05:20.510> who<00:05:20.660> want<00:05:20.900> it<00:05:21.160> but<00:05:22.160> i

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:22.370 
expressing people who want it but i

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:27.520 
expressing people who want it but i
would<00:05:25.419> wouldn't<00:05:26.419> be<00:05:26.630> the<00:05:26.780> best<00:05:26.810> because<00:05:27.380> if

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:27.530 
would wouldn't be the best because if

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:29.980 
would wouldn't be the best because if
you<00:05:27.650> got<00:05:27.830> blue<00:05:28.130> in<00:05:28.280> the<00:05:28.400> motor<00:05:28.610> then<00:05:29.270> you

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:29.990 
you got blue in the motor then you

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:31.690 
you got blue in the motor then you
wouldn't<00:05:30.260> have<00:05:30.289> that<00:05:30.380> car<00:05:30.860> or<00:05:31.280> you<00:05:31.400> just

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:31.700 
wouldn't have that car or you just

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:37.719 
wouldn't have that car or you just
wasted<00:05:32.300> them<00:05:32.510> five<00:05:33.110> dollars<00:05:35.350> so<00:05:36.350> i<00:05:36.590> will<00:05:37.070> see

00:05:37.719 --> 00:05:37.729
