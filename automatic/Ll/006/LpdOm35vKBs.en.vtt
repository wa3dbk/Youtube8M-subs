00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:08.509
 Hello, how are you all friends? 

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:10.220
 I am young and I bring you in this new 

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:12.080
 video from your online universe in the 

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:14.900
 which then I will show you this new 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:17.330
 gift to us this gift that we have 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:19.609
 given the friends of the dc universe online ' 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:23.949
 And is that because many people are 

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:23.949
 they have given away months of legendary 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.820
 this is not the first time it happens already 

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:30.430
 that last year, it also happened 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:33.570
 something happened the same they gave us a 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:35.400
 the legendary month totally free 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.950
 this month of January it does not include 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:39.480
 500 static that usually give us when 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.580
 we buy legendary though 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:45.030
 gives us part of the legendary 

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:46.770
 give 150 replay you will know then the 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.780
 replay are those that we use to 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.970
 reset the instances that we have 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.920
 blocked 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:55.080
 I'm not the truth that I'm not very clear 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.570
 if they were given the legendary 

00:00:55.080 --> 00:01:00.239
 people who have been there for more than a year 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:02.309
 registered or if they are people that some 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.930
 once they bought the membership he did not 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.760
 I have very clear to me then both times 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:10.610
 who gave it to me came to me too 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:12.230
 and well the truth is that I think it's good 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:13.370
 I think it's good from them 

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:16.460
 give us a month 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:18.500
 the legendary unfortunately not 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.930
 we will be able to enjoy the good maximum 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:24.470
 some people because how will they know 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:27.470
 we are in a festive season and not so 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:31.550
 in this time many people are usually 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:33.530
 including me usually travel and other then 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:36.050
 they usually do not play as much in the 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:37.820
 good computer I say no then it 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:40.700
 supposed to be a time to spend it on 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:42.890
 family however , if you do not go to 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:45.290
 travel and they gave you the month 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:47.840
 enjoy it if I'm not wrong I think that 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:50.909
 this expires on January 14 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.619
 January 14th if January 14th expires so 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.619
 you have to enjoy it to the fullest as if 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:57.149
 it has never been legendary since legendary 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.850
 because it gives you many advantages you have all 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:01.799
 the dlc you have access you have access to 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.350
 all because you have no limitations you have 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:06.509
 access to all your money in your inventory 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.020
 it is double the size of the bank 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:10.060
 as well 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:12.700
 You can sell many things in the 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:15.490
 brooklyn you can open the boxes by 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:17.140

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:19.030

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:31.570
