00:00:33.619 --> 00:00:33.629 
about two parts and then to that we're

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:37.150 
about two parts and then to that we're
going<00:00:33.719> to<00:00:33.780> add<00:00:33.930> about<00:00:34.079> a<00:00:34.230> part<00:00:34.680> in<00:00:34.859> a<00:00:34.949> third<00:00:35.520> of

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
using Grand Marnier you could use triple

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.290 
using Grand Marnier you could use triple
sec<00:00:42.809> or<00:00:43.050> Cointreau<00:00:44.040> of<00:00:44.309> course<00:00:44.610> their<00:00:44.850> varying

will<00:00:48.600> suffice<00:00:52.790> one<00:00:53.790> part<00:00:54.090> equals<00:00:54.570> one<00:00:54.840> ounce

00:00:59.830 --> 00:00:59.840 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.060 

and<00:01:00.840> it's<00:01:01.110> important<00:01:01.530> to<00:01:01.620> measure<00:01:01.800> these

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
and it's important to measure these

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.130 
and it's important to measure these
ingredients<00:01:02.699> out<00:01:02.820> if<00:01:03.030> you<00:01:03.120> have<00:01:03.390> jiggers<00:01:03.899> and

they're very inexpensive they're the

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.999 
they're very inexpensive they're the
ideal<00:01:05.909> measurement<00:01:06.869> tool<00:01:07.049> for<00:01:07.289> cocktails<00:01:07.740> if

00:01:07.999 --> 00:01:08.009 
ideal measurement tool for cocktails if

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:09.889 
ideal measurement tool for cocktails if
you<00:01:08.340> have<00:01:08.520> a<00:01:08.549> kitchen<00:01:08.850> measuring<00:01:09.389> glass<00:01:09.509> that

00:01:09.889 --> 00:01:09.899 
you have a kitchen measuring glass that

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:11.870 
you have a kitchen measuring glass that
has<00:01:10.049> ounce<00:01:10.380> marks<00:01:10.799> on<00:01:10.979> them<00:01:11.130> you<00:01:11.249> can<00:01:11.429> use<00:01:11.639> that

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
has ounce marks on them you can use that

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.940 
has ounce marks on them you can use that
as<00:01:12.060> well<00:01:12.270> now<00:01:13.020> for<00:01:13.170> that<00:01:13.319> we'll<00:01:13.499> add<00:01:13.679> equal

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
as well now for that we'll add equal

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.779 
as well now for that we'll add equal

there's a solid seal between the two

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.830 
there's a solid seal between the two
parts<00:02:05.029> and<00:02:06.029> then<00:02:06.149> you're<00:02:06.270> going<00:02:06.359> to<00:02:06.419> shake<00:02:06.689> it

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
parts and then you're going to shake it

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:12.170 
parts and then you're going to shake it
with<00:02:06.989> good<00:02:07.169> bigger

now once the cocktail is well chilled
you're<00:02:15.430> just<00:02:15.610> going<00:02:15.730> to<00:02:15.790> give<00:02:15.909> one<00:02:16.180> strong<00:02:16.780> tap

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
you're just going to give one strong tap

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.190 
you're just going to give one strong tap
on<00:02:17.500> the<00:02:18.099> side<00:02:18.340> of<00:02:18.519> the<00:02:18.610> mixing<00:02:18.939> glass<00:02:19.030> and<00:02:19.450> the

on the side of the mixing glass and the

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.490 
on the side of the mixing glass and the
two<00:02:20.349> parts<00:02:20.650> will<00:02:20.799> remove<00:02:21.069> with<00:02:21.340> relative<00:02:21.790> ease

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
two parts will remove with relative ease
