00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:12.929
 hello and pvc pipe list I am potato 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.309
 Welcome back to the surviving river. 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:17.720
 in today's video let's talk about 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:20.000
 wood flashes 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:21.619
 in the first video I made about how 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.390
 make handmade flashes 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:26.119
 The link below is the first 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:27.500
 comment that came in was not up to me 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:29.840
 I still took the trouble to talk to the 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:32.629
 Face to know why the guy does not pay. 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:35.329
 paraded a series of reasons for the 

00:00:32.629 --> 00:00:37.850
 which I should use arrows or 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:42.290
 aluminum or carbon fiber and it 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:43.970
 once you use aluminum arrows 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:47.809
 or carbon fiber did not want 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:51.110
 traditional is how you put a look 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:52.760
 on a black powder gun at 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:55.780
 from the moment the user buys 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:58.549
 a traditional act uses the clamp 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:00.949
 traditional gloves to the 

00:00:58.549 --> 00:01:02.960
 traditional games practice the kind of 

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:04.430
 art that would go traditional I stay 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.229
 wondering why he will not either 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:07.850
 use traditional arcade flash 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:10.790
 traditionally combines perfectly with 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:12.409
 bousquet for several reasons including 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:15.619
 with survival because you will have 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:17.659
 much easier to produce parts 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:19.280
 made of wood than to produce a 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:20.960
 bow made of carbon fiber by 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.390
 example that others for you today are 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.430
 top wooden flashlights 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:27.350
 this is not flex produced by the 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:30.200
 potatoes, which are flashes that have been 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:32.900
 given to me by rba wanted 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.220
 they have a collection of arrows there they 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:34.940
 sell to those who practice theory 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:37.460
 traditional 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:40.430
 you can enter the site and check 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:43.159
 I received is two sets grand prize 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:44.540
 and the ego flashes already comes with all 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:46.310
 measures and weight nÃ© 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:48.290
 you will get in touch with them at 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:50.510
 ask for what it is and I will bow you already 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:51.950
 send the arrows ready for that 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:54.320
 type of file you want and many 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:55.940
 people will get to talk ah but the a 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.740
 Wooden arrow does not have as much 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:00.470
 resistance or does not have a useful life 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:03.560
 long is wooden flashes in arts 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:05.510
 have a long and good life. 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:08.360
 like a carbon fiber arrow 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:10.729
 Hunting Target Compose When You Buy 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.900
 an arrow of this type here an arrow 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:14.930
 top notch 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:17.239
 you will mainly have parameters 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:20.060
 You're right, you'll know what it is. 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:22.129
 really an arrow made of wood 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.590
 to get a high performance you up 

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:28.970
 gets suddenly in your house produced 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:30.610
 a wooden arrow is based year by 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.290
 other materials is very 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:34.930
 It is important that you take an arrow from your 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:38.640
 where you can see this type of 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:38.640
 Here're finished 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:46.829
 perceive the textures know which is 

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:49.530
 exact strength of a penalty flashes 

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:52.920
 traditional how nokia fits into the 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:55.319
 rope check the weight of the tip feel 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:58.590
 as is the twist of the arrow material 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:03:00.840
 How is this going to give you parameters? 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.519
 all you would with other arrows 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.170
 using wooden flash 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:06.810
 the issue of performance when you 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:09.060
 buy an arrow that is made under 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:11.310
 measure for your bow it will have the 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:13.650
 the best possible performance for that 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:17.030
 stuff worth remembering that arrow 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:19.709
 aluminum carbon fiber arrows 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:22.950
 these things are in operation 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:25.889
 planet has been studying for some years 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:27.780
 here are thousands of years of use then 

00:03:25.889 --> 00:03:30.030
 do not neglect the potential of 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:31.920
 wood, this has already written history 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:34.109
 is this is the cool time where people 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:35.730
 begins to stick things and tests the 

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:38.450
 resistance of the arrows of 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:38.450
 rydell wanted 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:05.060
 ae 

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:49.770
