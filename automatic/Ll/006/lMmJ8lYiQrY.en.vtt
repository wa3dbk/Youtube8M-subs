00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:10.620
 gentlemen students allow me to perform 

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:13.350
 the video tutorial related to 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:17.869
 levels of body organization 

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:22.650
 human this video tutorial is 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:26.550
 scheduled for Monday 24th until 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:29.939
 Sunday, September 30 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:32.099
 in this sense first congratulate them 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:37.830
 the students who have managed to enter 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:41.190
 and make it the presentation forum and 

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:43.650
 the other research forum 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:47.400
 clarifying only that you are 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:51.270
 interventions are for the 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:53.790
 students get involved in the actions 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:57.300
 pedagogical to reach the 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:59.670
 significant learnings 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:03.030
 the mind you know that this 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:06.330
 subject is related to the 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:09.510
 pedagogy to education to training 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:13.950
 of you as a pedagogue and at the same time 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:17.460
 know how to identify and get to be able to help 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:22.229
 to the community to the students about 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:25.220
 physiology and health in this case 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:29.910
 we will address the levels of organization 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:32.789
 of the human body the human body here 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:36.360
 is the photograph is formed by 

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:39.960
 several levels that organize all the 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:43.140
 human body between the levels that 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:47.160
 according to the attributions of several doctors and 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:50.910
 researchers point out that they are trained 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:54.479
 by the chemical level the cellular level the 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:56.790
 tissue level the organic level and the 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:02:00.090
 systemic level 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:03.930
 why we are going to address the levels 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:07.860
 of organization let's talk about the level 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:11.660
 chemist this level is formed 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:16.170
 practically by chemical substances 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:19.190
 as carbon hydrogen oxygen and 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:23.400
 nitrogen this is these compounds 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:26.820
 they represent 96 percent of all the 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:29.459
 human body and the rest is 4 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:33.060
 percent are composed of compounds 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:36.959
 as proteins lipids and carbohydrates 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:42.150
 in this sense practically the level 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:46.290
 chemical is related to all these 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:49.440
 compounds that give life and support to 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:53.580
 the organs, devices and systems of 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:56.880
 human body we go to the cellular level the 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:03:00.110
 cellular level as we all know our 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:03.510
 human body is made up of cells 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:07.080
 being this an anato unit 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:10.829
 and functional of the human body that is 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:14.879
 formed by the nucleus and the whole part 

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:17.549
 called cytoplasm is not for the rest 

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:18.209
 point out that there are functions of 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:21.329
 cells 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:24.170
 among them are function of 

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:27.379
 irritability conductivity 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:30.739
 contractility absorption and assimilation 

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:34.799
 respiratory expression secretion 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:39.090
 growth and reproduction instead the 

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:42.989
 tissue level refers practically to 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:45.780
 the tissues that are involved in 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:49.440
 the whole human body these tissues 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:52.799
 they can be muscular connective epithelial 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:55.680
 and nervous here we find the body 

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:58.139
 human that is formed by organs 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:59.879
 look at the organs here we are going to 

00:03:58.139 --> 00:04:02.340
 realize that we found some 

00:03:59.879 --> 00:04:05.670
 small cells in these little 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:08.069
 cells you will find the cellular level and 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:10.840
 also the chemical level 

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:14.140
 irradiating a series of substances 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:17.079
 Chemicals for you to observe 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:20.940
 that within this human body there are 

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:24.910
 everyone else that we have been talking about 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:28.120
 let's move on to the organic level that is 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:31.380
 formed by the organs an organ is a 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:35.139
 set of tissues that constitute 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:38.139
 practically the anatomical entity and 

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:42.070
 functional who does not know an organ of the 

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:45.250
 eye stomach heart bone muscle and 

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:48.310
 pump list and to reach the level 

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:50.680
 systemic is to say that it comprises the 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:53.440
 systems of the human body like the 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:56.260
 digestive system the muscular system the 

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:59.100
 respiratory system and in turn these 

00:04:56.260 --> 00:05:02.160
 systems contribute to three large 

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:05.280
 functions like the relationship function 

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:08.740
 nutrition and production 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:12.460
 finally returning to the first part 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:15.940
 we realize that the human body 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:18.789
 It consists of five levels on 

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:21.669
 chemical substances level 

00:05:18.789 --> 00:05:24.160
 cellular we talk about the tissue cell 

00:05:21.669 --> 00:05:27.160
 we talk about organic tissues 

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:29.710
 we talk about the organs and the systemic 

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:33.599
 which is composed of that series of 

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:36.190
 systems that make up the human body 

00:05:33.599 --> 00:05:40.120
 go ahead dear students 

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:43.150
 help yourself with the study book 

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:47.020
 and mandatory next week 

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:49.560
 We will make the forum of doubts forward and 

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:49.560
 successes
