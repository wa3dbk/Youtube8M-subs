00:04:44.129 --> 00:04:44.139 

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:57.570 

and<00:04:45.139> it's<00:04:45.319> not<00:04:45.530> like<00:04:45.740> you<00:04:45.919> can<00:04:46.099> escape<00:04:46.370> from<00:04:46.550> me

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:57.580 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:01.510 

okay<00:04:58.580> that's<00:04:58.729> the<00:04:59.000> end<00:04:59.030> of<00:04:59.180> the<00:04:59.270> game<00:04:59.419> aha

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:01.520 
okay that's the end of the game aha

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:03.460 
okay that's the end of the game aha
that's<00:05:01.789> the<00:05:02.090> end<00:05:02.240> of<00:05:02.330> the<00:05:02.449> game<00:05:02.599> okay<00:05:03.440> I

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:03.470 
that's the end of the game okay I

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:05.200 
that's the end of the game okay I
thought<00:05:03.830> this<00:05:03.949> game<00:05:04.099> was<00:05:04.250> very<00:05:04.520> very<00:05:04.789> short

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:05.210 
thought this game was very very short

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:07.839 
thought this game was very very short
but<00:05:05.930> it<00:05:06.169> is<00:05:06.349> not<00:05:06.530> it<00:05:06.800> actually<00:05:06.919> had<00:05:07.250> a<00:05:07.280> decent

00:05:07.839 --> 00:05:07.849 
but it is not it actually had a decent

00:05:07.849 --> 00:05:10.089 
but it is not it actually had a decent
amount<00:05:07.909> left<00:05:08.360> to<00:05:08.539> it<00:05:08.690> I<00:05:08.870> thought<00:05:09.349> having<00:05:09.830> two

00:05:10.089 --> 00:05:10.099 
amount left to it I thought having two

00:05:10.099 --> 00:05:11.499 
amount left to it I thought having two
that<00:05:10.580> was<00:05:10.699> that<00:05:10.940> was<00:05:11.060> dumb

00:05:11.499 --> 00:05:11.509 
that was that was dumb

00:05:11.509 --> 00:05:13.719 
that was that was dumb
cuz<00:05:11.720> I<00:05:11.810> I<00:05:11.840> didn't<00:05:12.349> realize<00:05:12.740> I<00:05:12.770> had<00:05:13.009> heard<00:05:13.190> press

00:05:13.719 --> 00:05:13.729 
cuz I I didn't realize I had heard press

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:15.640 
cuz I I didn't realize I had heard press
shift<00:05:14.000> to<00:05:14.090> run<00:05:14.300> away<00:05:14.449> because<00:05:14.960> it<00:05:15.139> seemed<00:05:15.409> like

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:15.650 
shift to run away because it seemed like

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:17.860 
shift to run away because it seemed like
that<00:05:15.800> would<00:05:16.009> be<00:05:16.190> an<00:05:16.430> end<00:05:16.699> to<00:05:16.880> a<00:05:17.000> dot<00:05:17.240> exe<00:05:17.419> game

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:17.870 
that would be an end to a dot exe game

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:20.409 
that would be an end to a dot exe game
