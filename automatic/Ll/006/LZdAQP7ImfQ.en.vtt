00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.980 
new idea yesterday and it's working very
well<00:00:16.670> instead<00:00:17.670> of<00:00:17.730> just<00:00:18.000> using<00:00:18.330> the<00:00:18.660> tea<00:00:18.810> light

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990

its sturdy stainless steel now you'll

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.069 
its sturdy stainless steel now you'll
see<00:00:41.309> once<00:00:41.610> we<00:00:41.700> put<00:00:41.850> this<00:00:41.910> together<00:00:42.120> it<00:00:42.809> makes

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
see once we put this together it makes

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:44.900 
see once we put this together it makes
this<00:00:43.290> more<00:00:43.590> safer<00:00:44.160> and<00:00:44.280> more<00:00:44.399> rigid<00:00:44.610> and

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
this more safer and more rigid and

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.950 
this more safer and more rigid and
stable<00:00:46.100> in<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.520> other<00:00:47.640> video<00:00:47.940> I<00:00:48.030> mentioned<00:00:48.539> it

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
stable in the other video I mentioned it

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.990 
stable in the other video I mentioned it
was<00:00:49.170> probably<00:00:49.710> not<00:00:49.920> such<00:00:50.190> a<00:00:50.280> good<00:00:50.309> idea<00:00:50.730> to<00:00:50.910> be

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
was probably not such a good idea to be

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.939 
was probably not such a good idea to be
using<00:00:51.420> church<00:00:51.870> candles<00:00:52.410> these<00:00:52.620> pillar<00:00:53.629> type

00:00:54.939 --> 00:00:54.949 
using church candles these pillar type

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:57.529 
using church candles these pillar type
because<00:00:55.949> they're<00:00:56.160> normally<00:00:56.699> quite<00:00:56.969> high<00:00:57.210> and

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
because they're normally quite high and

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.810 
because they're normally quite high and
because<00:00:58.050> the<00:00:58.559> flame<00:00:58.859> is<00:00:59.070> near<00:00:59.309> as<00:00:59.399> the<00:00:59.520> top<00:00:59.730> of

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
because the flame is near as the top of

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.439 
because the flame is near as the top of
the<00:00:59.910> pot<00:01:00.120> and<00:01:00.960> the<00:01:01.500> carriage<00:01:01.890> bolt<00:01:02.329> there's<00:01:03.329> a

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
the pot and the carriage bolt there's a

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.030 
the pot and the carriage bolt there's a
chance<00:01:03.750> that's<00:01:03.960> going<00:01:04.170> to<00:01:04.260> create<00:01:04.470> carbon

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
chance that's going to create carbon

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.730 
chance that's going to create carbon
monoxide<00:01:05.580> but<00:01:06.210> these<00:01:06.420> certain<00:01:07.350> carbon

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
monoxide but these certain carbon

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.429 
monoxide but these certain carbon
deposits<00:01:08.450> but<00:01:09.450> if<00:01:09.750> you<00:01:09.960> get<00:01:10.140> one<00:01:10.290> of<00:01:10.320> these

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
deposits but if you get one of these

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.510 
deposits but if you get one of these
smaller<00:01:10.799> ones<00:01:11.210> they<00:01:12.210> work<00:01:12.390> birth<00:01:12.659> quite<00:01:13.049> fine

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:13.520 
smaller ones they work birth quite fine

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.179 
smaller ones they work birth quite fine

these meat thermometers and it's quite
accurate<00:02:45.040> so<00:02:46.040> it<00:02:46.190> should<00:02:46.340> give<00:02:46.519> us<00:02:46.549> an<00:02:46.700> idea

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.140 
accurate so it should give us an idea

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:49.420 
accurate so it should give us an idea
anyway<00:02:48.140> guys<00:02:48.290> I<00:02:48.590> will<00:02:48.799> put<00:02:48.980> back<00:02:49.130> there<00:02:49.280> now

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
anyway guys I will put back there now

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:53.289 
anyway guys I will put back there now
we'll<00:02:49.730> see<00:02:49.880> the<00:02:49.910> results<00:02:52.000> all<00:02:53.000> right<00:02:53.090> guys

00:02:53.289 --> 00:02:53.299 
we'll see the results all right guys

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:56.920 
we'll see the results all right guys
we're<00:02:54.640> just<00:02:55.640> a<00:02:55.790> little<00:02:55.819> over<00:02:56.390> half<00:02:56.599> an<00:02:56.780> hour

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
we're just a little over half an hour

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:01.390 
we're just a little over half an hour
into<00:02:57.080> the<00:02:57.500> test<00:02:58.010> and<00:02:58.310> you<00:02:58.430> can<00:02:58.760> see<00:02:58.940> this<00:03:00.400> 165

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 
into the test and you can see this 165

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.890 
into the test and you can see this 165
degrees<00:03:01.820> and<00:03:02.090> rising

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:04.900 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:08.020 

there<00:03:05.900> you<00:03:05.959> go<00:03:06.049> guys<00:03:06.260> I<00:03:06.500> just<00:03:07.280> want<00:03:07.730> to<00:03:07.820> show

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 
there you go guys I just want to show

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:10.270 
there you go guys I just want to show
that<00:03:08.060> it<00:03:08.420> we've<00:03:08.510> got<00:03:08.660> to<00:03:08.920> just<00:03:09.920> a<00:03:10.010> little<00:03:10.070> bit

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.280 
that it we've got to just a little bit

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.160 
that it we've got to just a little bit
over<00:03:10.489> hundred<00:03:11.030> and<00:03:11.180> ninety<00:03:11.540> degrees<00:03:11.840> on<00:03:12.019> this

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170 
over hundred and ninety degrees on this

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:15.819 
over hundred and ninety degrees on this
thing<00:03:12.820> and<00:03:13.820> it's<00:03:14.030> still<00:03:14.600> burning<00:03:14.870> away<00:03:15.230> nicely

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:15.829 
thing and it's still burning away nicely

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:22.150 
thing and it's still burning away nicely
in<00:03:15.950> there<00:03:17.170> so<00:03:19.239> the<00:03:20.239> proof<00:03:20.450> has<00:03:20.660> it<00:03:20.840> there<00:03:21.160> this

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:22.160 
in there so the proof has it there this

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.610 
in there so the proof has it there this
thing<00:03:22.400> really<00:03:22.609> does<00:03:22.790> work<00:03:23.350> give<00:03:24.350> it<00:03:24.470> a<00:03:24.500> try

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:24.620 
thing really does work give it a try

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:28.330 
thing really does work give it a try
guys<00:03:24.920> and<00:03:26.140> if<00:03:27.140> there's<00:03:27.380> any<00:03:27.530> good<00:03:27.650> tier<00:03:27.950> please

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:28.340 
guys and if there's any good tier please
