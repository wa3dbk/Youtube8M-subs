for climate change a lot of the findings
were<00:02:25.070> based<00:02:25.310> on<00:02:25.489> satellite<00:02:25.730> data<00:02:26.200> we

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
were based on satellite data we

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.320 
were based on satellite data we
investigated<00:02:28.040> principal<00:02:28.640> processes<00:02:29.180> with

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.330 
investigated principal processes with

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:30.940 
investigated principal processes with
the<00:02:29.450> scientific<00:02:29.959> mission<00:02:30.260> and<00:02:30.410> then<00:02:30.590> we<00:02:30.769> get

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
the scientific mission and then we get

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:32.620 
the scientific mission and then we get
the<00:02:31.070> operational<00:02:31.640> data<00:02:31.850> over<00:02:32.209> a<00:02:32.239> long<00:02:32.390> time

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:32.630 
the operational data over a long time

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:35.140 
the operational data over a long time
frame<00:02:32.959> so<00:02:33.410> we<00:02:33.560> said<00:02:33.769> we<00:02:33.920> see<00:02:34.220> what<00:02:34.820> is<00:02:35.000> really

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
frame so we said we see what is really

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.479 
frame so we said we see what is really
happening<00:02:35.330> and<00:02:35.989> it's<00:02:36.140> not<00:02:36.290> modeling<00:02:36.739> it's<00:02:36.980> to

00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:37.489 
happening and it's not modeling it's to

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:39.840 
happening and it's not modeling it's to
see<00:02:37.670> what<00:02:37.910> is<00:02:38.090> happening<00:02:38.269> on<00:02:38.900> this<00:02:39.050> planet

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:39.850 
see what is happening on this planet

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:42.490 
see what is happening on this planet
