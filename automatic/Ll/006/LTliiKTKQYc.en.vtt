00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
a way where it could go up and down and

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.719 
a way where it could go up and down and
put<00:01:27.390> it<00:01:27.479> at<00:01:27.570> risk<00:01:27.869> but<00:01:28.829> I<00:01:28.890> do<00:01:29.009> want<00:01:29.400> to<00:01:29.430> earn<00:01:29.610> as

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
put it at risk but I do want to earn as

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.370 
put it at risk but I do want to earn as
much<00:01:29.880> interest<00:01:30.240> as<00:01:30.420> I<00:01:30.509> can<00:01:30.720> in<00:01:30.840> the<00:01:30.930> mean<00:01:31.110> time
