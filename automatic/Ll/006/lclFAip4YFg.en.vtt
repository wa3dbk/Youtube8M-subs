00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:25.980
 hello everyone today I bring you a trick to 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:28.439
 dead rising 2 case zero this game good 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.239
 I was recording it on xbox these recorded 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.430
 on xbox I do not know if this game is for the 

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:34.680
 play 3 the truth I have no idea why 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.820
 that's not the normal dead rising 2 is the 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.950
 case zero this one 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:41.170
 and good 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:42.670
 this is good xbox will also serve to 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:44.610
 the play in case the game is in 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:46.930
 the play is worth it because it is not a trick that 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.850
 have nothing to do between a console and 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:50.500
 the other is valid if the game is for the 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:52.710
 play will be the same what I'm not 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:56.010
 sure that this game is 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.270
 but not now here you will see that I have 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.160
 to do a little the fool not to kill 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.230
 a few zombies to take away a 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.360
 little pressure not because if there's no 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.769
 many there are too many zombies around here and 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:07.080
 Sometimes they do not leave you alone, do not do it 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.600
 but good now you will see that super 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.600
 simple to leave the map 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.909
 and the trick is for one is to paste 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:18.509
 jumps do not have to come to this 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:20.520
 piece of here you have to jump but not 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:22.080
 towards the straight part so there's like 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:26.450
 green but towards the part that protrudes 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:29.149
 let's say the visor is worth simply 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:31.670
 jump and you'll be up here then you 

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:34.939
 skip to this visser and every here or this 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:36.259
 awning or wood this here and 

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:38.509
 then you have to jump but 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:41.030
 directly upwards as if towards 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:42.710
 the wall and you'll get up here this already 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:44.990
 It is inaccessible supposed to here already 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:48.079
 as if we were outside the map it's worth 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:49.670
 yes you can catch some drink for 

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:51.799
 have a little life for because then 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.329
 when jumping out we will lose a bit of 

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:56.030
 life then his thing is to have a little 

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:59.119
 something does not stop to be able to not 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:02.030
 we're worth, and when we're here, 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:04.179
 we already jump is the last jump now 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:07.390
 it only remains to let us fall off the map 

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:10.610
 ok but when we fall outside the map 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:12.769
 this game limits the living 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:14.420
 off the map then there as you see the 

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:17.299
 difference of colors not of the textures 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.890
 let's continue there we will fall to the void but 

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:21.200
 it's not like in the call of duty that you fall 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:23.030
 to vacuum and never moles here when 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.340
 you fall to the emptiness directly the game you 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.490
 get inside the map no and here you have to 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:29.260
 pay about two jumps 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:31.330
 you have to pay two jumps to be able 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:33.610
 go out if you do not want to vacuum like 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:36.040
 I was saying before it's worth yes or here 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:38.440
 it appears that the zombies are there or are 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.510
 to see how I explain it there is no wall 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.890
 invisible as the call of duty is worth not 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:44.110
 there is a wall there is no wall 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:46.750
 you can simply re-enter 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:50.110
 the map but you will fall into the void and it will make you 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:52.080
 to put inside the map automatically 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:54.730
 the game does it alone 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:56.160
 and well here, as you can see, we are already 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:03:00.850
 off the map we are not here 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:04.240
 Running walking is worth and good now 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:06.910
 you will see that he came to the bridge and I get on 

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:09.819
 I'm out there on the outside it does not have 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:11.590
 more secret the trick of this one 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:13.569
 and well now you will see that it is out there 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:16.749
 I'm going to leave the comment here 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:17.709
 I'll play some music and hope that you 

00:03:16.749 --> 00:03:19.420

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:22.610

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:25.150

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:25.150

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.880

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:19.630
