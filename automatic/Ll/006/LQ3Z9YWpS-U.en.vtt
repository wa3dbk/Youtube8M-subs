the more development stage this is not
working<00:00:10.469> quite<00:00:10.860> it<00:00:11.759> should<00:00:12.059> be<00:00:12.179> that<00:00:12.330> here

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
working quite it should be that here

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.779 
working quite it should be that here
let's<00:00:13.410> get<00:00:15.710> oil<00:00:16.710> painters<00:00:17.250> do<00:00:17.400> this<00:00:17.580> all<00:00:17.760> the

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
time this whole ragging out business and

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.189 
time this whole ragging out business and
it<00:00:20.730> used<00:00:20.939> to<00:00:21.090> be<00:00:21.180> the<00:00:21.300> only<00:00:21.480> open<00:00:21.900> interest

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:23.750 
it used to be the only open interest
could<00:00:22.410> do<00:00:22.560> that<00:00:22.650> and<00:00:22.830> poor<00:00:23.039> acrylic<00:00:23.400> features

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.450 
could do that and poor acrylic features
couldn't<00:00:24.119> because<00:00:24.980> you<00:00:25.980> couldn't<00:00:26.310> really

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
couldn't because you couldn't really

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:37.730

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:10.759 
will be the clouds and the waterway at

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:16.300 
will be the clouds and the waterway at
this<00:02:10.910> nice<00:02:11.120> guess<00:02:11.920> this<00:02:13.180> nice<00:02:14.709> flow<00:02:15.709> through

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
this nice guess this nice flow through

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:20.080 
this nice guess this nice flow through
the<00:02:16.400> composition<00:02:17.000> I<00:02:17.230> have<00:02:18.230> this<00:02:19.190> which<00:02:19.790> keeps

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
the composition I have this which keeps

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:22.330 
the composition I have this which keeps
the<00:02:20.330> viewers<00:02:20.660> eye<00:02:20.840> from<00:02:21.260> wandering<00:02:21.890> out<00:02:22.190> of

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
the viewers eye from wandering out of

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.089 
the viewers eye from wandering out of
the<00:02:22.430> painting<00:02:22.879> to<00:02:23.120> the<00:02:24.080> painting<00:02:24.530> mix<00:02:24.799> to<00:02:25.010> it

00:02:25.089 --> 00:02:25.099 
the painting to the painting mix to it

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:27.100 
the painting to the painting mix to it
you're<00:02:25.280> gonna<00:02:25.370> show<00:02:25.790> or<00:02:26.000> whatever<00:02:26.180> I<00:02:26.540> need<00:02:26.959> to

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
you're gonna show or whatever I need to

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:30.039 
you're gonna show or whatever I need to
keep<00:02:27.290> my<00:02:27.349> viewer<00:02:27.860> keep<00:02:28.459> going<00:02:28.879> through<00:02:29.840> the

00:02:30.039 --> 00:02:30.049 
keep my viewer keep going through the

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:32.410 
keep my viewer keep going through the
painting<00:02:30.410> so<00:02:30.920> the<00:02:31.459> idea<00:02:31.579> is<00:02:31.879> to<00:02:32.000> have<00:02:32.120> them

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
painting so the idea is to have them

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:35.289 
painting so the idea is to have them
enter<00:02:32.629> in<00:02:32.989> one<00:02:33.980> ways<00:02:34.220> and<00:02:34.519> pathways<00:02:34.970> and

00:02:35.289 --> 00:02:35.299 
enter in one ways and pathways and

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:39.759 
enter in one ways and pathways and
roadways<00:02:37.030> make<00:02:38.030> great<00:02:38.329> entrances<00:02:38.900> into<00:02:39.140> your

00:02:39.759 --> 00:02:39.769 
roadways make great entrances into your

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:42.190

through so they enter here they'll be

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:52.780 
through so they enter here they'll be
interesting<00:02:52.069> reflections<00:02:52.579> in<00:02:52.700> the<00:02:52.730> water

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
interesting reflections in the water

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:56.199 
interesting reflections in the water
there<00:02:53.540> will<00:02:53.840> be<00:02:54.079> light<00:02:54.500> here<00:02:55.280> and<00:02:55.519> they'll

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:56.209 
there will be light here and they'll

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:58.870 
there will be light here and they'll
draw<00:02:56.510> the<00:02:56.569> viewers<00:02:57.049> eye<00:02:57.280> lit<00:02:58.280> then<00:02:58.549> they'll<00:02:58.730> go

00:03:03.339 --> 00:03:03.349 
texture and things going on here they'll

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:06.160 
texture and things going on here they'll
hit<00:03:03.620> the<00:03:03.650> clouds<00:03:04.389> which<00:03:05.389> will<00:03:05.569> curve<00:03:05.840> back

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.170 
hit the clouds which will curve back

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:08.440 
hit the clouds which will curve back
down<00:03:06.470> and<00:03:06.889> drop<00:03:07.430> them<00:03:07.609> back<00:03:07.819> down<00:03:08.060> here<00:03:08.299> this

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
down and drop them back down here this

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:10.089 
down and drop them back down here this
will<00:03:08.660> keep<00:03:08.870> them<00:03:09.079> in<00:03:09.169> the<00:03:09.260> painting<00:03:09.620> and<00:03:10.040> the

00:03:10.089 --> 00:03:10.099 
will keep them in the painting and the

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:12.909 
will keep them in the painting and the
AA<00:03:10.190> will<00:03:10.700> be<00:03:10.819> able<00:03:10.910> to<00:03:11.060> go<00:03:11.269> in<00:03:11.480> and<00:03:11.709> move<00:03:12.709> all

00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:12.919 
AA will be able to go in and move all

00:03:12.919 --> 00:03:15.909 
AA will be able to go in and move all
around<00:03:13.190> and<00:03:13.549> hopefully<00:03:13.790> at<00:03:14.750> every<00:03:15.049> point<00:03:15.680> in

00:03:15.909 --> 00:03:15.919 
around and hopefully at every point in

00:03:15.919 --> 00:03:17.500 
around and hopefully at every point in
every<00:03:16.099> juncture<00:03:16.579> where<00:03:16.760> they<00:03:16.910> stop<00:03:17.269> they'll

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.510 
every juncture where they stop they'll

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:19.870 
every juncture where they stop they'll
be<00:03:17.630> interesting<00:03:18.109> things<00:03:18.380> for<00:03:19.220> the<00:03:19.310> viewer<00:03:19.549> to

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:19.880 
be interesting things for the viewer to

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:23.199 
be interesting things for the viewer to
look<00:03:20.239> at<00:03:20.419> so<00:03:21.079> that's<00:03:21.319> the<00:03:22.220> idea<00:03:22.579> and<00:03:22.790> this<00:03:23.180> this

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:23.209 
look at so that's the idea and this this

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:27.370 
look at so that's the idea and this this
to<00:03:23.720> this<00:03:23.930> gateway<00:03:24.200> kind<00:03:24.799> of<00:03:24.889> idea<00:03:25.190> is<00:03:26.380> partisan

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:27.380 
to this gateway kind of idea is partisan

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:29.470 
to this gateway kind of idea is partisan
doing<00:03:27.709> that<00:03:27.859> forever<00:03:28.069> and<00:03:28.459> I'm<00:03:28.910> looking<00:03:29.299> at

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480 
doing that forever and I'm looking at

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:31.990 
doing that forever and I'm looking at
this<00:03:29.599> thinking<00:03:29.900> that<00:03:30.230> I<00:03:30.639> might<00:03:31.639> like

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.000 
this thinking that I might like

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:38.170 
this thinking that I might like
something<00:03:35.889> theory<00:03:36.889> so<00:03:37.519> now<00:03:37.669> we're<00:03:37.849> really<00:03:38.000> in

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:38.180 
something theory so now we're really in

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:42.370 
something theory so now we're really in
now<00:03:38.930> there's<00:03:39.139> relief<00:03:40.060> no<00:03:41.060> escape<00:03:41.450> now<00:03:42.230> we're

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:42.380 
now there's relief no escape now we're

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:43.990 
now there's relief no escape now we're
like<00:03:42.470> well<00:03:42.919> you<00:03:43.010> don't<00:03:43.190> really<00:03:43.370> want<00:03:43.700> but<00:03:43.910> you

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:44.000 
like well you don't really want but you

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.069 
like well you don't really want but you
don't<00:03:44.150> want<00:03:44.299> your<00:03:44.359> you<00:03:44.480> were<00:03:44.540> to<00:03:44.630> feel<00:03:44.750> trapped

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:45.079 
don't want your you were to feel trapped

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:47.050 
don't want your you were to feel trapped
and<00:03:45.260> that<00:03:45.410> does<00:03:45.590> happen<00:03:45.799> sometimes<00:03:46.099> sometimes

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.060 
and that does happen sometimes sometimes

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:48.190 
and that does happen sometimes sometimes
you<00:03:47.120> look<00:03:47.239> at<00:03:47.359> the<00:03:47.419> painting<00:03:47.750> it'll<00:03:47.900> make<00:03:48.079> you

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:48.200

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:50.180 
feel very uncomfortable it's not a

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:52.210 
feel very uncomfortable it's not a
pleasant<00:03:50.480> though<00:03:51.049> it's<00:03:51.230> well<00:03:51.410> executed<00:03:51.440> and

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:52.220 
pleasant though it's well executed and

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:54.400 
pleasant though it's well executed and
the<00:03:52.310> colors<00:03:52.940> are<00:03:53.090> finding<00:03:53.450> people<00:03:53.780> is

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:54.410 
the colors are finding people is

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:56.110 
the colors are finding people is
wrong<00:03:54.620> with<00:03:54.770> his<00:03:54.890> pain<00:03:55.100> that<00:03:55.310> I<00:03:55.370> don't<00:03:55.610> like<00:03:55.850> it

wrong with his pain that I don't like it

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:57.880 
wrong with his pain that I don't like it
it's<00:03:56.630> because<00:03:56.870> you're<00:03:57.170> trapped<00:03:57.560> in<00:03:57.770> the

00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:57.890 
it's because you're trapped in the

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:00.010 
it's because you're trapped in the
painting<00:03:58.340> so<00:03:58.880> this<00:03:59.030> painting<00:03:59.390> has<00:03:59.420> a<00:03:59.540> way<00:03:59.750> Anna

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:00.020 
painting so this painting has a way Anna

painting so this painting has a way Anna
it<00:04:00.890> has<00:04:01.160> a<00:04:01.190> way<00:04:01.400> to<00:04:01.460> guide<00:04:01.700> you<00:04:01.910> through<00:04:02.210> and

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:02.480 
it has a way to guide you through and

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:04.150 
it has a way to guide you through and
because<00:04:03.050> this<00:04:03.260> cloud<00:04:03.500> is<00:04:03.680> going<00:04:03.830> to<00:04:03.890> run<00:04:04.040> off

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:04.160 
because this cloud is going to run off

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:05.410 
because this cloud is going to run off
the<00:04:04.190> top<00:04:04.550> of<00:04:04.580> the<00:04:04.760> painting<00:04:05.030> there's<00:04:05.180> also

that feeling that you could wander out

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:10.570 
that feeling that you could wander out

able<00:06:33.919> to<00:06:34.160> go<00:06:34.220> in<00:06:34.370> and<00:06:34.400> work<00:06:35.150> it<00:06:35.410> and<00:06:36.410> you<00:06:36.530> can

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:36.710 
able to go in and work it and you can

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:37.930 
able to go in and work it and you can
get<00:06:36.800> used<00:06:37.010> to<00:06:37.160> working<00:06:37.340> now<00:06:37.580> that's<00:06:37.760> what<00:06:37.849> my

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:37.940 
get used to working now that's what my

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:39.820 
get used to working now that's what my
oil<00:06:38.120> can<00:06:38.330> friends<00:06:38.690> do<00:06:38.840> that<00:06:39.229> work<00:06:39.410> like<00:06:39.650> this

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:39.830 
oil can friends do that work like this

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:41.890 
oil can friends do that work like this
and<00:06:40.070> that's<00:06:40.669> the<00:06:40.789> tips<00:06:41.090> that<00:06:41.180> they<00:06:41.419> have

00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:41.900 
and that's the tips that they have

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:44.230 
and that's the tips that they have
passed<00:06:42.169> on<00:06:42.410> to<00:06:42.620> me<00:06:42.710> so<00:06:43.400> it's<00:06:43.520> not<00:06:43.639> of<00:06:43.910> course

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:44.240 
passed on to me so it's not of course

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:46.690 
passed on to me so it's not of course

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:20.500 
even smaller anything smaller and even

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:22.080 
even smaller anything smaller and even
smaller<00:07:20.800> linear<00:07:21.220> perspective<00:07:21.430> you<00:07:21.819> can<00:07:21.970> see

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:22.090 
smaller linear perspective you can see

00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:23.939 
smaller linear perspective you can see
that<00:07:22.210> really<00:07:22.449> here<00:07:22.690> you<00:07:23.560> can<00:07:23.680> see<00:07:23.800> the

00:07:23.939 --> 00:07:23.949 
that really here you can see the

00:07:23.949 --> 00:07:25.680 
that really here you can see the
difference<00:07:24.550> in<00:07:24.669> spacing<00:07:25.150> bigger<00:07:25.360> space

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:25.690 
difference in spacing bigger space

00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:28.350 
difference in spacing bigger space
smaller<00:07:26.110> space<00:07:26.530> similar<00:07:27.460> trees<00:07:27.759> but<00:07:28.090> getting

00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:28.360 
smaller space similar trees but getting

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:29.730 
smaller space similar trees but getting
smaller<00:07:28.690> as<00:07:28.840> they<00:07:28.870> go<00:07:29.110> back<00:07:29.259> in<00:07:29.470> here<00:07:29.680> of

00:07:29.730 --> 00:07:29.740 
smaller as they go back in here of

00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:31.529 
smaller as they go back in here of
course<00:07:29.770> just<00:07:30.009> got<00:07:30.220> short<00:07:30.460> tree<00:07:30.669> with<00:07:30.880> all<00:07:31.060> but

00:07:31.529 --> 00:07:31.539 
course just got short tree with all but

00:07:31.539 --> 00:07:33.360 
course just got short tree with all but
the<00:07:31.690> bigger<00:07:31.870> trees<00:07:32.199> are<00:07:32.560> still<00:07:32.889> going<00:07:33.099> back

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:33.370 
the bigger trees are still going back

00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:35.939 
the bigger trees are still going back
and<00:07:33.759> these<00:07:34.449> trees<00:07:34.690> back<00:07:35.020> here<00:07:35.050> even<00:07:35.530> shorter

00:07:35.939 --> 00:07:35.949 
and these trees back here even shorter

00:07:35.949 --> 00:07:37.170 
and these trees back here even shorter
so<00:07:36.130> that<00:07:36.280> helps<00:07:36.550> your<00:07:36.699> linear<00:07:36.940> perspective

00:07:37.170 --> 00:07:37.180 
so that helps your linear perspective

00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:39.659 
so that helps your linear perspective
and<00:07:37.750> just<00:07:38.410> like<00:07:38.530> the<00:07:38.710> road<00:07:38.889> that's<00:07:39.460> the

00:07:39.659 --> 00:07:39.669 
and just like the road that's the

00:07:39.669 --> 00:07:42.960 
and just like the road that's the
overall<00:07:39.970> trapping<00:07:40.570> wider<00:07:41.259> front<00:07:41.770> narrower<00:07:42.669> to

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:42.970 
overall trapping wider front narrower to

00:07:42.970 --> 00:07:46.050 
overall trapping wider front narrower to
the<00:07:43.060> back<00:07:43.270> if<00:07:43.740> you're<00:07:44.740> new<00:07:44.979> to<00:07:45.400> drawing<00:07:45.759> and

00:07:46.050 --> 00:07:46.060 
the back if you're new to drawing and

00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:47.999 
the back if you're new to drawing and
painting<00:07:46.270> most<00:07:47.199> people<00:07:47.530> don't<00:07:47.620> make<00:07:47.770> this

00:07:47.999 --> 00:07:48.009 
painting most people don't make this

00:07:48.009 --> 00:07:50.219 
painting most people don't make this
right<00:07:48.460> enough<00:07:48.759> they<00:07:48.909> don't<00:07:49.090> realize<00:07:49.449> how<00:07:49.479> why

00:07:50.219 --> 00:07:50.229 
right enough they don't realize how why

00:07:50.229 --> 00:07:53.879 
right enough they don't realize how why
this<00:07:50.680> needs<00:07:51.070> to<00:07:51.190> be<00:07:51.360> here<00:07:52.360> to<00:07:52.560> make<00:07:53.560> sense

00:07:53.879 --> 00:07:53.889 
this needs to be here to make sense

00:07:53.889 --> 00:07:55.469 
this needs to be here to make sense
going<00:07:54.159> back<00:07:54.490> and<00:07:54.729> that's<00:07:54.789> one<00:07:55.090> of<00:07:55.180> the<00:07:55.240> reasons

00:07:55.469 --> 00:07:55.479 
going back and that's one of the reasons

00:07:55.479 --> 00:07:57.120 
going back and that's one of the reasons
this<00:07:55.690> is<00:07:55.750> too<00:07:56.050> narrow<00:07:56.229> the<00:07:56.500> whole<00:07:56.680> thing<00:07:56.919> kind

00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:57.130 
this is too narrow the whole thing kind

00:07:57.130 --> 00:07:59.189 
this is too narrow the whole thing kind
of<00:07:57.280> flips<00:07:57.550> up<00:07:57.729> at<00:07:57.970> you<00:07:58.180> and<00:07:58.389> you<00:07:58.840> don't<00:07:58.990> get

00:07:59.189 --> 00:07:59.199 
of flips up at you and you don't get

00:07:59.199 --> 00:08:00.899 
of flips up at you and you don't get
that<00:07:59.259> convincing<00:07:59.949> sense<00:08:00.190> that<00:08:00.400> is<00:08:00.490> laying<00:08:00.759> on

00:08:00.899 --> 00:08:00.909 
that convincing sense that is laying on

00:08:00.909 --> 00:08:04.379 
that convincing sense that is laying on
the<00:08:00.970> ground<00:08:01.210> going<00:08:01.960> back<00:08:02.289> in<00:08:02.560> space<00:08:03.330> okay<00:08:04.330> so

00:08:04.379 --> 00:08:04.389 
the ground going back in space okay so

00:08:04.389 --> 00:08:08.909 
the ground going back in space okay so
now<00:08:05.400> we<00:08:06.400> are<00:08:06.520> ready<00:08:06.610> to<00:08:06.699> paint
