hey<00:00:18.730> guys<00:00:18.970> today's<00:00:19.570> video<00:00:19.840> will<00:00:20.170> be<00:00:20.289> in

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:20.380 
hey guys today's video will be in

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:22.259 
hey guys today's video will be in
creating<00:00:20.800> a<00:00:20.919> basic<00:00:21.160> circle<00:00:21.669> skirt<00:00:21.880> pattern

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:22.269 
creating a basic circle skirt pattern

00:00:22.269 --> 00:00:24.330 
creating a basic circle skirt pattern
this<00:00:22.810> will<00:00:23.019> be<00:00:23.169> the<00:00:23.289> last<00:00:23.439> basic<00:00:23.949> skirt

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:24.340 
this will be the last basic skirt

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:26.550 
this will be the last basic skirt
pattern<00:00:24.759> for<00:00:25.000> now<00:00:25.119> I'll<00:00:25.720> be<00:00:25.989> going<00:00:26.230> over<00:00:26.349> the

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:26.560 
pattern for now I'll be going over the

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.260 
pattern for now I'll be going over the
equipment<00:00:26.890> and<00:00:26.949> materials<00:00:27.009> we<00:00:27.550> need<00:00:27.579> as<00:00:28.000> well

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:28.270 
equipment and materials we need as well

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:29.760 
equipment and materials we need as well
as<00:00:28.329> a<00:00:28.449> few<00:00:28.720> measurements<00:00:29.230> we'll<00:00:29.320> be<00:00:29.410> needing

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:29.770 
as a few measurements we'll be needing

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:35.920 
as a few measurements we'll be needing
and<00:00:29.949> then<00:00:30.579> we'll<00:00:30.699> just<00:00:30.880> get<00:00:31.029> started

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:35.930 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:38.380 

so<00:00:36.590> for<00:00:36.770> the<00:00:36.890> equipment<00:00:37.100> and<00:00:37.310> materials<00:00:37.790> we'll

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:38.390 
so for the equipment and materials we'll

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:46.030 
so for the equipment and materials we'll
need<00:00:38.660> a<00:00:39.080> roll<00:00:39.980> of<00:00:40.130> paper<00:00:40.430> a<00:00:41.680> ruler<00:00:42.680> a<00:00:45.010> pair<00:00:46.010> of

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:46.040 
need a roll of paper a ruler a pair of

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:50.869 
need a roll of paper a ruler a pair of
scissors<00:00:46.340> a<00:00:47.950> pen

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
scissors a pen

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.939 
scissors a pen
another<00:00:51.600> pen

00:00:53.939 --> 00:00:53.949 

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:56.520 

and<00:00:54.039> two<00:00:54.670> measuring<00:00:54.969> tapes<00:00:55.300> the<00:00:55.989> second<00:00:56.379> one

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:56.530 
and two measuring tapes the second one

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:58.740 
and two measuring tapes the second one
can<00:00:56.800> be<00:00:56.859> an<00:00:57.070> old<00:00:57.280> one<00:00:57.579> as<00:00:57.789> you're<00:00:58.539> going<00:00:58.659> to

00:00:58.740 --> 00:00:58.750 
can be an old one as you're going to

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:04.149 
can be an old one as you're going to
need<00:00:58.929> to<00:00:59.050> put<00:00:59.289> a<00:00:59.440> hole<00:00:59.679> in<00:00:59.829> it

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:04.159 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:06.190 

the<00:01:04.580> first<00:01:04.790> measurement<00:01:05.180> you'll<00:01:05.479> need<00:01:05.690> is<00:01:05.930> the

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:06.200 
the first measurement you'll need is the

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.260 
the first measurement you'll need is the
waist<00:01:06.380> measurements<00:01:07.220> so<00:01:07.670> measure<00:01:07.880> around<00:01:08.060> the

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:08.270 
waist measurements so measure around the

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:10.359 
waist measurements so measure around the
smallest<00:01:08.659> part<00:01:09.020> of<00:01:09.080> your<00:01:09.140> body<00:01:09.409> and<00:01:10.100> write

00:01:10.359 --> 00:01:10.369 
smallest part of your body and write

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:12.969 
smallest part of your body and write
that<00:01:10.550> down<00:01:10.610> as<00:01:11.479> we<00:01:11.810> will<00:01:12.050> be<00:01:12.170> using<00:01:12.409> that<00:01:12.740> for

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:12.979 
that down as we will be using that for

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:17.609 
that down as we will be using that for
the<00:01:13.010> next<00:01:13.190> two<00:01:13.520> measurements

00:01:17.609 --> 00:01:17.619 

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:19.930 

so<00:01:18.619> first<00:01:18.860> we'll<00:01:19.010> divide<00:01:19.369> that<00:01:19.580> measurement

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:19.940 
so first we'll divide that measurement

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:23.499 
so first we'll divide that measurement
by<00:01:20.240> four<00:01:20.570> and<00:01:20.840> then<00:01:21.460> we'll<00:01:22.460> add<00:01:22.640> three<00:01:23.210> point

00:01:23.499 --> 00:01:23.509 
by four and then we'll add three point

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:26.530 
by four and then we'll add three point
five<00:01:23.720> centimeters<00:01:24.850> that<00:01:25.850> will<00:01:26.000> be<00:01:26.180> your<00:01:26.330> waist

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:26.540 
five centimeters that will be your waist

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:28.960 
five centimeters that will be your waist
width<00:01:26.869> measurement<00:01:27.440> then<00:01:27.920> we'll<00:01:28.130> divide<00:01:28.280> the

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:28.970 
width measurement then we'll divide the

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:30.910 
width measurement then we'll divide the
written<00:01:29.300> down<00:01:29.479> measurement<00:01:30.080> by<00:01:30.320> six<00:01:30.590> point

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:30.920 
written down measurement by six point

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.940 
written down measurement by six point
two<00:01:31.220> eight<00:01:31.250> and<00:01:31.899> that<00:01:32.899> will<00:01:33.050> be<00:01:33.200> your<00:01:33.350> waist<00:01:33.560> x

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:33.950 
two eight and that will be your waist x

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:36.460 
two eight and that will be your waist x
measurement<00:01:34.550> lastly<00:01:35.450> will<00:01:35.600> be<00:01:35.720> waist<00:01:35.960> or<00:01:36.259> hip

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:36.470 
measurement lastly will be waist or hip

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:39.100 
measurement lastly will be waist or hip
to<00:01:36.649> desired<00:01:37.039> length<00:01:37.539> we'll<00:01:38.539> call<00:01:38.810> that<00:01:38.930> the

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:39.110 
to desired length we'll call that the

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:40.960 
to desired length we'll call that the
full<00:01:39.259> length<00:01:39.560> and<00:01:39.830> add<00:01:40.100> three<00:01:40.550> point<00:01:40.789> five

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:40.970 
full length and add three point five

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:43.690 
full length and add three point five
centimeters<00:01:41.770> next<00:01:42.770> add<00:01:42.920> your<00:01:42.979> full<00:01:43.490> length

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:43.700 
centimeters next add your full length

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.999 
centimeters next add your full length
measurement<00:01:44.270> to<00:01:44.660> your<00:01:44.869> waist<00:01:45.080> X<00:01:45.440> measurement

00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:46.009 
measurement to your waist X measurement

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:58.030 
measurement to your waist X measurement
and<00:01:46.250> we'll<00:01:46.970> call<00:01:47.179> that<00:01:47.509> measurement<00:01:47.960> y

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:58.040 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:59.980 

okay<00:01:58.850> guys<00:01:59.060> are<00:01:59.300> going<00:01:59.420> to<00:01:59.480> set<00:01:59.660> off<00:01:59.780> first

00:01:59.980 --> 00:01:59.990 
okay guys are going to set off first

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:05.080 
okay guys are going to set off first
with<00:02:00.290> the<00:02:00.920> front<00:02:01.280> of<00:02:01.370> the<00:02:01.460> Srpska<00:02:03.670> I'm<00:02:04.670> going

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 
with the front of the Srpska I'm going

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:07.200 
with the front of the Srpska I'm going
to<00:02:05.180> use<00:02:05.390> candles<00:02:05.870> to<00:02:06.110> help<00:02:06.290> hold<00:02:06.560> down<00:02:06.800> a<00:02:06.830> paper

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:07.210 
to use candles to help hold down a paper

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:09.700 
to use candles to help hold down a paper
you<00:02:08.210> can<00:02:08.390> use<00:02:08.420> other<00:02:08.810> weights<00:02:09.110> if<00:02:09.350> you<00:02:09.500> need

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:09.710 
you can use other weights if you need

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:11.980 
you can use other weights if you need
make<00:02:10.399> sure<00:02:10.430> your<00:02:10.820> paper<00:02:11.000> roll<00:02:11.330> can<00:02:11.570> fit<00:02:11.840> your
