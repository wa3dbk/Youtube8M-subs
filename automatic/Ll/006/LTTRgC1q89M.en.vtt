00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.370 

all<00:00:06.190> right<00:00:06.580> like<00:00:06.790> all<00:00:06.910> Seymour<00:00:07.270> Duncan<00:00:07.510> pedals

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:08.380 
all right like all Seymour Duncan pedals

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:09.869 
all right like all Seymour Duncan pedals
this<00:00:08.530> digital<00:00:08.920> delay<00:00:09.129> isn't<00:00:09.460> the<00:00:09.520> prettiest

00:00:09.869 --> 00:00:09.879 
this digital delay isn't the prettiest

00:00:09.879 --> 00:00:11.520 
this digital delay isn't the prettiest
but<00:00:10.420> suc<00:00:10.900> it's<00:00:11.020> got<00:00:11.139> some<00:00:11.230> pretty<00:00:11.350> great

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:11.530 
but suc it's got some pretty great

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:13.200 
but suc it's got some pretty great
features<00:00:11.950> so<00:00:12.219> let's<00:00:12.340> check<00:00:12.700> it<00:00:12.730> cool<00:00:13.000> so<00:00:13.179> let's

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:13.210 
features so let's check it cool so let's

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:14.970 
features so let's check it cool so let's
a<00:00:13.420> quick<00:00:13.599> look<00:00:13.780> at<00:00:13.870> the<00:00:13.929> features<00:00:14.290> we've<00:00:14.740> got

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:14.980 
a quick look at the features we've got

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:17.730 
a quick look at the features we've got
bypass<00:00:15.429> and<00:00:15.790> you<00:00:16.180> can<00:00:16.330> decide<00:00:16.630> when<00:00:17.349> it's<00:00:17.500> off

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:17.740 
bypass and you can decide when it's off

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:19.109 
bypass and you can decide when it's off
or<00:00:17.980> on<00:00:18.130> whether<00:00:18.430> when<00:00:18.640> it<00:00:18.730> comes<00:00:18.880> back<00:00:19.060> on

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:19.119 
or on whether when it comes back on

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:21.150 
or on whether when it comes back on
whether<00:00:19.750> you<00:00:19.840> want<00:00:19.960> to<00:00:20.020> have<00:00:20.080> true<00:00:20.380> bypass<00:00:20.829> or

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:21.160 
whether you want to have true bypass or

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:23.429 
whether you want to have true bypass or
trailing<00:00:21.550> repeats<00:00:21.910> and<00:00:22.119> it<00:00:22.239> just<00:00:22.419> means<00:00:22.630> if

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:23.439 
trailing repeats and it just means if

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:24.659 
trailing repeats and it just means if
you're<00:00:23.560> playing<00:00:23.770> something<00:00:24.160> it<00:00:24.250> repeats<00:00:24.520> will

00:00:24.659 --> 00:00:24.669 
you're playing something it repeats will

00:00:24.669 --> 00:00:26.639 
you're playing something it repeats will
carry<00:00:24.910> on<00:00:25.119> into<00:00:25.419> whatever<00:00:26.349> you're<00:00:26.470> playing

00:00:26.639 --> 00:00:26.649 
carry on into whatever you're playing

00:00:26.649 --> 00:00:28.260 
carry on into whatever you're playing
long<00:00:27.279> after<00:00:27.550> you've<00:00:27.700> turned<00:00:27.880> it<00:00:27.970> off<00:00:28.059> you've

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:28.270 
long after you've turned it off you've

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:29.429 
long after you've turned it off you've
got<00:00:28.360> a<00:00:28.390> super<00:00:28.540> long<00:00:28.750> delay<00:00:29.020> on<00:00:29.140> so<00:00:29.349> it<00:00:29.410> doesn't

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:29.439 
got a super long delay on so it doesn't

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:32.159 
got a super long delay on so it doesn't
cut<00:00:29.860> off<00:00:29.950> quick<00:00:30.189> and<00:00:30.480> over<00:00:31.480> here<00:00:31.750> we've<00:00:31.960> got<00:00:31.989> a

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:32.169 
cut off quick and over here we've got a

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:34.799 
cut off quick and over here we've got a
ratio<00:00:32.500> and<00:00:32.890> a<00:00:32.980> delay<00:00:33.220> time<00:00:33.460> and<00:00:33.670> a<00:00:34.300> tip<00:00:34.510> tempo

00:00:34.799 --> 00:00:34.809 
ratio and a delay time and a tip tempo

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:36.180 
ratio and a delay time and a tip tempo
now<00:00:35.260> one<00:00:35.440> of<00:00:35.469> the<00:00:35.590> real<00:00:35.739> cool<00:00:35.890> things<00:00:36.100> about

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:36.190 
now one of the real cool things about

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:38.460 
now one of the real cool things about
this<00:00:36.399> is<00:00:36.610> you<00:00:36.820> can<00:00:36.940> blend<00:00:37.240> your<00:00:37.660> analog<00:00:38.200> and

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:38.470 
this is you can blend your analog and

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:39.780 
this is you can blend your analog and
digital<00:00:38.500> sounds<00:00:39.220> so<00:00:39.340> if<00:00:39.430> you're<00:00:39.580> playing

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:39.790 
digital sounds so if you're playing

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:44.270 
digital sounds so if you're playing
something<00:00:40.000> like<00:00:40.240> this

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:50.280 

you<00:00:45.000> can<00:00:45.210> go<00:00:45.899> for<00:00:46.170> full<00:00:46.440> analog

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:50.290 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:56.270 

a<00:00:50.760> bit<00:00:51.760> of<00:00:51.880> ice

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.340 

and<00:00:57.280> you<00:00:57.520> can<00:00:57.670> also<00:00:57.910> add<00:00:58.240> some<00:00:58.450> modulation<00:00:58.810> so

00:00:59.340 --> 00:00:59.350 
and you can also add some modulation so

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:06.030 
and you can also add some modulation so
as<00:00:59.590> you<00:00:59.800> turn<00:01:00.040> this<00:01:00.400> to<00:01:00.460> the<00:01:00.760> right<00:01:05.040> start

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:06.040 
as you turn this to the right start

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:07.440 
as you turn this to the right start
getting<00:01:06.250> male<00:01:06.430> chorus<00:01:06.760> II<00:01:06.970> things<00:01:07.150> coming

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:07.450 
getting male chorus II things coming

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:12.770 
getting male chorus II things coming
through

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.800 

right<00:01:13.170> through<00:01:13.440> some<00:01:13.650> almost<00:01:14.270> basil<00:01:15.270> is<00:01:15.570> Liam

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
right through some almost basil is Liam

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.150 
right through some almost basil is Liam
type<00:01:16.020> things<00:01:16.230> and<00:01:16.590> of<00:01:16.650> course<00:01:16.890> if<00:01:17.040> you're

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:17.160 
type things and of course if you're

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:21.560 
type things and of course if you're
totally<00:01:17.400> an<00:01:17.520> analog<00:01:19.520> these<00:01:20.520> modulations<00:01:21.120> come

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
totally an analog these modulations come

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.190 
totally an analog these modulations come
through<00:01:21.780> a<00:01:21.840> lot<00:01:21.960> more<00:01:22.200> if<00:01:22.680> you're<00:01:22.890> in<00:01:22.979> digital

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
through a lot more if you're in digital

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.319 
through a lot more if you're in digital
not<00:01:25.680> too<00:01:25.860> much<00:01:26.070> at<00:01:26.219> all<00:01:26.310> watch<00:01:26.490> magazines<00:01:26.939> and

00:01:27.319 --> 00:01:27.329 
not too much at all watch magazines and

00:01:27.329 --> 00:01:29.840 
not too much at all watch magazines and
it<00:01:28.049> features<00:01:28.439> bucket-brigade<00:01:29.100> circuitry

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
it features bucket-brigade circuitry

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.230 
it features bucket-brigade circuitry
which<00:01:30.000> basically<00:01:30.420> means<00:01:30.780> you've<00:01:31.409> just<00:01:31.740> got

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.240 
which basically means you've just got

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.179 
which basically means you've just got
capacitor<00:01:33.240> cascading<00:01:34.049> into<00:01:34.170> capacitor<00:01:34.860> into

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
capacitor cascading into capacitor into

00:01:35.189 --> 00:02:28.910 
capacitor cascading into capacitor into
capacitor<00:01:35.880> which<00:01:36.329> gives<00:01:36.719> you<00:01:40.039> so<00:02:27.319> nice<00:02:28.319> option

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
capacitor which gives you so nice option

00:02:28.920 --> 00:04:09.070 
capacitor which gives you so nice option
warbling<00:02:29.850> stuff<00:02:30.090> in<00:02:30.239> there<00:02:30.799> excellent

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:09.080 

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:11.140 

you
