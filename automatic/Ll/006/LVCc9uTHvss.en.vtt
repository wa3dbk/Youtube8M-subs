00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
these two layers and then go here go to

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:31.360 
these two layers and then go here go to
filter<00:02:22.300> just<00:02:23.300> store<00:02:23.920> that's<00:02:24.920> noise<00:02:28.780> and<00:02:29.780> go<00:02:30.370> to

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
filter just store that's noise and go to

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:33.699 
filter just store that's noise and go to
displace<00:02:31.880> and<00:02:32.270> it's<00:02:33.020> going<00:02:33.140> to<00:02:33.200> bring<00:02:33.320> this<00:02:33.470> up

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:33.709 
displace and it's going to bring this up

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:36.550 
displace and it's going to bring this up
just<00:02:33.770> ignore<00:02:34.280> it<00:02:34.310> just<00:02:34.550> hit<00:02:34.670> okay<00:02:34.940> and<00:02:35.560> then

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560 
just ignore it just hit okay and then

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:37.900 
just ignore it just hit okay and then
pretty<00:02:36.890> much<00:02:37.010> don't<00:02:37.280> change<00:02:37.610> these<00:02:37.880> settings

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:37.910 
pretty much don't change these settings

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
pretty much don't change these settings
here<00:02:38.690> and<00:02:39.160> then<00:02:40.160> just<00:02:40.310> hit<00:02:40.430> okay<00:02:40.840> open<00:02:41.840> the

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
here and then just hit okay open the

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:45.340 
here and then just hit okay open the
file<00:02:42.200> and<00:02:43.239> you<00:02:44.239> see<00:02:44.420> it<00:02:44.510> distorted<00:02:45.020> it<00:02:45.170> to

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:45.350 
file and you see it distorted it to

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:48.970 
file and you see it distorted it to
actually<00:02:45.739> match<00:02:45.890> these<00:02:46.100> contours<00:02:47.560> then<00:02:48.560> one

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
actually match these contours then one

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.610 
actually match these contours then one
change<00:02:49.160> your<00:02:49.280> blood<00:02:49.459> mode<00:02:49.610> to<00:02:49.820> soft<00:02:50.150> light<00:02:50.620> so

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
change your blood mode to soft light so

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:53.710 
change your blood mode to soft light so
it<00:02:52.160> will<00:02:52.340> actually<00:02:52.519> light<00:02:52.910> it<00:02:53.060> correctly<00:02:53.450> you

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 
it will actually light it correctly you

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:55.360 
it will actually light it correctly you
see<00:02:53.870> all<00:02:53.989> these<00:02:54.080> are<00:02:54.260> highlights<00:02:54.920> here<00:02:55.130> I'll

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
see all these are highlights here I'll

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:57.970 
see all these are highlights here I'll
light<00:02:55.610> that<00:02:55.820> correctly<00:02:56.239> I'd<00:02:57.080> say<00:02:57.320> set<00:02:57.590> your

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:57.980 
light that correctly I'd say set your

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:02.560 
light that correctly I'd say set your
opacity<00:02:58.280> to<00:02:59.150> 75<00:03:00.519> or<00:03:01.519> its<00:03:01.730> opacity<00:03:02.000> a<00:03:02.300> little

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:02.570 
opacity to 75 or its opacity a little

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:05.740 
opacity to 75 or its opacity a little
bit<00:03:03.459> then<00:03:04.459> you<00:03:04.489> want<00:03:04.760> to<00:03:04.820> go<00:03:04.880> to<00:03:04.940> filter<00:03:05.450> blur

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:05.750 
bit then you want to go to filter blur

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:08.949 
bit then you want to go to filter blur
and<00:03:06.680> Gaussian<00:03:07.220> blur<00:03:07.580> put<00:03:07.880> about<00:03:08.060> a<00:03:08.120> I<00:03:08.420> don't

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:08.959 
and Gaussian blur put about a I don't

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:14.740 
and Gaussian blur put about a I don't
know<00:03:09.049> for<00:03:09.739> pixel<00:03:10.160> blur<00:03:10.370> on<00:03:10.430> it<00:03:13.450> get<00:03:14.450> a<00:03:14.480> two

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750 
know for pixel blur on it get a two

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:16.420 
know for pixel blur on it get a two
pixel<00:03:15.140> action<00:03:15.530> yeah<00:03:15.890> I<00:03:15.920> put<00:03:16.040> about<00:03:16.190> a<00:03:16.250> two

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.430 
pixel action yeah I put about a two

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:18.340 
pixel action yeah I put about a two
pixel<00:03:16.760> blur<00:03:16.970> on<00:03:17.030> it<00:03:17.329> this<00:03:18.079> is<00:03:18.230> really

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:18.350 
pixel blur on it this is really

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:20.020 
pixel blur on it this is really
experimental<00:03:19.130> it<00:03:19.220> depends<00:03:19.549> on<00:03:19.640> what<00:03:19.820> looks

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.030 
experimental it depends on what looks

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:21.819 
experimental it depends on what looks
good<00:03:20.150> it<00:03:20.450> really<00:03:20.720> depends<00:03:21.170> on<00:03:21.230> the<00:03:21.320> image<00:03:21.590> so<00:03:21.799> I

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:21.829 
good it really depends on the image so I

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:25.420 
good it really depends on the image so I
say<00:03:22.310> put<00:03:22.459> 22<00:03:22.730> maybe<00:03:23.030> for<00:03:23.840> pixel<00:03:24.260> blur<00:03:24.440> just<00:03:25.370> to

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:25.430 
say put 22 maybe for pixel blur just to

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:28.240 
say put 22 maybe for pixel blur just to
soften<00:03:25.670> up<00:03:25.880> those<00:03:26.090> edges<00:03:26.269> and<00:03:26.959> then<00:03:27.860> what<00:03:28.220> a

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
soften up those edges and then what a

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:31.180 
soften up those edges and then what a
little<00:03:28.760> bit<00:03:28.880> of<00:03:28.970> noise<00:03:29.769> so<00:03:30.769> you<00:03:30.890> go<00:03:30.980> to<00:03:31.040> add

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:31.190 
little bit of noise so you go to add

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:35.199 
little bit of noise so you go to add
noise<00:03:31.489> set<00:03:32.060> it<00:03:32.150> to<00:03:32.269> four<00:03:32.720> got<00:03:33.680> a<00:03:33.940> Gaussian<00:03:34.940> and

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:35.209 
noise set it to four got a Gaussian and

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:39.580 
noise set it to four got a Gaussian and
sits<00:03:35.930> about<00:03:36.190> monochrome<00:03:37.190> hit<00:03:37.579> OK<00:03:37.880> and<00:03:38.590> that's

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:39.590 
sits about monochrome hit OK and that's

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:41.380 
sits about monochrome hit OK and that's
pretty<00:03:39.799> much<00:03:39.920> it<00:03:40.040> and<00:03:40.430> you<00:03:40.519> got<00:03:40.670> it<00:03:40.730> you<00:03:41.269> got

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:41.390 
pretty much it and you got it you got

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:43.289 
pretty much it and you got it you got
this<00:03:41.570> tattoo<00:03:41.780> here<00:03:42.170> that<00:03:42.320> looks<00:03:42.530> pretty<00:03:42.920> cool

00:03:43.289 --> 00:03:43.299 
this tattoo here that looks pretty cool

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:46.090 
this tattoo here that looks pretty cool
now<00:03:44.299> the<00:03:44.360> thing<00:03:44.630> is<00:03:44.660> you<00:03:45.110> once<00:03:45.560> you<00:03:45.709> do<00:03:45.829> it<00:03:45.950> this

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:46.100 
now the thing is you once you do it this

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:48.490 
now the thing is you once you do it this
way<00:03:46.340> you<00:03:46.400> can't<00:03:46.820> move<00:03:47.120> it<00:03:47.420> on<00:03:47.630> that<00:03:47.900> but<00:03:48.350> you

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:48.500 
way you can't move it on that but you

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:50.110 
way you can't move it on that but you
can't<00:03:48.680> move<00:03:48.799> it<00:03:48.950> because<00:03:49.100> if<00:03:49.220> you<00:03:49.340> do<00:03:49.519> the

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:50.120 
can't move it because if you do the

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.840 
can't move it because if you do the
distortion<00:03:50.660> will<00:03:50.750> be<00:03:50.870> off<00:03:51.019> so<00:03:51.430> make<00:03:52.430> sure<00:03:52.459> you

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:52.850 
distortion will be off so make sure you

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:56.199 
distortion will be off so make sure you
place<00:03:53.150> it<00:03:54.280> you<00:03:55.280> like<00:03:55.489> that<00:03:55.519> positioning

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:56.209 
place it you like that positioning

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:57.490 
place it you like that positioning
because<00:03:56.420> if<00:03:56.570> you<00:03:56.750> want<00:03:56.930> to<00:03:57.049> remove<00:03:57.260> it<00:03:57.410> you

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:57.500 
because if you want to remove it you

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:58.660 
because if you want to remove it you
have<00:03:57.650> to<00:03:57.799> do<00:03:57.890> the<00:03:58.010> whole<00:03:58.040> thing<00:03:58.190> over<00:03:58.489> again

00:03:58.660 --> 00:03:58.670 
have to do the whole thing over again

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:01.270 
have to do the whole thing over again
but<00:03:59.420> uh<00:03:59.480> yeah<00:04:00.200> that's<00:04:00.560> pretty<00:04:00.829> much<00:04:01.010> how<00:04:01.220> you

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:01.280 
but uh yeah that's pretty much how you

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:04.930 
but uh yeah that's pretty much how you
uh<00:04:01.480> itit<00:04:02.480> a<00:04:02.690> 22<00:04:03.019> a<00:04:03.049> body<00:04:03.290> part<00:04:03.560> and<00:04:03.860> it<00:04:04.549> should

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:04.940 
uh itit a 22 a body part and it should

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:07.659 
uh itit a 22 a body part and it should
work<00:04:04.970> for<00:04:05.329> almost<00:04:05.570> any<00:04:06.100> it<00:04:07.100> should<00:04:07.430> this

00:04:07.659 --> 00:04:07.669 
work for almost any it should this

00:04:07.669 --> 00:04:09.520 
work for almost any it should this
should<00:04:07.850> work<00:04:07.880> for<00:04:08.209> our<00:04:08.329> arms<00:04:08.690> legs<00:04:08.959> any<00:04:09.290> part

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:09.530 
should work for our arms legs any part

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:11.470 
should work for our arms legs any part
of<00:04:09.560> the<00:04:09.650> body<00:04:09.799> the<00:04:10.190> face<00:04:10.850> might<00:04:11.120> be<00:04:11.269> a<00:04:11.299> little

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:11.480 
of the body the face might be a little

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:12.460 
of the body the face might be a little
bit<00:04:11.690> differently

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:12.470 
bit differently

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:14.830 
bit differently
ki<00:04:12.620> but<00:04:12.970> yeah<00:04:13.970> that's<00:04:14.120> how<00:04:14.270> you<00:04:14.330> out<00:04:14.480> of<00:04:14.570> tattoo

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:14.840 
ki but yeah that's how you out of tattoo

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:17.500 
ki but yeah that's how you out of tattoo
to<00:04:14.960> someone's<00:04:15.290> body
