show it to all of them but more than

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:37.360 
show it to all of them but more than
likely<00:05:35.960> at<00:05:36.289> least<00:05:36.440> one<00:05:36.680> will<00:05:36.860> get<00:05:36.979> recorded

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:37.370

soon I'm going to definitely put some
kind<00:05:39.530> of<00:05:39.620> montage<00:05:39.950> on<00:05:40.130> that<00:05:40.340> there<00:05:40.610> you<00:05:41.060> can

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:41.180 
kind of montage on that there you can

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:42.790 
kind of montage on that there you can
see<00:05:41.210> me<00:05:41.450> in<00:05:41.510> action<00:05:41.690> more<00:05:42.110> than<00:05:42.289> likely<00:05:42.470> it'll

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:42.800 
see me in action more than likely it'll

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:45.640 
see me in action more than likely it'll
be<00:05:42.919> me<00:05:43.070> like<00:05:43.310> spinning<00:05:44.090> over<00:05:44.240> like<00:05:44.539> I've<00:05:45.500> been

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:45.650 
be me like spinning over like I've been

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:48.830 
trying to run for like two weeks now and

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:51.190 
trying to run for like two weeks now and
it<00:05:49.220> does<00:05:49.280> not<00:05:49.520> make<00:05:49.760> ever<00:05:49.940> just<00:05:50.210> running<00:05:50.570> does

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:51.200 
it does not make ever just running does

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:52.390 
it does not make ever just running does
not<00:05:51.380> make<00:05:51.560> up<00:05:51.680> for<00:05:51.830> all<00:05:51.860> this<00:05:52.070> stuff<00:05:52.190> that<00:05:52.340> you

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:52.400 
not make up for all this stuff that you

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:54.159 
not make up for all this stuff that you
have<00:05:52.490> to<00:05:52.580> do<00:05:52.729> on<00:05:52.970> the<00:05:53.090> field<00:05:53.300> we're<00:05:53.930> on<00:05:54.050> the

00:05:54.159 --> 00:05:54.169 
have to do on the field we're on the

00:05:54.169 --> 00:05:55.900 
have to do on the field we're on the
pitch<00:05:54.410> as<00:05:54.740> some<00:05:54.950> of<00:05:55.039> you<00:05:55.099> like<00:05:55.250> to<00:05:55.340> call<00:05:55.490> it<00:05:55.550> so

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:55.910 
pitch as some of you like to call it so

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:58.000 
pitch as some of you like to call it so
it's<00:05:56.539> going<00:05:56.630> to<00:05:56.690> be<00:05:56.810> interesting<00:05:57.020> more<00:05:57.860> than

00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:58.010 
it's going to be interesting more than

00:05:58.010 --> 00:05:59.920 
it's going to be interesting more than
likely<00:05:58.190> playing<00:05:58.610> then<00:05:58.789> field<00:05:59.030> starting<00:05:59.810> out

00:05:59.920 --> 00:05:59.930 
likely playing then field starting out

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:01.270 
likely playing then field starting out
playing<00:06:00.169> midfield<00:06:00.349> which<00:06:00.770> is<00:06:00.889> a<00:06:00.919> lot<00:06:01.250> of

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:01.280 
playing midfield which is a lot of

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:03.670 
playing midfield which is a lot of
running<00:06:01.700> so<00:06:02.240> I'm<00:06:02.599> kind<00:06:02.840> of<00:06:02.870> excited<00:06:03.169> about<00:06:03.380> it

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:03.680 
running so I'm kind of excited about it
