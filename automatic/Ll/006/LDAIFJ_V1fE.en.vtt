00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
in one give you another update on my

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:14.690 
in one give you another update on my
Hypermotard<00:00:13.200> as<00:00:14.070> you<00:00:14.250> remember<00:00:14.490> from<00:00:14.639> last

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
Hypermotard as you remember from last

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.830 
Hypermotard as you remember from last
time<00:00:15.150> I<00:00:16.640> installed<00:00:17.640> a<00:00:17.820> carbon<00:00:18.150> fiber<00:00:18.359> piece<00:00:18.630> on

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
time I installed a carbon fiber piece on

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.279 
time I installed a carbon fiber piece on
the<00:00:18.930> tail<00:00:19.109> section<00:00:20.600> came<00:00:21.600> out<00:00:21.779> really<00:00:22.080> great

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
the tail section came out really great

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.150 
the tail section came out really great
so<00:00:22.619> I<00:00:22.680> gave<00:00:23.070> a<00:00:23.820> call<00:00:24.720> to<00:00:24.779> mvi<00:00:25.320> performance<00:00:26.010> this

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
so I gave a call to mvi performance this

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.220 
so I gave a call to mvi performance this
time<00:00:26.220> they<00:00:27.029> also<00:00:27.060> have<00:00:27.300> an<00:00:27.510> eBay<00:00:27.779> store<00:00:27.810> and

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
time they also have an eBay store and

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.259 
time they also have an eBay store and
they<00:00:28.349> sell<00:00:28.529> carbon<00:00:28.949> fiber<00:00:29.160> stock<00:00:29.460> and<00:00:30.179> they

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
they sell carbon fiber stock and they

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.569 
they sell carbon fiber stock and they
sent<00:00:30.539> over<00:00:30.660> the<00:00:31.080> whole<00:00:31.230> front<00:00:31.500> section<00:00:31.949> of<00:00:32.160> the

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
sent over the whole front section of the

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.450 
sent over the whole front section of the
Hypermotard<00:00:33.030> in<00:00:33.780> carbon<00:00:34.140> fiber<00:00:34.410> as<00:00:35.130> you<00:00:35.309> can

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
Hypermotard in carbon fiber as you can

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.520 
Hypermotard in carbon fiber as you can
see<00:00:35.700> the<00:00:36.390> weave<00:00:36.600> is<00:00:36.899> really<00:00:37.200> professional

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
see the weave is really professional

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.590 
see the weave is really professional
there<00:00:38.340> aren't<00:00:38.969> really<00:00:39.149> a<00:00:39.270> lot<00:00:39.360> of

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
there aren't really a lot of

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.560 
there aren't really a lot of
imperfections<00:00:40.040> but<00:00:41.040> the<00:00:41.280> true<00:00:41.460> test<00:00:41.489> is<00:00:42.000> when

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
imperfections but the true test is when

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.240 
imperfections but the true test is when
we<00:00:42.660> install<00:00:42.989> it<00:00:43.140> we'll<00:00:43.980> see<00:00:44.219> if<00:00:44.399> it<00:00:44.550> fits

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:46.250 
we install it we'll see if it fits

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:48.619 
we install it we'll see if it fits
changing<00:00:47.250> the<00:00:47.520> front<00:00:47.789> end<00:00:48.000> is<00:00:48.120> pretty<00:00:48.300> simple

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
changing the front end is pretty simple

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.110 
changing the front end is pretty simple
as<00:00:49.320> you<00:00:49.559> see<00:00:49.890> from<00:00:50.100> the<00:00:50.309> carbon<00:00:50.610> fiber<00:00:50.850> piece

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
as you see from the carbon fiber piece

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.400 
as you see from the carbon fiber piece
there's<00:00:51.480> one<00:00:51.840> two<00:00:52.320> three<00:00:52.800> four<00:00:53.670> five<00:00:54.570> six

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
there's one two three four five six

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.410 
there's one two three four five six
seven<00:00:55.710> places<00:00:56.070> so<00:00:56.879> that<00:00:57.030> means<00:00:57.180> that<00:00:57.239> there

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
seven places so that means that there

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.139 
seven places so that means that there
are<00:00:57.480> seven<00:00:57.780> bolts<00:00:58.109> that<00:00:58.260> we<00:00:58.379> have<00:00:58.559> to<00:00:59.149> unscrew

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
are seven bolts that we have to unscrew

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.080 
are seven bolts that we have to unscrew
and<00:01:00.329> screw<00:01:00.390> back<00:01:00.719> in<00:01:01.430> so<00:01:02.430> I'm<00:01:02.699> going<00:01:02.910> to<00:01:02.969> do

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
and screw back in so I'm going to do

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.299 
and screw back in so I'm going to do
that<00:01:03.239> and<00:01:03.600> you<00:01:04.470> can<00:01:04.619> see<00:01:04.739> how<00:01:04.860> it<00:01:04.979> looks<00:01:05.010> when

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
that and you can see how it looks when

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.380 
that and you can see how it looks when
I'm<00:01:05.430> done<00:01:07.250> first<00:01:08.250> thing<00:01:08.369> you<00:01:08.700> want<00:01:08.909> to<00:01:08.939> do<00:01:09.150> is

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:33.770 
here we have to transfer the brackets

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:36.649 
here we have to transfer the brackets
metal<00:01:34.770> brackets<00:01:35.189> from<00:01:35.310> here<00:01:35.670> to<00:01:36.030> here<00:01:36.390> and

also the bottom plastic piece from here

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.410 
also the bottom plastic piece from here
to<00:01:39.930> here<00:01:40.140> so<00:01:40.740> we'll<00:01:40.890> do<00:01:41.009> that<00:01:41.189> now<00:01:41.430> before<00:01:42.060> we

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
to here so we'll do that now before we

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.260 
to here so we'll do that now before we
can<00:01:42.600> install<00:01:42.630> the<00:01:43.140> new<00:01:43.170> cotton<00:01:43.439> fibers<00:01:44.270> while

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
can install the new cotton fibers while

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.660 
can install the new cotton fibers while
transferring<00:01:45.840> the<00:01:46.200> bottom<00:01:46.890> plastic<00:01:47.250> piece

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
transferring the bottom plastic piece

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.710 
transferring the bottom plastic piece
and<00:01:48.450> notice<00:01:48.810> that<00:01:49.520> the<00:01:50.520> carbon<00:01:50.790> fiber<00:01:51.119> one<00:01:51.360> has

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
and notice that the carbon fiber one has

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.209 
and notice that the carbon fiber one has
two<00:01:52.110> less<00:01:53.299> brackets<00:01:54.299> than<00:01:54.720> the<00:01:54.869> OEM<00:01:55.200> one<00:01:55.590> see

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
two less brackets than the OEM one see

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:00.649 
two less brackets than the OEM one see
there's<00:01:56.490> one<00:01:56.850> two<00:01:57.479> three<00:01:57.509> four<00:01:58.170> here<00:01:59.070> but<00:02:00.000> it's

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
there's one two three four here but it's

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:05.240 
there's one two three four here but it's
only<00:02:00.869> one<00:02:01.380> two<00:02:01.890> here<00:02:02.600> but<00:02:03.600> since<00:02:04.590> we<00:02:04.829> have<00:02:05.040> this

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
only one two here but since we have this

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.100 
only one two here but since we have this
one<00:02:05.490> here<00:02:05.729> I<00:02:05.759> think<00:02:06.060> it<00:02:06.180> should<00:02:06.360> be<00:02:06.509> sufficient

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
one here I think it should be sufficient

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.510 
one here I think it should be sufficient
enough<00:02:07.140> to<00:02:07.530> hold<00:02:07.770> the

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
enough to hold the

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:13.100 
enough to hold the
dick<00:02:08.640> piece<00:02:08.850> up<00:02:10.520> so<00:02:11.520> unfortunately<00:02:12.240> the

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
dick piece up so unfortunately the

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.920 
dick piece up so unfortunately the
plastic<00:02:13.680> doesn't<00:02:14.520> fit<00:02:14.970> on<00:02:15.180> the<00:02:15.390> new<00:02:15.540> carbon

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
plastic doesn't fit on the new carbon

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:20.920 
plastic doesn't fit on the new carbon
fiber<00:02:16.200> piece<00:02:18.470> MDI<00:02:19.470> has<00:02:19.830> some<00:02:20.100> answering<00:02:20.520> to<00:02:20.640> do

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
fiber piece MDI has some answering to do

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:24.320 
fiber piece MDI has some answering to do
I<00:02:21.930> was<00:02:22.680> thinking<00:02:22.710> of<00:02:23.100> stretching<00:02:23.520> it<00:02:23.610> out<00:02:23.730> but

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
I was thinking of stretching it out but

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:28.580 
I was thinking of stretching it out but
this<00:02:24.840> looks<00:02:25.050> like<00:02:25.230> a<00:02:25.290> full<00:02:25.800> inch<00:02:27.320> smaller<00:02:28.320> than

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
this looks like a full inch smaller than

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:33.320 
this looks like a full inch smaller than
the<00:02:28.650> plastic<00:02:29.100> piece<00:02:30.620> so<00:02:31.620> MDI<00:02:32.130> has<00:02:32.460> some

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
the plastic piece so MDI has some

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.410 
the plastic piece so MDI has some
