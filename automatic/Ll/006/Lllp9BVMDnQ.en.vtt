00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:05.830 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:35.620 

okay<00:01:32.800> here<00:01:33.800> is<00:01:34.190> the<00:01:34.700> instruction<00:01:34.940> that<00:01:35.300> it

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630 
okay here is the instruction that it

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:47.580 
okay here is the instruction that it
comes<00:01:36.140> with<00:01:37.450> okay

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:47.590 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:02:07.840 

nothing<00:01:48.590> and<00:01:49.550> here<00:01:49.970> is<00:01:50.270> a<00:01:50.300> 3m<00:01:53.890> mount

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:07.850 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:12.220 

this<00:02:08.850> is<00:02:09.060> the<00:02:09.240> holder<00:02:09.630> it's<00:02:10.170> spring-loaded<00:02:10.619> oh

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
this is the holder it's spring-loaded oh

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:15.980 
this is the holder it's spring-loaded oh
you<00:02:13.230> can<00:02:13.470> see<00:02:13.620> the<00:02:13.740> spring<00:02:14.040> inside<00:02:14.690> one<00:02:15.690> hand

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
you can see the spring inside one hand

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:17.060 
you can see the spring inside one hand
operation

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:17.070 
operation

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:20.230 
operation
I<00:02:17.100> guess<00:02:18.000> it's<00:02:18.180> doable<00:02:18.450> but<00:02:18.780> it's<00:02:18.960> really

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:20.240 
I guess it's doable but it's really

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.430 
I guess it's doable but it's really
preferably<00:02:21.240> to<00:02:21.420> hand<00:02:21.660> it<00:02:21.780> will<00:02:22.050> be<00:02:22.200> a<00:02:22.230> lot

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
preferably to hand it will be a lot

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.800 
preferably to hand it will be a lot
better<00:02:22.820> and<00:02:23.820> you<00:02:23.970> can<00:02:24.150> do<00:02:24.270> it<00:02:24.390> with<00:02:24.510> one<00:02:24.780> hand

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
better and you can do it with one hand

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.250 
better and you can do it with one hand
like<00:02:25.170> so<00:02:25.290> but<00:02:26.360> two<00:02:27.360> hand<00:02:27.630> will<00:02:27.750> be<00:02:27.870> better<00:02:28.050> the

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
like so but two hand will be better the

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.410 
like so but two hand will be better the
springs<00:02:28.860> are<00:02:29.040> really<00:02:29.340> strong<00:02:29.610> actually<00:02:30.380> and

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
springs are really strong actually and

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:40.370 
springs are really strong actually and
here<00:02:33.420> is<00:02:33.690> a<00:02:34.430> little<00:02:35.430> knob<00:02:36.650> suction<00:02:38.090> and<00:02:39.380> this

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
here is a little knob suction and this

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:45.800 
here is a little knob suction and this
pops<00:02:40.680> open<00:02:42.170> and<00:02:43.640> to<00:02:44.640> assemble<00:02:45.030> this<00:02:45.360> then

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
pops open and to assemble this then

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.760 
pops open and to assemble this then
Shuksan<00:02:46.290> says<00:02:46.890> to<00:02:47.880> remove<00:02:48.390> this<00:02:48.660> so<00:02:49.200> turn<00:02:49.650> it

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:49.770 
Shuksan says to remove this so turn it

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:53.260 
Shuksan says to remove this so turn it

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:53.270 
counterclockwise this thing comes apart

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:58.190 
counterclockwise this thing comes apart
now<00:02:54.950> take<00:02:55.950> this<00:02:56.160> little<00:02:56.520> piece<00:02:56.610> and<00:02:57.180> put<00:02:58.170> it

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
now take this little piece and put it

now take this little piece and put it
over<00:02:58.380> the<00:02:58.739> little<00:03:01.820> wall<00:03:02.820> then<00:03:03.690> you<00:03:03.720> can<00:03:04.340> mount

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:08.510 
over the little wall then you can mount
this<00:03:05.550> all<00:03:05.790> together<00:03:05.970> like<00:03:06.270> that<00:03:06.530> okay<00:03:07.560> once

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:08.520 
this all together like that okay once

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:11.920 
this all together like that okay once

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
in and the us thing can turn 360 degree

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:23.570 
in and the us thing can turn 360 degree
in<00:03:20.459> one<00:03:20.640> hand<00:03:20.910> you<00:03:21.600> can<00:03:21.780> go<00:03:21.930> up<00:03:22.769> and<00:03:23.010> down<00:03:23.100> like
