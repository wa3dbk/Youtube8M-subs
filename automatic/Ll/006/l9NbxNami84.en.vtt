you know i think the first last few
rounds<00:01:12.540> were<00:01:12.780> a<00:01:12.810> bit<00:01:12.990> tough<00:01:13.200> and<00:01:13.430> we're

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
rounds were a bit tough and we're

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.310 
rounds were a bit tough and we're
searching<00:01:14.820> a<00:01:14.880> little<00:01:15.119> bit<00:01:15.270> but<00:01:15.479> you<00:01:15.930> know<00:01:16.020> it's

know<00:01:19.170> knowing<00:01:19.380> that<00:01:19.680> the<00:01:20.670> start<00:01:20.909> was<00:01:21.090> was<00:01:21.450> the

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
know knowing that the start was was the

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.609 
know knowing that the start was was the
the<00:01:22.350> main<00:01:23.689> deciding<00:01:24.689> factor<00:01:25.080> just<00:01:25.229> just<00:01:25.470> with

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
the main deciding factor just just with

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.380 
the main deciding factor just just with
getting<00:01:25.770> shuffled<00:01:26.040> back<00:01:26.310> there<00:01:26.580> so<00:01:26.790> we<00:01:27.240> gotta

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
getting shuffled back there so we gotta

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:28.789 
getting shuffled back there so we gotta
work<00:01:27.540> kind<00:01:27.750> of<00:01:27.810> starts<00:01:28.110> we'll<00:01:28.259> keep<00:01:28.439> up<00:01:28.590> on

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
work kind of starts we'll keep up on
