00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:06.250
 in this video we will learn to do 

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:07.990
 the brown rice but we are going to do it 

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:10.389
 in a different way because we're going to 

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:12.490
 let soak to be digested 

00:00:10.389 --> 00:00:13.959
 better so if you want to find out how 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:15.849
 prepare a brown rice that is 

00:00:13.959 --> 00:00:25.949
 do well do not miss the next 

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:25.949
 video we do not have much data for you 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:30.180
 but 

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:34.730
 dancing 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:34.730
 maybe this one is for you 

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:43.460
 good to prepare the rice 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:44.780
 let's do a previous step then it 's 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:45.890
 everything has to do with a little 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:47.750
 anticipation 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:49.220
 we are going to have lunch tomorrow 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:52.250
 brown rice then today in the 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:55.520
 night we will leave steeping 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:58.820
 the fund we had written an article 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:01.460
 a while ago about the difference between 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:03.350
 white rice and brown rice and if 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.970
 well the brown rice has more 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:08.300
 nutrients because a more whole grain 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:10.340
 It also has a greater content 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:13.520
 of phytic acid that a component in 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:15.080
 certain grains and in legumes that makes 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.180
 that when we eat the 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:19.280
 food we can not absorb some 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:23.390
 -30 minerals and streets within 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:25.550
 this great then if we want good and 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:28.460
 the other thing that has been critical is that it makes 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:31.009
 that the building is more difficult then 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:33.100
 the white rice on one side of greater 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:37.399
 lack 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:39.560
 of easier digestion but rice 

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:41.750
 integral has more nutrients then 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.100
 to be able to eat brown rice and that 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:46.130
 we fall good and get all 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:48.720
 nutrients we are going to let soak for 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:51.450
 eliminate phytic acid 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.980
 all this the most amount of training 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.400
 that I think I've found about 

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:59.520
 soak and remove the phytic acid in a 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:05.910
 book that is called no version traditions 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:08.490
 which is in the article that is in the 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:10.140
 comments of this from this video can 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:11.850
 find them the article of what we're going 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:15.270
 to write they were going to find the link 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:17.580
 the page of this foundation that 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:19.140
 base a little 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.930
 in what is transmitted through this 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.700
 book and they say to eliminate the 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:26.130
 phytic acid you have to keep digging 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:28.740
 the grains the cereals the legumes in 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:31.650
 a half a bit towards that can they 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:33.770
 use a lemon juice or vinegar 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.770
 Apple 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:39.290
 but of the liquid east as well as 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.660
 You can find the link to make them 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:46.570
 of the electric floor in an article that 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:49.250
 loves to post on the blog or in yogurt 

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:51.600
 all that makes me created a little 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:54.110
 acid to eliminate the acid fit 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:57.260
 well going to the water then we're going 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:57.260
 to do 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.310
 one 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:07.030
 an integral past 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:15.790
 and let them soak in two cups of 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:15.790
 Water 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:21.960
 we are using purified water 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:25.070
 even if it's for cooking also try 

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:25.070
 water with fruits 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:32.030
 of water and two tablespoons of vinegar 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:34.370
 apple but if they do not have vinegar 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:35.710
 apple I know they can use juice 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:39.460
 lemon 

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:41.740
 yogurt or buttermilk 

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:44.580
 and this can tuna the human being 

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:50.920
 like a minimum of seven hours then 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:53.050
 the tapas and capture him tomorrow and tomorrow 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:55.950
 to show how the preparation continues 

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:55.950
 of the referee 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:02.890
 It's been about 12 hours since 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:03.570
 we let the rice soak for 7 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:10.210
 hours 

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:12.730
 12 we now have rice and now 

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:16.980
 is wet and what we are going to do is 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:16.980
 let's vote this water 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:25.970
 and we are going to put some rice not 

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:25.970
 do just a little 

00:04:38.279 --> 00:04:46.059
 it is assumed that this makes them comes the 

00:04:44.199 --> 00:04:48.169
 phytic acid of what we were 

00:04:46.059 --> 00:04:50.270
 talking before 

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:51.979
 after the physical io between one of the things 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:53.870
 that prevents absorption is from the iron 

00:04:51.979 --> 00:04:57.020
 then maybe people with anemia 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:58.939
 they should have as a young man eat many 

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:01.540
 grains that are not properly 

00:04:58.939 --> 00:05:05.280
 prepared with soaking 

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:08.830
 to make sure and now we're going to add 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:11.830
 again let 's water we 're going to add 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:14.830
 now 2 and a half 

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:17.400
 there are those who say that it is cooked with two 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:17.400
 cups of water 

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:35.620
 now 

00:05:33.729 --> 00:05:37.350
 what they are going to do is make this 

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:39.690
 boil 

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:42.680
 and once you'll already down call 

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:45.229
 they put the total is 45 minutes 

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:47.410
 so we're going to show you later the 

00:05:45.229 --> 00:05:47.410
 results 

00:05:47.729 --> 00:05:55.180
 now that it started to boil 

00:05:50.470 --> 00:06:00.690
 lower the flame cover it and put a 

00:05:55.180 --> 00:06:00.690
 toaster and here I wait in 45 minutes 

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:08.720
 the 45 minutes passed 

00:06:08.949 --> 00:06:12.699
 and we stayed like that 

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:20.550
 I like the more we 

00:06:20.639 --> 00:06:28.229
 I did not get this rice because I 

00:06:26.159 --> 00:06:31.710
 I want to use it tomorrow for breakfast 

00:06:28.229 --> 00:06:36.590
 I'm going to mix it with cinnamon with 

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:38.849
 almonds and with honey for breakfast and 

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:42.449
 but if you want to make it salty 

00:06:38.849 --> 00:06:44.039
 they may be interested in vegetables that they want 

00:06:42.449 --> 00:06:47.749
 If they want later, they can use it to 

00:06:44.039 --> 00:06:47.749
 do some subtle 

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:54.050
 more in the background this recipe that we 

00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:58.570
 we did is so that the brown rice is 

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:58.570
 her in a better way and 

00:07:03.009 --> 00:07:07.609

00:07:16.329 --> 00:07:20.229
 of very rich meals 

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:28.160
 that was it, so we'll see each other for the 

00:07:23.879 --> 00:07:31.969
 staff and have a nice day chao 

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:37.089
