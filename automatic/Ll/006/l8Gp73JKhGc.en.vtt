00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.859
 my name is your from a bartender dietician 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:08.029
 registered and certified specialist in 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:08.029
 sports diet 

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:14.650
 I became interested in nutrition in my last 

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:16.630
 year of the university had a degree in 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:18.220
 biology and I really did not know what to do 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:20.410
 with it I was thinking about the 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:22.360
 possibility of entering medicine but 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:24.400
 I always had a lot of interest in cooking 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:27.100
 I have always been interested in health 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:29.590
 and nutrition since I can remember 

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:31.359
 I've always had a garden and someone 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:33.129
 he started talking about nutritionists and 

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:35.769
 Dietitians in one of my classes 

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:38.260
 biology then I thought 

00:00:35.769 --> 00:00:40.809
 wow can I get a degree in that 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:43.390
 something that I did not even know and from 

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:45.070
 then I did not look back I think 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:48.549
 that this is something that brings all my love 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:51.070
 for science nutrition and health and 

00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:52.540
 it has been a wonderful choice never 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:57.210
 I have spent a boring day in all my 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:57.210
 I have enjoyed every day 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:04.600
 in the USA there is a very 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:07.000
 specific to become a dietitian 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:09.490
 registered there is a bachelor's degree that 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.920
 must complete in certain courses and then 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:14.530
 a dietitian internship is made which 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:16.509
 usually lasts a year after it is taken 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:18.820
 an examination and once the 

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:21.330
 exam you can use the credential of 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:21.330
 registered dietitian 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:29.039
 probably the most common question that 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.320
 listened to which is no big surprise is 

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:33.450
 what is the fastest way to lose 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.819
 weight and to most people to 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.560
 who has attended to those who seek me 

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:39.210
 who want to lose weight obviously 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.520
 we cover all the related topics 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.679
 with nutrition when you sit down 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.630
 conversation with a dietitian may have 

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:47.130
 other things involved but most 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.319
 of the people with whom I deal 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.969
 they want to control their weight and not even 

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:53.219
 They want to know how to do it with 

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:55.740
 caution but really want it 

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:57.539
 know how to do it fast so there's 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.360
 need to provide them a lot 

00:01:57.539 --> 00:02:02.849
 education how much should weigh how much 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:05.579
 time is going to take you we must see each 

00:02:02.849 --> 00:02:07.860
 person individually we have to 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:09.840
 know how active is how many changes 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:13.250
 is willing to do in your diet before 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.250
 that we can do this evaluation 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.349
 I've been working with oaks for 

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:22.239
 about ten years and it really has been very 

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:24.430
 fun because my role here has been 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:26.799
 expanded and has evolved during this 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:29.170
 time at the beginning it was very shallow 

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:31.299
 but I've slowly been educating myself more 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:33.340
 about nutrition to the point 

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:35.349
 I'm writing this what I'm doing 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:39.030
 making videos has really been a 

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:39.030
 great experience for me 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.860
 if I mention to the people that I am 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.870
 working for robots and they are not 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:48.180
 familiar with the company what 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:50.099
 they usually say is oh that's the company 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:52.019
 who sells supplements so I have the 

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:53.969
 opportunity to teach them a little and 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:55.890
 I say what it is about much more than 

00:02:53.969 --> 00:02:58.079
 supplements and shakes there are other 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:59.640
 things involved is not only the 

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:01.769
 product but we really are 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:03.209
 selling a program to people not 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:05.400
 we only teach them how to use the product 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:07.849
 but also to lead a life more 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.849
 fury 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:13.700
 I would say there are two things that 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:16.040
 I mainly enjoy working with 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:17.840
 robots I think the first one is that the 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:20.090
 company is really dedicated to 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:22.070
 provide a lot of nutrition education and 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:24.010
 I think that is very important because 

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:27.050
 We do more than sell the product 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:28.970
 we sell a healthy and active lifestyle 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:32.270
 and we teach people to eat well 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:34.730
 and lead a healthier life I think the 

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:36.470
 another good thing for me personally has 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:38.540
 been able to be more 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:40.580
 creative and have other means 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:43.900
 creative that I did not have before to help 

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:43.900
 to educate people 

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:52.890
 for me a healthy and active lifestyle 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:54.880
 it's something that I live every day is part of me 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:56.980
 so I do not have to think and 

00:03:54.880 --> 00:04:00.130
 reflect every day what I 'm going to eat 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:01.870
 or when I'm going to exercise I think it's 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:03.820
 has become a natural part of me 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:06.550
 choose the correct food the greatest 

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:08.920
 part of the time try to be active 

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:11.069
 during the day in addition to the exercise 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:13.560
 formal I try to do 

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:15.180
 so for me a healthy lifestyle and 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:18.180
 active is something that has become 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:21.810
 automatic I enjoy it because when 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:24.109
 as well and I am active I feel what 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:24.109
 best 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:31.830
 I think what I'm most proud of 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:33.360
 is from the fact of being able to reach 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:35.640
 people from all over the world 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:37.770
 I think it's an incredible opportunity 

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:41.750
 bring good nutritional information 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:41.750
 to all the people in the world
