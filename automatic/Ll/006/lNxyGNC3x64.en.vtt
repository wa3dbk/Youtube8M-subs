because<00:02:40.250> it's<00:02:41.230> it's<00:02:42.230> a<00:02:42.410> little<00:02:42.790> it's<00:02:43.790> like<00:02:43.910> a

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:43.940 
because it's it's a little it's like a

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:46.150 
because it's it's a little it's like a
love<00:02:44.239> letter<00:02:44.450> to<00:02:44.630> the<00:02:45.200> Halo<00:02:45.470> universe<00:02:45.500> where
