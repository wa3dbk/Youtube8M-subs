the type of hardware they have now one

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:24.620 
the type of hardware they have now one
of<00:00:23.460> the<00:00:23.580> first<00:00:23.789> things<00:00:23.910> that<00:00:24.119> I'd<00:00:24.300> recommend

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
of the first things that I'd recommend

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.480 
of the first things that I'd recommend
you<00:00:24.900> doing<00:00:25.260> and<00:00:25.410> probably<00:00:25.650> the<00:00:25.800> easiest<00:00:26.220> is

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
you doing and probably the easiest is

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.050 
you doing and probably the easiest is
just<00:00:27.119> simply<00:00:27.449> changing<00:00:28.050> your<00:00:28.199> video<00:00:28.439> settings

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:29.060 
just simply changing your video settings

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:32.959 
just simply changing your video settings
so<00:00:30.060> you<00:00:30.090> just<00:00:30.300> hit<00:00:30.420> escape<00:00:30.630> good<00:00:31.560> options<00:00:32.130> then

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
so you just hit escape good options then

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.200 
so you just hit escape good options then
video<00:00:33.300> and<00:00:34.070> set<00:00:35.070> your<00:00:35.250> graphics<00:00:35.730> quality<00:00:35.880> to

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
video and set your graphics quality to

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.760 
video and set your graphics quality to
custom<00:00:36.660> so<00:00:36.840> you<00:00:36.899> can<00:00:37.079> change<00:00:37.320> all<00:00:37.559> the

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
custom so you can change all the

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.810 
custom so you can change all the
settings<00:00:37.800> below<00:00:38.340> it's<00:00:39.210> either<00:00:39.390> off<00:00:39.690> or<00:00:39.719> low

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:40.820

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
except for effects quality and mesh

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.220 
except for effects quality and mesh
quality<00:00:44.430> I<00:00:44.610> set<00:00:45.210> both<00:00:45.420> of<00:00:45.570> those<00:00:45.660> two<00:00:45.840> ultra

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
quality I set both of those two ultra

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.560 
quality I set both of those two ultra
you<00:00:47.219> can<00:00:47.370> also<00:00:47.520> try<00:00:47.940> changing<00:00:48.270> your

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.080 
borderless or windowed mode you can try
turning<00:00:54.570> vertical<00:00:55.260> sync<00:00:55.500> on<00:00:55.879> I've<00:00:56.879> heard

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
turning vertical sync on I've heard

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.319 
turning vertical sync on I've heard
someone<00:00:57.719> had<00:00:57.870> success<00:00:58.410> with<00:00:58.440> that<00:00:58.620> I<00:00:59.329> didn't

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
someone had success with that I didn't

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.039 
someone had success with that I didn't
like<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:01.039> motion<00:01:02.039> blur<00:01:02.250> in<00:01:02.460> bf3<00:01:02.879> so<00:01:03.510> I<00:01:03.809> went

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
like the motion blur in bf3 so I went

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:05.929 
like the motion blur in bf3 so I went
ahead<00:01:04.140> and<00:01:04.350> turned<00:01:04.559> it<00:01:04.799> down<00:01:05.010> a<00:01:05.070> zero<00:01:05.489> percent

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
ahead and turned it down a zero percent

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.020 
ahead and turned it down a zero percent
and<00:01:06.119> VF<00:01:06.299> four<00:01:06.510> as<00:01:06.659> well<00:01:07.100> now<00:01:08.100> with<00:01:08.340> resolution

scale<00:01:09.950> the<00:01:10.950> default<00:01:11.369> is<00:01:11.520> a<00:01:11.549> hundred<00:01:12.030> and<00:01:13.580> to

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
scale the default is a hundred and to

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.550 
scale the default is a hundred and to
put<00:01:14.760> it<00:01:14.790> in<00:01:14.970> layman's<00:01:15.150> terms<00:01:15.420> two<00:01:16.259> hundred

put it in layman's terms two hundred

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.539 
put it in layman's terms two hundred
percent<00:01:16.920> would<00:01:17.460> be<00:01:17.750> twice<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:19.250> video<00:01:20.250> quality

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
percent would be twice the video quality

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.940 
percent would be twice the video quality
and<00:01:20.970> twenty<00:01:21.720> five<00:01:21.930> percent<00:01:21.960> would<00:01:22.470> be<00:01:22.650> one

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
and twenty five percent would be one

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.490 
and twenty five percent would be one
quarter<00:01:23.369> of<00:01:23.400> the<00:01:23.460> video<00:01:23.729> quality<00:01:24.350> compared<00:01:25.350> to

quarter of the video quality compared to

quarter of the video quality compared to
the<00:01:25.619> default<00:01:25.979> of<00:01:26.189> 100<00:01:26.700> I<00:01:27.560> just<00:01:28.560> leave<00:01:28.740> mine<00:01:28.950> at

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
the default of 100 I just leave mine at

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.319 
the default of 100 I just leave mine at
100<00:01:29.549> and<00:01:29.790> I<00:01:29.939> my<00:01:30.930> performance<00:01:31.590> is<00:01:31.710> fine<00:01:32.610> I<00:01:32.939> don't

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
100 and I my performance is fine I don't

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.810 
100 and I my performance is fine I don't
really<00:01:33.600> have<00:01:33.750> that<00:01:33.780> many<00:01:34.500> problems<00:01:34.860> with<00:01:35.280> like

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
really have that many problems with like

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.170 
really have that many problems with like
FPS<00:01:36.060> drops<00:01:36.780> and<00:01:36.990> things<00:01:37.170> like<00:01:37.290> that<00:01:38.000> so<00:01:39.000> once

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
FPS drops and things like that so once

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.760 
FPS drops and things like that so once
you're<00:01:39.270> done<00:01:39.360> with<00:01:39.540> that<00:01:39.570> just<00:01:40.320> hit<00:01:40.500> apply

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
you're done with that just hit apply

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.139 
you're done with that just hit apply
video<00:01:41.130> settings<00:01:41.579> and<00:01:41.850> hit<00:01:42.210> yes<00:01:43.729> the<00:01:44.729> second

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
video settings and hit yes the second

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:46.310 
video settings and hit yes the second
thing<00:01:45.240> that<00:01:45.299> I<00:01:45.450> would<00:01:45.570> recommend<00:01:45.960> is

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
thing that I would recommend is

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.109 
thing that I would recommend is
downloading<00:01:46.890> the<00:01:47.040> latest<00:01:47.189> drivers<00:01:47.820> for<00:01:48.090> your

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
downloading the latest drivers for your

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.780 
downloading the latest drivers for your
video<00:01:48.509> card<00:01:48.869> or<00:01:49.049> GPU<00:01:49.409> you<00:01:50.340> can<00:01:50.460> do<00:01:50.579> that<00:01:50.729> by

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
video card or GPU you can do that by

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.020 
video card or GPU you can do that by
going<00:01:51.210> to<00:01:51.509> nvidia<00:01:52.020> com<00:01:52.530> or<00:01:52.770> AMD<00:01:53.100> calm<00:01:53.759> and

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
going to nvidia com or AMD calm and

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
far as in video cards are concerned I've

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:04.639

well<00:03:28.160> the<00:03:29.160> last<00:03:29.400> thing<00:03:29.640> to<00:03:29.850> my<00:03:30.060> knowledge<00:03:30.360> that

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
well the last thing to my knowledge that

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:32.900 
well the last thing to my knowledge that
you<00:03:30.810> can<00:03:30.959> try<00:03:31.170> and<00:03:31.440> probably<00:03:31.860> the<00:03:32.519> one<00:03:32.700> that<00:03:32.880> I

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:32.910 
you can try and probably the one that I

you can try and probably the one that I
would<00:03:33.150> recommend<00:03:33.510> the<00:03:33.780> least<00:03:34.019> is<00:03:34.820> installing

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:35.820 
would recommend the least is installing

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:40.150 
would recommend the least is installing
