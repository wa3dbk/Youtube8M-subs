00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:12.010 
so tie that in a little bow at the back
and<00:02:09.399> then<00:02:10.399> I<00:02:10.580> would<00:02:10.670> stitch<00:02:11.209> along<00:02:11.569> there<00:02:11.810> so

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.020 
and then I would stitch along there so

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:13.570 
and then I would stitch along there so
I'm<00:02:12.080> just<00:02:12.140> stitching<00:02:12.620> in<00:02:12.890> one<00:02:13.069> place<00:02:13.340> which

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
I'm just stitching in one place which

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.589 
I'm just stitching in one place which
could<00:02:13.760> be<00:02:13.880> by<00:02:14.060> hand<00:02:14.390> or<00:02:14.990> by<00:02:15.050> machine

00:02:16.589 --> 00:02:16.599 
could be by hand or by machine

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:19.539 
could be by hand or by machine
that<00:02:17.599> is<00:02:17.750> totally<00:02:18.349> fantastic<00:02:18.590> imagine<00:02:19.400> that

00:02:19.539 --> 00:02:19.549 
that is totally fantastic imagine that

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:21.550 
that is totally fantastic imagine that
some<00:02:19.819> black<00:02:20.030> leggings<00:02:20.540> so<00:02:21.079> that<00:02:21.260> the<00:02:21.379> lace

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
some black leggings so that the lace

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.759 
some black leggings so that the lace
really<00:02:21.890> shows<00:02:22.250> up<00:02:22.540> so<00:02:23.540> today<00:02:23.599> I'm<00:02:24.379> going<00:02:24.680> to

00:02:24.759 --> 00:02:24.769 
really shows up so today I'm going to

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:27.009 
really shows up so today I'm going to
make<00:02:24.920> an<00:02:25.099> apron<00:02:25.519> out<00:02:25.730> of<00:02:26.120> to<00:02:26.450> slightly

00:02:27.009 --> 00:02:27.019 
make an apron out of to slightly

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:29.559 
make an apron out of to slightly
contrasting<00:02:28.010> aprons<00:02:28.579> so<00:02:29.090> that<00:02:29.239> they<00:02:29.329> look<00:02:29.480> a

00:02:29.559 --> 00:02:29.569 
contrasting aprons so that they look a

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:31.839 
contrasting aprons so that they look a
bit<00:02:29.599> edgy<00:02:29.900> now<00:02:30.650> remember<00:02:31.129> you<00:02:31.519> can<00:02:31.670> put

00:02:31.839 --> 00:02:31.849 
bit edgy now remember you can put

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:34.000 
bit edgy now remember you can put
totally<00:02:32.659> different<00:02:33.109> aprons<00:02:33.560> together<00:02:33.920> I

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
totally different aprons together I

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.309 
totally different aprons together I
think<00:02:34.220> it'd<00:02:34.519> look<00:02:34.670> quite<00:02:34.909> surreal<00:02:35.359> and<00:02:35.629> cold

00:02:36.309 --> 00:02:36.319 
think it'd look quite surreal and cold

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:39.130 
think it'd look quite surreal and cold
now<00:02:37.069> what<00:02:37.250> I'm<00:02:37.310> gonna<00:02:37.430> do<00:02:37.700> is<00:02:37.909> I'm<00:02:38.390> going<00:02:38.989> to

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:41.589 
now what I'm gonna do is I'm going to
just<00:02:39.709> line<00:02:40.670> them<00:02:40.819> up<00:02:40.970> so<00:02:41.299> that<00:02:41.329> they're

00:02:41.589 --> 00:02:41.599 
just line them up so that they're

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:44.069 
just line them up so that they're
definitely<00:02:41.930> overlapping<00:02:42.769> at<00:02:43.010> the<00:02:43.099> back<00:02:43.310> and

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:44.079 
definitely overlapping at the back and

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:49.629

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
is underneath back with some force when

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:40.220 
is underneath back with some force when
I<00:03:37.800> stop<00:03:38.160> take<00:03:38.580> it<00:03:38.760> off<00:03:38.879> and<00:03:39.239> then<00:03:39.810> let's<00:03:40.019> have<00:03:40.200> a

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
I stop take it off and then let's have a

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:42.380 
I stop take it off and then let's have a
look<00:03:40.500> right<00:03:41.250> so<00:03:41.310> you<00:03:41.640> can<00:03:41.879> see<00:03:42.090> where<00:03:42.269> I've

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:42.390 
look right so you can see where I've

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:44.089 
look right so you can see where I've
said<00:03:42.690> you<00:03:42.930> can<00:03:43.050> see<00:03:43.230> what's<00:03:43.410> going<00:03:43.470> on<00:03:43.800> that's

said you can see what's going on that's
the<00:03:44.370> back<00:03:44.550> so<00:03:45.060> essentially<00:03:45.599> we've<00:03:45.750> ended<00:03:46.050> up

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 
the back so essentially we've ended up

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:49.250 
the back so essentially we've ended up
with<00:03:46.349> a<00:03:46.440> wonderful<00:03:47.220> wraparound<00:03:48.120> skirt<00:03:48.660> now
