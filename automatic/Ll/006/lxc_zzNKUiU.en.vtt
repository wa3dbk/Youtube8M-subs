00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:21.850
 a friend as you see this is another way of 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:23.770
 configuration that we have here is worth 

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:25.599
 very similar to the previous one so 

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:27.670
 it is characterized that this side of 

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:30.010
 here and is taking the soil is not 

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:32.349
 totally stuck with this building with 

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:33.780
 a little game with agreement but 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:37.520
 It would also be a little bit 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:40.790
 close a bit us with 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:42.350
 in this case with pinocchio grass 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:43.710
 color estuaries to protect more of the 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:45.690
 wind 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:49.260
 in this configuration what is wanted 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.430
 that this pledge we put it from where we 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.199
 the wind comes to protect us from 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.160
 wind and even protect us from the re 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:58.989
 Encouraged by the help of all 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.989
 period up in the games 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:02.650
 is very similar to the previous one is not 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.570
 exactly the same but 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:07.020
 very well it would be like a configuration 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:10.200
 very similar 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.920
 as always remember that you have to close 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.920
 the hat 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:20.229
 to enter the water and like everything if I 

00:01:16.689 --> 00:01:21.850
 saw with a poncho the tall people 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:22.960
 to have problems always to the head 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:24.250
 and on the feet 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.689
 ok then you have to put on a 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:29.430
 little bit like that is a little bit of the pack 

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:29.430
 in to sleep 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:33.630
 these studies come in handy when 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:36.470
 when the dry weather I'm going to cook 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.270
 to encourage encouraged 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:40.380
 where when there are little things like that it's worth a lot 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:42.119
 humidity and others 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.440
 now we will see some that work a 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.330
 little better with the rain 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:47.750
 what this leads us to the 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:49.490
 mother 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.530
 there is no other configuration that is very 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:53.870
 similar to this one she would also be with 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:55.460
 the four points touching the ground to 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:58.370
 I'm not going to do that because the prima 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:01.240
 it would be the 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:01.240
 shaped like a 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:05.140
 I personally do not like it, I prefer 

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:07.390
 lift it up a little bit more because the other one is 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:10.119
 very very close it costs you to get 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:12.610
 even touch me I'm pretty wide 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:14.950
 put colors to the sides of the 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:16.540
 Poncho with shoulders and such and so 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.400
 compensated for we know that if we play 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.360
 wet by bodies we had no ando 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.920
 inside 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.230
 then I prefer to lift it in 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.060
 few that know that there is also another 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:28.360
 it's totally like that but with one it 's fine 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:31.120
 but with 8 very small at least 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.490
 for good let's move on to the other series 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:35.100
 d 

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:38.280
 configuration types as you see in 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:40.860
 these explained so far all carry 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:43.020
 a mother line that is placed in two 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:45.150
 trees one in front of the other and with 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:47.430
 Regarding that, we already put the 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:49.560
 poncho is the next let's suppose 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.820
 that we do not have that line is worth or yes 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.960
 we have it but we have used that 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:53.420
 rope for something else but this to 

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:56.230
 know the circumstance that we have 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:59.300
 then we will use 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:01.430
 directly the poncho on the floor 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:02.810
 we have shorter strings and not one 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:04.550
 mother line 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:08.130
 that's what I say no 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:10.170
 so nothing we're going to let's see 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:12.900
 good friends this would be the refuge 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:14.380
 for storms for when there are big 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.270
 rains 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:19.940
 the young storms and others go 

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:23.630
 this shelter protects you very well from what 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:25.710
 that the wind and the rain obviously the 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:28.360
 rain in large amount 

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:31.030
 inconveniences of this refuge there are 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:33.670
 as with all shelters now I will pass 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:35.980
 to say I'll explain a little bit like 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:39.069
 pick up shelter and take the four 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:41.799
 corners anchored to the ground 

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:43.629
 and then those two the two 

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:46.120
 central we tell them little raised 

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:47.890
 is more to enter and exit doing 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:49.300
 this as a door 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:51.080
 obviously this would have to be lowered but 

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:54.020
 let's go to sleep 

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:55.940
 find the water and then that one 

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:59.660
 a little to free us a little bit of that 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:01.670
 condensation that is going to generate 100 or 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:03.350
 is this going to condense 100 percent 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:05.720
 because it's going to condense first it's going to 

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:07.520
 condense because it's very closed very 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:11.060
 closed we breathe is hot 

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:13.370
 ok let's loose our our steam and 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:15.200
 obviously for making this rain cold in 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:17.510
 rhythm and will compensate what is good 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:19.340
 that it has to condensation if it's going to 

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:21.739
 wet a little but you're not going to plug 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:26.020
 as having nothing is worth that because of 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:26.020
 emergency for a rain storm 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:35.150
 closed and then as I said before we take and 

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:37.580
 we go throwing in this case 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:39.710
 station 18 but let's go what what 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:43.370
 there is on the ground and then I pick it up 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:44.880
 what with the side color to give it a little 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:46.320
 more of the wind 

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:50.220
 this refuge also has a great 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:52.060
 advantage that is that when we take away the 

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:53.980
 door to teach 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:56.200
 it stays totally closed therefore 

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:58.120
 it keeps a little more heat for not 

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:59.650
 say enough more then it 's a bit 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:02.050
 warmer that's why a situation of 

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:04.990
 emergency in a storm situation 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:05.800
 of cold of rains of such then you 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:08.470
 help a lot 

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:10.960
 but as I said it will condense 100% 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:12.400
 and you're going to get wet but it's not the same 

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:14.650
 to have nothing that you do not have anything 

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:16.510
 it enters into hypothermia that a cause 

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:18.910
 very very very unpleasant death and 

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:20.770
 quite common that it is very easy to enter 

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:22.560
 in hypothermia is worth a storm with 

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:25.330
 wet winds 

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:28.340
 It is very easy 

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:30.770
 and obviously, I will protect you 

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:32.600
 of all the inclemencies then it has 

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:35.270
 your good things and your bad things like 

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:36.680
 everything then I do not recommend for a 

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:39.830
 normal eye but rather for some 

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:41.330
 Adhesions the hat will show here 

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:44.700
 in cameras 

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:47.960
 the hat has caught 

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:47.960
 to this branch that is here 

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:56.240
 there it looks is worth the host line 

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:58.490
 up to the hat and this would be here 

00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:01.710
 forgiveness for camera movement 

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:03.870
 would be what would be the fourth and now the 

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:05.880
 I have 

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:07.950
 here with a flexible branch I have it 

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:10.470
 lifted but that this would be lowered 

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:13.380
 it is also worth his thing would be to place here 

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:15.480
 a pickaxe then so that leaving 

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:17.340
 also a little bit raised so that 

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:18.920
 As I said, run a little bit in the air and in 

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:21.180
 if it is very cold and so on 

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:26.240
 had to be anchored or 

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:26.240
 you should be more and anchor it 

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:29.660
 that would be 

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:34.680
 I'm going to show you the other one on the other side 

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:34.680
 day 

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:39.930
 on the other side of calling the 

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:43.710
 sighting 

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:45.470
 something totally sealed against water and 

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:49.280
 here, then 

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:51.650
 so it would be beige so well put 

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:53.540
 on this side very tense then for 

00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:55.360
 avoid a little condensation but that 

00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:59.800
 it is normal to condense because as you see 

00:06:55.360 --> 00:07:02.680
 it has a very very low profile 

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:04.960
 and obviously a person lying here 

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:07.180
 to play especially on this side of 

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:09.639
 here with his body and on that side a 

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:12.159
 person fits perfectly almost almost to the 

00:07:09.639 --> 00:07:13.720
 one hundred percent stretch is worth what happens 

00:07:12.159 --> 00:07:15.550
 is that of course how are you playing because 

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:18.159
 as I say we took you down then this would be 

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:20.470
 I shelter a low profile for emergency and 

00:07:18.159 --> 00:07:22.090
 like I said if there's a big rain and 

00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:23.650
 others and we can get wet or we want 

00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:26.050
 keep much more heat because 

00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:27.610
 would close this plus the ground and 

00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:29.620
 obviously the door also finish 

00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:32.940
 close the walls of a configuration 

00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:32.940
 very good emergency 

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:38.240
 well let's go now to see another 

00:07:35.969 --> 00:07:38.240
 configuration
