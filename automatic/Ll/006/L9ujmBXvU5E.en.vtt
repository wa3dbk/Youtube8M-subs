00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
ipad one moves pretty fast even though

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.700 
ipad one moves pretty fast even though
it's<00:01:59.700> a<00:02:00.240> single<00:02:00.659> process<00:02:01.140> of<00:02:01.229> the<00:02:01.320> store<00:02:01.560> core

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
it's a single process of the store core

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.440 
it's a single process of the store core
processor<00:02:02.159> but<00:02:02.340> it<00:02:02.700> moves<00:02:03.090> pretty<00:02:03.210> fast

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
processor but it moves pretty fast

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.830 
processor but it moves pretty fast
things<00:02:03.899> move<00:02:03.990> smoothly<00:02:04.469> so<00:02:04.799> I<00:02:05.180> I<00:02:06.180> don't<00:02:06.630> think

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
things move smoothly so I I don't think

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.650 
things move smoothly so I I don't think
it's<00:02:06.960> any<00:02:07.290> much<00:02:07.560> difference<00:02:08.009> there<00:02:08.099> arm<00:02:08.660> well

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
it's any much difference there arm well

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:10.969 
it's any much difference there arm well
you<00:02:09.750> do<00:02:09.899> have<00:02:09.929> a<00:02:10.170> couple<00:02:10.440> of<00:02:10.590> things<00:02:10.619> that<00:02:10.920> are

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
you do have a couple of things that are

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.309 
you do have a couple of things that are
different

00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:12.319 
different

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:14.920 
different
on<00:02:12.499> the<00:02:13.189> software<00:02:13.430> side<00:02:13.730> is<00:02:14.180> that<00:02:14.359> there<00:02:14.599> is<00:02:14.749> no

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
on the software side is that there is no

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:16.660 
on the software side is that there is no
facetime<00:02:15.260> of<00:02:15.799> course<00:02:16.040> you<00:02:16.129> have<00:02:16.219> facetime

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
facetime of course you have facetime

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:18.339 
facetime of course you have facetime
because<00:02:17.030> you<00:02:17.150> have<00:02:17.299> a<00:02:17.329> front<00:02:17.629> facing<00:02:17.689> camera

00:02:18.339 --> 00:02:18.349 
because you have a front facing camera

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:21.039 
because you have a front facing camera
and<00:02:18.760> you<00:02:19.760> don't<00:02:20.060> have<00:02:20.150> facetime<00:02:20.599> because<00:02:20.900> it

00:02:21.039 --> 00:02:21.049 
and you don't have facetime because it

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:24.550 
and you don't have facetime because it
is<00:02:21.170> no<00:02:21.349> camera<00:02:21.969> on<00:02:22.969> this<00:02:23.510> device<00:02:23.900> there's<00:02:24.379> also

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
is no camera on this device there's also

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.800 
is no camera on this device there's also
there's<00:02:24.829> no<00:02:24.950> camera<00:02:25.340> at<00:02:25.400> the<00:02:25.459> back<00:02:25.670> here<00:02:25.999> so

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
there's no camera at the back here so

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:29.470 
there's no camera at the back here so
basically<00:02:27.170> you<00:02:27.290> can't<00:02:27.530> take<00:02:27.739> pictures<00:02:28.480> which

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
basically you can't take pictures which

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.199 
basically you can't take pictures which
is<00:02:29.689> the<00:02:29.870> big<00:02:30.079> difference<00:02:30.290> with<00:02:30.799> the<00:02:30.980> ipad<00:02:31.430> 2<00:02:32.000> t

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:32.209 
is the big difference with the ipad 2 t

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:35.199 
is the big difference with the ipad 2 t
ipad<00:02:32.659> 1<00:02:32.930> and<00:02:33.560> everything<00:02:34.099> else<00:02:34.280> feels<00:02:35.120> the

ipad 1 and everything else feels the

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:38.589 
ipad 1 and everything else feels the
same<00:02:35.450> software<00:02:36.019> wise<00:02:36.849> you<00:02:37.849> do<00:02:38.209> have<00:02:38.359> other

same software wise you do have other
software<00:02:39.049> of<00:02:39.109> course<00:02:39.290> that<00:02:39.469> very<00:02:40.189> specific<00:02:40.700> to

00:02:40.899 --> 00:02:40.909 
software of course that very specific to

00:02:40.909 --> 00:02:46.059 
software of course that very specific to
the<00:02:42.549> CD<00:02:43.549> ipad<00:02:43.909> 2<00:02:44.239> when<00:02:45.230> it<00:02:45.349> comes<00:02:45.500> to<00:02:45.650> FaceTime

what it's the user function anyway
overall<00:02:54.980> arm<00:02:55.280> out<00:02:55.849> say<00:02:56.299> yes<00:02:56.599> the<00:02:57.379> ipad<00:02:57.709> 2<00:02:57.919> is

00:02:58.179 --> 00:02:58.189 
overall arm out say yes the ipad 2 is

00:02:58.189 --> 00:03:00.789 
overall arm out say yes the ipad 2 is
thinner<00:02:58.730> and<00:02:59.319> also<00:03:00.319> has<00:03:00.439> a<00:03:00.469> front<00:03:00.769> facing

thinner and also has a front facing

thinner and also has a front facing
camera<00:03:01.459> and<00:03:01.609> ipad<00:03:02.030> one<00:03:02.209> doesn't<00:03:02.629> but<00:03:02.959> the

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
camera and ipad one doesn't but the

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:06.699 
camera and ipad one doesn't but the
similarities<00:03:05.090> between<00:03:05.510> you<00:03:05.719> two<00:03:05.900> devices<00:03:06.169> in

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:06.709 
similarities between you two devices in

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:08.589 
similarities between you two devices in
terms<00:03:07.159> of<00:03:07.280> functionality<00:03:07.669> is<00:03:08.060> pretty<00:03:08.419> much

00:03:08.589 --> 00:03:08.599 
terms of functionality is pretty much

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:12.640 
terms of functionality is pretty much
the<00:03:08.659> same<00:03:08.930> so<00:03:09.199> we<00:03:09.620> run<00:03:09.769> the<00:03:09.859> same<00:03:10.659> iOS<00:03:11.659> software

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.650 
the same so we run the same iOS software

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:18.069 
the same so we run the same iOS software
i<00:03:12.949> think<00:03:13.280> is<00:03:13.370> putting<00:03:13.669> out<00:03:13.760> 4.3<00:03:14.540> and<00:03:14.719> also<00:03:17.079> the

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:18.079 
i think is putting out 4.3 and also the

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:19.839 
i think is putting out 4.3 and also the
only<00:03:18.109> difference<00:03:18.560> is<00:03:18.650> there's<00:03:19.250> a<00:03:19.340> camera<00:03:19.699> at

00:03:19.839 --> 00:03:19.849 
only difference is there's a camera at

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:21.929 
only difference is there's a camera at
its<00:03:20.090> thinner<00:03:20.389> so<00:03:20.720> if<00:03:20.900> you're<00:03:21.049> looking<00:03:21.290> for

00:03:21.929 --> 00:03:21.939 
its thinner so if you're looking for

00:03:21.939 --> 00:03:24.280 
its thinner so if you're looking for
lightweight<00:03:22.939> front-facing<00:03:23.689> camera<00:03:24.139> you

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:24.290 
lightweight front-facing camera you

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:26.770 
lightweight front-facing camera you
video<00:03:24.590> chat<00:03:24.620> a<00:03:24.829> lot<00:03:25.040> boom<00:03:25.549> works<00:03:26.090> for<00:03:26.299> you<00:03:26.329> if

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:26.780 
video chat a lot boom works for you if

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:28.869 
video chat a lot boom works for you if
you<00:03:27.019> don't<00:03:27.349> care<00:03:27.590> and<00:03:27.859> because<00:03:28.250> also<00:03:28.489> prices

00:03:28.869 --> 00:03:28.879 
you don't care and because also prices

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:31.229 
you don't care and because also prices
have<00:03:29.000> dropped<00:03:29.150> this<00:03:29.989> is<00:03:30.199> just<00:03:30.439> as<00:03:30.590> fit<00:03:30.739> as<00:03:30.859> good

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:31.239 
have dropped this is just as fit as good

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:33.249 
have dropped this is just as fit as good
battery<00:03:32.239> life<00:03:32.269> is<00:03:32.419> pretty<00:03:32.750> much<00:03:32.870> around<00:03:33.139> the

00:03:33.249 --> 00:03:33.259 
battery life is pretty much around the

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:34.839 
battery life is pretty much around the
same<00:03:33.500> this<00:03:33.709> is<00:03:33.859> 10<00:03:34.040> hours<00:03:34.250> this<00:03:34.489> is<00:03:34.639> about

00:03:34.839 --> 00:03:34.849 
same this is 10 hours this is about

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:38.170 
same this is 10 hours this is about
eight<00:03:35.530> you<00:03:36.530> know<00:03:36.680> two<00:03:36.979> hours<00:03:37.280> i<00:03:37.489> would<00:03:37.849> say<00:03:37.970> big

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:38.180 
eight you know two hours i would say big

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:40.210 
eight you know two hours i would say big
deal<00:03:38.389> so<00:03:38.870> overall<00:03:39.049> i<00:03:39.290> think<00:03:39.349> you're<00:03:39.949> pretty

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:40.220 
deal so overall i think you're pretty

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:43.149 
deal so overall i think you're pretty
much<00:03:40.370> similar<00:03:41.030> in<00:03:41.329> all<00:03:41.449> respects<00:03:42.069> except<00:03:43.069> the

00:03:43.149 --> 00:03:43.159 
much similar in all respects except the

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:45.939 
much similar in all respects except the
camera<00:03:43.519> and<00:03:43.699> that<00:03:44.689> all<00:03:45.019> depends<00:03:45.349> on<00:03:45.500> if<00:03:45.680> you

00:03:45.939 --> 00:03:45.949 
camera and that all depends on if you

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:47.499 
camera and that all depends on if you
video<00:03:46.280> chatting<00:03:46.609> on<00:03:46.790> so<00:03:47.030> it's<00:03:47.180> one<00:03:47.329> of<00:03:47.419> those

00:03:47.499 --> 00:03:47.509 
video chatting on so it's one of those

00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:49.030 
video chatting on so it's one of those
things<00:03:47.569> where<00:03:47.870> you<00:03:48.019> can<00:03:48.139> look<00:03:48.290> at<00:03:48.470> and<00:03:48.829> of

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:49.040 
things where you can look at and of
