nice<00:02:23.410> saver<00:02:23.850> but<00:02:24.850> I<00:02:24.880> must<00:02:25.120> say<00:02:25.360> I<00:02:25.690> never

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:34.020 
this thing they're about the same size
actually<00:02:31.959> but<00:02:32.440> the<00:02:32.530> blades<00:02:33.030> really

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
about a quarter of inch shorter then you

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:43.280 
about a quarter of inch shorter then you
put<00:02:39.580> on<00:02:39.700> the<00:02:39.790> blades<00:02:40.000> and<00:02:40.209> just<00:02:40.830> does<00:02:41.830> it<00:02:41.920> all
