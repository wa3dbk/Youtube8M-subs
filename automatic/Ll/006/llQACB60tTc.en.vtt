it<00:01:38.939> was<00:01:39.060> more<00:01:39.270> sporadic<00:01:39.930> so<00:01:40.140> it<00:01:40.229> wasn't<00:01:40.560> like

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
it was more sporadic so it wasn't like

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.969 
it was more sporadic so it wasn't like
every<00:01:41.070> day<00:01:41.310> but<00:01:42.240> I<00:01:42.299> got<00:01:42.570> the<00:01:42.780> deal<00:01:43.409> to<00:01:43.649> take<00:01:43.829> you

from<00:01:44.009> a<00:01:44.520> youtuber<00:01:45.860> this<00:01:46.860> is<00:01:47.040> msn<00:01:47.759> it's<00:01:48.479> a

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
from a youtuber this is msn it's a

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.749 
from a youtuber this is msn it's a
natural<00:01:48.840> form<00:01:49.350> of<00:01:49.530> sulfur<00:01:50.070> that's<00:01:50.490> in<00:01:50.640> our

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
natural form of sulfur that's in our

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.240 
natural form of sulfur that's in our
food<00:01:51.149> but<00:01:51.570> the<00:01:51.810> food<00:01:52.049> in<00:01:52.350> the<00:01:52.710> food<00:01:52.890> we<00:01:53.070> don't

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
food but the food in the food we don't

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.609 
food but the food in the food we don't
get<00:01:53.399> a<00:01:53.430> lot<00:01:53.520> of<00:01:53.670> because<00:01:54.090> it<00:01:54.240> cooks<00:01:54.509> out<00:01:54.840> but

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
get a lot of because it cooks out but

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.670 
get a lot of because it cooks out but
MSM<00:01:56.750> naturally<00:01:57.750> lengthens<00:01:58.229> your<00:01:58.290> hair's

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
MSM naturally lengthens your hair's

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.270 
MSM naturally lengthens your hair's
growth<00:01:59.250> phase<00:01:59.610> so<00:02:00.570> I<00:02:01.020> think<00:02:01.380> it<00:02:01.829> has

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
growth phase so I think it has

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.310 
growth phase so I think it has
contributed<00:02:02.790> to<00:02:03.240> me<00:02:03.420> growing<00:02:03.810> my<00:02:04.049> hair<00:02:04.079> out

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
contributed to me growing my hair out

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.730 
contributed to me growing my hair out
faster<00:02:05.040> here<00:02:05.509> then<00:02:06.509> silicon<00:02:07.079> just<00:02:07.380> started

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
faster here then silicon just started

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.529 
faster here then silicon just started
taking<00:02:08.099> that<00:02:08.250> within<00:02:08.520> the<00:02:08.729> past<00:02:09.000> month<00:02:09.179> I

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
taking that within the past month I

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.620 
taking that within the past month I
probably<00:02:09.780> only<00:02:10.050> taken<00:02:10.470> like<00:02:10.619> 1000

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:11.630 
probably only taken like 1000

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:14.080 
probably only taken like 1000
or<00:02:11.720> but<00:02:12.470> it's<00:02:12.620> good<00:02:12.830> for<00:02:13.070> almost<00:02:13.310> every<00:02:13.700> system

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090
