00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:09.460 
and then this microphone will go here it

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:11.820 
and then this microphone will go here it
will<00:02:09.580> pick<00:02:09.789> up<00:02:09.940> both<00:02:10.119> my<00:02:10.330> voice<00:02:10.569> and<00:02:10.899> the<00:02:11.560> sound

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:46.530 
coming up soon so here's a shot of the
apartment<00:02:44.769> this<00:02:44.860> is<00:02:44.920> where<00:02:45.220> I<00:02:45.250> film<00:02:45.760> now<00:02:46.480> you

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
apartment this is where I film now you

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:48.150 
apartment this is where I film now you
may<00:02:46.720> have<00:02:46.840> noticed<00:02:47.230> we<00:02:47.410> have<00:02:47.560> a<00:02:47.590> crib<00:02:47.920> we're

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.160 
may have noticed we have a crib we're

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.270 
may have noticed we have a crib we're
actually<00:02:48.280> expecting<00:02:48.820> a<00:02:49.390> baby<00:02:50.140> and<00:02:50.500> five<00:02:50.860> weeks

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
actually expecting a baby and five weeks

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.460 
actually expecting a baby and five weeks
partly<00:02:52.120> why<00:02:52.269> I'm<00:02:52.330> filming<00:02:52.780> this<00:02:52.810> video<00:02:53.050> now

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
partly why I'm filming this video now

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:55.830 
partly why I'm filming this video now
since<00:02:54.160> things<00:02:54.790> probably<00:02:54.970> won't<00:02:55.239> be<00:02:55.360> too<00:02:55.540> tidy

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
since things probably won't be too tidy

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.259 
since things probably won't be too tidy
after<00:02:56.260> that<00:02:56.410> we're<00:02:57.040> actually<00:02:57.130> expecting<00:02:58.000> a

00:02:58.259 --> 00:02:58.269 
after that we're actually expecting a

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:00.420 
after that we're actually expecting a
girl<00:02:58.510> though<00:02:58.750> in<00:02:59.050> five<00:02:59.470> weeks<00:02:59.709> time<00:03:00.040> so<00:03:00.280> we're

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
girl though in five weeks time so we're

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:10.470 
girl though in five weeks time so we're
very<00:03:00.459> excited<00:03:00.850> about<00:03:01.300> that

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.330 

so<00:03:11.480> I<00:03:11.510> record<00:03:12.080> the<00:03:12.350> video<00:03:12.710> and<00:03:13.010> the<00:03:13.310> audio

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.340 
so I record the video and the audio

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:16.630 
so I record the video and the audio
separately<00:03:14.240> first<00:03:14.900> of<00:03:15.140> all<00:03:15.260> I'll<00:03:15.560> work<00:03:16.310> on<00:03:16.490> the

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:16.640 
separately first of all I'll work on the

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:18.970 
separately first of all I'll work on the
audio<00:03:17.000> and<00:03:17.360> I<00:03:17.480> do<00:03:17.540> that<00:03:17.840> in<00:03:17.930> logic<00:03:18.380> so<00:03:18.830> we're

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:18.980 
audio and I do that in logic so we're

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:21.190 
audio and I do that in logic so we're
looking<00:03:19.100> at<00:03:19.310> logic<00:03:19.760> right<00:03:19.940> now<00:03:20.210> so<00:03:21.050> what

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200 
looking at logic right now so what

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:22.930 
looking at logic right now so what
you're<00:03:21.320> looking<00:03:21.560> at<00:03:21.620> is<00:03:21.830> the<00:03:22.070> audio<00:03:22.490> from<00:03:22.760> one

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:22.940 
you're looking at is the audio from one

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:25.480 
you're looking at is the audio from one
of<00:03:23.030> my<00:03:23.180> lessons<00:03:23.830> sometimes<00:03:24.830> you<00:03:25.040> don't<00:03:25.250> get

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:25.490 
of my lessons sometimes you don't get

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:28.630 
of my lessons sometimes you don't get
the<00:03:25.610> complete<00:03:25.880> to<00:03:26.180> buy<00:03:26.390> one<00:03:27.370> you'll<00:03:28.370> just<00:03:28.460> get

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:28.640 
the complete to buy one you'll just get

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:31.330 
the complete to buy one you'll just get
the<00:03:28.760> 25<00:03:29.360> and<00:03:29.720> you<00:03:30.200> might<00:03:30.350> be<00:03:30.500> surprised<00:03:30.920> over

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.340 
the 25 and you might be surprised over

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:34.000 
the 25 and you might be surprised over
here<00:03:31.520> to<00:03:31.700> see<00:03:31.880> just<00:03:32.210> how<00:03:32.360> many<00:03:32.540> effects<00:03:33.110> I<00:03:33.470> put

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.010 
here to see just how many effects I put

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:36.820 
here to see just how many effects I put
the<00:03:34.220> audio<00:03:34.550> through<00:03:34.970> so<00:03:35.930> mostly<00:03:36.230> all<00:03:36.500> of<00:03:36.650> these

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:36.830 
the audio through so mostly all of these

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:38.920 
the audio through so mostly all of these
effects<00:03:37.250> down<00:03:37.520> the<00:03:37.730> side<00:03:37.970> which<00:03:38.270> this<00:03:38.480> audio

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:38.930 
effects down the side which this audio

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:40.900 
effects down the side which this audio
is<00:03:39.140> going<00:03:39.350> through<00:03:39.770> most<00:03:40.490> of<00:03:40.610> these<00:03:40.730> are

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:40.910 
is going through most of these are

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:42.850 
is going through most of these are
compressors<00:03:41.540> so<00:03:42.050> these<00:03:42.170> are<00:03:42.230> two<00:03:42.380> compressors

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:42.860 
compressors so these are two compressors

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:44.949 
compressors so these are two compressors
you<00:03:43.310> don't<00:03:43.580> get<00:03:43.760> the<00:03:43.910> complete<00:03:44.180> to<00:03:44.480> buy<00:03:44.690> one

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:44.959 
you don't get the complete to buy one

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:47.140 
you don't get the complete to buy one
and<00:03:45.709> basically<00:03:46.070> what<00:03:46.280> these<00:03:46.400> compressors<00:03:46.820> do

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:47.150 
and basically what these compressors do

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:49.270 
and basically what these compressors do
is<00:03:47.240> they<00:03:47.360> compress<00:03:47.930> the<00:03:48.350> loudness<00:03:48.620> so

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:49.280 
is they compress the loudness so

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:50.710 
is they compress the loudness so
anything<00:03:49.610> that's<00:03:49.760> really<00:03:50.270> loud<00:03:50.420> they'll

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:50.720 
anything that's really loud they'll

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:52.240 
anything that's really loud they'll
crush<00:03:51.020> them<00:03:51.320> down<00:03:51.500> so<00:03:51.770> that<00:03:51.800> everything's

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:52.250 
crush them down so that everything's

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:54.750 
crush them down so that everything's
quite<00:03:52.520> consistently<00:03:53.300> the<00:03:53.720> same<00:03:53.750> loudness

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:54.760 
quite consistently the same loudness

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:57.100 
quite consistently the same loudness
sometimes<00:03:55.760> you<00:03:55.940> don't<00:03:56.150> get<00:03:56.390> the<00:03:56.540> complete<00:03:56.810> to

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:57.110 
sometimes you don't get the complete to

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:00.820 
sometimes you don't get the complete to
buy<00:03:57.320> one<00:03:58.240> you<00:03:59.240> just<00:03:59.270> get<00:03:59.570> the<00:03:59.660> 25<00:04:00.260> and<00:04:00.620> the

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:00.830 
buy one you just get the 25 and the

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:03.100 
buy one you just get the 25 and the
other<00:04:00.980> thing<00:04:01.070> I<00:04:01.340> do<00:04:01.400> is<00:04:01.700> a<00:04:01.730> lot<00:04:01.940> of<00:04:02.090> e<00:04:02.240> queuing<00:04:02.930> I

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:03.110 
other thing I do is a lot of e queuing I

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:06.010 
other thing I do is a lot of e queuing I
have<00:04:03.830> to<00:04:03.980> dip<00:04:04.220> certain<00:04:04.820> frequencies<00:04:05.540> often<00:04:05.900> in

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:06.020 
have to dip certain frequencies often in

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:08.590 
have to dip certain frequencies often in
the<00:04:06.110> mid-range<00:04:06.320> maybe<00:04:07.280> after<00:04:07.640> boost<00:04:07.970> certain

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:08.600 
the mid-range maybe after boost certain

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:10.690 
the mid-range maybe after boost certain
parts<00:04:08.990> sometimes<00:04:09.560> I<00:04:09.920> have<00:04:10.070> to<00:04:10.190> dip<00:04:10.459> these

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:10.700 
parts sometimes I have to dip these

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:12.640 
parts sometimes I have to dip these
specific<00:04:11.420> frequencies<00:04:12.110> where<00:04:12.380> you<00:04:12.470> get<00:04:12.620> a

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:12.650 
specific frequencies where you get a

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:14.949 
specific frequencies where you get a
resonant<00:04:13.250> frequency<00:04:13.910> where<00:04:14.120> a<00:04:14.150> certain<00:04:14.660> note

00:04:14.949 --> 00:04:14.959 
resonant frequency where a certain note

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:17.530 
resonant frequency where a certain note
is<00:04:15.170> just<00:04:15.350> really<00:04:15.769> really<00:04:15.950> loud<00:04:16.220> five<00:04:16.940> and<00:04:17.390> then

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:17.540 
is just really really loud five and then

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:20.860 
is just really really loud five and then
all<00:04:17.660> go<00:04:17.840> somewhere<00:04:18.290> else<00:04:19.120> so<00:04:20.120> that's<00:04:20.450> a<00:04:20.600> lot<00:04:20.840> of

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:20.870 
all go somewhere else so that's a lot of

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:23.350 
all go somewhere else so that's a lot of
effects<00:04:21.410> that<00:04:21.560> the<00:04:22.010> audio<00:04:22.490> has<00:04:22.790> to<00:04:22.970> go<00:04:23.120> through

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:23.360 
effects that the audio has to go through

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:34.610 
effects that the audio has to go through
before<00:04:23.570> I<00:04:24.200> even<00:04:24.470> sync<00:04:25.010> it<00:04:25.160> up<00:04:25.280> with<00:04:25.520> the<00:04:25.640> video

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:34.620 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:37.350 

so<00:04:35.620> now<00:04:35.740> we're<00:04:35.950> inside<00:04:36.220> the<00:04:36.280> film<00:04:36.850> editing

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:37.360 
so now we're inside the film editing

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:38.940 
so now we're inside the film editing
software<00:04:37.870> which<00:04:38.020> I<00:04:38.140> use<00:04:38.380> which<00:04:38.620> is<00:04:38.740> called

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:38.950 
software which I use which is called

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:42.210 
software which I use which is called
premier<00:04:39.520> by<00:04:40.000> Adobe<00:04:40.630> now<00:04:41.470> back<00:04:41.770> in<00:04:41.920> the<00:04:42.040> day<00:04:42.190> I

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:42.220 
premier by Adobe now back in the day I

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:44.820 
premier by Adobe now back in the day I
used<00:04:42.370> to<00:04:42.670> use<00:04:42.880> iMovie<00:04:43.750> which<00:04:44.140> is<00:04:44.260> just<00:04:44.350> a<00:04:44.500> free

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:44.830 
used to use iMovie which is just a free

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:47.580 
used to use iMovie which is just a free
movie<00:04:45.370> software<00:04:45.820> which<00:04:45.940> comes<00:04:46.240> with<00:04:46.420> an<00:04:46.960> apple

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:47.590 
movie software which comes with an apple

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:49.620 
movie software which comes with an apple
computer<00:04:47.680> however<00:04:48.520> I<00:04:49.000> didn't<00:04:49.360> have<00:04:49.450> much

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:49.630 
computer however I didn't have much

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:52.380 
computer however I didn't have much
control<00:04:49.870> over<00:04:50.170> the<00:04:50.590> color<00:04:50.890> and<00:04:51.330> there<00:04:52.330> were

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:52.390 
control over the color and there were

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:54.120 
control over the color and there were
several<00:04:52.630> problems<00:04:52.930> where<00:04:53.380> my<00:04:53.710> hands<00:04:53.950> would

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:54.130 
several problems where my hands would

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:56.490 
several problems where my hands would
look<00:04:54.310> really<00:04:54.520> red<00:04:54.790> and<00:04:54.940> the<00:04:55.660> reason<00:04:56.020> is<00:04:56.230> that<00:04:56.260> I

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:56.500 
look really red and the reason is that I

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:58.110 
look really red and the reason is that I
couldn't<00:04:56.860> control<00:04:56.980> the<00:04:57.250> saturation<00:04:57.880> very

00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:58.120 
couldn't control the saturation very

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:00.450 
couldn't control the saturation very
well<00:04:58.330> in<00:04:58.540> iMovie<00:04:59.530> and<00:04:59.710> just<00:05:00.010> took<00:05:00.100> me<00:05:00.250> a<00:05:00.280> long

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:00.460 
well in iMovie and just took me a long

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:02.370 
well in iMovie and just took me a long
time<00:05:00.520> to<00:05:00.880> get<00:05:01.210> the<00:05:01.360> hang<00:05:01.510> of<00:05:01.690> how<00:05:01.750> to<00:05:01.930> get<00:05:02.230> the

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:02.380 
time to get the hang of how to get the

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:04.800 
time to get the hang of how to get the
color<00:05:02.590> right<00:05:02.680> so<00:05:03.520> with<00:05:03.880> premier<00:05:04.390> you<00:05:04.630> have<00:05:04.780> a

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:04.810 
color right so with premier you have a

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:07.320 
color right so with premier you have a
lot<00:05:05.020> more<00:05:05.170> control<00:05:05.590> over<00:05:05.980> the<00:05:06.370> color<00:05:06.610> and<00:05:06.910> also

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:07.330 
lot more control over the color and also

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:09.150 
lot more control over the color and also
everything<00:05:07.870> else<00:05:08.050> so<00:05:08.680> here's<00:05:08.890> one<00:05:09.040> of<00:05:09.130> the

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:09.160 
everything else so here's one of the

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:11.070 
everything else so here's one of the
videos<00:05:09.520> from<00:05:09.760> the<00:05:09.910> musical<00:05:10.270> aircon<00:05:10.810> that<00:05:11.020> I've

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:11.080 
videos from the musical aircon that I've

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:13.350 
videos from the musical aircon that I've
been<00:05:11.230> working<00:05:11.620> on<00:05:11.680> as<00:05:11.890> you<00:05:12.490> can<00:05:12.610> see<00:05:12.940> there's<00:05:13.300> a

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:13.360 
been working on as you can see there's a

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:15.750 
been working on as you can see there's a
lot<00:05:13.660> of<00:05:13.690> editing<00:05:14.410> there's<00:05:14.680> a<00:05:14.740> lot<00:05:14.890> of<00:05:14.920> small

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:15.760 
lot of editing there's a lot of small

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:17.700 
lot of editing there's a lot of small
cuts<00:05:16.150> which<00:05:16.450> I<00:05:16.600> do<00:05:16.660> sometimes<00:05:17.080> I<00:05:17.380> cut<00:05:17.590> the

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:17.710 
cuts which I do sometimes I cut the

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:30.360 
cuts which I do sometimes I cut the
audio<00:05:18.040> sometimes<00:05:18.940> I<00:05:19.060> cut<00:05:19.270> just<00:05:19.510> the<00:05:19.630> image<00:05:29.370> now

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:30.370 
audio sometimes I cut just the image now

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:32.310 
audio sometimes I cut just the image now
in<00:05:30.460> case<00:05:30.580> you<00:05:30.730> were<00:05:30.820> wondering<00:05:31.000> all<00:05:31.870> of<00:05:32.200> the

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:32.320 
in case you were wondering all of the

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:34.560 
in case you were wondering all of the
music<00:05:32.500> which<00:05:32.890> i<00:05:33.100> use<00:05:33.520> in<00:05:33.940> all<00:05:34.240> of<00:05:34.420> my

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:34.570 
music which i use in all of my

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:37.650 
music which i use in all of my
interludes<00:05:35.200> is<00:05:35.620> all<00:05:36.220> composed<00:05:36.940> by<00:05:37.210> me<00:05:37.450> it's

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:37.660 
interludes is all composed by me it's

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:39.750 
interludes is all composed by me it's
all<00:05:37.780> produced<00:05:38.260> by<00:05:38.470> me<00:05:38.680> over<00:05:39.190> the<00:05:39.280> years<00:05:39.520> I've

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:39.760 
all produced by me over the years I've

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:42.900 
all produced by me over the years I've
composed<00:05:40.180> many<00:05:40.540> tracks<00:05:40.990> for<00:05:41.410> my<00:05:41.680> videos<00:05:42.100> I've

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:42.910 
composed many tracks for my videos I've

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:44.220 
composed many tracks for my videos I've
got<00:05:43.090> to<00:05:43.210> the<00:05:43.300> point<00:05:43.480> where<00:05:43.720> I<00:05:43.750> have<00:05:43.960> quite<00:05:44.170> a

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:44.230 
got to the point where I have quite a

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:47.220 
got to the point where I have quite a
large<00:05:44.620> music<00:05:45.160> library<00:05:46.000> and<00:05:46.270> I<00:05:46.720> basically<00:05:46.990> just

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:47.230 
large music library and I basically just

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:49.230 
large music library and I basically just
choose<00:05:47.620> from<00:05:47.830> all<00:05:47.980> these<00:05:48.130> tracks<00:05:48.550> and<00:05:48.850> the

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:49.240 
choose from all these tracks and the

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:50.730 
choose from all these tracks and the
idea<00:05:49.570> is<00:05:49.630> that<00:05:49.720> these<00:05:49.960> pieces<00:05:50.410> of<00:05:50.620> music

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:50.740 
idea is that these pieces of music

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:53.100 
idea is that these pieces of music
always<00:05:51.300> demonstrate<00:05:52.300> the<00:05:52.450> concepts<00:05:52.930> which

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:53.110 
always demonstrate the concepts which

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:55.350 
always demonstrate the concepts which
I'm<00:05:53.260> talking<00:05:53.590> about<00:05:53.650> in<00:05:53.890> the<00:05:53.980> videos<00:05:54.340> so<00:05:54.880> i<00:05:54.910> can

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:55.360 
I'm talking about in the videos so i can

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:57.600 
I'm talking about in the videos so i can
