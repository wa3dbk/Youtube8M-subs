out<00:02:24.760> and<00:02:25.760> then<00:02:25.880> I<00:02:25.910> have<00:02:26.030> a<00:02:26.060> plate<00:02:26.300> ready<00:02:26.540> so

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.050 
out and then I have a plate ready so

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:29.590 
out and then I have a plate ready so
once<00:02:27.290> I<00:02:27.470> once<00:02:28.040> I<00:02:28.220> roll<00:02:28.430> up<00:02:28.459> the<00:02:28.760> cookie<00:02:29.120> I'm

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:29.600 
once I once I roll up the cookie I'm

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.020 
once I once I roll up the cookie I'm
gonna<00:02:29.990> have<00:02:30.230> stuff<00:02:30.800> on<00:02:30.950> the<00:02:31.010> plate<00:02:31.250> and<00:02:31.550> then

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
gonna have stuff on the plate and then

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:33.670 
gonna have stuff on the plate and then
they're<00:02:32.180> gonna<00:02:32.270> go<00:02:32.480> into<00:02:32.720> the<00:02:32.840> oil<00:02:33.140> that<00:02:33.620> I

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
they're gonna go into the oil that I

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.150 
they're gonna go into the oil that I
have<00:02:33.980> heating<00:02:34.430> up<00:02:34.550> on<00:02:34.670> medium<00:02:35.060> and<00:02:35.590> then<00:02:36.590> after

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160 
have heating up on medium and then after

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:38.500 
have heating up on medium and then after
there<00:02:37.310> they're<00:02:37.730> fried<00:02:37.940> in<00:02:37.970> the<00:02:38.180> oil<00:02:38.330> they're

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
there they're fried in the oil they're

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.660 
there they're fried in the oil they're
gonna<00:02:38.600> go<00:02:38.810> sit<00:02:39.020> in<00:02:39.140> the<00:02:39.650> honey<00:02:40.010> for<00:02:40.340> a<00:02:40.400> little

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
gonna go sit in the honey for a little

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:43.600 
gonna go sit in the honey for a little
while<00:02:40.870> to<00:02:41.870> absorb<00:02:42.020> the<00:02:42.530> honey<00:02:42.770> and<00:02:43.070> then<00:02:43.280> they

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:43.610 
while to absorb the honey and then they

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:46.690 
while to absorb the honey and then they
will<00:02:43.820> go<00:02:43.940> over<00:02:44.240> here<00:02:44.830> onto<00:02:45.830> the<00:02:46.070> cooling<00:02:46.489> rack

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700 
will go over here onto the cooling rack

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.840 
will go over here onto the cooling rack
and<00:02:47.860> I'll<00:02:48.860> let<00:02:48.980> some<00:02:49.220> of<00:02:49.310> the<00:02:49.370> excess<00:02:49.640> honey

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:49.850 
and I'll let some of the excess honey

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:54.040 
and I'll let some of the excess honey
drip<00:02:50.090> off<00:02:50.270> and<00:02:52.300> so<00:02:53.300> what<00:02:53.420> I've<00:02:53.510> done<00:02:53.660> has<00:02:53.840> made

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:54.050 
drip off and so what I've done has made

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:57.610 
drip off and so what I've done has made
a<00:02:54.080> ball<00:02:54.970> of<00:02:55.970> the<00:02:56.209> almond<00:02:57.140> mixture<00:02:57.290> for<00:02:57.590> the

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
a ball of the almond mixture for the

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:00.550 
a ball of the almond mixture for the
inside<00:02:57.980> it's<00:02:58.280> about<00:02:58.810> this<00:02:59.810> size<00:03:00.019> you<00:03:00.230> can<00:03:00.380> see

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
inside it's about this size you can see

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.940 
inside it's about this size you can see
how<00:03:00.680> big<00:03:00.860> it<00:03:01.010> is<00:03:01.100> and<00:03:01.489> holding<00:03:01.970> in<00:03:02.120> my<00:03:02.330> fingers

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950 
how big it is and holding in my fingers

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:06.490 
how big it is and holding in my fingers
and<00:03:03.950> then<00:03:04.340> I've<00:03:04.670> taken<00:03:04.970> one<00:03:05.450> of<00:03:05.750> the<00:03:06.110> strips

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
and then I've taken one of the strips

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:09.340 
and then I've taken one of the strips
and<00:03:06.890> I'm<00:03:07.850> just<00:03:08.090> going<00:03:08.420> to<00:03:08.480> set<00:03:08.870> it<00:03:09.019> in<00:03:09.170> the

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:09.350 
and I'm just going to set it in the

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:13.030 
and I'm just going to set it in the
corner<00:03:10.330> here<00:03:11.330> and<00:03:11.530> then<00:03:12.530> I'm<00:03:12.620> going<00:03:12.739> to<00:03:12.800> start

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040 
corner here and then I'm going to start

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:14.949 
corner here and then I'm going to start
at<00:03:13.100> this<00:03:13.220> edge<00:03:13.519> and<00:03:13.790> I'm<00:03:13.970> going<00:03:14.120> to<00:03:14.180> fold<00:03:14.540> it<00:03:14.780> in

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:14.959 
at this edge and I'm going to fold it in

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:17.920 
at this edge and I'm going to fold it in
up<00:03:15.170> in<00:03:15.350> a<00:03:15.440> triangle<00:03:15.860> and<00:03:16.269> then<00:03:17.269> I'm<00:03:17.540> gonna<00:03:17.660> fold

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930 
up in a triangle and then I'm gonna fold

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:20.949 
up in a triangle and then I'm gonna fold
it<00:03:18.140> up<00:03:18.260> into<00:03:18.680> another<00:03:19.160> triangle<00:03:19.730> and<00:03:20.480> I'm<00:03:20.780> just

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:20.959 
it up into another triangle and I'm just

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:22.360 
it up into another triangle and I'm just
going<00:03:21.080> to<00:03:21.110> continue<00:03:21.290> doing<00:03:21.739> this<00:03:21.860> tucking<00:03:22.250> in

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:22.370 
going to continue doing this tucking in

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:24.759 
going to continue doing this tucking in
the<00:03:22.459> edges<00:03:22.760> a<00:03:22.790> little<00:03:22.880> bit<00:03:23.120> until<00:03:23.930> you<00:03:24.410> end<00:03:24.620> up

00:03:24.759 --> 00:03:24.769 
the edges a little bit until you end up

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:27.190 
the edges a little bit until you end up
with<00:03:25.070> the<00:03:25.700> final<00:03:26.060> shape<00:03:26.269> and<00:03:26.900> I'll<00:03:27.019> show<00:03:27.170> you

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:27.200 
with the final shape and I'll show you

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:30.520 
with the final shape and I'll show you
that<00:03:28.239> so<00:03:29.239> when<00:03:29.450> you<00:03:29.540> finish<00:03:29.750> the<00:03:30.049> cookie<00:03:30.320> it

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.530 
that so when you finish the cookie it

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:33.280 
that so when you finish the cookie it
will<00:03:30.739> look<00:03:30.980> like<00:03:31.010> that<00:03:31.780> and<00:03:32.780> you<00:03:32.930> can<00:03:33.079> do<00:03:33.140> it<00:03:33.170> a

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:33.290 
will look like that and you can do it a

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:34.509 
will look like that and you can do it a
lot<00:03:33.440> tighter<00:03:33.709> than<00:03:33.860> that<00:03:34.040> this<00:03:34.340> one<00:03:34.489> I

00:03:34.509 --> 00:03:34.519 
lot tighter than that this one I

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:37.569 
lot tighter than that this one I
adjusted<00:03:35.120> with<00:03:35.329> one<00:03:35.540> hand<00:03:36.220> excess<00:03:37.220> read<00:03:37.459> the

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:37.579 
adjusted with one hand excess read the

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:39.759 
adjusted with one hand excess read the
tape<00:03:37.760> while<00:03:38.000> I<00:03:38.030> did<00:03:38.239> it<00:03:38.390> so<00:03:39.230> if<00:03:39.380> you<00:03:39.470> did<00:03:39.650> it

00:03:39.759 --> 00:03:39.769 
tape while I did it so if you did it

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:41.380 
tape while I did it so if you did it
with<00:03:39.860> two<00:03:39.920> hands<00:03:40.310> you<00:03:40.430> can<00:03:40.670> do<00:03:41.000> them<00:03:41.180> a<00:03:41.209> lot

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:41.390 
with two hands you can do them a lot

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:44.530 
with two hands you can do them a lot
tighter<00:03:41.890> and<00:03:42.890> get<00:03:43.310> them<00:03:43.459> a<00:03:43.489> little<00:03:43.700> closer

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:44.540 
tighter and get them a little closer

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:45.009 
tighter and get them a little closer
together

00:03:45.009 --> 00:03:45.019 
together

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:47.110 
together
I<00:03:45.110> also<00:03:45.260> brush<00:03:46.010> the<00:03:46.160> tip<00:03:46.340> with<00:03:46.519> some<00:03:46.790> water

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120 
I also brush the tip with some water

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:51.009 
I also brush the tip with some water
that<00:03:47.660> I<00:03:47.690> have<00:03:47.840> over<00:03:48.110> here<00:03:48.820> just<00:03:49.820> to<00:03:50.150> close<00:03:50.780> in

00:03:51.009 --> 00:03:51.019 
that I have over here just to close in

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:52.840 
that I have over here just to close in
the<00:03:51.140> end<00:03:51.350> so<00:03:51.709> that<00:03:51.739> when<00:03:52.010> I<00:03:52.070> do<00:03:52.220> put<00:03:52.549> it<00:03:52.640> in<00:03:52.730> the

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:52.850 
the end so that when I do put it in the

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:56.110 
the end so that when I do put it in the
oil<00:03:52.880> it's<00:03:53.840> not<00:03:54.230> gonna<00:03:54.500> have<00:03:55.280> a<00:03:55.579> bunch<00:03:55.790> of<00:03:55.940> loose

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:56.120 
oil it's not gonna have a bunch of loose

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:58.810 
oil it's not gonna have a bunch of loose
ends<00:03:56.360> that<00:03:56.540> are<00:03:56.630> hanging<00:03:56.870> off<00:03:57.110> and<00:03:57.530> and<00:03:57.820> frying

00:03:58.810 --> 00:03:58.820 
ends that are hanging off and and frying

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:00.940 
ends that are hanging off and and frying
up<00:03:59.110> just<00:04:00.110> makes<00:04:00.290> it<00:04:00.410> look<00:04:00.530> a<00:04:00.560> little<00:04:00.739> bit

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:00.950 
up just makes it look a little bit

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:03.010 
up just makes it look a little bit
prettier
