00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
lag at all so I was having to drop it

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:32.359 
lag at all so I was having to drop it
down<00:00:26.939> to<00:00:27.000> normal<00:00:27.890> view<00:00:28.890> distance<00:00:30.740> but<00:00:31.740> doing

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
down to normal view distance but doing

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.860 
down to normal view distance but doing
this<00:00:33.210> fix<00:00:33.780> will<00:00:34.350> actually<00:00:35.010> allow<00:00:35.190> you<00:00:35.399> to<00:00:35.870> have

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
actually put the view distance up to

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.040 
actually put the view distance up to
extreme<00:00:44.960> now<00:00:46.550> it<00:00:47.550> does<00:00:47.850> work<00:00:48.120> on<00:00:48.390> service<00:00:48.809> just

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
extreme now it does work on service just

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.900 
extreme now it does work on service just
tested<00:00:49.530> it<00:00:49.620> as<00:00:50.120> see<00:00:51.120> here<00:00:52.640> the<00:00:53.640> only

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
tested it as see here the only

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.760 
tested it as see here the only
difference<00:00:54.270> is<00:00:54.710> minecraft<00:00:55.710> will<00:00:57.289> change<00:00:58.289> too

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
difference is minecraft will change too

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.380 
difference is minecraft will change too
Tekkit<00:00:59.550> and<00:01:00.379> tech<00:01:01.379> it<00:01:01.649> will<00:01:02.100> be<00:01:02.280> nothing<00:01:02.520> so

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
Tekkit and tech it will be nothing so

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.350 
Tekkit and tech it will be nothing so
basically<00:01:03.629> you're<00:01:04.439> moving<00:01:04.799> Tekkit<00:01:05.280> to<00:01:06.180> your

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
basically you're moving Tekkit to your

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.960 
basically you're moving Tekkit to your
minecraft<00:01:07.220> using<00:01:08.220> the<00:01:08.310> launcher<00:01:08.820> that

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
minecraft using the launcher that

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.789 
minecraft using the launcher that
minecraft<00:01:09.210> uses<00:01:09.900> and<00:01:11.630> basically<00:01:12.630> moving<00:01:13.560> it

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
minecraft uses and basically moving it

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.050 
minecraft uses and basically moving it
all<00:01:13.890> out<00:01:14.070> of<00:01:14.189> Tekkit<00:01:14.580> and<00:01:14.670> you<00:01:14.729> won't<00:01:14.880> need<00:01:15.000> to

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
all out of Tekkit and you won't need to

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.190 
all out of Tekkit and you won't need to
take<00:01:15.270> it<00:01:15.420> anymore<00:01:15.630> but<00:01:16.590> it<00:01:16.710> works<00:01:17.090> Aztec<00:01:18.090> it<00:01:18.299> I

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
take it anymore but it works Aztec it I

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.530 
take it anymore but it works Aztec it I
don't<00:01:20.189> think<00:01:20.490> it<00:01:20.610> will<00:01:20.670> connect<00:01:21.000> to<00:01:21.090> normal

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
don't think it will connect to normal

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.120 
don't think it will connect to normal
