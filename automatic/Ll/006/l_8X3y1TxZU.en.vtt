00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.640
 Y 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.180
 yes 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.350
 it seems to chase me like the picture 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:46.030
 death but I did not understand what 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:49.300
 it meant the mourning in which 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:52.930
 it meant at no time when 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:55.620
 someone died remembering when the 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:55.620
 grandpa died 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:00.870
 and they had to get me out of the meeting 

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:04.110
 because he talked a lot 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:06.720
 I was very foolish and I have the best 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:10.080
 memories and equally their children in 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:13.290
 aunts because I lived with them 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:16.610
 and in that time, I started to take 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.610
 know the value of music 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.830
 because they played the piano 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:27.500
 other violin 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.500
 with the guitar 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.830
 but what fascinated me most was 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:35.480
 hear 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:37.640
 when they will interpret the state 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:39.840
 in the ninth symphony I remember so much 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:42.880
 with the heroic 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:45.510
 also in mozart and the 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.510
 famous gatherings 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.040
 be in the house that did not go to the 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.920
 street because 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:59.210
 you had to be afraid of death to the 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:03.280
 of death because there was violence 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:06.010
 the violence came to a post 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:09.240
 on the part of the police that at that time 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:09.240
 the chulavitas are demanded 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.660
 chasing the old ones of gaitÃ¡n 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:20.290
 of them because some brave fell 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:22.830
 children 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:25.310
 I remember a lot 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:27.880
 the image that I saw of 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.880
 of the dead 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:34.139
 killed by the question of some 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:36.450
 choices that have been made and remember 

00:02:34.139 --> 00:02:38.579
 that the next day because of restless said in the 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:42.530
 house that did not come out because there was 

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:42.530
 violence was accompanying me 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:49.070
 the coffins 

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:52.280
 I remember so many people loaded 

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:55.660
 each coffin of the shoulders because no 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:58.360
 there was a funeral home like the one I have 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:00.310
 and arriving at the cemetery because the 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:01.990
 police started firing and people 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:04.660
 he was scared 

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:07.450
 they dropped the drawers and I have the 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:10.069
 image of how the drawers that fell 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:11.900
 the lid came out 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:14.829
 from the base 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:17.450
 and live the arms and hands on the outside 

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:19.870
 and then when I saw that thing 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:22.480
 I was like my 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:26.080
 it's scary that the police and it comes out 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:28.440
 running for the house but that's not what 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:28.440
 I can forget 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:34.290
 and he told me one day I'm going to see what it is that 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:38.210
 happens in the cemetery and I went to 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:40.190
 night cemetery 

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:41.670
 and there I would lie down in the tombs of 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:44.670
 two 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:49.220
 already in the cemeteries a cemetery that 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:49.220
 a very nice national monument 

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:57.430
 and waiting to see if scared 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:59.440
 but they do not surround anything and do as well as here 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:02.050
 in the zone of the dawn to leave 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:04.400
 from the cemetery and I find myself with a 

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:08.220
 giant dog 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:11.680
 and with eyes as if they play flames 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:13.750
 but that really scared me and 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:15.970
 he immediately thought that he was the devil 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:19.260
 I was chasing and I ran 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:19.260
 and I'm going home 

00:04:42.979 --> 00:04:45.979
 two 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:52.020
 i 

00:04:58.409 --> 00:05:01.189
