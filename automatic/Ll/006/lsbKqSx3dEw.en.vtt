00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:35.920 
get to the castle we need to take this

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:37.770 
get to the castle we need to take this
cannon<00:00:36.309> down<00:00:36.489> but<00:00:36.760> just<00:00:36.879> dropping<00:00:37.269> one<00:00:37.420> Archer

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:37.780 
cannon down but just dropping one Archer

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:39.660 
cannon down but just dropping one Archer
there<00:00:37.930> is<00:00:38.049> enough<00:00:38.320> to<00:00:38.530> start<00:00:38.799> distracting

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:39.670 
there is enough to start distracting

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:41.219 
there is enough to start distracting
them<00:00:39.850> so<00:00:40.210> we<00:00:40.299> need<00:00:40.420> to<00:00:40.510> pull<00:00:40.720> these<00:00:40.870> into<00:00:41.140> the

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:41.229 
them so we need to pull these into the

00:00:41.229 --> 00:00:46.560 
them so we need to pull these into the
corner<00:00:44.940> probably<00:00:45.940> should<00:00:46.150> have<00:00:46.239> grabbed<00:00:46.479> that

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:46.570 
corner probably should have grabbed that

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:50.700 
corner probably should have grabbed that
fourth<00:00:46.960> one<00:00:47.199> in<00:00:47.409> the<00:00:47.500> north<00:00:47.710> as<00:00:47.920> well<00:00:49.440> so<00:00:50.440> do

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:50.710 
fourth one in the north as well so do

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:55.700 
fourth one in the north as well so do
that

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:06.920 

get<00:00:56.710> them<00:00:56.860> out<00:00:56.950> of<00:00:57.070> the<00:00:57.160> way<00:00:57.280> of<00:00:57.400> this<00:00:57.490> cannon

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.370 

arches<00:01:07.770> are<00:01:07.920> good<00:01:08.100> here<00:01:08.610> against<00:01:09.120> Ani<00:01:09.380> keep

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
arches are good here against Ani keep

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:11.840 
arches are good here against Ani keep
them<00:01:10.560> walking<00:01:10.770> around<00:01:11.040> because<00:01:11.520> they're<00:01:11.670> very

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
them walking around because they're very

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.730

make<00:01:28.080> sure<00:01:28.260> you<00:01:28.410> send<00:01:28.650> enough<00:01:28.890> arches<00:01:29.310> in

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
make sure you send enough arches in

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.460 
make sure you send enough arches in
there<00:01:29.640> to<00:01:30.240> kill<00:01:30.420> them<00:01:30.570> off<00:01:30.690> quickly<00:01:30.840> otherwise

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
there to kill them off quickly otherwise

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.830 
there to kill them off quickly otherwise
you'll<00:01:31.800> lose<00:01:32.040> more<00:01:33.000> arches<00:01:35.390> so<00:01:36.390> now<00:01:36.510> the<00:01:36.570> net

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
you'll lose more arches so now the net

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.540 
you'll lose more arches so now the net
next<00:01:37.140> obstacle<00:01:37.530> is<00:01:37.860> taking<00:01:38.250> down<00:01:38.400> these

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:38.550 
next obstacle is taking down these

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:42.950 
next obstacle is taking down these
archer<00:01:39.060> towers<00:01:39.510> and<00:01:39.690> cannon<00:01:41.450> dropping<00:01:42.450> a<00:01:42.600> ram

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
archer towers and cannon dropping a ram

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.020 
archer towers and cannon dropping a ram
to<00:01:42.990> help<00:01:43.320> me<00:01:43.410> get<00:01:43.590> into<00:01:43.860> the<00:01:43.980> into<00:01:44.310> that<00:01:44.460> Archer

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
to help me get into the into that Archer

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.300 
to help me get into the into that Archer
tower<00:01:45.530> Mongols<00:01:46.530> are<00:01:46.740> good<00:01:46.860> against<00:01:47.160> these

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
tower Mongols are good against these

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:55.190 
tower Mongols are good against these
archer<00:01:47.670> towers<00:01:53.450> that<00:01:54.450> Bonnie<00:01:54.720> troll<00:01:55.020> has

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
archer towers that Bonnie troll has

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.720 
archer towers that Bonnie troll has
stalled<00:01:55.560> me<00:01:55.710> so<00:01:55.980> I<00:01:56.010> should<00:01:56.250> have<00:01:56.310> pulled<00:01:56.580> that

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:56.730 
stalled me so I should have pulled that

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:05.010 
stalled me so I should have pulled that
out<00:01:56.940> earlier

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:05.020 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:07.139 

so<00:02:05.590> once<00:02:05.770> these<00:02:05.950> two<00:02:06.189> Oni<00:02:06.400> trials<00:02:06.820> are<00:02:06.909> gone

00:02:07.139 --> 00:02:07.149 
so once these two Oni trials are gone

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:09.960 
so once these two Oni trials are gone
and<00:02:07.390> that<00:02:07.570> Archer<00:02:07.960> tower<00:02:08.200> we<00:02:09.099> can<00:02:09.280> move<00:02:09.489> into

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 
and that Archer tower we can move into

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:30.839 
and that Archer tower we can move into
the<00:02:10.239> castle

00:02:30.839 --> 00:02:30.849 

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:33.300 

so<00:02:31.269> now<00:02:31.450> you<00:02:31.510> need<00:02:31.719> to<00:02:31.810> drop<00:02:31.989> arches<00:02:32.920> to<00:02:33.129> reach

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
so now you need to drop arches to reach

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:36.929 
so now you need to drop arches to reach
this<00:02:33.930> castle<00:02:34.930> make<00:02:35.920> sure<00:02:36.129> you<00:02:36.280> don't<00:02:36.400> drop<00:02:36.730> the

00:02:36.929 --> 00:02:36.939 
this castle make sure you don't drop the

00:02:36.939 --> 00:02:39.000 
this castle make sure you don't drop the
arches<00:02:37.389> too<00:02:37.599> far<00:02:37.870> south<00:02:38.170> because<00:02:38.620> they'll<00:02:38.799> run

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
arches too far south because they'll run

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:41.250 
arches too far south because they'll run
around<00:02:39.129> the<00:02:39.370> outside<00:02:39.599> and<00:02:40.599> I'll<00:02:40.719> show<00:02:40.930> you<00:02:40.959> why

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 
around the outside and I'll show you why

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:50.640 
around the outside and I'll show you why
that's<00:02:41.499> a<00:02:41.620> bad<00:02:41.829> reason<00:02:42.099> bad<00:02:42.760> thing<00:02:43.030> to<00:02:43.180> do<00:02:49.650> soon

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650 
that's a bad reason bad thing to do soon

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:52.110 
that's a bad reason bad thing to do soon
my<00:02:50.889> arches<00:02:51.430> are<00:02:51.609> going<00:02:51.760> to<00:02:51.849> get<00:02:51.969> the<00:02:52.060> attention

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.230 
brought the ninjas out which triggered

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:04.349 
brought the ninjas out which triggered
off<00:03:02.319> a<00:03:02.349> trap<00:03:02.739> and<00:03:03.040> blew<00:03:03.340> up<00:03:03.489> most<00:03:03.730> of<00:03:03.879> my<00:03:04.030> arches

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:14.780 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:17.300 

so<00:03:15.780> I<00:03:15.870> will<00:03:16.050> distract<00:03:16.470> the<00:03:16.650> cannon<00:03:17.010> and<00:03:17.159> ani

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
so I will distract the cannon and ani

so I will distract the cannon and ani
with<00:03:17.670> the<00:03:17.959> samurai<00:03:18.959> there<00:03:19.260> and<00:03:19.530> you<00:03:20.010> use<00:03:20.190> some

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
with the samurai there and you use some

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:54.930 
with the samurai there and you use some
more<00:03:20.489> archers<00:03:20.879> to<00:03:21.060> take<00:03:21.239> down<00:03:21.450> the<00:03:21.599> castle

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:54.940 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:57.900 

so<00:03:55.570> I<00:03:55.600> used<00:03:55.960> level<00:03:56.410> two<00:03:56.590> arches<00:03:57.100> level<00:03:57.760> two

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:57.910 
so I used level two arches level two
