you might recall from my review I was
very<00:01:57.759> disappointed<00:01:58.360> with<00:01:58.420> the<00:01:58.539> film<00:01:58.750> itself

00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.170 
very disappointed with the film itself

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:01.440 
very disappointed with the film itself
and<00:01:59.440> had<00:01:59.560> the<00:01:59.679> puzzle<00:02:00.130> pieces<00:02:00.369> but<00:02:01.090> it<00:02:01.179> never

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:01.450 
and had the puzzle pieces but it never

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:03.510 
and had the puzzle pieces but it never
put<00:02:01.690> the<00:02:01.780> puzzle<00:02:02.140> together<00:02:02.259> now<00:02:03.070> I<00:02:03.130> know<00:02:03.280> that

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:03.520 
put the puzzle together now I know that

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:05.760 
put the puzzle together now I know that
that's<00:02:03.580> a<00:02:03.789> difference<00:02:04.210> of<00:02:04.270> opinion<00:02:05.020> in<00:02:05.710> terms

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:05.770 
that's a difference of opinion in terms

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:07.590 
that's a difference of opinion in terms
of<00:02:06.070> what<00:02:06.130> you<00:02:06.340> want<00:02:06.580> not<00:02:06.880> only<00:02:06.910> out<00:02:07.240> of<00:02:07.270> just

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:07.600 
of what you want not only out of just

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.330 
of what you want not only out of just
films<00:02:08.019> in<00:02:08.170> general<00:02:08.560> but<00:02:08.920> I<00:02:08.979> think<00:02:09.220> more

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340 
films in general but I think more

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.729 
films in general but I think more
specifically<00:02:09.910> in<00:02:10.149> the<00:02:10.660> art<00:02:10.959> house<00:02:11.260> films

00:02:11.729 --> 00:02:11.739 
specifically in the art house films

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:13.620 
specifically in the art house films
right<00:02:11.980> I<00:02:12.190> think<00:02:12.519> a<00:02:12.580> lot<00:02:12.850> of<00:02:13.030> indie<00:02:13.300> art<00:02:13.450> house

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
right I think a lot of indie art house

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:15.600 
right I think a lot of indie art house
film<00:02:13.959> fans<00:02:14.290> don't<00:02:14.709> want<00:02:14.920> the<00:02:15.070> puzzle<00:02:15.400> would<00:02:15.489> be

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
film fans don't want the puzzle would be

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:16.860 
film fans don't want the puzzle would be
put<00:02:15.820> together<00:02:15.940> they<00:02:16.209> want<00:02:16.330> to<00:02:16.420> put<00:02:16.630> together

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
put together they want to put together

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:19.140 
put together they want to put together
themselves<00:02:17.310> but<00:02:18.310> I<00:02:18.340> think<00:02:18.610> no<00:02:18.700> matter<00:02:18.850> where

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
themselves but I think no matter where

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.420 
themselves but I think no matter where
you<00:02:19.360> stand<00:02:19.630> on<00:02:19.870> the<00:02:20.019> puzzle<00:02:20.380> issue<00:02:20.620> assembled

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
you stand on the puzzle issue assembled

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:23.940 
you stand on the puzzle issue assembled

or not assembled no one can dispute the

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:25.259 
or not assembled no one can dispute the
fact<00:02:24.220> that<00:02:24.310> Frank<00:02:24.580> really<00:02:24.790> didn't<00:02:25.150> make<00:02:25.209> much

00:02:25.259 --> 00:02:25.269 
fact that Frank really didn't make much

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:27.780 
fact that Frank really didn't make much

so<00:02:40.690> I<00:02:40.720> think<00:02:40.840> that<00:02:41.140> Lenny<00:02:41.290> Abramson<00:02:41.829> can't

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
so I think that Lenny Abramson can't

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.130 
so I think that Lenny Abramson can't
afford<00:02:42.250> to<00:02:42.549> have<00:02:42.670> another<00:02:42.910> Frank<00:02:43.570> if<00:02:43.810> he<00:02:43.900> wants

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
afford to have another Frank if he wants

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:45.900 
afford to have another Frank if he wants
his<00:02:44.200> career<00:02:44.620> to<00:02:44.769> continue<00:02:45.190> to<00:02:45.340> progress<00:02:45.519> so<00:02:45.880> I

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 
his career to continue to progress so I

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:48.270 
his career to continue to progress so I
hope<00:02:46.180> that<00:02:46.209> room<00:02:46.630> is<00:02:46.900> an<00:02:47.500> improvement<00:02:47.860> and<00:02:48.160> it

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
hope that room is an improvement and it

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:49.920 
hope that room is an improvement and it
has<00:02:48.400> a<00:02:48.430> different<00:02:48.850> screenwriter<00:02:49.360> it's

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
has a different screenwriter it's

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:51.300 
has a different screenwriter it's
written<00:02:50.230> by<00:02:50.410> the<00:02:50.440> woman<00:02:50.829> who<00:02:50.920> wrote<00:02:51.040> the<00:02:51.160> novel

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
written by the woman who wrote the novel

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:53.819 
written by the woman who wrote the novel
it's<00:02:51.579> based<00:02:51.850> on<00:02:52.090> Emma<00:02:52.510> Donoghue<00:02:52.930> so<00:02:53.590> maybe

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:53.829 
it's based on Emma Donoghue so maybe

00:02:53.829 --> 00:02:55.650 
it's based on Emma Donoghue so maybe
she's<00:02:54.100> a<00:02:54.130> little<00:02:54.340> bit<00:02:54.489> better<00:02:54.640> at<00:02:54.880> assembling

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:55.660 
she's a little bit better at assembling

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:57.870 
she's a little bit better at assembling
the<00:02:55.989> puzzle<00:02:56.170> pieces<00:02:56.560> but<00:02:57.370> what<00:02:57.489> I<00:02:57.549> really

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:57.880 
the puzzle pieces but what I really

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:58.979 
the puzzle pieces but what I really
there<00:02:58.090> are<00:02:58.150> two<00:02:58.269> things<00:02:58.450> I<00:02:58.600> really<00:02:58.630> like<00:02:58.959> about

00:02:58.979 --> 00:02:58.989 
there are two things I really like about

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:01.259 
there are two things I really like about
this<00:02:59.380> trailer<00:02:59.769> I<00:02:59.980> kind<00:03:00.250> of<00:03:00.310> like<00:03:00.519> got<00:03:01.000> more

00:03:01.259 --> 00:03:01.269 
this trailer I kind of like got more

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:03.750 
this trailer I kind of like got more
into<00:03:01.660> it<00:03:01.810> as<00:03:01.930> the<00:03:01.989> trailer<00:03:02.650> went<00:03:02.920> on<00:03:03.010> because

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
into it as the trailer went on because

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:04.979 
into it as the trailer went on because
of<00:03:03.970> the<00:03:04.090> way<00:03:04.209> I<00:03:04.239> think<00:03:04.510> the<00:03:04.570> trailer<00:03:04.840> was

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:04.989 
of the way I think the trailer was

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:07.620 
of the way I think the trailer was
expertly<00:03:05.560> cooked<00:03:05.829> together<00:03:06.040> so<00:03:06.880> at<00:03:07.180> first<00:03:07.359> I

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:07.630

that's totally different scenarios I

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:40.809 
that's totally different scenarios I
know<00:03:39.200> there<00:03:39.500> is<00:03:39.739> not<00:03:39.950> the<00:03:40.099> same<00:03:40.310> as<00:03:40.430> to<00:03:40.519> know<00:03:40.670> in

00:03:40.809 --> 00:03:40.819 
know there is not the same as to know in

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:43.330 
know there is not the same as to know in
Hollywood<00:03:40.969> also<00:03:41.810> she<00:03:41.989> was<00:03:42.349> said<00:03:42.620> no<00:03:42.829> to<00:03:42.890> for

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:43.340 
Hollywood also she was said no to for

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:44.800 
Hollywood also she was said no to for
the<00:03:43.400> role<00:03:43.519> of<00:03:43.549> Sarah<00:03:43.819> Connor<00:03:44.060> and<00:03:44.390> Terminator

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:44.810 
the role of Sarah Connor and Terminator

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:46.990 
the role of Sarah Connor and Terminator
Genisys<00:03:45.379> so<00:03:45.620> there<00:03:46.129> you<00:03:46.310> go<00:03:46.459> although<00:03:46.760> that

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:47.000 
Genisys so there you go although that

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.030 
Genisys so there you go although that
turned<00:03:47.180> out<00:03:47.269> to<00:03:47.299> be<00:03:47.390> very<00:03:47.959> serendipitous<00:03:48.590> no

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:49.040 
turned out to be very serendipitous no

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:51.520 
turned out to be very serendipitous no
but<00:03:49.819> anyway<00:03:50.090> it<00:03:50.450> kind<00:03:50.689> of<00:03:50.719> put<00:03:50.930> me<00:03:51.019> off<00:03:51.049> real

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:51.530 
but anyway it kind of put me off real

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:52.929 
but anyway it kind of put me off real
arsim<00:03:51.920> a<00:03:51.980> little<00:03:52.219> bit<00:03:52.370> but<00:03:52.549> I<00:03:52.609> think<00:03:52.640> she's

00:03:52.929 --> 00:03:52.939 
arsim a little bit but I think she's

00:03:52.939 --> 00:03:54.520 
arsim a little bit but I think she's
very<00:03:53.000> charismatic<00:03:53.840> as<00:03:53.959> an<00:03:54.079> actress<00:03:54.319> and<00:03:54.500> a

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:54.530 
very charismatic as an actress and a

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:55.240 
very charismatic as an actress and a
good<00:03:54.709> actress

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:55.250 
good actress

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:57.610 
good actress
so<00:03:55.370> I'm<00:03:55.790> not<00:03:55.939> totally<00:03:56.239> close<00:03:56.689> to<00:03:56.900> the<00:03:57.019> idea<00:03:57.319> of

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:57.620 
so I'm not totally close to the idea of

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:59.800 
so I'm not totally close to the idea of
coming<00:03:58.340> around<00:03:58.670> and<00:03:58.909> being<00:03:59.060> a<00:03:59.209> brie<00:03:59.389> Larson

00:03:59.800 --> 00:03:59.810 
coming around and being a brie Larson

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:02.860 
coming around and being a brie Larson

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:29.330 
are born in captivity so that is a

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:32.710 
are born in captivity so that is a
fascinating<00:04:29.900> thing<00:04:30.530> to<00:04:30.740> explore<00:04:31.310> in<00:04:32.210> a<00:04:32.360> movie

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:32.720 
fascinating thing to explore in a movie

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:34.450 
fascinating thing to explore in a movie
because<00:04:32.930> not<00:04:33.440> only<00:04:33.470> is<00:04:33.830> it<00:04:33.860> something<00:04:34.250> that

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:34.460 
because not only is it something that

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:36.219 
because not only is it something that
hasn't<00:04:34.610> been<00:04:34.789> explored<00:04:35.090> in<00:04:35.210> movies<00:04:35.570> it's<00:04:36.020> kind

00:04:36.219 --> 00:04:36.229 
hasn't been explored in movies it's kind

00:04:36.229 --> 00:04:38.379 
hasn't been explored in movies it's kind
of<00:04:36.289> like<00:04:36.410> well<00:04:37.250> I<00:04:37.400> guess<00:04:37.699> it's<00:04:37.880> you<00:04:38.180> know<00:04:38.270> the

00:04:38.379 --> 00:04:38.389 
of like well I guess it's you know the

00:04:38.389 --> 00:04:39.580 
of like well I guess it's you know the
media's<00:04:38.750> been<00:04:38.930> covering<00:04:39.169> it<00:04:39.259> more<00:04:39.410> than<00:04:39.500> they

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:39.590 
media's been covering it more than they

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:41.409 
media's been covering it more than they
have<00:04:39.710> in<00:04:39.949> the<00:04:40.009> past<00:04:40.220> but<00:04:40.490> it's<00:04:40.820> it's<00:04:41.120> new<00:04:41.300> to

00:04:41.409 --> 00:04:41.419 
have in the past but it's it's new to

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:43.089 
have in the past but it's it's new to
movies<00:04:41.750> and<00:04:41.960> it's<00:04:42.139> it's<00:04:42.470> an<00:04:42.590> actual<00:04:42.919> thing

00:04:43.089 --> 00:04:43.099 
movies and it's it's an actual thing

00:04:43.099 --> 00:04:44.890 
movies and it's it's an actual thing
that<00:04:43.250> happens<00:04:43.610> so<00:04:43.789> I<00:04:43.820> think<00:04:44.000> that's<00:04:44.300> a<00:04:44.510> great

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:44.900 
that happens so I think that's a great

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:46.930 
that happens so I think that's a great
direction<00:04:45.470> to<00:04:45.620> go<00:04:45.740> in<00:04:45.770> but<00:04:46.610> then<00:04:46.729> what<00:04:46.909> really

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:46.940 
direction to go in but then what really

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:48.939 
direction to go in but then what really
really<00:04:47.659> hooked<00:04:48.110> me<00:04:48.260> was<00:04:48.409> the<00:04:48.530> Alice<00:04:48.830> in

00:04:48.939 --> 00:04:48.949 
really hooked me was the Alice in

00:04:48.949 --> 00:04:51.089 
really hooked me was the Alice in
Wonderland<00:04:49.210> comparison<00:04:50.210> I<00:04:50.360> was<00:04:50.539> like<00:04:50.720> that's

00:04:51.089 --> 00:04:51.099 
Wonderland comparison I was like that's

00:04:51.099 --> 00:04:53.680 
Wonderland comparison I was like that's
fantastic<00:04:52.099> that's<00:04:52.159> brilliant<00:04:52.639> and<00:04:53.419> it<00:04:53.539> also

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:53.690 
fantastic that's brilliant and it also

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:55.659 
fantastic that's brilliant and it also
made<00:04:53.990> me<00:04:54.020> feel<00:04:54.349> that<00:04:54.740> I<00:04:54.770> wish<00:04:55.070> that<00:04:55.280> this<00:04:55.400> movie

00:04:55.659 --> 00:04:55.669 
made me feel that I wish that this movie

00:04:55.669 --> 00:04:57.969 
made me feel that I wish that this movie
had<00:04:56.000> a<00:04:56.030> little<00:04:56.479> bit<00:04:56.630> more<00:04:56.780> boldness<00:04:57.320> to<00:04:57.470> it<00:04:57.800> and

00:04:57.969 --> 00:04:57.979 
had a little bit more boldness to it and

00:04:57.979 --> 00:05:00.700 
had a little bit more boldness to it and
explored<00:04:58.849> the<00:04:59.000> Alice<00:04:59.300> in<00:04:59.419> Wonderland<00:04:59.710> analogy

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:00.710 
explored the Alice in Wonderland analogy

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:03.990 
explored the Alice in Wonderland analogy
a<00:05:00.949> little<00:05:01.250> bit<00:05:01.930> with<00:05:02.930> a<00:05:03.020> little<00:05:03.229> bit<00:05:03.320> more

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:04.000 
a little bit with a little bit more

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.850 
a little bit with a little bit more
strength<00:05:05.000> of<00:05:05.270> it<00:05:05.389> and<00:05:05.720> it's<00:05:05.840> fantasy<00:05:06.440> elements

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:06.860 
strength of it and it's fantasy elements

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:08.740 
strength of it and it's fantasy elements
you<00:05:07.039> don't<00:05:07.190> need<00:05:07.340> a<00:05:07.370> big<00:05:07.610> budget<00:05:07.820> or<00:05:08.210> a<00:05:08.509> big

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:08.750 
you don't need a big budget or a big

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:11.680 
you don't need a big budget or a big
visual<00:05:09.169> effects<00:05:09.530> team<00:05:09.830> to<00:05:10.280> do<00:05:10.460> a<00:05:10.490> fantasy<00:05:11.300> film

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:11.690 
visual effects team to do a fantasy film

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:13.779 
visual effects team to do a fantasy film
just<00:05:11.930> ask<00:05:12.080> Spike<00:05:12.470> Jonze<00:05:12.860> who's<00:05:13.190> made<00:05:13.400> plenty

00:05:13.779 --> 00:05:13.789 
just ask Spike Jonze who's made plenty

00:05:13.789 --> 00:05:15.999 
just ask Spike Jonze who's made plenty
of<00:05:13.990> fantasy<00:05:14.990> films<00:05:15.289> for<00:05:15.440> very<00:05:15.620> little<00:05:15.800> money

00:05:15.999 --> 00:05:16.009 
of fantasy films for very little money

00:05:16.009 --> 00:05:18.640 
of fantasy films for very little money
so<00:05:16.699> I<00:05:16.729> think<00:05:16.849> that<00:05:17.300> if<00:05:17.509> they<00:05:17.780> had<00:05:17.930> pushed<00:05:18.409> us

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:18.650 
so I think that if they had pushed us

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:20.290 
so I think that if they had pushed us
further<00:05:18.889> into<00:05:19.220> that<00:05:19.490> for<00:05:19.759> Alice<00:05:20.150> in

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:20.300 
further into that for Alice in

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:22.480 
further into that for Alice in
Wonderland<00:05:20.750> realm<00:05:21.139> I<00:05:21.380> think<00:05:22.009> this<00:05:22.220> movie

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:22.490 
Wonderland realm I think this movie

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:24.490 
Wonderland realm I think this movie
would<00:05:22.820> have<00:05:22.849> even<00:05:23.690> more<00:05:23.840> get<00:05:24.169> even<00:05:24.349> more

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:24.500 
would have even more get even more

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:27.430 
would have even more get even more
attention<00:05:24.830> from<00:05:25.490> the<00:05:25.610> press<00:05:26.449> from<00:05:27.050> critics

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:27.440 
attention from the press from critics

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:29.770 
attention from the press from critics
and<00:05:27.590> also<00:05:27.860> from<00:05:27.979> audiences<00:05:28.669> it<00:05:29.240> just<00:05:29.449> goes<00:05:29.599> to

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:29.780 
and also from audiences it just goes to

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:31.089 
and also from audiences it just goes to
show<00:05:29.840> you<00:05:29.990> at<00:05:30.110> the<00:05:30.199> home<00:05:30.380> the<00:05:30.590> Hollywood<00:05:31.009> is

00:05:31.089 --> 00:05:31.099 
show you at the home the Hollywood is

00:05:31.099 --> 00:05:32.950 
show you at the home the Hollywood is
the<00:05:31.220> game<00:05:31.400> and<00:05:31.699> you<00:05:32.060> really<00:05:32.090> have<00:05:32.509> to<00:05:32.659> come<00:05:32.840> you

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:32.960 
the game and you really have to come you

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:34.089 
the game and you really have to come you
know<00:05:33.110> it's<00:05:33.199> like<00:05:33.289> a<00:05:33.349> chess<00:05:33.560> game<00:05:33.800> and<00:05:34.009> you<00:05:34.070> have

00:05:34.089 --> 00:05:34.099 
know it's like a chess game and you have

00:05:34.099 --> 00:05:35.589 
know it's like a chess game and you have
to<00:05:34.220> really<00:05:34.639> think<00:05:34.729> of<00:05:34.970> all<00:05:35.150> the<00:05:35.270> different

00:05:35.589 --> 00:05:35.599 
to really think of all the different

00:05:35.599 --> 00:05:37.629 
to really think of all the different
moves<00:05:35.780> and<00:05:36.080> and<00:05:36.259> survive<00:05:36.830> and<00:05:37.159> you<00:05:37.340> know<00:05:37.430> move

00:05:37.629 --> 00:05:37.639 
moves and and survive and you know move

00:05:37.639 --> 00:05:39.399 
moves and and survive and you know move
forward<00:05:38.060> and<00:05:38.300> so<00:05:38.570> I<00:05:38.599> think<00:05:38.720> that's<00:05:38.990> a<00:05:39.169> missed

00:05:39.399 --> 00:05:39.409 
forward and so I think that's a missed

00:05:39.409 --> 00:05:41.170 
forward and so I think that's a missed
opportunity<00:05:40.130> for<00:05:40.159> this<00:05:40.460> movie<00:05:40.759> but<00:05:40.909> it<00:05:41.000> still

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:41.180 
opportunity for this movie but it still

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:43.149 
opportunity for this movie but it still
looks<00:05:41.270> very<00:05:41.750> good<00:05:42.050> and<00:05:42.349> I<00:05:42.710> think<00:05:42.949> that<00:05:43.070> even

00:05:43.149 --> 00:05:43.159
