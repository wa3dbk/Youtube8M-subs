00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 
them at the same time so overall it's a

really great experience now major

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:45.720 
really great experience now major
difference<00:02:44.440> between<00:02:44.620> these<00:02:44.890> two<00:02:45.069> is<00:02:45.280> also<00:02:45.489> of

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
difference between these two is also of

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.720 
difference between these two is also of
course<00:02:45.970> price<00:02:46.450> point<00:02:46.870> so<00:02:47.650> again<00:02:48.310> we<00:02:48.430> said<00:02:48.610> we

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
course price point so again we said we

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:50.460 
course price point so again we said we
would<00:02:48.850> compare<00:02:49.120> this<00:02:49.209> to<00:02:49.420> an<00:02:49.480> iPad<00:02:49.810> Mini<00:02:50.080> 2

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
would compare this to an iPad Mini 2

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:53.400 
would compare this to an iPad Mini 2
simply<00:02:51.370> because<00:02:51.730> for<00:02:52.569> the<00:02:52.660> price<00:02:52.780> point<00:02:53.200> this

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:53.410 
simply because for the price point this

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:56.880 
simply because for the price point this
is<00:02:53.620> going<00:02:53.860> to<00:02:53.920> be<00:02:54.010> more<00:02:54.489> similar<00:02:55.650> this<00:02:56.650> one

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890 
is going to be more similar this one

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:00.090 
is going to be more similar this one
