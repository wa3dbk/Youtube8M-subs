reason<00:01:53.859> I<00:01:54.100> can't<00:01:54.369> get<00:01:54.490> braces<00:01:54.670> now<00:01:55.060> is<00:01:55.359> because

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:55.630 
reason I can't get braces now is because

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:58.230 
reason I can't get braces now is because
I've<00:01:55.780> lost<00:01:55.990> about<00:01:56.289> 10<00:01:56.829> or<00:01:57.039> 11<00:01:57.069> teeth<00:01:57.609> so

lose<00:02:00.280> and<00:02:00.579> obviously<00:02:01.030> they're<00:02:01.149> not<00:02:01.270> going<00:02:01.420> to

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:01.479 
lose and obviously they're not going to

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:03.419 
lose and obviously they're not going to
put<00:02:01.600> braces<00:02:01.810> on<00:02:02.109> baby<00:02:02.319> teeth<00:02:02.679> so<00:02:02.890> I<00:02:03.039> have<00:02:03.310> to

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:44.610 
like X Factor season 3 I was like 12 and
it<00:02:42.549> was<00:02:42.640> a<00:02:42.730> really<00:02:43.090> cool<00:02:43.239> experience<00:02:43.349> but<00:02:44.349> I

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
it was a really cool experience but I

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:45.569 
it was a really cool experience but I
did<00:02:44.860> not<00:02:44.980> make<00:02:45.220> it

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:45.579 
did not make it

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:48.030 
did not make it
sadly<00:02:46.030> the<00:02:46.480> talent<00:02:46.870> there<00:02:47.019> was<00:02:47.170> like<00:02:47.349> crazy<00:02:47.650> I

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
sadly the talent there was like crazy I

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:49.589 
sadly the talent there was like crazy I
think<00:02:48.190> I've<00:02:48.340> improved<00:02:48.670> a<00:02:48.849> lot<00:02:49.000> since<00:02:49.060> then

00:02:49.589 --> 00:02:49.599 
think I've improved a lot since then

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:51.360 
think I've improved a lot since then
because<00:02:49.870> honestly<00:02:50.290> the<00:02:50.500> song<00:02:50.709> I<00:02:50.739> picked<00:02:51.160> for

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
because honestly the song I picked for

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:53.250 
because honestly the song I picked for
that<00:02:51.489> time<00:02:51.760> was<00:02:51.970> really<00:02:52.359> bad<00:02:52.600> I<00:02:52.630> probably

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
that time was really bad I probably

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:54.750 
that time was really bad I probably
should<00:02:53.650> have<00:02:53.680> picked<00:02:53.859> this<00:02:54.010> song<00:02:54.250> so<00:02:54.430> I<00:02:54.489> can<00:02:54.670> do
