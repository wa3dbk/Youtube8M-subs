00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.090 
that I find very useful so first of all
you<00:01:50.670> have<00:01:50.850> to<00:01:51.030> choose<00:01:51.750> the<00:01:51.780> language<00:01:52.680> your

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
you have to choose the language your

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.190 
you have to choose the language your
base<00:01:53.280> language<00:01:53.640> and<00:01:54.119> this<00:01:54.180> will<00:01:54.390> probably<00:01:54.899> be

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
base language and this will probably be

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.370 
base language and this will probably be
English<00:01:55.880> it<00:01:56.880> is<00:01:57.030> for<00:01:57.240> me<00:01:57.360> and<00:01:57.600> I'm<00:01:58.079> speaking

choose the languages that you want okay

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.490 
choose the languages that you want okay
when<00:02:32.970> you've<00:02:33.150> chosen<00:02:33.600> all<00:02:33.810> the<00:02:33.930> languages<00:02:34.410> you

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
when you've chosen all the languages you

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.470 
when you've chosen all the languages you
think<00:02:34.710> I'm<00:02:34.830> going<00:02:34.950> to<00:02:35.010> use<00:02:35.250> you<00:02:35.850> click<00:02:36.120> Next

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
think I'm going to use you click Next

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.900 
think I'm going to use you click Next
and<00:02:39.480> now<00:02:39.540> you<00:02:39.750> have<00:02:39.960> the<00:02:40.140> language<00:02:40.320> switching

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:40.910 
and now you have the language switching

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:44.630 
and now you have the language switching
options<00:02:41.910> and<00:02:42.740> you<00:02:43.740> can<00:02:43.770> do<00:02:44.190> this<00:02:44.370> with<00:02:44.610> a

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
options and you can do this with a

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.700 
options and you can do this with a
widget<00:02:44.910> actually<00:02:45.570> so<00:02:45.810> it<00:02:46.140> doesn't<00:02:46.590> really

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:46.710 
widget actually so it doesn't really

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:48.230 
widget actually so it doesn't really
matter<00:02:46.950> and<00:02:47.160> you<00:02:47.310> can<00:02:47.490> come<00:02:47.730> back<00:02:47.760> to<00:02:48.120> these

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:48.240 
matter and you can come back to these

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.960 
matter and you can come back to these
later<00:02:48.300> as<00:02:48.930> well<00:02:49.170> you<00:02:50.130> can<00:02:50.310> come<00:02:50.490> back<00:02:50.640> to<00:02:50.790> any

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
later as well you can come back to any

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:54.020 
later as well you can come back to any
of<00:02:51.060> these<00:02:51.180> steps<00:02:51.980> what<00:02:52.980> I<00:02:53.010> like<00:02:53.310> to<00:02:53.490> do<00:02:53.640> is

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
of these steps what I like to do is

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.810 
of these steps what I like to do is
include<00:02:54.780> the<00:02:55.380> flag<00:02:55.860> on<00:02:56.190> the<00:02:56.459> language

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:56.820 
include the flag on the language

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:00.260 
include the flag on the language
switcher<00:02:57.709> and<00:02:58.709> you<00:02:59.130> can<00:02:59.280> also<00:02:59.459> choose<00:02:59.910> whether

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:00.270 
switcher and you can also choose whether

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:02.120 
switcher and you can also choose whether
you<00:03:00.390> have<00:03:00.540> a<00:03:00.570> native<00:03:01.020> language<00:03:01.050> in<00:03:01.620> there<00:03:01.860> if

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
you have a native language in there if

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:04.520 
you have a native language in there if
you<00:03:02.250> could<00:03:02.430> click<00:03:02.790> that<00:03:02.820> off<00:03:03.209> and<00:03:03.540> you've<00:03:04.350> just

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
you could click that off and you've just

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:08.090 
you could click that off and you've just
got<00:03:04.709> the<00:03:04.830> language<00:03:05.010> in<00:03:05.660> one<00:03:06.660> language<00:03:07.650> if<00:03:08.040> you

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
got the language in one language if you

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.880 
got the language in one language if you
put<00:03:08.580> it<00:03:08.700> back<00:03:08.880> on<00:03:09.120> again<00:03:09.270> it<00:03:10.200> will<00:03:10.380> have<00:03:10.530> it<00:03:10.709> in

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
put it back on again it will have it in

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:14.630 
put it back on again it will have it in
the<00:03:11.010> native<00:03:11.400> language<00:03:11.820> as<00:03:12.000> well<00:03:13.280> so<00:03:14.280> you<00:03:14.340> can

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
the native language as well so you can

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.670 
the native language as well so you can
have<00:03:14.790> you<00:03:14.940> can<00:03:14.970> choose<00:03:15.360> which<00:03:15.600> of<00:03:15.900> these
