00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:04.009
 and interior design for me at the level of 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:06.020
 housing is the reflection of the 

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:08.360
 personality of a client in his 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:11.149
 more intimate spaces I think to grasp 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:16.759
 the style of each person you need 

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:19.549
 to translate it into your home I think that 

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:21.700
 when we leave, the 

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:25.490
 client with his wonderful space 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:28.640
 elegant functional but for him it does not stop 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:29.270
 we are culture, let's give it to me 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.159
 profession 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:34.220
 surely my mother has my mother 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:36.890
 very happy and always since she was little 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:39.289
 I have been reflecting in the rooms where 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:41.330
 we lived our personality of my 

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:43.159
 brothers mine that then I thought this 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:45.409
 what you have taught my mother you can 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:47.810
 take it to my profession I started 20 years ago 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:51.319
 years in 92 and I'm still learning 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:54.229
 logically on a hill my office 

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:56.000
 because I thought I had to exploit my 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:59.900
 creativity 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:02.210
 and he has learned a lot because the millimeter 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:03.980
 It exists in interior design always 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:05.660
 we make large houses medium houses 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:08.270
 but good to five centimeters ten 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:10.610
 centimeters nothing happens in fact a 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:16.070
 boat is like a house inside that 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:18.320
 there were five suites a living room also another 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:20.330
 interesting project is the theater of 

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:22.190
 castelldefels a public entity I 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:23.840
 contract yes that is a wonder at the level 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:25.730
 is we say of public recognition 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:28.310
 It's next to the train station and 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:34.209
 how can you understand a theater level 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:34.209
 of soundproofing has to be wonderful 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:40.740
 wonderful homes I've made since 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:42.750
 apartments of 35 meters in buildings a 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:44.400
 tourist level in buildings we said 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.530
 for rent in buildings for sale in 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.840
 those houses have to be very functional 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.430
 but that yes aesthetically they have to be 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.990
 spectacular this is the basis of 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.510
 interior design must first be functional 

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:59.250
 we cover needs we have all this and 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:03:01.320
 then it has to be a jewel of a house 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:03.360
 which for me is the biggest that I have 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:05.520
 fact that they are 1500 meters 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.470
 the client asked me that he wanted a house 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:09.630
 more Californian type spaces very 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:12.030
 open I baptized her to this house as 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:13.980
 a neoclassical because we have designed a 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:16.020
 Marvelous marble staircase with a 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.610
 banister forged all the part of 

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:19.500
 above that we have done as a kind 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:21.420
 of dome with a lamp all golden 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:24.540
 with gold leaf the white marbles of 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:26.760
 a sober but cool house and in front 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:30.770
 this is this house twenty thousand projects 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.770
 united in a project 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:37.670
 at home decor I like it is where I can 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:39.440
 practice where I can learn where 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:41.510
 I can try in my house I have done 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:43.760
 inventions and proven in a customer not me 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:45.020
 I think I've done 12 12 or 14 house 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:47.360
 things because besides always gone with 

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:50.360
 sponsor proposals as I have passed 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:52.970
 desdesde is a lounge was all glass 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:55.220
 It was a loft and glass kitchen bathrooms 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:57.440
 crystal when nobody used glass 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:04:00.370
 plate this 12 years ago I always go 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:00.370
 testing materials 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:06.750
 customers generally want a 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:08.730
 most relaxing house people want to 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:12.980
 when they are at home they feel very 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:12.980
 comfortable that everything is smoother
