00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:04.630
 with 

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:07.630
 versions 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:17.149
 in three years which we will talk to you 

00:00:17.149 --> 00:00:17.940
 about leaving 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.989
 leaflets to america 

00:00:19.989 --> 00:00:22.769
 At one time, still a Kara player 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.279
 decided to create in a microscope 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:27.179
 optical microscope 

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:28.929
 with which you will see life 

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:30.470
 bacteria 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:33.010
 then seeing what they really are 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:34.990
 and right from the first it seems that 

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:36.550
 helicopter 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:37.839
 last century 

00:00:37.839 --> 00:00:40.630
 he said Mikhalkov also do 

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:42.920
 microscope in the Cirque du Soleil 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:44.690
 see as reported 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:47.600
 actually microscope specificity 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:48.910
 committed 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:50.520
 when he began to observe life 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.980
 bacteria bacteria fungi and so on 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:56.130
 he drew attention to a very interesting 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:58.120
 thing 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:59.670
 but it's flowers 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:00.840
 0102 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.270
 these facts and begins to glow 

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:05.270
 and then he did 

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:07.340
 guess what paint color 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.220
 coach of Kazan frequencies 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:12.690
 before that I have these studies 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:14.579
 for each microorganism 

00:01:14.579 --> 00:01:16.679
 found a large number of these 

00:01:16.679 --> 00:01:18.170
 resonant feelings 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:20.250
 the next idea that came to him in 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:21.740
 the head was perfect 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:22.960
 brilliant 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.540
 remember here still in school 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:27.870
 cups goal rings 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:29.770
 in the service area the same frequency 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:30.940
 what's happening 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:33.110
 Someone did a glass of tanks 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:34.540
 the assumption is that if you are by this 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:36.770
 microorganisms bring 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:37.900
 same resonance 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:40.340
 frequencies in intensity more 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.250
 than they radiate themselves 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:44.020
 then they must die 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:45.440
 and so he began to carry out the first 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:46.660
 research and found out that yes 

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:48.870
 really america 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:50.910
 and here pursuing them pursue 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:52.120
 he's good 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:53.620
 what is ecology 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:55.600
 this virus causes 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.540
 stated at the end of the 19th century to whom and 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:01:59.690
 guidance 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:01.420
 interaction with different 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.549
 other departments provoke this or that 

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:05.220
 other oncology 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:06.980
 he conducted these experiments and 

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:08.949
 found out that yes indeed it is 

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:10.990
 confirmation of his theory 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:13.429
 he invited very serious scientists 

00:02:13.429 --> 00:02:15.189
 these scientists have fixed that 

00:02:15.189 --> 00:02:16.229
 Group 

00:02:16.229 --> 00:02:19.059
 patients with stage four oncology 

00:02:19.059 --> 00:02:20.909
 really power 

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:23.309
 after that he spent treatment for 90 

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:24.189
 days 

00:02:24.189 --> 00:02:25.570
 by their methods 

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:27.469
 this group of people 

00:02:27.469 --> 00:02:30.359
 and the same group of scientists 

00:02:30.359 --> 00:02:33.259
 fixed that yes indeed 

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:35.419
 there was a complete recovery 

00:02:35.419 --> 00:02:37.839
 complete recovery of people from the fourth 

00:02:37.839 --> 00:02:41.019
 stage of oncology more and more in 90 days 

00:02:42.419 --> 00:02:44.669
 and that's when 

00:02:44.669 --> 00:02:47.130
 took another step which in my opinion 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:48.450
 is n 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.749
 but actually wrong 

00:02:50.749 --> 00:02:52.939
 he published a big book end 

00:02:52.939 --> 00:02:55.079
 symbolism 

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:56.889
 leaving the offices 

00:02:56.889 --> 00:02:59.729
 said it tastes good personality 

00:02:59.729 --> 00:03:02.009
 ex-wife 

00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:04.849
 priority remain with 

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:06.299
 in pharmaceutical lists 

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:06.990
 of the company 

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:08.359
 didn't like it 

00:03:08.359 --> 00:03:10.019
 and they began to exercise on it 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:12.219
 hitting but smashing the lab 

00:03:12.219 --> 00:03:13.939
 he destroyed microscopes 

00:03:13.939 --> 00:03:17.229
 but still he kept his thoughts 

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:19.519
 he is in the old year 

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:22.149
 after his death another scientist 

00:03:22.149 --> 00:03:23.179
 gathering 

00:03:23.179 --> 00:03:25.719
 remnants of these materials for 15 years 

00:03:25.719 --> 00:03:27.269
 could repeat 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:29.749
 all his experience and published article 

00:03:29.749 --> 00:03:32.569
 what really works 

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:34.569
 but after the publication of this article and in 

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:36.480
 America in Canada was formed 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.200
 community of friends a to iphone 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.599
 who use his methods 

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:42.969
 and continue his work work there 

00:03:42.969 --> 00:03:44.409
 quite successfully 

00:03:44.409 --> 00:03:46.339
 present time they create their 

00:03:46.339 --> 00:03:47.599
 installation working 

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:49.050
 optical range 

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:50.789
 next class 

00:03:50.789 --> 00:03:53.789
 in 2005, mmb managed to find 

00:03:54.499 --> 00:03:57.149
 these paradise friends' tail 

00:03:57.149 --> 00:03:59.120
 and getting materials from there 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:01.349
 moment veil developing new 

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:02.730
 device that could 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:05.829
 work with viruses bacteria fungi 

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:07.979
 this development has continued the challenge 

00:04:07.979 --> 00:04:09.839
 2100 half a year 

00:04:09.839 --> 00:04:12.209
 here are two thousand and eighth year that is 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:14.699
 six years went development we were 

00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:16.389
 quite complicated but nonetheless she 

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:18.069
 ended successfully 

00:04:18.069 --> 00:04:19.949
 last spring we began to conduct 

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:21.840
 clinical trials 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:23.009
 these devices 

00:04:23.009 --> 00:04:24.539
 surprisingly it turned out that yes 

00:04:24.539 --> 00:04:26.529
 don't really work they work 

00:04:26.529 --> 00:04:27.949
 effectively 

00:04:27.949 --> 00:04:30.099
 therefore it is acknowledgment any 

00:04:30.099 --> 00:04:31.879
 economic methods 

00:04:31.879 --> 00:04:33.899
 and after we got the first 

00:04:33.899 --> 00:04:34.840
 results 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:37.449
 we started working already in more detail in 

00:04:37.449 --> 00:04:39.710
 in this direction they joined us on 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:43.029
 currently 38 clinics 

00:04:43.029 --> 00:04:45.639
 but who that hurt is the care of personnel 

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:47.239
 which are really 

00:04:47.239 --> 00:04:48.580
 unique method 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:50.930
 unparalleled in height so far 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:51.719
 only 

00:04:51.719 --> 00:04:52.629
 what we have 

00:04:52.629 --> 00:04:54.009
 really proved yes 

00:04:54.009 --> 00:04:55.429
 really electromagnetic 

00:04:55.429 --> 00:04:57.039
 fluctuations being a departure was 

00:04:57.039 --> 00:04:58.860
 optical range or 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:00.539
 in the electromagnetic range 

00:05:00.539 --> 00:05:01.900
 radiation and so on 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:04.290
 can really cope with the square 

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:06.169
 severe diseases such 

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:08.860
 like racquets with such as hepatitis 

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:10.860
 with such serious problems as 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:12.039
 oncology 

00:05:12.039 --> 00:05:15.249
 no one has ever done it 

00:05:15.249 --> 00:05:17.219
 there was a unique development 

00:05:17.219 --> 00:05:18.960
 which in my opinion 

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:22.120
 and their rights to life especially 

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:24.729
 present time 

00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:26.469
 in a project of hope which was originally 

00:05:26.469 --> 00:05:27.919
 assigned to 

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:30.199
 drugs on 

00:05:30.199 --> 00:05:31.960
 pharmaceutical industry they 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:34.009
 now did not materialize to be zero 

00:05:34.009 --> 00:05:37.460
 insufficiently justified 

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:38.569
 in response to 

00:05:38.569 --> 00:05:40.039
 certain antibiotics 

00:05:40.039 --> 00:05:41.509
 new strains appear 

00:05:41.509 --> 00:05:43.430
 microorganisms 

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:45.580
 and it is resistant to these things 

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:48.279
 the same goes for tuberculosis 

00:05:48.279 --> 00:05:49.900
 few mistakes no one 

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:51.800
 medication 

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:53.580
 tuberculosis goes into powerful medicine 

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:55.729
 steady form when already 

00:05:55.729 --> 00:05:57.910
 no drug works 

00:05:57.910 --> 00:06:00.130
 these are sentenced people also from 

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:01.349
 oncology 

00:06:01.349 --> 00:06:03.479
 this is also sentenced people 

00:06:03.479 --> 00:06:05.349
 and that's just this method developed 

00:06:05.349 --> 00:06:07.060
 kind of Bataysk 

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:09.490
 can cope with tuberculosis 

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:11.580
 listen to drug resistant forms 

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:12.610
 and cope with herpes 

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:15.880
 infections cope with hepatitis so that 

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:16.880
 with what now 

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:19.880
 conventional methods of pages absolutely 

00:06:20.539 --> 00:06:23.479
 I still think that these positions do not mean 

00:06:23.479 --> 00:06:26.919
 still believes that there are thousand not notified 

00:06:26.919 --> 00:06:29.169
 but with these clinical methods 

00:06:29.169 --> 00:06:31.379
 oil rebate tests they go away 

00:06:31.379 --> 00:06:32.669
 condition 

00:06:32.669 --> 00:06:34.270
 say goodbye to all these problems 

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:36.400
 can cope so this 

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:39.539
 unique it should be 

00:06:39.539 --> 00:06:40.510
 introduced 

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:43.510
 and he should become the property 

00:06:44.029 --> 00:06:45.849
 therefore not only developed 

00:06:45.849 --> 00:06:48.169
 sending over education is not 

00:06:48.169 --> 00:06:50.089
 air conditioning is very good 

00:06:50.089 --> 00:06:52.080
 complement each other 

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:54.699
 that is, one method to destroy those who 

00:06:54.699 --> 00:06:56.040
 prevents us from living 

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:58.710
 and by another method we restore oh 

00:06:58.710 --> 00:06:59.259
 how to be 

00:06:59.259 --> 00:07:01.419
 to the state in which they are 

00:07:01.419 --> 00:07:03.369
 originally genetically must 

00:07:03.369 --> 00:07:04.409
 be 

00:07:04.409 --> 00:07:06.999
 Ie two methods 

00:07:06.999 --> 00:07:08.869
 complement each other 

00:07:08.869 --> 00:07:10.899
 they are given the opportunity to man 

00:07:10.899 --> 00:07:12.619
 restore health 

00:07:12.619 --> 00:07:15.199
 even as a result of those serious problems 

00:07:15.199 --> 00:07:16.259
 which the 

00:07:16.259 --> 00:07:18.240
 still considered him 

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:19.050
 incurable
