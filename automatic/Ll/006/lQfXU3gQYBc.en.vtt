on an unknown clock and I can see that

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.010 
on an unknown clock and I can see that
because<00:00:37.850> if<00:00:38.060> I<00:00:38.180> look<00:00:38.360> down<00:00:38.570> here<00:00:38.810> in<00:00:38.930> the

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:41.330 
bottom left a left hand corner I'll see

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:43.090 
bottom left a left hand corner I'll see
a<00:00:41.360> little<00:00:41.570> till<00:00:41.870> to<00:00:42.050> sign<00:00:42.260> and<00:00:42.530> will<00:00:42.680> say<00:00:42.860> on

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:43.100 
a little till to sign and will say on

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:48.030 
a little till to sign and will say on
own<00:00:43.930> so<00:00:44.930> like<00:00:45.140> if<00:00:45.350> I<00:00:45.500> walk<00:00:45.740> onto<00:00:46.730> an<00:00:47.120> own<00:00:47.300> block

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:48.040 
own so like if I walk onto an own block

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.410 
own so like if I walk onto an own block
in<00:00:49.040> the<00:00:49.190> bottom<00:00:49.430> left<00:00:49.610> hand<00:00:49.700> corner<00:00:49.820> you<00:00:50.150> see

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:50.420 
in the bottom left hand corner you see

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.020 
in the bottom left hand corner you see
the<00:00:50.690> tilde<00:00:51.080> druidic<00:00:51.500> wanderer<00:00:51.920> and<00:00:52.700> if<00:00:52.940> a

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:53.030 
the tilde druidic wanderer and if a

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:56.020 
the tilde druidic wanderer and if a
little<00:00:53.240> practice<00:00:53.720> is<00:00:53.900> tilde<00:00:54.260> unknown<00:00:54.680> so<00:00:55.550> um

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:56.030 
little practice is tilde unknown so um

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:58.420 
little practice is tilde unknown so um
an<00:00:56.330> easy<00:00:56.600> way<00:00:56.810> to<00:00:56.840> do<00:00:57.050> it<00:00:57.200> is<00:00:57.410> to<00:00:57.440> stand<00:00:58.160> on<00:00:58.310> the

00:00:58.420 --> 00:00:58.430 
an easy way to do it is to stand on the

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:01.270 
an easy way to do it is to stand on the
plot<00:00:58.670> that<00:00:58.880> you're<00:00:59.150> trying<00:00:59.480> to<00:00:59.630> mark<00:00:59.930> and<00:01:00.280> do

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:01.280 
plot that you're trying to mark and do

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:07.800 
plot that you're trying to mark and do
you<00:01:01.430> plot<00:01:01.930> for<00:01:02.930> sale<00:01:03.610> and<00:01:04.960> then<00:01:05.960> plot<00:01:06.759> don't

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:07.810 
you plot for sale and then plot don't

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:12.190 
you plot for sale and then plot don't
claim<00:01:09.820> and<00:01:10.820> so<00:01:11.030> now<00:01:11.179> this<00:01:11.240> plots<00:01:11.600> in<00:01:11.780> my<00:01:11.990> name

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:12.200 
claim and so now this plots in my name

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.649 
claim and so now this plots in my name
and<00:01:12.409> every<00:01:12.710> time<00:01:12.920> I<00:01:13.280> walk<00:01:13.820> back<00:01:14.090> on<00:01:14.299> to<00:01:14.539> it

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:14.659 
and every time I walk back on to it

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:16.929 
and every time I walk back on to it
you'll<00:01:14.869> see<00:01:15.020> Lord<00:01:15.289> Mac<00:01:15.530> big<00:01:15.740> I<00:01:15.890> excuse<00:01:16.250> so

you'll see Lord Mac big I excuse so

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:19.690 
you'll see Lord Mac big I excuse so
there<00:01:17.359> it<00:01:17.450> is<00:01:17.539> so<00:01:18.289> you<00:01:19.009> really<00:01:19.159> have<00:01:19.310> to<00:01:19.460> kind

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:19.700 
there it is so you really have to kind

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.249 
there it is so you really have to kind
of<00:01:19.729> walk<00:01:19.909> back<00:01:20.179> and<00:01:20.210> forth<00:01:20.450> and<00:01:20.929> figure<00:01:21.229> out

00:01:21.249 --> 00:01:21.259 
of walk back and forth and figure out

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:24.789 
of walk back and forth and figure out
where<00:01:21.619> is<00:01:21.890> the<00:01:22.329> border<00:01:23.329> the<00:01:23.749> farthest<00:01:24.350> corner

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:24.799 
where is the border the farthest corner

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:26.560 
where is the border the farthest corner
of<00:01:24.829> the<00:01:24.979> spot<00:01:25.280> where<00:01:25.670> if<00:01:25.789> I<00:01:25.909> move<00:01:26.119> one<00:01:26.329> block

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:26.570 
of the spot where if I move one block

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:28.440 
of the spot where if I move one block
forward<00:01:27.049> it's<00:01:27.200> going<00:01:27.350> to<00:01:27.439> change<00:01:27.469> names<00:01:28.039> and

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:28.450 
forward it's going to change names and

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:30.940 
forward it's going to change names and
and<00:01:29.450> really<00:01:29.689> that's<00:01:29.929> the<00:01:30.140> best<00:01:30.350> way<00:01:30.530> I<00:01:30.560> figured

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:30.950 
and really that's the best way I figured

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:32.590 
and really that's the best way I figured
out<00:01:31.069> how<00:01:31.159> to<00:01:31.249> do<00:01:31.429> it<00:01:31.460> so<00:01:31.759> like<00:01:31.999> right<00:01:32.179> here<00:01:32.479> it

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:32.600 
out how to do it so like right here it

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.929 
out how to do it so like right here it
goes<00:01:32.780> to<00:01:32.929> Drew<00:01:33.140> attic<00:01:33.439> and<00:01:34.009> if<00:01:34.130> i<00:01:34.219> go<00:01:34.340> back<00:01:34.520> goes

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:34.939 
goes to Drew attic and if i go back goes

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:37.029 
goes to Drew attic and if i go back goes
the<00:01:35.119> board<00:01:35.359> so<00:01:35.630> i<00:01:35.659> know<00:01:35.810> that<00:01:35.990> this<00:01:36.140> square

00:01:37.029 --> 00:01:37.039 
the board so i know that this square

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:39.910 
the board so i know that this square
right<00:01:37.219> here<00:01:37.280> is<00:01:37.670> the<00:01:37.700> corner<00:01:38.509> of<00:01:38.539> this<00:01:38.780> plot<00:01:39.109> so

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
right here is the corner of this plot so

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.249 
right here is the corner of this plot so
one<00:01:40.069> mark<00:01:40.280> that<00:01:40.490> with<00:01:40.640> green<00:01:40.909> and<00:01:41.299> then<00:01:42.020> I

00:01:42.249 --> 00:01:42.259 
one mark that with green and then I

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:45.160 
one mark that with green and then I
basically<00:01:42.560> can<00:01:43.100> follow<00:01:43.399> that<00:01:43.670> to<00:01:44.659> the<00:01:44.689> outer

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:45.170 
basically can follow that to the outer

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:49.599 
basically can follow that to the outer
edge<00:01:45.350> and<00:01:46.009> go<00:01:46.909> this<00:01:47.119> way<00:01:47.359> and<00:01:48.069> once<00:01:49.069> I<00:01:49.189> walk<00:01:49.399> out

00:01:49.599 --> 00:01:49.609 
edge and go this way and once I walk out

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:51.099 
edge and go this way and once I walk out
of<00:01:49.639> my<00:01:49.729> zone<00:01:50.060> it'll<00:01:50.420> change<00:01:50.630> some<00:01:50.869> board

00:01:51.099 --> 00:01:51.109 
of my zone it'll change some board

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:55.090 
of my zone it'll change some board
mcmack<00:01:51.560> the<00:01:51.740> guys<00:01:51.920> use<00:01:52.310> to<00:01:53.079> unknown<00:01:54.079> so<00:01:54.799> I<00:01:54.829> go

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:55.100 
mcmack the guys use to unknown so I go

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.149 
mcmack the guys use to unknown so I go
back<00:01:55.249> here<00:01:55.520> and<00:01:55.670> I<00:01:56.270> mark<00:01:56.479> that<00:01:56.689> spot<00:01:56.869> and<00:01:57.229> I'm

00:01:58.149 --> 00:01:58.159 
back here and I mark that spot and I'm

00:01:58.159 --> 00:01:59.859 
back here and I mark that spot and I'm
going<00:01:58.280> to<00:01:58.310> do<00:01:58.429> the<00:01:58.520> same<00:01:58.700> thing<00:01:59.030> walking<00:01:59.749> this

00:01:59.859 --> 00:01:59.869 
going to do the same thing walking this

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:02.590 
going to do the same thing walking this
way<00:01:59.929> I<00:02:00.399> have<00:02:01.399> to<00:02:01.520> be<00:02:01.700> on<00:02:01.819> the<00:02:01.909> server<00:02:02.149> right<00:02:02.420> now

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:02.600 
way I have to be on the server right now

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.010 
way I have to be on the server right now
that<00:02:02.959> is<00:02:03.520> 18<00:02:04.520> x<00:02:04.670> 18<00:02:04.700> plots<00:02:05.359> so<00:02:05.689> i<00:02:05.749> think<00:02:05.869> that

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.020 
that is 18 x 18 plots so i think that

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:07.890 
that is 18 x 18 plots so i think that
changes<00:02:06.649> my<00:02:06.799> server

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:07.900 
changes my server

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:11.160 
changes my server

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
how you mark the borders of a plot

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:51.300 
how you mark the borders of a plot
before<00:02:50.050> you<00:02:50.320> build<00:02:50.500> it<00:02:50.650> up<00:02:50.709> to<00:02:50.890> sell<00:02:51.100> to<00:02:51.280> a

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:53.990 
before you build it up to sell to a
resident<00:02:51.820> and<00:02:52.030> then<00:02:52.510> i'll<00:02:52.660> just<00:02:52.690> do<00:02:52.990> plot<00:02:53.470> on<00:02:53.890> a

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
resident and then i'll just do plot on a

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:01.230 
resident and then i'll just do plot on a
claim<00:02:55.000> and<00:02:55.860> plot<00:02:56.860> not<00:02:57.700> for<00:02:58.270> sale<00:02:58.650> and<00:03:00.090> now<00:03:01.090> it

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:01.240 
claim and plot not for sale and now it

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:03.180 
claim and plot not for sale and now it
should<00:03:01.510> be<00:03:01.630> back<00:03:01.870> to<00:03:01.900> unknown<00:03:02.410> so<00:03:02.830> it<00:03:03.010> should

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.190 
should be back to unknown so it should

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:06.690 
should be back to unknown so it should
go<00:03:03.220> from<00:03:03.610> juridical<00:03:04.650> and<00:03:05.650> plots<00:03:06.340> marked

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
go from juridical and plots marked

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.900 
go from juridical and plots marked
