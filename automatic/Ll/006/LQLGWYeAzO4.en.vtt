actually<00:00:36.780> a<00:00:36.809> map<00:00:36.930> from<00:00:37.020> the<00:00:37.110> first<00:00:37.290> game<00:00:37.379> game

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:38.220

actually a map from the first game game
applied<00:00:38.489> before<00:00:38.670> this<00:00:39.000> was<00:00:39.270> on<00:00:39.390> one<00:00:40.199> of<00:00:40.230> the

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
applied before this was on one of the

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.140 
applied before this was on one of the
original<00:00:40.710> games<00:00:40.860> most<00:00:41.100> but<00:00:41.280> this<00:00:41.520> map<00:00:41.910> you<00:00:42.059> can

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:42.150 
original games most but this map you can

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:45.320 
original games most but this map you can
see<00:00:42.210> now<00:00:42.510> is<00:00:42.750> one<00:00:43.590> of<00:00:43.830> the<00:00:43.980> maps<00:00:44.160> in<00:00:44.400> the<00:00:44.489> fire

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
you can see and when I first played this

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.810 
you can see and when I first played this
I<00:00:52.170> wasn't<00:00:52.800> expecting<00:00:52.920> much<00:00:53.280> because<00:00:53.370> I<00:00:53.580> i

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
I wasn't expecting much because I i

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.399 
I wasn't expecting much because I i
enjoyed<00:00:54.360> homefront<00:00:54.809> when<00:00:54.960> I<00:00:55.019> first<00:00:55.170> had<00:00:55.320> it

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:55.409 
enjoyed homefront when I first had it

00:00:55.409 --> 00:00:58.219 
enjoyed homefront when I first had it
but<00:00:55.650> you<00:00:56.339> know<00:00:56.400> what<00:00:56.909> kind<00:00:57.690> of<00:00:57.720> a<00:00:57.809> board<00:00:58.019> had

00:00:58.219 --> 00:00:58.229 
but you know what kind of a board had

00:00:58.229 --> 00:01:00.020 
but you know what kind of a board had
done<00:00:58.320> a<00:00:58.350> wire<00:00:58.559> won't<00:00:59.190> apply<00:00:59.370> this<00:00:59.460> I'll<00:00:59.760> really

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
done a wire won't apply this I'll really

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.240 
done a wire won't apply this I'll really
love<00:01:00.269> this<00:01:00.420> map<00:01:00.659> I've<00:01:00.930> got<00:01:01.229> to<00:01:01.350> say<00:01:01.470> if<00:01:02.070> you've

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
love this map I've got to say if you've

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.890 
love this map I've got to say if you've
got<00:01:02.489> home<00:01:02.729> front<00:01:03.000> and<00:01:03.239> you're<00:01:03.479> thinking<00:01:03.809> of

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:03.900 
got home front and you're thinking of

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:04.910 
got home front and you're thinking of
picking<00:01:04.019> up<00:01:04.260> the<00:01:04.350> map<00:01:04.500> pack<00:01:04.650> for<00:01:04.830> it

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
picking up the map pack for it

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.260 
picking up the map pack for it
definitely<00:01:05.400> do<00:01:05.519> it<00:01:05.549> because<00:01:05.729> this<00:01:05.909> map<00:01:06.120> is

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
definitely do it because this map is

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.630 
definitely do it because this map is
really<00:01:07.049> beautifully<00:01:07.470> designed<00:01:07.650> really<00:01:08.340> well

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
really beautifully designed really well

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.539 
really beautifully designed really well
designed<00:01:08.880> to<00:01:09.330> it<00:01:09.479> was<00:01:09.600> so<00:01:09.750> much<00:01:09.870> fun<00:01:09.930> to<00:01:10.110> play

00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:10.549 
designed to it was so much fun to play

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:12.649 
designed to it was so much fun to play
it's<00:01:11.549> not<00:01:11.729> enough<00:01:11.909> for<00:01:11.940> me<00:01:12.090> to<00:01:12.180> buy<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:12.360> game

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
it's not enough for me to buy the game

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.359 
it's not enough for me to buy the game
again<00:01:12.930> but<00:01:13.110> if<00:01:13.200> i<00:01:13.290> had<00:01:13.320> it<00:01:13.619> i<00:01:13.740> probably<00:01:14.010> would

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
again but if i had it i probably would

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.340 
again but if i had it i probably would
buy<00:01:14.549> them<00:01:14.760> up<00:01:14.850> back<00:01:15.030> because<00:01:15.210> i<00:01:15.450> think<00:01:15.810> it's

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
buy them up back because i think it's

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.370 
buy them up back because i think it's
only<00:01:16.409> 240<00:01:17.220> microsoft<00:01:17.640> points<00:01:18.000> so<00:01:18.450> you<00:01:19.230> know

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
only 240 microsoft points so you know

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:20.420 
only 240 microsoft points so you know
it's<00:01:19.470> pretty<00:01:19.680> much<00:01:19.770> worth<00:01:19.950> I<00:01:20.070> think<00:01:20.100> you<00:01:20.310> get

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
it's pretty much worth I think you get

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.310 
it's pretty much worth I think you get
two<00:01:20.610> maps<00:01:20.880> and<00:01:21.240> they<00:01:21.600> were<00:01:21.660> also<00:01:21.780> testing

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
two maps and they were also testing

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.320 
two maps and they were also testing
their<00:01:22.470> new<00:01:22.650> network<00:01:23.250> infrastructure<00:01:23.730> I<00:01:23.970> think

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
their new network infrastructure I think

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.750 
their new network infrastructure I think
I<00:01:24.570> think<00:01:25.290> that's<00:01:25.440> where<00:01:25.530> I<00:01:25.590> read<00:01:25.830> and<00:01:26.010> there

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:26.760 
I think that's where I read and there

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:29.000 
I think that's where I read and there
was<00:01:26.880> a<00:01:26.910> news<00:01:27.180> article<00:01:27.360> about<00:01:27.990> it<00:01:28.050> I<00:01:28.500> believe<00:01:28.770> on

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:29.010 
was a news article about it I believe on

pack so if you do have home front and I

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.440 
pack so if you do have home front and I
don't<00:01:53.250> know<00:01:53.340> if<00:01:53.490> the<00:01:53.580> map<00:01:53.700> packs<00:01:53.880> out<00:01:54.030> or<00:01:54.330> not

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
don't know if the map packs out or not

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:55.940 
don't know if the map packs out or not
so<00:01:55.080> if<00:01:55.140> you<00:01:55.200> don't<00:01:55.350> have<00:01:55.440> the<00:01:55.500> map<00:01:55.620> pack<00:01:55.800> this

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
so if you don't have the map pack this

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.110 
so if you don't have the map pack this
is<00:01:56.100> a<00:01:56.130> good<00:01:56.310> way<00:01:56.400> to<00:01:56.460> check<00:01:56.580> out<00:01:56.850> one<00:01:56.880> of<00:01:57.000> the

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:57.120 
is a good way to check out one of the

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:58.340 
is a good way to check out one of the
maps<00:01:57.240> and<00:01:57.450> if<00:01:57.600> you<00:01:57.659> don't<00:01:57.840> have<00:01:57.960> home<00:01:58.110> front

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
maps and if you don't have home front

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.160 
maps and if you don't have home front
and<00:01:58.670> this<00:01:59.670> is<00:01:59.790> a<00:01:59.820> good<00:02:00.000> way<00:02:00.150> to<00:02:00.210> play<00:02:00.900> the<00:02:01.020> demo

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
and this is a good way to play the demo

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:02.660 
and this is a good way to play the demo
again<00:02:01.409> and<00:02:01.770> try<00:02:02.100> out<00:02:02.190> the<00:02:02.280> map<00:02:02.400> pack<00:02:02.550> that

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
again and try out the map pack that

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.370 
again and try out the map pack that
comes<00:02:02.790> with<00:02:03.000> it<00:02:03.030> so<00:02:03.330> I<00:02:03.600> believe<00:02:04.140> they<00:02:04.230> don't

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
comes with it so I believe they don't

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:05.630 
comes with it so I believe they don't
appoint<00:02:04.620> a<00:02:04.710> good<00:02:04.860> job<00:02:05.040> at<00:02:05.190> releasing<00:02:05.460> this

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
appoint a good job at releasing this

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.180 
appoint a good job at releasing this
