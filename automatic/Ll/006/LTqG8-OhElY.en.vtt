current season growth and we're going to

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:34.120 
current season growth and we're going to
take<00:00:32.870> a<00:00:32.900> bud<00:00:33.170> that's<00:00:33.350> right<00:00:33.560> down<00:00:33.770> here<00:00:33.920> at<00:00:34.040> the

base of this sleeve and we're going to

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:38.440 
base of this sleeve and we're going to
put<00:00:35.870> it<00:00:35.989> into<00:00:36.380> the<00:00:36.890> root<00:00:37.100> stock<00:00:37.390> normally<00:00:38.390> if

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:38.450 
put it into the root stock normally if

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:40.510 
put it into the root stock normally if
we<00:00:38.540> left<00:00:38.780> that<00:00:38.900> bud<00:00:39.110> there<00:00:39.350> it<00:00:39.920> would<00:00:40.130> just<00:00:40.340> go

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:40.520 
we left that bud there it would just go

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.160 
we left that bud there it would just go
into<00:00:40.670> another<00:00:40.910> branch<00:00:41.210> instead<00:00:41.720> though<00:00:41.899> when

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:42.170 
into another branch instead though when

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:43.870 
into another branch instead though when
we<00:00:42.200> take<00:00:42.530> it<00:00:42.739> we're<00:00:43.160> going<00:00:43.310> to<00:00:43.370> take<00:00:43.579> it<00:00:43.730> and

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:43.880 
we take it we're going to take it and

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:46.120 
we take it we're going to take it and
put<00:00:44.030> it<00:00:44.210> into<00:00:44.420> a<00:00:44.450> new<00:00:44.690> tree<00:00:44.930> so<00:00:45.710> let's<00:00:45.740> start

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:46.130 
put it into a new tree so let's start

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:49.510 
put it into a new tree so let's start
with<00:00:46.310> cutting<00:00:46.550> off<00:00:46.730> the<00:00:46.880> bud<00:00:47.030> stick<00:00:48.340> first<00:00:49.340> of

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:49.520 
with cutting off the bud stick first of

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.190 
with cutting off the bud stick first of
all<00:00:49.670> we<00:00:49.820> cut<00:00:50.000> off<00:00:50.120> the<00:00:50.300> first<00:00:50.510> year's<00:00:50.780> current

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:51.200 
all we cut off the first year's current

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.110 
all we cut off the first year's current
season<00:00:51.530> growth<00:00:51.740> will<00:00:52.310> then<00:00:52.460> come<00:00:52.700> back<00:00:52.730> in

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:53.120 
season growth will then come back in

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.270 
season growth will then come back in
here<00:00:53.330> and<00:00:53.450> snip<00:00:54.080> off<00:00:54.230> the<00:00:54.290> Leafs<00:00:54.680> leaving<00:00:55.250> a

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:55.280 
here and snip off the Leafs leaving a

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.750 
here and snip off the Leafs leaving a
little<00:00:55.610> bit<00:00:55.790> of<00:00:55.940> the<00:00:56.810> petiole<00:00:57.590> or<00:00:58.160> leaf<00:00:58.430> stock

00:00:58.750 --> 00:00:58.760 
little bit of the petiole or leaf stock

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:03.970 
little bit of the petiole or leaf stock
still<00:00:59.480> on<00:00:59.780> the<00:01:00.500> bud<00:01:00.680> stick<00:01:02.230> just<00:01:03.230> trim<00:01:03.770> it<00:01:03.830> off

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:03.980 
still on the bud stick just trim it off

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:08.350 
still on the bud stick just trim it off
up<00:01:04.280> to<00:01:04.610> about<00:01:05.239> 3/4<00:01:05.990> of<00:01:06.020> the<00:01:06.170> way<00:01:06.320> and<00:01:07.360> then

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:08.360 
up to about 3/4 of the way and then

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:09.520 
up to about 3/4 of the way and then
we'll<00:01:08.479> cut<00:01:08.630> it<00:01:08.750> off<00:01:08.840> because<00:01:08.990> we<00:01:09.229> don't<00:01:09.380> want

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:09.530 
we'll cut it off because we don't want

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:11.380 
we'll cut it off because we don't want
these<00:01:09.650> larger<00:01:10.070> Bugsy's<00:01:10.430> older<00:01:10.790> newer<00:01:11.150> buds

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:11.390 
these larger Bugsy's older newer buds

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:13.330 
these larger Bugsy's older newer buds
because<00:01:11.689> you're<00:01:11.840> not<00:01:12.470> just<00:01:12.650> vegetatively

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:13.340 
because you're not just vegetatively

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:15.550 
because you're not just vegetatively
good<00:01:13.640> and<00:01:13.970> so<00:01:14.600> there<00:01:14.780> we<00:01:14.900> have<00:01:15.049> our<00:01:15.079> bud<00:01:15.380> sick

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:15.560 
good and so there we have our bud sick

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.380 
good and so there we have our bud sick
we'll<00:01:15.710> prim<00:01:16.010> off<00:01:16.130> the<00:01:16.250> bottom<00:01:16.520> as<00:01:16.640> well<00:01:16.670> and<00:01:17.300> we

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:17.390 
we'll prim off the bottom as well and we

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:18.790 
we'll prim off the bottom as well and we
have<00:01:17.510> our<00:01:17.630> bud<00:01:17.810> stick<00:01:18.080> we'll<00:01:18.290> use<00:01:18.500> now<00:01:18.770> to

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:18.800 
have our bud stick we'll use now to

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:20.910 
have our bud stick we'll use now to
transfer<00:01:19.280> the<00:01:19.370> buds<00:01:19.550> into<00:01:19.760> the<00:01:19.940> root<00:01:20.060> stock

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:20.920 
transfer the buds into the root stock

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.320 
transfer the buds into the root stock
now<00:01:21.920> we<00:01:21.980> have<00:01:22.220> our<00:01:22.340> bud<00:01:22.520> stick<00:01:22.790> let's<00:01:23.000> see<00:01:23.180> how

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:23.330 
now we have our bud stick let's see how

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:25.540 
now we have our bud stick let's see how
we<00:01:23.390> get<00:01:23.600> the<00:01:23.720> bud<00:01:23.870> off<00:01:24.140> of<00:01:24.350> it<00:01:24.500> we'll<00:01:25.159> take<00:01:25.370> our

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:25.550 
we get the bud off of it we'll take our

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:28.390 
we get the bud off of it we'll take our
knife<00:01:25.730> down<00:01:26.090> below<00:01:26.510> the<00:01:27.050> bud<00:01:27.290> and<00:01:27.530> gradually

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:28.400 
knife down below the bud and gradually

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.690 
knife down below the bud and gradually
draw<00:01:28.729> it<00:01:28.850> up<00:01:29.030> above<00:01:29.780> the<00:01:30.560> bud<00:01:30.770> leaving<00:01:31.640> a

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 
draw it up above the bud leaving a

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.640 
draw it up above the bud leaving a
little<00:01:31.850> sliver<00:01:32.180> we<00:01:32.659> then<00:01:32.840> come<00:01:33.080> across<00:01:33.380> the

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:33.650 
little sliver we then come across the

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:38.640 
little sliver we then come across the
top<00:01:33.830> and<00:01:34.670> make<00:01:35.479> a<00:01:35.510> cut<00:01:36.909> remove<00:01:37.909> the<00:01:38.180> bud<00:01:38.360> and

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:38.650 
top and make a cut remove the bud and

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:41.560 
top and make a cut remove the bud and
there<00:01:39.650> it<00:01:39.770> is<00:01:39.950> our<00:01:40.280> bud<00:01:40.580> is<00:01:40.850> down<00:01:41.180> in<00:01:41.390> there

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:41.570 
there it is our bud is down in there

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:43.719 
there it is our bud is down in there
between<00:01:41.720> the<00:01:41.990> petiole<00:01:42.350> and<00:01:42.590> the<00:01:43.340> bark<00:01:43.549> and

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:43.729 
between the petiole and the bark and

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:46.300 
between the petiole and the bark and
this<00:01:44.000> is<00:01:44.120> what<00:01:44.270> we'll<00:01:44.420> insert<00:01:45.190> now<00:01:46.190> we're

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.310 
this is what we'll insert now we're

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:47.680 
this is what we'll insert now we're
going<00:01:46.400> to<00:01:46.460> learn<00:01:46.580> why<00:01:46.820> this<00:01:46.880> is<00:01:47.270> called<00:01:47.420> tea

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:47.690 
going to learn why this is called tea

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:49.270 
going to learn why this is called tea
budding<00:01:48.049> because<00:01:48.229> we're<00:01:48.380> going<00:01:48.500> to<00:01:48.560> take<00:01:48.740> this

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:49.280 
budding because we're going to take this

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:50.920 
budding because we're going to take this
bud<00:01:49.580> that<00:01:49.760> we<00:01:49.850> cut<00:01:50.060> previously<00:01:50.570> from<00:01:50.659> the<00:01:50.780> bud

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:50.930 
bud that we cut previously from the bud

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:52.990 
bud that we cut previously from the bud
stick<00:01:51.170> we're<00:01:51.650> going<00:01:51.770> to<00:01:51.830> make<00:01:51.920> a<00:01:51.950> tea<00:01:52.220> cut<00:01:52.490> into

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000 
stick we're going to make a tea cut into

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.820 
stick we're going to make a tea cut into
the<00:01:53.120> root<00:01:53.780> stock<00:01:54.049> and<00:01:54.320> then<00:01:54.560> we're<00:01:54.650> going<00:01:54.740> to

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:54.830 
the root stock and then we're going to

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:56.469 
the root stock and then we're going to
insert<00:01:55.159> the<00:01:55.369> bud<00:01:55.580> so<00:01:55.940> let's<00:01:56.090> see<00:01:56.210> how<00:01:56.330> it's

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:56.479 
insert the bud so let's see how it's

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:58.539 
insert the bud so let's see how it's
done<00:01:56.659> first<00:01:57.200> of<00:01:57.350> all<00:01:57.470> I<00:01:57.500> make<00:01:57.710> my<00:01:57.890> vertical<00:01:58.220> cut

00:01:58.539 --> 00:01:58.549 
done first of all I make my vertical cut

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:01.480 
done first of all I make my vertical cut
downward<00:01:59.200> then<00:02:00.200> I<00:02:00.320> come<00:02:00.500> across<00:02:00.799> and<00:02:01.130> I<00:02:01.159> finish

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.490 
downward then I come across and I finish

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:05.200 
downward then I come across and I finish
the<00:02:01.670> tea<00:02:01.880> like<00:02:02.299> that<00:02:02.540> I<00:02:02.840> then<00:02:03.619> come<00:02:03.890> in<00:02:04.210> peel

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.210 
the tea like that I then come in peel

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:09.669 
the tea like that I then come in peel
that<00:02:05.420> bark<00:02:05.690> back<00:02:05.930> a<00:02:05.960> little<00:02:06.229> bit<00:02:08.439> this<00:02:09.439> is<00:02:09.560> what

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:09.679 
that bark back a little bit this is what

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:11.080 
that bark back a little bit this is what
we<00:02:09.769> call<00:02:09.920> when<00:02:10.069> they<00:02:10.189> say<00:02:10.369> when<00:02:10.580> the<00:02:10.640> BOC<00:02:10.789> peels

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
we call when they say when the BOC peels

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.869 
we call when they say when the BOC peels
back<00:02:11.269> we<00:02:11.450> say<00:02:11.569> the<00:02:11.689> bark<00:02:11.900> is<00:02:12.049> slipping<00:02:12.700> we<00:02:13.700> made

00:02:13.869 --> 00:02:13.879 
back we say the bark is slipping we made

00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:15.399 
back we say the bark is slipping we made
our<00:02:14.000> tea<00:02:14.180> cut<00:02:14.420> and<00:02:14.599> we<00:02:14.659> can<00:02:14.720> see<00:02:14.930> that<00:02:15.110> the<00:02:15.200> bark

00:02:15.399 --> 00:02:15.409 
our tea cut and we can see that the bark

00:02:15.409 --> 00:02:17.350 
our tea cut and we can see that the bark
is<00:02:15.560> slipping<00:02:15.920> that<00:02:16.010> means<00:02:16.220> it's<00:02:16.400> able<00:02:17.060> to<00:02:17.239> be

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
is slipping that means it's able to be

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.360 
is slipping that means it's able to be
pulled<00:02:17.569> back<00:02:17.810> very<00:02:18.170> easily<00:02:18.439> and<00:02:18.830> what<00:02:19.250> we'll

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
pulled back very easily and what we'll

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.880 
pulled back very easily and what we'll
do<00:02:19.489> is<00:02:19.580> we'll<00:02:19.700> just<00:02:19.880> insert<00:02:20.390> our<00:02:20.630> bud<00:02:20.900> down

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
do is we'll just insert our bud down

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:24.970 
do is we'll just insert our bud down
into<00:02:22.370> that<00:02:22.840> there<00:02:23.840> we<00:02:24.050> have<00:02:24.230> it<00:02:24.380> it's<00:02:24.530> all<00:02:24.709> set

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
into that there we have it it's all set

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:25.540 
into that there we have it it's all set
in<00:02:25.010> ready<00:02:25.340> to

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:25.550 
in ready to

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:27.610 
in ready to
so<00:02:25.640> what<00:02:26.300> we<00:02:26.390> do<00:02:26.540> then<00:02:26.720> is<00:02:27.050> we'll<00:02:27.200> come<00:02:27.260> back

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
so what we do then is we'll come back

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.320 
so what we do then is we'll come back
and<00:02:28.190> we'll<00:02:28.520> run<00:02:28.760> off<00:02:28.910> a<00:02:28.940> bit<00:02:29.270> of<00:02:29.800> plastic<00:02:30.800> tape

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 
and we'll run off a bit of plastic tape

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:35.350 
and we'll run off a bit of plastic tape
and<00:02:32.680> we'll<00:02:33.680> wrap<00:02:33.860> this<00:02:34.130> button<00:02:34.610> make<00:02:34.880> sure<00:02:34.910> it

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
and we'll wrap this button make sure it

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.750 
and we'll wrap this button make sure it
stays<00:02:35.960> in<00:02:35.990> tight<00:02:36.410> and<00:02:36.920> we'll<00:02:37.040> wrap<00:02:37.160> above<00:02:37.520> and

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
stays in tight and we'll wrap above and

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.590 
stays in tight and we'll wrap above and
below<00:02:38.030> the<00:02:38.060> bud<00:02:38.420> but<00:02:39.230> not<00:02:39.410> covering<00:02:39.740> it<00:02:40.480> so<00:02:41.480> we

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:41.600 
below the bud but not covering it so we

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:48.070 
below the bud but not covering it so we
stick<00:02:41.870> that<00:02:42.020> in<00:02:44.950> tight<00:02:46.600> come<00:02:47.600> back<00:02:47.780> and<00:02:47.960> loop

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:48.080 
stick that in tight come back and loop

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:51.640 
stick that in tight come back and loop
it<00:02:48.230> against<00:02:48.590> itself<00:02:49.010> and<00:02:50.260> we're<00:02:51.260> done<00:02:51.440> and

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
it against itself and we're done and

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:54.010 
it against itself and we're done and
that<00:02:51.980> bud<00:02:52.190> then<00:02:52.400> will<00:02:52.820> stay<00:02:53.030> there<00:02:53.270> and<00:02:53.480> next

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:54.020 
that bud then will stay there and next

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:55.270 
that bud then will stay there and next
spring<00:02:54.230> we'll<00:02:54.440> come<00:02:54.590> back<00:02:54.770> and<00:02:54.980> we'll<00:02:55.070> cut<00:02:55.250> off

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
spring we'll come back and we'll cut off

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.130 
spring we'll come back and we'll cut off
just<00:02:55.640> above<00:02:55.910> that<00:02:56.150> and<00:02:56.360> that<00:02:56.660> bud<00:02:56.840> will<00:02:56.990> then

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:57.140 
just above that and that bud will then

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:00.160 
just above that and that bud will then
grow<00:02:57.380> and<00:02:57.620> we'll<00:02:57.740> have<00:02:57.860> a<00:02:57.890> new<00:02:58.070> tree<00:02:59.080> here<00:03:00.080> are

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.170 
grow and we'll have a new tree here are

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:01.750 
grow and we'll have a new tree here are
some<00:03:00.320> trees<00:03:00.530> that<00:03:00.560> we<00:03:00.770> T<00:03:00.920> buttered<00:03:01.220> last<00:03:01.460> year

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 
some trees that we T buttered last year

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:03.970 
some trees that we T buttered last year
this<00:03:02.180> spring<00:03:02.540> we<00:03:02.690> cut<00:03:02.900> them<00:03:03.020> off<00:03:03.170> and<00:03:03.470> then<00:03:03.860> we

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:03.980 
this spring we cut them off and then we

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:05.650 
this spring we cut them off and then we
forced<00:03:04.310> our<00:03:04.460> single<00:03:04.820> bud<00:03:04.970> to<00:03:05.120> grow<00:03:05.300> into<00:03:05.630> a

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:05.660 
forced our single bud to grow into a

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:08.530 
forced our single bud to grow into a
single<00:03:06.050> stem<00:03:06.370> next<00:03:07.370> year<00:03:07.610> these<00:03:08.120> trees<00:03:08.390> will

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:08.540 
single stem next year these trees will

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:13.510 
single stem next year these trees will
be<00:03:08.630> ready<00:03:08.810> for<00:03:08.960> planting<00:03:11.890> these<00:03:12.890> trees<00:03:12.950> start

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:13.520 
be ready for planting these trees start

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:15.490 
be ready for planting these trees start
out<00:03:13.670> just<00:03:13.910> like<00:03:14.060> those<00:03:14.210> ones<00:03:14.450> we<00:03:14.600> T<00:03:14.780> but<00:03:14.990> it<00:03:15.110> but

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:15.500 
out just like those ones we T but it but

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:17.740 
out just like those ones we T but it but
it<00:03:15.620> does<00:03:15.830> take<00:03:16.130> patience<00:03:16.820> it'll<00:03:17.480> be<00:03:17.600> about

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750 
it does take patience it'll be about

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:19.330 
it does take patience it'll be about
three<00:03:18.050> years<00:03:18.260> before<00:03:18.680> you<00:03:18.830> get<00:03:18.980> your<00:03:19.160> first
