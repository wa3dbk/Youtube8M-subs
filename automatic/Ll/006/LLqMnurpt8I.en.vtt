this situation what's gonna happen with

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:53.020 
this situation what's gonna happen with
Lesnar<00:02:50.960> is<00:02:51.260> he<00:02:51.530> even<00:02:51.770> going<00:02:51.920> to<00:02:51.980> stay<00:02:52.220> with<00:02:52.250> WWE

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
Lesnar is he even going to stay with WWE

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:55.690 
Lesnar is he even going to stay with WWE
after<00:02:53.450> his<00:02:53.540> contracts<00:02:54.110> up<00:02:54.230> this<00:02:54.890> isn't

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
after his contracts up this isn't

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.300 
after his contracts up this isn't
looking<00:02:56.060> like<00:02:56.090> a<00:02:56.240> good<00:02:56.390> sign<00:02:56.920> I'd<00:02:57.920> like<00:02:58.280> to

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310 
looking like a good sign I'd like to

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:00.460 
looking like a good sign I'd like to
think<00:02:58.670> that<00:02:58.760> Lesnar<00:02:59.330> respects<00:02:59.930> the<00:03:00.050> business

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:00.470 
think that Lesnar respects the business

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:03.160 
think that Lesnar respects the business
enough<00:03:00.830> that<00:03:01.100> he<00:03:01.340> is<00:03:01.460> going<00:03:01.700> to<00:03:02.060> finish<00:03:02.840> out

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170 
enough that he is going to finish out

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:05.680 
enough that he is going to finish out
his<00:03:03.320> contract<00:03:03.590> he's<00:03:04.580> gonna<00:03:04.850> you<00:03:05.210> know<00:03:05.330> have

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:05.690 
his contract he's gonna you know have

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:08.050 
his contract he's gonna you know have
his<00:03:05.900> match<00:03:06.140> with<00:03:06.170> Roman<00:03:06.770> reigns<00:03:06.820> most<00:03:07.820> likely

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.060 
his match with Roman reigns most likely

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:10.690 
his match with Roman reigns most likely
end<00:03:08.330> up<00:03:08.450> dropping<00:03:08.690> the<00:03:08.960> title<00:03:09.440> I<00:03:10.190> mean<00:03:10.550> that

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 
end up dropping the title I mean that

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:12.640 
end up dropping the title I mean that
was<00:03:10.790> expected<00:03:11.330> anyway<00:03:11.630> but<00:03:11.870> this<00:03:12.050> is<00:03:12.290> kind<00:03:12.560> of

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.650 
was expected anyway but this is kind of

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:15.760 
was expected anyway but this is kind of
further<00:03:12.980> solidifying<00:03:13.880> that<00:03:14.350> so<00:03:15.350> we'll<00:03:15.560> have

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:15.770 
further solidifying that so we'll have

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:17.980 
further solidifying that so we'll have
to<00:03:15.950> see<00:03:16.130> what<00:03:16.280> happens<00:03:16.480> right<00:03:17.480> now<00:03:17.690> it's<00:03:17.930> not

to see what happens right now it's not

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:20.320 
to see what happens right now it's not
looking<00:03:18.140> too<00:03:18.590> good<00:03:18.970> especially<00:03:19.970> with<00:03:20.030> Lesnar

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:20.330 
looking too good especially with Lesnar

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:23.440 
looking too good especially with Lesnar
