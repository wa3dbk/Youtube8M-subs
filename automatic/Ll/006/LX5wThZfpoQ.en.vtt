00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:06.569
 hi friends from youtube i'm heads moon 

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:09.080
 712 here with your records good in 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:12.570
 this time I bring you an application 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:16.250
 to be able to download and install their 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:20.070
 applications for ipod ipad and iphone 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:22.590
 totally free are not good payment 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.500
 first let's go to the description that 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:28.040
 I will leave you 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:31.820
 and they will have a strange file like this 

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:34.850
 decompress it and stay here if not 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:37.340
 you know how to unzip we click 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:39.410
 right and extract here 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:42.710
 to decompress what you have to have 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:45.440
 the unit program and once this is done 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:48.410
 we open the file enormously double 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:51.590
 click we give in yes 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:54.500
 and mayor masters in this button here 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:57.050
 to accept 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:59.460
 this goes like this 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:03.410
 why 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.410
 the program is in Japanese 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:11.030
 once this is done we give it here and 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:14.290
 finish we go to the folder where he has 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.290
 stayed saved 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:21.930
 and we created a shortcut 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:24.350
 I do this because normally I do not 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.420
 load well in the application 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:29.180
 once done this are these two 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:31.830
 let's open this 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:35.150
 which is the one that we have created 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:35.150
 we give him a yes 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.280
 late 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:48.510
 We are waiting for him to fully load the 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.210
 application as we see has already loaded the 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:53.630
 application 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:56.940
 Once this is done we can look for a 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:59.960
 application any 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:05.570
 I do not know what 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:07.880
 we want to install antonio here I have some 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:11.200
 and let's try with minecraft I'm going to 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:15.560
 remove and then download 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:16.750
 the program is nothing in Japanese and that 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.820
 it makes it a bit difficult to manage 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:21.680
 then yes we are going to look for something we give 

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:25.540
 click on this bar and write the 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.540
 name of the program or game 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:29.750
 let's ask 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.340
 or not 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:47.810
 Here we will see the options 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:51.800
 we close this here and we look for what is the 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:54.610
 most current version normally because if 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.610
 we look for another 

00:02:55.490 --> 00:03:02.050
 do not open to us and we are closed 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:02.050
 program automatically 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:05.650
 it did not appear 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:14.349
 it should not be this the button we open 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:21.659
 and we give him in this to camp in this 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:25.410
 here there and we fight and start 

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:29.610
 download to use the video 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:33.150
 while download good friends once 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:34.830
 have downloaded the game or application 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:40.220
 that you want 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:40.220
 connect the ipod or iphone 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:47.769
 to the computer by means of the cable 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:51.310
 Once done, those that appear in 

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:54.050
 this in the letters in gray like here are 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:56.690
 those that are already installed 

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:59.390
 if we are going to install some others just 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:02.830
 we give it to the button here and we wait 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:02.830
 to this reaches 100% 

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:16.910
 it's a bit delayed after 95% 

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:19.350
 it's always like this and families this has 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:23.400
 been everything 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:25.229
 can look on your iphone or ipad or what 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:30.070
 that have 

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:32.810
 and they will see that if it remains and automatically 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:34.910
 to the left to play 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:37.780
 good friends this has been all for today 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:40.330
 I wanted to give you this 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:42.400
 small program that does not serve much 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:46.060
 I through this program 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:49.750
 downloaded games like infinity blade 

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:51.260
 most wanted and limbo that are very games 

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:53.840
 good ones 

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:57.020

00:04:53.840 --> 00:05:00.590
