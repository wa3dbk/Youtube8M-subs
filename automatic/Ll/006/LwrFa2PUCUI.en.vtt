00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:17.660 
puzzles with familiar objects helps
develop<00:00:16.560> hand-eye<00:00:16.920> coordination<00:00:17.190> and

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
develop hand-eye coordination and

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.790 
develop hand-eye coordination and
increased<00:00:18.060> matching<00:00:18.510> and<00:00:18.800> early

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
increased matching and early

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.220 
increased matching and early
problem-solving<00:00:20.730> skills<00:00:21.210> so<00:00:21.420> let's<00:00:21.600> close

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
problem-solving skills so let's close

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.530 
problem-solving skills so let's close
this<00:00:22.470> down<00:00:22.740> now<00:00:23.010> look<00:00:23.310> you<00:00:24.210> have<00:00:24.330> three

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:24.540 
this down now look you have three

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:26.540 
this down now look you have three
choices<00:00:24.690> to<00:00:24.990> work<00:00:25.200> on<00:00:25.440> colors<00:00:25.800> patterns<00:00:26.250> and

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
choices to work on colors patterns and

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.020 
choices to work on colors patterns and
forms<00:00:27.120> and<00:00:28.100> let's<00:00:29.100> go<00:00:29.190> and<00:00:29.340> start<00:00:29.550> with<00:00:29.670> colors

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:30.030 
forms and let's go and start with colors

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:31.760 
forms and let's go and start with colors
now<00:00:30.630> the<00:00:30.690> nice<00:00:30.900> thing<00:00:31.080> about<00:00:31.140> this<00:00:31.380> app<00:00:31.560> is

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:31.770 
now the nice thing about this app is

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:34.280 
now the nice thing about this app is
every<00:00:31.980> time<00:00:32.160> we<00:00:32.219> start<00:00:32.759> the<00:00:33.450> colors<00:00:33.750> will<00:00:34.020> or

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
every time we start the colors will or

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.319 
every time we start the colors will or
whichever<00:00:34.559> exercise<00:00:35.129> you're<00:00:35.280> working<00:00:35.550> on<00:00:35.700> the

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
whichever exercise you're working on the

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.959 
whichever exercise you're working on the
pictures<00:00:36.690> are<00:00:36.839> not<00:00:37.109> always<00:00:37.410> the<00:00:37.829> same<00:00:37.910> okay<00:00:38.910> so

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
pictures are not always the same okay so

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.479 
pictures are not always the same okay so
they<00:00:39.269> do<00:00:39.329> change<00:00:39.929> so<00:00:40.769> what<00:00:41.160> we're<00:00:41.280> looking<00:00:41.309> for

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
they do change so what we're looking for

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.610 
they do change so what we're looking for
is<00:00:41.760> match<00:00:41.969> the<00:00:41.999> tiles<00:00:42.839> with<00:00:43.019> the<00:00:43.109> colors<00:00:43.440> so

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
is match the tiles with the colors so

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.520 
is match the tiles with the colors so
for<00:00:43.649> example<00:00:44.190> you<00:00:44.429> can<00:00:44.609> see<00:00:44.760> this<00:00:44.909> is<00:00:45.149> you<00:00:45.329> know

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:45.530 
for example you can see this is you know

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:49.220 
for example you can see this is you know
light<00:00:46.530> blue<00:00:46.879> orange<00:00:47.879> and<00:00:48.690> I'm<00:00:48.749> just<00:00:48.899> gonna<00:00:48.989> run

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
light blue orange and I'm just gonna run

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.239 
light blue orange and I'm just gonna run
through<00:00:49.260> this<00:00:49.530> quickly<00:00:49.769> because<00:00:49.980> it's

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:50.249 
through this quickly because it's

00:00:50.249 --> 00:01:10.190 
through this quickly because it's
obvious<00:01:07.340> okay<00:01:08.340> you<00:01:09.060> get<00:01:09.240> three<00:01:09.509> stars<00:01:09.719> if<00:01:10.079> you

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
obvious okay you get three stars if you

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.539 
obvious okay you get three stars if you
get<00:01:10.350> a<00:01:10.380> little<00:01:10.469> bit<00:01:10.680> wrong<00:01:10.860> you<00:01:10.979> get<00:01:11.100> lesser

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
get a little bit wrong you get lesser

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.280 
get a little bit wrong you get lesser
stars<00:01:11.759> but<00:01:12.180> you<00:01:12.390> can<00:01:12.509> play<00:01:12.719> again<00:01:12.990> or<00:01:13.020> you<00:01:13.170> can

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
stars but you can play again or you can

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.310 
stars but you can play again or you can
go<00:01:13.380> back<00:01:13.530> to<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:13.860> home<00:01:14.850> screen<00:01:15.229> now<00:01:16.229> I<00:01:16.259> just

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
go back to the home screen now I just

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.690 
go back to the home screen now I just
want<00:01:16.590> to<00:01:16.649> show<00:01:16.770> you<00:01:16.829> if<00:01:17.159> I<00:01:17.280> click<00:01:17.460> on<00:01:17.579> that

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
want to show you if I click on that

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.300 
want to show you if I click on that
again<00:01:18.000> you<00:01:18.869> can<00:01:18.899> see<00:01:19.200> the<00:01:19.320> tiles<00:01:19.560> are<00:01:19.890> slightly

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
again you can see the tiles are slightly

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.340 
again you can see the tiles are slightly
different<00:01:20.670> than<00:01:20.789> they<00:01:20.969> were<00:01:21.000> the<00:01:21.840> first<00:01:22.079> time

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
different than they were the first time

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:23.990 
different than they were the first time
so<00:01:23.100> let's<00:01:23.310> go<00:01:23.430> ahead<00:01:23.490> and<00:01:23.579> have<00:01:23.729> a<00:01:23.789> look<00:01:23.880> at

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
so let's go ahead and have a look at

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.209 
so let's go ahead and have a look at
patterns<00:01:24.329> this<00:01:25.259> is<00:01:25.409> kind<00:01:25.619> of<00:01:25.680> unique<00:01:25.860> you've

00:01:26.209 --> 00:01:26.219 
patterns this is kind of unique you've

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:27.800 
patterns this is kind of unique you've
got<00:01:26.430> some<00:01:26.670> objects<00:01:27.090> down<00:01:27.270> the<00:01:27.360> bottom<00:01:27.630> here

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
got some objects down the bottom here

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:28.940 
got some objects down the bottom here
and<00:01:27.840> they've<00:01:28.020> got<00:01:28.170> patterns<00:01:28.530> within<00:01:28.740> the

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
and they've got patterns within the

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.590 
and they've got patterns within the
object<00:01:29.310> that<00:01:29.460> match<00:01:29.729> the<00:01:29.969> kind<00:01:30.180> of<00:01:30.299> pattern<00:01:30.509> on

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
object that match the kind of pattern on

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.649 
object that match the kind of pattern on
the<00:01:30.719> top<00:01:30.930> so<00:01:31.619> for<00:01:31.770> example<00:01:32.359> you<00:01:33.359> know<00:01:33.509> the

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
the top so for example you know the

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:43.389 
the top so for example you know the
Sheep<00:01:33.899> would<00:01:34.530> be<00:01:34.740> this<00:01:34.950> one<00:01:35.990> umbrella<00:01:37.609> and<00:01:39.049> so

00:01:43.389 --> 00:01:43.399 

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:59.149 

the<00:01:44.399> water<00:01:46.280> see<00:01:47.280> inside<00:01:56.600> and<00:01:57.619> so<00:01:58.619> on<00:01:58.770> and<00:01:58.920> again

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
the water see inside and so on and again

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:00.800 
the water see inside and so on and again
the<00:01:59.310> pictures<00:01:59.700> and<00:01:59.880> the<00:01:59.939> tiles<00:02:00.210> will<00:02:00.479> change

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
the pictures and the tiles will change

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.090 
the pictures and the tiles will change
if<00:02:01.020> you<00:02:01.140> replay<00:02:01.499> that<00:02:01.829> over<00:02:02.310> and<00:02:02.460> over<00:02:02.640> again

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.100 
if you replay that over and over again

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.070 
if you replay that over and over again
so<00:02:03.640> look<00:02:03.760> at<00:02:03.820> the<00:02:03.909> third<00:02:04.120> one<00:02:04.360> which<00:02:04.480> is<00:02:04.510> forms

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:05.080 
so look at the third one which is forms

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:07.649 
so look at the third one which is forms
and<00:02:05.920> if<00:02:06.010> we<00:02:06.159> based<00:02:06.400> on<00:02:06.550> the<00:02:06.580> shapes<00:02:06.940> of<00:02:07.240> the

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:07.659 
and if we based on the shapes of the

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:09.840 
and if we based on the shapes of the
objects<00:02:08.140> so<00:02:08.830> you<00:02:08.860> can<00:02:09.039> see<00:02:09.280> you've<00:02:09.429> got<00:02:09.490> things

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:09.850 
objects so you can see you've got things

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:12.930 
objects so you can see you've got things
like<00:02:09.970> an<00:02:10.090> orange<00:02:11.040> you've<00:02:12.040> got<00:02:12.190> things<00:02:12.370> also

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
like an orange you've got things also

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:14.400 
like an orange you've got things also
round<00:02:13.390> but<00:02:13.600> it's<00:02:13.690> got<00:02:13.780> a<00:02:13.810> hole<00:02:14.050> in<00:02:14.230> the<00:02:14.290> middle

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.410 
round but it's got a hole in the middle

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:17.120 
round but it's got a hole in the middle
okay

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:37.320 

skirt<00:02:18.130> over<00:02:18.760> here<00:02:35.580> so<00:02:36.580> you<00:02:36.670> get<00:02:36.790> the<00:02:36.880> idea<00:02:36.940> and

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330 
skirt over here so you get the idea and

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:39.990 
skirt over here so you get the idea and
again<00:02:37.870> within<00:02:38.140> that<00:02:38.290> it<00:02:38.739> will<00:02:39.000> slightly

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
again within that it will slightly

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.610 
again within that it will slightly
change<00:02:40.180> if<00:02:40.630> you<00:02:40.720> get<00:02:40.840> them<00:02:40.959> wrong<00:02:41.140> they

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
change if you get them wrong they

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.850 
change if you get them wrong they
