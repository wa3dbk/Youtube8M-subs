00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:07.620
 here a super video for our 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:11.759
 dearly origami channel and well 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:14.700
 will know some some youtubers of the 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:16.949
 tomorrow some youtubers have already gone up 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.300
 this news of insurance already know they are going to 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.210
 say hey yori so that the turn 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.490
 you just want to make money blah blah blah and 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:27.570
 that you want to earn a lot of money for a 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:30.660
 I'm not really going to solve 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.759
 some doubts because on facebook more in 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.860
 facebook and on twitter almost some me 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.840
 they ask when it wavers 0.12 but in 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.370
 facebook are painting me with the 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.800
 damn questions though if they can 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.020
 keep asking me jordi gonzález blah 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.809
 blah blah blah and you can know how 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.309
 we will remember here in the image that they are 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.920
 seeing here not the thin ones because the 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:55.110
 spending has been the show image and 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:57.899
 Cervantes says that 0.11 and 0.12 and 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:01.170
 says that the 0.12 or the beta group tester 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:03.420
 the sale goes out this week so it's going 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.409
 to be informing and that the groups that 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.420
 be there in 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:09.210
 in the good group the groups that are 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.249
 there in google they are false 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.200
 groups that say 0.12 beta are fake 

00:01:11.249 --> 00:01:15.929
 because they have not announced it when 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.810
 announce it will be official information 

00:01:15.929 --> 00:01:21.990
 of them we are going to be able to join the 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:25.409
 beta group tester if they will know some 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:27.929
 they need the main craft bought for 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:30.390
 do beta tester but the question that 

00:01:27.929 --> 00:01:32.789
 many were born giorgi that happened with the 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.670
 0.12 is going to go up clear that if a 

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:37.890
 glimpses I had them on mediafire 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.439
 dropbox and I win even though I do not think I 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.869
 I earn nothing but dropbox 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:45.090
 and mediafire which is the easiest and 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:48.030
 some ask me manual giorgi is going to 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:51.390
 leaving on July 29 is a long time 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:54.630
 as we will see I am and I am and Servando 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:57.299
 He said he was leaving the beta group 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.759
 tester this week this is that today 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:03.450
 we are like to wednesday I think so 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:06.149
 it may come out on Thursday or Friday 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:09.270
 not on Saturday maybe it may be that the 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:12.120
 beta group tester but let's make a 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:16.620
 theory here that they listen to me can come out 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:18.870
 the 0.12 this week get happy yes 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.580
 and because I tell you this because the version 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:24.480
 the van they have to prepare 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:26.850
 because I guess that as it goes for 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.160
 windows 10 edition is a little more 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:31.200
 difficult to get wins in your store or you are 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:34.440
 something more difficult android as you will know 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:37.410
 android is this this universal your store 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:39.930
 so you can upload some apec like that 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:41.970
 within about four hours it is updated 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:44.580
 the play store is updated but in 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:46.620
 I change the windows phone stores and 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:47.910
 Windows stores Windows 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.220
 computer will take a long time 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:51.180
 update let's say three or four 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.280
 days not 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:56.099
 but on android they are going to start with the 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:58.650
 wii so go away waiting it's not going to 

00:02:56.099 --> 00:03:01.500
 out on 29 the wild 1 are going to start 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:05.219
 leave next week we say today 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:08.370
 we are who knows what my god would say 

00:03:05.219 --> 00:03:09.490
 pam pam pam we are on Wednesday and something 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:12.240
 do not 

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:15.730
 that is, 15 days are missing, 14 are not missing 

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:17.050
 so let's go calculating maybe 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:20.080
 may this week come out very 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:22.180
 likely to come out very next week 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:24.790
 to start the güixas to say 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:27.160
 the ior and when it leaves will 1 next 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:28.900
 week maybe or this week but not 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:30.790
 I think that this week I say that the other 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.800
 the other because they have to go 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:34.720
 preparing already have to go watching books 

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:37.120
 for what 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:39.490
 when they launch windows 10 seville and 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:41.680
 I do not have more books anymore because I like them 

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:45.010
 I said it costs a lot to update it in the 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:48.489
 bone computer store 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:51.400
 and then more than more more news more 

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:54.250
 news says tomás or that is already going to 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:57.650
 can this be good here in this tweet like 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:59.840
 come the enchantment table 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:01.480
 but he says he has a little book and 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:05.150
 says that they shine in the dark 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:08.120
 they shine in the darkness they shine in 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:10.819
 the super darkness and I stayed like that 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:12.650
 as equality is fine it's fine that 

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:14.150
 they glow in the dark says he's going to 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:15.859
 let him liked that it's going to be 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:19.130
 a this pocket feature 

00:04:15.859 --> 00:04:21.789
 edition is my tongue the issues more 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:21.789
 news 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:25.910
 more I think that there is nothing else the group 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:28.190

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:30.620
