they got to worry about them getting in

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:32.180 
they got to worry about them getting in
your<00:03:31.170> head<00:03:31.230> you<00:03:31.590> know<00:03:31.680> there's<00:03:32.010> a<00:03:32.040> lot<00:03:32.070> of

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
your head you know there's a lot of

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:35.390 
your head you know there's a lot of
really<00:03:32.640> interesting<00:03:33.420> level<00:03:34.350> design<00:03:34.620> but<00:03:34.800> just

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
really interesting level design but just

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.640 
really interesting level design but just
when<00:03:35.760> we<00:03:35.850> took<00:03:36.000> around<00:03:36.240> the<00:03:36.480> we<00:03:37.140> took<00:03:37.290> away<00:03:37.470> the

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 
when we took around the we took away the

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:40.160 
when we took around the we took away the
restriction<00:03:38.370> that<00:03:38.420> you<00:03:39.420> know<00:03:39.540> the<00:03:39.810> gravity

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
restriction that you know the gravity

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:43.670 
restriction that you know the gravity
has<00:03:40.350> to<00:03:40.500> always<00:03:40.620> be<00:03:40.860> down<00:03:41.480> you<00:03:42.480> know<00:03:42.600> and<00:03:42.630> up<00:03:43.470> is

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
has to always be down you know and up is

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:44.840 
has to always be down you know and up is
up<00:03:43.800> and<00:03:43.950> down<00:03:44.040> is<00:03:44.220> out<00:03:44.310> once<00:03:44.490> we<00:03:44.580> took<00:03:44.700> away

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:44.850 
up and down is out once we took away

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:46.160 
up and down is out once we took away
that<00:03:44.910> design<00:03:45.360> restriction<00:03:45.780> their<00:03:45.900> loudest

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170 
that design restriction their loudest

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:48.350 
that design restriction their loudest
they<00:03:46.320> really<00:03:46.560> explore<00:03:46.920> what<00:03:47.880> the<00:03:48.000> different

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:48.360 
they really explore what the different

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:50.330 
they really explore what the different
you<00:03:48.690> know<00:03:49.140> kind<00:03:49.500> of<00:03:49.560> stage<00:03:49.770> designs<00:03:50.100> are<00:03:50.250> good

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
you know kind of stage designs are good

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:52.640 
you know kind of stage designs are good
people<00:03:50.580> of<00:03:50.640> it<00:03:50.850> so<00:03:51.810> what's<00:03:52.020> the<00:03:52.140> intent<00:03:52.530> behind

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
people of it so what's the intent behind

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:54.560 
people of it so what's the intent behind
the<00:03:53.070> development<00:03:53.250> of<00:03:53.490> this<00:03:53.640> like<00:03:53.880> we<00:03:54.210> want<00:03:54.450> to

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:54.570 
the development of this like we want to

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:56.380 
the development of this like we want to
go<00:03:54.900> back<00:03:55.080> to<00:03:55.230> the<00:03:55.290> original<00:03:55.440> game<00:03:55.800> but<00:03:56.160> with<00:03:56.280> a

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:56.390 
go back to the original game but with a

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:59.540 
go back to the original game but with a
modern<00:03:57.390> twist<00:03:57.630> to<00:03:57.990> everything<00:03:58.380> um<00:03:59.070> I<00:03:59.310> don't

00:03:59.540 --> 00:03:59.550 
modern twist to everything um I don't

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:01.130 
modern twist to everything um I don't
think<00:03:59.700> that's<00:03:59.910> it's<00:04:00.330> more<00:04:00.540> about<00:04:00.720> the<00:04:00.930> fact

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:01.140 
think that's it's more about the fact

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:02.600 
think that's it's more about the fact
that<00:04:01.230> like<00:04:01.470> you<00:04:01.680> know<00:04:01.710> Sonic's<00:04:02.310> all<00:04:02.430> about

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:02.610 
that like you know Sonic's all about

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:04.460 
that like you know Sonic's all about
innovation<00:04:02.790> all<00:04:03.150> about<00:04:03.330> moving<00:04:03.480> forward<00:04:03.600> but

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:04.470 
innovation all about moving forward but

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:06.080 
innovation all about moving forward but
at<00:04:04.620> the<00:04:04.710> same<00:04:04.920> time<00:04:05.310> you<00:04:05.700> know<00:04:05.790> there's<00:04:06.000> a<00:04:06.060> lot

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 
at the same time you know there's a lot

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:07.940 
at the same time you know there's a lot
of<00:04:06.270> stuff<00:04:06.600> that<00:04:06.630> there's<00:04:07.290> a<00:04:07.380> lot<00:04:07.470> of<00:04:07.530> history

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:07.950 
of stuff that there's a lot of history

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:09.920 
of stuff that there's a lot of history
there's<00:04:08.190> a<00:04:08.250> lot<00:04:08.400> of<00:04:08.430> stuff<00:04:09.270> that<00:04:09.300> sonic<00:04:09.810> has

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:09.930 
there's a lot of stuff that sonic has

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:11.810 
there's a lot of stuff that sonic has
just<00:04:10.170> associated<00:04:10.740> with<00:04:10.860> I<00:04:10.890> mean<00:04:11.070> it's<00:04:11.670> all

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:11.820 
just associated with I mean it's all

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:13.580 
just associated with I mean it's all
about<00:04:12.000> you<00:04:12.240> know<00:04:12.270> bridging<00:04:12.960> that<00:04:12.990> gap<00:04:13.290> and

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 
about you know bridging that gap and

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:15.860 
about you know bridging that gap and
hitting<00:04:13.860> trying<00:04:14.850> to<00:04:14.940> keep<00:04:15.090> it<00:04:15.180> fresh<00:04:15.390> new<00:04:15.660> but

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:15.870 
hitting trying to keep it fresh new but

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:17.570 
hitting trying to keep it fresh new but
also<00:04:16.019> delivering<00:04:16.500> on<00:04:16.650> something<00:04:17.040> that<00:04:17.070> people

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:17.580 
also delivering on something that people

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:19.400 
also delivering on something that people
can<00:04:17.730> relate<00:04:17.850> to<00:04:18.209> yeah<00:04:18.570> right<00:04:18.989> here<00:04:19.109> we<00:04:19.230> have

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:19.410 
can relate to yeah right here we have

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:20.930 
can relate to yeah right here we have
one<00:04:19.620> of<00:04:19.650> the<00:04:19.739> new<00:04:19.859> color<00:04:20.070> powers<00:04:20.400> this<00:04:20.640> is<00:04:20.790> the

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 
one of the new color powers this is the

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:23.060 
one of the new color powers this is the
asteroid<00:04:21.570> color<00:04:21.750> power<00:04:21.959> its<00:04:22.650> control<00:04:22.980> with

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:23.070 
asteroid color power its control with

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:24.620 
asteroid color power its control with
the<00:04:23.190> with<00:04:23.430> the<00:04:23.580> gamepad<00:04:24.090> so<00:04:24.240> you<00:04:24.330> can't<00:04:24.540> really

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:24.630 
the with the gamepad so you can't really

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:27.520 
the with the gamepad so you can't really
see<00:04:25.110> how<00:04:25.500> we<00:04:25.560> talk<00:04:26.070> control<00:04:26.370> of<00:04:26.460> it<00:04:26.550> is<00:04:26.640> feeling

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:27.530 
see how we talk control of it is feeling

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:29.630 
see how we talk control of it is feeling
not<00:04:28.530> grabbing<00:04:28.920> footage<00:04:29.280> that<00:04:29.400> way<00:04:29.490> but

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:29.640 
not grabbing footage that way but

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:31.250 
not grabbing footage that way but
basically<00:04:30.330> do<00:04:30.540> that<00:04:30.690> to<00:04:30.810> control<00:04:31.110> the

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:31.260 
basically do that to control the

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:35.370 
basically do that to control the
character<00:04:31.860> and<00:04:33.110> Wow

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:35.380 
character and Wow

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:38.520 
character and Wow
and<00:04:35.700> Sonic<00:04:36.700> and<00:04:36.850> spaceless<00:04:37.450> grabbed<00:04:38.260> up<00:04:38.410> all

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:38.530 
and Sonic and spaceless grabbed up all

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:40.830 
and Sonic and spaceless grabbed up all
the<00:04:38.710> stuff<00:04:39.070> and<00:04:39.340> then<00:04:39.460> you<00:04:40.240> can<00:04:40.390> access<00:04:40.690> these

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:40.840 
the stuff and then you can access these

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:44.990 
the stuff and then you can access these
secret<00:04:41.260> zones<00:04:41.820> and<00:04:42.820> try<00:04:43.030> to<00:04:43.090> get<00:04:43.270> these<00:04:43.450> uh<00:04:43.480> I

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:45.000 
secret zones and try to get these uh I

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.820 
secret zones and try to get these uh I
can<00:04:46.000> do<00:04:46.210> this<00:04:46.360> without<00:04:46.510> getting<00:04:46.930> myself

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:47.830 
can do this without getting myself

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:53.250 
can do this without getting myself
killed<00:04:50.460> so<00:04:51.460> close<00:04:51.760> yeah<00:04:52.330> you<00:04:52.660> got<00:04:52.810> to<00:04:52.930> get<00:04:53.050> that

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:53.260 
killed so close yeah you got to get that

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.800 
killed so close yeah you got to get that
I<00:04:53.700> don't<00:04:54.700> think<00:04:54.820> I<00:04:54.850> have<00:04:54.940> enough<00:04:54.970> so<00:04:55.360> basically

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:55.810 
I don't think I have enough so basically

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:58.170 
I don't think I have enough so basically
the<00:04:55.870> more<00:04:55.990> debris<00:04:56.260> you<00:04:56.350> get<00:04:56.760> the<00:04:57.760> better<00:04:57.910> the

00:04:58.170 --> 00:04:58.180 
the more debris you get the better the

00:04:58.180 --> 00:04:59.550 
the more debris you get the better the
base<00:04:58.480> for<00:04:58.660> the<00:04:58.720> higher<00:04:58.930> you<00:04:59.080> can<00:04:59.200> jump<00:04:59.410> with

00:04:59.550 --> 00:04:59.560 
base for the higher you can jump with

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:01.530 
base for the higher you can jump with
that<00:04:59.680> stuff<00:04:59.890> you<00:04:59.980> can<00:05:00.130> do<00:05:00.250> so<00:05:00.490> I<00:05:00.700> did<00:05:01.030> a<00:05:01.060> poor

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:01.540 
that stuff you can do so I did a poor

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:03.270 
that stuff you can do so I did a poor
job<00:05:01.570> of<00:05:01.780> that<00:05:01.990> and<00:05:02.170> doing<00:05:02.500> at<00:05:02.650> that<00:05:02.680> time<00:05:03.010> so

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:03.280 
job of that and doing at that time so

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:05.040 
job of that and doing at that time so
maybe<00:05:03.820> on<00:05:03.970> the<00:05:04.060> next<00:05:04.090> time<00:05:04.450> so<00:05:04.750> the<00:05:04.870> colors

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:05.050 
maybe on the next time so the colors

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:07.440 
maybe on the next time so the colors
powers<00:05:05.590> from<00:05:05.800> sonic<00:05:06.430> colors<00:05:06.700> and<00:05:07.120> returning

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:07.450 
powers from sonic colors and returning

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:09.300 
powers from sonic colors and returning
in<00:05:07.630> this<00:05:07.750> with<00:05:07.960> for<00:05:08.140> anyone<00:05:08.530> yes<00:05:08.980> exactly

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:09.310 
in this with for anyone yes exactly

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:10.620 
in this with for anyone yes exactly
there's<00:05:09.580> a<00:05:09.670> couple<00:05:09.820> returning<00:05:10.240> ones<00:05:10.390> and<00:05:10.570> we

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:10.630

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:25.770 
based moves but it's just sort of a

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:27.650 
based moves but it's just sort of a
different<00:06:26.100> interpretation<00:06:26.310> okay<00:06:26.970> as<00:06:27.240> I<00:06:27.360> still

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:27.660
