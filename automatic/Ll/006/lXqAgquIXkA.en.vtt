00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:47.660 
doesn't sound really great but what I

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:49.060 
doesn't sound really great but what I
like<00:02:47.750> about<00:02:48.140> a<00:02:48.290> backpacker

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:49.070 
like about a backpacker

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:54.130 
like about a backpacker
is<00:02:49.630> it's<00:02:50.630> almost<00:02:50.900> a<00:02:51.230> full-scale<00:02:51.739> neck<00:02:52.489> so<00:02:53.140> it's

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140 
is it's almost a full-scale neck so it's

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:55.870 
is it's almost a full-scale neck so it's
shorter<00:02:54.530> you<00:02:54.709> know<00:02:54.770> it's<00:02:54.950> a<00:02:54.980> 24<00:02:55.430> inch<00:02:55.580> scale<00:02:55.820> I

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:55.880 
shorter you know it's a 24 inch scale I

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.180 
shorter you know it's a 24 inch scale I
think<00:02:56.270> so<00:02:57.170> it<00:02:57.290> is<00:02:57.440> shorter<00:02:57.770> than<00:02:57.860> even<00:02:58.130> a

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.190 
think so it is shorter than even a

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:01.210 
think so it is shorter than even a
double<00:02:58.489> dot<00:02:58.670> but<00:02:58.970> but<00:02:59.269> it's<00:03:00.070> you<00:03:01.070> know<00:03:01.100> it's

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220 
double dot but but it's you know it's

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:03.340 
double dot but but it's you know it's
long<00:03:01.489> to<00:03:01.670> scare<00:03:01.940> than<00:03:02.150> some<00:03:02.299> of<00:03:02.390> my<00:03:02.450> other<00:03:02.540> like

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120 
some smaller traffic guitars they have

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.570 
some smaller traffic guitars they have
really<00:03:05.630> short<00:03:05.810> necks<00:03:06.200> and<00:03:06.470> it's<00:03:07.220> like<00:03:07.370> playing

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:07.580 
really short necks and it's like playing

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:09.039 
really short necks and it's like playing
a<00:03:07.730> ukulele<00:03:07.880> or<00:03:08.269> something<00:03:08.660> like<00:03:08.720> that

a ukulele or something like that
listen<00:03:09.530> those<00:03:10.130> make<00:03:10.370> you<00:03:10.400> stretch<00:03:10.730> a<00:03:10.760> little

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:10.940 
listen those make you stretch a little

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:14.289 
listen those make you stretch a little
bit<00:03:11.090> and<00:03:11.590> the<00:03:12.590> things<00:03:12.799> I<00:03:12.950> don't<00:03:13.010> like<00:03:13.340> about<00:03:13.519> it

00:03:14.289 --> 00:03:14.299 
bit and the things I don't like about it

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:17.140 
bit and the things I don't like about it
this<00:03:14.750> is<00:03:14.900> an<00:03:15.019> early<00:03:15.170> backpacker<00:03:16.040> but<00:03:16.850> you<00:03:17.060> know

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150 
this is an early backpacker but you know

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:18.789 
this is an early backpacker but you know
one<00:03:17.330> of<00:03:17.360> the<00:03:17.480> very<00:03:17.570> first<00:03:17.810> ones<00:03:18.170> I<00:03:18.320> think<00:03:18.590> and

00:03:18.789 --> 00:03:18.799 
one of the very first ones I think and

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:22.509 
one of the very first ones I think and
it<00:03:19.310> has<00:03:19.400> a<00:03:19.430> flat<00:03:19.790> neck<00:03:20.200> no<00:03:21.200> radius<00:03:21.680> to<00:03:22.190> the<00:03:22.220> neck

00:03:22.509 --> 00:03:22.519 
it has a flat neck no radius to the neck

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:24.940 
it has a flat neck no radius to the neck
and<00:03:22.970> so<00:03:23.239> it's<00:03:23.420> a<00:03:23.480> little<00:03:23.630> tricky<00:03:23.900> and<00:03:24.350> the<00:03:24.620> next

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:24.950 
and so it's a little tricky and the next

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:26.500 
and so it's a little tricky and the next
the<00:03:25.130> fingerboard<00:03:25.400> consequently<00:03:26.150> is<00:03:26.239> not<00:03:26.390> as

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:26.510 
the fingerboard consequently is not as

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:28.979 
the fingerboard consequently is not as
comfortable<00:03:27.019> as<00:03:27.230> I<00:03:27.950> would<00:03:28.130> like<00:03:28.280> it<00:03:28.430> to<00:03:28.459> be

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:28.989 
comfortable as I would like it to be

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:31.570 
comfortable as I would like it to be
because<00:03:29.989> of<00:03:30.019> the<00:03:30.230> way<00:03:30.410> it's<00:03:30.590> built<00:03:30.890> with<00:03:31.370> no

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:31.580 
because of the way it's built with no

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:34.449 
because of the way it's built with no
neck<00:03:32.090> angle<00:03:32.600> the<00:03:33.530> actions<00:03:33.980> tend<00:03:34.250> to<00:03:34.340> be<00:03:34.430> a

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:34.459 
neck angle the actions tend to be a

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:35.590 
neck angle the actions tend to be a
little<00:03:34.700> high<00:03:34.880> on<00:03:34.910> them

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:35.600 
little high on them

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:38.650 
little high on them
mine<00:03:36.140> has<00:03:36.380> no<00:03:36.980> shadow<00:03:37.280> there<00:03:37.610> and<00:03:38.030> your<00:03:38.390> could

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:38.660 
mine has no shadow there and your could

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:40.930 
mine has no shadow there and your could
go<00:03:38.780> down<00:03:38.959> below<00:03:39.350> and<00:03:39.799> I<00:03:40.340> could<00:03:40.489> probably<00:03:40.610> give

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:40.940 
go down below and I could probably give

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:42.340 
go down below and I could probably give
it<00:03:40.970> a<00:03:41.060> bit<00:03:41.239> of<00:03:41.299> a<00:03:41.360> radius<00:03:41.750> out<00:03:41.959> of<00:03:42.110> it<00:03:42.200> right

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:42.350 
it a bit of a radius out of it right

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:44.740 
it a bit of a radius out of it right
there<00:03:42.620> even<00:03:42.950> but<00:03:43.130> you<00:03:43.549> know<00:03:44.269> the<00:03:44.390> action<00:03:44.660> is

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:44.750 
there even but you know the action is

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:46.630 
there even but you know the action is
playable<00:03:44.989> on<00:03:45.290> it<00:03:45.440> extra<00:03:45.860> light<00:03:46.010> strings<00:03:46.430> are

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:46.640 
playable on it extra light strings are

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:48.610 
playable on it extra light strings are
now<00:03:46.820> is<00:03:47.420> it<00:03:47.660> take<00:03:47.840> cement<00:03:48.170> to<00:03:48.260> get<00:03:48.410> used<00:03:48.560> to

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:48.620 
now is it take cement to get used to

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:50.259 
now is it take cement to get used to
because<00:03:48.830> your<00:03:49.100> strings<00:03:49.310> a<00:03:49.459> flatter<00:03:49.790> across

00:03:50.259 --> 00:03:50.269 
because your strings a flatter across

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:53.289 
because your strings a flatter across
here<00:03:50.600> across<00:03:50.780> the<00:03:51.680> bridge<00:03:51.890> then<00:03:52.250> on<00:03:52.400> a<00:03:52.430> real

00:03:53.289 --> 00:03:53.299 
here across the bridge then on a real

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:56.110 
here across the bridge then on a real
guitar<00:03:53.540> that<00:03:54.110> with<00:03:54.380> a<00:03:54.410> 20<00:03:55.370> inch<00:03:55.519> radius<00:03:55.760> or

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:56.120 
guitar that with a 20 inch radius or

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:57.759 
guitar that with a 20 inch radius or
something<00:03:56.390> like<00:03:56.450> that<00:03:56.510> on<00:03:56.810> the<00:03:56.959> on<00:03:57.140> the<00:03:57.470> saddle

00:03:57.759 --> 00:03:57.769 
something like that on the on the saddle

00:03:57.769 --> 00:03:59.680 
something like that on the on the saddle
so<00:03:58.640> that<00:03:58.760> does<00:03:58.940> take<00:03:59.120> a<00:03:59.150> little<00:03:59.299> bit<00:03:59.420> of<00:03:59.540> time

00:03:59.680 --> 00:03:59.690 
so that does take a little bit of time

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:03.250 
so that does take a little bit of time
to<00:03:59.810> get<00:03:59.930> used<00:04:00.110> to<00:04:00.350> but<00:04:00.560> I<00:04:00.980> don't<00:04:01.910> know<00:04:02.260> after

to get used to but I don't know after

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.339 
to get used to but I don't know after
after<00:04:03.770> the<00:04:04.489> after<00:04:05.330> the<00:04:05.420> hospital<00:04:05.630> episode
