is<00:01:23.420> going<00:01:23.570> to<00:01:23.600> be<00:01:23.689> exactly<00:01:24.290> the<00:01:24.500> same<00:01:24.670> whether

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670 
is going to be exactly the same whether

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:27.820 
is going to be exactly the same whether
you're<00:01:25.759> playing<00:01:26.090> a<00:01:26.450> six<00:01:27.080> string<00:01:27.320> or<00:01:27.530> twelve

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:27.830

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:32.920 
string so if you have a twelve string at
home<00:01:30.830> then<00:01:31.430> use<00:01:31.729> that<00:01:31.759> if<00:01:32.090> not<00:01:32.299> a<00:01:32.330> six<00:01:32.720> string

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:32.930

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:33.640 
home then use that if not a six string
will<00:01:33.079> work<00:01:33.200> just<00:01:33.229> fine

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:33.650
