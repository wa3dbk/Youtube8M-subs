00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:35.160 
shoulders open and relaxed should attack
slightly<00:02:33.460> so<00:02:33.820> it<00:02:33.940> feels<00:02:34.150> like<00:02:34.360> the<00:02:34.720> top<00:02:34.930> of<00:02:35.080> the

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
slightly so it feels like the top of the

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:39.030 
slightly so it feels like the top of the
heat<00:02:35.410> pulls<00:02:36.280> up<00:02:36.610> I<00:02:37.440> find<00:02:38.440> that<00:02:38.560> if<00:02:38.680> you<00:02:38.770> think

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
heat pulls up I find that if you think

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.770 
heat pulls up I find that if you think
too<00:02:39.280> hard<00:02:39.610> about<00:02:39.670> each<00:02:40.000> of<00:02:40.150> these<00:02:40.270> things<00:02:40.540> that

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
too hard about each of these things that

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.949 
too hard about each of these things that
actually<00:02:41.170> can<00:02:41.380> teach<00:02:41.980> your<00:02:42.190> body<00:02:42.430> up<00:02:42.640> so<00:02:42.959> it's

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:43.959 
actually can teach your body up so it's

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:45.900 
actually can teach your body up so it's
good<00:02:44.110> to<00:02:44.140> spend<00:02:44.470> some<00:02:44.590> time<00:02:44.980> thinking<00:02:45.340> about

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 
good to spend some time thinking about

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:48.510 
good to spend some time thinking about
these<00:02:46.390> things<00:02:46.800> but<00:02:47.800> then<00:02:48.010> when<00:02:48.220> you<00:02:48.310> go<00:02:48.489> to

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:48.520 
these things but then when you go to

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:51.660 
these things but then when you go to
movement<00:02:49.209> to<00:02:49.390> the<00:02:49.540> stars<00:02:50.100> let<00:02:51.100> go<00:02:51.340> of<00:02:51.459> all<00:02:51.610> that

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 
movement to the stars let go of all that

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:56.790 
movement to the stars let go of all that
and<00:02:52.180> just<00:02:52.680> sit<00:02:53.680> down<00:02:53.830> and<00:02:54.340> try<00:02:55.330> and<00:02:55.600> relax<00:02:55.930> into

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:56.800 
and just sit down and try and relax into

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:00.330 
and just sit down and try and relax into
the<00:02:57.160> posture<00:02:58.470> something<00:02:59.470> that<00:02:59.620> can<00:02:59.890> help<00:03:00.130> as

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
the posture something that can help as

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.090 
the posture something that can help as
well<00:03:00.370> is<00:03:01.150> to<00:03:01.360> just<00:03:01.750> bounce<00:03:02.380> up<00:03:02.709> and<00:03:02.860> down<00:03:02.950> a

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:03.100 
well is to just bounce up and down a

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:05.400 
well is to just bounce up and down a
little<00:03:03.400> bit<00:03:03.580> much<00:03:04.390> as<00:03:04.570> if<00:03:04.750> you<00:03:04.930> are<00:03:04.989> riding<00:03:05.019> the

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410 
little bit much as if you are riding the

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:10.090 
little bit much as if you are riding the
horse<00:03:05.500> and<00:03:06.400> the<00:03:06.640> skins<00:03:07.150> to<00:03:07.540> relax<00:03:07.930> all<00:03:08.769> of<00:03:09.040> the

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:10.100 
horse and the skins to relax all of the

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:12.100 
horse and the skins to relax all of the
things<00:03:10.430> lined<00:03:10.820> up<00:03:11.030> pretty<00:03:11.510> much<00:03:11.690> the<00:03:11.930> way<00:03:12.050> you

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:12.110 
things lined up pretty much the way you

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:17.050 
things lined up pretty much the way you
want<00:03:12.410> them<00:03:12.500> today<00:03:12.680> so<00:03:15.670> that's<00:03:16.670> your<00:03:16.850> whole
