same base design of the orange but with
this<00:01:15.030> nice<00:01:15.299> black<00:01:15.930> lines<00:01:16.320> going<00:01:16.650> through<00:01:16.770> it

this nice black lines going through it
it<00:01:17.580> is<00:01:17.759> still<00:01:18.030> LS<00:01:18.659> 0<00:01:19.259> 7<00:01:19.860> so<00:01:20.850> that<00:01:21.030> hasn't

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
it is still LS 0 7 so that hasn't

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.899 
it is still LS 0 7 so that hasn't
changed<00:01:21.509> at<00:01:22.080> all<00:01:22.200> but<00:01:22.979> still<00:01:23.729> very

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
changed at all but still very

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.969 
changed at all but still very
nice-looking<00:01:24.630> especially<00:01:25.560> if<00:01:25.619> you<00:01:25.680> like<00:01:25.830> the

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
nice-looking especially if you like the

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:33.260 
nice-looking especially if you like the
color<00:01:26.159> red<00:01:26.250> like<00:01:26.580> I<00:01:26.729> do<00:01:31.009> so<00:01:32.009> the<00:01:32.220> same<00:01:32.490> turn<00:01:33.090> on

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
color red like I do so the same turn on

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.120 
color red like I do so the same turn on
noise<00:01:33.509> and<00:01:33.930> the<00:01:34.200> button<00:01:34.500> back<00:01:34.710> there<00:01:34.979> is<00:01:35.100> a

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
noise and the button back there is a

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:47.179 
noise and the button back there is a
little<00:01:35.340> bit<00:01:35.549> different<00:01:45.200> so<00:01:46.200> it<00:01:46.320> all<00:01:46.530> activates

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
little bit different so it all activates

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.429 
little bit different so it all activates
invest<00:01:47.729> noises<00:01:48.299> since<00:01:48.570> boozing<00:01:49.020> games<00:01:49.200> not

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
invest noises since boozing games not

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.580 
invest noises since boozing games not
associated<00:01:49.920> with<00:01:50.159> the<00:01:50.509> invest<00:01:51.509> game<00:01:51.810> and<00:01:52.079> has

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
associated with the invest game and has

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.950 
associated with the invest game and has
lack<00:01:52.860> seed<00:01:53.189> I<00:01:53.460> don't<00:01:53.640> even<00:01:53.820> think<00:01:53.970> exists<00:01:54.780> in

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
lack seed I don't even think exists in

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.889 
lack seed I don't even think exists in
the<00:01:55.079> actual<00:01:55.560> diamond<00:01:55.920> world<00:01:56.719> you<00:01:57.719> don't

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
the actual diamond world you don't

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:58.990 
the actual diamond world you don't
really<00:01:58.079> have<00:01:58.200> to<00:01:58.350> worry<00:01:58.530> too<00:01:58.770> much<00:01:58.799> about

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.000 
really have to worry too much about

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:05.090 
really have to worry too much about
accuracy<00:02:00.000> there<00:02:00.240> so<00:02:00.869> pretty<00:02:01.200> neat

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.120 

no<00:02:06.060> note<00:02:06.330> there<00:02:06.540> is<00:02:06.689> still<00:02:07.049> an<00:02:07.170> LED<00:02:07.680> in<00:02:07.950> there

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.130 
no note there is still an LED in there

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:09.980 
no note there is still an LED in there
and<00:02:08.310> we'll<00:02:08.459> probably<00:02:08.700> see<00:02:09.179> it<00:02:09.270> hopefully

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:09.990 
and we'll probably see it hopefully

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:12.230 
and we'll probably see it hopefully
pretty<00:02:10.410> soon<00:02:10.610> all<00:02:11.610> right<00:02:11.670> so<00:02:11.940> here's<00:02:12.120> our

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:12.240 
pretty soon all right so here's our

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.510 
pretty soon all right so here's our
sangoku<00:02:12.870> driver<00:02:13.110> we'll<00:02:13.350> take<00:02:13.560> the<00:02:13.739> Bujinkan

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520 
sangoku driver we'll take the Bujinkan

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:17.620 
sangoku driver we'll take the Bujinkan
face<00:02:14.760> plate

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:17.630 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:19.790 

like<00:02:18.630> I<00:02:18.720> said<00:02:18.780> you'll<00:02:19.080> remember<00:02:19.319> that<00:02:19.620> from

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
like I said you'll remember that from

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.890 
like I said you'll remember that from
Cal<00:02:20.069> Reiter<00:02:20.310> Bravo<00:02:20.760> since<00:02:21.000> that's<00:02:21.209> his<00:02:21.540> tune

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
as well so once we do a look at the

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.960 
as well so once we do a look at the
durian<00:02:25.170> lock<00:02:25.500> seed<00:02:25.800> will<00:02:26.459> actually<00:02:26.760> have<00:02:26.940> the

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
durian lock seed will actually have the

that<00:04:40.650> was<00:04:40.740> a<00:04:40.770> weird<00:04:41.070> analogy<00:04:41.250> but<00:04:41.970> it<00:04:42.270> makes

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:42.510 
that was a weird analogy but it makes

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:45.500

sense<00:04:42.750> to<00:04:43.020> me<00:04:43.139> I<00:04:43.169> swear<00:04:43.789> the<00:04:44.789> faceplate<00:04:45.300> is<00:04:45.330> a

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:45.510 
sense to me I swear the faceplate is a

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:47.510 
sense to me I swear the faceplate is a
nice<00:04:45.870> additional<00:04:46.500> bonus<00:04:46.560> just<00:04:46.979> like<00:04:47.190> it<00:04:47.310> was

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:47.520 
nice additional bonus just like it was

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:50.270 
nice additional bonus just like it was
in<00:04:47.910> the<00:04:47.940> budeau<00:04:48.479> lock<00:04:48.750> seat<00:04:49.080> and<00:04:49.349> not<00:04:50.070> only

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:50.280 
in the budeau lock seat and not only

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:52.689 
in the budeau lock seat and not only
that<00:04:50.400> this<00:04:50.880> does<00:04:51.150> activate<00:04:51.690> the<00:04:51.840> rock<00:04:52.050> noise

00:04:52.689 --> 00:04:52.699 
that this does activate the rock noise

00:04:52.699 --> 00:04:55.129 
that this does activate the rock noise
it's<00:04:53.699> definitely<00:04:54.060> worth<00:04:54.210> it<00:04:54.360> I<00:04:54.510> love<00:04:54.780> this

00:04:55.129 --> 00:04:55.139

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:34.650 
about 1800 yen I think standard retail

about 1800 yen I think standard retail
so<00:05:34.949> 1500<00:05:35.820> yen<00:05:35.940> for<00:05:36.210> the<00:05:36.300> lock<00:05:36.479> seed<00:05:36.750> and<00:05:36.990> then

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:37.080 
so 1500 yen for the lock seed and then

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:39.710 
so 1500 yen for the lock seed and then
inbound<00:05:38.010> extra<00:05:38.400> 300<00:05:38.880> yen<00:05:38.970> for<00:05:39.210> the<00:05:39.240> faceplate

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:39.720 
inbound extra 300 yen for the faceplate

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:42.980 
inbound extra 300 yen for the faceplate
so<00:05:40.470> all<00:05:41.070> in<00:05:41.280> all<00:05:41.400> definitely<00:05:41.909> worth<00:05:42.270> it<00:05:42.510> and<00:05:42.720> I

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:42.990
