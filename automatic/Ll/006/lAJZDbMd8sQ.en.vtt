hey this is dima driver here's the
fuselage<00:00:08.210> of<00:00:08.240> my<00:00:08.570> 707<00:00:09.020> that<00:00:09.440> i'm<00:00:09.559> working<00:00:09.680> on

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:10.420 
fuselage of my 707 that i'm working on

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:12.940 
fuselage of my 707 that i'm working on
this<00:00:11.420> still<00:00:11.780> a<00:00:11.809> work<00:00:12.050> in<00:00:12.170> progress<00:00:12.410> this<00:00:12.830> is<00:00:12.920> a

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:12.950 
this still a work in progress this is a

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:18.990 
this still a work in progress this is a
707<00:00:13.610> 120<00:00:14.300> series<00:00:14.600> from<00:00:14.750> 1958<00:00:15.700> this<00:00:16.700> is<00:00:16.910> the

then we'll walk in here to the hangar
and<00:00:29.920> there<00:00:30.920> is<00:00:31.130> my<00:00:31.989> 767<00:00:32.989> delta<00:00:33.550> that<00:00:34.550> my

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:34.760 
and there is my 767 delta that my

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.830 
and there is my 767 delta that my
scratch-build<00:00:35.330> airliner<00:00:37.270> has<00:00:38.270> the<00:00:38.420> fuselage

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:38.840 
scratch-build airliner has the fuselage

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.229 
scratch-build airliner has the fuselage
with<00:00:39.110> the<00:00:39.200> wing<00:00:39.350> behind<00:00:39.680> it<00:00:39.800> it's<00:00:40.640> also<00:00:40.880> still

00:00:41.229 --> 00:00:41.239 
with the wing behind it it's also still

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:42.970 
with the wing behind it it's also still
a<00:00:41.300> work<00:00:41.510> in<00:00:41.660> progress<00:00:41.899> and<00:00:42.290> these<00:00:42.410> planes<00:00:42.710> just

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:42.980 
a work in progress and these planes just

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.120 
a work in progress and these planes just
take<00:00:43.100> a<00:00:43.130> long<00:00:43.430> time<00:00:43.850> to<00:00:43.910> build<00:00:44.680> as<00:00:45.680> you<00:00:45.860> scratch

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:46.130 
take a long time to build as you scratch

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:51.400 
take a long time to build as you scratch
it<00:00:46.160> oh<00:00:46.340> there's<00:00:46.550> no<00:00:46.700> it's<00:00:47.450> not<00:00:47.630> easy<00:00:48.760> and<00:00:50.410> then

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:42.060 
had really bad 70 millimeter ducted fans

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:46.420 
had really bad 70 millimeter ducted fans
I<00:04:42.210> got<00:04:42.330> off<00:04:42.450> ebay<00:04:42.660> they<00:04:42.930> were<00:04:42.990> terrible<00:04:43.380> and

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:46.430 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:48.470 

you<00:04:47.430> know<00:04:47.520> I<00:04:47.580> know<00:04:47.640> if<00:04:47.970> you<00:04:48.060> guys<00:04:48.210> know<00:04:48.450> about

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:48.480 
you know I know if you guys know about

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:56.560 
you know I know if you guys know about
jet<00:04:49.320> airliners<00:04:49.890> and<00:04:50.190> you<00:04:50.850> know<00:04:51.000> about<00:04:51.330> the<00:04:52.910> dc9

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:56.570 

00:04:56.570 --> 00:05:01.220 

you<00:04:57.570> know<00:04:57.690> especially<00:04:57.900> the<00:04:58.320> dc9<00:04:58.770> 51<00:04:59.720> man<00:05:00.720> it's

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:01.230 
you know especially the dc9 51 man it's

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:03.650 
you know especially the dc9 51 man it's
got<00:05:01.380> a<00:05:01.410> short<00:05:01.770> wings<00:05:02.160> been<00:05:02.400> because<00:05:02.760> McDonnell

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:03.660 
got a short wings been because McDonnell

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:04.910 
got a short wings been because McDonnell
Douglas<00:05:03.690> just<00:05:04.200> kept<00:05:04.410> stretching<00:05:04.680> the

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:04.920 
Douglas just kept stretching the

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:06.740 
Douglas just kept stretching the
fuselage<00:05:05.340> of<00:05:05.370> these<00:05:05.730> airliners<00:05:06.300> to<00:05:06.420> make<00:05:06.540> more

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:06.750 
fuselage of these airliners to make more

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:09.020 
fuselage of these airliners to make more
money<00:05:06.900> so<00:05:07.230> they<00:05:07.350> could<00:05:07.500> fit<00:05:07.680> more<00:05:08.030> passengers

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:09.030 
money so they could fit more passengers

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:11.420 
money so they could fit more passengers
in<00:05:09.240> them<00:05:09.330> especially<00:05:10.200> if<00:05:10.710> you<00:05:10.800> look<00:05:10.950> at<00:05:11.070> the<00:05:11.130> DC

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:11.430 
in them especially if you look at the DC

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:15.950 
in them especially if you look at the DC
862<00:05:12.270> series<00:05:12.630> and<00:05:12.810> 63<00:05:13.910> man<00:05:14.910> it's<00:05:15.420> like<00:05:15.480> a<00:05:15.540> pencil

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:15.960 
862 series and 63 man it's like a pencil

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:17.360 
862 series and 63 man it's like a pencil
with<00:05:15.990> wings<00:05:16.320> but<00:05:16.680> the<00:05:16.800> same<00:05:16.980> thing<00:05:17.160> is<00:05:17.340> true

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:17.370 
with wings but the same thing is true

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:21.170 
with wings but the same thing is true
with<00:05:17.610> the<00:05:17.820> dc9<00:05:18.360> especially<00:05:19.350> the<00:05:19.440> dc9<00:05:19.830> 51<00:05:20.370> you

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:21.180 
with the dc9 especially the dc9 51 you

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:24.530 
with the dc9 especially the dc9 51 you
got<00:05:21.390> a<00:05:22.280> short<00:05:23.280> wing<00:05:23.460> span<00:05:23.790> but<00:05:24.270> it's<00:05:24.420> really

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:24.540 
got a short wing span but it's really

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:26.630 
got a short wing span but it's really
the<00:05:24.750> normal<00:05:25.110> wing<00:05:25.230> span<00:05:25.440> for<00:05:25.590> the<00:05:25.650> dc9<00:05:26.130> but

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:26.640 
the normal wing span for the dc9 but

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:28.340 
the normal wing span for the dc9 but
they<00:05:26.730> just<00:05:26.880> stretch<00:05:27.120> the<00:05:27.300> fuselage<00:05:27.660> up<00:05:27.900> then

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:28.350 
they just stretch the fuselage up then

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:31.100 
they just stretch the fuselage up then
they<00:05:29.070> went<00:05:29.220> beyond<00:05:29.580> that<00:05:29.850> and<00:05:30.060> then<00:05:30.750> went<00:05:31.020> to

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:31.110 
they went beyond that and then went to

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:34.070 
they went beyond that and then went to
the<00:05:31.200> 80<00:05:31.470> series<00:05:31.770> the<00:05:32.220> dc9<00:05:32.910> 80<00:05:33.150> which<00:05:33.540> became

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:34.080 
the 80 series the dc9 80 which became

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:37.280 
the 80 series the dc9 80 which became
the<00:05:34.140> md80<00:05:34.710> then<00:05:35.610> here's<00:05:35.850> the<00:05:36.000> bottom<00:05:36.290> here's

little bit of cough abra glass in here

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:10.520 
little bit of cough abra glass in here
to<00:06:08.670> strengthen<00:06:09.030> it<00:06:09.150> but<00:06:10.050> that's<00:06:10.230> all<00:06:10.380> there<00:06:10.500> is

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:10.530 
to strengthen it but that's all there is

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:12.590 
to strengthen it but that's all there is
to<00:06:10.620> it<00:06:10.740> this<00:06:11.430> isn't<00:06:11.790> stress<00:06:12.030> bearing<00:06:12.390> this

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:12.600 
to it this isn't stress bearing this

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:14.780 
to it this isn't stress bearing this
just<00:06:12.840> sits<00:06:13.050> over<00:06:13.590> this<00:06:13.830> is<00:06:13.980> just<00:06:14.130> aerodynamic

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:14.790 
just sits over this is just aerodynamic

cover<00:06:15.500> over<00:06:16.500> the<00:06:16.530> EDF<00:06:17.480> so<00:06:18.480> I'm<00:06:19.440> hoping<00:06:19.650> have

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:19.800 
cover over the EDF so I'm hoping have

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:23.570 
cover over the EDF so I'm hoping have
this<00:06:19.950> done<00:06:20.160> soon<00:06:20.430> and<00:06:21.300> in<00:06:21.540> the<00:06:21.690> air<00:06:21.810> so<00:06:22.770> this<00:06:23.550> is

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:23.580 
this done soon and in the air so this is

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:26.500 
this done soon and in the air so this is
