00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:18.660
 hi everyone i am the owner of 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.410
 bigg all'armonica themselves I did one 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.970
 crap 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.560
 what happened yesterday arrival at home has 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.900
 taken well for us army I take the 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.609
 car to shave I'm wrong 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.769
 brushes instead of putting on the brush 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.599
 for hair I put the brush in which the 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.820
 spend your beard distance meter 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.160
 result from a past I find myself with 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.020
 a strip of long hair like 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.730
 this and the others longer 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:42.149
 I couldn't do anything but cut 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:44.070
 all at the same length thanks for 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.289
 he took her by the ass that surely me 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.879
 you will do in the coming months because before 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.250
 that is normal stuff now it seems 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.690
 the a hole to his name 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.690
 throne of swords what we do 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:57.170
 so anyway the throne of swords ok 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:00.059
 anyway I'm not here to talk about st 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:01.980
 foreman I have combined but I am here 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:06.479
 to tell you about apple tree power ball 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:07.860
 of a harmonica that is a myth because a 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.540
 myth some one of the most harmonics 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.360
 one of the harmonics known to the world 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.490
 the most played in the world is used by 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.110
 great professionals like ad 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.900
 example hour levy such as carlos 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:21.450
 of the rush and whatever else is a harmonica 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.970
 which presents various features 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.189
 before it comes to mind it is a diatonic 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.110
 and so far ok the second one that jumps into 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.939
 the look as you see it 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.860
 write this look a little bit 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:35.820
 fifty reminds me of those big cars 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:38.729
 Americans type of crisis that make it 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:41.520
 very pretty second thing is enough 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:43.170
 big you see now you don't have the 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.090
 comparison for another harmonic but is a 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.920
 grow bigger as if he had one 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:50.659
 sound box slightly larger 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.659
 this means that it has a large volume 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:00.359
 and just a great presence a great one 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:02.159
 very loud volume despite the 

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:04.409
 comm 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:06.210
 especially in the plastic, for example, 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:08.039
 with plastic but a slight sound 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:11.180
 more muffled more closed this is a 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:13.650
 cobras know each other very ringing 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:15.510
 big big big big volume comes 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.970
 used very much by those who 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:20.459
 they want to get out of a saturated microphone 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:22.230
 with a remarkable presence or that 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:24.269
 they play in acoustic then with a beautiful 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:27.870
 microphone from front forward voices 

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:29.700
 to the harmonica a good volume in these 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:32.420
 cases can only do this well 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:34.890
 harmonious the veil volume for sure 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.690
 other thing of the plastic congo 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.549
 we have already talked about it then besides 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:40.980
 be nice because red is a com 

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:45.060
 as I always say the bombs will survive 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:46.739
 totally indestructible thermonuclear 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.410
 totally water repellent and not yes 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:51.870
 deform the ance can happen nothing 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:54.660
 they are classic brass and 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:56.970
 i am very very very very very very very much 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:03:00.359
 very comfortable to the point that this 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:02.489
 harmonica before the advent of harmonics 

00:03:00.359 --> 00:03:04.590
 which perhaps are even still that 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:06.450
 designed for these techniques but first 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:10.829
 of the advent of harmonics as loughner 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:13.799
 crossover or suzuki eat was and is 

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:15.510
 still very much suggested is indicated 

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:18.150
 by those who know how to do them 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:21.180
 not me to run to learn a 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:22.859
 do to play over 20 our lady 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:24.860
 that with the over bening has cleared the 

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:26.420
 harmonica world creating all 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:28.160
 a number of possibilities saying ho 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:29.750
 seen the harmonica wanting it can become 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:32.420
 a diatonic wanting can become one 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:34.250
 chromatic has always pushed a lot in 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:39.050
 his methods speak very well of the 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:40.580
 golden melodies so what to say is 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:42.650
 a harmonica that probably already 

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:44.660
 you know xkÃ¨ really famous here we are 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:46.370
 at the levels of fame like the marin bands 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:47.750
 common species at 20 we are on those 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:49.160
 levels and a harmonica really is there 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:51.110
 long been produced and it really is 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:51.980
 very much used very much appreciated 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:53.930
