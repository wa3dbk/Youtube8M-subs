we have expanded our AI family by quite
a<00:01:48.759> bit<00:01:48.939> there's<00:01:49.450> lots<00:01:50.079> of<00:01:50.170> different<00:01:50.439> creature

00:01:50.669 --> 00:01:50.679 
a bit there's lots of different creature

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:52.529 
a bit there's lots of different creature
types<00:01:50.920> and<00:01:51.310> there's<00:01:51.700> lots<00:01:51.850> of<00:01:51.939> new<00:01:52.090> ways<00:01:52.299> that

00:01:52.529 --> 00:01:52.539 
types and there's lots of new ways that

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:54.149 
types and there's lots of new ways that
they<00:01:52.630> do<00:01:52.689> the<00:01:53.079> creature<00:01:53.500> types<00:01:53.710> interact<00:01:54.039> with

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:54.159 
they do the creature types interact with

they do the creature types interact with
each<00:01:54.280> other<00:01:54.429> for<00:01:55.390> example<00:01:55.720> there's<00:01:55.960> a<00:01:56.049> new<00:01:56.229> guy

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:56.409 
each other for example there's a new guy

00:01:56.409 --> 00:01:58.109 
each other for example there's a new guy
called<00:01:56.740> the<00:01:56.860> Kansas<00:01:57.280> and<00:01:57.369> have<00:01:57.610> the<00:01:58.030> ability

00:01:58.109 --> 00:01:58.119 
called the Kansas and have the ability

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:01.859

evolve because of the mechanics of it we
came<00:03:34.239> up<00:03:34.389> with<00:03:34.480> this<00:03:34.599> idea<00:03:34.780> to<00:03:35.170> kind<00:03:35.379> of<00:03:35.440> have

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.590 
came up with this idea to kind of have

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:37.470 
came up with this idea to kind of have
it<00:03:35.769> where<00:03:35.920> he's<00:03:36.099> walking<00:03:36.310> on<00:03:36.609> his<00:03:36.760> arms<00:03:37.120> and

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:37.480 
it where he's walking on his arms and

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.240 
it where he's walking on his arms and
his<00:03:37.569> body<00:03:37.629> kind<00:03:38.139> of<00:03:38.170> wraps<00:03:38.409> up<00:03:38.590> underneath<00:03:38.889> and

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:39.250 
his body kind of wraps up underneath and

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:41.490 
his body kind of wraps up underneath and
it's<00:03:39.400> is<00:03:39.639> it's<00:03:40.450> his<00:03:40.540> feet<00:03:40.870> that<00:03:41.170> are<00:03:41.260> kind<00:03:41.439> of

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:41.500 
it's is it's his feet that are kind of

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:42.809 
it's is it's his feet that are kind of

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:20.350 
I'd say scourge probably lays awake at
night<00:05:18.980> thinking<00:05:19.280> about<00:05:19.430> ways<00:05:19.700> to<00:05:19.970> hack<00:05:20.120> people

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:20.360 
night thinking about ways to hack people

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:23.860 
night thinking about ways to hack people
apart<00:05:20.780> and<00:05:21.020> separate<00:05:21.620> this<00:05:22.430> rail<00:05:22.700> scourge<00:05:23.690> and

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:23.870 
apart and separate this rail scourge and

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:25.900 
apart and separate this rail scourge and
eat<00:05:23.960> ramen<00:05:24.140> for<00:05:24.290> breakfast<00:05:24.740> basically<00:05:25.310> yeah<00:05:25.640> I

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:25.910 
eat ramen for breakfast basically yeah I

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:28.900 
eat ramen for breakfast basically yeah I
think<00:05:26.300> if<00:05:26.390> you<00:05:26.480> were<00:05:26.570> to<00:05:26.600> compare<00:05:27.340> ROM<00:05:28.340> to

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:28.910 
think if you were to compare ROM to

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:31.210 
think if you were to compare ROM to
scourge<00:05:29.540> these<00:05:29.930> cars<00:05:30.260> as<00:05:30.530> an<00:05:30.650> example<00:05:30.950> I<00:05:31.160> think

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:31.220 
scourge these cars as an example I think

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:32.980 
scourge these cars as an example I think
Rob<00:05:31.550> would<00:05:31.580> be<00:05:31.820> the<00:05:31.910> Humvee<00:05:32.300> where<00:05:32.630> scourge

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:32.990 
Rob would be the Humvee where scourge

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:35.660 
Rob would be the Humvee where scourge
would<00:05:33.200> be<00:05:33.320> the<00:05:33.440> Duke

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:35.670 

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:39.810 

it's<00:05:36.670> a<00:05:36.760> steak<00:05:37.090> versus<00:05:37.630> foie<00:05:37.990> gras<00:05:38.820> its

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:39.820 
it's a steak versus foie gras its

00:05:39.820 --> 00:06:02.410 
it's a steak versus foie gras its
flip-flops<00:05:40.510> versus<00:05:41.020> boots<00:05:41.800> I<00:05:42.160> can<00:05:43.060> go

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:02.420 

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:04.480
