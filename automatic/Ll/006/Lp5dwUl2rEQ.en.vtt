while my sheep know you clicked on shoot

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.909 
while my sheep know you clicked on shoot
that<00:00:03.899> one<00:00:04.140> beginning<00:00:05.069> oh<00:00:06.529> you<00:00:07.529> got<00:00:07.649> the<00:00:07.740> whole

00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:07.919 
that one beginning oh you got the whole

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:19.120 
that one beginning oh you got the whole
we've<00:00:08.429> got<00:00:08.610> me<00:00:09.980> pretend<00:00:10.980> oh<00:00:11.160> oh<00:00:14.000> god

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:19.130 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:21.849 

again<00:00:19.910> if<00:00:20.210> it's<00:00:20.480> not<00:00:20.630> if<00:00:21.320> it's<00:00:21.439> not<00:00:21.679> between

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:21.859 
again if it's not if it's not between

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:24.069 
again if it's not if it's not between
like<00:00:22.369> Venus<00:00:22.759> or<00:00:22.910> and<00:00:23.119> you<00:00:23.300> I<00:00:23.329> don't<00:00:23.750> know<00:00:23.869> what

00:00:24.069 --> 00:00:24.079 
like Venus or and you I don't know what

00:00:24.079 --> 00:00:26.229 
like Venus or and you I don't know what
it<00:00:24.169> is<00:00:24.199> well<00:00:24.919> I<00:00:24.949> just<00:00:25.340> tired<00:00:25.789> I<00:00:25.910> think<00:00:25.939> they

00:00:26.229 --> 00:00:26.239 
it is well I just tired I think they

00:00:26.239 --> 00:00:28.179 
it is well I just tired I think they
might<00:00:26.419> flip<00:00:26.599> over<00:00:26.900> in<00:00:26.989> the<00:00:27.109> entire<00:00:27.320> stage<00:00:27.649> well

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:28.189 
might flip over in the entire stage well

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:31.810 
might flip over in the entire stage well
yeah<00:00:28.279> I<00:00:28.309> figured<00:00:28.460> that<00:00:28.730> out<00:00:28.849> eventually<00:00:30.820> why

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:31.820 
yeah I figured that out eventually why

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:33.970 
yeah I figured that out eventually why
you<00:00:31.880> need<00:00:32.090> a<00:00:32.119> memory<00:00:32.710> apparently<00:00:33.710> I<00:00:33.739> might

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:33.980 
you need a memory apparently I might

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:35.110 
you need a memory apparently I might
actually<00:00:34.129> be<00:00:34.399> out<00:00:34.489> of<00:00:34.519> memory<00:00:34.760> which<00:00:34.850> I<00:00:35.059> don't

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:35.120 
actually be out of memory which I don't

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:36.850 
actually be out of memory which I don't
understand<00:00:35.629> because<00:00:35.839> these<00:00:36.350> things<00:00:36.589> aren't
