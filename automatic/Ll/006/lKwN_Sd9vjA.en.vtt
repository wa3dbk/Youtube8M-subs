between those two concrete like concrete
blocks<00:02:06.479> and<00:02:06.840> then<00:02:07.229> get<00:02:07.710> a<00:02:07.740> perfect<00:02:08.220> checkpoint

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
blocks and then get a perfect checkpoint

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.150 
blocks and then get a perfect checkpoint
so<00:02:08.759> that<00:02:08.910> checkpoint<00:02:09.090> goes<00:02:09.420> right<00:02:09.840> as<00:02:10.080> soon<00:02:10.950> as

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
so that checkpoint goes right as soon as

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.900

okay so when we get here fine tuning you
want<00:04:08.760> to<00:04:08.820> go<00:04:08.910> to<00:04:08.970> bipeds<00:04:09.540> and<00:04:11.180> click<00:04:12.180> the

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:12.360

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:19.020 
all the players or AI in the map or the

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:22.160 
all the players or AI in the map or the
checkpoint<00:04:19.590> loading<00:04:20.010> area<00:04:20.310> you<00:04:20.970> have<00:04:21.209> so<00:04:21.600> what

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:22.170 
checkpoint loading area you have so what

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:25.250 
checkpoint loading area you have so what
you<00:04:22.290> want<00:04:22.470> to<00:04:22.560> do<00:04:22.740> is<00:04:23.630> click<00:04:24.630> on<00:04:24.780> every<00:04:25.080> single

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:25.260 
you want to do is click on every single

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.770 
you want to do is click on every single
enemy<00:04:25.770> don't<00:04:26.070> do<00:04:26.640> the<00:04:26.820> Marines<00:04:27.180> and<00:04:27.420> don't<00:04:27.630> do

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:27.780 
enemy don't do the Marines and don't do

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:29.990 
enemy don't do the Marines and don't do
cat<00:04:28.050> just<00:04:28.320> only<00:04:28.680> enemies<00:04:29.040> like<00:04:29.220> jackals<00:04:29.700> and

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.000 
cat just only enemies like jackals and

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.170 
cat just only enemies like jackals and
elites<00:04:30.390> and<00:04:30.600> make<00:04:30.870> the<00:04:31.460> coordinates<00:04:32.460> the<00:04:32.670> X<00:04:32.880> it

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:33.180 
elites and make the coordinates the X it

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:36.290 
elites and make the coordinates the X it
should<00:04:33.210> be<00:04:33.540> negative<00:04:33.960> 66<00:04:34.530> y<00:04:34.920> should<00:04:35.190> be<00:04:35.430> 55<00:04:36.030> and

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:36.300 
should be negative 66 y should be 55 and

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:40.030 
should be negative 66 y should be 55 and
Zed<00:04:37.050> should<00:04:37.260> be<00:04:37.380> fifteen<00:04:38.010> point<00:04:38.310> eight<00:04:38.520> six

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:40.040 
Zed should be fifteen point eight six

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:42.490 
Zed should be fifteen point eight six
those<00:04:41.040> coordinates<00:04:41.520> are<00:04:41.580> the<00:04:41.640> best<00:04:41.910> because

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:42.500 
those coordinates are the best because

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:45.770 
those coordinates are the best because
where<00:04:43.500> you<00:04:43.620> aim<00:04:43.860> where<00:04:44.370> I<00:04:44.400> aim<00:04:44.910> that<00:04:45.240> would<00:04:45.450> be

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:45.780 
where you aim where I aim that would be

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:49.190 
where you aim where I aim that would be
a<00:04:45.810> definite<00:04:46.260> hit<00:04:46.500> and<00:04:47.030> I<00:04:48.030> don't<00:04:48.900> know<00:04:49.050> it's

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:49.200 
a definite hit and I don't know it's

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:51.620 
a definite hit and I don't know it's
just<00:04:49.380> better<00:04:49.620> easiest<00:04:50.580> place<00:04:50.850> to<00:04:51.090> put<00:04:51.540> the

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:51.630 
just better easiest place to put the

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:53.480 
just better easiest place to put the
enemies<00:04:51.930> so<00:04:52.590> I<00:04:52.620> just<00:04:52.890> do<00:04:53.010> that<00:04:53.160> to<00:04:53.280> every

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:53.490 
enemies so I just do that to every

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:55.570 
enemies so I just do that to every
single<00:04:53.640> enemy<00:04:54.060> it<00:04:54.180> takes<00:04:54.390> about<00:04:54.570> probably

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:55.580 
single enemy it takes about probably

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:58.190 
single enemy it takes about probably
three<00:04:56.580> or<00:04:56.670> seven<00:04:56.970> minutes<00:04:57.270> to<00:04:57.360> do<00:04:57.480> it<00:04:57.660> takes<00:04:58.110> a

00:04:58.190 --> 00:04:58.200 
three or seven minutes to do it takes a

00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:59.450 
three or seven minutes to do it takes a
little<00:04:58.350> while<00:04:58.560> because<00:04:58.800> there's<00:04:59.250> so<00:04:59.370> many

00:04:59.450 --> 00:04:59.460 
little while because there's so many

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:04.400 
little while because there's so many
enemies<00:04:59.700> on<00:05:00.150> the<00:05:00.420> load<00:05:01.260> zone<00:05:01.290> and<00:05:02.100> then<00:05:03.090> um<00:05:03.420> so

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:04.410 
enemies on the load zone and then um so

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:07.280 
enemies on the load zone and then um so
I'm<00:05:04.830> on<00:05:05.160> my<00:05:05.190> last<00:05:05.970> enemy<00:05:06.570> right<00:05:06.780> here<00:05:07.110> I
