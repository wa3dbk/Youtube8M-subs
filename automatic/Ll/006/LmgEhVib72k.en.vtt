I<00:00:21.750> want<00:00:21.960> you<00:00:22.020> to<00:00:22.140> consider<00:00:22.500> for<00:00:22.740> a<00:00:22.769> minute<00:00:22.980> the

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
I want you to consider for a minute the

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.779 
I want you to consider for a minute the
two<00:00:23.130> laws<00:00:23.970> of<00:00:24.390> playing<00:00:25.140> winning<00:00:25.800> tennis<00:00:26.369> and

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
two laws of playing winning tennis and

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.109 
two laws of playing winning tennis and
they<00:00:27.180> are<00:00:27.300> one<00:00:27.689> get<00:00:28.380> the<00:00:28.500> ball<00:00:28.710> in<00:00:28.890> play<00:00:29.130> and<00:00:29.369> to

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
they are one get the ball in play and to

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.780 
they are one get the ball in play and to
always<00:00:30.900> be<00:00:31.109> ready<00:00:31.380> for<00:00:31.800> the<00:00:31.890> next<00:00:32.160> ball<00:00:32.520> to

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
always be ready for the next ball to

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.299 
always be ready for the next ball to
come<00:00:33.030> back<00:00:33.270> so<00:00:34.200> let<00:00:34.320> me<00:00:34.410> rephrase<00:00:34.860> those<00:00:35.070> laws

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
come back so let me rephrase those laws

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.250 
come back so let me rephrase those laws
far<00:00:35.940> too<00:00:36.149> many<00:00:36.329> players<00:00:36.570> tend<00:00:36.960> to<00:00:37.050> lose

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
far too many players tend to lose

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.310 
far too many players tend to lose
because<00:00:37.770> of<00:00:37.890> errors<00:00:38.190> or<00:00:38.730> from<00:00:39.660> failing<00:00:40.079> to<00:00:40.230> get

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
because of errors or from failing to get

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.220 
because of errors or from failing to get
ready<00:00:40.559> for<00:00:40.739> the<00:00:40.800> next<00:00:40.980> shot<00:00:41.070> so<00:00:42.030> let's<00:00:42.719> assume

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
ready for the next shot so let's assume

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.500 
ready for the next shot so let's assume
it's<00:00:43.980> go<00:00:44.129> forward<00:00:44.489> a<00:00:44.550> bit<00:00:44.730> and<00:00:44.910> let's<00:00:45.180> assume

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
it's go forward a bit and let's assume

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.569 
it's go forward a bit and let's assume
that<00:00:45.660> you<00:00:45.840> were<00:00:45.930> actually<00:00:46.050> able<00:00:46.500> to<00:00:46.770> reduce

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
that you were actually able to reduce

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.490 
that you were actually able to reduce
the<00:00:47.789> errors<00:00:48.030> you<00:00:48.059> were<00:00:48.210> making<00:00:48.570> and<00:00:48.750> also<00:00:49.440> you

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
the errors you were making and also you

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.380 
the errors you were making and also you
actually<00:00:49.920> were<00:00:50.039> more<00:00:50.250> prepared<00:00:50.610> and<00:00:50.879> better

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
actually were more prepared and better

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:52.910 
actually were more prepared and better
prepared<00:00:51.809> for<00:00:51.870> any<00:00:52.170> balls<00:00:52.440> that<00:00:52.590> were<00:00:52.710> coming

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
prepared for any balls that were coming

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.310 
prepared for any balls that were coming
back<00:00:53.160> now<00:00:54.000> assuming<00:00:54.809> you<00:00:54.960> were<00:00:55.050> playing

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
back now assuming you were playing

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.500 
back now assuming you were playing
pliers<00:00:55.680> that<00:00:56.219> have<00:00:56.340> also<00:00:56.640> done<00:00:57.000> a<00:00:57.059> similar

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
pliers that have also done a similar

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.270 
pliers that have also done a similar
drop<00:00:57.960> to<00:00:58.170> their<00:00:58.320> game<00:00:58.530> when<00:00:58.949> we<00:00:59.070> look<00:00:59.190> at

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
drop to their game when we look at

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.729 
drop to their game when we look at
winning<00:00:59.670> that<00:00:59.820> then<00:01:00.449> becomes<00:01:00.930> down<00:01:01.530> to<00:01:01.710> a

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
winning that then becomes down to a

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.640 
winning that then becomes down to a
matter<00:01:02.010> of<00:01:02.250> strategy<00:01:02.609> and<00:01:03.650> successfully

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
matter of strategy and successfully

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.020 
matter of strategy and successfully
employing<00:01:05.070> tactics<00:01:05.810> it<00:01:06.810> all<00:01:06.960> becomes<00:01:07.380> about

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:08.030 
employing tactics it all becomes about

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:11.289 
employing tactics it all becomes about
creating<00:01:09.030> and<00:01:09.360> hitting<00:01:09.780> into<00:01:09.990> space<00:01:10.439> and

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:11.299 
creating and hitting into space and

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:14.000 
creating and hitting into space and
using<00:01:12.299> angles<00:01:12.810> and<00:01:13.080> changing<00:01:13.590> the<00:01:13.830> whole

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
using angles and changing the whole

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.399 
using angles and changing the whole
dynamics<00:01:14.520> of<00:01:14.760> things<00:01:15.090> like<00:01:15.299> depth<00:01:15.630> and<00:01:15.930> speed

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
dynamics of things like depth and speed

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.850 
dynamics of things like depth and speed
and<00:01:16.979> spin<00:01:17.640> and<00:01:17.939> height<00:01:18.180> etc<00:01:18.780> so<00:01:19.530> with<00:01:19.710> that

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
and spin and height etc so with that

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.130 
and spin and height etc so with that
being<00:01:20.040> said<00:01:20.130> here<00:01:20.939> are<00:01:20.970> two<00:01:21.270> factors<00:01:21.689> you<00:01:21.840> may

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
being said here are two factors you may

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.590 
being said here are two factors you may
not<00:01:22.409> considered<00:01:23.100> that<00:01:23.549> may<00:01:23.880> actually<00:01:24.390> now

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
not considered that may actually now

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.260 
not considered that may actually now

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
prompt you to working on adding the drop

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.510 
prompt you to working on adding the drop

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
shot - your tennis toolkit now I want

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:30.980 
shot - your tennis toolkit now I want
you<00:01:29.579> to<00:01:29.670> think<00:01:29.790> about<00:01:29.909> it<00:01:30.150> if<00:01:30.240> you<00:01:30.329> noticed<00:01:30.810> how

you to think about it if you noticed how

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.679 
you to think about it if you noticed how

much Djokovic Murray Federer and Nadal
now<00:01:34.470> all<00:01:34.799> play<00:01:35.220> the<00:01:35.369> drop<00:01:35.579> shot<00:01:35.790> on<00:01:36.030> a<00:01:36.119> much

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
now all play the drop shot on a much

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.140 
now all play the drop shot on a much
more<00:01:36.869> regular<00:01:37.110> Basin<00:01:38.070> they<00:01:38.159> used<00:01:38.369> to<00:01:38.549> okay<00:01:39.090> so

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
more regular Basin they used to okay so

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.149 
more regular Basin they used to okay so
let's<00:01:39.390> get<00:01:39.509> into<00:01:39.750> it<00:01:39.780> now<00:01:40.020> factor<00:01:40.680> one<00:01:40.890> our

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
let's get into it now factor one our

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.520 
let's get into it now factor one our
tennis<00:01:41.820> court<00:01:42.150> dimensions<00:01:42.750> and<00:01:43.170> if<00:01:43.259> we<00:01:43.380> look

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
tennis court dimensions and if we look

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.370 
tennis court dimensions and if we look
at<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:43.710> singles<00:01:44.130> court<00:01:44.399> its<00:01:45.000> 27<00:01:45.930> feet<00:01:46.140> wide

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
at the singles court its 27 feet wide

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.990 
at the singles court its 27 feet wide
and<00:01:46.740> it's<00:01:47.159> 78<00:01:48.000> feet<00:01:48.479> deep<00:01:49.049> end<00:01:49.380> to<00:01:49.530> end<00:01:49.860> now<00:01:50.640> if

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
and it's 78 feet deep end to end now if

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.850 
and it's 78 feet deep end to end now if
you<00:01:51.270> just<00:01:51.509> run<00:01:51.720> your<00:01:52.110> opponent<00:01:52.680> from<00:01:52.740> the

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
you just run your opponent from the

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.179 
you just run your opponent from the
center<00:01:53.460> out<00:01:54.119> to<00:01:54.180> say<00:01:54.899> one<00:01:55.619> of<00:01:55.740> the<00:01:55.829> singles

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
center out to say one of the singles

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:57.789 
center out to say one of the singles
sidelines<00:01:56.640> then<00:01:57.210> we're<00:01:57.360> looking<00:01:57.450> at<00:01:57.659> about

00:01:57.789 --> 00:01:57.799 
sidelines then we're looking at about

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:00.770 
sidelines then we're looking at about
thirteen<00:01:58.799> and<00:01:58.979> a<00:01:59.040> half<00:01:59.070> feet<00:01:59.490> if<00:02:00.360> I<00:02:00.570> was<00:02:00.689> to

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
thirteen and a half feet if I was to

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.450 
thirteen and a half feet if I was to
actually<00:02:00.899> hit<00:02:01.259> two<00:02:01.649> shots<00:02:01.680> and<00:02:02.189> hit<00:02:02.310> them

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
actually hit two shots and hit them

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.520 
actually hit two shots and hit them
corner-to-corner<00:02:03.180> so<00:02:03.810> they<00:02:03.930> run<00:02:04.140> from<00:02:04.290> one

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
corner-to-corner so they run from one

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.679 
corner-to-corner so they run from one
side<00:02:04.799> and<00:02:04.829> then<00:02:05.159> to<00:02:05.340> the<00:02:05.369> other<00:02:05.509> then<00:02:06.509> we're

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
side and then to the other then we're

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:10.339 
side and then to the other then we're
looking<00:02:06.780> at<00:02:07.170> 27<00:02:08.099> feet<00:02:08.310> roughly<00:02:08.899> if<00:02:09.899> I<00:02:10.080> was<00:02:10.229> to

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
looking at 27 feet roughly if I was to

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.920 
looking at 27 feet roughly if I was to
run<00:02:10.500> my<00:02:10.709> opponent<00:02:11.250> from<00:02:11.640> the<00:02:11.730> baseline<00:02:12.360> to<00:02:12.750> the

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
run my opponent from the baseline to the

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:13.260 
run my opponent from the baseline to the
net

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
net

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:15.450 
net
with<00:02:13.660> let's<00:02:13.900> just<00:02:14.170> say<00:02:14.320> an<00:02:14.380> average<00:02:14.650> drop<00:02:15.250> shot

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:15.460 
with let's just say an average drop shot

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:18.600 
with let's just say an average drop shot
then<00:02:15.970> we're<00:02:16.150> looking<00:02:16.240> at<00:02:16.540> about<00:02:16.960> 30<00:02:17.800> foot<00:02:18.100> if<00:02:18.490> I

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
then we're looking at about 30 foot if I

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:20.880 
then we're looking at about 30 foot if I
was<00:02:18.730> to<00:02:18.850> run<00:02:19.030> my<00:02:19.180> opponent<00:02:19.630> from<00:02:20.170> way<00:02:20.650> behind

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
was to run my opponent from way behind

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.280 
was to run my opponent from way behind
the<00:02:21.250> base<00:02:21.430> line<00:02:21.700> all<00:02:22.420> the<00:02:22.690> way<00:02:22.720> up<00:02:22.870> to<00:02:23.020> the<00:02:23.110> net

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
the base line all the way up to the net

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.080 
the base line all the way up to the net
with<00:02:23.410> a<00:02:23.440> good<00:02:23.680> drop<00:02:23.920> shot<00:02:23.950> then<00:02:24.610> we're<00:02:24.760> looking

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
with a good drop shot then we're looking

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:29.670 
with a good drop shot then we're looking
in<00:02:25.300> excess<00:02:25.840> of<00:02:26.170> 35<00:02:27.360> feet<00:02:28.360> plus<00:02:28.630> so<00:02:29.230> can<00:02:29.380> you<00:02:29.470> see

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
in excess of 35 feet plus so can you see

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.920 
in excess of 35 feet plus so can you see
how<00:02:29.710> the<00:02:30.670> actual<00:02:30.940> geometry<00:02:31.150> of<00:02:31.420> the<00:02:31.540> court<00:02:31.810> and

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
how the actual geometry of the court and

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:34.320 
how the actual geometry of the court and
the<00:02:31.990> distance<00:02:32.440> is<00:02:32.620> involved<00:02:33.160> actually<00:02:33.880> begin

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330 
the distance is involved actually begin

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:35.700 
the distance is involved actually begin
to<00:02:34.360> work<00:02:34.780> in<00:02:34.990> your<00:02:35.140> favor

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:35.710 
to work in your favor

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:37.860 
to work in your favor
but<00:02:36.010> let's<00:02:36.160> just<00:02:36.310> add<00:02:36.550> one<00:02:37.150> more<00:02:37.330> thing<00:02:37.570> on<00:02:37.660> to

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
but let's just add one more thing on to

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:40.140 
but let's just add one more thing on to
that<00:02:38.050> and<00:02:38.530> we'll<00:02:38.650> factor<00:02:38.860> 2<00:02:39.310> is<00:02:39.790> all<00:02:40.120> about

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
that and we'll factor 2 is all about

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:43.050 
that and we'll factor 2 is all about
what<00:02:40.990> players<00:02:41.350> normally<00:02:41.830> do<00:02:42.280> in<00:02:42.760> their

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
what players normally do in their

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:46.080 
what players normally do in their
practice<00:02:43.540> because<00:02:44.500> most<00:02:44.800> players<00:02:44.980> tend<00:02:45.970> to

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
practice because most players tend to

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:47.310 
practice because most players tend to
practice<00:02:46.450> their<00:02:46.630> groundstrokes

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:47.320 
practice their groundstrokes

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:49.800 
practice their groundstrokes
they<00:02:47.650> overlook<00:02:48.310> things<00:02:48.880> like<00:02:49.060> approach<00:02:49.450> shots

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
they overlook things like approach shots

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:51.840 
they overlook things like approach shots
and<00:02:50.050> volleys<00:02:50.380> and<00:02:50.410> overheads<00:02:50.950> and<00:02:51.130> even<00:02:51.760> if

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:51.850 
and volleys and overheads and even if

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:53.730 
and volleys and overheads and even if
they<00:02:52.000> do<00:02:52.060> work<00:02:52.570> on<00:02:52.780> their<00:02:52.930> net<00:02:53.080> game<00:02:53.320> they

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:53.740 
they do work on their net game they

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:56.250 
they do work on their net game they
normally<00:02:54.190> work<00:02:54.310> on<00:02:54.550> it<00:02:54.700> in<00:02:55.060> isolation<00:02:55.960> you

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 
normally work on it in isolation you

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:57.870 
normally work on it in isolation you
know<00:02:56.350> they<00:02:56.470> stand<00:02:56.740> at<00:02:56.860> the<00:02:56.950> net<00:02:57.160> take<00:02:57.670> some

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:57.880 
know they stand at the net take some

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:00.000 
know they stand at the net take some
volleys<00:02:58.180> they<00:02:58.540> don't<00:02:58.840> involve<00:02:59.230> the<00:02:59.470> movement

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
volleys they don't involve the movement

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.190 
volleys they don't involve the movement
to<00:03:00.280> the<00:03:00.400> ball<00:03:00.610> big<00:03:01.090> mistake<00:03:01.540> and<00:03:01.780> something

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
to the ball big mistake and something

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.980 
to the ball big mistake and something
you<00:03:02.530> should<00:03:03.040> be<00:03:03.130> looking<00:03:03.250> to<00:03:03.520> exploit<00:03:03.940> so<00:03:04.630> if

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:04.990 
you should be looking to exploit so if

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:06.960 
you should be looking to exploit so if
your<00:03:05.260> tactics<00:03:05.770> think<00:03:05.980> about<00:03:06.220> it<00:03:06.460> or<00:03:06.610> to<00:03:06.820> move

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:06.970 
your tactics think about it or to move

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:09.510 
your tactics think about it or to move
your<00:03:07.180> opponent's<00:03:07.630> from<00:03:07.690> side<00:03:08.050> to<00:03:08.080> side<00:03:08.520> isn't

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:09.520 
your opponent's from side to side isn't

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:10.650 
your opponent's from side to side isn't
this<00:03:09.640> just<00:03:09.940> something<00:03:10.390> that<00:03:10.420> they<00:03:10.630> probably

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:10.660 
this just something that they probably

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:12.450 
this just something that they probably
do<00:03:11.110> a<00:03:11.140> lot<00:03:11.290> anyway<00:03:11.710> when<00:03:12.070> they're<00:03:12.250> practicing

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:12.460 
do a lot anyway when they're practicing

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:15.450 
do a lot anyway when they're practicing
so<00:03:13.240> what<00:03:13.420> if<00:03:13.540> you<00:03:13.720> changed<00:03:14.200> your<00:03:14.470> tactics<00:03:14.980> to

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:15.460 
so what if you changed your tactics to

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:18.510 
so what if you changed your tactics to
now<00:03:15.700> include<00:03:16.330> going<00:03:17.140> from<00:03:17.470> deep<00:03:17.740> to<00:03:17.950> short<00:03:18.250> and

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:18.520 
now include going from deep to short and

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:20.580 
now include going from deep to short and
not<00:03:18.670> just<00:03:18.970> sticking<00:03:19.210> side<00:03:19.600> to<00:03:19.780> side<00:03:19.990> would<00:03:20.560> you

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
not just sticking side to side would you

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:22.110 
not just sticking side to side would you
not<00:03:20.980> be<00:03:21.130> getting<00:03:21.370> your<00:03:21.490> opponent<00:03:21.910> into

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.120 
not be getting your opponent into

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.360 
not be getting your opponent into
somewhat<00:03:22.600> of<00:03:22.630> an<00:03:23.110> uncharted<00:03:23.740> area<00:03:24.160> of<00:03:24.280> the

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370 
somewhat of an uncharted area of the

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:25.710 
somewhat of an uncharted area of the
court<00:03:24.640> something<00:03:25.150> they<00:03:25.330> haven't<00:03:25.570> been

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:25.720 
court something they haven't been

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.660 
court something they haven't been
practicing<00:03:26.200> a<00:03:26.260> lot<00:03:26.410> well<00:03:27.010> I<00:03:27.040> think<00:03:27.190> you<00:03:27.460> would

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:27.670 
practicing a lot well I think you would

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:31.050 
practicing a lot well I think you would
so<00:03:28.300> if<00:03:28.600> your<00:03:28.840> opponent<00:03:29.380> prefers<00:03:29.800> or<00:03:30.520> is<00:03:30.700> used

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.060 
so if your opponent prefers or is used

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:33.000 
so if your opponent prefers or is used
to<00:03:31.210> operating<00:03:31.630> side<00:03:32.410> to<00:03:32.560> side<00:03:32.770> at<00:03:32.950> the

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.010 
to operating side to side at the

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:35.280 
to operating side to side at the
baseline<00:03:33.340> doesn't<00:03:34.240> it<00:03:34.300> now<00:03:34.510> make<00:03:34.750> sense<00:03:34.990> to

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290 
baseline doesn't it now make sense to

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:36.870 
baseline doesn't it now make sense to

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:36.880 
think about moving them forward from

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:38.640 
think about moving them forward from
time<00:03:37.060> to<00:03:37.210> time<00:03:37.240> I<00:03:37.600> witnessed<00:03:38.170> Andy<00:03:38.470> Murray

using this tactic as a kid and more

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:45.960 
using this tactic as a kid and more
importantly<00:03:44.830> this<00:03:44.920> can<00:03:45.190> work<00:03:45.370> wonders<00:03:45.760> for
