00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:39.390 
I can go down here just look at this and
that's<00:03:36.970> that<00:03:37.120> all<00:03:37.269> the<00:03:37.690> gamma<00:03:37.959> is<00:03:38.260> up<00:03:38.470> so<00:03:39.100> you

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:39.400 
that's that all the gamma is up so you

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.030 
that's that all the gamma is up so you
know<00:03:39.489> what<00:03:39.640> let's<00:03:39.820> not<00:03:39.970> mess<00:03:40.150> with<00:03:40.180> this<00:03:40.420> cave

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
know what let's not mess with this cave

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.830 
know what let's not mess with this cave
and<00:03:42.040> that's<00:03:42.310> like<00:03:42.670> all<00:03:42.910> my<00:03:43.030> call<00:03:43.330> the<00:03:43.480> gamma<00:03:43.660> is

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:43.840 
and that's like all my call the gamma is

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:45.720 
and that's like all my call the gamma is
up<00:03:44.049> so<00:03:44.200> let's<00:03:44.350> just<00:03:44.530> walk<00:03:44.680> around<00:03:44.830> in<00:03:45.130> it<00:03:45.280> since

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:45.730 
up so let's just walk around in it since

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:49.890 
up so let's just walk around in it since
um<00:03:47.220> let's<00:03:48.220> just<00:03:48.310> walk<00:03:48.580> around<00:03:48.730> since<00:03:49.390> we<00:03:49.660> can't

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:49.900 
um let's just walk around since we can't

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:54.180 
um let's just walk around since we can't
really<00:03:50.080> go<00:03:50.230> down<00:03:50.410> there<00:03:50.650> um<00:03:51.400> so<00:03:52.299> yeah<00:03:53.190> the

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:19.230 
like that and I know there's there's

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:21.199 
like that and I know there's there's
there's<00:04:19.350> only<00:04:19.709> one<00:04:20.040> biome<00:04:20.430> the<00:04:20.700> two<00:04:20.880> bottoms

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:21.209 
there's only one biome the two bottoms

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:23.470 
there's only one biome the two bottoms
both<00:04:21.540> three<00:04:22.109> actually<00:04:22.530> the<00:04:22.650> water<00:04:22.860> by<00:04:23.100> them

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:23.480 
both three actually the water by them

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:26.420 
both three actually the water by them
the<00:04:24.480> regular<00:04:25.200> grass<00:04:25.410> biome<00:04:25.800> and<00:04:25.830> there's<00:04:26.220> the

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430 
the regular grass biome and there's the

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:29.150 
the regular grass biome and there's the
desert<00:04:26.970> I<00:04:27.060> think<00:04:27.270> there's<00:04:27.389> a<00:04:27.450> desert<00:04:28.160> solutely

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:29.160 
desert I think there's a desert solutely

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:30.830 
desert I think there's a desert solutely
the<00:04:29.280> trees<00:04:29.550> look<00:04:29.820> really<00:04:30.150> different<00:04:30.300> than<00:04:30.600> the

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:30.840 
the trees look really different than the

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:34.159 
the trees look really different than the
car<00:04:31.050> like<00:04:31.320> look<00:04:32.310> how<00:04:32.460> green<00:04:32.820> the<00:04:32.880> look<00:04:33.270> is<00:04:34.110> a

00:04:34.159 --> 00:04:34.169 
car like look how green the look is a

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:39.200 
car like look how green the look is a
major<00:04:34.380> difference<00:04:35.960> um<00:04:37.520> let's<00:04:38.520> go<00:04:38.790> let's<00:04:39.120> go

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:39.210 
major difference um let's go let's go

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:41.210 
major difference um let's go let's go
back<00:04:39.450> over<00:04:39.660> here<00:04:39.990> let's<00:04:40.410> just<00:04:40.440> explore<00:04:40.800> around

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:41.220 
back over here let's just explore around

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:43.870 
back over here let's just explore around
oh<00:04:41.520> yeah<00:04:41.880> the<00:04:42.030> map<00:04:42.270> I<00:04:42.479> forgot<00:04:42.690> about<00:04:42.900> the<00:04:43.020> map<00:04:43.200> I

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:43.880 
oh yeah the map I forgot about the map I

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:46.040 
oh yeah the map I forgot about the map I
forgot<00:04:44.880> about<00:04:44.940> the<00:04:45.210> map<00:04:45.360> I<00:04:45.540> don't<00:04:45.840> think<00:04:45.990> you

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:46.050 
forgot about the map I don't think you

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:48.050 
forgot about the map I don't think you
can<00:04:46.139> put<00:04:46.320> on<00:04:46.410> a<00:04:46.440> skin<00:04:47.100> pack<00:04:47.340> either<00:04:47.610> hold<00:04:47.940> up

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:48.060 
can put on a skin pack either hold up

no<00:04:52.560> coordinates<00:04:52.979> I<00:04:53.340> just<00:04:54.300> noticed<00:04:54.570> that<00:04:54.600> too

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:55.550 
no coordinates I just noticed that too

00:04:55.550 --> 00:05:00.409 
no coordinates I just noticed that too
it's<00:04:56.550> just<00:04:56.760> pure<00:04:56.970> blank<00:04:57.380> Wow<00:04:58.490> crazy<00:04:59.490> huh<00:04:59.700> UK

00:05:00.409 --> 00:05:00.419 
it's just pure blank Wow crazy huh UK

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:04.219 
it's just pure blank Wow crazy huh UK
yeah<00:05:00.600> you<00:05:00.660> can't<00:05:01.020> put<00:05:01.229> on<00:05:01.320> a<00:05:01.350> skin<00:05:01.680> pack<00:05:03.229> can

00:05:04.219 --> 00:05:04.229 
yeah you can't put on a skin pack can

00:05:04.229 --> 00:05:07.370 
yeah you can't put on a skin pack can
you<00:05:05.510> reset<00:05:06.510> to<00:05:06.600> the<00:05:06.720> fold<00:05:06.960> so<00:05:07.139> I<00:05:07.169> don't<00:05:07.320> know

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:07.380 
you reset to the fold so I don't know

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:09.730 
you reset to the fold so I don't know
what<00:05:07.470> that<00:05:07.500> does<00:05:07.700> controls<00:05:08.700> I<00:05:09.000> think<00:05:09.210> setting
