back in there eventually but i got to
get<00:00:46.200> another<00:00:46.350> light<00:00:46.590> for<00:00:46.950> it<00:00:47.129> now<00:00:47.910> we<00:00:48.120> got<00:00:48.270> some

get another light for it now we got some
bubblers<00:00:48.870> going<00:00:49.230> on<00:00:49.379> here<00:00:49.680> now<00:00:50.210> just<00:00:51.210> to<00:00:51.390> move

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539

some<00:00:51.780> water<00:00:52.050> around<00:00:52.440> because<00:00:52.829> my<00:00:53.039> oxygen

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
some water around because my oxygen

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.160 
some water around because my oxygen
levels<00:00:53.910> I<00:00:54.030> think<00:00:54.270> we're<00:00:54.449> really<00:00:54.719> low<00:00:54.989> because

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
levels I think we're really low because

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.880 
levels I think we're really low because

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
so I got to get a new ballast and then

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.870 
so I got to get a new ballast and then
this<00:01:55.590> lid<00:01:55.890> this<00:01:56.850> lid<00:01:57.090> is<00:01:57.119> is<00:01:57.420> just<00:01:57.960> debt<00:01:58.500> so<00:01:59.430> I'm

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
this lid this lid is is just debt so I'm

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.609 
this lid this lid is is just debt so I'm
going<00:02:00.270> to<00:02:00.299> probably<00:02:00.840> make<00:02:01.290> one<00:02:01.469> out<00:02:01.500> of

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
going to probably make one out of

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.709 
going to probably make one out of
coroplast<00:02:02.250> or<00:02:02.610> something<00:02:02.969> with<00:02:03.180> some<00:02:03.479> meter

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
coroplast or something with some meter

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.620 
coroplast or something with some meter
sticks<00:02:04.110> for<00:02:04.409> ribs<00:02:04.649> in<00:02:04.890> it<00:02:05.009> to<00:02:05.939> put<00:02:06.420> some

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
sticks for ribs in it to put some

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.770 
sticks for ribs in it to put some
structural<00:02:07.170> integrity<00:02:07.590> there<00:02:08.479> then<00:02:09.479> we<00:02:09.629> got

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
structural integrity there then we got

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.920 
structural integrity there then we got
the<00:02:09.959> I<00:02:10.730> got<00:02:11.730> my<00:02:11.849> friggin<00:02:12.209> Raptor<00:02:12.599> I'll<00:02:12.720> ripped

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
the I got my friggin Raptor I'll ripped

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:13.650 
the I got my friggin Raptor I'll ripped
apart<00:02:13.080> rate

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
apart rate

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.100

what<00:02:44.860> happens<00:02:45.250> is<00:02:45.430> when<00:02:45.700> I<00:02:45.730> start<00:02:46.090> this<00:02:46.300> it's

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:46.570 
what happens is when I start this it's

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:48.230 
what happens is when I start this it's
it's<00:02:46.900> it<00:02:47.320> all<00:02:47.470> rotates<00:02:47.890> counterclockwise

it's it all rotates counterclockwise

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:51.210 
it's it all rotates counterclockwise

where<00:02:52.180> it's<00:02:52.300> you<00:02:52.420> know<00:02:52.510> stick<00:02:52.750> to<00:02:52.840> start<00:02:53.140> rim

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:53.380 
where it's you know stick to start rim

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:57.360 
where it's you know stick to start rim
and<00:02:53.790> the<00:02:54.790> engine<00:02:55.450> got<00:02:55.600> hydro<00:02:56.020> locked<00:02:56.290> so<00:02:57.280> it

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
and the engine got hydro locked so it

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:59.100 
and the engine got hydro locked so it
was<00:02:57.460> full<00:02:57.670> of<00:02:57.790> full<00:02:58.060> of<00:02:58.120> fuel<00:02:58.480> and<00:02:58.810> I<00:02:58.900> didn't

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110 
was full of full of fuel and I didn't

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:00.720 
was full of full of fuel and I didn't
realize<00:02:59.500> it<00:02:59.710> and<00:02:59.770> I<00:02:59.830> put<00:02:59.980> the<00:03:00.070> starter<00:03:00.340> on<00:03:00.580> and

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
realize it and I put the starter on and

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:03.870 
realize it and I put the starter on and
it's<00:03:00.820> unthreaded<00:03:01.750> this<00:03:02.050> up<00:03:02.380> and<00:03:02.880> jammed

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:03.880 
it's unthreaded this up and jammed

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:07.500 
it's unthreaded this up and jammed
jammed<00:03:04.840> the<00:03:05.110> clutch<00:03:05.380> here<00:03:06.000> into<00:03:07.000> into<00:03:07.480> the

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510 
jammed the clutch here into into the

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:09.660 
jammed the clutch here into into the
clutch<00:03:07.840> bell<00:03:08.170> and<00:03:08.590> everything<00:03:08.890> locked<00:03:09.130> up<00:03:09.370> and

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
clutch bell and everything locked up and

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:12.900 
clutch bell and everything locked up and
decided<00:03:10.420> to<00:03:10.570> rip<00:03:10.720> it<00:03:10.870> all<00:03:10.960> apart<00:03:11.230> and<00:03:11.640> my<00:03:12.640> old<00:03:12.820> r

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:12.910 
decided to rip it all apart and my old r

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:14.220 
decided to rip it all apart and my old r
after<00:03:13.150> i<00:03:13.180> could<00:03:13.270> just<00:03:13.420> take<00:03:13.600> up<00:03:13.750> four<00:03:13.960> bolts

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:14.230 
after i could just take up four bolts

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:15.630 
after i could just take up four bolts
and<00:03:14.380> the<00:03:14.470> engine<00:03:14.740> would<00:03:14.830> follow<00:03:15.040> this<00:03:15.340> one<00:03:15.550> the

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:15.640 
and the engine would follow this one the

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.160 
and the engine would follow this one the
landing<00:03:15.970> gears<00:03:16.150> got<00:03:16.360> to<00:03:16.480> come<00:03:16.600> off<00:03:16.630> and

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.170 
landing gears got to come off and

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:19.410 
landing gears got to come off and
there's<00:03:18.010> this<00:03:18.280> there's<00:03:18.490> this<00:03:18.760> plate<00:03:19.209> that's

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:19.420 
there's this there's this plate that's

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:22.199 
there's this there's this plate that's
on<00:03:19.630> there<00:03:19.840> that<00:03:20.459> this<00:03:21.459> is<00:03:21.610> the<00:03:21.730> reason<00:03:21.880> you<00:03:22.030> got

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:22.209 
on there that this is the reason you got

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:23.640 
on there that this is the reason you got
to<00:03:22.330> take<00:03:22.420> the<00:03:22.570> landing<00:03:22.900> gear<00:03:23.080> off<00:03:23.290> as<00:03:23.470> this

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:23.650 
to take the landing gear off as this

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:26.430 
to take the landing gear off as this
thing<00:03:23.980> I<00:03:24.480> don't<00:03:25.480> even<00:03:25.720> know<00:03:25.959> if<00:03:25.990> I'm<00:03:26.260> going<00:03:26.350> to

thing I don't even know if I'm going to

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.920 
thing I don't even know if I'm going to
put<00:03:26.590> it<00:03:26.680> back<00:03:26.800> on<00:03:27.480> because<00:03:28.480> it's<00:03:28.810> not

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:28.930 
put it back on because it's not

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:32.520 
put it back on because it's not
necessary<00:03:29.790> so<00:03:30.900> anyways<00:03:31.900> that's<00:03:32.080> what's<00:03:32.320> going
