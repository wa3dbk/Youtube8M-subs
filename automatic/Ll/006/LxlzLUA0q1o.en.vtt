bit unique about this rug the client has

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:44.180 
bit unique about this rug the client has
a<00:00:38.250> dog<00:00:38.579> and<00:00:41.360> the<00:00:42.360> dog<00:00:42.559> decided<00:00:43.559> that<00:00:43.829> it<00:00:44.040> was

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
a dog and the dog decided that it was

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.459 
a dog and the dog decided that it was
going<00:00:44.430> to<00:00:44.489> clean<00:00:44.820> up<00:00:45.000> a<00:00:45.149> spill<00:00:45.510> and<00:00:46.020> you<00:00:46.079> can

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
going to clean up a spill and you can

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.479 
going to clean up a spill and you can
see<00:00:46.710> right<00:00:47.010> here<00:00:48.469> but<00:00:49.469> there's<00:00:49.710> some<00:00:49.920> texture

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
see right here but there's some texture

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.869 
see right here but there's some texture
damage<00:00:50.910> from<00:00:51.570> this<00:00:51.980> saliva<00:00:52.980> of<00:00:53.280> the<00:00:53.399> dog<00:00:53.610> the

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
damage from this saliva of the dog the

00:00:53.879 --> 00:01:01.099 
damage from this saliva of the dog the
fibers<00:00:54.360> are<00:00:54.570> matted<00:00:55.350> down<00:00:56.719> and<00:00:58.609> flattened<00:01:00.109> and

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
fibers are matted down and flattened and

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:02.540 
fibers are matted down and flattened and
right<00:01:01.320> now<00:01:01.559> it<00:01:01.800> looks<00:01:01.980> like<00:01:02.039> there<00:01:02.340> could<00:01:02.370> be

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
right now it looks like there could be

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.410 
right now it looks like there could be
textural<00:01:04.010> difference<00:01:05.010> but<00:01:05.159> hopefully<00:01:06.030> after

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
textural difference but hopefully after

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.440 
textural difference but hopefully after
cleaning<00:01:06.900> that<00:01:07.110> will<00:01:07.260> bounce<00:01:07.470> back<00:01:08.090> so<00:01:09.090> if<00:01:09.299> you

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
cleaning that will bounce back so if you

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.740 
cleaning that will bounce back so if you
have<00:01:09.630> a<00:01:09.659> pet<00:01:09.990> that<00:01:10.070> is<00:01:11.510> constantly<00:01:12.510> licking
