00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 to her all welcome to this second 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:06.420
 part of the defense weapons guide 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:09.179
 staff as a reminder of the first 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:13.080
 episode in that episode we saw the 1 945 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:14.940
 the app 2000 and the pt wr but in this 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.890
 second part in this last episode 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:20.550
 we will see the remaining three remaining 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:22.560
 the ace vall the mp7 and the p 90 the best 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.490
 shit that we can find in this 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:28.220
 category so we started 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:29.810
 the mp7 is basically a cucumber 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:32.270
 up close and at the same time the grime of 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:34.850
 we can unlock it in the mode 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:38.420
 cooperative and its strong point no doubt 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:40.940
 is the cadence this characteristic makes 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:43.010
 that is very very powerful in the 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:46.070
 short distances and we can kill very 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:47.629
 fast but nevertheless the weapon is not 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:49.610
 so good the long distances to the 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:52.190
 time to shoot from a distance as it turns out 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:54.290
 very inefficient being very inaccurate and 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:56.360
 besides losing a lot of damage with the 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:59.180
 distance despite having the point 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:01.040
 strong to be very good up close they have 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:02.839
 the same weakness has the same failure 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:05.180
 that the app 2000 and that is that it only brings 20 

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:07.340
 bullets by charger and if we want to expand 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:09.740
 the a 40 which I assure you is very 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.390
 needed with this gun your bullets in 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.010
 the entire charger evaporates in less 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:15.470
 2 seconds 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:17.780
 if we want to expand to 40 bullets we will have 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:19.460
 to stay without the silencer a 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.380
 device that logically comes very 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:24.100
 well with weapons that are very good from 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:26.240
 but they are not so useful from a distance 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:28.510
 as I mentioned before despite 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:31.270
 have this strong point 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:33.700
 of power with three distances this 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:35.650
 weapon can be substituted in any of 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:38.850
 its aspects can be replaced by the 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:38.850
 next that we're going to see next 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:44.570
 the p 90 and if the perfect weapon for 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:46.730
 when we want to play something infiltrated 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:48.440
 has a great cadence of what the 

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:50.300
 makes it very effective and at short distances 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:52.700
 it kills very very fast when when 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:54.890
 we are close besides especially very 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:57.890
 important brings a 50-round magazine 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.420
 standard there will be no problem no 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:01.100
 We will have to expand it or nothing by 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.170
 style what allows us in addition to 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.690
 have this charger so big to be able to 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:07.550
 attach a silencer all this 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:09.110
 combined to which we have an authentic 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:11.420
 cucumber with which you lose our 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:14.600
 enemies by surprise attacking their networks 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:16.100
 to try to flank they will not have 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:18.890
 the problems that we mentioned by 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:20.600
 example with the app 2000 or the mp 7 no 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:22.640
 everything is perfection since the penalty sale 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:25.580
 how are these weapons is quite regular as 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:28.040
 in the distant distances but good if 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:29.330
 we know a little bit about what we play and if 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.630
 We always try to be close to 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:34.910
 enemy and try to catch him always by 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:36.020
 the back and by the flanks really 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:38.300
 It can become our weapon 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:41.420
 favorite to pain your big charger is 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:42.890
 really very much appreciated and if 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:46.450
 from my point of view at least 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:46.450
 Doubt is one of the best options 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:57.019
 and we finish the guide with an authentic 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:59.060
 Russian wonder the vall that stays very 

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:00.980
 near the power they can reach 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:04.040
 the assault rifles has a cadence 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:05.840
 very high and also the best precision of 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:08.510
 all weapons of self-defense that 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:10.340
 is not to say little has a time of 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:11.959
 recharge lower also that all the 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:14.659
 personal defense weapons have many 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:16.579
 virtues this weapon and is also the one that 

00:03:14.659 --> 00:03:18.769
 better preserve the damage with distance 

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:20.689
 by difference what makes it perhaps 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:23.090
 all weapons of this category the 

00:03:20.689 --> 00:03:25.579
 better when shooting long 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:26.840
 distances if it was not enough is yes yes no 

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:29.720
 all these advantages were enough 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:31.389
 carries the integrated muffler 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:33.620
 keeping all these characteristics 

00:03:31.389 --> 00:03:35.329
 that I just mentioned since 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:37.700
 we started using the gun we already have it 

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:39.349
 unlocked and integrated all this to 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:40.639
 Although it is fine if that is 

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:42.349
 true that ends up having a price not 

00:03:40.639 --> 00:03:44.989
 there may be a weapon that has everything and 

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:47.540
 that is that the weapon only brings 20 bullets 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:50.060
 per charger and these are not expandable 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:52.099
 in no way with such a cadence 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:55.250
 high the truth is that we will notice that the 

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:57.049
 charger vanishes in a second and if not 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:58.160
 we know how to keep the bullets or be 

00:03:57.049 --> 00:04:00.350
 precise really 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:02.510
 the troubles but if we say that we 

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:04.610
 we used a little to this weapon and that 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:06.920
 small limitation that you have if 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:08.960
 we try to be precise and not 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:11.270
 waste the few bullets that they give us 

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:12.710
 by glued we can end up removing him 

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:15.440
 all the game that this weapon has that 

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:17.690
 it really is a lot and very good one of 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:19.760
 the options from my point of view more 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:21.920
 recommended and that I personally 

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:23.900
 was very surprised by the quality of the 

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:26.540
 gun and good guys that's it 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:28.820
 up to here came the weapon guide 

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:30.860
 personal defense as always if it has 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:32.510
 I wish I can be useful to give 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:35.060
 like that is always very much appreciated and 

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:37.160
 Of course if you did not like it 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:41.170
 you give him and that's all friends so 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:41.170
 until the next video and see you later
