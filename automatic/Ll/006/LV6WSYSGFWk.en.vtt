00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
play right here this was a play right

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.229 
play right here this was a play right

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:45.239 
before he hurt his knee the Celtics were

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:47.330 
before he hurt his knee the Celtics were
holding<00:03:45.599> the<00:03:45.690> Lakers<00:03:46.019> to<00:03:46.200> like<00:03:46.319> five<00:03:46.920> or<00:03:47.190> six

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
holding the Lakers to like five or six

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:49.819 
holding the Lakers to like five or six
stops<00:03:47.669> in<00:03:47.879> a<00:03:48.000> row<00:03:48.150> but<00:03:48.900> what<00:03:49.230> happens<00:03:49.620> the

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:49.829 
stops in a row but what happens the

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:53.420 
stops in a row but what happens the
Lakers<00:03:50.280> gets<00:03:50.519> 9<00:03:50.879> 10<00:03:51.449> 13<00:03:51.889> offensive<00:03:52.889> rebounds

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
Lakers gets 9 10 13 offensive rebounds

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:54.559 
Lakers gets 9 10 13 offensive rebounds
and<00:03:53.730> that's<00:03:53.910> why<00:03:54.090> they<00:03:54.209> were<00:03:54.269> able<00:03:54.329> to<00:03:54.449> come

00:03:54.559 --> 00:03:54.569 
and that's why they were able to come

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:56.539 
and that's why they were able to come
over<00:03:54.780> to<00:03:54.870> hump<00:03:55.049> so<00:03:55.199> if<00:03:55.319> both<00:03:55.500> O'Neal's<00:03:55.980> can

00:03:56.539 --> 00:03:56.549 
over to hump so if both O'Neal's can

00:03:56.549 --> 00:03:57.890 
over to hump so if both O'Neal's can
come<00:03:56.730> in<00:03:56.819> and<00:03:56.910> give<00:03:57.030> the<00:03:57.120> interior<00:03:57.449> defensive

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
come in and give the interior defensive

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:59.390 
come in and give the interior defensive
rebounding<00:03:58.379> maybe<00:03:58.799> they<00:03:58.859> can<00:03:58.980> hold<00:03:59.040> the<00:03:59.190> fort

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 
rebounding maybe they can hold the fort

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:00.979 
rebounding maybe they can hold the fort
down<00:03:59.430> to<00:03:59.579> he<00:03:59.760> gets<00:03:59.940> healthy<00:04:00.120> and<00:04:00.269> I<00:04:00.840> don't

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:00.989 
down to he gets healthy and I don't

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:02.330

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:22.260 
tough he plays hard and emotional he can

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:23.750 
tough he plays hard and emotional he can
be<00:04:22.320> a<00:04:22.349> little<00:04:22.470> too<00:04:22.710> emotional<00:04:22.949> sometimes<00:04:23.430> they

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:23.760 
be a little too emotional sometimes they

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:25.010 
be a little too emotional sometimes they
caught<00:04:23.970> up<00:04:24.120> with<00:04:24.240> him<00:04:24.300> it<00:04:24.479> was<00:04:24.599> so<00:04:24.750> funny

00:04:54.479 --> 00:04:54.879 
baby I think he is the energy guy they
need

00:04:54.879 --> 00:04:54.889 
need

00:04:54.889 --> 00:04:56.350 
need
off<00:04:55.069> the<00:04:55.219> bench<00:04:55.400> he<00:04:55.639> does<00:04:55.819> a<00:04:55.849> lot<00:04:56.060> of<00:04:56.120> things

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:56.360 
off the bench he does a lot of things

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:57.489 
off the bench he does a lot of things
but<00:04:56.599> he<00:04:56.689> gives<00:04:56.810> them<00:04:56.960> a<00:04:57.080> different<00:04:57.379> dimension

00:04:57.489 --> 00:04:57.499 
but he gives them a different dimension

00:04:57.499 --> 00:04:59.230 
but he gives them a different dimension
he's<00:04:57.860> tough<00:04:58.129> he's<00:04:58.550> a<00:04:58.580> little<00:04:58.789> undersized<00:04:58.969> but

00:04:59.230 --> 00:04:59.240 
he's tough he's a little undersized but

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:01.209 
he's tough he's a little undersized but
he<00:04:59.629> doesn't<00:04:59.870> play<00:05:00.020> undersized<00:05:00.499> you<00:05:00.979> know<00:05:01.099> he

00:05:01.209 --> 00:05:01.219 
he doesn't play undersized you know he

00:05:01.219 --> 00:05:02.709 
he doesn't play undersized you know he
can<00:05:01.370> stop<00:05:01.610> and<00:05:01.819> shoot<00:05:01.969> a<00:05:02.090> mid-range<00:05:02.419> he<00:05:02.629> can

00:05:02.709 --> 00:05:02.719 
can stop and shoot a mid-range he can

00:05:02.719 --> 00:05:05.439 
can stop and shoot a mid-range he can
get<00:05:02.780> to<00:05:02.900> the<00:05:02.990> basket<00:05:03.139> and<00:05:03.949> he's<00:05:04.099> he<00:05:04.969> somehow

00:05:05.439 --> 00:05:05.449 
get to the basket and he's he somehow

00:05:05.449 --> 00:05:06.730
