00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
very comparable to Victor certainly to

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.520 
very comparable to Victor certainly to
Silvio<00:01:38.909> and<00:01:39.119> conditioning<00:01:39.689> again<00:01:39.990> maybe<00:01:40.170> so

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
Silvio and conditioning again maybe so

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:41.300 
Silvio and conditioning again maybe so
vo<00:01:40.680> probably<00:01:40.950> gonna<00:01:41.040> be<00:01:41.189> the<00:01:41.280> most

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
vo probably gonna be the most

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.609 
vo probably gonna be the most
conditioned<00:01:41.820> guy<00:01:41.909> in<00:01:42.000> the<00:01:42.090> show<00:01:42.210> as<00:01:42.390> usual<00:01:42.619> my

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
conditioned guy in the show as usual my

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.499 
conditioned guy in the show as usual my
concern<00:01:43.979> for<00:01:44.159> Kyle<00:01:44.399> Dan<00:01:44.729> is<00:01:45.000> again<00:01:45.329> the

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
concern for Kyle Dan is again the

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.719 
concern for Kyle Dan is again the
blockiness<00:01:45.960> factor<00:01:46.500> he's<00:01:47.310> a<00:01:47.340> little<00:01:47.640> bit

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
blockiness factor he's a little bit

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.370 
blockiness factor he's a little bit
wider<00:01:47.909> in<00:01:48.119> the<00:01:48.180> way<00:01:48.299> C's<00:01:48.570> days<00:01:48.840> are<00:01:49.049> gonna<00:01:49.170> see

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
wider in the way C's days are gonna see

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.219 
wider in the way C's days are gonna see
right<00:01:49.590> here<00:01:49.770> with<00:01:49.920> the<00:01:50.009> abdominal<00:01:50.520> shot<00:01:51.229> it's

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
right here with the abdominal shot it's

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:53.210 
right here with the abdominal shot it's
conditioning<00:01:52.680> is<00:01:52.740> good<00:01:52.860> but<00:01:52.979> you're<00:01:53.100> not

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
conditioning is good but you're not

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.670 
conditioning is good but you're not
seeing<00:01:53.670> that<00:01:53.939> b<00:01:54.210> taper<00:01:54.509> and<00:01:54.930> you<00:01:55.320> can<00:01:55.470> see<00:01:55.590> it

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
seeing that b taper and you can see it

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.920 
seeing that b taper and you can see it
right<00:01:55.799> there<00:01:55.860> then<00:01:56.340> with<00:01:57.270> Kai<00:01:57.450> green<00:01:57.750> now

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
right there then with Kai green now

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.929 
right there then with Kai green now
again<00:01:58.259> how<00:01:58.799> does<00:01:58.860> that<00:01:59.100> compare<00:01:59.310> well<00:01:59.759> you're

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
again how does that compare well you're

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.219 
again how does that compare well you're
gonna<00:02:00.030> see<00:02:00.119> that<00:02:00.390> comparison<00:02:00.810> when<00:02:01.110> he's

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
gonna see that comparison when he's

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.230 
gonna see that comparison when he's
standing<00:02:01.380> next<00:02:01.680> to<00:02:01.829> Tony<00:02:02.040> Freeman<00:02:02.579> who<00:02:03.030> is
