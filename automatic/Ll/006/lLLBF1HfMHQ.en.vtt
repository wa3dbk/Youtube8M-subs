00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:44.660 
the team with pistola as opposed to tots
well<00:04:43.020> really<00:04:43.380> I<00:04:43.800> think<00:04:43.830> they<00:04:44.130> like<00:04:44.190> pretty

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:44.670 
well really I think they like pretty

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:45.740 
well really I think they like pretty
much<00:04:44.820> the<00:04:44.940> same<00:04:45.090> player<00:04:45.330> that<00:04:45.360> will<00:04:45.570> have<00:04:45.720> a

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:45.750 
much the same player that will have a

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:48.200 
much the same player that will have a
great<00:04:45.960> shots<00:04:46.260> they<00:04:46.800> both<00:04:46.980> bring<00:04:47.880> a<00:04:47.970> lot<00:04:48.060> to<00:04:48.090> the

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:48.210 
great shots they both bring a lot to the

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:50.840 
great shots they both bring a lot to the
team<00:04:48.420> I<00:04:48.480> mean<00:04:48.870> I<00:04:49.160> obviously<00:04:50.160> pretty<00:04:50.670> much

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:50.850 
team I mean I obviously pretty much

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:52.220 
team I mean I obviously pretty much
placing<00:04:51.210> the<00:04:51.300> same<00:04:51.420> as<00:04:51.540> Widow<00:04:51.690> attachment

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:52.230 
placing the same as Widow attachment

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:55.040 
placing the same as Widow attachment
pistola<00:04:52.500> I<00:04:52.880> think<00:04:53.880> pistol<00:04:54.330> might<00:04:54.840> have<00:04:54.960> a

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:55.050 
pistola I think pistol might have a

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:56.720 
pistola I think pistol might have a
little<00:04:55.230> bit<00:04:55.320> more<00:04:55.470> just<00:04:55.740> laying<00:04:56.010> Ross<00:04:56.400> Lane

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:56.730 
little bit more just laying Ross Lane

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:58.880 
little bit more just laying Ross Lane
power<00:04:56.970> like<00:04:57.480> as<00:04:57.720> a<00:04:57.750> whole<00:04:57.960> were<00:04:58.170> a<00:04:58.410> little<00:04:58.740> bit

00:04:58.880 --> 00:04:58.890 
power like as a whole were a little bit

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:01.340 
power like as a whole were a little bit
more<00:04:59.010> slang<00:04:59.310> oriented<00:04:59.910> we<00:05:00.330> uh<00:05:00.360> we<00:05:00.870> can<00:05:01.020> kill<00:05:01.320> a

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:01.350 
more slang oriented we uh we can kill a

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:03.800 
more slang oriented we uh we can kill a
lot<00:05:01.590> easier<00:05:01.980> and<00:05:02.340> faster<00:05:02.490> now<00:05:02.850> so<00:05:03.120> I<00:05:03.300> think<00:05:03.690> if

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:03.810 
lot easier and faster now so I think if

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:04.970 
lot easier and faster now so I think if
we<00:05:03.900> would<00:05:04.020> have<00:05:04.050> kept<00:05:04.290> a<00:05:04.440> sweet<00:05:04.680> wooden<00:05:04.830> able

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:04.980 
we would have kept a sweet wooden able

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:06.380 
we would have kept a sweet wooden able
to<00:05:05.040> do<00:05:05.100> the<00:05:05.220> same<00:05:05.370> damage<00:05:05.640> if<00:05:05.820> not<00:05:06.000> more<00:05:06.210> with

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:06.390 
to do the same damage if not more with

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:07.850 
to do the same damage if not more with
three<00:05:06.870> of<00:05:06.960> us<00:05:07.080> being<00:05:07.290> here<00:05:07.380> the<00:05:07.530> whole<00:05:07.680> summer
