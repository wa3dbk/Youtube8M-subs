that's<00:00:42.900> important<00:00:43.500> just<00:00:44.370> to<00:00:44.430> allow<00:00:44.730> nature<00:00:45.120> to

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
that's important just to allow nature to

that's important just to allow nature to
do<00:00:45.600> its<00:00:45.750> thing<00:00:45.810> you<00:00:46.110> know<00:00:46.230> whereas<00:00:46.500> Trout

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
do its thing you know whereas Trout

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.710 
do its thing you know whereas Trout
Unlimited<00:00:47.310> Canada<00:00:47.700> were<00:00:48.329> all<00:00:48.450> about

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:48.720 
Unlimited Canada were all about

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:50.930 
Unlimited Canada were all about
protecting<00:00:49.200> conserving<00:00:49.980> and<00:00:50.070> restoring<00:00:50.760> and

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
protecting conserving and restoring and

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.180 
protecting conserving and restoring and
this<00:00:51.090> is<00:00:51.270> actually<00:00:51.660> restoration<00:00:52.440> it's<00:00:52.890> taking

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
this is actually restoration it's taking

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.410 
this is actually restoration it's taking
away<00:00:53.310> something<00:00:53.730> that<00:00:53.820> was<00:00:53.940> put<00:00:54.150> in<00:00:54.270> there<00:00:54.390> a

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
away something that was put in there a

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.390 
away something that was put in there a
long<00:00:54.690> time<00:00:54.960> ago<00:00:55.200> that<00:00:55.230> became<00:00:55.739> a<00:00:55.800> barrier<00:00:56.340> to

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:56.400 
long time ago that became a barrier to

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.700 
long time ago that became a barrier to
fish<00:00:56.730> movement<00:00:57.180> and<00:00:57.720> a<00:00:57.870> safety<00:00:58.380> issue<00:00:58.530> for

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
fish movement and a safety issue for

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.100 
fish movement and a safety issue for
some<00:00:59.640> of<00:00:59.760> the<00:00:59.850> residents<00:01:00.390> in<00:01:00.480> the<00:01:00.570> area<00:01:00.600> so<00:01:01.050> it

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:01.110 
some of the residents in the area so it

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:02.569 
some of the residents in the area so it
was<00:01:01.230> important<00:01:01.649> to<00:01:01.710> get<00:01:01.829> it<00:01:01.950> out<00:01:02.100> and<00:01:02.430> to

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
was important to get it out and to

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.729 
was important to get it out and to
naturalize<00:01:03.239> the<00:01:03.450> area<00:01:03.750> and<00:01:04.229> just<00:01:04.259> allow

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
naturalize the area and just allow

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.060 
naturalize the area and just allow
things<00:01:05.009> to<00:01:05.159> happen<00:01:05.579> naturally<00:01:06.680> to<00:01:07.680> do<00:01:07.860> this

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
things to happen naturally to do this

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.850 
things to happen naturally to do this
project<00:01:08.340> really<00:01:08.940> took<00:01:09.180> about<00:01:09.510> two<00:01:09.870> years<00:01:09.900> from

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
project really took about two years from

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.770 
project really took about two years from
the<00:01:10.920> time<00:01:11.250> everybody<00:01:11.820> sat<00:01:12.090> down<00:01:12.270> at<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.540> table

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
the time everybody sat down at the table

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.560 
the time everybody sat down at the table
and<00:01:13.229> decided<00:01:13.710> it<00:01:13.890> was<00:01:14.010> a<00:01:14.040> good<00:01:14.340> idea<00:01:14.370> it<00:01:15.360> all

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
and decided it was a good idea it all

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.130 
and decided it was a good idea it all
agreed<00:01:15.990> it<00:01:16.020> was<00:01:16.290> a<00:01:16.320> good<00:01:16.560> idea<00:01:17.630> to<00:01:18.630> go<00:01:18.840> through

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
agreed it was a good idea to go through

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.969 
agreed it was a good idea to go through
all<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.560> process<00:01:19.830> of<00:01:21.260> approvals<00:01:22.260> permits

that we were hoping to be able to let

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.219 
that we were hoping to be able to let

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
back into the Grand River so it would be

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.090
