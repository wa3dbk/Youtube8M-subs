I<00:00:52.010> think<00:00:52.969> that<00:00:54.399> crime<00:00:55.399> is<00:00:55.429> part<00:00:56.089> of<00:00:56.210> everything

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:56.510 
I think that crime is part of everything

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:58.930 
I think that crime is part of everything
we<00:00:57.019> are<00:00:57.050> it's<00:00:57.649> part<00:00:57.980> of<00:00:58.010> the<00:00:58.100> society<00:00:58.309> we<00:00:58.789> live

we are it's part of the society we live
in<00:00:59.000> its<00:00:59.300> part<00:00:59.570> of<00:00:59.659> what's<00:00:59.809> going<00:01:00.079> on
