dry<00:01:17.390> ingredients<00:01:18.200> in<00:01:18.290> this<00:01:18.500> bowl<00:01:18.799> now<00:01:18.979> I

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:19.220 
dry ingredients in this bowl now I

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:21.700 
dry ingredients in this bowl now I
prefer<00:01:19.580> to<00:01:19.970> use<00:01:20.150> cake<00:01:20.510> flour<00:01:20.619> instead<00:01:21.619> of

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:21.710 
prefer to use cake flour instead of

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:24.250 
prefer to use cake flour instead of
all-purpose<00:01:21.890> flour<00:01:22.369> because<00:01:23.030> I<00:01:23.210> find<00:01:23.720> that<00:01:24.020> it

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:24.260 
all-purpose flour because I find that it

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.250 
all-purpose flour because I find that it
gives<00:01:24.500> me<00:01:24.770> a<00:01:24.799> much<00:01:25.340> lighter<00:01:26.119> fritter<00:01:26.780> it's<00:01:27.080> not

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:27.260 
gives me a much lighter fritter it's not

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.440 
gives me a much lighter fritter it's not
as<00:01:27.409> dense<00:01:27.770> and<00:01:28.250> that's<00:01:28.760> just<00:01:28.970> what<00:01:29.060> I<00:01:29.090> prefer

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:29.450 
as dense and that's just what I prefer

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:30.969 
as dense and that's just what I prefer
but<00:01:29.600> if<00:01:29.720> you<00:01:29.840> can't<00:01:30.110> get<00:01:30.259> your<00:01:30.320> hands<00:01:30.650> on<00:01:30.710> cake

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:30.979 
but if you can't get your hands on cake

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:32.350 
but if you can't get your hands on cake
flour<00:01:31.250> by<00:01:31.490> all<00:01:31.670> means<00:01:31.880> just<00:01:32.000> use<00:01:32.180> all-purpose

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:32.360 
flour by all means just use all-purpose

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.810 
flour by all means just use all-purpose
flour<00:01:32.840> however<00:01:33.710> I<00:01:33.950> do<00:01:34.070> think<00:01:34.310> you<00:01:34.580> should<00:01:34.610> go

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:34.820 
flour however I do think you should go

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:36.429 
flour however I do think you should go
the<00:01:34.939> extra<00:01:35.060> mile<00:01:35.420> and<00:01:35.450> try<00:01:35.780> to<00:01:35.840> look<00:01:36.049> for<00:01:36.080> cake

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:36.439 
the extra mile and try to look for cake

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:38.140 
the extra mile and try to look for cake
flour<00:01:36.710> because<00:01:37.100> it<00:01:37.130> gives<00:01:37.430> you<00:01:37.580> just<00:01:37.700> a<00:01:37.850> much

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:38.150 
flour because it gives you just a much

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:41.260 
flour because it gives you just a much
better<00:01:38.360> texture<00:01:38.900> in<00:01:39.049> my<00:01:39.259> opinion<00:01:39.710> okay<00:01:40.280> now

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
better texture in my opinion okay now

not the imitation stuff got to be the

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:22.190 
not the imitation stuff got to be the
real<00:02:21.630> deal

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:01.739 
thermometer this is how my Nona does it

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:04.220 
thermometer this is how my Nona does it
and<00:03:01.920> it<00:03:02.040> works<00:03:02.220> every<00:03:02.430> single<00:03:03.030> time<00:03:03.360> you<00:03:04.080> take

and it works every single time you take

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.890 
and it works every single time you take

a wooden spoon handle down make sure

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.960 
a wooden spoon handle down make sure
it's<00:03:07.140> clean<00:03:07.440> and<00:03:07.680> if<00:03:08.160> you<00:03:08.280> see<00:03:08.459> any<00:03:08.640> bubbles

it's clean and if you see any bubbles

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.449 
it's clean and if you see any bubbles

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 
spoon your oil is nice and hot it should

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:17.120 
spoon your oil is nice and hot it should
be<00:03:13.860> around<00:03:15.110> 360<00:03:16.110> degrees<00:03:16.140> or<00:03:16.620> so

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
be around 360 degrees or so

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:19.400 
be around 360 degrees or so
no<00:03:17.550> lower<00:03:17.880> because<00:03:18.330> I<00:03:18.450> find<00:03:18.750> that<00:03:18.870> if<00:03:19.019> it's<00:03:19.170> any

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.410 
no lower because I find that if it's any

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:22.250 
no lower because I find that if it's any
cooler<00:03:19.830> than<00:03:19.950> that<00:03:20.190> then<00:03:20.670> the<00:03:21.120> apple<00:03:21.989> fritters

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
cooler than that then the apple fritters

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:23.570 
cooler than that then the apple fritters
just<00:03:22.470> become<00:03:22.769> a<00:03:22.799> little<00:03:22.920> bit<00:03:23.100> stir<00:03:23.370> a<00:03:23.400> little

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:23.580 
just become a little bit stir a little

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:25.580 
just become a little bit stir a little
bit<00:03:23.670> too<00:03:23.880> oily<00:03:24.120> and<00:03:24.480> then<00:03:24.900> I<00:03:25.019> just<00:03:25.200> use<00:03:25.380> my

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
bit too oily and then I just use my

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:27.229 
bit too oily and then I just use my
small<00:03:25.890> ice<00:03:26.100> cream<00:03:26.130> scoop<00:03:26.370> the<00:03:26.790> equivalent

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239 
small ice cream scoop the equivalent

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:29.240 
small ice cream scoop the equivalent
about<00:03:27.450> one<00:03:27.690> tablespoon<00:03:27.930> and<00:03:28.560> make<00:03:28.950> little

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
about one tablespoon and make little

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:30.949 
about one tablespoon and make little
ones<00:03:29.549> rather<00:03:29.880> than<00:03:30.120> really<00:03:30.299> big<00:03:30.570> ones<00:03:30.780> because

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 
ones rather than really big ones because

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:33.289 
ones rather than really big ones because
then<00:03:31.200> I<00:03:31.260> feel<00:03:31.470> like<00:03:31.500> it's<00:03:31.739> just<00:03:31.860> more<00:03:32.299> they're

00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:33.299 
then I feel like it's just more they're

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:35.000 
then I feel like it's just more they're
just<00:03:33.480> yeah<00:03:33.690> a<00:03:33.720> lot<00:03:34.080> more<00:03:34.110> of<00:03:34.530> them<00:03:34.680> and<00:03:34.890> they're

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
just yeah a lot more of them and they're

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:37.640 
just yeah a lot more of them and they're
