00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
extremely low wire level which means

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.120 
extremely low wire level which means
you'll<00:01:12.450> you<00:01:13.110> don't<00:01:13.350> really<00:01:13.470> need<00:01:13.830> to<00:01:13.979> dig

to like it's kind of like well I can
general<00:01:21.600> my<00:01:21.750> walls<00:01:22.020> then<00:01:22.650> I<00:01:22.680> can<00:01:22.979> dig<00:01:23.159> the

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
general my walls then I can dig the

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.760 
general my walls then I can dig the
trenches<00:01:23.700> after<00:01:24.270> bit<00:01:24.509> by<00:01:24.720> bit<00:01:24.750> as<00:01:25.080> I<00:01:25.350> feel<00:01:25.590> like

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
trenches after bit by bit as I feel like

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.010 
trenches after bit by bit as I feel like
it<00:01:25.979> so<00:01:26.220> I<00:01:26.460> highly<00:01:27.119> recommend<00:01:27.540> doing<00:01:27.720> it<00:01:27.930> in

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
it so I highly recommend doing it in

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.840 
it so I highly recommend doing it in

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
ocean so once you find it an ocean a

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.670 
ocean so once you find it an ocean a
good<00:01:30.090> spot<00:01:30.329> for<00:01:30.360> your<00:01:30.600> base<00:01:30.840> you're<00:01:31.500> going<00:01:31.530> to

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680

00:03:43.589 --> 00:03:43.599 
inside the base this is what I wanted to

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:45.150 
inside the base this is what I wanted to
show<00:03:43.780> you<00:03:43.840> guys<00:03:43.930> right<00:03:44.349> now<00:03:44.380> and<00:03:44.829> now<00:03:44.980> what

somewhere<00:03:49.599> I'm<00:03:49.720> gonna<00:03:49.959> do

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:50.540 
somewhere I'm gonna do

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:52.479 
somewhere I'm gonna do
to<00:03:50.719> do<00:03:50.810> that<00:03:50.959> with<00:03:51.110> well<00:03:51.379> done<00:03:51.590> it<00:03:51.709> just<00:03:51.920> so<00:03:52.370> it

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:52.489 
to do that with well done it just so it

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:54.520 
to do that with well done it just so it
makes<00:03:52.670> it<00:03:52.760> a<00:03:52.849> little<00:03:53.030> bit<00:03:53.269> easier<00:03:53.750> a<00:03:54.019> little

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:54.530 
makes it a little bit easier a little

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:55.990 
makes it a little bit easier a little
bit<00:03:54.799> quicker<00:03:55.040> on<00:03:55.219> the<00:03:55.310> tutorial<00:03:55.760> so<00:03:55.879> you're

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.000 
bit quicker on the tutorial so you're

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.509 
bit quicker on the tutorial so you're
gonna<00:03:56.090> go<00:03:56.269> such<00:03:56.540> that<00:03:56.719> set<00:03:56.930> zero<00:03:57.290> and<00:03:57.590> once<00:03:58.370> you

00:03:58.509 --> 00:03:58.519 
gonna go such that set zero and once you

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:00.130 
gonna go such that set zero and once you
have<00:03:58.700> a<00:03:58.730> cut<00:03:59.030> in<00:03:59.239> your<00:03:59.329> base<00:03:59.540> like<00:03:59.780> that<00:03:59.810> so

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:00.140 
have a cut in your base like that so

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:01.630 
have a cut in your base like that so
it's<00:04:00.290> gonna<00:04:00.379> be<00:04:00.560> just<00:04:00.920> like<00:04:01.189> cutting<00:04:01.459> your

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:01.640 
it's gonna be just like cutting your

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:03.550 
it's gonna be just like cutting your
base<00:04:01.849> in<00:04:02.060> half<00:04:02.269> you<00:04:02.780> want<00:04:02.930> to<00:04:03.019> go<00:04:03.109> ahead<00:04:03.379> with

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:03.560 
base in half you want to go ahead with

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:06.580 
base in half you want to go ahead with
water<00:04:04.159> buckets<00:04:04.609> or<00:04:04.790> ice<00:04:05.000> it<00:04:05.420> does<00:04:05.810> not<00:04:06.140> matter

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:06.590 
water buckets or ice it does not matter

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:09.280 
water buckets or ice it does not matter
and<00:04:06.790> you're<00:04:07.790> gonna<00:04:07.909> water<00:04:08.269> this<00:04:08.480> whole<00:04:08.930> layer

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:09.290 
and you're gonna water this whole layer

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:11.830 
and you're gonna water this whole layer
here<00:04:09.590> so<00:04:09.829> once<00:04:10.010> you've<00:04:10.159> done<00:04:10.280> that<00:04:10.810> you<00:04:11.810> just

sponges<00:04:58.940> work<00:04:59.180> on<00:04:59.389> this<00:04:59.539> server<00:04:59.810> so<00:05:00.139> rip<00:05:00.919> this

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:01.130 
sponges work on this server so rip this

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:04.450 
sponges work on this server so rip this
platform<00:05:01.490> but<00:05:01.970> anyways<00:05:03.099> they<00:05:04.099> should<00:05:04.310> be

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:04.460 
platform but anyways they should be

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:06.460 
platform but anyways they should be
working<00:05:04.699> on<00:05:05.030> most<00:05:05.300> faction<00:05:05.840> service<00:05:06.260> they<00:05:06.440> are

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:06.470 
working on most faction service they are

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:08.680 
working on most faction service they are
enabled<00:05:07.070> so<00:05:07.880> once<00:05:08.030> you've<00:05:08.150> done<00:05:08.270> that<00:05:08.330> you're

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:08.690 
enabled so once you've done that you're

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:10.450 
enabled so once you've done that you're
just<00:05:08.780> gonna<00:05:09.020> pretty<00:05:10.010> much<00:05:10.220> you're<00:05:10.400> gonna

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:10.460 
just gonna pretty much you're gonna

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:13.240 
just gonna pretty much you're gonna
water<00:05:10.849> these<00:05:11.060> walls<00:05:11.800> and<00:05:12.800> then<00:05:12.979> you're<00:05:13.099> gonna

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:13.250 
water these walls and then you're gonna

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:15.580 
water these walls and then you're gonna
join<00:05:13.460> a<00:05:13.520> bunch<00:05:13.699> of<00:05:13.909> walls<00:05:14.090> and<00:05:14.449> corner<00:05:15.289> fillers

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:15.590 
join a bunch of walls and corner fillers

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:18.000 
join a bunch of walls and corner fillers
and<00:05:15.830> you're<00:05:15.949> pretty<00:05:16.460> much<00:05:16.639> done<00:05:16.940> from<00:05:17.240> then

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:18.010 
and you're pretty much done from then

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:19.990 
and you're pretty much done from then
yeah<00:05:19.010> that's<00:05:19.159> about<00:05:19.580> it

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:20.000 
yeah that's about it

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.629 
yeah that's about it
Oh<00:05:20.090> none<00:05:20.690> and<00:05:20.900> one<00:05:21.229> more<00:05:21.409> thing<00:05:21.620> is<00:05:21.949> when<00:05:22.550> you

00:05:22.629 --> 00:05:22.639 
Oh none and one more thing is when you

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:24.969 
Oh none and one more thing is when you
actually<00:05:23.120> do<00:05:23.360> get<00:05:23.690> to<00:05:23.750> joining<00:05:24.139> in<00:05:24.320> a<00:05:24.380> wall<00:05:24.560> so

00:05:24.969 --> 00:05:24.979 
actually do get to joining in a wall so

00:05:24.979 --> 00:05:27.820 
actually do get to joining in a wall so
let's<00:05:25.699> say<00:05:25.940> you've<00:05:26.300> joined<00:05:26.630> or<00:05:27.260> actually<00:05:27.680> made

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:27.830 
let's say you've joined or actually made

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:31.390 
let's say you've joined or actually made
this<00:05:27.949> tool<00:05:28.250> or<00:05:28.570> let<00:05:29.570> me<00:05:29.659> go<00:05:29.810> down<00:05:30.169> one<00:05:30.500> down<00:05:31.070> to

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:31.400 
this tool or let me go down one down to

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:33.610 
this tool or let me go down one down to
actually<00:05:31.789> let's<00:05:32.300> say<00:05:32.479> this<00:05:32.720> is<00:05:32.900> the<00:05:33.080> wall<00:05:33.289> here

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:33.620 
actually let's say this is the wall here

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:35.860 
actually let's say this is the wall here
for<00:05:33.979> instance<00:05:34.430> this<00:05:34.909> isn't<00:05:35.300> the<00:05:35.449> full<00:05:35.659> wall<00:05:35.840> of

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:35.870 
for instance this isn't the full wall of

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:38.200 
for instance this isn't the full wall of
course<00:05:36.430> and<00:05:37.430> you're<00:05:37.550> gonna<00:05:37.669> have<00:05:37.820> a<00:05:37.849> sponge

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:38.210 
course and you're gonna have a sponge

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:40.750 
course and you're gonna have a sponge
tray<00:05:38.599> here<00:05:38.930> just<00:05:39.560> underneath<00:05:40.070> this<00:05:40.460> thing

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:40.760 
tray here just underneath this thing

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:44.200 
tray here just underneath this thing
right<00:05:41.030> here<00:05:41.060> and<00:05:42.430> what<00:05:43.430> you're<00:05:43.550> gonna<00:05:43.639> do<00:05:43.880> is

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:44.210 
right here and what you're gonna do is

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:46.420 
right here and what you're gonna do is
you<00:05:44.599> want<00:05:44.750> to<00:05:44.810> get<00:05:44.930> some<00:05:45.199> ice<00:05:45.409> or<00:05:45.830> some<00:05:46.220> water

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:46.430 
you want to get some ice or some water

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:48.580 
you want to get some ice or some water
buckets<00:05:46.849> either<00:05:47.120> one<00:05:47.449> it<00:05:47.690> doesn't<00:05:48.110> matter<00:05:48.289> and

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:48.590 
buckets either one it doesn't matter and

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:50.170 
buckets either one it doesn't matter and
you're<00:05:49.220> going<00:05:49.340> to<00:05:49.370> need<00:05:49.490> to<00:05:49.610> water<00:05:49.880> the

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:50.180 
you're going to need to water the

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:52.450 
you're going to need to water the
underneath<00:05:50.810> of<00:05:51.050> the<00:05:51.139> wall<00:05:51.320> so<00:05:51.530> obviously<00:05:51.949> the

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:52.460 
underneath of the wall so obviously the

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:54.610 
underneath of the wall so obviously the
water's<00:05:52.789> gonna<00:05:52.909> go<00:05:53.180> everywhere<00:05:53.870> but<00:05:54.259> once<00:05:54.470> you

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:54.620 
water's gonna go everywhere but once you

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:57.219 
water's gonna go everywhere but once you
have<00:05:54.830> the<00:05:55.009> sponge<00:05:55.250> trays<00:05:55.750> like<00:05:56.750> I<00:05:56.810> showed<00:05:57.169> you

00:05:57.219 --> 00:05:57.229 
have the sponge trays like I showed you

00:05:57.229 --> 00:05:59.950 
have the sponge trays like I showed you
over<00:05:57.710> there<00:05:57.979> it<00:05:58.490> shouldn't<00:05:59.029> flow<00:05:59.270> anywhere

00:05:59.950 --> 00:05:59.960 
over there it shouldn't flow anywhere

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:02.399 
over there it shouldn't flow anywhere
it's<00:06:00.680> just<00:06:00.919> because<00:06:01.250> sponges<00:06:01.760> don't<00:06:01.940> work

00:06:02.399 --> 00:06:02.409 
it's just because sponges don't work

00:06:02.409 --> 00:06:04.290 
it's just because sponges don't work
correctly<00:06:02.619> on<00:06:02.769> this<00:06:02.949> level<00:06:03.219> so<00:06:03.969> once<00:06:04.149> you've

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:04.300 
correctly on this level so once you've

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:06.059 
correctly on this level so once you've
done<00:06:04.389> that<00:06:04.449> you've<00:06:04.869> pretty<00:06:05.289> much<00:06:05.409> done<00:06:05.800> via

00:06:06.059 --> 00:06:06.069 
done that you've pretty much done via

00:06:06.069 --> 00:06:08.489 
done that you've pretty much done via
base<00:06:06.339> besides<00:06:06.909> like<00:06:07.179> adding<00:06:07.539> extra<00:06:07.869> defenses

00:06:08.489 --> 00:06:08.499 
base besides like adding extra defenses

00:06:08.499 --> 00:06:10.829 
base besides like adding extra defenses
and<00:06:08.619> digging<00:06:08.979> trenches<00:06:09.189> and<00:06:09.759> etc<00:06:10.330> like<00:06:10.629> that

00:06:10.829 --> 00:06:10.839 
and digging trenches and etc like that

00:06:10.839 --> 00:06:12.749 
and digging trenches and etc like that
so<00:06:11.139> that's<00:06:11.769> pretty<00:06:11.979> much<00:06:12.069> it<00:06:12.189> for<00:06:12.369> today's
