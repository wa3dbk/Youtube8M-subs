00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:19.909
 find noise on a belt find out 

00:00:17.929 --> 00:00:20.659
 its cause in general a diagnosis 

00:00:19.909 --> 00:00:22.519
 difficult 

00:00:20.659 --> 00:00:24.769
 noise does not appear because of a problem in the 

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:27.169
 strap so change strap only 

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:28.009
 will slow down the discovery the true 

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:30.079
 problem 

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:31.880
 the assumed refers generally is a 

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:34.190
 problem of misalignment between 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:36.949
 policemen and the alternator police 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:39.410
 the goe of the belt on the other hand indicates 

00:00:36.949 --> 00:00:41.390
 loss of stress due to wear failure 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:43.670
 of the tensioner or both 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:46.519
 the two must be replaced in order to 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:48.559
 leave the system new again the question 

00:00:46.519 --> 00:00:50.719
 simple test that will help determine 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:52.609
 if the belt noise is a problem 

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:53.809
 system alignment or arrest 

00:00:52.609 --> 00:00:55.460
 wrong belt 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:57.260
 if it is an alignment problem the 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.059
 test will locate the component or 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:01.100
 pulley out of alignment 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:03.109
 before we start here, there's an alert 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.660
 this test is done with the motor on 

00:01:03.109 --> 00:01:07.160
 so it is highly recommended that 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:09.800
 performed by a technician 

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:11.930
 professional body parts clothing and 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.910
 tools must be kept out of the 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:15.950
 reach of moving engine parts 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:18.110
 Failure to do so may result in 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:20.360
 in a serious injury accident 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:21.710
 first filled the spray bottle with 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.870
 tap water 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.880
 make sure it is only water 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:28.310
 because it will sprinkle strap 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:30.620
 then reproduces the conditions of 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:32.960
 when the noise was perceived for example 

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:35.180
 if you heard the climb run when the 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.110
 engine was cold performs this test 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:38.120
 in the morning 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:40.190
 the object is to spray water on the side 

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:42.380
 ribbed micro belt see what it does 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:44.870
 contact the police the place where the 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:47.060
 noise seems to come can be difficult 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:49.070
 determine the correct location but not 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.810
 noise misalignment 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:51.560
 the shortest distance from the 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.930
 belt 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.820
 ie the part of the belt with smaller 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:57.920
 distance between the two police 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:59.960
 this applies especially if one of the 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:02.990
 police officers with short distance 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:05.000
 back side of the belt for example 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:07.160
 this is a water pump driven by the 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.410
 belt back promote me 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:12.890
 check that a short distance between 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:14.860
 This police and the next one will 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:17.470
 sprinkle ribbed side of the color 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:20.080
 and that makes contact with the police the water 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:21.820
 rotate as in kant briefing if including 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:24.370
 stay taller when strap was 

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:28.720
 sprinkled means that it is not 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:31.690
 sufficient containment both tensioner 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:33.700
 should be replaced by 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:35.260
 other side if noise has been eliminated 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:38.050
 momentarily when strap was 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:39.760
 sprinkled and then reappear means 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:41.650
 that one or more police officers at that location 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:43.870
 is out of alignment 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:45.550
 if there is no change in running noise 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:47.980
 check the next shortest distance 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:49.840
 belt and spray again on site. 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:52.480
 where the run makes contact with the second 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:54.190
 pulley circuit stop and then back 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:57.459
 You have identified the location of the 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:59.709
 misalignment can be 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:01.380
 removed and the alignment checked with the 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:04.750
 laser alignment tool 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:06.580
 made available by gay says ovÃ­dio 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:08.800
 micro green belt replacement and 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:11.730
 accessories brings other information from 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.730
 how to do this
