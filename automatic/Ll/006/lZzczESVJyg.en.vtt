named<00:02:29.819> source<00:02:30.150> of<00:02:30.390> versions<00:02:31.400> just<00:02:32.400> to<00:02:32.549> keep

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
named source of versions just to keep

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.180 
named source of versions just to keep
track<00:02:32.970> of<00:02:33.120> what's<00:02:33.269> going<00:02:33.360> on<00:02:33.690> and<00:02:33.989> I<00:02:34.980> can

choose the timeline I want to copy from

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.119 
choose the timeline I want to copy from
now<00:02:39.000> I<00:02:39.420> originally<00:02:40.110> exported<00:02:40.709> the<00:02:40.830> remote

00:02:41.119 --> 00:02:41.129 
now I originally exported the remote

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:42.920 
now I originally exported the remote
versions<00:02:41.610> timeline<00:02:42.120> so<00:02:42.299> I'm<00:02:42.390> going<00:02:42.569> to<00:02:42.629> choose

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
versions timeline so I'm going to choose

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:44.960

color trace window appears and all I

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.220 
color trace window appears and all I
have<00:02:53.340> to<00:02:53.370> do<00:02:53.700> because<00:02:54.329> things<00:02:54.750> are<00:02:54.900> lined<00:02:55.110> up

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
have to do because things are lined up

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
you copy versions from another timeline

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.660 
you copy versions from another timeline
resolves<00:03:19.290> going<00:03:19.440> to<00:03:19.500> copy<00:03:19.829> the<00:03:20.280> correct

version for each clip but that version

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.539 
version for each clip but that version
is<00:03:24.480> going<00:03:24.900> to<00:03:25.109> become<00:03:25.470> the<00:03:25.799> new<00:03:26.010> default

timeline<00:03:30.599> you're<00:03:31.200> copying<00:03:31.440> to<00:03:32.389> so<00:03:33.389> now<00:03:33.569> you're

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
timeline you're copying to so now you're

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.259 
timeline you're copying to so now you're
going<00:03:33.870> to<00:03:33.959> get<00:03:34.079> all<00:03:34.260> the<00:03:34.380> right<00:03:34.530> grades<00:03:35.269> but

going to get all the right grades but

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:38.089 
going to get all the right grades but
those<00:03:36.630> grades<00:03:37.019> are<00:03:37.170> going<00:03:37.230> to<00:03:37.319> be<00:03:37.470> copied<00:03:37.889> in

00:03:38.089 --> 00:03:38.099 
those grades are going to be copied in

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:40.809 
those grades are going to be copied in
as<00:03:38.310> the<00:03:38.670> new<00:03:38.880> default<00:03:39.209> version<00:03:40.200> one

as the new default version one

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:43.370 
as the new default version one
furthermore<00:03:41.819> they're<00:03:42.359> going<00:03:42.630> to<00:03:42.720> be<00:03:42.840> copied

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:43.380 
furthermore they're going to be copied

happen<00:03:46.769> to<00:03:46.799> be<00:03:47.010> using<00:03:47.220> so<00:03:47.760> because<00:03:48.389> this

00:03:48.589 --> 00:03:48.599 
happen to be using so because this

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:50.839 
happen to be using so because this
timeline<00:03:49.079> was<00:03:49.319> setup<00:03:49.620> by<00:03:49.980> default<00:03:50.549> to<00:03:50.730> use

00:03:50.839 --> 00:03:50.849 
timeline was setup by default to use

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:53.479 
timeline was setup by default to use
local<00:03:51.299> versions<00:03:51.750> even<00:03:52.440> though<00:03:52.889> I<00:03:52.919> was<00:03:53.130> using

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:53.489 
local versions even though I was using

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:56.210 
local versions even though I was using
remote<00:03:53.880> versions<00:03:54.480> in<00:03:54.720> the<00:03:55.079> previous<00:03:55.560> project

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220 
remote versions in the previous project

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:59.449 
remote versions in the previous project
those<00:03:56.970> versions<00:03:57.269> are<00:03:57.720> copied<00:03:58.319> into<00:03:58.560> local

00:03:59.449 --> 00:03:59.459 
those versions are copied into local

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:01.699 
those versions are copied into local
versions<00:03:59.970> of<00:04:00.150> this<00:04:00.510> project<00:04:01.079> now<00:04:01.200> if<00:04:01.319> I<00:04:01.470> had

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:01.709 
versions of this project now if I had

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:03.500 
versions of this project now if I had
this<00:04:01.919> timeline<00:04:02.430> setup<00:04:02.880> to<00:04:03.060> use<00:04:03.090> remote

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:03.510 
this timeline setup to use remote

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:06.440 
this timeline setup to use remote
versions<00:04:04.139> instead<00:04:04.349> all<00:04:05.190> of<00:04:05.970> these<00:04:06.120> grades

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.450 
versions instead all of these grades

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:08.509 
versions instead all of these grades
would<00:04:06.750> have<00:04:06.840> been<00:04:06.989> copied<00:04:07.470> into<00:04:07.739> the<00:04:08.250> remote

00:04:08.509 --> 00:04:08.519 
would have been copied into the remote

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:11.509 
would have been copied into the remote
versions<00:04:09.349> so<00:04:10.349> it's<00:04:10.680> really<00:04:11.010> your<00:04:11.160> choice<00:04:11.190> in

fact<00:04:11.700> I'll<00:04:11.880> do<00:04:12.030> that<00:04:12.180> right<00:04:12.389> now

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810 
fact I'll do that right now

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:17.710 
fact I'll do that right now
I'll<00:04:13.440> choose<00:04:15.139> use<00:04:16.139> remote<00:04:16.530> grades<00:04:16.919> instead

00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:17.720 
I'll choose use remote grades instead

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:24.010 
I'll choose use remote grades instead
