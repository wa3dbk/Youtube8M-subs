00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:09.710
 what happens gamers welcome back 

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:11.690
 to the total rodent war a quick battle 

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:14.690
 that I'm going to play with Athens against a 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:16.759
 Seleucid enemy that I do not know in 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:18.770
 a battle that is right next to the 

00:00:16.759 --> 00:00:21.009
 sea or somewhere we will see how 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:21.009
 comes out 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:25.940
 I will try to do one thing that 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:28.850
 it has always worked out very well for me 

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:31.820
 to put hoplites and slingers then 

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:32.960
 the slingers reduce the enemy before 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:35.150
 get to the hoplites and the orbits 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:37.820
 protect the slingers let's see if 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:39.590
 we get this strategy to work 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:41.720
 with a lot of oblitas in theory its 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:44.840
 Cavalry should not be able to do anything 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:48.730
 so much of projectiles because I have a lot 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:48.730
 armor like any other type 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:54.130
 complete lightweight these are the ones in which 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:57.520
 I can not trust, they are aperson 

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:58.809
 so let's see how come come to 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:01.190
 all units of oblitas in one 

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:03.410
 single unit 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:06.860
 or rather we are going to divide it in two 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:10.430
 parts of generating a tad here 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:11.810
 is and then on the other hand not that is not 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:12.830
 the general is to generate well 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:16.909
 ok then you have two units 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:18.740
 practically the same we are already and then 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:21.790
 the slingers on the other hand by another 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:21.790
 excellent good side 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:26.650
 well let's also join the little eyes 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:28.510
 from the back 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:30.690
 I have a lot of where now with 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:33.630
 this 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:36.540
 it is not very nice what the 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.770
 Athenian armies in color molan a 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.469
 pinion 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.740
 there will start in 10 seconds we are going to 

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:42.740
 see him 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:48.880
 come on 3 2 1 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:56.280
 there we are going to see army of the 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:57.840
 enemy of what is here is the attic 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.460
 catapults it is not the best 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.670
 I could have done it but it's an increase 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:04.610
 with elephants packed behind to see 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:08.460
 what are they fixed 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:10.580
 the Greek giant list but it's not fixed 

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:13.580
 fixes us 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:17.210
 or if it is fixed it is fixed good then 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:19.880
 it has been his undoing because we see 

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:22.640
 this as you already know me I faced 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.870
 this kind of thing for a very long time 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.310
 time because I was the first to 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.710
 has spammed this type of units 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:29.630
 of catapults the typical troll battles 

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:32.210
 so just the only thing I have 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:33.860
 what to do is to leave the area and dodge 

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:35.840
 his shot has placed them all of 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:37.460
 totally central way with which 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:39.350
 with which I move a little towards a 

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:41.860
 side all your catapults will be 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:41.860
 unused 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:49.819
 ah 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:53.600
 deactivated call good because they are the 

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:55.520
 shots that will not do anything 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:58.900
 well maybe it hits something 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:58.900
 but I'm going to quickly leave the area 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:02.520
 to see all the opitas I think that they 

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:05.160
 I will give no no no all 100 advance 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:07.500
 quick what the fuck are we going to see 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:09.180
 try to go fast to the whole area on 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:12.900
 If I had been a little smart 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:16.950
 would have at least placed some of 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:19.110
 ballista in another sense that is the 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:20.910
 I would have tried to look towards the 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:25.080
 right whatever it was but you're not 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:27.269
 attacking that you pussy pussy fuck with the 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:28.830
 fucking counselor and if I know that 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:30.150
 deactivates from the main menu but 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:31.800
 when I go through the main menu what 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:34.319
 unless it occurs to me is to try 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:37.690
 solve something that should not be 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:39.990
 and which is already active in each battle 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:43.120
 come come come and out of there 

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:44.680
 maybe I will do some damage and such 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:46.660
 but then to see is that he has a 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:48.640
 army licking of balls is not creative 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:50.950
 troll of the host has taken cars 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:52.030
 he has picked elephants and he has taken those 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:54.340
 go ready 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:55.930
 then I wanted to frame me the ballista 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:57.370
 then throw the cars and if nothing 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:59.020
 it worked, I was approaching to launch 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:00.580
 elephants that is one thing that in theory 

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:01.840
 I thought about doing but never have 

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:04.810
 will still do 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:07.660
 The fact is that their cars could fall 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:11.430
 in front of my waves so silly and 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:14.609
 I just dodged all your 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:17.639
 to all the ballista then I will go 

00:04:14.609 --> 00:04:20.220
 with these surveys here and with the 

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:21.600
 you think right from behind what happens is 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:24.330
 that have run so much that the same thing already 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:27.950
 they are getting tired if they are already half 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:32.900
 Eye fatigue is worth it 

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:34.610
 decisive victory and that you've screwed up to 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:37.220
 that beacons do not work then you 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:39.860
 you're not a son of a bitch what happens is that 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:42.050
 you are a fuck to see is that to troll 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:43.520
 you have to know how to troll there is more 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:45.770
 result the male more damage but 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:47.780
 decisive victory because you've gone every 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:49.340
 or you want a shit so giving a 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:51.350
 like for this lady for example that 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:52.490
 when trimming, you have to know how to troll 

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:55.400
 or at least endure until the end 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:58.840
 this guy has not known anything like that 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:58.840
 said and until next time 

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:03.930
 yes
