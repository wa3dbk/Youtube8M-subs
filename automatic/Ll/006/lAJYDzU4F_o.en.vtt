as<00:00:52.170> we<00:00:52.409> were<00:00:52.500> coming<00:00:52.860> to<00:00:53.309> the<00:00:53.430> end<00:00:53.610> let's<00:00:54.570> get

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
as we were coming to the end let's get

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.260 
as we were coming to the end let's get
started

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.440 

at<00:01:00.330> number<00:01:01.230> one<00:01:01.410> is<00:01:01.650> the<00:01:02.040> doc<00:01:02.580> shortcut<00:01:03.120> and

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:03.450 
at number one is the doc shortcut and

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:05.540 
at number one is the doc shortcut and
this<00:01:03.870> is<00:01:03.990> actually<00:01:04.320> really<00:01:04.530> easy<00:01:04.650> what<00:01:05.430> you're

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:05.550 
this is actually really easy what you're

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:07.310 
this is actually really easy what you're
gonna<00:01:05.640> do<00:01:05.820> want<00:01:06.000> to<00:01:06.060> do<00:01:06.180> create<00:01:06.690> a<00:01:06.720> mini<00:01:06.990> turbo

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
gonna do want to do create a mini turbo

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.060 
gonna do want to do create a mini turbo
right<00:01:07.500> here<00:01:07.710> and<00:01:08.870> release<00:01:09.870> really<00:01:10.380> right

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
right here and release really right

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.380 
right here and release really right
before<00:01:11.190> the<00:01:11.430> gas<00:01:11.610> and<00:01:11.970> you<00:01:12.030> should<00:01:12.210> really

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
before the gas and you should really

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.210 
before the gas and you should really
offer<00:01:12.750> that<00:01:13.050> ramp<00:01:13.290> you<00:01:13.590> don't<00:01:13.800> want<00:01:13.950> to<00:01:14.010> trick

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
offer that ramp you don't want to trick

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.000 
offer that ramp you don't want to trick
either<00:01:14.460> mainly<00:01:15.120> because<00:01:15.450> you<00:01:16.350> can<00:01:16.530> get<00:01:16.710> a<00:01:16.740> lot

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:17.010 
either mainly because you can get a lot

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:19.219 
either mainly because you can get a lot
of<00:01:17.130> air<00:01:17.310> and<00:01:17.729> you<00:01:17.760> can<00:01:18.150> ways<00:01:18.660> easier<00:01:18.960> to<00:01:19.050> fail

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
of air and you can ways easier to fail

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.100 
of air and you can ways easier to fail
it<00:01:19.380> and<00:01:19.530> sometimes<00:01:20.130> if<00:01:20.490> the<00:01:20.850> doc<00:01:21.510> shortcut<00:01:21.990> is

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
it and sometimes if the doc shortcut is

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.320 
it and sometimes if the doc shortcut is
blocked<00:01:22.440> like<00:01:22.890> that<00:01:23.160> there's<00:01:23.760> an<00:01:23.880> alternate

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
blocked like that there's an alternate

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.359 
blocked like that there's an alternate
way<00:01:24.479> to<00:01:24.510> take<00:01:24.840> it<00:01:25.020> what<00:01:25.740> you<00:01:25.860> want<00:01:26.010> to<00:01:26.070> do<00:01:26.190> you

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
way to take it what you want to do you

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.390 
way to take it what you want to do you
want<00:01:26.550> to<00:01:26.640> drift<00:01:27.630> a<00:01:27.810> little<00:01:28.140> bit<00:01:28.290> over<00:01:28.650> and<00:01:28.860> then

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
want to drift a little bit over and then

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.760 
want to drift a little bit over and then
wheelie<00:01:29.910> on<00:01:30.150> to<00:01:30.510> the<00:01:30.630> doc<00:01:30.780> right<00:01:31.020> there<00:01:31.260> it's<00:01:31.590> a

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
wheelie on to the doc right there it's a

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.590 
wheelie on to the doc right there it's a
little<00:01:32.100> bit<00:01:32.190> more<00:01:32.340> difficult<00:01:33.000> to<00:01:33.090> master<00:01:33.240> so

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
little bit more difficult to master so

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:34.850 
little bit more difficult to master so
definitely<00:01:33.960> a<00:01:34.020> practice<00:01:34.440> is<00:01:34.560> some<00:01:34.680> time

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
definitely a practice is some time

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.340 
definitely a practice is some time
trials<00:01:35.570> number<00:01:36.570> three<00:01:36.810> is<00:01:36.990> the<00:01:37.110> double

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
trials number three is the double

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:38.870 
trials number three is the double
shortcut<00:01:37.740> which<00:01:37.920> it<00:01:38.040> assumes<00:01:38.369> which<00:01:38.610> you<00:01:38.729> want

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
shortcut which it assumes which you want

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.780 
shortcut which it assumes which you want
to<00:01:38.970> do<00:01:39.119> is<00:01:39.920> shroom<00:01:40.920> a<00:01:41.070> rate<00:01:41.369> at<00:01:41.490> the<00:01:41.580> start<00:01:41.759> of

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
to do is shroom a rate at the start of

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.670 
to do is shroom a rate at the start of
the<00:01:41.880> grass<00:01:42.090> and<00:01:42.509> then<00:01:42.690> zoom<00:01:43.080> ring<00:01:43.320> it<00:01:43.530> through

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
the grass and then zoom ring it through

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.290 
the grass and then zoom ring it through
the<00:01:43.770> mud<00:01:43.950> that<00:01:44.160> was<00:01:44.220> really<00:01:44.700> easy<00:01:44.880> as<00:01:45.090> you<00:01:45.180> can

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:45.300 
the mud that was really easy as you can

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:49.310 
the mud that was really easy as you can
see<00:01:46.580> number<00:01:47.580> four<00:01:47.940> is<00:01:48.180> a<00:01:48.210> golden<00:01:48.780> shot<00:01:49.080> what

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
see number four is a golden shot what

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.870 
see number four is a golden shot what
you're<00:01:49.470> going<00:01:49.590> to<00:01:49.619> want<00:01:50.040> to<00:01:50.100> do<00:01:50.280> is<00:01:50.520> start

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
you're going to want to do is start

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.150 
you're going to want to do is start
golden<00:01:51.240> array<00:01:51.630> before<00:01:51.750> the<00:01:51.990> boxes<00:01:52.440> and<00:01:52.740> go

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:53.160 
golden array before the boxes and go

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:54.950 
golden array before the boxes and go
right<00:01:53.369> through<00:01:53.399> the<00:01:54.030> double<00:01:54.360> this<00:01:54.509> saves<00:01:54.780> a

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
right through the double this saves a

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.540 
right through the double this saves a
