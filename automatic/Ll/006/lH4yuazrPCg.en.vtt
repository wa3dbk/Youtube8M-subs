a<00:00:34.600> moment<00:00:35.039> that<00:00:36.039> happens<00:00:36.429> when<00:00:36.579> I<00:00:36.609> think<00:00:36.820> oh<00:00:37.000> I

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:37.030 
a moment that happens when I think oh I

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:39.029 
a moment that happens when I think oh I
got<00:00:37.359> it<00:00:37.390> now<00:00:37.600> and<00:00:37.750> that's<00:00:37.989> that's<00:00:38.559> really<00:00:38.859> cool

00:00:39.029 --> 00:00:39.039 
got it now and that's that's really cool

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:44.239 
got it now and that's that's really cool
for<00:00:39.219> me<00:00:40.559> we've<00:00:41.559> had<00:00:42.339> to<00:00:42.519> think<00:00:42.699> about<00:00:42.879> our

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:44.249 
for me we've had to think about our

00:00:44.249 --> 00:00:47.689 
for me we've had to think about our
methods<00:00:45.249> of<00:00:45.579> teaching<00:00:46.030> and<00:00:46.589> try<00:00:47.589> to

00:00:47.689 --> 00:00:47.699 
methods of teaching and try to

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:51.090 
methods of teaching and try to
understand<00:00:48.699> how<00:00:49.629> we<00:00:49.690> think<00:00:50.230> is<00:00:50.410> the<00:00:50.530> best<00:00:50.769> way

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:51.100 
understand how we think is the best way

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:56.970 
understand how we think is the best way
to<00:00:51.160> teach<00:00:51.730> and<00:00:52.649> there<00:00:53.649> is<00:00:53.800> an<00:00:53.949> art<00:00:54.190> to<00:00:54.339> that<00:00:55.980> but

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:56.980 
to teach and there is an art to that but

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:00.149 
to teach and there is an art to that but
I<00:00:57.010> don't<00:00:57.339> think<00:00:57.670> that<00:00:57.760> it's<00:00:58.179> possible<00:00:58.510> to<00:00:59.159> to

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:00.159 
I don't think that it's possible to to

00:01:00.159 --> 00:01:03.000 
I don't think that it's possible to to
get<00:01:00.489> to<00:01:00.760> ever<00:01:01.359> get<00:01:01.569> there<00:01:01.780> actually<00:01:02.230> we<00:01:02.800> learn

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:03.010 
get to ever get there actually we learn

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:06.840 
get to ever get there actually we learn
about<00:01:03.839> lifelong<00:01:04.839> learning<00:01:05.470> so<00:01:06.220> the<00:01:06.369> students

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:06.850 
about lifelong learning so the students

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:08.969 
about lifelong learning so the students
are<00:01:07.090> finding<00:01:07.600> out<00:01:07.899> things<00:01:08.200> but<00:01:08.500> the<00:01:08.590> teachers

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:08.979 
are finding out things but the teachers

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:13.649 
are finding out things but the teachers
also<00:01:09.159> part<00:01:09.850> of<00:01:10.000> that<00:01:10.119> process<00:01:12.360> it<00:01:13.360> doesn't

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:13.659 
also part of that process it doesn't

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:17.700 
also part of that process it doesn't
have<00:01:13.780> to<00:01:13.960> be<00:01:13.990> just<00:01:16.140> going<00:01:17.140> into<00:01:17.320> the<00:01:17.500> forest

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:17.710 
have to be just going into the forest

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:19.560 
have to be just going into the forest
and<00:01:18.070> looking<00:01:18.670> at<00:01:18.790> trees<00:01:19.030> or<00:01:19.299> anything<00:01:19.540> like

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:19.570 
and looking at trees or anything like

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:24.590 
and looking at trees or anything like
that<00:01:19.719> it's<00:01:20.049> how<00:01:20.229> we<00:01:20.290> we<00:01:21.159> play<00:01:21.430> games<00:01:22.439> how<00:01:23.439> we

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
that it's how we we play games how we

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.050 
that it's how we we play games how we
use<00:01:25.799> different<00:01:26.799> elements<00:01:27.280> different<00:01:27.579> senses

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:28.060 
use different elements different senses

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:31.950 
use different elements different senses
to<00:01:29.280> to<00:01:30.280> get<00:01:30.880> the<00:01:31.030> students<00:01:31.420> to<00:01:31.450> understand

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:31.960 
to to get the students to understand

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:35.310 
to to get the students to understand
that's<00:01:32.189> what's<00:01:33.189> going<00:01:33.490> on<00:01:33.719> hopefully<00:01:34.719> I<00:01:34.930> think

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:35.320 
that's what's going on hopefully I think

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:39.450 
that's what's going on hopefully I think
we<00:01:35.439> should<00:01:35.469> be<00:01:35.799> thinking<00:01:36.280> about<00:01:36.539> what<00:01:38.460> the

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:39.460 
we should be thinking about what the

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:41.609 
we should be thinking about what the
students<00:01:39.909> can<00:01:40.030> get<00:01:40.180> out<00:01:40.360> of<00:01:40.570> if<00:01:40.899> they're

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:41.619 
students can get out of if they're

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:44.190 
students can get out of if they're
running<00:01:41.740> about<00:01:42.070> like<00:01:42.399> you<00:01:43.329> might<00:01:43.539> see<00:01:43.810> behind

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:44.200 
running about like you might see behind

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.550 
running about like you might see behind
me<00:01:45.060> we<00:01:46.060> have<00:01:46.090> to<00:01:46.359> have<00:01:46.450> good<00:01:46.479> reasons<00:01:47.079> to<00:01:47.200> take

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:47.560 
me we have to have good reasons to take

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.490
