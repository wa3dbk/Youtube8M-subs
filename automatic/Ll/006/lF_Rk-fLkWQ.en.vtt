everything<00:02:06.930> this<00:02:07.500> one<00:02:07.740> definitely<00:02:08.220> attracted

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
everything this one definitely attracted

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.999 
everything this one definitely attracted
me<00:02:08.879> straightaway<00:02:09.330> it<00:02:09.780> is<00:02:10.140> literally<00:02:10.440> a<00:02:10.560> dual

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
me straightaway it is literally a dual

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.250 
me straightaway it is literally a dual
layer<00:02:11.280> piece<00:02:11.610> that<00:02:11.879> is<00:02:12.120> built-in

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
layer piece that is built-in

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:14.750 
layer piece that is built-in
can<00:02:13.379> just<00:02:13.500> stick<00:02:13.739> it<00:02:13.860> into<00:02:13.980> the<00:02:14.159> front<00:02:14.370> of<00:02:14.610> the

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
can just stick it into the front of the

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.910 
can just stick it into the front of the
microphone<00:02:14.939> and<00:02:15.510> it<00:02:15.629> works<00:02:15.870> extremely<00:02:16.170> well

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
microphone and it works extremely well

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.100 
microphone and it works extremely well
like<00:02:17.579> I<00:02:17.700> said<00:02:17.879> it<00:02:18.000> is<00:02:18.030> dual<00:02:18.450> layered<00:02:18.810> so<00:02:19.079> it

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
like I said it is dual layered so it

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.380 
like I said it is dual layered so it
does<00:02:19.290> a<00:02:19.319> very<00:02:19.409> good<00:02:19.799> job<00:02:19.860> of<00:02:20.340> blocking<00:02:20.790> out<00:02:21.180> the

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
does a very good job of blocking out the

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.690 
does a very good job of blocking out the
popping<00:02:21.900> sound<00:02:21.930> the<00:02:22.769> shock<00:02:23.010> mount<00:02:23.220> is<00:02:23.340> also

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
popping sound the shock mount is also

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.390 
popping sound the shock mount is also
very<00:02:24.030> high-end<00:02:24.480> is<00:02:24.689> an<00:02:24.900> SMR<00:02:25.470> external<00:02:26.129> shock

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
very high-end is an SMR external shock

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
great very convenient setup that I've

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.649 
great very convenient setup that I've
haven't<00:02:58.920> had<00:02:59.190> any<00:02:59.400> problems<00:02:59.760> with<00:02:59.849> as<00:03:00.239> of<00:03:00.480> now

00:03:00.649 --> 00:03:00.659 
haven't had any problems with as of now

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:02.539 
haven't had any problems with as of now
and<00:03:00.930> the<00:03:01.200> sound<00:03:01.440> quality<00:03:01.560> is<00:03:01.980> great<00:03:02.250> that

00:03:02.539 --> 00:03:02.549 
and the sound quality is great that

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:04.369 
and the sound quality is great that
pretty<00:03:02.730> much<00:03:02.849> goes<00:03:03.120> without<00:03:03.420> saying<00:03:03.840> at<00:03:04.109> first

00:03:04.369 --> 00:03:04.379 
pretty much goes without saying at first

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:06.229 
pretty much goes without saying at first
I<00:03:04.500> did<00:03:04.680> find<00:03:04.920> it<00:03:05.040> to<00:03:05.159> have<00:03:05.310> a<00:03:05.340> little<00:03:05.819> bit<00:03:05.940> of<00:03:05.970> a

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239 
I did find it to have a little bit of a

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:09.050 
I did find it to have a little bit of a
more<00:03:06.389> mallow<00:03:06.720> or<00:03:07.170> equity<00:03:08.129> tone<00:03:08.400> but<00:03:08.790> I<00:03:08.819> found

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
more mallow or equity tone but I found

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.390 
more mallow or equity tone but I found
it<00:03:09.269> to<00:03:09.359> be<00:03:09.389> very<00:03:09.750> clear<00:03:10.079> and<00:03:10.470> in<00:03:10.799> general<00:03:11.220> a

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
it to be very clear and in general a

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.309 
it to be very clear and in general a
very<00:03:11.639> balanced<00:03:12.090> microphone<00:03:12.659> but<00:03:13.049> also<00:03:13.200> a

00:03:13.309 --> 00:03:13.319 
very balanced microphone but also a

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:15.050 
very balanced microphone but also a
beefed<00:03:13.590> up<00:03:13.799> low<00:03:14.129> end<00:03:14.340> like<00:03:14.579> we've<00:03:14.790> seen<00:03:15.000> with

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
beefed up low end like we've seen with
