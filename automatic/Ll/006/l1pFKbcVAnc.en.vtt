 Eight 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:49.670
 It became the weight of the market price 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.800
 I am a horse 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.800
 Not a mountain 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:12.619

00:02:59.389 --> 00:03:02.389
 I hold it tight 

00:03:03.109 --> 00:03:04.709
 But finished 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:07.709
 Jack served 

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:15.889
 February blunder 

00:03:15.889 --> 00:03:21.199

 h.323 19.6 that is trying to make the redstar transparent 

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:36.379

00:03:44.689 --> 00:03:49.290
 Endurance of the same area After all saying this, it means 2 ships

 6f79 in the bond because you are missing 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:58.650
 Seconds 5 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:01.429

 The closing price is east face in the sense that 827 people are 40 times higher than the previous day at $ 410

 Stb-like results being used as waiting for the market 

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:15.019

 Iwate is bought very much 

00:04:34.529 --> 00:04:36.969
