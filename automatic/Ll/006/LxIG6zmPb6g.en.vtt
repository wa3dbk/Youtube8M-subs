on<00:00:54.539> what<00:00:54.840> I<00:00:54.870> think<00:00:55.199> was<00:00:55.320> interesting<00:00:55.469> is<00:00:55.920> 20%

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
on what I think was interesting is 20%

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.540 
on what I think was interesting is 20%
of<00:00:57.149> I<00:00:57.270> believe<00:00:57.420> it<00:00:57.539> was<00:00:57.600> 13-year<00:00:58.170> olds<00:00:58.489> 20%<00:00:59.489> of

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
of I believe it was 13-year olds 20% of

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.040 
of I believe it was 13-year olds 20% of
the<00:00:59.609> sample<00:00:59.910> was<00:01:00.030> considered<00:01:00.420> the<00:01:00.539> cool<00:01:00.750> kids

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
the sample was considered the cool kids

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.830 
the sample was considered the cool kids
which<00:01:01.710> I<00:01:01.829> that's<00:01:02.219> how<00:01:02.399> I<00:01:02.940> think<00:01:03.239> cool<00:01:03.570> kids

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
which I that's how I think cool kids

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.350 
which I that's how I think cool kids
were<00:01:03.960> like<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.170> top<00:01:04.379> 5%<00:01:04.890> or<00:01:05.580> 10%<00:01:05.610> a<00:01:06.030> lot<00:01:06.180> of

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
were like the top 5% or 10% a lot of

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.359 
were like the top 5% or 10% a lot of
hope<00:01:06.540> I<00:01:06.689> couldn't<00:01:07.140> even<00:01:07.229> make<00:01:07.409> it<00:01:07.590> in<00:01:07.740> the<00:01:07.830> 20%

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
hope I couldn't even make it in the 20%

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.850 
hope I couldn't even make it in the 20%
I<00:01:08.670> wonder<00:01:08.939> how<00:01:09.119> they<00:01:09.360> established<00:01:10.229> that<00:01:10.590> they

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
I wonder how they established that they

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.560 
I wonder how they established that they
asked<00:01:11.189> how<00:01:11.640> many<00:01:11.700> of<00:01:11.970> these<00:01:12.060> kids<00:01:12.240> are<00:01:12.390> cooling

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
definitely not doing that now either I

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.310 
definitely not doing that now either I
really<00:01:51.270> you're<00:01:51.479> not<00:01:51.630> dabbling<00:01:52.140> in

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
really you're not dabbling in

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.999 
really you're not dabbling in
delinquency<00:01:52.850> yeah<00:01:53.960> and<00:01:54.960> then<00:01:55.200> as<00:01:55.439> they<00:01:55.770> turn

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
delinquency yeah and then as they turn

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.039 
delinquency yeah and then as they turn
23<00:01:56.490> they<00:01:56.939> got<00:01:57.060> to<00:01:57.180> the<00:01:57.270> end<00:01:57.420> of<00:01:57.659> this<00:01:57.750> study

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
23 they got to the end of this study

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.499 
23 they got to the end of this study
they<00:01:58.290> had<00:01:58.409> a<00:01:58.490> 45%<00:01:59.490> greater<00:01:59.759> rate<00:02:00.000> of<00:02:00.030> province

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
they had a 45% greater rate of province

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.149 
they had a 45% greater rate of province
resulting<00:02:00.960> from<00:02:01.049> alcohol<00:02:01.530> and<00:02:01.680> marijuana<00:02:01.829> use

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
resulting from alcohol and marijuana use

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.940 
resulting from alcohol and marijuana use
and<00:02:02.579> a<00:02:02.850> 40%<00:02:03.479> higher<00:02:03.600> level<00:02:03.930> of<00:02:04.049> actual<00:02:04.530> use<00:02:04.560> of

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
and a 40% higher level of actual use of

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.319 
and a 40% higher level of actual use of
these<00:02:05.070> substances<00:02:05.280> now<00:02:05.820> you<00:02:05.969> can<00:02:06.119> rate

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
these substances now you can rate

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:07.550 
these substances now you can rate
whether<00:02:06.540> or<00:02:06.689> not<00:02:06.750> you<00:02:06.899> think<00:02:06.930> using<00:02:07.439> marijuana

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
whether or not you think using marijuana

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:08.719 
whether or not you think using marijuana
is<00:02:07.799> an<00:02:07.890> actual<00:02:08.129> problem<00:02:08.280> but<00:02:08.520> it<00:02:08.610> does

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
is an actual problem but it does

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.760 
is an actual problem but it does
actually<00:02:08.879> show<00:02:09.179> up<00:02:09.360> they<00:02:09.959> also<00:02:10.110> had<00:02:10.319> a<00:02:10.349> 22

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
actually show up they also had a 22

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.500 
actually show up they also had a 22
percent<00:02:10.920> greater<00:02:11.280> rate<00:02:11.520> of<00:02:11.670> adult<00:02:12.030> criminal

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
percent greater rate of adult criminal

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.130 
percent greater rate of adult criminal
behaved

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
behaved

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.850 
behaved
from<00:02:13.470> theft<00:02:13.739> to<00:02:14.040> assaults<00:02:14.790> and<00:02:14.970> interestingly

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
from theft to assaults and interestingly

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:18.979 
from theft to assaults and interestingly
these<00:02:16.860> symptoms<00:02:17.730> of<00:02:18.090> pseudo<00:02:18.480> maturity

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:18.989 
these symptoms of pseudo maturity

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:21.289 
these symptoms of pseudo maturity
earlier<00:02:19.379> on<00:02:19.650> are<00:02:20.099> actually<00:02:20.549> have<00:02:20.909> a<00:02:20.940> greater

00:02:21.289 --> 00:02:21.299 
earlier on are actually have a greater

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:23.509 
earlier on are actually have a greater
correlation<00:02:22.019> with<00:02:22.200> later<00:02:22.530> drug<00:02:22.920> use<00:02:23.099> in<00:02:23.340> life

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:23.519 
correlation with later drug use in life

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:26.809 
correlation with later drug use in life
than<00:02:23.970> early<00:02:24.569> drug<00:02:24.870> use<00:02:25.110> does<00:02:25.409> so<00:02:26.159> like<00:02:26.459> nerds

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:26.819 
than early drug use does so like nerds

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:28.910 
than early drug use does so like nerds
who<00:02:27.090> do<00:02:27.209> drugs<00:02:27.420> early<00:02:27.780> on<00:02:27.930> are<00:02:28.319> likely<00:02:28.650> to<00:02:28.769> give

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
who do drugs early on are likely to give

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.949 
who do drugs early on are likely to give
it<00:02:29.010> up<00:02:29.129> rather<00:02:29.400> than<00:02:29.730> like<00:02:30.000> cool<00:02:30.629> kids<00:02:30.840> who

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
it up rather than like cool kids who

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:32.600 
it up rather than like cool kids who
don't<00:02:31.170> do<00:02:31.379> drugs<00:02:31.650> they're<00:02:32.159> more<00:02:32.340> like<00:02:32.489> they'd

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
don't do drugs they're more like they'd

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.460 
don't do drugs they're more like they'd
end<00:02:32.760> up<00:02:32.819> with<00:02:32.940> a<00:02:32.970> drug<00:02:33.150> that<00:02:33.510> is<00:02:33.870> so

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
end up with a drug that is so

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.940 
end up with a drug that is so
interesting<00:02:35.090> also<00:02:36.090> I<00:02:36.120> mean<00:02:36.390> I<00:02:36.659> think<00:02:37.409> you<00:02:37.829> know

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
interesting also I mean I think you know

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:39.500 
interesting also I mean I think you know
that<00:02:38.069> obviously<00:02:38.220> we're<00:02:38.670> talking<00:02:38.819> about<00:02:39.090> 13

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
that obviously we're talking about 13

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.000 
that obviously we're talking about 13
year<00:02:39.629> olds<00:02:39.780> in<00:02:39.840> 23<00:02:40.230> but<00:02:40.349> I<00:02:40.409> also<00:02:40.560> think<00:02:40.920> this

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
year olds in 23 but I also think this

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.339 
year olds in 23 but I also think this
takes<00:02:41.250> place<00:02:41.659> this<00:02:42.659> you<00:02:42.930> can<00:02:43.110> see<00:02:43.230> this

00:02:43.339 --> 00:02:43.349 
takes place this you can see this

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:45.110 
takes place this you can see this
pattern<00:02:43.560> even<00:02:43.799> later<00:02:44.099> in<00:02:44.310> life<00:02:44.489> like<00:02:44.760> I<00:02:44.879> think

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
pattern even later in life like I think

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.630 
pattern even later in life like I think
oh<00:02:45.209> yeah<00:02:45.540> College<00:02:46.109> I<00:02:46.230> think<00:02:46.500> the<00:02:46.950> people<00:02:47.129> you

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
oh yeah College I think the people you

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.729 
oh yeah College I think the people you
see<00:02:47.879> we've<00:02:48.180> talked<00:02:48.390> a<00:02:48.480> lot<00:02:48.629> about<00:02:48.750> people<00:02:49.590> who

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:49.739

to<00:03:08.909> be<00:03:09.060> in<00:03:09.209> the<00:03:09.239> popular<00:03:09.720> I've<00:03:09.989> been<00:03:10.170> going<00:03:10.620> to

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
to be in the popular I've been going to

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.339 
to be in the popular I've been going to
do<00:03:10.890> things<00:03:11.220> that<00:03:11.489> that<00:03:11.730> messes<00:03:12.329> up<00:03:12.359> not<00:03:12.959> only

00:03:13.339 --> 00:03:13.349 
do things that that messes up not only

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:15.050 
do things that that messes up not only
you<00:03:13.980> know<00:03:14.129> whatever<00:03:14.370> you're<00:03:14.670> doing<00:03:14.909> at<00:03:15.030> that

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
you know whatever you're doing at that

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.030 
you know whatever you're doing at that
time<00:03:15.420> but<00:03:15.599> later<00:03:15.840> in<00:03:16.079> life<00:03:16.319> think<00:03:16.650> it<00:03:16.799> makes

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
time but later in life think it makes

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:18.740 
time but later in life think it makes
that<00:03:17.220> pattern<00:03:17.609> and<00:03:17.760> it<00:03:17.910> can<00:03:18.060> really<00:03:18.299> screw<00:03:18.450> you

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
that pattern and it can really screw you

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:20.089 
that pattern and it can really screw you
up<00:03:18.840> yeah<00:03:19.230> if<00:03:19.440> you're<00:03:19.560> putting<00:03:19.829> all<00:03:19.919> of<00:03:19.950> your

00:03:20.089 --> 00:03:20.099 
up yeah if you're putting all of your

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:21.530 
up yeah if you're putting all of your
time<00:03:20.280> into<00:03:20.489> that<00:03:20.609> stuff<00:03:20.940> there's<00:03:21.150> other<00:03:21.299> stuff

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
time into that stuff there's other stuff

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.180 
time into that stuff there's other stuff
that<00:03:21.569> you're<00:03:21.810> not<00:03:21.930> putting<00:03:22.049> your<00:03:22.200> time<00:03:22.319> now

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
that you're not putting your time now

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:25.729 
that you're not putting your time now
why<00:03:23.730> is<00:03:24.120> there<00:03:24.510> this<00:03:24.690> link<00:03:25.019> between<00:03:25.230> being

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:25.739 
why is there this link between being

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:26.750 
why is there this link between being
cool<00:03:25.980> and<00:03:26.099> you're<00:03:26.190> younger<00:03:26.340> and<00:03:26.430> having<00:03:26.700> the

that helps you then go on and build

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:00.970 
that helps you then go on and build
other<00:06:59.660> relationship<00:07:00.170> because<00:07:00.380> you<00:07:00.440> learned

00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:00.980 
other relationship because you learned
