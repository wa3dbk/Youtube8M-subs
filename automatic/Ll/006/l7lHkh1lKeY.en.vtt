it'll hold the end of the sandpaper well
you<00:00:29.279> know<00:00:29.400> I<00:00:29.429> can<00:00:29.730> tell<00:00:29.939> that<00:00:29.970> it's<00:00:30.449> holding<00:00:30.750> it

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
you know I can tell that it's holding it

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.540 
you know I can tell that it's holding it
plenty<00:00:31.289> strong<00:00:31.470> enough<00:00:31.590> so<00:00:32.009> the<00:00:32.219> way<00:00:32.340> I'm

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
plenty strong enough so the way I'm

plenty strong enough so the way I'm
going<00:00:32.669> to<00:00:32.730> hold<00:00:32.910> it<00:00:33.120> on<00:00:33.300> this<00:00:33.480> little<00:00:33.719> simple

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
going to hold it on this little simple

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.479 
going to hold it on this little simple
machine<00:00:34.350> is<00:00:34.530> I'm<00:00:34.649> just<00:00:34.680> going<00:00:34.980> to<00:00:35.040> drill

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
machine is I'm just going to drill

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.250 
machine is I'm just going to drill
I<00:00:35.520> just<00:00:35.969> pre-drill<00:00:36.450> the<00:00:36.540> hole<00:00:36.719> and<00:00:36.960> just<00:00:37.140> a

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
I just pre-drill the hole and just a

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.830 
I just pre-drill the hole and just a
flat-headed<00:00:37.530> screw<00:00:38.070> so<00:00:38.340> you<00:00:38.790> know<00:00:38.940> holding

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
flat-headed screw so you know holding

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.330 
flat-headed screw so you know holding
onto<00:00:39.989> the<00:00:40.230> end<00:00:40.260> of<00:00:40.410> the<00:00:40.469> sandpaper<00:00:40.890> here<00:00:41.160> and

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
onto the end of the sandpaper here and

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.819 
onto the end of the sandpaper here and
one<00:00:42.059> holding<00:00:42.809> the<00:00:42.870> other<00:00:43.020> way<00:00:43.170> so<00:00:43.230> all<00:00:43.559> I<00:00:43.590> got

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
one holding the other way so all I got

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:49.069 
one holding the other way so all I got
to<00:00:43.950> do<00:00:44.040> is<00:00:44.309> is<00:00:44.539> is<00:00:46.039> once<00:00:47.039> I<00:00:47.219> get<00:00:47.430> my<00:00:47.640> angle<00:00:48.270> so

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
to do is is is once I get my angle so

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:50.630 
to do is is is once I get my angle so
that<00:00:49.110> I<00:00:49.260> can<00:00:49.559> cut<00:00:49.800> this<00:00:49.980> piece<00:00:50.190> of<00:00:50.370> sandpaper

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
that I can cut this piece of sandpaper

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.060 
that I can cut this piece of sandpaper
then<00:00:51.510> all<00:00:51.780> I'll<00:00:51.960> have<00:00:52.110> to<00:00:52.230> do<00:00:52.350> is<00:00:52.559> just<00:00:52.829> start

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
then all I'll have to do is just start

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.500 
then all I'll have to do is just start
it<00:00:53.219> on<00:00:53.309> this<00:00:53.550> end<00:00:53.760> I'm<00:00:53.850> going<00:00:54.030> to<00:00:54.090> draw<00:00:54.239> a<00:00:54.270> line

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
it on this end I'm going to draw a line

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.299 
it on this end I'm going to draw a line
on<00:00:54.809> my<00:00:54.930> drum<00:00:55.199> that<00:00:55.350> I<00:00:55.410> can<00:00:55.649> follow<00:00:55.829> to<00:00:55.949> get<00:00:56.160> it

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
on my drum that I can follow to get it

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.520 
on my drum that I can follow to get it
started<00:00:56.550> and<00:00:56.850> then<00:00:57.570> I'll<00:00:57.809> just<00:00:57.989> have<00:00:58.199> to<00:00:58.350> pull

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
started and then I'll just have to pull

00:00:58.530 --> 00:00:59.990 
started and then I'll just have to pull
it<00:00:58.649> tight<00:00:58.859> and<00:00:59.070> when<00:00:59.219> I<00:00:59.250> get<00:00:59.520> to<00:00:59.609> the<00:00:59.730> end<00:00:59.820> just

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
it tight and when I get to the end just

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.240 
it tight and when I get to the end just
put<00:01:00.270> the<00:01:00.899> other<00:01:01.079> screw<00:01:01.410> in<00:01:01.559> the<00:01:01.680> other<00:01:01.829> end<00:01:02.100> and

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
put the other screw in the other end and

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.759 
put the other screw in the other end and
the<00:01:03.000> way<00:01:03.120> that<00:01:03.329> I<00:01:03.420> found<00:01:03.660> this<00:01:03.989> angle<00:01:04.409> is<00:01:04.530> is

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
the way that I found this angle is is

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.560 
the way that I found this angle is is
when<00:01:04.979> you<00:01:05.129> build<00:01:05.309> one<00:01:05.549> of<00:01:05.700> these<00:01:05.790> if<00:01:06.090> you<00:01:06.360> build

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
when you build one of these if you build

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.899 
when you build one of these if you build
one<00:01:06.689> then<00:01:07.590> when<00:01:08.310> you<00:01:08.430> go<00:01:08.549> to<00:01:08.610> put<00:01:08.790> the

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
one then when you go to put the

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.640 
one then when you go to put the
sandpaper<00:01:09.360> on<00:01:09.450> you'll<00:01:09.780> be<00:01:09.840> able<00:01:10.110> to<00:01:10.200> start<00:01:10.439> in

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
sandpaper on you'll be able to start in

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.380 
sandpaper on you'll be able to start in
the<00:01:10.740> middle<00:01:11.040> and<00:01:11.159> get<00:01:11.430> it<00:01:11.580> wrapping<00:01:12.060> so<00:01:12.240> that

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
the middle and get it wrapping so that

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.060 
the middle and get it wrapping so that
it's<00:01:12.570> wrapping<00:01:13.020> tight<00:01:13.229> and<00:01:13.470> lining<00:01:13.950> up<00:01:14.040> with

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
it's wrapping tight and lining up with

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.130 
it's wrapping tight and lining up with
each<00:01:14.310> other<00:01:14.430> and<00:01:14.700> there's<00:01:15.210> only<00:01:15.390> one<00:01:15.689> angle

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
each other and there's only one angle

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.890 
each other and there's only one angle
that<00:01:16.259> this<00:01:16.439> will<00:01:16.680> wrap<00:01:16.890> at<00:01:17.130> it's<00:01:17.369> a<00:01:17.689> you'll<00:01:18.689> see

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
that this will wrap at it's a you'll see

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.300 
that this will wrap at it's a you'll see
what<00:01:19.049> I<00:01:19.080> mean<00:01:19.320> when<00:01:19.560> you<00:01:19.650> start<00:01:19.920> to<00:01:20.070> do<00:01:20.159> it

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
what I mean when you start to do it

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:21.980 
what I mean when you start to do it
it'll<00:01:20.520> just<00:01:20.549> it'll<00:01:20.850> go<00:01:21.240> tight<00:01:21.540> and<00:01:21.810> it'll

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
it'll just it'll go tight and it'll

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.590 
it'll just it'll go tight and it'll
wraps<00:01:22.320> tight<00:01:23.310> together<00:01:23.520> and<00:01:23.880> then<00:01:24.330> when<00:01:24.509> you

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
wraps tight together and then when you

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:25.789 
wraps tight together and then when you
get<00:01:24.720> to<00:01:24.780> the<00:01:24.960> end<00:01:25.110> of<00:01:25.229> the<00:01:25.290> drum<00:01:25.470> you'll<00:01:25.650> just

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
get to the end of the drum you'll just

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.200 
get to the end of the drum you'll just
be<00:01:25.950> able<00:01:26.100> to<00:01:26.189> hold<00:01:26.369> it<00:01:26.549> and<00:01:26.640> let<00:01:26.729> it<00:01:26.880> run<00:01:27.030> over

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
be able to hold it and let it run over

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.370 
be able to hold it and let it run over
the<00:01:27.299> end<00:01:27.420> then<00:01:27.570> you'll<00:01:27.689> just<00:01:27.840> be<00:01:27.960> able<00:01:28.020> to<00:01:28.110> trim

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
the end then you'll just be able to trim

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.890 
the end then you'll just be able to trim
it<00:01:28.500> off<00:01:28.619> with<00:01:29.280> a<00:01:29.310> knife<00:01:29.520> like<00:01:29.790> I<00:01:29.970> did<00:01:30.180> and<00:01:30.720> then

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
it off with a knife like I did and then

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.899 
it off with a knife like I did and then
once<00:01:31.110> you<00:01:31.259> have<00:01:31.500> that<00:01:31.799> angle<00:01:32.369> then<00:01:32.549> the<00:01:32.670> next

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
once you have that angle then the next

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.310 
once you have that angle then the next
time<00:01:33.090> you<00:01:33.240> make<00:01:33.420> a<00:01:33.450> new<00:01:33.570> piece<00:01:33.869> of<00:01:33.900> sandpaper

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
time you make a new piece of sandpaper

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.130 
time you make a new piece of sandpaper
you'll<00:01:34.770> just<00:01:34.950> be<00:01:35.100> able<00:01:35.250> to<00:01:35.369> use<00:01:35.520> this<00:01:35.790> as<00:01:36.030> a

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:36.140 
you'll just be able to use this as a

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.210 
you'll just be able to use this as a
template<00:01:37.140> you'll<00:01:37.320> just<00:01:37.530> take<00:01:37.770> this<00:01:37.950> off<00:01:38.189> and

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
template you'll just take this off and

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.999 
template you'll just take this off and
just<00:01:38.579> cut<00:01:38.790> that<00:01:38.939> same<00:01:39.380> angle<00:01:40.380> off<00:01:40.500> the<00:01:40.650> end<00:01:40.799> and

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
just cut that same angle off the end and

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.859 
just cut that same angle off the end and
then<00:01:41.130> everything<00:01:41.640> will<00:01:41.820> go<00:01:42.210> the<00:01:42.390> same<00:01:42.600> way

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
then everything will go the same way

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.980 
then everything will go the same way
next<00:01:43.710> time<00:01:44.040> so<00:01:44.430> I<00:01:44.729> was<00:01:45.329> a<00:01:45.360> little<00:01:45.659> worried<00:01:45.960> that

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
next time so I was a little worried that

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.690 
next time so I was a little worried that
this<00:01:46.619> thing<00:01:46.860> it<00:01:47.009> might<00:01:47.159> throw<00:01:47.430> it<00:01:47.579> at<00:01:47.670> a

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
this thing it might throw it at a

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.190 
this thing it might throw it at a
balance<00:01:48.149> a<00:01:48.210> little<00:01:48.450> bit<00:01:48.540> by<00:01:48.689> putting<00:01:48.720> these

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
balance a little bit by putting these

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.380 
balance a little bit by putting these
screws<00:01:49.500> in<00:01:49.680> here<00:01:49.890> but<00:01:50.070> it<00:01:50.159> doesn't<00:01:50.189> seem<00:01:50.700> to

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
screws in here but it doesn't seem to

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.870 
screws in here but it doesn't seem to
I've<00:01:51.540> heard<00:01:51.750> any<00:01:51.960> I've<00:01:52.649> done<00:01:52.920> a<00:01:52.950> little<00:01:53.549> bit<00:01:53.790> of

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
I've heard any I've done a little bit of

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.630 
I've heard any I've done a little bit of
testing<00:01:54.270> and<00:01:54.450> try<00:01:54.540> to<00:01:54.600> done<00:01:55.170> a<00:01:55.200> few<00:01:55.430> takes<00:01:56.430> on

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
testing and try to done a few takes on

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.389 
testing and try to done a few takes on
this<00:01:56.850> and<00:01:57.380> and<00:01:58.380> it's<00:01:58.770> not<00:01:58.890> throwing<00:01:59.250> it<00:01:59.340> out

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
this and and it's not throwing it out

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.399 
this and and it's not throwing it out
any<00:01:59.610> the<00:02:00.060> only<00:02:00.270> other<00:02:00.390> thing<00:02:00.630> I<00:02:00.719> might<00:02:00.990> do<00:02:01.200> is

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
any the only other thing I might do is

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.039 
any the only other thing I might do is
rate<00:02:02.130> opposite<00:02:02.729> of<00:02:02.820> this<00:02:02.939> screw<00:02:03.299> I<00:02:03.479> might<00:02:03.810> put

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
rate opposite of this screw I might put

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:05.539 
rate opposite of this screw I might put
another<00:02:04.350> screw<00:02:04.590> and<00:02:04.829> then<00:02:04.920> it<00:02:05.070> will<00:02:05.189> totally

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
another screw and then it will totally

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.340 
another screw and then it will totally
balance<00:02:05.880> it<00:02:05.969> in<00:02:06.060> the<00:02:06.149> same<00:02:06.329> thing<00:02:06.600> on<00:02:06.780> this

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
balance it in the same thing on this

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.979 
balance it in the same thing on this
side<00:02:07.409> is<00:02:07.950> rate<00:02:08.759> opposite<00:02:09.239> that<00:02:09.330> this<00:02:09.450> screw<00:02:09.720> is

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
side is rate opposite that this screw is

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:11.390 
side is rate opposite that this screw is
put<00:02:10.229> another<00:02:10.319> screw<00:02:10.770> and<00:02:10.950> then<00:02:11.039> that<00:02:11.220> would

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
put another screw and then that would

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.920 
put another screw and then that would
balance<00:02:11.670> it<00:02:11.940> back<00:02:12.090> out<00:02:12.300> because<00:02:12.420> this<00:02:12.690> drum

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
balance it back out because this drum

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:13.610 
balance it back out because this drum
was

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
was

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.789 
was
very<00:02:14.040> well-balanced<00:02:14.819> so<00:02:15.180> I<00:02:15.480> also<00:02:16.140> picked<00:02:16.560> up<00:02:16.650> a

00:02:16.789 --> 00:02:16.799 
very well-balanced so I also picked up a

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:18.440 
very well-balanced so I also picked up a
few<00:02:16.830> more<00:02:17.010> parts<00:02:17.580> here<00:02:17.730> I<00:02:17.760> got<00:02:18.030> a<00:02:18.060> few<00:02:18.269> pieces

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
few more parts here I got a few pieces

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.619 
few more parts here I got a few pieces
of<00:02:18.750> threaded<00:02:19.080> rod<00:02:19.260> and<00:02:19.590> I<00:02:19.650> got<00:02:19.890> a<00:02:19.920> few<00:02:20.190> of<00:02:20.220> these

00:02:20.619 --> 00:02:20.629 
of threaded rod and I got a few of these

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:23.539 
of threaded rod and I got a few of these
jointer<00:02:21.629> nuts<00:02:21.989> they're<00:02:22.230> called<00:02:22.470> which<00:02:23.370> I'm

00:02:23.539 --> 00:02:23.549 
jointer nuts they're called which I'm

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:25.190 
jointer nuts they're called which I'm
not<00:02:23.670> even<00:02:23.730> sure<00:02:24.090> I'm<00:02:24.209> going<00:02:24.330> to<00:02:24.450> use<00:02:24.599> in<00:02:24.810> a<00:02:24.989> few

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
not even sure I'm going to use in a few

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.339 
not even sure I'm going to use in a few
little<00:02:25.530> compression<00:02:26.099> springs<00:02:26.670> that<00:02:27.319> that<00:02:28.319> I

00:02:28.339 --> 00:02:28.349 
little compression springs that that I

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:29.720 
little compression springs that that I
think<00:02:28.500> I'm<00:02:28.739> going<00:02:28.860> to<00:02:28.920> use<00:02:29.099> for<00:02:29.340> the<00:02:29.430> rollers

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
think I'm going to use for the rollers

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.100 
think I'm going to use for the rollers
because<00:02:29.879> they'll<00:02:30.209> obviously<00:02:30.420> have<00:02:30.840> to<00:02:30.959> be<00:02:30.989> a

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
because they'll obviously have to be a

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.319 
because they'll obviously have to be a
little<00:02:31.319> spring-loaded<00:02:31.680> the<00:02:32.220> feed<00:02:32.730> rollers<00:02:33.150> on

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:33.329 
little spring-loaded the feed rollers on

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:36.410 
little spring-loaded the feed rollers on
this<00:02:33.569> because<00:02:34.430> they<00:02:35.430> just<00:02:35.879> need<00:02:36.090> a<00:02:36.120> little<00:02:36.180> bit

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
this because they just need a little bit

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:37.850 
this because they just need a little bit
of<00:02:36.510> give<00:02:36.629> you<00:02:36.780> don't<00:02:37.019> want<00:02:37.200> any<00:02:37.409> give<00:02:37.590> in<00:02:37.739> your

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
of give you don't want any give in your

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:39.380 
of give you don't want any give in your
head<00:02:38.040> but<00:02:38.280> little<00:02:38.610> feed<00:02:38.790> rollers<00:02:39.150> you

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
head but little feed rollers you

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.350 
head but little feed rollers you
definitely<00:02:40.260> want<00:02:40.470> a<00:02:40.620> little<00:02:40.650> giving<00:02:41.220> them<00:02:41.430> so

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
definitely want a little giving them so

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.569 
definitely want a little giving them so

what I'll do now is I'll just start this

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:46.970 
what I'll do now is I'll just start this
up<00:02:44.760> and<00:02:44.940> I'll<00:02:45.090> do<00:02:45.299> just<00:02:45.959> a<00:02:46.079> little<00:02:46.109> wee<00:02:46.470> bit<00:02:46.950> of

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
up and I'll do just a little wee bit of

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.910 
up and I'll do just a little wee bit of
sand<00:02:47.280> and<00:02:47.489> I'm<00:02:47.549> amazed<00:02:47.819> how<00:02:48.030> much<00:02:48.209> this<00:02:48.920> 1/3

know will have a thickness sander when

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:04.140 
know will have a thickness sander when
this<00:04:02.530> is<00:04:02.680> done<00:04:02.829> with<00:04:03.370> them<00:04:03.549> other<00:04:03.730> ones<00:04:03.909> which

is running across the top then you know
we<00:04:06.069> could<00:04:06.220> sand<00:04:06.459> something<00:04:06.730> smooth<00:04:07.090> but<00:04:07.389> if<00:04:07.599> we

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:08.109 
we could sand something smooth but if we

00:04:08.109 --> 00:04:09.479 
we could sand something smooth but if we
want<00:04:08.319> to<00:04:08.409> make<00:04:08.530> a<00:04:08.560> top<00:04:08.919> or<00:04:09.159> something<00:04:09.400> like

want to make a top or something like
that<00:04:09.549> or<00:04:10.319> you<00:04:11.319> know<00:04:11.439> this<00:04:12.099> thing<00:04:12.340> would<00:04:12.549> act<00:04:12.730> as

00:04:12.929 --> 00:04:12.939 
that or you know this thing would act as

00:04:12.939 --> 00:04:14.699 
that or you know this thing would act as
a<00:04:12.970> thickness<00:04:13.329> err<00:04:13.629> because<00:04:13.989> it<00:04:14.290> will<00:04:14.470> be

00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:14.709 
a thickness err because it will be

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:17.159 
a thickness err because it will be
sandwiched<00:04:15.189> between<00:04:15.310> the<00:04:15.700> table<00:04:16.359> and<00:04:16.509> the
