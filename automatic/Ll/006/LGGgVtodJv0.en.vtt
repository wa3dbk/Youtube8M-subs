it's<00:02:10.250> been<00:02:10.460> it's<00:02:11.150> gone<00:02:11.300> through<00:02:11.450> the<00:02:11.570> lacquer

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:11.780

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:14.590 
it's been it's gone through the lacquer
but<00:02:12.610> it<00:02:13.610> just<00:02:13.760> feels<00:02:13.940> like<00:02:14.090> it's<00:02:14.270> very<00:02:14.450> very

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:14.600 
but it just feels like it's very very

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.450 
but it just feels like it's very very
slightly<00:02:14.810> indented<00:02:15.020> just<00:02:15.560> around<00:02:15.800> here<00:02:16.100> but

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:16.460 
slightly indented just around here but

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:18.010 
slightly indented just around here but
so<00:02:17.210> you'd<00:02:17.300> be<00:02:17.360> hard<00:02:17.540> pushed<00:02:17.690> to<00:02:17.780> see<00:02:17.990> I

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:18.020 
so you'd be hard pushed to see I

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:19.690 
so you'd be hard pushed to see I
certainly<00:02:18.380> wouldn't<00:02:18.620> see<00:02:18.770> it<00:02:18.830> looking<00:02:19.580> at

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
certainly wouldn't see it looking at

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.910
