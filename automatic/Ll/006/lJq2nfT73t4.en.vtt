this<00:04:24.040> is<00:04:24.100> the<00:04:24.310> warmest<00:04:24.670> part<00:04:24.850> of<00:04:25.000> you<00:04:25.720> could

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:25.870 
this is the warmest part of you could

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:28.200 
this is the warmest part of you could
like<00:04:26.020> probably<00:04:26.260> head<00:04:26.650> up<00:04:26.680> and<00:04:27.040> this<00:04:27.820> one<00:04:28.030> will

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:28.210 
like probably head up and this one will

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:29.640 
like probably head up and this one will
be<00:04:28.330> a<00:04:28.360> little<00:04:28.510> lighter<00:04:28.840> just<00:04:29.140> because<00:04:29.440> it's

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:29.650 
be a little lighter just because it's

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:31.410 
be a little lighter just because it's
colder<00:04:30.070> here<00:04:30.370> and<00:04:30.580> hotter<00:04:30.760> it's<00:04:31.030> warmer<00:04:31.390> here

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:31.420 
colder here and hotter it's warmer here

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:34.860 
colder here and hotter it's warmer here
and<00:04:32.160> near<00:04:33.160> my<00:04:33.340> hips<00:04:33.580> it'll<00:04:34.180> be<00:04:34.360> a<00:04:34.570> lighter

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:34.870 
and near my hips it'll be a lighter

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:36.660 
and near my hips it'll be a lighter
color<00:04:35.170> just<00:04:35.380> because<00:04:35.590> I<00:04:36.040> don't<00:04:36.130> have<00:04:36.310> the<00:04:36.520> much

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:36.670 
color just because I don't have the much

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:40.170 
color just because I don't have the much
heat<00:04:36.970> there<00:04:37.000> um<00:04:38.310> yeah<00:04:39.310> that<00:04:39.340> everywhere<00:04:39.970> else

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:40.180 
heat there um yeah that everywhere else

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:42.330 
heat there um yeah that everywhere else
is<00:04:40.390> just<00:04:40.540> lighter<00:04:40.990> like<00:04:41.320> this<00:04:41.500> is<00:04:41.650> the<00:04:41.860> darkest

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:42.340 
is just lighter like this is the darkest

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:43.800 
is just lighter like this is the darkest
and<00:04:42.550> these<00:04:42.760> are<00:04:42.880> the<00:04:43.000> two<00:04:43.180> lightest<00:04:43.600> that<00:04:43.780> I

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:43.810 
and these are the two lightest that I

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:48.840 
and these are the two lightest that I
have<00:04:44.190> so<00:04:45.190> yeah<00:04:46.150> I<00:04:47.250> actually<00:04:48.250> thought<00:04:48.610> that

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:48.850 
have so yeah I actually thought that

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:50.340 
have so yeah I actually thought that
this<00:04:49.120> one<00:04:49.330> wasn't<00:04:49.570> going<00:04:49.870> to<00:04:49.960> work<00:04:50.140> just

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:50.350 
this one wasn't going to work just

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:52.200 
this one wasn't going to work just
because<00:04:50.530> it<00:04:50.950> was<00:04:51.040> a<00:04:51.070> my<00:04:51.280> clothes<00:04:51.490> product<00:04:51.970> and

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:52.210 
because it was a my clothes product and

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:55.280 
because it was a my clothes product and
I<00:04:52.570> was<00:04:52.690> like<00:04:52.900> oh<00:04:53.020> this<00:04:53.260> is<00:04:53.320> just<00:04:53.530> another<00:04:53.770> um

00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:57.940 
mediocre thing but actually was pretty

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:00.060 
mediocre thing but actually was pretty
pretty<00:04:58.690> well<00:04:58.780> the<00:04:59.140> only<00:04:59.350> thing<00:04:59.500> that<00:04:59.650> I<00:04:59.710> don't

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:14.500 
out of a 1 to 10 scale of how much I

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:16.020

hmm probably seven and a half just

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:22.200 
hmm probably seven and a half just
because<00:05:18.690> sometimes<00:05:19.690> um<00:05:20.820> it'll<00:05:21.820> stain<00:05:22.180> a

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:22.210 
because sometimes um it'll stain a

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:25.140 
because sometimes um it'll stain a
little<00:05:22.740> lighter<00:05:23.740> than<00:05:23.860> other<00:05:24.340> areas<00:05:24.970> of<00:05:25.060> my

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:25.150

body I did not know that and also that
it's<00:05:28.180> runny<00:05:28.720> and<00:05:29.020> you<00:05:29.230> bet<00:05:29.380> for<00:05:29.590> like

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:29.740
