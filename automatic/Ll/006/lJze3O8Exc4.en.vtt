00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:04.660
 than many people complain that 

00:00:02.169 --> 00:00:06.040
 dog put on their front paws when 

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:08.379
 they come home or when just 

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:10.780
 are played or when the dog requires 

00:00:08.379 --> 00:00:12.880
 attention for behavior on the one hand 

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:15.370
 need to be touched by people oh doggie came 

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:17.650
 cuddle or stones affectionate dog 

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:19.630
 You want the attention of the owners and strokes 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:21.460
 other hand this behavior is all and so 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:23.739
 a lot of cons and disadvantages 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:25.989
 which interferes with our normal life 

00:00:23.739 --> 00:00:28.419
 dog first fault naturally 

00:00:25.989 --> 00:00:31.419
 it's spoiling things dirty dog â€‹â€‹paws on 

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:33.670
 white clothes posts live live 2 

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:35.980
 second moment you will be able to stand paws not 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:38.289
 only on you are male guests of children and 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:40.390
 other people and this may be fraught 

00:00:38.289 --> 00:00:42.250
 consequences from startle to any 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:44.949
 fines following 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:47.050
 for me the most important dog that 

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:50.410
 puts the feet of the beginning of the century on sumo chewing 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:52.179
 don't usually take it as a leader 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:54.909
 I think that this is just a man who 

00:00:52.179 --> 00:00:57.760
 fed loves but it is not necessary 

00:00:54.909 --> 00:00:59.530
 obey the wind on has the right to put 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:01.379
 on his front are his paws perfectly 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:03.249
 calmly 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.110
 so we have to up behavior 

00:01:03.249 --> 00:01:06.579
 gradually adjust one 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:09.189
 we will correct the behavior 

00:01:06.579 --> 00:01:11.439
 let's start with the fact that the most important dog 

00:01:09.189 --> 00:01:13.390
 psychology is the most important thing that dog 

00:01:11.439 --> 00:01:16.509
 chooses the behavior that we are profitable 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:18.460
 all it is profitable for him to put on your front 

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:20.530
 paws and he gets it for what he 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:22.719
 he wants to repeat this behavior 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:25.000
 what does the dog want to deliver on you 

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:27.399
 front paws she wants attention she 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.110
 wants to communicate with you give and attention 

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:31.659
 communication is even negative it will be 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:32.229
 reinforcement and there behavior and everything will be 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:34.180
 round 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:35.979
 if you scream at the dog that is 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:37.140
 achieved what he wanted he drew on 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:40.270
 attention 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:42.009
 this should be the first problem and the solution 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:43.479
 the easiest option and the most 

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:46.090
 valid that fit all 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:48.219
 dogs without including puppies you 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:50.619
 only put on you forepaws you 

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:53.829
 turn your back to him and nothing 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:55.479
 don't talk and do one-two-three-four 

00:01:53.829 --> 00:01:57.640
 10 times some point dogs 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:59.770
 stops or sits down or stands and 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:02.109
 looks at you and at this moment you yourself 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:04.240
 lean and praise and works here 

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:07.479
 power of contrast only the dog she you 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.980
 jumped he got discomfort for nothing 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:09.640
 he does not mind at all from you and you 

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:12.430
 turned away 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:14.469
 but only the dog became and stood 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:17.200
 you praised the dog became a coin good girl 

00:02:14.469 --> 00:02:19.599
 well done this is the first moment the second moment 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.400
 when you work like that dog 

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:23.709
 understands that he can achieve your 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.719
 attention only to what he does well 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:28.209
 that is, the measure stands and looks or 

00:02:25.719 --> 00:02:30.549
 trips with a toy but it does not require 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:33.219
 so clearly your attention 

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:35.670
 it will gradually respond to your 

00:02:33.219 --> 00:02:39.340
 relationship is the first option 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:41.139
 problem solving the second option which 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:42.819
 part of everything is described in books when 

00:02:41.139 --> 00:02:44.950
 from jumping expose knee talking 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:49.150
 team there again so many 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:51.730
 dogs need not the fact that he 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:54.159
 discomfort and your attention and he even 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:55.659
 including on the knee will jump or dog 

00:02:54.159 --> 00:02:56.260
 so excited that my so 

00:02:55.659 --> 00:02:58.329
 Alenka 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:00.040
 just she does not feel and do not work 

00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:02.260
 or the farm does not have time on time 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.939
 put the knee so they did not 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:06.669
 knees forward to the niche as an option 

00:03:03.939 --> 00:03:07.810
 A pretty little option is obtained. 

00:03:06.669 --> 00:03:09.430
 once every other 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:11.680
 especially the babies ca n't 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:13.569
 take advantage of dogs just overwhelmed 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.129
 so if you want to put in front 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:17.889
 knee when the dog jumps on you 

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:21.099
 try but usually not quite 2 option 

00:03:17.889 --> 00:03:23.590
 working or you will have to do 

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:25.269
 so the dog while jumping on a pair 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:28.209
 with all the dope on your colleagues and will 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:30.519
 the series is uncomfortable then this of course 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:32.979
 work on again i say that all to 

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:33.430
 this series 100 times not fit and accounts 

00:03:32.979 --> 00:03:35.590
 Komi 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:37.780
 that the dog jumps find that in such 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:39.819
 case then do not tough on them 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:41.979
 go by jumped on the baby put 

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:44.319
 front paws dog is strong to be punished 

00:03:41.979 --> 00:03:46.030
 how much is punished i can 

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:49.000
 say hard no command take a dog 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:51.489
 at the withers trip night or press the muzzle to 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.409
 land or a little strangle should not 

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:56.530
 explain the dog once and enough 

00:03:53.409 --> 00:03:58.659
 hard what exactly is this behavior to me 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:00.819
 don't like it is complicated only by 

00:03:58.659 --> 00:04:02.979
 those dogs that are already seven eight 

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:05.079
 months and labor it went through any 

00:04:02.979 --> 00:04:07.389
 training that you tried to work on 

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:09.280
 1 method that understand what to jump on 

00:04:07.389 --> 00:04:10.750
 man can not but jump on purpose 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:14.409
 to check whether it is possible or not 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:16.630
 jump and 3 mid fourth option is very 

00:04:14.409 --> 00:04:18.519
 simple all the time very complicated you 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:21.070
 just say command sit up 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:23.490
 fits their dogs you sit down yourself 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:25.650
 bend over and introduce it to this husband 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:27.449
 work out this command to sit in all 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:29.460
 distracting moments when dogs are something 

00:04:27.449 --> 00:04:31.560
 I want to when a dog goes to I am a dog 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:33.840
 runs during the game only through 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:35.250
 month and a half of classes you immediately calm 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:37.979
 can set the team to sit 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:39.539
 the dog from jumping on you is therefore the most 

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:41.880
 simple option in my opinion is just 

00:04:39.539 --> 00:04:44.699
 turn away dogs only dog again 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:46.889
 jumped off delivering her back don't let 

00:04:44.699 --> 00:04:48.810
 no emotion i rarely see you 

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:51.509
 dogs jumped more than ten times on 

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:54.180
 host down Roslavl watched asha with 

00:04:51.509 --> 00:04:56.669
 although we studied and praised in weeks 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:59.400
 two three prizes used mascara need to drive 

00:04:56.669 --> 00:05:02.130
 he came over looked or sat down master with 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:04.169
 he played praises therefore the most important 

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:06.000
 the principle of training we replace the bad 

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:09.120
 behavior that we need 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.099
 and in this case we just ignore that 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:12.960
 what we don't like was showing the dog what 

00:05:11.099 --> 00:05:16.110
 so they will achieve that she 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:19.400
 wants to try experimenting and write 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:19.400
