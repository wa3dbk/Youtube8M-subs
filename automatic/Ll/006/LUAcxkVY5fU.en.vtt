like a cutting mat that you can get from

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.950 
like a cutting mat that you can get from
the<00:00:37.170> dollar<00:00:37.380> store<00:00:37.530> or<00:00:38.100> wherever<00:00:38.450> 50<00:00:39.450> cents

with a design on it if they want to just

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:00.500 
with a design on it if they want to just
get<00:00:59.460> started<00:00:59.699> with<00:00:59.910> that<00:01:00.210> and<00:01:00.420> you<00:01:00.480> can

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
get started with that and you can

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.369 
get started with that and you can
actually<00:01:01.020> slide<00:01:01.320> it<00:01:01.590> under<00:01:02.430> the<00:01:03.359> Plexiglas<00:01:04.080> or

actually slide it under the Plexiglas or
not<00:01:04.530> or<00:01:04.739> just<00:01:04.799> the<00:01:05.220> piece<00:01:05.430> of<00:01:05.580> plastic

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
not or just the piece of plastic

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.240 
not or just the piece of plastic
whatever<00:01:06.659> you<00:01:06.780> have<00:01:06.960> matte<00:01:07.290> and<00:01:07.590> they<00:01:08.070> can

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
whatever you have matte and they can

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.000 
whatever you have matte and they can
actually<00:01:08.430> use<00:01:08.640> that<00:01:08.909> as<00:01:09.180> a<00:01:09.420> guide<00:01:09.750> to<00:01:10.010> to

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
actually use that as a guide to to

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.340 
actually use that as a guide to to
actually<00:01:11.549> fill<00:01:11.880> in<00:01:11.909> so<00:01:12.780> basically<00:01:13.229> obviously

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
actually fill in so basically obviously

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:14.780 
actually fill in so basically obviously
they're<00:01:13.710> going<00:01:13.799> to<00:01:13.890> use<00:01:14.040> their<00:01:14.220> hands<00:01:14.490> and

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
they're going to use their hands and

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.899 
they're going to use their hands and
just<00:01:14.970> let<00:01:15.210> them<00:01:15.420> you<00:01:16.140> know<00:01:16.170> dip<00:01:16.799> in<00:01:17.040> there<00:01:17.759> and

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
just let them you know dip in there and

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.760 
just let them you know dip in there and
they<00:01:18.000> can<00:01:18.030> just<00:01:18.330> start<00:01:18.540> they<00:01:19.320> can<00:01:19.350> do<00:01:19.590> whatever

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
they can just start they can do whatever

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.440 
they can just start they can do whatever
they<00:01:20.130> want<00:01:20.159> on<00:01:20.729> here<00:01:20.970> they<00:01:21.150> can<00:01:21.270> just

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
they want on here they can just

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.420 
they want on here they can just
experiment<00:01:21.869> slide<00:01:22.740> it<00:01:22.890> all<00:01:22.979> around<00:01:23.009> health

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
experiment slide it all around health

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.070 
experiment slide it all around health
fun<00:01:23.670> with<00:01:23.880> it<00:01:24.060> it's<00:01:24.180> sort<00:01:24.330> of<00:01:24.360> like<00:01:24.450> a<00:01:24.509> sensory

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
fun with it it's sort of like a sensory

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.950 
fun with it it's sort of like a sensory
activity<00:01:25.680> to<00:01:25.890> then<00:01:26.670> add<00:01:26.970> some<00:01:27.299> red<00:01:27.540> and<00:01:27.900> they

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
activity to then add some red and they

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.890 
activity to then add some red and they
can<00:01:28.140> begin<00:01:28.500> to<00:01:28.650> see<00:01:28.829> that<00:01:29.299> red<00:01:30.299> and<00:01:30.659> yellow

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
can begin to see that red and yellow

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.560 
can begin to see that red and yellow
make<00:01:31.320> orange<00:01:31.530> for<00:01:32.490> fall<00:01:33.030> and<00:01:33.270> then<00:01:33.360> you<00:01:33.450> could

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
make orange for fall and then you could

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.359 
make orange for fall and then you could
talk<00:01:33.720> about<00:01:33.930> fall<00:01:34.200> colors<00:01:34.680> or<00:01:34.920> just<00:01:35.100> so<00:01:35.189> many

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
talk about fall colors or just so many

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:36.740 
talk about fall colors or just so many
things<00:01:35.549> you<00:01:35.640> could<00:01:35.759> do<00:01:35.909> but<00:01:36.299> anyway<00:01:36.600> they

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
things you could do but anyway they

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.450 
things you could do but anyway they
could<00:01:36.900> just<00:01:37.079> just<00:01:37.500> have<00:01:37.710> fun<00:01:37.979> with<00:01:38.040> it<00:01:38.250> they

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
could just just have fun with it they

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.420 
could just just have fun with it they
don't<00:01:38.610> really<00:01:38.729> have<00:01:38.970> to<00:01:39.150> make<00:01:39.390> anything<00:01:39.990> a

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:40.430 
don't really have to make anything a

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:43.460 
don't really have to make anything a
picture<00:01:41.430> that<00:01:41.579> you<00:01:41.700> can<00:01:41.850> recognize<00:01:42.200> so<00:01:43.200> I<00:01:43.229> mean

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
picture that you can recognize so I mean

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.139 
picture that you can recognize so I mean
if<00:01:43.560> you<00:01:43.680> want<00:01:43.950> them<00:01:44.130> to<00:01:44.250> do<00:01:44.369> that<00:01:44.399> you<00:01:44.700> can<00:01:44.909> use

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
if you want them to do that you can use

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:46.670 
if you want them to do that you can use
something<00:01:45.479> like<00:01:45.509> that<00:01:45.659> but<00:01:46.110> if<00:01:46.200> not<00:01:46.380> they<00:01:46.619> can

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
something like that but if not they can

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.340 
something like that but if not they can
just<00:01:46.920> have<00:01:47.070> fun<00:01:47.280> with<00:01:47.340> the<00:01:47.579> paint<00:01:48.110> and<00:01:49.110> just

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
just have fun with the paint and just
