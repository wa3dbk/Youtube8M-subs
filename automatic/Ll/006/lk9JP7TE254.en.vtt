so<00:00:08.250> most<00:00:08.429> of<00:00:08.550> the<00:00:08.610> new<00:00:08.790> computer<00:00:09.000> these

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
so most of the new computer these

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.320 
so most of the new computer these
computers<00:00:10.019> these<00:00:10.139> days<00:00:10.200> um<00:00:10.710> are<00:00:11.550> running<00:00:12.090> on

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
computers these days um are running on

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.600 
computers these days um are running on
Intel<00:00:13.200> processes<00:00:13.799> Intel's<00:00:14.190> pretty<00:00:14.460> big

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
Intel processes Intel's pretty big

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.670 
Intel processes Intel's pretty big
company<00:00:15.000> as<00:00:15.150> most<00:00:15.420> you've<00:00:15.630> probably<00:00:16.080> heard<00:00:16.440> of

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
company as most you've probably heard of

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.570 
company as most you've probably heard of
um<00:00:17.630> they<00:00:18.630> are<00:00:18.960> all<00:00:19.140> were<00:00:19.650> called<00:00:19.890> dual<00:00:20.189> core

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
um they are all were called dual core

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.279 
um they are all were called dual core
processes<00:00:21.300> this<00:00:21.510> is<00:00:21.689> basically<00:00:21.960> like<00:00:22.080> having

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
processes this is basically like having

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.220 
processes this is basically like having
two<00:00:22.619> processes<00:00:23.250> on<00:00:23.460> one<00:00:23.760> ship<00:00:24.000> so<00:00:24.930> a<00:00:24.960> lot<00:00:25.199> of

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
two processes on one ship so a lot of

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.640 
two processes on one ship so a lot of
the<00:00:25.470> kind<00:00:26.070> of<00:00:26.099> a<00:00:26.279> greatest<00:00:27.230> idea<00:00:28.230> of<00:00:28.289> a<00:00:28.380> super

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
the kind of a greatest idea of a super

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:29.839 
the kind of a greatest idea of a super
commuter<00:00:28.920> with<00:00:29.010> having<00:00:29.220> all<00:00:29.310> these<00:00:29.429> multiple

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
commuter with having all these multiple

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.849 
commuter with having all these multiple
processes<00:00:30.420> working<00:00:30.720> at<00:00:30.779> the<00:00:30.869> same<00:00:31.019> time<00:00:31.289> well

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
processes working at the same time well

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:33.440 
processes working at the same time well
this<00:00:32.040> point<00:00:32.250> divisions<00:00:32.640> mind<00:00:32.910> that<00:00:33.030> in<00:00:33.149> one

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
this point divisions mind that in one

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:34.850 
this point divisions mind that in one
ship<00:00:33.719> that<00:00:33.899> they<00:00:33.989> can<00:00:34.110> fit<00:00:34.290> into<00:00:34.440> something

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
ship that they can fit into something

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.280 
ship that they can fit into something
like<00:00:34.950> a<00:00:35.010> notebook<00:00:35.250> or<00:00:35.550> not<00:00:35.989> so<00:00:36.989> that<00:00:37.110> allows

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
like a notebook or not so that allows

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.770 
like a notebook or not so that allows
you<00:00:37.530> a<00:00:37.800> lot<00:00:38.219> of<00:00:38.309> ability<00:00:38.460> to<00:00:38.850> for<00:00:39.480> the<00:00:39.540> computer

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
you a lot of ability to for the computer

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.119 
you a lot of ability to for the computer
to<00:00:39.930> be<00:00:40.050> doing<00:00:40.260> more<00:00:40.410> than<00:00:40.590> one<00:00:40.739> thing<00:00:40.920> at<00:00:41.040> a

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
to be doing more than one thing at a

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.180 
to be doing more than one thing at a
time<00:00:41.160> um<00:00:41.640> so<00:00:42.629> like<00:00:42.989> the<00:00:43.410> operating<00:00:43.860> system<00:00:44.100> is

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
time um so like the operating system is

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.590 
time um so like the operating system is
saying<00:00:44.760> is<00:00:44.910> always<00:00:45.180> running<00:00:45.329> in<00:00:45.539> the

your email in the background you're
playing<00:01:09.659> is<00:01:09.840> you<00:01:09.960> using<00:01:10.290> or<00:01:10.409> something<00:01:10.680> like

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
playing is you using or something like

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.370 
playing is you using or something like
that<00:01:10.909> so<00:01:11.909> you<00:01:12.180> one<00:01:12.540> thing<00:01:12.750> is<00:01:12.930> when<00:01:13.170> we<00:01:13.229> talk

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
that so you one thing is when we talk

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:14.630 
that so you one thing is when we talk
about<00:01:13.409> computers<00:01:13.979> it's<00:01:14.130> almost<00:01:14.310> that<00:01:14.460> we<00:01:14.520> have

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
about computers it's almost that we have

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.670 
about computers it's almost that we have
a<00:01:14.700> different<00:01:15.030> language<00:01:15.390> right<00:01:15.630> so<00:01:16.170> we<00:01:16.470> say

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
a different language right so we say

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.859 
a different language right so we say
dual-core<00:01:17.220> you<00:01:17.790> might<00:01:17.939> be<00:01:18.060> wondering<00:01:18.240> what's

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
dual-core you might be wondering what's

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.840 
dual-core you might be wondering what's
dual-core<00:01:19.320> does<00:01:19.619> that<00:01:19.740> mean<00:01:19.890> right<00:01:20.189> in<00:01:20.400> the

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
dual-core does that mean right in the

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.580 
dual-core does that mean right in the
past<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:21.390> processor<00:01:21.869> just<00:01:22.229> kind<00:01:22.350> of<00:01:22.380> like<00:01:22.500> the

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
past the processor just kind of like the

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.530 
past the processor just kind of like the
brain<00:01:22.860> of<00:01:22.890> the<00:01:23.100> computer<00:01:23.130> runs<00:01:24.119> at<00:01:24.270> a<00:01:24.330> certain

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
brain of the computer runs at a certain

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.780 
brain of the computer runs at a certain
speed<00:01:24.930> right<00:01:25.409> and<00:01:25.650> over<00:01:26.220> the<00:01:26.340> years<00:01:26.369> again

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
speed right and over the years again

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.359 
speed right and over the years again
faster<00:01:27.360> and<00:01:27.509> faster<00:01:27.659> and<00:01:27.930> faster<00:01:28.250> but<00:01:29.250> the

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
faster and faster and faster but the

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.190 
faster and faster and faster but the
problem<00:01:29.759> is<00:01:29.880> at<00:01:30.270> this<00:01:30.570> point<00:01:30.840> they're<00:01:31.020> getting

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
problem is at this point they're getting

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.530 
problem is at this point they're getting
so<00:01:31.409> fast<00:01:31.770> there's<00:01:32.159> not<00:01:32.280> much<00:01:32.520> more<00:01:32.759> they<00:01:33.299> can't

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
so fast there's not much more they can't

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.600 
so fast there's not much more they can't
make<00:01:33.750> the<00:01:33.960> brain<00:01:34.200> much<00:01:34.470> faster<00:01:34.979> so<00:01:35.490> what

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
make the brain much faster so what

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:36.770 
make the brain much faster so what
they're<00:01:35.759> doing<00:01:35.790> is<00:01:36.090> they're<00:01:36.150> putting<00:01:36.540> two

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
they're doing is they're putting two

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.800 
they're doing is they're putting two
brains<00:01:37.200> on<00:01:38.100> one<00:01:38.460> chip<00:01:38.759> so<00:01:39.450> that's<00:01:39.600> what<00:01:39.720> we

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
brains on one chip so that's what we

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.719 
brains on one chip so that's what we
might<00:01:40.020> do<00:01:40.229> a<00:01:40.259> quote<00:01:40.590> we<00:01:40.770> say<00:01:40.950> dual<00:01:41.189> port<00:01:41.549> it's
