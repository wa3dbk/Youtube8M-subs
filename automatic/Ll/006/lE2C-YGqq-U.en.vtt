version windows 7 star is of course the
operating<00:00:48.510> system<00:00:48.809> of<00:00:48.899> choice<00:00:49.370> let's<00:00:50.370> take<00:00:50.640> a

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
operating system of choice let's take a

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.520 
operating system of choice let's take a
quick<00:00:51.030> look<00:00:51.239> around<00:00:51.390> the<00:00:51.660> system<00:00:51.930> just<00:00:52.199> gonna

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
quick look around the system just gonna

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.799 
quick look around the system just gonna
close<00:00:52.829> it<00:00:53.190> and<00:00:53.340> you<00:00:53.399> immediately<00:00:54.030> see<00:00:54.360> this

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
close it and you immediately see this

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.849 
close it and you immediately see this
kind<00:00:55.140> of<00:00:55.230> nice<00:00:55.770> pattern<00:00:56.309> on<00:00:56.789> the<00:00:57.090> lid<00:00:57.329> so<00:00:57.859> this

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
kind of nice pattern on the lid so this

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.830 
kind of nice pattern on the lid so this
is<00:00:59.010> definitely<00:00:59.340> not<00:00:59.609> going<00:01:00.120> to<00:01:00.239> be<00:01:00.420> a<00:01:00.449> finger

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
is definitely not going to be a finger

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.070 
is definitely not going to be a finger

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
magnet which I really like and let me

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.539 
magnet which I really like and let me
know<00:01:04.199> the<00:01:04.320> position<00:01:04.680> of<00:01:04.739> the<00:01:04.890> power<00:01:05.070> button<00:01:05.460> or

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
know the position of the power button or

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.609 
know the position of the power button or
this<00:01:05.850> is<00:01:06.150> kind<00:01:06.570> of<00:01:06.630> interesting<00:01:06.900> we<00:01:07.470> have<00:01:07.590> a

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
this specific version comes with a

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.200 
this specific version comes with a
3-cell<00:01:25.590> battery<00:01:25.619> of<00:01:26.189> course<00:01:26.700> there<00:01:26.970> will<00:01:27.030> also

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
3-cell battery of course there will also

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.980 
3-cell battery of course there will also
be<00:01:27.390> a<00:01:27.780> 6-cell<00:01:28.650> battery<00:01:28.799> version<00:01:29.720> what<00:01:30.720> I<00:01:30.750> also

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
be a 6-cell battery version what I also

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.950 
be a 6-cell battery version what I also
noticed<00:01:31.680> is<00:01:31.979> you<00:01:32.159> can<00:01:32.340> easily<00:01:32.850> open<00:01:33.450> the<00:01:33.750> back

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
noticed is you can easily open the back

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.030 
noticed is you can easily open the back
over<00:01:34.320> here<00:01:34.530> and<00:01:34.920> can<00:01:35.220> access<00:01:35.450> the<00:01:36.450> RAM<00:01:36.689> and<00:01:37.170> I'm

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
over here and can access the RAM and I'm

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.100 
over here and can access the RAM and I'm
not<00:01:38.280> sure<00:01:38.549> about<00:01:38.759> the<00:01:39.420> hard<00:01:39.659> disk<00:01:39.990> because

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
not sure about the hard disk because

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.980 
not sure about the hard disk because
that<00:01:40.740> might<00:01:41.100> be<00:01:41.130> down<00:01:41.670> here<00:01:41.700> somewhere

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
that might be down here somewhere

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.080 
that might be down here somewhere
maybe<00:01:43.290> even<00:01:43.710> the<00:01:43.799> Wi-Fi<00:01:44.250> card<00:01:44.610> so<00:01:44.850> that<00:01:44.880> you

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
maybe even the Wi-Fi card so that you

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.719 
maybe even the Wi-Fi card so that you
can<00:01:45.509> access<00:01:46.229> the<00:01:46.380> mini<00:01:46.560> PCI<00:01:47.009> Express<00:01:47.369> slot

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
can access the mini PCI Express slot

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.109 
can access the mini PCI Express slot
over<00:01:47.939> here<00:01:48.270> but<00:01:48.930> that's<00:01:49.470> pretty<00:01:49.710> decent<00:01:50.040> if<00:01:50.460> I

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
over here but that's pretty decent if I

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:52.910 
over here but that's pretty decent if I
compare<00:01:51.689> this<00:01:51.960> to<00:01:52.259> a<00:01:52.290> couple<00:01:52.649> of<00:01:52.710> other

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
compare this to a couple of other

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.649 
compare this to a couple of other
manufacturers<00:01:53.790> in<00:01:53.820> these<00:01:54.119> days<00:01:54.450> how

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
manufacturers in these days how

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.560 
manufacturers in these days how
complicated<00:01:55.470> they're<00:01:56.090> building<00:01:57.090> this<00:01:57.299> you

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
complicated they're building this you

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.310 
complicated they're building this you
know<00:01:57.750> that's<00:01:58.079> definitely

00:01:59.310 --> 00:01:59.320 
know that's definitely

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.700 
know that's definitely
pretty<00:01:59.470> cool<00:01:59.800> I<00:02:00.070> want<00:02:00.430> we<00:02:00.550> have<00:02:00.760> two<00:02:01.710> speakers

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:02.710 
pretty cool I want we have two speakers

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:06.330 
pretty cool I want we have two speakers
over<00:02:03.159> here<00:02:03.400> on<00:02:03.700> the<00:02:04.000> back<00:02:04.690> let's<00:02:05.530> open<00:02:05.800> it<00:02:06.159> it's

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.340 
over here on the back let's open it it's

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.580 
over here on the back let's open it it's
a<00:02:06.430> glossy<00:02:06.640> display<00:02:06.970> as<00:02:07.270> you<00:02:07.479> can<00:02:07.660> see<00:02:07.900> at<00:02:08.020> 1.3

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
it's moving a lot here but I like the

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.500 
it's moving a lot here but I like the
size<00:02:23.080> of<00:02:23.260> the<00:02:23.350> keyboard<00:02:23.890> and<00:02:24.130> the<00:02:24.970> space<00:02:25.240> in

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
between the single keys is pretty good

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:31.650 
between the single keys is pretty good
in<00:02:29.470> kind<00:02:29.740> of<00:02:29.800> integrated<00:02:30.520> trackpad<00:02:31.090> over<00:02:31.390> here

and a single mouse button kind of

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:36.090 
and a single mouse button kind of
interesting<00:02:35.230> to<00:02:35.380> see<00:02:35.620> that<00:02:35.650> there's<00:02:36.010> a

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:36.100 
interesting to see that there's a

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.729 
interesting to see that there's a
microphone<00:02:36.760> right<00:02:37.050> next<00:02:38.050> to<00:02:38.140> the<00:02:38.230> track<00:02:38.560> that

microphone right next to the track that

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:41.550 
microphone right next to the track that
that's<00:02:38.980> the<00:02:39.130> first<00:02:39.370> for<00:02:39.730> sure<00:02:39.970> it<00:02:40.930> looks

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
that's the first for sure it looks

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.490 
that's the first for sure it looks
pretty<00:02:41.950> cool<00:02:42.370> it's<00:02:42.640> very<00:02:42.940> slim<00:02:43.390> it's<00:02:44.170> very

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
pretty cool it's very slim it's very

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.920 
pretty cool it's very slim it's very
light<00:02:44.760> can't<00:02:45.760> tell<00:02:46.000> me<00:02:46.120> anything<00:02:46.390> about<00:02:46.630> the

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
light can't tell me anything about the

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.410 
light can't tell me anything about the
price<00:02:47.230> right<00:02:47.530> now<00:02:47.800> but<00:02:48.250> our<00:02:48.580> yeah<00:02:49.150> I<00:02:49.180> think

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
price right now but our yeah I think

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:52.949 
price right now but our yeah I think
it's<00:02:49.890> design<00:02:50.890> wise<00:02:51.220> pretty<00:02:52.120> decent<00:02:52.600> that<00:02:52.720> but

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:52.959 
it's design wise pretty decent that but

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:54.390 
it's design wise pretty decent that but
when<00:02:53.080> I<00:02:53.170> need<00:02:53.350> the<00:02:53.500> specs<00:02:53.769> are<00:02:53.980> pretty<00:02:54.190> good
