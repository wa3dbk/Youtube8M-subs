in at our animal we're going to brace

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:06.290 
in at our animal we're going to brace
our<00:02:03.120> arms<00:02:03.810> using<00:02:04.530> our<00:02:04.680> natural<00:02:04.950> sandbags<00:02:05.940> our

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:06.300 
our arms using our natural sandbags our

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:08.240 
our arms using our natural sandbags our
triceps<00:02:06.870> they're<00:02:07.650> going<00:02:07.770> to<00:02:07.830> go<00:02:07.980> on<00:02:08.009> the

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
triceps they're going to go on the

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.500 
triceps they're going to go on the
inside<00:02:08.879> of<00:02:09.119> the<00:02:09.239> knee<00:02:09.450> joint<00:02:09.479> on<00:02:10.140> the<00:02:10.319> inside

inside of the knee joint on the inside

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:13.729 
inside of the knee joint on the inside
now<00:02:12.510> what<00:02:12.690> you've<00:02:12.870> got<00:02:13.080> right<00:02:13.319> there<00:02:13.349> is<00:02:13.709> a

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:13.739 
now what you've got right there is a

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:16.759 
now what you've got right there is a
cross<00:02:14.129> leg<00:02:14.519> position<00:02:15.019> where<00:02:16.019> your<00:02:16.170> calves<00:02:16.500> and

00:02:16.759 --> 00:02:16.769 
cross leg position where your calves and

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:18.680 
cross leg position where your calves and
your<00:02:16.830> shins<00:02:17.250> are<00:02:17.489> against<00:02:17.879> each<00:02:18.030> other<00:02:18.269> and

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
your shins are against each other and

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.229 
your shins are against each other and
that's<00:02:18.840> actually<00:02:19.110> quite<00:02:19.530> low<00:02:19.980> so<00:02:20.910> I'm<00:02:21.090> gonna

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.239 
that's actually quite low so I'm gonna

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:23.630 
that's actually quite low so I'm gonna
have<00:02:21.510> you<00:02:21.540> cross<00:02:22.349> your<00:02:22.620> ankles<00:02:23.129> push<00:02:23.400> those

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
have you cross your ankles push those

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.399 
have you cross your ankles push those
feet<00:02:23.969> out<00:02:24.120> a<00:02:24.180> little<00:02:24.510> bit<00:02:24.749> cross<00:02:24.959> the<00:02:25.170> ankles

00:02:25.399 --> 00:02:25.409 
feet out a little bit cross the ankles

00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:26.630 
feet out a little bit cross the ankles
and<00:02:25.530> that<00:02:25.620> gives<00:02:25.829> you<00:02:25.980> a<00:02:26.010> little<00:02:26.280> bit<00:02:26.459> more

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
and that gives you a little bit more

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:27.850 
and that gives you a little bit more
height<00:02:26.939> here

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
height here

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:29.170 
height here
makes<00:02:28.100> it<00:02:28.220> a<00:02:28.280> little<00:02:28.430> easier<00:02:28.730> a<00:02:28.790> little<00:02:28.910> more

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
makes it a little easier a little more

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:34.090 
makes it a little easier a little more

great because both of those things are

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:44.560 
great because both of those things are
hard<00:02:43.070> they're<00:02:43.700> gonna<00:02:43.790> cause<00:02:44.060> a<00:02:44.090> lot<00:02:44.360> more

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:44.570

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790 
crosshairs on your aiming point that's

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:04.600 
crosshairs on your aiming point that's
on<00:03:01.910> that<00:03:02.120> animal<00:03:02.680> then<00:03:03.680> close<00:03:03.980> your<00:03:04.010> eyes<00:03:04.340> take

off up or down you can adjust by

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:17.250 
off up or down you can adjust by

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:19.160 
checking natural point of aim is

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.520 
checking natural point of aim is
actually<00:03:19.550> extremely<00:03:20.390> important<00:03:20.930> and<00:03:21.200> you're

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:21.530 
actually extremely important and you're

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:22.990 
actually extremely important and you're
probably<00:03:21.680> thinking<00:03:22.010> gosh<00:03:22.400> I<00:03:22.550> don't<00:03:22.670> have<00:03:22.820> time

to do all the deep breathing exercises

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:27.220 
to do all the deep breathing exercises
when<00:03:25.400> I'm<00:03:25.489> shooting<00:03:25.820> an<00:03:25.910> animal<00:03:26.060> but<00:03:26.900> the<00:03:27.020> nice

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:27.230 
when I'm shooting an animal but the nice

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:29.620 
when I'm shooting an animal but the nice
thing<00:03:27.260> is<00:03:27.709> the<00:03:28.190> more<00:03:28.430> you<00:03:28.640> practice<00:03:28.880> getting

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:29.630 
thing is the more you practice getting

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:31.210 
thing is the more you practice getting
your<00:03:29.840> natural<00:03:30.170> point<00:03:30.380> of<00:03:30.470> aim<00:03:30.590> and<00:03:30.770> checking

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:31.220 
your natural point of aim and checking

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:34.060 
your natural point of aim and checking
it<00:03:31.400> the<00:03:31.880> less<00:03:32.180> time<00:03:32.630> it's<00:03:32.900> going<00:03:33.049> to<00:03:33.230> take<00:03:33.500> to

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:34.070 
it the less time it's going to take to

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:36.130 
it the less time it's going to take to
get<00:03:34.250> into<00:03:34.610> that<00:03:34.730> proper<00:03:35.120> position<00:03:35.600> pretty

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:36.140 
get into that proper position pretty

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:37.750 
get into that proper position pretty
soon<00:03:36.440> you'll<00:03:36.680> find<00:03:36.890> that<00:03:37.040> when<00:03:37.280> you<00:03:37.430> go<00:03:37.610> into

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:37.760 
soon you'll find that when you go into

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.670 
soon you'll find that when you go into
your<00:03:37.970> position<00:03:38.480> you<00:03:38.840> are<00:03:39.080> in<00:03:39.110> your<00:03:39.530> natural

as<00:05:26.420> opposed<00:05:26.840> to<00:05:26.990> having<00:05:27.650> to<00:05:27.830> step<00:05:28.100> back<00:05:28.340> okay

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:28.910 
as opposed to having to step back okay

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:30.430 
as opposed to having to step back okay
you're<00:05:29.270> much<00:05:29.450> more<00:05:29.660> likely<00:05:30.050> to<00:05:30.080> lose<00:05:30.380> your

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:30.440 
you're much more likely to lose your

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:32.500 
you're much more likely to lose your
balance<00:05:30.830> if<00:05:31.490> you<00:05:31.700> throw<00:05:31.910> your<00:05:32.030> body<00:05:32.270> weight<00:05:32.480> to

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:32.510 
balance if you throw your body weight to

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:34.750 
balance if you throw your body weight to
the<00:05:32.780> rear<00:05:32.990> and<00:05:33.140> step<00:05:33.380> back<00:05:33.590> all<00:05:34.340> right<00:05:34.430> I<00:05:34.610> think

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:34.760 
the rear and step back all right I think

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:37.780 
the rear and step back all right I think
we're<00:05:35.030> ready<00:05:35.060> okay
