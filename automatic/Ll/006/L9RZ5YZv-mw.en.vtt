at<00:01:55.619> 21<00:01:56.340> conceded<00:01:56.969> so<00:01:57.479> hopefully<00:01:58.049> we<00:01:58.320> will<00:01:58.530> be

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
at 21 conceded so hopefully we will be

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.920 
at 21 conceded so hopefully we will be
able<00:01:58.680> to<00:01:59.040> win<00:01:59.430> this<00:01:59.610> episode<00:02:00.149> with<00:02:00.450> this<00:02:00.630> team

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
able to win this episode with this team

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.600 
able to win this episode with this team
it<00:02:01.290> looks<00:02:01.590> like<00:02:01.680> a<00:02:02.009> great<00:02:02.340> team<00:02:02.640> in<00:02:02.880> this

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:03.610 
it looks like a great team in this

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:06.390 
it looks like a great team in this
second<00:02:03.850> season<00:02:04.600> we<00:02:05.110> had<00:02:05.410> an<00:02:05.680> overall<00:02:06.010> growth

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:06.400 
second season we had an overall growth

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.960 
second season we had an overall growth
of<00:02:06.960> only<00:02:07.960> 15<00:02:08.950> I<00:02:09.340> don't<00:02:09.580> know<00:02:09.729> what<00:02:09.910> happened

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 
of only 15 I don't know what happened

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:12.840 
of only 15 I don't know what happened
there<00:02:10.810> was<00:02:10.990> a<00:02:11.020> big<00:02:11.320> drop<00:02:11.680> in<00:02:11.860> overall<00:02:12.250> growth

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:12.850 
there was a big drop in overall growth

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:15.720 
there was a big drop in overall growth
with<00:02:13.390> my<00:02:13.570> players<00:02:13.930> but<00:02:14.410> we<00:02:14.680> only<00:02:14.890> had<00:02:15.250> 15

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
with my players but we only had 15

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:18.060 
with my players but we only had 15
points<00:02:16.000> sadly<00:02:16.660> but<00:02:17.170> hopefully<00:02:17.740> this<00:02:17.890> will

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:18.070 
points sadly but hopefully this will

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:20.640 
points sadly but hopefully this will
change<00:02:18.370> in<00:02:18.640> the<00:02:18.670> next<00:02:18.760> season<00:02:19.210> again<00:02:20.050> and<00:02:20.320> we

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
change in the next season again and we

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.610 
change in the next season again and we
will<00:02:20.800> get<00:02:21.010> higher<00:02:21.400> but<00:02:22.150> our<00:02:22.810> team<00:02:23.170> is<00:02:23.380> really

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
will get higher but our team is really

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:26.220 
will get higher but our team is really
doing<00:02:24.070> great<00:02:24.340> our<00:02:24.730> striker<00:02:25.240> is<00:02:25.570> actually<00:02:26.080> a

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
doing great our striker is actually a

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.560 
doing great our striker is actually a
really<00:02:26.590> great<00:02:26.950> striker<00:02:27.400> he<00:02:27.700> scored<00:02:28.060> many<00:02:28.390> many

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:28.570 
really great striker he scored many many

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:31.710 
really great striker he scored many many
goals<00:02:28.990> and<00:02:29.320> in<00:02:30.070> the<00:02:30.250> championship<00:02:30.970> we<00:02:31.480> were

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
goals and in the championship we were

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:35.040 
goals and in the championship we were
the<00:02:32.170> champions<00:02:32.650> again<00:02:33.280> we<00:02:33.760> were<00:02:33.970> winning<00:02:34.840> in

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.050 
the champions again we were winning in

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:37.560 
the champions again we were winning in
the<00:02:35.080> finals<00:02:35.650> with<00:02:35.950> 32<00:02:36.580> and<00:02:36.880> you<00:02:37.240> can<00:02:37.390> see<00:02:37.540> that

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:37.570 
the finals with 32 and you can see that

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:39.480 
the finals with 32 and you can see that
we<00:02:37.840> were<00:02:37.959> in<00:02:38.110> second<00:02:38.590> place<00:02:38.800> actually<00:02:39.100> this

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:39.490 
we were in second place actually this

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:42.810 
we were in second place actually this
time<00:02:39.550> with<00:02:40.090> 53<00:02:40.780> goals<00:02:40.990> scored<00:02:41.470> and<00:02:41.820> 21

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:42.820 
time with 53 goals scored and 21

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:46.650 
time with 53 goals scored and 21
conceded<00:02:43.690> so<00:02:44.310> the<00:02:45.310> second<00:02:45.730> season<00:02:45.880> wasn't<00:02:46.360> as

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660 
conceded so the second season wasn't as

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:48.840 
conceded so the second season wasn't as
good<00:02:46.900> as<00:02:47.110> season<00:02:47.530> number<00:02:47.770> one<00:02:47.950> but<00:02:48.370> hopefully

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:48.850 
good as season number one but hopefully

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:50.250 
good as season number one but hopefully
in<00:02:49.060> the<00:02:49.090> third<00:02:49.450> season<00:02:49.660> this<00:02:50.050> would<00:02:50.230> change

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
in the third season this would change

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.550 
in the third season this would change
and<00:02:50.800> in<00:02:51.459> the<00:02:51.640> third<00:02:51.940> season<00:02:52.480> we<00:02:53.230> had<00:02:53.440> an

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
and in the third season we had an

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.000 
and in the third season we had an
overall<00:02:53.830> growth<00:02:54.220> of<00:02:54.459> 18<00:02:55.209> points<00:02:55.720> so<00:02:55.989> a<00:02:56.290> plus<00:02:56.560> 3

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 
overall growth of 18 points so a plus 3

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:00.630 
overall growth of 18 points so a plus 3
what<00:02:57.459> we<00:02:58.150> had<00:02:58.360> in<00:02:58.570> last<00:02:58.870> season<00:02:59.440> and<00:02:59.620> that<00:03:00.489> is

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.640 
what we had in last season and that is

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:03.570 
what we had in last season and that is
also<00:03:01.120> a<00:03:01.150> really<00:03:01.570> good<00:03:01.780> thing<00:03:01.810> I<00:03:02.260> think<00:03:02.770> plus<00:03:03.040> 18

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:03.580 
also a really good thing I think plus 18

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:06.540 
also a really good thing I think plus 18
is<00:03:03.820> pretty<00:03:04.810> much<00:03:04.989> okay<00:03:05.470> there<00:03:05.920> is<00:03:06.010> nothing<00:03:06.190> bad

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:06.550 
is pretty much okay there is nothing bad

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:09.479 
is pretty much okay there is nothing bad
to<00:03:06.580> say<00:03:06.790> about<00:03:07.000> this<00:03:07.390> but<00:03:08.380> if<00:03:08.560> it<00:03:08.860> would<00:03:09.310> have

00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:09.489 
to say about this but if it would have

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:11.820 
to say about this but if it would have
been<00:03:09.730> lower<00:03:10.090> we<00:03:10.690> would<00:03:10.840> have<00:03:11.049> had<00:03:11.470> some

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:11.830 
been lower we would have had some

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:14.699 
been lower we would have had some
problems<00:03:12.430> leave<00:03:13.180> at<00:03:13.360> Jack's<00:03:13.810> actually<00:03:14.470> gets
