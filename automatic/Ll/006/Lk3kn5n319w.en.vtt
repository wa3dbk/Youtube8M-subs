really basic little by body new that's
been<00:00:26.930> really<00:00:27.140> effective<00:00:27.230> for<00:00:27.739> me<00:00:28.029> it's<00:00:29.029> kind

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:29.270 
been really effective for me it's kind

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:30.970 
been really effective for me it's kind
of<00:00:29.300> more<00:00:29.450> of<00:00:29.509> a<00:00:29.630> variation<00:00:30.200> on<00:00:30.230> the<00:00:30.379> theme<00:00:30.410> than

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:30.980 
of more of a variation on the theme than

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:34.330 
of more of a variation on the theme than
it<00:00:31.099> is<00:00:31.219> you<00:00:31.669> know<00:00:31.790> a<00:00:31.820> radically<00:00:32.570> new<00:00:33.340> pattern

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:34.340 
it is you know a radically new pattern

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:36.340 
it is you know a radically new pattern
but<00:00:35.329> it's<00:00:35.450> been<00:00:35.570> really<00:00:35.690> effective<00:00:35.809> for<00:00:36.230> me

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:36.350 
but it's been really effective for me

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:38.279 
but it's been really effective for me
and<00:00:36.649> I<00:00:36.770> want<00:00:37.309> to<00:00:37.430> show<00:00:37.550> it<00:00:37.670> to<00:00:37.789> you<00:00:37.850> guys<00:00:38.000> today

capital so let's get started today for
the<00:01:10.700> thread<00:01:10.940> we're<00:01:11.060> just<00:01:11.180> going<00:01:11.299> to<00:01:11.330> use<00:01:11.570> a

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:12.200 
the thread we're just going to use a

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.390 
the thread we're just going to use a
dark<00:01:12.799> brown<00:01:13.690> uni<00:01:14.690> thread<00:01:14.960> and<00:01:15.080> a<00:01:15.260> dot<00:01:15.440> so<00:01:16.220> just

dark brown uni thread and a dot so just

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.000 
dark brown uni thread and a dot so just
start<00:01:16.520> thread<00:01:16.930> and<00:01:17.930> wrap<00:01:18.230> back<00:01:18.470> to<00:01:18.710> about<00:01:18.950> the

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:20.930 
point where the barb would be if this

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:23.950 
point where the barb would be if this
was<00:01:21.140> where<00:01:21.500> a<00:01:21.530> barbless<00:01:22.280> hook<00:01:22.840> trim<00:01:23.840> the

was where a barbless hook trim the

was where a barbless hook trim the
thread<00:01:24.170> there<00:01:24.380> and<00:01:24.730> grab<00:01:25.730> our<00:01:25.880> tailor

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840 
material for the tails on these i use

 de<00:01:30.560> Lyon<00:01:30.860> I've<00:01:31.700> experimented<00:01:32.090> with<00:01:32.360> a

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:32.420 
 de Lyon I've experimented with a

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.090 
 de Lyon I've experimented with a
lot<00:01:32.630> of<00:01:32.750> different<00:01:32.780> Taylor<00:01:33.230> materials<00:01:33.800> and<00:01:34.040> i

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 
lot of different Taylor materials and i

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.360 
lot of different Taylor materials and i
found<00:01:34.400> that<00:01:34.550> CDL<00:01:35.420> is<00:01:35.570> the<00:01:35.720> best<00:01:36.100> for<00:01:37.100> me<00:01:37.220> at

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:37.370 
found that CDL is the best for me at

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:40.690 
found that CDL is the best for me at
least<00:01:37.400> i<00:01:38.290> really<00:01:39.290> like<00:01:39.440> the<00:01:39.560> speckling<00:01:40.070> effect

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:40.700 
least i really like the speckling effect

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.870 
least i really like the speckling effect
that<00:01:40.940> this<00:01:41.290> material<00:01:42.290> gives<00:01:42.590> and<00:01:42.980> it's<00:01:43.700> really

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:43.880 
that this material gives and it's really

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:45.220 
that this material gives and it's really
durable<00:01:44.210> so<00:01:44.750> you're<00:01:44.900> not<00:01:44.960> going<00:01:45.080> to<00:01:45.170> be

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:45.230 
durable so you're not going to be

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:47.800 
durable so you're not going to be
breaking<00:01:45.590> off<00:01:45.680> as<00:01:45.830> many<00:01:45.950> tales<00:01:46.450> as<00:01:47.450> you<00:01:47.630> would

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810 
breaking off as many tales as you would

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:49.300 
breaking off as many tales as you would
if<00:01:48.050> you<00:01:48.080> were<00:01:48.230> using<00:01:48.410> something<00:01:48.740> like<00:01:48.860> wood

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:49.310 
if you were using something like wood

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:53.370 
if you were using something like wood
duck<00:01:49.780> so<00:01:50.780> tied<00:01:50.990> in<00:01:51.140> about<00:01:51.470> one<00:01:52.370> shank<00:01:52.760> length

duck so tied in about one shank length
in<00:01:54.380> a<00:01:54.470> pretty<00:01:54.680> much<00:01:54.860> standard<00:01:57.160> length<00:01:58.160> for

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:58.610 
in a pretty much standard length for

00:01:58.610 --> 00:01:59.890 
in a pretty much standard length for
just<00:01:58.880> about<00:01:58.970> anything<00:01:59.210> if<00:01:59.360> pattern<00:01:59.690> at<00:01:59.780> your

00:01:59.890 --> 00:01:59.900 
just about anything if pattern at your

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:03.610 
just about anything if pattern at your
time<00:02:00.520> so<00:02:01.520> tie<00:02:02.210> that<00:02:02.390> in<00:02:02.570> and<00:02:02.840> wrap<00:02:03.290> it<00:02:03.440> all<00:02:03.590> the

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:03.620 
time so tie that in and wrap it all the

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:05.140 
time so tie that in and wrap it all the
way<00:02:03.770> forward<00:02:04.040> to<00:02:04.190> the<00:02:04.280> bead<00:02:04.460> and<00:02:04.670> cut<00:02:04.850> it<00:02:04.970> there

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:05.150 
way forward to the bead and cut it there

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:11.460 
way forward to the bead and cut it there
that's<00:02:06.140> going<00:02:06.440> to<00:02:06.530> help<00:02:06.650> keep<00:02:06.950> a<00:02:07.390> uniform<00:02:10.450> body

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
that's going to help keep a uniform body

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.850 
that's going to help keep a uniform body
which<00:02:12.470> is<00:02:12.500> really<00:02:12.920> important<00:02:13.900> with<00:02:14.900> buy<00:02:15.800> it

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
which is really important with buy it

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.630 
which is really important with buy it
bodies<00:02:16.659> because<00:02:17.659> any<00:02:17.900> little<00:02:18.640> discrepancies

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
bodies because any little discrepancies

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:01.330 
segmented look so I'll just tie that in

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:07.240 
segmented look so I'll just tie that in
right<00:03:02.330> here<00:03:02.750> and<00:03:05.200> wrap<00:03:06.200> all<00:03:06.440> the<00:03:06.620> way<00:03:06.650> back<00:03:06.890> to

with<00:03:10.970> a<00:03:11.030> bio<00:03:11.270> body<00:03:11.600> because<00:03:12.050> you're<00:03:12.320> not<00:03:12.470> going

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.650 
with a bio body because you're not going

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:14.140 
with a bio body because you're not going
to<00:03:12.710> be<00:03:12.800> able<00:03:12.830> to<00:03:13.040> cover<00:03:13.280> up<00:03:13.490> any<00:03:13.640> gaps<00:03:13.940> or

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:16.190 
anything like that so now we're just

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:19.840 
anything like that so now we're just
going<00:03:16.340> to<00:03:16.670> wrap<00:03:17.090> the<00:03:17.450> buy<00:03:17.630> it<00:03:17.690> body<00:03:17.960> forward<00:03:18.850> as

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:19.850 
going to wrap the buy it body forward as

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:21.220 
going to wrap the buy it body forward as
you're<00:03:20.120> wrapping<00:03:20.510> you'll<00:03:20.660> immediately<00:03:20.900> see

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:21.230 
you're wrapping you'll immediately see

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:25.540 
you're wrapping you'll immediately see
that<00:03:21.530> there's<00:03:22.010> a<00:03:22.540> lot<00:03:23.540> of<00:03:23.570> segmentation<00:03:24.550> that

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:25.550 
that there's a lot of segmentation that

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:29.410 
that there's a lot of segmentation that
occurs<00:03:25.880> from<00:03:26.570> the<00:03:27.400> raised<00:03:28.400> portion<00:03:28.790> of<00:03:29.240> the

occurs from the raised portion of the

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:31.270 
occurs from the raised portion of the
buy<00:03:29.570> it<00:03:29.630> there<00:03:29.900> just<00:03:30.560> wrap<00:03:30.770> up<00:03:30.800> to<00:03:31.040> the<00:03:31.130> bead

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:31.280 
buy it there just wrap up to the bead

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:37.990 
buy it there just wrap up to the bead
and<00:03:31.430> tie<00:03:31.640> off<00:03:32.170> right<00:03:33.170> there<00:03:34.450> cut<00:03:35.450> that<00:03:36.940> give<00:03:37.940> it

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.000 
and tie off right there cut that give it

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.400 
and tie off right there cut that give it
a<00:03:38.030> couple<00:03:38.209> more<00:03:38.360> thread<00:03:38.600> reps<00:03:38.810> move<00:03:39.140> that<00:03:39.290> up

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:39.410 
a couple more thread reps move that up

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:40.750 
a couple more thread reps move that up
now<00:03:39.590> we're<00:03:39.709> going<00:03:39.800> to<00:03:39.860> counter<00:03:40.340> rib<00:03:40.550> our

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760 
now we're going to counter rib our

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:44.110 
now we're going to counter rib our
copper<00:03:41.180> wire<00:03:41.390> through<00:03:41.990> the<00:03:42.020> fly<00:03:42.410> I<00:03:43.280> like<00:03:43.910> to

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:44.120 
copper wire through the fly I like to

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.840 
copper wire through the fly I like to
wrap<00:03:44.480> right<00:03:44.900> in<00:03:45.140> between<00:03:45.290> the<00:03:46.190> raised

wrap right in between the raised
portions<00:03:47.480> of<00:03:47.720> the<00:03:48.140> buy<00:03:48.320> it<00:03:48.380> it's<00:03:49.340> just<00:03:49.520> going

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:49.700 
portions of the buy it it's just going

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:50.980 
portions of the buy it it's just going
to<00:03:49.730> add<00:03:49.850> a<00:03:49.880> little<00:03:50.030> bit<00:03:50.150> of<00:03:50.209> flash<00:03:50.480> to<00:03:50.720> the<00:03:50.810> fly

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:50.990 
to add a little bit of flash to the fly

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:52.990 
to add a little bit of flash to the fly
and<00:03:51.230> a<00:03:51.410> whole<00:03:51.709> lot<00:03:51.890> of<00:03:51.920> durability<00:03:52.160> to<00:03:52.670> bet<00:03:52.790> by

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:53.000 
and a whole lot of durability to bet by

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.720 
and a whole lot of durability to bet by
it<00:03:53.410> so<00:03:54.410> now<00:03:54.530> we're<00:03:54.650> going<00:03:54.739> to<00:03:54.800> twist<00:03:55.100> this<00:03:55.370> and

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:55.730 
it so now we're going to twist this and

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:57.400 
it so now we're going to twist this and
pull<00:03:56.390> at<00:03:56.540> the<00:03:56.570> same<00:03:56.780> time<00:03:56.959> it's<00:03:57.200> going<00:03:57.320> to

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:57.410 
pull at the same time it's going to

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:59.290 
pull at the same time it's going to
break<00:03:57.590> the<00:03:57.770> wire<00:03:57.950> off<00:03:58.220> it's<00:03:58.940> a<00:03:59.000> little<00:03:59.209> bit

00:03:59.290 --> 00:03:59.300 
break the wire off it's a little bit

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:01.270 
break the wire off it's a little bit
smoother<00:03:59.690> and<00:03:59.810> cleaner<00:04:00.080> doing<00:04:00.980> it<00:04:01.100> that<00:04:01.250> way

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:01.280 
smoother and cleaner doing it that way

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:04.600 
smoother and cleaner doing it that way
than<00:04:02.209> it<00:04:02.330> would<00:04:02.450> be<00:04:02.480> if<00:04:02.840> you<00:04:02.870> were<00:04:03.220> to<00:04:04.220> cut<00:04:04.459> the

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:04.610 
than it would be if you were to cut the

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:08.170 
than it would be if you were to cut the
wire<00:04:05.080> next<00:04:06.080> for<00:04:06.290> the<00:04:06.320> the<00:04:06.890> collar<00:04:07.190> we're<00:04:08.060> just

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:09.370 
wire next for the the collar we're just
going<00:04:08.300> to<00:04:08.330> use<00:04:08.450> a<00:04:08.480> little<00:04:08.690> bit<00:04:08.780> of<00:04:08.840> blended

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:09.380

going to go into spin our bobbin

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:00.189 
going to go into spin our bobbin
clockwise<00:04:58.580> well<00:04:59.449> that's<00:04:59.599> going<00:04:59.720> to<00:04:59.810> do<00:04:59.960> is

00:05:00.189 --> 00:05:00.199 
clockwise well that's going to do is

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:02.740 
clockwise well that's going to do is
it's<00:05:00.530> going<00:05:00.919> to<00:05:00.979> trap<00:05:01.729> the<00:05:01.909> materials<00:05:02.389> in<00:05:02.569> the

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:02.750 
it's going to trap the materials in the

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:04.899 
it's going to trap the materials in the
thread<00:05:03.020> itself<00:05:03.409> for<00:05:04.159> the<00:05:04.190> dubbing<00:05:04.550> and<00:05:04.759> it's

00:05:04.899 --> 00:05:04.909 
thread itself for the dubbing and it's

00:05:04.909 --> 00:05:07.210 
thread itself for the dubbing and it's
going<00:05:05.060> to<00:05:05.120> create<00:05:05.690> a<00:05:05.810> really<00:05:06.080> loose<00:05:06.349> and<00:05:06.650> spiky

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:07.220 
going to create a really loose and spiky

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:10.719 
going to create a really loose and spiky
w<00:05:07.580> brush<00:05:07.789> which<00:05:08.060> is<00:05:08.830> in<00:05:09.830> my<00:05:10.159> opinion<00:05:10.190> one<00:05:10.699> of

00:05:10.719 --> 00:05:10.729 
w brush which is in my opinion one of

00:05:10.729 --> 00:05:13.540 
w brush which is in my opinion one of
the<00:05:10.930> most<00:05:11.930> important<00:05:12.409> parts<00:05:12.740> of<00:05:12.949> this<00:05:13.099> fly<00:05:13.340> and

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:13.550 
the most important parts of this fly and

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:17.170 
the most important parts of this fly and
you<00:05:13.639> can<00:05:13.759> kind<00:05:13.909> of<00:05:14.000> see<00:05:14.210> here<00:05:14.630> how<00:05:16.060> spiky<00:05:17.060> that

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:17.180 
you can kind of see here how spiky that

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:20.710 
you can kind of see here how spiky that
is<00:05:18.039> so<00:05:19.039> now<00:05:19.190> all<00:05:19.220> we're<00:05:19.490> going<00:05:19.610> to<00:05:19.669> do<00:05:19.819> is<00:05:20.060> wrap

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:20.720 
is so now all we're going to do is wrap

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:22.570 
is so now all we're going to do is wrap
this<00:05:21.080> dubbing<00:05:21.560> collar<00:05:21.770> right<00:05:22.009> behind<00:05:22.250> the<00:05:22.400> be

fly and another really important part in

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:53.219 
fly and another really important part in
my<00:05:50.509> opinion<00:05:50.810> is<00:05:51.169> going<00:05:51.469> to<00:05:51.620> be<00:05:51.800> the<00:05:52.099> hot<00:05:52.340> spot

00:05:53.219 --> 00:05:53.229 
my opinion is going to be the hot spot

00:05:53.229 --> 00:05:55.779 
my opinion is going to be the hot spot
for<00:05:54.229> the<00:05:54.319> hot<00:05:54.469> spot<00:05:54.800> I'm<00:05:55.009> just<00:05:55.279> going<00:05:55.520> to<00:05:55.580> use

for the hot spot I'm just going to use

00:05:55.789 --> 00:05:59.409 
for the hot spot I'm just going to use
chartreuse<00:05:56.389> uni<00:05:56.870> thread<00:05:57.819> usually<00:05:58.819> use<00:05:58.969> an<00:05:59.180> a

00:05:59.409 --> 00:05:59.419 
chartreuse uni thread usually use an a

00:05:59.419 --> 00:06:01.360 
chartreuse uni thread usually use an a
dot<00:05:59.599> I<00:05:59.750> just<00:05:59.960> happen<00:06:00.259> to<00:06:00.289> have<00:06:00.380> the<00:06:00.770> six<00:06:01.190> saw<00:06:01.310> it

dot I just happen to have the six saw it

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:03.189 
dot I just happen to have the six saw it
sitting<00:06:01.580> out<00:06:01.819> right<00:06:02.029> here<00:06:02.240> so<00:06:02.479> this<00:06:02.870> is<00:06:03.050> what

00:06:03.189 --> 00:06:03.199 
sitting out right here so this is what

00:06:03.199 --> 00:06:06.430 
sitting out right here so this is what
we're<00:06:03.289> going<00:06:03.380> to<00:06:03.469> use<00:06:04.210> just<00:06:05.210> make<00:06:05.330> a<00:06:05.360> few<00:06:05.690> small

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:06.440 
we're going to use just make a few small

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:11.140 
we're going to use just make a few small
wraps<00:06:06.860> right<00:06:07.310> behind<00:06:07.639> the<00:06:07.849> bead<00:06:08.060> and<00:06:10.029> you<00:06:11.029> know

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:11.150 
wraps right behind the bead and you know

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:13.689 
wraps right behind the bead and you know
you<00:06:11.210> really<00:06:11.740> it's<00:06:12.740> it's<00:06:12.919> really<00:06:13.130> it's<00:06:13.490> similar

00:06:13.689 --> 00:06:13.699 
you really it's it's really it's similar

00:06:13.699 --> 00:06:15.040 
you really it's it's really it's similar
to<00:06:13.819> dubbing<00:06:14.210> you<00:06:14.270> know<00:06:14.360> less<00:06:14.569> is<00:06:14.599> more<00:06:14.960> you

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:15.050 
to dubbing you know less is more you
