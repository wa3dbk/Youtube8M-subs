00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
five sprays and when you consider the

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.310 
five sprays and when you consider the
fact<00:01:14.549> that<00:01:14.729> its<00:01:14.939> main<00:01:15.180> ingredient<00:01:15.780> soybean

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
fact that its main ingredient soybean

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.990 
fact that its main ingredient soybean
oil<00:01:16.590> contains<00:01:17.100> about<00:01:17.310> a<00:01:17.369> hundred<00:01:17.820> twenty

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
calories per tablespoon and that means

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.370 
calories per tablespoon and that means
the<00:01:20.100> entire<00:01:20.250> bottle<00:01:20.909> has<00:01:21.150> almost<00:01:21.540> 900

the entire bottle has almost 900
calories<00:01:22.619> even<00:01:23.400> though<00:01:23.490> its<00:01:23.640> advertising

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
calories even though its advertising

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.960 
calories even though its advertising
suggests<00:01:24.689> that<00:01:25.229> it<00:01:25.350> is<00:01:25.380> a<00:01:25.680> zero<00:01:26.009> calorie<00:01:26.549> food

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
suggests that it is a zero calorie food

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.910 
suggests that it is a zero calorie food

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
you'd be burning about 64 calories a day

you'd be burning about 64 calories a day
for<00:02:37.790> a<00:02:37.880> year<00:02:38.180> that<00:02:38.210> equates<00:02:38.690> to<00:02:38.780> about<00:02:38.930> six<00:02:39.290> and

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:39.350 
for a year that equates to about six and

a half pounds as far as weight loss is

definitely<00:02:46.040> aren't<00:02:46.310> now<00:02:46.730> what<00:02:46.910> about<00:02:47.000> foods

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 
definitely aren't now what about foods

that are heavy and mass but claim to

have zero or very low calories how do
those<00:02:51.590> work<00:02:51.650> well<00:02:52.070> the<00:02:52.280> idea<00:02:52.550> is<00:02:52.730> that<00:02:52.760> those

those work well the idea is that those

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:54.760 
those work well the idea is that those
foods<00:02:53.420> are<00:02:53.600> made<00:02:53.780> up<00:02:53.900> of<00:02:53.990> ingredients<00:02:54.620> your

body simply can't break down if you were

00:02:58.810 --> 00:02:58.820 
to think about it in very abstract terms

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:00.700 
to think about it in very abstract terms
you<00:02:59.090> could<00:02:59.210> almost<00:02:59.390> liken<00:02:59.780> it<00:02:59.960> to<00:03:00.020> eating<00:03:00.650> a

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:00.710 
you could almost liken it to eating a

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:02.680 
you could almost liken it to eating a
piece<00:03:00.920> of<00:03:01.070> plastic<00:03:01.580> your<00:03:02.030> body<00:03:02.240> can't<00:03:02.540> digest

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:04.630 
piece of plastic your body can't digest
it<00:03:03.170> so<00:03:03.320> it<00:03:03.410> simply<00:03:03.800> passes<00:03:04.340> through<00:03:04.520> your

it so it simply passes through your

it so it simply passes through your
