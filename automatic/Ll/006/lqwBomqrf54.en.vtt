00:00:06.399 --> 00:00:13.399
 Book of Habacuc Chapter 1 

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:22.769
 Hab 1: 1 The prophecy that the prophet Habakkuk saw. Hab 1: 2 How long, O Lord, will I cry, 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:27.000
 and you will not hear; and I will cry out to you because of the violence, and you will not save? 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.269
 Hab 1: 3 Why do you make me see iniquity, and cause you to see discomfort? Destruction and violence 

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:35.510
 they stand before me, and strife and contention arise. 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:40.850
 Hab 1: 4 Wherefore the law is weakened, and the judgment is not according to the truth; by 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:44.799
 as the ungodly besieges the righteous, that is why justice is twisted. 

00:00:44.799 --> 00:00:50.049
 Hab 1: 5 Look among the nations, and see, and be amazed; because I will do a work in your 

00:00:50.049 --> 00:00:53.650
 days, that even when I tell you, you will not believe it. 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:58.930
 Hab 1: 6 For, behold, I lift up the Chaldeans, a cruel and hasty nation, who walks 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:01.839
 by the width of the earth to possess the dwellings of others. 

00:01:01.839 --> 00:01:07.140
 Hab 1: 7 Formidable is and terrible; from it comes his justice and dignity. 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.330
 Hab 1: 8 Your horses will be lighter than leopards, and more ferocious than night wolves, 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.850
 and his riders will multiply; Their riders will come from afar, and they will fly like eagles 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:21.820
 who rush to devour. Hab 1: 9 All of it will come to the prey; the horror 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:25.240
 go ahead of her, and pick up captives like sand. 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:30.740
 Hab 1:10 He will scorn kings, and princes he will mock; will laugh at all 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:36.250
 fortress, and will raise embankment and take it. Hab 1:11 Then it will pass like the hurricane, and 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:41.030
 he will offend attributing his strength to his god. Hab 1:12 Are you not from the beginning, 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:48.030
 O LORD, my God, my Holy One? We will not die. You have put it for judgment, O Jehovah; and you, 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:53.780
 Oh Rock, you founded it to punish. Hab 1:13 Very clean you are eyes to see 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:58.630
 evil, nor can you see the wrong; Why do you see the despisers, and shut up when 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:02.960
 the wicked destroys the righteous more than he, Hab 1:14 and you make men like 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.860
 the fish of the sea, like reptiles that have no one to govern them? 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:11.370
 Hab 1:15 He will take them all out with a hook, he will pick them up with his net, and he will gather them in his 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:17.749
 tights; therefore he will rejoice and rejoice. Hab 1:16 For this he will make sacrifices to his net, 

00:02:17.749 --> 00:02:22.900
 and he will offer incense to his tights; because with them he fattened his portion, and greased 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.950
 their food. Hab 1:17 Will you empty your network for that, and you will not have 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:31.620
 pity to annihilate nations continuously? Episode 2 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:37.749
 Hab 2: 1 I will be over my guard, and over the fortress I will establish my foot, and will watch over 

00:02:37.749 --> 00:02:41.989
 see what I will be told, and what I have to answer regarding my complaint. 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:46.969
 Hab 2: 2 And the LORD answered me, and said, Write the vision, and declare it in tables, that 

00:02:46.969 --> 00:02:50.739
 run the one that I read in it. Hab 2: 3 Although the vision will still take 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:56.609
 a time, but hasten to the end, and will not lie; although I will delay, wait for it, because 

00:02:56.609 --> 00:03:02.139
 It will certainly come, it will not be long. Hab 2: 4 Behold, he whose soul is not 

00:03:02.139 --> 00:03:04.980
 straight, he is proud; but the just shall live by his faith. 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:10.939
 Hab 2: 5 And also, that which is given to wine is treacherous, a proud man, that shall not stand; 

00:03:10.939 --> 00:03:15.840
 He enlarges his soul like Sheol, and he is like death, which will not be satisfied; before he met 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.840
 for all the nations, and gathered together all the peoples. 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:24.799
 Hab 2: 6 Are they not to raise all these sayings about him, and sarcasm against him? 

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:30.249
 They will say: Woe to him who multiplied what was not his! How long was it to accumulate 

00:03:30.249 --> 00:03:34.269
 about it, piece after piece? Hab 2: 7 Will not your feet suddenly rise up? 

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:39.959
 debtors, and those who will make you tremble will awaken, and you will be spoil to them? 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:44.699
 Hab 2: 8 Because you have spoiled many nations, all the other nations will plunder you, 

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:49.109
 because of the blood of men, and of the thefts of the earth, of the cities and 

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:53.709
 of all those who live in them. Hab 2: 9 Woe to him who covets unjust gain 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:58.449
 for his house, to raise his nest, to escape from the power of evil! 

00:03:58.449 --> 00:04:03.659
 Hab 2:10 You took shameful counsel for your house, you laid many peoples desolate, and you have sinned 

00:04:03.659 --> 00:04:06.799
 against your life Hab 2:11 For the stone will cry out from 

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:11.699
 wall, and the timbered table will respond. Hab 2:12 Woe to him who builds the city with 

00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:17.949
 blood, and from the one who founded a city with iniquity! Hab 2:13 Is not this the LORD of hosts? 

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:21.970
 The people, then, will work for the fire, and the nations will tire themselves in vain. 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:27.000
 Hab 2:14 For the earth will be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the Lord, as 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:33.240
 the waters cover the sea. Hab 2:15 Woe to him who gives drink to his neighbor! 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:37.680
 Woe to you, that you bring him your gall, and make him drunk to look at his nakedness! 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:40.740
 Hab 2:16 You have filled yourself with disgrace rather than honor; drink you too, and you will be discovered; 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:46.470
 the chalice of the right hand of Jehovah will come to you, and vomit of insult upon your glory. 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:51.050
 Hab 2:17 For the plunder of Lebanon will fall on you, and the destruction of wild beasts 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:56.259
 it will break you, because of the blood of men, and of the theft of the earth, of the cities 

00:04:56.259 --> 00:04:59.440
 and of all those who lived in them. Hab 2:18 What good is the sculpture that 

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:04.960
 He carved the one who made it? The casting statue that teaches lies, so that doing 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:10.840
 mute images, trust the maker in his work? Hab 2:19 Woe to him who says to the stick, Awake; 

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:17.430
 and the silent stone: Get up! Can he teach? Behold, it is covered with gold and 

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:22.169
 silver, and there is no spirit within him. Hab 2:20 But the Lord is in his holy temple; 

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:26.460
 street before him the whole earth. Chapter 3 

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:31.960
 Hab 3: 1 Prayer of the prophet Habakkuk, on Sigionot. 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:36.000
 Hab 3: 2 O LORD, I have heard your word, and I feared. 

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.370
 O Jehovah, revive your work in the midst of the times, 

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:44.069
 In the middle of the time make it known; In anger, remember mercy. 

00:05:44.069 --> 00:05:48.439
 Hab 3: 3 God will come from Teman, and the Holy One from Mount Paran. Selah 

00:05:48.439 --> 00:05:51.659
 His glory covered the heavens, And the earth was filled with his praise. 

00:05:51.659 --> 00:05:57.610
 Hab 3: 4 And the brightness was as the light; Bright rays came out of his hand, 

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:02.060
 And there was his power hidden. Hab 3: 5 In front of his face was death, 

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:07.080
 And burning coals came out at his feet. Hab 3: 6 He arose, and measured the earth; 

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:12.080
 He looked, and made the people tremble; The ancient mountains were shredded, 

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:16.060
 The old hills humbled themselves. His ways are eternal. 

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:19.360
 Hab 3: 7 I have seen the tents of Cushan in affliction; 

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:24.289
 The tents of the land of Midian trembled. Hab 3: 8 Have you been angry, O LORD, against the 

00:06:24.289 --> 00:06:26.599
 rivers? Against the rivers did you get angry? 

00:06:26.599 --> 00:06:29.879
 Was your anger against the sea When you rode on your horses, 

00:06:29.879 --> 00:06:34.379
 And in your victory cars? Hab 3: 9 Your bow was discovered entirely; 

00:06:34.379 --> 00:06:37.990
 The oaths to the tribes were sure word. Selah 

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:42.580
 You split the earth with rivers. Hab 3:10 The mountains saw you and were afraid; 

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:45.909
 The flood of waters passed; The abyss gave his voice, 

00:06:45.909 --> 00:06:50.819
 Overhead he raised his hands. Hab 3:11 The sun and the moon stood on their 

00:06:50.819 --> 00:06:52.789
 place; In the light of your arrows they went, 

00:06:52.789 --> 00:06:57.060
 And the glow of your bright spear. Hab 3:12 You trampled the land in anger, 

00:06:57.060 --> 00:07:01.879
 With rage you tricked the nations. Hab 3:13 You came out to help your people, 

00:07:01.879 --> 00:07:06.879
 To help your anointed. You have pierced the head of the house of the wicked, 

00:07:06.879 --> 00:07:11.289
 Discovering the foundation to the rock. Selah Hab 3:14 Horadaste with your own darts 

00:07:11.289 --> 00:07:15.449
 the heads of his warriors, who as a storm rushed to disperse me, 

00:07:15.449 --> 00:07:18.949
 Whose rejoicing was like to devour the poor covertly. 

00:07:18.949 --> 00:07:23.530
 Hab 3:15 You walked on the sea with your horses, On the mass of the great waters. 

00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:28.430
 Hab 3:16 I heard, and my bowels were moved; At the voice my lips trembled; 

00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:33.020
 Rottenness entered my bones, and within me I shuddered; 

00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:37.639
 While I will be still in the day of anguish, When I go up to the people who will invade 

00:07:37.639 --> 00:07:40.069
 with your troops. Hab 3:17 Even if the fig tree does not flower, 

00:07:40.069 --> 00:07:44.009
 There is no fruit in the vines, Even if the olive product is missing, 

00:07:44.009 --> 00:07:49.219
 And the tilled ones do not maintain, And the sheep are removed from the fold, 

00:07:49.219 --> 00:07:54.680
 And there are no cows in the corrals; Hab 3:18 Nevertheless, I will rejoice in the Lord, 

00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:58.180
 And I will rejoice in the God of my salvation. Hab 3:19 The Lord GOD is my strength, 

00:07:58.180 --> 00:08:02.680
 Which makes my feet like hinds, And in my heights makes me walk. 

00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:02.930
 To the leader of the singers, on my string instruments.
