what<00:01:07.170> kind<00:01:07.409> of<00:01:07.470> material<00:01:07.950> this<00:01:08.100> is<00:01:08.159> it<00:01:08.549> looks

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
what kind of material this is it looks

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.350 
what kind of material this is it looks
like<00:01:09.060> it<00:01:10.020> doesn't<00:01:10.380> look<00:01:10.530> like<00:01:10.920> much<00:01:11.280> but<00:01:11.360> the

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
like it doesn't look like much but the

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.929 
like it doesn't look like much but the
grip<00:01:12.630> on<00:01:12.780> it<00:01:12.930> it's<00:01:13.380> crazy<00:01:13.710> because<00:01:14.640> I<00:01:14.880> think

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
grip on it it's crazy because I think

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.830 
grip on it it's crazy because I think
this<00:01:15.420> is<00:01:15.600> a<00:01:15.960> cheese<00:01:16.259> all<00:01:16.619> right<00:01:17.360> it's<00:01:18.360> meant<00:01:18.750> to

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
this is a cheese all right it's meant to

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.140 
this is a cheese all right it's meant to
be<00:01:18.960> used<00:01:19.439> on<00:01:19.680> the<00:01:19.799> boat<00:01:20.009> so<00:01:20.369> sailors<00:01:20.909> don't

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
be used on the boat so sailors don't

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.490 
be used on the boat so sailors don't
slip<00:01:21.540> and<00:01:21.780> fall<00:01:22.259> so<00:01:22.890> I<00:01:23.159> guess<00:01:23.930> this<00:01:24.930> shoes<00:01:25.259> will

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
slip and fall so I guess this shoes will

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:32.330 
slip and fall so I guess this shoes will
be<00:01:25.650> pretty<00:01:25.950> like<00:01:26.340> well<00:01:28.070> well<00:01:29.070> I<00:01:30.860> think<00:01:31.860> it's<00:01:32.189> a

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
be pretty like well well I think it's a

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.560 
be pretty like well well I think it's a
very<00:01:32.689> sturdy<00:01:33.689> shoe<00:01:34.140> because<00:01:35.210> the<00:01:36.210> leather<00:01:36.420> is

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
very sturdy shoe because the leather is

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.319 
very sturdy shoe because the leather is
not<00:01:37.470> very<00:01:37.890> soft<00:01:38.130> as<00:01:38.369> two<00:01:38.729> kinds<00:01:39.030> of<00:01:39.090> brands

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
not very soft as two kinds of brands

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:42.200 
not very soft as two kinds of brands
that's<00:01:39.600> Doc's<00:01:39.960> itís<00:01:40.470> the<00:01:41.220> Sebago<00:01:41.700> dockside

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
that's Doc's itís the Sebago dockside

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:47.030 
that's Doc's itís the Sebago dockside
and<00:01:42.950> the<00:01:43.950> Sperry<00:01:44.570> topsides<00:01:45.570> so<00:01:46.079> two<00:01:46.799> different

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
and the Sperry topsides so two different

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.300 
and the Sperry topsides so two different
brands<00:01:47.780> the<00:01:48.780> top<00:01:49.020> sites<00:01:49.290> are<00:01:49.560> basically<00:01:49.710> more

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
brands the top sites are basically more

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.539 
brands the top sites are basically more
softer<00:01:50.939> material<00:01:51.570> this<00:01:52.140> is<00:01:52.380> harder<00:01:52.860> so<00:01:53.130> this

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
softer material this is harder so this

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.670 
softer material this is harder so this
will<00:01:53.880> require<00:01:54.210> a<00:01:54.329> big<00:01:54.689> break<00:01:54.960> in<00:01:54.990> period

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
will require a big break in period

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.010 
will require a big break in period
okay<00:01:55.950> these<00:01:56.369> require<00:01:56.790> a<00:01:56.820> big<00:01:57.090> breaking<00:01:57.509> period

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
okay these require a big breaking period

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:06.520 
okay these require a big breaking period
so<00:01:58.320> I<00:01:59.960> don't<00:02:00.960> know<00:02:01.049> and<00:02:01.259> what<00:02:02.040> else<00:02:02.340> um<00:02:03.680> it's

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530 
so I don't know and what else um it's

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.100 
so I don't know and what else um it's
it's<00:02:07.530> it<00:02:08.520> runs<00:02:08.789> kind<00:02:09.300> of<00:02:09.390> small<00:02:09.629> okay<00:02:09.899> I

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
it's it runs kind of small okay I

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.910
