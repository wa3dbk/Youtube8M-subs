powder I mean I do like this foundation
I<00:03:50.640> still<00:03:50.940> used<00:03:51.240> about<00:03:51.510> five<00:03:51.750> pumps<00:03:52.290> you<00:03:52.740> know

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:52.830 
I still used about five pumps you know

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:54.800 
I still used about five pumps you know
to<00:03:52.890> put<00:03:53.190> it<00:03:53.310> all<00:03:53.400> over<00:03:53.430> my<00:03:53.820> face<00:03:53.850> because

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810 
to put it all over my face because

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:56.630

that's<00:03:55.140> the<00:03:55.470> kind<00:03:55.650> of<00:03:55.710> coverage<00:03:56.010> I<00:03:56.130> want<00:03:56.160> it<00:03:56.550> I

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:56.640 
that's the kind of coverage I want it I

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.490 
that's the kind of coverage I want it I
imagine<00:03:57.210> you<00:03:57.390> can<00:03:57.570> use<00:03:57.690> two<00:03:57.930> or<00:03:57.960> three<00:03:58.080> if<00:03:58.350> you

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
imagine you can use two or three if you

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.350 
imagine you can use two or three if you
want<00:03:58.800> but<00:03:59.340> you<00:03:59.460> get<00:03:59.580> the<00:03:59.670> coverage<00:04:00.030> that<00:04:00.060> I

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:00.360 
want but you get the coverage that I

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:03.830 
want but you get the coverage that I
have<00:04:00.750> now<00:04:01.020> which<00:04:01.440> is<00:04:01.590> what<00:04:01.950> I<00:04:02.100> like<00:04:02.570> I'll<00:04:03.570> use

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 
have now which is what I like I'll use

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:06.350 
have now which is what I like I'll use
five<00:04:04.110> you<00:04:04.530> can<00:04:04.740> build<00:04:04.980> it<00:04:05.130> up<00:04:05.250> I<00:04:05.550> don't<00:04:05.670> know<00:04:06.150> if

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:06.360 
five you can build it up I don't know if

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:07.790 
five you can build it up I don't know if
I<00:04:06.510> will<00:04:06.660> call<00:04:06.930> this<00:04:07.110> a<00:04:07.260> full<00:04:07.530> coverage

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:07.800 
I will call this a full coverage

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:10.370 
I will call this a full coverage
foundation<00:04:08.120> but<00:04:09.120> I<00:04:09.150> definitely<00:04:09.900> consider<00:04:10.140> it

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:10.380 
foundation but I definitely consider it

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:11.780 
foundation but I definitely consider it
like<00:04:10.470> kind<00:04:10.920> of<00:04:10.980> medium<00:04:11.280> coverage<00:04:11.550> because<00:04:11.730> I

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790 
like kind of medium coverage because I

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:13.040 
like kind of medium coverage because I
don't<00:04:11.940> really<00:04:12.090> have<00:04:12.330> a<00:04:12.360> lot<00:04:12.540> of<00:04:12.570> dark<00:04:12.780> spots

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:13.050 
don't really have a lot of dark spots

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:15.980 
don't really have a lot of dark spots
right<00:04:13.500> now<00:04:13.680> so<00:04:14.430> it<00:04:14.550> wasn't<00:04:14.880> a<00:04:14.910> lot<00:04:15.150> to<00:04:15.180> really

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:15.990 
right now so it wasn't a lot to really

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:19.820 
right now so it wasn't a lot to really
conceal<00:04:16.530> or<00:04:16.739> anything<00:04:16.950> so<00:04:17.700> I<00:04:17.940> to<00:04:18.750> mean<00:04:19.020> this<00:04:19.620> is

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:19.830 
conceal or anything so I to mean this is

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:21.890 
conceal or anything so I to mean this is
like<00:04:19.980> medium<00:04:20.430> coverage<00:04:20.820> I<00:04:21.030> guess<00:04:21.570> you<00:04:21.720> can

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:21.900 
like medium coverage I guess you can

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:23.680 
like medium coverage I guess you can
build<00:04:22.080> it<00:04:22.200> up<00:04:22.260> to<00:04:22.410> full<00:04:22.620> but<00:04:22.860> I<00:04:23.040> don't<00:04:23.280> know<00:04:23.370> who

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:23.690 
build it up to full but I don't know who

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:27.820 
build it up to full but I don't know who
