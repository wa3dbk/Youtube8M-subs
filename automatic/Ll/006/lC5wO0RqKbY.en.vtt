00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
then there are some touch sensitive keys

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.580 
then there are some touch sensitive keys
here<00:02:33.920> the<00:02:34.099> the<00:02:34.370> back<00:02:34.640> and<00:02:35.330> menu<00:02:35.540> and<00:02:35.989> home

buttons and the microphone there so I

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:40.330 
buttons and the microphone there so I
think<00:02:39.140> you've<00:02:39.410> got<00:02:39.590> the<00:02:39.650> streak<00:02:39.860> powered<00:02:40.220> on

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
think you've got the streak powered on

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:44.130

00:02:58.119 --> 00:02:58.129 
see these many bars on the top the main

00:02:58.129 --> 00:02:59.500 
see these many bars on the top the main
menu<00:02:58.310> has<00:02:58.519> been<00:02:58.670> split<00:02:58.879> into<00:02:59.090> kind<00:02:59.239> of<00:02:59.299> two

the apps that use kind of most

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:06.039 
the apps that use kind of most

network<00:03:48.370> you're<00:03:48.550> connected<00:03:48.940> to<00:03:49.090> it<00:03:49.660> can

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:49.810 
network you're connected to it can

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:51.479

and turn on and off Wi-Fi Bluetooth and

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:57.720 
and turn on and off Wi-Fi Bluetooth and
3g<00:03:55.090> and<00:03:55.780> get<00:03:56.080> straight<00:03:56.319> into<00:03:56.530> the<00:03:56.739> settings

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:57.730 
3g and get straight into the settings

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:00.990 
3g and get straight into the settings
from<00:03:58.600> there<00:03:59.160> so<00:04:00.160> it's<00:04:00.280> basically<00:04:00.459> the<00:04:00.730> same<00:04:00.940> as

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:01.000 
from there so it's basically the same as

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.400 
from there so it's basically the same as
you<00:04:01.180> would<00:04:01.239> find<00:04:01.480> on<00:04:01.599> an<00:04:01.720> android<00:04:01.989> phone<00:04:02.019> it

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:02.410 
you would find on an android phone it

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:06.180 
you would find on an android phone it
will<00:04:02.470> work<00:04:02.650> as<00:04:02.890> a<00:04:03.160> voice<00:04:03.730> device<00:04:04.150> and<00:04:05.190> broke

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:06.190 
will work as a voice device and broke

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:08.130 
will work as a voice device and broke

time scale of that that's obviously

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:19.370 
time scale of that that's obviously
depending<00:04:17.829> on<00:04:17.919> when<00:04:18.430> they<00:04:18.549> can<00:04:18.700> get<00:04:18.820> the

that positioning it for is internet
access<00:04:31.840> and<00:04:32.080> so<00:04:34.530> you<00:04:35.530> can<00:04:35.680> see<00:04:35.860> that<00:04:36.100> obviously

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:37.060 
access and so you can see that obviously

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:40.800 
access and so you can see that obviously
this<00:04:37.210> is<00:04:37.390> the<00:04:38.190> standard<00:04:39.190> Google<00:04:39.640> page<00:04:40.000> and<00:04:40.510> go

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:40.810 
this is the standard Google page and go

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:42.779 
this is the standard Google page and go
and<00:04:40.900> have<00:04:40.990> a<00:04:41.020> look<00:04:41.080> at<00:04:41.700> android<00:04:42.700> community

00:04:42.779 --> 00:04:42.789 
and have a look at android community

00:04:42.789 --> 00:04:45.270 
and have a look at android community
needs<00:04:43.300> here's<00:04:43.600> the<00:04:43.780> on-screen<00:04:44.620> keyboard

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:45.280 
needs here's the on-screen keyboard

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:49.409 
needs here's the on-screen keyboard
which<00:04:45.580> is<00:04:45.760> pretty<00:04:46.330> broad<00:04:46.750> for<00:04:47.530> a<00:04:48.419> handset

00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:49.419 
which is pretty broad for a handset

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:52.800 
which is pretty broad for a handset
that's<00:04:50.110> a<00:04:50.770> decently<00:04:51.160> sized<00:04:51.460> for<00:04:51.850> thumb<00:04:52.360> typing

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:52.810 
that's a decently sized for thumb typing

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:57.240 
that's a decently sized for thumb typing
and<00:04:53.500> there's<00:04:55.260> I'm<00:04:56.260> going<00:04:56.470> to<00:04:56.680> flip<00:04:57.039> with

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:57.250 
and there's I'm going to flip with

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:58.620 
and there's I'm going to flip with
accelerometer<00:04:58.000> which<00:04:58.060> it<00:04:58.240> doesn't<00:04:58.390> want<00:04:58.570> to

00:04:58.620 --> 00:04:58.630 
accelerometer which it doesn't want to

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:01.440 
accelerometer which it doesn't want to
do<00:04:58.750> but<00:04:59.440> there<00:04:59.860> is<00:04:59.979> a<00:05:00.190> portrait<00:05:00.880> out<00:05:01.210> there<00:05:01.390> we

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:01.450 
do but there is a portrait out there we

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:09.120 
do but there is a portrait out there we
got<00:05:01.570> portrait<00:05:02.050> mode<00:05:02.200> as<00:05:02.470> well<00:05:06.780> so<00:05:07.780> if<00:05:07.840> we<00:05:08.130> bring

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:09.130 
got portrait mode as well so if we bring

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:14.740 
got portrait mode as well so if we bring
that<00:05:09.280> back<00:05:09.580> can<00:05:10.390> have<00:05:10.570> a<00:05:10.600> look<00:05:10.750> at

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:14.750

slashgear

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:23.350 

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:26.760 

and<00:05:23.890> obviously<00:05:24.100> this<00:05:24.280> is<00:05:24.460> the<00:05:25.170> full<00:05:26.170> WebKit

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:26.770 
and obviously this is the full WebKit

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:27.870 
and obviously this is the full WebKit
browsers<00:05:26.800> will<00:05:27.160> just<00:05:27.340> go<00:05:27.430> and<00:05:27.490> have<00:05:27.610> a<00:05:27.640> look<00:05:27.700> at

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:27.880 
browsers will just go and have a look at

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:31.590 
browsers will just go and have a look at
the<00:05:29.250> full<00:05:30.250> slashgear<00:05:30.730> page<00:05:30.880> so<00:05:31.120> it's<00:05:31.240> the<00:05:31.420> the

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:31.600 
the full slashgear page so it's the the

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:32.760 
the full slashgear page so it's the the

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:32.770 
standard webkit browser that you would

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:34.890 
standard webkit browser that you would
find<00:05:32.980> on<00:05:33.130> a<00:05:33.340> regular<00:05:33.880> Android<00:05:34.240> handset<00:05:34.720> now

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:34.900 
find on a regular Android handset now

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:37.110 
find on a regular Android handset now
because<00:05:35.170> it's<00:05:35.320> running<00:05:35.980> 1.6<00:05:36.340> it<00:05:36.700> doesn't<00:05:36.970> have

because it's running 1.6 it doesn't have

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:44.020 
an issue you some people might argue it

an issue you some people might argue it
isn't<00:05:45.810> but<00:05:46.810> it<00:05:47.080> renders<00:05:47.470> quickly<00:05:47.920> you<00:05:48.370> can

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:49.620 
isn't but it renders quickly you can

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:53.450 
isn't but it renders quickly you can
double<00:05:50.620> tap<00:05:50.860> you<00:05:51.340> should<00:05:51.490> be<00:05:51.610> able<00:05:51.700> to

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:53.460 
double tap you should be able to

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:55.950 
double tap you should be able to
supposed<00:05:54.460> to<00:05:54.520> pinch<00:05:54.670> zooming<00:05:55.030> anyway<00:05:55.300> to<00:05:55.360> zoom

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:55.960 
supposed to pinch zooming anyway to zoom

00:05:55.960 --> 00:06:00.150 
supposed to pinch zooming anyway to zoom

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:00.160 
in reflow text around that so if we

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:05.520 
in reflow text around that so if we
happen<00:06:01.000> to<00:06:01.150> that<00:06:01.390> pretty<00:06:03.720> just<00:06:04.720> load<00:06:04.900> pretty

happen to that pretty just load pretty

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:07.650 
happen to that pretty just load pretty
quickly<00:06:05.860> and<00:06:06.130> look<00:06:06.670> just<00:06:06.970> like<00:06:07.060> they<00:06:07.240> would<00:06:07.360> on

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:07.660 
quickly and look just like they would on
