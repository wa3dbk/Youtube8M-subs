more of a spacious container type setup
where<00:00:35.910> you<00:00:36.450> know<00:00:36.540> I<00:00:36.570> had<00:00:36.840> a<00:00:36.870> little<00:00:37.170> leaf<00:00:37.380> in

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
where you know I had a little leaf in

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.139 
where you know I had a little leaf in
there<00:00:38.180> and<00:00:39.180> I<00:00:39.750> even<00:00:40.320> put<00:00:40.559> a<00:00:40.770> little<00:00:40.829> moist<00:00:41.579> ball

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
there and I even put a little moist ball

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:47.150 
there and I even put a little moist ball
of<00:00:42.450> tissue<00:00:43.760> to<00:00:44.760> keep<00:00:44.910> her<00:00:45.030> moist<00:00:45.180> and<00:00:46.160> the

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
of tissue to keep her moist and the

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.889 
of tissue to keep her moist and the
reason<00:00:47.460> I<00:00:47.550> decided<00:00:47.610> to<00:00:48.030> move<00:00:48.300> her<00:00:48.510> from<00:00:48.780> the

reason I decided to move her from the

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.970 
reason I decided to move her from the
test<00:00:49.140> tube<00:00:49.230> setup<00:00:49.590> was<00:00:50.219> because<00:00:50.640> I<00:00:51.949> knew<00:00:52.949> that

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
test tube setup was because I knew that

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.299 
test tube setup was because I knew that
in<00:00:53.550> the<00:00:53.640> wild<00:00:53.820> these<00:00:54.829> freshly<00:00:55.829> made<00:00:55.980> it<00:00:56.160> the

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
in the wild these freshly made it the

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.939 
in the wild these freshly made it the
elates<00:00:56.670> just<00:00:57.000> kind<00:00:57.210> of<00:00:57.270> like<00:00:57.510> hang<00:00:57.899> out<00:00:58.500> at<00:00:58.829> the

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
elates just kind of like hang out at the

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.150 
elates just kind of like hang out at the
bottom<00:00:59.219> of<00:00:59.370> the<00:00:59.460> leaf<00:00:59.899> in<00:01:00.899> a<00:01:01.020> tree<00:01:01.289> and<00:01:01.530> then

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
bottom of the leaf in a tree and then

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.920 
bottom of the leaf in a tree and then
they<00:01:02.340> lay<00:01:02.550> their<00:01:02.730> eggs<00:01:02.969> which<00:01:03.390> stick<00:01:03.690> to<00:01:03.840> the

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
they lay their eggs which stick to the

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.780 
they lay their eggs which stick to the
leaf<00:01:04.140> and<00:01:04.439> when<00:01:04.559> they<00:01:04.680> hatch<00:01:04.860> they<00:01:05.489> turn<00:01:05.670> into

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
leaf and when they hatch they turn into

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.920 
leaf and when they hatch they turn into
larvae<00:01:06.240> and<00:01:07.200> then<00:01:07.439> the<00:01:07.619> larvae<00:01:08.310> eventually

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:08.930 
larvae and then the larvae eventually

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:12.590 
larvae and then the larvae eventually
enable<00:01:09.930> her<00:01:10.290> to<00:01:10.320> create<00:01:10.830> a<00:01:11.010> silk<00:01:11.369> like<00:01:12.060> chamber

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
enable her to create a silk like chamber

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.350 
enable her to create a silk like chamber
for<00:01:12.840> herself<00:01:13.280> and<00:01:14.280> that's<00:01:14.400> how<00:01:14.700> she<00:01:14.760> creates

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
for herself and that's how she creates

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.570 
for herself and that's how she creates
her<00:01:15.479> claustral<00:01:16.110> chamber<00:01:16.470> so<00:01:16.650> I<00:01:16.680> figured

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
her claustral chamber so I figured

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.850 
her claustral chamber so I figured
unlike<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:18.509> cloth<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:19.110> fully<00:01:19.350> claustral

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
unlike the cloth the fully claustral

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.910 
unlike the cloth the fully claustral
ants<00:01:20.130> that<00:01:20.640> you<00:01:21.600> know<00:01:21.689> our<00:01:21.869> terrestrial<00:01:22.170> that

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
ants that you know our terrestrial that

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:23.929 
ants that you know our terrestrial that
fully<00:01:23.130> live<00:01:23.369> under<00:01:23.670> the<00:01:23.790> ground

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
subterrestrials I should say that prefer

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:28.850 
subterrestrials I should say that prefer
tight<00:01:28.200> quarters

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:46.009

than<00:03:41.890> room<00:03:42.070> temperature<00:03:44.010> here<00:03:45.010> in<00:03:45.280> my<00:03:45.760> room

than room temperature here in my room

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:50.220 
than room temperature here in my room
it's<00:03:47.640> the<00:03:48.640> temperature<00:03:48.970> varies<00:03:49.450> depending<00:03:50.049> on

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:50.230 
it's the temperature varies depending on

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:52.280 
it's the temperature varies depending on
whether<00:03:50.860> I<00:03:50.950> turn<00:03:51.250> on<00:03:51.430> the<00:03:51.730> air<00:03:51.850> conditioning

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
whether I turn on the air conditioning

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:56.819 
whether I turn on the air conditioning
up<00:03:53.290> there<00:03:53.760> or<00:03:54.760> whether<00:03:55.329> I<00:03:55.450> turn<00:03:55.720> it<00:03:55.810> off<00:03:55.959> but

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:56.829 
up there or whether I turn it off but

00:03:56.829 --> 00:03:59.520 
up there or whether I turn it off but
under<00:03:57.549> the<00:03:57.670> sink<00:03:58.000> it's<00:03:58.360> kept<00:03:58.780> away<00:03:59.019> from<00:03:59.049> all

00:03:59.520 --> 00:03:59.530 
under the sink it's kept away from all

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:02.599 
under the sink it's kept away from all
that<00:03:59.590> drastic<00:04:00.549> up-and-down<00:04:01.239> of<00:04:01.420> temperature

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:02.609 
that drastic up-and-down of temperature

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:07.349 
that drastic up-and-down of temperature
here<00:04:03.609> in<00:04:03.700> the<00:04:03.760> Philippines<00:04:04.209> it's<00:04:04.709> very<00:04:05.709> hot<00:04:06.359> so

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:07.359 
here in the Philippines it's very hot so

00:04:07.359 --> 00:04:10.110 
here in the Philippines it's very hot so
I<00:04:07.630> mean<00:04:07.900> the<00:04:08.140> species<00:04:08.560> is<00:04:09.190> built<00:04:09.549> for<00:04:09.820> warmer

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:10.120 
I mean the species is built for warmer

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.870 
I mean the species is built for warmer
temperatures<00:04:10.660> and<00:04:11.019> I<00:04:11.560> recognise<00:04:12.459> that<00:04:12.489> so

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:12.880 
temperatures and I recognise that so

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:14.880 
temperatures and I recognise that so
I've<00:04:13.390> been<00:04:13.540> trying<00:04:13.750> to<00:04:13.780> mimic<00:04:13.989> I<00:04:14.290> guess<00:04:14.590> what

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:14.890 
I've been trying to mimic I guess what

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:16.229 
I've been trying to mimic I guess what
she<00:04:15.040> would<00:04:15.190> be<00:04:15.220> going<00:04:15.459> through<00:04:15.579> in<00:04:15.850> the<00:04:15.940> wild

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:16.239 
she would be going through in the wild

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:18.690 
she would be going through in the wild
which<00:04:17.169> is<00:04:17.320> why<00:04:17.410> I<00:04:17.440> don't<00:04:17.739> mind<00:04:17.919> taking<00:04:18.130> her<00:04:18.489> out

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:18.700 
which is why I don't mind taking her out

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:20.370 
which is why I don't mind taking her out
here<00:04:19.209> in<00:04:19.359> the<00:04:19.479> light<00:04:19.660> to<00:04:19.870> show<00:04:20.019> you<00:04:20.079> guys

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:20.380 
here in the light to show you guys

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:23.400 
here in the light to show you guys
because<00:04:20.560> I<00:04:20.859> mean<00:04:21.039> in<00:04:21.280> the<00:04:22.120> wild<00:04:22.510> during<00:04:23.289> this

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:23.410 
because I mean in the wild during this

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:25.740 
because I mean in the wild during this
first<00:04:23.950> period<00:04:24.580> of<00:04:24.729> the<00:04:24.789> colony<00:04:25.360> founding

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:25.750 
first period of the colony founding

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:28.140 
first period of the colony founding
process<00:04:26.200> they're<00:04:26.530> up<00:04:27.250> in<00:04:27.370> a<00:04:27.460> tree<00:04:27.700> you<00:04:27.940> know

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:28.150 
process they're up in a tree you know

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:31.200 
process they're up in a tree you know
and<00:04:28.390> they<00:04:28.810> see<00:04:28.870> the<00:04:29.229> light<00:04:29.380> and<00:04:29.560> day<00:04:30.210> but

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:31.210 
and they see the light and day but

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:32.880 
and they see the light and day but
otherwise<00:04:31.479> if<00:04:31.750> this<00:04:31.960> was<00:04:32.169> just<00:04:32.200> the<00:04:32.590> normal

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:32.890 
otherwise if this was just the normal

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:35.400 
otherwise if this was just the normal
claustral<00:04:33.370> Queen<00:04:33.640> under<00:04:33.970> the<00:04:34.300> ground<00:04:34.479> I<00:04:34.900> would

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:35.410 
claustral Queen under the ground I would

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:37.110 
claustral Queen under the ground I would
probably<00:04:35.710> be<00:04:36.130> leaving<00:04:36.250> her<00:04:36.520> alone<00:04:36.789> for<00:04:37.030> the

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:37.120 
probably be leaving her alone for the

probably be leaving her alone for the
first<00:04:37.150> at<00:04:37.900> least<00:04:37.990> ten<00:04:38.560> days<00:04:38.909> but<00:04:39.909> I<00:04:40.090> just

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:40.300 
first at least ten days but I just

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:41.790 
first at least ten days but I just
wanted<00:04:40.510> to<00:04:40.659> create<00:04:40.810> this<00:04:40.960> update<00:04:41.320> video<00:04:41.470> to

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:41.800 
wanted to create this update video to

wanted to create this update video to
let<00:04:41.890> you<00:04:41.950> guys<00:04:42.070> know<00:04:42.250> that<00:04:42.510> she<00:04:43.510> does<00:04:44.080> have

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:45.080 
eggs

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:48.070 
eggs
and<00:04:45.199> the<00:04:45.830> colony<00:04:46.280> I<00:04:46.490> guess<00:04:46.699> is<00:04:46.939> well<00:04:47.780> on<00:04:47.930> its

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:48.080 
and the colony I guess is well on its

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:49.689 
and the colony I guess is well on its
way<00:04:48.139> it's<00:04:48.470> keep<00:04:48.710> our<00:04:48.860> fingers<00:04:49.159> crossed<00:04:49.250> and

00:04:49.689 --> 00:04:49.699 
way it's keep our fingers crossed and
