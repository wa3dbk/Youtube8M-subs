00:00:03.325 --> 00:00:05.999
 HIDDEN PAST -MASS EFFECT- 

00:00:10.522 --> 00:00:15.519
 For years he has lived a science fiction genre in films and television for a long time and bliss. 

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:18.082
 But in recent decades it has been games, 

00:00:18.098 --> 00:00:23.248
 that have brought this genre back to life by exploring the diverse worlds. 

00:00:23.256 --> 00:00:26.374
 The Mass Effect Trilogy Is Clearly Evident 

00:00:26.407 --> 00:00:31.764
 but it can surprise you where you can find links to various science fiction films. 

00:00:31.787 --> 00:00:37.715
 For example, when Commander Shepard orders drinks at the Mass Effect 2 at Citadel,â€¦ 

00:00:37.804 --> 00:00:39.875
 "Not a problem." 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.800
 "This ... is that green?" 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.720
 "And I'm sure it's gonna swipe with you." 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:48.777
 The sentence: "That's green" is a reference to Star Trek, 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.595
 with whom Mass Effect has a lot in common. 

00:00:51.626 --> 00:00:55.578
 This sentence has been used several times. First in the original series, 

00:00:55.594 --> 00:00:59.469
 when she uses her to try to get the alien villain drunk 

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:05.008
 and again in Star Trek: The Next Generation, where Data says the same to old Scotty. 

00:01:05.032 --> 00:01:13.095
 You probably know that Matriarch Benezia was spoken by Marina Sirtis, who played Counselor Troi in the "New Generation". 

00:01:13.111 --> 00:01:18.660
 But you probably don't know that the salarian in the Citadel Council is spoken by Armin Shimerman, 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:22.128
 who played a Ferengi in "Deep Nine". 

00:01:22.144 --> 00:01:26.560
 Linking these worlds was so strong that, according to developers, 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.520
 they had to throw the whole story out of the first game 

00:01:29.544 --> 00:01:34.647
 because in them the aliens were "too much like this Star Trek race." 

00:01:34.672 --> 00:01:38.751
 To date, no further information has been published. 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:47.951
 When we are at the 21st century, there are great links to the iconic Firefly series. 

00:01:47.975 --> 00:01:52.649
 Blue Suns mercenary group refers to Blue Sun corporation 

00:01:52.673 --> 00:01:58.284
 A society whose shadow and strong political influence can be seen in the series all the time. 

00:01:58.292 --> 00:02:01.347
 Although the Blue Sun from Firefly is not a mercenary group, 

00:02:01.371 --> 00:02:04.759
 both organizations share a reckless and mysterious nature. 

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:06.997
 That's not all they have in common. 

00:02:07.019 --> 00:02:10.622
 Both universes also have an event called "unifying war." 

00:02:10.646 --> 00:02:15.384
 In Mass Effect, it is a sign for the bitter Turian civil war. 

00:02:15.407 --> 00:02:18.230
 Firefly is a civil war between people. 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:22.099
 Another possible reference to Firefly is a planet called "New Canton", 

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:25.202
 it can be inspired by Canton from the series. 

00:02:25.225 --> 00:02:31.140
 Both planets are on the edge of the universe. Firefly fans might recall it as a planet, 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.000
 where they worship Jayna Cobb. 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.039
 Actor Jayna, Adam Baldwin, 

00:02:36.071 --> 00:02:40.290
 Kal Reegar, a mercenary of the Migration Fleet, spoke at Mass Effect 2. 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:45.686
 The BBC's "Master of Time" also has a small bark in the Mass Effect 3 Collector's Edition. 

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:48.908
 You can find a dog robot named Kei-9 there. 

00:02:48.932 --> 00:02:55.805
 Which will be a blink of a doctor's companion K-9 who has been appearing on the show since 1977. 

00:02:55.836 --> 00:03:00.040
 Mass Effect is a military science fiction situated in the distant future, 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:05.540
 and reflects contemporary military traditions. Normandy is a seagoing vessel 

00:03:05.547 --> 00:03:08.666
 and therefore no one is surprised that the guys from BioWare 

00:03:08.673 --> 00:03:12.779
 refer to "Submarine Hunt" not once but twice. 

00:03:12.811 --> 00:03:16.326
 When Joker activates a quiet drive in Normandy, he says: 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:20.519
 "He'll only reveal us by starting to sing the Russian anthem." 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:24.620
 So the Joker refers to the familiar scene where the submarine crew sings 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:28.790
 and is revealed by American sonar. Another allusion also says Joker, 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:32.358
 when he mentions that he sometimes wants to perform Mad Ivan. 

00:03:32.373 --> 00:03:36.445
 It's a naval maneuver that is known for the "Submarine Hunt". 

00:03:36.453 --> 00:03:44.627
 And not only does Joker attack this maneuver. Wash refers to him in the first episode of Firefly. 

00:03:48.667 --> 00:03:53.540
 Rough sci-fi game doesn't attack you first in connection with comedies, 

00:03:53.563 --> 00:03:58.309
 but the BioWare team loved one so much that it named the planet. 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:03.443
 In the DLC Leviathan you can find the Turian planet called "Triginta Petra". 

00:04:03.466 --> 00:04:08.704
 In Latin, "trigint" means "thirty", and in Greek, "petra" again "rock". 

00:04:08.743 --> 00:04:12.010
 Which refers to Tiny Fey's "Studio 30 Rock" series. 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:17.335
 During your walk at the Citadel, you probably visited the Dark Star salon a few times. 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:22.763
 This bar is believed to be named after John Carpenter's "Dark Star" movie, 1974, 

00:04:22.779 --> 00:04:27.810
 where the spaceship crew had an unusual task of destroying uninhabited planets. 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:31.286
 Many fans claim a lot of Ashley Williams 

00:04:31.302 --> 00:04:36.548
 that her name "Ash" coincides with the name of the main character "Deadly Greens". 

00:04:36.571 --> 00:04:43.372
 This is because he calls his hipster a "gun", just as it is in the "Dark Army". 

00:04:43.396 --> 00:04:47.943
 Developers love this scene so much that it has its own game mechanics. 

00:04:47.959 --> 00:04:53.784
 Next time, you can shout "boomstick" for Kin3 on Kinect, you'll see something interesting. 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:58.300
 So if you haven't saved Kaidan like me because Ashley is a racist. 

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:03.370
 Certainly you know Mass Effect, but perhaps you've learned a few things. 

00:05:03.378 --> 00:05:05.631
 Do you know other historical connections that we have not mentioned? 

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:08.845
 Share them in the comments and maybe they will be in other works. 

00:05:08.877 --> 00:05:13.003

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:19.274
 Thank you for seeing the Mass Effect Hidden History. 

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:24.340
 Why not look at the first episode that the unique commander, Shepard, spoke of? 

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:26.951
 Follow ShoddyCast on Twitter or on Facebook 

00:05:26.966 --> 00:05:33.411
 and on my Twitter "arhourigan" you can scold me for crushing the name of your favorite Star Trek character. 

00:05:33.435 --> 00:05:36.735
 And believe it or not, but this video needs to be calibrated.
