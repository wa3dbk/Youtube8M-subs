a<00:00:00.179> lot<00:00:00.690> of<00:00:00.719> people<00:00:01.050> have<00:00:01.140> been<00:00:01.230> asking<00:00:01.439> me<00:00:01.709> what

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:02.010 
a lot of people have been asking me what

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:03.800 
a lot of people have been asking me what
you<00:00:02.370> need<00:00:02.550> to<00:00:02.669> get<00:00:02.820> started<00:00:03.240> in<00:00:03.360> the<00:00:03.449> hobby<00:00:03.659> of

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:03.810 
you need to get started in the hobby of

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.130 
you need to get started in the hobby of
lock-picking<00:00:05.029> you<00:00:06.029> basically<00:00:06.450> only<00:00:06.960> need

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.140 
lock-picking you basically only need

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.140 
lock-picking you basically only need
three<00:00:07.379> tools<00:00:07.649> the<00:00:08.189> first<00:00:08.429> tool<00:00:08.700> is<00:00:08.730> a<00:00:08.849> tension

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
three tools the first tool is a tension

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.299 
three tools the first tool is a tension
wrench<00:00:09.480> this<00:00:09.690> is<00:00:09.840> a<00:00:09.870> must<00:00:10.200> for<00:00:10.650> any<00:00:10.860> kind<00:00:11.190> of

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
wrench this is a must for any kind of

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.419 
wrench this is a must for any kind of
picking<00:00:12.500> what<00:00:13.500> you<00:00:13.620> do<00:00:13.769> with<00:00:13.920> the<00:00:14.009> tension

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
picking what you do with the tension

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:19.250 
picking what you do with the tension
wrench<00:00:14.610> is<00:00:15.289> apply<00:00:16.400> pressure<00:00:17.400> on<00:00:17.609> the<00:00:17.850> plug<00:00:18.260> now

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
wrench is apply pressure on the plug now

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.470 
wrench is apply pressure on the plug now
before<00:00:20.250> you<00:00:20.400> can<00:00:20.550> actually<00:00:20.970> pick<00:00:21.180> the<00:00:21.300> lock

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
before you can actually pick the lock

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.170 
before you can actually pick the lock
you<00:00:22.380> need<00:00:22.590> to<00:00:22.740> know<00:00:23.250> which<00:00:23.580> way<00:00:23.789> the<00:00:23.970> plug

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
you need to know which way the plug

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.000 
you need to know which way the plug
turns<00:00:24.510> and<00:00:24.810> the<00:00:24.990> tension<00:00:25.350> wrench<00:00:25.529> is<00:00:25.650> in<00:00:25.769> set

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
turns and the tension wrench is in set

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.460 
turns and the tension wrench is in set
essential<00:00:26.730> in<00:00:26.789> determining<00:00:27.240> this<00:00:27.470> usually

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
essential in determining this usually

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.790 
essential in determining this usually
you<00:00:28.560> can<00:00:28.710> tell<00:00:28.920> by<00:00:29.130> the<00:00:29.519> amount<00:00:29.760> of<00:00:30.560> the<00:00:31.560> side

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
you can tell by the amount of the side

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.430 
you can tell by the amount of the side
that<00:00:32.009> gives<00:00:32.250> more<00:00:32.489> in<00:00:32.759> the<00:00:33.329> plug<00:00:33.570> when<00:00:34.410> you're

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
that gives more in the plug when you're

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.430 
that gives more in the plug when you're
applying<00:00:34.770> tension<00:00:35.989> if<00:00:36.989> not<00:00:38.059> you<00:00:39.059> can

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:39.440 
applying tension if not you can

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.770 
applying tension if not you can
determine<00:00:40.440> it<00:00:40.680> by<00:00:41.160> seeing<00:00:41.670> if<00:00:41.940> the<00:00:42.180> pins<00:00:42.450> will

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
determine it by seeing if the pins will

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.420 
determine it by seeing if the pins will
stick<00:00:43.050> or<00:00:43.200> not<00:00:43.230> and<00:00:43.620> that<00:00:43.829> brings<00:00:44.070> me<00:00:44.219> to<00:00:44.250> the

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
stick or not and that brings me to the

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.020 
stick or not and that brings me to the
next<00:00:44.610> tool<00:00:45.020> the<00:00:46.020> rake<00:00:46.340> in<00:00:47.340> this<00:00:47.550> case<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:47.910> head

straight this is the second tool that

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:36.799 

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:39.050 

that<00:01:37.799> case<00:01:38.009> we<00:01:38.189> didn't<00:01:38.340> lift<00:01:38.460> that<00:01:38.610> menu<00:01:38.850> so

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
that case we didn't lift that menu so

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:46.450 
that case we didn't lift that menu so
let's<00:01:39.299> go<00:01:39.420> to<00:01:39.479> the<00:01:39.600> other<00:01:39.720> side

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:46.460 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:52.670 

and<00:01:49.550> can<00:01:50.550> carry<00:01:50.820> a<00:01:50.850> couple<00:01:51.210> pins<00:01:51.450> dropping<00:01:51.900> so

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
and can carry a couple pins dropping so

and can carry a couple pins dropping so
this<00:01:52.890> is<00:01:53.040> probably<00:01:53.880> the<00:01:53.940> better<00:01:54.180> side<00:01:54.510> this

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
this is probably the better side this

this is probably the better side this
lock<00:01:54.960> will<00:01:55.110> open<00:01:55.170> on<00:01:55.470> each<00:01:55.620> side<00:01:55.860> but

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:56.960 
lock will open on each side but

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.210 
lock will open on each side but
clockwise<00:01:57.960> seems<00:01:58.260> to<00:01:58.410> be<00:01:58.500> the<00:01:58.650> better<00:01:58.800> side<00:01:59.040> on

00:01:59.210 --> 00:01:59.220 
clockwise seems to be the better side on

this lock the next tool that you'll need

this lock the next tool that you'll need
for<00:02:02.640> precision<00:02:03.540> picking<00:02:04.050> is<00:02:04.619> a<00:02:04.680> short<00:02:05.100> hook

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
the hook is used to lift each pin

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:14.660 
the hook is used to lift each pin
individually<00:02:11.700> and<00:02:13.040> you<00:02:14.040> can<00:02:14.250> feel<00:02:14.520> the

you will do it by one by one and you'll

you will do it by one by one and you'll
apply<00:02:20.880> a<00:02:20.970> small<00:02:21.239> amount<00:02:21.390> of<00:02:21.720> tension<00:02:21.900> before
