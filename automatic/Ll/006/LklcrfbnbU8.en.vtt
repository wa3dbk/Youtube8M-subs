00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:10.960
 a plastic tray a sponge for 

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:13.750
 the cut flowers of the pine branches of 

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:15.640
 moss of bent wire 

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:17.769
 hairpin are the basic elements 

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:19.779
 for the creation of our centerpieces 

00:00:17.769 --> 00:00:20.829
 the first thing to do is to mark the 

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:23.619
 our sponge 

00:00:20.829 --> 00:00:26.369
 at this point we are going to trim the 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:26.369
 our sponge 

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:36.170
 in order to form our circle that 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.170
 then we will start in the tray 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:45.220
 we cut almost in half 

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:52.850
 in this way the sponge must come out a 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:54.950
 centimeter and a half from the tank and then 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.480
 let's go round the whole for 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:59.890
 create uniformity 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.890
 in this way 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:03.559
 at this point our sponge is ready 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.960
 to create the basis for ours 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:09.530
 Christmas composition then we take 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:14.060
 a twig we remove the needles in this 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:15.580
 so we clean it well we do the tip e 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:20.540
 we don't end in our history 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:22.840
 in this way we do all the 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:22.840
 side dish 

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:34.850
 at this point we have to put the 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:40.940
 moss we go our musk onwards 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:44.330
 do n't finger me, we put it on the top 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:46.420
 our sponge covering all the well 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:52.700
 spaces 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:55.540
 in this way and then we fix it with the 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.540
 our wire 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:01.310
 so this is the basis for ours 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:03.200
 compositions we used the 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.610
 irpino moss that are ideal for 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.760
 our Christmas compositions 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:09.080
 I'm little thing bye, remember one 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:10.640
 very important thing 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.500
 soak the sponge in the water at least 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:15.730
 five minutes earlier because we have to 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.730
 use real plants
