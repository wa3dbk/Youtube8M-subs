00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
I already removed the three or three of

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.700 
I already removed the three or three of
the<00:00:20.279> four<00:00:20.550> pads<00:00:21.170> basically<00:00:22.170> what<00:00:22.350> you<00:00:22.470> want<00:00:22.650> to

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
the four pads basically what you want to

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.519 
the four pads basically what you want to
do<00:00:22.859> is<00:00:23.010> just<00:00:23.220> take<00:00:23.369> one<00:00:23.550> of<00:00:23.580> these<00:00:23.730> pads<00:00:24.000> off

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:24.529

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:27.920 
do is just take one of these pads off
underneath<00:00:25.529> should<00:00:25.949> be<00:00:26.099> a<00:00:26.369> screw<00:00:26.849> oh<00:00:27.150> also<00:00:27.660> the

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
underneath should be a screw oh also the

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.220 
underneath should be a screw oh also the
cooler<00:00:28.140> kind<00:00:28.470> of<00:00:28.529> looks<00:00:28.680> like<00:00:28.740> this<00:00:29.900> I'm<00:00:30.900> just

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
cooler kind of looks like this I'm just

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.979 
cooler kind of looks like this I'm just
removing<00:00:31.590> it<00:00:31.890> because<00:00:32.309> there's<00:00:33.300> so<00:00:33.510> much<00:00:33.690> dust

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
removing it because there's so much dust

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.400 
removing it because there's so much dust
in<00:00:34.230> it<00:00:34.410> and<00:00:35.210> it<00:00:36.210> doesn't<00:00:36.660> really<00:00:36.899> run<00:00:37.140> anymore

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
in it and it doesn't really run anymore

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.020 
in it and it doesn't really run anymore
and<00:00:37.710> they<00:00:37.770> can<00:00:37.950> actually<00:00:38.250> mix<00:00:38.430> my<00:00:38.579> computer<00:00:39.000> a

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
and they can actually mix my computer a

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.430 
and they can actually mix my computer a
little<00:00:39.149> bit<00:00:39.329> hotter<00:00:39.540> than<00:00:39.780> it<00:00:39.899> should<00:00:40.079> be<00:00:40.230> so

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
little bit hotter than it should be so

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.920 
little bit hotter than it should be so
I'm<00:00:41.340> just<00:00:41.489> taking<00:00:41.820> the<00:00:41.940> screw<00:00:42.180> out<00:00:42.420> it's

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
I'm just taking the screw out it's

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.600 
I'm just taking the screw out it's
actually<00:00:43.320> really<00:00:43.590> easy<00:00:43.620> with<00:00:44.040> disassemble

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
actually really easy with disassemble

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.930 
actually really easy with disassemble
these<00:00:44.760> as<00:00:45.480> I<00:00:45.690> found<00:00:45.870> out<00:00:46.110> later<00:00:46.379> on<00:00:46.940> inside

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
these as I found out later on inside

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.690 
these as I found out later on inside
here<00:00:48.329> and<00:00:48.680> these<00:00:49.680> parts<00:00:50.070> is<00:00:50.219> actually<00:00:50.670> a

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
here and these parts is actually a

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.700 
here and these parts is actually a
little<00:00:50.940> clip<00:00:51.300> that<00:00:51.329> cooks<00:00:52.020> on<00:00:52.199> to<00:00:52.410> the<00:00:52.500> side

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
little clip that cooks on to the side

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.279 
little clip that cooks on to the side
right<00:00:52.920> here<00:00:52.980> and<00:00:53.480> it<00:00:54.480> comes<00:00:54.539> out<00:00:54.960> like<00:00:55.110> this

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
right here and it comes out like this

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.560 
right here and it comes out like this
and<00:00:55.500> it<00:00:55.590> just<00:00:55.649> clamps<00:00:56.129> on<00:00:56.399> so<00:00:57.180> you<00:00:57.239> just<00:00:57.449> have

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
and it just clamps on so you just have

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:58.849 
and it just clamps on so you just have
to<00:00:57.600> be<00:00:57.780> careful<00:00:58.140> with<00:00:58.230> it

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
to be careful with it

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.299 
to be careful with it
push<00:00:59.309> it<00:00:59.489> a<00:00:59.520> little<00:00:59.550> bit<00:00:59.789> outward<00:01:00.239> and<00:01:00.680> then<00:01:01.680> it

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
push it a little bit outward and then it

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:03.260 
push it a little bit outward and then it
should<00:01:02.550> slide<00:01:02.789> right<00:01:03.059> out

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
should slide right out

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.630 
should slide right out
like<00:01:03.870> that<00:01:04.080> and<00:01:04.530> then<00:01:04.949> that<00:01:04.979> goes<00:01:05.400> for<00:01:05.610> the

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
like that and then that goes for the

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.910 
like that and then that goes for the
same<00:01:05.880> on<00:01:06.060> this<00:01:06.210> side<00:01:06.270> there's<00:01:06.900> the<00:01:07.260> same<00:01:07.500> clip

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
same on this side there's the same clip

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.280 
same on this side there's the same clip
on<00:01:08.130> this<00:01:08.369> side<00:01:08.580> so<00:01:08.850> if<00:01:08.970> you<00:01:09.000> just<00:01:09.180> push<00:01:09.450> it<00:01:09.479> I'm

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
on this side so if you just push it I'm

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.890 
on this side so if you just push it I'm
pushing<00:01:10.740> it<00:01:10.830> upward<00:01:11.250> in<00:01:11.369> this<00:01:11.520> way<00:01:11.700> so<00:01:12.420> to<00:01:12.479> work

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
pushing it upward in this way so to work

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.870 
pushing it upward in this way so to work
away<00:01:13.110> from<00:01:13.260> it<00:01:13.680> and<00:01:13.860> then<00:01:14.100> it<00:01:14.430> should<00:01:14.610> just

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
away from it and then it should just

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.840 
away from it and then it should just
come<00:01:15.090> out<00:01:15.920> and<00:01:16.920> it's<00:01:17.100> that<00:01:17.250> simple<00:01:17.430> so<00:01:17.820> just

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
come out and it's that simple so just

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.390 
come out and it's that simple so just
remember<00:01:18.210> there's<00:01:18.630> four<00:01:18.930> screws<00:01:19.409> and<00:01:19.920> little

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
remember there's four screws and little

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.190 
remember there's four screws and little
hooks<00:01:20.909> that<00:01:21.090> hook<00:01:21.450> it<00:01:21.720> in<00:01:23.030> and<00:01:24.030> to<00:01:24.780> get<00:01:24.960> it<00:01:25.080> out

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
hooks that hook it in and to get it out

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.719 
hooks that hook it in and to get it out
of<00:01:25.320> the<00:01:25.380> hook<00:01:25.530> you<00:01:25.680> just<00:01:25.860> push<00:01:26.070> it<00:01:26.189> upward<00:01:26.549> and

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
of the hook you just push it upward and

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.819 
of the hook you just push it upward and
here<00:01:27.240> I'll<00:01:27.330> just<00:01:27.360> show<00:01:27.479> you<00:01:27.600> what<00:01:27.810> I<00:01:27.840> mean<00:01:28.049> so

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
if you look over here there's like a

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.200 
if you look over here there's like a
hook<00:01:30.720> right<00:01:30.990> here<00:01:31.890> right<00:01:32.490> here<00:01:32.759> right<00:01:33.000> here

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
hook right here right here right here

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.920 
hook right here right here right here

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
and here so on all four sides just make

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.910 
and here so on all four sides just make
sure<00:01:37.110> you<00:01:37.200> don't<00:01:37.320> break<00:01:37.619> these<00:01:37.860> or<00:01:38.220> also<00:01:38.369> be

sure you don't break these or also be
hard<00:01:40.920> to<00:01:41.159> put<00:01:41.490> it<00:01:41.579> back<00:01:41.729> together<00:01:42.270> as<00:01:43.640> nothing

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
hard to put it back together as nothing

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.690 
hard to put it back together as nothing
will<00:01:44.759> lock<00:01:44.880> it<00:01:45.060> okay<00:01:45.869> yep<00:01:46.409> and<00:01:46.740> that's<00:01:47.130> it<00:01:47.280> so

here<00:01:54.210> the<00:01:54.450> screen<00:01:54.720> of<00:01:54.840> the<00:01:54.899> screw<00:01:55.140> here<00:01:55.380> this

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
here the screen of the screw here this

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:57.620 
here the screen of the screw here this
is<00:01:56.219> the<00:01:56.430> little<00:01:56.759> circuit<00:01:57.210> board<00:01:57.240> that

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
is the little circuit board that

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.719 
is the little circuit board that
controls<00:01:58.070> what<00:01:59.070> little<00:01:59.340> things<00:02:00.090> fans<00:02:00.780> do

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:01.729 
controls what little things fans do

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:06.289 
controls what little things fans do
which<00:02:02.729> is<00:02:02.880> spinning<00:02:03.290> and<00:02:04.640> this<00:02:05.640> red<00:02:06.030> wire

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
which is spinning and this red wire

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:10.430 
which is spinning and this red wire
controls<00:02:06.869> the<00:02:07.489> light<00:02:08.489> or<00:02:09.479> the<00:02:09.509> power<00:02:10.140> for<00:02:10.349> the

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
controls the light or the power for the

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.230 
controls the light or the power for the
light<00:02:10.910> yep

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:14.240 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:17.450 

all<00:02:15.240> right<00:02:15.510> so<00:02:15.930> that's<00:02:16.110> it<00:02:16.380> and<00:02:16.530> to<00:02:17.220> put<00:02:17.370> it

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:17.460 
all right so that's it and to put it

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.010 
all right so that's it and to put it
back<00:02:17.580> together<00:02:17.820> you<00:02:18.180> just<00:02:18.210> clip<00:02:18.510> it<00:02:18.540> back<00:02:18.810> on

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
back together you just clip it back on

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:21.200 
back together you just clip it back on
it<00:02:19.230> screw<00:02:19.440> it<00:02:19.470> and<00:02:19.920> then<00:02:20.220> put<00:02:20.790> the<00:02:20.910> screws<00:02:21.180> back

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:21.210 
it screw it and then put the screws back

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:24.680 
it screw it and then put the screws back
on<00:02:21.800> and<00:02:22.800> you're<00:02:23.160> done<00:02:23.370> and<00:02:23.850> that's<00:02:24.450> how<00:02:24.630> you

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
on and you're done and that's how you

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:32.900 
on and you're done and that's how you
just<00:02:24.930> assemble<00:02:25.410> the<00:02:25.530> mtech<00:02:25.980> cooler<00:02:28.640> yep<00:02:29.900> okay
