saw<00:02:27.950> this<00:02:28.099> contraption<00:02:29.380> realize<00:02:30.380> that<00:02:30.590> it's

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:30.709 
saw this contraption realize that it's

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:33.250 
saw this contraption realize that it's
quite<00:02:30.950> expensive<00:02:31.190> to<00:02:31.489> buy<00:02:31.760> as<00:02:32.330> a<00:02:32.390> unit<00:02:32.870> so<00:02:33.230> I

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
quite expensive to buy as a unit so I

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:34.330 
quite expensive to buy as a unit so I
thought<00:02:33.410> I'd<00:02:33.500> have<00:02:33.560> a<00:02:33.620> go<00:02:33.680> at<00:02:33.860> making<00:02:34.010> my<00:02:34.310> own

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
thought I'd have a go at making my own

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.910 
thought I'd have a go at making my own
so<00:02:35.150> I<00:02:35.209> bought<00:02:35.450> this<00:02:35.660> instruction<00:02:36.380> manual<00:02:36.410> for

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
so I bought this instruction manual for

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.850 
so I bought this instruction manual for
eBay<00:02:37.870> followed<00:02:38.870> the<00:02:38.959> instructions<00:02:39.560> step<00:02:39.830> by

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860 
eBay followed the instructions step by

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:44.680 
eBay followed the instructions step by
step<00:02:42.099> it's<00:02:43.099> quite<00:02:43.310> involved<00:02:43.580> but<00:02:44.150> it<00:02:44.330> took<00:02:44.480> me

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
step it's quite involved but it took me

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:47.890 
step it's quite involved but it took me
in<00:02:45.440> quite<00:02:45.680> a<00:02:45.709> few<00:02:45.769> days<00:02:46.130> I'm<00:02:46.910> guessing<00:02:47.480> it<00:02:47.660> cost

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900
