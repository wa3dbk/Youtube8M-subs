00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:04.589
 good morning everyone from home easy happy 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:06.450
 point 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:09.140
 today we see how the flowers are cleaned 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.140
 of pumpkin 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:20.340
 the first operation to remove the pay 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:23.010
 in this way after separating the stem 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.949
 from the filaments you take a small one 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:29.550
 portion of stem and descend slowly 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:33.859
 down like this e 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.859
 all filaments will be pulled away 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:46.530
 then the thalamus opens with the nails 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:48.239
 to see if there are insects inside 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.809
 just make a small one 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:55.250
 incision if there are insects in the light 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:58.640
 they will run away immediately and you will see them 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:58.640
 let's see the operation 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:44.069
 even the softest leaves can 

00:02:39.939 --> 00:02:46.780
 be used in the kitchen for 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:49.540
 use them as a roulade for others 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:55.959
 ingredients or in soups or even 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:58.540
 like omelettes in meatballs is a must 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:03:01.930
 the same procedure used for flowers 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:06.129
 a small piece of stem is broken 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:09.090
 of the leaf and then pulls us towards the 

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:12.909
 low in this way is finally 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:17.310
 all a piece of stem is removed 

00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:17.310
 and after a pull down 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:28.180
 yes in the lower part than in the part 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:28.180
 higher 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:22.450
 I remember that some zynga should be washed 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:25.900
 gently there is a project of the 

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:31.440
 fountain but it must really be a thread 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:34.440
 thin water so as not to 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:34.440
 ruin 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:47.090
 and after put upside down the way from 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:51.290
 lose as much as possible of 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:54.380
 water for this and other preparations 

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:58.550
 we look forward to seeing you on our website at 

00:04:54.380 --> 00:05:00.320

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:03.880
