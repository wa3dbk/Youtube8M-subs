00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.150 
has a good thing as an FM radio built
into<00:00:21.510> it<00:00:21.630> so<00:00:21.660> if<00:00:21.810> we<00:00:21.930> start<00:00:21.990> the<00:00:22.439> FM<00:00:22.890> radio

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
into it so if we start the FM radio

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.349 
into it so if we start the FM radio
applications<00:00:23.670> that<00:00:23.820> comes<00:00:23.970> with<00:00:24.150> the<00:00:24.210> phone

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
applications that comes with the phone

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.689 
applications that comes with the phone
because<00:00:24.930> it<00:00:25.109> pretty<00:00:25.529> much<00:00:25.650> does<00:00:25.920> exactly<00:00:26.519> what

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
because it pretty much does exactly what

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.450 
because it pretty much does exactly what
you'd<00:00:26.970> expect<00:00:27.090> an<00:00:27.810> FM<00:00:28.260> radio<00:00:28.439> applications<00:00:29.279> do

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
you'd expect an FM radio applications do

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.200 
you'd expect an FM radio applications do
make<00:00:30.179> sure<00:00:30.210> you<00:00:30.420> tune<00:00:30.810> in<00:00:30.929> to<00:00:30.990> the<00:00:31.109> radio<00:00:31.470> and

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
yeah that's pretty much all it does but

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.520 
yeah that's pretty much all it does but
let's<00:00:35.130> see<00:00:35.250> what<00:00:35.399> we<00:00:35.520> can<00:00:35.760> do<00:00:35.969> if<00:00:36.510> we<00:00:36.780> take

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
let's see what we can do if we take

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.560 
let's see what we can do if we take
exactly<00:00:37.950> the<00:00:38.129> same<00:00:38.309> phone<00:00:38.550> and<00:00:38.850> exactly<00:00:39.450> the

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
exactly the same phone and exactly the

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.780 
exactly the same phone and exactly the
same<00:00:39.750> hardware<00:00:40.260> but<00:00:41.190> we're<00:00:41.309> on<00:00:41.430> a<00:00:41.460> different

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
same hardware but we're on a different

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.250 
same hardware but we're on a different
kind<00:00:41.940> of<00:00:42.000> application<00:00:42.149> application<00:00:42.570> that<00:00:43.140> is

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
kind of application application that is

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.889 
kind of application application that is
aware<00:00:43.590> have<00:00:43.829> radio<00:00:44.160> dns<00:00:44.610> so<00:00:45.450> this<00:00:45.539> is<00:00:45.629> using

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
aware have radio dns so this is using

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.930 
aware have radio dns so this is using
exactly<00:00:46.320> the<00:00:46.440> same<00:00:46.649> FM<00:00:46.950> radio<00:00:47.280> and<00:00:47.489> it's

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
exactly the same FM radio and it's

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.690 
exactly the same FM radio and it's
changing<00:00:48.239> in<00:00:48.360> here<00:00:48.570> to<00:00:48.750> 96.3<00:00:49.559> FM<00:00:49.800> but<00:00:50.579> you'll

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
changing in here to 96.3 FM but you'll

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.130 
changing in here to 96.3 FM but you'll
see<00:00:50.910> what<00:00:51.090> it's<00:00:51.120> done<00:00:51.360> here<00:00:51.539> is<00:00:51.690> its<00:00:51.840> looked

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
see what it's done here is its looked

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.069 
see what it's done here is its looked
for<00:00:52.469> and<00:00:52.680> found<00:00:52.760> the<00:00:53.760> audience<00:00:54.210> PA<00:00:54.420> code<00:00:54.780> and

then<00:00:55.829> used<00:00:56.039> radio<00:00:56.340> Dennis<00:00:56.670> to<00:00:56.820> see<00:00:56.940> whether<00:00:57.149> or

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
then used radio Dennis to see whether or

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.459 
then used radio Dennis to see whether or
not<00:00:57.270> any<00:00:57.480> additional<00:00:57.899> content<00:00:58.230> is<00:00:58.350> available

not any additional content is available

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.650 
not any additional content is available
in<00:00:58.829> this<00:00:58.920> case<00:00:59.100> there<00:00:59.250> isn't<00:00:59.399> any<00:00:59.730> additional

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
two hot 99.5 here in Washington DC and

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.910 
two hot 99.5 here in Washington DC and
see<00:01:08.310> what<00:01:08.460> happens<00:01:08.729> when<00:01:09.240> you<00:01:09.420> get<00:01:09.540> up<00:01:09.689> to<00:01:09.920> 99.5
