00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
and feeling studies have shown that

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.330 
and feeling studies have shown that
rejection<00:00:12.809> is<00:00:13.139> really<00:00:13.740> not<00:00:13.860> that<00:00:14.099> far<00:00:14.309> removed

dire physical pain so science has told
us<00:01:35.400> what<00:01:35.670> we<00:01:35.939> basically<00:01:36.270> already<00:01:36.960> know<00:01:37.170> it

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
us what we basically already know it

us what we basically already know it
really<00:01:38.790> really<00:01:39.299> hurts<00:01:39.540> to<00:01:39.780> be<00:01:39.900> excluded<00:01:40.460> but

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
really really hurts to be excluded but

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.940 
really really hurts to be excluded but
like<00:01:41.729> we<00:01:41.880> said<00:01:42.119> being<00:01:42.689> rejected<00:01:43.049> well<00:01:43.590> that's

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
like we said being rejected well that's

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.940 
like we said being rejected well that's
a<00:01:44.040> part<00:01:44.250> of<00:01:44.310> life<00:01:44.369> so<00:01:45.180> what<00:01:45.570> do<00:01:45.630> we<00:01:45.689> do<00:01:45.930> how<00:01:46.890> do

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
a part of life so what do we do how do

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.859 
a part of life so what do we do how do
we<00:01:47.100> stop<00:01:47.399> from<00:01:47.610> feeling<00:01:48.000> so<00:01:48.030> crummy<00:01:48.570> when

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
we stop from feeling so crummy when

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.319 
we stop from feeling so crummy when
we're<00:01:49.020> left<00:01:49.170> out<00:01:49.520> the<00:01:50.520> best<00:01:50.790> way<00:01:51.000> to<00:01:51.030> counter

the<00:01:51.600> pain<00:01:51.780> of<00:01:51.899> rejection<00:01:52.020> is<00:01:52.560> to<00:01:52.829> seize

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
the pain of rejection is to seize

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.730 
the pain of rejection is to seize
control<00:01:53.280> in<00:01:53.880> deciding<00:01:54.390> how<00:01:54.689> to<00:01:55.020> react<00:01:55.470> to<00:01:55.500> it

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
control in deciding how to react to it

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.520 
control in deciding how to react to it
and<00:01:56.090> this<00:01:57.090> brings<00:01:57.540> us<00:01:57.750> to<00:01:57.930> our<00:01:57.960> well-cast
