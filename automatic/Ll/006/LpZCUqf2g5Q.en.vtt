00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:11.610
 I think the most difficult was probably after 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:14.250
 defeat the Black Sea coast team to withdraw from 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:20.010
 This state of Pskov why because 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:22.619
 that when all is well and it's good 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:26.730
 it was the hardest thing but trust him 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:30.150
 say that also had overwhelming 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.650
 advantage of almost the time created 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:37.410
 not a single moment we used 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:41.460
 Of course a lot of moment well, whether from 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:44.399
 nerves either wanted to score faster not 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:51.870
 I know well, at least create a moment 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:54.289
 the beam is already good therefore the most important thing 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.309
 now prepare somehow banners 

00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:58.890
 why like two after the third 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:02.010
 flight and need to play kazakhstan 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:05.280
 this is the most important second I think 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:10.460
 what is near and europe dynamo kiev 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:14.270
 cannot stay under any circumstances 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.270
 it's clear to me 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:19.799
 rita vray 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:23.700
 As you can see, for some reason, we have 3 Ukrainians 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:27.090
 I fell not foreigners Ukrainians 3 is 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.860
 hacheridi braked and gray all the more 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:32.490
 it is necessary to bear in mind that we are and the role of one 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:35.250
 Garmash composition fell about a month on 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:39.329
 four friends selin for another 6 month 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:43.590
 cruciate ligament hacheridi smaller 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:45.990
 the problem of maher darkness in iraq decided 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:49.079
 We decided to advise such as 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:51.899
 not and he said that better i will play 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:54.840
 I won't therefore have a problem with that 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:56.149
 though we do not want 4 Ukrainians need 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.619
 to put 

00:01:56.149 --> 00:02:03.590
 if we have what they said in what 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:03.590
 Ukrainians now probably had a shortage 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:10.780
 on the second we can with and who would probably 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:14.900
 play all the same 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:17.660
 any part of the Ukrainians or foreigners 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.700
 already a friend which we choose the option of the game 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:23.170
 the second 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:26.960
 we have information silver won 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:29.150
 took off for yesterday's game she didn't 

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:31.780
 indicative truth and what kind of 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.780
 there is information
