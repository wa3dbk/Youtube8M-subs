00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:05.850
 on 

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:12.079
 Hello everybody and welcome to a new edition of Games com Vicky's 

00:00:12.079 --> 00:00:15.330
 and let's take a look now it's one of the Creed Brotherhood's 

00:00:15.329 --> 00:00:17.619
 multiplayer-demo 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:20.619
 Of course you have the commercial character selection here 

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:29.999
 how can you choose your skills and characteristics the whole can 

00:00:29.999 --> 00:00:32.999
 Of course you can expand by leveling up 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:40.170
 and just a little bit the screen is explained on the top right 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.940
 is our goal that we have to do, including the number from one to one 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.080
 Of course, a point means a destination on the top left, the space is displayed 

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:53.050
 The position we have is clear at the beginning of March, however, will be first and the number 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:54.780
 the Chaser 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.670
 and then there's dirt Klose and he'll do it and there comes 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.490
 then also dirt points depending on how to do that, of course 

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:06.490
 several bonus points for her for example for the kilo 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.390
 while we find those goals yes why such a radar so it can be replaced 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.390
 Selection where he stands the track 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:24.050
 Zack and 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:25.950
 ste 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.710
 but if you do not flee fast enough then you will find one too 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:32.710
 but quickly the pursuer 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:39.980
 Jantscher and forced the ability and we can now 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:43.750
 Dressing up is our pursuer 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:46.870
 "He knows Alzey for the first time, and he's still on the radar 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:50.650
 but we are just different as in the picture 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:53.350
 the whole holds for a few seconds 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:57.330
 Of course, we can also make a lot of our group into life and you can relax 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:00.710
 I can see here and there we have our goals and do not believe 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:03.890
 watch out, "says the pursuer caught us 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.360
 real same already noticed erotic to take care of multiplayer Nishi 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:16.650
 simply that one is not SID Dr his victim now or his pursuer becomes it 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:21.180
 So nothing great does not display some of the hovering over and over 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.489
 Of course the game is definitely more entertaining so the multiplayer mode 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:28.000
 Definitely the end of the stairs variety 

00:02:36.669 --> 00:02:40.049
 because who cares now because Schneider and Peter delete I just hold the 

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:40.680
 whole 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:41.919
 instead of off 

00:02:41.919 --> 00:02:44.919
 yes, he thinks wrong when I kill a civilian 

00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:49.789
 To be lost you will be quoted and given a new one 

00:02:58.279 --> 00:03:01.109
 Of course you can be lucky now, the goal is a track in the speech 

00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:04.109
 and one he does 

00:03:08.419 --> 00:03:12.059
 Meanwhile, a pursuer is now conspicuous that means he jumps nearby 

00:03:12.059 --> 00:03:12.889
 above 

00:03:12.889 --> 00:03:17.559
 or print behind you then you have the chance to flee the chase 

00:03:17.559 --> 00:03:19.689
 is a track included here so you can see 

00:03:19.689 --> 00:03:23.839
 I dapd down and harden one on 4 4 percent in Iran 

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:35.919
 and in the end, of course, you get to see the table of course what you see 

00:03:35.919 --> 00:03:37.329
 has hired 

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:41.309
 can level up here, thereby building up his ability of course 

00:03:41.309 --> 00:03:44.240
 I found in multiplayer by Crysis Ines Creed Brotherhood 

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:45.759
 very interesting 

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:49.689
 as definitely something different and praises the city in the near future 

00:03:49.689 --> 00:03:52.189
 keep playing and definitely looking forward to being rolled up
