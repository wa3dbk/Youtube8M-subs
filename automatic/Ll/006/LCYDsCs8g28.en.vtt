call our treated for bonding material
and<00:00:44.420> what<00:00:45.080> we'll<00:00:45.200> do<00:00:45.320> in<00:00:45.440> this<00:00:45.560> case<00:00:45.770> is<00:00:45.950> we'll

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:46.100 
and what we'll do in this case is we'll

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.330 
and what we'll do in this case is we'll
take<00:00:46.250> our<00:00:46.430> dura<00:00:46.640> surf<00:00:47.110> UHMW<00:00:48.110> material<00:00:48.680> and

take our dura surf UHMW material and

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:51.310 
take our dura surf UHMW material and
we'll<00:00:49.460> actually<00:00:49.670> treat<00:00:50.240> it<00:00:50.420> where<00:00:50.990> it<00:00:51.080> can<00:00:51.170> be

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:51.320 
we'll actually treat it where it can be

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.650 
we'll actually treat it where it can be
bonded<00:00:51.560> with<00:00:52.130> a<00:00:52.160> variety<00:00:52.460> of<00:00:52.790> liquid<00:00:53.180> adhesive

this particular boat was actually done
in<00:04:23.020> a<00:04:23.230> two-stage<00:04:23.740> process<00:04:23.770> where<00:04:24.640> we<00:04:24.760> coated

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:25.090 
in a two-stage process where we coated

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:27.090 
in a two-stage process where we coated
the<00:04:25.180> ridges<00:04:25.570> first<00:04:25.870> and<00:04:26.169> then<00:04:26.440> we<00:04:26.620> went<00:04:26.800> back<00:04:26.919> a

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:27.100 
the ridges first and then we went back a

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:29.280 
the ridges first and then we went back a
second<00:04:27.610> time<00:04:27.640> and<00:04:28.090> actually<00:04:28.600> filled<00:04:28.990> in<00:04:29.140> the

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:29.290 
second time and actually filled in the

slats in between this is a duck boat or
a<00:04:32.140> jet<00:04:32.500> boat<00:04:32.710> which<00:04:33.310> actually<00:04:33.970> sees<00:04:34.210> a<00:04:34.240> lot<00:04:34.540> of

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:34.690 
a jet boat which actually sees a lot of

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:36.810 
a jet boat which actually sees a lot of
abuse<00:04:34.960> by<00:04:35.230> rocks<00:04:35.500> and<00:04:35.740> gravel<00:04:35.919> bars<00:04:36.280> so<00:04:36.700> they

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:36.820 
abuse by rocks and gravel bars so they

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:38.340 
abuse by rocks and gravel bars so they
want<00:04:37.000> to<00:04:37.090> complete<00:04:37.419> coverage<00:04:37.780> on<00:04:37.990> the<00:04:38.080> bottom

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:38.350 
want to complete coverage on the bottom

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:41.010 
want to complete coverage on the bottom
of<00:04:38.410> the<00:04:38.530> boat<00:04:39.450> alright<00:04:40.450> so<00:04:40.630> what<00:04:40.810> are<00:04:40.840> the

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:41.020 
of the boat alright so what are the

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:42.600 
of the boat alright so what are the
lessons<00:04:41.230> that<00:04:41.620> we've<00:04:41.860> learned<00:04:41.890> from<00:04:42.370> our

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:42.610 
lessons that we've learned from our

lessons that we've learned from our
video<00:04:42.940> series<00:04:43.419> today<00:04:44.040> obviously<00:04:45.040> number<00:04:45.220> one

video series today obviously number one
we<00:04:45.820> have<00:04:46.030> to<00:04:46.150> have<00:04:46.240> a<00:04:46.300> very<00:04:46.630> good

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:46.720 
we have to have a very good

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:49.140 
we have to have a very good
understanding<00:04:47.650> of<00:04:47.800> the<00:04:47.980> environment<00:04:48.150> that

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:49.150 
understanding of the environment that

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:51.150 
understanding of the environment that
our<00:04:49.330> product<00:04:49.720> is<00:04:50.020> going<00:04:50.290> to<00:04:50.350> be<00:04:50.440> exposed<00:04:50.950> to

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:51.160 
our product is going to be exposed to

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:53.310 
our product is going to be exposed to
this<00:04:51.970> is<00:04:52.120> going<00:04:52.330> to<00:04:52.390> determine<00:04:52.660> whether<00:04:53.110> we

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:53.320 
this is going to determine whether we

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:55.409 
this is going to determine whether we
use<00:04:53.350> a<00:04:53.500> pressure<00:04:53.830> sensitive<00:04:54.280> system<00:04:54.700> or<00:04:54.850> we<00:04:55.240> go

00:04:55.409 --> 00:04:55.419 
use a pressure sensitive system or we go

00:04:55.419 --> 00:04:58.080 
use a pressure sensitive system or we go
to<00:04:55.480> an<00:04:55.750> epoxy<00:04:56.080> system<00:04:56.650> but<00:04:57.250> either<00:04:57.370> way<00:04:57.669> that

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:58.090 
to an epoxy system but either way that

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:00.090 
to an epoxy system but either way that
is<00:04:58.300> going<00:04:58.480> to<00:04:58.630> determine<00:04:58.930> number<00:04:59.230> two<00:04:59.530> the

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:00.100 
is going to determine number two the

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:02.790 
is going to determine number two the
adhesive<00:05:00.669> selection<00:05:01.180> that<00:05:01.300> we<00:05:01.360> go<00:05:01.630> with<00:05:01.900> of

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:02.800 
adhesive selection that we go with of

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:04.680 
adhesive selection that we go with of
course<00:05:03.070> one<00:05:03.850> thing<00:05:04.030> we<00:05:04.120> always<00:05:04.330> have<00:05:04.570> to

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:04.690 
course one thing we always have to

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:06.900 
course one thing we always have to
remember<00:05:04.900> is<00:05:05.229> proper<00:05:05.830> surface<00:05:06.310> preparation

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:06.910 
remember is proper surface preparation

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:08.670 
remember is proper surface preparation
so<00:05:07.540> whether<00:05:07.750> again<00:05:08.080> you're<00:05:08.290> going<00:05:08.500> with<00:05:08.650> a

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:08.680 
so whether again you're going with a

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:10.800 
so whether again you're going with a
pressure<00:05:08.950> sensitive<00:05:09.370> system<00:05:09.760> or<00:05:10.270> a<00:05:10.330> product

that's treated for bonding making sure

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:14.219 
that's treated for bonding making sure
we<00:05:13.000> have<00:05:13.120> a<00:05:13.150> clear<00:05:13.479> understanding<00:05:13.510> of<00:05:14.080> how

00:05:14.219 --> 00:05:14.229 
we have a clear understanding of how

that service is to be prepped and also

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:18.150 
that service is to be prepped and also
making<00:05:16.720> sure<00:05:16.870> that<00:05:17.050> we<00:05:17.320> use<00:05:17.500> proper<00:05:17.890> pressure

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:18.160 
making sure that we use proper pressure

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:20.280 
making sure that we use proper pressure
whether<00:05:18.880> it's<00:05:19.090> with<00:05:19.270> a<00:05:19.360> roller<00:05:19.960> or<00:05:20.080> the
