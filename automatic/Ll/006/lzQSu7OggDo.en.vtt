next we're also going to need a

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.590 
next we're also going to need a
different<00:00:16.770> type<00:00:17.039> of<00:00:17.100> ink<00:00:17.400> and<00:00:17.609> specifically<00:00:18.539> a

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
catalyst to mix into that ink to bond to

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.170 
catalyst to mix into that ink to bond to
that<00:00:21.359> nylon<00:00:21.810> this<00:00:22.380> is<00:00:22.560> the<00:00:22.769> IC<00:00:23.160> 900<00:00:23.670> series<00:00:23.970> of

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
that nylon this is the IC 900 series of

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.420 
that nylon this is the IC 900 series of
nylon<00:00:24.600> ink<00:00:24.810> and<00:00:24.990> we<00:00:25.230> have<00:00:25.380> the<00:00:25.619> hot<00:00:25.769> 900<00:00:26.250> series

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
nylon ink and we have the hot 900 series

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.640 
nylon ink and we have the hot 900 series
catalyst<00:00:27.119> now<00:00:27.539> you<00:00:27.599> don't<00:00:27.900> have<00:00:28.109> to<00:00:28.289> use<00:00:28.500> two

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
catalyst now you don't have to use two

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.830 
catalyst now you don't have to use two
catalyst<00:00:29.099> with<00:00:29.519> specific<00:00:29.910> 900<00:00:30.330> series<00:00:30.510> inks

catalyst with specific 900 series inks

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.540 
catalyst with specific 900 series inks
you<00:00:30.960> can<00:00:31.199> use<00:00:31.380> it<00:00:31.500> with<00:00:31.590> any<00:00:31.740> plastic<00:00:32.219> salting

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
you can use it with any plastic salting

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.400 
you can use it with any plastic salting
but<00:00:33.030> it<00:00:33.120> does<00:00:33.300> work<00:00:33.540> best<00:00:33.809> for<00:00:34.050> long

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
but it does work best for long

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.680 
but it does work best for long

thick<00:00:50.700> this<00:00:50.969> catalyst<00:00:51.570> is<00:00:52.070> also<00:00:53.070> will<00:00:53.219> dry<00:00:53.489> out

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
thick this catalyst is also will dry out

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.189 
thick this catalyst is also will dry out
over<00:00:53.910> time<00:00:54.120> so<00:00:54.329> you<00:00:54.360> do<00:00:54.539> not<00:00:54.690> want<00:00:54.930> to<00:00:54.989> leave<00:00:55.110> it

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
over time so you do not want to leave it

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.889

on<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:55.350> shelf<00:00:55.379> tube<00:00:55.850> once<00:00:56.850> it's<00:00:57.030> mixed<00:00:57.300> in<00:00:57.629> all

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
on the shelf tube once it's mixed in all

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.360 
on the shelf tube once it's mixed in all
the<00:00:58.050> way<00:00:58.199> very<00:00:58.350> thoroughly<00:00:58.649> to<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:58.980> ink<00:00:59.160> your

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
the way very thoroughly to the ink your

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.250 
the way very thoroughly to the ink your
ink<00:00:59.550> will<00:00:59.730> harden<00:01:00.059> in<00:01:00.149> two<00:01:00.300> to<00:01:00.420> three<00:01:00.449> hours<00:01:00.600> so

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
ink will harden in two to three hours so

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.510 
ink will harden in two to three hours so
you<00:01:01.350> only<00:01:01.559> want<00:01:01.680> to<00:01:01.859> mix<00:01:02.010> up<00:01:02.190> what<00:01:02.399> you're

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
you only want to mix up what you're

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.009 
you only want to mix up what you're
going<00:01:02.699> to<00:01:02.760> use<00:01:02.850> and<00:01:03.300> you<00:01:03.420> do<00:01:03.570> want<00:01:03.719> to<00:01:03.750> use<00:01:03.899> it

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
going to use and you do want to use it

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:04.690 
going to use and you do want to use it
right<00:01:04.049> away

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:04.700 
right away

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:07.190 
right away
now<00:01:05.700> you<00:01:05.760> notice<00:01:06.150> this<00:01:06.270> ink<00:01:06.510> is<00:01:06.659> pretty<00:01:06.930> thick

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
now you notice this ink is pretty thick

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.859 
now you notice this ink is pretty thick
it's<00:01:07.380> whitening<00:01:07.740> first<00:01:08.070> of<00:01:08.220> all<00:01:08.400> and<00:01:08.700> it's<00:01:09.689> got

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
it's whitening first of all and it's got

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.179 
it's whitening first of all and it's got
that<00:01:10.049> catalyst<00:01:10.500> in<00:01:10.619> it<00:01:10.710> which<00:01:10.830> was<00:01:10.979> really

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
that catalyst in it which was really

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.550 
that catalyst in it which was really
thick<00:01:11.430> so<00:01:12.270> you<00:01:12.570> want<00:01:12.780> to<00:01:12.869> use<00:01:12.960> a<00:01:13.020> low<00:01:13.229> mesh

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
thick so you want to use a low mesh

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.499 
thick so you want to use a low mesh
we're<00:01:13.770> going<00:01:13.890> to<00:01:13.950> be<00:01:14.010> using<00:01:14.310> a<00:01:14.400> 110<00:01:14.939> mesh<00:01:15.210> on

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
we're going to be using a 110 mesh on

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.560 
we're going to be using a 110 mesh on
this<00:01:16.380> print<00:01:16.799> go<00:01:17.520> ahead<00:01:17.640> and<00:01:17.729> load<00:01:17.909> the<00:01:18.090> jacket

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
this print go ahead and load the jacket

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.149 
this print go ahead and load the jacket
want<00:01:19.500> to<00:01:19.560> get<00:01:19.650> that<00:01:19.799> on<00:01:19.890> straight<00:01:20.280> of<00:01:20.400> course

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:22.159 
want to get that on straight of course

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:25.690 
want to get that on straight of course
make<00:01:23.159> sure<00:01:23.369> the<00:01:23.490> print<00:01:23.759> lined<00:01:24.030> up<00:01:24.210> correctly

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:25.700 
make sure the print lined up correctly

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.760 
make sure the print lined up correctly
now<00:01:26.700> this<00:01:27.420> jacket<00:01:27.869> does<00:01:28.020> not<00:01:28.229> have<00:01:28.530> any

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
now this jacket does not have any

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.920 
now this jacket does not have any
waterproofing<00:01:29.520> on<00:01:29.700> it<00:01:29.850> there<00:01:30.479> are<00:01:30.630> some

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
waterproofing on it there are some

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.660 
waterproofing on it there are some
jackets<00:01:31.380> that<00:01:31.439> do<00:01:31.650> have<00:01:31.829> waterproofing<00:01:32.490> on
