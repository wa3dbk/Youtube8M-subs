00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:30.030 

as<00:01:26.950> I<00:01:27.610> fill<00:01:28.180> the<00:01:28.360> teapot<00:01:28.600> I<00:01:29.200> want<00:01:29.620> to<00:01:29.770> think

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:30.040 
as I fill the teapot I want to think

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:32.580 
as I fill the teapot I want to think
very<00:01:30.340> delicate<00:01:31.150> and<00:01:31.180> tiny<00:01:31.659> certainly<00:01:32.440> don't

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:32.590 
very delicate and tiny certainly don't

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:35.219 
very delicate and tiny certainly don't
want<00:01:32.800> to<00:01:32.890> overpower<00:01:33.610> so<00:01:34.479> cutting<00:01:34.750> it<00:01:34.930> quite

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:35.229 
want to overpower so cutting it quite

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:37.890 
want to overpower so cutting it quite
short<00:01:35.710> and<00:01:36.070> then<00:01:36.610> just<00:01:36.850> setting<00:01:37.180> it<00:01:37.300> down<00:01:37.330> in

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:37.900 
short and then just setting it down in

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:39.570 
short and then just setting it down in
letting<00:01:38.619> it<00:01:38.710> break<00:01:38.950> the<00:01:39.010> line<00:01:39.340> of<00:01:39.520> the

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:39.580 
letting it break the line of the

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:44.090 
letting it break the line of the
container<00:01:40.030> naturally<00:01:40.869> by<00:01:41.200> draping<00:01:41.560> across

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.100 

and<00:01:45.100> repeating<00:01:45.820> that<00:01:45.970> again<00:01:46.540> going<00:01:46.810> in<00:01:47.020> the

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:47.110 
and repeating that again going in the

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:49.499 
and repeating that again going in the
opposite<00:01:47.590> direction<00:01:47.740> so<00:01:48.070> I'm<00:01:48.280> creating<00:01:49.270> a

00:01:49.499 --> 00:01:49.509 
opposite direction so I'm creating a

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:52.710 
opposite direction so I'm creating a
crossing<00:01:50.290> of<00:01:50.950> all<00:01:51.190> the<00:01:51.400> stems<00:01:51.729> which<00:01:52.509> will

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:52.720 
crossing of all the stems which will

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:55.530 
crossing of all the stems which will
then<00:01:52.900> support<00:01:53.200> the<00:01:53.770> things<00:01:54.070> in<00:01:54.369> the<00:01:54.490> center<00:01:54.970> so

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:55.540 
then support the things in the center so

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:57.960 
then support the things in the center so
I've<00:01:55.659> crossed<00:01:56.170> through<00:01:56.800> creating<00:01:57.580> a<00:01:57.700> weave

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:57.970 
I've crossed through creating a weave

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:01.139 
I've crossed through creating a weave
then<00:01:58.690> I<00:01:58.720> can<00:01:58.990> go<00:01:59.110> back<00:01:59.320> and<00:01:59.710> add<00:02:00.310> things<00:02:00.820> that

00:02:01.139 --> 00:02:01.149 
then I can go back and add things that

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:03.690 
then I can go back and add things that
go<00:02:01.300> up<00:02:01.630> right<00:02:02.050> through<00:02:02.470> the<00:02:02.649> center<00:02:03.130> because

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:03.700 
go up right through the center because

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:05.460 
go up right through the center because
the<00:02:03.880> other<00:02:04.060> flowers<00:02:04.630> will<00:02:04.869> hold<00:02:05.110> them<00:02:05.320> in

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:05.470 
the other flowers will hold them in

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:06.109 
the other flowers will hold them in
place

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
place

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.790 
place
so<00:02:07.119> the<00:02:07.240> lily-of-the-valley<00:02:07.570> can<00:02:08.350> come<00:02:08.560> right

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:08.800 
so the lily-of-the-valley can come right

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.759 
so the lily-of-the-valley can come right
up<00:02:09.070> oh<00:02:09.250> so<00:02:09.940> fragrant<00:02:10.420> and<00:02:10.450> fabulous<00:02:10.769> the

00:02:11.759 --> 00:02:11.769 
up oh so fragrant and fabulous the

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:16.910

muscari<00:02:12.280> maybe<00:02:13.150> bring<00:02:13.480> it<00:02:13.630> out<00:02:13.780> to<00:02:13.959> the<00:02:14.110> side

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.560 

and<00:02:17.920> then<00:02:18.100> working<00:02:18.370> it<00:02:18.670> up<00:02:18.850> towards<00:02:19.360> the

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:19.570 
and then working it up towards the

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:23.430 
and then working it up towards the
center<00:02:20.050> as<00:02:20.230> well<00:02:20.470> bringing<00:02:21.459> that<00:02:21.640> color<00:02:21.910> in<00:02:22.440> in

crossing<00:02:29.050> through<00:02:29.830> weaving<00:02:30.790> letting<00:02:31.600> it<00:02:31.690> be

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
crossing through weaving letting it be

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:35.580 
crossing through weaving letting it be
very<00:02:32.130> casual<00:02:33.130> don't<00:02:34.120> want<00:02:34.329> it<00:02:34.480> to<00:02:34.660> be<00:02:34.840> formal

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.150 
flip out if I wasn't careful but I just

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:03.910 
flip out if I wasn't careful but I just

about<00:03:08.930> the<00:03:09.140> weaving<00:03:09.680> because<00:03:10.280> the<00:03:10.460> foam<00:03:10.700> is

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:10.940 
about the weaving because the foam is
