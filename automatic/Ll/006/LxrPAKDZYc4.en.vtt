00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:12.390 
hey guys what's up today we're gonna be

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:14.030 
hey guys what's up today we're gonna be
doing<00:00:12.690> a<00:00:12.780> quick<00:00:12.930> comparison<00:00:13.170> between<00:00:13.650> the

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
doing a quick comparison between the

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.390 
doing a quick comparison between the
Samsung<00:00:14.400> and<00:00:15.030> series<00:00:15.510> 7<00:00:15.950> 15.6<00:00:16.950> inch<00:00:17.100> notebook

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
Samsung and series 7 15.6 inch notebook

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.780 
Samsung and series 7 15.6 inch notebook
and<00:00:17.790> the<00:00:18.390> mid<00:00:18.660> 2012<00:00:19.380> 13<00:00:19.980> inch<00:00:20.130> MacBook<00:00:20.369> Pro

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:20.790 
and the mid 2012 13 inch MacBook Pro

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:24.890 
and the mid 2012 13 inch MacBook Pro
basic<00:00:21.240> model<00:00:23.480> Ryan's<00:00:24.480> gonna<00:00:24.540> take<00:00:24.779> you<00:00:24.840> from

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
basic model Ryan's gonna take you from

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.480 
basic model Ryan's gonna take you from
here<00:00:24.990> all<00:00:25.860> right<00:00:25.950> so<00:00:26.040> we're<00:00:26.160> just<00:00:26.189> gonna<00:00:26.340> start

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
here all right so we're just gonna start

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.359 
here all right so we're just gonna start
out<00:00:26.730> with<00:00:26.759> a<00:00:26.910> quick<00:00:27.360> spec<00:00:27.810> comparison<00:00:28.439> we<00:00:29.220> got

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
out with a quick spec comparison we got

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.790 
out with a quick spec comparison we got
the<00:00:29.640> information<00:00:30.570> pulled<00:00:30.840> up<00:00:30.989> on<00:00:31.169> the<00:00:31.290> systems

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
the information pulled up on the systems

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.710 
the information pulled up on the systems
so<00:00:33.260> basically<00:00:34.260> what<00:00:34.530> you<00:00:34.650> got<00:00:34.920> over<00:00:35.340> here<00:00:35.720> core

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:36.720 
so basically what you got over here core

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:41.270 
so basically what you got over here core
i7<00:00:38.000> 2.3<00:00:39.000> gigahertz<00:00:39.110> it<00:00:40.110> runs<00:00:40.560> with<00:00:40.770> 4<00:00:41.040> cores

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
i7 2.3 gigahertz it runs with 4 cores

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.710 
i7 2.3 gigahertz it runs with 4 cores
and<00:00:41.610> hyper<00:00:41.790> threading<00:00:42.240> so<00:00:42.360> you<00:00:42.450> have<00:00:42.540> 8

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:42.720 
and hyper threading so you have 8

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:44.750 
and hyper threading so you have 8
virtual<00:00:43.170> cores<00:00:43.440> which<00:00:43.680> is<00:00:43.830> like<00:00:44.070> insane

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
virtual cores which is like insane

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.630 
virtual cores which is like insane
compared<00:00:45.180> to<00:00:45.270> the<00:00:45.330> MacBook<00:00:45.750> cuz<00:00:46.020> you<00:00:46.950> got<00:00:47.130> not

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
compared to the MacBook cuz you got not

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.540 
compared to the MacBook cuz you got not
only<00:00:47.670> the<00:00:48.210> two<00:00:48.420> more<00:00:48.720> cores<00:00:48.990> but<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:49.650> virtual

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
only the two more cores but the virtual

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.970 
only the two more cores but the virtual
cores<00:00:50.790> as<00:00:50.940> well<00:00:51.120> so<00:00:51.480> and<00:00:51.720> then<00:00:52.350> eight

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
cores as well so and then eight

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.050 
cores as well so and then eight
gigabytes<00:00:53.520> of<00:00:53.700> ddr3<00:00:54.090> ram<00:00:54.570> and<00:00:56.060> integrated

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:57.060 
gigabytes of ddr3 ram and integrated

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:59.270 
gigabytes of ddr3 ram and integrated
graphics<00:00:57.240> alright<00:00:58.140> so<00:00:58.560> as<00:00:58.800> you<00:00:58.860> can<00:00:59.220> see

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
graphics alright so as you can see

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.250 
graphics alright so as you can see
pretty<00:00:59.730> much<00:00:59.850> we<00:01:00.240> brought<00:01:00.420> my<00:01:00.540> brother<00:01:00.810> into

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
regular hard drive alright so this video

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.359 
regular hard drive alright so this video
is<00:01:57.659> gonna<00:01:57.750> be<00:01:57.869> mainly<00:01:58.170> focused<00:01:58.770> on<00:01:58.920> the

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
is gonna be mainly focused on the

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.550 
is gonna be mainly focused on the
hardware<00:01:59.760> because<00:02:00.000> most<00:02:00.960> of<00:02:01.110> you<00:02:01.200> know<00:02:01.380> the

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
hardware because most of you know the

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.649 
hardware because most of you know the
differences<00:02:02.010> between<00:02:02.159> Windows<00:02:02.940> and<00:02:03.270> Mac

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
differences between Windows and Mac

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.510 
differences between Windows and Mac
we'll<00:02:04.530> touch<00:02:04.770> on<00:02:04.890> it<00:02:05.040> a<00:02:05.100> little<00:02:05.340> bit

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
we'll touch on it a little bit

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.630 
we'll touch on it a little bit
throughout<00:02:05.850> but<00:02:06.330> it's<00:02:06.780> mainly

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640 
throughout but it's mainly

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:14.020 
throughout but it's mainly
we<00:02:07.850> ran<00:02:08.090> some<00:02:08.360> speed<00:02:10.900> testing<00:02:11.900> them<00:02:12.380> down<00:02:13.030> we

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
we ran some speed testing them down we

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.180 
we ran some speed testing them down we
had<00:02:14.150> a<00:02:14.180> little<00:02:14.330> I<00:02:14.660> didn't<00:02:15.590> realize<00:02:15.800> you<00:02:15.920> had<00:02:15.950> up

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
had a little I didn't realize you had up

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:18.880 
had a little I didn't realize you had up
on<00:02:16.370> the<00:02:16.459> Mac<00:02:16.700> but<00:02:17.380> alright<00:02:18.380> the<00:02:18.470> math<00:02:18.620> down

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
on the Mac but alright the math down

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:20.770 
on the Mac but alright the math down

the PC has not open iTunes yet but it's
not<00:06:12.020> a<00:06:12.050> native<00:06:12.350> program<00:06:12.710> again<00:06:13.450> so<00:06:14.450> you've<00:06:14.780> got

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:15.020 
not a native program again so you've got

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:16.930 
not a native program again so you've got
the<00:06:15.770> full<00:06:15.980> size<00:06:16.220> keyboard<00:06:16.460> with<00:06:16.670> a<00:06:16.760> number-pad

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:16.940 
the full size keyboard with a number-pad

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:20.620 
the full size keyboard with a number-pad
over<00:06:17.930> here<00:06:18.200> no<00:06:18.560> number<00:06:18.860> pad<00:06:19.040> over<00:06:19.190> there<00:06:19.340> but<00:06:19.630> I

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:20.630 
over here no number pad over there but I

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:22.870 
over here no number pad over there but I
personally<00:06:21.560> have<00:06:21.740> never<00:06:21.890> used<00:06:22.280> that<00:06:22.370> and

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:22.880 
personally have never used that and

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:24.460 
personally have never used that and
they're<00:06:23.120> both<00:06:23.210> chiclet<00:06:23.600> style<00:06:23.630> with<00:06:23.990> backlit

they're both chiclet style with backlit

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:26.290 
they're both chiclet style with backlit

so that's a nice feature just makes it

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:28.470 
so that's a nice feature just makes it
more<00:06:26.570> of<00:06:26.660> a<00:06:26.720> premium<00:06:27.080> feel<00:06:27.380> when<00:06:27.560> you<00:06:27.680> use<00:06:27.710> it

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:28.480 
more of a premium feel when you use it

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:18.610
