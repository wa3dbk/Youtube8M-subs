with like a comb or anything like that

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.530 
with like a comb or anything like that
it<00:01:17.009> gets<00:01:17.310> really<00:01:17.580> bushy<00:01:17.880> time<00:01:18.150> previously

it gets really bushy time previously

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:19.969 
it gets really bushy time previously
that<00:01:18.720> I<00:01:18.780> don't<00:01:19.049> like<00:01:19.170> to<00:01:19.290> use<00:01:19.320> a<00:01:19.439> lot<00:01:19.619> of<00:01:19.650> cones

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
that I don't like to use a lot of cones

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.550 
that I don't like to use a lot of cones
on<00:01:20.189> my<00:01:20.310> hair<00:01:20.549> because<00:01:20.729> it<00:01:21.119> destroys<00:01:21.869> my<00:01:22.140> coils

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
on my hair because it destroys my coils

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.950 
on my hair because it destroys my coils
so<00:01:22.979> I<00:01:23.009> then<00:01:23.490> would<00:01:23.670> have<00:01:23.909> to<00:01:24.119> work<00:01:24.360> really<00:01:24.840> hard

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.280 
so I then would have to work really hard
to<00:01:25.229> recreate<00:01:25.710> my<00:01:25.920> coils<00:01:26.310> with<00:01:26.430> like<00:01:26.580> a<00:01:26.610> gel<00:01:26.970> or

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:27.290 
to recreate my coils with like a gel or

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:44.090 
know cutting too much one side can use a

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:45.520

00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:01.740 
again I'm not planning on wearing this

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:02.990 
again I'm not planning on wearing this
but<00:07:01.920> i<00:07:01.950> just<00:07:02.130> want<00:07:02.250> to<00:07:02.280> show<00:07:02.460> you<00:07:02.520> what<00:07:02.910> it

00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:03.000 
but i just want to show you what it

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:04.040 
but i just want to show you what it
looked<00:07:03.210> like<00:07:03.300> just<00:07:03.510> in<00:07:03.660> case<00:07:03.810> you<00:07:03.960> were

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:04.050 
looked like just in case you were

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:05.540 
looked like just in case you were
interested<00:07:04.080> in<00:07:04.650> trying<00:07:04.860> those<00:07:05.040> two<00:07:05.160> products

00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:05.550 
interested in trying those two products

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:07.250 
interested in trying those two products
i<00:07:05.610> guess<00:07:05.790> i'm<00:07:05.940> all<00:07:06.120> done<00:07:06.240> unravel<00:07:06.780> my<00:07:06.900> hair<00:07:07.110> and

00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:07.260 
i guess i'm all done unravel my hair and

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:10.840 
i guess i'm all done unravel my hair and
you<00:07:07.860> can<00:07:07.980> see<00:07:08.250> it's<00:07:08.580> still<00:07:08.910> pretty<00:07:09.120> defined

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:10.850 
you can see it's still pretty defined

00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:14.600 
you can see it's still pretty defined
where<00:07:11.850> my<00:07:12.410> shorter<00:07:13.410> area<00:07:13.770> is<00:07:13.950> temperature

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:14.610 
where my shorter area is temperature

00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:16.250 
where my shorter area is temperature
today<00:07:14.760> it's<00:07:15.000> going<00:07:15.120> to<00:07:15.210> be<00:07:15.270> in<00:07:15.510> the<00:07:15.660> low<00:07:15.810> 80s

00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:16.260 
today it's going to be in the low 80s

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:18.530 
today it's going to be in the low 80s
with<00:07:16.800> like<00:07:17.010> the<00:07:17.130> humidity<00:07:17.580> at<00:07:17.760> about<00:07:17.970> 82

00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:18.540 
with like the humidity at about 82

00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:20.390 
with like the humidity at about 82
percent<00:07:19.110> so<00:07:19.380> there's<00:07:19.710> a<00:07:19.770> big<00:07:19.920> chance<00:07:20.100> that<00:07:20.220> my

00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:20.400 
percent so there's a big chance that my

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:22.280 
percent so there's a big chance that my
hair<00:07:20.580> is<00:07:20.610> one<00:07:20.760> of<00:07:20.880> ferns<00:07:21.300> up<00:07:21.450> again<00:07:21.720> so<00:07:22.140> before

00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:22.290 
hair is one of ferns up again so before

00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:23.960 
hair is one of ferns up again so before
i<00:07:22.470> turned<00:07:22.800> my<00:07:22.920> hair<00:07:23.130> i<00:07:23.160> actually<00:07:23.700> had<00:07:23.880> my

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:23.970 
i turned my hair i actually had my

00:07:23.970 --> 00:07:25.730 
i turned my hair i actually had my
husband<00:07:24.300> measured<00:07:24.600> for<00:07:24.810> me<00:07:24.930> and<00:07:25.200> it<00:07:25.620> was

00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:25.740 
husband measured for me and it was

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:27.380 
husband measured for me and it was
hidden<00:07:25.980> at<00:07:26.130> about<00:07:26.370> like<00:07:26.400> eight<00:07:26.790> inches<00:07:27.150> in<00:07:27.300> my

00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:27.390 
hidden at about like eight inches in my

00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:30.410 
hidden at about like eight inches in my
bangs<00:07:27.600> um<00:07:28.010> one<00:07:29.010> side<00:07:29.280> was<00:07:29.640> about<00:07:30.030> eight<00:07:30.240> and<00:07:30.270> a

00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:30.420 
bangs um one side was about eight and a

00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:32.120 
bangs um one side was about eight and a
half<00:07:30.450> inches<00:07:30.810> long<00:07:31.200> which<00:07:31.560> was<00:07:31.680> like<00:07:31.800> my<00:07:31.950> right

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:32.130 
half inches long which was like my right

00:07:32.130 --> 00:07:33.980 
half inches long which was like my right
side<00:07:32.310> and<00:07:32.580> my<00:07:32.940> left<00:07:32.970> side<00:07:33.330> was<00:07:33.540> a<00:07:33.570> little<00:07:33.870> bit

00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:33.990 
side and my left side was a little bit

00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:35.510 
side and my left side was a little bit
shorter<00:07:34.170> than<00:07:34.470> that<00:07:34.500> and<00:07:34.860> it's<00:07:35.130> kind<00:07:35.340> of<00:07:35.400> been

00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:35.520 
shorter than that and it's kind of been

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:37.670 
shorter than that and it's kind of been
doing<00:07:35.790> that<00:07:35.970> since<00:07:36.960> the<00:07:37.170> beginning<00:07:37.470> of<00:07:37.560> my

00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:37.680 
doing that since the beginning of my

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:39.680 
doing that since the beginning of my
journey<00:07:37.740> I<00:07:38.220> sleep<00:07:38.700> on<00:07:38.880> my<00:07:39.030> left<00:07:39.270> side<00:07:39.330> so<00:07:39.630> I

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:39.690 
journey I sleep on my left side so I

00:07:39.690 --> 00:07:40.910 
journey I sleep on my left side so I
think<00:07:39.780> that<00:07:39.990> that<00:07:40.170> has<00:07:40.200> something<00:07:40.620> to<00:07:40.680> do<00:07:40.800> with

00:07:40.910 --> 00:07:40.920 
think that that has something to do with

00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:42.710 
think that that has something to do with

00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:48.240 
far as the nape area that was my

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:50.900 
far as the nape area that was my
shortest<00:07:48.600> session<00:07:49.560> it<00:07:49.860> was<00:07:49.950> like<00:07:50.130> seven<00:07:50.700> and<00:07:50.850> a

00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:50.910 
shortest session it was like seven and a

00:07:50.910 --> 00:07:53.210 
shortest session it was like seven and a
quarter<00:07:51.120> inches<00:07:51.270> long<00:07:51.750> whereas<00:07:52.470> the<00:07:52.770> two<00:07:52.980> bad

00:07:53.210 --> 00:07:53.220 
quarter inches long whereas the two bad

00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:55.730 
quarter inches long whereas the two bad
sides<00:07:53.580> were<00:07:54.420> about<00:07:55.110> eight<00:07:55.290> and<00:07:55.320> a<00:07:55.440> half<00:07:55.470> inches

00:07:55.730 --> 00:07:55.740

00:07:55.740 --> 00:07:58.340 
sides were about eight and a half inches
long<00:07:55.980> so<00:07:56.250> i<00:07:56.490> do<00:07:56.820> have<00:07:57.030> places<00:07:57.870> in<00:07:58.080> my<00:07:58.170> hair<00:07:58.320> that

00:07:58.340 --> 00:07:58.350 
long so i do have places in my hair that

00:07:58.350 --> 00:08:00.590 
long so i do have places in my hair that
