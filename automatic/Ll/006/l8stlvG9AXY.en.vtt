pathway we have a reward pathway because
we<00:02:40.110> need<00:02:40.319> to<00:02:40.440> feel<00:02:40.650> good<00:02:40.830> about<00:02:41.010> doing<00:02:41.430> things

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:39.890 
an apple
I<00:03:38.489> understand<00:03:38.970> it's<00:03:39.090> an<00:03:39.180> apple<00:03:39.450> and<00:03:39.570> I<00:03:39.630> want<00:03:39.810> to

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
I understand it's an apple and I want to

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:41.840 
I understand it's an apple and I want to
eat<00:03:40.049> apple<00:03:40.500> and<00:03:40.680> when<00:03:40.769> I<00:03:40.799> eat<00:03:41.040> an<00:03:41.160> apple<00:03:41.280> it

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:41.850 
eat apple and when I eat an apple it

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:44.990 
eat apple and when I eat an apple it
feels<00:03:42.150> good<00:03:42.420> so<00:03:43.350> that<00:03:43.590> system<00:03:44.100> is<00:03:44.340> the<00:03:44.549> very

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
feels good so that system is the very

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.240 
feels good so that system is the very
system<00:03:45.450> that<00:03:45.480> opiates<00:03:46.079> can<00:03:46.290> then<00:03:46.530> work<00:03:46.769> on<00:03:46.980> and

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
system that opiates can then work on and

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:49.580 
system that opiates can then work on and
they<00:03:47.700> actually<00:03:48.019> stimulate<00:03:49.019> those<00:03:49.200> same

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590 
they actually stimulate those same

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:51.949 
they actually stimulate those same
receptor<00:03:50.130> proteins<00:03:50.609> but<00:03:51.299> when<00:03:51.450> they<00:03:51.570> do<00:03:51.630> so

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 
receptor proteins but when they do so

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:54.199 
receptor proteins but when they do so
they<00:03:51.989> overwhelm<00:03:52.680> it<00:03:52.829> and<00:03:53.100> so<00:03:53.730> you're<00:03:54.030> actually

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:54.209 
they overwhelm it and so you're actually

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:56.840 
they overwhelm it and so you're actually
activating<00:03:55.170> and<00:03:55.350> hijacking<00:03:55.950> then<00:03:56.370> a<00:03:56.519> natural

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:56.850 
activating and hijacking then a natural

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:59.360 
activating and hijacking then a natural
reward<00:03:57.540> system<00:03:58.049> when<00:03:58.709> you're<00:03:58.829> using<00:03:59.040> drugs

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 
reward system when you're using drugs

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:01.490

during the teen years kids brains are

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:41.050 
during the teen years kids brains are
hard-wired<00:04:38.390> to<00:04:38.840> begin<00:04:39.410> taking<00:04:39.710> risks<00:04:40.310> that

risk taking can lead to experimentation

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:46.240 
risk taking can lead to experimentation
which<00:04:43.700> in<00:04:43.910> turn<00:04:44.150> can<00:04:44.450> lead<00:04:44.510> to<00:04:44.840> addiction<00:04:45.250> bill

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:46.250 
which in turn can lead to addiction bill

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:48.430 
which in turn can lead to addiction bill
like<00:04:46.820> a<00:04:46.850> lot<00:04:47.090> of<00:04:47.120> teens<00:04:47.480> thought<00:04:48.110> he<00:04:48.260> had

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:48.440 
like a lot of teens thought he had

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:50.110 
like a lot of teens thought he had
everything<00:04:48.890> under<00:04:49.400> control

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:50.120 
everything under control

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:53.470 
everything under control
until<00:04:50.870> he<00:04:51.350> didn't<00:04:51.680> yeah<00:04:52.400> I<00:04:52.670> was<00:04:53.030> the<00:04:53.210> smart

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:53.480 
until he didn't yeah I was the smart

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:55.720 
until he didn't yeah I was the smart
drug<00:04:53.660> addict<00:04:53.960> I<00:04:54.170> was<00:04:54.500> the<00:04:54.650> one<00:04:54.800> I<00:04:55.100> wasn't<00:04:55.580> gonna

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:55.730 
drug addict I was the one I wasn't gonna

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:57.910 
drug addict I was the one I wasn't gonna
be<00:04:55.940> like<00:04:56.120> the<00:04:56.240> other<00:04:56.360> ones<00:04:56.630> I<00:04:56.900> was<00:04:57.320> first<00:04:57.770> of

00:04:57.910 --> 00:04:57.920 
be like the other ones I was first of

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:59.200 
be like the other ones I was first of
all<00:04:57.980> I<00:04:58.040> wasn't<00:04:58.220> gonna<00:04:58.370> get<00:04:58.520> addicted<00:04:58.940> because

00:04:59.200 --> 00:04:59.210 
all I wasn't gonna get addicted because

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:01.120 
all I wasn't gonna get addicted because
I<00:04:59.390> knew<00:04:59.720> what<00:04:59.960> addiction<00:05:00.320> was<00:05:00.470> and<00:05:00.680> I<00:05:00.710> knew<00:05:00.950> how

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:01.130 
I knew what addiction was and I knew how

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:03.970 
I knew what addiction was and I knew how
it<00:05:01.160> work<00:05:01.460> and<00:05:01.640> so<00:05:02.120> I<00:05:02.390> had<00:05:03.350> a<00:05:03.380> system<00:05:03.830> in<00:05:03.950> place

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:03.980 
it work and so I had a system in place

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:06.310 
it work and so I had a system in place
to<00:05:04.700> stop<00:05:04.970> myself<00:05:05.150> from<00:05:05.450> becoming<00:05:06.020> addicted

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:06.320 
to stop myself from becoming addicted

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:09.010 
to stop myself from becoming addicted
and<00:05:06.650> I<00:05:06.740> was<00:05:06.920> smart<00:05:07.190> enough<00:05:07.280> to<00:05:07.430> do<00:05:07.640> that<00:05:07.900> and<00:05:08.900> I

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:09.020 
and I was smart enough to do that and I

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:11.409 
and I was smart enough to do that and I
was<00:05:09.140> also<00:05:09.290> smart<00:05:09.740> enough<00:05:09.890> to<00:05:10.180> convince<00:05:11.180> myself

00:05:11.409 --> 00:05:11.419 
was also smart enough to convince myself

00:05:11.419 --> 00:05:15.040 
was also smart enough to convince myself
that<00:05:11.870> it<00:05:12.020> was<00:05:12.230> working<00:05:12.620> and<00:05:13.010> it<00:05:13.130> wasn't<00:05:14.020> and<00:05:15.020> so

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:15.050 
that it was working and it wasn't and so

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:16.930 
that it was working and it wasn't and so
yeah<00:05:15.650> I<00:05:15.680> just<00:05:15.919> thought<00:05:16.220> I<00:05:16.400> was<00:05:16.610> the<00:05:16.760> special

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:16.940 
yeah I just thought I was the special

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:19.960 
yeah I just thought I was the special
one<00:05:17.120> I<00:05:17.450> thought<00:05:18.410> everything<00:05:18.740> that<00:05:19.160> everybody

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:19.970 
one I thought everything that everybody

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:21.700 
one I thought everything that everybody
thinks<00:05:20.260> everyone<00:05:21.260> thinks<00:05:21.470> that<00:05:21.500> they're

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:21.710 
thinks everyone thinks that they're

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:24.610 
thinks everyone thinks that they're
special<00:05:22.100> but<00:05:22.610> in<00:05:22.760> the<00:05:22.910> end<00:05:23.090> they<00:05:23.630> all<00:05:24.020> do<00:05:24.470> the

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:24.620 
special but in the end they all do the

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:26.350 
special but in the end they all do the

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:28.460 
exact same thing and I sometimes I just

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:29.950 
exact same thing and I sometimes I just
want<00:05:28.850> to<00:05:28.940> shake<00:05:29.240> some<00:05:29.419> people<00:05:29.660> and<00:05:29.780> say<00:05:29.930> you

know you're not the first one to say
that<00:05:32.330> or<00:05:32.720> think<00:05:32.930> that<00:05:33.130> bill<00:05:34.130> was<00:05:34.340> starting<00:05:34.730> to

withdrawal<00:05:39.380> when<00:05:39.830> the<00:05:39.919> drug<00:05:40.130> is<00:05:40.160> removed<00:05:40.610> the

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:41.240 
withdrawal when the drug is removed the

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:42.490 
withdrawal when the drug is removed the
other<00:05:41.330> thing<00:05:41.540> that<00:05:41.570> happens<00:05:42.050> with<00:05:42.229> the<00:05:42.260> brain

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:42.500 
other thing that happens with the brain

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:44.320 
other thing that happens with the brain
when<00:05:42.919> you<00:05:43.040> take<00:05:43.280> heroin<00:05:43.550> over<00:05:43.910> and<00:05:44.030> over<00:05:44.210> again

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:44.330 
when you take heroin over and over again

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:46.990 
when you take heroin over and over again
is<00:05:44.750> that<00:05:45.229> you<00:05:45.620> start<00:05:45.890> to<00:05:45.979> become<00:05:46.100> dependent<00:05:46.610> on

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:47.000 
is that you start to become dependent on

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.030 
is that you start to become dependent on
the<00:05:47.390> drug<00:05:47.419> and<00:05:47.930> that's<00:05:48.110> because<00:05:48.440> again<00:05:48.590> your

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:49.040 
the drug and that's because again your

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:51.040 
the drug and that's because again your
brain<00:05:49.280> is<00:05:49.520> trying<00:05:49.790> to<00:05:50.030> compensate<00:05:50.479> for<00:05:50.930> all

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:51.050 
brain is trying to compensate for all

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:54.040 
brain is trying to compensate for all
this<00:05:51.320> drug<00:05:51.680> and<00:05:51.979> by<00:05:52.760> compensating<00:05:53.390> what<00:05:53.900> that

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:54.050 
this drug and by compensating what that

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:55.659 
this drug and by compensating what that
means<00:05:54.320> is<00:05:54.590> is<00:05:54.770> that<00:05:54.800> you<00:05:55.040> now<00:05:55.250> become

00:05:55.659 --> 00:05:55.669 
means is is that you now become

00:05:55.669 --> 00:05:57.880 
means is is that you now become
dependent<00:05:56.000> on<00:05:56.240> that<00:05:56.390> drug<00:05:56.690> being<00:05:57.080> present<00:05:57.710> for

00:05:57.880 --> 00:05:57.890 
dependent on that drug being present for

00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:00.190 
dependent on that drug being present for
you<00:05:58.400> to<00:05:58.520> even<00:05:58.700> feel<00:05:59.030> normal<00:05:59.360> and<00:05:59.900> when<00:06:00.110> the

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:00.200 
you to even feel normal and when the

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:02.680 
you to even feel normal and when the
drug<00:06:00.470> goes<00:06:00.650> away<00:06:00.950> you<00:06:01.220> no<00:06:01.700> longer<00:06:01.910> feel<00:06:02.210> normal

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:02.690 
drug goes away you no longer feel normal

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:04.750 
drug goes away you no longer feel normal
what<00:06:03.380> can<00:06:03.560> make<00:06:03.740> this<00:06:03.890> cycle<00:06:04.280> abuse<00:06:04.580> and

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:04.760 
what can make this cycle abuse and

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:07.030 
what can make this cycle abuse and
dependence<00:06:05.000> so<00:06:05.479> dangerous<00:06:06.020> if<00:06:06.800> you're

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:07.040 
dependence so dangerous if you're

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:09.370 
dependence so dangerous if you're
seeking<00:06:07.460> out<00:06:07.610> to<00:06:07.850> get<00:06:08.000> that<00:06:08.180> high<00:06:08.390> again<00:06:08.750> you

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:09.380 
seeking out to get that high again you

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:12.100 
seeking out to get that high again you
often<00:06:09.770> have<00:06:09.919> to<00:06:09.950> increase<00:06:10.490> the<00:06:10.760> dose<00:06:10.940> and<00:06:11.330> the

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:12.110 
often have to increase the dose and the

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:14.140 
often have to increase the dose and the
more<00:06:12.410> you<00:06:12.560> take<00:06:12.770> the<00:06:12.950> drug<00:06:13.190> the<00:06:13.490> more<00:06:13.669> tolerant

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:14.150 
more you take the drug the more tolerant

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:16.719 
more you take the drug the more tolerant
you<00:06:14.210> may<00:06:14.419> become<00:06:14.870> and<00:06:15.110> the<00:06:15.560> larger<00:06:15.950> dose<00:06:16.190> you

00:06:16.719 --> 00:06:16.729 
you may become and the larger dose you

00:06:16.729 --> 00:06:19.420 
you may become and the larger dose you
must<00:06:17.000> get<00:06:17.300> to<00:06:17.540> get<00:06:17.690> the<00:06:17.870> same<00:06:18.110> high<00:06:18.440> so<00:06:19.400> that

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:19.430 
must get to get the same high so that

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:21.550 
must get to get the same high so that
means<00:06:19.790> that<00:06:19.940> we<00:06:20.030> get<00:06:20.120> really<00:06:20.360> worried<00:06:20.900> that

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:21.560 
means that we get really worried that

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:24.730 
means that we get really worried that
the<00:06:22.010> potential<00:06:22.580> for<00:06:22.760> overdosing<00:06:23.740> increases

00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:24.740 
the potential for overdosing increases

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:26.700 
the potential for overdosing increases
as<00:06:24.919> you're<00:06:25.340> increasing<00:06:26.120> the<00:06:26.240> amount<00:06:26.510> of
