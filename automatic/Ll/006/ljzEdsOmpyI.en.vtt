00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:07.310
 welcome to this new video in which 

00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:09.590
 I want to teach you how to have software 

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:12.379
 which contains practically all types of 

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:13.249
 consoles to be able to emulate those of 

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:15.289
 agreement 

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:17.180
 the software is called emulator is 

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:19.220
 totally free and the official website 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:21.619
 will be in the description of the video for 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:23.480
 that you can go more easily said 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:24.859
 this we go to the official page as has 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:26.150
 commented will be the description of 

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:28.310
 video so you can follow a 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:30.050
 quite easy way and nothing to whom 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:31.939
 then what are the different 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:33.260
 functions that the software has since it 

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:35.660
 you can read it on the official website 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:37.610
 obviously we are going to download the 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:39.920
 last version that that emulator its 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:41.390
 version 5 and we simply click 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.879
 here and it would download 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:45.890
 well he would send us this to his page in 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:48.500
 which we are going to download the 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:50.870
 offline version is worth then we do 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:53.140
 click here 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:56.120
 and here we are going to wait a few moments 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:58.760
 because we have to wait for the 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:01.579
 typical seconds to download it 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:03.680
 and we give you in download once done 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:06.950
 this then begins to download what 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:09.380
 is the installer weighs about 33 mega weighs 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:11.360
 very little truth and nothing once already 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.820
 has finished we click on it to 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:16.700
 start what is the installation of the 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:18.050
 software ok let's minimize here 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.360
 so that it does not bother in fact we're going to 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:22.310
 close the window there we have it 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.960
 We give in following to continue with the 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.970
 installation we select the folder of 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.530
 where we want to install it in 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:29.390
 this case you already know that I like it 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.240
 have everything pretty always placed 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:33.790
 I say it but good 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:36.030
 I think that is how you have to do 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:38.340
 things do not have it 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.049
 the software where the software and everything 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.119
 this must be kept in place 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.890
 so we do not lose you then we create 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:47.480
 We will call you a new folder 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:51.020
 how is software called in mulatos 

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:51.020
 capitalized 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.399
 there we have it great we select it and 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:59.130
 select the folder we give you in the 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:01.180
 next weighs pretty little the truth and 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:04.390
 install vale 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:06.700
 will not obviously ask for what 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:08.710
 let's be an administrator and nothing 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:10.060
 installation process may last 

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:12.430
 more or less depending on your 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:14.500
 machine too so I served that 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:15.880
 takes a long time to cause it and I think that 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:19.040
 is going pretty fast so do not 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:21.079
 I think you need to pause the video 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:25.189
 and well let's wait a few moments 

00:02:21.079 --> 00:02:30.579
 but pause the video to continue 

00:02:25.189 --> 00:02:30.579
 when finished the installation of agreement 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:37.000
 let's go over 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:39.790
 Well the installation has finished 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.580
 lasted about two minutes out there and nothing 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:44.530
 just now we close here and as 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:46.690
 you see the icon has not been created in the 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:49.630
 desk let's double click on 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:51.430
 him to run what is the software and 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:53.470
 Now let's see a little bit what it is 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:55.870
 the interface so you know how 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:58.570
 move a little bit over here 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:01.300
 how do you see we have the list of emulators 

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:06.520
 that we have at our disposal play 1 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:10.090
 play 2 psp wii ds nintendo 64 the gta 

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:11.920
 megadrive good different consoles is 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:13.870
 to see that they introduce the new 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:15.850
 good xbox consoles the new one is the 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:20.080
 previous generation to which we are the 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:22.300
 360 teams 360 and ps3 so we're going to 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:26.250
 wait a couple of months that sure 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:28.480
 soon we will have them here not good 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:30.430
 different quick actions that we have 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:33.640
 down here backups the truth 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:35.740
 that I do not use any of this the menu is worth 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:38.410
 simply because in different 

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:41.380
 configurations that we have the version 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:42.580
 but in which it has different advantages 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:45.030
 but I think with the version 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:46.980
 free since we work quite well 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:49.170
 configuration 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:51.930
 let's see if you do not open it if it would not be 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:53.879
 of it is here and not open as 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:55.909
 you see we have the Spanish language is 

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:59.610
 everything in Spanish pretty well we have 

00:03:55.909 --> 00:04:01.980
 live emulators is disabled this 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:03.540
 it is simply a function that checks 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:05.370
 to install the latest version 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:08.250
 that is to say 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:10.530
 that if the software is activated 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:13.069
 the times' emulator is some 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:16.139
 update that have been taking the 

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:16.949
 developers of this program because it 

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:18.750
 will update us automatically 

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:22.049
 then we will have the backup copies 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:23.610
 as I said before and then the option 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:25.350
 to reset the configuration 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:29.250
 default 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:31.169
 we are going to close and we are going here to go to 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:34.169
 emulators as you see we have different 

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:38.010
 types of emulators and let's go go 

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:40.080
 Well, we have the oldest consoles and 

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:43.560
 here we would have the ones that are more 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:47.150
 current as you see we have nintendo ds 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:49.620
 the psp the uy ok we have enough 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:52.289
 consoles then what are we going to do 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:53.650
 now it will be give you to download one by 

00:04:52.289 --> 00:04:57.130
 example 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:59.050
 the PSP portable playstation and then 

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:00.940
 we give here to download as you see it 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:04.000
 does it in a fairly simple way and 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:06.669
 quite functional does not have any 

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:09.090
 lost here as you see we have the 

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:11.470
 options to create backup copies and 

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:12.850
 you can import some copy of 

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:15.490
 security of some data that we 

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:16.479
 let's have perfect vale as you see already 

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:20.320
 we have 

00:05:16.479 --> 00:05:22.870
 well here what is downloaded and to the 

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:24.490
 portable playstation emulator and for 

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:26.710
 start then simple we would not give it here 

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:28.539
 to start and automatically then it 

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:31.120
 starts what is the emulator of the 

00:05:28.539 --> 00:05:32.949
 portable playstation then now what 

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:34.830
 what we are going to do is load what 

00:05:32.949 --> 00:05:37.570
 it's an iso to be able to play a game 

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:40.600
 I have downloaded the story in 

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:45.370
 this case is a made of a psp game 

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:46.570
 it's marvel is a lot of marvel and nothing 

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:48.639
 simply what we are going to do is 

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:50.639
 give it here in charge of agreement and here 

00:05:48.639 --> 00:05:52.900
 we would have it, this would be the iso 

00:05:50.639 --> 00:05:55.590
 remember that it is at iso point and you 

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:55.590
 we would give in 

00:05:55.980 --> 00:06:00.750
 and ok here we would have the game for 

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:02.780
 play and others I will not play but good 

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:06.060
 there we have it and you could play 

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:08.220
 automatically to the game so nothing 

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:11.580
 people like you see pretty simple me 

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:13.770
 I think it's an all-in-one emulator like that 

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:16.950
