00:00:14.649 --> 00:00:18.970
 every Tuesday two years goes on 40 during the first quarter with lyon 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:21.970
 we learned to swim 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:25.970
 we enter the water 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:28.970
 imitating the little artillery train 

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:33.079
 jumping 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:48.060
 it was about learning to immerse oneself 

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:50.040
 to control breathing 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:51.310
 to move 

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:54.310
 and to swim more or less well control and back 

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:01.360
 we even thought 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:04.000
 we swam the magnets on the members distance 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
 difference stone 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.190
 we know floor 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:43.330
 go to eat underwater 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:45.070
 avoid obstacles 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:47.150
 facetious or without carpets 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:50.480
 and dialectics with boards 

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:51.920
 who says to swim alone 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.920
 and find out how do they find an agent who 

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:18.279
 next appointment reproached m 8 because no doubt that we are from 

00:02:18.279 --> 00:02:18.959
 true champion champions
