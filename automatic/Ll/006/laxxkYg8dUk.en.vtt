set the only one less now to show is the

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:24.470 
set the only one less now to show is the
slide<00:05:21.510> so<00:05:22.500> to<00:05:23.040> use<00:05:23.430> the<00:05:23.670> slide<00:05:23.940> all<00:05:24.240> you<00:05:24.360> need

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:30.240 
will move round into position so you can

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:32.660 
will move round into position so you can
take<00:05:30.480> your<00:05:30.510> figure<00:05:31.140> and<00:05:31.320> drop<00:05:31.950> it<00:05:32.130> down<00:05:32.160> the

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:34.800 
slide and you'll figure well slide it

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:36.950 
slide and you'll figure well slide it
down<00:05:35.100> there<00:05:35.370> works<00:05:35.610> better<00:05:35.880> if<00:05:36.150> it<00:05:36.300> is<00:05:36.450> open

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:36.960 
down there works better if it is open

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:39.500 
down there works better if it is open
because<00:05:37.470> you<00:05:37.800> get<00:05:38.010> an<00:05:38.220> open<00:05:38.730> end<00:05:39.030> at<00:05:39.300> the

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:39.510 
because you get an open end at the

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:41.780 
because you get an open end at the
bottom<00:05:39.870> so<00:05:40.140> let's<00:05:40.740> put<00:05:40.920> Mickey<00:05:41.250> on<00:05:41.430> the<00:05:41.550> slide

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:41.790 
bottom so let's put Mickey on the slide

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:44.690 
bottom so let's put Mickey on the slide
again<00:05:42.050> and<00:05:43.050> there<00:05:43.350> you<00:05:43.440> can<00:05:43.620> see<00:05:43.830> Mickey<00:05:44.250> is
