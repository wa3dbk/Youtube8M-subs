now the mistake I see a lot of people
make<00:00:31.679> is<00:00:32.510> they'll<00:00:33.510> take<00:00:33.780> a<00:00:34.079> piece<00:00:35.070> of

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
make is they'll take a piece of

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.920 
make is they'll take a piece of
sandpaper<00:00:35.610> and<00:00:35.969> they'll<00:00:36.180> hold<00:00:36.450> it<00:00:36.630> in<00:00:36.750> their

sandpaper and they'll hold it in their
hand<00:00:38.090> and<00:00:39.090> do<00:00:40.020> this<00:00:40.640> that's

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
hand and do this that's

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.110 
hand and do this that's
counterproductive<00:00:43.129> because<00:00:44.129> any<00:00:44.670> time

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
following the curve in the middle it'll

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.939 
following the curve in the middle it'll
never<00:00:52.500> be<00:00:52.649> flat<00:00:53.210> if<00:00:54.210> you<00:00:54.480> use<00:00:54.660> a<00:00:55.050> sanding<00:00:55.620> stick

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
it back one way you turn it 90 degrees

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.230 
it back one way you turn it 90 degrees
and<00:01:18.150> you<00:01:18.570> sand<00:01:19.530> it<00:01:19.710> again<00:01:19.830> and<00:01:20.340> this<00:01:21.030> will

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
and you sand it again and this will

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.539 
and you sand it again and this will
actually<00:01:21.810> show<00:01:22.110> you<00:01:22.140> whether<00:01:22.590> there<00:01:23.040> any<00:01:23.220> high

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
spots or not but this is the only way to

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.850 
spots or not but this is the only way to
take<00:01:26.729> the<00:01:26.909> high<00:01:27.090> spots<00:01:27.570> out<00:01:27.990> of<00:01:28.049> a<00:01:28.439> piece<00:01:28.650> of

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
take the high spots out of a piece of

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.910 
take the high spots out of a piece of
material<00:01:29.040> and<00:01:29.520> to<00:01:29.700> make<00:01:29.850> it<00:01:30.030> perfectly<00:01:30.450> flat

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:30.920 
material and to make it perfectly flat

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.830 
material and to make it perfectly flat
so<00:01:31.920> that<00:01:32.159> when<00:01:32.340> you<00:01:32.490> polish<00:01:32.759> it<00:01:32.939> it'll<00:01:33.570> have<00:01:33.810> a

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
so that when you polish it it'll have a

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.039 
so that when you polish it it'll have a
mirror<00:01:34.290> finish<00:01:35.180> if<00:01:36.180> you<00:01:36.240> don't<00:01:36.600> use<00:01:36.810> one<00:01:37.020> of

mirror finish if you don't use one of

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.960 
mirror finish if you don't use one of
these<00:01:37.229> and<00:01:37.710> use<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:38.130> sandpaper<00:01:38.520> on<00:01:38.729> your

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
these and use the sandpaper on your

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.780 
these and use the sandpaper on your
fingers<00:01:39.380> it<00:01:40.380> will<00:01:40.680> always<00:01:40.890> have<00:01:41.250> a<00:01:41.280> ripple

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
that I use I use a number to cut burette

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:46.770 
that I use I use a number to cut burette
file<00:02:44.530> mm<00:02:45.100> that's<00:02:45.790> because<00:02:46.120> it<00:02:46.240> has<00:02:46.390> a<00:02:46.420> thin

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
file mm that's because it has a thin

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:48.750 
file mm that's because it has a thin
edge<00:02:46.990> and<00:02:47.260> it'll<00:02:47.410> let<00:02:47.500> me<00:02:47.680> get<00:02:47.890> in<00:02:48.040> close<00:02:48.370> to

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
edge and it'll let me get in close to

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:53.760 
edge and it'll let me get in close to
areas<00:02:49.480> and<00:02:50.310> a<00:02:51.310> number<00:02:51.700> to<00:02:52.030> cut<00:02:52.360> round<00:02:53.020> and<00:02:53.440> and

areas and a number to cut round and and

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:56.820 
areas and a number to cut round and and
those<00:02:54.190> are<00:02:54.400> basically<00:02:54.810> the<00:02:55.810> cleanup<00:02:56.110> tools<00:02:56.590> I

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:56.830 
those are basically the cleanup tools I

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:06.110 
those are basically the cleanup tools I
use<00:02:57.540> I<00:02:58.540> do<00:02:59.380> use<00:03:00.270> the<00:03:01.270> medium<00:03:01.720> grit<00:03:03.900> disks

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:04.830 
micro motor or a pendant drill in this
case<00:04:03.100> I've<00:04:03.519> got<00:04:03.580> a<00:04:04.030> what<00:04:04.540> they<00:04:04.660> call<00:04:04.690> a

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:04.840 
case I've got a what they call a

cylinder burr or a parallel berth
I'll<00:04:08.350> zoom<00:04:08.650> in<00:04:09.930> now<00:04:10.930> when<00:04:11.470> you're<00:04:11.650> when<00:04:12.010> you're

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:12.040 
I'll zoom in now when you're when you're

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:15.150 
I'll zoom in now when you're when you're
using<00:04:12.489> something<00:04:12.700> like<00:04:13.120> this<00:04:13.709> it's<00:04:14.709> quite

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:15.160 
using something like this it's quite

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:17.640 
using something like this it's quite
aggressive<00:04:15.880> and<00:04:16.150> if<00:04:16.780> you're<00:04:17.019> just<00:04:17.049> if<00:04:17.500> you

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:17.650 
aggressive and if you're just if you

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:21.150 
aggressive and if you're just if you
spin<00:04:18.609> this<00:04:18.789> up<00:04:19.060> it'll<00:04:19.510> always<00:04:19.870> try<00:04:20.080> to<00:04:20.160> jump

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:21.160 
spin this up it'll always try to jump

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:21.949 
spin this up it'll always try to jump
around<00:04:21.310> the

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:21.959 
around the

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:24.290 
around the
and<00:04:22.199> they'll<00:04:22.860> usually<00:04:23.370> make<00:04:23.580> more<00:04:24.000> of<00:04:24.150> a<00:04:24.270> mess

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:24.300 
and they'll usually make more of a mess

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:27.740 
and they'll usually make more of a mess
than<00:04:25.110> not<00:04:25.380> so<00:04:26.250> what<00:04:26.400> you<00:04:26.550> do<00:04:26.729> is<00:04:26.850> if<00:04:27.060> you<00:04:27.479> brace

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:27.750 
than not so what you do is if you brace

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:29.450 
than not so what you do is if you brace
your<00:04:28.020> hands<00:04:28.380> tightly<00:04:28.680> together

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:29.460 
your hands tightly together

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:38.250 
I always brace one hand against the

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:41.629 
I always brace one hand against the
other<00:04:38.430> so<00:04:38.789> that<00:04:38.940> I'm<00:04:39.150> in<00:04:39.180> control<00:04:39.860> and<00:04:40.860> if<00:04:41.400> you

other so that I'm in control and if you
do<00:04:41.880> that<00:04:44.000> you<00:04:45.000> can<00:04:45.180> quite<00:04:45.539> easily<00:04:45.570> make<00:04:46.440> sure

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:46.770 
do that you can quite easily make sure

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:49.909 
do that you can quite easily make sure
that<00:04:47.570> this<00:04:48.570> doesn't<00:04:48.900> jump<00:04:49.320> around<00:04:49.500> to<00:04:49.800> where

00:04:49.909 --> 00:04:49.919 
that this doesn't jump around to where

that this doesn't jump around to where
you<00:04:50.009> don't<00:04:50.220> want<00:04:50.520> it<00:04:54.800> now<00:04:55.800> the<00:04:55.860> way<00:04:56.070> this<00:04:56.280> turns

00:04:56.659 --> 00:04:56.669 
you don't want it now the way this turns

00:04:56.669 --> 00:05:02.990 
you don't want it now the way this turns
it<00:04:57.090> will<00:04:57.270> always<00:04:57.840> try<00:04:58.680> to<00:04:58.710> jump<00:04:59.400> forward<00:05:02.000> brace

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:03.000 
it will always try to jump forward brace

it will always try to jump forward brace
your<00:05:03.240> hands<00:05:03.539> together<00:05:03.690> now<00:05:03.930> it<00:05:04.500> doesn't
