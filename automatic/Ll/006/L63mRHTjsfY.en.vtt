progress<00:01:09.630> videos<00:01:09.960> and<00:01:10.350> random<00:01:10.860> scaling<00:01:11.220> blogs

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
progress videos and random scaling blogs

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.930 
progress videos and random scaling blogs
but<00:01:14.080> yeah<00:01:14.380> guys<00:01:14.590> this<00:01:14.830> is<00:01:15.040> my<00:01:15.220> first<00:01:15.490> video<00:01:15.790> in

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:15.940 
but yeah guys this is my first video in

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:18.180 
but yeah guys this is my first video in
the<00:01:16.330> one-hour<00:01:16.660> time<00:01:16.990> lapse<00:01:17.260> series<00:01:17.650> as<00:01:17.980> you

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:18.190 
the one-hour time lapse series as you

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:21.120 
the one-hour time lapse series as you
can<00:01:18.340> see<00:01:18.550> i<00:01:18.820> did<00:01:19.450> a<00:01:19.480> one-hour<00:01:20.440> time<00:01:20.680> lapse<00:01:20.980> of

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:21.130 
can see i did a one-hour time lapse of

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:23.630 
can see i did a one-hour time lapse of
me<00:01:21.340> mining<00:01:21.730> golden<00:01:22.210> Living<00:01:22.570> Rock<00:01:22.600> caverns<00:01:23.170> and

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
me mining golden Living Rock caverns and

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.220 
me mining golden Living Rock caverns and
I<00:01:24.640> pretty<00:01:24.850> much<00:01:25.000> did<00:01:25.300> this<00:01:25.450> because<00:01:25.810> there's<00:01:26.170> a

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:26.230 
I pretty much did this because there's a

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:28.350 
I pretty much did this because there's a
lot<00:01:26.410> of<00:01:26.440> speculation<00:01:27.250> of<00:01:27.460> what<00:01:27.730> the<00:01:27.850> XP<00:01:28.120> 4

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:28.360 
lot of speculation of what the XP 4

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.060 
lot of speculation of what the XP 4
hours<00:01:28.660> down<00:01:28.960> here<00:01:29.260> especially<00:01:29.860> since<00:01:30.340> um

all<00:02:37.590> right<00:02:37.890> guys<00:02:38.069> one<00:02:38.430> hour<00:02:38.459> of<00:02:38.790> mining<00:02:39.120> is<00:02:39.269> up

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
all right guys one hour of mining is up

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:44.149 
all right guys one hour of mining is up
and<00:02:39.780> i<00:02:40.230> got<00:02:40.439> about<00:02:40.620> 43<00:02:41.579> k<00:02:41.819> XP<00:02:42.299> per<00:02:42.480> hour<00:02:42.749> i<00:02:43.200> guess

00:02:44.149 --> 00:02:44.159 
and i got about 43 k XP per hour i guess

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:45.800 
and i got about 43 k XP per hour i guess
so<00:02:44.189> i<00:02:44.760> probably<00:02:45.239> could<00:02:45.450> have<00:02:45.480> been<00:02:45.629> a<00:02:45.659> little

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
so i probably could have been a little

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:48.140 
so i probably could have been a little
more<00:02:46.109> if<00:02:46.260> i<00:02:46.349> didn't<00:02:46.650> die<00:02:46.769> or<00:02:47.129> had<00:02:47.849> to<00:02:47.969> wait<00:02:48.120> for

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
more if i didn't die or had to wait for

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.690 
more if i didn't die or had to wait for
spawns<00:02:48.569> but<00:02:48.900> oh<00:02:49.109> well<00:02:49.349> anyways<00:02:50.340> I'm<00:02:50.579> gonna

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
spawns but oh well anyways I'm gonna

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.449 
spawns but oh well anyways I'm gonna
bring<00:02:51.659> up<00:02:51.780> a<00:02:51.870> calculator<00:02:52.319> to<00:02:52.590> calculate<00:02:52.799> a<00:02:53.069> GPA

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
bring up a calculator to calculate a GPA

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:59.119 
bring up a calculator to calculate a GPA
per<00:02:53.849> hour<00:02:54.469> alright<00:02:55.469> so<00:02:55.709> we<00:02:55.889> got<00:02:55.920> about<00:02:56.450> 43<00:02:57.450> k<00:02:58.129> xb

00:02:59.119 --> 00:02:59.129 
per hour alright so we got about 43 k xb

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:02.199 
per hour alright so we got about 43 k xb
during<00:02:59.879> the<00:02:59.969> hour<00:03:00.120> time<00:03:00.420> and<00:03:00.750> we<00:03:00.989> r<00:03:01.019> /<00:03:01.409> 65

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:02.209 
during the hour time and we r / 65

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:06.319 
during the hour time and we r / 65
because<00:03:03.209> each<00:03:03.689> gold<00:03:04.079> or<00:03:04.439> 65<00:03:05.069> XP<00:03:05.430> and<00:03:05.669> we<00:03:06.209> get

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:06.329 
because each gold or 65 XP and we get

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:10.699 
because each gold or 65 XP and we get
about<00:03:07.040> 662<00:03:08.040> I'm<00:03:08.489> going<00:03:08.639> to<00:03:08.700> round<00:03:08.879> up<00:03:09.409> 662<00:03:10.409> gold

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
about 662 I'm going to round up 662 gold

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:14.439 
about 662 I'm going to round up 662 gold
ore<00:03:10.889> per<00:03:11.129> hour<00:03:11.480> now<00:03:12.480> multiplying<00:03:13.230> this<00:03:13.560> by

00:03:14.439 --> 00:03:14.449 
ore per hour now multiplying this by

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:16.909 
ore per hour now multiplying this by
first<00:03:15.449> with<00:03:15.659> the<00:03:15.750> price<00:03:15.989> check<00:03:16.260> the<00:03:16.409> gold<00:03:16.650> and

00:03:16.909 --> 00:03:16.919 
first with the price check the gold and

00:03:16.919 --> 00:03:20.570 
first with the price check the gold and
each<00:03:17.519> gold<00:03:17.909> is<00:03:18.209> worth

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:20.580 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:27.420 

354<00:03:21.580> GP<00:03:22.300> /<00:03:22.690> so<00:03:23.020> x<00:03:23.350> is<00:03:23.500> 5<00:03:24.000> 662<00:03:25.000> and<00:03:26.040> now<00:03:27.040> we'll

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.430 
354 GP / so x is 5 662 and now we'll

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:34.260 
354 GP / so x is 5 662 and now we'll
have<00:03:27.670> our<00:03:27.970> JP<00:03:28.960> per<00:03:29.140> hour<00:03:29.320> so<00:03:30.310> this<00:03:30.490> is<00:03:32.070> 234<00:03:33.070> k<00:03:33.370> GP

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:34.270 
have our JP per hour so this is 234 k GP

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:38.880 
have our JP per hour so this is 234 k GP
per<00:03:34.690> hour<00:03:35.310> not<00:03:36.310> bad<00:03:36.690> but<00:03:37.690> yeah<00:03:37.990> guys<00:03:38.200> I<00:03:38.560> hope
