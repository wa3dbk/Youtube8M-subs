00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
pretty nice little head and I'm going to

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.000 
pretty nice little head and I'm going to
take<00:02:45.940> my<00:02:46.150> thread<00:02:46.390> now<00:02:46.720> and<00:02:47.020> advance<00:02:47.410> it<00:02:47.650> over

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
take my thread now and advance it over

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:49.920 
take my thread now and advance it over
the<00:02:48.130> top<00:02:48.340> of<00:02:48.370> that<00:02:48.580> ball<00:02:48.850> back<00:02:49.180> to<00:02:49.480> my<00:02:49.690> main

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
the top of that ball back to my main

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:53.520 
the top of that ball back to my main
tie-in<00:02:50.500> point<00:02:51.210> and<00:02:52.210> from<00:02:52.450> here<00:02:52.840> I'll<00:02:53.320> just

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
tie-in point and from here I'll just

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:56.640 
tie-in point and from here I'll just
take<00:02:53.770> that<00:02:54.000> foam<00:02:55.110> and<00:02:56.110> pull<00:02:56.320> it<00:02:56.410> back<00:02:56.620> over

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
take that foam and pull it back over

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:59.700 
take that foam and pull it back over
itself<00:02:57.310> and<00:02:58.000> tie<00:02:58.600> it<00:02:58.660> down<00:02:58.870> again<00:02:59.260> so<00:02:59.500> you<00:02:59.590> can

00:02:59.700 --> 00:02:59.710 
itself and tie it down again so you can

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:02.850 
itself and tie it down again so you can
see<00:02:59.890> now<00:03:00.130> it's<00:03:00.310> it's<00:03:00.700> created<00:03:01.300> a<00:03:01.530> nice<00:03:02.530> little

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:02.860 
see now it's it's created a nice little

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:04.890 
see now it's it's created a nice little
round<00:03:03.250> head<00:03:03.700> for<00:03:04.000> this<00:03:04.180> and<00:03:04.420> even<00:03:04.690> on<00:03:04.780> the

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:04.900 
round head for this and even on the

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:06.390 
round head for this and even on the
bottom<00:03:05.260> of<00:03:05.350> the<00:03:05.440> hook<00:03:05.620> shank<00:03:05.890> it's<00:03:06.130> just<00:03:06.310> a

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
bottom of the hook shank it's just a

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.570 
bottom of the hook shank it's just a
little<00:03:06.640> slit<00:03:07.710> where<00:03:08.710> its<00:03:08.860> foam<00:03:09.160> you<00:03:09.370> can't

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:09.580 
little slit where its foam you can't

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:12.690 
little slit where its foam you can't
even<00:03:09.700> see<00:03:09.970> the<00:03:10.090> hook<00:03:10.240> shank<00:03:10.450> anymore<00:03:11.580> so<00:03:12.580> at

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:12.700 
even see the hook shank anymore so at

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.200 
even see the hook shank anymore so at
this<00:03:12.820> point<00:03:13.180> I'm<00:03:13.630> going<00:03:13.780> to<00:03:13.840> cut<00:03:14.650> this<00:03:14.920> tag<00:03:15.850> end

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:16.210 
this point I'm going to cut this tag end

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:18.060 
this point I'm going to cut this tag end
of<00:03:16.420> the<00:03:16.510> foam<00:03:16.750> off<00:03:17.020> and<00:03:17.380> the<00:03:17.440> best<00:03:17.560> way<00:03:17.800> to<00:03:17.830> do

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:18.070 
of the foam off and the best way to do

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:20.580 
of the foam off and the best way to do
that<00:03:18.220> is<00:03:18.370> to<00:03:18.520> pull<00:03:18.760> it<00:03:18.880> up<00:03:19.000> tight<00:03:19.330> and<00:03:20.260> push

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
that is to pull it up tight and push

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:22.500 
that is to pull it up tight and push
your<00:03:20.740> your<00:03:21.130> scissors<00:03:21.580> down<00:03:21.790> on<00:03:22.030> the<00:03:22.120> top<00:03:22.360> of

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:22.510 
your your scissors down on the top of

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:25.470 
your your scissors down on the top of
the<00:03:22.570> hook<00:03:22.780> and<00:03:22.810> just<00:03:23.140> trim<00:03:23.530> it<00:03:24.090> so<00:03:25.090> you<00:03:25.180> can<00:03:25.270> see

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 
the hook and just trim it so you can see

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.330 
the hook and just trim it so you can see
what<00:03:25.660> happened<00:03:26.050> there<00:03:26.200> is<00:03:26.290> a<00:03:26.410> trimmed<00:03:27.010> in<00:03:27.190> and

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:27.340 
what happened there is a trimmed in and

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:31.590 
what happened there is a trimmed in and
it<00:03:27.460> sucked<00:03:27.820> down<00:03:28.060> into<00:03:28.360> that<00:03:28.600> little<00:03:28.840> gap<00:03:30.600> now

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:31.600 
it sucked down into that little gap now

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:33.570 
it sucked down into that little gap now
just<00:03:31.870> like<00:03:32.050> the<00:03:32.260> Unsinkable<00:03:32.830> I'm<00:03:33.370> going<00:03:33.520> to

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:33.580 
just like the Unsinkable I'm going to

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:36.120 
just like the Unsinkable I'm going to
add<00:03:33.730> two<00:03:34.090> little<00:03:34.360> eyes<00:03:34.750> to<00:03:35.290> the<00:03:35.410> pattern<00:03:35.890> I

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:36.130 
add two little eyes to the pattern I

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:37.470 
add two little eyes to the pattern I
don't<00:03:36.400> know<00:03:36.520> if<00:03:36.640> this<00:03:36.820> really<00:03:37.120> makes<00:03:37.330> a<00:03:37.450> huge

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:37.480 
don't know if this really makes a huge

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:40.200 
don't know if this really makes a huge
difference<00:03:37.750> but<00:03:38.350> it<00:03:38.500> kind<00:03:38.710> of<00:03:38.830> makes<00:03:39.490> it<00:03:39.700> have

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:40.210 
difference but it kind of makes it have

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:43.410 
difference but it kind of makes it have
a<00:03:40.240> cool<00:03:40.570> effect<00:03:41.100> so<00:03:42.100> I'm<00:03:42.160> going<00:03:42.310> to<00:03:42.370> go<00:03:42.550> cross

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:43.420 
a cool effect so I'm going to go cross

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:47.480 
a cool effect so I'm going to go cross
over<00:03:44.020> the<00:03:44.170> top<00:03:44.470> of<00:03:44.530> this<00:03:45.150> ball<00:03:46.150> of<00:03:46.390> foam<00:03:46.660> and

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:47.490 
over the top of this ball of foam and

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:50.670 
over the top of this ball of foam and
around<00:03:48.490> the<00:03:48.640> hook<00:03:48.790> I<00:03:49.000> and<00:03:49.360> then<00:03:49.480> back<00:03:49.720> over<00:03:50.320> the

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:50.680 
around the hook I and then back over the

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:53.010 
around the hook I and then back over the
opposite<00:03:51.370> way<00:03:51.520> so<00:03:51.550> you<00:03:51.850> basically<00:03:52.240> made<00:03:52.540> an<00:03:52.690> X

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:53.020 
opposite way so you basically made an X

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:55.770 
opposite way so you basically made an X
over<00:03:53.470> the<00:03:53.500> eye<00:03:54.030> it<00:03:55.030> kind<00:03:55.240> of<00:03:55.300> makes<00:03:55.540> it<00:03:55.720> look

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:55.780 
over the eye it kind of makes it look

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:58.460 
over the eye it kind of makes it look
like<00:03:55.990> it's<00:03:56.370> buggy

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:58.470 
like it's buggy

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:03.240 
like it's buggy
okay<00:03:59.470> now<00:03:59.730> this<00:04:00.730> part<00:04:01.150> of<00:04:01.240> the<00:04:01.330> fly<00:04:01.600> is<00:04:02.250> pretty

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:03.250 
okay now this part of the fly is pretty

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:06.090 
okay now this part of the fly is pretty
critical<00:04:04.230> you<00:04:05.230> can<00:04:05.350> see<00:04:05.560> I'm<00:04:05.650> just<00:04:05.680> building

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:06.100 
critical you can see I'm just building

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:09.660 
critical you can see I'm just building
up<00:04:06.460> a<00:04:07.210> gap<00:04:08.200> between<00:04:08.650> the<00:04:09.100> two<00:04:09.130> sections

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:09.670 
up a gap between the two sections

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:12.390 
up a gap between the two sections
between<00:04:10.180> the<00:04:10.480> head<00:04:10.690> and<00:04:10.720> the<00:04:10.900> body<00:04:11.110> and<00:04:11.440> the

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:12.400 
between the head and the body and the

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.490 
between the head and the body and the
reason<00:04:12.730> why<00:04:12.850> it<00:04:12.910> has<00:04:13.150> to<00:04:13.330> be<00:04:13.450> thick<00:04:13.750> is<00:04:13.900> it<00:04:14.080> I'm

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:14.500 
reason why it has to be thick is it I'm

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:16.430 
reason why it has to be thick is it I'm
going<00:04:14.650> to<00:04:14.710> tie<00:04:14.890> some<00:04:15.160> rubber<00:04:15.400> legs<00:04:15.700> into<00:04:16.239> this

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 
going to tie some rubber legs into this

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:21.510 
going to tie some rubber legs into this
if<00:04:17.440> it's<00:04:17.739> not<00:04:18.239> tied<00:04:19.239> in<00:04:19.560> or<00:04:20.560> if<00:04:20.680> it's<00:04:20.830> not<00:04:20.980> wide

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:21.520 
if it's not tied in or if it's not wide

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:24.090 
if it's not tied in or if it's not wide
enough<00:04:21.660> those<00:04:22.660> rubber<00:04:22.990> legs<00:04:23.320> won't<00:04:23.590> stick<00:04:23.890> out

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:24.100 
enough those rubber legs won't stick out

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:26.219 
enough those rubber legs won't stick out
at<00:04:24.250> the<00:04:24.280> proper<00:04:24.760> angles

00:04:26.219 --> 00:04:26.229 
at the proper angles

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:28.899 
at the proper angles
so<00:04:27.229> the<00:04:27.349> legs<00:04:27.560> I'm<00:04:27.830> gonna<00:04:28.009> use<00:04:28.280> on<00:04:28.490> this<00:04:28.639> or

00:04:28.899 --> 00:04:28.909 
so the legs I'm gonna use on this or

00:04:28.909 --> 00:04:31.029 
so the legs I'm gonna use on this or
nothing<00:04:29.180> real<00:04:29.569> fancy<00:04:29.599> just<00:04:30.349> find<00:04:30.740> round

00:04:31.029 --> 00:04:31.039 
nothing real fancy just find round

00:04:31.039 --> 00:04:34.860 
nothing real fancy just find round
rubber<00:04:31.280> legs<00:04:31.610> in<00:04:32.180> black<00:04:32.710> and<00:04:33.710> I'll<00:04:33.830> just<00:04:34.009> take

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:34.870 
rubber legs in black and I'll just take

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:38.320 
rubber legs in black and I'll just take
you<00:04:35.870> know<00:04:35.990> a<00:04:36.020> long<00:04:36.319> piece<00:04:36.650> of<00:04:36.680> leg<00:04:37.099> and<00:04:37.460> tie<00:04:38.030> in

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:38.330 
you know a long piece of leg and tie in

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:42.129 
you know a long piece of leg and tie in
on<00:04:39.080> the<00:04:39.469> side<00:04:39.680> farthest<00:04:40.280> me<00:04:40.460> and<00:04:41.139> it's

00:04:42.129 --> 00:04:42.139 
on the side farthest me and it's

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:44.800

important<00:04:42.919> to<00:04:43.280> make<00:04:43.669> sure<00:04:43.699> that<00:04:44.240> you're<00:04:44.389> tying

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:44.810 
important to make sure that you're tying

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:48.909 
important to make sure that you're tying
in<00:04:46.360> the<00:04:47.360> leg<00:04:47.599> right<00:04:47.990> in<00:04:48.199> the<00:04:48.289> middle<00:04:48.500> of<00:04:48.680> that

00:04:48.909 --> 00:04:48.919 
in the leg right in the middle of that

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:51.459 
in the leg right in the middle of that
band<00:04:49.490> of<00:04:49.789> thread<00:04:50.180> and<00:04:50.479> then<00:04:50.990> I'm<00:04:51.080> just<00:04:51.259> going

00:04:51.459 --> 00:04:51.469 
band of thread and then I'm just going

00:04:51.469 --> 00:04:54.249 
band of thread and then I'm just going
to<00:04:51.620> loop<00:04:51.830> it<00:04:51.979> around<00:04:52.310> and<00:04:52.719> tie<00:04:53.719> it<00:04:53.780> in<00:04:53.990> on<00:04:54.139> the

00:04:54.249 --> 00:04:54.259 
to loop it around and tie it in on the

to loop it around and tie it in on the

00:05:09.459 --> 00:05:09.469 
other side so there I've got my legs

00:05:09.469 --> 00:05:12.939 
other side so there I've got my legs
tied<00:05:09.830> in<00:05:10.039> and<00:05:10.819> then<00:05:11.180> I<00:05:11.270> can<00:05:11.449> trim<00:05:11.810> them<00:05:11.960> I<00:05:12.169> will

00:05:12.939 --> 00:05:12.949 
tied in and then I can trim them I will

00:05:12.949 --> 00:05:16.119 
tied in and then I can trim them I will
trim<00:05:13.310> the<00:05:13.340> back<00:05:13.699> legs<00:05:14.029> roughly<00:05:14.629> a<00:05:14.659> little<00:05:15.229> bit

00:05:16.119 --> 00:05:16.129 
trim the back legs roughly a little bit

00:05:16.129 --> 00:05:25.209 
trim the back legs roughly a little bit
longer<00:05:16.370> than<00:05:16.639> the<00:05:16.699> body<00:05:20.889> like<00:05:21.889> that<00:05:24.009> and<00:05:25.009> then

00:05:25.209 --> 00:05:25.219 
longer than the body like that and then

00:05:25.219 --> 00:05:28.119 
longer than the body like that and then
the<00:05:25.340> front<00:05:25.639> legs<00:05:26.529> typically<00:05:27.529> I'll<00:05:27.650> just<00:05:27.830> push

00:05:28.119 --> 00:05:28.129 
the front legs typically I'll just push

00:05:28.129 --> 00:05:29.950 
the front legs typically I'll just push
those<00:05:28.370> together<00:05:28.610> and<00:05:28.969> trim<00:05:29.240> those<00:05:29.419> both<00:05:29.719> at

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:29.960 
those together and trim those both at

those together and trim those both at
the<00:05:30.050> same<00:05:30.289> time<00:05:30.669> just<00:05:31.669> a<00:05:31.729> little<00:05:31.969> bit<00:05:32.060> longer

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:32.300

than the eye of the hook so like that if
you<00:05:35.360> like<00:05:35.389> I'm<00:05:35.750> shorter<00:05:36.199> that's<00:05:36.440> that's

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:36.860 
you like I'm shorter that's that's

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:39.879 
you like I'm shorter that's that's
completely<00:05:37.370> fine<00:05:37.669> too<00:05:38.560> now<00:05:39.560> I'm<00:05:39.680> going<00:05:39.830> to

00:05:39.879 --> 00:05:39.889 
completely fine too now I'm going to

00:05:39.889 --> 00:05:43.570 
completely fine too now I'm going to
take<00:05:40.069> a<00:05:40.099> piece<00:05:40.550> of<00:05:40.759> one<00:05:41.029> millimeter<00:05:42.129> foam<00:05:43.159> this

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:43.580 
take a piece of one millimeter foam this

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:46.180 
take a piece of one millimeter foam this
is<00:05:43.759> cross-linked<00:05:44.539> foam<00:05:44.810> and<00:05:45.139> just<00:05:45.289> tie<00:05:45.529> cut

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:46.190 
is cross-linked foam and just tie cut

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:50.829 
is cross-linked foam and just tie cut
off<00:05:47.979> about<00:05:48.979> a<00:05:49.039> one<00:05:49.370> millimeter<00:05:49.669> thick<00:05:50.029> piece

00:05:50.829 --> 00:05:50.839 
off about a one millimeter thick piece

00:05:50.839 --> 00:05:57.700 
off about a one millimeter thick piece
of<00:05:51.110> this<00:05:51.229> foam<00:05:55.900> and<00:05:56.900> I<00:05:57.050> will<00:05:57.199> tie<00:05:57.439> that

00:05:57.700 --> 00:05:57.710 
of this foam and I will tie that

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:02.350 
of this foam and I will tie that
indicator<00:05:58.370> off<00:05:59.469> right<00:06:00.469> onto<00:06:00.949> the<00:06:01.039> fly<00:06:01.360> right

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:02.360 
indicator off right onto the fly right

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:05.379 
indicator off right onto the fly right
on<00:06:02.539> top<00:06:02.779> of<00:06:02.960> that<00:06:03.110> band<00:06:03.969> just<00:06:04.969> with<00:06:05.089> a<00:06:05.120> few

00:06:05.379 --> 00:06:05.389 
on top of that band just with a few

00:06:05.389 --> 00:06:11.559 
on top of that band just with a few
wraps<00:06:05.629> of<00:06:05.900> thread<00:06:09.669> and<00:06:10.669> trim<00:06:11.029> it<00:06:11.060> about<00:06:11.389> like

00:06:11.559 --> 00:06:11.569 
wraps of thread and trim it about like

00:06:11.569 --> 00:06:14.469 
wraps of thread and trim it about like
that<00:06:11.629> so<00:06:12.589> that's<00:06:12.710> our<00:06:12.979> indicator<00:06:13.460> now<00:06:14.300> to

00:06:14.469 --> 00:06:14.479 
that so that's our indicator now to

00:06:14.479 --> 00:06:16.420 
that so that's our indicator now to
finish<00:06:14.689> this<00:06:14.960> fly<00:06:15.229> off<00:06:15.439> I<00:06:15.650> could<00:06:15.889> whip<00:06:16.069> finish

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:16.430 
finish this fly off I could whip finish

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:17.980 
finish this fly off I could whip finish
it<00:06:16.550> right<00:06:16.729> here<00:06:17.000> but<00:06:17.150> then<00:06:17.300> I<00:06:17.389> risk<00:06:17.659> catching

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:17.990 
it right here but then I risk catching

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:20.379 
it right here but then I risk catching
those<00:06:18.349> legs<00:06:18.680> so<00:06:18.919> what<00:06:19.039> I'm<00:06:19.129> going<00:06:19.279> to<00:06:19.310> do<00:06:19.490> so

00:06:20.379 --> 00:06:20.389 
those legs so what I'm going to do so

00:06:20.389 --> 00:06:21.820 
those legs so what I'm going to do so
I'm<00:06:20.449> going<00:06:20.599> to<00:06:20.659> pull<00:06:20.839> those<00:06:21.020> front<00:06:21.319> legs<00:06:21.500> back

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:21.830 
I'm going to pull those front legs back

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:26.529 
I'm going to pull those front legs back
take<00:06:22.789> my<00:06:23.029> thread<00:06:23.419> and<00:06:23.810> go<00:06:24.589> over<00:06:25.069> that<00:06:25.389> one<00:06:26.389> of

00:06:26.529 --> 00:06:26.539 
take my thread and go over that one of

00:06:26.539 --> 00:06:28.659 
take my thread and go over that one of
those<00:06:26.629> angled<00:06:27.169> wraps<00:06:27.500> down<00:06:27.919> to<00:06:28.219> the<00:06:28.370> eye<00:06:28.639> of

00:06:28.659 --> 00:06:28.669 
those angled wraps down to the eye of

00:06:28.669 --> 00:06:31.329 
those angled wraps down to the eye of
the<00:06:28.969> hook<00:06:29.120> so<00:06:29.870> now<00:06:30.020> I've<00:06:30.229> got<00:06:30.740> my<00:06:30.770> thread<00:06:31.189> on

00:06:31.329 --> 00:06:31.339 
the hook so now I've got my thread on

00:06:31.339 --> 00:06:34.600 
the hook so now I've got my thread on
the<00:06:31.430> eye<00:06:31.460> and<00:06:32.740> then<00:06:33.740> I'll<00:06:33.860> just<00:06:34.069> whip<00:06:34.279> finish

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:34.610 
the eye and then I'll just whip finish

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:46.650 
the eye and then I'll just whip finish
it

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:46.660 

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:49.660 

and<00:06:47.660> then<00:06:47.840> I'll<00:06:47.930> take<00:06:48.140> some<00:06:48.170> loon<00:06:48.770> water<00:06:49.400> based

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:49.670 
and then I'll take some loon water based

00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:52.690 
and then I'll take some loon water based
cement<00:06:50.180> and<00:06:50.630> I'll<00:06:50.860> barely<00:06:51.860> touch<00:06:52.340> a<00:06:52.370> little

00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:52.700
