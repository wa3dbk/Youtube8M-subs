00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:03.309 
to show you what they look like when

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:07.320 
to show you what they look like when
they<00:01:03.670> start<00:01:04.000> sprouting<00:01:05.189> they<00:01:06.189> start<00:01:06.520> getting

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:07.330 
they start sprouting they start getting

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:09.840 
they start sprouting they start getting
these<00:01:07.479> little<00:01:07.780> tops<00:01:08.080> to<00:01:08.439> them<00:01:08.619> like<00:01:09.549> they're

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:09.850 
these little tops to them like they're

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:13.410 
these little tops to them like they're
they're<00:01:10.390> gonna<00:01:10.509> sprout<00:01:11.170> so<00:01:12.009> there<00:01:12.729> what<00:01:13.180> this

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:13.420 
they're gonna sprout so there what this

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:18.499 
they're gonna sprout so there what this
means<00:01:13.810> is<00:01:14.320> is<00:01:14.860> that<00:01:15.189> they're<00:01:15.580> alive<00:01:16.740> when<00:01:17.740> you

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
means is is that they're alive when you

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.749 
means is is that they're alive when you
just<00:01:19.509> eat<00:01:19.810> almonds<00:01:20.409> raw<00:01:20.710> without<00:01:21.009> sprouting

00:01:21.749 --> 00:01:21.759 
just eat almonds raw without sprouting

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:24.990 
just eat almonds raw without sprouting
them<00:01:21.880> first<00:01:23.159> they're<00:01:24.159> really<00:01:24.310> hard<00:01:24.640> to<00:01:24.729> digest

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:25.000 
them first they're really hard to digest

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.080 
them first they're really hard to digest
because<00:01:25.540> they<00:01:25.960> have<00:01:26.200> on<00:01:26.439> them<00:01:26.680> like<00:01:27.520> an<00:01:27.670> anti

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:28.090 
because they have on them like an anti

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:32.069 
because they have on them like an anti
enzyme<00:01:28.630> so<00:01:29.079> they<00:01:29.380> can<00:01:29.939> stay<00:01:30.939> stable<00:01:31.750> for<00:01:32.020> a

00:01:32.069 --> 00:01:32.079 
enzyme so they can stay stable for a

00:01:32.079 --> 00:01:34.469 
enzyme so they can stay stable for a
long<00:01:32.259> period<00:01:32.619> of<00:01:32.829> time<00:01:32.890> will<00:01:33.610> the<00:01:33.790> minute<00:01:34.240> you

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:34.479 
long period of time will the minute you

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:39.389 
long period of time will the minute you
soak<00:01:35.290> them<00:01:35.649> they'd<00:01:36.399> be<00:01:36.460> so<00:01:36.909> big<00:01:37.540> can't<00:01:38.399> once

00:01:39.389 --> 00:01:39.399 
soak them they'd be so big can't once

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:42.270 
soak them they'd be so big can't once
you<00:01:39.549> soak<00:01:39.880> them<00:01:40.200> they<00:01:41.200> can't<00:01:41.619> go<00:01:41.860> back<00:01:42.070> to

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:42.280 
you soak them they can't go back to

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.429 
you soak them they can't go back to
their<00:01:42.430> dormant<00:01:42.759> state<00:01:43.030> anymore<00:01:43.360> now<00:01:44.170> there's

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:44.439 
their dormant state anymore now there's

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:47.219 
their dormant state anymore now there's
a<00:01:44.500> couple<00:01:44.770> ways<00:01:45.100> to<00:01:45.280> do<00:01:45.640> this<00:01:45.670> so<00:01:46.210> when<00:01:46.960> you<00:01:47.049> eat

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:47.229 
a couple ways to do this so when you eat

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:52.170 
a couple ways to do this so when you eat
them<00:01:47.439> right<00:01:47.680> now<00:01:48.869> they're<00:01:49.869> sweeter<00:01:50.290> and<00:01:51.180> you

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:52.180 
them right now they're sweeter and you

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:56.580 
them right now they're sweeter and you
can<00:01:52.360> just<00:01:52.600> dry<00:01:52.960> these<00:01:53.020> on<00:01:53.829> the<00:01:55.350> counter<00:01:56.350> so

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:56.590 
can just dry these on the counter so

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:01.319 
can just dry these on the counter so
they're<00:01:56.740> just<00:01:56.950> not<00:01:57.130> wet<00:01:57.600> or<00:01:59.909> you<00:02:00.909> can<00:02:01.060> put<00:02:01.210> them

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:01.329 
they're just not wet or you can put them

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:02.789 
they're just not wet or you can put them
in<00:02:01.390> a<00:02:01.420> plastic<00:02:01.600> container<00:02:02.020> or<00:02:02.469> keep<00:02:02.649> them<00:02:02.710> in

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:02.799 
in a plastic container or keep them in

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:04.200 
in a plastic container or keep them in
the<00:02:02.890> refrigerator<00:02:02.920> and<00:02:03.460> they'll<00:02:03.700> last<00:02:03.880> about

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:04.210 
the refrigerator and they'll last about

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:06.420 
the refrigerator and they'll last about
a<00:02:04.270> week<00:02:04.390> but<00:02:05.229> what<00:02:05.380> I'm<00:02:05.590> going<00:02:05.890> to<00:02:05.920> do<00:02:06.130> my

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:06.430 
a week but what I'm going to do my

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:09.859 
a week but what I'm going to do my
favorite<00:02:06.850> way<00:02:07.180> is

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.599 

I'm<00:02:10.869> but<00:02:11.170> I<00:02:11.200> have<00:02:11.590> this<00:02:11.709> little<00:02:11.890> dehydrator

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:12.609 
I'm but I have this little dehydrator

00:02:12.609 --> 00:02:16.339 
I'm but I have this little dehydrator
and<00:02:12.909> I<00:02:13.450> was<00:02:13.540> also<00:02:13.719> thinking<00:02:13.900> about<00:02:14.459> you<00:02:15.459> guys

00:02:16.339 --> 00:02:16.349 
and I was also thinking about you guys

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:22.860 
and I was also thinking about you guys
if<00:02:17.349> you<00:02:17.530> didn't<00:02:17.829> have<00:02:18.010> a<00:02:18.069> dehydrator<00:02:19.650> to<00:02:21.870> put

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
if you didn't have a dehydrator to put

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:25.559 
if you didn't have a dehydrator to put
them<00:02:23.079> on<00:02:23.379> like<00:02:23.859> in<00:02:24.219> the<00:02:24.489> oven<00:02:24.939> at<00:02:25.180> a<00:02:25.209> really<00:02:25.450> low

00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:25.569 
them on like in the oven at a really low

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:28.559 
them on like in the oven at a really low
temperature<00:02:26.400> but<00:02:27.400> i<00:02:27.430> think<00:02:27.819> the<00:02:27.969> lowest<00:02:28.150> in

00:02:28.559 --> 00:02:28.569 
temperature but i think the lowest in

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:30.809 
temperature but i think the lowest in
oven<00:02:28.900> will<00:02:29.079> go<00:02:29.349> some<00:02:29.859> will<00:02:30.040> go<00:02:30.219> like<00:02:30.489> a<00:02:30.519> hundred

00:02:30.809 --> 00:02:30.819 
oven will go some will go like a hundred

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:32.819 
oven will go some will go like a hundred
degrees<00:02:30.969> which<00:02:31.510> would<00:02:31.689> be<00:02:31.780> perfect<00:02:32.260> because

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:32.829 
degrees which would be perfect because

00:02:32.829 --> 00:02:37.860 
degrees which would be perfect because
i'm<00:02:33.219> going<00:02:33.430> to<00:02:33.489> set<00:02:33.670> these<00:02:33.849> at<00:02:34.120> 105<00:02:35.519> so<00:02:36.870> maybe

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
i'm going to set these at 105 so maybe

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:40.159 
i'm going to set these at 105 so maybe
with<00:02:38.230> the<00:02:38.349> oven<00:02:38.739> open<00:02:39.159> you<00:02:39.280> could<00:02:39.459> dry<00:02:39.700> these

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:40.169 
with the oven open you could dry these

00:02:40.169 --> 00:02:43.080 
with the oven open you could dry these
drawing<00:02:41.169> them<00:02:41.470> they<00:02:41.709> take<00:02:42.010> about<00:02:42.280> 8<00:02:42.639> to<00:02:42.849> 12

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
drawing them they take about 8 to 12

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:46.460 
drawing them they take about 8 to 12
hours<00:02:43.439> depends<00:02:44.439> on<00:02:44.560> the<00:02:44.799> size<00:02:45.040> of<00:02:45.310> the<00:02:45.430> almond

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
hours depends on the size of the almond

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.220 
hours depends on the size of the almond
oops<00:02:47.970> so<00:02:48.970> I'm<00:02:49.329> going<00:02:49.389> to<00:02:49.569> get<00:02:49.720> those<00:02:49.930> all<00:02:50.200> on

and then I'll put this outside to

00:03:01.359 --> 00:03:08.789 
and then I'll put this outside to

00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:15.489 
them for 10 hours in water and then I

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:18.779 
them for 10 hours in water and then I
put<00:04:16.030> them<00:04:16.150> on<00:04:16.269> these<00:04:16.509> dehydrator<00:04:17.289> trays<00:04:17.709> and<00:04:18.190> I

00:04:18.779 --> 00:04:18.789 
put them on these dehydrator trays and I

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:21.750 
put them on these dehydrator trays and I
dried<00:04:19.150> them<00:04:19.180> at<00:04:19.750> 105<00:04:20.590> degrees<00:04:20.650> this<00:04:21.489> is

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:21.760 
dried them at 105 degrees this is

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:25.980 
dried them at 105 degrees this is
excalibur<00:04:22.690> dehydrator<00:04:22.740> and<00:04:24.210> then<00:04:25.210> I<00:04:25.450> just<00:04:25.570> let

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:25.990 
excalibur dehydrator and then I just let

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:32.070 
excalibur dehydrator and then I just let
them<00:04:26.140> cool<00:04:26.980> overnight<00:04:27.570> and<00:04:30.720> they're<00:04:31.720> nice<00:04:31.840> and

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:32.080 
them cool overnight and they're nice and

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:36.950 
them cool overnight and they're nice and
crunchy<00:04:33.900> so<00:04:34.900> what's<00:04:35.140> really<00:04:35.320> nice<00:04:35.560> about<00:04:35.620> this

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:36.960 
crunchy so what's really nice about this

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:46.320 
crunchy so what's really nice about this
as<00:04:37.960> I<00:04:38.620> told<00:04:38.830> you<00:04:38.980> before<00:04:41.340> then<00:04:44.790> when<00:04:45.790> we<00:04:45.940> soak

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:46.330 
as I told you before then when we soak

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:51.030 
as I told you before then when we soak
them<00:04:48.180> nuts<00:04:49.180> without<00:04:50.050> being<00:04:50.470> soaked<00:04:50.800> are

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:51.040 
them nuts without being soaked are

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:54.360 
them nuts without being soaked are
having<00:04:52.000> an<00:04:52.240> anti<00:04:52.900> ends<00:04:53.290> on<00:04:53.410> quality<00:04:54.010> they're

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:54.370 
having an anti ends on quality they're

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:56.730 
having an anti ends on quality they're
very<00:04:54.520> hard<00:04:54.790> to<00:04:54.910> digest<00:04:55.440> because<00:04:56.440> they're

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:56.740 
very hard to digest because they're

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:00.450 
very hard to digest because they're
dormant<00:04:57.180> the<00:04:58.180> minute<00:04:58.480> you<00:04:58.630> soak<00:04:58.990> them<00:04:59.460> they

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:00.460 
dormant the minute you soak them they

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:03.750 
dormant the minute you soak them they
become<00:05:00.640> alive<00:05:01.150> and<00:05:01.570> they<00:05:02.520> quadruple<00:05:03.520> and

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:03.760 
become alive and they quadruple and

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:06.570 
become alive and they quadruple and
nutritional<00:05:04.420> content<00:05:05.070> so<00:05:06.070> they're<00:05:06.280> very<00:05:06.490> easy

to digest the fat content goes look down

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:12.660 
to digest the fat content goes look down
like<00:05:09.970> fifty<00:05:10.360> percent<00:05:10.780> and<00:05:11.640> they're<00:05:12.640> very

dehydrator I was thinking you could put
them<00:05:55.450> on<00:05:55.570> a<00:05:55.600> cookie<00:05:55.840> sheet<00:05:56.070> leave<00:05:57.070> your<00:05:57.280> oven

00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:57.730 
them on a cookie sheet leave your oven

00:05:57.730 --> 00:06:00.330 
them on a cookie sheet leave your oven
door<00:05:57.970> open<00:05:58.600> and<00:05:58.840> at<00:05:59.200> the<00:05:59.350> lowest<00:05:59.530> temperature

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:00.340

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:02.820 
door open and at the lowest temperature
dehydrate<00:06:01.090> them<00:06:01.330> now<00:06:01.990> I<00:06:02.020> don't<00:06:02.140> know<00:06:02.470> if

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:02.830 
dehydrate them now I don't know if

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:05.040 
dehydrate them now I don't know if
they'll<00:06:03.310> keep<00:06:03.610> the<00:06:03.820> ant<00:06:04.000> if<00:06:04.330> they'll<00:06:04.780> stay

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:05.050 
they'll keep the ant if they'll stay

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:08.340 
they'll keep the ant if they'll stay
alive<00:06:05.430> because<00:06:06.430> when<00:06:06.730> you<00:06:06.850> dehydrate<00:06:07.000> at<00:06:07.660> 105

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:08.350 
alive because when you dehydrate at 105

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:12.330 
alive because when you dehydrate at 105
the<00:06:08.680> enzymes<00:06:09.220> will<00:06:09.550> stay<00:06:09.790> alive<00:06:10.500> so<00:06:11.500> they're

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:12.340 
the enzymes will stay alive so they're

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:16.580 
the enzymes will stay alive so they're
feeding<00:06:12.640> your<00:06:12.910> body<00:06:14.280> you<00:06:15.280> can<00:06:15.490> do<00:06:15.640> it<00:06:15.820> with
