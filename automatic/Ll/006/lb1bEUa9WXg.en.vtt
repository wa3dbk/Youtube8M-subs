here's<00:00:01.620> a<00:00:01.680> state-space<00:00:02.159> diagram<00:00:02.790> for<00:00:03.179> a

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:03.210 
here's a state-space diagram for a

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.140 
here's a state-space diagram for a
simple<00:00:03.480> problem<00:00:03.680> it<00:00:04.680> involves<00:00:05.370> a<00:00:05.520> room<00:00:05.819> with

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:06.150 
simple problem it involves a room with

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.680 
simple problem it involves a room with
two<00:00:06.690> locations<00:00:07.290> the<00:00:07.470> left<00:00:08.280> we<00:00:08.790> call<00:00:09.030> a<00:00:09.300> and<00:00:09.599> the

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
two locations the left we call a and the

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.499 
two locations the left we call a and the
right<00:00:09.840> we<00:00:09.990> call<00:00:10.200> B<00:00:10.469> and<00:00:10.969> in<00:00:11.969> that<00:00:12.269> environment

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
right we call B and in that environment

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.749 
right we call B and in that environment
there's<00:00:13.200> a<00:00:13.290> vacuum<00:00:13.740> cleaner<00:00:13.860> and<00:00:14.280> there<00:00:14.639> may

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
there's a vacuum cleaner and there may

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:16.700 
there's a vacuum cleaner and there may
or<00:00:14.880> may<00:00:15.000> not<00:00:15.030> be<00:00:15.360> dirt<00:00:15.630> in<00:00:15.839> either<00:00:16.379> of<00:00:16.470> the<00:00:16.680> two

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
or may not be dirt in either of the two

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.460 
or may not be dirt in either of the two
locations<00:00:17.420> and<00:00:18.420> so<00:00:18.570> that<00:00:18.720> gives<00:00:18.840> us<00:00:19.140> eight

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
locations and so that gives us eight

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.960 
locations and so that gives us eight
total<00:00:19.980> states<00:00:20.930> dirt<00:00:21.930> is<00:00:22.140> here<00:00:22.529> or<00:00:22.920> not<00:00:23.250> here<00:00:23.789> or

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
total states dirt is here or not here or

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.720 
total states dirt is here or not here or
not<00:00:24.150> and<00:00:24.510> the<00:00:25.019> vacuum<00:00:25.380> cleaner<00:00:25.680> is<00:00:26.039> here<00:00:26.460> or

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
not and the vacuum cleaner is here or

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.599 
not and the vacuum cleaner is here or
here<00:00:26.760> so<00:00:27.570> that's<00:00:27.689> 2<00:00:27.840> times<00:00:27.990> 2<00:00:28.230> times<00:00:28.410> 2<00:00:28.740> is<00:00:28.980> 8

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
here so that's 2 times 2 times 2 is 8

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:30.620 
here so that's 2 times 2 times 2 is 8
possible<00:00:30.090> States

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
possible States

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.209 
possible States
and<00:00:30.720> I've<00:00:31.199> drawn<00:00:31.380> here<00:00:31.410> the<00:00:31.740> state<00:00:31.949> space

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
and I've drawn here the state space

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.000 
and I've drawn here the state space
diagram<00:00:32.820> with<00:00:33.270> all<00:00:33.300> the<00:00:33.540> transitions<00:00:34.170> for<00:00:34.920> the

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
diagram with all the transitions for the

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.740 
diagram with all the transitions for the
3<00:00:35.190> possible<00:00:35.579> actions<00:00:35.969> and<00:00:36.180> the<00:00:36.239> actions<00:00:36.270> are

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
3 possible actions and the actions are

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.510 
3 possible actions and the actions are
moving<00:00:37.170> right<00:00:37.350> so<00:00:37.860> we'd<00:00:38.010> go<00:00:38.129> from<00:00:38.250> this<00:00:38.399> state

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
moving right so we'd go from this state

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.940 
moving right so we'd go from this state
to<00:00:38.790> this<00:00:38.820> state<00:00:38.969> moving<00:00:39.960> left<00:00:40.200> go<00:00:40.649> from<00:00:40.829> this

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
to this state moving left go from this

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.280 
to this state moving left go from this
state<00:00:41.040> to<00:00:41.190> this<00:00:41.399> state<00:00:41.460> and<00:00:42.140> sucking<00:00:43.140> up<00:00:43.230> dirt

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.290 
state to this state and sucking up dirt
you<00:00:43.920> go<00:00:44.070> from<00:00:44.250> this<00:00:44.370> state<00:00:44.489> to<00:00:44.730> this<00:00:44.789> state<00:00:44.910> for

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
you go from this state to this state for

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.119 
you go from this state to this state for
example<00:00:45.390> and<00:00:47.000> in<00:00:48.000> this<00:00:48.420> state<00:00:49.020> space<00:00:49.200> diagram

if we have a fully deterministic fully
observable<00:00:53.730> world<00:00:54.090> it's<00:00:54.719> easy<00:00:54.840> to<00:00:55.079> plan<00:00:55.289> say

observable world it's easy to plan say

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.099 
observable world it's easy to plan say
we<00:00:55.980> start<00:00:56.219> in<00:00:56.370> this<00:00:56.460> state<00:00:56.730> and<00:00:56.969> we<00:00:57.570> want<00:00:57.840> to<00:00:57.930> be

end up in a goal state where both sides
are<00:01:00.899> clean<00:01:01.199> we<00:01:02.070> can<00:01:02.100> execute<00:01:02.550> the<00:01:03.180> suck<00:01:03.690> dirt

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
are clean we can execute the suck dirt

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.380 
are clean we can execute the suck dirt
action<00:01:04.470> and<00:01:04.739> get<00:01:05.040> here<00:01:05.460> and<00:01:05.640> then<00:01:06.060> move<00:01:06.360> right

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
action and get here and then move right

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.410 
action and get here and then move right
and<00:01:06.960> then<00:01:07.409> suck<00:01:07.710> dirt<00:01:07.920> again<00:01:08.280> and<00:01:08.520> now<00:01:09.030> we<00:01:09.090> end

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
and then suck dirt again and now we end

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.719 
and then suck dirt again and now we end
up<00:01:09.600> in<00:01:09.900> a<00:01:09.990> goal<00:01:10.140> state<00:01:10.500> where<00:01:11.070> everything<00:01:11.430> is

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
up in a goal state where everything is

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.469 
up in a goal state where everything is
clean<00:01:12.830> now<00:01:13.830> suppose<00:01:14.490> our<00:01:14.640> robot<00:01:15.030> vacuum

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
clean now suppose our robot vacuum

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.050 
clean now suppose our robot vacuum
cleaners<00:01:15.750> sensors<00:01:16.170> break<00:01:16.380> down<00:01:16.650> and<00:01:17.369> so<00:01:17.580> the

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
cleaners sensors break down and so the

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.700 
cleaners sensors break down and so the
robot<00:01:18.360> can<00:01:18.390> no<00:01:18.659> longer<00:01:19.020> perceive<00:01:19.350> either

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
robot can no longer perceive either

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.190 
robot can no longer perceive either
which<00:01:20.040> location<00:01:20.580> that's<00:01:20.729> in<00:01:20.970> or<00:01:21.450> whether

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
which location that's in or whether

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.190 
which location that's in or whether
there's<00:01:22.470> any<00:01:22.619> dirt<00:01:23.270> so<00:01:24.270> we<00:01:24.509> now<00:01:24.630> have<00:01:24.960> an

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
there's any dirt so we now have an

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.649 
there's any dirt so we now have an
unobservable<00:01:25.799> or<00:01:26.280> sensorless<00:01:26.939> world<00:01:27.360> rather

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
unobservable or sensorless world rather

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.560 
unobservable or sensorless world rather
than<00:01:27.900> a<00:01:27.930> fully<00:01:28.170> observable<00:01:28.590> one<00:01:28.860> and<00:01:29.509> how<00:01:30.509> does

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
than a fully observable one and how does

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.030 
than a fully observable one and how does
the<00:01:30.750> agent<00:01:31.079> then<00:01:31.200> represent<00:01:31.740> the<00:01:31.829> state<00:01:32.009> of

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
the agent then represent the state of

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.850 
the agent then represent the state of
the<00:01:32.189> world<00:01:32.369> well<00:01:33.150> it<00:01:33.990> could<00:01:34.229> be<00:01:34.350> in<00:01:34.439> any<00:01:34.590> one<00:01:34.829> of

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
the world well it could be in any one of

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.969 
the world well it could be in any one of
these<00:01:35.070> eight<00:01:35.400> states<00:01:35.729> and<00:01:36.090> so<00:01:36.720> all<00:01:37.560> we<00:01:37.710> can<00:01:37.829> do

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
these eight states and so all we can do

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.969 
these eight states and so all we can do
to<00:01:38.009> represent<00:01:38.610> the<00:01:38.700> current<00:01:39.000> state<00:01:39.210> is

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:39.979 
to represent the current state is

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:43.069 
to represent the current state is
dropping<00:01:40.979> circular<00:01:41.759> box<00:01:42.000> around<00:01:42.540> everything

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
dropping circular box around everything

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:46.190 
dropping circular box around everything
and<00:01:43.290> say<00:01:43.979> I<00:01:44.280> know<00:01:44.579> I'm<00:01:44.909> somewhere<00:01:45.299> inside<00:01:45.780> here

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
and say I know I'm somewhere inside here

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.310 
and say I know I'm somewhere inside here
now<00:01:47.030> that<00:01:48.030> doesn't<00:01:48.270> seem<00:01:48.329> like<00:01:48.509> it<00:01:48.630> helps<00:01:48.840> very

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
now that doesn't seem like it helps very

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.590 
now that doesn't seem like it helps very
much<00:01:49.560> what<00:01:49.950> good<00:01:50.159> is<00:01:50.280> it<00:01:50.310> to<00:01:50.430> know<00:01:50.700> that<00:01:51.000> we

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
much what good is it to know that we

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.630 
much what good is it to know that we
don't<00:01:51.750> really<00:01:51.869> know<00:01:52.049> anything<00:01:52.079> at<00:01:52.530> all<00:01:52.649> but

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
don't really know anything at all but

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.609 
don't really know anything at all but
the<00:01:53.759> point<00:01:54.000> is<00:01:54.180> that<00:01:54.659> we<00:01:54.810> can<00:01:54.960> search<00:01:55.200> in<00:01:55.409> the

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
the point is that we can search in the

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.149 
the point is that we can search in the
state<00:01:56.090> space<00:01:57.090> of<00:01:57.509> belief<00:01:58.110> States<00:01:58.469> rather<00:01:58.979> than

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
state space of belief States rather than

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:02.539 
state space of belief States rather than
in<00:01:59.670> the<00:01:59.820> state<00:02:00.030> space<00:02:00.210> of<00:02:00.630> actual<00:02:01.170> spaces<00:02:01.710> so

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
in the state space of actual spaces so

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:03.980 
in the state space of actual spaces so
we<00:02:02.729> believe<00:02:02.909> that<00:02:03.090> we're<00:02:03.540> in<00:02:03.630> one<00:02:03.780> of<00:02:03.899> these

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
we believe that we're in one of these

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.649 
we believe that we're in one of these
eight<00:02:04.350> states<00:02:04.799> and<00:02:05.100> now<00:02:05.759> when<00:02:05.969> we<00:02:06.090> execute<00:02:06.390> an

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
eight states and now when we execute an

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.510 
eight states and now when we execute an
action<00:02:06.780> we're<00:02:07.500> going<00:02:07.530> to<00:02:07.710> get<00:02:07.860> to<00:02:08.069> another

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
action we're going to get to another

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.309 
action we're going to get to another
belief<00:02:08.940> state<00:02:09.209> let's<00:02:09.780> take<00:02:09.929> a<00:02:09.959> look<00:02:10.140> at<00:02:10.229> the

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
belief state let's take a look at the

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.800 
belief state let's take a look at the
how<00:02:10.410> that<00:02:10.440> works
