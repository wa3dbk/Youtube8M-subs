 The right trap and I 'll be back to leave. 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.810
 for you a system to the Perka 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:32.570
 syllables on the surface with the use of uece 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:35.760
 materials we will need 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:37.200
 Lets wish for a good one, and let 's hope. 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:41.130
 number 2 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:47.280
 sure is a float that carries a good 

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:49.859
 amount of feed blade also for 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.670
 to whip'm using here one 

00:00:49.859 --> 00:01:07.470
 line 0 40 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:01:11.280
 is a ball guide is working here 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:13.890
 with two colors a coffee with milk and 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.680
 one only affect the two things that 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:20.610
 more results 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:33.600
 besides the materials and equipment that I 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:37.040
 I usually get 10-25 pounds and it's a 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:45.030
 area well teacher teaching well the fish 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:51.930
 also a line and a line of four 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:54.780
 It does not have to be too many to have 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.610
 bearings there to make correct face 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.009
 so let's go to our montage 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.969
 come on, we 'll take our 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:02.610
 reel 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:06.619
 tilapia fishing can also be done 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.619
 with a reel I prefer the primer 

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:19.440
 buoy number 211 normal 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:22.700
 nokia uses here giving I go 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:28.439
 I already have it on my channel 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:31.909
 and have a look and it's going to have 

00:02:28.439 --> 00:02:31.909
 several good videos come out too 

00:02:36.859 --> 00:02:45.299
 beauty let's love our now here 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:53.849
 whip 0 40 

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:56.370
 more or less from one meter to one meter 

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:59.239
 It's a good way, it does not have to be much. 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:59.239
 marques 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:19.530
 own the omid here more or less a 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:23.310
 subway and let's tie our sun 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:26.610
 today I 'm using it here it's a 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:29.700
 young man who stole right one in riazan 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:32.819
 wine and a simple mission so guinha 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:35.519
 there are people who think that the global agreement is 

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:38.910
 very large role of tilapia is not 

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:40.799
 I usually always for fishing and because 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:44.400
 from the queue to be a very good fish to 

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:48.000
 eat peterka and gives a lot of result 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:51.239
 right way or do not call here now 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.209
 ours a sun put a ball here 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:57.239
 guide 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:04:02.720
 For now let's let her loose on the 

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:02.720
 line 1a mahaki 

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:20.289
 cut the leftovers 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:37.940
 let's go up here in the eye of evian 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:41.710
 capping hook here right node and we 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:44.900
 regulate here now our guide buoy 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:47.810
 counting there about four 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:54.949
 fingers from the drawing we go 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:05:02.199
 lock up with bim good staff 

00:04:54.949 --> 00:05:05.630
 our system ready right here 

00:05:02.199 --> 00:05:08.419
 this system works very well 

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:10.520
 has other variations on the plot of the 

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:14.080
 missang and two trips can put a 

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:18.770
 reason that also gives more result 

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:20.720
 in the precarious street of tilapia is not having 

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:22.580
 that make many pitches 

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:24.650
 it is advisable to put showing you 

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:29.260
 do not have to replace reason always 

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:35.479
 So what does this time consist of? 

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:38.080
 put action here serwa taken 

00:05:35.479 --> 00:05:41.990
 in time they have beating 

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:43.250
 flung how it's going to happen 

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:46.220
 the hook 

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:47.479
 the ball will be on the surface at the time 

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:50.240
 which she founded 

00:05:47.479 --> 00:05:52.970
 It's time for the slingshot, so this is what I 

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:55.960
 I would like to spend today and even 

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:55.960
 next and personal
