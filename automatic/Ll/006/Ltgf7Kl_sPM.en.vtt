00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:20.380
 the important buildings where you can perform actions 

00:00:20.379 --> 00:00:23.749
 at the market square in the center of the city 

00:00:23.749 --> 00:00:28.439
 then often comes to play in the port of Wyk route click on him 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:29.409
 select 

00:00:29.409 --> 00:00:32.409
 Alternatively, you can also press on the convoy sponsors 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.180
 the characteristics of a convoy are now displayed on the right side of the convoy 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:41.540
 from a ship and has no goods loaded 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:44.200
 now that the convoy is selected 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.470
 let's do the first act 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:50.880
 click on the market hall or a port crane around the commercial register 

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:52.250
 to open 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:55.870
 Here you can trade between LÃ¼beck and a convoy 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:59.740
 we look at the goods Seitz the amount the Hilbeck currently 

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:01.699
 has in the third column 

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:03.410
 next to it is the price 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:07.700
 At the front of the bar we can see how big the needs of the city 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.530
 For the beginning, you should be following markets 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:14.530
 only buy when the stock split two 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:17.960
 the salt is produced in the world 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:22.340
 what one fights for the small gear is the stock and the price of the goods 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:23.560
 Well 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.760
 To buy a product click on the price 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:31.350
 the paths then the bar to the right to select the number of goods 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.570
 The more you buy, the more expensive the price per item was 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:38.659
 in the price depends on supply and demand 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.210
 and when the supply goes down the price goes up 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:46.630
 in this example I buy 100 almost said it 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:48.509
 the goods are first bought 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.160
 after I release the mouse button 

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:55.450
 Now I want to sell the salt in a city where it does not produce 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:56.130
 becomes 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.180
 I close the commercial register and click on the wait to leave the 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.440
 city 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:05.760
 the nautical chart is displayed and the convoy is still selected 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:08.129
 She sent him to Aalborg 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:11.129
 There meat is made and preserved with salt 

00:02:11.679 --> 00:02:12.570
 The animals are still 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:14.179
 5 

00:02:14.179 --> 00:02:17.169
 with the space bar one accelerates the time 

00:02:17.169 --> 00:02:20.679
 once you have arrived convoy may enter the city 

00:02:20.679 --> 00:02:23.549
 click to load the city 

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:26.549
 Now I need the commercial register again 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:30.459
 the travel offer is low Aalborg 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:33.639
 the price is much higher than the little shown 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:38.609
 To sell the goods, I click again on the price and push the 

00:02:38.609 --> 00:02:41.669
 Slider to the left then I release the mouse button 

00:02:42.889 --> 00:02:45.399
 two things left 

00:02:45.399 --> 00:02:47.949
 in the 4 8 0 points 

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:49.119
 also 

00:02:49.119 --> 00:02:52.259
 Each action area has an info icon 

00:02:52.259 --> 00:02:55.549
