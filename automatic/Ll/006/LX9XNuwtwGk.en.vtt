new reputation method to you guys but
I'm<00:02:40.830> sure<00:02:41.010> rockstar<00:02:41.370> would<00:02:41.430> have<00:02:41.550> looked<00:02:41.640> into

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
I'm sure rockstar would have looked into

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:43.460 
I'm sure rockstar would have looked into
this<00:02:42.030> before<00:02:42.390> they<00:02:42.480> added<00:02:42.720> that<00:02:42.750> so<00:02:43.170> you<00:02:43.230> know

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
this before they added that so you know

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:44.890 
this before they added that so you know
don't<00:02:43.860> get<00:02:43.950> your<00:02:44.010> hopes<00:02:44.070> up<00:02:44.370> anytime<00:02:44.580> soon

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
don't get your hopes up anytime soon

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.420 
don't get your hopes up anytime soon
anyway<00:02:45.900> moving<00:02:46.110> on<00:02:46.470> from<00:02:46.770> that<00:02:46.980> I<00:02:47.040> think<00:02:47.340> the

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
anyway moving on from that I think the

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.160 
anyway moving on from that I think the
final<00:02:47.700> thing<00:02:47.850> I'm<00:02:48.120> going<00:02:48.240> to<00:02:48.360> talk<00:02:48.600> about<00:02:48.840> is

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
final thing I'm going to talk about is

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.680 
final thing I'm going to talk about is
the<00:02:49.230> purchase<00:02:50.040> or<00:02:50.190> I'm<00:02:50.370> option<00:02:50.820> so<00:02:51.210> basically

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
the purchase or I'm option so basically

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:53.780 
the purchase or I'm option so basically
at<00:02:51.810> the<00:02:51.960> moment<00:02:52.320> you<00:02:52.800> can<00:02:52.980> pretty<00:02:53.130> much<00:02:53.220> by<00:02:53.550> all

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
at the moment you can pretty much by all

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.970 
at the moment you can pretty much by all
ammo<00:02:54.090> for<00:02:54.270> your<00:02:54.390> weapons<00:02:54.750> cheaper<00:02:55.230> in<00:02:55.770> this

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
ammo for your weapons cheaper in this

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.160 
ammo for your weapons cheaper in this
option<00:02:56.460> then<00:02:56.730> you<00:02:56.850> do<00:02:56.970> in<00:02:57.180> actual<00:02:57.450> stores<00:02:57.840> and

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
option then you do in actual stores and

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:59.570 
option then you do in actual stores and
that<00:02:58.620> is<00:02:58.710> all<00:02:58.830> pretty<00:02:58.920> much<00:02:59.100> going<00:02:59.250> to<00:02:59.310> change

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
that is all pretty much going to change

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:00.890 
that is all pretty much going to change
and<00:02:59.880> they're<00:03:00.000> going<00:03:00.120> to<00:03:00.180> be<00:03:00.270> pretty<00:03:00.690> much

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
and they're going to be pretty much

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.570 
and they're going to be pretty much
revamping<00:03:01.440> the<00:03:01.560> value<00:03:01.830> to<00:03:01.860> actually<00:03:02.340> match

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
revamping the value to actually match

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:04.820 
revamping the value to actually match
the<00:03:02.790> store<00:03:03.120> value<00:03:03.420> and<00:03:03.660> that<00:03:04.470> is<00:03:04.560> pretty<00:03:04.680> much

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:04.830 
the store value and that is pretty much

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:06.170 
the store value and that is pretty much
