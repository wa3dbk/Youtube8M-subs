00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:06.550
 today we are going to make bone cake 

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:09.160
 these are the ingredients 

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:11.440
 a pack of wafers one or two cans of 

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:13.740
 nutella and a mold similar to that of 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:13.740
 Photo 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:18.230
 we take the nutella we heat it in the 

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:19.189
 microwave until it is a little 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:21.199
 liquid 

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:25.539
 we put a wafer inside the mold and 

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:25.539
 we spread the first layer of nutella 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:33.180
 Y 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.970
 when we have a thin layer of nutella 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.550
 Throughout the base we add another wafer and 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:41.040
 we repeat the operation 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.079
 and so on until we run out of wafers 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.590
 without guardianship or until we tire of 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.590
 make floor 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:56.440
 do not 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:07.610
 and us to make this cake of this 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:17.540
 height we had to use two 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:19.400
 whole nutella pots from this 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:22.240
 image you can better appreciate the height 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:24.520
 who has the cake 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.840
 the mold that I told you at the beginning goes 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:29.909
 well so that when we export the 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.909
 nutella do not move the wafers 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:45.750
 in the final wafer we will break them 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.370
 quite more nutella to cover all 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.050
 the surface well since if we want 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:51.660
 we can add some kind of 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:53.100
 decoration as you see in the video after 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:54.660
 we left her a couple of hours in the 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.080
 refrigerator and I would be ready to 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:57.080
 eat it
