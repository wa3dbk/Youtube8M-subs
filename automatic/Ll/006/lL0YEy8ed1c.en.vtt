00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
of set under the precipice that time is

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.189 
of set under the precipice that time is
breaking<00:00:30.000> down<00:00:30.029> and<00:00:30.330> you<00:00:30.720> have<00:00:30.900> to<00:00:31.019> do

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
breaking down and you have to do

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.590 
breaking down and you have to do
something<00:00:31.470> to<00:00:31.800> stop<00:00:31.859> it<00:00:32.099> and<00:00:32.430> your<00:00:33.120> character

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
something to stop it and your character

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:34.610 
something to stop it and your character
there<00:00:33.930> are<00:00:33.989> actually<00:00:34.079> two<00:00:34.350> playable

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
there are actually two playable

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.250 
there are actually two playable
characters<00:00:35.130> and<00:00:35.370> both<00:00:36.329> of<00:00:36.360> them<00:00:36.660> have<00:00:36.930> the

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
characters and both of them have the

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.470 
characters and both of them have the
ability<00:00:37.680> to<00:00:37.710> manipulate<00:00:38.520> time<00:00:39.090> and<00:00:39.149> that's

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
ability to manipulate time and that's

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.479 
ability to manipulate time and that's
becomes<00:00:40.320> a<00:00:40.469> big<00:00:40.649> part<00:00:40.860> of<00:00:40.920> the<00:00:41.040> gameplay

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
becomes a big part of the gameplay

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.520 
becomes a big part of the gameplay
mechanic<00:00:41.969> you<00:00:42.480> probably<00:00:42.809> saw<00:00:43.050> in<00:00:43.379> the<00:00:43.500> trailer

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
mechanic you probably saw in the trailer

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.500 
mechanic you probably saw in the trailer
the<00:00:43.980> part<00:00:44.219> where<00:00:44.370> time<00:00:44.700> has<00:00:44.730> essentially

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
the part where time has essentially

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.540 
the part where time has essentially
frozen<00:00:46.020> and<00:00:46.230> you're<00:00:46.620> able<00:00:46.770> to<00:00:47.039> sort<00:00:47.250> of<00:00:47.340> move

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
frozen and you're able to sort of move

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.510 
frozen and you're able to sort of move
things<00:00:47.820> around<00:00:47.969> and<00:00:48.300> manipulate<00:00:48.420> them<00:00:49.520> it

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
things around and manipulate them it

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:51.950 
things around and manipulate them it
doesn't<00:00:50.969> seem<00:00:51.090> like<00:00:51.120> there's<00:00:51.420> really<00:00:51.629> a<00:00:51.719> right

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
doesn't seem like there's really a right

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.049 
doesn't seem like there's really a right
or<00:00:52.079> wrong<00:00:52.260> answer<00:00:52.289> here<00:00:52.739> it's<00:00:53.160> almost<00:00:53.579> like<00:00:54.030> a

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
or wrong answer here it's almost like a

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.389 
or wrong answer here it's almost like a
choose<00:00:54.449> your<00:00:54.480> own<00:00:54.660> adventure<00:00:54.780> game<00:00:55.410> and<00:00:55.710> they

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
choose your own adventure game and they

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.819 
choose your own adventure game and they
were<00:00:56.460> actually<00:00:56.870> very<00:00:57.870> certain<00:00:58.379> to<00:00:58.500> steer

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
were actually very certain to steer

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.979 
were actually very certain to steer
clear<00:00:59.070> of<00:00:59.219> that<00:00:59.699> phrase<00:01:00.030> when<00:01:00.329> describing<00:01:00.600> it

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
clear of that phrase when describing it

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.229 
clear of that phrase when describing it
but<00:01:01.199> that<00:01:01.440> really<00:01:01.739> is<00:01:02.010> what<00:01:02.039> it's<00:01:02.550> like<00:01:02.640> you'll

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
but that really is what it's like you'll

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:04.850 
but that really is what it's like you'll
be<00:01:03.420> able<00:01:03.510> to<00:01:03.780> do<00:01:03.960> things<00:01:04.140> in<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:04.439> game<00:01:04.589> and

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
be able to do things in the game and

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.039 
be able to do things in the game and
it'll<00:01:05.189> have<00:01:05.760> a<00:01:05.820> lot<00:01:06.119> of<00:01:06.150> effects<00:01:06.570> elsewhere

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
it'll have a lot of effects elsewhere

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.020 
it'll have a lot of effects elsewhere
there<00:01:07.560> are<00:01:07.680> two<00:01:07.860> really<00:01:08.310> interesting<00:01:08.820> things

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
there are two really interesting things

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.030 
there are two really interesting things
going<00:01:09.240> on<00:01:09.600> with<00:01:09.780> this<00:01:09.869> game<00:01:10.110> that<00:01:10.500> I<00:01:10.799> don't

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
going on with this game that I don't

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.380 
going on with this game that I don't
think<00:01:11.220> I've<00:01:11.310> been<00:01:11.520> done<00:01:11.670> before<00:01:11.820> at<00:01:12.150> least<00:01:12.330> not

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
think I've been done before at least not

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.020 
think I've been done before at least not
to<00:01:12.570> my<00:01:12.659> knowledge<00:01:12.689> the<00:01:13.350> first<00:01:13.650> is<00:01:13.950> that<00:01:14.030> they

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
to my knowledge the first is that they

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.010 
to my knowledge the first is that they
announced<00:01:15.450> during<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:15.810> press<00:01:15.990> conference

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
announced during the press conference

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.230 
announced during the press conference
that<00:01:16.560> it's<00:01:16.740> going<00:01:16.890> to<00:01:16.950> tie<00:01:17.130> in<00:01:17.310> with<00:01:17.490> a<00:01:17.520> TV<00:01:18.000> show

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
that it's going to tie in with a TV show

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.929 
that it's going to tie in with a TV show
what<00:01:19.170> I<00:01:19.320> didn't<00:01:19.650> realize<00:01:19.799> is<00:01:20.369> that<00:01:20.490> that<00:01:20.640> TV

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
what I didn't realize is that that TV

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.810 
what I didn't realize is that that TV
show<00:01:20.970> actually<00:01:21.720> ships<00:01:22.170> with<00:01:22.680> the<00:01:22.979> game<00:01:23.189> so<00:01:23.670> the

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
show actually ships with the game so the

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.850 
show actually ships with the game so the
game<00:01:24.000> they<00:01:24.630> said<00:01:24.869> the<00:01:25.020> pacing<00:01:25.409> is<00:01:25.530> very

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
game they said the pacing is very

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.219 
game they said the pacing is very
episodic<00:01:26.479> so<00:01:27.479> I<00:01:27.509> don't<00:01:27.840> know<00:01:27.900> if<00:01:27.990> that<00:01:28.110> means

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
episodic so I don't know if that means

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.050 
episodic so I don't know if that means
that<00:01:28.500> the<00:01:28.650> first<00:01:29.009> game<00:01:29.310> that<00:01:29.520> comes<00:01:29.700> out<00:01:29.880> is

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
that the first game that comes out is

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.819 
that the first game that comes out is
going<00:01:30.270> to<00:01:30.329> be<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:30.509> entire<00:01:30.869> first<00:01:31.290> season<00:01:31.439> it

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
going to be the entire first season it

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.069 
going to be the entire first season it
sort<00:01:32.040> of<00:01:32.130> seemed<00:01:32.490> that<00:01:32.759> way<00:01:32.970> based<00:01:33.270> on<00:01:33.420> what

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
sort of seemed that way based on what

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.410 
sort of seemed that way based on what
they<00:01:34.200> were<00:01:34.259> implying<00:01:34.880> but<00:01:35.880> it<00:01:36.000> seems<00:01:36.240> like

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
they were implying but it seems like

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.630 
they were implying but it seems like
your<00:01:36.990> actions<00:01:37.530> in<00:01:37.680> the<00:01:37.770> game<00:01:37.920> are<00:01:38.189> going<00:01:38.490> to

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
your actions in the game are going to

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.899 
your actions in the game are going to
influence<00:01:39.329> a<00:01:39.689> live-action<00:01:40.470> television<00:01:41.159> show

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
influence a live-action television show

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.440 
influence a live-action television show
that<00:01:42.689> ties<00:01:43.049> in<00:01:43.560> with<00:01:43.890> the<00:01:44.100> game<00:01:44.340> so<00:01:45.000> the<00:01:45.329> way

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
that ties in with the game so the way

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:46.999 
that ties in with the game so the way
this<00:01:45.630> works<00:01:45.689> is<00:01:46.140> you're<00:01:46.619> probably<00:01:46.710> thinking

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
this works is you're probably thinking

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.980 
this works is you're probably thinking
how<00:01:47.250> can<00:01:47.549> something<00:01:47.759> that<00:01:47.970> I<00:01:48.119> do<00:01:48.180> influence

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
how can something that I do influence

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.270 
how can something that I do influence
live<00:01:49.290> action<00:01:49.680> because<00:01:49.890> that<00:01:49.979> has<00:01:50.100> to<00:01:50.220> be

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
live action because that has to be

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.569 
live action because that has to be
pre-recorded<00:01:51.530> not<00:01:52.530> true<00:01:52.799> apparently<00:01:53.430> they

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
pre-recorded not true apparently they

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.880 
pre-recorded not true apparently they
have<00:01:53.759> created<00:01:54.000> digital<00:01:54.720> doubles<00:01:55.200> of<00:01:55.500> all<00:01:55.740> of

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
have created digital doubles of all of

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.749 
have created digital doubles of all of
the<00:01:55.979> actors<00:01:56.520> in<00:01:57.000> the<00:01:57.509> game<00:01:57.780> so<00:01:58.350> they<00:01:58.950> can<00:01:59.250> make

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
the actors in the game so they can make

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.940 
the actors in the game so they can make
them<00:02:00.000> do<00:02:00.210> anything<00:02:00.869> that<00:02:01.229> they<00:02:01.409> want<00:02:01.560> to<00:02:01.799> do

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
them do anything that they want to do

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.980 
them do anything that they want to do
basically<00:02:02.369> it's<00:02:02.909> a<00:02:03.060> very<00:02:03.360> interesting<00:02:03.570> and

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
basically it's a very interesting and

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.590 
basically it's a very interesting and
unique<00:02:04.170> concept<00:02:04.890> I<00:02:05.100> don't<00:02:05.820> know<00:02:06.000> exactly<00:02:06.390> how

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
unique concept I don't know exactly how

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.089 
unique concept I don't know exactly how
it's<00:02:06.869> going<00:02:07.049> to<00:02:07.079> work<00:02:07.140> in<00:02:07.500> a<00:02:07.560> game<00:02:07.740> like<00:02:07.770> this

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
it's going to work in a game like this

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.430 
it's going to work in a game like this
but<00:02:08.819> I<00:02:08.879> trust<00:02:09.239> them<00:02:09.420> because<00:02:09.539> its<00:02:09.840> remedy<00:02:10.170> and

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
but I trust them because its remedy and

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.110 
but I trust them because its remedy and
they're<00:02:10.679> so<00:02:10.920> good<00:02:11.160> at<00:02:11.310> interactive

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:15.599 
they said that during the demo they said

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:16.490

weren't<00:02:30.060> able<00:02:30.299> to<00:02:30.569> see<00:02:30.750> during<00:02:31.049> our<00:02:31.230> demo<00:02:31.530> at

mechanics<00:02:35.519> I'm<00:02:36.269> a<00:02:36.329> little<00:02:36.720> worried<00:02:36.930> about

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
mechanics I'm a little worried about

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.319 
mechanics I'm a little worried about
that<00:02:37.349> because<00:02:37.620> they<00:02:38.400> did<00:02:38.670> spend<00:02:38.970> the<00:02:39.060> entire

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:39.329 
that because they did spend the entire

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:41.089 
that because they did spend the entire
demo<00:02:39.629> talking<00:02:40.200> about<00:02:40.379> how<00:02:40.590> it<00:02:40.739> is<00:02:40.829> a<00:02:40.859> very

00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:41.099 
demo talking about how it is a very

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:43.099 
demo talking about how it is a very
story<00:02:41.549> driven<00:02:41.790> game<00:02:41.970> so<00:02:42.569> I<00:02:42.599> don't<00:02:42.870> know<00:02:42.959> if<00:02:43.049> I

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:43.109 
story driven game so I don't know if I

00:02:43.109 --> 00:02:44.539
