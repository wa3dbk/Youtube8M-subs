00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:13.520 
and then reading defenses I know defense

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:15.880 
and then reading defenses I know defense
is<00:04:13.640> way<00:04:13.760> better<00:04:13.970> as<00:04:14.180> a<00:04:14.240> whole<00:04:14.390> now<00:04:14.540> too<00:04:14.890> weird

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:15.890 
is way better as a whole now too weird

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:17.470 
is way better as a whole now too weird
to<00:04:15.920> think<00:04:15.980> of<00:04:16.160> the<00:04:16.220> competition<00:04:16.519> between<00:04:17.030> poor

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:17.480 
to think of the competition between poor

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:19.630 
to think of the competition between poor
guys<00:04:17.660> normally<00:04:18.080> it's<00:04:18.830> kind<00:04:19.040> of<00:04:19.070> one-on-one<00:04:19.370> or

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:19.640 
guys normally it's kind of one-on-one or

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:21.160 
guys normally it's kind of one-on-one or
something<00:04:20.000> think<00:04:20.180> I<00:04:20.209> ever<00:04:20.360> beat<00:04:20.630> this<00:04:20.780> guy<00:04:20.989> and

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:21.170 
something think I ever beat this guy and

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:23.500 
something think I ever beat this guy and
good<00:04:21.320> when<00:04:21.680> it's<00:04:21.799> for<00:04:22.130> visit<00:04:22.580> that<00:04:23.180> change<00:04:23.390> the

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:23.510 
good when it's for visit that change the

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:24.790 
good when it's for visit that change the
dynamics<00:04:23.900> of<00:04:23.930> the<00:04:24.020> competition<00:04:24.260> a<00:04:24.500> little<00:04:24.590> bit

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:24.800 
dynamics of the competition a little bit

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:26.590 
dynamics of the competition a little bit
no<00:04:25.400> not<00:04:25.580> really<00:04:25.760> I<00:04:25.880> mean<00:04:25.940> it's<00:04:26.240> a<00:04:26.330> competition

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:26.600

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:42.980 
before here that's quite a bit of

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:44.710
