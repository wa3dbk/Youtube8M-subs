had before so you know at least what's
in<00:00:56.579> the<00:00:56.670> plane<00:00:56.850> right<00:00:57.030> now<00:00:57.059> now<00:00:57.660> you<00:00:57.719> are

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899

throwing<00:00:58.079> in<00:00:58.230> a<00:00:58.350> lot<00:00:58.500> of<00:00:58.590> content<00:00:58.890> it<00:00:59.129> was<00:00:59.250> a

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
throwing in a lot of content it was a

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.369 
throwing in a lot of content it was a
bit<00:00:59.640> of<00:00:59.730> a<00:00:59.760> no<00:00:59.879> decision<00:01:00.300> then<00:01:00.600> I<00:01:00.870> think<00:01:01.140> on<00:01:01.260> the

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
bit of a no decision then I think on the

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:02.990 
bit of a no decision then I think on the
user's<00:01:01.649> part<00:01:01.860> 2<00:01:02.010> only<00:01:02.399> had<00:01:02.489> five<00:01:02.699> levels

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
user's part 2 only had five levels

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.789 
user's part 2 only had five levels
rather<00:01:03.149> than<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:03.420> 10<00:01:03.600> we<00:01:03.750> saw<00:01:03.960> in<00:01:04.170> Wrath<00:01:04.769> and

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
rather than the 10 we saw in Wrath and

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.230 
rather than the 10 we saw in Wrath and
we<00:01:05.100> saw<00:01:05.219> and<00:01:05.339> burning<00:01:05.549> crusade<00:01:05.850> what<00:01:06.000> was<00:01:06.119> that

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
we saw and burning crusade what was that

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.669 
we saw and burning crusade what was that
well<00:01:06.840> it's<00:01:06.960> definitely<00:01:07.109> a<00:01:07.289> break<00:01:07.439> from<00:01:07.560> the

00:01:07.669 --> 00:01:07.679 
well it's definitely a break from the

00:01:07.679 --> 00:01:09.769 
well it's definitely a break from the
norm<00:01:07.709> but<00:01:08.249> I<00:01:08.459> think<00:01:08.700> we're<00:01:08.850> doing<00:01:09.329> what<00:01:09.630> we

00:01:09.769 --> 00:01:09.779 
norm but I think we're doing what we

00:01:09.779 --> 00:01:11.719 
norm but I think we're doing what we
feel<00:01:10.079> like<00:01:10.109> the<00:01:10.590> playerbase<00:01:10.859> wants<00:01:11.369> us<00:01:11.490> to<00:01:11.609> do

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
feel like the playerbase wants us to do

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.879 
feel like the playerbase wants us to do
and<00:01:12.060> that<00:01:12.270> there<00:01:13.259> are<00:01:13.350> a<00:01:13.380> lot<00:01:13.499> of<00:01:13.529> players<00:01:13.770> that

00:01:13.879 --> 00:01:13.889 
and that there are a lot of players that

00:01:13.889 --> 00:01:16.039 
and that there are a lot of players that
when<00:01:14.609> a<00:01:14.639> new<00:01:14.789> expansion<00:01:15.240> comes<00:01:15.420> out<00:01:15.630> what<00:01:15.929> they

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
when a new expansion comes out what they

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.569 
when a new expansion comes out what they
try<00:01:16.319> to<00:01:16.350> do<00:01:16.560> is<00:01:16.649> they<00:01:16.770> just<00:01:16.889> try<00:01:17.039> to<00:01:17.100> get<00:01:17.249> the

00:01:17.569 --> 00:01:17.579 
try to do is they just try to get the

00:01:17.579 --> 00:01:18.830 
try to do is they just try to get the
level<00:01:17.850> cap<00:01:17.969> again<00:01:18.119> so<00:01:18.450> they<00:01:18.539> can<00:01:18.659> do<00:01:18.749> the

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
level cap again so they can do the

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.809 
level cap again so they can do the
endgame<00:01:19.079> content<00:01:19.289> at<00:01:20.099> the<00:01:20.249> same<00:01:20.399> time<00:01:20.579> there

00:01:35.269 --> 00:01:35.279 
characters like having a lot of

00:01:35.279 --> 00:01:37.760 
characters like having a lot of
different<00:01:35.549> tunes<00:01:35.729> tend<00:01:36.569> to<00:01:36.810> you<00:01:37.380> know<00:01:37.409> like<00:01:37.740> i

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
different tunes tend to you know like i

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.039 
different tunes tend to you know like i
said<00:01:37.889> create<00:01:38.459> a<00:01:38.490> whole<00:01:38.639> lot<00:01:38.819> of<00:01:38.849> them<00:01:38.969> so<00:01:39.569> we

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
said create a whole lot of them so we

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.870 
said create a whole lot of them so we
want<00:01:40.229> them<00:01:40.409> to<00:01:40.439> feel<00:01:41.069> like<00:01:41.279> they<00:01:41.340> got<00:01:41.549> a<00:01:41.609> lot<00:01:41.849> of

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
want them to feel like they got a lot of

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.249 
want them to feel like they got a lot of
new<00:01:42.119> stuff<00:01:42.149> as<00:01:42.539> they<00:01:42.630> went<00:01:42.779> through<00:01:42.990> it<00:01:43.109> and

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
new stuff as they went through it and

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:44.749 
new stuff as they went through it and
sarah<00:01:43.439> rolling<00:01:43.829> up<00:01:43.950> their<00:01:44.069> third<00:01:44.369> or<00:01:44.579> fourth

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
sarah rolling up their third or fourth

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.749 
sarah rolling up their third or fourth
or<00:01:44.909> fifth<00:01:45.119> character<00:01:45.539> tenth<00:01:45.989> who<00:01:46.200> knows<00:01:46.759> sorry

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
or fifth character tenth who knows sorry

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.459 
or fifth character tenth who knows sorry
now<00:01:47.880> you're<00:01:48.029> also<00:01:48.149> adding<00:01:48.569> two<00:01:48.869> new<00:01:49.079> races

00:01:49.459 --> 00:01:49.469 
now you're also adding two new races

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:51.559 
now you're also adding two new races
which<00:01:49.649> is<00:01:49.829> a<00:01:50.069> big<00:01:50.520> move<00:01:50.729> but<00:01:50.909> no<00:01:51.060> need<00:01:51.209> classes

00:01:51.559 --> 00:01:51.569 
which is a big move but no need classes

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:53.719 
which is a big move but no need classes
why's<00:01:51.719> that<00:01:51.749> well<00:01:52.679> partially<00:01:53.069> because<00:01:53.310> we're

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
why's that well partially because we're

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.099 
why's that well partially because we're
you<00:01:54.060> know<00:01:54.149> we've<00:01:54.329> decided<00:01:54.659> to<00:01:54.779> go<00:01:54.869> with<00:01:54.959> the

00:01:55.099 --> 00:01:55.109 
you know we've decided to go with the

00:01:55.109 --> 00:01:56.870 
you know we've decided to go with the
two<00:01:55.289> new<00:01:55.409> races<00:01:55.770> this<00:01:55.919> time<00:01:56.159> we<00:01:56.369> feel<00:01:56.549> like<00:01:56.669> if

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
two new races this time we feel like if

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.849 
two new races this time we feel like if
we<00:01:56.909> if<00:01:57.689> we<00:01:57.749> added<00:01:58.020> a<00:01:58.200> new<00:01:58.349> character<00:01:58.590> class

00:01:58.849 --> 00:01:58.859 
we if we added a new character class

00:01:58.859 --> 00:02:00.519 
we if we added a new character class
with<00:01:59.069> every<00:01:59.309> expansion<00:01:59.639> we<00:02:00.029> would<00:02:00.179> probably

00:02:00.519 --> 00:02:00.529 
with every expansion we would probably

00:02:00.529 --> 00:02:03.319 
with every expansion we would probably
mess<00:02:01.529> up<00:02:01.739> the<00:02:01.859> game<00:02:02.039> pretty<00:02:02.340> soon<00:02:02.639> you<00:02:03.149> know<00:02:03.239> it

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
mess up the game pretty soon you know it

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:04.879 
mess up the game pretty soon you know it
wouldn't<00:02:03.479> take<00:02:03.659> that<00:02:03.689> long<00:02:03.869> for<00:02:04.079> the<00:02:04.529> classes

00:02:04.879 --> 00:02:04.889 
wouldn't take that long for the classes

00:02:04.889 --> 00:02:06.620 
wouldn't take that long for the classes
to<00:02:05.099> really<00:02:05.279> start<00:02:05.520> being<00:02:05.669> hybridized<00:02:06.119> become

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
to really start being hybridized become

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.570 
to really start being hybridized become
more<00:02:06.869> and<00:02:06.929> more<00:02:06.989> like<00:02:07.229> each<00:02:07.439> other<00:02:07.559> so<00:02:07.889> I<00:02:08.280> think

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
more and more like each other so I think

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:09.740 
more and more like each other so I think
we<00:02:08.729> have<00:02:08.759> to<00:02:08.910> be<00:02:08.970> very<00:02:09.149> careful<00:02:09.420> with<00:02:09.630> the

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
we have to be very careful with the

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.300 
we have to be very careful with the
introduction<00:02:10.229> of<00:02:10.289> new<00:02:10.410> classes<00:02:10.860> will

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
introduction of new classes will

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:12.800 
introduction of new classes will
probably<00:02:11.700> do<00:02:11.849> it<00:02:11.879> again<00:02:12.060> sometime<00:02:12.480> in<00:02:12.750> the

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
probably do it again sometime in the

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.199 
probably do it again sometime in the
future<00:02:12.959> but<00:02:13.829> i<00:02:14.099> wouldn't<00:02:14.489> expect<00:02:14.549> every

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:15.209 
future but i wouldn't expect every

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:16.250 
future but i wouldn't expect every
expansion<00:02:15.569> to<00:02:15.719> have<00:02:15.810> a<00:02:15.840> new<00:02:15.989> class

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
expansion to have a new class

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.050 
expansion to have a new class
so<00:02:16.590> that<00:02:16.890> that's<00:02:17.159> why<00:02:17.340> this<00:02:17.400> time<00:02:17.640> we<00:02:17.819> got<00:02:17.939> new

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
so that that's why this time we got new

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.000 
so that that's why this time we got new
races<00:02:18.420> what<00:02:18.840> is<00:02:18.959> the<00:02:19.110> selection<00:02:19.470> process<00:02:19.590> why

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
races what is the selection process why

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.610 
races what is the selection process why
why<00:02:20.340> worgen<00:02:20.760> and<00:02:21.000> why<00:02:21.299> Goblin<00:02:21.659> well<00:02:22.439> the

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
why worgen and why Goblin well the

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.649 
why worgen and why Goblin well the
selection<00:02:22.980> process<00:02:23.099> is<00:02:23.640> whatever<00:02:24.060> kind<00:02:24.569> of

00:02:24.649 --> 00:02:24.659 
selection process is whatever kind of

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:26.899 
selection process is whatever kind of
fits<00:02:25.049> within<00:02:25.349> the<00:02:25.530> the<00:02:25.739> scheme<00:02:26.459> of<00:02:26.670> what<00:02:26.790> we're

00:02:26.899 --> 00:02:26.909 
fits within the the scheme of what we're

00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:29.330 
fits within the the scheme of what we're
doing<00:02:26.939> for<00:02:27.239> the<00:02:27.360> expansion<00:02:27.629> and<00:02:28.200> what<00:02:29.189> also

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
doing for the expansion and what also

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:30.530 
doing for the expansion and what also
just<00:02:29.670> seems<00:02:29.849> like<00:02:30.060> it<00:02:30.180> would<00:02:30.239> be<00:02:30.299> really<00:02:30.450> cool

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
just seems like it would be really cool

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.869 
just seems like it would be really cool
the<00:02:31.409> goblins<00:02:31.769> have<00:02:31.980> been<00:02:32.159> one<00:02:32.400> that<00:02:32.640> people

00:02:32.869 --> 00:02:32.879 
the goblins have been one that people

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:34.580 
the goblins have been one that people
have<00:02:32.970> talked<00:02:33.209> about<00:02:33.450> since<00:02:33.810> the<00:02:33.959> game<00:02:34.319> came

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
have talked about since the game came

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.440 
have talked about since the game came
out<00:02:34.739> right<00:02:35.099> even<00:02:35.730> when<00:02:35.819> the<00:02:35.940> game<00:02:36.090> came<00:02:36.269> out

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
out right even when the game came out

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:37.819 
out right even when the game came out
there<00:02:36.659> were<00:02:36.750> people<00:02:37.019> on<00:02:37.170> the<00:02:37.319> team<00:02:37.470> there<00:02:37.769> were

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:37.829 
there were people on the team there were

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:39.500 
there were people on the team there were
players<00:02:38.040> that<00:02:38.489> were<00:02:38.610> kind<00:02:38.940> of<00:02:39.000> pushing<00:02:39.360> to

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
players that were kind of pushing to

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.330 
players that were kind of pushing to
make<00:02:39.690> goblins<00:02:40.319> a<00:02:40.409> playable<00:02:40.680> race<00:02:40.950> make<00:02:41.159> of<00:02:41.250> a

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
make goblins a playable race make of a

00:02:46.789 --> 00:02:46.799 
we're finally making that happen we also

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:48.440 
we're finally making that happen we also
felt<00:02:47.040> like<00:02:47.280> they<00:02:47.640> brought<00:02:47.909> a<00:02:47.939> lot<00:02:48.180> to<00:02:48.209> the

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
felt like they brought a lot to the

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:49.759 
felt like they brought a lot to the
horde<00:02:48.659> that<00:02:48.959> they're<00:02:49.079> going<00:02:49.319> to<00:02:49.409> bring<00:02:49.560> a<00:02:49.620> lot

horde that they're going to bring a lot
to<00:02:49.799> the<00:02:49.890> horde<00:02:50.129> because<00:02:50.430> they're<00:02:50.790> their

affect different zones to different

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.930 
affect different zones to different
degrees<00:04:21.320> but<00:04:22.320> the<00:04:22.530> general<00:04:22.860> idea<00:04:22.949> is<00:04:23.190> to<00:04:23.550> come

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940 
degrees but the general idea is to come

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:25.850 
degrees but the general idea is to come
away<00:04:24.030> from<00:04:24.210> it<00:04:24.510> with<00:04:24.659> a<00:04:24.690> feeling<00:04:25.139> like<00:04:25.380> the

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860 
away from it with a feeling like the

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:26.240 
away from it with a feeling like the
world

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:26.250 
world

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:27.860 
world
is<00:04:26.280> dynamic<00:04:26.850> the<00:04:26.970> world<00:04:27.150> changes<00:04:27.600> sometimes

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:27.870 
is dynamic the world changes sometimes

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:29.660 
is dynamic the world changes sometimes
that<00:04:28.500> not<00:04:28.650> everything<00:04:28.920> is<00:04:29.160> always<00:04:29.250> going<00:04:29.550> to

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:29.670 
that not everything is always going to

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:31.760 
that not everything is always going to
be<00:04:29.700> the<00:04:29.850> same<00:04:30.060> and<00:04:30.330> that<00:04:31.080> it's<00:04:31.500> interesting

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:31.770 
be the same and that it's interesting

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:34.100 
be the same and that it's interesting
because<00:04:32.100> that<00:04:32.490> you<00:04:33.420> know<00:04:33.480> I<00:04:33.510> think<00:04:33.750> that<00:04:33.870> we

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:34.110 
because that you know I think that we

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:35.630 
because that you know I think that we
hear<00:04:34.320> from<00:04:34.350> players<00:04:34.830> a<00:04:34.920> lot<00:04:35.100> of<00:04:35.220> times<00:04:35.400> that

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:35.640 
hear from players a lot of times that

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:37.550 
hear from players a lot of times that
they<00:04:35.760> wish<00:04:36.000> the<00:04:36.180> world<00:04:36.300> were<00:04:36.540> more<00:04:37.020> dynamic

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:37.560 
they wish the world were more dynamic

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:39.050 
they wish the world were more dynamic
and<00:04:37.710> so<00:04:38.010> we're<00:04:38.160> trying<00:04:38.190> to<00:04:38.400> help<00:04:38.670> make<00:04:38.910> that

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:39.060 
and so we're trying to help make that

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:41.030 
and so we're trying to help make that
happen<00:04:39.200> making<00:04:40.200> that<00:04:40.290> happen<00:04:40.410> not<00:04:40.680> only<00:04:40.740> with

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:41.040 
happen making that happen not only with

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:42.770 
happen making that happen not only with
the<00:04:41.070> Cataclysm<00:04:41.640> changes<00:04:42.060> but<00:04:42.300> also<00:04:42.420> with<00:04:42.660> the

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:42.780 
the Cataclysm changes but also with the

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:45.260 
the Cataclysm changes but also with the
phase<00:04:42.960> drain<00:04:43.290> kind<00:04:43.560> of<00:04:43.620> stuff<00:04:43.830> so<00:04:44.010> I<00:04:44.850> think<00:04:44.970> you

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:45.270 
phase drain kind of stuff so I think you

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:47.000 
phase drain kind of stuff so I think you
know<00:04:45.360> on<00:04:45.510> those<00:04:45.900> different<00:04:46.260> fronts<00:04:46.590> I<00:04:46.770> think

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:47.010 
know on those different fronts I think

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:49.370 
know on those different fronts I think
we<00:04:47.130> again<00:04:47.460> play<00:04:47.790> into<00:04:48.120> that<00:04:48.270> that<00:04:48.870> that

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:49.380 
we again play into that that that

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:51.350 
we again play into that that that
feeling<00:04:49.770> of<00:04:49.830> nostalgia<00:04:50.310> being<00:04:50.940> able<00:04:51.030> to<00:04:51.120> go<00:04:51.300> to

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:51.360 
feeling of nostalgia being able to go to

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:53.780 
feeling of nostalgia being able to go to
those<00:04:51.780> places<00:04:52.020> that<00:04:52.290> are<00:04:52.500> familiar<00:04:53.070> but<00:04:53.730> a

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:53.790 
those places that are familiar but a

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:55.370 
those places that are familiar but a
little<00:04:54.090> bit<00:04:54.210> different<00:04:54.510> now<00:04:54.660> and<00:04:55.050> kind<00:04:55.320> of

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:55.380 
little bit different now and kind of

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:56.870 
little bit different now and kind of
getting<00:04:55.530> to<00:04:55.680> replay<00:04:56.190> through<00:04:56.550> some<00:04:56.730> of<00:04:56.790> those

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:56.880 
getting to replay through some of those

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:58.550 
getting to replay through some of those
quest<00:04:57.180> lines<00:04:57.420> that<00:04:57.750> that<00:04:58.110> are<00:04:58.200> new<00:04:58.350> and

00:04:58.550 --> 00:04:58.560 
quest lines that that are new and

00:04:58.560 --> 00:04:59.990 
quest lines that that are new and
