if<00:00:59.789> we<00:00:59.940> turn<00:01:00.090> the<00:01:00.210> bike<00:01:00.359> on<00:01:00.570> here<00:01:00.870> you'll<00:01:01.469> find

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
if we turn the bike on here you'll find

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.650 
if we turn the bike on here you'll find
out<00:01:01.920> that<00:01:01.949> this<00:01:02.219> bike<00:01:02.430> does<00:01:02.730> have<00:01:03.000> indeed<00:01:03.420> have

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
out that this bike does have indeed have

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.649 
out that this bike does have indeed have
abs<00:01:04.519> it<00:01:05.519> has<00:01:05.729> this<00:01:05.820> system<00:01:06.060> called<00:01:06.420> linked

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
abs it has this system called linked

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.480 
abs it has this system called linked
braking<00:01:07.080> so<00:01:07.320> the<00:01:07.530> brakes<00:01:07.770> actually<00:01:08.130> work<00:01:08.310> in

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
braking so the brakes actually work in

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.039 
braking so the brakes actually work in
conjunction<00:01:08.700> with<00:01:09.060> each<00:01:09.210> other<00:01:09.450> if<00:01:09.780> you<00:01:09.930> using

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
conjunction with each other if you using

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.410 
conjunction with each other if you using
the<00:01:10.229> front<00:01:10.439> or<00:01:10.619> the<00:01:10.650> rear<00:01:10.799> also<00:01:11.610> traction

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
the front or the rear also traction

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.920 
the front or the rear also traction
control<00:01:12.810> this<00:01:13.710> bike<00:01:14.070> does<00:01:14.340> have<00:01:14.689> three<00:01:15.689> levels

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
control this bike does have three levels

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.990 
control this bike does have three levels
of<00:01:16.140> tracking<00:01:16.350> control<00:01:16.740> I<00:01:16.799> believe<00:01:16.890> if<00:01:17.759> I<00:01:17.850> can

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
of tracking control I believe if I can

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.440 
of tracking control I believe if I can
figure<00:01:18.180> out<00:01:18.270> how<00:01:18.450> to<00:01:18.540> use<00:01:18.750> it<00:01:18.780> I<00:01:19.880> don't<00:01:20.880> really

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
figure out how to use it I don't really

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.690 
figure out how to use it I don't really
know<00:01:21.659> but<00:01:22.140> has<00:01:22.860> three<00:01:23.100> levels<00:01:23.369> a<00:01:23.460> traction

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
know but has three levels a traction

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.410 
know but has three levels a traction
control<00:01:24.150> and<00:01:24.390> you<00:01:25.259> can<00:01:25.409> select<00:01:26.150> depending<00:01:27.150> on

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
control and you can select depending on

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.719 
control and you can select depending on
what<00:01:27.780> your<00:01:27.900> preference<00:01:28.259> is<00:01:28.320> I<00:01:28.470> guess<00:01:28.650> the<00:01:28.890> only

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
what your preference is I guess the only

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.069 
what your preference is I guess the only
thing<00:01:29.790> I<00:01:30.030> don't<00:01:30.090> really<00:01:30.390> like<00:01:30.600> about<00:01:30.900> this

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
thing I don't really like about this

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:36.440 
thing I don't really like about this
bike<00:01:31.290> so<00:01:31.560> far<00:01:31.590> is<00:01:32.390> it<00:01:33.390> has<00:01:33.650> alloy<00:01:34.650> rims<00:01:35.130> on<00:01:35.490> the

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
bike so far is it has alloy rims on the

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.010 
bike so far is it has alloy rims on the
front<00:01:36.869> and<00:01:37.079> the<00:01:37.200> rear<00:01:38.119> as<00:01:39.119> compared<00:01:39.600> to<00:01:39.659> spoke

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
front and the rear as compared to spoke

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.889 
front and the rear as compared to spoke
spoke<00:01:40.799> dreams<00:01:41.130> which<00:01:41.700> is<00:01:41.820> I<00:01:41.909> guess<00:01:41.939> not<00:01:42.450> too

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
spoke dreams which is I guess not too

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.080 
spoke dreams which is I guess not too
bad<00:01:43.140> I<00:01:43.470> mean<00:01:43.740> I<00:01:43.979> prefer<00:01:44.280> to<00:01:44.369> have<00:01:44.490> spoke<00:01:44.759> dreams

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
bad I mean I prefer to have spoke dreams

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.300 
bad I mean I prefer to have spoke dreams

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
it does actually have a 19-inch front

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.200 
it does actually have a 19-inch front
wheel<00:01:49.770> instead<00:01:50.009> of<00:01:50.100> a<00:01:50.159> 21<00:01:50.490> wheel<00:01:51.950> but<00:01:52.950> yeah

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:53.210 
wheel instead of a 21 wheel but yeah

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:55.069 
wheel instead of a 21 wheel but yeah
there's<00:01:54.210> a<00:01:54.299> lot<00:01:54.479> of<00:01:54.600> power<00:01:54.840> in<00:01:54.990> this

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
there's a lot of power in this

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:58.249 
there's a lot of power in this
