00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.689 
with no white showing through then let
this<00:00:54.750> dry<00:00:55.110> thoroughly<00:00:55.530> next<00:00:56.160> we<00:00:56.309> need<00:00:56.520> to

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
this dry thoroughly next we need to

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.540 
this dry thoroughly next we need to
create<00:00:56.910> the<00:00:57.329> galaxy<00:00:57.539> boundary<00:00:58.530> line<00:00:58.710> on<00:00:59.309> which

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
create the galaxy boundary line on which

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.299 
create the galaxy boundary line on which
to<00:00:59.760> use<00:00:59.969> as<00:01:00.149> a<00:01:00.180> rough<00:01:00.480> guide<00:01:00.710> use<00:01:01.710> a<00:01:01.739> pastel

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
to use as a rough guide use a pastel

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.729 
to use as a rough guide use a pastel
pencil<00:01:02.730> for<00:01:02.910> this<00:01:03.229> incidentally<00:01:04.229> this<00:01:04.530> will

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
pencil for this incidentally this will

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.980 
pencil for this incidentally this will
rub<00:01:04.979> off<00:01:05.129> and/or<00:01:05.880> consolidate<00:01:06.600> with<00:01:06.840> the

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
rub off and/or consolidate with the

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.800 
rub off and/or consolidate with the
paint<00:01:07.260> so<00:01:07.920> it's<00:01:08.130> just<00:01:08.369> an<00:01:08.580> intermediate<00:01:09.090> guide

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
paint so it's just an intermediate guide

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.469 
paint so it's just an intermediate guide
really<00:01:10.320> next<00:01:10.650> I<00:01:10.770> mark<00:01:11.040> the<00:01:11.220> area<00:01:11.580> of<00:01:11.760> the<00:01:12.090> globe

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479

into<00:02:10.729> the<00:02:10.850> background<00:02:11.450> you<00:02:12.230> can<00:02:12.410> then<00:02:12.590> apply

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 
into the background you can then apply

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.010 
into the background you can then apply
more<00:02:13.190> color<00:02:13.490> over<00:02:14.090> the<00:02:14.210> top<00:02:14.420> and<00:02:14.600> blend<00:02:14.840> that

I<00:04:30.350> saw<00:04:30.979> a<00:04:31.010> space<00:04:31.460> cloud<00:04:31.790> this<00:04:32.120> lavender<00:04:32.660> color

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:32.990 
I saw a space cloud this lavender color

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:34.930 
I saw a space cloud this lavender color
in<00:04:33.320> a<00:04:33.470> photo<00:04:33.740> and<00:04:34.280> I<00:04:34.370> thought<00:04:34.639> it<00:04:34.820> would

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:34.940 
in a photo and I thought it would

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:37.120 
in a photo and I thought it would
complement<00:04:35.510> the<00:04:35.690> composition<00:04:36.380> nicely<00:04:36.889> and

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:37.130 
complement the composition nicely and

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:39.340 
complement the composition nicely and
created<00:04:37.910> it<00:04:38.030> with<00:04:38.210> a<00:04:38.240> touch<00:04:38.720> of<00:04:38.750> violet

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:39.350 
created it with a touch of violet

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:43.240 
created it with a touch of violet
ultramarine<00:04:40.160> and<00:04:40.310> titanium<00:04:41.270> so<00:04:42.260> I<00:04:42.290> added<00:04:42.979> the

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:43.250 
ultramarine and titanium so I added the

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:45.340 
ultramarine and titanium so I added the
color<00:04:43.490> and<00:04:43.699> felt<00:04:44.120> it<00:04:44.300> was<00:04:44.389> a<00:04:44.419> bit<00:04:44.660> strong<00:04:45.110> and

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:45.350 
color and felt it was a bit strong and

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:47.620 
color and felt it was a bit strong and
