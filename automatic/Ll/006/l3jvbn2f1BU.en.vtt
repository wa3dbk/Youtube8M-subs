alloy<00:01:50.070> wheels<00:01:50.549> these<00:01:51.360> are<00:01:51.420> specifically

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
alloy wheels these are specifically

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.460 
alloy wheels these are specifically
shaped<00:01:52.799> to<00:01:53.700> have<00:01:54.119> less<00:01:54.450> rolling<00:01:54.720> resistance

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
shaped to have less rolling resistance

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.330 
shaped to have less rolling resistance
just<00:01:56.100> like<00:01:56.250> the<00:01:56.369> hf<00:01:57.439> just<00:01:58.439> a<00:01:58.560> different<00:01:58.950> design

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
just like the hf just a different design

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.420 
just like the hf just a different design
with<00:01:59.729> the<00:01:59.850> hybrid<00:02:00.000> went<00:02:00.930> with<00:02:01.079> a<00:02:01.110> dark<00:02:02.040> paint

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.760 
with the hybrid went with a dark paint
the<00:02:02.939> black<00:02:03.180> paint<00:02:03.450> just<00:02:03.750> like<00:02:03.930> the<00:02:04.409> rest<00:02:04.619> of

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
the black paint just like the rest of

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.529 
the black paint just like the rest of
the<00:02:04.860> 2013<00:02:05.700> models<00:02:06.060> just<00:02:06.600> like<00:02:06.810> the<00:02:07.020> civic<00:02:07.770> SI

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
the 2013 models just like the civic SI

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.539 
the 2013 models just like the civic SI
thinking<00:02:10.110> ex-model<00:02:10.590> over<00:02:10.950> here<00:02:11.129> so<00:02:11.310> a<00:02:11.340> little

00:02:11.539 --> 00:02:11.549 
thinking ex-model over here so a little

00:02:11.549 --> 00:02:14.179 
thinking ex-model over here so a little
bit<00:02:11.790> of<00:02:11.879> a<00:02:11.970> different<00:02:12.330> round<00:02:12.510> design<00:02:12.720> as<00:02:13.409> you

00:02:14.179 --> 00:02:14.189 
bit of a different round design as you

00:02:14.189 --> 00:02:16.280 
bit of a different round design as you
can<00:02:14.430> see<00:02:14.790> let's<00:02:15.329> move<00:02:15.480> to<00:02:15.629> the<00:02:15.720> front<00:02:15.900> really

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
can see let's move to the front really

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:24.259 
can see let's move to the front really
fast<00:02:20.420> so<00:02:21.420> as<00:02:21.599> with<00:02:21.840> the<00:02:21.959> Honda<00:02:22.230> hybrids<00:02:23.269> they

00:02:24.259 --> 00:02:24.269 
fast so as with the Honda hybrids they

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:29.330 
fast so as with the Honda hybrids they
incorporate<00:02:24.930> this<00:02:25.170> blue<00:02:25.650> tint<00:02:26.069> to<00:02:26.489> the<00:02:28.340> accent

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
incorporate this blue tint to the accent

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.750 
incorporate this blue tint to the accent
there<00:02:29.900> so<00:02:30.900> now<00:02:31.079> you<00:02:31.140> have<00:02:31.409> chrome<00:02:31.860> and<00:02:31.920> a<00:02:32.549> blue

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
there so now you have chrome and a blue

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.569 
there so now you have chrome and a blue
tinted<00:02:33.239> sort<00:02:33.900> of<00:02:33.989> Chrome<00:02:34.260> there<00:02:34.530> which<00:02:35.040> you<00:02:35.069> do

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:35.579 
tinted sort of Chrome there which you do

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:42.229 
tinted sort of Chrome there which you do
not<00:02:35.609> have<00:02:36.200> on<00:02:37.340> the<00:02:38.340> DX<00:02:39.120> Civic<00:02:40.909> one<00:02:41.909> last

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 
not have on the DX Civic one last

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
material and the e^x does as well check

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.520

out<00:03:25.440> the<00:03:25.709> rear<00:03:27.019> capacity<00:03:28.019> one<00:03:28.199> thing<00:03:28.410> that

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
out the rear capacity one thing that

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:31.129 
out the rear capacity one thing that
people<00:03:28.650> don't<00:03:29.040> like<00:03:29.220> sometimes<00:03:29.910> is<00:03:30.299> that<00:03:30.930> this

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:31.139 
people don't like sometimes is that this

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:32.809

seats<00:03:31.470> don't<00:03:31.739> fold<00:03:31.859> forward<00:03:32.400> because<00:03:32.639> the

00:03:32.809 --> 00:03:32.819 
seats don't fold forward because the

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:37.610 
seats don't fold forward because the
battery<00:03:33.150> is<00:03:33.329> there<00:03:34.160> so<00:03:35.750> if<00:03:36.750> we<00:03:36.930> unlock<00:03:37.410> the

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
battery is there so if we unlock the

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:42.680 
battery is there so if we unlock the
trunk<00:03:40.250> there<00:03:41.250> is<00:03:41.430> no<00:03:41.699> way<00:03:42.000> to<00:03:42.060> move<00:03:42.269> it<00:03:42.389> forward

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
trunk there is no way to move it forward

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:47.930 
trunk there is no way to move it forward
since<00:03:43.019> the<00:03:43.169> battery<00:03:43.500> is<00:03:43.739> here<00:03:46.489> that's<00:03:47.489> a<00:03:47.609> small

since the battery is here that's a small

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.990 
since the battery is here that's a small

like<00:05:28.419> an<00:05:28.570> e<00:05:28.810> x<00:05:29.280> -<00:05:30.280> the<00:05:30.310> sunroof<00:05:31.000> you<00:05:31.180> don't<00:05:31.360> get

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:31.450 
like an e x - the sunroof you don't get

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:35.219 
like an e x - the sunroof you don't get
a<00:05:31.510> sunroof<00:05:31.990> in<00:05:32.110> this<00:05:33.510> but<00:05:34.510> it's<00:05:34.660> built<00:05:34.900> like<00:05:34.990> an

00:05:35.219 --> 00:05:35.229 
a sunroof in this but it's built like an

00:05:35.229 --> 00:05:37.040 
a sunroof in this but it's built like an
e<00:05:35.320> X<00:05:35.500> in<00:05:35.770> the<00:05:36.010> sense<00:05:36.250> that<00:05:36.340> it<00:05:36.550> does<00:05:36.760> have

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:37.050 
e X in the sense that it does have

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:42.210 
e X in the sense that it does have
automatic<00:05:38.050> temperature<00:05:40.590> this<00:05:41.590> does<00:05:41.860> have<00:05:42.070> the

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:42.220 
automatic temperature this does have the

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:45.629 
automatic temperature this does have the
back<00:05:42.370> up<00:05:42.580> camera<00:05:42.610> as<00:05:43.150> you<00:05:43.479> can<00:05:43.630> see<00:05:44.639> with

00:05:45.629 --> 00:05:45.639 
back up camera as you can see with

00:05:45.639 --> 00:05:50.010 
back up camera as you can see with
predictive<00:05:46.120> guidelines<00:05:48.599> so<00:05:49.599> those<00:05:49.750> are<00:05:49.960> the

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:50.020 
predictive guidelines so those are the

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:51.600 
predictive guidelines so those are the
main<00:05:50.200> differences<00:05:50.710> I<00:05:50.770> did<00:05:51.039> show<00:05:51.220> you<00:05:51.250> the<00:05:51.490> outs

exterior differences and I did talk a

exterior differences and I did talk a
little<00:05:55.210> bit<00:05:55.389> about<00:05:55.419> how<00:05:55.840> you<00:05:55.900> can<00:05:56.050> get<00:05:56.200> 44
