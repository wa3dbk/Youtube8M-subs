I<00:00:31.199> don't<00:00:31.560> work<00:00:31.710> it<00:00:32.120> all<00:00:33.120> like<00:00:33.420> that<00:00:33.600> somewhere

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
I don't work it all like that somewhere

near<00:00:34.350> the<00:00:34.440> beginning<00:00:34.559> of<00:00:34.770> the<00:00:34.829> course<00:00:35.100> put<00:00:35.370> his

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
near the beginning of the course put his

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.190 
near the beginning of the course put his
bike<00:00:35.640> out<00:00:35.880> of<00:00:36.030> line<00:00:36.270> and<00:00:36.600> consequently<00:00:37.020> made<00:00:37.170> a

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
bike out of line and consequently made a

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.729 
bike out of line and consequently made a
message<00:00:37.500> of<00:00:37.620> the<00:00:38.070> obstacle<00:00:39.440> young<00:00:40.440> Eric's

done<00:00:40.980> the<00:00:41.100> same<00:00:41.340> actually<00:00:42.270> I<00:00:42.300> was<00:00:42.420> a<00:00:42.480> bit

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
done the same actually I was a bit

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.479 
done the same actually I was a bit
surprised<00:00:43.050> he<00:00:43.230> was<00:00:43.350> in<00:00:43.500> really<00:00:44.309> good<00:00:44.430> shape

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
surprised he was in really good shape

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:50.060 
surprised he was in really good shape
for<00:00:44.879> that<00:00:44.910> whole<00:00:45.120> obstacle<00:00:48.800> he<00:00:49.800> was<00:00:49.950> the

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
for that whole obstacle he was the

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.389 
for that whole obstacle he was the
fastest<00:00:50.610> rider<00:00:51.000> incidentally<00:00:51.829> on<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:53.160> first

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
fastest rider incidentally on the first

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.369 
fastest rider incidentally on the first
leg<00:00:53.670> by<00:00:53.969> quite<00:00:54.270> a<00:00:54.300> long<00:00:54.570> way<00:00:54.719> much<00:00:54.960> faster<00:00:55.320> than

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
leg by quite a long way much faster than

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.790 
leg by quite a long way much faster than
this<00:00:55.530> brother<00:00:57.109> he's<00:00:58.109> certainly<00:00:58.350> going<00:00:58.500> fast

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
this brother he's certainly going fast

00:00:58.800 --> 00:00:59.869 
this brother he's certainly going fast
down<00:00:59.010> the<00:00:59.039> hill<00:00:59.309> I<00:00:59.340> don't<00:00:59.579> think<00:00:59.730> that's

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
down the hill I don't think that's

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.250 
down the hill I don't think that's
necessarily<00:01:00.390> a<00:01:00.539> good<00:01:00.719> idea

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
necessarily a good idea

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.780 
necessarily a good idea
no<00:01:01.680> it<00:01:01.829> isn't

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:02.790 
no it isn't

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:06.230 
no it isn't
there<00:01:03.150> he<00:01:03.300> goes<00:01:04.220> as<00:01:05.220> I<00:01:05.400> said<00:01:05.610> that<00:01:05.730> four-stroke

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
there he goes as I said that four-stroke

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.240 
there he goes as I said that four-stroke
power<00:01:06.510> should<00:01:07.260> be<00:01:07.350> able<00:01:07.410> to<00:01:07.530> get<00:01:07.620> good<00:01:07.770> grip

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
power should be able to get good grip

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.830 
power should be able to get good grip
now<00:01:08.640> he's<00:01:08.760> through<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.120> first<00:01:09.150> limbo<00:01:09.720> he's

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
now he's through the first limbo he's

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.150 
now he's through the first limbo he's
now<00:01:09.960> gonna<00:01:10.110> have<00:01:10.290> a<00:01:10.350> run<00:01:10.530> at<00:01:10.650> the<00:01:10.740> second<00:01:11.070> one

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:11.160 
now gonna have a run at the second one

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:14.050 
now gonna have a run at the second one
there's<00:01:11.430> a<00:01:11.490> cheeky<00:01:12.480> way

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:14.060 
there's a cheeky way

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.260 
there's a cheeky way
of<00:01:15.060> course<00:01:15.390> he's<00:01:15.630> moved<00:01:16.260> out<00:01:16.410> of<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:16.710> section

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:17.270 
of course he's moved out of the section

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:19.220 
of course he's moved out of the section
interesting<00:01:18.270> point<00:01:18.480> here<00:01:18.570> Jackie<00:01:18.960> put<00:01:19.110> his

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:19.230 
interesting point here Jackie put his

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:20.720 
interesting point here Jackie put his
foot<00:01:19.410> down<00:01:19.560> to<00:01:19.770> steady<00:01:20.010> himself<00:01:20.190> as<00:01:20.460> he<00:01:20.550> went

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:20.730 
foot down to steady himself as he went

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:22.670 
foot down to steady himself as he went
around<00:01:20.880> he's<00:01:21.600> come<00:01:21.840> into<00:01:22.080> the<00:01:22.320> section

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
around he's come into the section

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.340 
around he's come into the section
officially<00:01:23.100> so<00:01:23.250> that<00:01:23.640> should<00:01:23.940> come<00:01:24.120> I<00:01:24.810> think

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
officially so that should come I think

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.250 
officially so that should come I think
so<00:01:26.360> that<00:01:27.360> needs<00:01:27.570> to<00:01:27.630> be<00:01:27.720> checked<00:01:27.960> with<00:01:28.200> the

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:28.260 
so that needs to be checked with the

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.470 
so that needs to be checked with the
marshals<00:01:28.650> but<00:01:28.950> he<00:01:29.160> could<00:01:29.430> well<00:01:29.610> have<00:01:29.850> an<00:01:30.150> extra

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:30.480 
marshals but he could well have an extra

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:33.530 
marshals but he could well have an extra
penalty<00:01:30.870> there<00:01:31.760> certainly<00:01:32.760> got<00:01:32.910> one<00:01:33.060> there<00:01:33.240> in

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
penalty there certainly got one there in

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.050 
penalty there certainly got one there in
the<00:01:33.720> log<00:01:33.870> bit<00:01:34.340> definitely<00:01:35.340> one<00:01:35.760> minute

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
the log bit definitely one minute

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:42.470 
the log bit definitely one minute
possibly<00:01:36.450> one<00:01:36.600> minute<00:01:36.810> 22<00:01:37.590> AD<00:01:41.150> but<00:01:42.150> he<00:01:42.270> does

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:42.480 
possibly one minute 22 AD but he does

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:49.580 
possibly one minute 22 AD but he does
cover<00:01:42.720> the<00:01:42.870> ground<00:01:43.080> quickly<00:01:48.170> so<00:01:49.170> he<00:01:49.290> leaps

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
cover the ground quickly so he leaps

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.240 
cover the ground quickly so he leaps
into<00:01:49.890> the<00:01:50.010> arena<00:01:50.370> and<00:01:50.730> now<00:01:51.020> tackles<00:01:52.020> is<00:01:52.410> 5<00:01:52.830> log

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
into the arena and now tackles is 5 log

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:59.590 
into the arena and now tackles is 5 log
touch<00:01:55.790> looks<00:01:56.790> a<00:01:57.030> particular<00:01:57.720> can't<00:01:58.110> make<00:01:58.290> that

00:01:59.590 --> 00:01:59.600 
touch looks a particular can't make that

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.360 
touch looks a particular can't make that
certainly<00:02:00.600> it<00:02:00.780> for<00:02:01.080> penalties<00:02:01.590> now<00:02:01.770> possibly

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:02.370 
certainly it for penalties now possibly

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:05.150 
certainly it for penalties now possibly
5<00:02:02.700> it<00:02:03.630> is<00:02:03.780> so<00:02:04.050> hard<00:02:04.290> to<00:02:04.380> take<00:02:04.560> yourself<00:02:04.980> from

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:05.160 
5 it is so hard to take yourself from

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.310 
5 it is so hard to take yourself from
being<00:02:05.340> I<00:02:05.640> mean<00:02:06.120> from<00:02:06.300> falling<00:02:06.630> down<00:02:06.810> to<00:02:06.990> having
