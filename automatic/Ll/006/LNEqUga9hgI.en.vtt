a lot of power with an effortless turn
of<00:00:49.320> the<00:00:49.379> handle<00:00:49.770> so<00:00:50.250> you<00:00:50.340> know<00:00:50.430> when<00:00:50.550> you're

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
of the handle so you know when you're

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.220 
of the handle so you know when you're
really<00:00:50.879> in<00:00:50.910> a<00:00:51.059> big<00:00:51.239> fish<00:00:51.449> you'll<00:00:51.719> you'll<00:00:52.079> have

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
really in a big fish you'll you'll have

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.139 
really in a big fish you'll you'll have
a<00:00:52.260> better<00:00:52.500> advantage<00:00:52.699> they<00:00:53.699> started

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
a better advantage they started

think<00:01:10.350> is<00:01:10.590> kind<00:01:10.770> of<00:01:10.830> funny<00:01:11.040> basically<00:01:11.729> they

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
think is kind of funny basically they

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.219 
think is kind of funny basically they
did<00:01:11.939> was<00:01:12.090> overall<00:01:12.540> they<00:01:12.689> tried<00:01:12.869> to<00:01:12.990> make<00:01:13.110> this

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
did was overall they tried to make this

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.859 
did was overall they tried to make this
reel<00:01:13.439> more<00:01:13.680> rigid<00:01:14.270> they<00:01:15.270> wanted<00:01:15.540> to<00:01:15.630> get<00:01:15.810> rid

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
reel more rigid they wanted to get rid

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.780 
reel more rigid they wanted to get rid
of<00:01:16.080> the<00:01:16.350> Flex<00:01:16.710> you<00:01:16.890> know<00:01:17.040> flex<00:01:17.340> from<00:01:17.490> the<00:01:17.549> road

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
of the Flex you know flex from the road

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.570 
of the Flex you know flex from the road
or<00:01:17.970> flex<00:01:18.299> from<00:01:18.420> the<00:01:18.570> bail<00:01:18.750> this<00:01:19.680> is<00:01:19.860> a<00:01:19.890> much

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
or flex from the bail this is a much

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.910 
or flex from the bail this is a much
more<00:01:20.909> rigid<00:01:21.720> reel<00:01:22.080> they<00:01:22.259> increase<00:01:22.619> the<00:01:22.740> size

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
more rigid reel they increase the size

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.300 
more rigid reel they increase the size
the<00:01:23.159> gear<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:23.790> main<00:01:24.000> gear<00:01:24.299> inside<00:01:24.540> by<00:01:24.750> 30%<00:01:25.310> so

the gear the main gear inside by 30% so

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.120 
the gear the main gear inside by 30% so
it<00:01:26.369> can<00:01:26.520> handle<00:01:26.700> a<00:01:26.880> lot<00:01:26.939> more<00:01:27.060> pressure<00:01:28.130> it's

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
it can handle a lot more pressure it's

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.789 
it can handle a lot more pressure it's
more<00:01:29.369> powerful<00:01:30.320> everything<00:01:31.320> about<00:01:31.530> it<00:01:31.680> is

more powerful everything about it is

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.730 
more powerful everything about it is
just<00:01:31.829> improved<00:01:32.490> it's<00:01:32.790> a<00:01:33.509> you<00:01:34.049> know<00:01:34.140> 20<00:01:34.590> almost

29 pounds of drag on this on this rail

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.980 
29 pounds of drag on this on this rail
it<00:01:36.960> max<00:01:37.200> it's<00:01:37.920> going<00:01:38.130> to<00:01:38.189> hold<00:01:38.600> 225<00:01:39.600> yards<00:01:39.750> of

Japan<00:01:42.479> again<00:01:43.350> this<00:01:43.470> is<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:43.680> high<00:01:43.799> gear<00:01:44.040> ratio

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
Japan again this is the high gear ratio

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.630 
Japan again this is the high gear ratio
so<00:01:44.579> it's<00:01:44.700> a<00:01:44.790> six<00:01:45.060> point<00:01:45.299> two<00:01:45.450> to<00:01:45.600> one<00:01:46.399> 15<00:01:47.399> ball

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
so it's a six point two to one 15 ball

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.160 
so it's a six point two to one 15 ball
bearings<00:01:48.090> and<00:01:48.270> it<00:01:48.360> weighs<00:01:48.570> just<00:01:48.780> fifteen

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
bearings and it weighs just fifteen

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.749 
bearings and it weighs just fifteen
point<00:01:49.439> three<00:01:49.500> ounces<00:01:50.009> so<00:01:50.189> it's<00:01:50.340> nice<00:01:50.520> and

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
point three ounces so it's nice and

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:54.139 
point three ounces so it's nice and
light<00:01:50.960> it's<00:01:51.960> all<00:01:52.110> aluminum<00:01:52.850> they<00:01:53.850> use<00:01:54.000> some

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
light it's all aluminum they use some
