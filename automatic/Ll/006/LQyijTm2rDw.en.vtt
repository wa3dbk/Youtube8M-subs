the best tools that we have to teach you
how<00:00:22.830> to<00:00:22.859> do<00:00:23.070> that<00:00:23.220> properly<00:00:23.460> how<00:00:23.880> to<00:00:23.910> run<00:00:24.210> with

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
how to do that properly how to run with

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.990 
how to do that properly how to run with
proper<00:00:24.840> form<00:00:25.050> is<00:00:25.349> the<00:00:25.560> metronome<00:00:26.000> this

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
proper form is the metronome this

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.450 
proper form is the metronome this
metronome<00:00:27.449> is<00:00:27.599> a<00:00:27.630> great<00:00:27.900> little<00:00:28.199> tool

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:28.460 
metronome is a great little tool

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:30.950 
metronome is a great little tool
primarily<00:00:29.460> because<00:00:29.670> it's<00:00:29.939> little<00:00:30.150> and<00:00:30.390> it's

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
primarily because it's little and it's

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.260 
primarily because it's little and it's
portable<00:00:31.230> and<00:00:31.589> it<00:00:32.160> never<00:00:32.430> dies<00:00:32.610> the<00:00:32.940> battery

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
portable and it never dies the battery

portable and it never dies the battery
is<00:00:33.480> really<00:00:33.840> strong<00:00:34.020> in<00:00:34.230> it<00:00:34.350> I've<00:00:34.530> had<00:00:34.650> one<00:00:34.860> for

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
is really strong in it I've had one for

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.740 
is really strong in it I've had one for
two<00:00:35.130> years<00:00:35.400> and<00:00:35.700> the<00:00:35.760> battery<00:00:36.030> has<00:00:36.270> yet<00:00:36.480> to<00:00:36.630> die

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
two years and the battery has yet to die

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.680 
two years and the battery has yet to die
on<00:00:36.930> me<00:00:37.460> this<00:00:38.460> comes<00:00:38.640> in<00:00:38.820> three<00:00:38.850> colors<00:00:39.060> we<00:00:39.540> saw

onto our watch like that our bodies love

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.760 
onto our watch like that our bodies love
rhythm<00:01:06.030> if<00:01:06.420> you<00:01:06.600> think<00:01:06.840> about<00:01:07.049> how<00:01:07.320> you<00:01:07.380> sleep

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
rhythm if you think about how you sleep

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.219 
rhythm if you think about how you sleep
or<00:01:08.159> eat<00:01:08.460> or<00:01:08.729> breathe<00:01:08.939> those<00:01:09.539> are<00:01:09.689> all<00:01:09.810> rhythms

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
or eat or breathe those are all rhythms

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:11.600 
or eat or breathe those are all rhythms
that<00:01:10.380> we<00:01:10.560> live

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
that we live

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.000 
that we live
so<00:01:12.180> when<00:01:12.360> you<00:01:12.450> run<00:01:12.660> you<00:01:13.140> want<00:01:13.320> to<00:01:13.440> follow<00:01:13.590> over

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
so when you run you want to follow over

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.910 
so when you run you want to follow over
them<00:01:14.160> as<00:01:14.310> well<00:01:14.490> and<00:01:15.080> what<00:01:16.080> you<00:01:16.200> follow<00:01:16.530> in

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
them as well and what you follow in

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.490 
them as well and what you follow in
running<00:01:17.700> to<00:01:18.060> maintain<00:01:18.540> a<00:01:18.570> rhythm<00:01:18.960> is<00:01:19.200> your

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
running to maintain a rhythm is your

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.430 
running to maintain a rhythm is your
cadence<00:01:19.740> and<00:01:20.630> cadence<00:01:21.630> is<00:01:21.870> the<00:01:22.140> number<00:01:22.410> of

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:22.440 
cadence and cadence is the number of

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:24.800 
cadence and cadence is the number of
times<00:01:22.770> per<00:01:23.130> minute<00:01:23.430> that<00:01:23.970> your<00:01:24.090> legs<00:01:24.360> turn

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
times per minute that your legs turn

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.440 
times per minute that your legs turn
over<00:01:25.110> as<00:01:25.290> you<00:01:25.530> run<00:01:25.710> down<00:01:25.890> the<00:01:25.920> road<00:01:26.070> a<00:01:26.520> lot<00:01:27.300> of

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
over as you run down the road a lot of

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.060 
over as you run down the road a lot of
runners<00:01:27.750> tend<00:01:28.020> to<00:01:28.200> take<00:01:28.380> too<00:01:28.620> long<00:01:28.650> of<00:01:29.010> a

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
runners tend to take too long of a

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.620 
runners tend to take too long of a
stride<00:01:29.310> when<00:01:29.550> they<00:01:29.670> run<00:01:29.910> which<00:01:30.480> is

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
stride when they run which is

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.170 
stride when they run which is
inefficient<00:01:30.900> and<00:01:31.350> can<00:01:31.620> cause<00:01:31.800> injury<00:01:32.120> as<00:01:33.120> a

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
inefficient and can cause injury as a

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.850 
inefficient and can cause injury as a
runner<00:01:33.540> there<00:01:33.930> are<00:01:34.050> two<00:01:34.260> things<00:01:34.470> that<00:01:34.770> you

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
runner there are two things that you

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.230 
runner there are two things that you
want<00:01:35.040> to<00:01:35.100> pay<00:01:35.220> attention<00:01:35.610> to<00:01:35.730> when<00:01:35.880> you<00:01:35.970> run

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
want to pay attention to when you run

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.020 
want to pay attention to when you run
one<00:01:36.990> is<00:01:37.230> energy<00:01:37.590> efficiency<00:01:37.980> and<00:01:38.340> two<00:01:38.730> is

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
one is energy efficiency and two is

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.270 
one is energy efficiency and two is
injury<00:01:39.360> prevention<00:01:39.720> the<00:01:40.680> best<00:01:40.980> way<00:01:41.250> to

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
injury prevention the best way to

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.330 
injury prevention the best way to
maintain<00:01:41.790> both<00:01:42.480> of<00:01:42.660> those<00:01:42.780> is<00:01:43.110> by<00:01:43.320> focusing<00:01:44.220> on

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
maintain both of those is by focusing on

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.340 
maintain both of those is by focusing on
your<00:01:44.400> cadence<00:01:44.700> and<00:01:45.090> using<00:01:45.510> an<00:01:45.630> ideal<00:01:45.900> cadence

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
your cadence and using an ideal cadence

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.670 
your cadence and using an ideal cadence
as<00:01:46.500> you<00:01:46.740> run<00:01:46.980> and<00:01:47.460> she<00:01:48.450> running<00:01:48.810> we<00:01:49.140> teach<00:01:49.380> that

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
as you run and she running we teach that

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.890 
as you run and she running we teach that
the<00:01:49.830> ideal<00:01:50.100> cadence<00:01:50.550> is<00:01:50.790> between<00:01:51.120> 85<00:01:51.660> and<00:01:51.690> 90

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:51.900 
the ideal cadence is between 85 and 90

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:56.630 
the ideal cadence is between 85 and 90
steps<00:01:52.530> per<00:01:52.770> minute<00:01:52.920> with<00:01:53.910> one<00:01:54.060> leg<00:01:54.300> or<00:01:55.220> 170<00:01:56.220> to

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
steps per minute with one leg or 170 to

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.240 
steps per minute with one leg or 170 to
180<00:01:57.150> steps<00:01:57.570> per<00:01:57.780> minute<00:01:57.990> with<00:01:58.140> both<00:01:58.350> legs<00:01:58.650> so

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
180 steps per minute with both legs so

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.180 
180 steps per minute with both legs so
what<00:01:59.670> that<00:01:59.790> means<00:02:00.030> is<00:02:00.360> that<00:02:00.390> your<00:02:00.780> legs

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:01.190 
what that means is that your legs

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:03.800 
what that means is that your legs
combined<00:02:02.190> are<00:02:02.550> turning<00:02:02.850> over<00:02:02.940> in<00:02:03.450> one<00:02:03.630> minute

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
combined are turning over in one minute

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.400 
combined are turning over in one minute
between<00:02:04.140> 170<00:02:05.040> and<00:02:05.070> 180<00:02:05.729> times<00:02:06.229> for<00:02:07.229> taller

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:07.410 
between 170 and 180 times for taller

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:10.580 
between 170 and 180 times for taller
people<00:02:07.620> it'll<00:02:08.340> be<00:02:08.429> closer<00:02:09.290> 274<00:02:10.290> shorter

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
people it'll be closer 274 shorter

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.510 
people it'll be closer 274 shorter
people<00:02:10.770> you're<00:02:11.160> up<00:02:11.280> closer<00:02:11.550> to<00:02:11.700> the<00:02:11.850> 180<00:02:12.450> range

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520 
people you're up closer to the 180 range

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.890 
people you're up closer to the 180 range
the<00:02:14.520> reason<00:02:14.880> that<00:02:14.970> this<00:02:15.120> is<00:02:15.270> important<00:02:15.750> is

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
the reason that this is important is

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.140 
the reason that this is important is
that<00:02:16.410> as<00:02:16.920> you're<00:02:17.430> running<00:02:17.730> down<00:02:17.760> the<00:02:18.000> road

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
that as you're running down the road

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.930 
that as you're running down the road
every<00:02:18.780> step<00:02:19.080> that<00:02:19.110> you<00:02:19.380> take<00:02:19.410> requires<00:02:20.190> that

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
every step that you take requires that

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.510 
every step that you take requires that
your<00:02:21.090> leg<00:02:21.390> support<00:02:22.170> your<00:02:22.290> body<00:02:22.440> weight<00:02:22.560> if<00:02:23.310> you

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
your leg support your body weight if you

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.699 
your leg support your body weight if you
turn<00:02:23.760> over<00:02:24.060> faster<00:02:24.540> the<00:02:25.020> total<00:02:25.410> amount<00:02:25.620> of

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
turn over faster the total amount of

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:28.430 
turn over faster the total amount of
time<00:02:25.980> for<00:02:26.610> each<00:02:26.790> stride<00:02:27.180> that<00:02:27.780> your<00:02:27.930> leg<00:02:28.140> has

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
time for each stride that your leg has

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.350 
time for each stride that your leg has
to<00:02:28.590> hold<00:02:28.739> up<00:02:28.860> your<00:02:28.890> body<00:02:29.190> weight<00:02:29.430> is<00:02:29.820> much<00:02:30.090> more

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
to hold up your body weight is much more

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.449 
to hold up your body weight is much more
efficient<00:02:30.810> it<00:02:30.989> could<00:02:31.110> turn<00:02:31.230> over<00:02:31.500> faster<00:02:31.950> than

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
efficient it could turn over faster than

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:34.520 
efficient it could turn over faster than
if<00:02:32.610> you<00:02:32.730> take<00:02:32.970> long<00:02:33.209> strides<00:02:33.540> and<00:02:33.989> spend<00:02:34.290> a<00:02:34.350> lot

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
if you take long strides and spend a lot

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.090 
if you take long strides and spend a lot
of<00:02:34.560> time<00:02:34.890> on<00:02:35.220> your<00:02:35.790> leg<00:02:35.970> with<00:02:36.330> each<00:02:36.450> stride

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:37.100 
of time on your leg with each stride

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:39.590 
of time on your leg with each stride
what<00:02:38.100> I'm<00:02:38.220> going<00:02:38.340> to<00:02:38.430> do<00:02:38.520> next<00:02:38.700> show<00:02:39.270> you<00:02:39.330> all

out<00:02:46.080> for<00:02:46.110> a<00:02:46.350> run<00:02:46.550> the<00:02:47.550> first<00:02:47.760> thing<00:02:47.880> I'm<00:02:48.000> going

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
out for a run the first thing I'm going

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.420 
out for a run the first thing I'm going
to<00:02:48.180> do<00:02:48.360> is<00:02:48.690> turn<00:02:48.900> it<00:02:48.959> on<00:02:49.140> which<00:02:49.830> is<00:02:49.920> up<00:02:50.070> here<00:02:50.310> in

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
to do is turn it on which is up here in

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:56.410 
to do is turn it on which is up here in
this<00:02:50.519> corner<00:02:50.790> so<00:02:51.739> right<00:02:52.739> now<00:02:53.720> it's<00:02:54.720> at<00:02:54.900> an<00:02:55.019> 85

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420 
this corner so right now it's at an 85

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:59.900 
this corner so right now it's at an 85
tempo<00:02:57.420> and<00:02:57.690> the<00:02:58.320> volume<00:02:58.709> is<00:02:58.980> at<00:02:59.610> the<00:02:59.730> lowest

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
tempo and the volume is at the lowest

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:02.360 
tempo and the volume is at the lowest
level<00:03:00.360> there's<00:03:01.200> also<00:03:01.410> a<00:03:01.530> mute<00:03:01.800> level<00:03:02.160> and

level there's also a mute level and
several<00:03:02.820> volumes<00:03:03.120> louder<00:03:03.950> if<00:03:04.950> I<00:03:05.040> wanted<00:03:05.280> to

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
several volumes louder if I wanted to

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:06.830 
several volumes louder if I wanted to
change<00:03:05.580> the<00:03:05.790> volume<00:03:05.910> I<00:03:06.330> would<00:03:06.510> click<00:03:06.690> the

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
change the volume I would click the

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.350 
change the volume I would click the

select button until the cursor moved
over<00:03:09.720> to<00:03:09.900> the<00:03:09.989> volume<00:03:10.350> tab<00:03:10.620> and<00:03:10.950> then<00:03:11.459> I<00:03:11.550> could

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
over to the volume tab and then I could

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:13.670 
over to the volume tab and then I could
click<00:03:11.880> up<00:03:12.060> or<00:03:12.209> down<00:03:12.360> to<00:03:12.750> make<00:03:12.870> it<00:03:12.989> louder<00:03:13.200> or

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
click up or down to make it louder or

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.550 
click up or down to make it louder or
quieter<00:03:14.510> the<00:03:15.510> other<00:03:15.630> setting<00:03:16.019> on<00:03:16.140> here<00:03:16.380> is<00:03:16.440> the

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
quieter the other setting on here is the

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:17.540 
quieter the other setting on here is the
beat<00:03:16.739> the<00:03:16.980> one<00:03:17.130> in<00:03:17.220> the<00:03:17.280> middle

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:17.550 
beat the one in the middle

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:20.210 
beat the one in the middle
so<00:03:18.360> I<00:03:18.390> would<00:03:18.600> click<00:03:18.720> the<00:03:18.959> select<00:03:19.230> button<00:03:19.319> to

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
so I would click the select button to

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:21.080 
so I would click the select button to
get<00:03:20.370> to<00:03:20.520> the<00:03:20.640> beat

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
get to the beat

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.600 
get to the beat
we<00:03:21.930> recommend<00:03:22.260> that<00:03:22.500> you<00:03:22.650> use<00:03:22.680> the<00:03:23.160> beep

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:23.610 
we recommend that you use the beep

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:26.180 
we recommend that you use the beep
labeled<00:03:24.330> zero<00:03:24.420> there's<00:03:25.290> a<00:03:25.380> lot<00:03:25.620> of<00:03:25.770> beats<00:03:25.980> and

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
labeled zero there's a lot of beats and

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:28.070 
labeled zero there's a lot of beats and
those<00:03:26.430> are<00:03:26.610> more<00:03:26.760> complicated<00:03:27.090> and<00:03:27.599> generally

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:28.080 
those are more complicated and generally

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:30.020 
those are more complicated and generally
for<00:03:28.110> musicians<00:03:28.739> but<00:03:29.040> for<00:03:29.220> a<00:03:29.250> runner<00:03:29.520> all<00:03:29.849> you

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
for musicians but for a runner all you

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:33.589 
for musicians but for a runner all you
need<00:03:30.209> is<00:03:30.330> zero<00:03:31.310> the<00:03:32.310> next<00:03:32.459> most<00:03:32.849> important<00:03:33.420> tab

00:03:33.589 --> 00:03:33.599 
need is zero the next most important tab

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:35.750 
need is zero the next most important tab
is<00:03:33.870> the<00:03:34.020> tempo<00:03:34.319> that's<00:03:34.770> the<00:03:34.950> one<00:03:35.099> over<00:03:35.220> here<00:03:35.580> so

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
is the tempo that's the one over here so

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.930 
is the tempo that's the one over here so
what<00:03:36.450> I'm<00:03:36.540> going<00:03:36.630> to<00:03:36.720> do<00:03:36.900> is<00:03:37.560> change<00:03:37.950> this<00:03:38.220> so

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
what I'm going to do is change this so

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:41.809 
what I'm going to do is change this so
that<00:03:39.120> it<00:03:39.209> reads<00:03:40.050> on<00:03:40.380> the<00:03:40.530> tempo<00:03:40.890> the<00:03:41.130> little

00:03:41.809 --> 00:03:41.819 
that it reads on the tempo the little

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:44.809 
that it reads on the tempo the little
cursor<00:03:42.180> is<00:03:42.390> on<00:03:42.510> the<00:03:42.660> tempo<00:03:42.989> line<00:03:43.519> and<00:03:44.519> I'm<00:03:44.670> just

00:03:44.809 --> 00:03:44.819 
cursor is on the tempo line and I'm just

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:46.430 
cursor is on the tempo line and I'm just
going<00:03:44.970> to<00:03:45.060> move<00:03:45.239> this<00:03:45.420> up<00:03:45.630> so<00:03:45.690> you<00:03:45.989> can<00:03:46.200> hear

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:46.440 
going to move this up so you can hear

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:55.280 
going to move this up so you can hear
what<00:03:46.590> it's<00:03:46.709> like<00:03:48.500> at<00:03:49.500> a<00:03:49.560> 90<00:03:50.010> cadence<00:03:54.290> 93

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
what it's like at a 90 cadence 93

00:03:55.290 --> 00:04:05.120 
what it's like at a 90 cadence 93
cadence<00:04:01.100> back<00:04:02.100> to<00:04:02.280> 85<00:04:03.319> so<00:04:04.319> remember<00:04:04.769> that<00:04:04.799> in

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:05.130 
cadence back to 85 so remember that in

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:08.180 
cadence back to 85 so remember that in
she<00:04:05.310> running<00:04:05.610> we<00:04:06.000> teach<00:04:06.239> an<00:04:06.450> 85<00:04:06.989> to<00:04:07.290> 90<00:04:07.650> cadence

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:08.190 
she running we teach an 85 to 90 cadence

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:11.030 
she running we teach an 85 to 90 cadence
which<00:04:08.519> means<00:04:08.790> 85<00:04:09.330> steps<00:04:09.930> per<00:04:10.230> minute<00:04:10.380> one<00:04:10.830> leg

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040 
which means 85 steps per minute one leg

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:13.670 
which means 85 steps per minute one leg
up<00:04:11.400> to<00:04:12.030> 90<00:04:12.360> steps<00:04:12.630> per<00:04:12.810> minute<00:04:12.930> for<00:04:13.440> taller

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 
up to 90 steps per minute for taller

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:16.479 
up to 90 steps per minute for taller
people<00:04:13.769> is<00:04:14.250> 85<00:04:14.700> for<00:04:15.090> shorter<00:04:15.390> people<00:04:15.569> it's<00:04:15.840> 90

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:16.489 
people is 85 for shorter people it's 90

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:19.340 
people is 85 for shorter people it's 90
ok<00:04:17.489> in<00:04:17.729> this<00:04:18.120> next<00:04:18.180> segment<00:04:18.870> I'm<00:04:19.049> going<00:04:19.260> to

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:19.350 
ok in this next segment I'm going to

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:21.199 
ok in this next segment I'm going to
show<00:04:19.410> you<00:04:19.620> how<00:04:19.919> to<00:04:19.979> match<00:04:20.160> your<00:04:20.370> arm<00:04:20.579> swing<00:04:20.820> to

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:21.209 
show you how to match your arm swing to

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:23.210 
show you how to match your arm swing to
the<00:04:21.239> cadence<00:04:21.660> of<00:04:21.780> the<00:04:21.870> national<00:04:22.260> right<00:04:23.040> now<00:04:23.190> I

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:23.220 
the cadence of the national right now I

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:25.909 
the cadence of the national right now I
have<00:04:23.520> this<00:04:23.639> metronome<00:04:24.150> set<00:04:24.510> at<00:04:24.750> 85<00:04:25.169> beats<00:04:25.650> per

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:25.919 
have this metronome set at 85 beats per

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:28.880 
have this metronome set at 85 beats per
minute<00:04:26.190> at<00:04:27.180> the<00:04:27.510> lot<00:04:27.690> at<00:04:27.960> the<00:04:28.110> loudest<00:04:28.500> volume

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:28.890 
minute at the lot at the loudest volume

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:31.550 
minute at the lot at the loudest volume
and<00:04:29.300> when<00:04:30.300> I<00:04:30.330> turn<00:04:30.539> it<00:04:30.570> on<00:04:30.750> what<00:04:31.080> I<00:04:31.110> want<00:04:31.320> you<00:04:31.440> to

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:31.560 
and when I turn it on what I want you to

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:33.980 
and when I turn it on what I want you to
see<00:04:31.770> is<00:04:32.039> that<00:04:32.280> every<00:04:32.640> time<00:04:32.820> my<00:04:33.150> right<00:04:33.419> arm<00:04:33.690> is

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:33.990 
see is that every time my right arm is

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:37.580 
see is that every time my right arm is
at<00:04:34.320> the<00:04:34.440> end<00:04:34.650> of<00:04:34.890> its<00:04:35.039> swing<00:04:35.370> to<00:04:35.640> the<00:04:35.760> rear<00:04:36.590> it

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:37.590 
at the end of its swing to the rear it

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:39.860 
at the end of its swing to the rear it
will<00:04:37.830> match<00:04:38.010> the<00:04:38.280> beep<00:04:38.460> of<00:04:38.610> the<00:04:38.700> metronome<00:04:39.060> so

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:39.870 
will match the beep of the metronome so

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:42.350 
will match the beep of the metronome so
remember<00:04:40.260> that<00:04:40.289> 85<00:04:40.860> beats<00:04:41.580> per<00:04:41.850> minute<00:04:42.120> means

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:42.360 
remember that 85 beats per minute means

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:44.690 
remember that 85 beats per minute means
one<00:04:42.660> side<00:04:42.690> of<00:04:43.080> your<00:04:43.169> body<00:04:43.320> is<00:04:43.740> turning<00:04:44.490> over<00:04:44.580> a

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:44.700 
one side of your body is turning over a

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:46.790 
one side of your body is turning over a
certain<00:04:45.030> number<00:04:45.090> of<00:04:45.270> times<00:04:45.590> I'm<00:04:46.590> going<00:04:46.740> to

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:46.800 
certain number of times I'm going to

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:48.170 
certain number of times I'm going to
turn<00:04:46.890> this<00:04:47.010> on<00:04:47.160> and<00:04:47.400> I<00:04:47.430> want<00:04:47.610> you<00:04:47.729> to<00:04:47.760> watch<00:04:47.970> my

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:48.180 
turn this on and I want you to watch my

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:50.570 
turn this on and I want you to watch my
elbow<00:04:48.479> and<00:04:48.690> see<00:04:49.470> how<00:04:49.620> it<00:04:49.740> matches<00:04:49.889> the<00:04:50.250> beep<00:04:50.430> of

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:50.580 
elbow and see how it matches the beep of

00:04:50.580 --> 00:05:06.380 
elbow and see how it matches the beep of
the<00:04:50.669> metronome

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:06.390 

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:08.730 

okay<00:05:07.390> so<00:05:07.930> I<00:05:07.960> know<00:05:08.080> that<00:05:08.290> might<00:05:08.440> seem<00:05:08.620> a<00:05:08.680> little

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:08.740 
okay so I know that might seem a little

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:11.220 
okay so I know that might seem a little
strange<00:05:09.040> to<00:05:09.580> have<00:05:09.700> my<00:05:09.940> arms<00:05:10.330> moving<00:05:10.690> to<00:05:11.140> the

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:11.230 
strange to have my arms moving to the

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:13.350 
strange to have my arms moving to the
beat<00:05:11.410> but<00:05:11.950> your<00:05:12.280> arms<00:05:12.550> and<00:05:12.760> your<00:05:12.880> legs<00:05:12.910> will

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:13.360 
beat but your arms and your legs will

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:14.910 
beat but your arms and your legs will
always<00:05:13.600> move<00:05:13.810> at<00:05:13.930> the<00:05:14.050> same<00:05:14.230> cadence<00:05:14.470> and

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:14.920 
always move at the same cadence and

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:16.800 
always move at the same cadence and
sometimes<00:05:15.310> it's<00:05:15.550> easier<00:05:15.910> especially<00:05:16.750> if

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:16.810 
sometimes it's easier especially if

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:18.090 
sometimes it's easier especially if
you're<00:05:16.930> not<00:05:17.050> used<00:05:17.290> to<00:05:17.500> this<00:05:17.620> quick<00:05:17.890> of<00:05:18.040> a

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:18.100 
you're not used to this quick of a

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:20.460 
you're not used to this quick of a
cadence<00:05:18.340> to<00:05:19.000> move<00:05:19.180> your<00:05:19.330> arms<00:05:19.660> first<00:05:19.960> and<00:05:20.260> your

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:20.470 
cadence to move your arms first and your

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:22.830 
cadence to move your arms first and your
legs<00:05:20.680> will<00:05:20.890> fall<00:05:21.070> so<00:05:21.940> I<00:05:22.000> promise<00:05:22.390> if<00:05:22.540> you<00:05:22.630> use

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:22.840 
legs will fall so I promise if you use

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:24.240 
legs will fall so I promise if you use
one<00:05:23.020> of<00:05:23.050> these<00:05:23.170> metronomes<00:05:23.500> you<00:05:23.830> will<00:05:23.950> become

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:24.250 
one of these metronomes you will become

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:26.600 
one of these metronomes you will become
a<00:05:24.280> more<00:05:24.490> efficient<00:05:24.940> and<00:05:25.120> injury-free<00:05:25.600> runner

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:26.610
