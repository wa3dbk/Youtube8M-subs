00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
class has been asking probably won't be

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.280 
class has been asking probably won't be
the<00:00:08.910> greatest<00:00:09.120> quality<00:00:09.599> video<00:00:09.840> because<00:00:10.139> I'm

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
the greatest quality video because I'm

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.740 
the greatest quality video because I'm
looking<00:00:11.040> down<00:00:11.190> at<00:00:11.370> my<00:00:11.460> feet<00:00:11.639> but<00:00:12.450> this<00:00:12.599> will<00:00:12.719> be

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
looking down at my feet but this will be

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.240 
looking down at my feet but this will be
the<00:00:12.870> best<00:00:13.110> way<00:00:13.230> to<00:00:13.259> do<00:00:13.469> it<00:00:13.590> is<00:00:13.679> to<00:00:13.830> sit<00:00:14.040> in<00:00:14.130> a

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
the best way to do it is to sit in a

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.000 
the best way to do it is to sit in a
chair<00:00:14.280> and<00:00:14.870> just<00:00:15.870> to<00:00:15.990> practice<00:00:16.170> the<00:00:16.529> motion<00:00:16.890> of

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
chair and just to practice the motion of

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:18.710 
chair and just to practice the motion of
it<00:00:17.160> and<00:00:17.340> then<00:00:17.460> it<00:00:17.699> eventually<00:00:17.970> come<00:00:18.359> it<00:00:18.600> is<00:00:18.690> a

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
it and then it eventually come it is a

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.109 
it and then it eventually come it is a
tough<00:00:19.020> step<00:00:19.289> but<00:00:20.070> once<00:00:20.250> you<00:00:20.400> have<00:00:20.609> it<00:00:20.820> your

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
tough step but once you have it your

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.540 
tough step but once you have it your
brain<00:00:21.359> will<00:00:21.570> just<00:00:21.600> be<00:00:21.869> able<00:00:21.990> to<00:00:22.140> do<00:00:22.410> it<00:00:22.560> so<00:00:23.400> I'm

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
brain will just be able to do it so I'm

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.689 
brain will just be able to do it so I'm
sitting<00:00:23.910> here<00:00:24.119> I<00:00:24.180> have<00:00:24.539> weight<00:00:25.019> on<00:00:25.170> both<00:00:25.199> feet

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:25.699 
sitting here I have weight on both feet

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:28.189 
sitting here I have weight on both feet
the<00:00:26.699> basic<00:00:27.090> motion<00:00:27.449> of<00:00:27.570> Applejack's

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
the basic motion of Applejack's

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.040 
the basic motion of Applejack's
is<00:00:28.619> to<00:00:28.859> take<00:00:29.070> one<00:00:29.429> toe<00:00:29.699> out<00:00:29.939> to<00:00:30.269> the<00:00:30.390> side<00:00:30.660> as

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
is to take one toe out to the side as

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.160 
is to take one toe out to the side as
the<00:00:31.859> other<00:00:31.890> heel<00:00:32.550> comes<00:00:33.120> in<00:00:33.420> to<00:00:33.540> the<00:00:33.630> instep

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
the other heel comes in to the instep

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.819 
the other heel comes in to the instep
and<00:00:34.640> bring<00:00:35.640> them<00:00:35.820> back<00:00:35.969> together<00:00:36.270> and<00:00:37.140> if<00:00:37.739> I

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
and bring them back together and if I

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.740 
and bring them back together and if I
was<00:00:37.980> going<00:00:38.160> to<00:00:38.250> do<00:00:38.399> one<00:00:38.610> to<00:00:38.790> the<00:00:38.910> right<00:00:39.090> the

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
was going to do one to the right the

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.229 
was going to do one to the right the
right<00:00:40.020> toe<00:00:40.320> would<00:00:40.530> be<00:00:40.649> going<00:00:40.860> out<00:00:41.160> and<00:00:41.489> the

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
right toe would be going out and the

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.510 
right toe would be going out and the
left<00:00:42.540> heel<00:00:42.809> swivels<00:00:43.320> in<00:00:43.500> towards<00:00:43.860> the<00:00:44.010> instep

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
left heel swivels in towards the instep

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.569 
left heel swivels in towards the instep
so<00:00:45.450> what's<00:00:45.660> happening<00:00:46.230> is<00:00:46.410> one<00:00:46.710> toe<00:00:46.980> is<00:00:47.219> going

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
so what's happening is one toe is going

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:55.420 
so what's happening is one toe is going
out<00:00:47.789> as<00:00:48.500> the<00:00:49.500> other<00:00:49.739> heel<00:00:50.399> is<00:00:51.050> swiveling<00:00:52.050> in<00:00:52.260> oh

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:55.430 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:00.410 

yeah<00:00:56.489> boom<00:00:57.480> what<00:00:58.079> makes<00:00:58.320> this<00:00:58.530> happen<00:00:59.160> is<00:00:59.430> the

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
yeah boom what makes this happen is the

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.619 
yeah boom what makes this happen is the
weight<00:01:00.570> changes<00:01:01.079> so<00:01:01.739> as<00:01:01.920> I<00:01:01.949> start<00:01:02.879> to<00:01:03.120> swivel

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
weight changes so as I start to swivel

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.899 
weight changes so as I start to swivel
the<00:01:04.229> weight<00:01:04.500> is<00:01:04.680> going<00:01:04.739> on<00:01:05.100> to<00:01:05.250> the<00:01:05.369> heel<00:01:05.700> of<00:01:05.880> my
