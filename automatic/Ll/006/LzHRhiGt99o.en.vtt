in<00:00:01.020> this<00:00:01.170> video<00:00:01.530> we'll<00:00:01.770> look<00:00:01.800> at<00:00:02.040> a<00:00:02.100> nice

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:02.370 
in this video we'll look at a nice

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:04.610 
in this video we'll look at a nice
method<00:00:02.700> to<00:00:03.060> use<00:00:03.210> Excel<00:00:03.689> to<00:00:04.020> test<00:00:04.259> whether<00:00:04.470> a

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:04.620 
method to use Excel to test whether a

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.190 
method to use Excel to test whether a
number<00:00:04.830> is<00:00:05.009> prime<00:00:05.390> this<00:00:06.390> method<00:00:06.839> works<00:00:07.049> for

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
number is prime this method works for

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.080 
number is prime this method works for
the<00:00:07.470> types<00:00:07.710> of<00:00:07.919> problems<00:00:08.309> that<00:00:08.490> we<00:00:08.639> might<00:00:08.820> ask

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
the types of problems that we might ask

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.919 
the types of problems that we might ask
students<00:00:09.599> to<00:00:09.840> solve<00:00:10.019> using<00:00:10.320> a<00:00:10.559> calculator<00:00:11.929> so

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
students to solve using a calculator so

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:14.870 
students to solve using a calculator so
the<00:00:13.049> question<00:00:13.469> that<00:00:13.500> we're<00:00:14.219> going<00:00:14.400> to<00:00:14.519> look<00:00:14.639> at

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
the question that we're going to look at

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.260 
the question that we're going to look at
is<00:00:15.120> to<00:00:15.150> find<00:00:15.870> a<00:00:16.109> prime<00:00:16.609> that's<00:00:17.609> greater<00:00:18.000> than<00:00:18.240> a

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
is to find a prime that's greater than a

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.240 
is to find a prime that's greater than a
thousand<00:00:18.840> actually<00:00:19.470> to<00:00:19.590> find<00:00:19.800> the<00:00:19.920> smallest

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
thousand actually to find the smallest

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.700 
thousand actually to find the smallest
prime<00:00:20.670> that's<00:00:20.820> greater<00:00:21.119> than<00:00:21.210> a<00:00:21.449> thousand<00:00:21.900> so

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
prime that's greater than a thousand so

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.160 
prime that's greater than a thousand so
what<00:00:22.859> I'm<00:00:22.949> gonna<00:00:23.100> do<00:00:23.340> on<00:00:23.369> the<00:00:23.760> Left<00:00:24.119> is<00:00:24.510> going

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
what I'm gonna do on the Left is going

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.640 
what I'm gonna do on the Left is going
to<00:00:25.320> be<00:00:25.529> the<00:00:25.800> divisors<00:00:26.789> that<00:00:27.150> we<00:00:27.269> check

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:30.650 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:36.020 

potential<00:00:31.650> divisors<00:00:32.930> okay<00:00:33.930> and<00:00:34.880> I'm<00:00:35.880> not

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
potential divisors okay and I'm not

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.090 
potential divisors okay and I'm not
gonna<00:00:36.180> check<00:00:36.510> one<00:00:36.870> or<00:00:37.079> two<00:00:37.320> because<00:00:37.649> those<00:00:37.950> are

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
gonna check one or two because those are

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.470 
gonna check one or two because those are
pretty<00:00:38.280> obvious<00:00:38.489> from<00:00:38.850> looking<00:00:38.940> at<00:00:39.329> the

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
pretty obvious from looking at the

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.660 
pretty obvious from looking at the
number<00:00:39.809> so<00:00:40.079> let's<00:00:40.440> just<00:00:40.800> start<00:00:41.040> with<00:00:41.219> three

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
number so let's just start with three

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.740 
number so let's just start with three
and<00:00:42.590> we<00:00:43.590> will<00:00:43.620> check<00:00:44.309> all<00:00:44.820> the<00:00:45.180> odds<00:00:45.360> because

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
and we will check all the odds because

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.010 
and we will check all the odds because
we<00:00:45.989> don't<00:00:46.170> need<00:00:46.230> to<00:00:46.379> check<00:00:46.620> the<00:00:46.770> evens<00:00:47.780> and<00:00:48.780> I'm

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
we don't need to check the evens and I'm

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.950 
we don't need to check the evens and I'm
gonna<00:00:49.140> make<00:00:49.680> this<00:00:49.950> go<00:00:50.879> down<00:00:51.090> way<00:00:51.420> past<00:00:51.719> the

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
gonna make this go down way past the

00:00:51.960 --> 00:01:02.900 
gonna make this go down way past the
screen<00:00:56.300> okay<00:00:57.300> and<00:00:59.629> here<00:01:00.629> I<00:01:00.899> will<00:01:01.640> click<00:01:02.640> the

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
screen okay and here I will click the

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.460 
screen okay and here I will click the
caution<00:01:03.530> we<00:01:04.530> divide<00:01:05.479> okay<00:01:06.479> and<00:01:06.689> I'm<00:01:06.840> trying<00:01:07.260> to

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
caution we divide okay and I'm trying to

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.250 
caution we divide okay and I'm trying to
find<00:01:07.740> the<00:01:08.610> greatest<00:01:08.850> prime<00:01:09.299> I<00:01:09.630> mean<00:01:10.110> the

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
find the greatest prime I mean the

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:11.600 
find the greatest prime I mean the
smallest<00:01:10.680> prime<00:01:10.920> that's<00:01:11.070> less<00:01:11.340> than<00:01:11.549> a

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
smallest prime that's less than a

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.520 
smallest prime that's less than a
thousand<00:01:12.060> so<00:01:12.210> let's<00:01:12.450> try<00:01:12.750> a<00:01:12.780> thousand<00:01:13.320> and<00:01:13.500> one

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
thousand so let's try a thousand and one

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.429 
thousand so let's try a thousand and one
so<00:01:14.130> I<00:01:14.159> put<00:01:14.430> in<00:01:14.549> an<00:01:14.790> equation<00:01:15.210> here<00:01:15.689> I'm<00:01:16.320> gonna

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
so I put in an equation here I'm gonna

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.300 
so I put in an equation here I'm gonna
do<00:01:16.680> equals<00:01:17.159> a<00:01:17.430> thousand<00:01:18.330> and<00:01:18.479> one<00:01:19.280> divided<00:01:20.280> by

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
do equals a thousand and one divided by

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.960 
do equals a thousand and one divided by
the<00:01:21.060> divisor<00:01:22.049> on<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:22.470> left<00:01:22.700> this<00:01:23.700> is<00:01:23.850> an

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
the divisor on the left this is an

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:30.020 
the divisor on the left this is an
explicit<00:01:24.420> equation<00:01:26.210> and<00:01:27.210> then<00:01:27.750> I<00:01:28.880> select<00:01:29.880> the

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
explicit equation and then I select the

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.080 
explicit equation and then I select the
cell<00:01:30.829> get<00:01:31.829> to<00:01:32.009> the<00:01:32.130> fill<00:01:32.369> handle<00:01:32.579> where<00:01:32.880> I<00:01:32.939> have

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
cell get to the fill handle where I have

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.039 
cell get to the fill handle where I have
the<00:01:33.240> black<00:01:33.450> cross<00:01:33.689> and<00:01:34.079> drag<00:01:34.890> down<00:01:36.049> maybe

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
the black cross and drag down maybe

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.740 
the black cross and drag down maybe
that's<00:01:37.320> far<00:01:37.650> enough

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:38.750 
that's far enough

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:45.859 
that's far enough
and<00:01:39.750> we<00:01:40.020> can<00:01:40.229> see<00:01:40.560> right<00:01:40.979> here<00:01:41.390> that<00:01:44.720> seven<00:01:45.720> is

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
and we can see right here that seven is

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:53.330 
and we can see right here that seven is
a<00:01:45.899> divisor<00:01:46.399> as<00:01:47.399> our<00:01:47.670> 11<00:01:48.210> 13<00:01:49.110> and<00:01:50.689> 77<00:01:51.689> 91<00:01:52.170> and<00:01:52.350> 143

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
a divisor as our 11 13 and 77 91 and 143

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.910 
a divisor as our 11 13 and 77 91 and 143
okay<00:01:54.299> so<00:01:54.360> clearly<00:01:54.780> a<00:01:54.899> thousand<00:01:55.409> and<00:01:55.560> one<00:01:55.590> is

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
okay so clearly a thousand and one is

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.940 
okay so clearly a thousand and one is
not<00:01:56.159> prime<00:01:56.659> but<00:01:57.659> let's<00:01:57.899> just<00:01:58.079> take<00:01:58.290> a<00:01:58.350> closer

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
not prime but let's just take a closer

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.969 
not prime but let's just take a closer
look<00:01:59.159> right<00:01:59.610> now<00:01:59.990> at<00:02:00.990> what<00:02:01.469> we've<00:02:01.619> got<00:02:01.649> in

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
look right now at what we've got in

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.760 
look right now at what we've got in
these<00:02:02.130> columns<00:02:02.930> something<00:02:03.930> to<00:02:04.079> notice<00:02:04.500> for

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
these columns something to notice for

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.609 
these columns something to notice for
later<00:02:04.979> now<00:02:05.790> at<00:02:06.299> the<00:02:06.540> top<00:02:06.780> of<00:02:06.810> the<00:02:07.079> list<00:02:07.320> the

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
later now at the top of the list the

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.680 
later now at the top of the list the
divisor<00:02:08.310> is<00:02:08.670> always<00:02:09.000> smaller<00:02:09.330> than<00:02:09.599> the

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
divisor is always smaller than the

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:10.540 
divisor is always smaller than the
quotient

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.550 
quotient

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:12.140 
quotient
everything<00:02:11.550> on<00:02:11.670> the<00:02:11.790> screen

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
everything on the screen

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.119 
everything on the screen
the<00:02:12.510> divisor<00:02:12.870> is<00:02:13.110> smaller<00:02:13.379> than<00:02:13.650> the<00:02:13.769> question

00:02:14.119 --> 00:02:14.129 
the divisor is smaller than the question

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:21.190 
the divisor is smaller than the question
but<00:02:15.060> at<00:02:15.209> a<00:02:15.239> certain<00:02:15.750> point<00:02:16.640> right<00:02:17.640> about<00:02:17.909> here

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.770 

we<00:02:22.200> start<00:02:22.560> finding<00:02:23.280> that<00:02:23.610> the<00:02:23.879> divisor<00:02:24.480> is

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
we start finding that the divisor is

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.960 
we start finding that the divisor is
bigger<00:02:24.989> than<00:02:25.170> the<00:02:25.290> question<00:02:25.640> and<00:02:28.099> the<00:02:29.099> pairs

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
bigger than the question and the pairs

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:32.449 
bigger than the question and the pairs
that<00:02:30.090> we<00:02:30.329> found<00:02:30.569> up<00:02:30.750> here<00:02:30.780> say<00:02:31.230> thirteen<00:02:32.220> and

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
that we found up here say thirteen and

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:35.599 
that we found up here say thirteen and
seventy<00:02:32.970> seven<00:02:33.470> will<00:02:34.470> appear<00:02:34.950> after<00:02:35.159> this

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:35.609 
seventy seven will appear after this

00:02:35.609 --> 00:02:37.039 
seventy seven will appear after this
green<00:02:36.090> line<00:02:36.420> again

00:02:37.039 --> 00:02:37.049 
green line again

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:39.080 
green line again
in<00:02:37.109> the<00:02:37.319> other<00:02:37.500> order<00:02:37.829> seventy<00:02:38.579> seven<00:02:38.970> and

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
in the other order seventy seven and

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.710 
in the other order seventy seven and
then<00:02:39.299> thirteen<00:02:40.879> this<00:02:41.879> is<00:02:42.090> important<00:02:42.569> when<00:02:42.689> we

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
then thirteen this is important when we

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.270 
then thirteen this is important when we
want<00:02:43.049> to<00:02:43.140> figure<00:02:43.319> out<00:02:43.530> whether<00:02:43.769> numbers

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
want to figure out whether numbers

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.759 
want to figure out whether numbers
really<00:02:44.639> prime<00:02:45.359> or<00:02:45.540> not<00:02:45.569> and<00:02:45.930> this<00:02:46.319> is<00:02:46.470> a<00:02:46.500> nice

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:46.769 
really prime or not and this is a nice

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:50.180 
really prime or not and this is a nice
way<00:02:47.069> to<00:02:47.099> see<00:02:47.810> what<00:02:48.810> happens<00:02:49.379> around<00:02:49.560> here

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
way to see what happens around here

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:56.270 
way to see what happens around here
somewhere<00:02:50.639> around<00:02:51.470> between<00:02:54.230> 31<00:02:55.230> and<00:02:55.560> 33<00:02:55.859> we

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
somewhere around between 31 and 33 we

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.199 
somewhere around between 31 and 33 we
have<00:02:56.519> the<00:02:56.730> square<00:02:57.120> root<00:02:57.420> of<00:02:58.250> a<00:02:59.250> thousand<00:03:00.090> and

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
have the square root of a thousand and

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:02.960 
have the square root of a thousand and
one<00:03:00.239> and<00:03:00.930> we<00:03:01.530> can<00:03:01.709> tell<00:03:01.950> students<00:03:02.400> this<00:03:02.519> rule

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
one and we can tell students this rule

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:04.849 
one and we can tell students this rule
of<00:03:03.180> a<00:03:03.359> check<00:03:03.689> all<00:03:03.870> the<00:03:03.959> divisors<00:03:04.409> up<00:03:04.590> to<00:03:04.739> the

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:04.859 
of a check all the divisors up to the

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:07.009 
of a check all the divisors up to the
square<00:03:05.129> root<00:03:05.310> but<00:03:05.670> it<00:03:06.000> doesn't<00:03:06.480> always<00:03:06.659> make

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:07.019 
square root but it doesn't always make

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:09.770 
square root but it doesn't always make
sense<00:03:07.079> to<00:03:07.590> them<00:03:07.739> and<00:03:08.269> what<00:03:09.269> I'm<00:03:09.389> doing<00:03:09.659> in

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
sense to them and what I'm doing in

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.379 
sense to them and what I'm doing in
Excel<00:03:10.139> can<00:03:10.379> be<00:03:10.530> a<00:03:10.560> nice<00:03:10.769> intermediate<00:03:11.519> step<00:03:12.150> to

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:12.389 
Excel can be a nice intermediate step to

00:03:12.389 --> 00:03:14.390 
Excel can be a nice intermediate step to
making<00:03:12.599> sense<00:03:12.959> of<00:03:13.139> why<00:03:13.260> that<00:03:13.470> happens<00:03:13.859> so<00:03:14.220> I

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
making sense of why that happens so I

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:19.009 
making sense of why that happens so I
just<00:03:14.639> want<00:03:14.849> to<00:03:15.139> clear<00:03:16.370> everything<00:03:17.370> here<00:03:18.019> clear

00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:19.019 
just want to clear everything here clear

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:21.140 
just want to clear everything here clear
the<00:03:19.199> highlighting<00:03:19.799> and<00:03:20.160> now<00:03:20.910> I'm<00:03:21.030> gonna

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
the highlighting and now I'm gonna

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:26.479 
the highlighting and now I'm gonna
change<00:03:21.569> my<00:03:21.859> equation<00:03:24.709> from<00:03:25.709> I'm<00:03:26.129> just<00:03:26.190> gonna

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:26.489 
change my equation from I'm just gonna

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:27.979 
change my equation from I'm just gonna
change<00:03:26.760> the<00:03:26.910> a<00:03:26.940> thousand<00:03:27.419> and<00:03:27.569> one<00:03:27.720> to<00:03:27.959> a

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:27.989 
change the a thousand and one to a

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:30.140 
change the a thousand and one to a
thousand<00:03:28.530> and<00:03:28.590> three<00:03:28.919> I<00:03:29.280> know<00:03:29.489> a<00:03:29.519> thousand<00:03:30.000> and

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
thousand and three I know a thousand and

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:32.089 
thousand and three I know a thousand and
two<00:03:30.299> isn't<00:03:30.540> prime<00:03:30.930> I'm<00:03:31.230> looking<00:03:31.620> for<00:03:31.799> the<00:03:31.889> next

00:03:32.089 --> 00:03:32.099 
two isn't prime I'm looking for the next

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:37.939 
two isn't prime I'm looking for the next
prime<00:03:32.370> and<00:03:34.190> now<00:03:35.190> I<00:03:36.349> have<00:03:37.349> to<00:03:37.530> drag<00:03:37.739> that

00:03:37.939 --> 00:03:37.949 
prime and now I have to drag that

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:41.990 
prime and now I have to drag that
formula<00:03:38.190> down<00:03:38.639> again<00:03:38.970> I<00:03:40.549> dragged<00:03:41.549> it<00:03:41.669> a<00:03:41.790> little

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
formula down again I dragged it a little

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.719 
formula down again I dragged it a little
too<00:03:42.120> far<00:03:42.389> but<00:03:42.599> that's<00:03:42.750> okay<00:03:43.169> I<00:03:43.409> can<00:03:44.400> see<00:03:44.609> right

00:03:44.719 --> 00:03:44.729 
too far but that's okay I can see right

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:47.509 
too far but that's okay I can see right
now<00:03:44.790> that<00:03:45.150> a<00:03:45.180> thousand<00:03:45.780> and<00:03:45.900> three<00:03:46.109> is<00:03:46.519> 17

00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:47.519 
now that a thousand and three is 17

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:51.830 
now that a thousand and three is 17
times<00:03:47.790> 59<00:03:48.329> so<00:03:49.019> that's<00:03:49.229> not<00:03:49.500> prime<00:03:49.889> either<00:03:50.840> now

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
times 59 so that's not prime either now

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.270 
times 59 so that's not prime either now
I<00:03:51.870> have<00:03:52.199> to<00:03:52.290> say<00:03:52.470> it's<00:03:52.590> a<00:03:52.650> little<00:03:52.919> bit<00:03:53.040> of<00:03:53.159> a

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 
I have to say it's a little bit of a

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.039 
I have to say it's a little bit of a
pain<00:03:53.519> they<00:03:53.699> have<00:03:53.879> to<00:03:54.030> keep<00:03:54.180> typing<00:03:54.720> the

00:03:55.039 --> 00:03:55.049 
pain they have to keep typing the

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:57.199 
pain they have to keep typing the
formula<00:03:55.500> again<00:03:55.560> and<00:03:55.829> again<00:03:56.069> so<00:03:56.370> I'm<00:03:56.669> gonna<00:03:56.790> use

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:57.209 
formula again and again so I'm gonna use

00:03:57.209 --> 00:03:59.899 
formula again and again so I'm gonna use
a<00:03:57.599> reference<00:03:58.530> for<00:03:58.769> that<00:03:58.829> instead<00:03:59.430> I'll<00:03:59.669> put

00:03:59.899 --> 00:03:59.909 
a reference for that instead I'll put

00:03:59.909 --> 00:04:06.770 
a reference for that instead I'll put
the<00:04:00.090> dividend<00:04:00.629> in<00:04:00.989> this<00:04:01.199> cell<00:04:01.560> so<00:04:05.449> so<00:04:06.449> let's

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780 
the dividend in this cell so so let's

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:07.879 
the dividend in this cell so so let's
see<00:04:06.870> the<00:04:07.049> next<00:04:07.169> one<00:04:07.379> we<00:04:07.500> just<00:04:07.709> tried<00:04:07.859> a

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:07.889 
see the next one we just tried a

00:04:07.889 --> 00:04:09.830 
see the next one we just tried a
thousand<00:04:08.370> and<00:04:08.489> three<00:04:08.639> wasn't<00:04:09.090> prime<00:04:09.449> a

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 
thousand and three wasn't prime a

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.960 
thousand and three wasn't prime a
thousand<00:04:10.709> and<00:04:10.829> five<00:04:11.010> we<00:04:11.280> know<00:04:11.430> isn't<00:04:11.609> prime

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:11.970 
thousand and five we know isn't prime

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:13.759 
thousand and five we know isn't prime
that's<00:04:12.150> clearly<00:04:12.599> divisible<00:04:12.810> by<00:04:13.079> five<00:04:13.470> so

00:04:13.759 --> 00:04:13.769 
that's clearly divisible by five so

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:17.779 
that's clearly divisible by five so
let's<00:04:13.799> try<00:04:14.220> a<00:04:14.250> thousand<00:04:14.790> and<00:04:14.940> seven<00:04:16.159> and<00:04:17.159> now

00:04:17.779 --> 00:04:17.789 
let's try a thousand and seven and now

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:20.930 
let's try a thousand and seven and now
what<00:04:17.940> I'm<00:04:18.030> gonna<00:04:18.150> do<00:04:18.449> is<00:04:19.400> I'm<00:04:20.400> gonna<00:04:20.549> change

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna change

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:23.530 
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna change
this<00:04:21.150> formula

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:23.540 
this formula

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:26.960 
this formula
but<00:04:24.540> instead<00:04:25.110> of<00:04:25.170> putting<00:04:25.890> the<00:04:26.070> actual<00:04:26.550> number

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:26.970 
but instead of putting the actual number

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:31.280 
but instead of putting the actual number
in<00:04:27.090> here<00:04:27.390> what's<00:04:27.720> the<00:04:27.900> square<00:04:28.820> f6<00:04:30.050> I'm<00:04:31.050> gonna

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:31.290 
in here what's the square f6 I'm gonna

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:33.260 
in here what's the square f6 I'm gonna
put<00:04:31.560> this<00:04:31.770> square<00:04:32.100> here<00:04:32.310> and<00:04:32.550> now<00:04:32.700> I<00:04:32.730> need<00:04:33.090> to

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:33.270 
put this square here and now I need to

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:36.860 
put this square here and now I need to
do<00:04:33.480> dollar<00:04:34.230> sign<00:04:34.710> F<00:04:34.950> dollar<00:04:35.550> sign<00:04:35.970> six<00:04:36.360> because

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:36.870 
do dollar sign F dollar sign six because

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:40.280 
do dollar sign F dollar sign six because
I<00:04:37.020> really<00:04:37.620> mean<00:04:37.830> square<00:04:38.220> f<00:04:38.430> six<00:04:38.880> I<00:04:39.240> don't<00:04:39.960> ever

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:40.290 
I really mean square f six I don't ever

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:42.140 
I really mean square f six I don't ever
want<00:04:40.650> that<00:04:40.830> to<00:04:41.010> change<00:04:41.040> its<00:04:41.520> me<00:04:41.730> the<00:04:41.760> same

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:42.150 
want that to change its me the same

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:47.360 
want that to change its me the same
dividend<00:04:42.690> every<00:04:42.900> time<00:04:43.880> okay<00:04:44.880> and<00:04:45.620> so<00:04:46.620> I<00:04:47.010> drag

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:47.370 
dividend every time okay and so I drag

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:48.950 
dividend every time okay and so I drag
this<00:04:47.550> formula<00:04:47.820> but<00:04:48.180> that's<00:04:48.360> the<00:04:48.480> last<00:04:48.690> time

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:48.960 
this formula but that's the last time

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:53.270 
this formula but that's the last time
I'm<00:04:49.080> going<00:04:49.200> to<00:04:49.260> have<00:04:49.410> to<00:04:49.530> drag<00:04:49.860> it<00:04:51.980> just<00:04:52.980> go<00:04:53.250> to

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:53.280 
I'm going to have to drag it just go to

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:57.800 
I'm going to have to drag it just go to
the<00:04:53.490> end<00:04:53.640> here<00:04:54.320> and<00:04:55.580> I<00:04:56.580> can<00:04:57.000> see<00:04:57.390> that<00:04:57.750> a

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:57.810 
the end here and I can see that a

00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:59.810 
the end here and I can see that a
thousand<00:04:58.410> and<00:04:58.560> seven<00:04:58.890> is<00:04:59.010> not<00:04:59.190> prime<00:04:59.520> either

00:04:59.810 --> 00:04:59.820 
thousand and seven is not prime either

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:04.610 
thousand and seven is not prime either
we<00:05:00.090> have<00:05:00.330> 19<00:05:01.200> times<00:05:01.640> 53<00:05:02.930> now<00:05:03.930> this<00:05:04.140> time<00:05:04.410> when<00:05:04.590> I

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:04.620 
we have 19 times 53 now this time when I

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:08.030 
we have 19 times 53 now this time when I
want<00:05:04.860> to<00:05:04.980> try<00:05:05.160> a<00:05:05.190> thousand<00:05:05.700> and<00:05:05.820> nine<00:05:06.060> I<00:05:07.040> can

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:08.040 
want to try a thousand and nine I can

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:10.970 
want to try a thousand and nine I can
just<00:05:08.250> type<00:05:08.760> it<00:05:08.940> in<00:05:09.060> this<00:05:09.330> cell<00:05:09.660> and<00:05:09.990> it<00:05:10.860> will

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:10.980 
just type it in this cell and it will

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:13.460 
just type it in this cell and it will
automatically<00:05:11.820> update<00:05:12.020> everything<00:05:13.020> which

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:13.470 
automatically update everything which

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:16.220 
automatically update everything which
makes<00:05:14.010> my<00:05:14.160> life<00:05:14.340> easier<00:05:14.730> now<00:05:15.600> let's<00:05:15.840> see<00:05:16.020> I'm

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:16.230 
makes my life easier now let's see I'm

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:18.320 
makes my life easier now let's see I'm
looking<00:05:16.650> for<00:05:16.950> whole<00:05:17.580> numbers<00:05:17.850> in<00:05:18.240> the

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:18.330 
looking for whole numbers in the

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:21.740 
looking for whole numbers in the
quotient<00:05:18.750> column<00:05:19.170> and<00:05:20.010> I<00:05:20.100> don't<00:05:20.160> see<00:05:20.640> any<00:05:20.850> so

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:21.750 
quotient column and I don't see any so

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:24.110 
quotient column and I don't see any so
this<00:05:21.900> is<00:05:22.080> a<00:05:22.110> question<00:05:22.620> how<00:05:22.860> far<00:05:23.460> do<00:05:23.610> I<00:05:23.640> have<00:05:23.730> to

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:24.120 
this is a question how far do I have to

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:26.600 
this is a question how far do I have to
check<00:05:24.360> and<00:05:24.800> this<00:05:25.800> goes<00:05:26.010> back<00:05:26.040> to<00:05:26.250> what<00:05:26.520> we

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:26.610 
check and this goes back to what we

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:29.510 
check and this goes back to what we
talked<00:05:26.880> about<00:05:27.000> before<00:05:27.360> if<00:05:28.230> the<00:05:28.740> divisors<00:05:29.250> and

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:29.520 
talked about before if the divisors and

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:32.930 
talked about before if the divisors and
quotients<00:05:30.350> would<00:05:31.350> probably<00:05:31.890> appear<00:05:32.280> as<00:05:32.460> pairs

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:32.940 
quotients would probably appear as pairs

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:35.450 
quotients would probably appear as pairs
unless<00:05:33.870> unless<00:05:34.350> we're<00:05:34.740> talking<00:05:35.250> about<00:05:35.340> a

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:35.460 
unless unless we're talking about a

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:37.550 
unless unless we're talking about a
perfect<00:05:35.910> square<00:05:36.060> and<00:05:36.420> so<00:05:37.110> if<00:05:37.170> the<00:05:37.320> pair

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:37.560 
perfect square and so if the pair

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:40.250 
perfect square and so if the pair
appears<00:05:38.130> first<00:05:38.430> with<00:05:38.760> the<00:05:38.910> smaller<00:05:39.270> divisor

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:40.260 
appears first with the smaller divisor

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:43.010 
appears first with the smaller divisor
and<00:05:40.650> bigger<00:05:40.860> quotient<00:05:41.480> it'll<00:05:42.480> appear<00:05:42.810> later

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:43.020 
and bigger quotient it'll appear later

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:44.720 
and bigger quotient it'll appear later
with<00:05:43.290> the<00:05:43.440> bigger<00:05:43.620> divisor<00:05:44.070> and<00:05:44.430> smaller

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:44.730 
with the bigger divisor and smaller

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:47.750 
with the bigger divisor and smaller
question<00:05:45.150> so<00:05:45.330> we<00:05:45.450> just<00:05:45.690> need<00:05:45.870> to<00:05:46.020> look<00:05:46.290> at<00:05:46.760> when

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:47.760 
question so we just need to look at when

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:49.700 
question so we just need to look at when
this<00:05:48.030> first<00:05:48.270> column<00:05:48.630> starts<00:05:49.140> getting<00:05:49.530> bigger

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:49.710 
this first column starts getting bigger

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:51.650 
this first column starts getting bigger
than<00:05:49.950> the<00:05:50.100> second<00:05:50.490> column<00:05:50.670> and<00:05:50.910> it<00:05:51.060> sits<00:05:51.270> in<00:05:51.480> a

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:51.660 
than the second column and it sits in a

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:55.760 
than the second column and it sits in a
similar<00:05:52.140> place<00:05:52.350> again<00:05:53.960> right<00:05:54.960> around<00:05:55.320> here

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:55.770 
similar place again right around here

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:59.090 
similar place again right around here
and<00:05:56.060> we<00:05:57.060> don't<00:05:57.210> see<00:05:58.110> we<00:05:58.410> really<00:05:58.650> don't<00:05:58.770> have<00:05:58.890> to

00:05:59.090 --> 00:05:59.100 
and we don't see we really don't have to

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:00.890 
and we don't see we really don't have to
check<00:05:59.280> that<00:05:59.340> many<00:05:59.700> numbers<00:06:00.120> and<00:06:00.360> of<00:06:00.510> course<00:06:00.720> if

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:00.900 
check that many numbers and of course if

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:02.870 
check that many numbers and of course if
we<00:06:00.960> were<00:06:01.140> using<00:06:01.320> a<00:06:01.740> calculator<00:06:02.130> say<00:06:02.730> we

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:02.880 
we were using a calculator say we

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:04.610 
we were using a calculator say we
wouldn't<00:06:03.030> even<00:06:03.180> need<00:06:03.450> to<00:06:03.570> check<00:06:03.780> nine<00:06:04.020> because

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:04.620 
wouldn't even need to check nine because

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:07.340 
wouldn't even need to check nine because
we<00:06:04.770> already<00:06:04.920> checked<00:06:05.310> three<00:06:05.700> but<00:06:06.660> introducing

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:07.350 
we already checked three but introducing

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:09.290 
we already checked three but introducing
this<00:06:07.500> little<00:06:07.800> bit<00:06:07.950> of<00:06:08.040> inefficiency<00:06:08.310> doesn't

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:09.300 
this little bit of inefficiency doesn't

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:11.270 
this little bit of inefficiency doesn't
doesn't<00:06:09.840> really<00:06:10.170> matter<00:06:10.470> for<00:06:10.620> a<00:06:10.800> problem<00:06:11.160> like

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:11.280 
doesn't really matter for a problem like

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:14.120 
doesn't really matter for a problem like
this<00:06:11.430> because<00:06:11.880> it's<00:06:12.090> so<00:06:12.270> quick<00:06:12.510> to<00:06:12.690> do<00:06:12.860> so<00:06:13.860> yes

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:14.130 
this because it's so quick to do so yes

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:16.130 
this because it's so quick to do so yes
we<00:06:14.370> have<00:06:14.580> our<00:06:14.610> answer<00:06:14.880> a<00:06:15.090> thousand<00:06:15.840> and<00:06:15.960> nine

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:16.140 
we have our answer a thousand and nine

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:19.580 
we have our answer a thousand and nine
is<00:06:16.500> from<00:06:16.920> and<00:06:17.450> as<00:06:18.450> long<00:06:18.690> as<00:06:18.840> we're<00:06:19.080> doing<00:06:19.290> all

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:19.590 
is from and as long as we're doing all

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:21.890 
is from and as long as we're doing all
of<00:06:19.620> this<00:06:19.890> we<00:06:20.430> could<00:06:20.670> just<00:06:21.120> as<00:06:21.330> well<00:06:21.510> check<00:06:21.840> a

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:21.900 
of this we could just as well check a

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:23.600 
of this we could just as well check a
thousand<00:06:22.500> and<00:06:22.590> eleven<00:06:22.680> which<00:06:23.160> if<00:06:23.340> you<00:06:23.490> know

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:23.610 
thousand and eleven which if you know

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:25.790 
thousand and eleven which if you know
some<00:06:23.910> divisibility<00:06:24.690> tricks<00:06:25.230> you<00:06:25.440> know<00:06:25.590> it's

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:25.800 
some divisibility tricks you know it's

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:29.000 
some divisibility tricks you know it's
divisible<00:06:26.460> by<00:06:26.520> three<00:06:27.140> how<00:06:28.140> about<00:06:28.380> a<00:06:28.410> thousand

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:29.010 
divisible by three how about a thousand

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:30.210 
divisible by three how about a thousand
and

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:30.220 
and

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:35.290 
and
thirteen<00:06:32.530> thousand<00:06:33.530> and<00:06:33.650> thirteen<00:06:34.160> see<00:06:35.150> we're

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:35.300 
thirteen thousand and thirteen see we're

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:37.210 
thirteen thousand and thirteen see we're
still<00:06:35.509> pretty<00:06:35.720> close<00:06:35.990> that's<00:06:36.350> that's<00:06:36.979> where

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:37.220 
still pretty close that's that's where

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:39.100 
still pretty close that's that's where
the<00:06:37.370> barriers<00:06:37.610> so<00:06:38.060> thousand<00:06:38.419> and<00:06:38.570> thirteen<00:06:38.930> is

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:39.110 
the barriers so thousand and thirteen is

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:43.499 
the barriers so thousand and thirteen is
another<00:06:39.440> prime<00:06:39.830> and<00:06:40.539> and<00:06:41.539> so<00:06:42.110> on<00:06:42.380> and<00:06:42.740> so<00:06:42.919> on<00:06:42.949> so

00:06:43.499 --> 00:06:43.509 
another prime and and so on and so on so

00:06:43.509 --> 00:06:45.850 
another prime and and so on and so on so
this<00:06:44.509> is<00:06:44.720> students<00:06:45.199> like<00:06:45.350> this<00:06:45.590> method

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:45.860 
this is students like this method

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:50.920 
this is students like this method
actually<00:06:46.580> and<00:06:46.789> I<00:06:47.150> like<00:06:47.539> it<00:06:47.780> because<00:06:49.930> it's

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:50.930 
actually and I like it because it's

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:53.650 
actually and I like it because it's
