rather<00:00:00.269> than<00:00:00.510> mount<00:00:00.750> a<00:00:00.840> battery<00:00:01.230> back<00:00:01.410> here

00:00:01.699 --> 00:00:01.709 
rather than mount a battery back here

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:04.100 
rather than mount a battery back here
I've<00:00:01.890> decided<00:00:02.280> to<00:00:02.520> just<00:00:03.179> run<00:00:03.419> these<00:00:03.659> straight

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:04.110 
I've decided to just run these straight

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:06.470 
I've decided to just run these straight
to<00:00:04.350> the<00:00:04.440> truck<00:00:04.799> once<00:00:05.790> I<00:00:05.879> have<00:00:06.029> to<00:00:06.180> have<00:00:06.330> them

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:06.480 
to the truck once I have to have them

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:07.909 
to the truck once I have to have them
where<00:00:06.690> I<00:00:06.720> can<00:00:06.990> break<00:00:07.200> it<00:00:07.379> loose<00:00:07.529> when<00:00:07.830> I

00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:07.919 
where I can break it loose when I

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:10.879 
where I can break it loose when I
disconnect<00:00:08.550> this<00:00:08.790> and<00:00:09.630> I'm<00:00:10.500> thinking<00:00:10.800> about

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
disconnect this and I'm thinking about

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:12.350 
disconnect this and I'm thinking about
how<00:00:11.099> to<00:00:11.130> get<00:00:11.370> a<00:00:11.400> wire<00:00:11.610> from<00:00:11.849> the<00:00:11.910> battery<00:00:11.969> of

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
how to get a wire from the battery of

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.959 
how to get a wire from the battery of
the<00:00:12.450> truck<00:00:12.660> back<00:00:12.929> here<00:00:13.280> and<00:00:14.280> have<00:00:14.490> these<00:00:14.670> old

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
the truck back here and have these old

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.920 
the truck back here and have these old
jumper<00:00:15.660> cables<00:00:16.199> these<00:00:16.350> are<00:00:16.500> big<00:00:16.800> heavy<00:00:17.930> jumper

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
jumper cables these are big heavy jumper

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.080 
jumper cables these are big heavy jumper
cables<00:00:19.490> tractor-trailer<00:00:20.490> tight<00:00:20.699> jumper

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
cables tractor-trailer tight jumper

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:22.730 
cables tractor-trailer tight jumper
cables<00:00:21.510> that<00:00:21.630> I<00:00:21.720> found<00:00:21.990> the<00:00:22.140> dumpster<00:00:22.560> one

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
cables that I found the dumpster one

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.830 
cables that I found the dumpster one
time<00:00:23.010> and<00:00:23.279> some<00:00:24.029> of<00:00:24.060> them<00:00:24.210> has<00:00:24.330> a<00:00:24.359> little<00:00:24.720> bit

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
time and some of them has a little bit

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.540 
time and some of them has a little bit
of<00:00:24.960> a<00:00:25.019> damaged<00:00:25.410> clamp<00:00:25.769> like<00:00:26.070> this<00:00:26.279> one<00:00:26.460> the

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
of a damaged clamp like this one the

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.880 
of a damaged clamp like this one the
springs<00:00:26.960> kind<00:00:27.960> of<00:00:28.050> wore<00:00:28.199> out<00:00:28.230> in<00:00:28.500> the<00:00:28.560> clamp

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
springs kind of wore out in the clamp

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.440 
springs kind of wore out in the clamp
and<00:00:30.170> you<00:00:31.170> know<00:00:31.730> still<00:00:32.730> a<00:00:32.790> lot<00:00:32.969> of<00:00:33.000> good<00:00:33.180> wire

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
and you know still a lot of good wire

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:34.940 
and you know still a lot of good wire
and<00:00:33.780> a<00:00:33.840> good<00:00:33.989> connector<00:00:34.440> in<00:00:34.559> there<00:00:34.739> so<00:00:34.860> I<00:00:34.890> think

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
and a good connector in there so I think

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.290 
and a good connector in there so I think
what<00:00:35.130> I'm<00:00:35.190> going<00:00:35.309> to<00:00:35.340> do<00:00:35.460> is<00:00:35.610> just<00:00:35.790> break<00:00:36.030> this

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
what I'm going to do is just break this

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.100 
what I'm going to do is just break this
loose<00:00:36.600> and<00:00:38.180> bring<00:00:39.180> up<00:00:39.329> a<00:00:39.450> way<00:00:39.600> to<00:00:39.660> get<00:00:39.899> fire

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
loose and bring up a way to get fire

00:00:40.110 --> 00:01:02.040 
loose and bring up a way to get fire
from<00:00:40.350> the<00:00:40.469> battery<00:00:40.860> back<00:00:41.040> here<00:00:41.340> using<00:00:41.760> that

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:02.050 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:04.180 

okay<00:01:03.050> I<00:01:03.080> was<00:01:03.290> thinking<00:01:03.530> I<00:01:03.590> would<00:01:03.739> test<00:01:03.980> this

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:04.190 
okay I was thinking I would test this

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:05.710 
okay I was thinking I would test this
thing<00:01:04.430> before<00:01:04.640> I<00:01:04.820> went<00:01:04.970> any<00:01:05.030> further<00:01:05.150> so<00:01:05.660> I've

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:05.720 
thing before I went any further so I've

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.010 
thing before I went any further so I've
got<00:01:05.930> that<00:01:06.850> jumper<00:01:07.850> cable<00:01:08.210> hooking<00:01:08.479> my<00:01:08.600> battery

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:09.020 
got that jumper cable hooking my battery

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:11.770 
got that jumper cable hooking my battery
on<00:01:09.140> hot<00:01:09.350> side<00:01:09.790> and<00:01:10.790> then<00:01:10.910> connected<00:01:11.390> again<00:01:11.510> to

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:11.780 
on hot side and then connected again to

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:13.719 
on hot side and then connected again to
that<00:01:11.960> jumper<00:01:12.380> cable<00:01:12.800> which<00:01:12.979> connects<00:01:13.460> over

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:13.729 
that jumper cable which connects over

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:16.719 
that jumper cable which connects over
here<00:01:14.350> to<00:01:15.350> the<00:01:15.470> hot<00:01:15.619> side<00:01:15.890> and<00:01:16.280> I<00:01:16.460> got<00:01:16.610> the

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:16.729 
here to the hot side and I got the

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:18.280 
here to the hot side and I got the
ground<00:01:16.910> side<00:01:17.240> hooked<00:01:17.510> to<00:01:17.630> a<00:01:17.660> short<00:01:17.960> jumper

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:18.290 
ground side hooked to a short jumper

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:20.560 
ground side hooked to a short jumper
cable<00:01:18.619> that<00:01:18.770> runs<00:01:18.800> up<00:01:19.190> to<00:01:19.220> the<00:01:19.430> metal<00:01:20.300> on<00:01:20.450> the

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:20.570 
cable that runs up to the metal on the

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
cable that runs up to the metal on the
trailer<00:01:20.930> what<00:01:21.770> I'm<00:01:21.860> gonna<00:01:21.950> do<00:01:22.070> now<00:01:22.310> just<00:01:23.210> a

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:23.590 
trailer what I'm gonna do now just a

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:27.430 
trailer what I'm gonna do now just a
test<00:01:24.590> wireman<00:01:25.130> basically<00:01:25.990> is<00:01:26.990> I'm<00:01:27.110> gonna<00:01:27.200> pull

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:27.440 
test wireman basically is I'm gonna pull

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:35.499 
test wireman basically is I'm gonna pull
some<00:01:27.470> cable<00:01:28.009> out<00:01:32.380> drag<00:01:34.030> or<00:01:35.030> maybe<00:01:35.330> I'll<00:01:35.479> use

00:01:35.499 --> 00:01:35.509 
some cable out drag or maybe I'll use

00:01:35.509 --> 00:02:10.770 
some cable out drag or maybe I'll use
that<00:01:35.780> over

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:10.780 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:16.990 

mr.<00:02:11.780> pods<00:02:12.020> been<00:02:12.260> drinking<00:02:12.620> again<00:02:15.970> okay<00:02:16.970> I

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
mr. pods been drinking again okay I

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.790 
mr. pods been drinking again okay I
think<00:02:17.180> much<00:02:17.480> of<00:02:17.510> a<00:02:17.660> test<00:02:17.900> in<00:02:18.200> that<00:02:18.440> that's<00:02:18.620> not

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:18.800 
think much of a test in that that's not

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.230 
think much of a test in that that's not
very<00:02:18.950> heavy<00:02:19.160> but<00:02:19.400> at<00:02:19.520> least<00:02:19.670> I'll<00:02:19.820> see<00:02:20.060> if<00:02:20.120> it

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:20.240 
very heavy but at least I'll see if it

00:02:20.240 --> 00:03:24.410 
very heavy but at least I'll see if it
works

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.610 

right<00:03:25.420> little<00:03:25.630> noise<00:03:25.900> but<00:03:26.140> she<00:03:26.260> didn't<00:03:26.440> work

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620 
right little noise but she didn't work

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:29.280 
right little noise but she didn't work
but<00:03:27.010> I<00:03:27.040> don't<00:03:27.460> have<00:03:27.670> a<00:03:27.730> lot<00:03:28.060> of<00:03:28.290> connection

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.290 
but I don't have a lot of connection

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:49.170 
but I don't have a lot of connection
here

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:49.180 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:53.080 

I<00:03:51.040> got<00:03:52.040> this<00:03:52.190> figure<00:03:52.520> out<00:03:52.550> better<00:03:52.819> way<00:03:53.030> to

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:53.090 
I got this figure out better way to

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:56.080 
I got this figure out better way to
connect<00:03:53.540> this<00:03:53.780> wire<00:03:54.130> that<00:03:55.130> wire<00:03:55.430> for<00:03:56.000> the

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:56.090 
connect this wire that wire for the

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:58.690 
connect this wire that wire for the
batteries<00:03:56.510> with<00:03:56.690> the<00:03:56.810> sender<00:03:57.170> I<00:03:57.640> think<00:03:58.640> the

00:03:58.690 --> 00:03:58.700 
batteries with the sender I think the

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:00.520 
batteries with the sender I think the
problem<00:03:59.060> I'm<00:03:59.150> having<00:03:59.330> is<00:03:59.630> getting<00:03:59.930> my<00:04:00.080> wire<00:04:00.319> to

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:00.530 
problem I'm having is getting my wire to

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:01.900 
problem I'm having is getting my wire to
make<00:04:00.680> a<00:04:00.709> connection<00:04:01.100> so<00:04:01.580> it's<00:04:01.700> kind<00:04:01.880> of

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:01.910 
make a connection so it's kind of

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:18.860 
make a connection so it's kind of
modified<00:04:02.420> my<00:04:02.630> connection<00:04:03.200> there

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:18.870 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:24.179 

so<00:04:19.870> what<00:04:20.739> I<00:04:20.829> need<00:04:20.919> to<00:04:21.039> do<00:04:22.620> is<00:04:23.620> to<00:04:23.770> come<00:04:23.949> up<00:04:24.069> with

00:04:24.179 --> 00:04:24.189 
so what I need to do is to come up with

00:04:24.189 --> 00:04:27.929 
so what I need to do is to come up with
a<00:04:24.250> better<00:04:24.460> plan<00:04:24.639> for<00:04:25.030> this<00:04:25.830> and<00:04:26.830> I've<00:04:27.699> got<00:04:27.909> a

00:04:27.929 --> 00:04:27.939 
a better plan for this and I've got a

00:04:27.939 --> 00:04:29.879 
a better plan for this and I've got a
variety<00:04:28.150> of<00:04:28.479> different<00:04:28.569> kind<00:04:29.110> of<00:04:29.229> pieces<00:04:29.710> and
