you<00:03:10.480> have<00:03:10.660> a<00:03:10.980> six<00:03:11.980> row<00:03:12.190> repeat<00:03:12.430> and<00:03:12.790> you<00:03:12.880> want

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 
you have a six row repeat and you want

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.510 
you have a six row repeat and you want
to<00:03:13.150> set<00:03:13.870> that<00:03:14.050> to<00:03:14.590> six<00:03:14.830> you<00:03:14.950> can<00:03:15.100> do<00:03:15.190> that<00:03:15.340> here

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:15.520 
to set that to six you can do that here

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:17.370 
to set that to six you can do that here
if<00:03:15.700> you<00:03:15.790> want<00:03:15.910> to<00:03:15.940> show<00:03:16.090> the<00:03:16.239> progress<00:03:16.480> let's

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:17.380 
if you want to show the progress let's

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:19.560 
if you want to show the progress let's
say<00:03:17.620> it's<00:03:17.799> a<00:03:17.950> seventy-five<00:03:18.670> row<00:03:18.940> pattern<00:03:19.420> and

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:19.570 
say it's a seventy-five row pattern and

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:21.330 
say it's a seventy-five row pattern and
you<00:03:19.630> click<00:03:19.810> the<00:03:19.930> Save<00:03:20.140> button<00:03:20.170> it'll<00:03:21.040> tell<00:03:21.250> you

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.340 
you click the Save button it'll tell you

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:24.600 
you click the Save button it'll tell you
you're<00:03:21.489> on<00:03:21.610> row<00:03:21.790> 52<00:03:22.330> out<00:03:22.600> of<00:03:23.610> seventy-five

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:24.610 
you're on row 52 out of seventy-five

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:27.449 
you're on row 52 out of seventy-five
that's<00:03:24.850> a<00:03:24.910> 70<00:03:25.269> percent<00:03:25.420> progress<00:03:26.340> on<00:03:27.340> the

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:27.459 
that's a 70 percent progress on the

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:28.830 
that's a 70 percent progress on the
right-hand<00:03:27.820> side<00:03:27.880> here<00:03:28.120> you<00:03:28.299> see<00:03:28.450> your<00:03:28.630> rows

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 
right-hand side here you see your rows

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:31.890 
right-hand side here you see your rows
on<00:03:29.140> the<00:03:29.620> left<00:03:29.860> hand<00:03:30.040> side<00:03:30.280> is<00:03:30.549> your<00:03:30.610> repeats<00:03:31.269> so

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:31.900 
on the left hand side is your repeats so

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:35.100 
on the left hand side is your repeats so
there's<00:03:32.560> this<00:03:32.739> check<00:03:33.420> button<00:03:34.420> a<00:03:34.750> check<00:03:34.959> box

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:35.110 
there's this check button a check box

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:36.720 
there's this check button a check box
here<00:03:35.260> that's<00:03:35.470> linking<00:03:36.220> those<00:03:36.340> two<00:03:36.580> together

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:36.730 
here that's linking those two together

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:39.270 
here that's linking those two together
so<00:03:37.630> if<00:03:37.810> you<00:03:37.930> click<00:03:38.170> on<00:03:38.290> a<00:03:38.350> row<00:03:38.560> that'll<00:03:39.070> also

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 
so if you click on a row that'll also

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.039 
so if you click on a row that'll also
increase<00:03:39.850> your<00:03:39.880> repeat<00:03:40.390> so<00:03:40.540> we<00:03:40.630> said<00:03:40.810> it<00:03:40.900> was<00:03:41.019> a

00:03:41.039 --> 00:03:41.049 
increase your repeat so we said it was a

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:44.100 
increase your repeat so we said it was a
six<00:03:41.860> row<00:03:42.040> repeat<00:03:42.250> so<00:03:42.579> after<00:03:42.910> the<00:03:43.600> sixth<00:03:43.930> one

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:44.110 
six row repeat so after the sixth one

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:47.400 
six row repeat so after the sixth one
it'll<00:03:44.430> jump<00:03:45.430> to<00:03:45.579> repeat<00:03:45.910> 2-1<00:03:46.720> if<00:03:46.989> you<00:03:47.110> go<00:03:47.230> back

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:47.410 
it'll jump to repeat 2-1 if you go back

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:50.220 
it'll jump to repeat 2-1 if you go back
it'll<00:03:47.709> still<00:03:48.070> be<00:03:48.160> one<00:03:48.370> -<00:03:48.489> six<00:03:48.790> if<00:03:49.329> you<00:03:49.630> unlike

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:50.230 
it'll still be one - six if you unlike

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:51.720 
it'll still be one - six if you unlike
those<00:03:50.440> two<00:03:50.680> you<00:03:50.890> can<00:03:51.070> move<00:03:51.220> the<00:03:51.400> counters

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:51.730 
those two you can move the counters

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:54.120 
those two you can move the counters
independent<00:03:52.329> one<00:03:52.450> of<00:03:52.570> one<00:03:53.079> another<00:03:53.350> but

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:54.130 
independent one of one another but

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:55.949 
independent one of one another but
otherwise<00:03:54.489> just<00:03:54.790> remember<00:03:55.299> that<00:03:55.450> rows<00:03:55.750> are

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:55.959 
otherwise just remember that rows are

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:57.449 
otherwise just remember that rows are
always<00:03:56.140> on<00:03:56.260> the<00:03:56.320> right<00:03:56.500> repeats<00:03:57.130> are<00:03:57.250> always

00:03:57.449 --> 00:03:57.459 
always on the right repeats are always

00:03:57.459 --> 00:03:59.789 
always on the right repeats are always
on<00:03:57.579> the<00:03:57.670> left<00:03:57.820> these<00:03:58.450> are<00:03:58.600> always<00:03:58.780> increase<00:03:59.470> up

00:03:59.789 --> 00:03:59.799 
on the left these are always increase up

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:01.650 
on the left these are always increase up
here<00:04:00.070> and<00:04:00.250> this<00:04:00.459> is<00:04:00.579> always<00:04:00.850> decrease<00:04:01.450> right

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:01.660 
here and this is always decrease right

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:05.130 
here and this is always decrease right
