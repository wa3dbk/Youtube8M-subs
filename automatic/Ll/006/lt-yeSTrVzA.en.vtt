00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.969 

so<00:00:00.480> this<00:00:00.750> particular<00:00:01.199> frame<00:00:01.439> you<00:00:01.620> know<00:00:01.740> it's<00:00:01.890> a

00:00:01.969 --> 00:00:01.979 
so this particular frame you know it's a

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:04.070 
so this particular frame you know it's a
well<00:00:02.280> made<00:00:02.550> super<00:00:03.030> high<00:00:03.179> in<00:00:03.330> cyclocross<00:00:03.750> bike

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:04.080 
well made super high in cyclocross bike

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.050 
well made super high in cyclocross bike
so<00:00:04.200> they<00:00:04.290> think<00:00:04.529> of<00:00:04.620> little<00:00:04.920> tweaks<00:00:05.220> that<00:00:05.520> are

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:06.060 
so they think of little tweaks that are

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:07.700 
so they think of little tweaks that are
gonna<00:00:06.210> make<00:00:06.299> your<00:00:06.810> brakes<00:00:07.049> work<00:00:07.259> a<00:00:07.379> little<00:00:07.620> bit

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:07.710 
gonna make your brakes work a little bit

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.220 
gonna make your brakes work a little bit
better<00:00:07.890> sometimes<00:00:08.730> if<00:00:09.120> you<00:00:09.240> you<00:00:09.960> know<00:00:10.050> have<00:00:10.200> a

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230 
better sometimes if you you know have a

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.140 
better sometimes if you you know have a
lower<00:00:10.950> and<00:00:11.250> more<00:00:11.460> generic<00:00:11.790> bike<00:00:11.969> that<00:00:12.120> doesn't

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
lower and more generic bike that doesn't

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.860 
lower and more generic bike that doesn't
have<00:00:13.049> stuff<00:00:13.259> like<00:00:13.320> this<00:00:13.500> built<00:00:13.740> in<00:00:13.920> so<00:00:14.870> just

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
have stuff like this built in so just

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.390 
have stuff like this built in so just
like<00:00:16.020> running<00:00:16.379> the<00:00:16.470> front<00:00:16.650> brake<00:00:16.920> can<00:00:17.250> be<00:00:17.369> a

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
like running the front brake can be a

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.519 
like running the front brake can be a
bit<00:00:17.640> bit<00:00:18.630> of<00:00:18.720> a<00:00:18.779> pain<00:00:18.960> in<00:00:19.050> the<00:00:19.080> butt<00:00:19.260> to<00:00:19.380> get<00:00:19.470> a

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
bit bit of a pain in the butt to get a

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.500 
bit bit of a pain in the butt to get a
nice<00:00:19.710> straight<00:00:20.010> cable<00:00:20.369> run<00:00:20.520> here<00:00:21.180> on<00:00:21.270> the<00:00:21.359> rear

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
nice straight cable run here on the rear

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.330 
nice straight cable run here on the rear
of<00:00:21.539> the<00:00:21.720> bike<00:00:21.900> you<00:00:22.199> know<00:00:22.769> you<00:00:23.010> have<00:00:23.100> to<00:00:23.189> figure

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
of the bike you know you have to figure

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.730 
of the bike you know you have to figure
out<00:00:23.519> how<00:00:23.939> do<00:00:24.000> you<00:00:24.150> anchor<00:00:24.449> your<00:00:24.600> cable<00:00:24.990> some

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
out how do you anchor your cable some

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.800 
out how do you anchor your cable some
bikes<00:00:25.949> have<00:00:26.189> these<00:00:26.760> you<00:00:27.060> know<00:00:27.090> hangers<00:00:27.539> built

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
bikes have these you know hangers built

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.060 
bikes have these you know hangers built
in<00:00:27.960> here<00:00:28.199> and<00:00:28.349> this<00:00:28.439> is<00:00:28.560> nice<00:00:28.740> it's<00:00:28.890> got<00:00:29.010> a

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
in here and this is nice it's got a

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.890 
in here and this is nice it's got a
little<00:00:29.340> barrel<00:00:30.269> that<00:00:30.420> you<00:00:30.510> can<00:00:30.689> turn<00:00:30.840> to

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
little barrel that you can turn to

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.560 
little barrel that you can turn to
slightly<00:00:31.470> adjust<00:00:31.650> the<00:00:31.949> brake<00:00:32.239> sometimes<00:00:33.239> you

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
slightly adjust the brake sometimes you

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.360 
slightly adjust the brake sometimes you
know<00:00:33.660> bikes<00:00:33.930> don't<00:00:34.320> have<00:00:34.559> something<00:00:34.950> built-in

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
know bikes don't have something built-in

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.150 
know bikes don't have something built-in
so<00:00:35.579> there's<00:00:35.760> a<00:00:36.800> instead<00:00:37.800> there'll<00:00:38.040> be<00:00:38.070> a

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
so there's a instead there'll be a

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.740 
so there's a instead there'll be a
hanger<00:00:38.489> that's<00:00:38.610> attached<00:00:38.940> to<00:00:39.180> your<00:00:39.270> seat<00:00:39.540> post

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
hanger that's attached to your seat post

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.560 
hanger that's attached to your seat post
so<00:00:40.680> what<00:00:40.950> you<00:00:41.040> can<00:00:41.190> do<00:00:41.340> you<00:00:42.030> know<00:00:42.059> you<00:00:42.360> want<00:00:42.510> to

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
so what you can do you know you want to

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:43.910 
so what you can do you know you want to
make<00:00:42.690> sure<00:00:42.719> that<00:00:43.050> you've<00:00:43.559> got<00:00:43.590> a<00:00:43.710> nice

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
make sure that you've got a nice

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:44.450 
make sure that you've got a nice
straight<00:00:44.190> line

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
straight line

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.069 
straight line
I<00:00:44.730> think<00:00:45.090> this<00:00:45.239> cable<00:00:45.570> is<00:00:45.629> probably<00:00:45.840> a<00:00:45.899> little

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
I think this cable is probably a little

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.410 
I think this cable is probably a little
bit<00:00:46.260> too<00:00:46.379> short<00:00:47.129> probably<00:00:47.760> binds<00:00:48.000> a<00:00:48.180> little

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
bit too short probably binds a little

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.529 
bit too short probably binds a little
bit<00:00:48.539> because<00:00:48.690> that<00:00:49.430> stiff<00:00:50.430> stiff<00:00:51.000> bend<00:00:51.270> in<00:00:51.420> it

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
bit because that stiff stiff bend in it

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.410 
bit because that stiff stiff bend in it
but<00:00:52.410> you<00:00:53.100> know<00:00:53.190> things<00:00:53.489> that<00:00:53.670> you<00:00:53.879> can<00:00:54.059> do<00:00:54.210> to

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
but you know things that you can do to

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.369 
but you know things that you can do to
avoid<00:00:54.899> that<00:00:55.190> avoid<00:00:56.190> that<00:00:56.309> sort<00:00:56.460> of<00:00:56.610> thing<00:00:56.789> are

00:00:57.369 --> 00:00:57.379 
avoid that avoid that sort of thing are

00:00:57.379 --> 00:00:59.990 
avoid that avoid that sort of thing are
you<00:00:58.379> know<00:00:58.500> maybe<00:00:59.010> since<00:00:59.280> this<00:00:59.430> angles<00:00:59.760> so

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
you know maybe since this angles so

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.389 
you know maybe since this angles so
steep<00:01:00.390> here<00:01:00.660> maybe<00:01:01.289> running<00:01:01.710> a<00:01:01.800> cable<00:01:02.010> hanger

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
steep here maybe running a cable hanger

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:03.830 
steep here maybe running a cable hanger
from<00:01:02.579> the<00:01:02.760> seat<00:01:02.969> clamp<00:01:03.210> would<00:01:03.449> have<00:01:03.539> worked<00:01:03.719> a

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
from the seat clamp would have worked a

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.719 
from the seat clamp would have worked a
little<00:01:03.960> bit<00:01:04.170> better<00:01:04.229> for<00:01:05.189> this<00:01:05.309> particular

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
little bit better for this particular

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.910 
little bit better for this particular
bike<00:01:05.939> you<00:01:06.180> just<00:01:06.210> have<00:01:06.420> to<00:01:06.510> keep<00:01:07.439> into<00:01:07.680> account

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
bike you just have to keep into account

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.890 
bike you just have to keep into account
the<00:01:08.040> fact<00:01:08.220> that<00:01:08.280> there's<00:01:08.520> no<00:01:08.610> standards<00:01:09.210> with

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
the fact that there's no standards with

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.600 
the fact that there's no standards with
these<00:01:10.049> style<00:01:10.290> of<00:01:10.409> bikes<00:01:10.590> so<00:01:10.920> little<00:01:11.340> things

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
these style of bikes so little things

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.420 
these style of bikes so little things
like<00:01:12.000> you<00:01:12.180> know<00:01:12.210> a<00:01:12.479> straight<00:01:13.439> or<00:01:13.619> cable<00:01:13.979> angle

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
like you know a straight or cable angle

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.760 
like you know a straight or cable angle
or<00:01:14.670> you<00:01:15.090> know<00:01:15.450> more<00:01:15.720> consistent<00:01:16.259> angle<00:01:16.380> going

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
or you know more consistent angle going

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:17.899 
or you know more consistent angle going
down<00:01:16.890> to<00:01:16.979> the<00:01:17.070> brakes<00:01:17.310> it's<00:01:17.490> gonna<00:01:17.580> make<00:01:17.790> a<00:01:17.820> big

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
down to the brakes it's gonna make a big

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.210 
down to the brakes it's gonna make a big
difference<00:01:18.180> other<00:01:18.990> things<00:01:19.409> with<00:01:19.860> your<00:01:19.979> brakes

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
difference other things with your brakes

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.030 
difference other things with your brakes
that<00:01:20.369> you<00:01:20.430> need<00:01:20.580> to<00:01:20.670> do<00:01:21.619> different<00:01:22.619> types<00:01:22.650> of

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
that you need to do different types of

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.010 
that you need to do different types of
rim<00:01:23.250> braking<00:01:23.850> surfaces<00:01:24.360> require<00:01:24.780> different

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
rim braking surfaces require different

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.160 
rim braking surfaces require different
pads<00:01:25.290> this<00:01:26.100> is<00:01:26.159> you<00:01:26.460> know<00:01:26.549> a<00:01:26.580> carbon<00:01:27.090> rim<00:01:27.360> so

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
pads this is you know a carbon rim so

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.109 
pads this is you know a carbon rim so
there<00:01:28.560> are<00:01:28.590> carbon<00:01:29.100> specific<00:01:29.610> brake<00:01:29.820> pads

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
there are carbon specific brake pads

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:31.789 
there are carbon specific brake pads
that<00:01:30.479> are<00:01:30.540> gonna<00:01:30.689> work<00:01:30.869> a<00:01:31.020> lot<00:01:31.140> better<00:01:31.290> because

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
that are gonna work a lot better because

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.499 
that are gonna work a lot better because
it's<00:01:32.070> carbon<00:01:32.430> fibre<00:01:32.610> versus<00:01:32.970> metal<00:01:33.180> obviously

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
it's carbon fibre versus metal obviously

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.660 
it's carbon fibre versus metal obviously
the<00:01:33.960> coefficient<00:01:34.799> of<00:01:34.829> friction<00:01:35.280> all<00:01:35.430> those

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
the coefficient of friction all those

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.010 
the coefficient of friction all those
sort<00:01:35.939> of<00:01:36.030> stuff<00:01:36.150> is<00:01:36.210> gonna<00:01:36.360> be<00:01:36.420> way<00:01:36.720> different

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
sort of stuff is gonna be way different

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.170 
sort of stuff is gonna be way different
so<00:01:37.950> you<00:01:38.369> want<00:01:38.549> to<00:01:38.610> make<00:01:38.729> sure<00:01:38.880> that<00:01:39.030> you're

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
so you want to make sure that you're

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.460 
so you want to make sure that you're
using<00:01:39.210> the<00:01:39.540> right<00:01:39.750> little<00:01:40.079> things<00:01:40.259> like<00:01:40.409> that

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
using the right little things like that

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.069 
using the right little things like that
you<00:01:40.920> know<00:01:41.159> right<00:01:41.369> brake<00:01:42.299> pads<00:01:42.540> and<00:01:42.689> stuff<00:01:42.840> like

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
you know right brake pads and stuff like

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.200 
you know right brake pads and stuff like
that<00:01:43.320> so<00:01:43.649> you<00:01:44.280> can<00:01:44.340> see<00:01:44.579> I've<00:01:44.729> been<00:01:44.850> using<00:01:45.030> the

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
that so you can see I've been using the

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.969 
that so you can see I've been using the
wrong<00:01:45.420> pads<00:01:45.869> on<00:01:46.079> this<00:01:46.200> bike<00:01:46.439> so<00:01:46.710> there's<00:01:46.860> all

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
wrong pads on this bike so there's all

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.460 
wrong pads on this bike so there's all
these<00:01:47.100> weird<00:01:47.820> white<00:01:48.329> marks<00:01:48.810> and<00:01:49.020> stuff<00:01:49.079> on<00:01:49.380> the

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
these weird white marks and stuff on the

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.679 
these weird white marks and stuff on the
on<00:01:49.890> the<00:01:50.700> rim<00:01:50.880> I<00:01:50.909> should<00:01:51.149> probably<00:01:51.270> change<00:01:51.570> out

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
on the rim I should probably change out

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.210 
on the rim I should probably change out
my<00:01:51.750> pads<00:01:52.079> sooner<00:01:52.530> rather<00:01:52.680> than<00:01:52.829> later<00:01:52.979> to

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
my pads sooner rather than later to

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.760 
my pads sooner rather than later to
avoid<00:01:53.610> that<00:01:53.820> but<00:01:54.630> you<00:01:54.750> know<00:01:54.869> just<00:01:55.530> make<00:01:55.680> sure

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
avoid that but you know just make sure

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.709 
avoid that but you know just make sure
you're<00:01:55.920> using<00:01:56.009> good<00:01:56.280> brake<00:01:56.490> pads<00:01:56.729> and<00:01:57.329> a<00:01:57.479> nice

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
you're using good brake pads and a nice

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.990 
you're using good brake pads and a nice
clean<00:01:58.110> straight<00:01:58.619> cable<00:01:58.829> runs<00:01:59.130> anything<00:01:59.909> you

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
clean straight cable runs anything you

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.700 
clean straight cable runs anything you
can<00:02:00.119> do<00:02:00.210> to<00:02:00.329> make<00:02:00.600> your<00:02:00.750> cable<00:02:01.110> run<00:02:01.259> straighter

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
can do to make your cable run straighter

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.420 
can do to make your cable run straighter
and<00:02:01.799> shorter<00:02:02.250> it's<00:02:02.969> gonna<00:02:03.090> be<00:02:03.270> good
