want to go so when you put these on
that's<00:01:16.229> going<00:01:16.409> to<00:01:16.470> go<00:01:16.619> this<00:01:16.860> way<00:01:17.189> so<00:01:17.490> when<00:01:18.210> we

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
that's going to go this way so when we

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.450 
that's going to go this way so when we
put<00:01:18.509> the<00:01:18.630> teflon<00:01:19.080> tape<00:01:19.380> on<00:01:19.619> we're<00:01:20.100> going<00:01:20.250> to<00:01:20.280> go

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
put the teflon tape on we're going to go

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.850 
put the teflon tape on we're going to go
the<00:01:20.610> same<00:01:20.869> we're<00:01:21.869> going<00:01:22.020> to<00:01:22.080> go<00:01:22.200> the<00:01:22.320> same<00:01:22.560> way

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
the same we're going to go the same way

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.580 
the same we're going to go the same way
as<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:23.220> threads<00:01:23.580> are<00:01:23.909> so<00:01:24.720> that<00:01:24.960> if<00:01:25.290> the

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
as the threads are so that if the

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.130 
as the threads are so that if the
threads<00:01:25.890> cut<00:01:26.310> into<00:01:26.820> it<00:01:26.970> it<00:01:27.210> won't<00:01:27.450> peel<00:01:27.869> it<00:01:27.990> off

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
threads cut into it it won't peel it off

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.960 
threads cut into it it won't peel it off
it<00:01:28.350> will<00:01:28.439> be<00:01:28.470> cutting<00:01:28.890> into<00:01:29.070> it<00:01:29.250> the<00:01:29.640> way<00:01:29.670> it's

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
it will be cutting into it the way it's

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.149 
it will be cutting into it the way it's
supposed<00:01:30.270> to<00:01:30.360> go<00:01:30.479> and<00:01:30.840> by<00:01:31.409> putting<00:01:31.710> the<00:01:31.950> tape

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
supposed to go and by putting the tape

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:33.859 
supposed to go and by putting the tape
on<00:01:32.369> it<00:01:32.610> we'll<00:01:32.729> make<00:01:33.030> sure<00:01:33.270> it<00:01:33.360> doesn't<00:01:33.570> leak

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
on it we'll make sure it doesn't leak

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.499 
on it we'll make sure it doesn't leak
and<00:01:34.140> we<00:01:34.650> probably<00:01:34.950> won't<00:01:35.340> need<00:01:35.579> a<00:01:35.909> pipe<00:01:36.240> wrench

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
and we probably won't need a pipe wrench

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.830 
and we probably won't need a pipe wrench
when<00:01:37.229> we<00:01:37.409> come<00:01:38.100> back<00:01:38.280> to<00:01:38.520> put<00:01:38.729> it<00:01:38.790> back<00:01:38.939> on<00:01:39.180> what

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
when we come back to put it back on what

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.840 
when we come back to put it back on what

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
washer inside this portion here that's

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.240 
washer inside this portion here that's
going<00:01:45.299> to<00:01:45.420> replace<00:01:45.780> that<00:01:45.840> so<00:01:46.829> I<00:01:46.860> got<00:01:47.070> the

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
really careful with this because most of

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.030 
really careful with this because most of
these<00:01:59.579> pieces<00:02:00.479> are<00:02:00.869> plastic<00:02:01.469> now<00:02:01.649> it's

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
these pieces are plastic now it's

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.709 
these pieces are plastic now it's
important<00:02:02.490> to<00:02:02.520> get<00:02:02.700> it<00:02:02.850> to<00:02:02.969> thread<00:02:03.270> straight

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
important to get it to thread straight

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.560 
important to get it to thread straight
they<00:02:04.110> are<00:02:04.469> now<00:02:05.340> I'm<00:02:05.640> going<00:02:05.880> to<00:02:05.939> get<00:02:06.390> that

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:12.610 
and I'm going to tighten it up a little
bit<00:02:10.310> it's<00:02:11.209> a<00:02:11.300> pretty<00:02:11.540> slippery<00:02:11.900> that's<00:02:12.379> the

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
bit it's a pretty slippery that's the

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.729 
bit it's a pretty slippery that's the
problem<00:02:12.920> it's<00:02:13.250> it's<00:02:13.700> not<00:02:13.849> that<00:02:13.910> it's<00:02:14.239> that

00:02:14.729 --> 00:02:14.739 
problem it's it's not that it's that

tight it's just slippery and you can't
grip<00:02:17.569> it<00:02:17.750> so<00:02:18.760> put<00:02:19.760> rubber<00:02:20.300> band<00:02:20.629> on<00:02:20.959> it<00:02:21.110> and<00:02:21.680> try

00:02:22.089 --> 00:02:22.099 
grip it so put rubber band on it and try

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:25.119 
grip it so put rubber band on it and try
that<00:02:22.340> again<00:02:22.489> and<00:02:23.000> we<00:02:23.360> can<00:02:23.540> get<00:02:23.780> it<00:02:23.900> okay<00:02:24.410> that

00:02:25.119 --> 00:02:25.129 
that again and we can get it okay that

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:27.369 
that again and we can get it okay that
feels<00:02:25.400> pretty<00:02:25.670> good<00:02:25.940> I'll<00:02:26.690> leave<00:02:26.900> it<00:02:27.019> on<00:02:27.140> there

00:02:27.369 --> 00:02:27.379 
feels pretty good I'll leave it on there

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:28.869 
feels pretty good I'll leave it on there
until<00:02:27.530> them<00:02:27.769> dev<00:02:28.010> I<00:02:28.040> don't<00:02:28.310> need<00:02:28.459> that<00:02:28.670> rubber

00:02:28.869 --> 00:02:28.879 
until them dev I don't need that rubber

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:31.570 
until them dev I don't need that rubber
band<00:02:28.970> so<00:02:29.450> in<00:02:29.660> the<00:02:30.200> end<00:02:30.349> I<00:02:30.560> might<00:02:30.769> take<00:02:31.010> a<00:02:31.250> pair

band so in the end I might take a pair

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:34.150 
band so in the end I might take a pair
of<00:02:31.610> scissors<00:02:31.849> and<00:02:32.150> cut<00:02:32.360> it<00:02:32.390> off<00:02:32.769> okay<00:02:33.769> that's

generously supplied us with three

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:47.530 
generously supplied us with three
washers<00:02:46.370> which<00:02:46.640> is<00:02:46.790> probably<00:02:47.150> what<00:02:47.390> we're

doesn't leak I'll put some teflon tape
on<00:02:58.549> this<00:02:58.760> as<00:02:58.970> well<00:02:59.180> I<00:02:59.480> always<00:02:59.780> go<00:03:00.560> in<00:03:00.739> the<00:03:00.769> same

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890 
on this as well I always go in the same

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:04.059 
on this as well I always go in the same
direction<00:03:01.130> as<00:03:01.940> the<00:03:02.420> thread<00:03:02.780> we'll<00:03:03.500> go<00:03:03.950> around

00:03:04.059 --> 00:03:04.069 
direction as the thread we'll go around

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:06.640 
direction as the thread we'll go around
once<00:03:04.549> to<00:03:04.730> replace<00:03:05.090> that's<00:03:05.840> enough<00:03:06.260> this<00:03:06.590> is

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
once to replace that's enough this is

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:09.610 
once to replace that's enough this is
the<00:03:06.829> end<00:03:07.099> I<00:03:07.280> put<00:03:07.549> the<00:03:07.790> washer<00:03:08.569> in<00:03:08.750> that's<00:03:09.379> nice

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:09.620 
the end I put the washer in that's nice

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:13.900 
the end I put the washer in that's nice
and<00:03:09.860> tight<00:03:10.299> okay<00:03:11.350> yeah<00:03:12.350> we've<00:03:12.590> got<00:03:12.799> one<00:03:13.190> more

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:13.910 
and tight okay yeah we've got one more

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:16.420 
and tight okay yeah we've got one more
washer<00:03:14.389> and<00:03:14.930> we<00:03:15.049> put<00:03:15.260> the<00:03:15.350> washer<00:03:15.829> in<00:03:16.040> if<00:03:16.340> you

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.430 
washer and we put the washer in if you

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:17.800 
washer and we put the washer in if you
look<00:03:16.609> at<00:03:16.730> the<00:03:16.850> end<00:03:17.000> you<00:03:17.209> can<00:03:17.359> see<00:03:17.600> which

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:17.810 
look at the end you can see which

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:19.900 
look at the end you can see which
direction<00:03:18.139> the<00:03:18.590> thread<00:03:18.889> is<00:03:19.040> turning<00:03:19.519> and<00:03:19.730> it

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:19.910 
direction the thread is turning and it

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:22.330 
direction the thread is turning and it
turns<00:03:20.209> this<00:03:20.510> way<00:03:20.690> so<00:03:21.260> we'll<00:03:21.380> put<00:03:21.620> some<00:03:21.650> teflon

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:22.340 
turns this way so we'll put some teflon

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:35.990 
turns this way so we'll put some teflon
tape<00:03:22.639> on<00:03:22.880> there<00:03:24.459> enough

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.610 

then

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
then

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:40.850 
then
now<00:03:38.160> is<00:03:38.310> that<00:03:38.489> easier<00:03:38.879> way<00:03:39.290> okay<00:03:40.290> we'll<00:03:40.500> turn

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:40.860
