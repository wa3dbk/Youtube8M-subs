00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:05.649
 in 1908 we are going to make you a new 

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:07.960
 elevator since I know you are looking 

00:00:05.649 --> 00:00:09.160
 some and well, this is a bit 

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:11.200
 bundled up because you do not know which one to see and 

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:13.240
 you want something quick easy and concrete 

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:15.669
 Well, you're not going to see this elevator that 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:17.530
 It is very very easy, very practical and 

00:00:15.669 --> 00:00:20.800
 easy to build whether you are in 

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:22.450
 survival as the creative and good 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.820
 Well let's start doing what 

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:27.790
 I'm doing an actor here from 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:29.260
 wood or you can use any other 

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:31.750
 wood to me that I like this because it is 

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:33.940
 how clear is good, well, you leave others 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:34.780
 two holes and you make another tower towards 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:37.510
 above 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:39.070
 this means how high it is going to be 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:41.499
 your elevator is worth you can do it 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:43.659
 for whatever you want and earn tumor 

00:00:41.499 --> 00:00:44.920
 it's good to just look at the 

00:00:43.659 --> 00:00:46.569
 video if something you do not understand then 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:49.320
 obviously I would have to give it back 

00:00:46.569 --> 00:00:51.300
 or to use it and we see it again 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.650
 well we go behind the two 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:57.380
 holes we have made and we do other 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:57.380
 Two towers worth up to the top 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:08.340
 a pieces is well worth here and we go up 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:11.080
 As you can see, we obviously match the 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.060
 towers so that it is at the same height 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:17.420
 Y 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:19.900
 now what you are going to do is 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.900
 Y 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:24.530
 a line up again or 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.619
 other rows of the block is fuck like 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:29.630
 I'm hitting this voucher and you break 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:31.970
 other two holes although the ones of cover 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.210
 it does not matter in case you do another 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:35.010
 same 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.990
 in front of what you have done here 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:40.560
 another since another one that stays in two and 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:42.170
 two except back personally is of 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.320
 a block 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:47.990
 of good width as you can see already 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:50.869
 we have this so they stay here four 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:53.840
 and on the sides two and back for just that 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:55.700
 what have we done? 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.679
 what are we going to do now? 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.570
 very easy so pay with the 

00:01:57.679 --> 00:02:00.920
 attention the ideal would be to take that 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:03.829
 water from a lake or something and if you do not 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:06.400
 what I have done and you break both of 

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:08.830
 back and put the water here 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:13.110
 if you see that it falls for or not 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:15.450
 well in fact a little bit more like that 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:18.230
 ok so do not drag us now 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:20.870
 let's put a line here of wood 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:24.200
 and now comes the complicated because it is 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:26.450
 very easy to take a poster and put it 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.849
 on appointment I started from below to the 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:32.799
 left there in the first now there what 

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:35.750
 we leave one and there diagonally zigzag 

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:38.450
 one followed one not like you want but not 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:40.430
 you do that you are some very ceporros 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:43.190
 and you're going to screw it up that it's as if 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:46.860
 they would like to play with the corners like this 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:50.270
 I started from the bottom left 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.270
 that interferes with water 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:03:00.140
 so it's not like that, it's worth checking 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:03.940
 very very easy you are not going to shit 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:06.100
 well then fix 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:09.450
 started in that downstairs that interferes 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:09.450
 with the water as you can see 

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:14.260
 good millions of days and now what 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:16.660
 we have to do it's easy it's the same 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:19.540
 but on the sides for example if in this 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:22.440
 missing a gap always starts in the in 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:25.320
 the next one goes for example here 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:27.930
 You see a gap then to the right to 

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:31.230
 the right we always put the poster 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:33.630
 outside there are now in the next 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:35.190
 there you see that there is no then it is like saying 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:37.770
 come give it to you but take it for ass 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:40.920
 here I want to put it here because not 

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:43.860
 more over there there you see it now it would touch 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:48.080
 there but I always put it at the end 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:51.090
 end there is very easy 

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:52.920
 so do not finish it please 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:55.670
 OK 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:55.670
 A) Yes 

00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:02.590
 As you can see it is sucked 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:03.849
 and it's done in a moment I'm going to leave 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:05.349
 so that you look carefully is not the one 

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:07.720
 some not caught in the trick and 

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:10.050
 the street and do it badly as you do 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:13.600
 it's wrong that we're going to break my heart 

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:15.400
 here you see 

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:19.030
 What do we have to do now? 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:19.990
 that catch the water and throw more and we have 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:23.320
 to fill in the gaps that we have left 

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:26.640
 country there here also here too 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:26.640
 well in zigzag 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:30.639
 you can see the water stays there as 

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:34.139
 punch 

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:34.139
 and you touch the corners 

00:04:34.689 --> 00:04:42.470
 this sucks really easy the 

00:04:37.749 --> 00:04:44.360
 mechanism is this has no more 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:47.690
 but and you see how we can go up 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:49.820
 normal example for up or with a pot 

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:52.310
 so some cut a little bit more 

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:54.140
 but good is not bad and as there 

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:56.480
 spaces because it is taking air and not us 

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:58.950
 we drown so you can do it a lot 

00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:01.140
 higher if you want 

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:03.120
 what I recommend obviously is that 

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:05.750
 you have because we go 1 decree this 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:05.750
 as well 

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:19.100
 for example here we are doing as 

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:20.900
 a terrace is good for when you come with 

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:23.180
 the friends because they tell me go fuck 

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:24.949
 elevator there is nothing upstairs because you do not 

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:26.330
 say no because look look at what you 

00:05:24.949 --> 00:05:29.750
 I put here you put a leather sofa 

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:32.360
 leather and here one also very rustic 

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:36.260
 so you can sit down and take the 

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:38.000
 Ã²mnium you see here we come take tea and 

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:40.070
 He already gives himself a good so stretch like 

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:45.740
 you go for the stein veis trampoline 

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:49.280
 prepare a two and hala 

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:51.139
 Fuck but of course you have to do 

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:52.880
 here as a pool or something because not 

00:05:51.139 --> 00:05:55.009
 mother but where does a meter throw me 

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:57.620
 soil is so crazy that you kill me then 

00:05:55.009 --> 00:05:59.270
 we do not have to make a pool 

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:01.010
 good between them went suddenly in 

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:03.560
 the boat but I did not know how to put it I do not know 

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:06.590
 what is going to happen is some fault and not like that 

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:08.960
 that will not happen, you will be safe 

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:10.669
 you only try and if you can not, it's no longer 

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:12.290
 well let's go decorating it because 

00:06:10.669 --> 00:06:14.120
 I tell you, the key is to decorate it 

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:15.680
 because if you do not remember it, you are left behind 

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:17.780
 and that has done a shit and is not going to 

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:19.340
 like your friends and look no 

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:20.810
 it's both decorating units 

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:23.180
 because look at all the things we have 

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:25.190
 that torches you rest though without 

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:26.780
 flowers come to decorate this a little 

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:28.880
 but we a little bit of flowers other 

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:30.830
 yellow flowers over here 

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:33.350
 you will put roses we have sitting now that 

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:35.920
 is its opening here but that 

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:35.920
 here over here 

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:47.080
 and so we give a touch and it stays like 

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:50.020
 I do not know how people will see it since they do 

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:52.240
 about how pretty is shit 

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:55.180
 I love people because they call 

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:56.590
 attention so you use 

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:58.300
 your imagination decorates it and as 

00:06:56.590 --> 00:07:00.130
 you want and well this is the tutorial of 

00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:02.500
 elevator but that you have liked I have 

00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:04.630
 much more and do not hesitate to vote like this 

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:05.710
 video to help people who say 

00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:07.690
 Hey, yeah, he does an elevator 

00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:10.360
 shit like voices, it's so easy that 

00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:12.340
 you pass this video and you already have it so 

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:14.170
 Nothing I hope you liked and button 

00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:16.590
 like and until another copy me of vigo and
