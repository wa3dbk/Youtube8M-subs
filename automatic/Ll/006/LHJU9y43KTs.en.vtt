there<00:00:06.180> we<00:00:06.720> go<00:00:06.930> through<00:00:07.200> the<00:00:07.290> cornea<00:00:07.740> maybe<00:00:08.430> the

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
there we go through the cornea maybe the

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.610 
there we go through the cornea maybe the
light<00:00:08.790> the<00:00:09.420> light<00:00:09.450> is<00:00:09.750> entered<00:00:10.110> the<00:00:10.230> cornea

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
light the light is entered the cornea

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:17.000 
light the light is entered the cornea
which<00:00:11.000> is<00:00:12.000> that<00:00:12.480> first<00:00:12.840> door<00:00:14.719> inside<00:00:15.719> of<00:00:16.170> this

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
which is that first door inside of this

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:24.100 
which is that first door inside of this
car<00:00:18.000> wash<00:00:18.330> is<00:00:19.340> represented<00:00:20.340> to<00:00:20.910> be<00:00:21.060> the<00:00:21.650> pupil

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:24.110 
car wash is represented to be the pupil

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:28.430 
car wash is represented to be the pupil
because<00:00:26.360> we're<00:00:27.360> inside<00:00:27.810> of<00:00:27.990> something<00:00:28.290> or<00:00:28.410> a

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:28.440 
because we're inside of something or a

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:31.250 
because we're inside of something or a
big<00:00:28.650> hole<00:00:29.180> this<00:00:30.180> thing<00:00:30.390> right<00:00:30.510> here<00:00:30.570> as<00:00:31.140> you

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
big hole this thing right here as you

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.100 
big hole this thing right here as you
can<00:00:31.320> see<00:00:32.149> represent<00:00:33.149> is<00:00:33.210> the<00:00:33.300> iris<00:00:33.629> because

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
can see represent is the iris because

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.750 
can see represent is the iris because
that's<00:00:34.590> the<00:00:34.680> closest<00:00:35.040> thing<00:00:35.129> we<00:00:35.250> could<00:00:35.340> get<00:00:35.489> to

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
that's the closest thing we could get to

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.389 
that's the closest thing we could get to
being<00:00:36.149> around<00:00:36.420> the<00:00:36.870> pupil<00:00:37.230> and<00:00:37.559> I<00:00:37.679> mean<00:00:37.859> it

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
being around the pupil and I mean it

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.009 
being around the pupil and I mean it
moves<00:00:38.670> like<00:00:38.879> the<00:00:38.969> iris<00:00:39.239> no<00:00:39.359> just<00:00:39.570> a<00:00:39.660> different

00:00:40.009 --> 00:00:40.019 
moves like the iris no just a different

00:00:40.019 --> 00:00:44.750 
moves like the iris no just a different
ways<00:00:40.640> and<00:00:42.559> since<00:00:43.559> this<00:00:43.800> car<00:00:44.219> wash<00:00:44.429> will<00:00:44.579> take

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
ways and since this car wash will take

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:50.360 
ways and since this car wash will take
some<00:00:44.940> time<00:00:47.120> the<00:00:48.120> door<00:00:48.480> over<00:00:49.199> there<00:00:49.230> and<00:00:49.620> the

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
some time the door over there and the

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.989 
some time the door over there and the
wind<00:00:50.519> is<00:00:50.879> representative<00:00:51.690> to<00:00:51.929> be<00:00:52.079> the<00:00:52.260> lens

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:52.999 
wind is representative to be the lens

00:00:52.999 --> 00:00:56.299 
wind is representative to be the lens
which<00:00:53.999> well<00:00:54.420> the<00:00:54.539> light<00:00:54.719> will<00:00:54.899> exit<00:00:55.260> oh<00:00:55.530> yeah

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
which well the light will exit oh yeah

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.469 
which well the light will exit oh yeah
like<00:00:56.579> likes<00:00:56.819> it<00:00:56.999> to<00:00:57.569> go<00:00:57.690> inside<00:00:58.050> the<00:00:58.109> eye<00:00:58.260> and

00:00:59.469 --> 00:00:59.479 
like likes it to go inside the eye and

00:00:59.479 --> 00:01:03.290 
like likes it to go inside the eye and
I'll<00:01:00.479> sit<00:01:00.749> in<00:01:00.839> for<00:01:01.109> a<00:01:01.140> show<00:01:01.379> for<00:01:01.620> a<00:01:01.649> second

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
I'll sit in for a show for a second

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:10.080 
I'll sit in for a show for a second
give<00:01:03.480> you<00:01:03.600> a<00:01:03.630> break<00:01:04.370> I'm<00:01:05.370> not<00:01:05.610> come<00:01:05.940> on

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:10.090 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:12.680 

you<00:01:10.719> like

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:12.690 
you like

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:18.390 
you like
the<00:01:13.230> lens<00:01:13.470> is<00:01:13.710> opened<00:01:15.710> five<00:01:16.710> seconds

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:18.400 
the lens is opened five seconds

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:25.910 
the lens is opened five seconds
very<00:01:18.760> fast

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.920 

and<00:01:26.920> we're<00:01:27.220> on<00:01:27.280> the<00:01:27.340> retina<00:01:27.580> that<00:01:28.180> will<00:01:28.720> have

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:28.930 
and we're on the retina that will have

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:33.180 
and we're on the retina that will have
several<00:01:29.799> rods<00:01:30.280> and<00:01:30.520> cones<00:01:31.110> and<00:01:32.110> our<00:01:32.260> depiction

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:33.190 
several rods and cones and our depiction

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:35.530 
several rods and cones and our depiction
of

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:35.540 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:37.230 

d

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:37.240 
d

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:41.039 
d
now<00:01:37.689> light<00:01:37.960> poles<00:01:38.369> represent<00:01:39.369> the<00:01:40.119> rods

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:41.049 
now light poles represent the rods

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:42.780 
now light poles represent the rods
because<00:01:41.770> there<00:01:41.950> are<00:01:42.040> more<00:01:42.250> of<00:01:42.280> them<00:01:42.369> at<00:01:42.670> this

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:42.790 
because there are more of them at this

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:44.149 
because there are more of them at this
particular<00:01:43.060> point

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
particular point

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.099 
particular point
and<00:01:44.369> the<00:01:44.820> mail<00:01:44.969> boxes<00:01:45.359> represent<00:01:45.869> the<00:01:45.929> rads

00:01:46.099 --> 00:01:46.109 
and the mail boxes represent the rads

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:49.790 
and the mail boxes represent the rads
because<00:01:46.590> there<00:01:46.740> are<00:01:46.950> less<00:01:47.640> of<00:01:47.999> that

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:49.800 
because there are less of that

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.270 
because there are less of that
wires<00:01:50.400> here

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
wires here

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.570 
wires here
I'm<00:01:52.580> talking<00:01:52.940> the<00:01:53.060> balls

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:54.580 
I'm talking the balls

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:57.440 
I'm talking the balls
are<00:01:54.970> they<00:01:55.120> light<00:01:55.300> pole

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
are they light pole

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.990 
are they light pole
anyways<00:01:58.289> the<00:01:59.250> wire<00:01:59.460> will<00:02:00.030> be<00:02:00.060> our<00:02:00.270> intern<00:02:00.539> Iran

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:02.000 
anyways the wire will be our intern Iran

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.850 
anyways the wire will be our intern Iran
and<00:02:02.210> the<00:02:02.420> trees<00:02:02.750> represent<00:02:03.110> the<00:02:03.530> Gateway

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:03.860 
and the trees represent the Gateway

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:07.710 
and the trees represent the Gateway
ourselves<00:02:04.400> and<00:02:04.640> the<00:02:04.820> bipolar<00:02:05.330> cells

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:07.720 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.770 

inaccurate<00:02:08.950> ratio

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:10.780 
inaccurate ratio

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:15.020 
inaccurate ratio
and<00:02:11.319> the<00:02:11.950> best<00:02:12.459> analogy<00:02:12.850> come<00:02:13.240> up<00:02:13.330> with

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
and the best analogy come up with

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:21.369 
and the best analogy come up with
driving<00:02:15.810> through

00:02:21.369 --> 00:02:21.379 

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:23.990 

we<00:02:22.379> are<00:02:22.469> now<00:02:22.709> approaching<00:02:22.739> the<00:02:23.400> optic<00:02:23.969> nerve

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
we are now approaching the optic nerve

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.679 
we are now approaching the optic nerve
and<00:02:25.219> both<00:02:26.219> by<00:02:27.209> five<00:02:28.010> you<00:02:29.010> rotate<00:02:29.730> the<00:02:30.480> other

00:02:30.679 --> 00:02:30.689 
and both by five you rotate the other

00:02:30.689 --> 00:02:32.690 
and both by five you rotate the other
nerve

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
nerve

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:38.100

blind spot because there's no more rods
or<00:02:40.900> comb<00:02:41.200> so<00:02:41.560> in<00:02:41.710> our<00:02:41.770> case<00:02:41.890> no<00:02:42.460> boxes<00:02:42.910> or

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000

this car falls all the way back here is

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:22.020 
this car falls all the way back here is
really<00:03:19.930> creeping<00:03:20.170> us<00:03:20.410> out<00:03:20.590> and<00:03:21.130> yeah<00:03:21.760> we<00:03:21.940> don't

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.030 
really creeping us out and yeah we don't

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:23.910 
really creeping us out and yeah we don't
know<00:03:22.180> what<00:03:22.360> exactly<00:03:22.450> doing<00:03:22.930> so<00:03:23.320> we<00:03:23.410> apologize
