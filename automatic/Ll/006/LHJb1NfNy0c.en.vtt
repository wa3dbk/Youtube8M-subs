00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.179 
test seems like great weekend for
writing<00:00:17.880> and<00:00:18.500> the<00:00:19.500> road<00:00:19.680> looks<00:00:19.890> like<00:00:20.039> it's

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
writing and the road looks like it's

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:21.679 
writing and the road looks like it's
pretty<00:00:20.310> fun<00:00:20.609> I've<00:00:20.850> driven<00:00:21.029> it<00:00:21.240> before<00:00:21.270> in<00:00:21.630> a

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
pretty fun I've driven it before in a

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:23.840 
pretty fun I've driven it before in a
car<00:00:21.869> hoping<00:00:22.800> it'll<00:00:22.980> be<00:00:23.070> a<00:00:23.189> totally<00:00:23.519> different

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
car hoping it'll be a totally different

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.960 
car hoping it'll be a totally different
experience<00:00:24.300> on<00:00:24.900> a<00:00:24.930> bike<00:00:25.519> I've<00:00:26.519> written<00:00:26.789> this

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
experience on a bike I've written this

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.660 
experience on a bike I've written this
on<00:00:27.150> a<00:00:27.180> bike<00:00:27.449> so<00:00:27.990> I<00:00:28.289> I'm<00:00:28.710> at<00:00:28.859> least<00:00:29.070> I<00:00:29.250> know<00:00:29.310> what

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
on a bike so I I'm at least I know what

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.519 
on a bike so I I'm at least I know what
the<00:00:29.849> turns<00:00:30.630> are<00:00:30.840> like<00:00:30.960> but<00:00:31.260> it's<00:00:31.380> very

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
the turns are like but it's very

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:32.630 
the turns are like but it's very
different<00:00:31.800> when<00:00:32.009> you're<00:00:32.130> using<00:00:32.279> the<00:00:32.460> engine

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
different when you're using the engine

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.450 
different when you're using the engine
brake<00:00:32.969> versus<00:00:33.480> the<00:00:34.020> brakes<00:00:34.260> on<00:00:34.469> a<00:00:34.500> lot<00:00:35.340> of

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
brake versus the brakes on a lot of

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.400 
brake versus the brakes on a lot of
bicycles<00:00:36.000> I<00:00:36.210> think<00:00:36.630> this<00:00:36.719> is<00:00:36.780> really<00:00:37.050> a<00:00:37.170> chance

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
bicycles I think this is really a chance

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.799 
bicycles I think this is really a chance
to<00:00:37.649> put<00:00:37.890> the<00:00:38.040> msf<00:00:38.520> skills<00:00:38.850> to<00:00:39.180> good<00:00:39.300> use<00:00:39.360> and

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
to put the msf skills to good use and

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.389 
to put the msf skills to good use and
actually<00:00:40.200> get<00:00:40.590> them<00:00:40.710> out<00:00:40.860> in<00:00:41.070> the<00:00:41.219> real<00:00:41.340> world

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
actually get them out in the real world

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.240 
actually get them out in the real world
and<00:00:41.879> see<00:00:42.270> what<00:00:42.390> we<00:00:42.510> can<00:00:42.660> do<00:00:42.890> everything<00:00:43.890> from

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
and see what we can do everything from

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.779 
and see what we can do everything from
the<00:00:44.640> cornering<00:00:45.059> to<00:00:46.100> you<00:00:47.100> know<00:00:47.219> maybe<00:00:47.460> if

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
the cornering to you know maybe if

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.459 
the cornering to you know maybe if
there's<00:00:48.000> something<00:00:48.329> in<00:00:48.539> the<00:00:48.629> road<00:00:48.750> swerving

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
there's something in the road swerving

00:00:49.469 --> 00:01:01.940 
there's something in the road swerving
hopefully<00:00:49.950> not<00:00:50.129> for<00:00:50.160> a<00:00:50.430> car

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:01.950 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:04.049 

since<00:01:02.950> I<00:01:03.040> haven't<00:01:03.250> ridden<00:01:03.580> on<00:01:03.730> the<00:01:03.790> dirt

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:04.059 
since I haven't ridden on the dirt

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:06.330 
since I haven't ridden on the dirt
that's<00:01:04.330> the<00:01:04.600> one<00:01:04.750> thing<00:01:04.960> I'm<00:01:05.200> going<00:01:06.070> to<00:01:06.130> try

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:06.340 
that's the one thing I'm going to try

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:08.730 
that's the one thing I'm going to try
not<00:01:06.520> to<00:01:06.670> be<00:01:06.790> apprehensive<00:01:07.090> about<00:01:07.530> none<00:01:08.530> of<00:01:08.650> us

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:08.740 
not to be apprehensive about none of us

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:10.620 
not to be apprehensive about none of us
have<00:01:08.860> written<00:01:09.010> on<00:01:09.100> the<00:01:09.190> dirt<00:01:09.310> but<00:01:09.520> I'm<00:01:09.670> not<00:01:09.850> too

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:10.630 
have written on the dirt but I'm not too

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:12.510 
have written on the dirt but I'm not too
scared<00:01:10.960> about<00:01:11.230> it<00:01:11.470> i've<00:01:11.560> ridden<00:01:11.950> ridden<00:01:12.310> a<00:01:12.370> lot

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:12.520 
scared about it i've ridden ridden a lot

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:15.150 
scared about it i've ridden ridden a lot
on<00:01:12.700> a<00:01:12.730> mountain<00:01:13.330> bike<00:01:13.360> and<00:01:13.930> I<00:01:14.740> think<00:01:14.920> some<00:01:15.130> of

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:15.160 
on a mountain bike and I think some of

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:17.520 
on a mountain bike and I think some of
the<00:01:15.310> same<00:01:15.490> principles<00:01:16.060> will<00:01:16.210> apply<00:01:16.240> so<00:01:16.960> I

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:17.530 
the same principles will apply so I

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:19.740 
the same principles will apply so I
guess<00:01:17.950> we'll<00:01:18.280> just<00:01:18.340> have<00:01:18.550> to<00:01:18.670> wait<00:01:18.880> and<00:01:18.940> see<00:01:19.150> no

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:19.750 
guess we'll just have to wait and see no

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:22.200 
guess we'll just have to wait and see no
breaking<00:01:20.200> quickly<00:01:20.740> no<00:01:21.160> quick<00:01:21.640> transitions

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:22.210 
breaking quickly no quick transitions

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:24.480 
breaking quickly no quick transitions
and<00:01:22.450> the<00:01:22.510> dirt<00:01:22.660> kind<00:01:23.140> of<00:01:23.200> excited<00:01:23.530> to<00:01:23.590> see<00:01:23.740> how

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:24.490 
and the dirt kind of excited to see how

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:26.850 
and the dirt kind of excited to see how
my<00:01:24.640> skills<00:01:24.970> match<00:01:25.690> up<00:01:25.900> it<00:01:26.530> doesn't<00:01:26.800> really

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:26.860 
my skills match up it doesn't really

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:29.100 
my skills match up it doesn't really
feel<00:01:26.980> like<00:01:27.160> a<00:01:27.340> competition<00:01:27.760> and<00:01:28.180> you<00:01:28.990> know

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:29.110 
feel like a competition and you know

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:30.420 
feel like a competition and you know
what<00:01:29.260> it<00:01:29.350> all<00:01:29.440> comes<00:01:29.470> down<00:01:29.710> to<00:01:29.800> it<00:01:30.070> that's<00:01:30.250> what

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:30.430 
what it all comes down to it that's what

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:32.070 
what it all comes down to it that's what
it<00:01:30.550> is<00:01:30.580> and<00:01:31.180> one<00:01:31.360> of<00:01:31.390> us<00:01:31.540> is<00:01:31.690> going<00:01:31.840> to<00:01:31.930> walk

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:32.080 
it is and one of us is going to walk

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.250 
it is and one of us is going to walk
away<00:01:32.230> right<00:01:32.950> away<00:01:33.010> with<00:01:33.580> the<00:01:33.670> bike<00:01:34.170> it<00:01:35.170> would

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:35.260 
away right away with the bike it would

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.350 
away right away with the bike it would
be<00:01:35.380> so<00:01:35.530> excited<00:01:35.920> if<00:01:35.979> one<00:01:36.160> of<00:01:36.250> these<00:01:36.340> girls<00:01:36.490> you

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:37.360 
be so excited if one of these girls you

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:38.460 
be so excited if one of these girls you
know<00:01:37.479> walked<00:01:37.660> away<00:01:37.780> with<00:01:37.960> a<00:01:38.020> bike<00:01:38.170> and

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:38.470 
know walked away with a bike and

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:40.250 
know walked away with a bike and
eventually<00:01:39.100> we<00:01:39.280> would<00:01:39.400> all<00:01:39.610> right<00:01:39.880> together

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:40.260 
eventually we would all right together

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:44.940 
eventually we would all right together
but<00:01:41.260> if<00:01:41.560> it's<00:01:41.740> me<00:01:41.920> then<00:01:42.520> all<00:01:43.330> the<00:01:43.479> better<00:01:43.950> and

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:44.950 
but if it's me then all the better and

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:46.650 
but if it's me then all the better and
this<00:01:45.369> is<00:01:45.520> where<00:01:45.670> standing<00:01:46.030> up<00:01:46.150> really<00:01:46.420> comes

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:46.660 
this is where standing up really comes

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:48.990 
this is where standing up really comes
in<00:01:46.840> handy<00:01:47.050> is<00:01:47.530> going<00:01:47.770> up<00:01:47.920> the<00:01:48.070> hill<00:01:48.220> and<00:01:48.400> lean

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:49.000 
in handy is going up the hill and lean

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.760 
in handy is going up the hill and lean
forward<00:01:49.540> and<00:01:49.750> get<00:01:50.260> on<00:01:50.380> the<00:01:50.410> balls<00:01:50.619> of<00:01:50.710> your

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:50.770 
forward and get on the balls of your

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:52.560 
forward and get on the balls of your
feet<00:01:50.860> and<00:01:51.220> just<00:01:51.460> lean<00:01:51.670> over<00:01:51.700> that<00:01:52.060> tank<00:01:52.360> like

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:52.570 
feet and just lean over that tank like

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:54.330 
feet and just lean over that tank like
this<00:01:52.600> then<00:01:53.020> you'll<00:01:53.170> find<00:01:53.470> it<00:01:53.740> well<00:01:53.920> other<00:01:54.130> than

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:54.340 
this then you'll find it well other than

00:01:54.340 --> 00:02:04.440 
this then you'll find it well other than
it<00:01:54.490> gets<00:01:54.670> fun<00:01:54.910> okay

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:07.170 

I<00:02:04.509> think<00:02:05.439> is<00:02:05.560> more<00:02:05.770> challenging<00:02:06.009> to<00:02:06.729> come<00:02:06.969> up

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:07.180 
I think is more challenging to come up

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:10.320 
I think is more challenging to come up
but<00:02:07.719> a<00:02:07.780> scary<00:02:08.170> you're<00:02:08.349> going<00:02:08.560> down<00:02:08.769> I<00:02:09.550> should

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:10.330 
but a scary you're going down I should

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:11.970 
but a scary you're going down I should
think<00:02:10.450> about<00:02:10.629> more<00:02:10.810> things<00:02:10.989> coming<00:02:11.410> up<00:02:11.530> static

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
think about more things coming up static

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:13.470 
think about more things coming up static
staying<00:02:12.250> on<00:02:12.310> the<00:02:12.370> front<00:02:12.550> of<00:02:12.580> the<00:02:12.670> bike<00:02:12.819> staying

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
staying on the front of the bike staying

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.390 
staying on the front of the bike staying
on<00:02:13.540> the<00:02:13.629> pegs<00:02:13.870> I<00:02:14.349> don't<00:02:14.950> really<00:02:15.099> think<00:02:15.280> about

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
on the pegs I don't really think about

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.790 
on the pegs I don't really think about
those<00:02:15.700> things<00:02:15.730> so<00:02:16.090> much<00:02:16.239> going<00:02:16.540> down<00:02:16.800> alright

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
those things so much going down alright

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.290 
those things so much going down alright
but<00:02:18.040> I<00:02:18.069> made<00:02:18.250> it<00:02:18.280> up<00:02:18.459> that<00:02:18.519> hill<00:02:18.790> I<00:02:18.819> stood<00:02:19.239> up

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300 
but I made it up that hill I stood up

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.240 
but I made it up that hill I stood up
make<00:02:19.750> such<00:02:19.989> a<00:02:20.019> difference<00:02:20.230> to<00:02:20.530> stand<00:02:20.920> up<00:02:21.069> like

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
make such a difference to stand up like

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:22.949 
make such a difference to stand up like
that<00:02:21.430> and<00:02:21.489> I<00:02:21.760> kind<00:02:22.000> of<00:02:22.060> hesitated<00:02:22.450> at<00:02:22.660> first<00:02:22.690> I

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:22.959 
that and I kind of hesitated at first I

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:24.089 
that and I kind of hesitated at first I
was<00:02:23.050> like<00:02:23.080> half<00:02:23.319> standing<00:02:23.769> and<00:02:23.950> then<00:02:24.040> I

00:02:24.089 --> 00:02:24.099 
was like half standing and then I

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:25.259 
was like half standing and then I
thought<00:02:24.250> about<00:02:24.310> what<00:02:24.640> you<00:02:24.670> what<00:02:25.030> he<00:02:25.120> said

00:02:25.259 --> 00:02:25.269 
thought about what you what he said

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:27.030 
thought about what you what he said
about<00:02:25.390> your<00:02:26.080> luck<00:02:26.260> is<00:02:26.290> getting<00:02:26.560> really<00:02:26.680> sore

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
about your luck is getting really sore

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.160 
about your luck is getting really sore
you<00:02:27.670> know<00:02:27.819> and<00:02:28.030> I<00:02:28.090> thought<00:02:28.269> okay<00:02:28.660> I<00:02:28.870> gotta

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:47.130 
these in here Laura be sure that you
equalize<00:02:44.799> the<00:02:44.860> weight<00:02:45.459> of<00:02:45.700> the<00:02:46.450> groceries<00:02:46.870> in

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.140

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:48.539 
equalize the weight of the groceries in
your<00:02:47.290> cases<00:02:47.709> so<00:02:47.890> that<00:02:47.920> when<00:02:48.220> we're<00:02:48.340> on<00:02:48.400> the

00:02:48.539 --> 00:02:48.549 
your cases so that when we're on the

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:50.610 
your cases so that when we're on the
dirt<00:02:48.760> it<00:02:48.970> won't<00:02:49.180> you<00:02:49.900> know<00:02:49.989> you<00:02:50.049> want<00:02:50.290> connive

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 
dirt it won't you know you want connive

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:53.280 
dirt it won't you know you want connive
head<00:02:50.860> I<00:02:51.390> think<00:02:52.390> these<00:02:52.480> two<00:02:52.720> bags<00:02:52.930> about<00:02:53.200> the

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
head I think these two bags about the

00:02:53.290 --> 00:03:03.390 
head I think these two bags about the
same<00:02:53.640> weight<00:02:54.640> so<00:02:55.239> I<00:03:01.530> really<00:03:02.530> got<00:03:02.650> to<00:03:02.680> leverage

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:03.400 
same weight so I really got to leverage

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.280 
same weight so I really got to leverage
my<00:03:03.430> weight<00:03:03.790> and<00:03:03.819> use<00:03:04.390> my<00:03:04.569> wait<00:03:04.720> to<00:03:04.930> get<00:03:05.049> it<00:03:05.170> up

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.290 
my weight and use my wait to get it up

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:14.520 
my weight and use my wait to get it up
on<00:03:05.440> the<00:03:05.620> on<00:03:05.799> the<00:03:05.860> stand<00:03:06.790> so

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:16.660 

 your<00:03:15.680> user<00:03:15.860> just<00:03:16.070> believe<00:03:16.400> me<00:03:16.430> in<00:03:16.580> the

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:16.670 
 your user just believe me in the

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:19.810 
 your user just believe me in the
bag<00:03:17.200> you<00:03:18.200> think<00:03:18.410> yeah<00:03:19.250> I<00:03:19.280> guess<00:03:19.490> I<00:03:19.580> could<00:03:19.730> do

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:19.820 
bag you think yeah I guess I could do

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:25.470 
bag you think yeah I guess I could do
three<00:03:19.970> on<00:03:20.120> each<00:03:20.270> side<00:03:21.820> and<00:03:22.820> do<00:03:23.150> the<00:03:23.180> bag<00:03:23.500> yep

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 
three on each side and do the bag yep

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:28.570 
three on each side and do the bag yep
mm-hmm<00:03:26.800> so<00:03:27.800> we're<00:03:27.920> going<00:03:28.010> to<00:03:28.100> be<00:03:28.220> equally

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:28.580 
mm-hmm so we're going to be equally

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:36.509 
mm-hmm so we're going to be equally
balanced<00:03:28.970> here<00:03:29.090> with<00:03:29.240> this<00:03:29.330> water

00:03:36.509 --> 00:03:36.519 

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:38.559 

loadin<00:03:37.519> up<00:03:37.640> and<00:03:37.909> it'll<00:03:38.120> feel<00:03:38.359> a<00:03:38.390> little

00:03:38.559 --> 00:03:38.569 
loadin up and it'll feel a little

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:43.170 
loadin up and it'll feel a little
different<00:03:38.959> I'm<00:03:39.049> sure<00:03:39.819> you<00:03:40.819> load<00:03:41.150> them<00:03:41.299> evenly

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:43.180 
different I'm sure you load them evenly

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:45.759 
different I'm sure you load them evenly
distributed<00:03:44.180> no<00:03:44.750> I'm<00:03:44.930> thinking<00:03:45.349> this<00:03:45.469> site<00:03:45.650> is

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:45.769 
distributed no I'm thinking this site is

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:47.259 
distributed no I'm thinking this site is
going<00:03:45.890> to<00:03:45.980> be<00:03:46.099> heavier<00:03:46.430> so<00:03:46.640> should<00:03:46.790> I<00:03:46.909> put<00:03:47.120> some

00:03:47.259 --> 00:03:47.269 
going to be heavier so should I put some

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:56.259 
going to be heavier so should I put some
sodas<00:03:47.659> on<00:03:47.840> the<00:03:47.930> other<00:03:48.079> side<00:03:48.409> as<00:03:48.560> well<00:03:55.269> already

00:03:56.259 --> 00:03:56.269 
sodas on the other side as well already

00:03:56.269 --> 00:03:58.349 
sodas on the other side as well already
my<00:03:56.930> views<00:03:57.319> I'm<00:03:57.439> not<00:03:57.620> going<00:03:57.739> to<00:03:57.799> open<00:03:58.099> these

think exists it's more writing through
