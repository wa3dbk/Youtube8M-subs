00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:06.630
 Very sorry 

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:10.049
 This time for the first time 

00:00:10.049 --> 00:00:12.280
 This is to join Japan 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:17.199
 While aiming to read the station name of Yamanote Line 

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:20.929
 Yamanote Line 

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:24.039
 There are two routes inside and outside 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:29.349
 In Japan, the left side of the train is basically the same as cars 

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:35.059
 Turn around counterclockwise on the inside, ie on the map 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.750
 Turning clockwise will be the outer circumference 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.480
 The cause of this around statistics is 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:48.250
 It is a roundabout 

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:51.180
 Explain the salary 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.270
 At first there was a person who was the starting point 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:56.570
 From among all 29 stations on the Yamanote Line 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:59.680
 Select and express any human shadow tree 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:02.300
 Ten kilos 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.450
 All participants get 2 degrees 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.750
 I will say the station name of the next person's drawing by another around the statistics 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.020
 Yurakucho 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.020
 I will put my hands on 2 degrees again 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:27.520
 1 point here 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.520
 Overall rhythm is 4 seconds 7 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.340
 It was 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.200
 Let's understand tempo well 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.120
 I found Tenpo 

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:43.180
 I went to the station name other than Yamanote Line 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:47.520
 If you put on the station name and other people went to McKelles net 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:52.930
 Let's do a defeat 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.400
 However 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:10.570
 End 

00:02:15.429 --> 00:02:16.740
 Last 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:19.409
 It may be a challenge in the second week 

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:24.010
 I took a moon, but because it is not so, Nagakura-san 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:28.099
 I caught a cold and this mountain is not selected 

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:29.329
 It is a lover 

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:32.489
 Having a good time without contacting your family 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:35.959
 Please do not
