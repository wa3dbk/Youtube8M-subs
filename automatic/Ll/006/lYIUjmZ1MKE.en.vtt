00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.830
 below there is a plane with the vectors and 

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:10.440
 b &amp; w orders the cards according to the 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:13.710
 amount they represent if the card 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:16.020
 does not represent any of the cards 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.420
 must be left unordered of these 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.820
 cards that we have here very well and if 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.550
 you realize here I have the plan and here 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:26.340
 I have my blue color vector 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:30.539
 is my vector come here I have my vector 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:33.030
 w this magenta color is my vector w 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:36.059
 and finally here I have my vector and 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.590
 this purple is my vector um and 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.870
 well let's see what they say 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:47.550
 cards on the left the coordinates 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:48.300
 Cartesian 3 4 ok let's see 1 2 3 and 4 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.920
 up 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:55.590
 1 2 3 4 we arrived just the point where 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.210
 just the vector of and good is that you're 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.850
 Cartesian coordinates can 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:03.030
 represent a vector if we say the 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:06.540
 end point where the vector ends 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:09.360
 point 3.4 and the starting point is the 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:12.360
 origin if the starting point is the origin 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:16.170
 that is, the tail of the vector and the point 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:18.270
 final is point 3 4 ie the head 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.869
 of the vector then we could say that 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:25.259
 the Cartesian coordinates 3,4 this 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:27.360
 point represent the vector b 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:30.479
 another way of looking at it is that vector b 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.580
 goes 3 units to the right of 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:36.090
 horizontal shape while shape 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:39.360
 vertical goes 4 units up and 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:41.759
 therefore this is representing the 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:46.350
 vector b and I'll put it right here 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:48.390
 all right now let's go to 5 on 5 well 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:51.000
 is a number and remember that a number does not 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:53.250
 represents a vector does not represent a 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.830
 vector because although it has magnitude it 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:58.800
 address is needed so it can not 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:02.039
 represent the vector see now here 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:04.800
 down we have the length of vector b 

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:08.220
 therefore 5 maybe it could 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:10.069
 represent the length of this vector b 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.799
 so let's see it 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:16.340
 if it will represent the length of this 

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:19.249
 vector b then this distance should 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:22.040
 of being 5 units and how can we know 

00:02:19.249 --> 00:02:24.260
 if this distance of 5 units good 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.680
 with the Pythagorean theorem if we 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:30.819
 we notice that this side of here is worth 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:33.709
 123 units and this side of here is worth 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:35.629
 1234 then you can tell that 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:39.799
 we have a right triangle of the 

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:42.769
 way 345 these triangles we have 

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:44.750
 seen several times and if you do not remember it 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:48.019
 we can take it out with a theorem 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:50.780
 Pythagoras this side squared stress 

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:53.989
 squared which 9 ok if we add it 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:56.299
 this other side squared which is 4 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:59.900
 squared what gives me 16 

00:02:56.299 --> 00:03:03.859
 this gives me Result 9 +16 which is 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:05.930
 25 what is on this other elevated side 

00:03:03.859 --> 00:03:08.780
 squared and therefore this 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:12.889
 distance if they are 5 units and then 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:16.610
 we can say that if the distance from 

00:03:12.889 --> 00:03:20.360
 origin at point 3.4 are 5 units 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:23.900
 length of vector b are 5 units the 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:27.170
 magnitude of this vector are 5 units and 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:29.810
 Now let's think of a good one if you give 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:32.570
 account one see they look very much like 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:35.870
 fact is a translation of this vector 

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:37.670
 come we moved four units in the 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:41.840
 left and one unit up and 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:43.220
 we have the vector and now what I want 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:45.370
 what you realize is that these two 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:48.170
 Vectors are the same independently 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:50.660
 from where they start what we 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:53.360
 matter is to see what happens from 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:55.610
 the tail of the vector to the head of the 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:58.430
 vector from the initial point to the 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:04:00.980
 end point and if you realize it happened 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:03.290
 exactly the same thing we moved three 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:07.610
 units to the right and we go up 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:09.080
 four units 1 2 3 4 just like in the 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:11.570
 vector t 

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:14.600
 therefore vector 1 and vector b 

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:16.579
 they have the same magnitude and have the 

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:18.769
 same address therefore they are 

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:20.959
 equal vectors so 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:22.850
 regardless of where they start in 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:25.130
 this Cartesian plane these 2 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:28.160
 they represent the same vector and so 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:30.800
 so I'm going to put vector 1 right here 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:34.040
 in my vector b let's lower the 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:36.680
 screen and now the vector is missing w 

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:38.930
 the rector w if you look at this 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:41.630
 vector w let's see what happens from your 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:44.510
 starting point to its end point if you give yourself 

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:47.270
 account we traveled 3 units but this 

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:49.790
 time to the left and 4 units but 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:51.920
 this time down ie rode 

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:54.470
 three negative units on the axis 

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:57.410
 horizontal and four negative units 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:05:00.140
 on the vertical axis and therefore this 

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:03.140
 Vector represents just the version 

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:05.750
 negative vector b and vector 1 

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:08.120
 but that means that it does not represent 

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:10.640
 neither to the vector or to the vector b so 

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:12.740
 both this vector w is going to be left without 

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:14.720
 category is going to be uncategorized 

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:16.790
 because it represents the negative version 

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:19.190
 vector bo vector 

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:21.290
 but it does not represent it as such and 

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:23.900
 then it 's time to check our 

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:27.230
 answer and if we check our 

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:30.190
 answer of the drawing we are fine we 

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:30.190
 we see in the next
