I'd<00:01:44.250> make<00:01:44.399> a<00:01:44.430> solution<00:01:44.820> Wow<00:01:45.390> and<00:01:45.840> we<00:01:46.079> might<00:01:46.350> try

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
I'd make a solution Wow and we might try

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:47.990 
I'd make a solution Wow and we might try
this<00:01:46.740> I<00:01:47.070> don't<00:01:47.280> know<00:01:47.399> I've<00:01:47.490> made<00:01:47.670> him<00:01:47.759> try

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
this I don't know I've made him try

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.940 
this I don't know I've made him try
other<00:01:48.270> concoctions<00:01:49.110> out<00:01:49.259> of<00:01:49.350> the<00:01:49.409> garden<00:01:49.740> and
