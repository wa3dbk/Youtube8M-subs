and<00:00:31.759> obviously<00:00:32.759> if<00:00:33.059> you<00:00:33.270> are<00:00:33.420> the<00:00:33.600> pilot<00:00:34.610> let's

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
and obviously if you are the pilot let's

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.520 
and obviously if you are the pilot let's
face<00:00:35.850> it<00:00:36.090> there<00:00:36.360> will<00:00:36.570> come<00:00:36.840> a<00:00:36.899> time<00:00:37.020> when<00:00:37.500> you

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
face it there will come a time when you

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.479 
face it there will come a time when you
your<00:00:39.410> countermeasures<00:00:40.410> run<00:00:40.710> out<00:00:40.950> and<00:00:41.250> you

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
your countermeasures run out and you

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.090 
your countermeasures run out and you
know<00:00:41.670> you're<00:00:41.910> you<00:00:42.690> are<00:00:42.840> targeted<00:00:43.500> and<00:00:43.770> we'll

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
know you're you are targeted and we'll

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.600 
know you're you are targeted and we'll
definitely<00:00:44.280> get<00:00:45.000> hit<00:00:45.590> well<00:00:46.590> first<00:00:47.250> of<00:00:47.489> all

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
definitely get hit well first of all

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.139 
definitely get hit well first of all
whenever<00:00:48.239> you<00:00:48.600> have<00:00:48.750> popped<00:00:49.050> your<00:00:49.230> ECM<00:00:50.149> which

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
whenever you have popped your ECM which

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:52.700 
whenever you have popped your ECM which
i<00:00:51.300> think<00:00:51.360> is<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:51.660> best<00:00:51.899> countermeasure<00:00:52.559> for

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
i think is the best countermeasure for

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.910 
i think is the best countermeasure for
the<00:00:53.039> helicopters<00:00:53.809> you<00:00:54.809> need<00:00:55.020> to<00:00:55.170> be<00:00:55.320> making<00:00:55.559> a

missile a couple of things will always

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.569 
missile a couple of things will always
happen<00:01:29.840> it<00:01:30.840> will<00:01:31.229> kick<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:31.799> helicopter

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
happen it will kick the helicopter

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.960 
happen it will kick the helicopter
pretty<00:01:32.909> hard<00:01:33.270> and<00:01:33.950> if<00:01:34.950> you<00:01:35.280> take<00:01:35.610> it<00:01:35.640> in<00:01:35.939> the

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
pretty hard and if you take it in the

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.670 
pretty hard and if you take it in the
ass<00:01:36.119> you<00:01:36.780> will<00:01:37.049> definitely<00:01:37.650> knows<00:01:38.340> over

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:39.680 
ass you will definitely knows over

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.520 
ass you will definitely knows over
secondly<00:01:40.680> the<00:01:41.490> rotor<00:01:41.759> will<00:01:42.390> show<00:01:42.659> critical

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
secondly the rotor will show critical

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.410 
secondly the rotor will show critical
damage<00:01:43.799> for<00:01:44.220> a<00:01:44.250> few<00:01:44.520> agonizingly<00:01:45.360> long

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
damage for a few agonizingly long

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.069 
damage for a few agonizingly long
seconds<00:01:46.229> during<00:01:47.100> which<00:01:47.220> time<00:01:47.630> you<00:01:48.630> will<00:01:48.659> lose

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
seconds during which time you will lose

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:53.200 
seconds during which time you will lose
lift<00:01:49.439> and<00:01:49.770> you<00:01:50.159> will<00:01:50.369> be<00:01:50.759> unable<00:01:51.270> to<00:01:51.630> steer<00:01:52.049> and

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:53.210 
lift and you will be unable to steer and

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:57.609 
lift and you will be unable to steer and
start<00:01:54.210> spinning<00:01:54.570> slowly<00:01:55.159> but<00:01:56.159> uncontrollably

00:01:57.609 --> 00:01:57.619 
start spinning slowly but uncontrollably

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:00.920 
start spinning slowly but uncontrollably
to<00:01:58.619> counter<00:01:59.159> this<00:01:59.329> you<00:02:00.329> need<00:02:00.479> to<00:02:00.540> do<00:02:00.780> the

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
to counter this you need to do the

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.340 
to counter this you need to do the
following<00:02:01.320> before<00:02:01.799> getting<00:02:02.340> hit<00:02:02.869> get<00:02:03.869> as<00:02:04.140> much

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
following before getting hit get as much

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.459 
following before getting hit get as much
altitude<00:02:04.680> as<00:02:05.250> you<00:02:05.430> can<00:02:05.700> before<00:02:06.030> the<00:02:06.990> impact

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
altitude as you can before the impact

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:11.790 
altitude as you can before the impact
disables<00:02:08.039> your<00:02:08.280> rotor<00:02:09.349> try<00:02:10.349> to<00:02:10.410> pick<00:02:10.709> out<00:02:10.920> a

disables your rotor try to pick out a

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
a clearing where you will be unlikely to

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.270 
a clearing where you will be unlikely to
hit<00:02:15.190> power<00:02:15.460> lines<00:02:15.910> or<00:02:16.300> what<00:02:16.750> not<00:02:16.990> well<00:02:17.800> out<00:02:18.070> of

hit power lines or what not well out of

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:23.640 
hit power lines or what not well out of
control<00:02:18.760> and<00:02:20.700> most<00:02:21.700> importantly<00:02:22.420> you<00:02:23.290> need<00:02:23.320> to

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
control and most importantly you need to

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:26.640 
control and most importantly you need to
straighten<00:02:24.010> out<00:02:24.370> and<00:02:24.700> fly<00:02:25.210> level<00:02:25.900> at<00:02:26.080> the

straighten out and fly level at the
point<00:02:26.890> of<00:02:27.100> impact<00:02:27.960> this<00:02:28.960> will<00:02:29.200> lessen<00:02:29.470> the

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:29.770 
point of impact this will lessen the

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:31.890 
point of impact this will lessen the
chance<00:02:30.070> that<00:02:30.340> you<00:02:30.490> will<00:02:30.640> nose<00:02:30.940> over<00:02:31.420> and<00:02:31.630> go

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
chance that you will nose over and go

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:35.220 
chance that you will nose over and go
straight<00:02:32.290> into<00:02:32.530> the<00:02:32.680> ground<00:02:33.070> and<00:02:33.930> then<00:02:34.930> you
