00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.420
 I had been in the train for eight hours 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.210
 saturday and i think three tax up 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.590
 the fair was beautiful it has become 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.119
 once again learned really well 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.920
 we went through it on saturday 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.660
 just enough gamescom you connected with 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.669
 battlefield 4 you have the community web 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.200
 already often seen and heard to the 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.170
 now also come in the fall 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.910
 yes patch was autumn patch it 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.620
 equal to a very big stretch the map 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.780
 valley will be even later 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.910
 maybe even in winter 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.250
 patch to come from now is still 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.239
 not known at all but does not matter 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:50.129
 besides, band is always playing here 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.140
 not yet an official end of the support 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.239
 has been posted as reminds us 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.739
 only as long as there is no support end for it 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.780
 There are more updates patches 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.280
 is like at play so speak one 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.890
 whole mechanics all around left right and 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.000
 keep getting new things 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.559
 we deal with 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
 Of course we can report about them 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.530
 can the teamplayer initiative should 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.390
 go further and now again 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.700
 back to the summer patch to come 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.490
 should come in september so to speak 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:21.090
 I'm pretty cool before the fall 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:22.770
 for much less blue title the ct 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.810
 indeed we have the de-community 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.000
 map that is also called jungle map 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.590
 and of course it will continue to be strong 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.180
 polished up and I got you the other day 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.920
 played for a long time and that looks 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.869
 I have to say really good 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.490
 Let's go for a new update 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.600
 or I do not know if it moved that 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.880
 I'm not there right now 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.110
 surely there are some things new again 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.060
 I am definitely going to be made 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.799
 very curious how the whole will be 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.090
 I think that can be really great 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.860
 she is already doing well 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.509
 a lot of fun and if you still 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.119
 can properly polish the really one 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:52.409
 very nice map 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:54.119
 we are curious then again 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:57.750
 graveyard ship this is the night 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:59.850
 variant of 23 11 there is now the 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.920
 anti he is a little yes 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.240
 but in addition to info would definitely 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.399
 to bring in and that was it now 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:10.729
 even to ct and I'll do it right away 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:10.729
 continue with star wars battlefront 3 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.790
 Although the speed bikes would be no 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.980
 power be like the rest 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:19.530
 Vehicles but I can see how 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.000
 normal vehicles like you 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.160
 from battlefield for example knows 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.820
 be used and therefore stolen 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.260
 become 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:27.570
 and they will be completely normal 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:30.030
 work without this power up witnesses 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:33.120
 and I think that's okay too 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:35.490
 star wars battlefront has five ports on 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:38.640
 the gamescom won unbelievably 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:43.320
 applause film yes empire applause insert 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:46.620
 i hope it will be dedicated server 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:48.210
 but there is no server for the game 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.160
 browser that means it will be something like that 

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:51.180
 I run as in the older cod 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.350
 do not like it in the new 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.330
 these days because I'm not 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:55.920
 have played or for example like in 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:57.510
 It's going to be full 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.500
 system will give you 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.480
 probably a few people together 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.370
 you can do and then you will just ever 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.860
 by mode you want to play on 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:06.480
 a random server packed and that time 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:07.770
 as big as the selection has 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.240
 battlefield for example 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:12.240
 and yes, I always compare that with me 

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:14.130
 berti fourth lives kicked people complain 

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:15.239
 always comparison is not always with 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:16.530
 battlefield i can do it too 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:17.820
 minecraft compare there is belief 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.870
 I also have a server browser if you have one 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:24.600
 that's better then I do that 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:25.920
 next time I attack the Werse 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.180
 leaks from the alfa files 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.530
 for example, which are paid players 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:30.390
 became known from the yes 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:32.370
 different modes eg walker salt will be 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:34.590
 to up to 40 people keep playing 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:39.600
 In fighter squadron you can play 20 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:42.780
 against 20.10 against museums with 20 evl 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:47.700
 excuse me here is 20.20 as 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:49.470
 Stark 20 + 20 next Jim is good 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:50.820
 my mistake was my mistake i got myself 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:51.840
 must also tell fathers and 

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:53.100
 I've only seen but they 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:55.530
 so I played on the 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:58.680
 gamescom me for broken sword 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:00.180
 decided and all the 95 percent 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:01.980
 the people also a second rider 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:04.770
 squad and that's a tough word 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:07.290
 fighters later three times in succession 

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:10.560
 Father Scott and from the beginning an opponent 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:12.120
 I do not do that 90 percent of the time 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:14.519
 People who played father's cards 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:15.110
 he was not that impressed 

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:16.130
 but 

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:18.410
 Well , you can do it again your own 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:21.019
 make video game mode blast 20 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:24.110
 people so 20 players supremacy 40 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:26.080
 trabzon 16 hero hand only twelve and 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:28.130
 domination 16 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:29.540
 the maps will be different 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:30.620
 You have to offer that in the daytime 

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:32.270
 the apron already and it should 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:34.700
 various reconnaissance drones and 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:36.800
 viper drove question mark behind it 

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:38.600
 Whatever I do not know 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:41.050
 what are weippert ruins but I have 

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:43.910
 so we have to read and accept 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:45.710
 besides, there were stops in the leaks 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:48.320
 also hints on points tricks 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:50.240
 or killstreaks so that is with 

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:52.400
 to enjoy caution that could be too 

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:55.460
 old rest files are still the ones 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:56.419
 I have included somehow 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:05:01.510
 heard we have a few more 

00:04:56.419 --> 00:05:03.680
 Information about four degrees was correct 

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:04.970
 So without shit we make us 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:06.200
 Do not make us funny 

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:08.120
 Battlefield 3 does not say that too 

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:09.530
 livestreams always both final I 

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:11.270
 basically very happy but im 

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:13.160
 compared to battlefield 4 we do 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:13.820
 64 server instant full plus 

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:15.440
 queue 

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:17.360
 with the eagle then play always 

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:19.010
 only 15 20 people with that is on the 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:20.750
 pc happens to have, unfortunately, yes definitely 

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:22.520
 If I just do something now 

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:24.919
 There are new ones and be with everyone 

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:26.330
 pc as many weapons we come 

00:05:24.919 --> 00:05:28.640
 they have already shown I believe it 

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:31.220
 new weapons with the robbery dlc is so 

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:33.380
 pretty big the dlc appears 

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:35.360
 of course in september so together with 

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:38.090
 the autumn patch wear summer patch of 

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:39.260
 Battlefield was serious now 

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:43.450
 but promise that actually fits 

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:46.550
 Yes, yes, yes, there are still new ones 

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:48.410
 well that the new maps partly very 

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:50.090
 really should be big in the sense 

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:52.040
 from very big we do not know but 

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:53.810
 it is how to crises on battlefield 

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:58.910
 4 what is big wolbeck now 

00:05:53.810 --> 00:06:01.790
 fiddler so 30 centimeters on absolute 

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:04.430
 and now the best info partially 

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:07.270
 The new weapons will be free for you 

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:07.270
 all available 

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:12.590
 sometimes I think so, yes he will 

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:14.390
 just as we run just before also the 

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:17.180
 here this tommy gun then stop for everyone 

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:19.460
 will be playable and to the other 14 

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:21.080
 years is always okay, too 

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:23.479
 I on my battlefield maneuver since 3 

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:25.190
 you can not all arms so old 

00:06:23.479 --> 00:06:26.540
 you have to play you over the ddr ch 

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:29.510
 is free to play 

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:30.080
 So is indeed in battlefield 4 also so yes 

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:33.500
 that's true 

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:36.230
 that was a very bumpy first episode 

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:38.200
 after the games today have the 

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:41.180
 after-effects yes to play 

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:43.790
 A week later, the goal is exactly right 

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:45.980
 there is not so fluid is yes 

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:51.130
 next week on the canal from the mega 

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:51.130
 course the battle news sequence number 36 

00:06:53.380 --> 00:07:00.950
 which follow now that is suitable 

00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:05.510
 very authentically without alumina very me 

00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:06.920
 I do not have you so long 

00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:08.720
 know next week directly on 

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:10.820
 mega quest channel if the last episode 

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:12.230
 you should have missed 

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:13.760
 also his channel move the link to it 

00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:15.530

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:17.180
 my name is chimpanzee and mega quest 

00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:21.380
 can say goodbye now 

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:24.610
 maybe also that my name is 

00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:24.610
 and I am now
