00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:12.800
 the fear 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:14.000
 fear she is always present it's 

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:16.840
 no there is no workout that makes 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.840
 that we are no longer afraid 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.890
 the course is a way to adapt 

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:35.129
 to the environment that surrounds us so 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:37.739
 all types of architects so I know 

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:39.300
 work techniques by a 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:44.370
 physical training that will me 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:46.739
 to overcome obstacles in 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.750
 done when I'm getting ready it's already I 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.570
 do a reconnaissance of the land so 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.670
 I know exactly the obstacles that I 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.530
 will have to go through and after I get 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.160
 do a physical preparation based on 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.800
 these obstacles 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.030
 but the difference with someone who 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.070
 would not work it's me 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.860
 does a month or two months that I repeat 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.149
 such exercise 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:07.380
 so I 'm doing them two meters from the ground I 

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:10.530
 I'm not planting why now 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.300
 at five meters I will fall but it's 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:16.140
 accumulation of repetitions 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:19.020
 never a confidence massa actually the 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.700
 precision it learns to settle in fact 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:24.770
 in the course especially the under of 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.770
 precision it can play a millimeter 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:31.730
 it's like having something 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:33.100
 instinctively already that allows us to 

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:34.820
 measure 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.330
 it's like someone playing 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.430
 bowling 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:38.810
 it measures page we can pull they 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:40.760
 look at the jack he has a 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:46.100
 sensation effect its movement by 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:47.930
 relation to sensation the accuracy in 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:50.960
 it's true that it's rare that in 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:52.610
 a journey where you really are on the run 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:54.050
 to prosecutions and to make a jump from 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:57.380
 precision but it's a job that's 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:59.479
 important important and essential because 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.810
 that it brings some control that 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:03.570
 teaches us to control 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.640
 it teaches us to be safe and 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.229
 the precision ben that requires a lot of 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.300
 concentration and when we did the 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:10.440
 course he is really stalled we know 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.039
 really what we are able to do to 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.039
 what we can not do
