00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:09.430
 www.adder.com your fish shop 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:15.349
 here we see the leader's fishing stand with 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:17.240
 fishing manu already prepared to make us 

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:19.060
 an exhibition of hand lance is 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.910
 prepared 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:24.310
 to lose 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:26.740
 today we are going to try let's try now 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:29.640
 the covers I love hybrids the street 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:32.750
 which is a well-known cane 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:35.210
 We know a lot but what 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:41.690
 with also from other streets I do not 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:44.110
 I've never used and I think it 's 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:44.110
 good 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:51.329
 man is one of the best known faces 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:54.030
 most sold in the market especially in 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:58.829
 hybrid version our friend humberto 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:01:01.199
 calcium is exactly a greeting for 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:04.019
 berto from here from torremolinos is 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:07.590
 a great fisherman who usually fishes 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.700
 with your brand of course I have 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.000
 that to make a good warning has said 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:14.620
 the ship that's there 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.620
 Be careful, do not go joking 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.860
 perfect 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:25.450
 of course the first thing is this advice 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:28.270
 we always give the fishermen that 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:31.180
 before starting to give them strong 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:32.980
 let's make a haul or even two 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:36.610
 over the weak head we wet the 

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:38.770
 I rig the cane too that I do not 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:41.410
 resents excluding it a lot from 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:43.920
 first hour and always good given 12 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:43.920
 hauls 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:49.820
 to prepare exactly the thread is 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:51.030
 let it get wet a bit more 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:52.840
 soft 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:56.340
 we'll see 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.340
 we are going to squeeze friends 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:18.150
 the truth is that yes we will now make a couple 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:20.300
 of more sets but as you will see that the 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:23.300
 technique of our friend manu is 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:23.300
 Awesome 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.580
 free what you selected gives you enough 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.950
 as of the position 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.660
 It is necessary to say more not that one is 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:47.060
 normally he is not used to 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:47.060
 angling with hybrid rods 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:57.240
 we are launching now 

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:57.240
 rarely as a hybrid street 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:03.740
 and then also that we have a 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.540
 compendium of both things a rod that 

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:09.310
 strong you can hit it hard and 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:09.310
 then it is sensitive at the same time 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:15.340
 but let's record a little from behind 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:15.340
 from behind for what 

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:24.230
 my mother 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:36.250
 what do you think is quite good 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:36.250
 true 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:47.450
 and personal feeling 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:51.530
 I'm going to buy a couple of them 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:58.470
 although many times and it is true that there 

00:03:55.990 --> 00:04:01.400
 have to test the materials for 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:04.689
 convinced some 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:04.689
 of how they really are 

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:11.860
 It really is a cane which 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:14.920
 combines with that you can combine two things 

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:18.100
 fabulously it is an exceptional rod 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:20.940
 to throw and an exceptional rod for 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:23.500
 fish to get fish 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:26.590
 we are used to cane I was paid to 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:29.590
 my life they are very very good for 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:32.569
 launch at the time of fishing and 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:35.270
 leave are a little 

00:04:32.569 --> 00:04:37.759
 more abrupt they are bad but they are 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:40.360
 few reeds have great points 

00:04:37.759 --> 00:04:40.360
 they look very good 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:50.410
 Of course it will be like other 

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:50.410
 marks yes yes yes of course clear 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:58.599
 Please, this is the way it is. 

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:00.930
 tell the movie this do not do it in 

00:04:58.599 --> 00:05:00.930
 home 

00:05:11.009 --> 00:05:14.999
 see how the cane brakes up 

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:16.980
 perfectly is something that is very 

00:05:14.999 --> 00:05:20.240
 important 

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:20.240
 in this type of cast 

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:26.460
 good hand 

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:28.570
 thanks for doing our demonstration and 

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:30.700
 we'll see a next video 

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:32.720
 let's hope that he does like the 

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:35.620
 video and they come to him I like 

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:35.620
 then hand 

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:43.760
