00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.040
 and today the government of the country 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.819
 gathered for an emergency meeting 

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:07.740
 prime minister put in front 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:10.190
 subordinates priority task and 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.870
 make a stir among the population and 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:14.400
 prevent rising prices 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.650
 as it turned out, even ready to go on 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.539
 radical measures for example gas stations 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.240
 If something happens, they will immediately revoke the license. 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.619
 at the same time in each region have already created 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.840
 special operational headquarters 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.359
 these structures will follow closely 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.939
 for pricing business structures and 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.369
 punish particularly entrepreneurial by forwarding 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.660
 the little rat watched as 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:36.800
 executive switched to 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.940
 non-standard mode 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.200
 today all these people are more likely not 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.760
 government representatives 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.800
 high ranking members themselves 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.690
 present crisis headquarters in which 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.820
 literally in a matter of hours turned 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.320
 cabinet after lunch 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.170
 all ministries without exception and 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.850
 agencies have canceled scheduled events 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:56.190
 meeting meetings and presentations of all 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.199
 summoned here to the office of the head of government 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.660
 directly selector video calling also 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.430
 akims of all regions and everything is right there 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.979
 get the task in no case 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.610
 allow price increases and then there is already 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.880
 examples 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:11.100
 unfortunately usually on such days 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:14.659
 certain unscrupulous appear 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:18.229
 Suppliers who believe that if 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:20.460
 devaluations they change currency 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:22.170
 currency change oriented 20 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.970
 percent happened then automatically 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.740
 must also respond price tags this 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:29.100
 not exactly and very important to us 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:33.020
 track unreasonable overpricing 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:34.439
 these days you probably during the whole 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.450
 2014 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:38.220
 special commissions have already created them at 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.470
 each akimat will be closely monitored 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.060
 for price tags in stores and markets 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.710
 special attention to 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.810
 gas station appeared today 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.210
 information that some aziz already 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.490
 raised petrol prices constantly example 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.380
 all price tags are the same but everyone doesn't care 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.969
 warned just try 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:58.200
 any price increase at gas stations will be 

00:01:55.969 --> 00:02:00.540
 responsible reviews with holes 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.130
 by government agencies keep in mind and 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.469
 where it will be unreasonable 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.270
 why the license disappeared from the thing and so sk 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:08.879
 this decision on the activities of these 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.629
 refueling and other companies that 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:12.660
 they relate 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:14.940
 will be solved keep that in mind when 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.620
 this completely exclude price increases 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.540
 it still doesn't work out either 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.099
 perfectly understood by the government in 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.520
 the first will go up import 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:22.379
 products 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.569
 but they say in more favorable conditions 

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:27.090
 will be domestic producers 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:29.280
 of course devaluation will have 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.680
 some effect on price rises 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.900
 since it is important to note here that 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:38.220
 Our goods production for appears 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:39.750
 today an extra chance to substitute on 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:43.349
 the market those goods that today 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:46.650
 imported we will work and how 

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:50.730
 growth of tariffs we invest them in general 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:53.129
 price increases such socially important 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:55.739
 food is specific measures 

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:57.540
 have a stabilization fund at the local 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:03:00.659
 executive bodies all this work 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:03.269
 will be in a complex and create conditions 

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:05.579
 so that price spikes do not occur 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:07.409
 another personal warning 

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:09.120
 made the owner of the exchange points 

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:10.769
 today over the bank took a special 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.959
 ruling on the fluctuation limit between 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:15.090
 buying and selling a dollar can't 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:18.060
 exceed 2 tenge that is, if the exchanger 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:20.180
 buys US currency at 184 then 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:23.129
 get u can sell her maximum by 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:25.980
 186 and the threads we more well, unless of course 

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:27.540
 wants to lose the license and there is one more 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:30.540
 indicator which will be monitored 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:32.639
 literally in daily mode it is the size 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:35.250
 inflation government promised today 

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:37.560
 that it will come at the end of the year for 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:41.010
 previously established limits and will be 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:43.560
 no more than six eight percent times 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:45.799
 rat and Sayat stop metropolitan buraka 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.799
 because
