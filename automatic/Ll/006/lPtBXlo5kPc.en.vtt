00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:01.120 
the training involved lots of chewing
gum<00:01:58.970> and<00:01:59.539> when<00:02:00.200> I<00:02:00.229> came<00:02:00.380> back<00:02:00.770> from<00:02:00.950> the

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.130 
gum and when I came back from the

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:05.490 
gum and when I came back from the
competition<00:02:01.670> I<00:02:01.759> only<00:02:01.909> had<00:02:02.119> five<00:02:02.330> cavities

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:05.500 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.899 

this<00:02:06.500> is<00:02:06.709> what<00:02:06.920> you<00:02:07.039> would<00:02:07.130> call<00:02:07.190> a<00:02:07.580> bubble

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:07.909 
this is what you would call a bubble

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:09.940 
this is what you would call a bubble
blowing<00:02:08.060> meter<00:02:08.390> so<00:02:09.170> this<00:02:09.380> is<00:02:09.530> how<00:02:09.649> you<00:02:09.709> measure

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 
blowing meter so this is how you measure

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:12.789 
blowing meter so this is how you measure
the<00:02:10.190> bubbles<00:02:10.600> I'll<00:02:11.600> show<00:02:11.989> you<00:02:12.080> my<00:02:12.530> biggest

00:02:12.789 --> 00:02:12.799 
the bubbles I'll show you my biggest

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:14.949 
the bubbles I'll show you my biggest
bubble<00:02:13.250> that<00:02:13.580> I<00:02:13.610> blew<00:02:13.850> is<00:02:14.000> 21<00:02:14.360> inches<00:02:14.630> so<00:02:14.840> it's

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:14.959 
bubble that I blew is 21 inches so it's

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:17.470 
bubble that I blew is 21 inches so it's
this<00:02:15.170> big
