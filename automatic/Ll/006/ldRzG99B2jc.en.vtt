marine engine and it doesn't it doesn't

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.390 
marine engine and it doesn't it doesn't
turn<00:00:40.740> over<00:00:42.020> it<00:00:43.020> was<00:00:43.140> advertised<00:00:43.710> as<00:00:44.040> the

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:44.400 
turn over it was advertised as the

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.790 
turn over it was advertised as the
piston<00:00:45.090> being<00:00:45.330> frozen<00:00:45.630> in<00:00:46.020> there<00:00:46.290> and<00:00:46.650> I'm

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
piston being frozen in there and I'm

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.820 
piston being frozen in there and I'm
pretty<00:00:46.980> sure<00:00:47.250> it<00:00:47.400> is<00:00:48.170> turn<00:00:49.170> it<00:00:49.320> a<00:00:49.410> little<00:00:49.440> bit

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:49.830 
pretty sure it is turn it a little bit

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:55.150 
pretty sure it is turn it a little bit
you<00:00:50.040> can<00:00:50.190> see<00:00:50.460> it<00:00:51.350> it's<00:00:52.350> got<00:00:52.620> a<00:00:52.680> u/a<00:00:53.870> crank

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:55.160 
you can see it it's got a u/a crank

00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:02.240 
you can see it it's got a u/a crank
start<00:00:56.360> and<00:00:57.360> it<00:00:57.930> also<00:00:58.110> came<00:00:58.500> with<00:01:01.040> the<00:01:02.040> original

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
start and it also came with the original

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.870 
start and it also came with the original
starter<00:01:03.060> which<00:01:03.570> wasn't<00:01:03.870> attached<00:01:04.379> I<00:01:04.880> don't

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
starter which wasn't attached I don't

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.499 
starter which wasn't attached I don't
know<00:01:05.969> if<00:01:06.090> it<00:01:06.210> works<00:01:06.420> or<00:01:06.600> not<00:01:08.179> there's<00:01:09.179> the

00:01:09.499 --> 00:01:09.509 
know if it works or not there's the

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:13.580 
know if it works or not there's the
exhaust<00:01:11.780> coupling<00:01:12.780> I<00:01:12.929> guess<00:01:13.109> you<00:01:13.289> call<00:01:13.469> this

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
exhaust coupling I guess you call this

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.469 
exhaust coupling I guess you call this
where<00:01:13.859> you<00:01:14.009> mix<00:01:14.189> the<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:14.850> water<00:01:15.060> with<00:01:15.299> the

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
where you mix the the water with the

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.319 
where you mix the the water with the
exhaust<00:01:15.780> in<00:01:16.049> the<00:01:16.140> Marine<00:01:16.380> Engine<00:01:16.710> and<00:01:17.490> she

00:01:18.319 --> 00:01:18.329 
exhaust in the Marine Engine and she

00:01:18.329 --> 00:01:23.149 
exhaust in the Marine Engine and she
moves<00:01:18.570> that<00:01:18.749> way<00:01:20.030> nope<00:01:21.030> goes<00:01:21.420> this<00:01:21.630> way

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
moves that way nope goes this way

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:24.499 
moves that way nope goes this way
it's<00:01:23.280> kind<00:01:23.490> of<00:01:23.579> tight<00:01:23.820> there<00:01:24.090> I<00:01:24.119> guess<00:01:24.359> you

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
it's kind of tight there I guess you

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:30.139 
it's kind of tight there I guess you
gotta<00:01:24.950> wrap<00:01:25.950> things<00:01:26.249> around<00:01:27.439> and<00:01:28.789> all<00:01:29.789> in<00:01:29.969> all

00:01:30.139 --> 00:01:30.149 
gotta wrap things around and all in all

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:32.419 
gotta wrap things around and all in all

00:01:32.419 --> 00:01:32.429 
there's a couple of pieces missing here

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:34.160 
there's a couple of pieces missing here
