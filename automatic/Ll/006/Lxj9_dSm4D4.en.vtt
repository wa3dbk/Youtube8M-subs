 I'll tell you the disease now 

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:08.880
 provokes excessive humidity 

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:11.560
 over 70 percent abundant dew fog and 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:19.030
 fluctuations in day and night temperatures 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:23.079

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:26.920
 here is the prevention of late blight I want 

00:01:23.079 --> 00:01:31.180
 hold your tomato on some 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:33.420
 Tomato plants I discovered here 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:36.420

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.420
 specks 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:46.280
 and in order to warn this fluoride 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:50.060
 I will prepare the solution and sprinkle 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:53.950
 tomatoes but you can shave with this solution 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:57.910
 sprinkle not only tomatoes but also 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:02:01.340

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:04.940
 peddler phytophtora for the prevention and 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.750
 phytophthora can be used chemical 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:08.899
 drugs 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:12.130
 but I do this as a last resort 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:15.020
 When traditional methods do not help and 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:16.780
 from folk methods I want you 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:20.810
 suggest such 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:25.000
 10 liters of water dilute 1 liter of kefir 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:29.800
 add there 20-25 drops of iodine 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:32.660
 you can still make a solution and salt 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:34.630
 ten percent solution for this to us 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:38.690
 need 1 kilogram of salt 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:44.750

 in 10 liters of water and spray the plant 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:03:00.980
 if the plant is very much affected 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:04.269
 so in this case we can 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:08.989
 use one percent solution 

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:13.150
