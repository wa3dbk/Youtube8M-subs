both and if you watched my previous two
videos<00:00:35.270> you<00:00:36.270> know<00:00:36.540> I<00:00:36.570> know<00:00:37.410> some<00:00:38.010> problems

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
videos you know I know some problems

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.369 
videos you know I know some problems
first<00:00:38.879> the<00:00:40.340> unit<00:00:41.340> here<00:00:41.640> was<00:00:41.969> going<00:00:42.329> nuts<00:00:42.660> then

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
first the unit here was going nuts then

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.279 
first the unit here was going nuts then
there<00:00:43.920> was<00:00:44.100> some<00:00:44.340> kind<00:00:44.670> of<00:00:44.730> noisy

00:00:45.279 --> 00:00:45.289 
there was some kind of noisy

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:48.410 
there was some kind of noisy
presentation<00:00:46.289> going<00:00:46.940> hopefully<00:00:47.940> when<00:00:48.270> I

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
presentation going hopefully when I

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.990 
presentation going hopefully when I
floss<00:00:48.780> again<00:00:49.140> moved<00:00:49.410> to<00:00:49.620> a<00:00:49.710> new<00:00:49.890> place<00:00:50.039> but

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
floss again moved to a new place but

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.869 
floss again moved to a new place but
anyway<00:00:51.539> let's<00:00:51.930> just<00:00:52.110> call<00:00:52.379> that<00:00:52.879> everything's

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
anyway let's just call that everything's

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.880 
anyway let's just call that everything's
going<00:00:54.059> to<00:00:54.149> be<00:00:54.210> okay<00:00:54.809> right<00:00:55.230> now<00:00:56.780> this<00:00:57.780> part<00:00:58.710> of

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
going to be okay right now this part of

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:06.440 
going to be okay right now this part of
my<00:00:59.100> series<00:01:00.030> here<00:01:00.359> is<00:01:00.510> going<00:01:00.719> to<00:01:00.840> focus<00:01:05.450> so

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
my series here is going to focus so

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.679 
my series here is going to focus so
let's<00:01:07.229> get<00:01:07.560> going

00:01:08.679 --> 00:01:08.689 
let's get going

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:11.719 
let's get going
in<00:01:09.689> short<00:01:10.110> what<00:01:10.590> we<00:01:10.740> get<00:01:10.950> and<00:01:11.189> then<00:01:11.340> the<00:01:11.490> food

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
in short what we get and then the food

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:18.140 
in short what we get and then the food
is<00:01:11.970> the<00:01:12.240> newest<00:01:13.189> Snapdragon<00:01:15.049> 801<00:01:16.939> chipset<00:01:17.939> so

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
is the newest Snapdragon 801 chipset so

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.630 
is the newest Snapdragon 801 chipset so
it<00:01:18.750> should<00:01:18.990> be<00:01:19.170> slightly<00:01:19.409> faster<00:01:20.250> or<00:01:20.310> slightly

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
it should be slightly faster or slightly

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.410 
it should be slightly faster or slightly
better<00:01:21.630> in<00:01:21.840> terms<00:01:22.110> of<00:01:22.320> CPU<00:01:22.590> performance

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:23.420 
better in terms of CPU performance

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.100 
better in terms of CPU performance
compared<00:01:24.420> to<00:01:24.780> what<00:01:25.229> we<00:01:25.409> had<00:01:25.799> in

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:27.110 
compared to what we had in

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.910 
compared to what we had in
bring<00:01:27.380> us<00:01:27.590> water<00:01:28.040> which<00:01:28.940> was<00:01:29.180> running<00:01:29.920> which

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:30.920 
bring us water which was running which

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.610 
bring us water which was running which
was<00:01:31.190> running<00:01:31.640> since<00:01:32.330> the<00:01:32.450> Snapdragon<00:01:33.050> 800

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:33.620 
was running since the Snapdragon 800

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:35.670 
was running since the Snapdragon 800
rise<00:01:33.890> to<00:01:34.250> an<00:01:34.370> external<00:01:34.670> drive<00:01:34.910> but<00:01:35.450> you<00:01:35.540> know

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:35.680 
rise to an external drive but you know

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:40.080 
rise to an external drive but you know
801<00:01:36.680> in<00:01:37.190> the<00:01:37.310> future<00:01:37.670> should<00:01:38.270> be<00:01:38.300> even<00:01:38.990> better

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.090 
801 in the future should be even better

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:44.469 
801 in the future should be even better
now<00:01:41.090> the<00:01:41.690> GPU<00:01:42.320> aspect<00:01:43.250> of<00:01:43.400> the<00:01:43.490> chipset<00:01:44.000> has

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:44.479 
now the GPU aspect of the chipset has

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:48.780 
now the GPU aspect of the chipset has
also<00:01:44.720> been<00:01:45.020> updated<00:01:45.590> its<00:01:45.890> tutorial<00:01:46.790> 330<00:01:47.740> GPU

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:48.790 
also been updated its tutorial 330 GPU

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:54.790 
also been updated its tutorial 330 GPU
but<00:01:49.790> it<00:01:49.970> said<00:01:50.210> to<00:01:50.390> be<00:01:50.510> 30%<00:01:51.729> faster<00:01:52.729> than<00:01:53.800> the

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:54.800 
but it said to be 30% faster than the

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.690 
but it said to be 30% faster than the
dream<00:01:56.229> Dragon<00:01:57.229> Age<00:01:57.590> from<00:01:57.860> the<00:01:58.040> regular

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700 
dream Dragon Age from the regular

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:04.540 
dream Dragon Age from the regular
version<00:01:59.000> so<00:01:59.840> ya<00:02:01.690> want<00:02:02.920> neutrinos<00:02:03.920> you<00:02:04.340> should

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:04.550 
version so ya want neutrinos you should

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:08.020 
version so ya want neutrinos you should
have<00:02:04.850> booked<00:02:05.240> faster<00:02:06.050> and<00:02:06.860> faster<00:02:07.340> GPU

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
have booked faster and faster GPU

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:10.270 
have booked faster and faster GPU
performance<00:02:08.709> ultimately<00:02:09.709> ultimately

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 
performance ultimately ultimately

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.960 
performance ultimately ultimately
leading<00:02:11.000> to<00:02:11.680> you<00:02:12.680> know<00:02:12.830> much<00:02:13.340> more<00:02:13.550> future

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
leading to you know much more future

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.440 
leading to you know much more future
being<00:02:14.209> device<00:02:14.600> and<00:02:15.580> overall<00:02:16.580> much<00:02:17.180> better

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
being device and overall much better

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:20.979 
being device and overall much better
performance<00:02:18.020> with<00:02:18.470> games<00:02:18.890> and<00:02:19.880> all<00:02:20.090> that<00:02:20.630> kind

00:02:20.979 --> 00:02:20.989 
performance with games and all that kind

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:23.890 
performance with games and all that kind
of<00:02:21.080> heavy<00:02:21.380> stuff<00:02:21.800> so<00:02:22.400> as<00:02:22.790> far<00:02:23.000> as<00:02:23.060> user

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
of heavy stuff so as far as user

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.770 
of heavy stuff so as far as user
interface<00:02:24.650> goes<00:02:25.150> you<00:02:26.150> can<00:02:26.360> see<00:02:26.570> what

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
interface goes you can see what

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:32.860 
interface goes you can see what
everything<00:02:27.170> runs<00:02:27.680> there's<00:02:28.040> no<00:02:28.550> there<00:02:28.880> no<00:02:31.660> no<00:02:32.660> -

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
everything runs there's no there no no -

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:35.289 
everything runs there's no there no no -
no<00:02:33.260> lack<00:02:33.560> interaction<00:02:34.250> there<00:02:34.459> is<00:02:34.610> just<00:02:35.030> some

00:02:35.289 --> 00:02:35.299 
no lack interaction there is just some

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:37.660 
no lack interaction there is just some
slight<00:02:35.570> delay<00:02:36.080> it's<00:02:36.620> not<00:02:36.860> all<00:02:37.100> in<00:02:37.280> the<00:02:37.400> lagg-3

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
slight delay it's not all in the lagg-3

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:42.130 
slight delay it's not all in the lagg-3
but<00:02:38.390> that's<00:02:38.570> perfectly<00:02:39.230> fine<00:02:40.510> very<00:02:41.510> smoothly

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
but that's perfectly fine very smoothly

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.740 
but that's perfectly fine very smoothly
and<00:02:42.620> also<00:02:43.250> keep<00:02:43.430> in<00:02:43.549> mind<00:02:43.850> that<00:02:44.030> this<00:02:44.209> is<00:02:44.269> just

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
and also keep in mind that this is just

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:47.199 
and also keep in mind that this is just
a<00:02:44.870> non<00:02:45.320> final<00:02:45.620> version<00:02:46.280> of<00:02:46.340> the<00:02:46.519> four<00:02:46.760> so<00:02:47.000> the

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:47.209 
a non final version of the four so the

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:51.210 
a non final version of the four so the
retail<00:02:47.600> units<00:02:48.110> when<00:02:48.650> they<00:02:48.890> shipped<00:02:49.340> in<00:02:50.120> March

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
retail units when they shipped in March

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:55.410 
retail units when they shipped in March
the<00:02:52.220> performance<00:02:52.880> might<00:02:53.120> be<00:02:53.360> even<00:02:53.630> filtered

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
the performance might be even filtered

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:58.120 
the performance might be even filtered
so<00:02:56.420> by<00:02:56.780> the<00:02:56.840> way<00:02:57.019> I've<00:02:57.200> run<00:02:57.590> some<00:02:57.830> benchmarks

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:58.130 
so by the way I've run some benchmarks

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:00.850 
so by the way I've run some benchmarks
where<00:02:58.910> this<00:02:59.209> early<00:02:59.660> version<00:02:59.690> of<00:03:00.140> the

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:00.860 
where this early version of the

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:04.030 
where this early version of the
cancion<00:03:01.730> so<00:03:02.360> if<00:03:02.510> you<00:03:02.630> haven't<00:03:02.989> seen<00:03:03.200> them<00:03:03.530> seen

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
cancion so if you haven't seen them seen

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:07.440 
cancion so if you haven't seen them seen
an<00:03:04.250> old<00:03:04.430> lady<00:03:04.700> go<00:03:05.000> check<00:03:05.269> it<00:03:05.420> out<00:03:05.630> yeah

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 
an old lady go check it out yeah

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:10.260 
an old lady go check it out yeah
come<00:03:07.920> but<00:03:08.920> let<00:03:09.099> me<00:03:09.280> continue<00:03:09.520> with<00:03:09.910> my

things that's some very detailed video I

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:27.890 
things that's some very detailed video I
hope<00:03:25.630> you<00:03:25.840> can<00:03:26.019> see<00:03:26.230> through<00:03:26.470> the<00:03:26.590> camera<00:03:26.620> but

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
hope you can see through the camera but

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.540 
hope you can see through the camera but
obviously<00:03:28.900> you<00:03:29.140> see<00:03:29.380> mm<00:03:29.950> I<00:03:29.980> have<00:03:30.190> a<00:03:30.220> problem

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:30.550 
obviously you see mm I have a problem

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:31.440 
obviously you see mm I have a problem
with<00:03:30.970> it

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:31.450 
with it

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:36.059 
with it
no<00:03:31.810> actually<00:03:33.269> I<00:03:34.269> think<00:03:35.080> that<00:03:35.200> there<00:03:35.380> is<00:03:35.530> just<00:03:35.769> a

00:03:36.059 --> 00:03:36.069 
no actually I think that there is just a

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:39.360 
no actually I think that there is just a
slight<00:03:36.130> delay<00:03:37.090> here<00:03:37.569> but<00:03:37.840> I'm<00:03:38.500> gonna<00:03:38.799> add<00:03:39.129> two

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:39.370 
slight delay here but I'm gonna add two

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:42.780 
slight delay here but I'm gonna add two
beautiful<00:03:39.700> this<00:03:40.060> you<00:03:40.390> know<00:03:41.519> preview<00:03:42.519> version

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:42.790 
beautiful this you know preview version

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:45.030 
beautiful this you know preview version
of<00:03:43.180> the<00:03:43.360> software<00:03:43.599> running<00:03:44.470> on<00:03:44.739> this<00:03:44.980> device

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.040 
of the software running on this device

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.490 
of the software running on this device
so<00:03:45.790> you<00:03:45.819> know<00:03:46.090> books<00:03:46.540> and<00:03:46.810> all<00:03:46.930> that<00:03:47.140> kind<00:03:47.380> of

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:47.500 
so you know books and all that kind of

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:49.920 
so you know books and all that kind of
bad<00:03:47.769> stuff<00:03:48.069> they<00:03:48.519> tend<00:03:48.880> to<00:03:48.970> consume<00:03:49.450> a<00:03:49.599> lot<00:03:49.780> of

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:49.930 
bad stuff they tend to consume a lot of

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:52.559 
bad stuff they tend to consume a lot of
memory<00:03:50.290> so<00:03:50.980> hopefully<00:03:51.700> things<00:03:51.970> will<00:03:52.180> be<00:03:52.540> just

00:03:52.559 --> 00:03:52.569 
memory so hopefully things will be just

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:55.080 
memory so hopefully things will be just
fine<00:03:53.170> I'm<00:03:53.440> pretty<00:03:53.860> sure<00:03:54.099> things<00:03:54.640> will<00:03:54.849> be

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.090 
fine I'm pretty sure things will be

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:58.020 
fine I'm pretty sure things will be
running<00:03:55.810> excellently<00:03:56.769> with<00:03:57.400> the<00:03:57.610> retail

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:58.030

running excellently with the retail
version<00:03:58.239> of<00:03:58.739> experiencee<00:03:59.739> -<00:04:00.069> so<00:04:00.970> it's<00:04:01.390> also

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:01.630 
version of experiencee - so it's also

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:05.850 
version of experiencee - so it's also
coming<00:04:02.170> with<00:04:02.290> an<00:04:02.500> abundant<00:04:03.299> amount<00:04:04.299> of<00:04:04.569> RAM<00:04:05.079> so

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:05.860 
coming with an abundant amount of RAM so

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:08.039 
coming with an abundant amount of RAM so
it<00:04:06.040> has<00:04:06.250> three<00:04:06.579> gigs<00:04:06.849> of<00:04:07.150> RAM<00:04:07.390> field<00:04:07.690> and<00:04:07.900> the

00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:08.049 
it has three gigs of RAM field and the

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:10.970 
it has three gigs of RAM field and the
nexus<00:04:08.500> memory<00:04:08.920> which<00:04:09.790> is<00:04:09.819> very<00:04:10.000> very<00:04:10.540> good<00:04:10.690> for

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
nexus memory which is very very good for

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:13.559 
nexus memory which is very very good for
multitasking<00:04:11.980> purposes<00:04:12.670> you<00:04:12.819> know<00:04:13.000> this<00:04:13.420> is

00:04:13.559 --> 00:04:13.569 
multitasking purposes you know this is

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:16.620 
multitasking purposes you know this is

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:16.630 
the milk batsman degree here you can see

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:19.199 
the milk batsman degree here you can see
quite<00:04:16.870> a<00:04:16.930> lot<00:04:17.169> of<00:04:17.380> stuff<00:04:17.620> open<00:04:17.919> or<00:04:18.609> even<00:04:18.910> if

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:19.209 
quite a lot of stuff open or even if

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:21.090 
quite a lot of stuff open or even if
those<00:04:19.450> are<00:04:19.660> some<00:04:19.959> kind<00:04:20.229> of<00:04:20.320> cave<00:04:20.590> your<00:04:20.799> apps

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:26.159 
running in the background I'm pretty
sure<00:04:23.919> that<00:04:24.160> the<00:04:24.400> handset<00:04:25.000> will<00:04:25.570> just<00:04:25.900> go

00:04:26.159 --> 00:04:26.169 
sure that the handset will just go

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:28.350 
sure that the handset will just go
through<00:04:26.470> everything<00:04:26.919> and<00:04:27.370> keep<00:04:27.760> going<00:04:28.000> and

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:28.360 
through everything and keep going and

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:29.550

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:32.320 
due to those three gigs of RAM so we can

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:36.390 
due to those three gigs of RAM so we can
put<00:04:32.560> all<00:04:33.400> those<00:04:33.639> apps<00:04:33.970> and<00:04:34.270> in<00:04:35.139> the<00:04:35.350> round

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:36.400
