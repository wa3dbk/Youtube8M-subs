00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.710
 it's that I 'm still mother denial 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.510

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.160
 I do not like to come 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.600
 you understand the problem is that he 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.000
 are jousts that do not know what 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.279

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.830
 room but in small studio like that 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:31.340

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.340
 it's the fault to whom 

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:51.520

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:02.559

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:04.869
 while I took them to see 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:06.220
 boats it's a miracle for them and they 

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:07.300
 are going to lend to it that they put in their 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.040
 buttocks and they realize that 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:11.290
 it's dirty gold - I think very 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:14.080
 sincerely that it is not 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:15.880
 know the miracle that it's the kids 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:18.100
 who none of that when you have a big 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:20.530
 plan on these kids' accounts of 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:23.400
 boys girls who are nothing but 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:23.400
 beef shit 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:29.250
 and we ate morandini's mother with 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.229
 a chocolate bar and a bunch of 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.500
 salt all from a strawberry 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:36.720
 I swear I want to go can not 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:40.579
 know how and that suddenly comes out of 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.579
 my balls it's upsetting 

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:45.479
 morandini was going to walk 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.610

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.840
 is completely combined with chocolate 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.350
 comes from where he answers you it becomes 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.060
 the incarnation 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.579
 is that we say no to me when 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:56.069
 I hear that I'm desperate to think 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:59.659

00:01:56.069 --> 00:01:59.659
