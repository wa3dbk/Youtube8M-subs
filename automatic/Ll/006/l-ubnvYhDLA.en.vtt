00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.020 
the other Tokyo flash watches they have
a<00:01:54.060> very<00:01:54.420> unique<00:01:54.780> or<00:01:55.409> a<00:01:55.500> very<00:01:55.710> different<00:01:56.219> clock

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
a very unique or a very different clock

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.899 
a very unique or a very different clock
layout<00:01:57.719> or<00:01:58.049> number<00:01:58.590> layout<00:01:58.890> you<00:01:59.460> can<00:01:59.490> change

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
layout or number layout you can change

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.910 
layout or number layout you can change
your<00:02:00.090> time<00:02:00.299> to<00:02:00.600> this<00:02:00.810> cryptic<00:02:01.380> mode<00:02:01.649> and

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
your time to this cryptic mode and

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.700 
your time to this cryptic mode and
basically<00:02:02.759> how<00:02:03.030> you<00:02:03.090> read<00:02:03.329> it<00:02:03.479> is<00:02:03.780> that<00:02:04.170> the

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
basically how you read it is that the

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.370 
basically how you read it is that the
middle<00:02:05.040> portion<00:02:05.250> of<00:02:05.640> the<00:02:06.329> number<00:02:06.719> disappears

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
middle portion of the number disappears

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.369 
middle portion of the number disappears
so<00:02:07.770> right<00:02:07.950> now<00:02:08.099> it's<00:02:08.310> 951<00:02:09.270> and<00:02:09.509> it's<00:02:10.080> pretty

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
so right now it's 951 and it's pretty

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.530 
so right now it's 951 and it's pretty
simple<00:02:10.739> to<00:02:10.920> read<00:02:11.129> it<00:02:11.310> but<00:02:11.879> if<00:02:12.060> you<00:02:12.180> don't<00:02:12.330> like

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
simple to read it but if you don't like

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.760 
simple to read it but if you don't like
this<00:02:12.750> design<00:02:13.230> you<00:02:13.500> can

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
this design you can

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.050 
this design you can
easily<00:02:14.100> switch<00:02:14.370> it<00:02:14.550> back

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
easily switch it back

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:19.140 
easily switch it back
this<00:02:16.959> has<00:02:17.200> a<00:02:17.230> very<00:02:17.620> upscale<00:02:18.040> design<00:02:18.700> I<00:02:19.000> really

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
this has a very upscale design I really

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.290 
this has a very upscale design I really
enjoyed<00:02:19.810> this<00:02:20.080> glass<00:02:20.830> which<00:02:21.310> protrudes<00:02:22.000> out<00:02:22.270> a

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.300 
enjoyed this glass which protrudes out a

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:25.470 
enjoyed this glass which protrudes out a
little<00:02:22.690> bit<00:02:22.930> giving<00:02:23.680> it<00:02:23.860> a<00:02:24.040> 3d<00:02:24.489> effect<00:02:24.610> on<00:02:25.120> the

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
little bit giving it a 3d effect on the

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.630 
little bit giving it a 3d effect on the
time<00:02:25.720> which<00:02:26.410> looks<00:02:26.680> pretty<00:02:26.800> cool<00:02:27.190> as<00:02:27.340> you<00:02:27.520> can

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
time which looks pretty cool as you can

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.910 
time which looks pretty cool as you can
see<00:02:27.849> in<00:02:28.030> this<00:02:28.180> video<00:02:28.360> of<00:02:28.780> course<00:02:29.170> I<00:02:29.500> got<00:02:29.680> this

when<00:02:37.750> this<00:02:37.900> first<00:02:38.140> came<00:02:38.319> in<00:02:38.650> the<00:02:38.739> mail<00:02:38.920> it<00:02:39.190> was

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:39.459 
when this first came in the mail it was

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:41.910 
when this first came in the mail it was
actually<00:02:39.970> too<00:02:40.180> big<00:02:40.420> for<00:02:40.660> my<00:02:40.870> wrist<00:02:41.110> so<00:02:41.769> I<00:02:41.800> took

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
actually too big for my wrist so I took

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.729 
actually too big for my wrist so I took
out<00:02:42.220> a<00:02:42.250> few<00:02:42.519> parts<00:02:42.910> of<00:02:43.120> the<00:02:43.480> wristband<00:02:43.959> and<00:02:44.260> now

00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:44.739 
out a few parts of the wristband and now

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:46.979 
out a few parts of the wristband and now
it<00:02:44.890> fits<00:02:45.010> perfectly<00:02:45.519> on<00:02:45.790> my<00:02:46.000> wrist<00:02:46.239> so<00:02:46.660> overall

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:46.989 
it fits perfectly on my wrist so overall

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:49.590 
it fits perfectly on my wrist so overall
this<00:02:47.290> has<00:02:47.500> a<00:02:47.560> very<00:02:47.890> nice<00:02:48.220> well-built<00:02:49.000> design

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:49.600 
this has a very nice well-built design

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:52.050 
this has a very nice well-built design
and<00:02:49.989> the<00:02:50.260> locking<00:02:50.650> mechanism<00:02:51.250> of<00:02:51.400> the<00:02:51.880> watch

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
and the locking mechanism of the watch

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.020 
and the locking mechanism of the watch
also<00:02:52.510> works<00:02:52.750> very<00:02:52.989> well<00:02:53.170> the<00:02:53.560> entire<00:02:54.250> watch<00:02:54.640> is

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
also works very well the entire watch is

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:57.539 
also works very well the entire watch is
made<00:02:55.330> out<00:02:55.569> of<00:02:55.600> stainless<00:02:56.230> steel<00:02:56.769> on<00:02:57.160> the<00:02:57.400> back

00:02:57.539 --> 00:02:57.549 
made out of stainless steel on the back

00:02:57.549 --> 00:02:59.759 
made out of stainless steel on the back
of<00:02:57.730> the<00:02:57.850> watch<00:02:58.000> you<00:02:58.030> can<00:02:58.420> see<00:02:58.780> some<00:02:59.019> logos<00:02:59.260> and

00:02:59.759 --> 00:02:59.769 
of the watch you can see some logos and

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:02.370 
of the watch you can see some logos and
right<00:03:00.220> below<00:03:00.459> that<00:03:00.489> it<00:03:00.880> has<00:03:01.090> some<00:03:01.599> tiny<00:03:01.840> text

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:02.380 
right below that it has some tiny text

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:05.759 
right below that it has some tiny text
which<00:03:03.130> says<00:03:03.160> that<00:03:03.730> this<00:03:04.150> is<00:03:04.769> water-resistant

00:03:05.759 --> 00:03:05.769 
which says that this is water-resistant

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:07.680 
which says that this is water-resistant
I<00:03:06.010> doubt<00:03:06.610> that<00:03:06.819> you<00:03:06.970> can<00:03:07.060> actually<00:03:07.330> go

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:07.690 
I doubt that you can actually go

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:09.809 
I doubt that you can actually go
underwater<00:03:08.049> and<00:03:08.380> swim<00:03:08.830> with<00:03:09.069> these<00:03:09.310> watches

00:03:09.809 --> 00:03:09.819 
underwater and swim with these watches

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:11.850 
underwater and swim with these watches
on<00:03:10.000> but<00:03:10.480> I'm<00:03:10.569> guessing<00:03:10.810> if<00:03:11.140> you<00:03:11.319> spill<00:03:11.650> some

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:11.860 
on but I'm guessing if you spill some

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:14.190 
on but I'm guessing if you spill some
water<00:03:11.890> on<00:03:12.340> the<00:03:12.489> watch<00:03:12.670> it's<00:03:13.330> not<00:03:13.690> going<00:03:14.019> to

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
water on the watch it's not going to

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.160 
water on the watch it's not going to
take<00:03:14.799> much<00:03:15.250> damage<00:03:15.519> if<00:03:16.060> you<00:03:16.390> are<00:03:16.540> interested

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.170 
take much damage if you are interested

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:18.660 
take much damage if you are interested
in<00:03:17.319> the<00:03:17.440> watch<00:03:17.590> I'll<00:03:17.920> put<00:03:18.069> a<00:03:18.099> link<00:03:18.310> in<00:03:18.549> the
