00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
three four five six two three four five

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.400 
three four five six two three four five
and<00:03:04.170> this<00:03:04.500> one

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410 
and this one

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:12.690 
and this one
which<00:03:06.340> we<00:03:07.060> have<00:03:07.240> six<00:03:08.080> and<00:03:09.810> we<00:03:10.810> wait<00:03:11.350> now<00:03:11.700> which

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:12.700 
which we have six and we wait now which

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:14.910 
which we have six and we wait now which
way<00:03:12.820> is<00:03:12.850> north<00:03:12.940> north<00:03:13.660> is<00:03:13.930> this<00:03:14.200> okay

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:14.920 
way is north north is this okay

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:16.500 
way is north north is this okay
yeah<00:03:15.190> it's<00:03:15.430> that's<00:03:15.610> bad<00:03:15.790> news<00:03:15.820> for<00:03:16.060> me<00:03:16.330> then

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
yeah it's that's bad news for me then

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:18.270 
yeah it's that's bad news for me then
because<00:03:17.050> North<00:03:17.410> is<00:03:17.560> because<00:03:17.890> North<00:03:18.070> is<00:03:18.220> that

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 
because North is because North is that

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.570 
because North is because North is that
way

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:18.580 
way

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:20.520 
way
right<00:03:19.000> so<00:03:19.420> if<00:03:19.540> that<00:03:19.660> means<00:03:19.810> that<00:03:20.020> this<00:03:20.200> has

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
right so if that means that this has

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:24.000 
right so if that means that this has
this<00:03:20.710> today<00:03:21.040> not<00:03:21.400> just<00:03:21.970> on<00:03:22.390> top<00:03:22.630> of<00:03:22.690> the<00:03:23.590> focus

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.010 
this today not just on top of the focus

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:26.040 
this today not just on top of the focus
from<00:03:24.370> before<00:03:24.730> we've<00:03:25.120> matched<00:03:25.300> those<00:03:25.570> we

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:26.050 
from before we've matched those we

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:30.660 
from before we've matched those we
actually<00:03:26.410> have<00:03:26.530> to<00:03:26.650> stack<00:03:28.950> okay<00:03:29.950> and<00:03:30.130> I'll<00:03:30.460> T

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:30.670 
actually have to stack okay and I'll T

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:32.930 
actually have to stack okay and I'll T
so<00:03:30.820> slowly<00:03:31.090> the<00:03:31.270> last<00:03:31.450> one<00:03:31.660> that's<00:03:31.840> the

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
so slowly the last one that's the

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.760 
so slowly the last one that's the
caboodle<00:03:33.940> Bob<00:03:34.090> that's<00:03:34.930> a<00:03:35.140> very<00:03:35.380> complicated

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:35.770 
caboodle Bob that's a very complicated
