 guilty drink that never 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:19.560
 promoted as a symbol of sexual 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:22.080
 revolution figured out Dmitri Tarkhov hands 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.380

 make we owners to protect 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.870
 gay russian don't drink vodka if you're gay 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.059
 such a wave began in the us now 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.980
 sunk to Canada on this street with 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.320
 gay bars in Vancouver vodka removed 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.270
 everywhere here is officially such a measure 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.550
 called unprecedented seriously 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.879
 hinting to sing so she definitely wiped away 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.160
 nose 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.930
 Russian homophobic hope so 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.300
 pressure on russia will be enough 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.370
 so they changed their position and this 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.199
 chicago vodka publicly poured here 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.390
 sewage when in social networks 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.949
 send call support russian gays 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.070
 several owners responded at once 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:07.470
 zucchini gays and lesbians Russia for us 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.960
 not an empty place we worry about them and 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.939
 so we have to do something 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.549
 Russian reaction to what is happening in 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:17.580
 principle predictably that's what they say no 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:19.740
 gay I think they did right to 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:23.189
 dates on the Russian drink vodka because 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:25.830
 what's nothing with her female hands 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.790
 touch our holy vodka understand a 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.680
 here and 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.840
 think they are tempted by the boycott of the West 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.909
 sex brothers who seem to be in their 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:37.320
 support, I think I played here 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:40.700
 purely stereotypical thinking from russia 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:43.439
 vodka is associated moreover brands 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:46.250
 vodka usually stylized under 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:48.770
 Russia therefore this idea 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:51.200
 By the way, but the whale that they do not drink now is gay 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:53.060
 in england or canada to russia does not have 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.190
 almost no relation most 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:57.290
 Rashn vodka from the American counter 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:59.330
 produced in the European Union owners 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:02.030
 brands live in the Baltic States in Luxembourg 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:04.220
 and also steam is killed for gay Russia and 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:05.750
 who ultimately benefit from this you very 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:08.600
 I still do not breathe air 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:11.030
 because hypothetical air along the chain 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:13.580
 all over the world circulating 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:16.430
 and they can breathe the air of those who breathe 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:18.470
 he is in on in russia many western people 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.750
 ideological not to drink russian in social 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:23.270
 networks this action is supported by dozens 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:25.489
 thousand though how not to drink it since 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:27.440
 sexual revolution in the us vodka 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:29.870
 where and drink number one what 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:32.209
 brutal yoba not considered at home in 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:34.220
 America she is exceptionally glamorous years 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:35.989
 already 40 this happened next 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:38.330
 reason 30-40 years ago 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:41.330
 vodka was not a traditional drink 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:44.450
 strong for the market in western culture i 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:47.150
 I think that in connection with this was just 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:49.520
 the choice is made in favor of vodka for 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:50.570
 groups of these citizens this is basically 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:52.400
 Bohemia 

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:54.650
 as a result, in the same social networks already 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.209
 Appeared call to boycott boycott 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:59.180
 sense give Russian vodka 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:01.310
 American game I often am it 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:03.260
 true but if Russian vodka is banned 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:06.410
 I will stay without my favorite drink 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:08.150
 it worries me very much than 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:10.459
 will end the fight with vodka until say 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:12.380
 difficult, however, the United States is a similar boycott 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:13.130
 announced after the sentence of pussy wright 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:15.620
