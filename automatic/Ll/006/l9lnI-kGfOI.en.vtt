00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:05.349
 hello youtube friends this time 

00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:06.920
 let's learn the little things of 

00:00:05.349 --> 00:00:09.140
 prince royce 

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:10.610
 the song has a little one and that the 

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:12.740
 that they have a charge they put in the 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:14.030
 first space of agreement if not also 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:16.400
 You have the option to upload the guitar 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:18.710
 half tone or leave it infa or simply 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:21.020
 what I do, a space will recede 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:22.790
 and they do it imagining that this is not 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:24.350
 because in the end what matters 

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:27.410
 if they learn the song not so much in the 

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:29.480
 tonality of this song we are going to 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:31.010
 divide into two videos remember that this 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.559
 is now who to see the 

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:35.750
 chords the regios only and in the 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:39.190
 next is going to be to see the intro the 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:39.190
 punctures and all that 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:48.890
 but this is only going to see the 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:51.250
 chords and radios so let's go with 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:51.250
 the video 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:58.970
 and good the chords that are used in the 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:01:02.040
 subject are 5 that would be held higher 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:04.390
 you only had greater 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:09.500
 a prayer was older 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:11.390
 I held lower and if that had lower 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:15.340
 enter that groped safe tub stronger 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:15.340
 of 15 seconds during the topic 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:19.640
 and the radios there are two one that is for the 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:22.340
 intro and it would be super slow it would be like that 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:26.740
 it would be three down 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.740
 one up and three down 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.649
 ah 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.850
 Y 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:54.490
 that is a new google with luck in a 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:57.540
 passage of 10 seconds and the second would be 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:02:02.900
 2 down 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:02.900
 2 up and down and up 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:11.760
 then 2 up down up 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:41.960
 in agreement 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.960
 so 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:51.460
 pulse the subject should not have 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:56.550
 complications so good and after the 

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:56.550
 song to go solving your 2 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.349
 ah 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.760
 ah 

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:36.870
 to 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:13.990
 good friends is the whole subject and then 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:16.209
 it keeps repeating it will only change the 

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:18.610
 letter the ingredients complications 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:19.989
 As I told you, I'm going to 

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:22.180
 complement with another video where we go 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:23.290
 in the pointers and in all that so 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:25.060
 I hope that it has served you 

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:27.100
 liked that they leave their score that 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:28.660
