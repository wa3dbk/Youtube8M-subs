00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:05.450
 good morning to all ring of the episode number 25 the world in a different second 

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:09.780
 news from the world of cars we love and something also in the world of motorcycles but 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.490
 we begin immediately with the first service because fiumara presented the model i 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.210
 40 and we see what they said at the press conference 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:20.900
 at the time of presentation 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:24.749
 fabrizio longo, the most beautiful general manager in italy 

00:00:24.749 --> 00:00:31.059
 and carlo sabatini eating for republic editing the Italian dictionary press 

00:00:31.059 --> 00:00:32.610
 first French 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.850
 because it is a choice that if fundamentally imposed by these years of crisis 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:39.140
 if there is a lesson we have all taken 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:43.250
 and that the crisis has adopted this a little in the technical jargon of the one born of 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:47.910
 a says in resizing that has led to both segment changes on 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.990
 lower segment but also engine level the level displacement 

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:52.899
 higher in three thousand for example 

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:55.700
 crushing towards cividate lower level 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:58.910
 this was valid for the whole market I would say for the strong sector 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:02.110
 which is by definition a much more open sector than the private sector also costs 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:06.790
 exercise this temptation this tendency to downsizing has been 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:10.860
 particularly warned then for a car that enters a segment in which 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.480
 more than 60% is the prerogative of the fleet segment the fate fingers and with a 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.640
 Your place is that it is very careful or after toys at total cost of ownership a 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.980
 consumption contact emission used the choice which sky absolutely 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.670
 video confidant 1007 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:27.630
 which among other things in its homogeneity 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:28.509
 the exercise 

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:32.590
 absolutely sure of being able to enter cheap 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:36.070
 well but this is also true in the role of the challenging flight that 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:38.800
 I like very much to get in 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:43.060
 and I assumed ds the challenger must do something new anyway so this 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:46.850
 completeness level also of the actions that we define a bit entry level 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:51.670
 epap one way for a while a figure of presence of the mark via the sign of the 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:56.460
 also of the opening key onda wants to give has a pool of customers than in this 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:57.880
 moment surely 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.180
 because risio montesino answer however renounce also in the versions 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:05.260
 base has content that is sometimes a director's vote 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:10.380
 as they always say upper class say that in this way or we honor 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:13.509
 this new yundai brand positioning 

00:02:13.509 --> 00:02:17.609
 that you absolutely not denying with the coppola generalist pd ben vocation 

00:02:17.609 --> 00:02:22.069
 different from what brands for outdoor express true aladin echo however 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:23.730
 it depends a little more democratic 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.639
 it is more accessible with the offer also of quality ones 

00:02:26.639 --> 00:02:29.909
 and of wealth of contents of notice canossa be the prerogative of 

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:32.179
 cars if not necessarily 

00:02:32.179 --> 00:02:35.099
 from the long and rich coat of arms as they were born before 

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:40.269
 she 40 explicitly explains the new positioning of brenda &amp; key 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:41.010
 wave yesterday 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:45.990
 has realized in 2011 new thinking new possibilities over to try to go 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:50.799
 beyond the conventions try to offer something different and above all 

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:56.129
 if one is a car that can offer so many items it has a price 

00:02:56.129 --> 00:03:01.340
 accessible to all but a quality car of practical and technological style 

00:03:01.339 --> 00:03:05.769
 just like the hyundai i40 which already fits the name in the refined 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:09.959
 style on the winning car on the wave success in these years before 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:12.880
 with her 10 then with her 20 the i30 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:16.130
 and in particular we trust her too 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:20.600
 that we will be able to reach the 5-star euroncap safety and as already pellets 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:24.110
 prices and cars that preceded it in the hyundai e range 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:25.260
 mostly 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.320
 also impure her 40 

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:32.019
 eleva aicon is the new hyundai stylistic language of fluid sculpture 

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:33.959
 that I've already seen realize 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:38.749
 films of great success as the segment sauce is at 35 

00:03:38.749 --> 00:03:44.109
 oh, like the compact ix20 minivan, two cars that were immediately inserted 

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:47.779
 make them the best seller in the new i40 segment 

00:03:47.779 --> 00:03:50.849
 that is on the market today 

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:52.520
 when it is already orderable 

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:56.700
 and will be invented September in the different petrol and 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:59.049
 diesel 4 popul all new ones 

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:00.400
 all euros 5 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:06.349
 1006 gasoline accent 35 horses or 2000 gasoline of 177 horses but 

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:10.260
 above all two new exceptionally balanced icon engines 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:15.349
 extraordinary usability of couples and backs as they say in jargon to all 

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:18.639
 regimes or 1007el turbodiesel 

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:25.319
 dan 100 35 horses or 115 horses as the model of attack let's call it that 

00:04:25.939 --> 00:04:31.340
 three are the classic versions with strong and styles and with the 1006 petrol starting 

00:04:31.339 --> 00:04:33.820
 from 23,000 to 490 euros 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:39.970
 with just a few euros more for the 1007 crd aida 115 horses version yes 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:40.750
 can hold 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:45.060
 also in blue drive version or with start &amp; stop ignition system e 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:49.740
 switch-off at traffic lights when it is not necessary to keep the light on and in 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:53.440
 this case connery sg internet ever stop and go 

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:58.100
 the car is setting new category records because it has some 

00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:59.470
 low emissions 

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:04.930
 in just 100 13 grams per kilometer consumption is also extremely good 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:09.140
 for this car both in the petrol and diesel versions e 

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:12.530
 when you can arrange for it to be a 6-speed manual gearbox 

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:15.980
 that of a new automatic sequential gearbox very relations with 

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:20.740
 torque converter and above all with paddles on the steering wheel that does 

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:24.930
 very sporting also because this car looks very particular 

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:30.130
 indeed we can call it an ebay strain with how brilliant it is in the 

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:33.890
 couple availability both in the determination that expresses even with a sweetness 

00:05:33.889 --> 00:05:38.320
 engine supply that makes it one of its main features 

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:39.400
 that could be 

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:43.180
 truly guided by all of us we obviously turn to an audience 

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:47.610
 vast also because in Italy the segment of which this belongs 

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:52.940
 Berlina is formed mainly by corporate clients rather than by customers 

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:53.720
 private 

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:58.630
 hyundai enters with this car in the competitive fleet market and does so 

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:02.970
 with a machine that wants to create its own space as a protagonist 

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:04.839
 within this segment 

00:06:04.839 --> 00:06:09.050
 also because some elements that are part of the hyundai dna 

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:14.130
 such as the 9 standard airbags plus the best beds 

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:18.110
 and the tcs so much more love between friends that they allow 

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:21.840
 to drive the car safely inail a car that is easily 

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:24.199
 recognizable as all hyundai 

00:06:24.199 --> 00:06:29.150
 if modern and on the grid and hexagonal front, the real distinctive sign of 

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:31.219
 all the hyundai produced 

00:06:31.219 --> 00:06:33.819
 for Europe of developed for Europe 

00:06:33.819 --> 00:06:38.330
 this because there are yundai cars built in europe in this case the 

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:40.150
 car built in Korea because 

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:43.470
 in our establishments dinosaur rights is rather than 

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:48.669
 in turkey smith and where we build ix20 ix35 or turkey teeth 

00:06:48.669 --> 00:06:52.330
 the productive capacity is already at the maximum because fortunately these 

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:54.479
 cars are very successful 

00:06:54.479 --> 00:06:58.779
 since the third car with the new design language of the 

00:06:58.779 --> 00:07:00.409
 fluid sculpture after 

00:07:00.409 --> 00:07:05.150
 the ix35 and the ix20 we hope that also the v 40 

00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:10.120
 arrivals to success is also explicit to a clientele different from 

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:15.400
 the one with care that the house has made explicit in the past months our 

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:18.400
 new brand positioning new thinking new possibilities 

00:07:19.069 --> 00:07:22.409
 she 40 and already orderable from these days has any dealer 

00:07:22.409 --> 00:07:23.510

 headquarters also note the operation commits hyundai if for any reason there 

00:07:43.629 --> 00:07:47.550
 you do not like your new hyundai the more you have time a month 2000 than the mother

 to bring it back to the dealer and you will be fully reimbursed
