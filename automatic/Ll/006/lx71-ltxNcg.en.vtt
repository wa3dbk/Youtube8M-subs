00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:04.500
 hello today there is a do 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.750
 it yourself tip from us we show you 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.610
 how to get a cool yes header 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:12.170
 for the lens can build 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:14.940
 to get a special look into the picture 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:16.410
 Anyone who is wondering how a human has 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.480
 because the master this look already 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.670
 get back into the picture these lights 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.279
 these flairs and so on again 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.380
 that's almost none on camp 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:28.230
 post-processing and that's what it's all about 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.630
 Today these are called anamorphic 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.070
 lens flare you can not only in the 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.260
 Apply video area but also in 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.030
 the photography and how to get involved 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.680
 tinkering that's all right 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.649
 easy and show what looks like 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:44.399
 that we need for this is for example 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:46.770
 such a lens hood sun visor 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:49.050
 or maybe one or the other 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.730
 another old v filter or something like that 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.820
 protector filter or nd filter 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.739
 mode glass broke it and you have 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.289
 now almost this winner of the 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:02.190
 are also good for this then need 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:04.470
 so pearlstrings perlon ropes the 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.210
 There's very cheap in the bastelladen I 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.409
 I still have some left over there you can 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.850
 such pictures are from my 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.390
 last exhibition just left 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.930
 remained 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:16.170
 they are totally clear so perlon stop 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:18.390
 Clearly, acrylics are of great strength 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.330
 the 15 mm so you should already 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.009
 need if you see so thick all 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.530
 Gets the main thing is it 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.420
 In addition , it should be transparent 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.670
 Not be 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:33.360
 and then there is one more from the same 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:36.509
 gallery needs his pictures hook it 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.079
 but also his sons are screwed 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.549
 continue 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.810
 They are also available in the hardware store or on the 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:42.540
 we'll also make a few 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.610
 Put it in the bottom left , where you put the whole thing 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.729
 then you can get a pearl cord 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.409
 costs and then euro fifty meters 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.850
 and the broke here they are once 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:54.509
 in a pack of ten or if you the single 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:56.250
 will cost the plus 12 euros that 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:59.350
 it was a bit of a scissor, maybe 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.549
 still and as always ours 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:02.590
 our battery screwdriver our battery 

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:04.720
 Drilling machine with a small drill 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:07.299
 son of two or three then we want 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:10.149
 Two small holes in the 

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:10.660
 lens hood rows the opposite 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:13.980
 lie 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:17.050
 or just in the broken broken 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:19.000
 protection filter simply yes that is 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:20.500
 Aluminum usually builds there 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.060
 simply by with so universal 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:24.190
 Book or metal as well as 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:27.580
 here the plaster that is quite easy 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:31.050
 and then can easily and so a piece 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:33.519
 be perlon and that here 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:35.410
 like to paste that with different ones 

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:37.209
 tried the best it works 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:39.610
 Of course, with fixed focal lengths have the 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:41.620
 a little less lenses and less 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:43.090
 one has lenses groups at siemens one 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:46.180
 this effect is not quite as strong 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:48.340
 That's why we're back as a favorite 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:51.190
 our super portrait lens taken 50 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:52.840
 mm 18 from canon or nikon or from 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:54.069
 other manufacturers offers itself there 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:57.580
 perfect for 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:03:00.910
 because there you have this anamorphic lens 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:02.890
 flare quasi totally strong as yes 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:05.890
 maybe seen in the video in the beginning 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:07.060
 has maike there with this system 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:10.540
 worked 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:12.670
 And this is exactly what the sun visor blinds 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:14.290
 of 50 millimeters we have for it 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:16.500
 use the screws on it there is 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:19.269
 for under five euros or so in 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:21.040
 Amazon or Panasonic is not now 

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:22.690
 the most stable and not so the 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.340
 most durable because the thread is what you 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:28.510
 on it is only space for our purposes 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:31.660
 but works great died 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:34.109
 look at it and then just ours 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:37.420
 cut perlon is either here 

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:42.220
 push in or simply 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:43.840
 through the sun visor to get out of it 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:47.079
 depending on how big her hole 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:49.510
 you have drilled then screwed 

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:54.160
 ladder or this picture just hook on 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:55.359
 the side attach to the side of the 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:59.109
 side you do not know 

00:03:55.359 --> 00:04:01.540
 and then nothing slips out like that 

00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:04.720
 Curiously , the whole thing is clear 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:07.730
 through the optics and refraction should 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:11.510
 the core and thread of the plan 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:14.060
 stand vertically around then in the picture itself 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:17.389
 to get in horizontal flair 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:19.579
 That would be the first variant of the first 

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:21.290
 Step and if you have the whole thing 

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:23.330
 would like to have a little crazy and so on 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:25.040
 this hollywood movie look even more 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:27.650
 will build you can simply a 

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:29.479
 snap blue pen and that or one 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:31.669
 other color blue actually fits 

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:33.620
 pretty cool so from the movie report goes 

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:35.300
 of course also red green yellow etc 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:36.919
 and with a rather like that 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:38.660
 semitransparent pens erding or 

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:39.949
 we just have a t-shirt here 

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:43.610
 and textile pen taken 

00:04:39.949 --> 00:04:47.030
 color this pet request and already has 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:50.539
 if you have sharp lights like 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:53.530
 example, the lights here behind and the 

00:04:50.539 --> 00:04:57.350
 then take pictures of this blatant 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:59.930
 anamorphic light effect lens flare the 

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:01.940
 whole comes from the film and 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:03.979
 Video technology there are special 

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:06.139
 objective has betrayed me the micron 

00:05:03.979 --> 00:05:07.340
 who have already integrated with the whole 

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:10.639
 which one can produce his effects 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:12.260
 this probably so expensive and with 

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:14.180
 The solution here you can stop then too 

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:17.150
 to realize the whole photographically 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:19.130
 So if you are so portraits photographed 

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:22.400
 yes or just have street photography 

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:24.139
 and all with many lights 

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:25.700
 provided it is just tried it out 

00:05:24.139 --> 00:05:27.919
 There is a pretty cool effect and that 

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:30.169
 whole one can turn synonymous so clear of 

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:31.789
 vertical from the vertical position 

00:05:30.169 --> 00:05:34.370
 here is just the Bavarian flair 

00:05:31.789 --> 00:05:38.570
 but you can also the whole time short 

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:41.300
 make a picture of a photo you can too 

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:44.900
 turn it all diagonally or simply 

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:46.370
 times in the vertical so the bernern 

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:48.680
 thread horizontally 

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:50.470
 your creativity then remains yes 

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:53.440
 no limits set 

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:56.150
 That was our do it yourself tip too 

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:58.789
 Anamorphic lens flare it easy 

00:05:56.150 --> 00:06:01.340
 Built and a very cool movie look 

00:05:58.789 --> 00:06:05.210
 you've tried it out 

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:06.470
 Do you have similar intentions for 

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:08.430
 such an effect just write us 

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:09.750
 below in the comments with purely 

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:10.980
 if you liked the video then 

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:13.290
 is how the thumb up
