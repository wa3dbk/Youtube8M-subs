00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:23.720 
some reason I always like to make sure I

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:28.300 
some reason I always like to make sure I
open<00:04:24.200> this<00:04:24.320> gate<00:04:24.590> because<00:04:26.980> it's<00:04:27.980> going<00:04:28.190> to<00:04:28.250> be

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:28.310 
open this gate because it's going to be

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:39.190 
open this gate because it's going to be
useful<00:04:28.930> just<00:04:29.930> in<00:04:30.080> case<00:04:37.419> you<00:04:38.419> know<00:04:38.540> at<00:04:38.990> this

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:39.200 
useful just in case you know at this

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:44.290 
useful just in case you know at this
point<00:04:39.260> of<00:04:40.100> time<00:04:40.870> being<00:04:41.870> at<00:04:41.990> level<00:04:42.290> 1<00:04:43.300> whether

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:44.300 
point of time being at level 1 whether

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:46.060 
point of time being at level 1 whether
you're<00:04:44.510> playing<00:04:44.720> it<00:04:44.960> the<00:04:44.990> normal<00:04:45.440> way<00:04:45.590> or

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:46.070 
you're playing it the normal way or

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:49.780 
you're playing it the normal way or
doing<00:04:46.790> it<00:04:46.970> this<00:04:47.270> way<00:04:47.770> at<00:04:48.770> this<00:04:48.860> point<00:04:49.250> it's

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:49.790 
doing it this way at this point it's

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:53.500 
doing it this way at this point it's
still<00:04:50.590> it's<00:04:51.590> the<00:04:51.830> same<00:04:52.419> there's<00:04:53.419> no

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:53.510 
still it's the same there's no

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:58.060 
still it's the same there's no
difference<00:04:54.370> not<00:04:55.370> yet<00:04:56.470> the<00:04:57.470> difference<00:04:57.890> will

00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:58.070 
difference not yet the difference will

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:02.920 
difference not yet the difference will
be<00:04:58.100> a<00:04:58.840> little<00:04:59.840> bit<00:04:59.990> later<00:05:00.229> when<00:05:01.690> normally<00:05:02.690> you

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:02.930 
be a little bit later when normally you

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:04.930 
be a little bit later when normally you
would<00:05:03.080> have<00:05:03.110> leveled<00:05:03.560> up<00:05:03.740> except<00:05:04.490> this<00:05:04.669> time

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:04.940 
would have leveled up except this time

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:19.410 
would have leveled up except this time
you're<00:05:05.240> not

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:19.420 

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:25.220 

this<00:05:20.420> guy's<00:05:20.660> pretty<00:05:20.690> easy

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:25.230 

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:36.650 

not<00:05:26.160> much<00:05:26.370> to<00:05:26.610> it<00:05:26.780> fighting<00:05:27.780> him

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:36.660 

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:39.480 

it<00:05:37.660> doesn't<00:05:38.080> do<00:05:38.199> a<00:05:38.229> whole<00:05:38.350> lot<00:05:38.530> of<00:05:38.680> damage<00:05:39.009> and

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:39.490 
it doesn't do a whole lot of damage and

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:42.629 
it doesn't do a whole lot of damage and
even<00:05:40.380> if<00:05:41.380> you<00:05:41.530> get<00:05:41.680> hidden<00:05:41.979> you're<00:05:42.340> not<00:05:42.460> gonna

00:05:42.629 --> 00:05:42.639 
even if you get hidden you're not gonna

00:05:42.639 --> 00:05:48.790 
even if you get hidden you're not gonna
die<00:05:42.960> and<00:05:43.960> you<00:05:44.080> can<00:05:44.259> still<00:05:44.560> take<00:05:44.740> him<00:05:44.919> out

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:48.800 

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:52.899 

but<00:05:49.460> basic<00:05:50.060> strategy<00:05:50.569> here<00:05:51.470> is<00:05:51.500> just<00:05:51.889> a<00:05:52.099> dodge

00:05:52.899 --> 00:05:52.909 
but basic strategy here is just a dodge

00:05:52.909 --> 00:05:58.210 
but basic strategy here is just a dodge
and<00:05:53.360> go<00:05:53.990> back<00:05:54.199> and<00:05:54.409> hit<00:05:54.590> it
