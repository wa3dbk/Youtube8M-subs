aphids down at the base of the leaf

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:19.830 
aphids down at the base of the leaf
they're<00:03:18.040> sucking<00:03:18.939> all<00:03:19.150> the<00:03:19.180> supper

a leaf no it's not going to affect the

00:03:22.389 --> 00:03:25.349 
a leaf no it's not going to affect the
fruit<00:03:22.780> and<00:03:23.739> what<00:03:24.340> happens<00:03:24.670> is<00:03:24.790> the<00:03:24.939> F<00:03:25.060> is

gonna have to do in the winter is
bracing<00:03:35.650> but<00:03:36.190> killer<00:03:36.579> on<00:03:36.790> it<00:03:37.410> another<00:03:38.410> thing

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:38.680 
bracing but killer on it another thing

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.379 
bracing but killer on it another thing
to<00:03:38.799> take<00:03:38.949> good<00:03:39.220> note<00:03:39.519> of<00:03:39.699> is<00:03:39.849> how<00:03:40.030> well<00:03:40.209> my

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:40.389 
to take good note of is how well my

00:03:40.389 --> 00:03:43.349 
to take good note of is how well my
rhubarb<00:03:40.959> is<00:03:41.139> doing<00:03:41.470> this<00:03:41.620> year<00:03:42.120> no<00:03:43.120> honey

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:43.359 
rhubarb is doing this year no honey

00:03:43.359 --> 00:03:45.300 
rhubarb is doing this year no honey
you've<00:03:43.569> done<00:03:43.930> anything<00:03:44.230> different<00:03:44.889> this<00:03:45.040> year

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:45.310 
you've done anything different this year

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:47.819 
you've done anything different this year
to<00:03:45.519> last<00:03:45.699> year<00:03:45.909> but<00:03:46.060> I<00:03:46.209> think<00:03:46.500> this<00:03:47.500> is<00:03:47.680> the

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:47.829 
to last year but I think this is the

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:49.979 
to last year but I think this is the
second<00:03:48.310> year<00:03:48.340> it's<00:03:48.669> been<00:03:48.909> in<00:03:49.180> this<00:03:49.359> place<00:03:49.690> so<00:03:49.959> I

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:49.989 
second year it's been in this place so I

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:52.020 
second year it's been in this place so I
suspect<00:03:50.199> that<00:03:50.440> last<00:03:50.799> year<00:03:51.099> you<00:03:51.340> were<00:03:51.819> just

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.030 
suspect that last year you were just

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:54.599 
suspect that last year you were just
getting<00:03:52.239> used<00:03:52.510> to<00:03:52.659> his<00:03:52.870> new<00:03:53.079> surroundings<00:03:53.609> I'm

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:54.609 
getting used to his new surroundings I'm

00:03:54.609 --> 00:04:01.969 
getting used to his new surroundings I'm
gonna<00:03:54.819> pick<00:03:55.060> a<00:03:55.090> bit<00:03:55.590> maybe<00:03:56.590> have<00:03:56.889> some<00:03:57.099> fatigue

00:04:01.969 --> 00:04:01.979 

00:04:01.979 --> 00:04:04.199 

no<00:04:02.979> it's<00:04:03.159> certainly<00:04:03.609> true<00:04:03.819> that<00:04:03.909> the

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:04.209 
no it's certainly true that the

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:05.580 
no it's certainly true that the
weather's<00:04:04.540> hampered<00:04:04.989> what<00:04:05.169> I've<00:04:05.319> been<00:04:05.409> able

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:05.590 
weather's hampered what I've been able

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:08.939 
weather's hampered what I've been able
to<00:04:05.739> do<00:04:05.979> outside<00:04:06.510> but<00:04:07.510> it<00:04:07.930> hasn't<00:04:08.199> affected<00:04:08.470> at

00:04:08.939 --> 00:04:08.949 
to do outside but it hasn't affected at

00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:10.050 
to do outside but it hasn't affected at
all<00:04:09.129> what<00:04:09.340> I've<00:04:09.489> been<00:04:09.639> doing<00:04:09.909> in<00:04:10.030> the

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:10.060 
all what I've been doing in the

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:13.020 
all what I've been doing in the
greenhouse<00:04:10.709> I've<00:04:11.709> got<00:04:11.979> three<00:04:12.340> of<00:04:12.459> my<00:04:12.609> tomato

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:15.010 
plants into a grow back

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:17.460 
plants into a grow back
you<00:04:15.579> think<00:04:15.790> these<00:04:15.909> rather<00:04:16.180> spiffy<00:04:16.780> grow<00:04:17.169> rings

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:17.470 
you think these rather spiffy grow rings

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:19.289 
you think these rather spiffy grow rings
regular<00:04:18.099> viewers<00:04:18.340> will<00:04:18.549> know<00:04:18.760> what<00:04:19.060> these<00:04:19.239> are

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:19.299 
regular viewers will know what these are

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:22.350 
regular viewers will know what these are
on<00:04:19.810> how<00:04:19.959> they<00:04:20.139> work<00:04:20.409> if<00:04:20.829> you're<00:04:21.669> not<00:04:21.849> a<00:04:21.880> regular

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:22.360 
on how they work if you're not a regular

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:25.080 
on how they work if you're not a regular
viewer<00:04:22.539> why<00:04:23.199> not<00:04:23.530> where<00:04:24.130> you<00:04:24.250> been<00:04:24.610> all<00:04:24.880> this

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:25.090 
viewer why not where you been all this

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:28.050 
viewer why not where you been all this
time<00:04:25.830> basically<00:04:26.830> they<00:04:27.039> work<00:04:27.280> by<00:04:27.550> putting<00:04:27.820> the

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:28.060 
time basically they work by putting the

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:29.580 
time basically they work by putting the
water<00:04:28.300> into<00:04:28.630> the<00:04:28.659> outer<00:04:28.870> ring<00:04:29.229> which<00:04:29.380> then

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:29.590 
water into the outer ring which then

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:32.040 
water into the outer ring which then
triples<00:04:29.949> in<00:04:30.039> the<00:04:30.190> grow<00:04:30.340> back<00:04:30.610> much<00:04:31.389> easier<00:04:31.900> to

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:32.050 
triples in the grow back much easier to

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:34.980 
triples in the grow back much easier to
keep<00:04:32.229> things<00:04:32.530> watered<00:04:33.039> and<00:04:33.849> this<00:04:34.360> year<00:04:34.719> I've

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:34.990 
keep things watered and this year I've

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:38.120 
keep things watered and this year I've
decided<00:04:35.529> to<00:04:35.800> try<00:04:36.279> growing<00:04:36.639> chili<00:04:37.180> plants

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:38.130 
decided to try growing chili plants

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:41.300 
decided to try growing chili plants
grow<00:04:38.550> back<00:04:38.850> I've<00:04:39.840> put<00:04:40.170> three<00:04:40.470> in<00:04:40.590> one<00:04:40.980> grow

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:41.310

grow back I've put three in one grow
back<00:04:41.610> I'm<00:04:42.570> really<00:04:43.020> interested<00:04:43.320> to<00:04:43.620> see

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:43.740 
back I'm really interested to see

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:45.770 
back I'm really interested to see
whether<00:04:44.310> with<00:04:44.670> all<00:04:44.820> that<00:04:44.970> extra<00:04:45.150> space<00:04:45.720> for

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:45.780 
whether with all that extra space for

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:48.110 
whether with all that extra space for
their<00:04:46.110> roots<00:04:46.350> to<00:04:46.500> grow<00:04:46.740> whether<00:04:47.670> they<00:04:47.880> grow

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:48.120 
their roots to grow whether they grow

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:51.170 
their roots to grow whether they grow

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:02.120 
other things for comparison I'm going to
grow<00:05:00.330> three<00:05:00.660> chili<00:05:01.020> plants<00:05:01.350> in<00:05:01.500> pots<00:05:01.800> as

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:02.130 
grow three chili plants in pots as

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:04.280 
grow three chili plants in pots as
normal<00:05:02.580> and<00:05:03.270> then<00:05:03.480> I'll<00:05:03.600> be<00:05:03.720> able<00:05:03.900> to<00:05:03.990> do<00:05:04.110> all

sort of nerdy things like calculate the

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:10.490 
sort of nerdy things like calculate the
yield<00:05:07.740> per<00:05:08.220> bush<00:05:08.520> the<00:05:09.360> overall<00:05:09.810> percentage

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:10.500 
yield per bush the overall percentage

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:13.160 
yield per bush the overall percentage
increase<00:05:11.010> in<00:05:11.040> yield<00:05:11.580> of<00:05:11.790> cheese<00:05:12.120> if<00:05:12.480> there<00:05:13.050> is

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:13.170 
increase in yield of cheese if there is

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:16.460 
increase in yield of cheese if there is
any<00:05:13.410> comparing<00:05:14.100> the<00:05:14.220> two<00:05:14.400> methods<00:05:14.850> oh<00:05:15.060> I<00:05:16.020> love
