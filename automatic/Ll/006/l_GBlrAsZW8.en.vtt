on<00:04:23.720> this<00:04:23.930> one<00:04:24.200> um<00:04:25.190> this<00:04:25.430> is<00:04:25.550> a<00:04:25.580> very<00:04:25.910> particular

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:26.450 
on this one um this is a very particular

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:29.800 
on this one um this is a very particular
one<00:04:26.870> but<00:04:27.200> I<00:04:27.470> think<00:04:27.950> I'm<00:04:28.070> going<00:04:28.220> to<00:04:28.250> use<00:04:28.810> the

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:29.810 
one but I think I'm going to use the

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:30.910 
one but I think I'm going to use the
skin<00:04:30.020> color<00:04:30.230> because<00:04:30.440> I<00:04:30.500> think<00:04:30.560> the<00:04:30.710> knees<00:04:30.830> are

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:30.920 
skin color because I think the knees are

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:31.990 
skin color because I think the knees are
going<00:04:31.010> to<00:04:31.100> bend<00:04:31.250> about<00:04:31.430> right<00:04:31.580> here

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:32.000 
going to bend about right here

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.810 
going to bend about right here
so<00:04:32.660> right<00:04:33.320> here<00:04:33.530> we<00:04:33.710> just<00:04:33.770> color<00:04:34.310> in<00:04:34.490> the<00:04:34.610> top

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:34.820
