 Oh, how are you guys welcome? 

00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:07.609
 although it would be a video and if we are in my 

00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:10.550
 car pocket edition and we are in the 

00:00:07.609 --> 00:00:12.440
 version 0 point 12.1 alpha wheel 11 in 

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:14.060

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:15.500
 great texture I do not remember his 

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:17.689

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:21.890
 Well, here it is, there must be some 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:23.419

 I can wrongfully excuse me for doing what 

00:00:25.339 --> 00:00:29.150
 which would then be the title of this that the 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:31.699
 it's really super cool and then you 're 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:33.530

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:36.020
 the sexual ones that go cutting then and 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:37.310
 well it could also be ok 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:38.900
 guys since I would have made me what 

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:41.270
 it would be the banner that I have on the cover 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:42.830

 obviously start with the review of 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:51.080
 this great texture as we see then 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:53.360
 the wallpaper and the title change 

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:55.220
 the buttons do not change at all and 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:57.050

 commenting something may in your 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.740
 devices almost since this texture is 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.620
 a very good resolution and may 

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:09.230
 they are mobile 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:11.300
 I did not share billy, it's something like that and 

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:14.180

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:18.530
 2.3 forwards so then 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:20.270
 let's start with this review since this 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:22.760
 texture is one of the chronicles since 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:24.380
 they combine several many things so 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.360
 I thank the person who told me about 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.460

 I will be portering today at night so 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.600
 well we see here the torches the 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:37.190
 different types of slabs and all that for 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.380
 here we have what follows the route block 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:40.940
 what way would take cats 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:43.550
 the poster that the truth looks super mega 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:45.920
 Here we find this 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:47.450
 the truth looks super cool and good 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.190
 guys over here we're not going to 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.320
 find more things like we can be 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:53.360
 observing the stonemason who follow the 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:56.000
 trunks on the rails the rails look 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.770
 super cool the mine car the water 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.330

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:01.430
 here we have the iron fences 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:03.080
 they see super cool the lava fire 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:04.820
 they do not change the different types of 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.990
 flowers as well as the different types 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:08.119
 of stairs 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:10.220
 with this we find ourselves at the door is 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:12.560
 one of the ones that over this texture 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:13.940
 sorry as we see because here we have the 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.160
 blocks the blocks look super 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:18.650
 great is supposed to resolution 128 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:21.080

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.920
 this person ends it more or less 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.500
 about three thirty in the morning 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:32.060
 the early morning and because you took 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:33.980
 so much in doing the review so very 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.500
 simple because the truth was very 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:38.510
 early and well the truth is not me 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.069
 I woke up I fell asleep I woke up 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:42.170
 until the one more or less and 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:44.060
 I was watching there things movies all 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:46.100

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:56.120
 that they want to make vision only 

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:57.739
 I ask for some things the first one is if it is in 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.780
 the vision of assembling credits how to do 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:01.430
 that we can simple not leaving the links 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:02.780
 Direct simply send what 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:04.910
 it would be the video for them to 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:07.400

 the texture is super cool how 

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:14.430
 we can be observing is one of the 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:18.450
 textures that I loved the most since it joins 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:20.790
 several textures like what would be the r3 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:22.829
 of craft something like that was called spaces 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:24.480
 as we see in the cake among others 

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:26.250
 textures as we can be observing 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:27.930
 the truth looks super cool specific 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:30.030
 of this texture and I invite you to 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:32.040

 what would be the publication of this 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:37.319
 texture for you to load will come 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:39.390
 what would be the zip point and the point of 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:43.409
 apply the point that here is supposed to 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:44.970
 is for version 2.3 onwards and what 

00:03:43.409 --> 00:03:46.950

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:48.959
 launcher guys and I good if you guys 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:50.459
 they want to install manually if not 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:51.870
 It serves them, it applies to me, I invite you to 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:53.819
 they do it ends by description them 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:55.500
 I will leave a small tutorial where 

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:58.049
 can put textures to their teacher poque 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:59.639
 of editing and good on this occasion 

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:01.379
 I left what would be online half family 

00:03:59.639 --> 00:04:03.659
 that much they like more that so that there 

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:05.549
 I left them and good as we see some 

00:04:03.659 --> 00:04:07.409
 they change us and some do not go almost 

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:08.819
 It changes just like the pig of the pig if 

00:04:07.409 --> 00:04:10.920
 I'm not mistaken is the download to 

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:12.900
 Like what would be the glutton this 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:14.280
 texture is super pretty cool the 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:16.560
 true guys 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:18.000
 the domesticated dog does not change but the 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:19.769
 dog not domesticated and here the 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.320
 champions also that looks super cool 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:23.970
 lupis more here we find the 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:26.910
 skeleton and look what I did not like is 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:28.860
 this the particles and the particles or 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:30.000
 well they change you in everything and good to me what 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:31.139
 What I liked most is that at the moment 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.750
 attack a mod 

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:36.090
 that is, when attacking it simply 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:37.800
 they come out to you like little stars and it's 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:39.960
 one of the things that I loved about 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:41.910
 this texture and well I do not know about you but 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:44.460
