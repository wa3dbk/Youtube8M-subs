all right all right Dave kala here and
let's<00:00:04.620> do<00:00:04.799> some<00:00:05.069> box<00:00:05.400> modeling<00:00:06.170> first<00:00:07.170> we<00:00:07.410> will

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560 
let's do some box modeling first we will

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.400 
let's do some box modeling first we will
throw<00:00:07.890> down<00:00:08.099> a<00:00:08.429> box<00:00:08.880> hit<00:00:09.300> the<00:00:09.330> tab<00:00:09.660> key<00:00:09.690> go<00:00:10.349> to

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
throw down a box hit the tab key go to

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.089 
throw down a box hit the tab key go to
box<00:00:10.910> hit<00:00:11.910> enter

box hit enter

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:15.829 
box hit enter
zoom<00:00:14.099> in<00:00:14.370> here<00:00:14.700> we're<00:00:15.000> at<00:00:15.089> the<00:00:15.240> scene<00:00:15.450> level

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
zoom in here we're at the scene level

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.519 
zoom in here we're at the scene level
dive<00:00:16.560> down<00:00:16.949> into<00:00:17.010> the<00:00:17.490> geometry<00:00:18.180> level<00:00:18.500> now<00:00:19.500> I

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
dive down into the geometry level now I

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.220 
dive down into the geometry level now I
like<00:00:19.980> pressing<00:00:20.640> this<00:00:21.029> button<00:00:21.090> we<00:00:21.630> go<00:00:21.810> to<00:00:21.869> flat

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
like pressing this button we go to flat

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.509 
like pressing this button we go to flat
why<00:00:22.470> are<00:00:22.619> shaded<00:00:23.010> and<00:00:23.269> then<00:00:24.269> I<00:00:24.630> will<00:00:24.810> hit<00:00:24.930> for

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:25.519 
why are shaded and then I will hit for

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:28.179 
why are shaded and then I will hit for
hitting<00:00:26.519> the<00:00:26.640> four<00:00:26.939> key<00:00:27.150> allows<00:00:27.390> you<00:00:27.570> to<00:00:27.660> pick

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:28.189 
hitting the four key allows you to pick

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:30.939 
hitting the four key allows you to pick
primitives<00:00:29.189> which<00:00:29.490> in<00:00:29.640> this<00:00:29.760> case<00:00:29.939> is<00:00:30.179> facets

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:30.949 
primitives which in this case is facets

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:36.770 
primitives which in this case is facets
so<00:00:31.949> let<00:00:32.700> me<00:00:32.820> do<00:00:33.170> poly<00:00:34.579> extrude<00:00:35.579> and<00:00:36.030> so<00:00:36.660> we

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
so let me do poly extrude and so we

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.049 
so let me do poly extrude and so we
could<00:00:36.930> pull<00:00:37.110> this<00:00:37.260> out<00:00:37.469> here<00:00:37.879> here's<00:00:38.879> how<00:00:39.000> you

could pull this out here here's how you

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.630 
could pull this out here here's how you
can<00:00:39.210> get<00:00:39.450> non-proportional<00:00:40.260> scale<00:00:40.950> if<00:00:41.579> you

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
can get non-proportional scale if you

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.990 
can get non-proportional scale if you

pull this out Q one more time so now we

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.929 
pull this out Q one more time so now we
have<00:02:00.509> a<00:02:00.570> basic<00:02:01.020> shape<00:02:01.049> and<00:02:01.680> now<00:02:02.219> we<00:02:02.280> can

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
have a basic shape and now we can

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:07.490 
have a basic shape and now we can
subdivide<00:02:03.360> it<00:02:04.310> type<00:02:05.310> in<00:02:05.549> subdivide<00:02:06.500> connect

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
subdivide it type in subdivide connect

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.639 
subdivide it type in subdivide connect
it<00:02:07.649> over<00:02:07.890> into<00:02:08.009> there<00:02:08.310> and<00:02:09.179> now<00:02:10.080> we<00:02:10.140> can

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
it over into there and now we can

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.770 
it over into there and now we can
increase<00:02:10.979> or<00:02:11.430> decrease<00:02:11.610> the<00:02:11.910> depth

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
increase or decrease the depth

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.380 
increase or decrease the depth
so<00:02:13.410> that's<00:02:13.830> some<00:02:14.040> simple<00:02:14.430> box<00:02:14.670> modeling<00:02:15.210> for

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
so that's some simple box modeling for

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.770 
so that's some simple box modeling for
you

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
you

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.860
