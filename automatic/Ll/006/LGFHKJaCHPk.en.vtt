00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.270
 hi techno fans how are they are 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:04.799
 jose techno fanatic counted on me and 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.210
 I have the unpacked and the 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:07.560
 installation of a case very 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.559
 interesting that it is in the back 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.450
 carbon fiber for iphone 55 s 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:16.250
 of the company is lic 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.250
 dotcom raps we go the video 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.560
 in this opportunity the company is 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:31.230
 live.com sent us this box 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:34.199
 for the iphone 55 that is very interesting 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.629
 because the back is made of fiber 

00:00:34.199 --> 00:00:40.170
 real carbon let's see what else we 

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:42.449
 includes inside the box that we have 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.179
 some additional things like 

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:47.519
 example also this fiber study of 

00:00:45.179 --> 00:00:49.469
 carbon to place it in the part 

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:51.149
 front as on the sides and here 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.460
 you can see what they are going to have 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.559
 this option for what is the iphone5 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.360
 efe and here the part of the camera for the 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.899
 iphone 5 then what are we going to do 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.039
 is to install it on our device and 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.799
 see how it looks and give to you 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.540
 some some data and specifications 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.120
 of the product 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.480
 something very interesting is that the company 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:14.100
 a screen saver is not included 

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:16.380
 but that is simply to cover the 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.020
 screen thanks to which you are going to 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.940
 have this protector that will cover 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:24.150
 all sides then what are we going 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:27.750
 to do us now is to install this 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:30.410
 protector to our iphone if we go 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:33.300
 piano piano by parts we go first 

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:38.550
 we also go first to clean the 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:43.310
 screen and we're going to place 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:43.310
 our protector this one 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:49.150
 and this we are going to place it I do not know if 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.920
 you are seeing well yes 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:53.460
 then this would simply be 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.460
 for the 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:04.090
 and you can see that it has adhered 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:07.350
 how to be and here we have found 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:09.209
 with a little niggle 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:12.020
 and let's see if we can remove this 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:12.020
 m a little kid 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:17.590
 ok as you could see I'm not a 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:21.170
 expert leaving these plates 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:24.520
 unfortunately and what to do now is 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.520
 place and is here 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:34.489
 is 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:36.430
 and ready then now what are we going to 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:39.260
 do us and you can see 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:41.599
 understood there is not a problem and 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.580
 would be with the fiber part of 

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:46.760
 carbon and we will also have the 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:48.590
 sides and in case of placing it 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:51.380
 they will be able to do because here we are going 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:53.599
 to find strategies areas 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:54.830
 then what we are going to do is create 

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:56.560
 this that has a minute because no 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:59.830
 I want to do it is to waste time 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:01.239
 we just installed the vinyl in the 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:02.770
 sides and you can see if from 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:04.240
 carbon 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:05.750
 in the part of the camera in the part 

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:08.780
 higher 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:11.690
 as also in the bottom as 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:13.640
 you can see it is ready to 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:16.280
 can install it in the case that 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:18.800
 just under pressure like you 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:20.750
 can see the company ensures that it has 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:22.850
 one millimeter of protection in the part 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:24.290
 frontal although I think it's a bit 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:26.750
 less but this way you keep 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:28.130
 a small a small relief so that 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:29.840
 the mind that places in third place is 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:32.360
 flat surfaces because it protects it 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:35.090
 be the screen the first thing I know what 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:37.610
 touch on the flat surface you 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:41.180
 you can see what's in there well stuck 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:43.100
 as well as in the back and the 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:45.770
 side you can see the vinyl of 

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:47.690
 carbon fiber the back of the 

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:49.370
 case is real carbon fiber 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:50.930
 you can feel the difference to 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:53.690
 moment they touch it, if it is not like 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:55.850
 which we have here in front in 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:58.520
 the part of the sides is 

00:03:55.850 --> 00:04:00.590
 this hard plastic but it's like 

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:02.450
 prosecuted because you have 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:04.550
 much more grip at the moment you do not 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:08.510
 they have the hand now what is the price 

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:09.950
 of this case is 34 dollars with 95 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:12.260
 and in case you are already interested
