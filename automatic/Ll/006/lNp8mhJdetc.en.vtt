00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:09.560
 hello very good everyone I'm going to premiere 

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:14.410
 my channel with this video 

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:17.720
 of tips and tricks that 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:20.580
 what do I have to get money 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:25.290
 pretty fast 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:28.410
 and how to save and let's see the 

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:32.820
 first thing we have to do is put together 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:37.559
 to the players that we have on average 75 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:42.290
 77 players that place us or not 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.290
 they get me bent when I re see you 

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:48.910
 so what we are going to do is play 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:48.910
 some leagues 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:56.090
 example today is the league bbva today is 

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:58.270
 the English league are four games that 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:58.270
 are 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:03.550
 2000 per game won 2000 2000 and little 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:09.700
 and by playing all four games 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.700
 are 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:13.109
 over 8000 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.710
 more after the representative they give you 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.370
 of the English league 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:25.180
 good 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:30.390
 and the one that I play a lot is also this 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:30.390
 the master that you get 7500 for winning it 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:36.890
 and this is pretty good the only thing 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:41.940
 you have to 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:44.570
 you'll get an average of 1450 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:44.570
 what's that 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:50.090
 you do it by getting normal players from 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:53.899
 media 80 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:56.240
 and of substitutes you put to the cracks that 

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:58.270
 you have on your computer so you can upload 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:01.270
 valuation after you will not use them 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:01.270
 but 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:07.750
 you have them there for you to climb 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:09.560
 I for example have it and I have this 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:11.450
 team 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.400
 well there are some internal bars and some 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:18.520
 player that I lack there but with beige 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:21.520
 with average players 79 78 80 you can 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:25.340
 do grandchildren after the cracks 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:28.010
 Christian I water it in thiago so that 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:30.739
 I'll upload the media myself right now here 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:35.290
 I have 1,450 because I have three more 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:35.290
 players but you get easy 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:42.930
 after 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:46.079
 what I advise also spend 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:49.709
 the representatives these I have 64 

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:52.109
 right now spend those 11 because as 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:53.609
 you know now the trick of getting 

00:02:52.109 --> 00:02:56.099
 the hundred percent players no longer 

00:02:53.609 --> 00:02:58.640
 exists and I do not think they put it back 

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:58.640
 so 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:03.079
 spend them one by one and according to the player 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.940
 which is for example the power of 

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:07.280
 shot goes 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:09.980
 this with a player is going to touch me 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:12.800
 bronze shit 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:15.950
 now there is no light of the five of the 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:19.760
 six balls of white sixth with 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:22.629
 white and of touch a white one because they are 250 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.629
 and what do you get? 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:33.670
 now going to sell century are 250 gps that 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:33.670
 opens 10 or 20 is already some money 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:37.980
 let's sell it 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:43.540
 I have several bad ones of these to sell 

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:52.160
 the 250 bosses and little by little you get together 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:52.160
 more the more such tournaments 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:59.470
 then there is also I do not know if you know 

00:03:56.629 --> 00:03:59.470
 but 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:05.180
 contracts go by minutes do not go by 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:08.180
 matches that I want to say with this that 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:11.810
 for example you play a game with 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:14.990
 Christian and at 30 minutes you're winning 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:16.600
 40 but you can change it for another 

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:20.640
 player 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:23.650
 and you only accumulate those 30 minutes not 

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:25.270
 will be only 30 minutes, so it's not 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:27.040
 a match is spent only up to 30 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:29.440
 minutes 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:30.820
 and this is good because you can win 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:32.410
 some game left over in the first 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:35.410
 part you can change make three changes 

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:38.710
 and you change the three best ones that more 

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:42.540
 contracts you spend and makes a way to 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:42.540
 save simple too 

00:04:43.569 --> 00:04:50.039
 and well and I do not know what little bit more I have 

00:04:47.559 --> 00:04:50.039
 what to say 

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:56.540
 you know where the cup masters 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:05.300
 is the best cup to save I think 

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:05.300
 because you are taking a 

00:05:05.569 --> 00:05:10.900
 15,000 or so I'm coming out taking more 

00:05:08.659 --> 00:05:15.950
 or less every time the game 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:18.230
 because between that you win and you get 7500 

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:20.600
 more after some player of these that 

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:24.760
 you do not like it and you can sell it already 

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:24.760
 are 500 600 depends on the player 

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:29.980
 taking out some peels 

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:38.950
 and good and nothing more, thank you very much for 

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:38.950
 watch the video 

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:44.850
 and that a greeting to all
