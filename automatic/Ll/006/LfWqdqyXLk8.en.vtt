00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:09.719
 hello I am albeit known as 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.580
 the guy in my office in question 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.549
 Do you already have a company network 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.109
 seen that anything but ideal 

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:18.720
 every new problem is a completely new solution 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.770
 until everything is completely confusing me 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.360
 encountered something like that last 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.920
 I have just received a new order from 

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:25.050
 boss will get me his new one right away 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.640
 problem description will look at this 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.920
 I'll show you something here 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.440
 where do I just start to see 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.059
 So the hard-working guys would have 

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:34.739
 all this stuff here are the servers 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.629
 are a bit dusty yes the 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.829
 We have been using software since 2003 

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:39.690
 for all important business applications 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.219
 since then many things have changed 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.989
 for years they have done and 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:48.960
 strive and get slower and slower 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:50.909
 and unpredictable the other man would have 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.620
 almost abandoned as our most important 

00:00:50.909 --> 00:00:54.539
 application crashed is what us one 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.370
 amount of sales and all are 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.139
 already completely finished because you with bio the 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.549
 have to keep up while I'm there 

00:00:58.139 --> 00:01:02.370

00:00:59.549 --> 00:01:07.920

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.969

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.829

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:37.549
 risk diminishes ours 

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:37.549
