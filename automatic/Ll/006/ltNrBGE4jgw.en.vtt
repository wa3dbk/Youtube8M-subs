00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:19.820
 I dont know 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:22.730
 we are recontra happy because because 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:26.060
 we have come from this wonderful town 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:29.990
 what is it that we have been with these 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:31.340
 cows grazing on these green hills the 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:34.640
 true that for me it has been a 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:36.830
 discovery cows happy and good we 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.660
 we have brought a bit of that milk that 

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:40.640
 they came in those bars and it's a milk 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:43.250
 spectacular fatty and is full of 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.780
 taste and let's make yogurt from home 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:47.420
 that sometimes we think a lot how hard 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:49.729
 It will make yogurt is not difficult it 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:51.720
 The only thing you need is a rennet to 

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:55.860
 yoghurt or 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:57.270
 then we have the water here we are going to 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.280
 to learn 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:02.400
 but strong that the water starts to boil 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.500
 below and what we want is to reach 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:06.810
 that the milk has a temperature of 85 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.570
 degrees you will feel without more or less is 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.710
 when he breaks the boil or before 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:15.280
 start to break the boil 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:17.020
 let's go moving to ensure 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:20.280
 that the temperature 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.280
 that is distributing to milk 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:32.310
 ok then 85 degrees and here we have a 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:37.200
 bowl with ice water so that for 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:40.950
 cool the milk and bring it to 43 degrees 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:43.439
 let's move to cool faster and 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:47.630
 also to prevent it from forming 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:47.630
 cream we do not want cream to be 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:55.380
 let's place our rennet our 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.630
 bacteria to make yogurt is a 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:01.230
 thermophilic bacteria that means that 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:03.780
 acts revives when it is at a 

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:08.130
 hot temperature we have 2 liters of 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:13.280
 milk go 10 grams we move 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:13.280
 so that it dissolves well and then 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:19.780
 we have a few already sterilized in 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:23.280
 this is going to let the milk set 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.280
 and become yogurt 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:29.079
 we close 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:32.980
 Remember that everything is clean 

00:02:29.079 --> 00:02:37.239
 and sterilized immediately we're going to 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:43.130
 cover a bit of newspaper and we're going to 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:45.370
 clothe them we need that milk 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:49.220
 keep at 38 degrees centigrade 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:52.670
 for 7 hours we are going to put you 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:56.720
 quality period what is important is that 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:58.140
 keep them at 38 degrees hot I 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.850
 I have here 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:02.900
 one of these things that keep the 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:02.900
 temperature is cold or hot 

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:07.950
 of that 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:09.670
 you do not have to move it much gay and we're going to 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:12.280
 leave them here 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:16.959
 between 7 and 10 hours the longer 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:19.750
 have that temperature at 38 degrees more 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:20.910
 dense is going to be the most flavor yogurt goes to 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:23.770
 develop ok 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:25.300
 Look at this, it looks a little cut, it's 

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:28.209
 normal that looks cut now what 

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:30.790
 we have to do is put it in a 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:33.910
 sieve we will strain it through a sieve 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:35.739
 fine and let's let it drain everything 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:38.260
 that serum that is here and in that way 

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:39.550
 let's thicken more the yogurt not that I'm going 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:44.200
 to do myself first plus prepare my 

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:47.900
 breakfast with a rich fruit is not a 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:52.300

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:55.560

 and here the super honey of our environment 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:07.900
 overturn 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:09.700
 moment 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:13.930
 and therefore 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:16.800
 we mix and now the second part of me 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:16.800
