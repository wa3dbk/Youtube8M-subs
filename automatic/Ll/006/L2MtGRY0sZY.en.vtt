hello<00:00:01.709> and<00:00:01.740> welcome<00:00:01.979> to<00:00:02.190> this<00:00:02.370> blender<00:00:02.790> topic

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:03.210 
hello and welcome to this blender topic

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.980 
hello and welcome to this blender topic
on<00:00:03.389> animating<00:00:04.200> a<00:00:04.549> mesh<00:00:05.549> object<00:00:06.029> through<00:00:06.270> a<00:00:06.330> an

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
on animating a mesh object through a an

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:08.960 
on animating a mesh object through a an
armature<00:00:07.379> and<00:00:07.529> this<00:00:07.830> is<00:00:07.980> a<00:00:08.010> continuation<00:00:08.370> from

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
armature and this is a continuation from

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.749 
armature and this is a continuation from
the<00:00:09.240> very<00:00:09.420> first<00:00:09.889> installment<00:00:10.889> in<00:00:11.190> this<00:00:11.340> topic

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
the very first installment in this topic

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:17.000 
the very first installment in this topic
and<00:00:12.019> then<00:00:13.019> we<00:00:13.290> skinned<00:00:14.719> these<00:00:15.719> two<00:00:15.990> objects<00:00:16.529> to

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
and then we skinned these two objects to

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.420 
and then we skinned these two objects to
this<00:00:17.580> armature<00:00:18.210> and<00:00:18.590> I<00:00:19.590> talked<00:00:19.859> about<00:00:19.980> wanting

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
this armature and I talked about wanting

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.269 
this armature and I talked about wanting
to<00:00:20.609> look<00:00:20.910> at<00:00:21.150> what<00:00:21.330> happens<00:00:21.779> when<00:00:22.619> your<00:00:22.769> skin

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
to look at what happens when your skin

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.929 
to look at what happens when your skin
than<00:00:23.490> a<00:00:23.689> mesh<00:00:24.689> object<00:00:25.289> to<00:00:25.500> an<00:00:25.740> armature<00:00:26.070> so

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
than a mesh object to an armature so

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:32.870 
than a mesh object to an armature so
let's<00:00:27.330> look<00:00:27.570> at<00:00:27.930> this<00:00:28.109> object<00:00:28.619> first<00:00:31.880> under

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
let's look at this object first under

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.500 
let's look at this object first under
the<00:00:34.100> vertex<00:00:35.100> group<00:00:35.309> tab<00:00:35.610> you<00:00:35.969> find<00:00:36.270> that

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
the vertex group tab you find that

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.380 
the vertex group tab you find that
there's<00:00:36.780> a<00:00:37.079> first<00:00:37.860> and<00:00:38.160> second<00:00:38.670> vertex<00:00:39.059> groups

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
there's a first and second vertex groups

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.930 
there's a first and second vertex groups
these<00:00:39.629> are<00:00:39.870> automatically<00:00:40.500> created<00:00:40.910> when<00:00:41.910> you

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
these are automatically created when you

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.740 
these are automatically created when you
do<00:00:42.360> the<00:00:42.510> skinning<00:00:42.930> that<00:00:43.170> you'll<00:00:43.500> get<00:00:43.770> a<00:00:44.750> every

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
do the skinning that you'll get a every

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.529 
do the skinning that you'll get a every
bone<00:00:45.960> that<00:00:46.320> is<00:00:46.500> relevant<00:00:47.010> to<00:00:47.430> the<00:00:48.030> armature

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
bone that is relevant to the armature

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:53.090 
bone that is relevant to the armature
and<00:00:48.780> that<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:49.530> object<00:00:50.039> is<00:00:50.579> skin<00:00:51.360> to<00:00:51.770> will<00:00:52.770> have

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
and that the object is skin to will have

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.819 
and that the object is skin to will have
its<00:00:53.430> corresponding<00:00:54.079> vertex<00:00:55.079> group<00:00:55.440> so<00:00:55.710> if

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
its corresponding vertex group so if

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.529 
its corresponding vertex group so if
there<00:00:56.039> is<00:00:56.129> a<00:00:56.160> bone<00:00:56.670> that's<00:00:56.940> called<00:00:57.210> first

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
there is a bone that's called first

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.319 
there is a bone that's called first
you'll<00:00:57.989> have<00:00:58.109> a<00:00:58.170> first<00:00:58.559> a<00:00:59.000> vertex<00:01:00.000> group

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
you'll have a first a vertex group

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.500 
you'll have a first a vertex group
called<00:01:00.660> first<00:01:00.930> and<00:01:01.520> so<00:01:02.520> forth<00:01:02.820> and<00:01:02.910> so<00:01:03.090> on<00:01:03.149> and

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
called first and so forth and so on and

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.450 
called first and so forth and so on and
then<00:01:05.090> if<00:01:06.090> we<00:01:06.390> look<00:01:06.600> at<00:01:06.750> this<00:01:06.990> in<00:01:07.430> edit<00:01:08.430> mode

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
then if we look at this in edit mode

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.870 
then if we look at this in edit mode
press<00:01:09.420> tab<00:01:09.689> to<00:01:09.720> go<00:01:09.960> to<00:01:10.020> edit<00:01:10.290> mode<00:01:10.439> and<00:01:11.070> this

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
press tab to go to edit mode and this

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.510 
press tab to go to edit mode and this
select<00:01:12.840> first<00:01:13.229> we<00:01:13.500> can<00:01:13.650> see<00:01:13.799> that<00:01:13.950> yes<00:01:14.280> there

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
select first we can see that yes there

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.090 
select first we can see that yes there
is<00:01:14.640> something<00:01:15.030> selected<00:01:15.299> there<00:01:15.689> and<00:01:16.070> if<00:01:17.070> we

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
is something selected there and if we

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.999 
is something selected there and if we
choose<00:01:17.460> second<00:01:18.119> I<00:01:18.330> have<00:01:18.750> to<00:01:18.930> wait<00:01:19.590> a<00:01:19.650> minute<00:01:19.890> I

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
choose second I have to wait a minute I

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.910 
choose second I have to wait a minute I
have<00:01:20.130> to<00:01:20.369> deselect<00:01:20.820> at<00:01:21.060> first<00:01:21.299> and<00:01:21.630> then

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:21.920 
have to deselect at first and then

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.679 
have to deselect at first and then
choose<00:01:22.920> second<00:01:23.460> and<00:01:23.700> I<00:01:23.939> select<00:01:24.270> it<00:01:24.450> and<00:01:24.600> then

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
choose second and I select it and then

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.530 
choose second and I select it and then
there's<00:01:25.049> there's<00:01:25.439> nothing<00:01:25.979> in<00:01:26.189> this<00:01:27.150> mash

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
there's there's nothing in this mash

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.530 
there's there's nothing in this mash
that<00:01:27.780> is<00:01:27.960> so<00:01:28.229> that<00:01:28.650> is<00:01:28.799> part<00:01:29.280> of<00:01:29.430> that<00:01:29.670> vertex

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
that is so that is part of that vertex

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.310 
that is so that is part of that vertex
group<00:01:31.610> and<00:01:32.610> that's<00:01:32.939> because<00:01:33.299> there's<00:01:34.229> no

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
group and that's because there's no

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.120 
group and that's because there's no
proximity<00:01:35.189> between<00:01:35.369> this<00:01:36.360> mesh<00:01:36.990> and<00:01:37.409> the

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
proximity between this mesh and the

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.249 
proximity between this mesh and the
second<00:01:38.579> bone<00:01:38.790> so<00:01:39.329> it's<00:01:39.479> only<00:01:39.600> the<00:01:39.840> first<00:01:39.990> bone

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
second bone so it's only the first bone

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.639 
second bone so it's only the first bone
that<00:01:40.500> becomes<00:01:41.540> meaningful<00:01:42.540> to<00:01:42.960> actually<00:01:43.439> have

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
that becomes meaningful to actually have

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:48.889 
that becomes meaningful to actually have
any<00:01:43.860> vertexes<00:01:44.369> in<00:01:46.670> and<00:01:47.670> all<00:01:47.909> the<00:01:48.180> press<00:01:48.509> tab<00:01:48.780> we

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
any vertexes in and all the press tab we

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.569 
any vertexes in and all the press tab we
go<00:01:49.020> back<00:01:49.170> to<00:01:49.200> object<00:01:49.470> mode<00:01:49.770> and<00:01:50.159> then<00:01:50.280> we<00:01:50.399> can

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
go back to object mode and then we can

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:54.200 
go back to object mode and then we can
look<00:01:50.759> at<00:01:50.909> this<00:01:51.119> from<00:01:51.509> another<00:01:52.880> perspective<00:01:53.880> we

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
look at this from another perspective we

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.670 
look at this from another perspective we
can<00:01:54.360> look<00:01:54.479> at<00:01:54.600> it<00:01:54.659> from<00:01:54.780> the<00:01:55.079> weight<00:01:55.320> paint

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
can look at it from the weight paint

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.160 
can look at it from the weight paint
perspective<00:01:56.430> and<00:01:56.640> then<00:01:56.790> you<00:01:56.969> can<00:01:57.119> see<00:01:57.360> when<00:01:58.049> it

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
perspective and then you can see when it

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.530 
perspective and then you can see when it
comes<00:01:58.350> to<00:01:58.500> the<00:01:58.649> first<00:01:58.979> bone<00:01:59.310> it's<00:01:59.640> completely

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
comes to the first bone it's completely

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.020 
comes to the first bone it's completely
red<00:02:00.899> it's<00:02:01.200> painted<00:02:01.680> all<00:02:01.860> red<00:02:02.159> which<00:02:02.790> means

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
red it's painted all red which means

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.999 
red it's painted all red which means
that<00:02:03.119> one<00:02:03.360> hundred<00:02:03.540> percent<00:02:03.689> if<00:02:04.170> this<00:02:04.770> bone<00:02:04.979> is

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
that one hundred percent if this bone is

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:06.920 
that one hundred percent if this bone is
one<00:02:05.310> hundred<00:02:05.399> percent<00:02:05.579> effective<00:02:06.149> on<00:02:06.630> this

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
one hundred percent effective on this

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.919 
one hundred percent effective on this
mesh<00:02:07.829> and<00:02:08.160> if<00:02:08.700> you<00:02:08.789> click<00:02:09.000> on<00:02:09.149> the<00:02:09.300> second<00:02:09.780> this

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
mesh and if you click on the second this

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.350 
mesh and if you click on the second this
it's<00:02:10.140> completely<00:02:10.739> blue<00:02:11.039> which<00:02:12.000> means<00:02:12.239> it's

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
it's completely blue which means it's

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.600 
it's completely blue which means it's
utterly<00:02:13.570> cold<00:02:14.020> to<00:02:14.470> touch<00:02:14.500> from<00:02:15.010> this<00:02:15.190> bone<00:02:15.400> in

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
utterly cold to touch from this bone in

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:19.140 
utterly cold to touch from this bone in
other<00:02:15.760> words<00:02:15.940> there<00:02:16.120> will<00:02:16.210> be<00:02:16.900> no<00:02:17.730> the<00:02:18.730> second

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
other words there will be no the second

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.930 
other words there will be no the second
bone<00:02:19.330> will<00:02:19.540> have<00:02:19.720> no<00:02:19.870> effect<00:02:19.900> on<00:02:20.620> on<00:02:21.100> this<00:02:21.670> mesh

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
bone will have no effect on on this mesh

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:26.610 
bone will have no effect on on this mesh
and<00:02:23.250> that's<00:02:24.250> just<00:02:24.400> because<00:02:25.470> there's<00:02:26.470> no

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
and that's just because there's no

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.070 
and that's just because there's no
proximity<00:02:27.310> so<00:02:27.550> the<00:02:28.000> automatic<00:02:28.510> function<00:02:28.870> will

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
proximity so the automatic function will

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:33.360 
proximity so the automatic function will
make<00:02:29.560> those<00:02:29.770> assignments<00:02:30.900> now<00:02:32.070> we<00:02:33.070> could

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
make those assignments now we could

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.070 
make those assignments now we could
think<00:02:33.610> that<00:02:33.760> we<00:02:33.880> could<00:02:34.120> completely<00:02:34.810> just

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
think that we could completely just

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:40.620 
think that we could completely just
delete<00:02:35.590> this<00:02:38.700> vertex<00:02:39.700> group<00:02:40.000> which<00:02:40.270> is<00:02:40.420> true

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:40.630 
delete this vertex group which is true

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:42.810 
delete this vertex group which is true
if<00:02:40.840> you<00:02:41.140> if<00:02:41.470> you<00:02:41.740> don't<00:02:41.920> want<00:02:42.130> any<00:02:42.310> influence

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:42.820 
if you if you don't want any influence

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:45.840 
if you if you don't want any influence
then<00:02:43.030> you<00:02:43.630> could<00:02:43.810> do<00:02:43.959> that<00:02:44.190> but<00:02:45.190> let's<00:02:45.430> say<00:02:45.640> we

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:45.850 
then you could do that but let's say we

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:48.870 
then you could do that but let's say we
want<00:02:46.090> to<00:02:46.180> do<00:02:46.420> this<00:02:46.660> we<00:02:47.200> would<00:02:47.380> like<00:02:47.590> this<00:02:48.010> when

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:48.880 
want to do this we would like this when

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:52.380 
want to do this we would like this when
this<00:02:49.030> bending<00:02:49.630> take<00:02:49.959> place<00:02:50.290> that<00:02:51.280> the<00:02:52.090> top

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390 
this bending take place that the top

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:55.190 
this bending take place that the top
face<00:02:52.810> here<00:02:53.200> should<00:02:53.410> kind<00:02:53.709> of<00:02:53.800> follow<00:02:54.130> the<00:02:54.520> band

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
face here should kind of follow the band

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.380 
face here should kind of follow the band
just<00:02:56.200> you<00:02:56.739> know<00:02:56.890> for<00:02:57.340> whatever<00:02:57.520> reason<00:02:58.150> and

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390 
just you know for whatever reason and

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:00.930 
just you know for whatever reason and
this<00:02:58.630> is<00:02:58.870> just<00:02:59.110> a<00:02:59.200> demonstrate<00:02:59.800> well<00:03:00.430> we<00:03:00.760> can

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:00.940 
this is just a demonstrate well we can

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:05.310 
this is just a demonstrate well we can
make<00:03:01.150> happen<00:03:02.760> so<00:03:03.760> we'll<00:03:04.300> take<00:03:04.570> this<00:03:04.780> one<00:03:05.020> here

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:05.320 
make happen so we'll take this one here

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:10.650 
make happen so we'll take this one here
I<00:03:05.440> select<00:03:06.100> that<00:03:06.160> face<00:03:06.520> there<00:03:07.290> and<00:03:09.150> I'll<00:03:10.150> assign

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:10.660 
I select that face there and I'll assign

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:21.380 
I select that face there and I'll assign
that<00:03:10.930> to<00:03:10.989> second<00:03:13.260> okay<00:03:14.260> and<00:03:16.110> then<00:03:18.810> go<00:03:19.810> over<00:03:19.840> to

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390 
that to second okay and then go over to

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:24.240 
that to second okay and then go over to
white<00:03:22.390> paint<00:03:22.690> and<00:03:22.959> look<00:03:23.620> what<00:03:23.769> that<00:03:23.799> looks

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.250 
white paint and look what that looks

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:29.430 
white paint and look what that looks
like<00:03:27.299> and<00:03:28.299> then<00:03:28.690> you<00:03:28.810> can<00:03:28.989> see<00:03:29.230> that

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:29.440 
like and then you can see that

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.650 
like and then you can see that
automatically<00:03:30.040> now<00:03:30.670> there's<00:03:30.940> an<00:03:31.090> influence

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:31.660 
automatically now there's an influence

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:36.390 
automatically now there's an influence
here<00:03:32.160> from<00:03:33.160> that<00:03:33.190> second<00:03:33.880> bone<00:03:34.860> so<00:03:35.860> let's<00:03:36.070> try

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:36.400 
here from that second bone so let's try

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:41.180 
here from that second bone so let's try
this<00:03:36.810> go<00:03:37.810> to<00:03:38.820> first<00:03:39.820> object<00:03:40.299> mode<00:03:40.510> and<00:03:40.840> then

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
this go to first object mode and then

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:51.710 
this go to first object mode and then
select<00:03:42.190> this<00:03:44.250> and<00:03:45.250> we<00:03:45.400> can<00:03:45.640> then<00:03:48.450> just<00:03:49.450> rotate

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:54.900 

this<00:03:52.720> and<00:03:53.049> there's<00:03:53.200> of<00:03:53.410> course<00:03:53.470> no<00:03:53.910> this

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:54.910 
this and there's of course no this

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:57.930 
this and there's of course no this
doesn't<00:03:55.299> move<00:03:55.570> relative<00:03:56.140> but<00:03:56.860> if<00:03:56.980> we<00:03:57.130> turn<00:03:57.670> off

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:57.940 
doesn't move relative but if we turn off

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:03.000 
doesn't move relative but if we turn off
let's<00:03:58.450> say<00:03:58.600> we<00:03:58.750> turn<00:03:58.930> off<00:04:01.380> inherit<00:04:02.380> rotation

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:03.010 
let's say we turn off inherit rotation

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:10.200 
let's say we turn off inherit rotation
there<00:04:03.390> then<00:04:04.390> if<00:04:04.750> we<00:04:04.959> select<00:04:05.170> this<00:04:05.440> bone

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:10.210 

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:15.180 

and<00:04:11.110> we<00:04:11.620> can<00:04:11.770> change<00:04:12.010> the<00:04:12.430> display<00:04:12.940> type<00:04:14.190> on

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:15.190 
and we can change the display type on

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:20.340 
and we can change the display type on
the<00:04:15.640> armature<00:04:16.120> to<00:04:18.180> wire<00:04:19.180> just<00:04:19.600> really<00:04:19.990> thin

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:20.350 
the armature to wire just really thin

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:23.910 
the armature to wire just really thin
there<00:04:21.570> so<00:04:22.570> we<00:04:22.720> can<00:04:22.930> see<00:04:23.170> we<00:04:23.350> can<00:04:23.380> take<00:04:23.650> a<00:04:23.680> good

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:23.920 
there so we can see we can take a good

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:28.020 
there so we can see we can take a good
look<00:04:24.100> at<00:04:24.310> this<00:04:26.100> and<00:04:27.100> then<00:04:27.490> we'll<00:04:27.610> just<00:04:27.790> rotate

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:28.030 
look at this and then we'll just rotate

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:32.700 
look at this and then we'll just rotate
that<00:04:28.540> and<00:04:28.810> you<00:04:29.500> can<00:04:29.680> see<00:04:29.860> how<00:04:29.890> that<00:04:30.150> surface<00:04:31.710> is

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:32.710 
that and you can see how that surface is

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:42.840 
that and you can see how that surface is
adapting<00:04:33.520> to<00:04:33.670> that<00:04:33.820> other<00:04:34.180> bone<00:04:41.490> so<00:04:42.490> this<00:04:42.670> is

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:42.850 
adapting to that other bone so this is

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:47.280 
adapting to that other bone so this is
really<00:04:43.300> just<00:04:43.690> to<00:04:43.780> introduce<00:04:44.320> the<00:04:45.840> idea<00:04:46.840> of

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:47.290 
really just to introduce the idea of

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:51.660 
really just to introduce the idea of
vertex<00:04:47.560> groups<00:04:48.180> wait<00:04:49.180> paint<00:04:49.510> and<00:04:50.460> how<00:04:51.460> they

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:51.670 
vertex groups wait paint and how they

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:55.470 
vertex groups wait paint and how they
relate<00:04:51.730> to<00:04:52.590> skinning<00:04:54.240> objects<00:04:55.240> to<00:04:55.390> an

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:55.480 
relate to skinning objects to an

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:58.980 
relate to skinning objects to an
armature<00:04:55.810> or<00:04:56.230> even<00:04:57.100> mesh<00:04:57.640> just<00:04:58.360> mesh<00:04:58.690> to<00:04:58.930> an

00:04:58.980 --> 00:04:58.990 
armature or even mesh just mesh to an

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:03.510 
armature or even mesh just mesh to an
armature<00:05:01.440> you<00:05:02.440> can<00:05:02.590> do<00:05:02.740> this<00:05:02.890> too<00:05:03.130> and<00:05:03.280> you<00:05:03.370> can

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:03.520 
armature you can do this too and you can

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:06.330 
armature you can do this too and you can
see<00:05:03.670> how<00:05:03.760> that<00:05:03.970> follows<00:05:04.390> so<00:05:05.020> now<00:05:05.260> this<00:05:05.770> surface

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:06.340 
see how that follows so now this surface

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:13.490 
see how that follows so now this surface
here<00:05:06.760> is<00:05:07.050> affected<00:05:08.050> by<00:05:08.290> this<00:05:08.950> other<00:05:09.310> bone<00:05:12.360> and

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:13.500 
here is affected by this other bone and

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:15.690 
here is affected by this other bone and
this<00:05:14.500> is<00:05:14.650> almost<00:05:14.950> the<00:05:15.130> end<00:05:15.280> of<00:05:15.400> this<00:05:15.520> tutorial

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:15.700 
this is almost the end of this tutorial

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:17.850 
this is almost the end of this tutorial
but<00:05:16.150> before<00:05:16.570> we<00:05:16.750> end<00:05:16.960> I<00:05:17.200> just<00:05:17.470> would<00:05:17.650> like<00:05:17.800> to

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:17.860 
but before we end I just would like to

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:21.060 
but before we end I just would like to
look<00:05:18.160> at<00:05:18.430> what<00:05:18.850> happens<00:05:19.240> with<00:05:19.690> the<00:05:20.070> modifier

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:21.070 
look at what happens with the modifier

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:24.990 
look at what happens with the modifier
stack<00:05:21.220> and<00:05:21.820> that's<00:05:22.600> when<00:05:23.020> you<00:05:23.200> do<00:05:23.760> make<00:05:24.760> that

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:25.000 
stack and that's when you do make that

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.210 
stack and that's when you do make that
skinning<00:05:25.540> when<00:05:25.900> you<00:05:25.990> do<00:05:26.110> skin<00:05:26.440> it<00:05:26.590> when<00:05:27.100> you

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:27.220 
skinning when you do skin it when you

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:31.290 
skinning when you do skin it when you
parent<00:05:27.640> the<00:05:27.930> the<00:05:28.930> armature<00:05:29.410> to<00:05:29.620> the<00:05:30.130> mesh<00:05:30.370> then

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:31.300 
parent the the armature to the mesh then

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:33.780 
parent the the armature to the mesh then
you'll<00:05:31.660> get<00:05:31.900> one<00:05:32.110> of<00:05:32.200> these<00:05:32.430> are<00:05:33.430> mature

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:33.790 
you'll get one of these are mature

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:44.940 
you'll get one of these are mature
modifiers<00:05:39.840> so<00:05:41.940> if<00:05:42.940> we<00:05:43.240> look<00:05:43.600> at<00:05:44.590> this<00:05:44.710> from<00:05:44.860> the

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:44.950 
modifiers so if we look at this from the

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:49.130 
modifiers so if we look at this from the
front<00:05:45.310> here<00:05:45.550> again<00:05:45.820> and<00:05:47.490> then<00:05:48.490> we<00:05:48.640> take<00:05:48.880> this

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:49.140 
front here again and then we take this

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:53.310 
front here again and then we take this
this<00:05:50.140> one<00:05:50.380> here<00:05:50.740> and<00:05:50.920> do<00:05:51.370> this<00:05:52.080> let's<00:05:53.080> say<00:05:53.200> we

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:53.320 
this one here and do this let's say we

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:58.380 
this one here and do this let's say we
can<00:05:53.470> set<00:05:53.680> this<00:05:53.860> in<00:05:54.100> the<00:05:54.480> rest<00:05:55.480> position<00:05:57.330> go<00:05:58.330> to

00:05:58.380 --> 00:05:58.390 
can set this in the rest position go to

00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:04.050 
can set this in the rest position go to
object<00:05:58.660> mode<00:06:00.780> and<00:06:01.780> I<00:06:02.140> want<00:06:02.740> to<00:06:02.950> copy<00:06:03.580> this

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:04.060 
object mode and I want to copy this

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:08.300 
object mode and I want to copy this
whole<00:06:04.540> thing<00:06:04.870> here

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:08.310 

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:10.880 

let's<00:06:09.120> turn<00:06:09.390> on<00:06:09.600> I<00:06:09.900> think<00:06:10.260> I<00:06:10.320> want<00:06:10.500> to<00:06:10.560> choose

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:10.890 
let's turn on I think I want to choose

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:13.340 
let's turn on I think I want to choose
this<00:06:11.130> I<00:06:11.370> want<00:06:11.580> to<00:06:11.610> turn<00:06:11.790> on<00:06:11.970> the<00:06:12.090> octahedral<00:06:12.810> so

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:13.350 
this I want to turn on the octahedral so

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:15.140 
this I want to turn on the octahedral so
I<00:06:13.380> can<00:06:13.590> see<00:06:13.740> a<00:06:13.770> little<00:06:13.920> bit<00:06:14.040> better<00:06:14.220> so<00:06:15.060> I've

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:15.150 
I can see a little bit better so I've

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:17.300 
I can see a little bit better so I've
selected<00:06:15.300> the<00:06:15.810> armature<00:06:16.290> and<00:06:16.560> I<00:06:16.920> can<00:06:17.130> select

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:17.310 
selected the armature and I can select

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:20.630 
selected the armature and I can select
one<00:06:17.640> of<00:06:17.670> the<00:06:17.850> objects<00:06:18.270> and<00:06:18.990> their<00:06:19.260> shift<00:06:19.830> d<00:06:20.280> for

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:20.640 
one of the objects and their shift d for

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:23.840 
one of the objects and their shift d for
duplication<00:06:21.740> change<00:06:22.740> to<00:06:22.860> the<00:06:22.950> translator<00:06:23.490> and

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:23.850 
duplication change to the translator and

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:29.660 
duplication change to the translator and
then<00:06:24.840> move<00:06:25.050> that<00:06:25.260> over<00:06:25.290> there<00:06:27.920> and<00:06:28.920> I'll<00:06:29.280> save

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:29.670 
then move that over there and I'll save

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:37.490 
then move that over there and I'll save
this<00:06:33.860> and<00:06:35.810> this<00:06:36.810> is<00:06:37.020> the<00:06:37.170> end<00:06:37.320> of<00:06:37.440> this
