00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:05.250
 hello knife friends and hello outdoor 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:07.859
 Freaks I want you two today 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:11.910
 Gas cookers imagine those from the low 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:15.240
 come in that budget segment 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.520
 China gas cooker shows here just once 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:21.620
 in 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:27.470
 this is one with three 

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:31.460
 Pads and electric ignition 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:33.870
 suitable for a screw cartridge the 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:38.070
 I would like to test now 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:46.200
 here is the other one that has four 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:50.390
 Pads and also this electro 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:53.820
 cylinder again with one still this one 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:55.050
 this screw where the gas volume 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.180
 can reduce 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.640
 the thing is also very solid and massive 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:03.180
 built so that's right here 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:05.399
 from a piece of aluminum that too 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.829
 aluminum that heroes stainless steel the 

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:09.929
 edition also and here one has such a 

00:01:07.829 --> 00:01:12.740
 electric clippers like lighter too 

00:01:09.929 --> 00:01:15.689
 once again covered with stainless steel 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:20.479
 simply as heat protection and also like 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:22.590
 this screw thread but that was since 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:28.369
 The two gas cookers and I have one here 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:32.189
 a butane propane mix gas cartridge 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:35.219
 with screw thread because that still exists 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:38.219
 in 250 he is 100 because there is a 250cc 

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:42.359
 and in 500 and there will be easy again 

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:45.119
 Gas stove screwed on and the beautiful 

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:47.159
 it is in this way with this 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:50.459
 you can win this at any time 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:52.770
 separate from each other and the pack size so 

00:01:50.459 --> 00:01:54.630
 make it small I fail 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:58.679
 I have half a liter of stainless steel here 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:00.770
 better they fit exactly pure and 

00:01:58.679 --> 00:02:04.469
 this has then on this 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:06.450
 this place so can just with times 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:08.160
 just intercepted with the four 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:15.640
 here at 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:22.600
 apropos it goes Ogunjimi bit 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:25.240
 tighten to unfold and press the button 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:27.330
 Fit it got the camera 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:32.650
 Of course everything is in the picture 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:37.540
 at the angle too small times to see if 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:41.800
 I get that further away that's how it looks 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:45.790
 Alright, so of course one 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:49.950
 a bit diagonally here and there you go 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:49.950
 do not just open 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:02.209
 where you still turn here now 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:10.989
 or halt also that it is therefore 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:12.040
 finally the fingers 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:16.299
 work great I have that 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:20.769
 of course already tested and that 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:21.900
 The same would be the case here 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:25.409
 his 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:29.799
 You have to look again if you are 

00:03:25.409 --> 00:03:35.200
 rather four pads need or 

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:36.609
 Three each decide for themselves like that 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.019
 I gladly think that's one 

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:39.459
 maybe a bit wider for one 

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:40.120
 pan or for a big pot 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:43.139
 ideal 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:47.099
 it's a bit smaller, of course 

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:50.260
 So that's a difference 

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:52.599
 the things cost six euros 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:55.120
 he has six euros cost that has faith 

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:56.680
 I cost five euros so on the internet 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:59.470
 looked a bit so there is 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:02.349
 which for 35 euros and more 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:03.549
 So I do not see the added value so 

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:03.970
 why I spend so much money there 

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:06.010
 should 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:07.959
 The Chinese people are good at it as well 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:09.970
 sees and the thing fulfills its purpose 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:11.440
 as well and there are these cartouches here 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:14.290
 the cost is 5 euros or 4 euros 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:17.530
 such a small one costs 399 and the 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:19.840
 next larger would be 595 and the real 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:21.370
 that's why he keeps forever that's it 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:23.400
 yes , yes, it's not like that again 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:25.990
 cooking is longer and therefore 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:28.570
 I personally do not see the added value 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:30.120
 me a gas stove for 35 and more euros 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:33.750
 to buy 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:33.750
 make Modena mesh to 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:45.880
 then so much gas emanates then 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:48.940
 Of course not immediately 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:52.060
 I know a little bit so much but how 

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:53.050
 I said green parts first 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:55.680
 cook a coffee 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:05:04.210
 I'm here so'n in instant coffee 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:07.300
 Jacob and two each in a cafÃ© and 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:09.300
 coffee better gibbs was 3 in one with 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:13.150
 sugar but I did not admit it 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:15.310
 and yes, there is now ok 

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:17.169
 was happy that he be seen 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:20.610
 have and look forward to comments and likes 

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:20.610
 Of course I'm fine 

00:05:22.529 --> 00:05:27.539
 as you can see now cooks that 

00:05:25.469 --> 00:05:29.770
 It does not even last two minutes 

00:05:27.539 --> 00:05:32.129
 two and a half minutes took about 

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:34.439
 and the water cooks good harmony 

00:05:32.129 --> 00:05:39.069
 close but again 

00:05:34.439 --> 00:05:43.360
 turn it off and that's it 

00:05:39.069 --> 00:05:44.680
 been okay with this sweet gas stove 

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:48.430
 I'm going to get my times here 

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:49.090
 make coffee and then I will be the 

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:52.229
 relish 

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:52.229
 So does do well
