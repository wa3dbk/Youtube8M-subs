00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:17.560 
get rid of it I plan on keeping it
through<00:02:16.040> the<00:02:16.160> holidays<00:02:16.580> and<00:02:16.820> I'll<00:02:17.360> take<00:02:17.540> it

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:17.570 
through the holidays and I'll take it

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:28.140 
through the holidays and I'll take it
out<00:02:22.540> I<00:02:23.709> just<00:02:24.709> want<00:02:24.860> to<00:02:24.950> show<00:02:25.070> you<00:02:25.130> in<00:02:25.310> the<00:02:25.400> front

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:34.250 

my<00:02:29.150> hair<00:02:29.360> stops<00:02:29.660> here

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.020 

so<00:02:35.260> I<00:02:35.530> think<00:02:35.860> it's<00:02:35.980> starting<00:02:36.610> to<00:02:36.700> take<00:02:36.850> me<00:02:37.000> a

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
so I think it's starting to take me a

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:38.460 
so I think it's starting to take me a
really<00:02:37.450> long<00:02:37.480> time<00:02:37.840> to<00:02:37.900> braid<00:02:38.260> my<00:02:38.440> hair

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
really long time to braid my hair

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.030 
really long time to braid my hair
because<00:02:39.750> it's<00:02:40.750> a<00:02:41.110> lot<00:02:41.320> longer<00:02:41.500> than<00:02:41.710> it<00:02:41.920> was

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
because it's a lot longer than it was

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.160 
because it's a lot longer than it was
before<00:02:42.220> I<00:02:42.730> used<00:02:43.570> to<00:02:43.600> be<00:02:43.720> able<00:02:43.780> to<00:02:43.900> bring<00:02:44.050> my

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
before I used to be able to bring my

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:46.200 
before I used to be able to bring my
hair<00:02:44.350> in<00:02:44.440> about<00:02:44.830> six<00:02:45.130> or<00:02:45.310> seven<00:02:45.610> hours<00:02:45.700> so<00:02:46.060> I'm

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:46.210 
hair in about six or seven hours so I'm

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:50.640 
hair in about six or seven hours so I'm
seriously<00:02:48.540> it<00:02:49.540> just<00:02:49.600> takes<00:02:49.990> too<00:02:50.260> long<00:02:50.290> I

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650 
seriously it just takes too long I

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:53.340
