00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 so , welcome to the fourth 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:06.779
 and last final stand map we in the 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:08.940
 cde can test and you are allowed to see it 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:11.780
 already it is again a snow map that 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:14.130
 are now three snow maps in a dlc 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:16.289
 I know everyone is still screaming snow 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.640
 maps and also at night maps i know now 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.170
 just not if it makes it a bit now 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.580
 have exaggerated now have one 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.410
 Battlefield has a lot of snow 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.019
 mips i think if we join later 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.980
 include in any case, this map is 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:31.140
 I'll tell you in two parts 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:33.270
 area goes the mega action and im 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.070
 he is a bit different in other areas 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.360
 I will not say boring but there 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.010
 does not happen much 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.280
 and that is what you are seeing here 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.950
 that the digital where not very special 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.289
 a lot happens and indeed there is in the 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.460
 In the middle of the mep this mountain sees 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.860
 because you just wonderful so not 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.989
 relatively big but there is the action there 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:56.370
 I'm not sure what exactly 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:58.949
 is again such a factory building 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.270
 hideaway hidden in the mountain where 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.739
 something would be made on everyone 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.149
 case are several rooms you can see 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.030
 right now and there is definitely one 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.799
 it is just like that against the outside 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.740
 I 'm going to say boring 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:12.210
 because there's something else going on 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.920
 in the two rounds I am now 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.659
 was in the middle of the played 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.950
 action if we make points if 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.650
 you want to do kills then you should 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.210
 always instruments run the try 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.520
 to hold and defend 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.710
 because sooner or later everyone will come 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.080
 because time is so out there a bit 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.329
 the man just runs from one to 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.590
 other flag and takes it off and 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.479
 to do one time a tank 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.369
 Maybe two maybe meant 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:38.909
 you also turn off a heli with the rpg or 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:40.740
 there is also something like that there are 22 tech 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:44.340
 cell phones and I think every team has 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.750
 another jet or something like that and there you can 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.310
 you might shoot something but me 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.880
 believe for jet player is not so here 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:54.060
 really mega action does not make such a mega 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:56.729
 a lot of fun and for every aviator I know 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:59.460
 Also not if you have so many jakits 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:02.369
 because stop the action already like 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:04.259
 said inside going out there running one 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:05.310
 stop from flag to flag there is a long time 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:07.320
 nothing you should do it one 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.090
 snowmobile or something similar 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.250
 take it off relatively quickly 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.190
 Flag to flag comes but earlier or 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.420
 Later I tried it 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:16.400
 outside to run but it was easy 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:19.430
 nothing there was simply nothing although the 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.480
 it was 64 x server full I'm easy 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:22.070
 only now and then on the opponent 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.420
 met the possibly of the panda because 

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:25.970
 he hid himself or that 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.860
 wanted to try out the action is on 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:31.340
 the entrances to the mountain are there 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:34.130
 several and in the mountain in and out like 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:37.190
 said so h that is the map is 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:39.410
 somehow like it's big big 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:42.020
 but should not have been so big 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:44.630
 People like to play cars 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:46.070
 we will not have so much fun here 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:47.630
 do not find so much action because stop 

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:49.130
 as I said the action goes downhill and 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:50.620
 You can not get in there with vehicles 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:52.940
 Although you can with a tank 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:54.230
 you can also drive in with it 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:56.180
 fly through 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:57.950
 but the chance that one from one to the 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:00.740
 the other end is not very special 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:02.570
 far is pretty low because there 

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:04.970
 everything is tight and throws once 

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:07.370
 three times four down or lines what he 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:09.740
 everything was full of minus 4 and everything 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:13.180
 there are rpgs i believe people like 

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:15.950
 so moderately play vehicle 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:17.900
 will not find so much fun here 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:19.550
 But infantry in the mountain makes everyone 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:20.600
 a lot of fun and so on 

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:23.120
 I say goodbye I hope you 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:25.670
 have had the impressions of hama 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:27.290
 Please write your opinion 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:28.610
 this map or the other maps in 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:30.920
 the comments which you can find on 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:32.510
 best and so I say goodbye 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:33.620
 now if you like it then 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:35.270
 I look forward to my own evaluation 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:39.160
 otherwise we will meet again tomorrow 

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:39.160
 until the next video until then
