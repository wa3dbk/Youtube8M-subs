 new scott builder will be discussed 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.699
 of a team that many have 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.100
 asked to do that is the major league 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.449
 soccer then the championship mls 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.160
 American 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:32.399
 I made this team that actually 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:35.100
 a bsg that we say as values to 89 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:38.790
 90 speed bar so it's really 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:41.760
 incredible is used in principle 4 4 ​​1 1 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.559
 and then the 4 4 ​​2 but still they are two bikes 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.980
 of substantially very similar then 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:49.770
 relatively little change 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.570
 obviously the goalkeeper used a 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.460
 another goalkeeper than this one 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.410
 championship because this league does not 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.539
 they literally drive me crazy 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.820
 what is there to say about the players 

00:00:56.539 --> 00:01:00.960
 lately mostly silver and bronze 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:03.030
 cost madness 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.920
 the wrath of god so maybe it's not the 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.680
 best time to become a team 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:10.200
 so let's start right away with the goalkeeper 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:13.619
 which is one of the best in the game and it is 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:16.170
 without a doubt howard which obviously does not 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.820
 there are many adjectives to describe 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.979
 this player really fantastic 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.630
 everything can be said and has not 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.299
 even exaggerated statistics if 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.369
 let's look on the paper but really it is 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.900
 a power of the madonna really there 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.540
 bad advice because it is one of the 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.729
 my favorite goalkeepers of this game 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:35.070
 then we go here in defense we put 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.740
 mls championship if we put ourselves 15 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:40.220
 years to find the players we put ourselves 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:44.220
 that 15 years to find that the championship 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:46.320
 yadlin costs madness 30,000 credits e 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.840
 passes for a right-back who is then a 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:52.560
 68 so neither 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:55.380
 in 74 to understand each other but two goals in five 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.929
 start this at type 90 and shoot 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:01.409
 I swear an innate long shot I don't know 

00:01:57.929 --> 00:02:04.560
 hidden unknown statistics for 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:06.659
 which really is unbelievable made me 22 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.090
 longshot goal from a corner kick 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:11.160
 that is, it is beaten more than anything else 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.049
 they were really very beautiful is a 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.239
 very decisive player who drives a 

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:16.709
 bang is strong however also in defense 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:19.230
 because thanks to his speed he manages to 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:20.730
 however, recovering is not very high 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:22.110
 a good physique so it really is a 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:25.799
 great player who still has a 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:29.519
 disproportionate price as indeed not 

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:31.470
 both he that is good in defense or para 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:34.110
 central defender who unfortunately does not have 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:36.390
 a very high defense value but 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.569
 compensates however with its speed the 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:43.980
 his work his height and his physique 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:46.110
 but above all we have win that now 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:48.720
 here as you see in these images I have it 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:50.810
 paid 83 thousand credits but who can a month 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:54.060
 does now from what I've noticed 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:57.329
 static over 200,000 credits which is one 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:58.739
 madness that cannot be paid like this 

00:02:57.329 --> 00:03:01.910
 so now I'm going to see 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:06.510
 how much it costs win because it really is 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:09.060
 crazy the 188 thousand credits thing 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:11.420
 100 thousand more obviously talking about 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:15.239
 playstation is very strong because it is 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:16.739
 fast and has a good anyway 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:19.410
 defense and above all in the physical though 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:21.209
 really at an exaggerated price 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:23.400
 then another exaggerated price but 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:26.669
 however played it is very good and to ski and 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:29.220
 acea ski which is an excellent fullback 

00:03:26.669 --> 00:03:31.950
 fast with a good dribbling a 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:33.359
 good defense value and that's it 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:34.739
 basically two stars weak foot 

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:36.810
 and they are not at most the price is 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:38.849
 however, he is a good player 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:43.470
 we move to midfield where I have 

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:45.930
 used jones to the right which is great 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:48.120
 in the sense that it is fast and very complete 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:50.099
 as a player with good shooting speed 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.870
 strong passage also in defense e 

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:53.069
 especially in physical player that i 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:54.480
 he made a goal 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:56.849
 consider these five games 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:59.940
 were three quid of the opponent 

00:03:56.849 --> 00:04:05.670
 so let's say you have three games 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:08.550
 complete and therefore a lot of data is a bit 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:09.840
 of cabbage in the sense probably many 

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:12.240
 players would have scored more goals and 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:14.400
 especially more assists during 

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:16.500
 matches which in any case to be paid 1 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:19.140
 quoted however jones is excellent as 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:21.000
 midfielder defender as great 

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:22.740
 even if a departmental mate who is not 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.650
 I changed the role because I didn't 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:27.900
 changed the agreement that is alonso player 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:29.880
 very very similar I must say maybe less 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:32.640
 shot for him but a goal and an assist 5 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:36.870
 matches and therefore really great 

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:40.380
 then external right player kato that 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:43.890
 it is very fast and basically enough to 

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:46.110
 a no however a good shot though like 

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:50.460
 I always say the exteriors don't serve 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:52.410
 much in this this scares then yes 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:53.940
 may also want to do without but I have 

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:57.240
 wanted to make the team faster 

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:59.580
 possible of the mls and so oh well I have 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:01.410
 due to force exteriors is 

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:03.210
 however good in the sense a good one 

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:06.000
 sin player who has only three stars 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:09.530
 ability 3 salts 3 on skill though 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:12.480
 however it is not bad and they cost a lot 

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:14.940
 while as a left external but who is 

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:17.250
 really strong very very strong too 

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:18.960
 if then eight games 0 goals from zero ass 

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:21.750
 but I repeat the outsiders really do 

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:24.750
 little in this 94 speed game 

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:28.169
 really a lot of shooting also also the 

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:30.419
 dribbling is good, I would say with 46 

00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:33.950
 the skill goes instead with the couple 

00:05:30.419 --> 00:05:37.980
 of truly incredible attackers ie 

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:38.520
 oba oba martins as striker of 

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:41.310
 right 

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:43.740
 obviously not considered the five 

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:46.340
 matches with 2 goals and two assists would be 

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:49.740
 There were certainly many more goals for him 

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:52.860
 its positivity is five-star 

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:54.660
 weak foot instead its negativity e 

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:57.030
 normal normal lurgan which is not the 

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:59.430
 maximum of life so it is also not 

00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:01.620
 easy to make him snap forward 

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:03.240
 however, players are excellent 

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:07.140
 ie very fast player 

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:08.820
 dribbling and above all a great shot 

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:12.950
 precisely that compensated by the five 

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:15.960
 stars for it is weak and finally we find 

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:18.270
 youth transfer that I wanted to try 

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:21.120
 so unfortunately for fun too 

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:23.789
 abnormal normal so a little like that 

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:26.700
 ward of this team of this attack 

00:06:23.789 --> 00:06:29.039
 laurel used as he draws sides 

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:31.500
 of the team in 4 4 1 1 however it is 

00:06:29.039 --> 00:06:34.080
 very good as his only player 

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:36.390
 sin is obviously his body 

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:38.039
 height as it should be if it were 

00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:39.300
 a little higher if he had a little more 

00:06:38.039 --> 00:06:42.870
 physical would be really unstoppable 

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:44.430
 very much like barbs anyway 

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:45.780
 raga the team is this a team 

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:47.479
 very prolific because in addition to 

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:50.250
 midfielders also attacked 

00:06:47.479 --> 00:06:52.350
 mark and above all the right back 

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:54.600
 so I invite you to try it when i 

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:57.979
 prices of course will drop many of 

00:06:54.600 --> 00:07:00.960
 you asked me to make a team 

00:06:57.979 --> 00:07:02.580
 a little more expensive than the last ones 

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:04.169
 that I made him a team will come 

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:05.880
 maybe with the players I already have in 

00:07:04.169 --> 00:07:07.770
 club now let's see what we can 

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:09.750
 do call you as always leave a 

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:11.539
 nice thumb up a nice like give if
