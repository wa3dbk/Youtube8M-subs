00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.880 
are somehow bigger than the apple
lightning<00:01:50.640> cable<00:01:51.180> so<00:01:52.110> that's<00:01:52.380> really<00:01:52.680> great

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
lightning cable so that's really great

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.560 
lightning cable so that's really great
that's<00:01:53.189> big<00:01:53.460> and<00:01:53.490> thought<00:01:53.880> of<00:01:53.909> that<00:01:54.090> when

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
that's big and thought of that when

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.530 
that's big and thought of that when
designing<00:01:55.020> this<00:01:55.229> case<00:01:55.500> so<00:01:56.490> overall<00:01:57.119> the<00:01:57.329> case

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
designing this case so overall the case

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.899 
designing this case so overall the case
feels<00:01:57.810> really<00:01:58.079> good<00:01:58.320> in<00:01:58.380> the<00:01:58.619> hand<00:01:58.790> thanks<00:01:59.790> to

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
feels really good in the hand thanks to

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.420 
feels really good in the hand thanks to
the<00:02:00.030> soft<00:02:00.270> touch<00:02:00.479> finish<00:02:00.810> in<00:02:01.200> it<00:02:01.320> it's<00:02:02.130> very

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
the soft touch finish in it it's very

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.030 
the soft touch finish in it it's very
slim<00:02:02.820> and<00:02:03.060> lightweight<00:02:03.270> I<00:02:03.750> really<00:02:04.680> love<00:02:04.829> the

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
slim and lightweight I really love the

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.850 
slim and lightweight I really love the
form-fitting<00:02:05.310> design<00:02:05.990> to<00:02:06.990> me<00:02:07.140> the<00:02:07.380> case<00:02:07.590> looks

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
form-fitting design to me the case looks

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.680 
form-fitting design to me the case looks
very<00:02:08.129> similar<00:02:08.280> to<00:02:08.610> speak<00:02:09.060> and<00:02:09.209> slim<00:02:09.509> armor

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
very similar to speak and slim armor

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.290 
very similar to speak and slim armor
case<00:02:10.080> which<00:02:10.470> I<00:02:10.679> revealed<00:02:11.129> a<00:02:11.220> while<00:02:11.400> back

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
case which I revealed a while back

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.090 
case which I revealed a while back
there<00:02:12.750> is<00:02:12.870> also<00:02:13.050> another<00:02:13.230> version<00:02:13.710> of<00:02:13.950> this

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100 
there is also another version of this

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.460 
there is also another version of this
case<00:02:14.430> called<00:02:14.910> just<00:02:15.330> the<00:02:15.510> ultrafeed<00:02:16.050> without

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
case called just the ultrafeed without

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.860 
case called just the ultrafeed without
the<00:02:16.620> S<00:02:16.740> at<00:02:16.980> the<00:02:17.010> end<00:02:17.190> that<00:02:18.150> one<00:02:18.420> looks<00:02:18.660> very

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
the S at the end that one looks very

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.750 
the S at the end that one looks very
similar<00:02:19.020> to<00:02:19.290> speak<00:02:19.680> against<00:02:19.890> ultra<00:02:20.310> thin<00:02:20.490> air

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
similar to speak against ultra thin air

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.450 
similar to speak against ultra thin air
case<00:02:21.060> so<00:02:22.050> thanks<00:02:22.470> for<00:02:22.620> watching<00:02:22.980> and<00:02:23.190> I'll<00:02:23.430> see

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:23.460 
case so thanks for watching and I'll see

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:27.830 
case so thanks for watching and I'll see
you<00:02:23.670> again<00:02:23.790> next<00:02:24.180> time<00:02:24.830> bye
