are<00:02:04.590> so<00:02:04.770> high<00:02:04.979> that<00:02:05.420> rusty<00:02:06.420> damper<00:02:06.869> that<00:02:06.899> we

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
are so high that rusty damper that we

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.010 
are so high that rusty damper that we
just<00:02:07.320> looked<00:02:07.560> at<00:02:07.740> is<00:02:07.890> robbing<00:02:08.340> you<00:02:08.369> blind<00:02:09.020> what

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
just looked at is robbing you blind what

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.290 
just looked at is robbing you blind what
you<00:02:10.170> need<00:02:10.470> is<00:02:10.739> a<00:02:10.770> damper<00:02:11.340> that<00:02:11.520> replaces<00:02:12.090> that

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
you need is a damper that replaces that

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.170 
you need is a damper that replaces that
one<00:02:12.510> and

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
one and

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.449 
one and
feels<00:02:13.450> tight<00:02:13.810> like<00:02:14.170> a<00:02:14.200> storm<00:02:14.769> door<00:02:15.040> for<00:02:15.310> your

let's<00:02:16.989> take<00:02:17.170> a<00:02:17.200> look<00:02:18.689> here's<00:02:19.689> the<00:02:19.750> solution

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
let's take a look here's the solution

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.759 
let's take a look here's the solution
Alamance<00:02:21.340> energy-saving<00:02:22.180> damper<00:02:22.659> the<00:02:22.840> first

thing<00:02:23.950> I<00:02:24.010> want<00:02:24.219> you<00:02:24.310> to<00:02:24.340> notice<00:02:24.609> is<00:02:24.819> that<00:02:24.849> this

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:25.209 
thing I want you to notice is that this

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:27.660 
thing I want you to notice is that this
