00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:06.630
 for those who are very thin and want to increase the size of their 

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:10.820
 muscles should consume higher percentage of calories but 

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:15.280
 At the same time, it is important to influence the increase in Moscow by 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:18.349
 Intense weight training routine 

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:23.720
 to gain muscle mass is recommended in the case of males increase their 

00:00:23.719 --> 00:00:29.059
 caloric intake in 500 to a thousand calories and for women between 250 and 500 

00:00:29.059 --> 00:00:30.949
 calories 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:35.219
 To continue with this plan correctly it is recommended to upload weekly 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.160
 about a quarter of a kilo 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.570
 the important thing is not to get to increase a kilo per week because surely 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:46.300
 the percentage of fat in the body is increased and it is necessary to lower the 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:49.080
 amount of food consumed 

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:53.530
 proteins play a central role in muscle growth, however, 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:57.430
 we must leave aside and there to pay close attention to the caloric intake 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:01.640
 because if it is reduced, the same protein will be used 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.150
 the mistake of many thin people who want to increase their muscles is 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:11.410
 consume many proteins but control them and you should only consume what 

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:14.430
 necessary depending on the person and their metabolism 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:18.540
 some proteins for muscle growth 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.200
 Red meat 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.600
 skinless chicken breast 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.689
 complete new skinless turkey breast 

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:28.550
 low-fat cheeses 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:30.420
 skim milk 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.570
 low-fat yogurt and so on 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:36.770
 we all know that weight training works but which is the best 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:38.880
 way to make it a routine 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.350
 it has been shown that for muscle enhancement to be possible the stimulus is 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.100
 important this happens when the muscle cells are damaged 

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:52.110
 the body responds by increasing protein synthesis and our muscles 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.830
 they get bigger and stronger 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:59.350
 so you must submit your muscles to a more demanding weight training 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:04.670
 not exaggerated you can not lift a couple of light bars and hope that those 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:06.490
 muscles that are left 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:11.640
 Weight training should last at least 30 minutes you must perform 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:16.140
 series that do not allow you to do more than 12 to 15 repetitions and occasionally 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.569
 perform series of 4 to 6 repetitions 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:23.510
 The most important key is to have patience during the process 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.329
 have a firm decision 

00:02:25.329 --> 00:02:29.129
 be consistent in the training routine and the protein diet 

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:32.039
 that will help us gain muscle mass 

00:02:32.039 --> 00:02:36.399
