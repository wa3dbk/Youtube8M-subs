whole idea of strategy videos and so I'm
going<00:00:59.100> to<00:00:59.129> go<00:00:59.280> ahead<00:00:59.340> and<00:00:59.430> start<00:00:59.699> slowing<00:01:00.000> some

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
going to go ahead and start slowing some

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.029 
going to go ahead and start slowing some
things<00:01:00.510> down<00:01:00.719> a<00:01:00.750> little<00:01:00.840> bit<00:01:01.170> give<00:01:01.649> the<00:01:01.829> view

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
things down a little bit give the view

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.830 
things down a little bit give the view
to<00:01:02.129> everybody<00:01:02.550> and<00:01:02.969> so<00:01:03.120> what<00:01:03.239> this<00:01:03.390> is<00:01:03.449> is<00:01:03.629> this

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
to everybody and so what this is is this

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.630 
to everybody and so what this is is this
is<00:01:04.080> going<00:01:04.320> to<00:01:04.409> be<00:01:04.500> at<00:01:04.680> aarons<00:01:05.100> response

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
is going to be at aarons response

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.990 
is going to be at aarons response
possibly<00:01:06.360> to<00:01:06.869> a<00:01:06.900> Protoss<00:01:07.530> going<00:01:08.100> some<00:01:08.580> kind<00:01:08.880> of

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
possibly to a Protoss going some kind of

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.690 
possibly to a Protoss going some kind of
three<00:01:09.299> or<00:01:09.450> four<00:01:09.750> gate<00:01:10.020> on<00:01:10.260> you<00:01:10.470> now<00:01:11.340> of<00:01:11.520> course

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
three or four gate on you now of course

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.210 
three or four gate on you now of course
most<00:01:12.390> I<00:01:12.720> like<00:01:12.900> xored<00:01:13.200> they<00:01:13.470> have<00:01:13.680> kind<00:01:13.950> of<00:01:14.040> the

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
most I like xored they have kind of the

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.490 
most I like xored they have kind of the
roach<00:01:14.400> rush<00:01:14.729> response<00:01:15.299> to<00:01:15.630> it<00:01:15.780> so<00:01:16.200> that<00:01:16.380> it

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
roach rush response to it so that it

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.480 
roach rush response to it so that it
they<00:01:16.799> get<00:01:17.009> an<00:01:17.159> attack<00:01:17.490> right<00:01:17.820> before<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:19.490> the

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
they get an attack right before the the

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.429 
they get an attack right before the the
warp<00:01:20.759> gate<00:01:21.000> tech<00:01:21.330> actually<00:01:21.750> finishes<00:01:22.200> so<00:01:22.350> they

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
warp gate tech actually finishes so they

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.440 
warp gate tech actually finishes so they
can't<00:01:22.680> really<00:01:22.740> warp<00:01:23.070> in<00:01:23.220> units<00:01:23.880> very<00:01:24.119> quickly

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
can't really warp in units very quickly

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:25.969 
can't really warp in units very quickly
and<00:01:24.750> so<00:01:25.080> you<00:01:25.140> kind<00:01:25.380> of<00:01:25.439> are<00:01:25.530> able<00:01:25.710> to<00:01:25.770> catch

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
and so you kind of are able to catch

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.890 
and so you kind of are able to catch
them<00:01:26.220> with<00:01:26.340> their<00:01:26.460> pants<00:01:26.670> down<00:01:26.790> and<00:01:27.180> so<00:01:27.750> this

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
them with their pants down and so this

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.480 
them with their pants down and so this
is<00:01:28.020> going<00:01:28.170> to<00:01:28.229> be<00:01:28.350> kind<00:01:28.470> of<00:01:28.560> a<00:01:28.650> Terran<00:01:29.070> response

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
is going to be kind of a Terran response

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.300 
is going to be kind of a Terran response
and<00:01:29.700> it's<00:01:29.820> basically<00:01:30.650> it's<00:01:31.650> going<00:01:31.829> to<00:01:31.890> be<00:01:32.009> two

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
and it's basically it's going to be two

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.310 
and it's basically it's going to be two
Marines<00:01:32.670> and<00:01:32.880> two<00:01:32.939> Marauders<00:01:33.600> basically<00:01:34.140> that

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
Marines and two Marauders basically that

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.179 
Marines and two Marauders basically that
go<00:01:34.500> in<00:01:34.740> and<00:01:34.970> kind<00:01:35.970> of<00:01:36.090> handle<00:01:36.540> this<00:01:36.659> army<00:01:37.140> so<00:01:37.560> we

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
go in and kind of handle this army so we

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.130 
go in and kind of handle this army so we
have<00:01:38.340> our<00:01:38.369> Protoss<00:01:38.880> player<00:01:39.210> he<00:01:39.479> is<00:01:39.509> going<00:01:39.990> to

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
have our Protoss player he is going to

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.620 
have our Protoss player he is going to
be<00:01:40.259> slick<00:01:40.860> and<00:01:41.070> he<00:01:41.820> is<00:01:41.909> spawning<00:01:42.150> the<00:01:42.329> bottom

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
be slick and he is spawning the bottom

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.510 
be slick and he is spawning the bottom
right<00:01:42.810> hand<00:01:42.840> position<00:01:43.439> and<00:01:43.619> our<00:01:43.860> Terran

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
right hand position and our Terran

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.880 
right hand position and our Terran
player<00:01:44.670> uh<00:01:44.790> I'm<00:01:45.420> thinking<00:01:45.960> hobbin<00:01:46.380> or<00:01:46.560> Hoban

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
player uh I'm thinking hobbin or Hoban

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.219 
player uh I'm thinking hobbin or Hoban
something<00:01:47.460> like<00:01:47.579> that<00:01:47.810> is<00:01:48.810> going<00:01:48.930> to<00:01:49.020> be<00:01:49.110> our

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
something like that is going to be our

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:50.749 
something like that is going to be our
blue<00:01:49.439> Terran<00:01:49.860> player<00:01:49.979> and<00:01:50.220> of<00:01:50.250> course<00:01:50.460> this<00:01:50.579> is

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
blue Terran player and of course this is

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.429 
blue Terran player and of course this is
a<00:01:50.790> ladder<00:01:51.030> match<00:01:51.149> and<00:01:51.600> so<00:01:51.930> I<00:01:51.960> want<00:01:52.140> to<00:01:52.200> go<00:01:52.259> in<00:01:52.350> to

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
a ladder match and so I want to go in to

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.560 
a ladder match and so I want to go in to
thank<00:01:53.100> him<00:01:53.280> for<00:01:53.520> sending<00:01:53.670> this<00:01:53.939> into<00:01:54.270> me<00:01:54.390> and

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
thank him for sending this into me and

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.179 
thank him for sending this into me and
this<00:01:54.869> is<00:01:54.990> the<00:01:55.110> way<00:01:55.229> that<00:01:55.380> he<00:01:55.530> kind<00:01:55.710> of<00:01:55.740> responds

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
this is the way that he kind of responds

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:57.709 
this is the way that he kind of responds
at<00:01:56.340> a<00:01:56.369> low<00:01:56.549> level<00:01:56.579> because<00:01:57.060> a<00:01:57.090> lot<00:01:57.299> of<00:01:57.329> protest

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
at a low level because a lot of protest

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:00.350 
at a low level because a lot of protest
players<00:01:57.990> are<00:01:58.310> doing<00:01:59.310> for<00:01:59.549> gate<00:01:59.790> at<00:01:59.969> this<00:02:00.180> level

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
players are doing for gate at this level

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.240 
players are doing for gate at this level
that's<00:02:00.630> just<00:02:00.930> what<00:02:01.320> happens<00:02:01.770> that's<00:02:01.950> what

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
that's just what happens that's what

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.109 
that's just what happens that's what
people<00:02:02.520> do<00:02:02.700> so<00:02:04.070> with<00:02:05.070> that<00:02:05.250> in<00:02:05.399> mind<00:02:05.430> this<00:02:06.000> is

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
people do so with that in mind this is

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:07.429 
people do so with that in mind this is
going<00:02:06.270> to<00:02:06.329> be<00:02:06.420> a<00:02:06.450> strategy<00:02:06.840> so<00:02:06.990> there's<00:02:07.200> the

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
going to be a strategy so there's the

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.380 
going to be a strategy so there's the
three<00:02:08.099> gates<00:02:08.369> and<00:02:08.670> now<00:02:08.759> here's<00:02:09.000> the<00:02:09.119> fourth

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
three gates and now here's the fourth

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.420 
three gates and now here's the fourth
gate<00:02:09.569> going<00:02:09.899> up<00:02:10.050> and<00:02:10.229> so<00:02:10.709> at<00:02:10.920> this<00:02:11.069> point<00:02:11.280> in

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
gate going up and so at this point in

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.870 
gate going up and so at this point in
time

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:11.880 
time

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:13.490 
time
is<00:02:11.910> going<00:02:12.030> to<00:02:12.090> be<00:02:12.210> setting<00:02:12.630> down<00:02:12.810> his<00:02:12.870> second

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
is going to be setting down his second

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.800 
is going to be setting down his second
barracks<00:02:13.800> he<00:02:14.610> went<00:02:14.820> ahead<00:02:14.910> and<00:02:15.270> is<00:02:15.570> getting

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
barracks he went ahead and is getting

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.290 
barracks he went ahead and is getting
concussive<00:02:16.290> shells<00:02:16.590> which<00:02:16.890> are<00:02:17.010> so

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300 
concussive shells which are so

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.760 
concussive shells which are so
phenomenal<00:02:18.300> against<00:02:18.660> early<00:02:19.020> gateway<00:02:19.410> units

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
phenomenal against early gateway units

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:21.710 
phenomenal against early gateway units
because<00:02:20.100> zealots<00:02:20.550> just<00:02:20.760> can't<00:02:21.030> run<00:02:21.210> away<00:02:21.330> once

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
because zealots just can't run away once

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.540 
because zealots just can't run away once
concussive<00:02:22.080> shells<00:02:22.320> is<00:02:22.500> done<00:02:22.710> so<00:02:23.190> it's<00:02:23.340> almost

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
concussive shells is done so it's almost

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:27.200 
concussive shells is done so it's almost
kind<00:02:23.850> of<00:02:23.970> like<00:02:24.030> a<00:02:24.360> two<00:02:25.200> marine<00:02:25.500> to<00:02:26.210> Marauder

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:27.210 
kind of like a two marine to Marauder

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:29.750 
kind of like a two marine to Marauder
concussive<00:02:27.840> shells<00:02:28.170> timing<00:02:28.800> attack<00:02:29.160> is<00:02:29.430> I

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
concussive shells timing attack is I

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.280 
concussive shells timing attack is I
think<00:02:30.000> more<00:02:30.360> maybe<00:02:30.570> a<00:02:30.690> better<00:02:30.930> way<00:02:31.050> to

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
think more maybe a better way to

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.540 
think more maybe a better way to
describe<00:02:32.190> it<00:02:32.670> but<00:02:32.790> we<00:02:32.940> do<00:02:33.090> see<00:02:33.330> that<00:02:33.540> there<00:02:34.260> are

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:34.550 
describe it but we do see that there are

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:37.160 
describe it but we do see that there are
there's<00:02:35.550> one<00:02:35.760> marine<00:02:36.000> one<00:02:36.450> Marauder<00:02:36.780> and<00:02:37.050> then

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
there's one marine one Marauder and then

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:38.660 
there's one marine one Marauder and then
there's<00:02:37.350> the<00:02:37.620> other<00:02:37.650> Marauder<00:02:38.160> one<00:02:38.400> marine

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
there's the other Marauder one marine

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.490 
there's the other Marauder one marine
another<00:02:39.120> barracks<00:02:39.480> is<00:02:39.690> coming<00:02:40.140> all<00:02:40.290> the<00:02:40.470> way

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
another barracks is coming all the way

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.350 
another barracks is coming all the way
and<00:02:40.860> so<00:02:41.190> we<00:02:41.310> should<00:02:41.550> probably<00:02:41.730> be<00:02:42.120> seeing

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
and so we should probably be seeing

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.870 
and so we should probably be seeing
units<00:02:43.110> continue<00:02:43.440> to<00:02:43.710> be<00:02:43.800> rallied<00:02:44.250> but<00:02:44.640> he<00:02:44.760> is

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
units continue to be rallied but he is

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.280 
units continue to be rallied but he is
going<00:02:45.030> to<00:02:45.150> be<00:02:45.240> pushing<00:02:45.480> out<00:02:45.720> here<00:02:45.930> just<00:02:46.080> right

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
going to be pushing out here just right

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:47.780 
going to be pushing out here just right
after<00:02:46.680> the<00:02:46.770> five-minute<00:02:47.220> mark<00:02:47.250> and<00:02:47.550> of<00:02:47.610> course

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
after the five-minute mark and of course

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:50.330 
after the five-minute mark and of course
warp<00:02:48.000> gate<00:02:48.180> tech<00:02:48.480> if<00:02:48.690> fully<00:02:49.560> chrono<00:02:49.920> boosted

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
warp gate tech if fully chrono boosted

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.820 
warp gate tech if fully chrono boosted
out<00:02:50.520> correctly<00:02:51.180> it<00:02:51.900> should<00:02:51.960> be<00:02:52.320> done<00:02:52.530> so<00:02:52.710> we

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
out correctly it should be done so we

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:54.590 
out correctly it should be done so we
see<00:02:53.010> that<00:02:53.160> this<00:02:53.250> is<00:02:53.430> a<00:02:53.460> little<00:02:53.760> bit<00:02:53.880> later<00:02:54.090> so

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
see that this is a little bit later so

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.720 
see that this is a little bit later so
we<00:02:54.750> so<00:02:55.080> some<00:02:55.650> people<00:02:55.920> delay<00:02:56.190> their<00:02:56.370> warp<00:02:56.550> gate

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
we so some people delay their warp gate

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.420 
we so some people delay their warp gate
tech<00:02:56.970> for<00:02:57.240> economy<00:02:57.720> and<00:02:57.900> so<00:02:58.410> that<00:02:59.070> would<00:02:59.280> be

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
tech for economy and so that would be

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.490 
tech for economy and so that would be
that<00:02:59.790> would<00:02:59.850> be<00:03:00.030> great<00:03:00.300> in<00:03:00.510> this<00:03:00.690> position<00:03:01.140> so

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
that would be great in this position so

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.320 
that would be great in this position so
we<00:03:01.530> see<00:03:01.740> a<00:03:01.770> Terran<00:03:02.730> players<00:03:02.940> getting<00:03:03.210> in

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 
we see a Terran players getting in

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:04.670 
we see a Terran players getting in
concussive<00:03:03.660> shells<00:03:03.900> already<00:03:04.290> doing<00:03:04.530> their

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
concussive shells already doing their

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.680 
concussive shells already doing their
work<00:03:04.800> doing<00:03:05.010> good<00:03:05.250> micro<00:03:05.820> on<00:03:06.030> his<00:03:06.180> Marines<00:03:06.510> and

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
work doing good micro on his Marines and

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:08.390 
work doing good micro on his Marines and
in<00:03:07.110> this<00:03:07.440> arm<00:03:07.650> is<00:03:07.800> going<00:03:07.860> to<00:03:07.980> be<00:03:08.040> easily

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
in this arm is going to be easily

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.070 
in this arm is going to be easily
cleaned<00:03:08.880> up<00:03:09.180> and<00:03:09.300> of<00:03:09.390> course<00:03:09.570> warp<00:03:09.750> gate<00:03:09.900> tech

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:10.080 
cleaned up and of course warp gate tech

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:11.960 
cleaned up and of course warp gate tech
is<00:03:10.230> only<00:03:10.410> three<00:03:10.710> fourths<00:03:10.920> done<00:03:11.190> so<00:03:11.700> he's<00:03:11.850> going

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
is only three fourths done so he's going

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:13.430 
is only three fourths done so he's going
to<00:03:12.030> be<00:03:12.150> able<00:03:12.240> to<00:03:12.390> easily<00:03:12.510> pop<00:03:12.840> off<00:03:13.020> this<00:03:13.140> pylon

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
to be able to easily pop off this pylon

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:14.930 
to be able to easily pop off this pylon
and<00:03:13.740> then<00:03:14.130> that's<00:03:14.250> going<00:03:14.370> to<00:03:14.490> force<00:03:14.700> the<00:03:14.820> work

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
and then that's going to force the work

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:16.820 
and then that's going to force the work
detective<00:03:15.420> never<00:03:15.690> be<00:03:15.900> finished<00:03:16.110> research<00:03:16.590> and

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:16.830 
detective never be finished research and

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:19.310 
detective never be finished research and
basically<00:03:17.310> the<00:03:17.520> game<00:03:17.700> is<00:03:17.880> over<00:03:18.450> already<00:03:18.630> kind

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:19.320 
basically the game is over already kind

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:21.770 
basically the game is over already kind
of<00:03:19.380> at<00:03:19.530> a<00:03:19.560> lower<00:03:19.890> level<00:03:20.010> of<00:03:20.340> play<00:03:20.610> a<00:03:20.880> lot<00:03:21.750> of

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
of at a lower level of play a lot of

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.030 
of at a lower level of play a lot of
people<00:03:21.900> don't<00:03:22.290> do<00:03:22.440> the<00:03:22.590> really<00:03:22.800> quick

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
people don't do the really quick

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.740 
people don't do the really quick
six-minute<00:03:23.670> warp<00:03:23.820> gate<00:03:24.000> tech<00:03:24.210> they<00:03:24.390> really

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
six-minute warp gate tech they really

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:26.570 
six-minute warp gate tech they really
delay<00:03:25.080> it<00:03:25.260> and<00:03:25.410> so<00:03:25.710> you're<00:03:25.890> going<00:03:25.980> to<00:03:26.040> see<00:03:26.280> he

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:26.580 
delay it and so you're going to see he

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:28.460 
delay it and so you're going to see he
you<00:03:27.210> know<00:03:27.690> kind<00:03:27.930> of<00:03:27.960> got<00:03:28.080> caught<00:03:28.260> off<00:03:28.440> guard

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
you know kind of got caught off guard

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:29.960 
you know kind of got caught off guard
he's<00:03:28.920> not<00:03:29.070> going<00:03:29.190> to<00:03:29.220> be<00:03:29.280> too<00:03:29.430> happy<00:03:29.610> about<00:03:29.790> it

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
he's not going to be too happy about it

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:32.780 
he's not going to be too happy about it
because<00:03:30.120> he<00:03:30.450> decided<00:03:30.780> to<00:03:31.050> get<00:03:31.410> economy<00:03:32.040> over

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
because he decided to get economy over

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:35.090 
because he decided to get economy over
his<00:03:33.210> fast<00:03:33.660> for<00:03:33.930> gate<00:03:34.110> and<00:03:34.260> what<00:03:34.680> I've<00:03:34.800> seen<00:03:35.040> and

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:35.100 
his fast for gate and what I've seen and

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:36.920 
his fast for gate and what I've seen and
a<00:03:35.340> lot<00:03:35.490> of<00:03:35.520> lowers<00:03:35.820> levels<00:03:36.150> of<00:03:36.300> play<00:03:36.540> is<00:03:36.780> that

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
a lot of lowers levels of play is that

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:38.600 
a lot of lowers levels of play is that
people<00:03:37.230> don't<00:03:37.380> go<00:03:37.590> for<00:03:37.860> the<00:03:37.890> six-minute<00:03:38.430> warp

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:38.610 
people don't go for the six-minute warp

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:41.570 
people don't go for the six-minute warp
gate<00:03:38.760> attack<00:03:39.060> so<00:03:39.630> in<00:03:39.870> this<00:03:40.260> case<00:03:40.560> this<00:03:40.980> will<00:03:41.340> be

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:41.580 
gate attack so in this case this will be

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:43.220 
gate attack so in this case this will be
effective<00:03:42.180> and<00:03:42.330> this<00:03:42.510> will<00:03:42.720> work<00:03:42.930> only

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
effective and this will work only

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:45.680 
effective and this will work only
someone<00:03:43.980> may<00:03:44.190> be<00:03:44.220> really<00:03:44.850> pushing<00:03:45.300> going

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:45.690 
someone may be really pushing going

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:49.970 
someone may be really pushing going

still do not think that would have

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:06.350 
still do not think that would have

of the tournament videos and of course
if<00:04:22.770> you<00:04:22.919> played<00:04:23.400> a<00:04:23.430> game<00:04:23.700> that<00:04:23.880> you<00:04:24.000> thought

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:24.210 
if you played a game that you thought

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:25.129 
if you played a game that you thought
was<00:04:24.360> just<00:04:24.600> completely

00:04:25.129 --> 00:04:25.139 
was just completely

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:29.119 
was just completely
epic<00:04:25.469> and<00:04:25.710> amazing<00:04:27.139> send<00:04:28.139> it<00:04:28.229> in<00:04:28.349> to<00:04:28.379> me<00:04:28.469> send

00:04:29.119 --> 00:04:29.129 
epic and amazing send it in to me send

00:04:29.129 --> 00:04:30.860 
epic and amazing send it in to me send
it<00:04:29.219> in<00:04:29.340> to<00:04:29.370> me<00:04:29.460> because<00:04:29.939> I<00:04:30.090> know<00:04:30.270> I<00:04:30.419> wasn't<00:04:30.689> able

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:30.870 
it in to me because I know I wasn't able

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:32.540 
it in to me because I know I wasn't able
to<00:04:31.080> watch<00:04:31.259> nearly<00:04:31.830> all<00:04:32.009> the<00:04:32.189> matches<00:04:32.520> that

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:32.550 
to watch nearly all the matches that

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:35.420 
to watch nearly all the matches that
took<00:04:32.819> place<00:04:32.999> so<00:04:33.749> I<00:04:33.779> email<00:04:34.620> those<00:04:34.800> to<00:04:34.830> me<00:04:35.189> if<00:04:35.340> you

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:35.430 
took place so I email those to me if you

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:36.980 
took place so I email those to me if you
thought<00:04:35.610> it<00:04:35.759> was<00:04:35.849> really<00:04:36.090> awesome<00:04:36.240> so<00:04:36.749> I<00:04:36.810> can

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:36.990 
thought it was really awesome so I can

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:38.570 
thought it was really awesome so I can
take<00:04:37.139> a<00:04:37.199> look<00:04:37.409> and<00:04:37.560> possibly<00:04:37.710> cast<00:04:38.249> it<00:04:38.430> but<00:04:38.550> I

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:38.580 
take a look and possibly cast it but I

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:39.679 
take a look and possibly cast it but I
hope<00:04:38.729> you<00:04:38.849> guys<00:04:38.999> have<00:04:39.150> enjoyed<00:04:39.210> this<00:04:39.509> game
