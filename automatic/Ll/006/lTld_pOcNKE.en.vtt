and<00:01:10.860> so<00:01:11.340> as<00:01:11.580> a<00:01:11.610> chef<00:01:12.000> and<00:01:12.299> a<00:01:12.390> person<00:01:12.900> I<00:01:13.080> have

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
and so as a chef and a person I have

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.749 
and so as a chef and a person I have
grown<00:01:13.979> and<00:01:14.430> I<00:01:15.380> have<00:01:16.380> different<00:01:16.740> ideas<00:01:17.009> now<00:01:17.369> and

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
grown and I have different ideas now and

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:22.640 
grown and I have different ideas now and
so<00:01:18.630> I<00:01:20.240> although<00:01:21.240> nothing<00:01:21.659> that<00:01:21.930> I<00:01:21.960> said<00:01:22.409> or<00:01:22.619> did

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
so I although nothing that I said or did

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.270 
so I although nothing that I said or did
was<00:01:22.950> wrong<00:01:23.400> I<00:01:23.880> may<00:01:24.330> have<00:01:24.450> done<00:01:24.600> it<00:01:24.750> differently

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:25.280 
was wrong I may have done it differently

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.969 
was wrong I may have done it differently
now<00:01:26.280> so<00:01:27.140> definitely<00:01:28.140> I<00:01:28.380> think<00:01:28.409> if<00:01:28.770> you're

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
now so definitely I think if you're

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.440 
now so definitely I think if you're
given<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.310> opportunity<00:01:29.549> to<00:01:30.030> look<00:01:30.180> back<00:01:30.240> on

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450
