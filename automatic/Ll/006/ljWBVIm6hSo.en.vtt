00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
didn't count them but as you you get a

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.080 
didn't count them but as you you get a
general<00:02:01.560> idea<00:02:01.830> that<00:02:02.130> there's<00:02:02.520> quite<00:02:02.790> a<00:02:02.820> few<00:02:02.880> of

general idea that there's quite a few of

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.480 
general idea that there's quite a few of
them<00:02:03.300> here<00:02:05.030> and<00:02:06.030> it's<00:02:06.180> just<00:02:06.390> something<00:02:06.720> fun<00:02:06.990> to
