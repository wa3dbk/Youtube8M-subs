00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 against Finland the summary of the 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:07.830
 match of the first one that had xavi 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:10.050
 hernandez another pulls up joaquin and 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.240
 france that had five minutes very 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.530
 good but then Spain is the one that 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.170
 makes control of the party with the 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.359
 possession with the goal plays with the 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.189
 bring the ball very clearly from 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.560
 side by side I think the result is just 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:25.220
 and the victory of Spain very important 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.830
 doing a visit and they put them 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:31.189
 we are seeing this move where 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:33.440
 Peter seemed to be knocked down the referee 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:36.680
 does not mark the lack there is thrown before 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:38.449
 Peter if he keeps the balance and 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.489
 look for the ball surely cry what 

00:00:38.449 --> 00:00:42.980
 run over and then if you could mark 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:43.790
 the lack but home he considered not 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:45.769
 there was a pledge 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:47.690
 first milestone this hand in hand in the part 

00:00:45.769 --> 00:00:50.839
 end of the first half very well valdés 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:53.059
 a girl although doubt in the exit ends 

00:00:50.839 --> 00:00:55.519
 covering the attempt of ribery that was 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:57.350
 nothing to put between the legs the 

00:00:55.519 --> 00:00:59.570
 ball and spain in the second half 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:02.689
 started with this shot over 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:04.280
 Andres Inista and Spain- who found 

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:06.020
 and to greater depth especially with 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:09.380
 iniesta that gives you great clarity google 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:11.299
 Spanish and French especially with 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.340
 plays of this kind sought to be 

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:14.840
 dangerous and the few that generated the 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.549
 it ended up containing quite well 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.440
 valdés when here we saw the tremendous 

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:20.550
 header 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:23.550
 karim benzema did not like it 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:26.190
 the number of this the goal play a 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:29.190
 trace of pedro for nacho monreal that 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:32.220
 lowers the ball observes how pica pedro 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:34.710
 again there he puts the ball and for more 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.900
 that hugo llorís did not avoid the 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.670
 annotation that meant the three points 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.250
 for Spain the carambola and after the 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.980
 Pedro's auction had the yaris that deals 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:46.350
 to cover simply as it says raúl no 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:48.240
 can and could liquidate Busquets 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.980
 this play when urinating comes out very well 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:54.180
 Touch was a little long and you're looking 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:56.730
 He looked for company through the center and could not 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.740
 nail the second france pressed to 

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:01.680
 despite staying with ten men for 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:05.120
 the stern ejection pressed but did not 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.120
 reached for the match 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.840
 let's review the play of the goal 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.430
 Spain first as Pedro opens the ball 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.440
 with a lot of intention since it does not measure well 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.330
 but around him is a great control and 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.790
 the sting that makes Peter of pain of 20 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:19.680
 meters to get to the goal with 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.540
 clarity ends we find the 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.160
 ball on the course but not what 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:26.040
 enough to get her out of her goal 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.540
 This is how the goal of Spain was played 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.980
 difficult for the French goalkeeper 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.769
 react to him for the short space 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.420
 between Pedro and him and Spain 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:35.370
 a good play ends the same 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:38.580
 Pedro has started an extraordinary 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:42.600
 played there we see again the stroke the 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:44.970
 control oriented perfect the center and 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:47.640
 how it came with that force with the 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:51.540
 speed that Pedro brought 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:53.730
 finish that you cried and could not get three 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:57.269
 points and so is the group with Spain 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:59.730
 already up to the head with 11 units 10 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:02.400
 of France Georgia Belarus and 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.930
 It seems to me that Finland will have nothing 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.790
 what to do in this group we saw the 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:08.610
 calendar Spain and France will return to 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:13.310
 play eliminator until September three 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:13.310
 matches to each Spain two at home
