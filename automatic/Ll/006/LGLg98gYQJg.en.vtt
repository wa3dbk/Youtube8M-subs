strand braid on this if you don't know
how<00:01:14.240> to<00:01:14.270> do<00:01:14.569> a<00:01:14.600> simple<00:01:14.929> three<00:01:15.229> strand<00:01:15.560> braid

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:15.619 
how to do a simple three strand braid

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:19.840 
how to do a simple three strand braid
you<00:01:16.460> want<00:01:16.670> to<00:01:16.789> cross<00:01:17.530> outside<00:01:18.530> strands<00:01:19.429> into

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:19.850 
you want to cross outside strands into

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.960 
you want to cross outside strands into
the<00:01:20.780> middle<00:01:21.200> and<00:01:21.590> they<00:01:21.770> take<00:01:22.009> turns<00:01:22.250> this

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:22.970 
the middle and they take turns this

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:25.630 
the middle and they take turns this
outside<00:01:23.539> strand<00:01:23.899> goes<00:01:24.080> in<00:01:24.319> the<00:01:24.409> middle<00:01:24.770> this

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:25.640 
outside strand goes in the middle this

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.540 
outside strand goes in the middle this
outside<00:01:26.210> strand<00:01:26.600> goes<00:01:26.780> in<00:01:27.050> the<00:01:27.140> middle<00:01:27.550> so

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:28.550 
outside strand goes in the middle so

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:31.419 
outside strand goes in the middle so
each<00:01:29.090> strand<00:01:29.720> gets<00:01:30.380> to<00:01:30.679> be<00:01:30.920> in<00:01:31.069> the<00:01:31.220> middle

00:01:31.419 --> 00:01:31.429 
each strand gets to be in the middle

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:36.370 
each strand gets to be in the middle
they<00:01:32.060> alternate<00:01:32.659> they<00:01:33.049> take<00:01:33.289> tarts<00:01:35.110> there<00:01:36.110> are

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
they alternate they take tarts there are

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.859 
they alternate they take tarts there are
