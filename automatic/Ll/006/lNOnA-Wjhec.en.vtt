you<00:02:45.010> definitely<00:02:45.220> don't<00:02:45.520> think<00:02:45.640> of<00:02:46.060> high

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
you definitely don't think of high

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:48.479 
you definitely don't think of high
caliber<00:02:47.050> of<00:02:47.080> play<00:02:47.410> you<00:02:47.620> think<00:02:47.830> of<00:02:47.950> underdogs

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:48.489 
caliber of play you think of underdogs

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 
the old-school underdogs to come in and

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:53.699 
the old-school underdogs to come in and
when<00:02:52.239> occasionally<00:02:52.810> and<00:02:53.110> when<00:02:53.230> they<00:02:53.350> do<00:02:53.410> win

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:53.709 
when occasionally and when they do win

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:55.979 
when occasionally and when they do win
it's<00:02:53.950> a<00:02:54.040> big<00:02:54.280> big<00:02:54.580> deal<00:02:54.850> looking<00:02:55.510> at<00:02:55.660> yellow

00:02:55.979 --> 00:02:55.989 
it's a big big deal looking at yellow

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:58.170

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
versus be sooo on Heartbreak Ridge that

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:01.470 
versus be sooo on Heartbreak Ridge that
was<00:02:58.480> a<00:02:58.510> big<00:02:58.930> big<00:02:59.350> deal<00:02:59.680> because<00:03:00.340> a<00:03:00.550> yellow<00:03:01.269> had

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:03.160 
not won a game at about two years I

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.280 
not won a game at about two years I
believe<00:03:03.459> maybe<00:03:04.269> even<00:03:04.480> longer<00:03:04.630> than<00:03:04.780> that<00:03:04.930> but

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.290 
believe maybe even longer than that but

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:09.120 
believe maybe even longer than that but
yes<00:03:06.630> ruby<00:03:07.630> is<00:03:07.660> he<00:03:08.260> doesn't<00:03:08.440> really<00:03:08.650> fit<00:03:08.950> that

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:09.130 
yes ruby is he doesn't really fit that

yes ruby is he doesn't really fit that
Air<00:03:09.310> Force<00:03:09.340> mold<00:03:09.970> he<00:03:10.810> is<00:03:10.900> definitely<00:03:11.170> the

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530 
Air Force mold he is definitely the

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:13.140 
Air Force mold he is definitely the
heart<00:03:11.799> of<00:03:11.980> Air<00:03:12.130> Force<00:03:12.160> days<00:03:12.610> now<00:03:12.850> and<00:03:12.880> maybe

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
heart of Air Force days now and maybe

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:14.729 
heart of Air Force days now and maybe
that's<00:03:13.420> why<00:03:13.569> he's<00:03:13.690> been<00:03:13.840> playing<00:03:14.080> so<00:03:14.350> good<00:03:14.560> I

the<00:03:30.310> pro<00:03:30.459> league<00:03:30.610> final<00:03:30.940> so<00:03:31.030> I<00:03:31.090> guess<00:03:31.239> that's<00:03:31.420> a

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:31.510 
the pro league final so I guess that's a

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:35.280 
the pro league final so I guess that's a
poor<00:03:31.750> example<00:03:31.840> but<00:03:32.350> you<00:03:32.769> know<00:03:32.980> what<00:03:33.130> I<00:03:33.160> mean<00:03:34.290> Ok

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290 
poor example but you know what I mean Ok

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:37.350 
poor example but you know what I mean Ok
