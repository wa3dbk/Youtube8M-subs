passed<00:00:56.129> through<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:56.520> filter<00:00:56.879> it<00:00:57.329> gets

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
passed through the filter it gets

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.020 
passed through the filter it gets
trapped<00:00:57.809> in<00:00:58.020> the<00:00:58.050> filter<00:00:58.320> walls<00:00:58.710> now<00:00:59.460> every<00:00:59.699> 20

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
trapped in the filter walls now every 20

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.700 
trapped in the filter walls now every 20
or<00:01:00.059> so<00:01:00.329> hours<00:01:00.539> this<00:01:00.930> filter<00:01:01.260> will<00:01:01.320> need<00:01:01.500> to<00:01:01.590> be

or so hours this filter will need to be

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:07.640 
or so hours this filter will need to be
regenerated<00:01:02.989> Crees<00:01:04.309> combustion<00:01:05.960> so<00:01:06.960> you're

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
the tractor you can park the tractor up

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.280 
the tractor you can park the tractor up
hit<00:01:47.790> that<00:01:47.970> button<00:01:48.210> and<00:01:48.420> the<00:01:48.689> tractor<00:01:48.930> will<00:01:49.140> do

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
hit that button and the tractor will do

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.120 
hit that button and the tractor will do
the<00:01:49.409> rest<00:01:49.640> now<00:01:50.640> filter<00:01:50.939> lasts<00:01:51.479> between<00:01:52.130> 3,000

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
the rest now filter lasts between 3,000

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.859 
the rest now filter lasts between 3,000
to<00:01:53.220> 5,000<00:01:53.850> hours<00:01:54.000> before<00:01:54.479> it<00:01:54.570> needs<00:01:54.630> to<00:01:54.780> be

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
to 5,000 hours before it needs to be

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.440 
to 5,000 hours before it needs to be
taken<00:01:55.200> out<00:01:55.320> and<00:01:55.380> cleaned<00:01:55.770> but<00:01:56.610> kta<00:01:57.119> spare

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
taken out and cleaned but kta spare

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.480 
taken out and cleaned but kta spare
parts<00:01:57.810> will<00:01:58.020> have<00:01:58.049> new<00:01:58.350> filters<00:01:58.799> available<00:01:58.920> at

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
parts will have new filters available at

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.929 
parts will have new filters available at
a<00:01:59.579> reduced<00:01:59.880> rate<00:02:00.350> so<00:02:01.350> in<00:02:01.590> conclusion<00:02:02.130> these

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
a reduced rate so in conclusion these

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:04.310 
a reduced rate so in conclusion these
engines<00:02:03.390> are<00:02:03.540> the<00:02:03.630> cleanest<00:02:04.020> occur<00:02:04.200> boat

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
engines are the cleanest occur boat

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.940 
engines are the cleanest occur boat
engines<00:02:04.969> available<00:02:06.320> and<00:02:07.320> they<00:02:07.619> meet<00:02:07.829> this

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
engines available and they meet this

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:08.900 
engines available and they meet this
requirement<00:02:08.160> with

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
requirement with

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:21.050 
requirement with
costly<00:02:09.480> AdBlue<00:02:09.990> systems<00:02:18.740> okay<00:02:19.740> we'll<00:02:20.730> go<00:02:20.850> back

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
costly AdBlue systems okay we'll go back

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.930 
costly AdBlue systems okay we'll go back
I'll<00:02:21.810> press<00:02:22.080> the<00:02:22.230> button<00:02:22.260> over<00:02:22.770> here<00:02:22.850> so<00:02:23.850> okay

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
I'll press the button over here so okay

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.600 
I'll press the button over here so okay
so<00:02:24.410> basically<00:02:25.410> you<00:02:25.590> hit<00:02:25.740> the<00:02:25.860> auto<00:02:26.040> regen

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
so basically you hit the auto regen

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.610 
so basically you hit the auto regen
button<00:02:26.910> you<00:02:27.150> can<00:02:27.300> continue<00:02:28.170> using<00:02:28.380> the

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
button you can continue using the

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:32.750 
button you can continue using the
tractor<00:02:28.980> as<00:02:29.190> per<00:02:29.760> normal<00:02:29.940> and<00:02:31.340> the<00:02:32.340> only<00:02:32.460> time

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
tractor as per normal and the only time

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:33.950 
tractor as per normal and the only time
you<00:02:32.850> will<00:02:32.940> need<00:02:33.000> to<00:02:33.090> do<00:02:33.240> anything<00:02:33.570> is<00:02:33.690> when<00:02:33.870> the

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:33.960 
you will need to do anything is when the

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:36.920 
you will need to do anything is when the
increase<00:02:34.260> rpm<00:02:34.800> light<00:02:35.010> comes<00:02:35.250> on<00:02:35.430> so<00:02:36.060> basically

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
increase rpm light comes on so basically

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:38.930 
increase rpm light comes on so basically
you<00:02:37.140> increase<00:02:37.500> your<00:02:37.650> rpm<00:02:38.070> the<00:02:38.370> exhaust<00:02:38.700> gets

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
you increase your rpm the exhaust gets

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.030 
you increase your rpm the exhaust gets
hotter<00:02:39.120> and<00:02:39.390> the<00:02:40.170> tractor<00:02:40.440> will<00:02:40.620> do<00:02:40.770> the<00:02:40.890> rest

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
hotter and the tractor will do the rest

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.420 
hotter and the tractor will do the rest
now<00:02:41.910> the<00:02:42.360> parts<00:02:42.690> region<00:02:43.140> is<00:02:43.860> another<00:02:44.220> feature

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
now the parts region is another feature

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:45.980 
now the parts region is another feature
so<00:02:44.910> if<00:02:45.030> you<00:02:45.120> don't<00:02:45.300> want<00:02:45.450> to<00:02:45.510> continue<00:02:45.870> using

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:45.990 
so if you don't want to continue using

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:47.630 
so if you don't want to continue using
the<00:02:46.230> tractor<00:02:46.530> you<00:02:46.620> can<00:02:46.800> park<00:02:47.100> the<00:02:47.250> tractor<00:02:47.610> up

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
the tractor you can park the tractor up

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.150 
the tractor you can park the tractor up
hit<00:02:48.450> the<00:02:48.600> park<00:02:48.810> to<00:02:48.900> regen<00:02:49.200> button<00:02:49.500> and<00:02:49.680> the

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
hit the park to regen button and the

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:55.870 
hit the park to regen button and the
tractor<00:02:50.490> will<00:02:50.610> do<00:02:50.730> the<00:02:50.880> rest

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:55.880 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:00.350 

it<00:02:56.880> takes<00:02:57.360> between<00:02:57.510> 20<00:02:58.230> and<00:02:58.260> 40<00:02:58.830> minutes<00:02:59.180> to<00:03:00.180> do

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
it takes between 20 and 40 minutes to do

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.090 
it takes between 20 and 40 minutes to do
the<00:03:00.540> regeneration<00:03:01.350> that's<00:03:01.620> in<00:03:01.710> the<00:03:01.800> park<00:03:01.980> to

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 
the regeneration that's in the park to

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:03.590 
the regeneration that's in the park to
regeneration<00:03:02.490> but<00:03:02.760> if<00:03:02.850> you're<00:03:02.970> in<00:03:03.210> the<00:03:03.330> order

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:03.600 
regeneration but if you're in the order

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.960 
regeneration but if you're in the order
or<00:03:03.690> in<00:03:03.930> ocean<00:03:04.260> you<00:03:05.070> continue<00:03:05.580> using<00:03:05.760> the

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
or in ocean you continue using the

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:07.580 
or in ocean you continue using the
tractor<00:03:06.360> and<00:03:06.540> you<00:03:06.960> won't<00:03:07.110> even<00:03:07.230> notice<00:03:07.440> that

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
tractor and you won't even notice that

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:17.180 
tractor and you won't even notice that
it's<00:03:07.830> happening<00:03:14.630> yeah<00:03:15.630> so<00:03:15.900> the<00:03:16.110> what<00:03:16.860> happens

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
it's happening yeah so the what happens

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:19.640 
it's happening yeah so the what happens
is<00:03:17.480> with<00:03:18.480> the<00:03:18.570> regeneration<00:03:18.870> the<00:03:19.290> suit<00:03:19.470> gets

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
is with the regeneration the suit gets

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:23.080 
is with the regeneration the suit gets
trapped<00:03:19.890> in<00:03:20.040> the<00:03:20.130> walls<00:03:20.340> of<00:03:20.580> the<00:03:20.880> filter<00:03:21.890> and

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
trapped in the walls of the filter and

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:27.380 
trapped in the walls of the filter and
the<00:03:25.040> the<00:03:26.040> sort<00:03:26.310> inside<00:03:26.760> that<00:03:26.940> filter<00:03:27.240> gets

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390 
the the sort inside that filter gets

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:32.090 
the the sort inside that filter gets
burnt<00:03:27.630> off<00:03:27.870> basically<00:03:30.380> yeah<00:03:31.380> we<00:03:31.560> do<00:03:31.860> have<00:03:31.890> a

experience it's in the cap so we've got

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:48.530 
experience it's in the cap so we've got
two<00:03:45.480> bays<00:03:46.320> or<00:03:46.680> pits<00:03:46.920> prepared<00:03:47.550> one<00:03:48.270> with<00:03:48.450> the

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
two bays or pits prepared one with the

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:49.670 
two bays or pits prepared one with the
hydraulic<00:03:48.930> tool<00:03:49.110> that<00:03:49.260> are<00:03:49.350> going<00:03:49.440> to<00:03:49.500> show

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
hydraulic tool that are going to show

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.350 
hydraulic tool that are going to show
you<00:03:49.740> to<00:03:50.340> play<00:03:50.520> around<00:03:50.700> with<00:03:50.850> the<00:03:50.970> hydraulics

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:51.360 
you to play around with the hydraulics

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:52.580 
you to play around with the hydraulics
get<00:03:51.480> familiar<00:03:51.780> with<00:03:51.930> that<00:03:52.080> and<00:03:52.200> the<00:03:52.260> second

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
get familiar with that and the second

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:54.950 
get familiar with that and the second
one<00:03:52.680> is<00:03:52.770> the<00:03:52.860> DPF<00:03:53.310> which<00:03:54.030> you<00:03:54.180> can<00:03:54.360> we<00:03:54.720> can't

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:54.960 
one is the DPF which you can we can't

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:56.480 
one is the DPF which you can we can't
run<00:03:55.200> the<00:03:55.320> DPF<00:03:55.650> because<00:03:55.890> the<00:03:55.980> tractors<00:03:56.280> are<00:03:56.370> not

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:56.490 
run the DPF because the tractors are not

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:58.310 
run the DPF because the tractors are not
dirty<00:03:56.730> enough<00:03:57.090> in<00:03:57.300> regards<00:03:57.660> to<00:03:57.690> the<00:03:57.810> filter<00:03:58.140> is

00:03:58.310 --> 00:03:58.320 
dirty enough in regards to the filter is

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:00.410 
dirty enough in regards to the filter is
not<00:03:58.380> clogged<00:03:58.800> but<00:03:59.520> you<00:03:59.640> can<00:03:59.850> you<00:04:00.330> know

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:00.420 
not clogged but you can you know

experience<00:04:00.840> with<00:04:00.960> Chris<00:04:01.200> how<00:04:02.010> you<00:04:02.040> operate

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:02.460 
experience with Chris how you operate

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:03.980 
experience with Chris how you operate
the<00:04:02.580> system<00:04:02.940> what<00:04:03.090> do<00:04:03.180> you<00:04:03.240> have<00:04:03.360> to<00:04:03.480> do<00:04:03.600> bla

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:03.990 
the system what do you have to do bla

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:06.590 
the system what do you have to do bla
bla<00:04:04.230> so<00:04:04.440> what<00:04:05.250> happens<00:04:05.520> is<00:04:05.670> what<00:04:06.060> happens<00:04:06.360> what

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:06.600 
bla so what happens is what happens what

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:07.970 
bla so what happens is what happens what
happens<00:04:06.630> actually<00:04:07.110> inside<00:04:07.290> is<00:04:07.500> how<00:04:07.740> does<00:04:07.890> it

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:07.980 
happens actually inside is how does it

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:10.910 
happens actually inside is how does it
clean<00:04:08.160> it<00:04:08.310> it<00:04:08.490> injects<00:04:08.910> fuel<00:04:09.270> to<00:04:09.960> clean<00:04:10.710> that

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:10.920 
clean it it injects fuel to clean that

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:12.380 
clean it it injects fuel to clean that
that<00:04:11.220> filter<00:04:11.580> off<00:04:11.670> I<00:04:11.790> think<00:04:11.850> that's<00:04:12.150> what<00:04:12.270> that

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:12.390 
that filter off I think that's what that

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:14.480 
that filter off I think that's what that
was<00:04:12.510> the<00:04:12.630> thing<00:04:12.900> that<00:04:13.020> was<00:04:13.140> sort<00:04:13.380> of<00:04:13.490> still

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:14.490 
was the thing that was sort of still

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:16.700 
was the thing that was sort of still
that's<00:04:14.580> an<00:04:14.820> outstanding<00:04:15.180> -<00:04:15.720> to<00:04:16.290> make<00:04:16.680> a
