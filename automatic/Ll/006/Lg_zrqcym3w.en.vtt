that<00:02:01.759> seal<00:02:02.030> didn't<00:02:02.630> really<00:02:02.869> feel<00:02:03.049> like<00:02:03.109> these

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:03.439 
that seal didn't really feel like these

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:06.039 
that seal didn't really feel like these
had<00:02:03.740> the<00:02:04.009> the<00:02:04.789> strength<00:02:05.210> to<00:02:05.359> do<00:02:05.570> that<00:02:05.600> so<00:02:06.020> I

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:06.049 
had the the strength to do that so I

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:08.410 
had the the strength to do that so I
never<00:02:06.500> got<00:02:06.679> a<00:02:06.740> complete<00:02:07.310> seal<00:02:07.579> so<00:02:07.789> obviously

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420 
never got a complete seal so obviously

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:11.080 
never got a complete seal so obviously
