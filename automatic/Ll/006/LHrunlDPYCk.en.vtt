are their ankles so much to to get to
this<00:01:38.520> point<00:01:38.759> but<00:01:39.060> in<00:01:39.210> reality<00:01:39.420> it's<00:01:39.900> more<00:01:40.140> of

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
this point but in reality it's more of

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.140 
this point but in reality it's more of
your<00:01:40.439> knees<00:01:40.680> so<00:01:41.460> you're<00:01:41.670> just<00:01:41.729> going<00:01:41.880> to<00:01:41.970> want

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
your knees so you're just going to want

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.510 
your knees so you're just going to want
to<00:01:42.270> bend<00:01:42.479> your<00:01:42.540> knees<00:01:42.810> and<00:01:43.049> kind<00:01:43.680> of<00:01:43.799> let<00:01:44.399> your

to bend your knees and kind of let your

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.210 
to bend your knees and kind of let your
legs<00:01:44.880> fall<00:01:45.030> over<00:01:45.689> to<00:01:45.780> the<00:01:45.899> side<00:01:46.170> and<00:01:46.920> when<00:01:47.130> you

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
legs fall over to the side and when you

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:48.710 
legs fall over to the side and when you
let<00:01:47.369> them<00:01:47.460> fall<00:01:47.670> over<00:01:47.880> to<00:01:47.939> the<00:01:48.030> side<00:01:48.240> enough<00:01:48.540> on

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
let them fall over to the side enough on

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.389 
let them fall over to the side enough on
flat<00:01:48.990> ground<00:01:49.259> you'll<00:01:49.439> fill<00:01:49.680> your<00:01:49.890> boot<00:01:50.130> touch

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
flat ground you'll fill your boot touch

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.160 
flat ground you'll fill your boot touch
and<00:01:50.670> it<00:01:51.090> almost<00:01:51.270> gives<00:01:51.689> you<00:01:51.780> some<00:01:51.990> more

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
and it almost gives you some more

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.630 
and it almost gives you some more
stability<00:01:52.560> and<00:01:52.799> that's<00:01:53.130> what<00:01:53.340> you<00:01:53.430> should<00:01:53.460> be

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
stability and that's what you should be

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.490 
stability and that's what you should be
filling<00:01:54.119> so<00:01:54.720> when<00:01:54.869> you<00:01:54.960> fill<00:01:55.140> that<00:01:55.320> more

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
filling so when you fill that more

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.609 
filling so when you fill that more
stability<00:01:55.860> you<00:01:56.460> want<00:01:56.640> to<00:01:56.729> Center<00:01:57.030> your<00:01:57.210> body

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
this is one of those tricks that doesn't

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.530 
this is one of those tricks that doesn't
really<00:02:22.950> make<00:02:23.160> sense<00:02:23.190> stepping<00:02:23.970> on<00:02:24.120> to<00:02:24.360> on

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
really make sense stepping on to on

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.440 
really make sense stepping on to on
anything<00:02:24.810> because<00:02:25.489> it<00:02:26.489> is<00:02:26.550> a<00:02:26.700> fast<00:02:27.090> part<00:02:27.360> of

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
anything because it is a fast part of

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.180 
anything because it is a fast part of
your<00:02:27.569> skate<00:02:27.840> and<00:02:28.019> if<00:02:28.140> you<00:02:28.230> step<00:02:28.470> on<00:02:28.709> just<00:02:29.040> one

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
your skate and if you step on just one

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.699 
your skate and if you step on just one
foot<00:02:29.400> at<00:02:29.489> a<00:02:29.519> time<00:02:29.790> you<00:02:30.000> definitely<00:02:30.450> have<00:02:30.709> you

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
foot at a time you definitely have you

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:33.710 
foot at a time you definitely have you
definitely<00:02:31.739> may<00:02:32.250> slip<00:02:32.580> so<00:02:32.910> the<00:02:33.299> best<00:02:33.450> thing<00:02:33.690> to

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
definitely may slip so the best thing to

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.539 
definitely may slip so the best thing to
do<00:02:33.900> I<00:02:33.930> think<00:02:34.110> is<00:02:34.500> find<00:02:34.799> something<00:02:35.129> in<00:02:35.400> the

00:02:35.539 --> 00:02:35.549 
do I think is find something in the

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:37.039 
do I think is find something in the
ground<00:02:35.819> where<00:02:36.090> you<00:02:36.120> can<00:02:36.209> pretend<00:02:36.510> that<00:02:36.840> there

00:02:37.039 --> 00:02:37.049 
ground where you can pretend that there

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:37.970 
ground where you can pretend that there
is<00:02:37.140> something<00:02:37.379> that<00:02:37.530> you're<00:02:37.709> going<00:02:37.799> to<00:02:37.890> be

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
is something that you're going to be

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.309 
is something that you're going to be
grinding<00:02:38.459> so<00:02:39.150> even<00:02:39.569> if<00:02:39.660> there's<00:02:39.840> something<00:02:40.200> as

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:40.319 
grinding so even if there's something as

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:42.140 
grinding so even if there's something as
small<00:02:40.410> as<00:02:40.590> a<00:02:40.830> line<00:02:41.069> like<00:02:41.549> this<00:02:41.730> line<00:02:41.970> right

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
small as a line like this line right

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.110 
small as a line like this line right
here<00:02:42.330> in<00:02:42.420> the<00:02:42.480> wood<00:02:42.690> I<00:02:42.930> can<00:02:43.590> kind<00:02:43.769> of<00:02:43.830> pretend

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
here in the wood I can kind of pretend

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.160 
here in the wood I can kind of pretend
how<00:02:45.120> I<00:02:45.150> would<00:02:45.450> jump<00:02:45.660> on<00:02:45.870> it

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
how I would jump on it

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.500 
how I would jump on it
and<00:02:46.500> when<00:02:46.680> I<00:02:46.709> jump<00:02:47.069> on<00:02:47.250> it<00:02:47.430> I'm<00:02:48.030> going<00:02:48.239> to<00:02:48.329> want

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
and when I jump on it I'm going to want

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.240 
and when I jump on it I'm going to want
the<00:02:48.780> I'm<00:02:48.989> going<00:02:49.140> to<00:02:49.200> want<00:02:49.410> the<00:02:49.560> line<00:02:49.860> to<00:02:49.890> land

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
the I'm going to want the line to land

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.250 
the I'm going to want the line to land
in<00:02:50.430> the<00:02:50.549> middle<00:02:50.730> of<00:02:50.940> my<00:02:51.060> frame<00:02:51.329> and<00:02:51.630> I'm<00:02:52.110> going

in the middle of my frame and I'm going

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.080 
in the middle of my frame and I'm going

while<00:03:07.799> your<00:03:07.920> heads<00:03:08.099> facing<00:03:08.310> that<00:03:08.640> way<00:03:08.819> so<00:03:09.239> I'm

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:09.329 
while your heads facing that way so I'm

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:10.850 
while your heads facing that way so I'm
going<00:03:09.450> to<00:03:09.480> show<00:03:09.629> you<00:03:09.690> how<00:03:09.870> we<00:03:09.930> look<00:03:10.170> again<00:03:10.440> if

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
going to show you how we look again if

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:11.839 
going to show you how we look again if
you<00:03:11.010> were<00:03:11.099> just<00:03:11.220> to<00:03:11.310> do<00:03:11.459> it<00:03:11.549> on<00:03:11.610> something

00:03:11.839 --> 00:03:11.849 
you were just to do it on something

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:14.470 
you were just to do it on something
simple<00:03:12.299> like<00:03:12.390> the<00:03:12.569> line<00:03:12.750> so<00:03:13.650> be<00:03:13.799> the<00:03:13.890> jump<00:03:14.160> and

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 
simple like the line so be the jump and

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:17.840 
simple like the line so be the jump and
look<00:03:15.480> and<00:03:15.780> as<00:03:16.739> you<00:03:16.860> can<00:03:16.980> see<00:03:17.129> I<00:03:17.160> have<00:03:17.430> my<00:03:17.519> arms

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:17.850 
look and as you can see I have my arms

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:19.550 
look and as you can see I have my arms
out<00:03:17.970> here<00:03:18.209> too<00:03:18.389> and<00:03:18.540> it's<00:03:18.660> just<00:03:18.840> for<00:03:18.989> balance<00:03:19.380> a

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
out here too and it's just for balance a

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.680 
out here too and it's just for balance a
lot<00:03:19.709> of<00:03:19.799> times<00:03:19.980> you'll<00:03:20.160> see<00:03:20.190> acrobats<00:03:20.880> holding

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
lot of times you'll see acrobats holding

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:23.539 
lot of times you'll see acrobats holding
their<00:03:21.810> arms<00:03:22.170> out<00:03:22.260> like<00:03:22.440> that<00:03:22.680> and<00:03:22.859> it's<00:03:23.370> not

00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:23.549 
their arms out like that and it's not

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:26.390 
their arms out like that and it's not
for<00:03:23.880> it's<00:03:24.780> not<00:03:24.959> for<00:03:25.200> show<00:03:25.410> it's<00:03:25.799> definitely<00:03:26.310> to

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
for it's not for show it's definitely to

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:27.860 
for it's not for show it's definitely to
help<00:03:26.579> your<00:03:26.760> balance<00:03:26.910> out<00:03:27.209> so<00:03:27.389> when<00:03:27.540> you<00:03:27.600> land

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
help your balance out so when you land

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:29.720 
help your balance out so when you land
you<00:03:28.139> don't<00:03:28.470> necessarily<00:03:29.069> have<00:03:29.220> to<00:03:29.250> have<00:03:29.519> them

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
you don't necessarily have to have them

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:31.640 
you don't necessarily have to have them
out<00:03:29.819> like<00:03:30.060> this<00:03:30.329> but<00:03:30.959> you<00:03:31.109> want<00:03:31.290> to<00:03:31.380> have<00:03:31.530> them

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
out like this but you want to have them

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:33.349 
out like this but you want to have them
in<00:03:31.799> a<00:03:31.889> position<00:03:31.920> that<00:03:32.340> feels<00:03:32.609> good<00:03:32.940> and<00:03:33.000> feels

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:33.359 
in a position that feels good and feels

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:36.069 
in a position that feels good and feels
natural<00:03:33.739> so<00:03:34.739> when<00:03:34.889> you're<00:03:35.010> doing<00:03:35.130> your<00:03:35.310> Royale

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:36.079 
natural so when you're doing your Royale

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:38.360 
natural so when you're doing your Royale
once<00:03:37.079> you<00:03:37.200> take<00:03:37.410> enough<00:03:37.650> speed<00:03:37.920> into<00:03:38.220> it

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
once you take enough speed into it

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:39.470 
once you take enough speed into it
you're<00:03:38.489> eventually<00:03:38.670> going<00:03:39.030> to<00:03:39.120> come<00:03:39.269> off<00:03:39.450> the

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
you're eventually going to come off the

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.960 
you're eventually going to come off the
end<00:03:39.720> so<00:03:40.410> you<00:03:40.440> ultimately<00:03:41.069> have<00:03:41.250> two<00:03:41.459> options

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
end so you ultimately have two options

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:43.490 
end so you ultimately have two options
of<00:03:42.090> how<00:03:42.180> you're<00:03:42.329> going<00:03:42.419> to<00:03:42.480> come<00:03:42.690> off<00:03:42.870> are<00:03:43.349> you

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
of how you're going to come off are you

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.650 
of how you're going to come off are you
going<00:03:43.650> to<00:03:43.709> come<00:03:43.829> off<00:03:43.980> landing<00:03:44.340> forward<00:03:44.760> or<00:03:44.940> are

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
going to come off landing forward or are

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.059 
going to come off landing forward or are
you<00:03:45.750> going<00:03:45.900> to<00:03:45.959> come<00:03:46.079> off<00:03:46.230> landing<00:03:46.560> fakie

00:03:47.059 --> 00:03:47.069 
you going to come off landing fakie

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:49.610 
you going to come off landing fakie
either<00:03:47.849> way<00:03:48.090> you<00:03:48.150> do<00:03:48.450> this<00:03:48.660> the<00:03:49.200> main<00:03:49.380> thing

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
either way you do this the main thing

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.199 
either way you do this the main thing
that<00:03:49.650> you're<00:03:49.859> going<00:03:49.980> to<00:03:50.010> want<00:03:50.190> to<00:03:50.250> do<00:03:50.459> is<00:03:50.700> when

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:51.209 
that you're going to want to do is when

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:52.520 
that you're going to want to do is when
you're<00:03:51.329> getting<00:03:51.599> off<00:03:51.750> the<00:03:51.930> rail<00:03:52.079> you<00:03:52.290> want<00:03:52.470> to

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
you're getting off the rail you want to

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:54.319 
you're getting off the rail you want to
have<00:03:52.680> I<00:03:52.919> always<00:03:53.579> think<00:03:53.940> when<00:03:54.000> you<00:03:54.150> get<00:03:54.239> a

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:54.329 
have I always think when you get a

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:56.539 
have I always think when you get a
slight<00:03:54.630> pop<00:03:55.049> off<00:03:55.349> a<00:03:55.380> slight<00:03:55.950> little<00:03:56.160> jump

00:03:56.539 --> 00:03:56.549 
slight pop off a slight little jump

00:03:56.549 --> 00:03:58.039 
slight pop off a slight little jump
whether<00:03:56.970> it's<00:03:57.209> it<00:03:57.359> doesn't<00:03:57.540> have<00:03:57.780> to<00:03:57.900> be<00:03:58.019> a

00:03:58.039 --> 00:03:58.049 
whether it's it doesn't have to be a

00:03:58.049 --> 00:03:59.599 
whether it's it doesn't have to be a
hard<00:03:58.260> jump<00:03:58.590> even<00:03:58.919> if<00:03:59.010> it's<00:03:59.160> something<00:03:59.430> like<00:03:59.459> a

00:03:59.599 --> 00:03:59.609 
hard jump even if it's something like a

00:03:59.609 --> 00:04:01.699 
hard jump even if it's something like a
hop<00:03:59.910> off<00:04:00.180> it<00:04:00.870> just<00:04:00.900> makes<00:04:01.230> you<00:04:01.349> feel<00:04:01.380> a<00:04:01.560> little

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:01.709 
hop off it just makes you feel a little

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:03.620 
hop off it just makes you feel a little
bit<00:04:01.919> more<00:04:02.099> stable<00:04:02.370> so<00:04:03.209> whether<00:04:03.419> you're

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:03.630 
bit more stable so whether you're

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:06.229 
bit more stable so whether you're
hopping<00:04:04.049> forward<00:04:04.530> or<00:04:04.680> hopping<00:04:05.099> fakie<00:04:05.519> just

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:06.239 
hopping forward or hopping fakie just

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:07.789 
hopping forward or hopping fakie just
make<00:04:06.419> sure<00:04:06.660> you<00:04:06.810> just<00:04:06.989> give<00:04:07.169> it<00:04:07.290> a<00:04:07.349> little<00:04:07.500> pop

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:07.799 
make sure you just give it a little pop

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:10.339 
make sure you just give it a little pop
and<00:04:07.829> land<00:04:08.220> fakie<00:04:08.430> or<00:04:08.910> give<00:04:09.840> it<00:04:09.930> a<00:04:09.959> little<00:04:10.079> pop

00:04:10.339 --> 00:04:10.349 
and land fakie or give it a little pop

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:12.830 
and land fakie or give it a little pop
and<00:04:10.680> just<00:04:11.250> land<00:04:11.430> forward<00:04:11.940> so<00:04:12.450> now<00:04:12.599> that<00:04:12.690> I've

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:12.840 
and just land forward so now that I've

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.470 
and just land forward so now that I've
basically<00:04:13.019> went<00:04:13.560> over<00:04:13.889> how<00:04:14.069> you<00:04:14.130> would<00:04:14.480> set

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:15.480 
basically went over how you would set

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:18.020 
basically went over how you would set
your<00:04:15.540> body<00:04:15.840> or<00:04:16.260> even<00:04:16.950> if<00:04:17.039> you<00:04:17.130> wanted<00:04:17.400> to<00:04:17.549> start

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.030 
your body or even if you wanted to start

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:19.490 
your body or even if you wanted to start
practicing<00:04:18.570> on<00:04:18.660> something<00:04:19.019> like<00:04:19.169> a<00:04:19.229> line

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.500 
practicing on something like a line

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.620 
practicing on something like a line
we're<00:04:20.400> now<00:04:20.519> going<00:04:20.669> to<00:04:20.760> move<00:04:20.880> on<00:04:21.060> to<00:04:21.239> the<00:04:21.419> rail

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:21.630 
we're now going to move on to the rail

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:23.320 
we're now going to move on to the rail
and<00:04:21.840> I'm<00:04:21.930> going<00:04:22.049> to<00:04:22.109> show<00:04:22.289> you<00:04:22.349> how<00:04:22.650> exactly

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:23.330 
and I'm going to show you how exactly

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:32.930 
and I'm going to show you how exactly
everything<00:04:24.330> is<00:04:24.419> going<00:04:24.570> to<00:04:24.599> work<00:04:24.780> in<00:04:24.930> this<00:04:25.050> case

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:32.940 

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:35.189 

so<00:04:33.940> when<00:04:34.090> you're<00:04:34.210> approaching<00:04:34.690> the<00:04:34.810> rail<00:04:34.990> to

00:04:35.189 --> 00:04:35.199 
so when you're approaching the rail to

00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:37.950 
so when you're approaching the rail to
do<00:04:35.290> the<00:04:35.440> grind<00:04:36.030> the<00:04:37.030> best<00:04:37.240> thing<00:04:37.479> to<00:04:37.510> do<00:04:37.660> a<00:04:37.690> lot

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:37.960 
do the grind the best thing to do a lot

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:40.500 
do the grind the best thing to do a lot
of<00:04:38.080> times<00:04:38.290> if<00:04:38.530> you<00:04:38.590> don't<00:04:38.650> know<00:04:38.919> the<00:04:39.070> speed<00:04:39.510> you

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:40.510 
of times if you don't know the speed you

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:42.659 
of times if you don't know the speed you
kind<00:04:40.750> of<00:04:40.810> want<00:04:40.990> to<00:04:41.050> go<00:04:41.199> at<00:04:41.350> it<00:04:41.380> at<00:04:41.740> a<00:04:41.800> at<00:04:42.340> a<00:04:42.400> low

00:04:42.659 --> 00:04:42.669 
kind of want to go at it at a at a low

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:44.460 
kind of want to go at it at a at a low
speed<00:04:42.699> and<00:04:43.180> just<00:04:43.360> kind<00:04:43.540> of<00:04:43.570> test<00:04:43.870> out<00:04:44.080> how<00:04:44.290> it

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:44.470 
speed and just kind of test out how it

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:46.469 
speed and just kind of test out how it
slides<00:04:44.710> see<00:04:45.190> how<00:04:45.340> it<00:04:45.580> fills<00:04:45.760> there's<00:04:46.030> no<00:04:46.210> need

00:04:46.469 --> 00:04:46.479 
slides see how it fills there's no need

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:48.750 
slides see how it fills there's no need
in<00:04:47.050> trying<00:04:47.680> to<00:04:47.830> do<00:04:47.949> it<00:04:48.070> first<00:04:48.310> try<00:04:48.520> it<00:04:48.639> you

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:48.760 
in trying to do it first try it you

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:50.219 
in trying to do it first try it you
might<00:04:48.910> as<00:04:49.030> well<00:04:49.090> get<00:04:49.419> comfortable<00:04:49.840> with<00:04:50.080> the

00:04:50.219 --> 00:04:50.229 
might as well get comfortable with the

00:04:50.229 --> 00:04:53.189 
might as well get comfortable with the
obstacle<00:04:50.770> and<00:04:51.010> make<00:04:51.190> sure<00:04:51.400> it<00:04:51.580> feels<00:04:51.820> right<00:04:52.199> so

00:04:53.189 --> 00:04:53.199 
obstacle and make sure it feels right so

00:04:53.199 --> 00:04:54.750 
obstacle and make sure it feels right so
right<00:04:53.380> now<00:04:53.560> I'm<00:04:53.710> going<00:04:53.830> to<00:04:53.919> do<00:04:54.040> that<00:04:54.220> I'm<00:04:54.580> going

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:54.760 
right now I'm going to do that I'm going

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:57.540 
right now I'm going to do that I'm going
to<00:04:54.820> go<00:04:54.970> at<00:04:55.510> a<00:04:55.720> normal<00:04:56.350> speed<00:04:56.380> I'm<00:04:57.010> not<00:04:57.340> going<00:04:57.490> to

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:57.550 
to go at a normal speed I'm not going to

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:58.800 
to go at a normal speed I'm not going to
try<00:04:57.699> and<00:04:57.729> do<00:04:57.940> the<00:04:58.060> whole<00:04:58.180> thing<00:04:58.449> I'm<00:04:58.630> just

00:04:58.800 --> 00:04:58.810 
try and do the whole thing I'm just

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:00.029 
try and do the whole thing I'm just
going<00:04:58.930> to<00:04:58.960> get<00:04:59.199> on<00:04:59.380> to<00:04:59.620> where<00:04:59.770> it<00:04:59.889> feels

00:05:00.029 --> 00:05:00.039 
going to get on to where it feels

00:05:00.039 --> 00:05:08.640 
going to get on to where it feels
comfortable<00:05:00.300> so<00:05:01.300> here<00:05:01.479> we<00:05:01.570> go<00:05:01.720> so<00:05:07.350> as<00:05:08.350> you<00:05:08.530> can

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:08.650 
comfortable so here we go so as you can

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:11.670 
comfortable so here we go so as you can
see<00:05:08.710> that<00:05:09.010> time<00:05:09.310> I<00:05:10.199> put<00:05:11.199> all<00:05:11.320> the<00:05:11.440> steps

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:11.680 
see that time I put all the steps

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:13.620 
see that time I put all the steps
together<00:05:11.830> like<00:05:12.190> I<00:05:12.310> told<00:05:12.550> you<00:05:12.789> I<00:05:13.000> went<00:05:13.389> out<00:05:13.510> of

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:13.630 
together like I told you I went out of

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:15.510 
together like I told you I went out of
minimal<00:05:13.930> speed<00:05:14.139> and<00:05:14.530> obviously<00:05:15.100> I<00:05:15.190> didn't<00:05:15.430> get

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:15.520 
minimal speed and obviously I didn't get

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:17.700 
minimal speed and obviously I didn't get
across<00:05:15.789> the<00:05:16.000> whole<00:05:16.180> rail<00:05:16.419> but<00:05:17.260> that<00:05:17.410> was<00:05:17.530> kind

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:17.710 
across the whole rail but that was kind

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:19.230 
across the whole rail but that was kind
of<00:05:17.770> the<00:05:17.860> goal<00:05:18.039> of<00:05:18.070> the<00:05:18.280> exercise<00:05:18.550> just<00:05:19.030> so<00:05:19.150> you

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:19.240 
of the goal of the exercise just so you

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:21.120 
of the goal of the exercise just so you
can<00:05:19.389> feel<00:05:19.570> comfortable<00:05:20.139> make<00:05:20.680> sure<00:05:20.830> you<00:05:20.979> know

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:21.130 
can feel comfortable make sure you know

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:22.200 
can feel comfortable make sure you know
the<00:05:21.280> speed<00:05:21.550> of<00:05:21.669> what<00:05:21.789> you're<00:05:21.940> going<00:05:22.060> to<00:05:22.120> be

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:22.210 
the speed of what you're going to be

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:24.300 
the speed of what you're going to be
grinding<00:05:22.660> on<00:05:22.810> and<00:05:23.080> putting<00:05:23.830> all<00:05:24.130> the

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:24.310 
grinding on and putting all the

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:27.090 
grinding on and putting all the
techniques<00:05:24.729> into<00:05:25.000> play<00:05:25.410> so<00:05:26.410> next<00:05:26.650> I'm<00:05:27.039> going

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:27.100 
techniques into play so next I'm going

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:28.620 
techniques into play so next I'm going
to<00:05:27.220> show<00:05:27.280> you<00:05:27.430> how<00:05:27.669> you<00:05:27.729> would<00:05:27.970> actually<00:05:28.150> go

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:28.630 
to show you how you would actually go

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:30.750 
to show you how you would actually go
about<00:05:29.050> doing<00:05:29.440> it<00:05:29.560> after<00:05:30.010> you<00:05:30.130> know<00:05:30.280> the<00:05:30.520> way<00:05:30.639> it

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:30.760 
about doing it after you know the way it

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:37.190 
about doing it after you know the way it
slides<00:05:30.910> and<00:05:31.419> the<00:05:31.599> way<00:05:31.750> the<00:05:31.930> obstacles<00:05:32.440> set<00:05:32.650> up

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:37.200 

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:40.290 

so<00:05:38.200> basically<00:05:38.349> for<00:05:38.830> this<00:05:38.979> one<00:05:39.250> I<00:05:39.460> know<00:05:39.789> I<00:05:40.030> need

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:40.300 
so basically for this one I know I need

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:42.360 
so basically for this one I know I need
a<00:05:40.330> little<00:05:40.510> bit<00:05:40.660> more<00:05:40.870> speed<00:05:41.169> I<00:05:41.380> know<00:05:42.010> how<00:05:42.310> the

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:42.370 
a little bit more speed I know how the

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:44.279 
a little bit more speed I know how the
obstacle<00:05:42.910> slides<00:05:43.240> now<00:05:43.570> and<00:05:43.840> I<00:05:43.900> know<00:05:43.990> how<00:05:44.229> the

00:05:44.279 --> 00:05:44.289 
obstacle slides now and I know how the

00:05:44.289 --> 00:05:46.589 
obstacle slides now and I know how the
bank<00:05:44.560> ramps<00:05:44.950> are<00:05:45.099> so<00:05:45.789> the<00:05:45.970> only<00:05:46.240> thing<00:05:46.419> that<00:05:46.570> I

00:05:46.589 --> 00:05:46.599 
bank ramps are so the only thing that I

00:05:46.599 --> 00:05:48.719 
bank ramps are so the only thing that I
need<00:05:46.750> to<00:05:46.990> do<00:05:47.169> is<00:05:47.410> put<00:05:47.889> all<00:05:47.919> the<00:05:48.160> steps<00:05:48.430> in<00:05:48.639> to

00:05:48.719 --> 00:05:48.729 
need to do is put all the steps in to

00:05:48.729 --> 00:05:52.080 
need to do is put all the steps in to
play<00:05:48.970> so<00:05:49.630> I<00:05:49.690> need<00:05:49.840> to<00:05:49.930> get<00:05:50.080> on<00:05:50.760> put<00:05:51.760> my<00:05:51.880> boot

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:52.090 
play so I need to get on put my boot

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:54.360 
play so I need to get on put my boot
down<00:05:52.300> make<00:05:52.990> sure<00:05:53.169> the<00:05:53.289> rail<00:05:53.500> situated<00:05:54.190> in<00:05:54.280> the

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:54.370 
down make sure the rail situated in the

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:56.610 
down make sure the rail situated in the
middle<00:05:54.610> of<00:05:54.669> my<00:05:54.820> frames<00:05:55.180> have<00:05:55.960> my<00:05:56.110> shoulders

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:56.620 
middle of my frames have my shoulders

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:58.350 
middle of my frames have my shoulders
parallel<00:05:57.190> with<00:05:57.370> my<00:05:57.490> body<00:05:57.699> and<00:05:57.849> have<00:05:58.060> my<00:05:58.180> head

00:05:58.350 --> 00:05:58.360 
parallel with my body and have my head

00:05:58.360 --> 00:05:59.969 
parallel with my body and have my head
looking<00:05:58.660> forward<00:05:58.990> facing<00:05:59.410> the<00:05:59.500> direction<00:05:59.620> I'm

00:05:59.969 --> 00:05:59.979 
looking forward facing the direction I'm

00:05:59.979 --> 00:06:02.700 
looking forward facing the direction I'm
going<00:06:00.310> so<00:06:01.120> here<00:06:01.389> we<00:06:01.510> go<00:06:01.720> with<00:06:02.110> all<00:06:02.289> the<00:06:02.410> steps

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:02.710 
going so here we go with all the steps

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:16.160 
going so here we go with all the steps
combined

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:16.170 

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:20.010 

and<00:06:17.170> as<00:06:17.890> you<00:06:17.980> can<00:06:18.100> see<00:06:18.160> with<00:06:18.430> that<00:06:18.610> one<00:06:18.790> I<00:06:19.020> took

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:20.020 
and as you can see with that one I took

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:21.750 
and as you can see with that one I took
a<00:06:20.110> lot<00:06:20.230> more<00:06:20.440> speed<00:06:20.710> into<00:06:20.920> it<00:06:21.220> I<00:06:21.340> knew<00:06:21.580> how<00:06:21.730> I

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:21.760 
a lot more speed into it I knew how I

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:24.240 
a lot more speed into it I knew how I
was<00:06:21.880> going<00:06:21.970> to<00:06:22.030> slide<00:06:22.360> I<00:06:22.950> situated<00:06:23.950> the<00:06:24.040> rail

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:24.250 
was going to slide I situated the rail

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:26.640 
was going to slide I situated the rail
in<00:06:24.610> between<00:06:24.970> my<00:06:25.120> frames<00:06:25.510> got<00:06:26.020> my<00:06:26.170> boot<00:06:26.410> down

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:26.650 
in between my frames got my boot down

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:29.760 
in between my frames got my boot down
got<00:06:27.520> the<00:06:27.550> my<00:06:28.150> bodyweight<00:06:28.510> over<00:06:28.990> my<00:06:29.140> skates<00:06:29.470> and

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:29.770 
got the my bodyweight over my skates and

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:31.440 
got the my bodyweight over my skates and
had<00:06:29.860> my<00:06:30.010> shoulders<00:06:30.370> parallel<00:06:30.610> in<00:06:31.120> my<00:06:31.270> head

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:31.450 
had my shoulders parallel in my head

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:34.170 
had my shoulders parallel in my head
facing<00:06:31.660> the<00:06:31.990> direction<00:06:32.350> I<00:06:32.440> was<00:06:32.590> going<00:06:33.180> landed

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:34.180 
facing the direction I was going landed
