00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:25.370
 Hi, I 'm the nun at the restaurant. 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.440
 Dona Lucinha Sao Paulo 

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:29.770
 Let's make today for you readers of 

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:32.690
 my magazine covers a recipe 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:34.580
 wonderful cookie sprinkle recipe 

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:37.780
 of yours from my land in the 

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:42.410
 Jequitinhonha in Minas Gerais 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:45.620
 the first thing a pound of sprinkle 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:49.280
 sour and how much was the invitation 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:57.230
 I'll put it on the fire with a glass of 200 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:01:00.860
 ml of oil and one tablespoon of 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:04.130
 salt and this goes to the fire is in 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:07.220
 How much is going to set there fire ? 

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:09.020
 with the same measure cold water at 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:12.979
 ambient temperature 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:17.899
 an American cup 200 ml of water because 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:21.200
 I need to make a spoon until 

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:23.119
 dissolve all the cores by 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:27.729
 Spaghetti biscuit look good can not 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:27.729
 let the lumps that have're here 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:35.820
 As it is very oil now, it is very 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:40.320
 hot I'm forced to use a spoon 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:44.660
 until the oil cools a little bit and I go 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.660
 do the same thing I did with water 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:52.650
 now she 's starting to cool down 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:57.210
 I'll put all the milk and temperature 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:58.800
 environment and I will put the two eggs 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:02.280
 the last ingredient 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:08.190
 now it's just the arm you 're turning 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:11.240
 pan and just adding the ingredients until 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.240
 give the right spot 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:17.820
 If you ask me that, you could do 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:20.790
 in the mixer these cookie recipes 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:23.670
 old so can not do in 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:25.740
 has to do on hand because it 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:28.410
 do not make the mixer she goes with it 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:30.690
 will give too much glue will be very 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:34.950
 elastic and rolled up is difficult 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:38.989
 to the touch beauty touch a creamy spot 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:41.100
 but if you take the hand like that 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:43.680
 lord of the rings 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:46.709
 in the group for a long time I'll get the 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:49.280
 amount I find interesting with 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:49.280
 your little ball 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:57.460
 where two steps have been taken and this 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:03:02.910
 revenue grows a lot can do 

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:02.910
 also hoop hoop is another option 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:21.460
 ready let's take the oven 25 minutes in the 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:24.580
 dry kiln combined with water vapor to 

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:26.650
 180 degrees at home 180graus 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:29.400
 I also believe that from 25 to 30 minutes 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:29.400
 at home 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:51.829
