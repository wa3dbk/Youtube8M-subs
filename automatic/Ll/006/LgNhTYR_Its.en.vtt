won't<00:00:45.420> take<00:00:45.570> a<00:00:45.629> genius<00:00:46.289> to<00:00:46.500> figure<00:00:46.620> out<00:00:47.039> but

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
won't take a genius to figure out but

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.220 
won't take a genius to figure out but
they<00:00:47.610> will<00:00:47.760> make<00:00:48.149> it<00:00:48.300> get<00:00:48.480> some<00:00:48.780> puzzles<00:00:49.140> we'll

they will make it get some puzzles we'll
make<00:00:49.350> a<00:00:49.379> guess<00:00:49.590> at<00:00:49.770> least<00:00:49.800> for<00:00:50.160> a<00:00:50.219> good<00:00:50.370> while

00:00:51.279 --> 00:00:51.289 
make a guess at least for a good while

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:54.049 
make a guess at least for a good while
for<00:00:52.289> example<00:00:52.710> there's<00:00:52.860> one<00:00:53.039> puzzle<00:00:53.670> involving

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
half hour to figure out and the end boss

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.139 
half hour to figure out and the end boss
that<00:01:00.390> puzzle<00:01:01.219> you<00:01:02.219> will<00:01:02.399> be<00:01:02.550> scratching<00:01:03.000> head

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
for a little while it's pretty simple

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.399 
for a little while it's pretty simple
when<00:01:04.769> you<00:01:04.830> finally<00:01:05.100> do<00:01:05.339> figure<00:01:05.640> it<00:01:05.729> out<00:01:05.880> but

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:06.409 
when you finally do figure it out but

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:08.390 
when you finally do figure it out but
but<00:01:07.409> you<00:01:07.500> don't<00:01:07.650> know<00:01:07.740> what<00:01:07.890> it's<00:01:08.010> clickable
