 James they have animated the main character in the board 

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:11.420
 me and a bunch of other people it was right that each of the animation

 himself and his team headed by other animators 

00:00:15.029 --> 00:00:17.689
 can you tell me something about the work? 

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:22.640
 To know more about Carinthia, this was definitely the most challenging thing I have ever done 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.680
 it was not just a normal trick and he is very 

00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:27.510
 realistic in his drawings 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.009
 So we had too many mistakes in the Czech Republic as they move 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:34.310
 and how anatomy opens it to "The Wrestler" of her muscle weapon 

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:36.610
 start for it 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:37.530
 on 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.800
 they should look right and that was the hardest part of these goals 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.230
 for the animation 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:45.230
 that could 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:50.300
 She is a little sample giving the times as we can 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.730
 while continuing to rank 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:55.730
 which were successful 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.110

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.110
 Now there is a pattern in which they have very big cat in his own

 Tecops design is the part of the most unrealistic is uncertain of most

 then runs Anorak Euro

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:30.850
 this horse has eyebrows you can see that white his eyes 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:34.480
 we had to do that so that it can not consume his feelings 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:37.950
 SID we had to do that over the face and some 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.950

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.890
 rather that of a horse 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.040
 if something an animation a sausage you have to know the original very well and

 The box is the device is a mixture of traditional hand-painted 

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:32.959
 and computer animation is the future of human animation 

00:02:33.759 --> 00:02:35.709

 but Brenden luggage I think in the future it will be a lot of different 

00:02:42.999 --> 00:02:46.489

 how do i want from what i want for

00:03:12.939 --> 00:03:14.979

00:03:14.979 --> 00:03:19.269
 The computer can show the opponents of the handmade cartoon

 Oh no, it's all animation animators use another 

00:03:31.639 --> 00:03:34.979
 Technology but you need the same knowledge you have to know how to 

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:37.659
 Work you have to carry out because you have to go over 

00:03:37.659 --> 00:03:41.519
 the mechanics that fit are modestly it is the same know 

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:42.959

 what a movie is and whether the traditional characters are suited to art 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:09.599
 I think there is always a place that we if the German word

 the main character of the brightest does not say a word that was really very 

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:40.599
 gratifying APA

 No, but it can speak with a speaker and the first voice 

00:04:56.189 --> 00:04:59.900
 Rowing the character will match the voice to the rest if you have a great voice 

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:02.900
 It can be great and fun 

00:05:03.729 --> 00:05:07.029
 so lending it was very nice to know that the complete 

00:05:07.029 --> 00:05:10.520
 Resting work on the shoulders of the animation would be a challenge 

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:13.570

 it is still single even though it is sometimes a different medium

 That's not what the first thriller is all new by hand
