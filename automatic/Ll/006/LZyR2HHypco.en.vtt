00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.190
 grabbed in my west Knesset 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.080
 let go of Sargis Ovsepyan 

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:39.670
 no what is it in the hands they held him 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:41.000
 defenders of the national team of Armenia let's 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.670
 our defenders 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:48.000
 parts insured Ignashevich with 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.960
 defense partners army team beat 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.960
 at first the god preserved were beaten 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:57.420
 we will be able to evaluate 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.820
 but how family friends cut the defense 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:02.760
 why this is difficult there was a blow 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.330
 which did not work very well played 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:07.310
 semshov 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:10.440

 good pass ah 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:25.240
 lacked concentration 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.240
 I still need to think about it 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:33.100
 look here 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.170
 for our countries 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:38.170
 both were already all 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:40.980
 and no danger already 

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:43.000
 technically way out year mark spitz any 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.010
 years could not imagine he could bring to 50 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:48.760
 brigade can be ours and almost scored 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:50.840

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.840
 Berezovsky as it turned out 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.110
 417 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:03.140
 before the european championship 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:07.530
 at 21 from 32 to 34 degrees already 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:08.859
 almost nonstop 

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:10.069
 according to him 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:11.489
 I did not immediately and no more 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.160
 clear transfer however myself 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.139
 not on semshova now ends 

00:02:16.139 --> 00:02:17.779
 imagine on the neck 

00:02:17.779 --> 00:02:19.949
 he bred again Pavlyuchenko breed 

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:23.189
 his dane does 

00:02:23.189 --> 00:02:24.919
 advise more if you consider what 

00:02:24.919 --> 00:02:27.819
 he had concerns food london 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:29.889
 for example last time 

00:02:29.889 --> 00:02:33.079
 one of the favorite sheds in the tournament in 

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:35.559
 overall so struck in the form of 800 million transfer 

00:02:35.559 --> 00:02:37.409
 so a little respite to cancel 

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:40.229
 collection close thousand top of the second half 

00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:43.209
 and now is not the moment already under 40 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:45.509
 penalty 

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:48.009
 let's say as zhirkov did not 

00:02:48.009 --> 00:02:49.529
 interfere 

00:02:49.529 --> 00:02:51.599
 gradually topple everything went to the end 

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:53.389
 play 

00:02:53.389 --> 00:02:55.049
 when hitting the point 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:58.169
 Pavlyuchenko opel

 Berezovsky made a move 

00:03:02.539 --> 00:03:04.109
 Pavlyuchenko struck 

00:03:04.109 --> 00:03:07.109
 exactly centered and we sometimes 

00:03:08.059 --> 00:03:11.059
 to be completely accurate 

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:15.119
 in the fortieth match with the national team 

00:03:15.119 --> 00:03:17.859
