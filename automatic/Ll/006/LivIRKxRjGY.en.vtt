American<00:01:33.240> players<00:01:33.479> are<00:01:33.689> not<00:01:33.990> going<00:01:34.200> to<00:01:34.290> be

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
American players are not going to be

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.520

happy at the same time are you is it

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:38.749 
happy at the same time are you is it
going<00:01:37.799> to<00:01:37.860> make<00:01:37.950> any<00:01:38.100> difference<00:01:38.280> to<00:01:38.640> the

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
going to make any difference to the

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.730 
going to make any difference to the
level<00:01:39.270> of<00:01:39.390> an<00:01:39.479> American<00:01:39.930> player<00:01:40.170> just<00:01:40.439> because

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
level of an American player just because

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.350 
level of an American player just because
there's<00:01:40.979> more<00:01:41.159> money<00:01:41.400> I<00:01:41.520> don't<00:01:41.850> think<00:01:42.030> it<00:01:42.180> does

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
there's more money I don't think it does

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.840 
there's more money I don't think it does
so<00:01:42.930> for<00:01:43.290> me<00:01:43.439> I<00:01:43.470> think<00:01:43.710> the<00:01:43.920> money<00:01:44.130> has<00:01:44.670> to<00:01:44.700> be

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
so for me I think the money has to be

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.940 
so for me I think the money has to be
spent<00:01:44.970> initially<00:01:45.659> on<00:01:45.810> bringing<00:01:46.409> in<00:01:46.680> better

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
spent initially on bringing in better

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.069 
spent initially on bringing in better
foreign<00:01:47.490> players<00:01:47.729> nothing<00:01:48.479> called<00:01:48.659> American

of us are owners in MLS and so when the

of us are owners in MLS and so when the
television<00:03:04.730> ratings<00:03:04.880> are<00:03:05.330> what<00:03:05.510> they<00:03:05.660> are<00:03:05.840> and

when you're not making any money how do

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:11.180

00:03:20.229 --> 00:03:20.239 
where the money is going to be made and

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:22.270 
where the money is going to be made and
I<00:03:20.390> think<00:03:20.660> most<00:03:20.870> of<00:03:21.019> us<00:03:21.110> would<00:03:21.320> say<00:03:21.350> the<00:03:21.920> quality

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:22.280 
I think most of us would say the quality

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.759 
I think most of us would say the quality
of<00:03:22.400> play<00:03:22.610> needs<00:03:22.850> to<00:03:22.970> be<00:03:23.120> better<00:03:23.410> but<00:03:24.410> I<00:03:24.440> don't

00:03:24.759 --> 00:03:24.769 
of play needs to be better but I don't

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:26.500 
of play needs to be better but I don't
know<00:03:24.980> if<00:03:25.280> that's<00:03:25.489> gonna<00:03:25.640> happen<00:03:26.060> as<00:03:26.239> we

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:26.510 
know if that's gonna happen as we

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:29.350 
know if that's gonna happen as we
continue<00:03:27.049> to<00:03:27.230> expand<00:03:27.769> one<00:03:28.430> two<00:03:28.730> teams<00:03:29.030> every

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:29.360 
continue to expand one two teams every

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:30.610 
continue to expand one two teams every
single<00:03:29.630> year<00:03:29.810> I<00:03:29.840> think<00:03:29.959> there<00:03:30.200> has<00:03:30.380> to<00:03:30.410> be<00:03:30.530> a

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:30.620 
single year I think there has to be a

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:33.280

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:36.829 
this league it's flourishing in so many

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:38.470 
this league it's flourishing in so many
other<00:03:37.070> categories<00:03:37.310> you<00:03:37.700> agree<00:03:38.150> with<00:03:38.329> what

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:38.480 
other categories you agree with what

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:40.750 
other categories you agree with what
Taylor's<00:03:38.840> doing<00:03:38.989> and<00:03:39.290> can<00:03:39.799> the<00:03:39.920> money<00:03:40.130> spent

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760 
Taylor's doing and can the money spent

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:43.180 
Taylor's doing and can the money spent
eventually<00:03:41.570> aid<00:03:42.140> the<00:03:42.620> league<00:03:42.799> in<00:03:43.040> that

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:43.190 
eventually aid the league in that

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:45.520 
eventually aid the league in that
department<00:03:43.519> it<00:03:44.480> can<00:03:44.870> but<00:03:45.110> I<00:03:45.140> think<00:03:45.410> it's

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:45.530 
department it can but I think it's

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:48.220 
department it can but I think it's
important<00:03:46.010> to<00:03:46.070> to<00:03:46.730> think<00:03:46.970> about<00:03:47.239> this<00:03:47.510> quality

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:48.230 
important to to think about this quality

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:49.930 
important to to think about this quality
of<00:03:48.320> play<00:03:48.590> or<00:03:48.769> standard<00:03:49.340> of<00:03:49.430> play

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:51.950 
very few people a lot of people talk

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:53.170 
very few people a lot of people talk
about<00:03:51.980> it<00:03:52.280> but<00:03:52.370> very<00:03:52.400> few<00:03:52.579> people<00:03:52.760> actually

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:53.180 
about it but very few people actually

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:55.360 
about it but very few people actually
define<00:03:53.870> it<00:03:54.049> when<00:03:54.170> it<00:03:54.260> comes<00:03:54.440> to<00:03:54.680> MLS<00:03:55.100> and<00:03:55.280> we've

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:10.370 
of quality it's very difficult sometimes

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:12.250 
of quality it's very difficult sometimes
for<00:04:10.579> people<00:04:10.880> to<00:04:10.970> point<00:04:11.150> out<00:04:11.299> specific<00:04:11.989> things

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:12.260 
for people to point out specific things

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.770 
for people to point out specific things
that<00:04:12.440> happen<00:04:12.769> on<00:04:12.920> the<00:04:12.950> field<00:04:13.370> that<00:04:14.030> make<00:04:14.329> it<00:04:14.540> so

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:14.780

they talk about well you know the the

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:19.120 
they talk about well you know the the
way<00:04:17.690> that<00:04:17.840> it's<00:04:17.959> looked<00:04:18.229> at<00:04:18.350> and<00:04:18.530> perception

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:19.130 
way that it's looked at and perception

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:20.170 
way that it's looked at and perception
from<00:04:19.190> the<00:04:19.310> outside<00:04:19.370> and<00:04:19.760> believe<00:04:19.970> me<00:04:20.060> that's

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:20.180 
from the outside and believe me that's

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:22.060 
from the outside and believe me that's
an<00:04:20.329> important<00:04:20.750> part<00:04:20.900> of<00:04:21.079> sports<00:04:21.380> but<00:04:21.859> when<00:04:21.979> you

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:22.070 
an important part of sports but when you

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:24.100 
an important part of sports but when you
actually<00:04:22.280> look<00:04:22.580> at<00:04:22.849> the<00:04:22.940> play<00:04:23.240> on<00:04:23.479> the<00:04:23.510> field<00:04:23.660> I

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:24.110 
actually look at the play on the field I

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:25.630 
actually look at the play on the field I
would<00:04:24.169> argue<00:04:24.530> that<00:04:24.919> it's<00:04:25.190> a<00:04:25.250> much<00:04:25.280> higher

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:25.640 
would argue that it's a much higher

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:27.620 
would argue that it's a much higher
quality<00:04:25.940> than<00:04:26.240> people<00:04:26.599> give<00:04:26.750> it<00:04:26.900> credit<00:04:26.930> for

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:27.630 
quality than people give it credit for

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:28.640 
quality than people give it credit for
now<00:04:27.690> it's<00:04:27.870> not<00:04:28.020> necessarily<00:04:28.530> always

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:28.650 
now it's not necessarily always

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:30.410 
now it's not necessarily always
presented<00:04:29.190> in<00:04:29.280> the<00:04:29.370> greatest<00:04:29.700> of<00:04:29.820> boxes<00:04:30.270> and

we<00:04:30.480> all<00:04:30.630> know<00:04:30.840> that<00:04:31.200> that's<00:04:31.440> part<00:04:31.740> of<00:04:31.770> the

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:31.860 
we all know that that's part of the

we all know that that's part of the

presentation and that's part of what
