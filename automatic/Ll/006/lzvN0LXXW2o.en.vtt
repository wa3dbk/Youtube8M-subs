00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:42.660 
have to have a cycling scale of cycling
scale<00:02:37.209> of<00:02:39.540> at<00:02:40.540> least<00:02:40.810> like<00:02:41.080> about<00:02:41.860> a<00:02:42.100> quarter

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
scale of at least like about a quarter

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:46.289 
scale of at least like about a quarter
like<00:02:43.450> so<00:02:43.780> right<00:02:43.930> here<00:02:44.820> but<00:02:45.820> if<00:02:45.940> you<00:02:46.060> want<00:02:46.209> to

00:02:46.289 --> 00:02:46.299 
like so right here but if you want to

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:48.420 
like so right here but if you want to
actually<00:02:46.420> be<00:02:46.720> able<00:02:46.750> to<00:02:47.080> beat<00:02:47.799> it<00:02:47.950> I'd<00:02:48.130> say

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430 
actually be able to beat it I'd say

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:51.720 
actually be able to beat it I'd say
about<00:02:48.700> three<00:02:49.420> quarters<00:02:50.580> two<00:02:51.580> and<00:02:51.670> a<00:02:51.700> half

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
about three quarters two and a half

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:54.960 
about three quarters two and a half
quarters<00:02:52.709> yeah<00:02:53.709> so<00:02:54.040> get<00:02:54.250> a<00:02:54.310> lot<00:02:54.459> of<00:02:54.489> the

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
quarters yeah so get a lot of the

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:57.000 
quarters yeah so get a lot of the
buckling<00:02:55.330> still<00:02:55.570> unlocks<00:02:55.959> yes<00:02:56.380> like<00:02:56.680> six

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 
buckling still unlocks yes like six

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:59.550 
buckling still unlocks yes like six
lights<00:02:57.280> like<00:02:57.700> sixty<00:02:58.090> percent<00:02:58.239> 75<00:02:58.959> percent<00:02:59.260> or

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
lights like sixty percent 75 percent or

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.430 
lights like sixty percent 75 percent or
sixty<00:02:59.950> five<00:03:00.100> percent<00:03:00.430> some<00:03:00.549> of<00:03:00.670> it<00:03:01.140> more<00:03:02.140> yeah

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440 
sixty five percent some of it more yeah

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.430 
sixty five percent some of it more yeah
yeah<00:03:03.100> the<00:03:03.280> more<00:03:03.430> the<00:03:03.459> easier<00:03:03.940> it'll<00:03:04.120> be

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
yeah the more the easier it'll be

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:08.699 
yeah the more the easier it'll be
anyways<00:03:06.000> so<00:03:07.000> get<00:03:07.510> on<00:03:07.630> this<00:03:07.840> exact<00:03:08.200> bike<00:03:08.410> which

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:08.709 
anyways so get on this exact bike which

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:13.470 
anyways so get on this exact bike which
is<00:03:08.860> right<00:03:09.340> here<00:03:09.370> on<00:03:09.640> the<00:03:09.730> sill<00:03:09.940> this<00:03:10.720> one<00:03:12.480> okay

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
is right here on the sill this one okay

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:14.729 
is right here on the sill this one okay
so<00:03:13.540> you<00:03:13.870> have<00:03:14.080> to<00:03:14.230> collect<00:03:14.500> all<00:03:14.650> the

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:14.739 
so you have to collect all the

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:17.240 
so you have to collect all the
checkpoints<00:03:14.950> before<00:03:15.610> the<00:03:15.700> time<00:03:15.850> runs<00:03:15.880> out

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
checkpoints before the time runs out

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:21.120 
checkpoints before the time runs out
okay<00:03:18.250> so<00:03:18.970> let's<00:03:19.269> do<00:03:19.420> the<00:03:19.540> easy<00:03:19.660> ones

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:21.130 
okay so let's do the easy ones

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:24.570 
okay so let's do the easy ones
so<00:03:22.680> okay<00:03:23.680> for<00:03:23.890> now<00:03:23.920> it's<00:03:24.160> just<00:03:24.220> going<00:03:24.490> to<00:03:24.520> be

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:24.580 
so okay for now it's just going to be

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:31.520 
so okay for now it's just going to be
easy<00:03:24.820> jumping<00:03:25.330> so<00:03:25.950> just<00:03:26.950> pay<00:03:27.070> attention<00:03:27.870> and

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:34.290 

it<00:03:32.530> you<00:03:33.130> gotta<00:03:33.520> have<00:03:33.640> to<00:03:33.730> jump<00:03:33.940> around<00:03:34.030> that

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:34.300 
it you gotta have to jump around that

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:39.090 
it you gotta have to jump around that
would<00:03:36.300> this<00:03:37.300> is<00:03:37.510> where<00:03:37.690> it<00:03:37.750> gets<00:03:37.780> hard<00:03:37.990> this<00:03:38.920> is

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:39.100 
would this is where it gets hard this is

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:41.970 
would this is where it gets hard this is
probably<00:03:39.310> the<00:03:39.550> hardest<00:03:39.670> one<00:03:40.210> for<00:03:40.240> me<00:03:40.830> okay<00:03:41.830> now

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:41.980 
probably the hardest one for me okay now

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:44.670 
probably the hardest one for me okay now
the<00:03:42.040> trick<00:03:42.310> is<00:03:42.340> you're<00:03:42.970> going<00:03:43.120> to<00:03:43.210> want<00:03:43.330> to<00:03:43.680> get

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:44.680 
the trick is you're going to want to get

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.210 
the trick is you're going to want to get
enough<00:03:44.890> get<00:03:45.430> enough<00:03:45.610> speed<00:03:45.820> going<00:03:46.090> up<00:03:46.330> these

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
enough get enough speed going up these

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:49.830 
enough get enough speed going up these
half<00:03:48.220> pipes<00:03:48.490> quarter<00:03:48.850> pipes<00:03:49.030> and<00:03:49.210> like<00:03:49.300> it<00:03:49.420> and

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:49.840 
half pipes quarter pipes and like it and

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.170 
half pipes quarter pipes and like it and
bounce<00:03:50.260> off<00:03:50.560> we<00:03:50.770> hit<00:03:50.950> this<00:03:51.070> switch<00:03:51.280> S<00:03:51.820> is<00:03:52.000> our

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:52.180 
bounce off we hit this switch S is our

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:54.450 
bounce off we hit this switch S is our
you<00:03:52.630> will<00:03:52.780> be<00:03:52.900> better<00:03:53.140> than<00:03:53.620> pretty<00:03:54.100> much<00:03:54.250> all

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:54.460 
you will be better than pretty much all

00:03:54.460 --> 00:04:00.450 
you will be better than pretty much all
of<00:03:54.610> us<00:03:54.730> yeah<00:03:55.480> combined<00:03:57.000> sir<00:03:58.620> it<00:03:59.620> was<00:03:59.740> it<00:04:00.220> was

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:12.580 
this is where having like two and a half

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:15.150 
this is where having like two and a half
quarters<00:04:13.090> of<00:04:13.300> the<00:04:13.480> cycling<00:04:13.990> skill<00:04:14.290> up<00:04:14.440> you
