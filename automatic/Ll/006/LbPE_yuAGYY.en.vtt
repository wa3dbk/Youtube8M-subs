00:01:50.889 --> 00:01:50.899 

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:53.080 

so<00:01:51.619> I<00:01:51.649> did<00:01:51.920> kind<00:01:52.159> of<00:01:52.189> a<00:01:52.310> molesting<00:01:52.670> chopstick

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:53.090 
so I did kind of a molesting chopstick

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:55.120 
so I did kind of a molesting chopstick
underneath<00:01:53.509> because<00:01:53.840> my<00:01:54.649> lips<00:01:54.890> are<00:01:55.039> really

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.130 
underneath because my lips are really

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:57.370 
underneath because my lips are really
dry<00:01:55.280> so<00:01:56.030> that's<00:01:56.390> why<00:01:56.600> it's<00:01:56.750> not<00:01:56.810> drying<00:01:57.140> as

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380 
dry so that's why it's not drying as

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.139 
dry so that's why it's not drying as
fast<00:01:57.710> but<00:01:58.039> normally<00:01:58.399> as<00:01:58.490> soon<00:01:58.670> as<00:01:58.759> you<00:01:58.880> put<00:01:59.060> it

00:01:59.139 --> 00:01:59.149 
fast but normally as soon as you put it

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:02.410 
fast but normally as soon as you put it
on<00:01:59.299> it<00:01:59.509> dries<00:01:59.780> to<00:01:59.810> a<00:02:00.049> matte<00:02:00.490> on<00:02:01.490> me<00:02:01.909> this<00:02:02.149> color

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.420

alright so next we're gonna do the beige
color

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.150 

you

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.790 

and<00:02:59.850> so<00:03:00.330> you<00:03:00.480> see<00:03:00.690> with<00:03:01.020> a<00:03:01.080> little<00:03:01.470> bit<00:03:01.680> of

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:01.800 
and so you see with a little bit of

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:04.460 
and so you see with a little bit of
moisture<00:03:02.700> that<00:03:03.300> was<00:03:03.450> just<00:03:03.600> a<00:03:03.690> baby<00:03:03.870> wipe<00:03:04.140> it

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
moisture that was just a baby wipe it

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:08.030 
moisture that was just a baby wipe it
came<00:03:04.830> right<00:03:05.100> off<00:03:05.690> sometimes<00:03:06.690> I<00:03:06.900> also<00:03:07.110> use<00:03:07.560> oil

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
came right off sometimes I also use oil

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.650 
came right off sometimes I also use oil
to<00:03:08.100> take<00:03:08.310> it<00:03:08.430> off<00:03:08.550> because<00:03:08.790> it<00:03:09.060> is<00:03:09.090> a<00:03:09.210> lip<00:03:09.510> stain

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
to take it off because it is a lip stain

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:12.650 
to take it off because it is a lip stain
and<00:03:10.200> because<00:03:10.590> I<00:03:10.620> was<00:03:10.920> like<00:03:11.070> freshly<00:03:11.370> put<00:03:11.670> on<00:03:11.820> it

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
and because I was like freshly put on it

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.570 
and because I was like freshly put on it
was<00:03:12.840> easier<00:03:13.140> to<00:03:13.260> come<00:03:13.440> off<00:03:13.590> but<00:03:13.950> sometimes<00:03:14.400> it

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:14.580 
was easier to come off but sometimes it

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:19.130 
was easier to come off but sometimes it
is<00:03:14.730> a<00:03:14.970> little<00:03:15.360> tricky<00:03:15.600> so<00:03:16.460> either<00:03:17.460> oil<00:03:17.850> or<00:03:18.480> just

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140 
is a little tricky so either oil or just

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:21.770 
is a little tricky so either oil or just
a<00:03:19.290> lot<00:03:19.500> of<00:03:19.620> water<00:03:19.920> a<00:03:20.070> lot<00:03:20.460> of<00:03:20.640> moisture<00:03:21.330> but

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
a lot of water a lot of moisture but

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.650 
a lot of water a lot of moisture but
something<00:03:22.740> will<00:03:22.890> take<00:03:23.010> it<00:03:23.160> right<00:03:23.190> off<00:03:23.420> so<00:03:24.420> next

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
something will take it right off so next

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:26.720 
something will take it right off so next
is<00:03:24.930> the<00:03:25.320> beige<00:03:25.530> color<00:03:25.890> which<00:03:26.130> is<00:03:26.310> simply<00:03:26.700> the

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
is the beige color which is simply the

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:32.030 
is the beige color which is simply the
0-2<00:03:27.510> shade<00:03:27.810> and<00:03:29.480> just<00:03:30.480> like<00:03:30.660> how<00:03:30.930> the<00:03:31.500> red<00:03:31.740> it

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
0-2 shade and just like how the red it

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:41.479 
0-2 shade and just like how the red it
comes<00:03:32.250> cream<00:03:32.850> to<00:03:33.060> map

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:41.489 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:44.550 

now<00:03:42.489> this<00:03:42.730> might<00:03:42.940> be<00:03:43.120> my<00:03:43.269> favorite<00:03:43.300> shade<00:03:44.230> of

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:44.560 
now this might be my favorite shade of

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.530 
now this might be my favorite shade of
the<00:03:44.769> three<00:03:45.010> that<00:03:45.129> I<00:03:45.250> own<00:03:45.459> because<00:03:45.760> it<00:03:46.209> is<00:03:46.239> so

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540 
the three that I own because it is so

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:50.520 
the three that I own because it is so
nude<00:03:46.870> and<00:03:47.819> I<00:03:48.819> can<00:03:49.480> put<00:03:49.599> it<00:03:49.690> on<00:03:49.840> with<00:03:49.870> simply

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:50.530

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:53.280 
nude and I can put it on with simply
anything<00:03:51.129> and<00:03:51.519> I<00:03:52.450> like<00:03:52.659> to<00:03:52.840> wear<00:03:53.019> it<00:03:53.049> all<00:03:53.260> the

anything and I like to wear it all the

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:57.509 
anything and I like to wear it all the
time<00:03:53.549> so<00:03:55.170> because<00:03:56.170> it's<00:03:56.349> a<00:03:56.470> new<00:03:56.620> color<00:03:56.920> but<00:03:57.400> it

00:03:57.509 --> 00:03:57.519 
time so because it's a new color but it

00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:01.650 
time so because it's a new color but it
still<00:03:57.730> gives<00:03:57.879> you<00:03:58.060> some<00:03:59.549> some<00:04:00.549> pigment<00:04:01.209> and<00:04:01.360> I

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:01.660 
still gives you some some pigment and I

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:03.470 
still gives you some some pigment and I
really<00:04:01.930> like<00:04:02.140> that

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:03.480 
really like that

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:06.720 
really like that
this<00:04:04.480> one<00:04:04.720> came<00:04:04.959> dried<00:04:05.349> matte<00:04:05.650> faster<00:04:06.310> because

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:06.730 
this one came dried matte faster because

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:09.210 
this one came dried matte faster because
that<00:04:07.480> first<00:04:07.810> layer<00:04:08.079> of<00:04:08.110> chopstick<00:04:08.709> I<00:04:08.860> had<00:04:09.069> on

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:09.220 
that first layer of chopstick I had on

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:13.710 
that first layer of chopstick I had on
isn't<00:04:09.819> on<00:04:09.970> anymore<00:04:10.349> but<00:04:11.519> I'm<00:04:12.519> just<00:04:12.640> very<00:04:12.849> like

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:13.720 
isn't on anymore but I'm just very like

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:25.029 
isn't on anymore but I'm just very like
classy

00:04:25.029 --> 00:04:25.039 

00:04:25.039 --> 00:04:27.439 

okay<00:04:26.039> so<00:04:26.099> next<00:04:26.460> we're<00:04:26.699> going<00:04:26.789> to<00:04:26.849> go<00:04:27.000> into<00:04:27.330> the

00:04:27.439 --> 00:04:27.449 
okay so next we're going to go into the

00:04:27.449 --> 00:04:34.460 
okay so next we're going to go into the
berry<00:04:27.689> color

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:34.470 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:39.320 

so<00:04:35.400> this<00:04:35.610> is<00:04:35.820> zero<00:04:36.150> for<00:04:36.530> it<00:04:37.530> is<00:04:38.280> the<00:04:38.640> what<00:04:39.180> they

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:39.330 
so this is zero for it is the what they

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:43.510 
so this is zero for it is the what they
will<00:04:39.510> call<00:04:39.690> the<00:04:39.810> plumb<00:04:40.170> of<00:04:40.410> the<00:04:40.500> collection

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:43.520 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:59.430 

this<00:04:44.520> is<00:04:44.730> also<00:04:45.180> one<00:04:45.510> of<00:04:45.540> my<00:04:45.660> favorite

00:04:59.430 --> 00:04:59.440 

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:03.380 

so<00:05:00.340> it's<00:05:00.520> very<00:05:00.670> dark<00:05:01.030> I<00:05:01.420> love<00:05:02.110> dark<00:05:02.350> lipsticks

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:03.390 
so it's very dark I love dark lipsticks

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:07.200 
so it's very dark I love dark lipsticks
but<00:05:04.390> it's<00:05:04.570> um<00:05:05.580> acceptable<00:05:06.580> all<00:05:06.760> year<00:05:06.970> round

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:07.210 
but it's um acceptable all year round

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:08.700 
but it's um acceptable all year round
like<00:05:07.570> it's<00:05:07.780> not<00:05:07.930> one<00:05:08.110> of<00:05:08.140> those<00:05:08.320> colors<00:05:08.680> that

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:08.710 
like it's not one of those colors that

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:11.550 
like it's not one of those colors that
are<00:05:08.980> strictly<00:05:09.340> for<00:05:09.640> fall<00:05:09.880> so<00:05:10.450> I<00:05:10.720> really<00:05:11.350> like

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:11.560 
are strictly for fall so I really like

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:12.030 
are strictly for fall so I really like
it

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:12.040 
it

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:14.340 
it
this<00:05:12.580> one<00:05:12.850> dried<00:05:13.120> to<00:05:13.330> meThe<00:05:13.510> faster<00:05:14.020> as<00:05:14.110> well

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:14.350 
this one dried to meThe faster as well

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:19.590 
this one dried to meThe faster as well
because<00:05:15.330> my<00:05:16.330> lips<00:05:16.540> are<00:05:16.690> a<00:05:16.750> lot<00:05:16.930> more<00:05:16.960> dry<00:05:18.600> so

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:19.600 
because my lips are a lot more dry so

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:21.480 
because my lips are a lot more dry so
yes<00:05:19.840> that's<00:05:20.110> also<00:05:20.380> something<00:05:20.830> to<00:05:21.100> be<00:05:21.250> cautious

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:21.490 
yes that's also something to be cautious

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:23.790 
yes that's also something to be cautious
about<00:05:21.850> when<00:05:22.270> wearing<00:05:22.510> live<00:05:22.810> saying<00:05:23.140> they<00:05:23.590> are
