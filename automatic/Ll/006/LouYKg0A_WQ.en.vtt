00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:05.400
 beautiful all salaries are payable 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:09.240
 I 'm here today with a small blog 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:13.860
 to wish you a happy Christmas and a good one 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:15.299
 text in general we say that it was from 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:19.890
 a long time since I did a blog 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:21.960
 I think about the five six seven months then 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:28.019
 he also wanted to update mine a bit 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:29.849
 face and I didn't really want to wish you 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.730
 I also wanted a happy Christmas 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:37.710
 tell you that in the coming days 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:40.350
 during these holidays 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:43.829
 I will be little present or believe that not 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:46.680
 I will publish videos less than one that 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:49.739
 maybe already ready because I don't really have 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:53.039
 time to play read again 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:57.180
 read a lot of things and in general 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:01:02.219
 I'll do anything else I want to know some from you 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:04.170
 how you lived you are living on 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.549
 christmas anyway what will you do 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.400
 maybe a new year 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:10.560
 what did you get Santa Claus do me 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.420
 know a little eco guys I always want 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:16.229
 you know how those are always getting 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.009
 a bit of a very personal relationship 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:22.890
 with all of you 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:26.270
 I saw that the last video generated 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:29.189
 a bit of a stir a bit of 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:29.900
 left someone perplexed I think of 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:33.390
 Yes, it is 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:36.990
 let's say it was a video a little bit 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.670
 strange that of the maize nations of the world 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.909
 I wanted to bring some reflection 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.890
 so maybe even a little challenging seen 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:46.440
 also of the enemies who have seen the 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.060
 video mandate has perhaps also been a bit 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:51.090
 too heavy and saints 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:54.780
 I wanted to propose it to you ex if then you don't have 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:56.970
 understood the meaning of the video I apologize 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.940
 I will try not to be always anyway 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:01.950
 so in the next in the next videos e 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:06.500
 as for the matches instead 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.500
 I hope a stunt can work 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:13.819
 of match results as well 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:16.010
 those I proposed to you because I owe you 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:17.750
 tell the truth a little bit lately 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:22.940
 I'm playing a little what I do too 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:25.629
 general effort to recover a little 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:28.849
 no results are coming out 

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:32.180
 phenomenal and anyway I hope you like 

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:38.120
 having said the compromise is going well 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:40.880
 i want to know some guys about you here 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:49.299
 all those questions I asked him 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:51.530
 let me know and those things and don't have it 

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:56.150
 maybe but I'm not sure I will leave you one 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:58.880
 small clip to see now later maybe 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:02.630
 overlaps with rome overlaps 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:04.400
 rostov reinforced the video itself then 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:05.840
 maybe they put in a certain box 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:07.430
 dot here now I don't know yet e 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:11.239
 I hope you need it if you have already seen it 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:13.010
 the clip and nothing catches us are video 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:15.069
 happy holidays to all again and good 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:15.069
