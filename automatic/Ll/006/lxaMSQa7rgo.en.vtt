00:00:01.750 --> 00:00:05.740
 who gambled video games in the 80s 

00:00:04.149 --> 00:00:06.370
 Maybe these six gentlemen might 

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:08.830
 know 

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:11.860
 It is the first six bosses opponents of the 

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:14.139
 famous megaman we kick in the ns 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:15.119
 classics from the year 89 first against 

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:17.349
 bomb on 

00:00:15.119 --> 00:00:19.180
 contrary to the habits of that time 

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:21.430
 we can do the order in megaman 

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:23.680
 determine the levels freely and thereby 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:25.750
 a pinch of tactics comes into play right away 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:28.359
 but first, the bossgegner applies 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:30.250
 to reach at all and that is in 

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:31.779
 the mix of jump'n'run and shoot'em 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:34.270
 already an art in itself 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:36.489
 because the levels in megaman are peppered 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:37.000
 with aggressive enemies and nasty 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:39.219
 fall 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.020
 but the little blue lone fighter 

00:00:39.219 --> 00:00:42.879
 bravely plunges into adventure 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:44.860
 after all, he must save the world from the 

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:47.340
 robots of the villain dr willi 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:47.340
 bischoff 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:55.460
 if phone 8 bombs stage enters 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:57.260
 It will bomb exclusively during the bombing 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.629
 after and we keep distance and 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:01.399
 fire with our blaster that we have here 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:03.739
 and because a strike makes us 

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:05.239
 little out because megaman can be in his 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:07.520
 armor some contract 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:09.409
 but much more important is that the hero 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.310
 from home capcom also new weapons 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:12.590
 can record 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:15.050
 When we finally bomb the fuse 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:17.330
 hats we take on his attack and 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:19.549
 should with his hobbies then the level 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:23.229
 by gassmann that is namely 

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:23.229
 sensitive to exclusive 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:33.450
 before the next boss can have the 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.820
 developer but a few nasty 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.590
 Obstacles set with this hopping 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.909
 insert for example, one connects us 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.399
 heartfelt hatred 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:43.170
 because the green platforms are moving 

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:45.990
 not only but also work after 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.549
 way down what you as a record so 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.640
 looks flaky loose is one 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:51.780
 hellish challenge 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:54.960
 Of course, the last jump is the 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.549
 has longest and likes to go next time 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:01.049
 But you make it feel like 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:03.090
 a console for now comes the 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:05.580
 addressed boss tactic into the game 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.259
 we decide the duel with gassmann 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:09.780
 not with the standard weapon sun with 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:12.000
 our new bombs are against the 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:14.340
 namely robo clubs namely particularly effective 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.810
 while the hyper bomb explode 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.680
 we can dodge that 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.840
 focus 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:21.209
 after three hits, the duel is then 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.799
 decided and as well as gasman can 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:25.489
 we also rock through the 

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:25.489
 hurl territory 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.720
 the trick with the weapons change 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.900
 but is not limited to the 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:35.220
 boss fights these orange tripping hazards 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.970
 You can not use the standard weapon 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.800
 destroy 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:40.680
 instead we pick up the sounds 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.489
 from qatna with it we snip everything 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.680
 short and small 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:46.530
 From today's point of view all this sounds very 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:50.000
 simple in the year 89 is the leveldesign 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.000
 but a little revelation 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:56.060
 memorable are also the invisible ones 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:57.650
 platforms to get on here 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:00.020
 learn by heart 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:02.540
 in eight pages no one knows 

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:03.830
 Rarely also the electro blaster 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:07.040
 we now have in the repertoire 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:08.990
 can even be used in the water and 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.520
 with a special weapon the magnet 

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:12.770
 Finally, we trick the 

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:14.480
 leveldesigner out over the 

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:18.100
 we hop on platforms to jump 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:18.100
 simply own our platforms 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:22.290
 With 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:28.700
 Megaman for the ns is not a genre horror 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:30.980
 but the beginning of a gigantic 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:33.170
 A trademark alone the classic 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:35.810
 Megaman series includes ten games 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:37.610
 There are dozens of spin offs for me 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:40.250
 personally , however, is the first megaman 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:41.900
 play the best with enough ideas 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:44.090
 which make it interesting but without 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:47.950
 superfluous bells and whistles as well 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:47.950
 need to be classic video games
