00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 Findings by paying believe in it 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.759
 supporters of the quantitative movement they 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.770
 need your body in real time 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.840
 Pulse rate sleep mood 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.530
 ability to concentrate and still 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.179
 much more 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.590
 why they do that and what they do 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:14.759
 many advantages but also driven with 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.350
 could bring 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:21.810
 my name is philipp and that is one 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:23.580
 what goes on from short free translates that 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.130
 measurable i also go to two journalists 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.949
 to have back a minor by kevin kelly 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.660
 2007 the us the movement gstaad where he 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.210
 almost pretty good together what it's about 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.920
 We use pay when we use our car 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.110
 tune want chemical reaction 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.300
 analyze the outcome of elections expensive 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.170
 Say we use pay and production 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.910
 to optimize 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.620
 Why do not we pay for too 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.480
 wanting to exaggerate ourselves like ourselves 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.610
 Optimize yourself by yourself 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.140
 even evaluate enough sports done 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.480
 Do not eat too many calories 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.129
 stresslevel ok the principle itself 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.930
 First of all, to be aware of what you are 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.489
 actually is the whole day to do 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.469
 nothing unusual at first 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.000
 Everyone who wrote the diary 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.250
 or watch how much money you put into it 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.690
 month says what is meant when 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.250
 I can always see how many calories 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.990
 Not only then can I do my job 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.520
 understand at any time and if I 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.960
 I know that I write it then 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.850
 I pay more attention than I do 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.170
 just so in front of me all in it 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.119
 most of them have now 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.770
 smartphones with corresponding apps 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.720
 The data can be much easier easier 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.060
 and above all graphically 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.710
 as that was previously possible to read apps 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.659
 the quantity movements would not be 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.460
 possible and the scene is growing worldwide 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.350
 there in large cities meetup 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.729
 where like-minded people exchange views 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.799
 also in many german cities 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.479
 why you almost every step of 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.220
 of course, there are differences 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.750
 who benefits from it especially athletes 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.979
 and top athletes through a precise 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.930
 measurable training the right one 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.460
 nutrition and reasonable behavior in the 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.470
 You can do a lot more everyday 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.820
 get out of his body without language 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.439
 can ease your illness 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.970
 follow and exactly understand 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.890
 which medicine or which behavior 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.509
 they harm or benefit those who have problems 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.369
 with stress could be due to an accurate 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:56.159
 capturing everyday stress factors 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:58.170
 for example, identify exactly how short of sleep 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:59.340
 to then reduce the burden 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.570
 Of course, the data can also be used 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.460
 Control of drugs like 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.439
 cigarettes or alcohol are used 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.670
 if you see exactly how many 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:08.399
 Cigarettes you really now 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.020
 consumed weekly, or can buy 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.000
 The reduction is also easier to monitor 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.240
 become or one notices thereby only that 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.130
 times 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:15.930
 problems just because you smoke more 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:17.880
 as you think some do but 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.230
 just fun or you are curious 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.210
 find out more about yourself 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:22.890
 important seems to be self- evident to all 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:24.930
 you want to improve yourself 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.670
 not only optimize his fitness and fitness 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.890
 his weight but also his everyday life 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:30.480
 all with measurable goals 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.010
 for obese people who want to lose weight 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.960
 definitely an effective tool 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:36.300
 So what can you measure so everything 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:38.820
 simple answer for a long time 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:40.470
 answer weight pulse movement so eg 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:42.410
 how many steps one makes during the day 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.400
 sleep blood pressure mood 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:46.080
 ability to concentrate is a lot 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.480
 smartphone uses consumer water 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.840
 coffee alcohol cigarettes and much 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.820
 more 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.440
 but you really good usable 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:54.240
 You have to get data all over 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:56.250
 a longer period until again 

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:57.960
 all the diaries among you each 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:00.090
 It's pretty annoying to write something that day 

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:01.860
 in the long run or who it would be if 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:03.660
 it would automatically work and exactly 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:05.280
 Here are the so-called levels ins 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:07.290
 game technical devices the one on 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.670
 body wears it gives activity 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:10.380
 bracelets like nike hallway or 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:12.000
 Pedometer apps as well 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:13.710
 blood pressure and dare the per 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.180
 bluetooth or wlan the results 

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:16.560
 directly on the smartphone is here 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:18.510
 arises for a long time so one 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.280
 completely new market and should be in a few 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:22.500
 years already a circumference of 60 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:24.390
 billions of dollars a year have a tendency 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.860
 So getting really interesting 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:27.780
 Now if you do not just have the data 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:29.010
 but also start each other in 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:31.020
 to connect 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:32.790
 ideally one can also the smallest ones 

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:34.320
 Changes in the body makes something 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:36.150
 coffee consumption in the afternoon with my 

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:37.920
 team sleep which influence has stress 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:39.690
 on my diet as changes 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:41.190
 my mood or my concentration 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:42.720
 If I just take an hour early 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:44.310
 get up if there is no 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:46.050
 different systems then gives more 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:48.240
 maybe we can still use the app 

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:50.550
 a chocolate bar because I have a lot 

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:52.080
 did sport but could at 12 

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:53.760
 can be used for more than easy 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.900
 just to find out more about yourself and 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.220
 to improve yourself 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:57.960
 it is a great opportunity for 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:59.490
 individual medicine knows that 

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:01.170
 maybe most of the time at the doctors not so 

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:02.850
 You also get a lot of time for one 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:04.350
 just a lumpy doris of 

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:05.670
 medicines but the effect 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:07.590
 differs from human to human 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:09.120
 partly very clearly by the 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:11.040
 additional body information 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.459
 Therapy could be much more precisely tuned 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:12.959
 become 

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:14.310
 then what are a lot faster 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:16.200
 Happens as if you only went every few 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:17.730
 months with the doctor, of course, there are 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:19.140
 drove all innovations again 

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:20.940
 for one thing, most apps are and 

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:22.530
 measuring instruments are still too inaccurate 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:23.610
 really with the pretty reliable 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:25.460
 to deliver data 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:26.930
 most body fat scales eg 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:29.000
 Measure the body fat only in the legs 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:30.889
 but not on the stomach but you want to 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.419
 really know everything and who else is allowed 

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:33.949
 Except me, some know about it 

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:35.180
 health insurance companies are already using apps 

00:04:33.949 --> 00:04:37.039
 which one in health 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:39.169
 can calculate according to own up to now 

00:04:37.039 --> 00:04:40.789
 Data, of course, anonymous 

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:42.560
 These TVs too not at all 

00:04:40.789 --> 00:04:43.970
 but hearing from then on is the way not 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:45.229
 more far that the health insurance companies 

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:47.030
 really the health behavior 

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:48.860
 So you can monitor yourself 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:50.150
 Imagine being lazy for her soon 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:52.220
 insurance pay more than 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:53.660
 disciplined athletes at the latest 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:55.160
 the point the data protectors go to 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:57.470
 the barricades may be the health insurance 

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:58.789
 monitor real alcohol consumption 

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:00.740
 would also have health insurance still 

00:04:58.789 --> 00:05:02.990
 access to the data of the employers 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:04.550
 the state or your grandma what you measure 

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:05.840
 can be controlled that is 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:08.000
 good if you make yourself one 

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:09.770
 drive better behavior that is 

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.180
 bad if the data is used 

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:12.889
 to monitor someone 

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:14.509
 you can imagine that the data 

00:05:12.889 --> 00:05:16.490
 are very interesting for companies or 

00:05:14.509 --> 00:05:18.139
 secret services that try so already 

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:19.940
 monitor everything and everyone 

00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:21.770
 there is a high risk that the 

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:23.180
 Personal data will be abused 

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:25.280
 and what does actually mean better 

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:27.050
 behave who says what this good 

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:29.060
 Behavior is who sets the standard 

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:30.979
 Everything must always be reasonable 

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:31.970
 Fix the punitive reward there 

00:05:30.979 --> 00:05:33.289
 Of course it gets really fast 

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:34.880
 philosophical as I said 

00:05:33.289 --> 00:05:36.710
 health monitoring with doctors long ago 

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:39.020
 Everyday become more you learn 

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:41.300
 here and here in online there are still 

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:43.130
 march in wales and gadgets from apple i 

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:45.080
 looking forward to your opinions yourself 

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:46.310
 constantly optimizing makes that healthy or 

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:48.560
 are you the risks and side effects 

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:49.370
 Too big writes us down in the 

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:52.909
 Comments 

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:56.110
 yes and I still have 9999 steps today 

00:05:52.909 --> 00:05:56.110
 Goodbye till then bye
