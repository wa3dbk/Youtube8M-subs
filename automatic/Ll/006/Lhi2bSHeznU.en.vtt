I'm<00:00:17.450> vice<00:00:18.450> an<00:00:18.810> open<00:00:19.140> by<00:00:19.260> style

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
I'm vice an open by style

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:26.160 
I'm vice an open by style
we<00:00:20.160> hear<00:00:20.340> a<00:00:20.750> lecture<00:00:22.970> lecture<00:00:23.970> convert<00:00:24.630> imax

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:26.170 
we hear a lecture lecture convert imax

we hear a lecture lecture convert imax
I've<00:00:26.680> probably<00:00:27.130> seen<00:00:28.090> myself<00:00:28.300> as<00:00:28.630> a<00:00:28.660> project

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
I've probably seen myself as a project

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.609 
I've probably seen myself as a project
dependent<00:00:30.760> to<00:00:30.910> talk<00:00:31.119> about<00:00:31.270> it<00:00:31.540> so<00:00:31.720> I<00:00:32.080> slightly

00:00:32.609 --> 00:00:32.619 
dependent to talk about it so I slightly

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:36.960 
dependent to talk about it so I slightly
change<00:00:33.180> the<00:00:34.180> medium<00:00:34.570> approach<00:00:34.900> of<00:00:35.880> whether<00:00:36.880> a

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:36.970 
change the medium approach of whether a

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:40.979 
change the medium approach of whether a
big<00:00:37.239> performance<00:00:37.390> or<00:00:38.309> through<00:00:39.309> video<00:00:39.989> video

00:00:40.979 --> 00:00:40.989 
big performance or through video video

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:42.930 
big performance or through video video
animation<00:00:41.050> project<00:00:41.980> or<00:00:42.250> site<00:00:42.489> specifically

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:42.940 
animation project or site specifically

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:44.760 
animation project or site specifically
so<00:00:43.390> it<00:00:43.449> depends<00:00:43.750> on<00:00:43.930> the<00:00:43.989> project<00:00:44.199> the<00:00:44.559> way

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:44.770 
so it depends on the project the way

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:47.250 
so it depends on the project the way
they'll<00:00:44.980> make<00:00:45.190> the<00:00:45.340> work<00:00:45.720> if<00:00:46.720> there<00:00:46.960> was<00:00:47.230> a

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:47.260 
they'll make the work if there was a

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:51.000 
they'll make the work if there was a

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:52.720 
current ones that would be to do with

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:54.950 
current ones that would be to do with
kind<00:00:52.900> of<00:00:52.960> cultures<00:00:53.530> of<00:00:53.710> activity<00:00:54.250> that<00:00:54.280> may<00:00:54.670> be

kind of cultures of activity that may be

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.689 
kind of cultures of activity that may be
high<00:00:55.960> speed<00:00:56.260> culture<00:00:56.769> and<00:00:56.980> sort<00:00:57.640> of

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:00.010 
adrenaline culture as well I have also

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:02.579 
adrenaline culture as well I have also
had<00:01:00.940> a<00:01:01.000> really<00:01:01.720> large<00:01:02.019> stream<00:01:02.379> in<00:01:02.530> the

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:02.589 
had a really large stream in the

00:01:02.589 --> 00:01:04.649 
had a really large stream in the
practice<00:01:02.949> that<00:01:03.129> was<00:01:03.280> politically<00:01:03.879> orientated

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:04.659 
practice that was politically orientated

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:07.170 
practice that was politically orientated
and<00:01:04.870> looked<00:01:05.170> at<00:01:05.320> connecticut's<00:01:06.180> frameworks

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:07.180 
and looked at connecticut's frameworks

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:09.380 
and looked at connecticut's frameworks
and<00:01:07.659> and<00:01:08.650> all<00:01:08.890> the

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
and and all the

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.010 
and and all the

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:13.380 
in the museum
but<00:01:11.649> this<00:01:12.159> has<00:01:12.399> got<00:01:12.579> kind<00:01:12.820> of<00:01:12.850> two<00:01:13.000> parts

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:13.390 
but this has got kind of two parts

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:15.090 
but this has got kind of two parts
because<00:01:14.229> I'm<00:01:14.320> going<00:01:14.590> but<00:01:14.740> the<00:01:14.859> thing<00:01:15.070> that

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:15.100 
because I'm going but the thing that

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.450 
because I'm going but the thing that
output<00:01:15.640> this<00:01:15.729> and<00:01:15.909> the<00:01:15.969> waters<00:01:16.329> as<00:01:16.509> a<00:01:16.539> as<00:01:17.460> kind

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:18.460 
output this and the waters as a as kind

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:22.340 
output this and the waters as a as kind
of<00:01:18.549> in<00:01:18.640> a<00:01:18.700> way<00:01:18.850> a<00:01:19.179> little<00:01:20.079> bit<00:01:20.200> of<00:01:20.380> naughty<00:01:20.590> Babu

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350

what's in the gallery to video
projections<00:01:25.689> with<00:01:26.079> an<00:01:26.229> audio<00:01:26.530> component<00:01:27.130> but

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:27.340 
projections with an audio component but

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:31.699

the<00:01:27.909> performance<00:01:28.270> was<00:01:29.909> to<00:01:30.909> motorcyclist

00:01:31.699 --> 00:01:31.709 
the performance was to motorcyclist

00:01:31.709 --> 00:01:34.980 
the performance was to motorcyclist
simultaneously<00:01:32.709> lane<00:01:33.219> splitting<00:01:33.990> the

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:34.990 
simultaneously lane splitting the

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:36.209 
simultaneously lane splitting the
northern<00:01:35.350> motorway<00:01:35.500> and<00:01:35.860> gridlock<00:01:36.159> traffic

00:01:36.209 --> 00:01:36.219 
northern motorway and gridlock traffic

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:39.080 
northern motorway and gridlock traffic
and<00:01:36.850> the<00:01:36.939> idea<00:01:37.209> was<00:01:37.270> to<00:01:37.420> make<00:01:37.840> a<00:01:38.020> completely

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
and the idea was to make a completely

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.240 
and the idea was to make a completely
linear<00:01:40.090> artwork<00:01:40.840> so<00:01:41.409> the<00:01:41.649> artwork<00:01:42.039> would

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:42.250 
linear artwork so the artwork would

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:45.809 
linear artwork so the artwork would
begin<00:01:42.840> when<00:01:43.840> the<00:01:43.929> on-ramp<00:01:44.319> started<00:01:44.829> and<00:01:45.069> the

00:01:45.809 --> 00:01:45.819 
begin when the on-ramp started and the

00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:47.850 
begin when the on-ramp started and the
bikes<00:01:46.060> are<00:01:46.329> lane<00:01:46.599> splitting<00:01:46.869> or<00:01:47.170> we<00:01:47.289> call<00:01:47.739> it

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:47.860 
bikes are lane splitting or we call it

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:49.139 
bikes are lane splitting or we call it
lane<00:01:48.039> splitting<00:01:48.280> with<00:01:48.459> filtering<00:01:48.789> which<00:01:48.970> is

00:01:49.139 --> 00:01:49.149 
lane splitting with filtering which is

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:52.289 
lane splitting with filtering which is

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:08.140 
there but we anonymously suited up two

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:12.000 
there but we anonymously suited up two
riders<00:02:09.420> the<00:02:10.420> idea<00:02:10.690> beleza<00:02:11.019> which<00:02:11.290> I<00:02:11.470> mercure

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010 
riders the idea beleza which I mercure

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:14.699 
riders the idea beleza which I mercure
needs<00:02:12.310> a<00:02:12.430> bit<00:02:12.549> like<00:02:12.790> and<00:02:13.480> then<00:02:13.720> went<00:02:14.019> back<00:02:14.079> and

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709 
needs a bit like and then went back and

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:17.610 
needs a bit like and then went back and
we<00:02:15.519> taped<00:02:15.760> on<00:02:15.910> the<00:02:15.940> number<00:02:16.239> plate<00:02:16.359> and<00:02:16.720> so<00:02:17.470> that

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
we taped on the number plate and so that

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.990 
we taped on the number plate and so that
it<00:02:17.769> could<00:02:17.920> have<00:02:18.010> become<00:02:20.579> so<00:02:21.579> the<00:02:21.760> video

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
it could have become so the video

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.190 
it could have become so the video
approach<00:02:22.209> won't<00:02:22.359> have<00:02:22.510> the<00:02:22.600> number<00:02:22.810> plate<00:02:22.930> of
