00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:09.879
 so hello dear friends with you 

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:11.490
 again i'm captain adenine and today after 

00:00:09.879 --> 00:00:14.320
 big break 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:17.410
 more than a month I have not shot a video not 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:19.320
 put them on youtube and today i would 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:23.680
 wanted to do a review 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.670
 more precisely unpacking headphones from the company 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:29.020
 beats 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:31.810
 namely beats pro them I already hid the current 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:34.660
 I bought them while I was in charge. 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:36.789
 the border and of course they are already 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:38.640
 tested and can you a little 

00:00:36.789 --> 00:00:42.550
 tell what and how 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:46.329
 how do they behave and then we 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:51.489
 such is a box of black color here 

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:54.039
 headphones themselves beats sound already drawn 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:57.030
 we have drawn information how 

00:00:54.039 --> 00:00:58.149
 use this pulse and ios or 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.850
 android 

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:10.539
 How to go to the file with a function much 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:12.909
 more behind us goes we can say in 

00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:15.280
 first down on us painted like 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:16.329
 complete set this cover adapter 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:19.810
 on 6 and 3 

00:01:16.329 --> 00:01:22.990
 if I'm not mistaken millimeter and the wire itself 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:26.549
 and there are 1 headphones shown as they can 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:29.020
 be folded or 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.130
 here we have a painting on how much I 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:33.280
 I understand Dr. Dre 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:37.149
 and earphones Well let 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:40.570
 actually open the box on top 

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:43.990
 we have such a piece of paper , and so far we 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:47.890
 we remove and before us appears red 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:53.520
 box with shiny iridescent 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:58.140
 bukovka beats by here we have a magnet 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:02:01.780
 like a face open a box and 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.289
 here we have a man before him 2 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:06.009
 cleverly 

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:07.920
 the first tray and 2 we will probably start with 

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:13.090
 Kirov 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:17.940
 here we have a flypaper what are we here 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:17.940
 drink here we have two wires one 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:26.080
 wire with a microphone there microphone and so 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:28.870
 further and one wire is most likely 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:33.180
 so that you can listen to distant 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:36.850
 the distance he is without a remote without a microphone and 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:42.360
 also we have on the way out of the adapter on 6 and 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:42.360
 3 millimeters so here it is screwed 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:51.710
 and if I am not mistaken, these are such adapters 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:54.770
 more precisely the connectors are used in airplanes 

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:55.400
 and the second part is actually the most 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:03:04.880
 headphones 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:11.060
 here we have different booklets it 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:15.050
 us red bets sticker is the same 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:16.190
 we have something like instructions too 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:21.550
 instruction and 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:22.870
 color checks i bought these headphones in 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:30.350
 Italy 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:32.110
 they cost me 315 euros also here 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:37.210
 we are lying 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:42.380
 cloth with black cloth bukovkoy bets 

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:47.350
 with bay bay in the second tray 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:47.350
 we have a box 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:58.920
 in this box we cover he lies 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:04:02.200
 the touch is so similar to rubberized velor 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:05.829
 I do not know, maybe I am mistaken 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:09.670
 Such a case with written beats pro &amp; 

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:14.349
 beads by and doctor dre and proper 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:19.180
 speaking yourself headphones headphones in black 

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:23.349
 Pure black headphones as detox and 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:25.300
 worse, there was a limited version of red 

00:04:23.349 --> 00:04:28.330
 beats pro I did not buy due to the fact that 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:30.669
 they are not so cheap yet 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:35.289
 knife headphones are completely made of 

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:37.599
 aluminum is either leather or basket themselves 

00:04:35.289 --> 00:04:42.360
 earplugs weighs 

00:04:37.599 --> 00:04:42.360
 they don't keep that much on their heads 

00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:53.889
 convenient well what can i say to the other person 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:55.270
 who sits next to you of course 

00:04:53.889 --> 00:04:57.220
 if you will not turn on 

00:04:55.270 --> 00:05:00.639
 maximum volume will not be heard 

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:02.650
 what happens in headphones but if you 

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:04.990
 fly in the plane then the noise of the aircraft all 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:07.990
 equally audible but 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:11.139
 and noise is something like archery street or 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:17.009
 subway noise i think it will save 

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:20.009
 but for the same let's see how it looks like 

00:05:17.009 --> 00:05:20.009
 little fingers 

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:26.240
 also these headphones most likely 

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:30.040
 practically not killed as made 

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:34.100
 from aluminum so here they are folded 

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:36.290
 Cheholchik special for a cup and so 

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:40.850
 Here they look pretty 

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:47.810
 still compact and also looks good 

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:48.800
 okay so what's up with that probably I would 

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:52.070
 wanted to finish 

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:57.100
 brief unpacking of headphone beats 

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:59.360
 buy Dr. Dre beats pro in black 

00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:02.770
 I want to say that it is very good 

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:07.640
 headphones I would advise everyone to take 

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:10.840
 I do not know there is also a killer studio mixer 

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:13.390
 and so on, but I took the pro as in them 

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:16.930
 interlocutor who sits next to you 

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:20.210
 hardly hear what you are listening to 

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:22.640
 thank you all with you was captain daniel 

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:25.840
