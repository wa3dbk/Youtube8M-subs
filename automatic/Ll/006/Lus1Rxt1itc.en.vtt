00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:08.010
 o into national institute of 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.450
 traumatology and orthopedics has just 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.000
 start a search that can 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.920
 revolutionize the treatment of tumors 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.410
 malignant bones 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.150
 the study is done using cells 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.580
 tumor trunk 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.580
 the research aims to benefit 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:26.640
 patients with a diagnosis of oz and 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.590
 sarcoma a malignant bone tumor that 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.320
 affects people in the growth phase 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.420
 especially children and young people 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.329
 10 and 20 years 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.870
 in general the child the young people report a 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:41.840
 pain in a large joint 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:45.440
 knee joint is a joint 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:48.480
 preferential for this type of injury and 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:50.430
 people to be attentive to those 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.070
 growth that takes place in a 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.980
 very fast then we know that the 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:58.770
 malignant tumors they have a 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:00.629
 direct the prognosis of these tumors have 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.000
 a direct relationship with the moment 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.189
 they are then diagnosed in other 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.390
 words is the prognosis is very 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:11.880
 related to the early diagnosis of 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.740
 The major problem of the disease is that 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.090
 a small part of the cells that 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.850
 make up the tumor 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:20.369
 about 1% is made up of stem cells 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.780
 tumor cells that are responsible for 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.720
 cell renewal 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:27.900
 in other words they help the tumor 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.040
 increase and possibly proliferate 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.850
 by the body 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:34.310
 the main objective of the research is 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:36.900
 to correlate is to try to 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:39.299
 establish a correlation between the 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:42.960
 number of stem cells present in a 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:47.100
 determined has taken and how is the 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:48.810
 response to treatment is that tumor 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.509
 the study is made from the isolation 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:54.180
 and multiplication of the stem cells of the 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:56.189
 two-stage tumor in the first 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.619
 time of the biopsy or when it is 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:01.140
 removed the tumor from the patient to the 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:03.659
 diagnosis and the second after treatment 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.670
 done with chemotherapy that goes 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:07.320
 allow the identification of the 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.509
 number of cells 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.790
 the aggressiveness of the tumor and the degree of 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.860
 it is the treatment resistance from 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:16.020
 the 1970s the treatment of 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.630
 morrored if the effect in the same way 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:22.920
 through chemotherapy and surgeries 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:25.200
 I am regenerating amputation in 27% of 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:28.500
 cases it is necessary to withdraw the 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:30.720
 committed and the other cases are 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:33.240
 surgery for removal of part of the 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:35.970
 and a prosthesis or 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:38.130
 to replace the joint 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:40.500
 even so, the mortality rate 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:43.950
 it is still very high 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:46.440
 It is estimated that in 75% of 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.930
 patient dies within five years of 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:52.130
 evolution of the disease what we want is 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:56.010
 establish a profile for each patient 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:57.630
 of expressing this they trunk and try 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:02.010
 relate this to the response of this 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:04.430
 patient to chemotherapy is to try 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:07.590
 avoid in the future is amputations 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:10.410
 unnecessary, ie patients who 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:12.630
 many stem cells would be 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:15.330
 more resistant to chemotherapy and 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:17.850
 therefore they would be the tumor that 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:18.870
 would be faster and therefore would be 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:22.320
 hidden 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:24.330
 So that 's our question , according to 

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:27.200
 with information from the university of sÃ£o 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:30.450
 paulo estimates that if they are diagnosed 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:34.250
 350 cases of bone tumor per year in 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:34.250
 people under 20 years of age
