00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:37.330 
the easiest way to get that infamous
triangle<00:01:35.570> head<00:01:35.720> the<00:01:36.350> reason<00:01:36.650> a<00:01:36.740> triangle<00:01:37.190> head

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:37.340 
triangle head the reason a triangle head

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.400 
triangle head the reason a triangle head
is<00:01:37.490> formed<00:01:37.970> is<00:01:38.090> because<00:01:38.600> there<00:01:38.780> is<00:01:38.810> no<00:01:38.930> layers

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:39.410 
is formed is because there is no layers

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:40.930 
is formed is because there is no layers
and<00:01:39.740> because<00:01:40.130> there's<00:01:40.280> no<00:01:40.370> layer<00:01:40.610> there's<00:01:40.880> a

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:40.940 
and because there's no layer there's a

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:42.640 
and because there's no layer there's a
lot<00:01:41.180> of<00:01:41.300> weight<00:01:41.510> being<00:01:41.750> put<00:01:42.020> on<00:01:42.140> the<00:01:42.290> roots

with<00:01:56.540> high<00:01:56.930> layers<00:01:57.320> as<00:01:57.620> you<00:01:57.890> can<00:01:58.160> see<00:01:58.310> her

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:58.520 
with high layers as you can see her

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.370 
with high layers as you can see her
layers<00:01:58.760> start<00:01:59.150> right<00:01:59.300> about<00:01:59.540> here<00:01:59.900> getting

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:00.380 
layers start right about here getting

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:02.470 
layers start right about here getting
high<00:02:00.590> layers<00:02:00.920> is<00:02:01.220> the<00:02:01.370> fastest<00:02:01.910> way<00:02:02.060> to<00:02:02.090> get<00:02:02.420> a

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:02.480 
high layers is the fastest way to get a

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:04.300 
high layers is the fastest way to get a
buttload<00:02:03.020> of<00:02:03.290> volume<00:02:03.740> and<00:02:03.920> curl<00:02:04.070> definition

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.310 
buttload of volume and curl definition

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.310 
buttload of volume and curl definition
so<00:02:05.270> if<00:02:05.390> you<00:02:05.510> have<00:02:05.630> long<00:02:05.810> hair<00:02:05.840> and<00:02:06.230> you're

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:06.320 
so if you have long hair and you're

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.080 
so if you have long hair and you're
looking<00:02:06.590> for<00:02:06.770> a<00:02:06.800> way<00:02:06.890> to<00:02:06.920> get<00:02:07.220> more<00:02:07.430> volume<00:02:07.760> and

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090 
looking for a way to get more volume and

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:09.980 
looking for a way to get more volume and
curl<00:02:08.179> definition<00:02:08.590> definitely<00:02:09.590> look

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:09.990 
curl definition definitely look

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:12.470 
curl definition definitely look
to<00:02:10.140> getting<00:02:10.500> higher<00:02:10.770> layers<00:02:11.040> but<00:02:11.640> be<00:02:12.090> careful

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
to getting higher layers but be careful

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.880 
to getting higher layers but be careful
because<00:02:12.600> you<00:02:12.720> might<00:02:13.200> end<00:02:13.470> up<00:02:13.590> with<00:02:13.740> an

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
because you might end up with an

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.860 
because you might end up with an
accidental<00:02:14.550> bullet<00:02:14.730> depending<00:02:15.360> on<00:02:15.480> your<00:02:15.570> curl

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
accidental bullet depending on your curl

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.340 
accidental bullet depending on your curl
type<00:02:16.080> and<00:02:16.350> the<00:02:16.860> hairstylist<00:02:17.700> and<00:02:18.270> next<00:02:18.810> is<00:02:18.960> me

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
type and the hairstylist and next is me

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:21.740 
type and the hairstylist and next is me
I<00:02:19.830> actually<00:02:20.130> have<00:02:20.550> long<00:02:20.850> hair<00:02:21.090> with<00:02:21.300> low

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
I actually have long hair with low

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.630 
I actually have long hair with low
layers<00:02:22.050> as<00:02:22.320> you<00:02:22.380> can<00:02:22.680> see<00:02:22.830> my<00:02:23.070> layers<00:02:23.340> are

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
layers as you can see my layers are

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.730 
layers as you can see my layers are
really<00:02:23.670> low<00:02:24.300> they<00:02:24.480> start<00:02:24.750> right<00:02:24.930> about<00:02:25.050> here

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:25.740 
really low they start right about here

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:28.160 
really low they start right about here
having<00:02:26.220> low<00:02:26.400> layers<00:02:26.700> pulls<00:02:27.360> down<00:02:27.600> my<00:02:27.810> curls

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
having low layers pulls down my curls

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.410 
having low layers pulls down my curls
controlling<00:02:29.010> them<00:02:29.250> and<00:02:29.280> taking<00:02:29.820> away<00:02:29.940> volume

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
controlling them and taking away volume

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.240 
controlling them and taking away volume
and<00:02:30.600> a<00:02:30.660> little<00:02:30.900> bit<00:02:31.020> of<00:02:31.110> definition<00:02:31.260> but

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
and a little bit of definition but

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.090 
and a little bit of definition but
having<00:02:32.970> the<00:02:33.210> layers<00:02:33.420> also<00:02:33.870> gives<00:02:34.140> me<00:02:34.470> some

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
having the layers also gives me some

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.280 
having the layers also gives me some
volume<00:02:35.370> so<00:02:35.970> if<00:02:36.150> you<00:02:36.300> have<00:02:36.480> high<00:02:36.690> layers<00:02:36.990> just

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
volume so if you have high layers just

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.020 
volume so if you have high layers just
continue<00:02:37.890> growing<00:02:38.130> out<00:02:38.340> your<00:02:38.370> hair<00:02:38.520> until

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
continue growing out your hair until

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:40.880 
continue growing out your hair until
they<00:02:39.150> become<00:02:39.420> low<00:02:39.660> layers<00:02:39.930> and<00:02:40.320> if<00:02:40.470> you<00:02:40.590> have

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
they become low layers and if you have

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:42.590 
they become low layers and if you have
here<00:02:41.160> that's<00:02:41.340> one<00:02:41.490> length<00:02:41.700> and<00:02:41.970> just<00:02:42.150> get<00:02:42.330> low

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
here that's one length and just get low

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.020 
here that's one length and just get low
layers<00:02:42.810> the<00:02:43.320> last<00:02:43.620> haircut<00:02:44.220> is<00:02:44.460> not<00:02:44.490> really<00:02:45.000> a

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
layers the last haircut is not really a

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.780 
layers the last haircut is not really a
haircut<00:02:45.630> at<00:02:45.810> all<00:02:45.930> actually<00:02:46.230> it's<00:02:46.770> having<00:02:47.520> hair

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
haircut at all actually it's having hair

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:49.550 
haircut at all actually it's having hair
that<00:02:48.000> is<00:02:48.120> all<00:02:48.330> one<00:02:48.570> length<00:02:48.810> as<00:02:49.050> you<00:02:49.200> can<00:02:49.350> tell

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
that is all one length as you can tell

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.950 
that is all one length as you can tell
she<00:02:49.800> has<00:02:49.830> absolutely<00:02:50.160> no<00:02:50.580> layers<00:02:51.240> anywhere

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:51.960 
she has absolutely no layers anywhere

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:53.870 
she has absolutely no layers anywhere
having<00:02:52.440> long<00:02:52.620> hair<00:02:52.650> with<00:02:53.010> no<00:02:53.040> layers<00:02:53.400> is

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
having long hair with no layers is

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.430 
having long hair with no layers is
probably<00:02:54.330> the<00:02:54.480> best<00:02:54.690> way<00:02:54.870> to<00:02:54.900> get<00:02:55.260> rid<00:02:55.410> of

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
probably the best way to get rid of

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.110 
probably the best way to get rid of
volume<00:02:55.890> and<00:02:56.040> curl<00:02:56.220> definition<00:02:56.430> because

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
volume and curl definition because

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.210 
volume and curl definition because
there's<00:02:57.330> just<00:02:57.570> going<00:02:57.660> to<00:02:57.720> be<00:02:57.780> so<00:02:58.320> much<00:02:58.710> weight

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
there's just going to be so much weight

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.220 
there's just going to be so much weight
on<00:02:59.490> your<00:02:59.790> roots<00:03:00.060> and<00:03:00.390> on<00:03:00.570> your<00:03:00.720> curls<00:03:01.080> that

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
they're going to loosen up and you'll

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.310 
they're going to loosen up and you'll
lose<00:03:02.850> volume<00:03:03.060> so<00:03:03.480> if<00:03:03.630> you're<00:03:03.840> looking<00:03:04.110> for<00:03:04.290> a
