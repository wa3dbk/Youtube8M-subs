using<00:00:28.050> a<00:00:28.320> zigzag<00:00:28.920> pattern<00:00:29.609> because<00:00:30.269> it's

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
using a zigzag pattern because it's

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.590 
using a zigzag pattern because it's
going<00:00:31.199> to<00:00:31.289> make<00:00:31.560> our<00:00:31.769> waves<00:00:32.399> look<00:00:32.880> softer<00:00:33.390> once

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
we put it all down so there we have it

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.729 
we put it all down so there we have it
then<00:00:35.790> I<00:00:35.820> am<00:00:35.940> going<00:00:36.270> to<00:00:36.360> brush<00:00:36.719> all<00:00:36.989> of<00:00:37.020> my<00:00:37.380> hair

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
up and over the top of the other strand

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.300 
up and over the top of the other strand
what<00:01:45.270> this<00:01:45.450> is<00:01:45.630> going<00:01:45.990> to<00:01:46.170> do<00:01:46.409> is<00:01:46.710> it<00:01:46.950> is<00:01:46.979> going

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
what this is going to do is it is going

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.960 
what this is going to do is it is going
to<00:01:47.579> create<00:01:47.970> the<00:01:48.360> rope<00:01:48.630> braid<00:01:49.049> and<00:01:49.610> the<00:01:50.610> reason

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
to create the rope braid and the reason

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.399 
to create the rope braid and the reason
why<00:01:51.090> we're<00:01:51.240> doing<00:01:51.270> that<00:01:51.630> is<00:01:51.780> because<00:01:51.810> we<00:01:52.200> want

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
why we're doing that is because we want

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.190 
why we're doing that is because we want
our<00:01:52.619> waves<00:01:52.920> to<00:01:53.490> be<00:01:54.299> in<00:01:54.450> that<00:01:54.630> pattern<00:01:54.869> of<00:01:55.110> the

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
our waves to be in that pattern of the

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.359 
our waves to be in that pattern of the
rope<00:01:55.320> braid<00:01:55.500> we<00:01:55.590> don't<00:01:55.740> want<00:01:55.890> it<00:01:55.979> just<00:01:56.009> to<00:01:56.219> be

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
rope braid we don't want it just to be

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.209 
rope braid we don't want it just to be
twisted<00:01:56.820> back<00:01:57.060> and<00:01:57.390> flat<00:01:57.719> and<00:01:57.960> weird<00:01:58.320> so<00:01:58.979> this

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
twisted back and flat and weird so this

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.399 
twisted back and flat and weird so this
is<00:01:59.399> going<00:01:59.670> to<00:01:59.790> help<00:01:59.939> create<00:02:00.450> better<00:02:00.479> waves<00:02:01.110> at

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
is going to help create better waves at

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.410 
is going to help create better waves at
our<00:02:01.680> end<00:02:01.890> result<00:02:02.430> so<00:02:02.880> I'm<00:02:02.969> just<00:02:03.149> going<00:02:03.360> to

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
our end result so I'm just going to

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.959 
our end result so I'm just going to
continue<00:02:03.659> to<00:02:03.960> keep<00:02:04.290> doing<00:02:04.590> this<00:02:04.710> method<00:02:04.969> and

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
continue to keep doing this method and

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:55.610 
going to create the perfect wave once we

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:57.610 
going to create the perfect wave once we
take<00:02:55.790> it<00:02:55.910> down<00:02:56.060> so<00:02:56.660> I'm<00:02:56.750> just<00:02:56.900> going<00:02:57.110> to<00:02:57.200> place

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
take it down so I'm just going to place

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:59.560 
take it down so I'm just going to place
this<00:02:57.830> over<00:02:58.160> the<00:02:58.280> top<00:02:58.430> of<00:02:58.460> my<00:02:58.700> head<00:02:58.880> and<00:02:59.090> using<00:02:59.330> a

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
few claw clips to keep it in place and

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:04.300

then I'm going to bobby pin my ends to

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:07.540 
then I'm going to bobby pin my ends to
make<00:03:04.520> sure<00:03:04.700> that<00:03:04.910> they<00:03:05.060> stay<00:03:05.290> secure<00:03:06.290> this<00:03:07.220> way

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:07.550 
make sure that they stay secure this way

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:09.640 
make sure that they stay secure this way
it<00:03:07.940> just<00:03:07.970> makes<00:03:08.450> sure<00:03:08.570> that<00:03:08.690> we<00:03:08.990> can<00:03:09.140> keep<00:03:09.440> all

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.650

it just makes sure that we can keep all
of<00:03:09.680> our<00:03:09.860> twists<00:03:10.340> up<00:03:10.610> and<00:03:11.270> out<00:03:11.510> of<00:03:11.660> our<00:03:11.840> way

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:12.110 
of our twists up and out of our way

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:13.750

bit of heat on your hair and the rest of
it<00:05:21.440> is<00:05:21.620> all<00:05:21.920> just<00:05:22.310> natural<00:05:23.150> and<00:05:23.450> then<00:05:24.050> when<00:05:24.230> you

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:24.410 
it is all just natural and then when you

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:26.410 
it is all just natural and then when you
have<00:05:24.590> done<00:05:24.620> everything<00:05:25.490> else<00:05:25.610> just<00:05:26.150> set<00:05:26.330> it

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:26.420 
have done everything else just set it

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:28.750 
have done everything else just set it
with<00:05:26.510> a<00:05:26.540> little<00:05:26.720> bit<00:05:26.870> of<00:05:26.960> hairspray<00:05:27.170> I<00:05:27.740> like<00:05:28.610> to

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:28.760 
with a little bit of hairspray I like to

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:30.370 
with a little bit of hairspray I like to
use<00:05:28.910> one<00:05:29.120> that<00:05:29.270> has<00:05:29.420> kind<00:05:29.630> of<00:05:29.750> like<00:05:29.870> a<00:05:29.960> humidity

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:30.380 
use one that has kind of like a humidity

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:32.350 
use one that has kind of like a humidity
resistant<00:05:31.040> because<00:05:31.160> this<00:05:31.430> is<00:05:31.610> kind<00:05:32.030> of<00:05:32.120> more

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:32.360 
resistant because this is kind of more

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:34.420 
resistant because this is kind of more
of<00:05:32.480> a<00:05:32.570> natural<00:05:32.600> look<00:05:33.470> it<00:05:33.650> can<00:05:33.830> get<00:05:34.010> a<00:05:34.040> little

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:34.430 
of a natural look it can get a little

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:37.750 
of a natural look it can get a little
bit<00:05:34.610> more<00:05:34.790> frizzy<00:05:35.980> so<00:05:36.980> this<00:05:37.160> just<00:05:37.400> helps<00:05:37.520> to

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:37.760 
bit more frizzy so this just helps to

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:40.330 
bit more frizzy so this just helps to
set<00:05:38.000> everything<00:05:38.180> in<00:05:38.960> place<00:05:39.020> and<00:05:39.710> then<00:05:40.130> once

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:40.340
