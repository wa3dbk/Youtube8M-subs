experience<00:00:18.099> for<00:00:18.640> us<00:00:18.970> I<00:00:19.240> think<00:00:19.810> we're<00:00:19.930> gonna

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:20.020 
experience for us I think we're gonna

experience for us I think we're gonna
take<00:00:20.140> a<00:00:20.200> lot<00:00:20.350> of<00:00:20.380> good<00:00:20.590> things<00:00:20.800> out<00:00:21.100> of<00:00:21.250> it<00:00:21.449> it's

never<00:00:22.600> fun<00:00:22.930> to<00:00:22.960> lose<00:00:23.320> but<00:00:23.800> I<00:00:23.859> think<00:00:24.130> you<00:00:24.220> learn

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:24.369 
never fun to lose but I think you learn

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:26.370 
never fun to lose but I think you learn
a<00:00:24.430> lot<00:00:24.640> from<00:00:24.699> it<00:00:25.060> so<00:00:25.269> we'll<00:00:25.750> see<00:00:25.960> how<00:00:25.990> much<00:00:26.230> we

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:26.380 
a lot from it so we'll see how much we

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:28.679 
a lot from it so we'll see how much we
learn<00:00:26.560> from<00:00:26.590> it<00:00:26.890> as<00:00:27.099> the<00:00:27.250> season<00:00:27.609> goes<00:00:27.789> I<00:00:28.180> don't

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:28.689 
learn from it as the season goes I don't

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:31.439 
learn from it as the season goes I don't
think<00:00:28.750> you<00:00:28.900> ever<00:00:28.930> really<00:00:29.140> know<00:00:29.529> until<00:00:30.300> you<00:00:31.300> get

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:31.449 
think you ever really know until you get

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:32.759 
think you ever really know until you get
to<00:00:31.570> the<00:00:31.599> end<00:00:31.720> of<00:00:31.869> the<00:00:31.929> season<00:00:32.080> see<00:00:32.470> how<00:00:32.619> much

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:32.769 
to the end of the season see how much

00:00:32.769 --> 00:00:34.650 
to the end of the season see how much
you<00:00:32.920> improve<00:00:33.250> from<00:00:33.460> from<00:00:33.910> losses<00:00:34.330> but<00:00:34.449> I<00:00:34.510> mean

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:34.660 
you improve from from losses but I mean

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:36.329 
you improve from from losses but I mean
we<00:00:34.780> learn<00:00:34.960> a<00:00:34.989> lot<00:00:35.170> when<00:00:35.230> we<00:00:35.410> went<00:00:35.680> to<00:00:35.769> something

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:36.339 
we learn a lot when we went to something

00:00:36.339 --> 00:00:39.450 
we learn a lot when we went to something
kept<00:00:36.549> have<00:00:36.699> a<00:00:36.729> loss<00:00:37.000> to<00:00:37.360> to<00:00:38.110> learn<00:00:38.500> I<00:00:38.920> mean<00:00:39.220> last

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:39.460 
kept have a loss to to learn I mean last

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:40.890 
kept have a loss to to learn I mean last
week<00:00:39.640> when<00:00:39.879> Russell<00:00:40.180> Pittsburgh<00:00:40.600> I<00:00:40.720> think

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:40.900 
week when Russell Pittsburgh I think

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:42.570 
week when Russell Pittsburgh I think
there's<00:00:41.049> a<00:00:41.140> lot<00:00:41.260> of<00:00:41.320> learning<00:00:41.739> things<00:00:42.460> from

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:42.580 
there's a lot of learning things from

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:44.250 
there's a lot of learning things from
that<00:00:42.850> as<00:00:43.000> well<00:00:43.239> even<00:00:43.720> though<00:00:43.809> we<00:00:43.960> won<00:00:44.140> the

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:44.260 
that as well even though we won the

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:45.420 
that as well even though we won the
match<00:00:44.440> so<00:00:44.769> I<00:00:44.799> don't<00:00:45.010> think<00:00:45.159> you<00:00:45.309> necessarily

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:45.430 
match so I don't think you necessarily

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:48.180 
match so I don't think you necessarily
have<00:00:45.729> to<00:00:45.820> lose<00:00:46.120> to<00:00:46.449> learn<00:00:46.720> but<00:00:47.049> some<00:00:47.949> things

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:48.190 
have to lose to learn but some things

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:50.579 
have to lose to learn but some things
became<00:00:48.610> evident<00:00:49.030> to<00:00:49.510> us<00:00:49.540> that<00:00:49.690> we<00:00:50.409> need<00:00:50.559> to

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:50.589 
became evident to us that we need to

00:00:50.589 --> 00:00:52.530 
became evident to us that we need to
work<00:00:50.769> out<00:00:50.860> and<00:00:51.129> as<00:00:51.580> a<00:00:51.610> team<00:00:51.909> going<00:00:52.299> to<00:00:52.390> bounce

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:29.110

motivation<00:01:29.530> in<00:01:29.920> the<00:01:30.010> training<00:01:30.220> room<00:01:30.400> this

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:30.580 
motivation in the training room this

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:32.340 
motivation in the training room this
weekend<00:01:31.030> leading<00:01:31.150> up<00:01:31.360> to<00:01:31.480> this<00:01:31.570> weekend<00:01:31.930> after

weekend leading up to this weekend after

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:34.740 
weekend leading up to this weekend after
Iowa<00:01:32.800> I<00:01:32.980> don't<00:01:33.820> think<00:01:33.880> we<00:01:34.120> needed<00:01:34.360> that<00:01:34.480> to

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:34.750 
Iowa I don't think we needed that to

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:36.180

motivate<00:01:34.900> our<00:01:35.140> guys<00:01:35.409> I<00:01:35.650> think<00:01:35.860> they're<00:01:36.010> pretty

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:36.190 
motivate our guys I think they're pretty

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:40.410 
motivate our guys I think they're pretty
motivated<00:01:36.850> guys<00:01:38.040> again<00:01:39.040> it's<00:01:39.310> just<00:01:39.580> how<00:01:40.360> do

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:40.420 
motivated guys again it's just how do

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:41.880

you<00:01:40.570> respond<00:01:40.990> to<00:01:41.080> something<00:01:41.320> like<00:01:41.409> this<00:01:41.500> you

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:41.890 
you respond to something like this you

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:44.010 
you respond to something like this you
just<00:01:42.040> keep<00:01:42.250> improving<00:01:42.640> but<00:01:42.940> again<00:01:43.750> I<00:01:43.780> don't

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:46.600 
think they necessarily needed a lost to

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.240 
think they necessarily needed a lost to
be<00:01:46.720> motivated<00:01:47.260> to<00:01:47.290> work<00:01:47.500> harder<00:01:47.530> guys<00:01:47.979> work
