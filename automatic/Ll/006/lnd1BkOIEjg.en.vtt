00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.899
 dose of euros so this one I 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.350
 know especially not too much 

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:26.939
 it's wario blast featuring bomberman 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:28.679

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:31.920

00:01:28.679 --> 00:01:35.670

 two-euro game is bomberman quest 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:41.490
 a little rpg is really simple it's 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.700
 cool for 2 euros each 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:47.219

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.280
