 quails and chickens mean what is equipped 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:09.320
 broder bruder 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:12.620
 equipped with infrared lamp controls 

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:17.070
 means that you can regulate heat 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:17.910
 more less why infrared lamp 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.220
 right away 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.920
 saving goes electricity if you do 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.580
 warm floor and + lights it in order 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.830
 saving 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.510
 iashta him for this was used 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.359
 just one infrared lamp in 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.550
 the quality of heating and there is a backlight 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:35.460
 such a regulator on the lower tier and on 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.620
 top tier means in this case two 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.379
 tier top tier as you see the same 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:45.590
 there is a bird 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:45.590
 binding here 10 days they already 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:52.440
 quail 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:54.510
 drink waterless glasses drink with 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.840
 bunker trough then we show how 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:00.629
 feeder made it will be so 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:03.300
 talk teenage room also have 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:10.650
 they have a creche what is 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:13.619
 nursery means if we have a door almost 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:18.380
 completely covered with us cloth why 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:21.390
 the tissues that the bird could breathe we have 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:27.869
 litter tray 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:30.750
 and also there is a pallet mesh floor 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:34.700
 the manger is currently laid 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.700
 rag now we are all water for now and 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:42.750
 means 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:44.909
 in a manger up to 10 days it means sex like me 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.340
 ruled a neatly made cloth 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.990
 so that there is no scuffing gap 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.320
 because the little bird will be there 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:56.210
 climb and hide the first 10 days 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:02:01.049
 we put a vacuum feeder for food and 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:03.810
 water vacuum drinker that 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:08.819
 there is still then when the bird has grown a little 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:10.910
 do it all take and use 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:14.250
 Dusty Dusty Dusty Dusty 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:18.959
 done know how on flex 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:22.500
 hose slide guides well to 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:23.819
 drinking bowl did not walk left and right and with the help 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:29.370
 lightly 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:37.110
 lowered lowered as 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:39.140
 ascending birds and whether the municipality 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:41.150
 as the bird grows , it's all business 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:44.160
 rises 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:46.560
 depending on how much you are going to manger 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:48.510
 keep the bird or this chick or this 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:53.070
 you drank it all depends on who you are 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:55.290
 then put here when we already 

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:58.980
 the bird has grown a little bit under us 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:02.850
 pick up feeders vacuum and rear 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:04.560
 stenochku we have a bunker the bunker is the same 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:06.359
 when the little bird gets a little older with us 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:09.200
 the fish feeds that the bird is not there 

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:11.910
 I climbed and did not bathe in the stern 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:15.690
 so the birdie is ok 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:17.910
 I feel a thermometer for temperature 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:19.829
 see how many birds we do 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:21.959
 temperature and accordingly 

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:25.010
 infrared lamp infrared lamp 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:29.400
 that it was better seen so take poilochku 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:30.900
 goes mirror base why is she not 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.000
 dissipates all the heat 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:35.639
 she just gives warmth to that direction 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.940
 where the beam hits everything here with this that we 

00:03:35.639 --> 00:03:42.569
 we win we win that 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:45.209
 or chickens or quail as they have 

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:47.549
 this half is all warm 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:49.870
 hence, accordingly, this half is 

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:53.489
 they have a cold instead of a cool room 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:59.739
 This is how a kindergarten looks 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:04:03.430
 Means bunker feeding and even forgot 

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:04.450
 say if anyone has a lot of birds and that means 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:07.090
 that's all here 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:10.060
 lightly on stationery buttons 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:12.069
 removed and get the usual option 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:15.159
 that's how we have teen top 

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:20.109
 room you can keep it methane and bird 

00:04:15.159 --> 00:04:22.020
 from 1 day to age and the transfer shaft 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:28.389
 adult cells 

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:31.300
 Means regulators ordinary dimmers on 

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:34.120
 light tower which are regulated easily 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:37.870
 due to this we keep the temperature and 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:40.210
 highlighting means we also have 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:41.220
 Poilochka on poilochku used 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:44.020
 ordinary bucket 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:46.960
 flexible hose why are flexible so you can 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:51.520
 it was easy to adjust the feed height 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:54.720
 drinkers nipple threesome and flow 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:59.229
 went top upper row and outer 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:05:03.310
 then we have rudra buffer 

00:04:59.229 --> 00:05:05.530
 lid fall asleep food and a couple of days 

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:09.270
 the bird is rather trying to eat 

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:09.270
 constantly do not touch them do not disturb 

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:21.250
 dimensions really mean if anyone 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:24.490
 interested meter fifty and 40 in such 

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:26.620
 brooders can contain up to 60 birds 

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:29.830
 dependencies there are publishers diapers of the soul 

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:32.410
 flowers if this chicken means less in 

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:34.720
 This moment here these calves 10 days 

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:37.090
 they already have a fully open door 

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:41.729
 rags filling them already calmly 

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:43.889
 feed with bunker feeders in principle 

00:05:41.729 --> 00:05:46.330
 I wish you all good luck 

00:05:43.889 --> 00:05:49.710
 work to show and we will watch 

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:49.710
 learn from you all
