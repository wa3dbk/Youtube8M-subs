00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
the difference immediately when I

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.170 
the difference immediately when I
demonstrate<00:00:34.350> this<00:00:34.380> and<00:00:34.860> I<00:00:35.250> just<00:00:35.700> like<00:00:35.850> to<00:00:36.000> tell

demonstrate this and I just like to tell
you<00:00:36.329> some<00:00:36.600> of<00:00:36.630> the<00:00:36.780> problems<00:00:37.110> using<00:00:37.770> red<00:00:37.980> oak

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
you some of the problems using red oak

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.209 
you some of the problems using red oak
in<00:00:38.370> bulwark<00:00:39.270> it<00:00:39.600> soaks<00:00:40.200> up<00:00:40.410> a<00:00:40.559> tremendous

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
in bulwark it soaks up a tremendous

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.569 
in bulwark it soaks up a tremendous
amount<00:00:41.550> of<00:00:41.670> water<00:00:41.879> because<00:00:42.329> it's<00:00:42.540> very<00:00:42.780> porous

00:00:43.569 --> 00:00:43.579 
amount of water because it's very porous

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:46.190 
amount of water because it's very porous
between<00:00:44.579> the<00:00:44.760> annual<00:00:45.239> rings<00:00:45.450> between<00:00:46.050> the

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
between the annual rings between the

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.680 
between the annual rings between the
growth<00:00:46.440> rings<00:00:46.829> the<00:00:47.430> porosity<00:00:47.820> is<00:00:48.239> actually

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
growth rings the porosity is actually

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.410 
growth rings the porosity is actually
continuous<00:00:49.559> like<00:00:49.800> straws<00:00:50.280> from<00:00:50.730> one<00:00:51.030> end<00:00:51.329> of

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
continuous like straws from one end of

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.450 
continuous like straws from one end of
the<00:00:51.570> tree<00:00:51.780> to<00:00:51.989> the<00:00:52.050> other<00:00:52.170> so<00:00:52.860> it<00:00:52.949> soaks<00:00:53.219> up

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
the tree to the other so it soaks up

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.750 
the tree to the other so it soaks up
water<00:00:53.520> very<00:00:54.300> very<00:00:54.719> fast<00:00:55.170> and<00:00:55.500> large<00:00:56.100> volumes

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
water very very fast and large volumes

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.930 
water very very fast and large volumes
of<00:00:56.940> water<00:00:57.149> so<00:00:57.930> in<00:00:58.500> a<00:00:58.739> boat<00:00:58.949> it<00:00:59.219> can<00:00:59.340> soak<00:00:59.550> fresh

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
of water so in a boat it can soak fresh

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.880 
of water so in a boat it can soak fresh
water<00:01:00.239> in<00:01:00.480> from<00:01:00.719> the<00:01:00.840> top<00:01:01.020> and<00:01:01.289> create<00:01:01.440> fresh

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
water in from the top and create fresh

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.820 
water in from the top and create fresh
water<00:01:02.160> rot<00:01:02.489> or<00:01:02.699> a<00:01:02.760> concrete<00:01:03.329> so<00:01:03.930> saltwater<00:01:04.530> in

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
water rot or a concrete so saltwater in

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.950 
water rot or a concrete so saltwater in
from<00:01:05.040> the<00:01:05.159> bottom<00:01:05.549> now<00:01:06.270> with<00:01:06.510> the<00:01:06.630> induction

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
from the bottom now with the induction

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.719 
from the bottom now with the induction
of<00:01:07.320> DC<00:01:07.770> current<00:01:08.070> into<00:01:08.939> the<00:01:09.090> salt<00:01:09.540> water<00:01:10.340> it<00:01:11.340> can

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
of DC current into the salt water it can

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.160 
of DC current into the salt water it can
break<00:01:11.939> down<00:01:12.150> the<00:01:12.390> salt<00:01:12.630> and<00:01:12.810> that<00:01:12.900> causes

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
break down the salt and that causes

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.230 
break down the salt and that causes
tremendous<00:01:13.500> problems<00:01:14.340> of<00:01:14.520> the<00:01:14.640> wood<00:01:14.880> and<00:01:15.090> I'm

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
tremendous problems of the wood and I'm

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.580 
tremendous problems of the wood and I'm
going<00:01:15.390> to<00:01:15.450> go<00:01:15.540> into<00:01:15.689> that<00:01:15.930> a<00:01:15.960> little<00:01:16.170> bit<00:01:16.290> later

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
going to go into that a little bit later

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.980 
going to go into that a little bit later
and<00:01:16.890> at<00:01:17.729> this<00:01:17.970> point<00:01:18.240> I'm<00:01:18.450> going<00:01:18.630> to<00:01:18.720> show<00:01:18.930> you

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
and at this point I'm going to show you

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.630 
and at this point I'm going to show you
this<00:01:19.259> little<00:01:19.439> demonstration<00:01:19.830> on<00:01:20.369> how<00:01:20.580> you

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
this little demonstration on how you

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.609 
this little demonstration on how you
identify<00:01:20.909> the<00:01:21.420> difference<00:01:21.900> between<00:01:22.110> the<00:01:22.439> two

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
identify the difference between the two

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.620 
identify the difference between the two
so<00:01:23.250> I'm<00:01:23.369> going<00:01:23.520> to<00:01:23.580> pick<00:01:23.790> up<00:01:23.820> two<00:01:24.000> pieces<00:01:24.600> of

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
so I'm going to pick up two pieces of

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.719 
so I'm going to pick up two pieces of
this<00:01:24.900> oak<00:01:25.229> over<00:01:25.619> here<00:01:25.770> on<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:26.040> right<00:01:26.220> one<00:01:26.610> is

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
this oak over here on the right one is

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.850 
this oak over here on the right one is
going<00:01:26.820> to<00:01:26.880> be<00:01:27.630> a<00:01:27.659> piece<00:01:27.900> of<00:01:28.049> red<00:01:28.259> oak<00:01:28.439> and<00:01:28.650> one

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
going to be a piece of red oak and one

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.380 
going to be a piece of red oak and one
is<00:01:28.920> going<00:01:29.040> to<00:01:29.130> be<00:01:29.250> a<00:01:29.280> piece<00:01:29.549> of<00:01:29.700> white<00:01:29.880> oak<00:01:29.909> I'm

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
is going to be a piece of white oak I'm

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.359 
is going to be a piece of white oak I'm
going<00:01:30.689> to<00:01:30.750> dip<00:01:30.960> them<00:01:31.049> into<00:01:31.259> this<00:01:31.470> alcohol<00:01:32.100> and

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
going to dip them into this alcohol and

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.130 
going to dip them into this alcohol and
you're<00:01:32.520> going<00:01:32.700> to<00:01:32.759> see<00:01:33.060> that<00:01:33.600> the<00:01:33.750> alcohol

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
you're going to see that the alcohol

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.109 
you're going to see that the alcohol
will<00:01:34.380> soak<00:01:34.710> up<00:01:34.740> through<00:01:35.159> the<00:01:35.280> red<00:01:35.490> oak<00:01:35.640> almost

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
will soak up through the red oak almost

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.480 
will soak up through the red oak almost
immediately<00:01:36.689> and<00:01:36.900> appear<00:01:37.200> on<00:01:37.350> the<00:01:37.470> top<00:01:37.680> or

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
immediately and appear on the top or

immediately and appear on the top or
what<00:01:38.759> you<00:01:38.880> can<00:01:39.000> see<00:01:39.240> going<00:01:39.450> on<00:01:39.630> here<00:01:39.930> is<00:01:40.079> the

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
what you can see going on here is the

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.740 
what you can see going on here is the
alcohol<00:01:40.619> is<00:01:40.920> starting<00:01:41.280> to<00:01:41.369> appear<00:01:41.790> on<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:42.540> top

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.300 
alcohol is starting to appear on the top
of<00:01:42.930> this<00:01:43.079> piece<00:01:43.320> of<00:01:43.350> wood<00:01:43.619> right<00:01:43.829> here<00:01:43.890> right

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
of this piece of wood right here right

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.130 
of this piece of wood right here right
away<00:01:44.460> now<00:01:45.299> you<00:01:45.360> see<00:01:45.630> a<00:01:45.659> little<00:01:45.930> bit<00:01:46.049> of

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
away now you see a little bit of

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.200 
away now you see a little bit of
capillary<00:01:46.710> action<00:01:46.979> over<00:01:47.490> here<00:01:47.520> on<00:01:47.790> this<00:01:47.939> piece

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
capillary action over here on this piece

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.389 
capillary action over here on this piece
around<00:01:48.479> the<00:01:48.659> outside<00:01:49.259> but<00:01:49.590> that<00:01:49.619> is<00:01:49.920> just<00:01:50.250> on

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
around the outside but that is just on

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:51.950 
around the outside but that is just on
the<00:01:50.549> outside<00:01:50.939> and<00:01:51.240> then<00:01:51.420> you<00:01:51.450> see<00:01:51.720> a<00:01:51.750> little

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
the outside and then you see a little

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.630 
the outside and then you see a little
bit<00:01:52.170> of<00:01:52.350> alcohol<00:01:52.530> appearing<00:01:53.189> right<00:01:53.310> here<00:01:53.520> but

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
bit of alcohol appearing right here but

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.389 
bit of alcohol appearing right here but
that's<00:01:53.820> in<00:01:53.970> a<00:01:54.060> check<00:01:54.420> that<00:01:55.020> check<00:01:55.439> is<00:01:55.680> on<00:01:56.130> one

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
that's in a check that check is on one

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.940 
that's in a check that check is on one
of<00:01:56.430> the<00:01:56.579> medullary<00:01:57.090> rays<00:01:57.509> at<00:01:57.840> a<00:01:57.869> 90<00:01:58.350> degrees<00:01:58.740> to

of the medullary rays at a 90 degrees to
the<00:01:59.070> annual<00:01:59.430> rings<00:01:59.700> but<00:02:00.240> you<00:02:00.299> don't<00:02:00.509> see<00:02:00.689> any

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
the annual rings but you don't see any

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.990 
the annual rings but you don't see any
alcohol<00:02:01.350> coming<00:02:01.740> up<00:02:01.920> in<00:02:02.070> between<00:02:02.610> the<00:02:02.759> growth

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
alcohol coming up in between the growth

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.090 
alcohol coming up in between the growth
rings<00:02:03.329> where<00:02:03.570> you<00:02:03.659> see<00:02:03.930> it<00:02:04.020> here<00:02:04.320> just<00:02:04.829> all

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
rings where you see it here just all

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.609 
rings where you see it here just all
over<00:02:05.490> the<00:02:05.729> place<00:02:06.000> so<00:02:06.030> this<00:02:06.869> red<00:02:07.170> oak<00:02:07.439> is

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
over the place so this red oak is

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.160 
over the place so this red oak is
continuous<00:02:08.459> pour<00:02:08.789> it's<00:02:09.030> like<00:02:09.149> straws<00:02:09.629> going

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
continuous pour it's like straws going

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.600 
continuous pour it's like straws going
from<00:02:10.379> one<00:02:10.619> end<00:02:10.649> of<00:02:10.890> the<00:02:11.009> wood<00:02:11.160> to<00:02:11.340> the<00:02:11.459> other

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
from one end of the wood to the other

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.690 
from one end of the wood to the other
and<00:02:11.910> the<00:02:12.480> porosity<00:02:12.900> in<00:02:13.379> between<00:02:13.950> annual<00:02:14.459> rings

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
and the porosity in between annual rings

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.460 
and the porosity in between annual rings
and<00:02:14.940> the<00:02:15.000> white<00:02:15.180> oak<00:02:15.360> is<00:02:15.540> kind<00:02:15.750> of<00:02:15.780> like<00:02:15.930> bamboo

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
and the white oak is kind of like bamboo

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.660 
and the white oak is kind of like bamboo
it's<00:02:16.980> segmented<00:02:17.430> so<00:02:18.330> it<00:02:18.450> blocks<00:02:18.840> that

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
it's segmented so it blocks that

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:22.400 
it's segmented so it blocks that
transfer<00:02:20.670> of<00:02:20.700> that<00:02:21.060> capillary<00:02:21.510> action<00:02:22.020> this

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
transfer of that capillary action this

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:23.720 
transfer of that capillary action this
is<00:02:22.470> what's<00:02:22.800> going<00:02:22.980> on<00:02:23.190> over<00:02:23.489> here<00:02:23.580> is

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
is what's going on over here is

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.449 
is what's going on over here is
capillary<00:02:24.180> action<00:02:24.629> and<00:02:25.080> in<00:02:25.560> this<00:02:25.709> one<00:02:25.980> the

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
capillary action and in this one the

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:29.000 
capillary action and in this one the
capillary<00:02:26.970> action<00:02:27.209> is<00:02:27.480> certainly<00:02:27.930> less<00:02:28.349> much

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
capillary action is certainly less much

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:33.589 
capillary action is certainly less much
less<00:02:30.920> now<00:02:31.920> I've<00:02:32.129> lowered<00:02:32.610> in<00:02:32.760> two<00:02:33.060> more<00:02:33.330> pieces

00:02:33.589 --> 00:02:33.599 
less now I've lowered in two more pieces

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:37.670 
less now I've lowered in two more pieces
of<00:02:33.840> oak<00:02:34.170> the<00:02:35.099> oak<00:02:35.310> on<00:02:35.550> my<00:02:35.760> right<00:02:36.150> is<00:02:36.390> no<00:02:37.019> Weejun

of oak the oak on my right is no Weejun
oak<00:02:37.950> from<00:02:38.730> an<00:02:38.849> 8<00:02:39.030> meter<00:02:39.239> that<00:02:39.599> I<00:02:39.629> own<00:02:39.959> out<00:02:40.470> of

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
oak from an 8 meter that I own out of

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:42.589 
oak from an 8 meter that I own out of

the floor timbers and oak on the left

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:46.160 
the floor timbers and oak on the left
was<00:02:42.900> sold<00:02:43.200> as<00:02:43.440> Danish<00:02:44.069> white<00:02:44.400> oak<00:02:44.670> but<00:02:45.420> I'm<00:02:45.870> not

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
was sold as Danish white oak but I'm not

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.290 
was sold as Danish white oak but I'm not
so<00:02:46.379> sure<00:02:46.590> that<00:02:46.650> it's<00:02:46.980> white<00:02:47.190> oak<00:02:47.400> because<00:02:47.849> look

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
so sure that it's white oak because look

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.000 
so sure that it's white oak because look
at<00:02:48.420> it<00:02:48.480> soak<00:02:48.810> in<00:02:48.840> that<00:02:49.019> alcohol<00:02:49.739> to<00:02:49.980> the

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
at it soak in that alcohol to the

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.670 
at it soak in that alcohol to the
surface<00:02:50.550> to<00:02:50.849> me<00:02:51.030> that's<00:02:51.540> a<00:02:51.780> species<00:02:52.260> of<00:02:52.440> red

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
surface to me that's a species of red

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.339 
surface to me that's a species of red
oak<00:02:52.860> now<00:02:53.430> white<00:02:53.730> oak<00:02:53.910> is<00:02:54.060> used<00:02:54.360> for<00:02:55.110> liquid

00:02:55.339 --> 00:02:55.349 
oak now white oak is used for liquid

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:57.530 
oak now white oak is used for liquid
barrels<00:02:56.010> like<00:02:56.190> whiskey<00:02:56.670> barrels<00:02:57.060> because<00:02:57.300> the

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
barrels like whiskey barrels because the

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.869 
barrels like whiskey barrels because the
whiskey<00:02:57.900> stays<00:02:58.170> in<00:02:58.409> the<00:02:58.500> barrel<00:02:58.860> and<00:02:59.010> red<00:02:59.730> oak

00:02:59.869 --> 00:02:59.879 
whiskey stays in the barrel and red oak

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:02.330 
whiskey stays in the barrel and red oak
is<00:03:00.060> only<00:03:00.239> used<00:03:00.510> for<00:03:00.659> grain<00:03:01.050> if<00:03:01.409> you<00:03:01.950> use<00:03:02.159> the

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
is only used for grain if you use the

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.399 
is only used for grain if you use the
red<00:03:02.550> oak<00:03:02.730> barrel<00:03:03.180> for<00:03:03.480> whiskey<00:03:03.870> the<00:03:04.050> whiskey

00:03:04.399 --> 00:03:04.409 
red oak barrel for whiskey the whiskey

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:06.339 
red oak barrel for whiskey the whiskey
would<00:03:04.500> be<00:03:04.590> out<00:03:04.739> on<00:03:04.890> the<00:03:04.980> floor<00:03:05.220> in<00:03:05.250> no<00:03:05.580> time<00:03:05.879> and

00:03:06.339 --> 00:03:06.349 
would be out on the floor in no time and

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:09.500 
would be out on the floor in no time and
that<00:03:07.349> would<00:03:07.470> be<00:03:07.620> a<00:03:07.650> problem<00:03:07.950> now<00:03:08.790> I've<00:03:09.000> put<00:03:09.269> two

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
that would be a problem now I've put two

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.750 
that would be a problem now I've put two
more<00:03:09.780> pieces<00:03:10.019> of<00:03:10.260> oak<00:03:10.560> into<00:03:10.950> the<00:03:11.069> alcohol<00:03:11.580> and

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
more pieces of oak into the alcohol and

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.190 
more pieces of oak into the alcohol and
I<00:03:11.849> think<00:03:12.060> you'll<00:03:12.209> be<00:03:12.360> able<00:03:12.480> to<00:03:12.659> tell<00:03:12.870> quite

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
I think you'll be able to tell quite

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.199 
I think you'll be able to tell quite
easily<00:03:13.500> which<00:03:14.010> one<00:03:14.250> is<00:03:14.430> red<00:03:14.670> oak<00:03:14.849> and<00:03:15.060> which

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
easily which one is red oak and which

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:17.690 
easily which one is red oak and which
one<00:03:15.450> is<00:03:15.659> white<00:03:15.900> oak<00:03:15.950> look<00:03:16.950> at<00:03:17.069> the<00:03:17.190> alcohol

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
one is white oak look at the alcohol

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.399 
one is white oak look at the alcohol
starting<00:03:18.120> to<00:03:18.209> appear<00:03:18.569> on<00:03:18.750> the<00:03:18.870> surface<00:03:19.110> of

this piece right here the porosity is so

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:24.170 
this piece right here the porosity is so
great<00:03:22.470> that<00:03:22.709> the<00:03:22.830> alcohol<00:03:23.220> just<00:03:23.459> sucks<00:03:23.909> right

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
great that the alcohol just sucks right

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.180 
great that the alcohol just sucks right

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:55.739 
so also does a white oak it's very hard

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:57.110 
so also does a white oak it's very hard
to<00:03:55.920> see<00:03:56.129> them<00:03:56.250> right<00:03:56.459> here<00:03:56.489> maybe<00:03:56.819> in<00:03:57.030> the

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 
to see them right here maybe in the

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.390 
to see them right here maybe in the
camera<00:03:57.540> but<00:03:57.989> they're<00:03:58.200> in<00:03:58.349> here<00:03:58.530> 90<00:03:58.860> degrees<00:03:59.220> to

piece of oak and that's the problem with

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:06.500 
piece of oak and that's the problem with
red<00:05:05.550> oak<00:05:05.730> right<00:05:06.000> there

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:06.510 
red oak right there

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:09.290 
red oak right there
now<00:05:07.020> when<00:05:07.320> salt<00:05:07.710> water<00:05:08.040> soaks<00:05:08.520> up<00:05:08.760> into<00:05:09.090> red

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:09.300 
now when salt water soaks up into red

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:11.720 
now when salt water soaks up into red
oak<00:05:09.480> and<00:05:09.750> if<00:05:10.260> the<00:05:10.410> red<00:05:10.590> oak<00:05:10.740> is<00:05:10.980> sticking<00:05:11.550> out

oak and if the red oak is sticking out
of<00:05:11.940> the<00:05:12.060> water<00:05:12.270> what<00:05:12.870> happens<00:05:13.320> is<00:05:13.590> as<00:05:13.830> the<00:05:14.310> salt

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:14.550 
of the water what happens is as the salt

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:16.670 
of the water what happens is as the salt
water<00:05:14.850> gets<00:05:15.450> above<00:05:15.750> the<00:05:15.990> water<00:05:16.230> line<00:05:16.500> it

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:16.680 
water gets above the water line it

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:18.410 
water gets above the water line it
starts<00:05:16.920> to<00:05:17.010> dry<00:05:17.310> out<00:05:17.340> at<00:05:17.730> the<00:05:17.820> top<00:05:18.060> and<00:05:18.360> it

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:18.420 
starts to dry out at the top and it

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:19.910 
starts to dry out at the top and it
leaves<00:05:18.600> the<00:05:18.780> salt<00:05:19.050> behind<00:05:19.260> it's<00:05:19.710> like<00:05:19.890> a

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:19.920 
leaves the salt behind it's like a

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:22.490 
leaves the salt behind it's like a
desalination<00:05:20.340> plant<00:05:20.550> and<00:05:21.360> then<00:05:21.960> as<00:05:22.170> the<00:05:22.470> water

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:22.500 
desalination plant and then as the water

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:24.500 
desalination plant and then as the water
dries<00:05:23.040> out<00:05:23.310> well<00:05:23.550> it<00:05:23.670> soaks<00:05:23.910> up<00:05:24.120> some<00:05:24.330> more

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:24.510 
dries out well it soaks up some more

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:26.810 
dries out well it soaks up some more
water<00:05:24.780> and<00:05:25.080> that<00:05:25.500> dries<00:05:25.770> out<00:05:26.010> at<00:05:26.190> the<00:05:26.280> top<00:05:26.490> too

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:26.820 
water and that dries out at the top too

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:30.410 
water and that dries out at the top too
and<00:05:27.060> the<00:05:27.450> volume<00:05:27.960> of<00:05:28.170> salt<00:05:28.580> retains<00:05:29.580> into<00:05:30.300> the

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:30.420 
and the volume of salt retains into the

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:32.150 
and the volume of salt retains into the
oak<00:05:30.600> and<00:05:30.870> it<00:05:31.110> builds<00:05:31.410> and<00:05:31.680> builds<00:05:31.710> and<00:05:32.070> builds

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:32.160

and<00:05:34.650> the<00:05:35.160> content<00:05:35.760> of<00:05:35.910> salt<00:05:36.630> just<00:05:36.900> gets<00:05:37.110> to<00:05:37.260> be

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:37.290 
and the content of salt just gets to be

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:39.980 
and the content of salt just gets to be
so<00:05:37.620> much<00:05:37.920> that<00:05:37.950> with<00:05:38.790> the<00:05:38.940> induction<00:05:39.300> of<00:05:39.570> DC

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:39.990 
so much that with the induction of DC

salt water the ions in the salt conduct
the<00:05:45.570> electricity<00:05:45.840> and<00:05:46.410> it<00:05:46.830> breaks<00:05:47.130> down<00:05:47.310> the

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:47.640 
the electricity and it breaks down the

sodium hydroxide is lye
it<00:05:55.470> pretty<00:05:55.740> much<00:05:55.830> burns<00:05:56.310> up<00:05:56.580> anything<00:05:56.970> you<00:05:57.270> put

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:57.450 
it pretty much burns up anything you put

00:05:57.450 --> 00:06:00.530 
it pretty much burns up anything you put
