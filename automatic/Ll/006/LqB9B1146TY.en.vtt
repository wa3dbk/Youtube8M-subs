during each season crappies display a

during each season crappies display a

to find when conditions get tough they

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.209 
to find when conditions get tough they

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:34.680 

Wow<00:00:31.230> and<00:00:32.230> you<00:00:32.320> know<00:00:32.470> Fisher<00:00:33.300> that<00:00:34.300> can<00:00:34.480> seem

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:34.690 
Wow and you know Fisher that can seem

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:36.110 
Wow and you know Fisher that can seem
like<00:00:34.900> they're<00:00:35.110> just<00:00:35.140> incredibly

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
like they're just incredibly

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.510 
like they're just incredibly
unpredictable<00:00:37.120> and<00:00:38.080> yet<00:00:38.290> we<00:00:39.070> know<00:00:39.250> enough

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:39.520 
unpredictable and yet we know enough

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:41.250 
unpredictable and yet we know enough
about<00:00:39.790> all<00:00:40.000> of<00:00:40.150> these<00:00:40.240> fish<00:00:40.540> that<00:00:40.870> they're

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:41.260 
about all of these fish that they're

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:42.990 
about all of these fish that they're
also<00:00:41.470> predictable<00:00:42.250> at<00:00:42.370> least<00:00:42.580> up<00:00:42.730> to<00:00:42.760> a<00:00:42.910> point

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:43.000 
also predictable at least up to a point

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.270 
also predictable at least up to a point
and<00:00:43.600> by<00:00:44.170> that<00:00:44.350> I<00:00:44.380> mean<00:00:44.680> you<00:00:45.040> know<00:00:45.130> with

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:45.280 
and by that I mean you know with

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.180 
and by that I mean you know with
crappies<00:00:45.840> you<00:00:46.840> know<00:00:46.960> we<00:00:47.110> know<00:00:47.350> where<00:00:48.010> they're

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:48.190 
crappies you know we know where they're

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:50.640 
crappies you know we know where they're
going<00:00:48.370> to<00:00:48.489> be<00:00:48.790> when<00:00:49.270> they<00:00:49.420> spawn<00:00:49.780> we<00:00:50.440> don't

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:50.650 
going to be when they spawn we don't

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:52.799 
going to be when they spawn we don't
know<00:00:51.070> specifically<00:00:51.940> always<00:00:52.420> where<00:00:52.660> they're

00:00:52.799 --> 00:00:52.809 
know specifically always where they're

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:54.330 
know specifically always where they're
going<00:00:53.020> to<00:00:53.080> be<00:00:53.260> but<00:00:53.470> we<00:00:53.620> know<00:00:53.800> approximately

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:54.340 
going to be but we know approximately

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:57.479 
going to be but we know approximately
where<00:00:55.120> to<00:00:55.239> look<00:00:55.420> and<00:00:55.890> it's<00:00:56.890> the<00:00:57.010> same<00:00:57.220> in<00:00:57.400> the

00:00:57.479 --> 00:00:57.489 
where to look and it's the same in the

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:00.360 
where to look and it's the same in the
winter<00:00:57.760> time<00:00:57.940> these<00:00:58.480> fish<00:00:58.809> you<00:00:59.080> know<00:00:59.890> it's<00:01:00.070> I

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:00.370 
winter time these fish you know it's I

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:03.329 
winter time these fish you know it's I
mean<00:01:00.940> it's<00:01:01.059> just<00:01:01.180> like<00:01:01.690> clockwork<00:01:02.589> they<00:01:03.010> drop

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:03.339 
mean it's just like clockwork they drop

00:01:03.339 --> 00:01:05.580 
mean it's just like clockwork they drop
into<00:01:03.640> Basin<00:01:04.210> areas<00:01:04.540> on<00:01:04.750> the<00:01:04.989> various<00:01:05.320> lakes

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:05.590 
into Basin areas on the various lakes

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:07.860 
into Basin areas on the various lakes
and<00:01:05.920> it<00:01:06.910> doesn't<00:01:07.180> make<00:01:07.270> any<00:01:07.390> difference<00:01:07.480> if

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:07.870 
and it doesn't make any difference if

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:09.480 
and it doesn't make any difference if
it's<00:01:08.020> a<00:01:08.080> Canadian<00:01:08.380> like<00:01:08.740> like<00:01:08.950> we're<00:01:09.130> on<00:01:09.280> right

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:09.490 
it's a Canadian like like we're on right

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:11.610 
it's a Canadian like like we're on right
here<00:01:09.760> or<00:01:10.330> if<00:01:10.540> you're<00:01:10.720> on<00:01:10.750> a<00:01:10.870> stick<00:01:11.170> Marsh<00:01:11.410> in

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:11.620 
here or if you're on a stick Marsh in

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:14.760 
here or if you're on a stick Marsh in
Florida<00:01:12.040> or<00:01:12.100> on<00:01:12.630> Lake<00:01:13.630> Fork<00:01:13.960> in<00:01:14.170> Texas<00:01:14.590> they

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:14.770 
Florida or on Lake Fork in Texas they

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:16.620 
Florida or on Lake Fork in Texas they
drop<00:01:15.010> into<00:01:15.280> basin<00:01:15.670> areas<00:01:15.909> and<00:01:16.090> by<00:01:16.150> that<00:01:16.330> I<00:01:16.360> mean

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:16.630 
drop into basin areas and by that I mean

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:19.560 
drop into basin areas and by that I mean
they<00:01:17.110> move<00:01:17.320> out<00:01:17.470> of<00:01:17.530> the<00:01:17.710> shallows<00:01:18.190> and<00:01:18.570> they

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:19.570 
they move out of the shallows and they

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:23.310 
they move out of the shallows and they
just<00:01:19.780> drop<00:01:20.080> deeper<00:01:20.530> beautiful<00:01:21.159> fish<00:01:21.420> and<00:01:22.420> they

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:23.320 
just drop deeper beautiful fish and they

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:25.140 
just drop deeper beautiful fish and they
school<00:01:23.590> up<00:01:23.830> and<00:01:24.070> everything<00:01:24.490> kind<00:01:24.850> of<00:01:24.909> drops

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:25.150 
school up and everything kind of drops

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:27.540 
school up and everything kind of drops
into<00:01:25.450> these<00:01:25.600> Basin<00:01:26.020> areas<00:01:26.350> simply<00:01:27.190> because

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:27.550 
into these Basin areas simply because

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:29.550 
into these Basin areas simply because
that's<00:01:27.880> where<00:01:28.060> the<00:01:28.150> warmest<00:01:28.510> water<00:01:28.720> is<00:01:28.990> now

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:29.560 
that's where the warmest water is now

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:31.110 
that's where the warmest water is now
when<00:01:29.710> you<00:01:29.800> go<00:01:29.890> looking<00:01:30.190> for<00:01:30.250> these<00:01:30.460> basins<00:01:30.940> I

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:31.120 
when you go looking for these basins I

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:33.360 
when you go looking for these basins I
think<00:01:31.360> the<00:01:31.810> most<00:01:32.350> important<00:01:32.860> thing<00:01:33.040> is<00:01:33.220> is

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:33.370 
think the most important thing is is

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:35.250 
think the most important thing is is
that<00:01:33.520> you<00:01:33.940> can't<00:01:34.180> just<00:01:34.390> go<00:01:34.630> looking<00:01:34.960> for<00:01:34.990> deep

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:35.260 
that you can't just go looking for deep

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.590 
that you can't just go looking for deep
water<00:01:35.560> you<00:01:36.550> know<00:01:36.610> what<00:01:36.970> we've<00:01:37.120> got<00:01:37.300> here<00:01:37.540> is

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:37.600 
water you know what we've got here is

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.840 
water you know what we've got here is
we've<00:01:37.660> got<00:01:37.780> giant<00:01:38.440> shallow<00:01:38.830> bay<00:01:39.130> giant

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:39.850 
we've got giant shallow bay giant

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:41.580 
we've got giant shallow bay giant
shallow<00:01:40.120> Bay<00:01:40.390> another<00:01:40.630> giant<00:01:40.990> shallow<00:01:41.350> bay

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:41.590 
shallow Bay another giant shallow bay

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:43.680 
shallow Bay another giant shallow bay

away
this<00:01:44.650> is<00:01:44.800> crappie<00:01:45.250> habitat<00:01:45.850> all<00:01:46.120> through<00:01:46.510> here

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:46.780 
this is crappie habitat all through here

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:49.500 
this is crappie habitat all through here
to<00:01:47.200> begin<00:01:47.530> with<00:01:47.710> and<00:01:47.950> so<00:01:48.700> when<00:01:48.970> winter<00:01:49.300> comes

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:49.510 
to begin with and so when winter comes

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:51.660 
to begin with and so when winter comes
actually<00:01:49.840> when<00:01:50.140> fall<00:01:50.410> starts<00:01:50.950> he<00:01:51.100> drops<00:01:51.520> to

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:51.670 
actually when fall starts he drops to

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:53.760 
actually when fall starts he drops to
about<00:01:51.760> 50<00:01:52.150> degrees<00:01:52.480> these<00:01:53.050> fish<00:01:53.350> start<00:01:53.650> to

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:53.770 
about 50 degrees these fish start to

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:55.520 
about 50 degrees these fish start to

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
filter from the back ends of these bass

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.560 
filter from the back ends of these bass

that's<00:02:01.030> what<00:02:01.180> we've<00:02:01.330> got<00:02:01.540> here<00:02:01.720> thirty-six

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:02.290 
that's what we've got here thirty-six

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:08.430 
that's what we've got here thirty-six
feet<00:02:02.350> where<00:02:02.680> I'm<00:02:02.770> fishing<00:02:02.980> right<00:02:03.280> here

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:08.440 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.220 

no<00:02:08.979> it's<00:02:09.220> beautiful<00:02:09.400> crappy<00:02:10.119> look<00:02:10.300> at<00:02:10.390> this

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
no it's beautiful crappy look at this

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:13.900 
no it's beautiful crappy look at this
and<00:02:12.739> again<00:02:12.980> what<00:02:13.160> happens<00:02:13.520> when<00:02:13.670> they<00:02:13.760> get

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
and again what happens when they get

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:17.979 
and again what happens when they get
into<00:02:14.090> these<00:02:14.239> basins<00:02:14.720> so<00:02:14.900> often<00:02:15.700> is<00:02:16.700> that<00:02:16.989> you

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:17.989 
into these basins so often is that you

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:20.140 
into these basins so often is that you
know<00:02:18.110> the<00:02:18.349> crappie<00:02:18.800> does<00:02:18.980> not<00:02:19.160> move<00:02:19.400> fast<00:02:19.760> and

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
know the crappie does not move fast and

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.509 
know the crappie does not move fast and
they<00:02:20.780> get<00:02:20.959> into<00:02:21.170> school<00:02:21.230> sometimes<00:02:22.040> sometimes

00:02:22.509 --> 00:02:22.519 
they get into school sometimes sometimes

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:25.869 
they get into school sometimes sometimes
not<00:02:22.610> but<00:02:23.150> they<00:02:23.840> kind<00:02:24.080> of<00:02:24.170> drift<00:02:24.560> and<00:02:25.129> you<00:02:25.730> can

00:02:25.869 --> 00:02:25.879 
not but they kind of drift and you can

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:27.490 
not but they kind of drift and you can
get<00:02:26.060> on<00:02:26.180> to<00:02:26.360> a<00:02:26.390> hole<00:02:26.690> and<00:02:26.989> you'll<00:02:27.080> have<00:02:27.230> a<00:02:27.260> lot

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
get on to a hole and you'll have a lot

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.290 
get on to a hole and you'll have a lot
of<00:02:27.530> fish<00:02:27.860> in<00:02:28.040> a<00:02:28.129> vicinity<00:02:28.580> of<00:02:28.610> that<00:02:28.730> hole<00:02:29.090> and

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:29.300 
of fish in a vicinity of that hole and

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:31.690 
of fish in a vicinity of that hole and
then<00:02:30.080> you'll<00:02:30.440> go<00:02:30.620> ten<00:02:30.860> holes<00:02:31.130> and<00:02:31.489> you<00:02:31.550> won't

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
then you'll go ten holes and you won't

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.330 
then you'll go ten holes and you won't
have<00:02:31.849> anything<00:02:32.120> gone<00:02:32.450> so<00:02:33.110> you<00:02:33.200> got<00:02:33.349> a<00:02:33.380> practice

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
have anything gone so you got a practice

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.430 
have anything gone so you got a practice
mobility<00:02:35.269> once<00:02:35.480> again<00:02:35.750> when<00:02:35.989> your<00:02:36.110> crappie

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440 
mobility once again when your crappie

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.559 
mobility once again when your crappie
fishing<00:02:36.470> and<00:02:37.010> right<00:02:37.760> now<00:02:37.940> the<00:02:38.000> other<00:02:38.269> thing

00:02:38.559 --> 00:02:38.569 
fishing and right now the other thing

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:41.740 
fishing and right now the other thing
that's<00:02:38.690> really<00:02:38.810> been<00:02:39.230> vitally<00:02:40.160> important<00:02:40.790> is

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
that's really been vitally important is

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:44.920 
that's really been vitally important is
this<00:02:41.959> spring<00:02:42.230> bobber<00:02:42.470> chip<00:02:43.510> you<00:02:44.510> know<00:02:44.599> earlier

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
this spring bobber chip you know earlier

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:47.320 
this spring bobber chip you know earlier
I<00:02:45.019> always<00:02:45.440> start<00:02:45.920> very<00:02:46.430> aggressively<00:02:47.060> when

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:47.330 
I always start very aggressively when

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:49.150 
I always start very aggressively when
I'm<00:02:47.450> fishing<00:02:47.690> so<00:02:48.319> I<00:02:48.380> usually<00:02:48.530> start<00:02:48.709> with<00:02:49.130> a

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
I'm fishing so I usually start with a

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.069 
I'm fishing so I usually start with a
spoon<00:02:49.519> instead<00:02:50.000> of<00:02:50.090> a<00:02:50.180> horizontal<00:02:50.360> hanging

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:51.079 
spoon instead of a horizontal hanging

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:53.050 
spoon instead of a horizontal hanging
jig<00:02:51.319> but<00:02:51.500> not<00:02:51.680> always<00:02:52.010> but<00:02:52.519> this<00:02:52.700> is<00:02:52.849> what's

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
jig but not always but this is what's

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:54.880 
jig but not always but this is what's
been<00:02:53.450> necessary<00:02:54.049> it's<00:02:54.230> just<00:02:54.260> a<00:02:54.440> little<00:02:54.620> tiny

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:54.890 
been necessary it's just a little tiny

been necessary it's just a little tiny
jig<00:02:55.280> I've<00:02:55.760> got<00:02:56.030> a<00:02:56.060> tip<00:02:56.329> with<00:02:56.510> Berkley<00:02:56.870> Gulp

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:58.610 
and I'm letting it down to the level of

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:00.370
