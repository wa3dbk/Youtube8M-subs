right now I'm doing these two horse
portraits<00:00:18.180> for<00:00:18.660> a<00:00:19.050> client<00:00:20.150> hopefully<00:00:21.150> you<00:00:21.210> can

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
portraits for a client hopefully you can

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:27.140 
portraits for a client hopefully you can
see<00:00:21.660> those<00:00:21.869> there<00:00:23.449> so<00:00:24.769> and<00:00:25.769> what<00:00:26.189> I<00:00:26.220> did<00:00:26.519> and

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
see those there so and what I did and

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.160 
see those there so and what I did and
you<00:00:27.269> can<00:00:27.420> see<00:00:27.599> a<00:00:27.630> close-up<00:00:27.930> of<00:00:28.260> it<00:00:28.439> is<00:00:28.730> I

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:30.170 
you can see a close-up of it is I

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:33.319 
you can see a close-up of it is I
divided<00:00:31.170> the<00:00:31.289> canvas<00:00:31.650> in<00:00:31.800> half<00:00:32.040> and<00:00:32.430> then<00:00:33.210> in

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
divided the canvas in half and then in

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.770 
divided the canvas in half and then in
half<00:00:33.360> again<00:00:33.739> so<00:00:34.739> I<00:00:34.820> drew<00:00:35.820> a<00:00:35.850> grid<00:00:36.180> system<00:00:36.420> on

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
half again so I drew a grid system on

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:42.319 
half again so I drew a grid system on
this<00:00:36.960> and<00:00:37.260> what<00:00:38.040> what<00:00:38.489> that<00:00:38.700> does<00:00:40.760> is<00:00:41.760> it<00:00:42.090> and

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
this and what what that does is it and

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:48.819 
this and what what that does is it and
it<00:00:42.510> it<00:00:42.780> enables<00:00:43.350> me<00:00:43.559> to<00:00:43.590> transfer<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:45.390> images

00:00:48.819 --> 00:00:48.829 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:51.290 

to<00:00:49.829> get<00:00:49.950> the<00:00:50.100> proportions<00:00:50.700> correct<00:00:50.910> and

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
to get the proportions correct and

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.450 
to get the proportions correct and
everything<00:00:51.390> correct<00:00:52.320> and<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:53.039> way<00:00:53.160> you<00:00:53.219> do

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
everything correct and the way you do

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.959 
everything correct and the way you do
this<00:00:53.640> is<00:00:53.910> I<00:00:54.860> did<00:00:55.860> it<00:00:55.980> digitally<00:00:56.730> on<00:00:56.850> my

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
this is I did it digitally on my

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.360 
this is I did it digitally on my
computer<00:00:57.449> I<00:00:57.629> had<00:00:58.199> these<00:00:58.410> I'm<00:00:58.800> going<00:00:59.100> off<00:00:59.250> the

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
computer I had these I'm going off the

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.579 
computer I had these I'm going off the
photo<00:00:59.609> references<00:01:00.210> from<00:01:01.199> the<00:01:01.289> client<00:01:03.559> so<00:01:04.559> I

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
photo references from the client so I

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.500 
photo references from the client so I
took<00:01:04.739> the<00:01:05.070> photographs<00:01:05.640> place<00:01:06.180> them<00:01:06.390> in

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
took the photographs place them in

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.070 
took the photographs place them in
Photoshop<00:01:07.049> and<00:01:07.380> I<00:01:07.619> drew<00:01:08.400> grids<00:01:08.760> on<00:01:09.119> the<00:01:09.750> actual

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
Photoshop and I drew grids on the actual

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.210 
Photoshop and I drew grids on the actual
image<00:01:10.820> and<00:01:12.260> then<00:01:13.260> I<00:01:13.350> drew<00:01:13.590> the<00:01:13.710> grids<00:01:13.950> on<00:01:14.130> the

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
image and then I drew the grids on the

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.240 
image and then I drew the grids on the
canvas<00:01:14.700> and<00:01:14.909> then<00:01:15.390> all<00:01:15.960> you<00:01:16.259> do<00:01:16.439> is<00:01:16.470> focus<00:01:17.100> on

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
canvas and then all you do is focus on

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.670 
canvas and then all you do is focus on
one<00:01:17.490> block<00:01:17.790> at<00:01:17.970> a<00:01:18.000> time<00:01:18.090> from<00:01:19.080> the<00:01:19.140> initial

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
one block at a time from the initial

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.920 
one block at a time from the initial
image<00:01:20.009> if<00:01:20.759> you<00:01:20.790> can't<00:01:21.090> do<00:01:21.240> it<00:01:21.360> digitally<00:01:21.509> you

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
image if you can't do it digitally you

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.570 
image if you can't do it digitally you
print<00:01:22.200> out<00:01:22.320> the<00:01:22.619> image<00:01:23.610> and<00:01:23.880> then<00:01:25.430> you<00:01:26.430> know

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
print out the image and then you know

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.600 
print out the image and then you know
you<00:01:26.939> make<00:01:27.150> it<00:01:27.180> proportional<00:01:28.170> to<00:01:28.500> how<00:01:29.189> big<00:01:29.430> your

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
you make it proportional to how big your

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.800 
you make it proportional to how big your
canvas<00:01:30.000> is<00:01:31.130> so<00:01:32.130> say<00:01:32.820> your<00:01:33.030> image<00:01:33.299> prints<00:01:33.689> out

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
canvas is so say your image prints out

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.350 
canvas is so say your image prints out
you<00:01:33.840> know<00:01:34.079> three<00:01:34.590> by<00:01:34.740> three<00:01:35.159> then<00:01:35.909> that's<00:01:36.150> fine

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
you know three by three then that's fine

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.210 
you know three by three then that's fine
you<00:01:36.630> just<00:01:36.869> you<00:01:37.110> know<00:01:37.229> divide<00:01:37.590> it<00:01:37.710> in<00:01:37.770> half<00:01:37.799> and

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
you just you know divide it in half and

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.399 
you just you know divide it in half and
draw<00:01:38.430> the<00:01:38.490> grids<00:01:38.880> and<00:01:39.180> then<00:01:39.869> you<00:01:39.960> do<00:01:40.079> the<00:01:40.229> same

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
draw the grids and then you do the same

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.260 
draw the grids and then you do the same
thing<00:01:40.619> on<00:01:40.740> your<00:01:40.829> canvas<00:01:41.250> and<00:01:41.430> then<00:01:41.939> you<00:01:42.060> just

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
thing on your canvas and then you just

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.480 
thing on your canvas and then you just
focus<00:01:42.689> on<00:01:42.840> what's<00:01:43.229> in<00:01:43.409> one<00:01:43.710> block<00:01:44.009> at<00:01:44.189> a<00:01:44.250> time

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
focus on what's in one block at a time

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.469 
focus on what's in one block at a time
and<00:01:44.729> draw<00:01:44.970> it<00:01:45.149> in<00:01:46.610> you<00:01:47.610> know<00:01:47.729> a<00:01:47.759> lot<00:01:47.970> of<00:01:48.000> artists

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
and draw it in you know a lot of artists

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.660 
and draw it in you know a lot of artists
might<00:01:48.630> think<00:01:48.899> oh<00:01:49.049> that's<00:01:49.229> cheating<00:01:49.799> and<00:01:50.100> you

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
might think oh that's cheating and you

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.600 
might think oh that's cheating and you
know<00:01:50.820> whatever<00:01:51.829> it<00:01:52.829> doesn't<00:01:53.040> matter<00:01:53.189> to<00:01:53.579> me

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
know whatever it doesn't matter to me

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.569 
know whatever it doesn't matter to me
what<00:01:54.570> I<00:01:54.630> want<00:01:54.960> in<00:01:55.110> the<00:01:55.200> end<00:01:55.409> and<00:01:55.890> the<00:01:56.549> end

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
what I want in the end and the end

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:01.130

look<00:02:01.350> just<00:02:02.189> like<00:02:02.340> the<00:02:02.700> horse<00:02:02.909> I<00:02:04.759> mean<00:02:05.759> it's

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
look just like the horse I mean it's

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:07.429 
look just like the horse I mean it's
still<00:02:06.299> going<00:02:06.479> to<00:02:06.509> be<00:02:06.570> difficult<00:02:07.020> I<00:02:07.110> still<00:02:07.320> have

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
still going to be difficult I still have

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.169 
still going to be difficult I still have
to<00:02:07.560> paint<00:02:07.799> all<00:02:07.979> this<00:02:08.129> in<00:02:08.340> get<00:02:08.580> all<00:02:08.670> the<00:02:08.789> image

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
to paint all this in get all the image

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.500 
to paint all this in get all the image
the<00:02:10.039> the<00:02:11.039> value<00:02:11.459> and<00:02:11.610> the<00:02:11.670> coloring<00:02:12.030> and<00:02:12.330> all

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
the the value and the coloring and all

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.490 
the the value and the coloring and all
this<00:02:12.690> stuff

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
this stuff

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.930 
this stuff
correctly<00:02:13.770> you<00:02:14.580> know<00:02:14.700> but<00:02:15.660> I<00:02:16.700> think<00:02:17.700> when<00:02:17.820> it

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
correctly you know but I think when it

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.030 
correctly you know but I think when it
comes<00:02:18.090> to<00:02:18.240> portraits<00:02:18.510> actually<00:02:19.440> drawing<00:02:19.800> it

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
comes to portraits actually drawing it

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.650 
comes to portraits actually drawing it

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
happy with them but for these forces I

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:40.730 
happy with them but for these forces I
just<00:02:39.570> wanted<00:02:39.959> to<00:02:40.110> try<00:02:40.230> something<00:02:40.320> different

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:40.740 
just wanted to try something different

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:44.920 
just wanted to try something different
and<00:02:41.340> this<00:02:42.240> grid<00:02:42.540> system<00:02:42.990> really<00:02:43.290> helped<00:02:43.680> so

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
and this grid system really helped so

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:47.600 
and this grid system really helped so
you<00:02:45.930> know<00:02:46.050> I<00:02:46.080> that's<00:02:46.890> the<00:02:47.070> first<00:02:47.100> time<00:02:47.400> I<00:02:47.459> ever

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
you know I that's the first time I ever

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:49.250 
you know I that's the first time I ever
used<00:02:47.700> a<00:02:48.000> grid<00:02:48.150> system<00:02:48.420> actually<00:02:48.840> draw

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
used a grid system actually draw

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.610 
used a grid system actually draw
something<00:02:49.709> out<00:02:50.450> but<00:02:51.450> it's<00:02:51.570> a<00:02:51.660> vital<00:02:52.050> tool<00:02:52.290> and

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
something out but it's a vital tool and

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.590 
something out but it's a vital tool and
I<00:02:53.130> think<00:02:53.340> it's<00:02:53.670> important<00:02:54.030> to<00:02:54.060> use<00:02:54.270> it<00:02:54.450> when

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
I think it's important to use it when

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:55.940 
I think it's important to use it when
you're<00:02:54.750> doing<00:02:55.020> portraits<00:02:55.290> and<00:02:55.739> really

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
you're doing portraits and really

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.370 
you're doing portraits and really
detailed<00:02:56.420> images<00:02:57.420> if<00:02:58.110> you're<00:02:58.260> doing

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
detailed images if you're doing

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.410 
detailed images if you're doing
landscape<00:02:58.950> or<00:02:59.130> something<00:02:59.489> it's<00:03:00.030> probably<00:03:00.330> not

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
landscape or something it's probably not

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.870 
landscape or something it's probably not
too<00:03:00.630> vital<00:03:01.010> but<00:03:02.010> if<00:03:02.130> you're<00:03:02.280> going<00:03:02.520> off<00:03:02.670> of<00:03:02.820> a

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 
too vital but if you're going off of a

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.390
