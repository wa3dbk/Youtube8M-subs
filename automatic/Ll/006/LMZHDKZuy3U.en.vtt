thing<00:02:37.220> in<00:02:37.310> LA<00:02:37.430> yeah<00:02:38.030> it<00:02:38.450> was<00:02:38.600> like<00:02:39.050> the

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
thing in LA yeah it was like the

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:40.690 
thing in LA yeah it was like the
showcasing<00:02:39.770> thing<00:02:39.980> so<00:02:40.130> like<00:02:40.310> people<00:02:40.610> were

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
showcasing thing so like people were

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:44.110 
showcasing thing so like people were
there<00:02:40.850> to<00:02:40.940> see<00:02:41.060> us<00:02:41.180> play<00:02:41.360> but<00:02:42.260> in<00:02:42.410> and<00:02:42.880> so<00:02:43.880> I

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
there to see us play but in and so I

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.090 
there to see us play but in and so I
kind<00:02:44.360> of<00:02:44.420> think<00:02:44.570> that<00:02:44.810> the<00:02:45.470> response<00:02:45.800> that<00:02:45.860> was

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:46.100 
kind of think that the response that was

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:48.400 
kind of think that the response that was
always<00:02:47.000> kind<00:02:47.210> of<00:02:47.240> gonna<00:02:47.360> be<00:02:47.450> good<00:02:47.690> in<00:02:48.290> that

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
always kind of gonna be good in that

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:50.080 
always kind of gonna be good in that
sense<00:02:48.680> but<00:02:49.070> in<00:02:49.220> the<00:02:49.370> UK<00:02:49.550> we<00:02:49.850> were<00:02:49.940> just

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:09.110 
and we've learned a lot in the last 12

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:12.820 
and we've learned a lot in the last 12
months<00:06:09.169> so<00:06:10.240> I'm<00:06:11.240> happy<00:06:11.930> we're<00:06:12.199> releasing<00:06:12.560> the

00:06:14.589 --> 00:06:14.599 
album now and then even though we had

00:06:14.599 --> 00:06:17.019 
album now and then even though we had
the<00:06:14.719> chance<00:06:14.930> to<00:06:15.110> do<00:06:15.259> it<00:06:15.289> 12<00:06:15.740> months<00:06:16.009> ago<00:06:16.099> we

00:06:17.019 --> 00:06:17.029 
the chance to do it 12 months ago we

00:06:17.029 --> 00:06:18.249 
the chance to do it 12 months ago we
held<00:06:17.270> off<00:06:17.449> because<00:06:17.779> I<00:06:17.870> think<00:06:17.930> we've<00:06:18.139> all

00:06:18.249 --> 00:06:18.259 
held off because I think we've all

00:06:18.259 --> 00:06:20.060 
held off because I think we've all
learnt<00:06:18.469> a<00:06:18.560> lot<00:06:18.680> in<00:06:18.740> the<00:06:18.889> last<00:06:18.979> 12<00:06:19.250> months

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:20.070
