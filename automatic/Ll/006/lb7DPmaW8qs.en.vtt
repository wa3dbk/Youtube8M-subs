a gun style car transmitter would be

00:00:36.390 --> 00:01:11.060 
a gun style car transmitter would be
even<00:00:36.690> better

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.920 

it<00:01:12.070> is<00:01:12.250> super-fun<00:01:12.520> and<00:01:12.880> maneuverable<00:01:13.479> at<00:01:13.659> slow

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:13.930 
it is super-fun and maneuverable at slow

then<00:01:29.170> decided<00:01:29.500> to<00:01:29.619> install<00:01:30.009> some<00:01:30.220> vertical

traction<00:01:35.200> much<00:01:35.920> like<00:01:36.100> a<00:01:36.130> sailboat<00:01:36.430> uses<00:01:36.850> its

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.030 
traction much like a sailboat uses its

00:01:37.030 --> 00:02:23.130 
traction much like a sailboat uses its
center<00:01:37.270> board<00:01:37.450> for<00:01:37.750> water<00:01:38.080> traction

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.330 

this<00:02:24.140> worked<00:02:24.379> exceptionally<00:02:24.769> well<00:02:25.159> and

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
this worked exceptionally well and

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:26.830 
this worked exceptionally well and
allowed<00:02:25.640> it<00:02:25.760> to<00:02:25.849> make<00:02:26.030> high<00:02:26.209> speed<00:02:26.510> tight

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
allowed it to make high speed tight

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.869 
allowed it to make high speed tight
turns<00:02:27.140> and<00:02:27.409> with<00:02:27.920> only<00:02:28.069> a<00:02:28.220> blue<00:02:28.430> wonder<00:02:28.730> and

this<00:02:30.950> would<00:02:31.099> make<00:02:31.250> a<00:02:31.280> fun<00:02:31.579> racing<00:02:31.939> sport<00:02:32.209> with

this would make a fun racing sport with
high<00:02:32.480> performance<00:02:32.689> designs<00:02:33.260> and<00:02:33.530> power
