happened with it and stuff but it's a
lot<00:01:48.600> of<00:01:48.750> fun<00:01:48.960> and<00:01:49.200> maybe<00:01:49.619> that<00:01:50.270> if<00:01:51.270> us<00:01:51.780> and<00:01:51.960> use

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:52.080 
lot of fun and maybe that if us and use

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.289 
lot of fun and maybe that if us and use
it<00:01:52.170> effectively<00:01:52.439> you<00:01:53.220> can<00:01:53.430> make<00:01:53.670> a<00:01:53.700> minigame

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
it effectively you can make a minigame

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.780 
it effectively you can make a minigame
out<00:01:54.509> of<00:01:54.659> it<00:01:54.780> or<00:01:54.900> something<00:01:55.110> like<00:01:55.290> that<00:01:55.790> but

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
out of it or something like that but

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:57.950 
out of it or something like that but
right<00:01:57.090> now<00:01:57.150> I'm<00:01:57.390> just<00:01:57.479> going<00:01:57.630> to<00:01:57.750> show<00:01:57.900> you

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
right now I'm just going to show you

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.870 
right now I'm just going to show you
this<00:01:58.799> map<00:01:59.070> that<00:01:59.280> I<00:01:59.310> loaded<00:01:59.579> up<00:01:59.670> with<00:01:59.820> a

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
this map that I loaded up with a

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.999 
this map that I loaded up with a
scorpion<00:02:00.390> and<00:02:00.450> a<00:02:00.570> wraith<00:02:00.780> and<00:02:02.180> some<00:02:03.180> weapons

scorpion and a wraith and some weapons

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:07.940 
scorpion and a wraith and some weapons
so<00:02:05.009> first<00:02:05.250> off<00:02:05.490> like<00:02:05.759> the<00:02:06.329> storm<00:02:06.659> rifle<00:02:07.170> can

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
so first off like the storm rifle can

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:12.350 
so first off like the storm rifle can
destroy<00:02:08.280> your<00:02:08.399> Wraith<00:02:09.200> really<00:02:10.200> quickly<00:02:11.000> so<00:02:12.000> as

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
destroy your Wraith really quickly so as

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.949 
destroy your Wraith really quickly so as
an<00:02:13.320> incredible<00:02:13.950> amount<00:02:14.760> of<00:02:14.820> damage<00:02:15.090> boost<00:02:15.720> to

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
an incredible amount of damage boost to

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:18.949 
an incredible amount of damage boost to
it<00:02:16.110> and<00:02:16.519> along<00:02:17.519> with<00:02:17.579> sticky<00:02:18.510> detonator<00:02:18.870> I

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
it and along with sticky detonator I

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:22.400 
it and along with sticky detonator I
have<00:02:19.170> no<00:02:19.290> idea<00:02:19.500> what<00:02:19.650> happens<00:02:19.950> when<00:02:20.549> I<00:02:21.049> I<00:02:22.049> don't

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
even know where it went

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.800 
even know where it went
after<00:02:24.810> you<00:02:24.870> shoot<00:02:25.079> it<00:02:25.430> and<00:02:26.450> when<00:02:27.450> I<00:02:27.480> try<00:02:27.750> to

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:35.970 
bullets in this
yeah<00:02:34.720> I<00:02:34.750> don't<00:02:35.110> know<00:02:35.320> what<00:02:35.470> happens<00:02:35.770> there

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980

this<00:02:36.820> song<00:02:37.150> also<00:02:37.480> has<00:02:37.600> a<00:02:37.720> really<00:02:38.080> quick

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
this song also has a really quick

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:44.750 
this song also has a really quick
I<00:02:39.280> guess<00:02:39.880> kill<00:02:40.240> time<00:02:40.480> a<00:02:40.740> damage<00:02:41.740> increase<00:02:42.780> so

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
I guess kill time a damage increase so

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:49.470 
I guess kill time a damage increase so
it's<00:02:45.760> it's<00:02:46.570> better<00:02:46.930> on<00:02:47.050> like<00:02:47.620> a<00:02:48.270> person<00:02:49.270> rather

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
it's it's better on like a person rather

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.050 
it's it's better on like a person rather
than<00:02:49.630> obviously<00:02:50.470> a<00:02:50.500> scorpion<00:02:51.040> but<00:02:51.280> it<00:02:51.880> shoots

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
than obviously a scorpion but it shoots

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.320 
than obviously a scorpion but it shoots
like<00:02:52.360> really<00:02:52.900> fast<00:02:53.200> and<00:02:53.620> it<00:02:54.430> gets<00:02:54.880> out<00:02:55.090> all<00:02:55.300> of

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:55.330 
like really fast and it gets out all of

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:59.040 
like really fast and it gets out all of
its<00:02:55.630> ammo<00:02:56.620> really<00:02:57.040> quickly<00:02:57.430> but<00:02:58.240> this<00:02:58.990> is

00:02:59.040 --> 00:02:59.050 
its ammo really quickly but this is

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:00.480 
its ammo really quickly but this is
probably<00:02:59.440> the<00:02:59.530> coolest<00:02:59.710> thing<00:02:59.890> right<00:03:00.160> here<00:03:00.370> is

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:00.490 
probably the coolest thing right here is

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
probably the coolest thing right here is
the<00:03:00.670> scorpion<00:03:01.240> and<00:03:02.140> when<00:03:02.320> you<00:03:02.410> shoot<00:03:02.650> it<00:03:03.510> it

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.510
