small it is this is it versus the n97
mini<00:00:39.450> right<00:00:40.320> there<00:00:40.710> you<00:00:41.070> can<00:00:41.250> see<00:00:41.510> it's<00:00:42.510> quite

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:42.860 
mini right there you can see it's quite

mini right there you can see it's quite
smaller<00:00:45.739> yeah<00:00:46.739> and<00:00:46.980> then<00:00:47.190> there's<00:00:47.460> it<00:00:48.120> versus

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
smaller yeah and then there's it versus

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.100 
smaller yeah and then there's it versus
the<00:00:49.050> n86<00:00:49.829> again<00:00:50.640> quite<00:00:51.270> small<00:00:51.570> compared<00:00:51.960> to<00:00:51.989> it

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
the n86 again quite small compared to it

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.510 
the n86 again quite small compared to it
right<00:00:52.500> there<00:00:52.969> so<00:00:54.199> yeah<00:00:55.199> it's<00:00:55.410> really<00:00:55.770> small

bit of a problem here because there are
no<00:04:10.020> distinct<00:04:10.650> keys<00:04:10.920> as<00:04:11.430> such<00:04:11.790> they're<00:04:12.209> all<00:04:12.270> on

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.480 
no distinct keys as such they're all on

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:16.729 
no distinct keys as such they're all on
one<00:04:12.750> flat<00:04:14.300> line<00:04:15.300> there<00:04:15.630> so<00:04:16.109> that's<00:04:16.470> something

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:16.739 
one flat line there so that's something

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:18.650 
one flat line there so that's something
you<00:04:17.430> might<00:04:17.520> want<00:04:17.760> to<00:04:17.820> know<00:04:17.910> the<00:04:18.090> keys<00:04:18.330> on<00:04:18.630> the
