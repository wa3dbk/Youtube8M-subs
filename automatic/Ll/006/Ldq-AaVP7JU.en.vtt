hi guys just want to show you world what

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:04.370 
hi guys just want to show you world what
I've<00:00:03.210> been<00:00:03.330> able<00:00:03.449> to<00:00:03.689> achieve<00:00:03.870> with<00:00:04.290> the

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:04.380 
I've been able to achieve with the

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.540 
I've been able to achieve with the
airbrush<00:00:04.710> I<00:00:06.230> had<00:00:07.230> some<00:00:07.589> pitfalls<00:00:08.189> with<00:00:08.460> the

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
airbrush I had some pitfalls with the

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.970 
airbrush I had some pitfalls with the
airbrush<00:00:08.849> and<00:00:09.269> that's<00:00:09.870> not<00:00:10.290> because<00:00:10.559> of<00:00:10.769> the

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
airbrush and that's not because of the

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:16.099 
airbrush and that's not because of the
airbrush<00:00:11.309> itself<00:00:11.759> it's<00:00:13.700> because<00:00:14.700> of<00:00:14.910> me<00:00:15.870> being

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
airbrush itself it's because of me being

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:20.689 
airbrush itself it's because of me being
new<00:00:16.320> to<00:00:16.350> the<00:00:17.000> airbrush<00:00:18.770> one<00:00:19.770> stage<00:00:20.130> a<00:00:20.160> clog<00:00:20.520> the

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
new to the airbrush one stage a clog the

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.220 
new to the airbrush one stage a clog the
airbrush<00:00:21.000> have<00:00:21.150> not<00:00:21.330> seen<00:00:21.539> him<00:00:21.689> again<00:00:21.750> color

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
airbrush have not seen him again color

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.310 
airbrush have not seen him again color
down<00:00:22.470> enough<00:00:22.830> that<00:00:23.369> took<00:00:24.150> me<00:00:24.269> a<00:00:24.300> good<00:00:24.330> 15<00:00:25.109> 20

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
down enough that took me a good 15 20

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.230 
down enough that took me a good 15 20
minutes<00:00:25.740> to<00:00:25.949> work<00:00:26.099> clean<00:00:26.460> the<00:00:26.640> airbrush<00:00:27.029> out

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
minutes to work clean the airbrush out

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.429 
minutes to work clean the airbrush out
there<00:00:27.599> and<00:00:29.000> another<00:00:30.000> time<00:00:30.240> I<00:00:30.570> was<00:00:31.050> spraying

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
there and another time I was spraying

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.220 
there and another time I was spraying
the<00:00:31.859> paint<00:00:32.399> too<00:00:32.820> thin<00:00:33.210> and<00:00:33.360> I<00:00:33.480> was<00:00:33.600> splattering

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
the paint too thin and I was splattering

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.910 
the paint too thin and I was splattering
it<00:00:34.350> around<00:00:34.680> and<00:00:35.450> got<00:00:36.450> some<00:00:37.020> even<00:00:37.320> effects<00:00:37.649> in

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
it around and got some even effects in

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.410 
it around and got some even effects in
in<00:00:38.100> places<00:00:38.460> but<00:00:39.950> on<00:00:40.950> the<00:00:41.370> whole<00:00:41.579> as<00:00:42.059> soon<00:00:42.239> as<00:00:42.390> I

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
in places but on the whole as soon as I

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:43.670 
in places but on the whole as soon as I
you<00:00:42.780> know<00:00:42.930> as<00:00:43.050> soon<00:00:43.200> as<00:00:43.350> I've<00:00:43.440> done<00:00:43.559> the

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
you know as soon as I've done the

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.010 
you know as soon as I've done the
initial<00:00:44.059> brushing<00:00:45.059> left<00:00:45.270> it<00:00:45.420> for<00:00:45.600> a<00:00:45.629> few<00:00:45.870> hours

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
initial brushing left it for a few hours

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.229 
initial brushing left it for a few hours
and<00:00:46.260> then<00:00:46.410> went<00:00:46.590> back<00:00:46.829> to<00:00:47.070> it<00:00:47.250> everything

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
and then went back to it everything

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.209 
and then went back to it everything
started<00:00:48.719> to<00:00:48.809> run<00:00:48.989> smoothly<00:00:49.350> I<00:00:49.620> started<00:00:49.980> to<00:00:50.070> get

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
started to run smoothly I started to get

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.490 
started to run smoothly I started to get
to<00:00:50.370> grips<00:00:50.579> with<00:00:50.760> the<00:00:51.449> distance<00:00:52.020> that<00:00:52.199> you<00:00:52.320> need

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
to grips with the distance that you need

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.250 
to grips with the distance that you need
to<00:00:52.649> spray<00:00:52.980> out<00:00:53.219> and<00:00:53.460> PSI<00:00:54.420> control<00:00:54.989> for

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
to spray out and PSI control for

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.979 
to spray out and PSI control for
different<00:00:55.559> types<00:00:55.800> of<00:00:56.010> jobs<00:00:56.250> and<00:00:56.809> if<00:00:57.809> you

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
different types of jobs and if you

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:59.450 
different types of jobs and if you
laying<00:00:58.199> down<00:00:58.410> a<00:00:58.440> whole<00:00:58.680> base<00:00:58.949> coat<00:00:59.250> for

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
laying down a whole base coat for

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.310 
laying down a whole base coat for
example<00:00:59.910> you'll<00:01:00.359> be<00:01:00.480> spraying<00:01:00.899> a<00:01:01.020> little

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
example you'll be spraying a little

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.560 
example you'll be spraying a little
further<00:01:01.559> away<00:01:01.859> and<00:01:02.250> you'll<00:01:02.340> be<00:01:02.399> spraying<00:01:03.329> at<00:01:03.539> a

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
further away and you'll be spraying at a

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.170 
further away and you'll be spraying at a
slightly<00:01:03.989> higher<00:01:04.110> psi<00:01:04.860> but<00:01:05.640> then<00:01:05.790> if<00:01:05.909> you<00:01:06.000> want

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
slightly higher psi but then if you want

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.899 
slightly higher psi but then if you want
to<00:01:06.210> start<00:01:06.479> shading<00:01:07.200> in<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:07.590> panel<00:01:07.950> lines<00:01:08.189> or

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
to start shading in the panel lines or

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.760 
to start shading in the panel lines or
doing<00:01:09.420> this<00:01:09.570> mud<00:01:09.840> effect<00:01:10.140> that<00:01:10.260> you<00:01:10.350> see<00:01:10.380> down

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
doing this mud effect that you see down

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.140 
doing this mud effect that you see down
here<00:01:10.830> this<00:01:11.159> was<00:01:11.369> done<00:01:11.520> with<00:01:11.610> gang<00:01:11.820> colors

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
here this was done with gang colors

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.830 
here this was done with gang colors
earth<00:01:12.479> color<00:01:13.820> I'd<00:01:14.820> drop<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.180> pier<00:01:15.390> size<00:01:15.630> down

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
earth color I'd drop the pier size down

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.940 
earth color I'd drop the pier size down
to<00:01:16.020> I<00:01:16.049> think<00:01:16.110> about<00:01:16.259> 15<00:01:16.860> or<00:01:17.040> 20<00:01:17.070> psi<00:01:17.820> and<00:01:18.890> on<00:01:19.890> a

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
to I think about 15 or 20 psi and on a

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.640 
to I think about 15 or 20 psi and on a
spraying<00:01:20.400> a<00:01:20.490> little<00:01:20.759> bit<00:01:20.880> closer<00:01:21.180> and<00:01:21.659> a<00:01:21.689> nice

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
spraying a little bit closer and a nice

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:28.219 
spraying a little bit closer and a nice
even<00:01:23.340> slow<00:01:25.220> paint<00:01:26.220> going<00:01:26.729> across<00:01:26.970> so<00:01:27.270> as<00:01:28.020> soon

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
even slow paint going across so as soon

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.230 
even slow paint going across so as soon
as<00:01:28.380> I<00:01:28.470> got<00:01:28.650> to<00:01:28.770> grips<00:01:29.070> with<00:01:29.159> that<00:01:29.490> I<00:01:29.700> started<00:01:30.150> to

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
as I got to grips with that I started to

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.600 
as I got to grips with that I started to
enjoy<00:01:30.570> for<00:01:31.079> the<00:01:31.110> first<00:01:31.500> couple<00:01:31.890> of<00:01:31.920> fatwas<00:01:32.369> oh

I've<00:01:59.130> got<00:01:59.310> a<00:01:59.340> few<00:01:59.490> drip<00:01:59.759> marks<00:02:00.180> now<00:02:00.719> because<00:02:01.259> I

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
I've got a few drip marks now because I

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.060 
I've got a few drip marks now because I
whether<00:02:01.560> my<00:02:01.740> tanks<00:02:02.100> anyway<00:02:02.490> I<00:02:02.759> can<00:02:03.270> hide<00:02:03.509> them

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.070 
whether my tanks anyway I can hide them

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:08.779 
whether my tanks anyway I can hide them
but<00:02:05.070> yeah<00:02:06.229> I<00:02:07.229> did<00:02:07.560> the<00:02:07.740> drip<00:02:07.950> marks<00:02:08.250> were<00:02:08.429> from

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
but yeah I did the drip marks were from

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.190 
but yeah I did the drip marks were from
the<00:02:08.910> initial<00:02:09.330> spraying<00:02:09.720> when<00:02:09.869> I<00:02:09.899> first

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
the initial spraying when I first

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.740 
the initial spraying when I first
started<00:02:10.709> but<00:02:10.920> towards<00:02:11.730> the

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
started but towards the

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.190 
started but towards the
latter<00:02:13.020> part<00:02:13.380> of<00:02:13.530> the<00:02:14.210> the<00:02:15.210> painting<00:02:15.930> process

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
latter part of the the painting process

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.860 
latter part of the the painting process
are<00:02:16.800> the<00:02:17.700> brush<00:02:17.940> and<00:02:18.120> went<00:02:18.240> absolutely

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
are the brush and went absolutely

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.020 
are the brush and went absolutely
perfect<00:02:19.790> a<00:02:20.960> few<00:02:21.960> things<00:02:22.170> to<00:02:22.290> touch<00:02:22.500> you<00:02:22.680> up

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
perfect a few things to touch you up

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.890 
perfect a few things to touch you up
back<00:02:24.030> plate<00:02:24.300> there<00:02:24.660> and<00:02:26.270> smooth<00:02:27.270> stuff

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
back plate there and smooth stuff

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.470 
back plate there and smooth stuff
probably<00:02:28.260> lock<00:02:28.860> off<00:02:29.100> Spider<00:02:29.550> place<00:02:30.180> there

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
probably lock off Spider place there

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.050 
probably lock off Spider place there
that<00:02:30.600> needs<00:02:31.250> chipping<00:02:32.250> up<00:02:32.340> it's<00:02:32.490> just<00:02:32.640> big

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
that needs chipping up it's just big

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.030 
that needs chipping up it's just big
black<00:02:33.300> patch<00:02:33.570> which<00:02:33.870> means<00:02:34.200> nothing<00:02:34.590> on<00:02:34.740> it<00:02:34.770> so

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
black patch which means nothing on it so

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.320 
black patch which means nothing on it so
the<00:02:36.030> decals<00:02:36.510> if<00:02:36.840> I<00:02:36.990> can<00:02:37.170> zoom<00:02:37.440> in<00:02:37.620> on<00:02:37.740> those

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:38.330 
the decals if I can zoom in on those

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:40.400 
the decals if I can zoom in on those
there's<00:02:39.330> three<00:02:39.630> there<00:02:39.870> they're<00:02:39.990> all<00:02:40.080> stacked

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
there's three there they're all stacked

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.410 
there's three there they're all stacked
on<00:02:40.590> top<00:02:40.650> of<00:02:40.830> each<00:02:41.010> other<00:02:41.370> and<00:02:41.700> now<00:02:42.090> I<00:02:42.120> think

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
on top of each other and now I think

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.440 
on top of each other and now I think
that's<00:02:42.540> turned<00:02:42.780> out<00:02:42.990> quite<00:02:43.170> well<00:02:43.500> because<00:02:43.709> I'm

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
that's turned out quite well because I'm

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:48.979 
that's turned out quite well because I'm
not<00:02:45.450> a<00:02:45.510> big<00:02:45.780> fan<00:02:46.080> of<00:02:46.110> just<00:02:46.350> one<00:02:46.709> big<00:02:47.610> plain<00:02:48.030> you

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:48.989 
not a big fan of just one big plain you

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:52.400 
not a big fan of just one big plain you
alter<00:02:49.470> marine<00:02:49.680> symbol<00:02:50.840> takes<00:02:51.840> away<00:02:52.110> from<00:02:52.140> the

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
alter marine symbol takes away from the

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:55.040 
alter marine symbol takes away from the
detail<00:02:52.800> of<00:02:52.980> the<00:02:53.070> model<00:02:53.510> but<00:02:54.510> if<00:02:54.600> you<00:02:54.690> actually

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050 
detail of the model but if you actually

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:58.280 
detail of the model but if you actually
stack<00:02:55.440> more<00:02:55.800> detail<00:02:56.310> on<00:02:56.489> top<00:02:56.730> of<00:02:56.910> it<00:02:57.060> it<00:02:58.050> makes

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
stack more detail on top of it it makes

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.800 
stack more detail on top of it it makes
the<00:02:59.150> miniature<00:03:00.150> look<00:03:00.480> that<00:03:00.660> much<00:03:00.780> more

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
the miniature look that much more

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:05.150 
the miniature look that much more
realistic<00:03:01.410> if<00:03:01.830> you<00:03:01.950> asked<00:03:02.220> me<00:03:04.040> pigments<00:03:05.040> were

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
realistic if you asked me pigments were

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.610 
realistic if you asked me pigments were
used<00:03:05.370> on<00:03:05.550> the<00:03:05.610> wheels<00:03:06.000> and<00:03:06.540> the<00:03:07.020> bottom<00:03:07.380> and

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
used on the wheels and the bottom and

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.350 
used on the wheels and the bottom and
they<00:03:07.770> were<00:03:07.890> sealed<00:03:08.220> with<00:03:08.489> a<00:03:08.550> mix<00:03:08.940> of<00:03:09.120> matte

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:37.350 
pain that's been there for a while but

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:40.759 
pain that's been there for a while but
yeah<00:03:37.769> it<00:03:38.810> sits<00:03:39.810> down<00:03:40.049> on<00:03:40.110> the<00:03:40.260> model<00:03:40.590> quite

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:40.769 
yeah it sits down on the model quite

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:43.610 
yeah it sits down on the model quite
well<00:03:41.070> and<00:03:41.610> it's<00:03:42.390> fairly<00:03:42.630> cheap<00:03:42.959> actually<00:03:43.260> the

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
well and it's fairly cheap actually the

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:47.030 
well and it's fairly cheap actually the
gloss<00:03:44.070> varnish<00:03:44.280> I<00:03:44.670> think<00:03:44.910> Vallejo<00:03:46.040> Vallejo

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
gloss varnish I think Vallejo Vallejo

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.250 
gloss varnish I think Vallejo Vallejo
and<00:03:47.510> the<00:03:48.510> matte<00:03:48.810> varnish

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
and the matte varnish

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:55.490 
and the matte varnish
it's<00:03:49.890> about<00:03:50.100> 225<00:03:50.640> to<00:03:51.000> 60<00:03:51.390> mil<00:03:53.870> so<00:03:54.870> that<00:03:55.260> does

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
it's about 225 to 60 mil so that does
