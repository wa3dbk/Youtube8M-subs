00:01:58.539 --> 00:01:58.549 
or whatever to keep me entertained but

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:02.149 
or whatever to keep me entertained but
yeah<00:01:59.549> or<00:02:00.180> you<00:02:00.960> can<00:02:01.140> choose<00:02:01.170> the<00:02:01.469> second<00:02:02.040> one

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
yeah or you can choose the second one

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:07.449 
yeah or you can choose the second one
which<00:02:02.610> is<00:02:02.790> a<00:02:03.180> i<00:02:03.869> could<00:02:04.860> do<00:02:05.009> a<00:02:05.960> adventure<00:02:06.960> map

00:02:07.449 --> 00:02:07.459 
which is a i could do a adventure map

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:10.160 
which is a i could do a adventure map
again<00:02:08.459> with<00:02:08.700> me<00:02:08.910> or<00:02:09.090> with<00:02:09.390> somebody<00:02:09.660> else<00:02:09.929> I

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
again with me or with somebody else I

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.690 
again with me or with somebody else I
was<00:02:10.619> thinking<00:02:11.039> doing

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
was thinking doing

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.119 
was thinking doing
dual<00:02:11.940> comes<00:02:12.270> with<00:02:12.510> somebody<00:02:12.900> else<00:02:13.080> on<00:02:13.410> this

00:02:14.119 --> 00:02:14.129 
dual comes with somebody else on this

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:16.339 
dual comes with somebody else on this
adventure<00:02:14.910> map<00:02:15.060> I<00:02:15.239> have<00:02:15.390> some<00:02:15.599> cool<00:02:15.810> adventure

00:02:16.339 --> 00:02:16.349 
adventure map I have some cool adventure

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:18.949 
adventure map I have some cool adventure
maps<00:02:16.560> that<00:02:16.769> I<00:02:16.830> really<00:02:17.129> want<00:02:17.280> to<00:02:17.340> play<00:02:17.459> and<00:02:17.959> I

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
maps that I really want to play and I

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:21.550 
maps that I really want to play and I
might<00:02:19.260> just<00:02:19.410> do<00:02:19.620> those<00:02:19.830> no<00:02:20.370> matter<00:02:20.580> what<00:02:20.819> but

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
might just do those no matter what but

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.020 
might just do those no matter what but
if<00:02:22.560> you<00:02:22.680> guys<00:02:22.860> want<00:02:23.099> that<00:02:23.340> as<00:02:23.580> a<00:02:23.610> less<00:02:23.819> play

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
if you guys want that as a less play

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.300 
if you guys want that as a less play
than<00:02:24.209> let<00:02:24.420> me<00:02:24.510> know<00:02:26.209> or<00:02:27.209> the<00:02:27.540> third<00:02:27.569> suggestion

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
than let me know or the third suggestion

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:31.370 
than let me know or the third suggestion
suggestion<00:02:29.310> is<00:02:29.580> probably<00:02:30.330> the<00:02:31.170> most

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
suggestion is probably the most

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.759 
suggestion is probably the most
interesting<00:02:32.010> one<00:02:32.160> it's<00:02:33.290> about<00:02:34.290> the<00:02:34.470> server

00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:34.769 
interesting one it's about the server

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:37.820 
interesting one it's about the server
and<00:02:35.190> I<00:02:35.750> mentioned<00:02:36.750> in<00:02:36.870> my<00:02:36.900> previous<00:02:37.500> video

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
and I mentioned in my previous video

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:40.370 
and I mentioned in my previous video
that<00:02:38.010> the<00:02:38.970> server<00:02:39.269> is<00:02:39.390> going<00:02:39.480> to<00:02:39.720> be<00:02:39.870> launched

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
that the server is going to be launched

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:46.100 
that the server is going to be launched
when<00:02:41.000> one<00:02:42.000> point<00:02:42.330> 10<00:02:42.599> is<00:02:42.780> out<00:02:42.930> or<00:02:44.840> perhaps<00:02:45.840> one

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
when one point 10 is out or perhaps one

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:49.670 
when one point 10 is out or perhaps one
the<00:02:46.290> adventure<00:02:46.680> maps<00:02:48.140> adventure<00:02:49.140> update<00:02:49.500> is

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
the adventure maps adventure update is

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.759 
the adventure maps adventure update is
finished<00:02:50.130> which<00:02:50.370> is<00:02:50.579> 1.8<00:02:51.510> 1.9<00:02:52.230> at<00:02:52.440> one<00:02:52.560> point

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:52.769 
finished which is 1.8 1.9 at one point

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:56.110 
finished which is 1.8 1.9 at one point
10<00:02:53.069> we'll<00:02:53.280> see<00:02:53.489> but<00:02:54.239> for<00:02:54.450> that<00:02:54.480> I<00:02:54.630> need<00:02:54.780> a<00:02:54.989> map

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
10 we'll see but for that I need a map

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.620 
10 we'll see but for that I need a map
now<00:02:57.120> I<00:02:57.150> was<00:02:57.540> thinking<00:02:57.989> that<00:02:58.019> I<00:02:58.349> could<00:02:59.569> create<00:03:00.569> a

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
now I was thinking that I could create a

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:04.850 
now I was thinking that I could create a
server<00:03:01.310> where<00:03:02.310> me<00:03:03.209> and<00:03:03.239> other<00:03:03.780> people<00:03:04.200> work<00:03:04.590> on

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
server where me and other people work on

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:07.430 
server where me and other people work on
building<00:03:05.069> the<00:03:05.310> map<00:03:05.610> because<00:03:06.000> I<00:03:06.390> don't<00:03:07.230> want<00:03:07.260> to

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
building the map because I don't want to

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.559 
building the map because I don't want to
come<00:03:07.590> or<00:03:08.040> finish<00:03:08.430> the<00:03:08.610> entire<00:03:08.880> map<00:03:09.180> before<00:03:09.390> I

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:09.569 
come or finish the entire map before I

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:12.140 
come or finish the entire map before I
launch<00:03:09.840> the<00:03:10.140> server<00:03:10.410> but<00:03:10.739> I<00:03:10.980> want<00:03:11.610> to<00:03:11.940> have

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
launch the server but I want to have

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.300 
launch the server but I want to have
like<00:03:12.450> the<00:03:12.690> main<00:03:12.959> city<00:03:13.290> ready<00:03:13.590> so<00:03:13.920> that<00:03:13.950> people

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
like the main city ready so that people

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:16.340 
like the main city ready so that people
could<00:03:14.489> move<00:03:14.760> in<00:03:14.970> then<00:03:15.420> eventually<00:03:15.660> move<00:03:16.139> out

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350 
could move in then eventually move out

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:19.849 
could move in then eventually move out
to<00:03:17.239> somewhere<00:03:18.239> else<00:03:18.299> explore<00:03:19.109> the<00:03:19.139> world<00:03:19.380> make

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:19.859 
to somewhere else explore the world make

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:22.879 
to somewhere else explore the world make
your<00:03:20.130> own<00:03:20.250> cities<00:03:20.609> whatever<00:03:21.530> so<00:03:22.530> I<00:03:22.560> want<00:03:22.799> the

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:22.889 
your own cities whatever so I want the

00:03:22.889 --> 00:03:25.430 
your own cities whatever so I want the
main<00:03:23.100> city<00:03:23.400> to<00:03:23.639> be<00:03:23.850> done<00:03:24.060> perhaps<00:03:24.930> the<00:03:25.049> railway

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
main city to be done perhaps the railway

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:29.150 
main city to be done perhaps the railway
system<00:03:25.950> or<00:03:26.250> something<00:03:26.489> like<00:03:26.579> that<00:03:26.639> and<00:03:27.650> I<00:03:28.650> want

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
system or something like that and I want

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.580 
system or something like that and I want
a<00:03:29.340> cool<00:03:29.639> spawn<00:03:30.030> so<00:03:30.989> that's<00:03:31.200> why<00:03:31.380> I<00:03:31.410> was

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
a cool spawn so that's why I was

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.020 
a cool spawn so that's why I was
thinking<00:03:32.010> maybe<00:03:32.130> I<00:03:32.280> could<00:03:32.310> bring<00:03:32.609> some<00:03:32.819> other

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
thinking maybe I could bring some other

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:36.650 
thinking maybe I could bring some other
people<00:03:33.329> to<00:03:33.840> the<00:03:33.930> server<00:03:35.239> possibly<00:03:36.239> do<00:03:36.420> dual

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660 
people to the server possibly do dual

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:39.289 
people to the server possibly do dual
comps<00:03:37.170> and<00:03:37.319> just<00:03:37.530> build<00:03:37.739> on<00:03:37.980> the<00:03:38.069> server<00:03:38.310> to

00:03:39.289 --> 00:03:39.299 
comps and just build on the server to

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:42.080 
comps and just build on the server to
prepare<00:03:39.750> the<00:03:39.900> map<00:03:40.109> I<00:03:40.440> think<00:03:40.829> this<00:03:40.980> one<00:03:41.190> is<00:03:41.220> more

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
prepare the map I think this one is more

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:44.270 
prepare the map I think this one is more
interesting<00:03:42.660> than<00:03:42.690> the<00:03:42.989> first<00:03:43.230> one<00:03:43.470> so<00:03:44.130> I<00:03:44.160> was

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
interesting than the first one so I was

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.400 
interesting than the first one so I was
thinking<00:03:44.430> maybe<00:03:44.760> I<00:03:44.940> could<00:03:45.000> do<00:03:45.329> adventure<00:03:46.260> map

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
thinking maybe I could do adventure map

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:48.440 
thinking maybe I could do adventure map
with<00:03:46.590> someone<00:03:46.889> else<00:03:47.069> and<00:03:47.370> in<00:03:47.910> addition<00:03:48.060> to

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450 
with someone else and in addition to

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:50.860 
with someone else and in addition to
that<00:03:48.630> I<00:03:48.660> could<00:03:48.989> do<00:03:49.170> the<00:03:49.620> less<00:03:49.799> play<00:03:50.040> thing<00:03:50.280> or

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:50.870 
that I could do the less play thing or

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:55.550 
that I could do the less play thing or
the<00:03:51.870> server<00:03:52.650> thing<00:03:52.920> I<00:03:53.040> just<00:03:53.220> mentioned<00:03:54.560> but

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
the server thing I just mentioned but

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.379 
the server thing I just mentioned but
that's<00:03:55.739> it<00:03:56.069> I'm<00:03:56.340> finished<00:03:56.849> with<00:03:56.940> the<00:03:57.090> map<00:03:57.239> now

00:03:57.379 --> 00:03:57.389 
that's it I'm finished with the map now

00:03:57.389 --> 00:04:01.430 
that's it I'm finished with the map now
here's<00:03:58.260> the<00:03:58.440> goal<00:03:58.730> my<00:03:59.730> goal<00:03:59.760> was<00:04:00.180> to<00:04:00.440> BG

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 
here's the goal my goal was to BG

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:03.259 
here's the goal my goal was to BG
Treecko<00:04:01.859> because<00:04:02.190> that's<00:04:02.400> where<00:04:02.549> I<00:04:02.579> saw<00:04:02.849> this

00:04:03.259 --> 00:04:03.269 
Treecko because that's where I saw this

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:04.849 
Treecko because that's where I saw this
map<00:04:03.510> for<00:04:03.720> the<00:04:03.810> first<00:04:04.019> time<00:04:04.200> I<00:04:04.260> watched<00:04:04.590> his

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:04.859 
map for the first time I watched his
