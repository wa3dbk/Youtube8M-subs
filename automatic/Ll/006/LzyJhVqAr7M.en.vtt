00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
someone but I'm sure it's going to work

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.540 
someone but I'm sure it's going to work
with<00:00:39.210> the<00:00:39.450> with<00:00:40.290> the<00:00:40.320> normal<00:00:40.890> version<00:00:41.100> or<00:00:41.520> the

with the with the normal version or the
sweeper<00:00:42.210> arm<00:00:42.680> so<00:00:43.680> basically<00:00:44.010> we<00:00:44.190> have<00:00:44.250> this

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
sweeper arm so basically we have this

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.200 
sweeper arm so basically we have this
penske<00:00:45.270> here<00:00:45.510> it<00:00:45.690> comes<00:00:45.960> with<00:00:46.260> a<00:00:47.000> witch<00:00:48.000> imma

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
penske here it comes with a witch imma

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.020 
penske here it comes with a witch imma
call<00:00:48.390> it<00:00:48.660> a<00:00:48.960> extended<00:00:49.620> mag<00:00:49.829> right<00:00:50.550> off<00:00:50.700> the<00:00:50.850> bat

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.409 
where our team was a hundred and the
other<00:04:17.380> team<00:04:17.680> at<00:04:17.859> zero<00:04:18.250> so<00:04:18.940> in<00:04:19.180> the<00:04:19.299> beginning

00:04:19.409 --> 00:04:19.419 
other team at zero so in the beginning

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:21.029 
other team at zero so in the beginning
you<00:04:19.750> could<00:04:20.019> have<00:04:20.169> saw<00:04:20.380> I<00:04:20.590> was<00:04:20.829> actually

00:04:21.029 --> 00:04:21.039 
you could have saw I was actually

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:24.000 
you could have saw I was actually
playing<00:04:21.579> the<00:04:21.729> objective<00:04:22.000> a<00:04:22.630> lot<00:04:22.810> and

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:24.010 
playing the objective a lot and

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:26.340 
playing the objective a lot and
um<00:04:24.130> and<00:04:24.580> then<00:04:24.970> I<00:04:25.000> saw<00:04:25.450> that<00:04:25.690> our<00:04:25.870> team<00:04:26.110> was<00:04:26.320> a

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:26.350 
um and then I saw that our team was a

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:29.430 
um and then I saw that our team was a
hundred<00:04:26.830> and<00:04:26.980> oh<00:04:27.100> so<00:04:27.490> like<00:04:28.090> so<00:04:29.020> we<00:04:29.170> had<00:04:29.410> a

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:29.440 
hundred and oh so like so we had a

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:31.350 
hundred and oh so like so we had a
hundred<00:04:29.740> points<00:04:30.130> in<00:04:30.370> a<00:04:30.430> hard<00:04:30.640> point<00:04:30.850> and<00:04:31.150> the

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:31.360 
hundred points in a hard point and the

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:34.410 
hundred points in a hard point and the
other<00:04:31.450> team<00:04:31.900> had<00:04:32.110> zero<00:04:32.380> so<00:04:33.280> that<00:04:33.640> kind<00:04:34.090> of<00:04:34.180> just

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:34.420 
other team had zero so that kind of just

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:36.480 
other team had zero so that kind of just
occurred<00:04:35.050> to<00:04:35.080> me<00:04:35.290> that<00:04:35.410> the<00:04:35.770> team<00:04:36.280> was

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:36.490 
occurred to me that the team was

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:38.040 
occurred to me that the team was
probably<00:04:36.910> thinking<00:04:37.120> they<00:04:37.420> were<00:04:37.480> plagued<00:04:37.780> like

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:38.050 
probably thinking they were plagued like

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:40.920 
probably thinking they were plagued like
team<00:04:38.290> deathmatch<00:04:38.770> or<00:04:38.950> something<00:04:39.400> or<00:04:40.270> they

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:40.930 
team deathmatch or something or they

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:43.170 
team deathmatch or something or they
just<00:04:40.960> really<00:04:41.470> sucked<00:04:41.710> at<00:04:41.860> this<00:04:42.010> game<00:04:42.160> then<00:04:43.150> I

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:43.180 
just really sucked at this game then I

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:45.120 
just really sucked at this game then I
just<00:04:43.480> kind<00:04:43.690> of<00:04:43.840> stopped<00:04:44.230> playing<00:04:44.950> the

just kind of stopped playing the

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:47.220

aren't really supposed to be in super la
grange<00:06:07.660> so<00:06:07.840> I<00:06:07.870> kind<00:06:08.170> of<00:06:08.260> just<00:06:08.440> stay<00:06:08.680> away<00:06:08.980> from

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:09.810 
grange so I kind of just stay away from

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:12.630 
grange so I kind of just stay away from
long<00:06:10.810> ranges<00:06:11.290> I'd<00:06:11.500> kind<00:06:11.800> of<00:06:11.860> go<00:06:12.010> to<00:06:12.070> the<00:06:12.430> boat

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:12.640 
long ranges I'd kind of go to the boat

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:15.770 
long ranges I'd kind of go to the boat
close<00:06:13.120> up<00:06:13.420> or<00:06:13.690> if<00:06:14.350> you<00:06:14.590> have<00:06:14.770> to<00:06:15.010> be<00:06:15.220> do<00:06:15.370> bridges

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:15.780 
close up or if you have to be do bridges
