00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.329
 A) Yes 

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:11.070
 who is mono torrent sv wankel de 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:14.580
 the 60s a German engine here we see 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:17.420
 the side view that uses two days for 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.769
 each rotor uses 4 gigas two rotors 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:22.530
 We remember that this engine does not use 

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:24.480
 pistons does not use a rotor in the form of 

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:27.060
 triangle that we will see later the 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.220
 front view water pump a 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.830
 dealer here the name of the mission 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.320
 escape is the rotor spinning inside the 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:37.220
 helmet and you can touch the apex seal 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:41.690
 or top seal that controls the passage 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:41.690
 between one and another combustion chamber 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:52.470
 the rear of the steering wheel and stop 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:56.590
 leave already disarmed admission 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:59.530
 a small vacuum pipe 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:01.780
 attached to this accelerating body that whisk 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:05.830
 at the same time the unit also to the helmet to the 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:07.690
 block there his body acceleration had to 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:10.960
 be eliminated because it uses a 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:14.020
 fixed jet webber carburetor and for 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:16.380
 simplify it let's change it for a 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:16.380
 carburetor 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:25.300
 I give and chrysler like the one you see 

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:27.730
 with one of two mouths 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:29.890
 and it's easier for us to do it 

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:34.900
 turn on the used distributor here 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:36.820
 platinums because it uses two spark plugs 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:39.400
 for each rotor here the lid of 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:43.030
 distribution the turrets for the two 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:47.190
 coils and the four days two for each 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:50.470
 rotor every 90 degrees this double rotor 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:51.820
 thrown sparks at a time and his life 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:53.530
 normal 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:56.500
 here beans seem to be so 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:58.740
 work because combustion has something 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.700
 of oil in the rotor to lubricate it 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.600
 similar to the times here we are going to 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:07.990
 explain how the helmet works here 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:11.200
 or the pi track was ideal 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:15.099
 and the rotating rotor and alves way 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:18.730
 because the stamps sits on this 

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:21.150
 ideal trick pi surface that is like 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:23.220
 an 8 flat 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.730
 for many good times he received a 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.730
 oil pump 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:32.220
 the stamp 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:34.090
 lateral I had anterior and posterior 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:37.260
 two faces 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:41.069
 and we place the spring 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:45.319
 so that it maintains a pressure on the 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:45.319
 separator plate of this rotor 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:54.090
 these seals we had to manufacture the 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:56.070
 them with carbon steel since 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:59.550
 it's hard to get this kind of 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:01.260
 spare parts given by the year of this engine 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:05.870
 and the brand because it's not like here 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:08.239
 we have the seal of oil 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:12.409
 so that the eccentric does not pass 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:15.950
 camera and as always here we place 

00:03:12.409 --> 00:03:18.710
 the side seals and now the seal of 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:22.070
 apex help from simao 

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:25.890
 with its spring to keep pressure 

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:27.660
 on the hello track 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:31.590
 box 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:32.640
 epic block vidal here a wedge also 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:35.120
 so that it seals the compression 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:35.120
 sideways 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:41.310
 but of course as it is 

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:52.010
 and here come ice 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:52.010
 from the rotor 

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:59.570
 then the helmets track the crisis 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:03.020
 internally loving two parts already 

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:05.320
 conclude the assembly process of this 

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:05.320
 engine 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:17.430
 how curious it becomes in life when 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:19.590
 one look and think imagine 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:23.060
 aguilar 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:23.060
 with the camp and I had it 

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:54.480
 active 

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:54.480
 with the cable the pipe 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:01.500
 do not 

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:12.169
