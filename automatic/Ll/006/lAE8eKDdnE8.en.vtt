00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:02.580 
hey guys CT stealth here and this is

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:04.910 
hey guys CT stealth here and this is
introduction<00:00:03.270> to<00:00:03.389> 3d<00:00:03.659> effects<00:00:04.140> when<00:00:04.680> I<00:00:04.770> mean

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:04.920 
introduction to 3d effects when I mean

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.730 
introduction to 3d effects when I mean
walking<00:00:05.190> you<00:00:05.430> through<00:00:05.460> how<00:00:06.000> to<00:00:06.029> create<00:00:06.740> an

walking you through how to create an

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.749 
walking you through how to create an
explosion<00:00:08.099> in<00:00:08.550> like<00:00:08.760> a<00:00:08.790> scene<00:00:09.420> and<00:00:10.490> this<00:00:11.490> is

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
explosion in like a scene and this is

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
up my scene we utilize so i'm going to

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.160 
up my scene we utilize so i'm going to
come<00:00:35.760> over<00:00:35.820> here<00:00:35.940> to<00:00:36.090> the<00:00:36.300> perspective<00:00:36.960> view

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
come over here to the perspective view

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.270 
come over here to the perspective view
and<00:00:37.550> kind<00:00:38.550> of<00:00:38.640> show<00:00:38.820> you<00:00:38.879> what<00:00:39.300> I've<00:00:39.420> done<00:00:40.280> this

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
here is the image point it's being

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.290 
here is the image point it's being
projected<00:00:44.510> by<00:00:45.510> this<00:00:45.809> camera<00:00:46.230> over<00:00:46.770> here<00:00:46.800> and

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:47.300 
projected by this camera over here and

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.090 
projected by this camera over here and
to<00:00:48.300> do<00:00:48.420> that<00:00:48.450> I'm<00:00:48.870> going<00:00:49.050> to<00:00:49.170> go<00:00:49.710> to<00:00:49.770> the

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
to do that I'm going to go to the

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.910 
to do that I'm going to go to the
attribute<00:00:50.550> editor<00:00:50.670> and<00:00:51.059> go<00:00:51.629> down<00:00:51.750> to<00:00:51.809> its<00:00:52.800> the

attribute editor and go down to its the

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.610 
attribute editor and go down to its the
camera<00:00:53.190> shaped<00:00:53.449> environment<00:00:54.449> great<00:00:55.440> image

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
camera shaped environment great image

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.380 
camera shaped environment great image
plane<00:00:56.010> and<00:00:56.190> you<00:00:56.309> can<00:00:56.430> just<00:00:56.520> click<00:00:56.760> create<00:00:57.149> and

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
plane and you can just click create and

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.099 
plane and you can just click create and
then<00:00:58.460> can<00:00:59.460> scroll<00:01:00.090> down<00:01:00.300> to<00:01:00.539> the<00:01:00.570> image<00:01:00.870> name

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
then can scroll down to the image name

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.950 
then can scroll down to the image name
and<00:01:01.440> upload<00:01:02.129> your<00:01:02.370> image<00:01:02.850> then<00:01:03.719> you're<00:01:03.870> going

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
and upload your image then you're going

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.330 
and upload your image then you're going
to<00:01:04.019> have<00:01:04.080> to<00:01:04.290> position<00:01:04.559> your<00:01:04.860> camera<00:01:06.020> to<00:01:07.340> mimic

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
to have to position your camera to mimic

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.240 
to have to position your camera to mimic
the<00:01:08.810> perspectives<00:01:09.810> so<00:01:10.500> what<00:01:10.860> I've<00:01:10.979> done<00:01:11.189> here

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
the perspectives so what I've done here

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.899 
the perspectives so what I've done here
is<00:01:13.640> this<00:01:14.640> is<00:01:14.760> x-ray<00:01:15.090> mode<00:01:15.360> so<00:01:16.020> i<00:01:16.080> can<00:01:16.259> see<00:01:16.470> I

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:16.909 
is this is x-ray mode so i can see I

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:21.740 
is this is x-ray mode so i can see I
position<00:01:17.909> the<00:01:17.939> camera<00:01:18.299> so<00:01:18.780> that<00:01:19.100> lines<00:01:20.100> of<00:01:20.750> of

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
position the camera so that lines of of

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.460 
position the camera so that lines of of
the<00:01:22.140> plane<00:01:22.439> matched<00:01:23.100> the<00:01:24.000> streets<00:01:24.470> to

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
the plane matched the streets to

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.010 
the plane matched the streets to
represent<00:01:25.950> the<00:01:26.040> ground<00:01:26.280> I<00:01:26.600> use<00:01:27.600> that<00:01:27.630> by

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
represent the ground I use that by

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.749 
represent the ground I use that by
knowing<00:01:28.439> the<00:01:28.560> x-ray<00:01:29.070> and<00:01:29.400> I<00:01:29.460> can't

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
knowing the x-ray and I can't

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.510 
knowing the x-ray and I can't
unfortunately<00:01:30.689> I<00:01:31.049> can't<00:01:31.290> zoom<00:01:31.590> in<00:01:31.829> on<00:01:32.040> this

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
unfortunately I can't zoom in on this

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.010 
unfortunately I can't zoom in on this
camera<00:01:32.820> because<00:01:33.180> if<00:01:33.299> I<00:01:33.390> do<00:01:33.450> that<00:01:33.689> it's<00:01:33.900> going

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
camera because if I do that it's going

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.130 
camera because if I do that it's going
to<00:01:34.140> mess<00:01:34.259> up<00:01:34.439> my<00:01:35.090> under<00:01:36.090> section<00:01:36.659> it's<00:01:37.020> going

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
to mess up my under section it's going

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.730 
to mess up my under section it's going
to<00:01:37.200> move<00:01:37.320> the<00:01:37.650> image<00:01:37.890> plane<00:01:38.479> so<00:01:39.479> so<00:01:40.290> like<00:01:40.500> say

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
to move the image plane so so like say

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.980 
to move the image plane so so like say
if<00:01:40.950> I<00:01:41.040> just<00:01:41.250> move<00:01:41.430> the<00:01:42.090> damage<00:01:42.600> point<00:01:42.840> moves<00:01:43.280> so

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:44.990 
if I just move the damage point moves so

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:49.910 
if I just move the damage point moves so
well<00:01:45.990> I<00:01:47.390> just<00:01:48.390> done<00:01:48.750> did<00:01:48.899> it<00:01:48.930> but<00:01:49.290> that's<00:01:49.710> all

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
well I just done did it but that's all

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.520 
well I just done did it but that's all
right<00:01:49.950> now<00:01:50.189> I<00:01:50.220> still<00:01:50.970> have<00:01:51.090> the<00:01:51.180> saved<00:01:51.530> so

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
right now I still have the saved so

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.130 
right now I still have the saved so
anyway<00:01:52.979> um<00:01:54.200> let<00:01:55.200> me<00:01:55.259> just<00:01:55.320> open<00:01:55.560> that<00:01:55.770> back<00:01:56.070> up

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.140 
anyway um let me just open that back up

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.530 
anyway um let me just open that back up
real<00:01:58.140> fast<00:01:58.490> don't<00:01:59.490> see

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:01.540 
real fast don't see

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:05.370 
real fast don't see
all<00:02:02.290> right<00:02:02.440> then<00:02:02.680> so<00:02:03.460> as<00:02:03.760> you<00:02:04.240> can<00:02:04.360> see<00:02:04.540> the

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380 
all right then so as you can see the

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:08.940 
all right then so as you can see the
image<00:02:05.890> plane<00:02:06.720> let<00:02:07.720> me<00:02:07.810> turn<00:02:08.229> off<00:02:08.290> the<00:02:08.560> x-ray<00:02:08.890> so

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 
image plane let me turn off the x-ray so

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:11.640 
image plane let me turn off the x-ray so
you<00:02:09.100> can<00:02:09.190> see<00:02:09.310> it<00:02:09.430> better<00:02:09.550> think<00:02:10.540> the<00:02:11.200> what<00:02:11.620> I

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
you can see it better think the what I

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.120 
you can see it better think the what I
use<00:02:11.890> is<00:02:12.190> was<00:02:12.580> these<00:02:12.820> little<00:02:13.740> the<00:02:14.740> edges<00:02:15.100> of

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 
use is was these little the edges of

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:17.460 
use is was these little the edges of
this<00:02:15.370> image<00:02:15.730> point<00:02:16.000> they<00:02:16.570> follow<00:02:17.050> along

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
this image point they follow along

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.010 
this image point they follow along
straight<00:02:18.100> down<00:02:18.340> here<00:02:18.610> and<00:02:18.810> normally<00:02:19.810> I<00:02:19.870> would

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:20.020 
straight down here and normally I would

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:21.330 
straight down here and normally I would
have<00:02:20.110> this<00:02:20.230> bigger<00:02:20.470> resolution<00:02:20.740> and<00:02:21.280> you

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
have this bigger resolution and you

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:22.740 
have this bigger resolution and you
later<00:02:21.670> seen<00:02:21.910> the<00:02:22.060> rest<00:02:22.240> of<00:02:22.330> the<00:02:22.420> image<00:02:22.600> that

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
later seen the rest of the image that

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:27.420 
later seen the rest of the image that
comes<00:02:23.080> down<00:02:23.440> here<00:02:23.820> but<00:02:24.820> I<00:02:26.010> can<00:02:27.010> I<00:02:27.040> can't

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
comes down here but I can I can't

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.730 
comes down here but I can I can't
because<00:02:27.640> I'm<00:02:28.090> reducing<00:02:28.720> the<00:02:28.930> resolution<00:02:29.530> for

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:29.740 
because I'm reducing the resolution for

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:32.610 
because I'm reducing the resolution for
YouTube<00:02:30.520> purposes<00:02:31.000> so<00:02:31.930> just<00:02:32.230> kind<00:02:32.380> of<00:02:32.440> bear

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
YouTube purposes so just kind of bear

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.980 
YouTube purposes so just kind of bear
with<00:02:32.800> me<00:02:32.980> but<00:02:33.220> as<00:02:34.060> you<00:02:34.209> can<00:02:34.270> see<00:02:34.450> on<00:02:34.480> this<00:02:34.780> side

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:34.990 
with me but as you can see on this side

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:38.040 
with me but as you can see on this side
more<00:02:35.200> clearly<00:02:35.590> that<00:02:36.070> the<00:02:36.640> lines<00:02:36.880> are<00:02:37.180> almost

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:38.050 
more clearly that the lines are almost

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:40.949 
more clearly that the lines are almost
parallel<00:02:38.560> and<00:02:39.040> if<00:02:39.880> I<00:02:40.030> go<00:02:40.209> to<00:02:40.270> the<00:02:40.480> x-ray<00:02:40.900> you

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:40.959 
parallel and if I go to the x-ray you

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:43.560 
parallel and if I go to the x-ray you
can<00:02:41.260> kind<00:02:41.800> of<00:02:41.980> see<00:02:42.190> I'm<00:02:42.820> not<00:02:42.970> sure<00:02:43.240> how<00:02:43.390> well

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:43.570 
can kind of see I'm not sure how well

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:45.690 
can kind of see I'm not sure how well
this<00:02:43.750> will<00:02:43.930> show<00:02:44.110> up<00:02:44.230> on<00:02:44.380> YouTube<00:02:44.770> but<00:02:45.310> the

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
this will show up on YouTube but the

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.970 
this will show up on YouTube but the
lines<00:02:45.970> of<00:02:46.240> the<00:02:46.390> cube<00:02:46.660> here<00:02:46.990> match<00:02:47.350> the<00:02:47.740> sides

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
lines of the cube here match the sides

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:49.980 
lines of the cube here match the sides
of<00:02:48.160> the<00:02:48.250> building<00:02:48.370> that's<00:02:49.330> exactly<00:02:49.480> what<00:02:49.930> I

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:49.990 
of the building that's exactly what I

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
of the building that's exactly what I
want<00:02:50.320> I<00:02:50.530> want<00:02:51.070> to<00:02:51.370> use<00:02:52.240> these<00:02:52.420> cubes<00:02:52.900> here<00:02:53.290> to

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
want I want to use these cubes here to

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:58.830 
want I want to use these cubes here to
recreate<00:02:54.989> the<00:02:56.430> scene<00:02:57.430> and<00:02:57.730> I<00:02:58.239> don't<00:02:58.480> have<00:02:58.660> to

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
recreate the scene and I don't have to

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.180 
recreate the scene and I don't have to
make<00:02:58.959> it<00:02:59.170> as<00:02:59.290> detailed<00:02:59.800> as<00:03:00.010> these

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.190 
make it as detailed as these

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:02.100 
make it as detailed as these
architectures<00:03:00.880> are<00:03:01.000> because<00:03:01.630> you<00:03:01.780> can<00:03:01.930> see

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:02.110 
architectures are because you can see

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:03.870 
architectures are because you can see
here<00:03:02.380> in<00:03:02.500> this<00:03:02.590> image<00:03:02.860> that<00:03:03.550> there's<00:03:03.760> these

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:03.880 
here in this image that there's these

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.330 
here in this image that there's these
little<00:03:03.940> points<00:03:04.390> and<00:03:04.870> there's<00:03:05.830> this<00:03:05.950> huge

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340 
little points and there's this huge

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:09.240 
little points and there's this huge
triangle<00:03:07.150> so<00:03:07.510> that's<00:03:08.350> too<00:03:08.769> mean<00:03:08.890> that's<00:03:09.130> a

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250 
triangle so that's too mean that's a

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:12.540 
triangle so that's too mean that's a
cone<00:03:09.780> I'm<00:03:10.780> not<00:03:10.959> anywhere<00:03:11.470> near<00:03:11.530> the<00:03:11.860> camera<00:03:12.250> so

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:12.550 
cone I'm not anywhere near the camera so

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:14.430 
cone I'm not anywhere near the camera so
it's<00:03:13.090> not<00:03:13.300> going<00:03:13.450> to<00:03:13.540> be<00:03:13.630> a<00:03:13.660> scene<00:03:13.930> it's<00:03:14.080> bad

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:14.440 
it's not going to be a scene it's bad

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:17.280 
it's not going to be a scene it's bad
all<00:03:14.860> we<00:03:15.250> want<00:03:15.489> is<00:03:15.670> we<00:03:15.730> want<00:03:15.970> these<00:03:16.239> cubes<00:03:16.630> to

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.290 
all we want is we want these cubes to

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:20.130 
all we want is we want these cubes to
have<00:03:17.769> our<00:03:17.980> texture<00:03:18.400> on<00:03:18.610> them<00:03:18.820> so<00:03:19.570> you<00:03:19.630> need<00:03:20.049> to

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:20.140 
have our texture on them so you need to

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:23.449 
have our texture on them so you need to
make<00:03:20.170> sure<00:03:20.320> that<00:03:20.890> your<00:03:21.160> cubes<00:03:21.549> and<00:03:21.910> stuff<00:03:22.750> all

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
make sure that your cubes and stuff all

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:28.350 
make sure that your cubes and stuff all
line<00:03:24.459> up<00:03:25.470> with<00:03:26.519> with<00:03:27.519> your<00:03:27.700> projection<00:03:28.239> if

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:28.360 
line up with with your projection if

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.250 
line up with with your projection if
they<00:03:28.660> don't<00:03:28.900> if<00:03:29.200> it's<00:03:29.620> weird<00:03:30.010> they're

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
they don't if it's weird they're

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.870 
they don't if it's weird they're
strangely<00:03:32.260> space<00:03:32.560> your<00:03:33.160> projection<00:03:33.700> might

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:33.880 
strangely space your projection might

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.120 
strangely space your projection might
move<00:03:34.360> it<00:03:34.480> off<00:03:34.660> and<00:03:34.989> you<00:03:35.049> might<00:03:35.230> need<00:03:35.380> to<00:03:35.500> back

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:36.130 
move it off and you might need to back

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:39.600 
move it off and you might need to back
up<00:03:36.160> the<00:03:36.519> camera<00:03:36.940> or<00:03:37.450> move<00:03:37.630> it<00:03:37.750> forward<00:03:38.610> maybe

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:39.610 
up the camera or move it forward maybe

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:41.729 
up the camera or move it forward maybe
even<00:03:39.850> rotate<00:03:40.269> it<00:03:40.480> depending<00:03:40.900> on<00:03:41.019> how<00:03:41.140> bad<00:03:41.380> your

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:41.739 
even rotate it depending on how bad your

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:46.500 
even rotate it depending on how bad your
parallels<00:03:42.580> are<00:03:42.850> here<00:03:43.560> but<00:03:44.560> if<00:03:44.769> you<00:03:45.459> can<00:03:45.700> since

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:46.510 
parallels are here but if you can since

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:49.920 
parallels are here but if you can since
I<00:03:46.600> have<00:03:46.630> this<00:03:46.870> saved<00:03:47.280> I<00:03:48.280> can<00:03:48.970> manipulate<00:03:49.480> my

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:49.930 
I have this saved I can manipulate my

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:52.949 
I have this saved I can manipulate my
camera<00:03:50.410> if<00:03:50.590> I<00:03:51.310> move<00:03:51.580> if<00:03:52.330> I<00:03:52.510> want<00:03:52.720> to<00:03:52.810> move

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:52.959 
camera if I move if I want to move

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:57.449 
camera if I move if I want to move
everything<00:03:53.730> like<00:03:54.730> in<00:03:54.940> the<00:03:55.660> scene<00:03:55.959> up<00:03:56.459> I'm

00:03:57.449 --> 00:03:57.459 
everything like in the scene up I'm

00:03:57.459 --> 00:03:59.160 
everything like in the scene up I'm
gonna<00:03:57.610> actually<00:03:57.820> have<00:03:58.150> to<00:03:58.269> move<00:03:58.450> it<00:03:58.570> down<00:03:58.840> in

00:03:59.160 --> 00:03:59.170 
gonna actually have to move it down in

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:03.680 
gonna actually have to move it down in
this<00:03:59.680> so<00:04:00.370> because<00:04:01.150> like<00:04:01.709> it's<00:04:02.709> a<00:04:02.830> weird

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:03.690 
this so because like it's a weird

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:08.640 
this so because like it's a weird
parallax<00:04:04.690> kind<00:04:05.170> of<00:04:05.290> feel<00:04:06.150> I'm<00:04:07.150> not<00:04:07.390> I<00:04:07.690> have<00:04:08.620> a

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:08.650 
parallax kind of feel I'm not I have a

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:11.310 
parallax kind of feel I'm not I have a
hard<00:04:08.890> time<00:04:09.070> grasping<00:04:09.639> it<00:04:09.730> but<00:04:10.419> if<00:04:10.780> I<00:04:10.959> move<00:04:11.200> the

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:11.320 
hard time grasping it but if I move the

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:13.620 
hard time grasping it but if I move the
camera<00:04:11.560> here<00:04:11.950> everything<00:04:12.820> on<00:04:12.970> this<00:04:13.000> side<00:04:13.359> is

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:13.630 
camera here everything on this side is

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:15.300 
camera here everything on this side is
no<00:04:13.870> no<00:04:13.930> it's<00:04:14.500> reverse

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:15.310 
no no it's reverse

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:17.400 
no no it's reverse
whatever<00:04:15.700> I<00:04:15.790> do<00:04:15.940> here<00:04:16.329> so<00:04:16.870> if<00:04:16.930> I<00:04:17.019> move<00:04:17.260> the

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:17.410 
whatever I do here so if I move the

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:18.920 
whatever I do here so if I move the
camera<00:04:17.620> up<00:04:17.859> everything<00:04:18.549> will<00:04:18.730> move<00:04:18.850> down

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:18.930 
camera up everything will move down

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:21.509 
camera up everything will move down
above<00:04:19.930> the<00:04:19.989> camera<00:04:20.470> down<00:04:20.650> everything<00:04:21.489> will

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:21.519 
above the camera down everything will

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:24.030 
above the camera down everything will
move<00:04:21.760> up<00:04:21.940> same<00:04:22.840> thing<00:04:23.080> goes<00:04:23.110> with<00:04:23.320> turning<00:04:23.889> if

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:24.040 
move up same thing goes with turning if

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:25.950 
move up same thing goes with turning if
I<00:04:24.190> move<00:04:24.400> left<00:04:24.700> it<00:04:24.910> goes<00:04:25.060> right<00:04:25.330> and<00:04:25.540> if<00:04:25.660> I<00:04:25.810> move

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:25.960 
I move left it goes right and if I move

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:29.940 
I move left it goes right and if I move
right<00:04:26.169> it<00:04:26.380> goes<00:04:26.500> left<00:04:27.480> it's<00:04:28.800> it's<00:04:29.800> just

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:29.950 
right it goes left it's it's just

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:31.620 
right it goes left it's it's just
something<00:04:30.370> you<00:04:30.490> kind<00:04:30.639> of<00:04:30.760> get<00:04:30.910> used<00:04:30.970> to<00:04:31.330> as<00:04:31.480> you

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:31.630 
something you kind of get used to as you

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:35.760 
something you kind of get used to as you
do<00:04:31.750> and<00:04:33.030> so<00:04:34.030> basically<00:04:34.600> this<00:04:34.990> is<00:04:35.050> a<00:04:35.230> kind<00:04:35.650> of

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:35.770 
do and so basically this is a kind of

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:38.640 
do and so basically this is a kind of
the<00:04:35.889> setup<00:04:36.250> it<00:04:36.880> took<00:04:37.150> me<00:04:37.360> about<00:04:37.570> 45<00:04:37.960> minutes<00:04:38.350> to

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:38.650 
the setup it took me about 45 minutes to

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:40.920 
the setup it took me about 45 minutes to
get<00:04:38.770> this<00:04:38.950> right<00:04:39.280> so<00:04:40.000> if<00:04:40.419> you<00:04:40.570> don't<00:04:40.660> have<00:04:40.810> that

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:40.930 
get this right so if you don't have that

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:44.700 
get this right so if you don't have that
kind<00:04:41.139> of<00:04:41.200> time<00:04:41.350> I<00:04:41.669> try<00:04:42.669> to<00:04:42.700> try<00:04:43.389> to<00:04:43.450> make<00:04:43.720> make

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:44.710 
kind of time I try to try to make make

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:46.260 
kind of time I try to try to make make
sure<00:04:44.860> you<00:04:45.040> have<00:04:45.160> enough<00:04:45.370> time<00:04:45.610> to<00:04:45.669> fiddle

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:46.270 
sure you have enough time to fiddle

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:48.570 
sure you have enough time to fiddle
around<00:04:46.419> with<00:04:46.690> us<00:04:47.190> sometimes<00:04:48.190> they<00:04:48.310> can<00:04:48.430> take

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:48.580 
around with us sometimes they can take

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:50.190 
around with us sometimes they can take
longer<00:04:48.880> especially<00:04:49.180> if<00:04:49.570> you're<00:04:49.690> not<00:04:49.810> used<00:04:50.080> to

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:50.200 
longer especially if you're not used to

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:57.120 
longer especially if you're not used to
doing<00:04:50.350> this<00:04:51.270> but<00:04:53.430> basically<00:04:55.590> you<00:04:56.590> need<00:04:56.710> to<00:04:56.889> try

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:57.130 
doing this but basically you need to try

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:01.580 
doing this but basically you need to try
to<00:04:57.190> recreate<00:04:58.110> whatever<00:04:59.110> you're<00:04:59.410> going<00:04:59.590> to<00:05:00.070> I

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:01.590 
to recreate whatever you're going to I

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:05.250 
to recreate whatever you're going to I
guess<00:05:02.590> it<00:05:02.860> make<00:05:03.580> blow<00:05:03.940> up<00:05:04.180> so<00:05:04.600> like<00:05:04.750> if<00:05:04.900> I<00:05:05.020> want

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:05.260 
guess it make blow up so like if I want

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.170 
guess it make blow up so like if I want
this<00:05:05.440> building<00:05:05.860> to<00:05:05.950> blow<00:05:06.070> up<00:05:06.190> here<00:05:06.430> i'm<00:05:06.940> going

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:07.180 
this building to blow up here i'm going

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:09.150 
this building to blow up here i'm going
to<00:05:07.240> create<00:05:07.540> the<00:05:07.720> cubes<00:05:08.110> and<00:05:08.710> i'm<00:05:08.979> going<00:05:09.070> to

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:09.160 
to create the cubes and i'm going to

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:11.730 
to create the cubes and i'm going to
create<00:05:09.340> the<00:05:10.330> cubes<00:05:10.630> all<00:05:10.870> from<00:05:11.260> this<00:05:11.500> building

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:11.740 
create the cubes all from this building

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:14.670 
create the cubes all from this building
i<00:05:12.070> might<00:05:12.400> come<00:05:13.030> over<00:05:13.330> here<00:05:13.630> create<00:05:14.020> the<00:05:14.229> comb

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:14.680 
i might come over here create the comb

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:18.450 
i might come over here create the comb
here<00:05:15.220> and<00:05:15.630> make<00:05:16.630> this<00:05:16.660> cube<00:05:17.290> and<00:05:17.740> whatever

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:18.460 
here and make this cube and whatever

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:21.870 
here and make this cube and whatever
this<00:05:18.639> round<00:05:18.940> thing<00:05:19.030> is<00:05:19.360> a<00:05:19.539> cylinder<00:05:20.580> cube<00:05:21.580> here

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:21.880 
this round thing is a cylinder cube here

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:24.180 
this round thing is a cylinder cube here
and<00:05:22.060> then<00:05:22.960> that's<00:05:23.110> going<00:05:23.289> to<00:05:23.380> be<00:05:23.500> in<00:05:23.620> front<00:05:23.830> of

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:24.190 
and then that's going to be in front of

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:26.760 
and then that's going to be in front of
of<00:05:24.580> these<00:05:25.180> things<00:05:25.590> anything<00:05:26.590> that's

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:26.770 
of these things anything that's

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:30.330 
of these things anything that's
overlapping<00:05:27.280> this<00:05:27.669> building<00:05:28.740> will<00:05:29.740> need<00:05:30.070> a

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:30.340 
overlapping this building will need a

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:32.310 
overlapping this building will need a
cube<00:05:30.850> in<00:05:31.000> front<00:05:31.240> of<00:05:31.300> it<00:05:31.419> because<00:05:31.660> we<00:05:32.080> need<00:05:32.229> to

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:32.320 
cube in front of it because we need to

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:37.050 
cube in front of it because we need to
be<00:05:32.470> able<00:05:32.560> to<00:05:32.740> create<00:05:35.130> we<00:05:36.130> need<00:05:36.280> objects<00:05:36.880> to<00:05:36.940> go

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:37.060 
be able to create we need objects to go

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:39.029 
be able to create we need objects to go
behind<00:05:37.450> the<00:05:37.630> building<00:05:37.930> so<00:05:38.200> like<00:05:38.440> if<00:05:38.800> it

00:05:39.029 --> 00:05:39.039 
behind the building so like if it

00:05:39.039 --> 00:05:42.090 
behind the building so like if it
explodes<00:05:40.320> piece<00:05:41.320> of<00:05:41.470> debris<00:05:41.560> is<00:05:41.800> going<00:05:42.039> to

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:42.100 
explodes piece of debris is going to

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:43.560 
explodes piece of debris is going to
fall<00:05:42.310> behind<00:05:42.520> this<00:05:42.820> building<00:05:43.030> so<00:05:43.300> I<00:05:43.330> need<00:05:43.539> a

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:43.570 
fall behind this building so I need a

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:48.960 
fall behind this building so I need a
cube<00:05:43.960> there<00:05:44.229> in<00:05:44.470> order<00:05:45.160> to<00:05:45.870> UM<00:05:47.760> make<00:05:48.760> the

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:48.970 
cube there in order to UM make the

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:52.260 
cube there in order to UM make the
object<00:05:49.389> disappear<00:05:49.870> now<00:05:50.560> I'll<00:05:50.800> kind<00:05:51.070> of<00:05:51.270> kind

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:52.270 
object disappear now I'll kind of kind

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:55.379 
object disappear now I'll kind of kind
of<00:05:52.419> demonstrate<00:05:52.930> that<00:05:53.110> a<00:05:53.169> little<00:05:53.410> bit<00:05:54.210> if<00:05:55.210> I

00:05:55.379 --> 00:05:55.389 
of demonstrate that a little bit if I

00:05:55.389 --> 00:05:59.730 
of demonstrate that a little bit if I
can<00:05:56.160> not<00:05:57.160> to<00:05:57.280> go<00:05:57.370> to<00:05:57.460> perspective<00:05:58.530> so<00:05:59.530> i'll

00:05:59.730 --> 00:05:59.740 
can not to go to perspective so i'll

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:02.999 
can not to go to perspective so i'll
just<00:05:59.770> create<00:06:00.190> like<00:06:00.400> this

00:06:02.999 --> 00:06:03.009 

00:06:03.009 --> 00:06:07.709 

go<00:06:03.610> here<00:06:04.150> and<00:06:05.400> all<00:06:06.400> right<00:06:06.520> select<00:06:06.939> this<00:06:07.180> I'm

00:06:07.709 --> 00:06:07.719 
go here and all right select this I'm

00:06:07.719 --> 00:06:10.679 
go here and all right select this I'm
gonna<00:06:07.839> make<00:06:07.990> it<00:06:08.969> make<00:06:09.969> it<00:06:09.999> about<00:06:10.210> this<00:06:10.419> sighs<00:06:10.659> I

00:06:10.679 --> 00:06:10.689 
gonna make it make it about this sighs I

00:06:10.689 --> 00:06:13.889 
gonna make it make it about this sighs I
mean<00:06:11.020> that's<00:06:11.110> a<00:06:11.259> big<00:06:11.499> chunk<00:06:11.800> of<00:06:11.979> debris<00:06:12.399> but<00:06:13.180> if

00:06:13.889 --> 00:06:13.899 
mean that's a big chunk of debris but if

00:06:13.899 --> 00:06:17.040 
mean that's a big chunk of debris but if
this<00:06:14.740> is<00:06:14.800> the<00:06:15.059> building<00:06:16.059> I<00:06:16.240> need<00:06:16.479> to<00:06:16.569> go<00:06:16.809> behind

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:17.050 
this is the building I need to go behind

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:20.159 
this is the building I need to go behind
the<00:06:17.469> building<00:06:17.770> so<00:06:18.339> that's<00:06:18.550> why<00:06:18.729> the<00:06:19.119> cute<00:06:19.360> the

00:06:20.159 --> 00:06:20.169 
the building so that's why the cute the

00:06:20.169 --> 00:06:21.929 
the building so that's why the cute the
cube<00:06:20.439> will<00:06:20.649> define<00:06:21.069> the<00:06:21.219> edges<00:06:21.249> of<00:06:21.550> the<00:06:21.669> pillow

00:06:21.929 --> 00:06:21.939 
cube will define the edges of the pillow

00:06:21.939 --> 00:06:25.950 
cube will define the edges of the pillow
and<00:06:22.180> we<00:06:22.599> can<00:06:22.749> do<00:06:22.899> this<00:06:23.080> by<00:06:23.319> placing<00:06:23.550> a<00:06:24.960> texture

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:25.960 
and we can do this by placing a texture

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:29.790 
and we can do this by placing a texture
will<00:06:26.889> we<00:06:27.520> use<00:06:27.550> the<00:06:28.119> used<00:06:28.809> background<00:06:29.469> cheater

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:29.800 
will we use the used background cheater

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:32.999 
will we use the used background cheater
texture<00:06:30.369> which<00:06:30.819> basically<00:06:31.589> what<00:06:32.589> it<00:06:32.619> does<00:06:32.710> is

00:06:32.999 --> 00:06:33.009 
texture which basically what it does is

00:06:33.009 --> 00:06:35.249 
texture which basically what it does is
it<00:06:33.039> just<00:06:33.389> replicates<00:06:34.389> any<00:06:34.599> texture<00:06:35.080> that's

00:06:35.249 --> 00:06:35.259 
it just replicates any texture that's

00:06:35.259 --> 00:06:39.179 
it just replicates any texture that's
behind<00:06:35.529> it<00:06:35.830> and<00:06:36.300> makes<00:06:37.300> it<00:06:37.449> its<00:06:37.629> own<00:06:37.809> and<00:06:38.189> we'll

00:06:39.179 --> 00:06:39.189 
behind it and makes it its own and we'll

00:06:39.189 --> 00:06:42.149 
behind it and makes it its own and we'll
need<00:06:39.339> to<00:06:39.550> like<00:06:39.759> Soloff<00:06:40.330> I<00:06:40.479> that<00:06:40.809> so<00:06:41.589> I'm<00:06:41.889> I'll

00:06:42.149 --> 00:06:42.159 
need to like Soloff I that so I'm I'll

00:07:23.969 --> 00:07:23.979 
to be talking about rigid bodies because

00:07:23.979 --> 00:07:29.480

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:29.490 
we need to be able to create pieces of

00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:32.699 
we need to be able to create pieces of
debris<00:07:30.490> to<00:07:31.029> kind<00:07:31.269> of<00:07:31.330> like<00:07:31.449> chunk<00:07:32.229> forward

00:07:32.699 --> 00:07:32.709 
debris to kind of like chunk forward

00:07:32.709 --> 00:07:35.790 
debris to kind of like chunk forward
like<00:07:32.949> huge<00:07:33.459> chunks<00:07:33.999> so<00:07:34.749> we<00:07:34.930> use<00:07:35.169> a<00:07:35.199> rigid

00:07:35.790 --> 00:07:35.800 
like huge chunks so we use a rigid

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:38.639 
like huge chunks so we use a rigid
bodies<00:07:36.099> to<00:07:36.219> do<00:07:36.370> so<00:07:36.610> so<00:07:37.050> i'll<00:07:38.050> see<00:07:38.259> you<00:07:38.439> next
