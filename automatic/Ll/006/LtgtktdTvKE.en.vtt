all you're kind of looking for so we're

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.030 
all you're kind of looking for so we're
going<00:02:15.420> to<00:02:15.569> try<00:02:15.840> and<00:02:15.870> get<00:02:16.200> this<00:02:16.319> dumped<00:02:16.739> into<00:02:16.890> a

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
going to try and get this dumped into a

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:22.400 
going to try and get this dumped into a
bowl<00:02:20.150> these<00:02:21.150> ones<00:02:21.269> are<00:02:21.420> really<00:02:21.599> nice<00:02:21.810> with<00:02:22.200> the

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
bowl these ones are really nice with the

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:23.809 
bowl these ones are really nice with the
dates<00:02:22.620> because<00:02:22.860> it<00:02:23.099> has<00:02:23.220> some<00:02:23.400> nice<00:02:23.519> date

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819

dates because it has some nice date
chunks<00:02:24.209> in<00:02:24.390> it<00:02:24.480> so<00:02:24.690> it<00:02:24.780> just<00:02:24.930> adds<00:02:25.110> a<00:02:25.290> little

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
chunks in it so it just adds a little

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:34.550 
chunks in it so it just adds a little
bit<00:02:25.560> extra<00:02:26.540> flavor<00:02:32.989> so<00:02:33.989> you<00:02:34.110> can<00:02:34.260> make<00:02:34.350> these

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
bit extra flavor so you can make these

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.320 
bit extra flavor so you can make these
into<00:02:34.799> little<00:02:35.130> balls<00:02:35.340> you<00:02:35.700> can<00:02:35.819> make<00:02:35.940> them<00:02:36.090> into

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
into little balls you can make them into

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.400 
into little balls you can make them into
bars<00:02:36.690> you<00:02:37.110> could<00:02:37.290> use<00:02:37.440> it<00:02:37.620> as<00:02:37.769> a<00:02:37.799> pie<00:02:38.400> crust

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:55.769 
you could just use a teaspoon if you

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:58.070
