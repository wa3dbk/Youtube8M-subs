need to do some stretches once we get

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:21.980 
need to do some stretches once we get
off<00:00:20.070> that<00:00:20.250> plane<00:00:20.310> how<00:00:21.119> many<00:00:21.330> times<00:00:21.660> do<00:00:21.960> you

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
more energy great way to get some energy

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.589 
more energy great way to get some energy
is<00:00:26.279> go<00:00:26.519> through<00:00:26.760> some<00:00:26.910> stretches<00:00:27.210> while

the spine this is going to bring that

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:15.770 
the spine this is going to bring that
energy<00:01:14.340> back<00:01:14.580> into<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:14.939> body<00:01:15.119> allow<00:01:15.509> you<00:01:15.570> to

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
sitting on the plane just in that little

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.880 
sitting on the plane just in that little
spot<00:01:21.420> there<00:01:21.689> we<00:01:22.140> want<00:01:22.320> to<00:01:22.380> get<00:01:22.500> a<00:01:22.530> little<00:01:22.710> bit

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
spot there we want to get a little bit

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.469 
spot there we want to get a little bit
of<00:01:22.979> leg<00:01:23.130> movement<00:01:23.369> obviously<00:01:23.759> there's<00:01:24.299> not

enough<00:01:24.810> legroom<00:01:25.080> to<00:01:25.470> bring<00:01:25.650> those<00:01:25.770> legs

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
enough legroom to bring those legs

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.070 
enough legroom to bring those legs
straight<00:01:26.220> out<00:01:26.520> but<00:01:27.180> you<00:01:27.270> can<00:01:27.509> start<00:01:27.900> by

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
straight out but you can start by

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.710
