it's<00:02:07.430> the<00:02:07.580> counterweight<00:02:08.060> for<00:02:08.270> the<00:02:08.330> screen<00:02:08.599> I

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:08.840 
it's the counterweight for the screen I

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.349 
it's the counterweight for the screen I
just<00:02:09.319> hang<00:02:09.500> it<00:02:09.649> on<00:02:09.770> the<00:02:09.890> screen<00:02:10.099> click<00:02:10.909> Next

monitors drift a lot also when you're
doing<00:02:44.840> this<00:02:44.959> make<00:02:45.379> sure<00:02:45.409> your<00:02:45.680> monitor<00:02:46.040> has

00:02:46.119 --> 00:02:46.129 
doing this make sure your monitor has

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:48.430 
doing this make sure your monitor has
been<00:02:46.250> on<00:02:46.370> at<00:02:46.489> least<00:02:46.640> an<00:02:46.819> hour<00:02:47.230> takes<00:02:48.230> an<00:02:48.379> hour

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
been on at least an hour takes an hour

for them to warm up and kind of

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:53.440 
for them to warm up and kind of
stabilize<00:02:50.209> so<00:02:51.170> after<00:02:51.500> I<00:02:51.530> got<00:02:51.709> my<00:02:51.889> profile<00:02:52.450> next

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
stabilize so after I got my profile next

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:55.300 
stabilize so after I got my profile next

time I'm in photoshop and photoshop says

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:57.190 
time I'm in photoshop and photoshop says
give<00:02:55.970> me<00:02:56.000> one<00:02:56.239> hundred<00:02:56.480> percent<00:02:56.510> green<00:02:56.930> on<00:02:57.109> the

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 
give me one hundred percent green on the

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.710 
give me one hundred percent green on the
screen<00:02:57.730> that<00:02:58.730> command<00:02:59.120> goes<00:02:59.329> through<00:02:59.599> the

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720 
screen that command goes through the

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.050 
screen that command goes through the
profile<00:03:00.200> which<00:03:00.440> is<00:03:00.590> like<00:03:00.709> a<00:03:00.739> filter<00:03:01.159> and<00:03:01.340> the

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
profile which is like a filter and the

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:04.360 
profile which is like a filter and the
profile<00:03:02.540> says<00:03:02.900> remember<00:03:03.560> if<00:03:03.680> you<00:03:03.709> really<00:03:04.159> want

profile says remember if you really want

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:05.619 
profile says remember if you really want
one<00:03:04.489> hundred<00:03:04.760> percent<00:03:04.790> green<00:03:05.150> on<00:03:05.299> the<00:03:05.389> screen

one hundred percent green on the screen

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:07.479 
one hundred percent green on the screen
you<00:03:05.780> got<00:03:05.870> to<00:03:05.989> take<00:03:06.170> out<00:03:06.379> ten<00:03:06.590> percent<00:03:06.859> blue<00:03:07.040> so

00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:07.489 
you got to take out ten percent blue so

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:09.039 
you got to take out ten percent blue so
now<00:03:07.609> let's<00:03:07.819> get<00:03:07.940> a<00:03:08.000> profile<00:03:08.450> for<00:03:08.599> our<00:03:08.720> printer

00:03:09.039 --> 00:03:09.049 
now let's get a profile for our printer

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:11.349 
now let's get a profile for our printer
so<00:03:09.379> I<00:03:09.409> choose<00:03:09.769> a<00:03:09.799> printer<00:03:10.370> any<00:03:10.819> printer<00:03:11.239> that

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:11.359 
so I choose a printer any printer that

00:03:11.359 --> 00:03:12.699 
so I choose a printer any printer that
you<00:03:11.450> have<00:03:11.629> installed<00:03:11.989> in<00:03:12.200> your<00:03:12.230> system<00:03:12.680> will

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:12.709 
you have installed in your system will

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:15.610 
you have installed in your system will
show<00:03:12.980> up<00:03:13.190> typical<00:03:13.909> you'll<00:03:14.060> name<00:03:14.329> it<00:03:14.569> for<00:03:15.470> the

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
show up typical you'll name it for the

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:17.830 
show up typical you'll name it for the
paper<00:03:15.859> you<00:03:16.040> need<00:03:16.250> a<00:03:16.340> profile<00:03:16.909> for<00:03:17.180> each<00:03:17.359> paper

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 
paper you need a profile for each paper

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:19.930 
paper you need a profile for each paper
you<00:03:18.199> use<00:03:18.440> so<00:03:18.919> it<00:03:19.040> tells<00:03:19.220> me<00:03:19.340> print<00:03:19.669> out<00:03:19.790> this

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:19.940 
you use so it tells me print out this

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:21.960 
you use so it tells me print out this
chart<00:03:20.299> so<00:03:20.750> I<00:03:20.780> go<00:03:20.989> to<00:03:21.049> my<00:03:21.230> print<00:03:21.530> settings

want<00:05:13.880> to<00:05:14.180> see<00:05:14.360> how<00:05:14.540> it's<00:05:14.720> going<00:05:14.840> to<00:05:14.900> print<00:05:15.169> so<00:05:16.100> I

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:16.130 
want to see how it's going to print so I

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:20.409 
want to see how it's going to print so I
go<00:05:16.550> to<00:05:16.610> my<00:05:17.139> device<00:05:18.139> to<00:05:18.350> simulate<00:05:18.860> and<00:05:19.150> I<00:05:20.150> tell

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:54.810 
and guess what happens the print comes
out<00:06:53.260> like<00:06:53.380> it<00:06:53.530> looked<00:06:53.680> on<00:06:53.770> the<00:06:53.890> monitor<00:06:54.250> thanks

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:54.820 
out like it looked on the monitor thanks
