damn thing about okay i have received my
new<00:00:25.109> phone<00:00:25.320> the<00:00:26.160> only<00:00:26.430> thing<00:00:26.609> that's

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
new phone the only thing that's

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.029 
new phone the only thing that's
different<00:00:26.910> about<00:00:27.269> it<00:00:27.480> the<00:00:27.930> only<00:00:28.170> three<00:00:28.830> things

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
different about it the only three things

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.229 
different about it the only three things
that's<00:00:29.369> different<00:00:29.460> about<00:00:29.849> it<00:00:30.890> this<00:00:32.000> the<00:00:33.000> back

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
that's different about it this the back

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.930 
that's different about it this the back
I<00:00:33.860> guess<00:00:34.860> that<00:00:34.890> makes<00:00:35.190> the<00:00:35.340> signal<00:00:35.700> a<00:00:35.730> little

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
I guess that makes the signal a little

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.880 
I guess that makes the signal a little
bit<00:00:36.059> better<00:00:36.149> and<00:00:36.360> I<00:00:36.420> have<00:00:36.540> noticed<00:00:36.840> a<00:00:36.989> sliver

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
bit better and I have noticed a sliver

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:45.369 
bit better and I have noticed a sliver
of<00:00:38.040> improvement<00:00:38.700> just<00:00:38.910> barely<00:00:40.940> it's<00:00:41.940> also<00:00:42.360> got

00:00:45.369 --> 00:00:45.379 

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:48.950 

the<00:00:46.379> only<00:00:46.680> other<00:00:46.829> thing<00:00:46.920> on<00:00:47.250> it<00:00:47.460> would<00:00:47.760> be<00:00:47.969> gps

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
the only other thing on it would be gps

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.750 
the only other thing on it would be gps
and<00:00:51.110> 3g<00:00:52.110> but<00:00:52.770> that<00:00:52.949> doesn't<00:00:53.250> matter<00:00:53.340> to<00:00:53.579> me<00:00:53.610> i

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
and 3g but that doesn't matter to me i

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.459 
and 3g but that doesn't matter to me i
don't<00:00:54.000> have<00:00:54.149> 3g<00:00:54.449> so<00:00:54.870> nothing's<00:00:55.260> really

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
don't have 3g so nothing's really

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.990 
don't have 3g so nothing's really
changed<00:00:55.879> except<00:00:56.879> gps<00:00:57.360> I<00:00:58.579> guess<00:00:59.579> the<00:00:59.730> sound

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
changed except gps I guess the sound

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.250 
changed except gps I guess the sound
quality<00:01:00.120> is<00:01:00.300> little<00:01:00.510> better<00:01:00.629> some<00:01:00.870> people<00:01:01.109> say

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
quality is little better some people say

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.510 
quality is little better some people say
the<00:01:01.379> video<00:01:01.590> quality<00:01:01.829> is<00:01:02.010> a<00:01:02.100> little<00:01:02.129> bit<00:01:02.399> better

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
the video quality is a little bit better

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:03.979 
the video quality is a little bit better
I<00:01:02.820> would<00:01:02.910> think<00:01:03.059> they<00:01:03.359> could<00:01:03.390> change<00:01:03.780> that

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
I would think they could change that

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.810 
I would think they could change that
with<00:01:04.229> just<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:04.860> software<00:01:05.430> i<00:01:05.460> don't<00:01:05.700> think

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
with just the software i don't think

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.640 
with just the software i don't think
they<00:01:05.939> changed<00:01:06.180> the<00:01:06.479> screen<00:01:06.869> they<00:01:07.200> just<00:01:07.409> change

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
they changed the screen they just change

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.530 
they changed the screen they just change
the<00:01:07.770> software<00:01:08.220> so<00:01:08.820> other<00:01:09.060> people<00:01:09.150> have

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
the software so other people have

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.750 
the software so other people have
downloaded<00:01:09.689> the<00:01:10.020> two<00:01:10.260> point<00:01:10.500> of<00:01:10.619> software<00:01:11.159> for

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
downloaded the two point of software for

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.640 
downloaded the two point of software for
free<00:01:11.790> on<00:01:12.150> their<00:01:12.240> old<00:01:12.420> iphone<00:01:12.750> probably<00:01:13.170> enjoy
