00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:20.990
 hello friends how are you here is the 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:23.150
 his brother again for comments a 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:25.369
 gameplay for this beautiful channel that 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:26.810
 it's people and we're going to analyze a 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:28.939
 mode but that is not a mode but is a 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:31.490
 mode by will be a way of war 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:33.110
 terrestrial in which he offers us three 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:36.020
 different low game modes 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:38.660
 team and domain duel confirmed 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:41.340
 he what becomes the domain of the 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:44.250
 terrestrial and domain 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:46.440
 normal is equal to the same points 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.780
 which is all the same is confirmed to 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.809
 change to 65 confirmed casualties go to 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:54.390
 be 90 and in team idol they pass 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.700
 of 75 casualties per team is between 1500 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.500
 points become 10,000 vouchers the only 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:00.960
 small difference that we can find 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.940
 in these vouchers as you know the 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:07.049
 modality d 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:10.440
 of land war allows to play a 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:12.570
 top of 9 against 9 to 18 players with a 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:15.450
 minimum of 6 for 6 that would come to be 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:18.150
 maximum in a hard domain by teams or 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.070
 low confirmed normal the background is going to 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.690
 this time the gameplay in war domain 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.119
 terrestrial the truth that they move 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:25.920
 gameplay I will put a piece surely in 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.899
 the end what we have to comment this 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.360
 game mode because they are 9 minutes 

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:31.649
 and really what I can explain and I'm going 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.909
 to explain earth warfare is not very 

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:35.369
 long because I have to explain 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.899
 and respawn and game mode and others 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.330
 to little things that can come to you 

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:40.679
 well for this game mode first that 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:42.420
 nothing is more than clear that war 

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:46.020
 terrestrial serves us to remove the clips 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:48.840
 having a lot more people playing or 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.130
 is finding the opposing team with 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.590
 a lot more players because we have the 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.819
 possibility of taking good clips 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:56.520
 do enough multiple know four 

00:01:53.819 --> 00:01:59.159
 use and such I recommend it for 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.799
 various things first this from the clips 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:03.330
 well you do not know and you will know already but 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:05.190
 Well, this mode also suits us 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:08.759
 of game for various things for example 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:10.560
 to get a lot more out of the 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:14.370
 streak below it is clear that if there is no 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.959
 enemies that is 9 enemies because it is 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.239
 more likely that there are always some with 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:19.650
 sting gel if you play against 6 but if 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:21.520
 this does not happen, you are going to be able to do 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:24.820
 true havoc with the streak 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:28.090
 really in this team in which not 

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:29.980
 uses stinger or anything to knock down the 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:31.930
 helicopters and all the others are formed 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:34.510
 therefore I recommend it to take 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:36.430
 long streaks for example with a simple 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:38.410
 editor you can practically write down osuna 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:40.570
 double triple losses without any 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:42.580
 difficulty to speak 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:44.800
 therefore with this baixa as the a 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:46.960
 much longer streaks is a model that 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:50.710
 used to pull me out of 23 and makes 

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:52.150
 130 governor assault and others comes very 

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:53.890
 well because you can link 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:55.990
 perfectly a vice predictor with a 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:58.210
 I support hs directly and pulling out very 

00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:00.970
 fast and I'm random or whatever you want 

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:03.280
 or today playing a little with what's coming 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:04.690
 do the low runs and such is a 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.350
 game mode that also serves a lot 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:08.810
 to get out 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:11.540
 and all kinds of difficult challenges for 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:13.910
 example what comes to be five casualties 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:15.350
 with lawsuits so with a project can 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:17.150
 take out the five casualties then there is another one that 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:19.460
 is with the bombers even also 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:22.790
 you are going to be able to do this is pretty 

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:24.620
 It serves quite well for this too 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:27.020
 to exploit the boar you know that he 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:28.580
 javelin then in the deepest not for 

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:30.140
 normal equipment is difficult more expensive low 

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:32.060
 but it is played and low confirmed domain 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:35.180
 can be some way you are going to be able to 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:37.460
 scoring a lot lower than normal 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:39.080
 and independently of all this that 

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:40.660
 I just told you now we can 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:42.470
 find three different ways 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:45.070
 regardless of the new game that 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:45.070
 we play 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:49.780
 of how to play land war one that 

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:51.190
 I already told her to play to get closer 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:52.920
 clips usually do not 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:54.490
 snipers for mounts and so 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:57.640
 basically based on using 

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:59.320
 tactical realizations and trying 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:01.490
 always catch on responding enemies and 

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:03.350
 the rest 

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:04.490
 in all collectives we can do without a 

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:05.960
 little of what comes to be initiation 

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:08.450
 practice because it would be a bit 

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:11.000
 useless we would have to do the 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:12.650
 use of woof woof response and 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.870
 ballistic vest to be able to hold 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:17.390
 more the damage and being able to force more to do 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:19.550
 these clicks I would also recommend that if 

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:20.780
 you want them to be normal clips and a 

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:23.100
 sniper as the loaders 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:25.890
 expanded is a very good option 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:29.130
 second way to play land war 

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:31.800
 well as soon as we play with friends or 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:34.320
 just simply that we want to win and 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:37.310
 it's already the defensive turrets going to 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:40.710
 be of great help as I say in all 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:42.030
 comments the works that serve quite 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:49.130
 because it's going to be a rain of 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:49.130
 pomegranates cucumbers x25-m xm25 

00:04:49.249 --> 00:04:53.929
 and well I could also note that the 

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:56.079
 Using your rifle to move 

00:04:53.929 --> 00:04:58.389
 much faster in confirmed low and 

00:04:56.079 --> 00:05:00.349
 almost any game mode since 

00:04:58.389 --> 00:05:02.419
 you have to keep in mind that the maps 

00:05:00.349 --> 00:05:04.159
 they're the same and there's going to be a lot 

00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:06.769
 more people, because moving fast is going to 

00:05:04.159 --> 00:05:07.879
 give a big advantage so the 

00:05:06.769 --> 00:05:09.289
 use of your rifle and 

00:05:07.879 --> 00:05:11.539
 extreme conditioning as soon as 

00:05:09.289 --> 00:05:13.489
 low games confirmed will be great 

00:05:11.539 --> 00:05:18.469
 we are going to be able to catch a lot of many 

00:05:13.489 --> 00:05:20.749
 prime and good points and the other would come 

00:05:18.469 --> 00:05:22.549
 to be then to basically get what 

00:05:20.749 --> 00:05:24.340
 that comes to be good games like 

00:05:22.549 --> 00:05:26.080
 example to this one 

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:28.930
 what happens is that I make the exception 

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:30.220
 and I do not use your rifle but you do not 

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:31.750
 uses neither assault rifle nor 

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:34.000
 precision or light machine gun that is 

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:36.660
 what should be used on maps that do not 

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.850
 be small, of course 

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:40.860
 I recommend using hard line but I already 

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:43.710
 you know a mower in a good place os 

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:45.750
 can point many assists if the 

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:47.430
 you throw well and knowing our enemies 

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:49.290
 over all the domain that pretty easy 

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:53.070
 to know where the enemies are and 

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:55.230
 use streaks long streaks that do not 

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:58.410
 let's add the others with which I refer 

00:05:55.230 --> 00:06:00.150
 to these reapers ac-130 good came in a 

00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:02.520
 attack to me does not convince me but good 

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:04.320
 the gunner could also do it 

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:05.970
 two projects of these gusts which 

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:08.940
 we can take care of our life 

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:11.100
 we are well protected in one place and 

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:14.010
 so let's do this third 

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:17.080
 way how to get out then good 

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:19.659
 parties in terrestrial war 

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:23.020
 so more than I see two things 

00:06:19.659 --> 00:06:25.659
 fundamental but three the silencer 

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:28.479
 It seems fundamental to me because I fuck 

00:06:25.659 --> 00:06:29.949
 which are nine enemies take into account 

00:06:28.479 --> 00:06:32.740
 that as soon as you shoot and muffler 

00:06:29.949 --> 00:06:34.990
 get out on the map and nine enemies with 

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:37.310
 that two are attentive to the map and are going to 

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:41.650
 come to kill that is very likely 

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:44.330
 the second the extended chargers that 

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:46.370
 we are going to come very well those that the end 

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:48.710
 you know there are times when not 

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:50.540
 we can stop to recharge and we're going to 

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:52.100
 take great advantage besides that 

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:55.420
 we also expand the bullets that 

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:58.220
 we have in our soul and as a third 

00:06:55.420 --> 00:07:00.640
 as a third good I already told you that 

00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:02.930
 hard line prom seems fundamental to me 

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:04.190
 well I think that with this I have already done 

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:05.740
 everything I have to say for war 

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:07.479
 land 

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:09.639
 doing a bit of spam to my channel 

00:07:07.479 --> 00:07:11.229
 discount in Mr. i3 you can spend 

00:07:09.639 --> 00:07:13.040
 for the channel as you always have in the 

00:07:11.229 --> 00:07:16.160
 description 

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:17.750
 I know all the trips that get 

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:19.190
 many followers yesterday have been 100 more 

00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:21.530
 so therefore people who do not 

00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:23.840
 know the channel that is barely 

00:07:21.530 --> 00:07:25.100
 Knowing a little bit, you can spend 

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:26.870
 for the destruction you will see that it is a 

00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:29.710
 channel very similar to what it comes to be 

00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:33.320
 practical ways but focused another way 

00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:35.240
 good and nothing I think I've said everything 

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:36.980
 what I had to say I hope that you 

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:38.390
 have served do not forget about life 

00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:41.060
 favorites is very important for all 

00:07:38.390 --> 00:07:42.770
 we hope that I have served you and you 

00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:45.310
 I send a hug in his brother until 

00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:45.310
 then friends
