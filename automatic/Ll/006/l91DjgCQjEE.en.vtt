00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
what we needed to do we knew that we

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:49.910

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
can and

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.660 
can and
and<00:02:14.510> that<00:02:15.290> that<00:02:15.560> was<00:02:15.680> that<00:02:15.890> Sarah<00:02:16.400> had<00:02:16.459> an

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:18.429 
and that that was that Sarah had an
awesome<00:02:16.849> shot<00:02:17.329> and<00:02:17.629> I<00:02:17.840> think<00:02:18.019> it<00:02:18.110> really<00:02:18.140> just

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:21.079 
beginning of the second half and then

00:02:21.079 --> 00:02:23.110 
beginning of the second half and then
followed<00:02:21.890> really<00:02:22.250> shortly<00:02:22.549> after<00:02:22.790> Danny's

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
thought I'd actually put it a little bit

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:31.420

too<00:02:30.409> far<00:02:30.590> in<00:02:30.739> front<00:02:30.799> of<00:02:31.069> me<00:02:31.159> and<00:02:31.250> then<00:02:31.400> just

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
too far in front of me and then just

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.130 
too far in front of me and then just

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
thought well it's either going to miss a

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:35.020 
thought well it's either going to miss a
cage<00:02:33.409> or<00:02:33.709> it's<00:02:33.799> good<00:02:33.980> to<00:02:34.099> go<00:02:34.189> it<00:02:34.370> I<00:02:34.549> nailed<00:02:34.849> the

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030

00:03:10.869 --> 00:03:10.879 
little bit shaky of a start I mean we've

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:12.640 
little bit shaky of a start I mean we've
been<00:03:11.120> on<00:03:11.420> the<00:03:11.510> road<00:03:11.540> for<00:03:11.659> a<00:03:11.870> while<00:03:11.930> but<00:03:12.349> I<00:03:12.409> think

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.650 
been on the road for a while but I think

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:14.500 
been on the road for a while but I think
that<00:03:12.709> once<00:03:13.310> I<00:03:13.430> happened<00:03:13.760> we<00:03:13.909> realized<00:03:14.209> we<00:03:14.389> need

that once I happened we realized we need

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:16.990 
that once I happened we realized we need
to<00:03:14.689> calm<00:03:15.260> down<00:03:15.290> and<00:03:15.739> collect<00:03:16.519> ourselves<00:03:16.639> and

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.000 
to calm down and collect ourselves and

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.339 
to calm down and collect ourselves and
start<00:03:17.269> playing<00:03:17.480> the<00:03:17.569> way<00:03:17.659> you<00:03:17.720> could<00:03:17.930> play<00:03:18.139> and

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:54.889 
thought that Becky had a really good

00:03:54.889 --> 00:03:56.830 
thought that Becky had a really good
game<00:03:55.040> in<00:03:55.220> the<00:03:55.280> midfield<00:03:55.430> so<00:03:56.239> did<00:03:56.419> Hannah<00:03:56.629> who

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:56.840 
game in the midfield so did Hannah who

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:58.629 
game in the midfield so did Hannah who
made<00:03:57.019> some<00:03:57.260> brilliant<00:03:57.470> diving<00:03:57.859> tackles<00:03:58.459> and

made some brilliant diving tackles and

00:03:58.639 --> 00:04:00.399 
made some brilliant diving tackles and
then<00:03:59.060> topped<00:03:59.659> off<00:03:59.810> with<00:03:59.870> some<00:04:00.169> stellar

00:04:00.399 --> 00:04:00.409 
then topped off with some stellar

00:04:00.409 --> 00:04:02.770 
then topped off with some stellar
defense<00:04:00.859> we<00:04:01.430> just<00:04:01.669> had<00:04:01.940> all<00:04:02.180> of<00:04:02.209> our<00:04:02.359> focus<00:04:02.690> on

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:02.780

today to just trying to get through

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:05.500 
today to just trying to get through
today<00:04:04.190> we<00:04:04.459> knew<00:04:04.579> that<00:04:04.609> Ohio<00:04:05.030> was<00:04:05.239> a<00:04:05.269> really
