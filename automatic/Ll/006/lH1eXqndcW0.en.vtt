 I had already installed it before 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:34.810
 a little slow 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:04.220

 impossible you will be able to finish oh well 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:25.720
 after that we go out and go on the play 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:25.720

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:06.860
 with the previous version it had been 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:08.840
 created 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:13.909

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:17.389
 outfit and then in this version there 

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:20.289
 there will be levels up to 110 

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:23.709

00:05:54.649 --> 00:05:58.669
 starting a new game 

00:05:56.419 --> 00:06:01.129
 you will play with a tom we say of the 

00:05:58.669 --> 00:06:04.009
 the version of the outfit that 

00:06:01.129 --> 00:06:06.139
 let's say with the money they already give you 

00:06:04.009 --> 00:06:06.770
 yellow instead of loading a game 

00:06:06.139 --> 00:06:09.080
 previous one 

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:10.520

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:11.449
 hacked the one they downloaded 

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:13.279
 previously 

00:06:11.449 --> 00:06:15.610
 so we do load per game 

00:06:13.279 --> 00:06:15.610
 previous one 

00:06:15.949 --> 00:06:27.319
