 and then people connected here in the good channel and 

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:15.610
 cheap good supplements 

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:17.710
 I wanted to bring a video for you today. 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:20.770
 here not to talk about this product 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:23.619
 this product is a mere illustration 

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:25.750
 but to talk about multivitamins is 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:27.130
 its importance to those who seek the 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:28.780
 hypertrophy 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:30.910
 good first thing that would be a 

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:33.250
 multivitamin with a multivitamin 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:35.530
 you can call those two names that 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:39.520
 always basically the same thing 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:41.800
 vitamin complex that has an additional 10 or 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:44.470
 whether it can or multi more than one 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:46.720
 and with what would be the purpose of this 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:48.339
 multivitamin than vitamins and 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:51.489
 minerals for those who do not know are 

00:00:48.339 --> 00:00:53.739
 important nutrients in the body and 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:56.199
 among the things you can do when you 

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:59.199
 you have a deficit of vitamins and 

00:00:56.199 --> 00:01:01.030
 minerals is can cause is a drop in 

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:03.210
 your immune system ie you 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:06.549
 can get the flu makes you sick 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:08.470
 too easy can also cause weakness 

00:01:06.549 --> 00:01:11.170
 muscular that no one doing gym 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:13.510
 that this is clear and may cause other 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:15.760
 complications in the body tissues not only 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:21.250
 how muscle tissue is included in it 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:24.940
 and a multivitamin would work and 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:27.810
 province, it is the function of 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:30.130
 these vitamins you need 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:33.220
 vitaminize vitamin E is vitamin D 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:35.590
 vitamin C and magnesium calcium and do with 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:38.860
 that your body has a necessary one 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:40.810
 every day because for you to have all 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:43.090
 these vitamins in a day without taking 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:45.550
 no supplements I'll tell you 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:47.680
 that if you are not no vegetarian 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:50.530
 nor the people who are eating fruits 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:52.480
 I understand like a meat you will not 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:55.390
 get all these nutrients 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:57.850
 here for the right amount and for that 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.890
 would serve this multivitamin for 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:01.480
 example the most important vitamins 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:04.960
 and minerals that are most 

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:07.210
 question of muscular hypertrophy would be 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:09.459
 that would be found in the meat of 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:12.519
 ox beef liver beef 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:14.830
 basically the magnesium that the 

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:16.930
 magnesium also can be 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:19.389
 found a supplement called ze me 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:21.069
 magnesium synthesizer that would 

00:02:19.389 --> 00:02:22.030
 purpose of increasing the quality of 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:23.590
 your sleep 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:26.440
 and it can also be found in 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:28.510
 fruits like pineapple can be found 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.950
 bare and vegetables like lettuce 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:31.510
 I'll bring a video later 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.950
 cma for you 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:34.569
 When I bought it, of course not yet. 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:36.069
 I'm with him here another very much 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:38.590
 important to the chaos that would give 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:41.709
 bones to be found in the 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:43.150
 dairy products milk yogurt cheese 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:45.819
 milk and dairy products is more 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:48.550
 found in milk milk metabolism and 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:50.500
 bad find potassium that for all 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:52.810
 that you do not know is the people say that 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:55.360
 prevent the cameras do not know if it's true 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:57.760
 I came to research but I think in the 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:00.880
 truth and science no more his own 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:03.070
 I believe crediting your mother is found 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:05.650
 potassium found in banana in potatoes 

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:07.830
 sweet are great pretend drills are 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:10.450
 carbohydrates with the glycemic index 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:12.400
 very low are the most things 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:15.819
 advisable is you take before you 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:18.850
 strike the match that would be found in 

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:20.410
 milk and beef and vitamin C and 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:22.690
 Which for me I consider the most 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:26.440
 important in the matter of Petrofina 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:29.650
 vitamin c where you find out pineapple and 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:33.370
 is in orange to be found vitamin c 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:35.920
 and vitamin D which I also said to be 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:37.810
 found fish oil the omega-3 being 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:40.329
 found in the egg yolk there for you 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:42.220
 which is the goal with this is clear and stay 

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:44.440
 smart that egg yolk so much 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:45.850
 benefits it can bring 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:48.880
 benefits to the issue of your memory 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:51.489
 your brain bring increased vitamin 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:53.440
 d in your body is a very good thing to 

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:56.140
 Egg yolks of course have about three 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:58.750
 grams of fat there but if you ate 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:59.350
 an egg yolk djatÃ¡ is good 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:01.140
 size 

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:03.880
 I already told you about what a dog is. 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:05.739
 multivitamin to mineral vitamins 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:09.609
 but then I love to talk about this 

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:11.790
 multivitamin here before talking about it 

00:04:09.609 --> 00:04:14.190
 I'll want to say to you the 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:18.100
 multivitamin a supplement 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:20.200
 complementary 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:23.200
 it would be a supplement you have your 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:25.780
 protein albumin your mood and sounds 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:28.750
 and supplement that would be one that 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:31.030
 it is not essential he would come to help in the 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:33.790
 absorption of other supplements would 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:36.970
 to assist in your performance of a 

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:39.190
 an improvement in their disposition one day 

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:43.000
 supplement that does not give you 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:45.040
 muscle hypertrophy it will help your 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.870
 body to absorb the other nutrients 

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:49.960
 it will absorb the other nutrients 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:52.390
 better and thus will consequently make 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:54.610
 assumes petrofina muscular happen more 

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:57.310
 quickly but he did not come 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:59.320
 priority priority would be the protein 

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:02.260
 At home the supplement is clear without counting 

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:04.240
 the diet to tac diet on top 

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:06.070
 here below to supplements and that is 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:08.860
 down to the first feeding workout 

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:10.750
 You have to mean everything there. 

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:13.690
 mboto but supplemental under money 

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:15.100
 and I wanted to talk to this and that 

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:17.500
 multivitamin here and you still 

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:19.300
 I would like to have kept the victory there 

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:21.480
 Until now we do not speak he lends 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:24.550
 first as it cost you a price 

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:26.320
 two reais and ninety cents 

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:29.170
 I've seen a lot of people already 

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:33.010
 closing the video there would be a supplement 

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:35.680
 very cheap than 20 supplement pills 

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:37.780
 vitamin and mineral tablets ie 

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:40.630
 is not to analyze the 

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:44.980
 product is very good the capsule is this 

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:46.840
 here the little blue has a taste of glue 

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:49.180
 I'll tell you the taste and smell of 

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:51.880
 that this business you have is a 

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:54.790
 bad thing but of course this is 

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:57.220
 a tablet should be taken good with 

00:05:54.790 --> 00:06:01.270
 water but I did not feel any provision 

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:03.100
 The more you do not feel anything else, but you 

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:05.050
 have to understand that multivitamins do not 

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:06.790
 it would be a creative thing you're feeling 

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:09.370
 training your strength increasing 

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:11.770
 This is only going to help you here. 

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:13.840
 There is no way you can know if Sekita 

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:16.150
 not only if it was a 

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:18.370
 better provision some people have 

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:20.350
 this other not I did not have a uncle at all 

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:22.630
 with which there may be other ways 

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:24.580
 that the most intimate person effects the 

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:27.460
 feel something in your body plus the 

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:29.710
 can but only that the last single team he 

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:32.110
 delay to see that you have to 

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:34.180
 understand this multivitamin the 

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:36.640
 multivitamin if you go shopping 

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:38.410
 buy last case you for example 

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:41.140
 earn a buck more to your 

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:42.970
 work and did an extra work and then 

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:43.540
 You make a lot more money than you. 

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:45.300
 does 

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:47.819
 So how do you have 15? 

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:51.060
 goals in reais more in the pocket so 

00:06:47.819 --> 00:06:53.280
 you take purchase in the cma vitamin but 

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:59.639
 first priority is the other 

00:06:53.280 --> 00:07:00.990
 Supplements and Protein Supplements 

00:06:59.639 --> 00:07:03.060
 I hope you understood 

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:04.620
 basically what I meant is not a 

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:05.909
 too long video or too much video 

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:08.430
