the seventh oracle you guys can just run

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.760 
the seventh oracle you guys can just run
straight<00:04:11.280> to<00:04:11.460> the<00:04:11.910> middle<00:04:12.630> park<00:04:12.840> and<00:04:13.050> that

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:13.770 
straight to the middle park and that

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:15.140 
straight to the middle park and that
will<00:04:13.890> ensure<00:04:14.160> that<00:04:14.340> you<00:04:14.459> have<00:04:14.490> the<00:04:14.610> most<00:04:14.880> of

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:24.430 
so you do this about four to five times

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:26.280 
so you do this about four to five times
if<00:04:25.060> you<00:04:25.120> do<00:04:25.210> it<00:04:25.300> four<00:04:25.480> to<00:04:25.540> five<00:04:25.690> times<00:04:25.720> without

if you do it four to five times without
any<00:04:26.590> flaws<00:04:26.950> then<00:04:27.370> you<00:04:27.850> will<00:04:28.000> be<00:04:28.150> a<00:04:28.180> Theon<00:04:28.620> see

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:29.620

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:31.380 
any flaws then you will be a Theon see
everyone<00:04:30.010> left<00:04:30.220> at<00:04:30.400> the<00:04:30.640> three<00:04:30.940> second<00:04:31.240> mark

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:31.390

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:34.560 
everyone left at the three second mark
four<00:04:31.540> times<00:04:31.720> vengeance<00:04:32.170> I<00:04:33.000> mean<00:04:34.000> it's<00:04:34.150> simple

four times vengeance I mean it's simple
it<00:04:34.720> just<00:04:34.750> takes<00:04:35.140> a<00:04:35.230> little<00:04:35.380> bout<00:04:35.620> to<00:04:35.770> get<00:04:39.000> when

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:08.540 
then it's going to be very hard to
cleanse<00:05:04.180> well<00:05:04.390> do<00:05:04.480> them<00:05:04.570> at<00:05:04.720> the<00:05:04.750> same<00:05:04.840> time

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:08.550 

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:11.970 

see<00:05:09.550> I<00:05:09.580> I<00:05:09.790> was<00:05:10.180> able<00:05:10.330> to<00:05:10.450> cleanse<00:05:10.750> him<00:05:11.050> but<00:05:11.740> my

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:11.980 
see I I was able to cleanse him but my

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:13.800 
see I I was able to cleanse him but my
other<00:05:12.160> teammate<00:05:12.640> is<00:05:12.760> not<00:05:12.970> cleansed<00:05:13.390> so<00:05:13.540> I<00:05:13.570> had

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:13.810 
other teammate is not cleansed so I had

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:17.670 
other teammate is not cleansed so I had
to<00:05:13.840> wait<00:05:14.110> until<00:05:14.970> we<00:05:15.970> it's<00:05:16.840> a<00:05:16.960> you<00:05:17.110> ask<00:05:17.320> was<00:05:17.500> in

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:17.680 
to wait until we it's a you ask was in

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:19.050 
to wait until we it's a you ask was in
order<00:05:17.890> for<00:05:18.070> us<00:05:18.100> to<00:05:18.160> go<00:05:18.400> out<00:05:18.490> there<00:05:18.520> because<00:05:18.850> he

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:19.060 
order for us to go out there because he

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:21.150 
order for us to go out there because he
was<00:05:19.210> going<00:05:19.480> black<00:05:19.720> if<00:05:20.530> you<00:05:20.740> don't<00:05:20.890> cleanse

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:21.160 
was going black if you don't cleanse

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:23.040 
was going black if you don't cleanse
your<00:05:21.310> teammates<00:05:21.730> for<00:05:22.480> a<00:05:22.510> while<00:05:22.660> then<00:05:22.900> their

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:23.050 
your teammates for a while then their

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:25.350 
your teammates for a while then their
whole<00:05:23.200> screen<00:05:23.530> goes<00:05:23.740> black<00:05:24.100> if<00:05:24.940> their<00:05:25.210> whole

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:25.360 
whole screen goes black if their whole

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:28.740 
whole screen goes black if their whole
screen<00:05:25.630> goes<00:05:25.840> black<00:05:26.200> then<00:05:27.540> they're<00:05:28.540> most

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:28.750 
screen goes black then they're most

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:30.030 
screen goes black then they're most
likely<00:05:28.840> going<00:05:29.080> to<00:05:29.260> die<00:05:29.470> because<00:05:29.710> they're<00:05:29.890> not

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:30.040 
likely going to die because they're not

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:31.410 
likely going to die because they're not
going<00:05:30.160> to<00:05:30.220> know<00:05:30.400> where<00:05:30.910> the<00:05:31.030> hell<00:05:31.150> they<00:05:31.270> aren't

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:31.420 
going to know where the hell they aren't

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:33.690 
going to know where the hell they aren't
you<00:05:31.570> left<00:05:31.780> them<00:05:31.930> behind

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:33.700 
you left them behind

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:36.430
