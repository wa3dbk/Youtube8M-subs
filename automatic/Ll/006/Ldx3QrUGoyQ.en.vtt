00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.180
 Hello dear friends you already 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:09.349
 probably familiar here it is a tear 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:11.580
 bab 400r which we showed 

00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:14.639
 previous videos by the way here is a reference 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:17.029
 You can see what I want to talk about 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.690
 them when you work with such a mill 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:21.990
 heavy loads 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.519
 just such an allowance time and terms 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.760
 tighten as well as surface finish 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.590
 Interestingly often such records can 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.269
 fail 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:33.210
 they are painted well of course we can 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:35.550
 take a screwdriver turn the plate and another 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.860
 use the other side but how 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.710
 practice shows one side and 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:43.070
 the second side then the plate can be 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.969
 throw away actually 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:47.520
 only this front wears out 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:52.440
 the surface the prizes then and the tooth itself 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:54.600
 records if you take this body 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:59.989
 Again uruketo we do not like me here 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:01.530
 there is no new tricky solution 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:05.840
 this problem 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:10.350
 we have such a box in this box 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:21.560
 there is a mill or rather the body here 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:21.560
 the reverse side of these plates outlet 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:31.079
 forever so see what came up here 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.939
 such is not a tricky decision namely 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:35.280
 setting the plate in order 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:38.250
 use another part of it 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:41.310
 two more edges that is used 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:43.530
 plate so to speak for the beaver well we 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.840
 can take and extend her life yet 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.259
 having doubled it like this 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.640
 Now this part will work 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:53.460
 Now we will put it on the mandrel 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:56.230
 fix the spindle see how it all 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:59.740
 here it looks 

00:01:56.230 --> 00:02:02.020
 pin dure are we here plates that are already 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:07.000
 were consumed on the same surface 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:08.710
 Well now how many turns put 800 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.270
 rpm set filing 200 

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:14.130
 millimeters now let's see what of it 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:14.130
 we will be able to watch 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:39.480
 type all fire from 4 millimeter crowd here 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:42.810
 this line is obtained and we add 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:44.909
 turns see that chips in 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:47.250
 basically normal for coming here 

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:50.090
 the plates do not even see that they are in meat 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:50.090
 were 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:59.379
 this 

00:04:46.009 --> 00:04:48.759
 because 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:58.520
 Here is such a chip shatters 

00:04:55.139 --> 00:05:00.050
 oh mommy it will be 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:03.650
 fire alarm we have something 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:08.410
 set fire in principle to 4 millimeters per 

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:08.410
 the passage is taken boldly at the Schengen where we 

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:14.410
 people don't be afraid it's all like window dressing 

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:16.860
 Now we will bomb us 

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:16.860
 only 

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:26.819
 there is to spend well, that is five more 

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:29.210
 You can safely pile 55 millimeters for 

00:05:26.819 --> 00:05:29.210
 pass 

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:32.129
 dance 

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:38.389
 well let's summarize 

00:05:34.669 --> 00:05:43.740
 what does it give us here such a milling cutter 

00:05:38.389 --> 00:05:48.300
 slave 400r and your records will live 2 

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:50.669
 times longer principle work at high 

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:56.659
 frequency modes give such that 

00:05:50.669 --> 00:06:00.949
 so needed please contact 

00:05:56.659 --> 00:06:00.949
 get everyone bye
