his guy and Kiko Alonso who his rookie
season<00:03:28.260> was<00:03:28.890> really<00:03:29.340> really<00:03:29.489> good<00:03:29.550> like

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:29.880 
season was really really good like

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:31.790 
season was really really good like
people<00:03:30.150> could<00:03:30.330> pay<00:03:30.480> this<00:03:30.720> guy<00:03:30.780> to<00:03:30.959> looky<00:03:31.500> clean

people could pay this guy to looky clean

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:34.030 
people could pay this guy to looky clean
that's<00:03:32.010> just<00:03:32.190> because<00:03:32.310> he<00:03:33.239> was<00:03:33.420> another

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.040 
that's just because he was another

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:36.140 
that's just because he was another
Caucasian<00:03:35.040> line<00:03:35.220> back<00:03:35.519> I'm<00:03:35.670> joke<00:03:35.880> but<00:03:36.120> now

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
Caucasian line back I'm joke but now

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:37.970 
Caucasian line back I'm joke but now
like<00:03:36.570> he<00:03:36.690> was<00:03:36.810> really<00:03:37.110> good<00:03:37.260> rookie<00:03:37.410> season<00:03:37.830> so

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
like he was really good rookie season so

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:39.949 
like he was really good rookie season so
I<00:03:38.010> understanding<00:03:38.880> compared<00:03:39.360> to<00:03:39.540> the<00:03:39.660> DVD

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
I understanding compared to the DVD

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:41.660 
I understanding compared to the DVD
player<00:03:40.110> of<00:03:40.200> the<00:03:40.260> year<00:03:40.380> that<00:03:40.530> year<00:03:40.769> so<00:03:41.010> Kiko

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670 
player of the year that year so Kiko

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:44.060 
player of the year that year so Kiko
Alonso<00:03:41.700> is<00:03:42.390> a<00:03:42.450> good<00:03:42.900> fit<00:03:43.110> for<00:03:43.140> Chip<00:03:43.470> Kelly<00:03:43.709> skin

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:44.070 
Alonso is a good fit for Chip Kelly skin

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:45.440 
Alonso is a good fit for Chip Kelly skin
because<00:03:44.370> he<00:03:44.489> can<00:03:44.610> pretty<00:03:44.850> much<00:03:44.940> come<00:03:45.180> off<00:03:45.300> the

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
because he can pretty much come off the

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:47.540 
because he can pretty much come off the
edge<00:03:45.630> we<00:03:45.900> can<00:03:46.050> also<00:03:46.170> drop<00:03:46.739> back<00:03:46.980> into<00:03:47.220> coverage

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:47.550 
edge we can also drop back into coverage

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:48.979 
edge we can also drop back into coverage
and<00:03:47.910> that's<00:03:48.060> probably<00:03:48.300> why<00:03:48.570> they<00:03:48.690> got<00:03:48.840> rid<00:03:48.870> of

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:48.989 
and that's probably why they got rid of

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:50.720 
and that's probably why they got rid of
trick<00:03:49.230> called<00:03:49.470> the<00:03:49.590> truck<00:03:49.830> Cole<00:03:50.070> could<00:03:50.310> blitz

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:50.730 
trick called the truck Cole could blitz

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:53.240 
trick called the truck Cole could blitz
but<00:03:51.030> he<00:03:51.180> was<00:03:51.360> not<00:03:51.660> a<00:03:51.900> 34<00:03:52.410> outside<00:03:52.769> linebacker

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
but he was not a 34 outside linebacker

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:55.430 
but he was not a 34 outside linebacker
he<00:03:53.430> was<00:03:53.459> a<00:03:53.700> 4-3<00:03:54.150> defensive<00:03:54.900> end<00:03:55.080> convert

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.440 
he was a 4-3 defensive end convert

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:57.620 
he was a 4-3 defensive end convert
outside<00:03:55.920> linebacker<00:03:56.340> and<00:03:56.670> he<00:03:57.180> cannot<00:03:57.420> do<00:03:57.600> a

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:57.630 
outside linebacker and he cannot do a

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:59.060 
outside linebacker and he cannot do a
lot<00:03:57.810> of<00:03:57.840> things<00:03:57.959> back<00:03:58.290> into<00:03:58.530> coverage<00:03:58.800> so

00:03:59.060 --> 00:03:59.070 
lot of things back into coverage so

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:00.770 
lot of things back into coverage so
that's<00:03:59.220> probably<00:03:59.400> why<00:03:59.550> they<00:03:59.640> cut<00:03:59.820> him<00:04:00.060> and<00:04:00.269> now

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
that's probably why they cut him and now

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:02.330 
that's probably why they cut him and now
they<00:04:00.900> got<00:04:01.019> Kiko<00:04:01.350> Alonso<00:04:01.380> can<00:04:01.860> pretty<00:04:02.010> much<00:04:02.070> be

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 
they got Kiko Alonso can pretty much be

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:04.640 
they got Kiko Alonso can pretty much be
a<00:04:02.370> jack-of-all-trades<00:04:02.820> type<00:04:03.420> linebacker<00:04:04.080> do

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
a jack-of-all-trades type linebacker do

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:06.140 
a jack-of-all-trades type linebacker do
whatever<00:04:04.830> the<00:04:05.010> hell<00:04:05.160> you<00:04:05.190> want<00:04:05.550> him<00:04:05.670> to<00:04:05.790> do<00:04:05.910> it

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
whatever the hell you want him to do it

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:07.850 
whatever the hell you want him to do it
hopefully<00:04:06.330> come<00:04:06.690> with<00:04:06.810> an<00:04:06.900> ACL<00:04:07.260> injury<00:04:07.290> a

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:07.860 
hopefully come with an ACL injury a

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:09.680 
hopefully come with an ACL injury a
hundred<00:04:08.430> percent<00:04:08.519> because<00:04:08.850> he<00:04:09.060> does<00:04:09.239> not<00:04:09.269> then

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:09.690 
hundred percent because he does not then

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:11.390 
hundred percent because he does not then
there'll<00:04:09.840> be<00:04:09.870> a<00:04:09.959> bad<00:04:10.410> treatment<00:04:10.739> comes<00:04:11.100> off<00:04:11.280> of

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 
there'll be a bad treatment comes off of

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.520 
there'll be a bad treatment comes off of
it<00:04:11.489> but<00:04:11.640> like<00:04:11.880> he<00:04:12.000> did<00:04:12.120> last<00:04:12.150> year<00:04:12.570> or<00:04:12.840> playing
