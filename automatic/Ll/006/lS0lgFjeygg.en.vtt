Technology and today we're going to have
a<00:00:04.020> look<00:00:04.200> at<00:00:04.380> the<00:00:04.710> otterbox<00:00:05.430> defender<00:00:05.549> case<00:00:06.140> for

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.140 
a look at the otterbox defender case for

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.690 
a look at the otterbox defender case for
the<00:00:07.440> HTC<00:00:08.130> 8x<00:00:09.679> for<00:00:10.679> anyone<00:00:11.010> that<00:00:11.130> knows<00:00:11.309> me<00:00:11.370> I've

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
the HTC 8x for anyone that knows me I've

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.780 
the HTC 8x for anyone that knows me I've
had<00:00:12.630> some<00:00:12.900> problems<00:00:13.290> with<00:00:13.349> the<00:00:13.650> eax<00:00:14.280> recently

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
had some problems with the eax recently

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.269 
had some problems with the eax recently
I<00:00:15.030> found<00:00:15.330> that<00:00:15.990> only<00:00:16.199> around<00:00:16.590> the<00:00:16.770> bottom<00:00:17.160> of

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
I found that only around the bottom of

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.150 
I found that only around the bottom of
the<00:00:17.430> device<00:00:17.550> and<00:00:18.020> around<00:00:19.020> this<00:00:19.199> area<00:00:19.410> it

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
the device and around this area it

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.340 
the device and around this area it
scratches<00:00:20.670> quite<00:00:20.910> easily<00:00:21.180> despite<00:00:21.990> the<00:00:22.140> fact

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
scratches quite easily despite the fact

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.029 
scratches quite easily despite the fact
that<00:00:22.560> it's<00:00:22.890> not<00:00:23.250> going<00:00:23.640> to<00:00:23.880> do<00:00:24.000> any<00:00:24.180> sort<00:00:24.390> of<00:00:24.510> a

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:25.039 
that it's not going to do any sort of a

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:29.710 
that it's not going to do any sort of a
ruggedized<00:00:26.039> what<00:00:27.000> gore<00:00:27.390> you<00:00:28.109> know<00:00:28.490> strenuous

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:29.720 
ruggedized what gore you know strenuous

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.299 
ruggedized what gore you know strenuous
conditions<00:00:30.720> it<00:00:31.109> does<00:00:31.410> scratch<00:00:31.740> quite<00:00:32.070> easily

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
conditions it does scratch quite easily

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.680 
conditions it does scratch quite easily
so<00:00:32.690> the<00:00:33.690> only<00:00:34.110> combatant<00:00:34.590> that<00:00:35.180> it<00:00:36.180> was<00:00:36.420> the

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
so the only combatant that it was the

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.840 
so the only combatant that it was the
otterbox<00:00:37.290> defender<00:00:37.380> I<00:00:38.040> could<00:00:38.430> have<00:00:38.520> obviously

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
otterbox defender I could have obviously

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.630 
otterbox defender I could have obviously
went<00:00:39.090> with<00:00:39.300> three<00:00:39.480> of<00:00:39.600> these<00:00:39.690> other<00:00:39.899> cases<00:00:40.640> but

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
went with three of these other cases but

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.940 
went with three of these other cases but
none<00:00:41.969> offer<00:00:42.329> the<00:00:42.540> protection<00:00:43.079> that<00:00:43.350> the

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
none offer the protection that the

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.799 
none offer the protection that the
otterbox<00:00:44.489> does<00:00:44.700> so<00:00:45.210> straight<00:00:45.450> away<00:00:45.480> you've

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
otterbox does so straight away you've

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.549 
otterbox does so straight away you've
got<00:00:45.989> the<00:00:46.430> belt<00:00:47.430> clip<00:00:47.670> for<00:00:48.239> the<00:00:48.270> case<00:00:48.780> now

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
got the belt clip for the case now

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.049 
got the belt clip for the case now
literally<00:00:50.039> just<00:00:51.079> set<00:00:52.079> since<00:00:52.320> eight<00:00:52.530> here<00:00:53.059> and

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
literally just set since eight here and

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.020 
literally just set since eight here and
push<00:00:54.510> it<00:00:54.660> flat<00:00:54.960> and<00:00:55.320> the<00:00:55.860> clips<00:00:56.129> in<00:00:56.340> you<00:00:56.879> can

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
push it flat and the clips in you can

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.049 
push it flat and the clips in you can
see<00:00:57.210> it's<00:00:57.329> absolutely<00:00:58.230> solid<00:00:58.730> and<00:00:59.730> let's<00:00:59.910> just
