00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:09.089
 Keio University Yasuaki Kakehi Laboratory 

00:00:09.089 --> 00:00:10.450
 The research group is 

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:13.720
 SFC Open Research Forum 2010 at 

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:16.250
 We used deformation and alteration of materials 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:17.360
 Interface design 

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:20.100
 We introduced the exhibit 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.280
 Markers and sensors in this study 

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:24.879
 Without attaching any electronic device 

00:00:24.879 --> 00:00:27.350
 Detect the deformation of the paper and 

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:28.970
 I used to operate the video 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:32.119
 Suggests input / output interface 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:32.689
 With the projector 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:34.050
 One camera at a time 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.270
 Because I'm making 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:36.580
 The processing speed is so fast 

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:39.380
 Because real-time deformation can be taken as it is 

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:42.309
 Input is coming back as output soon 

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:45.649
 It is an interface of input and output 

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:47.809
 Touch display can be touched 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:49.589
 I think it is important 

00:00:49.589 --> 00:00:52.130
 Because this display uses deformation 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:54.500
 Because you can take deformation without touching it 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.039
 Even blowing or breathing or even giving vibration 

00:00:57.039 --> 00:00:59.750
 There is no need to touch because it senses deformation 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:01.680
 Contactless interaction 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.080
 Can be used 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.070
 This time it is called active stereo method 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:09.870
 Perform 3D image measurement using the method 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:12.930
 I'm getting a deformation of paper 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.200
 Focus on the characteristics of paper that it is easy to deform and stretch. 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.410
 As an intuitive video operation interface 

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:20.460
 Implementing 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:21.760
 There is no after touch display 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:24.460
 It is possible to put in something called tactile sense 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:28.330
 It's a slippery paper close to the skin 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:31.000
 If you want to produce a softer image 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.780
 It is a thin thing like Japanese paper. 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.060
 In addition to visual sense that it is soft 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:40.520
 Information presentation by touching 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.180
 It is possible 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.380
 By using this interface 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:46.490
 To tickets such as museums and cinemas 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:48.380
 I'm thinking about application 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.570
 Because it is the end if I use the ticket once 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:52.870
 More about the work 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:55.420
 This is what you want to know 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.570
 Hold the paper in front of the display 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.340
 Trying to change the height 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.440
 Even if it is a person whose hand is blocked after 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.850
 Because we can give a signal by breathing or vibration 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:10.950
 Such a display at such time 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.170
 I think that it can be used for guidance etc.
