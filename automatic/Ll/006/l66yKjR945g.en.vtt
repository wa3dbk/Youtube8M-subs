ship we've got check our camp card and

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:31.620 
ship we've got check our camp card and
see<00:00:29.290> what<00:00:29.500> they're<00:00:29.710> recommending<00:00:30.700> and<00:00:31.390> we'll

basically<00:00:33.550> need<00:00:33.700> to<00:00:33.730> change<00:00:34.090> it<00:00:34.329> we<00:00:35.170> can<00:00:35.410> do<00:00:35.560> we

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:35.680 
basically need to change it we can do we

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:37.800 
basically need to change it we can do we
can<00:00:35.710> move<00:00:35.950> this<00:00:36.130> gear<00:00:36.520> like<00:00:37.240> an<00:00:37.329> advance<00:00:37.720> or

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:37.810 
can move this gear like an advance or

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:39.930 
can move this gear like an advance or
retard<00:00:38.140> to<00:00:38.320> cam<00:00:38.530> timing<00:00:38.890> with<00:00:39.160> this<00:00:39.280> gear<00:00:39.579> and

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:39.940 
retard to cam timing with this gear and

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:41.340 
retard to cam timing with this gear and
then<00:00:40.060> we're<00:00:40.180> close<00:00:40.420> to<00:00:40.570> top<00:00:40.750> dead<00:00:40.960> center

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:41.350

add them together to 15 divided by two

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.940 
add them together to 15 divided by two
is<00:01:56.720> one<00:01:56.780> over<00:01:57.140> seven<00:01:57.410> and<00:01:57.590> a<00:01:57.710> half

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:57.950 
is one over seven and a half

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.460 
is one over seven and a half
okay<00:01:58.850> so<00:01:58.910> we're<00:01:59.270> wanting<00:01:59.899> to<00:01:59.960> have<00:02:00.110> to<00:02:00.259> agree

got it dialed in what's left to do for

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:08.859 
got it dialed in what's left to do for
the<00:02:07.550> camshaft<00:02:08.030> then<00:02:08.390> we're<00:02:08.509> going<00:02:08.630> to<00:02:08.690> put<00:02:08.840> a

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:08.869 
the camshaft then we're going to put a

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:10.419 
the camshaft then we're going to put a
locking<00:02:09.290> plate<00:02:09.530> back<00:02:09.830> underneath<00:02:10.280> these

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:10.429 
locking plate back underneath these

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:12.100 
locking plate back underneath these
bolts<00:02:10.880> I'll<00:02:11.000> lock<00:02:11.209> tight<00:02:11.480> two<00:02:11.630> bolts<00:02:11.959> and

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
bolts I'll lock tight two bolts and

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:13.300 
bolts I'll lock tight two bolts and
there's<00:02:12.290> some<00:02:12.410> little<00:02:12.590> tabs<00:02:12.860> that<00:02:13.070> you<00:02:13.190> can

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
there's some little tabs that you can

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.520 
there's some little tabs that you can
bend<00:02:13.700> up<00:02:13.910> and<00:02:14.420> dump<00:02:14.660> all<00:02:14.780> the<00:02:14.959> bolts<00:02:15.200> from<00:02:15.290> back

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:20.930 
what do we got to do to get ready for

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:22.360 
what do we got to do to get ready for
the<00:03:21.020> valve<00:03:21.200> train<00:03:21.440> okay<00:03:21.980> the<00:03:22.130> first<00:03:22.220> thing

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:22.370 
the valve train okay the first thing

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:23.590 
the valve train okay the first thing
we're<00:03:22.610> going<00:03:22.730> to<00:03:22.850> do<00:03:22.940> since<00:03:23.180> we<00:03:23.330> run<00:03:23.510> the

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:23.600 
we're going to do since we run the

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:25.930 
we're going to do since we run the
hydraulic<00:03:24.050> lifters<00:03:24.410> in<00:03:24.440> this<00:03:24.739> engine<00:03:25.070> I<00:03:25.310> like

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:25.940 
hydraulic lifters in this engine I like

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:28.330 
hydraulic lifters in this engine I like
to<00:03:26.060> take<00:03:26.270> them<00:03:26.450> and<00:03:26.570> this<00:03:27.470> is<00:03:27.590> just<00:03:27.950> prep<00:03:28.160> of

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:28.340 
to take them and this is just prep of

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:30.490 
to take them and this is just prep of
oil<00:03:28.520> and<00:03:29.330> we're<00:03:29.480> going<00:03:29.600> to<00:03:29.630> drop<00:03:29.870> our<00:03:30.080> lifters

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:30.500 
oil and we're going to drop our lifters

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:33.040 
oil and we're going to drop our lifters
in<00:03:30.530> there<00:03:30.890> I<00:03:31.190> like<00:03:31.370> to<00:03:31.430> have<00:03:31.640> them<00:03:31.760> set<00:03:32.030> up<00:03:32.060> so

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:33.050 
in there I like to have them set up so

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:35.949 
in there I like to have them set up so
they<00:03:33.230> take<00:03:34.010> oil<00:03:34.340> on<00:03:34.550> bleed<00:03:35.150> air<00:03:35.360> out<00:03:35.600> of<00:03:35.780> them

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:35.959 
they take oil on bleed air out of them

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:38.440 
they take oil on bleed air out of them
okay<00:03:36.440> so<00:03:36.500> just<00:03:36.739> it<00:03:37.250> just<00:03:37.459> kind<00:03:37.700> of<00:03:37.820> you<00:03:38.330> know

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:38.450 
okay so just it just kind of you know

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:42.699 
okay so just it just kind of you know
perhaps<00:03:38.660> the<00:03:38.930> lifters<00:03:39.290> to<00:03:39.489> stall<00:03:40.489> them<00:03:41.709> you

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:42.709 
perhaps the lifters to stall them you

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:44.500 
perhaps the lifters to stall them you
can<00:03:42.800> see<00:03:42.980> the<00:03:43.100> air<00:03:43.250> coming<00:03:43.280> out<00:03:43.760> of<00:03:43.790> them<00:03:44.060> see

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:44.510 
can see the air coming out of them see

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:46.810 
can see the air coming out of them see
the<00:03:44.630> bubbles<00:03:45.190> bleeding<00:03:46.190> they're<00:03:46.340> out<00:03:46.520> of<00:03:46.550> them

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:46.820 
the bubbles bleeding they're out of them

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:49.330 
the bubbles bleeding they're out of them
okay<00:03:47.590> now<00:03:48.590> that<00:03:48.709> we've<00:03:48.830> got<00:03:48.920> our<00:03:48.950> lifter

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:49.340 
okay now that we've got our lifter

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:51.190 
okay now that we've got our lifter
soaking<00:03:49.760> in<00:03:49.880> oil<00:03:50.060> next<00:03:50.780> thing<00:03:50.930> we're<00:03:51.049> going<00:03:51.140> to

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:51.200 
soaking in oil next thing we're going to

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:52.780 
soaking in oil next thing we're going to
check<00:03:51.470> is<00:03:51.739> our<00:03:51.890> piston<00:03:52.250> the<00:03:52.340> valve<00:03:52.519> clearance

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:52.790 
check is our piston the valve clearance

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:55.150 
check is our piston the valve clearance
can<00:03:53.360> I<00:03:53.600> got<00:03:53.989> a<00:03:54.019> solid<00:03:54.230> lifter<00:03:54.709> in<00:03:54.799> here<00:03:54.980> and<00:03:55.100> I'm

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:55.160 
can I got a solid lifter in here and I'm

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.970 
can I got a solid lifter in here and I'm
set<00:03:55.459> up<00:03:55.489> at<00:03:55.730> zero<00:03:55.970> lash<00:03:56.350> so<00:03:57.350> what<00:03:57.530> you<00:03:57.650> do<00:03:57.799> with

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:57.980 
set up at zero lash so what you do with

00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:58.539 
set up at zero lash so what you do with
this

00:03:58.539 --> 00:03:58.549 
this

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:01.060 
this
I<00:03:58.630> got<00:03:59.630> me<00:03:59.780> a<00:03:59.810> dial<00:04:00.019> indicator<00:04:00.410> on<00:04:00.590> top<00:04:00.799> of<00:04:00.950> my

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:01.070 
I got me a dial indicator on top of my

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:03.789 
I got me a dial indicator on top of my
retainer<00:04:01.430> right<00:04:02.120> okay<00:04:02.570> and<00:04:02.750> what<00:04:03.560> you<00:04:03.680> do

00:04:03.789 --> 00:04:03.799 
retainer right okay and what you do

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:06.250 
retainer right okay and what you do
we're<00:04:04.010> going<00:04:04.130> to<00:04:04.190> check<00:04:04.570> where<00:04:05.570> the<00:04:05.720> piston<00:04:05.930> is

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:06.260 
we're going to check where the piston is

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.140 
we're going to check where the piston is
closest<00:04:06.799> to<00:04:06.950> the<00:04:07.070> valve<00:04:07.370> and<00:04:07.760> it's<00:04:07.940> going<00:04:08.090> to

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:08.150 
closest to the valve and it's going to

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:11.020 
closest to the valve and it's going to
be<00:04:08.540> on<00:04:08.780> the<00:04:09.230> overlap<00:04:09.709> phase<00:04:10.100> of<00:04:10.340> the<00:04:10.430> camshaft

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:11.030 
be on the overlap phase of the camshaft

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:12.970 
be on the overlap phase of the camshaft
it'll<00:04:11.360> be<00:04:11.420> on<00:04:11.510> the<00:04:11.660> stroke<00:04:12.320> right<00:04:12.620> at<00:04:12.830> your

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:12.980 
it'll be on the stroke right at your

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:15.310 
it'll be on the stroke right at your
correct<00:04:13.519> but<00:04:14.150> the<00:04:14.269> piston<00:04:14.630> is<00:04:14.720> coming<00:04:15.019> up<00:04:15.170> and

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:15.320 
correct but the piston is coming up and

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:16.930 
correct but the piston is coming up and
it's<00:04:15.470> chasing<00:04:15.739> that<00:04:15.980> exhaust<00:04:16.370> valve<00:04:16.640> up<00:04:16.820> the

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:16.940 
it's chasing that exhaust valve up the

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:18.909 
it's chasing that exhaust valve up the
hole<00:04:17.120> okay<00:04:17.479> so<00:04:18.049> we're<00:04:18.200> going<00:04:18.320> to<00:04:18.380> go<00:04:18.530> to<00:04:18.590> ten

00:04:18.909 --> 00:04:18.919 
hole okay so we're going to go to ten

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:21.340 
hole okay so we're going to go to ten
thousandths<00:04:19.609> before<00:04:20.000> overlap<00:04:20.510> okay<00:04:21.140> and

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:21.350 
thousandths before overlap okay and

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:23.170 
thousandths before overlap okay and
that's<00:04:21.769> what<00:04:21.950> the<00:04:22.220> tightest<00:04:22.790> spot<00:04:22.970> that's

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:23.180 
that's what the tightest spot that's

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:25.930 
that's what the tightest spot that's
going<00:04:23.330> to<00:04:23.390> be<00:04:23.660> in<00:04:23.870> a<00:04:24.410> running<00:04:24.680> engine<00:04:25.010> and<00:04:25.220> one

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:25.940 
going to be in a running engine and one

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:27.040 
going to be in a running engine and one
thing<00:04:26.090> that's<00:04:26.210> really<00:04:26.300> neat<00:04:26.600> about<00:04:26.630> it<00:04:26.870> you
