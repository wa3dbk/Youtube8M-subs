he had
made<00:02:06.609> a<00:02:06.640> great<00:02:06.909> recovery<00:02:07.060> and<00:02:08.310> was<00:02:09.310> really

00:02:09.809 --> 00:02:09.819 
made a great recovery and was really

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:12.270 
made a great recovery and was really
strong<00:02:10.330> where<00:02:11.170> he<00:02:11.260> was<00:02:11.410> really<00:02:11.650> dealing<00:02:12.040> with

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
strong where he was really dealing with

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:13.920 
strong where he was really dealing with
that<00:02:12.459> all<00:02:12.640> through<00:02:12.910> training<00:02:13.330> camp<00:02:13.360> a<00:02:13.720> year

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
that all through training camp a year

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:17.190 
that all through training camp a year
ago<00:02:14.230> and<00:02:14.530> he<00:02:15.519> felt<00:02:15.970> like<00:02:16.150> a<00:02:16.180> new<00:02:16.480> man<00:02:16.660> out<00:02:16.959> there

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
ago and he felt like a new man out there

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.400 
ago and he felt like a new man out there
and<00:02:17.440> so<00:02:18.280> I<00:02:18.670> think<00:02:18.819> coming<00:02:19.209> back<00:02:19.390> he'll<00:02:20.260> be

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
and so I think coming back he'll be

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.320 
and so I think coming back he'll be
he'll<00:02:20.680> be<00:02:20.800> tough<00:02:21.069> to<00:02:21.340> to<00:02:21.670> unsee<00:02:22.000> but<00:02:22.180> he'll

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330 
he'll be tough to to unsee but he'll

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:24.839 
he'll be tough to to unsee but he'll
definitely<00:02:22.510> be<00:02:22.780> challenged<00:02:23.470> yeah<00:02:24.310> because<00:02:24.519> in

00:02:24.839 --> 00:02:24.849 
definitely be challenged yeah because in

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:27.449 
definitely be challenged yeah because in
a<00:02:24.910> lot<00:02:25.060> of<00:02:25.090> places<00:02:25.569> you<00:02:26.230> know<00:02:26.349> college<00:02:27.190> would

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:27.459 
a lot of places you know college would

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:28.710 
a lot of places you know college would
you<00:02:27.549> say<00:02:27.730> this<00:02:27.910> group<00:02:28.090> that<00:02:28.299> you<00:02:28.390> have<00:02:28.540> right

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
you say this group that you have right

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.259 
you say this group that you have right
now<00:02:28.750> is<00:02:28.930> maybe<00:02:29.860> the<00:02:30.010> most<00:02:30.190> talented<00:02:30.670> you've

00:02:31.259 --> 00:02:31.269 
now is maybe the most talented you've

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:33.509 
now is maybe the most talented you've
been<00:02:31.420> around<00:02:31.599> we've<00:02:32.530> got<00:02:32.560> a<00:02:32.769> we've<00:02:33.099> got<00:02:33.129> a<00:02:33.280> good

00:02:33.509 --> 00:02:33.519 
been around we've got a we've got a good

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:35.070 
been around we've got a we've got a good
we've<00:02:33.849> got<00:02:33.970> a<00:02:34.000> good<00:02:34.209> group

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
we've got a good group

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:38.720 
we've got a good group
not<00:02:36.069> sure<00:02:36.280> I'd<00:02:36.370> say<00:02:36.640> that<00:02:36.879> but<00:02:37.150> it's<00:02:37.299> close

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
not sure I'd say that but it's close

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:42.420 
not sure I'd say that but it's close
considering<00:02:40.560> the<00:02:41.560> two<00:02:41.739> Martin's<00:02:42.099> are<00:02:42.220> gone

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.060 
development yeah I mean we're that's not

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:56.640 
development yeah I mean we're that's not
we're<00:02:55.360> anywhere<00:02:55.660> near<00:02:56.019> where<00:02:56.140> it<00:02:56.200> needs<00:02:56.470> to<00:02:56.560> be

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
we're anywhere near where it needs to be

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:58.619 
we're anywhere near where it needs to be
it's<00:02:57.069> definitely<00:02:57.459> out<00:02:57.790> of<00:02:57.910> whack<00:02:58.120> we've<00:02:58.420> been

00:02:58.619 --> 00:02:58.629 
it's definitely out of whack we've been

progress there but in the long run what

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:19.050 
progress there but in the long run what
we've<00:03:17.680> gone<00:03:17.920> through<00:03:17.980> this<00:03:18.430> spring<00:03:18.819> will

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
we've gone through this spring will

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:21.420 
we've gone through this spring will
really<00:03:19.329> benefit<00:03:19.840> the<00:03:19.989> football<00:03:20.380> team<00:03:20.620> because

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.430 
really benefit the football team because

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:24.440 
really benefit the football team because
we've<00:03:22.150> had<00:03:22.389> guys<00:03:22.630> pretty<00:03:23.230> much<00:03:23.440> everywhere

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
we've had guys pretty much everywhere

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:28.020 
we've had guys pretty much everywhere
after<00:03:25.620> Matt<00:03:26.620> Haggerty<00:03:27.069> at<00:03:27.160> centre<00:03:27.579> and<00:03:27.819> Mark

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.030 
after Matt Haggerty at centre and Mark

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:30.180 
after Matt Haggerty at centre and Mark
Carol<00:03:28.389> at<00:03:28.480> center<00:03:28.870> everybody<00:03:29.709> else<00:03:29.889> has

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:30.190 
Carol at center everybody else has

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:32.660 
Carol at center everybody else has
played<00:03:30.489> everywhere<00:03:31.060> else<00:03:31.299> so<00:03:31.959> I<00:03:32.260> think

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:32.670 
played everywhere else so I think

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:35.940 
played everywhere else so I think
sometimes<00:03:33.670> they<00:03:34.420> well<00:03:34.930> they<00:03:35.349> did<00:03:35.620> struggle

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:35.950 
sometimes they well they did struggle

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:38.699 
sometimes they well they did struggle
and<00:03:36.310> have<00:03:36.459> struggled<00:03:37.060> with<00:03:37.599> it<00:03:37.810> but<00:03:38.410> it<00:03:38.530> also

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:38.709 
and have struggled with it but it also

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:40.259 
and have struggled with it but it also
helps<00:03:39.250> you<00:03:39.370> be<00:03:39.519> a<00:03:39.549> better<00:03:39.609> football<00:03:40.000> player

00:03:40.259 --> 00:03:40.269 
helps you be a better football player

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:42.150 
helps you be a better football player
because<00:03:41.139> it<00:03:41.290> gives<00:03:41.440> you<00:03:41.590> a<00:03:41.650> much<00:03:41.950> better

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:42.160 
because it gives you a much better

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:45.030 
because it gives you a much better
understanding<00:03:42.280> of<00:03:43.030> the<00:03:43.180> whole<00:03:43.810> picture<00:03:44.109> so

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.040 
understanding of the whole picture so

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:48.569 
understanding of the whole picture so
yes<00:03:45.609> we're<00:03:46.480> concerned<00:03:46.959> about<00:03:47.109> that<00:03:47.620> the

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:48.579 
yes we're concerned about that the

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:51.120 
yes we're concerned about that the
ability<00:03:49.299> to<00:03:49.419> function<00:03:49.660> as<00:03:49.959> a<00:03:49.989> unit<00:03:50.139> but<00:03:51.069> I

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:51.130 
ability to function as a unit but I

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:53.159 
ability to function as a unit but I
think<00:03:51.639> we'll<00:03:51.790> have<00:03:51.880> time<00:03:52.209> to<00:03:52.389> get<00:03:52.510> that<00:03:52.720> solved

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:53.169 
think we'll have time to get that solved

00:03:53.169 --> 00:03:55.650 
think we'll have time to get that solved
in<00:03:53.260> August
