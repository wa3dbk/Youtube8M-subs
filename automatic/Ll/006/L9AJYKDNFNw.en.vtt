then we'll open the search box as

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:40.639 
then we'll open the search box as
closest<00:00:38.300> I'll<00:00:39.300> make<00:00:39.510> that<00:00:39.540> one<00:00:39.930> one<00:00:40.110> two<00:00:40.320> three

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
closest I'll make that one one two three

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.360 
closest I'll make that one one two three
the<00:00:40.950> one<00:00:41.129> on<00:00:41.160> the<00:00:41.250> right<00:00:41.309> four<00:00:41.700> five<00:00:41.910> six<00:00:43.370> right

the one on the right four five six right

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:06.440 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:08.510 

alright<00:01:07.440> we're<00:01:07.590> looking<00:01:07.860> for<00:01:08.010> the<00:01:08.040> closest

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
alright we're looking for the closest

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:14.859 
alright we're looking for the closest
one<00:01:08.700> to<00:01:08.880> 15<00:01:09.530> maybe<00:01:10.530> we<00:01:10.770> have<00:01:10.950> a<00:01:10.979> 15<00:01:12.080> who<00:01:13.080> knows

00:01:14.859 --> 00:01:14.869 
one to 15 maybe we have a 15 who knows

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:24.580 
one to 15 maybe we have a 15 who knows
we<00:01:15.869> have<00:01:18.140> 5622<00:01:19.140> that's<00:01:19.680> seven<00:01:20.100> off<00:01:20.250> 50<00:01:20.880> 30<00:01:21.590> tues

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:24.590 
we have 5622 that's seven off 50 30 tues

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:34.310 
we have 5622 that's seven off 50 30 tues
1373<00:01:25.590> it<00:01:26.039> was<00:01:26.220> own<00:01:27.500> 5073<00:01:29.899> 9454<00:01:31.399> 72<00:01:32.399> and<00:01:32.700> 76<00:01:33.289> so<00:01:34.289> I

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
1373 it was own 5073 9454 72 and 76 so I

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.820 
1373 it was own 5073 9454 72 and 76 so I
guess<00:01:34.410> the<00:01:34.710> closest<00:01:35.130> to<00:01:35.250> 15<00:01:35.759> was<00:01:36.090> 22<00:01:36.780> which<00:01:37.680> is

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:37.830 
guess the closest to 15 was 22 which is

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:59.199 
guess the closest to 15 was 22 which is
seven<00:01:38.220> off<00:01:49.009> all<00:01:50.009> right<00:01:50.610> hand<00:01:50.910> box<00:01:51.539> number<00:01:52.080> for
