00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
strokes a bit of a strong word some of a

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.700 
strokes a bit of a strong word some of a
gentle<00:00:44.969> pull<00:00:45.300> so<00:00:46.079> what<00:00:46.230> you're<00:00:46.350> doing<00:00:46.620> is

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
gentle pull so what you're doing is

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.260 
gentle pull so what you're doing is
you're<00:00:46.829> just<00:00:46.980> pulling<00:00:47.399> into<00:00:47.550> the<00:00:47.760> fish<00:00:48.000> and

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
you're just pulling into the fish and

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.090 
you're just pulling into the fish and
the<00:00:48.600> best<00:00:48.809> way<00:00:48.960> to<00:00:48.989> do<00:00:49.260> it<00:00:49.379> is<00:00:49.469> to<00:00:49.620> do<00:00:49.739> a<00:00:49.770> low

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
the best way to do it is to do a low

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.819 
the best way to do it is to do a low
sweep<00:00:50.610> of<00:00:50.850> the<00:00:50.969> rod<00:00:51.180> so<00:00:51.390> in<00:00:52.199> this<00:00:52.320> case<00:00:52.590> I'd

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
sweep of the rod so in this case I'd

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.260 
sweep of the rod so in this case I'd
sweep<00:00:53.100> it<00:00:53.280> round<00:00:53.489> to<00:00:53.670> the<00:00:53.789> left

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
sweep it round to the left

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.630 
sweep it round to the left
nice<00:00:54.629> and<00:00:54.899> low<00:00:55.050> to<00:00:55.110> the<00:00:55.260> water<00:00:55.399> so<00:00:56.399> you're<00:00:56.520> not

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
nice and low to the water so you're not

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.849 
nice and low to the water so you're not
pulling<00:00:57.480> the<00:00:57.690> float<00:00:57.930> too<00:00:58.170> hard<00:00:58.440> and<00:00:58.710> you're

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
pulling the float too hard and you're

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.619 
pulling the float too hard and you're
not<00:00:59.010> risking<00:00:59.430> dragging<00:01:00.030> the<00:01:00.149> float<00:01:00.390> and

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
not risking dragging the float and

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.090 
not risking dragging the float and
flying<00:01:00.989> out<00:01:01.199> the<00:01:01.320> water<00:01:01.500> if<00:01:01.710> you<00:01:01.800> miss<00:01:01.949> the

strike<00:03:27.030> because<00:03:27.390> you<00:03:27.540> got<00:03:27.659> a<00:03:27.690> lot<00:03:27.930> of<00:03:27.959> line<00:03:28.230> to

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
strike because you got a lot of line to

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.020 
strike because you got a lot of line to
pick<00:03:28.680> up<00:03:28.860> before<00:03:29.069> you<00:03:29.310> connect<00:03:29.640> with<00:03:29.700> the<00:03:29.849> fish

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
pick up before you connect with the fish

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:32.119 
pick up before you connect with the fish
in<00:03:30.239> this<00:03:30.540> case<00:03:30.750> there's<00:03:30.989> a<00:03:31.049> bite<00:03:31.230> and<00:03:31.500> a<00:03:31.830> strike

00:03:32.119 --> 00:03:32.129 
in this case there's a bite and a strike

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:35.080 
in this case there's a bite and a strike
and<00:03:32.400> you've<00:03:32.489> got<00:03:32.640> it<00:03:32.790> so<00:03:33.239> it's<00:03:33.390> a<00:03:33.450> nice<00:03:33.599> smooth

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:35.090 
and you've got it so it's a nice smooth

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:42.470 
and you've got it so it's a nice smooth
we<00:03:36.090> got<00:03:36.269> it<00:03:36.420> now<00:03:38.510> I've<00:03:39.510> liked<00:03:39.810> the<00:03:39.989> hot<00:03:41.480> here

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
we got it now I've liked the hot here

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:56.120 
we got it now I've liked the hot here
one<00:03:43.140> more<00:03:43.290> go<00:03:43.470> noth-nothing<00:03:43.860> a<00:03:44.069> sharpener

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:56.130 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:58.220 

the<00:03:56.730> cast<00:03:57.180> again<00:03:57.420> look<00:03:57.720> let<00:03:57.870> now<00:03:58.020> leave<00:03:58.200> it

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.230 
the cast again look let now leave it

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:00.470 
the cast again look let now leave it
there<00:03:58.440> leave<00:03:58.620> it<00:03:58.710> there<00:03:58.890> just<00:03:59.760> tighten<00:04:00.180> up<00:04:00.270> to

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
there leave it there just tighten up to

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.830 
there leave it there just tighten up to
it<00:04:00.630> so<00:04:01.380> there<00:04:01.620> you<00:04:01.680> go<00:04:01.800> stop<00:04:02.100> and<00:04:02.360> then<00:04:03.360> what's

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 
it so there you go stop and then what's

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:10.940 
it so there you go stop and then what's
your<00:04:03.930> float<00:04:09.290> so<00:04:10.290> what's<00:04:10.500> happening<00:04:10.770> is<00:04:10.920> the

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:10.950 
your float so what's happening is the

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:13.760 
your float so what's happening is the
maggots<00:04:11.460> your<00:04:12.060> hook<00:04:12.210> baits<00:04:12.450> falling<00:04:13.350> nice<00:04:13.530> and

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:13.770 
maggots your hook baits falling nice and

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:16.160 
maggots your hook baits falling nice and
slowly<00:04:14.010> with<00:04:14.340> the<00:04:14.490> other<00:04:14.840> feed<00:04:15.840> that<00:04:15.990> we've

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:16.170 
slowly with the other feed that we've

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:19.160 
slowly with the other feed that we've
fed<00:04:16.580> just<00:04:17.580> those<00:04:17.760> small<00:04:18.450> shot<00:04:18.930> is<00:04:19.140> just

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:19.170 
fed just those small shot is just

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:21.560 
fed just those small shot is just
settling<00:04:19.739> everything<00:04:20.130> down<00:04:20.310> nicely<00:04:20.580> you<00:04:21.390> can

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:21.570 
settling everything down nicely you can

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:25.850 
settling everything down nicely you can
see<00:04:21.750> the<00:04:21.930> float<00:04:22.170> now<00:04:23.480> and<00:04:24.590> hopefully<00:04:25.590> we'll

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860 
see the float now and hopefully we'll

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:34.540 
see the float now and hopefully we'll
get<00:04:25.950> a<00:04:26.010> bite

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:34.550 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:37.270 

when<00:04:35.120> I<00:04:35.210> strike<00:04:35.720> to<00:04:35.930> the<00:04:36.080> left<00:04:36.319> do<00:04:36.650> I<00:04:36.680> reel<00:04:37.069> in

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:37.280 
when I strike to the left do I reel in

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:40.059 
when I strike to the left do I reel in
while<00:04:37.520> I<00:04:37.550> strike<00:04:38.030> no<00:04:38.300> not<00:04:38.840> strike<00:04:39.139> first<00:04:39.470> yeah

00:04:40.059 --> 00:04:40.069 
while I strike no not strike first yeah

00:04:40.069 --> 00:04:41.860 
while I strike no not strike first yeah
until<00:04:40.310> you<00:04:40.490> feel<00:04:40.759> the<00:04:40.910> fish<00:04:41.150> and<00:04:41.419> then

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:41.870 
until you feel the fish and then

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:45.129 
until you feel the fish and then
gradually<00:04:42.530> reel<00:04:42.919> in<00:04:43.360> to<00:04:44.360> make<00:04:44.569> contact<00:04:45.050> with

00:04:45.129 --> 00:04:45.139 
gradually reel in to make contact with

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:46.719 
gradually reel in to make contact with
the<00:04:45.289> fish<00:04:45.470> and<00:04:45.650> determine<00:04:46.250> how<00:04:46.370> big<00:04:46.550> it<00:04:46.699> is

00:04:46.719 --> 00:04:46.729 
the fish and determine how big it is

00:04:46.729 --> 00:04:50.369 
the fish and determine how big it is
there<00:04:47.060> you<00:04:47.090> go<00:04:47.240> strike<00:04:47.949> have<00:04:48.949> we<00:04:49.039> got<00:04:49.220> it

00:04:50.369 --> 00:04:50.379 
there you go strike have we got it

00:04:50.379 --> 00:04:53.710 
there you go strike have we got it
yeah<00:04:51.379> so<00:04:51.949> keep<00:04:52.340> the<00:04:52.460> rod<00:04:52.639> gentle<00:04:53.180> and<00:04:53.360> then

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:53.720 
yeah so keep the rod gentle and then

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:55.180 
yeah so keep the rod gentle and then
when<00:04:53.870> you<00:04:53.930> get<00:04:54.080> quite<00:04:54.379> close<00:04:54.560> in<00:04:54.680> like<00:04:55.009> that

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:55.190 
when you get quite close in like that

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:57.219 
when you get quite close in like that
stop<00:04:55.490> leaning<00:04:55.669> now<00:04:55.970> on<00:04:56.150> this<00:04:56.330> and<00:04:56.629> start<00:04:56.960> to

00:04:57.219 --> 00:04:57.229 
stop leaning now on this and start to

00:04:57.229 --> 00:05:02.499 
stop leaning now on this and start to
lift<00:04:57.409> up<00:04:57.650> okay<00:04:58.610> and<00:04:59.139> swing<00:05:00.139> the<00:05:00.229> fish<00:05:00.440> in<00:05:01.509> okay

00:05:02.499 --> 00:05:02.509 
lift up okay and swing the fish in okay

00:05:02.509 --> 00:05:07.809 
lift up okay and swing the fish in okay
it's<00:05:02.990> not<00:05:03.169> massive<00:05:04.479> that's<00:05:05.479> it<00:05:06.610> but<00:05:07.610> it's<00:05:07.759> a

00:05:07.809 --> 00:05:07.819 
it's not massive that's it but it's a

00:05:07.819 --> 00:05:09.360 
it's not massive that's it but it's a
