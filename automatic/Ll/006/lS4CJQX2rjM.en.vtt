00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:06.299
 hello i have you in facebook and 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:08.730
 instagram a photo small in which I 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:13.049
 this product has shown you that 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:14.639
 the st moritz volz - and yes I use 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.690
 It has been longer and that's why I can 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:22.949
 give you a little review and 

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:25.019
 Although it costs six euros so mostly 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.820
 very good so currently costs around the 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:31.710
 six euros still what I do not quite know 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:33.870
 did exactly as I had with the head has 15 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:37.200
 euro costs the right there I have it 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:39.809
 also in amazon link by right in the 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.820
 from the box it is very different than that 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:46.230
 Other creams you always get 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:49.469
 used there are sunscreen then there 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.750
 It's these guys tan tanning spray 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:54.539
 but there I always find that one way 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:57.600
 Patch gets so over and over 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:59.340
 the technical recommend so I'm there 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.350
 not found any really good 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.300
 is you could imagine why is 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.369
 that's me, I have it once 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.400
 tried and then I have to work 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:11.460
 and then here I got pretty much myself 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:14.369
 cream again and there it is 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.290
 good that I have regular videos now 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.369
 wanted to upload and then you look up 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.900
 the lesson i if i wanted me 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:22.590
 start again regularly 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:25.409
 use and saw you have so synonymous 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.600
 That should depend on your strength 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:30.600
 twice a week or three times the 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:34.950
 but use six hours a week 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:36.600
 at least affect the body 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.990
 let it be done, for example, in the evening 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:42.210
 always just before I go to sleep so 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.200
 through that throughout and everywhere on the 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:47.189
 distribute body 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:51.659
 it's not that brutal right now but it 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:54.689
 is not that good either, so off in 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:58.259
 direction you think so ok but report on 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:02:00.000
 whole body so and yes that has that 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:02.189
 Disadvantage of it is not so now 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.560
 you do not even look or say that 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:06.450
 she who is so sensitive 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:12.270
 images not recommended I wanted to I 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:14.430
 but now that's how it works 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:17.819
 it is therefore that it looks like that 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:19.620
 but I can manage that will come 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:21.780
 sometimes this liquid on it though 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:27.150
 not that it has to be there anyway 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:30.080
 shake her vigorously, which she does 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:32.790
 Need is such a glove or this 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:36.420
 disaster of I told you at that time in 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:37.739
 quito mentoring glove and it is 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.680
 also a bit brown because I have the 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:42.569
 color have not gotten really 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:44.790
 but just knows something like that for five 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:47.129
 euro I believe or four euros you can 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:50.580
 that you have to buy your food if you 

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:52.709
 herrchen not have are we here 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:54.690
 and if you 're after a judge like that 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:56.220
 dodge and not he but flats 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:58.500
 and different because you have to have your hands 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:00.360
 Also lotion and her the expensive of 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.940
 first wash for six hours 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:05.489
 I have that before with cotton pads 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:08.580
 made there so evelyn so in 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:11.790
 dm there are so small but synonymous 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:13.860
 bigger ones are this face and the 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:16.110
 but please recommend books 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:18.629
 do not forget in any case before you 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:24.420
 That's what gloves do 

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:26.010
 because the cotton pads is thought of as 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:27.629
 I initially therefore always landline 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:32.340
 made because I have this simple 

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:34.560
 but it was the ipad through the web 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:36.390
 not so tight and the liquid comes 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:38.909
 By this you mean all yours 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:41.640
 room full of brown color 

00:03:38.909 --> 00:03:43.459
 You can not do that easily 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:46.440
 is that really good shake 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:58.200
 would you be wondering which is now a 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:04:02.610
 a bit strange and then you have to 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:06.720
 you the here a worker typical 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:11.360
 I typically have to do that 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:11.360
 do it pretty fast 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:16.400
 do not get stripes 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:40.639
 which is also good as dyed directly 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:42.729
 So you know where you are already 

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:46.639
 have creamed and where not 

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:50.000
 and yes, as you can see, even though I am so 

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:51.380
 was pushing sounds like I have now 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.820
 no not riding here 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:55.190
 and that's really good 

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:57.520
 So I distribute eg for the 

00:04:55.190 --> 00:05:00.740
 difference 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:03.500
 I do not know if I know that 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:05.740
 but now I realize that so that 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:10.639
 I let that impress a bit 

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:13.550
 because it is also fast moving in and out 

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:15.770
 then finally the whole thing again 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:20.360
 with each use you have to each 

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:24.680
 case the bottle shake and then there 

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:29.360
 he again points off and I would you 

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:31.850
 So really recommend a pump 

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:33.199
 to take a bump and now not too 

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:34.910
 think oh come, I hope so 

00:05:33.199 --> 00:05:41.410
 quickly the whole body with five 

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:44.570
 so it makes you prefer 

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:48.950
 clean and always one by one 

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:52.479
 individually her whole body quickly 

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:54.560
 Krems but everything full of spots have 

00:05:52.479 --> 00:05:55.760
 Unfortunately, the camera has not more 

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:58.070
 recorded 

00:05:55.760 --> 00:06:01.039
 I hope you liked the video 

00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:04.190
 and leave a comment if you guys 

00:06:01.039 --> 00:06:07.240
