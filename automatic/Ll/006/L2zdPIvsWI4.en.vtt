00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.149
 hello together and welcome 

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:04.859
 for my december favorites 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:06.779
 My name is actually my name 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:08.970
 not to turn this video and 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.590
 to turn instant year's favorites and 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.090
 then I sat down like that 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.920
 the products for the year's favorites 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.230
 picked out and I noticed it 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.270
 There are so many things I have in december 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.250
 rediscovered and I tell you about it 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.359
 just wanted to tell what that 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.220
 I just could not help but 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.810
 to turn this video and promised 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.300
 the next will be the year 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.890
 But video favorites are the first thing 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.510
 I have for you is here today with 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.730
 body butter and that which comes from 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.899
 twickel or trekking now I want to 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.239
 still not sure each through 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.160
 also so disagree on the comments 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.260
 in any case, that is from ginger 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.350
 morning occupation and the smell 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.000
 is really so so good that I what 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.860
 me most of all this series 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.710
 I like it there is a shower gel and 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.360
 I have a bodylotion of the em 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.090
 for five euros 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:57.870
 and that's definitely not the way it is now 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:59.940
 Nursing all body butter that is 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.649
 Moves the world but there is a real one 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.719
 nice product so donate nice 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:06.240
 a lot of moisture is absorbed quickly 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:08.220
 i really like the consistency and 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.020
 the smell is just for my nose 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.400
 at least the absolute madness 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.950
 it's a little bit in the direction 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.299
 Like Ginger Sparkle this is this limited 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.189
 edition from the body shop with this 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.710
 gingerbread man so it smells like that too 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:21.360
 funny and fresh but i think so 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.460
 even find the smell here 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.229
 only the consistency is a little better 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.000
 just do not care as well as with the 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:29.460
 body shop bolivard it but you pay 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.930
 but a little less that too 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.040
 Next thing I have you and I bet 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.200
 I am getting a lot of you 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.000
 Unfortunately, contradicting is a flop 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.340
 Product for me and that is the case 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.869
 lea eyes make up remover and that 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.360
 oil-free of the two 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:44.040
 I think the product is way too strong 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.320
 deformed and I do not like it that way 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.509
 felt to my eyes 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.310
 I do not like it and it burns with me 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:52.350
 in the eyes not so super 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.640
 bad but i just had it 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.960
 eyes make up remover the goods were around 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.579
 a lot better and they have too 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.469
 cost about as much 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:00.360
 yes he removes relatively well I would 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:01.860
 say but that's just not me 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.049
 worth the burn in the eyes and me 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.210
 does not like the smell so unfortunately no 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:08.280
 product I'll buy after 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.550
 then I have something I totally 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.410
 can fulfill 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:13.660
 and the beautiful thing is right 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:15.850
 cheap and that is one of 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.230
 i think that essens long lasting 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:18.400
 The lipsticks are looking again 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:18.970
 after and write down in the 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.550
 infobox 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:23.350
 I have the color 07 natural beauty 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:24.790
 but you can count on it 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:26.680
 that i am not the last color i have 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:29.410
 bought from this series because I 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:33.100
 I'm so excited about the consistency and 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:34.660
 from the price of 225 lipstick that 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:36.610
 is really little the color can be 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:38.830
 really good without a mirror on wear so 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:40.870
 if you take a lip care stick 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:42.490
 really a lipstick just like that 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.900
 wanted to wear during the day 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:45.220
 without somehow complicated now 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:48.010
 to have to mature mirror or something 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.480
 Perfect color today is still at dm and 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:50.050
 it will be a few more colors 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.030
 come 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:54.220
 I think that the color selection is very 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:56.380
 So at least when I succeeded the 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:58.030
 in the color only seven has bought 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:59.530
 I noticed there were many colors 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:01.540
 I really liked it and 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:03.670
 I hope I will from the others 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:06.130
 colors and be as enthusiastic as 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:08.170
 of a paint products two pieces and 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:10.390
 unfortunately they both come from kiko and be 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:12.880
 it's such a face care here 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:15.010
 I once had this with cells of water 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:16.840
 I also bought it from kiko 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:18.880
 fortunately relatively strong 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:21.400
 used up and I 'm sorry 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:24.160
 cleansing euro bought both was even 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:28.390
 not so cheap so around the eight 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:30.760
 euro per vial okay and I found 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:32.920
 you are with what totally strong 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:34.810
 it just is not overflowing 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:37.120
 Well, there is this example 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:38.530
 l'oreal with cells of water that cleanses 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:38.950
 I find better and more thorough and 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:40.989
 more accurate 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:42.780
 that is also better packed so 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:45.130
 maybe you can recognize it 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:46.510
 this is a bit difficult and 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:48.580
 Unleashed you have to stop the waterbed 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:50.350
 put on it and then pump and thereby 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:52.870
 always splashes a little bit 

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:56.080
 out and, strangely, the 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:57.640
 liquid is really money if 

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:00.430
 she dries on here and sees that 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:01.780
 really nasty from so unfortunately nothing at all 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:04.300
 no case what to buy 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:05.890
 will and tired I think cleansing 

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:07.720
 I even worse that is again 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:09.160
 very strongly defined I do not think so 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:10.810
 that it cleans very well and me 

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.730
 I expected the oil to be mine 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:14.800
 whole make up in a wipe handy 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:16.390
 from the face down and I believe 

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:17.459
 not that I'll need it on 

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:19.650
 I dont know if I 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:21.569
 or anyone will 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:23.759
 maybe he would prefer it 

00:04:21.569 --> 00:04:25.319
 I like it next what I have here 

00:04:23.759 --> 00:04:26.490
 is a powder received casually 

00:04:25.319 --> 00:04:28.289
 I and I have a lot of it 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:30.569
 happy it comes from chanel and 

00:04:28.289 --> 00:04:33.720
 Although it is this turkey universal 

00:04:30.569 --> 00:04:35.509
 compact supercool packed yes means clearly 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:38.849
 You also pay for the packaging 

00:04:35.509 --> 00:04:40.440
 with mirror and so and honestly as 

00:04:38.849 --> 00:04:42.000
 I have used for the first time 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:45.240
 and in the mirror looked white 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.130
 little hockey 95 euro puller would have that 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:49.229
 but also brought in the course of the 

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:51.120
 first day had made real 

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:52.889
 I did not have a single time when I did that 

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:54.360
 applied powder in the morning later 

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:56.479
 somehow the feeling I would have to 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:58.320
 Powder so it really lasts a long time 

00:04:56.479 --> 00:05:00.419
 second, even if you are a bit 

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:02.310
 wearing more of it does not look stupid 

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:03.870
 so there is nothing to be dulled out 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:05.759
 the powder is really very fine 

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:08.669
 I always have it with a brush 

00:05:05.759 --> 00:05:10.500
 applied I make just prefer and 

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:12.630
 that worked very well so you 

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:14.340
 do not take it too much now and 

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:16.110
 then it looks so cheesy somehow 

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:17.819
 except that it 's just really 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:19.860
 a nice product and then I have 

00:05:17.819 --> 00:05:23.430
 only top products here and once 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:25.409
 from kodály the most rising cream and 

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:27.780
 Although it is the type of skin for all of me 

00:05:25.409 --> 00:05:29.430
 think the price is now for kodály 

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:30.750
 not even as bad as it costs 

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:32.250
 16 euro 90 

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:33.990
 if I remember correctly 

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:35.430
 you'll get half for if 

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:37.380
 you in this pharmacy history 

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:39.150
 reminds donated neither too little 

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:41.669
 moisture still too much 

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:43.469
 the 40 just really really good on 

00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:43.979
 the skin on it moves relatively quickly 

00:05:43.469 --> 00:05:45.780
 on 

00:05:43.979 --> 00:05:48.449
 The skin feels really soft afterwards 

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:50.039
 and she actually looks somehow 

00:05:48.449 --> 00:05:52.650
 a little bit different from a bit 

00:05:50.039 --> 00:05:55.199
 brighter and more plump you can say 

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:56.400
 it is imagination but I am like that 

00:05:55.199 --> 00:05:58.740
 What's your pleasure and I have 

00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:00.360
 actually the feeling and what else for 

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:01.830
 the cream speaks my brother i had 

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:03.599
 Here's the neck so ne dry properly 

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:05.190
 Kennedy was totally rough and many 

00:06:03.599 --> 00:06:05.789
 By contrast, products do not have anything at all 

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:08.159
 helped 

00:06:05.789 --> 00:06:08.880
 I have the cream on it once 

00:06:08.159 --> 00:06:11.639
 carried 

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:13.530
 the next day this place was gone and 

00:06:11.639 --> 00:06:15.659
 somehow that's more 

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:17.789
 convinced of the cream here are unfortunately 

00:06:15.659 --> 00:06:19.110
 only 40 milliliters inside but man 

00:06:17.789 --> 00:06:20.699
 really only needs very little of it 

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:23.340
 So somehow the cream is very 

00:06:20.699 --> 00:06:24.539
 rich and that is why it is still 

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:25.320
 very much in there though I have them now 

00:06:24.539 --> 00:06:27.150
 already a 

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:28.710
 I think what I use it 

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:30.360
 also marc is that it is so right 

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:32.100
 uncomplicated cream is this for all 

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:33.930
 skin types you know you do not do that 

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:36.540
 really something wrong with and as 

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:37.950
 Last but not least, such luxury care 

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:39.840
 if I call that I have a whole 

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:42.060
 series of child stars and I am from 

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:43.320
 All three products absolutely thrilled 

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:46.950
 and totally satisfied with it 

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:50.610
 I tried the nut rita me 

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:52.980
 conditioner here the shampoo bazaar 1 it 

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:54.780
 There are two more and that's what 

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:57.210
 just fell off it is the h 

00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:59.310
 Mask this is this note rite mika mask 

00:06:57.210 --> 00:07:00.900
 I think all three products hold 

00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:02.640
 really what they promise when I am 

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:03.780
 The shampoo you used then feels 

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:05.670
 the hair is really that kinda 

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:07.350
 cleaned differently than me 

00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:10.110
 usually from my drugstore 

00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:12.300
 So I'm used to bubbly 

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:14.130
 a bit of soap or something like that 

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:15.750
 squeaky clean but feels 

00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:16.560
 really good that not now somehow 

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:19.410
 dry 

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:21.240
 and if I afterwards the conditioner or 

00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:23.970
 the hamas wear then I have somehow 

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:25.530
 a better feeling than could 

00:07:23.970 --> 00:07:27.690
 the conditioner and the hamas are fine 

00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:29.340
 better penetrate the hair and the 

00:07:27.690 --> 00:07:30.930
 Hair feel when I have these two 

00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:34.440
 I really also used products 

00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:36.780
 extremely silky and smooth and supple 

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:38.970
 and they are shining even more 

00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:40.980
 guaranteed silicones are mine 

00:07:38.970 --> 00:07:43.110
 Personally, it does not matter as long as the hair 

00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:45.870
 look good and stay healthy halt 

00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:47.490
 I just believe some hair types 

00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:49.290
 silicones do not harm others 

00:07:47.490 --> 00:07:50.520
 So maybe somebody should 

00:07:49.290 --> 00:07:52.770
 someone of you looking for 

00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:54.090
 really luxurious haircare then be 

00:07:52.770 --> 00:07:57.090
 I can definitely do the series 

00:07:54.090 --> 00:07:58.650
 recommend however finished if I the 

00:07:57.090 --> 00:08:00.510
 I've only used up things 

00:07:58.650 --> 00:08:02.250
 once such a theory products continue 

00:08:00.510 --> 00:08:04.050
 use because when I think about it 

00:08:02.250 --> 00:08:05.210
 Again and again these expensive products 

00:08:04.050 --> 00:08:07.650
 nachzukaufen 

00:08:05.210 --> 00:08:09.210
 thank you for watching how 

00:08:07.650 --> 00:08:10.740
 The next video is promised 

00:08:09.210 --> 00:08:12.510
 every fall of the year favorites video 

00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:14.580
 I'll be right after that 

00:08:12.510 --> 00:08:15.270
 Turn it all right and see you next 

00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:16.800
 times 

00:08:15.270 --> 00:08:19.670
 well and still a good slip into 

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:19.670
 year 2014
