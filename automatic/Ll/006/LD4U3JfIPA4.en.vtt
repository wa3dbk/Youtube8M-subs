Beaver quick but it give me a force and
a<00:02:56.620> fifth-place<00:02:57.010> so<00:02:57.400> it's<00:02:57.579> not<00:02:57.760> so<00:02:57.939> bad<00:02:58.120> but<00:02:58.560> now

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
a fifth-place so it's not so bad but now

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.190 
a fifth-place so it's not so bad but now
I'm<00:02:59.799> more<00:03:00.340> confident<00:03:00.730> with<00:03:00.909> my<00:03:01.060> ski<00:03:01.299> and<00:03:01.480> it's

00:03:07.589 --> 00:03:07.599
