00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
be placed here I've actually there's a

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.580 
be placed here I've actually there's a
little<00:01:31.850> tab<00:01:32.850> here<00:01:33.240> that<00:01:33.270> can<00:01:33.810> velcro<00:01:34.229> to<00:01:34.350> here

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
little tab here that can velcro to here

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.609 
little tab here that can velcro to here
but<00:01:34.829> it's<00:01:35.040> just<00:01:35.130> so<00:01:35.670> many<00:01:36.240> things<00:01:37.079> it<00:01:37.409> takes

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
but it's just so many things it takes

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.830 
but it's just so many things it takes
you<00:01:37.799> you<00:01:38.400> know<00:01:38.520> a<00:01:38.759> minute<00:01:39.150> to<00:01:39.299> get<00:01:39.420> just<00:01:39.780> to

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
you you know a minute to get just to

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.080 
you you know a minute to get just to
your<00:01:40.079> unit<00:01:40.409> after<00:01:40.950> you<00:01:41.400> zip<00:01:41.670> all<00:01:41.909> of<00:01:42.210> that<00:01:42.390> up

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.090 
your unit after you zip all of that up

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:47.780 
your unit after you zip all of that up
velcro<00:01:45.090> it<00:01:45.270> and<00:01:45.509> I<00:01:46.079> just<00:01:46.649> it's<00:01:47.159> a<00:01:47.490> little

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
velcro it and I just it's a little

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.420 
velcro it and I just it's a little
overkill<00:01:48.600> in<00:01:48.899> my<00:01:49.229> opinion<00:01:49.710> so<00:01:49.890> I<00:01:49.920> wish<00:01:50.220> they

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
overkill in my opinion so I wish they

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.300 
overkill in my opinion so I wish they
would<00:01:50.610> have<00:01:50.659> cut<00:01:51.659> this<00:01:51.899> or<00:01:52.259> left<00:01:52.560> this<00:01:52.799> part

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
would have cut this or left this part

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.100 
would have cut this or left this part
out<00:01:53.549> I<00:01:53.880> was<00:01:54.180> thinking<00:01:54.479> about<00:01:54.570> possibly

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
out I was thinking about possibly

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.330 
out I was thinking about possibly
getting<00:01:55.950> a<00:01:56.280> razor<00:01:57.119> and

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:58.340 
getting a razor and

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.319 
getting a razor and
cutting<00:01:59.090> this<00:01:59.270> portion<00:02:00.140> off<00:02:00.490> but<00:02:01.490> you<00:02:01.939> know<00:02:02.060> in

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:02.329 
cutting this portion off but you know in

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:05.200 
cutting this portion off but you know in
here<00:02:02.780> is<00:02:03.140> where<00:02:03.500> I<00:02:03.530> store<00:02:03.860> the<00:02:04.100> AR<00:02:04.460> cards<00:02:04.820> and

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.210 
here is where I store the AR cards and

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:07.179 
here is where I store the AR cards and
if<00:02:05.329> I<00:02:05.479> did<00:02:05.689> and<00:02:06.110> these<00:02:06.259> days<00:02:06.500> they<00:02:06.710> might<00:02:06.950> fall

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:07.189 
if I did and these days they might fall

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:10.650 
if I did and these days they might fall
out<00:02:07.220> so<00:02:07.460> I<00:02:07.759> don't<00:02:08.149> know<00:02:08.390> I'm<00:02:08.840> a<00:02:09.259> little<00:02:09.470> torn

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:10.660 
out so I don't know I'm a little torn

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:14.650 
out so I don't know I'm a little torn
this<00:02:11.660> little<00:02:11.959> pouch<00:02:12.140> really<00:02:12.970> it's<00:02:13.970> nice<00:02:14.239> you

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.040 
can't fit anything in here really other
than<00:02:16.550> the<00:02:16.700> AR<00:02:16.910> card<00:02:17.180> so<00:02:17.360> I<00:02:17.390> assume<00:02:17.720> that<00:02:17.930> that's

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.050 
than the AR card so I assume that that's

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:21.960 
than the AR card so I assume that that's
what's<00:02:19.010> supposed<00:02:19.250> to<00:02:19.430> go<00:02:19.550> in<00:02:19.700> there<00:02:19.819> so<00:02:20.590> again

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
what's supposed to go in there so again

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:25.900 
what's supposed to go in there so again
it's<00:02:22.970> a<00:02:23.120> really<00:02:23.690> nice<00:02:23.840> quality<00:02:24.200> case<00:02:24.709> I<00:02:25.040> like<00:02:25.790> I

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
it's a really nice quality case I like I

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:27.670 
it's a really nice quality case I like I
picked<00:02:26.300> this<00:02:26.390> up<00:02:26.569> at<00:02:26.750> Toys<00:02:26.959> R<00:02:27.110> Us<00:02:27.170> with<00:02:27.470> it<00:02:27.560> and

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
picked this up at Toys R Us with it and

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.539 
picked this up at Toys R Us with it and
say<00:02:27.800> already<00:02:29.590> when<00:02:30.590> I<00:02:30.620> purchased<00:02:31.130> the<00:02:31.250> unit

00:02:31.539 --> 00:02:31.549 
say already when I purchased the unit

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:34.539 
say already when I purchased the unit
and<00:02:31.730> I<00:02:32.569> mean<00:02:33.170> it's<00:02:33.590> ok<00:02:33.950> and<00:02:34.130> it's<00:02:34.220> what<00:02:34.459> I've

00:02:34.539 --> 00:02:34.549 
and I mean it's ok and it's what I've

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:36.900 
and I mean it's ok and it's what I've
mainly<00:02:35.030> been<00:02:35.180> using<00:02:35.540> it's<00:02:35.810> a<00:02:35.900> little<00:02:36.200> bulky

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:36.910 
mainly been using it's a little bulky

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:41.199 
mainly been using it's a little bulky
and<00:02:37.989> I<00:02:39.190> like<00:02:40.190> I<00:02:40.250> said<00:02:40.430> I<00:02:40.459> had<00:02:40.850> some<00:02:41.030> problems

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:41.209 
and I like I said I had some problems

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:44.470 
and I like I said I had some problems
with<00:02:41.510> just<00:02:42.110> how<00:02:42.260> complex<00:02:43.130> it<00:02:43.340> is<00:02:43.430> getting<00:02:44.150> to

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
with just how complex it is getting to

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:47.259 
with just how complex it is getting to
the<00:02:44.569> actual<00:02:45.220> slot<00:02:46.220> where<00:02:46.519> you<00:02:46.700> could<00:02:46.880> store

00:02:47.259 --> 00:02:47.269 
the actual slot where you could store

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:50.289 
the actual slot where you could store
your<00:02:47.299> unit<00:02:47.890> so<00:02:48.890> I<00:02:48.920> end<00:02:49.220> up<00:02:49.280> just<00:02:49.340> doing<00:02:49.940> that

00:02:50.289 --> 00:02:50.299 
your unit so I end up just doing that

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:52.210 
your unit so I end up just doing that
leaving<00:02:50.840> that<00:02:50.930> piece<00:02:51.200> off<00:02:51.410> just<00:02:51.680> to<00:02:51.830> save<00:02:52.040> me

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
leaving that piece off just to save me

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:55.690 
leaving that piece off just to save me
one<00:02:52.750> one<00:02:53.750> step<00:02:54.049> I<00:02:54.260> tried<00:02:54.560> going<00:02:54.980> like<00:02:55.160> this<00:02:55.370> and

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
one one step I tried going like this and

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.570 
one one step I tried going like this and
leaving<00:02:56.000> it<00:02:56.120> unzipped<00:02:56.660> but<00:02:57.650> just<00:02:58.340> doesn't

00:02:58.570 --> 00:02:58.580 
leaving it unzipped but just doesn't

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:03.280 
leaving it unzipped but just doesn't
doesn't<00:02:58.970> feel<00:02:59.299> right<00:02:59.480> so<00:03:00.160> it's<00:03:01.160> an<00:03:01.310> ok<00:03:01.640> case<00:03:02.290> if

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:03.290 
doesn't feel right so it's an ok case if

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:05.099 
doesn't feel right so it's an ok case if
you<00:03:03.500> needed<00:03:03.829> something<00:03:04.100> smaller<00:03:04.609> and

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:05.109 
you needed something smaller and

00:03:05.109 --> 00:03:06.940 
you needed something smaller and
something<00:03:06.109> to<00:03:06.200> hold<00:03:06.320> your<00:03:06.470> games<00:03:06.739> and

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 
something to hold your games and

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:09.789 
something to hold your games and
everything<00:03:07.190> so<00:03:07.640> I<00:03:08.140> recommend<00:03:09.140> it<00:03:09.290> but<00:03:09.470> I<00:03:09.680> just

00:03:09.789 --> 00:03:09.799 
everything so I recommend it but I just

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:11.620 
everything so I recommend it but I just
wish<00:03:10.250> this<00:03:10.760> would<00:03:10.970> have<00:03:11.060> been<00:03:11.150> designed<00:03:11.450> a

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:11.630 
wish this would have been designed a

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:13.780 
wish this would have been designed a
little<00:03:11.780> bit<00:03:12.019> better<00:03:12.220> that's<00:03:13.220> it<00:03:13.400> thanks<00:03:13.670> for
