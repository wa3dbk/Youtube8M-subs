00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:10.469
 good morning you like a piece of lemon 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:14.340
 then you grow lemond for yourself 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:16.290
 at home you can grow a lemon I'm nobody 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.200
 never recommend brewing in the house 

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:22.349
 lemon tangerine or something else from this 

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:24.149
 series for what reason it's nice to have here 

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:27.149
 is a tree on which lemons grow 

00:00:24.149 --> 00:00:29.369
 take some tea to pick lemon 

00:00:27.149 --> 00:00:31.739
 fights his cut and put in h 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.920
 in order to do this 

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:37.109
 it takes a lot of effort 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:37.710
 from this your plants are not for ours 

00:00:37.109 --> 00:00:40.019
 apartments 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:43.589
 why are living conditions not optimal 

00:00:40.019 --> 00:00:45.809
 for citrus because they need ice 

00:00:43.589 --> 00:00:49.530
 calm they need cold winters cold 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:51.109
 it is low plus 10-12 degrees and create 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.999
 this temperature at room temperature 

00:00:51.109 --> 00:00:56.190
 extremely hard and if we ca n't 

00:00:53.999 --> 00:00:58.320
 create that temperature from here and that's it 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.850
 the woes of these plants do not get 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.760
 normal rest period 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:05.880
 the plant does not feel very well 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:09.090
 well they are not rested and the whole cycle 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:11.490
 developmental disrupted besides these 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.780
 plants are affected by all possible 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.350
 pests that usually 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:18.350
 there is a home environment 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:21.920
 what kind of water do cowards need 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:24.560
 at the same time they can be seen and 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:27.540
 buds are open flowers 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:29.969
 young fruit in the bud and here we have 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.430
 you see a faded flower and now 

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:33.899
 all the little flesh to and the fruit on 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.509
 different stages of development 

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:38.880
 the first plant should stand 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.409
 necessarily in the light because otherwise 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.460
 it will not reduce on not and 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:46.799
 lemons we need it just for the sake of it 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:49.109
 the second is to look very carefully for 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:51.780
 those pests that can sit on 

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:54.750
 this tree start eating leaves we are not 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.460
 we get the fruit must be once a week 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.219
 carefully examine the plants and 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.810
 whether to look inside out 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:03.119
 spider mite and we talked many times 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.159
 what is a spider mite on a plant 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:07.010
 wound up along the central vein 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:10.130
 sure to be easy white 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:12.410
 since there is a lemon on it and we can't 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:14.180
 process it with toxic chemicals here 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:14.810
 will have to take advantage of folk 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.640
 by means 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:19.340
 although you know that I am not at all 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:22.190
 supporter of this if suddenly we noticed 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.120
 spider mite we take liquid for 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:26.360
 nail polish remover 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:29.800
 she is all acetone containing and wet 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:34.100
 we wipe cotton wool with the inside out of the elevator 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:36.410
 each sheet carefully examining and this 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:39.220
 we also repeat the procedure twice 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:42.080
 somewhere in 3 to 5 days because 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:43.820
 adults can come out visit 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:45.740
 climb the plant again sit down and 

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:46.690
 in fact, our first treatment 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:49.580
 go down the drain 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:52.880
 how to create citrus suitable 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:56.810
 condition for the winter of course you need to create 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:59.570
 some cool period for the plant 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:03.350
 here in the winter you have to in your apartment or 

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:05.780
 in the house choose the coldest window can 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:08.120
 be not insulate it specifically if you 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:10.100
 want to grow citrus fruit or if 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:12.590
 the house has some kind of cool veranda 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:14.270
 or the apartment has a balcony where you can 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:16.880
 create 10-12 degrees 

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:20.360
 there must bring your citrus 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:21.800

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:23.600

 calamondin is a little footie similar 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:41.480
 the mandarin is sour inside and 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:43.820
 sweet skin therefore such a fruit after
