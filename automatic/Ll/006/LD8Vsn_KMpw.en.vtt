00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:05.670
 hi to all of you guys and drink this 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:08.450
 new video is the ex o'shea 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:13.980
 finally after nine months I sell them 

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:15.780
 I find them the excitement of doing guides I repeat 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.600
 that my deduction was varied 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:21.779
 commitments as a social school in gyms 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:24.570
 also football so imagine going 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:27.779
 at school, then studying later in the morning 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:31.489
 lunch go to the gym of several a 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:35.480
 home then other football days then 

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:38.280
 alternating came a little difficult for me 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:41.520
 so I also stopped because not 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:46.860
 the 3ds succeeded 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:51.050
 the emulator though I may have found a 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:54.329
 method to record let's say on 3ds 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:56.699
 like you I will show you why maybe 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:59.190
 I'll do a guide on how to catch some 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:02.609
 let's say legendary of we put in y list 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.619
 that heaven since I then have every y 3ds 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:07.409
 but anyway he loves me that he is not 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:10.080
 a gameplay guide but tutorial on 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:13.080
 how to download let's try dz or friend 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:16.710
 not having downloaded zero then 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:18.720
 first let's go to the link that I put 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:22.500
 I am questioning here of income 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:26.490
 as then for those who already have pokémon 0 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:29.640
 micromino just first to download the 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:34.439
 patch if not because in the race where 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:36.659
 download download then monza va per 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:39.329
 of a windows on this million this 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:42.270
 because to me with the same one from these 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:45.270
 I live more in this video I will make you 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:50.130
 see how to add to this I want 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:53.730
 not even the micro of things come 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:56.670
 while of for example 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:02:00.240
 the backgrounds of the battles that it would be 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:03.740
 this parcel Speight overall pack then 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:07.650
 let's say in 3d that is the effect that was there 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:10.619
 su che non y credo is the 3d one 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:12.840
 we want sprite bach and then black and 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:15.690
 white beaten but that would be the stage 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:20.310
 which contains all objects 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:24.120
 in the backpack these things like the scenes of 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:26.310
 battle various things 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:29.400
 then there is this someone not acting from 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:32.810
 little and wants Mgr flight park that 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:35.900
 as you understand it would be a stage that 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:40.440
 something kind of the box but things 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:42.740
 but I haven't got a download 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:45.480
 once these four packages are unloaded 

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:48.540
 that the main one would be this 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:51.120
 which then you will get these four 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:54.180
 after after that network downloaded for 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:57.600
 download them obviously the biggest mi 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:03:00.000
 it seems that it was this guy that you 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:02.970
 here there was a nice can download more than 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:06.770
 an hour maybe I don't remember a lot though 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:10.459
 because they are so many images now you will understand 

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:14.160
 then first take pokémon z 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:18.150
 what you see and you take files out 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:23.340
 we impose z is this and will answer you 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:26.430
 this folder so did this 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:32.840
 take 1 2 and 3 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:37.110
 and do the same extract the files in bates 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:38.580
 of dumped and roads all of them 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:40.770
 you can put a folder as I have 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:43.709
 done me and how you want to do them a 

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:45.480
 various folders will reply 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:49.560
 this must not be done otherwise 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:52.800
 it's very easy to take of everyone 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:54.420
 let's start from the first the various images is 

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:57.810
 copy and replace it 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:04:01.720
 let's take these here as they are 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:06.310
 first type objects of white pokemon 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:13.710
 in the backpack and do so selected 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:19.150
 all of you make copies from the back 

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:23.160
 back now pokemon z graphics e 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:27.070
 let's go to pictures 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:28.150
 done this you paste it I don't 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:31.120
 I make fairies 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:34.060
 invade copes switch for everyone so yes 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:35.830
 replaces old ones and copies those 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:37.140
 new and replaces old ones with 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:41.170
 new ones 

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:44.740
 done this then the first goes with 

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:50.080
 then pictures of old white menu 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:53.680
 this one that would beat becks 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:05:01.330
 they would be backgrounds of copy all 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:05:04.330
 and paste them on batten becks fairies 

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:06.130
 copy in galles fiji ok as before 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:08.290
 he obviously already did so then 

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:11.200
 you will already see this but before they were a bit 

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:15.820
 different in the last these which are 

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:19.810
 so many butlers recopy all of them 

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:25.110
 see how many sons are too many are 

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:31.270
 all then to 740 images all of them 

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:34.360
 informed that I occupy I believe a lot indeed 

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:41.070
 there will be if you download and copy 

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:41.070
 paste all make copies you switch on 

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:49.270
 butler you will see that before there were typhus 

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:53.290
 just this 

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:56.260
 this was just those raidue 

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:58.670
 of but then you see that will be added 

00:05:56.260 --> 00:06:03.660
 many other summer years 

00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:07.800
 so what done is this done 

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:11.370
 you have to do for 3d and now for 

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:13.160
 play it just go here on game there 

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:16.590
 double click 

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:26.220
 I already started it a long time ago 

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:29.610
 play with it because mom because she doesn't want to 

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:30.980
 starting provinces more I lost 

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:33.980
 also google chrome 

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:33.980
 expect 

00:06:38.289 --> 00:06:43.540
 ok 

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:51.530
 here I'm sorry I didn't do very well 

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:52.730
 so mass a little boom ok i am 

00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:54.830
 went much further 

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:59.440
 I recommend this game because the 

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:59.440
 also very long history of two regions 

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:06.850
 look to give up some 3d sprites 

00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:19.280
 see how he knows while he really is a lot 

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:22.210
 cute with a game you then level e 

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:25.930
 up to 120 is one thing 

00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:28.820
 extraordinary for those who benefit, let's say 

00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:30.070
 watch the battles and then finish 

00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:33.200
 this guide 

00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:36.670
 then there are also those that you find by law 

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:39.950
 wanted master builder a lot of dust 

00:07:36.670 --> 00:07:43.370
 therefore, I consider it rather I believe that 

00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:46.130
 our guide will do it on pokémon 

00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:49.760
 iceland delivered you want me on which 

00:07:46.130 --> 00:07:52.670
 do it since as I have already said that 

00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:58.700
 they have one of the usual guides I wanted to do 

00:07:52.670 --> 00:08:01.310
 of some other guys so me 

00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:03.830
 he did n't even have problems 

00:08:01.310 --> 00:08:07.790
 of rescue etc novelty none 

00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:09.440
 problem so i hope this guide 

00:08:07.790 --> 00:08:12.290
 It was useful 

00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:15.610
 see you in a next video 

00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:15.610
 from the ex officio ciao
