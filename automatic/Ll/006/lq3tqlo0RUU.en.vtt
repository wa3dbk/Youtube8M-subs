00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
from my face and really there is no

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.200 
from my face and really there is no
technique<00:00:52.680> to<00:00:52.890> it<00:00:53.010> like<00:00:53.160> I<00:00:53.280> said<00:00:53.460> before<00:00:53.610> you

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
technique to it like I said before you

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.270 
technique to it like I said before you
can<00:00:54.239> curl<00:00:54.690> away<00:00:54.840> from<00:00:55.170> your<00:00:55.320> face<00:00:55.530> you<00:00:56.100> can

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
can curl away from your face you can

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.560 
can curl away from your face you can
curl<00:00:56.520> two<00:00:56.730> strands<00:00:57.030> away<00:00:57.180> from<00:00:57.329> your<00:00:57.449> phase

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
curl two strands away from your phase

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.510 
curl two strands away from your phase
two<00:00:57.840> strands<00:00:58.140> towards<00:00:58.649> your<00:00:58.739> face<00:00:58.949> it<00:00:59.219> really

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
two strands towards your face it really

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.639 
two strands towards your face it really
doesn't<00:00:59.850> matter<00:01:00.000> as<00:01:00.239> long<00:01:00.270> as<00:01:00.600> you<00:01:00.750> alternate

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
doesn't matter as long as you alternate

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.349 
doesn't matter as long as you alternate
from<00:01:01.859> time<00:01:02.100> to<00:01:02.250> time<00:01:02.280> because<00:01:02.879> if<00:01:03.059> you<00:01:03.149> have

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
from time to time because if you have

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:04.820 
from time to time because if you have
them<00:01:03.539> all<00:01:03.690> in<00:01:03.870> this<00:01:03.960> in<00:01:04.140> the<00:01:04.470> same<00:01:04.680> direction

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
them all in this in the same direction

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.580 
them all in this in the same direction
then<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:05.970> waves<00:01:06.180> would<00:01:06.479> look<00:01:06.689> really<00:01:07.140> neat

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
then the waves would look really neat

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.130 
then the waves would look really neat
and<00:01:07.830> for<00:01:08.369> this<00:01:08.520> look<00:01:08.880> we<00:01:09.060> want<00:01:09.330> really<00:01:09.600> messy

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
and for this look we want really messy

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.020 
and for this look we want really messy
wait<00:01:10.320> so<00:01:11.040> you<00:01:11.130> can<00:01:11.280> see<00:01:11.460> I'm<00:01:11.640> just<00:01:11.820> grabbing

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
wait so you can see I'm just grabbing

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.149 
wait so you can see I'm just grabbing
really<00:01:12.930> random<00:01:13.140> strands<00:01:13.619> of<00:01:13.680> hair<00:01:13.740> and

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
really random strands of hair and

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.640 
really random strands of hair and
curling<00:01:14.460> them<00:01:14.670> in<00:01:14.880> different<00:01:15.030> directions<00:01:15.650> and

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
curling them in different directions and

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.080 
curling them in different directions and
the<00:01:16.770> reason<00:01:17.100> I<00:01:17.220> don't<00:01:17.369> use<00:01:17.549> a<00:01:17.580> clamp<00:01:17.880> is

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
the reason I don't use a clamp is

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.570 
the reason I don't use a clamp is
because<00:01:18.570> using<00:01:19.500> a<00:01:19.590> clamp<00:01:19.950> gives<00:01:20.250> you<00:01:20.400> really

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
because using a clamp gives you really

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.120 
because using a clamp gives you really
nice<00:01:20.850> bouncy<00:01:21.689> curls<00:01:21.869> instead<00:01:22.380> of<00:01:22.530> waves<00:01:22.799> and

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
nice bouncy curls instead of waves and

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.830 
nice bouncy curls instead of waves and
actually<00:01:23.700> curling<00:01:24.119> it<00:01:24.210> around<00:01:24.479> the<00:01:24.630> curling

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
actually curling it around the curling

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.800 
actually curling it around the curling
iron<00:01:25.140> I<00:01:25.530> find<00:01:26.130> that<00:01:26.250> it<00:01:26.430> gives<00:01:26.640> you<00:01:26.820> nicer<00:01:27.570> kind

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
iron I find that it gives you nicer kind

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.800 
iron I find that it gives you nicer kind
of<00:01:27.900> Messier<00:01:28.259> waves<00:01:28.590> instead<00:01:29.040> of<00:01:29.630> really<00:01:30.630> neat

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
of Messier waves instead of really neat

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.600 
of Messier waves instead of really neat
curls<00:01:31.110> so<00:01:31.380> that's<00:01:31.560> why<00:01:31.740> I<00:01:31.770> don't<00:01:32.100> use<00:01:32.250> the<00:01:32.430> clam

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
curls so that's why I don't use the clam

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.880 
curls so that's why I don't use the clam
I<00:01:32.820> just<00:01:33.150> leave<00:01:33.479> my<00:01:33.689> hair<00:01:33.960> on<00:01:34.170> the<00:01:34.409> curling<00:01:34.740> iron

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
I just leave my hair on the curling iron

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.700 
I just leave my hair on the curling iron
for<00:01:35.340> about<00:01:35.630> three<00:01:36.630> to<00:01:36.659> five<00:01:36.990> seconds<00:01:37.619> it

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
for about three to five seconds it

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.319 
for about three to five seconds it
really<00:01:37.920> doesn't<00:01:38.220> take<00:01:38.369> that<00:01:38.579> long<00:01:38.640> and<00:01:39.119> then<00:01:39.299> I

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
really doesn't take that long and then I

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:42.230 
really doesn't take that long and then I
just<00:01:39.479> release<00:01:40.110> and<00:01:40.439> you<00:01:41.159> can<00:01:41.310> see<00:01:41.610> that<00:01:41.640> I've

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
just release and you can see that I've

00:01:42.240 --> 00:02:06.840 
just release and you can see that I've
got<00:01:42.600> these<00:01:42.869> really<00:01:43.140> nice<00:01:43.409> waves

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:06.850 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:09.249 

so<00:02:07.850> now<00:02:07.970> that<00:02:08.149> the<00:02:08.270> bottom<00:02:08.570> section<00:02:08.750> is<00:02:09.050> done

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:09.259 
so now that the bottom section is done

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:10.719 
so now that the bottom section is done
i'm<00:02:09.410> just<00:02:09.590> going<00:02:09.740> to<00:02:09.770> move<00:02:09.950> it<00:02:10.100> backwards

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729 
i'm just going to move it backwards

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:13.360 
i'm just going to move it backwards
behind<00:02:11.450> my<00:02:11.840> shoulders<00:02:12.260> and<00:02:12.440> then<00:02:13.010> i'm<00:02:13.190> going

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
behind my shoulders and then i'm going

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:15.820 
behind my shoulders and then i'm going
to<00:02:13.459> take<00:02:13.670> my<00:02:13.880> hair<00:02:14.150> down<00:02:14.180> from<00:02:14.990> my<00:02:15.110> top<00:02:15.320> section

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
to take my hair down from my top section

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:18.699 
to take my hair down from my top section
and<00:02:16.010> just<00:02:16.550> start<00:02:16.790> curling<00:02:17.060> again<00:02:17.450> for<00:02:18.350> my<00:02:18.470> top

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:18.709 
and just start curling again for my top

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:20.440 
and just start curling again for my top
section<00:02:19.280> there<00:02:19.520> are<00:02:19.730> just<00:02:20.000> a<00:02:20.120> couple<00:02:20.150> of

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
section there are just a couple of

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:22.690 
section there are just a couple of
strands<00:02:20.690> of<00:02:20.780> hair<00:02:20.840> which<00:02:21.020> i<00:02:21.350> did<00:02:21.670> use<00:02:22.670> the

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
strands of hair which i did use the

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.490 
strands of hair which i did use the
clamp<00:02:23.150> to<00:02:23.420> curl<00:02:23.630> it<00:02:23.810> just<00:02:24.080> to<00:02:24.170> get<00:02:24.320> a<00:02:24.350> little

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
clamp to curl it just to get a little

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.949 
clamp to curl it just to get a little
bit<00:02:24.709> more<00:02:24.830> volume<00:02:25.010> but<00:02:25.880> the<00:02:26.060> rest<00:02:26.300> of<00:02:26.480> the<00:02:26.720> hair

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:26.959 
bit more volume but the rest of the hair

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:29.530 
bit more volume but the rest of the hair
I<00:02:27.230> just<00:02:27.950> wrap<00:02:28.610> around<00:02:28.970> the<00:02:29.090> curling<00:02:29.300> iron

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
I just wrap around the curling iron

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:30.910 
I just wrap around the curling iron
instead<00:02:29.900> of<00:02:30.110> using<00:02:30.260> the<00:02:30.470> clamp<00:02:30.680> and

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
instead of using the clamp and

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:33.250 
instead of using the clamp and
especially<00:02:31.880> the<00:02:32.209> front<00:02:32.450> section<00:02:32.660> it's<00:02:33.020> really

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
especially the front section it's really

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.140 
especially the front section it's really
important<00:02:33.709> to<00:02:33.920> curl<00:02:34.160> away<00:02:34.370> from<00:02:34.820> your<00:02:34.970> face

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
important to curl away from your face

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:50.490 
important to curl away from your face
because<00:02:35.900> it<00:02:36.020> frames<00:02:36.290> the<00:02:36.410> face<00:02:36.500> nicer

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.110 

so<00:02:51.500> really<00:02:51.680> curling<00:02:52.129> the<00:02:52.219> top<00:02:52.430> section<00:02:52.670> is<00:02:53.000> the

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
so really curling the top section is the

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.089 
so really curling the top section is the
same<00:02:53.329> as<00:02:53.480> the<00:02:53.540> bottom<00:02:53.959> section<00:02:54.170> just<00:02:54.799> wrap

00:02:55.089 --> 00:02:55.099 
same as the bottom section just wrap

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:57.190 
same as the bottom section just wrap
your<00:02:55.129> hair<00:02:55.549> around<00:02:55.879> the<00:02:56.030> curling<00:02:56.090> iron<00:02:56.599> away

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 
your hair around the curling iron away

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.020 
your hair around the curling iron away
from<00:02:57.620> her<00:02:57.709> face<00:02:57.890> from<00:02:58.159> time<00:02:58.219> to<00:02:58.489> time<00:02:58.519> and

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 
from her face from time to time and

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:03.179 
from her face from time to time and
towards<00:02:59.359> your<00:02:59.450> face<00:02:59.599> from<00:02:59.870> time<00:03:00.230> to<00:03:00.799> time<00:03:01.030> and

00:03:03.179 --> 00:03:03.189 
towards your face from time to time and

00:03:03.189 --> 00:03:05.860 
towards your face from time to time and
of<00:03:04.189> course<00:03:04.220> don't<00:03:04.609> forget<00:03:04.760> about<00:03:05.180> the<00:03:05.480> back<00:03:05.629> of

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:05.870 
of course don't forget about the back of

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:14.949 
of course don't forget about the back of
the<00:03:06.109> head<00:03:13.090> so<00:03:14.090> now<00:03:14.180> that<00:03:14.329> the<00:03:14.450> site<00:03:14.629> is<00:03:14.659> done

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:14.959 
the head so now that the site is done

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:16.479 
the head so now that the site is done
I'm<00:03:15.139> going<00:03:15.290> to<00:03:15.349> move<00:03:15.439> on<00:03:15.620> to<00:03:15.650> the<00:03:15.950> other<00:03:16.159> side

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:16.489 
I'm going to move on to the other side

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:18.879 
I'm going to move on to the other side
and<00:03:16.849> then<00:03:17.420> once<00:03:17.659> that<00:03:17.780> is<00:03:18.019> all<00:03:18.200> done<00:03:18.530> I'm<00:03:18.709> just

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:18.889 
and then once that is all done I'm just

00:03:18.889 --> 00:03:20.710 
and then once that is all done I'm just
going<00:03:19.010> to<00:03:19.040> take<00:03:19.340> random<00:03:19.819> sections<00:03:20.209> of<00:03:20.329> hair<00:03:20.359> on

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:20.720 
going to take random sections of hair on

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:22.690 
going to take random sections of hair on
the<00:03:20.900> top<00:03:20.930> of<00:03:21.379> my<00:03:21.560> head<00:03:21.739> near<00:03:22.099> the<00:03:22.280> roots<00:03:22.489> and

I'm<00:03:23.359> just<00:03:23.540> going<00:03:23.629> to<00:03:23.720> curl<00:03:23.959> them<00:03:24.200> randomly

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:24.590 
I'm just going to curl them randomly

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:32.740 
I'm just going to curl them randomly
just<00:03:25.010> to<00:03:25.159> get<00:03:25.340> a<00:03:25.519> bit<00:03:25.939> more<00:03:26.060> volume<00:03:26.239> on<00:03:26.599> the<00:03:26.689> top

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:32.750 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:40.640

hair when this happens so now that the
curling<00:03:54.110> is<00:03:54.260> all<00:03:54.500> done<00:03:54.769> I'm<00:03:54.980> just<00:03:55.190> going<00:03:55.459> to

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:16.489 
and because I wanted a bit more texture

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:18.880 
and because I wanted a bit more texture
on<00:04:16.730> the<00:04:17.000> roots<00:04:17.359> of<00:04:17.510> my<00:04:17.720> head<00:04:17.989> I'm<00:04:18.170> just

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:25.910 
texturizing spray on the roots then I'm

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:27.850 
texturizing spray on the roots then I'm
just<00:04:26.060> massaging<00:04:26.510> it<00:04:26.810> all<00:04:26.900> in<00:04:27.140> and<00:04:27.530> you<00:04:27.710> will
