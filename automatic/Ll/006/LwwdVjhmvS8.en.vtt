00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:13.049
 good afternoon today I want 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:16.439
 elite recipe juiciness dumplings we 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:18.180
 we will use ice for cooking 

00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:21.180
 here's a test look threw for 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.779
 cooling water a few drops 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.779
 blood in ice 

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:32.759
 for stuffing in general ice water for 

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:35.489
 cooking dough I think used 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:39.079
 but recently I saw how to make stuffing 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:41.640
 juicy just add dalet instead of water 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:46.260
 night the first thing we do is knead 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:51.750
 I have a dough here a liter jar 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:54.450
 flour one egg and ice water so dough 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.750
 I kneaded it took 90 more 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:58.910
 you 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:02.400
 about 300 liters further I cover him 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:05.070
 a wet towel is important so that it does not 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:07.820
 In general, the principle of drying any dough 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:15.990
 know his ability to rest a little 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:18.540
 often we are ready to tank want to see one 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:21.240
 nuance when I watched this program 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.950
 of course that it was before the transfer of 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.620
 tv that is she was not very 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:29.840
 long and natural that were cut 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:34.860
 whale moments ie he shows himself 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:38.040
 and then how it ends but I was 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:43.799
 It is shown as not well maintained 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:46.409
 persists as quickly begins 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:48.570
 heat the flight if of course not there 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:52.610
 your next words may not be four 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:56.070
 hands and quickly did it all but i 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:59.130
 I try because yes now you are interfering with 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:02.520
 ice and become a fridge to play by 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:12.269
 the quantity that I need 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:14.220
 on well I just drive the fridge 1 

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:18.319
 Onion is the way I want to say more 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:21.079
 that the dough I did not salt forbidden 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:24.950
 so what you do not your stuffing and put it 

00:02:21.079 --> 00:02:27.769
 in the fridge and so i rolled out the dough 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:30.670
 subtle enough to eat me specifically 

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:34.540
 such a knob which is very good 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:44.030
 make a form without much effort 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:48.650
 You can continue to look with a cup 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:50.620
 make dumplings and see if your 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:56.239
 add water you would have now on 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:03:03.909
 the edge was going to some water as well due to 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:03:08.510
 the fact that we have ice here 

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:10.040
 the dough is juicy but not wet and not 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:13.120
 use a lot of flour when rolling 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:20.659
 test because it will be very hard and 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:23.530
 bazaar spit see nowhere droplets 

00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:23.530
 no liquid 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:34.030
 I took a completely small amount 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:36.170
 stuffing the second part in my fridge 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:38.540
 see to the end of work how she 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:47.360
 will there be there 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:51.260
 ice or turn into water so 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:54.470
 make dough like guys this 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:56.350
 I already took the last kvass 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:59.930
 in small pieces 

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:02.090
 growth tissue from anyway I melted 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:05.690
 but I want to say that there is one moment 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:08.720
 interestingly not knowing what you see 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:12.130
 some water anyway 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:15.770
 There is despite the fact that all my ice has melted 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:17.630
 there is no water at all you pulled in if you che 

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:20.269
 notice that on their own half a kilogram 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:22.910
 I'm crying I added 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:25.550
 but you made 300 grams of water that is 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:28.330
 a glass of ice a glass of water I poured a mold 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:30.889
 two dice I threw 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:34.879

00:04:34.879 --> 00:04:40.690
 boiled them in salted water added 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:44.270
 sour cream in the second saucepan for me 

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:45.710

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:49.550
