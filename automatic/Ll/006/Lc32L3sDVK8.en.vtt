know<00:01:41.540> where<00:01:42.540> it<00:01:43.280> came<00:01:44.280> from<00:01:44.340> he<00:01:44.820> goes<00:01:45.000> but<00:01:45.210> it

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
know where it came from he goes but it

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:46.609 
know where it came from he goes but it
looks<00:01:45.479> like<00:01:45.659> you've<00:01:45.840> had<00:01:45.960> a<00:01:46.020> brain<00:01:46.380> hemorrhage

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
looks like you've had a brain hemorrhage

looks like you've had a brain hemorrhage
they<00:01:47.369> explained<00:01:48.000> to<00:01:48.090> us<00:01:48.180> for<00:01:48.479> the<00:01:48.540> first<00:01:48.720> time

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
they explained to us for the first time

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.960 
they explained to us for the first time
what<00:01:49.200> this<00:01:49.350> coiling<00:01:49.860> procedure<00:01:50.340> was<00:01:50.700> that

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
what this coiling procedure was that

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.270 
what this coiling procedure was that
they<00:01:51.090> did<00:01:51.329> where<00:01:52.229> they<00:01:52.320> actually<00:01:52.560> take<00:01:53.009> little

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
they did where they actually take little

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.999 
they did where they actually take little
platinum<00:01:53.700> coils<00:01:54.060> and<00:01:54.240> they<00:01:54.990> looped<00:01:55.829> them

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
platinum coils and they looped them

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:59.149 
platinum coils and they looped them
inside<00:01:56.430> the<00:01:56.689> aneurysm<00:01:57.689> to<00:01:57.930> block<00:01:58.530> the<00:01:58.890> flow<00:01:59.070> of

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
inside the aneurysm to block the flow of

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:02.420 
inside the aneurysm to block the flow of
blood<00:01:59.460> so<00:02:00.180> the<00:02:00.509> it<00:02:00.750> in<00:02:01.200> essence<00:02:01.649> clots<00:02:02.040> it<00:02:02.280> and

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
blood so the it in essence clots it and

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.580 
blood so the it in essence clots it and
stops<00:02:02.820> him<00:02:03.030> from<00:02:03.060> bleeding<00:02:03.299> again<00:02:03.590> thinking

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
stops him from bleeding again thinking

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.289 
stops him from bleeding again thinking
about<00:02:04.799> Kaiser<00:02:05.280> Permanente<00:02:05.729> and<00:02:06.000> not<00:02:06.090> going<00:02:06.240> to
