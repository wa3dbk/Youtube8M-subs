 tight intense struggle around the earth flute 

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:09.230
 m still hope but no one this one 

00:00:10.799 --> 00:00:12.129
 hoodoo 

00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:13.120
 U.S. too 

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:14.499
 but this rise remains 

00:00:14.499 --> 00:00:17.609
 besides this what he likes 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.429
 this is going to 

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:26.429
 at least dear romanians mine but private 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.979
 everything goes like this 

00:00:29.979 --> 00:00:32.979
 why not silence 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.770
 it is this problem 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:43.430
 good 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:46.430
 why not in the eighth and then extradited 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.460
 these shortcomings no comment 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.399
 possession of his basement 

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:57.600
 Why 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.020
 com 5 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:02.020
 how is doing well 

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:08.260
 they want the state to rise 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:09.259
 2 

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:12.259
 at the end 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:16.550
 6 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:19.300
 so reasonable 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:21.340
 but I am 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:24.100
 currently the plates early 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:25.640
 cut 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.640
 as a percentage, which is likely to push in melee 

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:32.540
 it seems to me 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:35.540
 the moving average of this double cd 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:45.580
 Furthermore 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:48.580
 ap 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:52.490
 I'm listening 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
 I believe we are all born 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:03.870
 this show 

00:02:11.329 --> 00:02:13.259
 it was France that had made history 

00:02:13.259 --> 00:02:16.679
 however, m 

00:02:16.679 --> 00:02:19.679
 but the two towers do not lure 

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:31.769
 without too much trouble 

00:02:37.219 --> 00:02:40.219
 so for the pmu race

00:02:46.909 --> 00:02:49.909
 ap 

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:53.289
 I believe 

00:02:53.289 --> 00:02:56.289
 If it's possible 

00:02:57.159 --> 00:03:00.159
 merck is also conducive 

00:03:07.509 --> 00:03:09.279

00:05:15.849 --> 00:05:18.830
 m 

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:22.039
 then it is that they are seeing to believe it
