00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:19.670 
this is a Glock twenty four point six
inch<00:00:18.660> barrel<00:00:18.869> and<00:00:19.020> we're<00:00:19.140> gonna<00:00:19.230> be<00:00:19.380> shooting

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
inch barrel and we're gonna be shooting

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.400 
inch barrel and we're gonna be shooting
some<00:00:19.949> Buffalo<00:00:20.340> bore<00:00:20.900> heavy<00:00:21.900> ten<00:00:22.050> millimeter

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
some Buffalo bore heavy ten millimeter

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:23.810 
some Buffalo bore heavy ten millimeter
so<00:00:22.590> this<00:00:22.740> is<00:00:22.859> two<00:00:23.010> hundred<00:00:23.100> and<00:00:23.310> twenty<00:00:23.609> grain

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
so this is two hundred and twenty grain

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.019 
so this is two hundred and twenty grain
hard<00:00:24.660> cast<00:00:25.070> ten<00:00:26.070> millimeter<00:00:26.550> here's<00:00:26.880> the

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
hard cast ten millimeter here's the

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:28.310 
hard cast ten millimeter here's the
setup<00:00:27.240> we've<00:00:27.660> got<00:00:27.810> another<00:00:27.990> one<00:00:28.080> of<00:00:28.260> these

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
shoot them into these panels they all

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.770 
shoot them into these panels they all
get<00:01:29.280> this<00:01:29.460> sort<00:01:29.729> of<00:01:29.790> the<00:01:30.030> same<00:01:30.240> mushroom<00:01:30.420> kind

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
get this sort of the same mushroom kind

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.230 
get this sort of the same mushroom kind
of<00:01:30.869> shape<00:01:31.049> but<00:01:31.829> that's<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:32.250> 220<00:01:32.880> grain<00:01:33.030> hard

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
of shape but that's the 220 grain hard

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.870 
of shape but that's the 220 grain hard
cast<00:01:33.680> pretty<00:01:34.680> impressive<00:01:35.040> to<00:01:35.280> deform<00:01:35.640> it<00:01:35.759> like

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
cast pretty impressive to deform it like

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.920 
cast pretty impressive to deform it like
that<00:01:36.060> but<00:01:36.990> um<00:01:37.170> yeah<00:01:37.680> no<00:01:37.890> uh<00:01:38.420> no<00:01:39.420> actual

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
that but um yeah no uh no actual

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.870 
that but um yeah no uh no actual
penetration<00:01:40.170> it<00:01:40.560> didn't<00:01:40.770> go<00:01:40.890> through<00:01:41.159> but

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
penetration it didn't go through but

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.819 
penetration it didn't go through but
like<00:01:42.119> I<00:01:42.270> said<00:01:42.570> um<00:01:42.810> I<00:01:43.110> don't<00:01:43.619> know<00:01:43.710> how

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
like I said um I don't know how

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.050 
like I said um I don't know how
comfortable<00:01:44.100> it<00:01:44.369> would<00:01:44.490> be<00:01:44.579> to<00:01:44.700> have<00:01:44.820> one<00:01:44.970> of

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
comfortable it would be to have one of

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.249 
comfortable it would be to have one of
those<00:01:45.149> slamming<00:01:45.600> into<00:01:45.720> your<00:01:45.840> chest<00:01:46.079> like<00:01:46.200> that

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
those slamming into your chest like that

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.950 
those slamming into your chest like that
I<00:01:46.710> think<00:01:47.340> the<00:01:47.759> whole<00:01:47.909> the<00:01:48.329> whole<00:01:48.450> concept<00:01:48.810> of

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
I think the whole the whole concept of

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.179 
I think the whole the whole concept of
the<00:01:49.049> back<00:01:49.200> facing<00:01:49.560> interesting<00:01:49.920> is<00:01:50.040> I<00:01:50.130> think

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
the back facing interesting is I think

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:51.800 
the back facing interesting is I think
for<00:01:50.399> like<00:01:50.549> internal<00:01:50.880> injuries<00:01:51.299> so<00:01:51.479> that<00:01:51.659> you

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
for like internal injuries so that you
