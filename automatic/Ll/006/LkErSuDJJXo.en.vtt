as<00:01:02.489> very<00:01:02.699> hard<00:01:02.940> wood<00:01:03.239> in<00:01:03.420> actual<00:01:03.660> fact<00:01:03.750> oak<00:01:04.049> has

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
as very hard wood in actual fact oak has

as very hard wood in actual fact oak has
a<00:01:04.320> very<00:01:04.559> short<00:01:06.110> short<00:01:07.110> grain<00:01:07.500> in<00:01:07.710> it<00:01:07.860> so<00:01:08.070> okay

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
a very short short grain in it so okay

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.460 
a very short short grain in it so okay
in<00:01:08.880> my<00:01:09.150> experience<00:01:09.720> actually<00:01:09.990> tends<00:01:10.200> to<00:01:10.320> make

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
in my experience actually tends to make

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.609 
in my experience actually tends to make
quite<00:01:10.710> unreliable<00:01:11.330> shafts<00:01:12.330> for<00:01:12.960> tools<00:01:13.320> or

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:12.420 
your local wood merchant buy a new piece
of<00:02:11.430> ash<00:02:11.730> and

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
of ash and

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:14.910 
of ash and
have<00:02:12.940> them<00:02:13.150> fit<00:02:13.390> a<00:02:13.420> handle<00:02:13.900> onto<00:02:14.080> your<00:02:14.440> weapon

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
have them fit a handle onto your weapon

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.380 
have them fit a handle onto your weapon
again<00:02:15.129> because<00:02:15.400> the<00:02:15.489> expensive<00:02:16.030> part<00:02:16.209> of<00:02:16.330> the

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
again because the expensive part of the

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:21.030 
again because the expensive part of the
weapon<00:02:16.690> is<00:02:16.870> this<00:02:17.200> bit<00:02:17.409> the<00:02:17.709> metal<00:02:18.069> okay<00:02:18.610> so<00:02:20.040> yes

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
weapon is this bit the metal okay so yes

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.430 
weapon is this bit the metal okay so yes
they<00:02:21.430> do<00:02:21.489> get<00:02:21.730> damaged<00:02:22.090> in<00:02:22.180> use<00:02:22.390> but<00:02:22.930> remember

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
they do get damaged in use but remember

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.530 
they do get damaged in use but remember
so<00:02:23.650> do<00:02:23.830> all<00:02:24.040> weapons<00:02:24.489> and<00:02:24.700> all<00:02:24.819> equipment<00:02:25.330> get

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
so do all weapons and all equipment get

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.420 
so do all weapons and all equipment get
damaged<00:02:25.930> in<00:02:26.140> use<00:02:26.440> no<00:02:26.680> matter<00:02:26.830> how<00:02:27.069> good<00:02:27.310> you

you sharpen the sword it removes some
material<00:02:56.140> from<00:02:56.349> the<00:02:56.530> edge<00:02:56.680> and<00:02:57.190> I<00:02:57.940> have<00:02:58.480> some

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:58.690 
material from the edge and I have some

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:00.180 
material from the edge and I have some
antique<00:02:59.049> swords<00:02:59.349> in<00:02:59.440> my<00:02:59.560> collection<00:02:59.950> and<00:03:00.069> of

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.190 
antique swords in my collection and of

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:01.770 
antique swords in my collection and of
course<00:03:00.400> there<00:03:00.579> are<00:03:00.700> many<00:03:00.790> at<00:03:01.030> museums<00:03:01.510> where

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:01.780 
course there are many at museums where

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:03.119 
course there are many at museums where
you<00:03:01.900> can<00:03:02.049> see<00:03:02.230> they've<00:03:02.409> been<00:03:02.590> sharpened

00:03:03.119 --> 00:03:03.129 
you can see they've been sharpened

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:05.330 
you can see they've been sharpened
repeatedly<00:03:03.730> over<00:03:04.269> the<00:03:04.359> course<00:03:04.569> of<00:03:04.690> many<00:03:04.900> years

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
repeatedly over the course of many years

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.649 
repeatedly over the course of many years
and<00:03:06.340> you'll<00:03:06.549> notice<00:03:06.760> that<00:03:06.940> actually<00:03:07.209> the<00:03:07.540> edge

00:03:07.649 --> 00:03:07.659 
and you'll notice that actually the edge

00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:10.319 
and you'll notice that actually the edge
usually<00:03:08.319> it<00:03:08.440> seems<00:03:08.709> a<00:03:08.890> sort<00:03:09.040> of<00:03:09.099> wavy<00:03:09.670> edge<00:03:09.849> you

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:10.329 
usually it seems a sort of wavy edge you

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:11.819 
usually it seems a sort of wavy edge you
may<00:03:10.480> know<00:03:10.629> this<00:03:10.810> with<00:03:10.989> kitchen<00:03:11.409> knives<00:03:11.590> as

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:11.829 
may know this with kitchen knives as

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:13.440 
may know this with kitchen knives as
well<00:03:11.859> if<00:03:12.370> you<00:03:12.640> show<00:03:12.819> up<00:03:12.849> in<00:03:13.030> kitchen<00:03:13.329> knives

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:13.450 
well if you show up in kitchen knives

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:15.089 
well if you show up in kitchen knives
too<00:03:13.629> long<00:03:13.780> enough<00:03:13.989> eventually<00:03:14.349> they'll<00:03:14.920> get

00:03:15.089 --> 00:03:15.099 
too long enough eventually they'll get

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:18.240 
too long enough eventually they'll get
narrower<00:03:15.489> and<00:03:15.760> and<00:03:16.690> of<00:03:16.930> course<00:03:17.250> eventually

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.250 
narrower and and of course eventually

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:20.879 
narrower and and of course eventually
you<00:03:18.609> can<00:03:18.760> find<00:03:19.000> that<00:03:19.120> the<00:03:19.269> line<00:03:20.260> isn't<00:03:20.620> very

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:20.889 
you can find that the line isn't very

00:03:20.889 --> 00:03:22.620 
you can find that the line isn't very
straight<00:03:21.220> along<00:03:21.489> the<00:03:21.549> edge<00:03:21.760> or<00:03:21.970> isn't<00:03:22.450> the

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:22.630 
straight along the edge or isn't the

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:24.620 
straight along the edge or isn't the
same<00:03:22.840> curved<00:03:23.290> profile<00:03:23.799> as<00:03:23.950> it<00:03:24.069> was<00:03:24.190> originally

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630 
same curved profile as it was originally

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:27.420 
same curved profile as it was originally
and<00:03:25.630> you<00:03:26.290> know<00:03:26.410> you're<00:03:26.620> losing<00:03:26.950> material

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.430 
and you know you're losing material

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:29.339 
and you know you're losing material
every<00:03:27.609> time<00:03:27.760> you<00:03:27.879> sharpen<00:03:28.239> it<00:03:28.329> so<00:03:28.510> even<00:03:29.319> just

00:03:29.339 --> 00:03:29.349 
every time you sharpen it so even just

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:31.680 
every time you sharpen it so even just
resharpen<00:03:29.889> the<00:03:30.190> weapon<00:03:30.489> or<00:03:31.180> fixing<00:03:31.629> the

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:31.690 
resharpen the weapon or fixing the

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:34.110 
resharpen the weapon or fixing the
weapon<00:03:32.019> is<00:03:32.560> damaging<00:03:33.040> it<00:03:33.190> but<00:03:33.340> equally<00:03:33.790> in<00:03:33.910> use

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.120 
weapon is damaging it but equally in use

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:35.819 
weapon is damaging it but equally in use
of<00:03:34.150> course<00:03:34.629> it's<00:03:34.810> gonna<00:03:34.930> get<00:03:35.109> notches<00:03:35.650> it's

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:35.829 
of course it's gonna get notches it's

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:38.069 
of course it's gonna get notches it's
gonna<00:03:35.950> get<00:03:36.160> chips<00:03:36.549> and<00:03:37.090> of<00:03:37.389> course<00:03:37.599> wooden

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:02.109 
tough stuff a sword is not gonna go

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:03.689 
tough stuff a sword is not gonna go
straight<00:04:02.410> through<00:04:02.650> it<00:04:02.799> certainly<00:04:03.250> not<00:04:03.430> in<00:04:03.519> one

00:04:03.689 --> 00:04:03.699 
straight through it certainly not in one

00:04:03.699 --> 00:04:06.689 
straight through it certainly not in one
blow<00:04:03.940> even<00:04:04.810> if<00:04:04.930> you<00:04:05.049> laid<00:04:05.319> this<00:04:05.650> in<00:04:06.310> a<00:04:06.459> sort<00:04:06.669> of

00:04:06.689 --> 00:04:06.699 
blow even if you laid this in a sort of

00:04:06.699 --> 00:04:09.150 
blow even if you laid this in a sort of
workbench<00:04:07.329> and<00:04:07.599> took<00:04:07.930> a<00:04:08.079> sharp<00:04:08.560> sword<00:04:08.889> and

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:09.160 
workbench and took a sharp sword and

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:11.129 
workbench and took a sharp sword and
this<00:04:09.849> isn't<00:04:10.150> moving<00:04:10.299> around<00:04:10.750> and<00:04:10.959> someone

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:11.139 
this isn't moving around and someone

00:04:11.139 --> 00:04:12.869 
this isn't moving around and someone
isn't<00:04:11.349> trying<00:04:11.590> to<00:04:11.739> hit<00:04:11.919> you<00:04:12.040> at<00:04:12.160> the<00:04:12.220> time<00:04:12.430> and

00:04:12.869 --> 00:04:12.879 
isn't trying to hit you at the time and

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:14.789 
isn't trying to hit you at the time and
you<00:04:13.090> just<00:04:13.299> chopped<00:04:13.840> through<00:04:14.260> it<00:04:14.349> with<00:04:14.500> a<00:04:14.530> sword

00:04:14.789 --> 00:04:14.799 
you just chopped through it with a sword

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:16.560 
you just chopped through it with a sword
it<00:04:15.010> would<00:04:15.160> take<00:04:15.340> quite<00:04:15.549> a<00:04:15.699> lot<00:04:15.970> of<00:04:16.120> blows<00:04:16.329> to

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:16.570 
it would take quite a lot of blows to

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:18.839 
it would take quite a lot of blows to
finally<00:04:17.079> get<00:04:17.229> through<00:04:17.500> it<00:04:17.590> okay<00:04:17.769> think<00:04:18.549> about

00:04:18.839 --> 00:04:18.849 
finally get through it okay think about

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:20.610 
finally get through it okay think about
think<00:04:19.840> about<00:04:19.900> using<00:04:20.260> something<00:04:20.440> like<00:04:20.590> a

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:20.620 
think about using something like a

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:22.950 
think about using something like a
machete<00:04:21.010> for<00:04:21.400> example<00:04:21.820> to<00:04:22.030> chop<00:04:22.300> through<00:04:22.690> a

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:22.960 
machete for example to chop through a

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:24.530 
machete for example to chop through a
thick<00:04:23.919> branch

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:24.540 
thick branch

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:26.540 
thick branch
tree<00:04:24.810> it<00:04:25.020> takes<00:04:25.230> many<00:04:25.530> cuts<00:04:25.830> to<00:04:26.040> get<00:04:26.190> through

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:26.550 
tree it takes many cuts to get through

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:29.330 
tree it takes many cuts to get through
okay<00:04:27.390> and<00:04:27.870> that's<00:04:28.140> remember<00:04:28.830> that's<00:04:29.010> green

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:29.340 
okay and that's remember that's green

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:31.580 
okay and that's remember that's green
wood<00:04:29.580> that's<00:04:29.790> fresh<00:04:30.030> wood<00:04:30.240> dried<00:04:30.690> dried<00:04:31.320> wood

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:31.590 
wood that's fresh wood dried dried wood

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:32.000 
wood that's fresh wood dried dried wood
like<00:04:31.770> this

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:32.010 
like this

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:35.740 
like this
hand<00:04:32.670> over<00:04:32.880> hand<00:04:33.210> of<00:04:33.450> a<00:04:33.540> relatively<00:04:34.500> hard<00:04:34.770> wood

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:35.750 
hand over hand of a relatively hard wood

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:38.860 
hand over hand of a relatively hard wood
it's<00:04:36.750> much<00:04:36.990> more<00:04:37.200> difficult<00:04:37.560> to<00:04:37.620> get<00:04:37.770> through

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:38.870 
it's much more difficult to get through

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:43.310 
it's much more difficult to get through
lastly<00:04:39.870> I<00:04:39.900> will<00:04:40.050> say<00:04:40.530> that<00:04:41.480> one<00:04:42.480> danger<00:04:43.080> to

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:43.320 
lastly I will say that one danger to

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:46.430 
lastly I will say that one danger to
wooden<00:04:43.770> shafts<00:04:44.220> of<00:04:44.370> weapons<00:04:44.900> is<00:04:45.900> actually

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:46.440 
wooden shafts of weapons is actually

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:49.010 
wooden shafts of weapons is actually
snapping<00:04:47.400> in<00:04:47.910> using<00:04:48.300> this<00:04:48.390> deal<00:04:48.600> occasion

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:49.020 
snapping in using this deal occasion

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:50.690 
snapping in using this deal occasion
happen<00:04:49.290> so<00:04:49.410> if<00:04:49.560> you<00:04:49.710> taken<00:04:49.980> a<00:04:50.130> couple<00:04:50.400> of<00:04:50.490> heavy

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:50.700 
happen so if you taken a couple of heavy

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:52.850 
happen so if you taken a couple of heavy
blows<00:04:51.000> to<00:04:51.240> something<00:04:51.510> maybe<00:04:52.020> a<00:04:52.140> longer<00:04:52.470> shaft

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:52.860 
blows to something maybe a longer shaft

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:55.370 
blows to something maybe a longer shaft
of<00:04:53.130> weapon<00:04:53.400> whether<00:04:53.580> the<00:04:54.240> forces<00:04:54.630> of<00:04:54.840> leverage

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:55.380 
of weapon whether the forces of leverage

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:58.130 
of weapon whether the forces of leverage
and<00:04:55.620> torsion<00:04:56.130> are<00:04:56.370> greater<00:04:57.240> so<00:04:57.810> something

00:04:58.130 --> 00:04:58.140 
and torsion are greater so something

00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:59.990 
and torsion are greater so something
like<00:04:58.170> a<00:04:58.290> pole<00:04:58.530> axe<00:04:58.770> for<00:04:58.980> example<00:04:59.370> or<00:04:59.460> or<00:04:59.610> a<00:04:59.640> pipe

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:00.000 
like a pole axe for example or or a pipe

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.480 
like a pole axe for example or or a pipe
if<00:05:00.420> that's<00:05:00.720> taken<00:05:01.110> a<00:05:01.170> couple<00:05:01.410> of<00:05:01.620> chops<00:05:02.130> into

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:02.490 
if that's taken a couple of chops into

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:05.810 
if that's taken a couple of chops into
it<00:05:02.850> then<00:05:03.450> when<00:05:03.870> that<00:05:04.080> hits<00:05:04.410> something<00:05:04.820> it's

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:05.820 
it then when that hits something it's

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:08.750 
it then when that hits something it's
possible<00:05:06.450> that<00:05:06.600> through<00:05:06.840> giving<00:05:07.200> the<00:05:07.500> blow<00:05:07.800> it

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:08.760 
possible that through giving the blow it

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:10.550 
possible that through giving the blow it
may<00:05:09.060> be<00:05:09.360> enough<00:05:09.660> to<00:05:09.690> actually<00:05:10.020> snap<00:05:10.440> the

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:10.560 
may be enough to actually snap the

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:13.610 
may be enough to actually snap the
weapon<00:05:10.860> and<00:05:11.340> this<00:05:11.550> is<00:05:12.180> in<00:05:12.510> my<00:05:12.960> opinion<00:05:13.230> the

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:13.620 
weapon and this is in my opinion the

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:16.160 
weapon and this is in my opinion the
primary<00:05:14.340> purpose<00:05:14.820> of<00:05:15.030> these<00:05:15.450> things<00:05:15.840> at<00:05:16.110> the

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:16.170 
primary purpose of these things at the

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:19.220 
primary purpose of these things at the
side<00:05:16.470> here<00:05:16.920> which<00:05:17.910> are<00:05:18.150> called<00:05:18.360> land<00:05:18.840> gets<00:05:19.050> and

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:19.230 
side here which are called land gets and

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:21.230 
side here which are called land gets and
actually<00:05:19.530> if<00:05:19.710> you<00:05:19.950> look<00:05:19.980> at<00:05:20.280> pole<00:05:20.790> axe<00:05:21.030> for

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:21.240 
actually if you look at pole axe for

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:24.080 
actually if you look at pole axe for
example<00:05:21.720> or<00:05:22.140> certain<00:05:22.680> types<00:05:22.890> of<00:05:23.070> Partizan<00:05:23.910> or

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:24.090 
example or certain types of Partizan or

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:26.060 
example or certain types of Partizan or
halberd<00:05:24.510> they<00:05:24.960> often<00:05:25.260> have<00:05:25.440> Lang<00:05:25.650> gates<00:05:25.890> which

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:26.070 
halberd they often have Lang gates which

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:29.350 
halberd they often have Lang gates which
extend<00:05:26.580> very<00:05:26.820> far<00:05:26.970> down<00:05:27.510> the<00:05:27.720> shaft<00:05:27.990> and

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:29.360 
extend very far down the shaft and

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:31.460 
extend very far down the shaft and
partly<00:05:30.360> this<00:05:30.540> is<00:05:30.600> to<00:05:30.840> protect<00:05:31.140> them<00:05:31.290> from

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:31.470 
partly this is to protect them from

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:33.680 
partly this is to protect them from
being<00:05:31.710> chopped<00:05:32.070> up<00:05:32.280> and<00:05:32.490> damaged<00:05:32.880> so<00:05:33.180> badly<00:05:33.210> in

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:33.690 
being chopped up and damaged so badly in

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:37.070 
being chopped up and damaged so badly in
combat<00:05:34.020> but<00:05:34.470> also<00:05:34.710> it's<00:05:35.460> there<00:05:35.820> to<00:05:36.150> prevent

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:37.080 
combat but also it's there to prevent

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:38.900 
combat but also it's there to prevent
the<00:05:37.290> shaft<00:05:37.560> from<00:05:38.010> snapping

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:38.910 
the shaft from snapping

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:41.210 
the shaft from snapping
and<00:05:39.090> completely<00:05:39.750> snapping<00:05:40.590> into<00:05:40.710> pieces

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:41.220 
and completely snapping into pieces

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:43.430 
and completely snapping into pieces
during<00:05:41.370> combat<00:05:41.850> even<00:05:42.510> if<00:05:42.570> the<00:05:42.720> wood<00:05:42.900> did<00:05:43.110> snap

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:43.440 
during combat even if the wood did snap

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:45.110 
during combat even if the wood did snap
the<00:05:43.710> language<00:05:44.070> would<00:05:44.250> still<00:05:44.520> hold<00:05:44.700> it<00:05:44.880> in<00:05:44.970> one

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:45.120 
the language would still hold it in one

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:46.700 
the language would still hold it in one
piece<00:05:45.420> hopefully<00:05:45.960> for<00:05:46.110> long<00:05:46.260> enough<00:05:46.440> for<00:05:46.590> you

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:46.710 
piece hopefully for long enough for you

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:48.470 
piece hopefully for long enough for you
to<00:05:46.740> defend<00:05:47.100> yourself<00:05:47.520> and<00:05:47.610> kill<00:05:48.240> the<00:05:48.390> other

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:48.480 
to defend yourself and kill the other

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:50.600 
to defend yourself and kill the other
guy<00:05:48.720> I've<00:05:49.260> been<00:05:49.320> equally<00:05:49.920> they're<00:05:50.220> there<00:05:50.400> to

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:50.610 
guy I've been equally they're there to

the shaft through the language but all
the<00:06:06.120> way<00:06:06.270> down<00:06:06.540> so<00:06:06.750> you're<00:06:06.900> making<00:06:07.050> a<00:06:07.290> very

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:07.500 
the way down so you're making a very

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:09.230 
the way down so you're making a very
secure<00:06:07.830> attachment<00:06:08.460> between<00:06:08.700> the<00:06:08.850> head<00:06:09.060> and

secure attachment between the head and

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:11.360 
secure attachment between the head and
the<00:06:09.330> shafts<00:06:10.170> the<00:06:10.320> head<00:06:10.530> isn't<00:06:10.680> gonna<00:06:10.860> fly<00:06:11.100> off

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:11.370 
the shafts the head isn't gonna fly off

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:13.220 
the shafts the head isn't gonna fly off
it's<00:06:11.880> not<00:06:12.090> going<00:06:12.240> to<00:06:12.300> be<00:06:12.390> chopped<00:06:12.690> through<00:06:12.990> so

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:13.230 
it's not going to be chopped through so

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:15.770 
it's not going to be chopped through so
easily<00:06:13.410> and<00:06:13.830> it's<00:06:14.490> not<00:06:14.640> going<00:06:14.790> to<00:06:14.850> snap<00:06:15.210> in<00:06:15.450> use

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:15.780 
easily and it's not going to snap in use

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:18.800 
easily and it's not going to snap in use
so<00:06:16.140> easily<00:06:16.350> through<00:06:17.310> giving<00:06:17.580> blows<00:06:17.940> and<00:06:18.300> maybe

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:18.810 
so easily through giving blows and maybe

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:20.420 
so easily through giving blows and maybe
being<00:06:19.200> chopped<00:06:19.530> and<00:06:19.740> then<00:06:19.890> giving<00:06:20.190> blows
