00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:04.200 
so hi guys in this video let us go and

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.579 
so hi guys in this video let us go and
see<00:00:04.290> the<00:00:05.120> benchmark<00:00:06.120> of<00:00:06.330> both<00:00:06.569> these<00:00:06.779> Xperia<00:00:07.379> Z

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:07.589 
see the benchmark of both these Xperia Z

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:10.490 
see the benchmark of both these Xperia Z
and<00:00:07.859> Moto<00:00:08.490> G<00:00:08.820> and<00:00:09.120> let<00:00:09.690> us<00:00:09.780> compare<00:00:10.080> both<00:00:10.469> the

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
and Moto G and let us compare both the

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.400 
and Moto G and let us compare both the
phone<00:00:10.800> so<00:00:11.099> by<00:00:11.250> running<00:00:11.340> the<00:00:11.580> benchmark<00:00:12.410> okay

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
phone so by running the benchmark okay

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.799 
phone so by running the benchmark okay
so<00:00:13.920> first<00:00:14.400> of<00:00:14.549> all<00:00:14.639> I<00:00:14.700> am<00:00:14.759> running<00:00:14.940> on<00:00:15.179> let<00:00:15.690> us

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
so first of all I am running on let us

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.060 
so first of all I am running on let us
step<00:00:16.080> on<00:00:16.379> both<00:00:16.560> the<00:00:16.800> screens<00:00:17.609> at<00:00:17.760> a<00:00:17.820> time<00:00:17.970> okay

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:19.070 
step on both the screens at a time okay

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:26.650 
step on both the screens at a time okay
so<00:00:20.070> there's<00:00:20.310> no<00:00:21.109> initializing<00:00:24.980> so<00:00:25.980> let<00:00:26.130> us<00:00:26.160> see

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:26.660 
so there's no initializing so let us see

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:35.209 
so there's no initializing so let us see
which<00:00:27.660> one<00:00:27.840> comes<00:00:27.960> first<00:00:28.230> and<00:00:31.160> so<00:00:34.130> let<00:00:35.130> us

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
which one comes first and so let us

00:00:35.219 --> 00:03:42.699 
which one comes first and so let us
check

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:42.709 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:48.050 

so<00:03:43.709> what<00:03:43.950> does<00:03:44.040> he<00:03:44.159> completed<00:03:44.579> first

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:53.480 

so<00:03:48.660> here<00:03:49.140> we<00:03:49.830> have<00:03:50.010> our<00:03:50.540> four<00:03:51.920> okay<00:03:52.920> so<00:03:53.160> even

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:53.490 
so here we have our four okay so even

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:56.570 
so here we have our four okay so even
the<00:03:53.819> Sony<00:03:54.030> Xperia<00:03:54.150> Z<00:03:54.480> also<00:03:54.630> got<00:03:54.840> completed<00:03:55.580> so

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:56.580 
the Sony Xperia Z also got completed so

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:03.650 
the Sony Xperia Z also got completed so
we'll<00:03:56.819> see<00:03:56.970> where<00:03:57.330> one<00:03:58.290> is

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:03.660 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:10.760 

so<00:04:04.620> if<00:04:05.250> you<00:04:05.340> see<00:04:06.530> here<00:04:08.270> see<00:04:09.270> the<00:04:09.840> points<00:04:10.230> this

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:10.770 
so if you see here see the points this

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:14.150 
so if you see here see the points this
is<00:04:10.830> 12<00:04:11.280> 8<00:04:11.490> 5<00:04:11.730> 6<00:04:11.940> and<00:04:12.090> this<00:04:12.210> is<00:04:12.330> 17<00:04:12.690> 0<00:04:12.870> 1111<00:04:13.410> and<00:04:13.830> if

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:14.160 
is 12 8 5 6 and this is 17 0 1111 and if

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.479 
is 12 8 5 6 and this is 17 0 1111 and if
you<00:04:14.250> click<00:04:14.400> on<00:04:14.520> details<00:04:14.850> both<00:04:15.630> these<00:04:15.780> phones

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:16.489 
you click on details both these phones

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:21.920 
you click on details both these phones
see

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:21.930 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:24.379 

and<00:04:22.410> multitasking<00:04:23.310> capacity<00:04:23.820> this<00:04:23.970> is<00:04:24.030> having

00:04:24.379 --> 00:04:24.389 
and multitasking capacity this is having

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:25.790 
and multitasking capacity this is having
two<00:04:24.509> nine<00:04:24.660> one<00:04:24.690> zero<00:04:24.870> and<00:04:25.199> this<00:04:25.320> is<00:04:25.380> having<00:04:25.680> two

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:04.580 
what this is what we have and we run the

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:07.820 
what this is what we have and we run the
benchmarks<00:05:05.580> both<00:05:06.360> these<00:05:06.510> phones<00:05:06.720> so<00:05:07.229> it<00:05:07.620> is<00:05:07.710> up

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:07.830 
benchmarks both these phones so it is up

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:10.640 
benchmarks both these phones so it is up
to<00:05:07.860> you<00:05:08.039> you<00:05:08.490> decide<00:05:09.030> which<00:05:09.930> one<00:05:10.139> is<00:05:10.169> very<00:05:10.560> much

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:10.650 
to you you decide which one is very much

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:16.010 
to you you decide which one is very much
