materials<00:00:22.650> this<00:00:23.460> rock<00:00:23.730> I<00:00:23.880> thought<00:00:24.090> it<00:00:24.180> was

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
materials this rock I thought it was

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:25.759 
materials this rock I thought it was
North<00:00:24.449> Carolina<00:00:24.810> after<00:00:25.019> here<00:00:25.260> it's<00:00:25.350> Tennessee

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
North Carolina after here it's Tennessee

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.189 
North Carolina after here it's Tennessee
yeah<00:00:26.189> that's<00:00:26.609> right<00:00:26.849> since<00:00:27.150> we<00:00:27.390> about<00:00:27.570> 180

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
yeah that's right since we about 180

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.130 
yeah that's right since we about 180
tons<00:00:28.560> yeah<00:00:29.010> some<00:00:29.789> of<00:00:29.880> these<00:00:29.939> rocks<00:00:30.210> 5<00:00:30.449> 6<00:00:30.810> tons

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
tons yeah some of these rocks 5 6 tons

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.380 
tons yeah some of these rocks 5 6 tons
in<00:00:31.410> size<00:00:31.679> of<00:00:32.369> all<00:00:32.520> the<00:00:32.640> rock<00:00:32.850> work<00:00:33.090> they<00:00:33.210> say

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
in size of all the rock work they say

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.180 
in size of all the rock work they say
everything's<00:00:33.719> big<00:00:34.230> in<00:00:34.260> Texas<00:00:34.559> well<00:00:35.040> this

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
everything's big in Texas well this

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.400 
everything's big in Texas well this
certainly<00:00:35.340> is<00:00:35.610> and<00:00:36.360> I<00:00:36.630> think<00:00:36.690> this<00:00:36.899> is<00:00:37.079> taking

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
certainly is and I think this is taking

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.080 
certainly is and I think this is taking
it<00:00:37.500> to<00:00:37.620> another<00:00:37.649> level<00:00:38.129> but<00:00:38.610> not<00:00:38.790> doing

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
it to another level but not doing

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.330 
it to another level but not doing
concrete<00:00:39.690> and<00:00:39.870> Di's<00:00:40.440> and<00:00:40.800> trying<00:00:41.040> to<00:00:41.129> do<00:00:41.309> a

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
concrete and Di's and trying to do a

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:42.830 
concrete and Di's and trying to do a
faint<00:00:41.640> look<00:00:41.850> but<00:00:42.000> actually<00:00:42.239> making<00:00:42.690> the

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
faint look but actually making the

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.750 
faint look but actually making the
investment<00:00:43.290> buying<00:00:43.500> the<00:00:43.710> rock<00:00:43.920> and<00:00:44.190> building
