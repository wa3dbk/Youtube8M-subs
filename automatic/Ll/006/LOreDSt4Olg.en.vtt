great<00:01:20.090> addition<00:01:20.420> since<00:01:21.079> it's<00:01:21.380> feeding<00:01:21.679> the

00:01:21.819 --> 00:01:21.829 
great addition since it's feeding the

00:01:21.829 --> 00:01:24.069 
great addition since it's feeding the
butterflies<00:01:22.369> that<00:01:23.030> makes<00:01:23.270> more<00:01:23.539> and<00:01:23.600> more<00:01:23.869> for

00:01:24.069 --> 00:01:24.079

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:07.659 
zinnias just because of the old

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:09.990 
zinnias just because of the old
varieties<00:02:08.020> that<00:02:08.319> they<00:02:08.560> were<00:02:08.740> very<00:02:09.009> tall<00:02:09.429> and

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 
varieties that they were very tall and

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.540 
varieties that they were very tall and
they<00:02:10.179> probably<00:02:10.479> flop<00:02:10.869> over<00:02:11.160> try<00:02:12.160> some<00:02:12.459> of

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
they probably flop over try some of

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:15.420 
they probably flop over try some of
these<00:02:12.640> mounted<00:02:13.319> perfusion<00:02:14.319> zinnias<00:02:14.860> I<00:02:15.069> got

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
these mounted perfusion zinnias I got

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:18.809 
these mounted perfusion zinnias I got
the<00:02:15.580> orange<00:02:16.000> the<00:02:16.600> cherry<00:02:16.989> the<00:02:17.260> apricot<00:02:17.860> and

the orange the cherry the apricot and
also<00:02:19.330> I<00:02:19.630> tried<00:02:20.260> a<00:02:20.290> couple<00:02:20.650> new<00:02:20.770> varieties<00:02:21.310> this

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:21.489 
also I tried a couple new varieties this

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:32.440 
also I tried a couple new varieties this
year<00:02:21.730> too

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.510
