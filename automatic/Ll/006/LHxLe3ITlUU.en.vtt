00:02:56.979 --> 00:02:56.989 
guide and you say it's important wise

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:00.310 
guide and you say it's important wise
also<00:02:57.290> because<00:02:58.070> when<00:02:58.550> the<00:02:58.640> ball<00:02:58.850> comes<00:02:59.360> in<00:02:59.630> like

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:00.320 
also because when the ball comes in like

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:02.500 
also because when the ball comes in like
if<00:03:00.680> it's<00:03:00.980> a<00:03:01.070> fast<00:03:01.280> bowler<00:03:01.459> bowls<00:03:01.730> and<00:03:02.000> in<00:03:02.209> swing

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
if it's a fast bowler bowls and in swing

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:04.509 
if it's a fast bowler bowls and in swing
and<00:03:02.660> delivery<00:03:02.989> is<00:03:03.200> usually<00:03:03.680> hits<00:03:03.860> here<00:03:04.340> only

00:03:04.509 --> 00:03:04.519 
and delivery is usually hits here only

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:06.490 
and delivery is usually hits here only
so<00:03:04.940> it<00:03:05.030> is<00:03:05.360> very<00:03:05.540> important<00:03:05.930> so<00:03:06.140> how<00:03:06.290> would<00:03:06.350> you

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
so it is very important so how would you

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.710 
so it is very important so how would you
wear<00:03:06.769> it<00:03:06.920> exactly<00:03:07.250> just<00:03:07.459> to<00:03:07.610> show<00:03:07.910> of<00:03:08.360> yours

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:08.720 
wear it exactly just to show of yours

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:10.420 
wear it exactly just to show of yours
because<00:03:09.290> they<00:03:09.410> do<00:03:09.470> not<00:03:09.650> know<00:03:09.860> what's<00:03:10.070> an<00:03:10.220> inner

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:10.430 
because they do not know what's an inner

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:17.560 
because they do not know what's an inner
thigh<00:03:10.610> got<00:03:10.790> it<00:03:10.940> wrong

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:17.570 

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:20.180 

so<00:03:18.570> it's<00:03:18.780> a<00:03:18.900> part<00:03:19.200> of<00:03:19.440> it<00:03:19.680> or<00:03:19.800> you<00:03:19.830> have<00:03:20.010> time

and the open wonder universe to how they

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:40.600 
and the open wonder universe to how they
managed<00:05:38.960> to<00:05:39.110> walk<00:05:39.320> around<00:05:39.560> I<00:05:40.010> mean<00:05:40.370> on<00:05:40.520> the

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:40.610 
managed to walk around I mean on the

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:42.070 
managed to walk around I mean on the
ground<00:05:40.850> that's<00:05:41.000> one<00:05:41.270> thing<00:05:41.510> but<00:05:41.540> you<00:05:41.810> know<00:05:41.840> we

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:42.080 
ground that's one thing but you know we

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:43.510 
ground that's one thing but you know we
are<00:05:42.140> normally<00:05:42.470> used<00:05:42.680> to<00:05:42.830> seeing<00:05:42.920> the<00:05:43.220> normal

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:43.520 
are normally used to seeing the normal

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:45.100 
are normally used to seeing the normal
sports<00:05:43.760> shoes<00:05:44.030> yeah<00:05:44.270> or<00:05:44.480> the<00:05:44.630> rubber<00:05:44.750> spikes

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:45.110 
sports shoes yeah or the rubber spikes

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:47.070 
sports shoes yeah or the rubber spikes
but<00:05:45.320> you<00:05:45.500> have<00:05:45.710> a<00:05:45.740> combination<00:05:46.010> I<00:05:46.520> guess

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:47.080 
but you have a combination I guess

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:50.860 
but you have a combination I guess
because<00:05:48.080> a<00:05:48.200> batsman<00:05:48.880> usually<00:05:49.880> wears<00:05:50.120> a<00:05:50.480> half

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:50.870 
because a batsman usually wears a half

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:54.820 
because a batsman usually wears a half
spikes<00:05:51.200> only<00:05:51.470> so<00:05:52.210> because<00:05:53.320> this<00:05:54.320> thing<00:05:54.560> you

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:54.830 
spikes only so because this thing you

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:57.100 
spikes only so because this thing you
know<00:05:54.920> controls<00:05:55.310> and<00:05:55.610> it<00:05:56.000> didn't<00:05:56.300> skates<00:05:56.570> so

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:57.110 
know controls and it didn't skates so

00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:59.530 
know controls and it didn't skates so
spikes<00:05:57.620> are<00:05:57.800> very<00:05:57.920> crucial<00:05:58.460> for<00:05:58.640> a<00:05:59.060> bad<00:05:59.270> son<00:05:59.450> or

00:05:59.530 --> 00:05:59.540 
spikes are very crucial for a bad son or

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:01.990 
spikes are very crucial for a bad son or
a<00:05:59.600> failure<00:05:59.810> of<00:05:59.930> anyone<00:06:00.470> more<00:06:00.860> does<00:06:01.640> this<00:06:01.790> come

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:02.000 
a failure of anyone more does this come

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.320 
a failure of anyone more does this come
out<00:06:02.120> the<00:06:02.600> ayah<00:06:02.720> it<00:06:03.260> can<00:06:03.470> and<00:06:03.920> what<00:06:04.670> about<00:06:04.910> the

out the ayah it can and what about the

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:08.610 
out the ayah it can and what about the
rubber<00:06:05.690> ones<00:06:05.900> who<00:06:06.440> uses<00:06:06.650> the<00:06:06.920> rubber<00:06:07.220> spikes<00:06:07.460> a

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:08.620 
rubber ones who uses the rubber spikes a

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:11.500 
rubber ones who uses the rubber spikes a
batsman<00:06:09.620> uses<00:06:10.100> the<00:06:10.190> hospice<00:06:10.550> you<00:06:10.670> know<00:06:10.760> like

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:11.510 
batsman uses the hospice you know like

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:13.480 
batsman uses the hospice you know like
this<00:06:12.290> half<00:06:12.500> should<00:06:12.710> be<00:06:12.740> rubbers<00:06:13.130> and<00:06:13.280> this

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:13.490 
this half should be rubbers and this

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:16.060 
this half should be rubbers and this
half<00:06:13.640> should<00:06:13.820> be<00:06:13.970> spikes<00:06:14.630> so<00:06:15.410> they<00:06:15.800> can<00:06:15.950> get

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:16.070 
half should be spikes so they can get

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:18.610 
half should be spikes so they can get
better<00:06:16.280> grip<00:06:16.640> because<00:06:17.120> when<00:06:17.660> it<00:06:17.780> is<00:06:17.900> full<00:06:18.260> of

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:18.620 
better grip because when it is full of

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:21.040 
better grip because when it is full of
spikes<00:06:18.920> so<00:06:19.130> they<00:06:19.490> can<00:06:19.640> still<00:06:20.150> get<00:06:20.840> a<00:06:20.870> little

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:21.050 
spikes so they can still get a little

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:23.740 
spikes so they can still get a little
bit<00:06:21.290> slippery<00:06:21.610> okay<00:06:22.610> and<00:06:23.150> what<00:06:23.480> about<00:06:23.510> the

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:23.750 
bit slippery okay and what about the

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:26.410

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:26.420 
past fastball they use full spikes

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:28.240 
past fastball they use full spikes
because<00:06:26.630> yeah<00:06:27.230> because<00:06:27.470> they<00:06:27.740> need<00:06:28.010> better
