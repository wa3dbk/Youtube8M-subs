00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:26.500 
on how do we put it on a stick

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.679 
on how do we put it on a stick
everything<00:00:26.890> famous<00:00:27.279> comes<00:00:27.490> on<00:00:27.640> a<00:00:27.670> stick<00:00:27.940> so<00:00:28.240> we

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:28.689 
everything famous comes on a stick so we

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:30.359 
everything famous comes on a stick so we
said<00:00:28.869> let's<00:00:28.990> put<00:00:29.170> a<00:00:29.230> potato<00:00:29.590> on<00:00:29.710> a<00:00:29.800> stick<00:00:30.100> and

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:30.369 
said let's put a potato on a stick and

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:32.549 
said let's put a potato on a stick and
the<00:00:30.520> best<00:00:30.699> way<00:00:30.850> to<00:00:30.880> do<00:00:31.150> that<00:00:31.359> was<00:00:32.050> to<00:00:32.079> have<00:00:32.379> a

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:32.559 
the best way to do that was to have a

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:35.220 
the best way to do that was to have a
chip<00:00:32.800> on<00:00:32.920> a<00:00:32.980> stick<00:00:33.280> so<00:00:34.180> we<00:00:34.329> formulated<00:00:35.020> this

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:35.230 
chip on a stick so we formulated this

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:39.299 
chip on a stick so we formulated this
idea<00:00:35.620> of<00:00:35.770> how<00:00:35.920> do<00:00:35.980> we<00:00:37.320> put<00:00:38.320> one<00:00:38.500> old<00:00:38.649> potato<00:00:39.010> I

00:00:39.299 --> 00:00:39.309 
idea of how do we put one old potato I

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:40.590 
idea of how do we put one old potato I
said<00:00:39.489> if<00:00:39.550> you<00:00:39.610> put<00:00:39.730> a<00:00:39.760> whole<00:00:39.850> potato<00:00:40.059> is<00:00:40.420> gonna

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:40.600 
said if you put a whole potato is gonna

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.959 
said if you put a whole potato is gonna
one<00:00:41.290> cook<00:00:41.530> so<00:00:42.160> we<00:00:42.250> said<00:00:42.399> let's<00:00:42.550> make<00:00:42.670> it<00:00:42.730> into<00:00:42.940> a

00:00:42.959 --> 00:00:42.969 
one cook so we said let's make it into a

00:00:42.969 --> 00:00:45.330 
one cook so we said let's make it into a
spiral<00:00:43.480> type<00:00:43.719> thing<00:00:43.960> and<00:00:44.200> that's<00:00:44.980> when<00:00:45.219> the

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:45.340 
spiral type thing and that's when the

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:46.709 
spiral type thing and that's when the
whole<00:00:45.370> concept<00:00:45.910> of<00:00:45.969> chip<00:00:46.180> on<00:00:46.300> a<00:00:46.329> stick<00:00:46.570> was

00:00:46.709 --> 00:00:46.719 
whole concept of chip on a stick was

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:48.240 
whole concept of chip on a stick was
born<00:00:46.930> do<00:00:47.559> you<00:00:47.620> think<00:00:47.829> you'll<00:00:47.920> be<00:00:48.010> able<00:00:48.070> to

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:16.240 
and then when it is very Livi that stops

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.440 
and then when it is very Livi that stops
there<00:01:16.750> you<00:01:16.930> go<00:01:17.080> the<00:01:17.470> potato<00:01:17.800> comes<00:01:18.070> out<00:01:18.450> you

they've started now after we started
doing<00:01:48.880> the<00:01:49.030> chip<00:01:49.210> on<00:01:49.300> a<00:01:49.360> stick<00:01:49.600> a<00:01:49.660> lot<00:01:49.780> of

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:49.900 
doing the chip on a stick a lot of

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:51.090 
doing the chip on a stick a lot of
people<00:01:50.170> have<00:01:50.260> started<00:01:50.320> doing<00:01:50.590> it<00:01:50.800> because
