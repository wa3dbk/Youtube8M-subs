00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
happens is that the nerve can heal

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.420 
happens is that the nerve can heal

these<00:00:49.379> patients<00:00:49.710> it's<00:00:50.160> not<00:00:50.329> important<00:00:51.329> to<00:00:51.719> get

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
these patients it's not important to get

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.959 
these patients it's not important to get
more<00:00:52.230> strength<00:00:52.620> in<00:00:52.860> the<00:00:52.949> facial<00:00:53.160> muscles<00:00:53.699> what

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
more strength in the facial muscles what

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.760 
more strength in the facial muscles what
we<00:00:54.090> really<00:00:54.449> need<00:00:54.660> to<00:00:54.870> get<00:00:55.079> is<00:00:55.350> more

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
we really need to get is more

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.569 
we really need to get is more
coordination<00:00:57.140> because<00:00:58.140> if<00:00:58.440> the<00:00:58.770> wrong<00:00:59.010> muscle

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
coordination because if the wrong muscle

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.900 
coordination because if the wrong muscle
is<00:00:59.760> flexing<00:01:00.539> out<00:01:00.809> of<00:01:01.020> sequence<00:01:01.440> it<00:01:02.129> causes<00:01:02.879> a

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
is flexing out of sequence it causes a

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.329 
is flexing out of sequence it causes a
distortion<00:01:03.570> of<00:01:04.049> the<00:01:04.350> facial<00:01:04.799> movement<00:01:05.220> that

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
distortion of the facial movement that

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.399 
distortion of the facial movement that
can<00:01:05.489> look<00:01:05.700> something<00:01:06.090> like<00:01:06.119> this<00:01:06.540> now<00:01:07.020> this<00:01:07.200> is

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
can look something like this now this is

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.530 
can look something like this now this is
not<00:01:07.619> a<00:01:07.650> lack<00:01:07.979> of<00:01:08.010> movement<00:01:08.369> this<00:01:09.000> is<00:01:09.210> wrong

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
not a lack of movement this is wrong

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.170 
not a lack of movement this is wrong
movement<00:01:09.930> a<00:01:10.320> big<00:01:10.710> part<00:01:11.070> of<00:01:11.220> the<00:01:11.340> retraining<00:01:11.790> at

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
movement a big part of the retraining at

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.270 
movement a big part of the retraining at
that<00:01:12.390> point<00:01:12.750> is<00:01:12.990> teaching<00:01:13.560> people<00:01:13.770> what

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
that point is teaching people what

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.450 
that point is teaching people what
muscles<00:01:14.760> are<00:01:14.850> actually<00:01:15.590> needed<00:01:16.590> to<00:01:16.950> use<00:01:17.130> what

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
muscles are actually needed to use what

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.910 
muscles are actually needed to use what
parts<00:01:17.790> of<00:01:17.939> the<00:01:18.060> face<00:01:18.320> for<00:01:19.320> example<00:01:19.409> we<00:01:19.890> think

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
parts of the face for example we think

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.249 
parts of the face for example we think
we<00:01:20.250> smile<00:01:20.549> with<00:01:20.729> our<00:01:20.880> mouths<00:01:21.060> but<00:01:21.390> we<00:01:21.960> don't

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
we smile with our mouths but we don't

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.280 
we smile with our mouths but we don't
the<00:01:22.770> actual<00:01:23.250> muscles<00:01:23.670> that<00:01:24.180> activate<00:01:25.140> the

the actual muscles that activate the

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.190 
the actual muscles that activate the
smile<00:01:25.590> are<00:01:25.860> located<00:01:26.460> in<00:01:26.580> the<00:01:26.700> cheek<00:01:26.970> we<00:01:27.840> smile

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
smile are located in the cheek we smile

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.499 
smile are located in the cheek we smile
with<00:01:28.500> our<00:01:28.650> cheeks<00:01:29.009> and<00:01:29.340> the<00:01:29.880> corner<00:01:30.299> of<00:01:30.329> the

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
with our cheeks and the corner of the

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.980

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
teaching patience which muscles are used

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.039 
teaching patience which muscles are used
to<00:01:37.680> move<00:01:37.920> which<00:01:38.310> structures<00:01:38.970> enables<00:01:39.840> their

teaches<00:01:47.070> people<00:01:47.310> how<00:01:47.520> to<00:01:47.960> isolate<00:01:48.960> those

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
teaches people how to isolate those

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.840 
teaches people how to isolate those
muscles<00:01:49.590> so<00:01:49.890> they're<00:01:50.070> only<00:01:50.280> using<00:01:50.579> the

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
muscles so they're only using the

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.710 
muscles so they're only using the
correct<00:01:51.240> muscle<00:01:51.810> and<00:01:52.159> teaching<00:01:53.159> them<00:01:53.310> how<00:01:53.340> to

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:53.720 
correct muscle and teaching them how to

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:58.399 
correct muscle and teaching them how to
inhibit<00:01:54.720> or<00:01:55.110> suppress<00:01:55.740> or<00:01:56.100> to<00:01:56.280> relax<00:01:57.409> the

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
inhibit or suppress or to relax the

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.499 
inhibit or suppress or to relax the
muscles<00:01:58.439> that<00:01:59.189> are<00:01:59.369> not<00:01:59.670> supposed<00:02:00.180> to<00:02:00.329> be

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
muscles that are not supposed to be

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.709 
muscles that are not supposed to be
moving<00:02:00.780> in<00:02:01.140> that<00:02:01.680> expression<00:02:02.149> so<00:02:03.149> we<00:02:03.180> create<00:02:03.689> a

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
moving in that expression so we create a

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:08.419 
moving in that expression so we create a
much<00:02:04.140> more<00:02:05.750> unified<00:02:06.920> symmetrical<00:02:07.920> facial

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
much more unified symmetrical facial

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.000 
much more unified symmetrical facial
expression
