00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:23.550
 good today I want to introduce a video 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:27.060
 that we are going to see in gratitude to 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:30.450
 Greece the video is done by teachers 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:32.669
 of the University of Murcia before the 

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:35.970
 threat that the faculty of 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.590
 ancient philology that was functioning 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:39.270
 the university and they told you not to 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.449
 can close because we talk a lot more 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:46.350
 Greek of what we believe and do all 

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:48.750
 a very interesting look at what 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.449
 the contribution so great that are the roots 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.460
 Greek in Spanish and they do 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:56.370
 students and teachers do it is 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:59.250
 a pretty informal video but pretty 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:02.339
 illustrative then on the one hand is 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.650
 that clear and real gratitude that all 

00:01:02.339 --> 00:01:06.720
 our language and all I speak on the 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.900
 language that we speak has to the 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:12.570
 Greek and that is very beautiful from part of 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.549
 these teachers and these students and 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:18.180
 on the other side given the current 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:19.659
 juncture of the Greek crisis there is a 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.539
 topic that 

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:25.810
 that is sad and it is terrible it turns out that 

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:29.079
 Europeans when they invent their idea of 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:31.509
 civilization and sell it as the idea of 

00:01:29.079 --> 00:01:33.969
 the civilization more complete than them 

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:36.850
 have conceived and impose that model 

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:39.929
 about the world what is it 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:42.549
 even behind colonialism they 

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:45.310
 consider that the parent or one of the 

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:48.219
 most important matrices of all the 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:49.990
 European civilization is Greek because of 

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:51.360
 there is effectively how 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:53.590
 the land was named until 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.599
 psychoanalysis through the language 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:58.149
 same for philosophy many of the 

00:01:55.599 --> 00:02:00.159
 things that we will see in the video that gives us 

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:02.259
 that at the time when greece is 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:06.459
 facing such an economic situation 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:08.579
 alggida and his life as a country goes through 

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:12.549
 all the dangers that are going through 

00:02:08.579 --> 00:02:15.640
 all that legacy that they feel so 

00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:18.340
 proud all that legacy that replicate 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:20.410
 in all forms of the academy all 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:23.440
 that legacy that is in the architecture 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:25.150
 of all European countries all that 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.630
 even in the white house all that 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:30.080
 legacy 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:33.710
 I know when subjected to a 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:35.540
 country to the most outrageous conditions and 

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:38.510
 terrible as what is happening in 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:40.160
 Greece has long been rumored that the 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:42.770
 issue of debt repayment and no longer 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:45.800
 It is not economic but political 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:48.320
 there is an idea to punish greece how 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:50.990
 is going to punish a people that has 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:54.020
 contributed with his thought all the 

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:56.780
 baggage of civilization to Europeans and 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:59.120
 through Europeans to the world this 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:01.370
 video is a recognition a 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:04.880
 intellectual historical recognition 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:06.920
 philosophical politician to the great culture and 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:09.410
 to the great Greek people that's why 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:12.310
 Today we want to share the page 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:12.310
 the house of history
