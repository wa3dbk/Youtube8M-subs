conditioned it like normal and the only

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.710 
conditioned it like normal and the only
thing<00:01:41.460> is<00:01:41.579> you<00:01:41.700> have<00:01:41.729> to<00:01:42.030> make<00:01:42.210> sure<00:01:42.390> you<00:01:42.509> use

I've been using the redkin color
magnetics<00:01:48.240> extent<00:01:48.840> I<00:01:48.960> think<00:01:49.200> it<00:01:49.290> is<00:01:49.409> it's<00:01:49.619> the

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
magnetics extent I think it is it's the

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.620 
magnetics extent I think it is it's the
Redken<00:01:50.189> shampoo<00:01:50.640> conditioner<00:01:51.180> in<00:01:51.299> the<00:01:51.390> pink

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
Redken shampoo conditioner in the pink

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.899 
Redken shampoo conditioner in the pink
bottle<00:01:52.020> I've<00:01:52.530> been<00:01:52.710> using<00:01:52.920> that<00:01:53.100> on<00:01:53.460> my<00:01:53.670> hair

bottle I've been using that on my hair

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.569 
bottle I've been using that on my hair
because<00:01:54.290> you<00:01:55.290> need<00:01:55.439> to<00:01:55.530> use<00:01:55.680> sulfate<00:01:56.100> free<00:01:56.369> so

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
because you need to use sulfate free so

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.910 
because you need to use sulfate free so
it<00:01:56.729> doesn't<00:01:57.030> loosen<00:01:57.360> the<00:01:57.509> tape<00:01:57.750> but<00:01:58.380> I've<00:01:58.680> just

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:32.280 
easy to take care of and I mean they've

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:34.580
