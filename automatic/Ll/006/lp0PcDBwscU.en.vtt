00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:09.169 

this<00:00:07.140> work<00:00:07.350> can<00:00:07.379> be<00:00:07.680> challenging<00:00:08.370> and<00:00:08.880> I'm

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179 
this work can be challenging and I'm

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:11.000 
this work can be challenging and I'm
always<00:00:09.450> looking<00:00:09.690> for<00:00:09.870> ways<00:00:10.200> to<00:00:10.230> make<00:00:10.590> it<00:00:10.769> less

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
always looking for ways to make it less

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.520 
always looking for ways to make it less
challenging<00:00:11.730> so<00:00:12.420> I'm<00:00:12.540> always<00:00:12.780> thinking<00:00:13.139> of

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
challenging so I'm always thinking of

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.129 
challenging so I'm always thinking of
procedures<00:00:14.219> concepts<00:00:15.120> and<00:00:15.420> techniques<00:00:15.929> that

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
procedures concepts and techniques that

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.650 
procedures concepts and techniques that
will<00:00:16.440> help<00:00:16.470> me<00:00:16.920> when<00:00:17.130> I'm<00:00:17.250> at<00:00:17.400> the<00:00:17.580> bench<00:00:17.850> and<00:00:18.180> I

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
will help me when I'm at the bench and I

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.420 
will help me when I'm at the bench and I
rely<00:00:19.080> on<00:00:19.109> those<00:00:19.470> to<00:00:19.710> help<00:00:19.890> me<00:00:20.010> work<00:00:20.160> more

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
rely on those to help me work more

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.599 
rely on those to help me work more
efficiently<00:00:20.970> more<00:00:21.750> accurately<00:00:22.380> and<00:00:22.800> get<00:00:23.460> to

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
efficiently more accurately and get to

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.250 
efficiently more accurately and get to
the<00:00:23.730> truth<00:00:23.970> of<00:00:24.150> the<00:00:24.240> problem<00:00:24.630> as<00:00:24.720> quickly<00:00:24.779> as

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
the truth of the problem as quickly as

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.980 
the truth of the problem as quickly as
possible<00:00:25.640> so<00:00:26.640> I've<00:00:26.760> got<00:00:26.939> an<00:00:27.090> idea<00:00:27.390> how<00:00:27.660> to<00:00:27.689> help

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
possible so I've got an idea how to help

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.410 
possible so I've got an idea how to help
with<00:00:28.140> flute<00:00:28.619> padding<00:00:29.130> and<00:00:29.310> it's<00:00:29.760> very<00:00:29.939> simple

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
with flute padding and it's very simple

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.930 
with flute padding and it's very simple
let<00:00:30.750> me<00:00:30.840> show<00:00:31.050> you<00:00:31.140> when<00:00:32.099> checking<00:00:32.430> the<00:00:32.700> pads

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
let me show you when checking the pads

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.790 
let me show you when checking the pads
for<00:00:33.090> coverage<00:00:33.600> on<00:00:33.780> the<00:00:33.930> flute<00:00:34.170> whether<00:00:34.559> you're

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
for coverage on the flute whether you're

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.310 
for coverage on the flute whether you're
using<00:00:34.980> a<00:00:35.309> leak<00:00:35.520> light<00:00:35.790> or<00:00:36.059> feeler<00:00:36.660> gauge<00:00:36.960> I

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
using a leak light or feeler gauge I

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.709 
using a leak light or feeler gauge I
find<00:00:38.010> it's<00:00:38.160> really<00:00:38.520> helpful<00:00:38.850> to<00:00:39.180> mark<00:00:39.480> the

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
find it's really helpful to mark the

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.130 
find it's really helpful to mark the
leaks<00:00:40.140> right<00:00:40.680> on<00:00:40.920> the<00:00:41.040> key<00:00:41.309> and<00:00:41.750> I<00:00:42.750> do<00:00:42.809> this

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
leaks right on the key and I do this

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.920 
leaks right on the key and I do this
with<00:00:43.200> my<00:00:43.559> Sharpie<00:00:43.980> pen<00:00:44.280> so<00:00:45.030> I<00:00:45.059> found<00:00:45.390> a<00:00:45.480> link<00:00:45.690> in

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
with my Sharpie pen so I found a link in

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.139 
with my Sharpie pen so I found a link in
this<00:00:46.079> area<00:00:46.469> here<00:00:46.800> and<00:00:47.190> I'm<00:00:47.370> marking<00:00:47.730> outside

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
this area here and I'm marking outside

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.840 
this area here and I'm marking outside
boundaries<00:00:48.930> of<00:00:49.140> where<00:00:49.320> that<00:00:49.500> leak<00:00:49.739> occurs<00:00:50.129> now

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
boundaries of where that leak occurs now

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.850 
boundaries of where that leak occurs now
some<00:00:51.120> people<00:00:51.420> do<00:00:51.600> this<00:00:51.809> on<00:00:52.050> a<00:00:52.079> piece<00:00:52.500> of<00:00:52.530> paper

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
some people do this on a piece of paper

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.850 
some people do this on a piece of paper
but<00:00:53.760> I<00:00:53.789> find<00:00:54.180> it's<00:00:54.360> less<00:00:54.629> confusing<00:00:55.199> to<00:00:55.710> have

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
but I find it's less confusing to have

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.680 
but I find it's less confusing to have
this<00:00:56.100> written<00:00:56.340> directly<00:00:56.760> on<00:00:56.969> the<00:00:57.120> key<00:00:57.329> there's

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
this written directly on the key there's

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.540 
this written directly on the key there's
no<00:00:57.840> confusion<00:00:58.079> later<00:00:58.590> where<00:00:58.920> that<00:00:59.100> leak<00:00:59.280> is

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
no confusion later where that leak is

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.880 
no confusion later where that leak is
I'll<00:01:00.090> even<00:01:00.329> go<00:01:00.510> a<00:01:00.539> step<00:01:00.629> further<00:01:01.140> and<00:01:01.500> if<00:01:01.770> I

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
I'll even go a step further and if I

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.609 
I'll even go a step further and if I
have<00:01:02.070> a<00:01:02.100> sense<00:01:02.460> of<00:01:02.730> how<00:01:03.030> deep<00:01:03.690> that<00:01:03.719> leak<00:01:04.320> is

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
have a sense of how deep that leak is

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.910 
have a sense of how deep that leak is
I'll<00:01:05.100> write<00:01:05.159> the<00:01:05.549> number<00:01:05.970> on<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:06.780> area<00:01:07.200> so<00:01:07.619> in

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
I'll write the number on the area so in

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.440 
I'll write the number on the area so in
this<00:01:08.040> case<00:01:08.280> I've<00:01:08.549> written<00:01:08.729> a<00:01:08.880> number<00:01:09.030> 3

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
this case I've written a number 3

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.090 
this case I've written a number 3
indicating<00:01:10.110> I'm<00:01:10.229> going<00:01:10.500> to<00:01:10.560> put<00:01:10.740> a<00:01:10.770> three

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
indicating I'm going to put a three

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.370 
indicating I'm going to put a three
thousandth<00:01:11.729> of<00:01:11.850> an<00:01:12.000> inch<00:01:12.119> thick<00:01:12.510> shim<00:01:12.930> in<00:01:13.170> that

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
thousandth of an inch thick shim in that

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.340 
thousandth of an inch thick shim in that
area<00:01:13.710> I<00:01:13.950> could<00:01:14.520> go<00:01:14.820> on<00:01:14.850> and<00:01:15.330> mark<00:01:15.540> all<00:01:15.840> my<00:01:16.049> pads

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
area I could go on and mark all my pads

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.200 
area I could go on and mark all my pads
for<00:01:16.680> that<00:01:16.830> matter<00:01:17.130> I<00:01:17.430> might<00:01:17.729> have<00:01:17.880> found<00:01:18.030> a

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
for that matter I might have found a

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.390 
for that matter I might have found a
leak<00:01:18.390> here<00:01:18.810> and<00:01:19.020> here<00:01:19.530> maybe<00:01:19.830> this<00:01:20.130> was<00:01:20.369> a

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
leak here and here maybe this was a

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.440 
leak here and here maybe this was a
1,000<00:01:21.360> sleek<00:01:21.659> this<00:01:22.140> is<00:01:22.200> a<00:01:22.380> 2,000<00:01:23.280> over<00:01:24.119> here<00:01:24.420> I

is not in any way going to be left on
the<00:01:34.829> instrument<00:01:35.340> when<00:01:35.549> you<00:01:35.640> hand<00:01:35.820> it<00:01:35.909> back<00:01:36.030> to

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
the client now that I've got my leaks

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.109 
the client now that I've got my leaks
marked<00:01:39.600> on<00:01:39.780> the<00:01:39.930> key<00:01:40.110> cups<00:01:40.409> I'm<00:01:40.650> ready<00:01:40.860> to

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:41.119 
marked on the key cups I'm ready to

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:43.760 
marked on the key cups I'm ready to
disassemble<00:01:42.119> the<00:01:42.180> instrument<00:01:42.869> and<00:01:43.140> put<00:01:43.649> my

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
disassemble the instrument and put my

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.460 
disassemble the instrument and put my
partial<00:01:44.070> shims<00:01:44.490> in<00:01:44.729> where<00:01:44.970> needed

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:45.470 
partial shims in where needed

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:50.260 
partial shims in where needed
I<00:01:47.950> think<00:01:48.950> I'll<00:01:49.070> just<00:01:49.190> pull<00:01:49.430> off<00:01:49.610> the<00:01:49.640> c-sharp

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:50.270 
I think I'll just pull off the c-sharp

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:52.480 
I think I'll just pull off the c-sharp
and<00:01:50.450> attend<00:01:50.810> to<00:01:50.900> that<00:01:51.050> pad<00:01:51.410> right<00:01:51.680> now<00:01:51.890> with

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490 
and attend to that pad right now with

I'll<00:01:57.830> take<00:01:58.070> my<00:01:58.520> sharpie<00:01:59.060> once<00:01:59.240> again<00:01:59.600> and

00:01:59.860 --> 00:01:59.870 
I'll take my sharpie once again and

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:03.040 
I'll take my sharpie once again and
continue<00:02:00.800> those<00:02:00.980> marks<00:02:01.430> down<00:02:01.700> the<00:02:01.970> side<00:02:02.270> of

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
this is a permanent mark so make it

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.950 
this is a permanent mark so make it
small<00:02:50.110> and<00:02:50.140> it'll<00:02:50.800> be<00:02:50.980> mostly<00:02:51.670> invisible<00:02:52.000> now

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:52.960 
small and it'll be mostly invisible now

let's<00:02:53.260> take<00:02:53.500> the<00:02:53.710> pad<00:02:53.950> out<00:02:54.280> oh<00:02:54.640> you<00:02:55.450> can<00:02:55.780> see

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:55.990 
let's take the pad out oh you can see

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:57.690 
let's take the pad out oh you can see
that<00:02:56.200> there's<00:02:56.440> already<00:02:56.620> a<00:02:56.890> mark<00:02:57.190> at<00:02:57.340> the<00:02:57.460> 12

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
that there's already a mark at the 12

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:01.050 
that there's already a mark at the 12
o'clock<00:02:57.820> point<00:02:58.560> under<00:02:59.560> under<00:03:00.160> the<00:03:00.190> washer<00:03:00.850> I

o'clock point under under the washer I

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:02.940 
o'clock point under under the washer I
prefer<00:03:01.750> to<00:03:01.840> put<00:03:01.990> it<00:03:02.140> at<00:03:02.230> the<00:03:02.380> edge<00:03:02.560> and<00:03:02.860> I'll

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950 
prefer to put it at the edge and I'll

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:05.370 
prefer to put it at the edge and I'll
explain<00:03:03.400> why<00:03:03.670> if<00:03:04.120> that<00:03:04.180> pad<00:03:04.600> moves<00:03:04.990> slightly

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:05.380 
explain why if that pad moves slightly

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:07.770 
explain why if that pad moves slightly
the<00:03:06.190> market<00:03:06.610> the<00:03:06.700> center<00:03:07.030> still<00:03:07.300> looks<00:03:07.540> more

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
the market the center still looks more

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:09.810 
the market the center still looks more
or<00:03:07.810> less<00:03:07.900> at<00:03:08.200> the<00:03:08.230> 12<00:03:08.560> o'clock<00:03:08.680> point<00:03:09.310> but

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:09.820 
or less at the 12 o'clock point but

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:11.490 
or less at the 12 o'clock point but
towards<00:03:10.090> the<00:03:10.150> edge<00:03:10.330> it's<00:03:10.630> moved<00:03:10.900> quite<00:03:11.140> a<00:03:11.170> bit

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500 
towards the edge it's moved quite a bit

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.890 
towards the edge it's moved quite a bit
that<00:03:12.250> little<00:03:12.580> bit<00:03:12.790> will<00:03:12.940> make<00:03:13.210> quite<00:03:13.840> a

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
that little bit will make quite a

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:14.970 
that little bit will make quite a
difference<00:03:14.020> when<00:03:14.560> we're<00:03:14.710> dealing<00:03:14.800> with

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:14.980 
difference when we're dealing with

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:16.620 
difference when we're dealing with
partial<00:03:15.490> shims<00:03:15.760> and<00:03:15.970> we're<00:03:16.150> getting<00:03:16.420> very

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:16.630 
partial shims and we're getting very

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:19.260 
partial shims and we're getting very
exacting<00:03:17.290> moving<00:03:18.160> it<00:03:18.280> back<00:03:18.520> into<00:03:18.880> home

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:19.270 
exacting moving it back into home

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:22.200 
exacting moving it back into home
position<00:03:19.950> let's<00:03:20.950> put<00:03:21.220> a<00:03:21.250> needle<00:03:21.610> in<00:03:21.790> the<00:03:21.940> pad

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:22.210 
position let's put a needle in the pad

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:25.620 
position let's put a needle in the pad
and<00:03:22.840> pull<00:03:23.110> the<00:03:23.230> pad<00:03:23.470> out<00:03:23.760> very<00:03:24.760> good<00:03:25.120> you<00:03:25.450> could

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:25.630 
and pull the pad out very good you could

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:28.740 
and pull the pad out very good you could
see<00:03:25.840> that<00:03:26.020> there's<00:03:26.260> a<00:03:26.320> mark<00:03:26.730> locating<00:03:27.730> the<00:03:28.030> 12

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.750 
see that there's a mark locating the 12

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:31.410 
see that there's a mark locating the 12
o'clock<00:03:29.020> position<00:03:29.140> of<00:03:30.010> the<00:03:30.610> shim<00:03:30.910> under<00:03:31.300> the

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:31.420 
o'clock position of the shim under the

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:35.070 
o'clock position of the shim under the
pad<00:03:31.660> and<00:03:32.110> we<00:03:32.920> mark<00:03:33.220> the<00:03:33.490> full<00:03:33.970> shim<00:03:34.330> that's

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:35.080 
pad and we mark the full shim that's

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:37.530 
pad and we mark the full shim that's
closest<00:03:35.680> to<00:03:35.770> the<00:03:35.860> pad<00:03:36.220> and<00:03:36.550> oftentimes

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:37.540 
closest to the pad and oftentimes

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.480 
closest to the pad and oftentimes
there's<00:03:37.990> several<00:03:38.230> full<00:03:38.590> shims<00:03:38.920> there<00:03:39.280> maybe

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:39.490 
there's several full shims there maybe

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:42.360 
there's several full shims there maybe
in<00:03:39.760> this<00:03:39.910> case<00:03:40.210> let's<00:03:40.840> see<00:03:41.080> yeah<00:03:42.040> there's<00:03:42.310> a

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:42.370 
in this case let's see yeah there's a

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:43.890 
in this case let's see yeah there's a
couple<00:03:42.550> there<00:03:42.940> but<00:03:43.210> they're<00:03:43.360> actually<00:03:43.540> glued

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:43.900 
couple there but they're actually glued

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:46.140 
couple there but they're actually glued
together<00:03:44.400> partial<00:03:45.400> shim<00:03:45.550> that's<00:03:45.760> glued<00:03:45.970> on

located

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:07.490 
located

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:09.970 
located
right<00:04:07.580> where<00:04:07.760> we<00:04:07.850> wanted<00:04:08.260> I'll<00:04:09.260> just<00:04:09.500> take<00:04:09.770> a

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:09.980 
right where we wanted I'll just take a

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:13.810 
right where we wanted I'll just take a
little<00:04:10.190> drop<00:04:10.460> of<00:04:10.490> shellac<00:04:11.620> put<00:04:12.620> it<00:04:12.710> on<00:04:12.890> the

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:19.160 
full shim in position as I'm

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:21.670 
full shim in position as I'm
manipulating<00:04:20.150> the<00:04:20.300> partial<00:04:20.870> into<00:04:21.200> position

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:21.680 
manipulating the partial into position

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:24.730 
manipulating the partial into position
I'll<00:04:21.800> just<00:04:22.070> hold<00:04:22.250> it<00:04:22.430> for<00:04:22.640> just<00:04:22.670> a<00:04:22.910> moment<00:04:23.740> and

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:24.740 
I'll just hold it for just a moment and

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:28.500 
I'll just hold it for just a moment and
then<00:04:25.460> reset<00:04:25.940> my<00:04:26.090> pad

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:28.510 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:30.550 

now<00:04:29.510> I<00:04:29.540> could<00:04:29.840> put<00:04:29.960> it<00:04:30.080> back<00:04:30.230> on<00:04:30.440> the

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:30.560 
now I could put it back on the

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:33.850 
now I could put it back on the
instrument<00:04:30.950> and<00:04:31.070> check<00:04:31.310> it<00:04:31.490> for<00:04:31.640> coverage
