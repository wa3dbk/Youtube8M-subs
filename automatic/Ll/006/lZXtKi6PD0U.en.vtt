00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:15.149 
here I guess it's because it's simple
clean<00:03:12.040> design<00:03:12.549> and<00:03:12.849> cheap<00:03:13.689> it's<00:03:14.290> under<00:03:14.560> $10

00:03:15.149 --> 00:03:15.159 
clean design and cheap it's under $10

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:18.000 
clean design and cheap it's under $10
and<00:03:15.760> the<00:03:16.470> provides<00:03:17.470> a<00:03:17.620> pretty<00:03:17.829> good

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
and the provides a pretty good

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:21.869 
and the provides a pretty good
protection<00:03:18.159> raised<00:03:19.090> edge<00:03:19.480> so<00:03:20.470> we<00:03:21.400> put<00:03:21.670> on<00:03:21.760> the

00:03:21.869 --> 00:03:21.879 
protection raised edge so we put on the

you

00:04:28.439 --> 00:04:28.449 
you

00:04:28.449 --> 00:04:33.570 
you
it's<00:04:29.250> almost<00:04:30.250> paper<00:04:30.699> thin<00:04:30.940> and<00:04:32.250> it<00:04:33.250> comes<00:04:33.490> with

it's almost paper thin and it comes with
a<00:04:33.910> back<00:04:34.330> protector<00:04:34.539> so<00:04:35.320> you<00:04:35.410> would<00:04:35.680> put<00:04:35.860> this

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:36.010 
a back protector so you would put this

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:39.659 
a back protector so you would put this
on<00:04:36.250> to<00:04:36.580> the<00:04:36.729> iPhone<00:04:37.120> and<00:04:37.479> back<00:04:38.199> before<00:04:39.070> put<00:04:39.610> it

00:04:39.659 --> 00:04:39.669 
on to the iPhone and back before put it

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:42.000 
on to the iPhone and back before put it
into<00:04:39.970> the<00:04:40.090> case<00:04:40.300> itself<00:04:40.750> and<00:04:41.050> the<00:04:41.710> reason

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:42.010 
into the case itself and the reason

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:45.240 
into the case itself and the reason
behind<00:04:42.430> that<00:04:42.760> is<00:04:42.880> on<00:04:43.840> the<00:04:44.229> iPhone<00:04:44.320> 4<00:04:44.800> I've<00:04:44.949> seen

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:45.250 
behind that is on the iPhone 4 I've seen

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:47.159 
behind that is on the iPhone 4 I've seen
it<00:04:45.430> where<00:04:45.610> people<00:04:46.120> put<00:04:46.449> in<00:04:46.570> their<00:04:46.720> pocket<00:04:47.139> or

00:04:47.159 --> 00:04:47.169 
it where people put in their pocket or

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:48.840 
it where people put in their pocket or
they<00:04:47.350> drop<00:04:47.590> in<00:04:47.800> st.<00:04:48.070> gets<00:04:48.310> behind<00:04:48.490> it

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:48.850 
they drop in st. gets behind it

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:51.840 
they drop in st. gets behind it
eventually<00:04:49.810> it<00:04:50.050> will<00:04:50.139> scratch<00:04:50.530> up<00:04:50.830> the<00:04:51.370> back

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:51.850 
eventually it will scratch up the back

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:56.760 
eventually it will scratch up the back
of<00:04:52.780> the<00:04:53.350> iPhone<00:04:53.500> so<00:04:54.720> put<00:04:55.720> this<00:04:55.870> on<00:04:56.110> before

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:56.770 
of the iPhone so put this on before

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:01.320 
of the iPhone so put this on before
bring<00:04:57.639> the<00:04:57.940> phone<00:04:58.150> into<00:04:58.449> the<00:04:58.539> case<00:05:00.240> like<00:05:01.240> I

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:01.330 
bring the phone into the case like I

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:04.589 
bring the phone into the case like I
said<00:05:01.570> it's<00:05:01.720> ultra<00:05:02.050> thin<00:05:02.380> so<00:05:03.090> you<00:05:04.090> put<00:05:04.389> it<00:05:04.479> on

00:05:04.589 --> 00:05:04.599 
said it's ultra thin so you put it on

00:05:04.599 --> 00:05:10.500 
said it's ultra thin so you put it on
you<00:05:04.780> hardly<00:05:05.169> have<00:05:05.979> any<00:05:06.250> extra<00:05:06.729> bulk<00:05:07.090> to<00:05:07.360> it<00:05:09.510> the

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:10.510 
you hardly have any extra bulk to it the

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:18.980 
you hardly have any extra bulk to it the
bottom<00:05:10.870> is<00:05:11.050> exposed<00:05:13.440> and<00:05:14.610> so<00:05:15.610> is<00:05:15.729> the<00:05:15.910> top<00:05:17.430> side

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:18.990 
bottom is exposed and so is the top side

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:22.260 
bottom is exposed and so is the top side
I<00:05:20.070> wouldn't<00:05:21.070> expect<00:05:21.250> much<00:05:21.760> drop<00:05:22.090> protection

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:22.270 
I wouldn't expect much drop protection

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:24.960 
I wouldn't expect much drop protection
from<00:05:22.840> this<00:05:23.110> it's<00:05:23.410> mainly<00:05:23.800> I<00:05:23.830> just<00:05:23.919> protect<00:05:24.849> it

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:24.970 
from this it's mainly I just protect it

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:29.400 
from this it's mainly I just protect it
