 Children are not breastfed 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:21.230
 no question since March can 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:25.539
 many adolescents do not suspect anything of the dangers of the new medium 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:26.949
 Internet spend 

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:30.980
 Mass media and communication platforms it is off 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:33.980
 our increasingly fast-paced people are becoming indispensable nowadays 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.420
 just today's Internet generation 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:40.129
 from childhood to the Internet as a source of information 

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:45.500
 Communication platform and entertainment medium is special 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:46.200
 endangered 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.050
 but what were they driven 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:52.710
 the info-café is a media educational institution of the station this castle 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.380
 has set itself the task of children and adolescents on the dangers 

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:57.920
 educate 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.060
 Social pedagogue Angelika Beer on deck works there since 2005 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:06.600
 she is the director of this institution 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.840
 the motto is the info-café 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.840
 We also give here a reject in virtual worlds 

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:16.140
 the main goal is media literacy to schools 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.560
 and so protect the children from the dangers 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.070
 SLA is one of its biggest dangers then Dr Melvin says 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:24.900
 aspect 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:30.040
 that's just going to spend too much time on the internet the other is that 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:33.350
 they just divulge too much private data because they just do not 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:37.920
 understand that the internet is not public space and not a private one 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.950
 and there just are not any fixed KNA standards like many dates 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.790
 may I now reveal what is good what it is bad 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:48.790
 because he himself is the first generation to deal with it 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:53.350
 and for this generation there is next to the internet cafe 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:56.320
 a series of projects that are offered 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:00.270
 on the one hand we go to the schools there offer lessons 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.990
 Thema Mediensucht SchülerVZ and we are always involved in projects 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:06.160
 school classes 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:07.140
 and who then 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.629
 to deal with any topics more closely 

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:14.399
 and Bochum this time it's the b5 bi-turbo Isenburger good schools 

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:16.290
 No 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.219
 have the corpse 

00:02:18.219 --> 00:02:21.339
 he works as an important partner 

00:02:21.339 --> 00:02:22.779
 Orally 

00:02:22.779 --> 00:02:26.090
 this so-called shrill networking community 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:30.970
 «Has been around since February 2007 and is now the most popular site of the 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:32.569
 twelve to 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:34.219
 driven a majority 

00:02:34.219 --> 00:02:36.469
 the first of May ask SchülerVZ gives 

00:02:36.469 --> 00:02:40.980
 because of some agreement that the data that the Kids Online put abused 

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:45.579
 then just a lot of Marvin online will expire because the tickling is not 

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:49.749
 be aware that doing something online again is just as intense or 

00:02:49.749 --> 00:02:54.099
 sometimes even more intense in addition to bullying now in the real or in the 

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:55.010
 open world 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.629
 most students of the 5b have been spared so far 

00:02:58.629 --> 00:03:01.629
 Under class helps to keep it that way 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:08.279
 Nahles ground well because one and there front Sions Sio decorated behavior 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:11.959
 do not want us from the federal government 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:13.689
 because of the problems 

00:03:13.689 --> 00:03:15.279
 he is not the case 

00:03:15.279 --> 00:03:18.819
 it is not clear if I because I think with the LEDs transmitter not 

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:21.980
 Birthday he does not need much 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:25.269
 to protect our children from the dangers of the virtual world 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:30.070
 There are actually three things to consider 

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:33.920
 The first thing is that you should not give any data of yourself the price yourself 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:37.120
 also on the printed posters to the bus stop hang Bader 

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:41.400
 the further that you look because we spend a lot of time I actually one 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:42.050
 calculator 

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:44.729
 you still have time for other things or not 

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:48.139
 and the third ass that communication between parents and 

00:03:48.139 --> 00:03:52.419
 Children should always be there Nano just talk about what will happen 

00:03:52.419 --> 00:03:53.599
 made and 

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:56.689
 As fascinating as the virtual world may be 

00:03:56.689 --> 00:03:59.099
 One should not forget one thing 

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:02.049
 only real life can be enjoyed with all senses
