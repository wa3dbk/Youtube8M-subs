can<00:01:52.920> pretty<00:01:53.130> much<00:01:53.270> destroy<00:01:54.270> your<00:01:54.570> game<00:01:54.810> if<00:01:55.079> you

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
can pretty much destroy your game if you

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.469 
can pretty much destroy your game if you
ended<00:01:55.560> up<00:01:55.680> getting<00:01:55.920> invaded<00:01:56.189> early<00:01:56.670> on<00:01:56.909> you

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
ended up getting invaded early on you

ended up getting invaded early on you

complete<00:02:02.100> devour<00:02:02.490> by<00:02:02.850> like<00:02:03.030> the<00:02:03.180> 20-minute

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
complete devour by like the 20-minute

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.959 
complete devour by like the 20-minute
mark<00:02:03.990> and<00:02:04.380> you'll<00:02:05.189> get<00:02:05.310> four<00:02:05.549> stood<00:02:05.729> in<00:02:05.820> team

escale is extremely well with

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.319 
escale is extremely well with
our<00:02:13.739> because<00:02:14.189> obviously<00:02:14.430> you<00:02:14.849> can<00:02:15.000> get<00:02:15.150> other

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:15.329 
our because obviously you can get other

on-hit effects item was with kale is

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:19.910 
on-hit effects item was with kale is
considering<00:02:18.120> that<00:02:18.209> she's<00:02:18.420> a<00:02:18.569> hybrid<00:02:19.019> champion

considering that she's a hybrid champion
the<00:02:20.849> major<00:02:21.090> problem<00:02:21.239> is<00:02:21.720> is<00:02:21.930> that<00:02:21.959> basically

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
the major problem is is that basically

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.610 
the major problem is is that basically
it's<00:02:22.769> making<00:02:23.730> York<00:02:24.239> you<00:02:24.720> and<00:02:24.959> your<00:02:25.140> W

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
it's making York you and your W

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.190 
it's making York you and your W
worthless<00:02:26.480> obviously<00:02:27.480> if<00:02:27.689> you're<00:02:27.840> going<00:02:28.049> to

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
worthless obviously if you're going to

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.839 
worthless obviously if you're going to
vow<00:02:28.379> her<00:02:28.590> you're<00:02:28.860> going<00:02:28.980> to<00:02:29.040> get<00:02:29.189> other<00:02:29.430> on-hit

00:02:29.839 --> 00:02:29.849 
vow her you're going to get other on-hit

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:32.089 
vow her you're going to get other on-hit
effects<00:02:30.150> if<00:02:30.780> you<00:02:31.170> get<00:02:31.349> those<00:02:31.500> on<00:02:31.650> hit<00:02:31.799> affect

00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:32.099 
effects if you get those on hit affect

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:34.069 
effects if you get those on hit affect
items<00:02:32.370> and<00:02:32.640> you're<00:02:32.760> sacrificing<00:02:33.030> your<00:02:33.629> AP

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:34.079 
items and you're sacrificing your AP

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:37.640 
items and you're sacrificing your AP
items<00:02:34.470> and<00:02:34.879> also<00:02:35.879> you<00:02:36.329> don't<00:02:36.450> have<00:02:36.569> any<00:02:36.959> CDR

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
items and also you don't have any CDR

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.589 
items and also you don't have any CDR
from<00:02:37.950> devour<00:02:38.250> and<00:02:38.579> you<00:02:38.640> don't<00:02:38.849> have<00:02:39.030> any<00:02:39.209> men

00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:39.599 
from devour and you don't have any men

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:41.869 
from devour and you don't have any men
are<00:02:39.750> region<00:02:40.079> from<00:02:40.230> devour<00:02:40.560> so<00:02:41.250> you're

00:02:41.869 --> 00:02:41.879 
are region from devour so you're

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:43.429 
are region from devour so you're
obviously<00:02:42.060> going<00:02:42.659> to<00:02:42.780> have<00:02:42.900> to<00:02:43.049> buy<00:02:43.170> those

00:02:43.429 --> 00:02:43.439 
obviously going to have to buy those

00:02:43.439 --> 00:02:45.170 
obviously going to have to buy those
items<00:02:43.709> separately<00:02:44.220> which<00:02:44.670> is<00:02:44.819> going<00:02:44.970> to<00:02:45.030> take

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
items separately which is going to take

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:46.759 
items separately which is going to take
up<00:02:45.299> space<00:02:45.569> and<00:02:45.629> stop<00:02:46.049> you<00:02:46.170> from<00:02:46.260> your<00:02:46.440> complete

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:46.769 
up space and stop you from your complete

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:51.500 
up space and stop you from your complete
build<00:02:47.040> this<00:02:47.700> is<00:02:47.970> a<00:02:48.209> major<00:02:48.840> major<00:02:49.470> flaw<00:02:50.510> alright

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
build this is a major major flaw alright

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.960 
build this is a major major flaw alright
so<00:02:51.900> let's<00:02:52.440> look<00:02:52.650> at<00:02:52.799> her<00:02:52.950> scaling<00:02:53.400> ratios<00:02:53.790> as

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
so let's look at her scaling ratios as

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.030 
so let's look at her scaling ratios as
you<00:02:54.120> can<00:02:54.269> see<00:02:54.420> here<00:02:54.629> everything<00:02:55.290> that<00:02:55.319> she<00:02:55.799> has

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
you can see here everything that she has

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.940 
you can see here everything that she has
scales<00:02:56.670> off<00:02:56.909> of<00:02:57.090> AP<00:02:57.480> some<00:02:58.109> the<00:02:58.470> actual

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
scales off of AP some the actual

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:02.750 
scales off of AP some the actual
abilities<00:02:59.340> dual<00:03:00.180> scale<00:03:00.569> off<00:03:00.780> of<00:03:00.930> AP<00:03:01.230> so<00:03:01.829> her<00:03:02.220> Q

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
abilities dual scale off of AP so her Q

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.360 
abilities dual scale off of AP so her Q
scales<00:03:03.450> off<00:03:03.599> at<00:03:03.750> AP<00:03:04.049> by<00:03:04.230> sixty<00:03:04.590> percent<00:03:04.709> which

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
scales off at AP by sixty percent which

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:08.720 
scales off at AP by sixty percent which
is<00:03:05.549> really<00:03:06.120> awesome<00:03:06.379> her<00:03:07.379> w<00:03:08.220> which<00:03:08.459> is<00:03:08.609> her

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
is really awesome her w which is her

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.729 
is really awesome her w which is her
heel<00:03:09.060> and<00:03:09.269> a<00:03:09.329> remove<00:03:09.599> minus<00:03:09.930> book<00:03:10.139> has<00:03:10.560> a

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:10.739 
heel and a remove minus book has a

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:13.039 
heel and a remove minus book has a
45-percent<00:03:11.400> AP<00:03:11.970> scaling<00:03:12.329> ratio<00:03:12.659> and<00:03:12.870> her

00:03:13.039 --> 00:03:13.049 
45-percent AP scaling ratio and her

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:15.349 
45-percent AP scaling ratio and her
movement<00:03:13.470> speed<00:03:13.739> buff<00:03:13.980> has<00:03:14.489> a<00:03:14.519> seven<00:03:15.060> percent

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:15.359 
movement speed buff has a seven percent

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:18.979 
movement speed buff has a seven percent
ap<00:03:15.780> scaling<00:03:16.170> ratio<00:03:16.470> out<00:03:16.680> of<00:03:16.799> /<00:03:17.010> 108<00:03:17.639> P<00:03:17.819> so<00:03:18.510> this

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
ap scaling ratio out of / 108 P so this

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:21.140 
ap scaling ratio out of / 108 P so this
is<00:03:19.379> very<00:03:19.500> major<00:03:19.829> for<00:03:20.250> slowing<00:03:20.639> and<00:03:20.940> then

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
is very major for slowing and then

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.530 
is very major for slowing and then
kiting<00:03:21.629> away<00:03:22.129> so<00:03:23.129> the<00:03:23.340> more<00:03:23.519> AP<00:03:23.790> you<00:03:23.910> have<00:03:24.120> more

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
kiting away so the more AP you have more

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:25.699 
kiting away so the more AP you have more
movement<00:03:24.930> speed<00:03:25.139> buff<00:03:25.319> you'll<00:03:25.530> have

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:25.709 
movement speed buff you'll have

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:28.909 
movement speed buff you'll have
basically<00:03:26.400> if<00:03:26.639> you<00:03:26.790> have<00:03:27.060> a<00:03:27.299> full<00:03:27.870> build<00:03:28.290> you

00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:28.919 
basically if you have a full build you

00:03:28.919 --> 00:03:31.039 
basically if you have a full build you
can<00:03:29.099> essentially<00:03:29.519> remove<00:03:30.209> your<00:03:30.419> boots<00:03:30.599> out<00:03:30.840> of

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:31.049 
can essentially remove your boots out of

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:33.140 
can essentially remove your boots out of
the<00:03:31.139> equation<00:03:31.530> and<00:03:31.919> buy<00:03:32.159> another<00:03:32.310> AP<00:03:32.819> item

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
the equation and buy another AP item

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:36.050 
the equation and buy another AP item
because<00:03:33.659> of<00:03:33.810> her<00:03:33.930> w<00:03:34.290> allows<00:03:34.500> it<00:03:35.060> because

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
because of her w allows it because

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:37.189 
because of her w allows it because
she'll<00:03:36.269> basically<00:03:36.569> have<00:03:36.720> enough<00:03:36.959> movement

00:03:37.189 --> 00:03:37.199 
she'll basically have enough movement

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:39.050 
she'll basically have enough movement
speed<00:03:37.560> to<00:03:38.010> basically<00:03:38.280> run<00:03:38.519> around<00:03:38.790> all<00:03:38.909> the

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
speed to basically run around all the

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.689 
speed to basically run around all the
map<00:03:39.239> and<00:03:39.510> she'll<00:03:39.900> be<00:03:39.989> able<00:03:40.019> to<00:03:40.260> spam<00:03:40.530> her<00:03:40.680> w<00:03:41.010> so

00:03:41.689 --> 00:03:41.699 
map and she'll be able to spam her w so

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:44.869

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:57.020

if you decide to go devour you're going

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:59.270 
if you decide to go devour you're going

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
to be sacrificing these ap scaling

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:02.390 
to be sacrificing these ap scaling
ratios<00:03:59.699> which<00:04:00.150> kale<00:04:00.750> is<00:04:01.079> amazing<00:04:01.949> with<00:04:02.099> and

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
ratios which kale is amazing with and

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.909 
ratios which kale is amazing with and
you<00:04:03.120> might<00:04:03.299> be<00:04:03.449> saying<00:04:03.629> fifteen<00:04:04.290> percent<00:04:04.560> ap

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:04.919 
you might be saying fifteen percent ap

00:04:04.919 --> 00:04:06.710 
you might be saying fifteen percent ap
scaling<00:04:05.549> ratio<00:04:05.849> and<00:04:06.000> thirty<00:04:06.180> percent<00:04:06.449> ap

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720

scaling ratio and thirty percent ap
scaling<00:04:07.079> ratios<00:04:07.409> nothing<00:04:07.799> but<00:04:08.250> in<00:04:08.430> all

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:08.609 
scaling ratios nothing but in all

00:04:08.609 --> 00:04:14.539 
scaling ratios nothing but in all
honesty<00:04:09.120> it<00:04:09.269> is<00:04:09.479> freaking<00:04:10.079> major<00:04:13.400> alright<00:04:14.400> so

00:04:14.539 --> 00:04:14.549 
honesty it is freaking major alright so

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:16.310 
honesty it is freaking major alright so
the<00:04:14.639> conclusion<00:04:14.849> is<00:04:15.329> is<00:04:15.540> that<00:04:15.690> rune<00:04:15.930> glyph<00:04:16.049> has

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 
the conclusion is is that rune glyph has

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.649 
the conclusion is is that rune glyph has
one<00:04:16.590> rune<00:04:17.400> glyph<00:04:17.549> is<00:04:17.849> just<00:04:18.060> obviously<00:04:18.479> the

00:04:18.649 --> 00:04:18.659 
one rune glyph is just obviously the

00:04:18.659 --> 00:04:21.500 
one rune glyph is just obviously the
better<00:04:18.810> choice<00:04:19.130> it's<00:04:20.130> busy<00:04:20.519> an<00:04:20.609> AP<00:04:20.909> item<00:04:21.209> so

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:21.510 
better choice it's busy an AP item so

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:23.510 
better choice it's busy an AP item so
you<00:04:21.570> can<00:04:21.779> essentially<00:04:22.229> stack<00:04:22.650> full<00:04:23.099> AP

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:23.520 
you can essentially stack full AP

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:26.700 
you can essentially stack full AP
instead<00:04:24.360> of<00:04:24.450> having<00:04:24.630> to<00:04:24.750> stack<00:04:25.080> a<00:04:25.289> few<00:04:25.889> attacks

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:26.710 
instead of having to stack a few attacks

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:29.520 
instead of having to stack a few attacks
and<00:04:27.220> then<00:04:27.490> ap<00:04:28.360> items<00:04:28.690> which<00:04:29.080> would<00:04:29.229> then<00:04:29.350> be

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:29.530 
and then ap items which would then be

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:33.540 
and then ap items which would then be
hybrid<00:04:29.979> attack<00:04:30.280> speed<00:04:30.520> ap<00:04:30.970> which<00:04:31.569> is<00:04:31.889> ok<00:04:32.889> but

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:33.550 
hybrid attack speed ap which is ok but

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:35.279 
hybrid attack speed ap which is ok but
rune<00:04:33.850> clave<00:04:34.060> is<00:04:34.090> just<00:04:34.419> better<00:04:34.600> that<00:04:34.990> is<00:04:35.139> why

00:04:35.279 --> 00:04:35.289 
rune clave is just better that is why

00:04:35.289 --> 00:04:37.050 
rune clave is just better that is why
the<00:04:35.349> Challenger<00:04:35.949> level<00:04:36.190> players<00:04:36.430> are<00:04:36.669> going

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:37.060 
the Challenger level players are going

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:39.210 
the Challenger level players are going
room<00:04:37.479> grave<00:04:37.780> because<00:04:38.229> room<00:04:38.919> glaives

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:39.220 
room grave because room glaives

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:41.520 
room grave because room glaives
correctly<00:04:39.940> is<00:04:40.120> much<00:04:40.419> better<00:04:40.690> now<00:04:41.199> if<00:04:41.380> you're

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:41.530 
correctly is much better now if you're

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:43.080 
correctly is much better now if you're
on<00:04:41.650> bronze<00:04:41.949> or<00:04:42.250> silver<00:04:42.280> and<00:04:42.849> you're<00:04:42.970> not

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:43.090 
on bronze or silver and you're not

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:44.460 
on bronze or silver and you're not
really<00:04:43.240> that<00:04:43.449> good<00:04:43.599> at<00:04:43.660> mechanics<00:04:44.169> then

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:44.470 
really that good at mechanics then

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:46.379 
really that good at mechanics then
devours<00:04:45.039> definitely<00:04:45.610> for<00:04:45.789> you<00:04:45.910> because<00:04:46.210> all

00:04:46.379 --> 00:04:46.389 
devours definitely for you because all

00:04:46.389 --> 00:04:47.969 
devours definitely for you because all
you<00:04:46.479> have<00:04:46.599> to<00:04:46.720> do<00:04:46.810> is<00:04:46.930> hit<00:04:47.080> and<00:04:47.380> click<00:04:47.620> someone

00:04:47.969 --> 00:04:47.979 
you have to do is hit and click someone

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:49.650 
you have to do is hit and click someone
and<00:04:48.130> you're<00:04:48.460> going<00:04:48.669> to<00:04:48.759> nuke<00:04:48.940> them<00:04:49.150> down<00:04:49.389> just

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:49.660 
and you're going to nuke them down just

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:52.740 
and you're going to nuke them down just
about<00:04:50.500> as<00:04:50.650> much<00:04:51.130> but<00:04:51.699> the<00:04:51.819> problem<00:04:52.270> is<00:04:52.509> is<00:04:52.720> that

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:52.750 
about as much but the problem is is that

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:55.170 
about as much but the problem is is that
you're<00:04:52.990> sacrificing<00:04:53.289> a<00:04:54.069> ton<00:04:54.610> of<00:04:54.639> movement

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:55.180 
you're sacrificing a ton of movement

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:57.480 
you're sacrificing a ton of movement
speed<00:04:55.419> a<00:04:55.569> ton<00:04:55.930> of<00:04:55.960> heel<00:04:56.319> bonus<00:04:56.710> and<00:04:56.919> a<00:04:57.220> ton<00:04:57.460> of

damage on your queue for a upgrade a

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:03.300 
damage on your queue for a upgrade a
ability<00:05:01.870> which<00:05:02.289> is<00:05:02.470> not<00:05:02.710> really<00:05:02.740> that

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:03.310 
ability which is not really that

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:05.580 
ability which is not really that
massively<00:05:03.910> improved<00:05:04.360> from<00:05:04.810> the<00:05:04.870> rune<00:05:05.440> blade

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:05.590

trash one's not just a rune blade kale
with<00:05:21.909> better<00:05:22.180> mechanics<00:05:22.810> it's<00:05:23.020> just<00:05:23.409> overall

00:05:23.909 --> 00:05:23.919 
with better mechanics it's just overall

00:05:23.919 --> 00:05:26.820 
with better mechanics it's just overall
superior<00:05:24.819> to<00:05:25.060> the<00:05:25.180> Devourer<00:05:25.449> kale<00:05:25.870> awesome

rune<00:05:27.190> blade<00:05:27.310> is<00:05:27.610> just<00:05:27.880> better<00:05:28.150> off<00:05:28.270> because

00:05:28.649 --> 00:05:28.659 
rune blade is just better off because

00:05:28.659 --> 00:05:30.270 
rune blade is just better off because
the<00:05:28.870> second<00:05:29.229> you<00:05:29.259> build<00:05:29.560> the<00:05:29.680> item<00:05:29.979> you<00:05:30.099> have

the second you build the item you have

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:31.710 
the second you build the item you have

your power spike instead of having to
