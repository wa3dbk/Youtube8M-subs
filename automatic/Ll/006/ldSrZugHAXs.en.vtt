00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 hello my name is alain I will you 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.350
 talk today about the solar system and 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:08.400
 starting from the beginning 

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:11.790
 how can we define the system 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:14.870
 solar the solar system what is it eh 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:18.750
 well we can define the solar system 

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:20.900
 like the set of objects ruled by 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.460
 the gravitational attraction of the sun 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.820
 in the center of the solar system there is the 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.269
 Sun 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:30.750
 it's a huge ball of gas that by its 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.640
 extraordinary mass governs all this small 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.780
 world 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:36.020
 all the inhabitants of the solar system 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.129
 are under the rule of the sun king 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:40.500
 now that we have defined the system 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:43.230
 solar we can now we counted 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.660
 to count the members that is this 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.059
 that there is in the solar system well 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.789
 a star a star is not a 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.440
 obliged of the solar system because a star 

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:54.780
 do not turn around the sun because 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:58.739
 actually all the objects in the system 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:01.050
 solar revolves around the sun so at 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:05.040
 start with the sun the first 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.630
 member of the solar system then we have 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.790
 lille 8 planets 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:14.150
 it's planets of the solar system that 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:17.600
 his mercury venus the earth mars jupiter 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:20.430
 saturne uranus and neptune 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.240
 these are the largest bodies found 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.590
 in the solar system 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:27.540
 then we have the dwarf planets 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.610
 so have a few new items 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.159
 we will talk about it later that they are 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.630
 appeared in the landscape and that are not 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.280
 quite planets too small 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.470
 evidence of planets but objects 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:42.479
 quite consistent among this category 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:43.049
 of objects we find crs pluton the old 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.119
 planet 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:47.850
 and then news of new objects 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:50.729
 its water but bristles cleansing 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.090
 mac and what else in the system 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.590
 solar 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:56.570
 well we also have a 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:58.850
 a lot of satellites the 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:01.880
 planet satellites the moon by 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:06.229
 example and the planet's satellite 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:08.569
 earth and to all the planets but 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:11.959
 almost all planets have 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:14.660
 Satellite e.g. Jupiter moon 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:18.010
 to their body from one to the lap of dell 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:20.299
 with about sixty satellites 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:23.930
 we then have in this big 

00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:25.940
 solar system family of 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:31.069
 asteroids and asteroids 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:33.799
 these are irregular bodies do not deserve 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:35.349
 not the name of planet but who are 

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:38.569
 countless we currently have 

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:40.310
 500 miles that we discovered well 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:40.900
 probably millions of 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:43.700
 billion 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:45.230
 the main tank is located between 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:49.040
 march and jupiter 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:51.260
 there is another beyond 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:53.540
 last planet neptune 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:55.790
 but actually the asteroids are 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:56.980
 found absolutely everywhere in the 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:59.709
 solar system 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:03.920
 what do we have others we also have 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:06.769
 Comets commit them we count 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:09.709
 a few hundred and unlike 

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:11.720
 asteroids are active objects 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:14.209
 the haired stars that we know 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:17.030
 since antiquity are ice objects 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:20.780
 and kiala close to the sun is developing well 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:23.569
 a wonderful show an activity 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:29.090
 cometary it's just ice 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:30.680
 who is vaporizing so we have already full 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:32.450
 of the world the sun the planet planet 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:33.609
 is the satellites the asteroids and 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:38.690
 comets 

00:03:33.609 --> 00:03:40.819
 what else do not we think about it 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:42.260
 often but there are things there are 

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:44.299
 still new things in the system 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:46.599
 solar are things of matter 

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:49.130
 between the planets 

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:52.849
 there is dust because actually 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:55.849
 there is much more matter between 

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:57.109
 planets are between two stars and 

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:57.590
 in the solar system there are 

00:03:57.109 --> 00:04:01.220
 dust 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:02.610
 there is gas and all this beautiful people too 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:07.500
 obeyed 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:10.810
 in the sun so turn around the sun 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:12.180
 is there finally that are there others in the 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:14.770
 solar system 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:17.590
 well there are things that are 

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:21.580
 appeared relatively recently in 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:22.420
 history with the advent of the 

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:24.940
 space conquest 

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:26.890
 from the 60's is the man 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:27.720
 introduced new objects into the 

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:32.110
 solar system 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:33.520
 these objects also obey the law of 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:36.130
 sun since it revolves around the sun 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:38.410
 are subject to attraction 

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:40.360
 gravitational sun these objects 

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:42.790
 are interplanetary probes 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:46.240
 we launched since the 60s 70 

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:48.760
 even recently and the older ones that 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:50.890
 are the sounds of travelers and pioneers 

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:52.110
 are really on the edge of our 

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:56.770
 solar system 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:58.960
 beyond the planet anr at + 2 from 

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:01.870
 a few several billion 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:04.870
 kilometers from here so here is the family 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:08.290
 of the solar system that is very numerous 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:12.700
 and very diverse and that is characterized 

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:16.380
 by a single definition that of 

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:16.380
 turn around the sun
