00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
live with villages I started out by

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.030 
live with villages I started out by
simply<00:00:08.189> finding<00:00:08.639> a<00:00:08.880> village<00:00:09.240> and<00:00:09.740> from<00:00:10.740> there

simply finding a village and from there

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.820 
simply finding a village and from there
built<00:00:11.250> a<00:00:11.370> little<00:00:11.580> house<00:00:11.849> inside<00:00:12.750> or<00:00:13.500> nearby

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
built a little house inside or nearby

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.590 
built a little house inside or nearby
and<00:00:15.260> proceeded<00:00:16.260> to<00:00:16.289> make<00:00:16.650> a<00:00:16.680> wall

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:17.600 
and proceeded to make a wall

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.210 
and proceeded to make a wall
approximately<00:00:18.600> three<00:00:18.779> squares<00:00:19.080> high<00:00:19.500> at

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
approximately three squares high at

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.050 
approximately three squares high at
least<00:00:20.670> around<00:00:21.119> the<00:00:21.750> village<00:00:21.990> itself<00:00:22.350> so

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:23.060 
least around the village itself so

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:25.179 
least around the village itself so
basically<00:00:24.060> put<00:00:24.300> around<00:00:24.510> a<00:00:24.660> little<00:00:24.779> perimeter

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:25.189 
basically put around a little perimeter

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:28.460 
basically put around a little perimeter
this<00:00:26.189> is<00:00:26.400> to<00:00:26.580> help<00:00:27.359> keep<00:00:27.570> out<00:00:27.750> any<00:00:27.990> sort<00:00:28.349> of

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
this is to help keep out any sort of

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.790 
this is to help keep out any sort of
zombies<00:00:29.010> and<00:00:29.400> creepers<00:00:29.990> and<00:00:30.990> those<00:00:31.380> sorts<00:00:31.740> of

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:42.729 
to stay within the confines of the area
some<00:00:41.550> of<00:00:41.610> the<00:00:41.670> problems<00:00:42.030> obviously<00:00:42.270> that

00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:42.739 
some of the problems obviously that

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:44.690 
some of the problems obviously that
happen<00:00:43.739> when<00:00:44.219> you<00:00:44.309> leave<00:00:44.489> the<00:00:44.610> village

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
happen when you leave the village

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.940 
happen when you leave the village
unattended<00:00:45.270> is<00:00:45.600> unfortunately<00:00:46.350> they<00:00:46.800> get

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
unattended is unfortunately they get

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.700 
unattended is unfortunately they get
attacked<00:00:47.250> and<00:00:47.460> can<00:00:47.640> die<00:00:47.930> so<00:00:48.930> what<00:00:49.170> I<00:00:49.230> did<00:00:49.350> was

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
attacked and can die so what I did was

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.100 
attacked and can die so what I did was
after<00:00:50.190> setting<00:00:50.700> up<00:00:50.760> the<00:00:50.820> perimeter<00:00:51.090> I<00:00:51.510> put

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
after setting up the perimeter I put

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.290 
after setting up the perimeter I put
down<00:00:52.230> a<00:00:52.289> load<00:00:52.710> of<00:00:52.920> torches<00:00:53.430> in<00:00:53.670> any<00:00:53.850> areas<00:00:54.270> that

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
down a load of torches in any areas that

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.290 
down a load of torches in any areas that
were<00:00:55.079> deemed<00:00:55.289> dark<00:00:55.649> what<00:00:56.520> you<00:00:56.610> can<00:00:56.760> see<00:00:57.030> is

when you actually look at the sundial

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.399 
when you actually look at the sundial
that<00:01:05.339> I've<00:01:05.610> got<00:01:05.970> in<00:01:06.090> my<00:01:06.210> hand<00:01:06.479> you<00:01:07.200> can<00:01:07.229> see

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
that I've got in my hand you can see

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.560 
that I've got in my hand you can see
that<00:01:07.740> it<00:01:07.860> is<00:01:07.979> in<00:01:08.130> fact<00:01:08.310> midnight<00:01:08.760> you<00:01:09.360> can<00:01:09.390> see

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
that it is in fact midnight you can see

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.310 
that it is in fact midnight you can see
overall<00:01:10.080> there<00:01:10.320> it<00:01:10.530> is<00:01:11.100> really<00:01:11.580> dark<00:01:11.760> and

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:12.320 
overall there it is really dark and

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.149 
overall there it is really dark and
walking<00:01:13.320> up<00:01:13.439> there<00:01:13.619> you'll<00:01:13.770> probably<00:01:13.920> be

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
walking up there you'll probably be

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.810 
walking up there you'll probably be
attacked<00:01:14.520> and<00:01:15.030> killed<00:01:15.950> so<00:01:16.950> this<00:01:17.310> way<00:01:17.490> you<00:01:17.549> can

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
attacked and killed so this way you can

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.390 
attacked and killed so this way you can
carry<00:01:18.299> on<00:01:18.390> with<00:01:18.659> any<00:01:18.869> farming<00:01:19.500> and<00:01:19.799> any<00:01:20.189> sort

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
of things you want to do inside the base

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.160 
of things you want to do inside the base
so<00:01:23.189> you<00:01:23.220> don't<00:01:23.490> really<00:01:23.580> run<00:01:24.240> out<00:01:24.390> of<00:01:24.420> time<00:01:24.810> and

night so there's not really too much to
it<00:01:59.450> you<00:02:00.450> have<00:02:00.600> to<00:02:00.719> play<00:02:00.960> test<00:02:01.200> it<00:02:01.380> a<00:02:01.439> little<00:02:01.680> bit

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
it you have to play test it a little bit

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.440 
it you have to play test it a little bit
to<00:02:01.950> make<00:02:02.100> sure<00:02:02.130> that<00:02:02.399> at<00:02:02.520> night<00:02:02.729> nothing<00:02:03.240> does

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
to make sure that at night nothing does

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.840 
to make sure that at night nothing does
come<00:02:03.719> through<00:02:03.930> any<00:02:04.110> dark<00:02:04.439> spots<00:02:04.740> so<00:02:05.579> I<00:02:05.610> thought

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
come through any dark spots so I thought

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.320 
come through any dark spots so I thought
I'd<00:02:05.969> end<00:02:06.149> it<00:02:06.329> with<00:02:06.869> a<00:02:07.079> little<00:02:07.680> bit<00:02:07.799> of<00:02:07.920> a

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.330 
I'd end it with a little bit of a

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.390 
I'd end it with a little bit of a
entrance<00:02:09.330> into<00:02:09.720> the<00:02:10.590> village<00:02:10.830> itself<00:02:11.220> which

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
entrance into the village itself which

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.070 
entrance into the village itself which
is<00:02:11.580> quite<00:02:11.940> a<00:02:11.970> basic<00:02:12.150> redstone

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
is quite a basic redstone

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.080 
is quite a basic redstone
app<00:02:13.200> if<00:02:13.740> you<00:02:14.130> just<00:02:14.370> have<00:02:14.490> a<00:02:14.520> look<00:02:14.700> at<00:02:14.850> it<00:02:14.940> you

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
app if you just have a look at it you

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:18.530 
app if you just have a look at it you
can<00:02:15.240> see<00:02:15.390> consists<00:02:15.930> of<00:02:16.820> redstone<00:02:17.820> a<00:02:18.180> couple<00:02:18.450> of

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
can see consists of redstone a couple of

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.050 
can see consists of redstone a couple of
switches<00:02:18.750> and<00:02:19.200> some<00:02:19.350> trapdoors<00:02:20.060> fairly

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
switches and some trapdoors fairly

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.180 
switches and some trapdoors fairly
simplistic<00:02:21.480> fairly<00:02:21.960> basic<00:02:22.140> but<00:02:22.560> to<00:02:22.890> be<00:02:22.980> honest

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
simplistic fairly basic but to be honest

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:25.280 
simplistic fairly basic but to be honest
I<00:02:23.250> don't<00:02:23.370> really<00:02:23.580> use<00:02:23.790> it<00:02:24.020> normally<00:02:25.020> I<00:02:25.260> just

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
I don't really use it normally I just

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:26.960 
I don't really use it normally I just
cut<00:02:25.590> a<00:02:25.620> hole<00:02:25.680> through<00:02:25.980> the<00:02:26.160> wall<00:02:26.190> and<00:02:26.640> seal<00:02:26.850> it

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
cut a hole through the wall and seal it

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.600 
cut a hole through the wall and seal it
up<00:02:27.000> behind<00:02:27.210> me<00:02:27.680> but<00:02:28.680> there<00:02:29.130> is<00:02:29.250> a<00:02:29.310> nice<00:02:29.460> little

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
up behind me but there is a nice little

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.060 
up behind me but there is a nice little
function<00:02:29.820> to<00:02:30.090> end<00:02:30.240> on<00:02:30.470> it's<00:02:31.470> pretty<00:02:31.710> much<00:02:31.890> the

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.070 
function to end on it's pretty much the

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:34.400 
function to end on it's pretty much the
end<00:02:32.220> of<00:02:32.520> the<00:02:32.730> first<00:02:32.940> part<00:02:33.210> on<00:02:33.420> how<00:02:34.080> to<00:02:34.140> protect
