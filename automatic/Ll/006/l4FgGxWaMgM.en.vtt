polymethylmethacrylate acrylic but we
actually<00:00:30.029> white<00:00:30.449> -<00:00:30.779> yeah<00:00:31.529> they<00:00:31.980> have<00:00:32.099> a<00:00:32.160> very

actually white - yeah they have a very
very<00:00:32.600> realistic<00:00:33.600> reflection<00:00:34.440> Wow<00:00:34.890> okay<00:00:35.640> so

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
very realistic reflection Wow okay so

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.220 
very realistic reflection Wow okay so
how<00:00:36.180> does<00:00:36.239> this<00:00:36.450> how<00:00:36.570> do<00:00:36.630> you<00:00:36.719> actually<00:00:36.930> get

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
how does this how do you actually get

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.540 
how does this how do you actually get
this<00:00:37.380> into<00:00:37.710> your<00:00:37.739> eye<00:00:37.890> how<00:00:38.100> does<00:00:38.250> that<00:00:38.370> work

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
this into your eye how does that work

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.119 
this into your eye how does that work
just<00:00:38.910> like<00:00:39.809> a<00:00:39.870> contact<00:00:40.410> lens<00:00:40.530> right<00:00:40.860> it's<00:00:41.040> like

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
just like a contact lens right it's like

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.430 
just like a contact lens right it's like
think<00:00:41.430> of<00:00:41.489> it<00:00:41.610> as<00:00:41.700> a<00:00:41.730> large<00:00:42.180> contact<00:00:42.600> lens<00:00:42.870> most

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
think of it as a large contact lens most

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.200 
think of it as a large contact lens most
people<00:00:43.739> think<00:00:43.950> that<00:00:44.100> a<00:00:44.250> the<00:00:44.640> artificial<00:00:45.000> eye

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
people think that a the artificial eye

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.029 
people think that a the artificial eye
is<00:00:45.270> an<00:00:45.570> exact<00:00:45.899> duplicate<00:00:46.350> of<00:00:46.379> the<00:00:46.559> eye<00:00:46.590> and

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
is an exact duplicate of the eye and

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.400 
is an exact duplicate of the eye and
think<00:00:47.520> of<00:00:47.820> a<00:00:47.910> globe<00:00:48.149> like<00:00:48.300> this<00:00:48.539> blends<00:00:49.320> that

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
think of a globe like this blends that

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.229 
think of a globe like this blends that
you're<00:00:49.590> carrying<00:00:49.860> right<00:00:49.890> there<00:00:50.250> but<00:00:50.430> in<00:00:50.579> truth

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
you're carrying right there but in truth

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.360 
you're carrying right there but in truth
it's<00:00:51.510> actually<00:00:51.870> a<00:00:51.899> half<00:00:52.140> shell<00:00:52.440> so<00:00:53.160> an

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
it's actually a half shell so an

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:54.650 
it's actually a half shell so an
ophthalmologist<00:00:53.969> will<00:00:54.120> remove<00:00:54.360> the<00:00:54.510> eye

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
ophthalmologist will remove the eye

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.990 
ophthalmologist will remove the eye
they'll<00:00:55.350> implant<00:00:55.770> a<00:00:56.039> spherical<00:00:56.520> implant<00:00:56.879> to

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
they'll implant a spherical implant to

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.819 
they'll implant a spherical implant to
replace<00:00:57.300> the<00:00:57.449> volume<00:00:57.600> lost<00:00:58.050> by<00:00:58.320> the<00:00:58.379> removal

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
replace the volume lost by the removal

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.680 
replace the volume lost by the removal
of<00:00:58.859> the<00:00:58.980> eye<00:00:59.010> and<00:00:59.309> then<00:00:59.789> the<00:01:00.149> artificial<00:01:00.480> eye

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
of the eye and then the artificial eye

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.270 
of the eye and then the artificial eye
the<00:01:00.750> prosthetic<00:01:01.320> actually<00:01:01.590> fits<00:01:01.800> up<00:01:01.920> in<00:01:02.039> front

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
the prosthetic actually fits up in front

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.429 
the prosthetic actually fits up in front
so<00:01:02.550> it's<00:01:02.670> really<00:01:02.760> a<00:01:02.850> custom<00:01:03.300> fit<00:01:03.660> correct<00:01:04.290> and

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
so it's really a custom fit correct and

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:05.870 
so it's really a custom fit correct and
does<00:01:04.559> that<00:01:04.710> help<00:01:04.890> it<00:01:05.010> move<00:01:05.159> around<00:01:05.280> so<00:01:05.670> people

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
does that help it move around so people

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.490 
does that help it move around so people
can't<00:01:06.180> tell<00:01:06.390> just<00:01:06.600> looking<00:01:06.689> at<00:01:06.930> you<00:01:07.140> yeah<00:01:07.380> the

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
can't tell just looking at you yeah the

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.590 
can't tell just looking at you yeah the
new<00:01:07.619> modern<00:01:07.860> techniques<00:01:08.640> of<00:01:08.820> implants<00:01:09.390> and

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
new modern techniques of implants and

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.510 
new modern techniques of implants and
pegging<00:01:09.900> systems<00:01:10.320> really<00:01:10.770> help<00:01:10.979> the<00:01:11.220> motility

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
pegging systems really help the motility

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.370 
pegging systems really help the motility
of<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:12.030> new<00:01:12.210> prosthetics<00:01:12.570> speaking<00:01:13.290> of

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
of the new prosthetics speaking of

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:14.929 
of the new prosthetics speaking of
realistic<00:01:13.710> hearing<00:01:14.130> you<00:01:14.220> cannot<00:01:14.460> even<00:01:14.670> tell

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
realistic hearing you cannot even tell

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.730 
realistic hearing you cannot even tell
looking<00:01:15.360> at<00:01:15.509> you<00:01:15.689> how<00:01:15.869> does<00:01:16.020> it<00:01:16.140> feel<00:01:16.380> actually

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
looking at you how does it feel actually

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.160 
looking at you how does it feel actually
having<00:01:16.979> one<00:01:17.100> of<00:01:17.159> these<00:01:17.340> in<00:01:17.580> place<00:01:17.880> it's<00:01:18.869> great

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
having one of these in place it's great

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:24.050 
having one of these in place it's great
I<00:01:19.710> actually<00:01:20.640> when<00:01:21.150> I<00:01:21.180> was<00:01:21.479> a<00:01:21.869> child<00:01:22.189> my<00:01:23.189> mom

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
I actually when I was a child my mom

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.450 
I actually when I was a child my mom
taught<00:01:24.360> me<00:01:24.390> I<00:01:24.840> was<00:01:25.500> not<00:01:25.710> treated<00:01:26.040> like<00:01:26.070> I<00:01:26.310> was

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
taught me I was not treated like I was

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.600 
taught me I was not treated like I was
disabled<00:01:27.270> at<00:01:27.360> all<00:01:27.509> but<00:01:28.350> they<00:01:28.650> found<00:01:28.920> out<00:01:29.189> I

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
disabled at all but they found out I

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.149 
disabled at all but they found out I
kept<00:01:30.150> moving<00:01:30.299> my<00:01:30.600> head<00:01:30.810> like<00:01:31.049> this<00:01:31.350> when<00:01:31.829> I<00:01:31.860> was

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
kept moving my head like this when I was

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.210 
kept moving my head like this when I was
little<00:01:32.520> so<00:01:32.700> mine<00:01:33.360> actually<00:01:34.079> does<00:01:34.320> not<00:01:34.530> move

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
little so mine actually does not move

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.969 
little so mine actually does not move
around<00:01:35.369> I'm<00:01:36.090> the<00:01:36.299> old<00:01:36.540> technology<00:01:37.290> look<00:01:37.890> at

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
around I'm the old technology look at

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.910 
around I'm the old technology look at
the<00:01:38.070> age<00:01:38.189> as<00:01:38.460> well<00:01:38.610> a<00:01:39.320> great<00:01:40.320> father<00:01:40.650> actually

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
the age as well a great father actually

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.980 
the age as well a great father actually
we<00:01:41.460> were<00:01:41.549> talking<00:01:41.820> before<00:01:41.880> the<00:01:42.060> show<00:01:42.150> his<00:01:42.750> dad

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
we were talking before the show his dad

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.300 
we were talking before the show his dad
made<00:01:43.229> your<00:01:43.380> very<00:01:43.560> first<00:01:43.740> one<00:01:44.009> when<00:01:44.159> you<00:01:44.220> were

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
made your very first one when you were

also have operations overseas that I

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:28.610 
also have operations overseas that I
took<00:05:27.360> them<00:05:27.570> there<00:05:27.720> and<00:05:27.810> trained<00:05:28.500> them<00:05:28.590> a

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:28.620 
took them there and trained them a

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:29.960 
took them there and trained them a
little<00:05:28.770> differently<00:05:29.070> too<00:05:29.280> in<00:05:29.490> those

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:29.970

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:33.180 
operations and we will see they will

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:34.910

need<00:05:35.010> to<00:05:35.130> be<00:05:35.280> challenged<00:05:35.700> by<00:05:35.790> what<00:05:35.940> you<00:05:36.030> do

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:36.180 
need to be challenged by what you do

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:38.000 
need to be challenged by what you do
because<00:05:36.690> work<00:05:37.050> is<00:05:37.260> one<00:05:37.620> third<00:05:37.770> of<00:05:37.830> your<00:05:37.950> life

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:38.010
