it now um I just got back I think this
is<00:00:11.370> my<00:00:11.580> be<00:00:11.759> my<00:00:11.790> like<00:00:12.090> third<00:00:12.389> match<00:00:12.660> third<00:00:13.110> or

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
is my be my like third match third or

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.169 
is my be my like third match third or
fourth<00:00:13.530> match<00:00:13.740> so<00:00:14.340> you<00:00:14.429> know<00:00:14.670> it's<00:00:15.030> probably

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
fourth match so you know it's probably

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.480 
fourth match so you know it's probably
not<00:00:15.480> the<00:00:15.509> best<00:00:15.630> gameplay<00:00:16.379> just<00:00:17.190> because<00:00:17.400> you

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
not the best gameplay just because you

to<00:00:32.009> really<00:00:32.430> learn<00:00:32.610> how<00:00:32.850> to<00:00:32.910> get<00:00:33.090> used<00:00:33.360> to<00:00:33.540> these

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
to really learn how to get used to these

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.860 
to really learn how to get used to these
maps<00:00:33.960> because<00:00:34.550> what<00:00:35.550> I<00:00:35.579> notice<00:00:36.000> is<00:00:36.120> the<00:00:36.600> maps

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
maps because what I notice is the maps

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.240 
maps because what I notice is the maps
the<00:00:37.260> match<00:00:37.410> kind<00:00:37.680> of<00:00:37.739> feel<00:00:37.890> a<00:00:37.920> little<00:00:38.100> bit

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
the match kind of feel a little bit

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.190 
the match kind of feel a little bit
bigger<00:00:38.520> than<00:00:38.760> like<00:00:39.090> maybe<00:00:39.450> modern<00:00:39.809> warfare<00:00:39.960> 2

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
bigger than like maybe modern warfare 2

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.110 
bigger than like maybe modern warfare 2
or<00:00:40.350> black<00:00:40.530> ops<00:00:40.829> I<00:00:41.070> feel<00:00:41.460> like<00:00:41.550> the<00:00:41.670> maps<00:00:41.910> you

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
or black ops I feel like the maps you

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.440 
or black ops I feel like the maps you
know<00:00:42.440> they<00:00:43.440> might<00:00:43.620> be<00:00:43.829> a<00:00:43.860> little<00:00:43.950> bit<00:00:44.250> like

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:44.450 
know they might be a little bit like

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:47.360 
know they might be a little bit like
deviled<00:00:45.450> i<00:00:45.539> would<00:00:45.660> say<00:00:45.840> maybe<00:00:46.680> maybe<00:00:47.039> a<00:00:47.190> little

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
deviled i would say maybe maybe a little

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:48.860 
deviled i would say maybe maybe a little
bit<00:00:47.520> less<00:00:47.760> than<00:00:47.969> deviled<00:00:48.329> from<00:00:48.450> like<00:00:48.570> a<00:00:48.600> black

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
bit less than deviled from like a black

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.529 
bit less than deviled from like a black
ops<00:00:49.110> map<00:00:49.320> but<00:00:49.980> they're<00:00:50.370> still<00:00:50.520> pretty<00:00:50.730> big<00:00:51.239> and

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
ops map but they're still pretty big and

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.720 
ops map but they're still pretty big and
you<00:00:52.260> know<00:00:52.379> there's<00:00:52.559> a<00:00:52.649> lot<00:00:52.800> to<00:00:52.949> do<00:00:53.160> in<00:00:53.489> like

00:03:16.899 --> 00:03:16.909 
commando that's pretty good but i think

00:03:16.909 --> 00:03:18.879 
commando that's pretty good but i think
there<00:03:17.150> are<00:03:17.419> like<00:03:17.720> two<00:03:17.930> perks<00:03:18.199> that<00:03:18.410> people<00:03:18.709> can

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:18.889 
there are like two perks that people can

00:03:18.889 --> 00:03:20.289 
there are like two perks that people can
mix<00:03:19.040> together<00:03:19.190> and<00:03:19.549> then<00:03:19.669> it<00:03:19.910> pretty<00:03:20.150> much

00:03:20.289 --> 00:03:20.299 
mix together and then it pretty much

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:22.689 
mix together and then it pretty much
creates<00:03:20.660> ghosts<00:03:21.019> but<00:03:21.680> we'll<00:03:22.310> see<00:03:22.519> how<00:03:22.549> that

00:03:22.689 --> 00:03:22.699 
creates ghosts but we'll see how that

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:24.909 
creates ghosts but we'll see how that
turns<00:03:22.849> out<00:03:23.269> let's<00:03:23.569> see<00:03:23.750> if<00:03:23.870> I<00:03:24.049> it's<00:03:24.290> abused

00:03:24.909 --> 00:03:24.919

00:03:58.930 --> 00:03:58.940 
to kill the person and then you have to

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:00.699 
to kill the person and then you have to
pick<00:03:59.120> up<00:03:59.239> their<00:03:59.329> dog<00:03:59.599> tag<00:03:59.900> to<00:04:00.079> really<00:04:00.319> confirm

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:02.329 
the kill and now where you can get

00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:05.020 
the kill and now where you can get
killstreaks<00:04:02.599> so<00:04:03.470> that's<00:04:03.620> pretty<00:04:03.859> cool<00:04:03.949> um<00:04:04.400> I

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:05.030 
killstreaks so that's pretty cool um I

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:06.369 
killstreaks so that's pretty cool um I
think<00:04:05.239> there's<00:04:05.599> like<00:04:05.629> one<00:04:05.900> like<00:04:06.109> team

00:04:06.369 --> 00:04:06.379 
think there's like one like team

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:08.589 
think there's like one like team
defender<00:04:06.980> or<00:04:07.099> something<00:04:07.400> like<00:04:07.489> that<00:04:07.549> I<00:04:07.879> I've

00:04:08.589 --> 00:04:08.599 
defender or something like that I I've

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:09.789 
defender or something like that I I've

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:11.870 
something with flags and you know i

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:13.270 
something with flags and you know i
don't<00:04:12.169> i<00:04:12.290> don't<00:04:12.319> really<00:04:12.680> know<00:04:12.799> how<00:04:13.069> that's

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:13.280

gameplay<00:04:15.409> for<00:04:15.530> that<00:04:15.680> and<00:04:15.970> since<00:04:16.970> quickscoping

00:04:17.439 --> 00:04:17.449 
gameplay for that and since quickscoping

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:20.080 
gameplay for that and since quickscoping
back<00:04:17.750> I<00:04:17.989> think<00:04:18.500> there's<00:04:18.680> like<00:04:18.709> the<00:04:19.010> L<00:04:19.190> 911<00:04:19.940> or

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:20.090 
back I think there's like the L 911 or

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:21.969 
back I think there's like the L 911 or
whatever<00:04:20.299> pretty<00:04:20.659> much<00:04:20.810> what<00:04:21.380> that<00:04:21.500> is<00:04:21.680> is<00:04:21.829> the

00:04:21.969 --> 00:04:21.979 
whatever pretty much what that is is the

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:24.219 
whatever pretty much what that is is the
l<00:04:22.099> 96<00:04:22.460> from<00:04:22.820> black<00:04:23.030> ops<00:04:23.300> and<00:04:23.840> yeah<00:04:23.990> i'm<00:04:24.080> gonna

00:04:24.219 --> 00:04:24.229 
l 96 from black ops and yeah i'm gonna

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:25.839
