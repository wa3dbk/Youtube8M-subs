I<00:01:03.230> did<00:01:03.530> this<00:01:03.710> the<00:01:04.400> first<00:01:04.640> element<00:01:05.119> of<00:01:05.269> this

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:05.720 
I did this the first element of this

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:07.660 
I did this the first element of this
particular<00:01:06.259> sculpture<00:01:06.590> that<00:01:06.920> was<00:01:07.220> created

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:07.670 
particular sculpture that was created

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:10.480 
particular sculpture that was created
was<00:01:07.880> obviously<00:01:08.479> the<00:01:08.689> hand<00:01:08.990> the<00:01:09.950> hand<00:01:10.100> was<00:01:10.310> made

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:10.490 
was obviously the hand the hand was made

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:13.649 
was obviously the hand the hand was made
out<00:01:10.520> of<00:01:10.790> a<00:01:10.939> rebar<00:01:11.680> framework<00:01:12.680> and<00:01:13.009> then

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:13.659 
out of a rebar framework and then

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:17.609 
out of a rebar framework and then
covered<00:01:14.659> with<00:01:14.840> 16<00:01:15.320> gauge<00:01:15.590> steel<00:01:16.090> sheet<00:01:17.090> steel

00:01:17.609 --> 00:01:17.619 
covered with 16 gauge steel sheet steel

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:20.859 
covered with 16 gauge steel sheet steel
to<00:01:18.619> make<00:01:19.009> the<00:01:19.190> additional<00:01:19.640> flat<00:01:20.270> portions<00:01:20.720> of

00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:20.869 
to make the additional flat portions of

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:25.749 
to make the additional flat portions of
the<00:01:20.990> hand<00:01:21.880> then<00:01:22.880> the<00:01:23.560> the<00:01:24.560> between<00:01:25.549> the

00:01:25.749 --> 00:01:25.759 
the hand then the the between the

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:28.240 
the hand then the the between the
fingers<00:01:26.090> and<00:01:26.119> the<00:01:26.479> palm<00:01:26.509> was<00:01:27.380> also<00:01:27.710> built<00:01:27.950> up

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:28.250 
fingers and the palm was also built up

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:31.930 
fingers and the palm was also built up
using<00:01:29.090> a<00:01:29.450> process<00:01:29.750> of<00:01:30.259> layering<00:01:30.740> with<00:01:31.399> welding

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:31.940 
using a process of layering with welding

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:34.540 
using a process of layering with welding
material<00:01:32.090> welding<00:01:32.720> rod<00:01:32.979> and<00:01:33.979> using<00:01:34.429> the

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:34.550 
material welding rod and using the

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:37.840 
material welding rod and using the
oxygen<00:01:34.789> acetylene<00:01:35.440> system<00:01:36.440> after<00:01:37.369> that<00:01:37.729> was

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:37.850 
oxygen acetylene system after that was

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:39.490 
oxygen acetylene system after that was
accomplished<00:01:38.390> it<00:01:38.479> was<00:01:38.600> all<00:01:38.750> flowed<00:01:39.170> together

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:39.500 
accomplished it was all flowed together

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.399 
accomplished it was all flowed together
in<00:01:40.159> a<00:01:40.550> molten<00:01:40.789> State<00:01:41.210> to<00:01:41.479> cause<00:01:41.690> the<00:01:42.020> wrinkles

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:42.409 
in a molten State to cause the wrinkles

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:43.809 
in a molten State to cause the wrinkles
to<00:01:42.470> come<00:01:42.710> out<00:01:42.860> of<00:01:42.979> it<00:01:43.100> to<00:01:43.280> have<00:01:43.369> it<00:01:43.490> look<00:01:43.670> more

00:01:43.809 --> 00:01:43.819 
to come out of it to have it look more

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:46.450 
to come out of it to have it look more
natural<00:01:44.229> and<00:01:45.229> then<00:01:45.590> the<00:01:45.679> hand<00:01:45.890> was<00:01:46.069> basically

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:46.460 
natural and then the hand was basically

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:49.480 
natural and then the hand was basically
complete<00:01:46.940> once<00:01:47.179> that<00:01:47.420> was<00:01:47.600> done<00:01:47.860> then<00:01:48.860> the

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:49.490 
complete once that was done then the

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:51.460 
complete once that was done then the
structure<00:01:50.060> of<00:01:50.209> the<00:01:50.299> architectural<00:01:51.080> structure

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:51.470 
structure of the architectural structure

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:53.410 
structure of the architectural structure
needed<00:01:51.770> to<00:01:51.860> be<00:01:52.009> created<00:01:52.490> which<00:01:53.149> was<00:01:53.360> a

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:53.420 
needed to be created which was a

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.230 
needed to be created which was a
framework<00:01:53.810> covered<00:01:54.560> by<00:01:54.679> 16<00:01:55.250> gauge<00:01:55.580> sheet

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.240 
framework covered by 16 gauge sheet

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.199 
framework covered by 16 gauge sheet
steel<00:01:56.479> as<00:01:56.810> well<00:01:57.130> it<00:01:58.130> didn't<00:01:58.399> require<00:01:58.610> any<00:01:58.670> flow

00:01:59.199 --> 00:01:59.209 
steel as well it didn't require any flow

00:01:59.209 --> 00:02:02.889 
steel as well it didn't require any flow
work<00:01:59.569> with<00:02:00.350> the<00:02:00.530> the<00:02:01.520> torch<00:02:01.789> because<00:02:02.330> it<00:02:02.780> was

00:02:02.889 --> 00:02:02.899 
work with the the torch because it was

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:04.510 
work with the the torch because it was
already<00:02:03.050> flattened<00:02:03.530> as<00:02:03.649> to<00:02:03.800> the<00:02:03.890> intent<00:02:04.340> there

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:04.520 
already flattened as to the intent there

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.540 
already flattened as to the intent there
was<00:02:05.149> to<00:02:05.479> have<00:02:05.629> it<00:02:05.780> have<00:02:05.989> flat<00:02:06.289> side<00:02:06.590> so<00:02:07.069> that

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:07.550 
was to have it have flat side so that

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:09.669 
was to have it have flat side so that
wasn't<00:02:07.819> required<00:02:07.940> just<00:02:08.450> quite<00:02:09.140> a<00:02:09.170> bit<00:02:09.349> of<00:02:09.470> MIG

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:09.679 
wasn't required just quite a bit of MIG

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:12.190 
wasn't required just quite a bit of MIG
welding<00:02:10.129> to<00:02:10.369> tack<00:02:11.000> it<00:02:11.180> together<00:02:11.300> and<00:02:11.690> then

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
welding to tack it together and then

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.949 
welding to tack it together and then
well<00:02:12.560> the<00:02:12.739> seams<00:02:13.040> shut<00:02:13.459> and<00:02:13.760> in<00:02:14.360> the<00:02:14.450> last<00:02:14.660> one

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:14.959 
well the seams shut and in the last one

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:17.470 
well the seams shut and in the last one
final<00:02:15.349> stage<00:02:15.650> was<00:02:16.040> the<00:02:16.069> refining<00:02:16.790> process<00:02:17.239> has

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
final stage was the refining process has

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.990 
final stage was the refining process has
my<00:02:17.629> wife<00:02:17.750> likes<00:02:18.080> to<00:02:18.230> call<00:02:18.410> it<00:02:18.580> which<00:02:19.580> was<00:02:19.819> the

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
my wife likes to call it which was the

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.240 
my wife likes to call it which was the
grinding<00:02:20.480> once<00:02:21.140> the<00:02:21.290> grinding<00:02:21.680> was<00:02:21.830> done<00:02:22.010> in

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
grinding once the grinding was done in

I<00:02:25.610> am<00:02:26.000> going<00:02:26.209> to<00:02:26.300> put<00:02:26.629> a<00:02:26.830> what<00:02:27.830> looks<00:02:28.010> to<00:02:28.190> be<00:02:28.310> a

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
I am going to put a what looks to be a

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:31.600 
I am going to put a what looks to be a
flesh<00:02:28.849> patina<00:02:29.360> of<00:02:29.480> rust<00:02:29.930> on<00:02:30.170> it<00:02:30.489> through<00:02:31.489> an

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
flesh patina of rust on it through an

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:34.240 
flesh patina of rust on it through an
accelerated<00:02:32.300> process<00:02:32.870> of<00:02:33.050> chemicals<00:02:33.500> which

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
accelerated process of chemicals which

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:36.880 
accelerated process of chemicals which
should<00:02:34.459> only<00:02:34.580> take<00:02:34.840> 2<00:02:35.840> or<00:02:35.870> 3<00:02:35.959> hours<00:02:36.110> and<00:02:36.650> and

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
should only take 2 or 3 hours and and

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:38.500 
should only take 2 or 3 hours and and
once<00:02:37.099> that<00:02:37.280> done<00:02:37.489> I'll<00:02:37.700> spray<00:02:38.000> it<00:02:38.030> with<00:02:38.209> clear

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
once that done I'll spray it with clear

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.449 
once that done I'll spray it with clear
lacquer<00:02:38.750> and<00:02:39.110> that<00:02:39.890> will<00:02:40.040> complete<00:02:40.430> the

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:40.459 
lacquer and that will complete the

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:43.059 
lacquer and that will complete the
entire<00:02:40.879> process<00:02:41.180> so<00:02:41.690> hope<00:02:42.590> you've<00:02:42.769> enjoyed
