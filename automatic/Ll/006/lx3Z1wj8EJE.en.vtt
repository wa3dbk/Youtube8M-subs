00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:10.180 

to<00:00:03.830> make<00:00:03.980> the<00:00:04.130> ears<00:00:04.310> take<00:00:05.319> two<00:00:06.319> pieces<00:00:08.950> put<00:00:09.950> one

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:10.190 
to make the ears take two pieces put one

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:12.909 
to make the ears take two pieces put one
piece<00:00:10.400> in<00:00:10.700> the<00:00:10.940> middle<00:00:11.169> put<00:00:12.169> two<00:00:12.349> pieces<00:00:12.589> on

00:00:12.909 --> 00:00:12.919 
piece in the middle put two pieces on

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:15.310 
piece in the middle put two pieces on
top<00:00:13.099> of<00:00:13.249> that<00:00:13.429> so<00:00:13.849> this<00:00:14.240> piece<00:00:14.570> goes<00:00:14.599> over<00:00:15.200> this

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:15.320 
top of that so this piece goes over this

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:21.590 
top of that so this piece goes over this
point<00:00:15.650> and<00:00:15.829> this<00:00:16.100> point

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.030 

and<00:00:22.050> then<00:00:22.350> one<00:00:22.590> piece<00:00:22.770> on<00:00:23.010> top<00:00:24.380> now<00:00:25.380> from<00:00:25.740> these

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:26.040 
and then one piece on top now from these

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:30.710 
and then one piece on top now from these
pieces<00:00:26.400> count<00:00:27.090> one<00:00:27.390> two<00:00:27.710> three<00:00:28.710> pieces<00:00:29.720> then

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
pieces count one two three pieces then

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.420 
pieces count one two three pieces then
on<00:00:30.900> the<00:00:31.050> piece<00:00:31.230> next<00:00:31.619> to<00:00:31.710> that<00:00:31.860> the<00:00:32.190> air<00:00:32.400> is

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
on the piece next to that the air is

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.390 
on the piece next to that the air is
going<00:00:32.790> to<00:00:32.880> go<00:00:33.030> on<00:00:33.080> this<00:00:34.080> point<00:00:34.470> and<00:00:34.680> in<00:00:35.100> the

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:35.400 
going to go on this point and in the

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.690 
going to go on this point and in the
point<00:00:35.640> of<00:00:35.760> the<00:00:36.000> next<00:00:36.239> piece<00:00:37.129> so<00:00:38.129> make<00:00:38.400> the<00:00:38.550> air

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
point of the next piece so make the air

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:45.530 
point of the next piece so make the air
and<00:00:38.940> vert<00:00:39.239> it<00:00:43.670> so<00:00:44.670> the<00:00:44.850> straight<00:00:45.150> side<00:00:45.360> is

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:45.540 
and vert it so the straight side is

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:49.490 
and vert it so the straight side is
facing<00:00:45.750> out<00:00:47.270> and<00:00:48.270> then<00:00:48.840> between<00:00:49.140> the<00:00:49.350> ears

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
facing out and then between the ears

00:00:49.500 --> 00:01:01.460 
facing out and then between the ears
will<00:00:49.830> just<00:00:50.040> be<00:00:50.220> two<00:00:50.430> points<00:00:59.989> so<00:01:00.989> it<00:01:01.019> should<00:01:01.440> be

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:01.470 
will just be two points so it should be

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:08.990 
will just be two points so it should be
equal<00:01:02.040> for<00:01:05.780> the<00:01:06.780> legs<00:01:07.460> take<00:01:08.460> a<00:01:08.490> white<00:01:08.760> piece
