00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
don't really accept mocking and there's

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.340 
don't really accept mocking and there's
some<00:00:45.030> bling<00:00:46.309> no<00:00:47.309> one<00:00:47.460> is<00:00:47.610> spitting<00:00:48.180> up<00:00:48.360> as<00:00:49.050> far

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
as I know no it's something very

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.549 
as I know no it's something very
different<00:00:53.969> in<00:00:54.480> high<00:00:54.660> school<00:00:54.930> them<00:00:55.110> ugh<00:00:55.289> it's

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
different in high school them ugh it's

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.910

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
parties so of course there is a social

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.570 
parties so of course there is a social
pressure<00:01:02.190> to<00:01:02.399> be<00:01:03.180> cool<00:01:03.539> and<00:01:03.860> all<00:01:04.860> that<00:01:05.309> but

totally<00:05:21.580> they<00:05:21.759> actually<00:05:22.300> just<00:05:22.330> used<00:05:22.810> me<00:05:23.050> as<00:05:23.139> a

00:05:23.159 --> 00:05:23.169 
totally they actually just used me as a

00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:26.279 
totally they actually just used me as a
LGBT<00:05:24.009> book<00:05:24.580> so<00:05:25.419> if<00:05:25.539> they<00:05:25.690> had<00:05:25.870> any<00:05:26.169> questions

00:05:26.279 --> 00:05:26.289 
LGBT book so if they had any questions

00:05:26.289 --> 00:05:29.879 
LGBT book so if they had any questions
about<00:05:26.830> how<00:05:27.310> it<00:05:27.789> is<00:05:28.120> to<00:05:28.270> be<00:05:28.300> gay<00:05:28.870> the<00:05:29.229> company
