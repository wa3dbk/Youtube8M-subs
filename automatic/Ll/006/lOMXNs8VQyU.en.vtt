00:03:03.399 --> 00:03:03.409 
of without like hundreds and thousands

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:05.920 
of without like hundreds and thousands
of<00:03:03.530> parts<00:03:03.799> things<00:03:04.610> like<00:03:04.760> this<00:03:04.940> you<00:03:05.330> cannot<00:03:05.750> do

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:08.209 
it with the ps3 right it's using ps4s

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:11.949 
it with the ps3 right it's using ps4s
processing<00:03:08.959> power<00:03:09.170> to<00:03:09.940> draw<00:03:10.940> all<00:03:11.750> these

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:11.959 
processing power to draw all these

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:15.369 
processing power to draw all these
little<00:03:12.170> details<00:03:13.000> here<00:03:14.000> you<00:03:14.330> are<00:03:14.569> stealth<00:03:15.140> neck

secret rooms like that there's more than
60<00:03:48.440> of<00:03:48.530> them<00:03:48.650> in<00:03:48.859> the<00:03:49.010> game<00:03:51.310> in<00:03:52.310> terms<00:03:52.909> of<00:03:53.560> the

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:54.560 
60 of them in the game in terms of the

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:56.289 
60 of them in the game in terms of the
number<00:03:54.829> of<00:03:54.859> gadgets<00:03:55.340> that<00:03:55.609> you'll<00:03:55.940> be<00:03:56.060> able<00:03:56.090> to

00:03:56.289 --> 00:03:56.299 
number of gadgets that you'll be able to

00:03:56.299 --> 00:03:58.050 
number of gadgets that you'll be able to
collect<00:03:56.540> in<00:03:56.659> the<00:03:56.750> game<00:03:56.900> it<00:03:57.319> is<00:03:57.470> still<00:03:57.709> unknown

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:58.060 
collect in the game it is still unknown

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:10.250 
collect in the game it is still unknown
we<00:03:59.060> are<00:03:59.209> still<00:03:59.569> building<00:04:00.079> them<00:04:00.379> as<00:04:00.560> we<00:04:00.709> speak

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:10.260 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:14.059 

so<00:04:10.830> this<00:04:11.099> is<00:04:11.220> one<00:04:11.370> of<00:04:11.400> the<00:04:12.590> unique<00:04:13.590> levels<00:04:13.950> in

00:04:14.059 --> 00:04:14.069 
so this is one of the unique levels in

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:16.250 
so this is one of the unique levels in
this<00:04:14.159> game<00:04:14.250> as<00:04:14.519> well<00:04:14.700> it's<00:04:14.939> um<00:04:15.239> it's<00:04:15.810> slippery

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:16.260 
this game as well it's um it's slippery

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.530 
this game as well it's um it's slippery
it's<00:04:16.470> a<00:04:16.530> slippery<00:04:16.829> level<00:04:17.190> as<00:04:17.310> you<00:04:17.340> can<00:04:17.579> see<00:04:17.729> and

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:18.540 
it's a slippery level as you can see and

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:20.539 
it's a slippery level as you can see and
you're<00:04:18.690> also<00:04:18.840> considered<00:04:19.769> by<00:04:19.889> ice<00:04:20.130> parts

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:20.549 
you're also considered by ice parts

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:23.510 
you're also considered by ice parts
which<00:04:21.449> means<00:04:21.720> when<00:04:22.590> you<00:04:22.680> walk<00:04:22.860> outside<00:04:23.280> with

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:23.520 
which means when you walk outside with

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:26.240 
which means when you walk outside with
with<00:04:23.880> this<00:04:24.380> with<00:04:25.380> these<00:04:25.530> parts<00:04:25.860> you'll<00:04:26.010> start

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:26.250 
with this with these parts you'll start

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:27.680 
with this with these parts you'll start
melting<00:04:26.430> and<00:04:26.850> you'll<00:04:26.970> start<00:04:27.120> transforming

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:27.690 
melting and you'll start transforming

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:36.900 
melting and you'll start transforming
sizes

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:36.910 

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:39.000 

again<00:04:37.540> we<00:04:37.690> have<00:04:37.840> a<00:04:37.870> unique<00:04:38.200> surface<00:04:38.710> where

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:39.010 
again we have a unique surface where

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:42.750 
again we have a unique surface where
it's<00:04:39.280> hard<00:04:39.490> to<00:04:39.580> walk<00:04:40.710> we've<00:04:41.710> created<00:04:41.980> various

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:42.760 
it's hard to walk we've created various

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:44.370 
it's hard to walk we've created various
levels<00:04:43.090> in<00:04:43.390> the<00:04:43.480> game<00:04:43.510> like<00:04:43.810> this<00:04:43.960> where

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:44.380 
levels in the game like this where

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:46.530 
levels in the game like this where
you'll<00:04:44.530> be<00:04:44.770> able<00:04:45.520> to<00:04:45.730> experience<00:04:46.300> different

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:46.540 
you'll be able to experience different

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:54.210 
you'll be able to experience different
physics<00:04:47.080> when<00:04:47.980> you<00:04:48.070> move<00:04:48.220> around<00:04:52.950> so<00:04:53.950> again

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:54.220 
physics when you move around so again

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:59.040 
physics when you move around so again
this<00:04:55.950> neck<00:04:56.950> is<00:04:57.280> a<00:04:57.310> character<00:04:58.120> based<00:04:58.300> action
