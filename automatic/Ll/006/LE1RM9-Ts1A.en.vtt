00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:18.740
 I want to introduce you to one of 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:20.880
 representatives of the line tit sram 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:29.689

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:43.129
 long wondered what model 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:46.579
 still decided to buy this 

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:51.719
 for me it is uncompromising 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:52.949
 for the simple reason that her test is from 0 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:59.030
 up to 2 and a half grams 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:01:02.239
 declared I was interested in working weights 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:07.170
 from bulk 3 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:10.680
 at conferences it is believed that this spin 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:14.070
 can freely overload up to three s 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:16.610
 half a gram he does not lose his 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:20.340
 qualities during animation 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:27.380

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.299

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:51.439
 In my opinion a very high quality case 

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:04.920
 two separate compartments beautifully written 

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:04.920
 logo and silver paint 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:23.049

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:23.620
 that this product has the original 

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:27.420

 more than 7000 tag produced 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:53.840

 katushkoderzhatel new site said 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:29.120
 what plastics applied 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:33.549
 especially for its manufacture 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:40.420
 transmits tactile sensation in hand 

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:40.420
 interesting front-shaped fishing rod 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:50.060
 written that it is 6 feet long 10 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:54.860

 preferably mono fishing line from 0 8 d 3 b 

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:10.180
 but in the explanations to the Ukrainian market 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:19.039
 it is possible to use this rod with 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:27.889
 cords 0203 Japanese classification 

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:32.660
 I personally bought 0 3 brew layers game in 

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:39.880
 unwinding 150 meters which I plan 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:39.880
 use when catching on this spin 

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:50.830
 vertex is in a separate section 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:55.690

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:15.730
 by material 

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:19.090
 very thin tail diameter of the bush 

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:19.090

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:38.180
 fuji 1 paw titanium rings 

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:59.690

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:22.860

 rods directly on fishing 

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:33.550

00:06:48.009 --> 00:06:56.289
 not very much online 

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:59.440
 I collected it myself as if not bit by bit 

00:06:56.289 --> 00:07:02.669
 all have the opportunity to trot in your hands 

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:07.860
 many people buy in absentia before buying 

00:07:02.669 --> 00:07:07.860
 so I decided to post this video 

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:13.050
