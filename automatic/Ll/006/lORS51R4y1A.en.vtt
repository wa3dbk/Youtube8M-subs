00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:17.540 
we're going up against the hypercar and

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:21.009 
we're going up against the hypercar and
this<00:03:17.840> thing<00:03:18.850> it<00:03:19.850> does<00:03:20.030> have<00:03:20.180> the<00:03:20.299> top<00:03:20.510> speed<00:03:20.780> it

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:22.870 
this thing it does have the top speed it
will<00:03:21.110> compete<00:03:21.410> against<00:03:21.650> this<00:03:21.739> thing<00:03:21.950> but<00:03:22.670> it

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:22.880 
will compete against this thing but it

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:24.100 
will compete against this thing but it
looks<00:03:23.090> like<00:03:23.269> we're<00:03:23.420> doing<00:03:23.540> pretty<00:03:23.780> good<00:03:23.900> job

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:24.110

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
so far I mean happy mods really doesn't

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:28.420 
so far I mean happy mods really doesn't
really<00:03:26.930> does<00:03:27.110> help<00:03:27.350> especially<00:03:27.799> if<00:03:28.130> you're

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:28.430 
really does help especially if you're

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:30.580 
really does help especially if you're
going<00:03:28.730> up<00:03:28.850> against<00:03:29.299> a<00:03:29.390> car<00:03:29.569> that's<00:03:29.870> not<00:03:30.140> really

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:30.590 
going up against a car that's not really

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:35.680 
going up against a car that's not really
as<00:03:31.100> fast<00:03:31.640> as<00:03:31.850> a<00:03:31.880> Bugatti<00:03:32.239> so<00:03:32.810> yeah<00:03:33.820> also<00:03:34.820> I<00:03:35.359> just

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:35.690 
as fast as a Bugatti so yeah also I just

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:37.930 
as fast as a Bugatti so yeah also I just
saw<00:03:35.810> break<00:03:36.019> I<00:03:36.140> just<00:03:36.260> don't<00:03:36.380> recommend<00:03:36.799> using<00:03:37.040> I

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:37.940 
saw break I just don't recommend using I

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:41.199 
saw break I just don't recommend using I
don't<00:03:38.420> know<00:03:38.660> like<00:03:39.190> you<00:03:40.190> know<00:03:40.220> in<00:03:40.700> Ariel<00:03:41.030> Atom

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:41.209 
don't know like you know in Ariel Atom

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:43.660 
don't know like you know in Ariel Atom
because<00:03:41.660> the<00:03:42.170> Bugatti<00:03:42.500> Veyron<00:03:42.890> is<00:03:42.920> fast<00:03:43.310> but

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:43.670 
because the Bugatti Veyron is fast but

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:45.280 
because the Bugatti Veyron is fast but
it<00:03:44.000> doesn't<00:03:44.299> have<00:03:44.390> a<00:03:44.450> top<00:03:44.600> student<00:03:44.810> or<00:03:45.140> so

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:45.290 
it doesn't have a top student or so

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:47.410 
it doesn't have a top student or so
that's<00:03:45.440> why<00:03:45.709> I'm<00:03:46.310> using<00:03:46.400> like<00:03:46.730> most<00:03:46.970> more<00:03:47.150> cars

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:47.420 
that's why I'm using like most more cars

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:49.180 
that's why I'm using like most more cars
to<00:03:47.540> go<00:03:47.660> up<00:03:47.780> against<00:03:48.170> them<00:03:48.350> because<00:03:48.920> they<00:03:49.070> have

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:49.190 
to go up against them because they have

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:51.040 
to go up against them because they have
the<00:03:49.370> proper<00:03:49.790> mods

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:51.050 
the proper mods

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:53.440 
the proper mods
so<00:03:51.680> yeah<00:03:52.430> that<00:03:52.640> we've<00:03:52.790> got<00:03:52.970> in<00:03:53.120> that<00:03:53.210> probably

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:53.450 
so yeah that we've got in that probably

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:54.880 
so yeah that we've got in that probably
lost<00:03:53.690> control<00:03:54.020> over<00:03:54.140> there<00:03:54.410> because<00:03:54.710> we've

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:54.890 
lost control over there because we've

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:57.160 
lost control over there because we've
got<00:03:55.070> a<00:03:55.150> as<00:03:56.150> far<00:03:56.390> as<00:03:56.510> I'm<00:03:56.630> concerned<00:03:56.900> doesn't

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:57.170 
got a as far as I'm concerned doesn't

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:59.470 
got a as far as I'm concerned doesn't
have<00:03:57.260> a<00:03:57.290> lot<00:03:57.530> of<00:03:57.560> control<00:03:58.130> over<00:03:58.520> the<00:03:58.910> actual

00:03:59.470 --> 00:03:59.480 
have a lot of control over the actual

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:02.980 
have a lot of control over the actual
you<00:04:00.410> know<00:04:00.440> carbs<00:04:01.070> so<00:04:01.370> yeah<00:04:02.120> but<00:04:02.390> it's<00:04:02.840> pretty

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:02.990 
you know carbs so yeah but it's pretty

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:04.870 
you know carbs so yeah but it's pretty
fast<00:04:03.350> so<00:04:03.560> I<00:04:03.680> think<00:04:03.800> the<00:04:04.220> lack<00:04:04.400> of<00:04:04.550> control

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:04.880 
fast so I think the lack of control

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:08.110 
fast so I think the lack of control
really<00:04:05.330> uh<00:04:05.360> I<00:04:05.870> guess<00:04:06.620> it<00:04:06.860> it's<00:04:07.730> a<00:04:07.880> fair<00:04:08.090> trade

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:08.120 
really uh I guess it it's a fair trade

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:10.030 
really uh I guess it it's a fair trade
out<00:04:08.570> again<00:04:08.840> I<00:04:08.960> guess<00:04:09.140> I<00:04:09.290> could<00:04:09.440> say<00:04:09.620> but<00:04:09.890> then

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:10.040 
out again I guess I could say but then

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:12.130 
out again I guess I could say but then
