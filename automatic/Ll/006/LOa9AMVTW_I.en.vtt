texture the brightest shape okay so if I

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.439 
texture the brightest shape okay so if I
just<00:00:18.210> stand<00:00:18.710> say<00:00:19.730> you<00:00:20.730> know<00:00:20.820> at<00:00:21.090> where<00:00:21.300> your

bushy tree that's hanging over and some
columns<00:00:29.730> of<00:00:29.970> trees<00:00:30.270> and<00:00:30.930> then<00:00:31.109> and<00:00:31.580> all<00:00:32.580> the

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
columns of trees and then and all the

foliage also always try to have a little
piece<00:00:36.210> of<00:00:36.239> sky<00:00:36.660> in<00:00:37.140> the<00:00:37.470> picture<00:00:37.890> and<00:00:38.430> it<00:00:38.579> just

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
piece of sky in the picture and it just

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.610 
piece of sky in the picture and it just
helps<00:00:39.030> open<00:00:39.270> the<00:00:39.480> space<00:00:39.809> up<00:00:39.870> a<00:00:40.260> little<00:00:40.440> bit

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
helps open the space up a little bit

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.940 
helps open the space up a little bit
more<00:00:40.829> if<00:00:41.520> you<00:00:41.640> don't<00:00:41.820> have<00:00:41.970> sky<00:00:42.239> sometimes<00:00:42.950> you

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
more if you don't have sky sometimes you

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.100 
more if you don't have sky sometimes you
lose<00:00:44.370> a<00:00:44.430> sense<00:00:44.760> of<00:00:44.940> light<00:00:45.210> and<00:00:45.510> your<00:00:45.750> picture

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
lose a sense of light and your picture

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.100 
lose a sense of light and your picture
can<00:00:46.649> become<00:00:46.920> a<00:00:46.950> little<00:00:47.100> too<00:00:47.399> dark<00:00:47.930> others<00:00:48.930> in

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:02.700 
titanium white so remember there's no

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:07.969 
titanium white so remember there's no
greens<00:01:03.090> when<00:01:03.480> big<00:01:03.630> solid<00:01:06.860> especially<00:01:07.860> because

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
greens when big solid especially because

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.370 
greens when big solid especially because
we're<00:01:08.220> surrounded<00:01:08.490> by<00:01:08.670> all<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:09.000> green<00:01:09.390> I<00:01:09.840> said

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
we're surrounded by all the green I said

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.900 
we're surrounded by all the green I said
you<00:01:10.470> want<00:01:10.710> to<00:01:10.860> think<00:01:11.100> of<00:01:11.250> your<00:01:11.490> greens<00:01:11.910> as<00:01:13.100> as<00:01:14.100> a

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:14.910 
you want to think of your greens as as a

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:17.930 
you want to think of your greens as as a
mixture<00:01:15.420> earth<00:01:15.990> is<00:01:16.350> not<00:01:16.830> as<00:01:17.010> clean<00:01:17.310> but<00:01:17.700> it's<00:01:17.850> a

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:17.940 
mixture earth is not as clean but it's a

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:20.750 
mixture earth is not as clean but it's a
variation<00:01:18.180> of<00:01:18.479> yellow<00:01:19.369> remember<00:01:20.369> me<00:01:20.490> saying

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:20.760 
variation of yellow remember me saying

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.510 
variation of yellow remember me saying
that<00:01:21.020> and<00:01:22.020> I<00:01:22.050> think<00:01:22.260> when<00:01:22.380> you<00:01:22.470> do<00:01:22.680> that<00:01:22.860> you

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
that and I think when you do that you

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.290 
that and I think when you do that you
can<00:01:23.640> develop<00:01:23.880> a<00:01:24.060> lot<00:01:24.210> more<00:01:24.360> complexity<00:01:26.300> so

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:27.300 
can develop a lot more complexity so

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:28.580 
can develop a lot more complexity so
right<00:01:27.450> now<00:01:27.570> I'm<00:01:27.690> just<00:01:27.840> I'm<00:01:28.050> kind<00:01:28.320> of<00:01:28.380> figure

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
right now I'm just I'm kind of figure

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.410 
right now I'm just I'm kind of figure
out<00:01:28.619> the<00:01:28.710> place<00:01:28.979> for<00:01:29.190> this<00:01:29.310> tree<00:01:29.610> and<00:01:30.000> I'm<00:01:30.300> just

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
out the place for this tree and I'm just

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.480 
out the place for this tree and I'm just
you<00:01:31.140> know<00:01:31.229> this<00:01:31.350> is<00:01:31.410> very<00:01:31.470> gestural<00:01:32.160> this<00:01:32.310> kind

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
you know this is very gestural this kind

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.190 
you know this is very gestural this kind
of<00:01:32.520> sketching<00:01:32.940> and<00:01:33.240> it's<00:01:33.690> water

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
of sketching and it's water

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.980 
of sketching and it's water
bank<00:01:34.860> and<00:01:35.190> I<00:01:36.149> might<00:01:36.360> adjust<00:01:36.479> the<00:01:36.810> proportions

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
bank and I might adjust the proportions

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:47.649 
bank and I might adjust the proportions
out<00:01:37.530> a<00:01:37.590> little<00:01:37.770> bit<00:01:39.380> okay<00:01:40.380> let's<00:01:40.740> go

ahead<00:04:33.660> and<00:04:33.870> put<00:04:34.020> the<00:04:34.140> water<00:04:34.380> and<00:04:34.770> just<00:04:36.710> see<00:04:37.710> how

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:37.830 
ahead and put the water and just see how

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:39.830 
ahead and put the water and just see how
these<00:04:37.980> colors<00:04:38.460> are<00:04:38.670> working<00:04:39.060> together<00:04:39.180> this

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:39.840 
these colors are working together this

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:42.830 
these colors are working together this
is<00:04:40.080> very<00:04:40.320> warm<00:04:40.620> and<00:04:41.010> this<00:04:41.130> is<00:04:41.340> very<00:04:41.520> cool<00:04:41.850> so<00:04:42.780> I

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:42.840 
is very warm and this is very cool so I

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:44.000 
is very warm and this is very cool so I
need<00:04:42.990> to<00:04:43.050> try<00:04:43.170> to<00:04:43.230> figure<00:04:43.440> out<00:04:43.590> how<00:04:43.740> to<00:04:43.770> balance

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:44.010 
need to try to figure out how to balance

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:46.880 
need to try to figure out how to balance
that<00:04:44.400> and<00:04:44.640> so<00:04:45.300> this<00:04:45.480> is<00:04:45.660> that's<00:04:46.440> one<00:04:46.680> that's

00:05:03.969 --> 00:05:24.980 
go lower the intensity of that a little
bit<00:05:04.150> or<00:05:04.300> also<00:05:04.419> will<00:05:04.659> they'll<00:05:05.259> pop<00:05:05.620> rabbit
