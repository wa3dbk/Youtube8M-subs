00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.219 
something like that I'm going to show
you<00:01:20.090> which<00:01:21.090> is<00:01:21.299> something<00:01:21.509> that<00:01:21.659> I<00:01:21.990> don't

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
you which is something that I don't

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.560 
you which is something that I don't
think<00:01:22.470> it's<00:01:22.590> in<00:01:22.710> the<00:01:22.740> gallery<00:01:23.159> yet<00:01:23.400> how<00:01:24.030> to<00:01:24.090> use

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
think it's in the gallery yet how to use

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.130 
think it's in the gallery yet how to use
parts<00:01:25.140> that<00:01:25.710> you<00:01:25.890> clean<00:01:26.430> up<00:01:26.580> in<00:01:26.790> Photoshop<00:01:27.140> so

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
parts that you clean up in Photoshop so

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.859 
parts that you clean up in Photoshop so
you<00:01:28.200> can<00:01:28.530> combine<00:01:28.770> your<00:01:29.000> pixels<00:01:30.000> and<00:01:30.240> then

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
you can combine your pixels and then

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.990 
you can combine your pixels and then
another<00:01:31.259> thing<00:01:31.500> that<00:01:31.560> I<00:01:31.740> found<00:01:32.159> was<00:01:32.400> kind<00:01:32.670> of<00:01:32.790> a

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
another thing that I found was kind of a

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.350 
another thing that I found was kind of a
little<00:01:33.240> bit<00:01:33.329> more<00:01:33.479> complicated<00:01:34.409> is<00:01:34.890> to

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:35.360 
little bit more complicated is to

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:38.240 
little bit more complicated is to
incorporate<00:01:36.360> our<00:01:36.810> new<00:01:37.049> brushes<00:01:37.409> that<00:01:37.860> we<00:01:38.009> have

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
incorporate our new brushes that we have

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.399 
incorporate our new brushes that we have
which<00:01:38.579> are<00:01:38.790> the<00:01:38.939> watercolor<00:01:39.479> bristle<00:01:40.140> brushes

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
which are the watercolor bristle brushes

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.600 
which are the watercolor bristle brushes
that<00:01:40.829> we<00:01:41.040> can<00:01:41.280> use<00:01:41.490> in<00:01:41.820> cs5<00:01:42.720> and<00:01:43.259> then<00:01:43.950> just<00:01:44.490> to

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
that we can use in cs5 and then just to

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.999 
that we can use in cs5 and then just to
make<00:01:44.759> sure<00:01:44.790> that<00:01:45.060> you<00:01:45.329> kind<00:01:46.229> of<00:01:46.380> get<00:01:46.829> the

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
make sure that you kind of get the

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.340 
make sure that you kind of get the
courage<00:01:47.369> to<00:01:47.549> look<00:01:48.210> over<00:01:48.540> the<00:01:48.659> instructions

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
courage to look over the instructions

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.350 
courage to look over the instructions
and<00:01:49.530> follow<00:01:49.740> them<00:01:50.130> you<00:01:50.640> can<00:01:50.820> have<00:01:50.909> the<00:01:51.030> easiest

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
and follow them you can have the easiest

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.330 
and follow them you can have the easiest
way<00:01:51.600> of<00:01:51.630> doing<00:01:52.110> that<00:01:52.320> because<00:01:53.009> these

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
way of doing that because these

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.190 
way of doing that because these
instructions<00:01:53.880> do<00:01:54.119> come<00:01:54.450> with<00:01:54.750> the<00:01:55.020> map

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
instructions do come with the map

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.620 
instructions do come with the map
patterns<00:01:55.590> but<00:01:55.890> if<00:01:56.070> you're<00:01:56.549> fairly<00:01:57.270> new<00:01:57.420> to

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
patterns but if you're fairly new to

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.240 
patterns but if you're fairly new to
illustrator<00:01:57.750> this<00:01:58.290> might<00:01:58.500> still<00:01:58.770> be<00:01:58.890> hard<00:01:59.040> and

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
illustrator this might still be hard and

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.160 
illustrator this might still be hard and
I<00:01:59.340> would<00:01:59.850> love<00:02:00.149> for<00:02:00.180> you<00:02:00.420> to<00:02:00.450> have<00:02:00.689> fun<00:02:00.869> and<00:02:00.930> try

this out okay so let's look at some of
the<00:02:04.710> things<00:02:04.950> that<00:02:05.130> you<00:02:05.250> can<00:02:05.460> do<00:02:05.579> so<00:02:06.000> first<00:02:06.270> of

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
the things that you can do so first of

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.029 
the things that you can do so first of
all<00:02:06.540> you<00:02:06.780> would<00:02:06.960> go<00:02:07.110> into<00:02:07.350> your<00:02:07.649> current

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
all you would go into your current

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.369 
all you would go into your current
illustrator<00:02:08.520> and<00:02:08.700> go<00:02:08.849> to<00:02:08.910> open<00:02:09.450> and<00:02:09.690> I'm<00:02:10.229> going

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
illustrator and go to open and I'm going

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:14.380 
illustrator and go to open and I'm going
to<00:02:10.470> go<00:02:10.590> ahead<00:02:10.739> and<00:02:11.160> go<00:02:11.849> into<00:02:12.120> my<00:02:12.660> map

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
to go ahead and go into my map

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:17.179 
to go ahead and go into my map
any<00:02:15.390> of<00:02:15.599> these<00:02:15.750> are<00:02:16.049> different<00:02:16.470> rotations<00:02:17.010> so

00:02:17.179 --> 00:02:17.189 
any of these are different rotations so

00:02:17.189 --> 00:02:18.860 
any of these are different rotations so
when<00:02:17.340> you<00:02:17.430> first<00:02:17.610> open<00:02:17.849> them<00:02:18.120> up<00:02:18.209> it<00:02:18.390> shows<00:02:18.569> you

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
when you first open them up it shows you

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.559 
when you first open them up it shows you
how<00:02:19.200> your<00:02:19.560> artwork<00:02:20.549> your<00:02:20.879> artwork<00:02:21.360> is

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:21.569 
how your artwork your artwork is

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:24.380 
how your artwork your artwork is
represented<00:02:22.230> by<00:02:22.260> the<00:02:22.500> F<00:02:22.829> so<00:02:23.730> then<00:02:23.909> that<00:02:24.120> will

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
represented by the F so then that will

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.369 
represented by the F so then that will
show<00:02:24.689> you<00:02:24.750> how<00:02:25.500> F<00:02:25.860> would<00:02:26.250> rotate<00:02:26.879> and<00:02:27.379> reflect

00:02:28.369 --> 00:02:28.379 
show you how F would rotate and reflect

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:32.000 
show you how F would rotate and reflect
over<00:02:29.129> and<00:02:29.250> over<00:02:29.459> again<00:02:30.079> this<00:02:31.079> is<00:02:31.319> your

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
over and over again this is your

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.190 
over and over again this is your
template<00:02:32.700> elements<00:02:33.390> layer<00:02:33.569> that<00:02:33.780> shows<00:02:34.019> you

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
template elements layer that shows you

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.009 
template elements layer that shows you
this<00:02:34.319> preview<00:02:34.799> so<00:02:35.400> the<00:02:36.090> first<00:02:36.390> thing<00:02:36.720> that<00:02:36.750> you

00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:37.019 
this preview so the first thing that you

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:38.479 
this preview so the first thing that you
want<00:02:37.170> to<00:02:37.230> do<00:02:37.349> is<00:02:37.470> obviously<00:02:37.680> have<00:02:38.069> your<00:02:38.220> layers

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:38.489 
want to do is obviously have your layers

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:42.440 
want to do is obviously have your layers
open<00:02:39.150> and<00:02:39.390> make<00:02:40.079> them<00:02:40.260> big<00:02:40.680> so<00:02:41.579> on<00:02:41.909> the<00:02:42.060> window

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
open and make them big so on the window

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:46.670 
open and make them big so on the window
go<00:02:42.659> to<00:02:42.690> layers<00:02:43.049> and<00:02:44.659> then<00:02:45.659> I<00:02:45.930> also<00:02:46.319> have<00:02:46.560> my

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
go to layers and then I also have my

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:47.539 
go to layers and then I also have my
artboards

00:02:47.539 --> 00:02:47.549 
artboards

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:51.949 
artboards
open<00:02:48.390> so<00:02:48.750> window<00:02:49.349> artboards<00:02:49.950> and<00:02:50.540> then<00:02:51.540> what

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
open so window artboards and then what

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:54.140 
open so window artboards and then what
we're<00:02:52.139> going<00:02:52.440> to<00:02:52.470> do<00:02:52.799> is<00:02:53.069> turn<00:02:53.549> off<00:02:53.609> the

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
we're going to do is turn off the

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:55.550 
we're going to do is turn off the
elements<00:02:54.720> layer<00:02:54.900> so<00:02:55.109> you<00:02:55.139> might<00:02:55.319> have<00:02:55.409> to

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
elements layer so you might have to

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.009 
elements layer so you might have to
scroll<00:02:55.829> down<00:02:55.889> and<00:02:56.370> template<00:02:57.060> elements<00:02:57.540> turns

00:02:58.009 --> 00:02:58.019 
scroll down and template elements turns

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:00.170 
scroll down and template elements turns
off<00:02:58.349> and<00:02:59.069> it<00:02:59.220> says<00:02:59.400> select<00:02:59.579> the<00:02:59.849> clipped

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
off and it says select the clipped

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:03.319 
off and it says select the clipped
elements<00:03:01.069> so<00:03:02.069> you<00:03:02.159> just<00:03:02.430> click<00:03:02.670> on<00:03:02.849> that<00:03:02.909> and

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:03.329 
elements so you just click on that and

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:05.569 
elements so you just click on that and
then<00:03:04.319> start<00:03:04.650> drawing<00:03:04.859> within<00:03:05.159> the<00:03:05.370> black

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:05.579 
then start drawing within the black

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:07.789 
then start drawing within the black
outline<00:03:05.849> now<00:03:06.510> unfortunately<00:03:07.349> it<00:03:07.409> looks<00:03:07.530> as<00:03:07.769> if

00:03:07.789 --> 00:03:07.799 
outline now unfortunately it looks as if

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:10.699 
outline now unfortunately it looks as if
there's<00:03:08.220> two<00:03:08.720> three<00:03:09.720> black<00:03:10.109> outlines

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
there's two three black outlines

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:13.640 
there's two three black outlines
these<00:03:11.159> here<00:03:11.579> are<00:03:11.989> artboards<00:03:12.989> so<00:03:13.260> that's<00:03:13.470> not

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
these here are artboards so that's not

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:15.979 
these here are artboards so that's not
what<00:03:13.859> they<00:03:13.980> are<00:03:14.010> talking<00:03:14.280> about<00:03:14.459> the<00:03:15.150> actual

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:15.989 
what they are talking about the actual

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:19.729 
what they are talking about the actual
cell<00:03:16.799> location<00:03:17.459> here<00:03:18.030> is<00:03:18.989> where<00:03:19.319> we<00:03:19.440> need<00:03:19.590> to

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
cell location here is where we need to

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:21.860 
cell location here is where we need to
draw<00:03:20.010> and<00:03:20.280> I'm<00:03:20.669> just<00:03:20.910> gonna<00:03:21.060> go<00:03:21.299> ahead<00:03:21.629> and

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
draw and I'm just gonna go ahead and

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:24.140 
draw and I'm just gonna go ahead and
draw<00:03:22.079> something<00:03:22.620> very<00:03:22.859> simple<00:03:23.250> just<00:03:23.819> to<00:03:23.970> show

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
draw something very simple just to show

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:25.729 
draw something very simple just to show
you<00:03:24.209> quickly<00:03:24.660> how<00:03:24.959> this<00:03:25.139> works<00:03:25.379> I'm<00:03:25.590> gonna

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:25.739 
you quickly how this works I'm gonna

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:28.309 
you quickly how this works I'm gonna
just<00:03:25.980> take<00:03:26.280> my<00:03:26.579> block<00:03:27.510> brush<00:03:27.780> tool<00:03:28.019> and<00:03:28.199> you

00:03:28.309 --> 00:03:28.319 
just take my block brush tool and you

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:30.409 
just take my block brush tool and you
can<00:03:28.379> see<00:03:28.530> as<00:03:28.769> soon<00:03:28.919> as<00:03:29.069> I<00:03:29.220> put<00:03:29.910> something<00:03:30.150> in

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:30.419 
can see as soon as I put something in

00:03:30.419 --> 00:03:33.530 
can see as soon as I put something in
here<00:03:30.599> it<00:03:30.750> repeats<00:03:31.489> so<00:03:32.489> if<00:03:32.609> we<00:03:32.790> stay<00:03:33.090> within<00:03:33.329> the

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
here it repeats so if we stay within the

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:37.220 
here it repeats so if we stay within the
borders<00:03:33.900> it<00:03:34.829> does<00:03:35.220> the<00:03:35.430> entire<00:03:35.760> artwork<00:03:36.359> if<00:03:37.019> I

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
borders it does the entire artwork if I

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:40.150 
borders it does the entire artwork if I
go<00:03:37.410> a<00:03:37.440> little<00:03:37.650> bit<00:03:37.829> over<00:03:38.129> the<00:03:38.220> border

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:40.160 
go a little bit over the border

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:43.400 
go a little bit over the border
it<00:03:41.160> only<00:03:41.430> takes<00:03:41.819> parts<00:03:42.209> of<00:03:42.389> it<00:03:42.510> so<00:03:42.840> it<00:03:42.930> chops<00:03:43.230> it

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:43.410 
it only takes parts of it so it chops it

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:46.250 
it only takes parts of it so it chops it
off<00:03:43.560> and<00:03:43.769> repeats<00:03:44.099> it<00:03:44.220> along<00:03:44.489> these<00:03:44.699> cells<00:03:45.449> so

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
off and repeats it along these cells so

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.979 
off and repeats it along these cells so
you<00:03:46.440> can<00:03:46.739> have<00:03:46.919> some<00:03:47.220> fun<00:03:47.549> doing<00:03:48.299> that<00:03:48.660> right

rearrange these you can still change

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:07.580 
rearrange these you can still change
these<00:04:04.980> and<00:04:05.310> rotate<00:04:06.209> and<00:04:06.599> delete<00:04:06.959> and<00:04:07.230> all<00:04:07.349> that

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:07.590 
these and rotate and delete and all that

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:12.649 
these and rotate and delete and all that
good<00:04:07.769> stuff<00:04:10.340> one<00:04:11.340> thing<00:04:11.669> that<00:04:11.879> you<00:04:12.060> might<00:04:12.269> want

00:04:12.649 --> 00:04:12.659 
good stuff one thing that you might want

00:04:12.659 --> 00:04:14.089 
good stuff one thing that you might want
to<00:04:12.750> consider<00:04:13.199> is<00:04:13.379> putting<00:04:13.650> a<00:04:13.709> background

00:04:14.089 --> 00:04:14.099 
to consider is putting a background

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:16.670 
to consider is putting a background
color<00:04:14.280> so<00:04:14.400> you<00:04:14.549> can<00:04:14.819> just<00:04:15.000> take<00:04:15.269> any<00:04:15.569> old<00:04:16.109> fill

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680 
color so you can just take any old fill

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:20.120 
color so you can just take any old fill
color<00:04:17.010> and<00:04:17.479> just<00:04:18.479> draw<00:04:18.959> a<00:04:18.989> big<00:04:19.289> rectangle<00:04:19.919> and

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.130 
color and just draw a big rectangle and

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:22.370 
color and just draw a big rectangle and
first<00:04:20.489> it<00:04:20.699> hides<00:04:20.940> everything<00:04:21.329> but<00:04:22.139> then<00:04:22.260> you

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:22.380 
first it hides everything but then you

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:26.270 
first it hides everything but then you
can<00:04:22.560> go<00:04:22.650> to<00:04:22.710> object<00:04:22.979> arrange<00:04:23.490> send<00:04:23.940> to<00:04:24.090> back

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:26.280 
can go to object arrange send to back

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:28.640 

once<00:04:26.940> you<00:04:27.210> wanna<00:04:27.420> change<00:04:27.810> that<00:04:28.110> color<00:04:28.440> it's

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:28.650 
once you wanna change that color it's

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:29.990 
once you wanna change that color it's
gonna<00:04:28.740> be<00:04:28.950> a<00:04:28.980> little<00:04:29.160> bit<00:04:29.370> more<00:04:29.520> complicated

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.000 
gonna be a little bit more complicated

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.460 
gonna be a little bit more complicated
you<00:04:30.390> just<00:04:30.570> take<00:04:30.750> your<00:04:30.840> direct<00:04:31.080> selection<00:04:31.320> tool

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:31.470 
you just take your direct selection tool

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:37.910 
you just take your direct selection tool
perhaps<00:04:31.950> to<00:04:34.430> to<00:04:35.430> select<00:04:35.730> that<00:04:36.090> I'm<00:04:36.840> gonna<00:04:37.710> go

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:37.920 
perhaps to to select that I'm gonna go

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:40.370 
perhaps to to select that I'm gonna go
ahead<00:04:38.040> and<00:04:38.450> follow<00:04:39.450> these<00:04:39.690> instructions<00:04:39.720> just

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:40.380 
ahead and follow these instructions just

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:43.760 
ahead and follow these instructions just
to<00:04:40.890> show<00:04:41.070> you<00:04:41.130> how<00:04:41.610> to<00:04:41.670> go<00:04:42.150> about<00:04:42.300> it<00:04:42.480> um<00:04:42.900> it

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:43.770 
to show you how to go about it um it

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:45.380 
to show you how to go about it um it
says<00:04:44.040> then<00:04:44.250> when<00:04:44.430> done<00:04:44.640> used<00:04:44.880> to<00:04:44.970> out<00:04:45.120> for<00:04:45.360> a

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:45.390 
says then when done used to out for a

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:48.950 
says then when done used to out for a
tool<00:04:45.890> you<00:04:46.890> can<00:04:47.220> just<00:04:47.640> go<00:04:48.000> to<00:04:48.030> your<00:04:48.390> artboard

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:48.960 
tool you can just go to your artboard

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:52.190 
tool you can just go to your artboard
tool<00:04:49.230> and<00:04:49.700> then<00:04:50.700> it<00:04:51.330> wants<00:04:51.660> you<00:04:51.780> to<00:04:51.900> select

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:52.200 
tool and then it wants you to select

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:56.960 
tool and then it wants you to select
artboard<00:04:52.890> number<00:04:53.340> two<00:04:53.730> I<00:04:55.220> hate<00:04:56.220> clicking<00:04:56.850> with

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:56.970 
artboard number two I hate clicking with

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:58.580 
artboard number two I hate clicking with
the<00:04:57.000> output<00:04:57.420> tool<00:04:57.630> because<00:04:57.930> sometimes<00:04:58.380> it

00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:58.590 
the output tool because sometimes it

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:00.230 
the output tool because sometimes it
messes<00:04:58.860> it<00:04:58.980> up<00:04:59.070> but<00:04:59.280> usually<00:04:59.820> it<00:04:59.880> can<00:05:00.000> just

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:00.240 
messes it up but usually it can just

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:02.120 
messes it up but usually it can just
click<00:05:00.510> on<00:05:00.750> the<00:05:00.930> name<00:05:01.140> and<00:05:01.169> then<00:05:01.410> it<00:05:01.710> changes

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:02.130 
click on the name and then it changes

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:03.890 
click on the name and then it changes
here<00:05:02.280> but<00:05:02.460> you<00:05:02.850> can<00:05:03.000> also<00:05:03.180> see<00:05:03.450> how<00:05:03.600> on<00:05:03.780> your

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:03.900 
here but you can also see how on your

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:05.840 
here but you can also see how on your
output<00:05:04.350> window<00:05:04.740> you<00:05:05.010> can<00:05:05.160> just<00:05:05.370> jump<00:05:05.640> between

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:05.850 
output window you can just jump between

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:07.159 
output window you can just jump between
those<00:05:06.210> and<00:05:06.390> I<00:05:06.450> think<00:05:06.660> that's<00:05:06.840> a<00:05:06.930> little<00:05:07.020> bit

00:05:07.159 --> 00:05:07.169 
those and I think that's a little bit

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:08.659 
those and I think that's a little bit
easier<00:05:07.560> instead<00:05:07.830> of<00:05:07.950> clicking<00:05:08.370> on<00:05:08.490> something

00:05:08.659 --> 00:05:08.669 
easier instead of clicking on something

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:10.850 
easier instead of clicking on something
wrong<00:05:09.000> and<00:05:09.180> dragging<00:05:09.540> it<00:05:09.630> around<00:05:09.750> and<00:05:10.140> then

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:10.860 
wrong and dragging it around and then

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:15.050 
wrong and dragging it around and then
immediately<00:05:12.470> so<00:05:13.470> say<00:05:13.770> for<00:05:13.800> weapon<00:05:14.430> devices

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:15.060 
immediately so say for weapon devices

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:18.200 
immediately so say for weapon devices
and<00:05:15.330> this<00:05:16.080> is<00:05:16.260> kind<00:05:16.530> of<00:05:16.620> showing<00:05:17.130> you<00:05:17.490> the

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:18.210 
and this is kind of showing you the

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:20.060 
and this is kind of showing you the
repeat<00:05:18.720> in<00:05:18.930> different<00:05:19.290> qualities<00:05:19.710> if<00:05:19.919> you

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:20.070 
repeat in different qualities if you

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:22.520 
repeat in different qualities if you
were<00:05:20.220> to<00:05:20.610> try<00:05:21.210> and<00:05:21.360> make<00:05:21.900> the<00:05:22.080> file<00:05:22.290> size

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:22.530 
were to try and make the file size

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:24.710 
were to try and make the file size
smaller<00:05:22.800> for<00:05:23.220> a<00:05:23.250> web<00:05:23.430> but<00:05:24.000> we're<00:05:24.419> just<00:05:24.450> gonna

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:24.720 
smaller for a web but we're just gonna

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:27.500 
smaller for a web but we're just gonna
go<00:05:24.870> ahead<00:05:24.960> and<00:05:25.050> say<00:05:25.290> safe<00:05:25.880> for<00:05:26.880> the<00:05:26.970> first<00:05:27.180> one

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:27.510 
go ahead and say safe for the first one

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:28.940 
go ahead and say safe for the first one
that<00:05:27.600> pops<00:05:27.660> up<00:05:28.140> and<00:05:28.350> we're<00:05:28.440> just<00:05:28.470> gonna<00:05:28.770> go

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:28.950 
that pops up and we're just gonna go

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:32.090 
that pops up and we're just gonna go
ahead<00:05:29.070> and<00:05:29.340> say<00:05:29.460> it<00:05:29.580> test<00:05:29.850> 1<00:05:30.350> test<00:05:31.350> repeat<00:05:31.860> 1

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:32.100 
ahead and say it test 1 test repeat 1

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:35.450 
ahead and say it test 1 test repeat 1
that's<00:05:32.820> a<00:05:32.940> PNG<00:05:33.240> file<00:05:33.710> I'm<00:05:34.710> gonna<00:05:34.919> replace<00:05:35.130> that

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:35.460 
that's a PNG file I'm gonna replace that

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:37.820 
that's a PNG file I'm gonna replace that
and<00:05:35.820> then<00:05:36.660> once<00:05:37.169> we're<00:05:37.350> done<00:05:37.470> we<00:05:37.650> can<00:05:37.800> just

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:37.830 
and then once we're done we can just

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:41.120 
and then once we're done we can just
click<00:05:38.250> away<00:05:38.760> and<00:05:39.180> we<00:05:39.510> can<00:05:39.780> actually<00:05:40.020> also<00:05:40.440> if

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:41.130 
click away and we can actually also if

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:43.969 
click away and we can actually also if
you<00:05:41.400> want<00:05:41.610> to<00:05:42.020> later<00:05:43.020> on<00:05:43.260> if<00:05:43.440> we<00:05:43.470> really<00:05:43.830> like

00:05:43.969 --> 00:05:43.979 
you want to later on if we really like

00:05:43.979 --> 00:05:45.980 
you want to later on if we really like
what<00:05:44.190> we've<00:05:44.400> been<00:05:44.430> doing<00:05:44.910> we<00:05:45.060> want<00:05:45.180> to<00:05:45.330> go<00:05:45.690> into

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:11.220 
always just create a big area make sure

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:13.159 
always just create a big area make sure
your<00:06:11.340> fill<00:06:11.610> is<00:06:11.760> on<00:06:11.970> top<00:06:12.210> and<00:06:12.510> then<00:06:12.690> you<00:06:12.720> can<00:06:12.990> use

00:06:13.159 --> 00:06:13.169 
your fill is on top and then you can use

00:06:13.169 --> 00:06:18.370 
your fill is on top and then you can use
your<00:06:13.470> repeat<00:06:14.070> here<00:06:14.400> and<00:06:15.770> this<00:06:16.770> repeat<00:06:17.370> is

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:18.380 
your repeat here and this repeat is

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:21.710 
your repeat here and this repeat is
obviously<00:06:19.380> not<00:06:19.710> as<00:06:20.210> interesting<00:06:21.210> as<00:06:21.330> some<00:06:21.570> of

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:21.720 
obviously not as interesting as some of

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:24.770 
obviously not as interesting as some of
the<00:06:21.810> other<00:06:22.020> options<00:06:22.440> that<00:06:22.800> we<00:06:23.100> can<00:06:23.340> create<00:06:24.060> it

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:24.780 
the other options that we can create it

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:26.360 
the other options that we can create it
almost<00:06:25.200> doesn't<00:06:25.500> even<00:06:25.650> look<00:06:25.860> like<00:06:25.919> a<00:06:26.130> real

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:26.370 
almost doesn't even look like a real

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:28.700 
almost doesn't even look like a real
repeat<00:06:26.820> because<00:06:27.390> it<00:06:27.540> has<00:06:27.750> like<00:06:27.960> these<00:06:28.110> borders

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:28.710 
repeat because it has like these borders

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:31.909 
repeat because it has like these borders
but<00:06:29.580> um<00:06:29.880> we're<00:06:30.660> gonna<00:06:30.780> create<00:06:31.140> some<00:06:31.410> more

00:06:31.909 --> 00:06:31.919 
but um we're gonna create some more

00:06:31.919 --> 00:06:33.860 
but um we're gonna create some more
intricate<00:06:32.340> ones<00:06:32.520> and<00:06:32.850> I'm<00:06:32.970> gonna<00:06:33.180> take<00:06:33.600> it

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:33.870 
intricate ones and I'm gonna take it

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:36.200 
intricate ones and I'm gonna take it
into<00:06:34.440> Photoshop<00:06:34.830> and<00:06:35.400> also<00:06:35.729> show<00:06:35.880> you<00:06:35.940> how<00:06:36.060> you

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:36.210 
into Photoshop and also show you how you

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:39.410 
into Photoshop and also show you how you
can<00:06:37.110> still<00:06:37.800> change<00:06:38.190> colors<00:06:38.640> even<00:06:38.940> though<00:06:39.090> you

00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:39.420 
can still change colors even though you

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:42.320 
can still change colors even though you
not<00:06:39.540> in<00:06:39.780> now<00:06:40.620> vector<00:06:41.160> arts<00:06:41.490> anymore<00:06:41.850> cuz<00:06:42.120> these

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:42.330 
not in now vector arts anymore cuz these

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:44.930 
not in now vector arts anymore cuz these
are<00:06:42.510> now<00:06:42.630> pixels<00:06:43.080> but<00:06:43.830> let's<00:06:44.040> just<00:06:44.340> go<00:06:44.580> a

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:44.940 
are now pixels but let's just go a

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:49.490 
are now pixels but let's just go a
little<00:06:45.150> bit<00:06:45.480> slower<00:06:46.050> so<00:06:47.300> okay<00:06:48.300> close<00:06:49.020> this<00:06:49.290> one

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:49.500 
little bit slower so okay close this one

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:50.450 
little bit slower so okay close this one
and<00:06:49.530> not<00:06:49.800> save<00:06:50.100> it

00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:50.460 
and not save it

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:54.230 
and not save it
and<00:06:51.080> here's<00:06:52.080> just<00:06:52.350> some<00:06:52.440> tests<00:06:53.010> that<00:06:53.820> I<00:06:53.940> did

00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:54.240 
and here's just some tests that I did

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:58.190 
and here's just some tests that I did
previously<00:06:54.660> and<00:06:54.930> my<00:06:55.230> close<00:06:55.530> to<00:06:55.740> you<00:06:55.860> as<00:06:56.010> well
