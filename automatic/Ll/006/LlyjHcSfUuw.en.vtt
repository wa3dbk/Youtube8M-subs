behind me is the SLS AMG Black Series
the<00:00:18.599> Black<00:00:18.840> Series<00:00:19.109> is<00:00:19.439> actually<00:00:19.919> more

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
the Black Series is actually more

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:21.890 
the Black Series is actually more
defined<00:00:20.520> as<00:00:20.789> what<00:00:21.060> happens<00:00:21.419> when<00:00:21.599> you<00:00:21.689> let

engineers<00:00:22.650> build<00:00:23.070> the<00:00:23.250> car<00:00:23.460> that<00:00:23.669> they<00:00:23.759> want

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
engineers build the car that they want

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.659 
engineers build the car that they want
to<00:00:24.060> build<00:00:24.239> it's<00:00:24.779> all<00:00:25.079> about<00:00:25.320> performance<00:00:25.739> it's

00:00:26.659 --> 00:00:26.669 
to build it's all about performance it's

00:00:26.669 --> 00:00:29.810 
to build it's all about performance it's
all<00:00:26.939> about<00:00:26.970> weight<00:00:27.930> savings<00:00:28.410> and<00:00:28.770> really<00:00:29.700> what

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
all about weight savings and really what

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.490 
all about weight savings and really what
we<00:00:29.910> start<00:00:30.119> off<00:00:30.210> with<00:00:30.390> is<00:00:30.509> the<00:00:30.629> SLS<00:00:31.079> as<00:00:31.259> it<00:00:31.379> is

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
we start off with is the SLS as it is

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:32.869 
we start off with is the SLS as it is
and<00:00:31.710> we<00:00:31.770> bring<00:00:31.950> a<00:00:32.040> lot<00:00:32.250> of<00:00:32.279> the<00:00:32.430> technology

00:00:32.869 --> 00:00:32.879 
and we bring a lot of the technology

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:34.490 
and we bring a lot of the technology
from<00:00:33.000> the<00:00:33.059> gt3<00:00:33.540> race<00:00:33.690> car<00:00:33.930> right<00:00:34.110> down<00:00:34.140> into

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
from the gt3 race car right down into

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.770 
from the gt3 race car right down into
this<00:00:34.710> so<00:00:35.280> we<00:00:35.430> widen<00:00:35.820> the<00:00:35.879> track<00:00:36.149> by<00:00:36.329> almost<00:00:36.600> an

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
this so we widen the track by almost an

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.630 
this so we widen the track by almost an
inch<00:00:36.960> both<00:00:37.230> front<00:00:37.500> and<00:00:37.620> rear<00:00:37.680> which<00:00:38.129> means<00:00:38.489> we

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
inch both front and rear which means we

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.310 
inch both front and rear which means we
also<00:00:38.940> had<00:00:39.180> to<00:00:39.270> ride<00:00:39.420> in<00:00:39.570> the<00:00:39.600> body<00:00:39.840> at<00:00:40.020> the<00:00:40.079> same

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
also had to ride in the body at the same

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.200 
also had to ride in the body at the same
time<00:00:40.530> we've<00:00:41.160> lightened<00:00:41.460> the<00:00:41.579> car<00:00:41.789> by<00:00:41.969> use<00:00:42.180> of

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
time we've lightened the car by use of

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.060 
time we've lightened the car by use of
carbon<00:00:42.690> fiber<00:00:43.079> and<00:00:43.350> carbon<00:00:43.620> fiber<00:00:43.829> reinforced

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
carbon fiber and carbon fiber reinforced

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.340 
carbon fiber and carbon fiber reinforced
plastics<00:00:44.940> so<00:00:45.090> we've<00:00:45.239> taken<00:00:45.270> things<00:00:46.110> such<00:00:46.320> as

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
plastics so we've taken things such as

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.530 
plastics so we've taken things such as
like<00:00:46.590> the<00:00:46.710> torque<00:00:46.980> tube<00:00:47.250> which<00:00:47.550> attaches<00:00:48.300> the

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:48.540 
like the torque tube which attaches the

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:50.510 
like the torque tube which attaches the
engine<00:00:48.870> to<00:00:48.960> the<00:00:48.989> transmission<00:00:49.079> and<00:00:49.920> instead

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
engine to the transmission and instead

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:51.860 
engine to the transmission and instead
of<00:00:50.610> making<00:00:50.880> that<00:00:51.000> out<00:00:51.180> of<00:00:51.270> aluminum<00:00:51.690> magnesium

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
of making that out of aluminum magnesium

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.110 
of making that out of aluminum magnesium
we've<00:00:52.800> made<00:00:53.010> it<00:00:53.130> out<00:00:53.250> of<00:00:53.399> carbon<00:00:53.670> reinforced

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
we've made it out of carbon reinforced

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.790 
we've made it out of carbon reinforced
plastic<00:00:54.600> there<00:00:54.810> saves<00:00:55.079> 40<00:00:55.440> some-odd<00:00:55.649> pounds

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
plastic there saves 40 some-odd pounds

power<00:02:21.400> is<00:02:21.700> really<00:02:22.000> what's<00:02:22.180> paramount<00:02:22.420> about

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
power is really what's paramount about

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.780 
power is really what's paramount about
this<00:02:23.020> vehicle<00:02:23.380> we've<00:02:23.500> taken<00:02:23.740> our<00:02:23.920> 6.2<00:02:24.580> liter

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
this vehicle we've taken our 6.2 liter

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:27.150 
this vehicle we've taken our 6.2 liter
normally<00:02:25.300> aspirated<00:02:25.450> v8<00:02:25.930> and<00:02:26.560> we've<00:02:26.680> now<00:02:26.860> run

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 
normally aspirated v8 and we've now run

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.810 
normally aspirated v8 and we've now run
it<00:02:27.310> to<00:02:27.900> 622<00:02:28.900> horsepower<00:02:29.350> in<00:02:30.130> addition<00:02:30.370> to<00:02:30.670> that

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:30.820 
it to 622 horsepower in addition to that

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:32.370 
it to 622 horsepower in addition to that
I've<00:02:31.030> just<00:02:31.150> that<00:02:31.360> horsepower<00:02:31.690> gain<00:02:32.110> we've

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:32.380 
I've just that horsepower gain we've

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:35.040 
I've just that horsepower gain we've
also<00:02:32.530> increased<00:02:33.220> it<00:02:33.459> our<00:02:33.550> BM<00:02:33.850> ban<00:02:34.060> up<00:02:34.240> to<00:02:34.330> 8,000

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.050 
also increased it our BM ban up to 8,000

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:36.960 
also increased it our BM ban up to 8,000
rpm<00:02:35.440> so<00:02:36.010> we've<00:02:36.130> had<00:02:36.160> to<00:02:36.340> change<00:02:36.580> a<00:02:36.700> lot<00:02:36.820> of

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
rpm so we've had to change a lot of

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:38.100 
rpm so we've had to change a lot of
