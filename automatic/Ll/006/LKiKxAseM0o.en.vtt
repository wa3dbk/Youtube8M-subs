00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
that out of the way and then you're

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.999 
that out of the way and then you're
going<00:02:05.369> to<00:02:05.460> press<00:02:05.719> on<00:02:06.719> this<00:02:06.990> pumped<00:02:07.439> area<00:02:07.770> where

you see a picture of the hand and it's

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.790 
you see a picture of the hand and it's
slowly<00:02:10.110> going<00:02:10.709> to<00:02:11.039> be<00:02:11.160> forcing<00:02:11.790> air<00:02:12.030> they

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 
slowly going to be forcing air they

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.410 
slowly going to be forcing air they
to<00:02:13.130> the<00:02:13.220> pad<00:02:13.400> chambers<00:02:13.880> through<00:02:14.120> the<00:02:14.210> pump

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
to the pad chambers through the pump

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.140 
to the pad chambers through the pump
gonna<00:02:15.350> be<00:02:15.470> running<00:02:15.800> all<00:02:16.340> the<00:02:16.670> way<00:02:16.700> down<00:02:16.910> one

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
gonna be running all the way down one

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:19.060 
gonna be running all the way down one
chamber<00:02:17.540> connecting<00:02:18.110> at<00:02:18.200> the<00:02:18.320> end<00:02:18.470> back<00:02:18.890> to

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:19.070 
chamber connecting at the end back to

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:20.470 
chamber connecting at the end back to
the<00:02:19.190> other<00:02:19.310> chamber<00:02:19.700> connecting<00:02:20.150> at<00:02:20.240> the<00:02:20.330> end

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
the other chamber connecting at the end

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.210 
the other chamber connecting at the end
through<00:02:20.810> the<00:02:20.840> other<00:02:21.020> chamber<00:02:21.380> so<00:02:21.830> it<00:02:21.890> takes<00:02:22.040> a

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 
through the other chamber so it takes a

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.460 
through the other chamber so it takes a
while<00:02:22.510> when<00:02:23.510> you're<00:02:23.630> done<00:02:23.810> you're<00:02:24.170> just<00:02:24.320> going

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470 
while when you're done you're just going

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:27.060 
while when you're done you're just going
to<00:02:24.760> screw<00:02:25.760> the<00:02:25.880> cap<00:02:26.060> back<00:02:26.090> on<00:02:26.450> there<00:02:26.690> and

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:27.070 
to screw the cap back on there and

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:31.000 
to screw the cap back on there and
you're<00:02:28.070> ready<00:02:28.220> to<00:02:28.370> go<00:02:29.110> for<00:02:30.110> fine-tuning<00:02:30.470> of

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
you're ready to go for fine-tuning of

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.280 
you're ready to go for fine-tuning of
the<00:02:31.070> pad<00:02:31.370> if<00:02:31.640> you've<00:02:31.880> blown<00:02:32.030> it<00:02:32.090> up<00:02:32.300> to<00:02:32.720> its<00:02:32.870> max

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
the pad if you've blown it up to its max

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.290 
the pad if you've blown it up to its max
using<00:02:33.770> the<00:02:33.860> hand<00:02:34.040> pump<00:02:34.190> and<00:02:34.430> you<00:02:34.880> lay<00:02:35.030> on<00:02:35.060> it

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:35.300 
using the hand pump and you lay on it

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:36.910 
using the hand pump and you lay on it
you<00:02:35.420> think<00:02:35.600> it's<00:02:35.690> a<00:02:35.720> little<00:02:35.780> bit<00:02:35.900> too<00:02:36.050> much<00:02:36.200> you

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
you think it's a little bit too much you

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.680 
you think it's a little bit too much you
do<00:02:37.130> have<00:02:37.310> an<00:02:37.610> adjustment<00:02:38.030> valve<00:02:38.360> here<00:02:38.510> at<00:02:38.630> the

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
do have an adjustment valve here at the

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:40.570 
do have an adjustment valve here at the
top<00:02:38.900> so<00:02:39.050> you<00:02:39.080> can<00:02:39.140> kind<00:02:39.380> of<00:02:39.440> just<00:02:39.650> tweak<00:02:40.430> that

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:40.580 
top so you can kind of just tweak that

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:43.000 
top so you can kind of just tweak that
open<00:02:40.910> a<00:02:40.970> little<00:02:41.090> bit<00:02:41.770> even<00:02:42.770> while<00:02:42.920> you're

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
open a little bit even while you're

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:44.440 
open a little bit even while you're
laying<00:02:43.190> on<00:02:43.430> it<00:02:43.550> let<00:02:43.730> a<00:02:43.760> little<00:02:43.880> bit<00:02:44.090> of<00:02:44.150> air<00:02:44.270> out

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
laying on it let a little bit of air out

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:46.570 
laying on it let a little bit of air out
close<00:02:44.840> it<00:02:45.020> back<00:02:45.140> up<00:02:45.200> it's<00:02:45.770> just<00:02:46.040> reach<00:02:46.340> above

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:46.580 
close it back up it's just reach above

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.040 
close it back up it's just reach above
the<00:02:46.640> head<00:02:46.790> so<00:02:47.120> it's<00:02:47.240> quick<00:02:47.450> and<00:02:47.480> easy<00:02:47.660> to<00:02:47.810> do

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:48.050 
the head so it's quick and easy to do

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:51.160 
the head so it's quick and easy to do
another<00:02:49.010> option<00:02:49.280> is<00:02:49.670> that<00:02:49.730> you<00:02:49.940> can<00:02:50.240> use<00:02:50.630> this

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
another option is that you can use this

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.920 
another option is that you can use this
top<00:02:51.470> valve<00:02:51.740> to<00:02:52.070> inflate<00:02:52.490> the<00:02:53.060> entire<00:02:53.390> pad<00:02:53.630> by

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
top valve to inflate the entire pad by

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:56.650 
top valve to inflate the entire pad by
mouth<00:02:54.140> I<00:02:54.410> did<00:02:55.370> that<00:02:55.520> prior<00:02:55.700> to<00:02:55.760> the<00:02:56.030> video<00:02:56.240> I

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:56.660 
mouth I did that prior to the video I

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:59.620 
mouth I did that prior to the video I
took<00:02:57.320> about<00:02:57.680> 25<00:02:58.190> or<00:02:58.250> 30<00:02:58.580> breaths<00:02:58.820> and<00:02:59.300> I<00:02:59.480> would

00:02:59.620 --> 00:02:59.630 
took about 25 or 30 breaths and I would

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:01.420 
took about 25 or 30 breaths and I would
call<00:02:59.780> them<00:02:59.900> good<00:03:00.140> breaths<00:03:00.380> so<00:03:00.620> either<00:03:01.130> way

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430 
call them good breaths so either way

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:02.620 
call them good breaths so either way
you've<00:03:01.610> got<00:03:01.730> a<00:03:01.760> little<00:03:01.910> bit<00:03:02.090> of<00:03:02.180> work<00:03:02.330> on<00:03:02.540> the

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:02.630 
you've got a little bit of work on the

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:05.440 
you've got a little bit of work on the
inflation<00:03:03.170> end<00:03:03.350> but<00:03:03.950> kelty<00:03:04.280> by<00:03:04.820> using<00:03:05.210> that

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
inflation end but kelty by using that

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:07.740 
inflation end but kelty by using that
pump<00:03:05.780> and<00:03:06.590> giving<00:03:06.920> you<00:03:06.980> the<00:03:07.070> option<00:03:07.220> here

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:07.750 
pump and giving you the option here

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:10.030 
pump and giving you the option here
makes<00:03:08.750> a<00:03:08.870> little<00:03:09.050> bit<00:03:09.140> easier<00:03:09.290> for<00:03:09.680> you<00:03:09.800> and

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
makes a little bit easier for you and

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:11.740 
makes a little bit easier for you and
for<00:03:10.550> what<00:03:10.760> you're<00:03:10.910> getting<00:03:11.270> which<00:03:11.510> is<00:03:11.660> an
