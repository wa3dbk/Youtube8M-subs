00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
to the flip-flop galaxy and get that

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:16.310 
to the flip-flop galaxy and get that
last<00:00:10.469> stop<00:00:13.969> it<00:00:14.969> looks<00:00:15.269> like<00:00:15.450> it's<00:00:15.630> a<00:00:15.809> prankster

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:04.360 
saves time you have to do to jump spins

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.230 
saves time you have to do to jump spins
and<00:01:04.839> a<00:01:04.930> lot<00:01:05.110> of<00:01:05.140> those<00:01:05.350> areas<00:01:06.030> pressing<00:01:07.030> long
