 [Music] 

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:11.719
 and you have been doing well for a while 

00:00:07.339 --> 00:00:14.420
 down that the vocation to all and that 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:17.359
 have to serve for the exams are 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:20.300
 things well a third time that's 

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:22.160
 a positive signal so it's special 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.420
 for all Mexicans who are 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.640
 examples 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:27.939
 [Music] 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:34.080
 they teach us many things and we all 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:45.229
 the people who are wanting 

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:45.229
 [Music] 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:52.780
 there we see the quality that there is but 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:56.350
 many times it also counts for many 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:58.780
 young people who have a good future and is 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:00.399
 difficult but I tell you it 's okay for the 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:01.460
 quality that there are as foreigners 

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:26.470
 that come 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:28.120
 [Music] 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:30.420
 I did not think the game was going to be 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:34.120
 as it was and good is a semifinal 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.020
 against another great team like it is 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:42.479
 Argentinian 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:42.479
 [Music] 

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:49.660
 really impressive what he has done 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:51.730
 this U-17 how up 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:54.460
 after debuting with a defeat as 

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:57.640
 painful before nigeria today is going to return 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:59.920
 to find this selection in the final 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:02.860
 the third time that Mexico reaches a 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:05.260
 final the two past the finished 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:06.970
 winning a selection of Brazil and the 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:09.130
 another one to the Uruguayan national team 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:11.350
 listen to what the gutierrez foal said 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:15.120
 raúl gutiérrez the technician of this 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:15.120
 selection today the term of the match 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:21.990
 and the truth is that very happy because 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:24.960
 after the start that we had as the 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:27.120
 overlapping wine team started to 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:30.480
 do what I knew and today I think that 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:32.160
 deservedly a lot of people may not 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.130
 I thought the game would be like 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:37.830
 how it was and when it's a semifinal 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:40.290
 against another great team like it is 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:42.840
 Argentina the objective was always raised 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:45.540
 to be in the final and we are here 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.100
 there are situations that we have to be more 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:49.910
 smart but we return to the same 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:52.380
 are the matches is the heat of the game and 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:54.240
 those things you have to correct them 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:57.450
 for the final if we lack a match 

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:59.820
 we need that party and to 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:03.390
 we will be very nice to be of 

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:05.400
 new fighting a final more and good 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:08.010
 then there the statements of raúl 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:10.560
 Gutiérrez I am very excited at the end 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:12.270
 of the game is to draw attention to what 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:14.310
 what this convinced man has achieved 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:17.340
 more I more than excited I had it 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:19.230
 convinced I do not know neither does it either 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:22.190
 what happened is that it has already 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:25.130
 been in the room it is already made 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:26.900
 but you do not know what it's about here is not what 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:28.670
 same is not to reach a final when 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:30.920
 you're at home when you have supported the 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:33.260
 people to today what it gives you to be so 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:35.330
 far away and have recovered from something that 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.950
 it's so complicated will be the doubts that 

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:38.840
 had with this national team with 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:40.910
 this new generation that takes raúl 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:43.190
 Gutiérrez if they could achieve something 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:44.990
 important outside the home if not the 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:47.870
 2011 had only been for being in the 

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:49.450
 Aztec stadium and also for raúl 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:52.160
 gutierrez 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:54.280
 missing the most important thing is to win the 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:54.280
 final 

00:03:54.960 --> 00:04:00.000
 I think so, because when you have 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:06.450
 two important background studying 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:08.790
 alone and also at level 17 if the 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:10.500
 structure that you have is envied by 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:12.450
 any by any selection of 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:15.120
 world of this category 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:16.800
 mentally once the knowledge that makes you 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:19.620
 face that team 

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:22.860
 italy brazil but with the mentality that 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:25.470
 have as they have worked it I think not 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:29.420
 it will be so favorable for them to go back to 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:29.420
 see the four of your group 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:40.680
 three of the four finals have them 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:42.510
 complicated the way of these guys 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:44.250
 apart from the mentality of which 

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:45.660
 was mentioning here is there that 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:48.630
 mention is a different process 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:52.440
 obviously but it is also a team 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:54.570
 different in the context that those 

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:56.790
 World Champions 2005 those 

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:58.890
 world champions of the edition 

00:04:56.790 --> 00:05:00.420
 previous they had some figure there 

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:03.060
 that highlighted someone 

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:05.580
 a prop in the team here is a group 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:07.680
 very very worked the team this goal to 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:09.450
 ball stop but talk about work what 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:11.280
 who says it's true that he is not the first 

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:13.200
 that make this team from Brazil 

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:15.600
 desperate team that marked pomegranates the 

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:18.630
 number 10 outside of the one that blunt that 

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:20.910
 was the leader who finished the third 

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:23.100
 the bench ends up banking the 

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:24.510
 team of raúl gutiérrez this team 

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:26.580
 after the match against nigeria that 

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:29.400
 they put him 6 after and only 

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:31.530
 they scored two goals plus one in one of the 

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:34.380
 group and one in the whole religion rule 

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:36.810
 by the direct elimination zone now 

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:39.060
 would be mexico for having the step of 

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:40.980
 argentina up and not in this not because 

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:43.590
 he said no no because they are the player as 

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:44.880
 for dark and sadly argentina 

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:51.020
 he has never shone 

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:55.620
 17 has never been a champion 5 

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:58.920
 argentina being able to be world champion 

00:05:55.620 --> 00:06:02.490
 at some point no but it was the 

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:05.160
 author is that it was everywhere in 85 

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:10.099
 a comparison is very high but but 

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:10.099
 in the way of the gods 

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:14.870
 we will change anything because mexico 

00:06:12.479 --> 00:06:14.870
 it will shine 

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:29.060
 nerves and I do not believe because they are guys already 

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:36.500
 international shares earned 40 

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:36.500
 matches were some of them 

00:06:40.069 --> 00:06:46.110
 the first time was even when it 

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:47.880
 the team responds is in the second but 

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:50.280
 also give credit to the rival a team 

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:53.340
 that works very well that plays very well 

00:06:50.280 --> 00:07:00.080
 was located to the gentlemen who has 

00:06:53.340 --> 00:07:00.080
 many variants in the worst states 

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:05.280
 playing in 1630 

00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:09.560
 that is an end already of your country were 

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:13.070
 in the master's 

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:15.960
 [Laughs] 

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:18.110
 even the weather in some places runs 

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:18.110
 same 

00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:25.770
 ideally get up and tell you something 

00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:29.520
 neither have they occurred in the 

00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:31.460
 flag as of heroes turbos win without 

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:35.810
 The Senate is also logical. 

00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:35.810
 celebrate until a girl wins the hand 

00:07:35.929 --> 00:07:40.610
 hand in hand 

00:07:40.999 --> 00:07:43.999
 16 

00:07:45.030 --> 00:07:52.710
 [Laughs] 

00:07:49.710 --> 00:07:52.710
 look
