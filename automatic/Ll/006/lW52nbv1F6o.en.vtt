teach them so when they dead time
they'll<00:02:09.869> be<00:02:10.020> ready<00:02:10.229> how's<00:02:10.649> the<00:02:10.770> chemistry

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
they'll be ready how's the chemistry

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.880 
they'll be ready how's the chemistry
between<00:02:11.360> use<00:02:12.360> a<00:02:12.630> canned<00:02:12.900> Richie<00:02:13.140> obviously

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
between use a canned Richie obviously

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
played in the first team last year with

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:17.000 
played in the first team last year with
you<00:02:15.990> guys<00:02:16.230> wanted<00:02:16.500> 30<00:02:16.650> more<00:02:16.800> how<00:02:16.890> do<00:02:16.950> you

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
you guys wanted 30 more how do you

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:18.440 
you guys wanted 30 more how do you
develop<00:02:17.220> that<00:02:17.459> chemistry<00:02:17.850> how<00:02:18.030> is<00:02:18.180> it<00:02:18.300> so<00:02:18.420> far

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
develop that chemistry how is it so far

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.170 
develop that chemistry how is it so far
like<00:02:19.319> there<00:02:19.530> was<00:02:19.620> a<00:02:19.650> process<00:02:19.950> company<00:02:20.760> at<00:02:21.150> the

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
like there was a process company at the

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.780 
like there was a process company at the
fresh<00:02:21.480> mount<00:02:21.720> plate<00:02:21.900> was<00:02:22.140> high<00:02:22.290> Riccio<00:02:22.790> my

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
fresh mount plate was high Riccio my

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.309 
fresh mount plate was high Riccio my
first<00:02:24.060> river<00:02:24.360> ridge<00:02:24.540> I<00:02:24.660> fresh<00:02:24.900> me<00:02:25.020> a<00:02:25.050> plate

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:25.319 
first river ridge I fresh me a plate

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:27.740 
first river ridge I fresh me a plate
aside<00:02:25.470> Richie<00:02:25.830> so<00:02:26.130> it's<00:02:26.670> just<00:02:26.850> a<00:02:26.940> process<00:02:27.120> and

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
aside Richie so it's just a process and

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.449 
aside Richie so it's just a process and
I<00:02:27.870> play<00:02:28.080> with<00:02:28.230> those<00:02:28.319> guys<00:02:28.590> are<00:02:28.800> like<00:02:28.950> so<00:02:29.250> last

I play with those guys are like so last
year<00:02:29.580> the<00:02:29.730> rotation<00:02:30.239> was<00:02:30.270> said<00:02:30.540> and<00:02:30.720> I<00:02:30.780> played

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
year the rotation was said and I played

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:33.770 
year the rotation was said and I played
with<00:02:31.100> you<00:02:32.100> know<00:02:32.190> with<00:02:32.430> those<00:02:32.819> guys<00:02:33.150> not<00:02:33.450> just

with you know with those guys not just

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.110 
with you know with those guys not just
the<00:02:33.989> maximum<00:02:34.769> a<00:02:34.860> thousand<00:02:35.250> time<00:02:35.519> so<00:02:35.790> it's<00:02:36.000> a

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
the maximum a thousand time so it's a

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.910 
the maximum a thousand time so it's a
processing<00:02:36.810> chemistry<00:02:37.350> is<00:02:37.440> great<00:02:37.709> we

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
processing chemistry is great we

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.920 
processing chemistry is great we
communicate<00:02:38.580> and<00:02:38.820> I<00:02:39.120> have<00:02:39.239> confidence<00:02:39.570> in

of learned under you Richie last two

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.590 
of learned under you Richie last two
years<00:02:46.950> what<00:02:47.220> have<00:02:47.310> you<00:02:47.370> seen<00:02:47.459> his<00:02:48.000> progression

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
years what have you seen his progression

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.479 
years what have you seen his progression
what<00:02:49.440> do<00:02:49.500> you<00:02:49.560> think<00:02:49.620> he<00:02:49.890> kind<00:02:50.100> of<00:02:50.130> brings<00:02:50.370> to

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
what do you think he kind of brings to

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:53.240 
what do you think he kind of brings to
the<00:02:50.580> table<00:02:50.760> I<00:02:51.500> you<00:02:52.500> know<00:02:52.530> he's<00:02:52.739> great<00:02:52.950> but<00:02:53.130> I

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
the table I you know he's great but I

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:54.949 
the table I you know he's great but I
tell<00:02:53.580> him<00:02:53.670> every<00:02:53.790> day<00:02:53.970> don't<00:02:54.239> let<00:02:54.540> you<00:02:54.840> know

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
tell him every day don't let you know

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:56.720 
tell him every day don't let you know
the<00:02:55.140> comparison<00:02:55.650> I<00:02:55.709> he<00:02:55.890> might<00:02:56.070> get<00:02:56.340> to<00:02:56.519> him<00:02:56.640> you

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
the comparison I he might get to him you

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.850 
the comparison I he might get to him you
know<00:02:56.790> it<00:02:57.030> at<00:02:57.420> the<00:02:57.540> end<00:02:57.630> of<00:02:57.690> day<00:02:57.840> he<00:02:58.019> night<00:02:58.230> open

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
know it at the end of day he night open

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:01.100 
know it at the end of day he night open
argument<00:02:59.280> kidney<00:02:59.519> he<00:02:59.670> give<00:02:59.940> green<00:03:00.269> so<00:03:00.540> he<00:03:01.019> has

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
argument kidney he give green so he has

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:03.290 
argument kidney he give green so he has
to<00:03:01.230> come<00:03:01.350> into<00:03:01.590> work<00:03:01.650> and<00:03:02.010> not<00:03:02.459> be<00:03:02.850> another

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:03.300 
to come into work and not be another

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:05.509 
to come into work and not be another
Bernard<00:03:03.840> Joaquin<00:03:04.170> come<00:03:04.650> in<00:03:04.800> try<00:03:05.130> to<00:03:05.190> be<00:03:05.340> better

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:05.519 
Bernard Joaquin come in try to be better

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:07.670 
Bernard Joaquin come in try to be better
than<00:03:05.760> Bernard<00:03:06.180> Mackenzie<00:03:06.630> so<00:03:06.780> he<00:03:07.230> comes<00:03:07.500> in

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
than Bernard Mackenzie so he comes in
