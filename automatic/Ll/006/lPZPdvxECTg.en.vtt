00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:34.270 
is a you know on one of these garden

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:36.360 
is a you know on one of these garden
rack<00:00:34.690> systems<00:00:35.140> where<00:00:35.530> I've<00:00:35.649> taken<00:00:35.680> air<00:00:36.040> level

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:36.370 
rack systems where I've taken air level

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:40.130 
rack systems where I've taken air level
so<00:00:36.670> the<00:00:37.330> lights<00:00:37.510> are<00:00:37.690> actually<00:00:37.920> just<00:00:38.920> you<00:00:39.760> know

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
so the lights are actually just you know

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.910 
so the lights are actually just you know
maybe<00:00:42.360> five<00:00:43.360> or<00:00:43.420> six<00:00:43.690> inches<00:00:43.870> less<00:00:44.260> than<00:00:44.530> two

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:44.920 
maybe five or six inches less than two

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:46.890 
maybe five or six inches less than two
feet<00:00:45.160> so<00:00:45.400> foot<00:00:45.610> and<00:00:45.730> a<00:00:45.760> half<00:00:45.880> so<00:00:46.390> yeah<00:00:46.600> I<00:00:46.630> guess

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:46.900 
feet so foot and a half so yeah I guess

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:49.080 
feet so foot and a half so yeah I guess
these<00:00:47.620> plants<00:00:48.010> are<00:00:48.160> creeping<00:00:48.460> up<00:00:48.610> on<00:00:48.790> a<00:00:48.820> foot

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:49.090 
these plants are creeping up on a foot

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:51.480 
these plants are creeping up on a foot
and<00:00:49.180> a<00:00:49.210> half<00:00:49.590> and<00:00:50.590> I<00:00:50.950> haven't<00:00:51.250> been

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:51.490 
and a half and I haven't been

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:53.819 
and a half and I haven't been
fertilizing<00:00:52.120> them<00:00:52.329> or<00:00:52.620> really<00:00:53.620> anything

00:00:53.819 --> 00:00:53.829 
fertilizing them or really anything

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:56.729 
fertilizing them or really anything
other<00:00:54.100> than<00:00:54.310> watering<00:00:54.640> them<00:00:54.850> and<00:00:55.739> complaining

00:00:56.729 --> 00:00:56.739 
other than watering them and complaining

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:00.000 
other than watering them and complaining
about<00:00:56.770> them<00:00:57.040> so<00:00:57.970> I<00:00:58.230> think<00:00:59.230> it's<00:00:59.410> time<00:00:59.590> for<00:00:59.620> them

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:00.010 
about them so I think it's time for them

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:01.500 
about them so I think it's time for them
to<00:01:00.100> have<00:01:00.220> a<00:01:00.250> little<00:01:00.340> haircut<00:01:00.730> because<00:01:00.940> I'm

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:01.510 
to have a little haircut because I'm

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:03.630 
to have a little haircut because I'm
just<00:01:01.660> tired<00:01:01.870> of<00:01:02.050> moving<00:01:02.170> these<00:01:02.440> around<00:01:02.500> and<00:01:03.100> so

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:03.640 
just tired of moving these around and so

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.060 
just tired of moving these around and so
they<00:01:03.760> don't<00:01:03.910> get<00:01:04.030> burned<00:01:04.210> but<00:01:04.390> lights<00:01:05.070> you
