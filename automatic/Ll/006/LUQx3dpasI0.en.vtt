00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:06.180
 01net tv all the high-tech news 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:07.200
 thank you for being with us as every day 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.059
 we took a little bit of altitude 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.800
 today we are on the roofs of 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.380
 the radio house france jérôme tu 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.219
 know well here no to I know a 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:14.639
 good twenty years that I have 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.160
 work 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.840
 it's good it's beautiful huh yes there are two 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.939
 month this magnificent view of the recent 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.100
 especially paris it's great all 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.550
 monuments we see them well well you 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.920
 Know what 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.740
 we are at altitude to discover 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.960
 news from the intel intel lab 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.160
 we opened the doors of his labs 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.000
 search then here there for example 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.860
 watch a robot assembly is even 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.469
 also works on systems of 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.180
 protection against hacking 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.540
 cars he could could happen in the 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.219
 future 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.750
 there are even systems also for 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.820
 protect your password even more 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.840
 computer there is something for all 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.510
 the tastes we made a small selection 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:54.860
 of 2.3 innovations that are worth the detour 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.860
 we present them right away 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.600
 and we start with a problem that 

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:03.030
 we all live every day it's the 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:06.700
 electronic device charging 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:08.440
 usb cable charger we are fed up and 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:10.750
 intel work with others 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:13.479
 builders to a simplification of 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:15.970
 all this look at this camera it's a 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:18.520
 bowl so he does not know to drink his 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:20.649
 coffee or its chocolate no no it's a 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.700
 bowl actually that eventually could 

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:23.409
 receive all your devices 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.190
 electronic devices to recharge them 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:25.630
 how it works 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:27.190
 listen it's probably the most 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:28.869
 simple that I have never been able to do you 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:30.250
 take your phone and you 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:31.840
 leave in the bowl is there that is what 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:34.929
 is going well it's charging 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:37.360
 that's it's called resent its part 

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:39.850
 of a consortium called the a4 wp 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:42.130
 which precisely governs this system of 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:44.560
 wireless charging of builders 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.030
 as samsung intel texas instruments 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.710
 bet on it then for now this 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:49.659
 is only a concept but it's rather 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:51.610
 seducing then everything else here 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:53.530
 it's a small demonstration of what 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:54.520
 is getting ready in terms of interface the 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.770
 famous human machine interface 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:59.229
 in other words, how to interact with a 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:01.390
 computer otherwise than by a keyboard 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:02.920
 a mouse all these things pretty 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:04.750
 traditional and the idea is 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.420
 to explore the trail of recognition 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:08.890
 of motion through cameras by 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.869
 example on this computer is a small 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:12.549
 software that is able to identify me 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:14.950
 the eyes the mouth 

00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:16.810
 sarr we know one is completely the 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.650
 system is the concept of the kinect of 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.350
 microsoft 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:22.030
 and then the device goes also and the 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:24.400
 software will recognize my hands and 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:26.440
 so the movements of my hands and I 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.780
 can thus interact with for example with 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.620
 this little video game 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:33.310
 that's catching little guys 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:35.320
 play in the game without touching any 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:36.910
 device so good it's not 

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:39.850
 totally new as a concept but 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:41.049
 the idea is to transfer things 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:43.510
 so we know for example on 

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:46.239
 kinect so side game consoles on a 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:47.650
 computer with this type of two 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:49.480
 software that works with three 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:52.239
 small cameras that are integrated into 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:53.650
 the computer screen good other type 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:54.459
 interface that could see the day 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:56.500
 perhaps 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:03:00.549
 do we ever know and that's enough 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:01.460
 impressively big it's a screen in 

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:03.850
 hologram 

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:06.170
 in 3d, that's where you see me 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:08.420
 pushed to click in the empty 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:09.680
 so generates a little silly but because 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:12.160
 I see the image that you 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:15.440
 do not see here I see pimples 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:19.550
 is all this and well in fact and generate 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:21.380
 in a magical way by a screen 

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:22.850
 which is below that is reflected on a 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:27.080
 frosted glass that gives that impression 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:29.630
 like that of getting out of the screen and my 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:31.610
 fingers but movements are analyzed by 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:33.020
 again a camera that is here 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:34.280
 so it's not totally new 

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:36.560
 had seen that we showed it to you on 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:37.700
 01net tv on the occasion of the cms de las 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:40.790
 vegas on the stand of a big 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:42.800
 TV builder is there and 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:45.440
 well intel shows that they work 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:46.520
 they too on this kind of track in term 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:47.870
 human machine interface 

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:49.730
 go one ends with the concept of 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:50.690
 connected car according to intel and you 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:52.820
 go see it's not sad 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:54.320
 good already we imagine we are in a 

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:55.520
 car and jérôme will drive 

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:57.380
 well you see it's not a real 

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:58.670
 car is not a video game 

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:59.210
 it's really about putting us in 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:00.980
 situation 

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:02.330
 bolloré in these courageous and well 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:05.090
 the idea is to have a car hyper 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:06.620
 communicating both with the outside 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:08.900
 with the outside environment the road 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:10.880
 etc but also with you and a 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:12.980
 car that could almost guess 

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:14.150
 emotions and sensations then already 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:16.640
 to start it's good you identify yourself 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:17.989
 with your smart exactly we will say that 

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:20.030
 all the data that concerns me are 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:22.370
 in my smartphone I pose here tac and 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:25.310
 hop and well the word computer recognizes 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:28.040
 he says hello to me on the screen he rule 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:29.960
 my seat my position to me and the 

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:31.190
 customize in fact the settings of the 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:33.950
 car exactly 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:35.840
 so after you start here that's it 

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:37.070
 it's gone here and then it's not this 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:39.650
 will happen more and more in 

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:41.060
 the vehicles now is that on 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:42.440
 the screens will see appearing 

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:44.000
 information typically I get some 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:45.920
 emails I get a phone call 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.470
 Well, that's because 

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:51.350
 classic and bomb atatra you get 

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:52.790
 an email from a lab that send you in 

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:54.050
 made of doctor time more precisely 

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:55.610
 who send you the 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:57.080
 he tells me that he wants to see me because of 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:58.610
 my results from medical analysts but 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:59.060
 he does not tell you what it is no that's it 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:01.159
 the problem 

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:03.169
 so a little stressed completely 

00:05:01.159 --> 00:05:05.090
 stressed style but yes what is it 

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:07.460
 is in these analyzes change a little too much 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:09.050
 of fat then there I am nervous and I 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:10.789
 will have a tendency to accelerate to no 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:11.659
 more drive as I should and the 

00:05:10.789 --> 00:05:12.800
 car felt they had a 

00:05:11.659 --> 00:05:15.050
 problem exactly 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:17.060
 and if I try to speed up committing 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:20.990
 imprudences and well in fact no she 

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:23.990
 will limit my speed very well ago 

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:26.030
 also a system to choose your 

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:27.979
 parking a yes so for example to 

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:29.240
 united states there are places or who are 

00:05:27.979 --> 00:05:31.009
 completely free but limited to one 

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:32.150
 certain duration and other things we can stay 

00:05:31.009 --> 00:05:34.280
 longer but you have to pay well 

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:35.780
 the information is displayed on the screen and 

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:37.759
 I choose where I want to go so there 

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:39.800
 it's really the interaction side with 

00:05:37.759 --> 00:05:41.840
 the external environment other types 

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:44.840
 of interactions I cross a school bus 

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:46.819
 and well the speed of my car decreases 

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:48.050
 the car slows down she will detect this 

00:05:46.819 --> 00:05:49.610
 bus that gets closer to the car 

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:50.690
 exactly loud enough a car that 

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:51.409
 can detect that it's a bus 

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:52.819
 school 

00:05:51.409 --> 00:05:55.580
 it's true that in the united states we 

00:05:52.819 --> 00:05:58.550
 easily mark they are finally yellow 

00:05:55.580 --> 00:06:00.620
 So that's good, it's a bit we'll say 

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:02.779
 abstract like build a there on 

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:05.509
 do not know too much in the east but we see 

00:06:02.779 --> 00:06:07.430
 that there is brain lyncher juice 

00:06:05.509 --> 00:06:09.259
 intel engineers who have 

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:11.270
 imagined this car that will exist a 

00:06:09.259 --> 00:06:12.650
 day maybe or maybe not then 

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:14.090
 it's already a reality to cars 

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:16.699
 connected we often talk about it on 01net 

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:19.880
 tv a 01 drive and intel is including 

00:06:16.699 --> 00:06:21.650
 very associated with bmw with a concept 

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:24.020
 finally not a concept with a one a 

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:26.629
 vehicle knows but who alas y 3 who 

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:28.759
 is the bmw the first electric bmw you 

00:06:26.629 --> 00:06:30.949
 see there for that look on and well 

00:06:28.759 --> 00:06:32.659
 those who occupy intel engineers 

00:06:30.949 --> 00:06:34.940
 today we see that we are still 

00:06:32.659 --> 00:06:36.849
 far from the basic pc here in all 

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:39.169
 case that goes one intel 1 it thinks 

00:06:36.849 --> 00:06:43.419
 1-0 tv all the news high tech on 

00:06:39.169 --> 00:06:43.419
 will be there tomorrow of course hi to all
