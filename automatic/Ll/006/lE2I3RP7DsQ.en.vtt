00:01:25.459 --> 00:01:25.469 
get out of springtomize to and pretty

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:27.849

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
so that's pretty cool I don't usually

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.569 
so that's pretty cool I don't usually
use<00:01:31.500> it<00:01:31.680> just<00:01:31.859> because<00:01:32.070> how<00:01:32.250> i<00:01:32.280> don't<00:01:32.399> really

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
use it just because how i don't really

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.940 
use it just because how i don't really
like<00:01:32.700> it<00:01:33.090> but<00:01:33.329> uh<00:01:33.390> i<00:01:33.719> guess<00:01:34.500> i<00:01:34.590> could<00:01:34.649> put<00:01:34.799> it<00:01:34.890> in

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
like it but uh i guess i could put it in

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.789 
like it but uh i guess i could put it in
the<00:01:35.100> top<00:01:35.250> five<00:01:35.460> tweaks<00:01:35.789> you<00:01:36.719> can<00:01:36.899> disable<00:01:37.409> and
