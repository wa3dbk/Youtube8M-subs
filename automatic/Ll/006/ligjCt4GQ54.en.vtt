rally sport supersport corvette bronze

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:33.810 
rally sport supersport corvette bronze
it's<00:04:31.150> actually<00:04:31.450> a<00:04:31.510> dash<00:04:31.690> dash<00:04:31.930> paint<00:04:32.260> code<00:04:32.820> so

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:33.820 
it's actually a dash dash paint code so

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:35.880 
it's actually a dash dash paint code so
I<00:04:34.210> haven't<00:04:34.810> done<00:04:34.870> any<00:04:35.080> restoration<00:04:35.440> is<00:04:35.710> for

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:35.890 
I haven't done any restoration is for

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:40.350 
I haven't done any restoration is for
ten<00:04:36.040> years<00:04:36.280> and<00:04:36.430> I<00:04:37.710> just<00:04:38.730> had<00:04:39.730> somebody<00:04:40.030> come

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:40.360 
ten years and I just had somebody come

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:41.610 
ten years and I just had somebody come
at<00:04:40.540> me<00:04:40.690> and<00:04:40.810> kept<00:04:40.930> throwing<00:04:41.110> money<00:04:41.290> at<00:04:41.410> me

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:41.620 
at me and kept throwing money at me

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:44.490 
at me and kept throwing money at me
until<00:04:41.770> I<00:04:41.860> accept<00:04:42.190> it<00:04:42.310> basically<00:04:42.760> so<00:04:43.500> that's

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:44.500 
until I accept it basically so that's

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:47.580 
until I accept it basically so that's
what<00:04:44.740> that<00:04:44.770> boils<00:04:45.220> down<00:04:45.370> to<00:04:45.990> we<00:04:46.990> got<00:04:47.140> Formula

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:47.590 
what that boils down to we got Formula

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:51.000 
what that boils down to we got Formula
One's<00:04:47.770> car<00:04:48.070> up<00:04:48.250> here<00:04:49.140> waiting<00:04:50.140> on<00:04:50.260> the<00:04:50.830> wheels

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:51.010 
One's car up here waiting on the wheels

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:53.070 
One's car up here waiting on the wheels
to<00:04:51.220> get<00:04:51.370> here<00:04:51.610> so<00:04:51.820> we<00:04:51.850> can<00:04:52.120> mock<00:04:52.570> it<00:04:52.600> up<00:04:52.810> for<00:04:53.020> the

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:53.080 
to get here so we can mock it up for the

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:54.300 
to get here so we can mock it up for the
rear<00:04:53.230> end<00:04:53.410> measurement<00:04:53.890> so<00:04:53.980> that's<00:04:54.130> going<00:04:54.250> to

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:54.310 
rear end measurement so that's going to

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:56.010 
rear end measurement so that's going to
be<00:04:54.400> like<00:04:55.060> projects<00:04:55.480> going<00:04:55.570> to<00:04:55.660> be<00:04:55.720> sitting<00:04:55.990> for

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:56.020 
be like projects going to be sitting for

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:59.280 
be like projects going to be sitting for
just<00:04:56.320> a<00:04:56.380> little<00:04:56.530> bit<00:04:56.650> but<00:04:57.430> we've<00:04:57.580> got<00:04:57.820> a<00:04:58.170> one<00:04:59.170> of
