00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
the a side it's not as good i wouldn't

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:04.910 
the a side it's not as good i wouldn't
recommend<00:02:03.600> it<00:02:03.960> but<00:02:04.049> you<00:02:04.170> can<00:02:04.290> jump<00:02:04.560> on<00:02:04.649> top<00:02:04.860> of

the<00:02:23.880> other<00:02:24.060> line<00:02:24.390> of<00:02:24.540> sight<00:02:24.720> I<00:02:24.750> have<00:02:24.810> which<00:02:25.080> is

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
the other line of sight I have which is

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.050 
the other line of sight I have which is
actually<00:02:25.320> really<00:02:25.650> really<00:02:25.740> good<00:02:25.950> if<00:02:26.670> people

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
actually really really good if people

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.150 
actually really really good if people
are<00:02:27.150> camping<00:02:27.330> up<00:02:27.570> in<00:02:27.690> the<00:02:27.840> sea<00:02:28.140> window<00:02:28.680> you<00:02:29.040> can

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
are camping up in the sea window you can

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:30.620 
are camping up in the sea window you can
actually<00:02:29.490> jump<00:02:29.730> up<00:02:29.910> to<00:02:29.940> the<00:02:30.120> base<00:02:30.300> of<00:02:30.510> this

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
actually jump up to the base of this

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:33.380 
actually jump up to the base of this
ladder<00:02:30.930> at<00:02:31.170> a<00:02:31.320> and<00:02:31.680> look<00:02:31.920> through<00:02:32.280> the<00:02:32.580> bus<00:02:33.150> in

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
ladder at a and look through the bus in

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:34.880 
ladder at a and look through the bus in
the<00:02:33.450> trucking<00:02:33.990> I'm<00:02:34.170> a<00:02:34.200> nice<00:02:34.410> line<00:02:34.620> of<00:02:34.740> sight

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
the trucking I'm a nice line of sight

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:36.500 
the trucking I'm a nice line of sight
into<00:02:35.070> that<00:02:35.490> window<00:02:35.880> and<00:02:35.910> you<00:02:36.090> can<00:02:36.120> take<00:02:36.360> him

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
into that window and you can take him

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.450 
into that window and you can take him
out<00:02:36.630> pretty<00:02:37.440> nice<00:02:37.620> line<00:02:37.830> of<00:02:37.980> sight<00:02:38.130> I<00:02:38.160> think

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:38.460 
out pretty nice line of sight I think

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:40.970 
out pretty nice line of sight I think
that's<00:02:38.640> only<00:02:38.790> in<00:02:39.000> black<00:02:39.180> ops<00:02:39.390> 2<00:02:39.630> so<00:02:40.320> it<00:02:40.800> wasn't

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
that's only in black ops 2 so it wasn't

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:42.800 
that's only in black ops 2 so it wasn't

there in black ops 1 and now on this

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.960 
there in black ops 1 and now on this
made<00:02:43.170> spot<00:02:43.440> so<00:02:43.590> this<00:02:43.709> is<00:02:43.860> actually<00:02:44.190> a<00:02:44.490> flash

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
made spot so this is actually a flash

you can also let see you can jump onto

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:10.430 
you can also let see you can jump onto
these<00:04:08.610> boats<00:04:08.880> back<00:04:09.120> here<00:04:09.390> I<00:04:09.570> don't<00:04:10.170> know<00:04:10.260> why

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:10.440 
these boats back here I don't know why

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:11.960 
these boats back here I don't know why
you<00:04:10.500> use<00:04:10.890> it<00:04:11.070> back<00:04:11.190> here<00:04:11.370> but<00:04:11.430> you<00:04:11.489> can<00:04:11.610> and

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:11.970 
you use it back here but you can and

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:13.400 
you use it back here but you can and
then<00:04:12.060> you<00:04:12.150> can<00:04:12.299> hop<00:04:12.600> yourself<00:04:12.959> back<00:04:13.140> up<00:04:13.170> onto

then you can hop yourself back up onto
the<00:04:13.560> boat<00:04:13.769> and<00:04:13.950> I<00:04:14.430> mean<00:04:14.850> I<00:04:14.880> guess<00:04:15.060> it's<00:04:15.239> a<00:04:15.299> good

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:15.390 
the boat and I mean I guess it's a good

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:16.789 
the boat and I mean I guess it's a good
hiding<00:04:15.750> spot<00:04:15.989> but<00:04:16.169> you<00:04:16.350> know<00:04:16.440> I<00:04:16.470> don't<00:04:16.620> really

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:16.799 
hiding spot but you know I don't really

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:19.069
