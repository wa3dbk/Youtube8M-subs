00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
there we go that looked like a t-bar

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:46.670 
there we go that looked like a t-bar
move<00:03:40.760> we've<00:03:41.760> got<00:03:41.880> music<00:03:42.000> and<00:03:45.290> so<00:03:46.290> I<00:03:46.319> won<00:03:46.530> that

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680 
move we've got music and so I won that

00:03:46.680 --> 00:04:01.550 
move we've got music and so I won that
one<00:03:46.830> thing<00:03:48.080> what<00:03:49.080> did<00:03:49.200> I

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:05.059 

as<00:04:02.430> you<00:04:02.580> can<00:04:02.730> see<00:04:03.380> there<00:04:04.380> is<00:04:04.470> a<00:04:04.530> sensible<00:04:04.980> and

00:04:05.059 --> 00:04:05.069 
as you can see there is a sensible and

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:06.140 
as you can see there is a sensible and
intelligent<00:04:05.099> way<00:04:05.580> to<00:04:05.640> play<00:04:05.849> like<00:04:06.030> all

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
intelligent way to play like all

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:07.640 
intelligent way to play like all
fighting<00:04:06.480> game<00:04:06.599> so<00:04:06.780> there's<00:04:06.930> strategy<00:04:07.170> to<00:04:07.530> it

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
fighting game so there's strategy to it

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:09.460 
fighting game so there's strategy to it
it's<00:04:07.920> just<00:04:08.099> about<00:04:08.280> practicing<00:04:08.819> and<00:04:09.000> learning

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:09.470 
it's just about practicing and learning

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:12.009 
it's just about practicing and learning
where<00:04:10.470> you<00:04:10.500> can<00:04:10.680> get<00:04:10.770> your<00:04:10.890> moves<00:04:11.099> in<00:04:11.310> and

00:04:12.009 --> 00:04:12.019 
where you can get your moves in and

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:14.780 
where you can get your moves in and
reacting<00:04:13.019> you<00:04:13.170> can<00:04:13.380> actually<00:04:13.530> counter<00:04:14.130> if

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 
reacting you can actually counter if

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:16.190 
reacting you can actually counter if
people<00:04:15.060> are<00:04:15.150> just<00:04:15.300> flailing<00:04:15.540> punches<00:04:16.049> out

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:16.200 
people are just flailing punches out

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:17.750 
people are just flailing punches out
wildly<00:04:16.530> it's<00:04:16.739> worries<00:04:16.980> you<00:04:17.160> just<00:04:17.459> counter

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:17.760 
wildly it's worries you just counter

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:19.310 
wildly it's worries you just counter
that<00:04:17.910> by<00:04:17.940> blocking<00:04:18.269> and<00:04:18.600> if<00:04:18.660> you<00:04:18.750> block<00:04:18.959> three

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:19.320 
that by blocking and if you block three

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:21.890 
that by blocking and if you block three
I<00:04:19.350> think<00:04:19.620> it<00:04:19.739> is<00:04:19.829> you<00:04:20.669> do<00:04:21.060> like<00:04:21.239> a<00:04:21.269> counter<00:04:21.750> move

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:21.900 
I think it is you do like a counter move

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:26.120 
I think it is you do like a counter move
to<00:04:22.290> that<00:04:22.440> so<00:04:22.650> you<00:04:22.680> can't<00:04:22.980> just<00:04:23.220> run<00:04:23.880> up<00:04:24.060> and<00:04:25.130> do

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:26.130 
to that so you can't just run up and do

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:27.770 
to that so you can't just run up and do
windmill<00:04:26.700> like<00:04:27.180> you're<00:04:27.419> in<00:04:27.510> the<00:04:27.570> school

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:27.780

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:29.000 
windmill like you're in the school

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:29.010 
playground that doesn't work you

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:30.050 
playground that doesn't work you
actually<00:04:29.280> have<00:04:29.370> to<00:04:29.430> be<00:04:29.520> a<00:04:29.550> bit<00:04:29.700> clever<00:04:29.910> about

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:30.060 
actually have to be a bit clever about

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:31.370 
actually have to be a bit clever about
and<00:04:30.270> if<00:04:30.330> you<00:04:30.419> watch<00:04:30.540> when<00:04:30.720> Dad<00:04:30.900> was<00:04:31.080> fighting

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:31.380 
and if you watch when Dad was fighting

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:32.780 
and if you watch when Dad was fighting
as<00:04:31.500> well<00:04:31.650> he<00:04:31.800> would<00:04:31.919> do<00:04:32.040> higher<00:04:32.310> texts<00:04:32.729> and

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:32.790 
as well he would do higher texts and

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:34.550 
as well he would do higher texts and
lower<00:04:33.000> texts<00:04:33.389> and<00:04:33.479> mix<00:04:33.630> it<00:04:33.750> up<00:04:33.870> you<00:04:34.410> actually

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:34.560 
lower texts and mix it up you actually

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:36.680 
lower texts and mix it up you actually
have<00:04:34.800> to<00:04:34.919> block<00:04:35.100> high<00:04:35.310> and<00:04:35.610> lock<00:04:35.850> load<00:04:36.090> little

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:36.690 
have to block high and lock load little

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:38.840 
have to block high and lock load little
bit<00:04:36.810> out<00:04:36.960> breath<00:04:37.200> a<00:04:37.470> little<00:04:38.370> bit<00:04:38.520> sweaty

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:38.850
