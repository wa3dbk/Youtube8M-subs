the draft order here and in this case

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.849 
the draft order here and in this case
we're<00:00:26.340> denver<00:00:26.789> and<00:00:27.300> we're<00:00:28.019> drafting<00:00:28.470> seventh

we're denver and we're drafting seventh
overall<00:00:29.220> and<00:00:30.830> because<00:00:31.830> we<00:00:31.980> had<00:00:32.099> the<00:00:32.189> same

all<00:04:55.840> of<00:04:55.870> the<00:04:56.110> tests<00:04:56.560> during<00:04:56.890> the<00:04:57.010> combine<00:04:57.460> you

00:04:58.260 --> 00:04:58.270 
all of the tests during the combine you

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:00.180 
all of the tests during the combine you
have<00:04:58.480> to<00:04:58.690> judge<00:04:59.140> for<00:04:59.320> yourself<00:04:59.710> whether<00:04:59.950> that

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:00.190 
have to judge for yourself whether that

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:03.060 
have to judge for yourself whether that
means<00:05:00.370> they're<00:05:01.090> hiding<00:05:01.420> something<00:05:01.690> or<00:05:02.070> maybe

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:03.070 
means they're hiding something or maybe

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:04.410 
means they're hiding something or maybe
they're<00:05:03.280> just<00:05:03.310> really<00:05:03.580> good<00:05:03.850> and<00:05:04.060> they<00:05:04.150> didn't

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:04.420 
they're just really good and they didn't

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:07.140 
they're just really good and they didn't
want<00:05:04.570> to<00:05:04.630> bother<00:05:05.100> also<00:05:06.100> some<00:05:06.340> positions<00:05:06.880> like

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:07.150 
want to bother also some positions like

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:08.430 
want to bother also some positions like
the<00:05:07.300> linemen<00:05:07.720> do<00:05:07.870> not<00:05:08.020> have<00:05:08.200> a<00:05:08.230> position

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:08.440 
the linemen do not have a position

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:12.660 
the linemen do not have a position
specific<00:05:09.190> test<00:05:10.590> so<00:05:11.590> we<00:05:11.740> see<00:05:11.920> now<00:05:12.130> we're<00:05:12.430> on<00:05:12.550> the

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:12.670 
specific test so we see now we're on the

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:16.860 
specific test so we see now we're on the
clock<00:05:13.440> so<00:05:14.700> we<00:05:15.700> can<00:05:15.880> make<00:05:16.030> our<00:05:16.210> selection<00:05:16.720> right

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:16.870 
clock so we can make our selection right

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:21.000 
clock so we can make our selection right
now<00:05:17.490> we<00:05:18.490> can<00:05:18.670> have<00:05:19.090> our<00:05:19.240> staff<00:05:20.200> finish<00:05:20.620> it<00:05:20.800> now

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:21.010 
now we can have our staff finish it now

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:23.400 
now we can have our staff finish it now
we<00:05:21.070> know<00:05:21.280> we<00:05:21.430> needed<00:05:21.610> a<00:05:21.760> tackle<00:05:22.270> and<00:05:22.570> Roderick

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:23.410 
we know we needed a tackle and Roderick

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:28.380 
we know we needed a tackle and Roderick
Bovie<00:05:23.770> here<00:05:24.780> seems<00:05:25.780> to<00:05:25.990> be<00:05:26.580> somebody<00:05:27.580> that<00:05:27.790> we

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:28.390 
Bovie here seems to be somebody that we

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:30.150 
Bovie here seems to be somebody that we
might<00:05:28.600> well<00:05:28.780> be<00:05:28.960> interested<00:05:29.380> in<00:05:29.500> he<00:05:29.710> looks

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:30.160 
might well be interested in he looks

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:32.909 
might well be interested in he looks
like<00:05:30.340> he<00:05:30.610> tests<00:05:31.120> out<00:05:31.240> well<00:05:31.419> in<00:05:31.570> every<00:05:31.919> category

00:05:32.909 --> 00:05:32.919 
like he tests out well in every category

00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:40.220 
like he tests out well in every category
here<00:05:37.740> so<00:05:38.740> we<00:05:38.860> might<00:05:38.890> well<00:05:39.220> want<00:05:39.460> to<00:05:39.520> select<00:05:39.760> him

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:40.230 
here so we might well want to select him

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:44.610 
here so we might well want to select him
or<00:05:41.230> we<00:05:41.710> might<00:05:42.070> want<00:05:42.310> to<00:05:42.370> just<00:05:43.230> look<00:05:44.230> into<00:05:44.500> other

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:44.620 
or we might want to just look into other

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:46.440 
or we might want to just look into other
positions<00:05:44.890> maybe<00:05:45.460> we<00:05:45.610> have<00:05:45.730> somebody<00:05:45.970> we

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:46.450 
positions maybe we have somebody we

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:47.880 
positions maybe we have somebody we
identified<00:05:46.930> before<00:05:47.290> the<00:05:47.410> draft<00:05:47.590> that<00:05:47.770> we

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:47.890 
identified before the draft that we

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:50.880 
identified before the draft that we
really<00:05:48.160> wanted<00:05:48.400> to<00:05:48.460> target<00:05:49.740> in<00:05:50.740> this<00:05:50.830> case

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:50.890 
really wanted to target in this case

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:53.909 
really wanted to target in this case
let's<00:05:51.370> have<00:05:51.550> the<00:05:51.900> staff<00:05:52.900> make<00:05:53.140> look<00:05:53.410> selection

00:05:53.909 --> 00:05:53.919 
let's have the staff make look selection

00:05:53.919 --> 00:06:01.520 
let's have the staff make look selection
and<00:05:54.040> see<00:05:54.490> what<00:05:54.610> they<00:05:54.760> do<00:05:58.260> you<00:05:59.260> can<00:05:59.410> see<00:05:59.620> the

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:01.530 
and see what they do you can see the

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:04.080 
and see what they do you can see the
simulation<00:06:02.530> is<00:06:02.919> moving<00:06:03.250> forward<00:06:03.580> again<00:06:03.850> and

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:04.090 
simulation is moving forward again and

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:06.570 
simulation is moving forward again and
indeed<00:06:04.990> they<00:06:05.200> did<00:06:05.260> take<00:06:05.650> both<00:06:05.980> he's<00:06:06.160> from<00:06:06.430> Ohio

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:06.580 
indeed they did take both he's from Ohio

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:08.730 
indeed they did take both he's from Ohio
State<00:06:07.090> so<00:06:07.419> he<00:06:07.570> is<00:06:07.660> now<00:06:07.840> on<00:06:08.020> your<00:06:08.050> team<00:06:08.380> he<00:06:08.590> will

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:08.740 
State so he is now on your team he will

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:11.430 
State so he is now on your team he will
get<00:06:09.210> signed<00:06:10.210> to<00:06:10.330> your<00:06:10.480> team<00:06:10.690> automatically

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:11.440

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:23.800 
we can speed up the draft here make it

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:25.980 
we can speed up the draft here make it
go<00:06:24.040> really<00:06:24.340> really<00:06:24.760> fast<00:06:25.090> we're<00:06:25.660> not<00:06:25.810> all<00:06:25.960> that

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:25.990 
go really really fast we're not all that

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:28.260 
go really really fast we're not all that
interested<00:06:26.710> and<00:06:26.919> at<00:06:27.370> any<00:06:27.520> time<00:06:27.790> we<00:06:27.910> can<00:06:28.060> take

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:28.270 
interested and at any time we can take

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:30.150 
interested and at any time we can take
control<00:06:28.600> and<00:06:29.020> we'll<00:06:29.230> continue<00:06:29.440> at<00:06:29.710> this<00:06:29.830> speed

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:30.160 
control and we'll continue at this speed

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:31.950 
control and we'll continue at this speed
until<00:06:30.460> we're<00:06:30.669> on<00:06:30.760> the<00:06:30.880> clock<00:06:31.000> again<00:06:31.450> here<00:06:31.840> we

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:31.960 
until we're on the clock again here we

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:35.550 
until we're on the clock again here we
now<00:06:32.169> are<00:06:32.410> in<00:06:32.440> the<00:06:32.680> third<00:06:32.890> round<00:06:34.200> we<00:06:35.200> can<00:06:35.350> take<00:06:35.530> a

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:35.560 
now are in the third round we can take a

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:38.279 
now are in the third round we can take a
look<00:06:35.770> to<00:06:35.830> see<00:06:36.130> who<00:06:36.280> we<00:06:36.970> drafted<00:06:37.510> we<00:06:37.690> got<00:06:38.050> a<00:06:38.080> wide

00:06:38.279 --> 00:06:38.289 
look to see who we drafted we got a wide

00:06:38.289 --> 00:06:39.929 
look to see who we drafted we got a wide
receiver<00:06:38.770> in<00:06:38.860> the<00:06:38.950> second

00:06:39.929 --> 00:06:39.939 
receiver in the second

00:06:39.939 --> 00:06:42.549 
receiver in the second
so<00:06:40.939> maybe<00:06:41.629> we're<00:06:41.839> looking<00:06:41.869> for<00:06:42.169> a<00:06:42.349> linebacker

00:06:42.549 --> 00:06:42.559 
so maybe we're looking for a linebacker

00:06:42.559 --> 00:06:46.329 
so maybe we're looking for a linebacker
this<00:06:43.129> time<00:06:44.589> so<00:06:45.589> we<00:06:45.679> can<00:06:45.799> take<00:06:45.979> a<00:06:46.009> look<00:06:46.129> at<00:06:46.249> the

00:06:46.329 --> 00:06:46.339 
this time so we can take a look at the

00:06:46.339 --> 00:06:48.099 
this time so we can take a look at the
outside<00:06:46.699> linebackers<00:06:47.269> who<00:06:47.389> available<00:06:47.869> here's

let's just see what the so down slow

00:07:08.209 --> 00:07:11.349 
let's just see what the so down slow
down<00:07:08.239> the<00:07:08.479> simulation<00:07:09.049> and<00:07:09.229> see<00:07:09.529> what<00:07:10.359> our

00:07:11.349 --> 00:07:11.359 
down the simulation and see what our

00:07:11.359 --> 00:07:13.449 
down the simulation and see what our
staff<00:07:11.629> picks<00:07:11.989> for<00:07:12.259> us<00:07:12.409> and<00:07:12.709> we<00:07:13.039> got<00:07:13.159> a<00:07:13.219> tight
