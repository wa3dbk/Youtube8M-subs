first<00:00:11.790> thing<00:00:11.940> we<00:00:12.059> are<00:00:12.150> going<00:00:12.179> to<00:00:12.389> do<00:00:12.480> is<00:00:12.599> start

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
first thing we are going to do is start

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.690 
first thing we are going to do is start
with<00:00:13.019> the<00:00:13.110> head<00:00:13.320> to<00:00:13.860> make<00:00:14.040> things<00:00:14.219> easier

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
with the head to make things easier

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.790 
with the head to make things easier
start<00:00:15.210> with<00:00:15.330> a<00:00:15.360> circle<00:00:15.599> then<00:00:16.379> in<00:00:16.529> the<00:00:16.619> center

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
start with a circle then in the center

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.310 
start with a circle then in the center
top<00:00:17.100> make<00:00:17.460> each<00:00:17.640> side<00:00:18.000> pointing<00:00:18.480> like<00:00:18.750> so<00:00:19.050> it

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
top make each side pointing like so it

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:31.840 
top make each side pointing like so it
kind<00:00:19.980> of<00:00:20.070> look<00:00:20.279> like<00:00:20.310> a<00:00:20.490> V

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:31.850 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:34.060 

then<00:00:32.599> we<00:00:32.750> will<00:00:32.900> draw<00:00:33.050> a<00:00:33.080> zigzag<00:00:33.560> in<00:00:33.710> the<00:00:33.770> center

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:34.070 
then we will draw a zigzag in the center

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:35.860 
then we will draw a zigzag in the center
and<00:00:34.190> this<00:00:34.760> will<00:00:34.940> be<00:00:35.030> the<00:00:35.150> parting<00:00:35.510> of<00:00:35.570> the<00:00:35.630> hair

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:35.870 
and this will be the parting of the hair

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:37.870 
and this will be the parting of the hair
I<00:00:35.990> like<00:00:36.380> to<00:00:36.500> vary<00:00:36.740> the<00:00:36.920> size<00:00:37.070> of<00:00:37.310> my<00:00:37.400> zig<00:00:37.640> zags

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:37.880 
I like to vary the size of my zig zags

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:39.940 
I like to vary the size of my zig zags
since<00:00:38.240> hair<00:00:38.450> is<00:00:38.600> never<00:00:38.870> perfect<00:00:39.110> and<00:00:39.440> doing

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:39.950 
since hair is never perfect and doing

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:42.340 
since hair is never perfect and doing
this<00:00:40.070> gives<00:00:40.340> a<00:00:40.430> little<00:00:40.700> more<00:00:40.850> realism<00:00:41.390> even<00:00:42.260> if

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:42.350 
this gives a little more realism even if

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
this gives a little more realism even if
it's<00:00:42.500> super<00:00:42.860> cartoony

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:48.370 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:50.819 

now<00:00:49.329> at<00:00:49.570> the<00:00:49.660> bottom<00:00:49.960> you<00:00:50.199> will<00:00:50.230> stop<00:00:50.590> and

00:00:50.819 --> 00:00:50.829 
now at the bottom you will stop and

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:54.880 
now at the bottom you will stop and
partner<00:00:51.430> zigzag<00:00:51.850> so<00:00:52.360> you'll<00:00:52.510> have<00:00:52.690> two<00:00:52.930> tails

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:54.890 
partner zigzag so you'll have two tails

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:57.340 
partner zigzag so you'll have two tails
if<00:00:55.130> you<00:00:55.640> want<00:00:55.880> more<00:00:56.059> than<00:00:56.239> two<00:00:56.420> pigtails<00:00:56.660> keep

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:57.350 
if you want more than two pigtails keep

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:05.079 
if you want more than two pigtails keep
parting<00:00:57.710> the<00:00:57.739> hair<00:00:57.829> until<00:00:58.160> you're<00:00:58.430> satisfied

00:01:05.079 --> 00:01:05.089 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:07.599 

the<00:01:05.719> way<00:01:05.869> I<00:01:05.899> draw<00:01:06.259> braids<00:01:06.590> is<00:01:06.770> simply<00:01:07.310> drawing

00:01:07.599 --> 00:01:07.609 
the way I draw braids is simply drawing

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:09.940 
the way I draw braids is simply drawing
a<00:01:07.789> continuous<00:01:08.390> set<00:01:08.630> of<00:01:08.750> lines<00:01:08.929> it'll<00:01:09.649> kind<00:01:09.859> of

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:09.950 
a continuous set of lines it'll kind of

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:11.560 
a continuous set of lines it'll kind of
look<00:01:10.070> like<00:01:10.219> an<00:01:10.340> uneven<00:01:10.759> heart<00:01:10.969> with<00:01:11.179> a<00:01:11.210> curved

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:11.570 
look like an uneven heart with a curved

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:36.980 
look like an uneven heart with a curved
line<00:01:11.689> in<00:01:12.020> the<00:01:12.079> middle

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.560 

and<00:01:37.490> then<00:01:38.490> I<00:01:38.579> like<00:01:38.759> to<00:01:38.880> slowly<00:01:39.149> make<00:01:39.390> them

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
and then I like to slowly make them

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.980 
and then I like to slowly make them
smaller<00:01:39.840> as<00:01:40.049> I<00:01:40.170> go<00:01:40.320> down<00:01:41.600> it's<00:01:42.600> hard<00:01:42.869> to

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
smaller as I go down it's hard to

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.749 
smaller as I go down it's hard to
explain<00:01:43.170> so<00:01:43.829> I<00:01:43.860> suggest<00:01:44.310> getting<00:01:44.460> some

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
explain so I suggest getting some

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.399 
explain so I suggest getting some
scratch<00:01:45.060> paper<00:01:45.090> and<00:01:45.540> practicing<00:01:46.049> the<00:01:46.170> lines

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
scratch paper and practicing the lines

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.499 
scratch paper and practicing the lines
i'm<00:01:46.649> making<00:01:46.979> after<00:01:47.640> a<00:01:47.670> while<00:01:47.820> it<00:01:48.090> just<00:01:48.119> what

hair<00:03:53.150> i'm<00:03:53.329> pretty<00:03:54.019> sure<00:03:54.200> i'm<00:03:54.319> saying<00:03:54.500> that

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:54.680 
hair i'm pretty sure i'm saying that

00:03:54.680 --> 00:04:00.360 
hair i'm pretty sure i'm saying that
wrong<00:03:54.829> but<00:03:55.549> yes<00:03:56.060> you<00:03:56.840> kind<00:03:57.079> of<00:03:57.140> get<00:03:57.260> the<00:03:57.379> drift

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:00.370 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:02.920 

unlike<00:04:01.370> most<00:04:01.579> things<00:04:01.879> you<00:04:02.000> shade<00:04:02.239> hair<00:04:02.689> is

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:02.930 
unlike most things you shade hair is

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:05.110 
unlike most things you shade hair is
best<00:04:03.260> if<00:04:03.439> you<00:04:03.560> make<00:04:03.709> long<00:04:04.069> and<00:04:04.370> short<00:04:04.790> strokes

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:05.120 
best if you make long and short strokes

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:06.910 
best if you make long and short strokes
I<00:04:05.420> like<00:04:05.989> to<00:04:06.110> make<00:04:06.200> the<00:04:06.349> center<00:04:06.560> of<00:04:06.590> the<00:04:06.739> hair

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:06.920 
I like to make the center of the hair

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:08.589 
I like to make the center of the hair
the<00:04:07.069> lightest<00:04:07.370> point<00:04:07.640> and<00:04:07.819> since<00:04:08.120> the<00:04:08.299> hair<00:04:08.480> is

00:04:08.589 --> 00:04:08.599 
the lightest point and since the hair is

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:11.860 
the lightest point and since the hair is
split<00:04:08.810> in<00:04:08.900> two<00:04:09.110> I<00:04:09.349> have<00:04:09.799> two<00:04:10.129> centers<00:04:10.519> and<00:04:10.870> that

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:11.870 
split in two I have two centers and that

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:13.750 
split in two I have two centers and that
is<00:04:12.019> why<00:04:12.140> i<00:04:12.170> shaded<00:04:12.560> the<00:04:12.769> center<00:04:13.129> and<00:04:13.340> both

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:13.760 
is why i shaded the center and both

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:35.750 
is why i shaded the center and both
sides<00:04:14.060> of<00:04:14.180> the<00:04:14.269> hair

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:35.760 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:38.180 

I<00:04:35.820> do<00:04:36.630> the<00:04:36.870> same<00:04:36.900> thing<00:04:37.170> for<00:04:37.560> the<00:04:37.620> braids<00:04:37.890> but

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:38.190 
I do the same thing for the braids but

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:39.620 
I do the same thing for the braids but
since<00:04:38.430> it's<00:04:38.580> so<00:04:38.760> small<00:04:39.000> it's<00:04:39.240> kind<00:04:39.390> of<00:04:39.420> hard<00:04:39.600> to

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:39.630 
since it's so small it's kind of hard to

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:41.150 
since it's so small it's kind of hard to
notice<00:04:39.840> so<00:04:40.200> it's<00:04:40.350> okay<00:04:40.680> if<00:04:40.710> you<00:04:40.860> don't<00:04:40.950> follow

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:41.160 
notice so it's okay if you don't follow

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:44.810 
notice so it's okay if you don't follow
the<00:04:41.280> same<00:04:41.580> rules

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:44.820 

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:49.340 

I<00:04:47.090> like<00:04:48.090> to<00:04:48.210> go<00:04:48.330> over<00:04:48.360> again<00:04:48.810> with<00:04:48.990> my<00:04:49.110> base

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:49.350 
I like to go over again with my base

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:50.990 
I like to go over again with my base

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:51.000

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:07.020

if you like you can go over everything

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:12.659
