00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.730
 hard-fought party very friction expect that 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.730
 is so well 

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:13.090
 if I do not know if rubbed to such a point 

00:00:10.049 --> 00:00:15.430
 that has become a hard match for 

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:17.670
 the warnings that was many for 

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:21.910
 the team of which were for lack 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:23.740
 they were not quiroga can you talk or something 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:25.720
 well and we had how much was not bothered and 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:27.099
 they were two for lack and seven for because 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:30.490
 for telling them why they charge us that 

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:32.380
 then there are things that condition you 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:34.810
 to grab the ball with anger to 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:36.520
 do not insult him so as not to tell him anything and for 

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:38.710
 what grabs the strong ball of takes off 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:41.620
 yellow or you looked at me with garage takes you out 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:43.600
 yellow and you end up saying learn 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:44.980
 to play football are things that 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.900
 you can not see outside but on the court 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:48.700
 It gives you a lot of impotence, said lunati 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:51.220
 that is with his temper to me not to a 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:52.510
 mate stop talking and learn to 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:55.690
 play football that pretty bad do 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:57.460
 then the rest of the 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:59.640
 party venues included the dance played well 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:01.860
 no no 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:05.770
 I do not take away merit from vÃ©lez a great rival 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:08.320
 he played very well he did not handle the ball well 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:10.090
 but we need extreme 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:12.429
 concentration 90 minutes and there are things 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:15.340
 within the party that you end up with 

00:01:12.429 --> 00:01:16.719
 taking out of the game and they are things of 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:18.850
 impotence where you can not say anything 

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:20.799
 where they finish you right away 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:24.429
 conditioning where the game our 

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:26.890
 that are based on a strong game but if 

00:01:24.429 --> 00:01:28.240
 an intense and good game and you end up 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:30.310
 conditioning the first time with 5 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.079
 cards that the second time you already have 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:34.780
 that play more the need for a match 

00:01:32.079 --> 00:01:37.450
 more than virtual then we stop is 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.950
 well the victory of vÃ©lez because if not no 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.140
 I know if it's okay because we do 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:42.459
 we would have scored the goal at six 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:44.909
 minutes and the story has been changed 

00:01:42.459 --> 00:01:46.920
 I believe that 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.460
 it was a match where vÃ©lez handled better 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:52.609
 the ball where he created situations but 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:55.789
 so everything ends up reaching the goal by 

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:58.289
 situations where we out there 

00:01:55.789 --> 00:02:00.840
 We are wrong and therefore not by merit 

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:02.240
 they the first goal out there we made a mistake 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.130
 the ball stopped the second goal 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:06.899
 unfortunately there is a blunder before the 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:10.049
 Rebound goal a player our 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:11.549
 practically went against then there's 

00:02:10.049 --> 00:02:13.379
 things that if we have been 

00:02:11.549 --> 00:02:16.230
 concentrated that concentration by 

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:17.730
 there is distorted by the work of the 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.420
 party for the things that you inside 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:23.010
 of the party is out there the result 17 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.420
 lose the unbeaten like that with a 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.459
 weird middle environment with so many 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:29.190
 cautions these things long 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:31.360
 much much because we elaborate 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:33.270
 we are laburantes 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:36.750
 and these things d 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:38.940
 or I respect you I do not know if you disrespected 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:40.320
 that everyone who says what they want 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.760
 we are both laborers not 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:44.160
 we want to harm anyone we want what 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:46.560
 better for belgrano we break the soul 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:48.030
 to achieve point in each but in each 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.210
 court came the field of vÃ©lez where 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:52.740
 he knows that it is very difficult to do a job 

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:54.870
 very hard during the week I was coming here to 

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:57.330
 to do a very hard job and within the 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:59.070
 court you end up driving like 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:03.510
 if you had never played football or 

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:05.460
 can not have a dialogue this fluid 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:07.590
 with the referee when on the other side 

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:09.860
 immediately receive many reproaches 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.860
 Thank you 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:12.950
 heart
