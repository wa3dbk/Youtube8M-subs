00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.150 
with the lightest I'd so there's the
light<00:02:01.520> side<00:02:01.789> and<00:02:02.060> then<00:02:02.599> here<00:02:02.989> is<00:02:03.140> the<00:02:03.830> dark

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:04.160 
light side and then here is the dark

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:07.210 
light side and then here is the dark
side<00:02:04.429> or<00:02:04.840> one<00:02:05.840> has<00:02:06.050> like<00:02:06.289> more<00:02:06.590> shimmer<00:02:06.950> than

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:07.220 
side or one has like more shimmer than

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:08.469 
side or one has like more shimmer than
the<00:02:07.340> other<00:02:07.489> so<00:02:07.819> I'm<00:02:07.880> going<00:02:08.000> to<00:02:08.030> start<00:02:08.149> with<00:02:08.360> the

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 
the other so I'm going to start with the

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:12.550 
the other so I'm going to start with the
light<00:02:08.690> side<00:02:08.989> and<00:02:10.629> just<00:02:11.629> apply<00:02:11.810> that<00:02:12.260> to<00:02:12.530> the

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
light side and just apply that to the

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:17.470 
light side and just apply that to the
inner<00:02:12.950> part<00:02:13.340> of<00:02:13.489> my<00:02:13.580> lips<00:02:15.790> and<00:02:16.790> it's<00:02:17.030> actually

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
inner part of my lips and it's actually

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.200 
inner part of my lips and it's actually
really<00:02:17.720> pretty<00:02:17.959> by<00:02:18.200> itself

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:21.210 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:30.160 

but<00:02:21.600> just<00:02:21.870> to<00:02:22.020> enter<00:02:22.260> hearts<00:02:22.590> with<00:02:22.710> my<00:02:22.830> lips

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.140 

then<00:02:31.170> using<00:02:31.200> the<00:02:31.620> darker<00:02:32.070> side<00:02:32.100> I'm<00:02:32.670> going<00:02:32.730> to

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
then using the darker side I'm going to

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.920 
then using the darker side I'm going to
go<00:02:33.240> ahead<00:02:33.270> and<00:02:34.370> work<00:02:35.370> it<00:02:35.580> only<00:02:35.790> on<00:02:36.120> the<00:02:36.690> outer

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
go ahead and work it only on the outer

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:49.040 
go ahead and work it only on the outer
parts<00:02:37.650> of<00:02:37.770> my<00:02:38.160> lips

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:51.560 

and<00:02:49.500> this<00:02:49.770> actually<00:02:50.010> gives<00:02:50.430> you<00:02:50.790> the<00:02:51.450> illusion

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
and this actually gives you the illusion

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:54.290 
and this actually gives you the illusion
of<00:02:52.110> having<00:02:52.320> like<00:02:52.770> a<00:02:52.920> fuller<00:02:53.310> lip<00:02:53.700> or<00:02:53.940> a<00:02:53.970> fuller

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 
of having like a fuller lip or a fuller

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:57.680 
of having like a fuller lip or a fuller
pout<00:02:54.630> because<00:02:55.590> you're<00:02:56.580> highlighting<00:02:57.030> the

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
pout because you're highlighting the

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:59.600 
pout because you're highlighting the
full<00:02:57.990> parts<00:02:58.410> of<00:02:58.560> your<00:02:58.770> lip<00:02:58.980> so<00:02:59.190> the<00:02:59.280> bottom

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
full parts of your lip so the bottom

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:02.150 
full parts of your lip so the bottom
part<00:02:59.790> here<00:03:00.060> or<00:03:00.300> this<00:03:01.110> part<00:03:01.410> here<00:03:01.620> typically

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
part here or this part here typically

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.240 
part here or this part here typically
the<00:03:02.730> same<00:03:02.940> spots<00:03:03.330> that<00:03:03.570> they<00:03:03.780> would<00:03:03.960> be

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
the same spots that they would be

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:07.370 
the same spots that they would be
injecting<00:03:05.250> collagen<00:03:05.910> if<00:03:06.150> you<00:03:06.600> had<00:03:06.780> thin<00:03:06.990> lips

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
injecting collagen if you had thin lips

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.980 
injecting collagen if you had thin lips
so<00:03:08.000> skip<00:03:09.000> the<00:03:09.120> surgery<00:03:09.450> and<00:03:09.570> just<00:03:09.630> pick<00:03:09.840> up<00:03:09.930> the

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:20.990 
so skip the surgery and just pick up the
lipstick<00:03:16.580> and<00:03:18.290> this<00:03:19.290> is<00:03:19.470> how<00:03:19.680> you<00:03:20.010> use<00:03:20.580> the

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
lipstick and this is how you use the

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.080 
lipstick and this is how you use the
dual<00:03:21.330> lipsticks<00:03:22.200> now<00:03:23.010> if<00:03:23.310> you<00:03:23.550> don't<00:03:23.790> want<00:03:24.000> to

moisturized<00:04:03.900> so<00:04:04.230> the<00:04:04.470> formula<00:04:04.890> is<00:04:04.920> excellent

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:05.670

and I really like the effect that it

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:10.550 
and I really like the effect that it
gives<00:04:08.910> me<00:04:09.120> and<00:04:09.390> I<00:04:09.690> don't<00:04:09.870> even<00:04:09.959> need<00:04:10.200> a<00:04:10.260> lip
