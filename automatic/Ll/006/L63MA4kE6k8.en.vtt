00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:29.930 
these bars I see on my radar that now we

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:34.250 
these bars I see on my radar that now we
are<00:01:30.170> at<00:01:30.290> 4<00:01:30.560> nautical<00:01:30.890> miles<00:01:31.100> to<00:01:31.780> touchdown

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:34.260 
are at 4 nautical miles to touchdown

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.320 
are at 4 nautical miles to touchdown
you<00:01:34.680> can<00:01:34.830> see<00:01:35.070> the<00:01:35.190> runway<00:01:35.340> in<00:01:35.880> front<00:01:35.940> of<00:01:36.240> you

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:36.330 
you can see the runway in front of you

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:39.540 
you can see the runway in front of you
yes<00:01:36.630> okay

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:42.570 

to<00:01:40.030> continue<00:01:40.530> following<00:01:41.530> that<00:01:42.010> horizontal

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:42.580 
to continue following that horizontal

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:50.450 
to continue following that horizontal
and<00:01:43.000> vertical<00:01:43.420> bars

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:55.820 

is<00:01:50.850> everything<00:01:51.210> okay<00:01:51.600> on<00:01:51.630> board<00:01:51.930> I<00:01:52.190> guess

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:55.830 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:57.399 

so
