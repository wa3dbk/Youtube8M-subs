00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:15.040 
think that was my fault anyway because I

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.039 
think that was my fault anyway because I
had<00:01:15.250> no<00:01:15.549> fuel<00:01:15.850> in<00:01:15.969> the<00:01:16.060> bike<00:01:16.210> and<00:01:16.450> I<00:01:16.659> decided

had no fuel in the bike and I decided
i'll<00:01:17.289> try<00:01:17.530> and<00:01:17.649> start<00:01:17.859> it<00:01:18.009> but<00:01:18.100> it<00:01:18.219> was<00:01:18.340> on<00:01:18.399> here

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:18.800 
i'll try and start it but it was on here

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:56.380 
it just happens to be on the CBF on two
boys<00:01:55.220> I<00:01:55.250> had<00:01:55.520> fun<00:01:55.670> with<00:01:55.790> the<00:01:55.820> fuel<00:01:56.030> pump<00:01:56.180> that

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390 
boys I had fun with the fuel pump that

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:58.270 
boys I had fun with the fuel pump that
they<00:01:56.540> decided<00:01:57.230> they<00:01:57.260> weren't<00:01:57.620> gonna<00:01:57.800> sort<00:01:58.100> out

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:58.280

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.700 
they decided they weren't gonna sort out
I<00:01:58.610> think<00:01:59.480> they<00:01:59.570> first<00:01:59.870> became<00:02:00.140> worried<00:02:00.470> about

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:00.710 
I think they first became worried about

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:06.430 
I think they first became worried about
it<00:02:00.860> in<00:02:01.000> 2010<00:02:02.140> model<00:02:03.140> and<00:02:03.790> it<00:02:04.790> got<00:02:04.970> to<00:02:05.140> 2011<00:02:06.140> and

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:06.440 
it in 2010 model and it got to 2011 and

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.490 
it in 2010 model and it got to 2011 and
it<00:02:06.620> was<00:02:06.710> still<00:02:06.860> present<00:02:07.310> and<00:02:07.960> they<00:02:08.960> must<00:02:09.350> have

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:09.500 
it was still present and they must have

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.210 
it was still present and they must have
been<00:02:09.590> having<00:02:09.679> a<00:02:09.860> flood<00:02:10.399> of<00:02:10.429> warranty<00:02:11.240> you<00:02:11.690> know

fine it's been amazing in the ice I'm a

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:08.800 
fine it's been amazing in the ice I'm a
little<00:04:07.760> bit<00:04:08.120> worried<00:04:08.390> about<00:04:08.510> getting<00:04:08.660> a

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:08.810

bigger<00:04:08.960> right<00:04:09.170> now<00:04:09.350> I<00:04:10.070> think<00:04:10.700> it<00:04:10.820> may<00:04:11.270> be<00:04:11.300> even

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:11.630 
bigger right now I think it may be even

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:12.850 
bigger right now I think it may be even
better<00:04:11.810> because<00:04:12.110> it<00:04:12.290> allowed<00:04:12.410> bigger<00:04:12.620> tires

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:12.860 
better because it allowed bigger tires
