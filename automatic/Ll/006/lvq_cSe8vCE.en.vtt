00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.810 
know usually you're you know you're done
with<00:00:21.810> your<00:00:22.080> preparation<00:00:22.680> by<00:00:22.830> now<00:00:23.039> anyways<00:00:23.550> and

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
with your preparation by now anyways and

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.759 
with your preparation by now anyways and
you're<00:00:24.510> just<00:00:24.539> waiting<00:00:24.840> the<00:00:24.990> day<00:00:25.170> out<00:00:25.380> and<00:00:25.619> then

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
you're just waiting the day out and then

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.140 
you're just waiting the day out and then
getting<00:00:26.010> ready<00:00:26.250> to<00:00:26.400> play<00:00:26.609> and<00:00:26.640> then<00:00:27.000> you've

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
getting ready to play and then you've

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.359 
getting ready to play and then you've
got<00:00:27.180> a<00:00:27.359> late<00:00:28.320> turn<00:00:28.590> around<00:00:28.859> to<00:00:28.980> what's<00:00:29.160> next

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
got a late turn around to what's next

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.749 
got a late turn around to what's next
and<00:00:29.699> so<00:00:30.230> you<00:00:31.230> can<00:00:31.349> hopefully<00:00:31.529> play<00:00:32.279> well<00:00:32.520> and

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
and so you can hopefully play well and

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.459 
and so you can hopefully play well and
then<00:00:32.880> and<00:00:33.300> then<00:00:33.480> move<00:00:33.660> on<00:00:33.809> to<00:00:33.840> what's<00:00:34.110> next<00:00:34.410> a

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
then and then move on to what's next a

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.040 
then and then move on to what's next a
little<00:00:34.620> bit<00:00:34.710> earlier<00:00:34.739> in<00:00:35.160> the<00:00:35.250> day<00:00:35.960> last<00:00:36.960> year

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
little bit earlier in the day last year

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.020 
little bit earlier in the day last year
games<00:00:37.260> Carmela's<00:00:37.739> only<00:00:37.980> averaged<00:00:38.460> about<00:00:38.610> 11

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
games Carmela's only averaged about 11

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.090 
games Carmela's only averaged about 11
shots<00:00:39.329> as<00:00:39.719> opposed<00:00:40.020> to<00:00:40.170> the<00:00:40.290> 20<00:00:40.770> we've<00:00:40.920> taken

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
shots as opposed to the 20 we've taken

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.979 
shots as opposed to the 20 we've taken
before<00:00:41.280> notice<00:00:41.910> the<00:00:42.090> change<00:00:42.360> in<00:00:42.450> the<00:00:42.690> hosta

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
before notice the change in the hosta

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.790 
before notice the change in the hosta
goes<00:00:43.170> again<00:00:43.760> well<00:00:44.760> i<00:00:45.480> think<00:00:46.110> there's<00:00:46.530> a<00:00:46.590> couple

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
goes again well i think there's a couple

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.090 
goes again well i think there's a couple
of<00:00:47.010> factors<00:00:47.670> their<00:00:47.969> number<00:00:48.960> one<00:00:49.110> is<00:00:49.320> when<00:00:50.010> he

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
of factors their number one is when he

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.100 
of factors their number one is when he
takes<00:00:50.280> 20<00:00:50.579> shots<00:00:50.760> he's<00:00:51.000> really<00:00:51.239> good<00:00:51.449> when<00:00:52.050> he

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
takes 20 shots he's really good when he

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.170 
takes 20 shots he's really good when he
takes<00:00:52.260> 11<00:00:52.649> shots<00:00:52.829> he's<00:00:53.039> really<00:00:53.309> good<00:00:53.489> and<00:00:53.730> the

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
takes 11 shots he's really good and the

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.930 
takes 11 shots he's really good and the
Knicks<00:00:54.390> are<00:00:54.480> good<00:00:54.690> I<00:00:55.410> think<00:00:56.309> regardless<00:00:56.430> i<00:00:56.879> do

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
Knicks are good I think regardless i do

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.700 
Knicks are good I think regardless i do
think<00:00:57.239> that<00:00:57.300> the<00:00:57.660> bottom<00:00:57.960> line<00:00:58.140> is<00:00:58.350> is<00:00:58.500> that

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
think that the bottom line is is that

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.950 
think that the bottom line is is that
when<00:00:58.980> he<00:00:59.219> he's<00:00:59.850> not<00:00:59.879> in<00:01:00.210> at<00:01:00.359> the<00:01:00.449> end<00:01:00.600> of<00:01:00.690> games

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
when he he's not in at the end of games

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.810 
when he he's not in at the end of games
in<00:01:01.289> the<00:01:01.559> last<00:01:01.590> two<00:01:01.920> games<00:01:02.160> because<00:01:02.399> it's<00:01:02.550> 40

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
in the last two games because it's 40

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.630 
in the last two games because it's 40
point<00:01:03.000> blowouts<00:01:03.420> so<00:01:04.229> it's<00:01:04.500> a<00:01:04.589> you<00:01:05.519> know

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
point blowouts so it's a you know

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.010 
point blowouts so it's a you know
they've<00:01:06.000> gotten<00:01:06.299> all<00:01:06.360> their<00:01:06.540> work<00:01:06.689> done<00:01:06.720> in

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
they've gotten all their work done in

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.130 
they've gotten all their work done in
the<00:01:07.110> first<00:01:07.229> three<00:01:07.530> quarters<00:01:07.770> and<00:01:08.070> and<00:01:09.140> they've

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
the first three quarters and and they've

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.260 
the first three quarters and and they've
been<00:01:10.260> awfully<00:01:10.619> impressive<00:01:10.830> and<00:01:11.340> does<00:01:12.240> that

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
been awfully impressive and does that

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.210 
been awfully impressive and does that
change<00:01:12.720> if<00:01:12.930> it's<00:01:13.080> a<00:01:13.140> close<00:01:13.350> game<00:01:13.380> at<00:01:13.799> the<00:01:13.890> end<00:01:14.070> I

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
change if it's a close game at the end I

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.179 
change if it's a close game at the end I
don't<00:01:14.369> know<00:01:14.490> but<00:01:15.320> you<00:01:16.320> know<00:01:16.439> I<00:01:16.470> would<00:01:17.040> think

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
don't know but you know I would think

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.850 
don't know but you know I would think
that<00:01:17.310> you<00:01:17.490> know<00:01:18.360> if<00:01:18.590> anybody's<00:01:19.590> coaching

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
that you know if anybody's coaching

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.080 
that you know if anybody's coaching
Carmelo<00:01:20.130> you<00:01:20.250> wanted<00:01:20.490> to<00:01:20.549> shoot<00:01:20.700> and<00:01:20.850> score

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
Carmelo you wanted to shoot and score

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.429 
Carmelo you wanted to shoot and score
because<00:01:21.240> he<00:01:21.450> can<00:01:21.540> surely<00:01:21.750> do<00:01:21.990> that<00:01:22.170> at<00:01:22.320> the

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
because he can surely do that at the

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.190 
because he can surely do that at the
highest<00:01:22.979> rate<00:01:23.280> possible<00:01:23.490> but<00:01:23.990> they've<00:01:24.990> got<00:01:25.020> a

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
highest rate possible but they've got a

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.640 
highest rate possible but they've got a
lot<00:01:25.350> of<00:01:25.409> scores<00:01:25.740> they<00:01:26.130> are<00:01:26.670> sharing<00:01:27.060> the<00:01:27.150> ball

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:27.650 
lot of scores they are sharing the ball

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:30.319 
lot of scores they are sharing the ball
it's<00:01:28.650> hard<00:01:28.950> to<00:01:29.040> just<00:01:29.700> to<00:01:29.880> playing<00:01:30.150> without

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
it's hard to just to playing without

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.710 
it's hard to just to playing without
Chandler<00:01:30.960> initially<00:01:31.530> they've<00:01:31.799> done<00:01:32.040> that<00:01:32.220> now

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:32.720 
Chandler initially they've done that now

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:34.999 
Chandler initially they've done that now
they're<00:01:33.720> playing<00:01:33.840> Bargnani<00:01:34.470> at<00:01:34.650> the<00:01:34.770> five<00:01:34.979> a

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
they're playing Bargnani at the five a

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.330 
they're playing Bargnani at the five a
lot<00:01:35.400> and<00:01:35.729> that's<00:01:36.150> a<00:01:36.270> problem<00:01:36.380> so<00:01:37.380> seems<00:01:38.280> like

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
lot and that's a problem so seems like

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.679 
lot and that's a problem so seems like
they've<00:01:38.640> found<00:01:38.820> their<00:01:39.000> way<00:01:39.150> and<00:01:39.329> when<00:01:39.600> they

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
they've found their way and when they

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.120 
they've found their way and when they
were<00:01:39.750> losing<00:01:39.930> they<00:01:40.200> weren't<00:01:40.439> losing<00:01:40.590> by<00:01:40.860> a<00:01:40.890> lot

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
were losing they weren't losing by a lot

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.260 
were losing they weren't losing by a lot
they<00:01:41.430> were<00:01:41.520> losing<00:01:41.640> a<00:01:41.850> lot<00:01:41.939> of<00:01:42.000> close<00:01:42.240> games

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
they were losing a lot of close games

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.069 
they were losing a lot of close games
against<00:01:43.020> good<00:01:43.170> teams<00:01:43.409> so<00:01:43.820> to<00:01:44.820> me<00:01:45.119> you<00:01:45.360> know<00:01:46.049> I

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:55.040 
seen a difference in mellows game the
last<00:02:51.420> two<00:02:52.070> um<00:02:53.070> I<00:02:53.970> mean<00:02:54.420> same<00:02:54.720> thing<00:02:54.900> I<00:02:55.020> just

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050 
last two um I mean same thing I just

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:57.830 
last two um I mean same thing I just
said<00:02:55.260> as<00:02:55.620> far<00:02:55.680> as<00:02:56.010> little<00:02:56.610> you<00:02:56.910> know<00:02:57.030> he's<00:02:57.239> he

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
said as far as little you know he's he

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.120 
said as far as little you know he's he
hasn't<00:02:58.380> been<00:02:58.470> in<00:02:58.530> at<00:02:58.739> the<00:02:58.830> end<00:02:58.920> of<00:02:59.010> the<00:02:59.100> game

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
hasn't been in at the end of the game

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:01.420 
hasn't been in at the end of the game
because<00:02:59.370> they've<00:02:59.580> been<00:02:59.610> winning<00:02:59.820> by<00:03:00.060> so<00:03:00.239> much

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430 
because they've been winning by so much

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:04.220 
because they've been winning by so much
I've<00:03:02.430> always<00:03:02.700> been<00:03:02.940> a<00:03:03.000> Carmelo<00:03:03.420> fan<00:03:03.720> last<00:03:04.019> year

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
I've always been a Carmelo fan last year

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:05.960 
I've always been a Carmelo fan last year
I<00:03:04.260> saw<00:03:04.500> him<00:03:04.620> play<00:03:04.769> live<00:03:05.010> once<00:03:05.310> and<00:03:05.400> he<00:03:05.519> had<00:03:05.640> 42

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
I saw him play live once and he had 42

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.920 
I saw him play live once and he had 42
at<00:03:06.239> Atlanta<00:03:06.660> and<00:03:07.650> he<00:03:08.010> didn't<00:03:08.310> look<00:03:08.430> stoppable

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
at Atlanta and he didn't look stoppable

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:12.290 
at Atlanta and he didn't look stoppable
and<00:03:09.930> so<00:03:10.260> I<00:03:10.500> think<00:03:11.459> it's<00:03:11.760> a<00:03:11.850> really<00:03:12.000> difficult

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:12.300 
and so I think it's a really difficult

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.539 
and so I think it's a really difficult
challenge<00:03:13.019> I<00:03:13.170> think<00:03:13.380> you<00:03:13.769> know<00:03:13.890> he's<00:03:14.070> one<00:03:14.280> of<00:03:14.430> a

00:03:14.539 --> 00:03:14.549 
challenge I think you know he's one of a

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:16.370 
challenge I think you know he's one of a
few<00:03:14.820> a<00:03:14.880> handful<00:03:15.480> of<00:03:15.540> players<00:03:15.840> in<00:03:16.110> the<00:03:16.200> league

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.380 
few a handful of players in the league

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:18.860 
few a handful of players in the league
that<00:03:16.440> you<00:03:16.709> go<00:03:16.860> into<00:03:17.070> the<00:03:17.190> game<00:03:17.480> knowing<00:03:18.480> that

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
that you go into the game knowing that

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:20.420 
that you go into the game knowing that
you're<00:03:19.170> probably<00:03:19.410> going<00:03:19.680> to<00:03:19.769> have<00:03:19.890> to<00:03:19.950> put<00:03:20.280> two

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
you're probably going to have to put two

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.850 
you're probably going to have to put two
guys<00:03:20.610> on<00:03:20.670> him<00:03:21.030> at<00:03:21.120> some<00:03:21.299> point<00:03:21.540> or<00:03:22.530> bring

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:22.860 
guys on him at some point or bring

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:25.210 
guys on him at some point or bring
another<00:03:23.100> guy<00:03:23.280> to<00:03:23.310> him<00:03:23.670> at<00:03:23.790> some<00:03:23.970> point<00:03:24.239> but<00:03:25.080> uh

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220 
another guy to him at some point but uh

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:27.590 
another guy to him at some point but uh
you<00:03:26.220> know<00:03:26.340> I<00:03:26.580> don't<00:03:26.880> see<00:03:27.209> a<00:03:27.239> huge<00:03:27.570> difference

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.600 
you know I don't see a huge difference

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.780 
you know I don't see a huge difference
no<00:03:28.200> I<00:03:28.230> just<00:03:28.530> think<00:03:28.650> he's<00:03:28.830> he's<00:03:29.370> a<00:03:29.400> really<00:03:29.670> good

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
no I just think he's he's a really good
