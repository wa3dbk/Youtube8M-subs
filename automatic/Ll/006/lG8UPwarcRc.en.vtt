00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:40.660 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:45.760 

you<00:01:41.660> really<00:01:41.900> have<00:01:41.990> to<00:01:43.930> hammer<00:01:44.930> on<00:01:45.110> it<00:01:45.350> up<00:01:45.530> so

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
notes per string diatonic scale so we're

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.550 
notes per string diatonic scale so we're
really<00:02:18.680> in<00:02:18.830> the<00:02:18.920> key<00:02:19.130> of<00:02:19.160> like<00:02:19.400> C<00:02:19.610> major<00:02:20.560> okay

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
really in the key of like C major okay

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.190 
really in the key of like C major okay
but<00:02:22.070> I'm<00:02:22.190> starting<00:02:22.580> on<00:02:22.850> a<00:02:22.880> B<00:02:23.120> note<00:02:23.390> okay<00:02:23.810> 7th

12 and one more eight ten twelve so I
love<00:02:59.750> this<00:02:59.900> pattern<00:03:00.110> very<00:03:00.500> symmetrical<00:03:01.160> it's

00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:01.459 
love this pattern very symmetrical it's

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:03.670 
love this pattern very symmetrical it's
you<00:03:02.300> know<00:03:02.420> every<00:03:02.720> group<00:03:02.959> of<00:03:03.110> two<00:03:03.230> strengths<00:03:03.650> of

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 
you know every group of two strengths of

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:06.040 
you know every group of two strengths of
the<00:03:03.800> same<00:03:03.980> pattern<00:03:04.370> seven<00:03:05.270> eight<00:03:05.360> ten<00:03:05.570> seven

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:06.050 
the same pattern seven eight ten seven

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:11.890 
the same pattern seven eight ten seven
eight<00:03:06.560> and<00:03:06.760> then<00:03:07.760> 7<00:03:08.090> 9<00:03:08.209> 10<00:03:08.450> 7<00:03:08.780> 9<00:03:08.900> 10<00:03:10.030> 10<00:03:11.030> or<00:03:11.330> 8<00:03:11.660> 10

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
eight and then 7 9 10 7 9 10 10 or 8 10

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:15.610 
eight and then 7 9 10 7 9 10 10 or 8 10
12<00:03:12.580> ok<00:03:13.580> so<00:03:14.239> this<00:03:14.510> is<00:03:14.630> a<00:03:14.660> descending<00:03:15.200> pattern<00:03:15.530> so

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
12 ok so this is a descending pattern so

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:16.900 
12 ok so this is a descending pattern so
we're<00:03:15.709> going<00:03:15.800> to<00:03:15.890> start<00:03:15.920> on<00:03:16.160> the<00:03:16.250> top<00:03:16.280> and<00:03:16.760> I'll

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:16.910 
we're going to start on the top and I'll

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:19.810 
we're going to start on the top and I'll
just<00:03:17.090> take<00:03:17.239> the<00:03:17.450> first<00:03:17.750> note<00:03:18.489> which<00:03:19.489> is<00:03:19.640> this

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:19.820 
just take the first note which is this

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:25.240 
just take the first note which is this
8th<00:03:20.060> fret<00:03:20.480> keistering<00:03:23.380> so<00:03:24.380> put<00:03:24.560> up<00:03:24.739> the<00:03:24.980> string

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.250 
8th fret keistering so put up the string

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:30.580 
8th fret keistering so put up the string
back<00:03:28.120> and<00:03:29.120> then<00:03:29.330> that's<00:03:30.050> kind<00:03:30.380> of<00:03:30.410> what<00:03:30.560> I

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:30.590 
back and then that's kind of what I

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:31.840 
back and then that's kind of what I
talked<00:03:30.860> about<00:03:30.950> the<00:03:31.280> second<00:03:31.580> video<00:03:31.670> is

we're<00:03:46.720> gonna<00:03:46.810> go

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:49.170

string

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:09.930 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:13.030 

we're<00:04:10.590> going<00:04:10.829> we're<00:04:11.579> hammering<00:04:11.760> on<00:04:12.000> to<00:04:12.209> it

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:13.040 
we're going we're hammering on to it

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:15.410 
we're going we're hammering on to it
walking<00:04:14.040> down<00:04:14.069> the<00:04:14.430> street<00:04:14.730> walking<00:04:15.209> back<00:04:15.390> up

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:15.420 
walking down the street walking back up

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:17.569 
walking down the street walking back up
and<00:04:15.930> then<00:04:16.049> down<00:04:16.259> from<00:04:16.500> our<00:04:16.650> time<00:04:16.829> the<00:04:17.430> only

00:04:17.569 --> 00:04:17.579 
and then down from our time the only

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:18.740 
and then down from our time the only
three<00:04:17.850> we<00:04:17.970> don't<00:04:18.120> do<00:04:18.209> that<00:04:18.329> as<00:04:18.449> the<00:04:18.570> highest

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
three we don't do that as the highest

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:22.820 
three we don't do that as the highest
string<00:04:19.639> because<00:04:20.639> we<00:04:20.759> start<00:04:21.000> here<00:04:21.650> you<00:04:22.650> could

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:22.830 
string because we start here you could

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:28.760 
string because we start here you could
start<00:04:23.220> here<00:04:23.430> if<00:04:23.520> you<00:04:23.580> want<00:04:26.449> but<00:04:27.449> whatever<00:04:28.410> all

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:28.770 
start here if you want but whatever all

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:32.840 
start here if you want but whatever all
right<00:04:28.919> so<00:04:31.190> so<00:04:32.190> let<00:04:32.280> me<00:04:32.340> just<00:04:32.490> do<00:04:32.580> the<00:04:32.699> whole

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:32.850 
right so so let me just do the whole

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:35.260 
right so so let me just do the whole
thing<00:04:32.880> really<00:04:33.300> super<00:04:34.020> super<00:04:34.380> slow<00:04:34.650> and

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:35.270 
thing really super super slow and

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:37.520 
thing really super super slow and
hopefully<00:04:36.270> I<00:04:36.449> won't<00:04:36.600> mess<00:04:36.780> it<00:04:36.810> up<00:04:37.020> good<00:04:37.289> that's

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:37.530 
hopefully I won't mess it up good that's

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:51.420 
hopefully I won't mess it up good that's
low<00:04:37.800> you<00:04:38.699> get<00:04:38.880> the<00:04:38.970> idea

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:51.430 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:05:02.210 

look

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:02.220 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:04.770 

so<00:05:03.220> if<00:05:03.280> I<00:05:03.370> hand<00:05:03.580> was<00:05:03.730> in<00:05:03.850> the<00:05:03.880> way<00:05:03.970> there<00:05:04.300> when<00:05:04.750> I

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:04.780 
so if I hand was in the way there when I

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:06.960 
so if I hand was in the way there when I
messed<00:05:04.990> that<00:05:05.110> up<00:05:05.610> you<00:05:06.610> want<00:05:06.760> to<00:05:06.820> make<00:05:06.940> sure

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:06.970 
messed that up you want to make sure

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:12.580 
messed that up you want to make sure
that

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:12.590 

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:14.659 

it's<00:05:13.590> actually<00:05:13.680> a<00:05:13.889> very<00:05:14.039> subtle<00:05:14.340> thing

00:05:14.659 --> 00:05:14.669 
it's actually a very subtle thing

00:05:14.669 --> 00:05:18.230 
it's actually a very subtle thing
because<00:05:15.030> i<00:05:15.590> don't<00:05:16.590> want<00:05:16.650> i<00:05:17.100> want<00:05:17.819> to<00:05:17.910> let<00:05:18.090> the

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:18.240 
because i don't want i want to let the

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:20.870 
because i don't want i want to let the
strings<00:05:18.539> ring<00:05:18.750> open<00:05:19.050> i'm<00:05:19.169> playing<00:05:19.819> but<00:05:20.819> i

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:20.880 
strings ring open i'm playing but i

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:27.610 
strings ring open i'm playing but i
don't<00:05:21.060> want<00:05:21.180> the<00:05:21.270> other<00:05:21.509> streams<00:05:21.960> to<00:05:22.139> ring<00:05:22.319> out
