we're<00:00:02.010> setting<00:00:02.460> up<00:00:02.580> our<00:00:03.110> shaper<00:00:04.110> vise<00:00:04.549> it's

00:00:05.539 --> 00:00:05.549 
we're setting up our shaper vise it's

we're setting up our shaper vise it's
already<00:00:06.000> set<00:00:06.270> up<00:00:06.299> but<00:00:06.690> I<00:00:07.500> was<00:00:07.770> going<00:00:07.919> to<00:00:08.010> talk

about how I generally do it this is a

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:17.029 
about how I generally do it this is a
surface<00:00:11.790> gage<00:00:12.059> a<00:00:13.820> medium<00:00:14.820> size<00:00:15.740> this<00:00:16.740> would<00:00:16.890> be

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
surface gage a medium size this would be

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:22.099 
surface gage a medium size this would be
a<00:00:17.070> large<00:00:17.369> stearic<00:00:18.119> surface<00:00:18.900> gage<00:00:20.869> these<00:00:21.869> have

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
a large stearic surface gage these have

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.910 
a large stearic surface gage these have
pins<00:00:23.510> front<00:00:24.510> and<00:00:24.660> back<00:00:24.840> the<00:00:25.260> large<00:00:25.529> and<00:00:25.859> the

pins front and back the large and the
mediums<00:00:26.310> that<00:00:26.430> you<00:00:27.330> can<00:00:27.630> push<00:00:27.840> down<00:00:28.140> and<00:00:28.500> bear

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
mediums that you can push down and bear

mediums that you can push down and bear
across<00:00:29.609> an<00:00:29.849> edge<00:00:31.759> and<00:00:32.759> they<00:00:33.059> also<00:00:33.239> come<00:00:33.540> in

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
across an edge and they also come in

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
fine so I can slide this my little test

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.840 
fine so I can slide this my little test
indicator<00:00:50.940> and<00:00:51.180> I've<00:00:51.270> got<00:00:51.480> it<00:00:51.629> sitting<00:00:51.870> just

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:52.850 
indicator and I've got it sitting just

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:55.970 
indicator and I've got it sitting just
there<00:00:53.850> on<00:00:54.180> 10<00:00:54.629> just<00:00:54.870> barely<00:00:55.199> touching<00:00:55.710> because

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
there on 10 just barely touching because

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.360 
there on 10 just barely touching because
if<00:00:56.129> you<00:00:56.250> go<00:00:56.399> across<00:00:56.520> bumps<00:00:57.890> it'll<00:00:58.890> do<00:00:59.010> strange

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
if you go across bumps it'll do strange

if you go across bumps it'll do strange
things<00:01:00.320> so<00:01:01.320> I<00:01:01.350> see<00:01:01.649> the<00:01:01.800> front<00:01:02.070> of<00:01:02.129> my<00:01:02.250> jaw<00:01:02.989> is

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
things so I see the front of my jaw is

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.380 
things so I see the front of my jaw is
there<00:01:04.650> and<00:01:04.890> you<00:01:04.949> can<00:01:05.070> also<00:01:05.250> just<00:01:05.640> lift<00:01:06.060> it<00:01:06.240> up

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
there and you can also just lift it up

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
to remember when you've got weight to

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.880 
to remember when you've got weight to
keep<00:01:11.390> weight<00:01:12.390> on<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:12.689> back<00:01:12.869> of<00:01:13.080> your<00:01:13.290> surface

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
keep weight on the back of your surface

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:21.010 
keep weight on the back of your surface
gage

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:21.020 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:25.090 

must<00:01:21.620> have<00:01:21.770> a<00:01:21.890> bird<00:01:22.160> on<00:01:22.370> there<00:01:23.680> and<00:01:24.680> it's<00:01:24.890> still

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.100 
must have a bird on there and it's still

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:29.140 
must have a bird on there and it's still
sitting<00:01:25.490> on<00:01:25.580> ten<00:01:25.910> there<00:01:26.980> and<00:01:27.980> still<00:01:28.700> sitting

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:29.150 
sitting on ten there and still sitting

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:32.650 
sitting on ten there and still sitting
on<00:01:29.270> ten<00:01:29.630> there<00:01:30.370> see<00:01:31.370> if<00:01:31.460> I<00:01:31.610> can<00:01:31.850> zoom<00:01:31.880> this<00:01:32.390> in<00:01:32.600> a

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:32.660 
on ten there see if I can zoom this in a

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:42.730 
on ten there see if I can zoom this in a
little<00:01:32.810> bit<00:01:34.570> and<00:01:39.310> maybe<00:01:40.310> you<00:01:40.550> can<00:01:40.729> see<00:01:40.970> it<00:01:41.740> go

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:42.740 
little bit and maybe you can see it go

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:48.190 
little bit and maybe you can see it go
wide<00:01:43.390> yeah<00:01:45.460> so<00:01:46.460> I<00:01:46.490> have<00:01:46.790> my<00:01:46.970> vise<00:01:47.210> right<00:01:47.810> this

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:48.200 
wide yeah so I have my vise right this

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.170 
wide yeah so I have my vise right this
way

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:49.180

on these machines this is a tool room
shaper<00:01:54.790> let<00:01:55.790> me<00:01:55.910> get<00:01:56.090> my<00:01:57.009> surface<00:01:58.009> gauge<00:01:58.250> out

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490 
shaper let me get my surface gauge out

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:01.170 
shaper let me get my surface gauge out
of<00:01:58.550> the<00:01:58.640> way<00:01:58.759> here<00:01:59.090> a<00:01:59.270> little<00:01:59.600> bitty<00:01:59.780> one

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:01.180 
of the way here a little bitty one

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:03.520 
of the way here a little bitty one
put<00:02:02.180> the<00:02:02.300> starett<00:02:02.690> where<00:02:02.930> it's<00:02:03.080> not<00:02:03.229> going<00:02:03.440> to

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:03.530 
put the starett where it's not going to

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:11.949 
put the starett where it's not going to
get<00:02:03.680> in<00:02:03.770> trouble<00:02:07.300> the<00:02:08.300> table<00:02:08.750> rotates<00:02:10.780> to<00:02:11.780> any

00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:11.959 
get in trouble the table rotates to any

angle you want and getting it back to
zero<00:02:16.459> sometimes<00:02:17.090> can<00:02:17.330> be<00:02:17.450> a<00:02:17.480> Papa<00:02:17.810> Bear<00:02:17.959> and<00:02:20.140> I

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
zero sometimes can be a Papa Bear and I

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:33.860 
zero sometimes can be a Papa Bear and I
will<00:02:21.320> set<00:02:21.560> an<00:02:21.680> indicator<00:02:22.130> up<00:02:22.370> like<00:02:22.610> this

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:43.420 

you<00:02:34.470> can<00:02:34.650> adjust<00:02:34.769> the<00:02:35.220> table

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:46.000 

with<00:02:44.000> a<00:02:44.030> support<00:02:44.569> foot<00:02:44.900> that's<00:02:45.379> out<00:02:45.590> in<00:02:45.739> front

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
with a support foot that's out in front

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.039 
with a support foot that's out in front
underneath<00:02:46.370> the<00:02:46.760> table<00:02:47.599> here

underneath the table here

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:50.740 
underneath the table here
I<00:02:48.079> usually<00:02:48.920> don't<00:02:49.310> unlock<00:02:49.909> the<00:02:50.120> table<00:02:50.510> and<00:02:50.689> I

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
I usually don't unlock the table and I

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.710 
I usually don't unlock the table and I
just<00:02:50.780> drop<00:02:51.230> the<00:02:51.379> support<00:02:51.799> foot<00:02:52.040> and<00:02:52.579> if<00:02:53.360> I<00:02:53.510> need

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 
just drop the support foot and if I need

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.710 
just drop the support foot and if I need
to<00:02:53.870> shim<00:02:54.140> I'll<00:02:55.069> use<00:02:55.400> a<00:02:55.430> cigarette<00:02:56.180> paper<00:02:56.450> or

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720 
to shim I'll use a cigarette paper or

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:58.059 
to shim I'll use a cigarette paper or
something<00:02:56.930> underneath<00:02:57.349> the<00:02:57.500> piece<00:02:57.709> if<00:02:57.890> I'm

00:02:58.059 --> 00:02:58.069 
something underneath the piece if I'm

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:00.670 
something underneath the piece if I'm
cutting<00:02:58.370> a<00:02:58.430> long<00:02:58.610> piece<00:02:58.939> and<00:02:59.200> it's<00:03:00.200> not<00:03:00.409> hard

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
cutting a long piece and it's not hard

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:01.990 
cutting a long piece and it's not hard
to<00:03:00.799> work<00:03:00.829> -<00:03:01.129> better<00:03:01.340> than<00:03:01.489> a<00:03:01.670> half<00:03:01.879> of

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
to work - better than a half of

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.259 
to work - better than a half of
thousands<00:03:03.040> you<00:03:04.040> traverse<00:03:04.370> the<00:03:04.730> table<00:03:05.060> this

00:03:05.259 --> 00:03:05.269 
thousands you traverse the table this

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:10.479 
thousands you traverse the table this
way<00:03:05.569> I've<00:03:05.840> already<00:03:06.049> done<00:03:06.349> it<00:03:06.519> and<00:03:08.049> that<00:03:09.370> is<00:03:10.370> how

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:10.489 
way I've already done it and that is how

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:13.630 
way I've already done it and that is how
you<00:03:10.579> get<00:03:10.849> the<00:03:11.030> table<00:03:11.239> rotation<00:03:12.049> back<00:03:12.950> to<00:03:13.250> zero

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:13.640 
you get the table rotation back to zero

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:17.680 
you get the table rotation back to zero
and<00:03:14.409> it's<00:03:15.409> a<00:03:15.500> pretty<00:03:15.739> easy<00:03:15.950> setup<00:03:16.540> one<00:03:17.540> thing

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:17.690 
and it's a pretty easy setup one thing

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:19.059 
and it's a pretty easy setup one thing
you<00:03:17.810> do<00:03:17.959> have<00:03:18.170> to<00:03:18.349> remember<00:03:18.769> when<00:03:18.950> you're

00:03:19.059 --> 00:03:19.069 
you do have to remember when you're

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:21.490 
you do have to remember when you're
using<00:03:19.340> a<00:03:19.609> dial<00:03:20.000> indicator<00:03:20.209> like<00:03:20.840> this<00:03:21.200> a

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:21.500 
using a dial indicator like this a

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:24.970 
using a dial indicator like this a
travel<00:03:22.340> indicator<00:03:23.379> make<00:03:24.379> sure<00:03:24.650> that<00:03:24.799> it's

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:24.980 
travel indicator make sure that it's

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:28.750 
travel indicator make sure that it's
square<00:03:25.220> this<00:03:26.090> way<00:03:26.299> and<00:03:26.739> this<00:03:27.739> way<00:03:27.980> so<00:03:28.489> that<00:03:28.639> you

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:28.760 
square this way and this way so that you

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:31.119 
square this way and this way so that you
don't<00:03:28.939> have<00:03:29.150> tangent<00:03:29.689> error<00:03:29.980> when<00:03:30.980> you're

00:03:31.119 --> 00:03:31.129 
don't have tangent error when you're

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:36.300 
don't have tangent error when you're
reading<00:03:31.420> if<00:03:32.420> you<00:03:32.540> get<00:03:32.720> the<00:03:32.900> dial<00:03:33.139> indicator

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:36.310 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:41.410 

often<00:03:37.310> like<00:03:37.790> this<00:03:38.060> direction<00:03:40.180> that's<00:03:41.180> going

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:41.420 
often like this direction that's going

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:44.280 
often like this direction that's going
to<00:03:41.480> give<00:03:41.629> you<00:03:41.780> a<00:03:41.810> tangent<00:03:42.290> error<00:03:42.470> probably

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.290 
to give you a tangent error probably

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:47.020 
to give you a tangent error probably
that<00:03:45.290> looks<00:03:45.530> to<00:03:45.650> be<00:03:45.680> about<00:03:45.889> fifteen<00:03:46.579> or<00:03:46.760> twenty

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:47.030 
that looks to be about fifteen or twenty

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:51.309 
that looks to be about fifteen or twenty
degrees<00:03:48.579> and<00:03:49.579> you<00:03:50.389> can<00:03:50.419> figure<00:03:50.780> out<00:03:50.870> the<00:03:51.169> ratio

00:03:51.309 --> 00:03:51.319 
degrees and you can figure out the ratio

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:53.979 
degrees and you can figure out the ratio
just<00:03:51.799> by<00:03:51.919> using<00:03:52.129> the<00:03:52.370> tangent<00:03:52.579> function<00:03:52.989> it'll

00:03:53.979 --> 00:03:53.989 
just by using the tangent function it'll

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:55.689 
just by using the tangent function it'll
say<00:03:54.230> you've<00:03:54.440> got<00:03:54.590> a<00:03:54.620> thousand<00:03:55.190> so<00:03:55.310> it's<00:03:55.459> really

00:03:55.689 --> 00:03:55.699 
say you've got a thousand so it's really

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:58.089 
say you've got a thousand so it's really
more<00:03:56.030> like<00:03:56.180> a<00:03:56.209> thousand<00:03:56.780> some<00:03:56.989> three<00:03:57.769> or<00:03:57.889> four

00:03:58.089 --> 00:03:58.099 
more like a thousand some three or four

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:04.000 
more like a thousand some three or four
tenths<00:04:01.720> so<00:04:02.720> those<00:04:02.900> are<00:04:03.109> the<00:04:03.169> tools<00:04:03.349> I<00:04:03.620> used<00:04:03.889> to

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.010 
tenths so those are the tools I used to

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:06.879 
tenths so those are the tools I used to
set<00:04:04.220> the<00:04:04.370> shaper<00:04:04.609> up
