00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
is actually the demo version that we had

pre-production and on the machine we've

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.360

technology<00:00:36.200> really<00:00:37.200> growing<00:00:37.620> here<00:00:37.860> in

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
technology really growing here in

we<00:00:40.290> have<00:00:40.410> seen<00:00:40.590> a<00:00:40.649> lot<00:00:40.890> of<00:00:41.010> complications<00:00:41.760> with

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
we have seen a lot of complications with

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.639 
we have seen a lot of complications with
the<00:00:42.149> technology<00:00:42.660> as<00:00:42.780> far<00:00:43.020> as<00:00:43.110> it<00:00:43.230> not<00:00:43.379> being

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
the technology as far as it not being

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.940 
the technology as far as it not being
very<00:00:43.860> simple<00:00:44.430> with<00:00:45.239> the<00:00:45.390> Sprinter<00:00:45.809> we're<00:00:46.710> not

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
very simple with the Sprinter we're not

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.940 
very simple with the Sprinter we're not
going<00:00:47.309> in<00:00:47.489> and<00:00:47.700> using<00:00:48.410> individual<00:00:49.410> cylinders

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
going in and using individual cylinders

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.220 
going in and using individual cylinders
on<00:00:50.129> every<00:00:50.399> shank<00:00:50.730> what<00:00:51.390> we're<00:00:51.539> doing<00:00:51.809> here<00:00:52.079> is

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
on every shank what we're doing here is

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.560 
on every shank what we're doing here is
is<00:00:52.440> we've<00:00:52.590> got<00:00:52.800> actually<00:00:53.340> two<00:00:53.640> cylinders<00:00:54.360> per

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
is we've got actually two cylinders per

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.020 
is we've got actually two cylinders per
wing<00:00:54.780> that<00:00:55.530> connect<00:00:56.219> to<00:00:56.280> a<00:00:56.340> connecting<00:00:56.850> bar

openers into the ground and on each

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.770 
openers into the ground and on each
opener<00:01:02.190> we<00:01:02.309> have<00:01:02.489> a<00:01:02.520> torsion<00:01:03.030> bar<00:01:03.059> that<00:01:03.510> rolls

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
opener we have a torsion bar that rolls

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.960 
opener we have a torsion bar that rolls
with<00:01:04.170> that<00:01:04.409> rock<00:01:04.619> shaft<00:01:04.949> that<00:01:05.549> will<00:01:05.670> help<00:01:05.790> hold

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
with that rock shaft that will help hold

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.880 
with that rock shaft that will help hold
the<00:01:06.119> openers<00:01:06.510> in<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:06.689> ground<00:01:06.930> but<00:01:07.380> still<00:01:07.710> have

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
the openers in the ground but still have

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.859 
the openers in the ground but still have
the<00:01:08.040> independent<00:01:08.549> characteristics<00:01:09.240> that<00:01:09.720> you

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
the independent characteristics that you

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.179 
the independent characteristics that you
would<00:01:09.960> need<00:01:10.080> for<00:01:10.140> terrain<00:01:10.590> falling<00:01:11.040> when

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
would need for terrain falling when

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:12.320 
would need for terrain falling when
you're<00:01:11.310> planning<00:01:11.549> say<00:01:11.729> like<00:01:11.880> canola<00:01:12.180> or

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
you're planning say like canola or

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.050 
you're planning say like canola or
lentils<00:01:13.040> so<00:01:14.040> this<00:01:14.310> machine<00:01:14.490> right<00:01:14.790> here<00:01:14.820> is<00:01:15.030> a

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
lentils so this machine right here is a

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.980 
lentils so this machine right here is a

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
independent depth control machines would

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.330 
independent depth control machines would
use<00:01:20.820> 64<00:01:21.390> cylinders<00:01:21.900> for<00:01:22.140> this<00:01:22.290> this<00:01:22.950> type<00:01:23.130> of<00:01:23.159> a

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
use 64 cylinders for this this type of a

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.929 
use 64 cylinders for this this type of a

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
with that our response time is a lot

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.410 
with that our response time is a lot
better<00:01:29.130> in<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:29.400> field<00:01:29.640> when<00:01:29.880> it<00:01:29.909> comes<00:01:30.180> to
