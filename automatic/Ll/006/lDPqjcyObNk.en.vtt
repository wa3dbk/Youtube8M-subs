was<00:00:47.090> I<00:00:47.329> took<00:00:47.540> the<00:00:47.690> lace<00:00:47.900> and<00:00:48.520> I<00:00:49.750> glue<00:00:50.750> it<00:00:50.780> around

00:00:51.369 --> 00:00:51.379 
was I took the lace and I glue it around

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:54.430 
was I took the lace and I glue it around
it<00:00:51.650> but<00:00:51.800> only<00:00:52.040> go<00:00:52.640> around<00:00:53.089> the<00:00:53.360> edge<00:00:53.570> that<00:00:53.989> way

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:54.440 
it but only go around the edge that way

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.290 
it but only go around the edge that way
is<00:00:54.589> not<00:00:54.739> going<00:00:54.980> to<00:00:55.040> be<00:00:55.160> moving<00:00:55.610> and<00:00:55.879> you<00:00:56.120> guys

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:56.300 
is not going to be moving and you guys

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.509 
is not going to be moving and you guys
will<00:00:56.570> not<00:00:56.780> have<00:00:57.050> a<00:00:57.320> lot<00:00:57.500> of<00:00:57.559> mistakes<00:00:58.190> when

00:00:58.509 --> 00:00:58.519 
will not have a lot of mistakes when

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:04.899 
will not have a lot of mistakes when
you're<00:00:58.750> gluing<00:00:59.750> on<00:01:00.160> the<00:01:01.160> lace<00:01:01.400> to<00:01:01.640> the<00:01:01.940> cup<00:01:03.909> so

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:04.909 
you're gluing on the lace to the cup so

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:07.029 
you're gluing on the lace to the cup so
then<00:01:05.089> cut<00:01:05.300> it<00:01:05.390> like<00:01:05.540> an<00:01:05.750> ass<00:01:05.990> exact<00:01:06.470> shape<00:01:06.800> like

00:01:07.029 --> 00:01:07.039 
then cut it like an ass exact shape like

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:08.109 
then cut it like an ass exact shape like
I'm<00:01:07.190> doing<00:01:07.460> it<00:01:07.580> right<00:01:07.700> now

00:01:08.109 --> 00:01:08.119 
I'm doing it right now

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:10.450 
I'm doing it right now
and<00:01:08.869> that<00:01:09.050> is<00:01:09.200> just<00:01:09.380> going<00:01:09.530> to<00:01:09.619> help<00:01:09.860> us<00:01:10.070> to

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:10.460 
and that is just going to help us to

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:12.520 
and that is just going to help us to
give<00:01:10.729> a<00:01:10.970> beautiful<00:01:11.330> rounded<00:01:12.050> shape<00:01:12.289> to<00:01:12.470> our

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:12.530 
give a beautiful rounded shape to our

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:15.190 
give a beautiful rounded shape to our
cup<00:01:13.090> make<00:01:14.090> sure<00:01:14.300> that<00:01:14.479> you<00:01:14.600> leave<00:01:14.810> a<00:01:15.020> little

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:15.200 
cup make sure that you leave a little

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.249 
cup make sure that you leave a little
bit<00:01:15.350> of<00:01:15.410> fabric<00:01:15.740> to<00:01:16.130> cover<00:01:16.310> just<00:01:16.910> a<00:01:17.090> tiny<00:01:17.479> part

00:01:18.249 --> 00:01:18.259 
bit of fabric to cover just a tiny part

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:21.730 
bit of fabric to cover just a tiny part
of<00:01:18.560> the<00:01:18.890> handle<00:01:19.340> and<00:01:20.020> don't<00:01:21.020> try<00:01:21.140> to<00:01:21.200> cut<00:01:21.440> too

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:21.740 
of the handle and don't try to cut too

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:23.740 
of the handle and don't try to cut too
much<00:01:21.770> otherwise<00:01:22.610> it's<00:01:23.060> going<00:01:23.240> to<00:01:23.300> very

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:23.750 
much otherwise it's going to very

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:25.389 
much otherwise it's going to very
awkward<00:01:24.170> so<00:01:24.380> just<00:01:24.680> do<00:01:24.770> it<00:01:24.890> like<00:01:25.009> I'm<00:01:25.190> showing

00:01:25.389 --> 00:01:25.399 
awkward so just do it like I'm showing

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:27.880 
awkward so just do it like I'm showing
you<00:01:25.580> in<00:01:25.700> the<00:01:25.789> picture<00:01:26.119> or<00:01:26.300> in<00:01:26.960> the<00:01:27.560> actual

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:27.890 
you in the picture or in the actual

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:30.700 
you in the picture or in the actual
video

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:30.710 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:33.300 

so<00:01:31.280> then<00:01:31.490> I'm<00:01:31.610> just<00:01:31.640> cutting<00:01:32.060> some<00:01:32.450> pieces<00:01:32.720> and

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:33.310 
so then I'm just cutting some pieces and

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:36.190 
so then I'm just cutting some pieces and
that<00:01:34.310> is<00:01:34.460> just<00:01:34.610> going<00:01:34.730> to<00:01:34.940> make<00:01:35.150> sure<00:01:35.180> that<00:01:35.480> the

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:36.200 
that is just going to make sure that the

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.170 
that is just going to make sure that the
cup<00:01:36.410> looks<00:01:36.620> good<00:01:37.010> and<00:01:37.280> I'm<00:01:37.760> going<00:01:37.940> to<00:01:38.000> take

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:38.180 
cup looks good and I'm going to take

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:41.290 
cup looks good and I'm going to take
superglue<00:01:38.990> and<00:01:39.230> I'm<00:01:39.620> going<00:01:39.920> to<00:01:39.980> glue<00:01:40.130> the<00:01:41.030> lace

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:41.300 
superglue and I'm going to glue the lace

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.210 
superglue and I'm going to glue the lace
this<00:01:41.630> is<00:01:41.840> the<00:01:41.960> only<00:01:42.140> way<00:01:42.380> that<00:01:42.410> actually<00:01:42.770> you

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:43.220 
this is the only way that actually you

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:46.780 
this is the only way that actually you
can<00:01:43.460> glue<00:01:43.730> the<00:01:44.300> lace<00:01:44.570> to<00:01:44.960> glass<00:01:45.890> is<00:01:46.250> with

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:46.790 
can glue the lace to glass is with

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:49.060 
can glue the lace to glass is with
superglue<00:01:47.330> and<00:01:47.620> then<00:01:48.620> I'm<00:01:48.710> just<00:01:48.830> going<00:01:49.010> to

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:49.070 
superglue and then I'm just going to

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:50.620 
superglue and then I'm just going to
take<00:01:49.280> the<00:01:49.430> extra<00:01:49.790> that<00:01:50.120> doesn't<00:01:50.480> look<00:01:50.570> good

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.630 
take the extra that doesn't look good

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:55.010 
take the extra that doesn't look good
and<00:01:51.020> I'm<00:01:51.470> going<00:01:51.680> to<00:01:51.770> cut<00:01:52.010> it

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.319 

and<00:01:55.109> then<00:01:55.920> on<00:01:56.039> top<00:01:56.219> of<00:01:56.399> that<00:01:56.579> I'm<00:01:56.820> gonna<00:01:57.060> put

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
and then on top of that I'm gonna put

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.660 
and then on top of that I'm gonna put
superglue<00:01:57.689> and<00:01:58.170> that<00:01:58.799> is<00:01:58.920> going<00:01:59.159> to<00:01:59.219> help<00:01:59.429> us

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
superglue and that is going to help us

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.069 
superglue and that is going to help us
so<00:02:00.420> it's<00:02:01.200> not<00:02:01.350> gonna<00:02:01.649> break<00:02:01.979> or<00:02:02.399> is<00:02:03.299> not<00:02:03.570> even

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
so it's not gonna break or is not even

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:07.370 
so it's not gonna break or is not even
going<00:02:04.439> to<00:02:04.590> look<00:02:05.210> because<00:02:06.210> it's<00:02:06.960> not<00:02:07.170> going<00:02:07.289> to

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
going to look because it's not going to

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.499 
going to look because it's not going to
look<00:02:07.469> pretty<00:02:07.860> if<00:02:08.069> you<00:02:08.099> let<00:02:08.879> it<00:02:09.000> just<00:02:09.030> like<00:02:09.360> that

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
look pretty if you let it just like that

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.920 
look pretty if you let it just like that
so<00:02:09.690> just<00:02:09.720> glue<00:02:10.200> it<00:02:10.229> and<00:02:10.590> that<00:02:11.340> way<00:02:11.690> it's<00:02:12.690> going

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
so just glue it and that way it's going

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:14.539 
so just glue it and that way it's going
to<00:02:12.989> look<00:02:13.110> a<00:02:13.290> little<00:02:13.410> bit<00:02:13.620> more<00:02:13.830> natural<00:02:14.010> and

00:02:14.539 --> 00:02:14.549 
to look a little bit more natural and

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:15.949 
to look a little bit more natural and
it's<00:02:14.700> not<00:02:14.790> going<00:02:15.030> to<00:02:15.090> look<00:02:15.209> like<00:02:15.330> you<00:02:15.480> made<00:02:15.720> a

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
it's not going to look like you made a

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:18.050 
it's not going to look like you made a
mistake<00:02:16.620> or<00:02:16.830> anything<00:02:17.099> like<00:02:17.340> that<00:02:17.400> and<00:02:17.760> I<00:02:17.879> hope

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
mistake or anything like that and I hope

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.979 
mistake or anything like that and I hope
that<00:02:18.269> what<00:02:18.420> I'm<00:02:18.510> saying<00:02:18.750> is<00:02:18.989> making<00:02:19.410> sense

00:02:20.979 --> 00:02:20.989 
that what I'm saying is making sense

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:24.080 
that what I'm saying is making sense
sometimes<00:02:21.989> superglue<00:02:22.590> can<00:02:23.340> get<00:02:23.610> in<00:02:23.910> your

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
sometimes superglue can get in your

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.089 
sometimes superglue can get in your
fingers<00:02:24.540> so<00:02:25.080> try<00:02:25.290> to<00:02:25.349> do<00:02:25.530> it<00:02:25.650> with<00:02:25.830> another

00:02:26.089 --> 00:02:26.099 
fingers so try to do it with another

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:30.440 
fingers so try to do it with another
object<00:02:26.340> so<00:02:27.000> try<00:02:27.180> to<00:02:27.209> push<00:02:27.510> it<00:02:27.920> and<00:02:29.030> this<00:02:30.030> is<00:02:30.209> how

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
object so try to push it and this is how

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.199 
object so try to push it and this is how
the<00:02:31.290> cup<00:02:31.680> should<00:02:32.130> be<00:02:32.310> looking<00:02:32.670> now<00:02:32.790> and<00:02:33.000> of<00:02:33.090> you

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:33.209 
the cup should be looking now and of you

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:34.819 
the cup should be looking now and of you
get<00:02:33.390> as<00:02:33.540> you<00:02:33.720> guys<00:02:33.870> can<00:02:34.049> see<00:02:34.110> the<00:02:34.319> superglue

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:34.829 
get as you guys can see the superglue

00:02:34.829 --> 00:02:38.960 
get as you guys can see the superglue
that's<00:02:35.579> kind<00:02:35.910> of<00:02:35.970> like<00:02:37.010> these<00:02:38.010> effects<00:02:38.730> that

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
that's kind of like these effects that

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.160 
that's kind of like these effects that
you<00:02:39.569> it's<00:02:39.989> not<00:02:40.170> noticeable<00:02:41.040> where<00:02:41.579> you<00:02:41.730> caught

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
you it's not noticeable where you caught

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:44.330 
you it's not noticeable where you caught
so<00:02:43.170> now<00:02:43.349> I'm<00:02:43.500> going<00:02:43.650> to<00:02:43.709> start<00:02:43.950> adding<00:02:44.310> in

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
so now I'm going to start adding in

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.960 
so now I'm going to start adding in
super<00:02:44.819> glue<00:02:44.849> to<00:02:45.360> the<00:02:45.569> handle<00:02:45.989> and<00:02:46.200> that<00:02:46.970> way

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
super glue to the handle and that way

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:51.430 
super glue to the handle and that way
the<00:02:48.420> fabric<00:02:48.630> is<00:02:48.930> going<00:02:49.079> to<00:02:49.170> stay<00:02:49.230> in<00:02:49.500> place<00:02:49.709> so

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:51.440 
the fabric is going to stay in place so

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:53.660 
the fabric is going to stay in place so
this<00:02:52.440> is<00:02:52.560> how<00:02:52.709> everything<00:02:53.099> should<00:02:53.430> look<00:02:53.610> like

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
this is how everything should look like

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.369 
this is how everything should look like
and<00:02:54.120> I<00:02:54.180> made<00:02:54.390> a<00:02:54.420> little<00:02:54.660> mistake<00:02:54.870> right<00:02:55.319> there

00:02:55.369 --> 00:02:55.379 
and I made a little mistake right there

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:58.880 
and I made a little mistake right there
but<00:02:56.280> most<00:02:57.030> of<00:02:57.180> the<00:02:57.329> part<00:02:57.599> or<00:02:57.930> most<00:02:58.470> of<00:02:58.590> the<00:02:58.709> cup

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
but most of the part or most of the cup

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:01.099 
but most of the part or most of the cup
is<00:02:59.040> it's<00:02:59.280> looking<00:02:59.819> very<00:02:59.850> weird<00:03:00.329> very<00:03:00.630> pretty

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:01.109 
is it's looking very weird very pretty

00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:04.430 
is it's looking very weird very pretty
here<00:03:01.410> and<00:03:01.620> then<00:03:02.280> take<00:03:02.579> your<00:03:02.989> fat<00:03:03.989> a<00:03:04.019> piece<00:03:04.290> of

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
here and then take your fat a piece of

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.470 
here and then take your fat a piece of
fabric<00:03:04.620> that<00:03:04.980> you<00:03:05.130> guys<00:03:05.310> don't<00:03:05.579> care<00:03:05.730> if<00:03:06.000> it

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
fabric that you guys don't care if it

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.559 
fabric that you guys don't care if it
gets<00:03:06.690> ruin<00:03:07.109> or<00:03:07.230> not<00:03:07.440> I<00:03:07.739> took<00:03:08.310> a<00:03:08.579> skirt<00:03:09.060> of<00:03:09.269> mine

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:09.569 
gets ruin or not I took a skirt of mine

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:11.330 
gets ruin or not I took a skirt of mine
and<00:03:09.900> I<00:03:10.200> put<00:03:10.380> it<00:03:10.470> right<00:03:10.500> there<00:03:10.650> this<00:03:11.040> is<00:03:11.100> going

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
and I put it right there this is going

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.129 
and I put it right there this is going
to<00:03:11.430> help<00:03:11.609> so<00:03:11.819> the<00:03:11.940> cup<00:03:12.180> is<00:03:12.359> not<00:03:12.690> going<00:03:12.959> to<00:03:13.019> be

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:13.139 
to help so the cup is not going to be

00:03:13.139 --> 00:03:16.740 
to help so the cup is not going to be
moving<00:03:13.799> all<00:03:13.980> over<00:03:14.010> the<00:03:14.220> place

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:16.750 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:19.570 

so<00:03:17.750> now<00:03:17.900> at<00:03:18.080> Michaels<00:03:18.590> I<00:03:18.800> bought<00:03:19.010> gemstones

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:19.580 
so now at Michaels I bought gemstones

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:21.190 
so now at Michaels I bought gemstones
and<00:03:19.940> the<00:03:20.150> only<00:03:20.330> thing<00:03:20.480> you<00:03:20.570> guys<00:03:20.660> have<00:03:20.870> to<00:03:21.050> do

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:24.350 
is to cut them in small pieces and big

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:27.400 
is to cut them in small pieces and big
pieces<00:03:24.680> now<00:03:25.550> the<00:03:26.180> stuff<00:03:26.930> that<00:03:27.080> I<00:03:27.110> bought

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:27.410 
pieces now the stuff that I bought

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:29.980 
pieces now the stuff that I bought
already<00:03:27.890> has<00:03:28.130> kind<00:03:28.430> of<00:03:28.460> like<00:03:28.580> a<00:03:28.640> glue<00:03:29.030> but<00:03:29.840> it's

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:29.990 
already has kind of like a glue but it's

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:31.900 
already has kind of like a glue but it's
not<00:03:30.140> a<00:03:30.170> permanent<00:03:30.500> glue<00:03:30.890> but<00:03:31.280> that<00:03:31.580> is<00:03:31.730> going

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:31.910 
not a permanent glue but that is going

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:33.850 
not a permanent glue but that is going
to<00:03:32.000> help<00:03:32.180> us<00:03:32.360> actually<00:03:32.570> so<00:03:33.050> when<00:03:33.290> you<00:03:33.410> we<00:03:33.620> put

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:33.860 
to help us actually so when you we put

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:36.940 
to help us actually so when you we put
it<00:03:34.010> on<00:03:34.190> the<00:03:34.430> cup<00:03:34.840> it's<00:03:35.840> going<00:03:36.170> to<00:03:36.290> help<00:03:36.440> us<00:03:36.680> as<00:03:36.920> a

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:36.950 
it on the cup it's going to help us as a

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:39.730 
it on the cup it's going to help us as a
guide<00:03:37.280> so<00:03:37.880> right<00:03:38.120> now<00:03:38.330> I'm<00:03:38.870> just<00:03:38.930> doing<00:03:39.410> it

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:39.740 
guide so right now I'm just doing it

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:43.960 
guide so right now I'm just doing it
like<00:03:39.950> I'm<00:03:40.130> gluing<00:03:41.320> the<00:03:42.320> gems<00:03:42.620> to<00:03:43.040> the<00:03:43.610> fabric

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:43.970 
like I'm gluing the gems to the fabric

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:46.690 
like I'm gluing the gems to the fabric
now<00:03:44.209> when<00:03:44.780> you<00:03:44.959> are<00:03:45.140> putting<00:03:45.890> the<00:03:46.160> gems<00:03:46.400> to<00:03:46.520> the

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:46.700 
now when you are putting the gems to the

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:50.500 
now when you are putting the gems to the
fabric<00:03:47.150> you<00:03:47.480> can<00:03:47.660> use<00:03:48.070> glue<00:03:49.070> gun<00:03:49.310> but<00:03:50.120> when<00:03:50.390> you

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:50.510 
fabric you can use glue gun but when you

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:52.510 
fabric you can use glue gun but when you
actually<00:03:50.780> start<00:03:51.260> gluing<00:03:51.709> the<00:03:51.860> gems<00:03:52.190> to<00:03:52.310> the

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:52.520 
actually start gluing the gems to the

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:55.360 
actually start gluing the gems to the
actual<00:03:52.940> glass<00:03:53.180> you<00:03:53.810> will<00:03:53.990> need<00:03:54.290> to<00:03:54.500> use<00:03:54.770> super

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:55.370 
actual glass you will need to use super

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:57.220 
actual glass you will need to use super
glue<00:03:55.610> otherwise<00:03:56.209> it's<00:03:56.540> not<00:03:56.720> going<00:03:56.959> to<00:03:57.050> glue

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:57.230 
glue otherwise it's not going to glue

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:00.760 
glue otherwise it's not going to glue
and<00:03:57.440> it's<00:03:58.400> going<00:03:58.550> to<00:03:58.640> fall<00:03:58.760> apart

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:00.770 
and it's going to fall apart

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:04.230 
and it's going to fall apart
you

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:04.240 

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:12.460 

you

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:12.470 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:15.890 

so<00:04:13.470> now<00:04:13.590> I'm<00:04:13.770> just<00:04:13.950> taking<00:04:14.310> big<00:04:14.550> gems<00:04:14.880> and<00:04:15.150> I'm

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 
so now I'm just taking big gems and I'm

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:17.600 
so now I'm just taking big gems and I'm
just<00:04:16.170> puttin<00:04:16.350> placing<00:04:16.860> them<00:04:17.010> in<00:04:17.280> random

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:17.610 
just puttin placing them in random

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:20.210 
just puttin placing them in random
places<00:04:17.970> and<00:04:18.780> that<00:04:19.470> is<00:04:19.620> actually<00:04:19.980> going<00:04:20.070> to

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:20.220 
places and that is actually going to

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:22.280 
places and that is actually going to
look<00:04:20.340> way<00:04:20.489> pretty<00:04:20.850> than<00:04:21.150> just<00:04:21.540> a<00:04:21.660> uniform

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:22.290 
look way pretty than just a uniform

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:23.710 
look way pretty than just a uniform
plane

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:23.720 
plane

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:26.900 
plane
gems<00:04:24.720> so<00:04:25.710> that's<00:04:26.040> what<00:04:26.160> I'm<00:04:26.250> doing<00:04:26.520> and<00:04:26.640> like<00:04:26.700> I

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:26.910 
gems so that's what I'm doing and like I

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:28.940 
gems so that's what I'm doing and like I
was<00:04:27.030> telling<00:04:27.240> you<00:04:27.330> guys<00:04:27.480> use<00:04:27.750> glue<00:04:28.050> gun<00:04:28.290> when

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:28.950 
was telling you guys use glue gun when

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:32.530 
was telling you guys use glue gun when
you're<00:04:29.280> gluing<00:04:29.520> the<00:04:30.240> fabric<00:04:30.780> to<00:04:31.530> the<00:04:31.560> gems<00:04:32.100> and

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:32.540 
you're gluing the fabric to the gems and

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:35.960 
you're gluing the fabric to the gems and
once<00:04:33.540> you<00:04:33.720> do<00:04:33.900> the<00:04:34.110> gems<00:04:34.410> just<00:04:35.100> end<00:04:35.430> to<00:04:35.850> the

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:35.970 
once you do the gems just end to the

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:38.180 
once you do the gems just end to the
glass<00:04:36.210> to<00:04:36.450> the<00:04:36.480> actual<00:04:36.900> glass<00:04:37.050> just<00:04:37.860> use

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:38.190 
glass to the actual glass just use

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:41.770 
glass to the actual glass just use
superglue

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:41.780 

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:44.740 

and<00:04:41.980> actually<00:04:42.980> this<00:04:43.340> process<00:04:43.790> is<00:04:43.970> super<00:04:44.210> easy

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:44.750 
and actually this process is super easy

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:46.480 
and actually this process is super easy
I<00:04:44.780> just<00:04:44.870> wanted<00:04:45.290> to<00:04:45.470> share<00:04:45.650> it<00:04:45.710> with<00:04:45.980> you<00:04:46.220> and

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:46.490 
I just wanted to share it with you and

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:48.520 
I just wanted to share it with you and
let<00:04:46.639> you<00:04:46.760> know<00:04:46.910> how<00:04:46.940> I<00:04:47.120> did<00:04:47.480> it

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:48.530 
let you know how I did it

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:50.050 
let you know how I did it
the<00:04:48.770> only<00:04:48.889> thing<00:04:49.130> is<00:04:49.250> very<00:04:49.700> time-consuming

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:50.060 
the only thing is very time-consuming

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:52.440 
the only thing is very time-consuming
like<00:04:50.930> probably<00:04:51.200> I<00:04:51.440> took<00:04:51.770> around<00:04:51.919> 2<00:04:52.370> hours

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:52.450 
like probably I took around 2 hours

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:59.190 
like probably I took around 2 hours
doing<00:04:53.450> each<00:04:54.220> piece<00:04:57.310> so<00:04:58.310> now<00:04:58.340> I<00:04:58.460> measure<00:04:58.730> and

00:04:59.190 --> 00:04:59.200 
doing each piece so now I measure and

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:02.200 
doing each piece so now I measure and
then<00:05:00.200> cut<00:05:00.560> it<00:05:00.740> and<00:05:00.950> then<00:05:01.310> afterwards<00:05:01.880> just

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:02.210 
then cut it and then afterwards just

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:05.950 
then cut it and then afterwards just
glue<00:05:02.510> it

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:05.960 

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:09.890
