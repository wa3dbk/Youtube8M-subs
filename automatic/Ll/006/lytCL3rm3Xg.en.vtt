function<00:00:18.419> is<00:00:18.570> to<00:00:18.750> provide<00:00:19.109> support<00:00:19.710> for<00:00:19.769> the

00:00:19.999 --> 00:00:20.009 
function is to provide support for the

00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:23.140 
function is to provide support for the
foot<00:00:20.369> it<00:00:20.820> gathers<00:00:21.509> the<00:00:21.749> arch<00:00:21.960> up<00:00:22.289> and

foot it gathers the arch up and
surrounds<00:00:24.150> it<00:00:24.269> in<00:00:24.390> a<00:00:24.509> tight<00:00:24.900> casing<00:00:25.800> so<00:00:26.099> that

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
surrounds it in a tight casing so that

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.649 
surrounds it in a tight casing so that
nothing<00:00:26.640> Wiggles<00:00:27.060> around<00:00:27.150> in<00:00:27.480> your<00:00:27.599> foot

00:00:29.649 --> 00:00:29.659

lifting heavy weights is potentially

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.230 
lifting heavy weights is potentially
damaging<00:00:34.680> to<00:00:34.920> a<00:00:35.100> bare<00:00:35.430> foot<00:00:35.790> you're<00:00:36.090> not

compressible it's got a little heel on
it<00:00:48.510> which<00:00:48.810> gives<00:00:49.020> you<00:00:49.200> a<00:00:49.230> little<00:00:49.440> more<00:00:49.590> knee

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890
