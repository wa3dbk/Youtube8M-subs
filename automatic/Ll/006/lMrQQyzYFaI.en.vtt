00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:34.280
 minutes 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:37.880
 Meanwhile, we're going to warm up the 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:41.030
 oven to the maximum temperature and 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:43.730
 the next step is good passing 10 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:47.570

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:50.090

00:02:54.680 --> 00:03:07.189
 so we're going to open the dough now to 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:10.010
 The shelters are already in the 

00:03:07.189 --> 00:03:12.139
 going to take to the oven will go through 15 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:16.760

 flame of filling because I did not find 

00:03:28.189 --> 00:03:33.439
 difficult coverage coverage 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:35.450
 so let's put it gently because 

00:03:33.439 --> 00:03:37.519
 the dough is hot and probably 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:40.189
 brittle be careful not to overdo the 

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:44.680

00:03:40.189 --> 00:03:54.219
