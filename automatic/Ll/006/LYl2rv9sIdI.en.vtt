calorie<00:01:46.979> restricting<00:01:47.640> so<00:01:48.119> you<00:01:48.180> lose<00:01:48.450> weight

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
calorie restricting so you lose weight

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.450 
calorie restricting so you lose weight
in<00:01:48.780> those<00:01:48.899> two<00:01:49.229> ways<00:01:49.500> so<00:01:49.530> it's<00:01:49.920> worked<00:01:50.159> for<00:01:50.340> him

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
in those two ways so it's worked for him

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.249 
in those two ways so it's worked for him
he's<00:01:50.610> losing<00:01:50.970> weight<00:01:51.149> but<00:01:51.600> I<00:01:51.659> still<00:01:52.020> think

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
he's losing weight but I still think

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.319 
he's losing weight but I still think
this<00:01:52.380> sends<00:01:52.590> a<00:01:52.770> the<00:01:53.340> wrong<00:01:53.549> message<00:01:54.090> that

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
this sends a the wrong message that

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:57.109 
this sends a the wrong message that
carbs<00:01:54.840> are<00:01:55.020> bad<00:01:55.130> carbs<00:01:56.130> you<00:01:56.579> know<00:01:56.670> didn't<00:01:57.000> make

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
carbs are bad carbs you know didn't make

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.060 
carbs are bad carbs you know didn't make
him<00:01:57.270> fat<00:01:57.509> he<00:01:57.659> was<00:01:57.810> never<00:01:58.049> fat<00:01:58.380> to<00:01:58.530> begin<00:01:58.860> with

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
him fat he was never fat to begin with

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.420 
him fat he was never fat to begin with
he's<00:01:59.430> expose<00:02:00.290> extremely<00:02:01.290> muscular<00:02:01.799> through

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
he's expose extremely muscular through

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:08.710 
he's expose extremely muscular through
his<00:02:02.610> own<00:02:02.850> doing

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.270 

so<00:02:09.720> there's<00:02:09.899> no<00:02:10.050> question<00:02:10.530> you<00:02:10.679> can<00:02:10.979> power
