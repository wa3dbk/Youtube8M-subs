00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
completely ready by then and if they

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.620 
completely ready by then and if they
bring<00:01:32.579> him<00:01:32.700> back<00:01:32.880> too<00:01:33.180> early<00:01:33.240> at<00:01:33.570> the

bring him back too early at the

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.719 
bring him back too early at the
pay-per-view<00:01:33.900> they<00:01:34.799> could<00:01:35.009> risk<00:01:35.250> injuring

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
pay-per-view they could risk injuring

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.969 
pay-per-view they could risk injuring
him<00:01:35.880> again<00:01:36.210> and<00:01:36.420> it<00:01:36.750> could<00:01:36.930> be<00:01:37.049> out<00:01:37.290> for<00:01:37.590> even

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.460 
him again and it could be out for even
longer<00:01:38.189> now<00:01:39.060> from<00:01:39.299> this<00:01:39.509> we<00:01:39.810> can<00:01:39.840> sum<00:01:40.320> up<00:01:40.409> that

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
longer now from this we can sum up that

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.910 
longer now from this we can sum up that
may<00:01:40.829> be<00:01:40.890> there<00:01:41.640> that<00:01:42.420> the<00:01:42.990> earliest<00:01:43.380> they<00:01:43.619> feel

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
may be there that the earliest they feel

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.100

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
like he could return is Survivor Series

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.429
