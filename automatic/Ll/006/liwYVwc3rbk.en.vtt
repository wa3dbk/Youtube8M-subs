now
to<00:00:28.170> watch<00:00:28.410> this<00:00:28.590> video<00:00:28.800> it<00:00:29.789> gives<00:00:30.000> a<00:00:30.150> lot<00:00:30.300> of

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
to watch this video it gives a lot of

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.209 
to watch this video it gives a lot of
insight<00:00:30.599> and<00:00:30.960> growing<00:00:31.199> tomatillos<00:00:31.949> in

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
insight and growing tomatillos in

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.000 
insight and growing tomatillos in
general<00:00:32.610> so<00:00:33.540> these<00:00:33.750> are<00:00:34.020> our<00:00:34.170> tomatillo<00:00:34.680> seeds

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
general so these are our tomatillo seeds

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.770 
general so these are our tomatillo seeds
from<00:00:35.640> Rob's<00:00:36.059> rare<00:00:36.719> giant<00:00:37.260> seeds<00:00:37.739> calm<00:00:38.340> and

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:38.780 
from Rob's rare giant seeds calm and

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:41.720 
from Rob's rare giant seeds calm and
these<00:00:39.780> seeds<00:00:40.140> are<00:00:40.350> really<00:00:40.649> good<00:00:40.950> I<00:00:41.160> have<00:00:41.550> not

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
these seeds are really good I have not

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.959 
these seeds are really good I have not
bought<00:00:42.180> from<00:00:42.510> this<00:00:42.809> dealer<00:00:43.170> before<00:00:43.520> but<00:00:44.520> the

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
bought from this dealer before but the

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.389 
bought from this dealer before but the
seeds<00:00:45.239> were<00:00:45.390> of<00:00:45.539> really<00:00:45.870> good<00:00:45.989> quality<00:00:46.399> sort

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
seeds were of really good quality sort

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.400 
seeds were of really good quality sort
of<00:00:47.489> all<00:00:47.760> these<00:00:48.149> seeds<00:00:48.480> charting<00:00:48.989> techniques

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
of all these seeds charting techniques

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.590 
of all these seeds charting techniques
that<00:00:49.620> I've<00:00:49.739> used<00:00:50.039> I<00:00:50.430> think<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:51.360> most

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
that I've used I think the most

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.340 
that I've used I think the most
cost-effective<00:00:52.379> and<00:00:53.010> easy<00:00:53.690> solution<00:00:54.690> is<00:00:54.899> to

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
cost-effective and easy solution is to

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.250 
cost-effective and easy solution is to
use<00:00:55.559> the<00:00:55.949> seed<00:00:56.309> belet's<00:00:56.960> what<00:00:57.960> you<00:00:58.079> basically

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
use the seed belet's what you basically

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.430 
use the seed belet's what you basically
do<00:00:58.649> is<00:00:58.680> just<00:00:59.219> immerse<00:00:59.850> them<00:01:00.090> in<00:01:00.210> water<00:01:00.480> let

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
do is just immerse them in water let

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.030 
do is just immerse them in water let
them<00:01:01.710> expand<00:01:02.430> to<00:01:02.579> their<00:01:02.730> full<00:01:02.940> size<00:01:03.270> and<00:01:04.040> then

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
them expand to their full size and then

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.429 
them expand to their full size and then
start<00:01:05.369> planting<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:05.790> seeds<00:01:06.060> in<00:01:06.240> it<00:01:06.439> remember

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
start planting the seeds in it remember

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.710 
start planting the seeds in it remember
to<00:01:07.560> get<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:07.860> larger<00:01:08.369> size<00:01:08.400> seed<00:01:09.030> pellets<00:01:09.479> I'll

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
to get the larger size seed pellets I'll

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.960 
to get the larger size seed pellets I'll

provide a link in my video description
as<00:01:12.150> well<00:01:12.439> for<00:01:13.439> you<00:01:13.530> to<00:01:13.680> buy<00:01:13.860> these<00:01:14.130> seed

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
as well for you to buy these seed

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.899 
as well for you to buy these seed
pellets<00:01:14.850> and<00:01:15.600> just<00:01:16.290> make<00:01:16.470> a<00:01:16.500> little<00:01:16.770> hole<00:01:17.670> on

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
pellets and just make a little hole on

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.390 
pellets and just make a little hole on
the<00:01:18.000> top<00:01:18.270> you<00:01:18.960> don't<00:01:19.110> need<00:01:19.290> to<00:01:19.500> really<00:01:20.040> make<00:01:20.340> a

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
the top you don't need to really make a

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.740 
the top you don't need to really make a
big<00:01:20.640> hole<00:01:21.170> just<00:01:22.170> enough<00:01:22.409> for<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:22.619> seeds<00:01:23.220> to

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:23.750 
big hole just enough for the seeds to

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:28.550 
big hole just enough for the seeds to
settle<00:01:24.750> down<00:01:24.930> and<00:01:26.119> then<00:01:27.119> just<00:01:27.330> drop<00:01:27.659> in<00:01:27.900> two

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
settle down and then just drop in two

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.999 
settle down and then just drop in two
seeds<00:01:28.979> in<00:01:29.250> each<00:01:29.790> seed<00:01:30.420> pellet<00:01:30.810> now<00:01:31.770> some

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
seeds in each seed pellet now some

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.100 
seeds in each seed pellet now some
people<00:01:32.130> like<00:01:32.310> putting<00:01:32.970> one<00:01:33.000> see<00:01:33.570> here<00:01:33.720> as<00:01:33.869> well

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
people like putting one see here as well

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.289 
people like putting one see here as well
but<00:01:34.979> I<00:01:35.040> wasn't<00:01:35.369> sure<00:01:35.549> of<00:01:35.579> the<00:01:35.790> germination

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
but I wasn't sure of the germination

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.679 
but I wasn't sure of the germination
rates<00:01:36.750> for<00:01:37.170> these<00:01:37.500> seeds<00:01:37.799> so<00:01:38.520> I<00:01:38.549> just<00:01:38.880> went<00:01:39.450> on

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
rates for these seeds so I just went on

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.920 
rates for these seeds so I just went on
the<00:01:39.810> safe<00:01:40.020> side<00:01:40.290> and<00:01:40.320> put<00:01:40.770> two<00:01:41.070> seeds<00:01:41.400> i<00:01:41.930> neva

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
the safe side and put two seeds i neva

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.370 
the safe side and put two seeds i neva
had<00:01:42.960> a<00:01:43.079> lot<00:01:43.290> of<00:01:43.409> seeds<00:01:43.649> to<00:01:44.100> use<00:01:44.460> for<00:01:44.759> this

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.380 
had a lot of seeds to use for this

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:48.429 
had a lot of seeds to use for this
season

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:48.439 

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:50.899 

so<00:01:49.439> once<00:01:49.680> you've<00:01:49.860> planted<00:01:50.159> the<00:01:50.399> seeds<00:01:50.640> don't

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
so once you've planted the seeds don't

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.420 
so once you've planted the seeds don't
forget<00:01:51.299> to<00:01:51.420> label<00:01:51.780> the<00:01:51.840> seeds<00:01:52.079> I<00:01:52.409> think<00:01:53.310> that's

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
forget to label the seeds I think that's

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:59.680 
forget to label the seeds I think that's
a<00:01:53.520> common<00:01:53.729> mistake<00:01:54.149> that<00:01:54.180> a<00:01:54.390> lot<00:01:54.479> of<00:01:54.600> us<00:01:54.840> do

00:01:59.680 --> 00:01:59.690 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:02.360 

so<00:02:00.690> the<00:02:00.810> seed<00:02:01.080> should<00:02:01.380> germinate<00:02:01.710> in<00:02:02.100> about

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:02.370 
so the seed should germinate in about

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:05.180 
so the seed should germinate in about
seven<00:02:02.850> days<00:02:02.880> or<00:02:03.300> so<00:02:03.570> but<00:02:04.380> the<00:02:04.500> need<00:02:04.680> to<00:02:04.830> be<00:02:04.950> kept

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:05.190 
seven days or so but the need to be kept

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:08.330 
seven days or so but the need to be kept
in<00:02:05.430> a<00:02:05.550> greenhouse<00:02:06.480> or<00:02:06.960> indoors<00:02:07.530> in<00:02:07.950> a<00:02:08.100> sunny

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
in a greenhouse or indoors in a sunny

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.200 
in a greenhouse or indoors in a sunny
location<00:02:08.660> for<00:02:09.660> about<00:02:09.750> four<00:02:10.170> weeks<00:02:10.380> and<00:02:11.210> now

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:12.210 
location for about four weeks and now

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:16.100 
location for about four weeks and now
let's<00:02:12.510> plant<00:02:12.900> these<00:02:13.560> in<00:02:14.270> the<00:02:15.270> ground<00:02:15.600> as<00:02:15.990> well

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
let's plant these in the ground as well

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.980 
let's plant these in the ground as well
as<00:02:16.290> in<00:02:16.320> containers<00:02:16.890> I<00:02:17.240> usually<00:02:18.240> spread<00:02:18.630> out<00:02:18.780> my

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
as in containers I usually spread out my

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:21.530 
as in containers I usually spread out my
plants<00:02:19.470> in<00:02:19.590> both<00:02:19.830> containers<00:02:20.310> and<00:02:20.700> the<00:02:21.240> ground

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
plants in both containers and the ground

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.830 
plants in both containers and the ground
and<00:02:22.310> it's<00:02:23.310> how<00:02:23.520> it<00:02:23.700> needs<00:02:24.030> to<00:02:24.120> go<00:02:24.360> it<00:02:24.480> just<00:02:24.690> need

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
and it's how it needs to go it just need

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.400 
and it's how it needs to go it just need
to<00:02:24.870> be<00:02:24.960> that<00:02:25.200> much<00:02:25.410> deep<00:02:25.650> and<00:02:26.930> since<00:02:27.930> the<00:02:28.170> roots

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
to be that much deep and since the roots

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.640 
to be that much deep and since the roots
have<00:02:28.650> already<00:02:28.980> started<00:02:29.190> growing<00:02:29.580> out<00:02:29.880> of<00:02:29.910> this

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
have already started growing out of this

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.740 
have already started growing out of this
pellet<00:02:31.650> I'm<00:02:31.890> just<00:02:32.610> gonna<00:02:32.760> plant<00:02:33.090> it<00:02:33.240> right<00:02:33.510> in

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
pellet I'm just gonna plant it right in

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.220 
pellet I'm just gonna plant it right in
the<00:02:33.870> ground<00:02:34.050> just<00:02:34.440> look<00:02:34.620> at<00:02:35.060> the<00:02:36.060> pellet<00:02:36.450> cover

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
the ground just look at the pellet cover

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.949 
the ground just look at the pellet cover
will<00:02:37.560> decompose<00:02:38.100> over<00:02:38.430> time<00:02:38.700> so<00:02:39.690> you<00:02:39.720> don't

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 
will decompose over time so you don't

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:42.920 
will decompose over time so you don't
have<00:02:40.080> to<00:02:40.200> worry<00:02:40.440> about<00:02:40.590> it<00:02:41.000> so<00:02:42.000> I<00:02:42.030> have<00:02:42.240> staked

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
have to worry about it so I have staked

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.980 
have to worry about it so I have staked
this<00:02:43.590> tomato<00:02:43.890> plant<00:02:44.220> with<00:02:44.820> the<00:02:45.240> same<00:02:45.540> stakes

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:45.990 
this tomato plant with the same stakes

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:47.960 
this tomato plant with the same stakes
that<00:02:46.140> I've<00:02:46.320> been<00:02:46.440> using<00:02:46.620> for<00:02:46.830> my<00:02:47.070> tomatoes<00:02:47.610> and

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
that I've been using for my tomatoes and

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:51.020 
that I've been using for my tomatoes and
eggplants<00:02:48.570> and<00:02:48.950> it's<00:02:49.950> done<00:02:50.130> a<00:02:50.160> great<00:02:50.490> job<00:02:50.520> so

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
eggplants and it's done a great job so

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.949 
eggplants and it's done a great job so
far<00:02:51.080> supporting<00:02:52.080> all<00:02:52.320> of<00:02:52.500> these<00:02:52.650> plants

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:53.959 
far supporting all of these plants

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:57.920 
far supporting all of these plants
so<00:02:54.959> as<00:02:55.140> the<00:02:55.320> tomatillo<00:02:55.830> plant<00:02:56.220> grows<00:02:56.750> you<00:02:57.750> go

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
so as the tomatillo plant grows you go

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.920 
so as the tomatillo plant grows you go
to<00:02:57.990> have<00:02:58.290> a<00:02:58.709> lot<00:02:59.610> of<00:02:59.760> nutrition<00:03:00.150> provided<00:03:00.780> for

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
to have a lot of nutrition provided for

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:04.430 
to have a lot of nutrition provided for
the<00:03:01.019> plant<00:03:01.910> especially<00:03:02.910> nitrogen<00:03:03.660> and<00:03:03.959> the

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
the plant especially nitrogen and the

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.920 
the plant especially nitrogen and the
earlier<00:03:04.860> phases<00:03:05.150> so<00:03:06.150> you<00:03:06.209> can<00:03:06.360> use<00:03:06.570> a<00:03:06.600> lot<00:03:06.900> of

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
earlier phases so you can use a lot of

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:10.610 
earlier phases so you can use a lot of
manure<00:03:07.800> compost<00:03:09.110> or<00:03:10.110> if<00:03:10.320> you're<00:03:10.440> using

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
manure compost or if you're using

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.860 
manure compost or if you're using
balanced<00:03:11.190> fertilizers<00:03:11.970> all<00:03:12.269> of<00:03:12.480> them<00:03:12.630> work

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
balanced fertilizers all of them work

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.320 
balanced fertilizers all of them work
pretty<00:03:13.080> well<00:03:13.340> this<00:03:14.340> is<00:03:14.519> the<00:03:14.610> other<00:03:14.760> tomatillo

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:15.330 
pretty well this is the other tomatillo

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:17.840 
pretty well this is the other tomatillo
plant<00:03:15.720> growing<00:03:15.989> in<00:03:16.170> a<00:03:16.260> container<00:03:16.640> now<00:03:17.640> in<00:03:17.760> the

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:17.850 
plant growing in a container now in the

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:19.940 
plant growing in a container now in the
previous<00:03:18.060> season<00:03:18.720> when<00:03:18.900> I<00:03:18.930> harvested<00:03:19.620> to<00:03:19.769> me

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
previous season when I harvested to me

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:24.500 
previous season when I harvested to me
to<00:03:20.160> use<00:03:20.370> I<00:03:20.930> learned<00:03:21.930> that<00:03:22.970> tomatillo<00:03:23.970> plants

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
to use I learned that tomatillo plants

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:27.860 
to use I learned that tomatillo plants
cannot<00:03:24.959> pollinate<00:03:25.650> their<00:03:25.950> own<00:03:26.250> flowers<00:03:26.880> which

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
cannot pollinate their own flowers which

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:32.060 
cannot pollinate their own flowers which
means<00:03:28.230> that<00:03:29.209> it<00:03:30.209> will<00:03:30.540> pollinate<00:03:31.110> but<00:03:31.799> with

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:32.070 
means that it will pollinate but with

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:34.600 
means that it will pollinate but with
flowers<00:03:32.580> from<00:03:32.850> other<00:03:33.150> tomatillo<00:03:33.810> plants

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:34.610 
flowers from other tomatillo plants

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:37.340 
flowers from other tomatillo plants
which<00:03:35.610> means<00:03:35.880> that<00:03:36.239> you<00:03:36.660> need<00:03:36.810> to<00:03:36.930> plant<00:03:37.170> at

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:37.350 
which means that you need to plant at

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:40.810 
which means that you need to plant at
least<00:03:37.590> 2<00:03:38.070> or<00:03:38.280> 3<00:03:38.310> tomatillo<00:03:39.120> plants<00:03:39.780> to<00:03:40.140> get<00:03:40.410> a

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:40.820 
least 2 or 3 tomatillo plants to get a

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:44.090 
least 2 or 3 tomatillo plants to get a
decent<00:03:41.820> fruit<00:03:42.120> production<00:03:42.860> now<00:03:43.860> in<00:03:43.980> my

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:44.100 
decent fruit production now in my

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:46.550 
decent fruit production now in my
previous<00:03:44.430> season<00:03:44.910> I<00:03:45.060> did<00:03:45.390> grow<00:03:45.600> tomatoes<00:03:45.780> just

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
previous season I did grow tomatoes just

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.500 
previous season I did grow tomatoes just
one<00:03:46.799> and<00:03:47.070> it<00:03:47.640> did<00:03:47.820> produce<00:03:47.970> a<00:03:48.239> lot<00:03:48.360> of<00:03:48.390> tomatoes

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
one and it did produce a lot of tomatoes

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:53.449 
one and it did produce a lot of tomatoes
I<00:03:49.230> don't<00:03:49.830> know<00:03:49.950> how<00:03:50.180> but<00:03:51.180> in<00:03:51.330> this<00:03:52.190> season<00:03:53.190> and

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:53.459 
I don't know how but in this season and

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:56.060 
I don't know how but in this season and
for<00:03:53.610> this<00:03:53.760> tomatillo<00:03:54.239> plant<00:03:54.660> I<00:03:55.019> made<00:03:55.830> sure

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:56.070 
for this tomatillo plant I made sure

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:58.789 
for this tomatillo plant I made sure
that<00:03:56.100> I<00:03:56.250> planted<00:03:56.610> at<00:03:56.910> least<00:03:57.180> 3<00:03:57.660> plants<00:03:58.170> so

00:03:58.789 --> 00:03:58.799 
that I planted at least 3 plants so

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:00.320 
that I planted at least 3 plants so
there<00:03:59.100> are<00:03:59.190> sufficient<00:03:59.400> flowers<00:04:00.150> available

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:00.330 
there are sufficient flowers available

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:02.970 
there are sufficient flowers available
for<00:04:01.080> pollination

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:02.980 
for pollination

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:05.520 
for pollination
so<00:04:03.880> as<00:04:03.970> you<00:04:04.120> can<00:04:04.240> see<00:04:04.450> we<00:04:04.630> are<00:04:04.660> now<00:04:04.840> harvesting

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:05.530 
so as you can see we are now harvesting

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:08.130 
so as you can see we are now harvesting
or<00:04:05.740> giant<00:04:06.190> tomatillos<00:04:06.790> and<00:04:07.090> they<00:04:08.020> are

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:08.140 
or giant tomatillos and they are

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:11.000 
or giant tomatillos and they are
significantly<00:04:09.040> larger<00:04:09.760> than<00:04:09.790> the<00:04:10.120> tomatillos

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.010 
significantly larger than the tomatillos

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:15.330 
significantly larger than the tomatillos
that<00:04:12.010> are<00:04:12.220> of<00:04:12.430> regular<00:04:12.850> size<00:04:13.180> and<00:04:13.570> I<00:04:14.560> think<00:04:15.070> a

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:15.340 
that are of regular size and I think a

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:19.680 
that are of regular size and I think a
growing<00:04:15.760> giant<00:04:16.060> tomatillos<00:04:16.870> are<00:04:17.320> a<00:04:17.859> a<00:04:18.690> better

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:19.690 
growing giant tomatillos are a a better

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:22.080 
growing giant tomatillos are a a better
value<00:04:20.170> for<00:04:20.950> the<00:04:21.100> space<00:04:21.430> that<00:04:21.670> you're<00:04:21.820> growing

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:22.090 
value for the space that you're growing

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:24.200 
value for the space that you're growing
in<00:04:22.360> compared<00:04:22.780> to<00:04:22.870> the<00:04:23.020> small<00:04:23.320> tomatillos

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:24.210 
in compared to the small tomatillos

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:26.220 
in compared to the small tomatillos
because<00:04:25.210> although<00:04:25.450> the<00:04:25.720> plant<00:04:25.990> doesn't

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:26.230 
because although the plant doesn't

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:29.730 
because although the plant doesn't
produce<00:04:26.680> a<00:04:26.890> lot<00:04:27.280> of<00:04:27.310> tomatoes<00:04:28.230> the<00:04:29.230> tomatoes

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:29.740 
produce a lot of tomatoes the tomatoes

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:33.080 
produce a lot of tomatoes the tomatoes
that<00:04:29.770> it<00:04:30.040> produces<00:04:30.400> are<00:04:30.610> pretty<00:04:31.180> big<00:04:31.450> in<00:04:31.660> size

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:33.090 
that it produces are pretty big in size

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:35.940 
that it produces are pretty big in size
so<00:04:34.090> let's<00:04:34.270> look<00:04:34.390> at<00:04:34.540> this<00:04:34.720> tomatillo<00:04:35.260> this<00:04:35.740> is

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:35.950 
so let's look at this tomatillo this is

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:39.270 
so let's look at this tomatillo this is
one<00:04:36.220> of<00:04:36.370> the<00:04:36.520> largest<00:04:36.850> ones<00:04:37.300> I<00:04:37.510> got<00:04:37.810> and<00:04:38.280> this

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:39.280 
one of the largest ones I got and this

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:43.020 
one of the largest ones I got and this
is<00:04:39.580> actually<00:04:40.150> as<00:04:40.450> big<00:04:40.840> as<00:04:41.110> a<00:04:41.140> tomato<00:04:41.770> or<00:04:42.040> maybe

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:43.030 
is actually as big as a tomato or maybe

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:47.190 
is actually as big as a tomato or maybe
even<00:04:43.360> a<00:04:43.450> small<00:04:43.600> green<00:04:44.140> pepper<00:04:44.410> and<00:04:46.200> these

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:47.200 
even a small green pepper and these

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:49.380 
even a small green pepper and these
giant<00:04:47.650> tomatillos<00:04:48.130> are<00:04:48.430> just<00:04:48.730> as<00:04:48.910> flavorful

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:49.390 
giant tomatillos are just as flavorful

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:52.620 
giant tomatillos are just as flavorful
as<00:04:49.630> the<00:04:50.290> smaller<00:04:50.650> tomatillos<00:04:51.370> and<00:04:51.669> a<00:04:52.390> lot

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:52.630 
as the smaller tomatillos and a lot

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:55.200 
as the smaller tomatillos and a lot
easier<00:04:53.080> to<00:04:53.260> handle<00:04:53.730> so<00:04:54.730> that's<00:04:54.940> how<00:04:55.060> our

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:55.210 
easier to handle so that's how our

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:58.140 
easier to handle so that's how our
harvest<00:04:55.240> looks<00:04:55.600> like<00:04:56.020> it's<00:04:56.770> very<00:04:57.730> late<00:04:57.970> in<00:04:58.120> the

00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:58.150 
harvest looks like it's very late in the

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:00.180 
harvest looks like it's very late in the
season<00:04:58.419> here<00:04:58.930> I<00:04:58.960> actually<00:04:59.500> started<00:05:00.010> these

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:00.190 
season here I actually started these

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:02.460 
season here I actually started these
plants<00:05:00.520> very<00:05:00.669> late<00:05:00.970> I<00:05:01.270> hope<00:05:01.870> to<00:05:02.080> start<00:05:02.290> them

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:02.470 
plants very late I hope to start them

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:05.490 
plants very late I hope to start them
sooner<00:05:02.890> next<00:05:03.310> season<00:05:03.960> but<00:05:04.960> it's<00:05:05.200> a<00:05:05.320> pretty

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:05.500 
sooner next season but it's a pretty

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:07.260 
sooner next season but it's a pretty
decent<00:05:05.950> harvest<00:05:06.160> and<00:05:06.640> it's<00:05:06.790> definitely

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:07.270 
decent harvest and it's definitely

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:10.230 
decent harvest and it's definitely
usable<00:05:07.780> at<00:05:08.140> least<00:05:08.380> a<00:05:08.500> few<00:05:08.650> times<00:05:08.729> if<00:05:09.729> you<00:05:10.120> get

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:10.240 
usable at least a few times if you get
