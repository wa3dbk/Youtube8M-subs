00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:02.830 
forgot to mention you guys I'm on the
top<00:03:56.480> of<00:03:56.750> the<00:03:57.080> display<00:03:57.730> here<00:03:59.770> there's<00:04:00.770> a<00:04:01.840> little

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:02.840 
top of the display here there's a little

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:06.730 
top of the display here there's a little
like<00:04:03.530> an<00:04:03.710> LED<00:04:03.950> or<00:04:04.460> some<00:04:05.150> sort<00:04:05.330> of<00:04:05.420> sensor<00:04:05.840> but

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:06.740 
like an LED or some sort of sensor but

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:11.350 
like an LED or some sort of sensor but
that<00:04:06.920> actually<00:04:07.520> is<00:04:07.640> I<00:04:07.670> think<00:04:07.850> is<00:04:08.360> a<00:04:08.810> sensor<00:04:10.360> for

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:11.360 
that actually is I think is a sensor for

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:14.470 
that actually is I think is a sensor for
light<00:04:11.720> this<00:04:12.500> particular<00:04:12.980> display<00:04:13.430> I<00:04:13.730> just

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:14.480 
light this particular display I just

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:17.650 
light this particular display I just
showed<00:04:14.900> adjust<00:04:15.260> its<00:04:15.560> own<00:04:15.710> brightness<00:04:16.220> and<00:04:16.660> so

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:17.660 
showed adjust its own brightness and so

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:21.190 
showed adjust its own brightness and so
they<00:04:17.810> say<00:04:17.989> save<00:04:18.520> some<00:04:19.520> electricity<00:04:20.239> that<00:04:20.780> way

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:21.200 
they say save some electricity that way

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:25.290 
they say save some electricity that way
next<00:04:21.890> we're<00:04:22.160> gonna<00:04:22.280> plug<00:04:23.120> that<00:04:23.180> in<00:04:23.450> and<00:04:24.290> see

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:25.300 
next we're gonna plug that in and see

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:28.960 
next we're gonna plug that in and see
how<00:04:26.300> it<00:04:26.360> looks<00:04:26.420> like<00:04:26.710> and<00:04:27.710> I'm<00:04:28.100> back<00:04:28.280> this<00:04:28.700> is<00:04:28.940> a

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:28.970 
how it looks like and I'm back this is a

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:31.600 
how it looks like and I'm back this is a
quick<00:04:29.390> demonstration<00:04:29.570> of<00:04:30.260> twenty<00:04:31.130> seven<00:04:31.460> and

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:31.610 
quick demonstration of twenty seven and

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:34.870 
quick demonstration of twenty seven and
fifteen<00:04:32.210> inch<00:04:32.630> monitor<00:04:33.200> side<00:04:33.410> by<00:04:33.620> side<00:04:33.920> never

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:34.880 
fifteen inch monitor side by side never

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:37.660 
fifteen inch monitor side by side never
mind<00:04:35.090> the<00:04:35.270> bluish<00:04:35.780> tint<00:04:36.380> in<00:04:36.680> the<00:04:36.770> chorus<00:04:37.160> of<00:04:37.370> a

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:37.670 
mind the bluish tint in the chorus of a

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:40.120 
mind the bluish tint in the chorus of a
source<00:04:38.030> monitor<00:04:38.570> there<00:04:38.780> and<00:04:39.050> I<00:04:39.410> actually<00:04:39.650> can

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:40.130 
source monitor there and I actually can

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:42.010 
source monitor there and I actually can
see<00:04:40.460> it<00:04:40.520> with<00:04:40.760> the<00:04:40.820> naked<00:04:40.940> eye<00:04:41.240> there<00:04:41.630> must<00:04:41.870> be

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:42.020 
see it with the naked eye there must be

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:45.160 
see it with the naked eye there must be
some<00:04:42.230> sort<00:04:42.410> of<00:04:42.880> gimmick<00:04:43.880> when<00:04:44.420> you<00:04:44.630> filming<00:04:45.050> it

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:45.170 
some sort of gimmick when you filming it

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:48.970 
some sort of gimmick when you filming it
with<00:04:45.380> the<00:04:45.530> camera<00:04:46.070> that's<00:04:46.700> 1280<00:04:47.570> 1024<00:04:48.320> and

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:48.980 
with the camera that's 1280 1024 and

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:54.040 
with the camera that's 1280 1024 and
this<00:04:49.940> one<00:04:50.120> is<00:04:50.360> running<00:04:50.900> at<00:04:51.260> 1080p<00:04:52.840> see<00:04:53.840> the

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:54.050 
this one is running at 1080p see the

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:56.290 
this one is running at 1080p see the
blue<00:04:54.980> tent<00:04:55.310> I<00:04:55.460> don't<00:04:55.640> know<00:04:55.700> why<00:04:55.940> is<00:04:56.090> it

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:56.300 
blue tent I don't know why is it

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:57.600 
blue tent I don't know why is it
appearing<00:04:56.780> over<00:04:56.960> there

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:57.610 
appearing over there

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:01.810 
appearing over there
anyway<00:04:58.780> so<00:04:59.780> that's<00:04:59.900> basically<00:05:00.440> it<00:05:00.770> and<00:05:01.130> I

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:01.820 
anyway so that's basically it and I

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:04.450 
anyway so that's basically it and I
actually<00:05:02.000> connected<00:05:02.540> it<00:05:02.690> with<00:05:02.930> the<00:05:02.980> via<00:05:03.980> DVI

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:04.460 
actually connected it with the via DVI

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:07.150 
actually connected it with the via DVI
cable<00:05:04.900> reason<00:05:05.900> being<00:05:06.050> is<00:05:06.230> I<00:05:06.350> just<00:05:06.410> like<00:05:06.980> it

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:07.160 
cable reason being is I just like it

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:08.980 
cable reason being is I just like it
because<00:05:07.430> it's<00:05:07.610> more<00:05:07.820> secure<00:05:08.390> and<00:05:08.600> it's<00:05:08.870> a

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:08.990 
because it's more secure and it's a

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:13.180 
because it's more secure and it's a
digital<00:05:09.170> anyway<00:05:10.240> and<00:05:11.260> that's<00:05:12.260> pretty<00:05:12.680> much<00:05:12.860> it

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:13.190 
digital anyway and that's pretty much it

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:15.700 
digital anyway and that's pretty much it
in<00:05:13.490> case<00:05:13.700> you<00:05:13.880> wondered<00:05:14.210> this<00:05:14.360> is<00:05:14.570> NZXT<00:05:15.200> camera

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:15.710 
in case you wondered this is NZXT camera
