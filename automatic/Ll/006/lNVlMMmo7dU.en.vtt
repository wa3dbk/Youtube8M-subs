00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:09.900
 hello dear viewers today 

00:00:06.279 --> 00:00:13.720
 I want to show you how to do it 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:16.439
 lightbox for subject photography 

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:19.949
 goods for example for online stores 

00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:24.119
 some box is sold which you 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.119
 fit your goods 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:36.010
 a4 also a piece of drawing paper that is a big 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:39.760
 Scotch tape can be double-sided 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:43.240
 the usual also office knife scissors 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:47.610
 how can you cut it all and do not 

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:53.080
 so do pencil and ruler 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:54.610
 draw rectangular right here 

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:58.079
 windows such 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:01:03.520
 which we will cut from this box 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:06.060
 how will draw a person will be placed 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:10.450
 candy will face 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:21.249
 of the tanks we also do what markup 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:27.329
 from both sides to have already marked 

00:01:21.249 --> 00:01:31.859
 like the sides cut on it take the knife off 

00:01:27.329 --> 00:01:31.859
 I'm growing up 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:41.060
 back to work, here we cut through the element 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:43.310
 i will give the bottom the bottom line end 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:46.190
 together with this cover what then her 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:48.200
 sealer on time here's an extra 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:51.260
 stiffness like this she will on this 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:55.220
 the screen will stand a single layer will 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:59.620
 disastrous that we got this 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:03.200
 journey design 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:06.530
 improve here we turned our 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:12.470
 transportation and i think of the same waste 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:14.530
 do but he was stronger help 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:20.090
 Scotch I feel everything is tied down 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:24.410
 aim before installing on with sizing 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:27.080
 all these songs are cops tsiri we take out 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:30.320
 fold for stiffness on behind them 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:35.810
 functions you hurt the skin give just one 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:39.709
 prisobachili probably better just not 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:41.510
 cut another such part of it will be 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:45.800
 much better just sit down then 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:47.170
 extra extra since 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:55.270
 what he 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:57.520
 so she's supreme strong enough you can 

00:02:55.270 --> 00:03:00.599
 Slowly move on to the next one here. 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:04.630
 we will be a muzzle that is like this 

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:06.400
 there will be Whatman gas you need to watch 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:09.310
 their all zones that we have 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:11.440
 you can glue brown something white 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:14.800
 or paper or whatever i think is just 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:19.840
 take the restaurant scotch pasted over everything 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:29.110
 but I will not shoot the second part here 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:31.959
 try everything you need sister he will 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:36.510
 great we can stand here 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:36.510
 top and side holes 

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:49.250
 and 4 that is, we need to do for 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:51.380
 matting and to 4 cost we all pasted over 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:53.840
 what should have been possible now 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:59.510
 insert mid watts on for our 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:04:02.060
 will give the final white rhizo you buy 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:06.430
 paperman width 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:12.260
 the necessary piece and I cut off here tests 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:14.180
 here we set our mid guess 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:21.709
 I will not mount much just on top 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:28.190
 secured a piece of scotch we try 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:32.000
 lamp switch for $ 3 another 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:37.580
 such a bright light bulb on top 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:38.980
 light bulbs are more expensive than themselves than 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:43.510
 the lamps themselves 

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:45.920
 Well, to try to take pictures 

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:48.740
 You can try to see that in principle 

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:51.700
 light unity what should not nowhere 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:51.700
 be trying
