00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:45.489 
really awesome so it's basically you

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:47.039 
really awesome so it's basically you
know<00:02:45.579> just<00:02:45.790> a<00:02:45.879> bunch<00:02:46.030> of<00:02:46.120> lava<00:02:46.359> what<00:02:46.689> happens

after<00:02:47.169> 10<00:02:47.500> minutes<00:02:47.680> we<00:02:47.889> got<00:02:48.010> some<00:02:48.159> water<00:02:48.340> that

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:48.579 
after 10 minutes we got some water that

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:50.220 
after 10 minutes we got some water that
flows<00:02:48.790> down<00:02:49.060> and<00:02:49.329> creates<00:02:49.599> i<00:02:49.720> guess<00:02:49.989> like

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
flows down and creates i guess like

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:54.420 
flows down and creates i guess like
obsidian<00:02:50.950> and<00:02:51.250> bedrock<00:02:51.609> and<00:02:51.879> it<00:02:53.310> you<00:02:54.310> know

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
obsidian and bedrock and it you know

00:02:54.430 --> 00:03:00.449 
obsidian and bedrock and it you know
turns<00:02:55.060> into<00:02:55.359> a<00:02:57.480> bridge<00:02:58.480> basically<00:02:59.200> and<00:02:59.459> it's

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:00.459 
turns into a bridge basically and it's

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:02.220 
turns into a bridge basically and it's
best<00:03:00.819> off<00:03:01.060> to<00:03:01.299> play<00:03:01.450> this<00:03:01.629> minigame<00:03:01.900> since

00:04:43.969 --> 00:04:43.979 
game i enjoyed it on pc and i never

00:04:43.979 --> 00:04:46.939 
game i enjoyed it on pc and i never
thought<00:04:44.370> of<00:04:44.580> this<00:04:44.610> way<00:04:44.940> of<00:04:45.259> you<00:04:46.259> know<00:04:46.289> me<00:04:46.530> like

00:04:46.939 --> 00:04:46.949 
thought of this way of you know me like

00:04:46.949 --> 00:04:49.309 
thought of this way of you know me like
I<00:04:47.099> thought<00:04:47.310> of<00:04:47.430> other<00:04:47.610> ways<00:04:47.849> of<00:04:48.319> recreating

00:04:49.309 --> 00:04:49.319 
I thought of other ways of recreating

00:04:49.319 --> 00:04:51.950 
I thought of other ways of recreating
this<00:04:49.620> game<00:04:49.830> on<00:04:50.069> PlayStation<00:04:50.780> but<00:04:51.780> I<00:04:51.810> never

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:51.960 
this game on PlayStation but I never

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:53.570 
this game on PlayStation but I never
thought<00:04:52.199> of<00:04:52.319> it<00:04:52.409> like<00:04:52.470> this<00:04:52.770> because<00:04:53.009> most<00:04:53.430> of

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:53.580 
thought of it like this because most of

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:56.779 
thought of it like this because most of
the<00:04:53.930> the<00:04:54.930> bridges<00:04:55.620> are<00:04:55.770> actually<00:04:56.159> in<00:04:56.280> the<00:04:56.460> sky

00:04:56.779 --> 00:04:56.789 
the the bridges are actually in the sky

00:04:56.789 --> 00:05:00.170 
the the bridges are actually in the sky
and<00:04:57.090> the<00:04:57.349> bridges<00:04:58.349> drop<00:04:58.830> somehow<00:04:59.729> like<00:04:59.970> I<00:05:00.030> was

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:00.180 
and the bridges drop somehow like I was

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:02.659 
and the bridges drop somehow like I was
thinking<00:05:00.330> some<00:05:00.960> other<00:05:01.110> ways<00:05:01.380> to<00:05:02.159> do<00:05:02.310> it<00:05:02.460> like

00:05:02.659 --> 00:05:02.669 
thinking some other ways to do it like

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:05.390 
thinking some other ways to do it like
gravel<00:05:03.240> and<00:05:03.389> stuff<00:05:03.860> but<00:05:04.860> this<00:05:05.009> way<00:05:05.220> is

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:05.400 
gravel and stuff but this way is

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:07.879 
gravel and stuff but this way is
definitely<00:05:05.819> really<00:05:06.030> cool<00:05:06.259> and<00:05:07.259> as<00:05:07.530> and<00:05:07.740> he
