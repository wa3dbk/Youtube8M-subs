00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.120 
that's about half a ten-foot roll just
give<00:02:28.690> it<00:02:28.930> the<00:02:28.960> water<00:02:29.230> and<00:02:29.530> ended<00:02:29.740> up<00:02:29.800> kind<00:02:30.070> of

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130 
give it the water and ended up kind of

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:31.950 
give it the water and ended up kind of
walking<00:02:30.340> huh<00:02:30.730> right<00:02:31.330> so<00:02:31.480> give<00:02:31.660> it<00:02:31.690> a<00:02:31.780> bit<00:02:31.870> the

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:31.960 
walking huh right so give it a bit the

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:38.600 
walking huh right so give it a bit the
water<00:02:32.140> in<00:02:32.410> it

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.770 

so<00:02:39.610> what<00:02:39.790> collect<00:02:40.150> put<00:02:40.390> the<00:02:40.480> hit<00:02:40.600> at<00:02:40.720> the

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
so what collect put the hit at the

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.110 
so what collect put the hit at the
polytunnel<00:02:41.230> should<00:02:41.560> be<00:02:41.790> like<00:02:42.790> I<00:02:42.820> said

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
polytunnel should be like I said

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.690 
polytunnel should be like I said
definitely<00:02:43.300> within<00:02:43.780> a<00:02:43.810> week<00:02:44.430> and<00:02:45.430> then<00:02:45.610> as

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
definitely within a week and then as

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.610 
definitely within a week and then as
soon<00:02:45.850> as<00:02:45.970> a<00:02:46.030> half<00:02:46.750> an<00:02:46.900> inch<00:02:46.990> tall<00:02:47.320> an<00:02:47.470> inch

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
soon as a half an inch tall an inch

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:51.660 
soon as a half an inch tall an inch
Tarble<00:02:48.450> with<00:02:49.450> chuck<00:02:49.690> them<00:02:49.810> in<00:02:50.370> it<00:02:51.370> was<00:02:51.490> a<00:02:51.520> bit

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 
Tarble with chuck them in it was a bit

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:52.980 
Tarble with chuck them in it was a bit
of<00:02:51.730> a<00:02:51.760> head<00:02:51.940> start<00:02:52.060> should<00:02:52.570> get<00:02:52.720> hundred

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:52.990 
of a head start should get hundred

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:55.890 
of a head start should get hundred
percent<00:02:53.230> germination<00:02:54.330> and<00:02:55.330> that's<00:02:55.480> a<00:02:55.540> trip<00:02:55.750> up

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
percent germination and that's a trip up

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:00.510 
percent germination and that's a trip up
and<00:02:55.990> drop<00:02:56.200> them<00:02:56.290> off<00:02:57.840> so<00:02:58.840> that's<00:02:58.990> about<00:02:59.110> it<00:02:59.520> and

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:00.520 
and drop them off so that's about it and

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:02.840 
and drop them off so that's about it and
let<00:03:00.610> you<00:03:00.700> know<00:03:00.850> that<00:03:00.880> they'll<00:03:01.209> do<00:03:01.300> a<00:03:01.330> bit<00:03:01.570> of<00:03:01.600> a

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:02.850 
let you know that they'll do a bit of a

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:04.949 
let you know that they'll do a bit of a
carrying<00:03:03.850> on<00:03:03.940> bit<00:03:04.120> of<00:03:04.240> video<00:03:04.450> when<00:03:04.720> the<00:03:04.780> world

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:04.959 
carrying on bit of video when the world

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:06.630 
carrying on bit of video when the world
sprout<00:03:05.350> and<00:03:05.590> we'll<00:03:05.740> show<00:03:06.250> you<00:03:06.280> how<00:03:06.370> we<00:03:06.430> put

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:06.640 
sprout and we'll show you how we put

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.059 
sprout and we'll show you how we put
them<00:03:06.790> in<00:03:06.880> them<00:03:07.000> all<00:03:07.180> apart

00:03:08.059 --> 00:03:08.069 
them in them all apart

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:10.880 
them in them all apart
so<00:03:08.640> that's<00:03:08.819> about<00:03:08.909> it<00:03:09.060> lot<00:03:09.390> clocks<00:03:09.750> what<00:03:10.140> Fox

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
so that's about it lot clocks what Fox

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:14.599 
so that's about it lot clocks what Fox
easy-peasy<00:03:11.849> city<00:03:12.390> letter
