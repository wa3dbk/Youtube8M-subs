00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.760 
that the boss is actually really light

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.289 
that the boss is actually really light
it's<00:03:08.150> the<00:03:08.540> same<00:03:08.750> kind<00:03:08.989> of<00:03:09.049> lightness<00:03:09.530> that<00:03:10.299> is

00:03:11.289 --> 00:03:11.299 
it's the same kind of lightness that is

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:13.690 
it's the same kind of lightness that is
associated<00:03:11.840> with<00:03:11.989> kind<00:03:12.680> of<00:03:12.829> like<00:03:13.010> a<00:03:13.040> economy

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700 
associated with kind of like a economy

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:15.309 
associated with kind of like a economy
car<00:03:14.120> but<00:03:14.329> I<00:03:14.510> mean<00:03:14.720> it's<00:03:14.840> not<00:03:14.959> that<00:03:15.019> it's<00:03:15.140> a<00:03:15.290> bad

00:03:15.309 --> 00:03:15.319 
car but I mean it's not that it's a bad

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:17.199 
car but I mean it's not that it's a bad
lay<00:03:15.620> it<00:03:15.769> feels<00:03:15.980> it's<00:03:16.190> really<00:03:16.459> easy<00:03:16.700> to<00:03:16.879> drive

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:17.209

lay it feels it's really easy to drive
this<00:03:17.420> car<00:03:17.660> and<00:03:18.109> I<00:03:18.260> imagine<00:03:18.680> that's<00:03:18.859> the<00:03:18.980> reason

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.250 
this car and I imagine that's the reason

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:22.150 
this car and I imagine that's the reason
why<00:03:19.370> they<00:03:19.579> made<00:03:19.730> the<00:03:19.849> boss's<00:03:20.440> interior<00:03:21.440> or<00:03:21.980> the

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:22.160 
why they made the boss's interior or the

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:23.890 
why they made the boss's interior or the
clutch<00:03:22.370> lighter<00:03:22.760> just<00:03:23.150> because<00:03:23.390> they<00:03:23.569> are

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:23.900 
clutch lighter just because they are

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:25.210 
clutch lighter just because they are
expecting<00:03:24.140> this<00:03:24.349> to<00:03:24.470> be<00:03:24.500> used<00:03:24.739> for<00:03:24.829> track<00:03:25.190> use
