able to set our defense and our defense
was<00:00:34.020> pretty<00:00:34.230> good<00:00:34.380> I<00:00:34.590> think<00:00:34.739> we<00:00:34.890> did<00:00:35.010> a<00:00:35.040> good

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
was pretty good I think we did a good

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.590 
was pretty good I think we did a good
job<00:00:35.219> keeping<00:00:35.550> about<00:00:35.760> a<00:00:35.790> transition<00:00:36.300> they've

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
job keeping about a transition they've

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.209 
job keeping about a transition they've
been<00:00:37.079> doing<00:00:37.290> a<00:00:37.350> great<00:00:37.500> job<00:00:37.530> getting<00:00:37.860> up<00:00:38.070> and

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
been doing a great job getting up and

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.790 
been doing a great job getting up and
down<00:00:38.660> getting<00:00:39.660> defensive<00:00:39.899> scrambling<00:00:40.530> I

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
down getting defensive scrambling I

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.380 
down getting defensive scrambling I
think<00:00:41.309> when<00:00:41.489> we<00:00:41.579> set<00:00:41.790> our<00:00:41.879> defense<00:00:42.210> we're

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
think when we set our defense we're

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.810 
think when we set our defense we're
tough<00:00:42.870> to<00:00:42.989> score<00:00:43.200> on<00:00:43.260> so<00:00:43.590> did<00:00:44.550> a<00:00:44.579> great<00:00:44.789> job
