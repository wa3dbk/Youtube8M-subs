00:01:28.679 --> 00:01:28.689 
I mean you can use about three or four

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:59.240 
I mean you can use about three or four
of<00:01:28.750> those<00:01:28.840> different<00:01:29.229> bands<00:01:30.189> and<00:01:57.869> exactly<00:01:58.869> for

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
of those different bands and exactly for

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:29.840 
of those different bands and exactly for
darkmount<00:02:00.250> of<00:02:00.399> different<00:02:11.280> places<00:02:27.690> just

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
darkmount of different places just

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:35.970 
darkmount of different places just
something<00:02:30.850> so<00:02:31.090> simple<00:02:31.389> is<00:02:34.769> can<00:02:35.769> make
