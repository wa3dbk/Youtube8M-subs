00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
think it was really that important in

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:12.980 
think it was really that important in
terms<00:00:11.700> of<00:00:11.849> the<00:00:11.910> bigger<00:00:12.090> scheme<00:00:12.420> I<00:00:12.450> think<00:00:12.660> I

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
terms of the bigger scheme I think I

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:14.629 
terms of the bigger scheme I think I
think<00:00:13.259> I<00:00:13.380> would<00:00:13.950> have<00:00:14.070> at<00:00:14.190> least<00:00:14.219> been<00:00:14.460> a

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
think I would have at least been a

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.050 
think I would have at least been a
favorite<00:00:15.120> to<00:00:15.719> win<00:00:15.960> tomorrow<00:00:16.289> but<00:00:16.440> certainly

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:17.060 
favorite to win tomorrow but certainly

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:20.179 
favorite to win tomorrow but certainly
after<00:00:18.060> having<00:00:18.359> played<00:00:18.600> 11<00:00:19.350> games<00:00:19.380> in<00:00:19.710> 12<00:00:19.980> days

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189

I<00:00:23.430> would<00:00:23.519> have<00:00:23.580> been<00:00:23.699> the<00:00:23.760> favor<00:00:23.939> just<00:00:24.240> to<00:00:24.390> not

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
I would have been the favor just to not

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.120 
I would have been the favor just to not
have<00:00:24.869> to<00:00:24.990> play<00:00:25.109> extra<00:00:25.410> games<00:00:25.560> is<00:00:25.740> really<00:00:25.949> quite

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
seemed like the perfect position given

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:29.660 
seemed like the perfect position given
the<00:00:28.199> tournament<00:00:28.560> situation<00:00:28.740> you<00:00:29.279> can<00:00:29.460> only

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
the tournament situation you can only

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.070 
the tournament situation you can only
have<00:00:29.939> two<00:00:30.150> results<00:00:30.480> where<00:00:30.779> you're<00:00:30.900> pretty

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080

pleased with what happened in the course
of<00:00:32.399> the<00:00:32.489> opening<00:00:32.790> um<00:00:33.270> I<00:00:33.630> think<00:00:33.719> I<00:00:33.960> would<00:00:34.110> have

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
of the opening um I think I would have

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.389 
of the opening um I think I would have
been<00:00:34.320> pleased<00:00:34.559> if<00:00:34.710> I'd<00:00:34.800> time<00:00:35.070> to<00:00:35.190> really

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
been pleased if I'd time to really

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.270 
been pleased if I'd time to really
digest<00:00:35.610> it<00:00:36.090> but<00:00:36.120> I<00:00:36.329> mean<00:00:36.980> it<00:00:37.980> seemed<00:00:38.219> like

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
digest it but I mean it seemed like

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.369 
digest it but I mean it seemed like
right<00:00:38.640> at<00:00:38.790> the<00:00:38.910> start<00:00:39.270> when<00:00:39.870> it<00:00:39.989> when<00:00:40.110> I<00:00:40.140> looked

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
right at the start when it when I looked

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:41.840 
right at the start when it when I looked
at<00:00:40.440> Ray's<00:00:40.649> game<00:00:40.920> it's<00:00:41.160> already<00:00:41.399> better<00:00:41.610> or

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
at Ray's game it's already better or

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.090 
at Ray's game it's already better or
winning<00:00:42.090> or<00:00:42.360> something<00:00:42.870> so<00:00:43.079> I<00:00:43.110> mean<00:00:43.320> I<00:00:43.500> didn't

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
winning or something so I mean I didn't

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.430 
winning or something so I mean I didn't
really<00:00:44.219> have<00:00:44.340> time<00:00:44.550> to<00:00:44.820> sort<00:00:45.480> of<00:00:45.570> enjoy<00:00:46.020> the

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
really have time to sort of enjoy the

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:47.959 
really have time to sort of enjoy the
position<00:00:46.770> I<00:00:46.829> had<00:00:47.039> because<00:00:47.370> Ray<00:00:47.579> would<00:00:47.730> seem<00:00:47.879> to

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
position I had because Ray would seem to

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.119 
position I had because Ray would seem to
be<00:00:48.090> winning<00:00:48.239> right<00:00:48.510> out<00:00:48.660> of<00:00:48.690> the<00:00:48.840> opening<00:00:49.230> that

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
be winning right out of the opening that

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.380 
be winning right out of the opening that
being<00:00:50.340> said<00:00:50.550> though<00:00:50.760> considering<00:00:51.210> the

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
being said though considering the

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.270 
being said though considering the
tournament<00:00:52.050> situation<00:00:52.199> was<00:00:52.620> quite<00:00:52.829> nice<00:00:52.980> to

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
tournament situation was quite nice to

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.490 
tournament situation was quite nice to
just<00:00:53.460> be<00:00:53.760> playing<00:00:54.180> for<00:00:54.360> two<00:00:54.449> results<00:00:54.870> and<00:00:55.020> the

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
just be playing for two results and the

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:56.840 
just be playing for two results and the
fact<00:00:55.649> that<00:00:55.770> Ray<00:00:55.980> was<00:00:56.129> winning<00:00:56.430> so<00:00:56.579> early<00:00:56.820> on

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
fact that Ray was winning so early on

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.459 
fact that Ray was winning so early on
did<00:00:57.120> that<00:00:57.239> influence<00:00:57.420> any<00:00:57.870> of<00:00:58.050> the<00:00:58.140> moves<00:00:58.350> you

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
did that influence any of the moves you

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.979 
did that influence any of the moves you
made<00:00:58.620> today<00:00:58.800> um<00:00:59.489> not<00:01:00.030> really<00:01:00.329> I<00:01:00.510> mean<00:01:00.570> Alex

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
made today um not really I mean Alex

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.990 
made today um not really I mean Alex
surprised<00:01:01.320> me<00:01:01.500> so<00:01:01.649> kind<00:01:01.890> of<00:01:02.010> my<00:01:02.250> mindset<00:01:02.789> was

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
surprised me so kind of my mindset was

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.910 
surprised me so kind of my mindset was
just<00:01:03.149> to<00:01:03.210> try<00:01:03.420> and<00:01:03.449> steer<00:01:03.809> it<00:01:03.840> to<00:01:04.260> steer<00:01:04.799> the

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
just to try and steer it to steer the

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.760 
just to try and steer it to steer the
game<00:01:05.040> into<00:01:05.250> calmer<00:01:05.610> waters<00:01:05.970> and<00:01:06.240> I<00:01:06.750> mean<00:01:07.530> I<00:01:07.590> saw

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
game into calmer waters and I mean I saw

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.800 
game into calmer waters and I mean I saw
a<00:01:07.799> position<00:01:08.189> where<00:01:08.280> I<00:01:08.310> had<00:01:08.520> but<00:01:08.729> there<00:01:08.909> I<00:01:09.180> kind

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
a position where I had but there I kind

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.050 
a position where I had but there I kind
of<00:01:09.930> didn't<00:01:10.229> really<00:01:11.070> have<00:01:11.220> many<00:01:11.400> options<00:01:11.640> in<00:01:11.970> my

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
of didn't really have many options in my

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.880 
of didn't really have many options in my
game<00:01:12.270> I<00:01:12.299> mean<00:01:12.540> if<00:01:12.659> I<00:01:12.900> had<00:01:13.049> options<00:01:13.500> to<00:01:13.650> kind<00:01:13.830> of

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
game I mean if I had options to kind of

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.710 
game I mean if I had options to kind of
go<00:01:14.100> a<00:01:14.369> certain<00:01:14.880> way<00:01:15.060> maybe<00:01:15.360> I<00:01:15.479> would<00:01:15.630> have

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
go a certain way maybe I would have

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.390 
go a certain way maybe I would have
played<00:01:15.900> differently<00:01:16.290> but<00:01:16.650> it's<00:01:16.950> kind<00:01:17.250> of<00:01:17.310> a

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
played differently but it's kind of a

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.039 
played differently but it's kind of a
situation<00:01:17.970> where<00:01:18.360> I<00:01:18.390> just<00:01:18.570> had<00:01:18.659> to<00:01:18.750> find<00:01:18.900> the

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
situation where I just had to find the

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.050 
situation where I just had to find the
best<00:01:19.200> move<00:01:19.470> so<00:01:19.680> there<00:01:20.009> weren't<00:01:20.400> opportunities

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
best move so there weren't opportunities

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.300 
best move so there weren't opportunities
to<00:01:21.180> play<00:01:21.390> like<00:01:21.600> you<00:01:22.080> know<00:01:22.170> tap<00:01:22.470> play<00:01:23.040> something

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
to play like you know tap play something

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.100 
to play like you know tap play something
aggressive<00:01:23.460> it's<00:01:23.850> just<00:01:24.000> it<00:01:24.119> was<00:01:24.210> a<00:01:24.270> egg<00:01:24.840> game

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
aggressive it's just it was a egg game

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:25.580 
aggressive it's just it was a egg game
pretty<00:01:25.290> much

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
pretty much

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:26.960 
pretty much
is<00:01:25.979> there<00:01:26.220> a<00:01:26.250> little<00:01:26.430> piece<00:01:26.640> of<00:01:26.850> you<00:01:26.939> that

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
is there a little piece of you that

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.310 
is there a little piece of you that
wanted<00:01:27.299> to<00:01:27.390> show<00:01:27.540> off<00:01:27.689> some<00:01:27.720> of<00:01:27.960> your<00:01:28.049> blitz

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
wanted to show off some of your blitz

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.940 
wanted to show off some of your blitz
and<00:01:28.470> rapid<00:01:28.770> kills<00:01:28.979> um<00:01:29.990> perhaps<00:01:30.990> I<00:01:31.350> mean<00:01:31.500> I<00:01:31.590> felt

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
and rapid kills um perhaps I mean I felt

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.649 
and rapid kills um perhaps I mean I felt
kind<00:01:32.159> of<00:01:32.189> like<00:01:32.280> I<00:01:32.460> did<00:01:32.579> in<00:01:32.700> Gibraltar<00:01:33.210> actually

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
kind of like I did in Gibraltar actually

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.480 
kind of like I did in Gibraltar actually
you<00:01:33.750> know<00:01:33.840> at<00:01:33.930> the<00:01:34.020> end<00:01:34.170> I<00:01:34.350> think<00:01:34.409> how<00:01:34.680> how<00:01:35.189> had

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
you know at the end I think how how had

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.130 
you know at the end I think how how had
a<00:01:35.520> chance<00:01:35.790> to<00:01:35.909> catch<00:01:36.030> me<00:01:36.270> obviously<00:01:36.600> Robson

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
a chance to catch me obviously Robson

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.140 
a chance to catch me obviously Robson
rate<00:01:37.650> didn't<00:01:37.860> have<00:01:37.979> a<00:01:38.009> chance<00:01:38.250> here<00:01:38.490> but<00:01:38.700> you

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
rate didn't have a chance here but you

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.120 
rate didn't have a chance here but you
know<00:01:39.240> I<00:01:39.270> drew<00:01:39.869> Howlin<00:01:40.229> a<00:01:40.320> long<00:01:40.530> game<00:01:40.770> there<00:01:40.979> and

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
know I drew Howlin a long game there and

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.249 
know I drew Howlin a long game there and
I<00:01:41.189> wasn't<00:01:41.340> happy<00:01:41.790> and<00:01:41.880> I<00:01:42.150> also<00:01:42.479> drew<00:01:42.810> ray<00:01:42.990> here

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
I wasn't happy and I also drew ray here

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.990 
I wasn't happy and I also drew ray here
so<00:01:43.590> maybe<00:01:44.460> not<00:01:44.700> from<00:01:44.880> the<00:01:44.939> standpoint<00:01:45.210> of

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:47.000 
so maybe not from the standpoint of

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.270 
so maybe not from the standpoint of
necessarily<00:01:48.170> showing<00:01:49.170> off<00:01:49.350> but<00:01:49.560> just<00:01:49.619> to<00:01:49.920> just

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
necessarily showing off but just to just

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.859 
necessarily showing off but just to just
to<00:01:50.369> beat<00:01:50.610> beat<00:01:50.880> him<00:01:51.090> since<00:01:51.299> I<00:01:51.390> fail<00:01:51.570> to<00:01:51.750> do<00:01:51.840> it

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
to beat beat him since I fail to do it

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.480 
to beat beat him since I fail to do it
in<00:01:52.020> the<00:01:52.110> main<00:01:52.259> tournament<00:01:52.530> that<00:01:53.040> being<00:01:53.310> said

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
in the main tournament that being said

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.850 
in the main tournament that being said
it's<00:01:53.700> not<00:01:53.759> not<00:01:54.540> that<00:01:54.750> big<00:01:54.930> of<00:01:54.960> a<00:01:55.110> deal<00:01:55.259> between

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
it's not not that big of a deal between

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.770 
it's not not that big of a deal between
Gibraltar<00:01:56.549> Zurich<00:01:56.909> and<00:01:57.030> st.<00:01:57.270> Louis<00:01:57.600> you've

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
Gibraltar Zurich and st. Louis you've

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.060 
Gibraltar Zurich and st. Louis you've
gone<00:01:57.930> three<00:01:58.259> for<00:01:58.500> three<00:01:58.740> can<00:01:58.890> you<00:01:58.950> remember

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
gone three for three can you remember

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.590 
gone three for three can you remember
the<00:01:59.250> last<00:01:59.399> time<00:01:59.549> you<00:01:59.759> won<00:01:59.939> three<00:02:00.149> tournaments

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
the last time you won three tournaments

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.350 
the last time you won three tournaments
in<00:02:00.659> a<00:02:00.719> row<00:02:00.750> I<00:02:01.079> don't<00:02:01.920> think<00:02:02.040> I<00:02:02.100> ever<00:02:02.130> have<00:02:02.549> it's

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
in a row I don't think I ever have it's

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.209 
in a row I don't think I ever have it's
maybe<00:02:03.689> I<00:02:03.780> tied<00:02:04.020> for<00:02:04.229> first<00:02:04.439> and<00:02:04.920> some<00:02:05.070> of<00:02:05.159> the

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
maybe I tied for first and some of the

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.789 
maybe I tied for first and some of the
opens<00:02:05.610> back<00:02:05.820> in<00:02:05.969> the<00:02:06.060> old<00:02:06.210> days<00:02:06.450> but<00:02:06.750> I<00:02:07.229> think

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
opens back in the old days but I think

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.080 
opens back in the old days but I think
it's<00:02:07.920> fairly<00:02:08.340> unlikely

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
it's fairly unlikely

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.059 
it's fairly unlikely
that<00:02:09.390> I<00:02:09.420> ever<00:02:09.690> went<00:02:09.899> through<00:02:09.989> in<00:02:10.170> a<00:02:10.229> row<00:02:10.379> and<00:02:10.739> I

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
that I ever went through in a row and I

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:12.350 
that I ever went through in a row and I
said<00:02:11.310> you'd<00:02:11.430> sacrifice<00:02:11.940> all<00:02:12.120> of<00:02:12.150> these

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
said you'd sacrifice all of these

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.729 
said you'd sacrifice all of these
victories<00:02:12.750> for<00:02:12.959> a<00:02:12.989> victory<00:02:13.319> in<00:02:13.410> the<00:02:13.500> feed<00:02:13.650> a

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:13.739 
victories for a victory in the feed a

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:15.860 
victories for a victory in the feed a
Grand<00:02:14.040> Prix<00:02:14.310> you<00:02:14.940> almost<00:02:15.180> made<00:02:15.480> it<00:02:15.569> seem<00:02:15.720> like

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
Grand Prix you almost made it seem like

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.240 
Grand Prix you almost made it seem like
it<00:02:15.989> was<00:02:16.019> a<00:02:16.110> bad<00:02:16.349> omen<00:02:16.379> that<00:02:16.800> you're<00:02:17.010> waiting

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
it was a bad omen that you're waiting

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.520 
it was a bad omen that you're waiting
for<00:02:17.280> the<00:02:17.489> shoe<00:02:17.700> to<00:02:17.730> drop<00:02:17.849> or<00:02:18.209> something<00:02:18.470> do<00:02:19.470> you

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
for the shoe to drop or something do you

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.290 
for the shoe to drop or something do you
feel<00:02:19.709> like<00:02:19.860> the<00:02:20.160> momentum<00:02:20.580> is<00:02:20.730> more<00:02:20.940> important

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
feel like the momentum is more important

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.809 
feel like the momentum is more important
than<00:02:21.360> any<00:02:21.540> sort<00:02:21.780> of<00:02:22.310> bad<00:02:23.310> thoughts<00:02:23.580> or

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
than any sort of bad thoughts or

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:26.059 
than any sort of bad thoughts or
anything<00:02:24.000> I<00:02:24.269> mean<00:02:24.810> I<00:02:24.959> think<00:02:25.349> a<00:02:25.590> general<00:02:25.799> is

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069 
anything I mean I think a general is

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:28.250 
anything I mean I think a general is
just<00:02:26.239> you<00:02:27.239> don't<00:02:27.540> usually<00:02:27.660> win<00:02:27.959> this<00:02:28.049> many

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
just you don't usually win this many

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.229 
just you don't usually win this many
terms<00:02:28.500> in<00:02:28.769> a<00:02:28.830> row<00:02:28.980> unless<00:02:29.129> maybe<00:02:29.459> your<00:02:29.940> name<00:02:30.090> is

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:30.239 
terms in a row unless maybe your name is

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:33.979 
terms in a row unless maybe your name is
Magnus<00:02:30.720> but<00:02:31.650> in<00:02:32.129> general<00:02:32.580> I<00:02:32.629> think<00:02:33.629> for<00:02:33.930> the

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:33.989 
Magnus but in general I think for the

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:35.420 
Magnus but in general I think for the
most<00:02:34.140> part<00:02:34.290> I<00:02:34.470> played<00:02:34.680> the<00:02:34.769> best<00:02:34.920> chess<00:02:35.190> here

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
most part I played the best chess here

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.729 
most part I played the best chess here
so<00:02:35.730> I<00:02:35.970> think<00:02:36.209> I<00:02:36.390> deserved<00:02:36.720> it<00:02:36.870> but<00:02:37.140> again<00:02:37.319> I

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:37.739 
so I think I deserved it but again I

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:39.890 
so I think I deserved it but again I
think<00:02:38.190> I<00:02:38.430> can<00:02:38.580> do<00:02:38.700> better<00:02:38.879> than<00:02:39.090> this<00:02:39.239> and<00:02:39.540> I

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
think I can do better than this and I

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.270 
think I can do better than this and I
think<00:02:40.110> I'm<00:02:40.290> gonna<00:02:40.410> have<00:02:40.620> to<00:02:40.769> do<00:02:40.890> better<00:02:41.040> than

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
think I'm gonna have to do better than

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:42.860 
think I'm gonna have to do better than
this<00:02:41.430> in<00:02:41.640> the<00:02:41.700> Grand<00:02:41.910> Prix<00:02:42.120> how<00:02:42.540> much<00:02:42.720> have<00:02:42.840> you

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
this in the Grand Prix how much have you

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.089 
this in the Grand Prix how much have you
looked<00:02:43.110> at<00:02:43.200> the<00:02:43.260> numbers<00:02:43.590> do<00:02:43.739> you<00:02:43.799> know<00:02:43.950> what

00:02:44.089 --> 00:02:44.099 
looked at the numbers do you know what

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:45.410 
looked at the numbers do you know what
placement<00:02:44.519> you<00:02:44.579> have<00:02:44.730> to<00:02:44.910> finish<00:02:45.090> in<00:02:45.329> the

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
placement you have to finish in the

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.449 
placement you have to finish in the
final<00:02:45.720> feed<00:02:45.930> a<00:02:46.019> grand<00:02:46.290> prix<00:02:46.440> event<00:02:46.769> to<00:02:46.980> qualify

for<00:02:47.489> the<00:02:47.760> candidates<00:02:48.180> well<00:02:48.690> I<00:02:48.720> think<00:02:48.840> I<00:02:48.989> just

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:49.019 
for the candidates well I think I just

have to finish ahead of thomashefsky or

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:53.270 
have to finish ahead of thomashefsky or
Caruana<00:02:51.000> to<00:02:51.299> guarantee<00:02:51.959> a<00:02:51.989> spot<00:02:52.200> so<00:02:52.650> I<00:02:52.920> mean

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
Caruana to guarantee a spot so I mean

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:54.440 
Caruana to guarantee a spot so I mean
obviously<00:02:53.640> they're<00:02:53.790> both<00:02:53.819> playing<00:02:54.239> they're

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
obviously they're both playing they're

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.030 
obviously they're both playing they're
both<00:02:54.599> very<00:02:54.810> strong<00:02:55.019> players<00:02:55.410> and<00:02:55.799> we'll<00:02:55.890> see

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
both very strong players and we'll see

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.670 
both very strong players and we'll see
what<00:02:56.160> happens<00:02:56.549> but<00:02:56.640> I<00:02:57.269> think<00:02:57.959> if<00:02:58.019> I<00:02:58.079> play<00:02:58.319> play

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
what happens but I think if I play play

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.650 
what happens but I think if I play play
well<00:02:58.890> good<00:02:59.190> things<00:02:59.370> will<00:02:59.519> happen<00:02:59.549> you<00:03:00.510> say

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
well good things will happen you say

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:01.970 
well good things will happen you say
this<00:03:00.780> tournament<00:03:01.140> was<00:03:01.230> incredibly<00:03:01.680> stressful

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
this tournament was incredibly stressful

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:03.470 
this tournament was incredibly stressful
because<00:03:02.280> even<00:03:02.489> a<00:03:02.549> draw<00:03:02.790> would<00:03:02.970> lose<00:03:03.180> three

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
because even a draw would lose three

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.600 
because even a draw would lose three
points<00:03:03.870> can<00:03:04.290> we<00:03:04.379> expect<00:03:04.709> you<00:03:04.890> back<00:03:05.069> next<00:03:05.430> year

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
points can we expect you back next year

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:06.890 
points can we expect you back next year
it<00:03:05.700> will<00:03:05.790> depend<00:03:06.239> on<00:03:06.329> some<00:03:06.540> other<00:03:06.660> things

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
it will depend on some other things

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.140 
it will depend on some other things
going<00:03:07.019> on<00:03:07.260> in<00:03:07.379> your<00:03:07.410> career<00:03:07.620> um<00:03:08.519> well<00:03:08.819> I<00:03:08.849> mean<00:03:08.970> I

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
going on in your career um well I mean I

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.300 
going on in your career um well I mean I
think<00:03:09.299> it's<00:03:10.170> fairly<00:03:10.440> likely<00:03:10.709> I'll<00:03:10.980> be<00:03:11.099> back

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
think it's fairly likely I'll be back

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:14.030 
think it's fairly likely I'll be back
but<00:03:12.000> but<00:03:12.180> again<00:03:12.269> obviously<00:03:13.019> everything<00:03:13.829> seems

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
but but again obviously everything seems

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:15.500 
but but again obviously everything seems
to<00:03:14.130> depend<00:03:14.370> on<00:03:14.519> the<00:03:14.609> feed<00:03:14.760> a<00:03:14.819> cycle<00:03:15.269> and<00:03:15.389> when

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
to depend on the feed a cycle and when

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.539 
to depend on the feed a cycle and when
the<00:03:15.600> tournaments<00:03:16.049> are<00:03:16.200> so<00:03:16.470> so<00:03:16.920> who<00:03:17.069> knows<00:03:17.310> but

00:03:17.539 --> 00:03:17.549 
the tournaments are so so who knows but

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:19.069 
the tournaments are so so who knows but
but<00:03:17.790> assuming<00:03:18.150> that<00:03:18.329> there<00:03:18.420> are<00:03:18.480> no<00:03:18.540> conflicts

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:19.079 
but assuming that there are no conflicts

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:20.960 
but assuming that there are no conflicts
I<00:03:19.170> think<00:03:19.319> it's<00:03:19.440> fairly<00:03:19.859> fairly<00:03:20.519> likely<00:03:20.730> that

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
I think it's fairly fairly likely that

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:22.460 
I think it's fairly fairly likely that
I'll<00:03:21.060> compete<00:03:21.510> not<00:03:21.660> sure<00:03:21.930> you're<00:03:22.260> doing

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
I'll compete not sure you're doing

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:24.080 
I'll compete not sure you're doing
really<00:03:22.709> well<00:03:22.859> where<00:03:23.489> do<00:03:23.549> you<00:03:23.579> spend<00:03:23.880> all<00:03:24.030> your

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
really well where do you spend all your

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
money do you have any vices or any kind

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.220 
money do you have any vices or any kind
of<00:03:26.599> restaurants<00:03:27.599> or<00:03:27.720> anything<00:03:27.900> that<00:03:28.139> you're

of restaurants or anything that you're

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:32.330 
of restaurants or anything that you're
gonna<00:03:28.319> take<00:03:28.560> yourself<00:03:28.709> out<00:03:29.069> to<00:03:30.500> I<00:03:31.500> mean<00:03:32.130> not

gonna take yourself out to I mean not

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:34.109 
really I mean I just take my money in

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:36.229 
really I mean I just take my money in
but<00:03:34.290> and<00:03:34.470> invest<00:03:35.069> it<00:03:35.250> so<00:03:35.489> that's<00:03:35.849> that's

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:36.239 
but and invest it so that's that's

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:38.870 
but and invest it so that's that's
generally<00:03:36.690> what<00:03:36.840> I'll<00:03:36.959> do<00:03:37.139> I<00:03:37.530> have<00:03:38.190> it<00:03:38.519> is<00:03:38.730> of

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:38.880 
generally what I'll do I have it is of

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:40.460 
generally what I'll do I have it is of
course<00:03:39.030> tax<00:03:39.389> time<00:03:39.690> so<00:03:39.930> certainly<00:03:40.230> it's<00:03:40.349> nice

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
course tax time so certainly it's nice

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:07.430 
probably in the middle tournament was
when<00:04:05.730> it<00:04:06.209> was<00:04:06.389> the<00:04:06.510> most<00:04:06.690> stressful<00:04:06.870> impact

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.440 
when it was the most stressful impact

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:09.259 
when it was the most stressful impact
because<00:04:07.590> on<00:04:07.799> top<00:04:07.980> of<00:04:08.040> the<00:04:08.430> tournament<00:04:08.910> I<00:04:08.970> kind

would be nice I I haven't heard any

00:05:39.349 --> 00:05:40.480 
would be nice I I haven't heard any

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:40.490 
reason to believe it's actually gonna be

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:42.640 
reason to believe it's actually gonna be
in<00:05:40.669> the<00:05:40.789> US<00:05:41.090> frankly<00:05:41.570> so<00:05:41.840> I'm<00:05:42.349> fairly

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:42.650 
in the US frankly so I'm fairly

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:44.230 
in the US frankly so I'm fairly
skeptical<00:05:43.130> like<00:05:43.460> I<00:05:43.639> am<00:05:43.759> just<00:05:44.030> about

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:44.240 
skeptical like I am just about

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:46.510 
skeptical like I am just about
everything<00:05:44.509> fidei<00:05:44.930> does<00:05:45.139> but<00:05:45.560> if<00:05:46.039> it<00:05:46.219> is<00:05:46.340> in

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:46.520 
everything fidei does but if it is in

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:48.700 
everything fidei does but if it is in
the<00:05:46.580> u.s.<00:05:46.880> it's<00:05:47.060> in<00:05:47.180> the<00:05:47.300> US<00:05:47.599> but<00:05:48.229> hopefully<00:05:48.680> I

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:48.710 
the u.s. it's in the US but hopefully I

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:50.800 
the u.s. it's in the US but hopefully I
can<00:05:48.830> qualify<00:05:49.250> it<00:05:49.759> suffice<00:05:50.060> to<00:05:50.270> say<00:05:50.300> if<00:05:50.570> you<00:05:50.659> win

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:50.810 
can qualify it suffice to say if you win

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:52.240 
can qualify it suffice to say if you win
the<00:05:50.960> candidates<00:05:51.409> you<00:05:51.560> probably<00:05:51.979> don't<00:05:52.190> care

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:52.250 
the candidates you probably don't care

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:53.680 
the candidates you probably don't care
too<00:05:52.580> much<00:05:52.759> where<00:05:52.940> do<00:05:53.000> you<00:05:53.090> play<00:05:53.240> you'll<00:05:53.389> be<00:05:53.509> so

excited to get there well I think if I

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:58.360

were to win the candidates I would I

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:00.490 
were to win the candidates I would I
would<00:05:58.460> want<00:05:58.669> to<00:05:58.759> play<00:05:59.139> somewhere<00:06:00.139> like<00:06:00.289> New

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:02.090 
York probably or maybe California

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:04.480 
York probably or maybe California
actually<00:06:02.719> um<00:06:03.229> since<00:06:04.039> I've<00:06:04.190> been<00:06:04.280> out<00:06:04.430> there

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:04.490

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:06.760 
actually um since I've been out there
quite<00:06:04.789> a<00:06:04.819> bit<00:06:05.030> recently<00:06:05.210> but<00:06:05.719> for<00:06:06.530> the<00:06:06.590> most

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:06.770 
quite a bit recently but for the most

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:08.230 
quite a bit recently but for the most
part<00:06:07.039> just<00:06:07.069> just<00:06:07.430> getting<00:06:07.580> there<00:06:07.819> is<00:06:07.909> the<00:06:07.940> goal

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:08.240 
part just just getting there is the goal

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:10.300 
part just just getting there is the goal
and<00:06:08.419> I<00:06:08.630> mean<00:06:08.780> as<00:06:09.169> we<00:06:09.349> saw<00:06:09.500> even<00:06:09.650> with<00:06:09.830> Magnus

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:10.310 
and I mean as we saw even with Magnus

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:12.399 
and I mean as we saw even with Magnus
it's<00:06:10.520> it<00:06:11.270> took<00:06:11.419> him<00:06:11.569> a<00:06:11.630> long<00:06:11.780> time<00:06:12.050> just<00:06:12.199> to<00:06:12.289> get

00:06:12.399 --> 00:06:12.409 
it's it took him a long time just to get

00:06:12.409 --> 00:06:13.629 
it's it took him a long time just to get
to<00:06:12.560> the<00:06:12.620> world<00:06:12.770> championship<00:06:13.219> management

00:06:15.309 --> 00:06:15.319 
there are a lot of hurdles and so if I

00:06:15.319 --> 00:06:17.350 
there are a lot of hurdles and so if I
get<00:06:15.380> there<00:06:15.770> I<00:06:16.009> mean<00:06:16.280> that<00:06:16.490> I<00:06:16.520> it's<00:06:17.060> not<00:06:17.210> gonna
