the<00:01:43.200> scientists<00:01:43.649> created<00:01:44.009> a<00:01:44.070> biodegradable

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
the scientists created a biodegradable

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.030 
the scientists created a biodegradable

so in time the mouse could replace and

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.039 
so in time the mouse could replace and
