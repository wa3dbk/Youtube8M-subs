00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:07.569
 very good I am unique and in this video 

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:10.959
 let's do an untethered jailbreak 

00:00:07.569 --> 00:00:14.320
 an iphone 3gs that has version 6.1 

00:00:10.959 --> 00:00:16.150
 1.6 in this case I have to activate the 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:19.029
 iphone because I do not have the sim card 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:20.949
 original but the process is the same as 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:23.740
 what we have to do is jailbreak 

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:26.619
 tethered through networks none and then 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:29.380
 install a setting in cydia that is called 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:31.749
 proxy spain but for this we have to 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:33.550
 do a little trick we will leave you the 

00:00:31.749 --> 00:00:36.489
 version download links 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:40.270
 compatible networks none and then you have 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:43.390
 also that download firmware 6.0 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:44.890
 of iphone 3gs to have it in the 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:47.940
 computer 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:47.940
 we open networks now 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:53.680
 and we see in the bottom part that we 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:56.030
 it appears that I have a new wood road 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:58.850
 usually it usually always appears 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:01.150
 there with the version that I have installed 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:05.580
 at those moments 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:10.410
 then we have to go into extras 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:14.580
 chelet ipsw we look for the version where 

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:18.830
 let's have the 6.0 of which we had 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.830
 spoken we selected it 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:26.050
 confirms that it is correct and we press 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:26.050
 okay 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:34.290
 asks us if the butron is new or 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:36.780
 old in this case 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:39.140
 I have the new boot round a pulse 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.140
 yes 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:46.340
 we press back to go back once 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:46.340
 we press jailbreak 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:54.799
 we leave marked cydia and press nets 

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:57.740
 now he asks us to leave the iphone in 

00:01:54.799 --> 00:02:00.079
 defe mode tells us that if we know 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:05.860
 we can do it now and if not 

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:05.860
 turn off the iphone and turn it off 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:15.190
 and the next button is enabled 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:17.980
 click next and follow the steps 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:20.920
 they indicate that the button is 10 seconds 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:23.580
 of the power and I leave the screen is going to 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:26.130
 stay in black 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:29.220
 at 10 seconds we release the power 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:32.380
 and the one of hong we keep it pressed until 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:35.190
 that the process starts 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:35.190
 jailbreak 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:43.270
 we can let go 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:43.270
 We are going to give you a quick camera 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:48.870
 until the next window appears 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:51.900
 As you can see on the computer, it's finished 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.850
 but it tells us that when they finish the 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:56.160
 iphone you have to do just but that os 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:58.470
 we explain now how it is done 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:02.360
 we continue to give him a hard fast camera 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:02.360
 about 56 minutes 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:09.200
 in my case I have to activate the iphone 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:11.480
 because I did not have the sim card 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.260
 original when doing the jailbreak do not you the 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.730
 asks 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:16.490
 but in your case if you already have it 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:19.070
 the menu will appear activated you will 

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:21.560
 give forward to fast camera is 

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:23.570
 in that same moment, well, we already 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:25.490
 the iphone menu appears here but not 

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:27.650
 Cydia appears to us because we have to 

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:30.020
 do the juz boot then what 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:31.880
 we have to do is on the computer 

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:36.500
 we go back 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:40.070
 we enter select ipsw and go back to 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:44.990
 select version 6.0 of the iphone 

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:46.760
 3gs press ok click and it's good here 

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:49.130
 first of all I will comment that if 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:51.650
 you have the old butron do not go to 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:54.140
 need to do just wood already 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:56.240
 directly install cydia but if 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:58.520
 we have the new one press the button 

00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:02.750
 just boots and we have to do the same 

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:05.240
 that we turned off the iphone 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:07.940
 We wait for the button to be enabled 

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:10.940
 Next, once we're off, we press the 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:13.820
 next button and we have to follow the 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:16.070
 steps that tells us what to do 

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:19.040
 while the power button and home 10 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:22.580
 seconds the screen turns black 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:24.650
 at 10 seconds we release the power and 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:28.460
 we keep the left they have pressed until 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:30.560
 the just boot process starts 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:33.319
 we will give it again to fast camera 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:35.700
 although this process lasts a little longer or 

00:04:33.319 --> 00:04:38.340
 minus one minute 

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:41.160
 we already have the device turned on 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:44.390
 the computer does not have to do anything else 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:44.390
 we unlock the iphone 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:59.759
 and we wait for cydia to appear 

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:06.220
 does not appear to us we enter it and what 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:08.470
 first thing to do is update 

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:14.310
 the essential elements we select 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:14.310
 next user we wait for him to load 

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:20.040
 We give it to fast camera until it 

00:05:17.449 --> 00:05:22.320
 recharge on all data 

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:26.430
 here we can directly press the 

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:28.500
 button to update essential packages 

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:30.660
 and once they are installed we are going to 

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:33.360
 appear a reset button on the 

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:36.330
 device in case it is restarted and 

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:39.500
 do not let us get into cydia you have to 

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:39.500
 redo the just boot 

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:49.610
 in our case it closed cydia but not 

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:51.230
 the device was started now what 

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:53.680
 you have to do is enter the button 

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:53.680
 search for 

00:05:54.180 --> 00:06:01.080
 and we have to look for proxy spain that with 

00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:03.710
 write a p and a 0 and we see the 

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:03.710
 first option 

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:06.930
 we install it 

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:20.490
 we press install and with this what is going to 

00:06:16.979 --> 00:06:22.930
 to do is to go from jailbreak tethered to 

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:26.169
 untethered 

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:28.990
 and once installed nothing let's turn it off 

00:06:26.169 --> 00:06:32.710
 and turn on the device to check 

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:35.080
 to see if it was the way before 

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:37.210
 that is, we do not have to do the 

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:39.310
 just but every time we restart the 

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:41.880
 device 

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:44.940
 then we turn it off 

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:48.090
 and once turned off we turn it on and go 

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:50.310
 to check if it works we only have 

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:52.350
 to enter cydia and if if 

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:54.600
 open us and that means you have 

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:56.970
 stayed in untethered mode and no longer 

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:59.220
 we have no problem when it comes to 

00:06:56.970 --> 00:07:02.300
 restart the device 

00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:02.300
 we give to fast camera 

00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:06.750
 we already have the menu here we are going to enter 

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:09.960
 in cydia and we see that he loads us with 

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:12.320
 normality well and this is all we hope 

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:14.700
