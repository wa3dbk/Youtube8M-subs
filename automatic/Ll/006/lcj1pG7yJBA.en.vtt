00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:09.710 
you want to first create the cylinder

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:12.490 
you want to first create the cylinder
which<00:00:10.710> is<00:00:10.740> going<00:00:11.070> to<00:00:11.190> be<00:00:11.280> the<00:00:11.370> flagpole

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:12.500 
which is going to be the flagpole

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:19.010 
which is going to be the flagpole
okay<00:00:13.500> so<00:00:13.559> much<00:00:13.950> stands<00:00:14.910> on<00:00:15.059> the<00:00:15.179> z-axis<00:00:18.020> there

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
okay so much stands on the z-axis there

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.290 
okay so much stands on the z-axis there
we<00:00:19.109> go<00:00:19.289> lovely<00:00:20.250> now<00:00:20.699> we're<00:00:20.820> gonna<00:00:20.910> add<00:00:21.090> that

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.929 
we go lovely now we're gonna add that
flag<00:00:21.810> which<00:00:22.020> is<00:00:22.199> gonna<00:00:22.380> be<00:00:22.560> a<00:00:23.570> plane<00:00:24.570> and<00:00:25.939> we

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
flag which is gonna be a plane and we

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:37.670 
flag which is gonna be a plane and we
are<00:00:27.119> gonna<00:00:29.929> rotate<00:00:30.929> this<00:00:31.910> plane<00:00:33.710> on<00:00:36.680> y-axis

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
are gonna rotate this plane on y-axis

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.569 
are gonna rotate this plane on y-axis
you<00:00:39.140> don't<00:00:40.140> go<00:00:40.469> straight<00:00:41.040> as<00:00:41.129> you<00:00:41.190> can't<00:00:41.399> an

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
line with the flag pole okay okay it's

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.010 
line with the flag pole okay okay it's
in<00:00:55.680> line<00:00:55.860> now<00:00:56.300> now<00:00:57.300> we're<00:00:57.420> going<00:00:57.539> to<00:00:57.600> stretch

in line now now we're going to stretch
out<00:00:58.260> the<00:00:58.289> flag<00:00:58.890> to<00:00:59.460> proper<00:00:59.910> size<00:01:00.320> they<00:01:01.320> should

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
out the flag to proper size they should

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:09.710 
out the flag to proper size they should
do<00:01:03.830> there<00:01:04.830> we<00:01:04.890> go<00:01:05.510> now<00:01:06.510> we<00:01:06.570> have<00:01:07.080> our<00:01:07.560> flag<00:01:08.720> so

do there we go now we have our flag so

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.899 
do there we go now we have our flag so
here<00:01:10.409> we<00:01:10.500> are<00:01:10.530> guys<00:01:10.799> that<00:01:11.189> was<00:01:11.430> the<00:01:11.580> end<00:01:11.700> of<00:01:11.820> the

what<00:02:09.049> I<00:02:09.080> like<00:02:09.289> to<00:02:09.440> is<00:02:09.590> leave<00:02:09.799> a<00:02:09.829> little<00:02:10.009> gap<00:02:10.340> so

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
what I like to is leave a little gap so

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:13.210 
what I like to is leave a little gap so
the<00:02:11.239> actual<00:02:11.870> it<00:02:12.410> looks<00:02:12.590> like<00:02:12.739> it's<00:02:12.950> connected

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
the actual it looks like it's connected

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.110 
the actual it looks like it's connected
here<00:02:13.849> and<00:02:14.440> here<00:02:15.470> so<00:02:16.400> actually<00:02:16.730> looks<00:02:16.910> like<00:02:17.000> a

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
here and here so actually looks like a

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.539 
here and here so actually looks like a
proper<00:02:17.480> flag<00:02:18.340> okay

00:02:19.539 --> 00:02:19.549 
proper flag okay

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:21.339 
proper flag okay
know<00:02:19.910> what<00:02:20.030> you<00:02:20.090> want<00:02:20.209> to<00:02:20.299> do<00:02:20.450> now<00:02:20.660> is<00:02:20.900> go<00:02:21.290> to

00:02:21.339 --> 00:02:21.349 
know what you want to do now is go to

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:26.890 
know what you want to do now is go to
the<00:02:21.530> physics<00:02:22.069> and<00:02:22.840> choose<00:02:23.840> a<00:02:23.870> cloth<00:02:25.630> now<00:02:26.630> what

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
the physics and choose a cloth now what

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.110 
the physics and choose a cloth now what
this<00:02:27.019> will<00:02:27.079> do<00:02:27.380> right<00:02:28.160> now<00:02:28.340> I<00:02:28.370> will<00:02:28.610> just<00:02:28.670> flop

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
this will do right now I will just flop

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:34.479 
this will do right now I will just flop
all<00:02:29.420> the<00:02:29.569> way<00:02:29.660> down<00:02:31.150> like<00:02:32.150> so<00:02:32.510> now<00:02:33.470> to<00:02:33.530> attach

00:02:34.479 --> 00:02:34.489 
all the way down like so now to attach

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:36.129 
all the way down like so now to attach
this<00:02:34.700> you<00:02:34.940> need<00:02:35.060> to<00:02:35.150> click<00:02:35.269> pinning<00:02:35.900> and

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:36.139 
this you need to click pinning and

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
now as you can see it's a bit pixelated

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.800 
now as you can see it's a bit pixelated

can see alright so now we want an actual

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:09.860 
can see alright so now we want an actual
wind<00:03:07.510> to<00:03:08.050> make<00:03:08.200> it<00:03:08.350> moving<00:03:08.860> so<00:03:09.190> to<00:03:09.250> add<00:03:09.520> this

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
wind to make it moving so to add this

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:15.540 
wind to make it moving so to add this
add<00:03:11.400> forcefield<00:03:12.400> wind<00:03:13.920> now<00:03:14.920> that<00:03:15.070> add<00:03:15.190> it<00:03:15.340> down

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:15.550 
add forcefield wind now that add it down

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:18.180 
add forcefield wind now that add it down
here<00:03:15.820> and<00:03:16.030> the<00:03:16.870> wind<00:03:17.110> actually<00:03:17.440> shows<00:03:17.830> up<00:03:18.010> with

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:18.190 
here and the wind actually shows up with

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:21.270 
here and the wind actually shows up with
a<00:03:18.280> little<00:03:18.840> little<00:03:19.840> orange<00:03:20.560> arrow<00:03:20.770> here<00:03:21.100> to

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 
a little little orange arrow here to

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.540 
a little little orange arrow here to
direct<00:03:21.550> where<00:03:21.970> the<00:03:22.060> wind<00:03:22.240> is<00:03:22.360> actually<00:03:22.510> going

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:23.550 
direct where the wind is actually going

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:26.670 
direct where the wind is actually going
so<00:03:24.550> let<00:03:24.670> me<00:03:24.760> move<00:03:24.940> this<00:03:25.000> here<00:03:25.270> and<00:03:25.870> rotate<00:03:26.410> it

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:26.680 
so let me move this here and rotate it

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:30.360 
so let me move this here and rotate it
on<00:03:27.660> x-axis<00:03:28.660> paint<00:03:29.200> the<00:03:29.740> point<00:03:30.040> in<00:03:30.130> this<00:03:30.220> way

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:30.370 
on x-axis paint the point in this way

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:33.570 
on x-axis paint the point in this way
sorry<00:03:31.380> now<00:03:32.380> at<00:03:32.620> the<00:03:32.770> moment<00:03:32.950> this<00:03:33.160> is<00:03:33.340> going<00:03:33.520> to

camera now let's bring this up a bit and
now<00:06:37.499> we<00:06:37.529> can<00:06:37.769> rotate<00:06:37.949> this<00:06:38.279> easily<00:06:41.269> okay

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:46.650 

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:48.800 

and<00:06:47.280> let's<00:06:47.460> move<00:06:47.580> this<00:06:47.729> back<00:06:47.910> a<00:06:47.970> bit<00:06:48.240> see<00:06:48.660> what

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:48.810 
and let's move this back a bit see what

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:51.040 
and let's move this back a bit see what
this<00:06:48.930> looks<00:06:49.110> like

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:51.050 
this looks like

there we go

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:55.700 
there we go
surrender<00:06:53.690> surrender<00:06:54.690> it<00:06:55.169> where<00:06:55.320> it's<00:06:55.470> like

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:03.090 
just flowing okay so here we can render

00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:05.900 
just flowing okay so here we can render
this<00:07:03.330> I<00:07:04.310> will<00:07:05.310> see<00:07:05.490> that<00:07:05.520> it's<00:07:05.820> actually
