going to embellish or elaborate on the
sustain<00:04:16.560> talk<00:04:16.890> and<00:04:17.690> one<00:04:18.690> wants<00:04:19.049> to<00:04:19.080> put<00:04:19.290> more

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:19.530 
sustain talk and one wants to put more

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:21.950 
sustain talk and one wants to put more
attention<00:04:19.680> toward<00:04:20.430> the<00:04:20.549> change<00:04:20.850> talk<00:04:21.299> so

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:21.960 
attention toward the change talk so

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:24.170 
attention toward the change talk so
that's<00:04:22.169> being<00:04:22.470> directive<00:04:23.250> I'm<00:04:23.820> going<00:04:23.970> to<00:04:24.030> give

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.180 
that's being directive I'm going to give

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:26.150 
that's being directive I'm going to give
very<00:04:24.450> little<00:04:24.600> attention<00:04:24.840> to<00:04:25.229> this<00:04:25.470> sustained

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:26.160 
very little attention to this sustained

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:27.110 
very little attention to this sustained
talk<00:04:26.520> and

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.120 
talk and

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:28.550 
talk and
more<00:04:27.270> attention<00:04:27.389> and<00:04:27.900> I'm<00:04:28.020> going<00:04:28.260> to<00:04:28.320> try<00:04:28.500> to

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:28.560 
more attention and I'm going to try to

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:31.700 
more attention and I'm going to try to
perhaps<00:04:28.800> elicit<00:04:29.430> Jane's<00:04:30.419> talk<00:04:30.750> as<00:04:30.930> well<00:04:31.080> so<00:04:31.680> I

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:31.710 
perhaps elicit Jane's talk as well so I

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:34.460 
perhaps elicit Jane's talk as well so I
might<00:04:32.070> say<00:04:32.340> after<00:04:32.729> that<00:04:32.880> you<00:04:33.780> know<00:04:33.930> is<00:04:34.199> there

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:34.470 
might say after that you know is there

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:36.080 
might say after that you know is there
anything<00:04:34.710> at<00:04:34.979> all<00:04:35.040> that<00:04:35.340> concerns<00:04:35.820> you<00:04:36.060> about

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:36.090 
anything at all that concerns you about

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:38.240 
anything at all that concerns you about
this<00:04:36.600> you<00:04:36.960> know<00:04:37.080> if<00:04:37.260> you<00:04:37.380> if<00:04:37.560> you<00:04:37.650> left<00:04:37.919> it<00:04:38.100> this

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:38.250 
this you know if you if you left it this

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:41.240 
this you know if you if you left it this
way<00:04:38.490> and<00:04:39.060> if<00:04:39.360> I<00:04:39.479> pick<00:04:39.750> up<00:04:39.780> a<00:04:40.050> little<00:04:40.350> middle<00:04:40.889> of

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:41.250 
way and if I pick up a little middle of

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:44.390 
way and if I pick up a little middle of
anything<00:04:41.790> I've<00:04:42.690> got<00:04:42.750> change<00:04:43.320> talk<00:04:43.860> if<00:04:44.070> I<00:04:44.190> get

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:44.400 
anything I've got change talk if I get

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:46.820 
anything I've got change talk if I get
any<00:04:44.580> kind<00:04:44.940> of<00:04:45.060> an<00:04:45.210> answer<00:04:45.389> and<00:04:45.840> then<00:04:46.350> I<00:04:46.410> can

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:46.830 
any kind of an answer and then I can

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:49.250 
any kind of an answer and then I can
begin<00:04:47.040> to<00:04:47.460> move<00:04:47.669> into<00:04:48.000> the<00:04:48.419> reasons<00:04:48.900> why<00:04:49.199> to

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:49.260 
begin to move into the reasons why to

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:53.000 
begin to move into the reasons why to
change<00:04:49.949> area<00:04:50.430> I'm<00:04:50.669> being<00:04:51.150> directive<00:04:52.050> here<00:04:52.380> I'm

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:53.010 
change area I'm being directive here I'm

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:55.689 
change area I'm being directive here I'm
playing<00:04:53.550> down<00:04:53.940> one<00:04:54.240> side<00:04:54.570> and<00:04:54.960> I'm

00:04:55.689 --> 00:04:55.699 
playing down one side and I'm

00:04:55.699 --> 00:04:58.550 
playing down one side and I'm
elaborating<00:04:56.699> and<00:04:56.910> eliciting<00:04:57.660> on<00:04:57.960> the<00:04:58.350> other

00:04:58.550 --> 00:04:58.560 
elaborating and eliciting on the other

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:02.719 
elaborating and eliciting on the other
on<00:04:59.010> the<00:04:59.220> change<00:04:59.520> part<00:05:00.050> so<00:05:01.050> that<00:05:01.520> this<00:05:02.520> is

00:05:02.719 --> 00:05:02.729 
on the change part so that this is

00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:05.600 
on the change part so that this is
happening<00:05:02.940> simultaneously<00:05:03.650> I'm<00:05:04.650> following

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:05.610 
happening simultaneously I'm following

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:08.480 
happening simultaneously I'm following
the<00:05:05.789> client<00:05:06.330> but<00:05:06.990> simultaneously<00:05:07.470> I'm<00:05:08.190> also
