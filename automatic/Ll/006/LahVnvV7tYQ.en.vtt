00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:39.760 
the 3d popping out of it but this snake

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:41.850 
the 3d popping out of it but this snake
actually<00:01:40.180> does<00:01:40.780> come<00:01:41.020> out<00:01:41.170> of<00:01:41.290> the<00:01:41.380> screen<00:01:41.590> and

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:41.860 
actually does come out of the screen and

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:46.780 
another thing I mean I guess I could go

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:48.090 
another thing I mean I guess I could go
over<00:01:46.810> the<00:01:46.960> basic<00:01:47.230> specs<00:01:47.440> of<00:01:47.560> the<00:01:47.680> device<00:01:47.710> the

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.100 
over the basic specs of the device the

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.370 
over the basic specs of the device the
device<00:01:48.130> itself<00:01:48.730> is<00:01:49.060> running<00:01:49.240> the<00:01:49.930> CPU<00:01:50.290> is

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:50.380 
device itself is running the CPU is

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:53.070 
device itself is running the CPU is
running<00:01:50.410> a<00:01:50.680> 2.0<00:01:51.160> gigahertz<00:01:51.400> processor<00:01:52.080> that's

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:53.080 
running a 2.0 gigahertz processor that's

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:54.960 
running a 2.0 gigahertz processor that's
the<00:01:53.200> mtk<00:01:53.650> 8<00:01:53.890> core<00:01:54.160> so<00:01:54.310> you<00:01:54.370> have<00:01:54.490> eight<00:01:54.640> cores

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:54.970 
the mtk 8 core so you have eight cores

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:56.460 
the mtk 8 core so you have eight cores
to<00:01:55.210> you<00:01:55.300> know<00:01:55.420> for<00:01:55.600> all<00:01:55.690> your<00:01:55.840> gaming<00:01:56.020> me<00:01:56.290> eight

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:56.470 
to you know for all your gaming me eight

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:57.090 
to you know for all your gaming me eight
cores

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:57.100 
cores

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.310 
cores
eight<00:01:57.760> cores<00:01:58.120> that<00:01:58.240> is<00:01:58.540> bigger<00:01:58.840> than<00:01:59.050> anything

00:01:59.310 --> 00:01:59.320 
eight cores that is bigger than anything

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.300 
eight cores that is bigger than anything
else<00:01:59.740> that<00:02:00.130> I<00:02:00.220> know<00:02:00.280> of<00:02:00.670> as<00:02:00.790> far<00:02:01.030> as<00:02:01.180> phone<00:02:01.570> yeah

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
else that I know of as far as phone yeah

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.850 
else that I know of as far as phone yeah
you've<00:02:03.310> also<00:02:03.400> got<00:02:03.820> the<00:02:04.000> power<00:02:04.180> VR<00:02:04.840> series<00:02:05.320> to

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:05.860 
you've also got the power VR series to

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:08.639 
you've also got the power VR series to
600<00:02:06.280> megahertz<00:02:06.520> GPU<00:02:07.210> so<00:02:07.810> the<00:02:07.960> GPU<00:02:08.260> itself<00:02:08.560> is

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649 
600 megahertz GPU so the GPU itself is

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:10.260 
600 megahertz GPU so the GPU itself is
actually<00:02:08.980> great<00:02:09.280> you<00:02:09.429> know<00:02:09.550> you<00:02:09.610> can<00:02:09.880> push<00:02:10.090> all

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:10.270 
actually great you know you can push all

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:12.690 
actually great you know you can push all

now<00:03:57.270> obviously<00:03:58.270> I'm<00:03:58.510> not<00:03:58.660> viewing<00:03:58.990> it<00:03:59.080> in<00:03:59.140> 3d

00:03:59.370 --> 00:03:59.380 
now obviously I'm not viewing it in 3d

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:01.110 
now obviously I'm not viewing it in 3d
because<00:03:59.590> it's<00:03:59.830> not<00:03:59.920> tracking<00:04:00.160> my<00:04:00.310> face<00:04:00.670> right

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:01.120 
because it's not tracking my face right

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:02.940 
because it's not tracking my face right
so<00:04:01.390> when<00:04:01.630> it's<00:04:01.750> not<00:04:01.840> when<00:04:02.410> it's<00:04:02.560> not<00:04:02.680> tracking

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:02.950 
so when it's not when it's not tracking

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:04.320 
so when it's not when it's not tracking
somebody's<00:04:03.310> face<00:04:03.460> the<00:04:03.910> game<00:04:04.090> is<00:04:04.210> actually

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:04.330 
somebody's face the game is actually

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:07.200 
somebody's face the game is actually
gonna<00:04:04.600> run<00:04:04.750> a<00:04:04.780> 2d<00:04:05.110> right<00:04:05.610> this<00:04:06.610> device<00:04:06.880> itself

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:07.210 
gonna run a 2d right this device itself

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:09.300 
gonna run a 2d right this device itself
is<00:04:07.300> running<00:04:07.540> the<00:04:07.600> 4000<00:04:08.170> mAh<00:04:08.620> battery<00:04:09.070> which

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:09.310 
is running the 4000 mAh battery which

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:11.520 
is running the 4000 mAh battery which
means<00:04:09.760> it<00:04:09.910> gives<00:04:10.000> it<00:04:10.240> up<00:04:10.420> to<00:04:10.720> potentially<00:04:11.440> up

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:11.530 
means it gives it up to potentially up

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:13.860 
means it gives it up to potentially up
to<00:04:11.560> six<00:04:11.920> hours<00:04:12.010> of<00:04:12.280> non-stop<00:04:12.520> 3d<00:04:13.180> gaming<00:04:13.450> that

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:54.320 
attack and it's just that easy to do yes

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:56.170 
attack and it's just that easy to do yes
but<00:05:54.770> it's<00:05:54.889> also<00:05:55.070> still<00:05:55.460> using<00:05:55.820> this<00:05:55.910> as<00:05:56.060> an

00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:56.180 
but it's also still using this as an

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:57.820 
but it's also still using this as an
auto<00:05:56.300> attack<00:05:56.600> because<00:05:56.990> the<00:05:57.110> game<00:05:57.290> remembers

00:05:57.820 --> 00:05:57.830 
auto attack because the game remembers

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:00.100 
auto attack because the game remembers
that<00:05:58.790> this<00:05:58.940> was<00:05:59.120> the<00:05:59.210> original<00:05:59.330> control<00:05:59.960> for

the<00:06:00.169> auto<00:06:00.320> attack<00:06:00.590> control<00:06:01.100> is<00:06:01.190> cool

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:02.750
