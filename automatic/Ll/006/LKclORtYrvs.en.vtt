00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:02.010
 in the mornings there is always not enough time 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:04.460
 good summer everything is OK 

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:06.010
 for real 

00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:07.020
 it's nuts 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.770
 but in winter you have to kill precious 

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:11.340
 minutes to warm up the engine 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.630
 and maybe you shouldn't spend it 

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:15.990
 time the question is far from easy 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.119
 as it may seem 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:19.300
 There is a lot of opinion that some people think that 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.359
 better to warm up the engine on the go under 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.919
 the load as it is supposed to reach faster 

00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:25.579
 working temperature others vice versa 

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:28.390
 sure that when driving with a cold engine 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:30.419
 subsequently not avoid technical 

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:32.660
 problems but first things first before 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:34.610
 answer the respectable Hamlet question 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:37.170
 to be or not to be a problem in winter 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.120
 let's even see what it is 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.750
 is warming up the car 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:42.690
 this is a process during which all of it 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.450
 aggregates and fluids the same oils that fells and 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.660
 others brought to almost working 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:49.750
 temperatures that are necessary for 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:50.450
 normal functioning 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:53.420
 all knots of the machine but with russia 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.030
 the winter will be cold 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:57.190
 accordingly it is frozen Moscow 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:59.360
 his opinion has grown a lot because 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.720
 bonobo sauce came about if the driver is not 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:03.810
 make their way then there may be a number in 

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:05.430
 serviceability fail starts 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.740
 annoying maslov doesn't stand it 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.610
 loads start with climatic 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:11.060
 jealous of the opportunity 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:13.210
 full knots of that musabayeva difficulties 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:14.810
 because there were no problems later 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.080
 warranty repair and construction but 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.290
 technology development does not stop and what 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.390
 It seemed impossible to old owners 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.500
 cars became a reality but 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.039
 modern engines 

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:27.429
 who work on more advanced 

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:29.569
 oils especially now in new 

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:31.179
 There are many devices on machines 

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:33.299
 designed specifically to 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.519
 to speed up the warm-up 

00:01:35.519 --> 00:01:37.560
 motor to working condition 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.369
 so many of them are already in basic 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:41.200
 configuration set so 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.540
 called preheating 4 to the one that 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:45.930
 starts working from the first seconds after 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:46.559
 launch 

00:01:46.559 --> 00:01:48.099
 it got to the point that on some 

00:01:48.099 --> 00:01:50.609
 business cars and premium class far 

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:51.709
 do not always install 

00:01:51.709 --> 00:01:53.349
 temperature sensors 

00:01:53.349 --> 00:01:54.120
 interesting 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:56.170
 why the temperature sensor is lower 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:57.869
 because they basically need there 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.060
 so this and additional 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:00.990
 crash sensors not ready 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.720
 together with the work of the shelter 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.860
 during the break in the very first minutes of work 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.090
 cold engine enters the atmosphere 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:08.920
 most toxic 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:10.420
 exhaust so with 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:12.380
 ecological point of view warming 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:14.779
 car is bad for the environment 

00:02:14.779 --> 00:02:16.889
 don't waste time on this process kosovo 

00:02:16.889 --> 00:02:18.909
 thrifty car owners already by 

00:02:18.909 --> 00:02:20.749
 mercantile reasons do not want 

00:02:20.749 --> 00:02:23.329
 idle use of field kitchen fuel 

00:02:23.329 --> 00:02:25.370
 do not spill the car you decide 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:27.830
 on the one hand the car must throws 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:29.810
 scored as they say athletes twice 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:30.360
 greece 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.840
 but on the other hand everyone is always in a hurry 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.040
 so try to find him a golden one 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.650
 the middle
