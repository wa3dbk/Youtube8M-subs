00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 
have that third is because the D major

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:42.979 
have that third is because the D major
scale<00:02:40.140> has<00:02:40.769> an<00:02:40.980> F<00:02:41.190> sharp<00:02:41.430> ok<00:02:42.090> and<00:02:42.420> I<00:02:42.810> won't

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
my videos if you want to know why just

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.470 
my videos if you want to know why just
look<00:02:48.480> up<00:02:48.660> the<00:02:48.690> scale<00:02:49.019> video<00:02:49.350> ok<00:02:50.180> but<00:02:51.180> anyways

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
look up the scale video ok but anyways

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.270 
look up the scale video ok but anyways
the<00:02:51.720> D<00:02:51.870> chord<00:02:52.080> that's<00:02:52.319> in<00:02:52.620> court<00:02:52.890> and<00:02:53.010> that's<00:02:53.160> a

the D chord that's in court and that's a

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.820 
the D chord that's in court and that's a
fork<00:02:53.850> so<00:02:54.090> there's<00:02:54.269> three<00:02:54.590> chords<00:02:55.590> that<00:02:55.680> have<00:02:55.800> a

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.830 
fork so there's three chords that have a

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:57.559 
fork so there's three chords that have a
black<00:02:56.130> third<00:02:56.489> so<00:02:56.730> let's<00:02:56.940> review<00:02:57.269> there's

00:02:57.559 --> 00:02:57.569 
black third so let's review there's

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:59.570 
black third so let's review there's
three<00:02:57.780> that<00:02:57.959> are<00:02:57.989> all<00:02:58.170> white<00:02:58.410> see<00:02:58.769> Evan<00:02:59.310> Jake

reason there you have those black noses
because<00:03:13.920> in<00:03:14.220> the<00:03:14.280> key<00:03:14.430> of<00:03:14.459> D<00:03:14.670> flat<00:03:14.940> E<00:03:15.150> flat

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
because in the key of D flat E flat

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:17.600 
because in the key of D flat E flat
scale<00:03:15.870> goes<00:03:16.140> like<00:03:16.410> that<00:03:16.709> and<00:03:16.950> if<00:03:17.040> i<00:03:17.160> take<00:03:17.370> the

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:17.610 
scale goes like that and if i take the

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:19.670 
scale goes like that and if i take the
the<00:03:18.329> bottom<00:03:18.750> rung<00:03:18.900> of<00:03:18.989> the<00:03:19.049> ladder<00:03:19.110> the<00:03:19.470> third

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
the bottom rung of the ladder the third

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.199 
the bottom rung of the ladder the third
rung<00:03:19.890> letter<00:03:20.190> and<00:03:20.459> the<00:03:20.579> fifth<00:03:20.850> rung<00:03:21.090> of<00:03:21.180> the

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
rung letter and the fifth rung of the

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:24.560 
rung letter and the fifth rung of the
ladder<00:03:21.530> that's<00:03:22.530> the<00:03:22.739> D<00:03:22.950> chord<00:03:23.280> fork<00:03:23.640> d<00:03:24.360> flat

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:24.570 
ladder that's the D chord fork d flat

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:33.349 
ladder that's the D chord fork d flat
chord<00:03:27.320> I<00:03:29.720> can<00:03:30.720> add<00:03:31.790> extensions<00:03:32.790> to<00:03:33.000> that<00:03:33.150> but

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:33.359 
chord I can add extensions to that but

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:35.420 
chord I can add extensions to that but
it's<00:03:33.510> still<00:03:33.720> the<00:03:34.320> D<00:03:34.500> flat<00:03:34.709> chord<00:03:35.040> so<00:03:35.220> we<00:03:35.310> have

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
it's still the D flat chord so we have

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.580 
it's still the D flat chord so we have
three<00:03:35.640> that<00:03:35.790> are<00:03:35.820> all<00:03:36.000> blood<00:03:36.269> up<00:03:36.570> that<00:03:36.989> have<00:03:37.560> a
