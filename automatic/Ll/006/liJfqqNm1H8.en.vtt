 in tandil with raúl pérez roldán he 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.270
 taught how to train players or not 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:32.550
 I learned empirically only then I worked 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:35.610
 with bolettieri I worked with dennis vander 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:37.530
 Meer with people who knew how to train and know 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.840
 a lot of tennis there is no discussion about 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.110
 that I also learned from many people 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:45.479

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:22.569
 take 

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:25.060
 a more sterile pair like milk at 

00:05:22.569 --> 00:05:29.039
 morning coaches all the holy days 

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:31.350
 As my grandmother said, we are doing very well 

00:05:29.039 --> 00:05:34.080
 perfect 

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:36.780
 we combine the tall balls that we made 

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:40.530
 before with short balls and 

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:43.670
 we immediately teach the child girl 

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:43.670
 to go from behind 

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:50.280

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:57.150
 take air breathe deep let's go for 

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:58.680
 back and we do not vary the placement of the 

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:01.230
 ball and we also do it run in 

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:03.720
 way very well perfect two more by 

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:05.720
 please take this is a fighter is going to be 

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:09.020
 the color of a lot of claw 

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:11.060
 We would constantly take the location 

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:13.669
 of the ball coaches 

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:15.200
 we do not throw the ball always the same very 

00:06:13.669 --> 00:06:17.090
 well and another one for ahead and what 

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:19.960
 we surprise 

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:19.960
 we learn 

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:24.590
 excellent the last one does not fail me network 

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:28.840
 I know you're tired does not fail me 

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:30.850
 network are very well take water go very well 

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:33.250
 the two exercises that coaches saw 

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:35.110
 important things are not vital 

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:37.360
 I like to announce to the player 

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:39.580
 where will I throw the ball or what 

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:40.479
 height we also throw the ball low 

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:42.490
 okay 

00:06:40.479 --> 00:06:44.440
 how many balls how many repetitions 

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:46.540
 I'll tell you something in these months I 

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:48.220
 I spent watching videos learning to 

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:50.250
 very good video there are frightening videos 

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:53.889
 as all surely as some of mine 

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:55.600
 but there is something that I do not like about my 

00:06:53.889 --> 00:06:57.600
 colleagues when they give a lot of information 

00:06:55.600 --> 00:07:00.190
 but they do not tell us how much exactly 

00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:01.090
 how much for how many repetition how many 

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:03.550
 times a week 

00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:06.070
 how much or how much was it 

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:10.060
 good minutes this I repeat every day 

00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:13.300
 each exercise 57 minutes amount of 

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:16.720
 balls followed no more than 10 8 10 if not 

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:20.200
 the boy runs out too much coordination 

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:22.660
 true and lose exercise quality 

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:25.630
 let them rest for a minute minutes 

00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:28.449
 then return three series do what 

00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:31.889
 better 4 nothing else but this exercise is 

00:07:28.449 --> 00:07:31.889
 fundamental we will continue
