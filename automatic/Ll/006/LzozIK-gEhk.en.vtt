00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:07.200
 educational 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:10.490
 hello now we will explain the theme of the 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:14.230
 genes of evolution and behavior 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:16.970
 in behavioral genetics the geneticists 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:20.090
 behavioral studies have studied the issues 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:23.830
 interest to all psychologists 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:27.289
 perception learning and memory 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:29.359
 motivation and emotion 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:32.300
 personality and disorders 

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:35.059
 psychological but they do it from a 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:37.610
 genetic perspective your goal is 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:41.120
 identify which genes contribute to 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:43.820
 intelligence temperament 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:46.220
 talents and other features like that 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:48.170
 as genetic predispositions to 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:50.780
 psychological disorders and 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:53.869
 neurological of course the genes do not 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:56.930
 directly cause the behavior rather 

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:58.960
 affect the development and operation of 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:02.629
 nervous system and the endocrine system 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:04.670
 in animal driver genetics a lot of 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:06.590
 what we know about genetics 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:09.260
 behavioral comes from studies 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:11.810
 made with animals the mice are 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:14.030
 favorite subjects because they reproduce 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:16.620
 quickly and have patterns of 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:19.530
 relatively complex behavior 

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:22.260
 in the studies of family strains 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.630
 close as the brothers cross 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:27.330
 intensively throughout many 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.220
 generations to create strains of 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:32.550
 animals that are genetically 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:34.240
 similar to each other and different from each other 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:36.520
 strains 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:39.490
 when animals of different strains are 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:42.040
 created together in the same environment the 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:44.530
 differences between them reflect in large 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:47.710
 measured genetic differences in 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:49.659
 strains this method has shown that the 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:51.970
 inheritance influences performance in 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:53.500
 learning tasks as in the 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:55.840
 sense of smell and in the 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:58.149
 susceptibility to seizures 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:00.429
 talking about behavioral genetics 

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:02.679
 human for ethical reasons the 

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:04.840
 scientists can not conduct studies 

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:07.869
 of strains or selection with beings 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:10.299
 humans but there are different ways of 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:13.390
 indirectly study the techniques 

00:02:10.299 --> 00:02:15.610
 behavioral studies of families are 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:18.100
 based on the assumption that if the 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:20.230
 genes influence a trait the 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:22.420
 close family duty and should 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:25.030
 share it more often than 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:28.090
 distant relatives because the relatives 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:30.459
 nearby genes have more in common 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:33.250
 studies of twins have provided 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:35.890
 evidence of the heritability of a 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:38.050
 series of behaviors that range from 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:40.810
 verbal skills to the 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:44.230
 and life to peculiarities like strength 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:46.780
 from handshake to depression and the 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:49.800
 anxiety talking about genetics 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:52.450
 molecular until recently the geneticists 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:55.360
 behaviorists could only study the 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:57.360
 heritability indirectly but 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:00.130
 new techniques of molecular genetics 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:02.260
 even impossible to study and even 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:05.530
 change the genetic code directly 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:09.580
 human planet from the genome project 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:11.470
 human being undertaken in 1990 was to make a 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:14.980
 map of the 23 pairs of chromosomes 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:18.310
 humans and determine which genes influence 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:21.310
 on what characteristics in June of 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:23.850
 2000 ahead of schedule 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:26.760
 researchers announced the first map 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:29.410
 approximate of the entire human genome the 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:31.770
 researchers have already identified genes 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:34.620
 Individuals in specific chromosomes 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:37.960
 that are associated with diseases 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:39.640
 specific such as Alzheimer's also 

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:41.440
 have identified other chromosomes 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:44.590
 specific 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:48.280
 which are sites for the propensity to 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:51.660
 alcoholism schizophrenia suicide 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:55.050
 cognitive functioning the 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:57.580
 intelligence and even aging 

00:03:55.050 --> 00:04:00.160
 by using those markers 

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:03.700
 genetic researchers are expected 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:06.430
 not only prevent and reverse diseases 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:08.200
 genetic but also understand the role 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:12.370
 of inheritance in most of the 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:14.350
 complex behaviors in 1856 charles 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:17.620
 Darwin proposed the theory of selection 

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:19.930
 natural to explain the evolution the 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:22.420
 idea of ​​which groups of organisms change 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:24.520
 and adapt over time in 

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:26.740
 modern terms the theory of the 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:29.470
 natural selection affirms that the 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:32.110
 organisms better adapted to their environment 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:34.180
 they tend to survive by transmitting their 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:36.670
 genetic characteristics to 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:38.710
 following generations while the 

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:41.820
 organisms with less features 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:44.590
 adaptive tend to disappear now 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:46.300
 we will explain evolutionary psychology the 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:47.980
 evolutionary psychology analyzes the 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:50.890
 thoughts traits 

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:52.930
 and human behaviors by examining their value 

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:56.380
 adaptive from a perspective 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:58.800
 evolutionary has proved useful for 

00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:01.090
 explain many coincidences 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:03.070
 transcultural in human behavior 

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:05.710
 It has also proven to be useful for 

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:08.410
 explain the development of language 

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:11.889
 different sexual strategies in the 

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:14.830
 men and women and depression 

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:17.560
 however critics claim that the 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:19.930
 presence of a behavior in individuals 

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:22.090
 of many different cultures not 

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:24.879
 shows that it is predetermined in the 

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:27.090
 Some people fear that the 

00:05:24.879 --> 00:05:29.499
 research in evolutionary psychology 

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:32.409
 weaken the movement towards 

00:05:29.499 --> 00:05:35.199
 social equality in trying to justify 

00:05:32.409 --> 00:05:38.889
 the adaptive value of certain forms of 

00:05:35.199 --> 00:05:42.219
 social injustice others fear that it will 

00:05:38.889 --> 00:05:44.620
 feel to people that genetics equals 

00:05:42.219 --> 00:05:47.680
 to destination until here we have reached the 

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:49.719
 conclusion of the topic until soon 

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:52.240
 liked the video subscribe to the channel 

00:05:49.719 --> 00:05:55.050
 ducati also I do not recommend you see the 

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:55.050
 following videos
