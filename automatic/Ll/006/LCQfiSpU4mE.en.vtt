00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:15.330
 hello to all today for lexus I 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:19.500
 will make you the presentation and 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:22.650
 unpacking the bumper for nexus 4 so 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.000
 I'm getting yesterday so it's true he 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.230
 had a little bit of a delay also at 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.010
 level of delivery just like the 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:32.040
 nexus 4 who in stock slavery currently 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:33.840
 so the presentation of the package enough 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.780
 like this you have certainly seen 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:41.010
 also images of sweat on the internet 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:50.550
 so we will proceed to unpack the 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:57.899
 bumper so the package is everything 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:01:00.719
 simply is very simple here we have the 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:04.920
 even afraid so that is flexible enough 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:06.229
 so we find a little con tour 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.760
 made of metal 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:10.380
 so that makes an effect really very very 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:15.030
 class like these also saw at 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:16.799
 level 2 of the micro usb port and the other in 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.259
 matter it's like the plastics of the 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.729
 rubber for it to be we're in 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:25.729
 effect a little bit flexible so you can 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:28.229
 insert the nexus 4 otherwise just 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:31.290
 a little booklet there it is for the 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:36.299
 guarantee dotarem well anna particular 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:39.500
 for this package then we will see for 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:43.950
 setting up so it's simple 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:46.200
 I insert nexus 4 so this is it 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:49.189
 but thanks to rubber it gets very 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.329
 easily so there we see a little bit 

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:52.520
 the effect it can have on the 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:55.780
 behind 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:58.900
 I think that saw me well 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:00.520
 here on the front all this done 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:02.409
 really very pretty it's quite discreet 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.990
 it does not add to the phone 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:07.030
 it's true that I had one for the 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.289
 galaxy s iii I thought it's getting bigger 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.380
 it's really nice shot of 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:14.410
 phone live there I find it done 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:17.890
 rather made his classes with the little 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:20.800
 metal outline on the back I 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:22.600
 find that it's also unobtrusive by 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.190
 against at the level of protection but 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:26.739
 do not expect that the glass 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:28.420
 be protected I think that once laid 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:30.640
 on the table the glass is still in 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:33.010
 press contact that I advise you 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.900
 it is to put so a film that it is 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:36.250
 on the screen or on the back there 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:39.160
 currently I have a name that I know 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:41.380
 it would not be nice and movies that 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.790
 are really very discreet after at 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:46.660
 level of connectivity and ben they are 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:49.060
 of course available 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:53.739
 so there it was so reappear at 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:58.989
 sb and the microphone the touch the bar of 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:03:02.410
 volumes more and less apriso jack 3.5 mm 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:08.739
 and cause for the latest microphone channels 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:10.090
 on the high after for no the 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:15.370
 sheep it's really very responsive and 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:18.750
 no problem with a point of 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:20.890
 faster and separate volumes bar 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:24.489
 so for me it's a product really 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:26.049
 well done she does not knock and he is 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:28.750
 available so on fire he was 

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:30.299
 available on the playstation 2 9 euros 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:32.500
 99 

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:34.750
 so if you are looking for this type of 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:36.430
 protection it seems to me a good compromise 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:39.100
 after as I wanted to say everything to 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:41.190
 the time you have to know that the back does not 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:43.720
 will not necessarily protect from scratches 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:46.060
 but we will say that it is a product that 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:48.790
 is well finished that gives one that grows 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:50.140
 not the nexus cat and 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:52.719
 after I did not find any real 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:57.310
 real defect if not the protection of 

00:03:52.719 --> 00:03:59.500
 the back after to remove it's 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:01.329
 it's just like these 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:03.760
 gets off very easily and it starts 

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:05.620
 very easily so I think I did 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:06.849
 the trick of this bumper for the nexus cat 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:08.650
 and hoping they are very fast 

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:11.349
 available again on the board 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:16.209
 here I tell you next time for 

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:22.110
 a new video for galactus yes you 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:27.610
 tell you it will do but it goes in the 

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:32.039
 spice to think that's going well you've 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:32.039
 thought to be very pretty
