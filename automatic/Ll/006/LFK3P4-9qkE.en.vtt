this<00:02:10.670> is<00:02:10.970> another<00:02:11.180> way<00:02:11.390> to<00:02:11.810> create<00:02:12.170> a<00:02:12.290> gradient

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
this is another way to create a gradient

there<00:02:15.709> is<00:02:15.860> a<00:02:15.890> lot<00:02:16.190> more<00:02:16.400> power<00:02:16.640> to<00:02:17.000> this

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
there is a lot more power to this

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.380 
there is a lot more power to this
because<00:02:18.080> we<00:02:18.379> can<00:02:18.530> have<00:02:18.739> multiple<00:02:19.430> points<00:02:20.239> of
