00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
all the time you remember it's pretty

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.020 
all the time you remember it's pretty
easy<00:02:33.770> there's<00:02:34.770> only<00:02:34.860> one<00:02:34.980> little<00:02:35.819> thing<00:02:35.970> at

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
easy there's only one little thing at

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:37.309 
easy there's only one little thing at
the<00:02:36.120> end<00:02:36.150> you<00:02:36.330> might<00:02:36.480> forget<00:02:36.720> but<00:02:37.080> it's<00:02:37.200> not

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:37.319 
the end you might forget but it's not

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:39.770 
the end you might forget but it's not
too<00:02:37.470> hard<00:02:37.730> so<00:02:38.730> now<00:02:38.850> you've<00:02:39.000> got<00:02:39.150> your<00:02:39.180> redstone

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
too hard so now you've got your redstone

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:44.660 
too hard so now you've got your redstone
set<00:02:40.650> up<00:02:40.769> around<00:02:41.100> the<00:02:41.340> arm<00:02:42.620> Pistons<00:02:43.620> so<00:02:44.310> you<00:02:44.400> can

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
set up around the arm Pistons so you can

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.920 
set up around the arm Pistons so you can
see<00:02:44.820> that<00:02:45.680> the<00:02:46.680> patterns<00:02:47.340> in<00:02:47.880> there<00:02:48.180> so<00:02:48.750> if<00:02:48.840> you

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
see that the patterns in there so if you

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:50.090 
see that the patterns in there so if you
want<00:02:49.050> to<00:02:49.110> build<00:02:49.260> it<00:02:49.410> so<00:02:49.650> you<00:02:49.739> can<00:02:49.860> pause<00:02:50.070> it

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
want to build it so you can pause it

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:55.100 
want to build it so you can pause it
here<00:02:50.430> and<00:02:52.400> after<00:02:53.400> you've<00:02:53.489> done<00:02:53.580> that<00:02:54.110> you're

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
here and after you've done that you're

00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:01.690 
here and after you've done that you're
going<00:02:55.200> to<00:02:55.380> want<00:02:55.500> to<00:02:55.760> well<00:02:57.769> put<00:02:59.300> the<00:03:00.300> lever<00:03:00.900> here

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.700 
going to want to well put the lever here

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:04.460 
going to want to well put the lever here
it<00:03:02.700> all<00:03:02.820> comes<00:03:03.030> up<00:03:03.239> except<00:03:03.900> for<00:03:03.930> the<00:03:04.080> back<00:03:04.260> as

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
it all comes up except for the back as

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:06.620 
it all comes up except for the back as
you<00:03:04.530> can<00:03:04.650> see<00:03:04.920> sometimes<00:03:05.850> doesn't<00:03:06.180> work<00:03:06.209> but

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
you can see sometimes doesn't work but

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:09.770 
you can see sometimes doesn't work but
that's<00:03:06.840> not<00:03:07.260> to<00:03:07.860> worry<00:03:08.040> all<00:03:08.310> you<00:03:08.459> do<00:03:08.640> is<00:03:08.819> you

that's not to worry all you do is you
get<00:03:09.989> rid<00:03:10.110> of<00:03:10.170> this<00:03:10.290> redstone<00:03:10.590> here<00:03:11.660> pacer

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
get rid of this redstone here pacer

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:15.680 
get rid of this redstone here pacer
appear<00:03:12.900> and<00:03:13.220> it<00:03:14.220> all<00:03:14.340> comes<00:03:14.489> up<00:03:14.670> see<00:03:15.480> how<00:03:15.630> the

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
appear and it all comes up see how the

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:18.229 
appear and it all comes up see how the
dr<00:03:16.590> buttons<00:03:17.100> of<00:03:17.190> the<00:03:17.280> repeater<00:03:17.640> are<00:03:17.850> facing

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 
dr buttons of the repeater are facing

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:20.330 
dr buttons of the repeater are facing
the<00:03:18.390> dirt<00:03:18.750> there<00:03:19.019> you're<00:03:19.829> going<00:03:19.950> to<00:03:20.070> want<00:03:20.190> to

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
the dirt there you're going to want to

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.210 
the dirt there you're going to want to
put<00:03:20.549> another<00:03:20.850> repeater<00:03:21.350> so<00:03:22.350> it's<00:03:22.470> not<00:03:22.709> facing

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
put another repeater so it's not facing

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.759 
put another repeater so it's not facing
it's<00:03:23.370> facing<00:03:23.670> the<00:03:23.700> opposite<00:03:24.180> way<00:03:24.530> as<00:03:25.530> you<00:03:25.680> can

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:25.769 
it's facing the opposite way as you can

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:29.150 
it's facing the opposite way as you can
see<00:03:26.150> so<00:03:27.150> just<00:03:27.350> keep<00:03:28.350> that<00:03:28.410> in<00:03:28.560> your<00:03:28.680> head<00:03:28.860> so

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
see so just keep that in your head so

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.670 
see so just keep that in your head so
you<00:03:29.370> can<00:03:29.549> make<00:03:29.640> it<00:03:29.700> so<00:03:29.850> everyone<00:03:30.120> and<00:03:30.680> then

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
you can make it so everyone and then

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:36.640 
you can make it so everyone and then
when<00:03:31.890> you<00:03:32.010> flick<00:03:32.220> switch<00:03:32.549> it<00:03:34.430> all<00:03:35.430> comes<00:03:35.640> up

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:36.650 
when you flick switch it all comes up

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:42.610 
when you flick switch it all comes up
alright<00:03:37.650> so<00:03:38.160> now<00:03:38.840> obviously<00:03:39.840> put<00:03:40.049> the<00:03:40.170> arm

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:42.620 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:45.380 

bookshelf<00:03:43.620> cases<00:03:44.250> whatever<00:03:44.549> they<00:03:44.640> are<00:03:44.670> on<00:03:45.030> the

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.390 
bookshelf cases whatever they are on the

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:52.180 
bookshelf cases whatever they are on the
UM<00:03:45.829> distance<00:03:49.760> then<00:03:50.760> when<00:03:51.000> you<00:03:51.480> click<00:03:51.840> the

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:52.190 
UM distance then when you click the

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:56.060 
UM distance then when you click the
button<00:03:53.190> or<00:03:53.370> lever<00:03:54.049> it<00:03:55.049> all<00:03:55.200> works<00:03:55.620> out<00:03:55.859> fine

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:56.070 
button or lever it all works out fine

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:59.300 
button or lever it all works out fine
and<00:03:56.370> to<00:03:57.269> cover<00:03:57.480> it<00:03:57.660> up<00:03:57.750> this<00:03:58.019> is<00:03:58.170> the<00:03:58.350> harder

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
and to cover it up this is the harder

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:02.539 
and to cover it up this is the harder
bit<00:03:59.459> that<00:03:59.640> you<00:03:59.670> might<00:03:59.970> forget<00:04:01.040> what<00:04:02.040> to<00:04:02.430> get

00:04:02.539 --> 00:04:02.549 
bit that you might forget what to get

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:04.810 
bit that you might forget what to get
them<00:04:02.700> so<00:04:03.120> you<00:04:03.180> don't<00:04:03.510> need<00:04:03.600> the<00:04:03.750> thing<00:04:04.140> there

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:04.820 
them so you don't need the thing there

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:07.930 
them so you don't need the thing there
to<00:04:05.820> get<00:04:05.910> the<00:04:06.060> red<00:04:06.239> stone<00:04:06.450> to<00:04:06.720> a<00:04:06.750> pressure<00:04:07.019> plate

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:07.940 
to get the red stone to a pressure plate

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:09.650 
to get the red stone to a pressure plate
because<00:04:08.940> you're<00:04:09.090> probably<00:04:09.239> gonna<00:04:09.420> want<00:04:09.480> to

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:09.660 
because you're probably gonna want to

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:11.000 
because you're probably gonna want to
press<00:04:09.840> a<00:04:09.870> fresher<00:04:10.380> play<00:04:10.620> it's<00:04:10.769> probably

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.010 
press a fresher play it's probably

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:14.539 
press a fresher play it's probably
better<00:04:11.190> to<00:04:12.200> cover<00:04:13.200> up<00:04:13.350> the<00:04:13.440> redstone<00:04:13.829> that's

00:04:14.539 --> 00:04:14.549 
better to cover up the redstone that's

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:15.800 
better to cover up the redstone that's
all<00:04:14.669> you<00:04:14.760> have<00:04:14.850> to<00:04:14.940> do<00:04:15.030> it's<00:04:15.299> like<00:04:15.419> a<00:04:15.449> um

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810 
all you have to do it's like a um

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:18.170 
all you have to do it's like a um
because<00:04:16.380> I<00:04:16.530> got<00:04:16.680> confused<00:04:17.100> the<00:04:17.519> redstone<00:04:17.940> just

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180 
because I got confused the redstone just

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:20.060 
because I got confused the redstone just
goes<00:04:18.299> into<00:04:18.570> this<00:04:18.690> bottom<00:04:19.260> block<00:04:19.440> here

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070 
goes into this bottom block here

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:22.690 
goes into this bottom block here
and<00:04:20.160> then<00:04:20.940> you<00:04:21.060> put<00:04:21.270> that<00:04:21.540> book<00:04:21.810> over<00:04:21.990> it<00:04:22.320> and

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:22.700 
and then you put that book over it and

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:26.090 
and then you put that book over it and
so<00:04:23.700> when<00:04:23.910> you<00:04:24.030> get<00:04:24.180> the<00:04:24.420> you<00:04:24.890> can<00:04:25.890> use<00:04:26.070> a

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:26.100 
so when you get the you can use a

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:27.980 
so when you get the you can use a
pressure<00:04:26.310> plate<00:04:26.520> blockages<00:04:27.030> in<00:04:27.090> the<00:04:27.210> level

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:27.990 
pressure plate blockages in the level

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:31.160 
pressure plate blockages in the level
for<00:04:28.170> the<00:04:28.260> show<00:04:28.910> so<00:04:29.910> yeah<00:04:30.240> it<00:04:30.660> works<00:04:30.900> I<00:04:31.020> like

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:31.170 
for the show so yeah it works I like

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:32.630 
for the show so yeah it works I like
that<00:04:31.290> that's<00:04:31.620> just<00:04:31.740> the<00:04:31.860> harder<00:04:32.190> part<00:04:32.430> and

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:32.640 
that that's just the harder part and

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:35.420 
that that's just the harder part and
then<00:04:33.510> to<00:04:33.690> cover<00:04:33.900> the<00:04:34.050> whole<00:04:34.200> thing<00:04:34.230> up<00:04:34.500> pretty

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:35.430 
then to cover the whole thing up pretty

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:47.510 
then to cover the whole thing up pretty
easy<00:04:42.380> not<00:04:43.380> hard<00:04:43.590> at<00:04:43.710> all<00:04:46.190> pretty<00:04:47.190> much<00:04:47.220> got

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:47.520 
easy not hard at all pretty much got

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:54.890 
easy not hard at all pretty much got
your<00:04:47.990> hidden<00:04:48.990> in<00:04:49.790> xem<00:04:50.790> table<00:04:53.900> cool

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:54.900 
your hidden in xem table cool

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:56.780
