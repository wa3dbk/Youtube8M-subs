00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.009
 Hello friends with you again for play 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:07.500
 I quickly dashed off a theory that 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:10.050
 I hope you are interested see 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.750
 many fnaf fans have already heard that 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:15.330
 brother of the child affected by the bite is 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.940
 phone guy from the first fnafa so 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.760
 that's who is to blame for this incident 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.769
 brother or fredber but of course brother but 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.140
 as I said earlier in my other 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:27.480
 theories maybe pizzerias thought differently 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.939
 her bite was blamed fredber a 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:33.000
 fredber is just the same golden freddie 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:35.100
 This is clear from the mini-game fnaf 3 experience 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.680
 01 but here is an event in this mini game 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.870
 happens before that one happened 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.120
 the most bite so here let's think where 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.789
 in the first fnaf may be golden 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.649
 Freddie and if he is there at all well let's start with 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.750
 the fact that we remember what we said 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:51.360
 phone guy on the fifth night before 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:54.629
 the way he was killed animatronics and said 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.699
 he is the next thing do me a favor 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:00.449
 can you check dance costumes 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:02.550
 Bolin workshop I try to hold out 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:06.090
 until something can check everything 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:08.760
 will not be so bad I've always been 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:12.560
 I wonder what these empty heads are 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.560
 you know oh no 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:20.660
 so here if the phone guy is 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:23.270
 those adolescents whose fault 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:25.400
 hurt the child then probably fredber 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:27.500
 I mean, golden Freddy is what he 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.810
 revenge and if so it becomes 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.250
 I understand why the phone guy asks 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:33.950
 check us out one of the costumes 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:36.470
 workshop that is, he knows what exactly 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:38.750
 the workshop is golden freddy so 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:40.729
 he doesn't want to date him because 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:42.979
 Fredbier has personal accounts with him 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:45.080
 also the phone guy said he could 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:46.070
 everything will not be so bad i mean he 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.200
 would rather be 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:50.210
 given to the mercy of animatronic but 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.960
 only not fredberu i mean gold 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:53.720
 Freddie 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:56.060
 well and in the end he said you know oh no 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:58.580
 that probably said that all the same 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:01.340
 telephone guy met with someone 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:03.229
 I didn't want to meet in gold 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.180
 Well, on this all put big 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:08.860
