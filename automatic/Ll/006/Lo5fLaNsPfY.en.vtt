00:00:14.499 --> 00:00:22.070
 I want to tell you about one of 

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:24.620
 procedures that throughout the course I 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:25.130
 I will have to go to the sanatorium red 

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:27.830
 lake 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:31.220
 This procedure is called liver type 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:34.750
 which helps to improve outflow 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:34.750
 gall bladder 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:42.940
 your reason goes in two stages this in 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:46.660
 first of all we drink means 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:49.390
 the solution defined in this case is 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:54.230
 decoction of corn silk 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:56.450
 here then comfortable lie down on the bed 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:58.309
 right side of the liver and 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:04.190
 now tell you what we will do 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:08.830
 we do for half an hour su-jok 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:11.990
 with su jok therapy stimulates 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:16.820
 our gall bladder ie women 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:19.010
 doing a massage on the right hand here 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:22.520
 thumb to center 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:25.460
 within an hour of here 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:28.190
 from thumb to center man 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:30.860
 doing the same massage on the left hand but 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:34.170
 Only about the little finger and that is the one 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:38.070
 little finger not big finger 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:41.460
 so we also make the diaphragmatic 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:45.780
 breathing and breathing exercises ie 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:49.080
 we are puffing up a big tummy through the nose and 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:51.420
 exhale the muscles just as well with us 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:54.899
 must be strained when exhaling that is 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.880
 when we exhale with our mouth we stretch 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:02:00.869
 tummy well that the muscles were tense 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:03.990
 have a breath in belly fill out exhale mouth and 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:06.090
 muscle strain that is it turn

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.390
 5 replies 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:29.560

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.670
 again 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:58.000
 what I want to say rosehip syrup 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:03:02.140

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:11.270
 impressions and introduce you to new 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:18.820
 not reached means beyond those procedures 

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:25.940
 which yesterday is detoxification oil

 therapist mud cure galokamera 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:34.160
 Today I have added a lot 

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:35.510
 interesting cognitive procedure 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:41.590
 which I advised 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:46.310
 and rifles it take impedance miter 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:46.970
 or more simply the composition research 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:50.990
 bodies 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:57.640
 This study allows you to find out. 

00:03:50.990 --> 00:04:00.560
 the ratio of fat and muscle and in our body 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:04.120
 lets you know what is going on 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:07.580
 obesity weight gain and allows 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:09.770
 more specifically see which 

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:12.170
 problem areas and what tree 

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:14.810
 to pay attention with this 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:16.540
 correct nutrition means 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:19.930
 something outside 

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:22.760
 this study after means 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:25.760
 research we talked universes 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:29.060
 bathroom and how she told me that to me 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:30.880
 need a low calorie diet reduction 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:33.290
 calorie intake 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:38.420
 balanced nutrition is right 

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:40.250
 protein fat ratio and restriction 

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:43.550
 salts in order to excess liquid 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:46.250
 exiting the body sugar restrictions 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:50.480
 nothing taking fast carbs then 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:51.110
 eat this nightly sugar sweet 

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:54.980
 fruits 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:58.610
 water and in order to speed up the main 

00:04:54.980 --> 00:05:00.890
 muscle exchange and tidy up 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:04.760
 that is, you have more 

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:07.580
 muscle mass increase that's why 

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:11.320
 on this we will work i hope that 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:14.690
 I will repeat a similar 

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:17.600
 examination after two months in order 

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:21.230
 to compare the results in order 

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:22.610
 see victory over your body 

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:25.389
 i.e. these numbers 

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:29.490
 I leave myself so I hope that everything 

00:05:25.389 --> 00:05:33.000
 somehow different half 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:35.419
 on terrible procedure with moss and there and on 

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:38.639
 thorin hawaii bowel cleansing 

00:05:35.419 --> 00:05:40.949
 talk about me I will not we without 

00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:43.080
 This procedure is unfortunately not enough 

00:05:40.949 --> 00:05:44.789
 because we all know that in order 

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:47.220
 to cleanse the body and first 

00:05:44.789 --> 00:05:52.310
 all need to clean our intestines 

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:55.199
 so I cried suffer but endure not 

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:58.050
 now probably the most pleasant thing is not 

00:05:55.199 --> 00:06:00.380
 I love to eat this for second breakfast 

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:06.080
 we had today 

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:09.680
 fruit and vegetable casserole of carrots with 

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:11.819
 the apple is very tasty it was very 

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:13.740
 pleasant aftertaste in principle 

00:06:11.819 --> 00:06:16.110
 sugar does not even require for 

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:18.030
 because the apple gives a certain 

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:21.569
 sour as you know carrots and she 

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:25.319
 in itself gives sweetness and of course without 

00:06:21.569 --> 00:06:28.669
 on delicious cheese with a leaf of lettuce from 

00:06:25.319 --> 00:06:33.300
 whom I twisted a wonderful shower 

00:06:28.669 --> 00:06:36.899
 here but not this dish to my taste 

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:39.059
 ranked first today attracted 

00:06:36.899 --> 00:06:42.499
 my attention is near 

00:06:39.059 --> 00:06:47.279
 we have fishballs for dinner 

00:06:42.499 --> 00:06:51.649
 stuffed with olives sweat and salad 

00:06:47.279 --> 00:06:56.879
 fresh vegetables and 

00:06:51.649 --> 00:06:59.430
 so we had vegetable sauce to which 

00:06:56.879 --> 00:07:04.740
 we fueled all this fish all get 

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:08.270
 delicious means now after dinner I'll go 

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:12.180
 take a walk and then to him 

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:14.610
 the last procedure before bed, I probably 

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:18.080
 say goodbye to you today we will meet 

00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:18.080
