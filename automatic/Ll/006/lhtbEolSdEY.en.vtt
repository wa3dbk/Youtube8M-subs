00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:34.210 
got an airborne trooper to blink clones

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:39.950 
got an airborne trooper to blink clones
and<00:01:34.740> to<00:01:35.740> Imperial<00:01:36.429> Scouts<00:01:36.759> I<00:01:37.090> did<00:01:37.960> not<00:01:38.140> include

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
and to Imperial Scouts I did not include

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.309 
and to Imperial Scouts I did not include
those<00:01:40.960> people<00:01:41.679> because<00:01:42.280> I<00:01:43.229> didn't<00:01:44.229> really

00:01:44.309 --> 00:01:44.319 
those people because I didn't really

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:46.230 
those people because I didn't really
think<00:01:44.590> they<00:01:44.800> should<00:01:44.979> be<00:01:45.100> included<00:01:45.610> in<00:01:45.789> a<00:01:45.909> clone

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:46.240 
think they should be included in a clone

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.380 
think they should be included in a clone
