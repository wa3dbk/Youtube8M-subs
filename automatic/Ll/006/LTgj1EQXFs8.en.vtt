Hey Everybody. This video is specifically
for those that have been asking to see the

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:20.460
tractor in action. Here's what we're going
to do today, we've had a bit of a cold front

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.600
move through. Autumn is trying to make her
presence felt and it's been very pleasant

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:31.890
day. Nice drizzle, a little bit of heavy rain
now and then bringing in the cooler weather,

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:37.070
but it's let up with just enough light left
in the day for us to try to get a bit of work

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:43.220
done on a Saturday afternoon.
So, this is the normal walk path that goes

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:49.420
to the back part of our property and it's
just not big enough for me to get the tractor

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:55.030
down and I'm not quite ready yet to pull up
this electric fencing on the left, so what

00:00:55.030 --> 00:01:02.030
we're going to do instead is use the tractor
and bush hog and come through this place.

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:08.930
Now a word for my permaculture minded friends,
I've already taken a good steady look at this

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:14.150
area, and while I'm confident that I don't
know every plant that's growing in here, I'm

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:18.900
confident enough to say that if it seems to
be beneficial, if we've been able to identify

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:25.510
it as beneficial, such as this wild trailing
bean over here, that some seeds have been

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:30.740
collected and I've saved them to plant them
where we would like them, or I know that the

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:36.200
plant is growing prolifically somewhere else
on the property. So while I'm about to completely

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:42.310
demolish this area, I don't believe I'm completely
removing anything from my property by doing

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:45.290
this. Of course I understand that it's still
growing anyway.

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:50.810
So I'm gonna set the tripod up and I'm gonna
bring the tractor over and just let you guys

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.090
see what this monstrosity can do.

00:01:53.090 --> 00:02:00.000
