00:00:00.449 --> 00:00:02.650
 this is an electric motor 

00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:04.150
 that is unarmed 

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:07.020
 with all its pieces 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.020
 and at the same time it is a generator 

00:00:11.569 --> 00:00:14.569
 here is this side we have a coil 

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:18.129
 a coil that is connected with led focus 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.480
 this move makes the nation 

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:25.929
 to have current 

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:28.929
 conforming to magnetism 

00:00:30.319 --> 00:00:33.319
 which is generated here with electric current 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:36.980
 the electric current 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.550
 these two cartels we have a little 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.020
 that st switch 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:47.700
 and so let the current pass 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.980
 towards the coals and we have the coals 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:53.360
 there you can see 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.030
 the coals 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:58.930
 and when passing the alternating current is generated 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:01.440
 movement 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.730
 manuel pichel 

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:06.080
 there is a 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:07.920
 there this 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.690
 magnetism 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:11.580
 here in the 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.400
 ninel gotor 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.400
 and here below we have a magnet 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.510
 estimate 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:23.510
 comes a polarity 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.040
 and something around here 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.700
 another polarity 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:29.670
 that's why it turns 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.670
 let's see it in action 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:37.130
 by 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:49.920
 in the general the general 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.920
 the rival area 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:05.810
 also interested 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:08.840
 at the same time two subjects will let pass current 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:13.199
 to this little generator 

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:15.019
 that's why it turns off a little 

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:16.749
 and when throwing 

00:02:16.749 --> 00:02:17.959
 how is there a 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:20.329
 there this 

00:02:20.329 --> 00:02:23.329
 magnetism this same magnetism 

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:26.849
 that generates current 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:29.849
 and go to little 

00:02:31.899 --> 00:02:32.779
 we have electricity
