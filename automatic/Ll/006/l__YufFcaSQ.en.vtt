guys<00:01:41.610> are<00:01:42.180> about<00:01:42.659> the<00:01:43.020> the<00:01:43.619> wiring<00:01:44.040> of<00:01:44.220> the

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
guys are about the the wiring of the

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:48.649 
guys are about the the wiring of the
game<00:01:44.759> itself<00:01:45.320> the<00:01:46.320> controls<00:01:46.770> and<00:01:47.130> the<00:01:48.090> video

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
game itself the controls and the video

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.590 
game itself the controls and the video
for<00:01:49.439> this<00:01:49.619> although<00:01:50.549> if<00:01:50.729> you<00:01:50.909> take<00:01:51.270> a<00:01:51.299> look<00:01:51.390> at

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
for this although if you take a look at

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.929 
for this although if you take a look at
this<00:01:51.750> edge<00:01:52.560> connector<00:01:53.130> here<00:01:53.280> this<00:01:53.460> is<00:01:53.579> a<00:01:53.610> jam<00:01:53.909> a

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
this edge connector here this is a jam a

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:57.319 
this edge connector here this is a jam a
compatible<00:01:54.680> connector<00:01:55.680> it<00:01:56.219> doesn't<00:01:56.670> use<00:01:56.969> all

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
compatible connector it doesn't use all

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:00.920 
compatible connector it doesn't use all
but<00:01:57.659> maybe<00:01:58.020> 10<00:01:58.590> or<00:01:58.619> 11<00:01:59.340> of<00:01:59.549> the<00:01:59.820> the<00:02:00.450> pins<00:02:00.689> on

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
but maybe 10 or 11 of the the pins on

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.380 
but maybe 10 or 11 of the the pins on
this<00:02:01.170> it<00:02:01.439> doesn't<00:02:01.799> use<00:02:01.950> all<00:02:02.159> of<00:02:02.340> them<00:02:02.490> and<00:02:02.700> if

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
this it doesn't use all of them and if

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.179 
this it doesn't use all of them and if
you<00:02:03.540> have<00:02:03.689> everything<00:02:03.990> connected<00:02:04.560> to<00:02:04.710> this<00:02:04.860> at

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
you have everything connected to this at

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.700 
you have everything connected to this at
one<00:02:05.490> time<00:02:05.790> you<00:02:06.659> can<00:02:06.810> probably<00:02:07.020> cause<00:02:07.320> more

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
one time you can probably cause more

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.290 
one time you can probably cause more
trouble<00:02:07.890> for<00:02:08.250> yourself<00:02:08.399> than<00:02:08.819> what's<00:02:09.000> needed

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
trouble for yourself than what's needed

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.440 
trouble for yourself than what's needed
what<00:02:09.959> I<00:02:09.989> mean<00:02:10.170> by<00:02:10.229> that<00:02:10.530> is<00:02:10.920> the<00:02:11.819> board<00:02:12.330> itself

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
what I mean by that is the board itself

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.640 
what I mean by that is the board itself
only<00:02:13.080> need

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
it's the negatives on both ends needs

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.479 
it's the negatives on both ends needs
the<00:02:16.829> plus<00:02:17.189> five<00:02:17.489> needs<00:02:18.239> plus<00:02:18.599> 12<00:02:19.019> you<00:02:19.650> need<00:02:19.860> red

to<00:03:37.019> make<00:03:37.169> this<00:03:37.379> so<00:03:37.620> that<00:03:37.769> you<00:03:37.919> can<00:03:38.190> use<00:03:39.090> a

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
to make this so that you can use a

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.809 
to make this so that you can use a
regular<00:03:39.569> JAMA<00:03:40.019> harness<00:03:40.680> you<00:03:41.400> can<00:03:41.549> do<00:03:41.639> one<00:03:41.790> of

00:03:41.809 --> 00:03:41.819 
regular JAMA harness you can do one of

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:43.580 
regular JAMA harness you can do one of
two<00:03:41.940> things<00:03:42.090> you<00:03:42.930> can<00:03:43.079> either<00:03:43.199> make<00:03:43.440> an

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
two things you can either make an

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.890 
two things you can either make an
adapter<00:03:44.069> for<00:03:44.250> this<00:03:44.430> and<00:03:44.729> have<00:03:45.419> one<00:03:45.720> that

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
adapter for this and have one that

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:47.719 
adapter for this and have one that
slides<00:03:46.139> on<00:03:46.440> here<00:03:46.829> and<00:03:46.979> then<00:03:47.040> has<00:03:47.310> different

00:03:47.719 --> 00:03:47.729 
slides on here and then has different

00:03:47.729 --> 00:03:49.789 
slides on here and then has different
wires<00:03:47.879> that<00:03:48.180> are<00:03:48.239> attached<00:03:49.139> to<00:03:49.290> a<00:03:49.349> fingerboard

00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:49.799 
wires that are attached to a fingerboard

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:52.009 
wires that are attached to a fingerboard
or<00:03:50.459> you<00:03:50.549> can<00:03:50.669> do<00:03:50.760> something<00:03:51.030> what<00:03:51.299> I<00:03:51.329> did<00:03:51.629> here

00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:52.019 
or you can do something what I did here

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:54.649 
or you can do something what I did here
I<00:03:52.169> wound<00:03:53.010> up<00:03:53.099> soldering<00:03:53.519> the<00:03:53.669> wires<00:03:54.269> that<00:03:54.389> I

00:03:54.649 --> 00:03:54.659 
I wound up soldering the wires that I

00:03:54.659 --> 00:03:58.369 
I wound up soldering the wires that I
needed<00:03:54.900> this<00:03:55.769> is<00:03:56.040> the<00:03:56.970> coin<00:03:57.629> in<00:03:57.840> this<00:03:58.199> is

00:03:58.369 --> 00:03:58.379 
needed this is the coin in this is

00:03:58.379 --> 00:04:00.500 
needed this is the coin in this is
player<00:03:58.590> 1<00:03:58.620> start<00:03:59.190> on<00:03:59.370> the<00:03:59.729> bottom<00:04:00.120> as<00:04:00.269> player

player 1 start on the bottom as player
to<00:04:00.840> start<00:04:01.229> this<00:04:02.099> is<00:04:02.310> player<00:04:02.549> 1<00:04:02.579> but<00:04:03.000> one<00:04:03.269> and<00:04:03.510> on

00:04:03.589 --> 00:04:03.599 
to start this is player 1 but one and on

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:06.229 
to start this is player 1 but one and on
the<00:04:03.750> bottom<00:04:03.949> if<00:04:04.949> you<00:04:05.159> can<00:04:05.310> see<00:04:05.489> down<00:04:05.669> here<00:04:05.970> I

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:06.239 
the bottom if you can see down here I

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:09.909 
the bottom if you can see down here I
don't<00:04:06.780> know<00:04:06.870> if<00:04:06.989> you<00:04:07.079> can<00:04:07.229> see<00:04:07.440> is<00:04:08.659> player<00:04:09.659> 1

00:04:09.909 --> 00:04:09.919 
don't know if you can see is player 1

00:04:09.919 --> 00:04:12.860 
don't know if you can see is player 1
player<00:04:10.919> 2<00:04:10.949> button<00:04:11.519> one<00:04:11.699> that's<00:04:12.150> all<00:04:12.359> I<00:04:12.389> did<00:04:12.720> is

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:12.870 
player 2 button one that's all I did is

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:14.479 
player 2 button one that's all I did is
I<00:04:12.989> just<00:04:13.049> soldered<00:04:13.470> it<00:04:13.620> directly<00:04:13.949> to<00:04:14.129> the<00:04:14.250> board

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:14.489 
I just soldered it directly to the board

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:16.310 
I just soldered it directly to the board
the<00:04:15.060> reason<00:04:15.389> for<00:04:15.540> that<00:04:15.569> is<00:04:15.870> because<00:04:15.900> they

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 
the reason for that is because they

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:17.839 
the reason for that is because they
didn't<00:04:16.560> have<00:04:16.590> a<00:04:16.709> fingerboard<00:04:17.070> here<00:04:17.579> an<00:04:17.699> extra

00:04:17.839 --> 00:04:17.849 
didn't have a fingerboard here an extra

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:20.509 
didn't have a fingerboard here an extra
finger<00:04:18.239> board<00:04:18.570> and<00:04:18.900> as<00:04:19.650> long<00:04:20.039> as<00:04:20.220> you<00:04:20.340> have

finger board and as long as you have
these<00:04:20.699> pins<00:04:21.630> connected<00:04:22.169> here<00:04:22.409> you<00:04:22.800> really

00:04:23.029 --> 00:04:23.039 
these pins connected here you really

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:24.730 
these pins connected here you really
don't<00:04:23.219> have<00:04:23.310> to<00:04:23.400> worry<00:04:23.639> about<00:04:23.760> anything<00:04:24.120> else

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:24.740

the way this will work is pin one is

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:18.760 
the way this will work is pin one is
going<00:05:15.830> to<00:05:15.889> be<00:05:16.039> your<00:05:16.130> plus<00:05:16.400> 5<00:05:16.729> volts<00:05:17.240> for<00:05:17.770> player

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:18.770 
going to be your plus 5 volts for player

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:22.990 
going to be your plus 5 volts for player
1<00:05:19.130> and<00:05:19.400> this<00:05:20.270> is<00:05:20.330> going<00:05:20.690> to<00:05:20.870> be<00:05:21.020> your<00:05:21.620> x<00:05:22.400> and<00:05:22.970> y
