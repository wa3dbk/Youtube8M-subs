collection for this next part excuse me
a<00:01:02.119> mask<00:01:02.510> as<00:01:03.289> the<00:01:03.619> birch<00:01:03.860> dust<00:01:04.869> is<00:01:05.869> a<00:01:06.289> little

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:06.590 
a mask as the birch dust is a little

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:10.149 
a mask as the birch dust is a little
strong<00:01:07.810> so<00:01:08.810> we're<00:01:09.080> starting<00:01:09.229> with<00:01:09.409> 220<00:01:10.130> grit

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:10.159 
strong so we're starting with 220 grit

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:12.130 
strong so we're starting with 220 grit
on<00:01:10.490> the<00:01:10.610> siding<00:01:10.970> and<00:01:11.000> that's<00:01:11.210> all<00:01:11.360> we<00:01:11.509> need<00:01:11.780> to

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:12.140 
on the siding and that's all we need to

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:17.020 
on the siding and that's all we need to
do<00:01:12.759> since<00:01:13.759> it's<00:01:13.970> smoother<00:01:14.390> and<00:01:15.520> it's<00:01:16.520> by<00:01:16.729> hand

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:17.030 
do since it's smoother and it's by hand

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:19.990 
do since it's smoother and it's by hand
so<00:01:17.509> work<00:01:17.750> your<00:01:17.780> way<00:01:17.990> around<00:01:18.110> the<00:01:18.380> siding<00:01:19.000> you

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.000 
so work your way around the siding you

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.200 
so work your way around the siding you
can<00:01:20.330> I<00:01:20.929> usually<00:01:21.619> choose<00:01:21.860> to<00:01:22.190> maintain<00:01:22.819> the

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:23.210 
can I usually choose to maintain the

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:25.590 
can I usually choose to maintain the
burned<00:01:23.659> edges<00:01:24.110> of<00:01:24.289> the<00:01:24.409> top<00:01:24.619> and<00:01:24.830> the<00:01:24.890> back

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:25.600 
burned edges of the top and the back

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.149 
burned edges of the top and the back
that<00:01:26.600> you<00:01:26.810> can<00:01:26.840> also<00:01:27.110> satin<00:01:27.679> them<00:01:27.770> completely

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:28.159 
that you can also satin them completely

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:30.820 
that you can also satin them completely
away<00:01:28.520> but<00:01:29.390> it<00:01:29.509> does<00:01:29.630> look<00:01:29.810> funny<00:01:30.140> if<00:01:30.470> they're

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:30.830 
away but it does look funny if they're

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:32.830 
away but it does look funny if they're
sanded<00:01:31.310> away<00:01:31.549> in<00:01:31.850> some<00:01:32.119> parts<00:01:32.420> and<00:01:32.600> not<00:01:32.659> in

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:32.840 
sanded away in some parts and not in

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.559 
sanded away in some parts and not in
others<00:01:33.110> so<00:01:33.920> you'll<00:01:34.280> want<00:01:34.729> to<00:01:34.819> decide<00:01:35.119> one

00:01:35.559 --> 00:01:35.569 
others so you'll want to decide one

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:37.830 
others so you'll want to decide one
approach<00:01:35.869> or<00:01:36.080> the<00:01:36.140> other

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:37.840 
approach or the other

about<00:02:13.700> 7<00:02:14.150> thousandths<00:02:14.690> of<00:02:14.750> an<00:02:14.870> inch<00:02:14.959> deep<00:02:15.290> and

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
about 7 thousandths of an inch deep and

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:20.790 
about 7 thousandths of an inch deep and
now<00:02:16.970> use<00:02:17.209> sand<00:02:17.720> away<00:02:18.140> those<00:02:18.670> the<00:02:19.670> wood<00:02:19.910> until

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:20.800 
now use sand away those the wood until

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.449 
now use sand away those the wood until
the<00:02:21.800> etch<00:02:21.920> marks<00:02:22.250> are<00:02:22.400> gone<00:02:22.580> and<00:02:22.940> that<00:02:23.030> will

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
the etch marks are gone and that will

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:25.580 
the etch marks are gone and that will
about<00:02:23.819> 10<00:02:24.090> thousandths<00:02:24.659> of<00:02:24.959> an<00:02:25.260> inch<00:02:25.349> of

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
about 10 thousandths of an inch of

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.640 
about 10 thousandths of an inch of
material<00:02:26.450> we're<00:02:27.450> working<00:02:27.810> between<00:02:28.109> the<00:02:28.319> waist

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
material we're working between the waist

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:34.009 
material we're working between the waist
and<00:02:29.159> not<00:02:29.549> quite<00:02:29.760> the<00:02:29.969> tail<00:02:32.599> we're<00:02:33.599> working<00:02:33.959> in

00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:34.019 
and not quite the tail we're working in

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:36.229 
and not quite the tail we're working in
the<00:02:34.170> outer<00:02:34.379> inch<00:02:34.709> to<00:02:35.099> two<00:02:35.370> inches<00:02:35.700> and<00:02:36.090> that's

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:36.239 
the outer inch to two inches and that's

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:37.580 
the outer inch to two inches and that's
an<00:02:36.659> optional<00:02:37.079> step

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
an optional step

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.589 
an optional step
okay<00:02:38.280> now<00:02:38.459> the<00:02:38.519> guitar<00:02:39.180> will<00:02:39.269> be<00:02:39.329> a<00:02:39.359> lot<00:02:39.480> more

00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:39.599 
okay now the guitar will be a lot more

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:41.660 
okay now the guitar will be a lot more
comfortable<00:02:39.930> to<00:02:40.079> hold<00:02:40.349> if<00:02:40.650> you<00:02:40.769> chamfer<00:02:41.310> some

sanding<00:02:54.359> paper<00:02:54.540> 150<00:02:55.379> now<00:02:56.040> in<00:02:56.220> the<00:02:56.310> waist<00:02:56.549> you

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
sanding paper 150 now in the waist you

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.879 
sanding paper 150 now in the waist you
have<00:02:57.000> to<00:02:57.150> do<00:02:57.269> that<00:02:57.419> by<00:02:57.540> hand<00:02:57.780> or<00:02:58.439> you<00:02:58.590> could<00:02:58.739> use

00:02:58.879 --> 00:02:58.889 
have to do that by hand or you could use

00:02:58.889 --> 00:03:02.629 
have to do that by hand or you could use
a<00:02:58.919> rubber<00:02:59.220> sanding<00:03:00.060> block<00:03:01.459> here<00:03:02.459> we're<00:03:02.549> doing

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:02.639 
a rubber sanding block here we're doing

00:03:02.639 --> 00:03:04.699 
a rubber sanding block here we're doing
the<00:03:02.819> top<00:03:03.060> with<00:03:03.389> 220<00:03:03.930> grit<00:03:03.959> and<00:03:04.319> lighter

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:04.709 
the top with 220 grit and lighter

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:07.670 
the top with 220 grit and lighter
pressure<00:03:05.069> the<00:03:05.459> Spruce<00:03:05.760> is<00:03:05.970> a<00:03:06.000> lot<00:03:06.329> softer<00:03:07.319> than

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
pressure the Spruce is a lot softer than

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.500 
pressure the Spruce is a lot softer than
the<00:03:07.799> birch<00:03:08.010> so<00:03:08.579> we<00:03:08.849> don't<00:03:09.030> want<00:03:09.150> to<00:03:09.209> take<00:03:09.329> away

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
the birch so we don't want to take away

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.479 
the birch so we don't want to take away
too<00:03:09.569> much<00:03:09.840> here<00:03:10.409> I'm<00:03:10.530> working<00:03:10.859> at<00:03:10.980> a<00:03:11.010> shallow

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:11.489 
too much here I'm working at a shallow

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:14.449 
too much here I'm working at a shallow
angle<00:03:11.639> all<00:03:12.239> the<00:03:12.299> way<00:03:12.450> around<00:03:12.870> and<00:03:13.189> then<00:03:14.189> I<00:03:14.250> do

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459 
angle all the way around and then I do

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:17.569 
angle all the way around and then I do
the<00:03:14.669> waist<00:03:15.290> by<00:03:16.290> hand<00:03:16.650> and<00:03:16.950> I<00:03:17.010> blend

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:17.579 
the waist by hand and I blend

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:21.020 
the waist by hand and I blend
I<00:03:18.260> also<00:03:19.260> inspect<00:03:19.829> how<00:03:20.219> you<00:03:20.280> know<00:03:20.639> form<00:03:20.909> that

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
I also inspect how you know form that

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.449 
I also inspect how you know form that
edges<00:03:21.359> I<00:03:21.389> try<00:03:21.689> to<00:03:21.750> get<00:03:21.870> that<00:03:21.930> burned<00:03:22.560> line<00:03:23.219> the

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
edges I try to get that burned line the

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:26.059 
edges I try to get that burned line the
brown<00:03:23.669> line<00:03:23.939> relatively<00:03:24.719> even<00:03:25.109> around<00:03:25.739> so

00:03:26.059 --> 00:03:26.069 
brown line relatively even around so

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:29.240 
brown line relatively even around so
that's<00:03:26.219> got<00:03:26.459> a<00:03:26.489> little<00:03:26.609> more<00:03:26.760> work<00:03:27.030> to<00:03:27.180> do<00:03:28.250> this

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
that's got a little more work to do this

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:31.520 
that's got a little more work to do this
step<00:03:29.489> is<00:03:29.639> optional<00:03:30.169> you'll<00:03:31.169> probably<00:03:31.319> have

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
step is optional you'll probably have

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:32.930 
step is optional you'll probably have
some<00:03:31.680> regions<00:03:32.040> that<00:03:32.310> your<00:03:32.400> siding<00:03:32.669> is

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
some regions that your siding is

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.629 
some regions that your siding is
sticking<00:03:33.359> out<00:03:33.510> beyond<00:03:34.379> the<00:03:34.949> top<00:03:35.220> or<00:03:35.370> the<00:03:35.459> back

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:35.639 
sticking out beyond the top or the back

00:03:35.639 --> 00:03:38.990 
sticking out beyond the top or the back
and<00:03:35.970> we<00:03:36.060> call<00:03:36.239> that<00:03:36.269> proud<00:03:37.069> so<00:03:38.069> take<00:03:38.340> a<00:03:38.370> sanding

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
and we call that proud so take a sanding

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.809 
and we call that proud so take a sanding
block<00:03:39.030> and<00:03:39.419> just<00:03:40.010> sand<00:03:41.010> on<00:03:41.129> top<00:03:41.310> of<00:03:41.459> it<00:03:41.609> and

00:03:41.809 --> 00:03:41.819 
block and just sand on top of it and

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:44.030 
block and just sand on top of it and
don't<00:03:42.359> go<00:03:42.479> too<00:03:42.540> far<00:03:42.989> if<00:03:43.409> you<00:03:43.620> go<00:03:43.739> too<00:03:43.859> far

don't go too far if you go too far

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.030 
don't go too far if you go too far
you'll<00:03:44.250> start<00:03:44.489> to

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:46.040 
you'll start to
