 you will soon have to make a choice for 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.990
 new windows you will choose 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.429
 the style of windows that suits you 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.320
 do you also wonder what 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.330
 system you will choose question 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.889
 do you know which system is the most 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:18.049
 popular with consumers at 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.049
 canada is the casement window 

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:22.769
 reminds the system again today 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.560
 in Canada 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:27.330
 the best- selling system that's the end 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.330
 the battle has just opened 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.189
 not re-read test results they have 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.040
 obtained from laurent d'olt the window to 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:39.420
 beating can fetch a quote a 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:43.200
 dropped from a3 bessette and c5 acquired and 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:45.390
 the entry by rb which is long and that's the 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.980
 overload to the wines that are said to be very 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.370
 good performance test that goes beyond the 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.370
 Canadian standards 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:53.250
 winter you would not want that 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:54.990
 cool enters your house in the summer 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.910
 you will not want the heat in between 

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:57.270
 at home here is tender online 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.740
 account 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.740
 the thermos of your semester 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:06.820
 we also have all our products 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:07.150
 the human being are certified energy 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:09.760
 star 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:11.590
 we have a product in the code of 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:15.180
 Verdouble which is detailed with the rating r 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:16.840
 at +31 which is in the plu also 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.060
 present but in the market 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:21.070
 if we talk about the fellers fret 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:23.830
 also talking about our triple system 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:26.800
 cold cuts while an external torque of 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:28.600
 and a cold blow on the shutter and on the 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:30.220
 framework at home we believe it's 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.840
 very important to have a cold shot and 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:33.760
 on the shutter and on the frame it is this 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.210
 which gives the greatest performance of 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.640
 the window 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:38.020
 to note very important thing at the 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.690
 Water rat is all our costs 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:42.340
 cold are extruded from the pdci when 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:44.890
 I'm talking about extruded it's when 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:47.380
 short the pvc we use it for cold to 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:49.360
 even the pb is what makes that no 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:51.340
 possibility of infiltration of acts that 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:52.960
 his word is otherwise normal it is 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:57.090
 again what makes you have 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:57.090
 six to performance tests 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:01.780
 important element to take into 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:04.540
 consideration the type of coating of 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:08.160
 your residence will have an effect on the 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:08.160
 type of framing you will choose 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.880
 we have different frame choices at 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:16.040
 laurent d'olt we can have the case of 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:17.930
 flush at four and a half we have a frame 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:21.140
 with self moldings briscous moldings 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:22.520
 hours with hand at five and then 5.8 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:25.100
 different models of moldings 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:26.690
 different widths to fit with 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:27.050
 all openings and the request of the 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:29.570
 customer 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:31.880
 we have a very big novelty 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:34.880
 this year at laurent d'olt we 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:36.280
 have created a frame if it's 9,16 which 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:38.720
 means a much broader framework 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.670
 much more powerful which makes that 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:42.320
 your thermos will end up in the 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:43.730
 part show the wall a lot more 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:45.230
 deep inside your house

 hot plus your family your 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:49.430
 performance 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:50.840
 y 'will and poor opportunities 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:53.300
 condensation that will be done at 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:55.010
 the interior is also there is also 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:57.740
 possibility to put a glass crypt 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:03:00.470
 with an energy glass or two then 

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:02.150
 an argon coating plus the film of 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:03.710
 nitrates the opportunity to redeem 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:05.660
 robert sifts to reach another 

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:07.760
 times higher performance at 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:10.690
 coast level is happy about our 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.690

 durable and efficient hardware 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.310
 level of mechanization part of 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:31.170
 inside we have our human the 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:33.359
 mosquito net which is a mosquito net 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:34.709
 with pressure and not old 

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:37.469
 hook that people are they does 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:40.260
 drink to aim very often very easy 

00:03:37.469 --> 00:03:41.250
 to be removed and returned to 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.379
 level of our window 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:45.810
 we also have a crank is 

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:48.299
 retractable then that fits into the 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:50.819
 casing that do not remain caught in the 

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:52.650
 blinds naturally a smudge 

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:54.629
 multipoint when we talk multipoint 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:56.849
 we talk about a single crank that goes 

00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:59.909
 come barred the window to three places 

00:03:56.849 --> 00:04:03.450
 different to make sure 9 actually 

00:03:59.909 --> 00:04:05.909
 of the tightness of our window while 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:08.370
 We hardware store are available in 

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:10.590
 steel and are available also a stand 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:11.730
 is it what makes that after long term 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:12.719
 we are sure they would not have 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:14.500
 rust that could form at 

00:04:12.719 --> 00:04:16.120
 level of hospitality 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:17.650
 at the color level we have 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:20.769
