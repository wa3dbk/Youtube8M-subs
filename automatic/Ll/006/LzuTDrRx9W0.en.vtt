00:01:45.419 --> 00:01:45.429 
experience kind of the phrase that we

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:47.999 
experience kind of the phrase that we
use<00:01:45.460> is<00:01:45.850> right<00:01:46.179> is<00:01:46.359> that<00:01:46.869> the<00:01:47.499> goal<00:01:47.679> this<00:01:47.829> was

00:01:47.999 --> 00:01:48.009 
use is right is that the goal this was

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:49.649 
use is right is that the goal this was
never<00:01:48.189> to<00:01:48.369> make<00:01:48.520> the<00:01:48.729> best<00:01:48.969> Transformers<00:01:49.509> game

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:49.659

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:51.369 
ever it was to make a great game

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:54.149 
ever it was to make a great game

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:54.159 
that was a Transformers game and so the

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:55.649

was<00:01:55.719> in<00:01:56.109> core<00:01:56.530> solid<00:01:56.979> gameplay<00:01:57.579> mechanics

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:58.090 
was in core solid gameplay mechanics

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:59.639 
was in core solid gameplay mechanics
controls<00:01:58.539> that<00:01:58.719> just<00:01:58.929> feel<00:01:59.079> right<00:01:59.289> under<00:01:59.530> your

00:01:59.639 --> 00:01:59.649 
controls that just feel right under your

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:01.410

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420 
thumb and that informed every other

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.629

them so so how do we express that style
that<00:02:30.939> is<00:02:31.180> Cybertron<00:02:32.170> and<00:02:32.200> bring<00:02:32.469> that<00:02:32.590> to<00:02:32.650> life

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
that is Cybertron and bring that to life

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:34.920 
that is Cybertron and bring that to life

play with you we're using unreal which

play with you we're using unreal which
is<00:02:54.969> a<00:02:55.180> really<00:02:55.599> powerful<00:02:55.780> engine<00:02:56.260> for<00:02:56.409> us<00:02:56.439> and

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
is a really powerful engine for us and

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:57.869 
is a really powerful engine for us and
we've<00:02:56.709> had<00:02:56.829> a<00:02:56.859> chance<00:02:57.099> to<00:02:57.219> do<00:02:57.340> it<00:02:57.370> on<00:02:57.549> previous

00:02:57.869 --> 00:02:57.879 
we've had a chance to do it on previous

00:02:57.879 --> 00:02:59.099 
we've had a chance to do it on previous
games<00:02:58.090> so<00:02:58.239> we<00:02:58.359> knew<00:02:58.480> what<00:02:58.689> we<00:02:58.840> were<00:02:58.959> getting

00:02:59.099 --> 00:02:59.109 
games so we knew what we were getting

00:02:59.109 --> 00:03:01.319 
games so we knew what we were getting
into<00:02:59.349> with<00:02:59.620> that<00:02:59.650> one<00:02:59.949> and<00:03:00.099> it<00:03:00.579> allowed<00:03:00.939> us<00:03:01.180> to

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:01.329 
into with that one and it allowed us to

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:03.149 
into with that one and it allowed us to
create<00:03:01.569> some<00:03:01.810> really<00:03:02.109> I<00:03:02.139> think<00:03:02.260> spectacular

00:03:03.149 --> 00:03:03.159 
create some really I think spectacular

00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:05.580 
create some really I think spectacular
environments<00:03:03.760> so<00:03:04.359> we<00:03:04.480> realized<00:03:04.900> not<00:03:05.199> just<00:03:05.469> the

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
environments so we realized not just the

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:07.530 
environments so we realized not just the
surface<00:03:05.799> world<00:03:06.159> of<00:03:06.310> Cybertron<00:03:06.849> in<00:03:07.090> a<00:03:07.239> couple

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540 
surface world of Cybertron in a couple

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:08.670 
surface world of Cybertron in a couple
different<00:03:07.840> places<00:03:07.900> that<00:03:08.230> you'll<00:03:08.349> go<00:03:08.500> as<00:03:08.650> a

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
different places that you'll go as a

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.470 
different places that you'll go as a
player<00:03:08.949> but<00:03:09.310> you<00:03:09.400> also<00:03:09.549> go<00:03:09.730> underground<00:03:10.209> in

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 
player but you also go underground in

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.619 
player but you also go underground in
Cybertron<00:03:10.989> into<00:03:11.439> some<00:03:11.709> orbital<00:03:12.129> spots<00:03:12.400> around

00:03:12.619 --> 00:03:12.629 
Cybertron into some orbital spots around

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:15.209 
Cybertron into some orbital spots around
Cybertron<00:03:13.629> so<00:03:14.049> you<00:03:14.139> can<00:03:14.260> see<00:03:14.379> it<00:03:14.469> from<00:03:14.590> a<00:03:14.620> lot

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:15.219 
Cybertron so you can see it from a lot

00:03:15.219 --> 00:03:17.159 
Cybertron so you can see it from a lot
of<00:03:15.370> different<00:03:15.699> angles<00:03:15.969> the<00:03:16.659> design<00:03:16.900> cues<00:03:17.109> that

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:17.169 
of different angles the design cues that

00:03:17.169 --> 00:03:19.319 
of different angles the design cues that
we<00:03:17.379> took<00:03:17.560> for<00:03:17.739> Cybertron<00:03:18.280> all<00:03:18.489> or<00:03:18.879> you<00:03:19.209> know

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:19.329 
we took for Cybertron all or you know

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:21.869 
we took for Cybertron all or you know
very<00:03:20.139> based<00:03:20.530> on<00:03:20.680> what<00:03:20.919> kind<00:03:21.189> of<00:03:21.280> story<00:03:21.639> we<00:03:21.790> were

go<00:03:31.239> to<00:03:31.299> other<00:03:31.419> is<00:03:31.840> like<00:03:32.169> the<00:03:32.590> underground<00:03:32.889> it

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250 
go to other is like the underground it

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:34.830 
go to other is like the underground it
feels<00:03:33.459> more<00:03:33.639> like<00:03:33.699> you're<00:03:34.030> inside<00:03:34.419> a<00:03:34.449> giant

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.840 
feels more like you're inside a giant

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.199 
feels more like you're inside a giant
machinery<00:03:35.349> or<00:03:35.680> piece<00:03:36.099> of<00:03:36.159> machinery<00:03:36.459> or<00:03:36.639> giant

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:37.209 
machinery or piece of machinery or giant

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:39.830 
machinery or piece of machinery or giant
clock<00:03:37.419> it's<00:03:37.659> a<00:03:37.750> really<00:03:38.079> much<00:03:38.290> more<00:03:38.530> of<00:03:38.650> a<00:03:38.709> gears

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
clock it's a really much more of a gears

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.569 
clock it's a really much more of a gears
you<00:03:40.840> know<00:03:40.930> at<00:03:41.319> big<00:03:41.620> pieces<00:03:41.859> of<00:03:42.009> machinery<00:03:42.400> and

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:42.579 
you know at big pieces of machinery and

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:44.429 
you know at big pieces of machinery and
Pistons<00:03:43.150> and<00:03:43.329> stuff<00:03:43.509> like<00:03:43.629> that<00:03:43.840> so<00:03:44.319> they<00:03:44.409> have

00:03:44.429 --> 00:03:44.439 
Pistons and stuff like that so they have

00:03:44.439 --> 00:03:46.199 
Pistons and stuff like that so they have
very<00:03:44.530> different<00:03:44.739> feels<00:03:45.430> based<00:03:45.849> on<00:03:46.000> where

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:46.209 
very different feels based on where

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:49.379 
very different feels based on where
you're<00:03:46.359> at<00:03:46.479> in<00:03:46.739> Cybertron<00:03:47.939> look<00:03:48.939> and<00:03:49.180> design

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:49.389 
you're at in Cybertron look and design

00:03:49.389 --> 00:03:51.119 
you're at in Cybertron look and design
of<00:03:49.780> all<00:03:49.900> the<00:03:50.019> characters<00:03:50.379> was<00:03:50.530> also<00:03:50.829> a<00:03:50.859> really

00:03:51.119 --> 00:03:51.129 
of all the characters was also a really

00:03:51.129 --> 00:03:53.039 
of all the characters was also a really
fun<00:03:51.159> thing<00:03:51.579> for<00:03:51.790> us<00:03:52.030> to<00:03:52.180> go<00:03:52.299> through<00:03:52.329> I<00:03:52.750> think

00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:53.049 
fun thing for us to go through I think

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:55.080 
fun thing for us to go through I think
it's<00:03:53.349> really<00:03:53.680> exemplified<00:03:54.519> in<00:03:54.549> the<00:03:54.849> car

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.090 
it's really exemplified in the car

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:56.999 
it's really exemplified in the car
designs<00:03:55.449> that<00:03:55.629> we<00:03:55.750> did<00:03:55.959> and<00:03:56.169> how<00:03:56.409> we<00:03:56.470> found<00:03:56.799> the

00:03:56.999 --> 00:03:57.009 
designs that we did and how we found the

00:03:57.009 --> 00:03:58.439 
designs that we did and how we found the
difference<00:03:57.370> between<00:03:57.549> autobots<00:03:58.299> and

00:03:58.439 --> 00:03:58.449 
difference between autobots and

always hoped that Hasbro would build
toys<00:04:32.979> based<00:04:33.159> off<00:04:33.370> the<00:04:33.520> design

every character that we tackled we

00:04:58.490 --> 00:04:59.889 
every character that we tackled we
really<00:04:58.849> boiled<00:04:59.240> them<00:04:59.330> down<00:04:59.360> to<00:04:59.629> what<00:04:59.779> we

00:04:59.889 --> 00:04:59.899 
really boiled them down to what we

00:04:59.899 --> 00:05:01.480 
really boiled them down to what we

thought were the key elements that made

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:03.549 
thought were the key elements that made
that<00:05:01.729> character<00:05:02.300> them<00:05:02.539> and<00:05:02.839> those<00:05:03.259> were<00:05:03.439> the

00:05:03.549 --> 00:05:03.559 
that character them and those were the

00:05:03.559 --> 00:05:05.529 
that character them and those were the
things<00:05:03.680> that<00:05:03.860> were<00:05:04.009> you<00:05:04.490> know<00:05:04.539> sacrilegious

00:05:05.529 --> 00:05:05.539 
things that were you know sacrilegious

00:05:05.539 --> 00:05:07.149 
things that were you know sacrilegious
to<00:05:05.569> change<00:05:05.930> right<00:05:06.229> because<00:05:06.559> we<00:05:06.680> had<00:05:06.830> to<00:05:06.979> keep

00:05:07.149 --> 00:05:07.159 
to change right because we had to keep

00:05:07.159 --> 00:05:10.540 
to change right because we had to keep
those<00:05:07.729> elements<00:05:08.180> right<00:05:08.629> but<00:05:09.559> we<00:05:10.099> were<00:05:10.219> able<00:05:10.520> to

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:10.550 
those elements right but we were able to

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:12.279 
those elements right but we were able to
have<00:05:10.759> a<00:05:10.789> lot<00:05:11.029> of<00:05:11.149> latitude<00:05:11.479> as<00:05:11.899> long<00:05:12.080> as<00:05:12.169> we

00:05:12.279 --> 00:05:12.289 
have a lot of latitude as long as we

00:05:12.289 --> 00:05:13.689 
have a lot of latitude as long as we
kept<00:05:12.499> those<00:05:12.649> key<00:05:12.860> elements<00:05:12.979> correct<00:05:13.520> so<00:05:13.610> we

00:05:13.689 --> 00:05:13.699 
kept those key elements correct so we

00:05:13.699 --> 00:05:15.219 
kept those key elements correct so we
redesigned<00:05:14.149> Optimus<00:05:14.539> it<00:05:14.659> was<00:05:14.749> about<00:05:14.960> the<00:05:15.080> red

00:05:15.219 --> 00:05:15.229 
redesigned Optimus it was about the red

00:05:15.229 --> 00:05:17.110 
redesigned Optimus it was about the red
and<00:05:15.349> blue<00:05:15.439> color<00:05:15.710> the<00:05:16.129> big<00:05:16.279> chest<00:05:16.639> the<00:05:16.849> pointy

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:17.120 
and blue color the big chest the pointy

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:19.510 
and blue color the big chest the pointy
ears<00:05:17.360> and<00:05:17.539> the<00:05:17.960> broad<00:05:18.169> shoulders<00:05:18.620> right<00:05:18.860> but

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:19.520 
ears and the broad shoulders right but

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:21.100 
ears and the broad shoulders right but
that<00:05:19.639> was<00:05:19.849> kind<00:05:20.120> of<00:05:20.210> those<00:05:20.839> were<00:05:20.990> the

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:21.110 
that was kind of those were the

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:22.540 
that was kind of those were the
unchangeable<00:05:21.860> things<00:05:22.069> that<00:05:22.189> we<00:05:22.279> could<00:05:22.430> do

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:22.550 
unchangeable things that we could do

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:24.129 
unchangeable things that we could do
with<00:05:22.729> Optimus<00:05:23.149> but<00:05:23.360> we<00:05:23.569> had<00:05:23.749> a<00:05:23.779> lot<00:05:23.990> of

00:05:24.129 --> 00:05:24.139 
with Optimus but we had a lot of

00:05:24.139 --> 00:05:26.049 
with Optimus but we had a lot of
latitude<00:05:24.439> with<00:05:24.770> which<00:05:24.919> to<00:05:25.129> redesign<00:05:25.520> him<00:05:25.909> and

00:05:26.049 --> 00:05:26.059 
latitude with which to redesign him and

00:05:26.059 --> 00:05:28.119 
latitude with which to redesign him and
reshape<00:05:26.419> him<00:05:26.599> and<00:05:26.779> what<00:05:27.020> his<00:05:27.199> Cybertron<00:05:27.830> form

00:05:28.119 --> 00:05:28.129 
reshape him and what his Cybertron form

00:05:28.129 --> 00:05:31.269 
reshape him and what his Cybertron form
would<00:05:28.279> be<00:05:28.459> and<00:05:28.699> so<00:05:29.270> those<00:05:29.629> designs<00:05:30.169> we<00:05:31.009> kind<00:05:31.189> of

00:05:31.269 --> 00:05:31.279 
would be and so those designs we kind of

00:05:31.279 --> 00:05:32.829 
would be and so those designs we kind of
beat<00:05:31.490> those<00:05:31.729> up<00:05:31.939> for<00:05:32.149> a<00:05:32.209> while<00:05:32.449> and<00:05:32.479> had<00:05:32.809> a

00:05:32.829 --> 00:05:32.839 
beat those up for a while and had a

00:05:32.839 --> 00:05:34.839 
beat those up for a while and had a
great<00:05:33.110> time<00:05:33.289> with<00:05:33.469> it<00:05:33.619> and<00:05:33.770> then<00:05:33.919> use<00:05:34.550> that<00:05:34.580> as

00:05:34.839 --> 00:05:34.849 
great time with it and then use that as

00:05:34.849 --> 00:05:36.429 
great time with it and then use that as
our<00:05:35.119> springboard<00:05:35.599> for<00:05:35.749> every<00:05:35.990> other<00:05:36.080> design

00:05:36.429 --> 00:05:36.439 
our springboard for every other design

00:05:36.439 --> 00:05:37.719 
our springboard for every other design
that<00:05:36.589> we<00:05:36.680> did<00:05:36.800> from<00:05:36.949> there<00:05:37.129> is<00:05:37.249> once<00:05:37.459> we<00:05:37.580> kind

00:05:37.719 --> 00:05:37.729 
that we did from there is once we kind

00:05:37.729 --> 00:05:40.269 
that we did from there is once we kind
of<00:05:37.789> figured<00:05:38.120> out<00:05:38.529> what<00:05:39.529> to<00:05:39.559> keep<00:05:39.830> and<00:05:39.979> what<00:05:40.069> not

00:05:40.269 --> 00:05:40.279 
of figured out what to keep and what not

00:05:40.279 --> 00:05:41.409 
of figured out what to keep and what not
to<00:05:40.430> keep<00:05:40.580> out<00:05:40.729> of<00:05:40.849> each<00:05:40.969> character<00:05:41.330> and

00:05:41.409 --> 00:05:41.419 
to keep out of each character and

00:05:41.419 --> 00:05:42.790 
to keep out of each character and
obviously<00:05:41.809> we<00:05:41.899> worked<00:05:42.110> really<00:05:42.319> closely<00:05:42.589> with

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:42.800 
obviously we worked really closely with

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:45.249 
obviously we worked really closely with
Hasbro<00:05:43.099> on<00:05:43.399> that<00:05:43.610> those<00:05:44.569> were<00:05:44.809> the<00:05:44.930> central

00:05:45.249 --> 00:05:45.259 
Hasbro on that those were the central

00:05:45.259 --> 00:05:46.689 
Hasbro on that those were the central
language<00:05:45.589> that<00:05:45.770> we<00:05:45.860> kept<00:05:46.099> about<00:05:46.279> everyone

00:05:46.689 --> 00:05:46.699 
language that we kept about everyone

00:05:46.699 --> 00:05:48.850 
language that we kept about everyone
controls<00:05:47.659> were<00:05:48.050> something<00:05:48.409> that<00:05:48.439> we<00:05:48.559> spent<00:05:48.800> a

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:48.860 
controls were something that we spent a

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:50.559 
controls were something that we spent a
huge<00:05:49.309> amount<00:05:49.699> of<00:05:49.759> time<00:05:49.969> on<00:05:50.149> getting<00:05:50.330> the

00:05:50.559 --> 00:05:50.569 
huge amount of time on getting the

00:05:50.569 --> 00:05:52.360 
huge amount of time on getting the
controls<00:05:50.959> to<00:05:51.110> just<00:05:51.379> feel<00:05:51.680> right<00:05:51.919> and<00:05:52.099> one<00:05:52.279> of

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:52.370 
controls to just feel right and one of

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:53.829 
controls to just feel right and one of
the<00:05:52.459> key<00:05:52.699> aspects<00:05:53.149> to<00:05:53.330> that<00:05:53.360> was

00:05:53.829 --> 00:05:53.839 
the key aspects to that was

00:05:53.839 --> 00:05:55.570 
the key aspects to that was
transformation<00:05:54.589> right<00:05:54.709> it's<00:05:54.919> a<00:05:54.979> Transformers

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:55.580 
transformation right it's a Transformers

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:57.790 
transformation right it's a Transformers
game<00:05:55.870> transforming<00:05:56.870> should<00:05:57.050> feel<00:05:57.289> fun<00:05:57.589> it

00:05:57.790 --> 00:05:57.800 
game transforming should feel fun it

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:59.230 
game transforming should feel fun it
should<00:05:57.949> be<00:05:58.039> a<00:05:58.069> key<00:05:58.339> part<00:05:58.610> of<00:05:58.669> the<00:05:58.759> strategy

00:05:59.230 --> 00:05:59.240 
should be a key part of the strategy

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:01.299 
should be a key part of the strategy
that<00:05:59.300> you<00:05:59.479> use<00:05:59.629> and<00:06:00.139> so<00:06:00.740> there<00:06:00.949> are<00:06:01.069> no

00:06:01.299 --> 00:06:01.309 
that you use and so there are no

00:06:01.309 --> 00:06:02.799 
that you use and so there are no
restrictions<00:06:01.459> on<00:06:01.939> transformation<00:06:02.659> you<00:06:02.779> can

00:06:02.799 --> 00:06:02.809 
restrictions on transformation you can

00:06:02.809 --> 00:06:04.989 
restrictions on transformation you can
transform<00:06:03.379> whatever<00:06:03.589> you<00:06:03.979> want<00:06:04.219> to<00:06:04.430> there's

00:06:04.989 --> 00:06:04.999 
transform whatever you want to there's

00:06:04.999 --> 00:06:06.549 
transform whatever you want to there's
certainly<00:06:05.240> areas<00:06:05.449> where<00:06:05.809> we<00:06:05.930> encourage<00:06:06.409> you

00:06:06.549 --> 00:06:06.559 
certainly areas where we encourage you

00:06:06.559 --> 00:06:08.320 
certainly areas where we encourage you
to<00:06:06.589> be<00:06:06.800> in<00:06:06.919> one<00:06:07.099> form<00:06:07.370> or<00:06:07.459> another<00:06:07.550> but

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:08.330 
to be in one form or another but

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:10.059 
to be in one form or another but
honestly<00:06:08.689> it's<00:06:08.839> up<00:06:08.990> to<00:06:09.110> you<00:06:09.259> you<00:06:09.620> can<00:06:09.769> play<00:06:09.889> the

00:06:10.059 --> 00:06:10.069 
honestly it's up to you you can play the

00:06:10.069 --> 00:06:11.679 
honestly it's up to you you can play the
game<00:06:10.189> as<00:06:10.370> however<00:06:10.669> you<00:06:10.999> want<00:06:11.209> to<00:06:11.300> and<00:06:11.389> and

game as however you want to and and

00:06:11.689 --> 00:06:13.509 
game as however you want to and and
certainly<00:06:12.019> a<00:06:12.050> really<00:06:12.409> viable<00:06:12.709> strategy<00:06:13.279> is<00:06:13.370> to

00:06:13.509 --> 00:06:13.519 
certainly a really viable strategy is to

00:06:13.519 --> 00:06:15.100 
certainly a really viable strategy is to
use<00:06:13.550> your<00:06:13.819> vehicle<00:06:13.969> weapons<00:06:14.509> or<00:06:14.629> your<00:06:14.749> vehicle

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:15.110 
use your vehicle weapons or your vehicle

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:18.009 
use your vehicle weapons or your vehicle
form<00:06:15.379> in<00:06:16.219> certain<00:06:16.519> combats<00:06:16.909> and<00:06:17.120> use<00:06:17.689> your

00:06:18.009 --> 00:06:18.019 
form in certain combats and use your

00:06:18.019 --> 00:06:19.959 
form in certain combats and use your
robot<00:06:18.289> form<00:06:18.589> in<00:06:18.680> other<00:06:18.769> combats<00:06:19.249> and<00:06:19.490> you<00:06:19.879> know

00:06:19.959 --> 00:06:19.969 
robot form in other combats and you know

00:06:19.969 --> 00:06:21.459 
robot form in other combats and you know
my<00:06:20.120> personal<00:06:20.479> favorite<00:06:20.870> is<00:06:20.930> to<00:06:21.080> transform

00:06:21.459 --> 00:06:21.469 
my personal favorite is to transform

00:06:21.469 --> 00:06:23.889 
my personal favorite is to transform
often<00:06:21.949> so<00:06:22.430> off<00:06:22.759> you<00:06:23.209> see<00:06:23.449> lots<00:06:23.629> of<00:06:23.749> other

00:06:23.889 --> 00:06:23.899 
often so off you see lots of other

00:06:23.899 --> 00:06:25.420 
often so off you see lots of other
gamers<00:06:24.169> transforming<00:06:24.830> frequently<00:06:25.249> between

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:25.430 
gamers transforming frequently between

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:27.309 
gamers transforming frequently between
the<00:06:25.669> two<00:06:25.819> forms<00:06:26.059> as<00:06:26.330> they<00:06:26.809> are<00:06:27.050> playing

00:06:27.309 --> 00:06:27.319 
the two forms as they are playing

00:06:27.319 --> 00:06:35.080 
the two forms as they are playing
through<00:06:27.529> the<00:06:27.649> game
