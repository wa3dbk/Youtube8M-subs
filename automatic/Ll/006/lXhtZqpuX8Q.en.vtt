liner<00:02:52.129> in<00:02:52.310> here<00:02:52.459> it's<00:02:52.579> a<00:02:52.700> mesh<00:02:53.120> heel<00:02:53.389> liner<00:02:53.659> but

00:02:54.159 --> 00:02:54.169 
liner in here it's a mesh heel liner but

00:02:54.169 --> 00:02:56.050 
liner in here it's a mesh heel liner but
it<00:02:54.290> has<00:02:54.409> some<00:02:54.560> nice<00:02:54.739> thicker<00:02:55.220> padding<00:02:55.760> behind

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
it has some nice thicker padding behind

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:57.640 
it has some nice thicker padding behind
it<00:02:56.180> that's<00:02:56.299> not<00:02:56.480> too<00:02:56.750> soft<00:02:57.019> it's<00:02:57.290> kind<00:02:57.470> of<00:02:57.500> got

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650 
it that's not too soft it's kind of got

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:59.800 
it that's not too soft it's kind of got
some<00:02:57.829> shape<00:02:58.790> to<00:02:58.819> it<00:02:59.060> which<00:02:59.269> I<00:02:59.389> think<00:02:59.599> feels

00:02:59.800 --> 00:02:59.810 
some shape to it which I think feels

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:01.720 
some shape to it which I think feels
really<00:03:00.049> good<00:03:00.260> then<00:03:00.769> the<00:03:00.889> insole<00:03:01.250> is<00:03:01.280> on<00:03:01.639> the

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730 
really good then the insole is on the

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:04.119 
really good then the insole is on the
inside<00:03:02.269> as<00:03:02.389> well<00:03:02.419> EV<00:03:02.870> a<00:03:02.900> foam<00:03:03.230> it<00:03:03.560> is<00:03:03.829> non

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:06.159 
inside as well EV a foam it is non
removable<00:03:04.370> so<00:03:04.760> just<00:03:04.970> keep<00:03:05.090> that<00:03:05.150> in<00:03:05.299> mind<00:03:05.599> as

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:06.169 
removable so just keep that in mind as

00:03:06.169 --> 00:03:07.720 
removable so just keep that in mind as
far<00:03:06.200> as<00:03:06.439> the<00:03:06.530> sole<00:03:06.709> is<00:03:06.799> concerned<00:03:07.099> it's<00:03:07.310> it's

warriors kind of unique turf pattern on

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:12.099 
warriors kind of unique turf pattern on
there<00:03:10.430> again<00:03:11.030> I<00:03:11.209> said<00:03:11.269> this<00:03:11.450> before<00:03:11.689> with<00:03:11.989> the

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:12.109 
there again I said this before with the

00:03:12.109 --> 00:03:13.780 
there again I said this before with the
turf<00:03:12.260> pounds<00:03:12.650> they<00:03:12.709> all<00:03:12.859> perform<00:03:13.280> very<00:03:13.549> very

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790 
turf pounds they all perform very very

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:15.909 
turf pounds they all perform very very
similar<00:03:14.180> similarly<00:03:14.989> if<00:03:15.200> you<00:03:15.590> are<00:03:15.680> going<00:03:15.799> to<00:03:15.859> be

00:03:15.909 --> 00:03:15.919 
similar similarly if you are going to be

00:03:15.919 --> 00:03:17.770 
similar similarly if you are going to be
playing<00:03:16.069> on<00:03:16.220> artificial<00:03:16.609> grass<00:03:16.939> so<00:03:17.450> I<00:03:17.510> expect

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:17.780 
playing on artificial grass so I expect

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:19.960 
playing on artificial grass so I expect
it<00:03:17.900> to<00:03:18.019> perform<00:03:18.650> pretty<00:03:18.859> well<00:03:18.979> it's<00:03:19.609> kind<00:03:19.849> of<00:03:19.879> a

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:19.970 
it to perform pretty well it's kind of a

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:21.640 
it to perform pretty well it's kind of a
combination<00:03:20.150> of<00:03:20.599> little<00:03:20.900> round<00:03:21.109> knobs<00:03:21.379> and

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
combination of little round knobs and

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:23.080 
combination of little round knobs and
you<00:03:21.709> have<00:03:21.859> some<00:03:22.040> bladed<00:03:22.400> knobs<00:03:22.579> on<00:03:22.790> there<00:03:22.970> as

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
you have some bladed knobs on there as

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:24.729 
you have some bladed knobs on there as
well<00:03:23.269> and<00:03:23.540> like<00:03:24.049> I<00:03:24.109> said<00:03:24.169> it<00:03:24.379> should<00:03:24.590> perform

00:03:24.729 --> 00:03:24.739 
well and like I said it should perform

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:27.069 
well and like I said it should perform
pretty<00:03:25.099> well<00:03:25.220> on<00:03:25.549> artificial<00:03:26.000> grass<00:03:26.359> that's

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:27.079 
pretty well on artificial grass that's

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:28.390 
pretty well on artificial grass that's
pretty<00:03:27.319> much<00:03:27.409> it<00:03:27.470> as<00:03:27.680> far<00:03:27.739> as<00:03:27.919> the<00:03:28.010> unboxing

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:28.400

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:31.579 
I'll move on to the on feet so you can

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:34.330 
I'll move on to the on feet so you can
see<00:03:31.729> how<00:03:31.849> they<00:03:32.000> fit<00:03:32.709> alright<00:03:33.709> here's<00:03:34.069> a<00:03:34.129> look

see how they fit alright here's a look

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:37.059 
see how they fit alright here's a look
at<00:03:34.549> the<00:03:34.760> Blitz<00:03:35.060> puts<00:03:35.329> all<00:03:35.510> Astros<00:03:36.079> on<00:03:36.319> feet<00:03:36.680> and

00:03:37.059 --> 00:03:37.069 
at the Blitz puts all Astros on feet and

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:38.469 
at the Blitz puts all Astros on feet and
I'm<00:03:37.190> actually<00:03:37.370> pretty<00:03:37.669> happy<00:03:37.790> with<00:03:38.180> how<00:03:38.239> they

00:03:38.469 --> 00:03:38.479 
I'm actually pretty happy with how they

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:40.360 
I'm actually pretty happy with how they
feel<00:03:38.750> normally<00:03:39.620> I'm<00:03:39.709> not<00:03:39.859> a<00:03:39.889> big<00:03:40.129> fan<00:03:40.159> of

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:40.370 
feel normally I'm not a big fan of

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:42.640 
feel normally I'm not a big fan of
soccer<00:03:40.729> shoes<00:03:41.060> that<00:03:41.239> use<00:03:41.359> mesh<00:03:41.659> uppers<00:03:42.139> but

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:42.650 
soccer shoes that use mesh uppers but

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:44.050 
soccer shoes that use mesh uppers but
this<00:03:42.799> one<00:03:42.949> feels<00:03:43.190> really<00:03:43.549> good<00:03:43.790> in<00:03:43.849> my<00:03:44.030> opinion

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:44.060 
this one feels really good in my opinion

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:46.750 
this one feels really good in my opinion
has<00:03:44.900> a<00:03:44.930> nice<00:03:45.229> solid<00:03:45.530> feel<00:03:45.889> to<00:03:46.129> it<00:03:46.159> and<00:03:46.459> I<00:03:46.579> think

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:46.760 
has a nice solid feel to it and I think

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:48.189 
has a nice solid feel to it and I think
that's<00:03:46.879> because<00:03:47.000> there's<00:03:47.329> lots<00:03:47.569> of<00:03:47.690> supports

00:03:48.189 --> 00:03:48.199 
that's because there's lots of supports

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:49.750 
that's because there's lots of supports
with<00:03:48.409> the<00:03:48.560> synthetic<00:03:48.769> leather<00:03:49.190> rocking

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:49.760 
with the synthetic leather rocking

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:52.300 
with the synthetic leather rocking
around<00:03:49.879> the<00:03:50.569> outsides<00:03:51.049> of<00:03:51.260> the<00:03:51.319> shoe<00:03:51.650> so<00:03:52.129> for

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:52.310 
around the outsides of the shoe so for

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:53.949 
around the outsides of the shoe so for
that<00:03:52.400> reason<00:03:52.459> it<00:03:52.909> has<00:03:53.030> the<00:03:53.150> nice<00:03:53.299> flexibility

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:53.959 
that reason it has the nice flexibility

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:55.869 
that reason it has the nice flexibility
of<00:03:54.049> a<00:03:54.290> mess<00:03:54.470> you<00:03:54.500> but<00:03:55.220> it's<00:03:55.310> not<00:03:55.459> going<00:03:55.579> to<00:03:55.669> feel

00:03:55.869 --> 00:03:55.879 
of a mess you but it's not going to feel

00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:58.750 
of a mess you but it's not going to feel
cheap<00:03:56.359> like<00:03:56.569> a<00:03:56.599> mesh<00:03:56.900> you<00:03:57.109> can<00:03:57.379> feel<00:03:57.680> that<00:03:58.639> I've

00:03:58.750 --> 00:03:58.760 
cheap like a mesh you can feel that I've

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:01.089 
cheap like a mesh you can feel that I've
experienced<00:03:59.299> anyways<00:03:59.599> as<00:04:00.169> far<00:04:00.439> as<00:04:00.470> sizing<00:04:00.799> or

00:04:01.089 --> 00:04:01.099 
experienced anyways as far as sizing or

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:02.649 
experienced anyways as far as sizing or
the<00:04:01.370> width<00:04:01.579> of<00:04:01.699> the<00:04:01.790> shoe<00:04:01.909> is<00:04:02.030> concerned<00:04:02.389> I

00:04:02.649 --> 00:04:02.659 
the width of the shoe is concerned I

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:04.119 
the width of the shoe is concerned I
would<00:04:03.049> say<00:04:03.139> it's<00:04:03.260> about<00:04:03.349> an<00:04:03.530> average<00:04:03.709> width

00:04:04.119 --> 00:04:04.129 
would say it's about an average width

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:05.439 
would say it's about an average width
through<00:04:04.340> the<00:04:04.459> myth<00:04:04.609> but<00:04:04.819> as<00:04:04.970> you<00:04:05.120> guys<00:04:05.239> can<00:04:05.389> see

00:04:05.439 --> 00:04:05.449 
through the myth but as you guys can see

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:07.330 
through the myth but as you guys can see
here<00:04:05.810> and<00:04:06.169> then<00:04:06.409> it's<00:04:06.530> a<00:04:06.560> lot<00:04:06.590> more<00:04:06.739> roomy<00:04:07.220> in

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:07.340 
here and then it's a lot more roomy in

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:09.280 
here and then it's a lot more roomy in
the<00:04:07.430> forefoot<00:04:07.819> in<00:04:07.939> toe<00:04:08.060> box<00:04:08.269> the<00:04:08.780> fit<00:04:08.989> is<00:04:09.109> still

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:09.290 
the forefoot in toe box the fit is still

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:10.749 
the forefoot in toe box the fit is still
pretty<00:04:09.439> good<00:04:09.620> like<00:04:09.829> I<00:04:09.919> said<00:04:10.129> for<00:04:10.280> a<00:04:10.310> mess<00:04:10.519> you
