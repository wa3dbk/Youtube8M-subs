00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:42.709 
multiple of 4 plus 2 so this train I've

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:45.280 
multiple of 4 plus 2 so this train I've
got<00:03:42.830> right<00:03:42.950> here<00:03:42.980> this<00:03:43.250> is<00:03:43.310> 18<00:03:43.880> stitches<00:03:44.290> 16

got right here this is 18 stitches 16

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:49.120 
got right here this is 18 stitches 16
which<00:03:45.560> is<00:03:45.590> multiple<00:03:46.070> of<00:03:46.160> 4<00:03:46.400> plus<00:03:46.970> 2<00:03:47.269> is<00:03:47.300> 18<00:03:48.130> and

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:49.130 
which is multiple of 4 plus 2 is 18 and

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:52.420 
which is multiple of 4 plus 2 is 18 and
we'll<00:03:49.370> start<00:03:50.320> find<00:03:51.320> the<00:03:51.470> 7th<00:03:51.920> chain<00:03:52.190> from<00:03:52.400> the

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:52.430 
we'll start find the 7th chain from the

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:56.500 
we'll start find the 7th chain from the
hook<00:03:52.550> so<00:03:52.910> 1<00:03:53.120> 2<00:03:53.450> 3<00:03:53.780> 4<00:03:54.200> 5<00:03:54.470> 6<00:03:54.830> 7<00:03:55.730> is<00:03:56.030> that<00:03:56.239> one<00:03:56.360> right

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:56.510 
hook so 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 is that one right

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:57.580 
hook so 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 is that one right
there<00:03:56.780> and<00:03:56.930> that's<00:03:57.050> where<00:03:57.290> we're<00:03:57.380> going<00:03:57.530> to

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:10.449 
pull it through you've got three loops
on<00:04:07.820> your<00:04:07.880> hook<00:04:08.350> pull<00:04:09.350> through<00:04:09.530> two<00:04:09.830> and<00:04:10.130> then

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:10.459 
on your hook pull through two and then

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:16.140 
on your hook pull through two and then
pull<00:04:10.700> through<00:04:11.170> two<00:04:12.640> so<00:04:13.640> two<00:04:14.650> doubles

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:16.150 
pull through two so two doubles

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:18.920 
pull through two so two doubles
chain<00:04:17.150> two

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:18.930 
chain two

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:21.710 
chain two
and<00:04:19.049> then<00:04:20.039> two<00:04:20.370> more<00:04:20.519> doubles<00:04:20.910> in<00:04:21.060> that<00:04:21.329> same

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:21.720 
and then two more doubles in that same

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:30.720 
and then two more doubles in that same
chain<00:04:22.470> stitch

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:30.730 

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:34.700 

so<00:04:31.390> that<00:04:31.630> is<00:04:31.870> our<00:04:32.110> shell<00:04:32.500> two<00:04:33.100> two<00:04:33.700> and<00:04:34.000> two

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:34.710 
so that is our shell two two and two

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:38.160 
so that is our shell two two and two
then<00:04:35.710> you'll<00:04:35.860> skip<00:04:36.130> the<00:04:36.370> next<00:04:36.520> three<00:04:37.360> chain

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:38.170 
then you'll skip the next three chain

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:39.570 
then you'll skip the next three chain
stitches<00:04:38.200> so<00:04:38.740> I'm<00:04:38.800> skipping<00:04:39.070> all<00:04:39.220> three<00:04:39.490> of

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:39.580 
stitches so I'm skipping all three of

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:43.530 
stitches so I'm skipping all three of
those<00:04:39.730> and<00:04:40.060> then<00:04:40.780> the<00:04:40.930> fourth<00:04:41.290> one<00:04:42.360> will<00:04:43.360> work

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:43.540 
those and then the fourth one will work

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:46.650 
those and then the fourth one will work
another<00:04:44.260> shell<00:04:44.650> so<00:04:45.310> that's<00:04:45.490> two<00:04:46.030> more<00:04:46.300> double

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:46.660 
another shell so that's two more double

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:54.990 
another shell so that's two more double
crochets<00:04:51.180> two<00:04:52.180> chains<00:04:52.510> and<00:04:53.640> then<00:04:54.640> two<00:04:54.850> more

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:55.000 
crochets two chains and then two more

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:04.960 
crochets two chains and then two more
double<00:04:55.270> crochets<00:04:55.660> in<00:04:55.900> the<00:04:56.080> same<00:04:56.260> stitch

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:04.970 

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:07.450 

so<00:05:05.630> we'll<00:05:05.750> just<00:05:05.930> finish<00:05:06.050> that<00:05:06.320> across<00:05:06.650> skip

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:07.460 
so we'll just finish that across skip

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:09.340 
so we'll just finish that across skip
the<00:05:07.610> next<00:05:07.760> three<00:05:08.360> work<00:05:08.930> a<00:05:09.020> double<00:05:09.050> crochet

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:09.350 
the next three work a double crochet

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:13.120 
the next three work a double crochet
there<00:05:09.890> and<00:05:10.160> then<00:05:10.340> you<00:05:10.460> should<00:05:10.700> end<00:05:10.940> with<00:05:12.130> after

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:13.130 
there and then you should end with after

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:14.410 
there and then you should end with after
you<00:05:13.220> do<00:05:13.310> that<00:05:13.340> you<00:05:13.550> should<00:05:13.670> have<00:05:13.820> three<00:05:14.120> chains

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:14.420 
you do that you should have three chains

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:17.470 
you do that you should have three chains
left<00:05:14.720> you'll<00:05:15.590> skip<00:05:15.890> two<00:05:16.190> and<00:05:16.220> work<00:05:16.700> just<00:05:16.730> one

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:17.480 
left you'll skip two and work just one

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:19.510 
left you'll skip two and work just one
double<00:05:18.020> crochet<00:05:18.440> in<00:05:18.650> that<00:05:18.680> very<00:05:19.010> last<00:05:19.280> chain

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:19.520 
double crochet in that very last chain

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:21.160 
double crochet in that very last chain
so<00:05:19.700> I'm<00:05:19.760> going<00:05:19.880> to<00:05:19.910> finish<00:05:20.150> out<00:05:20.300> this<00:05:20.450> row<00:05:20.660> I'll

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:21.170 
so I'm going to finish out this row I'll

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:24.550 
so I'm going to finish out this row I'll
come<00:05:21.290> back<00:05:21.410> and<00:05:21.560> show<00:05:21.710> you<00:05:21.740> Row<00:05:22.040> two<00:05:23.560> so

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:24.560 
come back and show you Row two so

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:27.040 
come back and show you Row two so
there's<00:05:24.770> Row<00:05:25.040> one<00:05:25.450> remember<00:05:26.450> I<00:05:26.480> started<00:05:26.810> with

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:27.050 
there's Row one remember I started with

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:29.560 
there's Row one remember I started with
a<00:05:27.080> chain<00:05:27.350> of<00:05:27.380> 18<00:05:28.040> and<00:05:28.700> that<00:05:28.940> gave<00:05:29.120> me<00:05:29.150> three

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:29.570 
a chain of 18 and that gave me three

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:30.940 
a chain of 18 and that gave me three
shells<00:05:29.840> across<00:05:30.080> the<00:05:30.350> middle<00:05:30.560> there<00:05:30.740> and<00:05:30.860> then

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:30.950 
shells across the middle there and then

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:33.370 
shells across the middle there and then
I've<00:05:31.040> got<00:05:31.160> a<00:05:31.190> double<00:05:31.550> crochet<00:05:31.700> on<00:05:32.030> each<00:05:32.150> end<00:05:32.600> so

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:33.380 
I've got a double crochet on each end so

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:35.260 
I've got a double crochet on each end so
moving<00:05:33.680> on<00:05:33.800> to<00:05:33.920> row<00:05:34.250> two<00:05:34.310> this<00:05:34.850> will<00:05:35.030> be<00:05:35.120> your

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:35.270 
moving on to row two this will be your

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:39.510 
moving on to row two this will be your
repeat<00:05:35.690> row<00:05:36.550> start<00:05:37.550> by<00:05:37.640> chaining<00:05:37.940> three<00:05:38.330> in

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:39.520 
repeat row start by chaining three in

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:42.760 
repeat row start by chaining three in
turn<00:05:40.520> and<00:05:41.330> then<00:05:42.260> you're<00:05:42.350> going<00:05:42.440> to<00:05:42.500> work<00:05:42.620> a

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:42.770 
turn and then you're going to work a

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:46.270 
turn and then you're going to work a
shell<00:05:43.070> in<00:05:43.370> each<00:05:44.030> shell<00:05:44.570> across<00:05:45.170> so<00:05:45.530> just<00:05:46.100> right

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:46.280 
shell in each shell across so just right

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:47.860 
shell in each shell across so just right
here<00:05:46.520> in<00:05:46.610> the<00:05:46.700> middle<00:05:46.910> of<00:05:47.030> this<00:05:47.270> shell<00:05:47.540> will

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:47.870 
here in the middle of this shell will

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:49.930 
here in the middle of this shell will
work<00:05:48.080> another<00:05:48.320> one<00:05:48.560> yarn<00:05:48.800> over<00:05:48.890> go<00:05:49.700> right

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:49.940 
work another one yarn over go right

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:51.640 
work another one yarn over go right
under<00:05:50.240> that<00:05:50.270> chain<00:05:50.630> two<00:05:50.870> loop<00:05:51.110> grab<00:05:51.380> a<00:05:51.470> loop

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:51.650 
under that chain two loop grab a loop

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:54.490 
under that chain two loop grab a loop
pull<00:05:51.830> it<00:05:51.860> through<00:05:52.900> there's<00:05:53.900> one<00:05:54.170> double

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:54.500 
pull it through there's one double

00:05:54.500 --> 00:06:01.690 
pull it through there's one double
crochet<00:05:56.980> two<00:05:57.980> chain<00:05:58.660> two<00:05:59.660> and<00:06:00.250> then<00:06:01.250> two<00:06:01.460> more

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:01.700 
crochet two chain two and then two more

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:05.710 
crochet two chain two and then two more
all<00:06:02.300> in<00:06:02.840> the<00:06:02.990> same<00:06:03.940> little<00:06:04.940> loop<00:06:05.180> there<00:06:05.450> in<00:06:05.630> the

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:05.720 
all in the same little loop there in the

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:10.990 
all in the same little loop there in the
middle<00:06:06.020> of<00:06:06.260> the<00:06:06.970> previous<00:06:07.970> shell<00:06:09.190> and<00:06:10.190> you'll

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:11.000 
middle of the previous shell and you'll

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.020 
middle of the previous shell and you'll
just<00:06:11.180> do<00:06:11.360> that<00:06:11.510> across<00:06:12.790> so<00:06:13.790> we'll<00:06:13.910> have

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:14.030 
just do that across so we'll have

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:16.030 
just do that across so we'll have
another<00:06:14.270> shell<00:06:14.540> right<00:06:14.810> there<00:06:15.140> we'll<00:06:15.890> have

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:16.040 
another shell right there we'll have

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:19.360 
another shell right there we'll have
another<00:06:16.250> shell<00:06:16.550> right<00:06:16.790> there<00:06:17.210> and<00:06:17.770> then<00:06:18.770> we'll

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:19.370 
another shell right there and then we'll

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:21.040 
another shell right there and then we'll
do<00:06:19.490> a<00:06:19.520> double<00:06:19.700> crochet<00:06:19.940> on<00:06:20.270> the<00:06:20.480> top<00:06:20.690> of<00:06:20.900> the

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:21.050 
do a double crochet on the top of the

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:23.230 
do a double crochet on the top of the
double<00:06:21.200> crochet<00:06:21.380> which<00:06:21.919> in<00:06:22.040> this<00:06:22.160> case<00:06:22.400> is<00:06:22.669> the

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:23.240 
double crochet which in this case is the

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:26.140 
double crochet which in this case is the
turning<00:06:23.630> chain<00:06:23.660> from<00:06:24.169> Row<00:06:24.350> one<00:06:24.620> so<00:06:25.130> just<00:06:25.340> put<00:06:26.120> a

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:26.150 
turning chain from Row one so just put a

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:27.730 
turning chain from Row one so just put a
double<00:06:26.480> crochet<00:06:26.570> right<00:06:26.990> in<00:06:27.169> the<00:06:27.260> top<00:06:27.470> there

00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:27.740 
double crochet right in the top there

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:30.040 
double crochet right in the top there
and<00:06:27.860> that's<00:06:28.040> really<00:06:28.160> all<00:06:28.490> there<00:06:28.700> is<00:06:28.730> to<00:06:28.850> it<00:06:29.270> you

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:30.050 
and that's really all there is to it you

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:32.080 
and that's really all there is to it you
know<00:06:30.620> this<00:06:30.800> works<00:06:31.010> up<00:06:31.160> really<00:06:31.430> nicely<00:06:31.669> I<00:06:31.910> think

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:32.090 
know this works up really nicely I think

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:35.500 
know this works up really nicely I think
it<00:06:32.330> looks<00:06:32.570> more<00:06:32.780> complicated<00:06:33.500> than<00:06:33.710> it<00:06:33.860> is<00:06:34.510> so

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:35.510 
it looks more complicated than it is so
