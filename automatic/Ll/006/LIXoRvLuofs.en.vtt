00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:18.640 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.310 

sometimes<00:01:19.640> it's<00:01:19.850> difficult<00:01:20.000> to<00:01:20.420> get<00:01:20.660> the<00:01:20.720> cuff

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:21.320 
sometimes it's difficult to get the cuff

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.640 
sometimes it's difficult to get the cuff
to<00:01:21.590> line<00:01:21.860> up<00:01:22.130> perfectly<00:01:23.110> well<00:01:24.110> with<00:01:24.560> the

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:24.650 
to line up perfectly well with the

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:26.380 
to line up perfectly well with the
placket<00:01:24.950> as<00:01:25.280> the<00:01:25.430> original<00:01:25.910> shirt<00:01:26.090> did

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:26.390 
placket as the original shirt did

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:30.040 
placket as the original shirt did
sometimes<00:01:27.229> it's<00:01:27.650> off<00:01:27.920> to<00:01:28.550> the<00:01:28.729> edge<00:01:29.330> just<00:01:29.930> a

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:30.050 
sometimes it's off to the edge just a

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:32.230 
sometimes it's off to the edge just a
little<00:01:30.320> bit<00:01:30.530> you<00:01:31.460> if<00:01:31.700> you<00:01:31.790> take<00:01:31.970> enough<00:01:32.210> time

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.240 
little bit you if you take enough time

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.660 
little bit you if you take enough time
can<00:01:33.229> probably<00:01:33.619> get<00:01:33.979> that<00:01:34.130> evened<00:01:34.550> out

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:34.670 
can probably get that evened out

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:36.700 
can probably get that evened out
sometimes<00:01:35.390> you<00:01:35.540> just<00:01:35.630> can't<00:01:36.050> there's<00:01:36.470> a<00:01:36.560> lot

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:36.710 
sometimes you just can't there's a lot

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:42.010 
sometimes you just can't there's a lot
of<00:01:36.860> bulk<00:01:37.070> there<00:01:38.140> again<00:01:39.140> a<00:01:39.170> trade<00:01:39.530> off<00:01:39.740> so<00:01:41.020> just

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:42.020 
of bulk there again a trade off so just

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.310 
of bulk there again a trade off so just
keep<00:01:42.200> that<00:01:42.229> in<00:01:42.410> mind

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:44.320 
keep that in mind

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.320 
keep that in mind
