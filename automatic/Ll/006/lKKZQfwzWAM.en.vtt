00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.140 
covered inside and out with bacteria and
microbes<00:00:16.560> we're<00:00:16.800> actually<00:00:16.949> this<00:00:17.730> sort<00:00:18.060> of

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
microbes we're actually this sort of

microbes we're actually this sort of
entire<00:00:18.750> ecosystem<00:00:19.710> like<00:00:19.980> a<00:00:20.039> walking<00:00:20.550> hive

actually<00:00:22.470> it<00:00:22.920> grosses<00:00:23.310> me<00:00:23.340> out<00:00:23.460> but<00:00:23.850> all<00:00:24.029> of

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
actually it grosses me out but all of

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.240 
actually it grosses me out but all of
these<00:00:24.240> microbes<00:00:24.810> serve<00:00:25.380> important<00:00:25.830> purposes

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
you it's it's a major part of us we've

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.380 
you it's it's a major part of us we've
got<00:00:42.960> ten<00:00:43.290> times<00:00:43.590> more<00:00:43.860> bacteria<00:00:44.489> in<00:00:44.700> our<00:00:45.059> guts

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
got ten times more bacteria in our guts

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.479 
got ten times more bacteria in our guts
and<00:00:45.600> on<00:00:45.690> our<00:00:45.870> bodies<00:00:46.260> than<00:00:46.410> we<00:00:46.559> do<00:00:46.739> actual

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
and on our bodies than we do actual

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.880 
and on our bodies than we do actual
cells<00:00:48.000> we've<00:00:48.570> got<00:00:48.719> two<00:00:48.960> to<00:00:49.079> five<00:00:49.260> pounds<00:00:49.829> of

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890

the<00:00:50.010> stuff<00:00:50.039> on<00:00:50.670> us<00:00:50.730> and<00:00:51.300> in<00:00:51.360> us<00:00:51.539> at<00:00:51.840> any<00:00:52.170> given

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
the stuff on us and in us at any given

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.720 
the stuff on us and in us at any given
moment<00:00:52.649> and<00:00:52.890> here's<00:00:53.100> what's<00:00:53.309> really<00:00:53.370> nuts

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
moment and here's what's really nuts

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.549 
moment and here's what's really nuts
because<00:00:54.059> it's<00:00:54.329> bacteria<00:00:54.870> because<00:00:55.410> it's

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
because it's bacteria because it's

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.369 
because it's bacteria because it's
living<00:00:55.949> and<00:00:56.070> changing<00:00:56.910> it<00:00:57.180> causes<00:00:57.840> changes<00:00:58.320> in

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
living and changing it causes changes in

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.020 
living and changing it causes changes in
us<00:00:58.710> for<00:00:59.039> instance<00:00:59.370> I've<00:00:59.579> been<00:00:59.850> a<00:00:59.879> vegetarian

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
us for instance I've been a vegetarian

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.939 
us for instance I've been a vegetarian
for<00:01:00.600> a<00:01:00.660> few<00:01:00.840> years<00:01:01.050> so<00:01:01.230> the<00:01:01.350> bacteria<00:01:01.890> that

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
for a few years so the bacteria that

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.399 
for a few years so the bacteria that
digest<00:01:02.489> meat<00:01:02.789> has<00:01:03.270> all<00:01:03.480> but<00:01:03.660> died<00:01:03.930> out<00:01:04.140> in<00:01:04.170> my

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
digest meat has all but died out in my

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.770 
digest meat has all but died out in my
gut<00:01:04.739> but<00:01:05.100> just<00:01:05.309> like<00:01:05.460> any<00:01:05.670> other<00:01:05.850> bacteria<00:01:06.540> I

can get it from other people we're

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:10.880 
can get it from other people we're
