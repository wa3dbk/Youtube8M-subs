86 87 here's 84 diving in atc reflexes
so<00:00:46.559> the<00:00:46.680> potentials<00:00:47.219> i'm<00:00:47.280> actually<00:00:47.430> telling

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
so the potentials i'm actually telling

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.850 
so the potentials i'm actually telling
you<00:00:47.850> they<00:00:48.149> can<00:00:48.360> that<00:00:48.960> the<00:00:49.140> place<00:00:49.350> can<00:00:49.530> actually

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
you they can that the place can actually

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.860 
you they can that the place can actually
get<00:00:50.129> past<00:00:50.399> those<00:00:50.579> potentials<00:00:51.120> so<00:00:51.719> for

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
get past those potentials so for

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.260 
get past those potentials so for
instance<00:00:51.949> Chesney<00:00:52.949> can<00:00:53.160> get<00:00:53.309> to<00:00:53.430> 86<00:00:53.969> you<00:00:54.090> can

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
instance Chesney can get to 86 you can

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.900 
instance Chesney can get to 86 you can
game<00:00:54.449> to<00:00:54.570> 87<00:00:55.170> 88<00:00:55.440> quite<00:00:56.129> easily<00:00:56.280> if<00:00:56.489> they<00:00:56.699> play

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
game to 87 88 quite easily if they play

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.610 
game to 87 88 quite easily if they play
wall<00:00:57.149> and<00:00:57.390> you<00:00:57.780> do<00:00:57.899> feature<00:00:58.109> them<00:00:58.379> in<00:00:58.500> your
