some<00:00:15.089> gesture<00:00:15.990> control<00:00:16.410> and<00:00:17.070> we<00:00:17.220> can<00:00:17.400> add<00:00:17.609> the

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
some gesture control and we can add the

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.939 
some gesture control and we can add the
pinch<00:00:18.150> gesture<00:00:18.690> so<00:00:19.320> that<00:00:19.470> the<00:00:19.590> user<00:00:19.619> can

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
pinch gesture so that the user can

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.189 
pinch gesture so that the user can
simply<00:00:20.430> pinch<00:00:20.699> the<00:00:20.880> display<00:00:21.300> to<00:00:21.779> open<00:00:22.109> the

simply pinch the display to open the
flip<00:00:22.410> side<00:00:22.439> view<00:00:22.920> now<00:00:23.640> remember<00:00:23.939> we<00:00:24.600> can<00:00:24.779> use<00:00:24.930> a

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
flip side view now remember we can use a

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.859 
flip side view now remember we can use a
subclass<00:00:25.529> of<00:00:25.769> UI<00:00:25.830> gesture<00:00:26.670> recognizer<00:00:27.269> in

subclass of UI gesture recognizer in

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.410 
subclass of UI gesture recognizer in
this<00:00:27.960> case<00:00:28.230> you<00:00:28.740> I<00:00:28.769> pinch<00:00:29.310> gesture<00:00:29.849> recognizer

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
this case you I pinch gesture recognizer

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.510 
this case you I pinch gesture recognizer
which<00:00:31.080> looks<00:00:31.410> for<00:00:31.650> pinching<00:00:32.040> gestures

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
which looks for pinching gestures

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.330 
which looks for pinching gestures
involving<00:00:33.030> two<00:00:33.239> touches<00:00:33.800> normally<00:00:34.800> when<00:00:35.219> the

involving two touches normally when the
user<00:00:35.579> moves<00:00:35.969> the<00:00:36.360> two<00:00:36.570> fingers<00:00:37.020> toward<00:00:37.469> each

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
user moves the two fingers toward each

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.459 
user moves the two fingers toward each
other<00:00:37.860> it<00:00:38.190> means<00:00:38.489> zoom<00:00:38.969> out<00:00:39.149> and<00:00:39.510> away<00:00:39.960> from

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
other it means zoom out and away from

other it means zoom out and away from
each<00:00:40.590> other<00:00:40.739> means<00:00:41.070> zoom<00:00:41.399> in<00:00:41.610> but<00:00:42.090> in<00:00:42.180> this

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
each other means zoom in but in this

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.690 
each other means zoom in but in this
case<00:00:42.570> I'm<00:00:42.870> simply<00:00:43.290> using<00:00:43.590> a<00:00:43.680> pinch<00:00:44.040> to<00:00:44.489> open

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
case I'm simply using a pinch to open

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:42.430 
have our handle pinch gesture method

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:45.810 
have our handle pinch gesture method
here<00:03:43.330> so<00:03:44.260> if<00:03:44.410> the<00:03:44.530> scale<00:03:44.650> factor<00:03:45.010> relative<00:03:45.700> to

here so if the scale factor relative to

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:47.490 
here so if the scale factor relative to
the<00:03:45.940> points<00:03:46.270> of<00:03:46.330> the<00:03:46.480> two<00:03:46.630> touches<00:03:46.930> in<00:03:47.230> the

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:47.500 
the points of the two touches in the

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:49.290 
the points of the two touches in the
screen<00:03:47.800> coordinates<00:03:48.100> for<00:03:48.610> the<00:03:48.670> pinch<00:03:48.910> gesture

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:49.300 
screen coordinates for the pinch gesture

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:51.930 
screen coordinates for the pinch gesture
is<00:03:49.450> greater<00:03:50.020> than<00:03:50.200> 1<00:03:50.440> code<00:03:51.070> performs<00:03:51.610> the<00:03:51.730> show

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:51.940 
is greater than 1 code performs the show

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:54.510 
is greater than 1 code performs the show
info<00:03:52.360> and<00:03:52.570> that<00:03:52.900> shows<00:03:53.290> the<00:03:53.710> flip<00:03:53.980> side<00:03:54.010> view

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:54.520 
info and that shows the flip side view

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:57.390 
info and that shows the flip side view
so<00:03:55.510> now<00:03:55.690> we<00:03:55.750> have<00:03:55.900> two<00:03:56.080> ways<00:03:56.620> to<00:03:56.650> show<00:03:57.010> the<00:03:57.190> flip

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:57.400 
so now we have two ways to show the flip

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.460 
so now we have two ways to show the flip
side<00:03:57.430> view<00:03:57.940> from<00:03:58.150> the<00:03:58.270> main<00:03:58.450> view<00:03:58.720> we<00:03:59.260> have<00:03:59.440> a

00:03:59.460 --> 00:03:59.470 
side view from the main view we have a

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:02.340 
side view from the main view we have a
pinch<00:03:59.830> gesture<00:04:00.400> or<00:04:00.550> a<00:04:01.060> tap<00:04:01.450> on<00:04:01.630> the<00:04:01.690> light<00:04:01.960> info

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:02.350 
pinch gesture or a tap on the light info

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:04.740 
pinch gesture or a tap on the light info
button<00:04:02.680> coming<00:04:03.670> up<00:04:03.790> we'll<00:04:04.060> be<00:04:04.180> connecting<00:04:04.480> the

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:04.750 
button coming up we'll be connecting the

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:06.780 
button coming up we'll be connecting the
interface<00:04:05.200> objects<00:04:05.770> in<00:04:05.950> the<00:04:06.070> flip<00:04:06.310> side<00:04:06.340> view

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:06.790 
interface objects in the flip side view

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:08.880 
interface objects in the flip side view
to<00:04:07.150> the<00:04:07.180> code<00:04:07.510> using<00:04:07.930> interface<00:04:08.290> builder<00:04:08.620> and

to the code using interface builder and

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:10.830 
to the code using interface builder and
then<00:04:09.310> we'll<00:04:09.430> be<00:04:09.550> testing<00:04:10.030> the<00:04:10.180> app<00:04:10.210> to<00:04:10.330> see<00:04:10.660> how

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:10.840 
then we'll be testing the app to see how

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:13.260 
then we'll be testing the app to see how
this<00:04:11.080> pinch<00:04:11.530> works<00:04:11.920> and<00:04:12.220> how<00:04:12.460> the<00:04:12.520> I<00:04:12.850> button

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:13.270 
this pinch works and how the I button

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:16.710 
this pinch works and how the I button
the<00:04:13.660> light<00:04:13.870> info<00:04:14.230> button<00:04:14.500> works
