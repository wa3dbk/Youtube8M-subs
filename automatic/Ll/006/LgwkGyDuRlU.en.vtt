you're doing it make sure that the
bronzer<00:00:38.399> is<00:00:38.550> actually<00:00:39.149> like<00:00:39.360> two<00:00:39.660> three<00:00:40.020> tones

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.970 
bronzer is actually like two three tones
darker<00:00:40.940> than<00:00:41.940> the<00:00:42.120> skin<00:00:42.450> because<00:00:43.170> if<00:00:43.440> will<00:00:43.770> be

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
if it would be more dark it will be

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:48.740 
if it would be more dark it will be
really<00:00:47.550> bad<00:00:47.700> because<00:00:47.879> you<00:00:48.090> will<00:00:48.239> build<00:00:48.450> it<00:00:48.629> up

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:25.460 
so the right comments that oh my god you
might<00:02:23.280> hate<00:02:23.489> totally<00:02:24.030> orange<00:02:24.390> or<00:02:24.629> stuff<00:02:25.439> like

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
might hate totally orange or stuff like

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.440 
might hate totally orange or stuff like
this<00:02:25.890> because<00:02:26.129> this<00:02:26.340> is<00:02:26.610> for<00:02:26.879> you<00:02:27.000> that<00:02:27.269> you

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
this because this is for you that you

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.920 
this because this is for you that you
definitely<00:02:27.750> see<00:02:28.560> how<00:02:29.000> contours<00:02:30.000> go<00:02:30.299> but<00:02:30.629> the

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
definitely see how contours go but the

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:32.690 
definitely see how contours go but the
only<00:02:31.079> thing<00:02:31.409> you<00:02:31.439> need<00:02:31.650> to<00:02:31.829> remember<00:02:32.129> is<00:02:32.430> just

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
only thing you need to remember is just

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.330 
only thing you need to remember is just
blend<00:02:33.030> blend<00:02:33.480> blend<00:02:33.599> so<00:02:34.530> you<00:02:34.590> see<00:02:34.950> how<00:02:35.159> this

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
blend blend blend so you see how this

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.849 
blend blend blend so you see how this
site<00:02:35.700> now<00:02:35.970> looks<00:02:36.269> totally<00:02:36.810> different<00:02:38.000> but

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:39.859 
site now looks totally different but

00:02:39.859 --> 00:02:42.740 
site now looks totally different but
when<00:02:40.859> I<00:02:40.890> turn<00:02:41.250> her<00:02:41.549> key<00:02:41.819> when<00:02:42.180> you<00:02:42.299> turn<00:02:42.540> her

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
when I turn her key when you turn her

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.369 
when I turn her key when you turn her
like<00:02:42.989> this<00:02:43.170> and<00:02:43.440> she<00:02:43.799> has<00:02:44.180> hair<00:02:45.180> up<00:02:45.450> I<00:02:45.780> think

00:02:46.369 --> 00:02:46.379 
like this and she has hair up I think

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:50.539 
like this and she has hair up I think
this<00:02:47.000> looks<00:02:48.000> quite<00:02:48.329> unnatural<00:02:48.780> yeah<00:02:49.319> so<00:02:50.190> the

00:02:50.539 --> 00:02:50.549 
this looks quite unnatural yeah so the

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:53.059 
this looks quite unnatural yeah so the
main<00:02:50.819> point<00:02:51.209> about<00:02:51.450> this<00:02:51.870> makeup<00:02:52.200> is<00:02:52.590> that<00:02:52.920> you

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:53.069 
main point about this makeup is that you

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:55.940 
main point about this makeup is that you
actually<00:02:53.220> wear<00:02:53.760> your<00:02:53.970> hair<00:02:54.239> down<00:02:54.530> so<00:02:55.530> you

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
actually wear your hair down so you

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.569 
actually wear your hair down so you
wouldn't<00:02:56.310> see<00:02:56.579> this<00:02:56.819> part<00:02:57.209> and<00:02:57.540> I<00:02:57.599> think

00:02:58.569 --> 00:02:58.579 
wouldn't see this part and I think

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:02.210 
wouldn't see this part and I think
otherwise<00:02:59.579> this<00:02:59.909> needs<00:03:00.450> to<00:03:00.629> be<00:03:00.810> a<00:03:01.200> very<00:03:01.769> very

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
otherwise this needs to be a very very

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.399 
otherwise this needs to be a very very
lighter<00:03:02.670> application<00:03:03.060> than<00:03:03.930> this<00:03:04.109> one

00:03:04.399 --> 00:03:04.409 
lighter application than this one

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:07.399 
lighter application than this one
because<00:03:04.730> it<00:03:05.730> looks<00:03:05.760> awkward<00:03:06.209> if<00:03:06.720> you<00:03:06.840> darky

00:03:07.399 --> 00:03:07.409 
because it looks awkward if you darky

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:09.710 
because it looks awkward if you darky
that's<00:03:07.859> what<00:03:08.159> Kim<00:03:08.400> Kardashian<00:03:09.060> contouring

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
that's what Kim Kardashian contouring

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.080 
that's what Kim Kardashian contouring
highlighting<00:03:10.139> doesn't<00:03:11.010> work<00:03:11.159> yeah<00:03:11.459> because

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
highlighting doesn't work yeah because

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:13.879 
highlighting doesn't work yeah because
if<00:03:12.299> you<00:03:12.450> think<00:03:12.659> about<00:03:12.870> it<00:03:13.290> she's<00:03:13.560> always

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:13.889 
if you think about it she's always

00:03:13.889 --> 00:03:16.670 
if you think about it she's always
turned<00:03:14.370> in<00:03:14.579> a<00:03:14.669> same<00:03:14.970> direction<00:03:15.449> when<00:03:15.959> they

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
turned in a same direction when they

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.309 
turned in a same direction when they
take<00:03:16.949> her<00:03:17.220> pictures<00:03:17.819> and<00:03:18.150> they<00:03:18.810> think<00:03:19.109> that

00:03:19.309 --> 00:03:19.319 
take her pictures and they think that

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:23.240 
take her pictures and they think that
her<00:03:19.590> photo<00:03:19.919> she's<00:03:20.370> always<00:03:20.579> just<00:03:22.250> pictured

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
her photo she's always just pictured

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.729 
her photo she's always just pictured
from<00:03:23.489> the<00:03:23.639> front<00:03:24.019> because<00:03:25.019> if<00:03:25.169> she<00:03:25.379> would<00:03:25.500> turn

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:25.739 
from the front because if she would turn

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:27.470 
from the front because if she would turn
her<00:03:25.799> head<00:03:26.250> like<00:03:26.459> this<00:03:26.639> she<00:03:26.909> would<00:03:27.060> be<00:03:27.239> just

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
her head like this she would be just

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:30.949 
her head like this she would be just
dark<00:03:27.840> everywhere<00:03:29.120> yeah<00:03:30.120> just<00:03:30.389> remember<00:03:30.599> I'm

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 
dark everywhere yeah just remember I'm

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:33.559 
dark everywhere yeah just remember I'm
applying<00:03:31.260> it<00:03:31.590> far<00:03:31.859> fast<00:03:32.609> longer<00:03:33.180> that<00:03:33.389> you

00:03:33.559 --> 00:03:33.569 
applying it far fast longer that you

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:36.530 
applying it far fast longer that you
don't<00:03:33.750> really<00:03:33.989> see<00:03:34.109> what<00:03:34.590> I'm<00:03:34.769> doing<00:03:35.069> and<00:03:35.540> I'm

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
don't really see what I'm doing and I'm

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.689 
don't really see what I'm doing and I'm
pulling<00:03:37.230> it<00:03:37.349> towards<00:03:37.799> her<00:03:38.010> nose<00:03:38.220> because

00:03:38.689 --> 00:03:38.699 
pulling it towards her nose because

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:41.059 
pulling it towards her nose because
otherwise<00:03:39.000> I<00:03:39.150> would<00:03:39.389> prolong<00:03:39.870> guide<00:03:40.260> her<00:03:40.650> her

00:03:41.059 --> 00:03:41.069 
otherwise I would prolong guide her her

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:42.949 
otherwise I would prolong guide her her
chin<00:03:41.400> is<00:03:41.639> she<00:03:41.790> already<00:03:42.000> has<00:03:42.329> a<00:03:42.359> bit<00:03:42.629> smaller

chin is she already has a bit smaller

chin is she already has a bit smaller
chin<00:03:43.349> and<00:03:43.560> I<00:03:44.069> would<00:03:44.310> pull<00:03:44.639> it<00:03:44.819> down<00:03:45.030> which<00:03:45.269> I

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:45.419 
chin and I would pull it down which I

00:03:45.419 --> 00:03:47.780 
chin and I would pull it down which I
don't<00:03:45.629> want<00:03:45.780> to<00:03:45.870> do<00:03:46.019> and<00:03:46.290> now<00:03:46.979> if<00:03:47.159> I<00:03:47.340> would<00:03:47.519> pull

don't want to do and now if I would pull

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:49.670 
don't want to do and now if I would pull
this<00:03:47.940> contour<00:03:48.419> Stoics<00:03:48.840> come<00:03:49.139> out<00:03:49.319> then<00:03:49.620> it

this contour Stoics come out then it

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.009 
this contour Stoics come out then it
would<00:03:49.889> be<00:03:50.010> too<00:03:50.220> glamorous<00:03:50.459> and<00:03:50.970> just<00:03:51.479> I<00:03:51.690> would
