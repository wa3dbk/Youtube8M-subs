only problem with it is that it's not

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:14.640 
only problem with it is that it's not
like<00:05:12.610> other<00:05:12.790> eyeliner<00:05:13.270> you<00:05:13.900> have<00:05:14.020> to<00:05:14.200> use<00:05:14.380> a

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:14.650 
like other eyeliner you have to use a

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:22.620 
like other eyeliner you have to use a
wider<00:05:15.270> so<00:05:18.300> put<00:05:19.300> it<00:05:19.390> under<00:05:19.720> and<00:05:20.080> then<00:05:21.540> you<00:05:22.540> have

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:22.630 
wider so put it under and then you have

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:25.410 
wider so put it under and then you have
to<00:05:22.810> blow<00:05:23.110> so<00:05:23.890> because<00:05:24.460> when<00:05:24.640> it's<00:05:24.820> hot<00:05:25.030> it'll

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:25.420 
to blow so because when it's hot it'll

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:27.330 
to blow so because when it's hot it'll
just<00:05:25.450> squish<00:05:25.900> down<00:05:26.200> and<00:05:26.530> it<00:05:26.710> will<00:05:27.040> become<00:05:27.310> a

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:27.340 
just squish down and it will become a

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:36.300 
just squish down and it will become a
mess<00:05:33.570> and<00:05:34.570> then<00:05:35.110> when<00:05:35.260> you<00:05:35.380> feel<00:05:35.650> that<00:05:36.130> it's

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:36.310 
mess and then when you feel that it's

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:38.940 
mess and then when you feel that it's
ready<00:05:36.580> take<00:05:37.300> your<00:05:37.330> finger<00:05:37.840> and<00:05:37.870> lightly<00:05:38.500> dab

ready take your finger and lightly dab

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:40.770 
ready take your finger and lightly dab
it<00:05:39.160> because<00:05:39.520> you're<00:05:39.700> never<00:05:39.850> sure<00:05:40.270> if<00:05:40.480> it's

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:40.780 
it because you're never sure if it's

00:05:40.780 --> 00:06:03.779 
it because you're never sure if it's
still<00:05:41.050> hot<00:05:41.290> and<00:05:41.670> so<00:05:42.670> it's<00:05:42.880> good<00:05:43.030> to<00:05:43.060> go

00:06:03.779 --> 00:06:03.789
