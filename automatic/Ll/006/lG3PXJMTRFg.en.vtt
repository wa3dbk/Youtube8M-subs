pucks from it the pucks are pretty much
a<00:00:24.300> non-factor<00:00:25.080> though<00:00:25.199> I<00:00:25.920> play<00:00:26.400> hot<00:00:26.550> every<00:00:26.760> day

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
a non-factor though I play hot every day

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
the 1200 epochs so we don't need the

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.139 
the 1200 epochs so we don't need the
punch<00:00:31.109> from<00:00:31.349> playing<00:00:31.590> the<00:00:31.710> MVC<00:00:32.430> matchup<00:00:32.969> so
