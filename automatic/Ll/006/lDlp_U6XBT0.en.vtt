00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
so far so am personally I think the two

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.630 
so far so am personally I think the two
screenshots<00:01:13.170> that<00:01:13.590> were<00:01:13.799> originally<00:01:14.220> given

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
screenshots that were originally given

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.560 
screenshots that were originally given
out<00:01:14.880> looked<00:01:15.810> a<00:01:16.020> lot<00:01:16.229> like<00:01:16.290> halo<00:01:16.860> and<00:01:17.420> then<00:01:18.420> we

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
out looked a lot like halo and then we

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.310 
out looked a lot like halo and then we
saw<00:01:18.720> the<00:01:18.780> trailer<00:01:19.080> and<00:01:19.549> it<00:01:20.549> looked<00:01:20.790> like<00:01:20.909> halo

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:21.320 
saw the trailer and it looked like halo

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.510
