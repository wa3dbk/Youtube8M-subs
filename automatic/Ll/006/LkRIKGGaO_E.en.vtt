00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:06.390

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:12.240

 either is not a game handle 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.450
 but good is so that it bores us and 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:22.810
 neither is it worth 

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:26.050
 Many ask me how can I have the 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:28.480
 pirated playstation3 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:30.310
 what is good rather also that it is a 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:33.579
 precision trans pirated many me 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:36.879
 they say it's the cw i need to have the cw 

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:39.550
 to have the pirate play3 soon 

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:41.920
 you have the play in dex such a vale 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:43.590
 I'm going to explain what is each thing and 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:46.080
 how does it work 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:51.690
 to see the first one once and they are 3 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:54.420
 pirated voucher is the pse the double cfv 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:57.290
 to say all that many is to say for 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.430
 have the pirate play3 needed the cfw 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:02.790
 cfw 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:05.610
 to see the decision is clear three 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:08.460
 pirates is the being w itself 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:11.190
 all playstation and all when 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:15.110
 all purchases have the fw that 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:17.660
 means official firmware that 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:21.350
 like me that is windows 7 windows 8 a 

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:24.750
 official harassment the cw means custom 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:27.080
 firmware is customized 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:30.660
 that we have treated him a little bit to 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:33.780
 put them almost all this well then what 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:38.820
 what we do is replace the fw 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:41.850
 by the cfw to then it is no longer an ace 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.830
 3 ordinal dress pirate and then 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.290
 yes for in the pirated movie 3 ago 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:49.080
 the double cfv is missing 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:53.220
 ok we have to do to have the 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:54.930
 accuracy 3 pirated is worth a lot 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.290
 while updates are coming out 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:02.370
 the application 3 is all the time 4.30 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:04.230
 4.31 So it's worth if we have any 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:06.180
 Playstation 3 

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:10.040
 I know second hand in a store 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:13.890
 or saved wherever we go to here 

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:16.319
 look or show it already 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:20.870
 well you can not good in settings of 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:24.319
 system we go to system information 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:27.409
 and we will get the update in which 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:28.770
 we are at the point whatever 4 point 

00:02:27.409 --> 00:02:35.460
 whatever is 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:38.570
 if we are 3.55 or lower 3.54 

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:41.370
 3.53 is whichever is lower than that 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:43.940
 we can put the double cfv that is 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:48.000
 we can hack our playstation 3 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:51.240
 which is above that number 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.700
 it would not be so easy to hack the 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:56.400
 we would need to create it what 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:58.380
 means that download the version of 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.890
 our playstation 3 that you can 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:05.900
 make you 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:10.490
 you could but it's not like I could not 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:14.370
 go because you need apart from material 

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:16.740
 knowledge about this if you do not know if 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:18.950
 know how to manage a good with this from the 

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:18.950
 play 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:23.170
 to see what is c's and what is it 

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:27.160
 the sex 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:29.709
 it's worth cx sex all the precision three 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:31.630
 they are in sex with which I am playing 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:35.470
 right now with which you play with what 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:39.220
 what is your cousin your brother essex 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:42.850
 ok when a play is in dex is what 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:46.180
 rtm or rts real time modding or real 

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:48.210
 time editing which is what we do with 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:53.110
 what I do and many friends of mine do 

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:55.240
 as an example the soft said such that the van 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:58.030
 editing that is to say in a pot they put 

00:03:55.240 --> 00:04:01.120
 the modern warfare 3 and suddenly it 's 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:03.130
 pump changes the name or changes the 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:06.250
 prestige markers can change 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:08.920
 everything is real-time editing can is 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:10.360
 What C's do is that you can 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:13.090
 Edit 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:15.850
 what you play itself you can edit the 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:19.000
 game at the same time you play if 

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:21.100
 they were sex a pyre as sexy as me 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.650
 I've taught a lot of hack menus and stuff 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:26.320
 you're worth it, we can do it with a 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:27.430
 sex perfectly but with the adex what 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:29.830
 what can I do for example right now 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:32.230
 I'm playing and I'm immortal because 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:34.150
 If I changed the color of the weapon I do it 

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:36.360
 at the same time that game is not a thing 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:40.480
 that I prepare before I start playing 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:41.980
 for example, I prepare the menu worth 

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:43.660
 I have prepared the menu before 

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:46.419
 enter the game I enter and I get the 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:48.910
 menu not here I'm playing normal without 

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:50.860
 hack or anything and suddenly I want a menu 

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:54.730
 Well, I put it on because, because I 

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:57.250
 edited I make it come out okay that's 

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:59.639
 the text that you can edit the same to 

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:02.340
 same time we play 

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:03.930
 and nothing I think that until here I have finished 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:07.379
 all 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:09.360
 If you have any doubt or curiosity or 

00:05:07.379 --> 00:05:13.020
