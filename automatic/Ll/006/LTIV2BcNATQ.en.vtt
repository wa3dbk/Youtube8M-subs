bit of pressure okay

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.650 
bit of pressure okay

voila<00:02:19.260> okay<00:02:19.590> and<00:02:19.830> then<00:02:19.950> this<00:02:20.130> is<00:02:20.190> probably<00:02:20.490> the

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
voila okay and then this is probably the

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.630 
voila okay and then this is probably the
most<00:02:21.140> difficult<00:02:22.140> part<00:02:22.350> of<00:02:22.470> the<00:02:22.590> whole<00:02:22.640> project

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
most difficult part of the whole project

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.060 
most difficult part of the whole project
and<00:02:24.210> that's<00:02:24.420> where<00:02:24.660> you<00:02:24.750> take<00:02:24.930> a<00:02:25.140> one<00:02:25.410> inch<00:02:25.680> by

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.070 
and that's where you take a one inch by

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:28.310 
and that's where you take a one inch by
two<00:02:26.130> inch<00:02:26.430> piece<00:02:26.940> of<00:02:27.120> scratch<00:02:27.360> paper<00:02:27.390> and<00:02:27.810> line

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:33.260 
up the corners to the edge of the heart
and<00:02:31.050> to<00:02:31.770> the<00:02:31.800> dot<00:02:32.100> over<00:02:32.340> here<00:02:32.460> okay<00:02:33.150> and

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
and to the dot over here okay and

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:35.720 
and to the dot over here okay and
literally<00:02:33.750> just<00:02:33.780> trace<00:02:34.680> on<00:02:35.010> the<00:02:35.250> outside

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
literally just trace on the outside

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:40.640 
literally just trace on the outside
three<00:02:36.030> edges<00:02:36.450> and<00:02:37.070> then<00:02:38.090> score<00:02:39.090> on<00:02:39.420> the<00:02:40.230> inside

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
three edges and then score on the inside

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.880 
three edges and then score on the inside
edge<00:02:40.890> okay<00:02:41.790> and<00:02:42.210> you<00:02:43.170> do<00:02:43.320> that<00:02:43.470> on<00:02:43.620> both<00:02:43.830> sides

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
edge okay and you do that on both sides

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.310 
edge okay and you do that on both sides
which<00:02:44.400> we<00:02:44.640> want<00:02:44.910> we<00:02:45.240> will<00:02:45.420> through<00:02:46.230> the

a<00:04:38.699> little<00:04:39.000> bit<00:04:39.060> of<00:04:39.180> static<00:04:39.570> I<00:04:39.780> guess<00:04:40.020> probably

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:40.440 
a little bit of static I guess probably

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:43.700 
a little bit of static I guess probably
all<00:04:40.919> my<00:04:41.070> energy<00:04:41.250> today<00:04:41.870> so<00:04:42.870> there<00:04:43.110> you<00:04:43.259> go<00:04:43.410> and

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:43.710 
all my energy today so there you go and

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:44.930 
all my energy today so there you go and
obviously<00:04:44.130> I<00:04:44.160> don't<00:04:44.250> need<00:04:44.460> that<00:04:44.610> much<00:04:44.729> so<00:04:44.910> I

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:44.940 
obviously I don't need that much so I

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:46.490 
obviously I don't need that much so I
would<00:04:45.060> take<00:04:45.300> and<00:04:45.509> pull<00:04:45.660> it<00:04:45.780> down<00:04:45.930> and<00:04:46.080> trim<00:04:46.320> it

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:46.500 
would take and pull it down and trim it

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:48.860 
would take and pull it down and trim it
huh<00:04:46.889> but<00:04:47.520> it's<00:04:47.669> a<00:04:47.820> little<00:04:48.060> bland<00:04:48.389> don't<00:04:48.750> you
