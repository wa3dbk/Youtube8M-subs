00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:06.750
 it's okay, but you speak, it's max now. 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.150
 after you have created some of the 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.280
 scenery lighting our game let's 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:14.250
 now go to the creation part 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.170
 here camera ok camera creation in 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.420
 first person to start now so 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.910
 a little more complicated, but I 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.439
 I'll try to at least teach you 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.810
 I was also touring 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.730
 first the camera is not and add 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.500
 also the object you want in the case 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.019
 that move to be your character 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.880
 can be even a fashion modeling of the 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:36.000
 your character if you have né 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:40.530
 add a camera mark the 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.540
 option to move on the axis is that the 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.780
 axis x né I think that this same 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:48.629
 puts in 90 that she stays straight year and 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:52.199
 chukchis ok now it's only you are fine 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:54.239
 positioned it according to this scenario 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.949
 I started the game here. 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.680
 have in the case can be a character 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:01.980
 with the same plan for anything that 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.030
 you want it to interact in the case 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.729
 with the Senate, right? 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.470
 After you did it, beauty, okay? 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.659
 Okay, okay, let's wait. 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.340
 then add the property is in the 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.960
 my case the issue do otherwise 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.880
 do it here but you will 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.130
 tell me why I was wrong to do 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.080
 you first select Camera and 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.900
 then press the object you want 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.520
 personnel against the tire in case your 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.049
 relative of one another 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.360
 if you make a way that I did 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:29.250
 first access the object after the camera 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.930
 can have a bull first step to the 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.210
 otherwise I'll be in bed and then 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.670
 object you will know why it is now 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.650
 now that we are going to position her that does not 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.500
 I know nothing in our game to be well. 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:43.590
 cool cool or shrink size 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.810

 game is ok 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.689
 then he would have done it positioned in 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:56.090
 your scenario your game let's get to 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:59.070

 add camera movement 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.450
 remembering if you want to give access to 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.430
 the first camera selection and will in 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:29.760
 April script is what is going to be 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:31.709
 grant sees on the screen that it is a case 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.650
 national camera movement same 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:37.050
 after they have done this they will only be 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.040
 camera comes here again and 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:40.500
 Mouse 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.510
 now add and add this one 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.400
 command that the latter this father thomé think 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:47.880
 that's the name, and here in the mouse 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:49.950
 You leave movement and and here in this 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.880
 father then you put the script that you 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.680
 do you want 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:55.650
 and now think 0 and enter the 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:57.030
 camera is seeing that in my case until the 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:59.340
 moment only forever because 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:00.870
 first wrong that time there as already 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:03.630
 I had explained to you, right? 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:06.630
 the correct you first do not select 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:08.250
 in case the camera and then you do it 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:09.420
 with us now you will do this part 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:11.160
 here o 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.989
 first to undo this here 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:15.390
 I think the only way by removing the same 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:18.060
 It's a problem, we did it again. 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:19.830
 first touch 6 on the camera after the 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.780
 personal object against pm goes to 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:23.549
 first option now has 60 in the 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:25.799
 game that as you can see is 

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:27.150
 moving the camera forever below the 

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:30.450
 point as if it were the first sight 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:30.840
 Okay, the person is not that difficult, and that's it. 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:33.450
 there 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:35.670
 now if we signed the view 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:36.900
 first person in our game I hope that 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:38.700
