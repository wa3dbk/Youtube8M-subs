uh we had this argument all the time he
loved<00:00:35.860> serrations<00:00:36.399> it's<00:00:36.940> just<00:00:37.090> the<00:00:37.180> best

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:37.360

thing<00:00:37.480> for<00:00:37.600> initiated<00:00:38.469> cut<00:00:38.620> and<00:00:38.800> I<00:00:38.860> think<00:00:39.100> that

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:39.190 
thing for initiated cut and I think that

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:40.290 
thing for initiated cut and I think that
I<00:00:39.219> sharp<00:00:39.550> knife<00:00:39.760> is<00:00:39.880> the<00:00:39.940> best<00:00:40.149> thing<00:00:40.270> to

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:40.300 
I sharp knife is the best thing to

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:41.790 
I sharp knife is the best thing to
initiate<00:00:40.660> cut<00:00:40.870> but<00:00:41.350> I<00:00:41.410> want<00:00:41.530> to<00:00:41.590> get<00:00:41.680> your

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:41.800 
initiate cut but I want to get your

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.650 
initiate cut but I want to get your
perspective<00:00:41.980> on<00:00:42.460> it<00:00:42.520> one<00:00:42.879> thing<00:00:43.149> one

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:43.660 
perspective on it one thing one

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:45.060 
perspective on it one thing one
complaint<00:00:43.989> I<00:00:44.050> do<00:00:44.110> have<00:00:44.350> the<00:00:44.500> serrations<00:00:44.950> that

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:45.070 
complaint I do have the serrations that

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:46.560 
complaint I do have the serrations that
I've<00:00:45.160> only<00:00:45.280> seen<00:00:45.460> a<00:00:45.520> few<00:00:45.610> knives<00:00:46.239> do

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:46.570 
I've only seen a few knives do

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:48.869 
I've only seen a few knives do
serrations<00:00:47.050> right<00:00:47.260> is<00:00:47.920> that<00:00:48.129> this<00:00:48.339> area<00:00:48.670> right

00:00:48.869 --> 00:00:48.879 
serrations right is that this area right

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:52.169 
serrations right is that this area right
here<00:00:48.940> is<00:00:49.300> where<00:00:49.690> you<00:00:49.960> get<00:00:50.050> a<00:00:50.109> lot<00:00:50.410> of<00:00:51.179> control

00:00:52.169 --> 00:00:52.179 
here is where you get a lot of control

00:00:52.179 --> 00:00:53.970 
here is where you get a lot of control
to<00:00:52.690> initiate<00:00:52.809> a<00:00:53.050> cut<00:00:53.260> so<00:00:53.769> you<00:00:53.829> get

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:53.980 
to initiate a cut so you get

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:55.290 
to initiate a cut so you get
accelerations<00:00:54.579> in<00:00:54.699> there<00:00:54.850> if<00:00:54.999> you're<00:00:55.149> doing

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:55.300 
accelerations in there if you're doing

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:56.459 
accelerations in there if you're doing
some<00:00:55.420> kind<00:00:55.539> of<00:00:55.629> carving<00:00:56.019> this<00:00:56.109> is<00:00:56.230> actually

00:00:56.459 --> 00:00:56.469 
some kind of carving this is actually

00:00:56.469 --> 00:00:58.139 
some kind of carving this is actually
the<00:00:56.530> worst<00:00:56.649> place<00:00:56.949> for<00:00:56.980> it<00:00:57.370> and<00:00:57.460> then<00:00:58.059> if

00:00:58.139 --> 00:00:58.149 
the worst place for it and then if

00:00:58.149 --> 00:00:59.849 
the worst place for it and then if
you're<00:00:58.239> using<00:00:58.359> to<00:00:58.510> cut<00:00:58.719> rope<00:00:58.960> you<00:00:59.379> not<00:00:59.530> think

00:00:59.849 --> 00:00:59.859 
you're using to cut rope you not think

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:01.619 
you're using to cut rope you not think
that<00:00:59.920> up<00:01:00.219> here<00:01:00.640> near<00:01:00.940> the<00:01:01.120> belly<00:01:01.300> of<00:01:01.390> the<00:01:01.449> blade

00:01:01.619 --> 00:01:01.629 
that up here near the belly of the blade

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:03.000 
that up here near the belly of the blade
would<00:01:01.749> be<00:01:01.839> a<00:01:01.870> little<00:01:02.019> bit<00:01:02.199> better<00:01:02.350> area<00:01:02.769> for

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:03.010 
would be a little bit better area for

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:04.890 
would be a little bit better area for
serration<00:01:03.429> to<00:01:03.519> be<00:01:03.609> this<00:01:04.300> section<00:01:04.720> right<00:01:04.750> here

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:04.900 
serration to be this section right here

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:07.890 
serration to be this section right here
so<00:01:05.590> I<00:01:05.890> have<00:01:06.100> seen<00:01:06.370> a<00:01:06.670> few<00:01:06.760> blade<00:01:07.479> that<00:01:07.600> actually

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:07.900 
so I have seen a few blade that actually

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:10.410 
so I have seen a few blade that actually
have<00:01:08.050> serrations<00:01:08.670> more<00:01:09.670> near<00:01:09.820> the<00:01:09.940> belly<00:01:10.150> and

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:10.420 
have serrations more near the belly and

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:13.710 
have serrations more near the belly and
back<00:01:10.930> here<00:01:11.229> um<00:01:11.490> but<00:01:12.490> you<00:01:12.880> know<00:01:12.909> we'll<00:01:13.570> see<00:01:13.600> what

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:19.390 
your perspective on it Dule serrations

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:21.690 
your perspective on it Dule serrations
the<00:01:19.930> pro<00:01:20.140> serrations<00:01:20.680> or<00:01:20.829> anti<00:01:21.219> serrations

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:21.700 
the pro serrations or anti serrations

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.490 
the pro serrations or anti serrations
and<00:01:22.119> if<00:01:22.210> you<00:01:22.299> are<00:01:22.420> pro<00:01:22.630> serrations<00:01:23.110> how<00:01:23.350> do<00:01:23.409> you

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:23.500 
and if you are pro serrations how do you

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:24.719 
and if you are pro serrations how do you
how<00:01:23.829> do<00:01:23.890> you<00:01:23.950> sharpen<00:01:24.189> these<00:01:24.399> little<00:01:24.610> guys

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:24.729 
how do you sharpen these little guys

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:27.330 
how do you sharpen these little guys
because<00:01:25.149> I<00:01:25.180> find<00:01:25.689> that<00:01:26.070> serrations<00:01:27.070> in<00:01:27.219> my

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:27.340 
because I find that serrations in my

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:29.670 
because I find that serrations in my
opinion<00:01:27.610> are<00:01:27.820> just<00:01:28.030> a<00:01:28.299> lazy<00:01:29.079> man's<00:01:29.380> sharp

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:29.680 
opinion are just a lazy man's sharp

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:31.080 
opinion are just a lazy man's sharp
knife<00:01:29.860> you<00:01:30.340> don't<00:01:30.490> tell<00:01:30.640> you<00:01:30.729> sharpen<00:01:31.030> your
