somewhat<00:00:54.150> historically<00:00:54.689> accurate<00:00:54.989> a<00:00:55.350> bit

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:55.470 
somewhat historically accurate a bit

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:57.859 
somewhat historically accurate a bit
more<00:00:55.799> so<00:00:56.189> than<00:00:56.820> seen<00:00:57.150> in<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:57.479> very<00:00:57.629> first

00:00:57.859 --> 00:00:57.869

tanks<00:01:02.339> especially<00:01:02.850> when<00:01:03.000> they<00:01:03.390> shouldn't<00:01:03.750> be

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
tanks especially when they shouldn't be

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.050

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
levels although if I'm not mistaken it

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.109 
levels although if I'm not mistaken it
was<00:01:10.229> just<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:10.680> one<00:01:10.860> now<00:01:11.549> this<00:01:11.729> level<00:01:11.909> of

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
was just the one now this level of

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:12.620 
was just the one now this level of
looking<00:01:12.360> at

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
looking at

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.660 
looking at
here<00:01:12.900> it<00:01:13.080> was<00:01:13.260> actually<00:01:13.830> one<00:01:14.040> of<00:01:14.070> my<00:01:14.160> favorites

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
here it was actually one of my favorites

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:15.950 
here it was actually one of my favorites
from<00:01:14.790> the<00:01:15.000> expansion<00:01:15.420> pack<00:01:15.600> you<00:01:15.750> have<00:01:15.780> to

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
from the expansion pack you have to

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.380 
from the expansion pack you have to
fight<00:01:16.140> up<00:01:16.350> this<00:01:16.650> mountain<00:01:16.950> and<00:01:17.400> it<00:01:17.850> is<00:01:18.090> very

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
fight up this mountain and it is very

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.330 
fight up this mountain and it is very
difficult<00:01:18.750> to<00:01:19.080> do<00:01:19.230> so<00:01:19.260> now<00:01:19.950> if<00:01:20.070> you're<00:01:20.220> the

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
difficult to do so now if you're the

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.160 
difficult to do so now if you're the
defender<00:01:20.880> it's<00:01:21.180> pretty<00:01:21.450> easy<00:01:21.660> because<00:01:21.960> you're

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
defender it's pretty easy because you're

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.620 
defender it's pretty easy because you're
gonna<00:01:22.320> jump<00:01:22.710> on<00:01:22.920> a<00:01:22.950> artillery<00:01:23.880> platform<00:01:24.420> and

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
gonna jump on a artillery platform and

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.600 
gonna jump on a artillery platform and
just<00:01:24.750> bomb<00:01:25.050> everybody<00:01:25.380> to<00:01:25.680> hell<00:01:25.860> really

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
just bomb everybody to hell really

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.340 
just bomb everybody to hell really
that's<00:01:27.180> one<00:01:27.360> thing<00:01:27.540> I<00:01:27.659> did<00:01:27.810> not<00:01:27.900> mention<00:01:27.960> in

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
that's one thing I did not mention in

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.530 
that's one thing I did not mention in
the<00:01:28.440> first<00:01:28.470> review<00:01:28.920> the<00:01:29.430> AI<00:01:29.610> for<00:01:29.820> this<00:01:30.090> game<00:01:30.300> is

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
the first review the AI for this game is

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.810 
the first review the AI for this game is
actually<00:01:30.780> pretty<00:01:31.440> good<00:01:31.560> and<00:01:32.100> you<00:01:32.250> can't<00:01:32.520> take

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
actually pretty good and you can't take

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.390 
actually pretty good and you can't take
that<00:01:32.880> many<00:01:33.510> hits<00:01:33.900> in<00:01:34.260> fact<00:01:34.830> you<00:01:34.950> can<00:01:35.100> get<00:01:35.220> shot

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
that many hits in fact you can get shot

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.740 
that many hits in fact you can get shot
about<00:01:35.580> three<00:01:35.820> or<00:01:35.909> four<00:01:36.090> times<00:01:36.330> then<00:01:36.630> you're

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
about three or four times then you're

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:37.310 
about three or four times then you're
dead

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
dead

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.260 
dead
so<00:01:37.650> whenever<00:01:37.830> the<00:01:38.100> enemy<00:01:38.400> sends<00:01:38.790> two<00:01:38.970> or<00:01:39.120> three

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
so whenever the enemy sends two or three

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.610 
so whenever the enemy sends two or three
enemy<00:01:39.540> soldiers<00:01:39.870> after<00:01:40.110> you<00:01:40.200> it's<00:01:40.350> a<00:01:40.409> pretty

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:40.620 
enemy soldiers after you it's a pretty

00:01:40.620 --> 00:02:14.410 
enemy soldiers after you it's a pretty
harrowing<00:01:40.860> experience

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.960 

and<00:02:15.420> really<00:02:16.050> that's<00:02:16.320> about<00:02:16.560> it<00:02:16.890> road<00:02:17.640> to<00:02:17.790> Rome

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
and really that's about it road to Rome

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.810 
and really that's about it road to Rome
was<00:02:18.270> a<00:02:18.300> very<00:02:18.900> very<00:02:19.380> basic<00:02:19.650> expansion<00:02:20.400> pack<00:02:20.580> as

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:20.820 
was a very very basic expansion pack as

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:23.540 
was a very very basic expansion pack as
said<00:02:21.060> earlier<00:02:21.450> you<00:02:22.050> get<00:02:22.230> maybe<00:02:22.590> one<00:02:23.010> or<00:02:23.400> two

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
said earlier you get maybe one or two

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.460 
said earlier you get maybe one or two
new<00:02:23.760> weapons<00:02:24.150> that<00:02:24.300> work<00:02:24.540> exactly<00:02:24.810> like<00:02:25.200> the

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
new weapons that work exactly like the

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.980 
new weapons that work exactly like the
weapons<00:02:25.800> did<00:02:26.040> in<00:02:26.250> the<00:02:26.670> first<00:02:26.910> game<00:02:27.210> you<00:02:27.780> get<00:02:27.960> a

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:27.990 
weapons did in the first game you get a

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:30.380 
weapons did in the first game you get a
few<00:02:28.260> new<00:02:28.410> tanks<00:02:28.920> which<00:02:29.100> work<00:02:29.340> exactly<00:02:30.000> like

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
few new tanks which work exactly like

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.090 
few new tanks which work exactly like
they<00:02:30.570> did<00:02:30.600> in<00:02:30.900> the<00:02:31.020> first<00:02:31.200> game<00:02:31.530> you<00:02:31.710> get<00:02:31.860> a<00:02:31.890> few

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
they did in the first game you get a few

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.160 
they did in the first game you get a few
new<00:02:32.250> maps<00:02:32.520> but<00:02:33.180> they're<00:02:33.630> not<00:02:33.750> that<00:02:33.930> amazing

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
new maps but they're not that amazing

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.830 
new maps but they're not that amazing
really<00:02:35.160> the<00:02:35.400> next<00:02:35.850> expansion<00:02:36.180> pack<00:02:36.570> that<00:02:36.750> were

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
really the next expansion pack that were

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.600 
really the next expansion pack that were
taking<00:02:37.380> a<00:02:37.410> look<00:02:37.560> at<00:02:37.740> in<00:02:37.920> the<00:02:38.040> next<00:02:38.340> video

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
taking a look at in the next video

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.610 
taking a look at in the next video
actually<00:02:39.150> did<00:02:39.360> add<00:02:39.660> a<00:02:39.960> great<00:02:40.350> deal<00:02:40.560> more

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
actually did add a great deal more

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.220 
actually did add a great deal more
content<00:02:41.430> but<00:02:41.970> really<00:02:42.210> for<00:02:42.360> what<00:02:42.510> this<00:02:42.690> is<00:02:42.900> it

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
content but really for what this is it

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:46.130 
content but really for what this is it
was<00:02:43.650> of<00:02:43.950> decent<00:02:44.520> quality<00:02:44.760> I<00:02:45.000> suppose<00:02:45.720> and

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
was of decent quality I suppose and

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:47.750 
was of decent quality I suppose and
saying<00:02:46.830> is<00:02:46.920> how<00:02:47.070> you<00:02:47.130> can't<00:02:47.460> really<00:02:47.610> get

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
saying is how you can't really get

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.540 
saying is how you can't really get
battlefield<00:02:48.240> 1942<00:02:48.840> without<00:02:49.320> it<00:02:49.560> it's<00:02:50.250> not

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550 
battlefield 1942 without it it's not

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:51.890 
battlefield 1942 without it it's not
really<00:02:50.700> a<00:02:50.820> matter<00:02:50.940> of<00:02:51.090> recommending<00:02:51.570> it<00:02:51.690> it's

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
really a matter of recommending it it's

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.270 
really a matter of recommending it it's
just<00:02:52.080> saying<00:02:52.380> that<00:02:52.620> it<00:02:52.770> was<00:02:52.980> kind<00:02:53.220> of

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
just saying that it was kind of

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.700 
just saying that it was kind of
lackluster<00:02:53.520> when<00:02:54.090> it<00:02:54.210> was<00:02:54.360> released<00:02:54.690> and<00:02:54.990> so

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:55.710 
lackluster when it was released and so

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:59.600 
lackluster when it was released and so
this<00:02:56.160> is<00:02:56.430> Jon<00:02:56.670> signing<00:02:57.000> off
