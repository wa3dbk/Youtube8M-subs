00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:27.210
 good friends 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.800
 this is a stepper motor some will 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.010
 they call bangladesh and clearly motor 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.570
 step by step of a volskwagen goal this 

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:35.100
 element is in charge of controlling the 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.220
 environment when the vehicle or the engine 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:40.949
 is at a minimum if he fails or 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:42.270
 is logically damaged we are going to have 

00:00:40.949 --> 00:00:44.640
 problems at minimum the motor can 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:47.720
 oxidize can go off can reach 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:50.160
 accelerate let's learn how to test 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:53.550
 this device to know if it's good 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.680
 regular or damaged and logically some 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.019
 jobs that you can do to 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.930
 try to recover let's go then to 

00:00:58.019 --> 00:01:03.170
 work with this one with this motor step to 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.170
 He passed 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:07.970
 once we have disassembled the valve 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:10.880
 one of the first tests that we're going to 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:13.550
 to do is to know if it opens or does not open for 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:15.170
 we connect two cables to him 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:17.299
 we observe here 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:19.299
 and we are going to proceed now to connect it 

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:23.299
 directly to a 12 volt battery 

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:25.369
 when connecting you must open the valve 

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:28.330
 curtain that internally moves like 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:30.470
 we observe here in this case it moves 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:33.370
 indicating that the valve is in 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:36.930
 in perfect conditions 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:36.930
 It is the first test we do 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:41.409
 in this second test with a 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:45.929
 screwdriver we open it so that it does not 

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:45.929
 basically present no obstacles 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:53.330
 once the previous ones have been made 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:56.330
 checks and verifications we are going to 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:02:00.620
 lubricate the valve we will add some 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:02.860
 little oil droplets so that 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:06.680
 the operation of the curtain valve 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:11.140
 be much softer and avoid that 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:11.140
 we may get stuck later 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:19.040
 once the previous ones have been made 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:22.190
 verification procedures and 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:24.290
 maintenance and installed as 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:27.050
 we observe here ready to work 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:29.920
 remember that she controls the passage of 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:29.920
 air in minimum 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:35.260
 thank you very much for your attention I hope 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:38.660
 that the explanation has been useful 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:41.060
 about this element 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:42.830
 we will see you again in another video 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.930
 to continue learning little things 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:47.050
 electronic injection thank you very much for 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:47.050
 your attention 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.550
