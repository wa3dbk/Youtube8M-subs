 created for the battlefields and you can save soon 

00:00:16.669 --> 00:00:19.669
 lives in the transit war the smart car 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:23.230
 who shows the correspondent contributes to them 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.989
 Let's go to the top driver. 

00:00:25.989 --> 00:00:28.989
 who rules here because artificial intelligence 

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:36.200
 she asserted took the wheel out and parked the car without scratches 

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:41.010
 then takes to the streets in the midst of other vehicles without accidents 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:45.210
 the researcher in the backseat and finish the course 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:46.920
 the other goes ahead 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.430
 pure precaution eight radio stations leyser realized what happens 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:53.490
 up to 200 meters away 

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:55.740
 Paris comes what is near 

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:58.740
 That's the way he stole it, he sees our world. 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:03.620
 the smart car called Junior was developed at Stanford University in 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:07.100
 California after the United States Secretary of Defense began to 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:11.670
 Offer millionaires prizes here to sell your vehicle help the soldiers in 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:12.930
 Iraq 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.170
 Junior is not ready for war yet 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:19.520
 but in the last race he covered 100 kilometers in an American stay 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:20.490
 present 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.109
 the traffic craziness just being very smart 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:27.170
 has a way that it is hidden in the trunk 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:28.530
 the brain 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.390
 are two computers that make the decisions and used these circuits 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:36.080
 a kind of nervous system to control 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:40.610
 the mechanical parts of the vehicle when all this is when launched and still 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:44.730
 with some technological advances our positions the positions of the future 

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:47.950
 they can also be smart 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:52.220
 in the first moment the robot can be a co-pilot for example to trigger the 

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:54.850
 brakes by a distracted driver 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:59.270
 Renaissance sebastiano beaches or one of the heads of the project gardens and not 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:03.050
 have doubt it starts to lose players will take us to the streets 

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:06.020
 while we watch television or we change from half a century 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.170
 luke half horta review 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:11.160
 researchers hope to help reduce the number of road deaths 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:16.060
 after all we humans are dangerous drivers and games 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:19.300
 certainly not complain about assuming the direction
