00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:17.410
 or the clarification na I am already here of 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:19.900
 new and I bring you an experiment of the 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:23.170
 mine as always good for this 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:28.190
 experiment has helped me paper 

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:32.290
 aluminum and dirt 

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:32.290
 and I'm going to cut little by little 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:37.410
 in very thin strip 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:48.320
 although you can do it now to 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.320
 your taste I'm going to leave the idea 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:31.120
 I applied a layer of coarse so that 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:33.210
 better trained the role of 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:33.210
 aluminum 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:39.729
 and the lame condotti 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:46.409
 I will use the spot part of the 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:49.530
 doping for what 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:51.420
 make less pressure when leaving the 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:55.799
 foil 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:58.080
 as advice if you learn a lot if 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:01.460
 the mark will remain then what we have 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:01.460
 what to do is apply a little 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:10.050
 because it's left to the tip of him 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:12.660
 of the doping of the punch remains marked 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:15.500
 in the aluminum foil then to 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:15.500
 press a little 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:31.500
 I think that this manicure is very easy 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:40.170
 and I 've never seen myself out there I've never 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:42.870
 seen doing any experiment with 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:44.640
 from an aluminum foil so I think 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:48.260
 that we should make it fashionable because it is 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.260
 that the truth is that it is very bright 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:06.110
 well this I have never seen 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:08.630
 with an aluminum foil so then 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:12.130
 I believe that a fast simple mount 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:14.360
 I can the option to do many 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:20.170
 drawings that already leaves you 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:20.170
 imagination we apply all 

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:26.330
 and I tell you something because you know little finger 

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:30.500
 up that I would be very proud of 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:32.490
 that cooperates and the experiment and that what 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:35.000
 I had a great time 

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:37.790
 I apply while you dig 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.120
 and I'm completely ready for the 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:40.120
 half 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:54.000
 so you know by day
