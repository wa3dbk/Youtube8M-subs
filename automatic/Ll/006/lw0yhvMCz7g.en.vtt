let's see what happened after this all

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.980 
let's see what happened after this all
right<00:00:15.900> I<00:00:16.170> say<00:00:16.920> seriously<00:00:17.340> I<00:00:17.970> said<00:00:18.660> it<00:00:18.810> would

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
right I say seriously I said it would

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.470 
right I say seriously I said it would
take<00:00:19.020> a<00:00:19.289> while<00:00:19.529> just<00:00:20.220> work<00:00:20.460> it<00:00:20.490> out<00:00:20.730> it<00:00:21.119> might

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
take a while just work it out it might

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.109 
take a while just work it out it might
be<00:00:21.689> a<00:00:22.020> half<00:00:22.410> hour<00:00:22.619> or<00:00:22.800> something<00:00:23.119> but

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
be a half hour or something but

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.310 
be a half hour or something but
basically<00:00:24.539> takes<00:00:25.260> me<00:00:27.080> approximately<00:00:28.080> 10

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
basically takes me approximately 10

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.720 
basically takes me approximately 10
minutes<00:00:28.939> basically<00:00:29.990> so<00:00:30.990> yeah<00:00:31.320> I<00:00:31.590> think<00:00:32.399> it's

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
minutes basically so yeah I think it's

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.549 
minutes basically so yeah I think it's

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:02:11.910 

seriously

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.750 

and<00:02:12.180> because<00:02:13.180> why<00:02:13.480> is<00:02:13.540> take<00:02:14.170> too<00:02:14.440> long<00:02:14.709> why<00:02:15.700> is

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
and because why is take too long why is

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.540 
and because why is take too long why is
extra<00:02:16.239> long<00:02:16.480> is<00:02:16.720> because<00:02:17.130> then<00:02:18.130> you<00:02:18.280> need<00:02:18.459> to

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:18.550 
extra long is because then you need to

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:21.750 
extra long is because then you need to
upload<00:02:18.910> the<00:02:19.270> special<00:02:19.840> frame<00:02:20.319> where<00:02:20.560> 1.3<00:02:21.459> to

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
upload the special frame where 1.3 to

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:26.100 
upload the special frame where 1.3 to
get<00:02:21.910> ipod<00:02:22.270> touch<00:02:22.510> and<00:02:22.810> it<00:02:23.590> is<00:02:23.770> like<00:02:24.010> 1<00:02:25.110> 116

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
get ipod touch and it is like 1 116

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:30.479 
get ipod touch and it is like 1 116
megabyte<00:02:26.830> when<00:02:27.430> you're<00:02:27.640> 65<00:02:28.000> megabyte<00:02:28.510> and<00:02:29.489> i

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:30.489 
megabyte when you're 65 megabyte and i

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:32.580 
megabyte when you're 65 megabyte and i
think<00:02:30.880> is<00:02:31.120> that<00:02:31.420> because<00:02:31.720> of<00:02:31.959> that<00:02:32.170> so<00:02:32.500> it

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
think is that because of that so it

00:02:32.590 --> 00:03:21.700 
think is that because of that so it
takes<00:02:32.770> so<00:02:33.010> long<00:02:33.930> and<00:02:34.930> yeah

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:21.710 

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:28.300
