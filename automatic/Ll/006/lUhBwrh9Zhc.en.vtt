 he is just not something either 

00:00:20.919 --> 00:00:23.769
 Bahr dts / red 

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:26.279
 Euro around 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.279
 It definitely looks good 

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:33.189
 who prefer 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:38.590
 more for everyone 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.440
 Keller, however, can be important now 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.340
 here is completed 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:49.340
 percent 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:52.150
 you too 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:53.230
 but 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:56.230
 AR here is open 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:00.500
 bv 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:01.710
 Dr 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.710
 the winter is not out of the race 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:08.620
 ste 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:12.990
 In that sense I can say everything is up again 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.470
 14 clogged 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:16.680
 and would 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.000
 that makes sense here 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
 let's see 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
 that was a nice trip not bringing us much now though 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.800
 the experience of knowing that we are only getting this 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.390
 take six driving lessons 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.390
 or like Father Noster 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:39.890
 H 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:42.890
 ste 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:46.190
 while not wrong with 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:48.480
 because none of the 2 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:51.480
 Yes 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.170
 what I hereby millions 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:08.079
 b 

00:02:08.079 --> 00:02:11.899
 I have always had to be called a bear by name 

00:02:14.249 --> 00:02:15.350
 the avenue 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:18.350
 the Nigerians their last of course with each new path 

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:22.129
 I just hope that's the way I said that the company understood on course 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:26.239
 It usually does not work that way and strength to understand that 

00:02:37.619 --> 00:02:40.619
 more even if all very worried you have to say 

00:02:45.669 --> 00:02:48.289
 For these users was the civil office or 

00:02:48.289 --> 00:02:49.189
 the good weather outside
