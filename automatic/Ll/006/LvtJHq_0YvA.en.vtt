guy slow hint the nose down long enough

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.280 
guy slow hint the nose down long enough
for<00:01:44.970> this<00:01:45.060> guy<00:01:45.299> to<00:01:45.329> come<00:01:45.689> through<00:01:45.960> and<00:01:46.140> scoop

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
for this guy to come through and scoop

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.920 
for this guy to come through and scoop
and<00:01:46.680> then<00:01:47.220> get<00:01:47.460> up<00:01:47.640> on<00:01:48.000> to<00:01:48.240> the<00:01:48.329> next<00:01:48.509> level

and then get up on to the next level

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.319 
and then get up on to the next level
usually<00:01:49.890> by<00:01:50.040> that<00:01:50.220> time<00:01:50.460> the<00:01:50.579> mic<00:01:50.790> should<00:01:51.149> be

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
usually by that time the mic should be

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.270 
usually by that time the mic should be
passed<00:01:51.600> but<00:01:52.140> if<00:01:52.320> you<00:01:52.439> can<00:01:52.619> get<00:01:52.770> the<00:01:52.890> mic<00:01:53.070> he

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
passed but if you can get the mic he

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.780 
passed but if you can get the mic he
automatically<00:01:54.560> makes<00:01:55.560> a<00:01:55.710> huge<00:01:56.040> lane<00:01:56.430> for<00:01:56.759> the

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
automatically makes a huge lane for the

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
running back to run through so that it

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.050

kind<00:01:58.950> of<00:01:59.070> starts<00:01:59.369> with<00:01:59.490> the<00:01:59.579> center<00:01:59.880> there

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
kind of starts with the center there

this 3-technique this tackle let's just

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:19.640 
this 3-technique this tackle let's just
say<00:06:16.860> in<00:06:17.070> this<00:06:17.220> case<00:06:17.490> the<00:06:17.880> tackle<00:06:18.390> stays<00:06:18.750> on<00:06:19.140> the

say in this case the tackle stays on the

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:22.550 
say in this case the tackle stays on the
outside<00:06:19.680> part<00:06:20.460> of<00:06:20.730> the<00:06:20.790> guard<00:06:21.120> right<00:06:21.570> so<00:06:22.170> he's

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:22.560 
outside part of the guard right so he's

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:24.500 
outside part of the guard right so he's
run<00:06:22.860> and<00:06:23.130> hook<00:06:23.280> them<00:06:23.430> he<00:06:23.640> cannot<00:06:23.940> hook<00:06:24.180> okay

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:24.510 
run and hook them he cannot hook okay

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:26.960 
run and hook them he cannot hook okay
he's<00:06:24.840> running<00:06:25.320> so<00:06:25.530> hard<00:06:25.740> at<00:06:26.100> that<00:06:26.460> point<00:06:26.790> it's

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:26.970 
he's running so hard at that point it's

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:29.270 
he's running so hard at that point it's
called<00:06:27.150> a<00:06:27.240> BIM<00:06:27.510> block<00:06:27.810> he<00:06:28.350> can<00:06:28.530> literally<00:06:28.890> turn

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:29.280 
called a BIM block he can literally turn

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:30.850 
called a BIM block he can literally turn
and<00:06:29.640> wheel<00:06:30.060> and

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:30.860 
and wheel and

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:33.610 
and wheel and
pin<00:06:31.280> that<00:06:31.580> and<00:06:31.969> you<00:06:32.389> see<00:06:32.569> everybody's<00:06:33.259> running

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:33.620 
pin that and you see everybody's running

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:35.920 
pin that and you see everybody's running
like<00:06:33.740> this<00:06:33.949> everybody's<00:06:34.490> running<00:06:34.699> this<00:06:35.330> block

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:35.930 
like this everybody's running this block

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:38.200 
like this everybody's running this block
right<00:06:35.960> here<00:06:36.229> is<00:06:36.650> a<00:06:36.680> cut<00:06:37.009> block<00:06:37.250> so<00:06:37.759> this<00:06:37.909> nose

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:38.210 
right here is a cut block so this nose

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:40.420 
right here is a cut block so this nose
is<00:06:38.240> down<00:06:38.689> so<00:06:38.930> now<00:06:39.050> you<00:06:39.110> have<00:06:39.229> the<00:06:39.409> center<00:06:39.770> up<00:06:40.159> on

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:40.430 
is down so now you have the center up on

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:43.270 
is down so now you have the center up on
the<00:06:40.520> mic<00:06:40.729> quickly<00:06:41.449> and<00:06:41.689> you'll<00:06:42.530> see<00:06:42.800> you<00:06:43.129> can

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:43.280 
the mic quickly and you'll see you can

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:45.100 
the mic quickly and you'll see you can
kind<00:06:43.520> of<00:06:43.580> see<00:06:43.729> if<00:06:43.849> this<00:06:44.060> is<00:06:44.240> pinned<00:06:44.509> here<00:06:44.930> and

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:45.110 
kind of see if this is pinned here and

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:47.140 
kind of see if this is pinned here and
that's<00:06:45.919> their<00:06:46.189> the<00:06:46.340> sand<00:06:46.610> will<00:06:46.759> run<00:06:46.969> himself

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:47.150 
that's their the sand will run himself

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:48.939 
that's their the sand will run himself
out<00:06:47.479> of<00:06:47.509> the<00:06:47.629> play<00:06:47.840> that's<00:06:48.349> where<00:06:48.740> this

00:06:48.939 --> 00:06:48.949 
out of the play that's where this

00:06:48.949 --> 00:06:51.279 
out of the play that's where this
cutback<00:06:49.250> Lane<00:06:49.729> goes<00:06:50.300> and<00:06:50.629> it<00:06:50.719> goes<00:06:50.840> north<00:06:51.169> and

00:06:51.279 --> 00:06:51.289 
cutback Lane goes and it goes north and

00:06:51.289 --> 00:06:52.629 
cutback Lane goes and it goes north and
south<00:06:51.530> in<00:06:51.650> a<00:06:51.710> hurry<00:06:51.740> and<00:06:52.099> it<00:06:52.159> creates<00:06:52.550> a

00:06:52.629 --> 00:06:52.639 
south in a hurry and it creates a

00:06:52.639 --> 00:06:54.040 
south in a hurry and it creates a
one-on-one<00:06:53.000> situation<00:06:53.210> with<00:06:53.870> just

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:54.050 
one-on-one situation with just

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:55.540 
one-on-one situation with just
appreciation<00:06:54.469> yes<00:06:54.680> of<00:06:54.889> the<00:06:54.949> kind<00:06:55.159> leak<00:06:55.310> in<00:06:55.460> the

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:55.550 
appreciation yes of the kind leak in the

00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:57.189 
appreciation yes of the kind leak in the
center<00:06:55.909> where<00:06:56.180> usually<00:06:56.449> this<00:06:56.719> is<00:06:56.900> a<00:06:56.930> little

00:06:57.189 --> 00:06:57.199 
center where usually this is a little

00:06:57.199 --> 00:06:58.990 
center where usually this is a little
combination<00:06:57.500> where<00:06:58.069> he's<00:06:58.280> chipping<00:06:58.639> and<00:06:58.879> then

00:06:58.990 --> 00:06:59.000 
combination where he's chipping and then

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:00.700 
combination where he's chipping and then
get<00:06:59.150> into<00:06:59.270> the<00:06:59.419> next<00:06:59.629> level<00:06:59.930> if<00:07:00.229> he's<00:07:00.439> going<00:07:00.620> to

00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:00.710 
get into the next level if he's going to

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:02.740 
get into the next level if he's going to
cut<00:07:00.949> it<00:07:01.069> can<00:07:01.520> the<00:07:01.639> center<00:07:01.939> even<00:07:02.240> be<00:07:02.360> involved

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:02.750 
cut it can the center even be involved

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:03.999 
cut it can the center even be involved
even<00:07:02.900> in<00:07:03.139> chipping<00:07:03.409> there's<00:07:03.560> that<00:07:03.650> considered

00:07:03.999 --> 00:07:04.009 
even in chipping there's that considered

00:07:04.009 --> 00:07:06.700 
even in chipping there's that considered
engaged<00:07:04.750> probably<00:07:05.750> if<00:07:05.930> it's<00:07:06.199> not<00:07:06.379> going<00:07:06.529> to<00:07:06.620> be

00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:06.710 
engaged probably if it's not going to be

00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:08.800 
engaged probably if it's not going to be
a<00:07:06.740> true<00:07:07.370> engagement<00:07:07.550> you'll<00:07:08.120> probably<00:07:08.389> almost

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:08.810 
a true engagement you'll probably almost

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:11.110 
a true engagement you'll probably almost
just<00:07:09.169> be<00:07:09.349> almost<00:07:09.800> a<00:07:10.069> run<00:07:10.279> pocket<00:07:10.759> it'll<00:07:11.000> be

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:11.120 
just be almost a run pocket it'll be

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:12.879 
just be almost a run pocket it'll be
like<00:07:11.150> a<00:07:11.330> brush<00:07:11.779> fire<00:07:12.050> like<00:07:12.409> whether<00:07:12.680> he's

00:07:12.879 --> 00:07:12.889 
like a brush fire like whether he's

00:07:12.889 --> 00:07:14.499 
like a brush fire like whether he's
ripping<00:07:13.279> through<00:07:13.520> or<00:07:13.669> whether<00:07:13.849> you<00:07:14.060> show<00:07:14.270> the

00:07:14.499 --> 00:07:14.509 
ripping through or whether you show the

00:07:14.509 --> 00:07:16.240 
ripping through or whether you show the
show<00:07:14.750> right<00:07:14.990> let's<00:07:15.590> say<00:07:15.710> you're<00:07:15.860> the<00:07:15.889> center

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:16.250 
show right let's say you're the center

00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:17.830 
show right let's say you're the center
and<00:07:16.699> I'm<00:07:16.819> going<00:07:16.939> to<00:07:17.000> be<00:07:17.090> the<00:07:17.180> nose<00:07:17.360> tackle

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:17.840 
and I'm going to be the nose tackle

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:19.420 
and I'm going to be the nose tackle
you're<00:07:18.319> going<00:07:18.439> to<00:07:18.500> come<00:07:18.680> on<00:07:18.860> be<00:07:18.949> shaded<00:07:19.279> this

00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:19.430 
you're going to come on be shaded this

00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:21.550 
you're going to come on be shaded this
way<00:07:19.610> up<00:07:19.849> and<00:07:20.120> I<00:07:20.569> mean<00:07:20.719> it<00:07:21.110> might<00:07:21.319> be<00:07:21.529> just

00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:21.560 
way up and I mean it might be just

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:23.379 
way up and I mean it might be just
something<00:07:21.949> as<00:07:22.159> simple<00:07:22.400> as<00:07:22.669> just<00:07:22.849> that<00:07:22.969> so<00:07:23.270> you

00:07:23.379 --> 00:07:23.389 
something as simple as just that so you

00:07:23.389 --> 00:07:25.540 
something as simple as just that so you
get<00:07:23.629> up<00:07:23.750> to<00:07:23.870> the<00:07:23.990> second<00:07:24.379> level<00:07:24.409> just<00:07:25.189> slow

00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:25.550 
get up to the second level just slow

00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:27.730 
get up to the second level just slow
down<00:07:25.580> just<00:07:26.120> enough<00:07:26.330> keep<00:07:26.779> them<00:07:26.990> on<00:07:27.199> get<00:07:27.590> on

00:07:27.730 --> 00:07:27.740 
down just enough keep them on get on

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:29.619 
down just enough keep them on get on
that<00:07:27.860> track<00:07:28.219> so<00:07:28.430> that<00:07:28.460> that<00:07:28.789> offensive<00:07:29.300> guard

00:07:29.619 --> 00:07:29.629 
that track so that that offensive guard

00:07:29.629 --> 00:07:31.179 
that track so that that offensive guard
can<00:07:29.810> get<00:07:29.960> to<00:07:30.139> them<00:07:30.229> and<00:07:30.469> that<00:07:30.889> will<00:07:31.069> be<00:07:31.159> a

00:07:31.179 --> 00:07:31.189 
can get to them and that will be a

00:07:31.189 --> 00:07:33.100 
can get to them and that will be a
couple<00:07:31.460> lock<00:07:31.669> he'll<00:07:31.879> go<00:07:32.060> down<00:07:32.090> and<00:07:32.509> you'll<00:07:32.900> see

00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:33.110 
couple lock he'll go down and you'll see

00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:35.890 
couple lock he'll go down and you'll see
a<00:07:33.139> gaping<00:07:33.740> hole<00:07:33.800> go<00:07:34.250> in<00:07:34.430> there<00:07:34.639> if<00:07:34.669> this<00:07:35.120> guy<00:07:35.330> if

00:07:35.890 --> 00:07:35.900 
a gaping hole go in there if this guy if

00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:38.050 
a gaping hole go in there if this guy if
the<00:07:36.469> three-technique<00:07:37.069> keeps<00:07:37.339> up<00:07:37.550> and<00:07:37.849> eat

00:07:38.050 --> 00:07:38.060 
the three-technique keeps up and eat

00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:40.029 
the three-technique keeps up and eat
seals<00:07:38.270> and<00:07:38.629> that's<00:07:38.960> where<00:07:39.199> alex<00:07:39.589> gibbs<00:07:39.830> in<00:07:39.949> the

00:07:40.029 --> 00:07:40.039 
seals and that's where alex gibbs in the

00:07:40.039 --> 00:07:41.769 
seals and that's where alex gibbs in the
cup<00:07:40.219> locket<00:07:40.550> is<00:07:40.639> so<00:07:40.819> very<00:07:41.029> important<00:07:41.449> for<00:07:41.659> this

00:07:41.769 --> 00:07:41.779 
cup locket is so very important for this

00:07:41.779 --> 00:07:42.790 
cup locket is so very important for this
system<00:07:42.110> and<00:07:42.139> i<00:07:42.229> think<00:07:42.440> that's<00:07:42.589> where<00:07:42.680> you're

00:07:42.790 --> 00:07:42.800 
system and i think that's where you're

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:44.439 
system and i think that's where you're
going<00:07:42.919> to<00:07:42.979> see<00:07:43.099> a<00:07:43.129> huge<00:07:43.430> improvement<00:07:43.550> guys

00:07:44.439 --> 00:07:44.449 
going to see a huge improvement guys
