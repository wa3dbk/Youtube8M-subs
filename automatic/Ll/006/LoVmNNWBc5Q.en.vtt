00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:18.190
 Sasha to level the victory 2 your game 2 

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:21.310
 equals 0 such first impressions after this 

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:25.230
 today's victories would squeeze any 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:25.230
 victory she evokes emotions 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:30.449
 we now can not let you want at all 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.619
 it is clear that 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:40.910
 the field is depressing was 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.760
 I think that almost correctly collected 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:46.790
 bet us then 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:49.060
 it is ultimately present fruit 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:53.940
 I think that 

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:56.070
 you can get out of here with these 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.480
 sash we today largely thanks to your 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.320
 the game is certainly not detracting from the same 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.589
 merits 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.760
 teammates to give you 

00:01:00.589 --> 00:01:04.500
 drawing when it turned out the way it is 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.299
 became there remember the third minute when 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.430
 Whistler jumped one on one you 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:11.190
 bailed out not at the end too as if 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.229
 penalty kick will be your opponent 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:17.119
 score 21 and anything could happen 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:21.060
 Here, touching this penalty, I wanted to know 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:26.000
 reacted by shock or wondered know 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.000
 you very fi prices 3a batteries 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:31.310
 tips 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:34.140
 bones with our vision how gives one 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:35.270
 the result that we show a blood 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.810
 I think this 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:40.890
 general such 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:42.720
 total work that gives the result 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.390
 from attacks 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.830
 and all doing a common thing and one for all and 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.060
 all for one 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:53.070
 hands somewhere I dressed I then 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:53.070
 so it is necessary to continue to the end 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.909
 ultimately need 

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:00.399
 I know that in Belgorod you were very 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:02.499
 comfortable and played and lived now 

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:04.090
 grabbed under the season a new course 

00:02:02.499 --> 00:02:05.799
 the team has already held two official 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:09.310
 matches such feelings among the people know about 

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:11.330
 a lot of things nice today that 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:14.410
 fans 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.410
 course hit 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.110
 I think he 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.870
 will we win the fans 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:23.810
 and the evaluation of the fans it is very important 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:25.819
 show for me including 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:28.200
 always listen like 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:31.060
 critics are so positive 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:33.260
 and when fans 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:35.590
 I welcome you after the game, we have this 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.590
 what 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:38.950
 I, for one, 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:41.440
 i am what i do 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:44.070
 will continue 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.070
 all power 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.180
 mercy of course purposes
