00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:01.310
 and then I still have 

00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:02.169
 Further 

00:00:02.169 --> 00:00:05.020
 as an example and that is about the very latest badges 

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:06.390
 that is here now 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.439
 to pull against offers 

00:00:09.439 --> 00:00:12.439
 in addition to it I play him here times 

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:15.419
 the material off 

00:00:15.419 --> 00:00:18.810
 so the recording could have already lovingly seen and now four times in 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.810
 one sees the changed form around one 

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:25.759
 Glitter z 

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:26.609
 around 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.480
 how does it work 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.699
 to the resources difference to the industry just not expected there 

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:32.350
 filter 

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:35.930
 but I can go I apply this filter to any image 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.180
 some just 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:40.560
 same game 

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:41.539
 Dieter pull 

00:00:41.539 --> 00:00:45.219
 Should I go here as a filter or just as a transition with it 

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:48.450
 filter 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.450
 this one scene I have that I can now with a variety of 9 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:55.720
 Lux provided that starts with simply making Vienna look like a movie 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:59.880
 If I say I have the whole Bernert times in the style of the seventies or 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:02.660
 so a bit washed out overexposed 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:06.520
 or even that looks so yes to explore on the eighties of 4 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:07.890
 Foris coming 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.500
 Glandorf finished Lux ​​which are underlined here 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.030
 while the tour is outside percent 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:17.480
 Prof from 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:21.710
 very good to bring a result the pleasant at this perfect it 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:24.479
 Of course here the city works about the color and about blurring 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:25.710
 less now 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.360
 to be with with any things rendered before 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:31.250
 that one takes over the light effects also takes over optical filters 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:33.540
 can reach if mass conversion lens 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.730
 for example 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:39.040
 here is a total there is not with their number of 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:40.100
 to filter brightly 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.100
 which are included with presets 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:46.630
 basically, it's always the same thing to me for twelve days 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:48.940
 but can not get up here 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:51.900
 yes fall back about 650 specifications 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:54.720
 nice if I, for example, here also these blurred the integrated 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.660
 really like I just missed it you can imagine 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:01.540
 that percent ventures is changing over time accordingly 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.850
 because it was completely Keith's race as well 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:07.280
 that I'm really very nice blurs effective with too 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.280
 can generate 

00:02:10.939 --> 00:02:13.150
 make others ask you to bring 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.730
 Percent examples clearly so you can see the picture percent in many ways and ways 

00:02:18.589 --> 00:02:19.440
 Per 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.679
 Frame and also the numbers leave so 

00:02:22.679 --> 00:02:24.990
 Percent changes with the subject 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:26.250
 which is nice 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.530
 that just the picture activates so not to prefabricated frame so one 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:31.249
 he looks very nice 

00:02:31.249 --> 00:02:32.859
 Arbinger TV tower 

00:02:32.859 --> 00:02:34.799
 yes on Alex Dr 

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:36.789
 the clans really did that for the deed 

00:02:36.789 --> 00:02:39.529
 to effects exactly in the appropriate place and if here in the picture what 

00:02:39.529 --> 00:02:41.980
 happened or loud or yet who through this line then 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:42.850
 stop too 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:44.819
 the infection is perfect at this 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:47.319
 according to place 

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:48.569
 they will be here too 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:53.060
 Robertson's most basic requirement is actually relative to this 

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:56.799
 Deficits did not fade away 

00:02:56.799 --> 00:03:01.189
 so a lot of presets i had shown them by the display numbers 

00:03:01.189 --> 00:03:02.459
 Places effect 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:05.179
 It is also about the Lehmann 

00:03:05.179 --> 00:03:06.369
 too general 

00:03:06.369 --> 00:03:09.139
 Schuhmann the choir sang doing it would then laugh at recording certainly 

00:03:09.139 --> 00:03:12.139
 better suited for these shots 

00:03:15.719 --> 00:03:19.870
 are different percent of these fats they can apply all of them 

00:03:19.869 --> 00:03:22.429
 Percent of the nice ones towards the end 

00:03:22.429 --> 00:03:25.079
 to generate a quick blog percent 

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:27.799
 what I really want to show in here but now 

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:29.069
 so stupid 

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:31.459
 what else before I get to it 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:32.759
 but maybe still 

00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:35.799
 but the hint you can of course 

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:39.519
 Percent effects also on title users sure that here in quite simple 

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:42.889
 Percent originally performed Juve Chen Song Contest 

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:45.130
 and percent off on this title 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:47.279
 then one percent 

00:03:47.279 --> 00:03:50.439
 Filters from Witte that they are applied in because the filters are not only 

00:03:50.439 --> 00:03:53.070
 Video footage as well as week appearances of walls 

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:57.859
 and that is also new to version 2 she decided for so well 

00:03:57.859 --> 00:03:59.680
 too special 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:03.089
 the text if they were integrated without end 

00:04:03.089 --> 00:04:05.760
 Boll will then just the material accordingly 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.550
 is processed and 

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:10.029
 yes I think you can do it 

00:04:10.029 --> 00:04:12.389
 to look at this example quite well with these 

00:04:12.389 --> 00:04:13.929
 Hunting field relative 

00:04:13.929 --> 00:04:18.049
 to the Schlichter title actually we are here in the evening just with the 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:19.769
 Standard Premiere Pfeiffer 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:23.759
 yes in a font Rheine led now without big 3d stories 

00:04:23.759 --> 00:04:26.080
 but i can if i am now 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:29.570
 here so judge about such lighting effects on it 

00:04:29.569 --> 00:04:30.789
 I can do different 

00:04:30.789 --> 00:04:34.869
 to generate illuminated Fekter where else I simply spend more time 

00:04:34.869 --> 00:04:39.050
 would have to invest a comparable Daphne 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:42.460
 Effect or maybe with near hiking software to generate 

00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:47.030
 just that they also saw that Let's new 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:51.060
 you so old had interacted with the title "socially punched and the Galli 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:54.220
 Just do it on the surface so that it just determines these radiations 

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:57.689
 Direction then, for example, can make 

00:04:57.689 --> 00:05:01.230
 and that comes the real reason why I then pay attention to it 

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:02.569
 climbed 

00:05:02.569 --> 00:05:06.340
 he just wanted to make me normal here and cheer the sea 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:08.770
 Percent counted to 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:10.599
 this purpose 

00:05:10.599 --> 00:05:13.599
 you can do a loop a lot 

00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:16.099
 Sign that way 

00:05:16.099 --> 00:05:19.889
 and in order to easily fill energy from above for free 

00:05:20.479 --> 00:05:24.319
 then you can use it in conjunction with how they are a toy country 

00:05:24.319 --> 00:05:26.999
 Make effect that is also the reason why I before 

00:05:26.999 --> 00:05:29.559
 for the Roman Song Contest 

00:05:29.559 --> 00:05:30.469
 because 

00:05:30.469 --> 00:05:31.439
 around 

00:05:31.439 --> 00:05:34.090
 There he was in Germany as a whole 

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:37.180
 so toyland percent shown 

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:40.520
 and and so the muscles how easy that is so the shot I have it myself 

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:44.100
 made within and i dont know when these customers i just got 

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:47.820
 in this way on it and kept only the standard filter on it 

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:51.340
 So I did not do any big tricks about this pressure 

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:55.340
 then it can certainly do even better but for the sake of brevity 

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:57.530
 the time I applied one 

00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:01.090
 Thinking, the result has actually become completely dat, whereby I am less there 

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:01.619
 me 

00:06:01.619 --> 00:06:04.699
 Pröll wants to blame for the good result as a percent actually 

00:06:04.699 --> 00:06:06.110
 here this pack in 

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:07.800
 which is just right 

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:10.629
 succeeded in the man also other example here you can see for sure 

00:06:10.629 --> 00:06:13.760
 that coffee restaurant Moscow across the street 

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:17.530
 from Cinema International where we had in the Digital Sister 

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:20.980
 that was at the time the percent train Cinema of the DDR Moss is everything 

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:23.889
 filmed from the same point of view just just shoot the camera a bit more 

00:06:23.889 --> 00:06:24.800
 to the side 

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:28.650
 Interesting is how this filter works "You can see that percent 

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:32.569
 one in certain areas just left and can do it there right now 

00:06:32.569 --> 00:06:33.759
 so the center of the picture 

00:06:33.759 --> 00:06:34.779
 Schaaf stays 

00:06:34.779 --> 00:06:37.080
 the colors are very gaudy 

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:41.360
 And you can also improve this effect by giving it something 

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:44.200
 was made at the logical song contest 

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:46.990
 the speed one more increased what he stood example 

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:47.439
 have 

00:06:47.439 --> 00:06:50.439
 you can imagine if this recording would be something Lehner 

00:06:51.419 --> 00:06:54.279
 we make a speed change were just doing 

00:06:54.279 --> 00:06:55.409
 speed 

00:06:55.409 --> 00:06:58.409
 whatever 400 percent 

00:07:00.219 --> 00:07:03.219
 especially on the target summed up plus on the keyboard 

00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:07.960
 Worrying kids formally see this area as in &amp; out and then you see 

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:08.900
 his sentences 

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:12.449
 played a little faster then it seems even more like suns 

00:07:13.409 --> 00:07:14.649
 more this toy country
