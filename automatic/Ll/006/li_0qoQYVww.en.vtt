00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
do is I come right up into the solids

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:55.790 
do is I come right up into the solids
filter<00:00:49.399> and<00:00:50.399> it<00:00:51.030> flows<00:00:52.190> let<00:00:53.190> me<00:00:53.309> get<00:00:53.460> this<00:00:54.800> silk

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
solids floating around in there but it

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.689 
solids floating around in there but it
flows<00:00:59.850> in<00:01:00.120> through<00:01:00.570> a<00:01:00.989> pipe<00:01:01.890> that<00:01:02.190> has<00:01:02.340> turned

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
flows in through a pipe that has turned

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:07.399 
flows in through a pipe that has turned
opposite<00:01:03.329> directions<00:01:03.629> to<00:01:03.930> help<00:01:04.199> it<00:01:05.840> spin<00:01:06.840> to

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
opposite directions to help it spin to

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:12.260 
opposite directions to help it spin to
help<00:01:07.590> it<00:01:07.740> kind<00:01:08.159> of<00:01:08.250> turn<00:01:08.460> in<00:01:08.850> there<00:01:09.439> so<00:01:11.270> the

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
help it kind of turn in there so the

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.630 
help it kind of turn in there so the
cast<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:13.140> water<00:01:13.380> has<00:01:13.590> to<00:01:13.619> come<00:01:13.770> up<00:01:14.159> back<00:01:14.400> up

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
cast the water has to come up back up

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.280 
cast the water has to come up back up
through<00:01:14.850> this<00:01:15.030> filter<00:01:15.479> pad<00:01:15.810> that<00:01:15.990> I<00:01:16.080> just

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
through this filter pad that I just

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.120 
through this filter pad that I just
raised<00:01:16.500> out<00:01:16.740> of<00:01:16.770> there<00:01:17.119> and<00:01:18.920> through<00:01:19.920> that

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
raised out of there and through that

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:26.179 
raised out of there and through that
overflow<00:01:20.670> right<00:01:20.939> there<00:01:22.400> it<00:01:23.400> goes<00:01:24.799> over<00:01:25.799> here

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
overflow right there it goes over here

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:31.010 
overflow right there it goes over here
into<00:01:27.380> the<00:01:28.380> bio<00:01:28.590> filter<00:01:29.130> now<00:01:29.659> when<00:01:30.659> it<00:01:30.750> enters

the<00:01:31.110> bio<00:01:31.290> filter<00:01:31.799> you<00:01:32.130> can<00:01:32.310> see<00:01:32.460> that<00:01:32.670> little

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
the bio filter you can see that little

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.960 
the bio filter you can see that little
90-degree<00:01:33.630> turn<00:01:33.930> down<00:01:34.229> there<00:01:34.439> it<00:01:35.340> turns<00:01:35.670> and

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
90-degree turn down there it turns and

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.640 
90-degree turn down there it turns and
goes<00:01:36.150> through<00:01:36.329> a<00:01:36.450> two<00:01:36.630> inch<00:01:36.810> pipe<00:01:37.140> to<00:01:37.409> about

goes through a two inch pipe to about

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.210 
goes through a two inch pipe to about
four<00:01:37.920> inches<00:01:38.280> off<00:01:38.460> of<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:38.670> bottom<00:01:40.070> what<00:01:41.070> that

four inches off of the bottom what that
does<00:01:41.460> is<00:01:41.670> that<00:01:41.850> forces<00:01:42.299> the<00:01:42.479> new<00:01:42.509> water<00:01:42.899> in<00:01:43.170> at

lava rock the bubbles are kind of

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.100 
lava rock the bubbles are kind of
messing<00:01:49.740> the<00:01:50.070> picture<00:01:50.460> up<00:01:50.640> but<00:01:50.960> bubbles<00:01:51.960> are

about five inches from the bottom about
half<00:02:00.390> the<00:02:00.570> barrel<00:02:00.930> I<00:02:01.159> can't<00:02:02.159> see<00:02:02.340> it<00:02:02.399> from<00:02:02.549> out

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
half the barrel I can't see it from out

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.940 
half the barrel I can't see it from out
here<00:02:02.909> but<00:02:03.119> about<00:02:03.719> half<00:02:03.990> the<00:02:04.170> barrel<00:02:04.530> is<00:02:04.680> filled

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
here but about half the barrel is filled

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.440 
here but about half the barrel is filled
with<00:02:05.189> lava<00:02:05.610> rock

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
with lava rock

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:11.330 
with lava rock
and<00:02:06.900> that's<00:02:07.140> about<00:02:07.310> this<00:02:08.310> level<00:02:08.670> here<00:02:10.340> okay

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
and that's about this level here okay

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.300 
and that's about this level here okay
then<00:02:12.239> there<00:02:12.959> are<00:02:13.050> several<00:02:13.319> filter<00:02:13.800> pads<00:02:14.040> on

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
then there are several filter pads on

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.360 
then there are several filter pads on
top<00:02:14.550> of<00:02:14.730> that<00:02:15.500> I'll<00:02:16.500> see<00:02:16.650> if<00:02:16.739> I<00:02:16.800> can<00:02:16.950> raise<00:02:17.099> one

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
top of that I'll see if I can raise one

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:18.790 
top of that I'll see if I can raise one
of<00:02:17.430> them<00:02:17.580> out<00:02:17.700> of<00:02:17.849> here

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:18.800 
of them out of here

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.589 
of them out of here
there<00:02:19.800> is<00:02:19.920> a<00:02:19.950> filter<00:02:20.370> pad<00:02:20.580> you<00:02:21.180> can<00:02:21.300> see<00:02:21.420> I<00:02:21.450> just

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:21.599 
there is a filter pad you can see I just

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:23.600 
there is a filter pad you can see I just
got<00:02:21.780> a<00:02:21.900> round<00:02:22.349> filter<00:02:22.770> pad<00:02:22.950> that<00:02:23.130> I've<00:02:23.220> cut<00:02:23.459> to

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
got a round filter pad that I've cut to

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.790 
got a round filter pad that I've cut to
a<00:02:23.640> round<00:02:23.940> shape<00:02:24.209> I<00:02:24.450> think<00:02:25.080> it's<00:02:25.200> basically<00:02:25.410> an

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
a round shape I think it's basically an

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.760 
a round shape I think it's basically an
air<00:02:25.920> conditioning<00:02:26.400> pad<00:02:27.470> but<00:02:28.470> I've<00:02:28.620> got

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770 
air conditioning pad but I've got

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:31.729 
air conditioning pad but I've got
several<00:02:29.160> of<00:02:29.220> those<00:02:29.370> on<00:02:29.760> top<00:02:30.209> of<00:02:30.930> the<00:02:31.230> lava<00:02:31.410> rock

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:31.739 
several of those on top of the lava rock

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:37.339 
several of those on top of the lava rock
and<00:02:32.480> the<00:02:33.480> air<00:02:33.980> because<00:02:34.980> your<00:02:35.840> bacteria<00:02:36.840> needs

00:02:37.339 --> 00:02:37.349 
and the air because your bacteria needs

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:40.030 
and the air because your bacteria needs
an<00:02:37.769> oxygen<00:02:38.220> supply<00:02:38.700> just<00:02:39.209> like<00:02:39.330> your<00:02:39.510> fish<00:02:39.720> do

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
an oxygen supply just like your fish do

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.729 
an oxygen supply just like your fish do
to<00:02:41.040> thrive<00:02:41.370> and<00:02:41.640> to<00:02:41.700> grow<00:02:41.819> strong<00:02:42.470> this<00:02:43.470> air

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:43.739 
to thrive and to grow strong this air

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:48.640 
to thrive and to grow strong this air
stone<00:02:44.190> is<00:02:44.459> placed<00:02:44.790> into<00:02:45.150> the<00:02:46.100> bottom<00:02:47.100> of<00:02:47.190> this

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
stone is placed into the bottom of this

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:52.910 
stone is placed into the bottom of this
mário<00:02:49.650> filter<00:02:50.040> but<00:02:50.280> above<00:02:51.080> the<00:02:52.080> outlet<00:02:52.590> at<00:02:52.799> the

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
mário filter but above the outlet at the

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:54.440 
mário filter but above the outlet at the
end<00:02:53.100> of<00:02:53.250> the<00:02:53.310> pipe<00:02:53.519> down<00:02:53.760> there<00:02:53.910> so<00:02:54.120> I'd<00:02:54.180> say

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
end of the pipe down there so I'd say

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.360 
end of the pipe down there so I'd say
it's<00:02:54.630> probably<00:02:55.019> about<00:02:55.080> five<00:02:55.440> inches<00:02:55.830> up<00:02:56.069> and

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
it's probably about five inches up and

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.580 
it's probably about five inches up and
it's<00:02:56.640> just<00:02:56.700> sandwiched<00:02:57.540> in<00:02:57.750> between<00:02:57.780> two<00:02:58.080> good

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
it's just sandwiched in between two good

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:01.360 
it's just sandwiched in between two good
air<00:02:58.860> stone<00:02:59.160> it's<00:02:59.370> sandwiched<00:02:59.790> in<00:03:00.000> between<00:03:00.030> the

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
air stone it's sandwiched in between the

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:05.840 
air stone it's sandwiched in between the
in<00:03:02.370> between<00:03:02.819> the<00:03:02.940> lava<00:03:03.150> rock<00:03:04.100> or<00:03:05.100> in<00:03:05.459> between

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:05.850 
in between the lava rock or in between

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:09.500 
in between the lava rock or in between
the<00:03:06.739> yep<00:03:07.739> the<00:03:07.950> lava<00:03:08.160> rock<00:03:08.400> it's<00:03:09.030> blob<00:03:09.269> of<00:03:09.390> rock

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
the yep the lava rock it's blob of rock

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.860 
the yep the lava rock it's blob of rock
is<00:03:09.660> under<00:03:09.930> it<00:03:10.049> lava<00:03:10.319> rock<00:03:10.530> is<00:03:10.709> over<00:03:10.859> it

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 
is under it lava rock is over it

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:17.479 
is under it lava rock is over it
so<00:03:13.070> um<00:03:14.390> from<00:03:15.390> there<00:03:15.630> it<00:03:16.019> overflows<00:03:16.950> at<00:03:17.280> that

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
so um from there it overflows at that

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:22.759 
so um from there it overflows at that
outlet<00:03:18.320> into<00:03:19.370> this<00:03:21.200> sump<00:03:22.200> and<00:03:22.410> this<00:03:22.620> is

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:22.769 
outlet into this sump and this is

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:25.250 
outlet into this sump and this is
nothing<00:03:22.920> more<00:03:23.250> than<00:03:23.459> a<00:03:23.519> sump<00:03:23.880> that's<00:03:24.630> got<00:03:24.959> a

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
nothing more than a sump that's got a

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:30.400 
nothing more than a sump that's got a
pump<00:03:25.769> and<00:03:26.690> a<00:03:27.829> heater<00:03:28.829> there's<00:03:29.609> a<00:03:29.760> heater

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:30.410 
pump and a heater there's a heater

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:34.240 
pump and a heater there's a heater
that's<00:03:31.410> the<00:03:31.620> thousand<00:03:32.100> watt<00:03:32.510> bucket<00:03:33.510> heater<00:03:33.720> I

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:34.250 
that's the thousand watt bucket heater I

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:37.880 
that's the thousand watt bucket heater I
plug<00:03:35.250> it<00:03:35.370> in<00:03:35.489> only<00:03:35.700> when<00:03:35.940> necessary<00:03:36.709> it<00:03:37.709> does

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:37.890 
plug it in only when necessary it does

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:39.470 
plug it in only when necessary it does
take<00:03:38.100> a<00:03:38.130> lot<00:03:38.370> of<00:03:38.400> energy<00:03:38.549> to<00:03:38.910> run<00:03:39.060> that<00:03:39.269> thing

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
take a lot of energy to run that thing

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:43.699 
take a lot of energy to run that thing
but<00:03:39.750> it<00:03:40.739> works<00:03:41.010> fine<00:03:42.140> and<00:03:43.140> then<00:03:43.350> it's<00:03:43.500> pumped

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
but it works fine and then it's pumped

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:45.740 
but it works fine and then it's pumped
up<00:03:43.950> through<00:03:44.400> that<00:03:44.549> hose<00:03:44.790> and<00:03:44.820> across<00:03:45.450> this

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
up through that hose and across this

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:49.920 
up through that hose and across this
bank<00:03:46.109> of<00:03:47.510> of<00:03:48.510> toes

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:49.930 
bank of of toes

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:53.610 
bank of of toes
in<00:03:50.260> our<00:03:50.620> 3/4<00:03:51.159> inch<00:03:51.310> pipe<00:03:52.049> and<00:03:53.049> you<00:03:53.200> can<00:03:53.379> see

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:53.620 
in our 3/4 inch pipe and you can see

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:56.850 
in our 3/4 inch pipe and you can see
back<00:03:54.549> there<00:03:54.849> how<00:03:55.060> it's<00:03:55.239> flowing<00:03:55.629> out<00:03:55.780> and<00:03:56.680> it

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:56.860 
back there how it's flowing out and it

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:01.020 
back there how it's flowing out and it
flows<00:03:57.780> like<00:03:58.780> that<00:03:59.049> very<00:04:00.010> similarly<00:04:00.489> out<00:04:00.849> of

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:01.030 
flows like that very similarly out of

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:03.869 
flows like that very similarly out of
every<00:04:01.480> pipe<00:04:01.890> your<00:04:02.890> water<00:04:03.099> level<00:04:03.310> will<00:04:03.640> seek

00:04:03.869 --> 00:04:03.879 
every pipe your water level will seek

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:06.449 
every pipe your water level will seek
its<00:04:04.060> own<00:04:04.209> level<00:04:04.689> so<00:04:05.019> it<00:04:05.620> doesn't<00:04:06.010> have<00:04:06.129> to<00:04:06.280> be

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:06.459 
its own level so it doesn't have to be

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:08.729 
its own level so it doesn't have to be
the<00:04:07.030> valves<00:04:07.390> don't<00:04:07.510> have<00:04:07.720> to<00:04:07.840> be<00:04:07.959> exact<00:04:08.409> but

00:04:08.729 --> 00:04:08.739 
the valves don't have to be exact but

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:10.440 
the valves don't have to be exact but
it's<00:04:08.920> best<00:04:09.280> to<00:04:09.400> keep<00:04:09.609> them<00:04:09.760> closed<00:04:10.030> so<00:04:10.299> that

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:10.450 
it's best to keep them closed so that

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:12.410 
it's best to keep them closed so that
way<00:04:10.599> a<00:04:10.629> tank<00:04:11.019> doesn't<00:04:11.260> overfill<00:04:11.950> and<00:04:12.220> then

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:12.420 
way a tank doesn't overfill and then

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:18.840 
way a tank doesn't overfill and then
just<00:04:13.420> empty<00:04:13.750> that<00:04:13.900> one<00:04:14.079> tank<00:04:15.239> so<00:04:17.639> that's<00:04:18.639> what

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:18.850 
just empty that one tank so that's what

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:19.650 
just empty that one tank so that's what
we're<00:04:19.000> doing<00:04:19.239> in<00:04:19.359> here

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:19.660 
we're doing in here

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:24.060 
we're doing in here
I've<00:04:19.930> got<00:04:22.260> general<00:04:23.260> fish<00:04:23.440> down<00:04:23.650> in<00:04:23.860> here<00:04:24.010> you

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:24.070 
I've got general fish down in here you

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:26.100 
I've got general fish down in here you
maybe<00:04:24.970> you<00:04:25.120> can<00:04:25.240> see<00:04:25.479> them<00:04:25.570> I'm<00:04:25.750> not<00:04:25.870> sure<00:04:25.930> if

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:26.110 
maybe you can see them I'm not sure if

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:30.360 
maybe you can see them I'm not sure if
you<00:04:26.229> can<00:04:26.410> or<00:04:26.590> not<00:04:27.389> these<00:04:28.389> fish<00:04:28.750> here<00:04:29.110> are<00:04:29.370> this

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:30.370 
you can or not these fish here are this
