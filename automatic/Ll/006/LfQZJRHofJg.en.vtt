00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.440
 hello russian youtube and roncero 617 

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:05.080
 and I am vicent 

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:07.939
 for a little bit we did not save ourselves from that persecution 

00:00:07.939 --> 00:00:12.509
 and all that was just because they say a gum lock seven eleven xd xd 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:13.619
 xd 

00:00:13.619 --> 00:00:17.849
 Well let's start today we're going to talk about something we've realized 

00:00:17.849 --> 00:00:18.980
 vicentillo 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:21.260
 the trivia of video games 

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.740
 You YouTube Ros have not realized some of the things 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:28.300
 irreverent that can be noticed in most videogames 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.099
 and if you had not noticed it, it's because you're a geek who has no friends or 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.730
 video games xd xd xd x 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:37.320
 good going back to the topic 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.700
 by a very curious curiosity xd xd xd xd xd few have background 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:46.220
 good one of the deadliest dangers of videogames since the 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:50.190
 start of the industry are without a doubt the abysses or bottomless pit in 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.700
 where it falls if you lose a fucking life 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:56.500
 Well the funny thing is not wondering why they are there but loser 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:00.250
 he took the trouble to finish them throughout the worlds so that it cost him 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:02.720
 more work to the heroes to reach the end 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:07.160
 curiously in various games these dangerous sites are full of water 

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:09.640
 so quote is losing your christmas 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:11.610
 what makes us wonder 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.970
 because in the training of most of the heroes you learn to 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.490
 invoke beings of other dimensions and fight against undead mutants 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:24.620
 or giant monsters but they are not included in the swimming lessons xd 

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:30.280
 xd xd xd xd is rare but the heros survive large falls but not at 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.360
 water for example mario bros and those of the box 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.649
 the next one is 

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:36.330
 the final boss to the last 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:37.300
 it's curious 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:41.910
 you always start your adventure being a circus and level 1 shit you bring a 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:43.429
 wooden sword or kaka 

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:46.779
 home is located Spain together to make you stronger but you will never be 

00:01:46.779 --> 00:01:48.800
 it happens to dis that god of evil 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.399
 chief of darkness the invincible 

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:55.399
 or how the final boss in the fucking game confronts you from the sea 

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:56.639
 the beginning when 

00:01:56.639 --> 00:02:01.259
 you are a warrior apprentice and you better wait until you leave the level 99 and 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:05.450
 you're loaded to the balls with the best magic weapons and having met 

00:02:05.449 --> 00:02:10.140
 to your friends to help you practical example the patriarch of the knights 

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:11.109
 of the zodiac 

00:02:11.109 --> 00:02:14.870
 send his lower level warriors to finish with Seville and his 

00:02:14.869 --> 00:02:15.560
 friends 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.540
 but seeing that they only got stronger with the fights sends others from 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:21.959
 next level and so on 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:25.010
 when they arrive with him they are strong enough to 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:26.069
 defeat him 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:30.289
 the same goes at the beginning of castlevania circle of the moon 

00:02:30.289 --> 00:02:33.649
 Dracula kidnaps Vampire Slayer time and gets rid of 

00:02:33.649 --> 00:02:37.139
 inexperienced young people giving them an opportunity to improve their skills 

00:02:37.139 --> 00:02:43.239
 I already imagine what about it to berdych n right now we do not fight neko tour my 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:48.009
 castle and when they are stronger we already talked about how curious you are not able to 

00:02:48.009 --> 00:02:49.539
 cover 

00:02:49.539 --> 00:02:51.879
 the next curiosity that follows is 

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:53.969
 money from impossible characters 

00:02:53.969 --> 00:02:57.549
 well it is expected that with this it is understandable that one of the cattle is 

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:01.799
 resident evil 4 bring money to buy a pepsi brand soda 

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:07.590
 because bodies for pure toilet steal them in castlevania 64 you can 

00:03:07.589 --> 00:03:11.959
 eliminate ghosts that drop all kinds of objects that makes us 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:14.350
 think that if they are incorporeal beings 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:17.459
 so they can not hold anything because they are ectoplasm 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:20.529
 because they can bring a rifle or one up their sleeve 

00:03:20.529 --> 00:03:23.529
 although more curious curiosity no xd xd xd 

00:03:25.389 --> 00:03:27.519
 the following curiosities 

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:28.929
 you arrived early 

00:03:28.929 --> 00:03:32.609
 this curiosity is very good will put a lot of attention 

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:37.959
 normally you enter a place full of danger your puzzles puzzles asks 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:42.189
 more to be able to open the door is absolutely necessary and indispensable 

00:03:42.189 --> 00:03:46.779
 have an already see which one you get after eliminating the big bosses 

00:03:46.779 --> 00:03:50.290
 and join the corresponding pieces we go well not 

00:03:51.249 --> 00:03:54.629
 no one else could in any way enter that door without the key 

00:03:55.129 --> 00:03:59.599
 tipejos bulls without blood obtained then because in ditches to your friend 

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:01.299
 behind said door 

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:05.529
 this is seen a lot in resident evil, even though advancing in a fortress is 

00:04:05.529 --> 00:04:08.400
 practically impossible without getting the items 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:12.709
 always the key character goes further than you will always use 

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:15.759
 a bad helicopter to get to his lair 

00:04:15.759 --> 00:04:18.620
 xd xd xd xd xd xd 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:22.520
 they could not walk through their own headquarters if they had to go through the 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:26.020
 keys emblems shields and so on to open the doors do not believe 

00:04:26.779 --> 00:04:30.909
 it is curious to think that someone who had to go closing everything to leave ready 

00:04:30.909 --> 00:04:34.379
 the items for when the heroes venture to enter the castles and 

00:04:34.379 --> 00:04:36.500
 strengths what curious does not 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:41.030
 that is if then the final boss asks for a pizza he will have to go through the bosses 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:43.569
 look for items illanes emblems 

00:04:43.569 --> 00:04:49.349
 to be able to open the door xd xd xd xd xd xd good this is the first part 

00:04:49.349 --> 00:04:51.020
 I hope you enjoyed 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:55.160
 and if they have another curiosity is that we have not given public account and I gave 

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:56.400
 the comments 

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:57.040
 goodbye
