00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:07.170
 Well first of all 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:10.740
 There I was not used to that this time the split and the center 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:15.690
 That's what this is a model of Magred 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:17.820
 Hey that magnet is still the best part of the model is this blur adjustment 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:22.110
 You can do it by dialing 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:23.840
 Or from minimum zero to max this is a Kluwer throwing 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:25.570
 Headwind 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:30.880
 I want to spin 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:32.840
 It issued a distance or Toka adjusted with the place easily without Well of well myself I in response to this side 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.870
 You can do it right away 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:41.260
 so 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:46.780
 It is definitely an easy place to buy something that is the best in magnet 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:49.010
 Because you can set it with-without having to decide the setting of the brakes precisely 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.770
 Let's go to various conditions 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:56.520
 Bread and bread 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:59.110
 It is possible to change the setting next time and the drop is still overwhelming Arnet model 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.760
 There is a reason 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:02.590
 so 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.100
 Koch et al. I'tsu 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:08.470
 Not found 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:14.080
 This is a memorial to Aldebaran but this is a centrifuge 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:17.120
 It is Glock what is Tteyuu when the brakes of the here of salt Sea model say whether different from 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:21.470
 It Te small things go Tsukaa' 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:24.470
 Over no warrant centrifugal force by the spool rotates 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:28.420
 That 's a quick turn 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:33.540
 But is not suffering from the brake first branch by the centrifugal force is applied 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:38.700
 But I was most of the braking state when the loose rotation of the minute spool 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:41.690
 That 's why it's good when you 're comfortable and say it's soft and low on the trajectory 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:44.590
 There is an earthquake-proofer 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:46.380
 It is at release is can also survey 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:49.150
 However 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.970
 Impossible setting 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:54.390
 It is the best place 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:56.000
 Actually it is necessary that this 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.920
 Even though 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:04.170
 Crash if you have a Rheingau 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:09.179
 Or if it's too tight, it's a bit too tight and when it's pitching it's a thread that floats 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:12.460
 It the place just right in from being changed dramatically Tteyuu or may not out distance 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:13.660
 But it is where the most difficult stretch of'll 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:18.730
 Scolded do 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:20.750
 Well today yesterday to today's first held by the Bays Day Dark union 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:24.569
 I recommend the scene 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:29.760
 It is I want you to practice with the Rakuminami magnet 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:34.110
 And I want you to definitely remember this one more 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:39.160
 1 It's true with magnet brakes, but it's true with stretches too 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:40.610
 It is a my style this mechanical brake is not able to occupy the absolute 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:45.580
 That's right 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:49.990
 Create a temporary spoof below and have a good response 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:54.800
 Then carefully put on the bearing and put something good in it 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:57.370
 If you close the brake from the meeting and hold down the brake with a donation here 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:03:00.120
 It will be ruined 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:05.319
 The larger is 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:09.280
 It's amazing how much the spool turns, so don't dare to use him here 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:10.980
 It's a magnet brake or a centrifugal brake and it's a horse survey 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:15.540
 Yet to 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:21.540
 Or there is a thing that can say Is the people in the shrimp place to compensate 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:22.310
 In the case that Serve feeling well comfortably fly ball to reverse easier it is better not to use the mechanical brake 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.819
 Good 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:25.480
 this 

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:28.290
 Overwhelmingly throwing easy masu 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:28.290
 please remember
