interesting<00:00:16.650> to<00:00:16.680> see<00:00:16.859> where<00:00:17.010> that<00:00:17.100> heads<00:00:17.310> I've

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
interesting to see where that heads I've

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.910 
interesting to see where that heads I've
played<00:00:18.720> with<00:00:18.810> oculus<00:00:19.230> a<00:00:19.289> little<00:00:19.560> bit<00:00:19.680> and<00:00:19.800> I've

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
played with oculus a little bit and I've

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.560 
played with oculus a little bit and I've
heard<00:00:20.160> that<00:00:20.310> it's<00:00:20.520> just<00:00:20.609> getting<00:00:20.850> better<00:00:21.449> and

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
heard that it's just getting better and

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.540 
heard that it's just getting better and
better<00:00:21.779> like<00:00:22.109> by<00:00:22.350> the<00:00:22.410> day<00:00:22.970> and<00:00:24.019> so<00:00:25.019> I<00:00:25.550> think

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
better like by the day and so I think

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:27.859 
better like by the day and so I think
I'll<00:00:26.789> be<00:00:26.910> I<00:00:26.939> mean<00:00:27.060> they're<00:00:27.269> gonna<00:00:27.359> be<00:00:27.539> obvious

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
I'll be I mean they're gonna be obvious

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.060 
I'll be I mean they're gonna be obvious
choices<00:00:28.109> like<00:00:28.380> I'm<00:00:28.529> sure<00:00:28.680> there's<00:00:28.830> going<00:00:28.890> to

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
choices like I'm sure there's going to

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.740 
choices like I'm sure there's going to
be<00:00:29.099> a<00:00:29.160> first<00:00:29.400> person<00:00:29.519> shooter<00:00:29.730> made<00:00:30.150> for<00:00:30.630> it

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
be a first person shooter made for it

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.330 
be a first person shooter made for it
but<00:00:31.050> I've<00:00:31.650> heard<00:00:31.830> of<00:00:31.980> really<00:00:32.189> interesting

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
but I've heard of really interesting

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.040 
but I've heard of really interesting
experiments<00:00:33.090> people<00:00:33.329> are<00:00:33.390> already<00:00:33.540> doing

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
experiments people are already doing

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.860 
experiments people are already doing
with<00:00:34.320> the<00:00:34.410> oculus<00:00:34.559> where<00:00:35.130> they<00:00:35.309> am<00:00:35.489> I<00:00:35.780> wish<00:00:36.780> I

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
with the oculus where they am I wish I

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.750 
with the oculus where they am I wish I
can<00:00:36.960> remember<00:00:37.079> the<00:00:37.290> name<00:00:37.440> but<00:00:37.469> um<00:00:37.829> there<00:00:38.489> was<00:00:38.700> a

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
can remember the name but um there was a

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.540 
can remember the name but um there was a
group<00:00:39.450> that<00:00:39.690> made<00:00:39.930> kind<00:00:40.860> of<00:00:40.920> like<00:00:41.070> a<00:00:41.100> simulator

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
group that made kind of like a simulator

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.880 
group that made kind of like a simulator
so<00:00:41.820> people<00:00:42.570> opposite<00:00:43.050> genders<00:00:43.350> will<00:00:43.590> put<00:00:43.800> on

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
so people opposite genders will put on

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.500 
so people opposite genders will put on
the<00:00:43.920> oculus<00:00:44.100> and<00:00:44.700> they'll<00:00:44.910> see<00:00:45.180> the<00:00:45.210> other

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
the oculus and they'll see the other

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.029 
the oculus and they'll see the other
person's<00:00:45.719> feedback<00:00:46.289> so<00:00:46.559> they<00:00:46.680> if<00:00:46.890> you're<00:00:47.010> a

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
capture these days I'm a lot of the

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:24.649 
capture these days I'm a lot of the
figure<00:01:23.729> games<00:01:24.030> what<00:01:24.360> are<00:01:24.420> your<00:01:24.540> thoughts

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
figure games what are your thoughts

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.359 
figure games what are your thoughts
about<00:01:24.810> what<00:01:25.110> that<00:01:25.229> opens<00:01:25.650> up<00:01:25.740> to<00:01:25.920> actors<00:01:26.250> like

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
about what that opens up to actors like

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.609 
about what that opens up to actors like
yourself<00:01:26.790> well<00:01:27.750> yeah<00:01:28.049> that's<00:01:28.320> gonna<00:01:28.439> be

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
yourself well yeah that's gonna be

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.289 
yourself well yeah that's gonna be
really<00:01:28.740> interesting<00:01:29.340> I<00:01:29.820> think<00:01:30.090> it's<00:01:30.180> gonna

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
really interesting I think it's gonna

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.149 
really interesting I think it's gonna
add<00:01:30.450> a<00:01:30.479> lot<00:01:30.659> to<00:01:30.720> performances<00:01:31.290> like<00:01:31.619> if<00:01:31.979> you

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
add a lot to performances like if you
