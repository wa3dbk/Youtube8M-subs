00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
are bad pass defenses he had a nice

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.140

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
30-something yard run last week so he's

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:39.339 
30-something yard run last week so he's
getting<00:02:38.390> a<00:02:38.420> little<00:02:38.599> more<00:02:38.870> involved<00:02:39.049> in<00:02:39.260> the

00:02:39.339 --> 00:02:39.349 
getting a little more involved in the

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:41.830 
getting a little more involved in the
offense<00:02:39.709> and<00:02:39.889> he<00:02:39.980> is<00:02:40.370> just<00:02:40.400> a<00:02:40.970> Hall<00:02:41.510> of<00:02:41.540> Fame

talent<00:02:42.379> so<00:02:42.590> I<00:02:42.829> don't<00:02:43.250> think<00:02:43.370> we<00:02:43.459> can<00:02:43.549> white<00:02:44.060> put

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
talent so I don't think we can white put

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:45.670 
talent so I don't think we can white put
the<00:02:44.659> fork<00:02:44.930> in<00:02:45.079> there<00:02:45.230> even<00:02:45.349> though<00:02:45.530> I've<00:02:45.650> been
