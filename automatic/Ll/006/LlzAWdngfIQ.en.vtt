I<00:03:03.040> can<00:03:04.040> relate<00:03:04.340> to<00:03:04.580> where<00:03:05.239> I<00:03:05.269> came<00:03:05.390> over<00:03:05.720> the

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:05.840 
I can relate to where I came over the

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.289 
I can relate to where I came over the
ice<00:03:05.989> I<00:03:06.349> can<00:03:06.560> I<00:03:06.860> can<00:03:07.040> enjoy<00:03:07.400> every<00:03:08.090> movement

00:03:08.289 --> 00:03:08.299 
ice I can I can enjoy every movement

00:03:12.039 --> 00:03:12.049 
that I could love the ice and again it's

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:15.039 
that I could love the ice and again it's
it's<00:03:12.590> because<00:03:13.579> of<00:03:13.730> Salim<00:03:14.120> and<00:03:14.269> step<00:03:14.569> on<00:03:14.780> that

00:03:15.039 --> 00:03:15.049 
it's because of Salim and step on that

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:17.380 
it's because of Salim and step on that
because<00:03:15.170> the<00:03:15.530> work<00:03:16.129> that<00:03:16.370> we<00:03:16.489> did<00:03:16.670> if<00:03:17.120> they

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:17.390 
because the work that we did if they

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:21.880 
because the work that we did if they
really<00:03:18.260> made<00:03:18.560> me<00:03:18.739> realize<00:03:18.950> how<00:03:20.079> much<00:03:21.079> I<00:03:21.440> can

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:21.890 
really made me realize how much I can

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:24.569 
really made me realize how much I can
actually<00:03:22.069> do<00:03:22.430> with<00:03:22.640> myself<00:03:23.140> with<00:03:24.140> that<00:03:24.319> mean

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:24.579 
actually do with myself with that mean

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:31.000
