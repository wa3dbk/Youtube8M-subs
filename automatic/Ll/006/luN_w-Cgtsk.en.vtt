00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:38.780 
like a little bit force field and like

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:42.670 
like a little bit force field and like
you<00:03:38.989> could<00:03:39.230> see<00:03:39.470> and<00:03:39.709> I<00:03:41.110> have<00:03:42.110> a<00:03:42.140> damage<00:03:42.500> zone

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:42.680 
you could see and I have a damage zone

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:45.100 
you could see and I have a damage zone
so<00:03:42.890> that's<00:03:43.100> pretty<00:03:43.310> dopey<00:03:43.700> because<00:03:44.060> I<00:03:44.360> think<00:03:44.959> I

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:45.110 
so that's pretty dopey because I think I

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:48.220 
so that's pretty dopey because I think I
can<00:03:45.290> kill<00:03:45.500> almost<00:03:46.310> everyone<00:03:47.090> except<00:03:47.870> if<00:03:48.019> they

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:48.230 
can kill almost everyone except if they

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:52.660 
can kill almost everyone except if they
have<00:03:48.410> a<00:03:48.440> lot<00:03:48.650> of<00:03:48.680> armor<00:03:49.130> and<00:03:50.890> so<00:03:51.890> now<00:03:52.340> it's
