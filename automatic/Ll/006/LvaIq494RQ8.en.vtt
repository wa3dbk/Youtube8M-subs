00:07:58.380 --> 00:07:58.390 
when you have those press conferences

00:07:58.390 --> 00:08:00.510 
when you have those press conferences
often<00:07:58.840> people<00:07:58.930> do<00:07:59.170> say<00:07:59.710> mean<00:08:00.130> things<00:08:00.160> to<00:08:00.400> each

00:08:00.510 --> 00:08:00.520 
often people do say mean things to each

00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:03.090

00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:05.710 
I think the sensible thing would be to

00:08:05.710 --> 00:08:07.770 
I think the sensible thing would be to
go<00:08:05.860> in<00:08:06.040> and<00:08:06.250> say<00:08:06.460> hi<00:08:06.790> I'm<00:08:07.030> a<00:08:07.060> big<00:08:07.330> fan<00:08:07.540> of<00:08:07.660> your
