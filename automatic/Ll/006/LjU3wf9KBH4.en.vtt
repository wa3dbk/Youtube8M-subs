all right so on the on the the the

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:11.929 
all right so on the on the the the
record<00:01:10.680> is<00:01:10.829> prepped<00:01:11.100> quite<00:01:11.369> quick<00:01:11.640> and<00:01:11.850> it's

like

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:17.110 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:19.620 

I<00:01:18.030> find<00:01:19.030> when<00:01:19.180> you're<00:01:19.300> playing<00:01:19.480> it

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:19.630 
I find when you're playing it

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:21.000 
I find when you're playing it
acoustically<00:01:20.140> you<00:01:20.230> can<00:01:20.380> slow<00:01:20.590> it<00:01:20.620> down<00:01:20.740> a<00:01:20.860> bit

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:21.010 
acoustically you can slow it down a bit

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:23.070 
acoustically you can slow it down a bit
and<00:01:21.250> you<00:01:21.400> don't<00:01:21.580> want<00:01:22.300> the<00:01:22.360> strums<00:01:22.690> to<00:01:22.900> ring

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:23.080 
and you don't want the strums to ring

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:25.470 
and you don't want the strums to ring
out<00:01:23.170> a<00:01:23.230> little<00:01:23.380> bit<00:01:23.590> I<00:01:23.740> think<00:01:23.860> so<00:01:24.820> I<00:01:24.850> tend<00:01:25.270> to<00:01:25.330> do

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:25.480 
out a little bit I think so I tend to do

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:29.910 
out a little bit I think so I tend to do
it<00:01:25.630> down<00:01:26.640> just<00:01:27.640> on<00:01:27.850> the<00:01:28.000> bottom<00:01:28.780> three<00:01:29.110> down

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:29.920 
it down just on the bottom three down

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:36.780 
it down just on the bottom three down
and<00:01:30.340> then<00:01:30.640> a<00:01:30.670> fool

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:36.790 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:39.210 

quickly<00:01:37.690> just<00:01:37.750> hitting<00:01:38.140> the<00:01:38.230> base<00:01:38.470> in<00:01:38.800> between

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:39.220 
quickly just hitting the base in between

00:01:39.220 --> 00:02:00.679 
quickly just hitting the base in between
full<00:01:39.460> strands

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.389
