thought<00:01:29.509> was<00:01:29.600> a<00:01:29.630> neat<00:01:29.810> way<00:01:29.929> to<00:01:29.990> break<00:01:30.289> it<00:01:30.439> up

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560 
thought was a neat way to break it up

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:38.969 
thought was a neat way to break it up
and<00:01:30.770> said<00:01:30.950> it's<00:01:31.100> going<00:01:31.399> like<00:01:31.549> this<00:01:31.850> twice

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:38.979 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:58.800 

it<00:01:39.729> works<00:01:39.969> like<00:01:40.090> an<00:01:40.240> 8<00:01:40.479> right<00:01:40.689> by<00:01:40.930> a<00:01:40.960> minor<00:01:41.320> to<00:01:41.560> G

00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:58.810 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.410 

that's<00:01:59.810> a<00:01:59.869> pretty<00:02:00.049> cool<00:02:00.229> pattern<00:02:01.420> right

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.420 
that's a pretty cool pattern right

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.810
