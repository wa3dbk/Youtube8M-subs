00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:17.700
 hello to all of you will give 13 and today 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:22.619
 Our guest is a very unusual plant and 

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:24.900
 namely pt 9 level america t95 for many 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.619
 players different impressions about this 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.520
 aggregate 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:32.040
 Someone thinks that t95 is a piece of shit 

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:34.829
 which should be thrown out of the game for a long time 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:38.540
 here and vice versa prefers to ride on 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:40.680
 such an ambiguous machine that is 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:44.070
 feel something new agree 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.820
 what's in the game now more rollt good 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.820
 tool 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:50.899
 good speed and armor is not particularly 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:53.519
 need but on t95 we have just a little bit 

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:56.750
 back in those old days when 

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:59.910
 armor still pulled and when it was possible 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:03.390
 vytalkovyvat here is someone riding on 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:05.190
 Maus and someone rides on T95 personally, I 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.710
 probably treat the players who 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:12.360
 still enjoys driving 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:16.530
 on this machine based i don't have 95 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:19.160
 unfortunately but on the test server I 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.930
 dragged all new f-shki 

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:25.010
 Germany decided to ride after all 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:28.610
 several fights on 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:32.480
 t95 and therefore my impressions 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:34.490
 left very good first brought 

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:37.550
 again relieves stress very well 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:39.680
 is after the working day so let's say 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:42.200
 he is not working for me yet he is more 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:45.860
 such an academic year that is after all 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:48.260
 my affairs after school and classes 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:51.650
 I come home and you just know 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:53.690
 I relax I go into battle, you can 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:55.960
 even put a little better graphics 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:58.940
 have put all settings on 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:01.729
 maximum level and calm 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:03.920
 relax enjoy nature 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:07.250
 especially well, not especially, but rather 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:10.100
 you cards such more relief and 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:13.540
 or even more forest that is you 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:19.340
 you go quietly and your eye is resting 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:23.360
 there comes a time of serenity and after 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:27.020
 such a hard day is what you need here 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:30.860
 but also besides this can not be taken away 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:33.080
 game quality in this Fri despite 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:35.840
 the fact that speed is not catastrophic for us 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:38.180
 enough 95 shows very good 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:40.820
 results when we find competent 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:44.840
 There is a lot of position in the game 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:48.260
 now tanks tanks that depend on 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:51.590
 positions and that's just American 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:54.610
 fri-shka this turtle fits 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:58.010
 this classification is very very good 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:03:01.820
 player with a nickname steel turtle apparently 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:04.790
 This player is not the first time riding tanks 

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:07.040
 with good armor shows us 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:10.280
 wonderful position on the pass map 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:12.410
 without going far from the base just drove 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:14.900
 up on a hill and it turns out so 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:16.970
 the enemies themselves approach him that is to us 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:19.959
 there is no need to hurry and this is the most 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:24.440
 The main maximum speed is not 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:27.800
 different as a good figure of 95 then 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:29.330
 eat in a straight line do 13 per hour hold 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:32.050
 max speed but by the way 13 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:35.440
 95 kilometers straight confident and 

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:38.800
 because no matter what but 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:42.100
 if you have to go back to 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:44.860
 base let's say for shooting down capture you don't 

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:49.570
 have time of course and generally worth it 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:54.520
 keep the enemies at a distance here but in 

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:57.310
 the whole bug is just a great car 

00:03:54.520 --> 00:04:00.220
 which can entertain you 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:03.430
 someone else loves bochata for his 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:05.920
 speed but sometimes I personally 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:07.450
 get wild pleasure from tanks with 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:09.910
 good armor and 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:13.200
 from tanks that are not enough 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:16.090
 speed for quick flag change 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:18.220
 and so your impressions told you 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:20.680
 by the way at the beginning I didn’t even know what 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:23.790
 heading is better to put this 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:27.090
 This video because it seems to be about the record 

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:29.920
 he is not talking about me just like that 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:32.050
 atmospheric sketch about 305 

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:33.970
 but in spite of everything I chose very much 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:37.450
 a good fight 

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:41.350
 on the pass here we have a steel player 

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:43.600
 the turtle that hit the top and again 

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:46.480
 here shows us a good position like me 

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:49.810
 already said in terms of what the players do not 

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:52.980
 charge up here can't surround 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:56.650
 somehow our hero and hence this 

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:59.140
 what you need in any case if you 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:03.490
 take the right position on t95 then 

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:05.590
 this fri-shka becomes not just some 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:08.080
 gaming machine and probably a bunker or 

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:09.720
 fortress here is a steel wall and in general 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:12.490
 with steel skull from and 

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:17.860
 but now it is already coming 

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:19.990
 the whole thing to the denouement of the battle 9 frags player 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:21.970
 and therefore it remains to finish off the object 

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:24.370
 704 and is a 6 

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:27.580
 it would seem simple but hp something wrong 

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:29.919
 too much 704 is dangerous 

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:32.050
 for the hotel 105 now have of course 

00:05:29.919 --> 00:05:36.370
 pick and sashi table and in order for it 

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:38.530
 already in the background did not even bother us yet 

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:40.780
 it remains to make one shot and then 

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:44.590
 already deal with object 704 

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:46.720
 in terms of what I said before 

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:50.919
 Some players consider 395 the most 

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:53.199
 defective tank I’m ready to absolutely not 

00:05:50.919 --> 00:05:57.630
 agree not only because 

00:05:53.199 --> 00:06:00.460
 I personally have sympathy but also because 

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:03.460
 if that so really was complete 

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:05.590
 there wouldn't be a lot of shit on wotreplays 

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:07.539
 replays believe it the best 

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:09.240
 indicators to be shown in 

00:06:07.539 --> 00:06:13.690
 this video 

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:16.300
 there were some more good replays there 

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:18.070
 everywhere there for 10 thousand damage and even 

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:20.199
 there are more than twelve thousand damage 

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:22.780
 but I decided to choose or on this replay 

00:06:20.199 --> 00:06:25.599
 because not standard shown here 

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:29.169
 position personally I was surprised that 

00:06:25.599 --> 00:06:33.969
 get to play such a productive 

00:06:29.169 --> 00:06:36.400
 fight without departing from the box office as they say here 

00:06:33.969 --> 00:06:38.259
 the player drove away very close and in the end 

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:40.180
 everything turned out very very elegant 

00:06:38.259 --> 00:06:42.280
 by the way if you notice 

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:45.520
 on chat then 

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:47.500
 steel turtle probably still 

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:52.000
 man so i will say what he wrote in 

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:56.770
 chat about what 7 thousand battles seem already 

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:58.840
 played on t95 and of course the player is already 

00:06:56.770 --> 00:07:01.479
 understands all the pros and cons of the weak and 

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:04.150
 strengths of this unit and so 

00:07:01.479 --> 00:07:06.789
 the video is coming to the end with you was gaz-13 

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:09.639
 I hope, you 

00:07:06.789 --> 00:07:10.630
 solidarity with my point of view to all 

00:07:09.639 --> 00:07:13.919
 successful bend 

00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:13.919
 and all bye
