 puerto rico 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.190

 many lan parties with plenty 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.530

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:10.200
 I can tell at that time yes and in general 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:12.330
 sometimes when I didn't have classes in 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.040
 college I came to a small house john 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.200
 and where he lived and we came off there all 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.060
 night playing video games we always had 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.040
 installed several computers because 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.810
 we loved lan parties and somehow we 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.939
 got to the party where was 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.250
 about 15 computers installed 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:28.770
 15-20 people played at the same time 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.600
 at the same time and it was very simple 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.390
 chic just impressive 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.490
 we had just gorgeous nights gorgeous 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.230
 but numbers but in parties we are constantly 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.540
 looked at the dreamhack 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:43.520
 you can only imagine it 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:50.150
 how cool would be on dreamhack and now 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:53.420

 following this summer's okay well you straight 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:03.580

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:06.320
 pounds we have a lot of stories jay 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:07.970
 we have a lot of common stories but 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:10.220
 some stories i just can't 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:13.340

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:15.380

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:18.260
 but well how about this story this 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:19.459
 also can not be well and I agree there 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.590
 there was a complete tin 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:23.600
 but I have a story with which everything is in 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:26.540
 okay, I don't think he heard that before 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:27.800
 this story and she was i was working in 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.930
 flights at the airport 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:32.840
 you probably already know what worked in 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:36.020
 many airlines worked in service 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.070
 worked in tower airlines worked even in 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:39.980
 american airlines 

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:42.410
 well, there was a Tomsk cap but here it is small 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:45.890
 breakaway when worked in yasiar lines I'm on 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:50.750
 actually broke those liters that you 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:52.850
 broke I broke broke those body liters 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:56.420
 Trump is the kind of tunnel that leads to 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:58.760
 the plane I broke it dude nobody 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:00.920
 knows it was a secret it's time it 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.660
 reveal me as usual waiting for the aircraft 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:04.549
 you know there are buttons in this trap body 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:07.070
 controls forward back left right 

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:09.410
 the tunnel was moving left right up down 

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:11.630
 something like this well, in general, we waited for the arrival 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:13.910
 the plane and i decided to play around with the body 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:17.000
 trails I pressed the button and he jumped 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:20.299
 up i was happy and i will continue and and 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:25.400
 press continued press see what I 

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:29.510
 I can 5 liters began to jump higher 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:31.700
 and above I am our kind and quite unexpectedly 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:35.799
 he stopped working I continued 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:35.799
 press the button but nothing happened 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:42.710
 so he moved left and right 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:44.840
 he could move left and right but not 

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:52.820
 up and down and at this moment flies 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:55.700
 plane dude plane was taller than those 

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:58.460
 liters I could not do anything in the body 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:00.530
 trails I was just in a panic i was barely 

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:02.480
 put it on the plane with movements 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:06.230
 left and right I tried to present 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:08.209
 we opened the door to them and you know 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:10.370
 man we had to help everyone 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:12.830
 the passenger jump the plane onto those 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:16.040
 liters the height difference was just 

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:18.680
 awesome and we had to help everyone 

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:22.970
 passenger to pilot and steward 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:27.800
 and we kept it secret no one knew 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:29.510
 about this until this day oh man oh yeah 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:31.790
 broke it you know i'm back on 

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:32.840
 the next day he was repaired and he 

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:35.540
 someone already repaired 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:38.570
 and it's really cool you scare me 

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:41.919
 eat my husband I will have problems well you 

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:45.650
 you know i'm pretty sure it's ok 

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:47.960
 almost sure I think something like that 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:53.090
 It was to happen to you it does not 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:55.180
 I worked but someone will fix it and not worth it 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:57.580
 play with expensive equipment 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:05:00.890
 especially at airports 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:03.740
 Here is the lesson I learned yes I think 

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:05.300
 extracted you can play around a little 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:07.580
 electrical equipment 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:09.800
 but she can suddenly sprales and jerky 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:11.240
 j actually there is another story again 

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:13.669
 at the airport one of the craziest 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:15.740
 stories that happened to me 

00:05:13.669 --> 00:05:17.840
 you know what i think i think some of the most 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:19.610
 crazy stuff happens at the airport 

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:21.470
 because I know so much there 

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:23.870
 different cultures of people and they all 

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:25.060
 are in the same place you know i was 

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:27.310
 witness the world and 

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:29.650
 their events I gave out tickets worked with 

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:31.840
 baggage and at checkpoints well in 

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:34.240
 Generally at the moment when I worked on that 

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:36.010
 the place where the tickets are processed I stood on 

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:38.200
 the place where they are given to the passenger and 

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:39.970
 I saw someone rushing past me and 

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:42.910
 then saw a whole crowd of guards 

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:45.040
 who rushed him stop him 

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:46.840
 I asked what the hell it was later 

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:48.340
 some time we saw how it 

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:50.230
 arrested and taken back to 

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:51.970
 checkpoint later I found out that 

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:53.620
 it happened because everyone was talking about it 

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:55.900
 at the airport we all wanted to know about it 

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:58.900
 and so what happened it was someone who 

00:05:55.900 --> 00:06:00.940
 illegally came from and he is cunning 

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:03.370
 used checkpoint mechanics 

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:05.110
 to go through it man it was 

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:07.240
 one of the coolest things is that he 

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:09.160
 did when you go through 

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:11.229
 check point you must show 

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:14.710
 your ticket and usually there is someone who 

00:06:11.229 --> 00:06:16.570
 ask and where you are flying as usual 

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:18.490
 check you know all the emigrants from 

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:20.440
 give them similar questions and tries 

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:22.450
 make sure their ticket goes exactly where 

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:24.910
 they talk and the guy said i'm flying 

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:26.620
 where was he really my boyfriend 

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:29.740
 on the check point you said well 

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:31.990
 you can go and as soon as he 

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:35.640
 passed through the check point he took 

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:37.930
 your ticket in and vomited it 

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:40.600
 then he got another ticket in 

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:43.330
 new york in the delta from and someone from 

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:43.840
 airline staff saw how he did it 

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:46.120
 does 

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:48.250
 they approached asked and for some reason broke 

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:50.229
 your ticket this guy just broke with 

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:52.510
 places and ran they caught him and he 

00:06:50.229 --> 00:06:54.460
 admitted that his friend is already on the plane and 

00:06:52.510 --> 00:07:00.729
 that they should take it too 

00:06:54.460 --> 00:07:02.440
 and they tied up his friend too one of 

00:07:00.729 --> 00:07:04.590
 the smartest use of mechanics 

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:08.320
 failed because of his friend 

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:11.220
 he met us for his friend jade and 

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:13.539
 I never heard this story because not 

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:17.979
 may have heard but not completely 

00:07:13.539 --> 00:07:22.000
 house sounded her friend yes he 

00:07:17.979 --> 00:07:25.590
 sounded hope you enjoyed this 

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.590
 story see you next
