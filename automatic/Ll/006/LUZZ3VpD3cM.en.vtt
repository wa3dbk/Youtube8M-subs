00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:18.540
 hey people today i will give you the tic 

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:18.540
 show tac 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:24.290
 antic day use the wall or one 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:26.090
 wall or something but I reject it 

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:27.830
 and as far as possible or high to the 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:31.279
 opposite wall or exciting 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:32.840
 obstacle course to jump at the ticket 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:34.670
 would have to make sure that you first 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:37.160
 focused on the jump and not 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:38.870
 to the destination where you wanted to land otherwise 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.400
 It can easily happen that you are 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:41.510
 can not really push away because you 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:43.220
 already too far away with that 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:45.290
 upper body of the wall you have to 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:46.519
 really nice to get stuck in to the wall 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:48.199
 So you put pressure on the wall 

00:00:46.519 --> 00:00:53.000
 can bring and finish well 

00:00:48.199 --> 00:00:55.010
 if you can with your foot against the 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.260
 You take the wall from below with the wall 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:58.730
 poor momentum when you push off 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:01.640
 from the wall at the same time pulls the 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:03.940
 arms up in the direction where you 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:03.940
 jump 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:10.399
 in the downswing phase is very important 

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:13.100
 that we are with the full power on the 

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:15.200
 wall to run and with the upper body 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.640
 you're better off with it 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.310
 could really push you out 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.960
 and yes pressure against the wall gets if 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:22.909
 you are already too far away from the wall 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.500
 and you with the upper body already too 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:26.810
 very oriented in the direction where you 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.789
 you do not want to jump 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:30.590
 Strong imprint more on the wall bump 

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:32.840
 I always with the foot from closer to 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.069
 the wall is so if you are the wall 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:37.759
 right next to you have from erich 

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:39.080
 conclusion you take the right foot if 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:43.159
 she is not the one to your left 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:44.810
 left foot the faster here on the 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:46.429
 wall to run before you jump off all the more 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.819
 You can get stronger from the wall too 

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:51.079
 so the more power you have 

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:52.489
 But take care that we are the right one 

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:53.810
 timing you have faster you are 

00:01:52.489 --> 00:01:56.119
 our players are on the right track 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:58.340
 timing to find so in the beginning rather 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:59.299
 slower and yes if it's really good 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.590
 you can already have it 

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:02.000
 faster to go to the wall than 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.770
 practice for the tick tack is good 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.239
 if you already go up the wall 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:07.009
 I can do that too 

00:02:05.239 --> 00:02:08.390
 made tutorial and as you learn, we 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:09.920
 the wall goes really nice 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:14.209
 So we push you up on the 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:16.310
 Wand as a first step for the tic tac 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:19.100
 just look straight or wall 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:20.780
 Wall house wall or something and 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:22.459
 tried to pull the trigger because you always 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.440
 and at a certain point 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:25.069
 land from tastes it always on 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:29.280
 to go 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:32.030
 for example here so line on the floor 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.030
 and always ensure long 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:52.540
 a second exercise for the call of 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:55.700
 the wall and the landing 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:56.569
 first look for a wall to the 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.610
 you hang on 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:59.930
 turn away and turn around in the air 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:01.790
 and try on a certain point 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:04.930
 to land on tomorrow the mark the 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:04.930
 you made yourselves on the ground 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:20.400
 At some point you can try it too 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:21.840
 open wall or on any 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.920
 obstacle course to jump or one 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.920
 to jump in the second wall 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:31.160
 for the second step of tic tac would be 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:31.730
 It's good if your precision jump already 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.620
 granted 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:38.120
 I also have tutorial for that 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:40.010
 made if you step one and 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:41.510
 Step two individually then you can 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:44.180
 he tries to combine both 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:46.099
 look for two walls next to each other 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:48.560
 you express yourself from the one and 

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:50.269
 jump to the second run or search 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:51.800
 you just wall where next to any 

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:53.660
 small obstacle is where you on it 

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:56.420
 for example, stairs could land 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:58.250
 like that and try your luck from the wall 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:00.580
 Press and on the obstacle 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:00.580
 land 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:07.040
 I hope I could help you 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:08.240
 with the tutorial if you like it 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:10.220
 have'm thumbs up 

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:11.600
 if you want to see more tutorials 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:13.850
 I subscribe to the main channel 

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:15.140
 upload new ones if you are 

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:17.120
 Any more questions about the trick 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:18.560
 have me write comments like then 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:20.510
 I try to answer that way 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:21.829
 fast as possible otherwise first 

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:24.220
 Have fun while exercising and until 

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:24.220
 next time
