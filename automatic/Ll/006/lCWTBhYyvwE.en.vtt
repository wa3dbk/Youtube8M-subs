00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:06.330
 beauty talks to you 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.910
 I 'm the one who sends today I'm going to teach 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.190
 how do you increase how to make a 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:15.150
 memory upgrade as add more 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:17.039
 memory in another book please 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.529
 watch this video because the 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.600
 procedure is quite different even from a 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:24.119
 procedure of a notebook if you 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.380
 Do the same notebook you can ruin 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.810
 your job 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.429
 so let's go there first the question is 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.099
 the ultrabook can not remove the 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.630
 battery is then before performing the 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:37.260
 memory upgrade you will have to 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:39.930
 locate in the manual or housing that 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.000
 looking the same where the 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.860
 power interruption 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.480
 The second issue is that not all 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.840
 work that allows an upgrade of 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.850
 memory this here is a samsung allows 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:53.370
 and the third issue is that not every brand 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.399
 allows you to see in the manual of your 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:59.460
 brand if it teaches increase memory 

00:00:55.399 --> 00:01:01.559
 if it allows because some brands 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.870
 generally the smaller brands they do not 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:06.960
 let's put sealing things like 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:09.900
 big brands like hp lenovo dell 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.369
 samsung does not have much problem with this 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.170
 you can see that Samsung not 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:16.110
 has any type of seal equal to those 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.180
 is that the personnel puts it in a 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.130
 computer steps and do not open the product 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.240
 then we will use this as the 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.549
 procedure 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.340
 Since you can not remove the battery, you can 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:28.170
 you will need to stop feeding 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:32.430
 will not damage the motherboard and the 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:34.079
 memory picks up a toothpick a clip and 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.860
 here in the hole until you feel 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:40.409
 button felt tightened the power 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.939
 interrupted as we will have 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.220
 sure that the food was 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:48.180
 interrupted after pressing the 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:50.390
 People are going to open another book and try to call 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.390
 it 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:54.520
 He's not calling, so he means 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:56.880
 that was the interrupted feeding 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:02:00.190
 successfully 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:02.800
 Now we can open the lid. 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:05.700
 to put the new comb on. 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:05.700
 open here 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:26.150
 Now I'll have to drop the camera one 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:31.959
 little to lift the cover needs 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:31.959
 pulling on both sides is a little annoying 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:44.010
 good continuing 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:46.200
 So we have a hd here, right? 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:48.629
 easy access gives even to clean and stay 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:54.390
 here and here the memory has even the 

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:58.319
 the instructions we upgrading 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:03:03.269
 now let's keep track of which are 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:07.170
 instructions here interrupt the 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:09.930
 battery power is 12 to raise the 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:10.890
 Tag ticking is important to be 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:15.209
 folks 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:16.889
 it is issues of when you have 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:19.290
 from Thursday we'll see if you have a tip 

00:03:16.889 --> 00:03:24.290
 chrome so it blocks the issue of 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:27.290
 interference from the memory with the 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:27.290
 mom 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:39.110
 so we will raise 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:41.590
 Let's open here, then, source of the 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:41.590
 memory 

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:51.120
 You can see that it's stuck. I'll have to 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:53.610
 stop filming again to pull the 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:57.990
 Ribbon can not remove tape only 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:04:00.470
 School is ok, I'm holding the 

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:00.470
 ribbon 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:05.640
 I'll take the memory comb you always 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:08.580
 go get a comb and look at two things 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:12.780
 first do not touch or new black chips 

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:15.000
 is always on the sides and second 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:17.160
 Aquino through the pent has not risquinho 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
 It's a cut that's for you, you know the side. 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:20.640
 right 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:25.410
 then you will align this cut with the 

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:27.420
 right side here on the motherboard is in the 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:29.550
 Right side you put it on me leaning 

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:32.000
 so go down by threading it 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:32.000
 time 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:48.430
 Okay, I'll turn the camera off again. 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:48.430
 because you need both hands 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:56.450
 Okay, so it's you laid leaning 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:59.030
 lowering and inserting the same comb 

00:04:56.450 --> 00:05:01.370
 Time, time, you have nothing to lower. 

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:03.260
 You finish putting it on. 

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:04.850
 be right on the latches it will fit 

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:08.960
 perfectly 

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:12.530
 then just put again this also 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:15.590
 here she is important is for questions 

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:19.370
 of interference like I did not say fit 

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:23.080
 everything is done and your anp greide 

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:25.790
 memory then remembering that the trebuchet 

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:28.370
 interrupted the battery 

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:31.160
 yesterday interrupt the battery metaphor 

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:34.670
 so there will not do you're going 

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:35.780
 burn your memory is a motherboard open 

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:38.060
 the lid is not 

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:40.220
 usually do the 

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:44.450
 always remember not to 

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:45.470
 playing on the black chips is always by 

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:49.760
 sides 

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:53.270
 the memory line or cut with the slot 

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:55.850
 memory and put beauty is this 

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:58.070
 I hope you have enjoyed it and a 

00:05:55.850 --> 00:06:00.140
 another book will only come back to work 

00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:02.390
 now when you plug it in the power is 

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:03.950
 the battery will only be revived when 

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:06.860
 turn on the power 

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:08.870
 for now it will not work just the 

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:09.650
 time to put energy that unlocks 

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:12.880
 drums 

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:12.880
 a hug thanks
