the<00:00:09.420> map<00:00:09.599> hijacked<00:00:10.170> which<00:00:10.469> is<00:00:10.679> a<00:00:10.860> very<00:00:11.309> tiny

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
the map hijacked which is a very tiny

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.150 
the map hijacked which is a very tiny
map<00:00:11.940> it's<00:00:12.210> very<00:00:12.990> similar<00:00:13.320> to<00:00:13.440> something<00:00:13.799> like

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
map it's very similar to something like

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.810 
map it's very similar to something like
nuketown<00:00:14.849> 2025<00:00:15.030> or<00:00:16.430> almost<00:00:17.430> if<00:00:17.580> you<00:00:17.670> could

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
nuketown 2025 or almost if you could

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.500 
nuketown 2025 or almost if you could
condense<00:00:18.270> a<00:00:19.189> meltdown<00:00:20.189> or<00:00:20.609> aftermath<00:00:21.180> down

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
condense a meltdown or aftermath down

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.590 
condense a meltdown or aftermath down
its<00:00:21.779> you<00:00:22.050> know<00:00:22.199> squish<00:00:22.529> it<00:00:22.680> it's<00:00:22.859> still<00:00:23.160> a<00:00:23.340> big

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:23.600 
its you know squish it it's still a big

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.529 
its you know squish it it's still a big
rectangle<00:00:24.600> but<00:00:24.840> and<00:00:25.170> there's<00:00:25.769> two<00:00:25.949> sides<00:00:26.130> but

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:26.539 
rectangle but and there's two sides but

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:29.269 
rectangle but and there's two sides but
it's<00:00:27.539> also<00:00:27.750> tiny<00:00:28.170> but<00:00:28.650> you<00:00:28.710> still<00:00:28.920> have<00:00:29.070> like

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
it's also tiny but you still have like

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:30.800 
it's also tiny but you still have like
the<00:00:29.429> three<00:00:29.609> lanes<00:00:29.820> it's<00:00:30.000> hard<00:00:30.210> to<00:00:30.269> explain<00:00:30.449> but

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
the three lanes it's hard to explain but

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.900 
the three lanes it's hard to explain but
it's<00:00:31.109> actually<00:00:31.560> a<00:00:31.980> really<00:00:32.219> really<00:00:32.399> fun<00:00:32.520> map

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910

playing something like free-for-all

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.900 
playing something like free-for-all
spawns<00:00:36.899> can<00:00:37.230> get<00:00:37.890> really<00:00:38.129> really<00:00:38.370> crazy<00:00:38.610> on

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
spawns can get really really crazy on

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.660 
spawns can get really really crazy on
both<00:00:39.120> ends<00:00:39.329> of<00:00:39.510> the<00:00:39.540> boat<00:00:40.379> also<00:00:41.309> you<00:00:41.370> need<00:00:41.550> to

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
balconies they can look at the spawns

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.160 
balconies they can look at the spawns
they<00:00:45.149> can<00:00:45.270> look<00:00:45.360> at<00:00:45.480> the<00:00:45.600> center<00:00:45.809> of<00:00:45.870> the<00:00:45.989> map

the<00:00:59.309> map<00:00:59.489> is<00:00:59.730> it's<00:01:00.510> very<00:01:00.629> balanced<00:01:01.199> you<00:01:01.530> have

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
the map is it's very balanced you have

both sides to the map it's one of my

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.479 
both sides to the map it's one of my
more<00:01:03.870> favorite<00:01:03.930> maps<00:01:04.379> even<00:01:04.769> though<00:01:04.890> it<00:01:05.040> is<00:01:05.070> as

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
more favorite maps even though it is as

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.149 
more favorite maps even though it is as

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
small as that is a little bit of

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:09.679 
small as that is a little bit of
gameplay<00:01:08.430> for<00:01:08.729> you<00:01:08.850> may<00:01:09.210> just<00:01:09.390> play<00:01:09.510> the

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
objective here on domination this is a

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.289 
objective here on domination this is a
linear<00:01:12.930> map<00:01:13.200> it<00:01:13.710> goes<00:01:13.890> ABC<00:01:14.490> in<00:01:14.729> a<00:01:14.909> straight

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
linear map it goes ABC in a straight

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.390 
linear map it goes ABC in a straight
line<00:01:15.560> generally<00:01:16.560> you're<00:01:16.680> going<00:01:16.830> to<00:01:16.890> have<00:01:17.040> a<00:01:17.070> or

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
line generally you're going to have a or

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:18.830 
line generally you're going to have a or
C<00:01:17.610> and<00:01:17.820> you're<00:01:17.909> going<00:01:18.030> to<00:01:18.090> be<00:01:18.180> fighting<00:01:18.509> over<00:01:18.570> B

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
C and you're going to be fighting over B

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.719 
C and you're going to be fighting over B
so<00:01:19.200> as<00:01:19.409> always<00:01:20.130> you're<00:01:20.310> going<00:01:20.430> to<00:01:20.490> want<00:01:20.640> to

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
control the center of the map but to

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.469 
control the center of the map but to
take<00:01:23.220> it<00:01:23.340> a<00:01:23.400> step<00:01:23.430> further<00:01:23.820> you're<00:01:24.299> going<00:01:24.420> to

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
take it a step further you're going to

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.700 
take it a step further you're going to
want<00:01:24.630> to<00:01:24.720> try<00:01:24.930> and<00:01:25.170> push<00:01:25.740> up<00:01:26.009> into<00:01:26.700> them<00:01:26.909> and

disrupt their defense otherwise you're

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.510 
disrupt their defense otherwise you're
going<00:01:30.150> to<00:01:30.210> create<00:01:30.570> this<00:01:30.930> I<00:01:31.229> guess<00:01:31.799> choke<00:01:32.159> point

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
going to create this I guess choke point

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.719 
going to create this I guess choke point
at<00:01:32.909> they're<00:01:33.390> at<00:01:34.320> their<00:01:34.950> balcony<00:01:35.460> and<00:01:35.579> their
