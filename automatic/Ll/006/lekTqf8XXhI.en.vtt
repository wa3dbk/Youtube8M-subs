solutions we thought we did a really
good<00:02:13.600> job<00:02:13.660> of<00:02:14.050> finding<00:02:14.500> the<00:02:14.770> gap<00:02:14.980> that

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:15.520 
good job of finding the gap that

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.070 
good job of finding the gap that
Millennials<00:02:16.300> are<00:02:16.360> feeling<00:02:16.660> right<00:02:16.780> now<00:02:16.900> with

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
regards to sustainability and we believe

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:20.550 
regards to sustainability and we believe
that<00:02:19.180> our<00:02:19.390> solution<00:02:19.810> was<00:02:19.960> able<00:02:20.170> to<00:02:20.260> fill<00:02:20.440> that

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
that our solution was able to fill that

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.370 
that our solution was able to fill that
gap<00:02:20.800> and<00:02:21.010> in<00:02:21.670> the<00:02:21.760> process<00:02:21.940> put<00:02:22.660> target<00:02:23.080> front

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
gap and in the process put target front

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:24.690 
gap and in the process put target front
and<00:02:23.500> center<00:02:23.740> who<00:02:24.190> is<00:02:24.310> really<00:02:24.520> nerve-racking

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
and center who is really nerve-racking

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.330 
and center who is really nerve-racking
but<00:02:25.540> it<00:02:25.660> was<00:02:25.840> so<00:02:26.110> fun<00:02:26.440> to<00:02:26.650> be<00:02:26.830> able<00:02:26.890> to<00:02:27.130> see

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340
