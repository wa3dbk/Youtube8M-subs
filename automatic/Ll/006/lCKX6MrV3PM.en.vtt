00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.550 
so I called the second lady and you know
I<00:02:16.430> don't<00:02:16.640> know<00:02:17.000> much<00:02:17.300> about<00:02:17.380> you<00:02:18.380> know<00:02:18.530> the

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
I don't know much about you know the

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.600 
I don't know much about you know the
trainee<00:02:19.489> was<00:02:19.819> but<00:02:20.360> i'm<00:02:20.540> sure<00:02:20.569> i<00:02:21.440> don't<00:02:22.160> know

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
trainee was but i'm sure i don't know

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:24.370 
trainee was but i'm sure i don't know
i'm<00:02:22.819> sure<00:02:23.090> that<00:02:23.269> they<00:02:23.450> know<00:02:23.480> how<00:02:23.840> to<00:02:23.870> do<00:02:24.140> it

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380 
i'm sure that they know how to do it

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:27.850 
i'm sure that they know how to do it
just<00:02:24.880> like<00:02:25.880> the<00:02:26.209> certified<00:02:27.140> ones<00:02:27.410> i<00:02:27.620> just

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
just like the certified ones i just

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:29.830 
just like the certified ones i just
think<00:02:28.069> the<00:02:28.250> register<00:02:28.760> was<00:02:29.000> probably<00:02:29.510> just

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
think the register was probably just

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.080 
think the register was probably just
been<00:02:30.050> doing<00:02:30.290> it<00:02:30.410> longer<00:02:30.590> i'm<00:02:31.099> assuming<00:02:31.790> i

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
been doing it longer i'm assuming i

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.400 
been doing it longer i'm assuming i
guess<00:02:33.190> correct<00:02:34.190> me<00:02:34.280> if<00:02:34.370> I'm<00:02:34.580> wrong<00:02:34.610> but<00:02:35.410> anyway

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.410 
guess correct me if I'm wrong but anyway

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:39.820 
guess correct me if I'm wrong but anyway
I<00:02:36.440> talked<00:02:36.890> to<00:02:37.040> her<00:02:37.340> and<00:02:37.700> I<00:02:38.330> had<00:02:38.959> asked<00:02:39.440> her<00:02:39.620> as

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:39.830 
I talked to her and I had asked her as

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:42.190 
I talked to her and I had asked her as

years<00:02:46.910> so<00:02:47.390> that<00:02:47.720> was<00:02:48.230> kind<00:02:48.500> of<00:02:48.560> reassuring<00:02:49.220> to

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
years so that was kind of reassuring to

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:51.729 
years so that was kind of reassuring to
me<00:02:49.400> you<00:02:49.790> know<00:02:49.959> it<00:02:50.959> was<00:02:51.110> course<00:02:51.410> you<00:02:51.560> know<00:02:51.680> she

00:02:51.729 --> 00:02:51.739 
me you know it was course you know she

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:54.190 
me you know it was course you know she
asked<00:02:52.280> me<00:02:52.310> about<00:02:52.580> my<00:02:52.610> hair<00:02:53.269> and<00:02:53.510> how<00:02:53.720> long<00:02:53.930> it

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
asked me about my hair and how long it

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:59.559 
asked me about my hair and how long it
is<00:02:54.230> and<00:02:54.580> I<00:02:55.870> was<00:02:56.920> kind<00:02:57.920> of<00:02:58.010> hesitant<00:02:58.280> because<00:02:58.880> I

00:02:59.559 --> 00:02:59.569 
is and I was kind of hesitant because I

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:01.509 
is and I was kind of hesitant because I
don't<00:03:00.049> know<00:03:00.140> why<00:03:00.319> I<00:03:00.380> just<00:03:00.830> think<00:03:01.040> that<00:03:01.130> they'll

00:03:01.509 --> 00:03:01.519 
don't know why I just think that they'll

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:03.820 
don't know why I just think that they'll
probably<00:03:01.760> have<00:03:01.880> to<00:03:02.060> cut<00:03:02.239> it<00:03:02.269> I<00:03:02.510> don't<00:03:02.750> know<00:03:02.870> she

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:03.830 
probably have to cut it I don't know she

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:05.920 
probably have to cut it I don't know she
said<00:03:04.069> she<00:03:04.220> wouldn't<00:03:04.400> have<00:03:04.580> to<00:03:04.700> cut<00:03:04.910> it<00:03:04.940> but<00:03:05.420> I

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:05.930 
said she wouldn't have to cut it but I

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:13.289 
said she wouldn't have to cut it but I
don't<00:03:06.769> know<00:03:07.010> we'll<00:03:07.280> see<00:03:07.310> and<00:03:08.109> so<00:03:09.109> I<00:03:10.299> actually
