00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 hello all my name is one and today they 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:05.460
 I bring the tac of buying books this 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:08.220
 originally it was created by megan 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.960
 olivier in English that is mine tag but 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.420
 I decided to translate it and do it in Spanish 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.610
 because I ask I feel that in English and 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.680
 like everyone already knows where 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.510
 buy some states or those of england 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.970
 I do not know what but I live in costa rica 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.380
 then maybe it's as different for 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.029
 you know how it is that I buy 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.680
 books here note number one says that 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.930
 where he bought books and usually the 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.429
 I buy in my local bookstore that it's a 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.140
 international bookstore and that bookstore 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.700
 bigger than in costa rica this 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.770
 Question number 2 says that this order 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.630
 two books before they leave and no no 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.820
 I do it because I really do not 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.250
 It serves and if I do it I will arrive 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.920
 very late / I feel it's not worth it 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.390
 do it before the question comes out 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:49.050
 number three is to say how many books 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:52.649
 buy average a month and good in my 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:56.100
 day dreams are marx and in reality 12 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:58.500
 and if I'm lucky as 3 maybe the 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.270
 question number 4 and 5 go as 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.600
 holding hands and the question is 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.809
 what 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:06.420
 if I use my local library and if I 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.759
 I use how many books I get per month and I do not 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.110
 I do not use it because it's really edited 

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:12.780
 books that do not really have me 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:16.439
 they are interested because what I read is how cool 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:19.290
 and he gave me that what is there is how pure 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:22.440
 things about shakespeare stories and things 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.820
 so then question number 6 says 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:26.009
 what is of opinion in books of 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.259
 library I'm not more sure that I 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:30.149
 I mean this but I guess this is going 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.490
 as more towards the people that really 

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:35.970
 takes out books from the library but as 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:38.460
 I do not take out then I do not know what my 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.289
 opinion about them question number 7 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.600
 it's here that I think about the places 

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:45.929
 where they sell used or charitable books 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.909
 and that and I only bought a book 

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:52.080
 used in all my life in a place of 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:54.149
 those and was marianela because I do not remember 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:56.310
 who is the author who does not have 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:59.700
 to read in school type like in or 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:01.860
 good and if that was like everything and really 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:05.850
 I would not mind buying used books 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:07.920
 if here there would be bookstores more comfortable than 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.600
 what I read but since I do not have that 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.610
 excess then just do not 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.290
 uses question number 11 says that 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.090
 if I keep the books that I have not 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.519
 read in which I have already read in 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.350
 places like different auto phone the 

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:21.740
 I put all together because in this 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:24.260
 I do not have a bookseller 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:26.660
 as you can see then I have some 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.580
 books up there I have others like there 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:30.500
 up there is a space and I have 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:33.080
 a little bookseller here in front of me 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.940
 and can at least those who are here 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:36.380
 I have them sorted by gender 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:39.110
 then I have dystopian screws 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:40.910
 first after like all paranormal and 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:42.860
 until I have an eye I have what is 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:45.290
 contemporary or the things that 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:48.170
 I just did not find them there 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:49.820
 between my own dish and paranormal I made the 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:52.430
 question numbers not well says that if I 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:54.290
 I plan to read all the books I have and 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:56.660
 I say not really 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:59.720
 I would say yes with regard to books 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:02.000
 I bought I or I have asked so 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:04.550
 and that I bought because I have some 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.740
 books like classics that my dad has 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:09.920
 bought because it's always how it should be 

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:12.920
 read more classics and I although they bore me 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:15.200
 a little bit then this one I have several 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:18.209
 graphics as well as with montecristo and 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:21.819
 partition and 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:24.310
 but I'm really not very sure about 

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:25.780
 some time I will achieve you deserve because not 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:28.090
 they call me a lot another offense is 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:30.880
 looking for faces that I never wanted 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:32.590
 read them then this question is going to 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:34.630
 be as open wondering 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:36.610
 the days say what I do with books 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:37.930
 that I did not like after reading them or 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:41.739
 the books that I feel I'm never going to 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:44.650
 read and nothing else I keep them because I 

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:46.060
 like to have more books in my I freed 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:48.849
 of 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:50.880
 and really if there is one like that 

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:53.140
 I really did not like it and I say that 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:55.300
 then I usually put them as 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:57.610
 within a sheaf and that I have of 

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:59.140
 books like the classics or like 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:00.819
 the few books that are the little ones 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:02.650
 I do not like having them out there 

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:05.380
 because they look a little ugly with 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:07.390
 we then this nothing else what 

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:10.030
 fourth out there does not admit that it is pierre 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:11.769
 where two books and yes yes is a moon or 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:13.810
 most of the books that I had 

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:17.290
 when I was very little I said where two 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:18.820
 kisses and I think that only goes out is therefore 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:21.700
 that I have at this moment after 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:24.280
 The company could never donate them because 

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:27.120
 they are part of my book collection and 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:27.120
 that is sacred 

00:04:27.409 --> 00:04:32.280
 in this state as in a period of 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:34.080
 prohibition to buy books and not 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:36.810
 because I also do not buy many 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:38.610
 books then how will you prohibit me 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:40.670
 purchase of books and I buy myself as a 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:42.980
 book a month 

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:46.310
 in the question says that if I feel that 

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:48.260
 bought many books no no if I could 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:51.220
 if I had all this world and if I had 

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:55.070
 access to all this and I think that 

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:56.840
 would buy think of giving minus 20 miners 

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:59.360
 in the middle they ask themselves more to see a 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:02.570
 book every day of tomorrow against a day 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:05.090
 every day that would be like living in the 

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:07.010
 heaven I am here as I am so 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:09.980
 happy buying a book per day and see 

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:11.270
 how to put each one and if they would be 30 

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:14.240
 books per month 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:17.480
 these too many but still I feel that 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:19.610
 there would be more books I want to buy 

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:21.830
 sometimes like a drug in short this was the 

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:24.350
 today's tag I'm going to carve a few 

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:26.390
 beautiful beautiful people back yesterday to 

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:28.280
 Adriana of imagining klaus with books 

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:30.590
 the clouds books and raquel caves 

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:34.570
