4x4<00:00:07.109> video<00:00:07.639> last<00:00:08.639> time<00:00:08.820> I<00:00:08.910> did<00:00:09.030> a<00:00:09.059> two<00:00:09.300> cell<00:00:09.570> and

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
4x4 video last time I did a two cell and

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.900 
4x4 video last time I did a two cell and
I<00:00:09.870> have<00:00:10.019> a<00:00:10.110> 3<00:00:10.410> cell<00:00:10.650> in<00:00:10.830> there<00:00:11.719> 5,000<00:00:12.719> milliamps

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:13.910 
I have a 3 cell in there 5,000 milliamps

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:15.860 
I have a 3 cell in there 5,000 milliamps
the<00:00:14.910> only<00:00:15.059> problem<00:00:15.330> I've<00:00:15.420> had<00:00:15.450> with<00:00:15.719> the

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
the only problem I've had with the

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.320 
the only problem I've had with the
castle<00:00:16.320> 1:8<00:00:16.560> right<00:00:17.100> now<00:00:17.310> is<00:00:17.699> that<00:00:17.970> one<00:00:18.180> of<00:00:18.270> the

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
castle 1:8 right now is that one of the

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.290 
castle 1:8 right now is that one of the
mounting<00:00:18.750> screws<00:00:19.170> fell<00:00:19.439> off<00:00:20.000> but<00:00:21.000> I<00:00:21.180> don't

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
mounting screws fell off but I don't

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:22.820 
mounting screws fell off but I don't
have<00:00:21.359> the<00:00:21.510> LCG<00:00:21.930> so<00:00:22.109> I<00:00:22.140> can't<00:00:22.380> use<00:00:22.619> those

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
have the LCG so I can't use those

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.759 
have the LCG so I can't use those
anyways<00:00:23.869> so<00:00:24.869> I<00:00:25.109> don't<00:00:25.289> really<00:00:25.350> need<00:00:25.560> those

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
anyways so I don't really need those

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.700 
anyways so I don't really need those

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710

I<00:00:32.340> remember<00:00:32.880> if<00:00:32.969> I<00:00:33.059> said<00:00:33.270> it<00:00:33.420> wasn't<00:00:33.750> in<00:00:33.840> the

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
I remember if I said it wasn't in the

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.740 
I remember if I said it wasn't in the
last<00:00:34.110> video<00:00:34.380> or<00:00:34.590> not<00:00:34.739> but<00:00:35.190> it<00:00:35.940> only<00:00:36.210> turns<00:00:36.540> on

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
last video or not but it only turns on

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.860 
last video or not but it only turns on
when<00:00:37.020> there<00:00:37.170> is<00:00:37.200> actual<00:00:37.680> heat<00:00:37.950> in<00:00:38.190> the<00:00:38.370> ESC

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:38.870 
when there is actual heat in the ESC

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:43.250 
when there is actual heat in the ESC
it's<00:00:39.870> not<00:00:40.110> constant<00:00:40.680> and<00:00:41.870> I'm<00:00:42.870> gonna<00:00:43.020> have<00:00:43.170> to

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
it's not constant and I'm gonna have to

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.440 
it's not constant and I'm gonna have to
buy<00:00:43.379> a<00:00:43.410> fan<00:00:43.710> for<00:00:43.980> the<00:00:44.010> motor<00:00:44.280> because<00:00:44.820> with<00:00:45.210> my

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
buy a fan for the motor because with my

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.090 
buy a fan for the motor because with my
gearing<00:00:45.930> right<00:00:46.110> now<00:00:46.260> it's<00:00:46.440> heating<00:00:46.770> up<00:00:46.860> quite

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
gearing right now it's heating up quite

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.520 
gearing right now it's heating up quite
a<00:00:47.129> bit<00:00:47.340> I<00:00:47.550> have<00:00:48.090> a<00:00:48.180> 22<00:00:48.660> opinion<00:00:49.230> and<00:00:49.469> a<00:00:49.920> 52<00:00:50.910> spur
