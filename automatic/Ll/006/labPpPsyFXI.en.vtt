rather so anyways there's a few topics
want<00:00:18.029> to<00:00:18.119> talk<00:00:18.270> about<00:00:18.300> the<00:00:18.720> first<00:00:18.869> one<00:00:19.109> I<00:00:19.380> guess

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
want to talk about the first one I guess

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.170 
want to talk about the first one I guess
is<00:00:19.859> kind<00:00:20.039> of<00:00:20.189> the<00:00:20.279> least<00:00:20.460> important<00:00:20.970> if<00:00:21.060> you

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
is kind of the least important if you

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.870 
is kind of the least important if you
will<00:00:21.390> but<00:00:22.199> the<00:00:22.380> perks<00:00:22.710> now<00:00:23.430> when<00:00:23.730> we<00:00:23.760> talk

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
will but the perks now when we talk

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.370 
will but the perks now when we talk
about<00:00:24.060> perks<00:00:24.480> we<00:00:24.630> always<00:00:24.840> look<00:00:24.990> at<00:00:25.140> variety

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
about perks we always look at variety

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.140 
about perks we always look at variety
and<00:00:25.740> seeing<00:00:26.039> how<00:00:26.250> we<00:00:26.310> can<00:00:26.550> get<00:00:26.880> you<00:00:27.119> know

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
and seeing how we can get you know

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:28.759 
and seeing how we can get you know
better<00:00:27.449> set<00:00:27.779> ups<00:00:27.990> and<00:00:28.170> stuff<00:00:28.349> and<00:00:28.500> I<00:00:28.560> think

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
better set ups and stuff and I think

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.769 
better set ups and stuff and I think
that<00:00:28.920> in<00:00:29.010> mw2<00:00:29.550> there<00:00:30.359> are<00:00:30.480> a<00:00:30.510> few<00:00:30.689> different

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
that in mw2 there are a few different

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.900 
that in mw2 there are a few different
ways<00:00:31.050> you<00:00:31.170> can<00:00:31.320> go<00:00:31.590> about<00:00:31.619> it<00:00:32.040> so<00:00:32.250> you<00:00:32.790> could

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
ways you can go about it so you could

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.100 
ways you can go about it so you could
either<00:00:33.059> use<00:00:33.210> something<00:00:33.600> like<00:00:33.630> sleight<00:00:34.079> of

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
either use something like sleight of

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.110 
either use something like sleight of
hand<00:00:34.440> stopping<00:00:34.860> power<00:00:35.190> and<00:00:35.430> ninja<00:00:35.760> and<00:00:35.940> really

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
play that Slayer role kind of

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.530 
play that Slayer role kind of
conservative<00:00:37.980> just<00:00:38.879> sitting<00:00:39.180> back<00:00:39.329> and

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
conservative just sitting back and

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:40.850

waiting for the opponent's to come to

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.130 
waiting for the opponent's to come to
you<00:00:41.010> or<00:00:41.190> you<00:00:41.790> could<00:00:42.360> use<00:00:42.540> the<00:00:42.719> marathon

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
stuff like that or you can kind of mix

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.600 
stuff like that or you can kind of mix
the<00:00:49.140> two<00:00:49.289> and<00:00:49.440> use<00:00:49.559> marathon<00:00:50.100> and<00:00:50.370> stopping

the two and use marathon and stopping

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.520 
the two and use marathon and stopping
power<00:00:50.910> I<00:00:51.090> ninja<00:00:51.510> that<00:00:52.230> would<00:00:52.350> be<00:00:52.440> an

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
power I ninja that would be an

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.590 
power I ninja that would be an
aggressive<00:00:52.980> Slayer<00:00:53.430> maybe<00:00:53.760> a<00:00:53.850> support<00:00:54.329> player

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
aggressive Slayer maybe a support player

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.209 
aggressive Slayer maybe a support player
but<00:00:54.870> you<00:00:54.930> can<00:00:55.079> mix<00:00:55.260> it<00:00:55.440> up<00:00:55.530> a<00:00:55.680> lot<00:00:55.800> more<00:00:56.010> than

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
but you can mix it up a lot more than

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.279 
but you can mix it up a lot more than
you<00:00:56.309> can<00:00:56.579> from<00:00:57.149> at<00:00:57.360> least<00:00:57.480> what<00:00:57.750> it<00:00:57.840> looks<00:00:58.109> like

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
you can from at least what it looks like

00:00:58.289 --> 00:00:59.510 
you can from at least what it looks like
because<00:00:58.500> again<00:00:58.770> I<00:00:58.800> haven't<00:00:59.039> played<00:00:59.219> the<00:00:59.489> game

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
because again I haven't played the game

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.360 
because again I haven't played the game
but<00:01:00.270> from<00:01:00.449> what<00:01:00.570> it<00:01:00.690> looks<00:01:00.719> like<00:01:01.079> in<00:01:01.350> mw3<00:01:01.920> it

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
but from what it looks like in mw3 it

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.549 
but from what it looks like in mw3 it
looks<00:01:02.550> like<00:01:02.760> there's<00:01:03.300> going<00:01:03.480> to<00:01:03.570> be<00:01:03.629> one<00:01:04.140> set

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
looks like there's going to be one set

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.530 
looks like there's going to be one set
you<00:01:04.890> know<00:01:05.010> standard<00:01:05.549> for<00:01:05.790> perk<00:01:06.000> setup<00:01:06.360> and<00:01:06.510> I

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
you know standard for perk setup and I

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:07.969 
you know standard for perk setup and I
don't<00:01:06.750> like<00:01:06.900> that<00:01:06.960> I<00:01:07.170> think<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.560> less<00:01:07.740> variety

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
don't like that I think the less variety

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.920 
don't like that I think the less variety
is<00:01:08.400> not<00:01:08.640> something<00:01:08.880> they<00:01:09.119> call<00:01:09.330> of<00:01:09.420> duty<00:01:09.659> scene

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
is not something they call of duty scene

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.080 
is not something they call of duty scene
needs<00:01:10.740> especially<00:01:11.100> for<00:01:11.520> the<00:01:11.580> competitive

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
needs especially for the competitive

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.969 
needs especially for the competitive
side<00:01:12.240> because<00:01:12.659> I<00:01:12.869> still<00:01:13.530> think<00:01:13.710> there<00:01:13.830> will<00:01:13.920> be

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
side because I still think there will be

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.800 
side because I still think there will be
a<00:01:14.100> variety<00:01:14.280> for<00:01:14.760> casual<00:01:15.240> because<00:01:15.420> there's<00:01:15.630> you

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
a variety for casual because there's you

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.030 
a variety for casual because there's you
know<00:01:15.840> a<00:01:15.930> lot<00:01:16.110> of<00:01:16.140> stuff<00:01:16.409> doing<00:01:16.590> with<00:01:16.799> kill

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
know a lot of stuff doing with kill

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.830 
know a lot of stuff doing with kill
streaks<00:01:17.340> and<00:01:17.490> stuff<00:01:17.700> like<00:01:17.820> that<00:01:17.880> but<00:01:18.659> for

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
streaks and stuff like that but for

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.440 
streaks and stuff like that but for
competitive<00:01:19.409> you<00:01:19.590> have<00:01:19.710> slight<00:01:20.009> of<00:01:20.159> hand

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:20.450 
competitive you have slight of hand

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:22.730 
competitive you have slight of hand
quick-draw<00:01:21.450> and<00:01:21.689> dead<00:01:21.840> silence<00:01:22.320> and<00:01:22.470> the<00:01:22.530> only

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
quick-draw and dead silence and the only

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.280 
quick-draw and dead silence and the only
variation<00:01:23.189> that<00:01:23.520> I<00:01:23.640> see<00:01:23.909> is<00:01:24.290> possibly

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
variation that I see is possibly

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.140 
variation that I see is possibly
marathon<00:01:25.890> instead<00:01:26.369> of<00:01:26.460> sleight<00:01:26.670> of<00:01:26.700> hand<00:01:27.030> and

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
marathon instead of sleight of hand and

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.550 
marathon instead of sleight of hand and
I<00:01:27.270> don't<00:01:27.600> see<00:01:27.810> that<00:01:27.930> that<00:01:27.990> will<00:01:28.259> come<00:01:28.409> into

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
I don't see that that will come into

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.679 
I don't see that that will come into
play<00:01:28.770> too<00:01:28.860> often<00:01:29.400> unless<00:01:29.610> the<00:01:29.820> maps<00:01:30.000> are<00:01:30.150> huge

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
play too often unless the maps are huge

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.109 
play too often unless the maps are huge
but<00:01:31.560> quick<00:01:31.799> draw<00:01:32.070> every<00:01:32.490> other<00:01:32.579> perkin<00:01:33.000> its

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
but quick draw every other perkin its

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:34.550 
but quick draw every other perkin its
category<00:01:33.420> has<00:01:33.720> to<00:01:33.840> do<00:01:33.930> with<00:01:34.020> the<00:01:34.110> killstreak

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
category has to do with the killstreak

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.560 
category has to do with the killstreak
and<00:01:34.770> dead<00:01:35.310> silence<00:01:35.759> the<00:01:35.909> only<00:01:36.119> other<00:01:36.240> perks

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
and dead silence the only other perks

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.060 
and dead silence the only other perks
that's<00:01:36.750> kind<00:01:36.990> of<00:01:37.049> close<00:01:37.170> to<00:01:37.259> steady<00:01:37.650> game<00:01:37.860> but

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
that's kind of close to steady game but

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.440 
that's kind of close to steady game but
you<00:01:38.130> can't<00:01:38.430> give<00:01:38.549> up<00:01:38.670> that<00:01:38.850> sound<00:01:39.150> advantage

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
you can't give up that sound advantage

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.469 
you can't give up that sound advantage
so<00:01:40.350> I<00:01:40.380> think<00:01:40.530> the<00:01:40.770> lack<00:01:41.640> of<00:01:41.670> variety<00:01:42.030> here<00:01:42.390> in

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
so I think the lack of variety here in

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.060 
so I think the lack of variety here in
the<00:01:42.570> perk<00:01:42.780> setups<00:01:43.229> is<00:01:43.439> not<00:01:43.710> going<00:01:43.860> to<00:01:43.920> be<00:01:44.040> a

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
the perk setups is not going to be a

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.929 
the perk setups is not going to be a
good<00:01:44.250> thing<00:01:44.430> for<00:01:44.990> for<00:01:45.990> modern<00:01:46.380> warfare<00:01:46.530> 3<00:01:46.939> but

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
good thing for for modern warfare 3 but

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.240 
good thing for for modern warfare 3 but
transitioning<00:01:48.479> to<00:01:48.780> another<00:01:49.229> topic<00:01:49.619> that<00:01:49.860> guns

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
transitioning to another topic that guns

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.539 
transitioning to another topic that guns
I<00:01:50.549> think<00:01:51.119> that<00:01:51.299> that<00:01:51.329> will<00:01:51.869> kind<00:01:52.140> of<00:01:52.369> make<00:01:53.369> the

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
I think that that will kind of make the

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.910 
I think that that will kind of make the
game<00:01:53.729> a<00:01:53.759> bit<00:01:54.119> more<00:01:54.360> diverse<00:01:54.689> in<00:01:54.990> in<00:01:55.710> that

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
game a bit more diverse in in that

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.580 
game a bit more diverse in in that
aspect<00:01:56.310> where<00:01:56.700> you<00:01:57.390> have<00:01:57.659> over<00:01:57.960> 10<00:01:58.229> assault

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
aspect where you have over 10 assault

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.070 
aspect where you have over 10 assault
rifles<00:01:58.979> you<00:01:59.100> have<00:01:59.219> numerous<00:01:59.670> as

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:00.080 
rifles you have numerous as

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.230 
rifles you have numerous as
geez<00:02:00.350> and<00:02:00.770> a<00:02:00.830> whole<00:02:01.100> bunch<00:02:01.130> of<00:02:01.400> new<00:02:01.580> guns<00:02:01.940> that

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:02.240 
geez and a whole bunch of new guns that

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.510 
geez and a whole bunch of new guns that
might<00:02:02.870> be<00:02:03.050> really<00:02:03.260> good<00:02:03.620> and<00:02:03.800> I<00:02:04.040> think<00:02:04.280> that

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:04.520 
might be really good and I think that

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.000 
might be really good and I think that
the<00:02:05.090> more<00:02:05.330> guns<00:02:05.600> you<00:02:05.750> have<00:02:05.780> the<00:02:06.440> more<00:02:06.590> likely

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:07.010 
the more guns you have the more likely

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:09.280 
the more guns you have the more likely
you<00:02:07.130> are<00:02:07.160> to<00:02:07.340> have<00:02:07.730> more<00:02:08.300> than<00:02:08.479> one<00:02:08.750> dominant

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:09.290 
you are to have more than one dominant

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:10.420 
you are to have more than one dominant
weapon<00:02:09.410> and<00:02:09.680> I<00:02:09.770> think<00:02:09.979> that's<00:02:10.130> something<00:02:10.280> that

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:10.430 
weapon and I think that's something that

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:12.490 
weapon and I think that's something that
a<00:02:10.550> call<00:02:10.790> of<00:02:10.880> duty<00:02:11.090> series<00:02:11.330> a<00:02:11.480> new<00:02:11.780> call<00:02:12.200> of<00:02:12.230> duty

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
a call of duty series a new call of duty

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.560 
a call of duty series a new call of duty
game<00:02:12.680> really<00:02:12.980> needs<00:02:13.070> is<00:02:13.400> to<00:02:13.520> have<00:02:13.700> a<00:02:13.730> good

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:14.570 
game really needs is to have a good

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:16.720 
game really needs is to have a good
variety<00:02:14.780> a<00:02:15.110> good<00:02:15.350> list<00:02:15.620> of<00:02:15.830> solid<00:02:16.340> weapons

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
variety a good list of solid weapons

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:18.280 
variety a good list of solid weapons
that<00:02:16.820> you<00:02:16.940> can<00:02:17.090> use<00:02:17.300> without<00:02:17.510> really<00:02:17.810> having<00:02:18.020> a

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
that you can use without really having a

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.530 
that you can use without really having a
disadvantage<00:02:18.950> and<00:02:19.130> endow<00:02:19.880> you<00:02:20.030> to<00:02:20.240> you<00:02:20.390> could

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
disadvantage and endow you to you could

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.890 
disadvantage and endow you to you could
use<00:02:20.690> the<00:02:20.900> tarsk<00:02:21.500> are<00:02:21.710> a<00:02:22.010> CR<00:02:22.820> UMP<00:02:23.450> famas

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
use the tarsk are a CR UMP famas

use the tarsk are a CR UMP famas
anything<00:02:24.500> really<00:02:24.680> in<00:02:25.400> this<00:02:25.550> game<00:02:25.790> is<00:02:25.940> the

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
anything really in this game is the

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:29.290 
anything really in this game is the
famas<00:02:26.420> maybe<00:02:27.020> the<00:02:27.230> 74<00:02:27.890> but<00:02:28.670> not<00:02:28.790> even<00:02:28.850> really

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:29.300 
famas maybe the 74 but not even really

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:31.870 
famas maybe the 74 but not even really
that<00:02:29.420> much<00:02:29.780> for<00:02:29.990> the<00:02:30.050> 74<00:02:30.680> so<00:02:31.130> I<00:02:31.160> think<00:02:31.280> the<00:02:31.640> new

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:31.880 
that much for the 74 so I think the new

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.360 
that much for the 74 so I think the new
the<00:02:32.300> new<00:02:32.570> edition<00:02:33.050> of<00:02:33.140> guns<00:02:33.380> more<00:02:33.830> guns<00:02:33.860> will

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
the new edition of guns more guns will

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.630 
the new edition of guns more guns will
make<00:02:34.550> it<00:02:34.760> so<00:02:35.000> that<00:02:35.800> mw3<00:02:36.800> will<00:02:37.100> be<00:02:37.220> a<00:02:37.250> little<00:02:37.490> bit

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640 
make it so that mw3 will be a little bit

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.010 
make it so that mw3 will be a little bit
more<00:02:37.820> diverse<00:02:38.120> when<00:02:38.300> it<00:02:38.390> comes<00:02:38.510> to<00:02:38.660> guns<00:02:38.870> a

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:39.020 
more diverse when it comes to guns a

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:40.270 
more diverse when it comes to guns a
little<00:02:39.230> bit<00:02:39.320> less<00:02:39.470> diverse<00:02:39.740> when<00:02:39.920> it<00:02:40.010> comes<00:02:40.190> to

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
little bit less diverse when it comes to

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.280 
little bit less diverse when it comes to
the<00:02:40.370> perks<00:02:40.610> now<00:02:41.390> something<00:02:41.630> else<00:02:41.870> that's<00:02:42.110> kind

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.290 
the perks now something else that's kind

the perks now something else that's kind
of<00:02:42.320> interesting<00:02:42.560> guys<00:02:42.950> is<00:02:43.250> the<00:02:43.610> killstreaks
