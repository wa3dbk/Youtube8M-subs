not a lot of sand you know I couldn't
find<00:03:42.060> no<00:03:42.239> desert<00:03:42.569> area<00:03:43.380> so<00:03:43.769> that's<00:03:44.190> one<00:03:44.519> thing

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
find no desert area so that's one thing

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:47.690 
find no desert area so that's one thing
that<00:03:44.910> threw<00:03:45.150> me<00:03:45.239> off<00:03:45.919> now<00:03:46.919> this<00:03:47.099> over<00:03:47.459> here

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:47.700 
that threw me off now this over here

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:49.940 
that threw me off now this over here
this<00:03:47.880> is<00:03:47.940> a<00:03:48.090> another<00:03:48.750> point<00:03:49.139> of<00:03:49.230> interest<00:03:49.380> so

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:49.950 
this is a another point of interest so

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:52.339 
this is a another point of interest so
for<00:03:50.190> you<00:03:50.280> guys<00:03:50.519> this<00:03:50.819> is<00:03:51.060> the<00:03:51.750> coordinates

00:03:52.339 --> 00:03:52.349 
for you guys this is the coordinates

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:54.949 
for you guys this is the coordinates
right<00:03:52.650> here<00:03:52.919> on<00:03:53.069> the<00:03:53.190> map<00:03:53.430> and<00:03:53.790> to<00:03:54.780> my

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:54.959 
right here on the map and to my

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:56.960 
right here on the map and to my
understanding<00:03:55.709> this<00:03:56.160> is<00:03:56.220> actually<00:03:56.669> a<00:03:56.700> really

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 
understanding this is actually a really

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:59.240 
understanding this is actually a really
nice<00:03:57.269> cave<00:03:57.630> system<00:03:58.230> the<00:03:58.410> reason<00:03:58.680> why<00:03:58.829> I<00:03:58.859> put

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 
nice cave system the reason why I put

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:01.220 
nice cave system the reason why I put
this<00:03:59.459> is<00:03:59.700> here's<00:04:00.299> the<00:04:00.359> coordinates<00:04:01.019> but

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.230 
this is here's the coordinates but

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:04.190 
this is here's the coordinates but
you'll<00:04:01.410> see<00:04:01.590> it<00:04:01.680> in<00:04:01.799> a<00:04:01.889> second<00:04:02.340> guys<00:04:02.519> just<00:04:03.200> look

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200 
you'll see it in a second guys just look

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.909 
you'll see it in a second guys just look
at<00:04:04.349> this<00:04:04.470> look<00:04:04.769> how<00:04:04.889> deep<00:04:05.220> it<00:04:05.430> goes<00:04:05.669> like<00:04:06.000> damn

00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:06.919 
at this look how deep it goes like damn

00:04:06.919 --> 00:04:09.680 
at this look how deep it goes like damn
that<00:04:07.919> looks<00:04:08.040> good<00:04:08.340> I'm<00:04:09.090> not<00:04:09.150> gonna<00:04:09.389> fully
