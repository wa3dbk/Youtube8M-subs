spin

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:35.590 
spin

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:38.520 
spin
when<00:01:36.159> they<00:01:36.310> hit<00:01:36.490> the<00:01:36.790> flywheel<00:01:37.329> and<00:01:37.659> it<00:01:38.170> chews

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:41.110 
up the flywheel teeth this one's called

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:44.520 
up the flywheel teeth this one's called
a<00:01:41.290> pre-engaged<00:01:42.189> starter<00:01:43.149> so<00:01:43.750> it's<00:01:44.049> already

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:44.530 
a pre-engaged starter so it's already

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:46.560 
a pre-engaged starter so it's already
engaged<00:01:45.159> in<00:01:45.430> the<00:01:45.579> flywheel<00:01:46.060> before<00:01:46.509> it

back side and let's hook him up here get
a<00:02:02.530> nice<00:02:02.860> nice<00:02:03.310> connection<00:02:04.119> here<00:02:04.390> and<00:02:06.090> this<00:02:07.090> is

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.270 
a nice nice connection here and this is

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:09.419 
a nice nice connection here and this is
our<00:02:07.420> operational<00:02:08.200> lead<00:02:08.440> and<00:02:08.739> when<00:02:09.100> I<00:02:09.130> kick

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:09.429 
our operational lead and when I kick

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:12.660 
our operational lead and when I kick
this<00:02:09.580> thing<00:02:09.819> on<00:02:09.970> if<00:02:10.569> I<00:02:10.810> touch<00:02:11.530> him<00:02:11.739> here<00:02:12.069> he

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
this thing on if I touch him here he

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.370 
this thing on if I touch him here he
should<00:02:12.730> work

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:22.370 

so<00:02:16.980> let's<00:02:17.490> try<00:02:17.760> them<00:02:19.640> whoo<00:02:21.140> moving<00:02:22.140> real

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
so let's try them whoo moving real

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:29.790 
so let's try them whoo moving real
slowly<00:02:22.920> is<00:02:23.760> moving<00:02:24.360> really<00:02:24.900> really<00:02:25.500> slowly

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:29.800 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:33.210 

he<00:02:30.800> gets<00:02:31.100> there<00:02:31.460> but<00:02:31.670> he's<00:02:31.790> moving<00:02:32.180> slowly

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
he gets there but he's moving slowly

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:38.800 
he gets there but he's moving slowly
there<00:02:34.220> we<00:02:34.340> go

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:43.620 

kind<00:02:39.380> of<00:02:39.410> crappy<00:02:41.020> boy<00:02:42.020> fake<00:02:42.590> Mick<00:02:43.100> makes<00:02:43.280> me

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:43.630 
kind of crappy boy fake Mick makes me

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:47.200 
kind of crappy boy fake Mick makes me
wonder<00:02:44.630> if<00:02:44.780> like<00:02:44.990> my<00:02:45.860> connections<00:02:46.730> here<00:02:46.940> are

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:47.210 
wonder if like my connections here are

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:50.720 
wonder if like my connections here are
good<00:02:47.930> or<00:02:48.050> bad

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.030 

that<00:02:51.330> was<00:02:51.540> falling<00:02:51.900> down<00:02:52.050> on<00:02:52.470> the<00:02:52.620> on<00:02:52.890> the

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
that was falling down on the on the

00:02:53.040 --> 00:03:00.970 
that was falling down on the on the
starter<00:02:53.370> lead<00:02:53.610> here<00:02:56.120> that<00:02:57.120> is<00:02:57.390> hot

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:03.520 

once

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:03.530 
once

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:07.240 
once
slow

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:10.830 

nice<00:03:07.790> and<00:03:08.000> fast

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.559 

fast<00:03:11.500> you<00:03:11.830> can<00:03:12.010> hear<00:03:12.310> you<00:03:12.489> can<00:03:12.670> hear<00:03:12.910> it<00:03:13.030> it's

00:03:13.559 --> 00:03:13.569 
fast you can hear you can hear it it's

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:17.290 
fast you can hear you can hear it it's
not<00:03:13.720> not<00:03:14.230> making<00:03:14.620> a<00:03:14.709> good<00:03:14.739> noise

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:17.300 

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:19.630 

you<00:03:17.720> can<00:03:17.900> see<00:03:18.110> that<00:03:18.290> Bendix<00:03:18.830> snap<00:03:19.160> out<00:03:19.430> and

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:19.640 
you can see that Bendix snap out and

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:22.750 
you can see that Bendix snap out and
then<00:03:19.790> start<00:03:20.150> to<00:03:20.300> turn

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:22.760 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:27.190 

that<00:03:23.629> time<00:03:23.840> was<00:03:23.989> slow<00:03:25.840> slow<00:03:26.840> there's

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:27.200 
that time was slow slow there's

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.470 
that time was slow slow there's
something<00:03:27.560> wrong<00:03:27.709> with<00:03:27.950> the<00:03:28.129> starter<00:03:28.579> what's

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480 
something wrong with the starter what's

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:32.530 
something wrong with the starter what's
wrong<00:03:29.780> it<00:03:30.709> might<00:03:30.950> be<00:03:31.010> the<00:03:31.250> solenoid<00:03:31.790> it<00:03:32.209> might

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:32.540 
wrong it might be the solenoid it might

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:34.899 
wrong it might be the solenoid it might
be<00:03:32.689> the<00:03:32.840> starter<00:03:33.260> motor<00:03:33.290> if<00:03:34.280> we<00:03:34.489> want<00:03:34.700> to<00:03:34.790> go

00:03:34.899 --> 00:03:34.909 
be the starter motor if we want to go

00:03:34.909 --> 00:03:38.140 
be the starter motor if we want to go
right<00:03:35.120> to<00:03:35.180> the<00:03:35.599> starter<00:03:36.049> motor<00:03:36.310> which<00:03:37.310> is<00:03:37.340> the

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:38.150 
right to the starter motor which is the

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:40.420 
right to the starter motor which is the
connection<00:03:38.900> that<00:03:39.049> runs<00:03:39.290> down<00:03:39.560> down<00:03:40.010> to<00:03:40.310> the

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:40.430 
connection that runs down down to the

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:43.690 
connection that runs down down to the
starter<00:03:40.730> motor<00:03:40.760> here<00:03:41.269> we<00:03:41.900> can<00:03:42.110> get<00:03:42.379> him<00:03:42.700> hooked

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:43.700 
starter motor here we can get him hooked

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:46.720 
starter motor here we can get him hooked
up<00:03:44.140> we<00:03:45.140> can<00:03:45.319> try<00:03:45.530> just<00:03:45.829> a<00:03:46.010> just<00:03:46.340> the<00:03:46.489> motor

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:46.730 
up we can try just a just the motor

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:54.110 
up we can try just a just the motor
itself<00:03:50.140> sounds<00:03:51.140> good

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:57.369 

so<00:03:54.660> it's<00:03:54.870> good

00:03:57.369 --> 00:03:57.379 

00:03:57.379 --> 00:04:00.590 

so<00:03:57.890> it's<00:03:58.099> good

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:00.600 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:04.640 

sounds<00:04:00.900> good<00:04:02.930> sounds<00:04:03.930> good

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
sounds good sounds good

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:07.130 
sounds good sounds good
normally<00:04:05.340> I<00:04:05.370> would<00:04:05.670> do<00:04:05.820> this<00:04:06.000> test<00:04:06.270> 20<00:04:06.720> times

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:07.140 
normally I would do this test 20 times

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:11.780 
normally I would do this test 20 times
if<00:04:07.890> it<00:04:08.100> if<00:04:08.520> it<00:04:08.790> passes<00:04:09.650> 20<00:04:10.650> times<00:04:10.950> it's<00:04:11.520> going

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790 
if it if it passes 20 times it's going

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:13.610 
if it if it passes 20 times it's going
to<00:04:11.880> work<00:04:12.090> in<00:04:12.270> the<00:04:12.360> car<00:04:12.600> but<00:04:13.200> if<00:04:13.320> you<00:04:13.440> have<00:04:13.590> a

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
to work in the car but if you have a

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:17.050 
to work in the car but if you have a
dead<00:04:13.950> spot<00:04:14.340> on<00:04:14.640> the<00:04:14.790> on<00:04:15.060> the<00:04:15.270> commutator<00:04:15.840> then

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:17.060 
dead spot on the on the commutator then

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:20.240 
dead spot on the on the commutator then
every<00:04:18.060> now<00:04:18.209> and<00:04:18.480> then<00:04:18.630> the<00:04:19.260> dead<00:04:19.470> spots<00:04:19.860> line

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.250 
every now and then the dead spots line

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:22.460 
every now and then the dead spots line
up<00:04:20.489> with<00:04:20.640> the<00:04:20.700> brushes<00:04:21.150> and<00:04:21.360> nothing<00:04:22.350> will

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:22.470 
up with the brushes and nothing will

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:22.880 
up with the brushes and nothing will
happen

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:22.890 
happen

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:25.990 
happen
you<00:04:23.490> turn<00:04:23.820> the<00:04:23.940> key<00:04:24.150> nothing<00:04:25.050> happens<00:04:25.500> so

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:26.000 
you turn the key nothing happens so

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.180 
you turn the key nothing happens so
something's<00:04:27.000> going<00:04:27.270> on<00:04:27.390> with<00:04:27.450> this<00:04:27.780> my<00:04:28.560> gut<00:04:28.920> is

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:29.190 
something's going on with this my gut is

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:30.710 
something's going on with this my gut is
that<00:04:29.220> we<00:04:29.580> got<00:04:29.760> more<00:04:29.940> problems<00:04:30.480> with<00:04:30.600> the

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:30.720 
that we got more problems with the

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.960 
that we got more problems with the
solenoid<00:04:31.200> than<00:04:31.860> we<00:04:32.100> do<00:04:32.280> with<00:04:32.430> the<00:04:32.550> starter

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:32.970 
solenoid than we do with the starter

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:34.880 
solenoid than we do with the starter
motor<00:04:33.000> I'm<00:04:33.960> not<00:04:34.200> going<00:04:34.320> to<00:04:34.380> take<00:04:34.560> the<00:04:34.740> whole

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:34.890 
motor I'm not going to take the whole

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:36.470 
motor I'm not going to take the whole
thing<00:04:34.950> apart<00:04:35.160> here<00:04:35.700> today<00:04:36.030> I'm<00:04:36.120> just<00:04:36.300> going<00:04:36.450> to

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:36.480 
thing apart here today I'm just going to

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:39.170 
thing apart here today I'm just going to
talk<00:04:36.750> about<00:04:36.930> it<00:04:37.230> very<00:04:37.740> very<00:04:37.950> quickly<00:04:38.220> and<00:04:39.150> that

talk about it very very quickly and that

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:42.740 
talk about it very very quickly and that
is<00:04:39.540> that<00:04:39.870> you<00:04:40.320> take<00:04:40.530> the<00:04:40.740> solenoid<00:04:41.220> off<00:04:41.750> take

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:42.750 
is that you take the solenoid off take

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:45.440 
is that you take the solenoid off take
the<00:04:42.900> starter<00:04:43.290> motor<00:04:43.320> apart<00:04:44.130> you<00:04:44.940> clean

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:45.450 
the starter motor apart you clean

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:48.260 
the starter motor apart you clean
everything<00:04:46.310> make<00:04:47.310> it<00:04:47.460> nice<00:04:47.760> and<00:04:47.790> nice<00:04:48.210> and

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:48.270 
everything make it nice and nice and

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:52.070 
everything make it nice and nice and
nice<00:04:48.660> and<00:04:48.900> clean<00:04:48.960> it<00:04:49.830> all<00:04:50.010> comes<00:04:50.340> apart<00:04:51.080> maybe

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:52.080 
nice and clean it all comes apart maybe

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.260 
nice and clean it all comes apart maybe
change<00:04:52.770> the<00:04:53.010> brushes<00:04:53.490> but<00:04:53.670> changing<00:04:54.180> the

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:54.270 
change the brushes but changing the

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:57.290 
change the brushes but changing the
brushes<00:04:54.720> is<00:04:54.900> a<00:04:54.930> real<00:04:55.290> task<00:04:55.730> real<00:04:56.730> tasks<00:04:57.150> going

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:57.300 
brushes is a real task real tasks going

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:01.570 
brushes is a real task real tasks going
to<00:04:57.390> be<00:04:57.450> so<00:04:57.810> careful<00:04:58.320> with<00:04:58.380> the<00:04:58.740> solder<00:04:59.160> and<00:04:59.580> and

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:01.580 
to be so careful with the solder and and

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:04.220 
to be so careful with the solder and and
buzzing<00:05:02.580> back<00:05:02.790> here<00:05:03.030> you<00:05:03.660> got<00:05:03.810> to<00:05:03.900> be<00:05:03.990> so

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:04.230 
buzzing back here you got to be so

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:06.560 
buzzing back here you got to be so
careful<00:05:04.680> with<00:05:04.740> the<00:05:05.190> solder<00:05:05.490> and<00:05:05.820> getting<00:05:06.480> the

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:06.570 
careful with the solder and getting the

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:08.390 
careful with the solder and getting the
brushes<00:05:06.990> in<00:05:07.020> the<00:05:07.140> right<00:05:07.320> spot<00:05:07.680> and<00:05:08.130> you<00:05:08.220> get<00:05:08.370> a

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:08.400 
brushes in the right spot and you get a
