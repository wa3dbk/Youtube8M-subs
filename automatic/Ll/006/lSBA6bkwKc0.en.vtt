glamour is just like a professional the

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:02.490 
glamour is just like a professional the
idea<00:02:01.600> I<00:02:01.660> guess<00:02:01.720> what<00:02:01.960> the<00:02:02.050> one<00:02:02.170> of<00:02:02.259> the<00:02:02.320> clothes

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:02.500 
idea I guess what the one of the clothes

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.680 
idea I guess what the one of the clothes
is<00:02:02.649> not<00:02:02.800> to<00:02:03.039> overtake<00:02:03.940> the<00:02:04.119> jewelry<00:02:04.420> bit<00:02:04.570> more

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:04.690 
is not to overtake the jewelry bit more

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:05.940 
is not to overtake the jewelry bit more
to<00:02:04.750> complement<00:02:05.200> them<00:02:05.410> so<00:02:05.649> we<00:02:05.830> would<00:02:05.920> just

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:05.950 
to complement them so we would just

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:08.029 
to complement them so we would just
looked<00:02:06.220> a<00:02:06.280> lot<00:02:06.369> more<00:02:06.429> like<00:02:06.550> textures<00:02:07.149> colors
