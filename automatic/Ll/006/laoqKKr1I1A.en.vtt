that right there I'll show you how to do
I'm<00:01:10.360> just<00:01:10.390> got<00:01:10.750> a<00:01:11.250> just<00:01:12.250> an<00:01:12.400> old<00:01:12.550> VCR<00:01:12.730> here<00:01:14.160> this

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
I'm just got a just an old VCR here this

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.760 
I'm just got a just an old VCR here this
connected<00:01:17.640> just<00:01:18.640> an<00:01:18.760> old<00:01:18.910> mono<00:01:19.900> VCR<00:01:20.560> but<00:01:20.710> I

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:20.770 
connected just an old mono VCR but I

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:22.860 
connected just an old mono VCR but I
just<00:01:20.920> I<00:01:21.100> use<00:01:21.340> one<00:01:21.520> of<00:01:21.550> these<00:01:21.700> wire<00:01:22.330> connectors

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:22.870 
just I use one of these wire connectors

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:24.870 
just I use one of these wire connectors
so<00:01:23.020> we'd<00:01:23.170> have<00:01:23.200> audio<00:01:23.980> on<00:01:24.040> both<00:01:24.460> sides<00:01:24.730> of

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:24.880 
so we'd have audio on both sides of

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:26.520 
so we'd have audio on both sides of
these<00:01:25.000> old<00:01:25.180> tapes<00:01:25.360> or<00:01:25.630> mono<00:01:25.840> anyway<00:01:26.320> certainly

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:26.530 
these old tapes or mono anyway certainly

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:29.250 
these old tapes or mono anyway certainly
don't<00:01:26.890> matter<00:01:27.300> if<00:01:28.300> I<00:01:28.390> had<00:01:28.540> something<00:01:28.750> stereo

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:29.260 
don't matter if I had something stereo

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.440 
don't matter if I had something stereo
I've<00:01:29.440> used<00:01:29.740> my<00:01:30.430> good<00:01:30.610> one<00:01:30.760> over<00:01:30.970> here<00:01:31.180> but<00:01:31.330> I

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:31.450 
I've used my good one over here but I

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:39.300 
I've used my good one over here but I
didn't<00:01:31.690> drag<00:01:31.930> it<00:01:32.110> out<00:01:36.150> when<00:01:37.150> you<00:01:37.240> turn<00:01:37.480> the<00:01:38.310> VCR

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:39.310 
didn't drag it out when you turn the VCR

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:44.130 
didn't drag it out when you turn the VCR
on<00:01:42.180> pops<00:01:43.180> up<00:01:43.390> in<00:01:43.510> that<00:01:43.600> little<00:01:43.780> window<00:01:43.960> right

sometimes<00:01:51.310> you<00:01:51.460> have<00:01:51.550> to<00:01:51.670> close<00:01:51.880> it<00:01:51.940> open<00:01:52.270> it

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:52.540 
sometimes you have to close it open it

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:53.970 
sometimes you have to close it open it
back<00:01:52.660> up<00:01:52.720> again<00:01:52.960> I've<00:01:53.260> only<00:01:53.410> had<00:01:53.560> that<00:01:53.710> happen

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:57.820 
then open it again and it should connect

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:59.940
