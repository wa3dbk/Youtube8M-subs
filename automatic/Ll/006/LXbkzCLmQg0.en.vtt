00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 hello friends i just got one 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.130
 really brilliant future technology in the 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.990
 internet found i just had to 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.059
 quickly the video camera often around with you 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.460
 talk and say that all the way 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:14.040
 road race as its name implies 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.549
 is therefore about roads from solar panels 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.170
 to build 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.240
 think it over 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.380
 awesome most of them keep you street 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.449
 just walk around on the ground and do 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.400
 simply nothing for now but for 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:26.010
 They would build the solar panels 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.199
 Collect energy for us all the time 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.060
 The idea comes from American 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.980
 inventor couple whose scott and tony 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.630
 russo puts the whole thing on one 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.800
 description of the box and the idea is 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.530
 already relatively far have already 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.910
 built prototypes and maybe yours 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.980
 first worry but if I am with mine 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.140
 car would so loud one is reporting 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.910
 do not worry they have the whole thing with them 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.670
 a really stable glass coated 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.180
 second thought of the slide at 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.649
 slow down 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.390
 which is also not the case, the whole 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.730
 So already really far thought 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.039
 other advantages you have thought 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.989
 There would be room for cables under the road 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.910
 so could take internet or 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.100
 Leave the power lines through 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.750
 In winter we have it every problem is 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.460
 to go our roads or with snow 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.250
 covered are super driven source in 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:11.369
 traffic but this street had a one 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.600
 solar a unit element and would the 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.710
 melt snow so that 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.180
 no ice can arise 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.630
 where does the energy come from? 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.070
 of course, the same from road 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:22.320
 allows poems I am glad 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.880
 Just how often do I have such a system 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.220
 There are so many problems in ours 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.439
 He chooses the over- fished sea level 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.180
 the deserts are expanding out of the 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.400
 climate is transformed by demographic change 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.259
 and all the stuff that you really do 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.030
 ingenious idea maybe too 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.280
 at least a few of these things 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:41.280
 do not deliver so many jobs 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.990
 if the man road construction and have times 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.939
 extrapolated if you all roads 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.040
 Build america with this technology 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:49.880
 then you would be three times as much 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:53.040
 generate energy as the country needs 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.689
 awesome quite upright a few problems 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.310
 if now a coming earthquake 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:58.469
 maybe not as stable as 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.119
 you do not know traditional roads 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:02.640
 but even more benefits 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:05.540
 the streets are also pressure sensitive 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.100
 So now if a tree comes and 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:08.960
 when its wind comes on the tree 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.570
 Street like the check the street 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:13.100
 that is the tree and can now also the 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:15.680
 drivers were how is that 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:18.920
 the street has on microprocessors and 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:20.900
 leds that is the street especially and 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.040
 came to communicate with us so if 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.680
 Now the tree can fall over then 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.630
 road 500 meters before the danger point 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:29.210
 to write on the street itself hey 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:31.850
 Attention Scott was slower as it arrives 

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:33.950
 hinder just so many ingenious 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:36.290
 brilliant thing I just wanted to go 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.940
 just before the whole thing is now too 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:40.040
 relatively relevant because they make one 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:42.260
 crowd funding campaign so collect 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.970
 money to the idea to drive further 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.620
 link to this is a description spox 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:47.209
 if you have yours I believe 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:48.800
 because the rational being it came 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:50.900
 just gone out for a moment 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.730
 but let's move on quickly we were 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.630
 the buyers have stopped like 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:55.790
 said a way for me 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:57.650
 worth supporting idea link is in the 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:59.510
 description spox the last word about 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:00.560
 I still wanted everyone is in the future 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:02.360
 if we hopefully also more with 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:03.890
 Electric because of driving problem currently 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:05.540
 is that they are a relatively small one 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:08.360
 reach that means you have to go 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:09.140
 100 150 kilometers repeatedly the 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:12.410
 socket 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:14.090
 when the street hours have solar power 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:16.190
 then you can always load it 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:18.739
 want the range problem too 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:20.959
 drastically reduce so super brilliant 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:22.220
 I thought of ideas in many directions 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:24.080
 I also wish to be realistic 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:26.090
 I realize that open now everyone 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:28.010
 our five euros don't donate that 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:29.720
 Tomorrow will be there in front of the door 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:31.400
 a lot of money is invested by the state 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:32.390
 Structural projects have to be there 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:35.120
 be performed 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:36.620
 but the whole thing is really good 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.910
 investment in the future because that 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:39.530
 comes in again and again 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:41.810
 the Spaniards so much on coal and 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:43.940
 nuclear power if our roads for us 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:46.070
 Collecting energy is just like that 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:47.780
 Now my thoughts on how I said 

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:49.340
 got to know about the hour where 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:51.410
 has simply make spontaneous video about 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:53.209
 what are your thoughts how do you think 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:54.350
 Do you see the possibilities how to find 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:56.299
 you do it positively negative 

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:58.130
 where did you drive or what could 

00:03:56.299 --> 00:03:58.830
 go wrong with something just yours 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:01.170
 thoughts 

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:03.780
 in the comments below this video 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:04.920
 Generally I have been spontaneously in 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:07.140
 the thieves a future technology 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:08.370
 the next syringe made faster 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:10.380
 Maybe you remember reading 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:12.600
 that can be relatively good at like 

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:13.800
 you such small short videos that 

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:16.340
 what you might find more often in the future 

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:18.480
 should or should he prefer 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:20.280
 videos that thought a bit more 

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:21.330
 are and with script and so on and so on 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:24.060
 not just so fast chamber 

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:26.010
 put down and told so that's it for 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:27.150
 this video if you sprits this 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:29.490
 history wants to see then presses 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:32.640
 the first one up here a second one 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:34.350
 Her cool apps are cool iOS apps and im 

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:35.150
 third cool apps for android 

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:39.570
 smartphone 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:41.070
 ok then until the next video i want 

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:42.810
 more quickly spontaneously advertising drum 

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:45.000
 Listen for one of my best friends 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:46.980
 namely the last weeks old tooth 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.650
 made his first book out of 24 

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:51.570
 if mega proud i have the book on 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:53.700
 Correction really really read us 

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:55.590
 has become good in English means 

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:57.510
 Father is the story of one 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:05:00.780
 young couple and the squat has the 

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:02.250
 earth is to live out really to type a 

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:05.070
 point so is the book is written down 

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:06.630
 and he hated his job after all this 

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:08.700
 suit wearer if I want you to be him 

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:11.040
 pull your own thing through and you recognize 

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:13.770
 often in him and in her again 

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:15.390
 So if someone wants to buy, I nod 

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:16.470
 the swiss sport with the mega friend 

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:17.730
 to grasp the book wanted to talk how can 

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:19.380
 also like to skike and you can 

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:21.450
 probably even with the author 

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:22.230
 myself speak amino times one of my 

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:24.000
 best friends 

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:25.350
 cool guy I do not hope that 

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.830
 small advertising not bad 

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:27.830
 first look
