00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.790 
big night I'm demoing the difference
between<00:00:08.250> cold<00:00:09.030> paced<00:00:09.450> that<00:00:09.960> I've<00:00:10.080> noticed<00:00:10.290> as

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
between cold paced that I've noticed as

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.560 
between cold paced that I've noticed as
a<00:00:10.860> professional<00:00:11.700> and<00:00:12.980> soft<00:00:13.980> paste<00:00:14.460> so<00:00:15.059> this<00:00:15.360> is

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
a professional and soft paste so this is

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.250 
a professional and soft paste so this is
regular<00:00:16.560> soft<00:00:17.150> maybe<00:00:18.150> more<00:00:18.480> of<00:00:18.570> a<00:00:18.660> standard

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
regular soft maybe more of a standard

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.240 
regular soft maybe more of a standard
actually<00:00:19.970> paste<00:00:20.970> let<00:00:21.900> me<00:00:22.020> turn<00:00:22.199> this<00:00:22.619> way

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
actually paste let me turn this way

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.509 
actually paste let me turn this way
and<00:00:24.380> these<00:00:25.380> are<00:00:25.590> all<00:00:25.769> of<00:00:25.980> my<00:00:26.010> little

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
and these are all of my little

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.150 
and these are all of my little
prototypes<00:00:27.119> that<00:00:27.539> I<00:00:27.900> want<00:00:28.199> to<00:00:28.289> send<00:00:28.529> out<00:00:28.740> for

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
prototypes that I want to send out for

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:35.360 
prototypes that I want to send out for
people<00:00:29.910> to<00:00:30.210> try<00:00:30.420> and<00:00:32.390> look<00:00:33.590> this<00:00:34.590> paste<00:00:35.010> is

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
people to try and look this paste is

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.299 
people to try and look this paste is
exactly<00:00:36.149> the<00:00:36.840> same<00:00:37.079> color<00:00:37.410> as<00:00:37.649> traditional

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
exactly the same color as traditional

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.299 
exactly the same color as traditional
paste<00:00:38.550> but<00:00:38.850> I<00:00:38.940> want<00:00:39.180> you<00:00:39.329> to<00:00:39.480> notice<00:00:39.690> something

00:00:40.299 --> 00:00:40.309 
paste but I want you to notice something

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:47.150 
paste but I want you to notice something
this<00:00:41.309> paste<00:00:41.670> is<00:00:41.969> not<00:00:43.520> going<00:00:44.520> anywhere<00:00:46.160> you

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
this paste is not going anywhere you

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.650 
this paste is not going anywhere you
don't<00:00:47.820> want<00:00:48.180> to<00:00:48.480> manipulate<00:00:48.780> it<00:00:49.320> so<00:00:49.590> much<00:00:49.829> like

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:50.660 
don't want to manipulate it so much like

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:54.590 
don't want to manipulate it so much like
soft<00:00:51.660> paste<00:00:52.079> because<00:00:52.649> it<00:00:52.800> runs<00:00:53.399> better<00:00:53.850> cold

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
soft paste because it runs better cold

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.040 
soft paste because it runs better cold
which<00:00:55.530> I'm<00:00:55.770> actually<00:00:56.270> starting<00:00:57.270> to<00:00:57.600> prefer

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
which I'm actually starting to prefer

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:03.470 
which I'm actually starting to prefer
and<00:00:58.520> it<00:00:59.520> works<00:01:00.649> just<00:01:01.649> like<00:01:01.859> you<00:01:02.670> can<00:01:02.910> see<00:01:03.149> I've

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
and it works just like you can see I've

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.700 
and it works just like you can see I've
been<00:01:03.989> sugaring<00:01:04.409> my<00:01:04.680> legs<00:01:04.920> like<00:01:05.250> crazy<00:01:06.500> you<00:01:07.500> can

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
been sugaring my legs like crazy you can

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:16.760 
been sugaring my legs like crazy you can
see<00:01:08.869> it<00:01:09.869> goes<00:01:10.140> on<00:01:10.439> just<00:01:14.030> like<00:01:15.030> regular<00:01:16.020> soft

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
see it goes on just like regular soft

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.450 
see it goes on just like regular soft
paste<00:01:17.540> that<00:01:18.540> size<00:01:18.930> ball<00:01:19.259> can<00:01:19.650> be<00:01:19.860> hard<00:01:20.100> to<00:01:20.310> work

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
paste that size ball can be hard to work

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.550 
paste that size ball can be hard to work
with<00:01:20.700> on<00:01:20.939> a<00:01:20.970> large<00:01:21.299> surface<00:01:21.659> area<00:01:22.170> like<00:01:22.350> this

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
with on a large surface area like this

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.770 
with on a large surface area like this
and<00:01:22.920> I<00:01:23.549> feel<00:01:23.880> like<00:01:24.090> this<00:01:24.360> spreads<00:01:25.070> much

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780 
and I feel like this spreads much

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:30.649 
and I feel like this spreads much
smoother<00:01:27.780> but<00:01:28.229> it<00:01:28.350> acts<00:01:28.619> like<00:01:28.890> regular<00:01:29.659> paste

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
smoother but it acts like regular paste

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:36.140 
smoother but it acts like regular paste
okay<00:01:31.049> this<00:01:31.560> is<00:01:31.770> non<00:01:32.630> organic<00:01:33.829> cold<00:01:34.829> sugar<00:01:35.220> okay

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
okay this is non organic cold sugar okay

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.749 
okay this is non organic cold sugar okay
so<00:01:36.869> I<00:01:36.900> was<00:01:37.259> able<00:01:37.470> to<00:01:37.680> do<00:01:37.979> this<00:01:38.159> and<00:01:38.549> make<00:01:38.729> it

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
so I was able to do this and make it

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.140 
so I was able to do this and make it
look<00:01:38.909> like<00:01:39.329> the<00:01:39.570> familiar<00:01:39.840> sugar<00:01:40.909> that<00:01:41.909> we've

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
look like the familiar sugar that we've

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.210 
look like the familiar sugar that we've
all<00:01:42.390> seen<00:01:43.020> for<00:01:43.380> years<00:01:43.700> mmm<00:01:44.759> the<00:01:45.149> same<00:01:45.420> color

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:46.220 
all seen for years mmm the same color

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:48.679 
all seen for years mmm the same color
everything<00:01:47.220> it's<00:01:47.640> just<00:01:47.970> a<00:01:48.090> cold<00:01:48.329> paste

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
everything it's just a cold paste

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.920 
everything it's just a cold paste
version<00:01:49.259> so<00:01:50.130> I<00:01:50.520> don't<00:01:51.270> recommend<00:01:51.600> this

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
version so I don't recommend this

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.050 
version so I don't recommend this
because<00:01:52.170> it's<00:01:52.470> not<00:01:52.740> as<00:01:53.280> good<00:01:53.520> for<00:01:53.880> the

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
because it's not as good for the

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:59.330 
because it's not as good for the
environment<00:01:54.240> I'm<00:01:54.960> a<00:01:55.470> no<00:01:56.310> GMO<00:01:57.320> person<00:01:58.340> because

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
environment I'm a no GMO person because

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.990 
environment I'm a no GMO person because
my<00:01:59.820> body<00:02:00.060> reacts<00:02:00.479> to<00:02:00.689> it<00:02:00.930> so<00:02:01.530> that's<00:02:02.430> why<00:02:02.820> I'm

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
my body reacts to it so that's why I'm

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.209 
my body reacts to it so that's why I'm
not<00:02:03.030> producing<00:02:03.990> paste<00:02:04.439> that<00:02:04.829> will<00:02:04.979> look

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
not producing paste that will look

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:06.139 
not producing paste that will look
familiar

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
familiar

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:10.160 
familiar
either<00:02:07.429> organic<00:02:08.429> sugar<00:02:08.700> has<00:02:09.000> molasses<00:02:09.750> in<00:02:09.989> it

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
either organic sugar has molasses in it

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.949 
either organic sugar has molasses in it
they<00:02:10.860> take<00:02:11.099> a<00:02:11.160> chemical<00:02:11.520> and<00:02:12.150> they<00:02:12.629> remove

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
they take a chemical and they remove

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:13.550 
they take a chemical and they remove
this

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
this

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:19.180 
this
from<00:02:14.160> this<00:02:14.550> type<00:02:14.850> of<00:02:15.030> sugar<00:02:15.530> so<00:02:16.790> I'm<00:02:17.790> going<00:02:18.720> to

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
from this type of sugar so I'm going to

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:21.830 
from this type of sugar so I'm going to
switch<00:02:20.190> my<00:02:20.220> glove<00:02:20.730> here<00:02:21.090> you're<00:02:21.630> going<00:02:21.780> to

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
switch my glove here you're going to

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.530 
switch my glove here you're going to
hear<00:02:22.110> me<00:02:22.290> talking<00:02:22.560> so<00:02:22.800> and<00:02:23.520> we're<00:02:24.360> going<00:02:24.510> to

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
hear me talking so and we're going to

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.330 
hear me talking so and we're going to
demo<00:02:24.870> the<00:02:25.800> other<00:02:26.040> kind<00:02:26.580> of<00:02:26.910> paste<00:02:27.360> which<00:02:28.110> is

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
demo the other kind of paste which is

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:33.400 
demo the other kind of paste which is
the<00:02:29.340> typical<00:02:29.720> professional<00:02:30.920> taste<00:02:31.920> also

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:33.410 
the typical professional taste also

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:36.350 
the typical professional taste also
something<00:02:34.410> pretty<00:02:34.890> amazing<00:02:35.370> to<00:02:35.850> note<00:02:36.030> because

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
something pretty amazing to note because

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.110 
something pretty amazing to note because
my<00:02:36.959> legs<00:02:37.230> are<00:02:37.470> not<00:02:37.590> powdered<00:02:38.250> they're<00:02:38.880> not

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
my legs are not powdered they're not

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:44.030 
my legs are not powdered they're not
treated<00:02:39.630> with<00:02:41.720> they<00:02:42.720> were<00:02:42.780> cleansed<00:02:43.530> and<00:02:43.709> then

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
treated with they were cleansed and then

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:49.910 
treated with they were cleansed and then
a<00:02:47.000> will<00:02:48.000> was<00:02:48.480> actually<00:02:48.959> put<00:02:49.170> on<00:02:49.260> my<00:02:49.380> legs<00:02:49.620> and

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
a will was actually put on my legs and

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.400 
a will was actually put on my legs and
normally<00:02:50.519> I<00:02:50.790> found<00:02:51.540> that<00:02:51.870> that<00:02:52.050> kind<00:02:52.320> of

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
normally I found that that kind of

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:57.740 
normally I found that that kind of
breaks<00:02:52.709> the<00:02:53.510> sugar<00:02:54.510> so<00:02:55.200> first<00:02:56.360> notice<00:02:57.360> that<00:02:57.390> my

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
breaks the sugar so first notice that my

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:01.309 
breaks the sugar so first notice that my
sugar<00:02:58.050> is<00:02:58.290> moving<00:02:58.769> and<00:02:59.010> it<00:03:00.000> doesn't<00:03:00.450> with<00:03:01.019> cold

00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:01.319 
sugar is moving and it doesn't with cold

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:06.830 
sugar is moving and it doesn't with cold
paste<00:03:04.040> so<00:03:05.040> this<00:03:05.550> causes<00:03:05.970> a<00:03:06.239> lot<00:03:06.480> of<00:03:06.510> problems

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
paste so this causes a lot of problems

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.830 
paste so this causes a lot of problems
when<00:03:07.470> you're<00:03:07.650> learning<00:03:07.830> that<00:03:08.730> people<00:03:09.300> drop<00:03:09.569> it

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
when you're learning that people drop it

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.920 
when you're learning that people drop it
it<00:03:10.200> they<00:03:10.800> look<00:03:11.069> away<00:03:11.640> because<00:03:12.540> their<00:03:12.720> body

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
it they look away because their body

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.740 
it they look away because their body
isn't<00:03:13.170> programmed<00:03:13.800> to<00:03:14.220> twirl<00:03:14.550> the<00:03:14.760> thumb<00:03:15.000> so

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
isn't programmed to twirl the thumb so

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:19.000 
isn't programmed to twirl the thumb so
you<00:03:15.780> have<00:03:16.200> to<00:03:16.500> manipulate<00:03:16.800> this<00:03:17.780> constantly

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.010 
you have to manipulate this constantly

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:22.780 
you have to manipulate this constantly
also<00:03:20.010> I<00:03:20.400> think<00:03:20.459> that<00:03:20.910> the<00:03:21.180> fact<00:03:21.690> that<00:03:21.900> I<00:03:22.019> have

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:22.790 
also I think that the fact that I have

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:29.509 
also I think that the fact that I have
oils<00:03:23.790> on<00:03:24.000> my<00:03:24.030> legs<00:03:25.579> may<00:03:26.579> sort<00:03:27.480> of<00:03:27.600> break<00:03:28.519> the

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:29.519 
oils on my legs may sort of break the

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:32.410 
oils on my legs may sort of break the
paste<00:03:29.820> it<00:03:30.540> may<00:03:30.810> work<00:03:31.110> because<00:03:31.500> I<00:03:31.620> just<00:03:31.860> sugared

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:32.420 
paste it may work because I just sugared

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:35.270 
paste it may work because I just sugared
but<00:03:33.420> I<00:03:33.450> don't<00:03:33.840> feel<00:03:34.320> because<00:03:34.680> of<00:03:34.860> the<00:03:35.070> oil

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
but I don't feel because of the oil

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:38.150 
but I don't feel because of the oil
barrier<00:03:35.850> I'm<00:03:36.150> not<00:03:36.420> actually<00:03:36.660> feeling<00:03:37.200> the

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
barrier I'm not actually feeling the

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:41.060 
barrier I'm not actually feeling the
pace<00:03:38.400> picking<00:03:38.910> up<00:03:39.060> any<00:03:39.329> hair<00:03:39.840> so<00:03:40.680> the<00:03:40.860> oil

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:41.070 
pace picking up any hair so the oil

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:47.690 
pace picking up any hair so the oil
barrier<00:03:41.989> seems<00:03:42.989> to<00:03:45.079> prevent<00:03:46.700> traditional

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:47.700 
barrier seems to prevent traditional

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:51.259 
barrier seems to prevent traditional
paste<00:03:48.000> from<00:03:48.390> working<00:03:48.930> as<00:03:49.140> well<00:03:49.739> and<00:03:50.070> this<00:03:51.000> is

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:51.269 
paste from working as well and this is

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:53.900 
paste from working as well and this is
what<00:03:51.540> has<00:03:51.720> really<00:03:52.079> blown<00:03:52.500> me<00:03:52.769> away<00:03:52.799> and<00:03:53.310> make

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910 
what has really blown me away and make

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:57.259 
what has really blown me away and make
me<00:03:54.120> go<00:03:54.299> on<00:03:54.329> a<00:03:54.660> sugaring<00:03:55.140> spree<00:03:55.709> this<00:03:56.609> week<00:03:56.910> and

00:03:57.259 --> 00:03:57.269 
me go on a sugaring spree this week and

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:00.069 
me go on a sugaring spree this week and
sugar<00:03:58.109> my<00:03:58.290> legs<00:03:58.500> so<00:03:58.709> much<00:03:58.890> I<00:03:59.070> have<00:03:59.280> little

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:00.079 
sugar my legs so much I have little

00:04:00.079 --> 00:04:04.060 
sugar my legs so much I have little
little<00:04:01.079> friends<00:04:01.680> appearing<00:04:02.130> from<00:04:02.370> it<00:04:02.609> so

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:04.070 
little friends appearing from it so

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:07.910 
little friends appearing from it so
anyway<00:04:05.070> I<00:04:05.400> also<00:04:06.230> wanted<00:04:07.230> to<00:04:07.260> do<00:04:07.530> some<00:04:07.769> other

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:07.920 
anyway I also wanted to do some other

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:14.750 
anyway I also wanted to do some other
videos<00:04:08.400> about<00:04:11.390> how<00:04:12.390> long<00:04:12.750> this<00:04:13.650> paste<00:04:14.010> lasts

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:14.760 
videos about how long this paste lasts

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:16.430 
videos about how long this paste lasts
compared<00:04:15.299> to<00:04:15.480> traditional<00:04:15.660> sugar

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 
compared to traditional sugar

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:20.289 
compared to traditional sugar
I<00:04:16.650> find<00:04:17.459> that<00:04:17.760> traditional<00:04:18.479> sugar<00:04:18.810> now<00:04:19.220> it

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:20.299 
I find that traditional sugar now it

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:24.050 
I find that traditional sugar now it
stiffens<00:04:21.299> up<00:04:21.570> and<00:04:22.019> stops<00:04:22.680> picking<00:04:23.340> up<00:04:23.490> hair<00:04:23.789> at

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.060 
stiffens up and stops picking up hair at

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:26.300 
stiffens up and stops picking up hair at
a<00:04:24.300> certain<00:04:24.750> point<00:04:24.990> and<00:04:25.289> it's<00:04:25.560> kind<00:04:25.919> of<00:04:26.010> a<00:04:26.130> well

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:26.310 
a certain point and it's kind of a well

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:26.960 
a certain point and it's kind of a well
known<00:04:26.550> thing

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:26.970 
known thing

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:29.390 
known thing
you<00:04:27.330> need<00:04:27.480> to<00:04:27.570> alter<00:04:27.930> it<00:04:28.080> with<00:04:28.200> water<00:04:28.500> or<00:04:29.220> you

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:29.400 
you need to alter it with water or you

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:32.090 
you need to alter it with water or you
need<00:04:29.550> to<00:04:29.580> add<00:04:29.790> fresh<00:04:30.210> paste<00:04:30.600> I<00:04:30.960> tend<00:04:31.860> to<00:04:31.950> add

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:32.100 
need to add fresh paste I tend to add

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:36.440 
need to add fresh paste I tend to add
fresh<00:04:32.670> paste<00:04:33.030> so<00:04:34.220> what<00:04:35.220> I'm<00:04:35.340> saying<00:04:35.640> is<00:04:36.030> the

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:36.450 
fresh paste so what I'm saying is the

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:39.340 
fresh paste so what I'm saying is the
cold<00:04:36.720> paste<00:04:37.140> so<00:04:37.680> far<00:04:38.100> in<00:04:38.490> my<00:04:38.790> preliminary

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:39.350 
cold paste so far in my preliminary

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:43.670 
cold paste so far in my preliminary
experiments<00:04:40.350> does<00:04:41.130> not<00:04:41.430> lose<00:04:42.360> its<00:04:42.390> ability<00:04:43.020> to

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:43.680 
experiments does not lose its ability to

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.430 
experiments does not lose its ability to
pick<00:04:43.860> up<00:04:44.010> the<00:04:44.160> hair<00:04:44.400> at<00:04:44.640> any<00:04:44.910> point<00:04:45.480> it<00:04:45.840> gets<00:04:46.320> a

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:46.440 
pick up the hair at any point it gets a

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:48.890 
pick up the hair at any point it gets a
little<00:04:46.620> bit<00:04:46.860> stiffer<00:04:47.310> so<00:04:47.910> the<00:04:48.030> consistency

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:48.900 
little bit stiffer so the consistency

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:50.510 
little bit stiffer so the consistency
that<00:04:48.930> you're<00:04:49.260> working<00:04:49.440> with<00:04:49.680> changes<00:04:50.490> a

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:50.520 
that you're working with changes a

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:52.490 
that you're working with changes a
little<00:04:50.790> bit<00:04:50.970> but<00:04:51.390> we're<00:04:51.540> all<00:04:51.720> used<00:04:52.170> to<00:04:52.380> that

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:52.500 
little bit but we're all used to that

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:56.450 
little bit but we're all used to that
from<00:04:52.980> traditional<00:04:53.910> sugar<00:04:54.170> so<00:04:55.170> this<00:04:55.980> is<00:04:56.250> my

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:56.460 
from traditional sugar so this is my

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:01.670 
from traditional sugar so this is my
organic<00:04:57.290> paste<00:04:58.290> and<00:04:58.770> again<00:04:59.700> the<00:05:00.660> reason<00:05:01.170> that

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:01.680 
organic paste and again the reason that

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:06.770 
organic paste and again the reason that
it's<00:05:01.890> so<00:05:02.040> dark<00:05:02.520> is<00:05:02.760> because<00:05:03.770> the
