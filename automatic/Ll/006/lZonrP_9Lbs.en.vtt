00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:47.840 
know what happen um I think it was

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.210 
know what happen um I think it was
muscle<00:02:48.230> everybody's<00:02:48.740> like<00:02:48.830> we've<00:02:49.010> been

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
muscle everybody's like we've been

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:50.710 
muscle everybody's like we've been
working<00:02:49.400> out<00:02:49.640> really<00:02:49.820> hard<00:02:49.940> so<00:02:50.390> it's<00:02:50.540> probably

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 
working out really hard so it's probably

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.590 
working out really hard so it's probably
muscle<00:02:51.230> and<00:02:51.830> I'm<00:02:51.890> like<00:02:52.160> I<00:02:52.490> don't<00:02:53.000> understand

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:53.600 
muscle and I'm like I don't understand

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.210 
muscle and I'm like I don't understand
how<00:02:53.660> I<00:02:53.750> fluctuates<00:02:54.320> like<00:02:54.530> that<00:02:54.710> like<00:02:55.010> one

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
how I fluctuates like that like one

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:58.540 
how I fluctuates like that like one
minute<00:02:55.400> i'll<00:02:55.730> be<00:02:56.210> like<00:02:56.650> 148<00:02:57.650> pounds<00:02:57.860> and<00:02:58.460> I'm

00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:58.550

and then I'm like okay so where'd all

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:06.220 
and then I'm like okay so where'd all
that<00:03:04.640> muscle<00:03:04.970> go<00:03:05.240> or<00:03:05.480> that<00:03:05.660> fat<00:03:05.870> and<00:03:06.110> then<00:03:06.200> I

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
that muscle go or that fat and then I

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:07.570 
that muscle go or that fat and then I
gained<00:03:06.470> it<00:03:06.620> back<00:03:06.650> like<00:03:06.950> a<00:03:07.010> week<00:03:07.220> later<00:03:07.250> I'm

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:07.580 
gained it back like a week later I'm

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:09.820 
gained it back like a week later I'm
like<00:03:07.640> it<00:03:07.880> doesn't<00:03:07.910> make<00:03:08.180> any<00:03:08.390> sense<00:03:08.660> so<00:03:09.020> I<00:03:09.260> try

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:09.830 
like it doesn't make any sense so I try

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:13.510 
like it doesn't make any sense so I try
not<00:03:10.010> to<00:03:10.239> go<00:03:11.239> off<00:03:11.270> wait<00:03:12.080> only<00:03:12.590> I<00:03:12.830> try<00:03:13.130> to<00:03:13.160> go<00:03:13.370> off

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:13.520 
not to go off wait only I try to go off

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:15.610 
not to go off wait only I try to go off
like<00:03:13.700> I<00:03:14.060> don't<00:03:14.150> measure<00:03:14.510> myself<00:03:14.810> you<00:03:15.500> know

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
like I don't measure myself you know

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:17.050 
like I don't measure myself you know
like<00:03:15.830> take<00:03:16.010> a<00:03:16.040> tape<00:03:16.250> measure<00:03:16.459> around<00:03:16.550> my<00:03:16.880> waist

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060 
like take a tape measure around my waist

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:19.540 
like take a tape measure around my waist
and<00:03:17.360> everything<00:03:17.810> I<00:03:18.040> probably<00:03:19.040> should<00:03:19.310> start

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:19.550 
and everything I probably should start

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:22.930 
and everything I probably should start
I'm<00:03:19.730> probably<00:03:19.880> gonna<00:03:20.120> do<00:03:20.270> that<00:03:20.450> but<00:03:21.080> um<00:03:21.940> I'm

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:22.940 
I'm probably gonna do that but um I'm

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:27.040 
I'm probably gonna do that but um I'm
gonna<00:03:23.150> measure<00:03:23.750> myself<00:03:24.070> maybe<00:03:25.070> if<00:03:26.000> I<00:03:26.180> don't<00:03:26.930> be

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:27.050 
gonna measure myself maybe if I don't be

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:29.410 
gonna measure myself maybe if I don't be
lazy<00:03:27.230> and<00:03:27.500> I'll<00:03:27.920> put<00:03:28.130> it<00:03:28.250> in<00:03:28.370> the<00:03:29.060> description

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:29.420 
lazy and I'll put it in the description

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:33.130 
lazy and I'll put it in the description
so<00:03:30.410> i<00:03:30.440> can<00:03:30.770> compare<00:03:31.580> that<00:03:31.850> to<00:03:32.209> 40<00:03:32.750> days<00:03:32.930> from

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:33.140 
so i can compare that to 40 days from

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:36.550 
so i can compare that to 40 days from
now<00:03:33.550> so
