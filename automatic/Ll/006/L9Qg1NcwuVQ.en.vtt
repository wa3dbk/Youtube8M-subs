00:00:15.959 --> 00:00:15.969 
I like shiny things alright then you

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:17.150 
I like shiny things alright then you
guys<00:00:16.059> gonna<00:00:16.270> believe<00:00:16.540> this<00:00:16.750> but<00:00:16.990> this

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
guys gonna believe this but this

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.030 
guys gonna believe this but this
fiberglass<00:00:18.160> roof<00:00:18.430> is<00:00:18.730> not<00:00:19.450> fiberglass<00:00:20.040> it's

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:21.040 
fiberglass roof is not fiberglass it's

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:23.910 
fiberglass roof is not fiberglass it's
metal<00:00:21.790> we're<00:00:22.660> trying<00:00:22.930> to<00:00:23.020> drill<00:00:23.290> a<00:00:23.320> hole<00:00:23.439> and

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:23.920 
metal we're trying to drill a hole and

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:25.290 
metal we're trying to drill a hole and
we're<00:00:24.099> wondering<00:00:24.250> why<00:00:24.520> the<00:00:24.580> hell<00:00:24.880> we<00:00:25.029> can't

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:25.300 
we're wondering why the hell we can't

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:30.569 
we're wondering why the hell we can't
get<00:00:25.480> through<00:00:25.779> it<00:00:26.220> this<00:00:27.220> is<00:00:27.279> metal<00:00:29.340> it's<00:00:30.340> just

00:00:30.569 --> 00:00:30.579 
get through it this is metal it's just

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:33.360 
get through it this is metal it's just
coated<00:00:30.939> it's<00:00:31.599> actually<00:00:32.259> pretty<00:00:32.590> thick<00:00:32.980> metal

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:33.370 
coated it's actually pretty thick metal

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:35.729 
coated it's actually pretty thick metal
-<00:00:33.700> so<00:00:34.450> there's<00:00:34.660> two<00:00:34.899> layers<00:00:35.200> of<00:00:35.410> that

00:00:35.729 --> 00:00:35.739 
- so there's two layers of that

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:38.580 
- so there's two layers of that
thickness<00:00:36.250> of<00:00:36.399> metal<00:00:36.780> so<00:00:37.780> you<00:00:37.809> can't<00:00:38.140> just<00:00:38.380> pop

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:38.590 
thickness of metal so you can't just pop

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:40.020 
thickness of metal so you can't just pop
a<00:00:38.620> hole<00:00:38.890> in<00:00:39.070> the<00:00:39.160> side<00:00:39.309> of<00:00:39.489> it<00:00:39.579> like<00:00:39.610> you<00:00:39.850> could

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:40.030 
a hole in the side of it like you could

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:42.090 
a hole in the side of it like you could
with<00:00:40.180> most<00:00:40.390> class<00:00:41.079> B's<00:00:41.320> most<00:00:41.590> camper<00:00:41.920> vans

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:42.100 
with most class B's most camper vans

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:46.049 
with most class B's most camper vans
it's<00:00:42.700> actually<00:00:43.390> metal<00:00:44.460> there's<00:00:45.460> metal<00:00:45.760> then<00:00:45.969> a

00:00:46.049 --> 00:00:46.059 
it's actually metal there's metal then a

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:48.029 
it's actually metal there's metal then a
layer<00:00:46.269> of<00:00:46.300> int<00:00:46.660> card<00:00:47.170> foam<00:00:47.350> insulation<00:00:47.620> and

00:00:48.029 --> 00:00:48.039 
layer of int card foam insulation and

00:00:48.039 --> 00:00:50.610 
layer of int card foam insulation and
another<00:00:48.280> layer<00:00:48.489> metal<00:00:48.879> on<00:00:48.969> the<00:00:49.059> inside<00:00:49.089> so<00:00:49.989> you

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:50.620 
another layer metal on the inside so you

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:52.310 
another layer metal on the inside so you
know<00:00:50.739> all<00:00:50.859> those<00:00:50.949> people<00:00:51.010> that<00:00:51.429> tell<00:00:51.609> you<00:00:51.640> that

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
know all those people that tell you that

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.470 
know all those people that tell you that
explorers<00:00:53.320> are<00:00:53.469> very<00:00:53.679> well-built<00:00:54.129> yeah<00:00:54.940> the

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:55.480 
explorers are very well-built yeah the

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:57.209 
explorers are very well-built yeah the
proof<00:00:55.719> is<00:00:55.870> in<00:00:55.899> the<00:00:56.019> pudding<00:00:56.410> no<00:00:56.739> wonder<00:00:57.070> these

00:00:57.209 --> 00:00:57.219 
proof is in the pudding no wonder these

00:00:57.219 --> 00:00:59.759 
proof is in the pudding no wonder these
things<00:00:57.460> are<00:00:57.579> built<00:00:57.789> like<00:00:57.820> tanks<00:00:57.940> and<00:00:58.449> so<00:00:59.350> how

00:00:59.759 --> 00:00:59.769 
things are built like tanks and so how

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:01.619 
things are built like tanks and so how
do<00:00:59.829> we<00:00:59.920> figure<00:01:00.579> out<00:01:00.699> where<00:01:00.879> the<00:01:01.030> metal<00:01:01.269> is<00:01:01.359> and

00:01:01.619 --> 00:01:01.629 
do we figure out where the metal is and

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:02.910 
do we figure out where the metal is and
where<00:01:01.719> it<00:01:01.780> isn't<00:01:01.899> well<00:01:02.140> my<00:01:02.320> buddy<00:01:02.469> Vince<00:01:02.710> here

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:02.920 
where it isn't well my buddy Vince here

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.040 
where it isn't well my buddy Vince here
has<00:01:03.070> a<00:01:03.100> magnet<00:01:03.640> and<00:01:03.789> you<00:01:04.300> can<00:01:04.480> actually<00:01:04.600> feel

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:05.050 
has a magnet and you can actually feel

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:09.360 
has a magnet and you can actually feel
the<00:01:05.350> magnet<00:01:05.920> sucking<00:01:06.390> to<00:01:07.390> the<00:01:07.480> wall<00:01:07.860> where<00:01:08.860> the

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:09.370 
the magnet sucking to the wall where the

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:13.290 
the magnet sucking to the wall where the
where<00:01:09.730> the<00:01:09.880> metal<00:01:10.120> is<00:01:10.210> behind<00:01:10.540> it<00:01:11.940> but<00:01:12.940> if<00:01:13.060> I<00:01:13.150> go

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:13.300 
where the metal is behind it but if I go

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:17.160 
where the metal is behind it but if I go
over<00:01:13.330> there<00:01:14.640> no<00:01:15.640> more<00:01:15.850> magnetism<00:01:16.689> so<00:01:16.960> the

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:17.170 
over there no more magnetism so the

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:19.020 
over there no more magnetism so the
metal<00:01:17.439> stops<00:01:17.680> here<00:01:18.070> they<00:01:18.189> must<00:01:18.430> have<00:01:18.579> built<00:01:18.790> it

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:19.030 
metal stops here they must have built it

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.109 
metal stops here they must have built it
in<00:01:19.180> to<00:01:19.659> reinforce<00:01:20.250> the<00:01:21.250> extended<00:01:21.759> doorway

00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:22.119 
in to reinforce the extended doorway

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:25.609 
in to reinforce the extended doorway
here<00:01:22.590> and<00:01:23.590> then<00:01:23.710> I<00:01:23.799> went<00:01:23.950> around<00:01:24.070> here<00:01:24.670> and

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
here and then I went around here and

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.950 
here and then I went around here and
there's<00:01:26.619> some<00:01:26.860> metal<00:01:27.130> right<00:01:27.280> here<00:01:27.869> but<00:01:28.869> it

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:28.960 
there's some metal right here but it

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:31.740 
there's some metal right here but it
stops<00:01:29.259> oh<00:01:29.640> yeah<00:01:30.640> look<00:01:31.240> at<00:01:31.270> that<00:01:31.360> guys<00:01:31.630> you

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:31.750 
stops oh yeah look at that guys you

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:33.630 
stops oh yeah look at that guys you
could<00:01:31.899> get<00:01:32.020> magnetic<00:01:32.469> signs<00:01:33.280> for<00:01:33.549> your

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:33.640 
could get magnetic signs for your

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:35.209 
could get magnetic signs for your
business<00:01:33.969> and<00:01:34.119> stick<00:01:34.270> it<00:01:34.360> on<00:01:34.420> the<00:01:34.540> fiberglass

00:01:35.209 --> 00:01:35.219 
business and stick it on the fiberglass

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:52.710 
business and stick it on the fiberglass
so<00:01:36.219> fiberglass<00:01:37.090> coated<00:01:37.630> and<00:01:37.750> metal

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:52.720 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:55.749 

Explorer<00:01:53.720> owners<00:01:54.079> take<00:01:54.350> note<00:01:54.590> there<00:01:55.159> is<00:01:55.189> a<00:01:55.310> TV

00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:55.759 
Explorer owners take note there is a TV

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:58.749 
Explorer owners take note there is a TV
cable<00:01:55.970> in<00:01:56.840> the<00:01:57.259> foam<00:01:57.470> insulation<00:01:57.799> in<00:01:58.310> the<00:01:58.579> wall

00:01:58.749 --> 00:01:58.759 
cable in the foam insulation in the wall

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:02.350 
cable in the foam insulation in the wall
right<00:01:58.789> here<00:01:59.119> which<00:02:00.049> we<00:02:00.200> cut<00:02:00.409> through<00:02:01.210> but<00:02:02.210> it's

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:02.360 
right here which we cut through but it's

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:03.969 
right here which we cut through but it's
not<00:02:02.479> like<00:02:02.630> I<00:02:02.720> have<00:02:02.869> a<00:02:02.899> TV<00:02:03.110> up<00:02:03.350> on<00:02:03.470> this<00:02:03.590> end<00:02:03.770> so<00:02:03.920> I

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:03.979 
not like I have a TV up on this end so I

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:13.210 
not like I have a TV up on this end so I
don't<00:02:04.130> really<00:02:04.220> care

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.700 

she<00:02:14.090> was<00:02:14.180> a<00:02:14.210> motor<00:02:14.390> home<00:02:14.570> life<00:02:14.780> you<00:02:15.050> learn<00:02:15.530> to

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:15.710 
she was a motor home life you learn to

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:17.200 
she was a motor home life you learn to
be<00:02:15.800> a<00:02:15.830> minimalist<00:02:16.310> and<00:02:16.550> you<00:02:16.610> get<00:02:16.760> rid<00:02:16.880> of<00:02:16.910> junk

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:17.210 
be a minimalist and you get rid of junk

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:18.400 
be a minimalist and you get rid of junk
you<00:02:17.330> don't<00:02:17.360> need<00:02:17.570> which<00:02:17.900> just<00:02:18.110> weighs<00:02:18.260> you

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 
you don't need which just weighs you

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:20.890 
you don't need which just weighs you
down<00:02:18.730> you<00:02:19.730> know<00:02:19.760> less<00:02:20.180> stuff<00:02:20.420> more<00:02:20.600> freedom

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
down you know less stuff more freedom

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.890 
down you know less stuff more freedom
right<00:02:21.220> like<00:02:22.220> happily<00:02:22.550> Elsa<00:02:22.820> says<00:02:23.030> but<00:02:23.720> if<00:02:23.810> you

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
right like happily Elsa says but if you

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:25.570 
right like happily Elsa says but if you
don't<00:02:24.170> live<00:02:24.680> in<00:02:24.710> a<00:02:24.830> Motorhome<00:02:25.160> and<00:02:25.310> you<00:02:25.370> choose

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 
don't live in a Motorhome and you choose

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.910 
don't live in a Motorhome and you choose
to<00:02:25.610> own<00:02:26.090> a<00:02:26.120> home<00:02:26.450> you<00:02:27.260> end<00:02:27.380> up<00:02:27.470> having<00:02:27.740> to<00:02:27.830> do
