00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.730
 and today with the basha gameplay theme 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.240
 how do you get these better 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.240
 gameplay 

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:25.170
 so 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:28.260
 hardy hello and welcome 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.840
 youtube i am welcomed and welcome you 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.700
 very welcome to a new video, yes 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.170
 and today for you one free for all 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.150
 not me playing good on life 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.030
 map slums the whole with the pd dr 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:41.430
 pdw and what that looks like 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.340
 raiders then still lightweight 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:47.360
 and I give my skill per box 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:50.489
 it is not anymore and today with the topic 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:54.150
 basha gameplays how do you get 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:56.550
 These mugs are gameplay and important 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:58.080
 is first to say that black ops 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.670
 of course you are different than that 

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:01.080
 previous call of duty parts that can 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.300
 you actually participate alongside call of duty 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:04.170
 say but you have to killstreaks yourself 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.150
 have a look 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.860
 with the kids fix it is like that 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.710
 However, they are based on each other 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:13.080
 more like built up in black ops 1 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.690
 they build on each other, that is when 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.130
 I make a kill with one click 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:18.840
 and points for getting the points yes 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.760
 but that's not the goal 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.380
 not the kilwi those are the three at that time 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:25.590
 was but the points and mostly are 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:28.460
 it kicks 25 points and you need it 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.240
 mostly 100 points more for the next one 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:33.000
 kills away 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.549
 that's why you can actually be in one 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.009
 free for all do not assume yes 

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:39.539
 that really is the one 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.799
 bring killstreaks and lots of kids 

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:42.210
 and then make sure of it 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:45.930
 his other child got so 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:47.490
 The drone was packed here 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.979
 still the picture lightning and the fir 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.359
 is whether there simply is lightning 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.740
 just there for it okay, I'll come 

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:54.119
 a bit closer in the valley maybe 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.189
 then I make package with perhaps 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.990
 but not the drone is free in a 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:00.570
 more important for everyone because they are 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.039
 just for that there is that one the opponents 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.240
 on the wheel there sees that is important in 

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:05.219
 a case for all one knows beforehand 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.750
 opponents should come and in black ops 2 should 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:09.479
 We all know that by now 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.160
 there is no step until there is no step 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:14.640
 This park is also there once 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.660
 again ninja that one so his own 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.610
 steps are not of the adversaries 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.870
 belongs to which one hardly hears anyway and 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.240
 once you take the steps yourself 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:24.180
 adversary loud one hears oneself if one 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:26.850
 Both parks used in my opinion 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.920
 you can ears very bad ears 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:31.050
 So I'm really having problems with that 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.430
 I was always one of anyway no matter 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:34.190
 which game mode is always on sound 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.650
 has played especially in 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:37.550
 search and destroy and for all and there 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:38.990
 Of course I have the right one now 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:40.250
 I have problems with that 

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:40.940
 that's why it's and must be a bit 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:42.830
 do differently 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:44.090
 that 's why i am also a player of 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:45.560
 maybe not quite as good though 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:47.270
 Of course I try my best and 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:50.000
 maybe help me with drones that 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:52.640
 at 425 points that's in one case 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.860
 for all five kills in mw3 that was one 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:56.510
 Predator is pretty high though 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:58.010
 Maybe it helps me a bit because 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:59.360
 the other cage in one free for all 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:02.270
 not really much and you 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:03.380
 actually on yourself yes to yourself 

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:05.060
 even have to look that one with the 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:08.210
 weapon all kids does that too 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:10.730
 plunderer not so bad yes in 

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:12.470
 Other moody's domination would be me 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:15.530
 recommend the orbital satellites 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:19.010
 at 12,000 points and 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:22.100
 unlike, for example, the tagi league 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:24.260
 if the seat brings and yes if the 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:26.210
 opponent if your made in a kill 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:28.850
 power also brings you points 

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:30.320
 I think 25 or just 10 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:32.570
 In any case, you bring yourself too 

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:33.350
 points and suspects how head makes 25 

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:34.700
 Points 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:36.560
 And it's definitely worth more 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:37.940
 if you take the orbital satellite with you 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:39.170
 because then if you are still in a team 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:40.220
 plays worth more in any case 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:41.750
 I can tell you that 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:43.760
 That's how you get yours faster 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:45.410
 Of course you can killstreaks if 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:46.880
 you are so good and that 12 kids too 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:48.500
 you have to create it too 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:49.730
 Of course you then the video screen and 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:51.320
 maybe the lhotse with the or the 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:53.209
 dogs and two depending on how good you are 

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:54.890
 But that's actually how it is when you are 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:56.209
 on really high killstreaks i would 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:57.470
 join the orbital satellites for one 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:59.090
 real pescia gameplay i would like you 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:00.860
 recommended because you just see 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:04.280
 top left ok right there is the enemy 

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:06.500
 and this orbital satellite is simple 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:08.120
 better than for example in mw3 this 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:09.650
 support zone because that does not have to 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:12.140
 100 percent indicated where the opponent from 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:13.610
 Radar is and therefore I recommend you 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:15.019
 the try times touting me again 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:16.730
 in the comments what your favorite 

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:18.890
 kill switch are for a reign 

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:19.810
 match and forget will comment 

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:22.079
 and toni 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:22.079
 June 

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:41.130
 the laptop 

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:47.540
 Baghdad
