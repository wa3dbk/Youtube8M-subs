00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:07.230

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:16.020
 about comics do not have standards ovi 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:18.869
 dim company store and it was purchased 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:21.270
 It's been a while since comics are 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:24.900
 all star began to launch a series of 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.400
 horror comic based on movies and 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.070
 success series 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:32.750
 I have almost all and I'll tell 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:35.130
 you, despite the historical 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:36.780
 comics based on series and movies 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.239
 they have to be bad 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:44.190
 these are very good even by the creators 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:48.180
 involved starting short week is sad 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:51.270
 making an adaptation of the film was a 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:53.910
 famous film of being sad of the 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.160
 michael doguete is the movie until you have a 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.530
 participation of Anna Paquin vampire and 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:02.699
 movie is very very very cool 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:04.409
 then it is an adaptation is literal is not 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:08.040
 a free creation within the universe 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:11.790
 of the tweed is a literal adaptation of the 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:13.439
 movie that was very very very nice 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.930
 it's worth running after that stuff 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.400
 came out first with miniseries all 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.320
 the ones I show will actually be the 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.689
 first with the ministry and after that 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:25.020
 Binder binding format with spine 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:29.549
 square then getting sad is the first 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:33.689
 We came in after a recreation of 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:36.689
 file x nor what xdr files because it is 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:39.840
 model scania are back here in this 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:42.570
 in this recreation were four stories 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.850
 bound the first two 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.939
 written by the French pot limit with the 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:50.640
 written by the last margin and the 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:53.610
 fourth written by google this the 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:56.700
 Ride then only veterans and then you talk. 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.740
 but it should be a text dated 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.530
 even more based on the series that nothing 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.780
 very very very cool 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.250
 worth chase it here and 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.340
 especially for those who are in love 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:11.730
 how I grew up in the 1990s seeing 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:13.260
 series one of the best ddd series 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:17.340
 I have been produced in the history of 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:18.959
 Then there's the tip file x 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.830
 for you 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:23.069
 Now I'm going to confess one thing is 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:25.590
 front 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:28.170
 It was a series that was released I tried 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:30.870
 watch from her until she seems quite 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.799
 with file x I have a chance to 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.870
 she 

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:36.390
 three times I have to see the three do not 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:39.200
 me so captivated not move forward but 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:41.459
 I know the front have their 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:46.319
 ardent supporters 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:48.360
 I have not read this special yet is maybe 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:50.670
 I have some resistance because I 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:52.709
 not just liking the series is to 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:55.410
 today I have not read but I think it is 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:58.799
 Worth to show was it was a series that 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:00.720
 marked the season on TV and has its 

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:03.329
 his share of admirers 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:05.069
 So I thought it was worth it. 

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:06.810
 remembering and showing you that it was 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:09.810
 produced front material 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:12.000
 now the two surprises the bike then 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:14.430
 decided to take the two most 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.489
 consecrated terror of the 80's 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:20.959
 right next to halloween ii and released 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:24.319
 high quality material 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:29.310
 starting with nightmare on elm street 

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:32.880
 or the freddy krueger series is freddy 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:34.530
 krueger played by the eternal robert 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.970
 I'm not counting the 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:38.579
 reprint that is a horror 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:42.030
 runs away from the originals and series 

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:44.480
 was written by dixon shock and has it all 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:48.299
 that we most love the faith of a humor 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:52.800
 sagacious it black humor is look here one 

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:56.280
 beautiful drawing a beautiful work of art 

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:58.920
 it's worth those dream things 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:02.490
 crazy people can not do nice if 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:08.520
 become in the domains of fred and there 

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:10.620
 My friend there you danced sedans or else 

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:16.590
 already begins in the whole series obviously 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:18.360
 springwood was diverted by the cab 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:19.830
 west I do not remember much of others 

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:21.450
 No matter what works, but I liked it. 

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:24.630
 a lot of the work he does here 

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:28.590
 the series begins with a teenager already 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:31.260
 Fucking she's dreaming middle school. 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:33.390
 is attacked by fred snake a whore 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:34.440
 deleted die you die notions 

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:36.000
 dies in real life 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:38.970
 This is the proposal of nightmare on elm. 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.220
 street here the nightmare time and 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:43.110
 surprisingly, the last one occurs 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:45.090
 last code I want to show that 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:49.200
 It has everything to be a picture of the river that gives 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:52.110
 the donkeys in the water is Friday the 13th 

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:53.450
 put on a series of Friday 3 and will give 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:57.630
 right 

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:59.700
 improbability is not improbable except that the 

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:01.830
 authors are management by law 

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:04.800
 jimmy palmiotti asked me a couple who 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:07.740
 where they put their hands always gives a 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:09.900
 double whore in the comic worked in the 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:11.880
 first jonas rex series i think 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:13.770
 spectacular one of the best things in 

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:17.490
 sm have already been made 

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:20.160
 It's unfortunately in the comic strip. 

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:22.950
 stopped publishing in the sixth volume 

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:25.770
 deserved and to the end because it is very 

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:28.050
 very good and is a very consecrated couple 

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:30.690
 Speak, I'll get the money. What I'm going to 

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:33.030
 to do with it has to do has got 

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:34.950
 thing to do and the guys did well 

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:38.280
 steel goods zasso 

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:39.990
 so all this is unpublished material 

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:42.020
 nothing has been released in Brazil and is 

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:44.580
 unlikely to be in this 

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:48.360
 very rare uacs things come out 

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:50.520
 here outside the scope of superheroes but 

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:54.200
 even more and keep the article as well 

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:56.640
 here ends up generating between 2007 and 2008 

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:59.870
 now being can always chase after 

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:59.870
 incarnated, right? 

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:06.310
 some extinct Ithala this publisher 

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:10.710
 material happiness of great creators is 

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:10.710
 That's it, everyone, until the next flog.
