 Hello everyone from Bernardino 99 

00:00:40.609 --> 00:00:45.289
 today I wanted to play the theme song of the technician 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:47.750
 in the Japanese abbreviation because in practice 

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:49.550
 in detective conan she was like the 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:51.110
 carton my favorite carton to go o 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:52.760
 small small 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:55.850
 these days have succeeded in 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.619
 ring the initials and I wanted to put it 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:59.809
 even if maybe it doesn't interest many but 

00:00:57.619 --> 00:01:01.699
 I want to do the same 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:04.460
 ah I forgot to say sorry 

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:06.830
 mistakes those happen because I don't have it 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:09.789
 score plays ear and therefore is 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:09.789
 difficult to stay 

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:33.540
 Well
