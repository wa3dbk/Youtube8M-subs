 where they are not protected from 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:59.370
 frost because many plants do not like 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:03.480

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:05.640

 You can use vases on the stairs. 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:46.439
 under the stairs they spend a lot 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:49.049
 suitable for making a small garden 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:51.479
 then watch the video to learn 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:53.790
 more about this and from this week 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:56.549
 we also started back again 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:58.950
 continuity to our series plants

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.399
 We're going to be discussing some 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:10.580
 chassis benefits they bring to the 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.580
 Cheers 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:18.900
 the idea of ​​decorating with plants and today 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.000
 it's about succulents 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.520
 who has never loved the 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.170
 delicacy or versatility of these 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:27.660
 exotic plants 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.970
 It is best that succulents do not require 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:33.060
 many care and are plants indicated 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:35.550
 also to the interior of residences 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:38.880
 provided that they receive at least four 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:41.670
 Solar heat poetry hours should be 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:44.460
 grown in rich soil and waits for a 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:48.390
 once a week in the summer and every 15 days 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:51.030
 In winter never leaves standing water in the 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:52.680
 so you guarantee that they 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:55.710
 develop their forms well 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:57.990
 and leaves that prevail 

00:02:55.710 --> 00:03:00.540
 greens throughout the year 

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:02.880
 most of these plants are well 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:05.460
 small and can be allocated in 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:07.860
 environment of your residence and 

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:13.190
 also used to form gardens 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:13.190
 vertical as well as beautiful in pots 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:21.060
 the question of the week of evandro gomes de 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:24.570
 mouth of the iguana in parana 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:27.210
 He wants to know when to turn the grass. 

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:29.670
 good rain is what determines the period 

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:32.310
 of the lawn khost since the amount 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:34.620
 rainfall directly affects the process of 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:37.050
 growth of the plant when it is 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:40.170
 raining very hard and constantly 

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:42.720
 for several days the grass ends up growing 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:45.150
 faster and the cut should be done 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:46.950
 then every 15 days 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:49.170
 if the weather is dry in winter 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:50.310
 when the leaves take longer to 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:53.640
 arise 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:55.920
 it is not advisable to prune eight 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:04:02.850
 is the ideal size for the 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:05.640
 grassy green lawn and I would like 

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:08.370
 to take advantage of and suggest the people 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:11.730
 have seen many maracás flowered by 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:14.100
 then grow that plant one in the face 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:17.130
 found much in the past since a 

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:20.170
 typical tree a typical plant of the forest 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:23.080
 at that time 

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:25.300
 here by all the corners of the country many 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:27.850
 and nowadays this plant no longer 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:31.390
 is as easily found as before 

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:34.090
 then continues on k has a variety of 

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:36.700
 manacá of the saw known as naná that 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:39.550
 It's a little tree, it does not 

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:41.850
 3 meters high, it is ideal for 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:44.770
 be planted on sidewalks and gardens 

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:47.560
 because the roots are not aggressive 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:50.020
 so it will not break the sidewalk and the good 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:52.030
 is that the plant begins to flow from 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:54.190
 of 50 centimeters 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:56.590
 So since she's young, she's starting to give 

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:59.800
 those beautiful flowers have stained 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:02.020
 white homes soy then there is no 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:04.480
 Growing up in the house is fine, I'm going 

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:06.780
 staying here in 15 days I'm 

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:09.760
