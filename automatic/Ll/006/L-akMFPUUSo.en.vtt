what's different on this amp from the
Rev<00:01:04.949> plus<00:01:05.339> is<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:06.240> addition<00:01:06.930> of<00:01:07.080> a<00:01:07.770> main

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
the power section the louder you turn

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.469 
the power section the louder you turn
this<00:01:13.799> up<00:01:14.100> it's<00:01:14.400> going<00:01:14.640> to<00:01:14.700> work<00:01:14.790> directly<00:01:15.240> with

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
how loud you're going to push the power

how loud you're going to push the power
tubes<00:01:17.340> the<00:01:17.880> way<00:01:18.060> this<00:01:18.210> amps<00:01:18.509> really<00:01:18.900> designed

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
tubes the way this amps really designed

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.130 
tubes the way this amps really designed
is<00:01:19.530> to<00:01:19.740> keep<00:01:20.070> the<00:01:20.280> main<00:01:20.490> master<00:01:21.119> up<00:01:21.270> above<00:01:21.750> the

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
is to keep the main master up above the

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.410 
is to keep the main master up above the
master<00:01:22.590> one<00:01:22.770> in<00:01:22.950> the<00:01:23.009> master<00:01:23.220> two<00:01:23.610> to<00:01:24.090> keep<00:01:24.210> the

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
master one in the master two to keep the

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.060 
master one in the master two to keep the
circuit<00:01:24.810> from<00:01:24.960> getting<00:01:25.229> a<00:01:25.290> little<00:01:25.500> squirrely

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
circuit from getting a little squirrely

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.460 
circuit from getting a little squirrely
the<00:01:26.580> other<00:01:26.700> difference<00:01:27.119> on<00:01:27.270> this<00:01:27.420> amp<00:01:27.720> is<00:01:27.869> its

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
the other difference on this amp is its

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.410 
the other difference on this amp is its
reavoice<00:01:28.979> with<00:01:29.400> a<00:01:29.430> little<00:01:29.759> bit<00:01:29.850> more<00:01:30.030> gain

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
reavoice with a little bit more gain

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.830 
reavoice with a little bit more gain
dimed<00:01:31.170> was<00:01:31.619> definitely<00:01:32.189> a<00:01:32.220> Gainey<00:01:32.490> act<00:01:32.790> like<00:01:33.600> a

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
dimed was definitely a Gainey act like a

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.740 
dimed was definitely a Gainey act like a
lot<00:01:34.409> of<00:01:34.439> game<00:01:34.829> so<00:01:35.310> we<00:01:35.850> basically<00:01:36.119> have<00:01:36.479> added

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
lot of game so we basically have added

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.050 
lot of game so we basically have added
more<00:01:36.960> in<00:01:37.110> to<00:01:37.290> accommodate<00:01:37.829> that<00:01:37.860> it's<00:01:38.790> pretty

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
more in to accommodate that it's pretty

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.270 
more in to accommodate that it's pretty
rough-and-tumble<00:01:39.390> app<00:01:39.930> on<00:01:40.290> the<00:01:40.799> clean<00:01:41.009> side

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
rough-and-tumble app on the clean side

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.969 
rough-and-tumble app on the clean side
dime<00:01:42.090> like<00:01:42.360> a<00:01:42.570> lot<00:01:42.810> of<00:01:42.960> spank<00:01:43.380> and<00:01:43.649> a<00:01:43.740> little

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
dime like a lot of spank and a little

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.249 
dime like a lot of spank and a little
bit<00:01:44.130> of<00:01:44.220> grit<00:01:44.430> on<00:01:44.579> is<00:01:44.729> clean<00:01:45.000> channel<00:01:45.420> so<00:01:45.840> it's

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
bit of grit on is clean channel so it's

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.950 
bit of grit on is clean channel so it's
a<00:01:46.320> very<00:01:46.530> shiny<00:01:47.060> somewhat<00:01:48.060> dirty<00:01:48.479> kind<00:01:48.780> of<00:01:48.899> a

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
a very shiny somewhat dirty kind of a

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.240 
a very shiny somewhat dirty kind of a
clean<00:01:49.229> tone<00:01:49.530> but<00:01:50.340> very<00:01:50.820> Texas<00:01:51.420> very<00:01:52.140> Texas<00:01:52.829> so

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
clean tone but very Texas very Texas so

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.940 
clean tone but very Texas very Texas so
the<00:01:53.759> crankenstein<00:01:54.329> plus<00:01:54.869> like<00:01:55.290> the<00:01:55.470> Rev<00:01:55.619> Plus

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950
