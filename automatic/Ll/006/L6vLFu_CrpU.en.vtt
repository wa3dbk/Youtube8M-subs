00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
alright these are the NC scopes this is

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:09.770 
alright these are the NC scopes this is
the<00:00:07.350> first<00:00:07.799> one<00:00:08.040> the<00:00:08.220> 3.4<00:00:09.120> times<00:00:09.150> the<00:00:09.540> laser

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
the first one the 3.4 times the laser

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.740 
the first one the 3.4 times the laser
scope<00:00:10.200> is<00:00:11.330> actually<00:00:12.330> a<00:00:12.360> really<00:00:12.540> nice

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
scope is actually a really nice

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:13.910 
scope is actually a really nice
crosshair<00:00:13.290> I<00:00:13.349> think<00:00:13.530> it's<00:00:13.620> one<00:00:13.740> of<00:00:13.769> my

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
crosshair I think it's one of my

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.760 
crosshair I think it's one of my
favorite<00:00:14.250> crosshairs<00:00:14.820> in<00:00:15.570> the<00:00:15.750> game<00:00:15.929> this<00:00:16.590> is

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
favorite crosshairs in the game this is

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.779 
favorite crosshairs in the game this is
the<00:00:16.890> four<00:00:17.250> times<00:00:17.520> scope

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.569 

with<00:00:21.390> which<00:00:21.990> is<00:00:22.169> really<00:00:22.470> boxy<00:00:22.980> but<00:00:23.310> has<00:00:23.550> a

00:00:23.569 --> 00:00:23.579 
with which is really boxy but has a

00:00:23.579 --> 00:00:25.880 
with which is really boxy but has a
decent<00:00:23.789> crosser<00:00:24.300> this<00:00:25.169> is<00:00:25.320> the<00:00:25.470> sixth<00:00:25.859> time

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
decent crosser this is the sixth time

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.189 
decent crosser this is the sixth time
scope<00:00:26.519> which<00:00:27.000> is<00:00:27.210> similar<00:00:27.539> to<00:00:27.810> the<00:00:27.899> default

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
scope which is similar to the default

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.859 
scope which is similar to the default
sniper<00:00:28.589> rifle<00:00:28.949> scope<00:00:29.189> and<00:00:29.399> as<00:00:30.300> a<00:00:30.329> result<00:00:30.509> also

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
sniper rifle scope and as a result also

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.860 
sniper rifle scope and as a result also
blocks<00:00:31.380> the<00:00:31.649> peripheral<00:00:32.040> vision<00:00:32.690> but<00:00:33.690> it<00:00:33.780> will

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
blocks the peripheral vision but it will

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.389 
blocks the peripheral vision but it will
compromise<00:00:34.079> there<00:00:34.500> this<00:00:34.739> is<00:00:34.860> the<00:00:34.890> alternate

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
compromise there this is the alternate

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:40.310 
compromise there this is the alternate
for<00:00:35.610> time<00:00:35.760> scope<00:00:36.649> it<00:00:37.649> down<00:00:37.980> as<00:00:38.970> a<00:00:39.600> fainter

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320

I<00:01:44.659> like<00:01:45.229> it<00:01:45.380> this<00:01:45.950> is<00:01:46.100> the<00:01:46.280> a<00:01:46.310> times<00:01:46.670> let's<00:01:47.060> go

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:48.220 
I like it this is the a times let's go

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:51.850 
I like it this is the a times let's go
kind<00:01:49.220> of<00:01:49.250> looks<00:01:49.460> like<00:01:49.520> a<00:01:49.610> TR<00:01:50.150> scope<00:01:50.860> which

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:51.860 
kind of looks like a TR scope which

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:54.130 
kind of looks like a TR scope which
isn't<00:01:52.159> bad<00:01:52.189> and<00:01:52.549> this<00:01:53.180> is<00:01:53.330> the<00:01:53.479> seven<00:01:53.869> times

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:54.140 
isn't bad and this is the seven times

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:58.180 
isn't bad and this is the seven times
scope<00:01:54.619> which<00:01:55.390> basically<00:01:56.830> looks<00:01:57.830> kind<00:01:58.100> of<00:01:58.130> like

00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:58.190 
scope which basically looks kind of like

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:03.120 
scope which basically looks kind of like
a<00:01:58.280> doll<00:01:58.490> rancher<00:01:58.880> I<00:01:59.320> must<00:02:00.320> say<00:02:00.439> so
