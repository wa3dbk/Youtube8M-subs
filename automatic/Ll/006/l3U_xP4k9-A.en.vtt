00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:15.509
 gambling represents drafts sharply 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.369
 slammed the door to the marauder to and 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:20.189
 without being wound up to the limit 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.890
 turns around frightened and not looking 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:25.400
 pulls the trigger who knew that on the line 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:28.260
 fire seems a cheerful guy 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:30.119
 out of the most hopeless 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.059
 scrapes after a few seconds 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:35.850
 villains revenge shot in the stomach but 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.590
 clementine lost another friend 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.559
 it is no easier 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:43.890
 walked the first minutes of the second season walking 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.370
 dead heroes do not die from shots 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.530
 at random 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:50.460
 I want to click in the face of the director but 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:53.879
 the director shakes his head now dying 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:56.070
 the time of heroes is gone the time of people 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:59.010
 beginning of the history of the second season 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:01.500
 it came out completely unsystematically clementine 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:04.229
 one and a half hours was stormy on the roads 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.320
 rivers of life, too, fate awaited all of her 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.790
 future flight companions 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:11.580
 uncertainty and full of inner 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:14.640
 confusion and so it will be until the very end 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:17.759
 plans fail goals blurred methods 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:20.580
 hopeless 2 season for street king bed 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:23.159
 real kaleidoscope of bad luck with that 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.799
 face the hero survives only by miracle 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:28.680
 after the bitter first season which 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:32.729
 at least a little but it inspired optimism 2 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:35.040
 seemingly reference despair and despondency even 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:38.759
 when heroes are finally 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:41.369
 sacred purpose what they do begin 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:45.090
 quarrel with each other and greedily hold on 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:47.220
 for their vices at all in the new season 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.649
 whole three independent ending with 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.720
 significant options are a few 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:53.310
 distinguishes the novelty from other games telltale 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.979
 where is the ending 1 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.360
 but with a few facets there are places here 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:00.360
 and a tearful finale 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:03.149
 and to the new flight, but the most elegant among 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:05.460
 endings is the saddest thing in 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:07.659
 authors had enough creative forces 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:10.319
 repeat and write new 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:12.849
 unusual and to everyone's dismay 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:13.660
 plausible story about the weak and 

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:16.510
 strong people 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:19.239
 Teltel made a story about changeable and 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:24.010
 fragile human essence and images 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:26.379
 selected not from weak day and the embodiment 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:27.160
 responsibility in the first season he 

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:29.530
 lost everything 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:32.530
 and now turned from decisive 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:35.980
 blooming men in the indifferent killed 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:39.010
 grieved figure having lost the meaning of life he 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:41.769
 became brutal rough harsh and requires 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:44.769
 complete obedience to him is something more visible as 

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:46.840
 save your poor ass alone 

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:49.060
 clementine pulls out a beginner 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.920
 despot and does not give his hands warm blood 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:54.489
 or not pulling back 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:56.950
 you decide smartly and girl jane 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:59.560
 personification of freedom and avoiding 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:01.420
 responsibility if not for this she 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:04.299
 would seem stereotypical soldier kai 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:05.980
 even they are suitable jane a lot 

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:08.560
 survived lost sister 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:11.560
 but the lesson I learned from my troubles 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:14.859
 such as other heroes the key to survival 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.250
 loneliness companions burden pulling on 

00:03:14.859 --> 00:03:18.900
 bottom 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:21.910
 and any group is doomed to collapse gibi 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:24.220
 this is a confrontation of two elements in the second 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:26.859
 the season has become key on one side 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:29.099
 mutual help moron heroism and 

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:32.019
 mythical fortress town of wellington 

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:34.690
 guiding star for kenya and its rare 

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:36.549
 supporters and bitter freedom from 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:38.889
 responsibility by the other 

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:41.609
 at the end they face head to head but 

00:03:38.889 --> 00:03:44.079
 it turns out to fight no one else 

00:03:41.609 --> 00:03:46.120
 brutal savior and eternal 

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:48.280
 traitor they will be to the last 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:50.950
 sigh fight for your ideas 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:54.040
 and making your choice will put a brilliant 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:56.290
 point of tense narration in 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:58.630
 difference from the first season in passing 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:01.510
 much more uniform narration 

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:03.819
 each series creates new conflicts and 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:05.799
 new countermeasures only fourth 

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:07.810
 almost entirely devoted to search 

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:10.110
 shelter for one pregnant 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:13.000
 we are ugly with ugly temper 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:15.489
 promised tl dl nonlinearity we both 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.820
 not seen but nose later their 

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:20.680
 player actions poke regularly logic 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:23.770
 same these same actions here where 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:26.560
 Obviously we are tired of giving out 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:29.500
 telltale bake and and tweaks for their barbaric 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:31.570
 policy on the appearance of the game is not 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:33.550
 forces shading comic graphic 

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:36.730
 style is a very good solution when 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:39.520
 limited budget but animated facial expressions 

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:42.100
 suffer incessantly any 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:44.350
 dramatic scene is smeared due 

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:46.990
 semi paralyzed persons and awkward 

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:49.780
 movements and scenes where heroes cry 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:52.210
 entirely at the mercy of voice actors 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:53.830
 but there are no complaints about them 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:55.990
 for okenden 

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:57.820
 can not repeat and talent 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:05:00.100
 open the topic for which they took 

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:03.100
 Script writers abound 

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:05.560
 expressive heroes and antiheroes he 

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:07.930
 learned to deeply impress a player not 

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:10.150
 only squeezing tears in the second season 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:12.760
 there are weak points but in terms of 

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:13.360
 mechanics he did not evolve on 

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:16.330
 iota 

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:19.500
 but still this work is much more 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:19.500
 thin than 1
