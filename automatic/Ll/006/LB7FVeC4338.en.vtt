00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
actually going to get really small curls

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.359 
actually going to get really small curls
from<00:01:45.899> this<00:01:46.110> so<00:01:46.470> if<00:01:46.649> you<00:01:46.710> want<00:01:46.860> bigger<00:01:47.040> curls

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
from this so if you want bigger curls

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.580 
from this so if you want bigger curls
make<00:01:47.850> your<00:01:48.000> sections<00:01:48.390> a<00:01:48.479> lot<00:01:48.720> bigger<00:01:49.020> and<00:01:49.380> I'm

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
make your sections a lot bigger and I'm

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.880 
make your sections a lot bigger and I'm
just<00:01:49.710> repeating<00:01:50.130> the<00:01:50.159> process<00:01:50.640> the<00:01:50.759> steps<00:01:51.090> um

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:51.890 
just repeating the process the steps um

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:54.560 
just repeating the process the steps um
twisting<00:01:52.890> the<00:01:53.009> hair<00:01:53.280> and<00:01:53.520> actually<00:01:54.060> spin<00:01:54.420> it

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
twisting the hair and actually spin it

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.359 
twisting the hair and actually spin it
the<00:01:54.720> tighter<00:01:55.049> you<00:01:55.229> make<00:01:55.439> it<00:01:55.619> that's<00:01:55.799> the<00:01:56.070> key

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
the tighter you make it that's the key

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.450 
the tighter you make it that's the key
to<00:01:57.119> getting<00:01:57.390> a<00:01:57.719> really<00:01:57.960> nice<00:01:58.229> curl<00:01:58.710> and<00:01:59.130> use

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
to getting a really nice curl and use

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.940 
to getting a really nice curl and use
one<00:01:59.790> hand<00:02:00.119> to<00:02:00.509> spin<00:02:00.899> and<00:02:01.229> actually<00:02:01.530> guide<00:02:01.740> the

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
one hand to spin and actually guide the

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.990 
one hand to spin and actually guide the
twist<00:02:02.420> around<00:02:03.420> the<00:02:03.840> bantu<00:02:04.229> knot<00:02:04.500> and<00:02:04.799> one<00:02:05.670> hand

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
twist around the bantu knot and one hand

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.300 
twist around the bantu knot and one hand
to<00:02:06.299> actually<00:02:06.600> hold<00:02:06.840> it<00:02:07.020> taut<00:02:07.229> and<00:02:07.469> just<00:02:08.039> spin

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
to actually hold it taut and just spin

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.040 
to actually hold it taut and just spin
it<00:02:08.459> as<00:02:08.610> tight<00:02:08.970> as<00:02:09.179> you<00:02:09.239> can<00:02:09.450> not<00:02:09.629> too<00:02:09.810> tight

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
it as tight as you can not too tight

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.949 
it as tight as you can not too tight
like<00:02:10.289> you<00:02:10.379> don't<00:02:10.560> want<00:02:10.679> to<00:02:10.709> headache<00:02:11.069> but<00:02:11.760> um

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
like you don't want to headache but um

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:14.750 
like you don't want to headache but um
the<00:02:13.230> tightness<00:02:13.530> definitely<00:02:14.250> helps<00:02:14.549> with<00:02:14.670> the

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
the tightness definitely helps with the

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.660 
the tightness definitely helps with the
definition<00:02:15.329> of<00:02:15.510> the<00:02:15.659> curl<00:02:16.010> so<00:02:17.010> just<00:02:17.220> spin<00:02:17.519> it

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
definition of the curl so just spin it

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.819 
definition of the curl so just spin it
towards<00:02:18.060> the<00:02:18.150> bottom<00:02:18.329> keep<00:02:19.260> wrapping<00:02:19.680> around

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:19.829 
towards the bottom keep wrapping around

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:22.160 
towards the bottom keep wrapping around
the<00:02:20.069> bottom<00:02:20.430> of<00:02:20.579> the<00:02:20.700> band<00:02:20.909> -<00:02:21.120> I'm<00:02:21.930> going<00:02:22.110> to

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
the bottom of the band - I'm going to

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.770 
the bottom of the band - I'm going to
show<00:02:22.230> you<00:02:22.349> one<00:02:22.620> more<00:02:22.769> time<00:02:23.239> all<00:02:24.239> you're<00:02:24.480> doing

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
show you one more time all you're doing

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.800 
show you one more time all you're doing
is<00:02:24.959> spinning<00:02:25.670> and<00:02:26.670> go<00:02:26.939> to<00:02:27.000> the<00:02:27.239> root<00:02:27.510> of<00:02:27.659> the

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
is spinning and go to the root of the

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.360 
is spinning and go to the root of the
hair<00:02:27.989> when<00:02:28.200> you<00:02:28.319> wrap<00:02:28.799> the<00:02:28.950> twists<00:02:29.220> around

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
hair when you wrap the twists around

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.050 
hair when you wrap the twists around
keep<00:02:29.819> it<00:02:29.970> around<00:02:30.239> the<00:02:30.959> bottom<00:02:31.500> of<00:02:31.739> the<00:02:32.549> bantu

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
keep it around the bottom of the bantu

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.869 
keep it around the bottom of the bantu
knot<00:02:33.810> and<00:02:34.260> continue<00:02:34.799> to<00:02:34.890> spend<00:02:35.189> around<00:02:35.310> and

00:02:35.869 --> 00:02:35.879 
knot and continue to spend around and

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:39.349 
knot and continue to spend around and
around<00:02:36.030> and<00:02:36.629> around<00:02:37.250> like<00:02:38.250> that<00:02:38.489> yes<00:02:38.849> yes<00:02:39.090> yes

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
really doesn't take a super long time to

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.220 
really doesn't take a super long time to
do<00:02:44.819> it<00:02:44.909> especially<00:02:45.000> get<00:02:45.480> the<00:02:45.540> hang<00:02:45.780> of<00:02:45.959> it

leaning<00:02:54.090> some<00:02:54.480> are<00:02:54.750> loose<00:02:55.129> but<00:02:56.129> when<00:02:56.819> it<00:02:56.940> comes

00:02:57.349 --> 00:02:57.359 
leaning some are loose but when it comes

00:02:57.359 --> 00:02:59.089 
leaning some are loose but when it comes

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239 
the key has to let it drop completely if

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:13.550 
the key has to let it drop completely if
you<00:03:12.269> don't<00:03:12.629> let<00:03:12.750> it<00:03:12.780> dry<00:03:12.959> completely<00:03:12.989> it's

would have been this tight if I want to
lift<00:03:25.919> them<00:03:26.099> in<00:03:26.310> so<00:03:26.519> long<00:03:26.549> like<00:03:26.940> let<00:03:27.150> them<00:03:27.269> sit

00:03:27.619 --> 00:03:27.629 
lift them in so long like let them sit

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:29.629 
lift them in so long like let them sit
for<00:03:27.810> so<00:03:28.079> long<00:03:28.290> you<00:03:28.859> can<00:03:29.040> see<00:03:29.220> how<00:03:29.340> tight<00:03:29.400> the

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:29.639 
for so long you can see how tight the

00:03:29.639 --> 00:03:32.780 
for so long you can see how tight the
curls<00:03:30.060> are<00:03:30.209> there<00:03:30.540> so<00:03:31.530> remember<00:03:32.159> the<00:03:32.310> smaller

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
curls are there so remember the smaller

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:36.289 
curls are there so remember the smaller
the<00:03:33.030> bantu<00:03:33.629> knot<00:03:33.870> the<00:03:34.739> smaller<00:03:35.099> the<00:03:35.280> curl<00:03:35.579> the

00:03:36.289 --> 00:03:36.299 
the bantu knot the smaller the curl the

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:37.939 
the bantu knot the smaller the curl the
bigger<00:03:36.569> the<00:03:36.750> bantu<00:03:37.079> knot<00:03:37.290> the<00:03:37.530> bigger<00:03:37.769> the

00:03:37.939 --> 00:03:37.949 
bigger the bantu knot the bigger the

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:42.589 
bigger the bantu knot the bigger the
curl<00:03:38.220> I<00:03:40.669> like<00:03:41.669> to<00:03:41.760> take<00:03:41.940> them<00:03:42.090> down<00:03:42.120> by

00:03:42.589 --> 00:03:42.599 
curl I like to take them down by

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:45.199 
curl I like to take them down by
unraveling<00:03:43.319> it<00:03:43.500> the<00:03:43.650> opposite<00:03:44.129> way<00:03:44.190> the<00:03:44.849> twist

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.209 
unraveling it the opposite way the twist

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:47.839 
unraveling it the opposite way the twist
and<00:03:45.540> then<00:03:46.079> pulling<00:03:46.440> the<00:03:46.620> twists<00:03:46.889> apart<00:03:47.430> it's

00:03:47.839 --> 00:03:47.849 
and then pulling the twists apart it's

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:49.640 
and then pulling the twists apart it's
definitely<00:03:48.209> easier<00:03:48.569> and<00:03:49.019> you're<00:03:49.139> cut<00:03:49.349> down<00:03:49.530> on

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
definitely easier and you're cut down on

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:51.500 
definitely easier and you're cut down on
tangles<00:03:50.129> and<00:03:50.459> as<00:03:50.760> you<00:03:50.909> can<00:03:51.030> see<00:03:51.239> I<00:03:51.269> got<00:03:51.479> some

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.510 
tangles and as you can see I got some

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:54.080 
tangles and as you can see I got some
