00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.440
 hello to all and welcome to this 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.089
 jumbo ap presentation video 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:09.540
 first start with his 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:11.250
 connectivity and its design the job up 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.889
 present as a plastic bracelet 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.269
 high quality indeed jawbone the 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:15.839
 wind like a quality bracelet 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.990
 medical 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:20.150
 hypoallergenic it is flexible and very 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.949
 easy to beat 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:25.680
 indeed his positioning on the arm 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.900
 is really easy because of its flexibility 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.330
 he is very pleasant and breathes the 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.340
 solidity it is removed and positioned 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.140
 on the arm however he remains well 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.850
 attached to this one aggression 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:42.059
 opening that may seem sensitive 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:42.690
 so remove it very easily at the level of 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.149
 connectivity 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.760
 the bracelet is very simple a button 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:50.039
 unique with different functions with 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.120
 glasses that indicates the activity supported 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:54.300
 relentlessly and allows you to change 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:57.690
 sleep or active / active mode presented by 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.579
 a sun and sleep not a moon a 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.039
 double click with one last presses have it 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:04.920
 does so in Prague the chronometer and 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:07.110
 it's the hood pulls out and lets 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.420
 appear a jack for the 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.890
 sync and charge 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.689
 however a small flat from this 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.850
 hood it looks pretty easy to 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.659
 lose and so what is its sustainability 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.509
 is in question 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:20.520
 at the day-to-day use level the 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.840
 djia good to boussu everywhere he 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.000
 record your steps with the pedometer 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.189
 integrated and knows what is 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.530
 a step and it's not it if the 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:31.170
 accuracy is not 100% reliable she 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.090
 remains as pretty correct and moreover he 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.380
 is possible to calibrate the bracelet there 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.720
 is extremely water resistant 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.340
 jawbone communicates little by cons on 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.229
 its limits and its limits to water 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.000
 tested in a swimming pool without problem 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.189
 but I remain calm skeptical about 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.370
 sealing in this case in a shower 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:48.680
 no problem 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:50.720
 for your bracelet to work 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:51.980
 must of course energy this 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.440
 energy is brought through this 

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:55.670
 usb adapter supplied in the box of a 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.710
 facts it allows you to reload 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:58.250
 your wood is only with this 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:59.840
 adapter 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:02.030
 no need to plug into your box and 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.940
 on the jack of your phone or 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:07.550
 from your computer this will not look for 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:09.290
 not a little red light indicates the heap 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:10.610
 charging the battery during diÃ© 

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:13.310
 lasts about ten days what is 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:15.620
 considerable the job man is capable of 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:19.370
 detect your an activity where your 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:21.500
 sleep for example throughout the 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.970
 day and at different phases our 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.820
 bracelet up records information 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:28.220
 that only the app up can read 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:29.600
 the up app is available on 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:33.890
 ios devices 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:35.450
 from there go there or 5.1 ipad or 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:36.020
 iphone and divisions devices 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:37.460
 android 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:39.410
 you have to know that for the devices 

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:40.670
 android is much more limited because 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:43.790
 very few devices are really 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:45.380
 compatible the application presents itself 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:46.940
 like a social network where you can 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:48.250
 follow people is constituted what we 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:50.450
 call a team 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:51.770
 why to collect the data there 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:53.989
 you just have to remove the cap from 

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:56.860
 your bracelet plug the jack 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:59.150
 and so the synchronization is done 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:59.630
 our brewery does not charge with 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.640
 the Iphone 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:02.900
 detection is fast and the 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:04.010
 synchronization may seem slow at 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.320
 beginning but in the end she is 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:07.670
 relatively fast 

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:09.560
 the indication of the battery his record is 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:12.050
 so by pressing continue you 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:16.100
 add gradually is not the 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:17.780
 sleep that you have harvested the 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:19.310
 sleep analysis function is to my 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:21.050
 most interesting eyes of this bracelet 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:22.880
 because it allows you to see how 

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:24.350
 you sleep at different phases and 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.850
 your different revealed during the night 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:27.500
 nor is it totally 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:29.420
 reliable as the pedometer 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:33.080
 but that's still really 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:34.670
 clear all alarm settings and 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:37.130
 inactivity alert are done directly 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:39.739
 from the app by plugging in 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:42.230
 your bracelet this and that to the length 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:43.940
 maybe a little annoying of Toulouse ii 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:46.250
 always plugged in without a bracelet for 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:48.920
 make any adjustments or add you 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:51.830
 directly to wake up with their is 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:53.930
 also the background of the temporal ie 

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:55.880
 than for example to program them your 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:56.780
 wake up at 9 o'clock and you put a 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:58.670
 fade 20 minutes 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:59.810
 and if the detector bracelet of our 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:02.569
 sleep phase 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:03.620
 is ideal for an alarm clock he will send you 

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:06.110
 by vibrations 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:07.340
 it's really effective and it's 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:09.950
 really the most interesting feature 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:12.410
 of this bracelet the pesky side is from 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:13.550
 always a register and like here all 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:14.980
 the changes we make on their 

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:17.600
 bracelet 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:19.970
 the right menu is made for 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:22.300
 synchronize and add sessions 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:24.980
 sports do not sleep etc 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:26.900
 Ab shares left without especially 

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:28.970
 centered on your profile and on life 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:30.650
 you have that bracelet could 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:33.110
 share emotions through this 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:35.479
 little emoticon that allow to have 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:37.280
 a social rendering of the application but 

00:04:35.479 --> 00:04:39.260
 also at the feeding level 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:41.960
 you can share what you eat 

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:43.370
 and also follow a caloric assessment there 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:44.600
 has a lot of products available but 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:46.639
 this function is in my eyes not 

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:48.320
 frankly interesting apart if you 

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:49.490
 follow a strict diet and that you 

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:50.870
 want to follow a diet 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:52.930
 you can of course disable 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:54.889
 share functions in settings 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:56.210
 to conclude we can say that the 

00:04:54.889 --> 00:04:59.240
 bracelet up is really a product 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:01.010
 interesting enough in the sense that he 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:03.080
 accompanies your life and goes beyond 

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:05.150
 necessarily centered on sports he 

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:07.550
 is not flawless indeed the price 

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:09.440
 130 euros and maybe a little high the 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:10.820
 synchronization with the jack and 

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:12.830
 no for bluetouff maybe a little 

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:14.390
 binding and so this brings into play 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:16.100
 its durability is what we really 

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:17.780
 use it in time if you have 

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:20.410
 liked do not hesitate to subscribe to see 

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:20.410
 but other video
