at<00:01:11.119> the<00:01:11.569> case<00:01:12.109> itself<00:01:12.469> so<00:01:13.369> here<00:01:13.729> is<00:01:13.880> the

00:01:14.109 --> 00:01:14.119 
at the case itself so here is the

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:16.809 
at the case itself so here is the
Griffin<00:01:14.479> Elan<00:01:14.869> I'd<00:01:15.859> already<00:01:16.279> forgot<00:01:16.579> the<00:01:16.700> name

00:01:16.809 --> 00:01:16.819 
Griffin Elan I'd already forgot the name

00:01:16.819 --> 00:01:20.589 
Griffin Elan I'd already forgot the name
of<00:01:16.849> it<00:01:17.060> the<00:01:17.209> Elan<00:01:17.689> folios<00:01:18.170> slim<00:01:19.359> so<00:01:20.359> it<00:01:20.539> has

00:01:20.589 --> 00:01:20.599 
of it the Elan folios slim so it has

00:01:20.599 --> 00:01:22.089 
of it the Elan folios slim so it has
some<00:01:20.810> decent<00:01:20.929> stitching<00:01:21.469> on<00:01:21.529> it<00:01:21.709> looks<00:01:21.950> like

00:01:22.089 --> 00:01:22.099 
some decent stitching on it looks like

00:01:22.099 --> 00:01:25.059 
some decent stitching on it looks like
they<00:01:22.219> made<00:01:22.490> it<00:01:22.609> quickly<00:01:22.909> obviously<00:01:23.659> so<00:01:24.069> it's

00:01:25.059 --> 00:01:25.069 
they made it quickly obviously so it's

00:01:25.069 --> 00:01:26.589 
they made it quickly obviously so it's
pretty<00:01:25.189> decent<00:01:25.429> hopefully<00:01:25.939> it'll<00:01:26.119> last<00:01:26.389> at

00:01:26.589 --> 00:01:26.599 
pretty decent hopefully it'll last at

00:01:26.599 --> 00:01:28.929 
pretty decent hopefully it'll last at
least<00:01:26.689> six<00:01:27.259> months<00:01:27.439> here<00:01:28.159> is<00:01:28.279> the<00:01:28.459> inside<00:01:28.789> it

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:28.939 
least six months here is the inside it

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:31.719 
least six months here is the inside it
has<00:01:28.969> a<00:01:29.060> nice<00:01:29.240> smooth<00:01:29.899> lining<00:01:30.399> so<00:01:31.399> this<00:01:31.549> should

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:31.729 
has a nice smooth lining so this should

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:34.120 
has a nice smooth lining so this should
protect<00:01:31.999> the<00:01:32.149> back<00:01:32.270> of<00:01:32.419> your<00:01:32.509> iPad<00:01:32.869> and<00:01:33.139> it

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.589 
iPad and take this cover off finally and
this<00:02:22.610> is<00:02:22.760> actually<00:02:22.879> the<00:02:23.120> first<00:02:23.150> time<00:02:23.390> I've

00:02:23.589 --> 00:02:23.599 
this is actually the first time I've

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:28.229 
this is actually the first time I've
held<00:02:23.780> this<00:02:23.930> without<00:02:24.230> the<00:02:26.439> plastic<00:02:27.439> stuff<00:02:27.650> and

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:28.239 
held this without the plastic stuff and

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:30.369 
held this without the plastic stuff and
that's<00:02:29.239> her<00:02:29.420> he<00:02:29.540> getting<00:02:29.840> a<00:02:29.900> lot<00:02:30.019> of<00:02:30.049> finger

00:02:30.369 --> 00:02:30.379 
that's her he getting a lot of finger

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:32.699 
that's her he getting a lot of finger
prints<00:02:30.620> but<00:02:30.799> that's<00:02:31.340> to<00:02:31.790> be<00:02:31.819> expected<00:02:31.909> and<00:02:32.569> the

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:32.709 
prints but that's to be expected and the

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:36.160 
prints but that's to be expected and the
back<00:02:33.709> actually<00:02:34.400> this<00:02:34.700> is<00:02:34.849> a<00:02:34.879> lot<00:02:35.150> this<00:02:35.870> is<00:02:36.019> much

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
back actually this is a lot this is much

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:39.610 
back actually this is a lot this is much
nicer<00:02:36.200> to<00:02:36.590> hold<00:02:36.769> in<00:02:36.890> the<00:02:37.040> original<00:02:37.760> iPad<00:02:38.299> so<00:02:38.690> go

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
nicer to hold in the original iPad so go

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:49.979 
nicer to hold in the original iPad so go
ahead<00:02:39.680> and<00:02:39.859> put<00:02:40.040> this<00:02:40.129> inside<00:02:40.400> of<00:02:40.549> the<00:02:40.609> case

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:49.989 

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:52.210 

seems<00:02:50.989> like<00:02:51.200> you<00:02:51.290> have<00:02:51.409> to<00:02:51.530> lift<00:02:51.709> the<00:02:51.889> right

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
seems like you have to lift the right

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:53.949 
seems like you have to lift the right
edge<00:02:52.430> up<00:02:52.670> a<00:02:52.819> little<00:02:53.030> bit<00:02:53.150> because<00:02:53.420> it<00:02:53.690> doesn't

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:53.959 
edge up a little bit because it doesn't

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:56.580 
edge up a little bit because it doesn't
properly<00:02:54.170> fit<00:02:54.709> in<00:02:54.889> there<00:02:55.159> unless<00:02:55.609> you<00:02:55.670> do<00:02:55.940> so

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
properly fit in there unless you do so

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:02.789 
properly fit in there unless you do so
then<00:02:57.590> we<00:02:57.799> have<00:02:57.950> oops<00:02:58.510> turn<00:02:59.510> my<00:02:59.629> light<00:02:59.810> back<00:03:00.019> on

00:03:02.789 --> 00:03:02.799 

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:07.000 

and<00:03:04.930> we<00:03:05.930> have<00:03:06.019> this<00:03:06.139> little<00:03:06.349> flap<00:03:06.590> here<00:03:06.859> that

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010 
and we have this little flap here that

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:08.949 
and we have this little flap here that
we<00:03:07.099> could<00:03:07.220> fold<00:03:07.400> back<00:03:07.670> under<00:03:08.180> the<00:03:08.209> iPad<00:03:08.720> so

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:08.959 
we could fold back under the iPad so

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:13.000 
we could fold back under the iPad so
that<00:03:09.109> the<00:03:09.799> iPad<00:03:10.129> will<00:03:10.310> actually<00:03:10.639> stay<00:03:12.010> stay

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010 
that the iPad will actually stay stay

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:16.960 
that the iPad will actually stay stay
put<00:03:13.250> I<00:03:13.489> need<00:03:13.639> to<00:03:13.730> get<00:03:13.849> a<00:03:13.879> new<00:03:13.940> lamp<00:03:15.790> okay<00:03:16.790> hope

the<00:03:38.930> first<00:03:39.139> I<00:03:39.290> the<00:03:39.560> original<00:03:39.949> iPad<00:03:40.220> case<00:03:40.430> has

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:40.609 
the first I the original iPad case has

00:03:40.609 --> 00:03:42.009 
the first I the original iPad case has
the<00:03:40.760> same<00:03:40.940> problem<00:03:41.150> and<00:03:41.599> well<00:03:41.810> it's<00:03:41.930> not

00:03:42.009 --> 00:03:42.019 
the same problem and well it's not

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:43.869 
the same problem and well it's not
really<00:03:42.169> problems<00:03:42.650> just<00:03:42.829> one<00:03:43.099> little<00:03:43.250> con<00:03:43.579> but

00:03:43.869 --> 00:03:43.879 
really problems just one little con but

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:45.960 
really problems just one little con but
does<00:03:44.569> it<00:03:44.599> really<00:03:44.720> bother<00:03:44.959> me<00:03:45.109> too<00:03:45.319> much<00:03:45.349> but

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:45.970 
does it really bother me too much but

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:49.809 
does it really bother me too much but
this<00:03:46.970> is<00:03:47.150> so<00:03:48.139> far<00:03:48.379> really<00:03:48.769> nice<00:03:48.919> it<00:03:49.549> doesn't

00:03:49.809 --> 00:03:49.819 
this is so far really nice it doesn't

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:53.199 
this is so far really nice it doesn't
add<00:03:49.879> too<00:03:50.359> much<00:03:50.540> too<00:03:51.049> much<00:03:51.079> bulk<00:03:51.500> to<00:03:51.739> the<00:03:51.849> ipad<00:03:52.849> 2

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:53.209 
add too much too much bulk to the ipad 2

00:03:53.209 --> 00:04:00.530 
add too much too much bulk to the ipad 2
but

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.539 

so<00:04:01.200> let's<00:04:01.349> go<00:04:01.469> ahead<00:04:01.500> and<00:04:01.680> go<00:04:01.799> over<00:04:01.829> the<00:04:02.099> ports

00:04:02.539 --> 00:04:02.549 
so let's go ahead and go over the ports

hundreds<00:05:00.090> of<00:05:00.120> these<00:05:00.270> eventually<00:05:01.199> so<00:05:01.440> probably

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:02.280 
hundreds of these eventually so probably

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:04.219 
hundreds of these eventually so probably
