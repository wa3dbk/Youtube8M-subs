00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:43.180 
questions on my Instagram lately about

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:45.870 
questions on my Instagram lately about
why<00:00:43.480> I<00:00:43.510> have<00:00:43.810> such<00:00:44.020> high<00:00:44.290> HD<00:00:44.980> photos<00:00:45.190> and<00:00:45.610> why<00:00:45.850> I

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:45.880 
why I have such high HD photos and why I

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:49.500 
why I have such high HD photos and why I
don't<00:00:46.300> use<00:00:46.840> that<00:00:46.870> same<00:00:47.260> camera<00:00:47.770> to<00:00:48.270> film<00:00:49.270> now

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:49.510 
don't use that same camera to film now

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:50.880 
don't use that same camera to film now
the<00:00:49.570> reason<00:00:49.750> why<00:00:49.930> I<00:00:49.960> don't<00:00:50.290> use<00:00:50.470> that<00:00:50.500> same

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:50.890 
the reason why I don't use that same

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:54.090 
the reason why I don't use that same
camera<00:00:51.250> to<00:00:51.399> film<00:00:51.579> is<00:00:51.790> because<00:00:52.750> most<00:00:53.739> the<00:00:53.950> time

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:54.100 
camera to film is because most the time

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:55.530 
camera to film is because most the time
it<00:00:54.280> only<00:00:54.370> lets<00:00:54.670> me<00:00:54.730> film<00:00:54.940> for<00:00:55.149> like<00:00:55.239> three<00:00:55.450> or

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:55.540 
it only lets me film for like three or

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:57.900 
it only lets me film for like three or
four<00:00:55.600> minutes<00:00:55.960> before<00:00:56.230> it<00:00:56.260> says<00:00:56.500> it's<00:00:57.130> busy<00:00:57.610> or

00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:57.910 
four minutes before it says it's busy or

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:00.090 
four minutes before it says it's busy or
the<00:00:58.719> memory<00:00:58.960> cards<00:00:59.260> full<00:00:59.500> when<00:00:59.770> the<00:00:59.800> memory

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:00.100 
the memory cards full when the memory

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.940 
the memory cards full when the memory
card<00:01:00.280> isn't<00:01:00.550> even<00:01:00.790> full<00:01:01.000> or<00:01:01.440> it's<00:01:02.440> really<00:01:02.770> all

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:02.950 
card isn't even full or it's really all

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:04.560 
card isn't even full or it's really all
so<00:01:03.129> bad<00:01:03.340> when<00:01:03.550> you<00:01:03.579> zoom<00:01:03.850> in<00:01:04.059> like<00:01:04.239> it's<00:01:04.390> great

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:04.570

00:01:08.069 --> 00:01:08.079 
decent quality for video but when you

00:01:08.079 --> 00:01:10.109 
decent quality for video but when you
zoom<00:01:08.259> in<00:01:08.439> it<00:01:08.560> can<00:01:08.679> just<00:01:08.799> show<00:01:09.009> you<00:01:09.069> um<00:01:09.490> it<00:01:09.880> gets
