00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.210
 we go with the prefabricated we can for 

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:06.529
 make gas horns or the engine to 

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:08.660
 elements with things suddenly very 

00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:10.670
 accessible for example the tubes of 

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:14.380
 toilet paper can make a horn 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:16.870
 is this way only by cutting it 

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:19.670
 ah 

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:23.140
 his short 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:23.140
 I'm going to use it 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:33.400
 enough to keep it fixed 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.590
 so that it does not go loose 

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:49.160
 if this can not be a picture of me 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:51.730
 natural mail just do in addition 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.730
 incisions 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:56.110
 way to slices a day more or less 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:02.600
 drone photo by silly gate 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:05.940
 he retired 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:09.220
 and kurt we see 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:11.740
 and this will make my notebook 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:14.890
 be curved if I wanted it to be more 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:18.940
 like goat angel that turns then a 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:20.320
 cut a cut amount let's say the 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:21.670
 kind to have four sides or if you have 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.990
 valued simulating you have four 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:26.800
 sides we make a cut in each one the 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:29.080
 sides in one direction 1 2 3 4 and 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:32.410
 we repeat according to the distance the 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:34.510
 frequency and the amount that you 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:36.280
 eliminate will allow you to agree the most or 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:38.650
 less and also depends on the length 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:42.280
 It is much bigger the projects of 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:46.300
 more more forced things more organic already 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:49.300
 is 12 prefabricated also with the 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:51.370
 cardboard that has that is a gray of 60 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:54.610
 according to veronica version 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:56.290
 we can cut the wings that somehow 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:58.390
 way are prefabricated structures that 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:59.650
 allow us to work and design the 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:03.310
 first and the court the second 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:04.540
 simply so that something like 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.020
 here 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:10.320
 the short and ready with this same cardboard 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:13.780
 I can do prefabricated like hands 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:16.740
 they can be flat and if I start to 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:19.870
 manipulate them I can make this little hand 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:22.460
 acquire a certain life 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:26.210
 same as being fined 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:28.430
 it will have some function if the most 

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:30.620
 fat I can already do two and in the center 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:33.320
 fill in each of the debits after 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:35.330
 that the package obviously to do it 

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:40.240
 like more jerky if it can not be very 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:42.740
 sharp and very thin very flattened 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:46.240
 applying it directly with the rest of 

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:47.830
 what I have here are these pieces 

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:50.650
 Y 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:55.180
 that are left over I can apply that these 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:57.580
 directly on the back the 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:03.180
 back bones of my alebrijes only 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:03.180
 it is enough to model them and assemble them
