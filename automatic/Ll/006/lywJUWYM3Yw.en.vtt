00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.780
 for an interview I'm with 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:12.570
 Thomas one of the developers of factor 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.429
 io i had him by e mail 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.680
 few questions he sent me his 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.420
 answer and the world right away 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.670
 However, you will hear it before 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.990
 few words about it 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:24.570
 Firstly, the questions of one 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.359
 girlfriend read from me nice thanks 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.070
 to you just so that you as a listener 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.779
 better shape and differ as could 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.210
 What is a question and what? 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.850
 an answer from thomas was and secondly 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.969
 I have no idea how to Polish 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:41.450
 I'm sorry, so I'm sorry 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:44.910
 if i get your names more rapist though 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:47.670
 that's just the way it always is 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:51.510
 now it starts with the interview a lot 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:54.059
 Hi Thomas, please have fun 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.739
 and the factor team where are you? 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.960
 got to know and so came the idea for 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.250
 factor forth 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:02.219
 one of my friends michael or 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.019
 kowarik symptom has in spring 2012 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:07.460
 quit his job and started one 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:09.630
 factor rio he always wash 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:12.090
 enthusiastic about computer games and had 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.610
 many ideas for factors of which too 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:18.360
 now many have been implemented 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:20.100
 We are both in our late twenties and have a lot 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.020
 share your experiences with program and 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.200
 a flat in prague as well 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.430
 at the same time our office workplace is 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.170
 we spend most of our time with 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.030
 program but we also take over 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:33.720
 other shots like game design 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:36.390
 promotion community in action and 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.950
 managing free coworkers the 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.990
 Graphics are created by albert one 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.790
 grafikers barcelona the michael in one 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.740
 Advertisement in an artist on the spot 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.630
 He even plans to practice with 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.670
 We are good friends 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.740
 become and also schedule it to 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.439
 to visit Mallorca where he is currently 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:55.579
 Cuba has recently moved on 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:58.619
 connected or blue cube in the forum 

00:01:55.579 --> 00:02:00.390
 a former school friend of us he is 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.159
 also programmer the core of 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.189
 So teams consists of three 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:06.390
 program and a graphic artist fell 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:08.840
 The work was also free 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.860
 Employees made like the music 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.350
 concept drawings and the current ones 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.210
 character animations 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:15.980
 From time to time a few help us too 

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:20.660
 our friends or players from the of 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:22.600
 Thanks a lot to you all and to what 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:26.950
 he works on 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:29.170
 We bring about once a month 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:32.390
 a new version with new ones 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:34.640
 play features out or try it 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:37.460
 at least for the moment we are working on the 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:40.460
 version 0.6 finished the end of the week 

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:43.550
 there should be optimization of the 

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:46.610
 play speed the world map and 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:47.680
 a little secret content 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:51.050
 to be available 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:53.230
 more content secret or not what me 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:56.510
 It is always a good thing 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:58.340
 whoever you have the last one 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:01.060
 multiplayer mode shifted backwards 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:03.350
 what were your reasons for that 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:05.330
 We have made a few bills 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:07.190
 how much time would it cost that 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:10.310
 multiplayer and are to one 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:12.140
 result of a minimum of two months 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:15.590
 full time for two people to come 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:16.520
 with one thing we say unclear 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:19.720
 result 

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:22.280
 that's just too much for now 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:24.260
 That's why we decided first 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:26.240
 singleplayer mode to finish and 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:28.340
 to take care of the multiplayer later 

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:29.690
 We stand behind the decision to 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:32.720
 multiplayer to develop, however, 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:34.430
 At the moment there are more important things like 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:38.420
 the fighting system improved 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:39.800
 campaign and generally more content me 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:40.370
 think most players will be there 

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:43.010
 agree 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:45.470
 another topic my current let's 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:47.180
 play is on a card without an opponent i 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:49.520
 retains prefer very calm great 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:51.410
 factories on it will be peaceful 

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:53.770
 Give players a way in the future 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:56.660
 elena de facto to come 

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:58.460
 probably not the artifacts 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:00.920
 should be a reward for players 

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:01.690
 the go out in the wild and enemies 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:03.920
 fight 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:05.300
 However, it is not a broken leg if 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:07.220
 you do not have the artifacts because you 

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:09.020
 I do not want to fight, I am myself too 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:11.000
 a rather peaceful player 

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:13.610
 you get through the artifacts of their 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.130
 technologies that are great if you are 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:17.560
 But she does not have to 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:20.180
 are to play the game 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:21.639
 faster logistics robots more efficient 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:23.770
 weapons, etc 

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:26.379
 in other words, you will play the game 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:28.389
 even without a fight can finish even if 

00:04:26.379 --> 00:04:31.229
 which is currently not possible because one 

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:33.430
 currently her chains defense in front of it 

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:35.139
 We also think about it 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:36.819
 marketplace install the game on the 

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:40.569
 man then exchange resources against 

00:04:36.819 --> 00:04:41.439
 Things you do not own marketplace 

00:04:40.569 --> 00:04:44.229
 has great 

00:04:41.439 --> 00:04:46.180
 now to murder there are already some 

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:48.069
 Matters for Factors How important is you 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:52.449
 the community and an active modding 

00:04:48.069 --> 00:04:54.550
 scene very very important the game well 

00:04:52.449 --> 00:04:55.840
 designed as possible from the start 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:57.639
 motta be friendly 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:59.500
 we try it so easy and 

00:04:57.639 --> 00:05:01.659
 uncomplicated to make modifiable 

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:03.819
 as much as possible to give people more time 

00:05:01.659 --> 00:05:05.400
 for your ideas have and less puzzles 

00:05:03.819 --> 00:05:08.169
 have to install them 

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:10.539
 besides, we are also in constant 

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:12.009
 contact to modern in our forum and 

00:05:10.539 --> 00:05:15.009
 try him with your problems too 

00:05:12.009 --> 00:05:16.710
 help and the script api to her 

00:05:15.009 --> 00:05:19.330
 to adapt needs 

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:21.310
 you already have him greenlight 

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:22.620
 you are planning a side concept area 

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:24.699
 factor her too on another 

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:26.159
 platform like good old games or the 

00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:28.629
 to publish such viewers 

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:31.389
 At the moment, the greenlight page is just 

00:05:28.629 --> 00:05:33.339
 a concept our plan is a right one 

00:05:31.389 --> 00:05:36.159
 greenlight campaign towards the end of summer 

00:05:33.339 --> 00:05:37.930
 Start and aim while of course 

00:05:36.159 --> 00:05:40.330
 green light and factor 

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:42.339
 to publish early access area 

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:45.490
 around days there are clearly other great 

00:05:42.339 --> 00:05:48.000
 play like can against omonia staff 

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:51.520
 architect and body space program 

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:53.319
 as far as I know, good ol games is just 

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:55.120
 for finished players and I do not know 

00:05:53.319 --> 00:05:57.580
 as in the friendly they are what the 

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:59.439
 I have heard that the search 

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:00.849
 user base is not very big 

00:05:59.439 --> 00:06:03.279
 maybe I'm also at 

00:06:00.849 --> 00:06:06.789
 either way is the wrong one 

00:06:03.279 --> 00:06:08.069
 current plan steam alexis and afterwards 

00:06:06.789 --> 00:06:09.729
 we'll see further 

00:06:08.069 --> 00:06:10.750
 one of my questions has to be 

00:06:09.729 --> 00:06:12.849
 be self-evident 

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:15.699
 Do you already know if you have version 1.0 

00:06:12.849 --> 00:06:17.409
 published what awaits us there and 

00:06:15.699 --> 00:06:19.779
 I'm thinking of the game after the 

00:06:17.409 --> 00:06:21.430
 I continue to support the release 

00:06:19.779 --> 00:06:24.069
 for example, donzdorf or minecraft 

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:25.719
 we are made for one 

00:06:24.069 --> 00:06:27.699
 progressive development process for 

00:06:25.719 --> 00:06:29.769
 facto rio decidedly similar to the 

00:06:27.699 --> 00:06:31.629
 games you have called us 

00:06:29.769 --> 00:06:33.520
 provide the game with updates for so long 

00:06:31.629 --> 00:06:35.889
 how it arouses interest and of course 

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:38.410
 the development costs we say 

00:06:35.889 --> 00:06:40.210
 possibly a whole week in the alpha 

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:42.819
 stadium is not a bad thing 

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:45.250
 thing is if you ask me 

00:06:42.819 --> 00:06:47.229
 we do not have any specifics yet 

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:49.569
 system requirements or a date for 

00:06:47.229 --> 00:06:52.389
 version 1.0 at the moment we have one 

00:06:49.569 --> 00:06:54.400
 Plan for the next two months 

00:06:52.389 --> 00:06:55.840
 but we keep coming back to that 

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:58.509
 feedback from the community 

00:06:55.840 --> 00:07:00.970
 but adjust to something more accurate 

00:06:58.509 --> 00:07:03.759
 becoming facto rio becomes the beta status 

00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:06.069
 if it reaches at least that 

00:07:03.759 --> 00:07:08.229
 following gives a better fighting system 

00:07:06.069 --> 00:07:10.659
 a longer campaign new 

00:07:08.229 --> 00:07:13.659
 at least one new energy source 

00:07:10.659 --> 00:07:18.370
 industry new raw materials another 

00:07:13.659 --> 00:07:20.110
 Scenario pack more fine tuning both what 

00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:20.830
 the game system as well as the graphics 

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:24.789
 As for 

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:27.060
 I think about 1.0 we can think 

00:07:24.789 --> 00:07:29.650
 if there is the multiplayer mode 

00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:31.319
 last question are you still something 

00:07:29.650 --> 00:07:34.060
 note 

00:07:31.319 --> 00:07:35.289
 a factor to work with is a great one 

00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:37.479
 experience for us all 

00:07:35.289 --> 00:07:39.909
 Of course there were a few negative ones though 

00:07:37.479 --> 00:07:41.919
 also a lot of positive moments the 

00:07:39.909 --> 00:07:43.330
 indigo campaign in february 

00:07:41.919 --> 00:07:45.789
 had been one of the 

00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:48.159
 most exciting months in our life 

00:07:45.789 --> 00:07:50.050
 We would like to thank everyone 

00:07:48.159 --> 00:07:52.389
 who support us in the project like 

00:07:50.050 --> 00:07:54.250
 our friends of the community in 

00:07:52.389 --> 00:07:56.680
 our forum and on youtube a video 

00:07:54.250 --> 00:07:57.719
 They help us to make the game better known 

00:07:56.680 --> 00:08:00.219
 do 

00:07:57.719 --> 00:08:04.469
 Thank you for taking the time 

00:08:00.219 --> 00:08:04.469
 Thomas thanks for the interview
