more<00:03:00.760> is<00:03:00.849> beating<00:03:01.209> myself<00:03:01.330> up<00:03:01.660> because<00:03:01.810> they

00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:02.019 
more is beating myself up because they

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:03.630 
more is beating myself up because they
don't<00:03:02.170> ever<00:03:02.349> think<00:03:02.500> it's<00:03:02.680> good<00:03:02.830> enough<00:03:02.860> the

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:03.640 
don't ever think it's good enough the

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:06.750 
don't ever think it's good enough the
risk<00:03:03.910> is<00:03:04.150> that<00:03:04.780> all<00:03:05.110> the<00:03:05.230> gamble<00:03:05.680> is<00:03:05.830> that<00:03:06.610> the

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:06.760 
risk is that all the gamble is that the

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:08.309 
risk is that all the gamble is that the
expectation<00:03:07.450> is<00:03:07.510> up<00:03:07.690> here<00:03:07.930> and<00:03:08.110> what<00:03:08.230> we

00:03:08.309 --> 00:03:08.319 
expectation is up here and what we

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:11.040 
expectation is up here and what we
produce<00:03:08.470> is<00:03:08.830> here<00:03:09.069> so<00:03:09.880> coming<00:03:10.300> here<00:03:10.420> and<00:03:10.959> doing

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:11.050 
produce is here so coming here and doing

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:12.960 
produce is here so coming here and doing
this<00:03:11.290> with<00:03:11.860> a<00:03:11.890> new<00:03:12.069> kind<00:03:12.310> of<00:03:12.489> concepts

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970
