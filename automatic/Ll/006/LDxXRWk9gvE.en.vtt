00:00:00.989 --> 00:00:05.480
 gisasola we go to sneakers pom pom slippers with art and it shows that they 

00:00:05.479 --> 00:00:06.680
 I was using 

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:10.389
 so I've been with the kung fu art works 

00:00:11.129 --> 00:00:12.359
 so is 

00:00:12.359 --> 00:00:15.359
 let's know although the restorer 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:21.670
 jorge sa rivals to see what the restorer's task consists of or go through 

00:00:21.669 --> 00:00:23.230
 his third hit for superman 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:25.029
 the infinity entity of works 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:28.070
 of painting paintings of sculptures and various objects 

00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:31.990
 demarcated that they were damaged by the inclement weather 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:34.150
 for abandonment because some 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:40.160
 the time out there pushed him and it broke but that really a very task 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:41.310
 hard 

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:42.760
 why 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:47.370
 because you have to know a lot you have to know the work know what it is 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.420
 as I was a fan as were the materials 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:52.819
 the colors the technique the textures 

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:57.340
 how to replace what is no longer there and somehow recover it without 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:01.100
 nobody realizes the true job of the restorer 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.400
 has another difficulty that is not always the materials and know what is 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:05.320
 working 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:08.340
 tyson the owners of the works 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.830
 that sometimes turn into a real torment of pretensions 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:14.160
 in order here is 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:17.160
 jorge sarr english the restaurant 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:21.290
 Hispanic life 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:29.180
 the world of the bulls like any other world he 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:32.180
 what people who care about what they do live 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:38.460
 interesting and that you can connect all your possibilities of defenses thing 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:44.480
 after embellishing many years 

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:48.840
 of restoration are going together so some strange things do not 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.030
 World Cup 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.530
 he brings me a picture he restored and then when he sees it 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.350
 already used to my work I feel very good work says but 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:02.909
 and there yes this is the same 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:08.729
 to a painting of and so and so the tunas studies and the signature of so-and-so 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.269
 cuates t4 valdivia but 

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:13.009
 twenty times more 

00:02:13.009 --> 00:02:14.849
 it could be a signature 

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:18.730
 the profession I did not think they could only say but that I think if you 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:19.709
 make 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:21.409
 one can not all 

00:02:21.409 --> 00:02:25.339
 I do not have anything against the stubborn dark-haired counterfeiters but it's not quantified 

00:02:25.339 --> 00:02:26.619
 ornament 

00:02:26.619 --> 00:02:28.939
 like all three years later 

00:02:28.939 --> 00:02:31.939
 I see in one at an important art fair 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:34.149
 the 4s 

00:02:34.149 --> 00:02:37.089
 and there was the painting with a bronze insert 

00:02:37.089 --> 00:02:39.929
 that said the name that I had suggested 

00:02:39.929 --> 00:02:42.929
 and signed or not 

00:02:44.109 --> 00:02:46.469
 the people who are in the art 

00:02:46.469 --> 00:02:50.379
 has accidents and and they have to send the actor to a box for example the 

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:55.279
 gallerists do not come desperate wish please says arregui advance box 

00:02:55.279 --> 00:02:57.959
 but you do not have to notice anything else nothing 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:02.249
 nobody knows what happened the event now very expensive too 

00:03:02.249 --> 00:03:05.709
 restoration work in this case yes 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:08.709
 the breasts can talk about that was restored 

00:03:11.059 --> 00:03:12.929
 It is convenient to know 

00:03:12.929 --> 00:03:16.019
 drawing painting engraving 

00:03:17.109 --> 00:03:18.979
 i zeta 

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:21.239
 imitates 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:24.089
 I studied lethal fish they also go 

00:03:24.089 --> 00:03:27.089
 that is to say and that has artistic sensitivity 

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:31.290
 sometimes when 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:34.380
 one begins to prepare a painting that first is a cleaning 

00:03:35.369 --> 00:03:40.380
 and it's superficial and then yes citi clean the janda 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:43.380
 the earth because I can have the sea with the 

00:03:44.399 --> 00:03:48.399
 pictorial layer and the back of the body then of the back 

00:03:48.399 --> 00:03:50.629
 of the box things appear 

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:54.909
 pieces of paper with telephone numbers with the names of a person with a 

00:03:54.909 --> 00:03:58.340
 address we have ever noticed a ticket 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:01.890
 of course the value has been lost not because I fulfilled seven old 

00:04:04.899 --> 00:04:09.409
 in restoration we replenish materials equal to the original work 

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:12.599
 we use different materials but he 

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:14.609
 visually smile 

00:04:14.609 --> 00:04:19.840
 to avoid vicky one continue with the same materials and that gets confused 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:21.889
 after 

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:24.439
 when an observation is made 

00:04:24.439 --> 00:04:27.139
 with few lights o'connor jun 

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:29.020
 a detection method 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:31.539
 immediately what comes 

00:04:31.539 --> 00:04:34.539
 it is not from the author because the material is different 

00:04:41.779 --> 00:04:42.569
