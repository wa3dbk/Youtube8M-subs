00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
the machine on we're in 3 frequency you

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.740 
the machine on we're in 3 frequency you
can<00:00:54.000> see<00:00:54.239> it's<00:00:54.449> hitting<00:00:54.719> in<00:00:54.930> great<00:00:55.230> frequency

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:56.750 
can see it's hitting in great frequency

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:01.729 
can see it's hitting in great frequency
let's<00:00:57.750> see<00:00:57.899> what<00:00:58.050> we<00:00:58.170> got<00:00:58.379> here<00:01:00.079> this<00:01:01.079> is<00:01:01.289> a<00:01:01.320> 7

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:19.630 
of sensitivity we're on our x9 let's

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:25.770 
of sensitivity we're on our x9 let's
turn<00:01:19.810> this<00:01:19.930> thing<00:01:19.990> down<00:01:20.760> let's<00:01:21.760> go<00:01:21.970> to<00:01:22.030> six

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:25.780 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:29.440

have<00:03:18.070> done<00:03:18.250> when<00:03:18.430> we<00:03:18.520> first<00:03:18.760> come<00:03:18.970> out<00:03:19.030> ground

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:19.600 
have done when we first come out ground

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:24.830 
have done when we first come out ground
balance<00:03:20.020> now<00:03:20.740> let's<00:03:21.700> get<00:03:21.880> her<00:03:21.970> sensitivity

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:35.250 

I'm<00:03:25.840> gonna<00:03:26.050> turn<00:03:26.200> the<00:03:26.350> boost<00:03:26.590> back<00:03:26.860> on<00:03:34.230> you<00:03:35.230> can

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.260 
I'm gonna turn the boost back on you can

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:44.130 
I'm gonna turn the boost back on you can
see<00:03:35.620> you're<00:03:35.920> its<00:03:36.070> gains<00:03:36.400> at<00:03:36.610> nine<00:03:42.900> that's<00:03:43.900> what

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:44.140 
see you're its gains at nine that's what

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:46.380 
see you're its gains at nine that's what
three<00:03:44.410> frequencies<00:03:45.070> now<00:03:45.250> I'm<00:03:45.310> alternate<00:03:46.030> arts

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:46.390 
three frequencies now I'm alternate arts

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:56.430 
three frequencies now I'm alternate arts
came<00:03:46.660> down<00:03:46.930> to<00:03:54.510> see<00:03:55.510> that's<00:03:55.720> what<00:03:55.930> blue<00:03:56.110> stone

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:56.440 
came down to see that's what blue stone

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:58.800 
came down to see that's what blue stone
and<00:03:56.830> alright<00:03:57.160> skating<00:03:57.550> at<00:03:57.640> five<00:03:57.880> now<00:03:58.540> what

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:58.810 
and alright skating at five now what

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:00.840 
and alright skating at five now what
we're<00:03:58.960> going<00:03:59.110> to<00:03:59.170> do<00:03:59.380> I'm<00:04:00.220> gonna<00:04:00.430> turn<00:04:00.580> boost

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:00.850 
we're going to do I'm gonna turn boost

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:03.720 
we're going to do I'm gonna turn boost
off<00:04:01.350> and<00:04:02.350> I'm<00:04:02.590> gonna<00:04:02.740> change<00:04:02.950> the<00:04:03.160> frequency

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:03.730 
off and I'm gonna change the frequency

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:07.410 
off and I'm gonna change the frequency
to<00:04:05.310> two-and-a-half<00:04:06.310> and<00:04:07.000> I<00:04:07.060> tell<00:04:07.240> you<00:04:07.300> what

to two-and-a-half and I tell you what
let's<00:04:07.600> go<00:04:07.720> with<00:04:07.750> the<00:04:07.960> seven<00:04:08.260> and<00:04:08.380> a<00:04:08.410> half<00:04:08.440> to

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:08.680 
let's go with the seven and a half to

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:21.320 
let's go with the seven and a half to
start<00:04:08.950> with<00:04:09.130> okay<00:04:10.090> there<00:04:10.420> seven<00:04:10.870> and<00:04:11.020> a<00:04:11.050> half

that<00:04:22.330> is<00:04:22.570> the<00:04:22.750> seven<00:04:23.140> and<00:04:23.290> a<00:04:23.350> half<00:04:23.380> it's<00:04:23.800> Shona

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:24.160 
that is the seven and a half it's Shona

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:31.830 
that is the seven and a half it's Shona
eight-inch<00:04:24.670> damn<00:04:25.000> it<00:04:25.270> 74<00:04:29.700> okay<00:04:30.700> now<00:04:31.510> let's<00:04:31.720> try

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:31.840 
eight-inch damn it 74 okay now let's try

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:34.950 
eight-inch damn it 74 okay now let's try
to<00:04:31.960> the<00:04:32.170> two<00:04:32.290> and<00:04:32.440> a<00:04:32.470> half<00:04:32.650> frequency<00:04:33.960> here's

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:34.960 
to the two and a half frequency here's

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:36.510 
to the two and a half frequency here's
two<00:04:35.140> and<00:04:35.170> a<00:04:35.290> half<00:04:35.470> frequency<00:04:36.100> that<00:04:36.280> was<00:04:36.400> the

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:36.520 
two and a half frequency that was the

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:47.640 
two and a half frequency that was the
seven<00:04:36.820> and<00:04:36.940> a<00:04:36.970> half<00:04:37.000> or<00:04:37.690> it's<00:04:37.900> Game<00:04:38.140> five<00:04:46.650> okay

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:47.650 
seven and a half or it's Game five okay

seven and a half or it's Game five okay
you<00:04:48.190> can<00:04:48.400> see<00:04:48.550> it's<00:04:48.730> trying<00:04:48.910> to<00:04:49.060> heat<00:04:49.210> its<00:04:49.360> tone

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:50.040 
you can see it's trying to heat its tone

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:54.030 
you can see it's trying to heat its tone
seventy<00:04:51.040> six<00:04:51.310> seven<00:04:51.880> inches<00:04:52.500> that's<00:04:53.500> close<00:04:53.800> by

let's see what I'm gonna do now is go
back<00:04:56.740> to<00:04:56.890> sensitivity<00:04:57.700> and<00:04:58.120> I'm<00:04:58.900> gonna<00:04:59.050> turn

00:04:59.760 --> 00:04:59.770 
back to sensitivity and I'm gonna turn

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:00.570 
back to sensitivity and I'm gonna turn
on<00:04:59.919> more<00:05:00.130> boost

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:00.580 
on more boost

that's the two-and-a-half frequency rx
gain<00:05:18.680> at<00:05:18.949> five<00:05:19.720> then<00:05:20.720> let's<00:05:20.930> try<00:05:21.380> changing

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:21.740 
gain at five then let's try changing

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:23.920 
gain at five then let's try changing
their<00:05:22.250> ground<00:05:22.460> filters<00:05:22.880> they<00:05:23.630> know<00:05:23.780> we're

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:23.930 
their ground filters they know we're

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:25.839 
their ground filters they know we're
still<00:05:24.110> in<00:05:24.169> that<00:05:24.410> five<00:05:24.620> pass<00:05:25.130> let's<00:05:25.460> go<00:05:25.610> to<00:05:25.669> the

00:05:25.839 --> 00:05:25.849 
still in that five pass let's go to the

00:05:25.849 --> 00:05:35.920 
still in that five pass let's go to the
