00:00:05.899 --> 00:00:10.170
 and let's get into the information 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.389
 most important of the consoles of 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.759
 next generation in those debates that 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.289
 are formed here that so interesting we 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.900
 usually seem and is that this time 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:21.779
 two dais developers believe that the 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.820
 xbox one delay makes things easier to 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.070
 playstation 4 again come back to 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.320
 face the two great titans of 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.439
 the next generation to playstation 4 and 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.930
 xbox one ojito because you already know that xbox 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.809
 one is going to be delayed until the next 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.040
 year 2014 in many countries not in all and 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.140
 especially not in the most important 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.059
 this must be clear, but the 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.250
 case is that two of the developers 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.829
 of battlefield 4 have shown their 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.500
 disappointment with the delay of xbox one in 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.420
 your own good country you already know that you give 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.420
 is settled in the country 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.980
 Sweden further claim that this only 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.500
 he will make things easier 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.090
 playstation 4 and is that the truth is that 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.469
 they are and I had the easy way 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.690
 so far but with this still 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:06.430
 it makes it easier, at least according to 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.680
 they and at least in those countries 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:11.740
 alan care designer of the gameplay 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:13.930
 comment the following attentive says me 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:16.030
 it seems that microsoft is trying 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:18.100
 make it easier to choose 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:20.590
 playstation 4 for the new generation 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:23.170
 in Sweden, well, your other partner 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:25.510
 de dais Mr. gustavo mailing has 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:28.150
 said I'm not sure what it is 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:29.950
 thinking xbox not to launch the console 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:32.140
 in a growing country like it is 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:35.560
 Sweden we always buy what 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:37.060
 last and that will be playstation 4 from 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.100
 then it is a more than important subject to 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:40.330
 try and is that even though it has already 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.580
 confirmed that the most countries 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:44.800
 important yes that will be xbox one 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:47.979
 from the first moment from this end 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:50.710
 of 2013 is true that in others 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:52.720
 countries will not be like that in Spain and in 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:54.490
 mexico for example we are lucky to 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:56.440
 that it is going to be like that but there are others 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:58.690
 that they are not going to enjoy that one 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:00.160
 real grief and the truth is that I 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:02.170
 from here I ask you all you think 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:04.330
 that will really affect sales 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:07.030
 you see that this gives advantage to 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:09.640
 playstation 4 I honestly think that 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:12.540
 yes and more with the Christmas campaign of 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:12.540
 by means and everything 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:24.090
 people
