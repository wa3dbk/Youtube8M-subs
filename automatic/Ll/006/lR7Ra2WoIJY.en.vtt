 Angelique Kerber is 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.930
 He is considered as possible that the performative will be only and anyway 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:49.000
 Risks are the result of being the postulate of global light in everyone 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.110
 Speech ahead are Raúl charges 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.380

 Anyway, what do you mean to do that the last days are gone 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.120
 What can be said is that he does not basically have more presents with him 

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:23.350
 these are not typically small-scale value propositions 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:26.250
 some argue that they are only abstract compensation 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.560
