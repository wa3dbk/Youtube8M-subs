okay let's talk about leading our
teammates<00:00:05.339> in<00:00:05.609> passing<00:00:06.569> and<00:00:06.980> when<00:00:07.980> we<00:00:08.099> say

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130 
teammates in passing and when we say

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.499 
teammates in passing and when we say
leading<00:00:09.349> we're<00:00:10.349> leading<00:00:11.219> by<00:00:11.550> throwing<00:00:12.240> the

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
leading we're leading by throwing the

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.670 
leading we're leading by throwing the
ball<00:00:12.690> into<00:00:13.049> an<00:00:13.769> area<00:00:14.330> not<00:00:15.330> necessarily<00:00:16.109> a<00:00:16.260> spot

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
ball into an area not necessarily a spot

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.570 
ball into an area not necessarily a spot
on<00:00:16.859> our<00:00:16.949> teammate<00:00:18.410> but<00:00:19.410> an<00:00:19.560> area<00:00:20.130> a<00:00:20.189> general

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.810 
on our teammate but an area a general
area<00:00:20.970> somewhere<00:00:21.750> in<00:00:22.020> front<00:00:22.470> of<00:00:22.650> them<00:00:22.859> so<00:00:23.550> we're

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
area somewhere in front of them so we're

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.849 
area somewhere in front of them so we're
leading<00:00:24.119> when<00:00:24.810> I<00:00:24.900> say<00:00:25.109> leading<00:00:25.500> we're

spot that we want to do is is right
anywhere<00:00:44.430> in<00:00:44.700> between<00:00:44.820> the<00:00:45.180> numbers<00:00:45.510> all<00:00:45.690> I

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
anywhere in between the numbers all I

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.440 
anywhere in between the numbers all I
shoot<00:00:45.989> for<00:00:46.230> the<00:00:46.320> numbers<00:00:46.820> if<00:00:47.820> it's<00:00:48.030> too<00:00:48.239> low

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
shoot for the numbers if it's too low

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:49.580 
shoot for the numbers if it's too low
and<00:00:48.480> they're<00:00:48.989> cutting<00:00:49.289> to<00:00:49.440> the<00:00:49.469> basket

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
and they're cutting to the basket

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.439 
and they're cutting to the basket
they've<00:00:50.070> got<00:00:50.250> to<00:00:50.340> reach<00:00:50.520> down<00:00:50.820> and<00:00:50.850> then<00:00:51.210> bring

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
they've got to reach down and then bring

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:52.670 
they've got to reach down and then bring
it<00:00:51.539> all<00:00:51.660> of<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:51.930> way<00:00:51.960> up<00:00:52.110> and<00:00:52.410> all<00:00:52.500> of<00:00:52.649> that

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
it all of the way up and all of that

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.979 
it all of the way up and all of that
takes<00:00:53.070> time<00:00:53.340> and<00:00:53.670> so<00:00:54.180> we<00:00:54.329> want<00:00:54.539> to<00:00:54.629> lead<00:00:54.809> them

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
takes time and so we want to lead them

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.080 
takes time and so we want to lead them
in<00:00:55.199> the<00:00:55.230> best<00:00:55.559> way<00:00:55.739> to<00:00:55.800> get<00:00:56.039> good<00:00:56.250> at<00:00:56.309> learning

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
in the best way to get good at learning

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.950 
in the best way to get good at learning
how<00:00:57.480> to<00:00:57.539> pass<00:00:57.930> and<00:00:58.410> leading<00:00:59.539> your<00:01:00.539> your

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
how to pass and leading your your

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.310 
how to pass and leading your your
teammates<00:01:01.500> is<00:01:01.710> practice<00:01:02.570> it<00:01:03.570> takes<00:01:04.019> a<00:01:04.110> lot<00:01:04.290> of

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
teammates is practice it takes a lot of

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.679 
teammates is practice it takes a lot of
practice<00:01:04.860> it<00:01:05.040> takes<00:01:05.250> timing<00:01:06.680> efficiency<00:01:07.680> and

00:01:08.679 --> 00:01:08.689 
practice it takes timing efficiency and

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:11.480 
practice it takes timing efficiency and
lots<00:01:09.689> of<00:01:09.840> practice<00:01:10.290> and<00:01:10.470> it<00:01:10.860> depends<00:01:11.220> on<00:01:11.340> how

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
lots of practice and it depends on how

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.460 
lots of practice and it depends on how
fast<00:01:11.850> they're<00:01:12.270> comin<00:01:12.600> down<00:01:12.689> the<00:01:12.900> court<00:01:12.930> at

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
fast they're comin down the court at

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.550 
fast they're comin down the court at
what<00:01:13.770> angle<00:01:14.450> and<00:01:15.450> like<00:01:15.659> I<00:01:15.810> say<00:01:16.020> lots<00:01:16.380> of

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
what angle and like I say lots of

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.499 
what angle and like I say lots of
practice<00:01:16.979> but<00:01:17.159> you<00:01:17.310> want<00:01:17.520> to<00:01:17.640> lead<00:01:18.119> them<00:01:18.330> with

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
practice but you want to lead them with

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.300 
practice but you want to lead them with
that<00:01:18.540> ball<00:01:18.869> in<00:01:19.020> front<00:01:19.259> of<00:01:19.380> them<00:01:19.500> somewhere<00:01:19.890> in

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
that ball in front of them somewhere in

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.940 
that ball in front of them somewhere in
an<00:01:20.729> area<00:01:21.000> that's<00:01:21.360> you<00:01:21.600> know<00:01:21.720> hitting<00:01:22.710> them

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
an area that's you know hitting them

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.830 
an area that's you know hitting them
right<00:01:23.130> here<00:01:23.159> we're<00:01:24.119> hitting<00:01:24.479> them<00:01:24.600> right<00:01:24.810> here

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
right here we're hitting them right here

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.660 
right here we're hitting them right here
while<00:01:25.380> they're<00:01:25.560> in<00:01:25.590> stride<00:01:26.040> so<00:01:26.310> they<00:01:26.520> can

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
while they're in stride so they can

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.510 
while they're in stride so they can
easily<00:01:27.090> catch<00:01:27.360> that<00:01:27.659> ball<00:01:27.869> and<00:01:28.369> get<00:01:29.369> into

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
easily catch that ball and get into

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.179 
easily catch that ball and get into
their<00:01:29.850> ready<00:01:30.090> position<00:01:30.479> or<00:01:30.900> continue<00:01:31.829> on<00:01:32.009> in

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
their ready position or continue on in

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.969 
their ready position or continue on in
their<00:01:32.310> stride<00:01:32.610> and<00:01:32.850> shoot<00:01:33.420> a<00:01:33.509> layup<00:01:33.750> so<00:01:34.590> very

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
their stride and shoot a layup so very

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.280 
their stride and shoot a layup so very
important<00:01:35.430> leading<00:01:35.820> lots<00:01:36.329> of<00:01:36.540> practice<00:01:36.990> the

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
important leading lots of practice the

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.800 
important leading lots of practice the
balls<00:01:37.530> in<00:01:37.710> front<00:01:38.009> of<00:01:38.100> them<00:01:38.220> and<00:01:38.689> we'll<00:01:39.689> give

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
balls in front of them and we'll give

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.840 
balls in front of them and we'll give
you<00:01:39.900> a<00:01:39.930> demonstration<00:01:40.159> okay<00:01:41.159> so<00:01:41.220> we've<00:01:41.610> got

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
you a demonstration okay so we've got

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.940 
you a demonstration okay so we've got
Scott<00:01:42.509> he's<00:01:42.780> going<00:01:42.990> to<00:01:43.049> be<00:01:43.170> demonstrating<00:01:43.350> how

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
Scott he's going to be demonstrating how

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.679 
Scott he's going to be demonstrating how
he's<00:01:44.159> just<00:01:44.820> running<00:01:45.030> down<00:01:45.210> the<00:01:45.360> side<00:01:45.570> and

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
he's just running down the side and

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:46.910 
he's just running down the side and
we're<00:01:45.810> going<00:01:45.960> to<00:01:45.990> throw<00:01:46.259> it<00:01:46.380> we're<00:01:46.740> going<00:01:46.860> to

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
we're going to throw it we're going to

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.350 
we're going to throw it we're going to
use<00:01:47.040> a<00:01:47.070> bounce<00:01:47.340> pass<00:01:47.490> in<00:01:47.880> front<00:01:47.909> of<00:01:48.180> him<00:01:48.299> a

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
use a bounce pass in front of him a

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.850 
use a bounce pass in front of him a
little<00:01:48.450> bit<00:01:48.659> hopefully<00:01:49.079> its<00:01:49.200> imposition

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
little bit hopefully its imposition

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.350 
little bit hopefully its imposition
enough<00:01:50.310> where<00:01:50.460> he<00:01:50.520> can<00:01:50.670> just<00:01:50.820> continue<00:01:51.119> his

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
enough where he can just continue his

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.560 
enough where he can just continue his
stride<00:01:51.659> and<00:01:52.079> continue<00:01:53.070> with<00:01:53.189> making<00:01:53.939> a<00:01:54.030> lab<00:01:54.210> so
