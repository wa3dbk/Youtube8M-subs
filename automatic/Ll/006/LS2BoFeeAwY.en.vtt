00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:23.210
 personal paulo 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:26.420
 imagine google sharing the data 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:31.400
 from your HD on the internet to everyone 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:35.090
 to be able to see even this is not happening anymore 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:38.720
 I'll explain better what happens today. 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:42.770
 In the day we have several routers with 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:46.280
 USB ports and it is common to pick up an HD 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:49.330
 and connect a router to you 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:53.270
 access the files inside that hd 

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:54.880
 via the right network you put hd then you 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:57.140
 access from a notebook computer 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:59.810
 smartphone out there 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:04.009
 I do not particularly like it very much 

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:07.610
 because my router the usb port is 2.0 

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:10.880
 so it's a little slow this use 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:14.540
 but it is a very interesting resource and 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:18.230
 very practical to use a problem is 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:20.900
 that google is the default is not well 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:25.030
 google the default sound of companies that 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:28.370
 make hd and leave the option of ftp 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:30.740
 then activated there very well a 

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:33.620
 security on top of that I'll leave a 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:37.100
 link in the video description for our 

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:41.450
 The website well the portal x.com are you check 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:43.580
 if you are experiencing this problem 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:46.760
 You can see if this is 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:48.680
 happening with your right external hd 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:51.229
 will have a tutorial explaining everything 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:54.320
 right there on our site 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:57.409
 but care has to be taken 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:02:00.470
 after all, companies already have 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:03.950
 more information about us nÃ© 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:04.580
 how google facebook microsoft out there 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:07.280
 go 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:09.470
 these companies have access to much 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:12.110
 information from our personal life things 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:14.629
 we now know that not imagine having 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:17.390
 access to documents I have many people 

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:19.939
 have a document with passwords in the 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:23.690
 note it all the passwords in that 

00:02:19.939 --> 00:02:26.480
 document is personal photos and so on. 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:27.650
 so be careful people stay 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:31.189
 careful with this 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:34.459
 who has a hd on the router 

00:02:31.189 --> 00:02:36.319
 stay smart and do the test check 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:39.019
 everything is ok beauty 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:42.319
 a big hug and until the next 

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:47.290
 video that the water persists wind that 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:47.290
 I had a topstick there and so did krall.
