 Knock me it 'I have the I have 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.440
 People told us we had a great many 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.720

 we have a progressive system 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:46.680
 you can level me now 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.640
 during the pvp game and we have 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.140
 ranking list 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.059
 In addition, we still have that 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.710
 Midsummer night event there you can 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.640
 namely cool items for old event 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.559
 buy resources 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.960
 that was great but I want more 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:04.080
 details whom can i ask then asks 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:06.330
 the best times paula paula a little bird 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.490
 twittered you experts on 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.110
 the area of ​​the progress system yes 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.119
 and that's true we even have now 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.360
 a new pvp submission system 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:17.729
 because the player can pvp extreme together 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.610
 So experience points and live with it 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:23.430
 up to level 30 and each level 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.780
 great reward for the player but 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.880
 that not all we have one too 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.560
 building what the current level shows 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.060
 But you can better the building 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.619
 at the graphic artists 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.619
 also for the graphic 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.640
 hello I heard you 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:48.250
 skillful magic with a studio 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:50.740
 divorced marriage have magical videos 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:53.530
 we built such a water castle that is 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:55.630
 for pvp to display the progression 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:57.970
 the player will then be on the water 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:01.330
 can build on a solid building site 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:03.040
 and that was our very first idea for it 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:06.130
 However, we have noticed that 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:07.390
 It's such a long time a bit 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.600
 there is little and that was just one 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:12.480
 could do a little more so came along 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:15.239
 in 3d but of kit 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:17.380
 put together and have just made it 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:19.480
 many different versions of 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:20.319
 the water castle or how to do it 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.090
 do not start anything 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:25.840
 we see the first versions the 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:27.670
 have already seen and have passed away 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:30.730
 Here are some things to be combined until 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:31.900
 We will be with him afterwards 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:35.470
 landed here 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:37.150
 and there will be in the future too 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:39.130
 a little something to do to 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:42.130
 For example , many hikers see the 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:45.220
 elements that is pure as I said now 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:48.190
 the 3d model we have then the whole 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:50.980
 in 2d again after processed sees 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:52.060
 one as in photoshop if I have one 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.640
 open 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:56.290
 this is the final version like her 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.840
 then you can see in the water then 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:01.060
 I'll show you what was there 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:03.910
 in a nutshell what had changed 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:08.380
 here are different things like that 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:10.299
 Underwater area the reflection to 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:12.190
 Example, the waves again in addition 

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:14.430
 everything from hans on the tray 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:16.989
 means just a little bit more 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:20.340
 detail in the whole to get 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:23.739
 All in all, then when there again 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:25.030
 where we have the finished object that 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:27.400
 is impressive 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:30.519
 it's worth fighting for, yes 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:34.859
 I think so too, then I would 

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:34.859
 say it goes on to web dave 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:46.040
 I've heard that lawyers website 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:47.900
 built 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:49.730
 yes that's right and I want everything about it 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:51.470
 know everything clearly and that too 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:53.870
 ranked website you can see the top 10 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:56.060
 players worldwide or just on the 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:57.620
 11 and can compete with them 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:00.590
 besides, you see your own 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:03.739
 rang and we have the example 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:07.010
 efficiency that efficiency ranking and there 

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:09.079
 Can you see how many troops you have 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:11.329
 have flattened in relation to the 

00:04:09.079 --> 00:04:12.769
 has deployed troops but I have 

00:04:11.329 --> 00:04:16.639
 heard you have to go on because 

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:18.769
 there is another news hall okay 

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:20.090
 There are countless settler fans out there 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:22.160
 and they want to know what's new 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:24.650

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:33.289
 will introduce and that is it 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:35.360
 here at the midsummer night event this 

00:04:33.289 --> 00:04:37.639
 event will allow the player his 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:40.010
 to use old resources and them 

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:42.889
 in tokens to exchange with these 

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:44.720
 turn things in the shop to buy since the 

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:46.400
 Most players use these resources in 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:48.229
 But they did not have their star menu 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:50.090
 knew what to do with it 

00:04:48.229 --> 00:04:52.070
 we now have it for the player 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:54.320
 allows one with these resources 

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:54.770
 to buy new currency we token 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:57.020
 call 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:59.539
 For example, with this tokens you can 

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:01.370

00:04:59.539 --> 00:05:03.139
 or different buildings for the 

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:04.370
 player on the home island useful 

00:05:03.139 --> 00:05:07.070
 could buy 

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:09.229
 it works the following way 

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:11.419
 player comes into the profile store and clicks 

00:05:09.229 --> 00:05:13.760
 then on an exchange now he can his 

00:05:11.419 --> 00:05:15.740
 easter eggs for example easter 

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:18.169

 martial arts every single purchase has 

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:34.160
 a varying value depending on 

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:36.289
 which old we do not want to have a fair 

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:37.940
 that sounds great to me i would 

00:05:36.289 --> 00:05:39.919
 say old stuff that has to be back 

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:42.970
 are worthwhile with the settlers online so much 

00:05:39.919 --> 00:05:42.970
