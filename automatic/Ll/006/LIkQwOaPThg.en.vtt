00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.270
 and then more when chaves here were 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:09.320
 commenting on a gameplay more than the bikes 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:12.750
 with regret on overseas map 

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:14.460
 overflow if the goal was a weapon that in 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.320
 that good to me and has not 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.550
 I have no mettle with this weapon as 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.109
 can you talk with involved in being 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.520
 older than it is a very game 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.730
 very fast 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:26.189
 for more than three minutes on the map 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.990
 good premieres the entity has said it is 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.029
 that lasted very little because it was good 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.309
 playing with friends and between them and another 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:35.520
 one that is called da putera idea or 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:37.950
 something like that was taken out before me 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.450
 dog and him in the cars and the swarm and 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.100
 Of course I think I got them to take it out 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.290
 I do not know if twice I think it was good or 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.539
 once but good the case is that we go 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.390
 we both beat the enemy 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.770
 what portion luckily I do not know did not go and 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.180
 because thanks to that we get 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.219
 finish the game very fast that by 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.960
 true many times this is something that 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.460
 I want to emphasize because I do not know if many 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.800
 Sometimes you have thought someone 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.590
 said but you know that the 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.480
 time of 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:03.070
 of being valued as a player not 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:05.230
 really the most important thing is neither the 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:06.850
 proportion of casualties or casualties that 

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:10.270
 you do not have those things in total because that 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:12.190
 above all, it depends a lot on time 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:13.600
 that you play not then for example the 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:17.320
 you take or the score that you 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:19.510
 you take that really is not an indicator 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:23.200
 key to the good that such a commission 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:25.360
 subtle the best to know if one is 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.860
 good or bad that I always look when 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:29.020
 I'm in a game that many brutes 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:31.090
 you will know and you have not noticed 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.740
 because I tell you I now though quite 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:36.009
 simple fixed here the double plays it 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:37.930
 through the window and what is the score 

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:39.190
 per minute that I wanted to talk a little 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:42.310
 and the contribution per minute since it is 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:43.810
 a with this a quick gameplay in the 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:45.759
 the score per minute without doubt 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:47.110
 this game is very high I do not know how much 

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:49.180
 how much to get but I know you gave me 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:51.039
 many points especially from 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:52.630
 this next moment in which good at 

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:54.580
 final in the last 10 seconds to a 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:56.619
 incredible massacre with the metra with the 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:59.140
 emt cachuli ximo the truth but good 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:00.910
 was score per minute is it 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.470
 depending on the points you have to 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:04.120
 you have obtained in the game you are divided 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:07.840
 for the time it has taken 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:09.100
 to be completed then clear though 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.350
 maybe many of you have in 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:13.270
 low with end it is better not to capture the 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:15.010
 plates so they have more opportunity to 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:16.660
 kill good people that's fine 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:19.030
 but is that the sheets are 100 points 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:21.490
 base maintenance points that are very much 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:24.190
 and fix the guide or the cap one two three 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:27.460
 four and we stole five badges or here 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:30.160
 got more than 500 points high apart 

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:31.810
 of the rest in eight seconds and that's a 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.670
 barbarity is an outrage and here I 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:35.530
 they kill but good a penita so 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:36.790
 well I tell you that if you worry 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.380
 because people see good people 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:41.110
 players who talked about the pain is that 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:42.970
 I care about the truth always be of 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:45.660
 those who score the most per minute 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:49.210
 I usually be the first for the 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:50.350
 90% of the time in the game 

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:52.930
 luckily so I'm pretty 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:54.730
 satisfied for this achievement of mine by my 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:55.990
 score per minute and it's something so 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:57.670
 you have to keep in mind because 

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:58.900
 they are only the casualties they are imported 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:00.640
 the score per minute is very 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:03.010
 important for them to value that you are a 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.750
 good player like around here now when 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:05.680
 I come here when I get many 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:07.209
 low but good 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.799
 I hope you like this information from 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:12.000
 the score per minute something short that 

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:12.000
 I wanted to comment for a long time 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:18.670
 the camera offers four kids me 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.170
 like please 150 would be a pass and 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:23.680
 I hope everything with other countries a good 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:25.000
 day 42 ends the game and nothing does not 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:26.950
 it serves those two kids for nothing 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.639
 take care of them a lot and see you later 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:29.639
 goodbye
