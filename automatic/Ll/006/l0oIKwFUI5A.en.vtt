 where maximum correction is needed 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:23.820

 for the correction area around the eyes I will 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:39.119
 use glasses concealer who has 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.810
 light texture do not accentuate attention 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.280

 by completing an egg scan I'll 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:44.280
 use compact powder which 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:47.840
 fits any skin tone you apply 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.840

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:10.740
 use such pigment selected those 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.610
 wear it without a comfortable tassel pattern 

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:15.120

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:24.300
 saturated brow bushes which now 

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:27.110

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:33.000
 regional state paper slightly 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:35.250
 rather dense expressive layer 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.990
 on the pier take 3 units and get 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:39.290
 very natural transition to global 

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:39.290
 wagon 

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:59.180
 personally 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:08.550
 on all moving eyelids I will put shadows and 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:12.440
 neutral shade another serve us 

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:12.440

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:42.940
 pencil which is fine gone and 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:42.940

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:00.160
 shadows and put over our pencil 

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:03.480

 long and fluffy eyelashes 

00:05:57.639 --> 00:06:01.749
 to make the leg more resistant we will 

00:06:00.219 --> 00:06:02.139
 use a waterproof pencil for 

00:06:01.749 --> 00:06:05.199
