00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
wallpaper and different setup I had

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.029 
wallpaper and different setup I had
that's<00:00:17.550> that's<00:00:18.500> wasn't<00:00:19.500> in<00:00:19.560> the<00:00:19.619> middle<00:00:19.770> just

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
that's that's wasn't in the middle just

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:21.980 
that's that's wasn't in the middle just
making<00:00:20.640> it<00:00:20.730> go<00:00:20.880> in<00:00:20.970> the<00:00:21.029> middle<00:00:21.150> you're<00:00:21.779> able

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
making it go in the middle you're able

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.480 
making it go in the middle you're able
to<00:00:22.020> move<00:00:22.199> all<00:00:22.380> this<00:00:22.529> stuff<00:00:22.769> it's<00:00:23.010> really<00:00:23.070> cool

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:25.490 
to move all this stuff it's really cool

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:27.439 
to move all this stuff it's really cool
it's<00:00:26.490> even<00:00:26.820> cooler<00:00:26.939> on<00:00:27.180> a<00:00:27.240> touchscreen

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
it's even cooler on a touchscreen

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.179 
it's even cooler on a touchscreen
because<00:00:27.840> you<00:00:27.930> could<00:00:28.080> just<00:00:28.230> move<00:00:28.349> it<00:00:28.529> with<00:00:29.039> your

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
because you could just move it with your

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.460 
because you could just move it with your
fingers<00:00:29.519> instead<00:00:29.760> of<00:00:29.939> using<00:00:30.060> the<00:00:30.240> mouse<00:00:30.470> so

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
fingers instead of using the mouse so

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.700 
fingers instead of using the mouse so
it's<00:00:31.679> more<00:00:31.890> realistic<00:00:32.369> to<00:00:32.640> Holograms<00:00:33.710> this

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
it's more realistic to Holograms this

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.530 
it's more realistic to Holograms this
right<00:00:35.040> down<00:00:35.190> here<00:00:35.460> is<00:00:35.550> called<00:00:35.640> rocket<00:00:36.090> dock<00:00:36.239> it
