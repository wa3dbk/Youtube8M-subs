00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:40.220 
and then I figured well you know it
I'll<00:00:39.090> just<00:00:39.120> coup<00:00:39.450> up<00:00:39.570> with<00:00:39.690> a<00:00:39.719> random<00:00:40.079> group

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
I'll just coup up with a random group

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:41.479 
I'll just coup up with a random group
and<00:00:40.469> they<00:00:40.530> probably<00:00:40.710> won't<00:00:40.860> kill<00:00:41.040> the<00:00:41.160> shadows

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
and they probably won't kill the shadows

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.639 
and they probably won't kill the shadows
of<00:00:41.640> anger<00:00:41.969> here<00:00:42.270> those<00:00:42.809> kilowatts<00:00:43.110> awesome

of anger here those kilowatts awesome

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.529 
of anger here those kilowatts awesome
leave<00:00:43.860> well<00:00:44.489> that's<00:00:44.640> exactly<00:00:44.789> what<00:00:45.210> they<00:00:45.329> did

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
and so that really kind of saved me a

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.299 
and so that really kind of saved me a
lot<00:00:48.270> of<00:00:48.420> time<00:00:48.600> and<00:00:49.230> so<00:00:49.469> that's<00:00:49.710> if<00:00:49.920> you<00:00:50.010> want<00:00:50.219> to

do this
I<00:00:50.760> just<00:00:51.210> queue<00:00:51.449> up<00:00:51.600> for<00:00:51.629> the<00:00:51.840> scenario<00:00:52.170> and<00:00:52.680> if

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
I just queue up for the scenario and if

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.279

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.279 
queue up again it'll take like I don't
know<00:00:56.879> I<00:00:57.090> mean<00:00:57.539> for<00:00:57.570> me<00:00:57.750> and<00:00:57.870> only<00:00:57.989> took<00:00:58.109> me<00:00:58.260> one

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
know I mean for me and only took me one

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.110 
know I mean for me and only took me one
try<00:00:58.680> to<00:00:58.739> find<00:00:59.039> a<00:00:59.100> group<00:00:59.280> that<00:00:59.460> wouldn't<00:00:59.760> you

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
try to find a group that wouldn't you

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.569 
try to find a group that wouldn't you
know<00:01:00.210> do<00:01:00.359> anything<00:01:00.690> stupid<00:01:00.899> but<00:01:01.739> I'm<00:01:02.280> sure<00:01:02.489> it

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
know do anything stupid but I'm sure it

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.340 
know do anything stupid but I'm sure it
would<00:01:02.730> take<00:01:02.910> less<00:01:03.120> than<00:01:03.329> like<00:01:03.510> a<00:01:03.570> half<00:01:03.840> hour<00:01:04.049> to

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
would take less than like a half hour to

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.109 
would take less than like a half hour to
do<00:01:04.500> I<00:01:04.769> mean<00:01:05.100> considering<00:01:05.400> each<00:01:05.549> time<00:01:05.880> doing

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
do I mean considering each time doing

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.890 
do I mean considering each time doing
this<00:01:06.420> takes<00:01:06.750> like<00:01:07.710> 5<00:01:08.610> minutes<00:01:09.119> not<00:01:09.420> a<00:01:09.479> big<00:01:09.689> deal

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
this takes like 5 minutes not a big deal

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.840 
this takes like 5 minutes not a big deal
so<00:01:10.530> anyway<00:01:10.830> so<00:01:10.890> what<00:01:11.189> I'm<00:01:11.280> doing<00:01:11.580> is<00:01:11.729> I'm

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
so anyway so what I'm doing is I'm

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.270 
so anyway so what I'm doing is I'm
standing<00:01:12.150> here<00:01:12.210> is<00:01:12.659> shadows<00:01:13.590> of<00:01:13.710> anger<00:01:14.010> now

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
standing here is shadows of anger now

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.190 
standing here is shadows of anger now
I'm<00:01:14.369> standing<00:01:14.580> in<00:01:14.820> between<00:01:14.939> two<00:01:15.330> of<00:01:15.450> them<00:01:15.630> so

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
I'm standing in between two of them so

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.800 
I'm standing in between two of them so
I'm<00:01:16.619> getting<00:01:17.060> proximity<00:01:18.060> aggro<00:01:18.420> from<00:01:18.630> these

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
I'm getting proximity aggro from these

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.570 
I'm getting proximity aggro from these
two<00:01:19.049> and<00:01:19.350> I'm<00:01:19.439> also<00:01:19.590> random<00:01:20.070> firing<00:01:20.250> the<00:01:20.460> one

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
two and I'm also random firing the one

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.370 
two and I'm also random firing the one
over<00:01:20.790> there<00:01:20.939> wouldn't<00:01:21.750> have<00:01:21.840> a<00:01:21.869> pet<00:01:22.170> over

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
over there wouldn't have a pet over

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.740 
over there wouldn't have a pet over
there<00:01:22.560> to<00:01:22.740> where<00:01:22.890> he<00:01:23.040> collects<00:01:23.400> some<00:01:23.700> and<00:01:24.060> this

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
there to where he collects some and this

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.929 
there to where he collects some and this
is<00:01:24.869> basically<00:01:25.140> the<00:01:25.380> optimum<00:01:25.830> way<00:01:25.860> of<00:01:26.369> forming

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
is basically the optimum way of forming

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.719 
is basically the optimum way of forming
I<00:01:27.150> would<00:01:28.110> say<00:01:28.350> I<00:01:28.740> don't<00:01:29.040> really<00:01:29.400> know<00:01:29.520> if<00:01:29.610> this

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
I would say I don't really know if this

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.069 
I would say I don't really know if this
is<00:01:29.880> better<00:01:30.090> than<00:01:30.299> the<00:01:30.450> throw<00:01:30.600> no<00:01:30.659> tie<00:01:30.869> its

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
is better than the throw no tie its

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.710 
is better than the throw no tie its
place<00:01:31.590> but<00:01:32.070> I'm<00:01:32.340> pretty<00:01:32.640> sure<00:01:32.820> it's<00:01:33.030> probably

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
place but I'm pretty sure it's probably

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.149 
place but I'm pretty sure it's probably
the<00:01:33.900> closest<00:01:34.259> thing<00:01:34.409> you<00:01:34.500> can<00:01:34.530> get<00:01:34.770> like<00:01:35.009> that

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
the closest thing you can get like that

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.640 
the closest thing you can get like that
storm<00:01:35.460> stop<00:01:35.700> brewery<00:01:36.060> method<00:01:36.630> is<00:01:36.780> not<00:01:37.409> even

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
storm stop brewery method is not even

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.200 
storm stop brewery method is not even
close<00:01:37.860> to<00:01:37.890> this<00:01:38.220> like<00:01:38.549> I<00:01:38.729> don't<00:01:38.820> even<00:01:39.000> I

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
close to this like I don't even I

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.550 
close to this like I don't even I
haven't<00:01:39.420> even<00:01:39.479> tried<00:01:39.750> it<00:01:40.079> and<00:01:40.470> I

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
haven't even tried it and I

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.170 
haven't even tried it and I
automatically<00:01:41.159> know<00:01:41.460> because<00:01:41.790> I've<00:01:41.909> done<00:01:42.030> the

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
automatically know because I've done the

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.700 
automatically know because I've done the
achievement<00:01:42.689> for<00:01:42.990> the<00:01:43.049> storms<00:01:43.320> of<00:01:43.439> brewery

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
achievement for the storms of brewery

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.069 
achievement for the storms of brewery
with<00:01:44.040> all<00:01:44.159> the<00:01:44.250> little<00:01:44.460> hot<00:01:45.180> wings<00:01:45.450> it's<00:01:45.780> not

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
with all the little hot wings it's not

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.560 
with all the little hot wings it's not
even<00:01:46.380> close<00:01:46.590> this<00:01:47.369> is<00:01:47.610> a<00:01:47.640> million<00:01:48.360> times

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
even close this is a million times

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:49.120 
even close this is a million times
better

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130 
better

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:51.139 
better
basically<00:01:50.130> the<00:01:50.490> only<00:01:50.579> thing<00:01:50.670> that<00:01:50.909> kind<00:01:51.000> of

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
basically the only thing that kind of

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:52.730 
basically the only thing that kind of
sucks<00:01:51.390> is<00:01:51.630> you<00:01:51.930> will<00:01:52.110> take<00:01:52.140> a<00:01:52.320> lot<00:01:52.470> of<00:01:52.500> damage

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
sucks is you will take a lot of damage

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.520 
sucks is you will take a lot of damage
like<00:01:53.189> time<00:01:53.369> over<00:01:53.640> time<00:01:53.820> and<00:01:54.149> because<00:01:55.049> you<00:01:55.170> get

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
like time over time and because you get

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.050 
like time over time and because you get
this<00:01:55.619> buff<00:01:55.860> but<00:01:56.280> it<00:01:56.340> also<00:01:56.460> makes<00:01:56.729> you<00:01:56.820> deal

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
this buff but it also makes you deal

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.870 
this buff but it also makes you deal
with<00:01:57.530> 60%<00:01:58.530> more<00:01:58.979> damage<00:01:59.310> and<00:01:59.579> you're<00:01:59.790> gonna

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
with 60% more damage and you're gonna

with 60% more damage and you're gonna
have<00:02:00.060> it<00:02:00.119> up<00:02:00.270> all<00:02:00.420> the<00:02:00.570> time<00:02:00.780> because<00:02:01.409> you're

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
have it up all the time because you're

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.370

the only things you really need to watch

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:22.440 
the only things you really need to watch
out<00:02:20.829> for<00:02:20.859> here<00:02:21.370> is<00:02:21.549> you<00:02:22.090> want<00:02:22.239> to<00:02:22.269> make<00:02:22.420> sure

out for here is you want to make sure
that<00:02:22.750> you're<00:02:22.870> not<00:02:22.989> killing<00:02:23.200> the<00:02:23.379> shadows<00:02:23.769> of

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
that you're not killing the shadows of

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.860 
that you're not killing the shadows of
anger<00:02:24.280> because<00:02:24.969> if<00:02:25.090> you<00:02:25.150> kill<00:02:25.329> the<00:02:25.420> shadows<00:02:25.750> of

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
anger because if you kill the shadows of

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:29.280 
anger because if you kill the shadows of
anger<00:02:26.200> obviously<00:02:26.799> the<00:02:27.359> spawns<00:02:28.359> of<00:02:28.689> anger<00:02:29.109> will

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
anger obviously the spawns of anger will

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.559 
anger obviously the spawns of anger will
stop<00:02:29.500> spawning<00:02:29.859> and<00:02:30.340> that's<00:02:31.000> kind<00:02:31.299> of<00:02:31.359> going

00:02:31.559 --> 00:02:31.569 
stop spawning and that's kind of going

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:33.000 
stop spawning and that's kind of going
to<00:02:31.689> ruin<00:02:31.870> the<00:02:32.109> whole<00:02:32.230> farming<00:02:32.560> but<00:02:32.650> as<00:02:32.799> you<00:02:32.920> can

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
to ruin the whole farming but as you can

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:35.759 
to ruin the whole farming but as you can
see<00:02:33.220> I've<00:02:33.400> got<00:02:33.609> a<00:02:33.819> nice<00:02:34.540> little<00:02:34.840> circle<00:02:35.230> pile

00:02:35.759 --> 00:02:35.769 
see I've got a nice little circle pile

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:38.429 
see I've got a nice little circle pile
of<00:02:36.129> them<00:02:36.310> there<00:02:36.519> and<00:02:36.790> I<00:02:37.689> don't<00:02:37.780> really<00:02:38.200> know

00:02:38.429 --> 00:02:38.439 
of them there and I don't really know

00:02:38.439 --> 00:02:40.379 
of them there and I don't really know
how<00:02:38.620> many<00:02:38.680> you<00:02:38.920> could<00:02:39.040> get<00:02:39.220> per<00:02:39.370> hour<00:02:39.549> but<00:02:40.299> I

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:40.389 
how many you could get per hour but I

00:02:40.389 --> 00:02:41.759 
how many you could get per hour but I
say<00:02:40.599> you<00:02:40.659> can<00:02:40.810> probably<00:02:40.959> get<00:02:41.200> at<00:02:41.260> least<00:02:41.409> over<00:02:41.739> a

00:02:41.759 --> 00:02:41.769 
say you can probably get at least over a

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:44.929 
say you can probably get at least over a
thousand<00:02:42.280> per<00:02:42.400> hour<00:02:42.579> not<00:02:42.939> even<00:02:43.180> a<00:02:43.239> big<00:02:43.420> deal<00:02:43.739> I

00:02:44.929 --> 00:02:44.939 
thousand per hour not even a big deal I

00:02:44.939 --> 00:02:47.580 
thousand per hour not even a big deal I
would<00:02:45.939> say<00:02:46.120> also<00:02:46.420> like<00:02:46.720> because<00:02:47.200> these<00:02:47.379> things

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
would say also like because these things

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:50.399 
would say also like because these things
respawn<00:02:48.129> infinitely<00:02:48.780> or<00:02:49.780> not<00:02:50.079> infinitely

00:02:50.399 --> 00:02:50.409 
respawn infinitely or not infinitely

00:02:50.409 --> 00:02:53.039 
respawn infinitely or not infinitely
like<00:02:50.769> instantly<00:02:51.730> like<00:02:52.060> as<00:02:52.329> soon<00:02:52.540> as<00:02:52.689> you<00:02:52.840> kill

00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:53.049 
like instantly like as soon as you kill

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:56.069 
like instantly like as soon as you kill
a<00:02:53.079> pack<00:02:53.379> of<00:02:53.590> them<00:02:53.709> another<00:02:54.489> packs<00:02:54.819> ones<00:02:55.150> and<00:02:55.450> so

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:56.079 
a pack of them another packs ones and so

00:02:56.079 --> 00:02:57.960 
a pack of them another packs ones and so
this<00:02:56.439> is<00:02:56.620> just<00:02:56.829> obviously<00:02:57.310> going<00:02:57.519> to<00:02:57.579> be<00:02:57.730> the

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:57.970 
this is just obviously going to be the

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:00.080 
this is just obviously going to be the
best<00:02:58.209> place<00:02:58.450> to<00:02:58.480> farm<00:02:58.959> in<00:02:59.169> the<00:02:59.290> game<00:02:59.439> right<00:02:59.650> now

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
best place to farm in the game right now

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.429 
best place to farm in the game right now
there<00:03:01.090> are<00:03:01.209> some<00:03:01.329> other<00:03:01.450> places<00:03:01.569> that<00:03:01.959> are<00:03:02.109> ok

00:03:02.429 --> 00:03:02.439
