you<00:00:43.170> no<00:00:43.350> longer<00:00:43.559> need<00:00:44.129> to<00:00:44.340> build<00:00:44.610> them<00:00:44.910> as<00:00:45.059> you

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
you no longer need to build them as you

you no longer need to build them as you
guys<00:00:45.329> can<00:00:45.510> see<00:00:45.570> we<00:00:45.960> have<00:00:45.989> all<00:00:46.289> of<00:00:46.320> these<00:00:46.620> custom

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
these devices right here in this line

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.860 
these devices right here in this line
that<00:00:56.250> i'm<00:00:56.430> going<00:00:56.610> to<00:00:56.670> showcase<00:00:57.210> are

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
that i'm going to showcase are

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.470 
that i'm going to showcase are
completely<00:00:58.739> and<00:00:58.859> utterly<00:00:59.129> instance<00:01:00.120> so<00:01:00.329> that

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
completely and utterly instance so that

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.319 
completely and utterly instance so that
means<00:01:00.690> there<00:01:00.840> is<00:01:00.989> no<00:01:01.020> tick<00:01:01.620> delay<00:01:02.129> now<00:01:02.520> if<00:01:03.090> you

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
means there is no tick delay now if you

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.329 
means there is no tick delay now if you
are<00:01:03.480> not<00:01:03.629> that<00:01:03.840> familiar<00:01:03.899> of<00:01:04.530> redstone<00:01:04.890> what

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
are not that familiar of redstone what

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.090 
are not that familiar of redstone what
that<00:01:05.519> means<00:01:05.790> is<00:01:06.060> that<00:01:06.590> there's<00:01:07.590> no<00:01:07.799> delay<00:01:08.070> in

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
that means is that there's no delay in

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.580 
that means is that there's no delay in
the<00:01:08.220> redstone<00:01:08.760> so<00:01:09.210> basically<00:01:09.780> it's<00:01:10.020> instantly

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
the redstone so basically it's instantly

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.810 
the redstone so basically it's instantly
taken<00:01:10.950> so<00:01:11.460> there's<00:01:11.670> no<00:01:12.260> like<00:01:13.490> latency<00:01:14.490> in<00:01:14.700> the

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
taken so there's no like latency in the

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.780 
taken so there's no like latency in the
transmission<00:01:15.150> it's<00:01:15.720> all<00:01:15.960> done<00:01:16.369> completely<00:01:17.369> so

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
transmission it's all done completely so

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.130 
transmission it's all done completely so
you<00:01:17.850> can<00:01:18.180> see<00:01:18.360> here<00:01:18.570> that<00:01:18.600> this<00:01:18.810> is<00:01:18.960> the

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
you can see here that this is the

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.499 
you can see here that this is the
instant<00:01:19.860> repeater<00:01:20.369> and<00:01:20.700> you<00:01:21.090> cannot<00:01:21.450> change

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
instant repeater and you cannot change

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.719 
instant repeater and you cannot change
as<00:01:22.049> delay<00:01:22.409> as<00:01:22.619> you<00:01:22.740> guys<00:01:22.890> can<00:01:23.100> see<00:01:23.159> right<00:01:23.549> there

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
as delay as you guys can see right there

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.330 
as delay as you guys can see right there
and<00:01:24.259> what<00:01:25.259> this<00:01:25.380> does<00:01:25.439> is<00:01:25.830> it<00:01:25.860> obviously

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
and what this does is it obviously

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.870 
and what this does is it obviously
increases<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:27.150> length<00:01:27.360> back<00:01:27.780> so<00:01:28.520> as<00:01:29.520> you<00:01:29.759> guys

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
increases the length back so as you guys

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.910 
increases the length back so as you guys
will<00:01:30.180> know<00:01:30.360> I'm<00:01:31.079> just<00:01:31.259> going<00:01:31.439> to<00:01:31.500> get<00:01:31.680> myself

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
will know I'm just going to get myself

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.270 
will know I'm just going to get myself
some<00:01:32.460> redstone<00:01:33.060> right<00:01:33.570> here<00:01:33.979> we're<00:01:34.979> going<00:01:35.189> to

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
some redstone right here we're going to

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.960 
some redstone right here we're going to
do<00:01:35.369> the<00:01:35.520> normal<00:01:35.640> 15<00:01:36.090> barks<00:01:36.479> so<00:01:36.600> it's<00:01:36.750> 1<00:01:36.990> 2<00:01:37.200> 3<00:01:37.369> 4<00:01:38.369> 5

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
do the normal 15 barks so it's 1 2 3 4 5

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:45.499 
do the normal 15 barks so it's 1 2 3 4 5
6<00:01:39.540> 7<00:01:39.810> 8<00:01:40.470> 9<00:01:40.500> 10<00:01:42.950> 15<00:01:43.950> and<00:01:44.159> if<00:01:45.090> I<00:01:45.240> were<00:01:45.299> to<00:01:45.360> choose

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
6 7 8 9 10 15 and if I were to choose

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:49.100 
6 7 8 9 10 15 and if I were to choose
this<00:01:45.869> this<00:01:46.560> will<00:01:46.939> leave<00:01:47.939> over<00:01:48.270> here<00:01:48.479> you<00:01:48.930> can

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
this this will leave over here you can

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.499 
this this will leave over here you can
see<00:01:49.380> that<00:01:49.409> it<00:01:49.740> only<00:01:49.920> goes<00:01:50.189> up<00:01:50.430> 15<00:01:50.909> blocks<00:01:51.149> as

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
see that it only goes up 15 blocks as

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.330 
see that it only goes up 15 blocks as
you<00:01:51.600> guys<00:01:51.750> can<00:01:51.930> see<00:01:51.990> right<00:01:52.320> there<00:01:52.530> but<00:01:53.159> however

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
you guys can see right there but however

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.030 
you guys can see right there but however
if<00:01:53.729> we<00:01:53.939> have<00:01:54.270> our<00:01:54.509> instant<00:01:55.439> repeater<00:01:55.770> right

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
if we have our instant repeater right

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.219 
if we have our instant repeater right
here<00:01:56.219> you<00:01:56.460> can<00:01:56.670> see<00:01:57.000> that<00:01:57.299> is<00:01:57.780> able<00:01:57.960> to

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
here you can see that is able to

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.800 
here you can see that is able to
transmit<00:01:58.799> the<00:01:59.130> current<00:01:59.520> more<00:01:59.939> but<00:02:00.600> however

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
transmit the current more but however

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.800 
transmit the current more but however
there<00:02:01.229> is<00:02:01.350> no<00:02:01.380> delay<00:02:01.829> in<00:02:02.009> the<00:02:02.130> transmission

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810 
there is no delay in the transmission

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.240 
there is no delay in the transmission
absolutely<00:02:03.810> you<00:02:03.869> know<00:02:04.020> delay<00:02:04.409> whatsoever<00:02:04.649> so

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
absolutely you know delay whatsoever so

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.789 
absolutely you know delay whatsoever so
there<00:02:05.399> are<00:02:05.520> no<00:02:05.700> tick<00:02:06.030> delay<00:02:06.570> so<00:02:06.990> that's<00:02:07.469> a<00:02:07.590> very

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
there are no tick delay so that's a very

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.979 
there are no tick delay so that's a very
useful<00:02:07.950> feature<00:02:08.340> so<00:02:08.819> that<00:02:08.849> you<00:02:09.360> can<00:02:09.569> keep<00:02:09.780> all

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
useful feature so that you can keep all

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.750 
useful feature so that you can keep all
of<00:02:10.080> your<00:02:10.259> redstone<00:02:10.739> us<00:02:11.039> a<00:02:11.160> constant<00:02:11.610> rate<00:02:11.819> so

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
of your redstone us a constant rate so

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.360 
of your redstone us a constant rate so
that<00:02:13.090> is<00:02:13.299> why<00:02:13.540> that<00:02:14.110> has<00:02:14.230> been<00:02:14.439> created<00:02:14.769> i<00:02:15.220> mean

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
that is why that has been created i mean

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:17.640 
that is why that has been created i mean
the<00:02:15.849> the<00:02:15.879> mod<00:02:16.299> Creator<00:02:16.720> created<00:02:17.200> this<00:02:17.439> for

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
the the mod Creator created this for

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:19.259 
the the mod Creator created this for
himself<00:02:17.799> and<00:02:18.370> then<00:02:18.519> decided<00:02:18.970> to<00:02:19.090> make<00:02:19.239> it

00:02:19.259 --> 00:02:19.269 
himself and then decided to make it

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:22.679 
himself and then decided to make it
public<00:02:19.900> and<00:02:20.110> i<00:02:20.470> must<00:02:20.650> say<00:02:20.769> it<00:02:21.040> pretty<00:02:21.280> cool<00:02:21.689> so

00:02:22.679 --> 00:02:22.689 
public and i must say it pretty cool so

00:02:22.689 --> 00:02:25.740 
public and i must say it pretty cool so
now<00:02:22.870> we<00:02:22.930> get<00:02:23.230> to<00:02:23.500> this<00:02:24.280> is<00:02:24.489> the<00:02:24.640> not<00:02:24.970> gate<00:02:25.269> right

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
now we get to this is the not gate right

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.990 
now we get to this is the not gate right
here<00:02:25.810> and<00:02:26.260> this<00:02:26.829> is<00:02:26.890> the<00:02:27.099> first<00:02:27.129> logic<00:02:27.700> gate<00:02:27.849> of

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
here and this is the first logic gate of

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.270 
here and this is the first logic gate of
teas<00:02:28.180> done<00:02:28.209> and<00:02:28.840> this<00:02:29.530> simply<00:02:29.920> inverts<00:02:30.280> the

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
teas done and this simply inverts the

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.059 
teas done and this simply inverts the
output<00:02:30.819> as<00:02:30.970> you<00:02:31.060> guys<00:02:31.209> can<00:02:31.420> see<00:02:31.480> and<00:02:31.870> so<00:02:32.680> when

00:02:33.059 --> 00:02:33.069 
output as you guys can see and so when

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:37.350 
output as you guys can see and so when
this<00:02:33.370> is<00:02:33.959> off<00:02:34.959> this<00:02:35.680> is<00:02:35.829> on<00:02:36.069> and<00:02:36.400> when<00:02:37.000> this<00:02:37.180> is

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 
this is off this is on and when this is

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.930 
this is off this is on and when this is
on<00:02:37.569> this<00:02:37.840> is<00:02:37.900> off<00:02:38.019> so<00:02:38.650> that<00:02:38.680> is<00:02:39.040> the<00:02:39.220> not<00:02:39.670> gate

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
on this is off so that is the not gate

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:42.990 
on this is off so that is the not gate
right<00:02:40.180> there<00:02:40.290> then<00:02:41.290> this<00:02:41.650> is<00:02:41.799> the<00:02:41.829> or<00:02:42.250> gate<00:02:42.700> and

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
right there then this is the or gate and

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.259 
right there then this is the or gate and
the<00:02:43.180> or<00:02:43.359> gate<00:02:43.629> is<00:02:43.959> the<00:02:44.379> or<00:02:44.530> gates<00:02:44.829> output<00:02:45.549> will

00:02:46.259 --> 00:02:46.269 
the or gate is the or gates output will

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:49.890 
the or gate is the or gates output will
be<00:02:46.420> on<00:02:46.690> and<00:02:47.190> basically<00:02:48.190> if<00:02:48.790> one<00:02:49.329> or<00:02:49.359> both<00:02:49.629> of

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
be on and basically if one or both of

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.530 
be on and basically if one or both of
the<00:02:50.049> levers<00:02:50.680> are<00:02:50.799> on<00:02:51.010> so<00:02:51.489> you<00:02:51.609> can<00:02:51.670> see<00:02:52.000> here<00:02:52.269> as

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
the levers are on so you can see here as

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.720 
the levers are on so you can see here as
soon<00:02:52.690> as<00:02:52.810> I<00:02:52.900> turn<00:02:53.109> one<00:02:53.319> of<00:02:53.409> these<00:02:53.560> on<00:02:53.829> you<00:02:54.549> can

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
soon as I turn one of these on you can

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.199 
soon as I turn one of these on you can
see<00:02:54.970> that<00:02:55.090> it<00:02:55.209> outputs<00:02:55.690> some<00:02:56.349> output<00:02:56.799> and<00:02:57.010> if<00:02:57.879> I

00:02:58.199 --> 00:02:58.209 
see that it outputs some output and if I

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:00.210 
see that it outputs some output and if I
turn<00:02:58.450> this<00:02:58.480> one<00:02:58.840> on<00:02:58.900> it<00:02:59.230> also<00:02:59.560> does<00:02:59.769> it<00:02:59.920> but<00:03:00.129> if

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220 
turn this one on it also does it but if

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.879 
turn this one on it also does it but if
I<00:03:00.340> also<00:03:00.549> do<00:03:00.819> both<00:03:01.120> it<00:03:01.959> also<00:03:02.260> does<00:03:02.590> it<00:03:02.739> as<00:03:02.859> well

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:02.889 
I also do both it also does it as well

00:03:02.889 --> 00:03:06.240 
I also do both it also does it as well
so<00:03:03.840> yeah<00:03:04.840> that's<00:03:04.930> pretty<00:03:05.079> cool<00:03:05.440> now<00:03:06.010> we<00:03:06.069> got

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 
so yeah that's pretty cool now we got

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:07.949 
so yeah that's pretty cool now we got
the<00:03:06.370> next<00:03:06.639> one<00:03:06.700> which<00:03:06.940> is<00:03:06.970> the<00:03:07.150> and<00:03:07.359> gate<00:03:07.780> now

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:07.959 
the next one which is the and gate now

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:10.740 
the next one which is the and gate now
the<00:03:08.019> and<00:03:08.319> gate<00:03:08.620> only<00:03:08.829> outputs<00:03:09.549> and<00:03:09.849> on<00:03:10.480> the

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750 
the and gate only outputs and on the

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:14.220 
the and gate only outputs and on the
power<00:03:11.019> if<00:03:11.440> both<00:03:12.430> inputs<00:03:12.639> it<00:03:13.090> on<00:03:13.269> so<00:03:13.720> if<00:03:13.989> we<00:03:14.109> get

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:14.230 
power if both inputs it on so if we get

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:16.110 
power if both inputs it on so if we get
two<00:03:14.470> inputs<00:03:14.889> into<00:03:15.069> the<00:03:15.220> device<00:03:15.489> you<00:03:15.519> can<00:03:15.909> see

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 
two inputs into the device you can see

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.770 
two inputs into the device you can see
that<00:03:16.299> bomb<00:03:16.599> we<00:03:17.530> have<00:03:17.739> our<00:03:17.980> and<00:03:18.250> gate<00:03:18.780> powered

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780 
that bomb we have our and gate powered

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:22.439 
that bomb we have our and gate powered
so<00:03:20.139> that's<00:03:20.440> that<00:03:20.709> one<00:03:20.949> right<00:03:21.160> there<00:03:21.430> we<00:03:22.269> then

00:03:22.439 --> 00:03:22.449 
so that's that one right there we then

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:24.869 
so that's that one right there we then
have<00:03:22.660> the<00:03:22.870> nor<00:03:23.079> gate<00:03:23.109> and<00:03:23.650> the<00:03:24.099> nor<00:03:24.370> gate<00:03:24.400> is

00:03:24.869 --> 00:03:24.879 
have the nor gate and the nor gate is

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:27.890 
have the nor gate and the nor gate is
the<00:03:25.060> negated<00:03:25.540> effect<00:03:26.169> of<00:03:26.410> the<00:03:26.530> or<00:03:26.739> gate<00:03:27.069> and

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
the negated effect of the or gate and

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:33.809 
the negated effect of the or gate and
basically<00:03:29.099> this<00:03:30.099> gate<00:03:30.639> is<00:03:30.940> always<00:03:31.569> on<00:03:32.819> until

00:03:33.809 --> 00:03:33.819 
basically this gate is always on until

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:35.849 
basically this gate is always on until
one<00:03:34.060> of<00:03:34.090> the<00:03:34.269> levers<00:03:34.629> are<00:03:34.750> on<00:03:34.900> so<00:03:35.230> as<00:03:35.379> soon<00:03:35.590> as

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:35.859 
one of the levers are on so as soon as

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:38.159 
one of the levers are on so as soon as
an<00:03:36.010> input<00:03:36.430> goes<00:03:36.730> into<00:03:37.120> the<00:03:37.239> gate<00:03:37.510> this<00:03:37.810> power

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:38.169 
an input goes into the gate this power

00:03:38.169 --> 00:03:40.170 
an input goes into the gate this power
will<00:03:38.410> disappear<00:03:39.010> so<00:03:39.280> you<00:03:39.370> can<00:03:39.549> see<00:03:39.730> as<00:03:39.849> soon<00:03:40.060> as

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.180 
will disappear so you can see as soon as

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:43.349 
will disappear so you can see as soon as
we<00:03:40.299> apply<00:03:40.840> some<00:03:41.709> redstone<00:03:41.980> power<00:03:42.489> into<00:03:43.150> this

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:43.359 
we apply some redstone power into this

00:03:43.359 --> 00:03:44.970 
we apply some redstone power into this
little<00:03:43.569> unit<00:03:44.079> right<00:03:44.260> here<00:03:44.319> you<00:03:44.620> can<00:03:44.769> see<00:03:44.949> the

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:44.980 
little unit right here you can see the

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:47.789 
little unit right here you can see the
power<00:03:45.489> goes<00:03:45.790> away<00:03:45.940> as<00:03:46.419> you<00:03:47.410> guys<00:03:47.530> can<00:03:47.739> see

00:03:47.789 --> 00:03:47.799 
power goes away as you guys can see

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:49.589 
power goes away as you guys can see
right<00:03:48.010> there<00:03:48.220> and<00:03:48.459> then<00:03:48.519> it<00:03:48.669> turns<00:03:48.879> back<00:03:49.090> on<00:03:49.329> as

00:03:49.589 --> 00:03:49.599 
right there and then it turns back on as

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:53.759 
right there and then it turns back on as
soon<00:03:49.629> as<00:03:49.930> we<00:03:50.079> don't<00:03:50.889> give<00:03:51.040> it<00:03:51.220> any<00:03:51.480> input<00:03:52.769> so

00:03:53.759 --> 00:03:53.769 
soon as we don't give it any input so

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:55.770 
soon as we don't give it any input so
that's<00:03:53.949> that<00:03:54.129> one<00:03:54.340> we<00:03:54.879> then<00:03:55.060> have<00:03:55.269> the<00:03:55.419> NAND

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:55.780 
that's that one we then have the NAND

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:57.899 
that's that one we then have the NAND
gate<00:03:56.139> now<00:03:56.379> as<00:03:56.440> you<00:03:56.560> guys<00:03:56.739> might<00:03:57.010> know<00:03:57.220> if<00:03:57.430> the

00:03:57.899 --> 00:03:57.909 
gate now as you guys might know if the

00:03:57.909 --> 00:04:00.319 
gate now as you guys might know if the
inverted<00:03:58.449> effect<00:03:58.750> of<00:03:58.959> the<00:03:59.079> and<00:03:59.230> gate<00:03:59.470> and

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:00.329 
inverted effect of the and gate and

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:04.369 
inverted effect of the and gate and
basically<00:04:01.650> in<00:04:02.650> terms<00:04:03.459> of<00:04:03.669> the<00:04:03.909> actual

00:04:04.369 --> 00:04:04.379 
basically in terms of the actual

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:08.099 
basically in terms of the actual
mechanics<00:04:05.379> of<00:04:05.500> this<00:04:05.799> this<00:04:06.579> gauge<00:04:06.970> is<00:04:07.299> only<00:04:07.659> off

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:08.109 
mechanics of this this gauge is only off

00:04:08.109 --> 00:04:11.729 
mechanics of this this gauge is only off
when<00:04:08.709> both<00:04:09.010> inputs<00:04:09.250> are<00:04:09.729> on<00:04:09.970> so<00:04:10.449> basically<00:04:11.290> as

00:04:11.729 --> 00:04:11.739 
when both inputs are on so basically as

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:14.099 
when both inputs are on so basically as
soon<00:04:12.040> as<00:04:12.190> both<00:04:12.400> levers<00:04:12.699> are<00:04:12.970> down<00:04:13.269> you<00:04:13.629> can<00:04:14.079> see

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:14.109 
soon as both levers are down you can see

00:04:14.109 --> 00:04:16.589 
soon as both levers are down you can see
that<00:04:14.560> the<00:04:14.709> power<00:04:14.949> goes<00:04:15.250> away<00:04:15.400> but<00:04:16.090> if<00:04:16.329> you<00:04:16.419> have

00:04:16.589 --> 00:04:16.599 
that the power goes away but if you have

00:04:16.599 --> 00:04:19.500 
that the power goes away but if you have
one<00:04:16.959> on<00:04:17.229> you<00:04:17.769> can<00:04:17.919> sense<00:04:18.159> it<00:04:18.340> still<00:04:18.609> off<00:04:18.789> this

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:19.510 
one on you can sense it still off this

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:22.200 
one on you can sense it still off this
is<00:04:19.690> quite<00:04:19.900> a<00:04:19.959> good<00:04:20.260> way<00:04:20.500> of<00:04:20.769> basically<00:04:21.609> cutting

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:22.210 
is quite a good way of basically cutting

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:25.320 
is quite a good way of basically cutting
a<00:04:22.450> circuit<00:04:22.930> because<00:04:23.370> basically<00:04:24.370> if<00:04:24.729> you<00:04:24.969> let's

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:25.330 
a circuit because basically if you let's

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:26.260 
a circuit because basically if you let's
say<00:04:25.419> how<00:04:25.659> to

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:26.270 
say how to

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:30.129 
say how to
buttons<00:04:26.810> or<00:04:27.259> to<00:04:27.879> RS<00:04:28.879> nor<00:04:29.120> latch<00:04:29.180> Azon<00:04:29.810> it<00:04:29.960> if

00:04:30.129 --> 00:04:30.139 
buttons or to RS nor latch Azon it if

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:32.800 
buttons or to RS nor latch Azon it if
you<00:04:30.560> guys<00:04:30.770> know<00:04:31.039> what<00:04:31.220> that<00:04:31.400> means<00:04:31.639> then<00:04:32.000> you

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:32.810 
you guys know what that means then you

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:34.270 
you guys know what that means then you
know<00:04:32.960> you<00:04:33.020> could<00:04:33.289> make<00:04:33.470> it<00:04:33.680> so<00:04:33.830> that<00:04:33.919> you<00:04:34.099> can

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:34.280 
know you could make it so that you can

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:36.550 
know you could make it so that you can
cut<00:04:34.580> a<00:04:34.610> circuit<00:04:35.330> and<00:04:35.569> that's<00:04:35.750> all<00:04:35.960> things<00:04:36.259> so

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:36.560 
cut a circuit and that's all things so

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:39.249 
cut a circuit and that's all things so
that's<00:04:36.770> fairly<00:04:37.099> cool<00:04:37.599> then<00:04:38.599> have<00:04:38.810> two<00:04:38.990> ones

00:04:39.249 --> 00:04:39.259 
that's fairly cool then have two ones

00:04:39.259 --> 00:04:41.260 
that's fairly cool then have two ones
left<00:04:39.500> and<00:04:39.740> this<00:04:39.830> is<00:04:40.009> the<00:04:40.159> xor<00:04:40.729> gate<00:04:40.759> which

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:41.270 
left and this is the xor gate which

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:43.529 
left and this is the xor gate which
means<00:04:41.539> it's<00:04:41.780> the<00:04:41.840> exclusive<00:04:42.680> or<00:04:42.860> and

00:04:43.529 --> 00:04:43.539 
means it's the exclusive or and

00:04:43.539 --> 00:04:46.510 
means it's the exclusive or and
basically<00:04:44.539> this<00:04:44.900> output<00:04:45.500> over<00:04:45.740> here<00:04:45.979> is<00:04:46.190> on

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:46.520 
basically this output over here is on

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:48.790 
basically this output over here is on
when<00:04:46.879> the<00:04:47.180> inputs<00:04:47.780> that<00:04:47.870> are<00:04:48.050> going<00:04:48.409> into<00:04:48.680> this

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:48.800 
when the inputs that are going into this

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:50.350 
when the inputs that are going into this
little<00:04:49.099> unit<00:04:49.430> right<00:04:49.610> here<00:04:49.669> are<00:04:50.090> different

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:50.360 
little unit right here are different

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:53.469 
little unit right here are different
from<00:04:50.720> each<00:04:50.870> other<00:04:51.050> so<00:04:51.470> as<00:04:51.680> soon<00:04:52.220> as<00:04:52.370> the<00:04:52.490> inputs

00:04:53.469 --> 00:04:53.479 
from each other so as soon as the inputs

00:04:53.479 --> 00:04:56.320 
from each other so as soon as the inputs
are<00:04:53.629> different<00:04:54.110> you<00:04:54.349> can<00:04:54.500> see<00:04:54.680> this<00:04:54.830> is<00:04:54.979> on<00:04:55.330> but

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:56.330 
are different you can see this is on but

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:00.010 
are different you can see this is on but
as<00:04:56.509> soon<00:04:56.659> as<00:04:56.840> they<00:04:56.990> are<00:04:57.199> the<00:04:57.349> same<00:04:58.180> is<00:04:59.180> off<00:04:59.509> so

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:00.020 
as soon as they are the same is off so

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:02.140 
as soon as they are the same is off so
that's<00:05:00.470> that<00:05:00.650> one<00:05:00.860> we<00:05:01.400> then<00:05:01.550> have<00:05:01.699> the<00:05:01.849> xnor

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:02.150 
that's that one we then have the xnor

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:04.540 
that's that one we then have the xnor
gate<00:05:02.270> which<00:05:03.050> is<00:05:03.229> the<00:05:03.409> which<00:05:03.770> is<00:05:03.979> the<00:05:04.099> opposite

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:04.550 
gate which is the which is the opposite

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:06.640 
gate which is the which is the opposite
of<00:05:04.610> that<00:05:04.759> which<00:05:05.060> means<00:05:05.240> that<00:05:05.389> the<00:05:05.810> output<00:05:06.139> is

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:06.650 
of that which means that the output is

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:10.659 
of that which means that the output is
on<00:05:07.270> when<00:05:08.270> the<00:05:09.110> inputs<00:05:09.830> are<00:05:10.009> equal<00:05:10.490> to<00:05:10.520> each

00:05:10.659 --> 00:05:10.669 
on when the inputs are equal to each

00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:12.370 
on when the inputs are equal to each
other<00:05:10.909> so<00:05:11.300> you<00:05:11.389> can<00:05:11.539> see<00:05:11.750> where<00:05:11.930> they<00:05:12.020> are<00:05:12.050> both

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:12.380 
other so you can see where they are both

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:15.820 
other so you can see where they are both
off<00:05:12.710> so<00:05:13.370> the<00:05:13.639> output<00:05:13.849> is<00:05:14.090> on<00:05:14.380> then<00:05:15.380> as<00:05:15.590> soon<00:05:15.710> as

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:15.830 
off so the output is on then as soon as

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:17.770 
off so the output is on then as soon as
we<00:05:15.919> turn<00:05:16.130> both<00:05:16.400> of<00:05:16.460> them<00:05:16.759> on<00:05:16.909> you<00:05:17.150> can<00:05:17.330> see<00:05:17.599> that

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:17.780 
we turn both of them on you can see that

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:20.020 
we turn both of them on you can see that
the<00:05:17.870> output<00:05:17.900> is<00:05:18.289> on<00:05:18.560> but<00:05:19.400> as<00:05:19.490> soon<00:05:19.610> as<00:05:19.669> they<00:05:19.880> are

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:20.030 
the output is on but as soon as they are

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:22.420 
the output is on but as soon as they are
different<00:05:20.240> the<00:05:20.870> output<00:05:21.229> is<00:05:21.259> off<00:05:21.469> so<00:05:21.830> this<00:05:22.280> is<00:05:22.400> a

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:22.430 
different the output is off so this is a

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:24.430 
different the output is off so this is a
really<00:05:22.699> really<00:05:22.880> good<00:05:23.270> mod<00:05:23.539> because<00:05:23.960> it

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:24.440 
really really good mod because it

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:26.499 
really really good mod because it
actually<00:05:24.620> allows<00:05:24.949> you<00:05:25.370> to<00:05:25.550> play<00:05:25.789> around<00:05:25.940> with

00:05:26.499 --> 00:05:26.509 
actually allows you to play around with

00:05:26.509 --> 00:05:29.379 
actually allows you to play around with
logic<00:05:26.930> gates<00:05:27.169> and<00:05:27.639> allows<00:05:28.639> you<00:05:28.849> to<00:05:29.060> build

00:05:29.379 --> 00:05:29.389 
logic gates and allows you to build

00:05:29.389 --> 00:05:31.029 
logic gates and allows you to build
stuff<00:05:29.780> without<00:05:29.990> having<00:05:30.409> to<00:05:30.500> build<00:05:30.650> the<00:05:30.889> whole

00:05:31.029 --> 00:05:31.039 
stuff without having to build the whole

00:05:31.039 --> 00:05:33.249 
stuff without having to build the whole
thing<00:05:31.400> so<00:05:31.759> i'll<00:05:32.300> just<00:05:32.360> show<00:05:32.750> you<00:05:32.780> guys<00:05:32.990> right

00:05:33.249 --> 00:05:33.259 
thing so i'll just show you guys right

00:05:33.259 --> 00:05:35.439 
thing so i'll just show you guys right
here<00:05:33.289> let's<00:05:34.159> just<00:05:34.460> take<00:05:34.610> one<00:05:34.880> out<00:05:35.030> of<00:05:35.180> the<00:05:35.240> blue

00:05:35.439 --> 00:05:35.449 
here let's just take one out of the blue

00:05:35.449 --> 00:05:38.110 
here let's just take one out of the blue
for<00:05:35.750> a<00:05:35.840> second<00:05:36.340> just<00:05:37.340> get<00:05:37.580> some<00:05:37.849> redstone

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:38.120 
for a second just get some redstone

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:43.360 
for a second just get some redstone
torches<00:05:38.810> and<00:05:40.779> this<00:05:41.779> right<00:05:42.110> here<00:05:42.139> so<00:05:43.039> let's

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:43.370 
torches and this right here so let's

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:45.580 
torches and this right here so let's
take<00:05:43.580> this<00:05:43.729> and<00:05:43.969> gate<00:05:44.210> for<00:05:44.360> example<00:05:44.870> if<00:05:45.409> you

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:45.590 
take this and gate for example if you

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:48.309 
take this and gate for example if you
were<00:05:45.740> not<00:05:45.949> to<00:05:46.159> use<00:05:46.430> this<00:05:46.669> mod<00:05:47.000> you'd<00:05:47.750> have<00:05:48.110> to

00:05:48.309 --> 00:05:48.319
