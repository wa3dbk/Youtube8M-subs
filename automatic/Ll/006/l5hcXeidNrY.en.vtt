00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.609
 no because it's annoying 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:15.760
 I keep my racket 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.810
 said a little there 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:10.130
 and out of five 20% 

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:15.349
 too close to the bar 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:21.269
 I try concept 

00:02:23.969 --> 00:02:26.969
 besides in a ssii 

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:32.729
 what I'm trying to say on this list 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:42.389
 after I quoted 

00:02:42.389 --> 00:02:45.389
 of attack 

00:02:56.729 --> 00:02:59.729
 even if it is enabled 

00:03:02.399 --> 00:03:05.399
 but I also feel 

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:31.979
 I could attack 

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:34.979
 south pacific 

00:03:54.429 --> 00:03:56.679
 he maintains 

00:03:56.679 --> 00:03:59.439
 they are really eroding 

00:03:59.439 --> 00:04:02.439
 enough to attack 

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:06.979
 you have to have better relations world 

00:04:07.839 --> 00:04:10.839
 ebay which is an opportunity to describe the magnitude 

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:13.280
 he hoped 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:16.280
 after a game phase he likes 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:27.110
 the miss kabylie 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:35.969
 here at lesquin 

00:04:35.969 --> 00:04:37.520
 specialty 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:39.509
 jean-louis borloo who bites health 

00:04:39.509 --> 00:04:42.449
 the hyper and that goes a little bit strong and that she is 

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:44.050
 since the report is 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:47.050
 his startup 

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:50.979
 on leaving we will see the cushioned amortized it's great played 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:55.050
 what to do and last step 

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:10.849
 I signed right away wanted to come here 

00:05:10.849 --> 00:05:13.569
 the first set 6-1 

00:05:13.569 --> 00:05:16.569
 waiting for the justice to put a little order 

00:05:19.219 --> 00:05:22.219
 here are some good initiatives 

00:05:24.599 --> 00:05:27.599
 it's a very good second signal line 

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:30.330
 difficult to bounce 

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:33.330
 at the moment of the assault 

00:05:43.569 --> 00:05:45.669
 therefore necessary to be able to 

00:05:45.669 --> 00:05:48.669
 his suicide is to tell the mayor of Cannes to protest 

00:06:00.889 --> 00:06:04.089
 after a good night's rest their appeal 

00:06:04.089 --> 00:06:07.089
 to be able to find his backhand more easily I know that's where he is 

00:06:08.909 --> 00:06:11.909
 so I will play a first time 

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:14.969
 I will replay a second time 

00:06:14.969 --> 00:06:16.180
 we will try a little bit of 

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:18.770
 here are many limited cases for its pivot but not in a good 

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:21.490
 position I can take modern 

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:24.490
 to try to play in class 

00:06:40.059 --> 00:06:44.039
 so there brice ollivier services i'm flutey 11-ugo then go back on 

00:06:44.039 --> 00:06:46.550
 an exchange rising on your but thanks to senegal 

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:49.550
 which allows to move forward 

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:56.300
 so after a fire seeing that these two for one hour 

00:06:57.219 --> 00:07:00.249
 I am blessed my formation as I freaked in this setback 

00:07:00.249 --> 00:07:02.499
 and here and at the last moment actually play 

00:07:02.499 --> 00:07:05.050
 I close a little soul points and 9 October 

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:08.050
 so she's already a little bit on them on the defensive 

00:07:08.619 --> 00:07:10.389
 just as well uphill in forehand 

00:07:10.389 --> 00:07:12.659
 playing against top 

00:07:12.659 --> 00:07:15.659
 here is the last stretch of road on the theme on top 

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:20.319
 find his reverse 

00:07:20.319 --> 00:07:22.419
 that's what interests taking the initiative 

00:07:22.419 --> 00:07:23.899
 the real world the changes 

00:07:23.899 --> 00:07:26.499
 he associates ballack which is very common I am forced to do 

00:07:26.499 --> 00:07:30.279
 the effort of my progress to make a shallow displacement with the euro 

00:07:30.279 --> 00:07:33.210
 before his match in less on the front 

00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:36.210
 jokinen a little bit in europe 

00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:40.029
 so I take the opportunity to shifted to them the forehand 

00:07:40.029 --> 00:07:42.419
 and from there 

00:07:42.419 --> 00:07:45.419
 I take things in my hands 

00:07:46.679 --> 00:07:47.300
 on the next
