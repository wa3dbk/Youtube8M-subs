00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:25.430 
it too much and Plus this has glutamine

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:27.040 
it too much and Plus this has glutamine
inside<00:01:25.880> it<00:01:26.090> so<00:01:26.240> you<00:01:26.390> don't<00:01:26.480> have<00:01:26.570> to<00:01:26.690> add<00:01:26.840> any

anyway<00:01:42.130> and<00:01:45.100> one<00:01:46.100> full<00:01:46.370> banana<00:01:48.940> break<00:01:49.940> it<00:01:50.060> up

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:50.180 
anyway and one full banana break it up

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.360 
anyway and one full banana break it up
now<00:01:51.020> the<00:01:51.110> trick<00:01:51.320> to<00:01:51.410> making<00:01:51.440> a<00:01:51.740> great<00:01:51.920> protein

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:52.370 
now the trick to making a great protein

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:55.450 
now the trick to making a great protein
shake<00:01:52.580> obviously<00:01:53.060> is<00:01:53.180> ice<00:01:53.410> pull<00:01:54.410> more<00:01:54.710> or<00:01:55.100> some

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:55.460 
shake obviously is ice pull more or some

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:57.520 
shake obviously is ice pull more or some
fat-free<00:01:55.670> milk<00:01:56.030> but<00:01:56.870> the<00:01:56.930> most<00:01:57.080> important

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:57.530 
fat-free milk but the most important

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:59.470 
fat-free milk but the most important
thing<00:01:57.650> of<00:01:57.710> all<00:01:57.830> is<00:01:57.890> you<00:01:58.580> got<00:01:58.760> a<00:01:58.790> blender<00:01:59.240> you

00:01:59.470 --> 00:01:59.480 
thing of all is you got a blender you

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:01.720 
thing of all is you got a blender you
got<00:02:00.200> to<00:02:00.290> blend<00:02:00.440> it<00:02:00.590> for<00:02:00.620> about<00:02:00.740> 40<00:02:01.190> seconds<00:02:01.610> so

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:01.730 
got to blend it for about 40 seconds so
