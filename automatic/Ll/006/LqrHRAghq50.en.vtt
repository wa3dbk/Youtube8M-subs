the<00:02:06.739> finish<00:02:06.890> line<00:02:11.230> now<00:02:12.230> the<00:02:12.290> only<00:02:12.530> issue<00:02:12.769> with

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
the finish line now the only issue with

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:14.860 
the finish line now the only issue with
this<00:02:13.069> game<00:02:13.280> is<00:02:13.489> while<00:02:13.970> it's<00:02:14.090> loading<00:02:14.299> is<00:02:14.690> it's

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
this game is while it's loading is it's

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.140 
this game is while it's loading is it's
quite<00:02:15.140> a<00:02:15.170> heavy<00:02:15.560> download<00:02:16.220> and<00:02:16.519> as<00:02:16.790> you<00:02:16.970> can

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
quite a heavy download and as you can

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.400 
quite a heavy download and as you can
see<00:02:17.180> the<00:02:17.750> main<00:02:17.959> reason<00:02:18.410> is<00:02:18.530> it<00:02:19.100> looks<00:02:19.459> good<00:02:19.790> I

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
see the main reason is it looks good I

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.360 
see the main reason is it looks good I
mean<00:02:21.410> there's<00:02:21.590> no<00:02:21.709> doubt<00:02:21.920> about<00:02:21.950> it<00:02:22.220> that

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
mean there's no doubt about it that

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:27.400 
mean there's no doubt about it that
looks<00:02:22.780> impressive<00:02:25.989> so<00:02:26.989> we'll<00:02:27.139> skip<00:02:27.260> that

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 
looks impressive so we'll skip that

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:45.720 
looks impressive so we'll skip that
quickly<00:02:27.769> because<00:02:28.250> we're<00:02:28.430> rush<00:02:28.910> of<00:02:29.060> time

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.429 

now<00:02:46.730> I<00:02:46.760> haven't<00:02:47.359> actually<00:02:47.510> played<00:02:47.719> this<00:02:48.139> yet

00:02:48.429 --> 00:02:48.439 
now I haven't actually played this yet

00:02:48.439 --> 00:02:51.910 
now I haven't actually played this yet
so<00:02:48.999> this<00:02:49.999> is<00:02:50.030> a<00:02:50.299> new<00:02:50.719> experience<00:02:50.870> for<00:02:51.680> all<00:02:51.709> of

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920

us<00:02:52.159> together<00:02:53.230> and<00:02:54.230> I<00:02:54.530> believe<00:02:56.290> the

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
us together and I believe the

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:18.660 
us together and I believe the
accelerations<00:02:57.980> automatic

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:18.670 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:22.530

weight<00:03:24.880> control<00:03:25.090> we<00:03:25.510> can<00:03:25.540> sort<00:03:26.170> of<00:03:26.230> have<00:03:26.349> a

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:26.380 
weight control we can sort of have a

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:30.930 
weight control we can sort of have a
slightly<00:03:26.890> more<00:03:27.099> control<00:03:27.520> on<00:03:27.550> our<00:03:27.819> car<00:03:29.940> yeah

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:30.940

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480 
we'll use some moss why not we've

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.510 
we'll use some moss why not we've
already<00:03:34.599> totaled<00:03:35.080> our<00:03:35.140> car<00:03:35.170> once<00:03:35.650> mitel<00:03:36.280> do<00:03:36.400> it

already totaled our car once mitel do it
again<00:03:36.760> I<00:03:38.760> don't<00:03:39.760> think<00:03:40.000> we're<00:03:40.120> going<00:03:40.239> to<00:03:40.360> win

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:40.390 
again I don't think we're going to win

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:45.180 
again I don't think we're going to win
this<00:03:40.720> one<00:03:40.959> but<00:03:43.080> again<00:03:44.080> into<00:03:44.620> it<00:03:44.739> the<00:03:44.830> controls

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:45.190

this one but again into it the controls
actually<00:03:45.580> quite<00:03:45.790> intuitive<00:03:50.489> and<00:03:51.569> the<00:03:52.569> the

00:03:53.009 --> 00:03:53.019 
actually quite intuitive and the the

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:59.260 
actually quite intuitive and the the
graphics<00:03:53.440> are<00:03:53.620> supreme

the Windows Phone you'll feel right at
home<00:04:03.080> now<00:04:08.200> now<00:04:09.200> there's<00:04:09.380> a<00:04:09.470> starting<00:04:09.710> with<00:04:09.950> the

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:10.040 
home now now there's a starting with the

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:11.980 
home now now there's a starting with the
basic<00:04:10.430> cars<00:04:10.640> you<00:04:10.940> can<00:04:11.120> go<00:04:11.330> into<00:04:11.480> different

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:11.990 
basic cars you can go into different

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:14.020 
basic cars you can go into different
tiers<00:04:12.260> starting<00:04:12.740> from<00:04:12.920> 1<00:04:13.100> to<00:04:13.400> I<00:04:13.430> think<00:04:13.850> it's

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:14.030 
tiers starting from 1 to I think it's

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:16.690 
tiers starting from 1 to I think it's
seven<00:04:14.420> quickly<00:04:14.990> confirma<00:04:15.530> in<00:04:15.590> a<00:04:15.650> second<00:04:16.040> which

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:16.700 
seven quickly confirma in a second which

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:19.240 
seven quickly confirma in a second which
then<00:04:17.000> unlocks<00:04:17.480> faster<00:04:18.380> cars<00:04:18.590> more<00:04:18.830> powerful

vehicles you can command but I wouldn't
really<00:04:22.370> trust<00:04:22.730> myself<00:04:22.940> and<00:04:23.530> behind<00:04:24.530> the<00:04:24.620> wheel

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:17.800 
we have the multiplayer which is the

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:20.129 
we have the multiplayer which is the
most<00:06:17.949> as<00:06:18.280> I<00:06:18.400> said<00:06:18.639> just<00:06:19.419> now<00:06:19.510> it<00:06:19.690> start<00:06:19.930> with<00:06:20.020> yo

00:06:20.129 --> 00:06:20.139 
most as I said just now it start with yo

00:06:20.139 --> 00:06:21.689 
most as I said just now it start with yo
it's<00:06:20.290> the<00:06:20.410> most<00:06:20.590> interesting<00:06:21.190> part<00:06:21.430> of<00:06:21.580> this

00:06:21.689 --> 00:06:21.699 
it's the most interesting part of this

00:06:21.699 --> 00:06:22.890 
it's the most interesting part of this
because<00:06:22.030> you<00:06:22.120> have<00:06:22.210> the<00:06:22.300> local<00:06:22.570> multiplayer

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:22.900 
because you have the local multiplayer

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:24.750 
because you have the local multiplayer
which<00:06:23.110> is<00:06:23.229> what<00:06:23.380> we<00:06:23.470> used<00:06:23.680> to<00:06:23.919> but<00:06:24.430> you<00:06:24.550> also

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:24.760 
which is what we used to but you also

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:28.590 
which is what we used to but you also
have<00:06:25.180> online<00:06:26.100> and<00:06:27.100> this<00:06:27.340> isn't<00:06:27.790> through<00:06:28.060> Xbox

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:28.600 
have online and this isn't through Xbox

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:31.159 
have online and this isn't through Xbox
Live<00:06:28.870> this<00:06:29.050> is<00:06:29.199> through<00:06:29.380> game<00:06:29.590> loss<00:06:29.860> own

00:06:31.159 --> 00:06:31.169 
Live this is through game loss own

00:06:31.169 --> 00:06:34.230 
Live this is through game loss own
service<00:06:32.169> and<00:06:32.500> it<00:06:32.919> actually<00:06:33.130> as<00:06:33.610> far<00:06:33.880> as<00:06:34.000> we<00:06:34.120> can

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:34.240 
service and it actually as far as we can

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:38.420 
service and it actually as far as we can
tell<00:06:34.300> it<00:06:34.600> offers<00:06:34.930> real-time<00:06:35.260> multiplayer

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:38.430 

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:40.200 

unfortunately<00:06:39.430> there's<00:06:39.639> no<00:06:39.790> rooms<00:06:40.060> available

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:40.210 
unfortunately there's no rooms available

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:42.420 
unfortunately there's no rooms available
so<00:06:40.810> it<00:06:40.900> seems<00:06:41.139> that<00:06:41.290> no<00:06:41.440> one's<00:06:41.650> online<00:06:41.830> yet<00:06:42.280> so

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:42.430 
so it seems that no one's online yet so

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:44.250 
so it seems that no one's online yet so
have<00:06:42.550> to<00:06:42.669> give<00:06:42.820> that<00:06:42.970> some<00:06:43.180> time<00:06:43.449> to<00:06:43.720> populate

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:44.260 
have to give that some time to populate

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:45.600 
have to give that some time to populate
and<00:06:44.470> for<00:06:44.740> people<00:06:44.860> to<00:06:45.039> actually<00:06:45.250> start

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:45.610 
and for people to actually start

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:48.360 
and for people to actually start
connecting<00:06:46.449> to<00:06:46.780> the<00:06:46.870> online<00:06:46.990> service<00:06:47.470> and

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:48.370 
connecting to the online service and

00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:49.909 
connecting to the online service and
then<00:06:48.699> we'll<00:06:48.820> be<00:06:48.880> able<00:06:48.910> to<00:06:49.090> join<00:06:49.240> some<00:06:49.479> rooms

00:06:49.919 --> 00:06:52.110 
then we'll be able to join some rooms
you<00:06:50.919> can<00:06:51.039> also<00:06:51.160> create<00:06:51.430> your<00:06:51.610> own<00:06:51.699> room<00:06:52.000> and

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:52.120
