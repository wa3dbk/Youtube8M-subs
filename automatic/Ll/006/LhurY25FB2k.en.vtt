to<00:00:10.710> expand<00:00:11.160> your<00:00:11.340> color<00:00:11.610> palette<00:00:11.880> I'm<00:00:12.240> going

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
to expand your color palette I'm going

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.360 
to expand your color palette I'm going
to<00:00:12.540> show<00:00:12.719> you<00:00:12.750> how<00:00:13.019> to<00:00:13.080> take<00:00:13.320> two<00:00:13.559> independent

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
to show you how to take two independent

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.030 
to show you how to take two independent
colors<00:00:14.639> and<00:00:14.850> blend<00:00:15.450> them<00:00:15.660> into<00:00:16.049> a<00:00:16.080> nice<00:00:16.320> medium

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:17.040 
colors and blend them into a nice medium

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:19.580 
colors and blend them into a nice medium
third<00:00:17.400> color<00:00:17.790> we're<00:00:18.750> going<00:00:18.900> to<00:00:18.960> start<00:00:19.200> with

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
third color we're going to start with

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.950 
third color we're going to start with
lavender<00:00:20.070> and<00:00:20.160> violaceous<00:00:21.060> and<00:00:21.300> blend<00:00:21.689> so

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
lavender and violaceous and blend so

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.480 
lavender and violaceous and blend so
that<00:00:22.080> the<00:00:22.170> color<00:00:22.410> mix<00:00:22.740> is<00:00:22.920> somewhere<00:00:23.279> in<00:00:23.400> the

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
that the color mix is somewhere in the

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.019 
that the color mix is somewhere in the
middle<00:00:23.520> of<00:00:23.910> the<00:00:24.450> two<00:00:25.460> we're<00:00:26.460> going<00:00:26.550> to<00:00:26.640> start

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
middle of the two we're going to start

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.300 
middle of the two we're going to start
with<00:00:27.779> shuffled<00:00:28.320> fiber<00:00:28.560> which<00:00:28.859> means<00:00:29.070> that<00:00:29.220> it

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
with shuffled fiber which means that it

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.519 
with shuffled fiber which means that it
has<00:00:29.369> a<00:00:29.430> nice<00:00:29.640> tapered<00:00:30.119> end<00:00:30.300> and<00:00:30.570> that<00:00:31.350> makes

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
has a nice tapered end and that makes

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.410 
has a nice tapered end and that makes
the<00:00:31.680> fiber<00:00:31.920> easier<00:00:32.369> to<00:00:32.550> work<00:00:32.699> with<00:00:32.760> and<00:00:33.120> easier

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
the fiber easier to work with and easier

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.680 
the fiber easier to work with and easier
to<00:00:33.480> blend<00:00:34.100> I'm<00:00:35.100> going<00:00:35.250> to<00:00:35.309> take<00:00:35.519> bits<00:00:36.059> from

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
to blend I'm going to take bits from

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.729 
to blend I'm going to take bits from
both<00:00:37.290> colors<00:00:37.710> and<00:00:39.320> then<00:00:40.320> I'm<00:00:40.440> just<00:00:40.500> going<00:00:40.650> to

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
both colors and then I'm just going to

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.020 
both colors and then I'm just going to
do<00:00:40.860> some<00:00:41.070> straight<00:00:41.309> mixing<00:00:41.699> and<00:00:41.790> what<00:00:41.879> that

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
do some straight mixing and what that

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.579 
do some straight mixing and what that
means<00:00:42.180> is<00:00:42.420> it<00:00:42.540> weren't<00:00:42.690> we<00:00:42.870> shuffle<00:00:43.470> these

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:43.589 
means is it weren't we shuffle these

00:00:43.589 --> 00:00:45.320 
means is it weren't we shuffle these
we're<00:00:44.129> not<00:00:44.280> going<00:00:44.400> to<00:00:44.489> go<00:00:44.580> back<00:00:44.879> and<00:00:45.059> forth

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:45.330 
we're not going to go back and forth

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:47.180 
we're not going to go back and forth
we're<00:00:45.900> just<00:00:46.110> going<00:00:46.290> to<00:00:46.379> do<00:00:46.470> straight<00:00:46.710> mixing

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
we're just going to do straight mixing

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.610 
we're just going to do straight mixing
which<00:00:47.580> is<00:00:47.729> just<00:00:47.940> right<00:00:48.420> on<00:00:48.600> top<00:00:48.629> of<00:00:49.080> the

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
which is just right on top of the

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.619 
which is just right on top of the
original<00:00:49.949> position<00:00:50.309> so<00:00:50.460> I'm<00:00:50.820> putting<00:00:51.120> one

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
original position so I'm putting one

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.130 
original position so I'm putting one
color<00:00:51.960> right<00:00:52.620> on<00:00:52.650> top<00:00:53.040> of<00:00:53.309> the<00:00:53.460> other<00:00:54.080> and<00:00:55.080> then

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
color right on top of the other and then

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.160 
color right on top of the other and then
separate<00:00:55.589> into<00:00:56.070> two<00:00:56.250> and<00:00:56.930> then<00:00:57.930> I'm<00:00:58.019> going<00:00:58.110> to

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
separate into two and then I'm going to

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.410 
separate into two and then I'm going to
position<00:00:58.290> right<00:00:59.100> on<00:00:59.339> top<00:00:59.670> of<00:00:59.940> where<00:01:00.119> I<00:01:00.150> pulled

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
position right on top of where I pulled

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.149 
position right on top of where I pulled
apart<00:01:00.690> and<00:01:01.440> we're<00:01:01.530> just<00:01:01.619> going<00:01:01.769> to<00:01:01.830> repeat

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:02.159 
apart and we're just going to repeat

00:01:02.159 --> 00:01:05.859 
apart and we're just going to repeat
that<00:01:02.600> now<00:01:03.600> if<00:01:03.900> we<00:01:04.140> were<00:01:04.229> to<00:01:04.379> stop<00:01:04.619> right<00:01:04.890> here

00:01:05.859 --> 00:01:05.869 
that now if we were to stop right here

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:11.050 
that now if we were to stop right here
we<00:01:06.869> would<00:01:07.020> have<00:01:08.150> some<00:01:09.150> pretty<00:01:09.409> highlighted

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:11.060 
we would have some pretty highlighted

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:13.580 
we would have some pretty highlighted
mixed<00:01:12.060> colors<00:01:12.540> but<00:01:12.960> we're<00:01:13.110> not<00:01:13.290> we're<00:01:13.500> going

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
mixed colors but we're not we're going

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:19.010 
mixed colors but we're not we're going
to<00:01:13.680> blend<00:01:13.950> until<00:01:14.160> it's<00:01:14.490> a<00:01:14.580> solid<00:01:15.030> color<00:01:18.020> I'm

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
to blend until it's a solid color I'm

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.490 
to blend until it's a solid color I'm
going<00:01:19.200> to<00:01:19.260> use<00:01:19.440> an<00:01:19.770> extension<00:01:20.340> brush<00:01:20.790> and

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:21.500 
going to use an extension brush and

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.540 
going to use an extension brush and
blend<00:01:22.500> the<00:01:22.620> two<00:01:22.770> together<00:01:22.890> now<00:01:23.220> this<00:01:23.370> is<00:01:23.520> a

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:23.550 
blend the two together now this is a

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:25.670 
blend the two together now this is a
nylon<00:01:24.060> bristle<00:01:24.420> brush<00:01:24.660> so<00:01:24.870> it's<00:01:25.020> pretty<00:01:25.200> stiff

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
nylon bristle brush so it's pretty stiff

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.100 
nylon bristle brush so it's pretty stiff
and<00:01:26.010> what<00:01:26.850> that<00:01:27.000> does<00:01:27.210> is<00:01:27.360> it<00:01:27.480> forces<00:01:27.990> the

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
and what that does is it forces the

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:37.460 
and what that does is it forces the
fiber<00:01:28.410> into<00:01:28.800> each<00:01:29.670> other<00:01:35.420> if<00:01:36.420> you<00:01:36.930> see<00:01:37.200> any

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
fiber into each other if you see any

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.390 
fiber into each other if you see any
color<00:01:37.860> blocks<00:01:38.850> starting<00:01:39.570> to<00:01:39.750> form<00:01:40.110> and<00:01:40.409> you

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
color blocks starting to form and you

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.280 
color blocks starting to form and you
want<00:01:41.550> to<00:01:41.670> mix<00:01:41.850> those<00:01:42.060> out<00:01:42.360> to<00:01:42.659> simply<00:01:43.050> take

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
want to mix those out to simply take

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:54.090 
want to mix those out to simply take
them<00:01:43.500> and<00:01:43.740> pull<00:01:43.950> them<00:01:44.220> apart<00:01:44.570> specifically

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.100 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:55.770 

we're<00:01:54.730> just<00:01:54.820> going<00:01:54.970> to<00:01:55.030> keep<00:01:55.180> working<00:01:55.450> this

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:55.780 
we're just going to keep working this

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:05.890 
we're just going to keep working this
until<00:01:56.290> all<00:01:56.590> of<00:01:56.650> those<00:01:57.040> lines<00:01:57.430> fade<00:01:58.180> away

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:05.900 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:07.750 

this<00:02:06.470> is<00:02:06.620> starting<00:02:06.920> to<00:02:06.980> blend<00:02:07.190> out<00:02:07.340> quite<00:02:07.580> nice

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:07.760 
this is starting to blend out quite nice

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:15.820 
this is starting to blend out quite nice
so<00:02:11.920> pull<00:02:13.210> just<00:02:14.210> a<00:02:14.420> few<00:02:14.810> more<00:02:15.020> rotations<00:02:15.590> and<00:02:15.740> I

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
so pull just a few more rotations and I

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:25.340 
so pull just a few more rotations and I
think<00:02:16.010> we'll<00:02:16.160> have<00:02:16.190> it

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:27.260 

I<00:02:25.410> don't<00:02:26.010> know<00:02:26.100> if<00:02:26.160> you<00:02:26.250> can<00:02:26.370> see<00:02:26.550> this<00:02:26.730> is<00:02:27.180> a

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270 
I don't know if you can see this is a

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:29.210 
I don't know if you can see this is a
lighter<00:02:27.630> stripe<00:02:27.990> in<00:02:28.140> the<00:02:28.170> center<00:02:28.530> I'm<00:02:29.010> just

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
lighter stripe in the center I'm just

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:36.740 
lighter stripe in the center I'm just
going<00:02:29.340> to<00:02:29.370> pull<00:02:29.730> that<00:02:29.910> apart<00:02:35.480> I'm<00:02:36.480> just<00:02:36.630> going

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
going to pull that apart I'm just going

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.130 
going to pull that apart I'm just going
to<00:02:36.810> keep<00:02:36.990> mixing<00:02:37.170> until<00:02:37.590> that<00:02:37.890> stripe<00:02:38.190> is<00:02:38.370> gone

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140 
to keep mixing until that stripe is gone

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:44.180 
to keep mixing until that stripe is gone
pull<00:02:40.140> it<00:02:40.350> apart<00:02:41.390> and<00:02:42.390> set<00:02:42.890> from<00:02:43.890> the<00:02:44.010> brush

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
pull it apart and set from the brush

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:50.060 
pull it apart and set from the brush
through

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.070
