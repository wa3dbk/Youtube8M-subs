00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:11.010
 to put this course is minecraft 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:13.679
 this this square that you are seeing 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.540
 but I already have a course like 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.750
 what 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:21.210
 as with some mouse pins or not the 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.970
 move there is 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:27.239
 this morning the description there goes back to 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:30.180
 see this course is that the page the link 

00:00:27.239 --> 00:00:34.540

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:39.180
 but good is the page and today here 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:39.180
 to hit the anger I'm going to hit 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:47.370
 ok here are the diamond resources 

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:50.079
 there are still many cursors 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:53.460
 this page action on closing because 

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:53.460
 it's a crap 

00:00:53.490 --> 00:01:01.280
 the grandfather pasted a desk that like 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.280
 I already have it as I occupy it 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:11.060
 we are going to 

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:14.159
 to stick it here I just tell them we stick it 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:16.600
 and we put this 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:19.689
 we put you here 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:21.330
 Right click and then we give you extract 

00:01:19.689 --> 00:01:24.270
 here 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:27.420
 once done this will no longer serve 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.560
 Well, I'm going to save it and here 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.490
 we have left a folder that says 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:34.770
 Minecraft cursors once this is done 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:37.439
 here we open it and they have many cursors 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:40.140
 of these from the mouse that a country 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:42.520
 with a sword and I'm in a moment and 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.690
 I am using the sword 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:49.630
 we leave it open 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:49.630
 we are not going to cover the control 

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:57.490
 then we lower it where it says to mouse 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:57.490
 I wait in a while 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:06.180
 it does not go down and it says mouse very well there 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:08.759
 this page is no longer useful 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:12.870
 we are not going to aim 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:14.780
 then here should be like this in this 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:17.100
 should 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:20.160
 to be here 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:23.820
 ok very well now we open the one of the 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:26.030
 cursors and paste the cursor that you 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:26.030
 want 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:30.510
 that is, we drag and stick 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:37.910
 you can not do it, we're not going to walk 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:43.620
 and here we paste the cursor that we 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:46.740
 we want for example 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:48.930
 this is here is here 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:51.230
 normally I 'm going to put accept for 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.230
 that they see 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:03:00.580
 I'm going to lose control again 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:00.580
 time because we got here must 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:07.210
 after activity together and here he goes to 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:08.440
 appear as well as the selected mouse 

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:11.710
 Normal selection 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:16.240
 let's examine since there are things here 

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:18.790
 there are very good cursors open the cursors 

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:21.310
 of minecraft and have the one that you 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:24.690
 want, I'm going to hit the sword 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:24.690
 where is it hitting 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:30.900
 we give him here I know if he needs 

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:33.879
 provide administrator permissions 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:37.409
 to move this folder we can 

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:37.409
 continue her 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:41.400
 look let's continue 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:46.660
 Once this is done we can close in 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:48.790
 minecraft courses but I tell you 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:50.700
 that the cursor folder does not erase 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:53.970
 of Minecraft 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:55.430
 we 're not going to open them and we're going to 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:57.469
 to accept 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:59.209
 and well I hope you liked this 

00:03:57.469 --> 00:04:01.260
