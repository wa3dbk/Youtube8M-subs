00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
is the does support ddr3 but ddr2 is

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:25.870 
is the does support ddr3 but ddr2 is
fine

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:25.880 
fine

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:30.380

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
this video anyway there's kind of a

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.670 
this video anyway there's kind of a
close-up<00:02:36.660> look<00:02:38.480> at<00:02:39.480> the<00:02:39.840> board<00:02:40.049> you<00:02:40.319> can<00:02:40.500> run

close-up look at the board you can run

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.610 
close-up look at the board you can run
crossfire<00:02:41.430> in<00:02:42.260> this<00:02:43.260> on<00:02:43.620> this<00:02:43.890> board<00:02:44.130> but<00:02:44.370> not

SLI

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:57.330 

let's<00:02:54.260> take<00:02:54.440> a<00:02:54.470> look<00:02:54.680> at<00:02:54.890> what<00:02:55.370> it<00:02:55.490> comes<00:02:55.700> with

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
let's take a look at what it comes with

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:02.790 
let's take a look at what it comes with
so<00:02:58.340> this<00:02:58.520> board<00:02:59.410> comes<00:03:00.410> with<00:03:00.620> this<00:03:00.830> bracket

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:02.800 
so this board comes with this bracket

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:07.210 
so this board comes with this bracket
it's<00:03:03.800> got<00:03:03.950> two<00:03:04.190> weeks<00:03:04.400> out<00:03:04.640> of<00:03:04.670> connectors<00:03:06.220> and

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:07.220 
it's got two weeks out of connectors and

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:13.860 
it's got two weeks out of connectors and
a<00:03:07.370> molex<00:03:07.640> power<00:03:08.230> connector<00:03:10.030> so<00:03:11.030> you<00:03:11.120> can<00:03:11.480> guess

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:13.870 
a molex power connector so you can guess

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:16.780 
a molex power connector so you can guess
there's<00:03:14.870> your<00:03:15.459> hookups<00:03:16.459> for<00:03:16.520> your

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:16.790 
there's your hookups for your

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:19.840 
there's your hookups for your
motherboard<00:03:17.120> for<00:03:17.600> those<00:03:17.780> two<00:03:18.430> purple<00:03:19.430> ports

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:19.850 
motherboard for those two purple ports

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:23.560 
motherboard for those two purple ports
right<00:03:20.150> there<00:03:21.760> you<00:03:22.760> can<00:03:22.940> guess<00:03:23.180> what<00:03:23.420> we're

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:23.570 
right there you can guess what we're

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:27.580 
right there you can guess what we're
gonna<00:03:23.660> do<00:03:23.990> with<00:03:24.230> this<00:03:26.140> we're<00:03:27.140> going<00:03:27.290> to<00:03:27.350> use

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:27.590 
gonna do with this we're going to use

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:35.040 
gonna do with this we're going to use
this<00:03:28.420> cable<00:03:30.310> that<00:03:31.310> it<00:03:31.459> comes<00:03:31.700> with<00:03:33.700> that's<00:03:34.700> got

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:35.050 
this cable that it comes with that's got

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:43.420 
this cable that it comes with that's got
SATA<00:03:37.630> on<00:03:38.980> one<00:03:39.980> end<00:03:40.220> and<00:03:41.260> eSATA<00:03:42.260> on<00:03:43.100> the<00:03:43.280> other

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:43.430 
SATA on one end and eSATA on the other

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:48.780 
SATA on one end and eSATA on the other
end<00:03:43.730> and<00:03:45.730> we're<00:03:46.730> going<00:03:46.760> to<00:03:46.940> plug<00:03:47.209> in<00:03:47.270> a

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790 
end and we're going to plug in a

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:54.550 
end and we're going to plug in a
internal<00:03:49.790> hard<00:03:50.090> drive<00:03:51.040> along<00:03:52.040> with<00:03:52.250> this<00:03:53.560> SATA

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:54.560 
internal hard drive along with this SATA

00:03:54.560 --> 00:04:06.509 
internal hard drive along with this SATA
power<00:03:56.739> to<00:03:57.739> molex<00:04:02.860> so<00:04:03.860> you'd<00:04:04.250> plug<00:04:04.549> that<00:04:04.790> in<00:04:05.090> to

00:04:06.509 --> 00:04:06.519 
power to molex so you'd plug that in to

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:13.470 
power to molex so you'd plug that in to
this<00:04:07.570> and<00:04:09.489> be<00:04:10.489> able<00:04:10.610> to<00:04:10.790> run<00:04:11.090> your<00:04:11.260> internal

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:13.480 
this and be able to run your internal

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:18.400 
this and be able to run your internal
hard<00:04:14.480> drive<00:04:14.890> externally<00:04:16.959> and<00:04:17.959> that's<00:04:18.169> another

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:18.410 
hard drive externally and that's another

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:25.240 
hard drive externally and that's another
real<00:04:18.799> nice<00:04:19.370> feature<00:04:19.790> of<00:04:19.940> this<00:04:20.180> board<00:04:22.300> so<00:04:24.250> there

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:25.250 
real nice feature of this board so there

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:31.720 
real nice feature of this board so there
it<00:04:25.460> is<00:04:25.610> the<00:04:26.060> EP<00:04:26.810> 45<00:04:27.530> -<00:04:28.040> UD<00:04:28.720> 3p
