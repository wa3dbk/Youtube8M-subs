00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:04.140
 Now I will make exactly the same mix in a detachable form. 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.460
 This mix is ​​different from the one we do not have to cook 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.620
 but have to take GOLD TREASURE. 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:14.160
 We will see 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.960
 the gold Tresasure liquid with which we can produce the water soluble boilies 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.340
 and include all important ingredients. 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.540
 The flavor we use is Squid Octopus, Strawberry 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:33.980
 So polyp and octopus with strawberry flavor. 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.520
 Of course, that includes all the important ingredients for the boilies to work well. 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.760
 So I chose this combination Squid and Octopus, Strawberry 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.820
 because we often succeeded. 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:51.120
 Look at 1-2 pictures of the SBS Vip Cup where this combination was very successful. 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.220
 11.51 kg 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.420
 I also put the whole thing in the bucket. 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:12.980
 If you can see that is also with the other little oiled and sticky, 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.060
 You can still work with it very easily. 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.860
 In this container you will find the necessary amount which we will use for this mix. 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:26.560
 That's exactly 225 ml which we will fill up with 150 ml of water. 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.760
 That comes to the mix. 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.620
 Before we do that, shake well 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:33.900
 so that it mixes well 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:44.840
 and then you can too 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:50.880
 the water is coming 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.520
 up to 150 ml. 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:11.040
 I'll shake it a little so that every drop comes in. So we can knead the dough now. 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:27.220
 You can smell the smell of polip and octopus and the strawberry 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:29.560
 is really intense. 

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:42.980
 Again the dough is released from the container as you can see. 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:48.080
 Now comes the bag and the 5 minutes. 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:54.240
 5 minutes later... 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:02.360
 As before, we will push the dough out and form balls. 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:54.360
 We got Perfect balls again. 

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:59.940
 These boilies must be allowed to dry for 8-10 days then it will get the optimum consistency. 

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:03.900
 We can then use these well with a throw-away tube 

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:05.800
 and will not break. 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:10.520
 What's more important is that these water soluble boilies do not have to freeze. 

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:13.140
 Simply store in a cool room and 

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:14.040
 they will not mold. 

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:40.280
 With that, all loose boilies have been finished. 

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:49.160
 Now all we have to do is wait and dry the 8-10 days. 

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:52.340
 See you next time! 

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:53.700
 Goodbye!
