Google is starting a plot own internet
thing<00:02:11.400> slowly<00:02:12.150> but<00:02:12.480> surely

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
thing slowly but surely

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.050 
thing slowly but surely
they're<00:02:13.440> getting<00:02:13.620> it<00:02:13.980> hooked<00:02:14.580> up<00:02:14.700> in<00:02:14.879> like

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
they're getting it hooked up in like

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.479 
they're getting it hooked up in like
Kansas<00:02:15.989> City<00:02:16.200> Missouri<00:02:16.379> and<00:02:16.830> Kansas<00:02:17.040> City

Kansas City Missouri and Kansas City

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:21.830 
Kansas City Missouri and Kansas City
Kansas<00:02:18.450> so<00:02:19.230> that's<00:02:19.920> kind<00:02:20.610> of<00:02:20.700> real<00:02:21.000> places<00:02:21.360> but

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
Kansas so that's kind of real places but

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.380 
Kansas so that's kind of real places but
at<00:02:22.319> least<00:02:22.470> they<00:02:22.650> experimenting<00:02:23.640> out<00:02:24.030> they

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
at least they experimenting out they

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
would just be like garbage because let's

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.960 
would just be like garbage because let's
let's<00:02:29.910> think<00:02:30.150> about<00:02:30.239> it<00:02:30.890> it<00:02:31.890> just<00:02:31.950> wouldn't<00:02:32.549> so

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
let's think about it it just wouldn't so

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.059 
let's think about it it just wouldn't so
like<00:02:33.180> I<00:02:33.360> was<00:02:33.390> saying<00:02:33.569> would<00:02:34.530> you<00:02:34.560> buy<00:02:35.040> that

00:02:37.039 --> 00:02:37.049 
mess if it was like hooked up in New

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:40.130 
mess if it was like hooked up in New

at<00:02:40.200> least<00:02:40.290> I<00:02:40.470> wouldn't<00:02:40.829> so<00:02:41.269> that's<00:02:42.269> why<00:02:42.420> God

00:02:42.619 --> 00:02:42.629 
at least I wouldn't so that's why God

at least I wouldn't so that's why God

move on to the next topic point they
talked<00:02:47.280> about<00:02:47.310> and<00:02:47.790> it's<00:02:48.269> basically<00:02:48.480> just

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
talked about and it's basically just

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.069 
talked about and it's basically just
understanding<00:02:49.739> how<00:02:49.980> speeds<00:02:50.579> and<00:02:51.180> if<00:02:51.359> you<00:02:51.900> need

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
lance and all that mess then you

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:12.349 
lance and all that mess then you
probably<00:03:09.690> want<00:03:10.410> to<00:03:10.530> go<00:03:10.769> with<00:03:11.129> you<00:03:12.030> know<00:03:12.120> like

probably want to go with you know like

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:14.979 
probably want to go with you know like
comcast<00:03:12.930> speed<00:03:13.170> type<00:03:13.530> of<00:03:13.650> internet<00:03:14.010> uh

comcast speed type of internet uh

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:17.420 
comcast speed type of internet uh
another<00:03:15.989> tip<00:03:16.260> I<00:03:16.470> don't<00:03:16.680> know<00:03:16.769> if<00:03:16.890> this<00:03:17.010> applies

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
another tip I don't know if this applies

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:20.599 
another tip I don't know if this applies
that<00:03:17.730> much<00:03:18.000> but<00:03:18.900> they<00:03:19.349> say<00:03:19.560> to<00:03:19.620> negotiate<00:03:20.280> your

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:20.609 
that much but they say to negotiate your

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:23.089 
that much but they say to negotiate your
weight<00:03:20.910> now<00:03:21.180> this<00:03:21.750> can<00:03:21.959> happen<00:03:22.169> with<00:03:22.739> some

00:03:23.089 --> 00:03:23.099 
weight now this can happen with some

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:25.039 
weight now this can happen with some
small<00:03:23.549> companies<00:03:24.150> you<00:03:24.329> can<00:03:24.480> maybe<00:03:24.630> do<00:03:24.870> this

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:25.049 
small companies you can maybe do this

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:27.259 
small companies you can maybe do this
but<00:03:25.319> if<00:03:25.709> you<00:03:25.829> with<00:03:26.010> a<00:03:26.040> larger<00:03:26.700> company<00:03:26.880> that

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:27.269 
but if you with a larger company that

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:29.780 
but if you with a larger company that
services<00:03:27.870> most<00:03:28.650> of<00:03:28.980> the<00:03:29.069> region<00:03:29.280> you<00:03:29.579> learn

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
services most of the region you learn

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:32.270 
services most of the region you learn
then<00:03:30.480> that's<00:03:30.870> probably<00:03:31.049> not<00:03:31.859> going<00:03:32.040> to<00:03:32.160> work

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
then that's probably not going to work

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.280 
then that's probably not going to work
out<00:03:32.519> good<00:03:32.669> but<00:03:33.000> if<00:03:33.269> you're<00:03:33.480> like<00:03:33.660> a<00:03:33.720> region<00:03:34.169> of

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
out good but if you're like a region of

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:37.460 
out good but if you're like a region of
maybe<00:03:35.040> like<00:03:35.250> five<00:03:35.760> six<00:03:36.569> hundred<00:03:36.900> houses<00:03:37.109> that

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
maybe like five six hundred houses that

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:40.159 
maybe like five six hundred houses that
have<00:03:37.709> it<00:03:37.980> then<00:03:38.310> I<00:03:38.639> would<00:03:39.000> suggest<00:03:39.209> negotiating

00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:40.169 
have it then I would suggest negotiating

00:03:40.169 --> 00:03:42.830 
have it then I would suggest negotiating
advice<00:03:40.440> because<00:03:41.150> they<00:03:42.150> want<00:03:42.419> to<00:03:42.510> make<00:03:42.599> money

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
advice because they want to make money

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.050 
advice because they want to make money
so<00:03:43.290> anyway<00:03:43.859> they<00:03:44.069> can<00:03:44.099> make<00:03:44.370> money<00:03:44.579> they'll

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
so anyway they can make money they'll

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:47.120 
so anyway they can make money they'll
try<00:03:45.269> to<00:03:45.359> do<00:03:45.569> it<00:03:45.720> now<00:03:45.959> they<00:03:46.590> might<00:03:46.769> want<00:03:46.889> to<00:03:47.010> try

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.130 
try to do it now they might want to try

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:48.770 
try to do it now they might want to try
to<00:03:47.220> make<00:03:47.400> more<00:03:47.700> money<00:03:47.910> off<00:03:48.060> you<00:03:48.419> but<00:03:48.660> they're

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
still going trying to make so let's see

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.909 
still going trying to make so let's see
all<00:03:51.209> right<00:03:51.329> tip<00:03:51.959> I<00:03:52.109> wouldn't<00:03:52.410> really<00:03:52.500> suggest

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:52.919 
all right tip I wouldn't really suggest

all right tip I wouldn't really suggest
that<00:03:53.040> one<00:03:53.280> but<00:03:53.669> that's<00:03:54.239> a<00:03:54.540> that's<00:03:54.870> what<00:03:55.500> the
