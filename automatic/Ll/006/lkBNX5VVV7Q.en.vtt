00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
think about back injuries and lifting

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.989 
think about back injuries and lifting
weights<00:00:27.419> in<00:00:27.810> general<00:00:28.169> I<00:00:28.380> look<00:00:28.919> at<00:00:29.070> it<00:00:29.189> exactly

00:00:29.989 --> 00:00:29.999 
weights in general I look at it exactly

00:00:29.999 --> 00:00:32.330 
weights in general I look at it exactly
the<00:00:30.269> same<00:00:30.300> way<00:00:30.509> that<00:00:30.779> I<00:00:30.839> look<00:00:31.109> at<00:00:31.259> driving<00:00:31.949> my

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
the same way that I look at driving my

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.420 
the same way that I look at driving my
car<00:00:32.780> anywhere<00:00:33.780> so<00:00:34.380> we<00:00:34.530> all<00:00:34.770> know<00:00:35.070> that<00:00:35.100> no

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
car anywhere so we all know that no

there is a small chance that you will
get<00:00:40.500> into<00:00:40.710> an<00:00:40.890> accident<00:00:41.430> because<00:00:41.610> of<00:00:41.820> things

materials at the back I mean any number
of<00:00:51.150> things<00:00:51.360> could<00:00:51.600> happen<00:00:51.870> inclement<00:00:52.650> weather

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:52.950 
of things could happen inclement weather

your<00:00:53.700> car<00:00:54.000> breaks<00:00:54.330> down<00:00:54.500> you<00:00:55.500> just<00:00:55.620> get

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:55.830 
your car breaks down you just get

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:58.100 
your car breaks down you just get
unlucky<00:00:56.280> there's<00:00:56.970> so<00:00:57.270> many<00:00:57.450> different<00:00:57.930> things

00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:58.110 
unlucky there's so many different things

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:01.340 
unlucky there's so many different things
that<00:00:58.410> that<00:00:58.530> could<00:00:58.740> happen<00:00:58.980> and<00:01:00.350> realistically

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
that that could happen and realistically

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.110 
that that could happen and realistically
no<00:01:01.650> matter<00:01:01.830> how<00:01:02.160> good<00:01:02.370> of<00:01:02.400> a<00:01:02.520> driver<00:01:02.640> you<00:01:03.000> are

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
no matter how good of a driver you are

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.420 
no matter how good of a driver you are
there's<00:01:03.540> always<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:04.199> chance<00:01:04.439> that<00:01:04.619> you<00:01:04.979> could

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
there's always the chance that you could

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.179 
there's always the chance that you could
get<00:01:05.729> screwed<00:01:06.240> and<00:01:06.600> getting<00:01:06.960> an<00:01:07.079> accident<00:01:07.619> well

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
get screwed and getting an accident well

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.640 
get screwed and getting an accident well
again<00:01:08.700> same<00:01:09.510> thing<00:01:09.540> with<00:01:10.020> lifting<00:01:10.409> weights

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
again same thing with lifting weights

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:11.870 
again same thing with lifting weights
there<00:01:10.950> are<00:01:11.100> people<00:01:11.580> who<00:01:11.730> are<00:01:11.850> just

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
there are people who are just

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.960 
there are people who are just
genetically<00:01:12.890> predisposed<00:01:13.890> to<00:01:14.700> disc

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
genetically predisposed to disc

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.690 
genetically predisposed to disc
herniation<00:01:15.450> it's<00:01:16.020> just<00:01:16.320> a<00:01:16.440> fact<00:01:16.740> in<00:01:17.040> fact<00:01:17.550> I

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
herniation it's just a fact in fact I

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.820 
herniation it's just a fact in fact I
would<00:01:17.909> say<00:01:18.030> that<00:01:18.060> most<00:01:18.570> people<00:01:19.110> who<00:01:19.290> get<00:01:19.560> back

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
would say that most people who get back

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.760 
would say that most people who get back
injuries<00:01:20.420> probably<00:01:21.420> have<00:01:21.630> some<00:01:22.020> hereditary

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
injuries probably have some hereditary

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.550 
injuries probably have some hereditary
disposition<00:01:23.580> towards<00:01:24.360> back<00:01:24.600> problems<00:01:25.140> in<00:01:25.290> the

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
disposition towards back problems in the

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.610 
disposition towards back problems in the
first<00:01:25.860> place<00:01:26.130> so<00:01:26.820> even<00:01:27.300> if<00:01:27.600> you<00:01:28.200> live<00:01:28.409> with<00:01:28.590> a

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:28.620 
first place so even if you live with a

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:31.100 
first place so even if you live with a
perfectly<00:01:29.340> flat<00:01:29.760> back<00:01:30.180> and<00:01:30.450> you<00:01:30.570> use<00:01:30.720> a<00:01:30.750> belt

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
perfectly flat back and you use a belt

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.680 
perfectly flat back and you use a belt
on<00:01:31.350> all<00:01:31.740> of<00:01:31.979> your<00:01:32.100> sets<00:01:32.400> for<00:01:33.000> your<00:01:33.120> entire

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:33.690 
on all of your sets for your entire

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:35.960 
on all of your sets for your entire
lifting<00:01:34.500> career<00:01:34.890> there<00:01:35.490> is<00:01:35.640> still<00:01:35.940> a

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
lifting career there is still a

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.170 
lifting career there is still a
probability<00:01:36.630> that<00:01:36.990> you<00:01:37.830> will<00:01:38.310> get<00:01:38.580> hurt<00:01:38.880> you

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
probability that you will get hurt you

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.880 
probability that you will get hurt you
will<00:01:39.299> get<00:01:39.420> a<00:01:39.450> back<00:01:39.690> injury<00:01:39.990> of<00:01:40.140> some<00:01:40.170> kind<00:01:40.650> or

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
will get a back injury of some kind or

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.500 
will get a back injury of some kind or
you're<00:01:41.070> looking<00:01:41.190> career<00:01:41.610> and<00:01:41.790> of<00:01:42.090> course<00:01:42.360> the

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:42.510 
you're looking career and of course the

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:43.850 
you're looking career and of course the
longer<00:01:42.750> you<00:01:43.020> live<00:01:43.200> the<00:01:43.440> higher<00:01:43.650> this

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
longer you live the higher this

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.920 
longer you live the higher this
probability<00:01:44.549> is<00:01:44.580> because<00:01:45.510> you're<00:01:45.659> giving

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
probability is because you're giving

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.630 
probability is because you're giving
yourself<00:01:46.020> more<00:01:46.560> and<00:01:46.680> more<00:01:46.860> rules<00:01:47.220> of<00:01:47.400> the<00:01:47.490> die

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
yourself more and more rules of the die

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.990 
yourself more and more rules of the die
so<00:01:47.970> to<00:01:48.030> speak<00:01:48.680> and<00:01:49.680> you<00:01:49.950> just<00:01:50.130> either<00:01:50.400> accept

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
so to speak and you just either accept

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.969 
so to speak and you just either accept
that<00:01:51.119> or<00:01:51.270> you<00:01:51.600> don't<00:01:52.200> accept<00:01:52.619> it<00:01:52.710> and<00:01:52.890> you

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
that or you don't accept it and you

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.890 
that or you don't accept it and you
don't<00:01:53.190> with<00:01:53.310> weights<00:01:53.549> it's<00:01:53.850> your<00:01:54.090> decision

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:54.900 
don't with weights it's your decision

don't with weights it's your decision
you<00:01:54.990> know<00:01:55.110> we<00:01:55.619> all<00:01:55.740> ultimately<00:01:55.979> know<00:01:56.610> that

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
you know we all ultimately know that

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.340 
you know we all ultimately know that
there's<00:01:56.970> a<00:01:57.060> small<00:01:57.420> chance<00:01:57.750> of<00:01:57.960> us<00:01:58.229> getting

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
there's a small chance of us getting

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.410 
there's a small chance of us getting
into<00:01:58.710> our<00:01:58.890> car<00:01:59.159> and<00:01:59.369> then<00:01:59.640> never<00:01:59.940> getting<00:02:00.299> out

into our car and then never getting out
well<00:02:01.170> we<00:02:01.470> also<00:02:02.130> know<00:02:02.520> that<00:02:02.549> there's<00:02:02.939> a<00:02:03.000> small

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
well we also know that there's a small

well we also know that there's a small
chance<00:02:03.960> of<00:02:04.110> us<00:02:04.290> going<00:02:04.619> in<00:02:04.710> the<00:02:04.799> gym<00:02:05.040> pulling<00:02:05.850> a

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
chance of us going in the gym pulling a

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:08.539 
chance of us going in the gym pulling a
deadlift<00:02:06.330> and<00:02:06.479> snapping<00:02:07.260> our<00:02:07.740> all<00:02:07.770> up<00:02:07.950> go

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:08.549 
deadlift and snapping our all up go

00:02:08.549 --> 00:02:11.089 
deadlift and snapping our all up go
into<00:02:08.789> Stagg<00:02:09.000> city<00:02:09.360> and<00:02:09.629> never<00:02:09.869> coming<00:02:10.289> back<00:02:10.319> so

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
into Stagg city and never coming back so

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.490 
into Stagg city and never coming back so
your<00:02:11.370> decision<00:02:11.549> guys<00:02:12.000> you<00:02:12.840> had<00:02:13.020> to<00:02:13.140> make<00:02:13.319> a

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
your decision guys you had to make a

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.089 
your decision guys you had to make a
rational<00:02:14.030> calculated<00:02:15.030> choice<00:02:15.300> here<00:02:15.599> you<00:02:16.099> have

00:02:17.089 --> 00:02:17.099 
rational calculated choice here you have

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:18.140 
rational calculated choice here you have
a<00:02:17.370> very

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
a very

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.929 
a very
a<00:02:18.180> low<00:02:19.110> risk<00:02:19.470> for<00:02:19.799> hurting<00:02:20.280> your<00:02:20.400> back<00:02:20.519> but<00:02:20.849> the

00:02:20.929 --> 00:02:20.939 
a low risk for hurting your back but the

00:02:20.939 --> 00:02:23.059 
a low risk for hurting your back but the
risk<00:02:21.239> is<00:02:21.480> still<00:02:21.689> there<00:02:22.079> so<00:02:22.620> you<00:02:22.739> either<00:02:22.860> accept

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:23.069 
risk is still there so you either accept

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:24.770 
risk is still there so you either accept
it<00:02:23.370> or<00:02:23.459> you<00:02:23.610> don't<00:02:23.760> and<00:02:23.970> to<00:02:24.150> me<00:02:24.329> it's<00:02:24.480> really

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
it or you don't and to me it's really

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.750 
it or you don't and to me it's really
that<00:02:24.930> simple<00:02:24.959> now<00:02:25.829> let's<00:02:26.010> address<00:02:26.250> a<00:02:26.519> few

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
that simple now let's address a few

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.759 
that simple now let's address a few
other<00:02:26.939> things<00:02:27.209> namely<00:02:27.560> rounding<00:02:28.560> your<00:02:28.709> back

00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:28.769 
other things namely rounding your back

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:31.190 
other things namely rounding your back
there's<00:02:29.610> no<00:02:29.879> doubt<00:02:30.150> that<00:02:30.420> rounding<00:02:31.019> your<00:02:31.140> back

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
there's no doubt that rounding your back

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.500 
there's no doubt that rounding your back
in<00:02:31.620> my<00:02:31.920> opinion<00:02:32.370> is<00:02:32.549> analogous<00:02:33.090> to<00:02:33.209> the<00:02:33.390> person

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
in my opinion is analogous to the person

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.229 
in my opinion is analogous to the person
who<00:02:33.989> is<00:02:34.110> an<00:02:34.260> aggressive<00:02:34.829> driver<00:02:35.069> they<00:02:35.939> weave

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:36.239 
who is an aggressive driver they weave

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:40.099 
who is an aggressive driver they weave
in<00:02:36.480> and<00:02:36.599> out<00:02:36.659> of<00:02:36.840> lanes<00:02:37.129> they<00:02:38.329> you<00:02:39.329> know<00:02:39.450> speed

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:40.109 
in and out of lanes they you know speed

00:02:40.109 --> 00:02:43.970 
in and out of lanes they you know speed
they<00:02:40.829> run<00:02:41.370> every<00:02:42.030> red<00:02:42.209> light<00:02:42.239> if<00:02:43.079> it's<00:02:43.650> close

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
they run every red light if it's close

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.589 
they run every red light if it's close
you<00:02:44.310> know<00:02:44.340> those<00:02:44.609> sorts<00:02:44.849> of<00:02:44.879> things<00:02:45.090> all<00:02:45.390> these

00:02:45.589 --> 00:02:45.599 
you know those sorts of things all these

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:47.360 
you know those sorts of things all these
behaviors<00:02:45.780> that<00:02:46.230> we<00:02:46.349> know<00:02:46.560> that<00:02:47.250> are

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
behaviors that we know that are

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.339 
behaviors that we know that are
dangerous<00:02:47.640> texting<00:02:48.359> and<00:02:48.689> driving<00:02:48.810> they

00:02:49.339 --> 00:02:49.349 
dangerous texting and driving they

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:51.920 
dangerous texting and driving they
occasionally<00:02:50.010> get<00:02:50.310> no<00:02:51.060> tips<00:02:51.420> here<00:02:51.629> and<00:02:51.750> drive

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
occasionally get no tips here and drive

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:54.680 
occasionally get no tips here and drive
these<00:02:52.230> kind<00:02:52.500> of<00:02:52.590> people<00:02:52.980> are<00:02:53.299> have<00:02:54.299> a<00:02:54.329> much

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
these kind of people are have a much

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.509 
these kind of people are have a much
higher<00:02:54.959> risk<00:02:55.379> of<00:02:55.620> getting<00:02:56.220> in<00:02:56.310> an<00:02:56.400> accident

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:56.519 
higher risk of getting in an accident

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:58.339 
higher risk of getting in an accident
but<00:02:57.299> the<00:02:57.389> bottom<00:02:57.690> line<00:02:57.720> is<00:02:57.870> that<00:02:58.019> we<00:02:58.170> all<00:02:58.319> have

00:02:58.339 --> 00:02:58.349 
but the bottom line is that we all have

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:00.309 
but the bottom line is that we all have
friends<00:02:59.040> who<00:02:59.129> have<00:02:59.159> literally<00:02:59.700> gotten

drive got a DUI so you see it's all

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.259

about risk factors here guys you can't

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:21.199 
about risk factors here guys you can't
guarantee<00:03:18.659> anything<00:03:19.530> but<00:03:20.000> the<00:03:21.000> more

guarantee anything but the more

the higher your risks are and rounding

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.979 
the higher your risks are and rounding
your<00:03:25.019> back<00:03:25.079> is<00:03:25.500> one<00:03:25.949> such<00:03:26.400> behavior<00:03:27.030> now<00:03:27.629> one

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:27.989 
your back is one such behavior now one

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:29.360 
your back is one such behavior now one
of<00:03:28.019> the<00:03:28.139> things<00:03:28.379> that<00:03:28.560> gets<00:03:28.680> lost<00:03:28.919> on<00:03:29.129> people

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
of the things that gets lost on people

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:31.069 
of the things that gets lost on people
one<00:03:29.639> of<00:03:29.669> the<00:03:29.819> nuances<00:03:30.359> that<00:03:30.419> isn't<00:03:30.720> discussed

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:31.079 
one of the nuances that isn't discussed

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:32.449 
one of the nuances that isn't discussed
very<00:03:31.260> much<00:03:31.440> is<00:03:31.620> that<00:03:31.680> there<00:03:31.859> are<00:03:31.980> different

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
very much is that there are different

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:35.659 
very much is that there are different
degrees<00:03:32.639> of<00:03:33.000> rounding<00:03:33.989> and<00:03:34.220> the<00:03:35.220> if<00:03:35.430> you<00:03:35.639> are

00:03:35.659 --> 00:03:35.669 
degrees of rounding and the if you are

00:03:35.669 --> 00:03:37.550 
degrees of rounding and the if you are
in<00:03:35.819> what<00:03:36.150> I<00:03:36.180> would<00:03:36.389> call<00:03:36.569> full<00:03:37.079> flexion

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
in what I would call full flexion

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.250 
in what I would call full flexion
meaning<00:03:38.340> that<00:03:38.459> every<00:03:39.120> vertebrae<00:03:39.780> and<00:03:39.900> every

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
meaning that every vertebrae and every

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.110 
meaning that every vertebrae and every
disc<00:03:40.470> in<00:03:40.680> your<00:03:40.709> back<00:03:40.859> is<00:03:41.129> completely<00:03:41.849> around

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120

that is gonna be at a higher risk level

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.399 
that is gonna be at a higher risk level
than<00:03:44.489> somebody<00:03:44.849> who<00:03:45.000> exhibits<00:03:45.510> a<00:03:45.629> small

of<00:03:48.690> the<00:03:48.840> movement<00:03:49.109> so<00:03:49.979> if<00:03:50.220> you're<00:03:50.370> rounding

00:03:50.539 --> 00:03:50.549 
of the movement so if you're rounding

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:52.879 
of the movement so if you're rounding
just<00:03:50.970> a<00:03:51.060> little<00:03:51.329> bit<00:03:51.449> that's<00:03:51.810> safer<00:03:52.290> than

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:52.889 
just a little bit that's safer than

00:03:52.889 --> 00:03:55.189 
just a little bit that's safer than
rounding<00:03:53.639> a<00:03:53.790> whole<00:03:54.030> lot<00:03:54.299> but<00:03:54.569> it's<00:03:54.720> still<00:03:54.870> not

00:03:55.189 --> 00:03:55.199 
rounding a whole lot but it's still not

understand this advice if you're ok with

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:47.960 
understand this advice if you're ok with
rounding<00:04:47.010> your<00:04:47.130> upper<00:04:47.520> back

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:47.970 
rounding your upper back

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:51.860 
rounding your upper back
maybe<00:04:48.900> that's<00:04:49.350> less<00:04:49.680> risky<00:04:50.190> than<00:04:50.870> full

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:51.870 
maybe that's less risky than full

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:54.140 
maybe that's less risky than full
rounding<00:04:52.470> you<00:04:52.590> know<00:04:52.710> full<00:04:53.040> flexion<00:04:53.370> but<00:04:54.030> it

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:54.150 
rounding you know full flexion but it

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:56.360 
rounding you know full flexion but it
still<00:04:54.450> increases<00:04:55.110> your<00:04:55.290> risk<00:04:55.530> compared<00:04:56.220> to<00:04:56.340> a

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:56.370 
still increases your risk compared to a

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:57.890 
still increases your risk compared to a
flat<00:04:56.610> back<00:04:56.640> and<00:04:57.120> nobody<00:04:57.360> ever<00:04:57.450> talks<00:04:57.750> about

00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:57.900 
flat back and nobody ever talks about

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:00.050 
flat back and nobody ever talks about
that<00:04:58.320> the<00:04:58.950> second<00:04:59.280> thing<00:04:59.400> in<00:04:59.490> my<00:04:59.610> opinion<00:04:59.730> is

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:00.060 
that the second thing in my opinion is

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:01.940 
that the second thing in my opinion is
that<00:05:00.180> your<00:05:00.300> back<00:05:00.480> is<00:05:00.510> not<00:05:00.750> a<00:05:00.810> freaking<00:05:01.320> joint<00:05:01.680> I

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:01.950 
that your back is not a freaking joint I

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:04.370 
that your back is not a freaking joint I
mean<00:05:02.640> the<00:05:02.790> spine<00:05:03.090> has<00:05:03.330> a<00:05:03.360> bunch<00:05:03.810> of<00:05:03.930> Fassett

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:04.380 
mean the spine has a bunch of Fassett

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:06.980 
mean the spine has a bunch of Fassett
but<00:05:04.710> it's<00:05:05.190> all<00:05:05.430> interconnected<00:05:06.150> guys<00:05:06.330> so<00:05:06.630> if

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:06.990 
but it's all interconnected guys so if

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:08.270 
but it's all interconnected guys so if
you're<00:05:07.200> rounding<00:05:07.500> your<00:05:07.800> upper<00:05:08.100> back<00:05:08.250> the

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:08.280 
you're rounding your upper back the

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:09.890 
you're rounding your upper back the
chances<00:05:08.820> are<00:05:08.910> of<00:05:08.970> is<00:05:09.120> your<00:05:09.240> lower<00:05:09.390> back<00:05:09.630> is<00:05:09.780> in

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:09.900 
chances are of is your lower back is in

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:11.600 
chances are of is your lower back is in
at<00:05:10.020> least<00:05:10.080> some<00:05:10.470> degree<00:05:10.650> of<00:05:10.830> flexion<00:05:11.250> as<00:05:11.400> well

at least some degree of flexion as well

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:14.750 
at least some degree of flexion as well
you<00:05:12.090> can't<00:05:12.480> really<00:05:12.810> separate<00:05:13.530> them<00:05:13.800> you<00:05:14.460> can't

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:14.760 
you can't really separate them you can't

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:16.550 
you can't really separate them you can't
really<00:05:14.970> just<00:05:15.480> round<00:05:15.840> your<00:05:15.930> upper<00:05:16.050> back<00:05:16.320> or

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:16.560 
really just round your upper back or

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:23.900

and if you round any part of it you're

likely<00:05:24.360> to<00:05:24.540> be<00:05:24.660> rounding<00:05:25.080> the<00:05:25.230> whole<00:05:25.470> thing

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:25.890 
likely to be rounding the whole thing

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:27.770

just<00:05:26.220> to<00:05:26.340> different<00:05:26.670> degrees<00:05:27.000> so<00:05:27.630> what

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:27.780 
just to different degrees so what

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:29.330 
just to different degrees so what
happens<00:05:28.110> is<00:05:28.230> that<00:05:28.260> sometimes<00:05:28.710> people<00:05:28.770> see<00:05:29.130> a

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:29.340 
happens is that sometimes people see a

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:31.370 
happens is that sometimes people see a
