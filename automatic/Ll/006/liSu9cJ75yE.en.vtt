eight<00:00:05.160> worlds<00:00:05.609> and<00:00:05.759> today<00:00:05.910> we're<00:00:06.089> gonna<00:00:06.180> take

eight worlds and today we're gonna take

eight worlds and today we're gonna take
a<00:00:06.450> look<00:00:06.690> at<00:00:06.870> the<00:00:07.020> scar-h

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620 
a look at the scar-h

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
SV this was a rifle I reviewed a long

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.470 
SV this was a rifle I reviewed a long
time<00:00:10.769> ago<00:00:11.099> and<00:00:11.250> that<00:00:11.400> video<00:00:11.610> ended<00:00:12.120> up<00:00:12.240> being

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
time ago and that video ended up being

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.450 
time ago and that video ended up being
one<00:00:12.630> of<00:00:12.750> my<00:00:12.870> most<00:00:13.080> popular<00:00:13.349> DMR<00:00:14.070> videos

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
one of my most popular DMR videos

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.340 
one of my most popular DMR videos
despite<00:00:15.210> the<00:00:15.389> fact<00:00:15.599> that<00:00:15.690> I<00:00:15.780> didn't<00:00:16.109> really

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
despite the fact that I didn't really

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.529 
despite the fact that I didn't really
like<00:00:16.529> the<00:00:16.740> gun<00:00:16.980> so<00:00:17.789> what<00:00:17.940> was<00:00:18.150> the<00:00:18.359> problem

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
like the gun so what was the problem

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.779 
like the gun so what was the problem
with<00:00:18.779> the<00:00:18.840> scar-h<00:00:19.199> sv<00:00:19.920> and<00:00:20.100> what's<00:00:20.250> changed<00:00:20.699> to

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
with the scar-h sv and what's changed to

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:22.370 
with the scar-h sv and what's changed to
make<00:00:20.939> it<00:00:21.090> worthy<00:00:21.300> of<00:00:21.570> being<00:00:21.810> this<00:00:22.109> week's

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380

the muzzle velocity of this gun was

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.040 
the muzzle velocity of this gun was
considerably<00:00:26.880> buffed<00:00:27.180> in<00:00:27.390> the<00:00:27.480> recent<00:00:27.840> fall

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.100 
control - in general the scar-h SV was
previously<00:00:35.820> the<00:00:35.940> worst<00:00:36.300> of<00:00:36.540> what<00:00:36.719> I<00:00:36.899> would

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
previously the worst of what I would

call the three long-range DMR's in terms

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.990 
call the three long-range DMR's in terms
of<00:00:40.110> stats<00:00:40.350> it<00:00:40.559> was<00:00:40.680> almost<00:00:40.920> identical<00:00:41.250> to<00:00:41.879> the

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
of stats it was almost identical to the

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.720 
of stats it was almost identical to the
mark<00:00:42.180> 11<00:00:42.600> and<00:00:42.780> very<00:00:43.170> similar<00:00:43.500> to<00:00:43.770> the<00:00:43.860> SPD<00:00:44.399> 12

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
mark 11 and very similar to the SPD 12

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.700 
mark 11 and very similar to the SPD 12
but<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:45.120> reason<00:00:45.539> it<00:00:45.690> was<00:00:45.809> inferior<00:00:46.140> to<00:00:46.350> both

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
but the reason it was inferior to both

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.160 
but the reason it was inferior to both
was<00:00:47.250> because<00:00:47.579> of<00:00:47.700> its<00:00:47.820> low<00:00:48.120> 500<00:00:48.870> meters<00:00:49.140> a

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
was because of its low 500 meters a

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.500 
was because of its low 500 meters a

weapon a fast muzzle velocity is very

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.430 
weapon a fast muzzle velocity is very
important<00:00:53.940> because<00:00:54.090> it<00:00:54.600> not<00:00:54.660> only<00:00:54.840> makes<00:00:55.260> it

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
important because it not only makes it

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.560 
important because it not only makes it
easier<00:00:55.590> to<00:00:55.980> hit<00:00:56.100> moving<00:00:56.340> targets<00:00:56.579> it<00:00:57.239> also

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
always just felt more inaccurate and

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.530 
always just felt more inaccurate and
although<00:01:05.189> it<00:01:05.400> wasn't<00:01:05.610> a<00:01:05.760> massive<00:01:06.119> difference

there<00:01:06.930> really<00:01:07.140> wasn't<00:01:07.470> a<00:01:07.710> reason<00:01:07.890> to<00:01:08.189> use<00:01:08.400> this

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
there really wasn't a reason to use this
