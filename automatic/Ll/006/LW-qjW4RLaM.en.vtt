the inside and its main feature is that

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:54.150 
the inside and its main feature is that
big<00:01:51.070> palm<00:01:51.340> tree<00:01:52.289> where<00:01:53.289> I<00:01:53.320> remember<00:01:53.950> when<00:01:54.130> a

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:54.160 
big palm tree where I remember when a

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:57.120 
big palm tree where I remember when a
little<00:01:54.910> boy<00:01:55.090> the<00:01:55.479> the<00:01:56.229> palm<00:01:56.440> tree<00:01:56.679> was<00:01:56.860> about

00:01:59.850 --> 00:01:59.860 
as tall as the smooth part at the base

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:02.460 
as tall as the smooth part at the base
of<00:02:00.039> the<00:02:00.100> trunk<00:02:00.660> so<00:02:01.660> as<00:02:01.780> you<00:02:01.899> can<00:02:02.050> see<00:02:02.110> it's

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:02.470 
of the trunk so as you can see it's

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:07.649 
of the trunk so as you can see it's
grown<00:02:02.799> quite<00:02:03.189> a<00:02:03.220> lot<00:02:03.689> in<00:02:04.689> in<00:02:05.439> 30<00:02:05.770> years<00:02:06.659> and

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:07.659 
grown quite a lot in in 30 years and

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:11.400 
grown quite a lot in in 30 years and
then<00:02:07.960> if<00:02:08.110> we<00:02:08.350> just<00:02:09.149> have<00:02:10.149> a<00:02:10.179> look<00:02:10.360> we<00:02:11.049> can<00:02:11.230> see

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.410 
then if we just have a look we can see

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:18.140 
then if we just have a look we can see
los<00:02:11.620> Naranjo's
