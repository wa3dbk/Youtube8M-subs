Greg lake uses this a lot there a lot of

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:57.529 
Greg lake uses this a lot there a lot of
songs<00:01:56.190> that<00:01:56.340> have<00:01:56.580> this<00:01:56.729> style<00:01:57.030> in<00:01:57.269> them<00:01:57.390> as

00:01:57.529 --> 00:01:57.539 
songs that have this style in them as

00:01:57.539 --> 00:01:59.419 
songs that have this style in them as
opposed<00:01:58.200> to<00:01:58.289> alternate<00:01:58.739> picking<00:01:58.950> it's<00:01:59.160> really

00:01:59.419 --> 00:01:59.429 
opposed to alternate picking it's really

00:01:59.429 --> 00:02:00.650 
opposed to alternate picking it's really
important<00:01:59.789> that<00:01:59.849> you're<00:02:00.000> consistent<00:02:00.330> with

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:00.660 
important that you're consistent with

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:03.290 
important that you're consistent with
your<00:02:00.810> picking<00:02:00.989> and<00:02:01.289> in<00:02:02.129> the<00:02:02.459> cross<00:02:02.849> picking

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:03.300 
your picking and in the cross picking

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:05.139 
your picking and in the cross picking
style<00:02:03.660> which<00:02:03.929> are<00:02:04.110> generally<00:02:04.920> doing

00:02:05.139 --> 00:02:05.149 
style which are generally doing

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:07.880 
style which are generally doing
occasional<00:02:06.149> exceptions<00:02:06.569> but<00:02:06.750> is<00:02:07.140> you're

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
occasional exceptions but is you're

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.859 
occasional exceptions but is you're
hitting<00:02:08.190> a<00:02:08.250> string<00:02:08.580> in<00:02:08.789> the<00:02:08.879> direction<00:02:09.149> of<00:02:09.450> the

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
hitting a string in the direction of the

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.350 
hitting a string in the direction of the
next<00:02:10.259> string<00:02:10.590> so<00:02:11.190> in<00:02:11.610> this<00:02:11.819> case<00:02:12.060> we're<00:02:12.239> going

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
next string so in this case we're going

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.000 
next string so in this case we're going
from<00:02:12.480> the<00:02:12.599> third<00:02:12.810> string<00:02:13.140> to<00:02:13.349> the<00:02:13.440> first<00:02:13.739> to

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
from the third string to the first to

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.040 
from the third string to the first to
the<00:02:14.040> second<00:02:14.550> so<00:02:15.000> I<00:02:15.060> hit<00:02:15.239> the<00:02:15.269> third<00:02:15.599> and<00:02:15.870> I<00:02:15.900> hit

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
the second so I hit the third and I hit

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:17.449 
the second so I hit the third and I hit
it<00:02:16.080> as<00:02:16.230> a<00:02:16.260> down<00:02:16.560> because<00:02:16.920> I'm<00:02:17.040> headed<00:02:17.340> to<00:02:17.370> the

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
it as a down because I'm headed to the

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:19.850 
it as a down because I'm headed to the
first<00:02:17.760> now<00:02:18.659> when<00:02:18.780> I<00:02:18.810> hit<00:02:18.930> the<00:02:19.050> first<00:02:19.230> or<00:02:19.500> hit<00:02:19.709> it
