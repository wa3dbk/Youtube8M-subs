oil<00:03:33.750> so<00:03:34.170> protein<00:03:34.680> and<00:03:35.010> mean<00:03:35.370> oil<00:03:35.639> and<00:03:36.000> this<00:03:36.120> was

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:38.609 
also for thick curly hair but I actually

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:40.550 
also for thick curly hair but I actually
think<00:03:38.940> this<00:03:39.209> one<00:03:39.359> is<00:03:39.389> better<00:03:39.510> if<00:03:40.019> your<00:03:40.169> hair<00:03:40.410> is

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
think this one is better if your hair is

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.309 
think this one is better if your hair is
not<00:03:40.769> so<00:03:41.010> thick<00:03:41.250> I<00:03:41.370> think<00:03:41.609> it's<00:03:41.730> better<00:03:41.880> on<00:03:42.030> a

00:03:42.309 --> 00:03:42.319 
not so thick I think it's better on a

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:46.640 
not so thick I think it's better on a
finer<00:03:43.319> or<00:03:43.560> thinner<00:03:43.980> texture<00:03:44.370> hair<00:03:45.349> this<00:03:46.349> one

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
finer or thinner texture hair this one

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:49.430 
finer or thinner texture hair this one
um<00:03:47.370> it<00:03:47.609> smells<00:03:47.790> really<00:03:48.269> good<00:03:48.540> also<00:03:49.079> I<00:03:49.109> mean<00:03:49.380> the

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
um it smells really good also I mean the
