00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:14.560 
this one seems to be a bit better and

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:18.240 
this one seems to be a bit better and
it's<00:04:14.739> just<00:04:14.890> soon<00:04:16.229> just<00:04:17.229> some<00:04:17.410> glue<00:04:17.709> which<00:04:18.100> I

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:18.250 
it's just soon just some glue which I

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:20.729 
it's just soon just some glue which I
actually<00:04:18.400> I<00:04:18.989> stood<00:04:19.989> get<00:04:20.109> off<00:04:20.229> like<00:04:20.500> the<00:04:20.620> glue

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:20.739 
actually I stood get off like the glue

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:22.469 
actually I stood get off like the glue
can<00:04:20.889> come<00:04:21.070> off<00:04:21.220> you<00:04:21.910> guys<00:04:22.000> didn't<00:04:22.240> know<00:04:22.330> that

00:04:22.469 --> 00:04:22.479 
can come off you guys didn't know that

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:23.850 
can come off you guys didn't know that
but<00:04:22.600> like<00:04:22.750> there's<00:04:22.930> some<00:04:23.050> who<00:04:23.199> stands<00:04:23.500> around

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:23.860 
but like there's some who stands around

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:27.300 
but like there's some who stands around
the<00:04:24.070> back<00:04:25.080> spacing<00:04:26.080> is<00:04:26.410> not<00:04:26.590> quite<00:04:26.889> perfect

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:27.310 
the back spacing is not quite perfect

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:31.409 
the back spacing is not quite perfect
right<00:04:27.759> there<00:04:29.430> blue<00:04:30.430> stains<00:04:30.729> up<00:04:30.940> there<00:04:31.150> to

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:31.419 
right there blue stains up there to

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:35.520 
right there blue stains up there to
around<00:04:31.780> the<00:04:31.930> toe<00:04:32.199> Wow<00:04:33.100> got<00:04:33.580> really<00:04:33.789> bright<00:04:34.530> on

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:35.530 
around the toe Wow got really bright on

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:37.529 
around the toe Wow got really bright on
the<00:04:35.650> toe<00:04:35.830> so<00:04:36.430> yeah<00:04:36.910> it's<00:04:37.090> definitely<00:04:37.240> not<00:04:37.479> the

00:04:37.529 --> 00:04:37.539 
the toe so yeah it's definitely not the

00:04:37.539 --> 00:04:41.129 
the toe so yeah it's definitely not the
best<00:04:38.050> craftsmanship<00:04:39.389> let's<00:04:40.389> go<00:04:40.750> back<00:04:40.960> there

00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:41.139 
best craftsmanship let's go back there

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:42.990 
best craftsmanship let's go back there
too<00:04:41.410> so<00:04:42.220> it's<00:04:42.370> def<00:04:42.490> we're<00:04:42.610> not<00:04:42.699> the<00:04:42.789> best

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:43.000 
too so it's def we're not the best

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.279 
too so it's def we're not the best
craftsmanship<00:04:43.479> but<00:04:43.720> it's<00:04:43.870> really<00:04:44.050> not<00:04:44.229> that

00:04:44.279 --> 00:04:44.289 
craftsmanship but it's really not that

00:04:44.289 --> 00:04:46.830 
craftsmanship but it's really not that
big<00:04:44.590> of<00:04:44.650> a<00:04:44.770> problem<00:04:45.009> to<00:04:45.340> me<00:04:45.490> especially<00:04:46.389> when<00:04:46.720> I
