00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:33.810 
anytime I use it so for that purpose I
think<00:02:31.600> it's<00:02:31.959> very<00:02:32.140> good<00:02:32.440> when<00:02:33.010> it<00:02:33.160> comes<00:02:33.190> on<00:02:33.610> to

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:33.820 
think it's very good when it comes on to

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:37.500 
think it's very good when it comes on to
like<00:02:34.000> using<00:02:34.810> it<00:02:35.230> like<00:02:35.500> weekly<00:02:36.310> I<00:02:36.519> wouldn't<00:02:37.090> in

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
like using it like weekly I wouldn't in

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:39.660 
like using it like weekly I wouldn't in
my<00:02:37.840> opinion<00:02:38.260> I<00:02:38.380> wouldn't<00:02:38.709> recommend<00:02:38.980> it<00:02:39.430> for

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
my opinion I wouldn't recommend it for

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:42.780 
my opinion I wouldn't recommend it for
like<00:02:40.390> a<00:02:40.600> weekly<00:02:41.320> shampoo<00:02:41.650> because<00:02:42.250> as<00:02:42.400> I<00:02:42.549> said

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
like a weekly shampoo because as I said

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:45.570 
like a weekly shampoo because as I said
it<00:02:42.970> it<00:02:43.959> gives<00:02:44.230> my<00:02:44.500> hair<00:02:44.530> a<00:02:44.830> squeaky<00:02:45.340> clean

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:45.580 
it it gives my hair a squeaky clean

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:48.810 
it it gives my hair a squeaky clean
feeling<00:02:45.970> and<00:02:46.450> I<00:02:46.780> don't<00:02:46.989> think<00:02:47.260> um<00:02:47.530> I<00:02:48.340> think<00:02:48.430> if

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:48.820 
feeling and I don't think um I think if

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:50.880 
feeling and I don't think um I think if
you<00:02:48.940> continue<00:02:49.450> to<00:02:49.480> use<00:02:49.630> it<00:02:50.110> like<00:02:50.260> every<00:02:50.709> single

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
you continue to use it like every single

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:52.590 
you continue to use it like every single
week<00:02:51.130> like<00:02:51.340> over<00:02:51.670> time<00:02:51.940> it's<00:02:52.120> going<00:02:52.180> to<00:02:52.420> try

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:52.600 
week like over time it's going to try

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:53.190 
week like over time it's going to try
your<00:02:52.840> hero

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
your hero

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.330
