 controversial his name age

 children of men and precisely the 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:44.660
 storyline of the series does not remember 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:46.550

 up to here our selection today but 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.920
 they are not the only novelties impossible 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:01.569
 put them all in the program but 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:01.569
 we will talk about the rest calm 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:07.730
 this week the box office top is 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:10.340
 great on the one hand in second place 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:11.959
 we have rush a movie that tells the 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:14.330
 rivalry between formula pilots 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:17.110
 one james hahn and niki lauda very 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:17.110
 recommendable 

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:27.970
 there is something more powerful than fear of 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:29.800
 death the desire but today we talk about 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:31.690
 strong dish from the box office because in the 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:33.910
 number one on the list we have since 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:37.680
 a few days ago in cinema the impressive 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:37.680
 gravity 3d 

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:46.990
 and I just have to say it 

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:51.300
 in the club 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:02.220
 when he was talking about your love songs 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:03.810
 on a routine space mission something 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:06.120
 it goes wrong and two astronauts are left 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:07.860
 floating adrift through space by 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:09.810
 one side a smart engineer 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:11.760
 interpreted by sandra bullock and by 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:13.799
 another a veteran astronaut whom he gives 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:15.690
 life george clooney from the moment of 

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:17.639
 incident begins the countdown to 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:18.959
 try to go home for all 

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:20.340
 imaginable means 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:21.930
 despite the simple ones of the story 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:23.910
 gravity is a great movie that 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:25.530
 surprise on all sides the 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:27.360
 story is good and original that is 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:29.070
 very well dosed and well interpreted 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:31.139
 in this sense emphasize the 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:32.669
 bullet sandra bullock well with all 

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:34.889
 security the best thing he's ever done 

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:36.510
 but without leaving aside the quality of 

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:38.910
 the story the visual section is 

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:41.220
 amazing because it's not that the movie 

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:43.110
 has been designed for 3d but that 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:45.419
 rather it seems that 3d has been 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:47.039
 invented for this movie the 

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:48.780
 immersion feeling is such that 

00:04:47.039 --> 00:04:50.580
 you will end up dodging space junk 

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:52.229
 from your seat is attached to the good 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:54.120
 documentation of the series in matter 

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:55.949
 spatial becomes the experience of 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:58.380
 see this movie in practically a 

00:04:55.949 --> 00:05:00.780
 virtual trip to space we have an extra 

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:02.190
 small melodramatic dose punctual but 

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:04.260
 it passes without pain and acceleration 

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:05.430
 progressive events makes 

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:07.410
 you forget quickly 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:09.600
 what we consider an imperfection 

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:11.190
 minor in a great work the 

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:12.840
 proof that the graffiti is looking 

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:15.780
 we find it in your valuations in 

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:18.600
 filmaffinity we have in 79 m becomes a 

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:20.880
 impressive 8.4 and finally adding up 

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:23.250
 other opinions we leave the average in 8 

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:25.290
 with 2 an exciting movie with more 

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:27.390
 science fiction that like all kinds of 

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:30.290
 ideal audience to enjoy on screen 

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:30.290
 giant 

00:05:34.729 --> 00:05:39.669
 who do not know our dear macfarlane 

00:05:41.139 --> 00:05:50.180
 in a shit 

00:05:44.949 --> 00:05:53.349
 and is that water becomes the 

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:56.360
 experience in the invented all done 

00:05:53.349 --> 00:06:00.199
 interpretation or where each order a 

00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:02.380
 nice where each one bart an area where 

00:06:00.199 --> 00:06:07.230
 evil falls 

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:07.230
 more where I do not know
