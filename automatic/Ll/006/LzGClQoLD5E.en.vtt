00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:42.310 
we get that so see if you get it like
that<00:01:39.940> and<00:01:40.940> these<00:01:41.119> half<00:01:41.330> notes<00:01:41.360> the<00:01:41.810> two<00:01:41.990> counts

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:42.320 
that and these half notes the two counts

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:43.990

but<00:01:42.410> they're<00:01:42.619> fast<00:01:42.860> too<00:01:43.190> so<00:01:43.490> we<00:01:43.610> count<00:01:43.760> like

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.000 
but they're fast too so we count like

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:52.120 
but they're fast too so we count like
this<00:01:50.110> then<00:01:51.110> you<00:01:51.229> see<00:01:51.380> a<00:01:51.410> repeat<00:01:51.680> sign<00:01:51.890> so<00:01:52.070> you

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.130 
this then you see a repeat sign so you

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:54.370 
this then you see a repeat sign so you
go<00:01:52.250> back<00:01:52.430> and<00:01:52.610> do<00:01:52.670> it<00:01:52.700> again<00:01:52.960> the<00:01:53.960> next<00:01:53.990> time

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380 
go back and do it again the next time

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:55.690 
go back and do it again the next time
when<00:01:54.560> you<00:01:54.619> do<00:01:54.740> it<00:01:54.830> again<00:01:55.070> you<00:01:55.369> don't<00:01:55.520> play

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700 
when you do it again you don't play

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:00.130 
when you do it again you don't play
number<00:01:55.850> one<00:01:57.070> you<00:01:58.070> go<00:01:58.250> to<00:01:58.580> number<00:01:58.700> two<00:01:59.180> okay

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.140 
number one you go to number two okay

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:01.630 
number one you go to number two okay
so<00:02:00.350> you<00:02:00.410> don't<00:02:00.590> play<00:02:00.770> this<00:02:00.979> do<00:02:01.160> the<00:02:01.310> second

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:01.640 
so you don't play this do the second

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:42.300 
so you don't play this do the second
time<00:02:01.790> and<00:02:01.970> go<00:02:02.030> like

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:03:17.210 

there's<00:02:43.310> a<00:02:43.840> chance

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:21.930 

and<00:03:18.220> that's<00:03:18.790> that<00:03:19.000> so<00:03:19.420> into<00:03:19.900> it
