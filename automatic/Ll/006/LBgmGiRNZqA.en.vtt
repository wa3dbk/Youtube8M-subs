00:00:04.509 --> 00:00:10.389
 Hi, everyone , welcome to the board at 

00:00:07.599 --> 00:00:13.359
 we started to study the 

00:00:10.389 --> 00:00:16.359
 thermal conversion and in this class we 

00:00:13.359 --> 00:00:19.720
 we will see how thermal conversion is 

00:00:16.359 --> 00:00:22.570
 related to the formation of breezes and 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:25.680
 tank inversion and interrupts the 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:28.990
 convection currents movements 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:32.259
 Let's start with the breezes. 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:35.050
 there is a difference between heat 

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:37.749
 specific sand and specific heat 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:40.600
 water being a specific heat of the 

00:00:37.749 --> 00:00:44.229
 less than the specific heat of the 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:48.550
 because of this difference during the 

00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:51.789
 day the sand heats up faster and 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:55.600
 the air on the sand becomes more air 

00:00:51.789 --> 00:00:58.959
 hot than the air that is on the water 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:02.859
 hot air because it is less dense will rise 

00:00:58.959 --> 00:01:05.019
 towards the atmosphere and because of 

00:01:02.859 --> 00:01:09.070
 air movement 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:12.460
 the pressure on the sand decreases over 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:15.580
 water is therefore colder air on 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:19.270
 there is greater pressure on water 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:22.630
 difference in pressure pushes the air 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:26.140
 is on the water toward the sand 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:29.590
 at night there is an inversion the 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:32.710
 here is on the water gets warmer 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:36.340
 since the water takes to cool 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:39.610
 while the air that is on the sand 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:43.030
 becomes colder since it was and 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:45.810
 cools faster than water 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:49.840
 hot water that is on the water will 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:54.070
 towards the atmosphere and through 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:57.010
 pressure on the water will decrease 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:58.030
 as the pressure on the sand is now 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:03.340
 bigger 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:06.909
 the cold air is pushed towards the sea 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:10.000
 this displacement of cold air following the 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:10.810
 direction of the sand or towards 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.170
 to the sea 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:15.470
 we call it a breeze being that during 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:18.680
 the day 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:22.580
 the breeze is a sea breeze since the air 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:25.930
 It comes from the beach toward the sand and 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:30.260
 during the night the breeze is called 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:34.070
 terrestrial breeze since the cold air follows 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:36.650
 from the sand towards the beach when we 

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:39.980
 we think in breeze the chains of 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:44.060
 convection become quite friendly right 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:47.420
 but there may be problems related 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:50.330
 with the convection currents actually 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:53.360
 the convection currents themselves are not 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:56.390
 a problem but the interruption of these 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:57.950
 currents can cause very 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:01.120
 in the environment 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:03.380
 one of these problems is caused by 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:07.610
 thermal inversion 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:10.190
 thermal inversion is related to the 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:14.090
 winter what happens during the summer 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:16.940
 the upper air layers are air 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:20.300
 colder than the nearest layers 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:23.030
 of the soil this temperature difference 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:26.180
 occurs mainly because of the 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:29.360
 release of hot gases from cars and 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:33.980
 of industries as the closest to the 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:37.130
 The soil is hot and it performs a 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:40.610
 that is up going toward 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:44.540
 atmosphere meanwhile the colder air 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:48.170
 of the atmosphere moves towards the ground 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:51.650
 when in this warm air and light with you 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:55.850
 pollutants and in the atmosphere 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:59.660
 pollutants are dissolved during the 

00:03:55.850 --> 00:04:02.299
 see what happens during winter is 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:05.420
 that even with the release of gases 

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:09.470
 cars and industries 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:13.940
 the air near the ground is usually more 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:16.880
 cold air from the atmosphere as the air 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:20.450
 closer to the sun is colder than air 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:23.690
 of the atmosphere itself can not 

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:26.470
 perform the upward movement and 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:29.790
 therefore pollutants are not 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:33.520
 taken towards the atmosphere being 

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:36.490
 accumulated closer to the ground and this 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:39.100
 accumulation of pollution near the ground 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:43.060
 causes an increase in diseases 

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:46.750
 the thermal inversion 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:50.320
 with cooler air near the ground and 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:52.480
 prevents pollutants from being carried 

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:54.940
 towards the atmosphere 

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:59.520
 good people, I hope you have 

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:59.520
 Enjoy this class, continue studying.
