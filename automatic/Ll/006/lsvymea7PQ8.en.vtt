00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.220
 Hello, this porsche today 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.099
 tell you how to do well let's say 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:11.670
 car with steering wheel 

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:17.580
 something that's on the type of things you see here 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:21.660
 rotate and here it doesn't matter my 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:26.820
 Design thought was something like 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:30.769
 gazelki make fun general 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.769
 Reception tidy side 

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:44.600
 very rock tire was all funny 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:52.190
 the machine turned out even broader 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:59.270
 sorry principle based on the steering wheel 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:01:03.100
 which rotates nicholas on what 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:03.100
 Keeps wheels know is called 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:12.170
 I'll show you how to do without water 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:12.170
 outdoor romance that is so u 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:27.170
 so we succeeded I will do knew for 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:32.090
 start we take the usual 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:37.000
 Usually such a thing went know who 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:39.369
 location and set 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:48.459
 anything on what will be 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:51.459
 wheels are strongly axes we take to do 

00:01:48.459 --> 00:01:51.459
 make 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:03.159
 we take just rovnenko and fix 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.899
 eg 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:08.520
 still much of a difference it will not 

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:08.520
 play future 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:20.020
 I brought two 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:27.980
 they are separated 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:31.100
 now we do the network ourselves on some 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:36.260
 Now I take a piece of iron attracted 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:38.090
 when i am a trial copy first 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.280
 the axis that we will have in front of the car 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:41.349
 we stick with our so dreamed 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:46.459
 father 

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:49.130
 she will now rotate here 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:51.700
 see how much we want so much she 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:54.500
 will be right now which side 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:58.600
 any side will rotate the second 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:58.600
 with the usual us gold easy 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:08.530
 the problem is put like this almost 

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:12.780
 perfect now here this here we don't 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:16.349
 touches the nearest elements there 10 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.349
 machine structure 

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:23.739
 the principle of the machine is almost ready 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:27.790
 now we need two things first 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:29.159
 put or you put the wheels yourself 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:34.329
 wheel 

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:37.359
 damn and actually removes the tricks 

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:41.680
 which frauds first put 

00:03:37.359 --> 00:03:48.669
 the steering wheel we take we put it on 46 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:53.879
 how do we put him on scissors 

00:03:48.669 --> 00:03:56.980
 braking the friction remove power 

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:59.739
 at the same time braking power must be 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:01.810
 such a coefficient so to speak so 

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:06.750
 turned well but then 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:10.150
 Immediately it slowed down we need more 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:13.919
 easier to put power can not then 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:13.919
 already not and now we are fine 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:23.700
 yeah so here and now just take and 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:27.460
 Huldim the wheel precisely to the axis which 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:29.860
 Website articles glued which revolves 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:31.360
 should now we turn the wheels 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:36.310
 with him turns 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:39.880
 steering beam and forgot to say that all 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:43.660
 the beam and the wheel should work correctly 

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:45.550
 to be on the same vertical, that is, if we 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:49.270
 attach this wheel launched center 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:52.810
 our car here is this beam will not be 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:58.169
 rotate with him and here are such 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:05:02.800
 we are the world first ordinary wheel 

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:06.100
 we put abnormal wheels on 

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:12.130
 volt deuce and vosmerochku can nafig 

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:15.880
 remove already braking it so there 

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:19.060
 Iâ€™m still going to show you how to check 

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:20.960
 will she drive on here's how you see 

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:24.520
 she is with us 

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:24.520
 and turns 

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:33.810
 such a little bit wrong 

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:37.000
 braking on this wheel 

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:41.710
 slow everyone starts though herself 

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:43.390
 the car got pretty quickly shorter 

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:46.270
 gram we take just such a detail 

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:48.670
 but not necessarily kurevin but the essence of that 

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:50.770
 to take care of 

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:54.520
 front axle so that it does not spin on 

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:57.570
 place then now the moment she will 

00:05:54.520 --> 00:06:01.780
 scroll through yourself and 

00:05:57.570 --> 00:06:09.070
 unfold that is also the same 

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:11.230
 lg method is fine now if you 

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:15.070
 noticed she won't turn in 

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:16.830
 she can be like this 

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:20.480
 internally 

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:20.480
 that is, do not turn 

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:32.490
 I did not expect such a fact that she 

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:33.930
 it will be better yet 

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:36.590
 our principle is based 

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:40.410
 car it all may be different 

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:43.020
 what you want you can even do 8 

00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:45.660
 sharp car then nobody you 

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:48.780
 prevent him from doing maybe i even 

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:50.880
 Today I will show how to make it all 

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:53.270
 thanks for watching like everyone 

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:53.270
 until
