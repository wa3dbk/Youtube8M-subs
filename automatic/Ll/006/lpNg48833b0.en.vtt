back<00:03:04.670> from<00:03:04.850> TNA<00:03:05.450> I<00:03:05.600> think<00:03:06.020> you<00:03:06.080> won<00:03:06.290> like<00:03:06.500> one

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:06.890 
back from TNA I think you won like one

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:08.650 
back from TNA I think you won like one
match<00:03:07.160> and<00:03:07.460> that<00:03:07.490> match<00:03:07.820> was<00:03:07.850> that<00:03:08.150> walk<00:03:08.450> down

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:08.660 
match and that match was that walk down

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:09.790 
match and that match was that walk down
I<00:03:08.840> don't<00:03:08.900> think<00:03:09.080> he's<00:03:09.170> ever<00:03:09.290> won<00:03:09.560> a<00:03:09.590> match

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:09.800 
I don't think he's ever won a match

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:13.480 
I don't think he's ever won a match
actually<00:03:10.100> at<00:03:10.430> impact<00:03:10.910> but<00:03:11.720> um<00:03:11.980> gunner<00:03:12.980> up<00:03:13.250> the

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:13.490 
actually at impact but um gunner up the

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:15.130 
actually at impact but um gunner up the
Television<00:03:14.030> Champion<00:03:14.060> actually<00:03:14.900> looked

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:15.140 
Television Champion actually looked

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:17.320 
Television Champion actually looked
pretty<00:03:15.830> good<00:03:16.160> in<00:03:16.220> this<00:03:16.520> match<00:03:16.730> he<00:03:17.000> didn't<00:03:17.210> look

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:17.330 
pretty good in this match he didn't look

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:19.360 
pretty good in this match he didn't look
all<00:03:17.540> that<00:03:17.570> bad<00:03:17.720> he<00:03:18.050> actually<00:03:18.190> seemed<00:03:19.190> like<00:03:19.340> a

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.370 
all that bad he actually seemed like a

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:21.520 
all that bad he actually seemed like a
pretty<00:03:19.640> okay<00:03:20.060> wrestler<00:03:20.570> in<00:03:20.930> the<00:03:20.990> ring<00:03:21.110> so<00:03:21.500> I

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:21.530 
pretty okay wrestler in the ring so I

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:24.580 
pretty okay wrestler in the ring so I
think<00:03:21.740> in<00:03:22.190> due<00:03:22.970> time<00:03:23.240> he<00:03:23.420> could<00:03:23.660> improve<00:03:24.230> and

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:24.590 
think in due time he could improve and

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:29.050 
think in due time he could improve and
maybe<00:03:25.460> start<00:03:25.850> impressing<00:03:26.330> people<00:03:27.250> on<00:03:28.250> Samoa

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.060
