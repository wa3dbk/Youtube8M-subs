fingernail in there there we go to lift
this<00:02:57.489> up<00:02:57.670> this<00:02:58.450> whole<00:02:58.630> piece<00:02:58.780> comes<00:02:58.989> down

00:02:59.039 --> 00:02:59.049 
this up this whole piece comes down

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:00.600 
this up this whole piece comes down
there's<00:02:59.380> a<00:02:59.410> couple<00:02:59.530> tabs<00:02:59.860> here<00:03:00.099> on<00:03:00.220> his<00:03:00.370> back

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:00.610 
there's a couple tabs here on his back

it's lot in here I turn its head around
and<00:03:05.310> then<00:03:06.310> this<00:03:06.430> propeller<00:03:06.790> piece<00:03:07.000> turned<00:03:07.239> to

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
and then this propeller piece turned to

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.589 
and then this propeller piece turned to
the<00:03:07.569> side<00:03:07.750> to<00:03:08.319> be<00:03:08.410> flat<00:03:09.150> well<00:03:10.150> you<00:03:10.239> can't<00:03:10.480> leave

the side to be flat well you can't leave
it<00:03:10.750> back<00:03:10.870> like<00:03:11.079> that<00:03:11.370> it's<00:03:12.370> entirely<00:03:12.640> of<00:03:12.790> you

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:12.940 
it back like that it's entirely of you

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:15.240

and you sit here and you can as you can

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:16.500 
and you sit here and you can as you can
fold<00:03:15.489> them<00:03:15.640> up<00:03:15.670> like<00:03:15.849> this<00:03:16.000> but<00:03:16.239> then<00:03:16.390> they

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
fold them up like this but then they

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:17.850 
fold them up like this but then they
just<00:03:16.720> sit<00:03:16.900> up<00:03:16.930> just<00:03:17.260> take<00:03:17.380> out<00:03:17.470> to<00:03:17.560> the<00:03:17.650> sides

you fold these down there's really no

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.449 
you fold these down there's really no
friction<00:03:20.380> but<00:03:20.530> if<00:03:20.650> you<00:03:20.769> fold<00:03:21.010> them<00:03:21.130> both<00:03:21.280> up

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:21.459 
friction but if you fold them both up

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:22.770 
friction but if you fold them both up

00:05:39.149 --> 00:05:40.069 
fingers and what's cool about this these
are<00:05:39.209> actually<00:05:39.569> a<00:05:39.599> little<00:05:39.659> better<00:05:39.869> than<00:05:40.019> I

00:05:40.069 --> 00:05:40.079 
are actually a little better than I

expected to flip the fingers flip out

00:05:42.059 --> 00:05:43.670 
expected to flip the fingers flip out
you<00:05:42.539> rotate<00:05:42.869> this<00:05:42.990> whole<00:05:43.169> piece<00:05:43.349> down<00:05:43.529> to

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:43.680 
you rotate this whole piece down to

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:45.499 
you rotate this whole piece down to
bring<00:05:43.829> the<00:05:43.949> peg<00:05:44.159> up<00:05:44.339> and<00:05:44.759> then<00:05:44.849> the<00:05:44.969> thumb<00:05:45.269> is

00:05:45.499 --> 00:05:45.509 
bring the peg up and then the thumb is

00:05:45.509 --> 00:05:48.290 
bring the peg up and then the thumb is
on<00:05:45.779> a<00:05:46.589> hinge<00:05:46.919> here<00:05:47.189> but<00:05:47.369> it<00:05:47.459> also<00:05:47.610> hinges<00:05:48.119> this

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:48.300 
on a hinge here but it also hinges this

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:49.850 
on a hinge here but it also hinges this
way<00:05:48.479> so<00:05:48.539> you<00:05:48.779> doesn't<00:05:49.229> have<00:05:49.349> to<00:05:49.469> just<00:05:49.499> be<00:05:49.680> like

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:49.860 
way so you doesn't have to just be like

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:51.920 
way so you doesn't have to just be like
a<00:05:49.919> grabby<00:05:50.249> and<00:05:50.369> you<00:05:50.669> can<00:05:50.789> fold<00:05:50.999> it<00:05:51.149> up<00:05:51.269> and<00:05:51.419> have

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:51.930 
a grabby and you can fold it up and have

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:54.019 
a grabby and you can fold it up and have
a<00:05:51.990> natural-looking<00:05:52.469> thumb<00:05:52.949> you<00:05:53.699> can<00:05:53.789> bring<00:05:53.909> it

00:05:54.019 --> 00:05:54.029 
a natural-looking thumb you can bring it

00:05:54.029 --> 00:05:56.209 
a natural-looking thumb you can bring it
down<00:05:54.269> so<00:05:54.990> you've<00:05:55.110> actually<00:05:55.259> got<00:05:55.559> despite<00:05:56.129> the

00:05:56.209 --> 00:05:56.219 
down so you've actually got despite the

00:05:56.219 --> 00:05:57.649 
down so you've actually got despite the

get<00:06:24.929> to<00:06:24.990> in<00:06:25.699> later<00:06:26.699> reviews<00:06:27.119> and<00:06:27.300> then<00:06:27.419> we

00:06:27.889 --> 00:06:27.899 
get to in later reviews and then we

00:06:27.899 --> 00:06:30.469 
get to in later reviews and then we
actually<00:06:27.990> get<00:06:28.229> to<00:06:28.259> the<00:06:28.409> core<00:06:28.860> bodies<00:06:29.240> leg<00:06:30.240> mode

00:06:30.469 --> 00:06:30.479 
actually get to the core bodies leg mode

00:06:30.479 --> 00:06:33.949 
actually get to the core bodies leg mode
is<00:06:31.789> continued<00:06:32.789> footing<00:06:33.119> that<00:06:33.149> turns<00:06:33.839> head

00:06:33.949 --> 00:06:33.959 
is continued footing that turns head

00:06:33.959 --> 00:06:37.129 
is continued footing that turns head
back<00:06:34.110> around<00:06:35.659> clip<00:06:36.659> his<00:06:36.779> head<00:06:36.899> all<00:06:37.019> the<00:06:37.050> way

00:06:37.129 --> 00:06:37.139 
back around clip his head all the way

00:06:37.139 --> 00:06:40.669 
back around clip his head all the way
around<00:06:38.869> again<00:06:39.869> you<00:06:40.019> can<00:06:40.139> bring<00:06:40.289> that<00:06:40.349> forward

00:06:40.669 --> 00:06:40.679 
around again you can bring that forward

00:06:40.679 --> 00:06:41.910 
around again you can bring that forward
if<00:06:40.889> you<00:06:40.949> want

00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:41.920 
if you want

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:43.830 
if you want
so<00:06:42.730> I<00:06:42.760> guess<00:06:42.970> this<00:06:43.060> knee<00:06:43.270> that<00:06:43.390> they<00:06:43.480> gave<00:06:43.660> up

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:43.840 
so I guess this knee that they gave up

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:45.690 
so I guess this knee that they gave up
the<00:06:43.930> ability<00:06:43.960> to<00:06:44.320> turn<00:06:44.440> like<00:06:44.650> that<00:06:44.680> but<00:06:45.010> okay

00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:45.700 
the ability to turn like that but okay

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:48.750 
the ability to turn like that but okay
so<00:06:45.940> bring<00:06:46.600> it<00:06:46.690> down<00:06:46.900> I<00:06:47.580> basically<00:06:48.580> are

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:48.760 
so bring it down I basically are

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:51.060 
so bring it down I basically are
transforming<00:06:49.210> it<00:06:49.330> back<00:06:49.540> to<00:06:50.320> helicopter<00:06:50.890> mode

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:51.070 
transforming it back to helicopter mode

00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:55.880 
transforming it back to helicopter mode
arms<00:06:51.790> pegged<00:06:52.090> in<00:06:52.380> collapses<00:06:53.380> legs<00:06:53.760> goes<00:06:54.760> out

00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:55.890 
arms pegged in collapses legs goes out

00:06:55.890 --> 00:07:01.950 
arms pegged in collapses legs goes out
collapse<00:06:56.890> these<00:06:57.070> up<00:06:57.310> I<00:06:59.340> just<00:07:00.340> like<00:07:00.460> that<00:07:00.960> I'll

00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:01.960 
collapse these up I just like that I'll

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:06.090 
collapse these up I just like that I'll
in<00:07:02.400> pull<00:07:03.400> that<00:07:03.550> back<00:07:03.700> down<00:07:04.800> fold<00:07:05.800> this<00:07:05.920> part

00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:06.100 
in pull that back down fold this part

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:11.130 
in pull that back down fold this part
back<00:07:06.310> up<00:07:06.520> I<00:07:08.250> just<00:07:09.250> like<00:07:09.400> that<00:07:09.670> and<00:07:10.360> then<00:07:11.080> you

00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:11.140 
back up I just like that and then you

00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:12.540 
back up I just like that and then you
just<00:07:11.260> take<00:07:11.530> this<00:07:11.710> turn<00:07:12.010> it<00:07:12.100> back<00:07:12.130> into<00:07:12.460> the

00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:12.550 
just take this turn it back into the

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:15.090 
just take this turn it back into the
flat<00:07:12.820> foot<00:07:13.090> mode<00:07:13.330> this<00:07:14.260> is<00:07:14.440> the<00:07:14.620> heat<00:07:14.830> kind<00:07:15.010> of

00:07:15.090 --> 00:07:15.100 
flat foot mode this is the heat kind of

00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:17.850 
flat foot mode this is the heat kind of
heel<00:07:15.340> spur<00:07:15.610> here<00:07:15.940> and<00:07:16.410> then<00:07:17.410> just<00:07:17.560> plug<00:07:17.740> it

00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:17.860 
heel spur here and then just plug it

00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:19.110 
heel spur here and then just plug it
into<00:07:17.950> the<00:07:18.100> bottom<00:07:18.370> of<00:07:18.460> the<00:07:18.520> helicopter<00:07:18.730> again

00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:19.120

and there's his leg mode and again we'll

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:24.300 
and there's his leg mode and again we'll
get<00:07:22.630> to<00:07:22.750> how<00:07:22.840> about<00:07:23.020> functions<00:07:23.440> when<00:07:24.070> we<00:07:24.160> get

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:24.310 
get to how about functions when we get

00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:27.660 
get to how about functions when we get
