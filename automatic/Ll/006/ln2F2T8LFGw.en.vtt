all right today we're going to discuss

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:05.809 
all right today we're going to discuss
on<00:00:02.429> how<00:00:02.460> to<00:00:02.669> build<00:00:03.060> a<00:00:03.389> wire<00:00:03.720> harness<00:00:03.959> for<00:00:04.830> a<00:00:04.890> pit

00:00:05.809 --> 00:00:05.819 
on how to build a wire harness for a pit

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:08.600 
on how to build a wire harness for a pit
bike<00:00:06.000> or<00:00:06.420> four-wheeler<00:00:07.400> there's<00:00:08.400> going<00:00:08.490> to<00:00:08.550> be

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
bike or four-wheeler there's going to be

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.190 
bike or four-wheeler there's going to be
a<00:00:08.670> simple<00:00:09.000> wire<00:00:09.179> harness<00:00:09.660> it's<00:00:09.870> going<00:00:10.019> to<00:00:12.200> this

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
a simple wire harness it's going to this

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.289 
a simple wire harness it's going to this
will<00:00:13.410> not<00:00:13.559> have<00:00:13.769> any<00:00:13.980> batteries<00:00:14.460> or<00:00:14.759> lights<00:00:14.969> or

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
will not have any batteries or lights or

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:16.910 
will not have any batteries or lights or
anything<00:00:15.480> like<00:00:15.690> that<00:00:15.750> this<00:00:16.260> is<00:00:16.440> just<00:00:16.680> to<00:00:16.800> get

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
anything like that this is just to get

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.480 
anything like that this is just to get
the<00:00:16.980> the<00:00:17.640> bike<00:00:17.850> running<00:00:18.150> basic<00:00:18.750> wire<00:00:18.900> system

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:19.490 
the the bike running basic wire system

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:21.950 
the the bike running basic wire system
what<00:00:20.490> we'll<00:00:20.609> do<00:00:20.730> is<00:00:20.850> we'll<00:00:20.970> take<00:00:21.119> them<00:00:21.390> to<00:00:21.420> two

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
what we'll do is we'll take them to two

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.710 
what we'll do is we'll take them to two
wires<00:00:22.199> these<00:00:23.100> are<00:00:23.279> different<00:00:23.550> stages<00:00:23.760> I<00:00:24.240> think

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
wires these are different stages I think

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.179 
wires these are different stages I think
this<00:00:24.869> is<00:00:24.960> actually<00:00:25.109> a<00:00:25.320> Honda<00:00:25.680> standard<00:00:26.039> only

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
this is actually a Honda standard only

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.179 
this is actually a Honda standard only
has<00:00:26.430> two<00:00:26.609> wires<00:00:26.820> coming<00:00:27.090> out<00:00:27.390> of<00:00:27.449> it<00:00:27.980> one<00:00:28.980> will

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
has two wires coming out of it one will

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:30.950 
has two wires coming out of it one will

trigger the black and red is what

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:40.760 
trigger the black and red is what
charges<00:00:35.730> up<00:00:35.910> your<00:00:38.450> electronics<00:00:39.450> and<00:00:39.750> the<00:00:40.500> blue

charges up your electronics and the blue

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.889 
charges up your electronics and the blue
ones<00:00:41.040> what<00:00:41.399> triggers<00:00:41.730> it<00:00:41.760> off<00:00:41.940> this<00:00:42.270> sent<00:00:42.809> us

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
ones what triggers it off this sent us

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.510 
ones what triggers it off this sent us
here<00:00:43.070> spark<00:00:44.070> quo

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520

you<00:00:45.120> got<00:00:45.300> a<00:00:45.329> CDI<00:00:47.870> this<00:00:48.870> is<00:00:48.989> a<00:00:49.020> different<00:00:49.320> kind

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
you got a CDI this is a different kind

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.229 
you got a CDI this is a different kind
of<00:00:49.530> stator<00:00:49.770> this<00:00:50.190> is<00:00:50.309> one<00:00:50.460> actually<00:00:50.820> runs<00:00:51.030> all

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
of stator this is one actually runs all

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:52.250 
of stator this is one actually runs all
your<00:00:51.390> lights<00:00:51.600> and<00:00:51.780> everything<00:00:52.079> you<00:00:52.170> don't

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
your lights and everything you don't

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.770 
your lights and everything you don't
have<00:00:52.410> to<00:00:52.559> close<00:00:52.770> packs<00:00:53.070> on<00:00:53.280> the<00:00:54.000> black<00:00:54.480> coil

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
have to close packs on the black coil

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.220 
have to close packs on the black coil
pack<00:00:55.020> is<00:00:55.199> a<00:00:55.230> primary<00:00:55.770> coil<00:00:56.809> this<00:00:57.809> is<00:00:58.020> what

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
pack is a primary coil this is what

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.529 
pack is a primary coil this is what
gives<00:00:58.500> you<00:00:58.710> your<00:00:58.949> spark<00:00:59.609> this<00:01:00.000> one<00:01:00.210> does<00:01:00.390> all

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
gives you your spark this one does all

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.840 
gives you your spark this one does all
your<00:01:00.660> lighting<00:01:00.870> like<00:01:01.079> I<00:01:01.170> said<00:01:01.789> these<00:01:02.789> are

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
your lighting like I said these are

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.080 
your lighting like I said these are
grounded<00:01:03.329> out<00:01:03.739> once<00:01:04.739> you<00:01:04.949> screw<00:01:05.460> them<00:01:05.610> on<00:01:05.820> so

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
grounded out once you screw them on so

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.630 
grounded out once you screw them on so
you<00:01:06.150> don't<00:01:07.110> actually<00:01:07.320> have<00:01:07.619> to<00:01:07.680> use<00:01:07.799> the<00:01:08.280> green

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
you don't actually have to use the green

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.190 
you don't actually have to use the green
wire<00:01:09.200> it<00:01:10.200> is<00:01:10.710> connected<00:01:11.280> right<00:01:11.780> to<00:01:12.780> your<00:01:12.960> plate

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
wire it is connected right to your plate

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.980 
wire it is connected right to your plate
however<00:01:13.830> does<00:01:14.670> help<00:01:14.939> when<00:01:15.570> running

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
however does help when running

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.020 
however does help when running
electronics<00:01:16.650> so<00:01:16.920> you<00:01:17.460> don't<00:01:17.610> have<00:01:17.729> any<00:01:17.850> kind

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
electronics so you don't have any kind

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.679 
electronics so you don't have any kind
of<00:01:18.090> imporant<00:01:18.509> interference<00:01:19.080> anyway<00:01:19.979> alright

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:20.689 
of imporant interference anyway alright

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:23.450 
of imporant interference anyway alright
so<00:01:21.689> looking<00:01:22.049> at<00:01:22.229> the<00:01:22.350> black<00:01:22.560> back<00:01:22.890> of<00:01:23.040> our<00:01:23.189> plug

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
so looking at the black back of our plug

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.960 
so looking at the black back of our plug
that<00:01:24.000> plugs<00:01:24.060> into<00:01:24.479> our<00:01:24.630> CDI<00:01:25.020> our<00:01:25.500> top<00:01:26.310> left<00:01:26.729> one

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
that plugs into our CDI our top left one

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.789 
that plugs into our CDI our top left one
is<00:01:27.270> a<00:01:27.330> blue<00:01:27.900> and<00:01:27.930> white<00:01:28.200> our<00:01:30.020> bottom<00:01:31.020> left<00:01:31.470> is<00:01:31.740> a

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
is a blue and white our bottom left is a

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.179 
is a blue and white our bottom left is a
green<00:01:32.630> the<00:01:33.630> bottom<00:01:33.990> in<00:01:34.110> the<00:01:34.200> middle<00:01:34.500> is<00:01:34.740> a

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
green the bottom in the middle is a

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.580 
green the bottom in the middle is a
black<00:01:35.549> and<00:01:35.790> white<00:01:35.970> and<00:01:36.360> that's<00:01:37.079> actually<00:01:37.470> to<00:01:37.560> a

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
black and white and that's actually to a

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.850 
black and white and that's actually to a
kill<00:01:37.829> switch<00:01:38.060> your<00:01:39.060> red<00:01:39.270> comes<00:01:40.140> from<00:01:40.470> your

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
kill switch your red comes from your

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.649 
kill switch your red comes from your
stator<00:01:41.479> which<00:01:42.479> is<00:01:42.810> actually<00:01:43.710> your<00:01:44.299> black<00:01:45.299> and

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
stator which is actually your black and

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.960 
stator which is actually your black and
red<00:01:45.960> would<00:01:46.590> punch<00:01:46.890> into<00:01:47.100> this<00:01:47.280> particular<00:01:47.610> one

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
red would punch into this particular one

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.960 
red would punch into this particular one
that<00:01:48.000> would<00:01:48.180> be<00:01:48.299> going<00:01:48.450> into<00:01:48.780> the<00:01:48.899> red<00:01:49.970> your

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
that would be going into the red your

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.569 
that would be going into the red your
top<00:01:51.210> right<00:01:51.240> that<00:01:51.540> one<00:01:51.960> is<00:01:52.110> actually<00:01:52.579> yellow

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
top right that one is actually yellow

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.069 
top right that one is actually yellow
and<00:01:53.880> black<00:01:54.119> coming<00:01:54.479> out<00:01:54.600> there<00:01:54.840> and<00:01:54.990> that's

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
and black coming out there and that's

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:58.639 
and black coming out there and that's
what<00:01:55.320> actually<00:01:55.439> goes<00:01:55.799> to<00:01:56.070> your<00:01:56.130> coil<00:01:57.649> we've

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
what actually goes to your coil we've

00:01:58.649 --> 00:01:59.749 
what actually goes to your coil we've
got<00:01:58.740> two<00:01:58.860> different<00:01:58.950> kind<00:01:59.219> of<00:01:59.280> cool<00:01:59.490> packs

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
got two different kind of cool packs

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.840 
got two different kind of cool packs
here<00:02:00.000> this<00:02:00.600> is<00:02:00.780> a<00:02:00.810> two<00:02:00.960> wire<00:02:01.350> it's<00:02:02.310> got<00:02:02.520> a<00:02:02.549> green

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
here this is a two wire it's got a green

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:58.099 
ground wire actually they all have to
ground<00:03:55.709> it<00:03:55.799> out<00:03:55.919> i<00:03:56.189> plugs<00:03:56.849> into<00:03:57.000> here<00:03:57.299> now<00:03:57.509> if

00:03:58.099 --> 00:03:58.109 
ground it out i plugs into here now if

00:03:58.109 --> 00:03:59.839 
ground it out i plugs into here now if
you<00:03:58.199> notice<00:03:58.560> there's<00:03:58.769> another<00:03:58.859> connector

00:03:59.839 --> 00:03:59.849 
you notice there's another connector

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:04.369 
you notice there's another connector
here<00:04:01.519> you<00:04:02.519> definitely<00:04:02.729> want<00:04:03.299> to<00:04:03.569> round<00:04:04.109> this

00:04:04.369 --> 00:04:04.379 
here you definitely want to round this

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:06.979 
here you definitely want to round this
to<00:04:04.650> your<00:04:04.949> frame<00:04:05.250> so<00:04:05.819> you<00:04:05.909> have<00:04:06.329> a<00:04:06.599> ground

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:06.989 
to your frame so you have a ground

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:09.890 
to your frame so you have a ground
because<00:04:07.590> you<00:04:07.769> do<00:04:07.979> not<00:04:08.159> have<00:04:08.549> your<00:04:09.419> green<00:04:09.689> wire

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 
because you do not have your green wire

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:11.420 
because you do not have your green wire
hooked<00:04:10.199> up<00:04:10.379> you've<00:04:10.680> got<00:04:10.799> to<00:04:10.919> have<00:04:11.009> a<00:04:11.069> ground<00:04:11.250> in

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:11.430 
hooked up you've got to have a ground in

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:13.339 
hooked up you've got to have a ground in
order<00:04:11.579> to<00:04:11.639> get<00:04:11.759> spark<00:04:12.180> so<00:04:12.689> you've<00:04:13.049> either<00:04:13.199> got

00:04:13.339 --> 00:04:13.349 
order to get spark so you've either got

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:17.779 
order to get spark so you've either got
to<00:04:15.259> you<00:04:16.259> just<00:04:16.440> got<00:04:16.560> to<00:04:16.680> ground<00:04:17.340> this<00:04:17.489> one<00:04:17.669> out

00:04:17.779 --> 00:04:17.789 
to you just got to ground this one out

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:19.699 
to you just got to ground this one out
somewhere<00:04:18.209> off<00:04:18.359> your<00:04:18.570> CD<00:04:18.870> I<00:04:18.900> it<00:04:19.349> has<00:04:19.500> to<00:04:19.620> be

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:19.709 
somewhere off your CD I it has to be

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:22.020 
somewhere off your CD I it has to be
grounded<00:04:20.070> somewhere<00:04:20.459> to<00:04:20.609> your<00:04:20.760> front

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:22.030 
grounded somewhere to your front

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:24.540 
grounded somewhere to your front
and<00:04:22.120> that<00:04:22.360> is<00:04:22.480> it<00:04:22.870> wiring<00:04:23.800> harness<00:04:24.130> very

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:24.550 
and that is it wiring harness very

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:26.940 
and that is it wiring harness very
simple
