00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:12.100
 this video is sponsored by copy 

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:13.510
 jones 4 the application that allows you to 

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:15.070
 transfer the content of your idevice 

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:16.660
 to your computer 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:17.590
 hello i have an ipod touch to taxes and 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:19.150
 today I will show 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:21.070
 the accelerate app for your 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:23.050
 jabri idevice that it's less 5.0 and 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:24.760
 even high school this zero point + access 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:26.349
 of anxious app which is free 

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:28.179
 on cydia and what she can do 

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:30.250
 I do not know if you saw the 

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:32.170
 applications speedtest fire that all of that 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:33.520
 well, it speeds up 

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:35.590
 animations of your idevice 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:37.060
 so it's like a small boost its 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:38.800
 over does that it will accelerate the 

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:40.570
 animations then that will give you like 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:43.059
 illusion that your idevice is 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:45.340
 extremely fast play its cause that the 

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:47.440
 animations are more accelerated so we 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:48.879
 can accelerate them make them more 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:49.629
 water is you who decide the 

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:51.190
 configuration 

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:55.059
 I even find it an application 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:57.010
 very complete for internships 

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:58.420
 of animation the opl and the apli of the same 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:00.160
 so all you have to face is 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:01.719
 installed confirmed once was 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.039
 installed a product designed springboard from 

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:04.360
 your device but not renewing a 

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:05.590
 section in the settings 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.930
 look at the speeds that are going to open 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:09.370
 the settings so we saw that 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:10.840
 the animation was very fast 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:12.880
 Finally I have to do but it is very 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.409
 fast then young wolf is very 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.970
 fast especially when applications 

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:17.700
 without are in the multitasking 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:19.710
 it's getting more and more of a price 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:23.170
 with now we are going down 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.880
 accelerate here so firstly you 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:27.250
 have the morning of course and 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.720
 acceleration if you who decide so 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:30.790
 let's admit you want to put it faster 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:32.320
 possible but everything to do with the fact that 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:34.000
 would have an instantaneous speed at 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.979
 this hurt anyway plus the time to see 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.229
 animation for example you want to see it 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:41.079
 a pure drive but draws more water 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:42.850
 in ferrari recover risky even made 

00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:46.420
 to do everything he had so much to see himself 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:48.700
 sprinters which we see that it becomes 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:51.340
 in normal mode if you want that's the 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:53.320
 normal mode fax also speed 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:55.540
 of normal animation the suspect go there a 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.979
 little more water too so here we see 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:59.920
 that it's a lot more water in term 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:02.290
 animations like those we'll go 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.789
 a little bit more water with age one 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:05.710
 not go down too low for a while 

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:07.810
 a minute to open a section but 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:09.009
 you understand principle you is what 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:10.840
 you will go higher it is at the top 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:12.580
 of the normal world I find that 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.920
 ferrari is a good ridgewell speed 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:18.440
 the scene even if here up below 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:20.600
 0 axelle red and animations 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:23.600
 way it's just modes for 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:25.970
 simply disable your title 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:27.800
 two accelerations facam and others 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:29.750
 epochs your spinning wheel be these cases 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:31.820
 there putting his load and rising 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:33.500
 little road turns makes sense of a 

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:35.510
 needle goes up but you can not 4 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.520
 rotates at a speed made endless 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:39.170
 I activate soft savoie disable it 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:40.730
 do it you also do not have to 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.010
 other syria metals if you have a 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:45.110
 iphone 4s to metal then you activate its 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:47.270
 my series will open normally because 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:49.640
 that with the accelerator but poor and 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:51.110
 very event series of hbo fact it 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.880
 full to do all that is sure the 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:54.950
 queens you can turn off a 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:56.990
 screenshot it's when you prepare the 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:58.430
 two buttons to take inscribed one 

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:59.990
 of your idevice but it will put it in 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:01.520
 normal mode maybe can disable 

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:04.010
 all that you will send a 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:05.780
 catering imessage or email to our 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:07.790
 friends who develops and accelerates it takes 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:09.620
 prove otherwise if all for the application 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:11.930
 would exceed for your idevice I lived 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:14.000
 that's minus 5.0 and even the poison 6 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:15.620
 more then for the application accesses 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.650
 happy and I will give total of 5 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:19.670
 stars 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.440
 so why five stars because 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:23.300
 personally it's the application the 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:25.070
 more complete compared to speed in 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:27.410
 facing the springtomize flyers which is 

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:29.630
 still possible complex this one we 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:31.459
 allows to disable the mode of 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:32.840
 acceleration in some animations 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:35.390
 so that's what I find very 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:37.970
 interesting to play tomorrow situation 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:39.440
 I had my music there then when 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:41.239
 the site was too long matisse to 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:43.310
 movies with animations sadi filet 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:44.180
 a lot too quickly and well thanks to 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:46.250
 him but I can turn it off 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:47.690
 now this little option there then 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:49.700
 this piece I loved it 5 stars you 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:52.040
 public field how many young people and said 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:53.360
 how much animation do you know how much more 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:54.709
 fingers she put you 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:56.150
 accelerated application in 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:58.010
 comments below on youtube 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:59.480
 only put your note in star and 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:02.480
 otherwise it's all for the application 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:04.160
 accelerate thanks so I hope you 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:05.600
 liked the video I also hope that 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:07.160
