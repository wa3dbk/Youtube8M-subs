hey guys dusty Escondida German got
another<00:00:04.830> weird<00:00:05.040> one<00:00:05.130> that<00:00:05.430> we<00:00:06.170> figured<00:00:07.170> out

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
another weird one that we figured out

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.290 
another weird one that we figured out
when<00:00:07.649> I<00:00:07.680> go<00:00:07.859> over<00:00:08.069> so<00:00:08.340> no<00:00:08.639> one<00:00:08.760> else<00:00:08.849> has<00:00:09.030> to<00:00:09.059> go

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
when I go over so no one else has to go

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.230 
when I go over so no one else has to go
through<00:00:09.480> the<00:00:09.599> same<00:00:09.780> issues<00:00:10.110> that<00:00:10.139> I<00:00:10.500> did<00:00:11.240> this

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
through the same issues that I did this

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.959 
through the same issues that I did this
car<00:00:12.450> came<00:00:12.690> in<00:00:12.900> with<00:00:13.110> the<00:00:13.200> complaint<00:00:13.790> did<00:00:14.790> not

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
idling and go to accelerate and I hit

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.830 
idling and go to accelerate and I hit
the<00:00:20.760> brakes<00:00:21.000> it<00:00:21.240> would<00:00:21.330> die<00:00:23.150> there<00:00:24.150> there<00:00:24.750> was

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
the brakes it would die there there was

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.720 
the brakes it would die there there was
another<00:00:25.080> thing<00:00:25.140> it<00:00:25.350> said<00:00:25.650> has<00:00:25.980> an<00:00:26.160> overly<00:00:26.519> rich

condition this black smoke up the

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.700 
condition this black smoke up the
tailpipe<00:00:32.750> when<00:00:33.750> we<00:00:33.840> first<00:00:34.079> pulled<00:00:34.260> the<00:00:34.350> car<00:00:34.530> in

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
tailpipe when we first pulled the car in

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.590 
tailpipe when we first pulled the car in
this<00:00:35.160> is<00:00:35.309> actually<00:00:35.640> sent<00:00:35.910> to<00:00:35.969> us<00:00:36.149> from<00:00:36.390> another

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
this is actually sent to us from another

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.990 
this is actually sent to us from another
shop<00:00:36.899> who<00:00:37.860> actually<00:00:38.129> took<00:00:38.399> it<00:00:38.460> on<00:00:38.670> from

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
shop who actually took it on from

shop who actually took it on from
another<00:00:39.840> shop<00:00:40.079> to<00:00:40.230> send<00:00:40.410> to<00:00:40.530> them<00:00:40.739> so<00:00:41.040> we're

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
another shop to send to them so we're

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.119 
another shop to send to them so we're
the<00:00:41.399> third<00:00:41.579> party<00:00:41.879> handler<00:00:42.270> on<00:00:42.300> this<00:00:42.540> car<00:00:43.129> so

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
the third party handler on this car so

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.850 
the third party handler on this car so
we<00:00:44.219> get<00:00:44.399> it<00:00:44.870> we<00:00:45.870> tested<00:00:46.079> things<00:00:46.350> we<00:00:46.590> found<00:00:46.800> a

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
we get it we tested things we found a

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.700 
we get it we tested things we found a
couple<00:00:46.980> things<00:00:47.250> that<00:00:47.399> were<00:00:47.780> were<00:00:48.780> incorrect

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
couple things that were were incorrect

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.310 
couple things that were were incorrect
none<00:00:50.190> that<00:00:50.489> actually<00:00:50.910> directly<00:00:51.809> affected<00:00:52.199> the

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
none that actually directly affected the

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.049 
none that actually directly affected the
big<00:00:52.530> issue<00:00:52.800> but<00:00:53.160> we're<00:00:53.399> issues<00:00:53.820> in<00:00:54.030> general

00:00:56.049 --> 00:00:56.059 
big issue but we're issues in general

00:00:56.059 --> 00:00:59.090 
big issue but we're issues in general
but<00:00:57.059> once<00:00:57.329> we<00:00:57.480> got<00:00:57.600> that<00:00:57.780> stuff<00:00:58.020> sort<00:00:58.260> kind<00:00:59.039> of

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
but once we got that stuff sort kind of

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.910 
but once we got that stuff sort kind of
got<00:00:59.250> gone<00:00:59.699> through<00:00:59.969> we<00:01:00.570> measured<00:01:01.410> the<00:01:01.590> co

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
got gone through we measured the co

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.189 
got gone through we measured the co
there<00:01:02.399> that<00:01:02.910> partially<00:01:03.329> burnt<00:01:03.539> fuel<00:01:03.809> coming

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
there that partially burnt fuel coming

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:05.840 
there that partially burnt fuel coming
out<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:04.409> tailpipe<00:01:04.619> and<00:01:04.979> an<00:01:05.129> idle<00:01:05.489> this<00:01:05.640> thing

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
out the tailpipe and an idle this thing

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.789 
out the tailpipe and an idle this thing
was<00:01:06.030> not<00:01:06.350> just<00:01:07.350> under<00:01:07.680> 10%<00:01:08.119> seal<00:01:09.119> which<00:01:09.600> is

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:09.799 
was not just under 10% seal which is

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:13.429 
was not just under 10% seal which is
extremely<00:01:10.799> rich<00:01:11.720> but<00:01:12.720> when<00:01:13.080> we<00:01:13.170> go<00:01:13.409> through

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
extremely rich but when we go through

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.350 
extremely rich but when we go through
and<00:01:13.890> hook<00:01:14.100> it<00:01:14.189> up<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:14.369> lab<00:01:14.549> scope<00:01:14.850> we<00:01:15.060> check

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
and hook it up the lab scope we check

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.140 
and hook it up the lab scope we check
the<00:01:15.950> milliseconds<00:01:16.950> which<00:01:17.430> these<00:01:17.580> injectors

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
the milliseconds which these injectors

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.020 
the milliseconds which these injectors
were<00:01:18.330> reading<00:01:18.869> at<00:01:19.020> they<00:01:19.979> obviously<00:01:20.670> you<00:01:20.939> can

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
were reading at they obviously you can

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.640 
were reading at they obviously you can
see<00:01:21.060> here<00:01:21.420> durational<00:01:21.900> injection<00:01:22.320> this<00:01:22.470> is

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
see here durational injection this is

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.890 
see here durational injection this is
according<00:01:23.009> to<00:01:23.189> the<00:01:23.400> computers<00:01:23.790> 2.76<00:01:24.630> we're

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
according to the computers 2.76 we're

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.630 
according to the computers 2.76 we're
reading<00:01:25.290> right<00:01:25.590> around<00:01:25.799> 3<00:01:26.250> which<00:01:27.150> is<00:01:27.330> normal

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:28.640 
reading right around 3 which is normal

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.429 
reading right around 3 which is normal
so<00:01:29.640> nobody<00:01:30.150> there<00:01:30.450> was<00:01:30.540> no<00:01:30.630> foul<00:01:30.840> play<00:01:30.869> here<00:01:31.290> no

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
so nobody there was no foul play here no

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.499 
so nobody there was no foul play here no
one<00:01:31.590> swapped<00:01:32.040> out<00:01:32.220> injectors<00:01:32.700> with<00:01:32.909> a<00:01:32.939> bigger

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
one swapped out injectors with a bigger

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:34.870 
one swapped out injectors with a bigger
style<00:01:33.869> or<00:01:34.079> anything<00:01:34.229> like<00:01:34.409> that<00:01:34.470> we

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880 
style or anything like that we

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:36.740 
style or anything like that we
cross-reference<00:01:35.880> apart<00:01:36.150> numbers<00:01:36.420> all<00:01:36.600> that

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
cross-reference apart numbers all that

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.399 
cross-reference apart numbers all that
good<00:01:36.869> stuff<00:01:37.579> but<00:01:38.579> we<00:01:38.729> did<00:01:38.909> notice<00:01:39.229> we<00:01:40.229> had

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
good stuff but we did notice we had

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:45.429 
good stuff but we did notice we had
another<00:01:40.619> 330<00:01:41.100> in<00:01:41.280> here<00:01:41.490> this<00:01:41.820> is<00:01:42.030> a<00:01:42.060> 2004<00:01:42.810> 330ci

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:45.439 
another 330 in here this is a 2004 330ci

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:48.080 
another 330 in here this is a 2004 330ci
we<00:01:46.439> were<00:01:47.009> looking<00:01:47.310> over<00:01:47.520> here<00:01:47.640> at<00:01:47.759> the<00:01:47.880> load

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
we were looking over here at the load

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.609 
we were looking over here at the load
signal<00:01:48.470> the<00:01:49.470> car<00:01:50.009> was<00:01:50.189> seeing<00:01:50.430> a<00:01:50.720> 38%<00:01:51.720> load<00:01:52.320> at

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
signal the car was seeing a 38% load at

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:56.749 
signal the car was seeing a 38% load at
idle<00:01:53.130> no<00:01:53.970> a/c<00:01:54.149> on<00:01:54.420> no<00:01:54.990> nothing<00:01:55.670> it<00:01:56.670> was

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
idle no a/c on no nothing it was

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.060 
idle no a/c on no nothing it was
actually<00:01:57.180> pulling<00:01:57.750> out<00:01:57.840> timing<00:01:58.350> as<00:01:58.469> well<00:01:58.710> you

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
actually pulling out timing as well you

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.620 
actually pulling out timing as well you
can<00:01:59.219> see<00:01:59.430> that<00:01:59.670> it<00:01:59.850> was<00:01:59.939> retarding<00:02:00.420> crank

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
can see that it was retarding crank

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.670 
can see that it was retarding crank
crank<00:02:01.140> timing<00:02:03.140> whatever<00:02:04.140> reason<00:02:04.500> maybe

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
crank timing whatever reason maybe

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.039 
crank timing whatever reason maybe
because<00:02:04.799> the<00:02:05.490> excessive<00:02:06.210> load<00:02:06.420> is<00:02:06.630> pulling

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
because the excessive load is pulling

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:10.790 
because the excessive load is pulling
timing<00:02:07.439> out<00:02:07.530> to<00:02:07.710> compensate<00:02:09.170> also<00:02:10.170> we<00:02:10.379> noticed

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
timing out to compensate also we noticed

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.610 
timing out to compensate also we noticed
we<00:02:11.760> took<00:02:11.910> a<00:02:11.970> couple<00:02:12.209> freeze-frame<00:02:12.720> pictures

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
we took a couple freeze-frame pictures

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.119 
we took a couple freeze-frame pictures
of<00:02:13.860> a<00:02:14.069> no-good<00:02:14.610> car<00:02:14.879> and<00:02:15.920> this<00:02:16.920> is<00:02:17.099> a

everything<00:03:01.680> checked<00:03:02.010> out<00:03:02.129> fine<00:03:02.430> there's

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
everything checked out fine there's

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:04.130 
everything checked out fine there's
couple<00:03:03.000> little<00:03:03.120> things<00:03:03.390> that<00:03:03.480> like<00:03:03.720> I<00:03:03.810> said<00:03:03.989> we

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
couple little things that like I said we

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.710 
couple little things that like I said we
rectified<00:03:04.860> it<00:03:05.160> weren't<00:03:05.400> 100<00:03:05.760> percent<00:03:06.060> just<00:03:06.599> to

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
rectified it weren't 100 percent just to

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.650 
rectified it weren't 100 percent just to
make<00:03:06.900> sure<00:03:06.930> we<00:03:07.140> were<00:03:07.260> covering<00:03:07.530> our<00:03:07.650> bases<00:03:08.660> but

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
make sure we were covering our bases but

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:11.119 
make sure we were covering our bases but
we<00:03:09.870> ended<00:03:10.140> up<00:03:10.230> pulling<00:03:10.500> the<00:03:10.650> throttle<00:03:11.040> body

00:03:11.119 --> 00:03:11.129 
we ended up pulling the throttle body

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:13.009 
we ended up pulling the throttle body
making<00:03:11.459> sure<00:03:11.670> there<00:03:11.819> was<00:03:11.910> no<00:03:12.120> restrictions<00:03:12.840> in

00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:13.019 
making sure there was no restrictions in

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:17.180 
making sure there was no restrictions in
there<00:03:13.519> pull<00:03:14.519> the<00:03:15.470> intake<00:03:16.470> flap<00:03:16.739> out<00:03:16.920> of<00:03:17.069> it

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
there pull the intake flap out of it

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:19.400 
there pull the intake flap out of it
just<00:03:17.340> to<00:03:17.430> make<00:03:17.549> sure<00:03:17.730> that<00:03:17.850> that<00:03:18.000> was<00:03:18.410> working

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.410 
just to make sure that that was working

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:20.930 
just to make sure that that was working
there<00:03:19.650> was<00:03:19.769> no<00:03:19.889> obstructions<00:03:20.400> in<00:03:20.519> there<00:03:20.700> and

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
there was no obstructions in there and

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:23.690 
there was no obstructions in there and
in<00:03:21.720> the<00:03:21.870> interim<00:03:22.260> just<00:03:22.980> to<00:03:23.100> make<00:03:23.250> sure<00:03:23.280> we

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
in the interim just to make sure we

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.390 
in the interim just to make sure we
pulled<00:03:23.970> the<00:03:24.299> idle<00:03:24.840> air<00:03:24.959> control<00:03:24.989> valve<00:03:25.290> of<00:03:26.100> the

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
pulled the idle air control valve of the

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.199 
pulled the idle air control valve of the
car<00:03:26.609> and<00:03:26.930> what<00:03:27.930> we<00:03:28.049> found<00:03:28.700> is<00:03:29.700> I<00:03:29.849> stuck<00:03:30.090> my

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:30.209 
car and what we found is I stuck my

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:31.610 
car and what we found is I stuck my
finger<00:03:30.239> down<00:03:30.630> in<00:03:30.690> the<00:03:30.840> hole<00:03:31.079> where<00:03:31.290> actually

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
finger down in the hole where actually

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.610 
finger down in the hole where actually
goes<00:03:31.829> to<00:03:31.980> the<00:03:32.130> intake<00:03:32.549> channel<00:03:32.790> and<00:03:33.410> it<00:03:34.410> had

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
goes to the intake channel and it had

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:37.220 
goes to the intake channel and it had
like<00:03:35.340> almost<00:03:35.609> like<00:03:35.730> a<00:03:35.790> fine<00:03:36.420> graphite<00:03:36.959> powder

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
like almost like a fine graphite powder

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:40.460 
like almost like a fine graphite powder
in<00:03:37.590> it<00:03:37.620> and<00:03:38.120> when<00:03:39.120> I<00:03:39.150> looked<00:03:39.480> in<00:03:39.630> inside<00:03:40.170> for

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
in it and when I looked in inside for

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:43.400 
in it and when I looked in inside for
the<00:03:40.760> actual<00:03:41.760> motor<00:03:42.030> and<00:03:42.329> physically<00:03:43.049> moved<00:03:43.260> it

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:43.410 
the actual motor and physically moved it

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:45.949 
the actual motor and physically moved it

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:52.309 
frozen on the way the BMW's work is they
don't<00:03:49.590> have<00:03:49.769> a<00:03:50.160> way<00:03:50.700> of<00:03:51.090> like<00:03:51.959> a<00:03:51.989> position

why<00:04:14.459> we're<00:04:14.639> getting<00:04:14.760> air<00:04:15.030> mass<00:04:15.239> codes<00:04:16.729> so<00:04:18.049> this

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:19.049 
why we're getting air mass codes so this

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:20.569 
why we're getting air mass codes so this
is<00:04:19.200> one<00:04:19.470> thing<00:04:19.590> you<00:04:19.709> want<00:04:19.889> to<00:04:19.950> check<00:04:20.130> make<00:04:20.459> sure

00:04:20.569 --> 00:04:20.579 
is one thing you want to check make sure

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:22.899 
is one thing you want to check make sure
it<00:04:20.880> moves<00:04:21.000> freely<00:04:21.380> you<00:04:22.380> should<00:04:22.590> be<00:04:22.650> able<00:04:22.710> to

00:04:22.899 --> 00:04:22.909 
it moves freely you should be able to

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:25.279 
it moves freely you should be able to
turn<00:04:23.909> back<00:04:23.940> and<00:04:24.120> forth<00:04:24.419> and<00:04:24.539> hear<00:04:24.750> the<00:04:25.050> little

00:04:25.279 --> 00:04:25.289 
turn back and forth and hear the little

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:26.910 
turn back and forth and hear the little
valve<00:04:25.469> slam<00:04:26.159> from

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:26.920 
valve slam from

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:30.570 
valve slam from
stop<00:04:27.160> the<00:04:27.310> end<00:04:27.400> stop<00:04:28.350> so<00:04:29.350> it<00:04:29.710> was<00:04:29.830> it<00:04:30.520> was

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:30.580 
stop the end stop so it was it was

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:32.250 
stop the end stop so it was it was
calculating<00:04:31.300> that<00:04:31.420> this<00:04:31.600> thing<00:04:31.750> was<00:04:31.870> opening

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:32.260 
calculating that this thing was opening

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.800 
calculating that this thing was opening
and<00:04:32.410> adding<00:04:32.770> enough<00:04:33.040> fuel<00:04:33.280> to<00:04:33.400> to<00:04:34.240> compensate

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:34.810 
and adding enough fuel to to compensate

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:36.030 
and adding enough fuel to to compensate
for<00:04:34.960> that<00:04:35.020> and<00:04:35.140> that's<00:04:35.440> why<00:04:35.560> we<00:04:35.590> were<00:04:35.830> seeing

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:36.040 
for that and that's why we were seeing

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:39.660 
for that and that's why we were seeing
an<00:04:36.130> overly<00:04:36.520> rich<00:04:36.730> condition<00:04:38.280> the<00:04:39.280> computer

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:39.670 
an overly rich condition the computer

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:41.880 
an overly rich condition the computer
was<00:04:39.790> just<00:04:39.940> trying<00:04:40.120> to<00:04:40.210> do<00:04:40.270> its<00:04:40.420> job<00:04:40.690> and<00:04:40.900> what

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:41.890 
was just trying to do its job and what

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:44.250 
was just trying to do its job and what
was<00:04:42.040> funny<00:04:42.220> is<00:04:42.370> that<00:04:42.870> we<00:04:43.870> had<00:04:43.960> pulled<00:04:44.170> the

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:44.260 
was funny is that we had pulled the

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:45.990 
was funny is that we had pulled the
brake<00:04:44.500> booster<00:04:44.710> hose<00:04:45.040> off<00:04:45.340> and<00:04:45.610> the<00:04:45.820> thing

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:46.000 
brake booster hose off and the thing

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.640 
brake booster hose off and the thing
would<00:04:46.150> run<00:04:46.510> an<00:04:46.660> idle<00:04:46.960> and<00:04:47.140> we<00:04:47.200> could<00:04:47.350> plug<00:04:47.500> it

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:47.650 
would run an idle and we could plug it

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:50.490 
would run an idle and we could plug it
back<00:04:47.680> in<00:04:47.980> and<00:04:48.960> majority<00:04:49.960> of<00:04:50.050> these<00:04:50.140> numbers

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:50.500 
back in and majority of these numbers

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:52.890 
back in and majority of these numbers
when<00:04:50.890> I<00:04:50.950> was<00:04:51.100> warmed<00:04:51.430> up<00:04:51.580> would<00:04:52.390> go<00:04:52.570> back<00:04:52.750> to

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:52.900 
when I was warmed up would go back to

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:56.210 
when I was warmed up would go back to
normal<00:04:53.260> until<00:04:53.670> you<00:04:54.670> hit<00:04:54.820> the<00:04:54.880> accelerator

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:56.220 
normal until you hit the accelerator

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:59.250 
normal until you hit the accelerator
then<00:04:57.220> it<00:04:57.340> would<00:04:57.460> go<00:04:57.580> back<00:04:57.790> into<00:04:58.030> two<00:04:58.600> high

00:04:59.250 --> 00:04:59.260 
then it would go back into two high

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:02.190 
then it would go back into two high
loaded<00:04:59.740> condition<00:05:00.570> rich<00:05:01.570> condition<00:05:01.840> out<00:05:02.110> the
