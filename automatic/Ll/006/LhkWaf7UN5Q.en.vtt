00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:20.410
 but from the dance of supplication 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:24.130
 We can see 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:28.110
 we already have many pets tell me one then 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:28.110
 we have ready the pap 

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:35.110
 one that is mine 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:37.660
 you very well thought of a hamster 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:41.500
 worsened or maybe one of those cute and 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:44.220
 virtual pets clean dolphins 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.220
 presentable 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:53.040
 where did you get dolphins and who 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:55.260
 is in the aquarium you like such a barbie 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:57.090
 Once you can improve it even more and put a 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.760
 reef and an algae forest awaits 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:02.460
 I can fix it in the aquarium is very 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.949
 ok but if we can not stay with 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.910
 three dolphins look at their eyes and tell me 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.910
 can you refuse 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.620
 maybe accidentally connect the 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:21.200
 aquarium to the hand pipe 

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:21.200
 what's the neighborhood and we're going 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.719
 we must follow his trail 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.920
 it must be a bigger artifact 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.260
 to home 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:46.970
 if I carry my sponge 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:53.900
 If I had hurt that, it was not a 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.900
 dolphin that was 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.450
 something inside 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.530
 or something 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.750
 the tower 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:12.190
 there is something with the dolphins have eyes 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:14.440
 lifeless black eyes like doll eyes 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:16.680
 and then those black eyes are put on 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:19.540
 white color and then you hear it scream 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:21.110
 terribly 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.570
 higher 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:26.150
 this banyeres for girls not for noses 

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:28.450
 of good bottle if you come back give us a 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.450
 scream 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:34.360
 and ate all my special tuna sushi 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:37.640
 but for me and for the girls that 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:41.270
 share wasabi bryant 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:44.140
 and that's just we need to bring them from 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:44.140
 return to the aquarium 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:55.080
 and maybe you want to think better about the 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:55.080
 dolphins 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:01.150
 they are very mature on your part to leave them 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:02.980
 return to the ocean thanks skippers and 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:04.690
 who discovered a way to connect 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:07.470
 the aquarium to the ocean so they can 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:07.470
 return when you want 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:12.010
 of your cream
