stats<00:00:20.939> and<00:00:21.330> compiled<00:00:21.720> them<00:00:21.900> into<00:00:22.080> a<00:00:22.109> little

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
stats and compiled them into a little

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.109 
stats and compiled them into a little
infographic<00:00:23.070> so<00:00:23.250> if<00:00:23.310> we<00:00:23.400> pull<00:00:23.609> this<00:00:23.730> guy<00:00:23.910> down

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
infographic so if we pull this guy down

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:25.519 
infographic so if we pull this guy down
you'll<00:00:24.570> notice<00:00:24.869> that<00:00:24.960> I<00:00:25.019> took<00:00:25.109> note<00:00:25.380> of<00:00:25.410> the

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
you'll notice that I took note of the

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.460 
you'll notice that I took note of the
scg's<00:00:26.250> reload<00:00:26.699> time<00:00:26.910> movement<00:00:27.779> speed<00:00:28.050> the

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
scg's reload time movement speed the

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.250 
scg's reload time movement speed the
rate<00:00:28.619> of<00:00:28.769> fire<00:00:28.949> ammo<00:00:29.640> capacity<00:00:29.789> and<00:00:30.390> damage<00:00:31.019> so

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
rate of fire ammo capacity and damage so

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.290 
rate of fire ammo capacity and damage so
let's<00:00:31.560> begin<00:00:31.800> we'll<00:00:32.700> start<00:00:33.030> off<00:00:33.120> by

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
let's begin we'll start off by

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.360 
let's begin we'll start off by
discussing<00:00:33.630> the<00:00:33.840> scg's<00:00:34.500> reload<00:00:34.950> time<00:00:35.160> and

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
discussing the scg's reload time and

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.549 
discussing the scg's reload time and
it'll<00:00:35.610> reload<00:00:36.030> in<00:00:36.239> about<00:00:36.480> three<00:00:36.780> seconds<00:00:37.320> and

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
it'll reload in about three seconds and

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.380 
it'll reload in about three seconds and
this<00:00:38.129> is<00:00:38.309> pretty<00:00:38.520> good<00:00:38.730> when<00:00:38.940> you<00:00:39.090> consider

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
this is pretty good when you consider

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.270 
this is pretty good when you consider
how<00:00:39.629> big<00:00:39.870> of<00:00:39.899> a<00:00:40.050> magazine<00:00:40.290> you<00:00:40.559> have<00:00:40.950> so<00:00:41.219> you

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
how big of a magazine you have so you

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.250 
how big of a magazine you have so you
can<00:00:41.399> hold<00:00:41.730> about<00:00:41.850> sixty<00:00:42.300> rounds<00:00:42.480> and<00:00:42.809> this<00:00:43.079> is

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
can hold about sixty rounds and this is

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.350 
can hold about sixty rounds and this is
actually<00:00:43.890> what<00:00:44.309> I<00:00:44.340> believed<00:00:44.700> to<00:00:44.789> be<00:00:44.879> best<00:00:45.180> in

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
actually what I believed to be best in

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.240 
actually what I believed to be best in
class<00:00:45.390> for<00:00:45.840> an<00:00:45.930> assault<00:00:46.170> rifle<00:00:46.289> and<00:00:46.829> if<00:00:47.160> you

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
class for an assault rifle and if you

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.100 
class for an assault rifle and if you
can<00:00:47.430> spray<00:00:47.640> sixty<00:00:48.120> rounds<00:00:48.329> of<00:00:48.570> lead<00:00:48.750> into<00:00:49.079> a

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
can spray sixty rounds of lead into a

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.319 
can spray sixty rounds of lead into a
zombie<00:00:49.350> and<00:00:49.620> only<00:00:49.860> have<00:00:50.039> to<00:00:50.160> reload<00:00:50.640> in<00:00:50.879> three

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
zombie and only have to reload in three

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.119 
zombie and only have to reload in three
seconds<00:00:51.780> that's<00:00:52.199> pretty<00:00:52.469> good<00:00:52.680> and<00:00:52.860> of<00:00:52.920> course

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
seconds that's pretty good and of course

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:54.709 
seconds that's pretty good and of course
you<00:00:53.219> can<00:00:53.340> always<00:00:53.460> cut<00:00:53.760> that<00:00:53.910> time<00:00:54.120> down<00:00:54.180> with

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
you can always cut that time down with

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.139 
you can always cut that time down with
speed<00:00:54.960> Cola<00:00:55.410> if<00:00:55.680> you<00:00:55.890> want<00:00:56.160> and<00:00:56.309> so<00:00:56.430> overall<00:00:56.820> I

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
speed Cola if you want and so overall I

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.180 
speed Cola if you want and so overall I
would<00:00:57.390> have<00:00:57.629> to<00:00:57.750> give<00:00:57.899> the<00:00:58.050> scg's<00:00:58.620> reload<00:00:58.980> time

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
would have to give the scg's reload time

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.549 
would have to give the scg's reload time
an<00:00:59.280> eight<00:00:59.460> plus<00:00:59.730> moving<00:01:00.539> on<00:01:00.809> to<00:01:00.989> your<00:01:01.079> movement

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
an eight plus moving on to your movement

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:02.810 
an eight plus moving on to your movement
speed<00:01:01.590> you're<00:01:01.920> gonna<00:01:02.010> move<00:01:02.160> at<00:01:02.340> about<00:01:02.520> ninety

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
speed you're gonna move at about ninety

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.910 
speed you're gonna move at about ninety
percent<00:01:03.000> of<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:03.510> normal<00:01:03.660> movement<00:01:04.110> speed<00:01:04.530> and

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
percent of the normal movement speed and

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.260 
percent of the normal movement speed and
just<00:01:05.159> to<00:01:05.250> give<00:01:05.400> you<00:01:05.489> guys<00:01:05.640> some<00:01:05.880> reference

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
really that big of a difference you can

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.960 
really that big of a difference you can
still<00:01:18.990> train<00:01:19.259> with<00:01:19.439> the<00:01:19.560> scg<00:01:20.130> in<00:01:20.310> tight<00:01:20.610> places

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
still train with the scg in tight places

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.450 
still train with the scg in tight places
although<00:01:21.540> I<00:01:21.570> must<00:01:21.930> say<00:01:22.049> you<00:01:22.619> will<00:01:22.860> not<00:01:23.040> be<00:01:23.280> able

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:30.620 
at a horde of zombies keep in mind that
you're<00:01:29.820> not<00:01:29.850> gonna<00:01:30.060> be<00:01:30.150> able<00:01:30.270> to<00:01:30.360> do<00:01:30.479> that

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
you're not gonna be able to do that

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:31.940 
you're not gonna be able to do that
forever<00:01:30.780> because<00:01:31.200> eventually<00:01:31.530> they're<00:01:31.799> gonna

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
forever because eventually they're gonna

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.560 
forever because eventually they're gonna
catch<00:01:32.220> up<00:01:32.430> to<00:01:32.460> you<00:01:32.610> as<00:01:33.000> opposed<00:01:33.329> to<00:01:33.390> doing

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
catch up to you as opposed to doing

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.569 
catch up to you as opposed to doing
global<00:01:33.869> with<00:01:33.960> a<00:01:33.990> weapon<00:01:34.290> like<00:01:34.320> the<00:01:34.530> PDW<00:01:35.130> you

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
global with a weapon like the PDW you

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:36.950 
global with a weapon like the PDW you
could<00:01:35.729> actually<00:01:36.000> spray<00:01:36.210> down<00:01:36.390> sights<00:01:36.750> and

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
could actually spray down sights and

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.810 
could actually spray down sights and
move<00:01:37.350> and<00:01:37.650> the<00:01:37.770> zombies<00:01:38.070> will<00:01:38.250> not<00:01:38.400> catch<00:01:38.610> up

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
move and the zombies will not catch up

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.550 
move and the zombies will not catch up
to<00:01:38.939> you<00:01:39.090> the<00:01:39.450> next<00:01:39.689> item<00:01:39.930> I<00:01:40.020> have<00:01:40.049> on<00:01:40.409> my

to you the next item I have on my

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.950 
to you the next item I have on my
infographic<00:01:41.400> is<00:01:41.549> the<00:01:41.790> way<00:01:41.970> to<00:01:42.030> fire<00:01:42.299> the<00:01:42.479> SC<00:01:42.810> G

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
infographic is the way to fire the SC G

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.600 
infographic is the way to fire the SC G
and<00:01:43.110> the<00:01:43.170> SC<00:01:43.470> G<00:01:43.619> will<00:01:43.770> fire<00:01:43.950> in<00:01:44.130> about<00:01:44.310> 700

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
and the SC G will fire in about 700

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.179 
and the SC G will fire in about 700
rounds<00:01:45.049> 720<00:01:46.049> rounds<00:01:46.320> per<00:01:46.439> minute<00:01:46.560> and<00:01:46.860> this<00:01:46.979> is

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
rounds 720 rounds per minute and this is

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:48.770 
rounds 720 rounds per minute and this is
actually<00:01:47.549> only<00:01:47.759> high-end<00:01:48.090> for<00:01:48.509> an<00:01:48.600> assault

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
actually only high-end for an assault

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.420 
actually only high-end for an assault
rifle<00:01:48.899> well<00:01:49.560> it<00:01:49.710> may<00:01:49.799> not<00:01:49.829> look<00:01:50.159> like<00:01:50.220> much

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
rifle well it may not look like much

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.039 
rifle well it may not look like much
that's<00:01:51.060> pretty<00:01:51.299> good<00:01:51.450> especially<00:01:51.869> when<00:01:51.990> you

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
that's pretty good especially when you

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:53.840 
that's pretty good especially when you
consider<00:01:52.170> that<00:01:52.500> you<00:01:52.649> have<00:01:52.680> 60<00:01:53.369> rounds<00:01:53.610> that

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
consider that you have 60 rounds that

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.460 
consider that you have 60 rounds that
you<00:01:53.939> can<00:01:54.090> fire<00:01:54.299> towards<00:01:54.689> these<00:01:54.869> zombies<00:01:55.320> and

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
you can fire towards these zombies and

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:56.719 
you can fire towards these zombies and
of<00:01:55.680> course<00:01:55.890> you<00:01:56.009> can<00:01:56.130> always<00:01:56.280> speed<00:01:56.549> this

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
of course you can always speed this

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.789 
of course you can always speed this
number<00:01:57.030> up<00:01:57.210> with<00:01:57.450> double<00:01:57.750> tap<00:01:57.930> so<00:01:58.110> overall<00:01:58.590> I

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
number up with double tap so overall I

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.039 
number up with double tap so overall I
would<00:01:59.070> have<00:01:59.340> to<00:01:59.520> give<00:01:59.759> the<00:02:00.060> scg's<00:02:00.689> rate<00:02:00.930> of

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
would have to give the scg's rate of

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:02.990 
would have to give the scg's rate of
fire<00:02:01.200> a<00:02:01.229> thumbs<00:02:01.590> up<00:02:01.890> following<00:02:02.610> the<00:02:02.700> right<00:02:02.909> of

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
fire a thumbs up following the right of

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.420 
fire a thumbs up following the right of
fire<00:02:03.149> I<00:02:03.240> have<00:02:03.479> the<00:02:03.719> ammo<00:02:03.930> capacity<00:02:04.170> and<00:02:04.860> the<00:02:05.040> SC

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
fire I have the ammo capacity and the SC

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.150 
fire I have the ammo capacity and the SC
G<00:02:05.700> will<00:02:05.939> hold<00:02:06.149> about<00:02:06.240> 390<00:02:07.170> rounds<00:02:07.500> and<00:02:07.649> this<00:02:07.890> is

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
G will hold about 390 rounds and this is

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.100 
G will hold about 390 rounds and this is
also<00:02:08.640> pretty<00:02:08.849> good<00:02:08.940> I<00:02:09.270> feel<00:02:09.690> like<00:02:09.840> you<00:02:09.929> have<00:02:10.080> a
