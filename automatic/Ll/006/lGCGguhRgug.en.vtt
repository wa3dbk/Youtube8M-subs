00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
yeah it's more unboxing ran and there's

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:10.910 
yeah it's more unboxing ran and there's
not<00:00:09.420> a<00:00:09.450> whole<00:00:09.690> lot<00:00:09.719> to<00:00:09.900> talk<00:00:10.170> about<00:00:10.320> about<00:00:10.620> RAM

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
not a whole lot to talk about about RAM

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.530 
not a whole lot to talk about about RAM
but<00:00:11.219> what<00:00:11.700> I<00:00:11.759> want<00:00:11.940> you<00:00:12.000> to<00:00:12.090> note<00:00:12.210> about<00:00:12.330> this

but what I want you to note about this
packaging<00:00:13.080> is<00:00:13.170> that<00:00:13.349> they've<00:00:13.500> gone<00:00:13.710> and

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
packaging is that they've gone and

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.820 
packaging is that they've gone and
they've<00:00:14.280> colored<00:00:14.969> it<00:00:15.089> green<00:00:15.780> now<00:00:16.320> Green<00:00:16.619> is<00:00:16.800> a

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
they've colored it green now Green is a

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.230 
they've colored it green now Green is a
common<00:00:17.279> theme<00:00:17.460> out<00:00:17.670> there<00:00:17.880> right<00:00:18.060> now<00:00:18.210> for

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
common theme out there right now for

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.970 
common theme out there right now for
computer<00:00:18.779> parts<00:00:19.050> people<00:00:19.260> are<00:00:19.470> bringing<00:00:19.800> down

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
computer parts people are bringing down

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.910 
computer parts people are bringing down
people<00:00:20.880> are<00:00:21.000> demanding<00:00:21.300> parts<00:00:22.109> with<00:00:22.350> lower

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
people are demanding parts with lower

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.120 
people are demanding parts with lower
power<00:00:23.220> consumption<00:00:23.760> while<00:00:24.570> still<00:00:25.170> demanding

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
power consumption while still demanding

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.000 
power consumption while still demanding
higher<00:00:26.430> performance<00:00:27.240> in<00:00:27.449> general<00:00:27.930> so<00:00:28.170> the<00:00:28.650> Eco

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
higher performance in general so the Eco

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.859 
higher performance in general so the Eco
kit<00:00:29.250> that<00:00:29.429> we're<00:00:29.580> looking<00:00:29.849> at<00:00:30.000> today<00:00:30.300> what

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
kit that we're looking at today what

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.740 
kit that we're looking at today what
makes<00:00:31.170> this<00:00:31.439> kit<00:00:31.769> green<00:00:32.189> is<00:00:32.520> the<00:00:33.090> fact<00:00:33.329> that<00:00:33.510> it

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
makes this kit green is the fact that it

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.310 
makes this kit green is the fact that it
actually<00:00:34.290> uses<00:00:34.559> very<00:00:35.520> very<00:00:36.059> low<00:00:36.450> voltages<00:00:37.079> to

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
actually uses very very low voltages to

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.220 
actually uses very very low voltages to
achieve<00:00:37.950> its<00:00:38.160> operating<00:00:38.670> speed<00:00:39.050> so<00:00:40.050> this

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
achieve its operating speed so this

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:41.720 
achieve its operating speed so this
particular<00:00:40.739> kit<00:00:40.920> that<00:00:41.070> I'm<00:00:41.160> looking<00:00:41.430> at<00:00:41.550> right

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
particular kit that I'm looking at right

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.900 
particular kit that I'm looking at right
here<00:00:41.790> is<00:00:42.239> actually<00:00:42.690> a<00:00:42.960> ddr3<00:00:43.649> 1600<00:00:44.309> megahertz

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
here is actually a ddr3 1600 megahertz

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.119 
here is actually a ddr3 1600 megahertz
kit<00:00:45.360> so<00:00:45.570> it's<00:00:45.719> a<00:00:45.809> reasonable<00:00:46.260> speed<00:00:46.379> cast

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
kit so it's a reasonable speed cast

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.430 
kit so it's a reasonable speed cast
latency<00:00:47.670> of<00:00:47.789> seven<00:00:48.180> that's<00:00:48.570> fairly<00:00:49.020> good<00:00:49.289> as

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
latency of seven that's fairly good as

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.040 
latency of seven that's fairly good as
well<00:00:49.649> but<00:00:50.460> what's<00:00:50.940> really<00:00:51.180> exceptional<00:00:51.870> about

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
well but what's really exceptional about

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.810 
well but what's really exceptional about
it<00:00:52.170> is<00:00:52.260> it<00:00:52.379> runs<00:00:52.559> at<00:00:52.680> one<00:00:52.920> point<00:00:53.190> three<00:00:53.579> five

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
it is it runs at one point three five

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.720 
it is it runs at one point three five
bolts<00:00:54.239> even<00:00:55.079> a<00:00:55.170> few<00:00:55.350> months<00:00:55.680> ago<00:00:55.800> a<00:00:56.190> stick<00:00:56.699> like

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
bolts even a few months ago a stick like

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.150 
bolts even a few months ago a stick like
this<00:00:57.149> would<00:00:57.600> have<00:00:57.719> definitely<00:00:58.320> been<00:00:58.770> running

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
this would have definitely been running

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.369 
this would have definitely been running
at<00:00:59.250> one<00:00:59.399> point<00:00:59.579> six<00:00:59.879> five<00:01:00.090> because<00:01:00.899> the

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
at one point six five because the

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.470 
at one point six five because the
bidding<00:01:01.770> just<00:01:01.949> wasn't<00:01:02.460> that<00:01:02.640> good<00:01:02.969> yet<00:01:03.239> for

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
bidding just wasn't that good yet for

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.270 
bidding just wasn't that good yet for
ddr3<00:01:03.840> modules<00:01:04.470> now<00:01:04.619> you<00:01:04.680> can<00:01:04.890> have<00:01:04.979> a<00:01:05.040> look<00:01:05.189> at

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
ddr3 modules now you can have a look at

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.250 
ddr3 modules now you can have a look at
the<00:01:05.369> heat<00:01:05.549> spreader<00:01:05.850> here<00:01:06.119> it's<00:01:06.600> a<00:01:06.750> fairly<00:01:06.990> bog

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
the heat spreader here it's a fairly bog

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:08.660

00:01:11.109 --> 00:01:11.119 
g.skill logo here you got kind of a cool

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:14.780 
g.skill logo here you got kind of a cool
you<00:01:12.119> know<00:01:12.240> blady<00:01:12.659> wavy<00:01:13.380> sort<00:01:13.680> of<00:01:13.830> design<00:01:14.250> the

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
you know blady wavy sort of design the

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.880 
you know blady wavy sort of design the
top<00:01:15.000> has<00:01:15.240> little<00:01:15.630> ventilation<00:01:16.229> holes<00:01:16.500> you<00:01:16.740> can

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
top has little ventilation holes you can

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.950 
top has little ventilation holes you can
see<00:01:17.100> our<00:01:17.220> oh<00:01:17.430> yeah<00:01:18.119> no<00:01:18.270> it's<00:01:18.420> applied<00:01:18.689> properly

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
see our oh yeah no it's applied properly

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.140 
see our oh yeah no it's applied properly
yeah<00:01:19.350> it<00:01:19.770> just<00:01:20.009> hooks<00:01:20.159> in<00:01:20.430> at<00:01:20.580> either<00:01:20.700> end<00:01:21.000> and

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
yeah it just hooks in at either end and

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.609 
yeah it just hooks in at either end and
then<00:01:21.299> there's<00:01:21.450> little<00:01:21.600> holes<00:01:21.900> so<00:01:22.080> it's<00:01:22.350> a<00:01:22.439> dual

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
then there's little holes so it's a dual

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.010 
then there's little holes so it's a dual
channel<00:01:22.650> kit<00:01:23.420> that<00:01:24.420> means<00:01:24.630> that<00:01:24.810> it<00:01:24.900> is

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
channel kit that means that it is
