00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
with two scars first of all I have this

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.180 
with two scars first of all I have this
one<00:00:15.780> that<00:00:15.929> I<00:00:15.990> got<00:00:16.139> from<00:00:16.350> eBay<00:00:16.560> I<00:00:16.740> thought<00:00:17.100> it

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
one that I got from eBay I thought it

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:18.470 
one that I got from eBay I thought it
was<00:00:17.279> going<00:00:17.400> to<00:00:17.490> be<00:00:17.640> large<00:00:17.880> enough<00:00:17.940> for<00:00:18.240> my

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
was going to be large enough for my

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.200 
was going to be large enough for my
whole<00:00:18.660> head<00:00:18.900> but<00:00:19.529> I<00:00:19.859> didn't<00:00:20.730> really<00:00:20.939> check<00:00:21.090> out

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
whole head but I didn't really check out

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.090 
whole head but I didn't really check out
the<00:00:21.359> dimensions<00:00:21.930> and<00:00:22.170> it's<00:00:22.380> quite<00:00:22.650> small<00:00:23.070> for

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
the dimensions and it's quite small for

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.570 
the dimensions and it's quite small for
me<00:00:23.400> so<00:00:23.939> I<00:00:24.240> still<00:00:24.570> use<00:00:24.810> it<00:00:24.840> it's<00:00:25.289> not<00:00:25.920> soap<00:00:26.279> but

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
me so I still use it it's not soap but

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.359 
me so I still use it it's not soap but
it's<00:00:26.789> like<00:00:27.000> a<00:00:27.029> satin<00:00:27.750> material<00:00:27.810> kind<00:00:28.410> of<00:00:28.590> so<00:00:29.310> I

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
it's like a satin material kind of so I

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:34.459 
it's like a satin material kind of so I
roll<00:00:29.760> it<00:00:29.970> like<00:00:30.980> this<00:00:31.980> and<00:00:32.360> I'll<00:00:33.410> brush<00:00:34.410> my

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
roll it like this and I'll brush my

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.250 
roll it like this and I'll brush my
edges<00:00:34.980> down<00:00:35.160> very<00:00:35.579> smooth<00:00:35.969> I'll<00:00:36.540> apply<00:00:37.200> it

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
edges down very smooth I'll apply it

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:47.880 
edges down very smooth I'll apply it
like<00:00:37.500> this<00:00:38.030> tie<00:00:39.030> it<00:00:39.090> in<00:00:39.270> the<00:00:39.329> back

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:47.890 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:50.250 

now<00:00:48.700> I'll<00:00:48.880> tie<00:00:49.120> it's<00:00:49.300> higher<00:00:49.510> than<00:00:49.540> that<00:00:50.020> but

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:50.260 
now I'll tie it's higher than that but

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.710 
now I'll tie it's higher than that but
this<00:00:50.470> is<00:00:50.680> how<00:00:51.040> it<00:00:51.220> would<00:00:51.370> look<00:00:51.400> so<00:00:52.300> I<00:00:52.390> have<00:00:52.600> the

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:55.780

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
that's not a problem for me maybe if

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:50.170 
that's not a problem for me maybe if
your<00:01:49.040> head<00:01:49.220> slits<00:01:49.460> at<00:01:49.580> night<00:01:49.760> maybe<00:01:49.970> this

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:50.180 
your head slits at night maybe this

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.000 
your head slits at night maybe this
might<00:01:50.360> be<00:01:50.510> also<00:01:50.870> good<00:01:51.230> alternative<00:01:51.770> for<00:01:51.890> you

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:52.010 
might be also good alternative for you

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:54.400 
might be also good alternative for you
because<00:01:52.430> there's<00:01:53.150> some<00:01:53.450> space<00:01:53.750> open<00:01:54.200> your

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:54.410 
because there's some space open your

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:55.870 
because there's some space open your
head<00:01:54.500> is<00:01:54.620> not<00:01:54.770> completely<00:01:55.160> concealed<00:01:55.610> within

check on here that has been flat so I

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.240 
check on here that has been flat so I
got<00:02:26.930> that<00:02:27.110> this<00:02:27.230> is<00:02:27.380> how<00:02:27.530> I<00:02:27.560> felt<00:02:27.860> with<00:02:27.920> my<00:02:28.070> hair

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
got that this is how I felt with my hair

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:35.020 
got that this is how I felt with my hair
last<00:02:28.459> night<00:02:29.410> and<00:02:30.550> this<00:02:31.550> one<00:02:33.640> and<00:02:34.640> just<00:02:34.880> gently

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
last night and this one and just gently

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:38.290 
last night and this one and just gently
remove<00:02:35.450> the<00:02:35.630> ponytail<00:02:36.110> holder<00:02:36.140> that<00:02:36.980> I<00:02:37.040> had<00:02:37.340> on

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:38.300 
remove the ponytail holder that I had on

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:44.530 
remove the ponytail holder that I had on
top<00:02:38.690> of<00:02:38.870> the<00:02:38.989> bottom

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:46.600 

okay<00:02:45.319> so<00:02:45.379> this<00:02:45.830> is<00:02:45.980> how<00:02:46.129> it<00:02:46.250> looks<00:02:46.400> from<00:02:46.549> the

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610 
okay so this is how it looks from the

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:51.250 
okay so this is how it looks from the
front

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.290 

and<00:02:51.830> it<00:02:51.950> was<00:02:52.069> combed<00:02:52.400> out<00:02:52.489> last<00:02:52.760> night<00:02:52.909> so<00:02:53.209> I'm

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:53.300 
and it was combed out last night so I'm

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:54.490 
and it was combed out last night so I'm
not<00:02:53.420> really<00:02:53.599> going<00:02:53.780> to<00:02:53.870> comb<00:02:54.050> it<00:02:54.170> out<00:02:54.260> right

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
not really going to comb it out right

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:58.860 
not really going to comb it out right
