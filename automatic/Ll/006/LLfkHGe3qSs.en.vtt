you what we have come up with it's a

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.750 
you what we have come up with it's a
very<00:02:47.360> simple<00:02:47.600> concept<00:02:48.020> for<00:02:48.920> applying<00:02:49.220> the

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 
very simple concept for applying the

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.880 
very simple concept for applying the
blind<00:02:50.060> now<00:02:50.240> can<00:02:50.450> use<00:02:50.600> actually<00:02:50.780> using<00:02:51.290> like

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:51.890 
blind now can use actually using like

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:55.510 
blind now can use actually using like
any<00:02:52.460> smartphone<00:02:53.680> but<00:02:54.680> where<00:02:55.100> you<00:02:55.220> can<00:02:55.340> just

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:55.520 
any smartphone but where you can just

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:59.800 
any smartphone but where you can just
follow<00:02:55.760> the<00:02:55.940> app<00:02:56.410> and<00:02:57.640> we<00:02:58.640> were<00:02:58.760> able<00:02:58.940> to<00:02:59.090> use

00:02:59.800 --> 00:02:59.810 
follow the app and we were able to use

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:02.560 
follow the app and we were able to use
it<00:03:00.220> how<00:03:01.220> okay<00:03:01.640> the<00:03:01.760> question<00:03:01.880> is<00:03:02.180> that<00:03:02.240> how

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:02.570 
it how okay the question is that how

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:07.300 
it how okay the question is that how
would<00:03:03.410> a<00:03:03.590> blind<00:03:04.390> know<00:03:05.390> where<00:03:06.140> to<00:03:06.260> touch<00:03:06.440> we<00:03:07.190> are
