00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:08.680
 the blue itself without it we can not fly 

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:10.840
 you have to recover them 

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:12.970
 in this new adventure of tinker bell 

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:15.790
 fairies and pirates we will meet the 

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:19.170
 Intrepid brave and ambitious fairy 

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:19.170
 sand be the fairies 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:24.810
 and exchange our talents she is 

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:27.450
 a guardian who steals the mighty dust 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.790
 magical fairy blue and this is not what 

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:32.279
 worse also joins with the terrible 

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:34.800
 pirates of the skull rock that we the 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:38.160
 named captain of the pirate ship you 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:41.129
 imagine that a year ago we had 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:44.960
 lost you our ship adrift and 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:48.610
 then she appeared 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.610
 hi girls how are you 

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:56.559
 I want to ask you a lot of questions 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:56.559
 where does the idea of â€‹â€‹this movie come from? 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.100
 the idea comes from 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:06.580
 9 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:08.740
 and I wanted to tell the story of a 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:11.170
 fairy who makes a mistake and escapes from 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:13.750
 her home and that is when she gives 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:16.660
 realize that you made a huge 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:18.490
 error moves away from everything that I want 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:21.520
 I really wanted to tell that story of 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:24.280
 redemption is this is Peter's world 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:26.080
 working in that world was a challenge 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:29.020
 for you 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:32.060
 it was an honor and a great responsibility 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:34.370
 we already know Peter and now 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.800
 a lot had been done about him so 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:39.440
 we had to investigate we had to see 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:41.479
 what's done and put it in our world like this 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:43.700
 we build this universe that does not 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:46.010
 had done the research was very 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:48.440
 inspiring to review what had already been 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:52.040
 done translate it and then build 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:53.690
 from that point it was great 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:56.180
 I go back to what was the biggest challenge 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:59.400
 for you in this movie I think 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:01.560
 that the biggest challenge was 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:03.930
 making sure we were doing 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.210
 well a classic of the nature of 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:08.340
 Peter Pan we have to make sure that 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:11.490
 we followed the same world of Peter Pan 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:14.280
 because we all love from the world 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:17.160
 we love the hook captain we love tinker 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.690
 bell every day we had to 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.550
 make sure that this movie 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:22.940
 continue with the classic story of 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.940
 disney 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:30.739
 upon learning that it is flour stole the 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:34.630
 magical blue zinc fairy dust and their 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:34.630
 friends are going to look for her 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.420
 just that on the way is flour 

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:47.470
 he exchanges his gifts what puts everything 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.470
 head something 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:54.409
 the cute 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:02.400
 in this super adventure too 

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:04.170
 we will meet james a smart 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:07.500
 sailor who will become the 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:10.709
 evil and terrible Captain Garcia did not 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:13.980
 stopped there did not do anything better than that 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:16.860
 better than everything will soon make all the 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:20.100
 ship fly 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:20.100
 How is it going 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:30.180
 and all the ideas to create the art of 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:30.180
 this movie 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:35.960
 the pirate idea 

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:41.850
 we had no idea what to do with that 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:43.800
 so the first thing was to check that 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:47.370
 they had done before the artists of 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:50.430
 disney we review peterpan things like 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:53.100
 those or more we also had a great staff 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:56.370
 that gave us many ideas after 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:58.620
 little by little we were clarifying and 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:02.630
 we enter the world of generating and creating 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:02.630
 new ideas and work together 

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:10.210
 what is your experience working in a 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:12.130
 classic as a peter pack is a big challenge 

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:14.150
 because they are characters that people 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:17.150
 know and call 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:20.660
 It is also a great opportunity because 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:23.060
 you already have possibilities so some of the 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:26.509
 work is done but you have to 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:28.160
 adapt them to a new story and there the 

00:04:26.509 --> 00:04:30.710
 challenge is to make sure that the actions 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:33.880
 go with the character and at the same time 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:33.880
 create something new 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:42.120
 and for me it was a great challenge to work with 

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:42.870
 the young James or the captain 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:46.710
 hook 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:52.400
 because he is an iconic character of Peter 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:55.699
 bread and everyone knows it and we do not want 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:57.830
 and the image that he has about him is broken 

00:04:55.699 --> 00:05:00.110
 so we have to get people 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:02.689
 I recognized it 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:07.689
 what is your favorite character 

00:05:02.689 --> 00:05:07.689
 the crocodile the crocodile 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:15.610
 because he 's really a bad boy that 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:15.610
 does evil things 

00:05:19.729 --> 00:05:28.289
 so we work together and of course 

00:05:25.409 --> 00:05:31.229
 that the flours is not surprising 

00:05:28.289 --> 00:05:33.179
 guys did a great job and let's go 

00:05:31.229 --> 00:05:36.119
 to see this movie in theaters very 

00:05:33.179 --> 00:05:38.669
 soon thank you very much 

00:05:36.119 --> 00:05:41.279
 adventures entangled big battles 

00:05:38.669 --> 00:05:43.499
 sword sword and much fairy dust 

00:05:41.279 --> 00:05:45.479
