00:00:02.139 --> 00:00:05.170 

the<00:00:03.139> rabbit<00:00:03.470> is<00:00:03.620> a<00:00:03.860> traditional<00:00:04.759> model<00:00:05.089> I

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:05.180 
the rabbit is a traditional model I

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:07.989 
the rabbit is a traditional model I
recommend<00:00:05.870> using<00:00:06.200> a<00:00:06.620> dual<00:00:06.890> color<00:00:07.189> paper<00:00:07.549> but

00:00:07.989 --> 00:00:07.999 
recommend using a dual color paper but

00:00:07.999 --> 00:00:10.390 
recommend using a dual color paper but
any<00:00:08.269> paper<00:00:08.540> will<00:00:08.780> do<00:00:08.929> the<00:00:09.110> job<00:00:09.139> and<00:00:09.500> it's<00:00:10.160> low

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:10.400 
any paper will do the job and it's low

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.629 
any paper will do the job and it's low
intermediate<00:00:10.759> because<00:00:11.360> it<00:00:11.570> contains<00:00:12.019> some

00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:12.639 
intermediate because it contains some

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:17.860 
intermediate because it contains some
swivel<00:00:13.639> folds<00:00:14.089> and<00:00:14.269> advanced<00:00:14.870> folds<00:00:16.750> first<00:00:17.750> of

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:17.870 
swivel folds and advanced folds first of

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:20.830 
swivel folds and advanced folds first of
all<00:00:18.430> the<00:00:19.430> color<00:00:19.670> side<00:00:19.910> down<00:00:19.940> and<00:00:20.420> fold

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:20.840 
all the color side down and fold

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:24.130 
all the color side down and fold
diagonally<00:00:21.580> so<00:00:22.580> this<00:00:23.240> color<00:00:23.510> will<00:00:23.960> be<00:00:24.110> the

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:24.140 
diagonally so this color will be the

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:26.290 
diagonally so this color will be the
color<00:00:24.440> of<00:00:24.530> the<00:00:24.830> rabbit<00:00:25.190> we<00:00:25.550> get<00:00:25.700> this<00:00:25.910> brownish

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:26.300 
color of the rabbit we get this brownish

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.630 
color of the rabbit we get this brownish
color<00:00:27.460> okay

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:28.640 
color okay

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.840 
color okay
now<00:00:29.480> we've<00:00:29.720> done<00:00:29.960> that<00:00:30.430> take<00:00:31.430> the<00:00:31.610> lower

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:31.850 
now we've done that take the lower

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:35.530 
now we've done that take the lower
corners<00:00:32.390> and<00:00:32.599> fold<00:00:33.050> them<00:00:33.200> upwards<00:00:34.390> to<00:00:35.390> the

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:35.540 
corners and fold them upwards to the

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:38.980 
corners and fold them upwards to the
corner<00:00:36.170> in<00:00:36.320> the<00:00:36.440> middle<00:00:36.710> also<00:00:37.670> nicely<00:00:38.270> visible

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:38.990 
corner in the middle also nicely visible

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:46.210 
corner in the middle also nicely visible
on<00:00:39.500> the<00:00:39.620> diagram<00:00:42.730> okay<00:00:44.470> now<00:00:45.470> make<00:00:45.680> sure<00:00:45.710> that

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:46.220 
on the diagram okay now make sure that

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:52.840 
on the diagram okay now make sure that
the<00:00:46.430> open<00:00:47.120> part<00:00:49.000> points<00:00:50.000> downwards<00:00:50.540> and<00:00:51.850> fold

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:52.850 
the open part points downwards and fold

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:58.470 
the open part points downwards and fold
the<00:00:53.270> edges<00:00:53.590> to<00:00:54.590> the<00:00:54.620> center<00:00:55.130> like<00:00:55.730> this<00:00:57.190> on

00:00:58.470 --> 00:00:58.480 
the edges to the center like this on

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:04.060 
the edges to the center like this on
both<00:00:59.480> sides<00:00:59.829> so<00:01:00.880> open<00:01:01.880> part<00:01:02.090> here<00:01:02.360> and<00:01:03.070> fold

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:04.070 
both sides so open part here and fold

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:08.319 
both sides so open part here and fold
there<00:01:04.579> and<00:01:05.560> the<00:01:06.560> same<00:01:06.799> thing<00:01:07.159> on<00:01:08.090> the<00:01:08.299> other

00:01:08.319 --> 00:01:08.329 
there and the same thing on the other

00:01:08.329 --> 00:01:20.739 
there and the same thing on the other
side

00:01:20.739 --> 00:01:20.749 

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:25.969 

now<00:01:21.749> we'll<00:01:22.229> do<00:01:22.560> a<00:01:22.859> squash<00:01:23.310> fold<00:01:23.340> I<00:01:24.979> prepare

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
now we'll do a squash fold I prepare

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.809 
now we'll do a squash fold I prepare
that<00:01:26.189> by<00:01:26.749> folding<00:01:27.749> this<00:01:28.130> angle<00:01:29.130> in<00:01:29.280> half<00:01:29.460> so

00:01:29.809 --> 00:01:29.819 
that by folding this angle in half so

00:01:29.819 --> 00:01:34.209 
that by folding this angle in half so
the<00:01:30.030> angle<00:01:30.359> bisector<00:01:30.929> then<00:01:31.890> open<00:01:32.609> it<00:01:32.700> up<00:01:32.789> again

00:01:34.209 --> 00:01:34.219 
the angle bisector then open it up again

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:37.760 
the angle bisector then open it up again
separate<00:01:35.359> the<00:01:36.359> four<00:01:36.630> layers<00:01:36.899> two<00:01:37.469> on<00:01:37.619> each

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
separate the four layers two on each

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:46.389 
separate the four layers two on each
side<00:01:38.130> and<00:01:39.890> push<00:01:40.890> down<00:01:41.219> oh<00:01:42.649> as<00:01:43.649> you<00:01:43.890> see<00:01:44.099> I

00:01:46.389 --> 00:01:46.399 

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:49.639 

didn't<00:01:47.399> arrange<00:01:48.090> the<00:01:48.390> layers<00:01:48.509> properly<00:01:49.200> so

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
didn't arrange the layers properly so

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.490 
didn't arrange the layers properly so
this<00:01:49.920> one<00:01:50.159> has<00:01:50.399> to<00:01:50.549> go<00:01:50.700> to<00:01:50.759> the<00:01:51.030> right<00:01:51.379> there<00:01:52.379> we

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
this one has to go to the right there we

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.999 
this one has to go to the right there we
go<00:01:52.649> and<00:01:55.369> also<00:01:56.369> on<00:01:56.610> the<00:01:56.759> other<00:01:56.789> side<00:01:57.179> just

00:01:57.999 --> 00:01:58.009 
go and also on the other side just

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:00.740 
go and also on the other side just
pre-crease<00:01:59.009> it's<00:01:59.280> optional<00:01:59.729> but<00:01:59.789> it<00:02:00.209> makes<00:02:00.539> it

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
pre-crease it's optional but it makes it

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:06.410 
pre-crease it's optional but it makes it
easier<00:02:01.200> for<00:02:01.259> beginners<00:02:01.860> so<00:02:03.409> open<00:02:04.409> and<00:02:05.420> push

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
easier for beginners so open and push

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.850 
easier for beginners so open and push
down<00:02:06.689> and<00:02:07.020> crease<00:02:07.679> again<00:02:08.690> so<00:02:09.690> now<00:02:10.560> we<00:02:10.619> have

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
down and crease again so now we have

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.610 
down and crease again so now we have
those<00:02:11.239> big<00:02:12.239> pockets<00:02:12.720> we<00:02:12.930> fold<00:02:13.200> the<00:02:13.379> whole

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
those big pockets we fold the whole

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.530 
those big pockets we fold the whole
thing<00:02:13.680> in<00:02:13.980> half

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.360 

you<00:02:18.540> already<00:02:18.810> see<00:02:19.140> those<00:02:19.379> ears<00:02:19.799> here<00:02:20.220> and

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
you already see those ears here and

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.699 
you already see those ears here and
you'll<00:02:21.560> grab<00:02:22.560> the<00:02:22.739> ear<00:02:22.950> and<00:02:23.220> swivel<00:02:23.849> it<00:02:23.970> around

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:24.709 
you'll grab the ear and swivel it around

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:31.150 
you'll grab the ear and swivel it around
just<00:02:25.709> like<00:02:25.859> this<00:02:26.810> so<00:02:28.790> simply<00:02:29.790> turn<00:02:30.209> the<00:02:30.900> paper

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.160 
just like this so simply turn the paper

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:36.199 
just like this so simply turn the paper
inside<00:02:32.160> of<00:02:32.430> the<00:02:32.579> model<00:02:32.880> and<00:02:33.840> then<00:02:35.209> make

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
inside of the model and then make

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:41.270 
inside of the model and then make
everything<00:02:36.510> nice<00:02:36.870> and<00:02:37.200> flat<00:02:37.849> so<00:02:39.769> this<00:02:40.769> is<00:02:40.980> the

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
everything nice and flat so this is the

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.020 
everything nice and flat so this is the
thing<00:02:41.730> you<00:02:41.760> will<00:02:42.000> do<00:02:42.209> also<00:02:42.510> on<00:02:43.169> the<00:02:43.290> other<00:02:43.319> side

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
thing you will do also on the other side

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:48.259 
thing you will do also on the other side
this<00:02:45.030> is<00:02:45.299> what<00:02:45.599> the<00:02:46.069> our<00:02:47.069> black<00:02:47.609> arrow<00:02:47.849> and<00:02:48.120> the

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:48.269 
this is what the our black arrow and the

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:52.370 
this is what the our black arrow and the
diagram<00:02:48.750> means<00:02:49.609> with<00:02:50.609> the<00:02:50.819> single<00:02:51.750> bar<00:02:51.930> that

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
diagram means with the single bar that

00:02:52.380 --> 00:03:00.110 
diagram means with the single bar that
we<00:02:52.560> repeated<00:02:53.400> on<00:02:53.579> the<00:02:53.700> backside<00:02:54.120> so<00:02:55.069> and<00:02:59.120> there

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
we repeated on the backside so and there

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:09.379 
we repeated on the backside so and there
we<00:03:00.359> go<00:03:01.400> okay<00:03:02.900> make<00:03:03.900> it<00:03:03.930> look<00:03:04.230> nice<00:03:05.040> and<00:03:06.799> now<00:03:08.389> we

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:09.389 
we go okay make it look nice and now we

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:15.580 
we go okay make it look nice and now we
fold<00:03:09.750> the<00:03:10.049> ears

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:15.590 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:19.160 

this<00:03:16.590> way<00:03:16.770> so<00:03:16.830> here<00:03:17.730> goes<00:03:17.970> the<00:03:18.120> crease<00:03:18.390> and<00:03:19.020> we

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
this way so here goes the crease and we

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:23.300 
this way so here goes the crease and we
fold<00:03:19.410> through<00:03:20.370> that<00:03:20.520> corner<00:03:21.410> from<00:03:22.410> here<00:03:22.710> to

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
fold through that corner from here to

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:25.760 
fold through that corner from here to
this<00:03:23.490> point<00:03:23.610> so<00:03:24.240> the<00:03:24.720> edge<00:03:24.900> is<00:03:25.170> aligned<00:03:25.500> with

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:25.770 
this point so the edge is aligned with

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:31.190 
this point so the edge is aligned with
that<00:03:26.730> rectangle<00:03:27.690> here<00:03:28.680> and<00:03:29.959> the<00:03:30.959> same<00:03:31.140> thing

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 
that rectangle here and the same thing

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:36.290 
that rectangle here and the same thing
on<00:03:31.740> the<00:03:31.920> back<00:03:32.100> so<00:03:33.030> here's<00:03:33.840> crease<00:03:34.850> and<00:03:35.850> there

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:36.300 
on the back so here's crease and there

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:42.590 
on the back so here's crease and there
we<00:03:36.690> go<00:03:37.280> so<00:03:38.280> the<00:03:38.490> edge<00:03:38.640> is<00:03:40.610> vertical<00:03:41.610> there<00:03:42.480> we

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:42.600 
we go so the edge is vertical there we

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:47.449 
we go so the edge is vertical there we
go<00:03:44.180> now<00:03:45.260> separate<00:03:46.260> the<00:03:46.440> layers<00:03:46.620> and<00:03:46.950> wrap<00:03:47.280> them

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459 
go now separate the layers and wrap them

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:50.060 
go now separate the layers and wrap them
around<00:03:47.610> here<00:03:48.260> creating<00:03:49.260> a<00:03:49.350> crease<00:03:49.650> here<00:03:50.010> and

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:50.070 
around here creating a crease here and

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:55.420 
around here creating a crease here and
on<00:03:50.670> the<00:03:50.910> back<00:03:51.060> side<00:03:51.320> and<00:03:52.320> also<00:03:52.530> crease<00:03:52.980> you<00:03:53.190> so

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:55.430 
on the back side and also crease you so

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:59.479 
on the back side and also crease you so
pull<00:03:56.430> them<00:03:57.209> back<00:03:57.480> and<00:03:57.750> the<00:03:58.410> front<00:03:58.739> will<00:03:58.980> move

00:03:59.479 --> 00:03:59.489 
pull them back and the front will move

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:03.410 
pull them back and the front will move
downwards<00:04:00.830> creating<00:04:01.830> the<00:04:02.040> head<00:04:02.220> of<00:04:02.459> the

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:03.420 
downwards creating the head of the

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:07.040 
downwards creating the head of the
rabbit<00:04:03.780> that<00:04:04.760> could<00:04:05.760> be<00:04:05.970> a<00:04:06.000> little<00:04:06.270> tricky<00:04:06.390> so

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:07.050 
rabbit that could be a little tricky so

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:08.960 
rabbit that could be a little tricky so
take<00:04:07.770> your<00:04:07.920> time<00:04:08.160> for<00:04:08.340> that<00:04:08.489> now

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970 
take your time for that now

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:11.120 
take your time for that now

advance so it's optional and not shown
on<00:05:01.979> the<00:05:02.100> diagram<00:05:02.630> so<00:05:03.630> separate<00:05:04.500> the<00:05:04.650> two

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:04.800 
on the diagram so separate the two

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:07.580 
on the diagram so separate the two
layers<00:05:05.040> and<00:05:05.540> inside<00:05:06.540> reverse<00:05:06.840> fold<00:05:07.110> that<00:05:07.320> part

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:07.590 
layers and inside reverse fold that part

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:09.880 
layers and inside reverse fold that part
and<00:05:07.770> then<00:05:08.070> put<00:05:08.700> them<00:05:08.880> back<00:05:09.030> together<00:05:09.270> and

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:09.890 
and then put them back together and

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:16.120 
and then put them back together and
repeat<00:05:10.890> the<00:05:11.250> two<00:05:11.460> inside<00:05:12.360> reverse<00:05:12.660> folds<00:05:13.110> so

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:16.130 

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:19.370 

now<00:05:17.130> we<00:05:17.190> are<00:05:17.520> done<00:05:17.760> with<00:05:17.880> the<00:05:18.030> folding<00:05:18.390> you<00:05:19.110> can

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:19.380 
now we are done with the folding you can

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:22.340 
now we are done with the folding you can
separate<00:05:20.340> the<00:05:21.000> lower<00:05:21.180> part<00:05:21.539> a<00:05:21.690> little

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:22.350 
separate the lower part a little

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:26.030 
separate the lower part a little
ended<00:05:22.590> to<00:05:23.400> make<00:05:23.550> it<00:05:23.700> stand<00:05:24.020> and<00:05:25.020> now<00:05:25.830> we're

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:26.040 
ended to make it stand and now we're

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:26.450 
ended to make it stand and now we're
done
