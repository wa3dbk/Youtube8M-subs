00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
think it's five or six colors they had

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.960 
think it's five or six colors they had
some<00:01:14.130> nude<00:01:14.400> colors<00:01:14.939> in<00:01:15.560> a<00:01:16.560> red<00:01:16.950> one<00:01:17.340> a<00:01:17.670> really

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
some nude colors in a red one a really

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.249 
some nude colors in a red one a really
bright<00:01:18.210> pink<00:01:18.540> this<00:01:19.200> purple<00:01:19.799> one<00:01:20.009> and<00:01:21.200> kind<00:01:22.200> of

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
bright pink this purple one and kind of

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.460 
bright pink this purple one and kind of
coral<00:01:22.710> one<00:01:22.890> I<00:01:23.100> think<00:01:23.460> am<00:01:24.180> they're<00:01:24.450> all<00:01:24.630> $4.99<00:01:25.259> I

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
coral one I think am they're all $4.99 I

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:26.240 
coral one I think am they're all $4.99 I
think<00:01:25.680> that<00:01:25.799> might<00:01:25.920> just<00:01:25.950> be<00:01:26.159> the

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
think that might just be the

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.789 
think that might just be the
introduction<00:01:26.790> place<00:01:27.360> but<00:01:27.720> usually<00:01:28.530> sneak

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
introduction place but usually sneak

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.399 
introduction place but usually sneak
stuff<00:01:29.009> is<00:01:29.310> really<00:01:29.610> reasonably<00:01:30.150> placed<00:01:30.450> so<00:01:31.350> I

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
stuff is really reasonably placed so I

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.080 
stuff is really reasonably placed so I
was<00:01:31.530> super<00:01:31.770> excited<00:01:32.009> about<00:01:32.549> this<00:01:32.790> product

their<00:03:14.790> products<00:03:15.060> so<00:03:15.239> much<00:03:15.420> that<00:03:15.600> I<00:03:15.660> thought

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
their products so much that I thought

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:16.970 
their products so much that I thought
that<00:03:15.900> this<00:03:16.109> would<00:03:16.260> be<00:03:16.320> like<00:03:16.530> the<00:03:16.680> perfect

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
that this would be like the perfect

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.370 
that this would be like the perfect
formula<00:03:17.640> I<00:03:18.030> just<00:03:18.450> feel<00:03:18.570> like<00:03:18.690> the<00:03:18.810> formula<00:03:19.230> as

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
formula I just feel like the formula as

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:23.120 
formula I just feel like the formula as
in<00:03:19.650> the<00:03:20.310> based<00:03:20.579> and<00:03:20.940> the<00:03:21.120> steam<00:03:21.420> power<00:03:22.130> it's

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
in the based and the steam power it's

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:25.099 
in the based and the steam power it's
not<00:03:23.280> as<00:03:23.760> long<00:03:24.030> lasting<00:03:24.060> as<00:03:24.630> you<00:03:24.930> would<00:03:25.019> expect

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:25.109 
not as long lasting as you would expect

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:27.590 
not as long lasting as you would expect
from<00:03:25.829> these<00:03:25.980> other<00:03:26.430> matte<00:03:27.150> lipsticks<00:03:27.540> that

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.600 
from these other matte lipsticks that
