looking<00:00:03.720> at<00:00:03.840> today<00:00:04.020> is<00:00:04.350> the<00:00:04.560> aterna<00:00:05.100> moon

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:06.000

phase<00:00:06.270> mono<00:00:06.690> pusher<00:00:07.200> chronograph<00:00:10.429> u-turn<00:00:11.429> is

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
phase mono pusher chronograph u-turn is

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.310 
phase mono pusher chronograph u-turn is
one<00:00:11.820> of<00:00:11.940> those<00:00:12.030> brands<00:00:12.480> that<00:00:12.540> I've<00:00:12.719> just

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
one of those brands that I've just

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.980 
one of those brands that I've just
something<00:00:14.250> about<00:00:14.340> them<00:00:14.969> just<00:00:15.389> draws<00:00:15.719> me

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
something about them just draws me

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.019 
something about them just draws me
towards<00:00:16.230> the<00:00:16.529> watches<00:00:17.010> I<00:00:17.130> just<00:00:17.369> I<00:00:17.580> really<00:00:17.850> love

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
towards the watches I just I really love

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.240 
towards the watches I just I really love
the<00:00:18.180> designs<00:00:18.570> of<00:00:18.750> most<00:00:19.080> of<00:00:19.230> their<00:00:19.320> watches<00:00:19.560> and

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
the designs of most of their watches and

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.120 
the designs of most of their watches and
I<00:00:20.760> think<00:00:21.630> that<00:00:22.020> for<00:00:22.260> the<00:00:22.320> most<00:00:22.470> part<00:00:22.830> a<00:00:22.890> lot<00:00:23.010> of

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
I think that for the most part a lot of

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.650 
I think that for the most part a lot of
their<00:00:23.220> watches<00:00:23.430> are<00:00:23.760> undervalued<00:00:23.970> so<00:00:26.510> the<00:00:27.510> one

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
their watches are undervalued so the one

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.500 
their watches are undervalued so the one
I'm<00:00:27.810> looking<00:00:28.080> at<00:00:28.199> today<00:00:28.680> is<00:00:29.150> pretty<00:00:30.150> unique

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
I'm looking at today is pretty unique

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.740 
I'm looking at today is pretty unique
because<00:00:30.810> II<00:00:31.439> Turner<00:00:32.040> has<00:00:32.219> taken<00:00:32.489> in<00:00:32.610> ETA<00:00:33.030> 77

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
because II Turner has taken in ETA 77

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.650 
because II Turner has taken in ETA 77
fifty<00:00:34.020> one<00:00:34.200> and<00:00:34.380> they've<00:00:34.469> modified<00:00:34.829> it<00:00:35.660> so

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
fifty one and they've modified it so

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.869 
fifty one and they've modified it so
that<00:00:36.690> the<00:00:37.680> chronograph<00:00:38.309> uses<00:00:38.670> the<00:00:38.730> model

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
that the chronograph uses the model

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.190 
that the chronograph uses the model
pusher<00:00:39.180> mechanism<00:00:39.800> so<00:00:40.800> instead<00:00:41.190> of<00:00:41.989> using<00:00:42.989> a

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
pusher mechanism so instead of using a

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.500 
pusher mechanism so instead of using a
separate<00:00:43.530> reset<00:00:43.950> button<00:00:44.370> as<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:45.000> start<00:00:45.420> and

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
separate reset button as the start and

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.090 
separate reset button as the start and
stop<00:00:45.750> pusher<00:00:46.230> they've<00:00:46.379> incorporated<00:00:46.710> all

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
stop pusher they've incorporated all

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.910 
stop pusher they've incorporated all
it's<00:00:47.250> a<00:00:47.340> single<00:00:47.670> button<00:00:48.410> I'm<00:00:49.410> going<00:00:49.649> to<00:00:49.770> show

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
it's a single button I'm going to show

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.500 
it's a single button I'm going to show
you<00:00:49.980> how<00:00:50.190> that<00:00:50.340> works<00:00:50.520> here<00:00:50.879> so<00:00:51.120> this<00:00:51.300> is

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
you how that works here so this is

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.119 
you how that works here so this is
normally<00:00:52.050> where<00:00:52.199> the<00:00:52.350> start<00:00:52.559> and<00:00:52.649> stop<00:00:52.710> isn't

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
normally where the start and stop isn't

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.299 
normally where the start and stop isn't
and<00:00:53.460> typically<00:00:54.059> honest<00:00:54.530> 77<00:00:55.530> 51<00:00:55.980> you'll<00:00:56.160> see

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
and typically honest 77 51 you'll see

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.880 
and typically honest 77 51 you'll see
the<00:00:56.570> reset<00:00:57.570> down<00:00:57.690> at<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:57.930> bottom<00:00:58.079> but<00:00:58.440> here

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
the reset down at the bottom but here

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:08.630 
the reset down at the bottom but here
you<00:00:59.699> see<00:00:59.730> the<00:01:04.519> start/stop<00:01:07.010> reset<00:01:08.010> on<00:01:08.340> one

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
you see the start/stop reset on one

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.740 
you see the start/stop reset on one
button<00:01:08.850> now<00:01:10.250> some<00:01:11.420> suppose<00:01:12.420> one<00:01:12.600> of<00:01:12.689> the

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
button now some suppose one of the

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.179 
button now some suppose one of the
limitations<00:01:13.320> of<00:01:13.470> having<00:01:13.770> that<00:01:13.890> type<00:01:14.159> of

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
limitations of having that type of

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.490 
limitations of having that type of
movement<00:01:14.729> is<00:01:14.820> that<00:01:15.119> you<00:01:15.210> can't<00:01:15.450> stop<00:01:15.810> the

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
movement is that you can't stop the

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.760 
movement is that you can't stop the
chronograph<00:01:17.009> and<00:01:17.250> then<00:01:17.340> restarted<00:01:17.880> again<00:01:18.170> but

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:21.770 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:24.590 

given<00:01:22.770> that<00:01:22.979> for<00:01:23.580> the<00:01:23.640> most<00:01:23.820> part<00:01:23.939> it's<00:01:24.270> just

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
given that for the most part it's just

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.780 
given that for the most part it's just
uh<00:01:25.430> it's<00:01:26.430> more<00:01:26.700> it's<00:01:27.390> more<00:01:28.340> gimmick<00:01:29.340> so<00:01:29.729> to

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
uh it's more it's more gimmick so to

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.969 
uh it's more it's more gimmick so to
speak<00:01:30.150> than<00:01:30.869> anything<00:01:31.079> else<00:01:31.320> just<00:01:31.530> sort<00:01:31.710> of<00:01:31.860> a

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
speak than anything else just sort of a

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.819 
speak than anything else just sort of a
horological<00:01:32.520> achievement<00:01:34.040> it's<00:01:35.040> not<00:01:35.310> really

00:01:36.819 --> 00:01:36.829 
horological achievement it's not really

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:39.940 
horological achievement it's not really
it's<00:01:37.829> not<00:01:37.920> really<00:01:38.040> a<00:01:38.280> functional<00:01:38.850> a

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950 
it's not really a functional a

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:44.359 
it's not really a functional a
functional<00:01:41.570> feature<00:01:42.829> it's<00:01:43.829> just<00:01:44.040> to<00:01:44.159> show<00:01:44.340> off

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
functional feature it's just to show off

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.340 
functional feature it's just to show off
what<00:01:44.700> they<00:01:44.820> can<00:01:44.850> do<00:01:45.149> which<00:01:46.140> is<00:01:46.170> kind<00:01:46.860> of<00:01:46.950> cool

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:48.350 
what they can do which is kind of cool

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:50.389 
what they can do which is kind of cool
you'll<00:01:49.350> notice<00:01:49.530> that<00:01:49.680> the<00:01:49.890> moon<00:01:50.070> phases

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
you'll notice that the moon phases

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.789 
you'll notice that the moon phases
they're<00:01:50.909> at<00:01:51.030> six<00:01:51.329> o'clock<00:01:51.450> with<00:01:51.990> no<00:01:52.380> hand

the hour sub dial is there that means

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.410 
the hour sub dial is there that means
that<00:02:00.630> this<00:02:00.780> chronograph<00:02:01.320> only<00:02:01.590> counts<00:02:01.890> up<00:02:02.130> to

that this chronograph only counts up to
29<00:02:03.420> minutes<00:02:03.659> and<00:02:03.689> 59<00:02:04.049> seconds<00:02:04.710> after<00:02:05.670> which<00:02:05.790> it

29 minutes and 59 seconds after which it
just<00:02:06.439> restarts<00:02:07.439> again<00:02:07.710> that<00:02:08.270> at<00:02:09.270> zero<00:02:09.989> zero

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289
