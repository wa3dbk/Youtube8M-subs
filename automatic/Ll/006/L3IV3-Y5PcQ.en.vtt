may<00:00:00.269> that<00:00:00.780> may<00:00:00.960> not<00:00:01.079> really<00:00:01.410> be<00:00:01.589> what<00:00:01.949> I<00:00:01.979> want

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:02.220 
may that may not really be what I want

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:03.740 
may that may not really be what I want
to<00:00:02.340> do<00:00:02.490> I<00:00:02.700> don't<00:00:02.850> necessarily<00:00:03.000> want<00:00:03.570> to

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:03.750 
to do I don't necessarily want to

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:05.809 
to do I don't necessarily want to
project<00:00:03.929> it<00:00:04.350> associatively<00:00:04.980> from<00:00:05.339> one<00:00:05.549> part

00:00:05.809 --> 00:00:05.819 
project it associatively from one part

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:08.000 
project it associatively from one part
to<00:00:05.879> another<00:00:06.029> so<00:00:06.990> I'm<00:00:07.049> going<00:00:07.109> to<00:00:07.290> undo<00:00:07.620> that<00:00:07.799> and

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
to another so I'm going to undo that and

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.339 
to another so I'm going to undo that and
that<00:00:08.970> the<00:00:09.120> trick<00:00:09.389> here<00:00:09.660> is<00:00:09.809> when<00:00:10.230> you<00:00:10.290> use

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
that the trick here is when you use

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:13.549 
that the trick here is when you use
project<00:00:10.710> geometry<00:00:11.639> if<00:00:11.849> you<00:00:12.480> hold<00:00:12.750> down<00:00:12.870> the

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
project geometry if you hold down the

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:15.530 
project geometry if you hold down the
control<00:00:14.040> key<00:00:14.070> you'll<00:00:14.670> notice<00:00:14.910> that<00:00:15.059> i<00:00:15.210> can<00:00:15.389> now

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
control key you'll notice that i can now

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.150 
control key you'll notice that i can now
come<00:00:15.780> in<00:00:15.870> and<00:00:16.020> do<00:00:16.109> much<00:00:16.289> the<00:00:16.470> same<00:00:16.650> thing<00:00:16.949> will

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
come in and do much the same thing will

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.370 
come in and do much the same thing will
select<00:00:17.580> some<00:00:17.760> of<00:00:17.850> these<00:00:17.940> edges<00:00:18.420> and<00:00:18.570> instead

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
select some of these edges and instead

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.950 
select some of these edges and instead
of<00:00:19.500> it<00:00:19.680> projecting<00:00:20.340> these<00:00:20.580> as<00:00:20.880> an<00:00:21.390> adaptive

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
of it projecting these as an adaptive

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.650 
of it projecting these as an adaptive
edge<00:00:22.289> it's<00:00:23.100> not<00:00:23.400> it's<00:00:24.000> not<00:00:24.090> making<00:00:24.539> an

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
edge it's not it's not making an

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.630 
edge it's not it's not making an
adaptive<00:00:25.109> sketch<00:00:25.500> I<00:00:25.740> believe<00:00:26.099> this<00:00:26.250> part<00:00:26.490> was

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
adaptive sketch I believe this part was

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.250 
adaptive sketch I believe this part was
already<00:00:26.939> adapted<00:00:27.390> so<00:00:27.539> maybe<00:00:27.720> this<00:00:27.869> is<00:00:28.019> a<00:00:28.050> bad

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
already adapted so maybe this is a bad

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.380 
already adapted so maybe this is a bad
exam<00:00:28.619> oh<00:00:28.769> no<00:00:28.920> it's<00:00:29.160> not<00:00:29.310> so<00:00:30.150> it's<00:00:30.269> not

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
exam oh no it's not so it's not

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.209 
exam oh no it's not so it's not
automatically<00:00:30.929> making<00:00:31.349> it<00:00:31.470> adaptive<00:00:31.980> and

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
automatically making it adaptive and

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.700 
automatically making it adaptive and
it's<00:00:32.369> not<00:00:32.579> adapting<00:00:33.239> any<00:00:33.570> of<00:00:33.780> the<00:00:33.930> geometry<00:00:34.559> so

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
it's not adapting any of the geometry so

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.560 
it's not adapting any of the geometry so
it's<00:00:34.860> just<00:00:34.950> projecting<00:00:35.579> it<00:00:35.670> over<00:00:35.940> a<00:00:35.969> static

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
it's just projecting it over a static

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.049 
it's just projecting it over a static
geometry<00:00:37.260> so<00:00:37.920> that<00:00:38.129> from<00:00:38.399> there<00:00:38.610> if<00:00:38.940> you

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
geometry so that from there if you

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:40.639 
geometry so that from there if you
wanted<00:00:39.300> to<00:00:39.390> pick<00:00:39.600> and<00:00:39.750> drag<00:00:39.930> it<00:00:40.079> around<00:00:40.200> you

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
wanted to pick and drag it around you

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.110 
wanted to pick and drag it around you
could<00:00:40.920> and<00:00:41.190> make<00:00:41.790> modifications<00:00:43.940> so<00:00:44.940> with

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
could and make modifications so with

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.639 
could and make modifications so with
that<00:00:45.270> that's<00:00:45.480> a<00:00:45.690> that's<00:00:45.930> one<00:00:46.200> of<00:00:46.289> the<00:00:46.379> tips

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
that that's a that's one of the tips

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.410 
that that's a that's one of the tips
oftentimes<00:00:47.190> when<00:00:47.579> I'm<00:00:47.789> working<00:00:48.000> in<00:00:48.300> an

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
oftentimes when I'm working in an

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.200 
oftentimes when I'm working in an
assembly<00:00:48.719> editing<00:00:49.350> apart<00:00:49.710> I<00:00:50.210> project

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
assembly editing apart I project

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.389 
assembly editing apart I project
something<00:00:51.449> it's<00:00:51.840> adaptive<00:00:52.620> I<00:00:52.770> have<00:00:52.890> to<00:00:53.039> undo

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
something it's adaptive I have to undo

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.310 
something it's adaptive I have to undo
it<00:00:53.579> or<00:00:53.760> turn<00:00:54.180> the<00:00:54.329> adaptivity<00:00:54.719> off<00:00:55.020> on<00:00:55.199> the

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
it or turn the adaptivity off on the

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.410 
it or turn the adaptivity off on the
part<00:00:55.559> and<00:00:55.789> we<00:00:56.789> went<00:00:56.969> through<00:00:57.149> some<00:00:57.270> of<00:00:57.360> the

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
part and we went through some of the

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.540 
part and we went through some of the
adaptive<00:00:58.250> enhancements<00:00:59.250> or<00:00:59.370> not

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
adaptive enhancements or not

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.790 
adaptive enhancements or not
enhancements<00:01:00.120> but<00:01:00.410> capabilities<00:01:01.410> last

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
enhancements but capabilities last

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.979 
enhancements but capabilities last
podcast<00:01:02.129> so<00:01:03.120> if<00:01:03.210> you're<00:01:03.329> not<00:01:03.480> familiar<00:01:03.629> with

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
podcast so if you're not familiar with

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.539 
podcast so if you're not familiar with
what<00:01:04.170> adaptivity<00:01:04.619> is<00:01:04.890> you<00:01:05.040> may<00:01:05.159> want<00:01:05.339> to<00:01:05.400> take

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
what adaptivity is you may want to take

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.120 
what adaptivity is you may want to take
a<00:01:05.610> look<00:01:05.850> at<00:01:05.939> that<00:01:06.150> one<00:01:06.360> but<00:01:07.049> in<00:01:07.710> some<00:01:08.100> cases

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
a look at that one but in some cases

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.740 
a look at that one but in some cases
it's<00:01:08.640> can<00:01:08.790> be<00:01:08.880> able<00:01:09.060> to<00:01:09.180> project<00:01:09.390> this

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
it's can be able to project this

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.510 
it's can be able to project this
geometry<00:01:10.080> keep<00:01:10.619> it<00:01:10.770> adaptive<00:01:11.250> and<00:01:11.400> move

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
geometry keep it adaptive and move

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.039 
geometry keep it adaptive and move
forward<00:01:11.820> but<00:01:12.090> this<00:01:12.390> is<00:01:12.479> a<00:01:12.510> really<00:01:12.780> quick<00:01:12.990> way

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
forward but this is a really quick way

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.920 
forward but this is a really quick way
to<00:01:13.229> not<00:01:13.860> have<00:01:14.010> to<00:01:14.070> worry<00:01:14.340> about<00:01:14.460> that<00:01:14.930> all

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
to not have to worry about that all

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.440 
to not have to worry about that all
right<00:01:16.110> so<00:01:16.259> then<00:01:16.409> let's<00:01:16.650> go<00:01:16.830> into<00:01:17.040> our<00:01:17.450> final

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
right so then let's go into our final

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.850 
right so then let's go into our final
tip<00:01:18.990> I'm<00:01:19.530> just<00:01:19.799> going<00:01:19.950> to<00:01:19.979> return<00:01:20.430> up<00:01:20.670> and

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:21.860 
tip I'm just going to return up and

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:25.870 
tip I'm just going to return up and
let's<00:01:22.860> get<00:01:23.159> out<00:01:23.369> of<00:01:23.450> this<00:01:24.450> particular<00:01:25.020> part

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:25.880 
let's get out of this particular part

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.179 
let's get out of this particular part
now<00:01:26.880> let's<00:01:27.119> say<00:01:27.360> that<00:01:27.659> will<00:01:28.350> take<00:01:28.560> this<00:01:28.770> this

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
now let's say that will take this this

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.160 
now let's say that will take this this
part<00:01:29.520> and<00:01:29.700> I'm<00:01:30.299> going<00:01:30.450> to<00:01:30.540> delete<00:01:30.659> all<00:01:31.020> the

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
part and I'm going to delete all the

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.980 
part and I'm going to delete all the
constraint<00:01:31.740> from<00:01:32.189> this<00:01:32.549> part<00:01:32.850> so<00:01:33.630> let's<00:01:33.810> just

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
constraint from this part so let's just

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.749 
constraint from this part so let's just
come<00:01:34.170> in<00:01:34.320> to<00:01:34.500> the<00:01:34.650> different<00:01:35.280> constraints

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
come in to the different constraints

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:40.789 
come in to the different constraints
will<00:01:36.119> get<00:01:36.299> rid<00:01:36.509> of<00:01:36.540> them<00:01:36.780> so<00:01:39.200> I<00:01:40.200> can<00:01:40.229> just<00:01:40.500> drag

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
will get rid of them so I can just drag

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.429 
will get rid of them so I can just drag
this<00:01:40.979> around<00:01:41.189> and<00:01:41.700> one<00:01:42.479> of<00:01:42.600> the<00:01:42.750> the<00:01:43.049> tips<00:01:43.320> I

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
this around and one of the the tips I

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.620 
this around and one of the the tips I
use<00:01:43.680> often<00:01:43.920> times<00:01:44.280> when<00:01:44.399> I'm<00:01:44.549> working<00:01:44.759> in<00:01:45.329> an

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
use often times when I'm working in an

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.980 
use often times when I'm working in an
assembly<00:01:46.079> is<00:01:46.759> G<00:01:47.759> allows<00:01:48.030> me<00:01:48.240> to<00:01:48.360> if<00:01:48.630> I<00:01:48.780> select

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
assembly is G allows me to if I select

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.960 
assembly is G allows me to if I select
it<00:01:49.200> and<00:01:49.259> hit<00:01:49.350> G<00:01:49.710> I<00:01:49.920> can<00:01:50.159> just<00:01:50.280> orbit<00:01:50.729> it<00:01:50.850> and

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
it and hit G I can just orbit it and

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.580 
it and hit G I can just orbit it and
kind<00:01:51.180> of<00:01:51.240> position<00:01:51.780> it<00:01:51.899> in<00:01:52.049> a<00:01:52.170> way<00:01:52.290> that<00:01:52.320> i<00:01:52.500> can

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
kind of position it in a way that i can

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.010 
kind of position it in a way that i can
see<00:01:52.920> face<00:01:53.189> is<00:01:53.399> easier<00:01:53.790> this<00:01:54.420> is<00:01:54.540> a<00:01:54.570> nice<00:01:54.750> way<00:01:54.960> to

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
see face is easier this is a nice way to

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.270 
see face is easier this is a nice way to
start<00:01:55.170> out<00:01:55.500> when<00:01:55.649> I'm<00:01:55.770> constraining

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
start out when I'm constraining

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.100 
start out when I'm constraining
something<00:01:56.759> to<00:01:56.850> just<00:01:57.060> kind<00:01:57.240> of<00:01:57.360> to<00:01:57.659> get<00:01:57.810> some<00:01:58.020> of

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
something to just kind of to get some of

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.440 
something to just kind of to get some of
those<00:01:58.200> faces<00:01:58.649> that<00:01:58.680> I<00:01:58.829> want<00:01:59.130> now<00:01:59.909> if<00:02:00.090> I<00:02:00.210> want<00:02:00.390> to

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
those faces that I want now if I want to

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.030 
those faces that I want now if I want to
constrain<00:02:00.930> this<00:02:01.140> in<00:02:01.290> place<00:02:01.560> one<00:02:01.860> of<00:02:01.950> the

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
constrain this in place one of the

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.609 
constrain this in place one of the
things<00:02:02.280> that<00:02:02.430> you<00:02:02.700> may<00:02:02.850> often<00:02:03.180> find<00:02:03.689> is<00:02:03.930> you

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
things that you may often find is you

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.350 
things that you may often find is you
start<00:02:04.890> the<00:02:05.040> constraint<00:02:05.520> dialogue<00:02:06.000> and<00:02:06.270> you

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
start the constraint dialogue and you

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:07.880 
start the constraint dialogue and you
tell<00:02:06.570> it<00:02:06.689> what<00:02:06.810> type<00:02:07.020> of<00:02:07.049> constraint<00:02:07.680> and<00:02:07.799> all

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
tell it what type of constraint and all

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.859 
tell it what type of constraint and all
those<00:02:08.039> types<00:02:08.099> of<00:02:08.459> things<00:02:08.520> but<00:02:09.420> there<00:02:09.599> is<00:02:09.720> a<00:02:09.750> way

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
those types of things but there is a way

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.300 
those types of things but there is a way
to<00:02:10.020> do<00:02:10.259> this<00:02:10.410> without<00:02:10.560> going<00:02:10.979> into<00:02:11.220> the

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
to do this without going into the

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.100 
to do this without going into the
constraint<00:02:11.910> dialogue<00:02:12.420> if

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
constraint dialogue if

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:14.600 
constraint dialogue if
you'll<00:02:13.230> if<00:02:13.680> you<00:02:13.890> hold<00:02:14.010> down<00:02:14.100> the<00:02:14.310> Alt<00:02:14.490> key

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
you'll if you hold down the Alt key

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.040 
you'll if you hold down the Alt key
you'll<00:02:14.880> notice<00:02:15.150> that<00:02:15.180> you<00:02:15.390> can<00:02:15.540> click<00:02:15.780> and

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
you'll notice that you can click and

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:19.400 
you'll notice that you can click and
drag<00:02:16.290> say<00:02:16.890> a<00:02:16.920> face<00:02:17.720> drag<00:02:18.720> over<00:02:19.020> to<00:02:19.200> another

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
drag say a face drag over to another

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:23.180 
drag say a face drag over to another
face<00:02:19.890> it's<00:02:20.250> giving<00:02:20.670> me<00:02:20.700> the<00:02:20.820> mate<00:02:21.180> icon<00:02:22.080> let<00:02:23.010> up

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
face it's giving me the mate icon let up

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:25.070 
face it's giving me the mate icon let up
and<00:02:23.400> I<00:02:23.730> can<00:02:23.910> see<00:02:24.150> there<00:02:24.390> that<00:02:24.600> it's<00:02:24.900> actually

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
and I can see there that it's actually

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.140 
and I can see there that it's actually
putting<00:02:25.560> a<00:02:25.740> mate<00:02:26.010> constraint<00:02:26.580> now<00:02:26.730> between

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
putting a mate constraint now between

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.510 
putting a mate constraint now between
those<00:02:27.420> two<00:02:27.630> components<00:02:28.290> so<00:02:28.950> let's<00:02:29.160> back<00:02:29.490> up

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
those two components so let's back up

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.870 
those two components so let's back up
here<00:02:30.020> will<00:02:31.020> undo<00:02:31.050> that<00:02:31.530> so<00:02:31.830> it's<00:02:32.010> back<00:02:32.670> to<00:02:32.700> the

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
here will undo that so it's back to the

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.940 
here will undo that so it's back to the
original<00:02:33.330> position<00:02:33.510> what<00:02:34.290> if<00:02:34.380> we<00:02:34.530> wanted<00:02:34.830> a

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
original position what if we wanted a

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:36.530 
original position what if we wanted a
center-to-center<00:02:35.430> what<00:02:36.000> if<00:02:36.090> i<00:02:36.180> wanted<00:02:36.480> to

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
center-to-center what if i wanted to

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.810 
center-to-center what if i wanted to
constrain<00:02:37.050> it<00:02:37.200> to<00:02:37.230> the<00:02:37.530> center<00:02:37.920> of<00:02:37.950> this<00:02:38.490> shaft

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:38.820 
constrain it to the center of this shaft

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:41.720 
constrain it to the center of this shaft
we<00:02:39.720> may<00:02:39.870> want<00:02:40.050> to<00:02:40.200> turn<00:02:40.950> a<00:02:41.010> visibility<00:02:41.520> out

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
we may want to turn a visibility out

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.220 
we may want to turn a visibility out
there<00:02:42.000> so<00:02:42.180> we<00:02:42.240> can<00:02:42.390> see<00:02:42.510> the<00:02:42.600> shaft<00:02:42.870> a<00:02:43.020> little

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
there so we can see the shaft a little

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:47.060 
there so we can see the shaft a little
better<00:02:43.380> but<00:02:43.980> if<00:02:44.100> I<00:02:44.250> grab<00:02:44.520> my<00:02:44.550> Alt<00:02:44.940> key<00:02:46.070> you'll

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:47.070 
better but if I grab my Alt key you'll

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:48.710 
better but if I grab my Alt key you'll
notice<00:02:47.370> it's<00:02:47.520> doing<00:02:47.820> insert<00:02:48.300> now<00:02:48.480> there<00:02:48.630> are

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
notice it's doing insert now there are

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.630 
notice it's doing insert now there are
some<00:02:48.780> different<00:02:49.290> options<00:02:49.459> through<00:02:50.459> the

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
some different options through the

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.330 
some different options through the
ribbon<00:02:51.120> behavior<00:02:51.660> there's<00:02:52.590> some<00:02:52.830> changes

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
ribbon behavior there's some changes

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.400 
ribbon behavior there's some changes
that<00:02:53.550> in<00:02:53.760> the<00:02:54.180> past<00:02:54.360> you<00:02:54.600> could<00:02:54.720> hit<00:02:54.870> I<00:02:55.080> and<00:02:55.320> it

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
that in the past you could hit I and it

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:57.470 
that in the past you could hit I and it
would<00:02:55.560> cycle<00:02:55.830> over<00:02:56.250> to<00:02:56.459> an<00:02:56.610> insert<00:02:57.000> constraint

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
would cycle over to an insert constraint

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:58.970 
would cycle over to an insert constraint
right<00:02:57.630> now<00:02:57.750> it's<00:02:57.930> going<00:02:58.080> to<00:02:58.350> a<00:02:58.380> tangent

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
right now it's going to a tangent

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:00.830 
right now it's going to a tangent
something<00:02:59.730> that<00:02:59.850> we're<00:02:59.970> looking<00:03:00.360> at<00:03:00.570> but

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
something that we're looking at but

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.600 
something that we're looking at but
depending<00:03:01.320> on<00:03:01.440> what<00:03:01.709> you<00:03:01.830> select<00:03:02.280> you<00:03:02.459> can

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
depending on what you select you can

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:04.580 
depending on what you select you can
actually<00:03:02.940> get<00:03:03.090> different<00:03:03.390> types<00:03:03.750> of<00:03:03.900> geometry

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
actually get different types of geometry

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.100 
actually get different types of geometry
so<00:03:05.220> if<00:03:05.580> I<00:03:05.760> just<00:03:05.970> grab<00:03:06.239> that<00:03:06.450> edge<00:03:06.750> you'll

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 
so if I just grab that edge you'll

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:09.620 
so if I just grab that edge you'll
notice<00:03:07.410> that<00:03:07.440> it<00:03:07.650> gets<00:03:07.830> an<00:03:08.040> insert<00:03:08.489> if<00:03:09.180> I<00:03:09.360> move

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
notice that it gets an insert if I move

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:12.770 
notice that it gets an insert if I move
it<00:03:09.780> over<00:03:09.989> to<00:03:10.170> that<00:03:10.980> edge<00:03:11.250> it's<00:03:11.610> inserted<00:03:12.300> there

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
it over to that edge it's inserted there

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.100 
it over to that edge it's inserted there
and<00:03:13.020> then<00:03:13.620> if<00:03:14.040> we<00:03:14.640> wanted<00:03:14.970> to<00:03:15.030> add<00:03:15.540> a<00:03:15.570> flusher

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 
and then if we wanted to add a flusher

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:17.840 
and then if we wanted to add a flusher
another<00:03:16.560> constraint<00:03:17.040> we<00:03:17.220> could<00:03:17.400> do<00:03:17.519> that<00:03:17.640> as

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:17.850 
another constraint we could do that as

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:19.970 
another constraint we could do that as
well<00:03:17.880> so<00:03:18.299> the<00:03:19.140> great<00:03:19.350> thing<00:03:19.380> about<00:03:19.560> it<00:03:19.950> you

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
well so the great thing about it you

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.340 
well so the great thing about it you
just<00:03:20.190> hold<00:03:20.700> down<00:03:20.790> the<00:03:21.000> Alt<00:03:21.180> key<00:03:21.299> grab<00:03:22.080> the

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 
just hold down the Alt key grab the

some
surface<00:04:20.620> creation<00:04:21.220> and<00:04:21.370> a<00:04:21.430> few<00:04:21.609> other<00:04:21.759> things

so<00:04:22.419> in<00:04:22.690> the<00:04:22.870> future<00:04:23.229> podcast<00:04:23.889> is<00:04:24.099> something

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:24.370 
so in the future podcast is something

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:27.029 
so in the future podcast is something
that<00:04:24.460> I<00:04:24.520> anticipate<00:04:25.030> on<00:04:25.180> doing<00:04:25.539> as<00:04:26.379> always<00:04:26.860> if
