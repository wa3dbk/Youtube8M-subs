gecko enclosure or tub so I have a 16
cord<00:00:10.260> critter<00:00:10.950> keeper<00:00:11.160> I<00:00:11.429> think<00:00:11.700> and<00:00:12.450> as<00:00:12.960> a

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
cord critter keeper I think and as a

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.980 
cord critter keeper I think and as a
heat<00:00:13.290> source<00:00:13.530> I<00:00:13.799> just<00:00:14.009> use<00:00:14.160> a<00:00:14.280> heat<00:00:14.490> pad<00:00:14.990> it

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
heat source I just use a heat pad it

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.080 
heat source I just use a heat pad it
keeps<00:00:16.320> it<00:00:16.470> in<00:00:16.619> the<00:00:16.859> high<00:00:17.609> 70s<00:00:17.910> low<00:00:18.449> 80s<00:00:18.480> and

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:20.090 
keeps it in the high 70s low 80s and

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:26.089 
keeps it in the high 70s low 80s and
free<00:00:21.090> substrate<00:00:21.689> I<00:00:21.900> use<00:00:22.230> eco<00:00:22.680> earth<00:00:24.320> and<00:00:25.320> I

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
free substrate I use eco earth and I

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:31.490 
free substrate I use eco earth and I
just<00:00:26.310> put<00:00:26.490> moss<00:00:26.699> on<00:00:26.939> the<00:00:27.060> top<00:00:30.380> you're<00:00:31.380> gonna

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
just put moss on the top you're gonna

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:42.290 
just put moss on the top you're gonna
want<00:00:31.769> to<00:00:31.859> put<00:00:32.099> a<00:00:32.960> nice<00:00:33.960> inch<00:00:34.820> to<00:00:35.820> 2<00:00:36.090> inches

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:51.290 

so<00:00:43.300> that<00:00:43.510> should<00:00:43.719> be<00:00:43.750> enough<00:00:47.670> flatten<00:00:48.670> it<00:00:48.790> out

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:01:07.649 

it's<00:00:52.300> a<00:00:52.420> little<00:00:52.690> too<00:00:52.899> deep<00:01:06.030> so<00:01:07.030> I'm<00:01:07.150> gonna<00:01:07.330> pack

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:07.659 
it's a little too deep so I'm gonna pack

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:13.830 
it's a little too deep so I'm gonna pack
it<00:01:07.690> down<00:01:08.729> to<00:01:09.729> get<00:01:09.970> everything<00:01:12.450> like<00:01:13.450> stuff

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:13.840 
it down to get everything like stuff

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.940 
it down to get everything like stuff
together<00:01:14.080> and<00:01:15.270> then<00:01:16.270> I<00:01:16.720> just<00:01:17.050> like<00:01:17.320> to<00:01:17.740> go<00:01:17.920> over

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:17.950 
together and then I just like to go over

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:21.120 
together and then I just like to go over
it<00:01:18.399> with<00:01:18.520> a<00:01:18.759> little<00:01:19.030> layer<00:01:19.330> of<00:01:19.750> loss<00:01:20.070> so<00:01:21.070> it

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:21.130 
it with a little layer of loss so it

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:23.990 
it with a little layer of loss so it
keeps<00:01:21.490> in<00:01:21.759> the<00:01:21.789> humidity<00:01:22.270> very<00:01:23.170> well

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
keeps in the humidity very well

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.070 
keeps in the humidity very well
just<00:01:25.000> this<00:01:25.509> most<00:01:26.170> like<00:01:26.350> spyglass<00:01:27.070> I<00:01:27.250> think<00:01:28.080> so

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:29.080 
just this most like spyglass I think so

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:35.630 
just this most like spyglass I think so
you<00:01:29.140> put<00:01:30.039> that<00:01:30.070> in<00:01:32.729> like<00:01:33.729> that<00:01:33.759> and<00:01:34.300> then<00:01:34.780> just

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
you put that in like that and then just

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.249 
you put that in like that and then just
move<00:01:36.640> it<00:01:36.759> around<00:01:36.880> so<00:01:37.270> I<00:01:37.450> get<00:01:37.660> all<00:01:37.869> over<00:01:38.080> the

00:01:38.249 --> 00:01:38.259 
move it around so I get all over the

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:52.890 
move it around so I get all over the
time<00:01:39.270> break<00:01:40.270> it<00:01:40.450> up

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:52.900 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:58.170 

it<00:01:53.860> looks<00:01:54.100> big<00:01:54.580> now<00:01:54.910> but<00:01:55.390> once<00:01:55.600> it<00:01:55.810> gets<00:01:55.930> wet<00:01:57.180> it

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:58.180 
it looks big now but once it gets wet it

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:01.770 
it looks big now but once it gets wet it
goes<00:01:58.810> down<00:01:59.080> much<00:01:59.410> more<00:01:59.440> and<00:02:00.160> now<00:02:00.690> you're<00:02:01.690> gonna

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:01.780 
goes down much more and now you're gonna

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:05.480 
goes down much more and now you're gonna
want<00:02:02.110> some<00:02:02.880> perches<00:02:03.880> or<00:02:04.150> bamboo<00:02:04.570> so<00:02:04.870> I<00:02:04.900> just

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
want some perches or bamboo so I just

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.840 
want some perches or bamboo so I just
laid<00:02:06.490> them<00:02:06.730> across<00:02:07.000> like<00:02:07.390> that<00:02:07.660> I<00:02:08.490> have<00:02:09.490> two

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:09.850 
laid them across like that I have two

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:12.060 
laid them across like that I have two
ones<00:02:10.540> longer<00:02:11.050> than<00:02:11.200> the<00:02:11.320> other<00:02:11.470> so<00:02:11.590> I<00:02:11.770> could<00:02:11.980> go

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:12.070 
ones longer than the other so I could go

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:15.780 
ones longer than the other so I could go
like<00:02:12.250> this<00:02:12.460> with<00:02:12.730> it<00:02:13.680> so<00:02:14.680> it<00:02:14.830> goes<00:02:15.040> like<00:02:15.370> that

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
like this with it so it goes like that

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:22.830 
like this with it so it goes like that
and<00:02:16.120> then<00:02:18.300> to<00:02:19.300> ego<00:02:19.990> I<00:02:20.230> mean<00:02:20.890> to<00:02:21.840> exoteric

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
and then to ego I mean to exoteric

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:29.430 
and then to ego I mean to exoteric
plants<00:02:23.530> I<00:02:25.380> just<00:02:26.380> stick<00:02:26.650> onto<00:02:26.860> the<00:02:27.130> wall<00:02:28.440> watch

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
plants I just stick onto the wall watch

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:39.580 
plants I just stick onto the wall watch
