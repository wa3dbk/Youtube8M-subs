this<00:00:24.269> seed<00:00:24.480> is<00:00:24.660> I've<00:00:25.350> looked<00:00:25.500> around<00:00:25.619> it's<00:00:25.949> a

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
this seed is I've looked around it's a

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.500 
this seed is I've looked around it's a
pretty<00:00:26.189> good<00:00:26.369> seed<00:00:26.550> start<00:00:26.910> with<00:00:27.060> and<00:00:27.269> then<00:00:27.420> I

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
pretty good seed start with and then I

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.060 
pretty good seed start with and then I
said<00:00:27.779> to<00:00:27.930> make<00:00:28.019> it<00:00:28.170> really<00:00:28.410> cool<00:00:28.560> give<00:00:28.800> you<00:00:28.890> so

you know up strong incentive ation to

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.080 
you know up strong incentive ation to
use<00:00:30.840> it<00:00:30.990> is<00:00:31.109> I've<00:00:31.560> gone<00:00:31.740> and<00:00:31.949> I've<00:00:32.070> done<00:00:32.759> lots

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
of branch mine below ground you can

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.110 
of branch mine below ground you can
actually<00:00:34.350> see<00:00:34.590> example<00:00:35.070> of<00:00:35.130> it<00:00:35.219> down<00:00:35.309> here<00:00:35.579> so

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
actually see example of it down here so

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.190 
actually see example of it down here so
here's<00:00:36.270> some<00:00:36.420> diamond<00:00:36.750> core<00:00:36.899> nuts<00:00:37.079> again

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
here's some diamond core nuts again

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.450 
here's some diamond core nuts again
they'll<00:00:37.410> be<00:00:37.500> in<00:00:37.559> description<00:00:37.950> but<00:00:38.129> wive<00:00:38.250> done

they'll be in description but wive done

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.520 
they'll be in description but wive done
as<00:00:38.550> I<00:00:38.640> branched<00:00:38.879> my<00:00:39.090> bloke<00:00:39.390> ground<00:00:39.690> and<00:00:39.930> I

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
as I branched my bloke ground and I

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.530 
as I branched my bloke ground and I
found<00:00:40.829> just<00:00:41.250> all<00:00:41.700> the<00:00:41.910> diamonds<00:00:42.120> within

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
found just all the diamonds within

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.030 
found just all the diamonds within
certain<00:00:42.960> set<00:00:43.200> of<00:00:43.230> things<00:00:43.410> so<00:00:43.680> I<00:00:43.710> could<00:00:43.920> group

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
certain set of things so I could group

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.190 
certain set of things so I could group
them<00:00:44.100> together<00:00:44.370> so<00:00:45.239> you<00:00:45.300> could<00:00:45.450> get<00:00:45.539> so<00:00:46.110> you

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
them together so you could get so you

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.900 
them together so you could get so you
could<00:00:46.320> go<00:00:46.440> digging<00:00:46.920> and<00:00:47.100> get<00:00:47.280> diamonds<00:00:47.700> very

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
could go digging and get diamonds very

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.180 
could go digging and get diamonds very
very<00:00:48.270> very<00:00:48.450> quickly<00:00:48.750> like<00:00:49.110> a<00:00:49.289> CH<00:00:49.350> group<00:00:50.010> will

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
very very quickly like a CH group will

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.279 
very very quickly like a CH group will
take<00:00:50.340> you<00:00:50.489> maybe<00:00:50.730> three<00:00:51.449> four<00:00:51.750> minutes<00:00:51.899> so

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
take you maybe three four minutes so

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.470 
take you maybe three four minutes so
about<00:00:52.980> 15<00:00:53.489> minutes<00:00:53.820> and<00:00:54.059> you<00:00:54.120> could<00:00:54.300> have<00:00:54.420> a

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
about 15 minutes and you could have a

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.290 
about 15 minutes and you could have a
over<00:00:54.930> 100<00:00:55.260> diamonds<00:00:55.610> 105<00:00:56.610> diamonds<00:00:57.059> I<00:00:57.120> believe

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.160 
n axis so the axe is going this way
which<00:01:20.040> is<00:01:20.220> pretty<00:01:20.640> cool<00:01:20.820> the<00:01:21.330> excess<00:01:21.659> yeah

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
which is pretty cool the excess yeah

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.890 
which is pretty cool the excess yeah
there's<00:01:22.350> an<00:01:22.409> axis<00:01:22.710> so<00:01:23.150> again<00:01:24.150> that's<00:01:24.299> these

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
there's an axis so again that's these

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.450 
there's an axis so again that's these
these<00:01:25.170> are<00:01:25.350> the<00:01:25.439> groups<00:01:25.650> there's<00:01:26.070> poor<00:01:26.310> from

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
these are the groups there's poor from

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:27.770 
these are the groups there's poor from
right<00:01:26.670> here<00:01:26.850> as<00:01:26.939> you<00:01:27.000> can<00:01:27.060> see<00:01:27.210> yeah<00:01:27.600> there's

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
right here as you can see yeah there's

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.929 
right here as you can see yeah there's
another<00:01:27.990> two<00:01:28.259> on<00:01:28.290> the<00:01:28.439> head<00:01:28.560> over<00:01:28.680> here<00:01:28.920> and<00:01:29.040> if

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
another two on the head over here and if

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:30.980 
another two on the head over here and if
you<00:01:30.000> look<00:01:30.090> up<00:01:30.270> that<00:01:30.329> little<00:01:30.659> further<00:01:30.810> over

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
you look up that little further over

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.840 
you look up that little further over
this<00:01:31.110> way<00:01:31.350> so<00:01:31.380> as<00:01:31.619> you<00:01:31.710> can<00:01:31.799> see<00:01:31.860> it's<00:01:32.159> a<00:01:32.369> fair

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
this way so as you can see it's a fair

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.030 
this way so as you can see it's a fair
distance<00:01:33.210> this<00:01:33.450> way<00:01:33.509> once<00:01:34.350> you<00:01:34.470> do<00:01:34.590> get<00:01:34.770> from

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
distance this way once you do get from

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.679 
distance this way once you do get from
each<00:01:35.130> one<00:01:35.280> to<00:01:35.430> the<00:01:35.520> other<00:01:35.549> it's<00:01:36.000> just<00:01:36.270> a<00:01:36.420> really

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
each one to the other it's just a really

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.510 
each one to the other it's just a really
short<00:01:36.990> distance<00:01:37.470> from<00:01:37.590> one<00:01:37.740> set<00:01:38.040> of<00:01:38.100> dynasty

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
short distance from one set of dynasty

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.130 
short distance from one set of dynasty
ever<00:01:38.640> and<00:01:39.360> then<00:01:39.479> over<00:01:39.659> here<00:01:39.689> there's<00:01:39.900> number

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
ever and then over here there's number

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.390 
ever and then over here there's number
four<00:01:40.170> and<00:01:40.650> then<00:01:40.740> just<00:01:40.950> towards<00:01:41.130> the<00:01:41.220> edge<00:01:41.310> to

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
four and then just towards the edge to

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.920 
four and then just towards the edge to
the<00:01:41.490> map<00:01:41.610> again<00:01:41.759> under<00:01:42.090> water<00:01:42.270> so<00:01:42.390> it's<00:01:42.630> a<00:01:42.689> tiny

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
the map again under water so it's a tiny

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.630 
the map again under water so it's a tiny
bit<00:01:43.049> hard<00:01:43.229> to<00:01:43.290> get<00:01:43.470> to<00:01:43.649> but<00:01:44.340> then<00:01:44.460> there's

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
bit hard to get to but then there's

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.069 
bit hard to get to but then there's
another<00:01:44.670> five<00:01:45.090> over<00:01:45.360> here<00:01:45.540> so<00:01:45.780> there's<00:01:46.020> a

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
another five over here so there's a

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.350 
another five over here so there's a
hundred<00:01:46.560> and<00:01:46.799> five<00:01:47.189> diamonds<00:01:47.579> total<00:01:48.090> to<00:01:48.270> be

hundred and five diamonds total to be

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.999 
hundred and five diamonds total to be
found<00:01:48.600> from<00:01:48.780> just<00:01:49.200> the<00:01:49.320> diamond<00:01:49.619> coins<00:01:49.829> from

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
found from just the diamond coins from

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.800 
found from just the diamond coins from
there<00:01:50.189> there<00:01:50.790> obviously<00:01:51.000> was<00:01:51.119> there<00:01:51.360> is<00:01:51.450> a<00:01:51.570> lot

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.870 
links but freedom and so you can make a
pickaxe<00:02:36.570> right<00:02:37.560> from<00:02:37.740> to<00:02:37.980> get<00:02:38.130> get<00:02:38.520> go<00:02:38.640> if<00:02:38.760> you

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
pickaxe right from to get get go if you

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:39.980 
pickaxe right from to get get go if you
really<00:02:38.940> want<00:02:39.210> to<00:02:39.330> so<00:02:39.510> you<00:02:39.540> can<00:02:39.690> mine<00:02:39.900> the
