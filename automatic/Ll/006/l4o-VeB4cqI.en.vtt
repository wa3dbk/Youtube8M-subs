00:03:58.820 --> 00:03:58.830 
one on this side is a it didn't come up

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:02.300 
one on this side is a it didn't come up
too<00:03:59.580> easy<00:03:59.760> we<00:04:00.660> had<00:04:00.810> to<00:04:00.900> put<00:04:01.620> it<00:04:01.740> up<00:04:01.890> and<00:04:02.100> then

too easy we had to put it up and then

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:04.340 
too easy we had to put it up and then
the<00:04:02.520> pooled<00:04:03.060> and<00:04:03.360> push<00:04:03.540> the<00:04:03.720> button<00:04:03.990> so<00:04:04.260> it
