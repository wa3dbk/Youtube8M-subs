00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:06.510
 and 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:28.590
 very good to all welcome to pvp in 

00:00:26.399 --> 00:00:31.050
 new tutorials and today I bring you a 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.239
 terrific tutorial for our mobiles 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.699
 for our android systems or tablet 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:41.430
 it is nothing more and nothing less than who 

00:00:35.699 --> 00:00:45.479
 master is like let's say a tunnel tools 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:47.899
 of pc is to optimize our our 

00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:52.000
 mobile our android our tablet 

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:55.030
 freeing memory by deleting files 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.500
 that occupy memory and the mobile takes 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:01:00.370
 a little bit at a time to navigate or 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:03.730
 move from one place to another in order 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:06.880
 it's totally free, you can 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:09.130
 find in this sector is in 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:12.890
 prehistory I think it's prehistory it 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:17.210
 call we give you to look here 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:22.820
 and we can create master here we do not have 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:24.110
 nothing we install it, we accept it, it is 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:29.259
 quickie 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:31.729
 are 9 megas passionate then inside 

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:36.340
 this program of this application we have 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:40.180
 several more options that we can apply 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:42.200
 with him to optimize more our 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:45.040
 our good android system i'm going 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.040
 to teach here how is 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:52.260
 so I'm going to start it and then 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.260
 put maximum screen 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:55.930
 it does not let me 

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:03.830
 well here we have it maximizes the place 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:11.220
 well do not give me more initial we 'll see if 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:13.020
 do not enlarge it good here as you can 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:16.410
 watch 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:20.280
 is using 15 gb of memory in 3 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:23.780
 % 64 this comes to me here because a 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.780
 application that I have it in 

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:30.460
 let's say that 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:31.900
 in windows it's worth but it's simple for 

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:35.320
 optimize we go to the section of 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:38.230
 memory policy we give you here puts 

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:42.200
 what you are using and here we see in 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:44.629
 the memory that the program is using 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:47.120
 that is pulling memory is being 

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:48.890
 memory of our android and the only 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:52.220
 we have to optimize them 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:54.349
 it only optimizes and frees it 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:56.510
 automatically a young man has released the 

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:59.239
 12% of true ram memory that means 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:01.790
 that now go by 12% faster 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:03.349
 Then you see how I decide there are some 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:06.709
 applications that you can install 

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:09.230
 about about this master class application 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:12.430
 for example this browser I have it 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:16.280
 on the mobile and it goes three times faster 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:19.760
 that the google chrome at least in the 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:21.890
 mobile and it is totally free good 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:23.630
 this is to optimize then file 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:26.060
 trash this also an option that I 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:27.260
 I do a lot because the mobile without using it 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:30.040
 a lot of whatsapp 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:34.880
 facebook internet etcetera etcetera 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:38.360
 takes a lot of memory and truth that 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:40.200
 is memory is being used and meg 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:45.370
 your ram memory 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:48.069
 behind the sd card by the face as 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:51.870
 I say because they are files that 

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:54.760
 they install automatically and we can not 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:56.560
 remove the milestones in this way then 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:58.060
 we give him clean garbage and he also 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:00.549
 automatically we clean all the 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:03.340
 trash that is using us 

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:04.959
 although we want to remove some that do not 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:08.379
 it interests you to be able to check the boxes 

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:10.840
 Well, you also have more options here, 

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:13.180
 it does not appear to us but what is in the 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:16.260
 mobile has other options like 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:18.500
 lanterns as he puts lantern 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:20.340
 and I 'm telling you to manage the applications 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:21.990
 really with an antivirus that I 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:25.410
 I also put it with this program and the 

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:27.470
 mobile very very very very fluid I'm going the 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:30.620
 double fast 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:32.660
 but in applications here we can 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:35.300
 install this the applications that the 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:37.610
 that we want good I just 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:39.290
 I have all these but on our mobile 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:41.390
 then you will have all of you 

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:43.130
 you have how you can download the 

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:46.550
 applications are not directly provided 

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:50.960
 back to the projectors here we can 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:54.200
 make many many options now this 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:56.780
 it's all I hope you like me 

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:59.360
 doing this because I find it more 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:01.910
 easy doing it with your mobile and 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:03.560
 you see it already directly me to this 

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:05.900
 application that I have here that also 

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:07.610
 we hit you and I did it too 

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:10.040
 in another video tutorial that I have in 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:12.440
 my channel super new tutorials and nothing 

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:16.000
 this is all I hope it serves you 

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:16.000
 help and we already know
