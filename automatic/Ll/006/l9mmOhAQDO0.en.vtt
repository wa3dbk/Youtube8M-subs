really just an artistic finished the

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:32.810 
really just an artistic finished the
real<00:03:29.519> point<00:03:29.760> is<00:03:30.650> to<00:03:31.650> spray<00:03:31.890> the<00:03:32.040> guitar<00:03:32.340> at<00:03:32.760> the

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
same stuff that they use in the 50s

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:35.900

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
which would eventually kind of wear off

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:37.940 
which would eventually kind of wear off
and<00:03:36.180> the<00:03:36.660> wood<00:03:36.840> would<00:03:37.019> solidify<00:03:37.350> a<00:03:37.620> little
