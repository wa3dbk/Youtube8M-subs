00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 the staff all good do not aggravate one more 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:07.109
 video here plus a doubts function 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:08.160
 You guys have a question. 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:10.170
 that I was found very interesting 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.830
 to record a video specifically for 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.509
 that 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.150
 it is a doubt about the 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.949
 is asking here is mine. 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.020
 dog I have to change the action 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.730
 every time the comparison with 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:24.630
 different coloring my sick dog 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.800
 very fast of reason is is one thing is 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.510
 a doubt that I believe is 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.279
 frequent it is very common in the 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.520
 The staff also asks this a lot. 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:34.469
 people who why dog ​​nauseates your dog 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.559
 really in very fast action game 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:39.180
 no, it's not really 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.710
 really some dogs that played a lot 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.600
 Fast right feed 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:46.170
 but I would say that most 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:48.870
 cases and about 80% of the cases the 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.180
 What do we do with this reason? 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.039
 which is wrong so fashion a lot of people 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.440
 governs the reason that we educate the 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.480
 our dog is what makes you stay 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.430
 this charm this morning of not wanting 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.739
 eat that action there are not some 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.449
 some animals that have silver 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.700
 skill that really 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.500
 end up rejecting and ends up getting very sick 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.810
 But I would tell you that 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.510
 the minority is few cars and as the 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.860
 people detect this because most of the 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.140
 dogs that people say it to me 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.180
 I ask the question if this field he 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.909
 Is there any adjustment whatsoever if it already 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.470
 made a basic adjustment, right? 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:24.090
 Most people say they never 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.770
 did a basic training never did 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.930
 no teaching control has no 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:31.229
 command with this tone does not know if 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:33.750
 sit lie paw south is the the 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.670
 word 'no' and has neither command nor 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.189
 so it was in the case of how 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.689
 lived with the family and how he 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:41.400
 lived with the family he finishes 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:43.350
 learning to do some 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:46.860
 requests to us he ends up learning 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:48.299
 to ask for what he wants is a way that 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.759
 he realizes that he can call 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:52.860
 our attention is through reason if he 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:54.720
 Do not eat immediately when 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.610
 people puts and ends up calling our 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.740
 Attention, we end up feeling 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.430
 bothered with the one going there to try 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.070
 link 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.840
 the action so then this dog it finishes 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.550
 feeling stimulated by change because 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.900
 it feels like it's a care that 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:08.910
 Are you having with him put some 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:10.289
 thing with a different smell such is the 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.720
 main is that when he asks for petiz 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:15.090
 that you end up not giving a charm that 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.920
 end up doing is really to ask for 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:18.990
 swap ulama from that hunger strike 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.340
 go there and I will not eat until I know 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:23.100
 the name of something else but her 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.570
 It was a good thing, and there it is. 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.950
 with which owners who do not have 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:28.860
 both knowledge of dressage 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:30.959
 canine end up your dogs years old with 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.270
 others with other things right? 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:35.940
 other things as it goes with that broth 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:38.100
 of competitive meat at home 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.560
 I had canned meat on those axes 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:42.930
 cookies the same food 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.320
 carninha human one and a chicken thing and 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.720
 such 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:47.430
 so you end up hooking this dog with others 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:49.470
 food cisterns for that dog 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.910
 As a nation, we bring something. 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:52.500
 different to make it more palatable 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:54.959
 so that he really like it 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.940
 the same the case of this owner ends up 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:58.709
 exchanging feed monthly now 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:01.020
 almost a week later when it starts 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:03.180
 I do not eat anymore, and this is actually 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:05.670
 a much more education issue of this 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.709
 dog than simply exchange 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:10.650
 action, I've already commented in the other video 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:12.420
 is that the dogs they have very little 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:13.650
 palatability is compared to being 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:18.450
 human being 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:20.519
 it has about 80% - of taste 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:22.350
 right then that is they do not feel much 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:24.989
 I like them, they smell a lot more. 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:27.630
 they have is much more advanced fact 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:29.790
 with humans but it is the palate in the 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:31.620
 However, if not so much by taste 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:33.060
 but by the really attractive smell that 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:35.280
 make this dog want to eat 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:38.040
 food more smelly more seasoned 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:38.910
 then this the girl but this dog is but not 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.920
 by the palate 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:42.090
 so it's much more so by the way 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:44.430
 with which we manage this reason 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:47.340
 change if you're right you leave 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:48.930
 it's will every day is a case that 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:50.760
 can take stand to make this strike of 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:52.470
 hunger does not want to feed and that 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:54.120
 asked a different reason, right? 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:56.070
 if the handle we go there we leaving 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:58.560
 the action the will to put the thinkpad 

00:03:56.070 --> 00:04:00.840
 I put a full pot and leave it in the morning. 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:02.280
 to take the afternoon but you put a 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:04.530
 pot filled with the amount he 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:05.400
 want to eat is a way that he can 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:07.019
 to lie 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:09.450
 the war of form I tell you that 

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:11.220
 80% of dogs that end up not wanting 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:12.810
 eat the ration is because we were 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:14.760
 leaving in relation to the will 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:16.350
 so that is why every year so 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:18.359
 he really does this hunger strike 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:19.579
 to me because if I really get there 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:22.380
 and put the set time 

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:24.930
 controlled feed amount and 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:27.210
 Understand to eat the ration at the right time. 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:28.949
 the correct way then your custom 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:31.080
 place 7 am putting it to 

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:34.770
 continue to rise and 300 grams 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:37.470
 the pot 150 grams 150 grams in the morning 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:38.760
 put the minute and took that pot arrives 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:40.500
 in the late afternoon at six o'clock 

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:43.490
 more or less puts you can not anymore 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:47.430
 150 grams to 300 grams per day 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:49.199
 put in another time and if he can 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:50.910
 obligatorily he tends to start it 

00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:56.550
 do not eat in the morning he will be without 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:58.620
 eat all day afternoon has to eat 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:00.510
 morning so most of the dogs they 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:02.910
 adapt very well to this and has a 

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:04.349
 correct feeding routine right we 

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:06.270
 hardly have animals that really 

00:05:04.349 --> 00:05:08.280
 will get addicted to food 

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:10.080
 wanting to ask for something different or not 

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:12.810
 wanting to eat the food okay 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:14.760
 most of the cases that I have resolved 

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:15.990
 here at the clinic when the client starts 

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:18.419
 to put a limit on the appropriate amount 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:20.010
 ideal reason to be solved thus 

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:21.120
 these problems because we know that 

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:23.370
 We keep changing our food. 

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:25.139
 periodically very frequent people 

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:27.330
 ends up not being able to maintain a flora 

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:29.190
 practice proper bowel us 

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:31.110
 the digestibility decreases they stay 

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:32.669
 decrease the absorption of nutrients or 

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:35.310
 Are we losing quality? 

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:38.190
 our field of nutrition and maintains 

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:40.409
 a single reason makes it continuous and is e 

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:43.139
 I had to do it that way, people. 

00:05:40.409 --> 00:05:45.210
 with respect to education in the dog 

00:05:43.139 --> 00:05:47.430
 dog that knows how to obey us know the word 

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:49.260
 no he knows sits right off the 

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:51.599
 basic commands step my hierarchy 

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:54.330
 of the house know who is sending here as 

00:05:51.599 --> 00:05:55.800

 channel that already scheduled I commented to 

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:58.680
 respect to this, then watch others 

00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:00.300
 videos that you will be able to give 

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:02.580
