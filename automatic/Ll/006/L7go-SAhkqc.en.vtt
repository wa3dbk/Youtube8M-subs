00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.759
 against all odds, marco van den berg knew the center as well as the injured man 

00:00:03.759 --> 00:00:06.939
 arrived and it can't be different or active just before the game suddenly 

00:00:06.939 --> 00:00:10.450
 with his newborn son to the hospital had to have an operation 

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:13.829
 operation that luckily went well 

00:00:13.829 --> 00:00:17.159
 I led the ox at rest with 43 34 

00:00:17.159 --> 00:00:20.289
 this is the third quarter with the score of mensvoort the brainport 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:24.890
 the difference is eleven points 45 34 for keppels 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.160
 then comes back again thanks to Marcus Jackson 

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:33.840
 the score and it's 49 48 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.840
 and this keeps the always close to cap the ols 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:39.270
 but the craft 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.230
 torri tamils ​​to brainport 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:45.560
 and the delicious opinion 

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:49.680
 54 51 and so there is also something to enjoy in martiniplaza 

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:56.580
 because bas rozendaal is also possible 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:00:59.070
 the second dump 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.180
 behind each other 56 51 the lead 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:05.489
 the weather stays in the neighborhood 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.980
 weather Marcus Jackson 

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:09.880
 eighteen points total 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.880
 and the lead even prevents 60 58 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.860
 thank us we meet them again jackson away 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.910
 the difference is again 6 in favor of peppen met the 66 60 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:28.620
 and now I have to hold on to that or that lead 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:31.440
 claims has a very good distance shooter 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:34.440
 stivoro was scores 25 points 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.250
 this is one of his three-pointers the difference is again 3 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.680
 to the good rebound of keppels foursome 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:44.970
 time the ball with Jansen too 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.970
 at the week the ox still has to walk a bit again in weather 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:52.030
 we are in the last minutes of the game 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.630
 there are also many struggles and both sides 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:58.040
 crazy about storm 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.830
 Thomas is the winner 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:02.960
 has a roadside fire bank 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.920
 his toes are twentieth point and the difference is 8 74 66 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.979
 and now the game must be decided 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:14.739
 is not just there he is again stivoro as 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:20.299
 and so the difference is again 3 we are going to have a very exciting final phase in it's 74 

00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:21.779
 72 

00:02:21.779 --> 00:02:24.449
 thomas missed shot 

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:27.449
 and again time as much as 15 seconds to come next to us 

00:02:28.529 --> 00:02:30.589
 we see the duel between this and that 

00:02:30.589 --> 00:02:33.479
 the game distributor of waving and how much sun whiting 

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:36.259
 Jan Smith naturally goes for the score 

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:38.049
 sows afterwards 

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:42.659
 but he knew the rebound was going and this will still be us with 74 

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:44.209
 72 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:47.959
 I have it after us Amsterdam is the best of the rest and so is Marco van 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:49.360
 the mountain a satisfied coach 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:54.750
 because needed if you still poke a little reported but especially two left 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:58.310
 it partly extends from us players to real functioning as a unit 

00:02:59.089 --> 00:03:01.209
 that is very good the game can be much better 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:07.419
 I'm doing very well, Granero, two weeks north of Nijmegen 

00:03:07.419 --> 00:03:09.189
 so I think we 

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:14.739
 be able to continue tons in a list of honors to approaching Christmas 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:18.389
 to see on January 3 next year what more will be achieved 

00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:21.799
 if i'm playing it home at number three he translated spits the bunch
