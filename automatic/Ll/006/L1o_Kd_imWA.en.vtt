00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:05.580
 this is a brain model filled 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.060
 gelatin red dye marked 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.280
 corpse 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.500
 scholar vanderbilt university 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.809
 use this model for testing 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.269
 robot equipped with a moving needle 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.460
 which could without tissue damage 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.529
 brain remove thrombus if this 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.750
 The experiment will pass successfully chance 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:24.240
 saving many critical patients 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.609
 able to dramatically increase the professor 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:31.650
 engineering robert webster personally 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:33.000
 interested in the success of developing this 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.550
 concerns me personally 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.530
 my father was diagnosed with a throne 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.260
 brain and a few more years 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.719
 back adequate treatments just 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.329
 there was no father and roberto webster 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:47.550
 survived however 40 percent of patients with 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:50.160
 this diagnosis die according to the doctor 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.079
 kayla weaver neurosurgeons team 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.670
 webster doctors have not so much 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.789
 tools in the arsenal of combat 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.699
 blood clots of tanks and moans and armies 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:01.140
 very often due to anatomical 

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:03.420
 features of the location of blood 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.820
 vessels and the process of development of this 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.400
 diseases of blood clots are in the depths 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.770
 brain tissue and there is a fear that 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.619
 the operation can do even more harm 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.600
 than the very existence of this mass this 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.430
 the robot is equipped with a number of flexible thin 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.619
 metal tubes driven 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.330
 computer professor webster notes 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.080
 that surgeons will be able to scan the brain 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.909
 patient 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.070
 and then the computer will make a map 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.020
 optimal access to tube tramp 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.960
 will be able to move around fragile tissues 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.850
 brain they are through them scientists are working on 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.009
 creating nozzles for this robot 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.350
 for example forceps that could 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:39.630
 crush the throne before removing it from the fabric 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.640
 the brain of the robot has yet to 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.470
 get tested get necessary 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.750
 permission before it enters 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.340
 operating developers hope that 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:51.649
 when this process is complete 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.649
 surgeons will be able to save lives more often
