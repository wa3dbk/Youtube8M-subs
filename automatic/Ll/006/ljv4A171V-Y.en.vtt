00:00:03.589 --> 00:00:08.040
 hello girls welcome to the channel today you 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:10.019
 I'm going to teach how to make eyebrows 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.840
 degraded with a little more effect 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:15.120
 dramatic this technique I just 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:18.330
 learn because the other techniques that 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:21.720
 I had and the ones I used did not let me 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:24.689
 this result but I have already learned to 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.640
 do it well and quickly and what 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.099
 first thing we're going to need is a 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.349
 first this is for the moment that if 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.550
 you're going out in the night or something will last you 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:36.170
 your eyebrow 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.170
 intact in that position 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:41.120
 then with a brush we comb 

00:00:39.769 --> 00:00:43.280
 our eyebrows 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:46.129
 I'm going to use this visual quartet 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:49.070
 which is number 28 and I'm going to take this 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:51.860
 shadow that is the most clear of this 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:54.860
 quartet is mate completely I'm going to 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:56.839
 use a brush of this type you 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:59.960
 can use the brush that most 

00:00:56.839 --> 00:01:02.390
 like for your eyebrow and I'm going to start 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:04.369
 place the shadow on the part of 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:06.470
 in front of our brows trying to 

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:10.420
 to go to the same address as 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:10.420
 our beautiful 

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:15.890
 and then I'm going to drink this coffee a little 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:17.860
 darker that comes in the same palette 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:21.010
 and I'm going to put it 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:23.880
 in this part of the eyebrows arriving 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:23.880
 to the piquito 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:29.409
 and where does the cut with the other 

00:01:26.829 --> 00:01:32.170
 color let's go blurring so that it 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:34.899
 go losing the line after I take a 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:36.819
 pencil in dark brown tone and this one what 

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:39.270
 I'm going to do is draw the little piquito that 

00:01:36.819 --> 00:01:39.270
 subtraction 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:46.560
 and with the same brush 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:49.320
 we are degrading the line that was left here 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:53.100
 with a black shadow that is wet with 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.670
 drops for the eyes we will take with 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.430
 another brush 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:59.950
 preferably this if it is so 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:02.920
 angular to have much better precision 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:07.049
 and what we are going to do is go drawing 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.049
 the tail of our eyebrow 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:16.850
 making a line here from the middle 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.850
 Towards what is the piquito 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:22.069
 and who is also 

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:29.640
 and we go back to take the coffee shade more 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:33.380
 dark of the quartet and we blur what 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.380
 what's left in this part 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:40.130
 now I'm going to take a proofreader and I'm going 

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:40.130
 to put on the bottom 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:47.410
 this is to correct the parts where 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:49.870
 we went over the pitch 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:52.450
 and the for the and to define the part of 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:55.090
 face can use the same color of 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:57.040
 your base or in my case I will be 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:01.610
 using this tone that is a bit more 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:03.440
 strong that also use it as a base 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:05.590
 and I put it in the part here in without 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:05.590
 plus 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:10.950
 and he marked my eyebrows very well as the 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:10.950
 I want 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:16.050
 and you can do the gradient in 

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:17.910
 the tones that you like 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:19.800
 if they want to lower the intensity 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:22.800
 using black they can use a 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:24.900
 dark brown color and good girls like that are 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:28.140
 how are our brows already degraded 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:29.910
 and I hope you like this video and if 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:31.770
 have any doubt suggestion or 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:35.760
 comment here shortly I can 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:39.709
 leave in the comments box and we 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.709
 we see in a next video bye bye
