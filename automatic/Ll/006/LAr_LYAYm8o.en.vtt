00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:28.820 
and see how that looks so here we go

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:34.980 
and see how that looks so here we go
so<00:01:29.820> this<00:01:30.030> is

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:34.990 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:46.469 

the<00:01:35.990> Paragon

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:46.479 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:49.170 

and<00:01:46.689> this<00:01:47.409> is<00:01:47.560> pretty<00:01:48.189> work<00:01:48.520> but<00:01:48.729> of<00:01:48.789> course<00:01:49.000> I

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:49.180 
and this is pretty work but of course I

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:56.609 
and this is pretty work but of course I
just<00:01:49.479> dipped<00:01:49.780> it<00:01:55.170> certainly<00:01:56.170> seems<00:01:56.380> to<00:01:56.439> be<00:01:56.530> a

00:01:56.609 --> 00:01:56.619 
just dipped it certainly seems to be a

00:01:56.619 --> 00:01:57.810 
just dipped it certainly seems to be a
bit<00:01:56.770> of<00:01:56.860> distinction<00:01:57.369> here<00:01:57.490> between<00:01:57.520> the

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:57.820 
bit of distinction here between the

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:05.410 
bit of distinction here between the
downstroke<00:01:58.420> and<00:01:58.689> the<00:01:58.929> diagonal

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:11.710 

there<00:02:06.420> we<00:02:06.539> go<00:02:06.719> so<00:02:07.469> that's<00:02:07.859> the<00:02:08.099> paragon<00:02:08.640> of

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.030 

course<00:02:12.720> doing<00:02:12.959> this<00:02:13.080> sort<00:02:13.290> of<00:02:13.470> test<00:02:13.739> is<00:02:13.890> always

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
course doing this sort of test is always

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.309 
course doing this sort of test is always
better<00:02:14.310> waste<00:02:14.640> of<00:02:14.879> time<00:02:15.150> because<00:02:15.599> there<00:02:16.200> are

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 
better waste of time because there are

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:19.900 
better waste of time because there are
so<00:02:16.530> many<00:02:16.560> things<00:02:17.040> that<00:02:17.190> will<00:02:17.430> affect<00:02:18.560> the

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
so many things that will affect the

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:22.430 
so many things that will affect the
broadness<00:02:20.910> of<00:02:21.269> the<00:02:21.330> line<00:02:21.569> the<00:02:21.720> flexibility<00:02:22.379> of

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
broadness of the line the flexibility of

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.479 
broadness of the line the flexibility of
amid<00:02:22.860> the<00:02:23.040> negative<00:02:23.519> Peaks<00:02:24.860> the<00:02:25.860> width<00:02:26.129> of<00:02:26.310> the

amid the negative Peaks the width of the

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:27.979 
amid the negative Peaks the width of the
nib<00:02:26.640> will<00:02:26.790> make<00:02:26.970> a<00:02:27.000> difference<00:02:27.540> the<00:02:27.720> way<00:02:27.840> it's

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:27.989 
nib will make a difference the way it's

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:29.809 
nib will make a difference the way it's
actually<00:02:28.140> tipped<00:02:28.709> the<00:02:28.950> anklet<00:02:29.310> which<00:02:29.459> is<00:02:29.610> home

00:02:29.809 --> 00:02:29.819 
actually tipped the anklet which is home

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:34.580 
actually tipped the anklet which is home
to<00:02:29.849> the<00:02:30.060> paper<00:02:30.629> all<00:02:31.140> sorts<00:02:31.769> of<00:02:31.860> things<00:02:32.190> so<00:02:33.590> your

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
to the paper all sorts of things so your

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:45.050 
to the paper all sorts of things so your
sense

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.839 

this<00:02:45.660> is<00:02:45.840> a<00:02:45.870> bit<00:02:46.020> of<00:02:46.080> a<00:02:46.140> waste<00:02:46.380> of<00:02:46.620> time

00:02:47.839 --> 00:02:47.849 
this is a bit of a waste of time

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:50.690 
this is a bit of a waste of time
but<00:02:48.719> again<00:02:49.230> it<00:02:49.560> is<00:02:49.739> giving<00:02:50.069> us<00:02:50.159> I<00:02:50.370> think<00:02:50.430> the

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
but again it is giving us I think the

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.940 
but again it is giving us I think the
difficult<00:02:51.090> indication<00:02:51.780> that<00:02:52.439> there<00:02:52.680> is<00:02:52.769> not<00:02:52.920> a

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
difficult indication that there is not a

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:54.800 
difficult indication that there is not a
looking<00:02:53.489> different<00:02:53.969> sphere<00:02:54.269> and<00:02:54.569> then<00:02:54.719> the

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
looking different sphere and then the

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:17.639 
personal favorites you know the paper

00:03:17.639 --> 00:03:19.970 
personal favorites you know the paper
I'm<00:03:17.790> using<00:03:17.819> by<00:03:18.299> the<00:03:18.359> way<00:03:18.540> is<00:03:18.749> crown<00:03:19.230> Mills<00:03:19.650> of

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
I'm using by the way is crown Mills of

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:28.849 
I'm using by the way is crown Mills of
the<00:03:20.099> vellum<00:03:21.319> okay<00:03:22.319> so<00:03:22.379> this<00:03:22.590> is<00:03:22.799> sailor<00:03:27.859> King

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:28.859 
the vellum okay so this is sailor King

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:31.369 
the vellum okay so this is sailor King
pens<00:03:29.340> this<00:03:29.790> also<00:03:30.090> has<00:03:30.419> a<00:03:30.449> broad<00:03:30.750> nib<00:03:31.109> but<00:03:31.319> I

00:03:31.369 --> 00:03:31.379 
pens this also has a broad nib but I

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:33.099 
pens this also has a broad nib but I
think<00:03:31.560> it's<00:03:31.709> fairly<00:03:31.919> clear<00:03:32.310> that

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:33.109 
think it's fairly clear that

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:36.830 
think it's fairly clear that
unsurprisingly<00:03:34.909> this<00:03:35.909> broad<00:03:36.329> nib<00:03:36.629> is

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
unsurprisingly this broad nib is

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.649 
unsurprisingly this broad nib is
probably<00:03:37.169> more<00:03:37.319> like<00:03:37.560> a<00:03:37.590> European<00:03:38.180> medium<00:03:39.180> and

00:03:39.649 --> 00:03:39.659 
probably more like a European medium and

00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:43.119 
probably more like a European medium and
it's<00:03:39.959> significantly<00:03:40.819> filer<00:03:41.819> and<00:03:42.209> either<00:03:42.629> the

00:03:43.119 --> 00:03:43.129 
it's significantly filer and either the

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:50.470 
it's significantly filer and either the
Paragon<00:03:44.129> older<00:03:44.699> Pelican<00:03:45.150> so<00:03:45.870> there<00:03:46.049> we<00:03:46.230> go

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:50.480 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:52.630 

not<00:03:51.110> a<00:03:51.140> huge<00:03:51.470> amount<00:03:51.590> of<00:03:51.890> difference<00:03:52.370> and<00:03:52.550> this

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:52.640 
not a huge amount of difference and this

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:55.210 
not a huge amount of difference and this
really<00:03:52.910> is<00:03:53.060> a<00:03:53.090> round<00:03:53.390> tip<00:03:53.920> so<00:03:54.920> there's<00:03:55.069> not<00:03:55.160> a

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:55.220 
really is a round tip so there's not a

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:56.170 
really is a round tip so there's not a
huge<00:03:55.370> amount<00:03:55.520> of<00:03:55.700> difference<00:03:56.030> actually

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:56.180 
huge amount of difference actually

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:58.449 
huge amount of difference actually
between<00:03:56.569> naturals<00:03:57.260> and<00:03:57.560> Euler's<00:03:57.920> come<00:03:58.130> and

00:03:58.449 --> 00:03:58.459 
between naturals and Euler's come and

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:03.640 
between naturals and Euler's come and
see<00:03:58.670> you

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:03.650 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:06.020 

obviously<00:04:04.650> it's<00:04:04.770> putting<00:04:05.030> significantly

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.030 
obviously it's putting significantly

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:08.750 
obviously it's putting significantly
less<00:04:06.240> incoming<00:04:06.690> page<00:04:06.930> so<00:04:07.890> getting<00:04:08.340> much<00:04:08.550> more

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
less incoming page so getting much more

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:15.470 
less incoming page so getting much more
to<00:04:08.970> come<00:04:09.150> okay<00:04:10.520> so<00:04:11.520> so<00:04:12.030> far<00:04:12.060> so<00:04:12.720> good<00:04:14.060> if<00:04:15.060> I<00:04:15.270> was

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:15.480 
to come okay so so far so good if I was

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:18.440 
to come okay so so far so good if I was
having<00:04:16.380> to<00:04:16.590> judge<00:04:17.040> between<00:04:17.400> these<00:04:17.940> I<00:04:18.180> would

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:18.450 
having to judge between these I would

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:20.420 
having to judge between these I would
say<00:04:19.049> that's<00:04:19.260> not<00:04:19.350> a<00:04:19.470> huge<00:04:19.859> amount<00:04:19.950> in<00:04:20.280> it

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430 
say that's not a huge amount in it

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:22.850 
say that's not a huge amount in it
actually<00:04:20.609> if<00:04:21.600> anything<00:04:21.780> the<00:04:22.140> Pelican<00:04:22.530> seems<00:04:22.740> a

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.860 
actually if anything the Pelican seems a

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:24.260 
actually if anything the Pelican seems a
bit<00:04:23.010> wetter<00:04:23.280> but<00:04:23.550> I<00:04:23.640> don't<00:04:23.850> think<00:04:23.970> there's<00:04:24.180> a

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:24.270 
bit wetter but I don't think there's a

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:27.320 
bit wetter but I don't think there's a
huge<00:04:24.480> amount<00:04:24.780> of<00:04:24.960> difference<00:04:25.490> in<00:04:26.490> the<00:04:26.880> volume

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:27.330 
huge amount of difference in the volume

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:29.180 
huge amount of difference in the volume
width<00:04:27.780> so<00:04:28.500> we're<00:04:28.620> just<00:04:28.740> going<00:04:28.860> to<00:04:28.890> have<00:04:29.010> a<00:04:29.070> go

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:29.190 
width so we're just going to have a go

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:31.520 
width so we're just going to have a go

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:35.520 
roll the noise a mouse in Lord which you

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:40.000 
roll the noise a mouse in Lord which you

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:03.050 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:06.469

well there we go so Paragon broad nib
Pelican<00:05:46.100> m-1000<00:05:47.100> I<00:05:47.600> would<00:05:48.600> say<00:05:48.750> much<00:05:49.200> the<00:05:49.440> same
