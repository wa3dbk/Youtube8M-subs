00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:25.079 
some numerical values here I know well I

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:26.360 
some numerical values here I know well I
don't<00:02:25.319> know<00:02:25.380> if<00:02:25.500> you<00:02:25.590> guys<00:02:25.709> like<00:02:25.769> numbers<00:02:26.250> but

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
don't know if you guys like numbers but

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.670 
don't know if you guys like numbers but
I<00:02:26.459> sure<00:02:26.670> as<00:02:26.700> hell<00:02:27.000> do<00:02:27.180> you<00:02:27.360> get<00:02:27.450> 350<00:02:28.140> points<00:02:28.380> for

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
I sure as hell do you get 350 points for

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.009 
I sure as hell do you get 350 points for
calling<00:02:28.950> in<00:02:29.040> the<00:02:29.129> recon<00:02:29.489> drone<00:02:29.849> and<00:02:30.540> for<00:02:30.780> every

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:31.019 
calling in the recon drone and for every

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:33.229 
calling in the recon drone and for every
guy<00:02:31.230> you<00:02:31.290> tagged<00:02:31.769> it's<00:02:32.129> 50<00:02:32.610> points<00:02:33.000> so<00:02:33.090> it's

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:33.239 
guy you tagged it's 50 points so it's

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:35.330 
guy you tagged it's 50 points so it's
pretty<00:02:33.390> much<00:02:33.510> like<00:02:33.660> getting<00:02:34.079> a<00:02:34.140> kill<00:02:34.410> more<00:02:35.220> or

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
pretty much like getting a kill more or

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:42.470 
pretty much like getting a kill more or
less<00:02:35.750> and<00:02:38.630> on<00:02:39.630> top<00:02:39.900> of<00:02:39.930> that<00:02:40.639> when<00:02:41.639> uh<00:02:41.670> when<00:02:42.239> a

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
less and on top of that when uh when a

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.360 
less and on top of that when uh when a
teammate<00:02:42.900> kills<00:02:43.290> someone<00:02:43.769> that<00:02:43.889> you<00:02:44.040> tagged

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
teammate kills someone that you tagged

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.050 
teammate kills someone that you tagged
it<00:02:45.299> gives<00:02:45.750> you<00:02:45.930> 20<00:02:46.290> more<00:02:46.410> points<00:02:46.829> so<00:02:47.060> that's

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
it gives you 20 more points so that's

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.360 
it gives you 20 more points so that's
pretty<00:02:48.329> much<00:02:48.450> a<00:02:48.630> guaranteed<00:02:49.170> 70<00:02:49.889> points<00:02:50.250> for

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
pretty much a guaranteed 70 points for

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.840 
pretty much a guaranteed 70 points for
every<00:02:50.579> every<00:02:51.470> every<00:02:52.470> person<00:02:53.130> that<00:02:53.370> you<00:02:53.549> tag

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
every every every person that you tag

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:58.099 
every every every person that you tag
which<00:02:55.489> nasty<00:02:56.489> and<00:02:56.970> a<00:02:57.150> good<00:02:57.329> recon<00:02:57.810> drone

00:02:58.099 --> 00:02:58.109 
which nasty and a good recon drone

00:02:58.109 --> 00:03:01.129 
which nasty and a good recon drone
you'll<00:02:58.319> probably<00:02:58.799> probably<00:02:59.250> tag<00:02:59.970> about<00:03:00.180> seven

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:01.139 
you'll probably probably tag about seven

00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:02.150 
you'll probably probably tag about seven
or<00:03:01.260> eight<00:03:01.380> people

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160

helicopter it flies around and it tags
people<00:03:16.829> and<00:03:16.980> what<00:03:17.160> it<00:03:17.280> what<00:03:17.790> I<00:03:17.819> mean<00:03:18.060> by<00:03:18.209> that

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:18.359 
people and what it what I mean by that

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:20.870 
people and what it what I mean by that
is<00:03:18.599> it<00:03:18.799> paints<00:03:19.799> them<00:03:19.919> on<00:03:20.010> the<00:03:20.130> radar<00:03:20.340> and<00:03:20.730> as

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
is it paints them on the radar and as

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:22.640 
is it paints them on the radar and as
far<00:03:21.090> as<00:03:21.239> I<00:03:21.329> can<00:03:21.389> tell<00:03:21.690> it's<00:03:21.900> permanent<00:03:22.500> until

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
far as I can tell it's permanent until

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:26.960 
far as I can tell it's permanent until
they<00:03:23.010> die<00:03:23.250> and<00:03:25.069> it<00:03:26.069> also<00:03:26.220> has<00:03:26.459> the<00:03:26.579> added<00:03:26.609> bonus

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
they die and it also has the added bonus

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.120 
they die and it also has the added bonus
of<00:03:27.269> giving<00:03:27.540> them<00:03:27.660> a<00:03:27.750> small<00:03:27.930> flashbang<00:03:28.709> effect

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130 
of giving them a small flashbang effect

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:31.339 
of giving them a small flashbang effect
so<00:03:29.489> if<00:03:30.299> you<00:03:30.450> manage<00:03:30.720> to<00:03:30.810> catch<00:03:31.019> them<00:03:31.260> when

00:03:31.339 --> 00:03:31.349 
so if you manage to catch them when

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:32.780 
so if you manage to catch them when
they're<00:03:31.500> like<00:03:31.650> fire<00:03:31.919> fighting<00:03:32.400> between<00:03:32.519> each

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
they're like fire fighting between each

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:35.210 
they're like fire fighting between each
other<00:03:33.000> team<00:03:33.299> versus<00:03:33.630> team<00:03:33.739> you<00:03:34.739> know<00:03:34.859> whatever

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
other team versus team you know whatever

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:36.979 
other team versus team you know whatever
you're<00:03:35.700> gonna<00:03:35.760> fuck<00:03:36.120> some<00:03:36.299> people<00:03:36.630> up<00:03:36.780> in

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:36.989 
you're gonna fuck some people up in

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:39.229 
you're gonna fuck some people up in
that's<00:03:37.620> just<00:03:37.769> the<00:03:37.980> bonus<00:03:38.220> the<00:03:38.519> real<00:03:38.669> bonus<00:03:39.090> is

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 
that's just the bonus the real bonus is

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:41.420 
that's just the bonus the real bonus is
tagging<00:03:39.780> them<00:03:39.900> on<00:03:39.989> the<00:03:40.109> radar<00:03:40.470> I<00:03:40.739> think<00:03:41.220> I<00:03:41.250> said

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
tagging them on the radar I think I said

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:43.200 
tagging them on the radar I think I said
as<00:03:41.579> far<00:03:41.759> as<00:03:41.790> I<00:03:41.970> can<00:03:42.030> tell

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:43.210 
as far as I can tell

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:47.610 
as far as I can tell
it<00:03:43.300> is<00:03:43.750> permanence<00:03:44.620> see<00:03:45.130> 20<00:03:45.490> points<00:03:46.440> so<00:03:47.440> many

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:47.620 
it is permanence see 20 points so many

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:50.550 
it is permanence see 20 points so many
points<00:03:48.010> but<00:03:48.610> ideally<00:03:49.510> what<00:03:49.750> you<00:03:49.930> want<00:03:50.170> to<00:03:50.380> have

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 
points but ideally what you want to have

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.060 
points but ideally what you want to have
happen<00:03:51.070> is<00:03:52.020> you<00:03:53.020> want<00:03:53.200> to<00:03:53.260> find<00:03:53.500> where<00:03:53.860> they're

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:54.070 
happen is you want to find where they're

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:57.660 
happen is you want to find where they're
spawning<00:03:54.460> and<00:03:55.000> I<00:03:55.870> I<00:03:56.380> shudder<00:03:57.100> to<00:03:57.160> think<00:03:57.280> this

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:57.670 
spawning and I I shudder to think this

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:00.360 
spawning and I I shudder to think this
like<00:03:57.880> if<00:03:58.000> I'm<00:03:58.150> playing<00:03:58.390> if<00:03:58.570> I<00:03:58.720> I<00:03:59.220> was<00:04:00.220> actually

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:00.370 
like if I'm playing if I I was actually

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:02.070 
like if I'm playing if I I was actually
playing<00:04:00.670> with<00:04:00.880> a<00:04:00.910> guy<00:04:01.420> who<00:04:01.480> was<00:04:01.750> using<00:04:01.930> the
