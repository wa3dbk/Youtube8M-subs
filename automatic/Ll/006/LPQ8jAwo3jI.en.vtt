Darian Grubb he said I've got a

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.730 
Darian Grubb he said I've got a
vibration<00:00:17.910> that<00:00:18.090> gauges<00:00:18.930> all<00:00:19.109> look<00:00:19.289> okay<00:00:19.710> but

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
vibration that gauges all look okay but

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.420 
vibration that gauges all look okay but
it<00:00:19.980> feels<00:00:20.160> like<00:00:20.279> a<00:00:20.430> harmonic<00:00:21.150> vibration<00:00:22.430> we

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
it feels like a harmonic vibration we

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.370 
it feels like a harmonic vibration we
just<00:00:23.640> heard<00:00:23.789> that<00:00:23.820> a<00:00:23.970> lot<00:00:24.090> down<00:00:24.660> here<00:00:24.689> the<00:00:25.080> last

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
just heard that a lot down here the last

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.050 
just heard that a lot down here the last
couple<00:00:25.710> of<00:00:25.740> days<00:00:25.890> the<00:00:26.189> cars<00:00:26.490> will<00:00:26.670> pick<00:00:26.820> up<00:00:26.939> a

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
couple of days the cars will pick up a

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.480 
couple of days the cars will pick up a
vibration<00:00:27.689> on<00:00:27.810> it<00:00:27.990> maybe<00:00:28.349> it's<00:00:28.560> a<00:00:28.650> what<00:00:29.400> do<00:00:29.460> you

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
vibration on it maybe it's a what do you

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.550 
vibration on it maybe it's a what do you
think<00:00:29.670> it<00:00:29.760> is<00:00:29.849> like<00:00:30.060> there<00:00:30.480> we've<00:00:31.080> heard<00:00:31.380> these

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
think it is like there we've heard these

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.260 
think it is like there we've heard these
guys<00:00:31.619> to<00:00:32.040> talk<00:00:32.219> about<00:00:32.369> how<00:00:32.640> they've<00:00:32.820> worked<00:00:33.030> so

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
guys to talk about how they've worked so

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.620 
guys to talk about how they've worked so
hard<00:00:33.770> to<00:00:34.770> get<00:00:34.950> everything<00:00:35.370> running<00:00:35.820> free<00:00:36.420> in

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
hard to get everything running free in

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.690 
hard to get everything running free in
the<00:00:37.079> drive<00:00:37.320> lining<00:00:37.860> you<00:00:37.980> just<00:00:38.129> wonder<00:00:38.579> if<00:00:38.670> that

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
the drive lining you just wonder if that

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.720 
the drive lining you just wonder if that
might<00:00:39.090> be<00:00:39.120> promoting<00:00:39.989> this<00:00:40.950> vibration

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
might be promoting this vibration

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.400 
might be promoting this vibration
through<00:00:41.910> the<00:00:41.969> drive<00:00:42.270> line<00:00:42.540> yeah<00:00:42.870> that<00:00:43.140> or

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
through the drive line yeah that or

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.110 
through the drive line yeah that or
sometimes<00:00:43.800> with<00:00:44.160> headers<00:00:44.460> you<00:00:44.850> know<00:00:44.969> the

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
sometimes with headers you know the

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.910 
sometimes with headers you know the
tailpipes<00:00:45.660> engine<00:00:46.500> will<00:00:46.590> go<00:00:46.680> through<00:00:46.890> a

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
tailpipes engine will go through a

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.590 
tailpipes engine will go through a
certain<00:00:47.280> range<00:00:47.489> and<00:00:47.850> sometime<00:00:48.239> it'll<00:00:48.450> make

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
certain range and sometime it'll make

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.090 
certain range and sometime it'll make
the<00:00:48.719> car<00:00:48.930> vibrate<00:00:49.410> a<00:00:49.440> little<00:00:49.710> bit<00:00:49.800> in<00:00:49.980> the

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
the car vibrate a little bit in the

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.279 
the car vibrate a little bit in the
driver's<00:00:50.489> seat<00:00:50.520> anyway<00:00:51.059> hey<00:00:51.840> well<00:00:52.020> we<00:00:52.140> got

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289

yeah<00:01:45.000> maybe<00:01:45.210> already<00:01:45.630> you<00:01:45.689> know<00:01:45.810> they<00:01:45.960> were

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
yeah maybe already you know they were

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.480 
yeah maybe already you know they were
working<00:01:46.140> on<00:01:46.560> the<00:01:46.649> front<00:01:46.860> of<00:01:46.920> that<00:01:47.040> car<00:01:47.250> trying

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
to get a little bit more downforce they

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.210 
to get a little bit more downforce they
could<00:01:49.110> have<00:01:49.200> taped<00:01:49.409> up<00:01:49.619> something<00:01:50.009> under

could have taped up something under

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.039 
could have taped up something under
there<00:01:50.430> or<00:01:50.670> maybe<00:01:51.210> added<00:01:51.630> a<00:01:51.689> little<00:01:51.869> bit<00:01:51.990> of

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
there or maybe added a little bit of

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:56.270 
there or maybe added a little bit of
tape<00:01:53.390> gang<00:01:54.390> up<00:01:54.689> on<00:01:54.869> Denny<00:01:55.170> Hamlin<00:01:55.619> in<00:01:55.740> this<00:01:55.890> 11

better<00:06:22.020> not<00:06:22.199> be<00:06:22.349> loose<00:06:22.560> in<00:06:22.830> when<00:06:23.009> you<00:06:23.099> get<00:06:23.190> one

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:23.310 
better not be loose in when you get one

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:24.830 
better not be loose in when you get one
of<00:06:23.370> those<00:06:23.430> big<00:06:23.639> pushes<00:06:23.940> from<00:06:24.270> behind<00:06:24.599> like

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:24.840 
of those big pushes from behind like

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:28.790 
of those big pushes from behind like
don't<00:06:25.320> he<00:06:25.380> just<00:06:25.590> got<00:06:25.800> you<00:06:27.380> what's<00:06:28.380> happened

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:28.800 
don't he just got you what's happened

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:31.040 
don't he just got you what's happened
with<00:06:28.889> the<00:06:29.039> outside<00:06:29.490> line<00:06:29.849> that's<00:06:30.360> not<00:06:30.539> working

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:31.050 
with the outside line that's not working

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:35.270 
with the outside line that's not working
as<00:06:31.500> well<00:06:31.889> as<00:06:32.610> we<00:06:32.880> thought<00:06:33.150> it<00:06:33.330> might<00:06:34.220> I<00:06:35.220> think

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:35.280 
as well as we thought it might I think

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:37.219 
as well as we thought it might I think
they're<00:06:35.849> able<00:06:36.120> to<00:06:36.270> keep<00:06:36.449> fresh<00:06:36.690> enough<00:06:36.930> tires

00:06:37.219 --> 00:06:37.229 
they're able to keep fresh enough tires

00:06:37.229 --> 00:06:38.600 
they're able to keep fresh enough tires
on<00:06:37.409> the<00:06:37.530> car<00:06:37.680> that<00:06:37.860> they<00:06:37.979> can<00:06:38.130> run<00:06:38.310> the<00:06:38.430> bottom

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:38.610 
on the car that they can run the bottom

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:41.120 
on the car that they can run the bottom
plus<00:06:39.330> the<00:06:39.570> temperature<00:06:40.110> being<00:06:40.409> as<00:06:40.620> cool<00:06:40.860> as<00:06:41.009> it

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:41.130 
plus the temperature being as cool as it

00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:43.040 
plus the temperature being as cool as it
is<00:06:41.159> I<00:06:41.550> think<00:06:42.030> there's<00:06:42.210> enough<00:06:42.539> grip<00:06:42.810> down

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:43.050 
is I think there's enough grip down

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:44.360 
is I think there's enough grip down
there<00:06:43.259> that<00:06:43.409> the<00:06:43.560> car<00:06:43.740> is<00:06:43.830> able<00:06:43.949> to<00:06:44.099> stick

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:44.370 
there that the car is able to stick

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:48.589 
there that the car is able to stick
pretty<00:06:44.550> well<00:06:46.610> only<00:06:47.610> that<00:06:47.789> high<00:06:47.970> groove<00:06:48.240> is<00:06:48.449> an

00:06:48.589 --> 00:06:48.599 
pretty well only that high groove is an

00:06:48.599 --> 00:06:50.689 
pretty well only that high groove is an
out-of-control<00:06:49.229> lose<00:06:49.710> can't<00:06:50.070> hang<00:06:50.250> on<00:06:50.400> to<00:06:50.430> it

00:06:50.689 --> 00:06:50.699 
out-of-control lose can't hang on to it

00:06:50.699 --> 00:06:52.939 
out-of-control lose can't hang on to it
groove<00:06:50.970> and<00:06:51.750> if<00:06:51.840> you<00:06:52.020> remember<00:06:52.409> right<00:06:52.440> with

00:06:52.939 --> 00:06:52.949 
groove and if you remember right with

00:06:52.949 --> 00:06:54.710 
groove and if you remember right with
Jimmie<00:06:53.250> Johnson<00:06:53.729> we<00:06:53.820> heard<00:06:54.000> him<00:06:54.330> and<00:06:54.509> Chad

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:54.720 
Jimmie Johnson we heard him and Chad

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:56.600 
Jimmie Johnson we heard him and Chad
