which<00:01:50.610> is<00:01:50.759> the<00:01:50.909> heart<00:01:51.119> cactus<00:01:51.630> I'm<00:01:51.960> going<00:01:52.259> to

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
which is the heart cactus I'm going to

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.499 
which is the heart cactus I'm going to
use<00:01:52.500> a<00:01:52.530> blue<00:01:52.890> color<00:01:53.189> for<00:01:53.549> the<00:01:53.610> base<00:01:53.820> I'm<00:01:54.240> going

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
use a blue color for the base I'm going

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.870 
use a blue color for the base I'm going
to<00:01:54.630> use<00:01:54.869> a<00:01:54.899> pretty<00:01:55.320> big<00:01:55.560> ball<00:01:55.799> of<00:01:56.070> green<00:01:56.460> clay

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
to use a pretty big ball of green clay

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.090 
to use a pretty big ball of green clay
now<00:01:57.360> this<00:01:57.630> one<00:01:57.840> is<00:01:57.869> tricky<00:01:58.439> because<00:01:58.469> you<00:01:58.920> have

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
now this one is tricky because you have

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.280 
now this one is tricky because you have
to<00:01:59.219> kind<00:01:59.369> of<00:01:59.490> sculpt<00:01:59.969> it<00:02:00.119> so<00:02:00.450> I'm<00:02:00.689> just<00:02:00.899> using<00:02:01.079> a

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
to kind of sculpt it so I'm just using a

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.050 
to kind of sculpt it so I'm just using a
toothpick<00:02:01.560> and<00:02:01.950> kind<00:02:02.250> of<00:02:02.310> running<00:02:02.670> it<00:02:02.759> along

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
toothpick and kind of running it along

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.959 
toothpick and kind of running it along
and<00:02:03.360> the<00:02:03.930> heart<00:02:04.200> is<00:02:04.380> a<00:02:04.409> little<00:02:04.829> lopsided<00:02:05.340> one

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
and the heart is a little lopsided one

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:07.880 
and the heart is a little lopsided one
side<00:02:06.180> is<00:02:06.299> higher<00:02:06.479> than<00:02:06.689> the<00:02:06.750> other<00:02:06.960> so<00:02:07.740> you're

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
side is higher than the other so you're

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.020 
side is higher than the other so you're
just<00:02:07.950> going<00:02:08.190> to<00:02:08.340> use<00:02:08.489> your<00:02:08.610> toothpick<00:02:09.000> and

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
just going to use your toothpick and

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.639 
just going to use your toothpick and
make<00:02:09.270> that<00:02:09.450> shape<00:02:09.690> and<00:02:09.929> right<00:02:10.200> now<00:02:10.349> kind<00:02:10.590> of

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
make that shape and right now kind of

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.369 
make that shape and right now kind of
like<00:02:10.830> a<00:02:10.860> butt<00:02:11.840> but<00:02:12.840> you're<00:02:13.080> just<00:02:13.200> going<00:02:13.319> to

00:02:13.369 --> 00:02:13.379 
like a butt but you're just going to

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:13.790 
like a butt but you're just going to
keep

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
keep

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.170 
keep
keeping<00:02:13.980> it<00:02:14.100> in<00:02:14.190> forming<00:02:14.550> it<00:02:14.670> to<00:02:14.790> make<00:02:14.910> it<00:02:14.940> look

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
keeping it in forming it to make it look

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:21.670 
keeping it in forming it to make it look
like<00:02:15.240> a<00:02:15.630> heart<00:02:15.690> and<00:02:16.350> not<00:02:16.740> a<00:02:16.950> giant<00:02:17.250> green<00:02:17.880> but

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.410 

for<00:02:22.680> the<00:02:22.770> record<00:02:22.920> I<00:02:23.310> am<00:02:23.340> really<00:02:23.850> really<00:02:23.970> bad<00:02:24.270> at

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
for the record I am really really bad at

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.960 
for the record I am really really bad at
making<00:02:24.570> faces<00:02:25.050> with<00:02:25.470> clay<00:02:25.770> I<00:02:26.040> much<00:02:26.370> prefer<00:02:26.760> to

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
making faces with clay I much prefer to

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:28.820 
making faces with clay I much prefer to
paint<00:02:27.180> them<00:02:27.390> but<00:02:27.600> I<00:02:27.630> tried<00:02:27.990> really<00:02:28.020> hard<00:02:28.290> so

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
paint them but I tried really hard so

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:30.500 
paint them but I tried really hard so
that's<00:02:29.550> why<00:02:29.700> the<00:02:29.790> face<00:02:29.940> looks<00:02:30.180> really<00:02:30.390> messy

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
that's why the face looks really messy

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.150 
that's why the face looks really messy
because<00:02:30.870> they<00:02:31.050> were<00:02:31.110> faced<00:02:31.470> off<00:02:31.680> like<00:02:31.890> 20

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
because they were faced off like 20

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.390 
because they were faced off like 20
times<00:02:32.340> but<00:02:33.330> this<00:02:33.690> is<00:02:33.840> what<00:02:34.020> it<00:02:34.110> will<00:02:34.170> look<00:02:34.230> like

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
times but this is what it will look like

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.140 
times but this is what it will look like
hopefully<00:02:35.400> yours<00:02:35.550> will<00:02:35.730> look<00:02:35.760> better<00:02:35.970> than

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
hopefully yours will look better than

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.350 
hopefully yours will look better than
mine<00:02:36.830> next<00:02:37.830> we're<00:02:37.920> going<00:02:38.070> to<00:02:38.190> make<00:02:38.460> and<00:02:38.910> I'm

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
mine next we're going to make and I'm

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.660 
mine next we're going to make and I'm
probably<00:02:39.510> gonna<00:02:39.690> say<00:02:39.810> this<00:02:39.960> wrong<00:02:40.170> Usagi<00:02:40.830> sabo

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
probably gonna say this wrong Usagi sabo

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.940 
probably gonna say this wrong Usagi sabo
which<00:02:42.060> is<00:02:42.270> a<00:02:42.420> bunny<00:02:42.690> cactus<00:02:43.290> so<00:02:43.680> I'm<00:02:43.800> just

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
which is a bunny cactus so I'm just

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.370 
which is a bunny cactus so I'm just
going<00:02:44.070> to<00:02:44.130> use<00:02:44.280> this<00:02:44.550> cream<00:02:45.240> colored<00:02:45.690> clay<00:02:46.050> I

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
going to use this cream colored clay I

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:47.990 
going to use this cream colored clay I
just<00:02:46.710> mix<00:02:46.920> a<00:02:47.010> little<00:02:47.160> bit<00:02:47.370> of<00:02:47.460> yellow<00:02:47.580> with

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
just mix a little bit of yellow with

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.240 
just mix a little bit of yellow with
some<00:02:48.240> white<00:02:48.480> and<00:02:48.840> then<00:02:49.350> form<00:02:49.680> again<00:02:49.950> another

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
some white and then form again another

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:53.270 
some white and then form again another
regular<00:02:51.000> cupcake<00:02:51.270> top<00:02:52.200> then<00:02:53.130> you're<00:02:53.250> just

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
regular cupcake top then you're just

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.040 
regular cupcake top then you're just
going<00:02:53.460> to<00:02:53.550> roll<00:02:53.700> out<00:02:53.910> two<00:02:54.210> logs<00:02:54.480> for<00:02:54.750> the<00:02:54.810> ears

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050 
going to roll out two logs for the ears

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:57.230 
going to roll out two logs for the ears
and<00:02:55.350> the<00:02:55.440> left<00:02:55.950> ear<00:02:56.130> is<00:02:56.400> a<00:02:56.430> little<00:02:56.700> taller<00:02:56.970> than

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:57.240 
and the left ear is a little taller than

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:58.490 
and the left ear is a little taller than
the<00:02:57.330> right<00:02:57.480> ear<00:02:57.780> so<00:02:58.080> we're<00:02:58.230> just<00:02:58.260> going<00:02:58.470> to

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
the right ear so we're just going to

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:59.930 
the right ear so we're just going to
take<00:02:58.620> that<00:02:58.800> into<00:02:59.040> consideration<00:02:59.100> when<00:02:59.730> we're

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
take that into consideration when we're

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:07.810 
take that into consideration when we're
putting<00:03:00.180> on<00:03:00.420> our<00:03:00.450> ears<00:03:00.780> and<00:03:01.070> blend<00:03:02.070> those<00:03:02.340> on

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:07.820 

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:11.240 

and<00:03:09.200> then<00:03:10.200> we're<00:03:10.350> going<00:03:10.440> to<00:03:10.500> texture<00:03:10.980> again

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
and then we're going to texture again

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:15.590 
and then we're going to texture again
with<00:03:11.400> a<00:03:11.610> brush<00:03:13.490> for<00:03:14.490> this<00:03:14.550> flower<00:03:14.940> I<00:03:15.330> didn't

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:15.600 
with a brush for this flower I didn't

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:16.880 
with a brush for this flower I didn't
want<00:03:15.720> to<00:03:15.810> make<00:03:15.900> a<00:03:15.960> whole<00:03:16.230> bunch<00:03:16.410> of<00:03:16.530> really

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
want to make a whole bunch of really

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:18.680 
want to make a whole bunch of really
really<00:03:17.250> tiny<00:03:17.430> balls<00:03:17.730> so<00:03:17.970> what<00:03:18.150> I<00:03:18.180> did<00:03:18.300> is<00:03:18.450> I

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
really tiny balls so what I did is I

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:20.870 
really tiny balls so what I did is I
just<00:03:18.870> made<00:03:19.080> a<00:03:19.290> flat<00:03:19.980> ball<00:03:20.190> and<00:03:20.430> then<00:03:20.520> used<00:03:20.730> a

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
just made a flat ball and then used a

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:22.940 
just made a flat ball and then used a
toothpick<00:03:21.300> to<00:03:21.690> push<00:03:21.989> in<00:03:22.200> the<00:03:22.230> sides<00:03:22.560> to<00:03:22.830> make

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
toothpick to push in the sides to make

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:25.340 
toothpick to push in the sides to make
the<00:03:23.130> petals<00:03:23.310> and<00:03:23.760> this<00:03:24.090> took<00:03:24.300> a<00:03:24.510> while<00:03:24.540> to<00:03:24.810> get

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:25.350 
the petals and this took a while to get

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:28.340 
the petals and this took a while to get
it<00:03:25.410> to<00:03:25.560> look<00:03:25.709> right<00:03:25.920> but<00:03:26.330> I<00:03:27.330> think<00:03:27.810> it<00:03:27.930> over<00:03:28.110> all

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350 
it to look right but I think it over all

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:30.800 
it to look right but I think it over all
came<00:03:28.530> out<00:03:28.560> pretty<00:03:28.800> good<00:03:29.100> and<00:03:29.370> then<00:03:29.720> there's<00:03:30.720> a

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
came out pretty good and then there's a

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:32.960 
came out pretty good and then there's a
star<00:03:31.260> shape<00:03:31.530> embedded<00:03:32.130> on<00:03:32.250> the<00:03:32.370> flower<00:03:32.580> so<00:03:32.940> I

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
star shape embedded on the flower so I
