not the end okay okay so we were first
shipment<00:02:05.740> fragment<00:02:06.740> from<00:02:07.069> the<00:02:07.280> ID<00:02:07.520> would<00:02:07.850> be

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.110 
shipment fragment from the ID would be

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:12.729 
shipment fragment from the ID would be
motive<00:02:09.319> is<00:02:10.100> our<00:02:10.280> audio<00:02:11.060> customer<00:02:11.739> so

00:02:12.729 --> 00:02:12.739 
motive is our audio customer so

00:02:29.259 --> 00:02:29.269 
yeah we just have this research for long

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:33.400 
yeah we just have this research for long
yeah<00:02:31.060> but<00:02:32.060> what<00:02:32.329> is<00:02:32.450> the<00:02:32.570> software<00:02:33.019> inside

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:33.410 
yeah but what is the software inside

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:36.759 
yeah but what is the software inside
here<00:02:33.769> is<00:02:34.010> it<00:02:34.190> Linux<00:02:34.519> yeah<00:02:35.299> Linux<00:02:36.019> know<00:02:36.290> what's

00:02:36.759 --> 00:02:36.769 
here is it Linux yeah Linux know what's

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:42.460 
here is it Linux yeah Linux know what's
CPU<00:02:39.130> which<00:02:40.130> one<00:02:40.310> secret<00:02:40.850> nah<00:02:41.420> rescale<00:02:42.170> maybe

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
CPU which one secret nah rescale maybe

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:45.610 
CPU which one secret nah rescale maybe
but<00:02:43.100> here<00:02:43.610> what<00:02:43.940> what's<00:02:44.239> CPU<00:02:44.959> use<00:02:45.170> here<00:02:45.440> is<00:02:45.590> a

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
but here what what's CPU use here is a

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:52.240 
but here what what's CPU use here is a
m3<00:02:48.940> 320<00:02:49.940> by<00:02:50.120> 240<00:02:50.620> pixel<00:02:51.620> yeah

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250 
m3 320 by 240 pixel yeah

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:55.229 
m3 320 by 240 pixel yeah
Bluetooth<00:02:52.700> Low<00:02:53.060> Energy<00:02:53.090> which<00:02:53.870> is<00:02:53.989> for<00:02:54.260> yeah
