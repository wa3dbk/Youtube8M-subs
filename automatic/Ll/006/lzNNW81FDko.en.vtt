00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:11.170 
clean touch common mistake number two is
that<00:02:09.709> the<00:02:09.860> young<00:02:10.129> player<00:02:10.399> is<00:02:10.580> a<00:02:10.700> heavy<00:02:10.970> touch

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
that the young player is a heavy touch

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.330 
that the young player is a heavy touch
on<00:02:11.390> the<00:02:11.480> ball<00:02:11.629> and<00:02:11.870> pushes<00:02:12.530> the<00:02:12.650> ball<00:02:12.799> too<00:02:13.010> far

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
ahead of them this gives the opportunity

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.080 
ahead of them this gives the opportunity
for<00:02:15.560> the<00:02:15.739> opponent<00:02:16.220> to<00:02:16.340> get<00:02:16.489> position<00:02:16.880> of<00:02:16.970> the

the player has lots of space in front of
them<00:02:31.840> the<00:02:32.840> third<00:02:33.019> common<00:02:33.379> mistake<00:02:33.680> that<00:02:33.860> young

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
them the third common mistake that young

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:35.229 
them the third common mistake that young
players<00:02:34.310> make<00:02:34.549> when<00:02:34.730> they're<00:02:34.849> dribbling<00:02:35.209> the

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:35.239 
players make when they're dribbling the

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:37.210 
players make when they're dribbling the
ball<00:02:35.450> is<00:02:36.049> that<00:02:36.230> they<00:02:36.349> push<00:02:36.560> the<00:02:36.739> ball<00:02:36.890> out<00:02:36.920> to

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
ball is that they push the ball out to

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:38.949 
ball is that they push the ball out to
the<00:02:37.340> side<00:02:37.640> instead<00:02:38.180> of<00:02:38.269> out<00:02:38.390> in<00:02:38.510> front<00:02:38.720> of<00:02:38.780> them

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:38.959 
the side instead of out in front of them

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:41.170 
the side instead of out in front of them
this<00:02:39.920> happens<00:02:40.250> because<00:02:40.400> the<00:02:40.610> young<00:02:40.910> player

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
this happens because the young player

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:42.819 
this happens because the young player
pushes<00:02:41.569> the<00:02:41.720> outside<00:02:42.230> of<00:02:42.349> the<00:02:42.410> foot<00:02:42.590> through

ball outwards it is important to remind

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:49.840

them making it easier for the next touch
the<00:02:57.620> fourth<00:02:57.889> common<00:02:58.280> mistake<00:02:58.579> that<00:02:58.609> young
