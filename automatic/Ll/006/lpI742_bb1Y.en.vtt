horses<00:01:39.070> are<00:01:39.369> symbolic<00:01:40.360> and<00:01:40.600> iconic<00:01:41.140> and

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
horses are symbolic and iconic and

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.870 
horses are symbolic and iconic and
especially<00:01:43.119> in<00:01:43.360> the<00:01:43.539> West<00:01:43.780> that<00:01:44.049> I<00:01:44.289> think<00:01:45.130> the

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:45.880 
especially in the West that I think the

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.260 
especially in the West that I think the
Mustang<00:01:46.680> symbolizes<00:01:47.680> freedom<00:01:48.009> and<00:01:48.520> in

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:49.270 
Mustang symbolizes freedom and in

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:52.200

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:52.210 
majesty in the American West and I think

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:54.719 
majesty in the American West and I think
students<00:01:52.840> are<00:01:52.990> drawn<00:01:53.289> to<00:01:53.770> the<00:01:53.950> West<00:01:54.189> because

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:54.729 
students are drawn to the West because

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:57.420 
students are drawn to the West because
it<00:01:54.969> symbolizes<00:01:55.270> freedom<00:01:56.020> the<00:01:56.799> open<00:01:57.159> spaces

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:57.430 
it symbolizes freedom the open spaces

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:00.959 
it symbolizes freedom the open spaces
the<00:01:57.670> mountains<00:01:58.450> the<00:01:58.780> clean<00:01:59.109> air<00:01:59.320> we<00:02:00.280> have<00:02:00.549> this

00:02:00.959 --> 00:02:00.969 
the mountains the clean air we have this

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:04.590 
the mountains the clean air we have this
I<00:02:01.210> think<00:02:01.329> unique<00:02:02.049> type<00:02:02.500> of<00:02:02.530> lifestyle<00:02:03.600> that's

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:04.600 
I think unique type of lifestyle that's

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.709 
I think unique type of lifestyle that's
relatively<00:02:05.530> conservative<00:02:06.399> not<00:02:07.000> complete<00:02:07.509> not

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
politically speaking but the lifestyle

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:13.340 
politically speaking but the lifestyle
of<00:02:11.070> conservation<00:02:12.070> we<00:02:12.310> can<00:02:12.490> serve<00:02:12.700> our

we use the lifestyle of horses in nature
and<00:02:18.860> farming<00:02:19.400> and<00:02:19.640> I<00:02:19.910> think<00:02:20.209> students<00:02:20.840> are

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:20.959 
and farming and I think students are
