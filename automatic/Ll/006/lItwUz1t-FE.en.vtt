00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 hello friends welcome to a new 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:06.270
 departure with our beloved chess what 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:09.389
 first I want to say in this video 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:11.490
 is that more never never won to Gary 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.769
 kasparov of the three items that are 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.859
 they know plays in the championship of 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:20.760
 fast king that there was in iceland in 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:23.670
 the year 2004 gary kasparov won 2 and he did 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.350
 some tables with more never arsÃ©ne vale 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.349
 how are we in the series of Gary 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.420
 kasparov, I wanted to bring you these three 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:33.239
 games, let's start with the first 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:36.530
 that won gary kasparov and that is a 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:39.510
 English opening a symmetrical variant 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:43.430
 where Gary Kasbarov wore the pieces 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:49.480
 white and the game started with c4 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:55.680
 jail on horse efe 6 caballo c 3 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:01:01.329
 c3 of the oku of baku and c5 of evil never 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:05.950
 bishop g2 knight c6 and we see that we have 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:14.600
 the aforementioned horse opening 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:19.430
 efe 3 and of 6 played bank of 40 x of 4 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:23.060
 cavallo for 4 and bishop for 7 we have 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:25.790
 a position totally matched by 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:28.610
 both opponents but let's see 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:31.670
 gary kasparov quickly as the 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:34.789
 ingenuity to make magnus carlsen 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:37.789
 two last pawns in the lady's wing 

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:41.299
 tell you also that at this moment more 

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:44.570
 he was never 13 years old and had an elo 

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:47.119
 2 thousand 484 points while Gary 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:51.140
 kasparov was already practically at 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:53.869
 end of his career and had 2 thousand 831 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:56.330
 points here and now 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:02:00.729
 Caritas to put their king under security 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:07.210
 short castling and carlsen makes bishop g7 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:07.210
 horse for c6 and bishop for c 6 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:15.230
 the 4th of gary kasparov magnum already in rock 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:22.490
 we also see both castling rely 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:26.480
 cheto bishop from 3 to 6 tower c 1 and horse 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:31.940
 7 of man never looking and points 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:36.920
 Strong as of 5 lady of 2 out of 4 out of 5 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:42.170
 forgiveness of 4 and horse on 5 manu 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:44.660
 mncars in segorbe 5 and 9 5 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:48.860
 here gary kasparov as the horse must 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:53.349
 5 bishop for b 5 also of more never be 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:53.349
 and lady at a time 5 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:59.120
 and here practically more is never committed 

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:01.070
 the first imprecision here 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:04.070
 probably the best move would have 

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:06.260
 been tower for seven getting 

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:10.460
 eliminate one of the two pawns that has 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:14.630
 on the queenside but Garry Kasparov 

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:17.630
 play lady see 8 trying to change the 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:22.370
 ladies and here already kasparov starts to have 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:26.240
 a small advantage with 4 lady for b 5 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:28.460
 of magnum and a by b 5 getting 

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:31.160
 checkpoints for these two passed pawns 

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:33.830
 but very strong in the lady's wing 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:36.980
 although they are bent here attacks him man 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:40.580
 a case with tower sees 8 attacks you 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:44.000
 pawns but of 6 already begins to be 

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:46.730
 defended by the bishop the pawn here already 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:51.680
 manu carsen commits the biggest mistake and 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:55.520
 play g4 horse attacking the bishop 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:58.370
 defender of the pawn to capture it but 

00:03:55.520 --> 00:04:00.650
 this is a big mistake here the best 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:04.910
 probably played was attacking the pawn 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:07.820
 weak the dv4 pawn with a tower to 4 but 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:10.700
 as I tell you more, you never play 

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:13.220
 g4 horse attacking that defender 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:15.220
 pawn but is practically no longer will 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:18.079
 It will allow time 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:21.859
 since gary kasparov incisively 

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:28.100
 plays his pawn ab7 which is good play 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:30.380
 but he also had the play 5 very good 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:32.810
 play releasing the action on the 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:36.080
 tower vale 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:38.570
 the action of the bishop of the end cheto the 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:41.120
 let's see now after seeing how 

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:43.700
 finished the game because it is a very good 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:46.790
 Garry Kasparov variant is 

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:50.210
 escaped so instead of playing the 5 he played 

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:52.520
 of 7 attacking also the tower and here 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:54.800
 and evil never realized that 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:57.560
 I was lost and abandoned because 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:05:01.050
 now they attack the tower to become 

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:04.199
 in lady and if tower by b 7 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:06.449
 now the 5 would also come practically 

00:05:04.199 --> 00:05:10.110
 the same play but with one with a 

00:05:06.449 --> 00:05:15.889
 less time let's say a time later and 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:18.540
 now yes tower sees 8 bishop by a 8 

00:05:15.889 --> 00:05:22.009
 tower by a 8 

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:24.889
 by 6 

00:05:22.009 --> 00:05:27.020
 and by 6 and then you must 5 

00:05:24.889 --> 00:05:29.839
 practically with more quality 

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:32.899
 gary Kasparov and this powerful worse 

00:05:29.839 --> 00:05:36.259
 almost unstoppable with the support of the two 

00:05:32.899 --> 00:05:38.180
 Towers in the game is more than won 

00:05:36.259 --> 00:05:41.180
 but let's go back to the other position 

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:43.479
 where Gary Kasbarov had a really good 

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:43.479
 move 

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:59.300
 we had that position and here we have 

00:05:55.669 --> 00:06:01.760
 seen how with b7 Gary Kasparov forced 

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:04.639
 man never to be leaving the game 

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:08.030
 but as I said, I also had the 

00:06:04.639 --> 00:06:10.580
 very nice play of 5 releasing the 

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:13.560
 action on the tower and if now horse 

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:17.669
 by three for 

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:21.030
 eliminate this pawn after then gary 

00:06:17.669 --> 00:06:23.500
 kasparov would have bishop for 8 horse 

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:27.400
 by f1 

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:30.060
 and here with you see 7 defending his bishop 

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:32.590
 and threatening towers entries 

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:35.140
 I would practically have to deliver here 

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:38.980
 the tower tower to see 7 since already 

00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:43.090
 threaten with tower entry to 8 ago 

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:46.180
 with full control of the position and how 

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:51.550
 I say yes tower to see 7 practically 

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:55.450
 c 8 equal tower forced checkmate bishop 

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:57.940
 8 and bishop for b 7 look at the position 

00:06:55.450 --> 00:06:59.950
 you can see how it would look like 

00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:01.870
 gary Kasparov had fully earned 

00:06:59.950 --> 00:07:04.660
 this position this chess game 

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:06.610
 who played with manu carsen in the next 

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:08.140
 videos we will see the next two 

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:11.020
 games that played 

00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:12.970
 these two talents world geniuses the 

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:14.740
 chess so with nothing else if you have 

00:07:12.970 --> 00:07:16.990
