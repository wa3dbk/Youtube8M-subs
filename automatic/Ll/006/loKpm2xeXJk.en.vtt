00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:03.740
 and 

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:10.800
 hello everyone and we keep spending up 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.960
 the coolest knife and you watch the sixth 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.570
 the knife part to the knife in this part will 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.330
 fewer exchanges than usual but plus 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.279
 would be nice so let's go for the most 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.900
 first exchange your bayonet m9 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.509
 surface hardened battle-hardened 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.910
 which was not blue at all I 

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:29.160
 decided to exchange it for a hunting knife night 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.439
 a little shabby she this care nothing 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.390
 it was not a very beautiful bow 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.489
 so I could be overpaid for it 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.710
 but regarding the price itself, I am not plus 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.990
 the exchange itself turned out to be equal 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.300
 in the second exchange I was offered to exchange 

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:45.030
 could see the knife the night of the folding knife 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.920
 killing right from the factory on this folding 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.960
 on the same murder of expensive drawings not 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.550
 it turned out but there were pictures for 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.710
 which could overpay 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.900
 but these people need to look for it 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.040
 it takes a lot of time now i 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:59.040
 I show you in 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:02.100
 This side of the play site and this backside 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:04.470
 Enough on the third exchange. 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.820
 I went into a plus of about 500 rubles and 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.299
 all due to the fact that I had a bunch 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:11.609
 the gear that you gave me either you or me 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.890
 knocked out when played and in general this whole 

00:01:11.609 --> 00:01:15.810
 the gear was about 200 rubles and 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.030
 we add the approximate price of the knife and 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:21.539
 approximate price of these items and we get 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:23.460
 the amount of 8,700 rubles and boldly change them to 

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:25.679
 a bloody spider's butterfly knife after 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.619
 The field tests on this butterfly were 

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:30.929
 whole three spider webs and she looked 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.759
 in the game itself is beautiful but the paint itself 

00:01:30.929 --> 00:01:34.950
 It turned out not so much as I wanted 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:37.289
 and the last exchange for today in which I 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.030
 Out by as much as 500 rubles in this plus 

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:40.340
 a blood knife for a paladin after 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.560
 field test 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.810
 with three web centers that are good 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.859
 I looked like I exchanged a knife for a bayonet 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.740
 blued steel 

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:50.329
 plus 12 keys, I can still 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.340
 advise when you will spend 

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:54.380
 about knives try to take 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:56.689
 exchange and in which you are offered a key and 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.700
 because in the future these keys are very 

00:01:56.689 --> 00:02:01.340
 easy to exchange if you don't believe me 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:03.590
 check yourself release turned out to be small 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.869
 But in general, I went to plus on 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:08.629
 one and a half thousand rubles for the whole 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:10.729
 week I awarded only 4 exchanges usually 

00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:12.860
 It happens that I blamed five for a week or 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:16.420
 six exchanges in general i will try 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:16.420
 good luck everyone all bye
