00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
then you just get some of this nashua

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.940 
then you just get some of this nashua
tape<00:02:41.300> it's<00:02:42.300> like<00:02:42.450> a<00:02:42.480> peel-off<00:02:42.870> aluminum<00:02:43.710> tape

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950

tape it's like a peel-off aluminum tape
and<00:02:44.390> you<00:02:45.390> cut<00:02:45.690> these<00:02:46.250> these<00:02:47.250> were<00:02:47.490> just<00:02:47.670> cut<00:02:48.000> to

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:49.100 
and you cut these these were just cut to

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:51.830 
and you cut these these were just cut to
size<00:02:50.100> of<00:02:50.340> the<00:02:50.400> window<00:02:50.790> just<00:02:51.090> basically<00:02:51.450> traced

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
size of the window just basically traced

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.150 
size of the window just basically traced
it<00:02:52.020> out<00:02:52.520> tape<00:02:53.520> them<00:02:53.730> together<00:02:53.910> and<00:02:55.010> you<00:02:56.010> could

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
it out tape them together and you could

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:57.710 
it out tape them together and you could
stick<00:02:56.400> them<00:02:56.520> up<00:02:56.670> and<00:02:56.910> pull<00:02:57.090> them<00:02:57.120> down<00:02:57.420> very

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
stick them up and pull them down very

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.860 
stick them up and pull them down very
easily<00:02:58.470> right<00:02:59.100> now<00:02:59.280> I<00:02:59.310> have<00:02:59.580> them<00:02:59.670> on<00:02:59.970> the

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
easily right now I have them on the

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.140 
easily right now I have them on the
window<00:03:01.170> so<00:03:01.230> you<00:03:01.410> guys<00:03:01.680> could<00:03:01.950> see<00:03:02.130> and<00:03:02.400> when

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
window so you guys could see and when

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.240 
window so you guys could see and when
you<00:03:03.240> go<00:03:03.360> to<00:03:03.420> sleep<00:03:03.600> back<00:03:04.320> here<00:03:04.650> at<00:03:04.740> night<00:03:04.950> and

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
you go to sleep back here at night and

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:08.210 
you go to sleep back here at night and
you<00:03:05.970> have<00:03:06.120> a<00:03:06.150> light<00:03:06.420> on<00:03:06.680> such<00:03:07.680> as<00:03:07.830> that<00:03:08.010> light

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
you have a light on such as that light

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.490 
you have a light on such as that light
there<00:03:08.810> nobody<00:03:09.810> could<00:03:09.990> see<00:03:10.170> through<00:03:10.380> the

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
there nobody could see through the

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.920 
there nobody could see through the
windows<00:03:10.830> and<00:03:11.100> so<00:03:11.310> I<00:03:11.550> ran<00:03:12.090> out<00:03:12.240> of<00:03:12.270> material<00:03:12.870> I

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
windows and so I ran out of material I

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:16.280 
windows and so I ran out of material I
just<00:03:12.959> have<00:03:13.170> this<00:03:13.290> little<00:03:13.560> bit<00:03:13.740> left<00:03:14.450> here<00:03:15.450> to

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
just have this little bit left here to

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:19.130 
just have this little bit left here to
do<00:03:16.470> the<00:03:16.680> those<00:03:17.340> one<00:03:17.850> two<00:03:18.180> windows<00:03:18.570> there<00:03:18.600> and

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140 
do the those one two windows there and

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:21.740 
do the those one two windows there and
the<00:03:19.350> the<00:03:20.340> other<00:03:20.489> window<00:03:20.910> right<00:03:21.180> there<00:03:21.570> and

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
the the other window right there and

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:23.960 
the the other window right there and
then<00:03:22.350> all<00:03:22.470> I<00:03:22.500> have<00:03:22.739> to<00:03:22.920> do<00:03:23.070> is<00:03:23.250> maybe<00:03:23.400> put<00:03:23.670> a<00:03:23.700> bar

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
then all I have to do is maybe put a bar

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.330 
then all I have to do is maybe put a bar
across<00:03:24.000> with<00:03:24.630> some<00:03:24.660> fabric<00:03:25.050> on<00:03:25.350> it<00:03:25.530> so<00:03:26.250> you

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
across with some fabric on it so you

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.900 
across with some fabric on it so you
can't<00:03:26.550> see<00:03:26.700> in<00:03:26.820> the<00:03:26.880> front<00:03:27.150> window<00:03:27.290> and<00:03:28.910> will

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
can't see in the front window and will

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:32.710 
can't see in the front window and will
be<00:03:30.060> nice<00:03:30.239> and<00:03:30.450> private<00:03:30.709> back<00:03:31.709> here<00:03:31.980> in<00:03:32.070> the<00:03:32.160> bed

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:32.720
