but yeah these stairs pretty much a
scoped<00:02:26.880> every<00:02:27.090> floor<00:02:27.300> every<00:02:27.360> flaw<00:02:27.720> is<00:02:27.780> pretty

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
scoped every floor every flaw is pretty

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:31.370 
scoped every floor every flaw is pretty
much<00:02:28.170> the<00:02:28.230> same<00:02:29.120> ok<00:02:30.120> so<00:02:30.510> all<00:02:30.810> the<00:02:30.930> way<00:02:31.020> up<00:02:31.200> and

that so up here it's nice and windy up
on<00:03:02.130> this<00:03:02.220> hill<00:03:02.490> it<00:03:03.300> would<00:03:03.570> be<00:03:03.840> making<00:03:04.410> lots<00:03:04.680> of

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:04.830 
on this hill it would be making lots of

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:06.110 
on this hill it would be making lots of
windy<00:03:05.040> noises<00:03:05.340> but<00:03:05.430> I've<00:03:05.550> got<00:03:05.640> to<00:03:05.670> say<00:03:05.850> on<00:03:05.910> turn

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
windy noises but I've got to say on turn

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.080 
windy noises but I've got to say on turn
off<00:03:06.330> so<00:03:06.950> it<00:03:07.950> doesn't<00:03:07.980> annoy<00:03:08.400> us<00:03:08.550> but<00:03:08.790> we<00:03:08.940> got

off so it doesn't annoy us but we got

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.210 
off so it doesn't annoy us but we got
some<00:03:09.240> windmills<00:03:09.540> windmills<00:03:10.440> wind<00:03:10.830> turbines

only a small part of our energy supply
over<00:03:18.189> here<00:03:18.519> though<00:03:20.040> this<00:03:21.040> is<00:03:21.400> our<00:03:21.999> main<00:03:22.269> energy

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540

we do get a decent supply of energy I

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:18.310 
we do get a decent supply of energy I
mean<00:04:14.959> power<00:04:15.170> to<00:04:15.620> the<00:04:16.269> factory<00:04:17.269> because<00:04:18.139> we

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:18.320 
mean power to the factory because we

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:19.870 
mean power to the factory because we
will<00:04:18.500> be<00:04:18.620> running<00:04:18.769> a<00:04:18.979> lot<00:04:19.130> of<00:04:19.250> machines<00:04:19.340> to

department which is what the wind
turbines<00:04:39.200> and<00:04:39.470> the<00:04:40.340> solar<00:04:41.330> panels<00:04:41.660> will<00:04:41.780> come

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:41.960 
turbines and the solar panels will come

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:44.290 
turbines and the solar panels will come
back<00:04:42.139> to<00:04:42.169> down<00:04:43.160> here<00:04:43.430> so<00:04:43.610> this<00:04:43.729> is<00:04:43.910> the<00:04:44.030> safety

oh<00:05:26.220> there<00:05:26.880> we<00:05:26.970> go<00:05:27.000> okay<00:05:27.750> so<00:05:28.200> these<00:05:29.630> should<00:05:30.630> be

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:30.690 
oh there we go okay so these should be

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:35.390 
oh there we go okay so these should be
almost<00:05:32.570> filled<00:05:33.570> yeah<00:05:34.200> we've<00:05:34.590> got<00:05:34.710> five<00:05:34.890> MFE

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:35.400 
almost filled yeah we've got five MFE

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:37.730 
almost filled yeah we've got five MFE
set<00:05:35.730> up<00:05:35.820> here<00:05:36.000> this<00:05:36.180> is<00:05:36.300> the<00:05:36.330> MFE<00:05:36.930> with<00:05:37.620> the

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:37.740 
set up here this is the MFE with the

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:39.470 
set up here this is the MFE with the
power<00:05:37.920> coming<00:05:38.190> from<00:05:38.280> now<00:05:38.580> wind<00:05:38.940> turbines<00:05:39.330> as

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:39.480 
power coming from now wind turbines as

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:41.120 
power coming from now wind turbines as
you<00:05:39.630> can<00:05:39.720> see<00:05:39.930> there's<00:05:40.530> not<00:05:40.680> a<00:05:40.710> lot<00:05:40.860> of<00:05:40.890> power

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:41.130 
you can see there's not a lot of power

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:43.550 
you can see there's not a lot of power
is<00:05:41.400> produced<00:05:41.880> by<00:05:42.120> them<00:05:42.420> because<00:05:42.720> as<00:05:42.960> we<00:05:43.410> don't

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:43.560 
is produced by them because as we don't

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:47.860 
is produced by them because as we don't
we<00:05:43.920> do<00:05:44.130> only<00:05:44.430> have<00:05:44.670> a<00:05:44.700> few<00:05:44.940> of<00:05:45.000> them<00:05:45.180> but<00:05:45.440> still

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:47.870 
we do only have a few of them but still

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:50.780 
we do only have a few of them but still
yeah<00:05:48.870> I'm<00:05:49.050> not<00:05:49.320> sure<00:05:49.650> there's<00:05:50.280> any<00:05:50.490> other<00:05:50.580> way

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:50.790 
yeah I'm not sure there's any other way

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:53.510 
yeah I'm not sure there's any other way
really<00:05:51.420> other<00:05:51.630> than<00:05:51.860> solar<00:05:52.860> panels<00:05:53.340> and<00:05:53.430> wind

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:53.520 
really other than solar panels and wind

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:56.930 
really other than solar panels and wind
turbines<00:05:54.090> to<00:05:54.950> how<00:05:55.950> are<00:05:56.160> the<00:05:56.250> factory<00:05:56.610> so<00:05:56.790> we're

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:56.940 
turbines to how are the factory so we're

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:58.040 
turbines to how are the factory so we're
going<00:05:57.060> to<00:05:57.150> definitely<00:05:57.300> have<00:05:57.600> a<00:05:57.630> lot<00:05:57.780> of<00:05:57.840> solar

00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:58.050 
going to definitely have a lot of solar

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:01.370 
going to definitely have a lot of solar
panels<00:05:59.510> so<00:06:00.510> yeah<00:06:00.660> that's<00:06:00.810> pretty<00:06:00.960> much<00:06:01.230> all

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:01.380 
panels so yeah that's pretty much all

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:03.560 
panels so yeah that's pretty much all
I've<00:06:01.530> done<00:06:01.680> of<00:06:01.860> the<00:06:02.040> jaffa<00:06:02.670> cake<00:06:02.940> factory<00:06:03.180> i'll
