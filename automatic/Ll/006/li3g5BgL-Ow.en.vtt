eating her but I thought when he bought
yellow<00:01:06.299> bitch<00:01:06.479> sha<00:01:06.600> na<00:01:06.780> ba<00:01:06.990> he's<00:01:07.140> coming<00:01:07.439> for

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
yellow bitch sha na ba he's coming for

yellow bitch sha na ba he's coming for
attack<00:01:07.799> of<00:01:07.920> him<00:01:08.010> then<00:01:08.130> he<00:01:08.220> bought<00:01:08.400> and<00:01:08.640> each<00:01:09.060> be

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
attack of him then he bought and each be

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.300 
attack of him then he bought and each be
off<00:01:09.450> so<00:01:09.810> it<00:01:10.380> was<00:01:10.500> a<00:01:10.560> bit<00:01:10.740> it<00:01:10.920> was<00:01:11.040> a<00:01:11.070> bit<00:01:11.189> weird

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
off so it was a bit it was a bit weird

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.219 
off so it was a bit it was a bit weird
but<00:01:11.520> I<00:01:11.610> think<00:01:11.820> and<00:01:12.270> I<00:01:12.360> think<00:01:12.390> Moyes's<00:01:12.930> all<00:01:13.080> that

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
but I think and I think Moyes's all that

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.740 
but I think and I think Moyes's all that
one<00:01:13.770> of<00:01:13.890> them<00:01:14.010> games<00:01:14.250> r<00:01:14.400> is<00:01:14.490> really<00:01:15.000> odd<00:01:15.180> really

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
one of them games r is really odd really

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:16.999 
one of them games r is really odd really
are<00:01:15.869> because<00:01:16.140> really<00:01:16.380> ought<00:01:16.500> to<00:01:16.530> break<00:01:16.799> him

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
are because really ought to break him

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.649 
are because really ought to break him
down<00:01:17.040> they've<00:01:17.729> got<00:01:17.759> everybody<00:01:18.240> behind<00:01:18.509> the

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
down they've got everybody behind the

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.050 
down they've got everybody behind the
board<00:01:18.840> I<00:01:18.960> got<00:01:19.110> a<00:01:19.140> lump<00:01:19.470> Fellaini<00:01:20.220> in<00:01:20.640> a

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
board I got a lump Fellaini in a

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.980 
board I got a lump Fellaini in a
midfield<00:01:21.750> it<00:01:22.259> was<00:01:22.439> really<00:01:22.740> odd

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:23.990 
midfield it was really odd

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:26.530 
midfield it was really odd
yeah<00:01:24.650> but<00:01:24.829> I<00:01:24.860> think<00:01:25.159> Fellaini<00:01:25.490> was<00:01:25.820> kicking

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:26.540 
yeah but I think Fellaini was kicking

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:29.469 
yeah but I think Fellaini was kicking
everyone<00:01:26.960> he<00:01:27.259> seemed<00:01:27.530> to<00:01:27.590> be<00:01:27.909> the<00:01:28.909> start<00:01:29.180> will

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:29.479 
everyone he seemed to be the start will

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:31.510 
everyone he seemed to be the start will
she<00:01:29.689> kicking<00:01:30.229> him<00:01:30.350> throwing<00:01:31.130> him<00:01:31.340> on<00:01:31.430> the

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:31.520 
she kicking him throwing him on the

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.969 
she kicking him throwing him on the
floor<00:01:31.759> I<00:01:32.149> thought<00:01:32.840> Fellaini<00:01:33.259> gotta<00:01:33.530> wave<00:01:33.680> so

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:33.979 
floor I thought Fellaini gotta wave so

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:36.280 
floor I thought Fellaini gotta wave so
much<00:01:34.189> to<00:01:34.369> my<00:01:34.490> shoulder<00:01:35.210> barging<00:01:35.659> okay<00:01:36.049> show<00:01:36.259> me
