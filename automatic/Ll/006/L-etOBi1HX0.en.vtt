00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
it after I killed all of them and i'm

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.250 
it after I killed all of them and i'm
here<00:00:24.990> now<00:00:25.519> let's<00:00:26.519> take<00:00:26.730> it<00:00:26.849> off<00:00:26.970> look<00:00:27.570> it<00:00:27.720> over

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
here now let's take it off look it over

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.659 
here now let's take it off look it over
here<00:00:28.680> this<00:00:29.039> is<00:00:29.369> where<00:00:29.519> the<00:00:29.730> armor<00:00:30.269> is<00:00:30.300> it<00:00:30.480> and

00:00:31.659 --> 00:00:31.669 
here this is where the armor is it and

here this is where the armor is it and
it's<00:00:32.669> pretty<00:00:32.850> obvious<00:00:33.300> because<00:00:33.480> last<00:00:33.899> time<00:00:34.050> I

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
it's pretty obvious because last time I

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.160 
it's pretty obvious because last time I
was<00:00:35.100> over<00:00:35.250> here<00:00:35.399> and<00:00:35.820> I<00:00:36.329> told<00:00:36.570> you<00:00:36.719> guys<00:00:36.870> and

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.749 

geez<00:01:07.320> there<00:01:08.320> you<00:01:08.380> go<00:01:08.500> that's<00:01:08.829> the<00:01:08.979> rub<00:01:09.520> net

00:01:09.749 --> 00:01:09.759 
geez there you go that's the rub net

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:13.139 
geez there you go that's the rub net
power<00:01:09.939> armor<00:01:11.159> it's<00:01:12.159> not<00:01:12.280> very<00:01:12.430> repaired<00:01:12.939> right

00:01:13.139 --> 00:01:13.149 
power armor it's not very repaired right

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:18.660 
power armor it's not very repaired right
now<00:01:13.329> and<00:01:13.630> it<00:01:13.960> has<00:01:14.970> let's<00:01:15.970> see<00:01:17.070> that's<00:01:18.070> 18

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:18.670 
now and it has let's see that's 18

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:21.090 
now and it has let's see that's 18
defense<00:01:19.240> and<00:01:19.600> it's<00:01:19.899> not<00:01:20.080> even<00:01:20.110> upgraded<00:01:20.799> well

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:21.100 
defense and it's not even upgraded well

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.370 
defense and it's not even upgraded well
so<00:01:21.789> if<00:01:21.909> you<00:01:22.030> get<00:01:22.149> that<00:01:22.299> upgraded<00:01:22.840> you<00:01:23.229> can<00:01:23.320> go

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:23.380 
so if you get that upgraded you can go

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:24.960 
so if you get that upgraded you can go
to<00:01:23.439> Lady<00:01:23.679> Gibson<00:01:24.070> and<00:01:24.189> get<00:01:24.280> it<00:01:24.369> upgraded<00:01:24.729> from

to Lady Gibson and get it upgraded from
I<00:01:25.330> mean<00:01:25.570> repairs<00:01:26.020> for<00:01:26.200> free<00:01:26.439> or<00:01:26.950> from<00:01:27.490> some

I mean repairs for free or from some
money<00:01:27.880> and<00:01:28.149> it'll<00:01:29.049> probably<00:01:29.289> have<00:01:29.530> like<00:01:29.710> like

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:30.670 
money and it'll probably have like like

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:35.160 
money and it'll probably have like like
30<00:01:30.970> defense<00:01:31.710> so<00:01:32.970> anyway<00:01:33.970> that's<00:01:34.179> um<00:01:34.479> where<00:01:34.960> the
