dusty dusty motors shroud for my
Stampede<00:00:46.860> 4x4<00:00:47.489> now<00:00:48.329> I<00:00:48.570> ended<00:00:48.809> up<00:00:48.840> going<00:00:49.020> with

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
Stampede 4x4 now I ended up going with

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.319 
Stampede 4x4 now I ended up going with
black<00:00:49.680> because<00:00:50.520> the<00:00:50.550> colors<00:00:51.180> that<00:00:51.270> are

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
black because the colors that are

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.110 
black because the colors that are
available<00:00:51.420> are<00:00:52.050> red<00:00:52.469> blue<00:00:52.890> and<00:00:52.920> black<00:00:53.309> and<00:00:53.610> I

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
available are red blue and black and I

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.119 
available are red blue and black and I
kind<00:00:54.360> of<00:00:54.420> thought<00:00:54.570> it'd<00:00:54.719> be<00:00:54.750> pretty<00:00:55.350> cool<00:00:55.949> just

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
kind of thought it'd be pretty cool just

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:57.439 
kind of thought it'd be pretty cool just
to<00:00:56.250> give<00:00:56.489> it<00:00:56.520> a<00:00:56.670> little<00:00:56.760> bit<00:00:56.969> more<00:00:57.120> of<00:00:57.180> a<00:00:57.239> black

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
to give it a little bit more of a black

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.029 
to give it a little bit more of a black
thing<00:00:57.690> they<00:00:57.870> do<00:00:57.930> not<00:00:58.199> have<00:00:58.379> pink<00:00:58.710> which<00:00:58.890> would

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
thing they do not have pink which would

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.580 
thing they do not have pink which would
have<00:00:59.160> been<00:00:59.250> awesome<00:00:59.460> but<00:01:00.329> you<00:01:00.449> know<00:01:00.539> what<00:01:00.690> this

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
have been awesome but you know what this

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.799 
have been awesome but you know what this
should<00:01:01.800> be<00:01:01.890> good<00:01:02.010> to<00:01:02.129> go<00:01:02.160> so<00:01:02.629> primarily<00:01:03.629> what<00:01:03.780> I

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
should be good to go so primarily what I

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.149 
should be good to go so primarily what I
have<00:01:03.899> to<00:01:03.960> do<00:01:04.080> is<00:01:04.199> take<00:01:04.379> off<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:04.619> decals<00:01:05.010> which

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
have to do is take off the decals which

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:06.440 
have to do is take off the decals which
is<00:01:05.280> kind<00:01:05.460> of<00:01:05.489> sad<00:01:05.790> I've<00:01:06.000> to<00:01:06.119> take<00:01:06.210> off<00:01:06.330> these

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
is kind of sad I've to take off these

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.240 
is kind of sad I've to take off these
decals<00:01:06.869> but<00:01:07.020> I<00:01:07.320> want<00:01:07.680> to<00:01:07.770> protect<00:01:08.100> the

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
decals but I want to protect the

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.990 
decals but I want to protect the
internal<00:01:08.820> parts<00:01:09.439> of<00:01:10.439> the<00:01:10.799> chassis<00:01:11.220> because<00:01:11.700> it

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
internal parts of the chassis because it

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.090 
internal parts of the chassis because it
doesn't<00:01:12.270> get<00:01:12.330> dirty<00:01:12.479> after<00:01:12.900> a<00:01:12.930> while<00:01:13.080> so<00:01:13.439> let

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
doesn't get dirty after a while so let

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.320 
doesn't get dirty after a while so let

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
me take off the body and start

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.789 
me take off the body and start
everything<00:01:15.689> going<00:01:17.720> all<00:01:18.720> righty<00:01:18.900> so<00:01:19.200> I<00:01:19.229> removed

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
everything going all righty so I removed

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.390 
everything going all righty so I removed
the<00:01:19.890> decal<00:01:20.280> in<00:01:20.430> the<00:01:20.549> and<00:01:20.850> the<00:01:21.180> body<00:01:21.720> off<00:01:22.020> there

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:22.400 
the decal in the and the body off there

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.530 
the decal in the and the body off there
this<00:01:23.400> part<00:01:23.670> of<00:01:23.909> this<00:01:23.970> should<00:01:24.119> be<00:01:24.210> a<00:01:24.240> real

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
this part of this should be a real

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.740 
this part of this should be a real
simple<00:01:25.080> really<00:01:26.009> really<00:01:26.280> simple<00:01:26.640> upgrade<00:01:27.390> on

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
simple really really simple upgrade on

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.039 
simple really really simple upgrade on
this<00:01:27.869> because<00:01:28.590> there's<00:01:28.799> not<00:01:29.509> side<00:01:30.509> bumpers<00:01:30.900> or

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
this because there's not side bumpers or

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.960 
this because there's not side bumpers or
anything<00:01:31.200> like<00:01:31.409> that<00:01:31.470> or<00:01:32.040> doors<00:01:32.610> that

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
anything like that or doors that

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.420 
anything like that or doors that
infringe<00:01:33.900> on<00:01:34.049> me<00:01:34.229> putting<00:01:34.530> this<00:01:34.619> on<00:01:34.829> so

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
infringe on me putting this on so

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:36.890 
infringe on me putting this on so
basically<00:01:35.549> the<00:01:35.939> measurements<00:01:36.420> would<00:01:36.479> be<00:01:36.659> from

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
basically the measurements would be from

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.550 
basically the measurements would be from
here<00:01:37.320> to<00:01:37.430> the<00:01:38.430> end<00:01:38.610> part<00:01:38.939> over<00:01:39.150> here<00:01:39.479> and<00:01:39.750> it's

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
here to the end part over here and it's

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.469 
here to the end part over here and it's
primarily<00:01:40.950> all<00:01:41.490> I<00:01:41.549> have<00:01:41.700> to<00:01:41.820> do<00:01:41.939> is<00:01:42.090> wrap<00:01:42.450> the

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
primarily all I have to do is wrap the

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.450 
primarily all I have to do is wrap the
shroud<00:01:42.840> around<00:01:42.869> and<00:01:43.470> it<00:01:43.920> should<00:01:44.100> be<00:01:44.220> pretty

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
shroud around and it should be pretty

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.240 
shroud around and it should be pretty
simple<00:01:44.909> so<00:01:45.470> like<00:01:46.470> I'll<00:01:46.590> always<00:01:46.680> say<00:01:46.950> again

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
simple so like I'll always say again

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.160 
simple so like I'll always say again
when<00:01:47.670> you're<00:01:47.820> cutting<00:01:48.210> these<00:01:48.360> velcro<00:01:48.689> pieces

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
when you're cutting these velcro pieces

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.469 
when you're cutting these velcro pieces
just<00:01:50.100> make<00:01:50.310> sure<00:01:50.549> that<00:01:50.759> whatever<00:01:51.060> side<00:01:51.360> you're

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
just make sure that whatever side you're

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.270 
just make sure that whatever side you're
doing<00:01:51.720> on<00:01:51.840> one<00:01:52.020> do<00:01:52.409> it<00:01:52.530> to<00:01:52.619> the<00:01:52.710> other<00:01:52.920> they're

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
doing on one do it to the other they're

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.940 
doing on one do it to the other they're
both<00:01:53.549> the<00:01:53.790> same<00:01:53.820> exact<00:01:54.329> side<00:01:54.570> so<00:01:55.350> let<00:01:55.740> me<00:01:55.829> get

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
both the same exact side so let me get

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.319 
both the same exact side so let me get
the<00:01:56.040> velcro<00:01:56.219> on<00:01:56.369> and<00:01:56.759> get<00:01:56.909> everything<00:01:57.119> up<00:01:57.299> and

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
the velcro on and get everything up and

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:00.280 
the velcro on and get everything up and
running
