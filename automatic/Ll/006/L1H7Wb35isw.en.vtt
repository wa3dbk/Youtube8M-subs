this is the simplest and cleverest
little<00:00:12.630> toilet<00:00:12.809> system<00:00:13.290> I'd<00:00:13.440> ever<00:00:13.710> seen

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
little toilet system I'd ever seen

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.599 
little toilet system I'd ever seen
because<00:00:14.790> I<00:00:15.120> could<00:00:15.870> do<00:00:15.990> this<00:00:16.170> and<00:00:16.500> I'm<00:00:17.279> quite

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
because I could do this and I'm quite

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:18.710 
because I could do this and I'm quite
impressed<00:00:17.760> the<00:00:18.119> fact<00:00:18.300> that<00:00:18.420> there<00:00:18.600> is

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
impressed the fact that there is

is<00:00:21.029> a<00:00:21.060> very<00:00:21.390> very<00:00:21.810> simple<00:00:22.140> system

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
is a very very simple system

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.910 
is a very very simple system
well<00:00:23.550> basically<00:00:24.119> and<00:00:24.810> it's<00:00:25.230> a<00:00:25.380> 20<00:00:25.710> liter

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
well basically and it's a 20 liter

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.359 
well basically and it's a 20 liter
bucket<00:00:26.310> with<00:00:26.760> a<00:00:27.230> toilet<00:00:28.230> seat<00:00:28.529> and<00:00:28.710> lid<00:00:29.039> on<00:00:29.220> it

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
bucket with a toilet seat and lid on it

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.889 
bucket with a toilet seat and lid on it
and<00:00:30.859> this<00:00:31.859> is<00:00:32.040> a<00:00:32.239> bottle<00:00:33.239> of<00:00:33.329> effective

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
and this is a bottle of effective

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.880 
and this is a bottle of effective
microorganisms<00:00:34.190> which<00:00:35.840> the<00:00:36.840> Japanese<00:00:37.350> idea

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
microorganisms which the Japanese idea

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.790 
microorganisms which the Japanese idea
they<00:00:38.219> cultured<00:00:39.120> all<00:00:39.480> the<00:00:39.660> microorganisms<00:00:40.530> for

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
they cultured all the microorganisms for

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.610 
they cultured all the microorganisms for
food<00:00:41.010> preparation<00:00:41.870> so<00:00:42.870> you<00:00:42.930> know<00:00:43.079> for<00:00:43.290> making

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
food preparation so you know for making

whatever Akashi
that's<00:00:51.360> another<00:00:51.949> passion<00:00:52.949> that's<00:00:53.219> the<00:00:53.430> same

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
that's another passion that's the same

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.360 
that's another passion that's the same
product<00:00:54.149> and<00:00:54.780> that's<00:00:55.230> why<00:00:55.530> it<00:00:55.590> doesn't<00:00:55.949> smell

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
product and that's why it doesn't smell

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.119 
product and that's why it doesn't smell
because<00:00:56.910> it<00:00:57.059> actually<00:00:57.420> breaks<00:00:57.629> it<00:00:58.440> removes

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
because it actually breaks it removes

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.790 
because it actually breaks it removes
smell<00:00:59.550> almost<00:00:59.899> instantly<00:01:00.899> and<00:01:01.289> it<00:01:01.500> breaks

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
smell almost instantly and it breaks

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.170 
smell almost instantly and it breaks
down<00:01:02.989> stuff<00:01:03.989> very<00:01:04.470> quickly<00:01:04.580> so<00:01:05.580> this<00:01:05.820> is<00:01:05.970> just

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
down stuff very quickly so this is just

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.140 
down stuff very quickly so this is just
wood<00:01:06.990> shavings<00:01:07.470> just<00:01:08.070> put<00:01:08.280> a<00:01:08.310> small<00:01:08.700> handful

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
wood shavings just put a small handful

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:14.060 
wood shavings just put a small handful
down<00:01:09.360> each<00:01:09.570> time<00:01:09.600> you<00:01:10.020> use<00:01:10.170> it<00:01:10.460> and<00:01:12.380> then<00:01:13.380> when

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
down each time you use it and then when

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.999 
down each time you use it and then when
it's<00:01:14.280> half<00:01:14.549> full<00:01:15.290> and<00:01:16.290> you<00:01:16.470> can<00:01:16.619> urinate

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
it's half full and you can urinate

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.830 
it's half full and you can urinate
another<00:01:17.490> that's<00:01:17.670> absolutely<00:01:18.180> fine<00:01:18.450> when<00:01:18.689> it's

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
another that's absolutely fine when it's

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:24.190 
another that's absolutely fine when it's
half<00:01:19.020> full<00:01:19.049> it's<00:01:19.920> easy<00:01:20.220> to<00:01:20.939> carry<00:01:21.240> over<00:01:21.630> here

actually that's been in use for about

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.080 
actually that's been in use for about
eight<00:02:09.270> months

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.090 
eight months

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:13.470 
eight months
eight<00:02:10.330> mum<00:02:10.660> and<00:02:11.590> so<00:02:12.160> quite<00:02:12.670> a<00:02:12.700> long<00:02:12.849> time<00:02:13.150> and

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
eight mum and so quite a long time and

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.589 
eight mum and so quite a long time and
it<00:02:14.019> just<00:02:14.290> keeps<00:02:14.530> on<00:02:14.739> going<00:02:15.040> down<00:02:15.489> as<00:02:16.269> it<00:02:16.450> keeps

00:02:16.589 --> 00:02:16.599 
it just keeps on going down as it keeps

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:18.869 
it just keeps on going down as it keeps
getting<00:02:16.840> filled<00:02:17.290> because<00:02:17.500> of<00:02:17.890> the<00:02:18.069> action<00:02:18.790> of

00:02:18.869 --> 00:02:18.879 
getting filled because of the action of

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:21.809 
getting filled because of the action of
the<00:02:19.030> composting<00:02:19.660> so<00:02:20.080> the<00:02:20.680> compost<00:02:21.519> from<00:02:21.790> a

00:02:21.809 --> 00:02:21.819 
the composting so the compost from a

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:23.490 
the composting so the compost from a
compost<00:02:22.300> toilet<00:02:22.480> is<00:02:22.780> very<00:02:23.019> useful<00:02:23.470> for

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
compost toilet is very useful for

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.839 
compost toilet is very useful for
fertilizing<00:02:24.160> trees<00:02:24.670> and<00:02:25.000> as<00:02:25.989> a<00:02:26.019> by-product

00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:26.849 
fertilizing trees and as a by-product

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:29.250 
fertilizing trees and as a by-product
any<00:02:27.849> seeds<00:02:28.209> that<00:02:28.390> pass<00:02:28.690> through<00:02:28.930> a<00:02:29.019> human
