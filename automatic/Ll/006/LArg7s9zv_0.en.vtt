00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:31.019
 good to remember you had this new adventure 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:33.000
 force stayed on his side only for 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:37.440
 Because I saw that I was not going to win. 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:40.020
 Everything was wonderful and I did not stop 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.690
 telemarketing I know what it's like to be a 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.129
 boring attendant as I created a boring all round

 world says he is an answering 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.739
 telemarketing is annoying 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.600
 this time I will give examples of how the 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.039
 Clients can close the 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.520
 although we leave 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:56.090
 Now tell that powell made others in 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.090
 green 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:10.470
 it's very annoying capital but how do you do 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.720
 five types of customers I came to 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.580
 tendency is not to work is no longer the 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.220
 First, I did not like you. 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.960
 type of customer deaf service 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.780
 Good morning customer service 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:25.619

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.590

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:39.930
 This is it, can not you hear me there at the top with 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:43.340
 your shirt 10 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:53.340
 I did not understand for lack of communication 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:58.229
 The call will be closed now I've seen 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:02:01.079
 vai se fuder The second reason is what 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:03.000

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:04.439
 customer service by 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.920
 day I can give 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.920
 ae 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:13.490
 you can but you do not 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:17.000
 It's gotta scream, it's not good. 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:21.220
 Please, excuse me, I'm sorry, I'm not going. 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.220
 more scream but you're listening to me 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:27.170
 he fell 

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:29.510
 Hello Hello 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:31.310
 The third one for me is one of the worst is the 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:33.080
 What do you think is funny? 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.720

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:44.080
 Phew you have the name of the fighting guy. 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:46.340
 You have the name of the guy who carries Sam 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:49.100
 but then the time starts that 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:49.760
 a bad joke because I thought it was not 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:51.350
 cool 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.120

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:55.100
 My job is the customer service. 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:57.140
