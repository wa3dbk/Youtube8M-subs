all<00:00:03.360> right<00:00:03.480> well<00:00:03.629> I<00:00:03.659> work<00:00:03.840> on<00:00:03.990> the<00:00:04.080> three

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:04.290 
all right well I work on the three

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:11.200 
all right well I work on the three
horsepower<00:00:04.589> novo<00:00:05.190> for<00:00:05.460> a<00:00:05.520> while<00:00:05.670> endured<00:00:05.940> a

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:11.210 

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:15.890 

create<00:00:12.210> a<00:00:12.269> few<00:00:12.480> things<00:00:12.780> up<00:00:13.969> adjusted<00:00:14.969> or<00:00:15.719> the

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
create a few things up adjusted or the

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:22.099 
create a few things up adjusted or the
latch<00:00:16.080> out<00:00:16.289> mechanism<00:00:16.890> I<00:00:20.630> don't<00:00:21.630> believe<00:00:21.869> this

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
latch out mechanism I don't believe this

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.340 
latch out mechanism I don't believe this
engine<00:00:22.529> ran<00:00:23.240> the<00:00:24.240> last<00:00:24.390> time<00:00:24.689> was<00:00:24.900> worked<00:00:25.140> on

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
engine ran the last time was worked on

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.290 
engine ran the last time was worked on
which<00:00:25.650> I<00:00:25.800> guess<00:00:25.980> they<00:00:26.310> would<00:00:26.369> that<00:00:26.609> was<00:00:26.789> it<00:00:27.029> was

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
which I guess they would that was it was

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.640 
which I guess they would that was it was
painted<00:00:27.800> because<00:00:28.820> the<00:00:29.960> the<00:00:30.960> latch<00:00:31.140> finger

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
painted because the the latch finger

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:37.490 
painted because the the latch finger
right<00:00:31.859> here<00:00:32.930> was<00:00:33.930> actually<00:00:34.440> I<00:00:35.840> think<00:00:36.840> it's<00:00:37.200> I

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
right here was actually I think it's I

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:38.840 
right here was actually I think it's I
don't<00:00:37.530> think<00:00:37.739> it's<00:00:37.950> original<00:00:38.160> I<00:00:38.460> think<00:00:38.700> it's

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
don't think it's original I think it's

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.280 
don't think it's original I think it's
been<00:00:39.120> you<00:00:39.510> know<00:00:39.540> homemade<00:00:40.460> but<00:00:42.020> it<00:00:43.020> wouldn't

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
been you know homemade but it wouldn't

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.190 
been you know homemade but it wouldn't
allow<00:00:43.440> the<00:00:43.969> exhaust<00:00:44.969> valve<00:00:45.239> to<00:00:45.390> come<00:00:45.960> back

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
allow the exhaust valve to come back

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:53.229 
allow the exhaust valve to come back
closed<00:00:46.620> who's<00:00:47.550> stuck<00:00:47.820> latch<00:00:48.059> down<00:00:49.940> so<00:00:50.940> I

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:53.239 
closed who's stuck latch down so I

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:56.060 
closed who's stuck latch down so I
ground<00:00:54.239> that<00:00:54.420> down<00:00:54.719> adjusted<00:00:55.199> that<00:00:55.379> just<00:00:55.920> the

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
ground that down adjusted that just the

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.459 
ground that down adjusted that just the
spring<00:00:56.370> tension<00:00:56.610> on<00:00:56.940> it<00:00:57.090> and<00:00:57.780> just<00:00:57.989> spring

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
spring tension on it and just spring

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.729 
spring tension on it and just spring
tension<00:00:58.920> on<00:00:59.070> the<00:00:59.899> lever<00:01:00.899> that<00:01:01.079> contacts<00:01:01.680> the

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
tension on the lever that contacts the

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.640 
tension on the lever that contacts the
governor<00:01:02.100> weights<00:01:03.170> look<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:04.350> governor

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
governor weights look the governor

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:10.039 
governor weights look the governor
weight<00:01:04.830> is<00:01:04.949> only<00:01:05.070> one<00:01:05.309> in<00:01:05.460> this<00:01:05.580> engine<00:01:08.990> so<00:01:09.990> she

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
weight is only one in this engine so she

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.289 
weight is only one in this engine so she
runs<00:01:10.350> it<00:01:10.860> was<00:01:11.010> good<00:01:11.250> for<00:01:11.549> you<00:01:11.760> know<00:01:11.850> the<00:01:12.090> first

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
runs it was good for you know the first

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.929 
runs it was good for you know the first
day<00:01:12.510> and<00:01:12.630> everything<00:01:13.049> I<00:01:13.340> haven't<00:01:14.340> gone

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
day and everything I haven't gone

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.820 
day and everything I haven't gone
through<00:01:15.000> the<00:01:15.180> fuel<00:01:15.450> pump<00:01:15.720> yet<00:01:15.960> so<00:01:16.560> if<00:01:16.710> she's

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
through the fuel pump yet so if she's

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.789 
through the fuel pump yet so if she's
just<00:01:17.009> running<00:01:17.130> on<00:01:17.869> what<00:01:18.869> I<00:01:18.900> primed<00:01:19.380> it<00:01:19.560> with<00:01:19.680> in

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
just running on what I primed it with in

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.800 
just running on what I primed it with in
the<00:01:19.890> chamber<00:01:20.280> here<00:01:20.549> so<00:01:21.090> over<00:01:21.299> on<00:01:21.420> for<00:01:21.630> very

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
the chamber here so over on for very

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.450 
the chamber here so over on for very
long<00:01:22.729> it's<00:01:23.729> probably<00:01:24.409> only<00:01:25.409> about<00:01:25.530> two-thirds

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
long it's probably only about two-thirds

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.960 
long it's probably only about two-thirds
the<00:01:26.580> way<00:01:26.640> full<00:01:27.799> but<00:01:28.799> that<00:01:29.460> wasn't<00:01:29.790> too<00:01:29.850> much

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
the way full but that wasn't too much

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:30.679 
the way full but that wasn't too much
wrong<00:01:30.180> with<00:01:30.360> it

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
wrong with it

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.830 
wrong with it
I<00:01:30.720> had<00:01:31.710> to<00:01:31.829> drain<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:32.159> oil<00:01:32.189> from<00:01:32.430> the<00:01:32.750> from<00:01:33.750> the

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
I had to drain the oil from the from the

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.530 
I had to drain the oil from the from the
crankcase<00:01:34.549> it's<00:01:35.549> really<00:01:35.759> kind<00:01:35.970> of<00:01:36.000> a<00:01:36.090> bugger

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
crankcase it's really kind of a bugger

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.780 
crankcase it's really kind of a bugger
to<00:01:36.750> drain<00:01:37.020> cuz<00:01:37.290> there's<00:01:37.470> a<00:01:37.530> drain<00:01:37.829> plug<00:01:38.460> right

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
to drain cuz there's a drain plug right

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.910 
to drain cuz there's a drain plug right
there<00:01:38.850> and<00:01:39.240> there's<00:01:40.200> real<00:01:40.350> no<00:01:40.470> easy<00:01:40.680> way<00:01:40.860> to

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
there and there's real no easy way to

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.050 
there and there's real no easy way to
get<00:01:41.130> a<00:01:41.189> funnel<00:01:41.460> under<00:01:41.729> there

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
get a funnel under there

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.880 
get a funnel under there
so<00:01:42.180> I<00:01:42.210> just<00:01:42.420> stuck<00:01:42.630> a<00:01:42.689> piece<00:01:42.930> of<00:01:43.079> gas<00:01:43.350> hose<00:01:43.619> in

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
so I just stuck a piece of gas hose in

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.700 
so I just stuck a piece of gas hose in
there<00:01:44.070> and<00:01:44.189> turn<00:01:44.909> it<00:01:44.939> into<00:01:45.119> a<00:01:45.180> bottle<00:01:45.710> that's

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
there and turn it into a bottle that's

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.530 
there and turn it into a bottle that's
all<00:01:46.920> that<00:01:47.070> came<00:01:47.220> out<00:01:47.399> of<00:01:47.549> it

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
all that came out of it

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.790 
all that came out of it
quite<00:01:49.530> full<00:01:50.630> and<00:01:51.630> it's<00:01:51.810> oil<00:01:52.080> -<00:01:52.230> it's<00:01:52.410> not<00:01:52.590> like

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:52.800 
quite full and it's oil - it's not like

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:54.950 
quite full and it's oil - it's not like
it's<00:01:52.950> water<00:01:53.190> or<00:01:53.400> anything<00:01:53.580> it's<00:01:54.570> dirty<00:01:54.780> we

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
it's water or anything it's dirty we

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.310 
it's water or anything it's dirty we
open<00:01:55.230> its<00:01:55.350> oil<00:01:56.450> so<00:01:57.450> I<00:01:57.480> just<00:01:57.630> have<00:01:57.810> buzz<00:01:57.990> coil

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
open its oil so I just have buzz coil

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.960 
open its oil so I just have buzz coil
hook<00:01:58.680> up<00:01:58.860> to<00:01:59.010> it<00:01:59.100> now<00:01:59.130> you<00:01:59.490> know<00:01:59.700> just

00:01:59.960 --> 00:01:59.970 
hook up to it now you know just

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:02.270 
hook up to it now you know just
jerry-rigged<00:02:00.480> on<00:02:00.630> there<00:02:01.130> even<00:02:02.130> though<00:02:02.190> this

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
jerry-rigged on there even though this

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.860 
jerry-rigged on there even though this
engine<00:02:02.670> did<00:02:02.850> originally<00:02:03.240> have<00:02:03.360> a<00:02:03.390> buzz<00:02:03.570> coil

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:03.870 
engine did originally have a buzz coil

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:06.190 
engine did originally have a buzz coil
so<00:02:04.140> it's<00:02:04.290> not<00:02:04.380> like<00:02:04.590> it's<00:02:04.770> missing<00:02:05.100> anything

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
so it's not like it's missing anything

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.969 
so it's not like it's missing anything
but<00:02:07.200> uh<00:02:08.570> it's<00:02:09.570> it's<00:02:10.020> borrowing<00:02:10.470> the<00:02:10.590> oil<00:02:10.770> for

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
but uh it's it's borrowing the oil for

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:14.150 
but uh it's it's borrowing the oil for
my<00:02:11.100> three<00:02:11.310> horsepower<00:02:11.550> Achilles<00:02:12.270> since<00:02:13.160> this

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
my three horsepower Achilles since this

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.230 
my three horsepower Achilles since this
oil<00:02:14.400> are<00:02:14.670> here<00:02:16.100> so<00:02:17.100> missing<00:02:17.490> some<00:02:17.640> things<00:02:17.670> and

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
oil are here so missing some things and

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:26.650 
oil are here so missing some things and
say<00:02:19.790> saucy<00:02:20.790> throw<00:02:21.720> it<00:02:21.840> over<00:02:22.080> and<00:02:22.670> start<00:02:23.670> it<00:02:23.820> up

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:28.730
