00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:20.450
 you know this character to taste is coll 

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:22.819
 this has to pass the 10 wave of 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:23.899
 survival so that I greet the 

00:01:22.819 --> 00:01:24.979
 I passed because I wanted to play 

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:28.579
 survival but really this 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:31.939
 character is like that is colossal x 

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:34.219
 It is not the same gallon for duch 

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:35.780

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:38.569
 of difference to the other paddock more 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:40.159

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:43.099
 a blowjob that this character exists 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:45.530
 but hey this is unlocked unlock this 

00:01:43.099 --> 00:01:48.500

 existing but you can find it in 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:39.600
 There is a market selling everything 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:42.000

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:45.420
 buyer and in this case I got it 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.700

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:24.420
 I managed to bring in gamers, it's already 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:25.680
 a little common this character I have seen 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:28.890
 that many suddenly have this 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:30.840
 Character is more common than anya and good 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:33.720
 I have a skin Samil me the truth 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:35.069
 I really like to use this character and how 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:37.709
 I got good and so I put a 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:39.150
 friend in my shirt so they see 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:40.560
 to you because suddenly they ask me there 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:42.359
 which observation his character is not 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:44.010
 I can pass them because I do not have 

00:03:42.359 --> 00:03:46.799
 they passed the licenses but they are not in 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:48.659
 my account ok and anyway no 

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:50.220
 I used to spend my account ok so 

00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:51.870
 sometimes I'm explaining how it 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:53.280
 they get and how they got it and for 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:54.629
 that we go see the following 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.170
 character 

00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:58.360
 two 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:00.910
 george version less young than 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:03.280
 got in game plans the truth is not 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:06.130
 pretty hard to get to my 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:08.080
 judgment but well there are many suddenly 

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:10.780
 they do not know how he got or not what 

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:12.910
 they have or they want it the truth is not 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:14.830
 so that you say wow is the 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:17.260
 character of the year is pretty good at 

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:20.290
 character and I liked it a lot as it looks 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:22.270
 with his black armor and something that 

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:23.620
 liked this character when I liked it 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:25.630
 I noticed is that if you 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:26.770
 read the description of the character says 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:28.900
 during yachting events 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:32.050
 Dominique Santiago was censored in 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:32.800
 censored censored and censored before 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:34.780
 censored 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:38.169
 finally it dares not understood nothing 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:40.090
 truth of the dominique santiago this in 

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:41.680
 everything is censored I do not know if they go to 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:43.600
 do something in the future in a universe 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:44.830
 in an 11 with some ministor already of 

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:46.270
 dominique santiago but good 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:48.130
 apparently the description everything is 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:50.110
 censored ok 

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:53.290
 let's go to finish frames and well this one 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:55.570
 I got in game brush this I got it 

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:58.460
 by my presale 

00:04:55.570 --> 00:05:00.500
 we already know them all and 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:01.850
 green damon repercussions as 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:03.620
 announced this character according to 

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:05.150
 description of the character is finished 

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:06.860
 unlocking any achievement but you see 

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:09.380
 that the epic were removed from the sleeve 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:11.990
 another promotion and it was given by a 

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:14.000
 gray code that is I think I buy a 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:16.130
 soda or something like a mantle bowl I do not 

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.470
 agreement where equal for the usa and 

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:19.880
 so this character was achieved 

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:23.210
 but hey, it's really much better 

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:25.880
 this verg will agree with me that 

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:27.229
 is what minion kim characters feel 

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:30.229
 the truth I do not remember how it 

00:05:27.229 --> 00:05:32.510
 unlock this character but it comes 

00:05:30.229 --> 00:05:35.590
 for all and finally the characters 

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:37.900
 onix guard both female and male 

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:39.979
 okay 

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:41.810
 how do you get it is I think the 

00:05:39.979 --> 00:05:44.150
 question that many have asked and 

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:46.190
 yes even though you already have time is the 

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:47.750
 game they keep asking him how he 

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:50.090
 get our very strong is very easy 

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:53.340
 they have to go to the interface and if not 

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:55.889
 they have the season pass huelva and pipes 

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:57.750
 If they are baby or as they know they have 

00:05:55.889 --> 00:05:59.850
 to buy it and if they want these 

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:01.380
 characters that have if they are peace good 

00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:03.479
 apart you have other things for these 

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:06.870
 people who bring skin armor 

00:06:03.479 --> 00:06:09.570
 arms right to both of the stress that 

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:11.340
 etcetera etcetera etcetera and so on 

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:13.320
 well obviously all these characters 

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:15.570
 are the ones that have come out so far 

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:17.160
 the legal ones now yes that those 

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:18.570
 can get at this time to 

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:20.040
 be able to play multicolored and obviously the 

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:23.010
 epic hyper but good that I do not tell 

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:25.290
 because one I do not have and two obviously 

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:28.770
 this is a special character no no 

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:31.200
 you always have and obviously we already saw 

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:32.520
 characters like those of weston and clayton 

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:34.410
 carmine but good these characters 

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:36.430
 they have not left when they leave then 

00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:38.320
 I will have this 

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:40.810
 that I can not imagine it going 

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:42.730
 to be for all download them and so on 

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:43.960
 I hope you liked all the 

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:47.200
 characters of gears of war already done in 

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:50.710
 this moment they are a total of 1 2 3 4 5 6 

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:52.990
 7 14 17 characters the truth is 

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:55.410
 quite few in my opinion about everything 

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:57.460
 because we no longer have low cost then 

00:06:55.410 --> 00:06:59.980
 I did not like it suddenly more 

00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:05.380
 variety I calculate that there will be 

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:07.500
 a lot of 411 more characters like to 

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:10.990
 that give four exact rows at the most 

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:12.100
 this but good obviously is a 

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:13.810
 foolishness because I say it he can 

00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:14.830
 down then I do not expect you to like this 

00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:16.270
 video I do not know well to leave its like 

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:17.950
 subscribe to the channel if they are not 

00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:19.870
 subscribed someone vote it down here 

00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:21.520
 and share the video with your friends 

00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:23.890
 leave a comment on which character 

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:25.360
 the one that they like more than characters the 

00:07:23.890 --> 00:07:28.300
 that they think is the most difficult of 

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:30.880
 get to do a poll do not over 

00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:32.440
 about the characters I for my course the 

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:35.650
 character that made it harder for me 

00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:36.490
 to get was added and when you say 

00:07:35.650 --> 00:07:38.020
 yours 

00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:40.350
 efe in the grau ser and see you until the 

00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:40.350
 next
