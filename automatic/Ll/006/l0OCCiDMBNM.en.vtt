00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
that around as much as possible and then

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:30.300 
that around as much as possible and then
because<00:02:29.050> the<00:02:29.140> bristles<00:02:29.350> are<00:02:29.590> so<00:02:29.770> long<00:02:30.010> on<00:02:30.160> this

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
because the bristles are so long on this

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.640 
because the bristles are so long on this
brush<00:02:30.580> you<00:02:30.790> can<00:02:31.030> keep<00:02:31.330> it<00:02:31.480> in<00:02:31.630> so<00:02:32.260> basically

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
brush you can keep it in so basically

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:34.380 
brush you can keep it in so basically
you<00:02:32.830> just<00:02:32.890> want<00:02:33.220> to<00:02:33.250> let<00:02:33.400> that<00:02:33.520> cool<00:02:33.790> down<00:02:33.850> and

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
you just want to let that cool down and

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:36.990 
you just want to let that cool down and
this<00:02:35.260> brush<00:02:35.620> actually<00:02:35.890> retains<00:02:36.490> the<00:02:36.790> heat

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
this brush actually retains the heat

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.690 
this brush actually retains the heat
it's<00:02:37.240> really<00:02:37.750> great<00:02:38.020> for<00:02:38.320> that<00:02:38.350> so<00:02:39.340> what<00:02:39.580> that

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
it's really great for that so what that

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.970 
it's really great for that so what that
means<00:02:39.940> is<00:02:40.120> it<00:02:40.240> sort<00:02:40.420> of<00:02:40.480> is<00:02:40.660> working<00:02:41.410> as<00:02:41.620> like<00:02:41.950> a

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
means is it sort of is working as like a

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:44.160 
means is it sort of is working as like a
bit<00:02:42.250> of<00:02:42.340> a<00:02:42.430> massive<00:02:43.030> heat<00:02:43.180> around<00:02:43.510> the<00:02:43.720> eyes<00:02:43.900> so

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
bit of a massive heat around the eyes so

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:45.780 
bit of a massive heat around the eyes so
