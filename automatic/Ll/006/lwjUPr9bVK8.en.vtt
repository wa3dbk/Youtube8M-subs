to<00:00:15.580> Bonneville<00:00:16.029> and<00:00:16.200> we<00:00:17.200> have<00:00:17.349> made<00:00:17.800> major

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:18.220 
to Bonneville and we have made major

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:20.609 
to Bonneville and we have made major
modifications<00:00:19.210> with<00:00:19.720> the<00:00:19.869> engine<00:00:20.200> starting

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:20.619 
modifications with the engine starting

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:23.670 
modifications with the engine starting
with<00:00:20.740> the<00:00:20.860> camshafts<00:00:21.430> the<00:00:22.300> cylinder<00:00:22.720> head<00:00:22.960> the

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:31.720 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.229 

we<00:00:32.590> also<00:00:32.739> increase<00:00:33.370> the<00:00:33.550> compression<00:00:33.880> ratio

00:00:34.229 --> 00:00:34.239 
we also increase the compression ratio

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:36.330 
we also increase the compression ratio
from<00:00:34.720> eight<00:00:34.960> to<00:00:35.140> one<00:00:35.290> to<00:00:35.530> twelve<00:00:35.800> to<00:00:35.980> one<00:00:36.010> and

from eight to one to twelve to one and

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:39.150 
from eight to one to twelve to one and
then<00:00:37.180> address<00:00:37.810> that<00:00:38.080> with<00:00:38.350> the<00:00:38.590> proper

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:39.160 
then address that with the proper

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:42.030 
then address that with the proper
exhaust<00:00:39.700> system<00:00:40.120> and<00:00:40.330> also<00:00:40.590> larger<00:00:41.590> throttle

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:42.040 
exhaust system and also larger throttle

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:44.549 
exhaust system and also larger throttle
bodies<00:00:42.309> that<00:00:42.580> we<00:00:42.700> custom-built<00:00:43.390> and<00:00:43.530> also<00:00:44.530> a

00:00:44.549 --> 00:00:44.559 
bodies that we custom-built and also a

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:47.670 
bodies that we custom-built and also a
very<00:00:44.980> sophisticated<00:00:45.430> EFI<00:00:46.390> system<00:00:46.680> we

very sophisticated EFI system we

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:49.979 
very sophisticated EFI system we
completely<00:00:48.190> modified<00:00:48.430> the<00:00:49.239> cylinder<00:00:49.750> head

00:00:49.979 --> 00:00:49.989 
completely modified the cylinder head

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:52.080 
completely modified the cylinder head
increase<00:00:50.739> the<00:00:50.890> area<00:00:51.250> of<00:00:51.370> the<00:00:51.489> intake<00:00:51.820> valve

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:52.090 
increase the area of the intake valve

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:55.770 
increase the area of the intake valve
over<00:00:52.390> 40%<00:00:52.750> and<00:00:53.410> with<00:00:53.980> titanium<00:00:54.430> retainers<00:00:54.780> you

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:55.780 
over 40% and with titanium retainers you

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:58.890 
over 40% and with titanium retainers you

maximum flow the cylinder head is there

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:08.130 
maximum flow the cylinder head is there
is<00:01:06.460> no<00:01:06.729> more<00:01:06.970> to<00:01:07.090> do<00:01:07.240> on<00:01:07.270> it<00:01:07.570> it<00:01:07.660> is<00:01:07.690> totally

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:08.140 
is no more to do on it it is totally

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:13.760 
is no more to do on it it is totally
maxed<00:01:08.380> out

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.950 

we<00:01:14.770> spent<00:01:15.070> a<00:01:15.159> lot<00:01:15.189> of<00:01:15.369> time<00:01:15.670> choosing<00:01:16.270> a<00:01:16.540> proper

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:16.960 
we spent a lot of time choosing a proper

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.050 
we spent a lot of time choosing a proper
design<00:01:17.200> of<00:01:17.590> the<00:01:17.680> fairing<00:01:18.070> to<00:01:18.250> allow<00:01:18.549> the<00:01:18.610> rider

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:19.060 
design of the fairing to allow the rider

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:21.870 
design of the fairing to allow the rider
to<00:01:19.210> be<00:01:19.509> completely<00:01:20.140> in<00:01:20.460> enveloped<00:01:21.460> within<00:01:21.729> the

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:21.880 
to be completely in enveloped within the

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:23.820 
to be completely in enveloped within the
fairing<00:01:22.270> in<00:01:22.840> order<00:01:23.080> to<00:01:23.170> do<00:01:23.320> that<00:01:23.500> we<00:01:23.619> had<00:01:23.799> to

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:23.830 
fairing in order to do that we had to

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:25.260 
fairing in order to do that we had to
shorten<00:01:24.399> the<00:01:24.640> clip-ons

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:25.270 
shorten the clip-ons

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:28.410 
shorten the clip-ons
shorten<00:01:25.960> delivers<00:01:26.460> cut<00:01:27.460> the<00:01:27.610> levers<00:01:27.939> whatever

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:28.420 
shorten delivers cut the levers whatever

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:30.810 
shorten delivers cut the levers whatever
it<00:01:28.539> took<00:01:28.720> to<00:01:28.780> get<00:01:29.079> this<00:01:29.259> to<00:01:29.500> work<00:01:29.530> and<00:01:29.979> with<00:01:30.700> all

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:30.820 
it took to get this to work and with all

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:32.340 
it took to get this to work and with all
these<00:01:30.970> modifications<00:01:31.420> we're<00:01:32.140> actually

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:32.350 
these modifications we're actually

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:43.490 
these modifications we're actually
hoping<00:01:32.679> to<00:01:32.890> double<00:01:33.100> the<00:01:33.340> horsepower

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.050 

it's<00:01:44.500> been<00:01:44.680> a<00:01:44.710> great<00:01:44.980> build<00:01:45.310> a<00:01:45.520> great<00:01:45.820> team

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:46.060 
it's been a great build a great team

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:47.970 
it's been a great build a great team
effort<00:01:46.450> here<00:01:46.480> at<00:01:46.750> South<00:01:46.990> Bay<00:01:47.260> and<00:01:47.500> we<00:01:47.710> can't

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:47.980 
effort here at South Bay and we can't

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:50.940 
effort here at South Bay and we can't
wait<00:01:48.160> to<00:01:48.190> go<00:01:48.430> to<00:01:48.490> Bonneville
