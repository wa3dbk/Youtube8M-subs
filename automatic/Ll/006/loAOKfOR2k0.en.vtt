00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:26.250 
on Snapple peach iced tea it opened up
in<00:00:23.110> my<00:00:23.199> bag<00:00:23.610> so<00:00:24.610> surprisingly<00:00:25.570> i'm<00:00:25.810> able<00:00:25.990> to<00:00:26.109> do

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:26.260 
in my bag so surprisingly i'm able to do

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.429 
in my bag so surprisingly i'm able to do
a<00:00:26.289> video<00:00:26.560> but<00:00:27.160> i<00:00:27.430> can't<00:00:27.789> scroll<00:00:28.119> through<00:00:28.510> the

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:31.729 
a video but i can't scroll through the
photos<00:00:29.470> so<00:00:30.189> i<00:00:30.430> think<00:00:30.550> it<00:00:30.880> has<00:00:31.029> to<00:00:31.060> dry<00:00:31.330> out

00:00:31.729 --> 00:00:31.739 
photos so i think it has to dry out

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:34.259 
photos so i think it has to dry out
obviously<00:00:32.739> if<00:00:32.890> i'm<00:00:33.010> able<00:00:33.219> to<00:00:33.370> do<00:00:33.609> a<00:00:33.640> video<00:00:33.850> and

00:00:34.259 --> 00:00:34.269 
obviously if i'm able to do a video and

00:00:34.269 --> 00:00:35.940 
obviously if i'm able to do a video and
record<00:00:34.359> this<00:00:34.750> and<00:00:35.020> if<00:00:35.380> you're<00:00:35.500> getting<00:00:35.800> it

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:35.950 
record this and if you're getting it

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:38.760 
record this and if you're getting it
then<00:00:36.130> that<00:00:36.250> means<00:00:36.430> that<00:00:36.780> my<00:00:37.780> camera<00:00:38.200> is<00:00:38.350> ok<00:00:38.710> but
