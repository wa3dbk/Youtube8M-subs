dead<00:00:12.389> center<00:00:12.840> and<00:00:14.389> then<00:00:15.389> I<00:00:15.780> went<00:00:16.440> and<00:00:17.039> this<00:00:17.220> is

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
dead center and then I went and this is

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:19.099 
dead center and then I went and this is
a<00:00:17.400> distributor<00:00:17.940> by<00:00:18.090> the<00:00:18.150> way<00:00:18.300> this<00:00:18.480> red<00:00:18.750> blue

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
a distributor by the way this red blue

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.170 
a distributor by the way this red blue
thing<00:00:19.590> there's<00:00:20.189> a<00:00:20.310> shaft<00:00:20.609> that<00:00:20.820> goes<00:00:20.939> all<00:00:21.150> the

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
thing there's a shaft that goes all the

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:22.970 
thing there's a shaft that goes all the
way<00:00:21.270> down<00:00:21.359> that's<00:00:21.720> what<00:00:21.930> spins<00:00:22.439> around<00:00:22.650> and

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
way down that's what spins around and

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.130 
way down that's what spins around and
distributes<00:00:23.789> the<00:00:23.939> spark<00:00:24.269> to<00:00:24.510> different

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
distributes the spark to different

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.009 
distributes the spark to different
sparkplug<00:00:25.560> wires<00:00:25.970> then<00:00:26.970> it<00:00:27.119> went<00:00:27.300> and<00:00:27.660> I

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
sparkplug wires then it went and I

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.089 
sparkplug wires then it went and I
installed<00:00:28.740> the<00:00:29.640> headers<00:00:30.330> now<00:00:30.840> this<00:00:31.769> is<00:00:31.980> the

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
installed the headers now this is the

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.610 
installed the headers now this is the
passenger-side<00:00:32.790> header<00:00:33.750> and<00:00:33.989> I<00:00:34.020> put<00:00:34.260> that<00:00:34.410> one

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
passenger-side header and I put that one

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.490 
passenger-side header and I put that one
on<00:00:34.680> first<00:00:35.130> and<00:00:35.489> then<00:00:36.450> went<00:00:36.660> over<00:00:36.780> here<00:00:37.290> to

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
on first and then went over here to

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.040 
on first and then went over here to
install<00:00:38.100> the<00:00:38.430> driver<00:00:38.790> side<00:00:39.120> at<00:00:39.420> which<00:00:39.600> point<00:00:39.899> I

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
install the driver side at which point I

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.369 
install the driver side at which point I
went<00:00:40.230> back<00:00:40.410> over<00:00:40.800> here<00:00:41.040> to<00:00:41.250> uninstall<00:00:42.379> the

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
went back over here to uninstall the

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.410 
went back over here to uninstall the
passenger<00:00:44.040> side<00:00:44.250> header<00:00:44.579> because<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:45.180> motor

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
passenger side header because the motor

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.720 
passenger side header because the motor
needs<00:00:45.750> to<00:00:46.050> tilt<00:00:46.350> up<00:00:46.620> and<00:00:47.690> over<00:00:49.160> so<00:00:50.160> that<00:00:50.190> this

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
needs to tilt up and over so that this

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.819 
needs to tilt up and over so that this
one<00:00:51.030> can<00:00:51.930> fit<00:00:52.199> in<00:00:52.379> first<00:00:53.420> so<00:00:54.420> now<00:00:55.410> with<00:00:55.620> no

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
one can fit in first so now with no

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.580 
one can fit in first so now with no
headers<00:00:56.250> on<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:56.789> car<00:00:57.059> I<00:00:57.360> go<00:00:57.780> underneath<00:00:59.390> and

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:00.590 
headers on the car I go underneath and

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:03.560 
headers on the car I go underneath and
put<00:01:01.590> floor<00:01:01.920> jacks<00:01:02.250> down<00:01:02.579> there<00:01:02.879> till<00:01:03.149> do<00:01:03.329> that

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
put floor jacks down there till do that

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.160 
put floor jacks down there till do that
worked<00:01:05.090> which<00:01:06.090> point<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:06.510> motor<00:01:06.689> falls<00:01:06.930> off

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
worked which point the motor falls off

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.410 
worked which point the motor falls off
the<00:01:07.350> floor<00:01:07.590> jacks<00:01:07.890> and<00:01:08.100> almost<00:01:08.430> pins<00:01:08.970> my<00:01:09.180> hand

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
the floor jacks and almost pins my hand

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.750 
the floor jacks and almost pins my hand
under<00:01:09.750> there<00:01:09.869> so<00:01:10.049> that<00:01:10.200> was<00:01:10.320> a<00:01:10.350> dumb<00:01:10.560> idea<00:01:10.950> so

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
under there so that was a dumb idea so

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:17.090 
under there so that was a dumb idea so
crawl<00:01:12.060> out<00:01:13.220> and<00:01:14.220> put<00:01:14.610> the<00:01:15.530> engine<00:01:16.530> hoist<00:01:16.740> back

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
crawl out and put the engine hoist back

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:22.100 
crawl out and put the engine hoist back
together<00:01:19.280> jack<00:01:20.280> up<00:01:20.549> the<00:01:20.700> car<00:01:20.729> the<00:01:21.240> motor<00:01:21.750> the

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
together jack up the car the motor the

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.640 
together jack up the car the motor the
right<00:01:22.290> way<00:01:22.500> that<00:01:22.799> motor<00:01:23.100> mount<00:01:23.369> is<00:01:24.210> still<00:01:24.720> I'll

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
right way that motor mount is still I'll

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.260 
right way that motor mount is still I'll
show<00:01:25.860> you<00:01:25.920> that<00:01:26.280> motor<00:01:26.549> mount<00:01:26.790> is<00:01:26.970> still

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
show you that motor mount is still

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:33.319 
show you that motor mount is still
attached<00:01:27.659> and<00:01:30.470> there<00:01:31.470> it<00:01:31.560> is<00:01:31.680> and<00:01:32.159> all<00:01:32.970> bolts

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
attached and there it is and all bolts

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.050 
attached and there it is and all bolts
it<00:01:33.420> in<00:01:33.540> there<00:01:33.950> this<00:01:34.950> one<00:01:35.220> I<00:01:35.430> don't<00:01:35.820> know<00:01:35.880> if<00:01:36.000> you

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
it in there this one I don't know if you

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.340 
it in there this one I don't know if you
can<00:01:36.150> see<00:01:36.360> that<00:01:36.540> properly

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
can see that properly

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.740 
can see that properly
there's<00:01:38.130> no<00:01:38.280> bolt<00:01:38.579> in<00:01:38.759> that<00:01:38.909> so<00:01:39.150> the<00:01:39.360> motor<00:01:39.540> can

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
there's no bolt in that so the motor can

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.990 
there's no bolt in that so the motor can
rotate<00:01:39.960> over<00:01:40.320> and<00:01:40.500> still<00:01:40.890> stay<00:01:41.100> fairly<00:01:41.460> solid

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
rotate over and still stay fairly solid

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.480 
rotate over and still stay fairly solid
in<00:01:42.119> here<00:01:42.360> jack<00:01:42.990> up<00:01:43.170> the<00:01:43.259> motor<00:01:43.470> put<00:01:44.159> in<00:01:44.280> that

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
in here jack up the motor put in that

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.300 
in here jack up the motor put in that
header<00:01:45.140> that<00:01:46.140> took<00:01:46.409> a<00:01:46.530> while<00:01:46.680> you<00:01:46.860> lower<00:01:47.100> the

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
header that took a while you lower the

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:48.800 
header that took a while you lower the
motor<00:01:47.460> down<00:01:47.700> a<00:01:47.729> little<00:01:48.000> bit<00:01:48.149> put<00:01:48.360> a<00:01:48.390> bolt<00:01:48.630> in

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
motor down a little bit put a bolt in

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.450 
motor down a little bit put a bolt in
twist<00:01:49.170> it<00:01:49.350> a<00:01:49.409> little<00:01:49.590> bit<00:01:49.740> put<00:01:49.920> the<00:01:50.040> other<00:01:50.159> bolt

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
twist it a little bit put the other bolt

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.100 
twist it a little bit put the other bolt
in<00:01:50.670> then<00:01:50.880> lift<00:01:51.119> it<00:01:51.270> back<00:01:51.390> up<00:01:51.450> so<00:01:51.689> you<00:01:51.869> get<00:01:51.960> your

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
in then lift it back up so you get your

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.050 
in then lift it back up so you get your
fingers<00:01:52.439> in<00:01:52.590> there<00:01:52.799> and<00:01:52.829> you<00:01:53.100> tighten<00:01:53.850> all

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
fingers in there and you tighten all

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.389 
fingers in there and you tighten all
that<00:01:54.240> up<00:01:54.390> went<00:01:55.320> over<00:01:55.530> and<00:01:55.649> put<00:01:55.770> this<00:01:55.950> one<00:01:56.130> in<00:01:56.280> it
