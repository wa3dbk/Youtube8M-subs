know<00:01:32.880> whether<00:01:33.060> that<00:01:33.299> means<00:01:33.390> that<00:01:33.630> if<00:01:33.750> you

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
know whether that means that if you

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.270 
know whether that means that if you
replace<00:01:34.200> the<00:01:34.350> shield<00:01:34.590> of<00:01:34.710> zombies<00:01:34.979> would<00:01:35.070> come

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
replace the shield of zombies would come

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.859 
replace the shield of zombies would come
and<00:01:35.400> destroyed<00:01:35.700> because<00:01:36.390> that's<00:01:36.720> something

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
and destroyed because that's something

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.420 
and destroyed because that's something
that<00:01:37.049> I<00:01:37.200> used<00:01:37.439> to<00:01:37.500> like<00:01:37.710> get<00:01:37.890> rid<00:01:38.009> of<00:01:38.040> shields

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
that I used to like get rid of shields

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.030 
that I used to like get rid of shields
and<00:01:38.490> stuff<00:01:38.729> so<00:01:39.060> I'm<00:01:39.840> not<00:01:40.290> too<00:01:40.409> sure<00:01:40.619> how<00:01:40.829> that's

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
and stuff so I'm not too sure how that's

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.679 
and stuff so I'm not too sure how that's
gonna<00:01:41.130> thank<00:01:41.490> zombies<00:01:41.939> but<00:01:42.119> I'm<00:01:42.420> looking

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
gonna thank zombies but I'm looking

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.630 
gonna thank zombies but I'm looking
forward<00:01:42.869> to<00:01:43.020> seeing<00:01:43.200> how<00:01:43.409> it<00:01:43.530> works<00:01:43.710> also

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
forward to seeing how it works also

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.569 
forward to seeing how it works also
apparently<00:01:45.479> I<00:01:45.720> didn't<00:01:46.200> know<00:01:46.470> that<00:01:46.890> this<00:01:47.310> was<00:01:47.369> a

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
apparently I didn't know that this was a

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:48.889 
apparently I didn't know that this was a
glitch<00:01:47.880> but<00:01:48.060> apparently<00:01:48.420> you're<00:01:48.509> able<00:01:48.720> to<00:01:48.780> get

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
glitch but apparently you're able to get

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.289 
glitch but apparently you're able to get
more<00:01:49.049> blundergat<00:01:49.409> than<00:01:49.799> intended<00:01:50.100> I'm<00:01:50.460> fairly

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
more blundergat than intended I'm fairly

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:52.399 
more blundergat than intended I'm fairly
sure<00:01:51.420> that<00:01:51.540> they're<00:01:51.810> not<00:01:51.899> talking<00:01:52.200> about<00:01:52.259> the

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
sure that they're not talking about the

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.469 
sure that they're not talking about the
two<00:01:52.530> blender<00:01:52.860> gets<00:01:53.070> because<00:01:53.369> it<00:01:53.729> I<00:01:53.939> the<00:01:54.329> way<00:01:54.450> I

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
two blender gets because it I the way I

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:55.730 
two blender gets because it I the way I
know<00:01:54.630> it<00:01:54.899> is<00:01:54.990> you<00:01:55.020> can<00:01:55.229> get<00:01:55.320> one<00:01:55.500> out<00:01:55.590> of<00:01:55.680> the

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
know it is you can get one out of the

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.190 
know it is you can get one out of the
box<00:01:55.920> and<00:01:56.130> then<00:01:56.340> one<00:01:56.520> from<00:01:56.700> the<00:01:56.790> skulls<00:01:57.200> but

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
box and then one from the skulls but

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.899 
box and then one from the skulls but
maybe<00:01:58.590> there's<00:01:58.799> a<00:01:58.860> way<00:01:58.950> for<00:01:59.369> you<00:01:59.430> to<00:01:59.490> get<00:01:59.610> more

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
maybe there's a way for you to get more

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.730 
maybe there's a way for you to get more
I<00:02:00.210> think<00:02:00.570> I've<00:02:00.659> seen<00:02:00.810> a<00:02:00.869> glitch<00:02:01.110> tutorial<00:02:01.290> on

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
I think I've seen a glitch tutorial on

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.260 
I think I've seen a glitch tutorial on
how<00:02:01.770> to<00:02:01.890> get<00:02:02.070> like<00:02:02.250> five<00:02:02.759> of<00:02:02.790> them<00:02:03.000> or

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.490 
happened to me in two different ways one
way<00:02:25.070> was<00:02:25.400> that<00:02:25.580> on<00:02:25.880> our<00:02:26.390> way<00:02:26.720> of<00:02:27.050> buying<00:02:27.380> the

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
way was that on our way of buying the

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:28.870 
way was that on our way of buying the
gondolas<00:02:27.950> moving<00:02:27.980> to<00:02:28.340> another<00:02:28.520> direction

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:28.880 
gondolas moving to another direction

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.080 
gondolas moving to another direction
that<00:02:29.750> when<00:02:29.930> we<00:02:30.110> bought<00:02:30.350> it<00:02:30.380> it<00:02:30.790> made<00:02:31.790> me<00:02:31.940> go

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
that when we bought it it made me go

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:33.490 
that when we bought it it made me go
down<00:02:32.360> because<00:02:32.690> there<00:02:32.780> was<00:02:32.870> a<00:02:32.900> zombie<00:02:33.170> in<00:02:33.410> there

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
down because there was a zombie in there

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.140 
down because there was a zombie in there
that's<00:02:33.710> why<00:02:33.890> we<00:02:34.070> stayed<00:02:34.280> in<00:02:34.310> oh<00:02:34.430> gosh<00:02:34.910> I'm

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
gondola started with my friend Bree

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:49.630 
gondola started with my friend Bree
bought<00:02:48.140> the<00:02:48.290> gondola<00:02:48.710> to<00:02:48.830> seafood<00:02:49.160> save<00:02:49.490> me

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
bought the gondola to seafood save me

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.210 
bought the gondola to seafood save me
and<00:02:49.820> it<00:02:50.570> allowed<00:02:50.870> me<00:02:50.900> to<00:02:51.380> get<00:02:51.560> out<00:02:51.740> of<00:02:51.770> the<00:02:51.980> map

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
and it allowed me to get out of the map

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:55.030 
and it allowed me to get out of the map
for<00:02:52.970> just<00:02:53.180> a<00:02:53.270> short<00:02:53.420> period<00:02:53.720> of<00:02:53.840> time<00:02:53.930> but<00:02:54.770> my

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040 
for just a short period of time but my

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:56.440 
for just a short period of time but my
wondering<00:02:55.430> is<00:02:55.610> whether<00:02:55.820> or<00:02:55.940> not<00:02:56.030> it's<00:02:56.210> talking

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 
wondering is whether or not it's talking

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:57.730 
wondering is whether or not it's talking
about<00:02:56.570> that<00:02:56.780> or<00:02:57.020> if<00:02:57.170> it's<00:02:57.320> talking<00:02:57.530> about<00:02:57.650> the

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:57.740 
about that or if it's talking about the

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:59.200 
about that or if it's talking about the
more<00:02:57.890> common<00:02:58.190> one<00:02:58.370> toward<00:02:58.640> if<00:02:58.730> there's<00:02:58.910> a<00:02:58.970> lag

00:02:59.200 --> 00:02:59.210 
more common one toward if there's a lag

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:01.090 
more common one toward if there's a lag
spike<00:02:59.480> or<00:02:59.660> if<00:02:59.720> you're<00:02:59.810> lagging<00:03:00.100> you'd

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:01.100 
spike or if you're lagging you'd

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:03.160 
spike or if you're lagging you'd
sometimes<00:03:01.610> just<00:03:01.790> fall<00:03:02.210> out<00:03:02.240> of<00:03:02.390> the<00:03:02.510> gondola<00:03:02.990> I

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170 
sometimes just fall out of the gondola I

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:06.310 
sometimes just fall out of the gondola I
am<00:03:03.500> I'm<00:03:03.740> looking<00:03:04.400> forward<00:03:04.730> to<00:03:04.820> see<00:03:05.290> which<00:03:06.290> one

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:06.320 
am I'm looking forward to see which one

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:07.930 
am I'm looking forward to see which one
it<00:03:06.620> is<00:03:06.650> whether<00:03:06.980> or<00:03:07.070> not<00:03:07.220> it's<00:03:07.430> the<00:03:07.490> one<00:03:07.760> word

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:07.940 
it is whether or not it's the one word

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:09.130 
it is whether or not it's the one word
if<00:03:08.060> you<00:03:08.120> go<00:03:08.270> down<00:03:08.480> whether<00:03:08.810> or<00:03:08.900> not<00:03:08.960> it's<00:03:09.110> the

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:09.140 
if you go down whether or not it's the

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:10.780 
if you go down whether or not it's the
lag<00:03:09.380> or<00:03:09.560> hopefully<00:03:09.980> it's<00:03:10.130> the<00:03:10.280> combination<00:03:10.490> of

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:10.790 
lag or hopefully it's the combination of

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:12.640 
lag or hopefully it's the combination of
the<00:03:10.910> both<00:03:11.030> and<00:03:11.300> you<00:03:11.870> can't<00:03:12.080> follow<00:03:12.230> the

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.650 
the both and you can't follow the

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:14.610 
the both and you can't follow the
gondola<00:03:13.130> because<00:03:13.370> i<00:03:13.550> hate<00:03:13.820> the<00:03:13.910> condylar<00:03:14.330> now

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:14.620 
gondola because i hate the condylar now

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:17.170 
gondola because i hate the condylar now

improved and expanded who can host the

00:04:42.009 --> 00:04:44.339 
improved and expanded who can host the
game<00:04:42.250> of<00:04:42.460> a<00:04:42.610> lobby<00:04:42.879> I<00:04:43.210> don't<00:04:43.960> know<00:04:44.020> whether<00:04:44.229> or

00:04:44.339 --> 00:04:44.349 
game of a lobby I don't know whether or

00:04:44.349 --> 00:04:45.689 
game of a lobby I don't know whether or
not<00:04:44.470> that's<00:04:44.740> a<00:04:44.860> good<00:04:45.129> thing<00:04:45.280> or<00:04:45.400> a<00:04:45.490> bad<00:04:45.520> thing

00:04:45.689 --> 00:04:45.699 
not that's a good thing or a bad thing

00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:47.520 
not that's a good thing or a bad thing
because<00:04:45.940> when<00:04:46.120> I<00:04:46.180> think<00:04:46.389> of<00:04:46.419> it<00:04:46.509> now<00:04:46.690> the<00:04:47.289> host

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:47.530 
because when I think of it now the host

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:50.369 
because when I think of it now the host
that<00:04:47.710> they<00:04:47.800> choose<00:04:48.509> aren't<00:04:49.509> aren't<00:04:49.750> really

00:04:50.369 --> 00:04:50.379 
that they choose aren't aren't really

00:04:50.379 --> 00:04:52.890 
that they choose aren't aren't really
good<00:04:50.979> hosts<00:04:51.490> I<00:04:51.699> don't<00:04:51.879> think<00:04:52.090> I<00:04:52.150> like<00:04:52.449> the<00:04:52.659> fact

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:52.900 
good hosts I don't think I like the fact

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:54.270 
good hosts I don't think I like the fact
that<00:04:53.080> they're<00:04:53.259> gonna<00:04:53.349> widen<00:04:53.650> the<00:04:53.949> gap<00:04:54.220> to

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:54.280 
that they're gonna widen the gap to

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:56.700 
that they're gonna widen the gap to
allow<00:04:54.639> more<00:04:54.940> people<00:04:55.000> to<00:04:55.330> become<00:04:55.509> hosts<00:04:56.080> but<00:04:56.620> it

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:56.710 
allow more people to become hosts but it

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:58.649 
allow more people to become hosts but it
does<00:04:56.889> say<00:04:57.099> they<00:04:57.250> improve<00:04:57.789> and<00:04:58.090> expand<00:04:58.479> it<00:04:58.599> I

00:04:58.649 --> 00:04:58.659 
does say they improve and expand it I

00:04:58.659 --> 00:05:00.360 
does say they improve and expand it I
don't<00:04:58.780> know<00:04:58.810> if<00:04:58.930> that<00:04:59.080> means<00:04:59.259> that<00:04:59.590> they've

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:00.370 
don't know if that means that they've

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:01.890 
don't know if that means that they've
changed<00:05:00.729> it<00:05:00.849> to<00:05:01.030> where<00:05:01.120> they're<00:05:01.330> moving<00:05:01.780> the

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:01.900 
changed it to where they're moving the

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:03.480

getting the median guys and the good
guys<00:05:11.500> I<00:05:11.770> guess<00:05:12.039> that<00:05:12.250> could<00:05:12.370> be<00:05:12.400> a<00:05:12.490> good<00:05:12.699> thing

00:05:12.749 --> 00:05:12.759 
guys I guess that could be a good thing

00:05:12.759 --> 00:05:16.020 
guys I guess that could be a good thing
but<00:05:13.419> I<00:05:13.720> guess<00:05:14.560> I'm<00:05:14.680> gonna<00:05:14.770> have<00:05:14.830> to<00:05:15.030> I'm

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:16.030 
but I guess I'm gonna have to I'm

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:18.089 
but I guess I'm gonna have to I'm
skeptical<00:05:16.599> on<00:05:17.020> how<00:05:17.289> this<00:05:17.500> is<00:05:17.620> gonna<00:05:17.680> work<00:05:17.800> out

00:05:18.089 --> 00:05:18.099 
skeptical on how this is gonna work out

00:05:18.099 --> 00:05:20.550 
skeptical on how this is gonna work out
I<00:05:18.340> hate<00:05:18.580> the<00:05:18.729> hosting<00:05:19.060> right<00:05:19.180> now<00:05:19.409> let's<00:05:20.409> go<00:05:20.500> to

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:20.560 
I hate the hosting right now let's go to

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:22.080 
I hate the hosting right now let's go to
move<00:05:20.770> on<00:05:20.889> to<00:05:21.039> some<00:05:21.190> other<00:05:21.250> multiplayer<00:05:21.639> issues

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:22.090 
move on to some other multiplayer issues

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:23.999 
move on to some other multiplayer issues
so<00:05:22.840> let's<00:05:23.050> go<00:05:23.199> ahead<00:05:23.229> and<00:05:23.440> move<00:05:23.620> on<00:05:23.770> to<00:05:23.800> this

00:05:23.999 --> 00:05:24.009 
so let's go ahead and move on to this

00:05:24.009 --> 00:05:26.909 
so let's go ahead and move on to this
where<00:05:24.280> um<00:05:24.520> it<00:05:25.389> they<00:05:25.990> fixed<00:05:26.379> the<00:05:26.440> part<00:05:26.710> where

00:05:26.909 --> 00:05:26.919 
where um it they fixed the part where

00:05:26.919 --> 00:05:28.559 
where um it they fixed the part where
the<00:05:27.039> radicals<00:05:27.550> would<00:05:27.789> sometimes<00:05:28.210> disappear

00:05:28.559 --> 00:05:28.569 
the radicals would sometimes disappear

00:05:28.569 --> 00:05:29.969 
the radicals would sometimes disappear
and<00:05:28.960> I<00:05:29.050> know<00:05:29.110> about<00:05:29.229> you<00:05:29.440> guys<00:05:29.590> but<00:05:29.650> I've

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:31.690 
actually had just happen to me at least

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:33.600 
actually had just happen to me at least
10<00:05:31.930> times<00:05:32.169> in<00:05:32.409> different<00:05:32.530> games<00:05:32.860> and<00:05:33.430> it<00:05:33.520> was

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:33.610 
10 times in different games and it was

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:35.189 
10 times in different games and it was
quite<00:05:33.789> frustrating<00:05:34.330> because<00:05:34.419> I<00:05:34.719> like<00:05:34.900> to<00:05:35.050> run

00:05:35.189 --> 00:05:35.199 
quite frustrating because I like to run

00:05:35.199 --> 00:05:38.129 
quite frustrating because I like to run
either<00:05:36.000> red<00:05:37.000> dot<00:05:37.180> sights<00:05:37.449> or<00:05:37.659> millimeter

00:05:39.899 --> 00:05:39.909 
scanners or some other variables of

00:05:39.909 --> 00:05:43.980 
scanners or some other variables of
sites<00:05:40.300> because<00:05:40.569> I<00:05:40.750> like<00:05:41.199> sites<00:05:41.979> and<00:05:42.690> it's<00:05:43.690> not

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:43.990 
sites because I like sites and it's not

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:45.839 
sites because I like sites and it's not
that<00:05:44.020> it<00:05:44.319> was<00:05:44.440> completely<00:05:44.889> blinded<00:05:45.370> but<00:05:45.580> I<00:05:45.639> was

00:05:45.839 --> 00:05:45.849 
that it was completely blinded but I was

00:05:45.849 --> 00:05:47.670 
that it was completely blinded but I was
at<00:05:45.969> a<00:05:46.000> slight<00:05:46.300> disadvantage<00:05:46.690> not<00:05:47.259> knowing

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:47.680 
at a slight disadvantage not knowing

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:49.620 
at a slight disadvantage not knowing
where<00:05:48.219> the<00:05:48.340> center<00:05:48.580> was<00:05:48.849> although<00:05:49.389> my

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:49.630 
where the center was although my

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:51.880 
constant use of these sites a lot of me

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:53.909 
constant use of these sites a lot of me
to<00:05:52.000> go<00:05:52.060> okay<00:05:52.690> you<00:05:52.750> know<00:05:52.960> it's<00:05:53.349> roughly<00:05:53.770> about

00:05:53.909 --> 00:05:53.919 
to go okay you know it's roughly about

00:05:53.919 --> 00:05:55.740 
to go okay you know it's roughly about
here<00:05:54.279> but<00:05:54.669> still<00:05:54.880> those<00:05:55.000> an<00:05:55.120> inconvenience<00:05:55.690> to
