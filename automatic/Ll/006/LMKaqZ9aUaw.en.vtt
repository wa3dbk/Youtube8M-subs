00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.370
 Hello all friends with you marakasi and you 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:06.750
 see the transfer of gorgeous positions 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.000
 issue 105 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.910
 and we will start from the position on the map 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.219
 northwest squared d 0 you 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.500
 require unnoticed potential with 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:19.380
 powerful tool well suited 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.869
 Vaffenturger Barsik on this position and you 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.630
 can easily climb it does not require 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:27.439
 you have plenty of time which of course is 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:33.030
 plus you can do well 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:34.800
 sweep through the squares of g7 g8 and there often 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.190
 appear opponents they attack 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:41.010
 It is substituted and you will be able to 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:43.649
 well damage the whole from this position in 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.950
 Most cases can be applied a lot 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:49.980
 damage to the same thing you shoot from far 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:52.440
 the distance here is of course large and therefore 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.809
 you must not be lit that is you 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.780
 be here in complete safety and 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:00.449
 can perfectly sniper opponents 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:03.480
 the disadvantage of this position is that 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:06.060
 if opponents do not appear you just 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.670
 here you will be wasted and thus 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.799
 spend time at least one protasov this 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.280
 not so critical but still it will be 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:15.570
 unpleasant though in most cases 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.700
 there will always be some enemy 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.799
 be substituted and you can on it 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.689
 to shoot 

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:24.869
 next comes the point on lasville map and in 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:28.070
 square e2 and you need a quick 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:31.170
 small and light tank drive in here 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:33.930
 reversing will be so much easier and 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:36.030
 faster though of course this position 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:39.060
 takes quite a long time to 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:41.689
 come here nevertheless here basically 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.759
 you can bring a lot of value to the team 

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:47.310
 for example, you can simply highlight if 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:50.399
 you are not very strong in the team 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.710
 You can also shoot at enemies especially 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:55.079
 It is effective to do with the drum that is 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:59.040
 hang out while the enemies are there of magnitude 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:02:01.590
 soot enter them drum and drive off 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:04.530
 back to recharge the whole from here you 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:07.290
 well you shoot almost the whole gorge 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.990
 excellent sweep squares to 1 to 2 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:12.810
 where every pt-sau and art often shines 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:15.420
 and they are often unavailable to your 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:17.970
 allies but you can perfectly for them 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:21.480
 shoot well shot too 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:24.750
 The square of f2 and g1 is generally very 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:27.870
 interesting. next location 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:30.810
 located on the map fjords in square d 4 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:33.780
 you will need fast i tried good 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:35.850
 masking is great t67 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:39.000
 notice how you need here 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:41.670
 it is easier to climb that way and 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:45.120
 it's safer to call in this position and you 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:48.150
 don't spend as much time as you can 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:50.220
 see a pretty high position from here 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:53.300
 you will be able to reach those enemies who 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:56.220
 not usually available to your allies and 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:58.500
 besides because of the long distance not 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:01.069
 you will always be very shining here 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:06.330
 okay from here you shoot squares 

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:08.730
 a8 and a9 and six and seven and g6 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:11.400
 if opponents appear there then you 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:13.709
 be able to shoot them at high 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:16.019
 levels here of course the chance of your glare 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:18.150
 pretty tall so i advise 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:20.250
 use the location position on 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:22.880
 low levels there fifth and sixth 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:26.310
 then you can be here for a long time 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:29.209
 shoot a lot of damage and will not 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:33.200
 This is very original 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:33.200
 I advise everyone to try the location 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:39.280
 next is the entertaining position on 

00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:41.590
 map swamp squared. 9 and you 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:44.620
 you will need little fish invisible 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:47.290
 tank with a good view and go here 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:49.780
 only if your allies 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:52.569
 not crossed in Moscow and they are not particularly 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:55.959
 tend to go on the attack and in the herd somewhere 

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:58.120
 next to the defa in this case your for light 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:04:00.730
 will be extremely effective and besides 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:03.879
 enemies will see your allies near 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:06.489
 there is no change and go to attack thereby 

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:09.040
 it will be easier to light the whole very 

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:11.680
 good position you are here in 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:14.739
 safety and shine well 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:17.530
 your allies can tune in well 

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:20.260
 according to your light, especially if your 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:22.570
 team a lot of art then in principle 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:25.120
 you can make out from the quantity under here 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:27.910
 enemies and they won't even understand who 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:30.190
 they shine to the disadvantage of this position 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:32.440
 can be attributed to the fact that if opponents 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:35.590
 will move the bridge then most likely they are you 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:38.410
 will light and disassemble it is therefore very important 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:41.169
 to allies control bridge and not 

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:43.349
 let the enemies just drive through 

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:43.349
 him 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:53.830
 and the last position today is 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:57.430
 on the map nhl u in square g3 you 

00:04:53.830 --> 00:05:00.129
 need inconspicuous pt-sau and better 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:02.229
 so she was low because 

00:05:00.129 --> 00:05:05.710
 on high of course there is a chance to shine 

00:05:02.229 --> 00:05:06.729
 will be very big but on low there 

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:09.750
 fifth and sixth 

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:13.629
 can be quite safe here 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:16.659
 water shoots very well from here 

00:05:13.629 --> 00:05:19.990
 that is, if opponents will press on 

00:05:16.659 --> 00:05:22.000
 right flank bottom on the water then you 

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:24.729
 you can shoot them well and 

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.469
 naturally shine you here no one 

00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:28.690
 will be but if only some 

00:05:26.469 --> 00:05:30.969
 crazy all fly there in the center 

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:33.729
 maybe only then he will light you 

00:05:30.969 --> 00:05:34.870
 but in principle there can be quite quickly 

00:05:33.729 --> 00:05:38.740
 to hide 

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:40.659
 Naturally, a light bulb is necessary except 

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:43.270
 it is worth noting that from here is good 

00:05:40.659 --> 00:05:45.340
 sweep through the whole center if enemies 

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:48.699
 there will light up again, you can 

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:51.430
 safe to shoot at them and at this 

00:05:48.699 --> 00:05:52.180
 all friends thanks for watching wish you 

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:55.560
 good luck 

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:55.560
 see you soon
