00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
things we're suggesting that it might

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.340 
things we're suggesting that it might
even<00:03:33.190> possibly<00:03:33.730> be<00:03:33.970> three<00:03:34.300> hundred<00:03:34.330> dollars<00:03:35.050> I

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:35.350 
even possibly be three hundred dollars I

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:38.300 
even possibly be three hundred dollars I
don't<00:03:36.220> know<00:03:36.400> if<00:03:36.610> that's<00:03:36.790> really

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
don't know if that's really

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:40.890 
don't know if that's really
realistically<00:03:39.310> speaking<00:03:39.640> there<00:03:40.300> but<00:03:40.690> that

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:40.900 
realistically speaking there but that

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:43.440 
realistically speaking there but that
might<00:03:41.080> be<00:03:41.110> like<00:03:41.380> a<00:03:41.410> light<00:03:41.770> version<00:03:41.800> of<00:03:42.670> the<00:03:42.820> 720

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:43.450 
might be like a light version of the 720

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:44.729 
might be like a light version of the 720
and<00:03:43.600> then<00:03:44.020> they'll<00:03:44.170> have<00:03:44.290> like<00:03:44.410> a<00:03:44.470> more

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:44.739 
and then they'll have like a more

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:46.470 
and then they'll have like a more
expensive<00:03:45.040> version<00:03:45.580> like<00:03:45.730> they've<00:03:45.910> said<00:03:46.180> so

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:46.480 
expensive version like they've said so

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.510 
expensive version like they've said so
