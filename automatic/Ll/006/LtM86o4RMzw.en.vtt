okay<00:00:11.980> you<00:00:12.980> can<00:00:13.130> see<00:00:13.309> I<00:00:13.640> applied<00:00:14.320> weathering

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:15.320 
okay you can see I applied weathering

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:17.019 
okay you can see I applied weathering
powder<00:00:15.530> this<00:00:15.769> isn't<00:00:16.099> the<00:00:16.160> one<00:00:16.340> we<00:00:16.460> just<00:00:16.490> did<00:00:16.730> of

00:00:17.019 --> 00:00:17.029 
powder this isn't the one we just did of

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:21.359 
powder this isn't the one we just did of
course<00:00:17.060> this<00:00:17.480> is<00:00:17.630> why<00:00:17.750> I<00:00:17.779> showed<00:00:18.019> you<00:00:19.869> but<00:00:20.869> I

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:21.369 
course this is why I showed you but I

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:24.580 
course this is why I showed you but I
did<00:00:22.369> whether<00:00:23.210> the<00:00:23.510> rims<00:00:23.869> to<00:00:24.199> make<00:00:24.350> them<00:00:24.470> look

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:24.590 
did whether the rims to make them look

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:29.019 
did whether the rims to make them look
like<00:00:24.650> rust<00:00:25.130> and<00:00:27.340> applied<00:00:28.340> weathering<00:00:28.789> powder

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:29.029 
like rust and applied weathering powder

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:35.650 
like rust and applied weathering powder
to<00:00:29.660> the<00:00:29.840> tire<00:00:30.050> itself<00:00:32.920> the<00:00:33.920> first<00:00:34.190> thing<00:00:34.660> like

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:35.660 
to the tire itself the first thing like

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:38.860 
to the tire itself the first thing like
I<00:00:35.780> said<00:00:35.989> this<00:00:36.140> is<00:00:36.320> from<00:00:36.500> a<00:00:36.590> 250<00:00:37.100> GTO<00:00:37.489> I<00:00:37.970> did<00:00:38.660> some

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:38.870 
I said this is from a 250 GTO I did some

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:41.380 
I said this is from a 250 GTO I did some
other<00:00:39.050> ones<00:00:39.260> of<00:00:39.620> it<00:00:39.770> you<00:00:40.579> can<00:00:40.730> see<00:00:40.910> this<00:00:41.120> side

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:41.390 
other ones of it you can see this side

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:46.240 
other ones of it you can see this side
of<00:00:41.630> it<00:00:41.780> is<00:00:42.430> there's<00:00:43.430> no<00:00:43.670> rust<00:00:44.660> on<00:00:44.960> that<00:00:45.200> I<00:00:45.440> did

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:46.250 
of it is there's no rust on that I did

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:48.490 
of it is there's no rust on that I did
that<00:00:46.430> on<00:00:46.550> purpose<00:00:46.579> i<00:00:47.180> weathered<00:00:47.840> this<00:00:48.200> while

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:48.500 
that on purpose i weathered this while

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.170 
that on purpose i weathered this while
it<00:00:48.680> was<00:00:48.829> sitting<00:00:49.250> so<00:00:49.280> that<00:00:49.610> everything<00:00:50.030> would

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:50.180 
it was sitting so that everything would

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:52.209 
it was sitting so that everything would
collect<00:00:50.570> in<00:00:50.690> the<00:00:50.809> bottom<00:00:51.230> because<00:00:51.920> if

00:00:52.209 --> 00:00:52.219 
collect in the bottom because if

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:54.520 
collect in the bottom because if
something's<00:00:52.579> gonna<00:00:52.760> rest<00:00:53.290> eventually<00:00:54.290> it<00:00:54.410> all

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:54.530 
something's gonna rest eventually it all

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:56.049 
something's gonna rest eventually it all
runs<00:00:54.770> downhill<00:00:55.039> what<00:00:55.399> a<00:00:55.489> puddles<00:00:55.879> at<00:00:55.969> the

00:00:56.049 --> 00:00:56.059 
runs downhill what a puddles at the

00:00:56.059 --> 00:00:58.090 
runs downhill what a puddles at the
bottom<00:00:56.420> so<00:00:57.079> that's<00:00:57.140> the<00:00:57.350> reason<00:00:57.620> I<00:00:57.710> did<00:00:57.890> that<00:00:57.920> I

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:58.100 
bottom so that's the reason I did that I

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.500 
bottom so that's the reason I did that I
hope<00:00:58.430> you<00:00:58.579> can<00:00:58.610> see<00:00:59.000> that<00:00:59.030> in<00:00:59.420> there<00:01:01.510> what

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:02.510 
hope you can see that in there what

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:04.689 
hope you can see that in there what
we're<00:01:02.660> going<00:01:02.840> to<00:01:02.870> do<00:01:03.079> though<00:01:03.320> is<00:01:03.530> I<00:01:04.339> went<00:01:04.610> ahead

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:04.699 
we're going to do though is I went ahead

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:10.120 
we're going to do though is I went ahead
and<00:01:05.469> these<00:01:06.469> are<00:01:06.710> from<00:01:06.979> the<00:01:07.100> 166<00:01:08.200> I<00:01:09.200> painted

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:10.130 
and these are from the 166 I painted

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:15.940 
and these are from the 166 I painted
them<00:01:10.369> with<00:01:11.299> testers<00:01:13.359> enamel<00:01:14.359> rust<00:01:15.289> color<00:01:15.619> I

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:15.950 
them with testers enamel rust color I

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:17.889 
them with testers enamel rust color I
just<00:01:16.399> happened<00:01:16.729> to<00:01:16.819> come<00:01:16.939> across<00:01:17.090> it<00:01:17.479> it<00:01:17.719> goes

00:01:17.889 --> 00:01:17.899 
just happened to come across it it goes

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:20.039 
just happened to come across it it goes
right<00:01:18.020> with<00:01:18.319> what<00:01:18.469> we're<00:01:18.619> trying<00:01:18.799> to<00:01:18.950> do<00:01:19.159> here

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:20.049 
right with what we're trying to do here

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:24.429 
right with what we're trying to do here
so<00:01:21.049> I<00:01:21.700> went<00:01:22.700> ahead<00:01:22.789> and<00:01:23.029> use<00:01:23.179> that<00:01:23.450> it<00:01:23.810> is<00:01:24.409> a

00:01:24.429 --> 00:01:24.439 
so I went ahead and use that it is a

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:26.769 
so I went ahead and use that it is a
flat<00:01:24.770> enamel<00:01:25.310> you<00:01:25.520> do<00:01:26.149> not<00:01:26.299> want<00:01:26.569> to<00:01:26.630> use<00:01:26.749> a

00:01:26.769 --> 00:01:26.779 
flat enamel you do not want to use a

00:01:26.779 --> 00:01:28.599 
flat enamel you do not want to use a
gloss<00:01:27.109> even<00:01:27.799> though<00:01:27.920> it<00:01:28.039> kind<00:01:28.310> of<00:01:28.399> looks

00:01:28.599 --> 00:01:28.609 
gloss even though it kind of looks

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:31.769 
gloss even though it kind of looks
glossy<00:01:28.880> because<00:01:29.450> it's<00:01:29.630> painted<00:01:29.990> over<00:01:30.139> Chrome

00:01:31.769 --> 00:01:31.779 
glossy because it's painted over Chrome

00:01:31.779 --> 00:01:34.330 
glossy because it's painted over Chrome
you<00:01:32.779> might<00:01:32.990> want<00:01:33.200> to<00:01:33.229> put<00:01:33.439> couple<00:01:33.859> coats<00:01:34.069> on

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:34.340 
you might want to put couple coats on

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.459 
you might want to put couple coats on
there<00:01:34.520> maybe<00:01:34.789> that<00:01:35.090> would<00:01:35.270> have<00:01:35.359> helped<00:01:35.689> that

00:01:38.459 --> 00:01:38.469 

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:41.889 

the<00:01:39.469> reason<00:01:39.919> you<00:01:40.159> want<00:01:40.399> to<00:01:40.459> use<00:01:40.729> a<00:01:40.759> flat<00:01:41.240> enamel

00:01:41.889 --> 00:01:41.899 
the reason you want to use a flat enamel

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:45.219 
the reason you want to use a flat enamel
is<00:01:42.139> because<00:01:42.679> a<00:01:42.709> flat<00:01:43.209> paint<00:01:44.209> has<00:01:44.840> a<00:01:44.869> rough

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:45.229 
is because a flat paint has a rough

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:48.370 
is because a flat paint has a rough
texture<00:01:45.740> to<00:01:46.069> it<00:01:46.099> it<00:01:46.459> has<00:01:47.060> that's<00:01:47.569> reason<00:01:48.139> it's

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
texture to it it has that's reason it's

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:50.379 
texture to it it has that's reason it's
not<00:01:48.439> glossy<00:01:48.859> a<00:01:49.069> gloss<00:01:49.399> has<00:01:49.639> a<00:01:49.700> sheen<00:01:50.090> to<00:01:50.359> it

00:01:50.379 --> 00:01:50.389 
not glossy a gloss has a sheen to it

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:58.749 
not glossy a gloss has a sheen to it
it's<00:01:50.689> flat<00:01:53.380> with<00:01:54.380> the<00:01:54.409> flat<00:01:54.880> it's<00:01:57.549> it<00:01:58.549> has<00:01:58.579> a

00:01:58.749 --> 00:01:58.759 
it's flat with the flat it's it has a

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:01.359 
it's flat with the flat it's it has a
tooth<00:01:59.419> to<00:01:59.779> it<00:01:59.899> they<00:02:00.049> call<00:02:00.289> it<00:02:00.319> which<00:02:01.219> is

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:01.369 
tooth to it they call it which is

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:04.120 
tooth to it they call it which is

it's rust real rust and you just wash

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:45.440 
it's rust real rust and you just wash
this<00:02:38.819> on<00:02:42.170> and<00:02:43.489> you<00:02:44.489> put<00:02:44.730> it<00:02:44.819> all<00:02:44.940> over<00:02:45.000> that

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
this on and you put it all over that

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.160 
this on and you put it all over that
paint<00:02:45.810> that<00:02:46.110> you<00:02:46.260> have<00:02:47.540> now<00:02:48.540> this<00:02:48.720> will<00:02:48.930> not

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
paint that you have now this will not

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.800 
paint that you have now this will not
work<00:02:49.440> on<00:02:49.650> just<00:02:50.010> straight<00:02:50.579> chrome<00:02:51.000> that<00:02:51.569> will

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
work on just straight chrome that will

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.470 
work on just straight chrome that will
not<00:02:51.989> work<00:02:52.019> because<00:02:52.560> it<00:02:52.799> just<00:02:53.129> I<00:02:53.370> mean<00:02:54.180> you

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
not work because it just I mean you

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.839 
not work because it just I mean you
might<00:02:54.660> get<00:02:54.900> it<00:02:55.019> to<00:02:55.109> collect<00:02:55.470> but<00:02:56.250> not<00:02:56.310> like<00:02:56.700> you

00:02:56.839 --> 00:02:56.849 
might get it to collect but not like you

00:02:56.849 --> 00:02:58.580 
might get it to collect but not like you
will<00:02:57.000> to<00:02:57.120> flat<00:02:57.390> paint<00:02:57.660> that<00:02:57.930> is<00:02:58.109> just<00:02:58.349> that's

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
will to flat paint that is just that's

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:01.280 
will to flat paint that is just that's
probably<00:02:59.160> even<00:02:59.340> more<00:02:59.730> of<00:02:59.879> a<00:03:00.000> flat<00:03:00.480> surface<00:03:00.540> and

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
probably even more of a flat surface and

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:04.849 
probably even more of a flat surface and
I<00:03:01.620> shouldn't<00:03:01.980> say<00:03:02.160> flat<00:03:02.519> more<00:03:03.510> of<00:03:03.690> a<00:03:03.870> shiny

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:04.859 
I shouldn't say flat more of a shiny

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:11.960 
I shouldn't say flat more of a shiny
surface<00:03:06.049> than<00:03:07.549> even<00:03:08.549> a<00:03:08.819> gloss<00:03:09.299> paint<00:03:09.750> so<00:03:10.970> just

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
surface than even a gloss paint so just

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:14.390 
surface than even a gloss paint so just
you're<00:03:12.870> painting<00:03:13.410> this<00:03:13.560> on<00:03:13.769> there<00:03:13.980> but<00:03:14.160> it<00:03:14.250> is

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
you're painting this on there but it is

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.539 
you're painting this on there but it is
a<00:03:14.430> wash<00:03:15.019> like<00:03:16.019> I've<00:03:16.200> talked<00:03:16.530> about<00:03:16.829> before<00:03:17.069> on

00:03:17.539 --> 00:03:17.549 
a wash like I've talked about before on

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:20.150 
a wash like I've talked about before on
the<00:03:17.879> WRC<00:03:18.870> car<00:03:19.109> and<00:03:19.410> things<00:03:19.590> like<00:03:19.739> that<00:03:19.799> where

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
the WRC car and things like that where

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.339 
the WRC car and things like that where
I've<00:03:20.250> used<00:03:20.519> the<00:03:20.639> wash<00:03:20.849> on<00:03:21.090> there<00:03:21.329> before<00:03:21.660> it<00:03:22.109> is

00:03:22.339 --> 00:03:22.349 
I've used the wash on there before it is

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:26.150 
I've used the wash on there before it is
a<00:03:22.380> wash<00:03:22.709> itself<00:03:23.989> what<00:03:24.989> happens<00:03:25.380> is<00:03:25.560> is<00:03:25.769> you<00:03:25.799> put

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
a wash itself what happens is is you put

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.089 
a wash itself what happens is is you put
this<00:03:26.310> on<00:03:26.519> there<00:03:26.819> the<00:03:27.720> solution<00:03:28.380> evaporates

00:03:29.089 --> 00:03:29.099 
this on there the solution evaporates

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:33.110 
this on there the solution evaporates
but<00:03:29.340> the<00:03:29.519> rust<00:03:29.790> stays<00:03:30.389> and<00:03:30.900> it<00:03:31.799> collects<00:03:32.160> on<00:03:32.849> it

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
but the rust stays and it collects on it

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.979 
but the rust stays and it collects on it
in<00:03:33.269> a<00:03:34.069> different<00:03:35.069> pattern<00:03:35.880> it's<00:03:36.269> a<00:03:36.389> random

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:36.989 
in a different pattern it's a random

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:39.289 
in a different pattern it's a random
pattern<00:03:37.230> which<00:03:37.620> is<00:03:37.650> perfect<00:03:38.579> for<00:03:38.669> what<00:03:39.150> you're

00:03:39.289 --> 00:03:39.299 
pattern which is perfect for what you're

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:42.949 
pattern which is perfect for what you're
looking<00:03:39.569> for<00:03:39.780> that<00:03:39.989> is<00:03:40.139> rust<00:03:41.780> it'll<00:03:42.780> take

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
looking for that is rust it'll take

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:48.680 
looking for that is rust it'll take
several<00:03:43.230> times<00:03:44.930> to<00:03:46.880> get<00:03:47.880> the<00:03:48.060> rust<00:03:48.269> effect

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
several times to get the rust effect

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:50.180 
several times to get the rust effect
that<00:03:48.840> you're<00:03:48.989> wanting<00:03:49.290> you<00:03:49.410> know<00:03:49.440> you<00:03:50.040> might

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190 
that you're wanting you know you might

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:52.220 
that you're wanting you know you might
have<00:03:50.220> to<00:03:50.340> apply<00:03:50.609> five<00:03:50.940> or<00:03:51.389> six<00:03:51.630> of<00:03:51.840> them<00:03:51.959> on

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:52.230 
have to apply five or six of them on

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:55.430 
have to apply five or six of them on
there<00:03:52.530> but<00:03:53.250> when<00:03:53.430> you're<00:03:53.549> done<00:03:53.989> it<00:03:54.989> gets<00:03:55.200> a

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.440 
there but when you're done it gets a

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:59.210 
there but when you're done it gets a
random<00:03:55.880> rusted<00:03:56.880> pattern<00:03:57.299> the<00:03:58.290> next<00:03:58.680> step<00:03:58.950> that

00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.220 
random rusted pattern the next step that

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:03.920 
random rusted pattern the next step that
they<00:03:59.430> have<00:03:59.669> is<00:03:59.970> this<00:04:00.569> black<00:04:01.019> wash<00:04:01.609> and<00:04:02.660> you<00:04:03.660> use

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930 
they have is this black wash and you use

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:06.080 
they have is this black wash and you use
it<00:04:04.169> the<00:04:04.410> exact<00:04:04.739> same<00:04:04.950> way<00:04:05.190> once<00:04:05.549> you<00:04:05.730> get<00:04:05.910> it<00:04:06.060> to

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 
it the exact same way once you get it to

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:09.770 
it the exact same way once you get it to
where<00:04:06.389> you<00:04:07.250> got<00:04:08.250> the<00:04:08.519> amount<00:04:08.849> of<00:04:09.120> rust<00:04:09.480> on

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780 
where you got the amount of rust on

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:11.930 
where you got the amount of rust on
there<00:04:09.989> that<00:04:10.200> you<00:04:10.230> want<00:04:10.650> after<00:04:11.430> it<00:04:11.549> all<00:04:11.669> dries

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940 
there that you want after it all dries

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:14.150 
there that you want after it all dries
it<00:04:12.329> takes<00:04:12.569> I<00:04:12.840> don't<00:04:13.199> know<00:04:13.290> ten<00:04:13.530> minutes<00:04:13.560> for<00:04:14.069> it

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:14.160 
it takes I don't know ten minutes for it

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:15.379 
it takes I don't know ten minutes for it
to<00:04:14.190> dry<00:04:14.459> and<00:04:14.489> then<00:04:14.760> you<00:04:14.819> can<00:04:14.910> apply<00:04:15.180> another

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:15.389 
to dry and then you can apply another

00:04:15.389 --> 00:04:19.759 
to dry and then you can apply another
coat<00:04:15.750> do<00:04:16.739> it<00:04:16.889> while<00:04:17.010> you're<00:04:17.160> watching<00:04:17.190> TV<00:04:18.769> once

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:19.769 
coat do it while you're watching TV once

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:21.319 
coat do it while you're watching TV once
you<00:04:19.919> get<00:04:20.099> the<00:04:20.220> amount<00:04:20.430> of<00:04:20.579> rest<00:04:20.820> on<00:04:21.030> there<00:04:21.209> you

00:04:21.319 --> 00:04:21.329 
you get the amount of rest on there you

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:25.159 
you get the amount of rest on there you
want<00:04:21.570> you<00:04:22.440> apply<00:04:23.090> this<00:04:24.090> is<00:04:24.240> a<00:04:24.270> black<00:04:24.599> wash<00:04:24.900> this

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:25.169 
want you apply this is a black wash this

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:27.110 
want you apply this is a black wash this
really<00:04:25.530> brings<00:04:25.770> out<00:04:25.950> the<00:04:26.010> depth<00:04:26.400> of<00:04:26.729> it<00:04:26.880> and<00:04:27.030> as

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.120 
really brings out the depth of it and as

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:29.129 
really brings out the depth of it and as
you<00:04:27.330> can<00:04:27.510> see<00:04:27.570> it<00:04:27.900> really<00:04:28.200> does

00:04:29.129 --> 00:04:29.139 
you can see it really does

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:32.939 
you can see it really does
bring<00:04:29.349> out<00:04:29.469> the<00:04:29.650> depth<00:04:29.889> of<00:04:30.159> it<00:04:31.469> then<00:04:32.469> the<00:04:32.620> next

00:04:32.939 --> 00:04:32.949 
bring out the depth of it then the next

00:04:32.949 --> 00:04:35.219 
bring out the depth of it then the next
is<00:04:33.099> they<00:04:33.490> have<00:04:33.729> a<00:04:33.759> clear<00:04:34.629> coat<00:04:34.870> it's<00:04:35.139> a

00:04:35.219 --> 00:04:35.229 
is they have a clear coat it's a

00:04:35.229 --> 00:04:37.110 
is they have a clear coat it's a
four-step<00:04:35.740> process<00:04:35.949> they<00:04:36.460> have<00:04:36.550> a<00:04:36.580> clear<00:04:36.879> coat

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:37.120 
four-step process they have a clear coat

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:40.619 
four-step process they have a clear coat
and<00:04:37.389> then<00:04:37.960> there's<00:04:38.229> a<00:04:39.090> dusting<00:04:40.090> that<00:04:40.120> goes<00:04:40.449> on

00:04:40.619 --> 00:04:40.629 
and then there's a dusting that goes on

00:04:40.629 --> 00:04:44.580 
and then there's a dusting that goes on
top<00:04:42.419> honestly<00:04:43.419> I<00:04:43.449> didn't<00:04:43.840> do<00:04:43.960> step<00:04:44.229> three<00:04:44.499> and

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:44.590 
top honestly I didn't do step three and

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:47.209 
top honestly I didn't do step three and
forth<00:04:44.830> on<00:04:45.550> this<00:04:45.819> not<00:04:46.629> yet

00:04:47.209 --> 00:04:47.219 
forth on this not yet

00:04:47.219 --> 00:04:50.999 
forth on this not yet
and<00:04:48.219> it<00:04:48.430> turned<00:04:48.939> out<00:04:49.120> really<00:04:50.050> really<00:04:50.199> nice<00:04:50.650> I

00:04:50.999 --> 00:04:51.009 
and it turned out really really nice I

00:04:51.009 --> 00:04:53.159 
and it turned out really really nice I
think<00:04:51.189> and<00:04:52.180> that's<00:04:52.300> a<00:04:52.509> different<00:04:52.840> one<00:04:52.960> that<00:04:52.990> I
