this<00:00:05.670> project<00:00:05.910> the<00:00:06.540> mean<00:00:06.689> fuselage<00:00:07.140> was

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259 
this project the mean fuselage was

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:09.260 
this project the mean fuselage was
mainly<00:00:07.470> complete<00:00:07.859> so<00:00:08.580> I<00:00:08.610> decided<00:00:08.969> to<00:00:09.030> move<00:00:09.150> on

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:09.270 
mainly complete so I decided to move on

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.000 

once<00:01:20.140> I<00:01:20.260> made<00:01:20.410> sure<00:01:20.560> the<00:01:20.710> wing<00:01:20.860> was

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:21.010 
once I made sure the wing was

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:22.530 
once I made sure the wing was
perpendicular<00:01:21.580> with<00:01:21.670> the

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:22.540

the balsa and lay play structure maybe

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:27.359 
the balsa and lay play structure maybe
was<00:01:25.210> a<00:01:25.240> boxing<00:01:25.630> in<00:01:25.780> and<00:01:26.320> that<00:01:26.439> marked<00:01:26.770> drilled

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:27.369 
was a boxing in and that marked drilled

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:28.980 
was a boxing in and that marked drilled
and<00:01:27.610> added<00:01:27.909> Dallas<00:01:28.210> for<00:01:28.390> the<00:01:28.420> wing<00:01:28.810> which

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:28.990 
and added Dallas for the wing which

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:31.380 
and added Dallas for the wing which
plugs<00:01:29.350> into<00:01:29.500> the<00:01:29.590> fiberglass<00:01:30.060> front<00:01:31.060> setup

lining reference from the motor mounts I

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:43.770 
lining reference from the motor mounts I
started<00:01:42.640> building<00:01:42.759> the<00:01:43.000> firewall<00:01:43.390> and<00:01:43.600> wheel

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:43.780 
started building the firewall and wheel

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:45.600 
started building the firewall and wheel
well<00:01:43.990> I've<00:01:44.619> glued<00:01:44.799> two<00:01:45.040> balls<00:01:45.220> two<00:01:45.340> sticks<00:01:45.549> to

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:45.610 
well I've glued two balls two sticks to

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:47.190 
well I've glued two balls two sticks to
the<00:01:45.700> leading<00:01:45.939> edge<00:01:46.060> and<00:01:46.119> made<00:01:46.659> spar<00:01:46.930> and<00:01:47.020> use<00:01:47.170> a
