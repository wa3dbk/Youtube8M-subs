00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
free you know Drive night back

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.050 
free you know Drive night back
immediately<00:02:22.260> has<00:02:23.250> the<00:02:23.400> advantage<00:02:23.820> of<00:02:23.880> doing

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
immediately has the advantage of doing

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:30.080 
immediately has the advantage of doing
that<00:02:24.240> so<00:02:26.450> then<00:02:27.450> I<00:02:27.480> can<00:02:27.600> maybe<00:02:27.990> just<00:02:28.080> castle<00:02:29.090> or

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
that so then I can maybe just castle or

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:37.850 
that so then I can maybe just castle or
even<00:02:30.660> just<00:02:31.050> I<00:02:31.230> don't<00:02:31.320> know<00:02:31.440> f4<00:02:34.520> f4<00:02:35.520> here<00:02:36.860> gives

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
even just I don't know f4 f4 here gives

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.850 
even just I don't know f4 f4 here gives
gives<00:02:38.070> f5<00:02:38.550> for<00:02:38.910> the<00:02:39.330> night

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
gives f5 for the night

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.120 
gives f5 for the night
so<00:02:41.670> if<00:02:41.760> III<00:02:42.300> I<00:02:42.330> can<00:02:42.630> castle<00:02:43.080> EF<00:02:43.410> Knight<00:02:43.680> f5

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
so if III I can castle EF Knight f5

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:47.710 
so if III I can castle EF Knight f5
attacking<00:02:44.910> d4<00:02:45.420> I<00:02:45.630> mean<00:02:46.350> this<00:02:46.440> could<00:02:46.709> be<00:02:46.740> a<00:02:46.860> nice

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
attacking d4 I mean this could be a nice

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.410 
attacking d4 I mean this could be a nice
positional<00:02:48.720> crush<00:02:49.080> I<00:02:49.350> can<00:02:49.790> because<00:02:50.790> I'm<00:02:51.150> also

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
positional crush I can because I'm also

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:52.610 
positional crush I can because I'm also
attacking<00:02:51.690> this<00:02:51.930> rook<00:02:52.140> or<00:02:52.230> Knight<00:02:52.290> each<00:02:52.440> race

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
attacking this rook or Knight each race

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.820 
attacking this rook or Knight each race
I've<00:02:52.770> gained<00:02:52.980> another<00:02:53.190> tempo<00:02:53.640> that's<00:02:54.360> bonus

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:54.830 
I've gained another tempo that's bonus

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:57.320 
I've gained another tempo that's bonus
so<00:02:55.830> when<00:02:55.980> you<00:02:56.070> just<00:02:56.250> castle<00:02:56.790> this<00:02:56.970> bishops

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.330 
so when you just castle this bishops

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:00.530 
so when you just castle this bishops
also<00:02:57.690> a<00:02:57.720> bit<00:02:58.050> bad<00:02:58.880> can<00:02:59.880> I<00:02:59.910> do<00:03:00.060> better<00:03:00.240> maybe

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
also a bit bad can I do better maybe

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.420

on<00:03:33.300> f5<00:03:33.690> I<00:03:34.050> think<00:03:34.380> so<00:03:36.680> because<00:03:37.680> if<00:03:37.950> the<00:03:38.040> light

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
on f5 I think so because if the light

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:39.830 
on f5 I think so because if the light
comes<00:03:38.430> back<00:03:38.519> to<00:03:38.760> a5<00:03:39.030> you<00:03:39.269> know<00:03:39.360> it<00:03:39.420> wants<00:03:39.630> to<00:03:39.720> go

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
comes back to a5 you know it wants to go

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:46.070 
comes back to a5 you know it wants to go
there<00:03:40.050> anyway<00:03:44.390> so<00:03:45.390> what<00:03:45.510> do<00:03:45.570> I<00:03:45.660> need<00:03:45.720> to<00:03:45.930> be

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:46.080 
there anyway so what do I need to be

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:49.550 
there anyway so what do I need to be
concerned<00:03:46.530> about<00:03:46.650> here<00:03:47.540> okay<00:03:48.540> here<00:03:48.930> I<00:03:49.200> think

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
concerned about here okay here I think

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.250 
concerned about here okay here I think
might<00:03:49.800> be<00:03:49.950> four<00:03:50.300> looks<00:03:51.300> pretty<00:03:51.570> pretty<00:03:52.050> nice

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
might be four looks pretty pretty nice

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.050 
might be four looks pretty pretty nice
can't<00:03:53.220> see<00:03:53.340> anything<00:03:53.489> stronger<00:03:53.880> at<00:03:54.000> the

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
can't see anything stronger at the

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:58.790 
can't see anything stronger at the
moment<00:03:57.170> well<00:03:58.170> that<00:03:58.290> I<00:03:58.320> don't<00:03:58.530> know<00:03:58.590> actually

00:03:58.790 --> 00:03:58.800 
moment well that I don't know actually

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:02.420 
moment well that I don't know actually
95<00:03:59.600> it's<00:04:00.600> more<00:04:00.780> central<00:04:01.290> because<00:04:01.950> like<00:04:02.130> before

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
95 it's more central because like before

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:07.090 
95 it's more central because like before
it<00:04:02.549> could<00:04:02.640> be<00:04:02.760> chased<00:04:03.060> later

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:07.100

00:05:56.129 --> 00:05:56.139 

00:05:56.139 --> 00:05:57.899 

as<00:05:56.560> good<00:05:56.740> as<00:05:56.830> bishop<00:05:57.159> spenders<00:05:57.580> well<00:05:57.729> actually

00:05:57.899 --> 00:05:57.909 
as good as bishop spenders well actually

00:05:57.909 --> 00:06:03.809 
as good as bishop spenders well actually

00:07:59.730 --> 00:07:59.740 
the exchange just probably chat was

00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:02.010 
the exchange just probably chat was
harmless<00:08:00.099> it<00:08:00.610> actually<00:08:01.180> puts<00:08:01.419> the<00:08:01.569> Queen<00:08:01.839> on<00:08:01.990> a
