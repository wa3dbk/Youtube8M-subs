00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:13.300
 hello all how about 

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:14.800
 well I made a topic here with 

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:16.620
 you then share this makeup 

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:18.510
 you are watching 

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:20.940
 finally it is the first makeup that 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:24.450
 I do in 2015 if it is a proposal a 

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:26.130
 I sing sweet and it's good but in the end 

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:27.330
 As always, I ended up moving and 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.050
 said a moment about what I 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.330
 wanted to 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.000
 in short I hope you like makeup 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.350
 I told you to watch the video as always 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.829
 begins by applying a test for 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.829
 eyelids 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.309
 to give more depth to the look 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:45.500
 I'm going to start applying the same 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:48.280
 chocolate for everything the end of 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.280
 end of the eye 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.020
 and also make a base color more 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.369
 clear what places the eyelid mobile 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.100
 so that the shadow that I'm going to put 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:29.719
 over it will be a little more intense in this 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.719
 case the effect with a white suck 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:34.360
 I have what it is one thing would be to move to 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:36.280
 blur with him 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:38.200
 synthetic 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:40.740
 It may seem very intense to have an area 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.740
 as nothing 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:49.500
 to apply a chocolate shade that 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:49.500
 especially going to go here where it applies 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:13.830
 ah 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:18.099
 ah 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:29.470
 once I have something like that you can see everything 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:31.720
 what the brown applied what the 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:33.220
 right end of the eye and also the 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.750
 basin I make blurred of moving to 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:36.790
 apply the starting shadow of this 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:38.879
 makeup 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:38.879
 to 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:42.890
 and as I get closer to 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.780
 Brown 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:46.850
 very well blurring what is little to 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:49.270
 little I always apply what is the 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:53.160
 strongest amount the center 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:53.160
 the rest blurring 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.930
 I will move to apply once what 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:04.010
 closed by all sheets of eyelashes 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:04.010
 interior of the eye line 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:31.410
 I'm going to apply the base 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:34.740
 makeup and for ibeas to the rostrum 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:36.360
 delorean in the tone w 4 to apply the 

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:38.990
 makeup base had to use the 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.990
 living place 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:45.209
 once applied the foundation 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:46.980
 I'm going to move on to do some small 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:49.520
 corrections and some redness that I have 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:49.520
 in the face 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:57.970
 besides now machine to use this 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:57.970
 pencil 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:07.060
 I will move on to fix what is the basis of 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:08.680
 makeup and the corrections that I've 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:10.659
 done and to do this using these powders 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:13.960
 loose of chanel with a hair brush 

00:04:10.659 --> 00:04:16.900
 loose I apply it and the area 

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:18.610
 the wrongs I will pass it 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:21.810
 stay in a very subtle way 

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:21.810
 face helping me out of this one 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:32.310
 to review what the concealer applies 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:32.310
 I'm going to use the prologue of amac 

00:04:44.569 --> 00:04:48.080
 when I have applied the corrector I will 

00:04:46.339 --> 00:04:50.230
 pass what blurs the next 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:53.100
 lower eye 

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:53.100
 with a colloquial tone 

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:00.870
 and to illuminate a little what is the 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:04.370
 trench arch I'll use the shadows 

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:04.370
 antich white from nothing 

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:10.150
 I'm going to spend what it is to apply the 

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:13.410
 blusher and in this case I salt the tone 

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:13.410
 Luminous of Milan 

00:05:15.009 --> 00:05:20.759
 to finalize what the trail of a 

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:20.759
 small lookout and goddess 

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:26.949
 I did not train with face and eyes 

00:05:24.759 --> 00:05:27.939
 it has happened to me in life a very 

00:05:26.949 --> 00:05:29.050
 subtle 

00:05:27.939 --> 00:05:32.110
 Of course this is a matter of taste 

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:33.430
 but in this case I would like to opt for 

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:35.889
 very natural lips and very 

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:38.530
 wearable apart I also need to search 

00:05:35.889 --> 00:05:41.139
 an excuse to release this lipstick 

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:42.789
 new clarion 

00:05:41.139 --> 00:05:45.960
 I love it because it still maintains the 

00:05:42.789 --> 00:05:47.759
 same aroma and smell as he 

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:49.500
 and that the format as long as the 

00:05:47.759 --> 00:05:51.000
 blues format give a little touch of 

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:53.210
 profiler to give you a little more 

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.210
 return 

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:04.530
 well this result the makeup 

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:07.120
 I hope you liked the truth that 

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:08.770
 I was thinking of doing something a little more subtle more 

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:10.419
 llevable but in the end as always me 

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:12.039
 I was thrilled a little and I did it a little 

00:06:10.419 --> 00:06:13.960
 more intense than I wanted as 

00:06:12.039 --> 00:06:16.030
