00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:18.089
 I already expected a lot since I went to 

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:27.909

00:00:18.089 --> 00:00:31.649
 they just told me they did not tell me 

00:00:27.909 --> 00:00:34.210

00:00:31.649 --> 00:00:37.660

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:39.610
 if you like the video the video or how 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:42.940

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:47.079
 many meanings because they can give you 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:49.390
 like and if they want me to upload a gameplay 

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:52.980
 although I do not have a captor but I have 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:52.980
 a beautiful device that can record well 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:58.930
 but I can not record with him and so 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:04.000
 what does it make me laugh do not worry 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:06.580
 that's why they want to put a video if I think 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.549

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:13.650

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.880
 a hand grasped 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:18.880
 once 

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:38.720
 if I my new way of opening calculations 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:41.200
 things is with a compass exactly 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.200
 a point 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:51.360
 my hands are sweaty because I just 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:53.650

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.640

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:56.640

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:10.420

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:10.420
 224 cooperatives 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:18.239
 bring me hear 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:21.000
 It was cheap to start this 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:23.770
 game I thought I was going to go out 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:28.530
 100 800 or 300 pesos 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:28.530
 but it turns out that I did not go to the store 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:36.180
 499 and I said I buy it 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:54.340

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:03.400
 lined up they saw some codes but I do not know 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:03.400
 worry do not worry 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:17.720
 where they will not do anything 

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:20.330
 because by the way they gave me some dlc 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:21.920
 like let's say I bought it apart from 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:26.750

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:36.860
