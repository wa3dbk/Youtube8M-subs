00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:02.040 
hey guys this is hockey gross 35 here

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.380 
hey guys this is hockey gross 35 here
but<00:00:02.669> um<00:00:02.909> how<00:00:03.870> do<00:00:03.929> you<00:00:04.020> build<00:00:04.290> a<00:00:04.680> UAV<00:00:05.100> this<00:00:06.060> is<00:00:06.180> my

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:06.390 
but um how do you build a UAV this is my

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:14.530 
but um how do you build a UAV this is my
custom<00:00:06.930> UAV<00:00:09.740> Stan<00:00:10.740> a<00:00:11.099> UAV<00:00:11.910> is<00:00:12.179> a<00:00:13.370> unmanned

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:14.540 
custom UAV Stan a UAV is a unmanned

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:17.680 
custom UAV Stan a UAV is a unmanned
aircraft<00:00:15.540> basically<00:00:16.289> like<00:00:16.710> our<00:00:16.859> seaplane<00:00:17.250> um

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:17.690 
aircraft basically like our seaplane um

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:20.029 
aircraft basically like our seaplane um
so<00:00:18.690> I'm<00:00:18.810> gonna<00:00:18.930> be<00:00:19.170> breaking<00:00:19.410> this<00:00:19.650> up<00:00:19.859> into

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
so I'm gonna be breaking this up into

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:26.240 
so I'm gonna be breaking this up into
one<00:00:20.689> two<00:00:21.689> three<00:00:22.529> four<00:00:23.189> five<00:00:23.699> and<00:00:24.119> then<00:00:24.439> six<00:00:25.439> and

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
one two three four five and then six and

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.429 
one two three four five and then six and
seven<00:00:27.170> counting<00:00:28.170> landing<00:00:28.590> gear<00:00:30.080> things<00:00:31.080> I'm

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
seven counting landing gear things I'm

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.630 
seven counting landing gear things I'm
probably<00:00:31.890> done<00:00:32.099> to<00:00:32.189> make<00:00:32.430> this<00:00:32.610> two<00:00:32.820> parts<00:00:34.640> so

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
probably done to make this two parts so

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:41.060 
probably done to make this two parts so
let's<00:00:36.480> start<00:00:36.840> out<00:00:36.960> with<00:00:37.430> the<00:00:38.450> top<00:00:39.450> of<00:00:39.690> it<00:00:40.070> so

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
let's start out with the top of it so

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.170 
let's start out with the top of it so
the<00:00:41.190> top<00:00:41.399> is<00:00:41.760> pretty<00:00:42.719> simple<00:00:43.710> and<00:00:44.010> they're<00:00:45.000> all

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
the top is pretty simple and they're all

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.979 
the top is pretty simple and they're all
this<00:00:45.360> stuff<00:00:45.660> away<00:00:47.690> now

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:50.989 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:58.220 

now<00:00:51.989> to<00:00:52.110> make<00:00:52.320> this<00:00:52.530> you<00:00:52.920> need<00:00:56.329> these<00:00:57.329> smooth

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
now to make this you need these smooth

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:07.719 
now to make this you need these smooth
pieces<00:00:59.570> for<00:01:00.570> and<00:01:01.050> I<00:01:01.289> think<00:01:01.559> this<00:01:01.710> is<00:01:01.920> six<00:01:03.619> then

00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:07.729 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:16.730 

a<00:01:11.869> two<00:01:12.869> by<00:01:13.020> one<00:01:13.049> and<00:01:13.670> you<00:01:15.350> need<00:01:16.350> your<00:01:16.500> actually

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
a two by one and you need your actually

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.660 
a two by one and you need your actually
two<00:01:16.950> these<00:01:19.040> so<00:01:20.040> to<00:01:20.460> start<00:01:20.700> out<00:01:20.820> you<00:01:20.970> need<00:01:21.150> that

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:22.670 
two these so to start out you need that

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.570 
two these so to start out you need that
and<00:01:23.670> then<00:01:23.700> you<00:01:24.210> place<00:01:24.689> this<00:01:25.409> on<00:01:25.710> top<00:01:26.070> of<00:01:26.369> here

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
and then you place this on top of here

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:32.359 
and then you place this on top of here
like<00:01:27.119> that<00:01:28.159> both<00:01:29.159> sides<00:01:30.920> this<00:01:31.920> is<00:01:31.979> really

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
like that both sides this is really

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.520 
like that both sides this is really
simple<00:01:32.670> on

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:36.530 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:38.800 

it<00:01:36.979> took<00:01:37.100> me<00:01:37.280> a<00:01:37.340> long<00:01:37.460> time<00:01:37.520> though<00:01:37.940> it's

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:38.810 
it took me a long time though it's

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:44.200 
it took me a long time though it's
actually<00:01:38.960> figure<00:01:39.470> it<00:01:39.590> out<00:01:39.909> and<00:01:40.909> then<00:01:43.180> then<00:01:44.180> you

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.210 
actually figure it out and then then you

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:49.810 
actually figure it out and then then you
put<00:01:44.510> a<00:01:45.430> 3x2<00:01:46.540> like<00:01:47.540> this<00:01:47.840> and<00:01:48.140> then<00:01:48.710> a<00:01:48.830> 2x2<00:01:49.310> and

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:49.820 
put a 3x2 like this and then a 2x2 and

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:53.710 
put a 3x2 like this and then a 2x2 and
then<00:01:50.299> a<00:01:51.040> two<00:01:52.040> by<00:01:52.190> one<00:01:52.220> right<00:01:52.909> there<00:01:53.119> so<00:01:53.630> it

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:53.720 
then a two by one right there so it

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:58.170 
then a two by one right there so it
makes<00:01:53.899> that<00:01:54.050> slanted<00:01:55.040> effect<00:01:55.399> then<00:01:56.360> you<00:01:56.390> place

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:58.180 
makes that slanted effect then you place

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:05.370 
makes that slanted effect then you place
this<00:01:59.200> 1<00:02:00.200> by<00:02:00.380> 6<00:02:00.740> flat<00:02:01.700> and<00:02:02.180> the<00:02:02.979> tuba<00:02:03.979> are<00:02:04.159> 1<00:02:04.700> by<00:02:04.850> 4

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380 
this 1 by 6 flat and the tuba are 1 by 4

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.719 
this 1 by 6 flat and the tuba are 1 by 4
so<00:02:06.380> that's<00:02:06.530> how<00:02:06.740> you<00:02:06.799> make<00:02:07.009> the<00:02:07.549> head<00:02:07.790> of<00:02:08.030> the

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:09.729 
so that's how you make the head of the

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:13.720 
so that's how you make the head of the
the<00:02:10.729> UAV<00:02:11.830> so<00:02:12.830> I'm<00:02:12.890> gonna<00:02:13.070> put<00:02:13.220> that<00:02:13.340> off<00:02:13.519> to<00:02:13.550> the

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
the UAV so I'm gonna put that off to the

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:20.710 
the UAV so I'm gonna put that off to the
side<00:02:14.060> I'm<00:02:16.570> alright<00:02:17.739> now<00:02:18.739> the<00:02:18.800> wings<00:02:19.540> the<00:02:20.540> wings

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
side I'm alright now the wings the wings

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:28.750 
side I'm alright now the wings the wings
are<00:02:21.590> a<00:02:21.650> little<00:02:21.860> bit<00:02:22.069> tricky<00:02:22.459> for<00:02:22.489> me<00:02:24.700> so<00:02:27.760> so

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
are a little bit tricky for me so so

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:33.490 
are a little bit tricky for me so so
this<00:02:28.940> you<00:02:29.630> need<00:02:29.840> a<00:02:30.050> it<00:02:30.950> looks<00:02:31.190> like<00:02:31.250> an<00:02:31.459> 8<00:02:32.500> 8

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
this you need a it looks like an 8 8

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:42.130 
this you need a it looks like an 8 8
pieces<00:02:33.890> 1<00:02:34.850> by<00:02:35.000> 8<00:02:35.239> and<00:02:35.540> then<00:02:36.040> a<00:02:38.709> 1<00:02:39.709> by<00:02:40.040> 2<00:02:41.079> this<00:02:42.079> is

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
pieces 1 by 8 and then a 1 by 2 this is

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:50.199 
pieces 1 by 8 and then a 1 by 2 this is
so<00:02:43.600> it<00:02:44.600> fits<00:02:45.320> on<00:02:47.079> and<00:02:48.370> then<00:02:49.370> you<00:02:49.820> just<00:02:49.850> need<00:02:50.150> a

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:50.209 
so it fits on and then you just need a

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:55.360 
so it fits on and then you just need a
regular<00:02:50.930> wing<00:02:51.590> piece<00:02:52.010> and<00:02:52.720> a<00:02:54.310> this<00:02:55.310> is

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
regular wing piece and a this is

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:58.180 
regular wing piece and a this is
optional<00:02:55.970> right<00:02:56.030> here<00:02:56.420> the<00:02:57.140> 1<00:02:57.320> by<00:02:57.470> 4<00:02:57.739> it's

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.190 
optional right here the 1 by 4 it's

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:04.180 
optional right here the 1 by 4 it's
optional<00:02:58.730> umm<00:03:00.220> you<00:03:01.220> place<00:03:01.489> that<00:03:02.680> right<00:03:03.680> there

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:04.190 
optional umm you place that right there

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:07.900 
optional umm you place that right there
and<00:03:04.670> you<00:03:05.540> do<00:03:05.720> the<00:03:05.930> exact<00:03:06.380> same<00:03:06.530> thing<00:03:07.040> on<00:03:07.340> the

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:07.910 
and you do the exact same thing on the

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:11.289 
and you do the exact same thing on the

00:03:11.289 --> 00:03:11.299 
other side now you grab the head of the

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:17.050 
other side now you grab the head of the
plane<00:03:11.709> and<00:03:12.709> you<00:03:12.950> place<00:03:13.340> it<00:03:13.660> right<00:03:14.660> here<00:03:16.060> but

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060 
plane and you place it right here but

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:18.400 
plane and you place it right here but
I'm<00:03:17.390> not<00:03:17.570> going<00:03:17.810> to<00:03:17.840> do<00:03:17.959> that
