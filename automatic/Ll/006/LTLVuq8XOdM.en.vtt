strength again one of the biggest things
we<00:00:30.330> try<00:00:30.599> to<00:00:30.660> coach<00:00:30.960> when<00:00:31.170> people<00:00:31.560> is<00:00:32.009> to<00:00:32.430> get

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
we try to coach when people is to get

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.420 
we try to coach when people is to get
parallel<00:00:33.600> to<00:00:33.630> the<00:00:34.020> ground<00:00:34.260> landing<00:00:34.980> you<00:00:35.399> know

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
parallel to the ground landing you know

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.910 
parallel to the ground landing you know
so<00:00:35.730> if<00:00:35.820> you<00:00:35.910> see<00:00:36.120> my<00:00:36.329> foot<00:00:36.690> I<00:00:36.989> want<00:00:37.500> to<00:00:37.590> try<00:00:37.860> to

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
hitting and the heel settling there's a

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.579 
hitting and the heel settling there's a
little<00:01:02.730> more<00:01:02.910> power<00:01:03.180> more<00:01:03.570> propulsion<00:01:03.960> coming

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
little more power more propulsion coming

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.560 
little more power more propulsion coming
out<00:01:04.710> of<00:01:04.799> there<00:01:04.949> but<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:05.549> thing<00:01:05.790> that<00:01:05.850> happens

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
out of there but the thing that happens

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.070 
out of there but the thing that happens
if<00:01:06.750> if<00:01:07.380> you<00:01:07.619> override<00:01:08.369> that<00:01:08.729> parallel<00:01:09.630> landing

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
if if you override that parallel landing

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.530 
if if you override that parallel landing
or<00:01:10.380> parallel<00:01:11.310> to<00:01:11.369> the<00:01:11.790> ball<00:01:12.000> of<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.330> foot

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
or parallel to the ball of the foot

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.219 
or parallel to the ball of the foot
landing<00:01:13.110> which<00:01:13.650> is<00:01:13.860> here<00:01:14.430> here<00:01:15.299> and<00:01:15.479> then<00:01:15.930> lift

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
landing which is here here and then lift

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.929 
landing which is here here and then lift
if<00:01:16.530> you<00:01:16.860> override<00:01:17.640> that<00:01:17.970> and<00:01:18.210> you<00:01:18.840> toe<00:01:19.170> down

00:01:19.929 --> 00:01:19.939 
if you override that and you toe down

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:22.880 
if you override that and you toe down
again<00:01:20.939> you're<00:01:21.330> suspended<00:01:22.049> on<00:01:22.170> your<00:01:22.350> cap<00:01:22.619> at

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
again you're suspended on your cap at

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.249 
again you're suspended on your cap at
that<00:01:23.100> moment<00:01:23.369> try<00:01:24.299> that<00:01:24.570> if<00:01:24.780> you<00:01:24.810> point<00:01:25.110> your

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
that moment try that if you point your

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:26.870 
that moment try that if you point your
toe<00:01:25.470> down<00:01:25.740> to<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:26.040> ground<00:01:26.280> right<00:01:26.490> now<00:01:26.670> you'll

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
toe down to the ground right now you'll

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.030 
toe down to the ground right now you'll
notice<00:01:27.119> your<00:01:27.270> calf<00:01:27.479> really<00:01:27.840> tightens<00:01:28.259> up<00:01:28.409> so

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
notice your calf really tightens up so

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.700 
notice your calf really tightens up so
if<00:01:29.189> I'm<00:01:29.340> suspended<00:01:30.060> on<00:01:30.180> my<00:01:30.329> calf<00:01:30.600> and<00:01:30.930> then<00:01:31.650> I

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
if I'm suspended on my calf and then I

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.249 
if I'm suspended on my calf and then I
lose<00:01:32.070> time<00:01:32.430> here<00:01:32.820> with<00:01:33.000> my<00:01:33.150> body<00:01:33.390> with<00:01:33.720> my<00:01:34.020> foot

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
lose time here with my body with my foot

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.770 
lose time here with my body with my foot
me<00:01:34.380> in<00:01:34.500> front<00:01:34.740> of<00:01:34.829> my<00:01:34.979> body<00:01:35.189> I'm<00:01:35.579> suspended<00:01:36.570> now

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
me in front of my body I'm suspended now

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.620 
me in front of my body I'm suspended now
I<00:01:36.810> pushed<00:01:37.259> off<00:01:37.470> again<00:01:37.920> I'm<00:01:38.520> relying<00:01:39.150> it's

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
I pushed off again I'm relying it's

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.719 
I pushed off again I'm relying it's
really<00:01:40.079> pretty<00:01:40.229> much<00:01:40.439> like<00:01:40.680> the<00:01:40.860> sprinting

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
really pretty much like the sprinting

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.399 
really pretty much like the sprinting
gait<00:01:41.970> and<00:01:42.210> I'm<00:01:42.299> relying<00:01:42.780> it<00:01:42.960> on<00:01:43.079> being

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
gait and I'm relying it on being

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.010 
gait and I'm relying it on being
suspended<00:01:44.280> on<00:01:44.700> these<00:01:44.939> propulsive<00:01:45.659> muscles

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
suspended on these propulsive muscles

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.080 
suspended on these propulsive muscles
and<00:01:46.170> then<00:01:46.530> power<00:01:46.829> it<00:01:47.040> off<00:01:47.189> on<00:01:47.430> these<00:01:47.579> puzzels

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
and then power it off on these puzzels

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.270 
and then power it off on these puzzels
propulsive<00:01:48.630> muscles<00:01:48.990> so<00:01:49.470> again

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
propulsive muscles so again

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.859 
propulsive muscles so again
calf<00:01:50.579> and<00:01:50.790> Achilles<00:01:51.119> just<00:01:51.600> like<00:01:51.750> the

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
calf and Achilles just like the

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.870 
calf and Achilles just like the
hamstring<00:01:52.380> everything<00:01:53.040> in<00:01:53.130> the<00:01:53.220> back<00:01:53.399> leg<00:01:53.850> is

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
hamstring everything in the back leg is

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.819 
hamstring everything in the back leg is
for<00:01:54.210> pushing<00:01:54.689> and<00:01:54.869> we<00:01:55.439> use<00:01:55.649> that

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
for pushing and we use that

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:58.310 
for pushing and we use that
predominantly<00:01:56.130> for<00:01:56.640> sprinting<00:01:57.240> so<00:01:57.840> remember

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
predominantly for sprinting so remember

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.810 
predominantly for sprinting so remember
you're<00:01:58.439> running<00:01:58.740> long<00:01:58.890> distance<00:01:59.369> and<00:01:59.460> even<00:01:59.610> if

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
you're running long distance and even if
