00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.780
 when something 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.230
 just a couple of hours ago we launched 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.299
 the news video of the week and here 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.770
 we are again but as you can see the 

00:00:12.299 --> 00:00:18.470
 Videogame news does not stop 

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:18.470
 roll of washing surprises and minecraft 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.810
 we have been talking about this issue throughout 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.060
 from the last days until now it was a 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.520
 rumor but the word rumor disappears 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.829
 of our language and it is already official 

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:33.780
 microsoft has bought wet and so 

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:37.830
 both have the rights of minecraft 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:40.559
 now wet they become part of 

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:42.750
 an internal study of microsoft like 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:46.470
 It can be 343 industries as it can be 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:48.870
 lionhead studios and mojan happens to be and 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:52.230
 minecraft forgiveness happens to be a license 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.949
 from microsoft itself the ad has 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.500
 dice 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:58.079
 phil spencer responsible for xbox a 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.329
 via xbox uruguay and here comments 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:03.719
 that the close collaboration relationship 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:05.460
 Between Nun and Marc and Microsoft started 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:07.470
 with the release of the version of 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.820
 minecraft for xbox 360 if you do 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.460
 memory for a very long time 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.860
 minecraft consoles was an exclusive of 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.539
 xbox 360 and it was quite a while after 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.429
 when he started to get to the different 

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:20.690
 platforms like playstation or 

00:01:17.429 --> 00:01:23.890
 subsequently play station 4 also 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:26.350
 bringing great successes 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:28.120
 now the question of the million already 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:29.860
 full response what will happen to the 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:31.780
 version of playstation 3 what will happen 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:34.330
 with the playstation 4 version and not 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:36.010
 just that but also microsoft is 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:37.479
 owner of 'windows phone' so 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:39.100
 So what will happen to the version of 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:41.619
 years and what will happen with the version of 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.430
 android it will not happen absolutely 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:44.650
 nothing 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:46.659
 phil spencer says in his statement 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:49.060
 that Microsoft has the firm intention 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:51.460
 to nurture the minecraft community by 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:53.229
 so they will continue to market the 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:55.090
 video game on platforms 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:57.369
 playstation as in android as in years 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:00.100
 so great news this is the one 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:01.990
 they are coming first for the 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:04.960
 users of minecraft through the 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:07.330
 different platforms a priori there is no 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.830
 clear changes a priori because of course 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:10.840
 there have to be some kind of changes 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:12.850
 We'll see what happens throughout the 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.430
 next months we will see the movements 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:18.070
 but at least for now things 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:20.019
 they stay as they are saying 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:23.140
 also that the main with announced for 

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:24.459
 2015 london is still going on so the 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:26.739
 that are out there close and they want 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:29.200
 approach have a scheduled meeting 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:30.220
 among minecraft fans to know 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.650
 all the news 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:35.770
 the video game and very important in the end 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:37.540
 of the post dedicates a few words to a blog 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:39.430
 itself I say a few words in youtubers 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.080
 and also to the people of tweets I would say 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:42.910
 that by extension this is news 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:45.430
 very important because in minecraft it is 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:48.070
 one of the games that more movement 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:50.340
 has in the video networks and in the 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:53.110
 information portals so 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:55.060
 microsoft will continue to support the 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:58.570
 creators of content or that we can 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:00.730
 deduce about through this first 

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:02.980
 statement in which phil spencer 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:05.320
 announces this transaction does not speak of 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:07.390
 numbers logically but reuters that was 

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:08.800
 who raised the hare yesterday 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:10.660
 saying tomorrow is going to be the day of 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:13.420
 ad like this is 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:15.010
 suggests that over two billion 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.500
 dollars that was what we shuffled the 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:21.520
 last week the figure would be close to 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:23.920
 the 2.5 billion dollars there is 

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:25.510
 nothing there is that one of the great 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:27.970
 news within the world of videogame 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:30.850
 over the last few days we see that 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:33.100
 microsoft has the portfolio nurtured and 

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:36.010
 bet on the world of the video game what 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:38.019
 that in the end is a very large 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:40.030
 subscribe to the youtube channel from a 

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:41.890
 network for this and other news as you see 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:43.900
 here at the moment in the youtube channel 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:46.209
 of the network area and, of course, with the network 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:48.450
 puntocom to say goodbye this month 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:48.450

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:55.660
 when I
