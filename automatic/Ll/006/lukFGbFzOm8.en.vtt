00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:34.300 
I guess so I'm gonna do prestige where
everything<00:03:32.480> is<00:03:32.570> included<00:03:33.110> and<00:03:33.829> this<00:03:34.040> is<00:03:34.130> what

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:34.310

your options she kind of looks like the
same<00:03:36.590> color<00:03:36.829> palette<00:03:37.120> so<00:03:38.120> we<00:03:38.269> would<00:03:38.450> do<00:03:38.630> mythos

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:39.079 
same color palette so we would do mythos

00:03:39.079 --> 00:03:43.810 
same color palette so we would do mythos
block<00:03:39.380> again<00:03:40.510> we<00:03:41.510> go<00:03:41.630> down<00:03:41.780> to<00:03:41.900> magma<00:03:42.260> red<00:03:42.820> and

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:43.820 
block again we go down to magma red and

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:45.670 
block again we go down to magma red and
we<00:03:44.420> would<00:03:44.570> do<00:03:44.660> the<00:03:44.750> advanced<00:03:45.049> technology

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:45.680 
we would do the advanced technology

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.340 
we would do the advanced technology
package<00:03:46.040> so<00:03:46.130> this<00:03:46.250> gives<00:03:46.400> you<00:03:46.489> adapted<00:03:46.940> cruise

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:47.350 
package so this gives you adapted cruise

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:49.780 
package so this gives you adapted cruise

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:51.109 
right which is that collision warning

00:03:51.109 --> 00:03:54.190 
right which is that collision warning
and<00:03:51.260> partial<00:03:51.620> emergency<00:03:52.040> braking<00:03:53.019> yeah<00:03:54.019> this

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:54.200 
and partial emergency braking yeah this

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:56.020 
and partial emergency braking yeah this
is<00:03:54.290> what<00:03:54.410> we<00:03:54.530> end<00:03:54.650> up<00:03:54.739> with<00:03:54.799> the<00:03:55.489> base<00:03:55.670> wheels

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:56.030 
is what we end up with the base wheels

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:58.210 
is what we end up with the base wheels
and<00:03:56.180> you<00:03:56.239> can<00:03:56.359> tell<00:03:56.540> it's<00:03:56.780> a<00:03:56.959> got<00:03:57.859> the<00:03:57.950> advanced
