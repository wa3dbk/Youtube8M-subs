00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
250 Yamaha on our test boat we're about

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.279 
250 Yamaha on our test boat we're about
to<00:00:13.530> do<00:00:13.620> a<00:00:13.650> compression<00:00:14.070> check<00:00:14.429> on<00:00:14.700> it

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
to do a compression check on it

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:18.259 
to do a compression check on it
this<00:00:16.859> is<00:00:17.009> the<00:00:17.160> engine<00:00:17.519> right<00:00:17.640> here<00:00:17.999> it's<00:00:18.150> in

00:00:18.259 --> 00:00:18.269 
this is the engine right here it's in

00:00:18.269 --> 00:00:22.009 
this is the engine right here it's in
good<00:00:18.900> condition<00:00:20.419> we<00:00:21.419> did<00:00:21.599> put<00:00:21.779> a<00:00:21.810> little

00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:22.019 
good condition we did put a little

00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:24.620 
good condition we did put a little
touch-up<00:00:22.230> paint<00:00:22.649> on<00:00:22.859> it<00:00:23.179> the<00:00:24.179> lower<00:00:24.359> unit

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
touch-up paint on it the lower unit

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.450 
touch-up paint on it the lower unit
appears<00:00:25.050> to<00:00:25.199> have<00:00:25.349> been<00:00:25.619> replaced<00:00:25.800> I<00:00:26.279> just

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
appears to have been replaced I just

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.999 
appears to have been replaced I just
checked<00:00:26.699> the<00:00:26.820> water<00:00:27.029> pump<00:00:27.329> on<00:00:27.509> it<00:00:27.689> and<00:00:28.009> it's

00:00:28.999 --> 00:00:29.009 
checked the water pump on it and it's

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:31.130 
checked the water pump on it and it's
there's<00:00:29.609> no<00:00:29.849> corrosion<00:00:30.239> on<00:00:30.539> the<00:00:30.599> top<00:00:30.839> section

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
there's no corrosion on the top section

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.049 
there's no corrosion on the top section
of<00:00:31.379> the<00:00:31.439> lower<00:00:31.589> unit<00:00:31.859> so<00:00:32.160> it<00:00:32.309> looks<00:00:32.519> to<00:00:32.669> be<00:00:32.699> a

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
of the lower unit so it looks to be a

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.360 
of the lower unit so it looks to be a
lot<00:00:33.329> newer<00:00:33.600> than<00:00:33.750> the<00:00:33.930> engine<00:00:34.350> water<00:00:35.100> pump

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
lot newer than the engine water pump

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.660 
lot newer than the engine water pump
checked<00:00:35.610> out<00:00:35.820> great<00:00:37.220> we're<00:00:38.220> going<00:00:38.339> to<00:00:38.399> proceed

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670

pound<00:02:10.410> of<00:02:10.560> to<00:02:10.710> a<00:02:10.740> 150<00:02:11.370> on<00:02:11.490> all<00:02:11.640> six<00:02:11.970> cylinders

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
pound of to a 150 on all six cylinders

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.640 
pound of to a 150 on all six cylinders
okay<00:02:14.580> the<00:02:14.730> spark<00:02:15.090> plugs<00:02:15.420> would<00:02:16.080> change<00:02:16.350> that

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
okay the spark plugs would change that

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.040 
okay the spark plugs would change that
the<00:02:16.770> 200<00:02:17.340> our<00:02:17.640> service<00:02:18.360> that<00:02:18.540> was<00:02:18.660> just<00:02:18.870> done

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
the 200 our service that was just done

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:20.960 
the 200 our service that was just done
on<00:02:19.320> it<00:02:19.440> so<00:02:19.620> they<00:02:19.740> look<00:02:19.950> brand<00:02:20.250> new<00:02:20.400> the

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
on it so they look brand new the

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:22.700 
on it so they look brand new the
electrode<00:02:21.480> the<00:02:21.630> wear<00:02:21.840> bars<00:02:22.080> and<00:02:22.380> everything

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:22.710 
electrode the wear bars and everything

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:24.920 
electrode the wear bars and everything
is<00:02:22.800> still<00:02:22.980> good<00:02:23.160> on<00:02:23.190> the<00:02:23.370> electrodes<00:02:23.880> going<00:02:24.870> to

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
is still good on the electrodes going to

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.840 
is still good on the electrodes going to
recap<00:02:25.290> them<00:02:25.590> and<00:02:25.710> put<00:02:25.830> them<00:02:25.920> back<00:02:26.070> in<00:02:26.400> should

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
recap them and put them back in should

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:30.350 
recap them and put them back in should
be<00:02:26.940> fine<00:02:28.220> until<00:02:29.220> the<00:02:29.340> next<00:02:29.520> service<00:02:29.940> interval

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
be fine until the next service interval

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.380 
be fine until the next service interval
