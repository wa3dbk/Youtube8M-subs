00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.580 
hundred and twenty-one but I was in a
different<00:02:12.269> car<00:02:12.420> and<00:02:12.630> I've<00:02:12.959> never<00:02:13.110> used<00:02:13.380> the

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
different car and I've never used the

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.259 
different car and I've never used the
nitrous<00:02:13.950> yet<00:02:14.190> so<00:02:14.370> if<00:02:14.430> I<00:02:14.519> was<00:02:14.670> to<00:02:14.700> actually<00:02:14.910> use

00:02:15.259 --> 00:02:15.269 
nitrous yet so if I was to actually use

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:16.789 
nitrous yet so if I was to actually use
that<00:02:15.510> it<00:02:15.750> would<00:02:15.870> run<00:02:16.019> a<00:02:16.080> pretty<00:02:16.350> probably

00:02:16.789 --> 00:02:16.799 
that it would run a pretty probably

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:18.860 
that it would run a pretty probably
intensity<00:02:17.640> let's<00:02:18.090> say<00:02:18.209> those<00:02:18.329> things<00:02:18.450> Cindy's

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870

got nitrous on everything you'd stand a

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.380 
got nitrous on everything you'd stand a
chance<00:02:22.560> of<00:02:22.920> busting<00:02:23.370> things<00:02:23.610> soon<00:02:23.970> early<00:02:24.329> as

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.660 
like I said that's called a power adder
and<00:02:39.570> thus<00:02:39.930> yeah<00:02:40.110> chargers<00:02:40.620> also<00:02:41.130> power<00:02:41.340> out

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
and thus yeah chargers also power out

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.430 
and thus yeah chargers also power out
right<00:02:41.940> it's<00:02:42.090> like<00:02:42.209> normally<00:02:42.660> aspirated<00:02:42.840> and

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
right it's like normally aspirated and

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:44.190 
right it's like normally aspirated and
then

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200
