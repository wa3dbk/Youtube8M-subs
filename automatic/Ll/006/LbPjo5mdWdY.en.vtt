user did in the computer you can't be so

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.230 
user did in the computer you can't be so
off<00:01:31.520> argumentum<00:01:32.520> right<00:01:32.670> off<00:01:32.790> the<00:01:32.939> bat<00:01:33.090> you

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
off argumentum right off the bat you

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.670 
off argumentum right off the bat you
know<00:01:33.299> just<00:01:33.570> kind<00:01:33.750> of<00:01:33.780> pointed<00:01:34.140> what<00:01:34.290> did<00:01:34.500> you

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680

do even though they did do something

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.100 
do even though they did do something
that<00:01:36.240> would<00:01:36.360> probably<00:01:36.689> get<00:01:36.750> the<00:01:36.900> problem

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
that would probably get the problem

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.590 
that would probably get the problem
solved<00:01:37.590> faster<00:01:37.850> but<00:01:38.850> anyways<00:01:39.090> people<00:01:39.390> lie<00:01:39.570> all

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600
