00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:03.870 
so last week we did a basic program like

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:06.320 
so last week we did a basic program like
this<00:00:04.310> that<00:00:05.310> you<00:00:05.460> see<00:00:05.490> on<00:00:05.700> your<00:00:05.790> screen<00:00:05.879> here

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:06.330 
this that you see on your screen here

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.680 
this that you see on your screen here
where<00:00:06.779> you<00:00:06.930> have<00:00:07.490> the<00:00:08.490> red<00:00:08.910> LEDs<00:00:09.360> flashing

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
where you have the red LEDs flashing

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.839 
where you have the red LEDs flashing
when<00:00:09.990> the<00:00:10.080> button<00:00:10.290> is<00:00:10.349> pressed<00:00:10.590> and<00:00:10.980> when<00:00:11.759> the

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
when the button is pressed and when the

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:13.669 
when the button is pressed and when the
button<00:00:12.120> is<00:00:12.210> impressed<00:00:12.660> you've<00:00:13.019> got<00:00:13.230> the<00:00:13.410> green

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
button is impressed you've got the green

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.450 
button is impressed you've got the green
light<00:00:13.740> on<00:00:14.250> and<00:00:14.610> the<00:00:14.670> red<00:00:14.910> lights<00:00:15.150> set<00:00:15.570> to<00:00:15.750> low

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:16.460 
light on and the red lights set to low

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:22.609 
light on and the red lights set to low
the<00:00:20.119> all<00:00:21.119> right<00:00:21.330> so<00:00:21.390> pins<00:00:21.720> four<00:00:21.990> and<00:00:22.230> five<00:00:22.439> are

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
the all right so pins four and five are

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.560 
the all right so pins four and five are
set<00:00:22.800> to<00:00:22.920> low<00:00:23.070> now<00:00:23.970> what<00:00:24.180> we're<00:00:24.300> going<00:00:24.390> to<00:00:24.449> do

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
set to low now what we're going to do

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.370 
set to low now what we're going to do
first<00:00:24.810> is<00:00:24.960> we're<00:00:25.109> going<00:00:25.230> to<00:00:25.350> put<00:00:26.310> these<00:00:27.050> in<00:00:28.050> as

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
first is we're going to put these in as

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.050 
first is we're going to put these in as
some<00:00:28.590> subroutines<00:00:29.189> just<00:00:29.519> to<00:00:29.609> make<00:00:29.789> this<00:00:30.000> a

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
some subroutines just to make this a

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.990 
some subroutines just to make this a
little<00:00:30.449> bit<00:00:31.099> easier<00:00:32.099> to<00:00:32.160> read<00:00:32.399> and<00:00:32.640> easier<00:00:32.759> to

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
little bit easier to read and easier to

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:33.350 
little bit easier to read and easier to
follow

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
follow

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.440 
follow
so<00:00:33.930> go<00:00:34.050> ahead<00:00:34.140> into<00:00:34.500> the<00:00:34.530> control<00:00:35.239> panel<00:00:36.239> and

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
so go ahead into the control panel and

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.660 
so go ahead into the control panel and
pull<00:00:36.960> out<00:00:37.079> this<00:00:37.290> subroutine<00:00:38.780> command<00:00:39.780> and

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:40.670 
pull out this subroutine command and

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:44.900 
pull out this subroutine command and
grab<00:00:41.670> your<00:00:41.910> flash<00:00:42.300> pattern<00:00:42.780> here<00:00:43.250> and<00:00:44.250> pull<00:00:44.820> it

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
grab your flash pattern here and pull it

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.090 
grab your flash pattern here and pull it
into<00:00:45.059> there<00:00:45.270> and<00:00:45.600> we're<00:00:45.870> gonna<00:00:45.960> rename<00:00:46.800> this

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
into there and we're gonna rename this

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:55.970 
into there and we're gonna rename this
flash<00:00:51.530> once<00:00:52.530> you<00:00:52.680> rename<00:00:52.980> that<00:00:53.190> flash<00:00:54.980> we're

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
flash once you rename that flash we're

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.420 
flash once you rename that flash we're
gonna<00:00:56.100> go<00:00:56.280> ahead<00:00:56.399> and<00:00:56.640> want<00:00:56.879> to<00:00:57.000> grab<00:00:57.570> an

00:00:58.420 --> 00:00:58.430 
gonna go ahead and want to grab an

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:01.010 
gonna go ahead and want to grab an
instance<00:00:59.430> refer<00:01:00.000> to<00:01:00.120> that<00:01:00.239> several<00:01:00.600> teams<00:01:00.809> say

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
instance refer to that several teams say

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.560 
instance refer to that several teams say
go<00:01:01.170> to<00:01:01.230> the<00:01:01.379> control<00:01:01.739> panel<00:01:02.239> scroll<00:01:03.239> down<00:01:03.449> to

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
go to the control panel scroll down to

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.320 
go to the control panel scroll down to
the<00:01:03.660> bottom<00:01:03.840> and<00:01:04.710> you'll<00:01:05.580> see<00:01:05.760> this<00:01:05.820> option<00:01:06.210> to

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
the bottom and you'll see this option to

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.510 
the bottom and you'll see this option to
pull<00:01:06.510> up<00:01:06.600> a<00:01:06.750> subroutine<00:01:07.260> go<00:01:08.130> ahead<00:01:08.280> and<00:01:08.400> pull

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
pull up a subroutine go ahead and pull

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.340 
pull up a subroutine go ahead and pull
it<00:01:08.549> up<00:01:09.470> and<00:01:11.240> we<00:01:12.240> have<00:01:12.390> to<00:01:12.420> name<00:01:12.659> it<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:12.810> exact

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
it up and we have to name it the exact

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.130 
it up and we have to name it the exact
same<00:01:13.799> thing<00:01:14.159> don't<00:01:14.880> put<00:01:15.060> any<00:01:15.210> spaces<00:01:15.540> in<00:01:15.960> there

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
same thing don't put any spaces in there

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.530 
same thing don't put any spaces in there
so<00:01:16.380> if<00:01:16.500> it's<00:01:16.650> a<00:01:16.740> capital<00:01:17.189> F<00:01:17.430> you<00:01:18.119> need<00:01:18.299> to<00:01:18.390> use<00:01:18.509> a

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
so if it's a capital F you need to use a

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.450 
so if it's a capital F you need to use a
capital<00:01:18.840> F<00:01:19.200> over<00:01:19.740> here<00:01:19.950> so<00:01:20.700> go<00:01:20.850> ahead<00:01:20.909> and<00:01:22.460> call

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
capital F over here so go ahead and call

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.850 
capital F over here so go ahead and call
that<00:01:23.490> flash<00:01:23.960> and<00:01:24.960> let's<00:01:25.170> go<00:01:25.290> ahead<00:01:25.409> and<00:01:25.710> let's

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
that flash and let's go ahead and let's

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:31.380 
that flash and let's go ahead and let's
do<00:01:26.159> another<00:01:26.960> subroutine

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:31.390 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:38.640 

and<00:01:31.630> we'll<00:01:32.530> call<00:01:32.710> this<00:01:33.120> green<00:01:35.400> and<00:01:37.470> we'll<00:01:38.470> do

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:38.650 
and we'll call this green and we'll do

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:42.450 
and we'll call this green and we'll do
the<00:01:38.890> first<00:01:39.040> letter<00:01:41.100> follow<00:01:42.100> the<00:01:42.250> same

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:42.460 
the first letter follow the same

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:44.430 
the first letter follow the same
capitalization<00:01:43.330> pattern<00:01:43.690> that<00:01:43.810> I<00:01:43.930> use<00:01:44.170> here

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:44.440 
capitalization pattern that I use here

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:47.730 
capitalization pattern that I use here
so<00:01:45.370> now<00:01:45.520> we<00:01:45.580> need<00:01:45.790> to<00:01:45.850> refer<00:01:46.750> to<00:01:46.780> that<00:01:47.080> so<00:01:47.500> we<00:01:47.590> go

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:47.740 
so now we need to refer to that so we go

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:49.920 
so now we need to refer to that so we go
to<00:01:47.770> the<00:01:47.920> control<00:01:48.280> panel<00:01:48.750> pull<00:01:49.750> out<00:01:49.900> a

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:49.930 
to the control panel pull out a

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:54.930 
to the control panel pull out a
subroutine<00:01:50.350> and<00:01:50.920> I<00:01:51.790> will<00:01:51.940> call<00:01:52.150> this<00:01:53.940> change

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:54.940 
subroutine and I will call this change

00:01:54.940 --> 00:02:00.240 
subroutine and I will call this change
the<00:01:55.180> name<00:01:55.420> of<00:01:55.600> this<00:01:55.870> to<00:01:56.650> green<00:01:57.040> on<00:01:57.970> I<00:01:59.160> go<00:02:00.160> ahead

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:00.250 
the name of this to green on I go ahead

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:02.550 
the name of this to green on I go ahead
and<00:02:00.370> run<00:02:00.520> this<00:02:00.970> on<00:02:01.180> your<00:02:01.330> dwee<00:02:01.900> note<00:02:02.080> and<00:02:02.320> check

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:02.560 
and run this on your dwee note and check

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:03.270 
and run this on your dwee note and check
that<00:02:02.680> it<00:02:02.800> works

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.280 
that it works

to<00:02:19.480> do<00:02:19.540> a<00:02:19.570> screen<00:02:19.930> clipping<00:02:21.510> you're<00:02:22.510> going<00:02:22.750> to

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
to do a screen clipping you're going to

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:30.000 
to do a screen clipping you're going to
go<00:02:23.230> ahead<00:02:23.470> and<00:02:24.209> select<00:02:26.400> your<00:02:27.400> program<00:02:28.860> and<00:02:29.860> it

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
go ahead and select your program and it

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.670 
go ahead and select your program and it
should<00:02:30.220> add<00:02:30.459> it<00:02:30.640> to<00:02:30.730> the<00:02:30.850> word<00:02:31.000> document<00:02:31.680> go

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
should add it to the word document go

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.710 
should add it to the word document go
ahead<00:02:32.860> and<00:02:33.010> save<00:02:33.340> that<00:02:33.420> we're<00:02:34.420> gonna<00:02:34.510> do<00:02:34.690> a

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
ahead and save that we're gonna do a

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.440 
ahead and save that we're gonna do a
couple<00:02:34.959> more<00:02:35.260> and<00:02:35.440> then<00:02:35.850> you<00:02:36.850> will<00:02:37.030> email<00:02:37.360> them

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
couple more and then you will email them

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.610 
couple more and then you will email them
to<00:02:37.510> me<00:02:39.600> the<00:02:40.600> next<00:02:40.810> step<00:02:40.930> is<00:02:41.200> that<00:02:41.230> we're<00:02:41.470> going

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
to me the next step is that we're going

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.970 
to me the next step is that we're going
to<00:02:41.739> start<00:02:42.070> using<00:02:42.280> a<00:02:42.489> variable<00:02:43.739> let's<00:02:44.739> go<00:02:44.890> ahead

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
to start using a variable let's go ahead

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:48.360 
to start using a variable let's go ahead
and<00:02:45.160> pull<00:02:45.340> this<00:02:45.489> loop<00:02:45.670> out<00:02:46.290> this<00:02:47.290> function<00:02:48.250> out

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
and pull this loop out this function out

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:51.930 
and pull this loop out this function out
and<00:02:49.239> get<00:02:50.140> rid<00:02:50.260> of<00:02:50.290> this<00:02:50.500> one<00:02:50.709> now<00:02:50.950> let's<00:02:51.700> go<00:02:51.880> to

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940 
and get rid of this one now let's go to

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:55.949 
and get rid of this one now let's go to
the<00:02:52.209> control<00:02:52.739> and<00:02:53.880> we're<00:02:54.880> going<00:02:55.150> to<00:02:55.180> use<00:02:55.600> its

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:55.959 
the control and we're going to use its

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:58.650 
the control and we're going to use its
up<00:02:56.080> at<00:02:56.230> the<00:02:56.320> top<00:02:56.560> the<00:02:56.980> program<00:02:57.430> with<00:02:58.269> the<00:02:58.420> setup

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:58.660 
up at the top the program with the setup

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:01.740 
up at the top the program with the setup
antelope<00:02:59.790> so<00:03:00.790> we<00:03:00.880> can<00:03:00.970> go<00:03:01.060> ahead<00:03:01.120> put<00:03:01.450> this<00:03:01.570> in

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
antelope so we can go ahead put this in

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:05.039 
antelope so we can go ahead put this in
the<00:03:01.810> loop<00:03:01.930> part<00:03:02.190> in<00:03:03.190> the<00:03:03.370> setup<00:03:03.640> part<00:03:04.049> we're

00:03:05.039 --> 00:03:05.049 
the loop part in the setup part we're

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:09.539 
the loop part in the setup part we're
going<00:03:05.260> to<00:03:06.780> do<00:03:07.780> something<00:03:08.709> called<00:03:08.890> variables

00:03:09.539 --> 00:03:09.549 
going to do something called variables

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:12.180 
going to do something called variables
now<00:03:10.540> we're<00:03:10.690> going<00:03:10.810> to<00:03:10.930> set<00:03:11.440> an<00:03:11.739> integer

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:12.190 
now we're going to set an integer

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:20.430 
now we're going to set an integer
variable<00:03:14.010> we're<00:03:15.010> gonna<00:03:15.130> call<00:03:15.430> this<00:03:15.670> variable

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:30.690 

flash<00:03:21.100> time<00:03:22.620> lowercase<00:03:23.620> F<00:03:26.880> capital<00:03:27.880> T<00:03:29.700> and

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:30.700 
flash time lowercase F capital T and

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:41.040 
flash time lowercase F capital T and
we'll<00:03:31.090> set<00:03:31.300> this<00:03:31.510> to<00:03:35.130> 250<00:03:36.130> no<00:03:36.930> 250<00:03:39.510> now<00:03:40.510> the

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:41.050 
we'll set this to 250 no 250 now the

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:44.460 
we'll set this to 250 no 250 now the
neat<00:03:41.260> thing<00:03:41.470> that<00:03:41.620> we<00:03:41.740> can<00:03:41.920> do<00:03:42.330> is<00:03:43.330> we<00:03:44.320> can

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
neat thing that we can do is we can

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:49.470 
neat thing that we can do is we can
clone<00:03:44.770> this<00:03:45.300> we<00:03:46.300> can<00:03:46.480> bring<00:03:46.720> it<00:03:46.870> down<00:03:46.900> here<00:03:48.480> and

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:49.480 
clone this we can bring it down here and

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:57.320 
clone this we can bring it down here and
replace<00:03:50.280> the<00:03:51.280> thousand<00:03:53.100> bit<00:03:54.100> the<00:03:54.310> flash<00:03:54.580> time

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:57.330 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:04.490 

and<00:03:58.330> what<00:03:58.780> that<00:03:59.020> does

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:09.240 

clone<00:04:05.500> it<00:04:05.650> again<00:04:06.450> what<00:04:07.450> that<00:04:07.660> does<00:04:07.900> is<00:04:08.250> any

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:09.250 
clone it again what that does is any

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:12.180 
clone it again what that does is any
instance<00:04:09.880> now<00:04:10.200> we<00:04:11.200> can<00:04:11.410> change<00:04:11.680> our<00:04:11.920> flash

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:12.190 
instance now we can change our flash

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:14.400 
instance now we can change our flash
time<00:04:12.400> just<00:04:12.940> by<00:04:13.120> simply<00:04:13.570> changing<00:04:13.780> one<00:04:14.200> number

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:14.410 
time just by simply changing one number

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:19.259 
time just by simply changing one number
so<00:04:15.120> we've<00:04:16.120> only<00:04:16.299> got<00:04:16.540> two<00:04:16.840> here<00:04:17.410> but<00:04:18.370> if<00:04:18.910> we<00:04:18.970> had

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:19.269 
so we've only got two here but if we had

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:22.620 
so we've only got two here but if we had
four<00:04:19.570> five<00:04:19.840> six<00:04:20.260> twenty<00:04:20.859> different<00:04:21.580> times<00:04:21.820> it

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:22.630 
four five six twenty different times it

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:24.540 
four five six twenty different times it
will<00:04:23.020> be<00:04:23.170> a<00:04:23.200> lot<00:04:23.410> easier<00:04:23.440> if<00:04:23.980> you<00:04:24.100> just<00:04:24.130> have<00:04:24.430> to

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:24.550 
will be a lot easier if you just have to

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:25.710 
will be a lot easier if you just have to
change<00:04:24.760> it<00:04:24.910> in<00:04:25.030> one<00:04:25.060> place

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:25.720 
change it in one place

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:30.150 
change it in one place
so<00:04:26.380> go<00:04:26.500> ahead<00:04:27.060> upload<00:04:28.060> this<00:04:28.180> to<00:04:28.360> Arduino<00:04:29.160> and

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:30.160 
so go ahead upload this to Arduino and

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:34.140 
so go ahead upload this to Arduino and
test<00:04:30.880> it<00:04:31.030> out<00:04:31.120> see<00:04:31.180> that<00:04:31.630> it<00:04:31.720> works<00:04:33.030> once<00:04:34.030> you

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:34.150 
test it out see that it works once you

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:35.400 
test it out see that it works once you
see<00:04:34.300> that<00:04:34.330> it<00:04:34.570> works<00:04:34.690> you<00:04:35.020> could<00:04:35.200> do<00:04:35.380> a

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:35.410 
see that it works you could do a

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:41.040 
see that it works you could do a
different<00:04:35.770> value<00:04:37.620> maybe<00:04:38.620> five<00:04:39.010> hundred<00:04:40.050> maybe

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:41.050 
different value maybe five hundred maybe

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:46.260 
different value maybe five hundred maybe
you<00:04:41.200> want<00:04:41.350> something<00:04:41.560> faster<00:04:42.160> maybe<00:04:43.230> 175<00:04:45.270> and

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:46.270 
you want something faster maybe 175 and

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:48.620 
you want something faster maybe 175 and
uploaded<00:04:47.169> to<00:04:47.260> Arduino<00:04:47.710> see<00:04:48.070> that<00:04:48.250> it<00:04:48.340> works

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:48.630 
uploaded to Arduino see that it works

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:51.330 
uploaded to Arduino see that it works
once<00:04:49.630> you<00:04:49.780> see<00:04:49.960> that<00:04:49.990> it<00:04:50.200> works<00:04:50.350> go<00:04:50.800> ahead<00:04:51.010> and

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:51.340 
once you see that it works go ahead and

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:55.320 
once you see that it works go ahead and
insert<00:04:51.880> a<00:04:52.270> screen<00:04:53.080> clipping<00:04:53.410> of<00:04:53.620> this<00:04:54.330> into

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:55.330 
insert a screen clipping of this into

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:59.070 
insert a screen clipping of this into
your<00:04:55.540> Word<00:04:56.290> document<00:04:57.070> then<00:04:57.970> call<00:04:58.240> it<00:04:58.450> flash

00:04:59.070 --> 00:04:59.080 
your Word document then call it flash

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:04.350 
your Word document then call it flash
time<00:04:59.530> variable<00:05:02.730> once<00:05:03.730> you<00:05:03.850> have<00:05:04.000> those<00:05:04.150> basic

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:04.360 
time variable once you have those basic

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:06.060 
time variable once you have those basic
requirements<00:05:05.140> I<00:05:05.200> want<00:05:05.350> to<00:05:05.530> just<00:05:05.770> see<00:05:05.950> if<00:05:06.010> you

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:06.070 
requirements I want to just see if you

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:08.220 
requirements I want to just see if you
could<00:05:06.220> do<00:05:06.970> a<00:05:07.000> program<00:05:07.419> where<00:05:07.600> you<00:05:07.630> have<00:05:07.720> two<00:05:08.050> or

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:08.230 
could do a program where you have two or

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:09.750 
could do a program where you have two or
three<00:05:08.260> different<00:05:08.530> variables<00:05:09.010> for<00:05:09.730> a

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:09.760 
three different variables for a

three different variables for a
different<00:05:10.120> flash<00:05:10.710> patterns<00:05:11.710> if<00:05:12.040> you<00:05:12.940> need<00:05:13.330> to

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:14.010 
different flash patterns if you need to

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:16.080 
different flash patterns if you need to
then<00:05:15.010> I<00:05:15.130> want<00:05:15.310> you<00:05:15.400> to<00:05:15.430> go<00:05:15.610> ahead<00:05:15.700> and<00:05:15.910> copy

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:16.090 
then I want you to go ahead and copy
