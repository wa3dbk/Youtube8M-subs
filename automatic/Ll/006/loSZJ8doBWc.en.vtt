00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.349
(introductory music)

00:00:04.349 --> 00:00:08.051
- Ohh, it's like a bee.
Is that, is that EDM?

00:00:09.558 --> 00:00:11.658
(laughter)

00:00:11.658 --> 00:00:12.503

00:00:17.671 --> 00:00:18.910
- Very little, very little.

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:21.091
- Brittney, tell them
what we're making today!

00:00:21.091 --> 00:00:22.968
- The White Christmas martini.

00:00:22.968 --> 00:00:25.302
- Exactly homeboy. Okay,
perfect for Christmas

00:00:25.302 --> 00:00:27.441
and everything we use, except the booze,

00:00:27.441 --> 00:00:29.007
we got at BarProducts.com.

00:00:29.007 --> 00:00:31.151
So, let me show you how to make this drink

00:00:31.151 --> 00:00:33.899
with these little fancy
decorations and stuff on top.

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:34.755
- Booya!

00:00:34.755 --> 00:00:37.449
- Vanilla vodka, Fireball, Amaretto,

00:00:37.449 --> 00:00:39.461
all the same time, go.

00:00:39.461 --> 00:00:41.610
Ooooh...

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.016
Top that with coconut milk.

00:00:43.016 --> 00:00:45.088
Ooooh, it's thick.

00:00:45.088 --> 00:00:46.271
I know it lets, you're like, "Oh my God,

00:00:46.271 --> 00:00:47.389
"that is so thick, what is that?

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:48.232
"Is it yogurt?"

00:00:48.232 --> 00:00:50.168
No, it's coconut milk, okay?
- It smells good.

00:00:50.168 --> 00:00:51.525
- It just has that look.

00:00:52.078 --> 00:00:52.863
Smell that though, now tell me that's...

00:00:52.863 --> 00:00:54.132
- It smells really good.

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:57.884
- You look scared. You can't be scared.

00:00:57.884 --> 00:00:59.197
You have to manhandle stuff.

00:00:59.197 --> 00:01:00.365
Be rough, okay?

00:01:00.365 --> 00:01:05.020
Shake it and keep it sexy! (laughter)

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.880
Go head, go ahead Brittney. Go ahead. Yes.

00:01:09.587 --> 00:01:11.671
Uh huh, uh huh, uh huh (laughter)

00:01:11.671 --> 00:01:13.342
Now a little spin.

00:01:14.464 --> 00:01:16.561
- Uh uh (laughter)

00:01:19.514 --> 00:01:21.219
Ahh, shake weight.

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:22.492
- You can dance, you know?

00:01:22.492 --> 00:01:23.231
- I can?

00:01:23.231 --> 00:01:24.430
- Yeah!

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:25.641
- Can sing with how many...

00:01:25.641 --> 00:01:27.104
see, see, see?

00:01:27.104 --> 00:01:29.366
If you can't dance, you can't
do that with that kinda flow.

00:01:30.734 --> 00:01:32.074
- I can do this.

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:37.142
- This right here is a salt rimmer.

00:01:37.142 --> 00:01:39.026
We use this to rim our martini glass.

00:01:39.026 --> 00:01:41.406
You could use it for margaritas,

00:01:41.406 --> 00:01:43.927
martinis, sprinkles...
- Bloody Mary's.

00:01:43.927 --> 00:01:45.471
- Yeah, whatever you need.

00:01:45.471 --> 00:01:48.234
Whatever juices or rimming
sugars or whatever,

00:01:48.234 --> 00:01:50.245
you put it in here and it's good to go.

00:01:50.829 --> 00:01:54.276
- Mmm, ooooh!

00:01:54.276 --> 00:01:58.011
Oh, look at that. Gorgeous. Gorgeous.

00:01:58.011 --> 00:01:59.455
I made that. You know that, right?

00:01:59.455 --> 00:02:00.190
- Perfect!

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:01.983
Now, we have some really cool stencils

00:02:01.983 --> 00:02:04.779
to put a design on top of this drink.

00:02:04.779 --> 00:02:05.585
Okay?

00:02:05.585 --> 00:02:07.364
And this right here is a cinnamon shaker.

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:08.679
Go ahead, so grate.

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:10.772
This is, there's a whole nutmeg, okay?

00:02:10.772 --> 00:02:13.396
So we get really, really fresh nutmeg.

00:02:14.042 --> 00:02:16.099
Okay, that's good, scrape
just a little sprinkle.

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:17.475
Okay, that's it.

00:02:17.691 --> 00:02:19.197
A little bit more on the side.

00:02:22.965 --> 00:02:25.484
Present the drink!
- - And there you have it!

00:02:25.484 --> 00:02:27.636
The white Christmas martini.

00:02:27.636 --> 00:02:29.119
- Exactly homeboy!

00:02:29.119 --> 00:02:30.637
Are you ready for this one?

00:02:31.128 --> 00:02:33.761
- Ooh, excited and scared.

00:02:36.775 --> 00:02:38.907
Mmmm...

00:02:38.907 --> 00:02:40.028
- Mmm, what?

00:02:40.628 --> 00:02:44.774

feel like Christmas is whole.
