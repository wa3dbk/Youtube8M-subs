00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:21.230

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:24.619
 onions and chopped green onions for a 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:27.460
 tempted to prepare today's recipe is 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:27.460
 too fast 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:35.210
 so I'm going to use this panela vote is 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:41.120
 ideal for preparation and oriental 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:43.580
 get ready in office jorge ficadinha 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.950
 Oriental is from these super voted recipes 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:47.660
 in which we love and not only because it gives 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:50.180
 to change the ingredients with which you 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:52.039
 have on hand she is elegant enough 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:54.680
 to receive a couple of friends at home 

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:58.579
 already so practical that it goes very well in the day 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:59.629
 By day children love at least 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:01.399
 my 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:03.020
 I 'll prepare the letter because besides 

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:05.089
 I want her to cut into 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:06.560
 stay a little off the fridge 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:09.080
 She has to stay at temperature. 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:11.600
 This environment guarantees more 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:14.990
 golden and softer after ready 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:17.330
 if you have rich you can use filet mignon 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:20.119
 now if you have a problem with a scorpion 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:23.110
 of the pocket as I can use other cuts 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:23.110
 as opposed to fillet 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:32.110
 here is 500 grams and you saw that it is 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.110
 facinho to cut at home 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:43.880
 all ingredients are already recorded 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:46.119
 Let's start with the ball to cut into 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:48.890
 half moon I find this simpler way 

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:51.470
 so thicker slices are 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:53.390
 crisp after each 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:55.640
 ingredient may have a format such as 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:57.700
 zucchini and half moon the peppers will be 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.930
 framed medium 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.970
 I chose red because I 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:08.750
 I like but if you have a green there 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:10.459
 giving soup have to see I 'll use these 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:11.959
 paris mushrooms because they are 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:15.140
 easy to find around here 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:17.660
 mainly because it already has as 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.430
 she is very annoying to clean it is a 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.230
 sponge and sucks all water can not 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.269
 leave to soak in the bowl 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:25.540
 ie you have to clean one by one with a 

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:28.760
 wet dishcloth 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:31.340
 the proof of other types of mushroom as 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:34.160
 shimeji shitake the Wellington is also 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:36.590
 delicious now it is better to use the fresh ones 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:40.040
 than I know we're going to a little pepper 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:42.490
 one likes not to use this one will feel good 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.490
 slim 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:49.010
 go for the cut the pepper washed the 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:52.170
 hands 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:55.140
 nowadays that super used to prepare 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:57.000
 the oriental in general it grater is 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:58.710

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.410
 freedom in sao paulo 

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:03.420
 but you can also get the very thin 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:06.000
 common grater leaves the lint 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:08.010
 ginger in food the time that people 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.780
 takes to prepare the ingredients is 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.250
 enough for it to reach the 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:16.440
 right temperature 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:18.720
 and I will also leave the thickening 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:22.050
 French cuisine that uses flour 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:23.100
 and butter in the oriental is corn friend 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:25.320
 with water 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:28.290
 this mixture that will give that point 

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:31.230
 Grossinho of here have half a cup of 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:32.640

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:34.730

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:39.720
 classic oriental cuisine 

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:42.690

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:11.160
 any time is just typing 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:12.120

 meat is in the pan 

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:29.340
 It's only after it's ok, it's hot that the 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:30.330
 People shower with oil as corn itself 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:32.460

 account pans are fundamental to give 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:51.150

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:02.520
 two minutes 

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:05.100
 here you can leave the middle meat of 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:08.120

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:46.480
 I cry sugar because I arrived yesterday 

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:50.100
