cell memory foam another thing is that
when<00:01:51.720> you<00:01:51.869> put<00:01:52.110> a<00:01:52.140> saddle<00:01:52.560> on<00:01:53.450> the<00:01:54.450> Cavallo<00:01:54.840> pad

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
when you put a saddle on the Cavallo pad

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.590 
when you put a saddle on the Cavallo pad
you<00:01:56.219> can<00:01:56.430> put<00:01:56.610> your<00:01:56.759> finger<00:01:57.090> right<00:01:57.240> there<00:01:57.479> and

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
you can put your finger right there and

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:03.230 
you can put your finger right there and
dent<00:01:58.020> it<00:01:58.200> in<00:01:58.640> just<00:01:59.640> dent<00:02:00.000> it<00:02:00.240> right<00:02:00.479> in<00:02:02.240> what

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
dent it in just dent it right in what

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.060 
dent it in just dent it right in what
does<00:02:03.360> that<00:02:03.390> mean<00:02:03.719> well<00:02:04.170> it<00:02:04.290> means<00:02:04.320> wherever

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
does that mean well it means wherever

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.010 
does that mean well it means wherever
there's<00:02:05.310> pressure<00:02:05.640> put<00:02:06.030> on<00:02:06.149> it<00:02:06.329> it<00:02:06.509> will<00:02:06.630> dent

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
there's pressure put on it it will dent

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.520 
there's pressure put on it it will dent
in<00:02:07.459> like<00:02:08.459> your<00:02:08.759> temper<00:02:09.390> mattress<00:02:09.840> will<00:02:10.080> when

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
in like your temper mattress will when

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.490 
in like your temper mattress will when
you<00:02:10.649> lie<00:02:10.860> on<00:02:10.890> it<00:02:11.280> so<00:02:12.209> if<00:02:12.450> it<00:02:12.660> dents

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
you lie on it so if it dents

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.640 
you lie on it so if it dents
then<00:02:14.250> your<00:02:14.400> saddle<00:02:14.850> is<00:02:14.970> getting<00:02:15.410> deeper<00:02:16.410> into

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
then your saddle is getting deeper into

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.240 
then your saddle is getting deeper into
the<00:02:17.240> open<00:02:18.240> cell<00:02:18.450> memory<00:02:18.840> foam<00:02:19.020> and<00:02:19.320> if<00:02:19.980> you<00:02:20.070> go

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
the open cell memory foam and if you go

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.640 
the open cell memory foam and if you go
on<00:02:20.430> the<00:02:20.610> Equus<00:02:21.480> online<00:02:21.810> university<00:02:22.440> you'll

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
on the Equus online university you'll

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.980 
on the Equus online university you'll
see<00:02:22.980> the<00:02:23.490> tests<00:02:23.850> that<00:02:23.970> we<00:02:24.150> ran<00:02:24.390> with<00:02:24.960> a

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.990 
see the tests that we ran with a

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:28.070 
see the tests that we ran with a
computer<00:02:25.650> pad<00:02:25.920> under<00:02:26.820> it<00:02:26.940> to<00:02:27.150> test<00:02:27.420> where<00:02:27.960> the

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.630 
right track with that thing I know it
well<00:02:34.560> and<00:02:34.710> that's<00:02:34.920> the<00:02:35.130> point<00:02:35.340> of<00:02:35.520> the

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
well and that's the point of the

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.910 
well and that's the point of the
technology<00:02:36.390> is<00:02:36.630> that<00:02:36.660> so<00:02:37.140> many<00:02:37.230> people<00:02:37.560> fear

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
technology is that so many people fear

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.070 
technology is that so many people fear
the<00:02:38.130> technology<00:02:38.760> when<00:02:38.970> in<00:02:39.090> fact<00:02:39.330> it's<00:02:39.690> a<00:02:39.810> great

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
the technology when in fact it's a great

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.920 
the technology when in fact it's a great
tool<00:02:40.380> yeah<00:02:41.190> I'm<00:02:41.730> very<00:02:41.790> pleased<00:02:42.540> with<00:02:42.780> the

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
tool yeah I'm very pleased with the

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.530 
tool yeah I'm very pleased with the
results<00:02:43.380> of<00:02:43.440> this<00:02:43.590> today<00:02:44.300> this<00:02:45.300> is<00:02:45.510> the

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
results of this today this is the

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:50.630 
results of this today this is the
English<00:02:45.870> gut<00:02:46.850> okay<00:02:47.850> and<00:02:48.980> remember<00:02:49.980> that<00:02:50.190> when

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
English gut okay and remember that when

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.560 
English gut okay and remember that when
you<00:02:50.790> put<00:02:51.060> on<00:02:51.590> open<00:02:52.590> cell<00:02:52.830> memory<00:02:53.580> foam<00:02:53.850> and<00:02:54.090> the

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570 
you put on open cell memory foam and the

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:56.750 
you put on open cell memory foam and the
cavallo<00:02:54.870> pad<00:02:55.140> is<00:02:55.350> that<00:02:55.400> that<00:02:56.400> you<00:02:56.520> have<00:02:56.640> to

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
cavallo pad is that that you have to

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.640 
cavallo pad is that that you have to
girth<00:02:56.970> up<00:02:57.209> two<00:02:57.510> or<00:02:57.630> three<00:02:57.660> times<00:02:57.900> as<00:02:58.470> your

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
girth up two or three times as your

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:01.340 
girth up two or three times as your
saddle<00:02:59.010> seats<00:02:59.280> itself<00:02:59.760> into<00:03:00.750> the<00:03:00.870> memory<00:03:01.050> foam

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350 
saddle seats itself into the memory foam

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:04.100 
saddle seats itself into the memory foam
that's<00:03:02.280> another<00:03:02.640> downside<00:03:02.940> now<00:03:03.510> because<00:03:03.959> you

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 
that's another downside now because you

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:05.510 
that's another downside now because you
do<00:03:04.320> have<00:03:04.350> to<00:03:04.590> remember<00:03:04.860> to<00:03:05.100> girth<00:03:05.250> up

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:05.520 
do have to remember to girth up

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:07.900 
do have to remember to girth up
otherwise<00:03:06.000> your<00:03:06.300> your<00:03:06.930> girth<00:03:07.140> will<00:03:07.380> get<00:03:07.560> loose

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:07.910 
otherwise your your girth will get loose

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:11.510 
otherwise your your girth will get loose
the<00:03:08.910> surface<00:03:09.870> of<00:03:10.020> this<00:03:10.200> does<00:03:10.530> not<00:03:10.740> slide<00:03:11.130> under

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:11.520 
the surface of this does not slide under

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:13.400 
the surface of this does not slide under
your<00:03:11.670> saddle<00:03:11.880> unless<00:03:12.450> the<00:03:12.690> girth<00:03:12.870> is<00:03:13.110> really

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
your saddle unless the girth is really

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:16.790 
your saddle unless the girth is really
loose<00:03:13.620> and<00:03:13.920> then<00:03:14.070> it<00:03:14.820> could<00:03:15.060> slide<00:03:15.620> this<00:03:16.620> is

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:16.800 
loose and then it could slide this is

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:20.330 
loose and then it could slide this is
simply<00:03:17.250> the<00:03:17.370> endurance<00:03:17.880> cut<00:03:18.269> and<00:03:18.709> I<00:03:19.709> love<00:03:20.010> it<00:03:20.190> I

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
simply the endurance cut and I love it I

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.610 
simply the endurance cut and I love it I
use<00:03:20.850> it<00:03:21.360> under<00:03:21.570> a<00:03:21.600> western<00:03:21.989> saddle<00:03:22.350> all<00:03:22.500> the

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
use it under a western saddle all the

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:25.670 
use it under a western saddle all the
time<00:03:22.890> because<00:03:23.670> the<00:03:24.120> filet<00:03:24.540> on<00:03:24.810> it<00:03:24.989> is<00:03:25.170> actually

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
time because the filet on it is actually

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.949 
time because the filet on it is actually
big<00:03:25.890> enough<00:03:26.130> for<00:03:26.400> the<00:03:26.940> western<00:03:27.300> saddle<00:03:27.540> and

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959 
big enough for the western saddle and

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:32.180 
big enough for the western saddle and
here<00:03:28.950> is<00:03:29.130> the<00:03:29.370> western<00:03:29.760> cut<00:03:30.769> goes<00:03:31.769> under<00:03:32.070> the

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
here is the western cut goes under the

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.280 
here is the western cut goes under the
bigger<00:03:32.400> saddle<00:03:32.910> and<00:03:33.060> gets<00:03:33.600> under<00:03:33.750> the<00:03:33.989> skirts

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
bigger saddle and gets under the skirts

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:37.040 
bigger saddle and gets under the skirts
and<00:03:34.590> noticed<00:03:34.890> that<00:03:34.980> the<00:03:35.940> Cavallo<00:03:36.360> really<00:03:36.870> has

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:37.050 
and noticed that the Cavallo really has

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:39.020 
and noticed that the Cavallo really has
a<00:03:37.080> gullet<00:03:37.530> in<00:03:37.709> it<00:03:38.070> up<00:03:38.190> here<00:03:38.430> for<00:03:38.610> the<00:03:38.700> withers

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
a gullet in it up here for the withers

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:41.660 
a gullet in it up here for the withers
and<00:03:39.239> a<00:03:39.510> rise<00:03:40.080> in<00:03:40.110> front<00:03:40.650> of<00:03:40.739> the<00:03:40.830> saddle<00:03:41.250> I<00:03:41.340> put

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670 
and a rise in front of the saddle I put

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:45.170 
and a rise in front of the saddle I put
mine<00:03:41.850> quite<00:03:42.180> out<00:03:42.360> in<00:03:42.959> front<00:03:43.380> of<00:03:43.500> my<00:03:43.620> saddle<00:03:44.180> to

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
mine quite out in front of my saddle to

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:48.380 
mine quite out in front of my saddle to
allow<00:03:45.510> this<00:03:45.780> freedom<00:03:46.170> to<00:03:46.530> make<00:03:47.280> a<00:03:47.340> rise<00:03:47.670> in<00:03:48.000> a

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:48.390 
allow this freedom to make a rise in a

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:50.060 
allow this freedom to make a rise in a
gullet<00:03:48.690> there<00:03:48.870> they<00:03:49.049> also<00:03:49.230> have<00:03:49.560> one<00:03:49.739> called<00:03:49.769> a

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:50.070 
gullet there they also have one called a

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:54.500 
gullet there they also have one called a
bridge<00:03:50.930> this<00:03:51.930> is<00:03:51.989> the<00:03:52.500> full<00:03:52.709> monty<00:03:53.190> and<00:03:53.510> they

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:54.510 
bridge this is the full monty and they

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:56.330 
bridge this is the full monty and they
make<00:03:54.900> one<00:03:55.140> call<00:03:55.380> the<00:03:55.530> full<00:03:55.709> monty<00:03:56.040> because

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 
make one call the full monty because

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:00.500 
make one call the full monty because
it's<00:03:56.519> double<00:03:56.820> the<00:03:57.570> thickness<00:03:57.810> of<00:03:58.230> the<00:03:59.510> open

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
it's double the thickness of the open

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:05.770 
it's double the thickness of the open
cell<00:04:00.720> memory<00:04:00.989> foam<00:04:02.030> cavallo<00:04:03.030> pads<00:04:03.739> they<00:04:04.739> work

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:05.780 
cell memory foam cavallo pads they work

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:09.590 
cell memory foam cavallo pads they work
you<00:04:06.780> can<00:04:06.989> see<00:04:07.200> the<00:04:07.350> double<00:04:07.560> thickness<00:04:08.160> of<00:04:08.600> open

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:09.600 
you can see the double thickness of open

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:12.560 
you can see the double thickness of open
cell<00:04:09.810> memory<00:04:10.230> foam<00:04:10.470> right<00:04:10.500> here<00:04:11.160> you<00:04:12.120> also<00:04:12.150> can

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:12.570 
cell memory foam right here you also can

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:17.239 
cell memory foam right here you also can
see<00:04:13.080> that<00:04:13.380> it<00:04:14.160> lets<00:04:14.489> air<00:04:14.850> through
