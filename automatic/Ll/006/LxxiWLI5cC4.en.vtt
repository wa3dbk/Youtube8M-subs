you<00:00:46.320> everything<00:00:46.680> guys<00:00:46.950> so<00:00:47.219> let's<00:00:47.670> basically

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
you everything guys so let's basically

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.350 
you everything guys so let's basically
start<00:00:48.510> with<00:00:49.050> the<00:00:49.140> most<00:00:49.289> important<00:00:49.800> thing<00:00:50.010> of

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:50.360 
start with the most important thing of

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.330 
start with the most important thing of
recall<00:00:51.360> the<00:00:51.629> recall<00:00:51.960> is<00:00:52.110> pretty<00:00:52.379> high<00:00:52.620> on<00:00:52.949> this

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
recall the recall is pretty high on this

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.420 
recall the recall is pretty high on this
setup<00:00:53.760> it's<00:00:54.090> basically<00:00:54.600> zero<00:00:55.379> point<00:00:55.590> 33<00:00:55.949> for

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
setup it's basically zero point 33 for

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:57.920 
setup it's basically zero point 33 for
the<00:00:56.460> vertical<00:00:56.969> recall<00:00:57.239> as<00:00:57.360> you<00:00:57.449> can<00:00:57.600> see<00:00:57.780> the

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
the vertical recall as you can see the

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.979 
the vertical recall as you can see the
statistics<00:00:58.079> on<00:00:58.530> the<00:00:58.649> top<00:00:58.829> left<00:00:59.250> of<00:00:59.460> the<00:00:59.520> screen

00:00:59.979 --> 00:00:59.989

first<00:01:06.030> bullet<00:01:06.420> recall<00:01:06.900> those<00:01:07.229> like<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:08.040> root

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
first bullet recall those like the root

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.060 
first bullet recall those like the root
imagine<00:01:09.150> that<00:01:09.330> those<00:01:09.570> statistics<00:01:09.810> are<00:01:10.350> those

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
imagine that those statistics are those

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.520 
imagine that those statistics are those
rico<00:01:11.610> numbers<00:01:12.270> are<00:01:12.510> already<00:01:13.049> with<00:01:13.260> the<00:01:13.350> heavy

barrel and the frog rabanne and they're
not<00:01:15.509> like<00:01:16.200> they're<00:01:16.439> not<00:01:16.590> really<00:01:16.890> good<00:01:17.189> as<00:01:17.340> you

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
not like they're not really good as you

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.399 
not like they're not really good as you
can<00:01:17.580> see<00:01:17.790> and<00:01:18.000> the<00:01:18.299> enter<00:01:18.600> is<00:01:18.750> a<00:01:18.780> really<00:01:19.110> fast

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
can see and the enter is a really fast

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.679

weapon occur it suits with nine hundred
rpm<00:01:22.200> which<00:01:22.229> is<00:01:22.500> the<00:01:22.890> same<00:01:23.070> rpm<00:01:23.280> that<00:01:23.700> the<00:01:23.820> AK

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.140 
rpm which is the same rpm that the AK
has<00:01:24.720> an<00:01:24.990> has<00:01:25.320> worse<00:01:25.680> recall<00:01:26.280> so<00:01:26.670> from<00:01:27.030> the

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
has an has worse recall so from the

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.210 
has an has worse recall so from the
wrinkles<00:01:27.540> we<00:01:27.720> can<00:01:27.869> see<00:01:28.049> it's<00:01:28.200> not<00:01:28.409> such<00:01:28.920> a<00:01:28.950> good

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
wrinkles we can see it's not such a good

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.190 
wrinkles we can see it's not such a good
weapon<00:01:29.460> it<00:01:30.030> recalls<00:01:30.420> a<00:01:30.630> lot<00:01:30.840> to<00:01:31.049> the<00:01:31.079> right

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
weapon it recalls a lot to the right

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.460 
weapon it recalls a lot to the right
side<00:01:31.770> and<00:01:32.040> it<00:01:32.189> also<00:01:32.369> has<00:01:32.750> tremendous<00:01:33.750> first<00:01:34.290> of

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
all the recoil and the vertical wriggle

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.039 
all the recoil and the vertical wriggle
isn't<00:01:37.350> so<00:01:37.590> such<00:01:38.009> so<00:01:38.340> good<00:01:38.579> either<00:01:38.820> but<00:01:39.479> what<00:01:39.810> is

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
can see the accuracies tremendously low

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.690 
can see the accuracies tremendously low
while<00:01:50.520> standing<00:01:50.909> still<00:01:51.119> it<00:01:51.600> 0.225<00:01:52.590> and<00:01:53.100> while

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.510 
moving is only 0.3 60 imagine that on in
a<00:01:57.930> standard<00:01:58.380> result<00:01:58.680> rifle<00:01:59.159> with<00:01:59.310> no

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
a standard result rifle with no

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.760 
a standard result rifle with no
attachments<00:02:00.210> is<00:02:00.329> one<00:02:00.750> point<00:02:00.990> on<00:02:01.290> them<00:02:01.560> the

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
attachments is one point on them the

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.850 
attachments is one point on them the
movie<00:02:01.979> night<00:02:02.219> versus<00:02:02.689> 1.0<00:02:03.689> which<00:02:04.110> is<00:02:04.259> the<00:02:04.590> it's

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
movie night versus 1.0 which is the it's

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.730 
movie night versus 1.0 which is the it's
like<00:02:05.130> one-third<00:02:05.700> so<00:02:06.060> in<00:02:06.360> general<00:02:06.600> when<00:02:07.530> you're

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
like one-third so in general when you're

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.740 
like one-third so in general when you're
shooting<00:02:07.950> down<00:02:08.459> range<00:02:08.819> with<00:02:09.119> the<00:02:09.149> mtar<00:02:09.569> in

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
shooting down range with the mtar in

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.320 
shooting down range with the mtar in
automatic<00:02:10.289> it's<00:02:10.709> really<00:02:10.979> accurate<00:02:11.610> so<00:02:12.060> that's

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
automatic it's really accurate so that's

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.580 
automatic it's really accurate so that's
one<00:02:12.569> thing<00:02:12.810> that<00:02:12.870> you<00:02:13.230> need<00:02:13.379> to

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
one thing that you need to

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.130 
one thing that you need to
no<00:02:13.680> for<00:02:14.040> the<00:02:14.160> mtar<00:02:14.550> that<00:02:14.970> it<00:02:15.090> makes<00:02:15.330> it<00:02:15.690> good

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
no for the mtar that it makes it good

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:17.990 
no for the mtar that it makes it good
for<00:02:16.470> shooting<00:02:16.860> in<00:02:16.980> automatic<00:02:17.550> in<00:02:17.670> medium

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
for shooting in automatic in medium

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.400 
for shooting in automatic in medium
rates<00:02:18.209> it's<00:02:18.510> going<00:02:18.750> to<00:02:18.810> be<00:02:18.930> really<00:02:19.110> difficult

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
rates it's going to be really difficult

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.800 
rates it's going to be really difficult
to<00:02:19.980> control<00:02:20.310> the<00:02:20.580> recoil<00:02:20.790> in<00:02:21.239> really<00:02:21.569> long

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
to control the recoil in really long

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.350 
to control the recoil in really long
ranges<00:02:22.349> but<00:02:22.709> if<00:02:22.860> you<00:02:22.950> can<00:02:23.129> manage<00:02:23.370> it<00:02:23.670> you<00:02:24.209> can

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
ranges but if you can manage it you can

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.270 
ranges but if you can manage it you can
shoot<00:02:24.569> in<00:02:24.750> full<00:02:25.050> auto<00:02:25.260> and<00:02:25.590> still<00:02:26.010> hit<00:02:26.250> the

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
shoot in full auto and still hit the

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.309 
shoot in full auto and still hit the
target<00:02:26.760> because<00:02:26.910> it's<00:02:27.269> really<00:02:27.420> accurate<00:02:28.140> and

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:28.319 
target because it's really accurate and

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:30.650 
target because it's really accurate and
the<00:02:28.440> spread<00:02:28.769> is<00:02:28.950> pretty<00:02:29.459> good<00:02:29.819> let's<00:02:30.269> move<00:02:30.450> the

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
the spread is pretty good let's move the

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.710 
the spread is pretty good let's move the
hipfire<00:02:30.989> accuracy<00:02:31.620> as<00:02:31.950> you<00:02:32.040> can<00:02:32.190> see<00:02:32.340> is<00:02:32.720> 0.04

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
hipfire accuracy as you can see is 0.04

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.369 
hipfire accuracy as you can see is 0.04
standing<00:02:34.200> and<00:02:34.379> 0.7<00:02:35.370> for<00:02:35.700> moving<00:02:36.540> and<00:02:36.720> these

00:02:37.369 --> 00:02:37.379 
standing and 0.7 for moving and these

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:39.890 
standing and 0.7 for moving and these
are<00:02:37.739> pretty<00:02:38.129> good<00:02:38.580> statistics<00:02:39.299> because<00:02:39.540> in

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
are pretty good statistics because in

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.580 
are pretty good statistics because in
general<00:02:40.290> like<00:02:40.470> an<00:02:41.129> LMG<00:02:41.610> has<00:02:41.760> around<00:02:42.150> 5<00:02:42.599> 6<00:02:43.019> 4.5

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
general like an LMG has around 5 6 4.5

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:47.240 
general like an LMG has around 5 6 4.5
imagine<00:02:44.549> that<00:02:44.700> the<00:02:44.790> l<00:02:44.970> 86<00:02:45.239> has<00:02:45.660> 4.5<00:02:46.470> without

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
imagine that the l 86 has 4.5 without

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.009 
imagine that the l 86 has 4.5 without
any<00:02:47.430> attachments<00:02:48.060> 0<00:02:48.180> and<00:02:48.450> this<00:02:48.660> attachment

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:49.019 
any attachments 0 and this attachment

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:50.539 
any attachments 0 and this attachment
are<00:02:49.290> with<00:02:49.470> the<00:02:49.560> heavy<00:02:49.739> barrel<00:02:49.950> but<00:02:50.250> the<00:02:50.370> heavy

00:02:50.539 --> 00:02:50.549 
are with the heavy barrel but the heavy

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:52.160 
are with the heavy barrel but the heavy
barrel<00:02:50.760> actually<00:02:51.269> fucks<00:02:51.480> up<00:02:51.660> the<00:02:51.780> hip<00:02:51.959> fire

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
barrel actually fucks up the hip fire

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.740 
barrel actually fucks up the hip fire
accuracy<00:02:52.500> so<00:02:53.280> the<00:02:53.489> hipfire<00:02:53.700> is<00:02:54.150> really<00:02:54.569> good

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
accuracy so the hipfire is really good

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.440 
accuracy so the hipfire is really good
in<00:02:54.989> long-range<00:02:55.560> accuracy<00:02:56.459> is<00:02:56.760> pretty<00:02:57.150> good

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
in long-range accuracy is pretty good

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.110 
in long-range accuracy is pretty good
again<00:02:58.049> and<00:02:58.319> another<00:02:59.250> thing<00:02:59.579> about<00:02:59.819> the<00:02:59.970> heavy

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
again and another thing about the heavy

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.390 
again and another thing about the heavy
part<00:03:00.209> that<00:03:00.599> really<00:03:00.810> helps<00:03:01.769> this<00:03:01.890> weapon<00:03:02.280> as

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
part that really helps this weapon as

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.400 
part that really helps this weapon as
you<00:03:02.489> can<00:03:02.640> see<00:03:02.849> over<00:03:03.269> here<00:03:03.299> the<00:03:03.780> Dhamma<00:03:04.019> drop

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
you can see over here the Dhamma drop

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:07.640 
you can see over here the Dhamma drop
and<00:03:05.030> usually<00:03:06.030> at<00:03:06.120> 50<00:03:06.540> meters<00:03:06.660> but<00:03:07.230> with<00:03:07.560> the

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
and usually at 50 meters but with the

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:10.369 
and usually at 50 meters but with the
heavy<00:03:07.799> but<00:03:08.040> it<00:03:08.220> ends<00:03:08.519> at<00:03:08.640> 75<00:03:09.540> meters<00:03:09.810> and<00:03:10.230> the

00:03:10.369 --> 00:03:10.379 
heavy but it ends at 75 meters and the

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:14.569 
heavy but it ends at 75 meters and the
bullet<00:03:10.680> speed<00:03:10.860> increases<00:03:11.579> from<00:03:12.200> 572<00:03:13.200> 650<00:03:14.160> that

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:14.579 
bullet speed increases from 572 650 that

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:16.220 
bullet speed increases from 572 650 that
means<00:03:14.819> that<00:03:14.940> when<00:03:15.480> you're<00:03:15.629> shooting<00:03:15.780> in<00:03:16.049> long

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
means that when you're shooting in long

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:18.170 
means that when you're shooting in long
range<00:03:16.440> the<00:03:17.069> bullet<00:03:17.370> is<00:03:17.459> going<00:03:17.670> to<00:03:17.760> go<00:03:17.880> there

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
range the bullet is going to go there

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:21.800 
range the bullet is going to go there
faster<00:03:18.660> so<00:03:18.840> you<00:03:18.900> don't<00:03:19.230> have<00:03:19.530> to<00:03:20.130> aim<00:03:20.459> way<00:03:21.389> like

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
faster so you don't have to aim way like

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:24.229 
faster so you don't have to aim way like
at<00:03:22.019> the<00:03:22.139> at<00:03:22.350> the<00:03:22.410> front<00:03:23.040> I<00:03:23.280> like<00:03:23.519> you<00:03:24.000> don't

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
at the at the front I like you don't

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:26.180 
at the at the front I like you don't
have<00:03:24.510> to<00:03:24.810> aim<00:03:24.959> at<00:03:25.139> the<00:03:25.230> position<00:03:25.410> but<00:03:25.950> your

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
have to aim at the position but your

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:28.400 
have to aim at the position but your
enemy<00:03:26.549> will<00:03:26.670> go<00:03:26.880> the<00:03:27.120> bullet<00:03:27.810> will<00:03:27.959> go<00:03:28.170> way

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
enemy will go the bullet will go way

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:31.069 
enemy will go the bullet will go way
faster<00:03:28.769> and<00:03:29.519> let's<00:03:29.910> move<00:03:30.120> on<00:03:30.329> to<00:03:30.480> the<00:03:30.599> time<00:03:30.870> to

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:31.079 
faster and let's move on to the time to

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:33.410 
faster and let's move on to the time to
kill<00:03:31.319> chart<00:03:32.130> and<00:03:32.400> as<00:03:32.579> you<00:03:32.700> see<00:03:32.880> the<00:03:33.000> chart<00:03:33.150> over

the same damage that the heavy barrel
