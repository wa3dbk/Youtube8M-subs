00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:09.540
 to alcohol 

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:12.030
 and good or that is fellow of 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.980
 youtube is the one that I bring you a hack of 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:17.560
 gems for the bogar moon city where 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:19.720
 will perform more limited or infinite 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:21.939
 and well the first thing would be to go to but before 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:23.859
 to start the video I wanted to recommend 

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:27.820
 a channel of a friend is the channel of 

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:29.439
 moshi moshi is a friend that I met in the 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:31.840
 terminal c video about gentes de aragÃ³n 

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:35.890
 city and about other facebook games 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:38.440
 but go through the channel and subscribe and 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:41.860
 they visit all their videos so 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:45.780
 start to take out the others have to 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:47.879
 download this little program 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:51.030
 and left it in the description the inti the 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.890
 download I would upload it to mediafire good 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:57.280
 here we have to paste the data of 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:59.289
 our game is very session and there 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:02.199
 they like us but if 

00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:05.190
 you do not know how to take it out I leave you a 

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:08.740
 video to learn how to get it out is a 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:12.690
 data very easy to get but little 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:12.690
 more the freeware and obvious science 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:21.070
 but what would it be to click on jet 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:23.710
 information 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:27.820
 and wait for the bar to load 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:29.410
 green to load the bar now what 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:31.340
 we serve the last option of which 

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:34.850
 would be x meters 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:37.549
 and here in the 1st south 15 10 a limit 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:41.740
 james that would be unlimited as well 

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:45.500
 up tells us james is a magical gesture 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:48.549
 we shoot the time that tells us two 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.549
 weeks six seconds 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:53.310
 and any mark on the data that we 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:59.470
 he appears from our game he also 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:02:00.820
 I had 262 others and now I have 267 good 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:03.190
 you solved that this time 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:06.420
 finish and I can be video meters 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:06.420
 accumulated a little more gems 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:13.849
 Well, I do not have 200 

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:16.480
 77 gems or 172 and besides now 

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:19.480
 we are simply going to update our 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.480
 site 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:26.609
 but as we are here I have at 260 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:26.609
 gems and I should have 267 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:35.600
 good and Felix observe that he kept 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:38.930
 that middle manager like I do about eight 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:42.950
 more days teaching to give the whole total 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:45.460
 I was going to have it simply will 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:48.520
 will pay an amount 

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:51.570
 smaller what I did but I know what is 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:51.570
 in a good time 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:57.849
 I think he automatically 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:02.120
 approximately 

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:07.630
 will have all the result of law I alone 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:10.930
 always choose how the video does not tell me 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:12.220
 and well that was the video subscribe to me 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:14.590
 dale channel I like 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:17.940
 share it and comment if you have any 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:17.940
 restlessness until the next
