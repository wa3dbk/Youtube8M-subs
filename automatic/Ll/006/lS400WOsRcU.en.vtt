00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
looked like and already Steve got some

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:28.550 
looked like and already Steve got some
pretty<00:00:27.119> key<00:00:27.390> differences<00:00:27.869> here<00:00:28.019> right<00:00:28.260> yeah<00:00:28.529> i

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
pretty key differences here right yeah i

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.500 
pretty key differences here right yeah i
mean<00:00:28.619> everything<00:00:28.980> looks<00:00:29.519> much<00:00:30.300> higher

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
mean everything looks much higher

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.060 
mean everything looks much higher
resolution<00:00:31.109> in<00:00:31.230> that<00:00:31.410> work<00:00:31.650> in<00:00:31.830> progress

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
resolution in that work in progress

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.190 
resolution in that work in progress
gameplay<00:00:32.579> demo<00:00:32.790> look<00:00:33.239> at<00:00:33.329> the<00:00:33.390> light<00:00:33.540> nice

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
gameplay demo look at the light nice

difference in lysing he obviously we've

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:38.690 
difference in lysing he obviously we've
got<00:00:37.530> shadowing<00:00:37.950> coming<00:00:38.190> on<00:00:38.280> for<00:00:38.399> the<00:00:38.489> right

got shadowing coming on for the right
but<00:00:39.420> very<00:00:39.930> very<00:00:40.050> dif<00:00:40.649> as<00:00:40.800> a<00:00:40.829> dynamic<00:00:41.100> lighting

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
but very very dif as a dynamic lighting

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.970 
but very very dif as a dynamic lighting
a<00:00:41.850> little<00:00:41.940> bloom<00:00:42.450> some<00:00:43.320> really<00:00:43.530> cool<00:00:43.649> effects

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980

the<00:00:48.000> judge<00:00:48.149> see<00:00:49.110> in<00:00:49.200> a<00:00:49.260> moment<00:00:49.410> it's<00:00:49.920> it's<00:00:50.370> just

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
the judge see in a moment it's it's just

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.910 
the judge see in a moment it's it's just
not<00:00:51.000> the<00:00:51.239> same<00:00:51.270> at<00:00:51.809> all<00:00:52.110> I<00:00:52.530> mean<00:00:52.770> obviously

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
not the same at all I mean obviously

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.220 
not the same at all I mean obviously
there<00:00:53.460> are<00:00:53.489> minor<00:00:53.820> touches<00:00:54.149> there<00:00:54.510> like<00:00:55.110> with

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
there are minor touches there like with

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.330 
there are minor touches there like with
a<00:00:55.260> handle<00:00:55.559> which<00:00:55.620> now<00:00:55.890> it's<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:56.160> same

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
a handle which now it's the same

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.529 
a handle which now it's the same
explosion<00:00:57.050> similar<00:00:58.050> ripple<00:00:59.420> you<00:01:00.420> know

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
explosion similar ripple you know

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.479 
explosion similar ripple you know
there's<00:01:00.719> no<00:01:00.809> crack<00:01:01.050> on<00:01:01.199> the<00:01:01.289> glass<00:01:01.530> it's<00:01:02.280> very

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
there's no crack on the glass it's very

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.539 
there's no crack on the glass it's very
strange<00:01:03.019> it's<00:01:04.019> very<00:01:04.170> strange<00:01:04.379> it<00:01:04.739> makes<00:01:05.460> a

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
strange it's very strange it makes a

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.300 
strange it's very strange it makes a
question<00:01:05.880> whether<00:01:06.060> they<00:01:06.780> actually<00:01:07.110> built<00:01:07.619> all

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
question whether they actually built all

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.090 
question whether they actually built all
these<00:01:08.549> assets<00:01:09.090> or<00:01:09.710> whether<00:01:10.710> it's<00:01:10.890> just<00:01:10.920> a

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
these assets or whether it's just a

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.440 
these assets or whether it's just a
target<00:01:11.430> render<00:01:11.580> that<00:01:11.670> made<00:01:11.970> to<00:01:12.240> look<00:01:12.390> like

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
target render that made to look like

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.840 
target render that made to look like
gameplay<00:01:13.229> destroy<00:01:13.710> it<00:01:13.920> shouldn't<00:01:14.280> be<00:01:14.340> labeled

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
gameplay destroy it shouldn't be labeled

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.190 
gameplay destroy it shouldn't be labeled
gameplay<00:01:15.299> I<00:01:15.390> mean<00:01:15.540> look<00:01:15.689> at<00:01:15.780> this<00:01:15.930> this<00:01:16.140> is

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
gameplay I mean look at this this is

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.469 
gameplay I mean look at this this is
stunning<00:01:16.500> i<00:01:16.680> mean<00:01:16.799> this<00:01:16.860> is<00:01:16.920> this<00:01:17.040> is<00:01:17.400> a<00:01:17.479> really

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
stunning i mean this is this is a really

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:19.580 
stunning i mean this is this is a really
good<00:01:18.570> example<00:01:18.630> of<00:01:18.990> fact<00:01:19.170> that<00:01:19.259> we<00:01:19.320> have<00:01:19.470> this

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
good example of fact that we have this

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.190 
good example of fact that we have this
very<00:01:20.369> you<00:01:21.000> know<00:01:21.060> excellent<00:01:21.630> dynamic<00:01:21.990> lighting

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
very you know excellent dynamic lighting

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.590 
very you know excellent dynamic lighting
and<00:01:22.590> it's<00:01:23.130> just<00:01:23.310> not<00:01:23.460> here<00:01:23.670> there<00:01:23.939> is<00:01:24.090> there<00:01:24.570> is

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
and it's just not here there is there is

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:25.580 
and it's just not here there is there is
a<00:01:24.720> light<00:01:24.930> hanging<00:01:25.140> down<00:01:25.350> from<00:01:25.380> the<00:01:25.500> ceiling

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
a light hanging down from the ceiling

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.530 
a light hanging down from the ceiling
but<00:01:25.890> there's<00:01:26.250> no<00:01:26.400> dynamic<00:01:26.610> lighting<00:01:26.970> yeah<00:01:27.360> the

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
but there's no dynamic lighting yeah the

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.899 
but there's no dynamic lighting yeah the
difference<00:01:27.990> is<00:01:28.170> is<00:01:28.380> you<00:01:29.009> know<00:01:29.130> 19<00:01:29.460> days<00:01:29.640> now

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
difference is is you know 19 days now

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.210 
difference is is you know 19 days now
that<00:01:30.240> so<00:01:30.509> much<00:01:30.600> more<00:01:30.750> atmosphere<00:01:31.290> in<00:01:31.409> this<00:01:31.560> the

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
that so much more atmosphere in this the

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.210 
that so much more atmosphere in this the
dynamically<00:01:32.729> lit<00:01:32.939> environment<00:01:33.890> and<00:01:34.890> although

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
dynamically lit environment and although

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.140 
dynamically lit environment and although
there<00:01:35.340> is<00:01:35.460> you<00:01:35.640> know<00:01:35.700> some<00:01:35.939> lighting

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
there is you know some lighting

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.520

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
most stunning comparison we have here

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.300 
most stunning comparison we have here

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
game yeah obviously there's no dude

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.030 
game yeah obviously there's no dude
there<00:01:45.810> but<00:01:45.960> doesn't<00:01:46.170> matter<00:01:46.290> yeah<00:01:46.649> like<00:01:46.860> but

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
let's look at this look at the dynamic

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.810 
let's look at this look at the dynamic
lighting<00:01:48.890> look<00:01:49.890> at<00:01:50.040> that<00:01:50.159> it<00:01:50.340> looks<00:01:50.369> like<00:01:50.670> an

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
lighting look at that it looks like an

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.310 
lighting look at that it looks like an
n64<00:01:51.000> game<00:01:51.509> it<00:01:51.780> does<00:01:51.899> literally<00:01:52.200> look<00:01:52.290> like

trigger which I'm not saying they are we
don't<00:03:01.590> know<00:03:01.739> but<00:03:02.010> and<00:03:02.519> you<00:03:02.940> you<00:03:03.450> can't<00:03:03.799> compare

00:03:04.789 --> 00:03:04.799 
don't know but and you you can't compare

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:06.620 
don't know but and you you can't compare
the<00:03:04.830> two<00:03:04.980> right<00:03:05.400> now<00:03:05.430> it's<00:03:05.580> as<00:03:06.120> I<00:03:06.209> mean<00:03:06.420> senior

stuff<00:03:06.750> like<00:03:06.900> animation<00:03:07.200> appears<00:03:07.500> to<00:03:07.739> be

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
stuff like animation appears to be

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:10.460 
stuff like animation appears to be
custom<00:03:08.430> and<00:03:08.700> Foley's<00:03:09.269> descend<00:03:09.720> ups<00:03:09.870> whereas

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
custom and Foley's descend ups whereas

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:12.380 
custom and Foley's descend ups whereas
in<00:03:10.590> the<00:03:10.950> the<00:03:11.250> final<00:03:11.519> game<00:03:11.640> it's<00:03:12.000> clearly<00:03:12.299> not

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
in the the final game it's clearly not

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:13.640 
in the the final game it's clearly not
and<00:03:12.720> the<00:03:12.780> way<00:03:12.900> that<00:03:13.019> there's<00:03:13.170> any<00:03:13.260> more<00:03:13.410> move

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
and the way that there's any more move

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:15.440 
and the way that there's any more move
is<00:03:13.799> just<00:03:14.010> entirely<00:03:14.340> different<00:03:14.790> this<00:03:15.299> is

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
is just entirely different this is

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:16.520 
is just entirely different this is
stunning<00:03:15.660> I<00:03:15.870> mean<00:03:16.049> look<00:03:16.110> at<00:03:16.200> this<00:03:16.319> we<00:03:16.500> just

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
seen that cool explosion and moved into

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.120 
seen that cool explosion and moved into
the<00:03:18.180> fire<00:03:18.329> this<00:03:18.540> is<00:03:18.630> what<00:03:18.750> it<00:03:18.810> looks<00:03:18.930> like<00:03:19.130> wait

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 
the fire this is what it looks like wait

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:22.970 
the fire this is what it looks like wait
for<00:03:20.310> it<00:03:20.340> wait<00:03:20.489> for<00:03:20.609> it<00:03:21.049> here<00:03:22.049> it<00:03:22.140> comes<00:03:22.320> oh<00:03:22.500> I

actually<00:03:25.290> again<00:03:25.500> I'll<00:03:25.650> show<00:03:25.799> these<00:03:25.920> in<00:03:26.040> slow

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
actually again I'll show these in slow

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.310 
actually again I'll show these in slow
motion<00:03:26.400> just<00:03:26.670> so<00:03:26.790> you<00:03:26.850> can<00:03:26.970> really<00:03:27.209> just<00:03:28.079> soak

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:28.320 
motion just so you can really just soak

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:30.140 
motion just so you can really just soak
this<00:03:28.530> up<00:03:28.739> but<00:03:28.859> look<00:03:29.010> at<00:03:29.130> the<00:03:29.220> fires<00:03:29.519> I<00:03:29.880> mean

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
this up but look at the fires I mean

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:32.090 
this up but look at the fires I mean
that<00:03:30.299> they<00:03:30.420> look<00:03:30.570> like<00:03:30.690> 2d<00:03:30.989> sprites<00:03:31.350> and<00:03:31.680> later

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:32.100 
that they look like 2d sprites and later

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:33.949 
that they look like 2d sprites and later
no<00:03:32.310> motion<00:03:32.640> it<00:03:32.730> doesn't<00:03:33.030> it<00:03:33.299> doesn't<00:03:33.329> jump<00:03:33.720> to

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 
no motion it doesn't it doesn't jump to

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:35.930 
no motion it doesn't it doesn't jump to
the<00:03:34.290> crate<00:03:34.590> there<00:03:34.829> or<00:03:35.160> anything<00:03:35.459> like<00:03:35.489> that<00:03:35.609> I

the crate there or anything like that I
mean<00:03:36.120> I<00:03:36.359> mean<00:03:36.690> things<00:03:37.260> like<00:03:37.350> that<00:03:37.530> the<00:03:37.680> changes

in scripting &amp; animation that's that's

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:41.300 
in scripting &amp; animation that's that's
understandable<00:03:40.380> these<00:03:40.950> things<00:03:41.130> always

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
understandable these things always

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.099 
understandable these things always
happen<00:03:41.640> you<00:03:42.180> know<00:03:42.269> we<00:03:42.540> understand<00:03:42.900> that<00:03:42.930> game

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:43.109 
happen you know we understand that game

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:45.020 
happen you know we understand that game
development<00:03:43.410> is<00:03:43.590> in<00:03:43.709> flux<00:03:44.010> but<00:03:44.280> these<00:03:44.430> these

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
development is in flux but these these

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:47.240 
development is in flux but these these
were<00:03:45.209> all<00:03:45.390> marks<00:03:45.750> is<00:03:45.900> working<00:03:46.350> progress<00:03:46.620> when

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
were all marks is working progress when

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:48.800 
were all marks is working progress when
they<00:03:47.340> were<00:03:47.400> shown<00:03:47.609> and<00:03:48.180> when<00:03:48.329> you<00:03:48.420> see<00:03:48.570> some<00:03:48.720> it

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
they were shown and when you see some it

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:50.449 
they were shown and when you see some it
work<00:03:49.019> in<00:03:49.170> progress<00:03:49.380> you<00:03:49.739> don't<00:03:49.920> expect<00:03:50.040> it<00:03:50.430> to

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 
work in progress you don't expect it to

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:52.580 
work in progress you don't expect it to
then<00:03:50.700> get<00:03:50.880> worse<00:03:51.239> so<00:03:51.720> I<00:03:52.049> mean<00:03:52.320> even<00:03:52.410> the

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
then get worse so I mean even the

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:53.930 
then get worse so I mean even the
possibility<00:03:52.709> they<00:03:53.310> were<00:03:53.400> just<00:03:53.549> running<00:03:53.700> this

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940 
possibility they were just running this

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:56.420 
possibility they were just running this
on<00:03:54.090> a<00:03:54.120> high<00:03:54.329> end<00:03:54.570> pc<00:03:54.810> a<00:03:55.290> really<00:03:56.040> high<00:03:56.160> end<00:03:56.280> pc

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430 
on a high end pc a really high end pc

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:58.910 
on a high end pc a really high end pc
and<00:03:56.850> it<00:03:56.910> you<00:03:57.000> know<00:03:57.090> we'd<00:03:57.989> understand<00:03:58.440> if<00:03:58.590> this

00:03:58.910 --> 00:03:58.920 
and it you know we'd understand if this

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:00.650 
and it you know we'd understand if this
was<00:03:59.100> somehow<00:03:59.280> it<00:03:59.459> ain<00:03:59.880> nabol<00:04:00.120> within<00:04:00.420> the<00:04:00.510> game

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:00.660 
was somehow it ain nabol within the game

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:02.960 
was somehow it ain nabol within the game
but<00:04:00.840> obviously<00:04:00.900> this<00:04:01.380> is<00:04:01.590> you<00:04:02.489> know<00:04:02.609> when

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 
but obviously this is you know when

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:04.039 
but obviously this is you know when
you're<00:04:03.150> playing<00:04:03.299> the<00:04:03.420> game<00:04:03.450> on<00:04:03.690> the<00:04:03.959> very

00:04:04.039 --> 00:04:04.049 
you're playing the game on the very

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:06.410 
you're playing the game on the very
highest<00:04:04.440> settings<00:04:04.980> this<00:04:05.640> is<00:04:05.819> I<00:04:05.850> mean<00:04:05.940> it<00:04:06.239> just

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:06.420 
highest settings this is I mean it just

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:08.210 
highest settings this is I mean it just
doesn't<00:04:06.720> look<00:04:06.810> like<00:04:07.019> this<00:04:07.230> and<00:04:07.739> that's<00:04:08.160> the

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220 
doesn't look like this and that's the

strain<00:04:25.530> it<00:04:25.800> looks<00:04:25.980> like<00:04:26.160> this<00:04:26.310> yeah<00:04:26.730> it<00:04:27.120> just

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180 
strain it looks like this yeah it just

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:29.000 
strain it looks like this yeah it just
looks<00:04:27.570> like<00:04:27.660> it<00:04:27.780> looks<00:04:28.020> very<00:04:28.140> flat<00:04:28.410> everything

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:29.010 
looks like it looks very flat everything

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:32.240 
looks like it looks very flat everything
so<00:04:29.190> flat<00:04:29.490> the<00:04:29.880> lighting<00:04:30.360> is<00:04:30.560> as<00:04:31.560> you<00:04:31.710> say<00:04:31.890> just

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:32.250 
so flat the lighting is as you say just

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:34.520 
so flat the lighting is as you say just
very<00:04:32.550> geometrically<00:04:33.390> it's<00:04:33.660> all<00:04:33.810> the<00:04:33.900> same<00:04:34.050> but

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:34.530 
very geometrically it's all the same but

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:36.320 
very geometrically it's all the same but
that's<00:04:34.770> kinda<00:04:35.460> where<00:04:35.580> the<00:04:35.670> comparisons<00:04:36.150> end

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:36.330 
that's kinda where the comparisons end

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:38.750 
that's kinda where the comparisons end
Hadley's<00:04:36.930> hope<00:04:37.140> here<00:04:37.410> again<00:04:37.860> and<00:04:38.160> this<00:04:38.610> is

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:38.760 
Hadley's hope here again and this is

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:40.040 
Hadley's hope here again and this is
disappointing<00:04:38.910> because<00:04:39.330> the<00:04:39.540> fact<00:04:39.690> obviously

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.050 
disappointing because the fact obviously

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:41.720 
disappointing because the fact obviously
they<00:04:40.140> have<00:04:40.290> sold<00:04:40.530> this<00:04:40.650> game<00:04:40.890> very<00:04:40.920> heavily<00:04:41.550> on

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:41.730 
they have sold this game very heavily on

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:43.850 
they have sold this game very heavily on
the<00:04:41.820> fact<00:04:42.000> that<00:04:42.060> it's<00:04:42.270> this<00:04:42.620> recreation<00:04:43.620> of

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:43.860 
the fact that it's this recreation of

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:45.650 
the fact that it's this recreation of
the<00:04:43.920> world<00:04:44.220> and<00:04:44.730> looking<00:04:45.000> at<00:04:45.090> the<00:04:45.150> window<00:04:45.420> here

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:45.660 
the world and looking at the window here

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:48.080 
the world and looking at the window here
at<00:04:45.840> that<00:04:46.350> the<00:04:46.560> planet<00:04:46.890> it's<00:04:47.070> it's<00:04:47.820> pretty

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:53.400 
does it actually look like in the game

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:56.240 
does it actually look like in the game
was<00:04:53.820> it<00:04:53.940> actually<00:04:54.360> look<00:04:54.510> like<00:04:54.600> well<00:04:55.250> you're

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:10.440 
lighting in this room is fantastic this

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:13.390 
lighting in this room is fantastic this
looks<00:05:11.250> and<00:05:11.520> feels<00:05:11.790> like<00:05:12.240> an<00:05:12.360> alien's<00:05:12.690> game

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:13.400 
looks and feels like an alien's game

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:15.740 
looks and feels like an alien's game
yeah<00:05:14.400> it's<00:05:14.520> got<00:05:14.640> the<00:05:14.760> same<00:05:14.910> palette

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:15.750 
yeah it's got the same palette

yeah it's got the same palette
everything<00:05:16.290> yeah<00:05:16.440> that's<00:05:16.680> that's<00:05:16.830> exactly

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:17.280 
everything yeah that's that's exactly

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:19.640 
everything yeah that's that's exactly
exactly<00:05:17.760> right<00:05:18.090> i<00:05:18.150> mean<00:05:18.270> the<00:05:18.960> kind<00:05:19.290> of<00:05:19.380> hues

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:19.650 
exactly right i mean the kind of hues

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:22.280 
exactly right i mean the kind of hues
are<00:05:19.680> all<00:05:19.980> all<00:05:20.310> on<00:05:20.700> point<00:05:21.000> and<00:05:21.240> this<00:05:21.900> one<00:05:22.140> this

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:22.290 
are all all on point and this one this

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:23.840 
are all all on point and this one this
one<00:05:22.440> looks<00:05:22.620> like<00:05:22.650> it's<00:05:23.190> how<00:05:23.310> the<00:05:23.370> contrast

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:23.850 
one looks like it's how the contrast

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:25.340 
one looks like it's how the contrast
really<00:05:24.240> jacked<00:05:24.480> up<00:05:24.690> where<00:05:25.020> it's<00:05:25.140> in

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:25.350 
really jacked up where it's in

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:26.840 
really jacked up where it's in
comparison<00:05:25.830> with<00:05:25.860> what<00:05:25.980> you<00:05:26.160> see<00:05:26.310> now<00:05:26.490> and

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:26.850 
comparison with what you see now and

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:28.580 
comparison with what you see now and
stuff<00:05:27.240> like<00:05:27.330> the<00:05:27.480> aliens<00:05:27.840> like<00:05:27.990> crawling<00:05:28.440> in

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:28.590 
stuff like the aliens like crawling in

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:31.760 
stuff like the aliens like crawling in
and<00:05:28.680> out<00:05:28.770> of<00:05:29.010> the<00:05:29.250> you<00:05:30.030> know<00:05:30.410> the<00:05:31.410> ceiling

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:31.770 
and out of the you know the ceiling

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:33.950 
and out of the you know the ceiling
there<00:05:31.950> it's<00:05:32.250> just<00:05:32.490> you<00:05:32.970> don't<00:05:33.030> and<00:05:33.390> the<00:05:33.780> kind

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:33.960 
there it's just you don't and the kind

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:36.290 
there it's just you don't and the kind
of<00:05:33.990> the<00:05:34.320> effects<00:05:34.560> on<00:05:34.680> the<00:05:34.770> bullets<00:05:35.100> as<00:05:35.250> well<00:05:35.430> it

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:36.300 
of the effects on the bullets as well it

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:37.640 
of the effects on the bullets as well it
just<00:05:36.540> is<00:05:36.690> strange<00:05:37.020> you<00:05:37.200> just<00:05:37.350> don't<00:05:37.500> think

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:37.650 
just is strange you just don't think

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:39.050 
just is strange you just don't think
what<00:05:37.770> happens<00:05:38.190> well<00:05:38.370> this<00:05:38.460> technology<00:05:38.880> the

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:40.290 
fact that it's not including the pc

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:42.380 
fact that it's not including the pc
version<00:05:40.550> what<00:05:41.550> happened<00:05:41.880> to<00:05:41.970> all<00:05:42.030> this<00:05:42.180> stuff

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:42.390 
version what happened to all this stuff

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:44.210 
version what happened to all this stuff
and<00:05:42.630> did<00:05:42.870> it<00:05:42.990> did<00:05:43.260> it<00:05:43.290> exists<00:05:43.680> in<00:05:43.830> the<00:05:43.890> firming

I mean yeah we set up a turret there's
just<00:06:15.480> not<00:06:15.630> any<00:06:15.690> aid<00:06:15.960> is<00:06:16.230> this<00:06:16.380> that<00:06:16.800> whole<00:06:17.070> bit

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:17.310 
just not any aid is this that whole bit

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:18.710 
just not any aid is this that whole bit
just<00:06:17.490> wasn't<00:06:17.760> in<00:06:17.820> the<00:06:17.880> game<00:06:17.970> but<00:06:18.450> these<00:06:18.600> aren't

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:18.720

Lee<00:06:18.870> the<00:06:18.930> biggest<00:06:19.140> problems<00:06:19.380> look<00:06:19.470> at<00:06:19.560> the

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:19.650 
Lee the biggest problems look at the

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:22.520 
Lee the biggest problems look at the
place<00:06:19.800> but<00:06:20.160> those<00:06:20.820> enemies<00:06:21.120> have<00:06:21.320> NPCs<00:06:22.320> have

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:22.530 
place but those enemies have NPCs have

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:24.500 
place but those enemies have NPCs have
collision<00:06:23.250> outside<00:06:23.670> of<00:06:23.850> those<00:06:23.970> things<00:06:24.210> so

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:24.510 
collision outside of those things so

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:26.420 
collision outside of those things so
it's<00:06:24.990> strange<00:06:25.320> of<00:06:25.770> course<00:06:25.950> it<00:06:26.070> could<00:06:26.190> be<00:06:26.280> worse

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:26.430 
it's strange of course it could be worse

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:27.920 
it's strange of course it could be worse
you<00:06:26.460> could<00:06:26.610> have<00:06:26.850> bought<00:06:26.970> the<00:06:27.180> xbox<00:06:27.270> 360

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:27.930 
you could have bought the xbox 360

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:29.780 
you could have bought the xbox 360
version<00:06:27.990> which<00:06:28.410> is<00:06:28.560> incredibly<00:06:29.190> jaggi<00:06:29.550> and

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:29.790 
version which is incredibly jaggi and

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:30.750 
version which is incredibly jaggi and
very<00:06:30.240> ugly

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:30.760 
very ugly

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:31.920 
very ugly
we<00:06:31.090> don't<00:06:31.150> really<00:06:31.330> know<00:06:31.450> what's<00:06:31.600> happened<00:06:31.870> to

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:31.930 
we don't really know what's happened to

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:33.480 
we don't really know what's happened to
this<00:06:31.990> game<00:06:32.170> in<00:06:32.290> development<00:06:32.380> that<00:06:33.100> something

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:33.490 
this game in development that something

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:34.800 
this game in development that something
is<00:06:33.610> obviously<00:06:33.700> gone<00:06:34.000> horribly<00:06:34.270> wrong<00:06:34.420> and<00:06:34.600> it

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:34.810 
is obviously gone horribly wrong and it

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:39.600 
is obviously gone horribly wrong and it
feels<00:06:35.020> like<00:06:35.200> there's<00:06:35.380> only<00:06:35.470> one<00:06:35.830> good<00:06:36.220> way<00:06:36.520> out

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:39.610 

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:41.669
