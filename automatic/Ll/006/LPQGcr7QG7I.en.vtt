00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:47.920 
funny after a little while it would just

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:50.540 
funny after a little while it would just
feel<00:03:48.220> out<00:03:48.460> of<00:03:48.520> place<00:03:48.810> again<00:03:49.810> it<00:03:50.050> would<00:03:50.260> degrade

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:50.550 
feel out of place again it would degrade
