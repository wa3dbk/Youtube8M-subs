00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:02.850 
all right we are here today having a

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.740 
all right we are here today having a
look<00:00:03.060> at<00:00:03.240> a<00:00:03.449> crop<00:00:03.780> of<00:00:04.790> volos<00:00:05.790> this<00:00:06.330> is<00:00:06.509> new

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750 
look at a crop of volos this is new

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.709 
look at a crop of volos this is new
variety<00:00:07.200> of<00:00:07.290> white<00:00:07.589> Lupin<00:00:08.389> it's<00:00:09.389> one<00:00:09.570> that

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
variety of white Lupin it's one that

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.400 
variety of white Lupin it's one that
we're<00:00:09.929> multiplying<00:00:10.260> up<00:00:10.830> to<00:00:11.639> join<00:00:12.269> the<00:00:13.170> stay

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
we're multiplying up to join the stay

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.400 
we're multiplying up to join the stay
belong<00:00:13.799> with<00:00:14.070> dieter<00:00:14.580> and<00:00:15.570> if<00:00:15.870> we<00:00:15.960> just<00:00:15.990> have<00:00:16.379> a

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
belong with dieter and if we just have a

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.340 
belong with dieter and if we just have a
little<00:00:16.590> pan<00:00:16.980> across<00:00:17.430> the<00:00:17.699> field<00:00:17.940> here<00:00:18.350> you

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
little pan across the field here you

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:29.890 
little pan across the field here you
will<00:00:19.500> see<00:00:19.770> a<00:00:20.900> tall<00:00:24.890> strong<00:00:25.890> growing<00:00:26.189> plant

possibility of seed borne disease this

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:26.490 
possibility of seed borne disease this
is<00:02:21.910> good<00:02:22.290> practice<00:02:24.270> good<00:02:25.270> seed<00:02:26.050> production

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
is good practice good seed production

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:34.789 
is good practice good seed production
practice

00:02:34.789 --> 00:02:34.799 

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:38.399 

it<00:02:35.799> has<00:02:36.099> just<00:02:36.400> finished<00:02:36.640> flowering<00:02:37.450> and<00:02:38.260> it

00:02:38.399 --> 00:02:38.409 
it has just finished flowering and it

00:02:38.409 --> 00:02:41.970 
it has just finished flowering and it
has<00:02:38.530> no<00:02:38.739> in<00:02:39.159> its<00:02:39.370> pod<00:02:39.700> filling<00:02:40.299> fees<00:02:40.799> here<00:02:41.799> you

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
has no in its pod filling fees here you

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:45.020 
has no in its pod filling fees here you
have<00:02:42.220> the<00:02:42.970> bottom<00:02:43.420> cluster<00:02:43.959> of<00:02:44.079> pods<00:02:44.379> here

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
have the bottom cluster of pods here

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.059 
have the bottom cluster of pods here
these<00:02:46.030> are<00:02:46.269> known<00:02:46.420> as<00:02:46.450> the<00:02:46.689> first<00:02:47.170> stage<00:02:47.590> pods

00:02:48.059 --> 00:02:48.069 
these are known as the first stage pods

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:53.550 
these are known as the first stage pods
and<00:02:48.970> you<00:02:49.810> have<00:02:49.959> the<00:02:50.140> three<00:02:50.170> branches<00:02:52.530> to<00:02:53.530> the

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
and you have the three branches to the

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.259 
and you have the three branches to the
second<00:02:54.129> stage<00:02:54.400> clusters<00:02:55.090> which<00:02:55.329> I<00:02:55.540> hear<00:02:56.010> yeah

00:02:57.259 --> 00:02:57.269 
second stage clusters which I hear yeah

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:02.430 
second stage clusters which I hear yeah
yeah<00:02:58.620> and<00:02:59.620> also<00:03:00.040> we<00:03:00.489> have<00:03:00.700> some<00:03:01.150> third<00:03:02.019> stage

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440 
yeah and also we have some third stage

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:09.180 
yeah and also we have some third stage
clustering<00:03:03.280> here<00:03:03.549> yeah<00:03:07.530> so<00:03:08.530> this<00:03:08.680> is<00:03:08.890> a<00:03:08.920> fun

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:09.190 
clustering here yeah so this is a fun

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:13.110 
clustering here yeah so this is a fun
example<00:03:09.879> of<00:03:09.970> a<00:03:10.090> plant<00:03:11.280> these<00:03:12.280> ports<00:03:12.819> will

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
example of a plant these ports will

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.509 
example of a plant these ports will
continue<00:03:13.840> to<00:03:14.019> fill<00:03:14.349> in<00:03:14.620> the<00:03:14.709> next<00:03:14.859> three<00:03:15.280> to

00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:15.519 
continue to fill in the next three to

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:20.250 
continue to fill in the next three to
four<00:03:15.730> weeks<00:03:16.060> and<00:03:16.900> they<00:03:17.680> will<00:03:18.659> produce<00:03:19.659> a<00:03:20.019> lot

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260 
four weeks and they will produce a lot

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.129 
four weeks and they will produce a lot
of<00:03:20.560> high-quality<00:03:20.909> protein<00:03:21.909> when<00:03:22.690> this<00:03:22.900> crop

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:23.139 
of high-quality protein when this crop

00:03:23.139 --> 00:03:27.599 
of high-quality protein when this crop
is<00:03:23.170> harvested<00:03:24.629> just<00:03:25.629> a<00:03:25.750> quick<00:03:25.989> word<00:03:26.230> on<00:03:26.709> crop

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:27.609 
is harvested just a quick word on crop

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:32.430 
is harvested just a quick word on crop
protection<00:03:28.409> this<00:03:29.409> crop<00:03:29.739> was<00:03:30.040> sown<00:03:31.079> at<00:03:32.079> the<00:03:32.260> end

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 
protection this crop was sown at the end

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:38.210 
protection this crop was sown at the end
of<00:03:32.739> March<00:03:33.599> it<00:03:34.599> had<00:03:35.220> one<00:03:36.220> application<00:03:37.180> with<00:03:38.109> a

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
of March it had one application with a

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:41.670 
of March it had one application with a
pre-emergent<00:03:39.269> herbicide<00:03:40.269> this<00:03:41.049> has<00:03:41.260> given<00:03:41.440> us

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:41.680 
pre-emergent herbicide this has given us

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:47.599 
pre-emergent herbicide this has given us
good<00:03:42.010> weed<00:03:42.280> control<00:03:43.709> in<00:03:44.709> one<00:03:45.160> area<00:03:45.519> we<00:03:46.209> had

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:47.609 
good weed control in one area we had

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:51.240 
good weed control in one area we had
also<00:03:48.609> weed<00:03:49.000> problems<00:03:49.569> we<00:03:50.290> have<00:03:50.530> also<00:03:50.739> come

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:51.250 
also weed problems we have also come

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:54.479 
also weed problems we have also come
with<00:03:51.280> a<00:03:51.519> post<00:03:51.940> emergence<00:03:53.190> probably<00:03:54.190> weed
