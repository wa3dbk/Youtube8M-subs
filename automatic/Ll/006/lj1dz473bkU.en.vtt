00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:53.090 
guessing to try to wrap it spin away my
stealth<00:01:50.340> rocks<00:01:50.610> and<00:01:51.000> he<00:01:51.060> does<00:01:51.320> so<00:01:52.320> I'm<00:01:52.979> just

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
stealth rocks and he does so I'm just

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.560 
stealth rocks and he does so I'm just
going<00:01:53.250> to<00:01:53.340> surf<00:01:53.640> it<00:01:53.850> because<00:01:54.149> that's<00:01:54.240> super

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
going to surf it because that's super

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.120 
going to surf it because that's super
effective<00:01:54.869> and<00:01:55.290> I<00:01:55.350> can<00:01:55.470> always<00:01:55.590> step<00:01:55.829> stealth

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
effective and I can always step stealth

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.240 
effective and I can always step stealth
rocks<00:01:56.399> again<00:01:56.670> later<00:01:56.880> and<00:01:57.829> donphan<00:01:58.829> takes<00:01:59.130> a

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
rocks again later and donphan takes a

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.550 
rocks again later and donphan takes a
huge<00:01:59.579> blow<00:01:59.850> from<00:02:00.030> that<00:02:00.299> but<00:02:00.659> um<00:02:00.899> he<00:02:01.200> survives

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
huge blow from that but um he survives

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.569 
huge blow from that but um he survives
with<00:02:02.280> a<00:02:02.310> few<00:02:02.670> hit<00:02:02.790> points<00:02:03.119> left<00:02:03.180> and<00:02:04.579> he

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
with a few hit points left and he

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:08.660 
with a few hit points left and he
withdraws<00:02:06.000> into<00:02:06.439> bliss<00:02:07.439> because<00:02:07.950> bliss<00:02:08.520> is

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
withdraws into bliss because bliss is

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.430 
withdraws into bliss because bliss is
homosexual<00:02:09.300> and<00:02:09.479> such<00:02:09.720> and<00:02:10.020> I<00:02:10.440> go<00:02:10.649> on<00:02:10.770> oxy<00:02:11.220> and

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
and that's pretty nice I don't know if

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:43.819 
and that's pretty nice I don't know if
this<00:02:42.180> is<00:02:42.209> a<00:02:42.329> physical<00:02:42.719> a<00:02:42.810> special<00:02:43.200> to<00:02:43.349> kiss<00:02:43.620> yet

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:43.829 
this is a physical a special to kiss yet

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:46.640 
this is a physical a special to kiss yet
but<00:02:44.069> i<00:02:44.129> guess<00:02:44.489> i'm<00:02:44.609> going<00:02:44.639> to<00:02:44.849> find<00:02:45.120> out<00:02:45.329> and<00:02:45.659> i

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
but i guess i'm going to find out and i

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:47.599 
but i guess i'm going to find out and i
decide<00:02:46.980> to<00:02:47.069> go<00:02:47.129> over<00:02:47.220> to<00:02:47.250> the<00:02:47.340> sucker<00:02:47.459> punch

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:47.609 
decide to go over to the sucker punch

00:02:47.609 --> 00:02:50.360 
decide to go over to the sucker punch
but<00:02:48.299> he<00:02:48.569> had<00:02:48.659> also<00:02:48.930> asked<00:02:49.290> rick<00:02:49.500> so<00:02:49.769> Sid<00:02:50.099> really

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
but he had also asked rick so Sid really

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.420 
but he had also asked rick so Sid really
likes<00:02:50.700> trick<00:02:51.060> and<00:02:51.379> he<00:02:52.379> kissed<00:02:52.560> spirito<00:02:53.280> much

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
likes trick and he kissed spirito much

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.970 
likes trick and he kissed spirito much
choice<00:02:53.909> band<00:02:54.329> which<00:02:54.689> I<00:02:54.900> guess<00:02:55.109> isn't<00:02:55.379> that<00:02:55.650> bad

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
choice band which I guess isn't that bad

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.740 
choice band which I guess isn't that bad
because<00:02:56.849> sucker<00:02:57.359> punch<00:02:57.629> is<00:02:57.840> physical<00:02:58.409> but<00:02:58.919> um

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750 
because sucker punch is physical but um

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:03.830 
because sucker punch is physical but um
it's<00:03:00.750> not<00:03:00.870> really<00:03:01.260> you<00:03:01.680> know<00:03:01.709> that<00:03:02.430> great<00:03:02.909> on<00:03:03.180> a

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
it's not really you know that great on a

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.409 
it's not really you know that great on a
wall<00:03:04.169> so<00:03:04.799> he<00:03:05.189> goes<00:03:05.310> into<00:03:05.489> a<00:03:05.579> dragonite<00:03:06.060> and<00:03:06.269> I

00:03:06.409 --> 00:03:06.419 
wall so he goes into a dragonite and I

00:03:06.419 --> 00:03:09.259 
wall so he goes into a dragonite and I
go<00:03:06.599> into<00:03:06.750> a<00:03:06.840> gastro<00:03:07.290> Don<00:03:07.439> and<00:03:07.969> he's<00:03:08.969> really

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:09.269 
go into a gastro Don and he's really

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:11.539 
go into a gastro Don and he's really
hoping<00:03:09.719> that<00:03:09.780> I<00:03:09.900> don't<00:03:09.959> have<00:03:10.230> ice<00:03:10.409> beam<00:03:10.709> but

00:03:11.539 --> 00:03:11.549 
hoping that I don't have ice beam but

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:15.589 
hoping that I don't have ice beam but
guess<00:03:12.000> what<00:03:12.239> i<00:03:12.510> do<00:03:13.230> have<00:03:13.590> ice<00:03:13.829> beam<00:03:14.159> so<00:03:14.760> he's

00:03:15.589 --> 00:03:15.599 
guess what i do have ice beam so he's

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:18.589 
guess what i do have ice beam so he's
he's<00:03:16.019> trying<00:03:16.379> to<00:03:16.500> think<00:03:16.799> we're<00:03:17.790> like<00:03:17.970> he's

00:03:18.589 --> 00:03:18.599 
he's trying to think we're like he's

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:20.479 
he's trying to think we're like he's
typing<00:03:19.049> me<00:03:19.260> i<00:03:19.470> think<00:03:19.829> this<00:03:19.919> is<00:03:19.979> the<00:03:20.099> therapy

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:20.489 
typing me i think this is the therapy

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:22.849 
typing me i think this is the therapy
chatter<00:03:20.699> another<00:03:21.000> call<00:03:21.569> this<00:03:21.780> moment<00:03:22.260> but

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:22.859 
chatter another call this moment but

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:24.229 
chatter another call this moment but
yeah<00:03:23.099> he<00:03:23.280> goes<00:03:23.400> with<00:03:23.459> a<00:03:23.609> heel<00:03:23.790> Bell<00:03:24.030> to<00:03:24.209> his

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
yeah he goes with a heel Bell to his

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:26.899 
yeah he goes with a heel Bell to his
team<00:03:24.690> but<00:03:25.019> I<00:03:25.049> do<00:03:25.199> have<00:03:25.530> the<00:03:25.680> ice<00:03:25.829> beam<00:03:26.159> so

00:03:26.899 --> 00:03:26.909 
team but I do have the ice beam so

00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:28.219 
team but I do have the ice beam so
that's<00:03:27.060> going<00:03:27.180> to<00:03:27.359> take<00:03:27.449> down<00:03:27.629> a<00:03:27.690> dragonite

00:03:28.219 --> 00:03:28.229 
that's going to take down a dragonite

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:30.439 
that's going to take down a dragonite
and<00:03:28.470> that's<00:03:28.590> pretty<00:03:28.889> nice<00:03:29.069> so<00:03:29.939> I<00:03:29.970> take<00:03:30.239> down<00:03:30.419> a

00:03:30.439 --> 00:03:30.449 
and that's pretty nice so I take down a

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:34.099 
and that's pretty nice so I take down a
dragonite<00:03:30.930> but<00:03:31.290> he<00:03:31.500> gets<00:03:31.680> a<00:03:31.949> team<00:03:32.579> heal<00:03:32.909> so<00:03:33.689> I

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:34.109 
dragonite but he gets a team heal so I

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:36.259 
dragonite but he gets a team heal so I
guess<00:03:34.739> that's<00:03:34.919> kind<00:03:35.310> of<00:03:35.370> random<00:03:35.579> but<00:03:36.120> um

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:36.269 
guess that's kind of random but um

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:38.750 
guess that's kind of random but um
anyway<00:03:36.750> he<00:03:36.900> goes<00:03:37.049> into<00:03:37.199> a<00:03:37.290> blizzy<00:03:37.620> and<00:03:37.859> the

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
anyway he goes into a blizzy and the

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.080 
anyway he goes into a blizzy and the
gastro<00:03:39.180> Don<00:03:39.329> is<00:03:39.750> not<00:03:40.709> very<00:03:41.189> good<00:03:41.760> against

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
gastro Don is not very good against

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:43.610 
gastro Don is not very good against
