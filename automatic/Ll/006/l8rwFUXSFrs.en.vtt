00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.150 
your bullets off quicker and after
you're<00:00:24.960> sprinting<00:00:25.230> which<00:00:25.560> you'll<00:00:25.740> do<00:00:25.859> a<00:00:25.890> lot

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
you're sprinting which you'll do a lot

you're sprinting which you'll do a lot
on<00:00:26.250> these<00:00:26.369> maps<00:00:26.640> because<00:00:26.849> in<00:00:27.240> goes<00:00:27.480> the<00:00:27.510> maps

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
on these maps because in goes the maps

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.359 
on these maps because in goes the maps
app<00:00:28.080> so<00:00:28.260> you<00:00:28.349> massive<00:00:28.710> so<00:00:28.859> you<00:00:28.920> spend<00:00:29.160> a<00:00:29.189> lot<00:00:29.340> of

app so you massive so you spend a lot of
time<00:00:29.460> running<00:00:30.090> and<00:00:30.330> sprinting<00:00:30.390> around<00:00:30.810> the

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
time running and sprinting around the

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.690 
time running and sprinting around the
map<00:00:31.140> it's<00:00:31.529> very<00:00:31.679> very<00:00:31.949> important<00:00:32.369> you<00:00:32.430> can

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
map it's very very important you can

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.910 
map it's very very important you can
ready<00:00:33.149> up<00:00:33.300> your<00:00:33.450> gun<00:00:33.660> faster<00:00:34.170> and<00:00:34.350> the<00:00:34.380> aim

this video we'll be showing you the

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.380 
this video we'll be showing you the
differences<00:00:38.040> between<00:00:38.190> running<00:00:38.730> it<00:00:38.969> and<00:00:39.149> not

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
differences between running it and not

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:40.310 
differences between running it and not
running<00:00:39.600> it<00:00:39.780> on<00:00:39.809> the<00:00:39.930> different<00:00:40.200> categories

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
running it on the different categories

over you will know what guns you want to

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.360 
over you will know what guns you want to
run<00:00:42.989> on<00:00:43.170> and<00:00:43.290> whether<00:00:43.440> you<00:00:43.620> think<00:00:43.770> it's<00:00:43.980> useful

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
run on and whether you think it's useful

run on and whether you think it's useful
to<00:00:44.520> you<00:00:44.610> so<00:00:44.760> here<00:00:44.910> we've<00:00:45.030> got<00:00:45.059> these

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
to you so here we've got these

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.090 
to you so here we've got these
submachine<00:00:45.750> guns<00:00:45.989> we've<00:00:46.110> got<00:00:46.260> the<00:00:46.379> mtar<00:00:46.890> and

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
submachine guns we've got the mtar and

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.220 
submachine guns we've got the mtar and
there<00:00:47.640> you<00:00:47.730> can<00:00:47.760> see<00:00:47.910> it<00:00:48.480> does<00:00:48.780> affect<00:00:49.079> it

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
there you can see it does affect it

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.959 
there you can see it does affect it
slightly<00:00:49.530> you<00:00:49.829> can<00:00:49.980> see<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.280> mtar<00:00:50.579> has<00:00:50.789> this

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
slightly you can see the mtar has this

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.450 
slightly you can see the mtar has this
kind<00:00:51.239> of<00:00:51.480> animation<00:00:51.930> where<00:00:52.350> it<00:00:52.469> drags<00:00:52.770> it<00:00:53.010> kind

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
kind of animation where it drags it kind

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.250 
kind of animation where it drags it kind
of<00:00:53.520> from<00:00:53.670> the<00:00:53.789> side<00:00:54.030> and<00:00:54.329> then<00:00:54.420> up<00:00:54.690> where<00:00:55.079> is

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
of from the side and then up where is

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.350 
of from the side and then up where is
with<00:00:55.500> ready<00:00:55.800> up<00:00:55.980> it's<00:00:56.250> just<00:00:56.640> straight<00:00:56.969> up<00:00:57.000> to

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
with ready up it's just straight up to

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.270 
with ready up it's just straight up to
the<00:00:57.449> screen<00:00:57.690> it's<00:00:57.870> instant<00:00:58.410> but<00:00:58.859> it<00:00:59.100> without

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
the screen it's instant but it without

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.979 
the screen it's instant but it without
it<00:00:59.520> seems<00:00:59.760> to<00:00:59.910> take<00:01:00.090> this<00:01:00.239> kind<00:01:00.449> of<00:01:00.539> extra

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
it seems to take this kind of extra

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.360 
it seems to take this kind of extra
animation<00:01:01.530> so<00:01:01.680> you<00:01:01.739> can<00:01:01.890> definitely<00:01:02.070> tell

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
animation so you can definitely tell

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.399 
animation so you can definitely tell
difference<00:01:02.910> and<00:01:03.090> obviously<00:01:03.899> the<00:01:04.110> submachine

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
difference and obviously the submachine

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:05.899 
difference and obviously the submachine
guns<00:01:04.739> rushing<00:01:05.100> around<00:01:05.189> it's<00:01:05.460> very<00:01:05.729> very

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
guns rushing around it's very very

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.390 
guns rushing around it's very very
important<00:01:06.360> anyway<00:01:06.900> and<00:01:07.140> then<00:01:07.950> moving<00:01:08.159> on<00:01:08.369> to

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
important anyway and then moving on to

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.370 
important anyway and then moving on to
the<00:01:08.549> assault<00:01:08.790> rifles<00:01:09.210> we've<00:01:09.360> got<00:01:09.510> the<00:01:09.689> honey

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
the assault rifles we've got the honey

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.920 
the assault rifles we've got the honey
badger<00:01:10.619> and<00:01:10.890> this<00:01:11.640> is<00:01:11.909> a<00:01:11.939> little<00:01:12.570> bit<00:01:12.689> less

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
badger and this is a little bit less

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.690 
badger and this is a little bit less
obvious<00:01:13.350> again<00:01:13.740> you<00:01:14.010> can<00:01:14.159> kind<00:01:14.430> of<00:01:14.460> tell<00:01:14.670> a

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
obvious again you can kind of tell a

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.399 
obvious again you can kind of tell a
trend<00:01:15.150> with<00:01:15.390> all<00:01:15.479> these<00:01:15.630> quick<00:01:15.930> perks<00:01:16.200> it

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
trend with all these quick perks it

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:17.870 
trend with all these quick perks it
seems<00:01:16.619> to<00:01:16.740> affect<00:01:16.830> the<00:01:17.040> submachine<00:01:17.369> guns<00:01:17.700> a

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
seems to affect the submachine guns a

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.910 
seems to affect the submachine guns a
lot<00:01:18.240> more<00:01:18.450> and<00:01:18.689> then<00:01:18.840> it<00:01:18.960> kind<00:01:19.200> of<00:01:19.290> fades<00:01:19.530> off

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
lot more and then it kind of fades off

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.800 
lot more and then it kind of fades off
as<00:01:20.130> you<00:01:20.280> go<00:01:20.430> through<00:01:20.640> the<00:01:20.759> categories<00:01:21.119> but<00:01:21.750> a

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
as you go through the categories but a

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.420 
as you go through the categories but a
nervous<00:01:22.229> i<00:01:22.439> think<00:01:22.830> i<00:01:23.009> would<00:01:23.159> definitely

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
nervous i think i would definitely

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.130 
nervous i think i would definitely
recommend<00:01:23.640> using<00:01:24.270> for<00:01:24.570> assault<00:01:24.810> rifles

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
recommend using for assault rifles

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.320 
recommend using for assault rifles
anyway<00:01:25.530> though<00:01:25.740> because<00:01:26.189> it's<00:01:26.729> always<00:01:27.060> just<00:01:27.270> a

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
anyway though because it's always just a

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:28.910 
anyway though because it's always just a
very<00:01:27.570> good<00:01:27.720> help<00:01:27.900> and<00:01:28.080> especially<00:01:28.590> because

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
very good help and especially because

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.710 
very good help and especially because
it's<00:01:29.070> a<00:01:29.159> one<00:01:29.400> point<00:01:29.610> park<00:01:29.939> mean<00:01:30.150> quick-draw<00:01:30.509> is
