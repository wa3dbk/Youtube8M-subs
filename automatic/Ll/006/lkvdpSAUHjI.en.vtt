I<00:00:12.570> know<00:00:12.840> Hogan<00:00:13.290> having<00:00:13.559> a<00:00:13.620> match<00:00:13.799> is<00:00:13.980> unlikely

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
I know Hogan having a match is unlikely

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.880 
I know Hogan having a match is unlikely
any<00:00:14.610> way<00:00:14.790> with<00:00:14.969> the<00:00:15.000> chances<00:00:15.450> of<00:00:15.480> WWE<00:00:16.139> doctors

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
any way with the chances of WWE doctors

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.310 
any way with the chances of WWE doctors
passing<00:00:17.609> him<00:00:17.760> fit<00:00:18.150> to<00:00:18.240> compete<00:00:18.449> very<00:00:18.840> slim<00:00:19.170> but

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
passing him fit to compete very slim but

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:20.599 
passing him fit to compete very slim but
I<00:00:19.410> was<00:00:19.560> thinking<00:00:19.890> about<00:00:20.010> it<00:00:20.279> it<00:00:20.400> actually

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
I was thinking about it it actually

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.370 
I was thinking about it it actually
would<00:00:20.939> not<00:00:21.060> be<00:00:21.270> too<00:00:21.420> bad<00:00:21.570> of<00:00:21.750> an<00:00:21.840> idea<00:00:21.930> if<00:00:22.289> it

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
would not be too bad of an idea if it

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.349 
would not be too bad of an idea if it
does<00:00:22.590> happen<00:00:23.039> it<00:00:23.519> would<00:00:23.670> most<00:00:23.880> likely<00:00:24.090> be<00:00:24.330> a

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
does happen it would most likely be a

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.089 
does happen it would most likely be a
WrestleMania<00:00:24.960> 31<00:00:25.320> which<00:00:25.740> would<00:00:25.920> mean<00:00:26.039> that

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
WrestleMania 31 which would mean that

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.339 
WrestleMania 31 which would mean that
Cena<00:00:26.880> would<00:00:27.090> be<00:00:27.210> kept<00:00:27.449> out<00:00:27.630> of<00:00:27.660> any<00:00:27.930> title

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
Cena would be kept out of any title

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.560 
Cena would be kept out of any title
matches<00:00:28.529> or<00:00:28.920> main<00:00:29.220> event<00:00:29.519> final<00:00:29.849> card<00:00:30.090> matches

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
matches or main event final card matches

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.500 
matches or main event final card matches

this<00:00:47.520> Hogan<00:00:48.000> has<00:00:48.239> always<00:00:48.690> claimed<00:00:49.500> that

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
this Hogan has always claimed that

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.170 
this Hogan has always claimed that
there's<00:00:49.890> going<00:00:50.010> to<00:00:50.070> be<00:00:50.129> one<00:00:50.430> more<00:00:50.610> match<00:00:50.879> I

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
there's going to be one more match I

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.450 
there's going to be one more match I
think<00:00:51.930> if<00:00:52.020> Hogan<00:00:52.199> were<00:00:52.469> on<00:00:52.590> his<00:00:52.739> deathbed<00:00:53.010> with

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
think if Hogan were on his deathbed with

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:54.950 
think if Hogan were on his deathbed with
tubes<00:00:53.760> hooked<00:00:53.969> up<00:00:54.180> to<00:00:54.360> him<00:00:54.480> he<00:00:54.600> would<00:00:54.719> still<00:00:54.930> be

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
tubes hooked up to him he would still be

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.560 
tubes hooked up to him he would still be
saying<00:00:55.289> one<00:00:56.160> more<00:00:56.370> match<00:00:56.579> brother<00:00:56.940> one<00:00:57.329> more

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
saying one more match brother one more

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.119 
saying one more match brother one more
match<00:00:57.750> it's<00:00:58.109> gonna<00:00:58.260> happen<00:00:58.530> Never<00:00:58.890> Say<00:00:59.100> Never

match<00:01:34.439> I<00:01:34.680> think<00:01:34.740> it<00:01:34.979> would<00:01:35.100> be<00:01:35.220> a<00:01:35.250> draw<00:01:35.520> I<00:01:35.790> think

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
match I think it would be a draw I think

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.399 
match I think it would be a draw I think
there's<00:01:36.210> enough<00:01:36.420> people<00:01:36.630> out<00:01:36.869> there<00:01:37.170> who

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
there's enough people out there who

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.740 
there's enough people out there who
maybe<00:01:38.100> don't<00:01:38.369> know<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:38.820> extent<00:01:39.210> of<00:01:39.360> Hogan's

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
maybe don't know the extent of Hogan's

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.960 
maybe don't know the extent of Hogan's
injuries<00:01:40.229> or<00:01:40.409> just<00:01:40.590> don't<00:01:40.799> care<00:01:41.040> he's<00:01:41.729> still<00:01:41.939> a

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
injuries or just don't care he's still a

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.550 
injuries or just don't care he's still a
big<00:01:42.210> enough<00:01:42.390> name<00:01:42.630> and<00:01:42.869> a<00:01:42.899> big<00:01:43.049> enough<00:01:43.259> star

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
big enough name and a big enough star

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.010 
big enough name and a big enough star
and<00:01:43.920> if<00:01:44.220> they<00:01:44.460> build<00:01:44.700> it<00:01:44.820> up<00:01:44.909> as<00:01:45.149> the<00:01:45.360> the<00:01:45.689> true

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
and if they build it up as the the true

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.080 
and if they build it up as the the true

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
final match of Hulk Hogan like this is

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.410 
final match of Hulk Hogan like this is
it

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
it

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.960 
it
after<00:01:48.840> a<00:01:48.869> 35-year<00:01:49.590> career<00:01:49.799> this<00:01:50.220> will<00:01:50.490> be<00:01:50.729> his

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
after a 35-year career this will be his

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.580 
after a 35-year career this will be his
final<00:01:51.360> match<00:01:51.479> that<00:01:51.780> you<00:01:51.869> better<00:01:52.079> order<00:01:52.350> the

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
final match that you better order the

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.020 
final match that you better order the
show<00:01:52.829> you<00:01:52.890> better<00:01:53.220> buy<00:01:53.369> a<00:01:53.399> ticket<00:01:53.729> I

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
show you better buy a ticket I

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.120 
show you better buy a ticket I
definitely<00:01:54.990> think<00:01:55.110> it<00:01:55.259> would<00:01:55.380> be<00:01:55.500> a<00:01:55.530> draw<00:01:55.860> I

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
definitely think it would be a draw I

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.550 
definitely think it would be a draw I
don't<00:01:56.579> think<00:01:56.729> it<00:01:56.790> would<00:01:56.880> be<00:01:56.969> a<00:01:57.000> good<00:01:57.210> match<00:01:57.560> but

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
don't think it would be a good match but

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.160 
don't think it would be a good match but
it<00:01:58.649> would<00:01:58.770> be<00:01:58.860> a<00:01:58.890> draw<00:01:59.189> that<00:01:59.899> sting<00:02:00.899> versus

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
it would be a draw that sting versus

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:02.810 
it would be a draw that sting versus
Undertaker<00:02:01.560> if<00:02:01.770> they<00:02:01.890> do<00:02:01.950> it<00:02:02.189> again<00:02:02.369> may<00:02:02.640> not

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
Undertaker if they do it again may not

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.420 
Undertaker if they do it again may not
be<00:02:02.939> a<00:02:02.969> good<00:02:03.149> match<00:02:03.350> but<00:02:04.350> definitely<00:02:05.250> would<00:02:05.399> be

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
be a good match but definitely would be

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.510 
be a good match but definitely would be
a<00:02:05.520> draw<00:02:06.320> but<00:02:07.320> you<00:02:07.649> better<00:02:07.860> have<00:02:08.099> a<00:02:08.129> hell<00:02:08.310> of<00:02:08.369> a

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
a draw but you better have a hell of a

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.309 
a draw but you better have a hell of a
third<00:02:08.759> match<00:02:08.970> to<00:02:09.300> round<00:02:09.509> out<00:02:09.690> that<00:02:09.720> top<00:02:10.080> of<00:02:10.259> the

Undertaker on the same show even with

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.350 
Undertaker on the same show even with
all<00:02:16.590> the<00:02:16.680> star<00:02:16.920> power<00:02:17.190> as<00:02:17.519> much<00:02:17.940> of<00:02:18.060> a<00:02:18.120> draws

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
all the star power as much of a draws

all the star power as much of a draws
those<00:02:18.599> matches<00:02:19.019> maybe<00:02:19.849> match<00:02:20.849> quality<00:02:21.180> is

00:02:21.619 --> 00:02:21.629 
those matches maybe match quality is

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:23.660 
those matches maybe match quality is
going<00:02:21.840> to<00:02:21.989> leave<00:02:22.500> a<00:02:22.530> lot<00:02:22.769> to<00:02:22.800> be<00:02:22.920> desired<00:02:23.190> so

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
going to leave a lot to be desired so

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.070 
going to leave a lot to be desired so
you<00:02:23.730> better<00:02:24.330> have<00:02:24.750> like<00:02:25.349> a<00:02:25.500> big<00:02:26.190> time

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
you better have like a big time

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:31.339 
you better have like a big time
guaranteed<00:02:28.640> blockbuster<00:02:29.640> in-ring<00:02:30.090> match<00:02:30.360> to

00:02:31.339 --> 00:02:31.349 
guaranteed blockbuster in-ring match to

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:33.259 
guaranteed blockbuster in-ring match to
carry<00:02:31.799> the<00:02:32.010> load<00:02:32.220> at<00:02:32.459> the<00:02:32.549> top<00:02:32.730> of<00:02:32.879> that<00:02:32.970> card

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:33.269 
carry the load at the top of that card

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:35.390 
carry the load at the top of that card
and<00:02:33.480> I'm<00:02:33.780> not<00:02:33.989> sure<00:02:34.170> Brock<00:02:34.500> Lesnar<00:02:35.040> against

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
and I'm not sure Brock Lesnar against

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.550 
and I'm not sure Brock Lesnar against
Roman<00:02:35.790> reigns<00:02:36.030> is<00:02:36.299> that<00:02:36.450> match<00:02:36.690> so<00:02:37.379> I<00:02:37.410> think

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
Roman reigns is that match so I think

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:38.690 
Roman reigns is that match so I think
they<00:02:37.830> may<00:02:37.980> have<00:02:38.010> to<00:02:38.220> go<00:02:38.250> in<00:02:38.459> a<00:02:38.549> different

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
they may have to go in a different

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.089 
they may have to go in a different
direction<00:02:38.970> if<00:02:39.420> that<00:02:39.900> word<00:02:40.260> actually<00:02:40.709> happened

00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:41.099 
direction if that word actually happened

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:42.559 
direction if that word actually happened
but<00:02:41.160> again<00:02:41.370> I<00:02:41.519> don't<00:02:41.580> think<00:02:41.790> Hogan's<00:02:42.299> gonna

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:42.569 
but again I don't think Hogan's gonna

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:43.910 
but again I don't think Hogan's gonna
ever<00:02:42.750> be<00:02:42.959> cleared<00:02:43.230> for<00:02:43.410> a<00:02:43.440> match<00:02:43.650> in<00:02:43.680> that

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
ever be cleared for a match in that

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:48.380 
ever be cleared for a match in that
company<00:02:44.280> ever<00:02:44.430> again<00:02:44.760> so<00:02:45.060> it's<00:02:45.720> a<00:02:45.959> moot<00:02:46.349> point
