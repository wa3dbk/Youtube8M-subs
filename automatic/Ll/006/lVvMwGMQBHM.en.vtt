00:00:00.489 --> 00:00:04.779
 to that the ball as usual in his orchestra Marseille search 

00:00:04.779 --> 00:00:08.780
 scientist based on the experience of the necessity of the service of god 

00:00:09.579 --> 00:00:13.479
 it channels the wisdom of the Kabbalah what is the need for service 

00:00:13.479 --> 00:00:15.759
 telus tv 

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:19.880
 from the fact that we find in a space filled with forces 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:20.939
 c 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:22.319
 in fact 

00:00:22.319 --> 00:00:23.419
 it's another 

00:00:23.419 --> 00:00:26.419
 chamber of strength and this strength 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:29.310
 acted on him 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.870
 and put pressure on our poor that we would become anyway 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.420
 that we wanted it we are a sensitive element 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:44.210
 yesterday we spoke we want good and were hurt by the repression of 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.190
 these forces this field 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:49.400
 you can call Turkish important door 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:52.490
 lobbied us spurned the man yes the people 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:57.860
 in this case we have no choice we are in everything and for all a 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:01.540
 desire for pleasure nothing else it's someone has 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:03.870
 pleasure 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.290
 a lot of suffering 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:11.110
 he can make me what he wants this is there general employment of this force 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:12.410
 who drives us 

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:15.410
 to nova be of equivalence of form with m 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.110
 and when we analyze see these things happen 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.850
 inevitably 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:28.090
 so we were able to join let's see km in cycle we are at the desire for the 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:29.040
 pleasure 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.150
 on one side we have 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:33.400
 the sufferings of the other 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:36.500
 the pleasures o2 have to go 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.079
 in the best way 

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:44.939
 possible that's why he's talking about the need for God's service where he 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.070
 there is no choice it is 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.050
 it is best to serve him to advance quickly before being 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:53.050
 caught by the blows from behind 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:57.670
 that's what georgia is all about 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:00.170
 we do not have 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.340
 a free choice only in 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:04.740
 very short range 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.999
 what attitude to adopt towards our development 

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:13.049
 we are not developing 

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:14.639
 we do not have the choice 

00:02:14.639 --> 00:02:17.369
 I constantly change situation rot 

00:02:17.369 --> 00:02:22.569
 so the railways the silos who quote the next situation so I live 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:26.029
 constantly exalted everything is fine for me 

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:30.239
 but every time I get to the next situation I feel better 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:33.899
 it's ecological and if I can not grow while I can not 

00:02:33.899 --> 00:02:36.609
 take it into consideration so much I feel bad after too 

00:02:36.609 --> 00:02:42.329
 so we can now far from living all the time very strange because 

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:45.329
 willy-nilly you will advance 

00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:50.329
 that's why the wisdom of the Kabbalah and another do not do that ' 

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:53.449
 explain to me in her article that she is meant for the workers 

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:56.669
 Courroye and on the other hand some men 

00:02:58.039 --> 00:02:59.589
 a 

00:02:59.589 --> 00:03:03.579
 the Kabbalists brings us something especially not for curiosity 

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:07.309
 but before receiving serious lessons 

00:03:08.789 --> 00:03:12.199
 we live hours being very hard it is desirable for us 

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:15.639
 to try using the Kabbalah to progress well 

00:03:15.639 --> 00:03:19.169
 so we deserve the jebel taurus 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:22.399
 m 

00:03:22.399 --> 00:03:25.739
 it's not about lucilly money cynical of a psychological problem 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:28.579
 imagine 

00:03:28.579 --> 00:03:32.730
 the situation in our development the weather good year 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:33.560
 and attractive
