out<00:03:24.470> our<00:03:24.620> printing<00:03:25.100> him<00:03:25.280> to<00:03:25.519> rapid<00:03:26.329> spin<00:03:26.600> and

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:26.810 
out our printing him to rapid spin and

be<00:03:30.829> faster<00:03:31.220> because<00:03:31.340> i<00:03:31.489> am<00:03:31.609> scarfed<00:03:32.060> and<00:03:32.269> this

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:32.510 
be faster because i am scarfed and this

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:34.150 
be faster because i am scarfed and this
