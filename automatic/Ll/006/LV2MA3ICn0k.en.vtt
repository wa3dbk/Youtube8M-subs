00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:07.859 
speedometer unit along with fuel gauge

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:11.839 
speedometer unit along with fuel gauge
and<00:00:08.220> the<00:00:08.340> vibrator<00:00:08.730> from<00:00:09.090> a<00:00:09.570> member<00:00:10.349> named<00:00:10.849> SB

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
and the vibrator from a member named SB

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:13.249 
and the vibrator from a member named SB
zero<00:00:12.420> zero<00:00:12.750> one

thank<00:00:14.070> you<00:00:14.190> for<00:00:14.370> that<00:00:14.900> the<00:00:16.160> new<00:00:17.160> gauge<00:00:17.400> is<00:00:17.699> in

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
thank you for that the new gauge is in

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.529 
thank you for that the new gauge is in
new<00:00:18.510> vibrators<00:00:19.170> and<00:00:19.199> everything<00:00:20.539> the

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
new vibrators and everything the

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.599 
new vibrators and everything the
speedometer<00:00:22.320> gauge<00:00:22.800> didn't<00:00:23.160> have<00:00:23.310> a<00:00:23.340> needle

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
speedometer gauge didn't have a needle

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.000 
speedometer gauge didn't have a needle
on<00:00:23.820> it<00:00:24.000> so<00:00:24.269> I'm<00:00:24.600> probably<00:00:25.439> going<00:00:25.619> to<00:00:25.710> use<00:00:25.769> that

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
on it so I'm probably going to use that

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.269 
on it so I'm probably going to use that
as<00:00:26.130> a<00:00:26.160> decoration<00:00:26.640> at<00:00:26.880> some<00:00:27.090> point<00:00:28.279> let's

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
as a decoration at some point let's

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:39.440 
as a decoration at some point let's
check<00:00:30.179> out<00:00:30.390> how<00:00:30.539> it's<00:00:30.720> wired<00:00:30.929> up<00:00:31.199> here<00:00:38.390> so<00:00:39.390> you

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
check out how it's wired up here so you

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:49.850 
check out how it's wired up here so you
have<00:00:39.510> the<00:00:39.660> sending<00:00:39.960> unit<00:00:40.020> wire<00:00:42.440> and<00:00:48.860> that

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
have the sending unit wire and that

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:56.810 
have the sending unit wire and that
comes<00:00:50.190> down<00:00:50.460> over<00:00:50.520> here<00:00:55.460> we've<00:00:56.460> got<00:00:56.670> an

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
comes down over here we've got an

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.639 
comes down over here we've got an
alligator<00:00:57.120> clip<00:00:57.629> to<00:00:57.660> the<00:00:58.020> top<00:00:58.199> of<00:00:58.350> the<00:00:58.410> shock

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
alligator clip to the top of the shock

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.810 
alligator clip to the top of the shock
tower<00:00:59.000> underground<00:01:01.039> and<00:01:02.039> then<00:01:02.219> I<00:01:02.250> found<00:01:02.550> this

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
tower underground and then I found this

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:08.990 
tower underground and then I found this
wire<00:01:03.320> which<00:01:04.320> is<00:01:04.710> a<00:01:06.260> 12<00:01:07.260> volt<00:01:07.530> on<00:01:07.740> the<00:01:08.040> key<00:01:08.280> or

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
wire which is a 12 volt on the key or

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.200 
wire which is a 12 volt on the key or
the<00:01:09.060> radio<00:01:10.070> well<00:01:11.070> since<00:01:11.400> my<00:01:11.610> radio<00:01:11.880> doesn't

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
the radio well since my radio doesn't

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.990 
the radio well since my radio doesn't
work<00:01:12.330> I<00:01:12.600> got<00:01:13.530> it<00:01:13.680> put<00:01:13.979> a<00:01:14.040> new<00:01:14.130> fitting<00:01:14.580> on<00:01:14.760> there

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
work I got it put a new fitting on there

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:23.990 
work I got it put a new fitting on there
and<00:01:16.310> applied<00:01:17.310> power<00:01:17.580> to<00:01:18.000> the<00:01:18.860> vibrator<00:01:23.000> this

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
and applied power to the vibrator this

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.980 
and applied power to the vibrator this
little<00:01:24.360> ground<00:01:24.659> wire<00:01:24.990> here<00:01:25.439> that's<00:01:25.710> paired<00:01:26.369> up

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:26.990 
little ground wire here that's paired up

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:30.319 
little ground wire here that's paired up
that's<00:01:27.990> for<00:01:28.409> the<00:01:28.650> ground<00:01:29.640> for<00:01:29.909> the<00:01:29.970> sending

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
that's for the ground for the sending

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:35.660 
that's for the ground for the sending
unit<00:01:30.659> which<00:01:31.729> is<00:01:32.729> no<00:01:33.479> good<00:01:33.780> anymore<00:01:34.490> it's<00:01:35.490> been

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
unit which is no good anymore it's been

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.789 
unit which is no good anymore it's been
leaking<00:01:35.880> gas<00:01:36.299> so<00:01:36.689> I<00:01:36.930> got<00:01:37.229> to<00:01:37.320> get<00:01:37.380> a<00:01:37.439> new<00:01:37.590> one<00:01:37.680> of

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
leaking gas so I got to get a new one of

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:54.950 
leaking gas so I got to get a new one of
those<00:01:38.780> but<00:01:39.780> yeah<00:01:40.619> we'll<00:01:41.460> see<00:01:41.640> how<00:01:41.790> it<00:01:41.939> works

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:04.550 

whole<00:01:55.960> thing
