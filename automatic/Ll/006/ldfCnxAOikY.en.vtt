00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:05.339
 all welcome on my channel today 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:09.170
 we have such a wonderful review 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:14.030
 the device is called naman tin jar 

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:17.810
 I got it from my neighbor in the garage 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:20.010
 Here was a completely new but even 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:22.590
 several times I managed my car 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.980
 start using this thing being 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:29.429
 when the battery has been discharged 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:30.510
 this device is used to start 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:37.200
 engine that is here 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:41.340
 connects it turns on in 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:43.290
 cigarette lighter and battery a little 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:48.770
 recharged that is to that extent 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:50.910
 what's enough for him to turn the starter here 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:53.640
 lay on me in the trunk somewhere 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.079
 a year and a half now I want to take it apart 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:59.120
 see what is actually there 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:02.760
 inside is stored under but immediately say that I 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:06.210
 already know there is stored what looked already 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:12.450
 reviews here but still need to make sure 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:18.710
 what is there really only 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:18.710
 unscrew the three screws 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:47.259
 and the woman watches the walls open the death of Ivan 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:53.140
 and here we have the usual fingers 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:54.250
 batteries so we can do something Che, 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:58.479
 varta batteries 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:02:01.600
 they twitter batteries well and for sure 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:03.039
 the cheapest one and a half volts and here 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.259
 actually how does this work 

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:06.759
 model like this charger then 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:08.800
 there is when it was a lot of output 

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:10.780
 issued about 30 volts well, just 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:16.330
 surprise you switches and sport on his 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:18.130
 gives here a sense not 20 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:21.130
 batteries 20 conventional batteries 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:23.380
 Deshmanskih I wonder if I'm here now 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:25.870
 I will put a normal battery you will start 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.610
 I get settled or not and if I put 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:30.130
 here 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:31.959
 aa batteries are always true 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:36.000
 in general will be a killer in the kit 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:36.000
 sweetheart such thing adapter 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:45.489
 we connect crocodiles as an emulator this 

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:47.380
 thing but here's a box like some 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:50.980
 microcircuit there is sealed this georgiki 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:53.769
 worth you need to look here but the device 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:56.920
 actually entitled to 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:58.630
 existence several times is possible 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:00.970
 Of course the engine start but then it 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:04.299
 you can sit down without a starter 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:08.790
 full battery capacity and it goes 

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:12.730
 you shouldn't throw it out 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:15.690
 I do not know, but 20 batteries to buy at 20 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:18.910
 400 rubles for this case will cost 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:21.519
 in order to let a couple of times 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:26.890
 engine but then change again 

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:28.500
 batteries so decide for yourself i probably 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:33.340
 I will throw a long box 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:35.040
 Soon my site is ordered 25 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:39.480
 batteries there 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:42.120
 for a camera for baby toys for 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:43.859
 the child is still there for different purposes but 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:45.659
 I will try to test change 

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:50.720
 put temporarily will not be 

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:53.329
 work here at all yet put huskies 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:59.209
