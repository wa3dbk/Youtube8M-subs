00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:52.830 
tweezers here's a quick look at the top

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:54.350 
tweezers here's a quick look at the top
and<00:01:53.100> that's<00:01:53.250> the<00:01:53.430> file<00:01:53.670> I<00:01:53.850> was<00:01:54.000> just<00:01:54.210> speaking

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
and that's the file I was just speaking

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.800 
and that's the file I was just speaking
about<00:01:55.939> here's<00:01:56.939> a<00:01:57.000> look<00:01:57.180> at<00:01:57.299> the<00:01:57.420> front<00:01:57.630> end

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
about here's a look at the front end

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.539 
about here's a look at the front end
with<00:01:57.960> both<00:01:58.170> sides<00:01:58.530> of<00:01:58.740> the<00:01:58.830> tweezers<00:01:59.220> and<00:01:59.490> you

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
with both sides of the tweezers and you

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.359 
with both sides of the tweezers and you
basically<00:01:59.700> squeeze<00:02:00.119> the<00:02:00.240> two<00:02:00.390> sides<00:02:00.600> together

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:01.369 
basically squeeze the two sides together

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:03.770 
basically squeeze the two sides together
and<00:02:02.369> now<00:02:02.549> you<00:02:02.610> have<00:02:02.790> a<00:02:02.820> very<00:02:03.000> small<00:02:03.450> set<00:02:03.689> of

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
and now you have a very small set of

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.999 
and now you have a very small set of
tweezers<00:02:06.170> here's<00:02:07.170> their<00:02:07.350> recommendation<00:02:07.920> of

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
tweezers here's their recommendation of

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.859 
tweezers here's their recommendation of
how<00:02:08.100> you<00:02:08.160> might<00:02:08.429> set<00:02:08.670> up<00:02:08.700> your<00:02:08.910> key<00:02:09.179> you<00:02:09.720> can

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
how you might set up your key you can

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.020 
how you might set up your key you can
see<00:02:09.989> the<00:02:10.110> carabiner<00:02:10.530> right<00:02:10.890> here<00:02:11.250> and<00:02:11.430> you<00:02:11.910> can

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
see the carabiner right here and you can

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.910 
see the carabiner right here and you can
also<00:02:12.269> see<00:02:12.540> that<00:02:12.630> it<00:02:12.750> fits<00:02:12.930> very<00:02:13.079> nicely<00:02:13.290> inside

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
also see that it fits very nicely inside

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.670 
also see that it fits very nicely inside
the<00:02:14.549> actual<00:02:14.940> tool<00:02:15.180> so<00:02:15.900> it's<00:02:16.110> not<00:02:16.230> like<00:02:16.440> you<00:02:16.560> can

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
the actual tool so it's not like you can

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.740 
the actual tool so it's not like you can
fit<00:02:16.890> a<00:02:16.920> ton<00:02:17.160> of<00:02:17.190> different<00:02:17.610> keys<00:02:17.790> in<00:02:18.000> there<00:02:18.150> but

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
fit a ton of different keys in there but

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.030 
fit a ton of different keys in there but
it's<00:02:18.989> not<00:02:19.110> like<00:02:19.230> you<00:02:19.320> actually<00:02:19.440> have<00:02:19.620> twice

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
it's not like you actually have twice

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.650 
it's not like you actually have twice
the<00:02:20.100> thickness<00:02:20.430> with<00:02:20.820> the<00:02:20.910> key<00:02:21.120> and<00:02:21.420> then<00:02:21.540> the

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
the thickness with the key and then the

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.420 
the thickness with the key and then the
thickness<00:02:21.840> of<00:02:22.140> the<00:02:22.260> tool<00:02:22.470> you<00:02:22.739> know<00:02:23.070> making<00:02:23.280> it

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
thickness of the tool you know making it

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.430 
thickness of the tool you know making it
