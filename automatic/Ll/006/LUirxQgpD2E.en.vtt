knowledge is just understand a little
bit<00:00:43.920> about<00:00:44.160> whole<00:00:44.430> steps<00:00:44.789> and<00:00:44.879> half<00:00:45.030> steps<00:00:45.680> so

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
bit about whole steps and half steps so

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.729 
bit about whole steps and half steps so
here<00:00:46.860> we<00:00:46.950> go<00:00:46.980> whole<00:00:47.879> step<00:00:48.180> on<00:00:48.329> guitar<00:00:48.660> is<00:00:48.899> when

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
here we go whole step on guitar is when

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.290 
here we go whole step on guitar is when
you<00:00:49.829> move<00:00:50.010> two<00:00:50.219> frets<00:00:50.460> at<00:00:50.640> a<00:00:50.700> time<00:00:50.910> so<00:00:51.149> let's

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
you move two frets at a time so let's

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.479 
you move two frets at a time so let's
say<00:00:51.420> we're<00:00:51.600> on<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:51.840> sixth<00:00:52.140> string<00:00:52.309> first<00:00:53.309> fret

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
say we're on the sixth string first fret

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.660 
say we're on the sixth string first fret
we<00:00:54.480> go<00:00:54.570> up<00:00:54.660> two<00:00:54.840> frets<00:00:55.129> you<00:00:56.129> just<00:00:56.370> move<00:00:56.520> the

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
we go up two frets you just move the

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.540 
we go up two frets you just move the
whole<00:00:56.820> step<00:00:57.090> two<00:00:57.960> more<00:00:58.140> friends<00:00:58.469> whole<00:00:59.250> step

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
whole step two more friends whole step

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:05.420 
whole step two more friends whole step
whole<00:01:00.270> step<00:01:00.800> whole<00:01:01.800> step<00:01:03.920> therefore<00:01:04.920> a<00:01:05.129> half

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
whole step whole step therefore a half

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.490 
whole step whole step therefore a half
step<00:01:05.729> is<00:01:06.000> just<00:01:06.150> moving<00:01:06.570> one<00:01:06.869> step<00:01:06.900> at<00:01:07.409> a<00:01:07.470> time

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
step is just moving one step at a time

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.920 
step is just moving one step at a time
one<00:01:07.950> fret<00:01:08.250> at<00:01:08.340> a<00:01:08.430> time<00:01:08.640> first<00:01:09.479> fret<00:01:09.840> 2nd<00:01:10.770> 3rd

always<00:01:34.170> right<00:01:34.350> next<00:01:34.590> to<00:01:34.680> each<00:01:34.770> other<00:01:34.920> matter

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
always right next to each other matter

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.660 
always right next to each other matter
what<00:01:35.549> string<00:01:35.850> we're<00:01:36.000> on<00:01:36.119> enf<00:01:37.460> always<00:01:38.460> right

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
what string we're on enf always right

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.630

next<00:01:38.939> to<00:01:39.000> each<00:01:39.090> other<00:01:40.070> so<00:01:41.070> if<00:01:41.189> we<00:01:41.310> think<00:01:41.340> of<00:01:41.549> the

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
next to each other so if we think of the

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.310 
next to each other so if we think of the
musical<00:01:42.060> alphabet<00:01:42.180> A<00:01:42.720> to<00:01:43.500> B<00:01:43.740> whole<00:01:44.610> step<00:01:45.170> b<00:01:46.170> to

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
musical alphabet A to B whole step b to

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.990 
musical alphabet A to B whole step b to
c<00:01:46.350> half<00:01:47.100> step<00:01:47.960> C<00:01:48.960> to<00:01:49.110> D<00:01:49.140> whole<00:01:49.799> step<00:01:50.100> d<00:01:50.820> to<00:01:50.970> e

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
c half step C to D whole step d to e

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.810 
c half step C to D whole step d to e
whole<00:01:51.810> step<00:01:51.840> e<00:01:52.350> to<00:01:52.740> F<00:01:52.979> there's<00:01:53.280> our<00:01:53.460> other<00:01:53.640> half

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
whole step e to F there's our other half

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.069 
whole step e to F there's our other half
step<00:01:54.119> F<00:01:54.270> to<00:01:55.079> G<00:01:55.110> whole<00:01:55.979> step<00:01:56.040> and<00:01:56.520> G<00:01:57.329> back<00:01:57.509> to<00:01:57.659> a<00:01:57.689> a

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
step F to G whole step and G back to a a

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.800 
step F to G whole step and G back to a a
whole<00:01:58.770> step<00:01:59.040> so<00:01:59.880> I<00:01:59.909> think<00:02:00.030> the<00:02:00.180> easiest<00:02:00.360> place

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
whole step so I think the easiest place

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.810 
whole step so I think the easiest place
to<00:02:00.840> picture<00:02:01.290> this<00:02:01.469> on<00:02:01.680> the<00:02:01.770> guitar<00:02:02.040> would<00:02:02.670> be

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
to picture this on the guitar would be

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.209 
to picture this on the guitar would be
the<00:02:02.969> 5th<00:02:03.270> string<00:02:03.600> and<00:02:04.020> standard<00:02:04.469> tuning<00:02:04.619> the

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
the 5th string and standard tuning the

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.779 
the 5th string and standard tuning the
5th<00:02:05.490> string<00:02:05.700> open<00:02:05.850> and<00:02:06.119> standard<00:02:06.509> tuning<00:02:06.689> is<00:02:06.990> a

00:02:07.779 --> 00:02:07.789 
5th string open and standard tuning is a

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:08.889 
5th string open and standard tuning is a
so

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 
so

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:10.509 
so
we're<00:02:08.989> going<00:02:09.110> to<00:02:09.170> go<00:02:09.259> up<00:02:09.439> the<00:02:09.979> fifth<00:02:10.280> string

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:10.519 
we're going to go up the fifth string

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:12.580 
we're going to go up the fifth string
and<00:02:10.700> see<00:02:10.909> if<00:02:11.030> we<00:02:11.150> can<00:02:11.299> use<00:02:11.540> our<00:02:11.810> fretboard

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
and see if we can use our fretboard

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.490 
and see if we can use our fretboard
knowledge<00:02:12.980> and<00:02:13.159> name<00:02:13.489> all<00:02:13.790> those<00:02:14.239> notes<00:02:14.599> so

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
knowledge and name all those notes so

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.839 
knowledge and name all those notes so
let's<00:02:15.650> go<00:02:15.829> fifth<00:02:16.129> string<00:02:16.370> open<00:02:18.340> whole<00:02:19.340> step<00:02:19.670> up

00:02:19.839 --> 00:02:19.849 
let's go fifth string open whole step up

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:21.630 
let's go fifth string open whole step up
to<00:02:20.000> be

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
to be

going back down a g.e.d seeing be a

00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:45.900 
going back down a g.e.d seeing be a
little<00:03:44.889> bit<00:03:45.010> harder<00:03:45.280> coming<00:03:45.549> back<00:03:45.700> down

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:45.910 
little bit harder coming back down

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:48.180 
little bit harder coming back down
uh-huh<00:03:46.630> why<00:03:46.989> is<00:03:47.049> that<00:03:47.230> well<00:03:47.980> let's<00:03:48.130> think

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:48.190 
uh-huh why is that well let's think

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:52.800 
uh-huh why is that well let's think
about<00:03:48.340> the<00:03:48.549> alphabet<00:03:49.030> from<00:03:49.989> A<00:03:50.200> to<00:03:50.230> G<00:03:51.810> abcdefg

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:52.810 
about the alphabet from A to G abcdefg

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:56.789 
about the alphabet from A to G abcdefg
real<00:03:53.440> fast<00:03:54.030> abcdefg<00:03:55.030> all<00:03:55.900> right<00:03:56.230> let's<00:03:56.590> think

00:03:56.789 --> 00:03:56.799 
real fast abcdefg all right let's think

00:03:56.799 --> 00:03:58.949 
real fast abcdefg all right let's think
about<00:03:56.829> the<00:03:57.010> alphabet<00:03:57.489> from<00:03:57.670> G<00:03:58.000> going<00:03:58.569> back<00:03:58.810> to

00:03:58.949 --> 00:03:58.959 
about the alphabet from G going back to

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:07.500 
about the alphabet from G going back to
a<00:03:59.280> GF<00:04:00.280> e<00:04:00.579> DC<00:04:01.060> be<00:04:01.690> a<00:04:02.310> GF<00:04:03.310> e<00:04:03.519> DC<00:04:04.120> be<00:04:04.480> a<00:04:04.799> GFE<00:04:05.799> dcba<00:04:06.510> all

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:07.510 
a GF e DC be a GF e DC be a GFE dcba all

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:09.930 
a GF e DC be a GF e DC be a GFE dcba all
right<00:04:07.810> a<00:04:08.019> little<00:04:08.440> bit<00:04:08.799> is<00:04:09.130> just<00:04:09.519> getting<00:04:09.730> used

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:09.940 
right a little bit is just getting used

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:11.000 
right a little bit is just getting used
to<00:04:10.060> saying<00:04:10.299> the<00:04:10.450> alphabet<00:04:10.480> backwards

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.010 
to saying the alphabet backwards

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:13.050 
to saying the alphabet backwards
certainly<00:04:12.010> in<00:04:12.099> music<00:04:12.370> we<00:04:12.489> move<00:04:12.669> up<00:04:12.849> and<00:04:12.970> down

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:13.060 
certainly in music we move up and down

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:15.270 
certainly in music we move up and down
equally<00:04:13.569> so<00:04:14.200> you<00:04:14.260> want<00:04:14.500> to<00:04:14.590> get<00:04:14.680> it<00:04:14.859> both

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:15.280 
equally so you want to get it both

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:17.370 
equally so you want to get it both
directions<00:04:15.489> so<00:04:16.419> let's<00:04:16.570> do<00:04:16.690> that<00:04:16.750> fist<00:04:17.139> string

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:17.380 
directions so let's do that fist string

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:29.909 
directions so let's do that fist string
one<00:04:17.590> more<00:04:17.799> time<00:04:18.010> a<00:04:20.010> b<00:04:21.010> c<00:04:21.870> d<00:04:22.919> e<00:04:24.570> and<00:04:25.770> g<00:04:28.800> let's<00:04:29.800> go

00:04:29.909 --> 00:04:29.919 
one more time a b c d e and g let's go

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:34.909 
one more time a b c d e and g let's go
back<00:04:30.099> hey<00:04:31.200> gene

00:04:34.909 --> 00:04:34.919 

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:42.270 

be<00:04:36.270> soon<00:04:37.439> be<00:04:39.689> very<00:04:40.689> good<00:04:41.009> so<00:04:42.009> once<00:04:42.159> you<00:04:42.250> have

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:42.280 
be soon be very good so once you have

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:44.820 
be soon be very good so once you have
the<00:04:42.460> 5th<00:04:42.669> string<00:04:42.909> sounding<00:04:43.710> really<00:04:44.710> good

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:44.830 
the 5th string sounding really good

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:47.219 
the 5th string sounding really good
let's<00:04:45.280> try<00:04:45.460> another<00:04:45.639> straight<00:04:46.150> this<00:04:46.659> will

00:04:47.219 --> 00:04:47.229 
let's try another straight this will

00:04:47.229 --> 00:04:49.110 
let's try another straight this will
work<00:04:47.379> on<00:04:47.590> any<00:04:47.830> string<00:04:48.250> whole<00:04:48.669> steps<00:04:48.939> and<00:04:49.030> half

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:49.120 
work on any string whole steps and half

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:51.749 
work on any string whole steps and half
steps<00:04:49.240> are<00:04:49.599> always<00:04:49.900> the<00:04:50.020> same<00:04:50.229> we<00:04:51.189> use<00:04:51.340> the<00:04:51.520> 6th

00:04:51.749 --> 00:04:51.759 
steps are always the same we use the 6th

00:04:51.759 --> 00:04:53.670 
steps are always the same we use the 6th
string<00:04:51.879> a<00:04:51.969> lot<00:04:52.150> for<00:04:52.389> power<00:04:52.539> cords<00:04:53.110> and<00:04:53.319> fruits

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:53.680 
string a lot for power cords and fruits

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:55.320 
string a lot for power cords and fruits
for<00:04:53.860> bar<00:04:54.069> chords<00:04:54.400> so<00:04:54.550> let's<00:04:54.699> try<00:04:54.879> the<00:04:54.939> 6th

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:55.330 
for bar chords so let's try the 6th

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:58.080 
for bar chords so let's try the 6th
string<00:04:55.479> open<00:04:55.629> yes<00:04:56.560> that's<00:04:56.770> an<00:04:56.949> E<00:04:57.099> so<00:04:57.879> we're

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:58.090 
string open yes that's an E so we're

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:01.980 
string open yes that's an E so we're
going<00:04:58.180> to<00:04:58.270> go<00:04:58.330> eat<00:04:58.830> half<00:04:59.830> step<00:05:00.159> to<00:05:00.280> F<00:05:00.689> will<00:05:01.689> step

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:01.990 
going to go eat half step to F will step
