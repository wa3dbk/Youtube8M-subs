the<00:01:15.900> super<00:01:16.200> tight<00:01:16.409> pocket<00:01:17.030> just<00:01:18.030> dependent<00:01:18.420> on

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
the super tight pocket just dependent on

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.260 
the super tight pocket just dependent on
accuracy<00:01:18.930> power<00:01:19.740> various<00:01:20.670> things<00:01:20.909> like<00:01:21.090> that

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
accuracy power various things like that

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:22.550 
accuracy power various things like that
so<00:01:21.479> that's<00:01:21.600> one<00:01:21.840> thing<00:01:21.960> you<00:01:22.080> want<00:01:22.229> to<00:01:22.290> be<00:01:22.380> used

so that's one thing you want to be used

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.560 
so that's one thing you want to be used

to when you're playing with another team

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.300 
to when you're playing with another team
and<00:01:24.600> what<00:01:25.140> Kaepernick<00:01:25.500> we<00:01:25.740> definitely<00:01:26.159> missed

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
and what Kaepernick we definitely missed

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.580 
and what Kaepernick we definitely missed
a<00:01:26.610> lot<00:01:27.060> of<00:01:27.240> throws<00:01:27.479> and<00:01:27.780> the<00:01:27.840> early<00:01:28.200> goings

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
a lot of throws and the early goings

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.249 
a lot of throws and the early goings
just<00:01:28.920> because<00:01:29.250> of<00:01:29.460> you<00:01:30.119> know<00:01:30.259> discrepancy

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
just because of you know discrepancy

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.950 
just because of you know discrepancy
between<00:01:31.409> those<00:01:31.829> two<00:01:32.100> rg3<00:01:32.880> can<00:01:33.210> often<00:01:33.570> sneak<00:01:33.810> in

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
between those two rg3 can often sneak in

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.840 
between those two rg3 can often sneak in
that<00:01:34.110> drag<00:01:34.409> route<00:01:34.680> whereas<00:01:35.130> Kaepernick<00:01:35.610> even

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
that drag route whereas Kaepernick even

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.490 
that drag route whereas Kaepernick even
though<00:01:35.939> he<00:01:36.000> has<00:01:36.119> good<00:01:36.299> throw<00:01:36.509> power<00:01:36.750> you<00:01:37.259> kind

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
though he has good throw power you kind

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.350 
though he has good throw power you kind
of<00:01:37.560> got<00:01:37.680> to<00:01:37.770> be<00:01:37.799> careful<00:01:38.009> with<00:01:38.280> that<00:01:38.310> so<00:01:38.729> you

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
of got to be careful with that so you

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.219 
of got to be careful with that so you
know<00:01:39.450> that's<00:01:39.570> one<00:01:39.840> thing<00:01:40.020> we've<00:01:40.200> been

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
know that's one thing we've been

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:41.569 
know that's one thing we've been
adjusting<00:01:40.799> for<00:01:40.950> the<00:01:41.100> other<00:01:41.280> thing<00:01:41.549> that's

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
adjusting for the other thing that's

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.120 
adjusting for the other thing that's
been<00:01:42.090> huge<00:01:42.420> for<00:01:42.479> us<00:01:42.659> on<00:01:42.840> the<00:01:42.899> ps3<00:01:43.170> that<00:01:43.950> we've

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
been huge for us on the ps3 that we've

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.120 
been huge for us on the ps3 that we've
been<00:01:44.369> doing<00:01:44.729> to<00:01:44.850> adjust<00:01:45.299> is<00:01:45.479> really<00:01:46.130> stepping

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
been doing to adjust is really stepping

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.399 
been doing to adjust is really stepping
back<00:01:47.579> and<00:01:47.880> cutting<00:01:48.299> back<00:01:48.509> our<00:01:48.720> steps<00:01:49.079> on<00:01:49.290> the

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
back and cutting back our steps on the

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.440 
back and cutting back our steps on the
on<00:01:49.649> the<00:01:49.710> defensive<00:01:50.340> side<00:01:50.399> and<00:01:50.790> the<00:01:51.119> reason<00:01:51.420> for

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
on the defensive side and the reason for

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.510 
on the defensive side and the reason for
that<00:01:51.630> is<00:01:51.930> because<00:01:51.960> you<00:01:52.470> can<00:01:52.710> adjust<00:01:52.860> quite<00:01:53.369> as

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
that is because you can adjust quite as

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.620 
that is because you can adjust quite as
fast<00:01:53.700> on<00:01:53.909> that<00:01:53.970> up<00:01:54.270> ps3<00:01:55.140> issue<00:01:55.409> can<00:01:55.710> xbox<00:01:56.630> so

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
going back to my old ways where I would

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.740 
going back to my old ways where I would
cut<00:02:48.930> out<00:02:49.109> like<00:02:49.500> a<00:02:49.530> final<00:02:49.980> step<00:02:50.250> or<00:02:50.489> really<00:02:51.180> key

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
cut out like a final step or really key

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:53.449 
cut out like a final step or really key
in<00:02:51.930> on<00:02:52.109> those<00:02:52.260> adjustments<00:02:52.680> and<00:02:53.069> making<00:02:53.310> sure

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
in on those adjustments and making sure

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:55.940 
in on those adjustments and making sure
i<00:02:53.519> was<00:02:53.640> making<00:02:53.940> just<00:02:54.750> minimal<00:02:55.319> good

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
i was making just minimal good

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.369 
i was making just minimal good
adjustments<00:02:56.700> rather<00:02:57.450> than<00:02:57.690> a<00:02:57.750> lot<00:02:58.019> of<00:02:58.170> decent

00:02:58.369 --> 00:02:58.379 
adjustments rather than a lot of decent

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:00.020 
adjustments rather than a lot of decent
ones<00:02:58.829> which<00:02:59.190> is<00:02:59.370> something<00:02:59.579> I<00:02:59.670> would<00:02:59.730> do<00:02:59.909> on

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
ones which is something I would do on

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:03.110 
ones which is something I would do on
xbox<00:03:00.650> kind<00:03:01.650> of<00:03:01.769> over<00:03:02.159> adjusting<00:03:02.819> and<00:03:02.970> that's

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
xbox kind of over adjusting and that's

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.670 
xbox kind of over adjusting and that's
one<00:03:03.299> thing<00:03:03.480> you<00:03:03.599> can<00:03:03.780> find<00:03:03.959> yourself<00:03:04.079> doing<00:03:04.440> a

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
one thing you can find yourself doing a

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.619 
one thing you can find yourself doing a
lot<00:03:04.829> you<00:03:05.640> might<00:03:05.819> not<00:03:05.970> be<00:03:06.120> making<00:03:06.299> too<00:03:06.540> many

00:03:06.619 --> 00:03:06.629 
lot you might not be making too many

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:08.420 
lot you might not be making too many
adjustments<00:03:06.959> but<00:03:07.379> you<00:03:07.530> might<00:03:07.739> be<00:03:07.890> making<00:03:08.129> too

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
adjustments but you might be making too

opponent's doing or you might be making
too<00:03:11.459> many<00:03:11.519> adjustments<00:03:11.819> because<00:03:12.180> it's<00:03:12.420> taking

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
too many adjustments because it's taking
