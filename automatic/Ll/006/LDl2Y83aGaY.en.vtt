that's<00:01:58.979> another<00:01:59.280> thing<00:01:59.729> about<00:01:59.850> improvisation

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
that's another thing about improvisation

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.270 
that's another thing about improvisation
that's<00:02:00.869> the<00:02:01.049> flipside<00:02:01.439> about<00:02:01.710> it<00:02:01.860> is<00:02:02.009> that

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
that's the flipside about it is that

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.490 
that's the flipside about it is that
once<00:02:02.700> you<00:02:02.820> play<00:02:03.090> it<00:02:03.149> it's<00:02:03.450> gone<00:02:03.750> you<00:02:04.320> don't

remember what you just did but I think I

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:09.740 
remember what you just did but I think I
do<00:02:06.180> and<00:02:06.619> what<00:02:07.619> I<00:02:08.190> did<00:02:08.459> here<00:02:08.819> is<00:02:08.970> on<00:02:09.360> the<00:02:09.599> E<00:02:09.630> flat

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
the first eight bars I'm staying with

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.700 
the first eight bars I'm staying with
the<00:02:34.910> structure<00:02:35.180> of<00:02:35.300> the<00:02:35.420> tune<00:02:35.690> the<00:02:36.260> left<00:02:36.470> hand

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:36.710 
the structure of the tune the left hand

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:40.240 
the structure of the tune the left hand
is<00:02:36.890> playing<00:02:37.250> the<00:02:37.850> same<00:02:38.980> chords<00:02:39.980> and

is playing the same chords and
accompaniment<00:02:40.850> as<00:02:40.970> it<00:02:41.180> would<00:02:41.360> if<00:02:41.450> I<00:02:41.540> were

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:41.690 
accompaniment as it would if I were

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:44.200 
accompaniment as it would if I were
playing<00:02:41.960> the<00:02:42.140> direct<00:02:42.470> melody<00:02:42.970> but<00:02:43.970> I'm

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:44.210 
playing the direct melody but I'm

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:47.170 
playing the direct melody but I'm
changing<00:02:45.110> the<00:02:45.140> right<00:02:45.470> hand<00:02:45.850> took<00:02:46.850> them<00:02:47.030> up

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
changing the right hand took them up

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.280 
changing the right hand took them up
with<00:02:47.330> a<00:02:47.360> different<00:02:48.430> with<00:02:49.430> a<00:02:49.460> different<00:02:49.880> idea

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
with a different with a different idea

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:54.460 
with a different with a different idea
now<00:02:51.290> we<00:02:51.350> can<00:02:51.710> try<00:02:51.980> something<00:02:52.850> again<00:02:53.660> for

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 
now we can try something again for

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:55.750 
now we can try something again for
another<00:02:54.620> eight<00:02:54.860> bar<00:02:55.100> is<00:02:55.250> completely

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 
another eight bar is completely

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:05.770 
another eight bar is completely
different

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:09.650 

there's<00:03:06.780> another<00:03:07.310> example<00:03:08.310> of<00:03:09.150> using<00:03:09.390> a

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
there's another example of using a

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:15.040 
there's another example of using a
combination<00:03:09.900> of<00:03:10.970> single<00:03:11.970> notes<00:03:12.150> and<00:03:12.360> octaves

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:15.050 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:28.610 

let's<00:03:16.050> try<00:03:16.230> one<00:03:16.500> more

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:32.370 

now<00:03:29.620> each<00:03:29.770> one<00:03:29.800> of<00:03:30.010> those<00:03:30.160> examples<00:03:31.140> we<00:03:32.140> did

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:32.380 
now each one of those examples we did

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:35.790 
now each one of those examples we did
different<00:03:32.980> things<00:03:33.420> melodically<00:03:34.420> with<00:03:35.290> the

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:35.800 
different things melodically with the

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:37.500 
different things melodically with the
melody<00:03:36.040> in<00:03:36.310> the<00:03:36.370> right<00:03:36.520> hand<00:03:36.790> I<00:03:36.910> never<00:03:37.150> really

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:37.510 
melody in the right hand I never really

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:40.020 
melody in the right hand I never really
approached<00:03:37.960> the<00:03:38.590> original<00:03:39.100> melody<00:03:39.280> in<00:03:39.520> any

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030 
approached the original melody in any

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:43.740 
approached the original melody in any
one<00:03:40.210> of<00:03:40.240> those<00:03:40.450> three<00:03:40.780> examples<00:03:41.700> and<00:03:42.700> like<00:03:43.570> I

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:43.750 
one of those three examples and like I

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:46.890 
one of those three examples and like I
say<00:03:44.020> the<00:03:44.980> downside<00:03:45.790> of<00:03:45.820> improvisation<00:03:46.330> is

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:46.900 
say the downside of improvisation is

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:48.210 
say the downside of improvisation is
that<00:03:47.080> when<00:03:47.230> you're<00:03:47.410> trying<00:03:47.650> to<00:03:47.770> explain<00:03:48.160> to

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:48.220 
that when you're trying to explain to

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:50.280 
that when you're trying to explain to
somebody<00:03:48.520> what<00:03:48.700> you<00:03:48.940> just<00:03:49.120> played<00:03:49.360> you<00:03:50.050> can't

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:50.290 
somebody what you just played you can't

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:51.780 
somebody what you just played you can't
remember<00:03:50.710> what<00:03:50.860> you<00:03:50.980> just<00:03:51.160> played<00:03:51.370> because

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:51.790 
remember what you just played because

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:56.250 
remember what you just played because
you<00:03:51.940> just<00:03:52.770> played<00:03:53.770> it<00:03:53.980> it<00:03:54.280> gets<00:03:54.700> like<00:03:55.000> a<00:03:55.260> stream

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:56.260 
you just played it it gets like a stream

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:57.720 
you just played it it gets like a stream
of<00:03:56.290> consciousness<00:03:56.830> that<00:03:57.100> runs<00:03:57.370> through<00:03:57.700> your

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:57.730 
of consciousness that runs through your

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:01.100 
of consciousness that runs through your
mind<00:03:57.880> once<00:03:58.390> you<00:03:58.480> develop<00:03:58.780> the<00:03:59.020> technique<00:03:59.470> and

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:01.110 
mind once you develop the technique and

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:04.440 
mind once you develop the technique and
it's<00:04:02.110> so<00:04:02.380> you'll<00:04:02.710> be<00:04:02.860> hard-pressed<00:04:03.250> to<00:04:03.850> figure

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:04.450 
it's so you'll be hard-pressed to figure

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:07.320 
it's so you'll be hard-pressed to figure
out<00:04:04.600> exactly<00:04:05.170> what<00:04:05.830> it<00:04:05.860> is<00:04:05.980> that<00:04:06.550> you<00:04:06.790> just<00:04:07.000> did

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:07.330 
out exactly what it is that you just did

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:16.080 
out exactly what it is that you just did
so<00:04:08.200> I<00:04:09.120> could<00:04:10.120> say<00:04:10.750> that<00:04:11.340> in<00:04:12.340> doing<00:04:14.760> those<00:04:15.760> three

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:16.090 
so I could say that in doing those three

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:21.380 
so I could say that in doing those three
examples<00:04:16.600> in<00:04:17.020> this<00:04:17.770> tune<00:04:18.570> that<00:04:19.570> I<00:04:19.900> made<00:04:20.170> use<00:04:20.530> of

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:21.390 
examples in this tune that I made use of

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:26.100 
examples in this tune that I made use of
different<00:04:22.390> types<00:04:22.660> of<00:04:22.930> melodic<00:04:23.590> invention<00:04:25.110> to

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:26.110 
different types of melodic invention to

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:29.580 
different types of melodic invention to
stay<00:04:26.410> within<00:04:26.680> the<00:04:27.010> style<00:04:27.370> I<00:04:28.140> didn't<00:04:29.140> play<00:04:29.380> any

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:29.590 
stay within the style I didn't play any

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:32.550 
stay within the style I didn't play any
bebop<00:04:29.950> lines<00:04:30.250> and<00:04:30.580> I<00:04:30.640> didn't<00:04:30.910> play<00:04:31.090> any<00:04:31.560> any

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:32.560 
bebop lines and I didn't play any any

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:35.070 
bebop lines and I didn't play any any
any<00:04:32.800> blues<00:04:33.310> figures<00:04:33.790> I<00:04:34.030> stayed<00:04:34.660> within<00:04:34.930> the

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:35.080 
any blues figures I stayed within the

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:38.580 
any blues figures I stayed within the
style<00:04:35.910> and<00:04:36.910> within<00:04:37.510> the<00:04:37.780> core<00:04:37.990> progression

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:38.590 
style and within the core progression

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:42.120 
style and within the core progression
but<00:04:39.400> came<00:04:39.730> up<00:04:39.760> with<00:04:39.940> a<00:04:40.150> different<00:04:41.100> with<00:04:42.100> a

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:42.130 
but came up with a different with a

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:44.370 
but came up with a different with a
different<00:04:42.490> idea<00:04:42.820> each<00:04:43.090> time<00:04:43.450> let's<00:04:44.080> try<00:04:44.350> a

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:44.380 
different idea each time let's try a

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:46.260 
different idea each time let's try a
whole<00:04:44.650> chorus<00:04:45.190> and<00:04:45.490> including<00:04:45.940> the<00:04:46.030> bridge

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:46.270 
whole chorus and including the bridge

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:49.230 
whole chorus and including the bridge
and<00:04:46.510> see<00:04:47.050> what<00:04:47.230> happens<00:04:47.880> first<00:04:48.880> eight<00:04:49.180> bars

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:49.240 
and see what happens first eight bars

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:52.470 
and see what happens first eight bars
i'll<00:04:49.750> play<00:04:49.930> will<00:04:50.140> be<00:04:50.170> the<00:04:50.380> original<00:04:50.590> melody

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:52.480 
i'll play will be the original melody

00:04:52.480 --> 00:05:33.850 
i'll play will be the original melody
you
