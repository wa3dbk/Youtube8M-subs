00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:07.980
 Hello everyone, are you watching the sockets with you 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.290
 good maxims and today in my hand 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.150
 interesting thing called sphere 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.120
 This bluetooth controlled ball 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:17.520
 with a baseball ball can do little but 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.890
 what can he knows how to taught him how 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.020
 it should be inside him 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.330
 stuff like accelerometer and gyroscope 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:27.359
 bluetooth led backlight module and others 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:30.029
 pieces think this amateur radio dream is a sphere 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.769
 works with phones on ios or android 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.870
 connects via bluetooth and in order 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.460
 to include below and in general a sphere 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.860
 you just need to shake him 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.870
 if it blinks it means it has stopped 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.980
 blink connected to the device after that 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.829
 can open any application 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.200
 compatible with the gadget and such applications 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.770
 a considerable amount is standard 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.090
 managed to as well as a bunch of games and programs 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:52.320
 standard application first explains 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.750
 how to use the sphere 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.789
 but this is all garbage and in the end I realized one thing 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.859
 rule in order not to stray from 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.870
 sense what way the ball will go 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.789
 turn it to yourself with a light bulb 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.769
 done using the app here there 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.540
 special wheel for turning in 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.920
 the rest of the ball is controlled through the joystick 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.500
 and if you do n't like it then 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.049
 accelerometer there is still a special mode 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.729
 I call it a super combo since when 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.890
 clicking on it with such an example 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:19.259
 mode, the ball will go forward dramatically 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.509
 choose a circular motion or zigzag 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:24.090
 besides this there is still a speed slider 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:26.340
 from the turtle and up to 1 meter per second 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.710
 the ball is pretty frisky for this funny 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.689
 watch well and the last fitch from the light 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.180
 inside there is a led backlight with a thousand 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:35.490
 color variations so here you can 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.020
 confirm in the appstore and google play 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.509
 the scope has a large number 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.850
 except the standard applications managed ki 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.710
 there are games like golf 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.840
 an application that allows twirling it in 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.369
 arm include different colors playing on 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.229
 rate by the way app using 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.759
 which can draw the lecture 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.180
 snakehead app 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:55.439
 and so on the sphere lasts for 2 hours 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:57.210
 nonstop play and it's good 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:59.310
 the result is direct super result 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.890
 considering that these toys are holding on 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.780
 maximum half an hour and then charge spa 3 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.759
 hours by the way you need to put the sphere in 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.979
 special dock station and he will 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:09.450
 charge by wireless charging and this 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.600
 also hello from the future 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:14.210
 Well, in general, is that 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:16.310
 from the category of entertainment for one evening but 

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:18.310
 there is an application, for example, if 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:21.350
 do you have children or have pets 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:23.420
 children and older and younger such a thing 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:24.440
 sure to like it if the first in 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.110
 joy to steer 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.910
 and the second will chase the animal too 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:31.010
 fun is the main thing not to play ball 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:33.140
 too big dog from a broken ball 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:35.630
 will take a radio amateur in the end what 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:37.640
 concerns me seemed funny and 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:39.910
 for three hours I entertained myself but no more 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.910
