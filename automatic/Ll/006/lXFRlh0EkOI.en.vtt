tripods<00:00:24.180> and<00:00:24.330> I'm<00:00:25.050> using<00:00:25.380> it<00:00:25.529> my<00:00:25.769> DSLR<00:00:26.130> and<00:00:26.430> I

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
tripods and I'm using it my DSLR and I

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.400 
tripods and I'm using it my DSLR and I
have<00:00:26.670> been<00:00:26.849> using<00:00:27.000> my<00:00:27.150> DSLR<00:00:27.630> since<00:00:28.019> I've<00:00:28.199> got

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
have been using my DSLR since I've got

have been using my DSLR since I've got
it<00:00:28.560> I<00:00:28.769> can<00:00:29.160> see<00:00:29.310> why<00:00:29.460> they're<00:00:29.699> saying<00:00:29.849> is

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
it I can see why they're saying is

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.970 
it I can see why they're saying is
designed<00:00:30.420> for<00:00:30.750> compact<00:00:31.260> cameras<00:00:31.679> because

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
designed for compact cameras because

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.010 
designed for compact cameras because
it's<00:00:32.130> simply<00:00:32.669> not<00:00:32.700> that<00:00:32.850> durable<00:00:33.510> but<00:00:33.750> it<00:00:33.809> does

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
it's simply not that durable but it does

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.410 
it's simply not that durable but it does
happily<00:00:34.469> hold<00:00:34.710> my<00:00:35.130> camera<00:00:35.670> and<00:00:35.850> it<00:00:36.000> does<00:00:36.180> say

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
happily hold my camera and it does say

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.299 
happily hold my camera and it does say
that<00:00:36.450> it<00:00:36.660> will<00:00:36.809> support<00:00:37.110> cameras<00:00:37.680> up<00:00:37.860> to<00:00:38.070> 2

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
that it will support cameras up to 2

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.220 
that it will support cameras up to 2
pounds<00:00:38.550> in<00:00:38.850> weight<00:00:39.030> so<00:00:39.600> the<00:00:39.690> build<00:00:39.870> cost<00:00:40.079> of

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
pounds in weight so the build cost of

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.229 
pounds in weight so the build cost of
this<00:00:40.320> tripod<00:00:40.770> is<00:00:40.950> fairly<00:00:41.579> good<00:00:41.760> really<00:00:42.059> and

they're<00:01:04.439> ok<00:01:04.860> however<00:01:05.400> they're<00:01:05.850> made<00:01:06.000> of<00:01:06.150> a

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
they're ok however they're made of a

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.539 
they're ok however they're made of a
very<00:01:06.570> solid<00:01:07.110> plastic<00:01:07.590> which<00:01:07.860> I<00:01:08.130> suppose<00:01:08.490> is

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
very solid plastic which I suppose is

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.039 
very solid plastic which I suppose is
brilliant<00:01:09.119> for<00:01:09.180> build<00:01:09.570> quality<00:01:09.750> and

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
brilliant for build quality and

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.260 
brilliant for build quality and
durability<00:01:10.350> but<00:01:11.130> whenever<00:01:11.310> I<00:01:11.580> was<00:01:11.820> opening

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
durability but whenever I was opening

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.060 
durability but whenever I was opening
and<00:01:12.450> closing<00:01:12.900> these<00:01:13.049> clips<00:01:13.439> I<00:01:13.590> often<00:01:13.920> found

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
and closing these clips I often found

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.620 
and closing these clips I often found
myself<00:01:14.189> cutting<00:01:14.760> my<00:01:14.850> fingers<00:01:15.180> a<00:01:15.210> bit<00:01:15.299> because

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
myself cutting my fingers a bit because

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.149 
myself cutting my fingers a bit because
they<00:01:15.869> have<00:01:16.020> such<00:01:16.200> sharp<00:01:16.500> edges<00:01:16.740> that<00:01:17.040> are

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
they have such sharp edges that are

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.219 
they have such sharp edges that are
quite<00:01:17.340> solid<00:01:17.729> and<00:01:17.850> so<00:01:18.720> they're<00:01:18.869> not<00:01:18.990> the<00:01:19.110> most

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
quite solid and so they're not the most

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.740 
quite solid and so they're not the most
ergonomic<00:01:19.470> of<00:01:20.130> Clips<00:01:20.369> the<00:01:20.670> tripod<00:01:21.060> also<00:01:21.360> has<00:01:21.540> a

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
ergonomic of Clips the tripod also has a

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.320 
ergonomic of Clips the tripod also has a
center<00:01:22.170> column<00:01:22.380> I<00:01:22.650> always<00:01:23.640> find<00:01:23.850> myself<00:01:24.090> using

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
center column I always find myself using

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.270 
center column I always find myself using
this<00:01:24.689> especially<00:01:25.020> for<00:01:25.320> scenarios<00:01:25.590> like<00:01:25.860> this

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
this especially for scenarios like this

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.010 
this especially for scenarios like this
because<00:01:26.850> otherwise<00:01:27.090> it's<00:01:27.420> just<00:01:27.720> quite<00:01:27.990> a

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
because otherwise it's just quite a

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.260 
because otherwise it's just quite a
short<00:01:28.320> dry<00:01:28.560> pod<00:01:28.799> without<00:01:29.490> the<00:01:29.790> center<00:01:30.090> column

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
short dry pod without the center column

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.660 
short dry pod without the center column
raised<00:01:30.600> it's<00:01:30.900> only<00:01:31.079> about<00:01:31.409> a<00:01:31.439> metre<00:01:31.770> tall<00:01:32.040> but

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
raised it's only about a metre tall but

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.850 
raised it's only about a metre tall but
then<00:01:32.790> centre<00:01:33.150> column<00:01:33.509> adds<00:01:33.720> about<00:01:34.020> 30<00:01:34.350> to<00:01:34.530> 40

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
then centre column adds about 30 to 40

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.560 
then centre column adds about 30 to 40
centimetres<00:01:35.400> extra<00:01:35.790> on<00:01:35.909> the<00:01:36.030> top<00:01:36.240> so<00:01:36.450> it's

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
centimetres extra on the top so it's

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.390 
centimetres extra on the top so it's
really<00:01:36.750> quite<00:01:36.900> useful<00:01:37.020> to<00:01:37.200> have<00:01:37.409> the<00:01:38.009> tripod

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
really quite useful to have the tripod

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.249 
really quite useful to have the tripod
has<00:01:38.579> rubber<00:01:38.880> feet<00:01:39.119> which<00:01:39.450> are<00:01:39.659> very<00:01:40.020> well

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
has rubber feet which are very well

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.740

built<00:01:40.500> and<00:01:40.799> quite<00:01:41.130> rugged<00:01:41.340> and<00:01:41.640> in<00:01:42.210> my<00:01:42.329> use<00:01:42.540> so

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
built and quite rugged and in my use so

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.749 
built and quite rugged and in my use so
far<00:01:42.930> they<00:01:43.140> seem<00:01:43.320> to<00:01:43.439> work<00:01:43.560> really<00:01:43.799> well<00:01:44.040> on<00:01:44.310> mud

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
far they seem to work really well on mud

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.929 
far they seem to work really well on mud
and<00:01:45.060> on<00:01:45.299> rocks<00:01:45.600> so<00:01:46.110> I<00:01:46.350> can't<00:01:46.920> fault<00:01:47.159> them<00:01:47.280> of

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
and on rocks so I can't fault them of

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.670 
and on rocks so I can't fault them of
course<00:01:48.119> being<00:01:48.420> a<00:01:48.509> very<00:01:48.720> small<00:01:48.810> tripod<00:01:49.170> means

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
course being a very small tripod means

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.530 
course being a very small tripod means
that<00:01:49.860> it<00:01:49.950> can<00:01:50.159> pack<00:01:50.430> up<00:01:50.460> into<00:01:51.119> a<00:01:51.149> very<00:01:51.420> small

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
that it can pack up into a very small

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.289 
that it can pack up into a very small
and<00:01:51.930> convenient<00:01:52.290> size<00:01:52.680> hence<00:01:53.579> why<00:01:53.850> it's<00:01:54.060> used

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
and convenient size hence why it's used

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.330 
and convenient size hence why it's used
for<00:01:54.600> travel<00:01:55.079> I've<00:01:55.649> use<00:01:55.950> this<00:01:56.070> a<00:01:56.130> lot<00:01:56.189> for

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
for travel I've use this a lot for

for travel I've use this a lot for
travel<00:01:56.759> and<00:01:56.909> it<00:01:57.270> goes<00:01:57.509> nicely<00:01:57.750> onto<00:01:58.409> the<00:01:58.530> back

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680

another<00:03:04.780> thing<00:03:04.989> about<00:03:05.110> this<00:03:05.319> tripod<00:03:05.739> that

another thing about this tripod that
makes<00:03:06.040> it<00:03:06.160> seem<00:03:06.310> quite<00:03:06.580> budget<00:03:07.030> oriented<00:03:07.300> is

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:07.690 
makes it seem quite budget oriented is

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:09.900 
makes it seem quite budget oriented is
it<00:03:08.170> doesn't<00:03:08.440> have<00:03:08.620> a<00:03:08.799> quick-release<00:03:09.100> plate<00:03:09.400> a

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:22.510 
like about the tripod thread though is

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:24.930 
like about the tripod thread though is
that<00:03:22.930> it's<00:03:23.380> small<00:03:23.560> enough<00:03:23.920> not<00:03:24.280> to<00:03:24.459> block<00:03:24.670> any

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:24.940 
that it's small enough not to block any

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:26.670 
that it's small enough not to block any

the bottom which some tripods can get in

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:33.720 
the bottom which some tripods can get in
the<00:03:32.560> way<00:03:32.680> of<00:03:32.709> especially<00:03:33.370> if<00:03:33.459> they<00:03:33.549> have<00:03:33.700> a
