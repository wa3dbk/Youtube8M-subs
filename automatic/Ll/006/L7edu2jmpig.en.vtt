00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.889 
believe it's less situational when
people<00:01:42.659> like<00:01:42.869> to<00:01:42.990> think<00:01:43.259> um<00:01:44.479> but<00:01:45.479> when<00:01:45.630> you<00:01:45.659> get

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
people like to think um but when you get

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.200 
people like to think um but when you get
it<00:01:46.020> off<00:01:46.170> it<00:01:46.500> more<00:01:46.740> or<00:01:46.860> less<00:01:47.009> seals<00:01:47.549> the<00:01:47.970> game

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
it off it more or less seals the game

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.719 
it off it more or less seals the game
that's<00:01:48.750> kind<00:01:49.110> of<00:01:49.259> like<00:01:49.590> starlight<00:01:50.520> Road

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
that's kind of like starlight Road

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.480 
that's kind of like starlight Road
effect<00:01:51.030> it<00:01:51.600> can<00:01:51.960> be<00:01:52.170> dead<00:01:52.409> but<00:01:52.740> when<00:01:53.130> you<00:01:53.310> get

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
effect it can be dead but when you get

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.940 
effect it can be dead but when you get
it<00:01:53.640> off<00:01:53.790> you're<00:01:54.390> pretty<00:01:54.869> much<00:01:54.930> guaranteed<00:01:55.439> to

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
it off you're pretty much guaranteed to

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.340 
it off you're pretty much guaranteed to
win<00:01:56.070> that<00:01:56.280> game<00:01:56.579> I<00:01:56.850> mean<00:01:57.509> obviously<00:01:57.659> this<00:01:58.200> is<00:01:58.320> a

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
win that game I mean obviously this is a

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.920 
win that game I mean obviously this is a
number<00:01:58.560> over<00:01:59.040> exaggeration<00:01:59.610> and<00:02:00.030> I<00:02:00.659> shouldn't

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
number over exaggeration and I shouldn't

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.590 
number over exaggeration and I shouldn't
be<00:02:00.990> quoted<00:02:01.380> but<00:02:01.590> it's<00:02:02.040> it's<00:02:02.579> a<00:02:02.790> pretty<00:02:03.240> decent

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
be quoted but it's it's a pretty decent

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:04.730 
be quoted but it's it's a pretty decent
rule<00:02:03.719> of<00:02:03.810> thumb<00:02:03.960> like<00:02:04.110> if<00:02:04.259> you<00:02:04.350> get<00:02:04.500> it<00:02:04.619> off

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
rule of thumb like if you get it off

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.249 
rule of thumb like if you get it off
you're<00:02:04.979> in<00:02:05.009> a<00:02:05.310> huge<00:02:05.520> advantage<00:02:05.810> so<00:02:06.810> the<00:02:07.079> other

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
you're in a huge advantage so the other

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.020 
you're in a huge advantage so the other
thing<00:02:07.350> which<00:02:07.680> doubles<00:02:08.069> up<00:02:08.160> on<00:02:08.340> is<00:02:08.550> you<00:02:08.670> can<00:02:08.849> use

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
thing which doubles up on is you can use

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.619 
thing which doubles up on is you can use
it<00:02:09.060> on<00:02:09.390> pretty<00:02:09.840> much<00:02:10.050> any<00:02:10.580> power<00:02:11.580> card<00:02:12.000> like

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629 
it on pretty much any power card like

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:13.850 
it on pretty much any power card like
your<00:02:13.020> three<00:02:13.319> MST

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
your three MST

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.230 
your three MST
you're<00:02:14.100> heavy<00:02:14.370> you're<00:02:14.580> a<00:02:14.610> born<00:02:14.910> your<00:02:15.060> dark

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
you're heavy you're a born your dark

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.750 
you're heavy you're a born your dark
hole<00:02:15.450> two<00:02:15.990> tranches<00:02:16.320> tumor<00:02:16.830> forces<00:02:17.340> all<00:02:17.490> of

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
hole two tranches tumor forces all of

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.120 
hole two tranches tumor forces all of
that<00:02:17.910> so<00:02:18.540> once<00:02:18.930> you<00:02:19.050> have<00:02:19.260> any<00:02:19.530> of<00:02:19.680> those<00:02:19.800> cards

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
that so once you have any of those cards

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:22.430

these<00:04:22.169> it's<00:04:22.500> a<00:04:22.590> pretty<00:04:22.800> good<00:04:22.979> card<00:04:23.190> and<00:04:23.430> then

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:23.910 
these it's a pretty good card and then

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:26.450 
these it's a pretty good card and then
also<00:04:24.120> with<00:04:24.840> upcoming<00:04:25.080> sets<00:04:25.830> and<00:04:26.190> this<00:04:26.370> is

searches for any spell book and then

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:47.060 
searches for any spell book and then

play out but I definitely think retour

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:29.930 
play out but I definitely think retour
will<00:05:26.010> have<00:05:27.620> some<00:05:28.620> say<00:05:28.860> in<00:05:28.890> that<00:05:29.190> it<00:05:29.520> could<00:05:29.820> also

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:29.940 
will have some say in that it could also

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:32.090 
will have some say in that it could also
be<00:05:30.060> cool<00:05:30.360> it<00:05:30.630> matches<00:05:30.990> such<00:05:31.140> as<00:05:31.290> heroes<00:05:31.710> that's

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:32.100 
be cool it matches such as heroes that's

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:34.040 
be cool it matches such as heroes that's
definitely<00:05:32.640> another<00:05:33.120> application<00:05:33.660> I'm

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:34.050 
definitely another application I'm

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:36.860 
definitely another application I'm
having<00:05:34.980> your<00:05:35.220> e<00:05:35.460> calls<00:05:35.700> and<00:05:36.120> your<00:05:36.210> Rhoda<00:05:36.510> and

having your e calls and your Rhoda and
your<00:05:37.050> sparks<00:05:37.560> and<00:05:37.950> your<00:05:38.100> hero<00:05:38.310> blasts<00:05:38.910> that's

your sparks and your hero blasts that's

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:41.090 
your sparks and your hero blasts that's
definitely<00:05:39.900> another<00:05:40.050> mirror<00:05:40.350> match<00:05:40.560> where<00:05:40.860> it

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:41.100 
definitely another mirror match where it

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:43.310 
definitely another mirror match where it
could<00:05:41.250> be<00:05:41.400> really<00:05:41.970> really<00:05:42.120> useful<00:05:42.630> especially

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:43.320 
could be really really useful especially

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:45.260 
could be really really useful especially
in<00:05:43.890> this<00:05:44.010> one<00:05:44.220> because<00:05:44.400> this<00:05:44.820> one<00:05:45.000> is<00:05:45.090> probably

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:45.270 
in this one because this one is probably

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:47.600 
in this one because this one is probably
the<00:05:45.600> biggest<00:05:45.750> one<00:05:46.200> in<00:05:46.380> terms<00:05:46.590> of<00:05:46.770> having<00:05:47.340> to

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:47.610 
the biggest one in terms of having to

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:50.060 
the biggest one in terms of having to
battle<00:05:47.760> out<00:05:47.970> resources<00:05:48.600> and<00:05:48.900> more<00:05:49.650> of<00:05:49.740> a<00:05:49.800> grind

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:50.070 
battle out resources and more of a grind

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:52.190 
battle out resources and more of a grind
where<00:05:50.729> a<00:05:50.760> plus<00:05:51.060> one<00:05:51.360> is<00:05:51.600> that<00:05:51.780> much<00:05:51.990> more

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:52.200 
where a plus one is that much more

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:54.469 
where a plus one is that much more
relevant<00:05:52.380> now<00:05:53.310> we<00:05:53.880> also<00:05:54.030> have<00:05:54.210> to<00:05:54.270> consider

00:05:54.469 --> 00:05:54.479 
relevant now we also have to consider

00:05:54.479 --> 00:05:57.080 
relevant now we also have to consider
heroes<00:05:55.169> isn't<00:05:55.560> that<00:05:55.680> big<00:05:55.860> of<00:05:55.890> a<00:05:56.070> deck<00:05:56.340> but<00:05:57.000> if

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:57.090 
heroes isn't that big of a deck but if

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:58.550 
heroes isn't that big of a deck but if
you<00:05:57.180> are<00:05:57.390> playing<00:05:57.660> heroes<00:05:58.050> this<00:05:58.290> would<00:05:58.440> be

00:05:58.550 --> 00:05:58.560 
you are playing heroes this would be

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:00.140 
you are playing heroes this would be
something<00:05:58.800> like<00:05:59.010> you'd<00:05:59.400> want<00:05:59.640> to<00:05:59.700> side<00:05:59.910> in

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:00.150 
something like you'd want to side in

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:01.610 
something like you'd want to side in
case<00:06:00.330> you<00:06:00.510> play<00:06:00.690> against<00:06:00.960> the<00:06:01.140> mirror<00:06:01.320> match

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:01.620 
case you play against the mirror match

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:04.010 
case you play against the mirror match
and<00:06:01.979> also<00:06:02.550> things<00:06:02.760> such<00:06:02.970> as<00:06:03.000> like<00:06:03.390> warriors

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:04.020 
and also things such as like warriors

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:06.770 
and also things such as like warriors
noble<00:06:04.380> knights<00:06:04.560> basically<00:06:05.210> most<00:06:06.210> sort<00:06:06.630> of

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:06.780 
noble knights basically most sort of

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:08.540 
noble knights basically most sort of
mirror<00:06:07.050> matches<00:06:07.530> you'd<00:06:07.830> want<00:06:08.070> to<00:06:08.130> play<00:06:08.310> them

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:08.550 
mirror matches you'd want to play them

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:10.190 
mirror matches you'd want to play them
again<00:06:08.790> like<00:06:09.390> this<00:06:09.570> would<00:06:09.690> be<00:06:09.720> a<00:06:09.810> card<00:06:10.110> you

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:10.200 
again like this would be a card you

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:13.430 
again like this would be a card you
could<00:06:10.410> definitely<00:06:10.590> side<00:06:11.300> even<00:06:12.300> if<00:06:12.510> your<00:06:12.720> deck

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:13.440 
could definitely side even if your deck

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:15.409 
could definitely side even if your deck
isn't<00:06:13.680> like<00:06:14.100> terribly<00:06:14.490> played<00:06:14.760> to<00:06:14.880> begin<00:06:15.210> with

00:06:15.409 --> 00:06:15.419 
isn't like terribly played to begin with

00:06:15.419 --> 00:06:17.270 
isn't like terribly played to begin with
you<00:06:15.990> still<00:06:16.260> want<00:06:16.470> to<00:06:16.530> prepare<00:06:16.860> for<00:06:17.070> everything

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:17.280 
you still want to prepare for everything

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:20.240 
you still want to prepare for everything
possible<00:06:17.720> I<00:06:18.720> wouldn't<00:06:19.440> play<00:06:19.590> it<00:06:19.800> in<00:06:19.919> water

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:20.250 
possible I wouldn't play it in water

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:22.130 
possible I wouldn't play it in water
water<00:06:21.120> is<00:06:21.270> definitely<00:06:21.600> not<00:06:21.660> that<00:06:21.840> great<00:06:21.960> of<00:06:22.020> an

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:22.140 
water is definitely not that great of an

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:23.840 
water is definitely not that great of an
application<00:06:22.260> obviously<00:06:23.220> it's<00:06:23.340> a<00:06:23.400> monster

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:23.850 
application obviously it's a monster

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:25.610 
application obviously it's a monster
based<00:06:24.060> deck<00:06:24.330> even<00:06:24.960> if<00:06:25.050> you<00:06:25.140> get<00:06:25.290> get<00:06:25.470> off<00:06:25.590> a

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:25.620 
based deck even if you get get off a

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:27.350 
based deck even if you get get off a
salvager<00:06:26.250> sphere<00:06:26.640> you're<00:06:27.090> going<00:06:27.240> to<00:06:27.300> be

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:27.360 
salvager sphere you're going to be

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:29.930 
salvager sphere you're going to be
sitting<00:06:27.510> on<00:06:27.720> dead<00:06:28.050> most<00:06:28.320> of<00:06:28.440> the<00:06:28.530> time<00:06:28.770> so<00:06:29.640> like

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:29.940 
sitting on dead most of the time so like

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:32.060 
sitting on dead most of the time so like
I<00:06:30.090> said<00:06:30.150> the<00:06:30.720> best<00:06:31.110> decks<00:06:31.440> to<00:06:31.590> be<00:06:31.680> playing<00:06:31.919> it

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:32.070 
I said the best decks to be playing it

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:34.640 
I said the best decks to be playing it
in<00:06:32.220> would<00:06:32.490> be<00:06:32.550> fire<00:06:33.120> fist<00:06:33.510> and<00:06:33.720> prophecy

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:34.650 
in would be fire fist and prophecy

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:36.550 
in would be fire fist and prophecy
especially<00:06:35.190> after<00:06:35.340> the<00:06:35.460> new<00:06:35.580> set<00:06:35.760> comes<00:06:36.000> out

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:36.560 
especially after the new set comes out

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:38.930 
especially after the new set comes out
um<00:06:37.560> I<00:06:37.620> think<00:06:37.890> it's<00:06:38.190> a<00:06:38.250> really<00:06:38.370> cool<00:06:38.550> card<00:06:38.820> to

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:38.940 
um I think it's a really cool card to

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:40.250 
um I think it's a really cool card to
play<00:06:39.060> and<00:06:39.450> that's<00:06:39.539> you<00:06:39.690> some<00:06:39.870> quick<00:06:39.990> advantage

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:40.260 
play and that's you some quick advantage

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.020 
play and that's you some quick advantage
and<00:06:40.650> it<00:06:40.800> can<00:06:40.919> help<00:06:41.070> seal<00:06:41.310> some<00:06:41.460> duels

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:42.030 
and it can help seal some duels

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:43.550 
and it can help seal some duels
if<00:06:42.450> you<00:06:42.600> haven't<00:06:42.900> picked<00:06:43.050> up<00:06:43.200> your<00:06:43.380> place<00:06:43.530> that

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:43.560 
if you haven't picked up your place that

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:45.980 
if you haven't picked up your place that
yet<00:06:43.860> I<00:06:43.890> would<00:06:44.040> definitely<00:06:44.540> consider<00:06:45.540> doing

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:45.990 
yet I would definitely consider doing
