00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
a lot from now to 2025 we thought how

a lot from now to 2025 we thought how
they<00:00:41.460> going<00:00:41.579> to<00:00:41.670> do<00:00:41.730> that<00:00:41.760> since<00:00:42.420> the

and other technologies our cars have

and other technologies our cars have
pulled<00:00:47.940> more<00:00:48.180> power<00:00:48.480> with<00:00:49.079> less<00:00:49.440> fuel<00:00:49.739> but

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
pulled more power with less fuel but

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.939 
pulled more power with less fuel but
we've<00:00:50.760> kind<00:00:51.090> of<00:00:51.239> hit<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:51.719> wall<00:00:51.930> it<00:00:52.410> seems<00:00:52.680> it's

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
we've kind of hit the wall it seems it's

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.830 
we've kind of hit the wall it seems it's
hard<00:00:53.460> to<00:00:53.640> make<00:00:53.789> an<00:00:53.910> engine<00:00:54.239> more<00:00:54.390> efficient

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
hard to make an engine more efficient

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.180 
hard to make an engine more efficient
and<00:00:54.930> that's<00:00:55.410> not<00:00:55.500> the<00:00:55.620> best<00:00:55.649> way<00:00:55.890> to<00:00:55.980> go

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
and that's not the best way to go

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.099 
and that's not the best way to go
instead<00:00:56.610> automakers<00:00:57.300> are<00:00:57.420> opting<00:00:57.780> to<00:00:57.809> shed

instead automakers are opting to shed
pounds<00:00:58.140> and<00:00:58.800> reduce<00:00:59.070> drag<00:00:59.460> aerodynamics<00:01:00.420> can

pounds and reduce drag aerodynamics can

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.990 
pounds and reduce drag aerodynamics can
be<00:01:01.050> beneficial<00:01:01.500> for<00:01:01.800> example<00:01:02.309> a<00:01:02.399> boxy<00:01:02.760> truck

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
be beneficial for example a boxy truck

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.609 
be beneficial for example a boxy truck
would<00:01:03.180> have<00:01:03.300> a<00:01:03.329> lot<00:01:03.600> more<00:01:03.629> difficulty<00:01:04.199> pushing

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
would have a lot more difficulty pushing

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.530 
would have a lot more difficulty pushing
through<00:01:04.769> the<00:01:04.890> air<00:01:05.010> than<00:01:05.549> a<00:01:05.580> sleek<00:01:05.909> sports<00:01:06.210> car

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
through the air than a sleek sports car

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.539 
through the air than a sleek sports car
the<00:01:07.020> better<00:01:07.200> the<00:01:07.350> aerodynamics<00:01:07.950> of<00:01:08.010> a<00:01:08.130> car<00:01:08.340> the

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
the better the aerodynamics of a car the

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.670 
the better the aerodynamics of a car the
less<00:01:08.700> drag<00:01:09.090> you<00:01:09.299> get<00:01:09.540> from<00:01:09.750> air<00:01:09.960> resistance

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
less drag you get from air resistance

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.820 
less drag you get from air resistance
thus<00:01:10.950> a<00:01:11.220> lower<00:01:11.610> drag<00:01:12.299> coefficient<00:01:13.080> if<00:01:13.560> you<00:01:13.680> can

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
thus a lower drag coefficient if you can

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.260 
thus a lower drag coefficient if you can
reduce<00:01:13.950> the<00:01:14.220> drag<00:01:14.369> coefficient<00:01:14.549> by<00:01:15.000> point

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
reduce the drag coefficient by point

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.380 
reduce the drag coefficient by point
zero<00:01:15.360> one<00:01:15.990> you'll<00:01:16.560> gain<00:01:16.710> point<00:01:17.220> two<00:01:17.610> miles<00:01:18.210> per

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
zero one you'll gain point two miles per

zero one you'll gain point two miles per

the<00:01:30.030> manufacturer<00:01:30.689> can<00:01:30.900> make<00:01:31.079> a<00:01:31.110> car<00:01:31.380> more

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619

they'll<00:01:33.720> have<00:01:33.840> less<00:01:34.110> car<00:01:34.470> to<00:01:34.619> pull<00:01:34.860> with<00:01:35.220> the

the<00:02:15.300> second<00:02:15.660> easiest<00:02:15.780> way<00:02:16.170> is<00:02:16.230> to<00:02:16.320> make<00:02:16.530> sure

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
the second easiest way is to make sure

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:17.840 
the second easiest way is to make sure
that<00:02:16.770> your<00:02:16.890> tires<00:02:17.130> are<00:02:17.400> at<00:02:17.490> the<00:02:17.550> proper

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850 
that your tires are at the proper

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:19.580 
that your tires are at the proper
pressure<00:02:18.060> yeah<00:02:18.450> I<00:02:18.510> know<00:02:18.570> this<00:02:18.930> seems<00:02:19.320> kind<00:02:19.500> of

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
pressure yeah I know this seems kind of

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.310 
pressure yeah I know this seems kind of
silly<00:02:19.860> and<00:02:19.980> whatever<00:02:20.670> but<00:02:21.120> it's<00:02:21.600> actually<00:02:22.110> way

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:22.320 
silly and whatever but it's actually way

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.020 
silly and whatever but it's actually way
better<00:02:22.530> because<00:02:22.770> most<00:02:23.130> of<00:02:23.250> us<00:02:23.340> drive<00:02:23.610> on<00:02:23.760> under

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
better because most of us drive on under

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.210 
better because most of us drive on under
inflated<00:02:24.330> tires<00:02:24.510> which<00:02:25.380> increases<00:02:26.040> the

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
inflated tires which increases the

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.580 
inflated tires which increases the
friction<00:02:26.490> with<00:02:26.850> the<00:02:26.880> road<00:02:27.350> decreasing<00:02:28.350> fuel
