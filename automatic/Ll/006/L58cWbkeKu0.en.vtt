 Meet me on 8th. Yeah , well, it's more of a boil. 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:23.519
 Make people think that they'll like me and make them like it. 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:25.170
 He followed in the energy source of the article, I have surprising strength of the group is being stretched 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:28.470
 It sounds like something like that. 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:32.640
 Oh, the trick is yes. 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:37.200
 In fact, I did not even know that Duk-geun was a rival. 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:40.649
 I know people who cook food to make the fact that the various categories 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:44.489
 One of the finest food is fasting for 400 years between 9 of the time 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:49.410
 Of course, first of all, I have to make a lot of money by eating massive food. 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.980
 I thought, but how do you supply more delicious food cheaper 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.329
 I will 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:57.719
 I think I'm cheap, but spread to eight people, and I love every boepneun 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.920
 How this restaurant can pay for food so good so good like it too 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:04.589
 You're crazy . 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:07.530
 So that's why it's really energy and really making the best of it. 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:12.150
 In doing so it is now heard in the Internet 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:17.100
 I tried my own way about the experiential ceremony, but there are very poor evaluations 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:22.650
 Of course, there may be someone who does not like it , 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:26.850
 When energy is consumed, it is not my greed, but what is it? 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:32.640
 Maybe I should be able to get some vitality out of it. 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:38.070
 I wasnt nude ethnic've contributed Then my biggest problem is my own 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:41.280
 People hate because he is the wood In thereby avoiding dose people 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:45.180
 4. The front rooms would be a dream for example, what happened 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:49.500
 Let's start doing something about the two people in ten people 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:55.320
 Oh, yes, yes. 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:58.430
 So let me breathe. I'm not shrinking . 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.430
 You know how to look. 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:08.090
 Well Well Well I'm always walking head down coming 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:11.420
 Flower child neck disc now of laputaeta 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:17.030
 Did you deliver does not like me very 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:21.920
 So I do not inherit the new drama drama. 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:26.900
 This is the title of the two concubines that are going to use the crown . 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:27.980
 Oh, look , if you are popular, you have to endure that much weight. 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:33.800
 I am 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:42.620
 I felt like this , but in our opinion, it is too tower , 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:52.190
 I thought that you would be doing well, but I appreciate something 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:56.720
 8 I did not take care of them ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:59.480
 I'm janseupnikka did appear to raise sseoon for example, and now the question that is 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:02.630
 4 times. So if you have a lot of life counseling 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:05.510
 You have a lot of people you like. 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:10.160
 I will only use it when some guests come. 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:14.420
 We have a group of two of them, 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:17.450
 I'm talking about counseling and talking about what to do. 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:21.500
 I do not think there are people like this. 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:22.459
 Yes, how do I do that, but he is not a bad thing. 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:27.829
 I mean. 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:32.299
 Because people have a point of view of what they see and ignore it 

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:36.500
 You do not have to respond to it or do it too sensitively. 

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:41.870
 So now it's time to let it go. 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:42.890
 Why does it rain when we have a contribution in the old days? 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:48.500
 Woven ok 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:51.650
 Now it is 80% b You know what the probability is 70 Revision 1 Oil Pro 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:57.980
 50% More 3 couples say this. 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:04:02.870
 So there is no chance that rain will come to zero. 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:09.349
 I do not have an example . I mean, the possibilities are always open. 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:10.940
 So , for example , 7 out of 10 comments 

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:17.479
 Earthquake zone 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:19.489
 When the world's first criticism is Right. But the world, and I go out and 

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:25.430
 The second method is 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:31.760
 If 10 months is like revisiting ah can not try to change 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:32.900
 1 finely itjyo can make two to eight dogs in the world, so that efforts need 

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:38.330
 That's it. 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:43.070
 Could not you raise the percentage if you make a little effort? 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:48.199
 But it is 100% that we are disappointed because 

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:53.360
 That hageodeunyo disappointed about whether to be long but if we breathe in

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:07.830
 I actually buy meat. 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:07.830
