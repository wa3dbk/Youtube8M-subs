because of this you'll force people to
go<00:06:48.930> back<00:06:49.110> early<00:06:49.440> you'll<00:06:49.770> get<00:06:49.980> a<00:06:50.010> level<00:06:50.670> and

incredibly early the other thing you can

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:10.520 
incredibly early the other thing you can
do<00:07:07.890> too<00:07:08.070> is<00:07:08.100> because<00:07:08.550> he<00:07:08.850> is<00:07:09.030> a<00:07:09.090> pseudo<00:07:09.600> jungler

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:10.530 
do too is because he is a pseudo jungler

00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:12.470 
do too is because he is a pseudo jungler
more<00:07:10.740> so<00:07:10.950> you<00:07:11.370> can<00:07:11.580> just<00:07:11.730> roam<00:07:11.970> down<00:07:12.150> to<00:07:12.270> mid

00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:12.480 
more so you can just roam down to mid

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:14.060 
more so you can just roam down to mid
lane<00:07:12.660> and<00:07:12.840> then<00:07:13.200> just<00:07:13.380> jump<00:07:13.590> in<00:07:13.740> with<00:07:13.860> another

lane and then just jump in with another
EQ<00:07:14.760> and<00:07:14.940> then<00:07:15.060> dunk<00:07:15.390> the<00:07:15.510> mid<00:07:15.690> laner<00:07:15.870> and

EQ and then dunk the mid laner and

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:17.600 
EQ and then dunk the mid laner and
you'll<00:07:16.200> have<00:07:16.350> way<00:07:16.710> too<00:07:16.770> much<00:07:17.010> burst<00:07:17.310> for<00:07:17.520> them

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:17.610 
you'll have way too much burst for them

00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:19.100 
you'll have way too much burst for them
to<00:07:17.730> live<00:07:17.880> through<00:07:18.060> if<00:07:18.240> your<00:07:18.390> mid<00:07:18.540> laner<00:07:18.750> even

00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:19.110 
to live through if your mid laner even

00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:21.530 
to live through if your mid laner even
helps<00:07:19.380> a<00:07:19.470> little<00:07:19.620> bit<00:07:19.890> so<00:07:20.070> Jarvan<00:07:20.730> is<00:07:20.850> a<00:07:21.060> early

00:07:21.530 --> 00:07:21.540 
helps a little bit so Jarvan is a early
