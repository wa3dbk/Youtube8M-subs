or<00:00:57.160> the<00:00:57.250> second<00:00:57.610> set<00:00:58.170> work<00:00:59.170> for<00:00:59.350> Richard<00:00:59.680> I'll

00:00:59.910 --> 00:00:59.920 
or the second set work for Richard I'll

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.649 
or the second set work for Richard I'll
go<00:01:00.129> first

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:03.659 

00:01:03.659 --> 00:01:05.969 

okay<00:01:04.659> then<00:01:04.839> Daniel<00:01:05.170> this<00:01:05.260> is<00:01:05.409> your<00:01:05.530> question

okay then Daniel this is your question

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:08.399 
okay then Daniel this is your question
what<00:01:06.369> is<00:01:06.580> the<00:01:06.760> second<00:01:07.240> closest<00:01:07.810> planet<00:01:08.229> to<00:01:08.259> the

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:08.409 
what is the second closest planet to the

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:11.249 
what is the second closest planet to the
Sun<00:01:08.799> in<00:01:08.979> our<00:01:09.100> solar<00:01:09.159> system<00:01:10.000> the<00:01:10.600> earth<00:01:10.630> Venus

00:01:11.249 --> 00:01:11.259 
Sun in our solar system the earth Venus

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:14.430 
Sun in our solar system the earth Venus
or<00:01:11.650> Neptune<00:01:12.000> okay<00:01:13.000> well<00:01:13.240> mercury<00:01:13.750> the<00:01:13.810> closest

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:14.440 
or Neptune okay well mercury the closest

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.190 
or Neptune okay well mercury the closest
and<00:01:14.680> the<00:01:15.040> next<00:01:15.250> planet<00:01:15.400> Venus<00:01:15.850> so<00:01:16.240> Venus<00:01:16.659> is<00:01:17.080> my

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:17.200 
and the next planet Venus so Venus is my

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.889 
and the next planet Venus so Venus is my
answer<00:01:18.090> would<00:01:19.090> have<00:01:19.150> to<00:01:19.270> be<00:01:19.390> wouldn't<00:01:19.600> it<00:01:19.750> it's

00:01:19.889 --> 00:01:19.899 
answer would have to be wouldn't it it's

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:22.020 
answer would have to be wouldn't it it's
the<00:01:20.140> right<00:01:20.320> one<00:01:20.500> to<00:01:20.530> Venus<00:01:21.520> is<00:01:21.700> correct<00:01:21.970> the

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:22.030 
the right one to Venus is correct the

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:24.590 
the right one to Venus is correct the
second<00:01:22.299> closest<00:01:22.600> planet<00:01:22.930> to<00:01:22.960> the<00:01:23.080> Sun<00:01:23.340> Kevin

hear<00:01:43.569> me<00:01:44.229> I've<00:01:45.069> got<00:01:45.310> an<00:01:45.399> idea<00:01:45.460> that

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:45.729 
hear me I've got an idea that

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:48.389 
hear me I've got an idea that
reflexology<00:01:46.390> is<00:01:46.740> primarily<00:01:47.740> involves<00:01:48.250> the

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:15.120 
pancreas the heart or the liver right
it's<00:02:10.899> definitely<00:02:11.560> not<00:02:11.680> the<00:02:11.860> heart

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:20.550
