 protectorate and the archangel lords to

 over time the arcane lords 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.910

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:49.890
 leaving them about to get their 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.350
 enemies declared forever

 the day of the final showdown army 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.489
 the protectorate was at a disadvantage and 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.390
 jumps and poorly equipped 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.649

 seemed to be lost atrox appeared 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.340
 between the soldiers of the protectorate a 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.170
 little more than a few words he 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.450
 raised the soldiers to fight to the 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.260
 last minute before playing in the 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.030
 confrontation

 soon the warriors and realized taken 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.829
 as the content thirst for battle 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.560
 followed the exchange in the fight each one of them 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:40.040
 struggling with the furious force of 10 and even 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.899

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:45.810
 atrox disappeared after that battle 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:48.390

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:54.710
 others until they finally 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:57.930
 they got back home victorious 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:02:00.000
 his compatriots called him heroes 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.280
 but although they had saved their 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.770

 a disgusting revelation his acts of 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:19.549
 heroism were actually atrocities 

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:21.170
 brutal conditions committed by their own 

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:23.780
 hands 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:26.390
