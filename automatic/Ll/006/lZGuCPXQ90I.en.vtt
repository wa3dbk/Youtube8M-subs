00:00:01.609 --> 00:00:04.700
 risanare presents co rox system 

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:07.220
 the solution yes 

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:10.220
 for the restoration of the walls 

00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:17.730
 poprocks is once in powder entirely mineral for restoration 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.960
 and the dehumidification of walls degraded by humidity and 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.960
 crystallizations who knows 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.270
 I discover x'd applies without having to demolish the existing plaster 

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:38.970
 except in cases where they are very deteriorated 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:41.090
 with little resistance 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:45.330
 in this case the surfaces must be prepared suitable withers 

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:48.330
 placed in full compliance 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:02.790
 It is simple to mix 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:05.790
 takes a few minutes to prepare 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:41.950
 red coop respects the original plaster and maintains the correct balance of 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:44.950
 transpiration 

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:45.659
 low environmental impact does not contain harmful substances 

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:47.580
 100% inorganic 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:50.580
 100% improve 

00:03:56.179 --> 00:03:58.889
 coprox is comparable to our skin 

00:03:58.889 --> 00:04:03.280
 allows the correct transpiration of the wall on which it is applied and is light 

00:04:03.279 --> 00:04:06.279
 in the policy and lasts over time 

00:04:07.089 --> 00:04:09.119
 co prox is the fuck solution 

00:04:09.119 --> 00:04:12.989
 activates the walls for the recovery and maintenance of the cellars 

00:04:13.859 --> 00:04:16.859
 interior and exterior of historic civil buildings 

00:04:17.559 --> 00:04:20.559
 I am depressed 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:38.650
 coprox system go heal 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:39.600
 innovative solutions
