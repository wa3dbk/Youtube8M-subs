00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:16.740

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.619
 same people I do not know if you guys 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:24.539

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:29.099
 being that in the light version it is instead of 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:31.949
 new ice cream takes is and some deforested 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:35.640

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.680

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.960
 what you will need offers of mold 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:56.090
 It's basically mango, I advise 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:59.660
 You put in two sleeves. 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:02.899
 if you want to two cups sub-23 cups 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:05.509
 so put two sleeves for late 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:07.340
 cultural itaÃº will be half of the 

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:10.430
 package that comes from something of a natural rate 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:14.810
 I like new skim milk and ml of milk 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:17.330
 also skimmed and half passion fruit 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:19.250
 passion fruit will give a unique taste a 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:21.800
 instead of a single and will enhance the flavor of 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:24.259
 so we and he are good people then 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:26.300
 Let's start with yahoo 

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:31.610
 skimmed as it was for you, it 's half 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:33.530
 of the pot that already comes with it 100 ml of 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:35.509
 skimmed milk 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:37.220
 you can too and it was when the 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:40.729
 propositions according to the quantity 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:43.100
 you want to develop we're 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:45.649
 put the mango two sleeves ficadinha 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:48.039
 this cuts jiechi along with caldinho 

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:48.039
 her 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:01.260
 in passion fruit medium that will give a flavor 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.880
 single at this moment she just tasted amanda 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:05.760

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.410
 refreshing will be neither jealous then 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:10.320
 it is optional for you want you can 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:11.640
 Do not put as the fruit can also be 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:13.440
 your choice is not 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:16.800
 strawberry or any other type of 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:19.200
 fruit and lots of ice to stay well 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:22.490
 Ice cold stay almost milkshake 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.490
 this number comes right 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:35.470
 then just close and hit everybody 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:37.330
 no need to beat him is very 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:39.700
 pretty fluid consciousness right? 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:42.220
 let's leave a more consistent 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:44.890
 milkshake is that same consistency 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:46.600
 heavier and then just put the note 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:49.900
 so this was what I had 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:51.760
 orange to match I also found it 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:56.400
 big serves but one two three cups 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:56.400
 milk or has a small bowl decoration 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:02.700
 and if you want you can move forward with 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:04.680
 sweetener 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.730
 so this is it we're super ready 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.010
 practical and simple 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:09.420
 It's a delight and refreshing I hope 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.840
 many had liked to stay with God and 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.840
