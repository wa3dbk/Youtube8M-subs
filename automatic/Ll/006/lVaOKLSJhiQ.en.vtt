00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.400 
it is very runny so you have to really
you<00:02:32.130> know<00:02:32.580> apply<00:02:33.030> it<00:02:33.090> with<00:02:33.450> caution<00:02:33.870> because

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
you know apply it with caution because

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:37.970 
you know apply it with caution because
it<00:02:34.950> tends<00:02:35.250> to<00:02:35.370> run<00:02:35.820> off<00:02:36.090> to<00:02:36.360> the<00:02:36.480> side<00:02:36.750> it<00:02:37.230> dries

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
it tends to run off to the side it dries

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.090 
it tends to run off to the side it dries
off<00:02:38.580> quickly<00:02:39.270> and<00:02:39.630> it<00:02:40.410> gives<00:02:40.710> up<00:02:40.920> this

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 
off quickly and it gives up this

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:42.980 
off quickly and it gives up this
beautiful<00:02:41.480> velvety<00:02:42.480> finish

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:20.260 
lipsticks they tend to leave this very

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:24.660 
lipsticks they tend to leave this very
heavy<00:04:21.030> glossy<00:04:22.030> feel<00:04:22.420> over<00:04:23.410> your<00:04:23.770> lips<00:04:24.070> but

heavy glossy feel over your lips but

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:26.970 
heavy glossy feel over your lips but
