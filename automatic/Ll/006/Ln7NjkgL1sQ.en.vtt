the light turned on and I our thing so
that's<00:01:24.340> that<00:01:24.670> and<00:01:24.970> to<00:01:25.270> replace<00:01:25.540> the<00:01:25.750> batteries

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:26.140 
that's that and to replace the batteries

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:27.840 
that's that and to replace the batteries
I<00:01:26.260> made<00:01:26.410> it<00:01:26.560> simple<00:01:26.950> as<00:01:27.040> well<00:01:27.220> you<00:01:27.550> could<00:01:27.700> just

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:27.850 
I made it simple as well you could just

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:30.000 
I made it simple as well you could just
pull<00:01:28.060> it<00:01:28.150> off<00:01:28.300> like<00:01:28.450> that<00:01:28.750> unclip<00:01:29.440> the<00:01:29.650> wire

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:30.010

pull it off like that unclip the wire
and<00:01:30.310> then<00:01:30.520> replace<00:01:31.150> them<00:01:31.390> if<00:01:31.870> you<00:01:32.050> need<00:01:32.230> so

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
and then replace them if you need so

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.920 
and then replace them if you need so
I'll<00:01:33.970> put<00:01:34.330> the<00:01:34.630> thing<00:01:35.470> back<00:01:35.500> on<00:01:36.870> so<00:01:37.870> the

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:37.930 
I'll put the thing back on so the

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:40.860 
I'll put the thing back on so the
battery<00:01:38.200> box<00:01:38.320> is<00:01:38.530> back<00:01:38.710> on<00:01:38.950> so<00:01:39.580> yeah<00:01:39.970> that's

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:40.870 
battery box is back on so yeah that's

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:43.350 
battery box is back on so yeah that's
that<00:01:41.080> and<00:01:41.590> the<00:01:41.770> switch<00:01:42.040> works<00:01:42.460> both<00:01:42.700> ways<00:01:42.970> so

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:43.360 
that and the switch works both ways so

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:45.480 
that and the switch works both ways so
this<00:01:43.720> one<00:01:43.960> has<00:01:44.290> the<00:01:44.530> four-wheel<00:01:44.950> drive<00:01:45.250> the

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:45.490 
this one has the four-wheel drive the

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:47.040 
this one has the four-wheel drive the
independent<00:01:45.970> suspension<00:01:46.510> I<00:01:46.630> can<00:01:46.810> show<00:01:46.960> you

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:47.050 
independent suspension I can show you

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:49.890 
independent suspension I can show you
right<00:01:47.170> now<00:01:47.790> has<00:01:48.790> the<00:01:48.820> steering<00:01:49.390> up<00:01:49.510> here<00:01:49.750> with

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:49.900 
right now has the steering up here with

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:54.060 
right now has the steering up here with
an<00:01:50.020> M<00:01:50.140> motor<00:01:50.350> and<00:01:51.060> on<00:01:52.060> the<00:01:52.240> bottom<00:01:52.600> has<00:01:53.440> the<00:01:53.890> two

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:54.070

XL<00:01:54.460> motors<00:01:54.820> for<00:01:55.060> the<00:01:55.120> drive<00:01:56.790> so<00:01:57.790> I'll<00:01:58.450> clip<00:01:58.780> on

00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:58.930 
XL motors for the drive so I'll clip on

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:01.320 
XL motors for the drive so I'll clip on
the<00:01:59.080> body<00:01:59.260> and<00:01:59.590> then<00:01:59.800> show<00:02:00.190> you<00:02:00.250> all<00:02:00.790> the

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:04.860 
the body and then show you all the
features<00:02:01.690> working<00:02:02.170> so<00:02:03.420> we'll<00:02:04.420> turn<00:02:04.600> it<00:02:04.750> on

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:04.870 
features working so we'll turn it on

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:08.550 
features working so we'll turn it on
make<00:02:05.440> it<00:02:05.470> easier<00:02:05.920> and<00:02:06.450> now<00:02:07.450> what<00:02:07.810> you<00:02:07.930> do<00:02:08.110> is<00:02:08.289> to

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560 
make it easier and now what you do is to

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.250 
make it easier and now what you do is to
make<00:02:08.709> these<00:02:08.890> sturdier<00:02:09.420> this<00:02:10.420> one<00:02:10.720> back<00:02:11.080> one

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
make these sturdier this one back one

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.420 
make these sturdier this one back one
sturdier<00:02:11.739> I<00:02:11.860> made<00:02:12.730> it<00:02:12.910> to<00:02:13.030> where<00:02:13.090> you<00:02:13.240> clip<00:02:13.540> it

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
sturdier I made it to where you clip it

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.050 
sturdier I made it to where you clip it
like<00:02:15.430> that<00:02:15.670> so

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
like that so

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.210 
like that so
these<00:02:17.240> are<00:02:17.420> both<00:02:17.570> pretty<00:02:17.870> sturdy<00:02:18.170> and<00:02:18.440> now<00:02:19.160> you

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
these are both pretty sturdy and now you

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:25.270 
these are both pretty sturdy and now you
can<00:02:19.670> put<00:02:19.910> on<00:02:20.060> the<00:02:20.690> body<00:02:21.020> so<00:02:23.260> gotta<00:02:24.260> move<00:02:24.470> so<00:02:25.250> you

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
can put on the body so gotta move so you

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.730 
can put on the body so gotta move so you
got<00:02:25.580> to<00:02:25.700> line<00:02:25.820> it<00:02:25.850> up<00:02:26.060> and<00:02:26.270> the<00:02:26.630> body's<00:02:26.960> on<00:02:27.140> so

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:27.740 
got to line it up and the body's on so

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:41.490 
got to line it up and the body's on so
now<00:02:27.920> I<00:02:27.950> can<00:02:28.190> clip<00:02:28.520> it<00:02:28.670> let<00:02:29.090> these<00:02:30.280> Lego<00:02:31.280> spacers

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.540 

and<00:02:42.500> there<00:02:43.100> you<00:02:43.190> go

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:43.550 
and there you go

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:46.840 
and there you go
so<00:02:44.260> has<00:02:45.260> the<00:02:45.500> independent<00:02:45.980> suspension<00:02:46.580> and

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:46.850 
so has the independent suspension and

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:49.330 
so has the independent suspension and
now<00:02:47.690> that<00:02:47.930> it's<00:02:48.050> on<00:02:48.170> I<00:02:48.470> can<00:02:48.650> flip<00:02:48.920> it<00:02:48.950> upside

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
now that it's on I can flip it upside

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:52.930 
now that it's on I can flip it upside
down<00:02:49.370> and<00:02:50.050> show<00:02:51.050> you<00:02:51.110> the<00:02:51.230> features<00:02:51.940> the

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
down and show you the features the

00:02:52.940 --> 00:03:02.710 
down and show you the features the
four-wheel<00:02:53.360> drive<00:02:53.630> has<00:02:54.530> steering<00:03:01.239> so<00:03:02.239> there's

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:02.720 
four-wheel drive has steering so there's

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:04.780 
four-wheel drive has steering so there's
the<00:03:02.930> four-wheel<00:03:03.290> drive<00:03:03.500> in<00:03:03.650> the<00:03:03.709> steering<00:03:04.070> now

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790 
the four-wheel drive in the steering now

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:08.740 
the four-wheel drive in the steering now
we'll<00:03:05.200> flip<00:03:06.200> it<00:03:06.380> back<00:03:06.739> up<00:03:06.980> and<00:03:07.280> the<00:03:08.209> body<00:03:08.420> see

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750 
we'll flip it back up and the body see

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:11.320 
we'll flip it back up and the body see
through<00:03:08.989> so<00:03:09.320> I<00:03:09.350> set<00:03:09.739> up<00:03:09.770> a<00:03:09.950> course<00:03:10.220> of<00:03:10.489> sorters

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:11.330 
through so I set up a course of sorters

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:16.449 
through so I set up a course of sorters
over<00:03:11.720> here<00:03:12.160> so<00:03:13.160> where<00:03:13.340> it<00:03:13.730> can<00:03:15.459> demonstrate

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:16.459 
over here so where it can demonstrate

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:19.840 
over here so where it can demonstrate
some<00:03:17.800> some<00:03:18.800> of<00:03:18.890> the<00:03:18.950> torque<00:03:19.280> and<00:03:19.489> off-road

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:19.850 
some some of the torque and off-road

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:26.289 
some some of the torque and off-road
capability<00:03:20.600> that<00:03:20.900> it<00:03:21.080> has<00:03:21.290> so<00:03:25.209> sorry<00:03:26.209> about

00:03:26.289 --> 00:03:26.299 
capability that it has so sorry about

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:39.520 
capability that it has so sorry about
that<00:03:34.480> okay<00:03:35.480> and<00:03:37.660> yeah<00:03:38.660> I'm<00:03:38.840> driving<00:03:39.110> with<00:03:39.380> one

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:39.530 
that okay and yeah I'm driving with one

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:43.720 
that okay and yeah I'm driving with one
hand<00:03:39.590> so<00:03:39.950> kind<00:03:40.760> of<00:03:40.850> rough<00:03:40.970> it<00:03:42.280> I'll<00:03:43.280> Drive<00:03:43.580> it

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:43.730 
hand so kind of rough it I'll Drive it

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:54.670 
hand so kind of rough it I'll Drive it
back<00:03:51.760> so<00:03:52.760> there<00:03:53.269> you<00:03:53.360> go<00:03:53.510> sorry<00:03:54.230> about<00:03:54.350> the

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:58.630 
back so there you go sorry about the
little<00:03:55.489> complications<00:03:56.390> there<00:03:56.720> it<00:03:57.400> yeah<00:03:58.400> I<00:03:58.430> was

00:03:58.630 --> 00:03:58.640 
little complications there it yeah I was

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:59.949 
little complications there it yeah I was
driving<00:03:58.700> with<00:03:59.000> one<00:03:59.120> hand<00:03:59.180> so<00:03:59.570> it<00:03:59.630> was<00:03:59.780> a<00:03:59.810> little

00:03:59.949 --> 00:03:59.959 
driving with one hand so it was a little

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:02.170 
driving with one hand so it was a little
bit<00:04:00.110> rough<00:04:00.320> but<00:04:00.650> it<00:04:01.100> has<00:04:01.370> quite<00:04:01.850> a<00:04:01.880> bit<00:04:02.060> of

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:02.180 
bit rough but it has quite a bit of

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:03.940 
bit rough but it has quite a bit of
torque<00:04:02.420> as<00:04:02.630> you<00:04:02.750> can<00:04:02.870> see<00:04:03.140> it<00:04:03.350> easily<00:04:03.590> went

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:03.950 
torque as you can see it easily went

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:07.060 
torque as you can see it easily went
over<00:04:04.130> these<00:04:04.280> sorters<00:04:04.730> and<00:04:05.799> basically<00:04:06.799> yeah

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:07.070 
over these sorters and basically yeah

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:09.520 
over these sorters and basically yeah
it's<00:04:07.280> pretty<00:04:07.489> awesome<00:04:07.610> and<00:04:08.060> has<00:04:08.329> some<00:04:08.660> serious

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:09.530 
it's pretty awesome and has some serious

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:12.039 
it's pretty awesome and has some serious
off-road<00:04:10.100> capabilities<00:04:10.880> and<00:04:11.180> as<00:04:11.510> all<00:04:11.690> quite<00:04:12.019> a

00:04:12.039 --> 00:04:12.049 
off-road capabilities and as all quite a

00:04:12.049 --> 00:04:13.420 
off-road capabilities and as all quite a
bit<00:04:12.260> of<00:04:12.350> torque<00:04:12.590> thanks<00:04:12.920> to<00:04:13.010> the<00:04:13.070> Excel

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:13.430 
bit of torque thanks to the Excel

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:15.940 
bit of torque thanks to the Excel
loaders<00:04:13.760> as<00:04:13.940> well<00:04:14.150> so<00:04:14.810> it<00:04:15.500> can<00:04:15.560> drive<00:04:15.920> like

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:15.950 
loaders as well so it can drive like

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:18.580 
loaders as well so it can drive like
straight<00:04:16.669> up<00:04:16.700> a<00:04:17.060> wall<00:04:17.540> because<00:04:18.079> it<00:04:18.169> has<00:04:18.290> enough

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:18.590 
straight up a wall because it has enough

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:21.160 
straight up a wall because it has enough
torque<00:04:18.890> to<00:04:18.919> do<00:04:19.160> that

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:21.170 
torque to do that

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:30.460 
torque to do that
I<00:04:22.180> have<00:04:23.180> to<00:04:23.420> I<00:04:28.510> can<00:04:29.510> drive<00:04:29.930> straight<00:04:30.170> up<00:04:30.320> the

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:30.470 
I have to I can drive straight up the

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:33.370 
I have to I can drive straight up the
wall<00:04:30.620> but<00:04:31.310> the<00:04:31.790> body<00:04:32.030> was<00:04:32.390> interfering<00:04:33.230> with

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:33.380 
wall but the body was interfering with

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:36.670 
wall but the body was interfering with
it<00:04:33.560> so<00:04:33.950> that's<00:04:34.550> why<00:04:35.030> I<00:04:35.060> couldn't<00:04:35.630> do<00:04:35.900> it<00:04:36.050> right

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:36.680 
it so that's why I couldn't do it right

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:39.400 
it so that's why I couldn't do it right
well<00:04:37.010> but<00:04:37.400> it<00:04:38.090> does<00:04:38.300> have<00:04:38.510> a<00:04:38.540> lot<00:04:38.780> of<00:04:38.810> torque<00:04:39.170> as

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:39.410 
well but it does have a lot of torque as

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:41.080 
well but it does have a lot of torque as
you<00:04:39.620> can<00:04:39.770> see<00:04:39.980> the<00:04:40.280> four-wheel<00:04:40.610> drive<00:04:40.640> works

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:41.090 
you can see the four-wheel drive works

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:44.040 
you can see the four-wheel drive works
well<00:04:41.360> and<00:04:41.600> so<00:04:41.810> does<00:04:41.960> the<00:04:42.110> steering<00:04:42.530> and<00:04:43.190> yeah

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:44.050 
well and so does the steering and yeah

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:48.130 
well and so does the steering and yeah
so<00:04:45.050> it's<00:04:45.500> geared<00:04:46.370> up<00:04:46.520> and<00:04:46.760> works<00:04:47.570> really<00:04:47.870> well

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:48.140 
so it's geared up and works really well

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:50.290 
so it's geared up and works really well
so<00:04:48.560> if<00:04:49.040> we<00:04:49.190> guys<00:04:49.400> enjoyed<00:04:49.730> this<00:04:49.880> video
