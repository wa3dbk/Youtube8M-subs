00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:10.459 
basically showing it what it looks like

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:13.540 
basically showing it what it looks like
this<00:03:11.030> whole<00:03:11.330> area<00:03:11.750> right<00:03:11.900> here<00:03:12.370> only<00:03:13.370> this

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:13.550 
this whole area right here only this

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:17.170 
this whole area right here only this
part<00:03:14.019> only<00:03:15.019> this<00:03:15.380> black<00:03:15.709> part<00:03:16.010> right<00:03:16.130> here<00:03:16.180> is

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.180 
part only this black part right here is

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:18.970 
part only this black part right here is
aluminum<00:03:17.720> so<00:03:18.440> if<00:03:18.500> you're<00:03:18.620> thinking<00:03:18.680> this

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:18.980 
aluminum so if you're thinking this

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:22.420 
aluminum so if you're thinking this
whole<00:03:19.130> thing<00:03:19.400> is<00:03:19.549> a<00:03:19.579> Luminum<00:03:21.010> TPU<00:03:22.010> case<00:03:22.220> it

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:22.430 
whole thing is a Luminum TPU case it

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:28.660 
whole thing is a Luminum TPU case it
isn't<00:03:23.410> the<00:03:24.410> edges<00:03:24.829> are<00:03:24.950> plastic<00:03:25.579> I<00:03:27.670> think

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:28.670 
isn't the edges are plastic I think

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:31.810 
isn't the edges are plastic I think
that's<00:03:28.790> to<00:03:29.000> keep<00:03:29.480> it<00:03:29.600> nice<00:03:29.720> and<00:03:29.780> light<00:03:30.730> it's<00:03:31.730> a

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:31.820 
that's to keep it nice and light it's a

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:34.300 
that's to keep it nice and light it's a
little<00:03:32.000> bit<00:03:32.090> heavy<00:03:32.299> but<00:03:32.540> the<00:03:33.410> nexus<00:03:33.709> 7<00:03:33.980> itself

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:34.310 
little bit heavy but the nexus 7 itself

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:39.420 
little bit heavy but the nexus 7 itself
is<00:03:34.549> light<00:03:35.030> enough<00:03:35.060> to<00:03:35.540> the<00:03:35.780> point<00:03:36.019> where<00:03:37.180> it's

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 
is light enough to the point where it's

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:42.970 
is light enough to the point where it's
it<00:03:40.430> doesn't<00:03:40.610> feel<00:03:41.000> tough<00:03:41.660> like<00:03:41.870> you<00:03:42.829> don't

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:42.980 
it doesn't feel tough like you don't

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:46.410 
it doesn't feel tough like you don't
feel<00:03:43.130> comfortable<00:03:43.160> holding<00:03:43.790> it<00:03:44.060> I<00:03:44.239> just<00:03:44.870> don't

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:46.420 
feel comfortable holding it I just don't

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:51.729 
feel comfortable holding it I just don't
so<00:03:47.420> um<00:03:47.660> I<00:03:48.790> think<00:03:49.790> that's<00:03:50.150> just<00:03:50.510> about<00:03:50.600> it<00:03:50.780> also

00:03:51.729 --> 00:03:51.739 
so um I think that's just about it also

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:54.370 
so um I think that's just about it also
