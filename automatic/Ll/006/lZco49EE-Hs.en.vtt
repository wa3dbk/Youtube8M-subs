out misinformation about climate change

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:36.109 
out misinformation about climate change
there's<00:01:33.869> a<00:01:33.929> kind<00:01:34.110> of<00:01:34.229> money<00:01:34.530> pollution<00:01:35.310> in<00:01:35.490> our

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
there's a kind of money pollution in our

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.150 
there's a kind of money pollution in our
system<00:01:36.720> that's<00:01:36.750> as<00:01:37.080> Grievous<00:01:37.410> is<00:01:37.770> every<00:01:38.039> other

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
kind of pollution and so we have to

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.339 
kind of pollution and so we have to
expose<00:01:40.530> that<00:01:40.590> we<00:01:41.190> need<00:01:41.399> the<00:01:41.610> big<00:01:41.970> broad<00:01:42.690> social

around<00:01:49.500> the<00:01:49.890> world<00:01:50.099> and<00:01:50.420> we're<00:01:51.420> only

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
around the world and we're only

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.930 
around the world and we're only
beginning<00:01:52.259> to<00:01:52.860> sense<00:01:53.130> that<00:01:53.340> that<00:01:53.520> might<00:01:53.729> be

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:53.940 
beginning to sense that that might be

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:56.359 
beginning to sense that that might be
possible<00:01:54.349> so<00:01:55.349> how<00:01:55.530> do<00:01:55.590> we<00:01:55.709> do<00:01:55.890> that<00:01:55.920> how<00:01:56.099> do<00:01:56.250> we

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
possible so how do we do that how do we

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.699 
possible so how do we do that how do we
make<00:01:56.520> that<00:01:56.640> transformation<00:01:57.119> and<00:01:57.660> it's<00:01:58.619> not

00:01:58.699 --> 00:01:58.709 
make that transformation and it's not

00:01:58.709 --> 00:02:00.800 
make that transformation and it's not
hard<00:01:58.950> to<00:01:59.069> imagine<00:01:59.190> an<00:01:59.819> alternative<00:02:00.420> energy

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
hard to imagine an alternative energy

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.479 
hard to imagine an alternative energy
system<00:02:01.229> the<00:02:01.619> world<00:02:01.800> has<00:02:02.009> gone<00:02:02.250> through

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:02.489 
system the world has gone through

00:02:02.489 --> 00:02:04.669 
system the world has gone through
technological<00:02:02.840> transformations<00:02:03.840> before<00:02:04.259> we

00:02:04.669 --> 00:02:04.679 
technological transformations before we

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:06.740 
technological transformations before we
didn't<00:02:04.890> always<00:02:05.069> use<00:02:05.340> fossil<00:02:05.640> fuels<00:02:06.090> we<00:02:06.539> didn't

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
didn't always use fossil fuels we didn't

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.449 
didn't always use fossil fuels we didn't
always<00:02:06.929> use<00:02:07.200> oil<00:02:07.440> and<00:02:07.590> gas<00:02:07.709> so<00:02:07.979> we<00:02:08.099> know<00:02:08.280> what

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
always use oil and gas so we know what

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.130 
always use oil and gas so we know what
technological<00:02:08.789> transformation<00:02:09.270> looks<00:02:09.929> like

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
technological transformation looks like
