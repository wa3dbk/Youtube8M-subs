in button all right now navigate down to
change<00:00:32.640> filament<00:00:33.410> and<00:00:34.410> then<00:00:38.930> buttons<00:00:39.930> are

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
change filament and then buttons are

change filament and then buttons are
pretty<00:00:40.110> sensitive<00:00:40.969> I'm<00:00:41.969> gonna<00:00:42.180> go<00:00:42.239> down<00:00:42.420> to

00:00:42.819 --> 00:00:42.829 
pretty sensitive I'm gonna go down to

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:47.119 
pretty sensitive I'm gonna go down to
unload<00:00:45.500> and<00:00:46.500> it's<00:00:46.680> going<00:00:46.829> to<00:00:46.890> heat<00:00:47.010> the

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
unload and it's going to heat the

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.090 
unload and it's going to heat the
extruder

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:51.100 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:01:00.500 

so<00:00:51.640> wait<00:00:52.239> till<00:00:52.480> that's

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.730 

so<00:01:01.510> once<00:01:01.810> it's<00:01:03.330> heated<00:01:04.330> up<00:01:04.600> you<00:01:04.900> pull<00:01:05.230> off<00:01:05.440> this

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:05.740 
so once it's heated up you pull off this

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:08.580 
so once it's heated up you pull off this
tube

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:08.590 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:10.069
