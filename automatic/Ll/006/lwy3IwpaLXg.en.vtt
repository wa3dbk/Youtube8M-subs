that see me try so there's actually a
great<00:01:16.229> concept<00:01:16.710> in<00:01:16.890> here<00:01:17.130> my<00:01:17.700> first<00:01:17.970> voice

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
great concept in here my first voice

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.180 
great concept in here my first voice
images<00:01:18.570> example<00:01:18.960> number<00:01:19.080> a<00:01:19.380> they're<00:01:20.070> gonna

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:20.190 
images example number a they're gonna

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:21.410

say<00:01:20.370> up<00:01:20.460> there<00:01:20.580> as<00:01:20.700> if<00:01:20.790> a<00:01:20.820> little<00:01:21.090> once<00:01:21.270> you

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
say up there as if a little once you

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.990 
say up there as if a little once you
think<00:01:22.010> is<00:01:23.010> each<00:01:23.370> of<00:01:23.549> the<00:01:23.610> notes<00:01:23.790> you're<00:01:23.940> going

we do big voicings of it and still get
the<00:03:44.720> same<00:03:44.930> idea<00:03:45.050> so<00:03:45.500> once<00:03:45.680> again<00:03:45.770> the<00:03:45.980> concept

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:46.400 
the same idea so once again the concept

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.850 
the same idea so once again the concept

00:03:59.230 --> 00:03:59.240 
notes move down chromatically and if i

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:01.510 
notes move down chromatically and if i
do<00:03:59.300> not<00:03:59.600> have<00:03:59.780> any<00:04:00.020> of<00:04:00.110> the<00:04:00.200> voicing<00:04:00.650> in<00:04:01.370> this

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:01.520 
do not have any of the voicing in this

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:02.560 
do not have any of the voicing in this
case<00:04:01.730> like<00:04:01.910> you<00:04:02.000> example<00:04:02.270> number<00:04:02.360> two

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:02.570 
case like you example number two

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:03.820 
case like you example number two
everything<00:04:03.290> moves<00:04:03.470> down<00:04:03.620> chromatically

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:03.830 
everything moves down chromatically

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:08.340 
everything moves down chromatically
until<00:04:04.820> i<00:04:04.880> forget<00:04:05.060> to<00:04:05.180> the<00:04:05.240> resolution<00:04:05.720> again

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:08.350 
until i forget to the resolution again

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:10.420 
until i forget to the resolution again
so<00:04:09.350> once<00:04:09.470> again<00:04:09.560> you<00:04:09.740> can<00:04:09.860> get<00:04:09.950> all<00:04:10.070> this<00:04:10.190> at<00:04:10.340> my
