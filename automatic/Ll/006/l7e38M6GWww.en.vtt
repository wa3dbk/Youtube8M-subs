to talk a little about granite we start
out<00:00:29.220> with<00:00:29.340> a<00:00:29.460> group<00:00:29.670> a<00:00:29.820> granite<00:00:30.300> and<00:00:30.449> group<00:00:30.960> a

movement and throughout them and they
don't<00:01:43.110> look<00:01:43.259> the<00:01:43.409> same<00:01:43.439> all<00:01:43.829> the<00:01:43.860> way<00:01:43.950> through

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:44.479 
don't look the same all the way through

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:46.730 
don't look the same all the way through
kind<00:01:45.479> of<00:01:45.540> look<00:01:45.630> like<00:01:45.659> marbles<00:01:46.290> some<00:01:46.470> of<00:01:46.619> them

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
kind of look like marbles some of them

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.010 
kind of look like marbles some of them
but<00:01:47.549> that's<00:01:48.030> where<00:01:48.299> we<00:01:48.360> go<00:01:48.479> with<00:01:48.630> granite<00:01:48.930> now

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
but that's where we go with granite now

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.789 
but that's where we go with granite now
granite<00:01:49.439> is<00:01:49.560> definitely<00:01:50.070> more<00:01:50.280> porous

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:51.799 
granite is definitely more porous

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:53.929 
granite is definitely more porous
sometimes<00:01:52.799> you<00:01:52.920> can<00:01:53.070> rub<00:01:53.280> your<00:01:53.310> hand<00:01:53.640> over<00:01:53.790> a

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
sometimes you can rub your hand over a

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.999 
sometimes you can rub your hand over a
piece<00:01:54.210> of<00:01:54.420> stone<00:01:54.689> and<00:01:55.350> you<00:01:55.470> can<00:01:55.649> feel<00:01:55.979> that

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
piece of stone and you can feel that

before they chose it so make sure when
you're<00:02:18.629> looking<00:02:18.870> at<00:02:18.989> granite<00:02:19.410> not<00:02:19.980> only<00:02:20.220> do

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
you're looking at granite not only do

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.130 
you're looking at granite not only do
you<00:02:20.520> look<00:02:20.670> at<00:02:20.879> it<00:02:21.030> but<00:02:21.120> you<00:02:21.180> feel<00:02:21.569> the<00:02:21.750> texture

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
you look at it but you feel the texture

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:23.510 
you look at it but you feel the texture
of<00:02:22.290> it<00:02:22.440> and<00:02:22.620> make<00:02:22.770> sure<00:02:22.950> you're<00:02:23.099> good<00:02:23.340> with

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
of it and make sure you're good with

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.619 
of it and make sure you're good with
that<00:02:23.750> now<00:02:24.860> when<00:02:25.860> you're<00:02:26.010> choosing

00:02:26.619 --> 00:02:26.629 
that now when you're choosing

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:28.490 
that now when you're choosing
countertops<00:02:27.629> you're<00:02:27.810> also<00:02:27.930> gonna<00:02:28.140> have<00:02:28.349> to

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
countertops you're also gonna have to

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.559 
countertops you're also gonna have to
choose<00:02:28.739> an<00:02:29.040> edge<00:02:29.640> that<00:02:29.879> goes<00:02:30.060> with<00:02:30.360> it

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:30.569 
choose an edge that goes with it

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:33.080 
choose an edge that goes with it
there<00:02:30.930> are<00:02:31.050> usually<00:02:31.230> several<00:02:32.040> standard<00:02:32.700> edges

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
there are usually several standard edges

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.960 
there are usually several standard edges
like<00:02:33.300> a<00:02:33.330> bulldoze<00:02:33.870> and<00:02:34.769> a<00:02:34.890> bevel<00:02:35.250> edge<00:02:35.400> which

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
like a bulldoze and a bevel edge which

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.860 
like a bulldoze and a bevel edge which
has<00:02:36.180> a<00:02:36.209> sharp<00:02:36.629> cut<00:02:36.930> on<00:02:37.110> it<00:02:37.340> so<00:02:38.599> those<00:02:39.599> are

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
has a sharp cut on it so those are

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:43.900 
has a sharp cut on it so those are
staying<00:02:40.140> edges<00:02:40.970> you<00:02:41.970> can<00:02:42.000> also<00:02:42.239> upgrade<00:02:42.599> to

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:43.910 
staying edges you can also upgrade to

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:47.000 
staying edges you can also upgrade to
these<00:02:44.910> edges<00:02:45.330> here<00:02:45.720> that<00:02:46.349> have<00:02:46.590> different

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
these edges here that have different

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:48.949 
these edges here that have different
bevel<00:02:47.400> cuts<00:02:47.700> in<00:02:47.879> them<00:02:48.030> this<00:02:48.180> is<00:02:48.239> an<00:02:48.480> ogee<00:02:48.930> edge

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
bevel cuts in them this is an ogee edge

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:52.040 
bevel cuts in them this is an ogee edge
these<00:02:49.739> typically<00:02:50.160> are<00:02:50.360> charged<00:02:51.360> per<00:02:51.720> linear

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050 
these typically are charged per linear

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:54.680 
these typically are charged per linear
foot<00:02:52.170> as<00:02:52.560> they<00:02:52.769> cut<00:02:52.980> it<00:02:53.099> in<00:02:53.220> the<00:02:53.310> top<00:02:53.519> so<00:02:54.209> the

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
foot as they cut it in the top so the

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:57.830 
foot as they cut it in the top so the
price<00:02:54.959> can<00:02:55.200> go<00:02:55.349> up<00:02:55.560> from<00:02:56.190> that<00:02:56.340> point<00:02:56.700> but<00:02:57.690> when

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
price can go up from that point but when

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.930 
price can go up from that point but when
you<00:02:57.930> go<00:02:58.080> look<00:02:58.290> at<00:02:58.409> granite<00:02:58.860> you'll<00:02:59.610> go<00:02:59.790> to<00:02:59.849> a

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 
have to do any service to it and it's

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.410 
have to do any service to it and it's
just<00:04:06.330> like<00:04:06.569> granite<00:04:07.019> as<00:04:07.950> with<00:04:08.280> granite<00:04:08.790> you

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:09.420 
just like granite as with granite you

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:11.960 
just like granite as with granite you
have<00:04:09.629> to<00:04:09.780> have<00:04:09.959> it<00:04:10.310> templated<00:04:11.310> and<00:04:11.610> an<00:04:11.790> edge

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:11.970 
have to have it templated and an edge

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:14.270 
have to have it templated and an edge
cut<00:04:12.390> into<00:04:12.720> it<00:04:12.870> and<00:04:12.989> the<00:04:13.560> sink<00:04:13.890> that<00:04:14.129> you're

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280 
cut into it and the sink that you're

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:14.740 
cut into it and the sink that you're
going<00:04:14.430> to<00:04:14.459> get

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:14.750 
going to get

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:17.229 
going to get
would<00:04:14.840> be<00:04:14.960> an<00:04:15.080> undermount<00:04:15.530> sink<00:04:16.070> so<00:04:16.790> the<00:04:16.970> sink

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:17.239 
would be an undermount sink so the sink

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:19.449 
would be an undermount sink so the sink
is<00:04:17.359> always<00:04:17.630> going<00:04:17.780> to<00:04:17.840> be<00:04:17.900> separate<00:04:18.410> then<00:04:19.190> the

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:19.459 
is always going to be separate then the

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:20.789 
is always going to be separate then the

Cambria they're rather new but they've

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:29.490 
Cambria they're rather new but they've

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:29.500 
devised a method of making their stones

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:32.890 
devised a method of making their stones
look<00:04:30.500> more<00:04:30.740> natural<00:04:31.400> with<00:04:32.030> different<00:04:32.540> kinds

of<00:04:33.020> movement<00:04:33.530> in<00:04:33.650> them<00:04:33.830> they<00:04:34.340> don't<00:04:34.490> look<00:04:34.700> like

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:34.760 
of movement in them they don't look like

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:46.570

have somewhat movement Salle stones also

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:57.850 
have somewhat movement Salle stones also
come<00:04:56.570> out<00:04:56.660> with<00:04:56.810> some<00:04:56.990> new<00:04:57.140> colors<00:04:57.500> that<00:04:57.530> have

come out with some new colors that have

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:00.940 
come out with some new colors that have
this<00:04:58.070> same<00:04:58.790> type<00:04:59.090> of<00:04:59.120> movement<00:04:59.620> now<00:05:00.620> the<00:05:00.710> thing

about<00:05:01.270> quartz<00:05:02.270> is<00:05:02.450> it<00:05:02.720> is<00:05:02.870> definitely<00:05:03.460> more

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:04.460 
about quartz is it is definitely more

about quartz is it is definitely more

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:24.490 
commercial applications and now they've

00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:27.359 
commercial applications and now they've
got<00:07:24.699> some<00:07:24.939> new<00:07:25.089> edges<00:07:25.539> that<00:07:25.990> you<00:07:26.050> can<00:07:26.379> use<00:07:26.649> on

got some new edges that you can use on

00:07:27.369 --> 00:07:29.639 
got some new edges that you can use on
laminates<00:07:27.969> too<00:07:28.240> so<00:07:28.599> you<00:07:28.689> can<00:07:28.869> get<00:07:29.050> more<00:07:29.289> of<00:07:29.469> a

00:07:29.639 --> 00:07:29.649 
laminates too so you can get more of a

00:07:29.649 --> 00:07:31.559 
laminates too so you can get more of a
natural<00:07:30.490> look<00:07:30.639> at<00:07:30.819> it<00:07:30.969> and<00:07:31.119> they<00:07:31.180> do<00:07:31.360> have<00:07:31.509> a

00:07:31.559 --> 00:07:31.569 
natural look at it and they do have a

00:07:31.569 --> 00:07:35.670 
natural look at it and they do have a
bull<00:07:31.809> nose<00:07:32.019> and<00:07:32.409> a<00:07:32.919> bevel<00:07:33.279> so<00:07:34.180> if<00:07:34.479> budget<00:07:35.469> is<00:07:35.649> a

00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:35.680 
bull nose and a bevel so if budget is a

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:38.339 
bull nose and a bevel so if budget is a
big<00:07:35.979> consideration<00:07:36.539> then<00:07:37.539> you<00:07:37.839> might<00:07:38.019> want<00:07:38.289> to

00:07:38.339 --> 00:07:38.349 
big consideration then you might want to

00:07:38.349 --> 00:07:40.439 
big consideration then you might want to
consider<00:07:38.680> using<00:07:38.829> laminate<00:07:39.550> countertops<00:07:40.119> that

00:07:40.439 --> 00:07:40.449 
consider using laminate countertops that

00:07:40.449 --> 00:07:42.649 
consider using laminate countertops that
would<00:07:40.599> be<00:07:40.719> the<00:07:40.839> starting<00:07:41.229> point<00:07:41.499> then<00:07:42.129> granite

00:07:42.649 --> 00:07:42.659 
would be the starting point then granite

00:07:42.659 --> 00:07:48.509 
would be the starting point then granite
then<00:07:43.659> ports<00:07:44.409> and<00:07:45.779> chorion<00:07:46.779> so<00:07:47.469> I<00:07:47.800> hope<00:07:48.279> I've

00:07:48.509 --> 00:07:48.519 
then ports and chorion so I hope I've

00:07:48.519 --> 00:07:50.100 
then ports and chorion so I hope I've
told<00:07:48.909> you<00:07:49.059> something<00:07:49.449> you<00:07:49.599> needed<00:07:49.749> to<00:07:49.899> hear
