 physically and in video 29 on the 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.460
 worst sequences of the gaming world not 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.230
 is bad when a company launches a 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.020
 game that does not give height of the predecessor 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.210
 because it is but and when the company 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:21.449
 just pick it up and step on the shit and 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.070
 He launched such a game and the series to the lot 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.789
 times is canceled or ends up entering 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.220
 crisis 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:30.630
 I'll tell you about the games in this video. 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:33.690
 kind of starting now for our first 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.790
 Today's game is dragon age 2 largest 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.790
 had practically settled on everything with 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.800
 the dragon and original there in the sequence she 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.079
 decided to do what companies 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.780
 they should never do what it is to make the game 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:48.030
 more accessible to all audiences 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.469
 also known as let's carry 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.170
 completely the game 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:54.870
 they switched the gameplay with the biggest 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.539
 in action instead of rpg have taken a world 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:00.510
 open the game the story gets to be 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:02.850
 good but still not so good 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.700
 account of the original game and at the 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:08.340
 accounts we had things will be very 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.740
 has even made death threats to 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.869
 writer of the itaÃº group do this you 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.040
 they will like the club does not threaten anyone 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.159
 of death one year 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.780
 the conference went well for me 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.270
 the next game our list is great and 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.820
 You end up with this name 2012 and 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.560
 until then almost three years later 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.990
 we had no numbered chapter of the 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.100
 frank resident gol thanks to crap 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.110
 that they had the example they 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.630
 invested in the cinnamon money tried 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.430
 make a game that would please all 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.860
 potential audiences who enjoy 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.020
 receptive and after all is a game 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.610
 that does not please anyone because part of 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.680
 suspense is not so good 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.780
 the gameplay of the action completed 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.720
 It seems more like a warrior is made in the 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:52.030
 and from the day it is a mixture 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:54.790
 of the two that really is 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:57.070
 the same pointed out an unfortunate injury 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:58.780
 who studies and has almost failed so much that she 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:02.560
 same way your legs today in 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:05.710
 day thanks to this title the third game 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:08.380
 on our list is 63 shit a 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:11.410
 sensational franchise as space pulling 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:13.720
 all terror and focusing on action is 63 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:17.080
 was more a game type that the two dragon 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:19.840
 tried to be accessible to a larger audience 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:22.810
 and such is the visceral response to 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:26.560
 this was taking the terror the terror is not 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:28.209
 remember but finally take the terror and do 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.560
 a sequence of rooms playing a 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:30.910
 where you have to kill the 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:34.450
 monsters live appearing straight 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:36.250
 and honestly with the shit I never 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.440
 I managed to finish it so bad that it is 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:40.450
 and I really hope the franchise 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:42.370
 return one day to her original roots 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:44.050
 leaving our list for today we have 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:46.810
 than who ever 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:49.450
 The game took years and years and years and years. 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:51.760
 and more years to come out at the end of 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:54.010
 accounts had an archaic gameplay 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:57.160
 aged has actually been conceived 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:59.049
 It was not modernized and at the end of 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:01.390
 accounts the only cool thing that came in the 

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:03.820
 game was're alone than the look that 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:06.190
 I was coming in his collector's edition myself. 

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:09.420
 I have this statue it is beautiful and I do not 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:11.890
 I have the game because it's not worth the 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:15.549
 Actually, he can buy it nowadays. 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:17.950

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:20.260
