for<00:00:02.700> generations<00:00:03.330> we<00:00:03.990> dreamed<00:00:04.440> about<00:00:04.620> a<00:00:04.799> place

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:04.920 
for generations we dreamed about a place

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.720 
for generations we dreamed about a place
to<00:00:05.549> live<00:00:05.850> and<00:00:06.180> work<00:00:06.450> in<00:00:06.690> space<00:00:07.200> a<00:00:07.470> place<00:00:08.400> where

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
to live and work in space a place where

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.450 
to live and work in space a place where
life<00:00:08.970> up<00:00:09.179> there<00:00:09.540> would<00:00:10.170> benefit<00:00:10.679> life<00:00:10.920> down

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460

00:01:07.529 --> 00:01:07.539 
in so much pain I went for my first MRI

00:01:07.539 --> 00:01:09.930 
in so much pain I went for my first MRI
and<00:01:08.020> then<00:01:08.170> it<00:01:08.350> showed<00:01:08.560> up<00:01:08.710> with<00:01:08.890> like<00:01:09.130> hundreds

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:09.940 
and then it showed up with like hundreds

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:14.430 
and then it showed up with like hundreds
of<00:01:10.090> tumors<00:01:10.539> all<00:01:10.929> over<00:01:10.979> and<00:01:12.690> then<00:01:13.690> they<00:01:14.050> sent<00:01:14.380> me

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:14.440 
of tumors all over and then they sent me

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.520 
of tumors all over and then they sent me

a<00:01:46.080> long<00:01:47.070> time<00:01:47.370> ago<00:01:47.640> when<00:01:47.790> we<00:01:47.909> were<00:01:48.090> thinking

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
a long time ago when we were thinking

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.960 
a long time ago when we were thinking
about<00:01:48.510> this<00:01:48.900> we<00:01:48.960> approached<00:01:49.970> MacDonald

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
about this we approached MacDonald

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.420 
about this we approached MacDonald
Dettwiler<00:01:51.119> associates<00:01:51.990> it's<00:01:52.590> a<00:01:52.680> company<00:01:53.190> that

Dettwiler associates it's a company that
happens<00:01:53.729> to<00:01:53.970> be<00:01:54.060> located<00:01:54.180> in<00:01:54.600> Canada<00:01:54.810> that

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
happens to be located in Canada that

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.149 
happens to be located in Canada that
built<00:01:56.150> robots<00:01:57.150> for<00:01:57.690> space<00:01:57.869> they<00:01:58.710> built<00:01:58.979> what

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
built robots for space they built what

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:02.410 
built robots for space they built what
Canadians<00:01:59.940> called<00:02:00.210> Canada<00:02:00.690> and<00:02:01.070> then<00:02:02.070> they

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.420 
Canadians called Canada and then they

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.330 
Canadians called Canada and then they
constructed<00:02:03.420> the<00:02:04.140> special<00:02:04.680> purpose<00:02:04.979> dextrous

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
constructed the special purpose dextrous

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.160 
constructed the special purpose dextrous
manipulator<00:02:05.490> for<00:02:06.390> the<00:02:06.479> international<00:02:06.990> space

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
manipulator for the international space

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.690 
manipulator for the international space
station<00:02:07.369> and<00:02:08.369> the<00:02:09.209> idea<00:02:09.720> was<00:02:10.020> if<00:02:10.489> they<00:02:11.489> could

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
station and the idea was if they could

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.870 
station and the idea was if they could
build<00:02:11.850> such<00:02:12.209> complex<00:02:12.720> robots<00:02:13.550> perhaps<00:02:14.550> in

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
build such complex robots perhaps in

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:16.790 
build such complex robots perhaps in
collaboration<00:02:15.510> with<00:02:15.540> medicine<00:02:16.080> we<00:02:16.620> could

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
collaboration with medicine we could

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.220 
collaboration with medicine we could
build<00:02:16.920> a<00:02:17.069> robot<00:02:17.400> that<00:02:18.120> could<00:02:18.300> operate<00:02:18.660> inside

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
build a robot that could operate inside

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:24.440 
build a robot that could operate inside
an<00:02:19.530> MRI<00:02:19.860> machine<00:02:22.459> we<00:02:23.459> did<00:02:23.670> not<00:02:23.850> realize<00:02:24.180> that

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
an MRI machine we did not realize that

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:29.840 
an MRI machine we did not realize that
it<00:02:24.930> was<00:02:25.670> built<00:02:26.670> on<00:02:26.820> the<00:02:27.060> same<00:02:27.620> material<00:02:28.620> as<00:02:29.280> the

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
it was built on the same material as the

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:33.259 
it was built on the same material as the
space<00:02:30.239> arm<00:02:30.540> and<00:02:31.400> we're<00:02:32.400> quite<00:02:32.519> amazed<00:02:32.910> that<00:02:33.150> if

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:33.269 
space arm and we're quite amazed that if

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:35.570 
space arm and we're quite amazed that if
that's<00:02:33.480> what<00:02:33.900> he<00:02:34.500> had<00:02:34.590> made<00:02:34.800> it<00:02:34.980> out<00:02:35.100> of

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
that's what he had made it out of

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.759 
that's what he had made it out of
but<00:02:36.180> it's<00:02:36.390> the<00:02:36.570> multi<00:02:37.019> dexterity<00:02:37.620> of<00:02:37.680> the

00:02:37.759 --> 00:02:37.769 
but it's the multi dexterity of the

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:40.880 
but it's the multi dexterity of the
robot<00:02:38.040> and<00:02:38.310> that<00:02:39.150> that<00:02:39.390> robot<00:02:39.840> could<00:02:40.800> have

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
robot and that that robot could have

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.820 
robot and that that robot could have
performed<00:02:41.280> tasks<00:02:41.790> that<00:02:42.030> made<00:02:42.300> us<00:02:42.830> become

hope that it helps people who need
surgery<00:04:07.540> in<00:04:07.780> the<00:04:07.930> future<00:04:09.180> if<00:04:10.180> they're<00:04:10.480> ever

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:10.630 
surgery in the future if they're ever

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:13.080 
surgery in the future if they're ever
propositioned<00:04:11.530> with<00:04:11.709> a<00:04:11.950> chance<00:04:12.250> in<00:04:12.610> the

I<00:04:15.310> hope<00:04:15.459> they<00:04:15.610> take<00:04:15.640> it
