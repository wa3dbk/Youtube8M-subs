00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:03.179 
Wow it's funny it's funny and keep

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:05.360 
Wow it's funny it's funny and keep
getting<00:00:03.510> emails<00:00:03.659> codes<00:00:04.290> where<00:00:04.799> you<00:00:04.920> may<00:00:05.130> make

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:05.370 
getting emails codes where you may make

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.660 
getting emails codes where you may make
my<00:00:05.580> hand<00:00:05.819> stronger<00:00:06.420> real<00:00:07.379> simple<00:00:07.740> if<00:00:08.160> you

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:08.670 
my hand stronger real simple if you

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:10.700 
my hand stronger real simple if you
can't<00:00:09.000> grip<00:00:09.420> the<00:00:09.599> basketball<00:00:10.320> you're<00:00:10.530> not

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
can't grip the basketball you're not

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.789 
can't grip the basketball you're not
going<00:00:10.920> to<00:00:10.980> be<00:00:11.130> able<00:00:11.160> to<00:00:11.400> dump<00:00:11.639> the<00:00:11.880> basketball

00:00:12.789 --> 00:00:12.799 
going to be able to dump the basketball

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:15.770 
going to be able to dump the basketball
so<00:00:13.799> learn<00:00:14.070> how<00:00:14.309> to<00:00:14.370> strengthen<00:00:14.759> every<00:00:15.389> digit

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
so learn how to strengthen every digit

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.410 
so learn how to strengthen every digit
in<00:00:15.900> your<00:00:16.080> hand<00:00:16.350> I<00:00:16.800> have<00:00:17.250> a<00:00:17.310> whole<00:00:17.550> protocol<00:00:18.180> for

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
in your hand I have a whole protocol for

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.800 
in your hand I have a whole protocol for
that<00:00:18.600> when<00:00:19.140> you<00:00:19.260> read<00:00:19.470> it<00:00:19.500> you<00:00:19.619> let<00:00:19.859> me<00:00:19.920> know

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:20.810 
that when you read it you let me know

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:23.720 
that when you read it you let me know
next<00:00:21.810> what's<00:00:22.350> the<00:00:22.500> difference<00:00:22.710> between<00:00:23.039> fast

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
next what's the difference between fast

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.779 
next what's the difference between fast
twitch<00:00:24.210> and<00:00:24.420> slow<00:00:24.689> to<00:00:24.750> its<00:00:25.050> fibers<00:00:25.609> you<00:00:26.609> don't

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
twitch and slow to its fibers you don't

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.330 
twitch and slow to its fibers you don't
really<00:00:26.970> need<00:00:27.240> to<00:00:27.390> get<00:00:27.510> that<00:00:27.720> technical<00:00:28.410> but

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
really need to get that technical but

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.720 
really need to get that technical but
the<00:00:29.519> technical<00:00:30.210> piece<00:00:30.960> is<00:00:31.349> that<00:00:31.920> fast-twitch

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
the technical piece is that fast-twitch

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.630 
the technical piece is that fast-twitch
fibers<00:00:32.840> fire<00:00:33.840> faster<00:00:34.800> than<00:00:35.010> slow<00:00:35.309> twitch

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
fibers fire faster than slow twitch

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.090 
fibers fire faster than slow twitch
fibers<00:00:36.260> so<00:00:37.260> it's<00:00:37.829> the<00:00:38.070> fast<00:00:38.370> twitch<00:00:38.850> fibers<00:00:39.510> in

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:40.100 
fibers so it's the fast twitch fibers in

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.830 
fibers so it's the fast twitch fibers in
conjunction<00:00:41.100> with<00:00:41.250> the<00:00:41.579> slow<00:00:41.879> twitch<00:00:42.270> fibers

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
conjunction with the slow twitch fibers

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.770 
conjunction with the slow twitch fibers
that<00:00:43.050> helps<00:00:43.379> a<00:00:43.500> person<00:00:43.680> ryan<00:00:44.219> or<00:00:44.670> jump<00:00:45.059> in<00:00:45.390> this

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
that helps a person ryan or jump in this

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.670 
that helps a person ryan or jump in this
case<00:00:46.489> what<00:00:47.539> active<00:00:48.539> isolated<00:00:49.170> stretching

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
case what active isolated stretching

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.330 
case what active isolated stretching
does<00:00:49.890> is<00:00:50.160> it<00:00:50.370> coordinates<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:51.690> true<00:00:52.340> so

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
does is it coordinates the true so

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.750 
does is it coordinates the true so
you're<00:00:54.090> not<00:00:54.300> going<00:00:54.600> to<00:00:54.719> lose<00:00:54.989> anything<00:00:55.760> from

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
you're not going to lose anything from

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.880 
you're not going to lose anything from
working<00:00:57.180> your<00:00:57.329> slow<00:00:57.600> twitch<00:00:57.899> fibers<00:00:58.440> which<00:00:58.680> is

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
working your slow twitch fibers which is

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.740 
working your slow twitch fibers which is
moving<00:00:59.370> a<00:00:59.609> muscle<00:00:59.850> through<00:01:00.300> a<00:01:00.359> range<00:01:00.570> of

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
moving a muscle through a range of

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.319 
moving a muscle through a range of
motion<00:01:01.170> against<00:01:01.559> resistance<00:01:01.949> and<00:01:02.399> you're<00:01:03.149> not

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
motion against resistance and you're not

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.600 
motion against resistance and you're not
going<00:01:03.570> to<00:01:03.690> lose<00:01:03.870> anything<00:01:04.290> from<00:01:04.860> learning<00:01:05.430> how

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
going to lose anything from learning how

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.530 
going to lose anything from learning how
to<00:01:05.670> do<00:01:05.970> explosive<00:01:06.750> plyometric<00:01:07.560> type<00:01:07.799> jumping

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:08.540 
to do explosive plyometric type jumping

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:14.770 
to do explosive plyometric type jumping
what<00:01:09.540> you<00:01:09.720> lose<00:01:10.020> is<00:01:11.299> actually<00:01:12.299> when<00:01:12.869> you<00:01:12.900> don't

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:14.780 
what you lose is actually when you don't

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:17.450 
what you lose is actually when you don't
synchronize<00:01:15.780> the<00:01:16.229> true<00:01:16.500> it's<00:01:16.799> the

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
synchronize the true it's the

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.600 
synchronize the true it's the
synchronicity<00:01:18.420> that<00:01:19.170> causes<00:01:19.619> problems<00:01:20.490> you

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
synchronicity that causes problems you

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.370 
synchronicity that causes problems you
got<00:01:20.729> to<00:01:20.909> synchronize<00:01:21.479> when<00:01:21.869> you<00:01:21.990> work<00:01:22.200> your

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
got to synchronize when you work your

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.300 
got to synchronize when you work your
slow<00:01:22.650> twitch<00:01:23.030> fibers<00:01:24.619> with<00:01:25.619> stretching<00:01:25.979> and

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
slow twitch fibers with stretching and

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.850 
slow twitch fibers with stretching and
when<00:01:26.640> you<00:01:26.850> work<00:01:27.090> your<00:01:27.299> fast<00:01:27.990> for<00:01:28.259> its<00:01:28.290> fibers

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
when you work your fast for its fibers

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.609 
when you work your fast for its fibers
you<00:01:29.040> got<00:01:29.070> to<00:01:29.450> work<00:01:30.450> on<00:01:30.630> synchronizing<00:01:31.290> them

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
you got to work on synchronizing them

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.210 
you got to work on synchronizing them
with<00:01:31.799> stretching<00:01:32.130> if<00:01:33.000> you<00:01:33.750> do<00:01:33.990> that<00:01:34.259> then<00:01:35.009> all

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
with stretching if you do that then all

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.590 
with stretching if you do that then all
of<00:01:35.250> a<00:01:35.460> sudden<00:01:35.490> you're<00:01:35.970> going<00:01:36.090> to<00:01:36.150> get<00:01:36.299> more

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
of a sudden you're going to get more

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.100 
of a sudden you're going to get more
powerful<00:01:37.320> more<00:01:37.610> explosive<00:01:38.610> so<00:01:39.570> if<00:01:39.750> you<00:01:39.869> really

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
powerful more explosive so if you really

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.850 
powerful more explosive so if you really
want<00:01:40.500> to<00:01:40.650> improve<00:01:41.150> all<00:01:42.150> I'm<00:01:42.450> sedan<00:01:42.899> suggesting

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
want to improve all I'm sedan suggesting

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.730 
want to improve all I'm sedan suggesting
is<00:01:44.040> that<00:01:44.100> you<00:01:44.729> incorporate<00:01:45.479> a<00:01:45.720> leg<00:01:46.110> stretching

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
is that you incorporate a leg stretching

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.609 
is that you incorporate a leg stretching
