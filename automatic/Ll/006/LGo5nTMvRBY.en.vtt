than what is found in compact cameras

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.190 
than what is found in compact cameras
and<00:00:32.520> therefore<00:00:32.880> should<00:00:33.090> allow<00:00:33.390> higher<00:00:33.899> image

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
and therefore should allow higher image

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.319 
and therefore should allow higher image
quality<00:00:34.280> but<00:00:35.280> still<00:00:35.550> it<00:00:35.790> is<00:00:35.820> much<00:00:36.180> smaller

colors do appear a little dull on
default<00:00:58.140> settings<00:00:58.590> so<00:00:58.949> you<00:00:59.010> will<00:00:59.340> have<00:00:59.489> to

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
default settings so you will have to

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.400 
default settings so you will have to
play<00:00:59.820> with<00:01:00.000> saturations<00:01:00.660> a<00:01:00.750> little<00:01:01.050> bit<00:01:01.199> or

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
play with saturations a little bit or

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.950 
play with saturations a little bit or
post-process<00:01:02.160> them<00:01:02.399> on<00:01:02.550> PC<00:01:03.030> later<00:01:03.270> as<00:01:03.600> I<00:01:03.780> did

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
post-process them on PC later as I did

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.710 
post-process them on PC later as I did
but<00:01:04.710> more<00:01:05.010> or<00:01:05.220> less<00:01:05.400> the<00:01:05.760> image<00:01:06.030> quality<00:01:06.180> is

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
but more or less the image quality is

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.420 
but more or less the image quality is
quite<00:01:06.930> good<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.530> main<00:01:07.650> problem<00:01:08.130> with<00:01:08.159> this

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
quite good the main problem with this

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.000 
quite good the main problem with this
camera<00:01:08.790> is<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:09.479> smaller<00:01:09.780> sensor<00:01:10.229> it<00:01:10.680> has<00:01:10.979> a

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
camera is the smaller sensor it has a

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.719 
camera is the smaller sensor it has a
lot<00:01:11.189> of<00:01:11.220> noise<00:01:11.580> on<00:01:11.820> higher<00:01:12.090> ISO<00:01:12.689> settings<00:01:13.200> and

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:13.729 
lot of noise on higher ISO settings and

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:17.090 
lot of noise on higher ISO settings and
actually<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:14.880> main<00:01:15.540> problem<00:01:16.049> is<00:01:16.200> that<00:01:16.470> the

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
actually the main problem is that the

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.830 
actually the main problem is that the
noise<00:01:17.220> reduction<00:01:17.610> is<00:01:17.909> very<00:01:17.970> strong<00:01:18.570> and

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
noise reduction is very strong and

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.469 
noise reduction is very strong and
destroys<00:01:19.350> all<00:01:19.650> the<00:01:19.950> fine<00:01:20.310> details<00:01:20.340> in<00:01:20.939> images

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
destroys all the fine details in images

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.260 
destroys all the fine details in images
even<00:01:21.750> in<00:01:21.900> raw<00:01:22.380> file<00:01:22.890> format<00:01:23.369> currently<00:01:24.090> there

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
even in raw file format currently there

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.020 
even in raw file format currently there
are<00:01:24.299> two<00:01:24.509> lenses<00:01:24.930> for<00:01:25.320> something<00:01:26.220> NEX<00:01:26.670> mini

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
are two lenses for something NEX mini

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.289 
are two lenses for something NEX mini
camera<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:28.320> first<00:01:28.500> one<00:01:28.799> is<00:01:29.070> this<00:01:29.310> pancake<00:01:29.790> 9

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
camera the first one is this pancake 9

camera the first one is this pancake 9
millimeter<00:01:30.750> in<00:01:31.439> 35<00:01:32.070> millimeter<00:01:32.520> terms<00:01:32.880> it

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
millimeter in 35 millimeter terms it

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.260 
millimeter in 35 millimeter terms it
gives<00:01:33.479> you<00:01:33.659> 25<00:01:34.320> 24<00:01:34.950> millimeter<00:01:35.460> field<00:01:35.880> of<00:01:36.090> view

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
gives you 25 24 millimeter field of view

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.749 
gives you 25 24 millimeter field of view
equivalent<00:01:36.869> with<00:01:37.470> this<00:01:37.650> lens<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:38.189> camera<00:01:38.220> is

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
equivalent with this lens the camera is

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.539 
equivalent with this lens the camera is
really<00:01:39.360> small<00:01:39.659> and<00:01:39.900> thin<00:01:40.140> and<00:01:40.409> it<00:01:41.009> can<00:01:41.189> fit<00:01:41.369> in

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
really small and thin and it can fit in

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.120 
really small and thin and it can fit in
any<00:01:41.700> pocket<00:01:41.939> the<00:01:42.869> problem<00:01:43.200> with<00:01:43.350> this<00:01:43.470> lens<00:01:43.740> is

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
any pocket the problem with this lens is

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.770 
any pocket the problem with this lens is
it<00:01:44.399> doesn't<00:01:45.000> have<00:01:45.180> built-in<00:01:45.570> image

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
it doesn't have built-in image

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.630 
it doesn't have built-in image
stabilization<00:01:46.220> therefore<00:01:47.220> it<00:01:47.310> is<00:01:47.430> not<00:01:47.579> very

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
stabilization therefore it is not very

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.690 
stabilization therefore it is not very
good<00:01:48.000> for<00:01:48.210> video<00:01:48.390> and<00:01:49.049> roll<00:01:49.350> light<00:01:49.590> and<00:01:50.009> also

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
good for video and roll light and also

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.899 
good for video and roll light and also
it<00:01:50.850> has<00:01:51.060> very<00:01:51.390> slow<00:01:51.659> aperture<00:01:52.200> of<00:01:52.430> f3<00:01:53.430> point<00:01:53.670> 5

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
it has very slow aperture of f3 point 5

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.600 
it has very slow aperture of f3 point 5
this<00:01:54.509> is<00:01:54.570> not<00:01:54.869> good<00:01:55.079> for<00:01:55.110> low-light<00:01:55.710> the

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
this is not good for low-light the

that you use the wrist strap at all

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.270 
that you use the wrist strap at all
times<00:02:54.419> so<00:02:54.720> you<00:02:54.780> do<00:02:54.989> not<00:02:55.109> draw<00:02:55.409> the<00:02:55.470> camera<00:02:55.889> on

buy cameras with higher image quality

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:59.670 
buy cameras with higher image quality
there<00:04:58.539> is<00:04:58.659> no<00:04:58.779> clear<00:04:59.020> reason<00:04:59.229> not<00:04:59.620> to

there is no clear reason not to

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:01.980 
there is no clear reason not to
recommend<00:05:00.039> but<00:05:00.370> the<00:05:00.490> NX<00:05:00.759> mini<00:05:01.000> but<00:05:01.629> I<00:05:01.659> think

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:01.990 
recommend but the NX mini but I think

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:04.200 
recommend but the NX mini but I think
there<00:05:02.259> are<00:05:02.289> better<00:05:02.379> options<00:05:02.710> out<00:05:03.279> there<00:05:03.550> these

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:04.210 
there are better options out there these

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:05.700 
there are better options out there these
are<00:05:04.360> all<00:05:04.449> the<00:05:04.569> basics<00:05:04.930> about<00:05:05.080> the<00:05:05.349> NX<00:05:05.650> mini
