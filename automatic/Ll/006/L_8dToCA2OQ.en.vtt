00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:17.039
 part 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:53.149
 for me it's really accurate that I 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:01:00.680
 had a little trouble and ends up here you go 

00:00:53.149 --> 00:01:00.680
 you fall you go to your internet 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:09.409
 then I have imposed settings the 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:39.689
 men and then you always go on his 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:45.710

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:55.710

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.280
 go m 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:19.430

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:23.850

00:02:42.030 --> 00:03:00.290

00:02:47.550 --> 00:03:00.290
 web login test and put it all 

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:09.150
 and you go back you turn off your 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:13.890
 only one sees there once these 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:18.690
 backups and hop you go on your 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:24.769
 game does not commit when and how do I you 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:29.359
 put the misrata fangs that I'm going 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:33.799
 get a phase a site I come from 

00:03:29.359 --> 00:03:36.959
 show on the first part 

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:40.380
 it moves at home it's normal no I 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:46.859
 filmed with a little mistake like no 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:49.769
 the video here it was me I'm going 

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:52.650
 receive from wever overlap is done 

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:54.090
 of a you to see her black and white 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:55.340
 voters it works on all 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:04:00.340
 versions 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:04:05.610
 so my cousin is there and 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:22.180
 and I'll make you a little place 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:27.360
 my team has the future scratch and the cpc 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:32.560
 from chiba cola but on the malignant stand 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:40.630
 put me I put move and there I go 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:47.380
 take off will it tell me game piss not the 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:51.280
 case but I did it here I was 

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:54.669
 untenable in my team that is level 

00:04:51.280 --> 00:05:00.550
 1 and he changed shape thanks to his 

00:04:54.669 --> 00:05:06.100
 leader of his tree this is their bus that 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:09.130
 molts and condemns go you put it are 

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:18.479
 dead or alive so I removed well 

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:18.479
 in Iraq then my name I went back 

00:05:26.849 --> 00:05:36.970
 all alone and in your gps and I have 

00:05:33.669 --> 00:05:41.490
 no two axioms the replays you 

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:45.250
 will show at the end of the video why 

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:46.320
 I do not really want to pay for 

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:48.180
 it 

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:54.060
 it's useless as long as you have 

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:55.950
 these sites you all have spoken by 

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:58.650
 all the objects here you do not have 

00:05:55.950 --> 00:06:06.020
 pokemon I animate and you go 

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:08.340
 I had not been exchanged yet 

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:11.310
 you tell yourself to back up the part 

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:13.880
 you put yes that's all normal 

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:13.880
 for eurostar 

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:19.920
 and that's where everything goes it's you and if 

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:23.040
 it does not work enough that I have a small 

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:29.960
 problem when it should work then 

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:33.090
 I promised you giratina end of 

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:37.020
 level 1 they will be able to put you at 

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:37.980
 level and you get grappilled rating to 

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:40.320
 quickly forget 

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:47.130
 that's why he's changing his promotion from 

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:49.020
 kind orthez had serious not see 

00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:51.840
 frankly the difference is always 

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:56.730
 marked by the marks and arched back 

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:58.970
 here it is I remind you that it is not 

00:06:56.730 --> 00:07:03.150
 that it's eric bertinat again 

00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:05.360
 you fall from magic an agps and that has 

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:05.360
 market 

00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:11.490
 will you put a gain of 

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:18.380
 text verification and viruses 

00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:18.380
 and here is my stop proof 

00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:23.270
 here we are 

00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:37.560
 that's it, so I'm telling you very soon 

00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:39.830
 for a new video again rather 

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:39.830
 chip
