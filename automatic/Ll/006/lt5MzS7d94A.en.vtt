to the bump in there the slot so I'll

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.950 
to the bump in there the slot so I'll
just<00:01:34.979> line<00:01:35.250> that<00:01:35.280> up<00:01:35.490> get<00:01:36.270> your<00:01:36.420> speed<00:01:36.479> right

just line that up get your speed right
here<00:01:37.429> just<00:01:38.429> push<00:01:38.670> it<00:01:38.850> in

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:53.160 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:59.370 

and<00:01:54.160> then<00:01:54.720> again<00:01:56.130> hey<00:01:57.130> go<00:01:57.340> inside

00:01:59.370 --> 00:01:59.380 
and then again hey go inside

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:06.139 
and then again hey go inside
that<00:01:59.979> same<00:02:00.250> kid<00:02:00.549> it<00:02:00.670> and<00:02:00.939> turn<00:02:01.210> it<00:02:01.329> clockwise

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:11.339 

so<00:02:07.149> then<00:02:07.299> this<00:02:07.450> line<00:02:07.750> will<00:02:08.020> be<00:02:08.050> horizontal<00:02:10.349> hey

00:02:11.339 --> 00:02:11.349 
so then this line will be horizontal hey

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:14.190 
so then this line will be horizontal hey
after<00:02:11.709> you<00:02:11.950> do<00:02:12.099> that<00:02:12.480> we<00:02:13.480> put<00:02:13.750> the<00:02:13.870> clips<00:02:14.110> back

looking through here you'll see a white

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:30.330 
looking through here you'll see a white
light<00:02:27.640> here<00:02:27.849> if<00:02:27.970> it<00:02:28.120> works
