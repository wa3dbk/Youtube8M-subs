 [music] 

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:10.589
 Hello, my name is 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.199
 today we will be learning push-ups on 

00:00:10.589 --> 00:00:15.500
 grucy to learn 

00:00:13.199 --> 00:00:20.660
 push up on the bars you first need 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:20.660
 be good at pushing up a grasshopper 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:25.570
 now will show us 

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:33.910
 if you fail so how can we 

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:37.530
 you can first start push-ups 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:37.530
 grasshopper with hookah 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.660
 So 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.410
 but 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:52.739
 so pushups are much easier and eastern 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.750
 it will turn out to increase sufficient 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.060
 number of pushups 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.290
 grasshopper with your knees you will begin 

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:02.790
 get pushups 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:06.440
 grasshopper son then we increase 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:09.830
 the number of push ups grasshopper slug to 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:13.369
 about 20 times and you can proceed 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:13.369
 push-ups throwing 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.079
 after you have learned well 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.760
 push up grasshopper or narrow 

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:23.120
 setting a lesson 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:25.210
 By the way, you need to pay attention to the fact that 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:29.600
 when you bet 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:30.570
 hands narrow setting so that when 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.730
 push ups 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.630
 However , in fact, not a year, but along 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:38.410
 this is very important mom 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:40.820
 so here you are 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:43.820
 enough macro wringing out grasshopper 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:46.060
 then try squeezer dope i'll save 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:47.740
 you who can not 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:50.610
 first tr 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:50.610
 with partner 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.340
 [applause] 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.220
 in this way we help 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:12.930
 our companion push-ups on the bars 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:15.630
 moreover, expect the force so that it 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:19.180
 it was not too difficult but not 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:20.740
 about need to do about 7 times in 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:24.660
 one approach 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:27.270
 still very important point last approach 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:30.300
 need to try 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:31.860
 okay so that he did the last 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:35.360
 repetition of struggles 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:39.400
 it is difficult last repetition with 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:42.489
 on developing your muscles don't forget 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:45.299
 over time, the muscles will get stronger get used to and 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:50.530
 he can do it himself 

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:52.390
 as for the other points regarding 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:54.250
 tiffany or power 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:56.240
 look 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:58.070
 my previous 

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:02.260
 learn to pull up on our 

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:02.260
 good luck to the training page 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:09.360
 if vulcan 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.360
