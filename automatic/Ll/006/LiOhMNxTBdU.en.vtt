00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
look at a few other simple variations

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.379 
look at a few other simple variations
that<00:00:10.170> are<00:00:10.230> easy<00:00:10.440> too<00:00:10.679> so<00:00:10.920> if<00:00:11.759> you<00:00:11.940> look<00:00:12.120> at<00:00:12.269> this

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
that are easy too so if you look at this

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.680 
that are easy too so if you look at this
quote<00:00:12.690> here<00:00:13.259> you<00:00:13.830> can<00:00:14.009> see<00:00:14.280> that<00:00:14.580> I<00:00:14.880> pasted<00:00:15.480> the

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
quote here you can see that I pasted the

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.359 
quote here you can see that I pasted the
center<00:00:16.049> of<00:00:16.260> the<00:00:16.410> logs<00:00:16.590> instead<00:00:17.070> of<00:00:17.250> the

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
center of the logs instead of the

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:18.710 
center of the logs instead of the
novelty<00:00:17.789> print<00:00:18.029> that<00:00:18.150> we<00:00:18.270> were<00:00:18.359> just<00:00:18.570> working

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
novelty print that we were just working

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.160 
novelty print that we were just working
with<00:00:19.050> so<00:00:19.680> here<00:00:19.920> is<00:00:20.010> a<00:00:20.039> four<00:00:20.430> and<00:00:20.490> a<00:00:20.550> half<00:00:20.609> inch

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:21.170 
with so here is a four and a half inch

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:23.420 
with so here is a four and a half inch
unfinished<00:00:22.170> flower<00:00:22.529> block<00:00:22.859> in<00:00:23.039> the<00:00:23.130> center

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
unfinished flower block in the center

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.240 
unfinished flower block in the center
and<00:00:23.720> light<00:00:24.720> logs<00:00:24.960> sewn<00:00:25.289> on<00:00:25.410> two<00:00:25.590> sides<00:00:25.859> dark

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
logs sewn on two sides so basically the

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.769 
logs sewn on two sides so basically the
same<00:00:28.859> type<00:00:29.220> of<00:00:29.250> thing<00:00:29.699> that<00:00:30.000> we've<00:00:30.539> sewn

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
same type of thing that we've sewn

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.870 
same type of thing that we've sewn
before<00:00:31.170> only<00:00:31.380> using<00:00:31.859> a<00:00:31.920> pieced<00:00:32.219> block<00:00:32.579> in<00:00:32.790> the

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
before only using a pieced block in the

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.580 
before only using a pieced block in the
center<00:00:33.180> and<00:00:33.690> I<00:00:33.780> want<00:00:33.930> you<00:00:34.020> to<00:00:34.079> look<00:00:34.230> at<00:00:34.380> these

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
center and I want you to look at these

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.700 
center and I want you to look at these
two<00:00:34.920> blocks<00:00:35.160> right<00:00:35.489> here<00:00:35.880> they're<00:00:36.630> the<00:00:37.440> same

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
two blocks right here they're the same

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.350 
two blocks right here they're the same
block<00:00:38.010> just<00:00:38.640> with<00:00:38.820> a<00:00:38.850> different<00:00:38.940> orientation

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
block just with a different orientation

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.380 
block just with a different orientation
and<00:00:40.370> the<00:00:41.370> one<00:00:41.489> thing<00:00:41.640> we<00:00:41.730> talked<00:00:41.969> about<00:00:42.090> with

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
and the one thing we talked about with

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.779 
and the one thing we talked about with
novelty<00:00:42.780> print<00:00:43.140> is<00:00:43.320> having<00:00:43.680> your<00:00:43.860> your<00:00:44.100> design

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
novelty print is having your your design

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.729 
novelty print is having your your design
always<00:00:45.149> facing<00:00:45.750> the<00:00:45.780> same<00:00:46.050> direction<00:00:46.289> by

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
always facing the same direction by

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.290 
always facing the same direction by
where<00:00:46.920> you<00:00:47.039> start<00:00:47.370> sewing<00:00:47.640> your<00:00:47.820> first<00:00:48.030> log

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
where you start sewing your first log

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.330 
where you start sewing your first log
for<00:00:48.960> something<00:00:49.289> like<00:00:49.440> this<00:00:49.620> these<00:00:49.890> logs<00:00:50.129> were

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
for something like this these logs were

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.459 
for something like this these logs were
made<00:00:50.489> exactly<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:51.030> same<00:00:51.199> so<00:00:52.199> the<00:00:52.320> orientation

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
made exactly the same so the orientation

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.610 
made exactly the same so the orientation
of<00:00:53.010> the<00:00:53.129> first<00:00:53.370> log<00:00:53.610> is<00:00:54.090> on<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:55.050> left<00:00:55.260> side<00:00:55.500> of

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
of the first log is on the left side of

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.830 
of the first log is on the left side of
the<00:00:55.680> flower<00:00:55.890> in<00:00:56.280> both<00:00:56.910> of<00:00:57.059> these<00:00:57.149> cases<00:00:57.420> but

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
the flower in both of these cases but

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.020 
the flower in both of these cases but
here<00:00:58.440> you<00:00:58.530> can<00:00:58.649> see<00:00:58.800> that<00:00:58.949> the<00:00:59.070> flower<00:00:59.609> is<00:00:59.760> in<00:00:59.969> a

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
here you can see that the flower is in a

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.880 
here you can see that the flower is in a
different<00:01:00.329> orientation<00:01:00.510> and<00:01:01.199> for<00:01:01.710> some

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
different orientation and for some

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.070 
different orientation and for some
design<00:01:02.460> like<00:01:02.640> this<00:01:02.820> that<00:01:03.480> works<00:01:03.660> perfectly

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
design like this that works perfectly

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.840 
design like this that works perfectly
fine<00:01:04.350> so<00:01:04.680> you<00:01:04.710> don't<00:01:04.920> always<00:01:05.100> have<00:01:05.519> to<00:01:05.729> be

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
fine so you don't always have to be

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.359 
fine so you don't always have to be
changing<00:01:06.360> your<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:07.530> position<00:01:07.950> of<00:01:08.040> your<00:01:08.159> first

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
changing your the position of your first

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.130 
changing your the position of your first
log<00:01:08.640> to<00:01:08.850> keep<00:01:09.060> the<00:01:09.210> orientation<00:01:09.750> the<00:01:09.840> same<00:01:09.869> if

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
log to keep the orientation the same if

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.690 
log to keep the orientation the same if
you'd<00:01:10.260> like<00:01:10.380> a<00:01:10.439> design<00:01:10.799> that<00:01:10.979> flows<00:01:11.189> like<00:01:11.310> this

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
you'd like a design that flows like this

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.550 
you'd like a design that flows like this
another<00:01:12.630> thing<00:01:12.900> that's<00:01:13.110> a<00:01:13.290> little<00:01:13.320> bit

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
another thing that's a little bit

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.050 
another thing that's a little bit
different<00:01:13.979> about<00:01:14.040> this<00:01:14.369> one<00:01:14.580> is<00:01:14.700> that<00:01:14.850> there's

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
different about this one is that there's

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.270 
different about this one is that there's
only<00:01:15.180> two<00:01:15.570> rows<00:01:15.780> of<00:01:15.810> lights<00:01:16.290> and<00:01:16.560> two<00:01:16.890> rows<00:01:17.100> of

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
only two rows of lights and two rows of

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.310 
only two rows of lights and two rows of
darks<00:01:17.610> so<00:01:18.119> there's<00:01:18.330> no<00:01:18.509> real<00:01:18.750> hard<00:01:19.049> and<00:01:19.170> cut

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
darks so there's no real hard and cut

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.530 
darks so there's no real hard and cut
fast<00:01:19.680> rules<00:01:20.100> that<00:01:20.400> you<00:01:20.520> have<00:01:20.729> to<00:01:21.000> follow<00:01:21.240> when

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
fast rules that you have to follow when

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.090 
fast rules that you have to follow when
you're<00:01:21.689> making<00:01:21.869> a<00:01:22.049> log<00:01:22.200> cabin<00:01:22.590> you<00:01:22.710> can<00:01:22.890> just

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
you're making a log cabin you can just

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.640 
you're making a log cabin you can just
make<00:01:23.310> them<00:01:23.460> whatever<00:01:24.360> size<00:01:24.600> finish<00:01:25.200> block<00:01:25.409> you

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
make them whatever size finish block you

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.440 
make them whatever size finish block you
want<00:01:25.770> by<00:01:26.040> having<00:01:26.400> you<00:01:26.880> know<00:01:26.939> whatever<00:01:27.090> numbers

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
want by having you know whatever numbers

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.630 
want by having you know whatever numbers
tricks<00:01:27.780> you'd<00:01:27.900> like<00:01:28.049> to<00:01:28.170> have<00:01:28.320> on<00:01:28.500> there<00:01:28.710> so

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
tricks you'd like to have on there so

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:36.109 
tricks you'd like to have on there so
let's<00:01:29.790> look<00:01:29.909> at<00:01:30.030> another<00:01:30.240> one<00:01:34.700> okay<00:01:35.700> for<00:01:35.970> this

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
let's look at another one okay for this

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:40.460 
let's look at another one okay for this
quilt<00:01:37.939> you'll<00:01:38.939> notice<00:01:39.390> that<00:01:39.780> there<00:01:40.229> is<00:01:40.259> a

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
quilt you'll notice that there is a

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.819 
quilt you'll notice that there is a
piece<00:01:41.280> star<00:01:41.759> in<00:01:42.150> the<00:01:42.780> center<00:01:43.140> of<00:01:43.170> this<00:01:43.619> log

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
piece star in the center of this log

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.249 
piece star in the center of this log
cabin<00:01:43.860> block<00:01:44.430> here<00:01:44.790> and<00:01:44.970> a<00:01:45.750> little<00:01:46.049> bit

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
cabin block here and a little bit

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:47.840 
cabin block here and a little bit
different<00:01:46.590> than<00:01:46.740> we've<00:01:46.920> talked<00:01:47.159> about<00:01:47.310> before

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
different than we've talked about before

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.240 
different than we've talked about before
this<00:01:48.600> one<00:01:48.869> doesn't<00:01:49.079> have<00:01:49.229> definite<00:01:50.070> light

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
this one doesn't have definite light

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:51.920 
this one doesn't have definite light
side<00:01:50.520> in<00:01:50.670> a<00:01:50.700> definite<00:01:51.060> dark<00:01:51.270> side<00:01:51.479> it's<00:01:51.720> got<00:01:51.899> a

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
side in a definite dark side it's got a

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.410 
side in a definite dark side it's got a
red<00:01:52.200> side<00:01:52.439> and<00:01:52.470> a<00:01:52.740> blue<00:01:52.829> side<00:01:53.159> so<00:01:54.000> a<00:01:54.030> little<00:01:54.299> bit

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
red side and a blue side so a little bit

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:55.370 
red side and a blue side so a little bit
different<00:01:54.780> from<00:01:54.899> before

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
different from before

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.160 
different from before
and<00:01:55.969> in<00:01:56.969> this<00:01:57.180> block<00:01:57.479> right<00:01:57.659> next<00:01:57.899> to<00:01:58.140> it

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
and in this block right next to it

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.469 
and in this block right next to it
here's<00:01:58.979> my<00:01:59.159> log<00:01:59.369> cabin<00:01:59.820> but<00:01:59.969> this<00:02:00.119> time<00:02:00.299> it's

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
here's my log cabin but this time it's

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:01.940 
here's my log cabin but this time it's
in<00:02:00.600> the<00:02:00.689> center<00:02:01.049> of<00:02:01.079> the<00:02:01.259> piece<00:02:01.439> block<00:02:01.740> as

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
in the center of the piece block as

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.609 
in the center of the piece block as
opposed<00:02:02.280> to<00:02:02.430> the<00:02:02.759> piece<00:02:02.969> Block<00:02:03.240> in<00:02:03.450> the<00:02:03.570> center

00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:03.619 
opposed to the piece Block in the center

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:05.929 
opposed to the piece Block in the center
where<00:02:04.619> again<00:02:04.860> I<00:02:04.890> have<00:02:05.159> a<00:02:05.189> light<00:02:05.460> side<00:02:05.670> and<00:02:05.700> a

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
where again I have a light side and a

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:08.479 
where again I have a light side and a
dark<00:02:05.969> side<00:02:06.439> so<00:02:07.439> that<00:02:07.590> more<00:02:07.890> the<00:02:08.009> traditional

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
dark side so that more the traditional

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:11.059 
dark side so that more the traditional
log<00:02:08.640> cabin<00:02:09.030> block<00:02:09.119> so<00:02:09.869> here<00:02:10.259> this<00:02:10.590> quilt<00:02:10.890> is

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
log cabin block so here this quilt is

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.740 
log cabin block so here this quilt is
these<00:02:11.640> two<00:02:11.879> different<00:02:12.180> variations<00:02:12.720> here

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
these two different variations here

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.270 
these two different variations here
and<00:02:13.900> you<00:02:14.020> can<00:02:14.170> tell<00:02:14.350> them<00:02:14.470> and<00:02:14.560> I<00:02:14.680> noticed<00:02:15.010> a

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
and you can tell them and I noticed a

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.070 
and you can tell them and I noticed a
hand<00:02:15.880> quilted<00:02:16.360> this<00:02:16.450> one<00:02:16.660> so<00:02:16.750> you<00:02:16.810> can<00:02:16.930> tell

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
hand quilted this one so you can tell

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.320 
hand quilted this one so you can tell
it's<00:02:17.260> a<00:02:17.290> long<00:02:17.530> time<00:02:17.830> ago<00:02:18.040> because<00:02:18.400> don't<00:02:19.210> have

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
it's a long time ago because don't have

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:22.980 
it's a long time ago because don't have
time<00:02:19.540> for<00:02:19.570> hand<00:02:19.900> quilting<00:02:20.290> anymore<00:02:21.990> okay

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:22.990 
time for hand quilting anymore okay

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:28.620 
time for hand quilting anymore okay
let's<00:02:23.200> look<00:02:23.290> at<00:02:23.380> another<00:02:23.470> one<00:02:27.300> kind<00:02:28.300> of<00:02:28.330> along

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:28.630 
let's look at another one kind of along

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:31.410 
let's look at another one kind of along
the<00:02:28.660> same<00:02:29.170> lines<00:02:29.470> as<00:02:29.680> the<00:02:29.890> last<00:02:30.130> one<00:02:30.520> this<00:02:31.180> one

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
the same lines as the last one this one

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.510 
the same lines as the last one this one
has<00:02:31.630> a<00:02:31.990> different<00:02:32.440> star<00:02:32.740> that's<00:02:33.010> pieced<00:02:33.340> in

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:33.520 
has a different star that's pieced in

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:35.070 
has a different star that's pieced in
the<00:02:33.640> centre<00:02:33.940> of<00:02:33.970> the<00:02:34.090> log<00:02:34.270> cabin<00:02:34.300> and<00:02:34.810> again

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
the centre of the log cabin and again

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.200 
the centre of the log cabin and again
traditional<00:02:36.010> in<00:02:36.160> that<00:02:36.310> it's<00:02:36.550> light<00:02:36.850> on<00:02:36.880> one

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:37.210 
traditional in that it's light on one

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:39.330 
traditional in that it's light on one
side<00:02:37.450> and<00:02:37.630> dark<00:02:37.870> on<00:02:38.020> the<00:02:38.140> other<00:02:38.290> side<00:02:38.620> but<00:02:39.280> the

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
side and dark on the other side but the

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:41.450 
side and dark on the other side but the
difference<00:02:39.820> being<00:02:40.060> here<00:02:40.540> is<00:02:40.660> that<00:02:40.690> there's

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:41.460 
difference being here is that there's

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:44.430 
difference being here is that there's
squares<00:02:42.460> in<00:02:42.880> the<00:02:42.970> corners<00:02:43.390> of<00:02:43.570> the<00:02:43.660> log<00:02:43.870> cabins

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.440 
squares in the corners of the log cabins

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.280 
squares in the corners of the log cabins
right<00:02:45.430> here<00:02:45.790> so<00:02:46.300> this<00:02:46.480> is<00:02:46.600> more<00:02:46.810> of<00:02:46.840> a<00:02:46.959> chimney

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
right here so this is more of a chimney

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:48.990 
right here so this is more of a chimney
and<00:02:47.500> cornerstone<00:02:48.010> variation<00:02:48.640> of<00:02:48.730> a<00:02:48.790> log<00:02:48.970> cabin

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
and cornerstone variation of a log cabin

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.990 
and cornerstone variation of a log cabin
block<00:02:49.600> so<00:02:50.320> that<00:02:50.350> the<00:02:50.740> squares<00:02:51.130> continue<00:02:51.760> in

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
block so that the squares continue in

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.240 
block so that the squares continue in
the<00:02:52.120> star<00:02:52.390> blocks<00:02:52.660> themselves<00:02:53.320> and<00:02:53.500> just<00:02:53.560> work

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
the star blocks themselves and just work

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:57.120 
the star blocks themselves and just work
out<00:02:54.459> to<00:02:54.670> the<00:02:54.700> ends<00:02:55.060> of<00:02:55.180> the<00:02:55.360> the<00:02:55.959> logs<00:02:56.170> but

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:57.130 
out to the ends of the the logs but

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:58.710 
out to the ends of the the logs but
again<00:02:57.340> light<00:02:57.730> on<00:02:57.820> one<00:02:58.000> side<00:02:58.209> dark<00:02:58.450> on<00:02:58.600> the

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
again light on one side dark on the

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.949 
again light on one side dark on the
other<00:02:58.870> just<00:02:59.590> a<00:03:00.150> variation<00:03:01.150> where<00:03:01.600> the<00:03:01.720> blacks

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:01.959 
other just a variation where the blacks

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:04.530 
other just a variation where the blacks
rotate<00:03:02.380> across<00:03:02.590> the<00:03:02.920> quilt<00:03:03.160> and<00:03:03.790> if<00:03:04.300> you<00:03:04.390> can

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 
rotate across the quilt and if you can

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:06.090 
rotate across the quilt and if you can
see<00:03:04.720> the<00:03:04.840> center<00:03:05.170> block<00:03:05.380> here<00:03:05.740> this<00:03:05.920> is

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:06.100 
see the center block here this is

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:08.820 
see the center block here this is
actually<00:03:06.280> a<00:03:06.520> little<00:03:06.940> log<00:03:07.540> cabin<00:03:07.990> block<00:03:08.140> where

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:08.830 
actually a little log cabin block where

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:10.800 
actually a little log cabin block where
I've<00:03:08.980> got<00:03:09.160> a<00:03:09.190> square<00:03:09.490> in<00:03:09.700> the<00:03:09.730> center<00:03:10.150> but<00:03:10.600> each

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 
I've got a square in the center but each

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:13.530 
I've got a square in the center but each
of<00:03:10.990> the<00:03:11.080> logs<00:03:11.290> again<00:03:11.740> has<00:03:12.070> a<00:03:12.100> corner<00:03:12.790> stone

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:13.540 
of the logs again has a corner stone

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:15.810 
of the logs again has a corner stone
sewn<00:03:13.930> in<00:03:14.170> just<00:03:14.770> like<00:03:14.980> these<00:03:15.160> logs<00:03:15.459> only<00:03:15.700> on<00:03:15.790> a

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:15.820 
sewn in just like these logs only on a

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:17.759 
sewn in just like these logs only on a
smaller<00:03:16.180> scale<00:03:16.510> it's<00:03:16.690> a<00:03:16.900> smaller<00:03:17.320> scale<00:03:17.560> with

00:03:17.759 --> 00:03:17.769 
smaller scale it's a smaller scale with

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:23.160 
smaller scale it's a smaller scale with
no<00:03:17.800> piece<00:03:18.280> star<00:03:18.550> in<00:03:18.640> the<00:03:18.730> center<00:03:22.170> another

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:23.170 
no piece star in the center another

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:26.400 
no piece star in the center another
variation<00:03:23.560> that's<00:03:24.070> really<00:03:24.489> easy<00:03:24.700> to<00:03:25.060> do<00:03:25.410> now

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:26.410 
variation that's really easy to do now

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:27.900 
variation that's really easy to do now
all<00:03:26.620> the<00:03:26.739> ones<00:03:26.860> we've<00:03:27.070> talked<00:03:27.370> about<00:03:27.640> so<00:03:27.880> far

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:27.910 
all the ones we've talked about so far

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:30.810 
all the ones we've talked about so far
have<00:03:28.450> had<00:03:28.480> the<00:03:28.840> same<00:03:29.140> size<00:03:29.530> strips<00:03:30.130> on<00:03:30.400> the

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:30.820 
have had the same size strips on the

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:32.490 
have had the same size strips on the
light<00:03:31.000> side<00:03:31.239> and<00:03:31.269> the<00:03:31.510> same<00:03:31.750> size<00:03:31.989> on<00:03:32.200> the<00:03:32.290> dark

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500 
light side and the same size on the dark

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:35.370 
light side and the same size on the dark
side<00:03:32.709> if<00:03:33.640> you<00:03:33.850> look<00:03:34.090> at<00:03:34.209> this<00:03:34.360> variation<00:03:34.989> here

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:35.380 
side if you look at this variation here

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:38.310 
side if you look at this variation here
on<00:03:35.530> one<00:03:36.430> side<00:03:36.730> these<00:03:37.300> strips<00:03:37.660> I'll<00:03:37.840> finish<00:03:38.050> it

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:38.320 
on one side these strips I'll finish it

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:40.470 
on one side these strips I'll finish it
a<00:03:38.410> half<00:03:38.620> inch<00:03:38.890> and<00:03:39.160> on<00:03:39.790> the<00:03:39.940> other<00:03:40.030> side<00:03:40.150> they

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:40.480 
a half inch and on the other side they

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:43.199 
a half inch and on the other side they
all<00:03:40.600> finish<00:03:40.930> at<00:03:41.200> one<00:03:41.560> inch<00:03:41.739> so<00:03:42.370> the<00:03:42.640> effect<00:03:43.000> of

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:43.209 
all finish at one inch so the effect of

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:45.570 
all finish at one inch so the effect of
sewing<00:03:43.870> these<00:03:43.989> blocks<00:03:44.320> together<00:03:44.769> is<00:03:45.280> you'll

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:45.580 
sewing these blocks together is you'll

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:47.550 
sewing these blocks together is you'll
end<00:03:45.610> up<00:03:45.880> with<00:03:46.239> lines<00:03:46.540> that<00:03:46.690> look<00:03:46.959> more<00:03:47.140> curved

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:47.560 
end up with lines that look more curved

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.100 
end up with lines that look more curved
than<00:03:47.920> straight<00:03:48.750> that's<00:03:49.750> what<00:03:49.900> you'll<00:03:50.049> see

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:50.110 
than straight that's what you'll see

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:53.280 
than straight that's what you'll see
here<00:03:50.940> so<00:03:51.940> that's<00:03:52.090> kind<00:03:52.299> of<00:03:52.360> fun<00:03:52.420> and<00:03:52.810> simple<00:03:53.019> to

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:53.290 
here so that's kind of fun and simple to

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:55.320 
here so that's kind of fun and simple to
do<00:03:53.500> and<00:03:53.709> you'll<00:03:54.250> notice<00:03:54.459> also<00:03:54.760> that<00:03:54.940> there's<00:03:55.269> a

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:55.330 
do and you'll notice also that there's a

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:58.710 
do and you'll notice also that there's a
lot<00:03:55.510> more<00:03:55.540> rows<00:03:56.110> of<00:03:56.380> logs<00:03:57.120> there's<00:03:58.120> five<00:03:58.420> rows

00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:58.720 
lot more rows of logs there's five rows

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:00.570 
lot more rows of logs there's five rows
on<00:03:59.140> each<00:03:59.200> side<00:03:59.620> as<00:03:59.769> opposed<00:04:00.100> to<00:04:00.280> the<00:04:00.400> three

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:00.580 
on each side as opposed to the three

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:07.110 
on each side as opposed to the three
that<00:04:00.670> we<00:04:00.880> were<00:04:00.940> working<00:04:01.239> with<00:04:01.360> before<00:04:06.120> now

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:07.120 
that we were working with before now

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:08.580 
that we were working with before now
these<00:04:07.269> are<00:04:07.480> just<00:04:07.630> a<00:04:07.750> few<00:04:07.780> blocks<00:04:08.110> that<00:04:08.440> I've

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:08.590 
these are just a few blocks that I've

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:11.759 
these are just a few blocks that I've
sewn<00:04:08.920> where<00:04:09.670> I've<00:04:09.880> taken<00:04:10.330> one<00:04:11.049> element<00:04:11.530> out<00:04:11.650> of

00:04:11.759 --> 00:04:11.769 
sewn where I've taken one element out of

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:13.860 
sewn where I've taken one element out of
a<00:04:11.830> traditional<00:04:12.430> block<00:04:12.670> and<00:04:12.940> replaced<00:04:13.600> it<00:04:13.840> with

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:13.870 
a traditional block and replaced it with

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:14.850 
a traditional block and replaced it with
a<00:04:14.110> log-cabin

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:14.860 
a log-cabin

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:16.380 
a log-cabin
so<00:04:15.459> if<00:04:15.549> you<00:04:15.610> kind<00:04:15.760> of<00:04:15.850> look<00:04:16.000> at<00:04:16.060> the<00:04:16.180> log<00:04:16.359> cabin

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:16.390 
so if you kind of look at the log cabin

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:18.870 
so if you kind of look at the log cabin
you<00:04:16.870> can<00:04:17.019> see<00:04:17.260> like<00:04:17.739> a<00:04:17.769> triangle<00:04:18.519> that's

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:18.880 
you can see like a triangle that's

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:21.810 
you can see like a triangle that's
formed<00:04:19.390> in<00:04:19.570> the<00:04:19.690> center<00:04:20.019> so<00:04:20.859> this<00:04:21.100> this<00:04:21.519> star

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:21.820 
formed in the center so this this star

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:23.730 
formed in the center so this this star
design<00:04:22.150> could<00:04:22.390> have<00:04:22.479> had<00:04:22.599> a<00:04:22.630> triangle<00:04:23.229> patch

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:23.740 
design could have had a triangle patch

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:25.800 
design could have had a triangle patch
in<00:04:24.010> here<00:04:24.280> and<00:04:24.460> I've<00:04:24.910> replaced<00:04:25.270> it<00:04:25.450> with<00:04:25.510> a<00:04:25.630> log

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:25.810 
in here and I've replaced it with a log

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:28.429 
in here and I've replaced it with a log
cabin

00:04:28.429 --> 00:04:28.439 

00:04:28.439 --> 00:04:30.689 

the<00:04:29.439> same<00:04:29.680> type<00:04:29.919> of<00:04:30.069> thing<00:04:30.250> in<00:04:30.340> the<00:04:30.430> center<00:04:30.669> of

00:04:30.689 --> 00:04:30.699 
the same type of thing in the center of

00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:33.119 
the same type of thing in the center of
this<00:04:30.939> block<00:04:31.270> but<00:04:32.050> this<00:04:32.259> variation<00:04:32.860> where<00:04:33.039> you

00:04:33.119 --> 00:04:33.129 
this block but this variation where you

00:04:33.129 --> 00:04:35.189 
this block but this variation where you
have<00:04:33.340> a<00:04:33.370> center<00:04:33.729> square<00:04:34.060> and<00:04:34.330> then<00:04:34.810> your<00:04:34.960> logs

00:04:35.189 --> 00:04:35.199 
have a center square and then your logs

00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:38.730 
have a center square and then your logs
are<00:04:35.530> on<00:04:35.770> opposite<00:04:36.340> sides<00:04:36.810> is<00:04:37.810> the<00:04:38.379> courthouse

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:38.740 
are on opposite sides is the courthouse

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:40.679 
are on opposite sides is the courthouse
steps<00:04:38.919> variation<00:04:39.610> of<00:04:39.699> a<00:04:39.759> log<00:04:39.909> cabin<00:04:39.939> so<00:04:40.659> a

00:04:40.679 --> 00:04:40.689 
steps variation of a log cabin so a

00:04:40.689 --> 00:04:42.480 
steps variation of a log cabin so a
little<00:04:40.990> bit<00:04:41.080> different<00:04:41.530> it<00:04:41.979> almost<00:04:42.219> looks

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:42.490 
little bit different it almost looks

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:44.490 
little bit different it almost looks
like<00:04:42.580> a<00:04:42.699> quarter<00:04:43.150> square<00:04:43.270> triangle<00:04:43.960> if<00:04:44.319> you

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:44.500 
like a quarter square triangle if you

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:46.110 
like a quarter square triangle if you
drew<00:04:44.650> diagonal<00:04:45.069> lines<00:04:45.250> to<00:04:45.460> the<00:04:45.580> center<00:04:45.849> of<00:04:45.969> it

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:46.120 
drew diagonal lines to the center of it

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:48.679 
drew diagonal lines to the center of it
so<00:04:46.870> it<00:04:46.960> a<00:04:47.050> little<00:04:47.259> different<00:04:47.590> effect<00:04:47.860> there

00:04:48.679 --> 00:04:48.689 
so it a little different effect there

00:04:48.689 --> 00:04:53.999 
so it a little different effect there
and<00:04:49.689> the<00:04:49.990> third<00:04:50.229> one<00:04:52.080> different<00:04:53.080> colorings<00:04:53.590> of

00:04:53.999 --> 00:04:54.009 
and the third one different colorings of

00:04:54.009 --> 00:04:56.459 
and the third one different colorings of
the<00:04:54.759> traditional<00:04:55.240> log<00:04:55.389> cabin<00:04:55.840> but<00:04:55.990> I<00:04:56.050> put<00:04:56.319> the

00:04:56.459 --> 00:04:56.469 
the traditional log cabin but I put the

00:04:56.469 --> 00:04:58.920 
the traditional log cabin but I put the
colors<00:04:56.860> in<00:04:57.250> the<00:04:57.669> log<00:04:57.849> cabin<00:04:58.090> on<00:04:58.389> the<00:04:58.599> opposite

00:04:58.920 --> 00:04:58.930 
colors in the log cabin on the opposite

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:01.350 
colors in the log cabin on the opposite
sides<00:04:59.139> of<00:04:59.349> the<00:04:59.409> star<00:04:59.680> points<00:05:00.060> so<00:05:01.060> a<00:05:01.090> little<00:05:01.210> bit

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:01.360 
sides of the star points so a little bit

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:03.600 
sides of the star points so a little bit
different<00:05:01.689> you<00:05:01.719> can<00:05:01.960> replace<00:05:02.710> parts<00:05:03.189> of<00:05:03.400> your

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:03.610 
different you can replace parts of your

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:05.459 
different you can replace parts of your
traditional<00:05:04.210> blocks<00:05:04.449> with<00:05:04.689> log<00:05:04.900> cabins<00:05:05.319> like

00:05:05.459 --> 00:05:05.469 
traditional blocks with log cabins like

00:05:05.469 --> 00:05:08.519 
traditional blocks with log cabins like
these<00:05:05.710> and<00:05:05.979> you'll<00:05:06.729> have<00:05:06.969> to<00:05:07.180> figure<00:05:07.990> the<00:05:08.229> size

00:05:08.519 --> 00:05:08.529 
these and you'll have to figure the size

00:05:08.529 --> 00:05:10.679 
these and you'll have to figure the size
of<00:05:08.889> your<00:05:09.069> logs<00:05:09.310> based<00:05:09.759> on<00:05:09.969> the<00:05:10.090> size<00:05:10.300> that<00:05:10.539> you

00:05:10.679 --> 00:05:10.689 
of your logs based on the size that you

00:05:10.689 --> 00:05:15.659 
of your logs based on the size that you
want<00:05:10.719> your<00:05:11.020> finished<00:05:11.139> patch<00:05:11.500> to<00:05:11.770> be<00:05:14.669> here's

00:05:15.659 --> 00:05:15.669 
want your finished patch to be here's

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:17.850 
want your finished patch to be here's
some<00:05:16.180> more<00:05:16.300> variations<00:05:16.930> where<00:05:17.139> I've<00:05:17.289> used<00:05:17.319> the

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:17.860 
some more variations where I've used the

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:21.570 
some more variations where I've used the
log<00:05:18.069> cabin<00:05:18.370> block<00:05:18.759> to<00:05:19.479> replace<00:05:19.870> a<00:05:20.229> patch<00:05:21.099> in<00:05:21.490> a

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:21.580 
log cabin block to replace a patch in a

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:23.369 
log cabin block to replace a patch in a
quilt<00:05:21.819> block<00:05:22.029> so<00:05:22.779> if<00:05:22.840> you<00:05:22.930> look<00:05:23.080> at<00:05:23.199> this

00:05:23.369 --> 00:05:23.379 
quilt block so if you look at this

00:05:23.379 --> 00:05:25.170 
quilt block so if you look at this
square<00:05:23.740> right<00:05:23.979> here<00:05:24.039> this<00:05:24.460> is<00:05:24.610> a<00:05:24.639> traditional

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:25.180 
square right here this is a traditional

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:27.899 
square right here this is a traditional
quilt<00:05:25.479> block<00:05:26.009> that<00:05:27.009> would<00:05:27.189> have<00:05:27.279> had<00:05:27.490> maybe

00:05:27.899 --> 00:05:27.909 
quilt block that would have had maybe

00:05:27.909 --> 00:05:29.909 
quilt block that would have had maybe
two<00:05:28.240> triangles<00:05:28.779> or<00:05:28.930> a<00:05:28.960> solid<00:05:29.319> square<00:05:29.590> in<00:05:29.830> the

00:05:29.909 --> 00:05:29.919 
two triangles or a solid square in the

00:05:29.919 --> 00:05:32.219 
two triangles or a solid square in the
center<00:05:30.219> and<00:05:30.430> I've<00:05:31.000> replaced<00:05:31.419> it<00:05:31.659> with<00:05:31.719> a<00:05:31.870> log

00:05:32.219 --> 00:05:32.229 
center and I've replaced it with a log

00:05:32.229 --> 00:05:34.499 
center and I've replaced it with a log
cabin<00:05:32.650> that<00:05:32.680> I've<00:05:32.830> colored<00:05:33.190> half<00:05:33.879> brown<00:05:34.240> to

00:05:34.499 --> 00:05:34.509 
cabin that I've colored half brown to

00:05:34.509 --> 00:05:36.390 
cabin that I've colored half brown to
match<00:05:34.659> one<00:05:34.960> side<00:05:35.199> of<00:05:35.379> the<00:05:35.469> block<00:05:35.680> and<00:05:35.949> half

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:36.400 
match one side of the block and half

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:39.180 
match one side of the block and half
blue<00:05:36.669> to<00:05:36.909> match<00:05:37.000> the<00:05:37.270> other<00:05:37.419> side<00:05:38.039> so<00:05:39.039> a<00:05:39.099> little

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:39.190 
blue to match the other side so a little

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:40.920 
blue to match the other side so a little
bit<00:05:39.339> different<00:05:39.400> here<00:05:39.879> now<00:05:40.029> we're<00:05:40.270> combining

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:40.930 
bit different here now we're combining

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:47.089 
bit different here now we're combining
log<00:05:41.440> cabin<00:05:41.860> blocks<00:05:42.159> with<00:05:42.909> traditional<00:05:43.449> blocks

00:05:47.089 --> 00:05:47.099 

00:05:47.099 --> 00:05:51.959 

and<00:05:48.449> this<00:05:49.449> one<00:05:49.599> has<00:05:49.810> the<00:05:49.990> same<00:05:50.199> thing<00:05:50.969> where

00:05:51.959 --> 00:05:51.969 
and this one has the same thing where

00:05:51.969 --> 00:05:55.680 
and this one has the same thing where
I've<00:05:52.060> taken<00:05:52.089> a<00:05:52.629> traditional<00:05:52.870> block<00:05:54.659> like<00:05:55.659> a

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:55.690 
I've taken a traditional block like a

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:57.420 
I've taken a traditional block like a
bear's<00:05:55.990> paw<00:05:56.289> block<00:05:56.560> that<00:05:56.740> you<00:05:56.800> can<00:05:57.039> see<00:05:57.250> right

00:05:57.420 --> 00:05:57.430 
bear's paw block that you can see right

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:02.399 
bear's paw block that you can see right
here<00:05:57.779> and<00:05:59.669> replace<00:06:00.669> the<00:06:01.000> center<00:06:01.300> square<00:06:01.689> with

00:06:02.399 --> 00:06:02.409 
here and replace the center square with

00:06:02.409 --> 00:06:04.649 
here and replace the center square with
a<00:06:02.439> log<00:06:02.710> cabin<00:06:03.250> and<00:06:03.520> this<00:06:04.150> one<00:06:04.330> just<00:06:04.449> a<00:06:04.629> little

00:06:04.649 --> 00:06:04.659 
a log cabin and this one just a little

00:06:04.659 --> 00:06:06.929 
a log cabin and this one just a little
bit<00:06:05.110> different<00:06:05.589> instead<00:06:05.979> of<00:06:06.129> having<00:06:06.400> a<00:06:06.669> solid

00:06:06.929 --> 00:06:06.939 
bit different instead of having a solid

00:06:06.939 --> 00:06:09.659 
bit different instead of having a solid
square<00:06:07.449> in<00:06:07.689> the<00:06:07.810> center<00:06:08.169> I've<00:06:08.379> got<00:06:09.009> a<00:06:09.339> half

00:06:09.659 --> 00:06:09.669 
square in the center I've got a half

00:06:09.669 --> 00:06:12.240 
square in the center I've got a half
square<00:06:09.909> triangle<00:06:10.419> so<00:06:10.870> that<00:06:11.050> all<00:06:11.229> my<00:06:11.469> dark<00:06:12.009> side

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:12.250 
square triangle so that all my dark side

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:14.459 
square triangle so that all my dark side
looks<00:06:12.639> more<00:06:13.210> like<00:06:13.360> it<00:06:13.479> flows<00:06:13.779> in<00:06:14.020> one<00:06:14.050> triangle

00:06:14.459 --> 00:06:14.469 
looks more like it flows in one triangle

00:06:14.469 --> 00:06:17.309 
looks more like it flows in one triangle
here<00:06:15.099> and<00:06:15.219> then<00:06:15.939> I've<00:06:16.060> just<00:06:16.089> got<00:06:16.270> trying<00:06:17.110> you

00:06:17.309 --> 00:06:17.319 
here and then I've just got trying you

00:06:17.319 --> 00:06:18.659 
here and then I've just got trying you
know<00:06:17.349> just<00:06:17.560> regular<00:06:17.650> patches<00:06:18.279> here<00:06:18.460> for<00:06:18.610> the

00:06:18.659 --> 00:06:18.669 
know just regular patches here for the

00:06:18.669 --> 00:06:24.960 
know just regular patches here for the
rest<00:06:18.819> of<00:06:18.969> my<00:06:19.060> block

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:24.970 

00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:27.930 

another<00:06:25.960> one<00:06:26.200> using<00:06:27.010> the<00:06:27.280> same<00:06:27.490> thing<00:06:27.760> as<00:06:27.910> a

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:27.940 
another one using the same thing as a

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:30.810 
another one using the same thing as a
star<00:06:28.390> quilt<00:06:28.780> here<00:06:29.140> where<00:06:30.040> I've<00:06:30.190> taken<00:06:30.520> the

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:30.820 
star quilt here where I've taken the

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:34.170 
star quilt here where I've taken the
center<00:06:31.150> patch<00:06:31.390> and<00:06:31.840> used<00:06:32.800> a<00:06:33.070> courthouse<00:06:33.910> steps

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:34.180 
center patch and used a courthouse steps

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:36.390 
center patch and used a courthouse steps
variation<00:06:34.870> of<00:06:34.960> the<00:06:35.020> log<00:06:35.170> cabin<00:06:35.200> where<00:06:35.800> the<00:06:36.010> the

00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:36.400 
variation of the log cabin where the the

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:38.820 
variation of the log cabin where the the
patches<00:06:36.820> are<00:06:36.970> added<00:06:37.330> across<00:06:38.110> from<00:06:38.500> each<00:06:38.620> other

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:38.830 
patches are added across from each other

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:41.570 
patches are added across from each other
and<00:06:39.210> place<00:06:40.210> the<00:06:40.450> colors<00:06:40.780> of<00:06:40.930> the<00:06:41.020> log<00:06:41.140> cabin

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:41.580 
and place the colors of the log cabin

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:44.370 
and place the colors of the log cabin
opposite<00:06:42.580> colors<00:06:43.330> from<00:06:43.600> the<00:06:43.720> star<00:06:43.930> block<00:06:44.140> so

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:44.380 
opposite colors from the star block so

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:46.650 
opposite colors from the star block so
for<00:06:44.890> the<00:06:44.950> red<00:06:45.100> star<00:06:45.370> points<00:06:45.760> have<00:06:45.940> blue<00:06:46.420> in<00:06:46.570> the

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:46.660 
for the red star points have blue in the

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:48.630 
for the red star points have blue in the
center<00:06:46.930> of<00:06:46.960> the<00:06:47.140> log<00:06:47.290> cabin<00:06:47.530> and<00:06:47.920> the<00:06:48.490> blue

00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:48.640 
center of the log cabin and the blue

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:50.970 
center of the log cabin and the blue
star<00:06:48.880> points<00:06:49.210> have<00:06:49.360> red<00:06:49.630> so<00:06:50.230> it<00:06:50.470> just<00:06:50.680> adds<00:06:50.770> an

00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:50.980 
star points have red so it just adds an

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:52.560 
star points have red so it just adds an
interesting<00:06:51.430> variation<00:06:51.610> to<00:06:52.210> your<00:06:52.240> quilt

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:52.570 
interesting variation to your quilt

00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:54.120 
interesting variation to your quilt
designs<00:06:52.930> when<00:06:53.170> you<00:06:53.290> can<00:06:53.440> replace<00:06:53.770> an<00:06:54.010> element

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:54.130 
designs when you can replace an element

00:06:54.130 --> 00:07:01.040 
designs when you can replace an element
in<00:06:54.520> your<00:06:54.640> block<00:06:54.820> with<00:06:55.090> a<00:06:55.390> log<00:06:55.630> cabin<00:06:56.080> and

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:01.050 

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:05.250 

here's<00:07:02.050> another<00:07:02.170> example<00:07:03.870> same<00:07:04.870> type<00:07:05.110> of

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:05.260 
here's another example same type of

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:08.210 
here's another example same type of
thing<00:07:05.470> here<00:07:05.830> where<00:07:06.400> I've<00:07:06.520> got<00:07:06.700> a<00:07:06.730> log<00:07:06.970> cabin

00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:08.220 
thing here where I've got a log cabin

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:11.610 
thing here where I've got a log cabin
this<00:07:09.220> is<00:07:09.400> the<00:07:09.520> block<00:07:09.790> the<00:07:10.750> whole<00:07:10.930> block<00:07:11.170> itself

00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:11.620 
this is the block the whole block itself

00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:14.760 
this is the block the whole block itself
and<00:07:12.010> these<00:07:13.000> log<00:07:13.270> cabin<00:07:13.720> if<00:07:13.930> you<00:07:14.170> had<00:07:14.350> made<00:07:14.650> the

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:14.770 
and these log cabin if you had made the

00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:16.230 
and these log cabin if you had made the
traditional<00:07:14.920> block<00:07:15.430> these<00:07:15.940> would<00:07:16.120> be

00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:16.240 
traditional block these would be

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:18.360 
traditional block these would be
triangles<00:07:16.840> in<00:07:17.230> both<00:07:17.860> of<00:07:18.010> these<00:07:18.100> a<00:07:18.160> light

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:18.370 
triangles in both of these a light

00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:20.490 
triangles in both of these a light
triangle<00:07:18.820> dark<00:07:19.300> triangle<00:07:19.630> to<00:07:19.810> make<00:07:19.840> a<00:07:20.170> block

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:20.500 
triangle dark triangle to make a block

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:23.760 
triangle dark triangle to make a block
here<00:07:20.890> so<00:07:21.580> I've<00:07:21.670> got<00:07:21.820> four<00:07:22.060> triangle<00:07:22.770> triangles

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:23.770 
here so I've got four triangle triangles

00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:25.080 
here so I've got four triangle triangles
that<00:07:23.860> I've<00:07:23.950> replaced<00:07:24.280> with<00:07:24.550> lock<00:07:24.700> cabin

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:25.090 
that I've replaced with lock cabin

00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:27.570 
that I've replaced with lock cabin
blocks<00:07:25.330> in<00:07:25.630> the<00:07:26.110> center<00:07:26.410> of<00:07:26.500> this<00:07:26.620> block<00:07:26.860> so

00:07:27.570 --> 00:07:27.580 
blocks in the center of this block so

00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:28.800 
blocks in the center of this block so
you<00:07:27.610> can<00:07:27.790> see<00:07:27.940> it<00:07:28.030> adds<00:07:28.210> some<00:07:28.420> really<00:07:28.660> nice

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:28.810 
you can see it adds some really nice

00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:30.780 
you can see it adds some really nice
interest<00:07:29.290> in<00:07:29.440> diversity<00:07:29.919> to<00:07:30.070> your<00:07:30.220> blocks<00:07:30.490> and

00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:30.790 
interest in diversity to your blocks and

00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:34.770 
interest in diversity to your blocks and
something<00:07:31.390> fun<00:07:31.570> to<00:07:31.720> do<00:07:31.870> with<00:07:31.900> your<00:07:32.169> log<00:07:32.290> cabins
