00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.090
 year 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:11.480
 in this place were used ornaments 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:14.610
 christmas decorations as garlands 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:17.100

 of the year a decoration like this one has 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.750
 a reasonable total cost but the businesswoman 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.160

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:37.590

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.079
 As beautiful as this one with accessories. 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.480
 prices that are much more affordable than 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:45.120
 effects may be the same fine in a 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.129
 table on various cheap things that you 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.890

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:52.230
 you can see a vase with a candle 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:55.350

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:58.559
 garland and novel, that's all. 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.690

 little ones scattered on the table 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.220
 then this gives a refinement of the table the 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.470
 Glass cups can be replaced 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.780
 by colored acrylic bowls that 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.770
 It costs half the price of 9 reais 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.840
 each one 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.880
 the alternate glasses that this rest is 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.490
 silver gives way to a simpler 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.450
 red color now being contrasted with 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.060

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.080
 it's 60% cheaper goes out for some 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.780
 each one 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:27.240
 I put another option is with the fee 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:30.960
 green to give a color on the table with 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:33.479
 Christmas is very red golden silver 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.700
 green so I guess it has to be 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.530
 these colors and the napkin holders of 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.869
 have been replaced by this 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.240
 pebble red which is half the 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:44.310
 price and can still be made at home 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.840

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.210
 of 10 reais each 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:51.299

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.380
 simple beads that are super easy to 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:55.500
