00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
percent do not get hit while flying the

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:43.039 
percent do not get hit while flying the
kite<00:01:37.970> hang<00:01:38.970> glider<00:01:40.130> okay<00:01:41.159> so<00:01:41.820> that's<00:01:42.000> way<00:01:42.840> at

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
kite hang glider okay so that's way at

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.300 
kite hang glider okay so that's way at
the<00:01:43.200> end<00:01:43.350> of<00:01:43.470> the<00:01:43.530> next<00:01:43.740> video<00:01:43.979> so<00:01:44.220> you

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
the end of the next video so you

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:45.950 
the end of the next video so you
definitely<00:01:44.850> have<00:01:44.970> to<00:01:45.000> redo<00:01:45.360> a<00:01:45.390> lot<00:01:45.479> if<00:01:45.869> you

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
definitely have to redo a lot if you

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.490 
definitely have to redo a lot if you
screw<00:01:46.200> up<00:01:46.320> yes<00:01:46.920> it's<00:01:47.790> scary<00:01:48.119> but<00:01:48.899> not<00:01:49.079> as<00:01:49.200> scary

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
screw up yes it's scary but not as scary

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.260 
screw up yes it's scary but not as scary
as<00:01:49.590> the<00:01:49.770> tank<00:01:50.009> one<00:01:50.250> because<00:01:50.670> the<00:01:50.790> tank<00:01:51.030> ones

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
as the tank one because the tank ones

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.190 
as the tank one because the tank ones
insane<00:01:52.130> deal<00:01:53.130> longer<00:01:53.430> right<00:01:53.790> well<00:01:54.750> I<00:01:54.780> it's

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
insane deal longer right well I it's

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.289 
insane deal longer right well I it's
probably<00:01:55.470> just<00:01:55.590> as<00:01:55.829> long<00:01:56.070> but<00:01:56.520> it's<00:01:56.670> very<00:01:57.090> easy

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
probably just as long but it's very easy

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.469 
probably just as long but it's very easy
to<00:01:57.840> screw<00:01:58.140> that<00:01:58.320> 100%<00:01:58.799> sink<00:01:59.310> up<00:01:59.520> and<00:02:00.270> you<00:02:00.390> have

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
to screw that 100% sink up and you have

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.330 
to screw that 100% sink up and you have
to<00:02:00.570> start<00:02:00.810> from<00:02:00.869> the<00:02:00.960> beginning<00:02:01.259> but<00:02:01.590> so<00:02:02.280> I'm

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
building and from this little it looks

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:45.740 
building and from this little it looks
like<00:03:43.830> one<00:03:44.190> of<00:03:44.250> those<00:03:44.370> falling<00:03:44.700> points<00:03:45.240> you

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
like one of those falling points you

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.230 
like one of those falling points you
should<00:03:45.780> be<00:03:46.110> able<00:03:46.200> to<00:03:46.320> grab<00:03:46.590> that<00:03:46.940> ledge<00:03:47.940> I

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:48.240 
should be able to grab that ledge I

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:51.380 
should be able to grab that ledge I
don't<00:03:48.870> know<00:03:48.959> of<00:03:49.260> the<00:03:50.250> multiple<00:03:50.700> times<00:03:50.910> I<00:03:51.090> tried

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:51.390 
don't know of the multiple times I tried

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:53.510 
don't know of the multiple times I tried
it<00:03:51.570> that<00:03:52.470> was<00:03:52.620> the<00:03:52.709> first<00:03:52.920> time<00:03:53.070> it<00:03:53.250> didn't

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:53.520 
it that was the first time it didn't

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:56.960 
it that was the first time it didn't
work<00:03:54.230> but<00:03:55.230> it<00:03:56.130> looks<00:03:56.280> like<00:03:56.400> one<00:03:56.520> of<00:03:56.550> those<00:03:56.670> sync

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 
work but it looks like one of those sync

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:00.100 
work but it looks like one of those sync
points<00:03:57.360> but<00:03:57.570> you<00:03:57.870> can<00:03:58.050> make<00:03:58.200> the<00:03:58.350> jump<00:03:58.620> okay<00:03:59.430> I

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:00.110 
points but you can make the jump okay I

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:02.449 
points but you can make the jump okay I
think<00:04:01.110> to<00:04:01.470> the<00:04:01.590> right<00:04:01.620> a<00:04:01.830> bit

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:02.459 
think to the right a bit

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:04.880 
think to the right a bit
there<00:04:02.880> is<00:04:03.000> one<00:04:03.209> of<00:04:03.300> those<00:04:03.390> like<00:04:04.320> slingshot

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:04.890 
there is one of those like slingshot

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:07.580 
there is one of those like slingshot
things<00:04:05.720> it<00:04:06.720> just<00:04:06.750> lifts<00:04:07.140> you<00:04:07.200> right<00:04:07.230> up<00:04:07.380> one

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:07.590 
things it just lifts you right up one

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:13.460 
things it just lifts you right up one
more<00:04:08.160> mm-hmm<00:04:09.590> the<00:04:10.590> lift<00:04:10.830> yeah<00:04:12.230> so<00:04:13.230> here's<00:04:13.410> the

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 
more mm-hmm the lift yeah so here's the

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:16.460 
more mm-hmm the lift yeah so here's the
blueprints<00:04:14.040> or<00:04:14.940> no<00:04:15.690> maybe<00:04:15.990> I'm<00:04:16.080> thinking<00:04:16.230> go

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:16.470 
blueprints or no maybe I'm thinking go

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:18.260 
blueprints or no maybe I'm thinking go
somewhere<00:04:16.799> else<00:04:16.920> I<00:04:17.190> look<00:04:17.430> more<00:04:17.640> like<00:04:17.700> tan

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:18.270 
somewhere else I look more like tan

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:22.320 
somewhere else I look more like tan
prints<00:04:18.750> or<00:04:18.900> beige<00:04:19.080> prints

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:22.330 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:26.070 

blueprints<00:04:23.139> are<00:04:23.259> blue<00:04:24.000> and<00:04:25.000> white<00:04:25.270> you're
