00:00:10.989 --> 00:00:10.999 
you well I just tested my engine in the

00:00:10.999 --> 00:00:13.029 
you well I just tested my engine in the
works<00:00:11.240> I<00:00:11.449> use<00:00:11.719> the<00:00:11.839> pull<00:00:12.079> start<00:00:12.440> in<00:00:12.619> the<00:00:12.799> works

00:00:13.029 --> 00:00:13.039 
works I use the pull start in the works

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:15.909 
works I use the pull start in the works
well<00:00:13.940> but<00:00:14.599> it<00:00:14.959> wasn't<00:00:15.139> working<00:00:15.469> there<00:00:15.619> first

00:00:15.909 --> 00:00:15.919

00:00:51.459 --> 00:00:51.469 
something and this right here which is

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:53.619 
something and this right here which is
coming<00:00:51.679> from<00:00:51.800> your<00:00:52.100> nishan<00:00:52.489> coil<00:00:52.820> this<00:00:53.570> is

00:00:53.619 --> 00:00:53.629 
coming from your nishan coil this is

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:56.380 
coming from your nishan coil this is
your<00:00:54.109> cutoff<00:00:54.590> switch<00:00:55.160> your<00:00:55.519> on/off<00:00:55.850> switch<00:00:56.120> so

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:56.390 
your cutoff switch your on/off switch so

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:58.060 
your cutoff switch your on/off switch so
basically<00:00:56.870> what<00:00:57.050> it<00:00:57.140> is<00:00:57.230> is<00:00:57.500> while<00:00:57.739> the<00:00:57.829> engine

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:58.070 
basically what it is is while the engine

00:00:58.070 --> 00:00:59.860 
basically what it is is while the engine
is<00:00:58.129> running<00:00:58.219> you're<00:00:58.670> good<00:00:58.879> but<00:00:59.420> once<00:00:59.539> this<00:00:59.690> is

00:00:59.860 --> 00:00:59.870 
is running you're good but once this is

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:02.229 
is running you're good but once this is
grounded<00:01:00.350> to<00:01:00.649> any<00:01:01.039> kind<00:01:01.399> of<00:01:01.460> metal<00:01:01.640> it's<00:01:01.969> just

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:02.239 
grounded to any kind of metal it's just

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:05.020 
grounded to any kind of metal it's just
engine<00:01:02.539> off<00:01:02.690> so<00:01:03.350> you<00:01:03.440> could<00:01:03.710> just<00:01:04.460> mount<00:01:04.850> this

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:05.030 
engine off so you could just mount this

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:07.030 
engine off so you could just mount this
anywhere<00:01:05.570> and<00:01:05.870> it's<00:01:06.230> been<00:01:06.440> to<00:01:06.620> shut<00:01:06.800> off<00:01:06.890> your

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:07.040 
anywhere and it's been to shut off your

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.060 
anywhere and it's been to shut off your
engine<00:01:07.100> just<00:01:07.610> take<00:01:08.480> this<00:01:08.690> black<00:01:09.560> thing<00:01:09.590> right

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:10.070 
engine just take this black thing right

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:11.410 
engine just take this black thing right
here<00:01:10.250> which<00:01:10.400> is<00:01:10.550> coming<00:01:10.700> from<00:01:10.880> your<00:01:11.090> nishan

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:11.420 
here which is coming from your nishan

this<00:01:55.590> yellow<00:01:55.860> in<00:01:56.010> this<00:01:56.130> oil<00:01:56.370> since<00:01:56.700> we<00:01:57.080> can't

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:58.080 
this yellow in this oil since we can't

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:59.960 
this yellow in this oil since we can't
get<00:01:58.200> to<00:01:58.350> that<00:01:58.380> and<00:01:59.130> so<00:01:59.490> once<00:01:59.700> you<00:01:59.790> have<00:01:59.910> that

00:01:59.960 --> 00:01:59.970 
get to that and so once you have that

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:04.190 
get to that and so once you have that
connected<00:02:00.570> up<00:02:02.479> I'm<00:02:03.479> going<00:02:03.660> to<00:02:03.720> take<00:02:03.870> the<00:02:03.990> red

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
connected up I'm going to take the red

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.109 
connected up I'm going to take the red
wire<00:02:04.800> which<00:02:05.070> is<00:02:05.100> coming<00:02:05.400> from<00:02:05.550> the<00:02:05.880> starter

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 
wire which is coming from the starter

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:10.790 
wire which is coming from the starter
solenoid<00:02:09.119> and<00:02:09.720> you're<00:02:10.320> going<00:02:10.470> to<00:02:10.530> connect

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
solenoid and you're going to connect

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.240 
solenoid and you're going to connect
that<00:02:10.979> to<00:02:11.040> the<00:02:11.340> white<00:02:11.520> wires<00:02:11.760> as<00:02:12.090> well<00:02:12.390> so<00:02:13.010> in<00:02:14.010> a

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
that to the white wires as well so in a

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.070 
that to the white wires as well so in a
sense<00:02:14.520> and<00:02:14.820> show<00:02:15.120> you<00:02:15.180> in<00:02:15.360> Berkeley<00:02:15.660> is<00:02:15.720> a<00:02:15.810> park

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
sense and show you in Berkeley is a park

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.520 
sense and show you in Berkeley is a park
so<00:02:16.890> you<00:02:16.950> have<00:02:17.840> this<00:02:18.840> is<00:02:19.020> going<00:02:19.170> to<00:02:19.230> go<00:02:19.290> to<00:02:19.350> the

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
so you have this is going to go to the

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.380 
so you have this is going to go to the
positive<00:02:19.980> of<00:02:20.010> your<00:02:20.160> battery<00:02:20.489> the<00:02:20.970> student<00:02:21.270> go

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
positive of your battery the student go

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.080 
positive of your battery the student go
to<00:02:21.420> the<00:02:21.959> negative<00:02:22.320> battery<00:02:22.590> in<00:02:23.280> which<00:02:23.489> will

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
to the negative battery in which will

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:29.060 
to the negative battery in which will
spend<00:02:25.020> the<00:02:25.260> the<00:02:27.140> starter<00:02:28.140> and<00:02:28.260> to<00:02:28.709> kill<00:02:28.920> it

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
spend the the starter and to kill it

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:33.830 
spend the the starter and to kill it
just<00:02:29.250> use<00:02:30.060> this<00:02:30.360> right<00:02:30.690> here<00:02:31.020> and<00:02:32.690> touch<00:02:33.690> your

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
just use this right here and touch your

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.710 
just use this right here and touch your
engine<00:02:34.140> wait<00:02:34.320> but<00:02:35.160> let<00:02:35.310> me<00:02:35.430> up<00:02:35.600> set<00:02:36.600> this

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
engine wait but let me up set this

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.960 
engine wait but let me up set this
engine<00:02:37.050> down<00:02:37.170> so<00:02:37.500> I<00:02:37.590> can<00:02:37.770> give<00:02:38.160> it<00:02:38.190> a<00:02:38.459> stock<00:02:38.730> for

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
engine down so I can give it a stock for

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.740 
engine down so I can give it a stock for
you<00:02:39.120> all<00:02:40.040> right<00:02:41.040> I'm<00:02:41.160> using<00:02:41.370> 18<00:02:41.970> volt<00:02:42.269> battery

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
you all right I'm using 18 volt battery

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.539 
you all right I'm using 18 volt battery
right<00:02:43.019> here<00:02:43.080> got<00:02:43.590> my<00:02:43.739> ground<00:02:43.950> going<00:02:44.280> to<00:02:44.430> the

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:44.549 
right here got my ground going to the

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:46.250 
right here got my ground going to the
negative<00:02:45.000> and<00:02:45.299> this<00:02:45.510> is<00:02:45.600> my<00:02:45.690> positive<00:02:45.870> command

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
negative and this is my positive command

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:52.209 
negative and this is my positive command
right<00:02:46.500> there<00:02:47.269> I'm<00:02:48.269> gonna<00:02:48.420> sit<00:02:48.660> my

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:52.219 

00:02:52.219 --> 00:02:56.470 

mm

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:57.040 

Bravo<00:02:57.480> boots<00:03:03.080> and<00:03:04.080> here<00:03:04.860> we<00:03:04.980> go

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:57.050 

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:03.290 

and<00:03:58.050> that<00:03:58.920> is<00:03:59.130> it<00:03:59.600> it<00:04:00.600> works<00:04:00.930> and<00:04:01.620> I<00:04:02.210> think<00:04:03.210> the

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:03.300 
and that is it it works and I think the

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:05.480 
and that is it it works and I think the
reason<00:04:03.540> for<00:04:03.690> that<00:04:03.750> uh<00:04:03.870> delay<00:04:04.530> was<00:04:05.070> because<00:04:05.310> the

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:05.490 
reason for that uh delay was because the

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:06.440 
reason for that uh delay was because the
battery<00:04:05.820> that<00:04:05.970> I<00:04:06.060> use

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.450 
battery that I use

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:11.540 
battery that I use
he<00:04:07.380> said<00:04:07.590> I'm<00:04:07.740> assuming<00:04:08.220> but<00:04:09.090> uh<00:04:10.340> that<00:04:11.340> should

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:11.550 
he said I'm assuming but uh that should

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:12.490 
he said I'm assuming but uh that should
be<00:04:11.640> it

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:12.500 
be it

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:17.570 
be it
and<00:04:14.810> if<00:04:15.810> I<00:04:15.960> have<00:04:16.080> any<00:04:16.290> questions<00:04:16.680> just<00:04:17.400> let<00:04:17.519> me

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:17.580
