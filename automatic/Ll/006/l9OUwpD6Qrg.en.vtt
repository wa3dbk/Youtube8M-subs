seal<00:02:22.590> an<00:02:22.740> end<00:02:22.890> forever<00:02:23.330> permanently<00:02:24.830> now<00:02:25.970> when

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
seal an end forever permanently now when

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.050

you don't want to touch these

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.340 
you don't want to touch these
controllers<00:02:31.230> for<00:02:31.590> at<00:02:31.770> least<00:02:32.100> a<00:02:32.490> week<00:02:33.200> let<00:02:34.200> them

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
controllers for at least a week let them

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:36.520 
controllers for at least a week let them
sit<00:02:34.650> if<00:02:34.860> you<00:02:35.220> can<00:02:35.430> bake<00:02:35.820> them<00:02:36.000> in<00:02:36.060> the<00:02:36.180> Sun

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
sit if you can bake them in the Sun

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:39.050 
sit if you can bake them in the Sun
everything<00:02:37.530> else<00:02:37.680> just<00:02:37.800> let<00:02:38.220> them<00:02:38.490> sit<00:02:38.760> for<00:02:38.820> a

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
everything else just let them sit for a

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.900 
everything else just let them sit for a
week<00:02:39.500> once<00:02:40.500> that<00:02:40.710> happens<00:02:41.130> you<00:02:41.250> can<00:02:41.460> play<00:02:41.730> with

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
week once that happens you can play with

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:45.200 
week once that happens you can play with
it<00:02:41.970> whatever<00:02:43.100> put<00:02:44.100> it<00:02:44.190> together<00:02:44.310> whatever<00:02:44.700> but

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:45.210 
it whatever put it together whatever but

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:48.560 
it whatever put it together whatever but
just<00:02:45.240> let<00:02:45.570> it<00:02:45.690> sit<00:02:45.870> for<00:02:45.900> a<00:02:46.110> week<00:02:46.310> and<00:02:47.310> I<00:02:48.060> think

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570 
just let it sit for a week and I think

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:49.670 
just let it sit for a week and I think
that's<00:02:48.750> pretty<00:02:48.990> much<00:02:49.080> all<00:02:49.230> I'm<00:02:49.380> going<00:02:49.470> to<00:02:49.530> do

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
that's pretty much all I'm going to do

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.800 
that's pretty much all I'm going to do

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
for how to mask and how to get some

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:58.790 
for how to mask and how to get some
pretty<00:02:54.900> cool<00:02:55.050> designs<00:02:55.440> see<00:02:56.340> you<00:02:56.430> guys<00:02:56.550> later
