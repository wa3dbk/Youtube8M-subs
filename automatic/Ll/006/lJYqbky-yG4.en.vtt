00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
you've got like I said writers block

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.389 
you've got like I said writers block
wild<00:02:03.149> cards<00:02:03.540> which<00:02:03.689> actually<00:02:03.930> show<00:02:04.320> you<00:02:04.399> which

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
wild cards which actually show you which

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:06.630 
wild cards which actually show you which
actually

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640 
actually

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.980 
actually
so<00:02:07.679> substitute<00:02:08.679> letters<00:02:09.240> you<00:02:10.240> got<00:02:10.390> the<00:02:10.539> cycler

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:10.990 
so substitute letters you got the cycler

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:13.559 
so substitute letters you got the cycler
which<00:02:11.200> also<00:02:11.500> which<00:02:11.890> goes<00:02:12.220> from<00:02:12.250> a<00:02:12.760> to<00:02:12.790> b<00:02:13.150> to<00:02:13.180> see

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569 
which also which goes from a to b to see

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:15.900 
which also which goes from a to b to see
that<00:02:13.810> the<00:02:14.080> D<00:02:14.260> to<00:02:14.470> E<00:02:14.500> to<00:02:14.830> F<00:02:14.860> so<00:02:15.340> basically<00:02:15.790> the

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
that the D to E to F so basically the

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:17.190 
that the D to E to F so basically the
letters<00:02:16.209> and<00:02:16.360> the<00:02:16.420> letter<00:02:16.750> constantly

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
letters and the letter constantly

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.220 
letters and the letter constantly
changes<00:02:17.770> this<00:02:18.280> one<00:02:18.490> here<00:02:18.730> is<00:02:18.760> a<00:02:18.940> lock<00:02:19.209> lock<00:02:19.930> box

basically you know their new letters
sometimes<00:03:34.000> you<00:03:34.269> might<00:03:34.360> get<00:03:34.510> the<00:03:34.600> same<00:03:34.750> ones

the<00:04:30.930> arcade<00:04:31.440> the<00:04:31.680> arcade<00:04:32.070> is<00:04:32.250> time<00:04:32.520> you<00:04:32.790> have<00:04:32.910> a

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:32.940 
the arcade the arcade is time you have a

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:35.000 
the arcade the arcade is time you have a
little<00:04:33.150> timer<00:04:33.540> going<00:04:34.110> across<00:04:34.410> and<00:04:34.710> that's

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:35.010 
little timer going across and that's

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:36.710 
little timer going across and that's
pretty<00:04:35.190> much<00:04:35.310> it<00:04:35.460> now<00:04:35.970> as<00:04:36.150> you<00:04:36.180> as<00:04:36.449> you<00:04:36.479> know

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:36.720 
pretty much it now as you as you know

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:38.210 
pretty much it now as you as you know
this<00:04:36.930> is<00:04:36.960> the<00:04:37.169> first<00:04:37.199> level<00:04:37.620> so<00:04:37.860> it's<00:04:37.979> not<00:04:38.100> too

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:38.220 
this is the first level so it's not too

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:41.659 
this is the first level so it's not too
complicated<00:04:38.430> but<00:04:39.470> you<00:04:40.470> will<00:04:40.680> get<00:04:40.860> it'll<00:04:41.490> get

00:04:41.659 --> 00:04:41.669 
complicated but you will get it'll get

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:43.400 
complicated but you will get it'll get
harder<00:04:42.030> but<00:04:42.210> you<00:04:42.360> are<00:04:42.479> playing<00:04:42.840> on<00:04:43.050> where<00:04:43.380> I

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:43.410 
harder but you are playing on where I

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:44.600 
harder but you are playing on where I
play<00:04:43.620> and<00:04:43.770> depending<00:04:44.039> on<00:04:44.130> the<00:04:44.190> level<00:04:44.430> of

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:44.610 
play and depending on the level of

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:46.879 
play and depending on the level of
difficulty<00:04:45.000> see<00:04:45.840> let's<00:04:46.620> say<00:04:46.710> for<00:04:46.860> example

00:04:46.879 --> 00:04:46.889 
difficulty see let's say for example

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:49.100 
difficulty see let's say for example
that<00:04:47.430> one<00:04:47.820> there<00:04:48.030> i<00:04:48.060> just<00:04:48.300> made<00:04:48.479> a<00:04:48.510> word<00:04:48.780> cause

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:49.110 
that one there i just made a word cause

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:52.370 
that one there i just made a word cause
II<00:04:49.260> and<00:04:49.440> then<00:04:50.340> just<00:04:50.520> go<00:04:50.639> submit<00:04:51.030> and<00:04:51.330> as<00:04:52.289> you

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:52.380 
II and then just go submit and as you

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:54.170 
II and then just go submit and as you
can<00:04:52.500> see<00:04:52.530> that<00:04:52.830> grew<00:04:53.070> out<00:04:53.100> that<00:04:53.460> section<00:04:53.910> that

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:54.180 
can see that grew out that section that

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:56.990 
can see that grew out that section that
section<00:04:54.840> up<00:04:54.930> there<00:04:54.960> has<00:04:55.289> now<00:04:55.440> become<00:04:55.650> green<00:04:56.160> so

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:57.000 
section up there has now become green so

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.210 
section up there has now become green so
it<00:04:57.270> basically<00:04:57.389> tells<00:04:57.990> you<00:04:58.199> that<00:04:58.470> you<00:04:58.949> know<00:04:59.070> go

00:04:59.210 --> 00:04:59.220 
it basically tells you that you know go

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:01.040 
it basically tells you that you know go
ahead<00:04:59.460> make<00:04:59.639> some<00:04:59.850> more<00:04:59.970> words<00:05:00.240> words<00:05:00.600> must<00:05:00.870> be

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:01.050 
ahead make some more words words must be

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:03.620 
ahead make some more words words must be
at<00:05:01.229> least<00:05:01.530> three<00:05:02.160> characters<00:05:02.820> long<00:05:03.030> but<00:05:03.539> if

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:03.630 
at least three characters long but if

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:05.719 
at least three characters long but if
you<00:05:03.720> once<00:05:04.320> you<00:05:04.470> move<00:05:04.680> on<00:05:04.860> to<00:05:04.979> the<00:05:05.070> next<00:05:05.100> level

00:05:05.719 --> 00:05:05.729 
you once you move on to the next level

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:07.490 
you once you move on to the next level
for<00:05:05.970> example<00:05:06.360> I<00:05:06.449> can<00:05:06.510> make<00:05:06.780> this<00:05:06.960> letter<00:05:07.229> here

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:07.500 
for example I can make this letter here

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:09.469 
for example I can make this letter here
I<00:05:07.530> come<00:05:07.770> just<00:05:07.919> do<00:05:08.100> that<00:05:08.130> art<00:05:08.520> and<00:05:08.850> submit<00:05:09.449> it

00:05:09.469 --> 00:05:09.479 
I come just do that art and submit it

00:05:09.479 --> 00:05:13.040 
I come just do that art and submit it
and<00:05:09.750> it<00:05:10.590> will<00:05:10.740> as<00:05:11.639> I<00:05:11.669> said<00:05:11.940> it's<00:05:12.090> just<00:05:12.630> it's

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:13.050 
and it will as I said it's just it's

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:15.200 
and it will as I said it's just it's
just<00:05:13.110> made<00:05:13.440> that<00:05:13.590> section<00:05:14.310> green<00:05:14.550> but<00:05:15.030> you've

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:15.210 
just made that section green but you've

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:17.060 
just made that section green but you've
got<00:05:15.450> to<00:05:15.479> try<00:05:15.750> and<00:05:15.900> make<00:05:16.080> letters<00:05:16.410> a<00:05:16.560> little<00:05:16.950> bit

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:17.070 
got to try and make letters a little bit

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:19.250 
got to try and make letters a little bit
more<00:05:17.250> bigger<00:05:17.760> than<00:05:18.000> three<00:05:18.389> because<00:05:18.810> if<00:05:19.110> you

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:19.260 
more bigger than three because if you

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.050 
more bigger than three because if you
don't<00:05:19.500> you<00:05:19.860> will<00:05:19.979> get<00:05:20.130> that<00:05:20.310> writer's<00:05:20.789> block

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:21.060 
don't you will get that writer's block

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:22.550 
don't you will get that writer's block
and<00:05:21.300> the<00:05:21.450> writer's<00:05:21.810> block<00:05:21.990> will<00:05:22.229> get<00:05:22.410> in<00:05:22.530> the

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:22.560 
and the writer's block will get in the

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:24.170 
and the writer's block will get in the
way<00:05:22.650> so<00:05:22.830> if<00:05:23.160> it<00:05:23.370> gets<00:05:23.580> right<00:05:23.820> in<00:05:23.940> the<00:05:24.000> middle

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:24.180 
way so if it gets right in the middle

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:26.390 
way so if it gets right in the middle
right<00:05:24.270> there<00:05:24.690> you<00:05:25.169> won't<00:05:25.349> be<00:05:25.410> able<00:05:25.500> to<00:05:25.740> use<00:05:25.770> any

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:26.400 
right there you won't be able to use any

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:28.070 
right there you won't be able to use any
letters<00:05:26.880> that<00:05:27.060> are<00:05:27.180> in<00:05:27.450> the<00:05:27.599> middle<00:05:27.780> of<00:05:27.930> that

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:28.080 
letters that are in the middle of that

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:29.450 
letters that are in the middle of that
and<00:05:28.260> if<00:05:28.380> you've<00:05:28.500> got<00:05:28.680> to<00:05:28.770> make<00:05:28.889> a<00:05:28.919> letter<00:05:29.220> out

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:29.460 
and if you've got to make a letter out

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:30.710 
and if you've got to make a letter out
of<00:05:29.610> that<00:05:29.789> that's<00:05:30.030> going<00:05:30.180> to<00:05:30.270> be<00:05:30.330> harder<00:05:30.690> for

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:30.720 
of that that's going to be harder for

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:32.870 
of that that's going to be harder for
you<00:05:30.930> to<00:05:30.960> do<00:05:31.200> so<00:05:31.919> that's<00:05:32.070> pretty<00:05:32.310> much<00:05:32.400> how<00:05:32.849> you

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:32.880

bottom here you've got a bar and that's

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:01.279 
bottom here you've got a bar and that's
a<00:05:59.400> timer<00:05:59.700> so<00:06:00.060> pretty<00:06:00.539> much<00:06:00.690> you<00:06:00.930> can<00:06:01.050> continue

00:06:01.279 --> 00:06:01.289 
a timer so pretty much you can continue

00:06:01.289 --> 00:06:02.839 
a timer so pretty much you can continue
playing<00:06:01.620> from<00:06:01.860> where<00:06:02.010> you<00:06:02.099> left<00:06:02.400> off<00:06:02.610> last

00:06:02.839 --> 00:06:02.849 
playing from where you left off last

00:06:02.849 --> 00:06:05.180 
playing from where you left off last
time<00:06:03.060> and<00:06:03.479> you<00:06:03.510> can<00:06:04.229> continue<00:06:04.530> playing<00:06:04.889> from

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:05.190 
time and you can continue playing from

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:07.279 
time and you can continue playing from
there<00:06:05.400> now<00:06:05.699> if<00:06:05.910> you<00:06:06.030> do<00:06:06.180> create<00:06:06.479> big<00:06:06.930> letter

00:06:07.279 --> 00:06:07.289 
there now if you do create big letter

00:06:07.289 --> 00:06:10.430 
there now if you do create big letter
big<00:06:07.830> lettered<00:06:08.190> words<00:06:08.430> that<00:06:09.300> timer<00:06:09.720> will<00:06:10.169> go

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:10.440 
big lettered words that timer will go

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:13.460 
big lettered words that timer will go
backwards<00:06:11.099> as<00:06:11.370> well<00:06:11.849> so<00:06:12.570> that's<00:06:13.050> a<00:06:13.229> good<00:06:13.410> thing

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:13.470 
backwards as well so that's a good thing

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:15.140 
backwards as well so that's a good thing
as<00:06:13.800> good<00:06:14.280> that's<00:06:14.490> a<00:06:14.580> good<00:06:14.729> thing<00:06:14.849> about<00:06:15.000> this

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:15.150 
as good that's a good thing about this

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:16.640 
as good that's a good thing about this
is<00:06:15.300> also<00:06:15.599> fun<00:06:15.870> because<00:06:16.169> if<00:06:16.289> you<00:06:16.380> think<00:06:16.409> about

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:16.650 
is also fun because if you think about

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:18.950 
is also fun because if you think about
it<00:06:16.830> you<00:06:17.039> cannot<00:06:17.310> you<00:06:17.520> can<00:06:17.669> also<00:06:17.820> just<00:06:18.690> time

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:18.960 
it you cannot you can also just time

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:20.100 
it you cannot you can also just time
yourself<00:06:19.169> and

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:20.110 
yourself and

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:22.190 
yourself and
get<00:06:20.230> yourself<00:06:20.560> thinking<00:06:21.370> so<00:06:21.700> for<00:06:22.030> example

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:22.200 
get yourself thinking so for example

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:27.570 
get yourself thinking so for example
tele2<00:06:23.760> MIT<00:06:24.760> and<00:06:25.740> that's<00:06:26.740> how<00:06:26.890> it<00:06:26.950> works<00:06:27.130> so<00:06:27.430> if

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:27.580 
tele2 MIT and that's how it works so if

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:29.100 
tele2 MIT and that's how it works so if
you've<00:06:27.700> got<00:06:27.730> basically<00:06:28.000> a<00:06:28.360> five-letter<00:06:28.870> work

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:29.110 
you've got basically a five-letter work

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:30.990 
you've got basically a five-letter work
that<00:06:29.470> time<00:06:29.800> it<00:06:30.040> would<00:06:30.190> move<00:06:30.400> back<00:06:30.430> a<00:06:30.730> little

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:31.000 
that time it would move back a little

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.180 
that time it would move back a little
bit<00:06:31.210> but<00:06:31.750> if<00:06:31.900> not<00:06:32.080> it<00:06:32.410> will<00:06:32.500> continue<00:06:32.860> going

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:33.190 
bit but if not it will continue going

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:34.770 
bit but if not it will continue going
down<00:06:33.520> and<00:06:33.790> down<00:06:33.820> and<00:06:33.970> down<00:06:34.180> until<00:06:34.270> the<00:06:34.630> time

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:34.780 
down and down and down until the time

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:37.230 
down and down and down until the time
runs<00:06:34.960> out<00:06:35.110> and<00:06:35.290> then<00:06:35.530> the<00:06:35.620> game's<00:06:35.800> over<00:06:36.240> let's

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:37.240 
runs out and then the game's over let's

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:41.490 
runs out and then the game's over let's
just<00:06:37.420> jump<00:06:37.570> back<00:06:37.630> out<00:06:37.930> there<00:06:39.330> oops<00:06:40.330> just<00:06:41.290> jump
