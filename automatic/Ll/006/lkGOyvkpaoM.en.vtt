millimeter headphone jack so there you

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:13.950 
millimeter headphone jack so there you
have<00:01:11.020> it<00:01:11.460> we'll<00:01:12.460> go<00:01:12.580> to<00:01:12.640> the<00:01:12.850> back<00:01:13.090> actually<00:01:13.720> so

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:13.960 
have it we'll go to the back actually so

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.950 
have it we'll go to the back actually so
the<00:01:14.170> back<00:01:14.380> uses<00:01:14.920> a<00:01:15.070> five<00:01:15.520> megapixel<00:01:15.960> camera

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:20.350 
the camera does not use autofocus and it

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:23.999 
the camera does not use autofocus and it
does<00:01:20.560> take<00:01:20.860> video<00:01:21.460> of<00:01:22.079> just<00:01:23.079> VGA<00:01:23.439> video<00:01:23.619> so

00:01:23.999 --> 00:01:24.009 
does take video of just VGA video so

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:26.550 
does take video of just VGA video so
it's<00:01:24.159> not<00:01:24.340> HD<00:01:24.880> video<00:01:25.180> on<00:01:25.450> the<00:01:25.960> curve<00:01:26.140> finally

improvement<00:01:29.229> over<00:01:29.500> all<00:01:29.680> the<00:01:29.860> previous

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:30.189 
improvement over all the previous

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:32.399

generation curved phones which never had
a<00:01:32.439> flash<00:01:32.740> so<00:01:33.040> it's<00:01:33.220> nice<00:01:33.399> to<00:01:33.579> have<00:01:33.700> that<00:01:33.880> will

the speaker quality on this phone this
one<00:02:30.630> does<00:02:30.780> utilize<00:02:31.020> 512<00:02:31.980> megabytes<00:02:32.520> of

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
one does utilize 512 megabytes of

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.900 
one does utilize 512 megabytes of
built-in<00:02:33.620> memory<00:02:34.620> so<00:02:35.130> that's<00:02:35.430> nice<00:02:35.640> to<00:02:35.670> have

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
built-in memory so that's nice to have

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.660 
built-in memory so that's nice to have
as<00:02:36.150> well<00:02:36.620> I'm<00:02:37.620> just<00:02:37.770> going<00:02:37.950> to<00:02:38.010> zoom<00:02:38.190> out<00:02:38.340> here

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
as well I'm just going to zoom out here

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.700 
as well I'm just going to zoom out here
and<00:02:38.820> we're<00:02:39.540> going<00:02:39.630> to<00:02:39.690> do<00:02:39.900> a<00:02:39.930> little<00:02:40.200> bit<00:02:40.410> of<00:02:40.560> a

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:40.710 
and we're going to do a little bit of a

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:44.210 
and we're going to do a little bit of a
physical<00:02:41.610> comparison<00:02:42.210> to<00:02:42.450> my<00:02:42.870> iPhone<00:02:43.350> 4s<00:02:43.650> just

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
physical comparison to my iPhone 4s just

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.220 
physical comparison to my iPhone 4s just
so<00:02:44.280> you<00:02:44.400> guys<00:02:44.550> can<00:02:44.820> get<00:02:44.910> an<00:02:45.060> idea<00:02:45.420> of<00:02:45.720> the<00:02:45.960> size

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
so you guys can get an idea of the size

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.500 
so you guys can get an idea of the size
of<00:02:46.530> this<00:02:46.770> phone<00:02:47.010> so<00:02:47.940> there<00:02:48.180> we<00:02:48.300> go

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
of this phone so there we go

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.510 
of this phone so there we go
so<00:02:48.900> you<00:02:48.960> can<00:02:49.110> see<00:02:49.290> the<00:02:49.470> 4s<00:02:49.740> is<00:02:50.100> quite<00:02:50.310> a<00:02:50.340> bit

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:50.520 
so you can see the 4s is quite a bit

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:54.170 
so you can see the 4s is quite a bit
longer<00:02:51.530> in<00:02:52.530> thickness

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
longer in thickness

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.750 
longer in thickness
it<00:02:54.390> looks<00:02:54.660> like<00:02:54.810> the<00:02:55.020> 4s<00:02:55.590> is<00:02:55.890> slightly<00:02:56.310> thinner

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
it looks like the 4s is slightly thinner

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.660 
it looks like the 4s is slightly thinner
but<00:02:57.660> I<00:02:58.080> mean<00:02:58.350> for<00:02:58.560> a<00:02:58.590> blackberry<00:02:59.220> having<00:02:59.580> a

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
aside this brand new curve from rim does

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.750 
aside this brand new curve from rim does
utilize<00:03:09.270> an<00:03:09.600> 800<00:03:10.200> megahertz<00:03:10.470> processor<00:03:10.860> which

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
utilize an 800 megahertz processor which

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.330 
utilize an 800 megahertz processor which
is<00:03:11.790> a<00:03:11.940> huge<00:03:12.270> improvement<00:03:12.570> over<00:03:13.110> the<00:03:13.340> 624

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
is a huge improvement over the 624

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.370 
is a huge improvement over the 624
megahertz<00:03:15.000> processor<00:03:15.210> on<00:03:15.780> the<00:03:15.810> previous

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.380 
megahertz processor on the previous

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:19.010 
megahertz processor on the previous
generation<00:03:16.560> curve<00:03:17.280> the<00:03:18.090> curve<00:03:18.270> does<00:03:18.480> use<00:03:18.750> also

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:19.020 
generation curve the curve does use also

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:22.760 
generation curve the curve does use also
now<00:03:19.470> OS<00:03:20.040> 7<00:03:20.520> so<00:03:21.030> the<00:03:21.870> previous<00:03:22.140> generation

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:22.770 
now OS 7 so the previous generation

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:25.580 
now OS 7 so the previous generation
curves<00:03:23.070> used<00:03:23.310> the<00:03:23.460> OS<00:03:23.820> 5<00:03:24.120> and<00:03:24.420> os<00:03:24.690> 6<00:03:25.050> but<00:03:25.470> this

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
curves used the OS 5 and os 6 but this

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:28.160 
curves used the OS 5 and os 6 but this
one<00:03:25.800> does<00:03:26.010> now<00:03:26.220> use<00:03:26.520> the<00:03:26.700> OS<00:03:27.030> 7<00:03:27.450> so<00:03:27.900> you<00:03:27.990> can

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
one does now use the OS 7 so you can

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:30.200 
one does now use the OS 7 so you can
definitely<00:03:28.320> see<00:03:28.680> the<00:03:28.710> icons<00:03:29.280> are<00:03:29.550> quite<00:03:29.970> a<00:03:30.000> bit

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:30.210 
definitely see the icons are quite a bit

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:32.330 
definitely see the icons are quite a bit
more<00:03:30.390> colorful<00:03:30.750> a<00:03:31.230> little<00:03:31.620> bit<00:03:31.740> more<00:03:31.890> detail

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
more colorful a little bit more detail

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:35.090 
more colorful a little bit more detail
on<00:03:32.550> the<00:03:32.760> icons<00:03:33.180> which<00:03:33.540> is<00:03:33.720> nice<00:03:33.900> to<00:03:34.050> have<00:03:34.230> the

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:35.100 
on the icons which is nice to have the

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:38.300 
on the icons which is nice to have the
rim<00:03:35.280> has<00:03:35.460> also<00:03:35.640> got<00:03:36.000> rid<00:03:36.180> of<00:03:36.240> the<00:03:37.310> scrolling

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
rim has also got rid of the scrolling

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:40.460 
rim has also got rid of the scrolling
through<00:03:38.520> so<00:03:38.820> before<00:03:39.450> you<00:03:39.600> are<00:03:39.690> able<00:03:39.870> to<00:03:40.170> scroll

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
through so before you are able to scroll

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:42.590 
through so before you are able to scroll
through<00:03:40.500> side<00:03:40.980> to<00:03:41.160> side<00:03:41.400> you<00:03:42.090> can<00:03:42.240> still<00:03:42.450> do

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:42.600 
through side to side you can still do

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:45.410 
through side to side you can still do
that<00:03:42.630> on<00:03:42.930> OS<00:03:43.230> 7<00:03:43.620> but<00:03:43.950> now<00:03:44.550> you<00:03:44.610> have<00:03:44.880> the<00:03:45.000> option

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.420 
that on OS 7 but now you have the option

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:16.200 
as you can see it brings up the mobile
version<00:05:13.830> and<00:05:14.830> the<00:05:15.010> browser<00:05:15.220> is<00:05:15.430> not<00:05:15.610> too<00:05:15.790> bad<00:05:15.970> I

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:19.800

mean it's the OS 7 browser I find it a

mean it's the OS 7 browser I find it a
little<00:05:20.320> bit<00:05:20.560> difficult<00:05:20.800> to<00:05:21.160> use<00:05:21.520> without<00:05:21.850> the

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:22.090 
little bit difficult to use without the

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:24.780 
little bit difficult to use without the
touchscreen<00:05:22.630> but<00:05:23.110> for<00:05:23.770> a<00:05:23.980> non<00:05:24.190> touchscreen

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:24.790 
touchscreen but for a non touchscreen

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:27.150 
touchscreen but for a non touchscreen
device<00:05:25.090> it's<00:05:25.960> definitely<00:05:26.530> one<00:05:26.710> of<00:05:26.740> the<00:05:26.950> best

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:27.160 
device it's definitely one of the best

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:29.490 
device it's definitely one of the best
browsers<00:05:27.670> out<00:05:27.880> there<00:05:28.120> so<00:05:28.390> if<00:05:28.960> this<00:05:29.170> is<00:05:29.350> your

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:29.500
