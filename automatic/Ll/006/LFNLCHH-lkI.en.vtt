00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 now we go there to the states 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:06.200
 united to take a ride aboard two 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.550
 sports a vibrant experience 

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:13.650
 especially for those who put their hands 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:14.639
 car speaks and played until from afar is almost 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.960
 a mirage 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:21.689
 a dash cutting the road near the 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.350
 illusion wins name is the car bodice 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.350
 chevrolet sport 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:31.670
 here in the United States when people 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:36.110
 speaks of speed soon comes to mind and 

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:38.540
 corvette z06 for example it has 500 and 5 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:40.220
 horsepower now it's for 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:42.530
 believe that cadillac marks 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:44.420
 traditional car has 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:47.150
 a model that has a more powerful engine 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:49.989
 that converts because it is the cts-v o 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:55.540
 fastest cadillac of all time 

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:57.830
 to 0 so less than four seconds 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:58.790
 this is a mechanical model of six 

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:00.949
 marches 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:03.080
 but there is also the automatic version 

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:04.699
 breaking the tradition of sports 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:08.060
 luxury does not match 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:11.060
 the cts v you accelerate the world is to 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:13.550
 Do not continue to accelerate this car. 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:18.830
 300 km per hour 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:21.010
 after all he has a 6.2 v8 with 556 horses 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:21.010
 power 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:27.820
 think that in the past to get to 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.820
 30 kilometers per hour was already difficult 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:35.070
 the centennial search for speed and 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.020
 efficiency is documented in detroit 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.600
 at museum of general motorcycles 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:42.090
 the owner of the house of laki a cylinder and 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.460
 only six and a half horsepower 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:48.180
 this is the engine of hana bucket manufactured 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:50.420
 in 1902 the first cadillac and history 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.420
 it's long 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:02:00.060
 the models inspired by the carriages and 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:02.250
 erosion and no drawdowns in 10 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.399
 headlamps and leaflets integrated 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.399
 bodywork 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:11.570
 the unforgettable fish tail 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:19.060
 vix and I like the space race 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:20.470
 But now forget the darling of a darling. 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.720
 of the rich and famous 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:27.610
 Cadillac business is at this moment 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:31.630
 fight and fight with the greats of the 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:37.870
 his branch w Mercedes and Audi here that the 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:46.630
 cts v shows the rhythm muscles inside 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:50.100
 comfort and refinement and space technology 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:51.640
 even to settle in the back seat 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:53.740
 outside 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:59.800
 draws attention to the rear in this resumption 

00:02:53.740 --> 00:03:04.750
 two exhaust coupes in the middle of 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:07.360
 immense antennae and a giant break light 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:11.680
 not to lose the mania of exaggeration at last 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:14.110
 is a cadillac this story ends with 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:16.390
 the collaboration of the American police and 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:18.990
 security eye closed the highway for 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:18.990
 some minutes 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:27.890
 it's dude 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:36.189
 so the reporter producer could 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:40.560
 show two crown jewels 

00:03:36.189 --> 00:03:44.170
 sports side by side the chance 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:46.659
 sending way of saying because in an hour 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:49.950
 to deal with how many horses and 

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:49.950
 causes a flying machine
