hi<00:00:00.800> I'm<00:00:01.800> very<00:00:02.040> conscious<00:00:02.550> that<00:00:02.580> it's<00:00:03.570> taken<00:00:03.899> me

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:03.990 
hi I'm very conscious that it's taken me

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:06.950 
hi I'm very conscious that it's taken me
a<00:00:04.020> long<00:00:04.230> time<00:00:04.290> to<00:00:04.890> make<00:00:05.609> this<00:00:05.910> follow-up<00:00:06.569> to<00:00:06.839> my

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
a long time to make this follow-up to my

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.470 
a long time to make this follow-up to my
first<00:00:07.259> video<00:00:08.099> after<00:00:08.639> the<00:00:08.730> removal<00:00:09.030> of<00:00:09.300> my

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
first video after the removal of my

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.999 
first video after the removal of my
metal<00:00:10.880> which<00:00:11.880> itself<00:00:12.750> was<00:00:12.870> placed<00:00:13.440> as<00:00:13.799> a

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
metal which itself was placed as a

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.970 
metal which itself was placed as a
result<00:00:14.400> of<00:00:14.610> a<00:00:14.759> tibial<00:00:15.360> plateau<00:00:15.839> fracture

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
result of a tibial plateau fracture

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.820 
result of a tibial plateau fracture
I<00:00:17.210> had<00:00:18.210> the<00:00:18.330> metal<00:00:18.660> removed<00:00:19.020> on<00:00:19.260> the<00:00:19.410> fourth<00:00:19.650> of

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
I had the metal removed on the fourth of

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.019 
I had the metal removed on the fourth of
December<00:00:19.890> and<00:00:20.580> it's<00:00:21.570> now<00:00:21.779> the<00:00:22.519> 26th<00:00:23.519> of<00:00:23.640> June

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
December and it's now the 26th of June

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.580 
December and it's now the 26th of June
of<00:00:24.480> the<00:00:25.199> following<00:00:25.230> year<00:00:25.619> I've<00:00:26.609> just<00:00:26.849> turned

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:27.590 
of the following year I've just turned

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:33.020 
of the following year I've just turned
49<00:00:28.590> and<00:00:29.090> as<00:00:30.090> I<00:00:30.539> said<00:00:30.810> in<00:00:30.990> my<00:00:31.019> video<00:00:31.470> in<00:00:32.030> December

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
49 and as I said in my video in December

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.500 
49 and as I said in my video in December
I<00:00:33.059> felt<00:00:33.809> good<00:00:33.989> about<00:00:34.170> the<00:00:34.910> removal<00:00:35.910> and<00:00:36.149> I<00:00:36.300> just

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
I felt good about the removal and I just

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:37.970 
I felt good about the removal and I just
want<00:00:36.630> to<00:00:36.660> give<00:00:36.809> you<00:00:36.840> an<00:00:36.989> update<00:00:37.110> on<00:00:37.500> what<00:00:37.829> my

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
want to give you an update on what my

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.500 
want to give you an update on what my
leg<00:00:38.160> looks<00:00:38.370> like<00:00:38.610> and<00:00:38.879> how<00:00:38.969> I'm<00:00:39.090> feeling<00:00:39.420> about

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
leg looks like and how I'm feeling about

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.090 
leg looks like and how I'm feeling about
it<00:00:39.690> now<00:00:40.579> six<00:00:41.579> months<00:00:41.820> later<00:00:42.680> as<00:00:43.680> I<00:00:43.770> said<00:00:43.950> at<00:00:44.040> the

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
it now six months later as I said at the

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.799 
it now six months later as I said at the
time<00:00:44.340> it<00:00:44.879> was<00:00:45.030> a<00:00:45.059> perhaps<00:00:45.300> a<00:00:45.480> bit<00:00:45.629> premature

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
time it was a perhaps a bit premature

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.330 
time it was a perhaps a bit premature
for<00:00:46.230> me<00:00:46.289> to<00:00:46.379> say<00:00:46.649> it<00:00:46.770> but<00:00:46.829> I<00:00:46.980> was<00:00:47.160> really

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
for me to say it but I was really

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.900 
for me to say it but I was really
advocating<00:00:48.180> the<00:00:48.270> removal<00:00:48.750> of<00:00:48.870> the<00:00:49.050> metal<00:00:49.410> and

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:49.910 
advocating the removal of the metal and

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:55.939 
advocating the removal of the metal and
I<00:00:50.910> still<00:00:51.780> really<00:00:52.379> advocate<00:00:53.039> that<00:00:53.750> the<00:00:54.949> removal

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
I still really advocate that the removal

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.610 
I still really advocate that the removal
of<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.309> metal<00:00:56.610> for<00:00:56.789> me<00:00:56.940> meant<00:00:57.239> two<00:00:57.600> things<00:00:57.629> one

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
of the metal for me meant two things one

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.029 
of the metal for me meant two things one
it<00:00:58.800> took<00:00:59.129> out<00:00:59.340> this<00:01:00.239> encumbrance<00:01:01.170> in<00:01:01.440> my<00:01:01.770> leg

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
it took out this encumbrance in my leg

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.170 
it took out this encumbrance in my leg
which<00:01:02.280> I<00:01:02.430> could<00:01:02.640> sort<00:01:03.390> of<00:01:04.040> psychologically

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:05.180 
which I could sort of psychologically

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:10.750 
which I could sort of psychologically
know<00:01:06.180> obviously<00:01:07.170> was<00:01:07.890> there<00:01:08.220> but<00:01:08.900> also<00:01:09.900> just

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:10.760 
know obviously was there but also just

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:15.140 
know obviously was there but also just
intuitively<00:01:11.760> feel<00:01:12.630> that<00:01:13.430> was<00:01:14.430> always<00:01:15.000> going

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
intuitively feel that was always going

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.679 
intuitively feel that was always going
to<00:01:15.180> prevent<00:01:15.450> me<00:01:15.570> making<00:01:16.020> a<00:01:16.110> full<00:01:16.560> recovery<00:01:17.689> and

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
to prevent me making a full recovery and

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:19.880 
to prevent me making a full recovery and
the<00:01:18.869> second<00:01:19.200> thing<00:01:19.320> about<00:01:19.590> the<00:01:19.770> most

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
the second thing about the most

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.399 
the second thing about the most
important<00:01:20.340> thing<00:01:20.490> is<00:01:20.610> that<00:01:20.780> having<00:01:21.780> the<00:01:22.259> metal

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
important thing is that having the metal

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.350 
important thing is that having the metal
removed<00:01:22.830> gave<00:01:23.100> the<00:01:23.250> surgeon<00:01:23.640> a<00:01:23.729> chance<00:01:24.000> to<00:01:24.240> go

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
removed gave the surgeon a chance to go

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.280 
removed gave the surgeon a chance to go
in<00:01:24.509> there<00:01:24.750> and<00:01:24.869> and<00:01:25.259> trim<00:01:26.009> the<00:01:27.290> cartilage

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
in there and and trim the cartilage

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.819 
in there and and trim the cartilage
which<00:01:28.560> was<00:01:28.799> obviously<00:01:30.079> badly<00:01:31.079> ruptured<00:01:31.409> by

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
which was obviously badly ruptured by

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:35.929 
which was obviously badly ruptured by
the<00:01:31.890> tibial<00:01:32.579> plateau<00:01:32.700> fracture<00:01:34.670> so<00:01:35.670> I'm<00:01:35.790> going

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
the tibial plateau fracture so I'm going

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.300 
the tibial plateau fracture so I'm going
to<00:01:35.970> sort<00:01:36.150> of<00:01:36.210> spin<00:01:36.420> around<00:01:36.570> and<00:01:36.930> show<00:01:37.170> you<00:01:37.310> what

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
to sort of spin around and show you what

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.359 
to sort of spin around and show you what
it<00:01:38.400> looks<00:01:38.610> like<00:01:38.820> if<00:01:38.970> I<00:01:39.030> can<00:01:39.799> go<00:01:40.799> into<00:01:41.130> some

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
it looks like if I can go into some

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.760 
it looks like if I can go into some
daylight<00:01:41.759> here's<00:01:42.439> the<00:01:43.439> weather's<00:01:43.740> just

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
turned but it's still a nice light June

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.910

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
going down onto my leg oh I don't know

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.209

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
probably can't there's the the big scar

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:02.120 
probably can't there's the the big scar
from<00:01:59.909> where<00:02:00.090> they<00:02:00.180> put<00:02:00.390> it<00:02:00.420> in<00:02:00.630> and<00:02:01.290> on<00:02:01.979> this

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
from where they put it in and on this

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.389 
from where they put it in and on this
side<00:02:02.399> there<00:02:02.909> are<00:02:02.939> some<00:02:03.649> little<00:02:04.649> scars<00:02:04.950> because

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
side there are some little scars because

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.310 
side there are some little scars because
they<00:02:05.549> put<00:02:05.729> in<00:02:05.880> a<00:02:05.939> plate<00:02:06.210> on<00:02:06.509> each<00:02:06.869> side<00:02:07.140> of<00:02:07.170> the

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
they put in a plate on each side of the

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.339 
they put in a plate on each side of the
leg<00:02:07.560> when<00:02:08.250> they<00:02:08.340> put<00:02:08.520> it<00:02:08.610> in<00:02:08.700> the<00:02:08.789> first<00:02:09.060> time

00:02:09.339 --> 00:02:09.349 
leg when they put it in the first time

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:12.979 
leg when they put it in the first time
it<00:02:10.349> was<00:02:10.739> through<00:02:11.069> the<00:02:11.220> one<00:02:11.430> big<00:02:11.700> scar<00:02:12.030> but<00:02:12.840> when

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
it was through the one big scar but when

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:14.090 
it was through the one big scar but when
they<00:02:13.080> took<00:02:13.230> it<00:02:13.349> out<00:02:13.470> they<00:02:13.800> win

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100 
they took it out they win

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:18.610

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
is that my range of movement and the

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:33.080 
is that my range of movement and the
general<00:02:29.000> comfort<00:02:30.000> of<00:02:30.180> my<00:02:30.330> leg<00:02:30.600> is<00:02:31.470> still<00:02:32.430> a<00:02:32.700> lot

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
general comfort of my leg is still a lot

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.600 
general comfort of my leg is still a lot
better<00:02:33.240> than<00:02:33.570> it<00:02:33.840> was<00:02:34.040> whilst<00:02:35.040> the<00:02:35.220> medal<00:02:35.490> was

better than it was whilst the medal was
in<00:02:35.730> there<00:02:36.290> and<00:02:37.290> although<00:02:37.410> it's<00:02:37.620> not<00:02:37.710> perfect

have the metal out then frankly for the

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.530 
have the metal out then frankly for the
sake<00:03:34.710> of<00:03:34.740> the<00:03:35.100> operation<00:03:35.730> which<00:03:35.940> compared<00:03:36.420> to

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
sake of the operation which compared to

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.210

the<00:03:36.630> operation<00:03:37.110> you<00:03:37.170> have<00:03:37.290> to<00:03:37.410> put<00:03:37.560> it<00:03:37.650> in<00:03:37.800> is

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
the operation you have to put it in is

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:41.750 
the operation you have to put it in is
nothing<00:03:39.680> you<00:03:40.680> should<00:03:40.710> give<00:03:41.100> it<00:03:41.190> a<00:03:41.250> go<00:03:41.460> and<00:03:41.700> see

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
nothing you should give it a go and see

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.560 
nothing you should give it a go and see
at<00:03:42.600> the<00:03:42.690> same<00:03:42.900> time<00:03:43.140> if<00:03:43.290> your<00:03:43.760> surgeon<00:03:44.760> can<00:03:45.030> can

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:45.570 
at the same time if your surgeon can can

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:50.270 
at the same time if your surgeon can can
trim<00:03:45.930> you<00:03:46.050> up<00:03:46.230> inside<00:03:47.100> the<00:03:47.280> joint<00:03:47.490> and<00:03:49.280> make

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.280 
trim you up inside the joint and make

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.730 
trim you up inside the joint and make
the<00:03:50.780> movement<00:03:51.780> of<00:03:51.930> the<00:03:51.990> joint<00:03:52.170> a<00:03:52.410> little<00:03:52.440> bit

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:52.740 
the movement of the joint a little bit

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:55.660 
the movement of the joint a little bit
smoother<00:03:53.160> than<00:03:53.310> perhaps<00:03:53.430> it<00:03:53.670> was<00:03:53.790> beforehand

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:55.670 
smoother than perhaps it was beforehand

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:58.160 
smoother than perhaps it was beforehand
I'll<00:03:56.670> try<00:03:56.940> and<00:03:57.030> give<00:03:57.120> another<00:03:57.270> update<00:03:57.390> in<00:03:57.840> six

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:58.170 
I'll try and give another update in six

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:02.540 
I'll try and give another update in six
months<00:03:58.470> thanks<00:03:59.190> a<00:03:59.250> lot<00:03:59.400> good<00:03:59.850> luck<00:04:00.000> the<00:04:00.390> way
