00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 with this gentleman who do things and a 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.320
 once in the moment alejandro alfaro come 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:10.120
 here 

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:14.410
 I asked what is back yes and 

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:16.539
 reiterated and if it was ratified in this 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:18.369
 opinion that a participant or a 

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:20.860
 participant betrayed her in her vote 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:23.369
 that was exactly what he told this 

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:23.369
 competitor 

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:30.570
 it was if Valkyrie is left alone they have already 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:34.880
 made your brand is left alone I will go 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.880
 why would you understand why 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:41.690
 ok ok to see to see he did not tell 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:43.930
 I will support you verbatim 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:43.930
 blindly 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.399
 but if Valkyrie is left alone I do not 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:52.789
 I think she is left alone because I too 

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:54.379
 I've been through that and move with and in 

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:56.269
 tail because Valkyrie had the support of 

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:57.530
 some colleagues therefore the vote yes 

00:00:56.269 --> 00:01:00.170
 she is not alone should have gone 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:02.629
 towards your ranks but if you had in the 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:05.460
 Christian tail was flipped over and I had the 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:07.530
 opportunity to talk to that person 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:11.130
 he is not alone 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.360
 ok it is clear that it is Andalusia of the 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.010
 person we are talking about andalusia 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.479
 come here cristian come here 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.150
 because I want to know what it was that 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.650
 he said exactly you voted him of 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.880
 backs in protest because I was not 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.460
 According to what Alejandra is 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:27.920
 elimination that was what he was told he spoke 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:30.200
 with andalusia before the vote yes 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:33.590
 He said 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:35.119
 if sibal told me who is single vote 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:36.770
 for her because I do not want her to stay 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:38.030
 alone and I said it seems good to me there is no 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:41.570
 leave only nobody but I will notice 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:44.030
 by alejandra because she is alejandra 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:47.390
 that was that was what he told you ok 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:49.580
 Andalusia before making your vote is 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:52.440
 what we're going to see right now let's see 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:54.770
 the video better forward 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:58.219
 china yang any 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:02:00.670
 soto could be the decisive now let's 

00:01:58.219 --> 00:02:00.670
 China 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:19.580
 you are one, she tells me that I am very good 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:23.660
 however they did not vote for me 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:26.810
 and to you it seemed fair telecom action 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:28.550
 I sincerely believe that I have a lot 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:31.310
 more to give and I think the public what 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:34.670
 know also the pink jury works is 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.720
 that the best person who voted for me and 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:38.390
 it is not 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:41.120
 that left the tradition a little bit if 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:44.010
 I told you that I am going to vote for you and 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:46.519
 then changed 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.519
 yes 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:53.480
 it's like treason but 

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:56.600
 but what could it be or is the fact is 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:59.830
 done this is a game like it is a game 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:59.830
 so it was 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:06.319
 before making your vote I do not know if 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:08.630
 we have the video before doing 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:11.510
 placement that I have seen now you have 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:14.030
 you look aside to your right that and 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:15.590
 signs like that who do you talk to in 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:18.410
 actually I was looking at chicken 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:21.290
 because I was doing is he crying 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:24.920
 me that was not the final vote now 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:28.310
 it's good that it was clear to him that it was not such 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:32.030
 it was not literal because because I said 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:33.620
 I assumed I spoke for myself how good can 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:35.300
 to be lacking that because I did not know 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:38.450
 the decision of my friends my classmates 

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:40.970
 it was clear and I grabbed and said you know that I 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:43.550
 you see it for the day and what would it be 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:46.370
 so he does not see leaving the participation of 

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:48.860
 Valkyrie was given at that moment I am you 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:52.280
 sincere I put many letters on the table 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:54.019
 because he said Juan Luis evaluated on the 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:57.140
 path because if it is true the 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:58.340
 two n that day fell in line 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:59.980
 it's because they had at their level of 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:02.380
 deep 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:04.420
 this 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:07.420
 and I said ok then I evaluated that it was 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:08.440
 evaluate predictor and be unfair because 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:10.150
 because Alejandra has had the 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:12.580
 opportunity to be here while 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:14.620
 Valkyrie, you have not had those catches 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:15.700
 trajectory can not evaluate then 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:16.660
 then ok 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:19.540
 as we have healed at some point 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:20.950
 evaluated the day well have the day evaluate and 

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:22.090
 I thought that even though in the 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:24.580
 benefit here already went back was 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:26.020
 correct but but it's that change of 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:27.670
 opinion despite what you said 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:29.800
 alejandra previous that I will not leave alone 

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:31.450
 goes to Valkyrie in the row 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:33.430
 that was the idea with which he stayed 

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:35.340
 Alejandro Cristian and suddenly in that 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:37.810
 moment changes and plays other variables 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:40.840
 because good in the end the vote is yours and 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:42.370
 it's valid because because in go 2000 and 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:43.870
 has not changed now I do not regret it 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:45.490
 more I'm very happy with him I wanted to have 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:48.160
 the opportunity to shine because all 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:49.480
 we knew that I could give this but if my 

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:51.400
 friends are not going to allow my 

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:53.590
 classmates knew very well and voting in 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:55.270
 bases for Valkyrie if he was not going to 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:57.520
 to be the same as he did 

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:59.260
 last season that I was projecting 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:01.630
 that he would be by his side of all 

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:03.820
 ways he said that if not the support 

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:05.710
 because there was no good and suspension my 

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:07.630
 superstition and gave me one more reason to 

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:09.460
 ok he was right to make his vote 

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:10.630
 perfect is your decision and that is 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:12.400
 respect that to close the topic 

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:14.230
 Christian nothing that clear that there is no 

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:16.480
 no position of influence of votes 

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:18.520
 that they agree that nothing and 

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:21.040
 I find valid you will think and vote 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:22.450
 to stop here and that in your head you 

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:24.250
 I'll pass you by voting for beige votes 

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:28.800
 see that's fine is worth the vote is 

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:28.800
 yours what is not valid is to say 

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:33.130
 and to make see decided such with this is 

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:34.880
 all this this and in the end see you 

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:36.320
 contradicting there because in the end the 

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:37.610
 vote is decided by a person who can 

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:39.500
 another one outside and the moment changes 

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:42.100
 opinion and is also valid but not 

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:42.100
 supported 

00:05:42.849 --> 00:05:47.300
 even though 

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:49.310
 I honestly know that I did it wrong but 

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:51.410
 if I really think that I should not have fat 

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:52.910
 row and the worst thing is that I knew that in 

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:54.590
 any time that row arrived 

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:56.840
 I was going to go because yesterday I checked 

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:59.270
 that there are groups and I have 

00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:01.550
 checked and the people too and the people 

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:03.830
 it also says it and the saddest thing for me 

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:05.690
 is that whatever happens and say what 

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:07.650
 Say, it's not going to change because I 'm not going to 

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:10.979
 return more 

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:12.840
 ok this time is the subject thank you guys what 

00:06:10.979 --> 00:06:15.720
 that has to go to the repechage thanks to 

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:17.910
 depor is with us is like this gentlemen 

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:21.870
 decisions sometimes generate controversy 

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:24.030
 but each participant is responsible for 

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:26.310
 your decision and you have to take charge and 

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:30.620
 face the dimes and diretes of the people 

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:30.620
 in favor is not so the competition
