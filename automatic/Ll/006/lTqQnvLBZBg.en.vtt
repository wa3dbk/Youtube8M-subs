00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.320 
for our overhead squad assessment from
the<00:00:07.529> anterior<00:00:08.190> view<00:00:08.430> we're<00:00:08.790> going<00:00:08.820> to<00:00:09.059> begin

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
the anterior view we're going to begin

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.420 
the anterior view we're going to begin
by<00:00:09.510> looking<00:00:09.540> at<00:00:09.930> the<00:00:09.990> feet<00:00:10.320> when<00:00:10.770> one<00:00:10.980> squats

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:11.430 
by looking at the feet when one squats

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:13.279 
by looking at the feet when one squats
their<00:00:11.700> feet<00:00:11.910> should<00:00:12.180> be<00:00:12.240> able<00:00:12.420> to<00:00:12.600> stay<00:00:12.900> nice

00:00:13.279 --> 00:00:13.289 
their feet should be able to stay nice

00:00:13.289 --> 00:00:15.470 
their feet should be able to stay nice
and<00:00:13.350> straight<00:00:13.860> the<00:00:14.070> common<00:00:14.850> compensation

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
and straight the common compensation

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.689 
and straight the common compensation
that<00:00:15.570> we<00:00:15.629> see<00:00:15.930> is<00:00:16.080> the<00:00:16.260> feet<00:00:16.500> turning<00:00:16.980> out<00:00:17.130> so

squat three to five times about to the
height<00:00:36.870> of<00:00:37.050> a<00:00:37.110> normal<00:00:37.260> chair<00:00:37.680> what<00:00:38.460> we<00:00:38.610> can<00:00:38.760> see

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
height of a normal chair what we can see

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:40.700 
height of a normal chair what we can see
there<00:00:39.000> immediately<00:00:39.629> is<00:00:39.750> that<00:00:39.780> her<00:00:40.050> feet<00:00:40.350> start

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
there immediately is that her feet start

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.430 
there immediately is that her feet start
to<00:00:40.770> turn<00:00:41.070> out<00:00:41.600> last<00:00:42.600> year<00:00:42.840> just<00:00:43.020> to<00:00:43.109> do<00:00:43.230> one

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
to turn out last year just to do one

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.830 
to turn out last year just to do one
more<00:00:43.590> and<00:00:43.850> you<00:00:44.850> can<00:00:45.000> go<00:00:45.120> ahead<00:00:45.180> and<00:00:45.359> relax<00:00:45.539> if

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
more and you can go ahead and relax if

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.080 
more and you can go ahead and relax if
we<00:00:46.079> can<00:00:46.260> see<00:00:46.469> the<00:00:46.590> compensation<00:00:47.309> there's<00:00:47.820> no

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
we can see the compensation there's no

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.450 
we can see the compensation there's no
reason<00:00:48.600> to<00:00:48.750> continue<00:00:49.170> making<00:00:49.859> her<00:00:49.980> squatting

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
reason to continue making her squatting

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.490 
reason to continue making her squatting
we<00:00:50.789> see<00:00:51.090> or<00:00:51.239> do<00:00:51.359> it<00:00:51.510> and<00:00:51.690> then<00:00:52.079> we'll<00:00:52.199> just<00:00:52.320> move

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
we see or do it and then we'll just move

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.470 
we see or do it and then we'll just move
on<00:00:52.649> from<00:00:52.680> there<00:00:53.070> now<00:00:53.640> the<00:00:53.699> muscles<00:00:54.210> that<00:00:54.329> are

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
on from there now the muscles that are

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.509 
on from there now the muscles that are
overactive<00:00:55.289> whenever<00:00:55.710> the<00:00:55.829> feet<00:00:56.039> turn<00:00:56.340> out

00:00:56.509 --> 00:00:56.519 
overactive whenever the feet turn out

00:00:56.519 --> 00:00:59.660 
overactive whenever the feet turn out
are<00:00:56.760> the<00:00:57.300> lateral<00:00:57.629> gastrocnemius<00:00:58.280> the<00:00:59.280> short

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
are the lateral gastrocnemius the short

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.079 
are the lateral gastrocnemius the short
head<00:00:59.850> of<00:00:59.879> the<00:01:00.000> biceps<00:01:00.090> femoris<00:01:00.780> and<00:01:01.370> the<00:01:02.370> TfL

head of the biceps femoris and the TfL

00:01:03.089 --> 00:01:04.820 
head of the biceps femoris and the TfL
now<00:01:03.539> let's<00:01:03.719> identify<00:01:03.899> those<00:01:04.260> muscles<00:01:04.710> if<00:01:04.800> you

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
now let's identify those muscles if you

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.920 
now let's identify those muscles if you
wouldn't<00:01:05.129> mind<00:01:05.280> turning<00:01:05.519> around<00:01:05.760> for<00:01:06.000> me<00:01:06.210> so

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
wouldn't mind turning around for me so

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.690 
wouldn't mind turning around for me so
whenever<00:01:07.110> we<00:01:07.440> look<00:01:07.620> at<00:01:07.770> the<00:01:07.890> overactive

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
whenever we look at the overactive

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:09.440 
whenever we look at the overactive
muscles<00:01:08.910> here

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
muscles here

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.200 
muscles here
when<00:01:09.810> the<00:01:09.930> feet<00:01:10.110> turn<00:01:10.350> out<00:01:10.610> the<00:01:11.610> overactive

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
when the feet turn out the overactive

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.400 
when the feet turn out the overactive
muscles<00:01:12.300> are<00:01:12.600> the<00:01:12.690> muscles<00:01:12.960> which<00:01:13.110> are<00:01:13.230> doing

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:13.410 
muscles are the muscles which are doing

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:15.080 
muscles are the muscles which are doing
too<00:01:13.680> much<00:01:13.860> can<00:01:14.130> be<00:01:14.160> identified<00:01:14.640> as<00:01:14.850> the

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
too much can be identified as the

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.420 
too much can be identified as the
lateral<00:01:15.420> gastrocnemius<00:01:15.960> now<00:01:16.890> the<00:01:16.950> lateral

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
lateral gastrocnemius now the lateral

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.490 
lateral gastrocnemius now the lateral
gastroc<00:01:17.820> is<00:01:17.970> positioned<00:01:18.450> here<00:01:18.630> we<00:01:18.960> have<00:01:19.170> the

gastroc is positioned here we have the

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.890 
gastroc is positioned here we have the
lateral<00:01:19.950> and<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:20.160> medial<00:01:20.790> head<00:01:21.150> when<00:01:21.690> we<00:01:21.780> look

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
lateral and the medial head when we look

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.230 
lateral and the medial head when we look
at<00:01:21.960> the<00:01:22.050> gastrocnemius<00:01:22.440> it<00:01:22.950> crosses<00:01:23.760> both<00:01:23.970> the

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
at the gastrocnemius it crosses both the

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.870 
at the gastrocnemius it crosses both the
ankle<00:01:24.660> and<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:25.530> knee<00:01:25.560> and<00:01:26.010> whenever<00:01:26.490> the<00:01:26.700> knee

is slightly bent so go ahead and come
into<00:01:28.380> a<00:01:28.470> small<00:01:28.650> squat<00:01:29.190> there<00:01:29.430> what<00:01:30.030> we<00:01:30.180> see<00:01:30.450> is

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
into a small squat there what we see is

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.900 
into a small squat there what we see is
that<00:01:30.630> lateral<00:01:31.320> gastrocnemius<00:01:31.920> can<00:01:32.520> help<00:01:32.730> to

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:32.910 
that lateral gastrocnemius can help to

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:35.840 
that lateral gastrocnemius can help to
externally<00:01:33.870> rotate<00:01:34.380> the<00:01:34.650> tibia<00:01:35.190> which<00:01:35.670> is

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
externally rotate the tibia which is

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.510 
externally rotate the tibia which is
turning<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:36.300> feet<00:01:36.480> out<00:01:36.510> in<00:01:36.980> addition<00:01:37.980> we<00:01:38.370> have

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
turning the feet out in addition we have

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.130 
turning the feet out in addition we have
this<00:01:38.670> short<00:01:39.000> head<00:01:39.120> of<00:01:39.150> the<00:01:39.300> biceps<00:01:39.390> femoris

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
this short head of the biceps femoris

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.920 
this short head of the biceps femoris
which<00:01:40.590> is<00:01:40.740> positioned<00:01:41.250> here<00:01:41.460> it<00:01:41.970> attaches<00:01:42.600> out

which is positioned here it attaches out

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.590 
which is positioned here it attaches out
to<00:01:43.140> the<00:01:43.260> fibular<00:01:43.680> head<00:01:43.710> and<00:01:44.130> comes<00:01:45.090> up<00:01:45.330> about<00:01:45.540> a

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
to the fibular head and comes up about a

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.720 
to the fibular head and comes up about a

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:47.730 
third of the way up the thigh and again

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:49.880 
third of the way up the thigh and again
as<00:01:47.940> we<00:01:48.420> go<00:01:48.540> into<00:01:48.750> the<00:01:49.050> squat<00:01:49.380> if<00:01:49.620> it's

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
as we go into the squat if it's

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.230 
as we go into the squat if it's
overactive<00:01:50.670> it<00:01:50.910> can<00:01:51.360> turn<00:01:51.780> the<00:01:52.410> foot<00:01:52.680> out<00:01:52.890> and

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:53.240 
overactive it can turn the foot out and

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.610 
overactive it can turn the foot out and
go<00:01:54.240> ahead<00:01:54.450> and<00:01:54.570> stand<00:01:54.840> and<00:01:55.110> if<00:01:55.170> we<00:01:55.260> could<00:01:55.410> turn

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:55.620 
go ahead and stand and if we could turn

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:57.230 
go ahead and stand and if we could turn
and<00:01:55.860> face<00:01:56.010> back<00:01:56.250> towards<00:01:56.610> the<00:01:56.730> camera<00:01:57.090> in

addition<00:01:58.340> one<00:01:59.340> that's<00:01:59.550> oftentimes<00:02:00.000> left<00:02:00.540> out

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:00.720 
addition one that's oftentimes left out

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.950 
addition one that's oftentimes left out
is<00:02:00.960> the<00:02:01.440> TfL<00:02:02.010> now<00:02:02.550> the<00:02:02.610> TfL<00:02:03.090> sets<00:02:03.360> up<00:02:03.540> here<00:02:03.720> near

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
is the TfL now the TfL sets up here near

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.930 
is the TfL now the TfL sets up here near
the<00:02:04.110> hip<00:02:04.380> but<00:02:04.920> what<00:02:05.070> we<00:02:05.160> need<00:02:05.340> to<00:02:05.430> understand

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:05.940 
the hip but what we need to understand

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.240 
the hip but what we need to understand
is<00:02:06.180> that<00:02:06.420> it<00:02:06.720> attaches<00:02:07.050> to<00:02:07.320> the<00:02:07.410> IT<00:02:07.560> band<00:02:08.009> and

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
is that it attaches to the IT band and

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.550 
is that it attaches to the IT band and
that<00:02:08.759> IT<00:02:08.910> band<00:02:09.119> comes<00:02:09.569> all<00:02:09.840> the<00:02:10.080> way<00:02:10.110> down<00:02:10.200> here

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
that IT band comes all the way down here

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.170 
that IT band comes all the way down here
and<00:02:10.619> attaches<00:02:11.099> to<00:02:11.220> the<00:02:11.340> front<00:02:11.610> part<00:02:11.970> of<00:02:12.030> the

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
and attaches to the front part of the

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.509 
and attaches to the front part of the
tibia<00:02:12.420> so<00:02:13.290> if<00:02:13.469> any<00:02:13.680> of<00:02:13.859> those<00:02:14.010> muscles<00:02:14.400> are

00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:14.519 
tibia so if any of those muscles are

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:16.459 
tibia so if any of those muscles are
overactive<00:02:15.239> which<00:02:15.659> simply<00:02:16.019> means<00:02:16.049> they're

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:16.469 
overactive which simply means they're

00:02:16.469 --> 00:02:18.380 
overactive which simply means they're
doing<00:02:16.829> more<00:02:17.099> than<00:02:17.310> they<00:02:17.489> should

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
doing more than they should

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.690 
doing more than they should
whenever<00:02:18.810> we<00:02:19.050> squat<00:02:19.530> it<00:02:19.800> will<00:02:20.010> start<00:02:20.280> to<00:02:20.430> turn

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
whenever we squat it will start to turn

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.030 
whenever we squat it will start to turn
the<00:02:20.910> feet<00:02:21.120> out<00:02:21.170> now<00:02:22.170> the<00:02:22.230> under<00:02:22.710> active

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
the feet out now the under active

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.890 
the feet out now the under active
muscles<00:02:23.430> the<00:02:23.910> muscles<00:02:24.060> that<00:02:24.390> are<00:02:24.450> normally

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
muscles the muscles that are normally

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.170 
muscles the muscles that are normally
not<00:02:25.140> doing<00:02:25.500> their<00:02:25.620> job<00:02:25.890> are<00:02:26.100> usually<00:02:26.850> just<00:02:26.880> on

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
not doing their job are usually just on

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.270 
not doing their job are usually just on
the<00:02:27.270> other<00:02:27.450> side<00:02:27.840> of<00:02:27.990> this<00:02:28.080> joint<00:02:28.350> so<00:02:29.010> with

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
the other side of this joint so with

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:30.380 
the other side of this joint so with
that<00:02:29.430> we<00:02:29.580> would<00:02:29.700> see<00:02:29.880> the<00:02:30.000> medial

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
that we would see the medial

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.000 
that we would see the medial
gastrocnemius<00:02:30.840> you<00:02:31.500> could<00:02:31.650> go<00:02:31.740> ahead<00:02:31.890> and

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
gastrocnemius you could go ahead and

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.640 
gastrocnemius you could go ahead and
spin<00:02:32.250> around<00:02:32.340> for<00:02:32.730> me<00:02:32.820> again<00:02:33.200> the<00:02:34.200> medial

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
spin around for me again the medial

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.410 
spin around for me again the medial
gastrocnemius<00:02:35.100> is<00:02:35.550> going<00:02:35.820> to<00:02:35.910> be<00:02:36.000> here<00:02:36.210> on<00:02:36.330> the

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
gastrocnemius is going to be here on the

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.470 
gastrocnemius is going to be here on the
inside<00:02:37.130> so<00:02:38.130> it's<00:02:38.310> the<00:02:38.460> other<00:02:38.700> side<00:02:39.180> of<00:02:39.330> the

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
inside so it's the other side of the

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.650 
inside so it's the other side of the
joint<00:02:39.780> in<00:02:40.110> the<00:02:40.770> transverse<00:02:41.430> plane<00:02:41.700> transverse

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
joint in the transverse plane transverse

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:44.930 
joint in the transverse plane transverse
plane<00:02:42.960> with<00:02:43.080> the<00:02:43.140> knee<00:02:43.320> rotation<00:02:43.950> we<00:02:44.550> can<00:02:44.580> also

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
plane with the knee rotation we can also

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:46.760 
plane with the knee rotation we can also
see<00:02:45.270> the<00:02:45.420> medial<00:02:45.840> side<00:02:46.050> of<00:02:46.110> the<00:02:46.230> hamstring

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.770 
see the medial side of the hamstring

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:50.060 
see the medial side of the hamstring
becoming<00:02:47.190> under<00:02:47.370> active<00:02:47.730> and<00:02:48.560> the<00:02:49.560> glutes<00:02:49.860> can

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.070 
becoming under active and the glutes can

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:51.320 
becoming under active and the glutes can
also<00:02:50.220> become<00:02:50.610> under<00:02:50.820> active<00:02:51.060> you<00:02:51.150> can<00:02:51.270> go

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
also become under active you can go

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.360 
also become under active you can go
ahead<00:02:51.390> and<00:02:51.570> spin<00:02:51.780> around<00:02:51.810> again<00:02:52.190> so<00:02:53.190> whenever

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
ahead and spin around again so whenever

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.550 
ahead and spin around again so whenever
we<00:02:53.550> see<00:02:53.790> the<00:02:53.910> feet<00:02:54.090> turn<00:02:54.300> out<00:02:54.480> the<00:02:54.990> areas<00:02:55.410> we

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
we see the feet turn out the areas we

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:56.750 
we see the feet turn out the areas we
would<00:02:55.680> need<00:02:55.860> to<00:02:55.920> foam<00:02:56.160> roll<00:02:56.190> and<00:02:56.550> stretch

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
would need to foam roll and stretch

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.390 
would need to foam roll and stretch
would<00:02:57.150> be<00:02:57.240> the<00:02:57.390> lateral<00:02:57.720> gastroc<00:02:58.200> this<00:02:59.100> short

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
would be the lateral gastroc this short

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.600 
would be the lateral gastroc this short
head<00:02:59.520> of<00:02:59.550> the<00:02:59.640> biceps<00:02:59.730> force<00:03:00.330> and<00:03:00.600> the<00:03:01.500> TfL<00:03:02.010> the
