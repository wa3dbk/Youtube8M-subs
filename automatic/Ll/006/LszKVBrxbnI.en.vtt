00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
you can go faster and you hit the brake

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.040 
you can go faster and you hit the brake
make<00:03:06.640> a<00:03:06.700> couple<00:03:06.910> of<00:03:07.060> sharp<00:03:07.330> turns<00:03:07.630> you'll<00:03:07.840> slow

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:08.050 
make a couple of sharp turns you'll slow

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:10.620 
make a couple of sharp turns you'll slow
down<00:03:08.230> real<00:03:08.680> quick<00:03:09.150> maybe<00:03:10.150> run<00:03:10.360> into<00:03:10.540> the

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:10.630 
down real quick maybe run into the

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:12.150 
down real quick maybe run into the
ground<00:03:10.810> a<00:03:10.900> few<00:03:10.930> times<00:03:11.230> run<00:03:11.560> into<00:03:11.800> something<00:03:11.980> to

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:12.160 
ground a few times run into something to

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.130 
ground a few times run into something to
slow<00:03:12.310> you<00:03:12.400> down<00:03:12.690> and<00:03:13.690> you'll<00:03:13.840> just<00:03:13.930> start

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.140 
slow you down and you'll just start

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:25.230 
slow you down and you'll just start
floating<00:03:20.880> then<00:03:23.370> you're<00:03:24.370> flying<00:03:24.700> car<00:03:24.970> again

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:25.240 
floating then you're flying car again

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:29.930 
floating then you're flying car again
just<00:03:25.660> by<00:03:25.780> hitting<00:03:25.900> the<00:03:26.110> gas<00:03:26.290> and<00:03:26.500> driving<00:03:26.800> away

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:33.420 

it's<00:03:30.940> neat<00:03:31.150> trick
