leafy<00:02:39.000> earth<00:02:39.150> salad<00:02:39.630> I<00:02:39.750> wouldn't<00:02:40.049> put<00:02:40.230> as<00:02:40.410> much

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680

of the mayonnaise but in this case this

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.780 
of the mayonnaise but in this case this
is<00:02:48.480> a<00:02:48.660> pretty<00:02:48.930> shallow<00:02:49.200> bowl<00:02:49.620> so<00:02:50.040> tossing<00:02:50.670> it

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
is a pretty shallow bowl so tossing it

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:52.640 
is a pretty shallow bowl so tossing it
is<00:02:50.910> not<00:02:51.120> really<00:02:51.630> that<00:02:51.660> big<00:02:51.840> of<00:02:52.109> an<00:02:52.200> option

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
is not really that big of an option

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.340 
is not really that big of an option
