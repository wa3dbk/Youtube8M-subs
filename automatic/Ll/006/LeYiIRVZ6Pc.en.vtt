and<00:00:34.350> for<00:00:35.070> the<00:00:35.190> first<00:00:35.460> time<00:00:35.730> ever<00:00:36.030> we've

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
and for the first time ever we've

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.130 
and for the first time ever we've
increased<00:00:37.410> the<00:00:37.559> size<00:00:37.649> of<00:00:38.010> the<00:00:38.070> display<00:00:39.140> by

to<00:00:57.470> achieve<00:00:57.590> a<00:00:57.830> design<00:00:58.250> this<00:00:58.550> thing<00:00:58.610> we<00:00:59.570> had<00:00:59.720> to

00:00:59.740 --> 00:00:59.750 
to achieve a design this thing we had to

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:01.150 
to achieve a design this thing we had to
look<00:00:59.960> at<00:01:00.140> making<00:01:00.350> many<00:01:00.800> of<00:01:00.890> the<00:01:01.130> components

very carefully we've created the new
much<00:01:53.000> smaller<00:01:53.390> lightning<00:01:54.080> connector<00:01:54.380> it's

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:55.070 
much smaller lightning connector it's

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:57.219 
much smaller lightning connector it's
all<00:01:55.310> digital<00:01:55.550> so<00:01:56.210> it's<00:01:56.450> designed<00:01:56.869> for<00:01:57.020> today's

00:01:57.219 --> 00:01:57.229 
all digital so it's designed for today's

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:00.310 
all digital so it's designed for today's
uses<00:01:57.710> and<00:01:58.160> we<00:01:58.850> made<00:01:59.060> it<00:01:59.090> reversible<00:01:59.810> so<00:02:00.170> it

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:00.320 
uses and we made it reversible so it

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.430 
uses and we made it reversible so it
fits<00:02:00.590> either<00:02:00.830> way<00:02:01.600> we<00:02:02.600> also<00:02:02.780> moved<00:02:03.229> to<00:02:03.350> a

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:03.440 
fits either way we also moved to a

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:06.370 
fits either way we also moved to a

sapphire lens cover which is thinner and
more<00:02:06.799> durable<00:02:07.340> than<00:02:07.610> the<00:02:07.820> previous<00:02:08.330> cover

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:08.570 
more durable than the previous cover

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:10.810 
more durable than the previous cover
glass<00:02:08.840> this<00:02:09.500> really<00:02:10.010> protects<00:02:10.429> the<00:02:10.640> optics

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:10.820
