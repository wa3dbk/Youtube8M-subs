00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:12.549
 hi girls here we are with a new one 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:14.769
 video 

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:21.340
 today I want to present you a bracelet 

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:24.369
 using the flat wrinkle for the 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:28.140
 we need our bracelet 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:31.210
 pack of flat silver rubber 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:35.100
 a pack of reginato was flying 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:40.299
 metallic purple a magnetic closure 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:45.129
 about millimeters as tools 

00:00:40.299 --> 00:00:48.159
 of the nippers or the superfluous glue the 

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:52.470
 Our first glue them to apply 

00:00:48.159 --> 00:00:56.110
 the outfits and then to have them as types e 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:01:04.119
 for example, I chose hotfix colors 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:09.659
 the crystal landis the pizza pink and 

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:09.659
 those in gray and white pearls 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:19.450
 then after cutting three strips of 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:22.420
 flat rubber this to the 6 mm 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:24.789
 we are going to glue it inside 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:26.890
 of the slot of the closure with the 

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:30.460
 super blue of course every strip 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:34.500
 must be of the necessary size 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:34.500
 in the right size for your wrist 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:48.159
 then let's put a lot of glue on it 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:57.550
 We send down in it 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:02:03.190
 let's put some on the wire too 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:07.289
 and we begin to glue wait for a 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:07.289
 let's go on with the other two 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:14.620
 once pasted our theses 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:18.130
 trim strips we go to sign of 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:24.330
 paste the wire mesh then 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:24.330
 put some glue on the trezzini 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:46.750
 we inform you turn around so 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:46.750
 define it a little 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:03:07.340
 and wait a while for the woman in short 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:09.430
 attacks made this start to decorate 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:13.720
 my bracelet is the reason 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:16.459
 of the decoration I thought then 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:18.739
 few words we have to alternate the 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:22.790
 tubular retina once doing it 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:27.580
 pass over the thread then below and then 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:27.580
 making it come out again 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:40.580
 then down above 20 off during the 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:47.470
 processing 

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:52.569
 if you twist a little we can fix it 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:52.569
 thus forming small squares 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:13.409
 and we continue until the end when 

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:15.120
 we have finished decorating everything 

00:04:13.409 --> 00:04:17.250
 the length with the metallic net 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:19.320
 let's redo the same steps 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:21.959
 we performed at the beginning for 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:24.300
 then glue the wires to the closure 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:27.720
 that we put laboring we wrap the 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:31.070
 retina and then incur children 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:31.070
 within the measure 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:42.340
 then once finished building the 

00:04:40.509 --> 00:04:44.889
 our embraces we are going to apply 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:48.279
 all the oxxxas vexing the various colors 

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:50.979
 then by way of stones 16 we use the 

00:04:48.279 --> 00:04:54.039
 4 mm tip and then change it with 

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:57.719
 the 3 mm one for the parts the outfits 

00:04:54.039 --> 00:04:57.719
 10 ss 

00:04:59.289 --> 00:05:07.389
 let's fill in each square 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:11.169
 formed by the tubular retina with jobs 

00:05:07.389 --> 00:05:13.589
 higgs and mixing to taste nor all 

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:13.589
 colors 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:28.419
 here's our embrace everything 

00:05:24.249 --> 00:05:30.669
 decorated with optics as you can 

00:05:28.419 --> 00:05:33.180
 see a very simple drawing for 

00:05:30.669 --> 00:05:36.180
 anzio matera of light effects 

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:36.180
 beautiful 

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:44.439
 instead if you want to use simple 

00:05:42.189 --> 00:05:46.409
 in your creations, flat rubber 

00:05:44.439 --> 00:05:48.550
 but you want a lot more design 

00:05:46.409 --> 00:05:51.520
 simple even faster than 

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:53.469
 achieve to achieve you can 

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:57.039
 use net group you find 

00:05:53.469 --> 00:06:00.330
