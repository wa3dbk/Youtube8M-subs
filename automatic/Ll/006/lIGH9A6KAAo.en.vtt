00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:08.700
 [Music] 

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:08.700
 [Applause] 

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:12.650
 hello that such then because if very well 

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:16.190
 it's a video we're going to see an excellent top 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:18.290
 of difficult or impossible games these 

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:20.330
 games is mostly that they are 

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:22.820
 pretty easy in terms of design 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:24.529
 quite simple but they are very addictive 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:26.930
 very good that we're going to see a 27 that 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:28.730
 sure you will love them good in 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:30.080
 this time we started from the seventh 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:31.820
 or until the first one after we started 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:33.530
 as intangible we have seen no 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:36.520
 case was also very easy then 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:38.950
 well, we just have to press 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:41.350
 and we have to avoid hitting ourselves with the 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:42.910
 obstacles or with the skewers and avoid 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:45.430
 falling each level is becoming a 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:47.680
 a little more complicated, more difficult is a 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:49.810
 very addictive game also a game 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:52.390
 pretty simple but it's pretty 

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:54.790
 great with the graphic support are quite 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:56.620
 good news hy is very good 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:58.030
 so I hope you like it and I hope 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:59.970
 that we propose to enjoy each level 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:02.140
 they are so no more complicated and more difficult 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:03.940
 it's this place we have a game called 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:06.280
 expand in your game that simply 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:07.630
 it's about the following it's all going very 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:10.470
 well we are enlarging what is the 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:13.180
 kite and we have to go picking up those 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.520
 is the stars then the part 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:17.140
 red on the lower part and the blue part on the 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.479
 part of top then we have to go 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:21.970
 for example to install sun then 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:24.580
 we have to go down we go taking 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:27.369
 here with the objectives for example let's 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:29.440
 to catch without touching us when the 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:31.180
 red color that is on the ground floor and 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:33.310
 the blue color of the river plant there 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:35.410
 ground floor we see that an obstacle in the 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:37.630
 blue plant to the little ones so that 

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:38.920
 can we give it here and now we can not enlarge 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.080
 we have to go up so that it becomes 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.950
 blue is on the top floor we put 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:45.049
 the obstacles above 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.810
 and then it is going to complicate the truth cc 

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:49.670
 well very elegant in fifth place 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.439
 we have lame that is called team runner is 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.670
 a pretty easy game that deals with what 

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:54.409
 next we have the levels let's go 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.539
 to choose we have two bars 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:59.000
 then nothing we are going to press the button 

00:01:56.539 --> 00:02:00.649
 cash we press then the bars 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.479
 we have removing the obstacles not 

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:04.369
 we go up and down we have to have in 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:06.170
 note that they are playing as two games 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:07.369
 at the same time the bar below also has 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:09.470
 these levels and we can not let that 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:11.420
 no chop 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:13.430
 for example there I stayed then 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.410
 how did the top bar stay 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:17.540
 down bar was also removed not 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:18.740
 we can let it stay none has 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:22.360
 rented at the same time how to overcome 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:22.360
 as they can see and stick 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:33.230
 but in court what we have from the 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:34.430
 tubing remains as with the accelerometer 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:36.469
 of the telephone 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:37.790
 there we put it here to take this 

00:02:36.469 --> 00:02:42.909
 type of plane cited and we have to go 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:42.909
 dodging up and our field 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:48.980
 and the truth is quite elegant because 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:51.440
 pretty fast and we have to then the 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:53.150
 series of pretty good little ones 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.319
 it helped to also appreciate there well but 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.680
 download what sure is going 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:56.680
 love 

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:04.800
 [Music] 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.330
 because we are basically in a world 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:08.490
 like the edifice metric songs and we're going 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:10.500
 here if we press on both sides we 

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:12.180
 let's go left recharged 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.730
 the energy if we press both sides 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:17.040
 enough time let's go to and we're going to 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:19.830
 jump more and more for example more to 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:23.430
 here to avoid it if I want to go 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:27.140
 and I jump a lot if we get more press 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:30.480
 more will be the long jump and 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:33.680
 it can be quite energy and that 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:33.680
 let's get the highest possible points 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:44.040
 in second place we have the impossible 

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:46.500
 I steal a pretty elegant game that 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:49.409
 what we are going to do is direct this 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:50.610
 roll down this pretty fast downhill and 

00:03:49.409 --> 00:03:52.500
 without letting us fall if we want 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:55.730
 for example and we fall near the next 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.730
 place then we keep playing 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:08.489
 as the first line that is the one 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:10.049
 then to break there I have the 3 and is 

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:12.000
 Pretty elegant and very nice block 

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:14.120
 pretty fast at the beginning it costs 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.680
 pretty but the thing is pretty cool 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:18.060
 a very addictive game and also quite 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:20.930
 entertained and that I also hope that what 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:20.930
 can enjoy you 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:30.140
 good and first of all we have already 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:31.310
 we have the game of a possible game very 

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:32.540
 elegant that we have little in a 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:33.920
 video a new game 

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:36.860
 here we have to select the level 

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:38.450
 dail is simple very simple simple and of 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:39.500
 future and good pretty strong here 

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:41.210
 we have other levels that I am 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:43.550
 blocked we make the highest score and 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:45.350
 well let's play from there simple what 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:47.570
 I put here to see how we have 

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:51.170
 to go through this for this type of neighborhood 

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:52.670
 of energy bar and is to avoid what 

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:55.970
 which are all the bars and all the 

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:57.500
 statutes let's put it here in the 

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:59.650
 more complicated level so that they can 

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:59.650
 watch 

00:05:00.969 --> 00:05:04.599
 he was also very active game 

00:05:02.769 --> 00:05:07.269
 practically impossible how elegant 

00:05:04.599 --> 00:05:11.050
 There comes a time when it is already so 

00:05:07.269 --> 00:05:12.729
 speed that you can not get practically 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:15.479
 and then the goal is to get the most 

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:15.479
 possible score 

00:05:20.599 --> 00:05:25.210
 Y 

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:25.210
 to 

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:31.930
 Y 

00:05:30.009 --> 00:05:34.569
 so then I hope that there is 

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:35.589
 liked this top of 7 games so no 

00:05:34.569 --> 00:05:37.210
 forget we give away in law and has 

00:05:35.589 --> 00:05:39.689
 liked let's go other upcoming videos and 

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:39.689
 I hope it is
