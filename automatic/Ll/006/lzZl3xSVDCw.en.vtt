00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
 because youtube viewers will be today 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.089
 share with you a wonderful recipe 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:08.490
 mask layer for our hair 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:11.010
 it is not one way very helpful and what 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:20.160
 exactly you will find out after watching this 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:22.859
 video and as you already understood about today 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.260
 programs and so what is so useful 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.029
 I need to say that I have the lineup 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.859
 tannins and as you understand 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.080
 here is the key root oak 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.329
 if you draw an analogy with him you can 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.030
 understand how to impact on the night of hair 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:38.040
 I think it's not a secret for you that ours 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.170
 hair consists of small scales and they 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.600
 you are forever exposed to them 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.399
 our case on the contrary returns 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.190
 them in place and two trunks becomes 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.960
 very smooth and also besides that she 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.969
 imbibe it from the inside out 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.340
 substances and with time our hair 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.239
 grow will be beat shut up very and 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.300
 very thick 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:59.370
 our hair does not work very well and 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.780
 on the skin of our heads so how if 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.879
 for example you have a few here 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.549
 decomposition it can easily 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:07.439
 take off but exposure to points to 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.900
 the place which is between the skin 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:12.360
 our heads and hair or rather on his 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.820
 root with time it strengthens was 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.280
 so much so that the hair just stops 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.540
 drop out and come directly to 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.759
 very recipe masks 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.970
 how can it be her main component 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:25.140
 is henna but what 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:25.890
 colorless natural since we 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.350
 occupy 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:31.140
 not by staining but by strengthening our 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.630
 hair and the second ingredient is shampoo 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.400
 take the one that you like which 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.440
 will not conflict with your skin 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.479
 heads since there we were able to withstand 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:41.460
 certain time this mask and take 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.800
 also the fruit that you do not mind because 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.250
 that it may take quite 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:47.340
 lot 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:49.320
 my head is enough for bags of these her 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.479
 and also add shampoos to someone in 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.210
 able to make my mask 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:57.690
 full thick consistency and mix everything 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:59.759
 ingredients we go to the shower before 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:02.670
 than put our mask we first 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:05.580
 We wash our hair with a simple flowing 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.800
 water after this when our hair is still 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:10.920
 did not have time to dry, we put this mask 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:12.930
 throughout our scalp special 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.540
 attention as you understand it we pay 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:18.269
 root zone if you suddenly become 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.620
 your mask then i advise you or not 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:21.840
 postpone the next time a 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:24.090
 spread along the length of your hair 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:27.090
 yes of course on such and so 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:30.030
 effective but still it is not a limit to 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.500
 to the fact that your mask will deteriorate so 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.570
 form of space for minutes 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:36.300
 inside at this time doing all that 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:37.620
 please after that also we just 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:40.620
 remove our mask 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:42.570
 water and from after this mask by 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:45.270
 the standard can be brought seems not 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:48.060
 his balm is another chemical moscow but 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:51.360
 i prefer not to do i look like 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:54.600
 chip oil for example exr binary from 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.930
 Loreal his elixir like you at the hands of 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.540
 this 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.670
 choosing some one of them i put 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:02.190
 the final point in this wonderful 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:04.950
 procedure because after henna was 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:07.110
 case bridges and very voluminous oil 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:09.420
 just to clear it is not shine 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:12.060
 clean up some unnecessary fluffy and 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:14.580
 also use only this mask 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:16.530
 and butter I achieve the effect that 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:18.870
 hair will remain clean. 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:21.750
 you're even on day 4 and nod think about 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:22.290
 Tom and should I say the final 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.750
 hell 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:26.730
 after first using this mask 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:28.580
 you will notice how your hair has become more 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:32.040
 thick bulky 

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:34.220
 also after two weeks you will notice that 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:36.930
 just running your hand through your hair 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:39.660
 they will practically stop 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:42.330
 fall out and even eat when washing your 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:43.319
 head and a month later you will notice how 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:46.140
 your voice 

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:48.090
 and your scalp will improve drawing 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:49.560
 not even these three factors I will you 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:52.019
 should try this 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:54.150
 mask because firstly she is 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:55.799
 very budget and brass she is 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:58.950
 very act tank result 

00:03:55.799 --> 00:04:01.170
