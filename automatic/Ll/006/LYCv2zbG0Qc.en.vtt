light<00:00:21.240> for<00:00:21.720> a<00:00:21.750> high<00:00:21.960> mileage<00:00:22.310> trainer<00:00:23.310> that's

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
light for a high mileage trainer that's

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.960 
light for a high mileage trainer that's
not<00:00:23.820> considered<00:00:24.740> quote-unquote<00:00:25.740> minimal<00:00:26.310> so

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
not considered quote-unquote minimal so

they're doing with it it feels really

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.600 
they're doing with it it feels really
light<00:00:39.809> anyway<00:00:40.620> let's<00:00:41.040> give<00:00:41.219> you<00:00:41.309> the<00:00:41.430> major

light anyway let's give you the major
updates<00:00:42.120> on<00:00:42.329> here<00:00:42.629> essentially<00:00:43.379> a<00:00:43.710> little

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
updates on here essentially a little

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.750 
updates on here essentially a little
more<00:00:44.489> arched<00:00:45.210> wrap<00:00:45.450> here<00:00:45.780> through<00:00:46.760> right

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
more arched wrap here through right

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.160 
more arched wrap here through right
through<00:00:47.789> the<00:00:48.090> center<00:00:48.390> of<00:00:48.420> the<00:00:48.570> arch<00:00:48.809> where

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
through the center of the arch where

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.380 
through the center of the arch where
they<00:00:49.739> have<00:00:49.920> a<00:00:49.950> couple<00:00:50.370> stays<00:00:50.730> here<00:00:51.059> that<00:00:51.300> were

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
they have a couple stays here that were

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.529 
they have a couple stays here that were
connected<00:00:51.989> and<00:00:52.460> even<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:53.579> logo<00:00:53.940> on<00:00:54.090> this<00:00:54.329> was

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
connected and even the logo on this was

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.119 
connected and even the logo on this was
supposed<00:00:54.840> to<00:00:54.930> be<00:00:55.079> helping<00:00:55.680> with<00:00:55.739> that<00:00:55.980> our

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
supposed to be helping with that our

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.250 
supposed to be helping with that our
trap<00:00:56.399> so<00:00:56.820> I<00:00:56.850> think<00:00:57.149> some<00:00:57.629> of<00:00:57.660> the<00:00:57.840> lightness

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
trap so I think some of the lightness

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.229 
trap so I think some of the lightness
that<00:00:58.289> they're<00:00:58.649> doing<00:00:58.859> are<00:00:59.190> is<00:00:59.760> essentially

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
that they're doing are is essentially

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.029 
that they're doing are is essentially
just<00:01:00.480> the<00:01:00.600> older<00:01:00.899> lays<00:01:01.050> on<00:01:01.230> top<00:01:01.469> have<00:01:01.680> changed

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
just the older lays on top have changed

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.630 
just the older lays on top have changed
a<00:01:02.100> little<00:01:02.219> bit<00:01:02.489> and<00:01:02.699> so<00:01:03.180> where<00:01:03.390> you<00:01:03.510> see<00:01:03.719> those

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:04.640 
a little bit and so where you see those

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.649 
a little bit and so where you see those
lightened<00:01:05.640> up<00:01:05.729> there<00:01:06.000> there's<00:01:06.240> a<00:01:06.299> little<00:01:06.479> more

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
lightened up there there's a little more

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.810 
lightened up there there's a little more
mess<00:01:06.840> here<00:01:07.049> without<00:01:07.229> the<00:01:07.530> older<00:01:07.770> way<00:01:07.860> it<00:01:08.549> feels

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
mess here without the older way it feels

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.219 
mess here without the older way it feels
like<00:01:09.119> maybe<00:01:09.420> that's<00:01:09.720> what<00:01:09.930> they're<00:01:10.110> doing

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
like maybe that's what they're doing

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.820 
like maybe that's what they're doing
with<00:01:10.470> lighten<00:01:10.680> it<00:01:10.860> up<00:01:11.070> you<00:01:11.580> look<00:01:11.700> at<00:01:11.909> the

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:12.830 
with lighten it up you look at the

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:15.530 
with lighten it up you look at the
support<00:01:13.830> in<00:01:13.950> these<00:01:14.130> very<00:01:14.820> similar<00:01:15.299> support

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
support in these very similar support

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:16.670 
support in these very similar support
where<00:01:16.080> they<00:01:16.229> put<00:01:16.470> it

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
where they put it

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.620 
where they put it
how<00:01:17.100> much<00:01:17.340> is<00:01:17.520> there<00:01:17.729> how<00:01:18.060> much<00:01:18.180> cushion

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
how much is there how much cushion

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.300 
how much is there how much cushion
you're<00:01:18.750> getting<00:01:19.049> so<00:01:19.500> that<00:01:19.710> I<00:01:19.740> don't<00:01:20.100> think

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
you're getting so that I don't think

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.130 
you're getting so that I don't think
really<00:01:20.400> has<00:01:20.820> changed<00:01:20.850> the<00:01:21.299> time<00:01:21.570> when<00:01:22.020> you

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
really has changed the time when you

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.690 
really has changed the time when you
guys<00:01:22.259> get<00:01:22.500> to<00:01:22.650> the<00:01:22.740> bottom<00:01:22.920> of<00:01:23.159> the<00:01:23.220> shoe<00:01:23.430> and

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
guys get to the bottom of the shoe and

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.999 
guys get to the bottom of the shoe and
start<00:01:24.299> to<00:01:24.450> look<00:01:24.600> at<00:01:24.869> the<00:01:25.170> differences<00:01:25.710> here

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
start to look at the differences here

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.819 
start to look at the differences here
going<00:01:26.340> on<00:01:26.580> what<00:01:27.360> you'll<00:01:27.509> see<00:01:27.780> first<00:01:28.590> if<00:01:28.799> we

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
going on what you'll see first if we

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:32.800 
going on what you'll see first if we
look<00:01:29.100> at<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.340> hill<00:01:29.549> this<00:01:30.090> one<00:01:30.360> wasn't<00:01:30.810> really

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810 
look at the hill this one wasn't really

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.539 
look at the hill this one wasn't really
split<00:01:33.810> up<00:01:34.020> or<00:01:34.290> split<00:01:34.680> apart<00:01:34.920> in<00:01:35.130> these<00:01:35.280> three

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
split up or split apart in these three

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.569 
split up or split apart in these three
pods<00:01:35.820> it<00:01:36.479> it<00:01:36.900> was<00:01:37.170> a<00:01:37.200> little<00:01:37.619> bit<00:01:37.770> but<00:01:37.979> it<00:01:38.189> still

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
pods it it was a little bit but it still

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.999 
pods it it was a little bit but it still
felt<00:01:38.909> maybe<00:01:39.600> a<00:01:39.780> little<00:01:40.140> stiffer<00:01:40.409> than<00:01:40.650> this<00:01:40.799> is

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
felt maybe a little stiffer than this is

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.920 
felt maybe a little stiffer than this is
going<00:01:41.310> to<00:01:41.490> what<00:01:42.090> we're<00:01:42.240> finding<00:01:42.570> is<00:01:42.899> that

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
going to what we're finding is that

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.690 
going to what we're finding is that
customers<00:01:43.530> right<00:01:43.710> now<00:01:43.740> just<00:01:44.189> putting<00:01:44.399> this<00:01:44.520> on

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
customers right now just putting this on

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.550 
customers right now just putting this on
and<00:01:44.909> filling<00:01:45.149> it<00:01:45.240> because<00:01:46.020> they<00:01:46.200> put<00:01:46.229> in

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
and filling it because they put in

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.649 
and filling it because they put in
deeper<00:01:47.189> flex<00:01:47.460> grooves<00:01:47.670> here<00:01:47.970> and<00:01:48.149> really<00:01:48.420> kind

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
deeper flex grooves here and really kind

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.270 
deeper flex grooves here and really kind
of<00:01:48.750> decoupled<00:01:49.290> that<00:01:49.439> you're<00:01:49.920> gonna<00:01:50.040> have<00:01:50.220> a

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
of decoupled that you're gonna have a

what

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 
what

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:12.690 
what
they're<00:02:10.929> doing<00:02:11.170> with<00:02:11.380> that<00:02:11.410> is<00:02:11.830> allowing<00:02:12.430> for

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
they're doing with that is allowing for

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.760 
they're doing with that is allowing for
a<00:02:12.940> front-end<00:02:13.630> that<00:02:13.780> feels<00:02:14.050> a<00:02:14.200> little<00:02:14.349> bit<00:02:14.560> more

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:14.770 
a front-end that feels a little bit more

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:18.180 
a front-end that feels a little bit more
flexible<00:02:15.340> as<00:02:15.520> well<00:02:16.000> so<00:02:16.830> those<00:02:17.830> are<00:02:17.980> the<00:02:18.040> major

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
flexible as well so those are the major

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:21.900 
flexible as well so those are the major
updates<00:02:18.610> again<00:02:19.060> a<00:02:19.330> little<00:02:19.840> more<00:02:20.910> substantial

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
they had on the guide 5-2 so essentially

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:28.979 
they had on the guide 5-2 so essentially

00:02:28.979 --> 00:02:28.989 
a shoe that's going to be a little more

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:31.710 
a shoe that's going to be a little more
flexible<00:02:29.230> it<00:02:29.769> looks<00:02:29.980> like<00:02:30.220> and<00:02:30.569> saved<00:02:31.569> a

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
flexible it looks like and saved a

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.300 
flexible it looks like and saved a
couple<00:02:31.870> of<00:02:32.080> ounces<00:02:32.200> in<00:02:32.620> the<00:02:32.709> waiting<00:02:32.980> room<00:02:33.130> and

couple of ounces in the waiting room and

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.880 
couple of ounces in the waiting room and
we'll<00:02:34.269> see<00:02:34.480> how<00:02:35.050> they<00:02:35.230> feel<00:02:35.410> right<00:02:35.680> now<00:02:35.860> I
