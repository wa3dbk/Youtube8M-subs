00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.950
 face this challenge of the looser klub me 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:11.160
 I'm already sneak am I producers 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:13.259
 not over 2003 labels to both 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.450
 modern castings like a state text message 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.130
 goerges nice guy since two of the causes 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.990
 like that you'll go fuck your mother 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.060
 we had noticed we were friends before 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.650
 to make music that we did not 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.630
 that we were a natural poet to 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.039
 music together but we were great 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.539
 young and some I do not know 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.529
 necessarily good and we quickly saw 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.130
 we did not have the same desires 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.710
 arts 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.420
 you will know if we had continued the club 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.940
 Isérois were both kits 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.140
 very much all the time which is not bad 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.700
 and then these ten years also because 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.640
 during those ten years could not both 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.800
 tried a lot of stuff musically so 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.600
 suddenly we did not necessarily have 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.890
 tips to prove yourself 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.300
 to each other and so suddenly 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.160
 could just be an album that 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.170
 did it in a fun way 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.520
 in fact I think it was for everyone 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.860
 both it was true a recreation 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.600
 in the subway I was counting sheep for 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.949
 do not get in the form of a drop 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:05.900
 ok I agree but it's because 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:09.420
 you live all that I say nothing 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:11.010
 no I do not think so I think that precisely 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.360
 it's an album that came from colors 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.799
 which is in any case that seems a lot 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.780
 lighter like and other albums 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.240
 because from the catalog precisely 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.680
 it was being fun it was 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.840
 the writing is much more consistent 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.030
 others our era that I could do 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.409
 it is especially the apple of cat after 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.820
 you scratch behind there really 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.170
 but if you listen a bit like that 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.450
 with one ear precisely I thought 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.189
 to a lawyer or easy to access that the 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.540
 some of my two albums I do not think 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:36.329
 that we can call it an album of the 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.869
 mature and given the age that I have I think 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.869
 that all my albums 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:42.880
 were created to 6 do me PASJ 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:44.439
 expected 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.250
 more sums due are all land to 

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:48.810
 Earth 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:48.810
 screams of planetarium and 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.830
 there is no clash but it's a trick 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:54.390
 it's more and more global in fact if you 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:57.300
 look even in the united states do you see 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:59.850
 a lot of little you see what 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:01.890
 karim will return mode / ap / Teachers 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.290
 you are just bathing everything I just say that 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.210
 because we have experienced it this 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.650
 period that all these young fantasies 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.060
 so suddenly less 30 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:10.950
 and I speak as an auditor conques 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.110
 report that it does not interest me necessarily 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.030
 it's good because we have 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.770
 ate the pi too much we ate india is 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.540
 here and we had nice heating or the 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:20.250
 clicked on stage I saw the x men on 7 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.630
 so suddenly when I see kids 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.120
 who arrives by resuming a little the same 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:25.410
 blur or that's not interesting to me if 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.500
 I was 15 years old head that I find at his 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:29.730
 dead table but suddenly this is it 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.350
 always a pity that the music is going 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:33.660
 too much looking back now nothing 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:35.640
 again I can take it like that 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.990
 but the thing was to say that 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.280
 today for example people who 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:39.690
 are thoroughly in the marks us when 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.010
 we were younger it was brands 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.150
 of young people now they are in the 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.530
 toilet in your arms precisely in 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.730
 eight years we sold street and even made them 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.020
 15 year olds are good something 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.280
 that even critics who wins 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:48.990
 mingling life can not afford in fact 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.660
 and they will prefer to buy fake ones 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:53.070
 just stuff for this thing to appear in 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.209
 did that rather that I tried 

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:56.489
 to show me I find it completely 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:58.739
 davis this year at cotton when we 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:00.270
 not win his life from two of the processes 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:02.100
 everything in a nasty thing not having a 

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:03.390
 fake rolex or something site has it all 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:05.459
 known to pay you so much better but 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:07.769
 why go buy something crazy and that 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:08.820
 is also to talk about that for the 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:10.470
 music also there are toys you 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:12.180
 prefer ben side the soul uncle while 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:14.370
 you can go listen to a curtis mayfield 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.780
 and it was more yielding more to bounce 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:17.640
 on that thing too you only see 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:19.320
 of this lack of culture means with 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.850
 internat you can have access to any 

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:21.360
 what we have no more excuses for not 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:22.830
 to be cultivated 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:24.660
 so it's a shame to go 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:25.860
 listen to force to an example but no 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:27.900
 closed but it's still sad 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:29.640
 once on the ground there was a million votes 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:32.310
 in the artist super good why 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:34.080
 listen to this thing yeah sipa that's 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:35.760
 still ridiculous when you go to mcdo 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:37.350
 grant 4 guerman to the cashier who 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.890
 take a peak at 4 and have them all 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:42.430
 bananas elbow 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:44.140
 vuitton belts do weird well 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:46.030
 something that will not you see it's not 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:47.560
 normal but why are you ready for this 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:50.380
 belt there but you are four to 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:52.540
 you pay for thin drinks and there are 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:54.930
 a time when it's not you or things 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:54.930
 We're talking about 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.590
 printing with other groups too 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:05.810
 often in the early 2000s 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:07.730
 to open certain certain doors you 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:09.710
 see two were the first to do this 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:11.540
 a certain style to a certain style of 

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:14.360
 music and it's true that sometimes you 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:16.010
 see guys who now take this 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:17.810
 stuff there but without a job doing 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:19.489
 pretending we are super new 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:21.200
 and everything is meaning and I think you're going 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:22.880
 in music it's super normal to 

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:24.140
 to be inspired by what was fabre but 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:27.440
 it's good to recognize you see it's 

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:29.630
 the minimum that sharp and I always 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:31.400
 a little bag it's true that you 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:33.260
 ringera know that for the football is 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:34.210
 as if buck and help a lot of 

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:39.069
 chips 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:40.210
 love is happy that I told him 

00:04:39.069 --> 00:04:41.979
 they did not know specifically 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:44.830
 is that the more there are tétouan shots and 

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:46.330
 the terms and everything he does 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:47.710
 today of what he could do by 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:50.520
 the past at home I think not to mention 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:54.009
 Does the noc speak? 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:57.520
 but the ace masnières that guy is great 

00:04:54.009 --> 00:04:58.030
 fan here is all the music is a 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:00.970
 small medium 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:04.870
 the guy is he landed from when he 

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:09.250
 came to opponents I had a 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:11.410
 little question was able to mix very funny 

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:11.919
 do not you know it's just his 

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:15.190
 passion 

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:17.620
 abbiati fiscalité I mix with sleeping with 

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:18.560
 marcel aymé rossi both boom 

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:20.450
 Africa 

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:23.450
 it's not your skin harper offers 

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:25.130
 promise stage 1 - smoking status is 

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:26.720
 always complicated josh man to 

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:28.520
 record collectors and often I 

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:30.650
 will recover 20 points you will 

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:31.970
 recover from the 70s that's all that 

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:33.230
 will still sealed so that means it's 

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:34.820
 sad means that the guy you see 

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:36.440
 huge and it always been great 

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:38.600
 complicated part if you look ya 

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:41.419
 very few artists who have exceeded a 

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:43.430
 decade here finally but who succeeded 

00:05:41.419 --> 00:05:45.590
 to last to the same ones who managed to make 

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:47.389
 if only eleven albums I think 

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:50.690
 that today is complicated but 

00:05:47.389 --> 00:05:52.760
 it was not easier yeah then 

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:53.990
 after that then it's just that 

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:55.550
 you watch him take a little more 

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:58.820
 overall it's an already it's a point 

00:05:55.550 --> 00:06:02.000
 which only concerns Westerners at 

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:03.350
 final because already in Asia 

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.090
 fun because here we see where we want 

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:06.500
 always see what point this tackle at 

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:08.180
 world it boils down to the west then 

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:08.750
 that I think that's not the case 

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:11.450
 Sadly 

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:13.130
 finally fortunately besides the most 

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:14.540
 early but I think it's 

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:16.400
 unfortunate how much people in 

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:18.470
 seeing the end does not consider summarize 

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:20.479
 squeezes that h and not me when I 

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:21.979
 traveling in the youngest in Morocco 

00:06:20.479 --> 00:06:23.450
 nobody could, for example, get paid 

00:06:21.979 --> 00:06:25.520
 with them droplets because 

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:25.880
 nobody tried all the real records 

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:27.740
 etc. 

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:29.030
 after for the Asian market it's 

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:31.070
 different is for example again and 

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:32.870
 this is where the pope dominated 

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:34.700
 you see the separate markets 

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:36.920
 consumers in all these countries there in 

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:38.960
 does they have music that is theirs 

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:40.340
 clean and completely dominating the 

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:41.810
 western music doing in the 

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:43.610
 fouta mattress lighthouse or one or two 

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:45.410
 stuff like that and in japan people 

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:47.120
 buy her emotions really sweat 

00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:48.890
 do not care about digital for example the 

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:50.330
 stuff on your cd and cd are quite expensive 

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:51.920
 but with people buying 

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:53.660
 that's exactly it's a problem 

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:56.060
 which concerns universality three 

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:58.130
 assholes like pascal acquired but at 

00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:58.880
 background it lasted I mean that's it 

00:06:58.130 --> 00:07:00.830
 how long do we 

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:02.780
 commercializes music at 6.7 on the 

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:04.520
 on the ladder of humanity it's nothing 

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:05.810
 at all so that's not why we're going 

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:07.040
 stop making music because 

00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:08.270
 the other shot we begin a budget 

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:10.310
 of 3 billion each time you think 

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:12.680
 that I dare to say I honestly 

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:14.570
 I have nothing to shake that industry 

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:16.040
 break your mouth in quotation marks you 

00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:17.930
 see it makes me neither hot nor cold 

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:19.730
 because why for it to be 

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:21.020
 the kind of investors the end that 

00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:22.460
 are not happy it's an act in 

00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:24.170
 florida way the artists are 

00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:25.760
 studies among seniors the UN universal 

00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:27.080
 frankly I have nothing to jerk about 

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:28.850
 if what we did when you see a 

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:30.200
 artist contract the artist there is the 

00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:32.150
 nothing remains to remove all 

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:33.650
 stuff on the price of a cd you see that they 

00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:36.260
 make scold break crates for 

00:07:33.650 --> 00:07:38.150
 to get to that would be just a bit of a 

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:39.320
 can make a good living that's what I 

00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:40.550
 believe it's ultimately because it 

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:41.870
 grave me is finished by saying within 

00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:43.100
 the interview that even today you see 

00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:44.540
 an artist who is a golden disc key 

00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:46.160
 you see that means they are 

00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:47.810
 tap three gold records it all the 

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:49.940
 time intervenes in gigs and everything 

00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:52.280
 that there are about six once 

00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:55.520
 now lifted all the stuff around 

00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:57.470
 2000 euros per month 48 

00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:59.000
 boston like all these cons I 'm leaving me 

00:07:57.470 --> 00:08:00.800
 create a freelance tells a joke 

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.509
 pedophile rocha mention haiti these 

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:05.560
 records that my salary that does not change 

00:08:02.509 --> 00:08:05.560
 despite the pretty margins
