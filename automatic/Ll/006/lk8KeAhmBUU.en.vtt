okay here's my 1965 Ford Mustang it's

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:08.900 
okay here's my 1965 Ford Mustang it's
got<00:00:05.730> a<00:00:05.759> 289<00:00:06.649> it<00:00:07.649> was<00:00:07.770> originally<00:00:08.250> a<00:00:08.280> two<00:00:08.670> barrel

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
got a 289 it was originally a two barrel

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:10.930 
got a 289 it was originally a two barrel
I<00:00:09.120> switched<00:00:09.360> it<00:00:09.480> up<00:00:09.570> to<00:00:09.750> the<00:00:09.929> four<00:00:10.110> barrel

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:10.940 
I switched it up to the four barrel

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:13.580 
I switched it up to the four barrel
problem<00:00:11.940> is<00:00:12.059> so<00:00:12.210> far<00:00:12.480> is<00:00:12.719> the<00:00:13.049> alternator

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
problem is so far is the alternator

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.390 
problem is so far is the alternator
wiring<00:00:14.160> I<00:00:15.619> know<00:00:16.619> for<00:00:16.800> sure<00:00:16.830> that<00:00:16.949> this<00:00:17.160> one's

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
wiring I know for sure that this one's

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:18.380 
wiring I know for sure that this one's
in<00:00:17.490> the<00:00:17.520> right<00:00:17.730> place<00:00:17.940> because<00:00:18.119> it<00:00:18.270> was

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
in the right place because it was

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.900 
in the right place because it was
labeled<00:00:18.980> this<00:00:19.980> one<00:00:20.220> is<00:00:20.310> in<00:00:20.400> the<00:00:20.490> right<00:00:20.670> place

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
labeled this one is in the right place

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.540 
labeled this one is in the right place
because<00:00:21.060> it<00:00:21.300> was<00:00:21.420> labeled<00:00:22.100> this<00:00:23.100> one<00:00:23.369> is<00:00:23.460> in

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
because it was labeled this one is in

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:24.950 
because it was labeled this one is in
the<00:00:23.640> right<00:00:23.789> place<00:00:23.970> because<00:00:24.240> it<00:00:24.449> was<00:00:24.539> labeled

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
the right place because it was labeled

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.720 
the right place because it was labeled
this<00:00:25.320> wire<00:00:27.199> not<00:00:28.199> sure<00:00:28.500> if<00:00:29.130> it's<00:00:29.400> in<00:00:29.490> the<00:00:29.580> right

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
this wire not sure if it's in the right

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:38.090 
this wire not sure if it's in the right
place<00:00:33.649> is<00:00:34.649> labeled<00:00:35.280> coil<00:00:36.030> left<00:00:36.300> side<00:00:37.070> so<00:00:38.070> I

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
place is labeled coil left side so I

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.400 
place is labeled coil left side so I
assume<00:00:38.489> it<00:00:38.640> goes<00:00:38.670> here<00:00:39.149> I<00:00:39.360> just<00:00:40.110> don't<00:00:40.320> know

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
assume it goes here I just don't know

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:46.729 
assume it goes here I just don't know
where<00:00:40.590> the<00:00:40.680> other<00:00:40.829> end<00:00:41.070> goes<00:00:44.989> this<00:00:45.989> wire<00:00:46.320> as

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
where the other end goes this wire as

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.279 
where the other end goes this wire as
well<00:00:47.149> don't<00:00:48.149> know<00:00:48.329> victim<00:00:48.809> let's<00:00:48.960> connect

itself it appears to be yellow and a
black<00:00:59.550> yellow<00:00:59.879> wire<00:01:02.270> huh<00:01:04.250> this<00:01:05.250> one<00:01:05.489> as<00:01:05.610> well

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
black yellow wire huh this one as well

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.210 
black yellow wire huh this one as well
one<00:01:06.810> part<00:01:07.110> of<00:01:07.229> it<00:01:07.380> gets<00:01:07.619> wired<00:01:07.830> into<00:01:08.159> the

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
one part of it gets wired into the

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.890 
one part of it gets wired into the
alternate<00:01:08.729> because<00:01:08.880> I<00:01:09.150> know<00:01:09.210> that<00:01:09.479> those<00:01:09.659> it

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
alternate because I know that those it

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.130 
alternate because I know that those it
was<00:01:10.170> labeled<00:01:10.850> said<00:01:11.850> a<00:01:11.880> big<00:01:12.090> part<00:01:12.390> though<00:01:12.570> I<00:01:12.869> do

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
was labeled said a big part though I do

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.550 
was labeled said a big part though I do
not<00:01:13.500> know<00:01:13.710> where<00:01:13.950> it<00:01:14.100> goes<00:01:15.200> splitting<00:01:16.200> goes

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
not know where it goes splitting goes

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.240 
not know where it goes splitting goes
into<00:01:17.930> bunch<00:01:18.930> of<00:01:19.110> crap<00:01:19.409> and<00:01:19.439> then<00:01:19.799> it<00:01:19.950> goes<00:01:20.100> into

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
into bunch of crap and then it goes into

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:26.870 
into bunch of crap and then it goes into
red<00:01:20.960> that<00:01:21.960> is<00:01:22.140> what<00:01:22.350> it<00:01:22.439> sees<00:01:25.729> there's<00:01:26.729> also

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
red that is what it sees there's also

yeah<00:01:38.790> I<00:01:38.850> know<00:01:39.000> these<00:01:39.180> two<00:01:39.450> go<00:01:39.630> into<00:01:39.869> where

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
yeah I know these two go into where

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.130 
yeah I know these two go into where
they're<00:01:40.680> supposed<00:01:41.070> to<00:01:41.159> be<00:01:41.400> this<00:01:42.210> wire<00:01:42.540> here<00:01:43.020> is

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
they're supposed to be this wire here is

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.600 
they're supposed to be this wire here is
for<00:01:43.470> the<00:01:44.780> electric<00:01:45.780> choke<00:01:46.049> on<00:01:47.040> my<00:01:47.250> carburetor

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
for the electric choke on my carburetor

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.960 
for the electric choke on my carburetor
these<00:01:48.299> two<00:01:48.600> no<00:01:50.040> clue<00:01:50.070> what<00:01:50.340> they<00:01:50.490> do<00:01:50.670> I

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
these two no clue what they do I

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.139 
these two no clue what they do I
know<00:01:51.270> they're<00:01:51.479> supposed<00:01:51.659> to<00:01:51.720> be<00:01:51.899> there<00:01:52.020> and

00:01:53.139 --> 00:01:53.149 
know they're supposed to be there and

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:55.969 
know they're supposed to be there and
then<00:01:54.149> you<00:01:54.180> got<00:01:54.360> this<00:01:54.600> wire<00:01:54.899> which<00:01:55.470> is<00:01:55.500> here<00:01:55.890> on

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
then you got this wire which is here on

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.069 
then you got this wire which is here on
the<00:01:56.070> right<00:01:56.250> side<00:01:56.490> of<00:01:56.820> the<00:01:57.270> coil<00:01:57.540> which<00:01:57.840> goes

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
the right side of the coil which goes

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:03.520 
the right side of the coil which goes
down<00:01:58.290> into<00:01:58.530> the<00:01:59.810> starter

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:03.530 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:06.580 

here's<00:02:04.250> my<00:02:04.580> positive<00:02:05.390> cable<00:02:05.630> terminal<00:02:06.350> which

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:06.590 
here's my positive cable terminal which

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.340 
here's my positive cable terminal which
I<00:02:06.710> know<00:02:06.770> goes<00:02:07.070> into<00:02:07.540> coil<00:02:08.540> left<00:02:08.750> side<00:02:08.960> because

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:09.350 
I know goes into coil left side because

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:15.880 
I know goes into coil left side because
it's<00:02:09.530> labeled<00:02:12.190> and<00:02:13.190> here<00:02:13.820> is<00:02:14.890> negative

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
it's labeled and here is negative

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:18.490 
it's labeled and here is negative
terminal<00:02:16.460> wire<00:02:17.060> which<00:02:17.720> I<00:02:17.870> do<00:02:17.990> not<00:02:18.020> know<00:02:18.200> where

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
terminal wire which I do not know where

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.520 
terminal wire which I do not know where
it<00:02:18.590> goes<00:02:18.740> because<00:02:19.660> whatever<00:02:20.660> was<00:02:20.990> labeled<00:02:21.440> on

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
it goes because whatever was labeled on

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:26.790 
it goes because whatever was labeled on
here<00:02:21.560> is<00:02:22.630> gone<00:02:23.630> oh<00:02:23.960> no<00:02:24.650> this<00:02:24.710> is<00:02:24.950> too<00:02:25.190> Walt
