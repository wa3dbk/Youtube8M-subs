an<00:02:13.280> absolute<00:02:13.910> it<00:02:14.600> was<00:02:14.720> fascinating<00:02:15.590> and<00:02:15.890> it

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
an absolute it was fascinating and it

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.940 
an absolute it was fascinating and it
was<00:02:16.340> a<00:02:16.370> revelation<00:02:16.960> I<00:02:17.960> had<00:02:18.380> wanted<00:02:18.590> to<00:02:18.740> set

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
was a revelation I had wanted to set

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:21.610 
was a revelation I had wanted to set
something<00:02:18.980> in<00:02:19.460> the<00:02:19.640> 1920s<00:02:20.360> and<00:02:20.690> of<00:02:21.320> course

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
something in the 1920s and of course

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.610 
something in the 1920s and of course
really<00:02:22.040> sort<00:02:22.370> of<00:02:22.600> the<00:02:23.600> place<00:02:23.810> to<00:02:24.050> be<00:02:24.230> in<00:02:24.500> the

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
really sort of the place to be in the

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:26.530 
really sort of the place to be in the
1920s<00:02:25.220> was<00:02:25.400> New<00:02:25.520> York<00:02:25.640> City<00:02:25.760> I<00:02:26.030> mean<00:02:26.300> that<00:02:26.420> was

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
1920s was New York City I mean that was

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.180 
1920s was New York City I mean that was
where<00:02:26.720> things<00:02:26.930> were<00:02:27.170> really<00:02:27.320> happening<00:02:27.860> well

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
where things were really happening well

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:29.770 
where things were really happening well
things<00:02:28.580> were<00:02:28.700> happening<00:02:28.820> in<00:02:29.060> Paris<00:02:29.360> too

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
things were happening in Paris too

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:31.390 
things were happening in Paris too
but<00:02:29.930> I<00:02:30.110> live<00:02:30.500> in<00:02:30.590> New<00:02:30.710> York<00:02:30.860> City<00:02:31.130> and<00:02:31.370> so

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
but I live in New York City and so

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.580 
but I live in New York City and so
therefore<00:02:31.730> it<00:02:32.210> made<00:02:32.390> the<00:02:32.540> research<00:02:32.840> a<00:02:33.170> little

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590 
therefore it made the research a little

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:36.910 
therefore it made the research a little
more<00:02:33.770> a<00:02:34.100> little<00:02:34.760> closer<00:02:34.940> to<00:02:35.180> home<00:02:35.650> but<00:02:36.650> it<00:02:36.800> was

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
more a little closer to home but it was

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.400 
more a little closer to home but it was
just<00:02:37.130> it<00:02:37.310> was<00:02:37.340> fascinating<00:02:38.150> to<00:02:38.300> me<00:02:38.330> I<00:02:38.930> think

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
just it was fascinating to me I think

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:42.040 
just it was fascinating to me I think
what's<00:02:39.800> so<00:02:40.040> interesting<00:02:40.760> is<00:02:41.150> to<00:02:41.390> sit<00:02:41.840> here<00:02:41.960> and

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.050 
what's so interesting is to sit here and

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:43.540 
what's so interesting is to sit here and
think<00:02:42.110> okay<00:02:42.320> this<00:02:42.440> is<00:02:42.620> a<00:02:42.650> city<00:02:42.950> I<00:02:43.010> have<00:02:43.340> lived

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:43.550 
think okay this is a city I have lived

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:47.140 
think okay this is a city I have lived
in<00:02:43.760> for<00:02:44.510> 20<00:02:45.200> years<00:02:45.500> and<00:02:45.830> the<00:02:46.460> city<00:02:46.670> that<00:02:46.910> I<00:02:46.940> was

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
in for 20 years and the city that I was

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:50.400 
in for 20 years and the city that I was
researching<00:02:47.540> seemed<00:02:48.290> completely<00:02:49.010> different

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 
researching seemed completely different

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:52.870 
researching seemed completely different
so<00:02:51.410> that<00:02:51.560> was<00:02:51.740> wonderful<00:02:52.040> but<00:02:52.430> I<00:02:52.490> think<00:02:52.700> one<00:02:52.850> of

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:52.880 
so that was wonderful but I think one of

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.830 
so that was wonderful but I think one of
the<00:02:53.030> things<00:02:53.210> that<00:02:53.390> I<00:02:53.420> really<00:02:53.840> loved<00:02:54.200> about

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
the things that I really loved about

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.930 
the things that I really loved about
researching<00:02:56.840> the<00:02:56.900> 1920s<00:02:57.590> and<00:02:57.800> what<00:02:58.310> became

00:02:58.930 --> 00:02:58.940 
researching the 1920s and what became

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:01.720 
researching the 1920s and what became
quite<00:02:59.330> interesting<00:03:00.320> to<00:03:00.440> me<00:03:00.560> we<00:03:01.460> talked<00:03:01.610> about

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730 
quite interesting to me we talked about

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:04.450 
quite interesting to me we talked about
the<00:03:02.090> past<00:03:02.330> is<00:03:02.570> prologue<00:03:02.990> and<00:03:03.320> I<00:03:03.860> could<00:03:04.040> see<00:03:04.160> so

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:04.460 
the past is prologue and I could see so

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:06.640 
the past is prologue and I could see so
many<00:03:04.670> parallels<00:03:05.030> between<00:03:05.390> 9<00:03:05.750> the<00:03:06.110> you<00:03:06.530> know

Shadows<00:04:00.049> fan<00:04:00.620> the<00:04:01.040> original<00:04:01.810> so<00:04:02.810> there<00:04:03.109> was

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:03.230 
Shadows fan the original so there was

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:04.270 
Shadows fan the original so there was
just<00:04:03.470> I<00:04:03.560> think<00:04:03.709> there's<00:04:03.950> something<00:04:04.159> about

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:04.280 
just I think there's something about

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:08.110 
just I think there's something about
horror<00:04:04.639> that<00:04:05.180> to<00:04:05.780> me<00:04:05.989> it's<00:04:06.950> a<00:04:07.099> catharsis<00:04:07.489> and<00:04:08.000> I

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:08.120 
horror that to me it's a catharsis and I

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:09.699 
horror that to me it's a catharsis and I
think<00:04:08.329> that<00:04:08.450> it<00:04:08.569> allows<00:04:08.840> you<00:04:09.109> to<00:04:09.349> explore

00:04:09.699 --> 00:04:09.709 
think that it allows you to explore

because<00:05:02.479> you<00:05:03.020> start<00:05:03.409> off<00:05:03.530> saying<00:05:03.830> I<00:05:03.979> would

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:04.190

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:09.530 
and then suddenly speakeasies lead you

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:11.170 
and then suddenly speakeasies lead you
to<00:05:09.740> someplace<00:05:10.070> that<00:05:10.520> you<00:05:10.550> never<00:05:10.909> thought

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:15.740 
know if there were car radios back then

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:17.290 
know if there were car radios back then
and<00:05:15.979> then<00:05:16.099> suddenly<00:05:16.520> you're<00:05:16.849> you're

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:17.300 
and then suddenly you're you're

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:19.960 
and then suddenly you're you're

researching you know aspects of

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:29.499 
researching you know aspects of
prohibition<00:05:27.349> and<00:05:27.409> how<00:05:27.729> they<00:05:28.729> actually<00:05:28.940> got

00:05:29.499 --> 00:05:29.509 
prohibition and how they actually got

00:05:29.509 --> 00:05:32.200 
prohibition and how they actually got
rid<00:05:30.259> of<00:05:30.289> if<00:05:31.070> there<00:05:31.460> was<00:05:31.550> a<00:05:31.580> raid<00:05:31.820> how<00:05:32.090> they

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:32.210 
rid of if there was a raid how they

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:35.260 
rid of if there was a raid how they
actually<00:05:32.389> got<00:05:32.630> rid<00:05:33.050> of<00:05:33.190> the<00:05:34.190> evidence<00:05:34.310> it's<00:05:35.030> a

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:35.270 
actually got rid of the evidence it's a

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:37.089 
actually got rid of the evidence it's a
fascinating<00:05:35.570> process<00:05:36.020> and<00:05:36.500> I<00:05:36.530> and<00:05:36.740> I<00:05:37.010> feel

00:05:37.089 --> 00:05:37.099 
fascinating process and I and I feel

00:05:37.099 --> 00:05:40.269 
fascinating process and I and I feel
like<00:05:37.909> that<00:05:38.750> I<00:05:39.229> think<00:05:39.620> that<00:05:39.800> people<00:05:39.979> sometimes

00:05:40.269 --> 00:05:40.279 
like that I think that people sometimes

00:05:40.279 --> 00:05:42.430 
like that I think that people sometimes
think<00:05:40.639> that<00:05:40.909> research<00:05:41.240> is<00:05:41.690> laborious

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:42.440 
think that research is laborious

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:45.130 
think that research is laborious
and<00:05:42.620> tedious<00:05:43.160> and<00:05:43.460> I<00:05:44.390> can<00:05:44.570> understand<00:05:44.990> why

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:45.140 
and tedious and I can understand why

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:46.390 
and tedious and I can understand why
they<00:05:45.350> why<00:05:45.590> they<00:05:45.740> think<00:05:45.800> that<00:05:46.010> but<00:05:46.280> it's

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:46.400 
they why they think that but it's

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:47.560 
they why they think that but it's
actually<00:05:46.880> to<00:05:47.000> me<00:05:47.120> I<00:05:47.150> think<00:05:47.270> it's<00:05:47.450> very

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:47.570 
actually to me I think it's very

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:49.720 
actually to me I think it's very
liberating<00:05:48.320> it's<00:05:48.890> very<00:05:49.160> freeing<00:05:49.550> because

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:49.730 
liberating it's very freeing because

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:51.640 
liberating it's very freeing because
rather<00:05:50.240> than<00:05:50.480> just<00:05:50.720> a<00:05:50.810> winnowing<00:05:51.200> where

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:51.650 
rather than just a winnowing where

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:53.800 
rather than just a winnowing where
you're<00:05:51.830> you're<00:05:52.280> kind<00:05:53.030> of<00:05:53.150> getting<00:05:53.480> down<00:05:53.630> to

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:53.810 
you're you're kind of getting down to

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:55.660 
you're you're kind of getting down to
the<00:05:53.930> to<00:05:54.290> the<00:05:54.410> very<00:05:54.650> fine<00:05:54.950> points<00:05:55.490> which<00:05:55.640> you

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:55.670 
the to the very fine points which you

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:57.970 
the to the very fine points which you
are<00:05:55.910> also<00:05:56.060> doing<00:05:56.420> you're<00:05:57.050> really<00:05:57.290> expanding

00:05:57.970 --> 00:05:57.980 
are also doing you're really expanding

00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:00.160 
are also doing you're really expanding
because<00:05:58.280> it<00:05:58.400> helps<00:05:58.640> you<00:05:58.760> build<00:05:59.000> your<00:05:59.180> world<00:05:59.570> it

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:00.170 
because it helps you build your world it

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:02.020 
because it helps you build your world it
does<00:06:00.530> a<00:06:00.560> lot<00:06:00.830> of<00:06:00.920> the<00:06:00.980> heavy<00:06:01.130> lifting<00:06:01.250> for<00:06:01.850> you

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:02.030 
does a lot of the heavy lifting for you

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:06.070 
does a lot of the heavy lifting for you
so<00:06:02.570> if<00:06:02.840> you<00:06:02.990> happen<00:06:03.230> to<00:06:03.440> know<00:06:03.770> that<00:06:05.080> Louise

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:06.080 
so if you happen to know that Louise

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:09.400 
so if you happen to know that Louise
Brooks<00:06:06.470> would<00:06:07.310> sometimes<00:06:07.580> call<00:06:08.120> in<00:06:08.390> sick<00:06:08.810> just

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:09.410 
Brooks would sometimes call in sick just

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:11.500 
Brooks would sometimes call in sick just
because<00:06:09.560> she<00:06:09.770> was<00:06:09.920> at<00:06:10.040> a<00:06:10.070> party<00:06:10.400> rather<00:06:11.270> than

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:11.510 
because she was at a party rather than

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:13.180 
because she was at a party rather than
show<00:06:11.750> up<00:06:11.900> to<00:06:12.050> be<00:06:12.170> in<00:06:12.260> the<00:06:12.350> follies<00:06:12.620> you're<00:06:13.010> like

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:13.190 
show up to be in the follies you're like

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:15.520 
show up to be in the follies you're like
well<00:06:13.460> that's<00:06:13.640> great
