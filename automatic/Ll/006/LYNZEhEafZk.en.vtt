 your rival in front or always face 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:28.299
 what and go forward 

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:30.429
 sometimes making fun of the side is easier if 

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:32.619
 I carefully observed taking 

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:34.929
 my rival aside and he logically 

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:36.939
 will try to remove the ball is where 

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:38.950
 I must take advantage of the error and go finally 

00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:41.350
 forward a basic rule that should 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:43.270
 know about how to make fun is that 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:47.080
 always and at all times you must have 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:48.549
 control over the ball instead if you 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:49.330
 You are one of those who covers all the time 

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:51.310
 ball 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:54.039
 you must tread and have full control 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:57.599

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:57.599
 to deceive but very effective 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.460

 how can you see the only difficulty that 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:26.010
 has is that you must reach the ball 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.720
 little before your rival at the moment 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:30.030
 that your opponent stretched his foot for the ball 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.010
 That's when you have to step on it and go towards 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:34.049
