00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:06.690
 hi i am a princess 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:09.510
 Today we will carefully consider the trailer 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:12.330
 fnaf movie and try to figure out 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.730
 some plot elements are required 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.150
 put likes my friends if you want 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:21.150
 see more videos on this game and 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:23.699
 let's start the most common 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.300
 question comments which were rendered 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.300
 friends 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:30.539
 does the movie sound like others 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.320
 Animatronics except Freddie will certainly 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.780
 my friends 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:37.350
 because at the very first trailer we 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.800
 Seen on stage 3 animatronics stage 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.059
 they 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:45.480
 Freddie and Chika therefore most likely we 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:49.590
 see also kimi and since this is a trainer 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:52.289
 it showed 1 Freddy and now let's 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.780
 Consider instead that 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:57.120
 to take place the action of the film already from 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:00.480
 5 nights with fredy 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.219
 cold warehouse can understand that the guard 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:07.140
 will work in stock 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:10.170
 night shift, what a warehouse and why? 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:13.080
 cold and here everything is very simple friends 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:16.409
 my if we look at the pizza building 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:19.439
 from the first trailer who is the size she 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:22.680
 almost like a supermarket building so much 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.520
 huge that fit a few 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.490
 amusement rides 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:29.310
 Lots of slot machines and huge 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:32.729
 the stage on which they performed 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:35.729
 animatronics and of course this 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:38.970
 huge building there is a big warehouse but 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:41.340
 why warehouse cold ask you here 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.500
 we can assume that since this place 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.530
 is the first match with pizzeria 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.880
 it is most likely stored in this warehouse 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.640
 pizza and 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.820
 therefore, the stock should be cold 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:57.329
 temperature to pizza 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:59.670
 remained fresh at all will guard 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:00.600
 monitor all buildings 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.909
 pizzerias 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.670
 but since the guard room is located 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:06.299
 next to the warehouse then to get on 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.940
 the scene 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:12.450
 amusement hall or other rooms 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:14.700
 need to go through the warehouse therefore 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:17.269
 the action of the film will be basically 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:20.160
 happen in this warehouse 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:23.130
 The next question is that animatronics 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:26.160
 do in stock when they should 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:28.769
 being on stage there are two 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:31.580
 option the first option is that 

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:35.370
 animatronics as in the game can freely 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:38.640
 1st all pizzerias and can sometimes go 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:41.459
 even to the warehouse and meet with the guard 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:44.310
 for before you close the ambitions of all 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:47.180
 animatronics removes from the scene to the warehouse 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:51.750
 which they are in until morning 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:54.630
 then again brought to the stage in general 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:55.890
 At first glance, the filmmakers want 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:59.220
 recreate 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:02.010
 exactly pizzeria and from the first part since 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:05.700
 there are three animatronics on the stages and in addition 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:08.040
 no check and freddy and maybe authors 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:11.900
 film want to uncover the plot 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:15.120
 1 part of the game that would be very cool and 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:17.450
 the next issue my friends we are in detail 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:19.910
 consider this trailer 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:21.379
 since he has some very 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:24.670
 interesting frames 

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:27.440
 release you liked my friends when
