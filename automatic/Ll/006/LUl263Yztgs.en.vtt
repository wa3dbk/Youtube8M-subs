00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:06.649
 htc is here today in berlin on the ifa 

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:08.389
 the desire 510 presented or 

00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:09.710
 at least the first time it showed 

00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:11.719
 he already has a press release 

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:13.759
 but now you get the good piece 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:15.679
 the first time to take the breast in the 

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:17.360
 take a hand and that's something 

00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:20.060
 I have to be special so on the one hand 

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:22.040
 in size 70 x 140 x 10 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:23.810
 Millimeter is not exactly right now 

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:28.010
 compact but above all things also from 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:30.080
 weight 158 ​​grams so the extreme thing 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:32.630
 but since it has so in hand has 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:34.310
 also a good reason because of this 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:37.190
 frame this once around 

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:38.329
 which is made of metal and 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:42.410
 not just a thin layer 

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:44.450
 or something but really very massive 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:46.970
 that you can feel it down here, too 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:48.410
 that also so once around for 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:50.300
 they like to do something decent 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:51.800
 it's just that in the hand 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.660
 right that says if I have one 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.800
 crispbread part or something like that 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:56.899
 that then in my back pocket 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.070
 breaks and I think so too 

00:00:56.899 --> 00:00:59.960
 this time I like it 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:01.489
 but I can try it 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.440
 At least in theory, imagine that 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:05.389
 This one falls a bit 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:08.270
 stuck away now and plastic bomber 

00:01:05.389 --> 00:01:10.219
 But plastic already exists 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.899
 on the back here as you can see 

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:14.329
 a bit dull and light like 

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:15.469
 rubberized act so the finger so 

00:01:14.329 --> 00:01:17.179
 gives a good touch 

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:19.549
 Nevertheless, I always try that now 

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:21.709
 putting it in the right light so completely 

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:23.929
 you can also get the fingerprints 

00:01:21.709 --> 00:01:26.119
 do not avoid so wipe now and then 

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:27.939
 you have to be much more important though 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:31.969
 I think that's the back 

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:34.999
 can lose weight precisely and that one can 

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:37.069
 can exchange battery 2100 

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:39.289
 Milliards had left 

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:42.319
 here has micro sim slot micro sd slot 

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:44.389
 Incidentally, the same will be up to 128 

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:47.749
 gigabyte supports full house 

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:49.039
 so to speak, I'm currently not internally 

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:52.219
 are only eight 

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:55.549
 gigabyte installed where to say so 

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:56.630
 must be recommended retail price 199 

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:57.590
 euro please beautiful 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:00.200
 that means it will probably be 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:02.659
 initially street prices of 180 euros or 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.719
 sinking something like this I think so 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:07.189
 You can ever close your eyes 

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:09.319
 but intensive users should still 

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:10.509
 know where did that have exactly that 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:14.379
 the memory 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:16.180
 net just 42 5 gigabytes ex factory 

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:19.540
 so that's what you call 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:20.439
 has users available so that's about it 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:21.819
 even if it may not be now 

00:02:20.439 --> 00:02:23.079
 quite the final software is as 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:24.450
 house number I should think so 

00:02:23.079 --> 00:02:26.290
 About to go 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.659
 if I do not know now 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:30.340
 intensive users the 500 apps or a thousand 

00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:31.450
 You can have apps though 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.340
 basically on the SD card 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:35.440
 but just move well known 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:36.819
 not all epss systems need to be in 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.560
 remain internal memory 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:40.599
 maybe someday it will be there 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.609
 closely but otto normal user has yes 

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:44.620
 statistically allegedly less than 50 

00:02:42.609 --> 00:02:47.260
 apps 12 of them are not 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:48.790
 so I'm really outsource 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.440
 There is another one for that 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:53.500
 It is a matter of particularity 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:56.139
 the first smartphone with android 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:58.329
 at least with 64 bit processor there is 

00:02:56.139 --> 00:02:59.980
 it the iphone 5 it now but here like 

00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:04.090
 also said with android is its app 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.870
 dragon 410 by qualcomm four cores 1 2 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:07.989
 gigahertz 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:09.129
 by the way, with this 64gb one 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:11.230
 gigabyte of memory I have 

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:12.639
 forgot to say that with the 64 bit 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:13.930
 Of course, that's always one of them 

00:03:12.639 --> 00:03:15.790
 history because first of all with you that 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:16.690
 operating system that supports that 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:19.239
 this is not the case here 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:21.639
 android 4 2 that means I needed the 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:23.470
 next version android l the now 

00:03:21.639 --> 00:03:24.970
 Sometime soon and should come 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:26.590
 I interpret that as well now 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:29.980
 it does not make any sense otherwise 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:32.590
 that htc already says so the thing 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:34.389
 I also get Android L and myself 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:36.250
 also need their own apps that is the 

00:03:34.389 --> 00:03:38.079
 now 64 bit support so 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:39.609
 for example, the htc browser or something 

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:41.889
 what can I imagine that the 

00:03:39.609 --> 00:03:43.480
 then 64 bits get noticed otherwise 

00:03:41.889 --> 00:03:45.069
 is there nothing of but I'm already 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:48.040
 excited I hope we can already there 

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:50.260
 before after, make 32 bit 64 bit 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:51.699
 if you notice something in the performance 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.180
 or at the benchmarks I'm already there 

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:55.000
 curious; excited 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:04:00.459
 yes to the display that of course that 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:01.750
 most important 4.7 inches 480 x 854 pixels 

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:05.139
 that would have to be if I get it right 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:07.000
 I roll over so give about 210 ppr 

00:04:05.139 --> 00:04:09.159
 is not a new record but now 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.139
 you may have some of this in the menu 

00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:12.879
 already seen are really small 

00:04:11.139 --> 00:04:14.739
 you have to say you can really write 

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:16.780
 still read without problems so now for 

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:18.820
 multimedia fans but as I said otto 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:21.150
 normal users are enough 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:23.759
 By the way, you also know that 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:25.530
 10 6 so that either I drag 

00:04:23.759 --> 00:04:27.540
 drop is then can move or how 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:29.250
 You can also see folders here 

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:33.600
 he is closer to me now 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:34.590
 the well-known but the display I have to 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:36.870
 get rid of something else 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:38.310
 because I noticed that here now 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:40.680
 and I could not do it fast 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:42.210
 clarify if that is now a problem 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:43.860
 It is not quite the final 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:45.150
 hardware is or if that would be him then 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:46.949
 so stay here in the 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:48.570
 I can find the settings on the 

00:04:46.949 --> 00:04:50.910
 best see because if you are not there 

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:52.080
 just right on it I look trying 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:54.210
 this now but without reflections 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:55.830
 halfway hinzukriegen changes 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:58.260
 Immediately the presentation and so either 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:59.910
 brighter or darker and that is 

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:01.889
 of course a sign of lacking 

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:03.510
 quality that you used to have at times 

00:05:01.889 --> 00:05:06.180
 Cheap appliances seen nowadays 

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:08.490
 I thought we are beyond that though 

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:09.900
 Here it is now at least with this 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:12.240
 model that here on the ifa 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:16.590
 it is unfortunately shown so god 

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:17.729
 that one has to record that I have 

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:19.770
 Hope you can somehow recognize it 

00:05:17.729 --> 00:05:22.110
 but here it bothers me completely 

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:24.090
 extremely that they are quite stupid and then 

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:25.740
 I would say now only we know 

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:28.229
 Just wait and see how the final 

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:29.729
 I will then look like that 

00:05:28.229 --> 00:05:30.990
 no judgment yet 

00:05:29.729 --> 00:05:32.639
 no conclusive judgment about it 

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:35.280
 but I would do it all 

00:05:32.639 --> 00:05:38.340
 at least times to advise 

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:39.990
 to wait and see what comes out of it 

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:40.349
 but otherwise I would 

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:42.720
 say 

00:05:40.349 --> 00:05:45.449
 if that should remain fair to 

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:47.300
 while even 199 euros still too much in 

00:05:45.449 --> 00:05:49.800
 my eyes because no matter size 

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:51.599
 display resolution whatever did not matter 

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:53.159
 But the quality has to be correct otherwise 

00:05:51.599 --> 00:05:55.470
 you get annoyed afterwards maybe 

00:05:53.159 --> 00:05:58.139
 so wait and see 

00:05:55.470 --> 00:06:00.210
 yes the further equipment in principle 

00:05:58.139 --> 00:06:03.180
 everything on board what you need or 

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:05.880
 hspa that means downloads in umts nets 

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:08.849
 with up to 42 megabits per second both 

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:11.310
 name n bluetooth 4.0 so everything on board 

00:06:08.849 --> 00:06:13.340
 as I said yes I hope that's enough 

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:18.080
 times as a first impression of the HTC desire 

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:18.080
 510 here from the ifa in berlin
