World<00:00:47.479> Championship<00:00:47.960> is<00:00:48.140> a<00:00:48.170> long<00:00:48.409> way<00:00:48.589> off<00:00:48.769> so

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:49.640 
World Championship is a long way off so

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:51.069 
World Championship is a long way off so
it's<00:00:49.789> hard<00:00:49.940> to<00:00:50.000> say<00:00:50.089> how<00:00:50.479> that's<00:00:50.690> going<00:00:50.839> to<00:00:50.930> pan

00:00:51.069 --> 00:00:51.079
