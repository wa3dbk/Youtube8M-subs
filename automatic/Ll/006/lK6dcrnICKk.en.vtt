00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:11.630 
beam converter thingy whatever you want

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:15.299 
beam converter thingy whatever you want
to<00:00:11.690> call<00:00:11.809> um<00:00:12.490> first<00:00:13.490> pre-heat<00:00:14.089> your<00:00:14.269> oven<00:00:14.420> to

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:15.309 
to call um first pre-heat your oven to

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:21.250 
to call um first pre-heat your oven to
350<00:00:16.309> or<00:00:16.609> 325<00:00:17.150> I<00:00:17.260> prefer<00:00:18.260> 325<00:00:19.869> it's<00:00:20.869> really<00:00:21.140> no

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:21.260 
350 or 325 I prefer 325 it's really no

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.109 
350 or 325 I prefer 325 it's really no
reason<00:00:21.439> for<00:00:21.769> that<00:00:21.859> it's<00:00:22.039> just<00:00:22.100> slower<00:00:22.730> heating

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:23.119 
reason for that it's just slower heating

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:26.620 
reason for that it's just slower heating
and<00:00:23.269> less<00:00:23.420> of<00:00:23.449> chance<00:00:24.410> to<00:00:24.529> break<00:00:24.740> anything

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:26.630 
and less of chance to break anything

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:32.190 
and less of chance to break anything
of<00:00:27.349> course<00:00:27.590> remove<00:00:28.090> everything<00:00:29.349> in<00:00:30.349> the<00:00:30.529> bulb

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:32.200 
of course remove everything in the bulb

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:38.890 
of course remove everything in the bulb

use our little scraper like this little

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:59.110 
use our little scraper like this little
chisel<00:00:54.680> knife<00:00:54.800> a<00:00:56.170> razor<00:00:57.170> blade<00:00:57.350> and<00:00:57.880> a<00:00:58.880> bunch

of<00:00:59.240> little<00:00:59.740> flathead<00:01:00.740> screwdrivers<00:01:01.400> as<00:01:01.640> well

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:02.950 
of little flathead screwdrivers as well

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:08.940 
of little flathead screwdrivers as well
of<00:01:03.950> course<00:01:04.010> with<00:01:04.340> me<00:01:04.460> a<00:01:04.489> glove<00:01:04.790> and<00:01:06.520> yeah<00:01:07.520> so

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:08.950 
of course with me a glove and yeah so

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:13.420 
of course with me a glove and yeah so
we'll<00:01:09.950> see<00:01:11.140> okay<00:01:12.140> so<00:01:12.230> now<00:01:12.560> that<00:01:12.590> the<00:01:12.920> headlight

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:13.430 
we'll see okay so now that the headlight

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:16.810 
we'll see okay so now that the headlight
has<00:01:13.550> been<00:01:13.730> baking<00:01:13.970> for<00:01:14.420> about<00:01:15.190> five<00:01:16.190> to<00:01:16.520> seven

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:16.820 
has been baking for about five to seven

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:18.850 
has been baking for about five to seven
minutes<00:01:17.300> take<00:01:18.050> it<00:01:18.170> out<00:01:18.260> with<00:01:18.380> your<00:01:18.530> handy

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:18.860 
minutes take it out with your handy

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:31.340 
minutes take it out with your handy
dandy<00:01:18.980> pink<00:01:19.460> oven<00:01:20.060> mitt<00:01:21.730> and<00:01:22.730> maybe<00:01:23.090> what

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.870 

so<00:01:32.350> I<00:01:32.380> probably<00:01:32.740> will<00:01:32.950> not<00:01:33.100> be<00:01:33.159> using<00:01:33.520> the

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:33.880 
so I probably will not be using the

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:39.360 
so I probably will not be using the
chisel<00:01:34.300> knife<00:01:34.600> on<00:01:34.930> these<00:01:37.410> I<00:01:38.410> usually<00:01:39.070> use<00:01:39.220> it

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:39.370 
chisel knife on these I usually use it

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:42.930 
chisel knife on these I usually use it
on<00:01:39.520> my<00:01:39.840> four<00:01:40.840> by<00:01:40.960> sixes<00:01:41.470> because<00:01:42.130> they're<00:01:42.340> well

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:42.940 
on my four by sixes because they're well

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:49.620 
on my four by sixes because they're well
square<00:01:46.259> but<00:01:47.259> what<00:01:47.440> I<00:01:47.470> usually<00:01:47.680> do<00:01:47.979> is<00:01:48.640> take

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:49.630 
square but what I usually do is take

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:53.100 
square but what I usually do is take
your<00:01:50.080> reasonably<00:01:50.470> and<00:01:51.130> just<00:01:51.970> try<00:01:52.900> to<00:01:52.930> get

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:53.110 
your reasonably and just try to get

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:55.190 
your reasonably and just try to get
under<00:01:53.380> it<00:01:53.410> cuz<00:01:53.650> it's<00:01:53.830> kind<00:01:54.250> of<00:01:54.400> got<00:01:54.550> a<00:01:54.580> lip<00:01:54.910> and

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
under it cuz it's kind of got a lip and

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.380 
under it cuz it's kind of got a lip and
just<00:01:56.200> go<00:01:56.410> around<00:01:56.530> it<00:01:56.890> and<00:01:57.009> try<00:01:57.729> to<00:01:57.820> cut<00:01:58.060> as<00:01:58.210> much

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:58.390 
just go around it and try to cut as much

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:05.180 
just go around it and try to cut as much
glue<00:01:58.720> as<00:01:58.750> you<00:01:58.930> can<00:02:01.680> you<00:02:02.680> know<00:02:02.770> this<00:02:03.100> is<00:02:03.399> very

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:05.190 
glue as you can you know this is very

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:13.860 
glue as you can you know this is very
tedious<00:02:06.190> and<00:02:07.679> will<00:02:08.679> test<00:02:08.950> your<00:02:09.190> patience<00:02:12.870> but

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
tedious and will test your patience but

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.260 
tedious and will test your patience but
this<00:02:14.320> is<00:02:14.650> the<00:02:14.800> easiest<00:02:15.100> way<00:02:15.250> I<00:02:15.280> found<00:02:15.580> to<00:02:15.880> do<00:02:16.150> it

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:16.270 
this is the easiest way I found to do it

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:19.020 
this is the easiest way I found to do it
excite<00:02:16.570> broken<00:02:16.930> one<00:02:17.340> before<00:02:18.340> already<00:02:18.760> just

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
excite broken one before already just

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:20.880 
excite broken one before already just
crying<00:02:19.390> on<00:02:19.660> it

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
crying on it

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:28.949 
crying on it
I<00:02:23.220> usually<00:02:24.220> have<00:02:24.370> to<00:02:24.550> heat<00:02:26.489> the<00:02:27.690> headlight<00:02:28.690> or

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:28.959 
I usually have to heat the headlight or

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:31.470 
I usually have to heat the headlight or
bake<00:02:29.650> it<00:02:29.860> three<00:02:30.130> or<00:02:30.220> four<00:02:30.430> times<00:02:30.640> before<00:02:31.180> I<00:02:31.390> can

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
bake it three or four times before I can

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.259 
bake it three or four times before I can
get<00:02:31.690> the<00:02:31.840> lens<00:02:32.019> off<00:02:32.260> so<00:02:32.680> it<00:02:33.459> takes<00:02:33.730> about<00:02:33.910> four

00:02:34.259 --> 00:02:34.269 
get the lens off so it takes about four

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:38.930 
get the lens off so it takes about four
to<00:02:34.299> five<00:02:34.390> minutes<00:02:34.810> for<00:02:34.930> me<00:02:34.989> to<00:02:35.080> get<00:02:35.230> one<00:02:35.410> off

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.979 

but<00:02:39.940> you<00:02:40.870> can<00:02:41.049> get<00:02:41.230> a<00:02:41.440> small<00:02:41.920> screwdriver<00:02:42.160> and

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:42.989 
but you can get a small screwdriver and

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:46.770 
but you can get a small screwdriver and
pry<00:02:43.989> it<00:02:44.110> away<00:02:44.590> from<00:02:44.920> it<00:02:45.040> a<00:02:45.130> little<00:02:45.250> bit<00:02:45.660> but<00:02:46.660> not

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
pry it away from it a little bit but not

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:53.190 
pry it away from it a little bit but not
much<00:02:51.180> and<00:02:52.180> you<00:02:52.360> don't<00:02:52.510> know<00:02:52.720> if<00:02:52.810> you<00:02:52.870> can<00:02:53.019> hear

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
much and you don't know if you can hear

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:54.449 
much and you don't know if you can hear
or<00:02:53.290> not<00:02:53.410> but<00:02:53.590> you<00:02:53.650> can<00:02:53.769> kind<00:02:54.010> of<00:02:54.070> hear<00:02:54.190> the<00:02:54.310> glue

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:54.459 
or not but you can kind of hear the glue

00:02:54.459 --> 00:03:01.890 
or not but you can kind of hear the glue
separating<00:02:59.310> but<00:03:00.310> yeah<00:03:00.459> just<00:03:00.850> keep<00:03:01.360> doing<00:03:01.690> this

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
separating but yeah just keep doing this

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.140 
separating but yeah just keep doing this
until<00:03:02.380> it<00:03:02.530> comes<00:03:02.650> off<00:03:02.860> it's<00:03:03.100> usually<00:03:03.310> it's

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.150 
until it comes off it's usually it's

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.380 
until it comes off it's usually it's
nice<00:03:04.269> to<00:03:04.420> have<00:03:04.540> another<00:03:04.630> set<00:03:05.110> of<00:03:05.200> hands<00:03:05.440> but<00:03:05.769> I

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
nice to have another set of hands but I

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:13.180 
nice to have another set of hands but I
do<00:03:07.390> not

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.190 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:17.210 

so<00:03:14.190> you<00:03:14.910> can<00:03:15.060> see<00:03:15.780> it<00:03:15.900> start<00:03:16.680> to<00:03:16.739> set<00:03:17.010> right

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
so you can see it start to set right

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:23.300 
so you can see it start to set right
there<00:03:19.040> and<00:03:20.040> just<00:03:20.250> don't<00:03:21.380> don't<00:03:22.380> pull<00:03:22.800> and<00:03:23.099> pry

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
there and just don't don't pull and pry

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:30.650 
there and just don't don't pull and pry
you<00:03:23.819> got<00:03:23.940> a<00:03:24.410> twist<00:03:27.530> and<00:03:28.550> just<00:03:29.550> work<00:03:30.360> your<00:03:30.540> way

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
you got a twist and just work your way

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:31.220 
you got a twist and just work your way
around<00:03:30.810> it

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
around it

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:45.979 
around it
and<00:03:31.319> it'll<00:03:31.620> come<00:03:31.830> free<00:03:44.180> so<00:03:45.180> like<00:03:45.600> I<00:03:45.690> said<00:03:45.870> the

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:45.989 
and it'll come free so like I said the

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:51.770 
and it'll come free so like I said the
razor<00:03:46.140> blade<00:03:46.380> helps<00:03:46.650> a<00:03:46.890> lot<00:03:47.600> to<00:03:50.690> loosen<00:03:51.690> that

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780 
razor blade helps a lot to loosen that

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:56.750 
razor blade helps a lot to loosen that
up<00:03:54.470> but<00:03:55.470> next<00:03:55.799> I<00:03:55.950> got<00:03:56.040> to<00:03:56.160> heat<00:03:56.310> a<00:03:56.340> little<00:03:56.670> bit

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
up but next I got to heat a little bit

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:59.120 
up but next I got to heat a little bit
more<00:03:56.940> so<00:03:57.569> put<00:03:58.470> it<00:03:58.530> in<00:03:58.590> it<00:03:58.709> for<00:03:58.860> maybe<00:03:58.980> another

00:03:59.120 --> 00:03:59.130 
more so put it in it for maybe another

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:01.580 
more so put it in it for maybe another
five<00:03:59.519> minutes<00:03:59.880> or<00:04:00.750> so<00:04:00.959> if<00:04:01.140> yours<00:04:01.380> does<00:04:01.560> not

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.590 
five minutes or so if yours does not

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:04.250 
five minutes or so if yours does not
come<00:04:02.010> off<00:04:02.220> right<00:04:02.489> away<00:04:02.810> okay<00:04:03.810> so<00:04:03.900> it's<00:04:04.110> wait

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
come off right away okay so it's wait

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:05.780 
come off right away okay so it's wait
for<00:04:04.500> a<00:04:04.530> few<00:04:04.709> more<00:04:04.830> minutes<00:04:05.010> so<00:04:05.220> let's<00:04:05.519> see<00:04:05.700> if

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:05.790 
for a few more minutes so let's see if

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:14.809 
for a few more minutes so let's see if
we<00:04:05.940> can<00:04:06.030> get<00:04:06.120> this<00:04:06.239> one's<00:04:06.450> off<00:04:06.630> me<00:04:13.400> okay<00:04:14.400> so

00:04:14.809 --> 00:04:14.819 
we can get this one's off me okay so

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:17.509 
we can get this one's off me okay so
same<00:04:15.269> as<00:04:15.390> all<00:04:15.480> let's<00:04:15.690> just<00:04:16.130> work<00:04:17.130> your<00:04:17.400> way

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:17.519 
same as all let's just work your way

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:36.400 
same as all let's just work your way
around<00:04:17.669> with<00:04:17.970> the<00:04:18.060> razor<00:04:18.209> blade<00:04:21.019> margin

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:36.410 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:38.530 

I'll<00:04:37.160> show<00:04:37.460> you<00:04:37.520> as<00:04:37.700> soon<00:04:37.850> as<00:04:37.940> I<00:04:38.060> get<00:04:38.120> this<00:04:38.330> one

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:38.540 
I'll show you as soon as I get this one

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:41.230 
I'll show you as soon as I get this one
off<00:04:38.780> what<00:04:39.650> I<00:04:39.680> mean<00:04:39.920> by<00:04:40.130> it<00:04:40.160> has<00:04:40.550> a<00:04:40.580> little<00:04:41.030> lip

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:41.240 
off what I mean by it has a little lip

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:47.500 
off what I mean by it has a little lip
on<00:04:41.540> it<00:04:43.870> it's<00:04:44.870> kind<00:04:45.290> of<00:04:45.380> a<00:04:45.470> pain<00:04:45.680> but<00:04:45.890> I<00:04:45.950> also<00:04:46.510> can

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:47.510 
on it it's kind of a pain but I also can

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:54.840 
on it it's kind of a pain but I also can
understand<00:04:47.870> why<00:04:48.050> they<00:04:48.200> built<00:04:48.410> it<00:04:48.590> like<00:04:48.740> that

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:54.850 

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:57.640 

so<00:04:55.850> once<00:04:56.150> you<00:04:56.330> start<00:04:56.600> hearing<00:04:56.930> the<00:04:57.080> glue<00:04:57.260> crack

00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:57.650 
so once you start hearing the glue crack

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:03.340 
so once you start hearing the glue crack
and<00:04:58.510> separate<00:05:00.610> just<00:05:01.660> don't<00:05:02.660> apply<00:05:02.930> any<00:05:03.230> more

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:03.350 
and separate just don't apply any more

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:04.600 
and separate just don't apply any more
pressure<00:05:03.620> keep<00:05:03.980> the<00:05:04.130> pressure<00:05:04.340> that's

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:04.610 
pressure keep the pressure that's

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:07.120 
pressure keep the pressure that's
already<00:05:04.850> there<00:05:05.180> and<00:05:05.360> it'll<00:05:06.170> do<00:05:06.380> all<00:05:06.680> the<00:05:07.010> work

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:07.130 
already there and it'll do all the work

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:11.280 
already there and it'll do all the work
itself<00:05:07.510> you<00:05:08.510> ply<00:05:08.750> anymore<00:05:09.230> it<00:05:09.440> will<00:05:09.620> break<00:05:09.950> and

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:11.290 
itself you ply anymore it will break and

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:16.780 
itself you ply anymore it will break and
you<00:05:12.290> will<00:05:12.440> be<00:05:12.590> in<00:05:12.680> a<00:05:12.740> world<00:05:12.890> of<00:05:13.010> trouble<00:05:15.790> so

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:16.790 
you will be in a world of trouble so

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:19.410 
you will be in a world of trouble so
that's<00:05:16.940> how<00:05:17.030> I<00:05:17.060> broke<00:05:17.210> my<00:05:17.510> first<00:05:17.720> one<00:05:18.020> and<00:05:18.650> then

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:19.420 
that's how I broke my first one and then

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:24.100 
that's how I broke my first one and then
yeah<00:05:20.420> okay<00:05:22.360> this<00:05:23.360> won't<00:05:23.570> come<00:05:23.720> apart<00:05:23.810> right

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:24.110 
yeah okay this won't come apart right

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:59.709 
yeah okay this won't come apart right
now

00:05:59.709 --> 00:05:59.719 

00:05:59.719 --> 00:06:03.339 

so<00:06:00.289> you<00:06:00.799> can<00:06:00.949> see<00:06:01.099> how<00:06:01.869> starting<00:06:02.869> to<00:06:02.959> separate

00:06:03.339 --> 00:06:03.349 
so you can see how starting to separate

00:06:03.349 --> 00:06:20.350 
so you can see how starting to separate
quite<00:06:03.619> a<00:06:03.649> bit<00:06:18.610> most<00:06:19.610> of<00:06:19.759> the<00:06:19.819> cracking<00:06:20.239> you're

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:20.360 
quite a bit most of the cracking you're

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:22.209 
quite a bit most of the cracking you're
hearing<00:06:20.659> right<00:06:20.809> now<00:06:20.869> is<00:06:21.199> the<00:06:21.349> glue<00:06:21.589> not<00:06:22.009> the

00:06:22.209 --> 00:06:22.219 
hearing right now is the glue not the

00:06:22.219 --> 00:06:44.590 
hearing right now is the glue not the
lens<00:06:22.999> itself

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:44.600 

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:48.650 

like<00:06:45.600> I<00:06:45.630> said<00:06:45.960> just<00:06:46.070> apply<00:06:47.210> constant<00:06:48.210> even

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:48.660 
like I said just apply constant even

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:52.610 
like I said just apply constant even
pressure<00:06:49.910> if<00:06:50.910> it's<00:06:51.350> stuck

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:52.620 
pressure if it's stuck

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:55.070 
pressure if it's stuck
kind<00:06:53.130> of<00:06:53.190> how<00:06:53.340> that<00:06:53.490> is<00:06:53.670> right<00:06:53.850> there<00:06:54.030> take<00:06:54.960> the

00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:55.080 
kind of how that is right there take the

00:06:55.080 --> 00:07:00.850 
kind of how that is right there take the
razor<00:06:55.230> blade<00:06:56.720> just<00:06:57.720> slide<00:06:58.110> it<00:06:58.260> alongside

00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:00.860 

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:05.690 

don't<00:07:01.860> try<00:07:02.010> to<00:07:02.070> force<00:07:02.340> it<00:07:02.550> off<00:07:02.730> just<00:07:04.550> take<00:07:05.550> your

00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:05.700 
don't try to force it off just take your

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:16.160 
don't try to force it off just take your
time<00:07:05.880> with<00:07:06.030> it<00:07:10.700> like<00:07:11.700> so<00:07:12.680> so<00:07:13.680> I<00:07:14.990> just<00:07:15.990> thought

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:16.170 
time with it like so so I just thought

00:07:16.170 --> 00:07:19.760 
time with it like so so I just thought
it<00:07:16.350> but<00:07:16.620> I<00:07:16.830> was<00:07:17.370> talking<00:07:17.670> about<00:07:17.730> a<00:07:17.850> lip<00:07:18.090> is<00:07:18.770> that

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:19.770 
it but I was talking about a lip is that

00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:21.230 
it but I was talking about a lip is that
right<00:07:20.040> there<00:07:20.310> you<00:07:20.580> have<00:07:20.670> to<00:07:20.790> try<00:07:21.000> to<00:07:21.060> get

00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:21.240 
right there you have to try to get

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:26.660 
right there you have to try to get
underneath<00:07:21.540> that<00:07:22.190> to<00:07:23.190> cut<00:07:23.670> the<00:07:23.790> glue<00:07:24.830> but<00:07:25.830> it's

00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:26.670 
underneath that to cut the glue but it's

00:07:26.670 --> 00:07:31.370 
underneath that to cut the glue but it's
not<00:07:27.150> hard<00:07:27.450> it's<00:07:27.810> just<00:07:28.370> tedious<00:07:29.810> so<00:07:30.810> yeah<00:07:30.990> there

00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:31.380 
not hard it's just tedious so yeah there

00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:34.670 
not hard it's just tedious so yeah there
we<00:07:31.470> go<00:07:31.530> now<00:07:32.870> start<00:07:33.870> cutting<00:07:34.080> this<00:07:34.380> one<00:07:34.530> down

00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:34.680 
we go now start cutting this one down

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:39.080 
we go now start cutting this one down
take<00:07:34.980> out<00:07:35.160> the<00:07:35.310> lens<00:07:35.490> and<00:07:37.040> convert<00:07:38.040> it<00:07:38.160> there

00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:39.090 
take out the lens and convert it there

00:07:39.090 --> 00:07:43.070 
take out the lens and convert it there
you<00:07:39.180> go<00:07:39.560> so<00:07:40.560> you<00:07:41.220> going<00:07:41.490> over<00:07:41.810> what<00:07:42.810> you<00:07:42.930> need
