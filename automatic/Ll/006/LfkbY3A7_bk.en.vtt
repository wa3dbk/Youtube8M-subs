here's where it becomes interesting

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.770 
here's where it becomes interesting
every<00:00:56.530> other<00:00:56.800> group<00:00:57.430> of<00:00:57.670> sixteenth<00:00:58.120> triplets

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:05.890 
for the six notes outside I'm going to

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:09.210 
for the six notes outside I'm going to
play<00:01:06.070> the<00:01:06.280> same<00:01:06.490> exact<00:01:07.560> strings<00:01:08.560> that<00:01:08.920> I<00:01:08.950> would

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:09.220 
play the same exact strings that I would

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:11.550 
play the same exact strings that I would
play<00:01:09.490> if<00:01:09.670> I<00:01:09.759> were<00:01:09.820> to<00:01:10.030> play<00:01:10.240> inside<00:01:10.690> but<00:01:11.110> a<00:01:11.290> half

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:11.560 
play if I were to play inside but a half

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:19.890 
play if I were to play inside but a half
step<00:01:11.890> above

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:19.900 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:22.600 

if<00:01:20.900> I<00:01:21.110> speed<00:01:21.350> up<00:01:21.440> the<00:01:21.560> process<00:01:22.040> it<00:01:22.250> sounds<00:01:22.520> very

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:22.610 
if I speed up the process it sounds very

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:24.550 
if I speed up the process it sounds very
fusion<00:01:23.119> II<00:01:23.180> it<00:01:23.330> sounds<00:01:23.600> outside<00:01:23.960> it<00:01:24.229> sounds

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:24.560 
fusion II it sounds outside it sounds

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.440 
fusion II it sounds outside it sounds
complex<00:01:24.950> but<00:01:25.250> it's<00:01:25.400> not<00:01:25.790> because<00:01:26.090> you<00:01:26.330> know

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:26.450 
complex but it's not because you know

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:31.859 
complex but it's not because you know
how<00:01:26.570> this<00:01:26.780> works<00:01:27.020> let's<00:01:27.650> hear<00:01:27.860> it<00:01:27.950> full<00:01:28.640> speed

00:01:35.499 --> 00:01:35.509 
you can do the same concept by playing

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:38.080 
you can do the same concept by playing
the<00:01:35.750> outside<00:01:36.140> notes<00:01:36.409> a<00:01:36.530> half-step<00:01:36.979> below<00:01:37.490> and

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:38.090 
the outside notes a half-step below and

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:44.260 
the outside notes a half-step below and
your<00:01:38.210> work<00:01:38.509> just<00:01:39.229> the<00:01:39.530> same<00:01:43.180> thanks<00:01:44.180> for
