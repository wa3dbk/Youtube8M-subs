hi Katy Pilkington for CNET and today
we're<00:00:08.160> going<00:00:08.250> to<00:00:08.340> be<00:00:08.460> taking<00:00:08.760> a<00:00:08.790> closer<00:00:09.030> look

we're going to be taking a closer look

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:11.749 
we're going to be taking a closer look
at<00:00:09.450> the<00:00:09.570> shark<00:00:09.900> rocket<00:00:10.440> those<00:00:11.160> of<00:00:11.370> you<00:00:11.460> who<00:00:11.610> may

the<00:00:14.730> DC<00:00:15.030> 59<00:00:15.450> might<00:00:15.750> be<00:00:15.870> screaming<00:00:16.139> copycat

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
the DC 59 might be screaming copycat

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.980 
the DC 59 might be screaming copycat
right<00:00:17.039> now<00:00:17.190> and<00:00:17.580> there<00:00:17.730> are<00:00:17.990> undeniable

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
right now and there are undeniable

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.750 
right now and there are undeniable
similarities<00:00:19.650> between<00:00:19.800> the<00:00:20.100> shark<00:00:20.340> rocket

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
similarities between the shark rocket

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.400 
similarities between the shark rocket
and<00:00:20.970> the<00:00:21.060> Dyson<00:00:21.449> lightweight<00:00:21.869> model<00:00:22.050> but

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
and the Dyson lightweight model but

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.740 
and the Dyson lightweight model but
there<00:00:22.560> are<00:00:22.680> a<00:00:22.740> lot<00:00:22.980> of<00:00:23.010> differences<00:00:23.580> to<00:00:23.850> most

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
there are a lot of differences to most

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.050 
there are a lot of differences to most
obviously<00:00:25.380> the<00:00:25.529> fact<00:00:26.039> that<00:00:26.369> the<00:00:26.670> sharks

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
obviously the fact that the sharks

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.210 
obviously the fact that the sharks
hundred<00:00:27.390> and<00:00:27.480> $79<00:00:28.260> price<00:00:28.500> point<00:00:28.859> makes<00:00:29.010> it

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
hundred and $79 price point makes it

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.669 
hundred and $79 price point makes it
less<00:00:29.369> than<00:00:29.519> half<00:00:29.760> the<00:00:29.789> price<00:00:30.210> of<00:00:30.240> the<00:00:30.679> $499

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
less than half the price of the $499

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.010 
less than half the price of the $499
Dyson<00:00:32.189> another<00:00:33.090> major<00:00:33.329> difference<00:00:33.600> that's

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
Dyson another major difference that's

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.660 
Dyson another major difference that's
obvious<00:00:34.380> right<00:00:34.620> off<00:00:34.800> the<00:00:34.920> bat<00:00:35.100> is<00:00:35.340> the<00:00:35.489> fact

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
obvious right off the bat is the fact

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.459 
obvious right off the bat is the fact
that<00:00:35.760> while<00:00:35.910> the<00:00:36.090> dyson<00:00:36.450> dc50<00:00:36.870> 9<00:00:37.230> is<00:00:37.440> a

that while the dyson dc50 9 is a

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.229 
that while the dyson dc50 9 is a
cordless<00:00:37.920> model<00:00:38.070> the<00:00:38.399> shark<00:00:38.670> does<00:00:39.000> have<00:00:39.210> a

but<00:02:14.150> I<00:02:14.420> really<00:02:15.140> like<00:02:15.320> this<00:02:15.470> vacuum<00:02:15.740> because<00:02:16.130> I

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
but I really like this vacuum because I

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:17.860 
but I really like this vacuum because I
have<00:02:16.550> two<00:02:16.760> pets<00:02:17.030> that<00:02:17.210> shed<00:02:17.600> pretty

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
have two pets that shed pretty

have two pets that shed pretty
aggressively

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:18.770 
aggressively

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:20.920 
aggressively
so<00:02:19.250> that<00:02:19.400> day-to-day<00:02:19.940> carpet<00:02:20.420> maintenance<00:02:20.750> is

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
so that day-to-day carpet maintenance is

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:22.210 
so that day-to-day carpet maintenance is
something<00:02:21.260> that<00:02:21.380> can<00:02:21.500> really<00:02:21.530> get<00:02:22.040> out<00:02:22.190> of

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 
something that can really get out of

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:23.920 
something that can really get out of
hand<00:02:22.370> if<00:02:22.730> you're<00:02:22.880> not<00:02:22.910> keeping<00:02:23.270> up<00:02:23.570> with<00:02:23.720> it

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
hand if you're not keeping up with it

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:26.290 
hand if you're not keeping up with it
and<00:02:24.110> this<00:02:24.830> would<00:02:25.010> be<00:02:25.130> a<00:02:25.160> great<00:02:25.370> vacuum<00:02:25.610> for

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:26.300 
and this would be a great vacuum for

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:28.360 
and this would be a great vacuum for
that<00:02:26.810> daily<00:02:27.260> maintenance<00:02:27.710> just<00:02:27.890> run<00:02:28.130> it<00:02:28.280> over

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
that daily maintenance just run it over

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:29.980 
that daily maintenance just run it over
the<00:02:28.610> floors<00:02:28.910> really<00:02:29.180> quickly<00:02:29.660> and<00:02:29.870> then

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:29.990 
the floors really quickly and then

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.640 
the floors really quickly and then
you're<00:02:30.140> done

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
you're done

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.440 
you're done
and<00:02:30.740> then<00:02:31.160> you<00:02:31.250> can<00:02:31.400> pull<00:02:31.610> out<00:02:31.640> the<00:02:31.820> full<00:02:32.240> size

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
and then you can pull out the full size

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.240 
and then you can pull out the full size
vacuum<00:02:33.020> your<00:02:33.260> upright<00:02:33.710> for<00:02:34.160> your

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
vacuum your upright for your

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:36.820 
vacuum your upright for your
heavier-duty<00:02:34.730> weekend<00:02:35.390> cleaning<00:02:35.810> so<00:02:36.620> if<00:02:36.710> you

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:36.830 
heavier-duty weekend cleaning so if you

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:39.190 
heavier-duty weekend cleaning so if you
like<00:02:37.040> the<00:02:37.220> idea<00:02:37.310> of<00:02:37.670> customizing<00:02:38.660> your<00:02:38.780> vacuum

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
like the idea of customizing your vacuum

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.080 
like the idea of customizing your vacuum
perhaps<00:02:39.560> a<00:02:39.680> little<00:02:39.800> bit<00:02:40.010> more<00:02:40.280> than<00:02:40.460> the<00:02:40.610> dyson

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
perhaps a little bit more than the dyson

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:42.970 
perhaps a little bit more than the dyson
and<00:02:41.360> you<00:02:41.780> also<00:02:41.960> like<00:02:42.230> the<00:02:42.320> fact<00:02:42.530> that<00:02:42.650> this<00:02:42.800> one

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
and you also like the fact that this one

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.610 
and you also like the fact that this one
retails<00:02:43.130> for<00:02:43.430> half<00:02:43.670> the<00:02:43.820> price<00:02:43.970> at<00:02:44.620> 179

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
retails for half the price at 179

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.200 
retails for half the price at 179
dollars<00:02:45.800> then<00:02:46.550> I<00:02:46.610> would<00:02:46.790> recommend

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:47.210 
dollars then I would recommend

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:49.330 
dollars then I would recommend
considering<00:02:47.780> the<00:02:47.900> shark<00:02:48.140> rocket<00:02:48.560> for<00:02:48.950> CNET

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
considering the shark rocket for CNET

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:52.390 
considering the shark rocket for CNET
