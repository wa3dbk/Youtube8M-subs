00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:07.820
 this mazda 6 mhz seduced and I had it 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:10.230
 seen in picture I had found a lot 

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:12.900
 it's complicated because it's often 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.219
 a line 1 at mazda are a lot 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.230
 searched sure they found their style 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.930
 we'll even say maserati jeans seems that 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.150
 the reporters look behind and 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:24.779
 but before talking about all of this 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.400
 I have the boss France like you and with 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.019
 me you will talk to me about the 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.699
 skyactiv technology 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.520
 which makes it necessary to little explained 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.930
 to the people today the fight for the 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.700
 builders it's really 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.680
 polluting emissions the environment there 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.989
 must be able to reduce its emissions 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.239
 corporate fleets make very 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.739
 watch out for that so everyone comes up with 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.890
 I was going to say his technology with 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.120
 traille the hybrid the acts you have 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.100
 a specific approach is called 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.289
 skyactiv to you are three minutes to 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.329
 explain it to the general public then 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.550
 start with skyactiv technology 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.440
 for diesel engines then for the 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.690
 diesel engines all brands are 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.650
 parties by increasing their rate of 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.820
 compression at astronomical levels 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:09.450
 since we have now moved to 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:11.520
 rate that goes up to 16 18 for a vase to 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.229
 did inverse maza lowered his rate of 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.090
 compression the immediate benefits 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:18.960
 it is that we do not produce soot 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:21.170
 since we do not destroy the molecules 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.360
 in the cylinders com 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:25.700
 by compressing the enormously since have 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.320
 a lower compression rate on 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:30.710
 did not take soot we do not produce 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:34.159
 of nox so we have diesel engines that 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:36.200
 are already our thanks 6 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:37.729
 who will appear who will be 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.140
 Required for all 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:39.920
 vehicles on the market in september 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.330
 2015 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.759
 so this technique for grampus but 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:45.470
 it's very important obviously the nox 

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:46.610
 and swiss is really pollutants there 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:49.039
 we really talk about pollutants by not 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:52.899
 of co2 a hard blow that are for the 

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:55.789
 health you stated that the 

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:57.170
 carcinogenic and even if he said on 

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:59.479
 studies that demonstrate that in fact the 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:01.759
 two main sources of risk are 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:05.000
 actually the particles and lennox 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:07.220
 so with mazda technology we do not 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.200
 produces almost no nox or 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:10.399
 arthaud particles of combret nasa is 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.840
 really a brand of engineers you 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:13.760
 are you now finding yourself rate 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.440
 lower compression we have others 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.760
 elements on this technology and which in 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.590
 did why nobody had taken 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:21.930
 this road because it's complicated 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:24.989
 cold starts the clicks 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:26.879
 of the engine and so it's this bahamas coffee 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:29.610
 Damascus Damascus does a process or very 

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:31.560
 early we reinject pollution gases 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:35.760
 so even cold the vehicle works 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:37.980
 good but surprisingly quiet for a 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.780
 diesel will reach 4 6 1,275 horsepower 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.920
 I absolutely feel 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.379
 to lead a birth is very 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.790
 box and I confirm it and 

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:46.110
 some of your colleagues are coming out of 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.760
 cars by asking answered the 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:49.530
 diesel engine while they have an engine 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.610
 diesel but that does not mean agreement 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:52.500
 so let's go back anyway since 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:53.610
 appears nox in my ski and for the 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.260
 bad health but at the level of 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:57.360
 co2 emissions on this engine which is 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:59.130
 the most upscale 1,275 horsepower 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:01.500
 how many visual programs are there on 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:04.290
 a diesel had on a diesel engine 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:07.410
 150 hp you and you emit yourself without 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:12.000
 life grams of co2 you can see that 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:14.280
 some mid-range cars see 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.829
 the little cars and put everything 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:18.360
 as much then they are 175 horses I'm 

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:21.000
 say we are a little bit more 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:22.470
 are a little bit above me 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.269
 are at 119 will take body she is not 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:26.700
 misused and so if I'm not mistaken 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:28.440
 go neutral she's quite the 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:30.450
 neutral agree okay so during 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:32.280
 I have you on hand also in series 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:34.200
 i saw car thing we quit start 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:36.120
 we have a lot of gene equipment 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:38.190
 who had a radar controllers had to 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:40.380
 since our arteries you have what we 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:43.560
 call the missed aui who is there he at 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:45.510
 manual point anyway a pure clp 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:47.970
 the miss is a recuperator 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:49.919
 of energy not braking like the 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:51.840
 most of our competitors but at the 

00:03:49.919 --> 00:03:52.859
 deceleration is so how can that 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.560
 work and well just 

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:57.099
 because 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:58.340
 mazda engineers used a 

00:03:57.099 --> 00:04:01.099
 capacitor 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:01.940
 that is, as soon as you have a 

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:05.510
 deceleration 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:06.680
 off charges a capacitor in the 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:08.120
 capacitors it's something that 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:10.190
 is extraordinary because his cloak of 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:12.980
 electricity but it's not a 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:14.750
 battery that is to say that it does not hold 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:16.669
 not very long so know 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:18.109
 immediately distribute that so but that 

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:18.829
 relieves in all all the others 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:20.900
 electric elements 

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:26.240
 so he had that consumes less and that's it 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:27.560
 okay okay and I'm put a good 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:30.280
 Well, that's great, I'll go back to 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:30.280
 flying thanks a lot
