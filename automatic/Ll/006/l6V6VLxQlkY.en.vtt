these two image acquisitions stressing

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.960 
these two image acquisitions stressing
of<00:00:21.090> the<00:00:21.180> heart<00:00:21.390> is<00:00:21.600> achieved<00:00:21.960> in<00:00:22.109> two<00:00:22.320> ways

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:22.970 
of the heart is achieved in two ways

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:25.400 
of the heart is achieved in two ways
first<00:00:23.970> by<00:00:24.180> a<00:00:24.210> pharmaceutical<00:00:24.720> which<00:00:25.199> has<00:00:25.380> a

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
first by a pharmaceutical which has a

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.200 
first by a pharmaceutical which has a
similar<00:00:25.800> effect<00:00:26.130> on<00:00:26.340> the<00:00:26.460> heart<00:00:26.640> to<00:00:26.849> taking

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
similar effect on the heart to taking

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.580 
similar effect on the heart to taking
exercise<00:00:29.179> and<00:00:30.179> also<00:00:30.929> by<00:00:31.080> squeezing<00:00:31.410> a

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
exercise and also by squeezing a

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.819 
exercise and also by squeezing a
dumbbell<00:00:33.020> the<00:00:34.020> heart<00:00:34.230> needs<00:00:34.469> to<00:00:34.620> be<00:00:34.649> monitored

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
dumbbell the heart needs to be monitored

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.340 
dumbbell the heart needs to be monitored
carefully<00:00:35.489> during<00:00:35.670> this<00:00:35.880> period<00:00:36.149> so<00:00:36.870> an<00:00:37.020> ECG

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
carefully during this period so an ECG

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.470 
carefully during this period so an ECG
is<00:00:37.649> recorded<00:00:40.910> this<00:00:41.910> is<00:00:42.059> the<00:00:42.149> tip<00:00:42.270> that<00:00:42.420> allows

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
is recorded this is the tip that allows

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.209 
is recorded this is the tip that allows
us<00:00:42.840> to<00:00:42.960> see<00:00:43.110> what<00:00:43.290> take<00:00:43.559> some<00:00:43.770> pictures<00:00:44.100> and

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
us to see what take some pictures and

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.760 
us to see what take some pictures and
see<00:00:44.340> what's<00:00:44.579> going<00:00:44.910> on<00:00:45.059> okay<00:00:45.379> once<00:00:46.379> the<00:00:46.559> heart

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
see what's going on okay once the heart

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:47.750 
see what's going on okay once the heart
has<00:00:46.920> been<00:00:47.129> stressed<00:00:47.520> the

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760

Park<00:01:06.290> so<00:01:06.950> I'm<00:01:07.010> just<00:01:07.190> going<00:01:07.370> to<00:01:07.430> disconnect<00:01:07.820> you

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:08.000 
Park so I'm just going to disconnect you

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.790 
Park so I'm just going to disconnect you
from<00:01:08.030> all<00:01:08.300> of<00:01:08.420> the<00:01:08.480> machinery<00:01:08.840> and<00:01:09.200> then<00:01:09.710> I'm

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:09.800 
from all of the machinery and then I'm

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:10.990 
from all of the machinery and then I'm
going<00:01:09.920> to<00:01:09.980> ask<00:01:10.130> you<00:01:10.310> to<00:01:10.430> wait<00:01:10.550> in<00:01:10.880> the<00:01:10.970> waiting

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:11.000 
going to ask you to wait in the waiting

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.090 
going to ask you to wait in the waiting
room<00:01:11.510> because<00:01:11.690> it<00:01:11.900> takes<00:01:12.110> this<00:01:12.320> isotope<00:01:12.740> up<00:01:12.950> to

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:13.100 
room because it takes this isotope up to

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.100 
room because it takes this isotope up to
an<00:01:13.220> hour<00:01:13.370> to<00:01:13.490> reach<00:01:13.790> your<00:01:13.970> heart<00:01:14.120> and<00:01:14.720> then

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:15.110 
an hour to reach your heart and then

right<00:02:32.880> that's<00:02:33.060> it<00:02:33.240> we're<00:02:33.420> all<00:02:33.480> finished<00:02:33.750> now

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
right that's it we're all finished now

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.620 
right that's it we're all finished now
you<00:02:34.350> can<00:02:34.560> relax<00:02:34.940> we<00:02:35.940> will<00:02:36.120> be<00:02:36.240> doing<00:02:36.420> some

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
you can relax we will be doing some

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:37.850 
you can relax we will be doing some
pictures<00:02:36.930> of<00:02:37.020> your<00:02:37.110> heart<00:02:37.350> when<00:02:37.500> it's<00:02:37.680> at<00:02:37.830> rest

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
pictures of your heart when it's at rest

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.910 
pictures of your heart when it's at rest
and<00:02:38.430> that<00:02:39.030> will<00:02:39.180> be<00:02:39.300> later<00:02:39.600> I'll<00:02:39.840> give<00:02:40.740> you<00:02:40.860> all

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
and that will be later I'll give you all

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.290 
and that will be later I'll give you all
the<00:02:41.070> details<00:02:41.190> about<00:02:41.550> when<00:02:41.820> we're<00:02:41.940> going<00:02:42.090> to<00:02:42.180> do

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
the details about when we're going to do

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.600 
the details about when we're going to do
that<00:02:42.540> in<00:02:42.810> about<00:02:43.320> ten<00:02:43.680> minutes<00:02:43.710> a<00:02:44.040> cycle

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
that in about ten minutes a cycle

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:48.420 
that in about ten minutes a cycle
first<00:02:44.970> we'll<00:02:45.150> really<00:02:45.390> check<00:02:45.630> the<00:02:45.780> date

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:49.680

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690 
have a seat in the waiting room where

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:52.800 
have a seat in the waiting room where
you<00:02:49.810> were<00:02:49.959> before<00:02:50.849> nighty-night<00:02:51.879> thank<00:02:52.660> you

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:00.690 

right<00:02:59.140> here<00:02:59.380> we<00:02:59.470> have<00:02:59.500> some<00:02:59.680> processed<00:03:00.340> images

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
right here we have some processed images

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.180 
right here we have some processed images
and<00:03:01.060> we're<00:03:01.510> looking<00:03:01.810> at<00:03:01.930> the<00:03:02.110> stress<00:03:02.440> unrest

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.190 
and we're looking at the stress unrest

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:06.750 
and we're looking at the stress unrest
in<00:03:03.580> the<00:03:03.850> short<00:03:04.120> axis<00:03:04.710> stress<00:03:05.710> unrest<00:03:06.400> in<00:03:06.700> the

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:12.130 
in the vertical long axis and what we're

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:13.860 
in the vertical long axis and what we're
now<00:03:12.280> going<00:03:12.520> to<00:03:12.610> do<00:03:12.790> is<00:03:12.910> compare<00:03:13.300> isotope

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:13.870 
now going to do is compare isotope

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:16.400 
now going to do is compare isotope
distribution<00:03:14.590> in<00:03:14.770> the<00:03:15.250> stress<00:03:15.580> images<00:03:16.030> and

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
distribution in the stress images and

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:20.280 
distribution in the stress images and
the<00:03:17.410> rest<00:03:17.590> images<00:03:18.150> looking<00:03:19.150> for<00:03:19.510> reversible
