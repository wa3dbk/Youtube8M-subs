00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:12.629 

those<00:00:09.280> do<00:00:09.610> you<00:00:11.009> conduct<00:00:12.009> performance

00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:12.639 
those do you conduct performance

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:18.269 
those do you conduct performance
evaluation<00:00:13.539> and<00:00:14.160> to<00:00:15.160> you<00:00:16.410> give<00:00:17.410> the<00:00:17.619> rewards

00:00:18.269 --> 00:00:18.279 
evaluation and to you give the rewards

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:20.640 
evaluation and to you give the rewards
based<00:00:18.430> upon<00:00:18.880> the<00:00:19.119> performance<00:00:19.779> evaluation

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:20.650 
based upon the performance evaluation

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:23.939 
based upon the performance evaluation
and<00:00:20.890> the<00:00:21.640> reward<00:00:22.180> will<00:00:22.450> be<00:00:22.509> more<00:00:22.900> extrinsic<00:00:23.560> or

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:23.949 
and the reward will be more extrinsic or

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:27.150 
and the reward will be more extrinsic or
rented<00:00:24.460> or<00:00:24.699> be<00:00:24.969> intrinsic<00:00:25.630> oriented<00:00:26.320> I<00:00:26.559> think

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:27.160 
rented or be intrinsic oriented I think

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:28.859 
rented or be intrinsic oriented I think
there<00:00:27.369> are<00:00:27.399> two<00:00:27.579> things<00:00:27.790> yeah<00:00:28.300> you<00:00:28.570> need<00:00:28.809> to
