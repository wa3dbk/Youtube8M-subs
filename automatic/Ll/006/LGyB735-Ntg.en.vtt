00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.260 
hey see aircon is here just a quick
tutorial<00:00:04.770> to<00:00:05.279> show<00:00:05.310> you<00:00:05.580> how<00:00:05.910> we<00:00:05.970> did<00:00:06.209> the

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.270 
tutorial to show you how we did the

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.660 
tutorial to show you how we did the
goalkeeper<00:00:06.779> training<00:00:06.930> effect<00:00:07.470> in<00:00:07.649> the<00:00:08.400> first

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:08.670 
goalkeeper training effect in the first

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:10.310 
goalkeeper training effect in the first
shots<00:00:08.940> we<00:00:09.179> use<00:00:09.330> the<00:00:09.509> techniques<00:00:09.960> from<00:00:10.139> the

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
shots we use the techniques from the

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.009 
shots we use the techniques from the
cloning<00:00:10.740> tutorial<00:00:11.250> I've<00:00:11.400> made<00:00:11.969> earlier<00:00:12.509> to

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
cloning tutorial I've made earlier to

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:14.810 
cloning tutorial I've made earlier to
watch<00:00:13.049> death<00:00:13.469> video<00:00:13.769> for<00:00:14.309> detailed

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820

explanation<00:00:16.160> to<00:00:17.160> shoulder<00:00:17.460> with<00:00:17.490> me<00:00:17.820> we<00:00:18.120> just

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
explanation to shoulder with me we just

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.290 
explanation to shoulder with me we just
slow<00:00:18.630> down<00:00:18.660> because<00:00:19.620> we<00:00:19.920> filmed<00:00:20.370> at<00:00:20.460> 50<00:00:21.090> frames

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
slow down because we filmed at 50 frames

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.810 
slow down because we filmed at 50 frames
per<00:00:21.570> second<00:00:22.020> or<00:00:22.140> camera<00:00:23.100> couldn't<00:00:23.430> do<00:00:23.610> better

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
per second or camera couldn't do better

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.750 
per second or camera couldn't do better
we<00:00:24.780> had<00:00:24.930> to<00:00:25.080> use<00:00:25.110> a<00:00:25.290> lot<00:00:25.680> of<00:00:25.710> frame<00:00:26.220> blending<00:00:26.460> to

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
we had to use a lot of frame blending to

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.940 
we had to use a lot of frame blending to
make<00:00:26.940> it<00:00:27.090> seem<00:00:27.300> a<00:00:27.330> little<00:00:27.630> better<00:00:29.240> and<00:00:30.950> show

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:31.950 
make it seem a little better and show

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:34.009 
make it seem a little better and show
too<00:00:32.189> we<00:00:32.519> did<00:00:32.699> it<00:00:32.850> somewhat<00:00:33.480> differently

00:00:34.009 --> 00:00:34.019 
too we did it somewhat differently

00:00:34.019 --> 00:00:36.590 
too we did it somewhat differently
because<00:00:34.649> we<00:00:35.070> filmed<00:00:35.519> that<00:00:35.550> only<00:00:35.850> 50<00:00:36.359> frames

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
because we filmed that only 50 frames

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.720 
because we filmed that only 50 frames
per<00:00:36.839> second<00:00:37.289> we<00:00:37.649> couldn't<00:00:38.039> do<00:00:38.160> the<00:00:38.280> same<00:00:38.519> with

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
per second we couldn't do the same with

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.569 
per second we couldn't do the same with
the<00:00:38.850> ball<00:00:39.030> so<00:00:39.749> what<00:00:39.899> we<00:00:40.079> did<00:00:40.260> we<00:00:40.920> just<00:00:41.100> feel<00:00:41.309> me

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
the ball so what we did we just feel me

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.069 
the ball so what we did we just feel me
standing<00:00:42.089> there<00:00:42.120> with<00:00:42.449> the<00:00:42.570> ball<00:00:42.719> and<00:00:42.960> I'm

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
standing there with the ball and I'm

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.099 
standing there with the ball and I'm
asked<00:00:43.320> the<00:00:43.559> ball<00:00:43.999> then<00:00:44.999> I<00:00:45.030> animated<00:00:45.749> in<00:00:45.870> time

00:00:46.099 --> 00:00:46.109 
asked the ball then I animated in time

00:00:46.109 --> 00:00:49.189 
asked the ball then I animated in time
above<00:00:46.559> my<00:00:46.739> friends<00:00:47.100> head<00:00:47.309> I<00:00:47.960> didn't<00:00:48.960> have<00:00:49.050> to

00:00:49.189 --> 00:00:49.199 
above my friends head I didn't have to

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:51.139 
above my friends head I didn't have to
do<00:00:49.379> any<00:00:49.710> color<00:00:50.190> matching<00:00:50.699> or<00:00:50.850> whatever

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
do any color matching or whatever

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:52.790 
do any color matching or whatever
because<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:51.749> ball<00:00:51.929> was<00:00:51.960> already<00:00:52.530> in<00:00:52.739> the

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
because the ball was already in the

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.549 
because the ball was already in the
right<00:00:53.010> place<00:00:53.309> I<00:00:53.640> only<00:00:54.449> had<00:00:54.749> to<00:00:54.899> get<00:00:55.019> rid<00:00:55.230> of<00:00:55.289> the

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
right place I only had to get rid of the

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.579 
right place I only had to get rid of the
shadow<00:00:55.829> of<00:00:55.980> my<00:00:56.190> hand<00:00:56.429> holding<00:00:56.760> the<00:00:56.819> ball<00:00:57.059> in

00:00:57.579 --> 00:00:57.589 
shadow of my hand holding the ball in

00:00:57.589 --> 00:01:00.529 
shadow of my hand holding the ball in
the<00:00:58.589> end<00:00:58.739> I<00:00:58.949> just<00:00:59.219> added<00:00:59.460> some<00:00:59.579> motion<00:01:00.089> blur<00:01:00.300> to

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
the end I just added some motion blur to

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:05.630 
the end I just added some motion blur to
make<00:01:00.719> it<00:01:00.870> blend<00:01:01.050> better<00:01:04.100> shield<00:01:05.100> three<00:01:05.430> is

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
make it blend better shield three is

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.490 
make it blend better shield three is
based<00:01:05.910> on<00:01:06.060> exactly<00:01:06.510> the<00:01:06.690> same<00:01:06.900> techniques<00:01:07.350> a

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
based on exactly the same techniques a

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.440 
based on exactly the same techniques a
shot<00:01:07.770> one<00:01:08.010> shot<00:01:08.270> for<00:01:09.270> and<00:01:09.860> shot<00:01:10.860> five<00:01:11.160> our<00:01:11.670> base

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
shot one shot for and shot five our base

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.280 
shot one shot for and shot five our base
on<00:01:12.750> the<00:01:12.840> same<00:01:13.080> techniques<00:01:13.500> a<00:01:13.680> shot<00:01:13.950> two<00:01:14.220> in<00:01:15.290> the

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
on the same techniques a shot two in the

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.410 
on the same techniques a shot two in the
last<00:01:16.500> shot<00:01:16.770> we<00:01:17.010> did<00:01:17.160> something<00:01:17.460> a<00:01:17.940> little<00:01:18.120> bit

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
last shot we did something a little bit

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.840 
last shot we did something a little bit
different<00:01:19.050> I<00:01:19.260> just<00:01:19.890> throw<00:01:20.220> the<00:01:20.400> ball<00:01:20.580> and<00:01:20.700> he

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
different I just throw the ball and he

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.330 
different I just throw the ball and he
saves<00:01:21.150> it<00:01:21.390> then<00:01:22.020> a<00:01:22.050> monster<00:01:22.590> ball<00:01:22.740> just<00:01:23.190> before

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
saves it then a monster ball just before

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.150 
saves it then a monster ball just before
he<00:01:23.640> called<00:01:23.910> it<00:01:24.090> I<00:01:24.270> froze<00:01:25.170> his<00:01:25.440> frame<00:01:25.710> and<00:01:25.980> made

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:26.160 
he called it I froze his frame and made

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.100 
he called it I froze his frame and made
it<00:01:26.280> as<00:01:26.430> long<00:01:26.730> as<00:01:26.940> the<00:01:27.090> start<00:01:27.420> of<00:01:27.570> the<00:01:27.600> comb<00:01:27.900> to

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
it as long as the start of the comb to

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.920 
it as long as the start of the comb to
the<00:01:28.230> moment<00:01:28.590> he<00:01:28.680> catches<00:01:29.160> the<00:01:29.190> ball<00:01:29.310> I<00:01:29.700> got<00:01:30.690> rid

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
the moment he catches the ball I got rid

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.720 
the moment he catches the ball I got rid
of<00:01:30.960> the<00:01:31.200> original<00:01:31.620> ball<00:01:31.770> in<00:01:31.920> my<00:01:32.040> hand<00:01:32.280> just

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:32.730 
of the original ball in my hand just

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:35.030 
of the original ball in my hand just
before<00:01:32.910> you<00:01:33.150> see<00:01:33.480> death<00:01:33.720> frame<00:01:34.020> so<00:01:34.560> the<00:01:34.590> only

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
before you see death frame so the only

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.890 
before you see death frame so the only
ball<00:01:35.220> you<00:01:35.370> see<00:01:35.640> is<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:35.880> frozen<00:01:36.480> ball<00:01:36.630> at<00:01:36.810> the

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
ball you see is the frozen ball at the

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.500 
ball you see is the frozen ball at the
place<00:01:37.140> where<00:01:37.440> he<00:01:37.620> will<00:01:37.740> catch<00:01:37.980> it<00:01:38.250> I<00:01:38.510> just

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:39.510 
place where he will catch it I just

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:41.600 
place where he will catch it I just
animated<00:01:40.110> the<00:01:40.410> scale<00:01:40.740> position<00:01:41.280> and<00:01:41.430> rotation

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
animated the scale position and rotation

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.730 
animated the scale position and rotation
of<00:01:42.090> the<00:01:42.180> frozen<00:01:42.360> ball<00:01:42.720> so<00:01:43.020> it<00:01:43.050> looks<00:01:43.320> like<00:01:43.530> it's

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
of the frozen ball so it looks like it's

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.360 
of the frozen ball so it looks like it's
floating<00:01:44.040> to<00:01:44.370> the<00:01:44.400> goal<00:01:45.650> that's<00:01:46.650> it<00:01:46.890> i<00:01:47.040> think

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:47.370 
floating to the goal that's it i think

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:50.210 
floating to the goal that's it i think
if<00:01:48.060> you<00:01:48.270> got<00:01:48.450> any<00:01:48.690> questions<00:01:48.810> to<00:01:49.740> put<00:01:49.920> them<00:01:50.100> in

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
if you got any questions to put them in
