 fishing like a little boat and let's go 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:21.930
 behind a fish that is extremely 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.250
 but that attracts a lot of people to 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.470
 to fish here in argentina 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.799
 you do not see a fishery of piapara and 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.930

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.439

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:50.700
 Come on, people stay in the water. 

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:54.600
 O 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.409
 here you loose pretty clean 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:26.090
 This lock starts to sink and that's where the 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.090
 We 'll find the gold 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:55.150
 i due uses and this fox girls do not talk about 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:55.150
 the whole line 

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:14.959
 Look there and it's far away and it took 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:17.800
 lots of line the fish did not jump 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:17.800
 still jet 

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:33.719
 The fantastic thing is, what 's this? 

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:47.920
 This is going to be great big big 

00:03:45.609 --> 00:04:03.180
 The way he hit the bait he left taking 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:04:03.180
 and talking to you in the background is still ours. 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:14.469
 How come we do not know how you 're hooked? 

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:17.139
 this gold fishery is something that 

00:04:14.469 --> 00:04:22.109
 you have to do is keep the vacancy 

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:22.109
 always intentional but very much 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:25.150
 Sometimes the fish swims toward the 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:26.860
 boat 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:32.289
 You have to raise your hand to 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:34.509
 collect that sometimes he is alone with the 

00:04:32.289 --> 00:04:44.550
 bait in the mouth if you take a break in the 

00:04:34.509 --> 00:04:44.550
 fish line has not jumped yet 

00:04:49.009 --> 00:05:06.710
 our the far far away from becoming a 

00:04:55.789 --> 00:05:20.330
 little attack on the arm can not handle this 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:28.629
 that he ox or there and worshiped us not 

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:33.139
 it's big do not let it hit and the bait's got 

00:05:28.629 --> 00:05:44.719
 in the middle of it why it took so much 

00:05:33.139 --> 00:05:53.389
 lines and andrade a little noticed him 

00:05:44.719 --> 00:05:55.639
 work was worth the excitement at the time you 

00:05:53.389 --> 00:05:57.439
 That's why he got angry. 

00:05:55.639 --> 00:06:02.389
 to see each other 

00:05:57.439 --> 00:06:06.969
 took not jumped there took back 

00:06:02.389 --> 00:06:06.969
 How big is he going to go wherever he wants 

00:06:11.259 --> 00:06:21.519
 there still wild fish shows know where 

00:06:18.769 --> 00:06:21.519
 dude here 

00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:57.250
 This is how it's easier now 

00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:58.480
 already let go of this ladder we do not know 

00:06:57.250 --> 00:07:04.330
 hurt 

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:07.140
 then people are more in gold than 

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:07.140
 a race 

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:12.790
 I thought this was one of those great 

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:18.520
 great of 1518 that so much that he took 

00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:19.900
 of line but then the beat box caught 

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:24.300
 on body 

00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:24.300
 and then we become really passenger 

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:48.600
 though and it is male and if you have too much 

00:07:32.530 --> 00:07:48.600
 to grow though and ready 

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:59.710
 We like to sit there and 

00:07:57.430 --> 00:08:02.170
 people will leave for the break but it's a 

00:07:59.710 --> 00:08:04.680
 quickly quickly after a while we 

00:08:02.170 --> 00:08:04.680
 we're back
