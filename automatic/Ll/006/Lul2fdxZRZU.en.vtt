Hasbro<00:01:14.460> has<00:01:14.580> developed<00:01:15.000> this<00:01:15.090> the<00:01:15.540> sculpt<00:01:16.110> of

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
Hasbro has developed this the sculpt of

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.350 
Hasbro has developed this the sculpt of
this<00:01:16.560> figure<00:01:17.009> the<00:01:17.310> colour<00:01:17.549> scheme<00:01:17.909> I<00:01:18.150> actually

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
this figure the colour scheme I actually

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.740 
this figure the colour scheme I actually
like<00:01:18.960> this<00:01:19.409> one<00:01:19.650> this<00:01:19.890> figure<00:01:20.220> very<00:01:20.460> much<00:01:20.750> the

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
like this one this figure very much the

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.700 
like this one this figure very much the
only<00:01:21.869> problem<00:01:22.439> I<00:01:22.530> have<00:01:22.680> with<00:01:22.799> it<00:01:22.860> is<00:01:23.630> you'll

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:24.710 
only problem I have with it is you'll

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:26.960 
only problem I have with it is you'll
since<00:01:25.710> they're<00:01:25.860> short<00:01:26.130> packed<00:01:26.400> there's<00:01:26.820> only

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
since they're short packed there's only

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.620 
since they're short packed there's only
one<00:01:27.270> per<00:01:27.900> case<00:01:28.140> of<00:01:28.320> 12<00:01:29.000> it's<00:01:30.000> very<00:01:30.210> difficult

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
one per case of 12 it's very difficult

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.870 
one per case of 12 it's very difficult
to<00:01:30.780> find<00:01:30.960> one<00:01:31.320> with<00:01:31.710> really<00:01:32.490> really

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
to find one with really really

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.300 
to find one with really really
near-perfect<00:01:33.479> pane<00:01:33.960> apps<00:01:34.200> you'll<00:01:34.950> have<00:01:35.070> to<00:01:35.220> go

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
near-perfect pane apps you'll have to go

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.429 
near-perfect pane apps you'll have to go
through<00:01:35.490> several<00:01:35.729> stores<00:01:36.240> or<00:01:36.720> if<00:01:37.290> you're

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
through several stores or if you're

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.260 
through several stores or if you're
lucky<00:01:37.650> you<00:01:37.979> can<00:01:38.009> go<00:01:38.250> to<00:01:38.340> a<00:01:38.430> big<00:01:38.670> store<00:01:38.820> that<00:01:39.180> has

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
lucky you can go to a big store that has

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.730 
lucky you can go to a big store that has
a<00:01:39.299> lot<00:01:39.600> of<00:01:39.630> these<00:01:39.840> figures<00:01:40.079> and<00:01:40.350> really<00:01:40.530> search

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
a lot of these figures and really search

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.880 
a lot of these figures and really search
through<00:01:41.009> the<00:01:41.189> pegs<00:01:41.820> and<00:01:42.180> then<00:01:42.930> find<00:01:43.350> one<00:01:43.590> with

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
through the pegs and then find one with

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.620 
through the pegs and then find one with
very<00:01:44.640> good<00:01:45.030> decent<00:01:45.270> pane<00:01:45.689> apps<00:01:47.329> which<00:01:48.329> is<00:01:48.450> very

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
very good decent pane apps which is very

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:49.520 
very good decent pane apps which is very
difficult<00:01:48.960> to<00:01:49.079> do<00:01:49.170> because<00:01:49.290> a<00:01:49.380> lot<00:01:49.500> of

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
difficult to do because a lot of

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.679

World<00:05:01.440> War<00:05:01.500> two<00:05:02.040> I<00:05:02.700> forgot<00:05:03.390> what<00:05:03.540> it's<00:05:03.690> called

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:03.960 
World War two I forgot what it's called

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:09.050 
World War two I forgot what it's called
but<00:05:04.740> it's<00:05:05.720> very<00:05:06.720> classic<00:05:07.080> red<00:05:07.440> skull<00:05:07.940> the<00:05:08.940> way

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:09.060 
but it's very classic red skull the way

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:11.680 
but it's very classic red skull the way
they've<00:05:09.240> had<00:05:09.450> the<00:05:09.750> way<00:05:09.870> they've<00:05:10.020> sculpted<00:05:10.500> it

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:11.690 
they've had the way they've sculpted it

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:13.730 
they've had the way they've sculpted it
perhaps<00:05:12.690> the<00:05:12.930> barrel<00:05:13.320> should<00:05:13.530> have<00:05:13.620> been<00:05:13.710> a

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:13.740 
perhaps the barrel should have been a

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:15.350 
perhaps the barrel should have been a
little<00:05:13.920> bit<00:05:14.010> thinner<00:05:14.220> but<00:05:14.490> yeah<00:05:15.060> I<00:05:15.120> like<00:05:15.300> it

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:15.360

I<00:06:49.139> think<00:06:50.139> this<00:06:50.289> I'm<00:06:50.530> not<00:06:50.740> sure<00:06:50.800> and<00:06:51.400> don't<00:06:51.819> read

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:52.030 
I think this I'm not sure and don't read

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:53.580 
I think this I'm not sure and don't read
a<00:06:52.060> lot<00:06:52.270> of<00:06:52.360> Captain<00:06:52.629> America<00:06:52.990> comic<00:06:53.289> books<00:06:53.469> I

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:53.590 
a lot of Captain America comic books I

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:55.679 
a lot of Captain America comic books I
think<00:06:53.620> this<00:06:53.979> one<00:06:54.189> is<00:06:54.310> a<00:06:54.340> lot<00:06:54.490> closer<00:06:54.789> to<00:06:55.509> how<00:06:55.629> we

00:06:55.679 --> 00:06:55.689 
think this one is a lot closer to how we

00:06:55.689 --> 00:06:58.020 
think this one is a lot closer to how we
look<00:06:55.900> like<00:06:56.110> in<00:06:56.259> the<00:06:56.319> comic<00:06:56.710> books<00:06:56.949> and<00:06:57.250> I

00:06:58.020 --> 00:06:58.030 
look like in the comic books and I

00:06:58.030 --> 00:07:00.839 
look like in the comic books and I
