00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:09.990
 the minutes is a complete broth 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:13.080
 I would like to try up to you roughly 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:16.560
 a neighbor of launcher between free of a 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:20.180
 payment while I open them ridiculous which one 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:22.820
 version this is for asus nexus 7 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:27.510
 this particular version of android 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:32.130
 does not allow need in mode 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:35.040
 landscape but only in portrait mode a 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.950
 exception from opening applications 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:41.010
 games etc. 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:43.050
 moreover humidity I can block the 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:47.789
 rotation unlock it click this 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:52.289
 icon present in the drop-down menu concerning the 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:56.190
 stock rom version is basically google 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:59.609
 albeit clean fast experience at a 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:02.940
 firmware here no manufacturer put 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:06.000
 hands let's try an ex launcher 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.439
 this is a former course over two hours e 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.220
 half 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:13.770
 there is also a free version with 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:17.430
 always the possibility of applying themes 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:21.960
 and small changes very very complete 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:24.750
 also this one I show you for 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:28.799
 example settings 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:30.869
 there are lots of sub windows of 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:36.409
 menu etc. and so on 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:36.409
 however it is very linked to honeycomb 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:45.020
 applications are presented in 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:49.649
 this way therefore also seen the effect 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:51.990
 appearance and disappearance method for 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:53.820
 add shortcuts widgets and so on 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:02:01.799
 that the old way click on 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:02:04.950
 screen and landscape mode widget that 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:05.610
 ex adv launcher works without any 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.420
 problem 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:14.190
 two step apex launcher and let's get started 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:17.720
 even here icons have been since then 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:20.940
 slightly larger than adv 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:25.230
 how to open the anchor 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:28.350
 honeycomb style, however, we have three sections 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:31.800
 sincerely the utility of downloaded is 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:33.480
 questionable however they come 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:37.860
 practically re - presented with the addition 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:43.620
 of someone who might not be seen 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:46.170
 in the menu otherwise we see big launcher 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:48.350
 this is the full version a 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.350
 payment 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:56.970
 do not deceive yourself despite being 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:03:00.870
 submitted any with a cornet for 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:05.700
 the telephone and then text messages 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:08.190
 it doesn't work I loved that 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:11.730
 actually opening the camera 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:14.100
 manages to recognize that facing the 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:18.390
 gallery has created problems for me like 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:21.450
 this is the idea of ​​this moment sos do 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:22.680
 starting a call or message but 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:24.060
 we are headed 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.910
 since this terminal cannot 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:29.790
 send him this instead the screen with 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:33.590
 the applications are presented in this 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:36.329
 so I don't know if you remember go launcher ex 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:40.370
 and I would say he has an application he has 

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:40.370
 need very few presentations 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:47.120
 this is the tablet version 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:57.299
 size of discrete cones and come 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:59.450
 all customized see for example 

00:03:57.299 --> 00:03:59.450
 twitter 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:02.660
 we see 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:16.790
 bets little on the shutter speed between 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:22.460
 one window of the other but this a 

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:27.229
 advantage of clear presentation 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:34.250
 in widget applications we will have to 

00:04:27.229 --> 00:04:37.610
 still go to this rich screen 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:40.850
 on the screen etc. from here we can 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:44.690
 also manage the themes the mode of 

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:47.150
 lockscreen and any effects of 

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:52.070
 transition between one window and another 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:58.720
 the cs 4.0 launcher size of the icons 

00:04:52.070 --> 00:05:03.500
 very limited presentation in the table 

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:07.700
 4x4 maybe a little bit bigger 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:10.850
 it would all benefit screeners 

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:14.810
 I cannot separate but very clear 

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:18.860
 move me see to top widget 

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:22.130
 I have to go to click by clicking the 

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:25.250
 menu button I can change small 

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:28.340
 graphic aspects and access to 

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:32.060
 settings of both the ance and the 

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:38.150
 system by a limina challenger 4.1 

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:47.090
 free apparently very tied to 

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:52.300
 that of the previous dubber 4x4 lo 

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:56.510
 same for the widgets I expect nov ha 

00:05:52.300 --> 00:06:00.770
 immediately intrigued by this icon mi 

00:05:56.510 --> 00:06:03.229
 opening a single shot google now good 

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:04.160
 now that in a video just before 

00:06:03.229 --> 00:06:08.030
 in the canal 

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:10.550
 I compared siri on ios 6 if you 

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:11.960
 like as an argument, take a ride 

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:15.010
 let's see this the mode of 

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:15.010
 default transition 

00:06:17.229 --> 00:06:25.550
 rao pocket is particular as it does not go 

00:06:22.639 --> 00:06:30.229
 to open a real veil spear 

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:33.159
 video reviewed in the channel so 

00:06:30.229 --> 00:06:39.919
 thorough because it really is 

00:06:33.159 --> 00:06:43.009
 this particular the free version 

00:06:39.919 --> 00:06:46.719
 I also bought the complete one 

00:06:43.009 --> 00:06:52.069
 find the video review of that 

00:06:46.719 --> 00:06:57.909
 complete with recent apps that also 

00:06:52.069 --> 00:07:01.099
 I would see it this way and here too 

00:06:57.909 --> 00:07:03.289
 add more shortcuts because 

00:07:01.099 --> 00:07:06.229
 to hundreds and hundreds of ex is 

00:07:03.289 --> 00:07:12.050
 really convenient not discharged 

00:07:06.229 --> 00:07:14.719
 we also see this overlap 

00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:17.949
 a lancer default in fact now we have 

00:07:14.719 --> 00:07:25.490
 Active rauche pockets at this icon 

00:07:17.949 --> 00:07:31.219
 green on the left these icons from 

00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:33.559
 frame to the screen and then lancer then from 

00:07:31.219 --> 00:07:40.669
 a cerche allows to create 

00:07:33.559 --> 00:07:43.719
 customize a honda we say red and 

00:07:40.669 --> 00:07:48.979
 this is wave launcher 

00:07:43.719 --> 00:07:51.619
 I really talked a lot for 

00:07:48.979 --> 00:07:53.029
 any curiosity question to do two 

00:07:51.619 --> 00:07:56.829
 chat leave a comment e 

00:07:53.029 --> 00:07:56.829
