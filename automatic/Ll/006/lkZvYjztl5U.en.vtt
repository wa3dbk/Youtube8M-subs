00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:12.440
 Nine people, I'm there, we're all stuck 

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:15.260
 new video channel and in the city there was 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:17.570
 again a few quick updates and these 

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:19.940
 when I look at a bit of me today 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:22.070
 an apples platform or too german 

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:24.680
 of course, flood plain and there they have 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:26.450
 just in the completely new construction 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:27.950
 asked that is the map begins 

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:30.290
 this time from the other side there 

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:33.140
 where normally the last one 

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:35.239
 bases of the page starts is now so 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.710
 not as we know this park 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:40.670
 section as seen but directly 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:42.800
 within the city calls it at it 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:44.989
 there are no more battle pickups or 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:47.030
 that is really not in vacha only 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:50.030
 my jeeps there is really nothing 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:51.829
 the more he heliad he all away to then 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:53.569
 no parachute spawn anymore 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:56.179
 the spark so you really come 

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:57.890
 So I can not stand up anymore 

00:00:56.179 --> 00:01:01.639
 water through these whole roofs 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:03.829
 this including the fighting pub in the 

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:04.879
 sense already prevents it from becoming 

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:06.080
 evolution no longer automatic 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:09.170
 activated but only from the third 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.880
 base you can destroy this wall 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:12.580
 but still flood if you can do it in 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:15.500
 the short time around who does that 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:17.300
 probably happens to all but quite so 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.980
 make the idea completely new with these 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.240
 and the infantry only I think so 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:23.990
 actually very cool 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:26.660
 only the implementation is not so 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:29.330
 my first the defenders 

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:32.630
 Some people can just come along perfectly 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:35.210
 comb in base 1 when I attack 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.560
 we have outside zones m coming and jena 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:37.820
 You can park directly from the car park 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.420
 different they may once again 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:39.860
 fade in 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.690
 I'm really mega I purely 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:43.850
 I ran and washed 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:46.160
 Michael Ballack wanted it and he could 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:47.840
 Well, now you can see it's easy 

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:49.580
 down ball to another scene 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.530
 Here I have such an increase was 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:53.180
 must be directly can not rise 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:55.250
 out the window springer from the roof 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:58.480
 or I can jump on it 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:01.280
 loose opponents from above to shoot down 

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:02.280
 of course this is all now not sooo 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.140
 hot 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.729
 The network area is also still outside 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.440
 The bridge continues where you stop too 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:09.630
 back up and sometimes even 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:12.209
 through this super cover and this 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:13.980
 raising extreme benefits had become 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:16.050
 with the mg something similar to what was just there 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.970
 of course that's all 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:19.230
 difficult the map is finished map is there 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.900
 I can really map easy 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:23.550
 completely rebuild but there are 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.410
 just synonymous problems with the now 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:26.880
 not a completely new design 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:29.340
 necessarily fit but should be easy 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:31.680
 really big changes some 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:34.920
 perform areas and therefore fits 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:36.590
 not all that perfect otherwise 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.880
 it may still be watery 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.680
 had lead Revival trouble 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.120
 not so often now but somehow 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.730
 so it is not so rwe me this 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:47.640
 I have to say that I have to drive up to the base 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.870
 So, or rather the radstation 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.510
 themselves are a bit short 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.340
 You actually only have three pieces in this way 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:54.450
 it can sometimes really small intervals 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:58.410
 go fast 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:03:00.780
 let's see sometimes he almost gives it 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:02.040
 already such a cluster fact is already 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:05.730
 a little longer you will take back window 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:07.640
 station they meant bissingen short and 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:09.720
 Well , that's just not perfect 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:11.970
 on to the next card, too 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:15.870
 that was of course adapted to golmud 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:17.610
 railway or golmud railway and there 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:18.870
 I can not say that much now because 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:20.220
 the rounds were always cut off 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.090
 and the problem is you can do the maps like that 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.280
 bad test 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:25.320
 there are just a few servers or 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.610
 Run all maps one after the other through the 

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:29.850
 means I played well then may 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:30.450
 I place 1 2 round 2 round 2 round 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:31.650
 etc 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:32.850
 May I really have several websites 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:35.880
 preliminary round play until I back 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:38.430
 if everlasting looks golmud always has 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:39.900
 what bad company 2 just because of 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:41.519
 this whole building really does 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:43.980
 Break that is really one of those 

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:46.739
 the few sections photo times a bit 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:49.200
 said it better can the breaks go 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:52.260
 broken and that too has here otherwise 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:54.060
 it often so that a wall is busted 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.769
 I do not know you have to try and 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:59.130
 here really goes much broken las hab 

00:03:55.769 --> 00:04:00.750
 already so easy bad company 2 feeling 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:03.450
 Still, she is not as good as 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:06.060
 the webs of that time with a bit 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:08.220
 redistributed among the vehicles now 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:10.200
 These trucks do not care anymore 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:12.120
 It's about the tank at the first 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:13.090
 base the attackers have two tanks of the 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:15.459
 Defender has 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:17.169
 have a new second base the 

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:17.889
 attackers still have one and defenders 

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:20.139
 certainly no more 

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:22.540
 with the third fourth fifth is halt 

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:24.310
 infantry only here we just see x5 

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:27.430
 bases and in place and there are 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:29.080
 only three without bad and there can 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:30.940
 it also cause problems because if 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:32.650
 I attack both create armor 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:36.040
 to get through the first base 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:37.570
 yes then you have essay then I have 

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:39.729
 already experienced that on the last base 

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:41.290
 at the fifth still both opponents 

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:44.169
 already tanks were there and it has 

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:45.780
 partly overrun that works 

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:49.270
 not quite as good as these are 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:51.280
 stationary rocket launcher but unfortunately 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:53.139
 sometimes they can not do that either 

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:55.389
 purpose and especially if it is 

00:04:53.139 --> 00:04:58.510
 actually means riol ii will be the 

00:04:55.389 --> 00:05:01.150
 Pioneers less and less and when he does 

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:02.440
 can do something against the panzer yes 

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:04.630
 then they are pretty bad 

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:06.520
 of course you have the same design 

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:07.960
 small changes carried out at the 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:09.460
 Coverings that was yes she was 

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:10.270
 every card somehow has to be better 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:11.919
 hinzubekommen 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:14.470
 but have it easy with me 

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:15.340
 always become the aggressor I have 

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:16.570
 until now there was not that 

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:18.100
 defenders have won every time 

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:18.729
 are the attackers still somehow 

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:20.020
 passed through 

00:05:18.729 --> 00:05:22.780
 now they also have to pay ticket 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:25.570
 By default, 100 changes what I do 

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:27.010
 Now do not hold so well until now 

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:30.039
 so currently cost that the 

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:32.110
 Attacker crass on the winner so the 

00:05:30.039 --> 00:05:33.430
 other the attackers a round where the 

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:34.570
 be swapped teams winning back the 

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:36.910
 probably the attacker probably before 

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:38.320
 totally get downed only comes 

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:40.930
 with just as if the 

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:44.169
 attacker with many maps in the advantage 

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:46.660
 There would be something to the visual recoil 

00:05:44.169 --> 00:05:48.760
 who is already gefixed have you 

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:50.470
 tells all weapons are affected in the 

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:53.139
 main game is not yet the case and 

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:55.840
 I just think the burst weapons take 

00:05:53.139 --> 00:05:56.979
 I once tested the m4 here 

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:58.960
 much better 

00:05:56.979 --> 00:06:00.940
 so clear up again so far 

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:02.200
 but I find just at the markets 

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:04.360
 One more piece I can do with him 

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:05.919
 start a bit more than before 

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:07.000
 I still have to say burst weapons 

00:06:05.919 --> 00:06:08.289
 are not mine is not mine 

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.060
 I'm feeling the exchanges rather 

00:06:08.289 --> 00:06:12.580
 I would like to have the left myself 

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:15.310
 but did not specify on the weapon 

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:16.990
 I have to say she played well 

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:19.120
 as was not bad i could 

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:20.560
 use and that's nice 

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:23.060
 I think the exchanges need it then 

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:25.130
 again so know the coup 

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:27.350
 how much to me, for example, in the 43rd 

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:29.780
 the poor 490 nothing to say that was 

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:31.100
 a sick beast and the kh has become 

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:32.450
 I also have to say that it feels good 

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:35.720
 I liked these two for example 

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:39.889
 better than in comparison to the four 

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:41.630
 first weapons so that's it with this 

00:06:39.889 --> 00:06:43.430
 I do not know what I will do next 

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:45.560
 days so makes because from tuesday comes yes 

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:48.169
 such a dlc i have heard brands deep 

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:49.910
 that's exactly what it was and there you will become 

00:06:48.169 --> 00:06:51.919
 also to give a few videos 

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:53.750
 Because there would be very high in any case 

00:06:51.919 --> 00:06:56.260
 cool see you next time 

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:56.260
 pure skin
