00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:07.540
 they take advantage of our presence on the lounge energy wood in besançon 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:09.760
 to represent a little bit 

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:13.049
 our product mass stove in the 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:16.049
 compared to the situation that makes 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.670
 2012 we will see a new thermal regulation that will 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:23.800
 which is modeled on the thermal regulations rt 2005 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.789
 bbc version 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:29.349
 so what is it worth today compared to love yourself and stopped her news 

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:31.390
 house configuration with them 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:32.680
 few of 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:36.130
 of loss of berre a great tightness of the houses 

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:38.090
 p insulation 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:41.650
 much more important way to approach a house much less 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:42.960
 inefficient 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.580
 it raises the issue of wood heating compared to 

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:48.940
 in some cases too much power 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:51.410
 or weights the restitution of instant flavors 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:54.830
 that will cause more heat pics 

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:56.520
 which can be uncomfortable 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.320
 call an overheating by low house builders 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:00.790
 consumption 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:02.390
 % and today 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:04.590
 classic hair as we know it 

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:07.160
 the red one instantly the power 

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:09.060
 fire that we do inside 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.290
 that is to say, a hair 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:14.479
 one that currently works as we know it 

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:17.850
 % 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.650
 a consumption of wood that is about two kilos of wood per hour 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:24.960
 in relation to the strength of the wood and the performance of the hair 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.030
 that gives us about 6 kilowatts 2 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:28.960
 power 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:30.830
 located to the actors 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:33.100
 in e2 power restored 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.550
 the problem is that these web sites usually in these homes 

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:40.159
 the assumption of the year a very very big house we do not need it 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:41.770
 needs a lot less 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:44.030
 maybe one or two kilos drummer of 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:45.000
 power 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.190
 then the the the answer to this problem 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:52.210
 for 100 e as far as we are concerned compared to mass p peaters the big 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:53.640
 hair capacity 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.240
 to store the heat and therefore absorbed at first 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:00.360
 the heat that is produced by burning 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:05.050
 to restore it gradually and therefore very slowly by radiation to 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:06.760
 hourly 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:09.559
 compared to that 

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:12.019
 the tully brand that lives and that I represent 

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:16.659
 to ferhat concept of hairs that fit very very well aof collecting 

00:02:16.659 --> 00:02:18.839
 new demand for these new needs 

00:02:18.839 --> 00:02:22.489
 we have with hair that is made with a double envelope is like if we 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:25.579
 had closed again to a mass stove in his second pole of the 

00:02:25.579 --> 00:02:25.969
 season 

00:02:25.969 --> 00:02:28.059
 so we have two layers of stone 

00:02:28.059 --> 00:02:31.540
 which will allow a greater accumulation and diffusion of heat 

00:02:31.539 --> 00:02:33.909
 even slower 

00:02:33.909 --> 00:02:36.309
 with this principle rhôna 

00:02:36.309 --> 00:02:39.629
 for very very isolated houses see the house that will get closer 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:44.039
 since we know that in 2020 we will go to the passive house 

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:49.510
 there is also the possibility of such a process to an isolation between the two 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:50.600
 states on stone 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.499
 in order to keep the heat takes longer 

00:02:53.499 --> 00:02:55.979
 and spread it even more slowly 

00:02:55.979 --> 00:02:59.229
 the peculiarity of our hair and to restore the heat by radiation 

00:02:59.229 --> 00:03:00.399
 infrared 

00:03:00.399 --> 00:03:03.949
 so that rona walls of houses that are heated by the 

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:06.479
 infrared radiation of the hair of this fact 

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:09.869
 the heat demand and a little bit less 

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:13.660
 the the principle of infrared radiation 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:16.540
 we still have an infrared ray emitter which is the mass stove 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:19.540
 and we have in its environment receivers 

00:03:20.169 --> 00:03:24.299
 the receptors months they are claiming months the mass stove will be discharging 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:25.499
 quickly 

00:03:25.499 --> 00:03:28.830
 so that the product mass stove is quite suitable 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:30.989
 at home low consumption 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:32.309
 Furthermore 

00:03:32.309 --> 00:03:35.419
 from 2012 we will have a system 

00:03:35.419 --> 00:03:39.230
 of the system it is necessary to roll which will be able quest to insert 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:42.079
 between the two stone walls I mentioned earlier 

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:44.689
 which will allow to have in some cases 

00:03:44.689 --> 00:03:47.819
 three energies for home solar panels 

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:48.999
 couple 

00:03:48.999 --> 00:03:51.879
 in the hair cully who lives with an op 

00:03:51.879 --> 00:03:54.709
 a third energy that will be the energetic voice 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:58.079
 choose another customer and thereby cultivate it 

00:03:58.079 --> 00:03:59.939
 we will be able to 

00:03:59.939 --> 00:04:00.989
 mix 

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:03.599
 solar heat heat wood 

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:07.099
 heat its sanitary water and to distribute this heat throughout the 

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:07.660
 House 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:09.629
 through floor heating 

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:11.719
 parra 

00:04:11.719 --> 00:04:13.919
 there how the circulation of hot water in soils
