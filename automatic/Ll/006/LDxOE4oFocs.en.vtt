that<00:00:09.120> now<00:00:10.080> this<00:00:10.349> is<00:00:10.530> the<00:00:10.650> room<00:00:10.889> you<00:00:11.280> just<00:00:11.580> like

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
that now this is the room you just like

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.999 
that now this is the room you just like
the<00:00:11.910> spacers<00:00:12.330> and<00:00:12.719> once<00:00:13.320> you<00:00:13.440> come<00:00:13.650> in<00:00:13.769> here

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
the spacers and once you come in here

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:15.919 
the spacers and once you come in here
there's<00:00:14.519> no<00:00:14.670> oxygen<00:00:14.849> you<00:00:15.389> got<00:00:15.509> to<00:00:15.630> kill<00:00:15.780> these

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
there's no oxygen you got to kill these

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.080 
there's no oxygen you got to kill these
guys<00:00:15.990> they<00:00:16.980> get<00:00:17.369> into<00:00:17.490> the<00:00:17.730> brain<00:00:17.910> you

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
guys they get into the brain you

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.060 
guys they get into the brain you
actually<00:00:18.270> have<00:00:18.570> to<00:00:18.720> be<00:00:18.869> in<00:00:19.080> and<00:00:19.380> all<00:00:19.920> this

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
actually have to be in and all this

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.609 
actually have to be in and all this
happens<00:00:20.130> in<00:00:20.699> Chapter<00:00:21.090> seven<00:00:21.480> so<00:00:22.080> it's<00:00:22.260> after

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
happens in Chapter seven so it's after

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.710 
happens in Chapter seven so it's after
the<00:00:22.650> elevator<00:00:23.130> part<00:00:23.460> and<00:00:24.090> I<00:00:24.420> think<00:00:24.600> it's

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
the elevator part and I think it's

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.529 
the elevator part and I think it's
before<00:00:25.080> the<00:00:25.140> solar<00:00:25.619> panel<00:00:26.160> board<00:00:26.400> so<00:00:27.330> it's

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
before the solar panel board so it's

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.300 
before the solar panel board so it's
right<00:00:27.750> in<00:00:27.930> between<00:00:28.080> there<00:00:28.500> and<00:00:28.830> what<00:00:29.160> you're

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
right in between there and what you're

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.370 
right in between there and what you're
supposed<00:00:29.640> to<00:00:29.730> do<00:00:29.880> is<00:00:30.119> go<00:00:30.390> in<00:00:30.599> and<00:00:30.630> fix<00:00:30.990> all<00:00:31.170> the

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
supposed to do is go in and fix all the

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.180 
supposed to do is go in and fix all the
fuses<00:00:31.769> and<00:00:31.800> then<00:00:32.279> destroy<00:00:33.120> them<00:00:33.620> so<00:00:34.620> this<00:00:34.980> is<00:00:35.010> a

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
fuses and then destroy them so this is a

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.060 
fuses and then destroy them so this is a
what<00:00:36.090> happens<00:00:36.420> a<00:00:36.510> little<00:00:36.570> bit<00:00:36.809> before<00:00:36.960> that

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:40.070 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:42.319 

but<00:00:41.070> once<00:00:41.219> me<00:00:41.399> like<00:00:41.579> this<00:00:41.760> we're<00:00:42.030> going<00:00:42.120> to<00:00:42.180> be

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
but once me like this we're going to be

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.000 
but once me like this we're going to be
in<00:00:42.420> the<00:00:42.540> room<00:00:42.690> that<00:00:42.750> we<00:00:43.050> have<00:00:43.200> to<00:00:43.350> be<00:00:43.500> in<00:00:43.680> and

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
in the room that we have to be in and

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.290 
in the room that we have to be in and
the<00:00:44.070> first<00:00:44.250> thing<00:00:44.550> that<00:00:44.610> you're<00:00:44.850> going<00:00:44.910> to<00:00:45.059> do

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
the first thing that you're going to do

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.930 
the first thing that you're going to do
is<00:00:45.629> rotate<00:00:45.960> the<00:00:46.350> thing<00:00:46.559> over<00:00:46.770> so<00:00:47.640> you<00:00:47.700> go

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
is rotate the thing over so you go

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.940 
is rotate the thing over so you go
inside<00:00:48.360> the<00:00:48.570> other<00:00:48.719> room<00:00:48.989> because<00:00:49.620> that's

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
inside the other room because that's

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:56.930 
inside the other room because that's
where<00:00:50.250> the<00:00:50.280> access<00:00:50.910> to<00:00:51.180> it

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.950 

okay<00:00:57.940> so<00:00:58.000> this<00:00:58.300> is<00:00:58.420> the<00:00:58.540> words<00:00:58.720> that<00:00:58.780> you're

00:00:58.950 --> 00:00:58.960 
okay so this is the words that you're

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:03.170 
okay so this is the words that you're
supposed<00:00:59.230> to<00:00:59.350> be<00:00:59.470> in<00:00:59.650> if<00:00:59.980> you<00:01:00.100> come<00:01:00.250> over<00:01:00.430> here

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.350 

yesterday<00:01:04.180> panel<00:01:04.720> that<00:01:04.900> you<00:01:04.989> had<00:01:05.380> all<00:01:06.060> she<00:01:07.060> 18

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:07.360 
yesterday panel that you had all she 18

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:08.490 
yesterday panel that you had all she 18
assists<00:01:07.660> and<00:01:07.870> now<00:01:08.020> we're<00:01:08.170> just<00:01:08.320> going<00:01:08.470> to

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:08.500 
assists and now we're just going to

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:24.760 
assists and now we're just going to
rotate<00:01:08.680> it<00:01:09.010> over

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:24.770 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:27.680 

now<00:01:25.770> usually<00:01:26.070> and<00:01:26.340> when<00:01:26.940> you<00:01:27.060> do<00:01:27.210> this<00:01:27.420> it'll

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:27.690 
now usually and when you do this it'll

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:29.450 
now usually and when you do this it'll
either<00:01:27.870> be<00:01:27.990> great<00:01:28.140> because<00:01:28.800> you<00:01:29.040> said<00:01:29.220> it<00:01:29.250> at

either be great because you said it at
the<00:01:29.490> right<00:01:29.700> place<00:01:30.030> or<00:01:30.300> it'll<00:01:30.420> be<00:01:30.630> red<00:01:30.810> because

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
the right place or it'll be red because

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.080 
the right place or it'll be red because
it's<00:01:31.230> at<00:01:31.470> the<00:01:31.590> wrong<00:01:31.740> place<00:01:31.950> but<00:01:32.880> we're<00:01:33.060> not

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
it's at the wrong place but we're not

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.580 
it's at the wrong place but we're not
really<00:01:33.480> looking<00:01:33.810> for<00:01:34.020> either<00:01:34.080> one<00:01:34.320> of<00:01:34.380> those

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
really looking for either one of those

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.200 
really looking for either one of those
we're<00:01:34.890> actually<00:01:35.040> going<00:01:35.460> to<00:01:35.550> be<00:01:35.640> looking<00:01:35.850> for<00:01:36.180> a

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
we're actually going to be looking for a

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.100 
we're actually going to be looking for a
grayish<00:01:36.660> blue<00:01:36.990> color<00:01:38.570> so<00:01:39.570> just<00:01:39.810> come<00:01:39.960> in<00:01:40.080> here

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
grayish blue color so just come in here

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.870 
grayish blue color so just come in here
and<00:01:40.350> you<00:01:40.590> take<00:01:40.740> these<00:01:40.890> panels<00:01:41.310> all<00:01:41.490> nice

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
and you take these panels all nice

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:49.490 
and you take these panels all nice
access<00:01:42.450> to<00:01:42.480> the<00:01:42.780> computer<00:01:43.290> mainframe<00:01:48.500> back

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
access to the computer mainframe back

00:01:49.500 --> 00:02:00.620 
access to the computer mainframe back
away<00:01:49.680> from<00:01:49.830> the<00:01:50.070> fuse<00:01:50.430> born<00:01:59.210> to<00:02:00.210> make<00:02:00.330> sure<00:02:00.540> you

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
away from the fuse born to make sure you

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.060 
away from the fuse born to make sure you
think<00:02:00.780> I'm<00:02:00.930> all<00:02:01.200> three<00:02:01.410> of<00:02:01.500> those<00:02:01.680> and<00:02:01.740> then

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
think I'm all three of those and then

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.410 
think I'm all three of those and then
we're<00:02:02.220> going<00:02:02.310> to<00:02:02.400> start<00:02:02.580> moving<00:02:02.730> the<00:02:03.060> fuses

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
we're going to start moving the fuses

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.130 
we're going to start moving the fuses
over

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:06.140 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:08.109 

so<00:02:06.710> for<00:02:06.920> these<00:02:07.010> first<00:02:07.310> II<00:02:07.580> you're<00:02:07.790> just<00:02:07.970> going

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 
so for these first II you're just going

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:09.700 
so for these first II you're just going
to<00:02:08.179> move<00:02:08.330> them<00:02:08.600> over<00:02:08.780> and<00:02:09.200> the<00:02:09.319> order<00:02:09.560> that

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:09.710 
to move them over and the order that

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:13.870 
to move them over and the order that
they're<00:02:09.890> int<00:02:10.600> and<00:02:11.709> for<00:02:12.709> these<00:02:12.830> next<00:02:13.100> ones<00:02:13.370> that

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:13.880 
they're int and for these next ones that

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:15.250 
they're int and for these next ones that
I've<00:02:13.970> hit<00:02:14.120> in<00:02:14.240> the<00:02:14.300> top<00:02:14.450> one<00:02:14.780> up<00:02:14.900> at<00:02:15.020> all<00:02:15.170> if

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
I've hit in the top one up at all if

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:25.410 
I've hit in the top one up at all if
you're<00:02:15.350> going<00:02:15.470> to<00:02:15.530> put<00:02:15.709> it<00:02:15.800> on<00:02:15.860> the<00:02:15.980> bottom

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.270 

and<00:02:25.990> once<00:02:26.170> you<00:02:26.290> get<00:02:26.410> all<00:02:26.530> four<00:02:26.800> of<00:02:26.860> those<00:02:27.040> in

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
and once you get all four of those in

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.729 
and once you get all four of those in
and<00:02:27.459> you<00:02:27.520> turn<00:02:27.730> around<00:02:28.319> that's<00:02:29.319> going<00:02:29.560> to<00:02:29.620> lift

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:29.739 
and you turn around that's going to lift

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:31.949 
and you turn around that's going to lift
up<00:02:29.920> there<00:02:30.190> and<00:02:30.640> then<00:02:31.180> you<00:02:31.270> can<00:02:31.450> rotate<00:02:31.630> the

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:31.959 
up there and then you can rotate the

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:35.250 
up there and then you can rotate the
thing<00:02:32.140> again

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.570 

and<00:02:36.260> this<00:02:36.409> is<00:02:36.530> actually<00:02:36.680> going<00:02:37.099> to<00:02:37.190> take<00:02:37.340> you

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:37.580 
and this is actually going to take you

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:57.610 
and this is actually going to take you
to<00:02:37.730> the<00:02:37.849> room<00:02:38.000> that<00:02:38.239> at<00:02:38.390> that

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:59.720 

so<00:02:58.620> once<00:02:58.799> you<00:02:58.890> crawl<00:02:59.099> through<00:02:59.280> just<00:02:59.549> right

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
so once you crawl through just right

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:01.789 
so once you crawl through just right
there<00:02:59.909> on<00:03:00.000> the<00:03:00.030> ground<00:03:00.299> and<00:03:00.719> enjoy<00:03:01.379> the<00:03:01.650> game

00:03:01.789 --> 00:03:01.799 
there on the ground and enjoy the game

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:06.049 
there on the ground and enjoy the game
and<00:03:02.280> your<00:03:02.579> extra<00:03:03.359> 20<00:03:03.719> gamerscore
