00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:26.160 
very small tip just vamps I got my

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:27.680 
very small tip just vamps I got my
brains<00:04:26.400> back<00:04:26.610> I'm<00:04:26.880> thinking<00:04:27.240> more<00:04:27.360> little

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:27.690 
brains back I'm thinking more little

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:29.659 
brains back I'm thinking more little
eligibly<00:04:28.230> a<00:04:28.260> little<00:04:28.440> bit<00:04:28.530> more<00:04:28.680> fluidly<00:04:29.340> there

00:04:29.659 --> 00:04:29.669 
eligibly a little bit more fluidly there

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:32.420 
eligibly a little bit more fluidly there
I've<00:04:30.270> come<00:04:30.480> back<00:04:30.630> from<00:04:30.780> space<00:04:31.650> with<00:04:32.010> the<00:04:32.100> music

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:32.430 
I've come back from space with the music

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:33.590 
I've come back from space with the music
they're<00:04:32.580> trying<00:04:32.850> to<00:04:32.880> deconstruct<00:04:33.180> and

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:33.600 
they're trying to deconstruct and

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:34.970 
they're trying to deconstruct and
explain<00:04:33.960> everything<00:04:34.169> while<00:04:34.590> I'm<00:04:34.710> doing<00:04:34.950> it

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:34.980 
explain everything while I'm doing it

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:37.040 
explain everything while I'm doing it
which<00:04:35.100> is<00:04:35.130> a<00:04:35.280> bad<00:04:35.550> idea<00:04:35.580> that's<00:04:36.120> how<00:04:36.210> you<00:04:36.270> fall

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:37.050 
which is a bad idea that's how you fall

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:39.440 
which is a bad idea that's how you fall
when<00:04:37.169> you're<00:04:37.290> flying<00:04:38.000> everybody<00:04:39.000> on<00:04:39.150> the<00:04:39.240> play

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:39.450 
when you're flying everybody on the play

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:41.120 
when you're flying everybody on the play
there's<00:04:39.780> the<00:04:39.990> wrong<00:04:40.200> idea<00:04:40.500> the<00:04:40.680> wrong<00:04:40.860> time

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:41.130 
there's the wrong idea the wrong time

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:42.510 
you're all gonna plummet out the sky oh

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:44.600 
you're all gonna plummet out the sky oh
they<00:04:42.840> call<00:04:43.020> it<00:04:43.140> a<00:04:43.230> wind<00:04:43.470> shear<00:04:43.770> huh<00:04:44.070> I<00:04:44.280> call<00:04:44.460> it

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:44.610 
they call it a wind shear huh I call it

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:48.390 
they call it a wind shear huh I call it
up<00:04:44.700> disbelief<00:04:45.360> a<00:04:45.660> wave<00:04:46.620> of<00:04:46.860> disbelief

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:48.400 
up disbelief a wave of disbelief

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:51.000 
up disbelief a wave of disbelief
pocket<00:04:48.760> of<00:04:48.880> vacuum<00:04:49.720> sucking<00:04:50.139> disbelief<00:04:50.979> that

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:51.010 
pocket of vacuum sucking disbelief that

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:52.620 
pocket of vacuum sucking disbelief that
everybody<00:04:51.790> doesn't<00:04:52.000> believe<00:04:52.240> the<00:04:52.330> plane<00:04:52.479> can

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:52.630 
everybody doesn't believe the plane can

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:53.969 
everybody doesn't believe the plane can
fly<00:04:52.660> at<00:04:52.900> that<00:04:53.050> very<00:04:53.169> moment<00:04:53.380> rolling<00:04:53.830> down

00:04:53.969 --> 00:04:53.979 
fly at that very moment rolling down

00:04:53.979 --> 00:04:56.700 
fly at that very moment rolling down
anyway<00:04:54.850> don't<00:04:55.210> worry<00:04:55.330> about<00:04:55.510> it<00:04:55.930> if<00:04:56.199> daily

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:56.710 
anyway don't worry about it if daily

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:58.230 
anyway don't worry about it if daily
ever<00:04:56.919> happens<00:04:57.280> is<00:04:57.400> always<00:04:57.610> one<00:04:57.880> there's

00:04:58.230 --> 00:04:58.240 
ever happens is always one there's

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:59.730 
ever happens is always one there's
always<00:04:58.449> one<00:04:58.690> who<00:04:58.810> believes<00:04:59.139> and<00:04:59.500> is<00:04:59.560> usually

00:04:59.730 --> 00:04:59.740 
always one who believes and is usually

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:01.830 
always one who believes and is usually
the<00:05:00.040> pilot<00:05:00.400> that<00:05:00.669> wonderful<00:05:01.300> copilot<00:05:01.720> side

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:01.840 
the pilot that wonderful copilot side

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:04.020 
the pilot that wonderful copilot side
god<00:05:02.050> bless<00:05:02.260> the<00:05:02.380> pilots<00:05:02.740> as<00:05:03.040> they<00:05:03.250> say<00:05:03.550> I<00:05:03.820> don't

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:04.030 
god bless the pilots as they say I don't

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:05.580 
god bless the pilots as they say I don't
usually<00:05:04.120> say<00:05:04.419> God<00:05:04.600> bless<00:05:04.690> anything<00:05:05.199> because

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:05.590 
usually say God bless anything because

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:07.350 
usually say God bless anything because
to<00:05:05.710> me<00:05:05.830> God<00:05:06.100> is<00:05:06.370> an<00:05:06.580> expression<00:05:06.970> of<00:05:07.150> a<00:05:07.240> higher

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:07.360 
to me God is an expression of a higher

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:09.000 
to me God is an expression of a higher
dimensional<00:05:07.960> consciousness<00:05:08.199> into<00:05:08.620> which<00:05:08.830> we

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:09.010 
dimensional consciousness into which we

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:11.250 
dimensional consciousness into which we
are<00:05:09.040> involved<00:05:09.430> in<00:05:10.030> so<00:05:10.210> why<00:05:10.360> would<00:05:10.600> you<00:05:10.690> extract

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:11.260 
are involved in so why would you extract

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.320 
are involved in so why would you extract
it<00:05:11.470> from<00:05:11.500> yourself<00:05:12.130> therefore<00:05:12.669> all<00:05:12.850> just<00:05:13.240> a

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:13.330 
it from yourself therefore all just a

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:14.700 
it from yourself therefore all just a
piece<00:05:13.540> of<00:05:13.570> it<00:05:13.780> you<00:05:13.960> know<00:05:14.260> what<00:05:14.380> I'm<00:05:14.470> saying

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:14.710 
piece of it you know what I'm saying

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:16.140 
piece of it you know what I'm saying
then<00:05:14.949> why<00:05:15.280> come<00:05:15.430> up<00:05:15.550> with<00:05:15.669> the<00:05:15.760> word<00:05:15.940> for

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:16.150 
then why come up with the word for

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:17.550 
then why come up with the word for
something<00:05:16.510> there<00:05:16.690> that<00:05:16.990> you're<00:05:17.139> already<00:05:17.410> on

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:17.560 
something there that you're already on

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:19.200 
something there that you're already on
in<00:05:17.919> a<00:05:17.979> way<00:05:18.130> not<00:05:18.370> saying<00:05:18.580> that<00:05:18.669> you<00:05:18.820> are<00:05:18.850> would

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:19.210 
in a way not saying that you are would

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:20.820 
in a way not saying that you are would
you<00:05:19.240> all<00:05:19.479> I'm<00:05:19.570> saying<00:05:19.780> to<00:05:19.840> mentally<00:05:20.470> speaking

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:20.830 
you all I'm saying to mentally speaking

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:22.260 
you all I'm saying to mentally speaking
you're<00:05:20.949> in<00:05:21.070> folded<00:05:21.460> into<00:05:21.610> something<00:05:22.120> there

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:22.270 
you're in folded into something there

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:23.760 
you're in folded into something there
because<00:05:22.720> you're<00:05:22.840> thinking<00:05:22.960> of<00:05:23.199> consciousness

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:23.770 
because you're thinking of consciousness

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:25.200 
because you're thinking of consciousness
death<00:05:24.070> you're<00:05:24.580> not<00:05:24.669> thinking<00:05:24.940> of<00:05:25.000> it<00:05:25.090> as<00:05:25.180> a

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:25.210 
death you're not thinking of it as a

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:25.740 
death you're not thinking of it as a
phenomenon

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:25.750 
phenomenon

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:28.020 
phenomenon
so<00:05:26.080> if<00:05:26.199> consciousness<00:05:26.590> is<00:05:26.740> a<00:05:26.830> phenomena<00:05:27.370> and

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:28.030 
so if consciousness is a phenomena and

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:30.000 
so if consciousness is a phenomena and
it's<00:05:28.300> a<00:05:28.389> real<00:05:28.570> event<00:05:29.229> that's<00:05:29.410> occurring<00:05:29.500> there

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:30.010 
it's a real event that's occurring there

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:31.110 
it's a real event that's occurring there
it<00:05:30.100> has<00:05:30.220> to<00:05:30.370> occur<00:05:30.490> in<00:05:30.610> the<00:05:30.699> context<00:05:31.030> of

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:31.120 
it has to occur in the context of

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:32.279 
it has to occur in the context of
something<00:05:31.300> better<00:05:31.660> so<00:05:31.810> there's<00:05:31.990> gotta<00:05:32.139> be<00:05:32.199> a

00:05:32.279 --> 00:05:32.289 
something better so there's gotta be a

00:05:32.289 --> 00:05:33.900 
something better so there's gotta be a
dimensional<00:05:32.770> infolding<00:05:33.250> there<00:05:33.460> because<00:05:33.729> we

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:33.910 
dimensional infolding there because we

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:35.610 
dimensional infolding there because we
are<00:05:34.090> you<00:05:34.570> know<00:05:34.690> three<00:05:34.960> dimensional<00:05:35.320> beings

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:35.620 
are you know three dimensional beings

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:37.770 
are you know three dimensional beings
experience<00:05:36.100> over<00:05:36.340> time<00:05:36.370> for<00:05:36.940> a<00:05:37.060> dimension<00:05:37.570> so

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:37.780 
experience over time for a dimension so

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:39.300 
experience over time for a dimension so
that<00:05:37.900> multiple<00:05:38.289> dimensions<00:05:38.770> and<00:05:38.979> folding

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:39.310 
that multiple dimensions and folding

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:41.640 
that multiple dimensions and folding
each<00:05:39.430> other<00:05:39.669> to<00:05:39.880> happen<00:05:40.320> that's<00:05:41.320> why<00:05:41.500> I<00:05:41.560> don't

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:41.650 
each other to happen that's why I don't

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:45.480
