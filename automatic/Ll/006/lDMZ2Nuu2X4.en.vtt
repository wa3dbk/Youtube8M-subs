00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.520
 hello to all these tricycles the smart 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:04.200
 games for you and today we are 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:04.740
 found for a new bilic enough 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.280
 easy to do 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.750
 so this bleach is to make three 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.290
 chests but the gift the third is 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.660
 invisible 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:16.529
 as you see here we see the 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:18.630
 safe but very finally overall 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.890
 invisible so we're going to open it 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.869
 third chest nothing happens 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.730
 finally it's quite normal as a 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.430
 basic chest but on louvre that one 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:29.460
 we see that there is already a texture guy 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:32.610
 a big bug of the textures on on 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.829
 the two chests finally are there so what 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.640
 public is very very easy to do 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.680
 as I say at three seconds 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.629
 behind so we'll try we're already going 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.300
 we will test the beach will put 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:45.180
 many things in it like that 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:48.420
 like this see that good not in 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.950
 the inventory of course but that's like 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.949
 you see we've put a lot of more 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.539
 above and even on the beautiful of 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.780
 textures 20 on the beak the two goals of 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:01:01.410
 textures that what about the two stuff 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:05.869
 of the body so here we see that it is 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:09.000
 pose so we already know that it works 

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:11.100
 could we try itx to see 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.840
 how we do it's very easy to 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.189
 do it but it does not work on 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.080
 servers facing marc on the servers 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:18.420
 private with pals if you swear 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.340
 with friends or all alone or whatever 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.220
 something like that it could work or 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.820
 unless you are modo a server with 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.189
 many languages 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:29.009
 so as you see here I broke the 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.270
 including those invisible chest glitch is 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.079
 very easy to do so we will do it 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.240
 right now 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:36.840
 so just type this command 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.960
 like these click on input so 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:42.470
 as you see the chest landed 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.470
 but he is invisible 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:47.780
 so that's it works it works very very 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.660
 well 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:52.830
 so here we go we just have to 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:54.060
 do it like that like this one 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:57.360
 breaks everything in question we break everything 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:02:00.390
 so then but that's what we will ask 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.920
 his suitcases then dwells there you 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.650
 will need any block we will 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.840
 to take wood is the important element 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:10.800
 the trunk it works even with the 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:12.990
 chests of nothing breaks you so 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:16.380
 then you will have to lay blocks 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:19.020
 like these to leave a space for 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:21.780
 the 3rd chest which is a place finally 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:23.880
 third coop that will be glitch is given 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.460
 for editing so the third chest 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:29.130
 who will be glitch and then he will you 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:33.330
 will have to come back to this place as I 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:36.390
 mounted thaler and type the same command 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:37.530
 so I let you watch her I 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:39.780
 go m at the same time on the description 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:42.390
 of the video so after having 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:44.940
 clicked on the entry the glitch walk to 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:48.030
 perfection as you see so 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:49.640
 it may be useful for 3 your 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:52.680
 friends or something like that 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:54.420
 besides if you play on a server and 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:57.720
 that you are a big asshole you go 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:03:01.050
 do that so voila voila here I think 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.410
 that the video is over very determined 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:03.660
 very quickly 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:06.690
 so thanks for watching this little 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:09.300
 video and we end up in a new 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:11.090
 next glitch or in an android game 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:15.890
 or on other games for example good 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:15.890
 it was 6.2, nothing for him
