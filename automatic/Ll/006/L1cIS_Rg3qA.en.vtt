00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:25.880
The golden star indicates that there is a general in the tank

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.300
This is one of the major changes in this year's military parade

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.640
Reporter: Are there any other changes

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:36.000
The tanks are also numbered in a different way this time

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.640
TJ means assault

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.040
and number one indicates that the tank is in the first formation

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.720
and 02 means that it is the second tank in the formation

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:50.580
All the armaments in the 27 formations are divided into groups according to their functions

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.920
Many people think that the current T-99 tanks are almost the same with its previous versions

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.060
But I can say that they are qualitatively different

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:23.260
It's a big step forward from mechanization to informationization

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:30.000
Driving an old tank was a challenge for the physical strength of the driver

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.060
but now it's a challenge for the driver's wisdom

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:09.500
It is closer to a real battle, as the drivers can hardly have any chances to look at the buttons and switches when operating tanks on the battlefield

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:11.860
They have to look at the front and observe what is going on at the battlefield

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:15.620
and their hands have to find the buttons automatically without looking at them

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:21.100
Through such trainings, we have become more familiar with the operation of tanks
