to Brian Murphy hi we have a project at

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:14.209 
to Brian Murphy hi we have a project at
Intel<00:00:12.660> labs<00:00:12.870> China<00:00:13.200> that<00:00:13.590> I<00:00:13.710> wanted<00:00:14.009> to<00:00:14.099> show

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
Intel labs China that I wanted to show

Intel labs China that I wanted to show
you<00:00:14.250> guys<00:00:14.370> this<00:00:15.210> is<00:00:15.360> the<00:00:15.509> smart<00:00:16.170> homes<00:00:16.460> DIY

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
you guys this is the smart homes DIY

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:18.830 
you guys this is the smart homes DIY
programmable<00:00:18.029> home<00:00:18.210> service<00:00:18.539> so<00:00:18.600> why<00:00:18.690> don't

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
programmable home service so why don't

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.560 
programmable home service so why don't
you<00:00:18.869> walk<00:00:19.109> us<00:00:19.140> through<00:00:19.260> a<00:00:19.529> quick<00:00:19.859> demo<00:00:20.390> okay<00:00:21.390> I

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
you walk us through a quick demo okay I

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.290 
you walk us through a quick demo okay I
can<00:00:21.810> try<00:00:22.130> all<00:00:23.130> right<00:00:23.310> so<00:00:23.460> the<00:00:23.580> general<00:00:23.850> idea<00:00:23.939> of

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
can try all right so the general idea of

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.900 
can try all right so the general idea of
our<00:00:24.480> project<00:00:24.510> is<00:00:25.080> that<00:00:25.260> as<00:00:25.609> people<00:00:26.609> have<00:00:26.730> more

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
our project is that as people have more

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.790 
our project is that as people have more
and<00:00:27.090> more<00:00:27.240> smart<00:00:27.570> devices<00:00:27.900> in<00:00:28.199> their<00:00:28.320> home<00:00:28.500> and

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
and more smart devices in their home and

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.410 
and more smart devices in their home and
things<00:00:29.189> which<00:00:29.580> actually<00:00:29.910> have<00:00:30.029> compute

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
things which actually have compute

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.319 
things which actually have compute
capability<00:00:31.430> the<00:00:32.430> the<00:00:32.730> problem<00:00:33.090> becomes

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
capability the the problem becomes

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:34.700 
capability the the problem becomes
actually<00:00:33.750> controlling<00:00:34.140> them<00:00:34.380> and<00:00:34.410> getting

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
actually controlling them and getting

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.350 
actually controlling them and getting
them<00:00:34.829> to<00:00:34.860> talk<00:00:35.160> to<00:00:35.309> each<00:00:35.430> other<00:00:35.640> in<00:00:35.880> ways<00:00:36.090> that

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
them to talk to each other in ways that

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.500 
them to talk to each other in ways that
the<00:00:36.450> user<00:00:36.630> wants<00:00:37.020> right<00:00:37.860> now<00:00:37.920> people<00:00:38.910> people

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
the user wants right now people people

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.540 
the user wants right now people people
are<00:00:39.600> very<00:00:39.780> experienced<00:00:40.739> in<00:00:40.890> technical<00:00:41.399> tech

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
are very experienced in technical tech

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.459 
are very experienced in technical tech
savy<00:00:41.910> can<00:00:42.180> program<00:00:42.600> their<00:00:42.840> devices<00:00:43.320> and

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
savy can program their devices and

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.529 
savy can program their devices and
connect<00:00:43.739> them<00:00:43.829> together<00:00:44.040> but<00:00:44.879> usually<00:00:45.360> they

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
connect them together but usually they

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:46.910 
connect them together but usually they
would<00:00:45.719> they<00:00:46.050> might<00:00:46.230> set<00:00:46.410> it<00:00:46.440> up<00:00:46.620> in<00:00:46.739> a<00:00:46.800> way

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
would they might set it up in a way

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.650 
would they might set it up in a way
that's<00:00:47.160> not<00:00:47.309> what<00:00:47.550> the<00:00:47.670> typical<00:00:47.940> user<00:00:48.239> wants

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
that's not what the typical user wants

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.420 
that's not what the typical user wants
and<00:00:48.870> so<00:00:49.020> we're<00:00:49.620> trying<00:00:49.800> to<00:00:49.890> look<00:00:49.980> at<00:00:50.160> how<00:00:50.370> we

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
and so we're trying to look at how we

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.360 
and so we're trying to look at how we
can<00:00:50.789> create<00:00:51.590> composable<00:00:52.590> devices<00:00:53.070> that<00:00:53.250> are

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
can create composable devices that are

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.279 
can create composable devices that are
more<00:00:53.520> flexible<00:00:53.670> so<00:00:54.270> that<00:00:54.449> computer<00:00:55.140> by<00:00:55.260> the

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
more flexible so that computer by the

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.060 
more flexible so that computer by the
end-user<00:00:56.180> in<00:00:57.180> order<00:00:57.600> to<00:00:57.809> put<00:00:58.649> things<00:00:58.829> together

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
end-user in order to put things together

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.920 
end-user in order to put things together
the<00:00:59.460> way<00:00:59.579> they<00:00:59.760> want<00:00:59.940> them<00:01:00.030> so<00:01:00.390> for<00:01:00.539> example

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
the way they want them so for example

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:06.550 
the way they want them so for example
over<00:01:01.170> here<00:01:02.039> we<00:01:02.850> just<00:01:02.969> have<00:01:03.149> a<00:01:05.180> sample<00:01:06.180> device

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:06.560 
over here we just have a sample device

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.080 
over here we just have a sample device
for<00:01:07.560> example<00:01:07.619> a<00:01:07.890> camera<00:01:08.280> that<00:01:08.430> is<00:01:08.490> connected

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
for example a camera that is connected

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.109 
for example a camera that is connected
to<00:01:09.119> a<00:01:09.380> sort<00:01:10.380> of<00:01:10.409> microcontroller<00:01:11.280> these<00:01:12.030> are

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
to a sort of microcontroller these are

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:13.760 
to a sort of microcontroller these are
actually<00:01:12.360> research<00:01:12.659> prototypes<00:01:13.260> we<00:01:13.560> assume

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
actually research prototypes we assume

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.140 
actually research prototypes we assume
in<00:01:13.890> the<00:01:13.979> future<00:01:14.280> everyone's<00:01:14.670> going<00:01:14.880> to<00:01:14.970> have

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
in the future everyone's going to have

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.359 
in the future everyone's going to have
many<00:01:15.479> such<00:01:16.229> smart<00:01:16.470> devices<00:01:16.830> today<00:01:17.159> people

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
many such smart devices today people

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.280 
many such smart devices today people
have<00:01:17.640> mobile<00:01:17.939> phones<00:01:18.150> already

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
have mobile phones already

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.530 
have mobile phones already
they<00:01:20.250> actually<00:01:20.460> have<00:01:20.759> increasing<00:01:21.240> amount<00:01:21.450> of

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
they actually have increasing amount of

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.420 
they actually have increasing amount of
compute<00:01:21.869> in<00:01:21.990> them<00:01:22.140> but<00:01:23.009> here<00:01:23.130> you<00:01:23.280> have<00:01:23.400> a

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
compute in them but here you have a

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.270 
compute in them but here you have a
music<00:01:23.820> player<00:01:24.030> maybe<00:01:24.439> that<00:01:25.439> is<00:01:25.619> controlled<00:01:26.189> by

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
music player maybe that is controlled by

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.899 
music player maybe that is controlled by
a<00:01:26.400> computer<00:01:26.840> another<00:01:27.840> one<00:01:28.110> which<00:01:28.320> is<00:01:28.909> watching

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
a computer another one which is watching

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.630 
a computer another one which is watching
a<00:01:30.030> camera<00:01:30.420> and<00:01:30.630> is<00:01:31.560> able<00:01:31.770> to<00:01:31.979> send<00:01:32.189> this<00:01:32.340> camera

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
a camera and is able to send this camera

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.520 
a camera and is able to send this camera
data<00:01:32.820> actually<00:01:33.420> off<00:01:33.509> to<00:01:33.540> a<00:01:33.689> PC<00:01:34.140> which<00:01:34.380> is

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
data actually off to a PC which is

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.580 
data actually off to a PC which is
running<00:01:34.740> some<00:01:35.040> more<00:01:35.840> complicated<00:01:36.840> visual

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
running some more complicated visual

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.730 
running some more complicated visual
recognition<00:01:37.770> algorithms<00:01:38.670> so<00:01:39.540> so<00:01:40.079> the<00:01:40.290> camera

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
recognition algorithms so so the camera

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.800 
recognition algorithms so so the camera
will<00:01:40.860> recognize<00:01:41.280> the<00:01:41.790> baby's<00:01:42.119> behavior<00:01:42.329> and

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
will recognize the baby's behavior and

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.020 
will recognize the baby's behavior and
then<00:01:42.899> sort<00:01:43.140> of<00:01:43.200> you<00:01:43.979> could<00:01:44.100> program<00:01:44.490> in<00:01:44.700> the

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
then sort of you could program in the

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.270 
then sort of you could program in the
system<00:01:45.390> to<00:01:45.659> like<00:01:46.290> activate<00:01:46.770> the<00:01:46.860> music<00:01:46.950> player

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
system to like activate the music player

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.600 
system to like activate the music player
so<00:01:48.240> for<00:01:48.390> example<00:01:48.750> a<00:01:48.930> typical<00:01:49.350> user<00:01:49.860> might<00:01:50.430> in

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
so for example a typical user might in

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.280 
so for example a typical user might in
the<00:01:50.700> near<00:01:50.850> future<00:01:51.030> have<00:01:51.420> a<00:01:51.450> smart<00:01:51.840> camera<00:01:52.170> in

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
the near future have a smart camera in

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.889 
the near future have a smart camera in
their<00:01:52.409> home<00:01:52.619> they<00:01:53.100> might<00:01:53.310> have<00:01:53.490> a<00:01:53.520> smart<00:01:53.899> music

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
their home they might have a smart music

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.980 
their home they might have a smart music
player<00:01:55.110> that<00:01:55.530> can<00:01:55.770> play<00:01:55.829> music<00:01:56.610> on<00:01:56.729> demand<00:01:57.090> and

player that can play music on demand and

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.740 
player that can play music on demand and
they<00:01:58.140> might<00:01:58.350> say<00:01:58.560> well<00:01:58.799> can<00:01:59.280> I<00:01:59.399> have<00:02:00.210> a<00:02:00.270> music

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
they might say well can I have a music

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.149 
they might say well can I have a music
play<00:02:00.869> whenever<00:02:01.079> the<00:02:01.259> baby's<00:02:01.560> crying<00:02:01.829> maybe

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
play whenever the baby's crying maybe

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.639 
play whenever the baby's crying maybe
just<00:02:02.520> soothe<00:02:02.670> the<00:02:02.880> baby<00:02:03.110> but<00:02:04.110> how<00:02:04.259> to<00:02:04.320> get<00:02:04.530> that

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
just soothe the baby but how to get that

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.319 
just soothe the baby but how to get that
to<00:02:04.710> happen<00:02:05.219> is<00:02:05.369> actually<00:02:05.520> very<00:02:05.909> challenging

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
to happen is actually very challenging

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.190 
to happen is actually very challenging
right<00:02:06.450> now<00:02:06.509> so<00:02:06.869> we're<00:02:07.049> trying<00:02:07.259> to<00:02:07.439> to

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:08.200 
right now so we're trying to to

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:10.380 
right now so we're trying to to
come<00:02:08.830> up<00:02:08.920> with<00:02:09.069> a<00:02:09.099> software<00:02:09.640> framework<00:02:09.789> to

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390 
come up with a software framework to

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:12.119 
come up with a software framework to
make<00:02:10.629> it<00:02:10.780> easier<00:02:11.170> for<00:02:11.230> people<00:02:11.560> to<00:02:11.739> do<00:02:11.980> this

00:02:12.119 --> 00:02:12.129 
make it easier for people to do this

00:02:12.129 --> 00:02:13.740 
make it easier for people to do this
actually<00:02:12.519> with<00:02:12.910> two<00:02:13.060> sides<00:02:13.300> of<00:02:13.450> it<00:02:13.569> they<00:02:13.690> were

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
actually with two sides of it they were

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.720 
actually with two sides of it they were
interested<00:02:14.379> and<00:02:14.440> one<00:02:14.620> is<00:02:14.769> the<00:02:14.950> making<00:02:15.610> it

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
interested and one is the making it

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:17.430 
interested and one is the making it
easier<00:02:16.269> for<00:02:16.300> programmers<00:02:16.690> to<00:02:17.170> actually

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
easier for programmers to actually

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.290 
easier for programmers to actually
provide<00:02:17.769> software<00:02:18.250> components<00:02:18.849> to<00:02:18.940> control

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300 
provide software components to control

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:22.020 
provide software components to control
devices<00:02:19.599> so<00:02:20.410> we're<00:02:20.530> using<00:02:20.680> a<00:02:20.980> portable<00:02:21.700> and

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
devices so we're using a portable and

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.089 
devices so we're using a portable and
easy<00:02:22.209> to<00:02:22.420> use<00:02:22.450> html5<00:02:23.170> based<00:02:23.680> programming

00:02:24.089 --> 00:02:24.099 
easy to use html5 based programming

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:26.430 
easy to use html5 based programming
environment<00:02:24.670> that<00:02:25.239> programmers<00:02:25.750> can<00:02:25.959> create

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440 
environment that programmers can create

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.210 
environment that programmers can create
modules<00:02:26.950> and<00:02:27.280> then<00:02:28.060> a<00:02:28.769> we're<00:02:29.769> exploring<00:02:30.099> some

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
modules and then a we're exploring some

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.930 
modules and then a we're exploring some
graphical<00:02:31.209> programming<00:02:32.200> interfaces<00:02:32.940> which

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 
graphical programming interfaces which

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.300 
graphical programming interfaces which
can<00:02:34.720> be<00:02:34.840> used<00:02:35.019> by<00:02:35.140> end<00:02:35.349> users<00:02:35.769> to<00:02:35.799> configure

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
can be used by end users to configure

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:38.130 
can be used by end users to configure
their<00:02:36.760> devices<00:02:37.090> and<00:02:37.480> connect<00:02:37.810> them<00:02:37.959> together

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
their devices and connect them together

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:43.320 
their devices and connect them together
so<00:02:39.069> for<00:02:39.190> example<00:02:39.549> in<00:02:39.790> this<00:02:41.730> is<00:02:42.730> editor<00:02:43.180> which

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:43.330 
so for example in this is editor which

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:48.720 
so for example in this is editor which
we're<00:02:43.480> showing<00:02:43.690> here<00:02:44.200> a<00:02:46.620> user<00:02:47.620> can<00:02:48.010> select<00:02:48.310> say

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
we're showing here a user can select say

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:53.370 
we're showing here a user can select say
a<00:02:48.760> baby<00:02:49.140> the<00:02:50.140> baby<00:02:50.319> camera<00:02:51.239> module<00:02:52.380> which

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:53.380 
a baby the baby camera module which

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:54.960 
a baby the baby camera module which
which<00:02:53.680> a<00:02:53.799> programmer<00:02:54.310> must<00:02:54.519> have<00:02:54.670> have

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
which a programmer must have have

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:56.460 
which a programmer must have have
written<00:02:55.120> the<00:02:55.239> program<00:02:55.569> to<00:02:55.750> control<00:02:55.989> it<00:02:56.170> before

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
written the program to control it before

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:58.740 
written the program to control it before
but<00:02:56.650> the<00:02:56.769> user<00:02:56.950> can<00:02:57.220> probably<00:02:58.180> eventually

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 
but the user can probably eventually

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:01.259 
but the user can probably eventually
download<00:02:59.410> that<00:02:59.560> and<00:02:59.799> install<00:03:00.640> it<00:03:00.760> at<00:03:00.849> home<00:03:01.030> and

00:03:01.259 --> 00:03:01.269 
download that and install it at home and

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:03.240 
download that and install it at home and
then<00:03:01.750> they<00:03:01.900> can<00:03:02.110> choose<00:03:02.380> to<00:03:02.410> connect<00:03:02.950> it<00:03:03.069> to

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
then they can choose to connect it to

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:06.839 
then they can choose to connect it to
any<00:03:03.640> of<00:03:03.880> various<00:03:04.150> devices<00:03:04.390> such<00:03:04.989> as<00:03:05.049> a<00:03:05.849> music

00:03:06.839 --> 00:03:06.849 
any of various devices such as a music

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:09.330 
any of various devices such as a music
player<00:03:07.060> or<00:03:07.450> they<00:03:08.170> could<00:03:08.380> possibly<00:03:08.560> even<00:03:09.069> post

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
player or they could possibly even post

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.420 
player or they could possibly even post
a<00:03:09.640> Twitter<00:03:10.000> picture<00:03:10.450> feed<00:03:10.739> depending<00:03:11.739> on<00:03:12.160> if

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:12.430 
a Twitter picture feed depending on if

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:14.250 
a Twitter picture feed depending on if
they<00:03:12.910> think<00:03:12.970> the<00:03:13.209> baby<00:03:13.389> is<00:03:13.569> smiling<00:03:13.989> and<00:03:14.079> looks

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260 
they think the baby is smiling and looks

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.680 
they think the baby is smiling and looks
good<00:03:14.639> but<00:03:15.639> each<00:03:15.790> user<00:03:16.030> will<00:03:16.239> have<00:03:16.269> their<00:03:16.569> own

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:16.690 
good but each user will have their own

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:19.259 
good but each user will have their own
needs<00:03:17.350> as<00:03:17.769> far<00:03:18.010> as<00:03:18.190> how<00:03:18.370> to<00:03:18.430> connect<00:03:18.819> devices

00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:19.269 
needs as far as how to connect devices

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:20.849 
needs as far as how to connect devices
together<00:03:19.420> so<00:03:19.840> the<00:03:19.959> problem<00:03:20.319> comes<00:03:20.560> how<00:03:20.709> do<00:03:20.769> you

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:20.859 
together so the problem comes how do you

00:03:20.859 --> 00:03:23.190 
together so the problem comes how do you
make<00:03:21.700> it<00:03:21.730> convenient<00:03:22.269> for<00:03:22.299> people<00:03:22.690> to<00:03:22.870> put

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.200 
make it convenient for people to put

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:26.270 
make it convenient for people to put
these<00:03:23.350> together<00:03:23.530> and<00:03:23.799> so<00:03:24.150> by<00:03:25.150> having

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
these together and so by having

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.160 
these together and so by having
interchangeable<00:03:27.280> components<00:03:27.910> with<00:03:28.170> clean

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:29.170 
interchangeable components with clean

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:31.349 
interchangeable components with clean
interfaces<00:03:29.769> and<00:03:29.980> then<00:03:30.130> we<00:03:30.700> can<00:03:30.850> provide<00:03:31.150> an

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:31.359 
interfaces and then we can provide an

00:03:31.359 --> 00:03:33.720 
interfaces and then we can provide an
editor<00:03:31.870> which<00:03:32.139> lets<00:03:32.410> users<00:03:32.650> connect<00:03:33.609> them

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:33.730 
editor which lets users connect them

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:35.400 
editor which lets users connect them
together<00:03:33.880> very<00:03:34.299> simply<00:03:34.690> like<00:03:34.840> this<00:03:34.959> editor

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:35.410 
together very simply like this editor

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:37.410 
together very simply like this editor
we're<00:03:35.560> using<00:03:35.680> is<00:03:35.889> based<00:03:36.130> on<00:03:36.340> a<00:03:36.370> open<00:03:37.150> source

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:37.420 
we're using is based on a open source

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:42.240 
we're using is based on a open source
click<00:03:37.750> scripts<00:03:38.230> mashup<00:03:39.190> editor<00:03:39.810> and<00:03:41.130> in<00:03:42.130> our

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:42.250 
click scripts mashup editor and in our

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:45.330 
click scripts mashup editor and in our
case<00:03:42.459> we're<00:03:42.670> actually<00:03:42.959> unlike<00:03:43.959> a<00:03:44.019> a<00:03:44.410> webmaster

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.340 
case we're actually unlike a a webmaster

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:47.940 
case we're actually unlike a a webmaster
once<00:03:46.299> the<00:03:46.420> devices<00:03:46.720> can<00:03:47.049> once<00:03:47.260> a<00:03:47.380> system<00:03:47.650> is

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:47.950 
once the devices can once a system is

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:50.129 
once the devices can once a system is
configured<00:03:48.160> in<00:03:48.579> this<00:03:48.730> way<00:03:48.970> the<00:03:49.480> devices<00:03:49.930> talk

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:50.139 
configured in this way the devices talk

00:03:50.139 --> 00:03:52.229 
configured in this way the devices talk
to<00:03:50.260> each<00:03:50.380> other<00:03:50.560> directly<00:03:50.889> so<00:03:51.849> this<00:03:52.090> is

00:03:52.229 --> 00:03:52.239 
to each other directly so this is

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:54.089 
to each other directly so this is
editors<00:03:52.720> used<00:03:53.019> to<00:03:53.200> actually<00:03:53.349> configure<00:03:53.950> the

00:03:54.089 --> 00:03:54.099 
editors used to actually configure the

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:56.370 
editors used to actually configure the
system<00:03:54.489> but<00:03:55.150> finally<00:03:55.690> when<00:03:55.840> the<00:03:55.930> system<00:03:56.230> is

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:56.380 
system but finally when the system is

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:58.740

configured<00:03:56.709> it<00:03:57.099> just<00:03:57.370> runs<00:03:57.549> by<00:03:57.730> itself<00:03:58.060> which

00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:58.750 
configured it just runs by itself which

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:01.110 
configured it just runs by itself which
makes<00:03:58.930> it<00:03:59.109> possible<00:03:59.260> to<00:03:59.560> use<00:03:59.680> it<00:03:59.799> for<00:04:00.160> a<00:04:00.639> more

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:01.120 
makes it possible to use it for a more

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:02.940 
makes it possible to use it for a more
reliable<00:04:01.359> thecase<00:04:01.959> like<00:04:02.170> the<00:04:02.290> baby<00:04:02.470> you<00:04:02.889> know

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:02.950 
reliable thecase like the baby you know

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:05.909 
reliable thecase like the baby you know
monitor<00:04:03.310> you<00:04:03.430> don't<00:04:03.579> want<00:04:03.730> it<00:04:03.790> to<00:04:03.910> to<00:04:04.620> fail<00:04:05.620> if

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:05.919 
monitor you don't want it to to fail if

00:04:05.919 --> 00:04:08.640 
monitor you don't want it to to fail if
the<00:04:06.250> network<00:04:07.000> shuts<00:04:07.299> down<00:04:07.540> or<00:04:07.840> your<00:04:08.049> DSL<00:04:08.440> fail

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:08.650 
the network shuts down or your DSL fail

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:11.190 
the network shuts down or your DSL fail
we<00:04:08.829> have<00:04:09.090> just<00:04:10.090> a<00:04:10.180> sample<00:04:10.540> picture<00:04:10.690> of<00:04:10.930> a<00:04:10.989> baby

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:11.200 
we have just a sample picture of a baby

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:14.220 
we have just a sample picture of a baby
crying<00:04:11.579> okay<00:04:12.579> so<00:04:12.760> you<00:04:12.940> notice<00:04:13.419> that<00:04:13.450> when<00:04:14.109> the

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:14.230 
crying okay so you notice that when the

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:15.960 
crying okay so you notice that when the
picture<00:04:14.530> was<00:04:14.680> shown<00:04:14.859> when<00:04:15.310> the<00:04:15.459> baby<00:04:15.669> looked

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:15.970 
picture was shown when the baby looked

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:18.000 
picture was shown when the baby looked
like<00:04:16.090> he<00:04:16.180> was<00:04:16.299> crying<00:04:16.539> then<00:04:16.870> the<00:04:17.079> music

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:18.010 
like he was crying then the music

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:19.380 
like he was crying then the music
started<00:04:18.310> playing<00:04:18.579> and<00:04:18.700> in<00:04:18.820> another<00:04:19.090> case<00:04:19.359> the

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:19.390 
started playing and in another case the

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:21.240 
started playing and in another case the
baby<00:04:19.690> may<00:04:19.930> be<00:04:19.959> awake<00:04:20.320> and<00:04:20.560> smiling<00:04:21.010> and<00:04:21.159> then

baby may be awake and smiling and then

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:21.550 
baby may be awake and smiling and then
you<00:04:21.370> can

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:21.560 
you can

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:28.000 
you can
have<00:04:21.709> play<00:04:22.070> a<00:04:22.100> story<00:04:26.440> so<00:04:27.440> in<00:04:27.680> this<00:04:27.800> case

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:28.010 
have play a story so in this case

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:29.350 
have play a story so in this case
actually<00:04:28.340> in<00:04:28.430> actuality<00:04:28.730> these<00:04:29.090> small

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:29.360 
actually in actuality these small

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:31.810 
actually in actuality these small
microcontrollers<00:04:30.169> aren't<00:04:30.530> yet<00:04:31.310> powerful

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:31.820 
microcontrollers aren't yet powerful

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:33.730 
microcontrollers aren't yet powerful
enough<00:04:32.030> to<00:04:32.090> do<00:04:32.419> the<00:04:32.720> image<00:04:32.900> recognition<00:04:33.139> so

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:33.740 
enough to do the image recognition so

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:35.560 
enough to do the image recognition so
it's<00:04:33.860> actually<00:04:34.160> necessary<00:04:34.760> to<00:04:35.270> have<00:04:35.419> these

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:35.570 
it's actually necessary to have these

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:37.780 
it's actually necessary to have these
devices<00:04:35.750> connected<00:04:36.500> to<00:04:36.710> a<00:04:36.740> PC<00:04:37.250> or<00:04:37.280> a<00:04:37.520> server

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:37.790 
devices connected to a PC or a server

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:40.240 
devices connected to a PC or a server
which<00:04:38.090> can<00:04:38.120> do<00:04:38.930> the<00:04:39.080> appropriate<00:04:39.950> image

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:40.250 
which can do the appropriate image

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:43.000 
which can do the appropriate image
recognition
