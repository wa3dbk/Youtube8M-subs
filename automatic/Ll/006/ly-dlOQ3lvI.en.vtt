 itself proclaimed and the government in 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.190
 Kiev, came to power in the wake of the people 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.040
 grievances 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:11.929
 connection with the refusal of President Yanukovych 

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:11.929
 sign an association agreement with the EU 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:18.930
 As the waters will be if the agreement with 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.109
 the European Union will not be signed then 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:24.750
 according to article 111 of the criminal code 

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:30.179
 the president will receive from 10 to 15 years in prison 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:34.050
 prison kiau however later and tunic 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:36.090
 had to back down we put off 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.640
 while signing the economic section 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.670
 of this document taking into account 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.860
 experiencing concerns will not zone 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.379
 free trade to negative 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:49.230
 implications for industrialized regions 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:51.809
 because when you analyze the pros and cons 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.820
 you understand what is easier said than done 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.070
 contradiction is getting bigger and by 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.600
 Apparently with the so-called new 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:02.969
 Government do not agree, and have already 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:04.949
 almost everything from Kiev we also 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:07.290
 heard a promise to join nato and 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.479
 get as many weapons from 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.310
 the member countries of the alliance Verkhovna Rada 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.530
 was registered 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.350
 bill of process renewal 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.759
 Ukraine's integration into NATO 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:19.740
 need to provide as much as possible 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.659
 materiel and technical 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:25.259
 support the form of modern military 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:27.020
 equipment and weapons and again and tunic 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:29.460
 I had to take my words back 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:32.880
 solely for the sake of unity 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:36.170
 Ukraine, the question of joining NATO 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.170
 on the agenda 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:46.750
 What about the promise to ban Russian 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:48.970
 language and remain hall danik number one I 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:51.070
 i want i want ukrainian 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:53.410
 young people spoke no Russian she 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:55.930
 English this will be my priority 

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:58.570
 task i want to not go to europe 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:03.130
 Here is my task clear but also Europe and tse 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:07.800
 Our task no one attempts to your 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:11.920
 the right to freely use the Russian language 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:14.200
 Russian language according to this law in 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:17.500
 all areas where prevail 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:20.860
 Russian-speaking has the status dry your and 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:23.350
 regional and de facto official 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:26.590
 language with the same features and 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:29.770
 rights like his Ukrainian it was 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:31.990
 180 degree turn this speech is strong 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:34.390
 contrasted with previous statements 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:36.490
 and cynic further at some point was 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:38.550
 Visa charges announced with 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:38.550
 Russia 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:46.030
 national security council and 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.650
 Defense has decided to introduce 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:50.410
 visa regime with Russia 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:51.750
 this decision was rejected and entirely on 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:54.070
 next day 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:55.780
 Ukraine should not rush to the introduction 

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:58.030
 visa regime with Russia 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:00.220
 here you need to measure seven times and one 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:02.410
 cut off almost a month has passed since 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.040
 the moment I appreciate the post of prime minister 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:05.110
 Ukraine 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.390
 however, during this time he did not show 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:09.700
 what is able to accomplish besides threats 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:11.830
 which he fails to arise 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:14.140
 the question is whether its long term 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:16.360
 politics is just as volatile and will 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:18.400
 whether he as often as now take 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:20.730
 your words back marina Kosareva
