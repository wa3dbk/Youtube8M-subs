00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
 hellmann love today comes the first 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.629
 Do not follow a summer series that does not 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.639
 from the blog and in this video I show 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:10.469
 you could wear four hairstyles if 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:11.849
 the heat somehow knows too much 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:13.889
 her if you have her neck or neck 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.570
 because of the hairs, that's why 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.250
 Here are four hairstyles for you 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.550
 and I like this here and you 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.550
 have fun 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:32.010
 okay the sf lotte of braid actually 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.320
 But from Germany would be easy 

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:36.480
 Waterfall braid for that you have yours 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.280
 brushing our hair because we are doing a lot 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.640
 surfaces and have no knots 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.640
 would like 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:46.510
 you do not care how you got the shuttle 

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:48.910
 you just have to get one piece from one 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:50.470
 Side take about as much as that divides 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:52.300
 Then you just in three strands and 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:54.840
 once the normal three 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:54.840
 strict braid 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:05.059
 then you take from the top piece of hair and 

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:06.680
 surface that says so with 1 below 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:07.880
 he was not hair then you take 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.220
 just the voice sounds like that somehow 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.750
 under the chin takes the whole new one 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:12.950
 strand from the open hair and 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.229
 surfactants with 1 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:19.570
 so always a strand out there 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:19.570
 it depends both rossi 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:28.220
 if he thinks it's enough so maybe 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:31.010
 you just continue with two normal 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:33.799
 bands I fix the whole and opens 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:35.509
 around the taps around it meaningless hangs around 

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:43.220
 and then you are finally on with the 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:44.869
 first hairstyle called the tents hairstyle 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:46.729
 be hippie header and it needs 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:47.450
 you no bobby fans from the hot 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:50.000
 super easy 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:53.390
 We start by asking for it 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.340
 take and our upper head pater 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:58.190
 compartment actually all they about the 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:00.170
 eyebrows are and they have to 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:02.119
 To be completely differentiated at the back and the 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:05.289
 Let's just go with it 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:05.289
 any Hague lama fixed 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:11.070
 now takes from any side 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:14.130
 right or left is no matter one piece 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:16.230
 hair is not too big and she shares that 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:18.480
 then just once more in two 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.130
 so that top partner is gone because 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.380
 it is way too high then we need it 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:26.270
 So that's me, I'll just do it 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:26.270
 This was so annoying to me 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:34.980
 then the whole thing does not escape at the beginning 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:39.200
 too tight ok just a bit loose 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:39.200
 and thank you very well 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.670
 so much distance you can leave and 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:49.290
 now you can do all this with it 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:51.030
 no drum so flies then have it 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:53.430
 Put her the easier position 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:54.780
 it should say it up as below because 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.670
 It does not look that great down there 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:59.370
 not with me then you take the whole 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:01.620
 on the other side takes two 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:03.900
 nowhere in any case 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.380
 down not the years we clamped down 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.030
 to have 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:08.790
 and then simply escapes the very 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:12.090
 normal with the two takes and stand 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:13.110
 this slaughtered strand and 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.630
 maybe that's just how it is said 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:17.610
 downward 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:19.380
 the hair from above makes it easy 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:21.030
 in midfield or something and since 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:23.549
 actually already finished the super cool 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:29.040
 hip ilo that my favorite place ex 

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:31.440
 hippie third president double break 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:33.630
 track and for that you have your whole 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:36.330
 bring forward a piece of hair from h 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:38.459
 take the right upper side and there 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:40.980
 made to braid but crafted 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:42.870
 instead of over the middle under the middle 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:46.459
 this is called the spray and the 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:46.459
 surface then it was all the way down 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:52.400
 and when you're done you're attached 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:53.900
 the simple with such a brace the 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.630
 braid then just over your head with it 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:57.560
 she does not annoy and just under it 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:04:00.280
 take design piece of hair and the same thing 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:00.280
 do it again 

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:15.750
 and you do the same on the 

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:16.980
 other side if he did that 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:18.690
 you see that one side maybe 

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:21.750
 a bit on the side of a page 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:23.760
 flat and listless looks like you pull out 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:26.040
 just a piece out so that's one 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:27.780
 bit stronger and the braid to himself 

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:29.550
 gets bigger then the whole takes 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:33.230
 Just go back and have hair 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:33.230
 attach that to a ponytail 

00:04:35.249 --> 00:04:39.359
 to make the westbahn turns the whole 

00:04:37.679 --> 00:04:41.519
 just disappeared in a circle then 

00:04:39.359 --> 00:04:43.709
 such a hole is created in the middle and there 

00:04:41.519 --> 00:04:45.449
 then just go through the top and 

00:04:43.709 --> 00:04:47.009
 then you just stick with it 

00:04:45.449 --> 00:04:49.409
 bobby pellens then just sticks 

00:04:47.009 --> 00:04:52.429
 any hairs just that should be 

00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:52.429
 you look messi 

00:04:53.289 --> 00:04:57.550
 so should the whole then from behind 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:59.229
 look something all depends on how 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:02.199
 you want to take then you just the 

00:04:59.229 --> 00:05:04.659
 top strelitz this upper winter trace 

00:05:02.199 --> 00:05:07.240
 remove the clamp and roll it over 

00:05:04.659 --> 00:05:11.559
 the spell and where it ends take him 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:12.849
 just install and consolidate that 

00:05:11.559 --> 00:05:16.559
 You also do the same with the other 

00:05:12.849 --> 00:05:16.559
 side and also with the bottom 

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:31.700
 and when you're done, that should be 

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:33.710
 look something like this that is 

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:37.330
 super good if you have the neck free 

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:37.330
 Want or something and that is maybe so 

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:41.390
 the last look is great for the start 

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:43.790
 because you do not need a hair gum 

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:45.050
 maybe just a bub in but okay it 

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:46.790
 is a vers tail no side 

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:49.370
 and I just have mine for that 

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:51.620
 first stage with a rubber made away 

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:53.060
 because I come to the club then 

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:55.880
 Let's just take a piece of 

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:58.010
 the rear cock and turn it over 

00:05:55.880 --> 00:06:01.000
 the hall around so make a kind 

00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:01.000
 hair tie with cock 

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:07.500
 you do it as long as until the 

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:10.200
 tip remains then in the clever 

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:12.870
 bobby pins and just fix it that way 

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:15.000
 vertical 3 and that's it so it looks 

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:17.340
 then in the end I find it super easy 

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.500
 and yet take such a loop or 

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:21.510
 something that it really awesome if you 

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:23.250
 really do not stop at their hair 

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:24.960
 but want a bit dry so dry 

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:26.520
 you just want to be behind 

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:26.970
 attach to the head and you're done 

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:29.310
 their 

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:31.850
 I failed again 

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:31.850
 back again
