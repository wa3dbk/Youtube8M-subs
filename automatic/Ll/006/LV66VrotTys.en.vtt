in a little pamphlet like this and

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.480 
in a little pamphlet like this and
that's<00:02:24.510> the<00:02:24.690> secret<00:02:24.930> poor<00:02:25.500> bright<00:02:26.010> gel

that's the secret poor bright gel

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:28.790 
that's the secret poor bright gel
foundation<00:02:27.270> and<00:02:27.900> I<00:02:28.020> think<00:02:28.260> I'm<00:02:28.380> gonna<00:02:28.500> have<00:02:28.680> to

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.470 
foundation and I think I'm gonna have to
try<00:02:29.070> this<00:02:29.130> next<00:02:29.760> I'm<00:02:29.850> gonna<00:02:29.940> try<00:02:30.120> the<00:02:30.180> little

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.270 
try this next I'm gonna try the little
sample<00:02:30.660> the<00:02:30.960> CD<00:02:31.200> they<00:02:31.650> were<00:02:31.710> nice<00:02:31.920> enough<00:02:32.130> to

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
sample the CD they were nice enough to

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.000 
sample the CD they were nice enough to
send<00:02:32.610> me<00:02:32.670> a<00:02:32.760> couple<00:02:33.120> of<00:02:33.210> different<00:02:33.600> colors<00:02:34.010> if

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
send me a couple of different colors if

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:36.740 
send me a couple of different colors if
you're<00:02:35.220> Korean<00:02:35.550> you<00:02:35.790> know<00:02:35.910> I<00:02:35.940> feel<00:02:36.450> like<00:02:36.570> most

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
you're Korean you know I feel like most

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.780 
you're Korean you know I feel like most
people<00:02:37.110> are<00:02:37.200> number<00:02:37.500> 23<00:02:37.980> I<00:02:38.010> don't<00:02:38.280> know<00:02:38.670> what

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
people are number 23 I don't know what

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.820 
people are number 23 I don't know what
that<00:02:38.910> means<00:02:39.090> but<00:02:39.270> basically<00:02:40.260> it's<00:02:40.470> whitening

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
that means but basically it's whitening

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:43.040 
that means but basically it's whitening
pore<00:02:41.130> minimizing<00:02:41.790> high<00:02:42.000> pigment<00:02:42.510> foundation

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
pore minimizing high pigment foundation

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.470 
pore minimizing high pigment foundation
and<00:02:43.260> concealer<00:02:43.610> finishing<00:02:44.610> pour<00:02:44.910> less<00:02:45.120> powder

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
and concealer finishing pour less powder

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.480 
and concealer finishing pour less powder
so<00:02:46.260> I<00:02:46.290> guess<00:02:46.530> it<00:02:46.680> like<00:02:46.830> kind<00:02:47.040> of<00:02:47.070> like<00:02:47.220> sets

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:47.490 
so I guess it like kind of like sets

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:50.960 
so I guess it like kind of like sets
itself<00:02:47.880> or<00:02:48.150> in<00:02:48.240> one<00:02:48.920> long<00:02:49.920> wearing<00:02:50.250> foundation

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
itself or in one long wearing foundation

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:52.580 
itself or in one long wearing foundation
and<00:02:51.480> then<00:02:51.600> you<00:02:51.690> have<00:02:51.840> to<00:02:51.960> see<00:02:52.170> the<00:02:52.350> little

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
and then you have to see the little

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:55.160 
and then you have to see the little
picture<00:02:52.890> on<00:02:53.040> it<00:02:53.190> is<00:02:53.370> that<00:02:53.540> it's<00:02:54.540> not<00:02:54.750> just<00:02:54.990> big

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
picture on it is that it's not just big

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:56.810 
picture on it is that it's not just big
