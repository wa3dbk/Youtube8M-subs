00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:52.670 
way past I and when you get to the top

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:54.370 
way past I and when you get to the top
you<00:01:52.880> want<00:01:53.120> to<00:01:53.180> run<00:01:53.360> a<00:01:53.390> street<00:01:53.750> out<00:01:53.960> onto<00:01:54.260> the

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:55.970 
platform because if you don't do it fast

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:58.300 
platform because if you don't do it fast
enough<00:01:56.090> they'll<00:01:56.390> pull<00:01:56.570> you<00:01:56.690> off<00:01:56.980> right<00:01:57.980> here

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.010 
and I just
almost<00:02:01.040> fucked<00:02:01.310> up<00:02:01.520> and<00:02:02.090> here<00:02:02.299> they<00:02:02.450> go<00:02:02.659> for

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.020 
almost fucked up and here they go for

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.100 
almost fucked up and here they go for
some<00:02:03.170> reason<00:02:03.470> they<00:02:03.560> just<00:02:03.770> decide<00:02:04.250> to<00:02:04.369> jump

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:05.110 
some reason they just decide to jump

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:11.010 
some reason they just decide to jump
every<00:02:06.110> time

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:11.020 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:14.870 

it's<00:02:12.020> pretty<00:02:12.230> lame<00:02:12.470> but

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:23.730 

some<00:02:15.480> reason<00:02:15.840> if<00:02:16.680> you<00:02:16.830> jump<00:02:17.130> you<00:02:17.280> don't<00:02:17.430> die

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:23.740 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:26.640 

it'd<00:02:24.160> be<00:02:24.280> nice<00:02:24.490> to<00:02:24.520> get<00:02:25.510> to<00:02:25.690> a<00:02:25.720> bigger<00:02:26.200> building

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
it'd be nice to get to a bigger building

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:30.360 
it'd be nice to get to a bigger building
like<00:02:27.100> perhaps<00:02:27.730> those<00:02:28.470> big<00:02:29.470> towers<00:02:29.710> of<00:02:29.950> like

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
like perhaps those big towers of like

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:31.800 
like perhaps those big towers of like
flying<00:02:30.670> saucers<00:02:30.790> and<00:02:31.210> you<00:02:31.420> get<00:02:31.600> somebody

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
flying saucers and you get somebody

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:34.100 
flying saucers and you get somebody
chase<00:02:32.110> you<00:02:32.290> up<00:02:32.320> there<00:02:32.560> they'd<00:02:32.740> be<00:02:32.860> cooler<00:02:33.490> but

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
chase you up there they'd be cooler but
