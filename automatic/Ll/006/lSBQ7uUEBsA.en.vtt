00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:15.990
 The news this week car 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.380
 welcome to the car week journal of 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.849
 Friday, September 19, 2014 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:22.349
 this is a very special edition because 

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:22.890
 it's the 500th time we have this 

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:26.700
 journal 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.750
 make it was Tuesday, April 19, 2008 then 

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:29.730
 luc franck there us then 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.529
 deputy head return it here for the 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.940
 first time 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.040
 a week later it was Stefan's turn 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.260
 and I was number 3 with which the trio van 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.120
 was complete one year later 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.360
 Luc left car week and now sit 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.979
 also roy and marco in the carousel in van 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.600
 the recurring subjects from 

00:00:43.979 --> 00:00:47.460
 day 1 a nationalist i always the 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.229
 artist impressions the look in the 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.479
 future at a glance that is yet to come 

00:00:49.229 --> 00:00:54.030
 and Alexander who often seem surprising 

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:56.129
 well afterwards it appears eh yes that's right 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.570
 sometimes better of course 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.580
 other we have sometimes had that 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.100
 so we look back something of three years 

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:04.140
 since we thought oh my god 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.180
 how did we show this 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.950
 none of it is true but luckily most of the time then 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.470
 it will be fine 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.100
 it comes in different ways 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.200
 position 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.450
 sometimes you have spyshots of course 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.400
 cars camouflage today and you'll see 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.630
 the lines are already pretty good 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.340
 Based on that you can get a good one 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.320
 make illustration 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.030
 of course you have concept cars 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.080
 have to put off a big weird wheels 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.300
 exterior mirrors 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.240
 if you make that just that normal 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:32.340
 then you also have a good production car 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.740
 and sometimes you have spyshots that come about 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.290
 are administrations that have been established 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.480
 is because something already in your stator 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.740
 has been able to see at the manufacturer 

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:44.730
 so that you really have the resources 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.990
 secretly so that was sometimes so 

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:48.060
 for example so 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.290
 in the past we had corner of field 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.240
 that they are afraid of autobild 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.550
 We also used that was surely 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.680
 generally known that that man was going 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:57.479
 especially with the German brands that they already 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.330
 who saw cars land and then 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:02.070
 just nice to draw and that 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:04.290
 we therefore also very good ones 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.880
 illustrations on the bus do occur 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.340
 as a political game a manufacturer 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.710
 website yes, of course, they also want that 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.510
 that little response to the and 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:14.220
 that humans can win a little already 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.780
 to the design so have the self on 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.290
 also benefits but it varies 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.690
 per brand 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:21.840
 some brands mainly from your premises you 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:23.610
 keep everything scrupulously now and later 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.290
 only show something very late and so it is 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:28.050
 harder to put on 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.670
 very early Japanese term 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:31.470
 Holders place you have I remember last 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.750
 years in conversation with ivo van hulten 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:35.970
 our former opening designs 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.380
 now Porsche and I left him 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.600
 see our drawings of future ones 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.700
 opels and the man smiled gently 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.020
 wisely shut them up 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.640
 can you imagine that designing 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:46.620
 sometimes think of dude actually i had it 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:49.320
 also would like to do yes sometimes we hear 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:52.470
 indeed they think well 

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:54.930
 is quite a nice suggestion 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:56.820
 but yes we are an illustrator of ours 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.160
 which can of course draw freely and 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:01.290
 the people who actually have cars 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:03.240
 designs are more tied to certain 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:05.280
 technical things that the car surrounds 

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:06.960
 signed of course you can 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.460
 Imagine that every one blocks from 

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:10.500
 us a letter at some point 

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:12.120
 from a cucumber manufacturer 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.650
 talk because we have a vacancy like 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.830
 designer and what you all makes that 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:19.710
 we do see are that's certainly true 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:21.300
 it is even true that our own marco van 

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:23.430
 you overbeeke a lot these days 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:24.870
 makes illustrations for us 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:26.940
 involved in the design of a 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:28.380
 Dutch sports car that is from 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:30.480
 silverline 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:32.790
 and that's a car where we will be next week 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:35.760
 be able to report more about it so that is real 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:38.490
 yes i am a bit of a car week car and 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:40.470
 anyway designers of ours had it too 

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:43.230
 radovan factory chuck that is one 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:45.150
 canadian with balkan roots 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:46.260
 and that is also doing pretty well 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:48.480
 been in the past that has 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:52.440
 for example a drawing of the opel 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:54.150
 zafira made almost seamless 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:56.790
 whatever actually happens 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:58.590
 came so yes we have pretty good ones 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:00.270
 things usually yes so I even order 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:02.010
 obedient to the long line of adrian 

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:03.810
 van hooydonk anomalous van den akker 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:05.550
 level of hulten will soon be ours 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:07.950
 add your own illustrator 

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:09.060
 yes, as far as we are concerned, a bit happy 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:10.800
 a car week 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:12.870
 sauce is over it then be 

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:13.900
 our future fuse completely reliable 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:15.310
 thing is yes 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:17.470
 but it will be fine okay thank you 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:19.090
 lex without it 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:20.440
 last Tuesday is a big part 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:22.180
 from the Netherlands is busy with regards 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:24.250
 of the ladies dignitaries 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:25.360
 and a small disadvantage about finances 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:26.610
 roy you hear that second group 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:28.289
 happy 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:30.629
 what is the car news financially 

00:04:28.289 --> 00:04:32.219
 but wait for it later because there is 

00:04:30.629 --> 00:04:33.840
 not a car letter it was just like that 

00:04:32.219 --> 00:04:35.159
 it became increasingly clear that that car 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.780
 would rather not get the Budget Day 

00:04:35.159 --> 00:04:38.400
 as well as no surprise but you feel it 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:40.650
 as the news that work quite limited 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:42.419
 because why can't he be the reason 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:43.530
 Many people think he had walked 

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:44.759
 enough stability to just him 

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:46.259
 changed prince's day that arrives 

00:04:44.759 --> 00:04:47.789
 deadline is fairly well known but that was 

00:04:46.259 --> 00:04:49.020
 the case is not suspected 

00:04:47.789 --> 00:04:50.879
 probably he doesn't have enough support 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:52.139
 has for the plans that it has because 

00:04:50.879 --> 00:04:53.669
 is not that they have a new plan 

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:54.990
 then you can even go and see 

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:56.729
 what room think because all that guilt 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:57.990
 processed because for Polish all that fast 

00:04:56.729 --> 00:05:00.479
 for their own majority, therefore 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:01.620
 tgd pda this cabinet and apparently was 

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:02.699
 that majority is not there yet and that 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:04.590
 That probably means the plans 

00:05:02.699 --> 00:05:06.150
 have gone quite far that was just like that 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:07.379
 very good is one is very easy 

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:08.639
 get sense for days 

00:05:07.379 --> 00:05:10.560
 so the formula plenty quite large 

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:12.210
 interventions but you have to go far 

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:13.979
 suspicions which way it goes without 

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:15.539
 Well he needs all the general 

00:05:13.979 --> 00:05:17.039
 trend has let you know to the 

00:05:15.539 --> 00:05:18.389
 rooms of general letters now two 

00:05:17.039 --> 00:05:19.919
 things video on the one it says i want 

00:05:18.389 --> 00:05:21.150
 mouth center sampling because he complains 

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:22.439
 have themselves down about that as was 

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:23.729
 itself is so complicated in terms of say 

00:05:22.439 --> 00:05:24.990
 hypocritical but well he was not on the 

00:05:23.729 --> 00:05:27.539
 power to be without became so on the 

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:29.939
 law politically and something very negative 

00:05:27.539 --> 00:05:31.889
 the bpm house that combines two things 

00:05:29.939 --> 00:05:34.020
 then it could be that he thinks he is 

00:05:31.889 --> 00:05:35.729
 to a possible abolition of the bpm 

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:36.719
 a kind of reduction for a different form 

00:05:35.729 --> 00:05:38.909
 from tax to insurance 

00:05:36.719 --> 00:05:40.169
 radical and certainly you get the pvda 

00:05:38.909 --> 00:05:41.370
 again not because the xenon panic the 

00:05:40.169 --> 00:05:43.740
 car becomes cheaper that it gets 

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:44.819
 they will not see compensated and will be left 

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:45.779
 is to be convinced of the 

00:05:44.819 --> 00:05:47.279
 need for those plans to maybe 

00:05:45.779 --> 00:05:48.870
 wind that in one he does well because 

00:05:47.279 --> 00:05:50.009
 he otherwise no majority what is that 

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:51.750
 word is discussing say 

00:05:50.009 --> 00:05:52.949
 but yes yes it is purely political 

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:54.180
 choice that is the reason there is none yet 

00:05:52.949 --> 00:05:55.560
 decision is that is not because they are not 

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:57.210
 had enough time or could not continue 

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:58.379
 but because they are not enough 

00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:59.460
 have political support for the 

00:05:58.379 --> 00:06:01.409
 plans like him that appear before 

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:02.719
 you had an idea of ​​when 

00:06:01.409 --> 00:06:05.129
 get to know it 

00:06:02.719 --> 00:06:06.449
 no in the sense of I don't know any dates 

00:06:05.129 --> 00:06:08.819
 also no matter of days here there 

00:06:06.449 --> 00:06:10.199
 weeks and maybe months but them 

00:06:08.819 --> 00:06:11.909
 want to get things out of February 

00:06:10.199 --> 00:06:14.279
 so I don't have unlimited time 

00:06:11.909 --> 00:06:15.479
 so i think they are inside now and 2 times 

00:06:14.279 --> 00:06:17.189
 let's be a sound anyway 

00:06:15.479 --> 00:06:21.120
 hope a little earlier under the Christmas tree so 

00:06:17.189 --> 00:06:23.279
 thank you roy the roof can go off 

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:27.419
 car week 18 present three new ones 

00:06:23.279 --> 00:06:30.419
 convertibles de golf de alfa romeo mito and 

00:06:27.419 --> 00:06:32.639
 The Audi A1 is not the farmer's car week 

00:06:30.419 --> 00:06:34.510
 news desk that 's all a bit 

00:06:32.639 --> 00:06:36.760
 not in the same class 

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:38.830
 well that is not quite true the wave 

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:39.160
 that size is bigger than the alpha and the 

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:41.010
 audi 

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:43.690
 because they last around ten minutes 

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:45.130
 but where in terms of price everything bullies are equal 

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:47.290
 may be because it is in the segment 

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:48.520
 which welcome the oil and the robberies 

00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:51.040
 on what may cost more 

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:51.970
 ok it is near future or is still 

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:54.280
 further 

00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:56.470
 well the rollers that expect in 2010 

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:58.450
 in the summer and the alpha and the audi pass 

00:06:56.470 --> 00:06:59.770
 in the spring of 2011 so it goes 

00:06:58.450 --> 00:07:01.600
 they all last ff 

00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:03.880
 yes admittedly we are sometimes also 

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:05.440
 completely beside that wave that plan 

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:09.190
 indeed only a year later and that 

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:10.390
 not o &amp; a one that have never come that 

00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:12.250
 does not take away that much 

00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:13.870
 more often had at the end so good 

00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:14.410
 remain us for the next five hundred 

00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:16.600
 editions 

00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:18.070
 I wish you are very nice 

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:20.230
 weekend and then it will probably work because 

00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:21.520
 car week 38 is since Wednesday in the 

00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:22.870
 stores 

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:24.460
 forget half past four on Saturday afternoon 

00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:26.080
 cannot be tuned to sbs6 

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:28.630
 because then you can watch episode 3 

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:30.070
 again from our own big boys 

00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:32.230
 nice that you watched and happy to see you 

00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:35.820
 next week to next week 

00:07:32.230 --> 00:07:35.820
 until next week to dog week
