00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.180
 we lose a balloon , we inflate it 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:46.469
 completely and every year the two 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:51.629
 end with a node for the crush 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:59.489
 calculate half or fold it and it 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:01:01.590
 we share with the simple person the 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:05.810
 ears are already ready we support them 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:10.460

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:12.900
 take a gray balloon 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:16.170

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.490
 width of a motorcycle 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:28.780
 at this point we make a small one 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:31.689
 ball with the twist technique ad 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:41.890
 ear will serve us later for 

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:44.860
 fixing the ears we do another 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:47.409
 sausage of the same size and alla 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:57.429
 end another ball with the technique 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:02:15.010
 of the twist to the ear we fix the 

00:01:57.429 --> 00:02:18.519
 knot around this ball we support 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:21.160

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:25.900
 we take another balloon and it 

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:29.950
 we inflate completely leaving free 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:32.500
 and three or four fingers we make 267 of the 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:35.970
 width of three fingers and fix between 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.970
 them with simple twist 

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:50.970
 at this point we make another ball 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:03:02.099
 always the technical one and the traction ad 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:03:04.680

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:06.840
 cheeks of our bunny 2 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:37.560
 ring twists of the same 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:39.090
 perfect size we begin to unite 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.190
 our parts 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:45.000
 take the balloon we have 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:48.269
 done before we go behind the nose 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.870
 and we fix it right here on the twist 

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:50.870
 by ear 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:13.250
 the head of the forest nothing ahead 

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:17.140
 we lack the ears and let us give them back 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:17.140
 let's fix right here on this portion 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:35.540
 now let us proceed with the body of ours 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:37.820
 bunny we calculate the height and in 

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:45.860
 this point we divide it with one 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:47.840
 simple twist with the balloon 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:50.180
 gray we complete the body by doing 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:51.080
 two other sausages of the same 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:53.270
 size 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:55.730
 let's fix the first behind this twist 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:59.020
 by ear and the second right here in 

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:59.020
 between the two balloons 

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:24.240
 now we only need the paws with the 

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:26.160
 part of remaining balloon we do 

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:31.220
 a small kitchen at the end of 

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:33.990
 balloon and it will be our tail 

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:37.020
 close the balloon forming it 

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:45.540
 circle and fix a ball or in 

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:48.300
 between the two balloons to transform 

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:50.940
 this ring in two paws is enough 

00:05:48.300 --> 00:06:00.960
 crush it and vidal in half with the 

00:05:50.940 --> 00:06:02.880
 simple pressure the pink balloon 

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:19.340
 we don't need it anymore we divide it with one 

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:22.020
 twist and let it burst now 

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:24.680
 let's fix our own well 

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:24.680
