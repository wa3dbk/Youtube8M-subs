that<00:01:17.610> I've<00:01:17.759> tried<00:01:18.119> I<00:01:18.509> love<00:01:19.170> them<00:01:19.350> have<00:01:19.530> made<00:01:19.740> it

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
that I've tried I love them have made it

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.840 
that I've tried I love them have made it
been<00:01:20.040> like<00:01:20.250> up<00:01:20.700> here<00:01:20.990> maybe<00:01:21.990> is<00:01:22.860> up<00:01:23.250> there<00:01:23.549> in

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
been like up here maybe is up there in

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.120 
been like up here maybe is up there in
that<00:01:24.060> range<00:01:24.330> but<00:01:24.720> not<00:01:24.930> as<00:01:25.049> lows<00:01:25.259> this<00:01:25.500> so<00:01:25.770> i

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
that range but not as lows this so i

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.749 
that range but not as lows this so i
guess<00:01:26.759> you<00:01:26.970> can<00:01:27.330> roll<00:01:27.600> your<00:01:27.630> ankle<00:01:28.340> to<00:01:29.340> get<00:01:29.729> a

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
guess you can roll your ankle to get a

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:33.050 
guess you can roll your ankle to get a
nice<00:01:29.939> flick<00:01:30.590> so<00:01:31.590> that<00:01:31.770> helps<00:01:32.220> a<00:01:32.340> bit<00:01:32.549> better

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
nice flick so that helps a bit better

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.700 
nice flick so that helps a bit better
flick<00:01:33.420> so<00:01:33.840> there's<00:01:34.740> so<00:01:35.610> the<00:01:36.560> rotation<00:01:37.560> of<00:01:37.680> your

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
flick so there's so the rotation of your

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.240 
flick so there's so the rotation of your
ankle<00:01:37.979> isn't<00:01:38.280> so<00:01:38.640> limited<00:01:39.150> to<00:01:39.750> the<00:01:39.869> shoes<00:01:40.250> now
