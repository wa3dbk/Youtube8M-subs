don't have the Wi-Fi let's say some of
the<00:01:49.829> old<00:01:49.950> phones<00:01:50.189> so<00:01:50.700> for<00:01:51.030> them<00:01:51.180> you<00:01:51.360> can<00:01:51.509> do

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
the old phones so for them you can do

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.330 
the old phones so for them you can do
the<00:01:51.750> Bluetooth<00:01:52.110> feature<00:01:52.350> both<00:01:53.070> were

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
the Bluetooth feature both were

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.760 
the Bluetooth feature both were
perfectly<00:01:53.909> fine<00:01:54.180> so<00:01:54.869> for<00:01:55.079> this<00:01:55.380> video

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
perfectly fine so for this video

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.319 
perfectly fine so for this video
tutorial<00:01:55.950> will<00:01:56.369> be<00:01:56.399> doing<00:01:56.610> the<00:01:56.790> Wi-Fi<00:01:57.119> hotspot

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
tutorial will be doing the Wi-Fi hotspot

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:01.520 
tutorial will be doing the Wi-Fi hotspot
so<00:01:58.229> all<00:01:58.380> I<00:01:58.409> have<00:01:58.590> to<00:01:58.619> do<00:01:58.890> is<00:01:59.100> click<00:01:59.430> here<00:02:00.259> and<00:02:01.259> it

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
so all I have to do is click here and it

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.319 
so all I have to do is click here and it
starts<00:02:02.040> doing<00:02:02.369> the<00:02:02.579> verifying<00:02:03.030> internet

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
starts doing the verifying internet

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:04.730 
starts doing the verifying internet
connection<00:02:03.719> is<00:02:03.840> going<00:02:03.930> to<00:02:04.049> start<00:02:04.290> my<00:02:04.409> Wi-Fi

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
connection is going to start my Wi-Fi

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.069 
connection is going to start my Wi-Fi
hotspot<00:02:05.250> in<00:02:05.340> a<00:02:05.399> couple<00:02:05.610> of<00:02:05.670> seconds<00:02:06.030> the<00:02:06.869> name

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
hotspot in a couple of seconds the name

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.559 
hotspot in a couple of seconds the name
of<00:02:07.259> my<00:02:07.409> hot<00:02:07.860> spot<00:02:08.160> would<00:02:08.369> be<00:02:08.429> Android<00:02:08.970> 82

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
of my hot spot would be Android 82

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.300 
of my hot spot would be Android 82

here I have an iPad which is Wi-Fi only
version<00:02:32.450> not<00:02:33.450> cheating<00:02:33.870> right<00:02:34.140> here<00:02:34.410> and<00:02:34.850> I

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
version not cheating right here and I

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:39.050 
version not cheating right here and I
will<00:02:37.470> try<00:02:37.650> to<00:02:37.680> connect<00:02:38.010> it<00:02:38.100> to<00:02:38.160> Android<00:02:38.670> 82

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
will try to connect it to Android 82

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:40.820 
will try to connect it to Android 82
which<00:02:39.420> is<00:02:39.690> what<00:02:40.020> the<00:02:40.170> name<00:02:40.320> of<00:02:40.440> my<00:02:40.560> this

which is what the name of my this

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:44.449 
which is what the name of my this
network<00:02:41.459> is<00:02:41.670> so<00:02:42.420> here<00:02:42.660> we<00:02:42.990> go<00:02:43.260> we<00:02:43.950> click

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
network is so here we go we click

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:48.320 
network is so here we go we click

free<00:03:10.260> Wi-Fi<00:03:10.860> hotspot<00:03:11.640> access<00:03:12.090> but<00:03:12.600> this<00:03:12.750> does

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:12.989 
free Wi-Fi hotspot access but this does

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:14.390 
free Wi-Fi hotspot access but this does
not<00:03:13.020> mean<00:03:13.410> it<00:03:13.560> gives<00:03:13.709> you<00:03:13.830> unlimited<00:03:13.950> data

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
not mean it gives you unlimited data

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.640 
not mean it gives you unlimited data
plan<00:03:14.700> so<00:03:15.600> if<00:03:15.690> you<00:03:15.780> have<00:03:15.870> a<00:03:15.930> 2<00:03:16.110> gigabyte<00:03:16.320> data

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
plan so if you have a 2 gigabyte data

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:18.440 
plan so if you have a 2 gigabyte data
plan<00:03:16.980> you<00:03:17.190> still<00:03:17.489> have<00:03:17.640> a<00:03:17.670> 2<00:03:17.850> gigabyte<00:03:18.060> data

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
plan you still have a 2 gigabyte data

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.840 
plan you still have a 2 gigabyte data
plan<00:03:18.720> but<00:03:19.230> you<00:03:19.320> can<00:03:19.470> use<00:03:19.620> this<00:03:19.769> on<00:03:19.980> on<00:03:20.160> here<00:03:20.700> and

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:20.850 
plan but you can use this on on here and

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:23.210 
plan but you can use this on on here and
here<00:03:21.360> so<00:03:22.140> you<00:03:22.200> still<00:03:22.560> you're<00:03:22.830> going<00:03:23.070> to<00:03:23.160> be

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
here so you still you're going to be

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:24.830 
here so you still you're going to be
using<00:03:23.489> minutes<00:03:23.760> off<00:03:23.880> of<00:03:23.910> your<00:03:24.180> 2<00:03:24.330> gigabyte
