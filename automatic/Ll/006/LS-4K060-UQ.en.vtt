00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
launcher and then into the time-space

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.250 
launcher and then into the time-space
continuum<00:02:22.500> through<00:02:23.430> a<00:02:23.489> wormhole<00:02:23.819> on<00:02:24.420> to<00:02:25.140> the

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
continuum through a wormhole on to the

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:26.990 
continuum through a wormhole on to the
moon<00:02:25.470> and<00:02:25.800> then<00:02:25.980> they<00:02:26.099> hit<00:02:26.280> a<00:02:26.310> teleporter<00:02:26.970> and

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
moon and then they hit a teleporter and

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.020 
moon and then they hit a teleporter and
blow<00:02:27.330> up<00:02:27.510> that<00:02:28.069> fusion<00:02:29.069> coil<00:02:29.280> on<00:02:29.580> the

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
blow up that fusion coil on the

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:31.729 
blow up that fusion coil on the
receiving<00:02:30.600> end<00:02:30.690> of<00:02:30.900> the<00:02:31.050> teleporter<00:02:31.560> because

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:31.739 
receiving end of the teleporter because

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:34.340 
receiving end of the teleporter because
obviously<00:02:31.920> when<00:02:32.790> grenades<00:02:32.940> go<00:02:33.450> through<00:02:33.840> deep

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
obviously when grenades go through deep

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:36.550 
obviously when grenades go through deep
space<00:02:34.560> they<00:02:35.069> have<00:02:35.100> to<00:02:35.459> explode<00:02:35.819> eventually<00:02:36.330> so

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560 
space they have to explode eventually so

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.960 
space they have to explode eventually so
you're<00:02:37.560> gonna<00:02:37.650> walk<00:02:37.890> through<00:02:38.130> that<00:02:38.220> hole<00:02:38.550> what

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
you're gonna walk through that hole what

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:43.640 
you're gonna walk through that hole what

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
on this warthog and then he like blows

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.690 
on this warthog and then he like blows
that<00:02:56.730> thing<00:02:57.030> a<00:02:57.390> ton<00:02:57.810> and<00:02:58.140> I<00:02:58.860> am<00:02:59.190> not<00:02:59.459> totally

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
that thing a ton and I am not totally

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.300 
that thing a ton and I am not totally
sure<00:02:59.970> why<00:03:00.360> because<00:03:00.720> he<00:03:01.680> just<00:03:01.860> grabs<00:03:02.130> the

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
sure why because he just grabs the

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:06.380 
sure why because he just grabs the
sniper<00:03:02.580> here<00:03:04.280> so<00:03:05.280> I<00:03:05.310> guess<00:03:05.459> you're<00:03:05.940> supposed

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
sniper here so I guess you're supposed

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:09.530 
sniper here so I guess you're supposed
to<00:03:06.510> drop<00:03:06.720> that<00:03:06.780> little<00:03:07.470> box<00:03:07.650> thing<00:03:08.010> onto<00:03:08.540> that

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
to drop that little box thing onto that

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:13.430 
to drop that little box thing onto that
so<00:03:10.319> that<00:03:10.560> it<00:03:11.269> it<00:03:12.269> blows<00:03:12.690> it<00:03:12.900> up<00:03:12.989> I<00:03:13.140> guess<00:03:13.290> he's

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
so that it it blows it up I guess he's

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.620 
so that it it blows it up I guess he's
cheating<00:03:13.860> a<00:03:13.920> little<00:03:13.950> bit<00:03:14.160> but<00:03:14.850> it<00:03:15.209> was<00:03:15.360> taken

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
cheating a little bit but it was taken

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:16.970 
cheating a little bit but it was taken
him<00:03:15.750> a<00:03:15.780> long<00:03:15.810> time<00:03:16.140> so<00:03:16.350> it's<00:03:16.380> just<00:03:16.590> like<00:03:16.680> okay

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.069 
him a long time so it's just like okay
screw<00:03:17.340> it<00:03:17.430> so<00:03:17.850> you<00:03:18.329> can<00:03:18.480> jump<00:03:18.690> onto<00:03:18.959> these

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:19.079 
screw it so you can jump onto these

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:21.289 
screw it so you can jump onto these
things<00:03:19.350> apparently<00:03:19.590> and<00:03:20.040> not<00:03:20.549> die<00:03:20.820> these

00:03:21.289 --> 00:03:21.299 
things apparently and not die these

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:23.810 
things apparently and not die these
little<00:03:21.480> pieces<00:03:21.750> of<00:03:21.959> crap<00:03:22.769> I<00:03:23.040> was<00:03:23.400> surprised

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:23.820 
little pieces of crap I was surprised

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:25.430 
little pieces of crap I was surprised
when<00:03:24.030> he<00:03:24.090> didn't<00:03:24.690> hit<00:03:24.780> the<00:03:24.900> kill<00:03:25.079> ball<00:03:25.230> but

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
when he didn't hit the kill ball but

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:26.870 
when he didn't hit the kill ball but
yeah<00:03:25.799> you<00:03:25.920> can<00:03:25.950> jump<00:03:26.220> on<00:03:26.310> those<00:03:26.459> and<00:03:26.670> not<00:03:26.760> die

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
yeah you can jump on those and not die

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.420 
yeah you can jump on those and not die

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:21.780 
I guess you kind of landed on it but I

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:23.390 
I guess you kind of landed on it but I
don't<00:04:22.050> know<00:04:22.110> he<00:04:22.410> just<00:04:22.440> wanted<00:04:22.980> to<00:04:23.100> do<00:04:23.220> that<00:04:23.370> i

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:23.400 
don't know he just wanted to do that i

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:24.650 
don't know he just wanted to do that i
guess<00:04:23.640> but<00:04:23.820> now<00:04:23.940> you're<00:04:24.060> gonna<00:04:24.150> launch<00:04:24.450> off

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:24.660 
guess but now you're gonna launch off

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:26.600 
guess but now you're gonna launch off
that<00:04:24.870> little<00:04:25.020> thing<00:04:25.290> and<00:04:25.500> you<00:04:26.100> can<00:04:26.220> jump<00:04:26.430> out

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610 
that little thing and you can jump out

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:28.340 
that little thing and you can jump out
before<00:04:27.030> it<00:04:27.090> hits<00:04:27.270> just<00:04:27.480> in<00:04:27.630> case<00:04:27.780> it<00:04:27.900> explodes

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:28.350 
before it hits just in case it explodes

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:30.680 
before it hits just in case it explodes
but<00:04:28.680> it<00:04:29.070> didn't<00:04:29.280> explode<00:04:29.490> there<00:04:29.760> now<00:04:30.300> what<00:04:30.570> you

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:30.690 
but it didn't explode there now what you

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:32.300 
but it didn't explode there now what you
can<00:04:30.840> do<00:04:30.960> is<00:04:31.020> grab<00:04:31.260> the<00:04:31.470> armor<00:04:31.920> lock<00:04:32.070> in<00:04:32.220> the

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:32.310 
can do is grab the armor lock in the

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:34.310 
can do is grab the armor lock in the
corner<00:04:32.700> and<00:04:32.850> then<00:04:33.120> jump<00:04:33.450> up<00:04:33.600> onto<00:04:33.870> this<00:04:34.080> little

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:34.320 
corner and then jump up onto this little

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:35.720 
corner and then jump up onto this little
ledge<00:04:34.500> here<00:04:34.740> without<00:04:34.890> falling<00:04:35.310> off<00:04:35.430> because

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:35.730 
ledge here without falling off because

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:37.810 
ledge here without falling off because
that'd<00:04:35.850> be<00:04:36.000> a<00:04:36.030> fail<00:04:36.240> and<00:04:36.510> then<00:04:37.170> knock<00:04:37.470> the

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:37.820 
that'd be a fail and then knock the

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:40.880 
that'd be a fail and then knock the
mongoose<00:04:38.820> off<00:04:39.000> through<00:04:39.210> the<00:04:39.240> wall<00:04:39.590> and<00:04:40.590> he<00:04:40.740> has

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:40.890 
mongoose off through the wall and he has
