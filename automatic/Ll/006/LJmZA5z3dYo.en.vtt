00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.380
 and very good to all the boys and girls 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.210
 welcome to a new sales video and 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.340
 welcome to a new video with yus 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.230
 we are again in the pp and today you 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.740
 I want to teach two aspects the aspect 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:15.389
 secondary queens and value which is 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.199
 this aspect of queens 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:20.730
 phoenix as you see it completely red 

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:23.130
 and the aspect a new aspect that has 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.420
 put to soracá on celestial I think that 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.490
 it's called that I have the opportunity to 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.340
 see it so we'll see how it is 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.170
 this aspect of queens in phoenix suffers 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.759
 a change in all your particles like 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.100
 it's been normal and current as 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.440
 we see here have you say the 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.370
 characterization of being like a bird 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.110
 phoenix 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.450
 once he dies we do not have now what 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.160
 I'll show you I'll kill myself in the tower to 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.110
 that you see that while I'm going to teach the 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.780
 rest of queens skills see how 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:51.530
 have one more look of fire look what 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.440
 cool the chick 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:55.510
 or that did not arrive 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.890
 I'm going to commit suicide so you can see it 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:57.910
 that everything is fine and look now 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:00.300
 when I die is the best 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:04.780
 practically character 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:06.220
 you will not be born from my ashes 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:08.010
 the truth that as a secondary aspect 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:10.920
 it's very good 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.869
 even if we say that the section of 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.049
 the particle section is not that what 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:19.560
 have retouched at all as you see is a 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:21.869
 quite simple retouching in terms of its 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.330
 position there is much debate about where 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.670
 It should be if it should be on tops and 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.530
 should be in bots and should I go 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:32.640
 I could have some option in mid 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:35.580
 I personally see my opinion 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.229
 both in voice and top top though 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:39.780
 do not have the ability of their 31 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.640
 Pretty enough skills 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.729
 acceptable to be impossible to catch 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:47.039
 we have the e has a CD a bit 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.330
 elevated 10 seconds but well placed 

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:49.950
 together with the flash 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:52.770
 and the good position that the new 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.750
 mission that gives us the w allows us 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.909
 avoid practically all kinds of gangs 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:00.090
 and uncomfortable situations 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:03.720
 the last one is the ultimate to my way of 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:06.209
 see is much more useful in objectives 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:09.479
 individuals who in group battles do not 

00:02:06.209 --> 00:02:11.310
 I know I do not find him all that to 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.810
 this character in tim fain battles 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.519
 I see it badly as in ultimate as they have 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.930
 commented to finish killing 

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:18.500
 some enemy 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:22.040
 throwing us for someone 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:26.000
 or I do not really know 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:28.430
 I do not know, I do not finish seeing the value 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.109
 of his last in team size what 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:34.319
 that it is true that at the moment its damage 

00:02:30.109 --> 00:02:37.129
 the combo with the little bird goes overboard 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:39.900
 we throw ourselves is to throw the bird 

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:42.030
 we throw the e to reach the enemy or 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.950
 we do not send the bird we throw the cv 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:47.310
 thank you taking advantage of our bus 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:49.200
 speed that gives us 80% we throw the q 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.239
 in case the enemy already useful the 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.219
 we throw the l loose the r and 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:55.340
 then we can continue with our 

00:02:53.219 --> 00:02:59.519
 combo no longer in the thing does not continue there 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:01.469
 as for the combo ml it's basically 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:04.680
 this wait for value to mark some 

00:03:01.469 --> 00:03:07.500
 enemy for example if you mark an enemy 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:09.060
 you 'll instantly threw the q 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.939
 we paste note that we throw the one that 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:13.680
 redials and so the way it is 

00:03:11.939 --> 00:03:16.500
 quite effective with a mana expense 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:18.299
 laughable and a lot a lot much damage the the 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:20.629
 have had to leave for the moment 

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:24.500
 be a little bit from the first version 

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:26.300
 because it is very beast or 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:28.700
 the slow that was very big and the 

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:30.980
 energy where the first is what I was doing 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:32.990
 the 70 already have done 50 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:35.270
 cent so it's not so to earn me 

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:37.700
 so much attention that fixed we have them 

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:39.140
 here let's say we cultivate the grass 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:41.120
 It is also that it already takes a lot of 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:43.700
 giles and such but you understand not 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:45.320
 you see me the bus that I tell you we are going to do 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:46.910
 the vactor that does not show it in the video 

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:48.380
 of presentation and the truth that does not have 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:50.900
 no waste set the character 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:52.190
 aesthetically there is something that does not end 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:53.930
 to convince that they have those colors 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:55.610
 too matt too dark that 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:57.709
 it seems that all plastic is not no 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:59.690
 finish calling the character itself 

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:02.480
 but the idea itself 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:04.459
 the idea of ​​the character is very well the 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:05.680
 little bird where is it has not disappeared 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:08.630
 no this 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:11.330
 in the beginning, the bird is resting 

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:12.709
 to see where he was there not what 

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:14.850
 forget appears down here 

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:17.790
 often book 

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:19.650
 good that's all with you'll watch 

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:22.290
 the splicers because they are also good 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:24.450
 put this this is an empty space 

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:26.250
 where I speak without you 

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:29.780
 listen you see the images exposed in 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:29.780
 the fund I hope you liked it 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:35.690
 your heavenly cow and we're back 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:41.110
 with the celestial boat the truth is that 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:42.940
 this aspect looks brutal 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:46.090
 to start the authors have been retouched 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:50.630
 all you notice that it has an ace and a shore 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:52.910
 heavenly or rather pretty cool 

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:54.620
 it's a totally forgotten character today 

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:56.540
 in day after season 2 was a 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:57.890
 character practically more huff than 

00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:00.260
 had to have it yes or yes it's pretty 

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:02.570
 useful as cheap support and above is 

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:06.110
 very important skills glider 

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:07.970
 note that they have retouched it perfectly 

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:09.620
 all the w is totally spectacular 

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:12.550
 fixed because I 'm going to approach only 

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:15.980
 so you can see it standing still 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:17.780
 the moment that is taking away is brutal 

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:20.240
 partially the shield when it's finished 

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:23.390
 our the effect of the passive and what 

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:25.000
 say of the thing is very nice to see if 

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:26.650
 they go to benzema 

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.520
 the aspect of this I suppose that will be worth 

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:34.050
 of the typical 975 points I do not think that 

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:36.000
 I need to be worth more I do not see it 

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:37.620
 and I do not have to see the last one and not the 

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.080
 I've seen so we're going to pulse this from 

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:42.860
 here to do with killing like that they're going to 

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:42.860
 they are going to kill you 

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:49.920
 they carry 

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:49.920
 we get cured we throw ourselves the last 

00:05:49.969 --> 00:05:54.649
 great is not quite good and now 

00:05:52.549 --> 00:05:58.069
 let's go teach the back that also 

00:05:54.649 --> 00:06:00.589
 it is worthy of a cartoon 

00:05:58.069 --> 00:06:01.339
 position yourself well around here think it is 

00:06:00.589 --> 00:06:07.149
 pretty good 

00:06:01.339 --> 00:06:07.149
 set or five days ago 

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:12.510
 Amen, Hallelujah 

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:13.980
 what is the repetition mode that 

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:16.410
 as you see here the top corner 

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:19.050
 left next to the parrot and the 

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:20.430
 story appeared a new tab that 

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:21.930
 When you click this, do not pay attention 

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:24.240
 this is what they give you the pp that they give you 

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:27.810
 all the champions et cetera etcetera a 

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:29.760
 specific day this here is what 

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:31.889
 he said of the repetitions all the 

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:35.150
 repetitions that you see are kept here 

00:06:31.889 --> 00:06:37.500
 and in principle to those that you want 

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:38.580
 save me statistics are saved 

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:40.290
 all there are all the replays 

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:42.090
 that you have seen are saved here and the 

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:44.729
 you can repeat again to see without 

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:47.100
 need to go and find the person who 

00:06:44.729 --> 00:06:49.979
 I had had to that game or get you 

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:52.800
 same in your record of games as 

00:06:49.979 --> 00:06:54.090
 you see centrals in the match and it appears 

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:55.590
 here your record of games 

00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:58.200
 clinics in any of your hours 

00:06:55.590 --> 00:07:00.030
 if you put watch replay I do not want to see 

00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:02.330
 mine and I want to see pepito of the 

00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:04.069
 palotes 

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:06.379
 go allows the palotes is not 

00:07:04.069 --> 00:07:08.449
 found does not exist then you put the 

00:07:06.379 --> 00:07:09.889
 user that I really like I think 

00:07:08.449 --> 00:07:11.240
 that works with all we are going to look for 

00:07:09.889 --> 00:07:13.340
 ocelot because only that there is some 

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:15.020
 that the nickname has been created 12 lots etc 

00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:17.780
 He has not exactly played any game 

00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:20.840
 lately it's all the same to find 

00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:22.909
 someone who has played a game on 

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:25.939
 both professional player can be 

00:07:22.909 --> 00:07:27.680
 your friend your cousin or whoever is looking for it 

00:07:25.939 --> 00:07:29.599
 here you do not have it to the list of 

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:31.069
 friends please zoom to your list of 

00:07:29.599 --> 00:07:32.509
 matches and you can watch the replay and 

00:07:31.069 --> 00:07:35.150
 Once you have seen it, you are saved 

00:07:32.509 --> 00:07:37.719
 here to see them again all pc 

00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:40.550
 that gives you the point and balls is a 

00:07:37.719 --> 00:07:42.319
 quite important utility that I believe 

00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:45.460
 we will save more than one life 

00:07:42.319 --> 00:07:47.659
 especially because to me that I have 

00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:49.669
 tendency to make me big games that 

00:07:47.659 --> 00:07:51.379
 then I can never teach because it 

00:07:49.669 --> 00:07:53.629
 I screwed the clock the role record or the 

00:07:51.379 --> 00:07:55.639
 replay and I'm stupid 

00:07:53.629 --> 00:07:56.810
 so well this has been all I hope 

00:07:55.639 --> 00:07:58.789
 of boys and girls I hope that I have 

00:07:56.810 --> 00:08:00.940
 liked and see you in the next up 

00:07:58.789 --> 00:08:00.940
 then
