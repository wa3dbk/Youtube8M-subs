00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:13.980
 Today we will study the process of erosion of volcanic materials in 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.780
 Tongariro National Park is located on the North Central Island of New Zealand. 

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:24.600
 Much of the northern island of New Zealand has been built by volcanoes. 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.590
 These have been slowly modified over time by agents 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.340
 Of water, ice and wind. 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.080
 At Tongariro National Park these operations are most active at high altitudes 

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:45.023
 Where the vegetation is unable to protect the sharp ash covered with volcanic slopes of the weather. 

00:00:45.023 --> 00:00:49.760
 First let's look at the corrosion capacity of the wind. 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:54.829
 In this landscape volcanic wind is the most corrosive mountain tops 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:58.740
 Where strong winds become more frequent and stronger 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:06.619
 East mountains in the desert Rangipo where less precipitation and ash deposits quickly dry out. 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.300
 This allows Eulian Corrosion and transport to take place. 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:17.331
 A block of nami grass only gives the soil no protection in this environment. 

00:01:17.331 --> 00:01:23.091
 In some parts of the desert Rangipo these deposits were blown ash in the sand dunes. 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:29.140
 Winds in this area also distribute ash during volcanic eruptions. 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.310
 Because the prevailing winds are western, the ash deposits are the greatest east of the mountains. 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:42.000
 In the last revolutions the ash spread northeast to the Bay of Plenty the region. 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:49.140
 Another corrosion agent in this scene is water running which weakens easily 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.657
 Loose volcanic materials such as ash, tevra and ignimbrite. 

00:01:53.657 --> 00:01:57.938
 The effect of running water is greatest at higher altitudes 

00:01:57.938 --> 00:02:04.500
 Where rainfall is heavier than it is, the slopes are tougher and the surface of the earth is unprotected by plants. 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:09.840
 Heavy rain may cause a mass movement of ash from the flooded slopes. 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:17.580
 Precipitation stored on winter snow melts to run in rivers during drier summer months. 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.960
 These rivers carry decaying materials and eventually deposit them. 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.400
 These rivers journey towards the sea. 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:30.100
 Some debris reaches the sea. 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:38.330
 For example, Iron Sand from the west coast of North Island originates from Mount Taranaki. 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:44.460
 High melt ice in the mountains eventually form small streams. 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.630
 These small tables like this one will eventually flow into larger streams 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:56.500
 And eventually will make their way into the great rivers throughout this volcanic landscape, 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.400
 Such as Tongariro and the Wanganui River. 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:09.350
 High mountain rivers cut down to the surface of the earth carved from deep valleys and valleys. 

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:15.540
 Lava is harder and more resistant to water corrosion. 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:22.400
 A river transversing above the soft rock layer has the highest corrosion rate of the other area 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.200
 With a solid rock layer such as a lava flow. 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:31.040
 Over time the continuous erosion of the rock softer 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:34.780
 Lead to the slope of the river after the end of the lava flow. 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:42.250
 As the bed gets deeper stream, the stream speed also increases so 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:45.248
 Increase the strength of corrosion currents. 

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.489
 Eventually the rapids will become 

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:51.400
 Vertical leading to the formation of the waterfall. 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:56.500
 The base where the land is called a waterfall is a bathtub. 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.380
 Soft rock layers directly under the hard 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:02.459
 In rocks is undermining the creation of burden. 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:07.740
 Eventually the hard rock dangling becomes unstable due to the undermining process 

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:10.604
 Where they may collapse and retreat. 

00:04:10.604 --> 00:04:14.500
 There are many waterfalls around Mount Ruapehu 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:17.500
 Such as Mangawhero Falls, 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:19.554
 Press Falls 

00:04:19.554 --> 00:04:22.220
 And Taranaki Falls. 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:26.900
 They are all formed at the end of lava flows. 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:37.000
 I stand here in Taranaki Falls.This waterfall sinks at the end of the lava flow of Mount Ruapehu. 

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:45.540
 Further downstream rushing water leads to eroding away soft banks that are made up of 

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:52.380
 Volcanic ash and tephra. The softer material corrode much easier than 

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:55.080
 The solid volcanic rocks we see behind me. 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:03.300
 The erosion has stripped the soft tifra hills leaving the lava flows down the hard valley bedrock stranded ridge. 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:09.620
 For example, Pinnacle set on Mount Ruapehu. 

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:26.140
 Avalanches are another factor of erosion on Mount Ruapehu. 

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:33.300
 In 2007 the walls of the Ruapehu volcano were breached, and the generation of Lahar. 

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:37.240
 Its sweep down the mountain valleys of the Whangaehu River is a wide collection 

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:41.320
 Quantities of debris loose to deposit downstream. 

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:48.300
 Where I am now is a toilet block site that was located here in Tangiwai. 

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:59.600
 In about 2007 when the river swept down the Whangahehu River, the toilet block was actually expelled from this place and pulled a stream. 

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:05.520
 River erosion has been modified human activities, 

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:07.900
 Mainly from Tongariro power system 

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:12.870
 Natural rivers have been converted which means in man-made canals and blocked dams. 

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:17.600
 This reduces the natural occurring corrosion that will take the downstream place. 

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:23.560
 The diversion of rivers and dams even led to some expansion 

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:26.580
 Lakes such as Lake Rotoaira. 

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:31.220
 Finally, there is the corrosion effect of ice. 

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:35.920
 In many parts of the park frost can happen all year round. 

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:42.300
 During the winter, the ice needles penetrate through soil particles taking soil with them, 

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:48.430
 As can be seen here in the desert Rangipo. As the temperature rises during the day 

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:52.600
 These collapse pillars cause particles to roll down. 

00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:00.570
 In the winter the snow level extends to an average of 1,500 meters above sea level. 

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.720
 Storage is also getting snow in the cracks in the rocks at high altitudes. 

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:12.040
 Freezing and thawing operations take place that may cause the rocks to crack or even break away. 

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:18.320
 At the top of Mount Ruapehu mountain temperatures are often below zero 

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:21.180
 There is permanent ice in the form of small glaciers. 

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:25.729
 Glaciers eat huge amounts of material 

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.700
 Create U-shaped valleys. 

00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:33.938
 They move and deposit the debris on the sides, ground, and station of the glacier. 

00:07:33.938 --> 00:07:39.680
 These deposits form hills of loose rock fragments called moraine. 

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:42.500
 The valley of Mangetepopo at the base of Mount Tongarero 

00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:51.330
 Which has a distinctive U shape due to the old glaciers which no longer exist.
