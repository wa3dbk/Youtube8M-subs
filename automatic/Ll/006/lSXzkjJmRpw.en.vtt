00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:19.010
 What's reading for you? 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:32.570
 reading to me is synonymous with friendship 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:35.899
 understanding of 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:38.870
 courage and courage also reading to 

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:41.750
 I really do have the courage to 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:44.390
 see the world through the eyes of several 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:47.479
 characters is like traveling between 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:50.629
 worlds without leaving a shelter place 

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:52.760
 strengthening peace 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:55.510
 reading also means using the 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:58.430
 good things have to them entertainment 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:00.619
 learning creativity the ability 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:03.350
 to travel to various places without 

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:05.299
 Sorry to leave the money does not leave the place 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:06.860
 reading to me is a way that I 

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:07.520
 I found myself running away from all my 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.920
 problems 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.930
 the way I carry it to a 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.270
 totally different world and can be 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:16.960
 The greenest suit is for me to see the 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:19.280
 world from other perspectives 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:22.159
 reading for me is a refuge when the 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:24.409
 world all touch a problem and I open 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:26.270
 a book I stop living all mine 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:28.399
 problems to escape to that 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:30.290
 Reading reality for me to can go to 

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:30.829
 anywhere in the world without leaving my 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:32.810
 room 

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:34.820
 reading to me is among many things 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:37.310
 understand that the world does not revolve around 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:40.370
 From my belly button to reading to me, it's you. 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:42.560
 travel the world without leaving your place 

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:44.990
 everything to me is a friend that many 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:47.030
 times if it comes together that they will do 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:49.280
 company when there's no one on the 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:53.060
 reading in my life 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:56.030
 the part that relaxes the site sega and the part 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:57.440
 that allows me to see on other worlds 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.840
 literature and the world that people 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:02.180
 can choose any reality goes 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:06.200
 to want to live the reading for me this time 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:08.349
 it is the magic that unites my real to the surreal 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.500
 and it takes me to worlds completely 

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:11.750
 unknown 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.849
 reading for me is a world where several 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:16.640
 people can connect the 

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:19.970
 Readers send friends and everything else 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:22.340
 Above all, reading is e 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:24.230
 experience you can use a 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.120
 book but I think the character is 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:28.490
 falling there and learning to take our 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:30.170
 life identify 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:32.360
 the world where we can not live in the 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:34.730
 reality a survey 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:37.070
 so for me reading experience and 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:39.830
 learning and connecting in the dictionary 

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:41.600
 means to know and interpret 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:44.510
 half of reading but I particularly 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:46.760
 I think it goes well beyond that the law is 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:48.590
 discovering the essential is completely 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:51.470
 invisible to the eye and see that everything 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:53.990
 you have to be here, your imagination 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:56.570
 and various symbols and words he created 

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:58.250
 a rosy parallel world that you can 

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:59.960
 Miss the time you want 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:01.670
 It's like a haven you forget. 

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:03.680
 everything you can be whatever you want 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:05.420
 you can be a superman you can 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:08.240
 being can be anywhere in 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:11.690
 any time the reading for me is a 

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:14.870
 way of knowing new places 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:17.450
 even if they are fictitious for me to 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:19.790
 my head it's real places that 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:22.130
 most of the time 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:24.950
 reading for me is a way of saying if 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:27.290
 the joys and dreams events 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:30.860
 sorrows and experiencing millions of 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:32.270
 several lives and with that the strike is good 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:34.190
 the reading for me besides being 

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:36.230
 simply one of the riches of the 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:38.120

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:38.750
