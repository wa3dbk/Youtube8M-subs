fun<00:00:31.669> the<00:00:32.669> reason<00:00:33.000> he's<00:00:33.120> so<00:00:33.300> big<00:00:33.570> is<00:00:33.930> because

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:34.070 
fun the reason he's so big is because

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:36.680

the<00:00:52.710> DNA<00:00:53.160> of<00:00:53.370> the<00:00:53.520> wild<00:00:53.879> pig<00:00:54.120> and<00:00:54.420> they

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
the DNA of the wild pig and they

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.930 
the DNA of the wild pig and they
genetically<00:00:55.379> engineered<00:00:56.010> it<00:00:56.190> to<00:00:56.610> create<00:00:56.910> a

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
big very fast so they can go to

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.009 
big very fast so they can go to
slaughter<00:01:01.710> when<00:01:01.980> they're<00:01:02.070> only<00:01:02.280> 6<00:01:02.550> months<00:01:02.699> old

when we rescue them from slaughter they

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.340 
when we rescue them from slaughter they
keep<00:01:05.670> growing<00:01:06.150> until<00:01:06.180> 3<00:01:06.750> like<00:01:07.170> they're

4 because nature never intended them to

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.289 
4 because nature never intended them to
be<00:01:21.000> this<00:01:21.330> big<00:01:21.740> with<00:01:22.740> biskits<00:01:23.310> he's<00:01:23.670> extremely

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
be this big with biskits he's extremely

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.570 
be this big with biskits he's extremely
dedicated<00:01:24.630> and<00:01:25.229> disciplined<00:01:25.350> and<00:01:26.009> every

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
dedicated and disciplined and every

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.490 
dedicated and disciplined and every
single<00:01:26.820> solitary<00:01:27.150> day<00:01:27.750> since<00:01:28.080> the<00:01:28.170> day<00:01:28.200> we<00:01:28.470> got

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
single solitary day since the day we got

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.530 
single solitary day since the day we got
him<00:01:28.829> he<00:01:29.340> wakes<00:01:29.520> up<00:01:29.670> at<00:01:29.820> 6:30<00:01:30.270> in<00:01:30.360> the<00:01:30.450> morning

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
him he wakes up at 6:30 in the morning

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.420 
him he wakes up at 6:30 in the morning
and<00:01:30.960> he<00:01:31.020> goes<00:01:31.140> jogging<00:01:31.619> around<00:01:31.740> the<00:01:31.950> barnyard

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
and he goes jogging around the barnyard

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.999 
and he goes jogging around the barnyard
and<00:01:32.610> I<00:01:33.180> think<00:01:33.420> that<00:01:33.600> discipline<00:01:34.200> coupled<00:01:34.950> with

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
and I think that discipline coupled with

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.980 
and I think that discipline coupled with
a<00:01:35.159> very<00:01:35.220> restricted<00:01:35.939> diet<00:01:36.150> we've<00:01:36.720> been<00:01:36.869> able

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
a very restricted diet we've been able

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.899 
a very restricted diet we've been able
to<00:01:37.170> make<00:01:37.650> him<00:01:37.799> live<00:01:37.979> a<00:01:38.009> long<00:01:38.250> time<00:01:38.549> we<00:01:38.880> just

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
to make him live a long time we just

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.630 
to make him live a long time we just
celebrated<00:01:39.600> his<00:01:39.720> ninth<00:01:39.990> birthday<00:01:40.140> and<00:01:40.799> if

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
celebrated his ninth birthday and if

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.219 
celebrated his ninth birthday and if
we're<00:01:41.820> really<00:01:42.060> lucky<00:01:42.479> we'll<00:01:42.990> get<00:01:43.140> to
