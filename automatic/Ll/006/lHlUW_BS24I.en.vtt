00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:03.770
 hello everyone and welcome to Sylvie skateboard type skateboard 

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:08.019
 so literally that means saving the sheep soldier 

00:00:08.549 --> 00:00:10.589
 so that in the middle of the USSR 

00:00:10.589 --> 00:00:14.019
 to the film you have to save the soldier true friends full of a whole year 

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:16.550
 so in fact these young people 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:18.869
 in fact it's really want 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.319
 four years ago for 5 management-based 

00:00:22.319 --> 00:00:25.689
 of physics not the objects and the python then 

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:29.999
 in the mouth more you want what I found that it 

00:00:29.999 --> 00:00:33.500
 with a time as a new international high school in boxer 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.620
 in fact it is the sheep that have controlled well 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.820
 but in fact we two cases we must help the sheep reach the mainland 

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:43.750
 45 pieces 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:47.460
 so tonight it's extremely hard for the locals who falls 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:50.570
 leaving level 1 in fact 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:53.160
 the jury has four levels 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.440
 so as you see here game 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.990
 I did it so it will be 73% of the levels so I try to get on top 

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:01.190
 of the lot 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:05.489
 to get rich relative between the two groups according to the speed osdh 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.480
 to which you ended at a level 

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:10.480
 it's also the number of documents you used 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:13.950
 no need for a longer or shorter period 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.850
 a value more or less important 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:18.850
 we see that it's still woman I did not break my head 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:22.670
 but I still have 40 gold medals loop the game is 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:24.310
 relatively easy 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:27.310
 I will come back but for me it's one of the little flaws of the game 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:31.130
 amf found here the levels are shown on a map 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:35.320
 to the fact that the magic sure 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:36.549
 on multiple cards 

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:39.549
 we will take hazard 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:45.220
 so the feast and the difficulties that is 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:47.090
 announced as possible 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.410
 so in fact the amount is here 

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:52.110
 but she tells him I know how to remove it 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.910
 here on the mainland 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:57.580
 that's why you have bad luck main is your finger 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:00.160
 and that was granted 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:03.190
 spaces devolving therefore to the idea that it is hard 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:05.140
 so there for example 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:06.600
 gfr 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.249
 exposed to tesla 

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:12.309
 that's why it's buggies 

00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:14.029
 sheep 

00:02:14.029 --> 00:02:15.539
 the next few weeks of 

00:02:15.539 --> 00:02:16.979
 cross 

00:02:16.979 --> 00:02:19.119
 but we must be able to reclassify doubting 

00:02:19.119 --> 00:02:20.050
 so for example 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:23.050
 I'm going to do something again 

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:28.309
 copÃ© place 

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:34.199
 so we can see that there was a little more 

00:02:35.279 --> 00:02:38.279
 but the timing is still relatively accurate 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:45.429
 we passed level exceeded earlier 

00:02:45.429 --> 00:02:47.899
 of the reflection of the times of the timing 

00:02:47.899 --> 00:02:50.579
 because it's big it's third of the seals of the islands 

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:53.859
 the sheep that are actually mounted are not sheep but are 

00:02:53.859 --> 00:02:54.759
 wolves 

00:02:54.759 --> 00:02:57.839
 so this against the new boss of the port 

00:02:57.839 --> 00:03:00.269
 they are slightly different in terms of graphics 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:03.749
 so you do not need Ferralais on the closed theme 

00:03:03.749 --> 00:03:06.969
 this is the make sure that they who dies by falling to the side by 

00:03:06.969 --> 00:03:08.199
 example 

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:10.899
 so the meal of the elders 

00:03:10.899 --> 00:03:13.899
 a level that starts from the most complete 

00:03:16.539 --> 00:03:19.379
 - in this case I have the field of luck 

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:22.070
 all of this in one shot I managed to the show 

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:24.639
 a third gold medal 

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:27.609
 korhogo has as well as the wish of small texts 

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:30.759
 it's usually everything that gives you orders 

00:03:30.759 --> 00:03:33.349
 state of origin 

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:35.939
 the graphics are without entering khartoum 

00:03:35.939 --> 00:03:39.359
 and as I said then what I had announced the games on each other on the 

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:40.219
 blog 

00:03:40.219 --> 00:03:42.430
 it swallows I'm close anyway a lot of 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:45.089
 like you kids 

00:03:45.089 --> 00:03:49.149
 camelot different enough to be interesting what in the camp 

00:03:49.149 --> 00:03:52.569
 English in a platoon launched catapulted with painful episodes 

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:54.729
 with one of his lovers to please 

00:03:54.729 --> 00:03:56.799
 it's longer 

00:03:56.799 --> 00:03:59.189
 it's a little more the cityville game 

00:03:59.189 --> 00:04:00.909
 and for 100 m 

00:04:00.909 --> 00:04:03.909
 there is no sheep catapulted suddenly 

00:04:04.619 --> 00:04:07.159
 according to the physics management that counts 

00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:10.469
 while this is not necessarily the case in caves 

00:04:10.469 --> 00:04:11.679
 rens 

00:04:11.679 --> 00:04:15.159
 so much at the level of average levels to four in all 

00:04:15.159 --> 00:04:17.979
 she struts they have that little 

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:20.599
 what I was saying is that the game still relatively easy as a 

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:22.509
 ball and you have some shopping 

00:04:22.509 --> 00:04:26.060
 for typical men is that 11 years old no matter what I pressed on a 

00:04:26.059 --> 00:04:27.080
 piece 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:29.509
 I won at the European level actually 

00:04:29.509 --> 00:04:31.749
 it's something that says 

00:04:31.749 --> 00:04:33.930
 if we leave often it is that 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:36.909
 we see that it is a solution that the expenses for developers 

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:39.909
 we are often around it more or less 

00:04:41.349 --> 00:04:44.809
 more people once in less than an hour less good 

00:04:44.809 --> 00:04:46.729
 so that parents 

00:04:46.729 --> 00:04:49.830
 by taking you to the container ship anyway 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:53.789
 so the network to another weekend xena level I stopped 

00:04:54.879 --> 00:04:57.830
 so we'll say it gets complicated by Christmas 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:00.830
 our communities 

00:05:01.779 --> 00:05:05.099
 for a long time the mambok was wrong 

00:05:05.099 --> 00:05:07.110
 of this project of his teammate 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:10.110
 oracle 

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:22.919
 so here it is place the small goals nice music 

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:24.479
 the mans gp 

00:05:24.479 --> 00:05:25.610
 his idea 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:28.560
 and comb through and the social network that integrated them with 

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:30.509
 share scores are rare 

00:05:30.509 --> 00:05:33.099
 fighting with his friends 

00:05:33.099 --> 00:05:35.460
 two elements of 2 0 39 

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:37.509
 so that's why more 

00:05:37.509 --> 00:05:39.879
 for me it's a little bit expensive 

00:05:39.879 --> 00:05:42.969
 one day we always have the comparison with a single hose offers 

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:45.830
 more than 120 levels I believe 

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:48.830
 r are 19 cents on the shoot that is 

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:52.430
 the press somewhat more expensive and which offers - level 

00:05:53.249 --> 00:05:56.059
 So here we go 

00:05:56.059 --> 00:05:59.189
 that conclude pretty quickly I think you have 

00:05:59.189 --> 00:06:00.759
 a perceived giver of the game 

00:06:00.759 --> 00:06:03.529
 in this tournament will be thrilled 

00:06:03.529 --> 00:06:04.370
 a good game 

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:07.349
 yes but you deserve 

00:06:07.349 --> 00:06:09.059
 to be 

00:06:09.059 --> 00:06:11.349
 already cheaper than expected 

00:06:11.349 --> 00:06:14.460
 in addition to having levels that are still 

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:15.710
 a bit more 

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:17.879
 that we build 

00:06:17.879 --> 00:06:20.919
 no more to make more important players maybe he would have put in 

00:06:20.919 --> 00:06:21.729
 day 

00:06:21.729 --> 00:06:24.699
 which will bring additional levels of 

00:06:24.699 --> 00:06:26.180
 the jets none 

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:28.029
 the name for the port holder 

00:06:28.029 --> 00:06:31.029
 from the publisher I can promise you 

00:06:32.569 --> 00:06:35.649
 and a massive should you have a maintenance and maintenance 

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:40.150
 at the same time I think I prefer to play on the left 

00:06:41.069 --> 00:06:44.559
 already by its auction price and then 

00:06:44.559 --> 00:06:48.269
 they will already be of equivalent quality by trying to give 

00:06:48.269 --> 00:06:50.619
 some key graphics star 

00:06:50.619 --> 00:06:52.509
 but after a speech 

00:06:52.509 --> 00:06:54.090
 who says play now 

00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:57.090
 six prices are not equivalent now we will take the cheapest 

00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:01.180
 This is what is true on the rankings of the Bceao 

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:04.369
 so that's what I want 

00:07:04.369 --> 00:07:07.369
 I'll give a score of 3,200 that out of 100 out of 5 

00:07:08.839 --> 00:07:10.619
 there will be more affordable 

00:07:10.619 --> 00:07:13.619
 at least four civilians caught in the fire the tcl 

00:07:14.509 --> 00:07:16.119
 and why not more than 6% 

00:07:16.119 --> 00:07:18.659
 already the level had been a little 

00:07:18.659 --> 00:07:20.889
 a little the builder 

00:07:20.889 --> 00:07:23.619
 we have no idea of ââthe levels any more 

00:07:23.619 --> 00:07:26.879
 a taller sized man since the volume on the screen will be open 

00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:30.830
 but it's really very limited 

00:07:32.770 --> 00:07:36.000
 it's really very limited so we can not have this problem 

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.849
 not working 

00:07:37.849 --> 00:07:39.710
 this is where 

00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:41.009
 thanks to them 

00:07:41.009 --> 00:07:44.309
 of your fidelity stone manent always do not hesitate to leave some 

00:07:44.309 --> 00:07:45.029
 comments 

00:07:45.029 --> 00:07:46.610
 they may encourage us to review
