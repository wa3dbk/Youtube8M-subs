brick<00:00:08.250> stitch<00:00:08.550> is<00:00:08.880> a<00:00:08.940> stitch<00:00:09.389> that<00:00:09.660> confused

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
brick stitch is a stitch that confused

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.499 
brick stitch is a stitch that confused
me<00:00:10.620> when<00:00:10.920> I<00:00:10.950> first<00:00:11.219> started<00:00:11.730> doing<00:00:12.120> beadwork

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
me when I first started doing beadwork

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:15.259 
me when I first started doing beadwork
because<00:00:13.259> when<00:00:14.099> you're<00:00:14.250> attaching<00:00:14.490> beads<00:00:15.030> to

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
because when you're attaching beads to

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.720 
because when you're attaching beads to
it<00:00:15.299> instead<00:00:15.809> of<00:00:15.929> going<00:00:16.470> through<00:00:16.500> the<00:00:17.070> beads<00:00:17.430> to

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
it instead of going through the beads to

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.580 
it instead of going through the beads to
attach<00:00:18.000> them<00:00:18.359> the<00:00:18.600> way<00:00:18.720> you<00:00:18.779> do<00:00:19.020> and<00:00:19.230> pretty

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
attach them the way you do and pretty

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.769 
attach them the way you do and pretty
much<00:00:19.820> well<00:00:20.820> I<00:00:20.850> shouldn't<00:00:21.210> say<00:00:21.270> every<00:00:21.660> other

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
much well I shouldn't say every other

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.009 
much well I shouldn't say every other
stitch<00:00:22.230> but<00:00:22.500> most<00:00:23.400> other<00:00:23.699> stitches<00:00:24.029> you're

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
stitch but most other stitches you're

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.470 
stitch but most other stitches you're
actually<00:00:25.410> attaching<00:00:25.949> by<00:00:26.430> looping<00:00:26.910> under<00:00:27.300> the

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
actually attaching by looping under the

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.560 
actually attaching by looping under the
thread<00:00:27.840> and<00:00:28.140> I<00:00:29.130> was<00:00:29.490> really<00:00:29.760> suspicious<00:00:30.119> of<00:00:30.420> it

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
thread and I was really suspicious of it

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:31.999 
thread and I was really suspicious of it
at<00:00:30.750> first<00:00:30.960> because<00:00:31.199> I<00:00:31.349> was<00:00:31.410> like<00:00:31.619> could<00:00:31.830> that

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
at first because I was like could that

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.150 
at first because I was like could that
really<00:00:32.160> be<00:00:32.279> strong<00:00:32.910> enough<00:00:33.270> to<00:00:33.870> stand<00:00:34.620> up<00:00:34.800> over

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
really be strong enough to stand up over

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.830 
really be strong enough to stand up over
the<00:00:35.250> long<00:00:35.430> haul<00:00:35.719> I<00:00:36.719> just<00:00:37.710> I<00:00:37.860> really<00:00:38.129> I<00:00:38.840> didn't

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
the long haul I just I really I didn't

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.600 
the long haul I just I really I didn't
like<00:00:40.170> brick<00:00:40.500> stitch<00:00:40.829> I'll<00:00:41.040> just<00:00:41.280> go<00:00:41.430> out<00:00:41.550> and

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
like brick stitch I'll just go out and

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.340 
like brick stitch I'll just go out and
say<00:00:41.850> it<00:00:41.879> I<00:00:42.059> just<00:00:42.120> didn't<00:00:42.600> plain<00:00:42.899> like<00:00:43.170> it

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
say it I just didn't plain like it

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.799 
say it I just didn't plain like it
because<00:00:43.530> I<00:00:43.620> just<00:00:43.829> it<00:00:44.160> confused<00:00:44.670> me<00:00:44.760> but<00:00:45.510> over

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
because I just it confused me but over

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.450 
because I just it confused me but over
time<00:00:46.079> brick<00:00:46.500> stitch<00:00:46.680> and<00:00:46.860> I<00:00:46.890> have<00:00:47.070> come<00:00:47.280> to

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
time brick stitch and I have come to

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.630 
time brick stitch and I have come to
terms<00:00:47.610> with<00:00:47.820> each<00:00:48.030> other<00:00:48.270> and<00:00:49.039> there<00:00:50.039> are<00:00:50.430> some

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
terms with each other and there are some

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.369 
terms with each other and there are some
really<00:00:50.789> good<00:00:50.969> use<00:00:51.180> reasons<00:00:51.780> to<00:00:51.930> use<00:00:51.960> brick

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
really good use reasons to use brick

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.180 
really good use reasons to use brick
stitch<00:00:52.620> one<00:00:53.309> of<00:00:53.460> which<00:00:53.670> is<00:00:54.059> that<00:00:54.829> it<00:00:55.829> gives<00:00:56.010> you

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
stitch one of which is that it gives you

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.209 
stitch one of which is that it gives you
the<00:00:56.219> peyote<00:00:56.760> look<00:00:57.180> in<00:00:57.449> that<00:00:57.750> the<00:00:58.260> beads<00:00:58.859> will

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
the peyote look in that the beads will

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.080 
the peyote look in that the beads will
be<00:00:59.370> offset<00:00:59.870> but<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:01.410> beads<00:01:01.620> will<00:01:01.829> be<00:01:01.949> at<00:01:02.100> going

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
be offset but the beads will be at going

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.329 
be offset but the beads will be at going
in<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:03.870> beat<00:01:04.049> the<00:01:04.199> holes<00:01:04.439> will<00:01:04.830> be<00:01:04.860> going<00:01:05.159> in<00:01:05.280> a

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
in the beat the holes will be going in a

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.399 
in the beat the holes will be going in a
different<00:01:05.640> direction<00:01:05.760> so<00:01:06.270> with<00:01:06.780> peyote<00:01:07.140> the

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
different direction so with peyote the

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.100 
different direction so with peyote the
holes<00:01:07.650> are<00:01:08.100> all<00:01:08.250> going<00:01:08.659> horizontally<00:01:09.659> but

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
holes are all going horizontally but

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.719 
holes are all going horizontally but
with<00:01:10.260> brick<00:01:10.530> stitch<00:01:10.860> you<00:01:11.070> get<00:01:11.189> the<00:01:11.310> same<00:01:11.490> look

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
with brick stitch you get the same look

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.250 
with brick stitch you get the same look
but<00:01:12.000> the<00:01:12.090> holes<00:01:12.270> are<00:01:12.479> all<00:01:12.570> going<00:01:12.869> vertically

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
but the holes are all going vertically

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.320 
but the holes are all going vertically
and<00:01:13.560> that<00:01:13.680> can<00:01:13.860> make<00:01:14.040> a<00:01:14.070> difference<00:01:14.670> in<00:01:14.970> your

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
and that can make a difference in your

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.859 
and that can make a difference in your
in<00:01:15.900> a<00:01:16.049> designer's<00:01:16.560> piece<00:01:17.450> getting<00:01:18.450> the<00:01:18.659> beads

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
in a designer's piece getting the beads

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.810 
in a designer's piece getting the beads
oriented<00:01:19.530> in<00:01:19.710> the<00:01:19.799> right<00:01:19.830> direction<00:01:20.130> can

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
oriented in the right direction can

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.450 
oriented in the right direction can
surprisingly<00:01:21.570> be<00:01:21.810> difficult<00:01:22.259> sometimes<00:01:22.460> so

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
surprisingly be difficult sometimes so

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:24.679 
surprisingly be difficult sometimes so
let<00:01:23.610> me<00:01:23.700> show<00:01:23.850> you<00:01:23.880> how<00:01:24.030> to<00:01:24.060> do<00:01:24.240> brick<00:01:24.450> stitch

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
let me show you how to do brick stitch

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.929 
let me show you how to do brick stitch
and<00:01:24.990> show<00:01:25.350> you<00:01:25.409> why<00:01:25.710> it<00:01:25.770> has<00:01:26.100> won<00:01:26.340> me<00:01:26.549> over

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
and show you why it has won me over

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:31.069 
and show you why it has won me over
let's<00:01:27.810> take<00:01:27.960> a<00:01:27.990> look<00:01:28.140> at<00:01:28.229> the<00:01:28.320> beads<00:01:30.079> I've

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
let's take a look at the beads I've

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:34.100 
let's take a look at the beads I've
started<00:01:31.439> out<00:01:31.680> here<00:01:32.159> with<00:01:32.810> creating<00:01:33.810> a<00:01:33.960> little

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
started out here with creating a little

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.160 
started out here with creating a little
ladder<00:01:34.380> stitch<00:01:34.829> of<00:01:35.159> beads<00:01:35.729> and<00:01:36.119> I've<00:01:36.810> already

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
ladder stitch of beads and I've already

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.560 
ladder stitch of beads and I've already
done<00:01:37.380> a<00:01:37.710> video<00:01:37.979> on<00:01:38.189> how<00:01:38.670> to<00:01:38.729> do<00:01:38.970> ladder<00:01:39.210> stitch

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
done a video on how to do ladder stitch

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.469 
done a video on how to do ladder stitch
so<00:01:39.900> if<00:01:40.079> you<00:01:40.229> need<00:01:40.530> to<00:01:41.520> know<00:01:41.640> how<00:01:41.820> to<00:01:41.850> do<00:01:42.030> that<00:01:42.240> I

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
so if you need to know how to do that I

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.899 
so if you need to know how to do that I
will<00:01:42.810> pop<00:01:43.140> a<00:01:43.170> link<00:01:43.500> up<00:01:43.680> here<00:01:44.009> for<00:01:44.310> you<00:01:44.520> to<00:01:44.759> go

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
will pop a link up here for you to go

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.050 
will pop a link up here for you to go
ahead<00:01:45.060> and<00:01:45.829> learn<00:01:46.829> that<00:01:47.100> first<00:01:47.490> and<00:01:47.759> then<00:01:47.850> come

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
ahead and learn that first and then come

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.429 
ahead and learn that first and then come
on<00:01:48.090> back<00:01:48.210> and<00:01:48.600> we'll<00:01:48.659> do<00:01:48.840> the<00:01:48.990> the<00:01:49.229> brick

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
on back and we'll do the the brick

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.560 
on back and we'll do the the brick
stitch<00:01:49.680> so<00:01:50.399> it<00:01:50.549> doesn't<00:01:50.880> matter<00:01:51.030> whether<00:01:51.329> this

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
stitch so it doesn't matter whether this

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.389 
stitch so it doesn't matter whether this
is<00:01:51.750> an<00:01:51.869> odd<00:01:52.020> number<00:01:52.470> or<00:01:52.500> an<00:01:52.860> even<00:01:53.130> number<00:01:53.369> of

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
is an odd number or an even number of

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.420 
is an odd number or an even number of
beads<00:01:53.670> you'll<00:01:53.970> just<00:01:54.210> create<00:01:54.659> this<00:01:54.899> however

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:55.430 
beads you'll just create this however

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:58.639 
beads you'll just create this however
long<00:01:56.430> you<00:01:56.759> need<00:01:56.790> it<00:01:57.149> with<00:01:57.570> your<00:01:57.960> ladder<00:01:58.290> stitch

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
pick up two beads and then what we're

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.220 
pick up two beads and then what we're
going<00:02:17.459> to<00:02:17.519> do<00:02:17.730> is<00:02:17.970> you've<00:02:18.299> got<00:02:18.329> these<00:02:18.750> threads

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
going to do is you've got these threads

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.110 
going to do is you've got these threads
and<00:02:19.680> here<00:02:20.280> I'm<00:02:20.370> going<00:02:20.489> to<00:02:20.549> kind<00:02:20.760> of<00:02:20.790> pull<00:02:21.000> this

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
and here I'm going to kind of pull this

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.210 
and here I'm going to kind of pull this
out<00:02:21.329> a<00:02:21.360> little<00:02:21.569> bit<00:02:21.840> so<00:02:22.650> that<00:02:22.680> you<00:02:22.829> can<00:02:22.950> see<00:02:23.129> it

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
out a little bit so that you can see it

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:24.259 
out a little bit so that you can see it
a<00:02:23.250> little<00:02:23.280> bit<00:02:23.579> better<00:02:23.730> but<00:02:23.939> there's<00:02:24.150> this

00:02:24.259 --> 00:02:24.269 
a little bit better but there's this

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:26.360 
a little bit better but there's this
thread<00:02:24.659> that's<00:02:24.959> sitting<00:02:25.500> right<00:02:25.920> along<00:02:26.220> this

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
thread that's sitting right along this

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.520 
thread that's sitting right along this
between<00:02:27.209> that's<00:02:27.599> holding<00:02:27.989> these<00:02:28.110> two<00:02:28.170> beads

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
between that's holding these two beads

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.679 
between that's holding these two beads
together<00:02:28.769> right<00:02:29.250> that's<00:02:29.970> the<00:02:30.209> thread<00:02:30.510> that

00:02:30.679 --> 00:02:30.689 
together right that's the thread that

00:02:30.689 --> 00:02:32.390 
together right that's the thread that
now<00:02:30.930> I'm<00:02:31.140> going<00:02:31.170> to<00:02:31.349> take<00:02:31.530> my<00:02:31.680> needle<00:02:31.890> and<00:02:32.220> I'm

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
now I'm going to take my needle and I'm

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.640 
now I'm going to take my needle and I'm
just<00:02:32.609> going<00:02:32.790> to<00:02:32.879> stick<00:02:33.329> my<00:02:33.659> needle<00:02:33.720> underneath

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
just going to stick my needle underneath

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.869 
just going to stick my needle underneath
that<00:02:34.890> thread<00:02:35.310> and<00:02:37.040> so<00:02:38.040> now<00:02:38.189> the<00:02:38.250> thread<00:02:38.640> that

00:02:38.869 --> 00:02:38.879 
that thread and so now the thread that

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:40.640 
that thread and so now the thread that
was<00:02:39.150> on<00:02:39.299> my<00:02:39.450> needle<00:02:39.840> is<00:02:40.079> now<00:02:40.319> looped

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
was on my needle is now looped

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:42.619 
was on my needle is now looped
underneath<00:02:41.159> the<00:02:41.370> thread<00:02:41.700> that<00:02:42.150> is<00:02:42.390> holding

00:02:42.619 --> 00:02:42.629 
underneath the thread that is holding

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:44.809 
underneath the thread that is holding
those<00:02:42.870> two<00:02:43.049> beads<00:02:43.260> together<00:02:43.500> I'm<00:02:44.459> going<00:02:44.760> to

00:02:44.809 --> 00:02:44.819 
those two beads together I'm going to

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:48.520 
those two beads together I'm going to
pop<00:02:45.060> right<00:02:45.390> back<00:02:45.450> up<00:02:45.870> through<00:02:46.709> the<00:02:47.129> very<00:02:47.549> first

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
pop right back up through the very first

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:55.220 
pop right back up through the very first
bead<00:02:49.530> that's<00:02:49.799> right<00:02:50.040> above<00:02:50.310> there<00:02:52.430> and<00:02:54.230> now

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
bead that's right above there and now

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.610 
bead that's right above there and now
that<00:02:55.440> just<00:02:55.620> connected<00:02:56.220> those<00:02:56.609> two<00:02:56.879> beads<00:02:57.620> to

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
that just connected those two beads to

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.160 
that just connected those two beads to
make<00:02:59.400> this<00:02:59.609> a<00:02:59.670> little<00:02:59.879> more<00:03:00.000> solid<00:03:00.659> what<00:03:01.049> you

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
make this a little more solid what you

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:04.399 
make this a little more solid what you
want<00:03:01.349> to<00:03:01.470> do<00:03:01.650> is<00:03:02.099> basically<00:03:03.090> go<00:03:03.599> around<00:03:03.959> in

00:03:04.399 --> 00:03:04.409 
want to do is basically go around in

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:06.559 
want to do is basically go around in
between<00:03:05.280> those<00:03:05.549> two<00:03:05.819> beads<00:03:06.060> in<00:03:06.299> the<00:03:06.389> knit<00:03:06.540> and

00:03:06.559 --> 00:03:06.569 
between those two beads in the knit and

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:09.830 
between those two beads in the knit and
the<00:03:06.870> new<00:03:07.049> row<00:03:07.260> and<00:03:07.530> that<00:03:08.250> will<00:03:08.549> help<00:03:09.329> solidify

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
the new row and that will help solidify

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.399 
the new row and that will help solidify
what's<00:03:10.470> going<00:03:10.769> on<00:03:10.920> up<00:03:11.340> there

00:03:12.399 --> 00:03:12.409 
what's going on up there

00:03:12.409 --> 00:03:15.920 
what's going on up there
all<00:03:13.409> right<00:03:13.680> and<00:03:13.950> then<00:03:14.489> for<00:03:14.760> the<00:03:14.849> rest<00:03:15.120> of<00:03:15.420> this

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
all right and then for the rest of this

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:17.330 
all right and then for the rest of this
row<00:03:16.230> you're<00:03:16.530> going<00:03:16.650> to<00:03:16.709> be<00:03:16.769> picking<00:03:17.040> up<00:03:17.129> one

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
row you're going to be picking up one

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.610 
row you're going to be picking up one
bead<00:03:17.549> at<00:03:17.579> a<00:03:17.730> time<00:03:18.030> so<00:03:18.840> now<00:03:19.019> to<00:03:19.079> add<00:03:19.260> my<00:03:19.560> next

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
bead at a time so now to add my next

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.490 
bead at a time so now to add my next
bead<00:03:20.040> I'm<00:03:20.220> picking<00:03:20.519> up<00:03:20.639> one<00:03:20.970> I'm<00:03:21.500> passing

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
bead I'm picking up one I'm passing

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.680 
bead I'm picking up one I'm passing
through<00:03:22.530> the<00:03:22.829> next<00:03:23.190> underneath<00:03:24.150> I<00:03:24.419> shouldn't

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
through the next underneath I shouldn't

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:26.900 
through the next underneath I shouldn't
say<00:03:24.810> through<00:03:25.109> underneath<00:03:25.590> that<00:03:25.949> next<00:03:26.519> thread

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
say through underneath that next thread

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:28.819 
say through underneath that next thread
intersection<00:03:27.660> right<00:03:27.810> there<00:03:28.079> so<00:03:28.620> it's<00:03:28.769> the

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:28.829 
intersection right there so it's the

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:30.710 
intersection right there so it's the
intersection<00:03:29.220> between<00:03:29.519> the<00:03:29.790> next<00:03:30.060> two<00:03:30.209> beads

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
intersection between the next two beads

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.509 
intersection between the next two beads
over<00:03:30.959> and<00:03:32.419> pulling<00:03:33.419> that<00:03:33.540> on<00:03:33.599> through<00:03:34.079> and

00:03:34.509 --> 00:03:34.519 
over and pulling that on through and

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:37.789 
over and pulling that on through and
then<00:03:35.519> just<00:03:35.699> pop<00:03:35.909> in<00:03:36.150> my<00:03:36.290> needle<00:03:37.290> back<00:03:37.470> up

00:03:37.789 --> 00:03:37.799 
then just pop in my needle back up

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:39.759 
then just pop in my needle back up
through<00:03:38.040> the<00:03:38.069> bead<00:03:38.159> that<00:03:38.519> I<00:03:38.549> just<00:03:38.790> added

00:03:39.759 --> 00:03:39.769 
through the bead that I just added

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:42.229 
through the bead that I just added
here's<00:03:40.769> one<00:03:40.980> of<00:03:41.099> the<00:03:41.190> things<00:03:41.250> to<00:03:41.609> watch<00:03:41.790> for<00:03:41.819> as

when I go to pop my needle back up
through<00:04:01.319> the<00:04:01.440> bead<00:04:01.680> that<00:04:01.739> I<00:04:01.979> just<00:04:02.129> added

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:02.579 
through the bead that I just added

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:05.149 
through the bead that I just added
I<00:04:02.729> will<00:04:02.849> accidentally<00:04:03.659> catch<00:04:04.440> my<00:04:04.709> needle<00:04:05.010> back

00:04:05.149 --> 00:04:05.159 
I will accidentally catch my needle back

I will accidentally catch my needle back
underneath<00:04:05.669> that<00:04:05.940> thread<00:04:06.329> and<00:04:06.359> what<00:04:06.930> happens

00:04:07.339 --> 00:04:07.349 
underneath that thread and what happens

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:09.559 
underneath that thread and what happens
is<00:04:07.530> the<00:04:07.799> beetle<00:04:08.069> just<00:04:08.250> fall<00:04:08.430> off<00:04:08.639> and<00:04:08.940> that's

00:04:09.559 --> 00:04:09.569 
is the beetle just fall off and that's

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:11.839 
is the beetle just fall off and that's
normal<00:04:10.049> everybody<00:04:10.530> does<00:04:10.769> it<00:04:10.979> so<00:04:11.250> just<00:04:11.579> know

00:04:11.839 --> 00:04:11.849 
normal everybody does it so just know

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:13.819 
normal everybody does it so just know
that<00:04:11.879> that's<00:04:12.810> normal<00:04:13.290> for<00:04:13.319> that<00:04:13.530> to<00:04:13.650> happen

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:13.829 
that that's normal for that to happen

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:16.129 
that that's normal for that to happen
periodically<00:04:14.340> so<00:04:14.760> if<00:04:14.849> the<00:04:14.940> bead<00:04:15.090> falls<00:04:15.690> off<00:04:15.930> it

00:04:16.129 --> 00:04:16.139 
periodically so if the bead falls off it

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:18.789 
periodically so if the bead falls off it
just<00:04:16.289> means<00:04:16.470> that<00:04:16.590> you<00:04:16.709> accidentally

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:18.799 
just means that you accidentally

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:21.979 
just means that you accidentally
unhooked<00:04:19.799> the<00:04:20.099> thread<00:04:21.000> connecting<00:04:21.269> these<00:04:21.599> the

unhooked the thread connecting these the

you'll<00:04:24.480> just<00:04:24.600> have<00:04:24.690> to<00:04:24.870> redo<00:04:25.110> it<00:04:25.140> it's<00:04:25.410> no<00:04:25.560> big

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:25.740 
you'll just have to redo it it's no big

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:27.890 
you'll just have to redo it it's no big
deal<00:04:25.980> what<00:04:26.760> what<00:04:27.090> I<00:04:27.120> like<00:04:27.330> to<00:04:27.450> do<00:04:27.540> to<00:04:27.690> try<00:04:27.810> to

deal what what I like to do to try to
keep<00:04:28.140> that<00:04:28.320> from<00:04:28.380> happening<00:04:28.530> is<00:04:29.070> I<00:04:29.100> hold<00:04:29.430> a

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:29.610 
keep that from happening is I hold a

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:33.410 
keep that from happening is I hold a
little<00:04:29.820> tension<00:04:30.090> on<00:04:30.540> the<00:04:31.130> thread<00:04:32.130> that<00:04:32.610> is<00:04:32.940> my

little tension on the thread that is my

little tension on the thread that is my
working<00:04:33.630> thread<00:04:33.990> here<00:04:34.320> and<00:04:35.570> then<00:04:36.570> I<00:04:36.600> can<00:04:36.870> kind

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:37.230 
working thread here and then I can kind

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:40.670 
working thread here and then I can kind
of<00:04:37.910> make<00:04:38.910> this<00:04:39.090> a<00:04:39.150> nice<00:04:39.420> tight<00:04:39.780> intersection

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:40.680 
of make this a nice tight intersection

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:42.260 
of make this a nice tight intersection
here<00:04:40.920> as<00:04:41.100> I'm<00:04:41.250> trying<00:04:41.430> to<00:04:41.580> go<00:04:41.670> back<00:04:41.880> up<00:04:42.090> through

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:42.270 
here as I'm trying to go back up through

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:47.720 
here as I'm trying to go back up through
the<00:04:42.330> bead<00:04:45.680> all<00:04:46.680> right<00:04:46.950> we've<00:04:47.220> got<00:04:47.250> one<00:04:47.580> more

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:47.730 
the bead all right we've got one more

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:49.400 
the bead all right we've got one more
intersection<00:04:48.360> here<00:04:48.600> so<00:04:48.720> we'll<00:04:48.840> add<00:04:48.990> one<00:04:49.230> more

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:49.410 
intersection here so we'll add one more

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:55.150 
intersection here so we'll add one more
bead<00:04:49.650> right<00:04:50.160> here<00:04:52.790> underneath<00:04:53.790> the<00:04:54.450> thread

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:55.160 
bead right here underneath the thread

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:58.790 
bead right here underneath the thread
this<00:04:56.160> is<00:04:56.370> a<00:04:56.400> little<00:04:56.880> bit<00:04:57.030> fiddly<00:04:57.300> to<00:04:57.510> do<00:04:57.930> when

00:04:58.790 --> 00:04:58.800 
this is a little bit fiddly to do when

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:01.370 
this is a little bit fiddly to do when
you<00:04:59.040> are<00:04:59.070> very<00:04:59.490> first<00:04:59.970> so<00:05:00.450> let<00:05:00.570> me<00:05:00.690> see<00:05:00.870> if<00:05:00.900> this

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:01.380 
you are very first so let me see if this

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:03.590 
you are very first so let me see if this
is<00:05:01.410> a<00:05:01.560> good<00:05:02.280> shot<00:05:02.550> for<00:05:02.730> you<00:05:02.820> to<00:05:02.940> see<00:05:03.090> to<00:05:03.300> where

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:03.600 
is a good shot for you to see to where

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:04.940 
is a good shot for you to see to where
the<00:05:03.750> needle<00:05:04.050> is<00:05:04.110> going<00:05:04.140> underneath<00:05:04.830> the

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:04.950 
the needle is going underneath the

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:06.950 
the needle is going underneath the
thread<00:05:05.340> not<00:05:05.550> going<00:05:05.940> through<00:05:06.180> any<00:05:06.360> beads<00:05:06.660> right

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:06.960 
thread not going through any beads right

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:11.000 
thread not going through any beads right
there<00:05:07.200> and<00:05:08.360> then<00:05:09.360> back<00:05:09.570> up<00:05:09.840> through<00:05:10.080> the<00:05:10.530> bead

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:11.010 
there and then back up through the bead

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:12.680 
there and then back up through the bead
you<00:05:11.250> just<00:05:11.430> added<00:05:11.820> so<00:05:12.180> it's<00:05:12.270> a<00:05:12.300> little<00:05:12.510> fiddly

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:12.690 
you just added so it's a little fiddly

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:15.440 
you just added so it's a little fiddly
for<00:05:13.170> the<00:05:13.230> first<00:05:13.440> row<00:05:13.770> or<00:05:13.950> two<00:05:13.980> when<00:05:14.580> you<00:05:14.850> don't

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:15.450 
for the first row or two when you don't

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:18.530 
for the first row or two when you don't
have<00:05:15.570> a<00:05:15.660> whole<00:05:15.840> lot<00:05:15.870> to<00:05:16.170> hold<00:05:16.230> on<00:05:16.470> to<00:05:17.120> okay<00:05:18.120> so

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:18.540 
have a whole lot to hold on to okay so

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:19.130 
have a whole lot to hold on to okay so
here<00:05:18.840> we<00:05:18.960> are

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:19.140 
here we are

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:21.710 
here we are
notice<00:05:19.710> how<00:05:19.830> it's<00:05:19.980> offset<00:05:20.520> if<00:05:20.850> this<00:05:21.570> were

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:21.720 
notice how it's offset if this were

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:23.660 
notice how it's offset if this were
sitting<00:05:22.050> this<00:05:22.200> way<00:05:22.440> that<00:05:23.160> would<00:05:23.340> be<00:05:23.490> that

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:23.670 
sitting this way that would be that

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:25.520 
sitting this way that would be that
little<00:05:23.880> peyote<00:05:24.300> you<00:05:25.020> know<00:05:25.140> that<00:05:25.290> would<00:05:25.440> be

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:25.530 
little peyote you know that would be

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:27.020 
little peyote you know that would be
your<00:05:25.650> up<00:05:25.770> bead<00:05:25.980> and<00:05:26.160> you're<00:05:26.250> down<00:05:26.400> bead<00:05:26.730> for

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:27.030 
your up bead and you're down bead for

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:29.000 
your up bead and you're down bead for
the<00:05:27.060> peyote<00:05:27.420> we<00:05:28.110> just<00:05:28.290> happen<00:05:28.530> to<00:05:28.620> be<00:05:28.710> building

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:29.010 
the peyote we just happen to be building

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:31.910 
the peyote we just happen to be building
it<00:05:29.160> this<00:05:29.310> way<00:05:29.600> so<00:05:30.600> now<00:05:30.810> that<00:05:30.870> we've<00:05:31.440> added<00:05:31.470> the

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:31.920 
it this way so now that we've added the

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:33.890 
it this way so now that we've added the
last<00:05:32.190> bead<00:05:32.820> to<00:05:33.150> the<00:05:33.240> last<00:05:33.480> thread

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:33.900 
last bead to the last thread

last bead to the last thread
intersection<00:05:34.470> here<00:05:34.710> we<00:05:34.980> have<00:05:35.130> to<00:05:35.340> add<00:05:35.840> start<00:05:36.840> a

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:36.930 
intersection here we have to add start a

intersection here we have to add start a
new<00:05:37.110> row<00:05:37.320> I<00:05:37.670> because<00:05:38.670> I'm<00:05:38.790> a<00:05:38.850> creature<00:05:39.060> of

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:39.180 
new row I because I'm a creature of

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:41.240 
new row I because I'm a creature of
habit<00:05:39.360> I<00:05:39.750> like<00:05:40.020> to<00:05:40.140> always<00:05:40.290> work<00:05:40.680> from<00:05:41.070> right

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:41.250 
habit I like to always work from right

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:43.280 
habit I like to always work from right
to<00:05:41.280> left<00:05:41.430> because<00:05:42.150> I'm<00:05:42.270> a<00:05:42.330> righty<00:05:42.570> so<00:05:42.900> I<00:05:42.930> go

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:43.290 
to left because I'm a righty so I go

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:45.350 
to left because I'm a righty so I go
ahead<00:05:43.350> and<00:05:43.560> flip<00:05:43.770> my<00:05:43.830> work<00:05:44.490> so<00:05:44.700> that<00:05:44.790> I<00:05:44.820> can<00:05:45.060> now

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:45.360

work in the same direction again I'm
going<00:05:47.970> to<00:05:48.030> start<00:05:48.210> a<00:05:48.360> new<00:05:48.390> row<00:05:48.690> which<00:05:49.050> means

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:49.380 
going to start a new row which means

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:52.310 
going to start a new row which means
that<00:05:49.650> I'm<00:05:49.740> picking<00:05:49.950> up<00:05:50.190> two<00:05:50.430> beads<00:05:51.320> first

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:52.320 
that I'm picking up two beads first

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:54.230 
that I'm picking up two beads first
stitch<00:05:52.560> of<00:05:52.860> every<00:05:53.130> new<00:05:53.490> row<00:05:53.730> is<00:05:54.000> going<00:05:54.060> to<00:05:54.180> be

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:54.240 
stitch of every new row is going to be

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:56.450 
stitch of every new row is going to be
two<00:05:54.510> beads<00:05:54.780> you're<00:05:55.560> still<00:05:55.890> going<00:05:56.130> to<00:05:56.160> catch

00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:56.460 
two beads you're still going to catch

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:58.640 
two beads you're still going to catch
that<00:05:56.490> very<00:05:57.000> first<00:05:57.360> intersection<00:05:58.110> when<00:05:58.410> you<00:05:58.530> do

00:05:58.640 --> 00:05:58.650 
that very first intersection when you do

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:02.360 
that very first intersection when you do
that<00:06:00.200> might<00:06:01.200> have<00:06:01.350> to<00:06:01.500> encourage<00:06:01.830> the<00:06:02.160> beads

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:02.370 
that might have to encourage the beads

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:04.540 
that might have to encourage the beads
to<00:06:02.640> kind<00:06:02.820> of<00:06:02.910> sit<00:06:03.180> the<00:06:03.690> way<00:06:03.810> you<00:06:03.870> want<00:06:04.140> them<00:06:04.200> to

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:04.550 
to kind of sit the way you want them to

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:06.860 
to kind of sit the way you want them to
I'm<00:06:05.550> going<00:06:05.700> to<00:06:05.760> pass<00:06:05.970> back<00:06:06.270> up<00:06:06.540> through<00:06:06.780> the

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:06.870 
I'm going to pass back up through the

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:13.220 
I'm going to pass back up through the
bead<00:06:07.050> that's<00:06:07.410> directly<00:06:08.070> overhead<00:06:10.790> and<00:06:12.230> then

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:13.230 
bead that's directly overhead and then

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:15.080 
bead that's directly overhead and then
because<00:06:13.650> this<00:06:13.830> is<00:06:14.040> the<00:06:14.190> first<00:06:14.460> stitch<00:06:14.760> of<00:06:14.820> this

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:15.090 
because this is the first stitch of this

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:18.140 
because this is the first stitch of this
new<00:06:15.360> row<00:06:15.630> and<00:06:15.990> I<00:06:16.710> added<00:06:17.070> two<00:06:17.310> what<00:06:17.820> I<00:06:17.850> want<00:06:18.060> to

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:18.150 
new row and I added two what I want to

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:19.670 
new row and I added two what I want to
do<00:06:18.270> is<00:06:18.480> back<00:06:18.720> up<00:06:18.960> and<00:06:19.050> just<00:06:19.260> circle<00:06:19.620> around

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:19.680 
do is back up and just circle around

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:25.190 
do is back up and just circle around
those<00:06:20.160> two<00:06:20.430> that<00:06:20.610> I<00:06:20.700> added<00:06:21.090> all<00:06:23.750> right<00:06:24.750> and<00:06:25.020> now

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:25.200 
those two that I added all right and now

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:27.560 
those two that I added all right and now
you<00:06:25.260> can<00:06:25.500> see<00:06:25.740> where<00:06:26.100> that<00:06:26.460> is<00:06:26.520> now<00:06:26.820> created

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:27.570 
you can see where that is now created

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:31.130 
you can see where that is now created
the<00:06:28.530> next<00:06:28.920> piece<00:06:29.220> of<00:06:29.460> this<00:06:29.820> almost<00:06:30.660> peyote

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:31.140 
the next piece of this almost peyote

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:34.040 
the next piece of this almost peyote
looking<00:06:31.620> up<00:06:32.400> bead<00:06:32.760> and<00:06:32.970> down<00:06:33.180> bead<00:06:33.479> kind<00:06:33.960> of

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:34.050 
looking up bead and down bead kind of

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:37.370 
looking up bead and down bead kind of
thing<00:06:34.290> and<00:06:34.530> you'll<00:06:35.430> just<00:06:35.610> keep<00:06:36.060> adding

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:37.380 
thing and you'll just keep adding

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:42.470 
thing and you'll just keep adding
so<00:06:38.100> pick<00:06:38.340> up<00:06:38.370> one<00:06:39.740> catch<00:06:41.090> right<00:06:42.090> enter<00:06:42.270> in<00:06:42.390> the

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:42.480 
so pick up one catch right enter in the

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:45.680 
so pick up one catch right enter in the
next<00:06:42.630> intersection<00:06:43.500> and<00:06:44.120> then<00:06:45.120> back<00:06:45.420> up

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:45.690 
next intersection and then back up

00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:48.760 
next intersection and then back up
through<00:06:45.720> the<00:06:45.960> bead<00:06:46.050> that<00:06:46.410> you<00:06:46.500> just<00:06:46.680> added<00:06:47.100> and

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:48.770 
through the bead that you just added and

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:53.360 
through the bead that you just added and
that<00:06:49.770> is<00:06:51.590> how<00:06:52.590> you<00:06:52.650> do<00:06:52.920> brick<00:06:53.100> stitch

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:53.370 
that is how you do brick stitch

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:54.530 
that is how you do brick stitch
super-easy

00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:54.540 
super-easy

00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:56.300 
super-easy
once<00:06:55.110> you<00:06:55.290> get<00:06:55.410> comfortable<00:06:55.470> with<00:06:56.160> the

00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:56.310 
once you get comfortable with the

00:06:56.310 --> 00:06:58.010 
once you get comfortable with the
concept<00:06:56.520> of<00:06:56.910> looping<00:06:57.330> under<00:06:57.600> the<00:06:57.720> thread

00:06:58.010 --> 00:06:58.020 
concept of looping under the thread

00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:00.250 
concept of looping under the thread
you'll<00:06:58.260> realize<00:06:58.590> it's<00:06:58.830> just<00:06:58.920> as<00:06:59.370> strong<00:06:59.490> as

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:00.260 
you'll realize it's just as strong as

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:02.840 
you'll realize it's just as strong as
anything<00:07:01.260> that<00:07:01.590> you<00:07:02.070> work<00:07:02.340> with<00:07:02.490> where<00:07:02.730> you're

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:02.850 
anything that you work with where you're

00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:04.940 
anything that you work with where you're
actually<00:07:02.970> passing<00:07:03.510> through<00:07:03.690> the<00:07:03.810> bead<00:07:04.020> the

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:04.950 
actually passing through the bead the

00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:06.530 
actually passing through the bead the
thread<00:07:05.220> is<00:07:05.400> obviously<00:07:05.970> what<00:07:06.210> holds

00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:06.540 
thread is obviously what holds

00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:08.480 
thread is obviously what holds
everything<00:07:06.600> together<00:07:06.960> anyway<00:07:07.500> so<00:07:07.920> it<00:07:08.280> really

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:08.490 
everything together anyway so it really

00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:09.590 
everything together anyway so it really
doesn't<00:07:08.700> make<00:07:08.880> a<00:07:08.910> difference<00:07:09.060> whether<00:07:09.390> you're

00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:09.600 
doesn't make a difference whether you're

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:11.510 
doesn't make a difference whether you're
catching<00:07:10.230> a<00:07:10.320> thread<00:07:10.590> or<00:07:10.800> catching<00:07:11.160> a<00:07:11.250> bead

brick<00:07:12.510> stitch<00:07:12.720> can<00:07:12.990> be<00:07:13.110> a<00:07:13.140> little<00:07:13.260> more<00:07:13.470> subtle

brick stitch can be a little more subtle
than<00:07:14.130> peyote<00:07:14.640> stitch<00:07:14.820> especially<00:07:15.690> in<00:07:15.780> the

look of peyote a peyote stitch tube will
be<00:07:24.420> pretty<00:07:24.780> solid<00:07:25.440> and<00:07:25.680> straight<00:07:26.100> where<00:07:26.880> a
