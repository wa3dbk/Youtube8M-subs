00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:46.140
 I start amanda the eyelid and then slowly fade towards the other 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.110

 i'm called mineral I would have set up this very particular color because 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:54.919
 it looks almost like a lavender once you put it command medium gray and 

00:03:54.919 --> 00:03:57.799
 I was a package inside it 

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:03.340
 small specks of virgin kate so it is a color that is good for the day for 

00:04:03.339 --> 00:04:06.689
 how to say a new stucco 

00:04:06.689 --> 00:04:09.689
 which is not a smoky because it is not too air 

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:16.730
 too intense or exaggerated for the day but gives a pleasant effect 

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:21.859
 of intensity and if the word in time to all gives the eye color 

00:04:23.189 --> 00:04:26.189
 so let's see how the heart looks. 

00:04:27.509 --> 00:04:29.139

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:05.220
