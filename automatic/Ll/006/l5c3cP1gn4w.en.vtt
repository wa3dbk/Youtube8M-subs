 hi to all and axel of cups mobile.fr 

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:09.950
 I am talented it is 2015 on the stand of 

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:14.090
 casam and I have in hand the casam 

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:16.609
 thunder 450w she then w like windows 

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:18.470
 phone it as bigger than 

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:20.509
 the w short when we will take in 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:21.679
 hand also so it's a terminal 

00:00:20.509 --> 00:00:23.210
 even bigger size anyway 

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:25.279
 highest resolution offers the most 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:27.319
 large larger peace that will tell 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:30.289
 so it's a terminal with a screen of 

00:00:27.319 --> 00:00:32.649
 5 inches 701 pl cdi ps 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:36.010
 it runs under windows phone 8 points 1 

00:00:32.649 --> 00:00:38.420
 it's 1.2 gigahertz quad core 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:40.760
 8 megapixel camera at the back 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:42.739
 2 megapixel front 8 gigabytes of memory 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:46.460
 internal a gig of ram 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:49.910
 he has in single sim version and in two 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:51.530
 color so one is rather money and 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:53.480
 you have the color that's called 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:56.059
 champagne in celebration is finally golden 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:58.179
 and so we'll take a look at this 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:00:59.809
 then produces me what 

00:00:58.179 --> 00:01:01.969
 immediately when I look at him from 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:04.370
 face as wise and it makes me think of 

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:06.050
 1.8 makes it a htc or a single theme 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:09.590
 sivu maybe no worse besides 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:12.110
 on the other hand plastic is where 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:13.400
 you have the front camera 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:15.770
 I try to show you the camera 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:19.720
 frontal some sensors the output 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:22.760
 audio down there we have an empty area 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:24.710
 you see with the keys finally there we 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.210
 has an empty area as at htc a 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:28.240
 some way but we decided 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:30.650
 sensitive touch here 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:34.220
 this is someone who is typing in my foot 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:36.020
 thank you sir to laon to all saints to 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:43.490
 lock unlock the button 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:45.500
 micro usb volume the jack nothing left 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:47.630
 the hull must be removable to coke is 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.200
 apparently removable to insert well 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:50.030
 on a 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.740
 so can we put a microphone 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:53.090
 sd worm can be a microsd so 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:54.800
 of course also the asim 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:58.970
 then the back that looks like that then 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:02:02.300
 with a brushed aluminum treatment but it's 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:06.170
 plastic then toc 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:08.000
 it turns under 8.1 but we imagine who 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:10.640
 can go under windows says I know 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.840
 but we see no there there were given by 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.060
 example I do not want to make a decision 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.950
 complete hand of windows phone 8 points 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:17.330
 we start to really know by 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:21.390
 heart the thing 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:23.850
 but that seems to turn out well on 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.140
 this terminal with a beautiful screen also 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:28.980
 I have the impression that here are the angles 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:31.290
 of view are rather good it is rather a 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.300
 pretty attractive device I will you 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.400
 show I do not know of three doors 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:38.970
 annaba not be able to make it work 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:40.230
 we're going to look at it maybe 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.610
 look at the camera it can be 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:44.540
 useful there is no button there is no 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:48.420
 dedicated button for the camera 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:50.220
 good see it's from below dense to 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.290
 six and in the case but one his bones and in 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.850
 bone 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:57.540
 here we go this is the device 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:59.190
 basic picture let's say in in 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.660
 windows phone in the last 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:04.050
 versions here it is with different 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:06.360
 filters up there the flash management the 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:07.890
 front camera and it's a lure of 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:09.600
 to work rather well I do not have the 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:11.670
 price in the head I do not know if it was 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:13.980
 unveiled in any case if it was good the 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:15.600
 will put in one of our articles on ts 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.590
 mobile.fr so I invite you to watch 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.880
 it interests you 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:20.280
 so that was it for my little girl 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:21.720
 handling of thunder 450w she from 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:26.180
