how<00:01:19.590> can<00:01:19.920> that<00:01:19.950> possibly<00:01:20.159> work<00:01:21.000> because

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
how can that possibly work because

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.600 
how can that possibly work because

the<00:01:23.820> Filipino<00:01:24.299> government<00:01:24.720> how<00:01:25.080> can<00:01:25.350> it<00:01:25.439> give

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
the Filipino government how can it give

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.070 
the Filipino government how can it give
away<00:01:25.950> security<00:01:26.670> of<00:01:26.880> a<00:01:27.299> part<00:01:27.570> of<00:01:27.720> its<00:01:27.930> own

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
away security of a part of its own

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:33.289 
away security of a part of its own

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
country it's not giving away security I

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:34.760 
country it's not giving away security I
think<00:01:33.600> it's<00:01:33.750> actually<00:01:33.960> entering<00:01:34.470> into<00:01:34.650> a

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
think it's actually entering into a

and women together so i think that the
important<00:02:44.640> element<00:02:45.090> of<00:02:45.180> what<00:02:45.330> the<00:02:45.450> police

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
important element of what the police

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:47.420 
important element of what the police
will<00:02:46.080> look<00:02:46.230> like<00:02:46.440> certainly<00:02:47.070> there<00:02:47.220> will<00:02:47.280> be

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
will look like certainly there will be

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.000 
will look like certainly there will be
former<00:02:47.790> malf<00:02:48.300> fighters<00:02:48.750> we<00:02:49.260> hope<00:02:49.440> also<00:02:49.620> other

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
former malf fighters we hope also other

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.460 
former malf fighters we hope also other
former<00:02:50.550> armed<00:02:50.790> groups<00:02:51.060> will<00:02:51.390> be<00:02:51.510> joy<00:02:51.870> in<00:02:52.410> that

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
former armed groups will be joy in that

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.980 
former armed groups will be joy in that
but<00:02:53.130> through<00:02:53.370> training<00:02:53.760> into<00:02:54.120> a<00:02:54.150> transition

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:54.990 
but through training into a transition

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:57.350

process<00:02:55.230> that's<00:02:55.710> carefully<00:02:56.250> done<00:02:57.210> together

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
process that's carefully done together

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.180 
process that's carefully done together
in<00:02:57.750> conjunction<00:02:58.200> with<00:02:58.350> the<00:02:58.620> Republic<00:02:59.040> of<00:02:59.130> the

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
out to people all over but I think us

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.740 
out to people all over but I think us
today<00:03:31.800> and<00:03:32.100> was<00:03:32.760> described<00:03:33.210> I<00:03:33.330> think<00:03:33.540> in<00:03:33.660> the

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
today and was described I think in the

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:36.800 
today and was described I think in the
Philippine<00:03:34.170> Inquirer<00:03:34.560> is<00:03:34.800> a<00:03:35.540> massive<00:03:36.540> burst

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
Philippine Inquirer is a massive burst

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:38.720 
Philippine Inquirer is a massive burst
on<00:03:37.080> social<00:03:37.500> media<00:03:37.530> of<00:03:37.950> people<00:03:38.310> from<00:03:38.520> all<00:03:38.700> walks

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 
on social media of people from all walks

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:41.540 
on social media of people from all walks
of<00:03:39.210> life<00:03:39.440> welcoming<00:03:40.440> disagreement<00:03:41.340> most

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:41.550 
of life welcoming disagreement most

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:43.580 
of life welcoming disagreement most
certainly<00:03:41.940> there<00:03:42.240> will<00:03:42.300> be<00:03:42.420> people<00:03:42.720> who<00:03:42.750> who

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
certainly there will be people who who

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.170 
certainly there will be people who who
feel<00:03:43.860> that<00:03:43.890> it<00:03:44.220> doesn't<00:03:44.550> represent<00:03:44.640> their

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
feel that it doesn't represent their

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.000 
feel that it doesn't represent their
interests<00:03:45.540> but<00:03:45.780> I<00:03:45.960> think<00:03:46.170> over<00:03:46.440> time<00:03:46.470> and

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010 
interests but I think over time and

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:49.730 
interests but I think over time and
through<00:03:47.730> the<00:03:47.850> wide-ranging<00:03:48.740> consultations

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:49.740 
through the wide-ranging consultations

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:52.940 
through the wide-ranging consultations
that<00:03:49.830> are<00:03:50.070> happening<00:03:50.160> around<00:03:51.470> with<00:03:52.470> support

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:52.950 
that are happening around with support
