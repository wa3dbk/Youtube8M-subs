00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
 all products processed them 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.940
 industrialized products must wear 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.379
 on their packaging different mentions 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.780
 which will therefore inform the consumer 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:12.950
 knowing that these mentions are under the 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.950
 manufacturer's liability 

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:17.340
 so there are mandatory mentions 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:18.570
 so especially what's called the 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.770
 sales denomination 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.869
 so that's what we're going to find 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.000
 in the box what exactly is the 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.420
 product says the chicken drop so there 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.950
 other mandatory information is specified 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:30.810
 so that's the list of ingredients the 

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:33.650
 ingredients are indicated in order of 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:37.050
 weight goes from the heaviest to the lightest 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:39.180
 and then also happens the figures the 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.420
 additives so there acidity correctors 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:45.239
 and his threats finally appear dist there 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.489
 also indicates if this is the case 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:50.129
 allergens or at least the risk of 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:52.019
 find allergenic substances in 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.519
 this product so there we had and upholstery 

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:55.739
 has become mandatory since a few 

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:59.609
 years still in mentions 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:01.649
 mandatory so there is the date the date 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:04.620
 of expiry ie the silk the 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:07.680
 expiry date dlc for the 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:10.050
 perishable products like here where the 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.850
 deadline for optimal use as 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:14.070
 for example for him when they are 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:17.220
 commodities that can last over time 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.750
 there we see side to the lot number him 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.730
 also is obligatory so we mark it 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.520
 part in this series of numbers and 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:25.800
 often it's that she or the water so that 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.320
 that will allow in case of claim in 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:30.840
 case of failure of a product to go up 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:34.200
 the chain is knowing exactly where 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.940
 when exactly it was manufactured this 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.640
 which is obligatory also so it's 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:41.730
 the name or business name and address 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:44.490
 manufacturer or conditioner or 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:46.770
 still from the seller so here sees it with 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.140
 everything else there is usually also a 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.510
 phone number that is accessible 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.050
 to consumers in case of questions of 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:54.050
 claim 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:58.540
 the labels are like very talkative on 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:01.090
 can find a lot of information 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:04.030
 of which other pensions or optional 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:06.340
 depending on the type of food then there 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:08.500
 for example it is a product that 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.700
 contains products of animal origin 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.610
 because it's meat 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:14.410
 so there is what is called 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:16.300
 veterinary stamping is found 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:17.500
 so this is this oval shape so it is 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:19.030
 on many of its products that in 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:22.480
 contain meat or fish 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:24.250
 or even dairy products is there 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:27.040
 so that means that services 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:31.230
 veterinarians inspected the premises so 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:33.670
 in this case the slaughterhouse and so have 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:35.050
 check that they meet the standards 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:38.350
 of health and hygiene 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:40.570
 so the ffr for France there we find 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:42.459
 in fact the code of the commune not the 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:45.580
 department and the commune plus the code 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:47.730
 of the establishment and therefore in 6th so in 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:51.040
 European Community 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:52.690
 so now we also find his 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:55.269
 happens according to the so-called code 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:57.010
 in value so we find it by the mbc 

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:59.590
 the blow tooth was conditioned on 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:02.140
 produces these valuable as information 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:03.070
 because it's this code is the INSEE code 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:05.110
 from the community 

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:07.060
 so you can we can easily 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:08.440
 find and so it corresponds to a 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:11.170
 accurate common so that allows for 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:13.329
 find the place of the machined where it has 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:15.370
 been conditioned otherwise there are mentions 

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:17.049
 which are not mandatory as 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:19.299
 nutritional labeling 

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:21.340
 good so we find on almost all 

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:24.400
 packaged products 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:27.220
 so at least there is therefore the 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.510
 caloric value the lipids the 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:30.310
 proteins and carbohydrates 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:32.370
 we can find more for sodium 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:37.150
 we can also find the fatty acids 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:39.670
 saturated and we can finally find 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:43.000
 other mentions then the cdd mention 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:43.510
 more of use is also the 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
 origin 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:47.769
 you have to know that the provenance or 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.850
 manufactured or not required 

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:52.690
 unless it can be confusing 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:54.010
 the example is amp the Swedish breads 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:56.410
 which are made in France 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:57.870
 so there it must be indicated manufactured 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:01.329
 in France for not only the consumer 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:02.650
 can be deceived about the origin of the 

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:04.239
 product 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:06.930
 or core iso of spain which is also 

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:06.930
 developed in France
