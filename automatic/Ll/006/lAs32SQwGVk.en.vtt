this<00:00:14.130> works<00:00:14.549> is<00:00:14.969> I'm<00:00:15.210> going<00:00:15.389> to<00:00:15.450> strap<00:00:15.809> a

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
this works is I'm going to strap a

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.349 
this works is I'm going to strap a
couple<00:00:16.350> of<00:00:16.440> electrodes<00:00:16.980> to<00:00:17.220> nawlins<00:00:17.789> arm<00:00:18.029> we

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
couple of electrodes to nawlins arm we

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.050 
couple of electrodes to nawlins arm we
are<00:00:18.510> going<00:00:18.660> to<00:00:18.810> listen<00:00:19.350> to<00:00:19.619> the<00:00:20.220> brain<00:00:20.490> signals

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
are going to listen to the brain signals

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.750 
are going to listen to the brain signals
sent<00:00:21.600> from<00:00:21.900> Nolan's<00:00:22.500> motor<00:00:22.710> cortex<00:00:23.130> down<00:00:23.580> to

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
sent from Nolan's motor cortex down to

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.160 
sent from Nolan's motor cortex down to
his<00:00:23.880> arm<00:00:24.060> when<00:00:24.180> he<00:00:24.210> flexes<00:00:24.689> we're<00:00:24.990> going<00:00:25.109> to

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
his arm when he flexes we're going to

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.070 
his arm when he flexes we're going to
copy<00:00:25.529> those<00:00:25.859> signals<00:00:26.460> and<00:00:26.670> inject<00:00:27.660> them<00:00:27.779> into

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
copy those signals and inject them into

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.880 
copy those signals and inject them into
my<00:00:28.680> arm<00:00:28.980> so<00:00:29.699> when<00:00:29.970> he<00:00:30.269> moves<00:00:30.539> his<00:00:30.810> arm<00:00:31.109> it's

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
my arm so when he moves his arm it's

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.920 
my arm so when he moves his arm it's
actually<00:00:32.250> going<00:00:32.369> to<00:00:32.460> move<00:00:32.579> mine<00:00:32.820> he's<00:00:33.540> going

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
actually going to move mine he's going

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.840 
actually going to move mine he's going
to<00:00:34.200> control<00:00:34.680> me<00:00:35.070> as<00:00:35.370> I<00:00:36.210> control<00:00:37.110> palm<00:00:37.850> do

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
to control me as I control palm do

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.720 
to control me as I control palm do
something<00:00:39.360> sketchy<00:00:39.809> about<00:00:40.129> it<00:00:41.210> so<00:00:42.210> flex<00:00:43.140> up

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:43.730 
something sketchy about it so flex up

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:50.209 
something sketchy about it so flex up
flex<00:00:44.730> and<00:00:44.940> we<00:00:45.210> need<00:00:45.420> you<00:00:45.539> to<00:00:45.750> go<00:00:46.140> right<00:00:49.219> that

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
flex and we need you to go right that

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
down so you you flex your arm whenever

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.709 
down so you you flex your arm whenever
you<00:00:55.890> like<00:00:56.039> bring<00:00:56.460> it<00:00:56.579> close<00:00:56.850> right<00:00:57.210> up<00:00:57.239> teacher

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
you like bring it close right up teacher

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:20.899 
you like bring it close right up teacher
ah<00:00:58.789> I'm<00:00:59.789> liking<00:01:00.300> this<00:01:14.420> working<00:01:15.680> 13-14
