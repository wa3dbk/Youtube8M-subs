 hello youtube people today I bring you from 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.720
 new the video of how to activate windows 8 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.790
 professional but as everyone knows 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.019
 microsoft has blocked the serials for 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.030
 activate it 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.940
 then we will activate it with another 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:18.300
 thing with a good activator let's start 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:21.630
 I'm going to show you the good activator here 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:26.970
 we have the activator serves 100% it 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:29.010
 guarantees them and here the serials but 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.960
 as microsoft blocked the serial no 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:34.680
 we will be able to activate it legally 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:37.160
 then I'm going to erase it now I'm going to 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.690
 extract to use it and thus teach them 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:42.980
 having left the activator I'm just going 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.980
 to open to show them 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:53.000
 good this mirror 8 version 25 raised it 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:56.720
 to 4 servimedia files just follow the 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.640
 instructions to be able to activate now 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:01.239
 I'm going to extract it to use it and so 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.239
 teach them 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:25.899
 well almost the activator is this 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:27.700
 for any edition of windows 8 and 

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:29.509
 this but active forever good 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:34.039

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:34.039
 think about it, we execute like the counter 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:46.010
 they will leave a box like that but I will 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:48.110
 I give cancel because min windows is 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:50.300
 activated with a serial two days before 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:52.220
 that will block it but you leave it 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:55.010

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:56.870
