00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.840
 Hi, this is Real. 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:20.740
 This is the time to introduce the site with the OBJ files you wanted! 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:22.820
 So let's get started! 

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:26.960
 This is the first site to introduce. 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:33.940
 If you enter tf3dm.com in the address bar ...! 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.560
 This site will pop up. 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.820
 The categories of tf3dm are those icon shapes. The right-hand knife-shape is a weapon category. 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.880
 These guns come out of the left. There is a transformer. 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:00.020
 tf3dm is mainly a site with 3D models of realistic graphics. 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.960
 I will introduce the following site. 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:15.380
 If you enter www.models-resource.com in the address bar ...! 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.120
 I have a site like this. 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:26.280
 The category of the model resource is divided by the platform of the game like this. 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:32.400
 Then I did not get the footage, but I found the title by ABC at the top. 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.880
 This tutorial is here. Let's see it in chapter 33!
