00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:29.100 
do this mock rolled hem here at the top

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:32.709 
do this mock rolled hem here at the top
but<00:00:29.790> this<00:00:30.000> is<00:00:30.180> what<00:00:30.420> we're<00:00:30.630> working<00:00:31.260> on<00:00:31.590> and<00:00:31.950> so

going<00:00:38.760> to<00:00:38.879> add<00:00:39.679> elastic<00:00:40.679> thread<00:00:41.570> to<00:00:42.570> the

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
going to add elastic thread to the

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.560 
going to add elastic thread to the
bobbin<00:00:43.199> of<00:00:43.409> my<00:00:44.010> machine<00:00:44.399> so<00:00:44.730> that<00:00:44.879> we<00:00:44.999> can<00:00:45.269> do

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
bobbin of my machine so that we can do

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.069 
bobbin of my machine so that we can do
our<00:00:45.600> shearing<00:00:46.350> now<00:00:47.100> I'm<00:00:47.429> going<00:00:47.789> to<00:00:48.079> very

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
our shearing now I'm going to very

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.770 
our shearing now I'm going to very
slowly<00:00:49.589> wind<00:00:50.280> this<00:00:50.550> onto<00:00:50.969> my<00:00:51.059> machine<00:00:51.239> which

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
slowly wind this onto my machine which

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.049 
slowly wind this onto my machine which
is<00:00:51.960> very<00:00:52.289> little<00:00:52.649> tension<00:00:52.920> with<00:00:53.370> my<00:00:53.579> fingers

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
is very little tension with my fingers

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.750 
is very little tension with my fingers
right<00:00:54.359> here<00:00:54.510> and<00:00:55.199> try<00:00:55.589> to<00:00:55.649> get<00:00:55.859> it<00:00:55.979> on<00:00:56.069> so<00:00:56.609> that

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
right here and try to get it on so that

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:02.059 
right here and try to get it on so that
it<00:00:56.850> goes<00:00:56.999> on<00:00:57.210> nice<00:00:57.769> and<00:00:58.769> even<00:01:00.350> back<00:01:01.350> and<00:01:01.739> forth

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:02.069

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:24.460 
gonna clip it pull it off of our machine

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:28.050 
gonna clip it pull it off of our machine
and<00:01:24.640> we're<00:01:24.760> ready<00:01:24.940> to<00:01:25.060> so<00:01:26.730> we're<00:01:27.730> going<00:01:27.940> to

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:33.810 
begin our shearing video and what I've
done<00:01:31.000> is<00:01:31.270> I<00:01:31.420> put<00:01:31.990> my<00:01:32.230> elastic<00:01:32.800> thread<00:01:33.310> bobbin

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:33.820 
done is I put my elastic thread bobbin

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:36.870 
done is I put my elastic thread bobbin
in<00:01:34.030> my<00:01:34.210> machine<00:01:34.360> and<00:01:34.630> I<00:01:34.990> pulled<00:01:35.350> up<00:01:35.700> the<00:01:36.700> bobbin

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:36.880 
in my machine and I pulled up the bobbin

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.120 
in my machine and I pulled up the bobbin

to squish that to the back I'm also
going<00:01:42.400> to<00:01:42.490> change<00:01:42.910> the<00:01:43.210> tension<00:01:43.480> on<00:01:43.930> my<00:01:44.320> sewing

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:44.620 
going to change the tension on my sewing

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:46.850 
going to change the tension on my sewing
machine<00:01:45.100> so<00:01:45.490> for<00:01:45.880> this<00:01:46.030> particular<00:01:46.330> machine

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
machine so for this particular machine

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.120 
machine so for this particular machine
my<00:01:47.860> presser<00:01:48.700> foot<00:01:48.910> is<00:01:48.940> up<00:01:49.710> it<00:01:50.710> says<00:01:50.920> right<00:01:51.100> here

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:51.130 
my presser foot is up it says right here

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:53.670 
my presser foot is up it says right here
that<00:01:51.610> I<00:01:51.640> have<00:01:51.730> normal<00:01:52.390> tension<00:01:52.990> I<00:01:53.170> want<00:01:53.530> to

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:53.680 
that I have normal tension I want to

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:57.830 
that I have normal tension I want to
tighten<00:01:54.190> it<00:01:54.280> up<00:01:54.400> to<00:01:55.180> a<00:01:55.480> medium<00:01:55.930> tight<00:01:56.470> tension

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
tighten it up to a medium tight tension

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.230 
tighten it up to a medium tight tension
okay<00:01:58.840> now<00:01:59.050> we're<00:01:59.260> going<00:01:59.350> to<00:01:59.410> go<00:01:59.620> back<00:02:00.240> and

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:06.190 
begin our shearing okay now we want to

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:08.220 
begin our shearing okay now we want to
leave<00:02:06.370> for<00:02:06.790> this<00:02:06.940> particular<00:02:07.240> pattern<00:02:07.780> an

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:08.230 
leave for this particular pattern an

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:29.390 
to the bottom down here it will be much

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:32.350 
to the bottom down here it will be much
smaller<00:05:29.750> than<00:05:30.200> it<00:05:30.380> is<00:05:30.590> here<00:05:30.620> at<00:05:31.100> the<00:05:31.160> top<00:05:31.430> so
