00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:15.930 
right one for you is going to basically
disappear<00:05:12.610> so<00:05:13.449> look<00:05:13.930> at<00:05:14.020> the<00:05:14.110> third<00:05:14.409> one<00:05:14.940> you

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:15.940 
disappear so look at the third one you

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:17.550 
disappear so look at the third one you
can't<00:05:16.240> you<00:05:16.539> probably<00:05:16.780> can't<00:05:17.050> even<00:05:17.110> see<00:05:17.409> that

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:17.560 
can't you probably can't even see that

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:19.469 
can't you probably can't even see that
on<00:05:17.680> Cara<00:05:18.009> because<00:05:18.370> it's<00:05:18.550> such<00:05:18.849> a<00:05:19.030> good<00:05:19.240> match

00:05:19.469 --> 00:05:19.479 
on Cara because it's such a good match

00:05:19.479 --> 00:05:22.769 
on Cara because it's such a good match
to<00:05:19.509> my<00:05:19.900> skin<00:05:20.319> that<00:05:21.159> is<00:05:21.460> exactly<00:05:21.940> what<00:05:22.360> you<00:05:22.539> want

00:05:22.769 --> 00:05:22.779 
to my skin that is exactly what you want

00:05:22.779 --> 00:05:25.350 
to my skin that is exactly what you want
and<00:05:23.250> sometimes<00:05:24.250> if<00:05:24.699> I<00:05:24.819> go<00:05:25.000> to<00:05:25.060> the<00:05:25.210> department

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:25.360 
and sometimes if I go to the department

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:27.029 
and sometimes if I go to the department
store<00:05:25.750> because<00:05:26.229> of<00:05:26.380> the<00:05:26.440> fluorescent

00:05:27.029 --> 00:05:27.039 
store because of the fluorescent

00:05:27.039 --> 00:05:29.100 
store because of the fluorescent
lighting<00:05:27.250> in<00:05:27.460> there<00:05:27.610> when<00:05:28.270> they<00:05:28.419> do<00:05:28.479> this<00:05:28.810> on

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:29.110 
lighting in there when they do this on

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:31.170 
lighting in there when they do this on
my<00:05:29.319> cheek<00:05:29.650> I<00:05:29.830> will<00:05:30.039> ask<00:05:30.279> them<00:05:30.520> for<00:05:30.669> a<00:05:30.729> handheld

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:31.180 
my cheek I will ask them for a handheld

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:32.459 
my cheek I will ask them for a handheld
mirror<00:05:31.539> and<00:05:31.750> I'll<00:05:31.810> say<00:05:31.960> do<00:05:32.050> you<00:05:32.110> mind<00:05:32.169> if<00:05:32.319> I

00:05:32.459 --> 00:05:32.469 
mirror and I'll say do you mind if I

00:05:32.469 --> 00:05:34.170 
mirror and I'll say do you mind if I
take<00:05:32.680> this<00:05:32.800> over<00:05:33.009> near<00:05:33.279> the<00:05:33.310> door<00:05:33.729> so<00:05:33.940> I<00:05:33.969> can

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:34.180 
take this over near the door so I can

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:36.420 
take this over near the door so I can
see<00:05:34.360> this<00:05:34.509> natural<00:05:35.139> light<00:05:35.380> and<00:05:36.130> of<00:05:36.400> course

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:36.430 
see this natural light and of course

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:37.950 
see this natural light and of course
they're<00:05:36.789> going<00:05:36.909> to<00:05:36.969> say<00:05:37.120> yes<00:05:37.360> you<00:05:37.539> just<00:05:37.719> walk

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:37.960 
they're going to say yes you just walk

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:40.350 
they're going to say yes you just walk
over<00:05:37.990> the<00:05:38.409> door<00:05:38.590> and<00:05:38.860> you<00:05:39.310> hold<00:05:39.580> it<00:05:39.729> up<00:05:39.880> and<00:05:40.150> you

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:40.360 
over the door and you hold it up and you

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:42.029 
over the door and you hold it up and you
figure<00:05:40.810> out<00:05:40.840> which<00:05:41.199> one<00:05:41.409> looks<00:05:41.590> the<00:05:41.830> best

00:05:42.029 --> 00:05:42.039 
figure out which one looks the best

00:05:42.039 --> 00:05:43.830 
figure out which one looks the best
because<00:05:42.310> sometimes<00:05:42.819> n<00:05:43.180> of<00:05:43.330> those<00:05:43.479> fluorescent

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:43.840 
because sometimes n of those fluorescent

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:46.350 
because sometimes n of those fluorescent
lights<00:05:44.349> it<00:05:44.590> can<00:05:44.770> kind<00:05:45.009> of<00:05:45.099> do<00:05:45.279> a<00:05:45.310> little<00:05:45.580> mind
