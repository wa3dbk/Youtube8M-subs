00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:13.170
 hi everyone knows that when we 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.000
 is found in a test video so of 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:19.880
 my new gamer headphones like I you 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:22.619
 so said the creative draco hs250 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:25.650
 so frozen received this morning so the day of 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:28.800
 christmas christmas by us so I bought it 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.070
 on cdiscount i will buy for 45 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.650
 euros 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.910
 what he looked really good so 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.530
 in this video I make you the 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.079
 test so first you can see that 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.840
 the packaging is really very good so 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:42.829
 a dragon's head so here it's 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:46.590
 the suffers like these it's a magnet 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:50.370
 so here you can already see that he 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.809
 there marked the purchased creative 850 was 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.420
 designed is set by the best 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.820
 designers of creative labs 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.030
 of acoustics and play to deliver a 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:02.190
 its most realistic environmental sound 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:05.369
 this is a little sentence his son the 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.630
 little can so already you can see 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:10.080
 that it's very good we pack and so 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:12.090
 already the microphone that in the middle as well as 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:19.049
 on both sides so the helmet with 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:22.640
 them the two auricles then on the 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:25.460
 side we will find too low explosive 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:27.840
 always the same little sentence leaving 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:31.290
 then last so you have a 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:33.210
 small enough detailed description so 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.880
 already I do not know if you have 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:38.130
 really see these are the 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.540
 extraordinary neodymium membrane 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.509
 locate the location 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.270
 exact of the enemy so already that's how it looks 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:47.040
 really not bad 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:49.110
 then removable microphone for a 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.280
 super owl helmet 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.380
 so that it's also not bad them huh 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.189
 because already the microphone wanted 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.380
 that it be removable 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:57.450
 because it's much better then 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.460
 with reversible rillettes that folds 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.240
 to facilitate storage not yet a 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.250
 not bad 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:07.350
 so you can see that she seems to have 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:08.960
 quickly to that so in Switzerland we can 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:12.410
 see 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:14.450
 so he also finally here I wanted 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:18.910
 not shown yet but here it is here 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:21.650
 a case so that's pure product sound 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:24.050
 the cuckoo shovels are finally making a heap 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.130
 of settings so the microphone that is 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:27.860
 detachable 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:30.560
 as you can see and whose 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:33.410
 atria that fold like that 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:36.140
 is to know who wins so when I 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:39.290
 you said so you can see these 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:42.290
 little hints here I do not know if 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:45.440
 you see very well and so I you 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:46.760
 propose to do in two the brooms I 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.530
 not going to do it by emptying because that 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.210
 will take too long and we get 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:54.440
 immediately found with the helmet 

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:57.670
 bullets and immediately so me 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:59.840
 here we are again so I removed the box 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:03.830
 which you can see that there are several 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:08.240
 parties so already there is a pocket of 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:10.790
 storage so black in matter a little bit of 

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:15.830
 leather so it's already handy for the 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:20.920
 tidy up then you're going to have so in 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:25.370
 it's the key 10 euros hard music 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:29.410
 that's not really what it is in 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:33.280
 our free audio or the pub is 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:33.280
 so the instructions for use 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:42.470
 so for 10 km 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:48.580
 so I 'm going to unfold it she has 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:48.580
 announced enough olala it's hyper m 

00:03:48.629 --> 00:04:04.299
 the other this announcement is so here I the 

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:08.170
 little box I thought he was 

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:10.150
 biggest but good things are going well you 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:14.019
 can see I do not know if you see 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:17.109
 very well so that's the microphone 

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:18.820
 if they are going to walk a step and 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:21.669
 that's the wanted ones so if you want 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:26.680
 adjust directly udder if you are 

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:27.310
 that we can see that there are two catches and 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:29.199
 then 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:33.639
 so I'm going to take off the headphones and the 

00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:39.360
 micro there so we can see that there is the 

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:39.360
 micro they attach at 3 pm 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:55.150
 so here is removing the bot 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:05:00.449
 so you have the microphone that is 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:05:03.310
 detachable and really removable so 

00:05:00.449 --> 00:05:05.320
 practical enough to guide his 

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:07.630
 Fang according to the size of the banks fall 

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:11.320
 or the positioning of the case and it's 

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:14.669
 so that's really a good background and 

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:14.669
 then the headphones 

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:23.289
 so here we can see that for the 

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:26.380
 design there is a kind of two bands 

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:28.180
 red on the good side honestly I 

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:31.270
 tell you that the dozen so zero and 

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:34.060
 can really but good for his 

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:35.289
 price performance including design 

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:37.690
 is quite simple as you can 

00:05:35.289 --> 00:05:41.169
 see it's pretty much normal everywhere 

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:43.060
 share his side of red stripes so for 

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:46.419
 cc ears 

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:48.400
 the type back reis lÃ¼thi pillow forgiveness 

00:05:46.419 --> 00:05:50.100
 who covers you all the ear so for 

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:53.110
 better immersion in the game 

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:54.430
 so then you see that there is 

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:59.460
 strengthening at the level of the head 

00:05:54.430 --> 00:06:03.460
 for more comfort here is so here 

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:12.460
 so there for the microphone the plug so I 

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:15.330
 the branch and so that's the microphone was 

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:15.330
 plugged in like this
