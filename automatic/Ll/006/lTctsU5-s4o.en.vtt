00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
like he just made me so ashy and I was

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.490 
like he just made me so ashy and I was
like<00:00:35.790> so<00:00:36.059> worried<00:00:36.329> about<00:00:36.570> using<00:00:37.110> it<00:00:37.230> I<00:00:37.350> was

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
like so worried about using it I was

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.049 
like so worried about using it I was
like<00:00:37.530> oh<00:00:37.710> this<00:00:37.890> is<00:00:38.040> never<00:00:38.309> gonna<00:00:38.520> work<00:00:38.640> for<00:00:39.030> me

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
like oh this is never gonna work for me

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.780 
like oh this is never gonna work for me
and<00:00:39.390> then<00:00:40.170> a<00:00:40.559> few<00:00:40.770> years<00:00:40.829> later<00:00:41.129> I<00:00:41.489> think<00:00:41.730> they

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
and then a few years later I think they

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.190 
and then a few years later I think they
came<00:00:42.000> out<00:00:42.030> with<00:00:42.210> a<00:00:42.360> kid<00:00:42.690> that<00:00:42.840> actually

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
came out with a kid that actually

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.740 
came out with a kid that actually
featured<00:00:43.559> more<00:00:43.920> darker<00:00:44.820> tone<00:00:45.090> so<00:00:45.450> I<00:00:45.480> was<00:00:45.570> using

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750

um<00:01:40.430> so<00:01:41.430> when<00:01:41.909> using<00:01:42.240> bare<00:01:42.420> minimums

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
um so when using bare minimums

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.690 
um so when using bare minimums
foundation<00:01:43.200> i<00:01:43.259> would<00:01:43.439> recommend<00:01:43.860> two<00:01:44.189> things

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
foundation i would recommend two things

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.120 
foundation i would recommend two things
and<00:01:44.939> the<00:01:45.030> first<00:01:45.270> thing<00:01:45.540> i<00:01:45.899> would<00:01:46.200> recommend<00:01:46.740> is

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
and the first thing i would recommend is

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.120 
and the first thing i would recommend is
a<00:01:47.640> setting<00:01:48.240> spray<00:01:48.390> so<00:01:48.899> this<00:01:49.110> is<00:01:49.140> alps<00:01:49.619> mineral

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
a setting spray so this is alps mineral

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.859 
a setting spray so this is alps mineral
setting<00:01:50.430> sprays<00:01:50.700> three<00:01:50.939> dollars<00:01:51.240> a<00:01:51.270> target<00:01:51.840> or

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
setting sprays three dollars a target or

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.499 
setting sprays three dollars a target or
on<00:01:52.170> the<00:01:52.290> eyes<00:01:52.439> lips<00:01:52.680> face<00:01:52.799> website<00:01:53.460> and<00:01:53.729> when

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
on the eyes lips face website and when

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.690 
on the eyes lips face website and when
you're<00:01:54.659> applying<00:01:54.869> this<00:01:55.259> you<00:01:55.470> can<00:01:55.860> i<00:01:56.310> don't

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
you're applying this you can i don't

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.730 
you're applying this you can i don't
know<00:01:56.790> i<00:01:56.820> just<00:01:56.969> i<00:01:57.299> think<00:01:57.360> i'm<00:01:57.750> used<00:01:57.990> to<00:01:58.200> using<00:01:58.439> it

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
know i just i think i'm used to using it

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.469 
know i just i think i'm used to using it
anyway<00:01:59.040> because<00:01:59.430> when<00:01:59.700> I<00:01:59.880> originally<00:02:00.180> was

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
anyway because when I originally was

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.389 
anyway because when I originally was
using<00:02:00.750> bare<00:02:00.869> minerals<00:02:01.259> they<00:02:01.860> only<00:02:02.009> have<00:02:02.280> this

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
using bare minerals they only have this

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.190 
using bare minerals they only have this
one<00:02:02.460> color<00:02:02.909> that<00:02:03.090> wasn't<00:02:03.420> quite<00:02:03.509> right<00:02:03.840> for<00:02:03.899> my

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
one color that wasn't quite right for my

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.800 
one color that wasn't quite right for my
skin<00:02:04.469> tone<00:02:04.740> and<00:02:05.130> I<00:02:06.060> would<00:02:06.240> still<00:02:06.420> get<00:02:06.509> a<00:02:06.570> little

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
skin tone and I would still get a little

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.359 
skin tone and I would still get a little
bit<00:02:06.899> as<00:02:07.049> she<00:02:07.350> so<00:02:07.500> I<00:02:07.530> would<00:02:07.710> like<00:02:07.860> spray<00:02:08.160> it<00:02:08.220> on

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
bit as she so I would like spray it on

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:09.300 
bit as she so I would like spray it on
and<00:02:08.399> that<00:02:08.670> just<00:02:08.910> takes

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310 
and that just takes

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:10.650 
and that just takes
so<00:02:09.550> if<00:02:09.610> you<00:02:09.700> ever<00:02:09.910> feel<00:02:10.270> like<00:02:10.330> you're<00:02:10.539> running
