00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:09.030
 did not think did not guess 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:11.639
 but what kind of gadget we found at the exhibition 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.200
 mvc 2014 is droider.ru 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.990
 and we continue to look at different 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.330
 interesting novelties and unexpectedly company 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.180
 ford force introduced its new ford 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.199
 focus 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:25.109
 naturally we will not understand too 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.609
 unified suspension force wheels radiators 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.890
 and other automotive terms 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.510
 we look at the technical stuffing it 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.730
 car besides for this very 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.980
 reason for it and submitted to the mobile 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.630
 congress because the car is stuffed 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.430
 different sensors of different electronics 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:42.030
 for example on this poster we see 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:44.100
 that there are as many as 18 radars here 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.140
 side radars that feel 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.390
 when the car is approaching from the sides and 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.890
 start cars starts beeping appeared 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.739
 two rear radar which is now 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.670
 allow the car to park 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:55.110
 perpendicular that is earlier she knew how 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.670
 automatically park when 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.640
 parallel parking 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.829
 and now with perpendicular 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.960
 one more trick there is such a chip which 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.150
 called active city stop using 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.580
 these cameras and radar she defines 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:11.070
 distance to the nearest car if 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.540
 the distance is so great that it can 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.180
 car crash occur 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.070
 automatically stops in the city 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.479
 such a thing very well saves 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.340
 especially if you're in traffic for example 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.470
 fell asleep and the car itself could roll 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.240
 embed for example nearest another 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.549
 the car will automatically stop and 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.430
 you will avoid accidents so well now let's 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:32.250
 look at the car itself its design 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.900
 changed the beautiful new grille almost 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.030
 same as ford mondeo 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.729
 headlights such tech that's the way 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:41.790
 speaking here we see several sensors in 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:43.770
 including the radar camera so well actually 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.930
 otherwise it â€™s still ordinary 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.210
 car let's see what he has 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.460
 inside there is an updated system 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:53.549
 which is called sing 2 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:55.079
 she has a voice control principle 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:57.600
 many machines from voice control but 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:02:01.219
 not all cars can drive 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.219
 voice for example navigation system 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:19.930
 angry sky and now the car 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:21.850
 must find cafes and fast food restaurants 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:23.890
 who are nearby need just 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:26.440
 just say I'm hungry and smart 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:28.180
 machines will understand everything for example to build 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.190
 no route to burger king or to 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.410
 some social restaurant with 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:34.420
 hryvnia please everything work except 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:36.100
 addition there is a screen now touch on it 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.850
 you can click here and so poke here 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.830
 in this way 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:41.170
 There is a button house which allows 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:42.880
 get some sort of main menu 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:44.410
 it turns out so now technology 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:46.450
 which were previously available on 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:48.880
 approximate cars goes into the car 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:51.400
 more budget for example here's how ford 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:53.230
 focus and great the technical 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.680
 filling them so much except ford 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:55.780
 focus 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:58.360
 at the ford stand and still stands 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:01.000
 very interesting car is 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:02.800
 hybrid ford mondeo such all in Russia 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.630
 No, and in Europe there is no role in America 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:06.250
 there are now most 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:09.250
 car manufacturers try 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:11.110
 finally do autopilot and and here 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:13.209
 just as you see on the roof stand 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:15.610
 special radars that protrude from 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:17.560
 car as eyes they build around 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:19.690
 real-time terrain map and 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:21.760
 car can literally see what 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:24.610
 It is happening and understand where to go and 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:27.250
 where it is not yet natural 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:28.810
 experimental sample him him yet 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:30.070
 until you let go of the city so he is there 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:32.620
 traveled without a pilot 

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:35.230
 but soon I think already such 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:37.450
 things won't seem new as 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:38.920
 see now the screen displays as 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:41.260
 cars see the world around 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:44.290
 I'm waving my hands right here 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:46.690
 about his radar there on my screen 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:47.920
 such a purple twin these actions 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:49.810
 basically all of this is repeated 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:52.300
 happens fast enough as you can see 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:54.850
 virtually no dead spots where you can 

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:56.769
 like to get up the radar everything punches even 

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:57.610
 when we hide behind metal 

00:03:56.769 --> 00:04:00.340
 trunk lid 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:02.260
 anyway, he sees it at all global 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:04.420
 automaker's ideas is 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.870
 that cars in the future will be smart they 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:07.090
 will be able to 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:09.100
 communicate with each other telling one 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:10.819
 other if she had an accident report 

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:13.249
 about traffic jams and man, in principle, do not need 

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:14.629
 will even bother with it all 

00:04:13.249 --> 00:04:16.669
 will make a car he will 

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:19.310
 clever, he can come to the aid of 

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:22.039
 to your friend if he broke the tire well 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:23.449
 in short, there will simply be such a world 

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:25.310
 when you will not click 

00:04:23.449 --> 00:04:27.500
 pedal car will take you to 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:29.180
 work and choose the best 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:30.500
 the route is naturally quantity 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:32.120
 traffic jams should decrease because 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:33.650
 human factor is excluded 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:35.300
 to make the car really 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:38.720
 smart so she herself 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:40.729
 managed to go everywhere she needed brains and these 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:42.770
 brains are here in the trunk like 

00:04:40.729 --> 00:04:45.620
 see now they do n't look that good 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:47.210
 compact half place is taken 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:48.830
 was ford company booth review 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:50.479
 prepared Valery Sischev 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:52.639
 and Boris Vedensky, I hope that 

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:55.190
 the following shows will appear more 

00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:57.080
 smarter cars and generally this trend 

00:04:55.190 --> 00:05:03.949
 continue and we continue to search 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:04.870
 interesting gadgets attention is not plastic 

00:05:03.949 --> 00:05:11.289
 did under the skin 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:11.289
 even comet metal premium material
