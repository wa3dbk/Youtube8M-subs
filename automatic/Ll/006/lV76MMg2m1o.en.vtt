00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
but it's also got that steampunk edge to

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:23.760 
but it's also got that steampunk edge to
it<00:02:21.550> and<00:02:21.850> it<00:02:22.090> can<00:02:22.240> be<00:02:22.450> a<00:02:22.480> bit<00:02:22.720> edgier<00:02:22.900> a<00:02:23.320> bit<00:02:23.620> more

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:23.770 
it and it can be a bit edgier a bit more

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:26.310 
it and it can be a bit edgier a bit more
dangerous<00:02:23.920> and<00:02:24.430> because<00:02:25.270> it<00:02:25.420> with<00:02:25.750> the<00:02:25.990> sexual

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:26.320 
dangerous and because it with the sexual

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:27.570 
dangerous and because it with the sexual
themes<00:02:26.620> in<00:02:26.770> it<00:02:26.890> as<00:02:27.010> well<00:02:27.160> there's<00:02:27.400> something

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.580 
themes in it as well there's something

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:29.250 
themes in it as well there's something
that's<00:02:27.850> you<00:02:28.240> know<00:02:28.360> should<00:02:28.750> be<00:02:28.780> should<00:02:29.170> be

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
that's you know should be should be

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.560 
that's you know should be should be
talked<00:02:29.470> about<00:02:29.560> more<00:02:29.740> than<00:02:30.100> embrace<00:02:30.640> more<00:02:30.910> so<00:02:31.540> I

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:31.570 
talked about more than embrace more so I

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:34.500 
talked about more than embrace more so I
think<00:02:31.750> yeah<00:02:32.290> I<00:02:32.650> mean<00:02:32.880> we'd<00:02:33.880> have<00:02:33.910> to<00:02:34.030> see<00:02:34.330> we'd

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
think yeah I mean we'd have to see we'd

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:36.210 
think yeah I mean we'd have to see we'd
have<00:02:34.660> to<00:02:34.780> be<00:02:34.959> what<00:02:35.230> what<00:02:35.560> sort<00:02:35.800> of<00:02:35.860> ideas

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
have to be what what sort of ideas

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:37.740 
have to be what what sort of ideas

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
people can come up with because it's

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:40.860
