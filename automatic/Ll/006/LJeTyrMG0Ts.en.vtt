00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.500 
it takes a long time to to get the curls
to<00:02:11.550> hold<00:02:11.900> but<00:02:12.900> I'm<00:02:13.860> going<00:02:14.400> to<00:02:14.459> go<00:02:14.760> ahead<00:02:14.880> and

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
to hold but I'm going to go ahead and

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.460 
to hold but I'm going to go ahead and
use<00:02:16.410> the<00:02:17.010> dryer<00:02:17.370> on<00:02:17.730> the<00:02:18.120> highest<00:02:18.690> setting<00:02:19.260> on

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
use the dryer on the highest setting on

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.920 
use the dryer on the highest setting on
the<00:02:19.830> hottest<00:02:20.040> setting<00:02:20.549> as<00:02:20.760> well<00:02:20.790> so<00:02:21.600> because

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
the hottest setting as well so because

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:23.990 
the hottest setting as well so because
this<00:02:22.049> is<00:02:22.110> noisy<00:02:22.709> and<00:02:22.739> you<00:02:22.920> probably<00:02:23.370> won't<00:02:23.790> be

this is noisy and you probably won't be

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.759 
this is noisy and you probably won't be
able<00:02:24.120> to<00:02:24.180> hear<00:02:24.420> what<00:02:24.540> I'm<00:02:24.660> saying<00:02:24.989> go<00:02:25.650> ahead

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:24.050 
for them to cool down which probably

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:25.780 
for them to cool down which probably
takes<00:04:24.230> about<00:04:24.320> 10<00:04:24.620> minutes<00:04:24.650> you're<00:04:25.550> just<00:04:25.700> gonna

00:04:35.409 --> 00:04:35.419 
to get the waves is take take one of

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:39.909 
to get the waves is take take one of
these<00:04:35.630> curls<00:04:37.090> the<00:04:38.090> dreads<00:04:38.419> and<00:04:38.810> just<00:04:39.530> kind<00:04:39.800> of

00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:39.919 
these curls the dreads and just kind of

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:47.070 
these curls the dreads and just kind of
like<00:04:40.300> gently<00:04:41.300> split<00:04:41.990> them<00:04:42.230> apart<00:04:42.320> like<00:04:42.889> that

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:47.080 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:49.360 

you're<00:04:48.080> gonna<00:04:48.200> want<00:04:48.470> to<00:04:48.560> do<00:04:48.680> that<00:04:48.830> maybe<00:04:49.010> one

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:49.370 
you're gonna want to do that maybe one

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:52.450 
you're gonna want to do that maybe one
or<00:04:49.490> two<00:04:49.639> times<00:04:49.910> per<00:04:50.570> dread<00:04:51.139> don't<00:04:52.040> do<00:04:52.160> it<00:04:52.280> too

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:52.460 
or two times per dread don't do it too

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:54.190 
or two times per dread don't do it too
much<00:04:52.729> because<00:04:53.000> you<00:04:53.240> still<00:04:53.510> want<00:04:53.540> it<00:04:53.870> to<00:04:54.020> hold

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:54.200 
much because you still want it to hold

00:04:54.200 --> 00:05:01.750 
much because you still want it to hold
some<00:04:55.040> of<00:04:55.070> its<00:04:55.370> um<00:04:55.840> curl<00:04:56.840> together<00:05:00.639> but<00:05:01.639> you're

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:01.760 
some of its um curl together but you're

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:04.000 
some of its um curl together but you're
just<00:05:01.970> going<00:05:02.120> to<00:05:02.300> separate<00:05:02.660> them<00:05:02.870> into<00:05:03.410> like

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:04.010 
just going to separate them into like

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:26.740 
just going to separate them into like
smaller<00:05:04.430> chunks

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:26.750 

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:28.960 

so<00:05:27.290> there's<00:05:27.530> the<00:05:27.770> difference<00:05:27.800> between<00:05:28.520> this

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:28.970 
so there's the difference between this

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:34.180 
so there's the difference between this
side<00:05:29.330> and<00:05:29.360> I've<00:05:29.990> taken<00:05:30.290> apart<00:05:32.830> and<00:05:33.830> then<00:05:33.890> this

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:34.190 
side and I've taken apart and then this

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:41.490 
side and I've taken apart and then this
side<00:05:34.400> that's<00:05:34.580> stolen<00:05:35.060> dreads

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:41.500 

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:44.520 

so<00:05:42.490> this<00:05:42.670> is<00:05:42.850> the<00:05:43.000> final<00:05:43.450> look<00:05:43.630> I<00:05:43.810> get<00:05:44.050> when<00:05:44.380> I'm

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:44.530 
so this is the final look I get when I'm

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:51.480 
so this is the final look I get when I'm
done<00:05:48.480> if<00:05:49.480> you<00:05:50.200> want<00:05:50.350> it<00:05:50.560> to<00:05:50.680> stay<00:05:50.950> longer<00:05:51.280> you

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:51.490 
done if you want it to stay longer you

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:54.330 
done if you want it to stay longer you
can<00:05:51.940> you<00:05:52.390> know<00:05:52.510> use<00:05:52.720> some<00:05:52.750> hairspray<00:05:53.380> either

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:54.340 
can you know use some hairspray either

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:56.960 
can you know use some hairspray either
before<00:05:54.940> you<00:05:55.060> start<00:05:55.330> the<00:05:55.450> curls<00:05:55.720> or<00:05:55.990> afterwards

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:56.970 
before you start the curls or afterwards

00:05:56.970 --> 00:06:00.660 
before you start the curls or afterwards

hair spin around you don't do anything

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:00.270 
hair spin around you don't do anything
you<00:06:58.720> just<00:06:58.930> sit<00:06:59.050> there<00:06:59.260> for<00:06:59.590> a<00:06:59.620> couple<00:06:59.680> minutes

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:00.280 
you just sit there for a couple minutes

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:03.480 
you just sit there for a couple minutes
for<00:07:00.400> each<00:07:00.610> chunk<00:07:01.150> and<00:07:01.360> then<00:07:01.870> it's<00:07:02.620> done<00:07:02.890> for

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:03.490 
for each chunk and then it's done for

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:06.480 
for each chunk and then it's done for
the<00:07:04.270> coolness<00:07:04.870> factor<00:07:05.320> of<00:07:05.740> the<00:07:05.919> hair<00:07:06.220> that<00:07:06.430> you

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:06.490 
the coolness factor of the hair that you

00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:09.540 
the coolness factor of the hair that you
get<00:07:06.700> in<00:07:06.820> the<00:07:06.910> end<00:07:07.620> it<00:07:08.620> really<00:07:08.890> doesn't<00:07:09.340> take<00:07:09.400> a

00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:09.550 
get in the end it really doesn't take a

00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:11.580 
get in the end it really doesn't take a
lot<00:07:09.850> of<00:07:10.030> efforts<00:07:10.450> I<00:07:10.750> think<00:07:10.780> anybody<00:07:11.290> could<00:07:11.440> do

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:11.590 
lot of efforts I think anybody could do

00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:14.190 
lot of efforts I think anybody could do
that<00:07:11.620> so<00:07:12.430> because<00:07:12.669> of<00:07:13.090> that<00:07:13.120> and<00:07:13.600> because<00:07:14.050> it's

00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:14.200 
that so because of that and because it's

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:16.430
