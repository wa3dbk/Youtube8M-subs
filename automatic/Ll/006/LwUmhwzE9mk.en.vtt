00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:04.140 
this is my new to me

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.430 
this is my new to me
Ross<00:00:04.470> bike<00:00:05.029> I've<00:00:06.029> got<00:00:06.270> it<00:00:06.480> hanging<00:00:07.080> from<00:00:07.259> the

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:07.440 
Ross bike I've got it hanging from the

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.419 
Ross bike I've got it hanging from the
old<00:00:07.589> pull-up<00:00:08.069> bar<00:00:08.780> that's<00:00:09.780> my<00:00:10.050> work<00:00:10.710> stand<00:00:11.160> and

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
old pull-up bar that's my work stand and

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.140 
old pull-up bar that's my work stand and
I've<00:00:12.360> got<00:00:12.570> the<00:00:12.750> back<00:00:12.960> tire<00:00:13.290> removed<00:00:13.980> the<00:00:14.940> tube

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
I've got the back tire removed the tube

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:20.029 
I've got the back tire removed the tube
is<00:00:15.389> off<00:00:15.599> and<00:00:15.929> the<00:00:18.050> we<00:00:19.050> call<00:00:19.230> that<00:00:19.410> the<00:00:19.470> rim<00:00:19.770> tape

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
is off and the we call that the rim tape

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.019 
is off and the we call that the rim tape
is<00:00:20.369> out<00:00:20.820> of<00:00:20.850> it<00:00:21.119> and<00:00:22.250> there's<00:00:23.250> the<00:00:23.460> reflector

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
is out of it and there's the reflector

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.900 
is out of it and there's the reflector
there<00:00:24.300> you'll<00:00:24.600> notice<00:00:24.859> there's<00:00:25.859> no<00:00:26.189> reflector

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
there you'll notice there's no reflector

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.220 
there you'll notice there's no reflector
in<00:00:27.920> the<00:00:28.920> back<00:00:29.130> wheel<00:00:29.960> see<00:00:30.960> there<00:00:31.080> is<00:00:31.199> a

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
in the back wheel see there is a

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.709 
in the back wheel see there is a
reflector<00:00:31.740> in<00:00:31.830> the<00:00:31.920> front<00:00:32.420> now<00:00:33.420> the<00:00:33.480> back

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
reflector in the front now the back

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.650 
reflector in the front now the back
wheels<00:00:33.989> in<00:00:34.170> the<00:00:34.320> air<00:00:34.350> I<00:00:35.210> mess<00:00:36.210> up<00:00:36.390> the<00:00:36.480> camera

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
wheels in the air I mess up the camera

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.010 
wheels in the air I mess up the camera
down<00:00:36.989> and<00:00:37.320> pedal<00:00:38.280> it<00:00:38.430> up<00:00:38.579> I've<00:00:39.450> got<00:00:39.690> it's<00:00:39.809> been

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
down and pedal it up I've got it's been

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.950 
down and pedal it up I've got it's been
a<00:00:40.579> high<00:00:41.579> gear<00:00:41.850> on<00:00:42.000> the<00:00:42.149> back<00:00:42.300> and<00:00:42.510> low<00:00:42.660> gear<00:00:42.870> in

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
a high gear on the back and low gear in

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.709 
a high gear on the back and low gear in
the<00:00:43.079> front<00:00:43.110> so<00:00:43.680> I'll<00:00:44.010> get<00:00:44.219> the<00:00:44.340> rim<00:00:44.719> spinning

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
the front so I'll get the rim spinning

00:00:45.719 --> 00:01:15.340 
the front so I'll get the rim spinning
pretty<00:00:46.020> fast<00:00:46.289> for<00:00:46.710> ya

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:15.350 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:19.360 

and<00:01:15.860> as<00:01:15.980> you<00:01:16.130> can<00:01:16.220> see<00:01:16.280> that<00:01:16.580> spins<00:01:16.970> up<00:01:18.370> very

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:19.370 
and as you can see that spins up very

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:22.450 
and as you can see that spins up very
nice<00:01:19.640> and<00:01:19.940> spins<00:01:20.210> nice<00:01:20.450> and<00:01:20.690> smooth<00:01:20.990> and<00:01:21.460> I've

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:22.460 
nice and spins nice and smooth and I've

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.490 
nice and spins nice and smooth and I've
been<00:01:22.610> I've<00:01:23.000> been<00:01:23.030> true<00:01:23.300> in<00:01:23.420> this<00:01:23.540> wheel<00:01:23.810> so<00:01:24.200> I

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:24.500 
been I've been true in this wheel so I

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:29.590 
been I've been true in this wheel so I
don't<00:01:25.430> wobble<00:01:25.640> it<00:01:25.910> all<00:01:27.940> and<00:01:28.940> it's<00:01:29.120> also<00:01:29.300> nice

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:29.600 
don't wobble it all and it's also nice

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.080 
don't wobble it all and it's also nice
and<00:01:29.780> round<00:01:30.050> -<00:01:30.380> there's<00:01:30.620> no<00:01:30.800> bumps<00:01:31.550> in<00:01:31.700> it

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:32.090 
and round - there's no bumps in it

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:40.390 
and round - there's no bumps in it
no<00:01:32.930> major<00:01:33.140> bumps<00:01:33.650> anyway<00:01:37.450> now<00:01:38.450> I<00:01:39.220> like<00:01:40.220> what

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:40.400 
no major bumps anyway now I like what

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:41.830 
no major bumps anyway now I like what
the<00:01:40.490> reflector<00:01:40.940> on<00:01:41.120> you<00:01:41.240> I<00:01:41.300> want<00:01:41.479> to<00:01:41.510> watch<00:01:41.660> me

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:41.840 
the reflector on you I want to watch me

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.000 
the reflector on you I want to watch me
do<00:01:41.990> that<00:01:42.170> though<00:01:44.229> okay<00:01:45.229> now<00:01:45.620> I<00:01:45.650> got<00:01:45.860> the

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:46.010 
do that though okay now I got the

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:48.490 
do that though okay now I got the
reflector<00:01:46.520> on<00:01:46.670> there<00:01:46.970> and<00:01:47.330> as<00:01:48.020> you<00:01:48.110> can<00:01:48.200> see<00:01:48.470> I

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:48.500 
reflector on there and as you can see I

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.850 
reflector on there and as you can see I
still<00:01:48.860> don't<00:01:49.070> have<00:01:49.160> the<00:01:49.340> tyre<00:01:49.550> the<00:01:49.940> rim<00:01:50.590> or<00:01:51.590> the

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:51.860 
still don't have the tyre the rim or the

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:54.640 
still don't have the tyre the rim or the
rim<00:01:52.040> tape<00:01:52.340> on<00:01:52.759> there<00:01:53.330> I<00:01:53.570> just<00:01:54.320> put<00:01:54.530> the

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:54.650 
rim tape on there I just put the

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:56.740 
rim tape on there I just put the
reflector<00:01:55.160> on<00:01:55.369> and<00:01:55.970> it's<00:01:56.119> just<00:01:56.240> an<00:01:56.509> ordinary

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:56.750 
reflector on and it's just an ordinary

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:01.480 
reflector on and it's just an ordinary
reflector<00:01:57.680> I<00:01:58.009> made<00:01:58.880> a<00:01:58.910> plastic<00:01:59.479> and<00:02:00.340> it's<00:02:01.340> got

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.490 
reflector I made a plastic and it's got

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:06.160 
reflector I made a plastic and it's got
a<00:02:01.520> little<00:02:01.759> plastic<00:02:03.550> clip<00:02:04.660> thing<00:02:05.660> there<00:02:05.900> that

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.170 
a little plastic clip thing there that

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:08.469 
a little plastic clip thing there that
holds<00:02:06.440> it<00:02:06.530> on<00:02:06.710> I<00:02:07.009> just<00:02:07.850> flipped<00:02:08.060> it<00:02:08.149> on<00:02:08.270> down

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 
holds it on I just flipped it on down

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:14.550 
holds it on I just flipped it on down
one<00:02:09.440> spoke<00:02:10.300> normal<00:02:11.300> spoke<00:02:12.010> and<00:02:13.010> now<00:02:13.280> let<00:02:13.520> me

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
one spoke normal spoke and now let me

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:41.480 
one spoke normal spoke and now let me
spin<00:02:15.560> that<00:02:15.709> wheel<00:02:15.890> up<00:02:16.190> for<00:02:16.459> you

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:41.490 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:44.480 

now<00:02:42.060> I<00:02:42.090> may<00:02:42.540> not<00:02:42.690> have<00:02:42.840> spun<00:02:43.200> it<00:02:43.350> perfectly<00:02:44.250> as

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:44.490 
now I may not have spun it perfectly as

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:48.950 
now I may not have spun it perfectly as
fast<00:02:44.790> both<00:02:45.150> times<00:02:45.560> but<00:02:46.560> as<00:02:46.710> you<00:02:46.860> can<00:02:47.010> see<00:02:47.960> that

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:48.960 
fast both times but as you can see that

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.690 
fast both times but as you can see that
bike<00:02:49.200> is<00:02:49.350> bouncing<00:02:49.830> all<00:02:49.950> over<00:02:49.980> the<00:02:50.190> place<00:02:50.280> now

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
bike is bouncing all over the place now

00:02:50.700 --> 00:03:00.580 
bike is bouncing all over the place now
that<00:02:50.730> reflectors<00:02:51.570> on<00:02:51.840> there<00:02:55.310> a<00:02:56.990> reflector

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:02.960 

must<00:03:01.590> weigh<00:03:01.800> just<00:03:01.830> enough<00:03:02.340> to<00:03:02.550> throw<00:03:02.820> the

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
must weigh just enough to throw the

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:08.600 
must weigh just enough to throw the
balance<00:03:03.300> off<00:03:03.480> the<00:03:03.690> wheel<00:03:07.100> it<00:03:08.100> is<00:03:08.280> a<00:03:08.310> safety

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
balance off the wheel it is a safety

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:10.400 
balance off the wheel it is a safety
measure<00:03:08.970> but<00:03:09.390> I<00:03:09.420> think<00:03:09.720> I<00:03:09.810> might<00:03:09.960> take<00:03:10.170> it<00:03:10.230> off

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
measure but I think I might take it off

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:14.060 
measure but I think I might take it off
of<00:03:10.620> there<00:03:10.740> because<00:03:10.920> I<00:03:12.710> think<00:03:13.710> I<00:03:13.800> want<00:03:13.980> the

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:14.070 
of there because I think I want the

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:16.310 
of there because I think I want the
wheel<00:03:14.250> to<00:03:14.430> be<00:03:14.460> balanced<00:03:15.060> nicely<00:03:15.630> like<00:03:16.050> it<00:03:16.200> was

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:16.320 
wheel to be balanced nicely like it was

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:20.180 
wheel to be balanced nicely like it was
without<00:03:16.560> the<00:03:16.710> reflector<00:03:17.370> I<00:03:19.130> don't<00:03:20.130> know

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
without the reflector I don't know

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:21.380 
without the reflector I don't know
that's<00:03:20.310> just<00:03:20.490> something<00:03:20.880> for<00:03:21.030> you<00:03:21.090> to<00:03:21.180> think

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390 
that's just something for you to think

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:24.110 
that's just something for you to think
about<00:03:21.510> I<00:03:21.690> guess<00:03:22.430> might<00:03:23.430> be<00:03:23.550> worth<00:03:23.700> taking<00:03:23.910> the

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
about I guess might be worth taking the
