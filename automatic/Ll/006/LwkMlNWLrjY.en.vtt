00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.480 
millimeter F 1 point 8 we have F 1.8
available<00:01:55.170> to<00:01:55.290> us<00:01:55.380> it's<00:01:55.560> dim<00:01:55.770> in<00:01:55.890> this<00:01:56.009> room<00:01:56.189> so

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
available to us it's dim in this room so

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.920 
available to us it's dim in this room so
why<00:01:56.909> don't<00:01:57.180> we<00:01:57.710> set<00:01:58.710> the<00:01:58.829> lens<00:01:59.009> at<00:01:59.189> F<00:01:59.310> 1<00:01:59.460> point<00:01:59.700> 8

00:01:59.920 --> 00:01:59.930 
why don't we set the lens at F 1 point 8

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:03.760 
why don't we set the lens at F 1 point 8
so<00:02:00.930> we<00:02:01.079> can<00:02:01.229> control<00:02:01.500> aperture<00:02:01.920> from<00:02:02.040> the<00:02:02.219> app

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 
so we can control aperture from the app

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:05.630 
so we can control aperture from the app
right<00:02:04.770> here<00:02:04.829> in<00:02:05.040> the<00:02:05.100> center<00:02:05.399> we<00:02:05.610> have

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
right here in the center we have

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.210 
right here in the center we have
exposure<00:02:06.149> compensation<00:02:06.770> super<00:02:07.770> cool<00:02:07.950> so

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
exposure compensation super cool so

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.889 
exposure compensation super cool so
let's<00:02:08.250> crank<00:02:08.670> that<00:02:08.849> up<00:02:09.090> here<00:02:09.300> it's<00:02:09.450> darkroom

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
let's crank that up here it's darkroom

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.740 
let's crank that up here it's darkroom
whoa<00:02:10.770> a<00:02:11.520> little<00:02:11.790> too<00:02:11.970> bright

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
whoa a little too bright

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.210 
whoa a little too bright
dialer<00:02:13.260> back<00:02:13.440> down<00:02:13.650> here<00:02:13.860> go<00:02:14.100> back<00:02:14.220> to<00:02:14.570> here

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
dialer back down here go back to here

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:20.110 
dialer back down here go back to here

kind<00:02:21.120> of<00:02:21.270> cool<00:02:21.390> that<00:02:21.510> we<00:02:21.600> can<00:02:21.780> do<00:02:21.900> this<00:02:22.460> so

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:23.460 
kind of cool that we can do this so

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:24.920 
kind of cool that we can do this so
let's<00:02:23.640> bring<00:02:23.970> it<00:02:24.090> right<00:02:24.210> back<00:02:24.270> down<00:02:24.660> here<00:02:24.840> to

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
let's bring it right back down here to

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.490 
let's bring it right back down here to
ISO<00:02:25.320> 200<00:02:26.210> we<00:02:27.210> also<00:02:27.390> have<00:02:27.630> available<00:02:28.140> to<00:02:28.320> us

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
white balance settings you know like

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.140 
white balance settings you know like

preset<00:02:40.010> so<00:02:41.010> let<00:02:41.130> me<00:02:41.220> get<00:02:41.370> out<00:02:41.490> of<00:02:41.610> there<00:02:41.730> we'll

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
preset so let me get out of there we'll

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.790 
preset so let me get out of there we'll
go<00:02:42.750> back<00:02:42.900> to<00:02:43.170> auto<00:02:43.650> there<00:02:44.490> we<00:02:44.610> go<00:02:44.730> and<00:02:45.800> what

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
go back to auto there we go and what

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.340 
go back to auto there we go and what
else<00:02:46.950> can<00:02:47.070> we<00:02:47.250> do<00:02:47.780> upper<00:02:48.780> right-hand<00:02:48.959> corner

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
else can we do upper right-hand corner

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:52.430 
else can we do upper right-hand corner
here<00:02:49.739> you<00:02:50.489> can<00:02:50.640> see<00:02:50.790> a<00:02:50.820> a<00:02:51.060> that<00:02:51.540> a<00:02:51.570> is<00:02:52.080> for

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
here you can see a a that a is for

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.110 
here you can see a a that a is for
aperture<00:02:52.890> priority<00:02:53.130> so<00:02:53.640> we<00:02:53.790> can<00:02:53.940> actually

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
aperture priority so we can actually

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.510 
aperture priority so we can actually
switch<00:02:54.510> between<00:02:54.720> modes<00:02:55.140> via<00:02:55.470> the<00:02:55.980> Wi-Fi

can<00:03:13.410> adjust<00:03:13.680> the<00:03:13.800> timer<00:03:14.040> again<00:03:14.489> the<00:03:14.820> different

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:15.709 
can adjust the timer again the different

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:17.690 
can adjust the timer again the different

from good grief from two seconds to 12
seconds<00:03:23.450> there<00:03:24.450> we<00:03:24.570> go<00:03:24.750> make<00:03:24.989> a<00:03:25.019> single<00:03:25.440> shot

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
seconds there we go make a single shot

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:29.539 
seconds there we go make a single shot
and<00:03:25.920> again<00:03:26.850> just<00:03:27.269> like<00:03:27.540> the<00:03:28.310> just<00:03:29.310> like<00:03:29.400> the
