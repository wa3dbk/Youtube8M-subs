00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:08.400

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:11.880
 I want to make such a video about my varnishes 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:14.460
 for nail firm opera will tell you 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:18.380

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:21.210
 money here and also you will find out 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:23.820
 pruning and lipstick company mary kay 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.710
 also tell you my opinion 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.949
 there were some new things and 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:31.560
 actually you will see them will show 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:34.739
 swatches of course well and also just 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:37.290
 talk about products and so don't 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:40.739
 I can say now like a story about 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:44.040
 again and I actually have very little 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:49.530
 their funds are literally four means and 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:53.879
 my opinion about them before tell you first 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:55.860
 this one is such a bright red even 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.469
 said about going to coral 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:02.699
 I have such nail polish 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:05.280
 the palette on which I draw all my 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:07.979
 likes that I bought and this one here 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:13.100
 He will look at his nails 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:13.100
 something like this is very nice by the way 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:24.119
 it has creamy consistency 

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:28.979
 from the first time he lies down enough 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:31.259
 well that is not strip at the same time 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:38.430
 dry it well, probably five minutes for 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:42.150
 6 2 layers gives a brighter coverage when 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:45.899
 this he has his good shimmer 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:47.970
 glossy at the end already and I like it 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.979
 find something when you put it on 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.930
 but kitty when automatically 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:54.450
 spreads all over the nail and not 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.159
 it turns out that he lies down in stripes 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.320
 exactly uniform application 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:01.530
 and at the same time it aligns 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.750
 the structure of the nail is written here for 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:07.200
 quick-drying nail contains 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:09.539
 natural silk but what about silk ilya not 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.930
 I read the composition especially here it is somehow not 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:17.700
 I saw but he really 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:21.060
 varnish remarkably good lies course 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:23.910
 for 400 rubles he is a sorcerer and what is it 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:28.080
 too expensive for lacquer i have here 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:30.200
 still here is such a varnish, too, the bottle goes 15 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:33.150
 milliliters is such a chocolate shade 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:36.090
 and it looks just brown on 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:39.150
 in fact there are golden inside 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:43.440
 glitter and under different lighting it me 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:45.959
 this is this fruit its color with brown 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:48.780
 on beige that is very beautiful 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:51.000
 overflow is obtained as a result here you can 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:56.480
 even here see candles drown white 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:03:00.349
 a little golden this color here 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:04.200
 it looks like this chocolate color 

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:08.250
 the length of the sun shimmer is very very beautiful 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:12.090
 15 milliliters look here in these 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:16.350
 lacquers I think that in principle for the eyes and 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:19.650
 even more that is actually here 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:22.590
 This varnish is probably one bottle 15 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:24.690
 milliliters otitis for a long time on 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:26.819
 several years if considering what is wrong 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:28.980
 I often paint my nails and even just 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:32.579
 girls lakomanyak he who constantly 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:34.769
 changing color i think some of the varnish can 

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:36.079
 dry in a box just because 

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:41.730
 lots of 

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:43.590
 millimeters big milliliters another 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:45.930
 means that i have it 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:46.859
 means I really hoped for him when 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:50.880
 bought it 

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:54.599
 called start and finish ie it is 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:56.790
 pre-coating agent 

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:58.060
 manicure to use as 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:00.010
 base and after 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:05.400
 applying manicure on the glossy finish 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:07.630
 in fact it seems to me that he 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:10.030
 little can not cope with their 

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:12.550
 functions because usually from the base 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:15.670
 cover what requirements impose 

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:19.180
 so that firstly the nails do not turn yellow when 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:22.960
 you paint bright color to lion fist 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:27.900
 then filmed and that's how the top 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:31.500
 Coverage well to gloss was bright and 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:33.370
 lacquer color preserved better 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:36.790
 accordingly so that he is not long 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:38.530
 refused and did not wash off this one 

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:41.290
 funds for of course 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:44.470
 principle is normal but i can same 

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:47.740
 buy rubles for 50 for 60 exactly 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:50.020
 the same functions, that is, and I do not think that 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:53.290
 he performs his functions here because 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:55.000
 that the nails from him still turn yellow then 

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:57.430
 have local somehow seeps through 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.169
 uid cover nails still turn yellow like 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:02.250
 top finish it is not 

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:05.560
 protects your nails from premature 

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:07.539
 prone to say that is but enough 

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:09.789
 fast and self coating top varnish 

00:05:07.539 --> 00:05:12.990
 the liposome disappears somewhere 

00:05:09.789 --> 00:05:16.660
 breaks away or breaks well, as if 

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:19.090
 I do not know the girl that I somehow here for 

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:21.550
 five hundred and more rubles bought 400 with 

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:23.770
 superfluous and somehow I did not really like 

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:27.400
 These were before all sorts of letters and tsiferki 

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:29.200
 Here is such a color as here but apparently 

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:31.570
 from the oil from the fact that I probably 

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:34.900
 she poured a little bit these little letters 

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:37.600
 they have all worn off the nail oil and 

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:39.430
 cuticle in order to maintain in 

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:42.400
 okay cuticle keep okay 

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:46.720
 nails here are very comfortable in principle 

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:49.120
 done here is such a pipette here 

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:52.780
 which is directly attached to the nails 

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:57.070
 dig this butter here I tried it 

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:59.169
 to put or many times even whole ones 

00:05:57.070 --> 00:06:02.260
 month somehow survived so that every day 

00:05:59.169 --> 00:06:05.500
 Well, put the result in principle 

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:06.940
 cuticle moisturized but 

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:09.130
 I would not say that I have somehow 

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:11.860
 her condition has changed a lot 

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:14.590
 she stopped 1 3 

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:18.010
 Well, it's not worth the money to 

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:21.310
 pleasant very pleasant aroma yes there 

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:23.500
 is the oil content of not mistaken then 

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:25.810
 whether avocados so I donâ€™t remember 

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:26.860
 even essentially you are overpaying here 

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:31.590
 purely for the brand 

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:31.590
 but that's all I wanted to say about the copy and
