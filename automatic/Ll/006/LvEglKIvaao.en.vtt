00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 hello to all friends of minutes in this 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:05.490
 new episode that will deal with the fifa 13 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:07.859
 high morning in practice that I will show 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.050
 two teams pausing at the moment 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:12.150
 before starting the video wanted 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:15.120
 remember that tomorrow will begin on 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.740
 huawei contest to give 7,500 credits 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.080
 the winner obviously must be 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.770
 Channel subscribers like 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:21.960
 below the video 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.609
 then we start bombing with the initials of 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.529
 ultimate team after this great 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.960
 victory of the land division 1 online 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:49.610
 more unique event then rare to bomb 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:49.610
 but we are a strong team but none 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:56.250
 screams moore friends here we have the 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.859
 naples as you can see there is the whole 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.710
 complete team with fit blacks 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:05.790
 as the only exception of rare cards 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:08.909
 let's say cavani and the beast of this one 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:11.310
 team with 29 goals in 23 games like 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.560
 we will also see later 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.299
 then as a game of Naples the thing 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.100
 main defense we do from 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.080
 defense is therefore to cover the 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:22.200
 spaces with canevaro and put it in one 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.939
 advantageous position to take the 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.110
 fast attackers then snap 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:27.119
 send in pressing 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.460
 his companions around him 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.930
 especially the CDCs already have part of the 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.570
 sometimes it will happen to send the cdc in 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.670
 pressing when we come with cannavaro 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:39.000
 cannavaro jacopo of spaces in attack 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:41.250
 I concentrate mainly on doing 1 2 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.970
 with cavani 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:47.970
 sorry with hamsik and insigne or 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:52.049
 I go on the bands with short exchanges and 1 2 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:54.299
 with exteriors then dossena and May 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:57.110
 so you don't have to go on 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:02:00.509
 bands for corsair mach 1 2 passages 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:04.680
 specify an important thing about this 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:08.129
 team anyway is to not play 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:11.300
 always staying focused and not going 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:13.570
 inertia in the usual actions and passages 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:16.130
 but what we feel at the moment is more 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:18.050
 player seems more free but 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:20.660
 watch observe all entries 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:22.670
 of the companions above all because seen 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:24.800
 that the agreement is maximum will happen many 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:25.460
 times when holding possession 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.920
 ball 

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:30.830
 many entries will arrive 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:33.800
 sometimes even from the outside to the 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:36.050
 center of the penalty area and therefore the 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:37.670
 we can serve with crosses to make them 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:39.710
 go to sign also shooting text to 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:42.020
 flight especially with May happens to me 

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:46.250
 this thing because it is already very strong in 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:48.590
 these cases therefore now puts in the field 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:51.080
 second team and how you could 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:54.170
 see before it is a team 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:56.480
 a mix of Colombians, however, standard 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:58.700
 a and players of the series with falcao 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:01.010
 the mythical falcao in attack with 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:03.110
 really complete attacker 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:06.230
 start describing as I put it 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:08.150
 all players on the pitch like the 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:10.880
 team to marchetti door Sylvester 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:13.070
 in defense ogbonna right and armero a 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:15.739
 left very fast the minimum defense 

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:18.800
 70 speed with sylvan 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:19.910
 in midfield guarin nainggolan I have 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:21.500
 put in the golan even if it is not 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:22.880
 Colombian because it completes very well 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.700
 with guarin being faster and less 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:27.650
 physical while guarin is very physical and a 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:30.530
 a little slower so one goes a little more 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:33.500
 pressing in to fight 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:35.180
 the opponent and the other goes to recover 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:38.120
 the ransom 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:41.510
 those that are being inserted on 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:43.280
 left zuniga squared right as deeds 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:46.130
 that is, as coc the barbel who 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:48.709
 originally installments like everyone else 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:50.900
 we have the mythical falcao who as you see 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:54.040
 5 stars for debt then pull of 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:55.220
 left and right indifferently e 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:57.230
 muriel 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:59.989
 next to him how do I show a 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:02.330
 moment the comparison between falcao and the 

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:04.880
 great cavani who scored me more goals 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:06.470
 although more scarce because use a little 

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:09.530
 better because I know it very very much 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:13.640
 offline as john this team then 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:15.920
 it goes from bad strength to aim the bottom 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:20.150
 and cross to cross them and a half to 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:22.639
 falcao and in midfield it becomes a 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:24.439
 short phrasing to throw 

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:27.580
 tips to wait for entries 

00:04:24.439 --> 00:04:31.279
 of the tips or to give on the bands 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:33.830
 to the exterior with ibarbo of ideas we know 

00:04:31.279 --> 00:04:36.529
 pull from the distance either shoot or 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:39.379
 try 12 with anyone if close because 

00:04:36.529 --> 00:04:42.740
 it is very fast and very physical while in 

00:04:39.379 --> 00:04:44.659
 defense there are no problems because yes 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:46.639
 both all players are fast and 

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:48.289
 very good the only problem could 

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:50.979
 be that of armero when he goes to 

00:04:48.289 --> 00:04:53.689
 detach the head on a set piece or 

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:54.460
 however on cross coming from 

00:04:53.689 --> 00:04:57.379
 opposite band 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:58.490
 now more or less this is all it is 

00:04:57.379 --> 00:05:01.699
 Use these two teams' tactics 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:03.919
 then one more passages and one tactic 

00:05:01.699 --> 00:05:07.639
 this is more reasoned than brute power e 

00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:09.439
 speed to pierce the cyber defenses here 

00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:11.719
 which reminds you that tomorrow we will do together 

00:05:09.439 --> 00:05:14.270
 give away contests for the 7,500 credits 

00:05:11.719 --> 00:05:15.740
 so the fifa ultimate team must 

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:17.120
 be registered to participate in 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:19.039
 contest 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:21.110
 I have to like the video 

00:05:19.039 --> 00:05:21.949
 however, I will tell you everything in detail 

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:23.779
 next time 

00:05:21.949 --> 00:05:25.339
