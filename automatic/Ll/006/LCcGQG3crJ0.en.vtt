that<00:01:44.009> works<00:01:44.729> pretty<00:01:45.000> well

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:53.880 

the<00:01:51.189> real<00:01:51.759> problem<00:01:52.450> with<00:01:52.630> the<00:01:52.780> DSi<00:01:53.170> browser<00:01:53.439> is

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:53.890 
the real problem with the DSi browser is

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:56.190 
the real problem with the DSi browser is
not<00:01:54.490> only<00:01:54.700> does<00:01:55.030> it<00:01:55.270> take<00:01:55.479> up<00:01:55.659> quite<00:01:55.900> a<00:01:55.930> bit<00:01:56.110> of

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:56.200 
not only does it take up quite a bit of

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.620 
not only does it take up quite a bit of
space<00:01:56.439> it<00:01:56.830> takes<00:01:57.490> a<00:01:57.729> while<00:01:57.970> for<00:01:58.000> things<00:01:58.509> to

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:58.630 
space it takes a while for things to

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:00.930 
space it takes a while for things to
load<00:01:58.720> particularly<00:01:59.680> if<00:01:59.860> you<00:02:00.009> want<00:02:00.280> images<00:02:00.670> to

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:00.940 
load particularly if you want images to

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:02.880 
load particularly if you want images to
load<00:02:01.119> you<00:02:01.690> can<00:02:01.840> actually<00:02:02.020> turn<00:02:02.470> off<00:02:02.530> that

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:02.890 
load you can actually turn off that

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:06.230 
load you can actually turn off that
setting<00:02:03.340> and<00:02:03.750> make<00:02:04.750> loading<00:02:05.020> times<00:02:05.380> faster

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
setting and make loading times faster

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:11.840 
setting and make loading times faster
but<00:02:07.240> then<00:02:08.170> it's<00:02:08.459> you're<00:02:09.459> pretty<00:02:09.789> limited

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:11.850 
but then it's you're pretty limited

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:17.280 
but then it's you're pretty limited

the rating recognition sometimes is not

00:02:48.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
the rating recognition sometimes is not
the<00:02:48.910> best<00:02:57.180> and<00:02:58.739> then<00:02:59.739> just<00:03:00.000> press<00:03:01.000> ok<00:03:01.420> and

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:05.699 
the best and then just press ok and
let's<00:03:02.350> search<00:03:02.620> it<00:03:03.090> and<00:03:04.170> let's<00:03:05.170> see<00:03:05.350> what<00:03:05.500> comes

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:05.709 
let's search it and let's see what comes

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:08.819 
let's search it and let's see what comes
up<00:03:06.180> most<00:03:07.180> websites<00:03:07.570> work<00:03:08.079> pretty<00:03:08.380> well<00:03:08.500> on

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:08.829 
up most websites work pretty well on

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:12.470 
up most websites work pretty well on
this<00:03:09.040> but<00:03:09.760> there<00:03:10.060> are<00:03:10.180> a<00:03:10.239> few<00:03:10.269> that<00:03:10.630> don't<00:03:11.019> and

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
this but there are a few that don't and

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.740 
this but there are a few that don't and
well<00:03:13.480> in<00:03:14.160> technically<00:03:15.160> all<00:03:15.430> websites<00:03:16.150> do<00:03:16.480> work

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:16.750 
well in technically all websites do work

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:20.069 
well in technically all websites do work
but<00:03:17.530> some<00:03:17.829> of<00:03:17.950> them<00:03:18.100> are<00:03:18.280> kind<00:03:18.850> of<00:03:18.940> useless<00:03:19.299> for

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:20.079 
but some of them are kind of useless for

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:22.770 
but some of them are kind of useless for
example<00:03:20.530> YouTube<00:03:21.040> works<00:03:21.549> but<00:03:22.390> there's<00:03:22.570> no

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:22.780 
example YouTube works but there's no

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:24.870 
example YouTube works but there's no
Flash<00:03:23.170> Player<00:03:23.560> so<00:03:23.859> you<00:03:23.950> can<00:03:24.160> actually<00:03:24.400> watch

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:24.880 
Flash Player so you can actually watch

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:28.530 
Flash Player so you can actually watch
videos<00:03:25.450> or<00:03:25.690> anything<00:03:26.940> it's<00:03:27.940> really<00:03:28.180> ashamed

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540 
videos or anything it's really ashamed

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.780 
videos or anything it's really ashamed
that<00:03:28.660> there<00:03:28.930> is<00:03:29.049> no<00:03:29.320> Flash<00:03:29.620> Player<00:03:29.920> and<00:03:29.980> trust

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790 
that there is no Flash Player and trust

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:31.440 
that there is no Flash Player and trust
me<00:03:31.000> I've<00:03:31.120> tried

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:31.450 
me I've tried

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:33.630 
me I've tried
there's<00:03:32.079> no<00:03:32.230> way<00:03:32.350> to<00:03:32.410> download<00:03:32.709> it<00:03:33.100> either

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:33.640 
there's no way to download it either

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:35.699 
there's no way to download it either
it'll<00:03:34.060> be<00:03:34.180> really<00:03:34.390> nice<00:03:34.690> if<00:03:34.959> in<00:03:35.140> the<00:03:35.230> DSi<00:03:35.680> shop

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:35.709 
it'll be really nice if in the DSi shop

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:37.380 
it'll be really nice if in the DSi shop
they<00:03:36.190> actually<00:03:36.579> made<00:03:36.760> a<00:03:36.790> Flash<00:03:37.090> Player

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:37.390 
they actually made a Flash Player

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:45.509 
they actually made a Flash Player
available<00:03:42.480> and<00:03:43.769> there's<00:03:44.769> really<00:03:45.220> not<00:03:45.459> too

00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:45.519 
available and there's really not too

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:48.690 
available and there's really not too
much<00:03:45.730> to<00:03:45.910> say<00:03:46.120> if<00:03:46.709> if<00:03:47.709> you<00:03:48.010> think<00:03:48.340> this<00:03:48.519> might

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:48.700 
much to say if if you think this might

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:53.009 
much to say if if you think this might
be<00:03:48.760> useful<00:03:49.239> and<00:03:50.280> if<00:03:51.280> for<00:03:51.970> example<00:03:52.030> let's<00:03:52.810> say

00:03:53.009 --> 00:03:53.019 
be useful and if for example let's say

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:54.920 
be useful and if for example let's say
you<00:03:53.079> have<00:03:53.260> a<00:03:53.380> you<00:03:54.100> have<00:03:54.160> to<00:03:54.370> share<00:03:54.609> a<00:03:54.640> computer

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
you have a you have to share a computer

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:59.729 
you have a you have to share a computer
with<00:03:55.930> other<00:03:56.290> people<00:03:57.630> and<00:03:58.630> you<00:03:58.959> have<00:03:59.199> a<00:03:59.229> Wi-Fi

00:03:59.729 --> 00:03:59.739 
with other people and you have a Wi-Fi

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:01.890 
with other people and you have a Wi-Fi
network<00:03:59.769> then<00:04:00.669> this<00:04:00.850> is<00:04:01.000> praveen<00:04:01.510> this<00:04:01.660> might

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:01.900 
network then this is praveen this might

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:03.540 
network then this is praveen this might
be<00:04:02.079> worth<00:04:02.320> it<00:04:02.560> for<00:04:02.769> you

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:03.550 
be worth it for you

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:04.920 
be worth it for you
but<00:04:03.730> you<00:04:04.060> know<00:04:04.150> if<00:04:04.300> you<00:04:04.420> have<00:04:04.600> your<00:04:04.780> own

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:04.930 
but you know if you have your own

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:07.620 
but you know if you have your own
computer<00:04:05.170> or<00:04:05.500> something<00:04:06.100> then<00:04:06.910> there's

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:07.630 
computer or something then there's

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:09.150 
computer or something then there's
really<00:04:07.870> not<00:04:08.110> too<00:04:08.170> much<00:04:08.380> of<00:04:08.680> a<00:04:08.770> point<00:04:09.040> of

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:09.160 
really not too much of a point of

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:10.860 
really not too much of a point of
getting<00:04:09.550> this<00:04:09.850> since<00:04:10.090> it<00:04:10.240> eats<00:04:10.420> up<00:04:10.570> quite<00:04:10.840> a

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:10.870 
getting this since it eats up quite a

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:13.260 
getting this since it eats up quite a
bit<00:04:11.050> of<00:04:11.170> space<00:04:11.440> if<00:04:12.160> I<00:04:12.280> remember<00:04:12.730> correctly<00:04:13.120> it

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:13.270 
bit of space if I remember correctly it

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:17.699 
bit of space if I remember correctly it
was<00:04:13.330> 96<00:04:14.020> blocks<00:04:14.470> and<00:04:15.600> other<00:04:16.709> applications

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:17.709 
was 96 blocks and other applications

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:21.030 
was 96 blocks and other applications
even<00:04:17.980> like<00:04:18.340> the<00:04:18.549> bigger<00:04:18.790> ones<00:04:19.350> aren't<00:04:20.350> even

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:21.040 
even like the bigger ones aren't even

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:28.320 
even like the bigger ones aren't even
close<00:04:21.220> to<00:04:21.519> that<00:04:26.070> so<00:04:27.070> in<00:04:27.130> all<00:04:27.250> honesty<00:04:27.460> just<00:04:28.090> get

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:28.330 
close to that so in all honesty just get

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:33.490 
card and space is not an issue then you

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:36.810
