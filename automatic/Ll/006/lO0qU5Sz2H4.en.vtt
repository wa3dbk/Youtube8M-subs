00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:13.300 
bearing block on that clutch now to

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:16.230 
bearing block on that clutch now to
install<00:01:13.690> the<00:01:14.110> opinion<00:01:14.759> this<00:01:15.759> pinion<00:01:15.970> just

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:16.240 
install the opinion this pinion just

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.300 
install the opinion this pinion just
drops<00:01:16.420> on<00:01:16.570> top<00:01:16.750> of<00:01:16.780> there<00:01:17.050> make<00:01:17.950> sure<00:01:18.130> that

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:18.310 
drops on top of there make sure that

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:19.980 
drops on top of there make sure that
seed<00:01:18.580> it<00:01:18.759> all<00:01:18.850> the<00:01:18.970> way<00:01:19.060> down<00:01:19.090> because<00:01:19.720> the

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:19.990 
seed it all the way down because the

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:21.570 
seed it all the way down because the
pinion<00:01:20.289> actually<00:01:20.649> clamps<00:01:21.070> on<00:01:21.190> the<00:01:21.250> inner<00:01:21.369> race

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:21.580 
pinion actually clamps on the inner race

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:25.320 
pinion actually clamps on the inner race
of<00:01:21.850> this<00:01:21.970> bearing<00:01:22.770> now<00:01:23.770> we<00:01:24.340> can<00:01:24.580> install<00:01:24.909> the

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:25.330 
of this bearing now we can install the

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:28.950 
of this bearing now we can install the
bolt<00:01:26.080> that<00:01:26.200> holds<00:01:26.259> opinion<00:01:26.830> to<00:01:27.460> the<00:01:27.550> clutch<00:01:27.960> so

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:28.960 
bolt that holds opinion to the clutch so

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:30.630 
bolt that holds opinion to the clutch so
that<00:01:29.079> goes<00:01:29.290> through<00:01:29.560> the<00:01:29.649> hole<00:01:29.829> inside<00:01:30.399> the

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:30.640 
that goes through the hole inside the

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:43.100 
that goes through the hole inside the
clutch<00:01:31.270> belt<00:01:31.680> and<00:01:33.210> wipe<00:01:34.210> that<00:01:34.420> down

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:49.820 

okay<00:01:44.930> so<00:01:45.930> that's<00:01:46.110> held<00:01:46.800> in<00:01:46.890> place<00:01:47.160> there<00:01:48.800> the

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:49.830 
okay so that's held in place there the

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:53.600 
okay so that's held in place there the
top<00:01:50.130> bearing<00:01:50.690> bearing<00:01:51.690> block<00:01:51.990> actually<00:01:52.860> that

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
top bearing bearing block actually that

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.910 
top bearing bearing block actually that
goes<00:01:53.820> on<00:01:54.000> a<00:01:54.030> specific<00:01:54.270> way<00:01:54.630> as<00:01:54.780> well<00:01:54.960> so<00:01:55.770> what

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
goes on a specific way as well so what

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.290 
goes on a specific way as well so what
we<00:01:56.010> need<00:01:56.160> to<00:01:56.190> do<00:01:56.400> is<00:01:56.550> make<00:01:56.730> sure<00:01:56.760> the<00:01:57.030> flush

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:57.300 
we need to do is make sure the flush

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:00.070 
we need to do is make sure the flush
face<00:01:57.690> of<00:01:58.050> this<00:01:58.200> bearing<00:01:58.560> block<00:01:58.770> goes<00:01:59.310> down

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:00.080 
face of this bearing block goes down

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:05.300 
face of this bearing block goes down
onto<00:02:01.080> the<00:02:01.170> pinion<00:02:03.500> okay<00:02:04.500> so<00:02:04.830> that<00:02:04.950> completes

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
onto the pinion okay so that completes

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:19.200 
onto the pinion okay so that completes
the<00:02:05.580> clutch<00:02:06.090> stack<00:02:06.360> and<00:02:06.860> pinion<00:02:07.860> assembly

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:19.210 

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:23.170 

now<00:02:20.210> we're<00:02:20.450> going<00:02:20.630> to<00:02:21.310> assemble<00:02:22.310> the<00:02:22.550> base

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
now we're going to assemble the base

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.050 
now we're going to assemble the base
plate<00:02:23.600> to<00:02:23.870> the<00:02:24.290> skids<00:02:24.650> and<00:02:24.920> I'm<00:02:25.760> just<00:02:25.880> going<00:02:26.000> to

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
plate to the skids and I'm just going to

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.500 
plate to the skids and I'm just going to
talk<00:02:26.209> about<00:02:26.330> orientation<00:02:27.110> so<00:02:28.010> I<00:02:28.459> like<00:02:29.240> to<00:02:29.270> put

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 
talk about orientation so I like to put

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:33.309 
talk about orientation so I like to put
my<00:02:29.690> skids<00:02:31.150> sort<00:02:32.150> of<00:02:32.240> facing<00:02:32.480> backwards<00:02:33.110> this

00:02:33.309 --> 00:02:33.319 
my skids sort of facing backwards this

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:34.990 
my skids sort of facing backwards this
is<00:02:33.380> the<00:02:33.620> front<00:02:33.860> of<00:02:33.950> the<00:02:34.010> helicopter<00:02:34.160> of<00:02:34.730> skids

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
is the front of the helicopter of skids

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.270 
is the front of the helicopter of skids
here<00:02:35.270> I<00:02:35.450> like<00:02:36.020> them<00:02:36.170> to<00:02:36.290> angle<00:02:36.620> backwards<00:02:37.130> it

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
here I like them to angle backwards it

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.340 
here I like them to angle backwards it
gives<00:02:37.459> me<00:02:37.580> better<00:02:37.790> balance<00:02:38.209> with<00:02:38.870> the<00:02:38.990> gasser

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:39.350 
gives me better balance with the gasser

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:42.490 
gives me better balance with the gasser
I<00:02:39.380> think<00:02:39.740> it<00:02:39.830> looks<00:02:39.950> better<00:02:40.130> so<00:02:41.290> this<00:02:42.290> base

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
I think it looks better so this base

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.300 
I think it looks better so this base
plate<00:02:44.590> there's<00:02:45.590> a<00:02:45.650> little<00:02:45.890> cutout<00:02:46.070> on<00:02:46.220> the

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:02.300 
other side so make sure you get it the

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:04.270 
other side so make sure you get it the
right<00:03:02.450> way<00:03:02.600> you<00:03:02.900> can<00:03:03.410> have<00:03:03.680> it<00:03:03.800> that<00:03:03.950> way<00:03:04.100> but

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280 
right way you can have it that way but

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:07.810 
right way you can have it that way but
that<00:03:04.310> won't<00:03:04.519> work<00:03:05.200> okay<00:03:06.200> so<00:03:06.410> what<00:03:07.340> we<00:03:07.430> do<00:03:07.640> now

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:07.820 
that won't work okay so what we do now

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:10.740 
that won't work okay so what we do now
is<00:03:08.060> we'll<00:03:08.209> install<00:03:08.739> these<00:03:09.739> frame<00:03:10.070> blocks

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750 
is we'll install these frame blocks

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:13.710 
is we'll install these frame blocks
through<00:03:11.750> the<00:03:12.050> plate<00:03:12.320> through<00:03:12.830> do<00:03:12.980> the<00:03:13.100> skids

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 
through the plate through do the skids

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:19.979 
through the plate through do the skids
and<00:03:14.720> then<00:03:15.260> we'll<00:03:15.709> move<00:03:15.830> on<00:03:16.010> to<00:03:16.040> our<00:03:16.220> next<00:03:16.370> step

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:19.989 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:22.210 

now<00:03:20.989> that<00:03:21.019> we've<00:03:21.230> got<00:03:21.350> that<00:03:21.500> done<00:03:21.769> we're<00:03:22.040> going

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.220 
now that we've got that done we're going

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:24.250 
now that we've got that done we're going
to<00:03:22.370> install<00:03:23.090> the<00:03:23.329> motor<00:03:23.540> onto<00:03:23.900> this<00:03:24.019> base

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:24.260 
to install the motor onto this base

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:30.539 
to install the motor onto this base
plate<00:03:24.610> so<00:03:25.610> to<00:03:26.060> do<00:03:26.239> that<00:03:27.880> your<00:03:28.880> motor<00:03:29.090> and

00:03:30.539 --> 00:03:30.549 
plate so to do that your motor and

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:39.120 
plate so to do that your motor and
you'll<00:03:31.549> need<00:03:31.820> to<00:03:32.000> remove<00:03:34.930> the<00:03:35.930> four<00:03:36.850> and<00:03:37.850> five

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:39.130 
you'll need to remove the four and five

00:03:39.130 --> 00:04:01.360 
you'll need to remove the four and five
cap<00:03:40.130> bolts<00:03:40.459> so<00:03:40.880> we'll<00:03:41.239> go<00:03:41.360> ahead<00:03:41.390> and<00:03:41.600> do<00:03:41.720> that

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:01.370 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:03.080 

the<00:04:02.370> other<00:04:02.519> thing<00:04:02.670> you<00:04:02.730> might<00:04:02.849> want<00:04:03.060> to

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
the other thing you might want to

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:04.520 
the other thing you might want to
consider<00:04:03.329> doing<00:04:03.450> now<00:04:03.780> as<00:04:04.019> well<00:04:04.200> if<00:04:04.379> you're

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530 
consider doing now as well if you're

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:06.619

going<00:04:04.680> to<00:04:04.739> be<00:04:04.799> using<00:04:05.099> a<00:04:05.159> static<00:04:05.400> Gator<00:04:05.670> is<00:04:06.329> to

00:04:06.619 --> 00:04:06.629 
going to be using a static Gator is to

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:09.530 
going to be using a static Gator is to
remove<00:04:06.930> your<00:04:07.769> kill<00:04:08.010> switch<00:04:08.280> and<00:04:08.489> install<00:04:09.450> the

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540 
remove your kill switch and install the

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:11.660 
remove your kill switch and install the
starter<00:04:09.750> Gator<00:04:10.049> and<00:04:10.260> position<00:04:11.250> it<00:04:11.340> in<00:04:11.400> place

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:11.670 
starter Gator and position it in place

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:13.629 
starter Gator and position it in place
now<00:04:11.700> because<00:04:12.209> it<00:04:12.329> make<00:04:12.450> it<00:04:12.540> a<00:04:12.629> lot<00:04:12.810> easier<00:04:13.200> so

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:13.639 
now because it make it a lot easier so

00:04:13.639 --> 00:04:17.479 
now because it make it a lot easier so
with<00:04:14.639> all<00:04:14.730> those<00:04:14.849> removed<00:04:15.829> and<00:04:16.829> a<00:04:16.949> funk<00:04:17.280> it<00:04:17.400> on

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:17.489 
with all those removed and a funk it on

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:19.390 
with all those removed and a funk it on

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:19.400 
top

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:22.670 
top
okay<00:04:20.400> so<00:04:21.090> sparkplug<00:04:21.660> if<00:04:21.810> it<00:04:21.930> goes<00:04:22.259> towards<00:04:22.650> the

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:22.680 
okay so sparkplug if it goes towards the

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:47.000 
okay so sparkplug if it goes towards the
front

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:47.010 

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:49.500 

that's<00:04:48.010> it<00:04:48.220> now<00:04:48.760> you're<00:04:48.880> ready<00:04:49.060> for<00:04:49.210> the<00:04:49.330> next

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:49.510 
that's it now you're ready for the next

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:51.720 
that's it now you're ready for the next
