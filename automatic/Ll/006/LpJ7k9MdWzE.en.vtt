years remember seeing this in theaters
in<00:00:23.060> 1997<00:00:24.060> so<00:00:24.449> it's<00:00:24.960> crazy<00:00:25.590> how<00:00:25.830> fast<00:00:25.859> time

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
great the colors look a little dull

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.930

faded<00:00:36.710> Audio<00:00:37.710> is<00:00:37.860> pretty<00:00:38.100> solid<00:00:38.340> though<00:00:38.670> it's

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
faded Audio is pretty solid though it's

a four and a half out of a five for the

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
audio but we're definitely not gonna see

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.650

any<00:00:43.200> remastering<00:00:44.100> for<00:00:44.969> this<00:00:45.090> film<00:00:45.390> and

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
any remastering for this film and

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.170 
any remastering for this film and
anytime<00:00:46.260> soon<00:00:46.590> or<00:00:46.800> ever<00:00:47.070> I<00:00:47.340> don't<00:00:47.550> think<00:00:47.760> but

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
anytime soon or ever I don't think but

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.240 
anytime soon or ever I don't think but
if<00:00:48.750> you<00:00:48.899> have<00:00:49.020> the<00:00:49.140> old<00:00:49.350> DVD<00:00:49.800> this<00:00:49.980> one<00:00:50.160> right

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
if you have the old DVD this one right

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.350 
if you have the old DVD this one right
here<00:00:50.489> you<00:00:50.640> definitely<00:00:50.789> should<00:00:51.180> upgrade

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
here you definitely should upgrade

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.270 
here you definitely should upgrade
because<00:00:51.690> it<00:00:51.989> is<00:00:52.110> widescreen<00:00:52.559> but<00:00:52.980> it's<00:00:53.100> not

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
because it is widescreen but it's not

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.729 
because it is widescreen but it's not
anamorphic<00:00:54.000> widescreen<00:00:54.059> so<00:00:54.930> just<00:00:55.440> for<00:00:55.620> that

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
anamorphic widescreen so just for that

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.380 
anamorphic widescreen so just for that
reason<00:00:55.770> alone<00:00:56.100> you<00:00:56.579> definitely<00:00:56.969> should<00:00:57.180> pick

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
reason alone you definitely should pick

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.990 
reason alone you definitely should pick
this<00:00:57.570> from<00:00:57.780> up<00:00:57.960> I<00:00:58.260> got<00:00:58.649> this<00:00:58.829> for<00:00:59.219> around<00:00:59.370> $10

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
this from up I got this for around $10

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.049 
this from up I got this for around $10
so<00:01:00.270> I<00:01:00.329> thought<00:01:00.510> it<00:01:00.570> was<00:01:00.660> a<00:01:00.690> good<00:01:00.930> deal<00:01:01.109> but

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:02.059 
so I thought it was a good deal but

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:04.340 
so I thought it was a good deal but
anything<00:01:03.059> let<00:01:03.270> and<00:01:03.510> anything<00:01:04.019> more<00:01:04.199> than

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
anything let and anything more than

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.350 
anything let and anything more than
that's<00:01:04.530> not<00:01:04.799> worth<00:01:05.010> it<00:01:05.159> I<00:01:05.280> would<00:01:05.400> hold<00:01:05.580> off<00:01:05.760> but

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
that's not worth it I would hold off but

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:07.550 
that's not worth it I would hold off but
if<00:01:06.450> you<00:01:06.540> can<00:01:06.659> get<00:01:06.810> it<00:01:06.930> around<00:01:07.020> 10<00:01:07.350> bucks

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
if you can get it around 10 bucks

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.800 
if you can get it around 10 bucks
definitely<00:01:08.010> do<00:01:08.159> so<00:01:08.340> as<00:01:08.820> far<00:01:09.060> as<00:01:09.119> features<00:01:09.600> it's

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
definitely do so as far as features it's

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.200 
definitely do so as far as features it's
very<00:01:10.020> minimal<00:01:10.320> features<00:01:11.040> you<00:01:11.520> get<00:01:11.700> a<00:01:11.729> couple

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
very minimal features you get a couple

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.480 
very minimal features you get a couple
production<00:01:12.750> featurettes<00:01:13.290> which<00:01:14.220> they're

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
production featurettes which they're

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.700 
production featurettes which they're
relatively<00:01:15.000> short<00:01:15.390> and<00:01:15.659> you<00:01:16.290> also<00:01:16.409> get

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
relatively short and you also get

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.499 
relatively short and you also get
theatrical<00:01:17.580> trailer<00:01:18.000> and<00:01:18.150> that's<00:01:18.210> pretty

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
theatrical trailer and that's pretty

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:19.370 
theatrical trailer and that's pretty
much<00:01:18.689> it

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
much it

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.350 
much it
let's<00:01:19.950> take<00:01:20.130> a<00:01:20.159> look<00:01:20.369> inside<00:01:20.549> just<00:01:20.759> a<00:01:21.119> plain

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
let's take a look inside just a plain

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.179 
let's take a look inside just a plain
old<00:01:21.390> disc<00:01:22.140> I<00:01:22.170> don't<00:01:22.799> could<00:01:22.979> have<00:01:23.070> been

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
old disc I don't could have been

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.010 
old disc I don't could have been
slightly<00:01:23.490> bigger<00:01:23.909> right<00:01:24.150> here<00:01:24.390> but<00:01:24.780> it<00:01:24.900> is

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
slightly bigger right here but it is

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.530 
slightly bigger right here but it is
what<00:01:25.049> it<00:01:25.350> is<00:01:25.500> I<00:01:25.680> mean<00:01:25.830> that's<00:01:26.159> what<00:01:26.369> usually

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:26.540 
what it is I mean that's what usually

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:29.210 
what it is I mean that's what usually
touchstone<00:01:27.540> Disney<00:01:27.960> do<00:01:28.110> what<00:01:28.320> their<00:01:28.500> releases

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
touchstone Disney do what their releases

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.170 
touchstone Disney do what their releases
on<00:01:29.579> blu-ray<00:01:29.909> but<00:01:30.890> overall<00:01:31.890> I<00:01:32.310> think<00:01:32.850> a<00:01:32.939> lot<00:01:33.150> of

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
on blu-ray but overall I think a lot of

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.240 
on blu-ray but overall I think a lot of
people<00:01:33.630> definitely<00:01:34.409> enjoy<00:01:34.650> this<00:01:34.770> film<00:01:34.950> if<00:01:35.130> you

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
people definitely enjoy this film if you

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.460 
people definitely enjoy this film if you
