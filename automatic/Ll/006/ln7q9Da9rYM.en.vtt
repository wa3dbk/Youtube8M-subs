picked<00:03:20.060> up<00:03:20.150> a<00:03:20.240> silence<00:03:20.690> there<00:03:21.070> I'm<00:03:22.070> prefer

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:22.610 
picked up a silence there I'm prefer

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:25.960 
picked up a silence there I'm prefer
yeah<00:03:22.820> that's<00:03:23.060> pretty<00:03:23.209> interesting<00:03:24.850> okay<00:03:25.850> so

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970 
yeah that's pretty interesting okay so

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:27.400 
yeah that's pretty interesting okay so
two<00:03:26.030> points<00:03:26.420> and<00:03:26.540> to<00:03:26.630> frost<00:03:26.900> arrow<00:03:27.140> so<00:03:27.320> it

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:27.410 
two points and to frost arrow so it

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:28.180 
two points and to frost arrow so it
looks<00:03:27.560> like<00:03:27.650> they're<00:03:27.890> playing<00:03:28.130> very

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:28.190 
looks like they're playing very

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:30.790 
looks like they're playing very
aggressively<00:03:29.150> and<00:03:30.140> as<00:03:30.290> they<00:03:30.440> said<00:03:30.650> I'm<00:03:30.770> sure

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:30.800 
aggressively and as they said I'm sure

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:32.290 
aggressively and as they said I'm sure
why<00:03:31.040> they<00:03:31.190> haven't<00:03:31.370> gotten<00:03:31.670> that<00:03:31.790> true<00:03:32.090> shot

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:32.300 
why they haven't gotten that true shot

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:34.990 
why they haven't gotten that true shot
or<00:03:32.420> I'll<00:03:32.570> yet<00:03:32.750> it<00:03:32.930> does<00:03:33.140> my<00:03:34.130> exciting<00:03:34.550> terms<00:03:34.850> of

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:35.000 
or I'll yet it does my exciting terms of

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.910 
or I'll yet it does my exciting terms of
last<00:03:35.209> hitting<00:03:35.480> however<00:03:36.170> I<00:03:36.200> guess<00:03:36.350> she<00:03:36.740> does

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:36.920 
last hitting however I guess she does

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:38.800 
last hitting however I guess she does
want<00:03:37.130> a<00:03:37.280> bit<00:03:37.490> more<00:03:37.610> HP<00:03:37.850> just<00:03:38.420> to<00:03:38.660> make<00:03:38.780> sure

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:38.810 
want a bit more HP just to make sure

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:40.600 
want a bit more HP just to make sure
that<00:03:39.530> she<00:03:39.650> doesn't<00:03:39.800> get<00:03:39.980> picked<00:03:40.160> off<00:03:40.310> from<00:03:40.490> the

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:40.610 
that she doesn't get picked off from the

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:42.280 
that she doesn't get picked off from the
earth<00:03:40.730> shakers<00:03:41.180> Fisher<00:03:41.570> that<00:03:41.690> every<00:03:41.930> last<00:03:42.050> bit

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:42.290 
earth shakers Fisher that every last bit

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:47.020 
earth shakers Fisher that every last bit
helps<00:03:44.230> yeah<00:03:45.230> just<00:03:45.830> like<00:03:46.010> I<00:03:46.070> guess<00:03:46.490> a<00:03:46.520> guess<00:03:46.850> of

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:47.030 
helps yeah just like I guess a guess of

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:48.280 
helps yeah just like I guess a guess of
why<00:03:47.209> they're<00:03:47.450> not<00:03:47.480> actually<00:03:47.870> picking<00:03:48.230> up

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:48.290 
why they're not actually picking up

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:49.840 
why they're not actually picking up
Trish<00:03:48.500> ahora<00:03:48.620> here<00:03:49.010> is<00:03:49.370> that<00:03:49.490> maybe<00:03:49.670> he

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:49.850 
Trish ahora here is that maybe he

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:51.280 
Trish ahora here is that maybe he
doesn't<00:03:50.000> want<00:03:50.120> the<00:03:50.330> range<00:03:50.510> creep<00:03:50.840> of<00:03:51.050> him

doesn't want the range creep of him

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:53.260 
doesn't want the range creep of him
strange<00:03:52.250> trip<00:03:52.430> to<00:03:52.550> push<00:03:52.820> that<00:03:52.970> much<00:03:53.120> they
