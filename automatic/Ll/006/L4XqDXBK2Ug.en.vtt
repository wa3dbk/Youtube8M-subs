00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:16.580 
playing well actually we try to make it

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:19.779 
playing well actually we try to make it
here<00:01:16.909> first<00:01:17.510> really<00:01:18.290> clean<00:01:18.590> background<00:01:18.950> big

00:01:19.779 --> 00:01:19.789 
here first really clean background big

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:22.179 
here first really clean background big
canvas<00:01:20.479> really<00:01:20.899> refined<00:01:21.380> sir<00:01:21.679> it's<00:01:21.920> really

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:22.189 
canvas really refined sir it's really

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:24.550 
canvas really refined sir it's really
logical<00:01:22.549> surface<00:01:23.149> as<00:01:23.659> much<00:01:23.929> as<00:01:24.079> we<00:01:24.259> did<00:01:24.380> for

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:24.560 
logical surface as much as we did for

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:25.870 
logical surface as much as we did for
the<00:01:24.710> exterior<00:01:25.039> we<00:01:25.399> spend<00:01:25.640> a<00:01:25.729> lot<00:01:25.759> of

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:25.880 
the exterior we spend a lot of

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.230 
the exterior we spend a lot of
management<00:01:26.770> refining<00:01:27.770> interior<00:01:28.520> volume<00:01:28.880> and

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.240 
management refining interior volume and

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.060 
management refining interior volume and
surface<00:01:29.390> and<00:01:29.840> then<00:01:30.140> we<00:01:30.289> are<00:01:30.380> thinking<00:01:30.710> to<00:01:30.859> how

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:31.070 
surface and then we are thinking to how

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.639 
surface and then we are thinking to how
to<00:01:31.130> make<00:01:31.460> it<00:01:31.609> really<00:01:31.909> cool<00:01:32.409> element<00:01:33.409> you<00:01:33.530> know

00:01:33.639 --> 00:01:33.649 
to make it really cool element you know

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:37.810 
to make it really cool element you know
air<00:01:34.280> ventilation<00:01:34.700> and<00:01:35.890> the<00:01:36.890> closed<00:01:37.159> area<00:01:37.460> and

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:37.820 
air ventilation and the closed area and

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:39.459 
air ventilation and the closed area and
driver<00:01:38.030> unit<00:01:38.450> how<00:01:38.600> we<00:01:38.659> can<00:01:38.929> make<00:01:39.079> it<00:01:39.229> really

00:01:39.459 --> 00:01:39.469 
driver unit how we can make it really

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:42.429 
driver unit how we can make it really
clear<00:01:39.710> and<00:01:40.240> drive<00:01:41.240> warranted<00:01:41.749> for<00:01:41.960> you<00:01:42.109> the

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:42.439 
clear and drive warranted for you the

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:44.450 
clear and drive warranted for you the
driver<00:01:42.710> disk<00:01:43.429> all

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
driver disk all

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.780 
driver disk all
and<00:01:44.960> also<00:01:45.960> we<00:01:46.200> found<00:01:46.229> it<00:01:46.650> is<00:01:46.920> the<00:01:47.250> transplant

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
and also we found it is the transplant

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.050 
and also we found it is the transplant
cluster<00:01:48.570> display<00:01:48.799> actually<00:01:49.799> this<00:01:50.070> technology

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
cluster display actually this technology

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.640 
cluster display actually this technology
is<00:01:51.119> invented<00:01:51.510> for<00:01:51.659> the<00:01:51.810> mobile<00:01:52.320> phone

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:52.650 
is invented for the mobile phone

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:55.040 
is invented for the mobile phone
technology<00:01:52.940> actually<00:01:53.940> it's<00:01:54.090> not<00:01:54.240> it's<00:01:54.960> not

calling<00:01:55.590> the<00:01:55.680> street<00:01:55.920> at<00:01:56.100> all<00:01:57.050> but<00:01:58.050> we<00:01:58.619> found

00:01:58.790 --> 00:01:58.800 
calling the street at all but we found

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:02.930 
calling the street at all but we found
it<00:01:59.780> this<00:02:00.780> is<00:02:00.960> really<00:02:01.140> cool<00:02:01.979> potential<00:02:02.640> for<00:02:02.790> the

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:02.940 
it this is really cool potential for the

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:04.820 
it this is really cool potential for the
future<00:02:03.180> technology<00:02:03.960> for<00:02:04.080> the<00:02:04.140> car<00:02:04.320> instrument

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:04.830

panel<00:02:05.190> so<00:02:05.850> we<00:02:06.030> asked<00:02:06.180> them<00:02:06.479> to<00:02:06.690> build<00:02:07.110> it<00:02:07.290> for

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
panel so we asked them to build it for

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.370 
panel so we asked them to build it for
us<00:02:08.160> but<00:02:08.610> first<00:02:09.090> is<00:02:09.330> really<00:02:09.630> it's<00:02:09.780> not<00:02:09.959> easy<00:02:10.350> you

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:10.380 
us but first is really it's not easy you

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:13.040 
us but first is really it's not easy you
know<00:02:10.560> we<00:02:10.709> have<00:02:10.860> to<00:02:11.100> we<00:02:11.970> have<00:02:12.000> to<00:02:12.209> push<00:02:12.540> them<00:02:12.750> to

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
know we have to we have to push them to

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.699 
know we have to we have to push them to
make<00:02:13.620> a<00:02:13.650> proper<00:02:14.300> size<00:02:15.300> of<00:02:15.480> the<00:02:15.660> Beijing<00:02:16.500> the
