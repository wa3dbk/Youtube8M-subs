as much as you do now what difference do

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
you think that would have on your gang

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.700 
you think that would have on your gang
and<00:00:18.090> even<00:00:18.930> more<00:00:18.960> so<00:00:19.410> on<00:00:19.560> your<00:00:20.039> results<00:00:21.650> okay<00:00:22.650> so

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
and even more so on your results okay so

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.499 
and even more so on your results okay so
let's<00:00:23.400> start<00:00:23.640> off<00:00:23.820> by<00:00:23.970> looking<00:00:23.999> at<00:00:24.359> the

00:00:24.499 --> 00:00:24.509 
let's start off by looking at the

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:27.169 
let's start off by looking at the
traditional<00:00:25.109> way<00:00:25.140> of<00:00:25.499> looking<00:00:25.890> at<00:00:25.949> tennis<00:00:26.310> now

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:27.179 
traditional way of looking at tennis now

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:28.729 
traditional way of looking at tennis now
most<00:00:27.419> people<00:00:27.509> are<00:00:27.810> actually<00:00:27.900> taught<00:00:28.320> and

00:00:28.729 --> 00:00:28.739 
most people are actually taught and

00:00:28.739 --> 00:00:30.649 
most people are actually taught and
therefore<00:00:29.249> look<00:00:29.489> at<00:00:29.640> the<00:00:29.730> game<00:00:29.939> in<00:00:30.089> terms<00:00:30.419> of

00:00:30.649 --> 00:00:30.659 
therefore look at the game in terms of

00:00:30.659 --> 00:00:34.580 
therefore look at the game in terms of
grips<00:00:31.409> swings<00:00:32.690> contact<00:00:33.690> points<00:00:34.020> etc<00:00:34.140> that's

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
grips swings contact points etc that's

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.880 
grips swings contact points etc that's
their<00:00:34.890> main<00:00:35.130> focus<00:00:35.430> so<00:00:36.180> they're<00:00:36.329> looking<00:00:36.720> at

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:36.890 
their main focus so they're looking at

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:39.470 
their main focus so they're looking at
technique<00:00:37.890> and<00:00:38.670> let<00:00:38.790> me<00:00:38.880> show<00:00:39.030> you<00:00:39.090> why<00:00:39.300> that's

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
technique and let me show you why that's

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.880 
technique and let me show you why that's
wrong<00:00:41.540> okay<00:00:42.540> so<00:00:42.600> this<00:00:42.810> is<00:00:42.960> a<00:00:42.990> new<00:00:43.290> way<00:00:43.530> that<00:00:43.860> I

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
wrong okay so this is a new way that I

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.070 
wrong okay so this is a new way that I
want<00:00:44.100> you<00:00:44.220> to<00:00:44.340> start<00:00:44.610> seeing<00:00:44.820> things<00:00:44.990> and<00:00:45.990> if

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:46.080 
want you to start seeing things and if

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:48.110 
want you to start seeing things and if
you<00:00:46.200> think<00:00:46.470> about<00:00:46.590> it<00:00:46.830> this<00:00:47.610> is<00:00:47.670> a<00:00:47.850> more

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
you think about it this is a more

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.330 
you think about it this is a more
natural<00:00:48.690> way<00:00:48.720> that<00:00:49.110> follows<00:00:49.500> the<00:00:49.740> actual

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
natural way that follows the actual

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.350 
natural way that follows the actual
chain<00:00:50.640> of<00:00:50.820> events<00:00:50.970> during<00:00:51.750> any<00:00:52.110> shot<00:00:52.620> or<00:00:52.950> point

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:53.360 
chain of events during any shot or point

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:57.440 
chain of events during any shot or point
so<00:00:54.360> stage<00:00:54.960> one<00:00:55.290> is<00:00:55.860> a<00:00:55.920> readiness<00:00:56.430> that's<00:00:57.270> where

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:57.450 
so stage one is a readiness that's where

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:59.290 
so stage one is a readiness that's where
I'm<00:00:57.540> looking<00:00:57.810> for<00:00:57.960> players<00:00:58.170> to<00:00:58.320> be<00:00:58.620> alert

00:00:59.290 --> 00:00:59.300 
I'm looking for players to be alert

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.940 
I'm looking for players to be alert
eager<00:01:00.300> ready<00:01:00.990> for<00:01:01.260> anything<00:01:01.500> you<00:01:01.800> can

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:01.950 
eager ready for anything you can

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:04.130 
eager ready for anything you can
actually<00:01:02.160> see<00:01:02.370> the<00:01:02.880> player<00:01:03.120> if<00:01:03.510> they're<00:01:03.930> ready

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
actually see the player if they're ready

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.649 
actually see the player if they're ready
you<00:01:04.949> can<00:01:05.100> see<00:01:05.369> in<00:01:05.549> their<00:01:05.759> eyes<00:01:05.790> if<00:01:06.180> you<00:01:06.210> haven't

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
you can see in their eyes if you haven't

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.960 
you can see in their eyes if you haven't
got<00:01:06.780> this<00:01:07.280> nothing<00:01:08.280> else<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:08.670> follows

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
got this nothing else the follows

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.670 
got this nothing else the follows
matters<00:01:09.590> stage<00:01:10.590> two<00:01:10.950> this<00:01:11.610> is<00:01:11.870> physicality<00:01:12.870> so

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
matters stage two this is physicality so

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.410 
matters stage two this is physicality so
now<00:01:13.980> once<00:01:14.310> the<00:01:14.490> player<00:01:14.700> has<00:01:14.790> been<00:01:14.820> ready<00:01:15.180> and
