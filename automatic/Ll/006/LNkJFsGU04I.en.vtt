00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
to get this one in the air I'm gonna

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:25.080 
to get this one in the air I'm gonna
plug<00:02:23.770> it<00:02:23.890> in<00:02:23.980> for<00:02:24.160> you<00:02:24.250> guys<00:02:24.430> right<00:02:24.640> now<00:02:24.670> so<00:02:25.000> you

I'm<00:02:30.190> just<00:02:30.460> running<00:02:30.700> the<00:02:31.230> just<00:02:32.230> a<00:02:32.320> simple<00:02:32.620> three

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:32.800 
I'm just running the just a simple three

I'm just running the just a simple three
cell<00:02:32.980> battery<00:02:33.310> just<00:02:33.520> with<00:02:33.670> my<00:02:33.790> video<00:02:34.060> out<00:02:34.210> I

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330 
cell battery just with my video out I

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:35.730 
cell battery just with my video out I
don't<00:02:34.390> have<00:02:34.570> my<00:02:34.690> camera<00:02:35.050> and<00:02:35.170> all<00:02:35.320> the<00:02:35.350> other

don't have my camera and all the other

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:37.620 
don't have my camera and all the other
components<00:02:36.070> in<00:02:36.370> there<00:02:36.520> but<00:02:37.000> as<00:02:37.150> you<00:02:37.300> can<00:02:37.390> see

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:37.630 
components in there but as you can see

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:40.620 
components in there but as you can see
the<00:02:37.960> HUD<00:02:38.290> display<00:02:38.680> is<00:02:38.890> just<00:02:39.850> similar<00:02:40.060> to<00:02:40.210> the

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:40.630 
the HUD display is just similar to the

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:43.230 
the HUD display is just similar to the
other<00:02:41.170> cyclops<00:02:41.650> products<00:02:42.070> like<00:02:42.520> the<00:02:42.790> storm

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:43.240 
other cyclops products like the storm

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:47.280 
other cyclops products like the storm
and<00:02:43.570> the<00:02:44.320> Nova<00:02:44.590> and<00:02:45.190> the<00:02:45.400> breeze<00:02:45.700> OSD<00:02:46.300> as<00:02:47.080> you

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
and the Nova and the breeze OSD as you

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:48.840 
and the Nova and the breeze OSD as you
can<00:02:47.440> see<00:02:47.620> this<00:02:47.800> one<00:02:47.980> has<00:02:48.130> the<00:02:48.190> artificial

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:48.850 
can see this one has the artificial

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:50.940 
can see this one has the artificial
horizon<00:02:48.970> just<00:02:49.540> like<00:02:49.690> the<00:02:49.810> other<00:02:49.930> ones<00:02:50.170> as<00:02:50.380> I'm

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
horizon just like the other ones as I'm

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:52.500 
horizon just like the other ones as I'm
tilting<00:02:51.340> it<00:02:51.490> another<00:02:52.030> thing<00:02:52.240> that<00:02:52.300> I've

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
tilting it another thing that I've

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:54.150 
tilting it another thing that I've
noticed<00:02:52.630> on<00:02:52.930> this<00:02:53.050> one<00:02:53.260> it's<00:02:53.650> got<00:02:53.830> blue<00:02:54.130> and

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
noticed on this one it's got blue and

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.790 
noticed on this one it's got blue and
red<00:02:54.610> LED<00:02:55.120> lights<00:02:55.450> the<00:02:56.110> other<00:02:56.230> one<00:02:56.410> I<00:02:56.590> don't

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:56.800 
red LED lights the other one I don't

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:59.040 
red LED lights the other one I don't
remember<00:02:56.980> seeing<00:02:57.310> the<00:02:58.180> blue<00:02:58.420> lights<00:02:58.720> I<00:02:58.870> do

00:02:59.040 --> 00:02:59.050 
remember seeing the blue lights I do

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:00.870 
remember seeing the blue lights I do
remember<00:02:59.380> seeing<00:02:59.530> the<00:02:59.680> LED<00:03:00.040> the<00:03:00.460> red<00:03:00.670> one

flashing<00:03:01.570> this<00:03:01.690> is<00:03:01.900> saying<00:03:02.410> that<00:03:02.530> it's

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
flashing this is saying that it's

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:04.860 
flashing this is saying that it's
acquiring<00:03:03.040> a<00:03:03.100> GPS<00:03:03.550> this<00:03:04.180> is<00:03:04.300> the<00:03:04.390> first<00:03:04.630> time<00:03:04.840> I

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:04.870 
acquiring a GPS this is the first time I

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:06.570 
acquiring a GPS this is the first time I
plugged<00:03:05.260> it<00:03:05.380> into<00:03:05.500> the<00:03:05.590> GPS<00:03:06.010> was<00:03:06.130> upside<00:03:06.550> down

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:06.580 
plugged it into the GPS was upside down

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:08.460 
plugged it into the GPS was upside down
I'm<00:03:07.000> in<00:03:07.060> the<00:03:07.240> garage<00:03:07.510> and<00:03:07.780> it's<00:03:07.900> upside<00:03:08.200> down

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:11.020 
and the garage door is closed and as you

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:12.150 
and the garage door is closed and as you
can<00:03:11.140> see<00:03:11.320> it<00:03:11.410> looks<00:03:11.560> like<00:03:11.680> I've<00:03:11.800> already<00:03:11.950> got

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:12.160 
can see it looks like I've already got

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:16.080 
can see it looks like I've already got
two<00:03:12.520> bars<00:03:12.850> of<00:03:13.180> GPS<00:03:13.800> I<00:03:14.800> haven't<00:03:15.730> got<00:03:15.820> a<00:03:15.850> full

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090 
two bars of GPS I haven't got a full

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:17.640 
two bars of GPS I haven't got a full
lock<00:03:16.330> yet<00:03:16.570> but<00:03:16.780> it<00:03:17.200> looks<00:03:17.380> like<00:03:17.440> it's

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
lock yet but it looks like it's

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:20.340 
lock yet but it looks like it's
acquiring<00:03:18.040> GPS<00:03:18.430> a<00:03:18.580> lot<00:03:19.150> faster<00:03:19.660> than<00:03:20.200> the

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:20.350 
acquiring GPS a lot faster than the

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:22.770 
acquiring GPS a lot faster than the
older<00:03:20.650> ones<00:03:21.180> anything<00:03:22.180> else<00:03:22.330> I<00:03:22.480> could<00:03:22.630> see

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:22.780 
older ones anything else I could see

just<00:03:31.360> like<00:03:31.480> the<00:03:31.600> old<00:03:31.630> system<00:03:32.140> but<00:03:32.590> now<00:03:32.740> it<00:03:32.920> has

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.130 
just like the old system but now it has

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:35.910 
just like the old system but now it has
two<00:03:33.640> options<00:03:34.300> actually<00:03:34.870> three<00:03:35.290> system

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:35.920 
two options actually three system

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:38.940 
two options actually three system
configurations<00:03:36.580> Waypoint<00:03:37.060> and<00:03:37.350> exit<00:03:38.350> so

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:38.950 
configurations Waypoint and exit so

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:41.100 
configurations Waypoint and exit so
system<00:03:39.490> configuration<00:03:40.150> looks<00:03:40.450> similar<00:03:40.750> to

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:41.110 
system configuration looks similar to

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:43.920 
system configuration looks similar to
the<00:03:41.290> storm<00:03:42.330> but<00:03:43.330> it<00:03:43.390> looks<00:03:43.600> like<00:03:43.750> there's

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:43.930 
the storm but it looks like there's

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:49.190 
the storm but it looks like there's
three<00:03:43.990> pages<00:03:44.560> of<00:03:45.240> data<00:03:46.240> this<00:03:46.870> is<00:03:47.050> all<00:03:47.260> of<00:03:47.470> our

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:25.800 
2,000 meters if you're running 2.4 this
is<00:04:24.610> a<00:04:24.640> great<00:04:24.850> feature<00:04:25.090> but<00:04:25.419> if<00:04:25.570> you're<00:04:25.690> running

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:25.810 
is a great feature but if you're running

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:28.620 
is a great feature but if you're running
UHF<00:04:26.410> I<00:04:26.620> would<00:04:27.010> turn<00:04:27.220> that<00:04:27.250> off<00:04:27.580> video<00:04:28.150> format

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:28.630 
UHF I would turn that off video format

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:29.690 
UHF I would turn that off video format
to<00:04:28.750> leave<00:04:28.870> that<00:04:29.050> on<00:04:29.169> auto

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:29.700

mode<00:04:37.560> so<00:04:37.920> I'm<00:04:38.010> gonna<00:04:38.160> go<00:04:38.250> ahead<00:04:38.310> and<00:04:38.430> try<00:04:38.670> that

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:38.700 
mode so I'm gonna go ahead and try that

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:41.150 
mode so I'm gonna go ahead and try that
out<00:04:38.940> also<00:04:39.380> so<00:04:40.380> let's<00:04:40.620> go<00:04:40.710> ahead<00:04:40.770> and<00:04:40.860> return

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:41.160 
out also so let's go ahead and return

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:43.760 
out also so let's go ahead and return
here<00:04:41.720> Waypoint<00:04:42.720> okay<00:04:43.350> it<00:04:43.470> looks<00:04:43.620> like<00:04:43.680> the

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:43.770 
here Waypoint okay it looks like the

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:46.400 
here Waypoint okay it looks like the
Waypoint<00:04:44.280> you<00:04:44.850> can<00:04:45.030> set<00:04:45.240> your<00:04:45.330> altitude<00:04:45.780> your

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:46.410 
Waypoint you can set your altitude your

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:50.750 
Waypoint you can set your altitude your
angle<00:04:47.400> of<00:04:47.460> attack<00:04:48.830> your<00:04:49.830> distance<00:04:50.310> okay<00:04:50.580> this

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:50.760 
angle of attack your distance okay this

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:53.150 
angle of attack your distance okay this
is<00:04:50.910> for<00:04:51.060> multiple<00:04:51.480> waypoints<00:04:51.960> so<00:04:52.530> you<00:04:52.980> just

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:53.160 
is for multiple waypoints so you just

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:54.830 
is for multiple waypoints so you just
pretty<00:04:53.310> much<00:04:53.490> set<00:04:53.820> the<00:04:53.940> distance<00:04:54.150> the

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:54.840 
pretty much set the distance the

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:57.890 
pretty much set the distance the
altitude<00:04:55.380> and<00:04:55.590> the<00:04:55.650> angle<00:04:56.100> and<00:04:56.610> you<00:04:57.480> can<00:04:57.630> set

00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:57.900 
altitude and the angle and you can set

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:03.800 
altitude and the angle and you can set
looks<00:04:58.530> like<00:04:58.770> up<00:04:59.040> to<00:05:00.980> eight<00:05:01.980> waypoints<00:05:02.850> us<00:05:03.090> if

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:03.810 
looks like up to eight waypoints us if

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:05.270 
looks like up to eight waypoints us if
I'm<00:05:03.960> not<00:05:04.110> mistaken

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:05.280 
I'm not mistaken

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:08.660 
I'm not mistaken
max<00:05:05.880> discharge<00:05:06.750> return<00:05:07.530> so<00:05:08.040> overall<00:05:08.430> this

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:08.670 
max discharge return so overall this

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:10.580 
max discharge return so overall this
looks<00:05:08.730> like<00:05:09.090> a<00:05:09.120> really<00:05:09.420> good<00:05:09.720> on<00:05:10.260> screen

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:10.590 
looks like a really good on screen

looks like a really good on screen

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:15.840 
this one to put in the talent because it

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:19.880
