very long hang time 130 days which is
absolutely<00:00:49.040> the<00:00:49.370> longest<00:00:49.790> in<00:00:49.850> history<00:00:49.880> they

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:50.870 
absolutely the longest in history they

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:52.570 
weren't for the most part

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:54.970 
weren't for the most part
physiologically<00:00:53.570> ripe<00:00:53.780> so<00:00:54.230> you<00:00:54.290> had<00:00:54.620> almost

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:54.980 
physiologically ripe so you had almost

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:57.220 
physiologically ripe so you had almost
as<00:00:55.280> crystal<00:00:55.850> markes<00:00:56.080> explained<00:00:57.080> in

artificial ripeness by the 15th
September<00:00:59.630> you<00:01:00.320> would<00:01:00.410> have<00:01:00.590> this<00:01:00.770> sudden

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:01.040 
September you would have this sudden

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.509 
September you would have this sudden
sort<00:01:01.490> of<00:01:02.200> transfusion<00:01:03.200> insta<00:01:03.980> grapes<00:01:04.220> which

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:04.519 
sort of transfusion insta grapes which

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:07.240 
sort of transfusion insta grapes which
made<00:01:04.759> the<00:01:04.879> ripe<00:01:05.350> even<00:01:06.350> they<00:01:06.710> were<00:01:06.770> ripe<00:01:07.040> in

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:07.250 
made the ripe even they were ripe in

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:08.980 
made the ripe even they were ripe in
terms<00:01:07.460> of<00:01:07.580> alcohol<00:01:07.939> and<00:01:08.090> sugar<00:01:08.360> but<00:01:08.900> they

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:08.990 
terms of alcohol and sugar but they

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:12.880 
terms of alcohol and sugar but they
actually<00:01:09.320> weren't<00:01:09.499> ripe<00:01:10.310> up<00:01:10.579> there<00:01:10.969> and<00:01:11.890> the

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:12.890 
actually weren't ripe up there and the

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:15.789 
actually weren't ripe up there and the
question<00:01:13.189> was<00:01:13.219> do<00:01:13.579> pick<00:01:13.789> them<00:01:14.329> or<00:01:15.200> do<00:01:15.439> you<00:01:15.530> hope

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:15.799 
question was do pick them or do you hope

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:17.889 
question was do pick them or do you hope
that<00:01:15.829> they'll<00:01:16.219> take<00:01:16.759> on<00:01:16.939> this<00:01:17.149> intellectual

00:01:17.889 --> 00:01:17.899 
that they'll take on this intellectual

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:19.419 
that they'll take on this intellectual
wipers<00:01:18.289> take<00:01:18.530> on<00:01:18.679> this<00:01:18.829> physiological

00:01:19.419 --> 00:01:19.429 
wipers take on this physiological

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:21.999 
wipers take on this physiological
ripeness<00:01:19.939> and<00:01:20.270> I<00:01:21.259> think<00:01:21.530> the<00:01:21.679> people<00:01:21.859> who

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:22.009 
ripeness and I think the people who

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:24.730 
ripeness and I think the people who
picked<00:01:22.429> earlier<00:01:22.939> made<00:01:23.719> a<00:01:23.749> wonderful<00:01:24.140> charming

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:24.740 
picked earlier made a wonderful charming

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:26.999 
picked earlier made a wonderful charming
wine<00:01:24.920> and<00:01:25.280> the<00:01:26.149> people<00:01:26.420> who<00:01:26.450> picked<00:01:26.749> later

00:01:26.999 --> 00:01:27.009 
wine and the people who picked later

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:29.230 
wine and the people who picked later
sometimes<00:01:28.009> they<00:01:28.249> extracted<00:01:28.609> to<00:01:28.909> a<00:01:28.939> monster

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.240 
sometimes they extracted to a monster

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.230 
sometimes they extracted to a monster
sometimes<00:01:29.450> it<00:01:30.319> worked<00:01:30.619> but<00:01:31.009> the<00:01:31.340> one<00:01:31.640> rule<00:01:31.969> I

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.240 
sometimes it worked but the one rule I

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.209 
sometimes it worked but the one rule I
find<00:01:32.569> in<00:01:32.719> this<00:01:32.840> vintage<00:01:33.229> is<00:01:33.499> the<00:01:33.859> people<00:01:34.130> who

00:01:34.209 --> 00:01:34.219 
find in this vintage is the people who

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:36.190 
find in this vintage is the people who
went<00:01:34.429> for<00:01:34.609> extraction<00:01:35.149> which<00:01:35.539> has<00:01:35.689> been<00:01:35.929> a

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:36.200 
went for extraction which has been a

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.469 
went for extraction which has been a
Bordeaux<00:01:36.859> habit<00:01:37.249> to<00:01:37.490> extract<00:01:37.909> the<00:01:38.090> biggest

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:38.479 
Bordeaux habit to extract the biggest

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:41.559 
Bordeaux habit to extract the biggest
one<00:01:39.189> didn't<00:01:40.189> it<00:01:40.549> didn't<00:01:40.819> work<00:01:40.939> well<00:01:41.149> because

00:01:41.559 --> 00:01:41.569 
one didn't it didn't work well because

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:43.330 
one didn't it didn't work well because
this<00:01:41.780> is<00:01:41.960> not<00:01:42.170> a<00:01:42.229> vintage<00:01:42.619> to<00:01:42.799> extract<00:01:43.189> this

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:43.340 
this is not a vintage to extract this

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.090 
this is not a vintage to extract this
advantage<00:01:43.880> as<00:01:44.450> Christian<00:01:45.020> works<00:01:45.289> also<00:01:45.770> said

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:46.100 
advantage as Christian works also said

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.399 
advantage as Christian works also said
to<00:01:46.130> go<00:01:46.369> with<00:01:46.520> the<00:01:46.609> fruit<00:01:46.850> and<00:01:47.149> I<00:01:47.869> think<00:01:48.139> it's<00:01:48.289> a

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:48.409 
to go with the fruit and I think it's a

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:50.499 
to go with the fruit and I think it's a
non<00:01:48.590> speculative<00:01:49.219> vintage<00:01:49.579> because<00:01:49.819> it's<00:01:50.359> a

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:50.509 
non speculative vintage because it's a

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:53.469 
non speculative vintage because it's a
lovely<00:01:50.840> fruity<00:01:51.319> vintage<00:01:51.679> a<00:01:51.969> little<00:01:52.969> bit<00:01:53.119> like

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:53.479 
lovely fruity vintage a little bit like

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:56.919 
lovely fruity vintage a little bit like
2004<00:01:54.319> with<00:01:54.920> a<00:01:54.950> bit<00:01:55.130> more<00:01:55.159> charm<00:01:55.630> better<00:01:56.630> than<00:01:56.899> a

00:01:56.919 --> 00:01:56.929 
2004 with a bit more charm better than a

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:59.859 
2004 with a bit more charm better than a
little<00:01:57.439> less<00:01:57.649> seriousness<00:01:58.280> better<00:01:58.939> than<00:01:59.119> 2002

00:01:59.859 --> 00:01:59.869 
little less seriousness better than 2002

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:03.309 
little less seriousness better than 2002
and<00:02:00.279> the<00:02:01.279> wines<00:02:01.520> of<00:02:01.819> the<00:02:02.149> wines<00:02:02.630> are<00:02:02.779> very<00:02:02.959> very

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:07.029 
and the wines of the wines are very very
nice<00:02:03.799> wines<00:02:04.149> but<00:02:05.149> they're<00:02:06.109> not<00:02:06.259> in<00:02:06.529> my<00:02:06.560> view

nice wines but they're not in my view
they're<00:02:07.369> not<00:02:07.490> long-term<00:02:07.789> wines<00:02:08.270> I<00:02:08.600> mean

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:08.869 
they're not long-term wines I mean

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:09.940

that's<00:02:09.080> horrible

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:13.780

six<00:02:10.759> five<00:02:11.480> to<00:02:11.870> twelve<00:02:12.260> year<00:02:12.440> wise<00:02:12.620> and<00:02:13.040> I<00:02:13.550> think

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
six five to twelve year wise and I think

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:18.040 
six five to twelve year wise and I think
if<00:02:13.910> people<00:02:13.940> view<00:02:14.629> the<00:02:14.660> vintage<00:02:15.200> as<00:02:16.599> saved<00:02:17.599> from

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.050 
if people view the vintage as saved from

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:21.280
