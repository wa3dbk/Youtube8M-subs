00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:33.830 
oh cool what you think about the team so
far<00:00:32.219> I<00:00:32.430> mean<00:00:32.610> I<00:00:32.669> know<00:00:32.730> it's<00:00:33.450> early<00:00:33.570> in<00:00:33.809> the

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
far I mean I know it's early in the

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.709 
far I mean I know it's early in the
season<00:00:33.930> but<00:00:34.260> I<00:00:34.770> think<00:00:35.760> we're<00:00:35.940> uh<00:00:35.969> you<00:00:36.600> know<00:00:36.690> a

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
season but I think we're uh you know a

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.150 
season but I think we're uh you know a
pretty<00:00:36.960> good<00:00:37.079> team<00:00:37.200> obviously<00:00:37.380> a<00:00:37.680> lot<00:00:38.040> of

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
pretty good team obviously a lot of

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.950 
pretty good team obviously a lot of
talent<00:00:38.550> and<00:00:38.670> you<00:00:39.000> know<00:00:39.120> a<00:00:39.149> lot<00:00:39.390> of<00:00:39.420> offensive

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
talent and you know a lot of offensive

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.540 
talent and you know a lot of offensive
ability<00:00:40.379> but<00:00:40.559> I<00:00:40.770> think<00:00:41.040> overall<00:00:41.309> we're

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
ability but I think overall we're

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.030 
ability but I think overall we're
playing<00:00:41.760> very<00:00:41.940> well<00:00:42.090> defensively<00:00:42.450> and<00:00:42.930> in<00:00:43.890> all

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
playing very well defensively and in all

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.860 
playing very well defensively and in all
aspects<00:00:44.430> of<00:00:44.430> our<00:00:44.550> game<00:00:44.730> really<00:00:44.940> but<00:00:45.120> obviously

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
aspects of our game really but obviously

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.630 
aspects of our game really but obviously
it's<00:00:46.590> early<00:00:46.950> in<00:00:47.010> the<00:00:47.039> season<00:00:47.129> we're<00:00:47.460> still

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
it's early in the season we're still

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.690 
it's early in the season we're still
getting<00:00:47.910> adjusted<00:00:48.120> to<00:00:48.539> each<00:00:48.719> other<00:00:48.989> and<00:00:49.700> you

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
getting adjusted to each other and you

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.069 
getting adjusted to each other and you
know<00:00:50.730> the<00:00:50.910> lines<00:00:51.149> are<00:00:51.360> still<00:00:51.539> getting<00:00:51.780> you

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
know the lines are still getting you

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.540 
know the lines are still getting you
know<00:00:52.230> gaining<00:00:52.469> chemistry<00:00:53.100> and<00:00:53.280> things<00:00:53.430> like

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
know gaining chemistry and things like

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:54.979 
know gaining chemistry and things like
that<00:00:53.610> so<00:00:53.820> we'll<00:00:54.239> get<00:00:54.390> better<00:00:54.539> as<00:00:54.780> the<00:00:54.870> year

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
that so we'll get better as the year

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.630 
that so we'll get better as the year
goes<00:00:55.020> on<00:00:55.289> but<00:00:55.500> I<00:00:55.559> think<00:00:55.800> we've<00:00:56.280> had<00:00:56.399> a<00:00:56.430> pretty

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
goes on but I think we've had a pretty

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.459
