max on bench was 275 improved that to

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:39.809 
max on bench was 275 improved that to
295<00:02:36.489> and<00:02:36.910> two<00:02:37.150> months<00:02:37.360> only<00:02:38.170> do<00:02:39.099> my<00:02:39.310> one<00:02:39.579> rep

00:02:39.809 --> 00:02:39.819 
295 and two months only do my one rep

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:43.020 
295 and two months only do my one rep
max<00:02:40.110> once<00:02:41.110> a<00:02:41.290> month<00:02:41.470> maybe<00:02:42.130> once<00:02:42.519> a<00:02:42.640> month<00:02:42.670> I

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
max once a month maybe once a month I

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:45.270 
max once a month maybe once a month I
don't<00:02:43.209> like<00:02:43.329> to<00:02:43.480> do<00:02:43.599> it<00:02:43.630> I'm<00:02:43.870> not<00:02:44.019> a<00:02:44.280> power

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
don't like to do it I'm not a power

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.250 
don't like to do it I'm not a power
lifter<00:02:45.700> so<00:02:45.910> I<00:02:45.940> just<00:02:46.150> like<00:02:46.269> to<00:02:46.420> see<00:02:46.630> test<00:02:47.079> my

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
lifter so I just like to see test my

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.039 
lifter so I just like to see test my
stuff<00:02:47.500> see<00:02:47.680> how<00:02:47.799> much<00:02:48.099> stronger<00:02:48.489> I've<00:02:48.610> gotten

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:49.049 
stuff see how much stronger I've gotten

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:51.559 
stuff see how much stronger I've gotten
so<00:02:50.049> that's<00:02:50.170> about<00:02:50.380> 20<00:02:50.650> pounds<00:02:50.799> of<00:02:50.980> two<00:02:51.160> months

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:51.569 
so that's about 20 pounds of two months

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:53.819 
so that's about 20 pounds of two months
might<00:02:52.569> not<00:02:52.750> seem<00:02:53.079> like<00:02:53.140> a<00:02:53.290> lot<00:02:53.380> to<00:02:53.650> a<00:02:53.680> lot<00:02:53.769> of

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:53.829 
might not seem like a lot to a lot of

00:02:53.829 --> 00:02:55.289 
might not seem like a lot to a lot of
you<00:02:53.950> guys<00:02:53.980> but<00:02:54.459> I've<00:02:54.640> only<00:02:54.760> been<00:02:54.940> working<00:02:55.060> out
