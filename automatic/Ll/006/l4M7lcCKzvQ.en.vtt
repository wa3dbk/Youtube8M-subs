00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:49.090 
really really like the way that it

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:52.470 
really really like the way that it
turned<00:00:49.210> out<00:00:49.450> I<00:00:49.720> like<00:00:50.050> fades<00:00:50.410> in<00:00:50.649> so<00:00:51.329> it's<00:00:52.329> a

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:52.480 
turned out I like fades in so it's a

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.690 
turned out I like fades in so it's a
little<00:00:52.720> bit<00:00:52.840> more<00:00:53.079> like<00:00:53.340> greenish<00:00:54.340> with

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:54.700 
little bit more like greenish with

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:56.639 
little bit more like greenish with
yellow<00:00:55.300> undertones<00:00:55.960> up<00:00:56.140> here<00:00:56.350> and<00:00:56.440> then<00:00:56.530> it

00:00:56.639 --> 00:00:56.649 
yellow undertones up here and then it

00:00:56.649 --> 00:00:58.889 
yellow undertones up here and then it
goes<00:00:56.770> smack<00:00:57.250> dab<00:00:57.640> to<00:00:57.910> the<00:00:58.059> like<00:00:58.270> aqua

00:00:58.889 --> 00:00:58.899 
goes smack dab to the like aqua

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:01.080 
goes smack dab to the like aqua
turquoise<00:00:59.260> so<00:00:59.980> she<00:01:00.070> definitely<00:01:00.670> tried<00:01:01.000> to

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:01.090 
turquoise so she definitely tried to

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:03.299 
turquoise so she definitely tried to
like<00:01:01.239> fan<00:01:01.540> it<00:01:01.690> out<00:01:01.840> so<00:01:02.079> it's<00:01:02.230> not<00:01:02.410> just<00:01:02.860> a<00:01:02.950> block

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:03.309 
like fan it out so it's not just a block

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:05.460 
like fan it out so it's not just a block
of<00:01:03.579> blue<00:01:03.820> I<00:01:04.149> think<00:01:04.360> it's<00:01:04.720> just<00:01:04.839> going<00:01:05.020> to<00:01:05.110> be<00:01:05.229> so

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:05.470 
of blue I think it's just going to be so

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:07.980 
of blue I think it's just going to be so
much<00:01:05.590> fun<00:01:05.890> to<00:01:06.280> kind<00:01:06.880> of<00:01:06.970> style<00:01:07.300> my<00:01:07.540> makeup

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:07.990 
much fun to kind of style my makeup

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:09.870 
much fun to kind of style my makeup
around<00:01:08.440> my<00:01:08.590> hair<00:01:08.860> because<00:01:09.190> I'm<00:01:09.399> wearing<00:01:09.610> like
