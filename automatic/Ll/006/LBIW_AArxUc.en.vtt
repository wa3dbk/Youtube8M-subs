00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099 
hi I got a package in the mail oh yeah

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:13.460 
hi I got a package in the mail oh yeah
let's<00:00:08.639> get<00:00:08.790> into<00:00:08.910> it

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:13.470 

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:18.540 

okay<00:00:14.470> so<00:00:15.720> here's<00:00:16.720> the<00:00:16.810> cube<00:00:17.140> I<00:00:17.230> got<00:00:17.440> I<00:00:17.740> got<00:00:18.520> a

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:18.550 
okay so here's the cube I got I got a

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:28.790 
okay so here's the cube I got I got a
7x7<00:00:19.410> Changsha<00:00:20.439> let's<00:00:21.010> open<00:00:21.160> up<00:00:21.340> the<00:00:21.490> box<00:00:25.590> here

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.060 

okay

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:30.070 
okay

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:33.240 
okay
it<00:00:30.130> is<00:00:30.699> very<00:00:30.970> oily<00:00:31.770> expecting<00:00:32.770> that<00:00:32.890> to<00:00:33.070> happen

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:33.250 
it is very oily expecting that to happen

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:37.939 
it is very oily expecting that to happen
I<00:00:33.699> have<00:00:34.390> a<00:00:34.420> nice<00:00:34.720> damp<00:00:35.230> rag<00:00:36.420> to<00:00:37.420> wipe<00:00:37.449> it<00:00:37.720> down

00:00:37.939 --> 00:00:37.949 
I have a nice damp rag to wipe it down

00:00:37.949 --> 00:00:41.040 
I have a nice damp rag to wipe it down
before<00:00:38.949> we<00:00:38.980> get<00:00:39.190> in<00:00:39.370> first<00:00:39.610> turns<00:00:40.000> let's<00:00:40.840> do<00:00:41.019> a

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:41.050 
before we get in first turns let's do a

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:45.950 
before we get in first turns let's do a
size<00:00:41.320> comparison<00:00:41.760> here's<00:00:42.760> a<00:00:42.850> shank<00:00:43.150> shell<00:00:43.360> 6x6

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
size comparison here's a shank shell 6x6

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.780 
size comparison here's a shank shell 6x6
it's<00:00:46.960> about<00:00:47.140> six<00:00:47.409> layers<00:00:47.620> really<00:00:47.949> I'm<00:00:48.430> some<00:00:48.699> of

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:48.790 
it's about six layers really I'm some of

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:54.630 
it's about six layers really I'm some of
my<00:00:48.879> seven<00:00:49.150> let's<00:00:49.600> get<00:00:49.780> in<00:00:49.870> first<00:00:50.110> turns<00:00:53.640> right

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:54.640 
my seven let's get in first turns right

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.270 
my seven let's get in first turns right
off<00:00:54.760> the<00:00:54.909> bat<00:00:55.120> that<00:00:55.449> is<00:00:55.839> extremely<00:00:56.350> smooth<00:00:56.739> the

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:57.280 
off the bat that is extremely smooth the

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.630 
off the bat that is extremely smooth the
outer<00:00:57.489> layer<00:00:57.850> is<00:00:58.210> very<00:00:58.989> good<00:00:59.350> it<00:00:59.890> just<00:01:00.159> feels

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:00.640 
outer layer is very good it just feels

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:05.280 
outer layer is very good it just feels
like<00:01:00.879> the<00:01:01.120> slightest<00:01:01.809> bit<00:01:02.260> of<00:01:03.839> dryness<00:01:04.839> like

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:05.290 
like the slightest bit of dryness like

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:07.200 
like the slightest bit of dryness like
it<00:01:05.409> needs<00:01:05.560> to<00:01:05.680> be<00:01:05.770> lubricated<00:01:05.979> let's<00:01:06.970> try<00:01:07.150> two

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:07.210 
it needs to be lubricated let's try two

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:14.060 
it needs to be lubricated let's try two
layers<00:01:07.600> oh<00:01:09.450> yeah<00:01:10.450> so<00:01:11.140> smooth<00:01:11.670> three<00:01:12.670> layers<00:01:12.880> oh

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
layers oh yeah so smooth three layers oh

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.219 
layers oh yeah so smooth three layers oh
my<00:01:15.070> gosh<00:01:15.420> let's<00:01:16.420> do<00:01:16.570> a<00:01:16.630> checkerboard<00:01:17.020> pattern

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:17.229 
my gosh let's do a checkerboard pattern

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:28.649 
my gosh let's do a checkerboard pattern
to<00:01:17.619> test<00:01:17.649> out<00:01:18.009> all<00:01:18.250> the<00:01:18.430> layers<00:01:27.030> yeah<00:01:28.030> check

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:28.659 
to test out all the layers yeah check

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:33.209 
to test out all the layers yeah check
that<00:01:28.689> out<00:01:28.869> every<00:01:29.560> single<00:01:30.520> layer<00:01:30.700> turns<00:01:32.219> so

00:01:33.209 --> 00:01:33.219 
that out every single layer turns so

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:36.300 
that out every single layer turns so
good<00:01:33.460> oh<00:01:33.750> man<00:01:34.750> that<00:01:35.020> is<00:01:35.049> so<00:01:35.469> much<00:01:35.530> better<00:01:36.039> than

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:36.310 
good oh man that is so much better than

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:38.999 
good oh man that is so much better than
my<00:01:36.490> vq<00:01:37.420> let's<00:01:38.259> quickly<00:01:38.619> test<00:01:38.829> out

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:39.009 
my vq let's quickly test out

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:40.859 
my vq let's quickly test out
corner-cutting<00:01:39.490> let's<00:01:40.090> do<00:01:40.240> three<00:01:40.509> quarters

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:40.869 
corner-cutting let's do three quarters

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:46.260 
corner-cutting let's do three quarters
of<00:01:40.899> a<00:01:41.049> QB<00:01:41.380> oh<00:01:41.560> yeah<00:01:42.609> easy<00:01:43.350> full<00:01:44.350> a<00:01:45.270> little

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:46.270 
of a QB oh yeah easy full a little

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:49.830 
of a QB oh yeah easy full a little
harder<00:01:46.600> more<00:01:47.399> no<00:01:48.399> so<00:01:48.880> I<00:01:49.240> think<00:01:49.390> that's

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:49.840 
harder more no so I think that's

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.069 
harder more no so I think that's
probably<00:01:49.990> gonna<00:01:50.229> get<00:01:50.409> better<00:01:50.710> over<00:01:51.609> time<00:01:52.079> but

00:01:53.069 --> 00:01:53.079 
probably gonna get better over time but

00:01:53.079 --> 00:01:55.080 
probably gonna get better over time but
that's<00:01:53.649> all<00:01:53.979> I'm<00:01:54.130> really<00:01:54.340> gonna<00:01:54.460> tell<00:01:54.939> you

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:55.090 
that's all I'm really gonna tell you

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:57.870 
that's all I'm really gonna tell you
about<00:01:55.270> this<00:01:55.600> cube<00:01:55.960> so<00:01:56.920> far

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:57.880 
about this cube so far

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.469 
about this cube so far
first<00:01:58.450> impressions<00:01:59.049> are<00:02:00.299> extremely<00:02:01.299> good

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:01.479 
first impressions are extremely good

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:06.630 
first impressions are extremely good
this<00:02:01.810> cube<00:02:02.140> is<00:02:02.289> so<00:02:02.819> so<00:02:03.819> amazing<00:02:04.950> and<00:02:05.950> it<00:02:06.369> feels

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640 
this cube is so so amazing and it feels

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.880 
this cube is so so amazing and it feels
actually<00:02:06.909> it's<00:02:07.359> a<00:02:07.450> pretty<00:02:07.810> nice<00:02:08.170> size<00:02:08.500> in<00:02:08.770> my

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:08.890 
actually it's a pretty nice size in my

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:10.499 
actually it's a pretty nice size in my
hand

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:10.509 
hand

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:13.110 
hand
it<00:02:10.840> actually<00:02:11.020> feels<00:02:11.440> much<00:02:12.250> much<00:02:12.580> smoother

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
it actually feels much much smoother

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.900 
it actually feels much much smoother
than<00:02:13.150> the<00:02:13.390> shank<00:02:13.630> shell<00:02:13.810> 6x6<00:02:14.520> this<00:02:15.520> one<00:02:15.730> just

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
than the shank shell 6x6 this one just

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.000 
than the shank shell 6x6 this one just
blows<00:02:16.270> it<00:02:16.300> right<00:02:16.630> out<00:02:16.780> of<00:02:16.840> the<00:02:16.930> water<00:02:17.140> anyway

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
blows it right out of the water anyway

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:19.680 
blows it right out of the water anyway
I'm<00:02:18.160> gonna<00:02:18.280> leave<00:02:18.490> you<00:02:18.610> with<00:02:18.640> that<00:02:18.910> I'll<00:02:19.360> come
