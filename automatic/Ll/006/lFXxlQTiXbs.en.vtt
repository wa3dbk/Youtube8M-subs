hey<00:00:01.550> guys<00:00:01.790> here's<00:00:02.689> my<00:00:03.520> cnc<00:00:05.109> dremel<00:00:06.109> router

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:07.240 
hey guys here's my cnc dremel router

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:11.620 
hey guys here's my cnc dremel router
concept<00:00:08.240> that<00:00:08.450> I<00:00:08.510> just<00:00:08.810> came<00:00:08.990> up<00:00:09.050> with<00:00:10.630> I'm

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:11.630 
concept that I just came up with I'm

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:14.830 
concept that I just came up with I'm
just<00:00:11.840> gonna<00:00:11.990> kind<00:00:12.290> of<00:00:12.380> run<00:00:12.710> you<00:00:12.920> through<00:00:13.840> the

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:14.840 
just gonna kind of run you through the

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:20.890 
just gonna kind of run you through the
dimensions<00:00:15.740> and<00:00:16.630> functionality<00:00:17.710> I<00:00:19.810> kind<00:00:20.810> of

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:20.900 
dimensions and functionality I kind of

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.290 
dimensions and functionality I kind of
designed<00:00:21.320> this<00:00:21.530> and<00:00:21.770> modeled<00:00:22.190> this<00:00:22.340> this<00:00:23.060> in

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:23.300 
designed this and modeled this this in

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.330 
designed this and modeled this this in
the<00:00:23.690> past<00:00:23.930> three<00:00:24.230> hours<00:00:24.260> so<00:00:24.800> that<00:00:25.039> it's

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:25.340 
the past three hours so that it's

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:29.939 
the past three hours so that it's
definitely<00:00:26.200> and<00:00:27.200> it's<00:00:27.650> very<00:00:27.950> first<00:00:28.550> stages<00:00:29.240> of

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:29.949 
definitely and it's very first stages of

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:38.520 
definitely and it's very first stages of
design<00:00:31.870> so<00:00:32.870> any<00:00:34.180> any<00:00:35.180> comments<00:00:35.900> or<00:00:36.160> tips<00:00:37.160> or

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:38.530 
design so any any comments or tips or

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:41.050 
design so any any comments or tips or
concerns<00:00:39.530> or<00:00:39.710> anything<00:00:39.950> please<00:00:40.520> let<00:00:40.760> me<00:00:40.820> know

and yeah let me know what you think so

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:49.180 
and yeah let me know what you think so
just<00:00:47.720> kind<00:00:48.020> of<00:00:48.079> get<00:00:48.230> into<00:00:48.410> this<00:00:48.620> here<00:00:48.920> so

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:49.190 
just kind of get into this here so

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:52.240 
just kind of get into this here so
here's<00:00:49.460> my<00:00:49.579> x-axis<00:00:50.350> this<00:00:51.350> board<00:00:51.680> here<00:00:52.040> it

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:52.250 
here's my x-axis this board here it

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:54.220 
here's my x-axis this board here it
moves<00:00:52.489> along<00:00:52.640> these<00:00:52.940> rails<00:00:53.390> on<00:00:53.719> the<00:00:53.750> bottom

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:54.230 
moves along these rails on the bottom

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:58.810 
moves along these rails on the bottom
and<00:00:55.870> which<00:00:56.870> looking<00:00:57.410> at<00:00:57.559> this<00:00:57.710> thing<00:00:58.010> now<00:00:58.219> I'm

00:00:58.810 --> 00:00:58.820 
and which looking at this thing now I'm

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:00.130 
and which looking at this thing now I'm
thinking<00:00:59.149> like<00:00:59.210> if<00:00:59.540> I'm<00:00:59.690> doing<00:00:59.719> some

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:00.140 
thinking like if I'm doing some

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:02.500 
thinking like if I'm doing some
woodworking<00:01:00.649> for<00:01:01.040> like<00:01:01.340> an<00:01:01.489> RC<00:01:01.879> plane<00:01:01.910> cutting

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:02.510 
woodworking for like an RC plane cutting

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:06.160 
woodworking for like an RC plane cutting
out<00:01:02.600> some<00:01:02.840> some<00:01:03.649> pieces<00:01:04.659> if<00:01:05.659> I<00:01:05.749> do<00:01:05.810> a<00:01:05.929> lot<00:01:06.139> of

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:06.170 
out some some pieces if I do a lot of

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:08.709 
out some some pieces if I do a lot of
that<00:01:06.409> all<00:01:06.859> that<00:01:07.249> all<00:01:07.429> that<00:01:07.490> debris<00:01:07.909> might

00:01:08.709 --> 00:01:08.719 
that all that all that debris might

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:12.359 
that all that all that debris might
start<00:01:09.139> to<00:01:09.350> build<00:01:09.590> up<00:01:09.770> in<00:01:09.920> these<00:01:10.069> tracks<00:01:10.490> and

00:01:12.359 --> 00:01:12.369 
start to build up in these tracks and

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:16.469 
start to build up in these tracks and
cause<00:01:13.369> some<00:01:13.729> jamming<00:01:14.270> issues<00:01:14.689> and<00:01:15.039> movement

00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:16.479 
cause some jamming issues and movement

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:19.949 
cause some jamming issues and movement
impede<00:01:17.479> meant<00:01:17.719> for<00:01:18.219> for<00:01:19.219> these<00:01:19.369> little

00:01:19.949 --> 00:01:19.959 
impede meant for for these little

00:01:19.959 --> 00:01:25.599 
impede meant for for these little
casters<00:01:20.959> here<00:01:21.259> so<00:01:22.159> I<00:01:22.639> might<00:01:24.159> more<00:01:25.159> than<00:01:25.369> likely

00:01:25.599 --> 00:01:25.609 
casters here so I might more than likely

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:27.639 
casters here so I might more than likely
I<00:01:25.789> have<00:01:25.880> to<00:01:26.060> revisit<00:01:26.420> that<00:01:26.719> and<00:01:27.020> have<00:01:27.319> to<00:01:27.469> come

00:01:27.639 --> 00:01:27.649 
I have to revisit that and have to come

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:32.559 
I have to revisit that and have to come
up<00:01:27.679> with<00:01:27.889> something<00:01:28.130> but<00:01:28.459> anyways<00:01:29.679> so<00:01:31.569> here's

00:01:32.559 --> 00:01:32.569 
up with something but anyways so here's

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:35.379 
up with something but anyways so here's
my<00:01:32.689> x-axis<00:01:33.109> it<00:01:33.499> goes<00:01:33.709> moves<00:01:34.609> back<00:01:34.939> to<00:01:35.119> their

00:01:35.379 --> 00:01:35.389 
my x-axis it goes moves back to their

00:01:35.389 --> 00:01:40.179 
my x-axis it goes moves back to their
moves<00:01:36.319> forward<00:01:36.740> to<00:01:36.859> their<00:01:38.770> so<00:01:39.770> we'll<00:01:40.009> give<00:01:40.159> you

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:40.189 
moves forward to their so we'll give you

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:45.819 
moves forward to their so we'll give you
a<00:01:40.310> little<00:01:40.490> side<00:01:40.700> view<00:01:43.659> so<00:01:44.659> let's<00:01:45.109> put<00:01:45.740> the

00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:45.829 
a little side view so let's put the

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:53.980 
a little side view so let's put the
Dremel<00:01:46.279> down<00:01:46.459> a<00:01:46.490> little<00:01:46.819> bit<00:01:50.590> so<00:01:52.779> goes<00:01:53.779> all<00:01:53.959> the

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:53.990 
Dremel down a little bit so goes all the

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:57.339 
Dremel down a little bit so goes all the
way<00:01:54.109> forward<00:01:54.439> to<00:01:54.529> there<00:01:55.060> goes<00:01:56.060> back<00:01:56.419> to<00:01:57.079> where

00:01:57.339 --> 00:01:57.349 
way forward to there goes back to where

00:01:57.349 --> 00:02:04.389 
way forward to there goes back to where
the<00:01:57.499> stepper<00:01:57.739> motor<00:01:57.859> should<00:01:58.849> be<00:02:01.389> okay<00:02:03.399> then

00:02:04.389 --> 00:02:04.399 
the stepper motor should be okay then

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:08.809 
the stepper motor should be okay then
let's<00:02:04.700> get<00:02:04.880> a<00:02:04.939> front<00:02:05.270> view<00:02:06.849> that's<00:02:07.849> not<00:02:08.060> from

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
let's get a front view that's not from

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:14.899 
let's get a front view that's not from
from<00:02:09.750> the<00:02:09.840> video<00:02:11.209> okay<00:02:12.209> so<00:02:12.239> here's<00:02:12.840> the<00:02:13.909> we're

00:02:14.899 --> 00:02:14.909 
from the video okay so here's the we're

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:19.280 
from the video okay so here's the we're
gonna<00:02:15.000> see<00:02:15.239> the<00:02:15.390> y-axis<00:02:16.430> right<00:02:17.430> here<00:02:17.849> so<00:02:18.540> we<00:02:19.109> go

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
gonna see the y-axis right here so we go

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.009 
gonna see the y-axis right here so we go
all<00:02:19.500> the<00:02:19.620> way<00:02:19.650> to<00:02:19.769> the<00:02:19.950> right<00:02:20.129> stops<00:02:20.969> there<00:02:21.299> so

00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:22.019 
all the way to the right stops there so

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:23.690 
all the way to the right stops there so
you<00:02:22.109> can<00:02:22.230> see<00:02:22.409> the<00:02:22.530> Dremel<00:02:23.010> gets<00:02:23.219> all<00:02:23.459> the<00:02:23.609> way

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
you can see the Dremel gets all the way

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.539 
you can see the Dremel gets all the way
to<00:02:23.760> the<00:02:23.969> edge<00:02:24.090> of<00:02:24.390> the<00:02:24.569> cutting<00:02:25.250> cutting<00:02:26.250> board

00:02:26.539 --> 00:02:26.549 
to the edge of the cutting cutting board

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:29.869 
to the edge of the cutting cutting board
so<00:02:26.879> that's<00:02:27.060> great<00:02:27.269> then<00:02:28.230> we'll<00:02:28.560> move<00:02:29.159> this<00:02:29.370> all

00:02:29.869 --> 00:02:29.879 
so that's great then we'll move this all

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:33.170 
so that's great then we'll move this all
the<00:02:29.939> way<00:02:30.269> over<00:02:30.689> and<00:02:31.489> again<00:02:32.489> all<00:02:32.939> the<00:02:33.030> way<00:02:33.060> to

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
the way over and again all the way to

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:37.479 
the way over and again all the way to
the<00:02:33.299> edge<00:02:33.480> so<00:02:34.099> pretty<00:02:35.099> happy<00:02:35.400> about<00:02:35.430> that<00:02:35.959> part

00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:37.489 
the edge so pretty happy about that part

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:48.409 
the edge so pretty happy about that part
the<00:02:38.489> Z<00:02:42.049> so<00:02:43.049> different<00:02:43.889> video<00:02:46.370> so<00:02:47.370> the<00:02:47.730> z<00:02:47.939> axis

00:02:48.409 --> 00:02:48.419 
the Z so different video so the z axis

00:02:48.419 --> 00:02:51.970 
the Z so different video so the z axis
actually<00:02:48.989> I<00:02:49.430> just<00:02:50.430> measured<00:02:50.700> it<00:02:51.000> and<00:02:51.180> it<00:02:51.389> only

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
actually I just measured it and it only

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.099 
actually I just measured it and it only
had<00:02:52.980> its<00:02:53.400> highest<00:02:53.760> point<00:02:54.000> which<00:02:54.299> is<00:02:54.510> just

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:55.109 
had its highest point which is just

00:02:55.109 --> 00:02:56.949 
had its highest point which is just
about<00:02:55.379> here<00:02:55.859> because<00:02:56.340> there's<00:02:56.549> going<00:02:56.730> to<00:02:56.790> be

00:02:56.949 --> 00:02:56.959 
about here because there's going to be

00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:59.809 
about here because there's going to be
its<00:02:57.959> electrical<00:02:58.439> cord<00:02:58.709> which<00:02:58.919> isn't<00:02:59.220> modeled

00:02:59.809 --> 00:02:59.819 
its electrical cord which isn't modeled

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:02.300 
its electrical cord which isn't modeled
on<00:02:59.909> this<00:03:00.150> Dremel<00:03:00.599> but<00:03:01.379> there's<00:03:01.769> an<00:03:01.889> electrical

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
on this Dremel but there's an electrical

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:03.559 
on this Dremel but there's an electrical
cord<00:03:02.459> and<00:03:02.549> stuff<00:03:02.760> like<00:03:02.909> that<00:03:03.090> to<00:03:03.299> actually

00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:03.569 
cord and stuff like that to actually

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:10.460 
cord and stuff like that to actually
power<00:03:03.750> it<00:03:05.780> so<00:03:06.780> is<00:03:07.019> about<00:03:07.169> here<00:03:07.769> and<00:03:09.470> this

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
power it so is about here and this

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:17.680 
power it so is about here and this
distance<00:03:10.919> is<00:03:11.310> about<00:03:12.060> three<00:03:12.540> inches<00:03:14.569> from<00:03:15.709> here

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:17.690 
distance is about three inches from here

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:24.289 
distance is about three inches from here
to<00:03:18.690> tip<00:03:20.569> three<00:03:21.569> and<00:03:21.659> a<00:03:21.720> half<00:03:21.840> ish<00:03:22.849> so<00:03:23.849> that's

00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:24.299 
to tip three and a half ish so that's

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:29.780 
to tip three and a half ish so that's
not<00:03:24.979> great<00:03:26.000> I<00:03:27.000> think<00:03:27.569> I<00:03:27.690> want<00:03:27.930> more<00:03:28.199> of<00:03:28.790> about

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
not great I think I want more of about

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:32.569 
not great I think I want more of about
six<00:03:30.209> inches<00:03:30.569> of<00:03:30.810> vertical<00:03:30.959> travel<00:03:31.620> so<00:03:32.280> I'll

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:32.579 
six inches of vertical travel so I'll

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:34.640 
six inches of vertical travel so I'll
probably<00:03:32.849> extend<00:03:33.659> this<00:03:33.840> piece<00:03:34.109> of<00:03:34.290> wood<00:03:34.440> up

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
probably extend this piece of wood up

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:37.430 
probably extend this piece of wood up
higher<00:03:34.949> so<00:03:35.340> this<00:03:36.329> thing<00:03:36.569> can<00:03:36.750> actually<00:03:36.780> move

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
higher so this thing can actually move

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:44.119 
higher so this thing can actually move
up<00:03:37.620> and<00:03:37.859> down<00:03:41.840> you<00:03:42.840> know<00:03:42.989> greater<00:03:43.620> distance

00:03:44.119 --> 00:03:44.129 
up and down you know greater distance

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:48.680 
up and down you know greater distance
but<00:03:46.250> but<00:03:47.250> anyways<00:03:47.639> that's<00:03:47.819> just<00:03:48.150> the<00:03:48.299> basic

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
but but anyways that's just the basic

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:55.309 
but but anyways that's just the basic
idea<00:03:49.409> I<00:03:51.019> hope<00:03:52.019> to<00:03:52.199> try<00:03:52.470> to<00:03:53.870> get<00:03:54.870> this<00:03:54.989> project

00:03:55.309 --> 00:03:55.319 
idea I hope to try to get this project

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:59.960 
idea I hope to try to get this project
actually<00:03:56.599> finalized<00:03:58.220> at<00:03:59.220> this<00:03:59.519> end<00:03:59.760> of<00:03:59.879> this

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970

method versus an all threaded rod method
I'm<00:04:35.080> pretty<00:04:35.620> positive<00:04:35.860> I<00:04:36.219> want<00:04:36.430> to<00:04:36.490> go<00:04:36.610> with

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:39.580 
the all threaded rod just because I feel

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:43.709 
the all threaded rod just because I feel
like<00:04:39.610> it's<00:04:39.909> going<00:04:40.060> to<00:04:40.090> be<00:04:40.210> a<00:04:40.240> lot<00:04:40.419> easier<00:04:42.719> but
