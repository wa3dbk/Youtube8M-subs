galaxy s2 of course what makes the razor

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.050 
galaxy s2 of course what makes the razor
stand<00:00:21.720> out<00:00:21.960> is<00:00:22.140> the<00:00:22.170> fact<00:00:22.320> that<00:00:22.590> it's<00:00:23.060> 7.1

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
stand out is the fact that it's 7.1

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.570 
stand out is the fact that it's 7.1
millimeters<00:00:24.990> in<00:00:25.289> thickness<00:00:25.430> which<00:00:26.430> is

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
millimeters in thickness which is

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.359 
millimeters in thickness which is
incredibly<00:00:27.300> thin<00:00:27.750> for<00:00:28.050> a<00:00:28.080> smartphone<00:00:28.740> and<00:00:28.949> at

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
incredibly thin for a smartphone and at

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.580 
incredibly thin for a smartphone and at
the<00:00:29.460> moment<00:00:29.699> nothing<00:00:30.150> comes<00:00:30.599> close<00:00:30.750> to<00:00:31.019> it<00:00:31.410> in

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
the moment nothing comes close to it in

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.370 
the moment nothing comes close to it in
terms<00:00:32.130> of<00:00:32.309> the<00:00:32.460> actual<00:00:32.579> thickness<00:00:33.170> so<00:00:34.170> I<00:00:34.200> just

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
terms of the actual thickness so I just

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:35.959 
terms of the actual thickness so I just
want<00:00:34.559> to<00:00:34.590> do<00:00:34.800> a<00:00:34.829> few<00:00:35.130> side-by-side

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
want to do a few side-by-side

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.500 
want to do a few side-by-side
compressors<00:00:36.630> so<00:00:36.780> let's<00:00:36.960> start<00:00:37.380> with<00:00:37.620> the

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:38.510 
compressors so let's start with the

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:41.180 
compressors so let's start with the
sensation<00:00:39.510> this<00:00:40.110> is<00:00:40.260> actually<00:00:40.590> a<00:00:40.649> whopping<00:00:41.070> 11

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
sensation this is actually a whopping 11

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.680 
sensation this is actually a whopping 11
point<00:00:41.700> 3<00:00:43.190> millimeters<00:00:44.190> in<00:00:44.430> thickness<00:00:44.690> so

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
point 3 millimeters in thickness so

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.369 
point 3 millimeters in thickness so
that's<00:00:45.930> the<00:00:46.230> two<00:00:46.710> devices<00:00:47.420> sort<00:00:48.420> of<00:00:48.480> side<00:00:49.050> by

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
that's the two devices sort of side by

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.299 
that's the two devices sort of side by
side<00:00:49.879> of<00:00:50.879> course<00:00:51.270> the<00:00:51.629> razor<00:00:52.289> at<00:00:52.530> the<00:00:52.649> top<00:00:52.890> does

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
side of course the razor at the top does

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:59.060 
side of course the razor at the top does
have<00:00:53.670> the<00:00:53.940> bold<00:00:54.180> for<00:00:54.480> the<00:00:54.570> camera<00:00:55.460> but<00:00:57.829> you<00:00:58.829> can

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
have the bold for the camera but you can

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:04.060 
have the bold for the camera but you can
see<00:00:59.370> the<00:00:59.579> differences<00:01:00.210> there<00:01:02.030> in<00:01:03.030> terms<00:01:03.359> of

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:04.070 
see the differences there in terms of

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:12.910 
see the differences there in terms of
the<00:01:05.070> thickness<00:01:06.080> really<00:01:07.080> is<00:01:09.979> quite<00:01:10.979> impressive

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:12.920 
the thickness really is quite impressive

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:18.499 
the thickness really is quite impressive
so<00:01:13.920> that's<00:01:14.520> the<00:01:15.140> HTC<00:01:16.549> Sensation<00:01:17.549> let's<00:01:18.210> bring

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
so that's the HTC Sensation let's bring

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:23.719 
so that's the HTC Sensation let's bring
in<00:01:18.659> the<00:01:19.020> galaxy<00:01:19.770> s2<00:01:20.299> which<00:01:21.299> is<00:01:22.520> probably<00:01:23.520> the

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
in the galaxy s2 which is probably the

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.490 
in the galaxy s2 which is probably the
most<00:01:23.759> popular<00:01:24.330> smartphone<00:01:24.840> at<00:01:24.960> the<00:01:25.020> moment

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
most popular smartphone at the moment

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.910 
most popular smartphone at the moment
and<00:01:25.619> the<00:01:26.130> most<00:01:26.310> comparable<00:01:26.820> in<00:01:27.150> terms<00:01:27.450> of

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920 
and the most comparable in terms of

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.340 
and the most comparable in terms of
specification<00:01:28.920> but<00:01:29.250> this<00:01:29.430> comes<00:01:29.700> in<00:01:29.850> at<00:01:30.020> 8.4<00:01:31.020> 9

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
specification but this comes in at 8.4 9

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.050 
specification but this comes in at 8.4 9
millimeters<00:01:32.070> in<00:01:32.340> thickness<00:01:32.630> so<00:01:34.220> not<00:01:35.220> an<00:01:35.400> awful

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
millimeters in thickness so not an awful

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:42.730 
millimeters in thickness so not an awful
lot<00:01:36.210> of<00:01:36.450> difference<00:01:39.020> but<00:01:41.659> difference

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:42.740 
lot of difference but difference

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:47.450 
lot of difference but difference
nonetheless<00:01:43.740> very<00:01:45.500> hard<00:01:46.500> to<00:01:46.860> tell<00:01:47.100> but<00:01:47.399> you

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
nonetheless very hard to tell but you

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:55.190 
nonetheless very hard to tell but you
can<00:01:47.850> see<00:01:48.450> that<00:01:48.720> the<00:01:49.049> razor<00:01:49.950> is<00:01:52.790> very<00:01:53.790> thin<00:01:54.360> that

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
can see that the razor is very thin that

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:01.459 
can see that the razor is very thin that
tagline<00:01:55.560> is<00:01:56.240> not<00:01:57.240> just<00:01:57.540> in<00:01:57.810> razor<00:01:58.500> thin<00:01:59.420> so<00:02:00.469> no

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
tagline is not just in razor thin so no

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.230 
tagline is not just in razor thin so no
it<00:02:01.590> is<00:02:01.710> but<00:02:02.040> in<00:02:02.159> terms<00:02:02.340> of<00:02:02.490> an<00:02:02.610> actual<00:02:02.729> overall

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
it is but in terms of an actual overall

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:10.400 
it is but in terms of an actual overall
profile<00:02:05.659> very<00:02:06.659> very<00:02:07.469> similar<00:02:08.270> but<00:02:09.270> the<00:02:10.170> razor

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
profile very very similar but the razor

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.410 
profile very very similar but the razor
is<00:02:10.739> just<00:02:11.270> fraction<00:02:12.270> bigger<00:02:12.540> butt

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
is just fraction bigger butt

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:15.510 
is just fraction bigger butt
not<00:02:13.540> an<00:02:13.690> awful<00:02:14.080> lot<00:02:14.230> in<00:02:14.590> it<00:02:14.860> so<00:02:15.099> that's<00:02:15.250> just<00:02:15.310> a

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:15.520 
not an awful lot in it so that's just a

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.930 
not an awful lot in it so that's just a
very<00:02:15.760> quick<00:02:16.170> hardware<00:02:17.170> comparison<00:02:17.890> in<00:02:18.880> terms

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
very quick hardware comparison in terms

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.600 
very quick hardware comparison in terms
of<00:02:19.330> size<00:02:19.569> the<00:02:19.989> razor<00:02:20.230> the<00:02:20.590> galaxy<00:02:20.980> st<00:02:21.130> and<00:02:21.520> the
