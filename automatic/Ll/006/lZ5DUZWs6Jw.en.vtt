00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:06.600
 Hello all fighters with you again file 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:08.490
 name and now I will tell you something 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.830
 very useful things are even needed 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.710
 to play it was more comfortable 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:16.020
 to kill everyone without problems 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.640
 In general, recently to sleep than released one 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.710
 wonderful beautiful thing that doesn't 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:23.220
 enough since the release fought for 4 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:25.560
 This is a high xavi zoom. 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.410
 That is, we explain something. 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.539
 settings there is such a thing as fov it 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.730
 field of view that is here indicated in 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:37.170
 degrees 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:38.969
 how much viewing angle do you have that is 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.500
 the more the better but not worth it 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.420
 overdo it as for some 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.550
 people may seem an image 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.860
 too stretched and 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.059
 as if you don't know what 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:50.399
 hyperspace fuck you fly away well 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.920
 General who as I am most 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:56.100
 like it in the battlefield 4 mosses with 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.230
 value table and entered wonderful 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.809
 just a function field of view open 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:04.070
 sight by default it is included I you 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:06.780
 I recommend it to their preferences their 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:09.510
 computer video settings its the same 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.979
 turn off that it will give you spend 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.900
 such a small experiment look 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:16.799
 do everything by default as he usually 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:22.860
 sometimes we put in 60 field of view include 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:24.689
 and how would you please have me now 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.210
 all like a horse on the racetrack I feel well 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:30.960
 In general, as you see, the zoom is not 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:36.930
 especially cool yes that is well almost 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:39.060
 does not bring anyone closer 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:42.360
 no even need to say so well there 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.820
 somewhere percent 10 go back in 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:50.700
 settings set as important as possible 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:53.670
 possible fov 120 please ohrenet 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.530
 review is just a tin like you on someone 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.939
 three monitors play all such yourself 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.479
 hut la trawl 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:03.090
 gamer and noise as if all sucks 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:05.630
 feel the difference that is there 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:09.060
 was the goal 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:12.540
 in the floor of the screen before then here at all 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:14.580
 fuck you aiming though there how much I 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.350
 protection how much we have a distance of 18 meters 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:19.730
 17 meters from here but this stuff here 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:23.640
 that's how you see that is 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:24.930
 really harder to get here 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.830
 there are fellow daysy 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:30.840
 This is understood and made this very function 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:33.870
 which is called our field of view and and 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:40.010
 turn off and you have the following 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:43.020
 hair smooth 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:45.210
 Well, as if yes a very useful feature 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:46.500
 this we must turn off especially 

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:46.980
 if you use collimator 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.130
 sights 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:52.020
 all there magnifier and other crap more 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:53.850
 one prikolyuha guys are not worth it 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:57.290
 overdo the general with the sight field 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:59.310
 principle not only in the plans and 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:01.830
 year quickness of comfort up 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:03.630
 his and because of drawing again 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:08.130
 let's get right here with you 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:09.690
 There are very few tests. 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:12.750
 takes time in general you see here 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:14.870
 the bedside can see basically a lot of bull 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:20.700
 Here we focus on this barrel 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:24.600
 running back the kidneys are no longer visible correctly 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:27.080
 here it is here and there he is and all the tank is gone 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.080
 basically 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:34.459
 like that that is at such a distance there 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:39.890
 barrel drawn correctly 

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:43.580
 correctly turn on fov but legs where there 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:45.409
 see how much I need a barrel 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:48.700
 go ahead to the same one . check 

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:48.700
 fix draws and 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:01.209
 ahrenet yes that is the middle of feel the 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:04.150
 the difference is called that is, we retreat 

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:05.830
 to the same point we have used that 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:10.299
 the most feature that I recommended 

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:11.680
 at the very beginning and see that is with this 

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:14.049
 functions in principle snuff 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:14.950
 drawn as you see shoot 

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:16.840
 really easier 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:20.410
 this feature works absolutely everything 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:22.030
 the trunks in the battlefield and just like zoom 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:24.190
 and on 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:25.860
 in principle collimator sight so on 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:27.490
 mechanically on absolutely everything 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:29.680
 use include 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:31.930
 once again showing make field of view 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:35.919
 turn off and set favorable for 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:38.290
 yourself fov values â€‹â€‹well and basically everything with 

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:43.290
 you will be william guide very soon 

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:43.290
 a few days later bye
