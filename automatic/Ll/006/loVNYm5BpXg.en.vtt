 turned water is just passing a cardboard and ready the book continues 

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:13.970
 is thus published in the travelogue by the nature of the

 family miller 

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:18.290
 and the computer didactic books of the paula souza center 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:23.050
 which maintains technical colleges that colleges of technology for 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:24.839
 training of professionals 

00:00:24.839 --> 00:00:30.179
 in the state of s達o paulo the novelty is a branch in which they were arrested the 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.329
 recycled synthetic paper 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:35.450
 produced from the end use of plastic 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.090
 kill it on friday 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.880
 in the stance 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:43.620
 fun and art 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.710
 with that matter 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.710
 recycle 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:55.670
 the recycling process 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:57.810
 the manufacturers 

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:00.810
 recycle 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.670
 recycling 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.550
 the company that produces the paper stays in votorantim 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:12.070
 about 100 kilometers from s達o paulo 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:15.580
 we follow a simulation because the production line 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.170
 still does not run regularly soup 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.370
 a order 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:23.470
 but the process is practically the same as the plastic film 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.360
 these announcements that in the case of synthetic paper are made from 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:29.710
 used plastic 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:31.180
 the elderly widespread 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:33.810
 the new product was manufactured 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.820
 we have to get out of the dumps 85 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:40.820
 queiroz for every 100 is - said wen 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.370
 in May 2009 the reporter who was at the university of s達o carlos 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:50.509
 one of the partners in the research to develop paper 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:55.320
 to the transformation of the packaging then I think that sin and 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.810
 cast in high temperature 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.749
 which later became this state that had 

00:02:00.749 --> 00:02:04.040
 which gives rise to recycled synthetic paper 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.260
 Sara had no one 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:07.810
 the team coordinator 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:10.019
 talked about his qualities 

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:15.420
 is a greater durability than I until the conventional settlement resistance 

00:02:15.419 --> 00:02:18.419
 greater also 

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:22.009
 - bigger 

00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:26.459
 it is good some compositions the quality of the floor 

00:02:27.059 --> 00:02:28.709
 or now 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:30.269
 the cost of each time 

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:34.629
 better the products used are the purposes 

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:36.569
 this is the tape and for the ie 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:40.909
 in s達o paulo are being printed from the paula center books 

00:02:40.909 --> 00:02:46.269
 souza the printing of synthetic paper give more work because the ink takes 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:51.219
 more to dry the advantage is in the economy the athletic has with the increase 

00:02:51.219 --> 00:02:53.339
 of 60% colony 

00:02:53.339 --> 00:02:58.009
 why reynders and both had the same amount of tiradentes

 fernando de almeida vice president of the padre anchieta foundation who 

00:03:02.179 --> 00:03:03.160
 tv culture 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:07.840
 coordinates the core education of the foundation he explains why he bet 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.720
 new product to print the textbooks first because 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:14.899
 these students are graduating as a citizen 

00:03:14.899 --> 00:03:16.419
 and he realizes 

00:03:16.419 --> 00:03:20.579
 that the issue of recycling the issue of the river's commitment to the environment and 

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:25.389
 not something far away luana did not find anything either in greenland 

00:03:26.409 --> 00:03:29.019
 I think it brings you close. 

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:32.109
 in it, it commits itself more to that besides 

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:35.109
 symbolically the fact of being paper 

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:36.749
 recyclable 

00:03:36.749 --> 00:03:45.429
 hence the idea that the role of recycling port 

00:03:45.429 --> 00:03:48.429
