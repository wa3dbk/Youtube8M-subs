00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:03.649 

okay<00:00:01.680> so<00:00:02.129> I'm<00:00:02.850> running<00:00:02.939> out<00:00:03.149> of<00:00:03.240> topics<00:00:03.449> to

00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:03.659 
okay so I'm running out of topics to

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:04.970 
okay so I'm running out of topics to
make<00:00:03.810> a<00:00:03.840> big<00:00:04.049> tutorial<00:00:04.589> son

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:04.980 
make a big tutorial son

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:06.829 
make a big tutorial son
I<00:00:05.009> think<00:00:05.700> instead<00:00:05.819> from<00:00:06.150> now<00:00:06.270> on<00:00:06.420> I'll<00:00:06.540> start

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
I think instead from now on I'll start

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:08.980 
I think instead from now on I'll start
making<00:00:06.960> mini<00:00:07.319> tutorials<00:00:07.859> on<00:00:08.069> various<00:00:08.519> topics

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:08.990 
making mini tutorials on various topics

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:10.879 
making mini tutorials on various topics
there<00:00:09.990> are<00:00:10.050> a<00:00:10.110> couple<00:00:10.230> of<00:00:10.349> things<00:00:10.530> that<00:00:10.769> don't

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
there are a couple of things that don't

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:12.320 
there are a couple of things that don't
really<00:00:11.040> deserve<00:00:11.250> our<00:00:11.610> whole<00:00:11.759> tutorial<00:00:12.210> just

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
really deserve our whole tutorial just

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.209 
really deserve our whole tutorial just
by<00:00:12.480> themselves<00:00:12.960> but<00:00:13.440> are<00:00:13.620> still<00:00:13.799> pretty<00:00:14.009> cool

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
by themselves but are still pretty cool

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.160 
by themselves but are still pretty cool
and<00:00:14.519> this<00:00:14.940> series<00:00:15.210> of<00:00:15.420> videos<00:00:15.719> will<00:00:15.900> be<00:00:15.929> going

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
and this series of videos will be going

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.910 
and this series of videos will be going
through<00:00:16.289> those<00:00:16.560> one<00:00:16.859> by<00:00:16.920> one<00:00:17.160> basically

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:18.920 
through those one by one basically

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:21.170 
through those one by one basically
okay<00:00:19.920> this<00:00:20.100> time<00:00:20.130> I'll<00:00:20.430> show<00:00:20.460> you<00:00:20.670> some<00:00:20.939> epic

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
okay this time I'll show you some epic

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:22.400 
okay this time I'll show you some epic
levels<00:00:21.449> that<00:00:21.539> you<00:00:21.630> should<00:00:21.779> definitely<00:00:22.260> know

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
levels that you should definitely know

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.800 
levels that you should definitely know
about<00:00:22.619> now<00:00:23.519> something<00:00:23.850> will<00:00:24.060> possibly<00:00:24.480> find

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
about now something will possibly find

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.019 
about now something will possibly find
this<00:00:24.869> too<00:00:25.170> easy<00:00:25.350> but<00:00:26.039> my<00:00:26.250> audience<00:00:26.640> is<00:00:26.789> very

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
this too easy but my audience is very

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:27.529 
this too easy but my audience is very
broad

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
broad

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.300 
broad
so<00:00:27.720> there'll<00:00:28.289> probably<00:00:28.410> be<00:00:28.740> a<00:00:28.830> couple<00:00:28.890> of<00:00:29.160> you

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
so there'll probably be a couple of you

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.060 
so there'll probably be a couple of you
that<00:00:29.340> can<00:00:29.640> learn<00:00:29.789> from<00:00:29.970> this<00:00:30.260> so<00:00:31.260> one<00:00:31.859> thing

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
that can learn from this so one thing

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.130 
that can learn from this so one thing
that<00:00:32.099> happens<00:00:32.489> a<00:00:32.550> lot<00:00:32.579> during<00:00:32.910> solving<00:00:33.630> f2l<00:00:33.960> is

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
that happens a lot during solving f2l is

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.569 
that happens a lot during solving f2l is
that<00:00:34.500> you<00:00:34.590> have<00:00:34.680> a<00:00:34.710> corner<00:00:35.070> snap<00:00:35.309> in<00:00:35.489> the

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
that you have a corner snap in the

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.610 
that you have a corner snap in the
bottom<00:00:35.880> layer<00:00:36.059> and<00:00:36.239> it's<00:00:36.690> edge<00:00:36.870> as<00:00:37.110> summer<00:00:37.440> on

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
bottom layer and it's edge as summer on

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.740 
bottom layer and it's edge as summer on
the<00:00:37.710> top<00:00:37.920> so<00:00:38.790> like<00:00:38.940> in<00:00:39.059> this<00:00:39.120> case<00:00:39.300> we<00:00:39.480> have<00:00:39.570> the

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
the top so like in this case we have the

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.869 
the top so like in this case we have the
orange<00:00:40.170> balloon<00:00:40.320> on<00:00:40.829> the<00:00:40.920> bottom<00:00:41.219> here<00:00:41.430> the

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
orange balloon on the bottom here the

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.479 
orange balloon on the bottom here the
edges<00:00:42.120> on<00:00:42.239> top<00:00:42.450> and<00:00:42.690> there<00:00:43.469> are<00:00:43.530> basically<00:00:43.860> you

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
edges on top and there are basically you

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:45.819 
edges on top and there are basically you
basically<00:00:44.760> need<00:00:44.910> to<00:00:45.090> pair<00:00:45.270> them<00:00:45.390> up<00:00:45.510> somehow

00:00:45.819 --> 00:00:45.829 
basically need to pair them up somehow

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:50.900 
basically need to pair them up somehow
now<00:00:46.829> what<00:00:47.730> I<00:00:47.760> do<00:00:47.879> is<00:00:47.969> always<00:00:48.329> put<00:00:48.920> the<00:00:49.920> edge<00:00:50.039> on

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
now what I do is always put the edge on

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.400 
now what I do is always put the edge on
the<00:00:51.090> right<00:00:51.239> face<00:00:51.510> together<00:00:51.930> with<00:00:52.050> the<00:00:52.140> corner

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
the right face together with the corner

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.529 
the right face together with the corner
and<00:00:52.559> I<00:00:52.860> check<00:00:53.160> these<00:00:53.460> colors<00:00:53.820> here<00:00:53.969> on<00:00:54.480> the

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
and I check these colors here on the

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.600 
and I check these colors here on the
right<00:00:54.660> face<00:00:54.840> so<00:00:55.260> orange<00:00:55.800> for<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:56.160> corner<00:00:56.460> and

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
right face so orange for the corner and

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.479 
right face so orange for the corner and
blue<00:00:57.570> for<00:00:57.780> the<00:00:57.840> edge<00:00:57.960> now<00:00:58.890> if<00:00:59.010> the<00:00:59.100> colors<00:00:59.340> are

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
blue for the edge now if the colors are

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:00.680 
blue for the edge now if the colors are
different<00:00:59.579> then<00:00:59.940> this<00:01:00.059> is<00:01:00.180> the<00:01:00.300> good<00:01:00.480> case

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
different then this is the good case

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.720 
different then this is the good case
because<00:01:01.199> all<00:01:01.710> I<00:01:01.770> need<00:01:02.070> to<00:01:02.190> do<00:01:02.280> to<00:01:02.430> pair<00:01:02.609> that

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
because all I need to do to pair that

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.789 
because all I need to do to pair that
these<00:01:03.000> two<00:01:03.270> is<00:01:03.559> are<00:01:04.559> u<00:01:05.309> prime<00:01:05.610> R<00:01:05.939> prime<00:01:06.000> and

00:01:06.789 --> 00:01:06.799 
these two is are u prime R prime and

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:12.920 
these two is are u prime R prime and
then<00:01:07.799> you<00:01:07.950> can<00:01:08.130> insert<00:01:08.490> it<00:01:08.640> very<00:01:08.820> quickly<00:01:11.930> now

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
then you can insert it very quickly now

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.450 
then you can insert it very quickly now
the<00:01:12.990> more<00:01:13.170> interesting<00:01:13.560> cases<00:01:13.740> when<00:01:14.040> the<00:01:14.189> two

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
the more interesting cases when the two

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.670 
the more interesting cases when the two
colors<00:01:14.820> on<00:01:15.090> the<00:01:15.299> right<00:01:15.330> are<00:01:15.900> the<00:01:15.930> same<00:01:16.049> so<00:01:16.530> like

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
colors on the right are the same so like

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.980 
colors on the right are the same so like
in<00:01:16.799> this<00:01:16.890> case<00:01:17.070> orange<00:01:17.430> and<00:01:17.549> orange<00:01:17.869> so<00:01:18.869> in

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
in this case orange and orange so in

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.210 
in this case orange and orange so in
this<00:01:19.049> case<00:01:19.229> you<00:01:19.350> can't<00:01:19.560> just<00:01:19.710> do<00:01:19.799> what<00:01:19.950> we<00:01:20.040> did

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
this case you can't just do what we did

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.160 
this case you can't just do what we did
are<00:01:20.520> you<00:01:20.790> prime<00:01:21.030> R<00:01:21.150> prime<00:01:21.180> because<00:01:22.020> obviously

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
are you prime R prime because obviously

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.920 
are you prime R prime because obviously
the<00:01:22.560> edge<00:01:22.680> will<00:01:22.890> be<00:01:22.920> flipped<00:01:23.450> so<00:01:24.450> my<00:01:24.600> favorite

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
the edge will be flipped so my favorite

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.570 
the edge will be flipped so my favorite
way<00:01:25.020> to<00:01:25.049> handle<00:01:25.320> this<00:01:25.650> if<00:01:25.890> I<00:01:26.070> run<00:01:26.250> into<00:01:26.369> the

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
way to handle this if I run into the

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.859 
way to handle this if I run into the
case<00:01:26.759> like<00:01:26.970> this<00:01:27.380> is<00:01:28.380> to<00:01:28.680> do<00:01:28.799> u<00:01:29.490> prime<00:01:29.729> and<00:01:29.970> then

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
case like this is to do u prime and then

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.770 
case like this is to do u prime and then
do<00:01:31.140> the<00:01:31.500> ru<00:01:31.829> prime<00:01:32.070> R<00:01:32.250> prime<00:01:32.280> R<00:01:32.700> u<00:01:33.060> prime<00:01:33.329> apart

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
do the ru prime R prime R u prime apart

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.539 
do the ru prime R prime R u prime apart
from<00:01:33.869> you<00:01:34.020> because<00:01:34.770> then<00:01:35.040> we'll<00:01:35.159> set<00:01:35.340> it<00:01:35.369> up

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
from you because then we'll set it up

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:41.510 
from you because then we'll set it up
and<00:01:35.759> you<00:01:36.270> can<00:01:36.420> just<00:01:36.479> insert<00:01:37.170> it<00:01:37.320> quickly<00:01:39.079> so<00:01:40.520> so

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
and you can just insert it quickly so so

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.100 
and you can just insert it quickly so so
I'm<00:01:41.640> reversing<00:01:42.000> the<00:01:42.270> case<00:01:42.540> so<00:01:42.869> we<00:01:42.930> have<00:01:43.049> the

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
I'm reversing the case so we have the

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.859 
I'm reversing the case so we have the
same<00:01:43.290> case<00:01:43.470> so<00:01:44.189> it<00:01:44.280> was<00:01:44.430> a<00:01:44.460> u<00:01:44.970> prime<00:01:45.210> to<00:01:45.570> put<00:01:45.750> the

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
same case so it was a u prime to put the

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.109 
same case so it was a u prime to put the
edge<00:01:45.990> to<00:01:46.110> the<00:01:46.200> back<00:01:46.409> and<00:01:46.649> then<00:01:47.159> are<00:01:47.490> you<00:01:47.909> part

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
edge to the back and then are you part

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.179 
edge to the back and then are you part
of<00:01:48.149> our<00:01:48.299> prime<00:01:48.570> and<00:01:48.869> then<00:01:49.590> you<00:01:49.710> can<00:01:49.860> insert

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
of our prime and then you can insert

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:53.569 
of our prime and then you can insert
them<00:01:50.310> easily<00:01:51.500> now<00:01:52.500> if<00:01:52.770> I<00:01:52.890> run<00:01:53.040> into<00:01:53.159> the<00:01:53.369> case

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
them easily now if I run into the case

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:56.270 
them easily now if I run into the case
like<00:01:53.880> this<00:01:54.350> then<00:01:55.350> I<00:01:55.439> can<00:01:55.590> use<00:01:55.710> my<00:01:55.860> left<00:01:56.009> hand<00:01:56.130> to

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
like this then I can use my left hand to

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.889 
like this then I can use my left hand to
do<00:01:56.399> it<00:01:56.490> much<00:01:56.640> quicker<00:01:56.670> I<00:01:57.090> don't<00:01:57.329> need<00:01:57.450> a<00:01:57.479> cube

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
do it much quicker I don't need a cube

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.440 
do it much quicker I don't need a cube
rotation<00:01:58.290> and<00:01:58.469> the<00:01:59.340> way<00:01:59.430> to<00:01:59.490> do<00:01:59.640> it<00:01:59.759> is<00:01:59.909> to<00:02:00.119> pair

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
rotation and the way to do it is to pair

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.569 
rotation and the way to do it is to pair
it<00:02:00.479> up<00:02:00.600> with<00:02:00.659> the<00:02:00.780> center<00:02:01.020> the<00:02:01.320> edge<00:02:01.469> so<00:02:02.369> here

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
it up with the center the edge so here

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:06.139 
it up with the center the edge so here
and<00:02:02.759> then<00:02:03.450> u<00:02:03.689> L<00:02:03.960> prime<00:02:04.290> u<00:02:04.439> prime<00:02:04.500> L<00:02:04.860> and<00:02:05.149> then

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
and then u L prime u prime L and then

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.029 
and then u L prime u prime L and then
you're<00:02:06.360> set<00:02:06.570> up<00:02:06.600> so<00:02:07.290> there<00:02:07.500> left<00:02:07.710> hand<00:02:07.920> that's

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
you're set up so there left hand that's

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.809 
you're set up so there left hand that's
much<00:02:08.250> quicker

00:02:09.809 --> 00:02:09.819 
much quicker

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:11.709 
much quicker
okay<00:02:10.819> so<00:02:10.909> those<00:02:11.090> are<00:02:11.239> pretty<00:02:11.329> much<00:02:11.480> the<00:02:11.689> best

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:11.719 
okay so those are pretty much the best

00:02:11.719 --> 00:02:15.009 
okay so those are pretty much the best
ways<00:02:12.109> to<00:02:12.140> liberate<00:02:13.099> a<00:02:13.310> corner<00:02:13.700> and<00:02:13.900> send<00:02:14.900> out

00:02:15.009 --> 00:02:15.019 
ways to liberate a corner and send out

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:16.539 
ways to liberate a corner and send out
for<00:02:15.109> an<00:02:15.230> insertion<00:02:15.499> if<00:02:15.859> the<00:02:16.040> corner<00:02:16.310> is<00:02:16.370> stuck

00:02:16.539 --> 00:02:16.549 
for an insertion if the corner is stuck

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:18.429 
for an insertion if the corner is stuck
on<00:02:16.639> the<00:02:16.700> bottom<00:02:16.969> layer<00:02:17.060> now<00:02:18.019> completely

00:02:18.429 --> 00:02:18.439 
on the bottom layer now completely

00:02:18.439 --> 00:02:20.080 
on the bottom layer now completely
unrelated<00:02:18.889> to<00:02:19.099> that<00:02:19.129> I'm<00:02:19.489> going<00:02:19.819> to<00:02:19.909> show<00:02:20.030> you

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
unrelated to that I'm going to show you

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:22.479 
unrelated to that I'm going to show you
one<00:02:20.269> more<00:02:20.299> cool<00:02:20.599> thing<00:02:20.680> it's<00:02:21.680> you<00:02:22.280> know<00:02:22.370> how

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:22.489 
one more cool thing it's you know how

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:23.739 
one more cool thing it's you know how
are<00:02:22.549> you<00:02:22.609> trying<00:02:22.849> to<00:02:22.969> we're<00:02:23.180> always<00:02:23.299> trying<00:02:23.540> to

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:23.749 
are you trying to we're always trying to

00:02:23.749 --> 00:02:29.229 
are you trying to we're always trying to
save<00:02:24.439> up<00:02:25.719> cube<00:02:26.719> rotations<00:02:27.109> and<00:02:27.670> so<00:02:28.670> set<00:02:29.060> up<00:02:29.150> the

00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:29.239 
save up cube rotations and so set up the

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:33.160 
save up cube rotations and so set up the
case<00:02:29.420> doing<00:02:29.629> F<00:02:29.870> prime<00:02:30.139> u<00:02:30.379> prime<00:02:30.409> F<00:02:31.129> V<00:02:31.879> Prime<00:02:32.180> so

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170 
case doing F prime u prime F V Prime so

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:34.390 
case doing F prime u prime F V Prime so
let's<00:02:33.349> say<00:02:33.439> you're<00:02:33.590> solving<00:02:33.829> up<00:02:34.040> to<00:02:34.129> oil<00:02:34.280> and

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
let's say you're solving up to oil and

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.399 
let's say you're solving up to oil and
you<00:02:34.549> run<00:02:34.730> into<00:02:34.819> this<00:02:35.000> case<00:02:35.239> you<00:02:35.989> know<00:02:36.049> yet<00:02:36.200> you

00:02:36.399 --> 00:02:36.409 
you run into this case you know yet you

00:02:36.409 --> 00:02:38.170 
you run into this case you know yet you
make<00:02:36.590> a<00:02:36.620> pair<00:02:36.889> somehow<00:02:37.370> and<00:02:37.609> now<00:02:37.909> you<00:02:37.969> want<00:02:38.150> to

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
make a pair somehow and now you want to

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:41.080 
make a pair somehow and now you want to
insert<00:02:38.419> it<00:02:38.569> here<00:02:38.599> but<00:02:39.019> you<00:02:39.859> know<00:02:39.980> you<00:02:40.040> can't<00:02:40.340> do

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
insert it here but you know you can't do

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:43.300 
insert it here but you know you can't do
it<00:02:41.209> without<00:02:41.299> a<00:02:41.480> key<00:02:41.689> rotation<00:02:42.169> right<00:02:42.319> like<00:02:43.189> you

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
it without a key rotation right like you

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:46.959 
it without a key rotation right like you
have<00:02:43.400> to<00:02:43.489> rotate<00:02:44.000> to<00:02:44.480> insert<00:02:44.870> it<00:02:45.639> so<00:02:46.639> actually

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:46.969 
have to rotate to insert it so actually

00:02:46.969 --> 00:02:49.140 
have to rotate to insert it so actually
you<00:02:47.120> don't<00:02:47.269> need<00:02:47.599> to<00:02:47.840> rotate<00:02:48.049> to<00:02:48.500> insert<00:02:48.799> it

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
you don't need to rotate to insert it

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:56.470 
you don't need to rotate to insert it
put<00:02:50.150> the<00:02:50.269> pair<00:02:50.480> there<00:02:50.719> and<00:02:51.040> do<00:02:52.510> that<00:02:55.329> so<00:02:56.329> what

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
put the pair there and do that so what

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.300 
put the pair there and do that so what
did<00:02:56.599> I<00:02:56.689> do<00:02:56.840> let's<00:02:57.139> do<00:02:57.260> it<00:02:57.349> in<00:02:57.469> I<00:02:57.680> prime<00:02:58.099> u<00:02:58.250> prime

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310 
did I do let's do it in I prime u prime

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:06.250 
did I do let's do it in I prime u prime
u<00:02:58.939> prime<00:03:00.010> so<00:03:01.449> it's<00:03:02.449> this<00:03:03.189> put<00:03:04.189> it<00:03:04.280> there<00:03:04.659> and<00:03:05.659> as

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260 
u prime so it's this put it there and as

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:12.309 
u prime so it's this put it there and as
you<00:03:06.379> go<00:03:06.500> down<00:03:06.739> click<00:03:07.480> and<00:03:08.480> go<00:03:08.599> down<00:03:11.260> all<00:03:12.260> the

you go down click and go down all the

you go down click and go down all the

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810 
way again I don't even know what

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:19.509 
way again I don't even know what

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:27.189 

anyway<00:03:26.090> but<00:03:26.479> I<00:03:26.509> think<00:03:26.750> I<00:03:26.810> thought<00:03:27.019> it<00:03:27.079> was

anyway but I think I thought it was

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:29.170 
anyway but I think I thought it was
pretty<00:03:27.290> cool<00:03:27.530> I<00:03:28.250> don't<00:03:28.549> want<00:03:28.819> to<00:03:28.879> use<00:03:28.970> it<00:03:29.090> in

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:29.180 
pretty cool I don't want to use it in

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:31.719 
pretty cool I don't want to use it in
practice<00:03:29.359> too<00:03:29.720> much<00:03:29.900> but<00:03:30.169> I<00:03:30.409> guess<00:03:31.370> I<00:03:31.489> should

00:03:31.719 --> 00:03:31.729 
practice too much but I guess I should

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:35.949 
practice too much but I guess I should
maybe<00:03:31.879> it's<00:03:32.239> pretty<00:03:34.509> similarly<00:03:35.509> one<00:03:35.810> more

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:35.959 
maybe it's pretty similarly one more

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:39.249 
maybe it's pretty similarly one more
awkward<00:03:36.319> insertion<00:03:36.829> is<00:03:36.949> to<00:03:37.579> set<00:03:37.790> it<00:03:37.879> up<00:03:37.939> to<00:03:38.120> a<00:03:38.259> B

00:03:39.249 --> 00:03:39.259 
awkward insertion is to set it up to a B

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:41.800 
awkward insertion is to set it up to a B

this<00:03:42.709> is<00:03:42.829> a<00:03:42.859> really<00:03:43.099> awkward<00:03:43.549> in<00:03:44.030> surfing

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:44.359 
this is a really awkward in surfing

00:03:44.359 --> 00:03:45.789 
this is a really awkward in surfing
you've<00:03:44.479> just<00:03:44.659> made<00:03:44.780> a<00:03:44.840> pair<00:03:45.109> and<00:03:45.319> you<00:03:45.590> want<00:03:45.739> to

00:03:45.789 --> 00:03:45.799 
you've just made a pair and you want to

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:47.649 
you've just made a pair and you want to
insert<00:03:46.009> it<00:03:46.159> there<00:03:46.189> but<00:03:46.790> you<00:03:47.000> can't<00:03:47.239> do<00:03:47.419> it<00:03:47.509> from

00:03:47.649 --> 00:03:47.659 
insert it there but you can't do it from

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:50.649 
insert it there but you can't do it from
this<00:03:47.780> angle<00:03:47.919> you<00:03:48.919> have<00:03:48.949> to<00:03:49.189> rotate<00:03:49.729> to<00:03:50.299> insert

00:03:50.649 --> 00:03:50.659 
this angle you have to rotate to insert

00:03:50.659 --> 00:03:52.809 
this angle you have to rotate to insert
it<00:03:51.009> well<00:03:52.009> actually<00:03:52.129> you<00:03:52.340> don't<00:03:52.519> need<00:03:52.669> to

00:03:52.809 --> 00:03:52.819 
it well actually you don't need to

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:57.849 
it well actually you don't need to
rotate<00:03:53.859> so<00:03:55.239> put<00:03:56.239> the<00:03:56.299> pair<00:03:56.449> here<00:03:56.659> it<00:03:57.620> needs<00:03:57.799> to

00:03:57.849 --> 00:03:57.859 
rotate so put the pair here it needs to

00:03:57.859 --> 00:04:03.070 
rotate so put the pair here it needs to
go<00:03:57.979> there<00:03:58.599> you<00:03:59.599> do<00:03:59.829> r2

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:03.080 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:09.070 

and<00:04:03.340> then<00:04:04.340> our<00:04:04.670> F<00:04:05.480> prime<00:04:05.870> R<00:04:06.080> and<00:04:07.480> I<00:04:08.480> can't<00:04:08.870> do

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:09.080 
and then our F prime R and I can't do

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:10.750 
and then our F prime R and I can't do
this<00:04:09.230> one<00:04:09.530> as<00:04:09.710> fast<00:04:10.040> and<00:04:10.340> I'm<00:04:10.430> not<00:04:10.550> sure<00:04:10.700> if

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:10.760 
this one as fast and I'm not sure if

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:12.610 
this one as fast and I'm not sure if
it's<00:04:10.910> possible<00:04:11.060> but<00:04:11.900> I<00:04:11.960> I<00:04:12.230> thought<00:04:12.410> it<00:04:12.500> was

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:12.620 
it's possible but I I thought it was

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:14.380 
it's possible but I I thought it was
pretty<00:04:12.740> cool<00:04:12.980> that<00:04:13.040> you<00:04:13.250> can<00:04:13.370> still<00:04:13.670> insert<00:04:14.210> it

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:14.390 
pretty cool that you can still insert it

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:16.900 
pretty cool that you can still insert it
without<00:04:14.630> doing<00:04:15.200> the<00:04:15.410> cube<00:04:15.590> assertion<00:04:16.100> without

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:16.910 
without doing the cube assertion without

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:21.340 
without doing the cube assertion without
doing<00:04:17.299> a<00:04:17.390> cube<00:04:17.630> rotation<00:04:17.989> so<00:04:20.290> something<00:04:21.290> like

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:21.350 
doing a cube rotation so something like

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:29.290 
doing a cube rotation so something like
that<00:04:27.070> yeah<00:04:28.070> I<00:04:28.100> can't<00:04:28.460> do<00:04:28.550> it<00:04:28.670> because<00:04:28.730> I<00:04:28.910> don't

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:29.300 
that yeah I can't do it because I don't

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:31.750 
that yeah I can't do it because I don't
never<00:04:29.560> do<00:04:30.560> it<00:04:30.680> but<00:04:30.890> I<00:04:31.100> think<00:04:31.190> it's<00:04:31.430> pretty<00:04:31.610> cool

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:31.760 
never do it but I think it's pretty cool

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:34.930 
never do it but I think it's pretty cool
maybe<00:04:31.970> someone<00:04:32.240> can<00:04:32.360> master<00:04:32.750> it<00:04:32.840> and<00:04:33.340> what<00:04:34.340> if

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:34.940 
maybe someone can master it and what if

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:38.440 
maybe someone can master it and what if
someone<00:04:35.240> can<00:04:35.390> master<00:04:35.690> it<00:04:35.780> in<00:04:37.120> and<00:04:38.120> do<00:04:38.300> much

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:38.450 
someone can master it in and do much

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:41.650 
someone can master it in and do much
better<00:04:38.660> than<00:04:38.810> me<00:04:38.930> so<00:04:39.790> yeah<00:04:40.790> pretty<00:04:41.120> random<00:04:41.510> tip

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:41.660 
better than me so yeah pretty random tip

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:45.640 
better than me so yeah pretty random tip
stuff<00:04:43.570> anyway<00:04:44.570> that's<00:04:45.080> it<00:04:45.170> for<00:04:45.320> now

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:45.650 
stuff anyway that's it for now

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:48.340 
stuff anyway that's it for now
I'll<00:04:46.040> see<00:04:46.160> you<00:04:46.220> later
