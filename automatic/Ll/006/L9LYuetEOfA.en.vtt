00:01:58.439 --> 00:01:59.990 
scanning it's a great great slicer fits
well<00:01:58.619> in<00:01:58.710> the<00:01:58.740> hand<00:01:58.799> as<00:01:59.130> I<00:01:59.310> said<00:01:59.490> before<00:01:59.640> it's<00:01:59.939> a

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
well in the hand as I said before it's a

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.359 
well in the hand as I said before it's a
little<00:02:00.240> thinner<00:02:00.479> than<00:02:00.719> the<00:02:01.110> pterosaur<00:02:02.100> as<00:02:02.250> you

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
little thinner than the pterosaur as you

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.670 
little thinner than the pterosaur as you
can<00:02:02.520> see<00:02:02.729> this<00:02:03.450> probably<00:02:03.810> runs<00:02:03.990> out<00:02:04.200> just

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
can see this probably runs out just

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.109 
can see this probably runs out just
based<00:02:04.860> on<00:02:04.979> the<00:02:05.070> eyeball<00:02:05.280> maybe<00:02:05.490> 7/8<00:02:05.939> of<00:02:06.030> an

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:08.739 
inch I shade more this is

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:11.940 
inch I shade more this is
more<00:02:09.099> 510<00:02:09.700> so<00:02:10.659> it's<00:02:10.869> definitely<00:02:11.230> got<00:02:11.379> a<00:02:11.409> bit<00:02:11.859> of

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
more 510 so it's definitely got a bit of

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:13.770 
more 510 so it's definitely got a bit of
thickness<00:02:12.129> on<00:02:12.400> the<00:02:12.489> 510<00:02:12.939> got<00:02:13.540> a<00:02:13.569> little

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
thickness on the 510 got a little

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.349 
thickness on the 510 got a little
certainly<00:02:14.409> more<00:02:14.620> circumference<00:02:15.180> than<00:02:16.180> it

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:16.359 
certainly more circumference than it

00:02:16.359 --> 00:02:19.170 
certainly more circumference than it
does<00:02:16.569> the<00:02:17.349> profile<00:02:17.829> it's<00:02:18.459> a<00:02:18.760> bit<00:02:18.909> different

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
does the profile it's a bit different

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.330 
does the profile it's a bit different
different<00:02:19.450> towards<00:02:19.659> the<00:02:19.750> butt<00:02:19.930> and<00:02:20.170> a<00:02:21.040> little

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
different towards the butt and a little

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.009 
different towards the butt and a little
wider<00:02:21.579> up<00:02:21.819> here<00:02:22.030> at<00:02:22.120> the<00:02:22.239> first<00:02:22.480> finger<00:02:22.840> and

00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:23.019 
wider up here at the first finger and

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:27.420 
wider up here at the first finger and
the<00:02:23.650> blades<00:02:23.950> a<00:02:24.099> bit<00:02:24.250> wider<00:02:25.889> by<00:02:26.889> about<00:02:27.159> that

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
the blades a bit wider by about that

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.250 
the blades a bit wider by about that
much<00:02:27.639> but<00:02:27.670> I'm<00:02:28.000> out<00:02:28.120> the<00:02:28.629> width<00:02:28.870> of<00:02:28.930> the<00:02:29.049> bevel

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
much but I'm out the width of the bevel

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.429 
much but I'm out the width of the bevel
there<00:02:29.500> which<00:02:29.680> is<00:02:29.859> probably<00:02:30.760> at<00:02:30.969> least<00:02:31.060> a

00:02:31.429 --> 00:02:31.439 
there which is probably at least a

00:02:31.439 --> 00:02:36.569 
there which is probably at least a
quarter<00:02:32.439> inch<00:02:32.739> more<00:02:33.159> than<00:02:33.280> that<00:02:34.230> but<00:02:35.430> this<00:02:36.430> is

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:36.579 
quarter inch more than that but this is

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:38.099 
quarter inch more than that but this is
just<00:02:36.790> our<00:02:36.909> head<00:02:37.120> so<00:02:37.329> impressive<00:02:37.870> that<00:02:37.900> it

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:38.109 
just our head so impressive that it

00:02:38.109 --> 00:02:41.569 
just our head so impressive that it
feels<00:02:38.319> great<00:02:38.469> in<00:02:38.650> the<00:02:38.680> hand<00:02:38.739> so<00:02:39.129> in<00:02:39.670> hand<00:02:39.909> shots

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:41.579 
feels great in the hand so in hand shots

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:44.970 
feels great in the hand so in hand shots
it's<00:02:42.579> a<00:02:42.639> good<00:02:42.819> blade<00:02:43.060> this<00:02:43.629> is<00:02:43.799> based<00:02:44.799> on<00:02:44.919> the

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
it's a good blade this is based on the

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:46.530 
it's a good blade this is based on the
simplicity<00:02:45.400> of<00:02:45.609> these<00:02:45.730> curves<00:02:46.060> it<00:02:46.359> works

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
simplicity of these curves it works

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:48.360 
simplicity of these curves it works
extremely<00:02:46.900> well<00:02:47.169> and<00:02:47.620> every<00:02:47.950> grip<00:02:48.159> you<00:02:48.340> can

extremely well and every grip you can

extremely well and every grip you can
you<00:02:48.970> know<00:02:49.060> when<00:02:49.209> you<00:02:49.269> use<00:02:49.389> something<00:02:49.599> in<00:02:49.870> you

you know when you use something in you

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.909 
you know when you use something in you

some<00:02:56.620> draw<00:02:56.829> cuts<00:02:57.129> this<00:02:58.030> is<00:02:58.239> just<00:02:58.480> very

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 
some draw cuts this is just very

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:01.530 
some draw cuts this is just very
versatile<00:02:59.639> you<00:03:00.639> can<00:03:00.669> see<00:03:00.909> a<00:03:00.939> lot<00:03:01.120> of<00:03:01.150> but<00:03:01.389> when

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540 
versatile you can see a lot of but when

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:04.440 
versatile you can see a lot of but when
it<00:03:01.780> is<00:03:01.900> but<00:03:02.200> I<00:03:02.650> know<00:03:03.069> that<00:03:03.340> first<00:03:04.180> of<00:03:04.239> all<00:03:04.359> the

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.450 
it is but I know that first of all the

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:05.729 
it is but I know that first of all the
weight<00:03:04.599> I<00:03:04.629> think<00:03:04.959> he's<00:03:05.079> got<00:03:05.260> a<00:03:05.290> weight<00:03:05.500> maybe

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:05.739 
weight I think he's got a weight maybe

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:07.229 
weight I think he's got a weight maybe
of<00:03:05.950> a<00:03:06.040> year<00:03:06.280> year<00:03:06.459> and<00:03:06.519> a<00:03:06.579> half<00:03:06.700> right<00:03:06.939> now<00:03:06.969> so

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:07.239 
of a year year and a half right now so

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:08.729 
of a year year and a half right now so
that<00:03:07.389> puts<00:03:07.599> people<00:03:07.900> off<00:03:08.049> and<00:03:08.290> then<00:03:08.409> the<00:03:08.530> price

00:03:08.729 --> 00:03:08.739 
that puts people off and then the price

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:10.920 
that puts people off and then the price
tag<00:03:09.010> of<00:03:09.040> around<00:03:09.389> two<00:03:10.389> hundred<00:03:10.540> dollars<00:03:10.840> I

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930 
tag of around two hundred dollars I

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:13.080 
tag of around two hundred dollars I
think<00:03:10.959> it's<00:03:11.200> maybe<00:03:11.319> a<00:03:11.469> shade<00:03:11.650> under<00:03:11.970> can<00:03:12.970> also

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090 
think it's maybe a shade under can also

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:15.509 
think it's maybe a shade under can also
put<00:03:13.419> people<00:03:13.659> off<00:03:13.780> but<00:03:14.560> luckily<00:03:14.979> I<00:03:15.129> do<00:03:15.250> see

00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:15.519 
put people off but luckily I do see

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:18.089 
put people off but luckily I do see

00:03:44.039 --> 00:03:44.049 
more of emotional attachment than

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:46.409 
more of emotional attachment than
anything<00:03:44.229> else<00:03:44.500> in<00:03:45.370> the<00:03:45.519> bush<00:03:45.699> these<00:03:46.000> any<00:03:46.269> of

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:46.419 
anything else in the bush these any of

00:03:46.419 --> 00:03:47.780 
anything else in the bush these any of
these<00:03:46.509> would<00:03:46.659> absolutely<00:03:46.900> serve<00:03:47.379> you<00:03:47.560> well

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
these would absolutely serve you well

the<00:03:48.790> fiddle<00:03:49.030> back<00:03:49.120> again<00:03:49.389> runs<00:03:49.599> about<00:03:49.810> 200

00:03:50.219 --> 00:03:50.229 
the fiddle back again runs about 200

00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:52.289 
the fiddle back again runs about 200
dollars<00:03:50.349> about<00:03:51.040> 200<00:03:51.459> for<00:03:51.579> the<00:03:51.669> Skookum<00:03:52.060> I

00:03:52.289 --> 00:03:52.299 
dollars about 200 for the Skookum I

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:57.689 
dollars about 200 for the Skookum I
think<00:03:52.780> Brian's<00:03:53.650> is<00:03:53.919> maybe<00:03:54.519> 160<00:03:55.180> 170<00:03:55.509> so<00:03:56.699> a

00:03:57.689 --> 00:03:57.699 
think Brian's is maybe 160 170 so a

00:03:57.699 --> 00:04:00.449 
think Brian's is maybe 160 170 so a
little<00:03:58.650> cheaper<00:03:59.650> than<00:03:59.680> the<00:03:59.859> others<00:04:00.129> and<00:04:00.340> then

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:00.459 
little cheaper than the others and then

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:02.339 
little cheaper than the others and then
the<00:04:00.579> Moores<00:04:00.819> a<00:04:00.909> whopping<00:04:01.540> ten<00:04:01.720> dollars<00:04:02.109> so

00:04:02.339 --> 00:04:02.349 
the Moores a whopping ten dollars so

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:03.780 
the Moores a whopping ten dollars so
there<00:04:03.069> is<00:04:03.189> a<00:04:03.220> reason<00:04:03.519> that<00:04:03.549> this<00:04:03.729> is

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:03.790 
there is a reason that this is

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:05.309 
there is a reason that this is
recommended<00:04:04.419> and<00:04:04.509> used<00:04:04.629> by<00:04:04.750> so<00:04:04.930> many<00:04:05.079> folks

00:04:05.309 --> 00:04:05.319 
recommended and used by so many folks

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:07.589
