00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
see if it's sufficient to do round like

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:12.950 
see if it's sufficient to do round like
this<00:01:11.490> but<00:01:11.729> it's<00:01:11.850> still<00:01:12.030> pretty<00:01:12.330> darn<00:01:12.510> chunky

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.719 
Charlotte so let's give this little baby
a<00:01:31.140> chance<00:01:31.650> I'd<00:01:31.950> say<00:01:32.130> it<00:01:32.250> weighs

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
a chance I'd say it weighs

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.149 
a chance I'd say it weighs
I'm<00:01:32.880> guessing<00:01:33.329> 30<00:01:33.600> 35<00:01:34.200> pounds<00:01:34.740> something<00:01:34.920> like

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
I'm guessing 30 35 pounds something like

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.950 
I'm guessing 30 35 pounds something like
that<00:01:35.400> I<00:01:35.700> didn't<00:01:36.689> exactly<00:01:36.930> rig<00:01:37.799> up<00:01:37.979> this<00:01:38.960> cord

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
that I didn't exactly rig up this cord

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.140 
that I didn't exactly rig up this cord
the<00:01:40.110> way<00:01:40.229> it<00:01:40.290> said<00:01:40.590> to<00:01:40.829> but<00:01:41.009> it<00:01:41.130> works<00:01:41.670> a<00:01:41.909> kid

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
the way it said to but it works a kid

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.429 
the way it said to but it works a kid
make<00:01:42.360> the<00:01:42.450> cord<00:01:42.689> fit<00:01:42.899> in<00:01:43.020> through<00:01:43.140> the<00:01:43.259> hole

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
make the cord fit in through the hole

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:47.270 
make the cord fit in through the hole
the<00:01:43.590> way<00:01:43.680> they<00:01:43.880> draw<00:01:44.880> it<00:01:45.030> on<00:01:45.090> the<00:01:45.240> diagram<00:01:46.280> what

myself<00:01:58.530> so<00:01:58.829> we'll<00:01:58.920> see<00:01:59.100> how<00:01:59.219> it<00:01:59.310> does

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.540 

that<00:02:44.690> how's<00:02:44.870> it<00:02:45.080> doing<00:02:45.440> pretty<00:02:45.709> darn<00:02:45.950> great<00:02:46.280> up

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:46.550 
that how's it doing pretty darn great up

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:47.860 
that how's it doing pretty darn great up
the<00:02:46.670> honest<00:02:46.970> with<00:02:47.120> you<00:02:47.209> now<00:02:47.300> I<00:02:47.330> can<00:02:47.599> see<00:02:47.750> the

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
the honest with you now I can see the

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:50.470 
the honest with you now I can see the
rocks<00:02:48.140> and<00:02:49.130> make<00:02:49.280> up<00:02:49.430> the<00:02:49.550> rocks<00:02:49.760> with<00:02:50.030> lodges

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
rocks and make up the rocks with lodges

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.540 
rocks and make up the rocks with lodges
pressing<00:02:50.870> up<00:02:50.989> all<00:02:51.200> the<00:02:51.349> clods<00:02:51.620> and<00:02:52.400> then

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:52.550 
pressing up all the clods and then

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:54.010 
pressing up all the clods and then
finding<00:02:52.940> the<00:02:53.030> rocks<00:02:53.239> and<00:02:53.540> checking<00:02:53.840> them<00:02:53.930> out

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:54.020 
finding the rocks and checking them out

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:55.660 
finding the rocks and checking them out
of<00:02:54.140> the<00:02:54.230> way<00:02:54.410> okay<00:02:54.890> so<00:02:54.950> what<00:02:55.220> would<00:02:55.340> I<00:02:55.400> say

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
of the way okay so what would I say

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:57.370 
of the way okay so what would I say
initially<00:02:56.150> about<00:02:56.360> it<00:02:56.540> was<00:02:56.660> kind<00:02:57.020> of<00:02:57.110> counting

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:57.380 
initially about it was kind of counting

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:00.100 
initially about it was kind of counting
a<00:02:57.440> little<00:02:57.680> bad<00:02:57.980> but<00:02:58.340> gopher<00:02:58.880> with<00:02:59.030> you<00:02:59.239> it<00:02:59.810> bets

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.110 
a little bad but gopher with you it bets

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:01.660 
a little bad but gopher with you it bets
that<00:03:00.319> the<00:03:00.440> clods<00:03:00.680> real<00:03:01.010> efficiently<00:03:01.489> so<00:03:01.610> you

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:01.670 
that the clods real efficiently so you

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:03.699 
that the clods real efficiently so you
can<00:03:01.849> see<00:03:02.000> where<00:03:02.180> the<00:03:02.239> rocks<00:03:02.450> are<00:03:02.690> if<00:03:03.410> you<00:03:03.530> take

00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:03.709 
can see where the rocks are if you take

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:04.930 
can see where the rocks are if you take
your<00:03:03.830> time<00:03:03.980> pick<00:03:04.220> up<00:03:04.340> the<00:03:04.430> rocks<00:03:04.610> and<00:03:04.760> check

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:04.940 
your time pick up the rocks and check

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:06.100 
your time pick up the rocks and check
them<00:03:05.060> out<00:03:05.120> this<00:03:05.269> thing's<00:03:05.450> doing<00:03:05.690> great<00:03:05.930> I'm

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:06.110 
them out this thing's doing great I'm

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:07.570 
them out this thing's doing great I'm
going<00:03:06.260> to<00:03:06.319> keep<00:03:06.440> on<00:03:06.620> going<00:03:06.920> and<00:03:07.130> let's<00:03:07.310> see<00:03:07.459> how

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:07.580 
going to keep on going and let's see how

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:52.860 
going to keep on going and let's see how
it<00:03:07.640> looks<00:03:07.819> when<00:03:07.970> finished

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:52.870 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:57.000 

I<00:03:53.340> think<00:03:54.340> it<00:03:54.459> kicks<00:03:54.730> butt<00:03:55.180> be<00:03:56.110> honest<00:03:56.530> we<00:03:56.650> it

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:57.010 
I think it kicks butt be honest we it

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:59.280 
I think it kicks butt be honest we it
did<00:03:57.250> everything<00:03:57.849> I<00:03:58.120> wanted<00:03:58.450> to<00:03:58.540> do<00:03:58.690> I'm<00:03:59.230> a

00:03:59.280 --> 00:03:59.290

did everything I wanted to do I'm a
little<00:03:59.830> tired<00:04:00.099> but<00:04:00.220> I'm<00:04:00.430> actually<00:04:00.640> stopped<00:04:01.090> I

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:01.450 
little tired but I'm actually stopped I

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:03.570 
little tired but I'm actually stopped I
don't<00:04:02.260> know<00:04:02.349> six<00:04:02.739> or<00:04:02.830> seven<00:04:03.099> times<00:04:03.310> just

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:03.580 
don't know six or seven times just

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:05.009 
don't know six or seven times just
reposition<00:04:04.150> the<00:04:04.239> camera<00:04:04.569> so<00:04:04.659> you<00:04:04.720> can<00:04:04.810> see

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:11.309 
and it's just a supposedly a cultivator
but<00:04:10.299> it<00:04:10.390> works<00:04:10.569> pretty<00:04:10.780> good<00:04:10.900> it's<00:04:11.140> just<00:04:11.170> a

00:04:11.309 --> 00:04:11.319 
but it works pretty good it's just a

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:12.539 
but it works pretty good it's just a
little<00:04:11.620> tiller<00:04:11.890> if<00:04:12.069> you<00:04:12.159> got<00:04:12.310> the<00:04:12.430> ground
