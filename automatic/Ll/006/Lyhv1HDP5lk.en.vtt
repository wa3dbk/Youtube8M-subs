for<00:00:27.960> the<00:00:27.990> same<00:00:28.500> behavior<00:00:29.130> over<00:00:29.789> and<00:00:29.939> over<00:00:30.060> ten

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
for the same behavior over and over ten

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.590 
for the same behavior over and over ten
times<00:00:30.900> and<00:00:31.760> every<00:00:32.760> time<00:00:32.790> he<00:00:33.030> does<00:00:33.420> the

times and every time he does the
behavior<00:00:33.780> correct<00:00:34.350> you<00:00:34.950> will<00:00:35.100> get<00:00:35.220> a<00:00:35.280> treat

the other hand at the end of ten treats

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.080 
the other hand at the end of ten treats
we<00:00:43.410> will<00:00:43.590> count<00:00:43.770> to<00:00:44.040> see<00:00:44.280> how<00:00:44.310> much<00:00:44.820> of<00:00:45.000> a

boy sit down stinked good chill and as
you<00:01:50.539> can<00:01:50.750> see<00:01:50.780> you<00:01:51.140> bandon<00:01:51.770> was<00:01:52.129> ten<00:01:52.520> for<00:01:52.759> ten

00:01:52.959 --> 00:01:52.969 
you can see you bandon was ten for ten

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:55.839 
you can see you bandon was ten for ten
so<00:01:53.719> then<00:01:53.989> it<00:01:54.200> knows<00:01:54.349> how<00:01:54.409> to<00:01:54.679> stand<00:01:55.069> at<00:01:55.429> one

00:01:55.839 --> 00:01:55.849 
so then it knows how to stand at one

00:01:55.849 --> 00:02:01.839 
so then it knows how to stand at one
hundred<00:01:56.060> percent<00:01:56.379> accuracy<00:01:57.379> good<00:01:58.340> ah<00:02:00.849> the

00:02:01.839 --> 00:02:01.849 
hundred percent accuracy good ah the

00:02:01.849 --> 00:02:04.029 
hundred percent accuracy good ah the
tenth<00:02:02.119> read<00:02:02.390> game<00:02:02.659> is<00:02:02.899> a<00:02:02.959> test<00:02:03.409> to<00:02:03.619> see<00:02:03.799> how

00:02:04.029 --> 00:02:04.039 
tenth read game is a test to see how

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:06.160 
tenth read game is a test to see how
well<00:02:04.069> a<00:02:04.520> dog<00:02:04.700> knows<00:02:04.969> a<00:02:05.000> particular<00:02:05.659> behavior

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.170 
well a dog knows a particular behavior

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:08.169 
well a dog knows a particular behavior
it<00:02:06.770> is<00:02:06.920> a<00:02:06.950> fun<00:02:07.250> way<00:02:07.459> to<00:02:07.489> test<00:02:07.849> the<00:02:08.030> reliability

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179 
it is a fun way to test the reliability

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:11.680 
it is a fun way to test the reliability
of<00:02:08.780> a<00:02:09.200> variety<00:02:09.410> of<00:02:09.739> tricks<00:02:10.039> or<00:02:10.250> behaviors<00:02:10.940> if<00:02:11.480> a

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
of a variety of tricks or behaviors if a

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:13.420 
of a variety of tricks or behaviors if a
dog<00:02:11.870> is<00:02:12.079> at<00:02:12.230> one-hundred<00:02:12.440> percent<00:02:12.739> accuracy

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
dog is at one-hundred percent accuracy

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:15.400 
dog is at one-hundred percent accuracy
in<00:02:13.730> the<00:02:13.849> house<00:02:14.030> but<00:02:14.629> only<00:02:14.750> sixty<00:02:15.230> percent

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 
in the house but only sixty percent

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:17.349 
in the house but only sixty percent
accuracy<00:02:16.069> for<00:02:16.400> the<00:02:16.489> same<00:02:16.700> behavior<00:02:17.150> at<00:02:17.239> the

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:17.359 
accuracy for the same behavior at the

00:02:17.359 --> 00:02:19.420 
accuracy for the same behavior at the
park<00:02:17.629> then<00:02:18.140> you<00:02:18.290> know<00:02:18.440> where<00:02:18.709> your<00:02:18.920> dog<00:02:19.129> needs

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
park then you know where your dog needs

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.940 
park then you know where your dog needs
to<00:02:19.549> practice<00:02:19.849> and<00:02:20.329> possibly<00:02:21.109> relearn<00:02:21.680> the

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
to practice and possibly relearn the

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:24.430 
to practice and possibly relearn the
behavior
