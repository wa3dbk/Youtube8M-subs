stainless-steel food mill has a lot of
great<00:00:20.640> features<00:00:20.910> starting<00:00:21.480> with<00:00:21.779> these<00:00:21.960> three

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
great features starting with these three

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.849 
great features starting with these three
discs<00:00:22.740> fine<00:00:23.279> medium<00:00:23.939> and<00:00:24.300> coarse<00:00:24.529> each<00:00:25.529> of<00:00:25.800> the

discs fine medium and coarse each of the
perforations

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
perforations

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.849 
perforations
on<00:00:26.820> the<00:00:27.150> disk<00:00:27.390> have<00:00:27.689> a<00:00:27.720> raised<00:00:28.050> edge<00:00:28.380> it

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
on the disk have a raised edge it

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.769 
on the disk have a raised edge it
catches<00:00:29.460> the<00:00:29.580> food<00:00:29.849> so<00:00:30.210> much<00:00:30.390> better<00:00:30.599> than

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
catches the food so much better than

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.959 
catches the food so much better than
traditional<00:00:30.960> food<00:00:31.529> mills<00:00:31.769> making<00:00:32.520> for<00:00:32.730> much

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
traditional food mills making for much

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.690 
traditional food mills making for much
more<00:00:33.329> effective<00:00:34.140> milling<00:00:34.739> let<00:00:35.399> me<00:00:35.489> show<00:00:35.640> you

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
more effective milling let me show you

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.370 
more effective milling let me show you
how<00:00:35.880> to<00:00:35.940> assemble<00:00:36.239> the<00:00:36.420> mill<00:00:36.660> and<00:00:36.960> then<00:00:37.170> we'll

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
how to assemble the mill and then we'll

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.319 
how to assemble the mill and then we'll
get<00:00:37.500> started<00:00:37.680> making<00:00:38.040> some<00:00:38.219> recipes<00:00:38.700> I'm

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
get started making some recipes I'm

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.780 
get started making some recipes I'm
going<00:00:39.629> to<00:00:39.690> use<00:00:39.899> the<00:00:40.110> fine<00:00:40.440> disc<00:00:40.739> I<00:00:41.100> simply

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
going to use the fine disc I simply

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.119 
going to use the fine disc I simply
place<00:00:41.969> it<00:00:42.270> on<00:00:42.390> the<00:00:42.570> stem<00:00:42.899> and<00:00:43.200> here's<00:00:43.980> another

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
place it on the stem and here's another

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.310 
place it on the stem and here's another
really<00:00:44.670> great<00:00:44.969> unique<00:00:45.390> feature<00:00:45.719> this<00:00:46.079> is<00:00:46.200> the

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
really great unique feature this is the

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.740 
really great unique feature this is the
wiper<00:00:46.710> bar<00:00:47.129> and<00:00:47.460> this<00:00:48.000> goes<00:00:48.300> on<00:00:48.450> the<00:00:48.480> bottom

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
wiper bar and this goes on the bottom

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.080 
wiper bar and this goes on the bottom
right<00:00:49.110> here<00:00:49.469> and<00:00:49.649> as<00:00:50.250> you're<00:00:50.640> milling<00:00:50.969> your

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
right here and as you're milling your

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.420 
right here and as you're milling your
food<00:00:51.390> this<00:00:51.780> rotates<00:00:52.350> around<00:00:52.500> and<00:00:52.860> releases

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
food this rotates around and releases

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.760 
food this rotates around and releases
the<00:00:53.550> food<00:00:53.789> from<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.239> disk<00:00:54.690> makes<00:00:55.289> for<00:00:55.500> very

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
the food from the disk makes for very

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.709 
the food from the disk makes for very
efficient<00:00:56.280> milling<00:00:56.610> so<00:00:57.120> the<00:00:57.239> final<00:00:57.480> step<00:00:57.690> for

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
efficient milling so the final step for

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.410 
efficient milling so the final step for
assembly<00:00:58.289> is<00:00:58.469> to<00:00:58.800> insert<00:00:59.219> this<00:00:59.460> into<00:00:59.789> the<00:01:00.210> bowl

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
assembly is to insert this into the bowl

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.990 
assembly is to insert this into the bowl
and<00:01:01.320> it<00:01:01.980> helps<00:01:02.250> you<00:01:02.340> put<00:01:02.579> a<00:01:02.609> little<00:01:02.789> pressure

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
and it helps you put a little pressure

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.310 
and it helps you put a little pressure
on<00:01:03.390> the<00:01:03.600> bar<00:01:03.840> and<00:01:05.390> the<00:01:06.390> little<00:01:06.600> teeth<00:01:06.810> grab<00:01:07.110> our

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
on the bar and the little teeth grab our

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.490 
on the bar and the little teeth grab our
spring-loaded<00:01:08.010> system<00:01:08.869> and<00:01:09.869> there<00:01:10.200> you<00:01:10.320> have

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
spring-loaded system and there you have

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:16.580 
spring-loaded system and there you have
it<00:01:11.330> that<00:01:12.330> noise<00:01:12.689> you<00:01:13.049> hear<00:01:13.560> is<00:01:14.720> this<00:01:15.720> rotating

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
it that noise you hear is this rotating

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.429 
it that noise you hear is this rotating
blade<00:01:16.979> making<00:01:17.430> contact<00:01:18.240> with<00:01:18.540> our<00:01:18.960> disk<00:01:19.229> and

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
blade making contact with our disk and

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.320 
blade making contact with our disk and
that's<00:01:19.560> a<00:01:19.650> good<00:01:19.830> thing<00:01:19.890> that<00:01:20.340> means<00:01:20.909> that<00:01:21.119> all

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
that's a good thing that means that all
