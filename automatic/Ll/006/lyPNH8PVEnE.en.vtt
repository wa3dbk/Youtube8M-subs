00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
it's faulty thinking or have i damaged

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.049 
it's faulty thinking or have i damaged
it<00:00:55.230> or<00:00:55.530> was<00:00:55.680> it<00:00:55.800> faulty<00:00:56.160> originally<00:00:56.730> so<00:00:56.969> the

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
it or was it faulty originally so the

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:58.340 
it or was it faulty originally so the
best<00:00:57.239> thing<00:00:57.390> that<00:00:57.420> there<00:00:57.690> is<00:00:57.750> just<00:00:57.960> a<00:00:58.050> quickly

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
best thing that there is just a quickly

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.060 
best thing that there is just a quickly
test<00:00:58.590> each<00:00:58.770> one<00:00:59.010> that<00:00:59.160> you<00:00:59.219> have<00:01:00.980> even<00:01:01.980> if

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
test each one that you have even if

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.399 
test each one that you have even if
you're<00:01:02.219> not<00:01:02.460> buying<00:01:03.449> a<00:01:03.660> lot<00:01:03.840> and<00:01:03.989> it's<00:01:04.110> just<00:01:04.199> a

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
you're not buying a lot and it's just a

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.200 
you're not buying a lot and it's just a
one-off<00:01:04.650> job<00:01:05.070> then<00:01:05.339> it's<00:01:05.519> a<00:01:05.610> good<00:01:05.729> idea<00:01:05.790> just

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
one-off job then it's a good idea just

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.500 
one-off job then it's a good idea just
to<00:01:06.799> pass<00:01:07.799> it<00:01:07.950> strip<00:01:08.189> your<00:01:08.310> desk<00:01:08.610> like<00:01:09.210> down

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
to pass it strip your desk like down

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.240 
to pass it strip your desk like down
just<00:01:09.930> put<00:01:10.080> it<00:01:10.170> back<00:01:10.290> together<00:01:10.439> like<00:01:10.799> this<00:01:11.040> and

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
just put it back together like this and

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.920 
just put it back together like this and
then<00:01:11.490> you<00:01:11.580> can<00:01:11.670> just<00:01:11.880> test<00:01:12.119> the<00:01:12.299> screen<00:01:12.570> as<00:01:12.780> it

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
then you can just test the screen as it

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.050 
then you can just test the screen as it
comes<00:01:13.200> you<00:01:13.920> know<00:01:14.130> in<00:01:14.250> your<00:01:14.369> mind<00:01:14.580> yeah<00:01:14.880> that

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
comes you know in your mind yeah that

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.270 
comes you know in your mind yeah that
works<00:01:15.330> or<00:01:15.750> it<00:01:16.290> doesn't<00:01:16.500> work<00:01:16.650> and<00:01:17.040> if<00:01:17.159> it

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
works or it doesn't work and if it

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.770 
works or it doesn't work and if it
doesn't<00:01:17.580> work<00:01:17.729> it<00:01:17.909> can<00:01:18.060> send<00:01:18.330> it<00:01:18.479> back<00:01:18.509> without

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
doesn't work it can send it back without

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.710 
doesn't work it can send it back without
any<00:01:19.080> signs<00:01:19.409> of<00:01:19.590> fitting<00:01:19.979> or<00:01:20.880> if<00:01:21.150> it<00:01:21.299> does<00:01:21.479> work

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
any signs of fitting or if it does work

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.600 
any signs of fitting or if it does work
then<00:01:22.020> you<00:01:22.380> know<00:01:22.500> you<00:01:22.710> know<00:01:22.830> great<00:01:23.159> will<00:01:23.369> care

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
then you know you know great will care

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:24.920 
then you know you know great will care
not<00:01:23.880> where<00:01:24.119> it's<00:01:24.270> you're<00:01:24.390> confident<00:01:24.780> about

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
not where it's you're confident about

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:33.410 
not where it's you're confident about
the<00:01:25.200> fitment<00:01:25.409> process<00:01:30.140> okay<00:01:31.140> the<00:01:32.360> what<00:01:33.360> I

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
the fitment process okay the what I

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.060 
the fitment process okay the what I
wanted<00:01:33.630> to<00:01:33.720> show<00:01:33.900> you<00:01:33.960> next<00:01:34.290> is<00:01:34.560> just<00:01:34.890> how

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
wanted to show you next is just how

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.390 
wanted to show you next is just how
sensitive<00:01:35.810> the<00:01:36.810> pushing<00:01:37.680> the<00:01:37.799> cable<00:01:38.130> into<00:01:38.280> the

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
sensitive the pushing the cable into the

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.030 
sensitive the pushing the cable into the
peterey<00:01:38.820> connector<00:01:39.270> can<00:01:39.479> be<00:01:39.680> if<00:01:40.680> you<00:01:40.890> don't

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
peterey connector can be if you don't

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.920 
peterey connector can be if you don't
push<00:01:41.250> this<00:01:41.430> in<00:01:41.640> all<00:01:41.790> away<00:01:42.090> even<00:01:42.479> if<00:01:42.570> it's<00:01:42.720> out

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
push this in all away even if it's out

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.260

the top screen doesn't come on now if

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.020 
the top screen doesn't come on now if
you<00:02:16.530> fit<00:02:16.860> this<00:02:17.040> it's<00:02:17.310> all<00:02:17.459> on<00:02:17.580> the<00:02:17.670> case<00:02:17.849> and

actually<00:02:24.840> faulty<00:02:25.260> it's<00:02:25.410> just<00:02:25.680> that<00:02:25.799> you

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
actually faulty it's just that you

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.559 
actually faulty it's just that you
haven't<00:02:26.099> quite<00:02:26.310> pushed<00:02:26.670> this<00:02:26.879> cable<00:02:27.330> in<00:02:27.420> all

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569 
haven't quite pushed this cable in all

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:32.180 
haven't quite pushed this cable in all
the<00:02:27.720> way<00:02:27.870> so<00:02:28.680> pop<00:02:29.220> that<00:02:29.370> cable<00:02:29.730> back<00:02:29.910> open<00:02:31.190> the

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
the way so pop that cable back open the

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:33.559 
the way so pop that cable back open the
way<00:02:32.310> out<00:02:32.430> really<00:02:32.670> like<00:02:32.849> the<00:02:32.970> fit<00:02:33.150> it<00:02:33.299> was<00:02:33.390> just

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:33.569 
way out really like the fit it was just

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:35.839 
way out really like the fit it was just
a<00:02:33.690> you<00:02:34.290> know<00:02:34.410> push<00:02:35.040> that<00:02:35.190> all<00:02:35.370> that<00:02:35.519> and<00:02:35.760> then

00:02:35.839 --> 00:02:35.849 
a you know push that all that and then

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:36.740 
a you know push that all that and then
you<00:02:35.940> can<00:02:36.000> get<00:02:36.120> a<00:02:36.180> little<00:02:36.329> bit<00:02:36.480> of<00:02:36.569> pressure

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
you can get a little bit of pressure

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:41.589 
you can get a little bit of pressure
behind<00:02:37.200> the<00:02:37.410> cable<00:02:37.799> without<00:02:38.610> damaging<00:02:39.090> it<00:02:39.209> and

00:02:41.589 --> 00:02:41.599 

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:44.000 

you<00:02:42.599> know<00:02:42.720> hopefully<00:02:43.019> as<00:02:43.290> you<00:02:43.380> can<00:02:43.530> see<00:02:43.799> that

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
you know hopefully as you can see that

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:49.100 
you know hopefully as you can see that
is<00:02:44.220> now<00:02:44.549> it's<00:02:45.450> a<00:02:45.569> lot<00:02:45.720> of<00:02:45.810> closer<00:02:46.079> in<00:02:46.410> there<00:02:48.110> and

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
is now it's a lot of closer in there and

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:54.030 
is now it's a lot of closer in there and
then<00:02:49.290> if<00:02:49.379> you<00:02:49.470> close<00:02:49.709> that<00:02:49.739> and<00:02:50.099> turn<00:02:50.280> that<00:02:50.459> on

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:55.960 

there<00:02:54.670> we<00:02:54.790> go

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:55.970 
there we go

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:57.520 
there we go
so<00:02:56.540> that's<00:02:56.750> that's<00:02:56.900> the<00:02:57.050> first<00:02:57.080> thing<00:02:57.440> to

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
so that's that's the first thing to

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:58.600 
so that's that's the first thing to
check<00:02:57.560> when<00:02:57.980> you<00:02:58.070> get<00:02:58.220> in<00:02:58.310> that<00:02:58.400> situation

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:58.610 
check when you get in that situation

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:01.870 
check when you get in that situation
where<00:02:59.210> it<00:02:59.270> won't<00:02:59.390> turn<00:02:59.690> on
