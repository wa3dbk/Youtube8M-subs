00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
they feel them in the almost an

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.720 
they feel them in the almost an
additional<00:01:00.989> month<00:01:01.289> of<00:01:01.590> development<00:01:02.489> time

additional month of development time

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.210 
additional month of development time
will<00:01:03.390> allow<00:01:03.660> them<00:01:03.989> to<00:01:04.199> then<00:01:04.379> work<00:01:04.680> on<00:01:04.979> those

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
will allow them to then work on those

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.240 
will allow them to then work on those
issues<00:01:05.640> and<00:01:06.240> clear<00:01:06.930> that<00:01:07.110> stuff<00:01:07.470> up<00:01:07.710> maybe<00:01:08.040> and

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
issues and clear that stuff up maybe and

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.899 
issues and clear that stuff up maybe and
they'll<00:01:08.400> have<00:01:08.670> a<00:01:08.909> much<00:01:10.220> smoother<00:01:11.220> you<00:01:11.790> know

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
they'll have a much smoother you know

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.910 
they'll have a much smoother you know
indoctrination<00:01:12.720> period<00:01:13.380> of<00:01:13.500> having<00:01:13.890> that

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
indoctrination period of having that

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.280 
indoctrination period of having that
early<00:01:14.369> at<00:01:14.490> least<00:01:14.700> i'm<00:01:14.970> so<00:01:15.540> maybe<00:01:15.750> they<00:01:15.930> maybe

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
early at least i'm so maybe they maybe

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.620 
early at least i'm so maybe they maybe
that's<00:01:16.650> the<00:01:17.070> concept<00:01:17.700> if<00:01:17.939> indeed<00:01:18.420> these

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
that's the concept if indeed these

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.039 
that's the concept if indeed these
rumors<00:01:19.080> aren't<00:01:19.290> true<00:01:20.119> the<00:01:21.119> other<00:01:21.360> thing<00:01:21.720> of<00:01:21.900> it

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
rumors aren't true the other thing of it

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.560 
rumors aren't true the other thing of it
is<00:01:22.170> is<00:01:22.470> that<00:01:23.040> i<00:01:23.340> didn't<00:01:23.970> i<00:01:24.060> don't<00:01:24.270> know<00:01:24.420> how

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
is is that i didn't i don't know how

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.539 
is is that i didn't i don't know how
much<00:01:24.840> of<00:01:24.869> an<00:01:25.140> impact<00:01:25.500> of<00:01:25.710> how<00:01:25.830> positive<00:01:26.400> this

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
much of an impact of how positive this

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.810 
much of an impact of how positive this
would<00:01:26.820> be<00:01:27.030> on<00:01:27.210> them<00:01:27.509> but<00:01:27.799> the<00:01:28.799> excitement<00:01:29.310> of

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
would be on them but the excitement of

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.149 
would be on them but the excitement of
the<00:01:30.509> season<00:01:31.049> and<00:01:31.170> new<00:01:31.320> season<00:01:31.740> beginning

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
the season and new season beginning

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.609 
the season and new season beginning
actually<00:01:33.119> could<00:01:33.299> help<00:01:33.540> bolster<00:01:33.810> some<00:01:34.320> sales

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
actually could help bolster some sales

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.350 
actually could help bolster some sales
but<00:01:35.040> the<00:01:35.460> reason<00:01:35.729> why<00:01:35.820> i<00:01:35.880> don't<00:01:36.060> know<00:01:36.210> if

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
but the reason why i don't know if

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.690 
but the reason why i don't know if
that's<00:01:36.540> necessarily<00:01:36.720> a<00:01:37.310> legitimate<00:01:38.310> factor

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
that's necessarily a legitimate factor

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.910 
that's necessarily a legitimate factor
is<00:01:38.820> because<00:01:39.090> the<00:01:39.180> NBA<00:01:39.390> 2k<00:01:39.869> is<00:01:40.020> taking<00:01:40.409> on<00:01:40.560> such

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
is because the NBA 2k is taking on such

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.340 
is because the NBA 2k is taking on such
a<00:01:40.950> high<00:01:41.460> level<00:01:41.520> of<00:01:41.939> popularity<00:01:42.119> I<00:01:42.810> don't<00:01:43.259> know

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
a high level of popularity I don't know

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.590 
a high level of popularity I don't know
necessarily<00:01:43.649> they<00:01:44.280> need<00:01:44.490> to<00:01:44.610> springboard<00:01:45.360> off

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
necessarily they need to springboard off

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.810 
necessarily they need to springboard off
of<00:01:45.780> the<00:01:45.930> exact<00:01:46.380> beginning<00:01:46.829> of<00:01:46.950> the<00:01:47.040> NBA<00:01:47.310> season

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
of the exact beginning of the NBA season

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.030 
of the exact beginning of the NBA season
I<00:01:47.970> mean<00:01:48.479> we've<00:01:48.810> gotten<00:01:49.079> to<00:01:49.170> the<00:01:49.259> point<00:01:49.530> that<00:01:49.649> 2k

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
I mean we've gotten to the point that 2k

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.460 
I mean we've gotten to the point that 2k
is<00:01:50.340> such<00:01:50.579> a<00:01:50.610> big<00:01:50.939> deal<00:01:51.210> that<00:01:51.509> people

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
is such a big deal that people

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.170 
is such a big deal that people
associated<00:01:53.130> with<00:01:53.399> the<00:01:53.700> beginning<00:01:54.030> of<00:01:54.119> the

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
associated with the beginning of the

enough<00:03:31.650> for<00:03:31.889> that<00:03:32.010> and<00:03:32.579> on<00:03:33.150> top<00:03:33.419> of<00:03:33.480> that<00:03:33.690> would

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
enough for that and on top of that would

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:38.330 
enough for that and on top of that would
they<00:03:34.889> be<00:03:35.790> willing<00:03:36.299> to<00:03:36.540> drop<00:03:36.989> down<00:03:37.530> some<00:03:38.040> money

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
they be willing to drop down some money

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:39.920 
they be willing to drop down some money
for<00:03:38.639> both<00:03:38.819> games<00:03:39.090> because<00:03:39.299> ultimately<00:03:39.599> you're

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
for both games because ultimately you're

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:42.439 
for both games because ultimately you're
still<00:03:40.139> paying<00:03:40.379> more<00:03:41.159> than<00:03:41.190> the<00:03:41.400> 50<00:03:41.549> 998<00:03:42.299> that

still paying more than the 50 998 that

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:43.729 
still paying more than the 50 998 that
you<00:03:42.599> would<00:03:42.720> pay<00:03:42.900> for<00:03:42.930> you<00:03:43.199> just<00:03:43.409> picking<00:03:43.620> one

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:43.739 
you would pay for you just picking one

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:46.640 
you would pay for you just picking one
so<00:03:44.639> this<00:03:44.879> was<00:03:45.060> this<00:03:45.479> would<00:03:45.690> seem<00:03:45.930> tomorrow

familiar<00:04:52.810> spice<00:04:53.379> work<00:04:53.650> but<00:04:54.490> i<00:04:54.520> think<00:04:54.879> it's

00:04:55.019 --> 00:04:55.029 
familiar spice work but i think it's

00:04:55.029 --> 00:04:57.989 
familiar spice work but i think it's
interested<00:04:55.419> and<00:04:56.139> one<00:04:56.710> thing<00:04:57.249> that<00:04:57.279> I<00:04:57.550> noticed

00:04:57.989 --> 00:04:57.999 
interested and one thing that I noticed

00:04:57.999 --> 00:04:59.760 
interested and one thing that I noticed
they<00:04:58.120> said<00:04:58.389> takes<00:04:58.840> you<00:04:59.020> through<00:04:59.229> an<00:04:59.319> entire

00:04:59.760 --> 00:04:59.770 
they said takes you through an entire

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:02.969 
they said takes you through an entire
career<00:05:00.330> so<00:05:01.330> what<00:05:01.509> that<00:05:01.539> made<00:05:01.930> me<00:05:02.169> think<00:05:02.680> is

00:05:02.969 --> 00:05:02.979 
career so what that made me think is

00:05:02.979 --> 00:05:06.540 
career so what that made me think is
that<00:05:04.229> you<00:05:05.229> know<00:05:05.379> the<00:05:05.560> way<00:05:05.710> that<00:05:05.979> my<00:05:06.129> career<00:05:06.490> is

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:06.550 
that you know the way that my career is

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:09.089 
that you know the way that my career is
now<00:05:06.969> I<00:05:07.360> don't<00:05:07.870> know<00:05:07.990> how<00:05:08.169> long<00:05:08.379> it<00:05:08.620> goes<00:05:08.830> i

00:05:09.089 --> 00:05:09.099 
now I don't know how long it goes i

00:05:09.099 --> 00:05:10.740 
now I don't know how long it goes i
think<00:05:09.279> maybe<00:05:09.430> first<00:05:09.759> two<00:05:09.969> or<00:05:10.060> three<00:05:10.240> seasons

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:10.750 
think maybe first two or three seasons

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:12.269 
think maybe first two or three seasons
is<00:05:10.900> when<00:05:11.050> you're<00:05:11.199> still<00:05:11.439> seeing<00:05:11.650> cutscenes

00:05:12.269 --> 00:05:12.279 
is when you're still seeing cutscenes

00:05:12.279 --> 00:05:14.309 
is when you're still seeing cutscenes
but<00:05:12.610> if<00:05:13.120> you<00:05:13.240> play<00:05:13.509> longer<00:05:13.779> than<00:05:14.020> that<00:05:14.139> you

00:05:14.309 --> 00:05:14.319 
but if you play longer than that you

00:05:14.319 --> 00:05:17.670 
but if you play longer than that you
probably<00:05:14.560> don't<00:05:15.159> see<00:05:15.430> it<00:05:15.550> anymore<00:05:16.300> so<00:05:17.169> i<00:05:17.409> don't

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:17.680 
probably don't see it anymore so i don't

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:19.649 
probably don't see it anymore so i don't
know<00:05:17.889> i<00:05:17.919> mean<00:05:18.310> i'm<00:05:18.580> really<00:05:18.939> thinking<00:05:19.120> that<00:05:19.419> 2k

00:05:19.649 --> 00:05:19.659 
know i mean i'm really thinking that 2k

00:05:19.659 --> 00:05:23.159 
know i mean i'm really thinking that 2k
should<00:05:20.110> really<00:05:20.409> incorporate<00:05:21.370> the<00:05:22.169> carryover

00:05:23.159 --> 00:05:23.169 
should really incorporate the carryover

00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:26.820 
should really incorporate the carryover
save<00:05:23.589> that<00:05:24.400> MLB<00:05:25.029> has<00:05:25.349> introduced<00:05:26.349> with<00:05:26.620> their

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:26.830 
save that MLB has introduced with their

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:29.249 
save that MLB has introduced with their
road<00:05:27.520> to<00:05:27.669> the<00:05:27.759> show<00:05:27.939> and<00:05:28.210> franchise<00:05:28.749> mode<00:05:29.020> I

00:05:29.249 --> 00:05:29.259 
road to the show and franchise mode I

00:05:29.259 --> 00:05:31.350 
road to the show and franchise mode I
mean<00:05:29.830> to<00:05:30.189> me<00:05:30.339> it<00:05:30.430> makes<00:05:30.580> it<00:05:30.699> even<00:05:30.759> more<00:05:30.909> sense

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:31.360 
mean to me it makes it even more sense

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:35.040 
mean to me it makes it even more sense
for<00:05:31.830> NBA<00:05:32.830> 2k<00:05:33.339> to<00:05:33.400> do<00:05:33.639> it<00:05:33.759> because<00:05:34.050> you're

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:35.050 
for NBA 2k to do it because you're

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:36.809 
for NBA 2k to do it because you're
creating<00:05:35.560> this<00:05:35.680> character<00:05:36.279> and<00:05:36.400> people<00:05:36.699> have

00:05:36.809 --> 00:05:36.819 
creating this character and people have

00:05:36.819 --> 00:05:39.540 
creating this character and people have
become<00:05:37.060> more<00:05:37.509> attached<00:05:37.900> to<00:05:38.680> their<00:05:38.830> my<00:05:39.099> career

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:39.550 
become more attached to their my career

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:41.490 
become more attached to their my career
guard<00:05:39.819> and<00:05:40.120> my<00:05:40.270> player<00:05:40.569> guy<00:05:40.810> that<00:05:41.080> they<00:05:41.289> have

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:41.500 
guard and my player guy that they have

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:44.760 
guard and my player guy that they have
for<00:05:41.889> any<00:05:42.069> of<00:05:42.250> those<00:05:42.370> other<00:05:42.689> similar<00:05:43.689> modes<00:05:44.409> for

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:44.770 
for any of those other similar modes for

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:47.100 
for any of those other similar modes for
other<00:05:45.009> sports<00:05:45.399> games<00:05:45.669> so<00:05:46.000> I<00:05:46.240> really<00:05:46.810> think<00:05:46.960> it

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:47.110 
other sports games so I really think it

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:49.019 
other sports games so I really think it
makes<00:05:47.289> total<00:05:47.500> sense<00:05:47.680> for<00:05:48.009> 2k<00:05:48.310> to<00:05:48.370> adopt<00:05:48.879> that

00:05:49.019 --> 00:05:49.029 
makes total sense for 2k to adopt that

00:05:49.029 --> 00:05:50.939 
makes total sense for 2k to adopt that
and<00:05:49.389> if<00:05:49.839> you're<00:05:50.020> talking<00:05:50.319> about<00:05:50.469> taking<00:05:50.830> us

00:05:50.939 --> 00:05:50.949 
and if you're talking about taking us

00:05:50.949 --> 00:05:52.800 
and if you're talking about taking us
through<00:05:50.979> their<00:05:51.279> entire<00:05:51.520> career<00:05:52.270> journey

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:52.810 
through their entire career journey

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:55.350 
through their entire career journey
makes<00:05:53.560> it<00:05:54.069> makes<00:05:54.279> a<00:05:54.370> lot<00:05:54.490> of<00:05:54.550> sense<00:05:54.669> especially

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:55.360 
makes it makes a lot of sense especially

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:57.149 
makes it makes a lot of sense especially
if<00:05:55.719> you're<00:05:55.839> bringing<00:05:56.229> in<00:05:56.319> spike<00:05:56.620> and<00:05:56.830> all<00:05:56.949> that

00:05:57.149 --> 00:05:57.159 
if you're bringing in spike and all that

pick what era you wanted your myplayer

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:32.340 
pick what era you wanted your myplayer
to<00:06:29.320> go<00:06:29.500> through<00:06:29.770> so<00:06:30.420> are<00:06:31.420> they<00:06:31.570> gonna<00:06:31.690> be<00:06:31.780> from

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:32.350 
to go through so are they gonna be from

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:35.010 
to go through so are they gonna be from
the<00:06:32.470> 60s<00:06:33.040> to<00:06:33.160> 70s<00:06:33.190> the<00:06:33.820> 80s<00:06:33.850> the<00:06:34.330> 90s<00:06:34.540> or<00:06:34.930> the

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:35.020 
the 60s to 70s the 80s the 90s or the

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:39.540 
the 60s to 70s the 80s the 90s or the
2000s<00:06:35.890> or<00:06:36.600> present<00:06:37.600> day<00:06:37.920> man<00:06:38.920> I<00:06:38.950> think<00:06:39.370> that

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:39.550 
2000s or present day man I think that

would be so awesome especially if you
had<00:06:42.130> presentations<00:06:43.090> in<00:06:43.240> math<00:06:43.450> so<00:06:43.690> if<00:06:43.750> they

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:43.840 
had presentations in math so if they

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:45.840 
had presentations in math so if they
going<00:06:44.080> through<00:06:44.140> the<00:06:44.290> 60s<00:06:44.770> maybe<00:06:45.280> you<00:06:45.490> got<00:06:45.640> like
