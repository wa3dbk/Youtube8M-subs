00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
now what I'm going to do is my hot glue

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.330 
now what I'm going to do is my hot glue
gun<00:02:39.510> has<00:02:39.870> been<00:02:39.900> on<00:02:40.170> for<00:02:40.440> a<00:02:40.470> while<00:02:40.500> so<00:02:40.980> it's<00:02:41.130> very

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
gun has been on for a while so it's very

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.830 
gun has been on for a while so it's very
hot<00:02:41.700> so<00:02:42.420> it'll<00:02:42.600> take<00:02:42.840> the<00:02:42.989> glue<00:02:43.200> longer<00:02:43.890> to

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
hot so it'll take the glue longer to

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.360 
hot so it'll take the glue longer to
melt<00:02:45.840> because<00:02:46.140> that's<00:02:46.560> what<00:02:46.709> we<00:02:46.860> want<00:02:47.160> we<00:02:47.340> want

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
melt because that's what we want we want

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:48.979 
melt because that's what we want we want
to<00:02:47.670> be<00:02:47.760> able<00:02:47.850> to<00:02:48.090> kind<00:02:48.300> of<00:02:48.360> stir<00:02:48.690> it<00:02:48.840> together

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:48.989 
to be able to kind of stir it together

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:51.590 
to be able to kind of stir it together
and<00:02:49.440> you're<00:02:50.040> just<00:02:50.130> kind<00:02:50.250> of<00:02:50.580> put<00:02:50.940> some<00:02:50.970> in<00:02:51.450> on

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
the top o the hot glue also creates a

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.880 
the top o the hot glue also creates a
watery<00:02:56.670> look<00:02:56.970> and<00:02:57.300> then<00:02:58.260> you<00:02:58.380> just<00:02:58.560> want<00:02:58.769> to
