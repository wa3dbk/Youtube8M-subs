00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:45.750 
are going to mount to the seat
right<00:02:42.379> here<00:02:42.909> and<00:02:44.140> install<00:02:45.140> the<00:02:45.290> bushing

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
right here and install the bushing

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:52.619 
right here and install the bushing
bushing<00:02:46.760> goes<00:02:46.970> in<00:02:47.239> this<00:02:47.690> direction<00:02:49.480> like<00:02:50.480> so

00:02:52.619 --> 00:02:52.629 
bushing goes in this direction like so

00:02:52.629 --> 00:02:55.180 
bushing goes in this direction like so
there's<00:02:53.629> a<00:02:53.720> key<00:02:54.049> you<00:02:54.440> can<00:02:54.620> see<00:02:54.799> that<00:02:54.950> it<00:02:55.010> needs

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.190 
there's a key you can see that it needs

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:58.030 
there's a key you can see that it needs
to<00:02:55.310> go<00:02:55.430> in<00:02:55.610> and<00:02:56.299> then<00:02:56.420> this<00:02:56.540> will<00:02:56.840> slide<00:02:57.080> on<00:02:57.349> to

sometimes<00:03:23.299> the<00:03:23.480> material<00:03:23.599> will<00:03:23.930> actually

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:24.290 
sometimes the material will actually

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:26.349 
sometimes the material will actually
come<00:03:24.500> out<00:03:24.530> farther<00:03:25.010> than<00:03:25.190> it's<00:03:25.879> supposed<00:03:26.269> to

be and you can see here that's going to
be<00:03:28.640> the<00:03:28.819> groove<00:03:29.060> for<00:03:29.209> our<00:03:29.329> Eclipse<00:03:30.010> this

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.010 
be the groove for our Eclipse this

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:32.589 
be the groove for our Eclipse this
bracket<00:03:31.459> needs<00:03:31.640> to<00:03:31.790> go<00:03:31.910> on<00:03:31.940> with<00:03:32.150> this<00:03:32.269> notch

00:03:32.589 --> 00:03:32.599

facing forward and that's for the

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:37.119 
facing forward and that's for the
clearance<00:03:34.670> of<00:03:34.819> the<00:03:34.940> upper<00:03:35.440> portion<00:03:36.440> bar<00:03:36.980> of

drop<00:04:29.960> the<00:04:31.060> 5/16<00:04:32.060> bolt<00:04:32.270> through<00:04:32.630> the<00:04:32.660> bracket

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:32.870 
drop the 5/16 bolt through the bracket

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:35.560 
drop the 5/16 bolt through the bracket
and<00:04:33.260> then<00:04:33.500> down<00:04:33.740> through<00:04:33.770> the<00:04:34.130> hole<00:04:34.760> through

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:35.570 
and then down through the hole through

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:38.800 
and then down through the hole through
the<00:04:35.770> holes<00:04:36.770> that<00:04:36.950> we<00:04:37.010> drilled<00:04:37.100> and<00:04:37.970> this<00:04:38.660> is

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:38.810 
the holes that we drilled and this is

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:40.060 
the holes that we drilled and this is
where<00:04:38.960> you'll<00:04:39.110> need<00:04:39.260> probably<00:04:39.530> two<00:04:39.710> people

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:40.070 
where you'll need probably two people

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:42.940 
where you'll need probably two people
one<00:04:40.220> person<00:04:40.430> to<00:04:40.669> tighten<00:04:41.000> hold<00:04:41.780> the<00:04:41.960> bolt<00:04:42.650> head

bottom as well to disperse some of the
stress<00:04:53.750> on<00:04:53.960> the<00:04:54.229> sheet<00:04:54.440> metal<00:04:54.560> all<00:04:55.250> right<00:04:55.400> so

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:55.490 
stress on the sheet metal all right so

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:56.800 
stress on the sheet metal all right so
we're<00:04:55.610> gonna<00:04:55.669> go<00:04:55.910> ahead<00:04:56.030> and<00:04:56.150> do<00:04:56.300> that<00:04:56.330> now<00:04:56.600> but

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:56.810 
we're gonna go ahead and do that now but

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:59.230 
we're gonna go ahead and do that now but
we'll<00:04:56.930> take<00:04:57.020> a<00:04:57.080> video<00:04:57.289> of<00:04:57.410> it<00:04:57.560> installed<00:04:58.240> all

00:04:59.230 --> 00:04:59.240 
we'll take a video of it installed all

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:01.540 
we'll take a video of it installed all
righty<00:04:59.510> so<00:04:59.750> you<00:04:59.840> can<00:04:59.990> see<00:05:00.200> here<00:05:00.650> how<00:05:01.160> the<00:05:01.220> bolt

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:01.550 
righty so you can see here how the bolt

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:05.440 
righty so you can see here how the bolt
goes<00:05:01.789> through<00:05:02.060> the<00:05:02.150> floor<00:05:02.450> underneath<00:05:04.450> to

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:05.450 
goes through the floor underneath to

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:06.940 
goes through the floor underneath to
bridge<00:05:05.660> this<00:05:05.900> gap<00:05:05.960> I'm<00:05:06.410> going<00:05:06.530> to<00:05:06.590> slide<00:05:06.770> in

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:06.950 
bridge this gap I'm going to slide in

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:10.390 
bridge this gap I'm going to slide in
three<00:05:07.810> 5/16<00:05:08.810> flat<00:05:09.050> washers<00:05:09.500> over<00:05:09.919> our<00:05:10.070> drilled

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:10.400 
three 5/16 flat washers over our drilled

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:15.010 
three 5/16 flat washers over our drilled
hole<00:05:10.660> then<00:05:11.660> thread<00:05:12.169> or<00:05:13.010> drop<00:05:13.370> this<00:05:14.300> bolt<00:05:14.720> the

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:15.020 
hole then thread or drop this bolt the

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:18.700 
hole then thread or drop this bolt the
5/16<00:05:15.860> hex<00:05:16.160> head<00:05:16.460> bolt<00:05:16.700> through<00:05:17.270> and<00:05:17.750> through

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:18.710 
5/16 hex head bolt through and through

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:20.290 
5/16 hex head bolt through and through
the<00:05:18.830> drilled<00:05:19.130> hole<00:05:19.370> in<00:05:19.520> the<00:05:19.610> floorboard<00:05:19.880> and

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:20.300 
the drilled hole in the floorboard and

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:23.620 
the drilled hole in the floorboard and
that<00:05:20.960> will<00:05:21.200> intern<00:05:21.830> space<00:05:22.610> it<00:05:22.820> up<00:05:22.940> so<00:05:23.479> it's

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:23.630 
that will intern space it up so it's

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:25.690 
that will intern space it up so it's
even<00:05:24.020> on<00:05:24.139> both<00:05:24.320> sides<00:05:24.380> so<00:05:25.190> we<00:05:25.310> have<00:05:25.430> both<00:05:25.639> of

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:25.700 
even on both sides so we have both of

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:27.790 
even on both sides so we have both of
our<00:05:25.970> bolts<00:05:26.599> drop<00:05:26.930> through<00:05:27.110> with<00:05:27.320> our<00:05:27.470> spacer

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:27.800 
our bolts drop through with our spacer

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:30.580 
our bolts drop through with our spacer
washers<00:05:28.220> on<00:05:28.430> both<00:05:28.669> sides<00:05:28.940> now<00:05:29.210> and<00:05:30.050> I'm<00:05:30.500> gonna

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:30.590 
washers on both sides now and I'm gonna

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:32.740 
washers on both sides now and I'm gonna
go<00:05:30.770> underneath<00:05:31.070> and<00:05:31.520> we'll<00:05:32.270> get<00:05:32.599> this

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:32.750 
go underneath and we'll get this

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:34.089 
go underneath and we'll get this
tightened<00:05:33.110> up<00:05:33.229> and<00:05:33.500> we'll<00:05:33.740> show<00:05:33.950> it

00:05:34.089 --> 00:05:34.099 
tightened up and we'll show it

00:05:34.099 --> 00:05:36.909 
tightened up and we'll show it
functioning<00:05:34.550> in<00:05:34.669> here<00:05:34.910> in<00:05:34.970> a<00:05:35.000> second<00:05:35.919> all
