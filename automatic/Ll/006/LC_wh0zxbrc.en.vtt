00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
thermal battery pack now I've reviewed a

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:08.570 
thermal battery pack now I've reviewed a
lot<00:00:07.109> of<00:00:07.230> these<00:00:07.410> external<00:00:07.649> battery<00:00:08.130> packs<00:00:08.340> over

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
lot of these external battery packs over

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.600 
lot of these external battery packs over
the<00:00:08.760> last<00:00:09.080> 3-4<00:00:10.080> months<00:00:10.500> and<00:00:11.280> this<00:00:11.400> one's

the last 3-4 months and this one's

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.520 
the last 3-4 months and this one's
probably<00:00:12.059> gonna<00:00:12.480> go<00:00:12.660> down<00:00:12.840> as<00:00:12.990> my<00:00:13.110> overall

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
probably gonna go down as my overall

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.890 
probably gonna go down as my overall
favorite<00:00:13.769> and<00:00:14.400> I'll<00:00:14.820> show<00:00:14.969> you<00:00:15.030> why<00:00:15.240> first<00:00:15.780> of

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
favorite and I'll show you why first of

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.420 
favorite and I'll show you why first of
all<00:00:16.049> it's<00:00:16.230> about<00:00:16.379> the<00:00:16.590> size<00:00:16.770> of<00:00:16.949> an<00:00:17.100> external

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
all it's about the size of an external

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.640 
all it's about the size of an external
hard<00:00:17.609> drive<00:00:17.670> in<00:00:18.539> terms<00:00:18.810> of<00:00:18.990> size<00:00:19.170> so<00:00:19.439> it's<00:00:19.529> not

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
hard drive in terms of size so it's not

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.040 
hard drive in terms of size so it's not
too<00:00:19.800> big<00:00:20.010> and<00:00:20.160> not<00:00:20.250> too<00:00:20.310> heavy<00:00:20.670> but<00:00:21.050> 12,000

too big and not too heavy but 12,000
million<00:00:22.350> in<00:00:22.500> 3<00:00:22.650> hours<00:00:22.680> means<00:00:23.279> that<00:00:23.490> it's<00:00:23.640> going

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
million in 3 hours means that it's going

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.380 
million in 3 hours means that it's going
to<00:00:23.880> be<00:00:23.970> able<00:00:24.060> to<00:00:24.240> charge<00:00:24.510> a<00:00:25.380> ipad<00:00:26.279> 4<00:00:26.609> completely

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
charges on your iPhone so you see it has

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.240 
charges on your iPhone so you see it has
two<00:00:35.820> outputs<00:00:36.000> it<00:00:36.360> has<00:00:36.450> a<00:00:36.480> 5<00:00:36.989> volt<00:00:37.230> 1<00:00:37.500> amp<00:00:37.530> and<00:00:37.980> a

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
two outputs it has a 5 volt 1 amp and a

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.209 
two outputs it has a 5 volt 1 amp and a
5<00:00:38.489> hole<00:00:38.910> 2.1<00:00:39.750> amps<00:00:40.050> and<00:00:40.649> will<00:00:40.829> look<00:00:40.980> a<00:00:41.070> little

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
5 hole 2.1 amps and will look a little

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.430 
5 hole 2.1 amps and will look a little
bit<00:00:41.399> more<00:00:41.879> in<00:00:41.940> depth<00:00:42.120> in<00:00:42.210> about<00:00:42.329> a<00:00:42.360> second<00:00:42.840> it

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
bit more in depth in about a second it

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.760 
bit more in depth in about a second it
also<00:00:43.559> has<00:00:43.829> a<00:00:43.860> little<00:00:44.219> LED<00:00:44.579> light<00:00:44.610> right<00:00:45.360> there

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:45.770 
also has a little LED light right there

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:49.160 
also has a little LED light right there
it's<00:00:46.770> easy<00:00:46.920> to<00:00:47.100> operate<00:00:47.480> that<00:00:48.480> LED<00:00:48.930> light

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
it's easy to operate that LED light

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.690 
it's easy to operate that LED light
because<00:00:49.739> this<00:00:49.890> is<00:00:50.039> a<00:00:50.070> twelve<00:00:50.370> thousand

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
because this is a twelve thousand

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.369 
because this is a twelve thousand
milliamp<00:00:50.940> your<00:00:51.149> our<00:00:51.239> battery<00:00:51.989> pack<00:00:52.170> will

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
milliamp your our battery pack will

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.860 
milliamp your our battery pack will
actually<00:00:52.620> operate<00:00:52.649> for<00:00:53.579> weeks<00:00:53.820> so<00:00:54.600> if<00:00:54.780> you

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
actually operate for weeks so if you

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.150 
actually operate for weeks so if you
need<00:00:55.110> it<00:00:55.260> you've<00:00:55.440> got<00:00:55.649> a<00:00:55.680> lot<00:00:55.829> of<00:00:55.920> power<00:00:56.070> here

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
need it you've got a lot of power here

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.580 
need it you've got a lot of power here
now<00:00:57.120> how<00:00:57.239> does<00:00:57.329> this<00:00:57.600> whole<00:00:57.809> thing<00:00:57.840> work<00:00:58.109> and

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
now how does this whole thing work and

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.290 
now how does this whole thing work and
why<00:00:59.280> do<00:00:59.340> I<00:00:59.460> think<00:00:59.489> it's<00:00:59.789> one<00:01:00.030> of<00:01:00.090> the<00:01:00.180> better

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
why do I think it's one of the better

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.779 
why do I think it's one of the better
ones<00:01:00.510> I've<00:01:00.629> seen<00:01:00.690> it's<00:01:01.530> not<00:01:01.620> the<00:01:01.829> best<00:01:02.010> first

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
ones I've seen it's not the best first

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.729 
ones I've seen it's not the best first
of<00:01:03.000> all<00:01:03.120> you<00:01:03.390> it<00:01:03.899> comes<00:01:04.170> with<00:01:04.320> a<00:01:04.379> variety<00:01:04.589> of

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
of all you it comes with a variety of

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.219 
of all you it comes with a variety of
tips<00:01:04.979> for<00:01:05.580> charging<00:01:06.000> and<00:01:06.119> what<00:01:06.270> not<00:01:06.450> so<00:01:06.659> you

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
tips for charging and what not so you

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.560 
tips for charging and what not so you
have<00:01:07.470> two<00:01:08.220> different<00:01:08.670> cables<00:01:08.909> that<00:01:09.330> comes

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
have two different cables that comes

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.780 
have two different cables that comes
with<00:01:09.750> and<00:01:10.470> how<00:01:10.650> it<00:01:10.680> works<00:01:11.040> is<00:01:11.220> you've<00:01:11.400> got<00:01:11.610> the

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
with and how it works is you've got the

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.480 
with and how it works is you've got the
different<00:01:12.530> connecting<00:01:13.530> pins<00:01:13.770> and<00:01:14.220> this<00:01:14.310> is

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
different connecting pins and this is

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.609 
different connecting pins and this is
pretty<00:01:14.670> common<00:01:14.850> so<00:01:15.150> here's<00:01:15.360> a<00:01:15.420> thirty<00:01:15.689> pin<00:01:15.900> or

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
pretty common so here's a thirty pin or

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.429 
pretty common so here's a thirty pin or
an<00:01:16.979> iPad<00:01:17.369> but<00:01:18.119> it<00:01:18.240> also<00:01:18.360> comes<00:01:18.689> with<00:01:18.840> a<00:01:18.990> micro

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
an iPad but it also comes with a micro

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.950 
an iPad but it also comes with a micro
and<00:01:19.619> a<00:01:20.130> micro<00:01:21.060> USB<00:01:21.090> a<00:01:21.780> mini<00:01:22.080> USB<00:01:22.320> and<00:01:23.130> a

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:23.960 
and a micro USB a mini USB and a

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.520 
and a micro USB a mini USB and a
charging<00:01:24.960> tip<00:01:25.110> essentially<00:01:25.560> for<00:01:25.799> a<00:01:26.990> PSP<00:01:27.990> so

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
charging tip essentially for a PSP so

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.249 
charging tip essentially for a PSP so
let's<00:01:29.189> look<00:01:29.310> at<00:01:29.460> the<00:01:29.549> micro<00:01:29.880> USB<00:01:30.079> plug<00:01:31.079> give

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
let's look at the micro USB plug give

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:35.510 
let's look at the micro USB plug give
this<00:01:31.350> in<00:01:32.329> like<00:01:33.329> that<00:01:33.680> and<00:01:34.680> you<00:01:34.890> can<00:01:35.009> plug<00:01:35.159> it<00:01:35.340> in

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
this in like that and you can plug it in

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.600 
this in like that and you can plug it in
here<00:01:35.759> to<00:01:35.909> the<00:01:36.000> side<00:01:36.650> which<00:01:37.650> is<00:01:37.829> labeled<00:01:38.310> input

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
here to the side which is labeled input

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:39.950 
here to the side which is labeled input
which<00:01:38.790> is<00:01:38.820> nice<00:01:39.090> so<00:01:39.329> it<00:01:39.420> shows<00:01:39.600> you<00:01:39.689> which<00:01:39.810> is

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
which is nice so it shows you which is

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.100 
which is nice so it shows you which is
which<00:01:40.079> you<00:01:40.950> plug<00:01:41.189> it<00:01:41.310> in<00:01:41.400> there<00:01:41.610> and<00:01:41.939> now<00:01:42.110> you

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
which you plug it in there and now you

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.630 
which you plug it in there and now you
can<00:01:43.350> plug<00:01:43.560> this<00:01:43.590> in<00:01:44.009> and<00:01:44.250> this<00:01:44.340> is<00:01:44.460> how<00:01:44.579> you

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
can plug this in and this is how you

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
difficult to see then I'm using and

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:26.920 
difficult to see then I'm using and
actually<00:02:25.790> some<00:02:25.970> probably<00:02:26.270> be<00:02:26.390> impossible

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
actually some probably be impossible

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.710 
actually some probably be impossible
that<00:02:27.440> the<00:02:27.650> 5<00:02:27.950> volt<00:02:28.250> 2.1<00:02:29.060> amp<00:02:29.239> is<00:02:29.510> what's

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
that the 5 volt 2.1 amp is what's

that the 5 volt 2.1 amp is what's
plugged<00:02:30.080> in<00:02:30.319> so<00:02:31.069> it<00:02:31.190> actually<00:02:31.310> gives<00:02:31.550> you<00:02:31.760> a
