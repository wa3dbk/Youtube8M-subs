to have the damage proficiency for to
not<00:00:13.380> suck<00:00:14.630> it's<00:00:15.630> not<00:00:15.839> terrible<00:00:16.320> without<00:00:16.529> the

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
not suck it's not terrible without the

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.680 
not suck it's not terrible without the
damage<00:00:16.890> proficiency<00:00:17.460> but<00:00:18.060> you<00:00:18.240> get<00:00:18.449> like

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
damage proficiency but you get like

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.439 
damage proficiency but you get like
close<00:00:19.109> range<00:00:19.470> have<00:00:19.800> markers<00:00:20.189> and<00:00:20.490> long-range

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
close range have markers and long-range

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.689 
close range have markers and long-range
it<00:00:21.660> takes<00:00:21.869> like<00:00:22.050> three<00:00:22.320> shots<00:00:22.560> and<00:00:22.949> that's

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
it takes like three shots and that's

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.609 
it takes like three shots and that's
just<00:00:23.850> not<00:00:23.939> a<00:00:24.090> lot<00:00:24.210> of<00:00:24.449> fun<00:00:24.630> but<00:00:24.840> if<00:00:25.199> you<00:00:25.289> put<00:00:25.500> on

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
just not a lot of fun but if you put on

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.740 
just not a lot of fun but if you put on
the<00:00:25.769> damage<00:00:26.010> proficiency<00:00:26.609> you<00:00:27.150> get<00:00:27.390> one<00:00:27.720> shot

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
the damage proficiency you get one shot

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.160 
the damage proficiency you get one shot
kills<00:00:28.199> from<00:00:28.320> a<00:00:28.439> pretty<00:00:28.590> good<00:00:28.740> distance<00:00:29.060> and

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:30.170 
kills from a pretty good distance and

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:32.990 
kills from a pretty good distance and
two<00:00:31.170> shot<00:00:31.380> kills<00:00:31.650> most<00:00:32.369> of<00:00:32.460> the<00:00:32.520> time<00:00:32.669> it's<00:00:32.820> two

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
two shot kills most of the time it's two

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.840 
two shot kills most of the time it's two
shots<00:00:33.500> it<00:00:34.500> rarely<00:00:34.860> takes<00:00:35.190> three<00:00:35.460> most<00:00:35.700> of<00:00:35.790> the

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
shots it rarely takes three most of the

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.850 
shots it rarely takes three most of the
time<00:00:36.000> one<00:00:36.239> to<00:00:36.360> two<00:00:36.510> and<00:00:36.690> that's<00:00:37.559> pretty<00:00:37.680> good

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
time one to two and that's pretty good

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.459 
time one to two and that's pretty good
considering<00:00:38.280> the<00:00:38.790> fire<00:00:39.420> in<00:00:39.570> the<00:00:39.930> fire<00:00:40.140> rate<00:00:40.320> on

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
considering the fire in the fire rate on

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.940 
considering the fire in the fire rate on
this<00:00:40.620> is<00:00:41.090> not<00:00:42.090> that<00:00:42.540> high<00:00:42.840> but<00:00:43.170> you<00:00:43.739> can't

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
this is not that high but you can't

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.350 
this is not that high but you can't
shoot<00:00:44.100> it<00:00:44.219> fairly<00:00:44.399> quickly<00:00:44.520> it's<00:00:45.000> a<00:00:45.090> fully

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
shoot it fairly quickly it's a fully

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.690 
shoot it fairly quickly it's a fully
automatic<00:00:45.809> shotgun<00:00:46.440> but<00:00:47.010> I<00:00:47.039> kind<00:00:47.399> of<00:00:47.489> use<00:00:47.670> it

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
automatic shotgun but I kind of use it

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.290 
automatic shotgun but I kind of use it
like<00:00:47.910> it's<00:00:48.090> a<00:00:48.149> semi-auto<00:00:48.570> I<00:00:49.500> use<00:00:49.950> it<00:00:50.100> much<00:00:50.460> like

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
like it's a semi-auto I use it much like

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.360 
like it's a semi-auto I use it much like

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
I use the m1014 from cod4 mw2 because it

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.040 
I use the m1014 from cod4 mw2 because it
kind<00:00:56.789> of<00:00:56.820> feels<00:00:56.969> like<00:00:57.180> has<00:00:57.390> that<00:00:57.570> same<00:00:57.780> kind<00:00:57.960> of

fire<00:00:58.230> rate<00:00:58.500> and<00:00:58.739> damage<00:00:59.070> but<00:00:59.699> I<00:00:59.730> really<00:01:00.510> like

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
fire rate and damage but I really like

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.990

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
perks here and kind of the best setup

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.230 
perks here and kind of the best setup
that<00:01:06.630> you're<00:01:06.780> going<00:01:06.930> to<00:01:06.990> use<00:01:07.049> for<00:01:07.470> a<00:01:07.530> shotgun

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:08.240 
that you're going to use for a shotgun

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.719 
that you're going to use for a shotgun
so<00:01:09.240> with<00:01:09.540> this<00:01:09.659> one<00:01:09.900> I<00:01:09.930> like<00:01:10.260> to<00:01:10.710> use<00:01:10.979> extreme

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
so with this one I like to use extreme

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.580 
so with this one I like to use extreme
conditioning<00:01:12.270> because<00:01:12.750> with<00:01:13.140> extended<00:01:13.560> mags

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
conditioning because with extended mags

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.219 
conditioning because with extended mags
I<00:01:13.950> get<00:01:14.130> eight<00:01:14.310> shots<00:01:14.640> so<00:01:15.390> you<00:01:15.840> know<00:01:15.930> what's<00:01:16.140> the

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
I get eight shots so you know what's the

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.350 
I get eight shots so you know what's the
time<00:01:16.409> one<00:01:16.590> to<00:01:16.710> two<00:01:16.830> kills<00:01:17.070> that's<00:01:17.580> for<00:01:18.030> one<00:01:18.240> to

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
time one to two kills that's for one to

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.980 
time one to two kills that's for one to
two<00:01:18.420> shots<00:01:18.780> to<00:01:19.080> get<00:01:20.040> a<00:01:20.070> kill<00:01:20.450> that's<00:01:21.450> usually

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
two shots to get a kill that's usually

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.390 
two shots to get a kill that's usually
at<00:01:22.049> least<00:01:22.080> four<00:01:22.500> kills<00:01:22.740> before<00:01:23.040> I'd<00:01:23.130> have<00:01:23.280> to

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
at least four kills before I'd have to

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.160 
at least four kills before I'd have to
reload<00:01:23.729> so<00:01:24.000> I<00:01:24.240> don't<00:01:24.720> really<00:01:24.750> worry<00:01:25.080> about

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
reload so I don't really worry about

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.530 
reload so I don't really worry about
having<00:01:25.619> slight<00:01:25.950> of<00:01:26.040> hand<00:01:26.100> on<00:01:26.310> this<00:01:26.430> class<00:01:26.700> it

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
having slight of hand on this class it

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.359 
having slight of hand on this class it
has<00:01:27.600> a<00:01:27.720> built<00:01:28.020> in<00:01:28.200> extreme<00:01:28.530> conditioning<00:01:29.100> so

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
has a built in extreme conditioning so

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.789 
has a built in extreme conditioning so
if<00:01:29.759> you<00:01:29.939> put<00:01:30.150> extreme<00:01:30.360> conditioning<00:01:30.869> on<00:01:31.049> plus

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.260 
use assassin is probably the most
intelligent<00:01:51.780> choice<00:01:52.189> based<00:01:53.189> on<00:01:53.430> the<00:01:53.579> UAV<00:01:54.000> spam

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
intelligent choice based on the UAV spam

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.100 
intelligent choice based on the UAV spam
so<00:01:56.000> second<00:01:57.000> perk<00:01:57.149> doesn't<00:01:57.630> really<00:01:57.780> affect<00:01:58.049> the

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
so second perk doesn't really affect the

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.899 
so second perk doesn't really affect the
shotgun<00:01:58.590> but<00:01:58.979> what's<00:01:59.189> really<00:01:59.340> important<00:01:59.820> is

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
shotgun but what's really important is

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:03.859 
shotgun but what's really important is
the<00:02:00.149> third<00:02:00.420> perk<00:02:00.689> and<00:02:00.899> not<00:02:01.200> not<00:02:01.770> for<00:02:02.070> the<00:02:02.869> while

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
the third perk and not not for the while

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.020 
the third perk and not not for the while
the<00:02:03.899> third<00:02:04.110> perk<00:02:04.320> is<00:02:04.409> studying<00:02:04.680> but<00:02:05.250> the<00:02:05.790> point

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
the third perk is studying but the point

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.459 
the third perk is studying but the point
of<00:02:06.060> steady<00:02:06.299> aim<00:02:06.420> is<00:02:06.600> not<00:02:06.630> to<00:02:06.840> get<00:02:07.110> the<00:02:07.229> smaller

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
of steady aim is not to get the smaller

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.650 
of steady aim is not to get the smaller
hipfire<00:02:07.860> like<00:02:08.069> that<00:02:08.250> does<00:02:08.429> help<00:02:08.580> a<00:02:08.759> bit<00:02:09.000> but

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
hipfire like that does help a bit but

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.350 
hipfire like that does help a bit but
what<00:02:09.989> helps<00:02:10.259> more<00:02:10.500> is<00:02:10.739> the<00:02:11.099> studying<00:02:11.910> pro

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
what helps more is the studying pro

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.790 
what helps more is the studying pro
which<00:02:13.020> allows<00:02:13.590> you

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
which allows you

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.070 
which allows you
stop<00:02:14.070> faster<00:02:14.550> than<00:02:14.760> running<00:02:14.970> so<00:02:15.570> you<00:02:15.960> have

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
stop faster than running so you have

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.840 
stop faster than running so you have
this<00:02:16.200> shotgun<00:02:16.440> here<00:02:16.770> that<00:02:16.920> you<00:02:17.040> can<00:02:17.310> run<00:02:17.580> for<00:02:17.820> a

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850 
this shotgun here that you can run for a

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:20.840 
this shotgun here that you can run for a
very<00:02:18.060> long<00:02:18.180> time<00:02:18.240> with<00:02:18.660> and<00:02:19.670> you're<00:02:20.670> going<00:02:20.760> to

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
very long time with and you're going to

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:23.390 
very long time with and you're going to
be<00:02:20.940> running<00:02:21.180> a<00:02:21.450> lot<00:02:21.720> so<00:02:22.320> when<00:02:22.920> you<00:02:23.040> go<00:02:23.130> to<00:02:23.190> shoot

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
be running a lot so when you go to shoot

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:24.890 
be running a lot so when you go to shoot
at<00:02:23.490> somebody<00:02:23.670> you<00:02:24.120> obviously<00:02:24.480> can't<00:02:24.690> shoot

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
at somebody you obviously can't shoot

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.930 
at somebody you obviously can't shoot
them<00:02:25.110> while<00:02:25.350> you're<00:02:25.560> running<00:02:25.710> so<00:02:26.400> having

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
them while you're running so having

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.690 
them while you're running so having
steady<00:02:27.300> aim<00:02:27.480> pro<00:02:27.510> will<00:02:28.110> allow<00:02:28.470> you<00:02:28.530> to<00:02:28.710> stop

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
steady aim pro will allow you to stop

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.270 
steady aim pro will allow you to stop
running<00:02:29.910> quicker<00:02:30.840> and<00:02:31.140> allow<00:02:31.920> you<00:02:31.980> to<00:02:32.100> kill

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
running quicker and allow you to kill

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:33.740 
running quicker and allow you to kill
people<00:02:32.400> so<00:02:33.000> if<00:02:33.120> you're<00:02:33.270> running<00:02:33.480> out<00:02:33.510> a<00:02:33.570> guy

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
people so if you're running out a guy

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:35.270 
people so if you're running out a guy
guys<00:02:34.140> running<00:02:34.410> at<00:02:34.470> you<00:02:34.590> you<00:02:34.800> have<00:02:34.920> steady<00:02:35.160> aim

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
guys running at you you have steady aim

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:36.680 
guys running at you you have steady aim
pro<00:02:35.310> you're<00:02:35.730> gonna<00:02:35.820> stop<00:02:36.120> first<00:02:36.420> you're<00:02:36.600> going

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
pro you're gonna stop first you're going

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.360 
pro you're gonna stop first you're going
to<00:02:36.810> shoot<00:02:37.140> first<00:02:37.440> and<00:02:37.590> you<00:02:37.680> have<00:02:37.770> a<00:02:37.830> shotgun<00:02:38.220> so

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.810 
you're probably gonna kill them the
first<00:02:39.480> shot<00:02:39.780> and<00:02:40.490> yeah<00:02:41.490> that's<00:02:41.610> really

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:41.820 
first shot and yeah that's really

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:44.800 
first shot and yeah that's really
awesome<00:02:42.290> so<00:02:43.290> I've<00:02:43.680> probably<00:02:43.950> already<00:02:44.130> ruined

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
awesome so I've probably already ruined

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:46.820 
awesome so I've probably already ruined
what's<00:02:45.810> gonna<00:02:45.930> happen<00:02:46.230> in<00:02:46.320> this<00:02:46.380> video<00:02:46.680> with

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
what's gonna happen in this video with

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:50.120 
what's gonna happen in this video with
the<00:02:46.890> title<00:02:47.220> but<00:02:47.790> I<00:02:48.120> do<00:02:48.840> get<00:02:49.230> a<00:02:49.410> MOAB<00:02:49.740> in<00:02:50.010> this

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
the title but I do get a MOAB in this

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:51.910 
the title but I do get a MOAB in this
game<00:02:50.370> and<00:02:50.490> I'm<00:02:50.610> not<00:02:50.760> using<00:02:51.000> a<00:02:51.150> specialist

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920

killstreak<00:02:52.920> load<00:02:53.100> of<00:02:53.250> which<00:02:53.700> really<00:02:54.240> isn't

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
killstreak load of which really isn't

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.840 
killstreak load of which really isn't
all<00:02:54.720> that<00:02:54.780> important<00:02:55.640> even<00:02:56.640> with<00:02:56.760> the

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
all that important even with the

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:58.250 
all that important even with the
specialist<00:02:57.300> bonus<00:02:57.570> what<00:02:57.720> do<00:02:57.810> I<00:02:57.900> get<00:02:58.080> that<00:02:58.200> I

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
specialist bonus what do I get that I

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.410 
specialist bonus what do I get that I
really<00:02:58.500> need<00:02:58.710> like<00:02:59.280> I<00:02:59.310> guess<00:02:59.730> a<00:03:00.000> couple<00:03:00.240> more

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
really need like I guess a couple more

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:04.310 
really need like I guess a couple more
proficiencies<00:03:01.020> range<00:03:01.440> helps<00:03:01.770> a<00:03:01.860> bit<00:03:02.070> and<00:03:03.320> what

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:04.320 
proficiencies range helps a bit and what

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:05.810 
proficiencies range helps a bit and what
else<00:03:04.440> having<00:03:04.860> slight<00:03:05.040> of<00:03:05.130> hand<00:03:05.160> helps<00:03:05.550> i<00:03:05.640> guess

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:05.820 
else having slight of hand helps i guess

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:07.370 
else having slight of hand helps i guess
but<00:03:06.030> reloading<00:03:06.840> is<00:03:06.930> not<00:03:07.050> really<00:03:07.230> an<00:03:07.320> issue

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
but reloading is not really an issue

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.980 
but reloading is not really an issue
here<00:03:07.970> I've<00:03:08.970> gotten<00:03:09.270> really<00:03:09.420> good<00:03:09.510> at<00:03:09.630> this<00:03:09.810> map

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:09.990 
here I've gotten really good at this map

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:11.840 
here I've gotten really good at this map
Commission's<00:03:10.500> one<00:03:10.890> of<00:03:10.980> the<00:03:11.070> maps<00:03:11.250> I<00:03:11.580> actually

Commission's one of the maps I actually

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:13.910 
Commission's one of the maps I actually
really<00:03:12.180> enjoy<00:03:12.420> playing<00:03:12.450> and<00:03:13.020> its<00:03:13.590> really<00:03:13.740> well

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920

really enjoy playing and its really well
suited<00:03:14.250> for<00:03:14.280> a<00:03:14.490> shotgun<00:03:14.910> because<00:03:15.360> if<00:03:16.350> you<00:03:16.470> stay

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
suited for a shotgun because if you stay

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.350 
suited for a shotgun because if you stay
on<00:03:16.650> this<00:03:16.800> top<00:03:17.040> area<00:03:17.400> here<00:03:17.700> you're<00:03:18.180> almost

on this top area here you're almost

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.630 
on this top area here you're almost

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 
always close range and as long as you

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:21.830 
always close range and as long as you

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
don't go out of it like you'll see this

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.420 
don't go out of it like you'll see this
entire<00:03:22.140> game<00:03:22.350> I<00:03:22.500> don't<00:03:22.830> really<00:03:23.040> leave<00:03:23.250> this

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
entire game I don't really leave this

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:25.790 
entire game I don't really leave this
top<00:03:23.760> area<00:03:24.090> because<00:03:24.780> the<00:03:24.900> enemy<00:03:25.020> team<00:03:25.320> runs

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:25.800 
top area because the enemy team runs

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.010 
top area because the enemy team runs
down<00:03:26.160> here<00:03:26.489> all<00:03:27.300> the<00:03:27.450> time<00:03:27.480> this<00:03:27.720> is<00:03:27.780> pretty

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:28.020 
down here all the time this is pretty

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:29.930 
down here all the time this is pretty
much<00:03:28.080> where<00:03:28.290> everybody<00:03:28.680> rushes<00:03:28.920> to<00:03:29.250> so<00:03:29.880> you

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
much where everybody rushes to so you

way<00:04:04.410> here<00:04:04.739> I<00:04:04.920> would<00:04:05.370> have<00:04:05.459> ran<00:04:05.670> back<00:04:05.880> behind

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 
way here I would have ran back behind

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:08.420 
way here I would have ran back behind
the<00:04:06.300> cover<00:04:06.480> because<00:04:06.750> I<00:04:07.230> obviously<00:04:07.800> can't<00:04:08.190> hit

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:08.430 
the cover because I obviously can't hit

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:10.070 
the cover because I obviously can't hit
them<00:04:08.580> if<00:04:08.790> they're<00:04:09.000> 100<00:04:09.480> feet<00:04:09.690> away<00:04:09.780> because

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:10.080 
them if they're 100 feet away because

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:13.400 
them if they're 100 feet away because
well<00:04:10.890> a<00:04:10.920> real<00:04:11.310> shotgun<00:04:11.790> probably<00:04:12.180> could<00:04:12.410> call

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:13.410 
well a real shotgun probably could call

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:16.159 
well a real shotgun probably could call
of<00:04:13.500> duty<00:04:13.709> shotguns<00:04:14.130> have<00:04:14.670> like<00:04:15.000> 20<00:04:15.840> feet<00:04:16.019> of

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:16.169 
of duty shotguns have like 20 feet of

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:18.110 
of duty shotguns have like 20 feet of
range<00:04:16.440> which<00:04:17.070> is<00:04:17.100> okay<00:04:17.519> they're<00:04:17.760> actually

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:18.120 
range which is okay they're actually

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.060 
range which is okay they're actually
fairly<00:04:18.959> effective<00:04:19.470> here<00:04:19.650> if<00:04:19.830> it<00:04:19.919> had<00:04:20.040> a

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070 
fairly effective here if it had a

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:22.190 
fairly effective here if it had a
hundred<00:04:20.430> feet<00:04:20.459> of<00:04:20.850> range<00:04:21.390> then<00:04:22.020> they'd

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:22.200 
hundred feet of range then they'd

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:23.420 
hundred feet of range then they'd
probably<00:04:22.440> have<00:04:22.560> to<00:04:22.740> give<00:04:22.890> it<00:04:22.979> like<00:04:23.130> zero

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430 
probably have to give it like zero

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.860 
probably have to give it like zero
damage<00:04:23.760> at<00:04:24.180> that<00:04:24.810> distance

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:25.870 
damage at that distance

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:26.879 
damage at that distance
it<00:04:25.960> would<00:04:26.080> just<00:04:26.110> be<00:04:26.320> pointless<00:04:26.590> you'd<00:04:26.800> be

00:04:26.879 --> 00:04:26.889 
it would just be pointless you'd be

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:28.290 
it would just be pointless you'd be
getting<00:04:26.979> hit<00:04:27.220> workers<00:04:27.520> book<00:04:27.729> well<00:04:27.910> I<00:04:27.940> get

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:28.300 
getting hit workers book well I get

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:30.000 
getting hit workers book well I get
hundred<00:04:28.690> hit<00:04:28.870> workers<00:04:29.229> or<00:04:29.410> cross<00:04:29.590> my<00:04:29.800> up<00:04:29.860> with

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:30.010 
hundred hit workers or cross my up with

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:31.740 
hundred hit workers or cross my up with
shotgun<00:04:30.430> you<00:04:31.030> know<00:04:31.180> that<00:04:31.330> they<00:04:31.540> have<00:04:31.630> to

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:31.750 
shotgun you know that they have to

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:33.000 
shotgun you know that they have to
balance<00:04:31.900> things<00:04:32.199> out<00:04:32.410> so<00:04:32.620> they<00:04:32.740> make<00:04:32.860> the

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:33.010 
balance things out so they make the

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:35.070 
balance things out so they make the
bullets<00:04:33.400> disappear<00:04:33.910> but<00:04:34.389> that's<00:04:34.870> not<00:04:35.020> a

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:35.080 
bullets disappear but that's not a

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:37.080 
bullets disappear but that's not a
problem<00:04:35.350> as<00:04:35.620> long<00:04:35.680> as<00:04:36.010> the<00:04:36.250> guns<00:04:36.699> do<00:04:36.880> enough

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:37.090 
problem as long as the guns do enough

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:39.360 
problem as long as the guns do enough
damage<00:04:37.120> and<00:04:37.540> have<00:04:37.630> enough<00:04:37.870> range<00:04:38.190> the<00:04:39.190> only

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:39.370 
damage and have enough range the only

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:41.219 
damage and have enough range the only
complaint<00:04:39.760> I<00:04:40.120> really<00:04:40.330> have<00:04:40.479> about<00:04:40.720> the

00:04:41.219 --> 00:04:41.229 
complaint I really have about the

00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:43.500 
complaint I really have about the
shotguns<00:04:41.650> in<00:04:41.740> this<00:04:41.860> game<00:04:42.070> is<00:04:42.250> that<00:04:42.520> most<00:04:43.330> of

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:43.510 
shotguns in this game is that most of

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:46.409 
shotguns in this game is that most of
the<00:04:43.630> shotguns<00:04:44.080> aren't<00:04:44.530> very<00:04:44.710> effective<00:04:45.419> until

00:04:46.409 --> 00:04:46.419 
the shotguns aren't very effective until

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:48.990 
the shotguns aren't very effective until
you<00:04:46.570> get<00:04:46.780> either<00:04:46.960> range<00:04:47.440> or<00:04:47.770> damage<00:04:47.800> and<00:04:48.430> both

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:49.000 
you get either range or damage and both

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.430 
you get either range or damage and both
of<00:04:49.030> these<00:04:49.240> take<00:04:49.540> a<00:04:49.570> very<00:04:49.810> long<00:04:49.870> time<00:04:50.139> to<00:04:50.199> get

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:50.440 
of these take a very long time to get

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:52.909 
of these take a very long time to get
and<00:04:50.680> you'll<00:04:50.949> see<00:04:51.190> right<00:04:51.340> here<00:04:51.520> assault<00:04:52.000> Moab
