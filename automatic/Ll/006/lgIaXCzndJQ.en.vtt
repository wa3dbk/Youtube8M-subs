tuning in looking to share a few things
are<00:00:24.119> too<00:00:24.300> about<00:00:24.830> organic<00:00:25.830> fertilizer<00:00:26.310> and

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
are too about organic fertilizer and

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.060 
are too about organic fertilizer and
conventional<00:00:27.480> fertilizer<00:00:27.930> we<00:00:28.859> take<00:00:29.039> no

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.100 
position I would say in my own garden I
tend<00:00:31.949> to<00:00:31.980> use<00:00:32.070> organic<00:00:32.369> /<00:00:32.880> synthetic<00:00:33.450> but<00:00:33.899> as<00:00:33.989> I

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
tend to use organic / synthetic but as I

tend to use organic / synthetic but as I
tell<00:00:34.350> my<00:00:34.469> customers<00:00:34.680> we<00:00:35.250> have<00:00:35.399> a<00:00:35.430> choice<00:00:35.670> and

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
tell my customers we have a choice and

tell my customers we have a choice and
the<00:00:36.780> way<00:00:36.870> I<00:00:36.899> look<00:00:37.170> at<00:00:37.320> it<00:00:37.489> organic<00:00:38.489> fertilizer

the way I look at it organic fertilizer

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.850 
the way I look at it organic fertilizer

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
little bit more biological process to

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.959 
little bit more biological process to

all around these are the most important

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.249 
all around these are the most important
nutrients<00:01:17.759> in<00:01:17.850> 17<00:01:18.420> that<00:01:18.570> a<00:01:18.630> plant<00:01:18.900> needs<00:01:19.080> to

things conventional you look at the bag

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.940 
things conventional you look at the bag
and<00:01:39.000> typically<00:01:39.390> there's<00:01:39.659> higher<00:01:39.900> numbers<00:01:40.439> in

this case you get more bang but it's

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.819 
this case you get more bang but it's
faster<00:01:51.149> to<00:01:51.180> respond<00:01:51.720> and<00:01:52.049> in<00:01:52.110> some<00:01:52.320> cases<00:01:52.560> of
