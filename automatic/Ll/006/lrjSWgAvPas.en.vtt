00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.160
 I 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.340
 those situations in which they may also fall into the definition of an ambush 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:12.800
 just casually 

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:16.660
 a fish arrives to catch a glimpse of the presence of the chupa 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.560
 weapons 

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:29.929

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:40.620
 1 lead back pack of 6 kilos 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.090
 worn with two shoulder straps as if it were a backpack 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:48.060
 the advantage is to split by ballast because otherwise it will be 

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:51.060
 concentrates completely around the life of the diver 

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:56.420
 placed on the back to back linux tends to lower the torso 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:00.660
 allowing you to take the most suitable position to be less visible with 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.660
 the body completely crushed on the po 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:22.980

 the posidonia meadows especially if occasionally interspersed with anthony 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:53.740
 dinozzo 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:56.920
 constitute a very suitable environment for practicing the star 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:01.400
 the fisherman must move just above posidonia 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.380
 in order to have a good vision 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:09.090
 when he sees a fish and you when his intuition suggests that it is possible 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:14.019
 interesting the diver sinks completely one proceeds with major 

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:15.009
 slowness 

00:02:15.009 --> 00:02:16.929
 you ascom charge 

00:02:16.929 --> 00:02:21.349
 in this way if you have moved in the maximum silence it is possible to get to 

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:24.349
 distance 

00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:41.229
 Bburago 

00:03:45.439 --> 00:03:51.870
 facebook I adore fault we usually practice photo depth 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:54.870
 undermining fish that are near life 

00:03:55.889 --> 00:04:00.269
 to cut the escape route a fish should turn towards the coast and 

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:04.279
 make routes that take us from the lake to the Libya where bangs 

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:08.879
 most of the fish is in the foam very quickly 

00:04:09.499 --> 00:04:14.309
 so it can be undermined from the bottom upwards by crawling along the boulders 

00:04:14.309 --> 00:04:17.309
 that from the bottom go back to the surface 

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:23.029
 orkut

 we are at sunset and our journey is also about to end 

00:05:00.949 --> 00:05:02.990
 But another snow will snow soon 

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:06.439
 because this is the magic of underwater fishing 

00:05:06.439 --> 00:05:10.689
 every time we find the sea it's a bit like it's the first time 

00:05:10.689 --> 00:05:15.929
 every catch that is different from all the others and every time the big is repeated 

00:05:15.929 --> 00:05:18.929
 thrill of underwater fishing 

00:05:40.779 --> 00:05:51.509
 there hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
