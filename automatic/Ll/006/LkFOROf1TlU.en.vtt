00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:22.730
 Hi, guys, I'm going to show you how to do 

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:29.650
 and how to make a porn video any 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:29.650
 glass breakable glass hop 

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:38.390
 the sensei 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:48.100
 and what we are going to use base in half a cup 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:51.460
 of water a cup of sugar and we have 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:56.079
 this also this and use 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:59.699
 what is called gray the gray as the 

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:59.699
 liquid glucose 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:07.479
 we're going to have to use liquid glucose 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:11.480
 but we can also replace it with 

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:14.870
 corn syrup that contain glucose 

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:16.730
 We're going to have to use 5 teaspoons of 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:19.820
 corn syrup 

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:22.960
 but if we find liquid glucose 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:25.370
 We are going to have to use 4 teaspoons 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.770
 this is because glucose is more 

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:30.380
 obviously concentrated and the syrup 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:33.979
 corn because it contains less 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:38.000
 and we're also going to have to use it separately 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:40.700
 oil a pan and ice to stir and 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.399
 Obviously when I say we pan 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:45.619
 have to use these so I'm going to 

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:48.560
 leave the ingredients down here together 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:50.770
 my social networks and let's start 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:54.189
 see how this is done 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:56.500
 well we are going to start here I have 

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:59.049
 the corn syrup can you tell me that 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:03.360
 be each time corn is also known 

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:08.030
 like baby syrup and here not 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:10.590
 over here it says glucose ingredients 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:13.950
 obviously it says a liquid thing but 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:17.900
 it is obvious that it is very good liquid we are going to 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.900
 start with the 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:26.200
 this way we're going to put half a cup 

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:30.150
 of water I'm using a quarter 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:32.890
 because I brought the wrong ones so put 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:36.040
 one 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:40.060
 the half cup of water we're going to 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:42.510
 boil and then we're going to move on 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.510
 others 

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:49.610
 very good since the water is hot 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:49.610
 let's pay him 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:55.500
 and we are going to add 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:55.500
 Sugar cup 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:04.739
 and the gray guesses 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.739
 I put a little in the microwave 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:11.840
 to be able to warn without problems 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:14.769
 and well now let's take this to 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.769
 our dirty three 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:21.840
 and we're going to start beating everything up 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:23.690
 dissolve not this was just a little 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:27.510
 boring but everything has to be 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:29.220
 totally willing to go they are taught 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:31.380
 how is it 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:37.440
 very good since everything has been dissolved 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:40.290
 let's leave it to simmer 8 to 10 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:43.440
 minutes and what I'm going to do to 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:46.880
 then will this option will 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:49.340
 I'm going to put the color 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:53.140
 what would be more 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:53.140
 and here comes everything 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:59.230
 and then this one 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:02.190
 with what the mixture boils we are going to 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:02.190
 Do other things 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:13.340
 and since we have we are going good since it is 

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:17.810
 there warming up boiling our 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:22.010
 mix let's grab 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:24.860
 the oil and you can do it with a 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:28.070
 kitchen brush or something you can 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:31.669
 spreading oil but like I do not have 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:35.419
 a kitchen brush for temporarily 

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:37.900
 let's grab I 'll put a little on 

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:37.900
 a napkin 

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:46.499
 and we're going to start filling all our 

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:48.139
 oil container to prevent it from 

00:04:46.499 --> 00:04:51.080
 stick 

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:53.370
 near you we will see what to do with 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:56.520
 mix 

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:59.400
 Well, another good way 

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:01.770
 let boil 8 to 10 minutes a 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:04.740
 way to know if the 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:08.030
 Kill some of the mixture and leave it 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:08.030
 fall into a glass with water 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:15.610
 the hysterical crime 

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:18.000
 then it stays hard down it means 

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:21.690
 that is ready 

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:24.630
 good this since he got hard in the 

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:29.070
 good water since the hard droplet was put 

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:31.610
 in the water because this one already washes 100 here 

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:31.610
 it's all 

00:05:32.139 --> 00:05:37.560
 and now what we are going to do is this 

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:40.689
 put it in the refrigerator or freezer 

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:43.360
 according to your preference 

00:05:40.689 --> 00:05:46.209
 it was not going to happen and I wanted to record as 

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:50.860
 empty and all that but as I am 

00:05:46.209 --> 00:05:54.009
 I was just going to be a good suicide mission already 

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:57.579
 it 's there we 're going to wait for an average 

00:05:54.009 --> 00:06:01.060
 hour or one hour depending on the time or 

00:05:57.579 --> 00:06:06.150
 power dura figuera dor 

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:06.150
 and I will show you how it is 

00:06:06.569 --> 00:06:12.050
 well I'm fine as you can see here 

00:06:08.999 --> 00:06:12.050
 already dry all 

00:06:12.289 --> 00:06:15.759
 let's accept it 

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:22.500
 and it is already 

00:06:23.849 --> 00:06:29.409
 it's colored but it's still 

00:06:27.169 --> 00:06:33.869
 transparent 

00:06:29.409 --> 00:06:33.869
 any colored glass would look like this 

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:44.160
 ok any color video would look like this 

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:47.640
 if we had done totally good without 

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:50.390
 color has been a bit opaque but 

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:50.390
 transparent 

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:55.349
 well, now with a 

00:06:52.139 --> 00:06:57.220
 napkin let's remove the excess 

00:06:55.349 --> 00:07:01.260
 fats 

00:06:57.220 --> 00:07:05.010
 and we 're done 

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:08.030
 with good and this is off little 

00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:08.030
 excess of grace 

00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:16.600
 and it 's totally edible 

00:07:19.289 --> 00:07:26.249
 but on the wheel 

00:07:21.729 --> 00:07:30.219
 what is white candy let's say it like that 

00:07:26.249 --> 00:07:31.660
 that this has been all in the ix write 

00:07:30.219 --> 00:07:34.710
 EC 

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:37.880
 and favorites them 

00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:37.880
 still attached mm
