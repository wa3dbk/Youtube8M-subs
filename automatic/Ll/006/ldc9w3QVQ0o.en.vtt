so when we started this a lot we wanted
to<00:00:06.299> make<00:00:06.450> a<00:00:06.480> game<00:00:06.720> that<00:00:06.750> is<00:00:07.020> in<00:00:07.200> kind<00:00:07.440> of<00:00:07.500> the

game that really give her a choice to

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:12.860 
game that really give her a choice to
the<00:00:11.250> paradigm<00:00:11.790> or<00:00:12.030> to<00:00:12.240> approach<00:00:12.540> the

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
situations and the goals they have to

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:15.919 
situations and the goals they have to
achieve<00:00:14.670> I<00:00:14.880> guess<00:00:15.120> you<00:00:15.240> think<00:00:15.360> that<00:00:15.540> changed

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
achieve I guess you think that changed

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:17.359 
achieve I guess you think that changed
the<00:00:16.020> most<00:00:16.199> since<00:00:16.379> the<00:00:16.680> beginning<00:00:17.010> is<00:00:17.160> the

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
the most since the beginning is the

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:19.279 
the most since the beginning is the
actual<00:00:17.789> world<00:00:18.060> and<00:00:18.300> the<00:00:18.449> visual<00:00:18.750> design<00:00:19.050> for

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
actual world and the visual design for

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.410 
actual world and the visual design for
the<00:00:19.380> game<00:00:19.560> we<00:00:20.520> don't<00:00:20.670> really<00:00:20.880> know<00:00:21.060> where<00:00:21.240> to

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
the game we don't really know where to

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.660 
the game we don't really know where to
go<00:00:21.779> when<00:00:21.900> we<00:00:22.050> start<00:00:22.320> it<00:00:22.470> and<00:00:22.619> take<00:00:23.010> it<00:00:23.400> took<00:00:23.640> a

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
go when we start it and take it took a

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.279 
go when we start it and take it took a
lot<00:00:23.820> of<00:00:23.850> time<00:00:24.119> like<00:00:24.359> brainstorming<00:00:25.050> and

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
lot of time like brainstorming and

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.050 
lot of time like brainstorming and
researches<00:00:26.070> and<00:00:26.160> all<00:00:26.279> that<00:00:26.460> who<00:00:26.670> really<00:00:26.699> get

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
researches and all that who really get

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.609 
researches and all that who really get
the<00:00:27.269> visual<00:00:27.720> sight<00:00:27.960> for<00:00:28.140> the<00:00:28.230> game<00:00:28.410> and

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
the visual sight for the game and

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.560 
the visual sight for the game and
actually<00:00:28.800> the<00:00:29.400> world<00:00:29.609> won't<00:00:29.789> keep<00:00:29.939> it<00:00:30.240> for<00:00:30.449> the

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
actually the world won't keep it for the

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.319 
actually the world won't keep it for the
game<00:00:30.750> which<00:00:31.740> we<00:00:31.890> started<00:00:32.189> in<00:00:32.250> suddenly<00:00:33.149> real

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
game which we started in suddenly real

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.240 
game which we started in suddenly real
war<00:00:33.540> like<00:00:33.750> real<00:00:33.960> London<00:00:34.110> and<00:00:34.860> little<00:00:35.100> by

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
war like real London and little by

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:36.740 
war like real London and little by
little<00:00:35.280> we<00:00:35.520> moved<00:00:35.850> away<00:00:36.000> from<00:00:36.180> the<00:00:36.450> real<00:00:36.600> world

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
little we moved away from the real world

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.110 
little we moved away from the real world
and<00:00:36.870> just<00:00:37.079> created<00:00:37.380> our<00:00:37.680> own<00:00:37.710> new<00:00:38.610> world<00:00:38.640> of

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
and just created our own new world of

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.910 
and just created our own new world of
fiction<00:00:39.329> we<00:00:39.840> can<00:00:39.989> do<00:00:40.110> pretty<00:00:40.500> much<00:00:40.590> what<00:00:40.829> you

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
fiction we can do pretty much what you

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:41.900 
fiction we can do pretty much what you
want<00:00:41.070> to<00:00:41.160> do<00:00:41.280> you<00:00:41.370> can<00:00:41.489> explore<00:00:41.760> different

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
want to do you can explore different

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.850 
want to do you can explore different
ideas<00:00:42.420> without<00:00:42.600> being<00:00:42.930> imitating<00:00:43.530> an

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
ideas without being imitating an

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.470 
ideas without being imitating an
imitated<00:00:44.430> by<00:00:44.579> things<00:00:44.879> we<00:00:45.000> did<00:00:45.120> in<00:00:45.239> the<00:00:45.329> past

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
imitated by things we did in the past

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.119 
imitated by things we did in the past
but<00:00:45.960> it's<00:00:46.170> also<00:00:46.320> more<00:00:46.500> complicated<00:00:46.739> because

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
but it's also more complicated because

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:48.799 
but it's also more complicated because
we<00:00:47.340> spent<00:00:47.610> like<00:00:47.820> alpha<00:00:48.180> the<00:00:48.300> project<00:00:48.660> trying

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
we spent like alpha the project trying

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.110 
we spent like alpha the project trying
to<00:00:48.930> understand<00:00:49.260> we<00:00:49.350> all<00:00:49.410> want<00:00:49.680> to<00:00:49.890> go<00:00:50.700> artists

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
to understand we all want to go artists

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.020 
to understand we all want to go artists
all<00:00:51.329> we<00:00:51.480> could<00:00:51.629> get<00:00:52.050> where<00:00:52.350> we<00:00:52.410> wanted<00:00:52.649> to<00:00:52.710> go

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:53.030 
all we could get where we wanted to go

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:55.069 
all we could get where we wanted to go
so<00:00:54.030> it's<00:00:54.120> been<00:00:54.239> a<00:00:54.270> lot<00:00:54.390> of<00:00:54.420> time<00:00:54.690> like<00:00:54.840> keep

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
so it's been a lot of time like keep

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:56.900 
so it's been a lot of time like keep
trying<00:00:55.469> things<00:00:55.710> and<00:00:56.039> trying<00:00:56.250> them<00:00:56.460> over<00:00:56.760> and

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
trying things and trying them over and

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.400 
trying things and trying them over and
over<00:00:57.000> until<00:00:57.270> we<00:00:57.449> get<00:00:57.539> the<00:00:57.690> result<00:00:57.989> we<00:00:58.109> wanted

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
over until we get the result we wanted

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.319 
over until we get the result we wanted
so<00:00:58.859> I<00:00:58.890> say<00:00:59.100> it's<00:00:59.250> both<00:00:59.520> challenging<00:01:00.210> and

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
so I say it's both challenging and

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.119 
so I say it's both challenging and
interesting<00:01:00.660> at<00:01:00.989> the<00:01:01.050> same<00:01:01.199> time<00:01:01.410> too<00:01:01.949> since

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
interesting at the same time too since

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:03.619 
interesting at the same time too since
the<00:01:02.280> temple<00:01:02.520> the<00:01:02.699> most<00:01:02.879> is<00:01:03.030> like<00:01:03.239> the<00:01:03.359> visual

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
the temple the most is like the visual

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:04.939 
the temple the most is like the visual
style<00:01:03.899> who<00:01:04.080> started<00:01:04.530> like<00:01:04.650> something

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
style who started like something

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.800 
style who started like something
realistic<00:01:05.369> and<00:01:05.790> is<00:01:05.880> really<00:01:06.119> good<00:01:06.630> to

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
realistic and is really good to

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.090 
realistic and is really good to
something<00:01:07.200> most<00:01:07.470> allies<00:01:07.830> like<00:01:08.040> the

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
something most allies like the

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.469 
something most allies like the
characters<00:01:08.610> you<00:01:08.760> can<00:01:08.880> see<00:01:09.000> that<00:01:09.150> like

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
characters you can see that like

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.679 
characters you can see that like
specific<00:01:10.140> proportions<00:01:11.330> in<00:01:12.330> terms<00:01:12.600> of

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
specific proportions in terms of

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.649 
specific proportions in terms of
gameplay<00:01:13.110> I<00:01:13.229> think<00:01:14.090> we<00:01:15.090> starting<00:01:15.360> looking<00:01:15.600> at

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
gameplay I think we starting looking at

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.330 
gameplay I think we starting looking at
the<00:01:15.750> game<00:01:15.900> in<00:01:16.020> time<00:01:16.110> of<00:01:16.259> stairs<00:01:16.530> with<00:01:16.770> him<00:01:17.040> as<00:01:17.280> a

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
the game in time of stairs with him as a

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.950 
the game in time of stairs with him as a

things<00:01:29.640> right<00:01:29.850> and<00:01:30.060> to<00:01:30.210> our<00:01:30.329> I<00:01:30.479> want<00:01:30.659> you<00:01:30.810> to<00:01:30.930> go

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
things right and to our I want you to go

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.870 
things right and to our I want you to go
I'm<00:01:31.740> just<00:01:31.799> trying<00:01:32.189> to<00:01:32.250> find<00:01:32.430> a<00:01:32.549> good<00:01:32.670> mix

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
I'm just trying to find a good mix

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.039 
I'm just trying to find a good mix
between<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.329> different<00:01:33.570> elements<00:01:33.630> of<00:01:33.990> the

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
between the different elements of the

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:35.960 
between the different elements of the
game<00:01:34.170> when<00:01:34.530> we<00:01:34.650> subsidies<00:01:35.130> or<00:01:35.250> not<00:01:35.369> we<00:01:35.579> knew

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
game when we subsidies or not we knew

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.280 
game when we subsidies or not we knew
that<00:01:36.119> it<00:01:36.240> would<00:01:36.390> be<00:01:36.420> difficult<00:01:36.780> to<00:01:37.049> lunch

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
that it would be difficult to lunch

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:38.929 
that it would be difficult to lunch
because<00:01:37.470> it's<00:01:37.740> a<00:01:37.799> new<00:01:37.920> IP<00:01:38.220> and<00:01:38.430> just<00:01:38.700> to<00:01:38.820> get

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
because it's a new IP and just to get

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.399 
because it's a new IP and just to get
bigger<00:01:39.210> interesting<00:01:39.479> new<00:01:39.810> things<00:01:40.079> is<00:01:40.200> kind<00:01:40.320> of

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
bigger interesting new things is kind of

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.380 
bigger interesting new things is kind of
hard<00:01:40.680> but<00:01:41.340> at<00:01:41.520> some<00:01:41.640> time<00:01:41.670> it<00:01:41.880> was<00:01:42.060> something

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
hard but at some time it was something

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.210 
hard but at some time it was something
we<00:01:42.659> want<00:01:42.960> to<00:01:43.020> do<00:01:43.229> just<00:01:43.259> to<00:01:43.590> bring<00:01:43.740> some<00:01:44.040> kind<00:01:44.130> of

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
we want to do just to bring some kind of

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.920 
we want to do just to bring some kind of
pressure<00:01:44.430> onto<00:01:44.759> the<00:01:44.970> market<00:01:45.299> into<00:01:45.600> the<00:01:45.720> games

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
pressure onto the market into the games

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.319 
pressure onto the market into the games
and<00:01:46.200> not<00:01:46.470> just<00:01:46.680> reducing<00:01:47.159> we<00:01:47.340> did<00:01:47.490> over<00:01:48.060> the

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
and not just reducing we did over the

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:49.940 
and not just reducing we did over the
past<00:01:48.360> years<00:01:48.780> and<00:01:48.930> I<00:01:49.320> think<00:01:49.380> it's<00:01:49.710> a<00:01:49.799> good

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
past years and I think it's a good

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.859 
past years and I think it's a good
timing<00:01:50.189> to<00:01:50.369> do<00:01:50.490> that<00:01:50.670> because<00:01:50.820> like<00:01:51.689> if<00:01:51.840> you

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
timing to do that because like if you

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.020 
timing to do that because like if you
the<00:01:52.590> lineup<00:01:52.740> freeze<00:01:53.189> for<00:01:53.460> this<00:01:53.579> year<00:01:53.790> it's<00:01:53.939> a

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
the lineup freeze for this year it's a

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.490 
the lineup freeze for this year it's a
lot<00:01:54.119> of<00:01:54.240> sequels<00:01:54.630> of<00:01:54.780> things<00:01:55.110> that<00:01:55.229> have<00:01:55.380> been

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
lot of sequels of things that have been

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.010 
lot of sequels of things that have been
already<00:01:55.860> done<00:01:56.009> three<00:01:56.670> or<00:01:56.700> four<00:01:57.000> times<00:01:57.149> so

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
already done three or four times so

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.569 
already done three or four times so
things<00:01:58.259> are<00:01:58.380> space<00:01:58.649> for<00:01:58.860> new<00:01:58.890> things<00:01:59.250> in<00:01:59.430> there

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
things are space for new things in there

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:00.580 
things are space for new things in there
and<00:01:59.729> I<00:01:59.820> hope

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
and I hope

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.069 
and I hope
like<00:02:01.070> that<00:02:01.220> for<00:02:01.820> the<00:02:01.970> casting<00:02:02.720> of<00:02:02.810> all<00:02:02.990> the

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:03.079 
like that for the casting of all the

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:05.050 
like that for the casting of all the
talents<00:02:03.439> for<00:02:03.560> the<00:02:03.740> voice<00:02:04.220> for<00:02:04.520> the<00:02:04.640> characters

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 
talents for the voice for the characters

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.350 
talents for the voice for the characters

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
feeling to the voice acting and it just

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.180 
feeling to the voice acting and it just
like<00:02:15.230> a<00:02:16.209> p-series<00:02:17.209> character<00:02:17.810> wherever<00:02:18.190> it's

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
like a p-series character wherever it's

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
something that's in the video game

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:21.850 
something that's in the video game
history<00:02:20.239> like<00:02:20.870> you<00:02:21.140> find<00:02:21.380> a<00:02:21.440> lot<00:02:21.560> of<00:02:21.680> game

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
history like you find a lot of game

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:23.050 
history like you find a lot of game
without<00:02:22.040> the<00:02:22.220> voice<00:02:22.400> acting<00:02:22.700> is<00:02:22.819> what<00:02:22.940> that

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
without the voice acting is what that

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:24.490 
without the voice acting is what that
would<00:02:23.269> really<00:02:23.540> looks<00:02:23.780> like<00:02:23.810> cartoony<00:02:24.380> or

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
would really looks like cartoony or

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.589 
would really looks like cartoony or
something<00:02:24.860> and<00:02:25.040> I<00:02:25.519> kind<00:02:25.790> of<00:02:25.819> detract<00:02:26.390> from<00:02:26.450> the

00:02:26.589 --> 00:02:26.599 
something and I kind of detract from the

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:27.820 
something and I kind of detract from the
experience<00:02:26.750> when<00:02:27.230> you<00:02:27.290> want<00:02:27.440> to<00:02:27.500> do<00:02:27.620> something

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
experience when you want to do something

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:29.530 
experience when you want to do something
where<00:02:28.160> people<00:02:28.340> really<00:02:28.819> get<00:02:28.940> involved<00:02:29.330> into

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
where people really get involved into

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.330 
where people really get involved into
the<00:02:29.750> story<00:02:30.019> and<00:02:30.140> all<00:02:30.260> that<00:02:30.410> so<00:02:31.130> it<00:02:31.190> was

the story and all that so it was

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:33.070 
the story and all that so it was
something<00:02:31.580> the<00:02:31.670> reporters<00:02:32.090> important<00:02:32.810> for<00:02:32.989> us

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080 
something the reporters important for us

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:34.690 
something the reporters important for us
to<00:02:33.200> make<00:02:33.290> sure<00:02:33.440> the<00:02:33.650> actors<00:02:33.920> were<00:02:34.310> kind<00:02:34.640> of

we do to give them this information

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.759 
we do to give them this information
whether<00:03:11.180> it's<00:03:11.420> tutorials<00:03:12.170> or<00:03:12.290> something<00:03:12.650> that

whether it's tutorials or something that
are<00:03:12.890> more<00:03:13.100> indirect<00:03:13.519> like<00:03:13.730> the<00:03:13.910> way<00:03:14.060> we<00:03:14.239> build

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:14.450 
are more indirect like the way we build

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:16.300 
are more indirect like the way we build
up<00:03:14.570> the<00:03:14.720> noodles<00:03:14.840> and<00:03:15.170> the<00:03:15.920> way<00:03:16.010> we<00:03:16.160> deliver

information who characters conversations
kind<00:03:19.040> of<00:03:19.100> things<00:03:19.280> so<00:03:19.549> it's<00:03:20.239> been<00:03:20.359> a<00:03:20.390> lot<00:03:20.480> of

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:20.540 
kind of things so it's been a lot of

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:22.150 
kind of things so it's been a lot of
iteration<00:03:21.109> to<00:03:21.260> get<00:03:21.410> to<00:03:21.560> that<00:03:21.650> point<00:03:21.890> where<00:03:22.100> our

players understand what they can do in

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:26.140 
players understand what they can do in
order<00:03:24.200> the<00:03:24.620> options<00:03:24.890> area<00:03:25.010> so<00:03:25.549> the<00:03:25.670> way<00:03:25.790> we<00:03:25.940> try

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.150 
order the options area so the way we try

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:27.490 
order the options area so the way we try
to<00:03:26.209> accommodate<00:03:26.780> all<00:03:26.900> the<00:03:26.989> options<00:03:27.290> the

actually so it's always some kind of

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:41.660 
actually so it's always some kind of
workaround<00:04:40.590> you<00:04:40.860> achieve<00:04:41.220> to<00:04:41.310> get<00:04:41.400> rid<00:04:41.610> of
