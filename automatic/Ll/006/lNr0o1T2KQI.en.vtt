00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.310 
wanted to build the deck based around
shared<00:01:44.579> discovery<00:01:44.970> and<00:01:45.180> so<00:01:45.689> what<00:01:45.899> better<00:01:46.049> way

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
shared discovery and so what better way

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:47.780 
shared discovery and so what better way
to<00:01:46.350> get<00:01:46.680> lots<00:01:46.860> of<00:01:47.070> creatures<00:01:47.250> out<00:01:47.549> that<00:01:47.729> you

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
to get lots of creatures out that you

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.580 
to get lots of creatures out that you
can<00:01:47.939> tap<00:01:48.180> and<00:01:48.420> draw<00:01:48.540> cards<00:01:48.869> with<00:01:49.020> then<00:01:49.290> things

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
can tap and draw cards with then things

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.679 
can tap and draw cards with then things
that<00:01:49.770> make<00:01:49.920> spawn<00:01:50.220> like<00:01:50.759> nest<00:01:51.180> invader<00:01:51.509> and

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
that make spawn like nest invader and

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.260 
that make spawn like nest invader and
cause<00:01:52.530> Lex<00:01:52.770> predator<00:01:53.130> which<00:01:53.340> basically<00:01:53.729> turns

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
cause Lex predator which basically turns

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.810 
cause Lex predator which basically turns
on<00:01:54.509> shared<00:01:54.840> discovery<00:01:55.170> by<00:01:55.290> himself<00:01:55.590> so<00:01:56.219> as<00:01:56.520> I

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
on shared discovery by himself so as I

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.940 
on shared discovery by himself so as I
was<00:01:57.060> putting<00:01:57.360> these<00:01:57.570> together<00:01:57.750> what's<00:01:58.680> a<00:01:58.799> good

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
was putting these together what's a good

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.880 
was putting these together what's a good
way<00:01:59.130> to<00:01:59.610> abuse<00:02:00.149> the<00:02:00.299> spawn<00:02:00.890> there's

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
way to abuse the spawn there's

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.280 
way to abuse the spawn there's

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
of interesting yeah so about the

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.190 
of interesting yeah so about the
sideboard<00:03:50.670> here<00:03:50.880> we<00:03:51.630> have<00:03:51.720> another<00:03:51.810> Beast

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200 
sideboard here we have another Beast

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:53.780 
sideboard here we have another Beast
Within<00:03:52.410> beasts<00:03:52.920> within<00:03:53.160> that<00:03:53.459> you<00:03:53.550> can<00:03:53.670> bring

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
Within beasts within that you can bring

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:54.770 
Within beasts within that you can bring
if<00:03:54.000> your<00:03:54.150> opponent<00:03:54.300> has<00:03:54.480> lots<00:03:54.690> of

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:08.430 
too thrilled in the side where this is

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:10.460 
too thrilled in the side where this is
mostly<00:04:08.790> a<00:04:08.880> remnant<00:04:09.120> from<00:04:09.300> when<00:04:09.690> Cobb<00:04:09.959> laid<00:04:10.230> was

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
mostly a remnant from when Cobb laid was

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:12.500 
mostly a remnant from when Cobb laid was
everywhere<00:04:10.950> and<00:04:11.610> you<00:04:11.760> needed<00:04:12.060> to<00:04:12.180> have<00:04:12.269> some

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510 
everywhere and you needed to have some

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:15.259 
everywhere and you needed to have some
way<00:04:12.600> to<00:04:12.630> deal<00:04:12.840> with<00:04:12.870> batter<00:04:13.140> skull<00:04:13.410> but<00:04:14.310> now<00:04:15.239> I

00:04:15.259 --> 00:04:15.269 
way to deal with batter skull but now I

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:17.360 
way to deal with batter skull but now I
think<00:04:15.959> we<00:04:16.140> should<00:04:16.320> take<00:04:16.410> them<00:04:16.620> out<00:04:16.739> yeah<00:04:17.100> I

think we should take them out yeah I
don't<00:04:17.669> think<00:04:18.000> they're<00:04:18.180> really<00:04:18.299> doing

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:18.600 
don't think they're really doing

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:21.090 
don't think they're really doing
anything<00:04:18.930> anymore<00:04:19.650> because

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:21.100
