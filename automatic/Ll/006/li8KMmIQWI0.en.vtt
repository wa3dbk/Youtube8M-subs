00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:06.250
 the more than 50 thousand spectators had to be right from the beginning 

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:09.669
 Schalke presents itself offensively 

00:00:09.669 --> 00:00:12.119
 Post shot goals 

00:00:12.119 --> 00:00:14.729
 Sweden had Andersen and Osten are for an international match 

00:00:14.729 --> 00:00:18.619
 Schalke had to give up if Lafontaine has Helmut Kremers the 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:21.619
 Prerequisites were about the same 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:26.989
 the 1 0 by Klaus Fischer the eleventh minute as there is no conclusion 

00:00:26.989 --> 00:00:30.429
 the sensational course of this game too 

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:33.429
 the first fisherman hits in slow motion 

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:43.160
 But then decisive events Bayern Munich still has a goalkeeper 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:47.280
 of bundesliga goalkeeper namely Sepp Maier ever the player blanket of 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.060
 Munich is far too thin and Sepp Maier became serious in this scene 

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:51.780
 injured 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.449
 my teammates 

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:56.449
 but he still had to play 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:02.950
 a quick equalization in a game is the turn of the game, it is idle too 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:07.550
 speculate what would have happened Data Gerd Müller the 1 1 scored the chance 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:10.370
 offered himself 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:13.790
 where, on the other hand, the man Dr Gerd Müller was the player type most 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:16.440
 resembles Schalke center forward Klaus Fischer 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:19.280
 you have to design that his direct opponent Georg Schwarzenbeck 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.390
 was handicapped by an injury experienced in the international match against Ried 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:27.620
 Gescher was the towering player in the Schalke Sturm two examples of the 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:30.580
 Danger of the man because of his involvement in the 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:33.750
 Bundesliga scandal for the national team is still not in 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.050
 question 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:40.170
 a minute before the break then this too is an important factor in the 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.180
 Assessment during the game Schalke 04 was able to make his lead at 2 10 pm 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:45.480
 on 

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:48.480
 Bongard and Erwin Kremers threatened 

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:53.020
 Bayern Munich changed to the break Schwarzenbeck 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:56.220
 Horstmann received the new job of getting fishermen 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:59.220
 but also man remained hapless 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.470
 the 13th 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:06.650
 by Fischer just one minute after the restart 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:09.349
 There are games in which everything runs optimally 

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:12.499
 That's why this encounter in Munich certainly belonged to such games 

00:02:13.039 --> 00:02:16.110
 so almost all bayern-boss stayed in the second part 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.110
 get almost everything on 2 Watt Norwich the area around in the devices 

00:02:20.619 --> 00:02:23.789
 Bayern coach Dettmar Cramer had to confess after the game that his 

00:02:23.789 --> 00:02:26.409
 Team had been outclassed by Schalke today 

00:02:26.409 --> 00:02:30.619
 and Munich does not seem to work very hard this season anyway 

00:02:30.619 --> 00:02:34.759
 had to continue to let the animal back through Dubsky in the 64th 

00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:37.609
 minute 

00:02:37.609 --> 00:02:40.249
 another reason for Schalke's superiority was that 

00:02:40.249 --> 00:02:43.439
 more heavily occupied midfield of the former coach Max Merkel one 

00:02:43.439 --> 00:02:46.699
 deprecating had said that his train had come 

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:47.799
 the 15 0 

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:49.579
 in the 67th minute 

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:51.599
 and this business was worth it 

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:54.599
 to be repeated 

00:03:06.409 --> 00:03:10.389
 Bongard and Abramczik the towering midfielders and Rüdiger Brands 

00:03:10.389 --> 00:03:14.799
 Inc today's good performances on a goal completion in March 

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:17.379
 74 minutes change 

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:20.439
 the chronology of the highest consecration defeat from its closing point in the 

00:03:20.439 --> 00:03:21.979
 82 minutes 

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:25.449
 Schalke 04 took the first away spot of the season for one 

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:28.439
 sensational victory in Munich, of all places 

00:03:28.439 --> 00:03:32.170
 the seven to zero so 8 minutes before the end of the scorers again 

00:03:32.169 --> 00:03:34.239
 Klaus Fischer 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:36.940
 and Schalke coach Friedel Rausch News agencies 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:38.899
 should never be so fast after the game 

00:03:38.899 --> 00:03:40.319
 to the press conference
