00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.569 
join me here for the tutorial okay here
it<00:02:02.340> is<00:02:02.490> guys<00:02:02.700> the<00:02:03.210> paper<00:02:03.509> cup<00:02:03.869> really<00:02:04.710> really

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
it is guys the paper cup really really

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:08.660 
it is guys the paper cup really really
simple<00:02:06.000> all<00:02:06.240> you<00:02:06.990> have<00:02:07.140> to<00:02:07.290> do<00:02:07.409> is<00:02:07.649> fold<00:02:08.069> corner

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
simple all you have to do is fold corner

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:14.330 
simple all you have to do is fold corner
to<00:02:09.030> corner<00:02:09.270> and<00:02:09.780> make<00:02:10.379> a<00:02:10.410> crease

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:18.090 

then<00:02:15.340> you're<00:02:16.210> going<00:02:16.360> to<00:02:16.450> gauge<00:02:16.750> with<00:02:17.560> both

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:18.100 
then you're going to gauge with both

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:20.460 
then you're going to gauge with both
sides<00:02:18.430> pick<00:02:18.760> them<00:02:18.910> up<00:02:19.060> like<00:02:19.240> this<00:02:19.480> and<00:02:19.780> then

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470 
sides pick them up like this and then

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:25.140 
sides pick them up like this and then
find<00:02:20.920> a<00:02:21.220> spot<00:02:21.280> that's<00:02:22.030> just<00:02:22.480> about<00:02:23.260> even<00:02:24.220> so

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
find a spot that's just about even so

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:28.680 
find a spot that's just about even so
you<00:02:25.210> want<00:02:25.540> this<00:02:26.260> edge<00:02:26.560> and<00:02:26.890> this<00:02:27.880> edge<00:02:28.150> to<00:02:28.210> be

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
you want this edge and this edge to be

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:30.960 
you want this edge and this edge to be
about<00:02:29.050> the<00:02:29.410> same<00:02:29.650> doesn't<00:02:30.610> have<00:02:30.700> to<00:02:30.850> be

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
about the same doesn't have to be

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:33.120 
about the same doesn't have to be
perfect<00:02:31.480> this<00:02:31.660> is<00:02:31.720> a<00:02:31.840> very<00:02:32.140> forgiving<00:02:32.740> model

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.130 
perfect this is a very forgiving model

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:36.540 
perfect this is a very forgiving model
but<00:02:33.970> as<00:02:34.240> long<00:02:34.480> as<00:02:34.600> it's<00:02:34.750> close<00:02:35.050> and<00:02:35.620> then<00:02:36.100> you

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:36.550 
but as long as it's close and then you

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:39.300 
but as long as it's close and then you
make<00:02:36.760> a<00:02:36.790> crease<00:02:37.560> again<00:02:38.560> you're<00:02:39.280> just

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
make a crease again you're just

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:41.190 
make a crease again you're just
overlapping<00:02:40.060> the<00:02:40.330> two<00:02:40.360> sides<00:02:40.780> and<00:02:41.050> they'll

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 
overlapping the two sides and they'll

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.320 
overlapping the two sides and they'll
tell<00:02:41.590> they're<00:02:41.740> pretty<00:02:41.980> much<00:02:42.160> equal<00:02:42.550> and<00:02:42.790> then

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:43.330 
tell they're pretty much equal and then

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:48.990 
tell they're pretty much equal and then
making<00:02:43.540> a<00:02:43.690> crease<00:02:45.120> now<00:02:46.120> if<00:02:46.950> you<00:02:47.950> look<00:02:48.520> at<00:02:48.700> these

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
making a crease now if you look at these

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.390 
making a crease now if you look at these
flaps<00:02:49.480> the<00:02:49.960> top<00:02:50.200> flap<00:02:50.500> made<00:02:50.920> a<00:02:50.950> little<00:02:51.250> pocket

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
flaps the top flap made a little pocket
