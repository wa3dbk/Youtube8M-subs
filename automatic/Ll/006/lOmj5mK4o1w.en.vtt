be one here now welcome back to a video
where<00:00:03.959> we<00:00:04.080> are<00:00:04.350> going<00:00:04.410> to<00:00:04.710> be<00:00:04.799> testing<00:00:05.250> my<00:00:05.430> new

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:05.460 
where we are going to be testing my new

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.259 
where we are going to be testing my new
gtx<00:00:06.210> 760<00:00:06.839> s<00:00:06.899> in<00:00:07.049> sli<00:00:07.560> now<00:00:08.429> I<00:00:08.460> do<00:00:08.639> have<00:00:08.910> my

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
gtx 760 s in sli now I do have my

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:11.360 
gtx 760 s in sli now I do have my
battlefield<00:00:10.170> 4<00:00:10.440> set<00:00:10.679> all<00:00:10.800> the<00:00:10.889> way<00:00:10.950> to<00:00:11.010> ultra

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
battlefield 4 set all the way to ultra

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.820 
battlefield 4 set all the way to ultra
but<00:00:11.880> if<00:00:11.940> you<00:00:12.000> do<00:00:12.120> notice<00:00:12.360> it's<00:00:12.570> on<00:00:12.660> 2560<00:00:13.320> x<00:00:13.410> 1440

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
but if you do notice it's on 2560 x 1440

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:15.680 
but if you do notice it's on 2560 x 1440
so<00:00:14.280> the<00:00:14.429> performance<00:00:15.059> might<00:00:15.269> not<00:00:15.450> be<00:00:15.599> exactly

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
so the performance might not be exactly

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.380 
so the performance might not be exactly
what<00:00:16.170> to<00:00:16.260> expect<00:00:16.289> but<00:00:16.830> um<00:00:17.039> on<00:00:17.310> ultra<00:00:18.210> with<00:00:18.330> the

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
what to expect but um on ultra with the

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.050 
what to expect but um on ultra with the
regular<00:00:18.720> to<00:00:18.869> buy<00:00:18.990> average<00:00:19.350> about<00:00:19.529> 60<00:00:20.160> FPS<00:00:20.609> are

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
regular to buy average about 60 FPS are

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.330 
regular to buy average about 60 FPS are

works out here so we're getting about 50
40<00:00:35.180> i'm<00:00:36.180> gonna<00:00:36.840> guess<00:00:37.079> we're<00:00:37.200> gonna<00:00:37.260> get<00:00:37.469> an

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
40 i'm gonna guess we're gonna get an

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.470 
40 i'm gonna guess we're gonna get an
average<00:00:37.620> about<00:00:37.950> 40<00:00:38.250> to<00:00:38.370> 45<00:00:38.550> FPS<00:00:39.120> during<00:00:39.360> this

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
average about 40 to 45 FPS during this

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.350 
average about 40 to 45 FPS during this
game<00:00:39.540> play<00:00:39.930> um<00:00:40.290> I<00:00:41.040> don't<00:00:41.730> really<00:00:41.820> notice<00:00:42.120> any

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:39.350 
is running at a 59 so the first one is

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:41.469 
is running at a 59 so the first one is
doing<00:01:39.530> of<00:01:39.799> course<00:01:39.830> more<00:01:40.250> work<00:01:40.430> and<00:01:41.000> the<00:01:41.149> second

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:41.479 
doing of course more work and the second

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:44.280 
doing of course more work and the second
one<00:01:41.570> which<00:01:41.780> is<00:01:41.810> normal

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:44.290 
one which is normal

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:47.740 
one which is normal
just<00:01:45.790> Pleasant<00:01:46.790> gameplay<00:01:47.149> I<00:01:47.180> haven't<00:01:47.630> run

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:47.750 
just Pleasant gameplay I haven't run

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.789 
just Pleasant gameplay I haven't run
into<00:01:47.899> any<00:01:47.960> problems<00:01:48.290> I<00:01:48.680> haven't<00:01:48.950> run<00:01:49.070> into<00:01:49.250> any

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:50.799 
into any problems I haven't run into any

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:52.960 
into any problems I haven't run into any
so<00:01:51.799> I<00:01:51.829> just<00:01:52.100> it<00:01:52.250> just<00:01:52.399> runs<00:01:52.579> perfectly

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:52.970 
so I just it just runs perfectly

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:55.840 
so I just it just runs perfectly
basically<00:01:53.390> so<00:01:53.570> if<00:01:54.470> you<00:01:54.649> do<00:01:54.770> have<00:01:54.979> 17<00:01:55.399> 16<00:01:55.670> you

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:55.850 
basically so if you do have 17 16 you

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:57.389 
basically so if you do have 17 16 you
just<00:01:56.000> think<00:01:56.149> it's<00:01:56.240> not<00:01:56.329> cutting<00:01:56.630> it<00:01:56.750> enough<00:01:56.960> I

00:01:57.389 --> 00:01:57.399 
just think it's not cutting it enough I

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:00.279 
just think it's not cutting it enough I
if<00:01:58.399> you're<00:01:58.610> playing<00:01:58.789> 1080p<00:01:59.420> you<00:01:59.780> will<00:01:59.990> always

basically<00:04:12.870> it<00:04:13.110> um<00:04:14.390> as<00:04:15.390> I<00:04:15.569> say<00:04:15.720> the<00:04:15.870> two<00:04:16.019> cars

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:16.260 
basically it um as I say the two cars

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.069 
basically it um as I say the two cars
they<00:04:16.590> are<00:04:16.620> overclocked<00:04:17.310> I<00:04:17.900> believe<00:04:18.900> they're

00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:19.079 
they are overclocked I believe they're

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:21.349 
they are overclocked I believe they're
both<00:04:19.230> the<00:04:19.709> core<00:04:19.919> clock<00:04:20.190> sir<00:04:20.430> overclocked<00:04:21.030> 100

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:21.359 
both the core clock sir overclocked 100

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:23.990 
both the core clock sir overclocked 100
megahertz<00:04:21.630> on<00:04:21.900> each<00:04:22.109> of<00:04:22.260> them<00:04:22.470> so<00:04:23.430> that's<00:04:23.820> a

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.000 
megahertz on each of them so that's a

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.390 
megahertz on each of them so that's a
pretty<00:04:24.720> pretty<00:04:25.169> nice<00:04:25.380> overclock<00:04:25.860> I<00:04:26.100> would<00:04:26.220> say

pretty pretty nice overclock I would say

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.720 
pretty pretty nice overclock I would say

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:28.730 
the memory is also overclocked on them

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:33.170
