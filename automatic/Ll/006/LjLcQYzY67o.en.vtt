00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:04.120
 but can't wait for a merger, but now it's a little later time for the radio 

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:07.280
 can be heard how nice to roam 

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:09.979
 is going to be called March almost a week ago 

00:00:09.979 --> 00:00:11.169
 it will do 

00:00:11.169 --> 00:00:14.169
 when he invariably stepped forward from his store 

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:18.049
 the bottom of the bar 

00:00:20.239 --> 00:00:23.239
 but why not year resolved 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:25.859
 london anp robert kubica 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.199
 walter de buck discusses today he permanently fronts 

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:32.420
 I said on behalf of 

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:34.460
 all the way 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.460
 and I have to remain so indignant 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.400
 became second 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:46.880
 I have understood the larger part darker and novum francs 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.240
 the brother man from wolfheze 

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:52.410
 a book with 50 rapper goes 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.850
 but where did stories about animals happen, such as an it is against it? 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.650
 a plane and and the horses that could predict the future of the car 50 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:03.680
 very nice story to be in this book 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:05.850
 at an auction 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.990
 He ran the dog that was just there in the studio but that was such a dog that by 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:11.400
 the chord was eaten icesave 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.400
 in the blue zone i have to change once 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.010
 you can't stay at home in london 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:19.100
 Finally you loved the book 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:20.200
 yes there is 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.610
 I've got the most ghost falls 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.610
 he was all sorry 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:31.740
 a lot of tapas did you think you can turn 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.700
 to experience somewhat more credible zoom 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.160
 a vision that function 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:38.720
 You don't believe that 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.850
 I believe then I just placed around the panels 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.000
 because I have a chain by the way 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.580
 but I read again, I thought 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:48.910
 all stories are real 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:54.390
 all leave is indeed happening the dutch we 5 april back 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.320
 newspapers and magazines 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:00.570
 never mind an intended bid of nine million residents went in barcelona 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.790
 multiple sources because that is quite an honor 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.900
 added to the stories by doing the research 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:08.499
 to send in the pre-selection 

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:10.919
 and then ultimately also check whether they were 

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:13.669
 to be freaky what is all about one 

00:02:13.669 --> 00:02:16.669
 or a man who is a cat and mouse of these people at that time 

00:02:17.559 --> 00:02:22.199
 Stosur himself said the minister will rise to 10 percent in the short term 

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:24.809
 district in that way lead the white house 

00:02:24.809 --> 00:02:25.790
 we found it 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:28.289
 the story turned out to be the man 

00:02:28.289 --> 00:02:31.329
 our possessions 

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:33.279
 we have to live yes indeed 

00:02:33.279 --> 00:02:36.279
 yes you can notice that the two stars are written 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:41.739
 no she didn't say no this is a completely different one 

00:02:42.839 --> 00:02:46.329
 After all, something funny Rhine land probably doesn't make sense 

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:49.329
 Then you get wax again since April 30 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:53.709
 yes i think that would mean a typical park is another 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:56.709
 I have you ask him 

00:02:58.729 --> 00:03:00.669
 this is correct in principle 

00:03:00.669 --> 00:03:03.669
 I do not know 

00:03:05.439 --> 00:03:08.879
 as ireland help with searching, women already had a few books for it 

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:09.989
 written together 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:13.209
 a bit harder than that from both sides with a tip at papendal 

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:18.209
 Then we cannot place citizens in Rotterdam already reached 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:20.279
 for an attractive 

00:03:20.279 --> 00:03:21.999
 year before 

00:03:21.999 --> 00:03:23.339
 no almere 

00:03:23.339 --> 00:03:26.119
 stories about animals 

00:03:26.119 --> 00:03:29.879
 I think I would have liked to have read everything myself before 

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:33.049
 I think that is a benchmark for an action that he used to ask himself 

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:33.859
 wondering 

00:03:33.859 --> 00:03:36.859
 I never put myself together like everywhere else in the past 

00:03:37.559 --> 00:03:39.939
 that's why we will be both the teams that we 

00:03:39.939 --> 00:03:43.419
 Even the council will make a profit that is a good one they are also the only way to not 

00:03:43.419 --> 00:03:44.989
 see for yourself that the world 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:47.899
 the boys 

00:03:47.899 --> 00:03:50.899
 a parakeet is allowed but I just had a little snow 

00:03:55.669 --> 00:03:56.550
 the news and the morning 

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:57.529
 zierikzee 

00:03:57.529 --> 00:04:00.900
 it is a blessing to stop that 50 meter high statue of Christ 

00:04:02.749 --> 00:04:04.249
 he goes soooooo 

00:04:04.249 --> 00:04:07.169
 a year earlier 

00:04:07.169 --> 00:04:12.569
 thank you guys who come from france you were the one 

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:14.719
 create a place and when you come 

00:04:14.719 --> 00:04:18.549
 was at home have a ticket for the strike of five days employees 

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:20.689
 and while
