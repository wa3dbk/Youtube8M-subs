00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.210
 oh yes liu everyone is oryxa 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.070
 of today we find ourselves for 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:20.400
 new video a video bleach and 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:23.550
 how to move forward with a map without 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.930
 So I'm not coming 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.320
 commented today I do not know what 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.820
 I happen 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.650
 we may be for different 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.939
 reasons that I did not sleep but 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.380
 so I was immediately started 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.510
 glitchs then I take a block of 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.840
 diamond but you can from a block of 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.290
 diamond applaud me thank you that's me 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.850
 pleases 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:43.290
 I take a blog of gold that's because 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.270
 it's more stylish you can take 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.829
 any block but it's more 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.200
 stylized it's more classy with 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:52.020
 the shader this pack so then there you 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.820
 will need rails because otherwise it will not 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.680
 will not walk and yes it's just as 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:01:00.059
 simple that you put them like that 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:01.230
 you do not put any here and so then 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.760
 what you are going to do is that you 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.470
 go put seamine card 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:11.760
 so we will count together for those 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:14.549
 who can not count 1 2 3 4 5 6 shit 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.470

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.880

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:23.820

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.350
 and then thank you then everything you 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:32.430
 have to do is take off that shit 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:35.430
 of course it has the edge 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.740
 alas once you are here there is 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.390

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:44.399

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:47.220

 completely nil then the only thing 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:09.260
