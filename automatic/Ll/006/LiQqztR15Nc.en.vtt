00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
steps the balance is always three things

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.170 
steps the balance is always three things
in<00:00:38.969> general<00:00:39.390> it's<00:00:39.809> the<00:00:40.309> it's<00:00:41.309> creating<00:00:42.090> a

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
in general it's the it's creating a

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.290 
in general it's the it's creating a
group<00:00:42.420> and<00:00:42.860> you<00:00:43.860> create<00:00:44.190> a<00:00:44.219> group<00:00:44.460> during<00:00:45.120> the

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
group and you create a group during the

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.750 
group and you create a group during the
whole<00:00:45.450> day<00:00:45.660> with<00:00:46.370> having<00:00:47.370> dinner<00:00:47.550> together

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:04.220 
the pitch the ideas that we want that

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:07.550 
the pitch the ideas that we want that
yeah<00:01:05.220> that<00:01:05.400> the<00:01:05.519> players<00:01:05.790> understand<00:01:06.780> more

yeah that the players understand more

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.460 
yeah that the players understand more
and<00:01:07.619> more<00:01:07.890> and<00:01:08.130> of<00:01:09.090> course<00:01:09.119> then<00:01:09.570> you<00:01:09.960> get

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
and more and of course then you get

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.429 
and more and of course then you get
let's<00:01:11.070> say<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.580> games<00:01:12.000> where<00:01:12.810> you<00:01:12.990> want<00:01:13.320> to

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
let's say the games where you want to

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:16.219 
let's say the games where you want to
see<00:01:13.650> the<00:01:13.830> things<00:01:14.070> that<00:01:14.280> you<00:01:14.430> work<00:01:14.640> on<00:01:15.229> during

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
see the things that you work on during

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.260 
see the things that you work on during
the<00:01:16.350> week<00:01:16.500> during<00:01:16.979> the<00:01:17.159> day<00:01:17.340> daily<00:01:17.759> practice

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
the week during the day daily practice

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.149 
the week during the day daily practice
that<00:01:18.509> you<00:01:18.630> try<00:01:18.840> to<00:01:18.900> see<00:01:19.200> those<00:01:19.380> things<00:01:19.710> coming

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
that you try to see those things coming

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.600 
that you try to see those things coming
back<00:01:20.509> so<00:01:21.509> I<00:01:21.540> think<00:01:21.990> those<00:01:22.799> three<00:01:23.040> things<00:01:23.310> are

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
back so I think those three things are

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.929 
back so I think those three things are
the<00:01:24.479> most<00:01:24.659> important<00:01:25.170> things<00:01:25.220> group<00:01:26.220> training

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
the most important things group training

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.840 
the most important things group training
games<00:01:27.299> and<00:01:28.070> and<00:01:29.070> I<00:01:29.159> think<00:01:29.189> that<00:01:29.490> worked<00:01:29.700> out

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
games and and I think that worked out

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:35.679 
games and and I think that worked out
very<00:01:29.909> well<00:01:30.240> movie<00:01:30.960> n

how your exam here you're learning in

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.879 
how your exam here you're learning in

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:51.889 
the games there every time in exam do

00:02:51.889 --> 00:02:55.000 
the games there every time in exam do
you<00:02:52.010> pass<00:02:52.280> the<00:02:52.459> exam<00:02:52.849> you<00:02:53.329> have<00:02:53.359> a<00:02:53.989> good<00:02:54.799> note

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
you pass the exam you have a good note

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:56.979 
you pass the exam you have a good note
or<00:02:55.370> is<00:02:55.670> your<00:02:55.819> note<00:02:56.060> not<00:02:56.299> that<00:02:56.480> good<00:02:56.659> and<00:02:56.900> you

00:02:56.979 --> 00:02:56.989 
or is your note not that good and you

00:02:56.989 --> 00:02:59.289 
or is your note not that good and you
have<00:02:57.139> to<00:02:57.319> do<00:02:57.620> the<00:02:57.769> exam<00:02:58.099> again<00:02:58.370> so<00:02:59.150> I<00:02:59.180> think

00:02:59.289 --> 00:02:59.299 
have to do the exam again so I think

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:01.920 
have to do the exam again so I think
it's<00:02:59.840> very<00:03:00.109> difficult<00:03:00.379> for<00:03:00.680> people<00:03:01.220> outside

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
it's very difficult for people outside

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:05.679 
it's very difficult for people outside
to<00:03:02.930> stew<00:03:03.500> to<00:03:03.980> see<00:03:04.280> and<00:03:04.609> to<00:03:04.790> know<00:03:04.970> what<00:03:05.239> we<00:03:05.540> are

00:03:05.679 --> 00:03:05.689 
to stew to see and to know what we are

00:03:05.689 --> 00:03:07.679 
to stew to see and to know what we are
doing<00:03:05.840> here<00:03:06.019> because<00:03:06.590> they're<00:03:06.950> not<00:03:07.099> here<00:03:07.430> and

00:03:07.679 --> 00:03:07.689 
doing here because they're not here and

00:03:07.689 --> 00:03:15.250 
doing here because they're not here and
for<00:03:08.689> them<00:03:08.840> the<00:03:09.049> only<00:03:09.169> references<00:03:10.010> the<00:03:10.609> games

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:19.070 

no<00:03:16.260> I<00:03:16.680> don't<00:03:16.890> think<00:03:16.950> so<00:03:17.480> if<00:03:18.480> you<00:03:18.659> look<00:03:18.810> at<00:03:18.959> the

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:19.080 
no I don't think so if you look at the

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.020 
no I don't think so if you look at the
players<00:03:19.319> who<00:03:19.560> were<00:03:19.680> injured<00:03:19.890> they're<00:03:20.790> coming

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
players who were injured they're coming

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.809 
players who were injured they're coming
back<00:03:21.330> like<00:03:22.260> heck<00:03:22.470> tonight<00:03:22.799> right<00:03:23.190> now<00:03:23.340> so<00:03:23.580> he

00:03:23.809 --> 00:03:23.819 
back like heck tonight right now so he

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:27.199 
back like heck tonight right now so he
came<00:03:24.000> here<00:03:24.420> with<00:03:24.569> still<00:03:25.080> almost<00:03:25.799> all<00:03:26.190> with<00:03:27.030> his

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:27.209 
came here with still almost all with his

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:30.649 
came here with still almost all with his
crutches<00:03:27.510> and<00:03:27.930> now<00:03:28.650> he's<00:03:28.980> training<00:03:29.819> he's<00:03:30.060> I

00:03:30.649 --> 00:03:30.659 
crutches and now he's training he's I

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:34.699 
crutches and now he's training he's I
think<00:03:31.310> almost<00:03:32.310> completely<00:03:33.060> fit<00:03:33.470> next<00:03:34.470> week

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
think almost completely fit next week

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:36.559 
think almost completely fit next week
when<00:03:34.890> we're<00:03:35.040> back<00:03:35.129> in<00:03:35.190> Guadalajara<00:03:35.819> he<00:03:36.390> can

00:03:36.559 --> 00:03:36.569 
when we're back in Guadalajara he can

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:39.830 
when we're back in Guadalajara he can
join<00:03:36.750> the<00:03:37.079> training<00:03:37.890> sessions<00:03:38.299> so<00:03:39.299> all<00:03:39.690> the

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
join the training sessions so all the

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:43.789 
join the training sessions so all the
other<00:03:39.959> players<00:03:40.200> are<00:03:40.560> our<00:03:41.129> fit<00:03:42.170> that<00:03:43.170> I<00:03:43.409> think<00:03:43.709> a

00:03:43.789 --> 00:03:43.799 
other players are our fit that I think a

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:46.640 
other players are our fit that I think a
very<00:03:44.040> good<00:03:44.250> sign<00:03:44.519> that<00:03:44.760> the<00:03:45.170> has<00:03:46.170> been<00:03:46.379> worked

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
very good sign that the has been worked

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.979 
very good sign that the has been worked
very<00:03:46.890> hard<00:03:47.010> that<00:03:47.609> we<00:03:47.790> don't<00:03:47.910> have<00:03:48.209> injuries

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:48.989 
very hard that we don't have injuries

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:50.780 
very hard that we don't have injuries

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040 
players to get into the team and I think

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:15.880 
players to get into the team and I think
that's<00:04:11.220> very<00:04:11.310> positive

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:15.890 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:19.460 

though<00:04:16.890> the<00:04:17.100> next<00:04:17.310> steps<00:04:17.519> now<00:04:17.760> is<00:04:18.060> we<00:04:19.049> go<00:04:19.260> back
