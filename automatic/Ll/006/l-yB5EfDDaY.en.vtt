00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:04.540
 talk about a backup 

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:06.300
 a tomato 

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:09.569
 and we are going to create a unit 

00:00:09.569 --> 00:00:12.769
 on equipment as if it were a local disk 

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:15.670
 well first we are already in start cree 

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:18.850
 that the connected computers are in this case of the loans 

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:20.669
 previously a 

00:00:20.669 --> 00:00:23.699
 a sober cable 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:24.840
 i good 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.149
 team up 

00:00:27.149 --> 00:00:29.019
 as it shows in the environment 

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:32.019
 we click on contact gutiÃ©rrez as here marks it 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.640
 and the rtc folder questions assign in a hospice the unit 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:39.100
 postpone any other by the board 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:42.100
 and in folder 1 this case let's examine 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.190
 it does not seem it in the network we select from the current folders 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:48.400
 we have a duty 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:51.750
 of the Tabasco computer finish 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.360
 and it's not going to open up well in this case it already seems community 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.430
 1 is like a job in trouble 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:00.330
 I opened another side 

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:02.240
 because any doubt 

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:03.989
 well to be him 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.250
 the backup 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:08.180
 we are going to open 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:09.720
 notepad 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.200
 we do not go to 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.770
 and one more 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:17.120
 to the folder where we have many files 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:20.120
 we go what the points that this will send us 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.900
 to the disk of and let's hesitate the command triquis copinh 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:30.160
 true or not but because all the equipment inside the folders and we're going to 

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:32.890
 put p two points 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:34.190
 diego arnal 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:35.810
 the folder that 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:37.100
 let's copy 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.900
 and in this case I took some video games for example and we're going 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:46.290
 asterisk point asterisk that this tells us to copy all the files from 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:47.430
 any expression 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.060
 let's give a space 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.130
 lead to the inverted and s that this 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.660
 indicates 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:57.660
 and I'm going to copy the sub-directors 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:01.970
 and we put 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:03.300
 the pinu unit 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:04.930
 yes he does 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:07.930
 we put the team - network community 

00:02:09.029 --> 00:02:10.619
 and once writers 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.149
 let's support it 

00:02:13.149 --> 00:02:15.819
 as 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:16.710
 3 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:17.909
 palmeiro 

00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:20.649
 a tube ap 

00:02:20.649 --> 00:02:23.029
 empires replace it 

00:02:23.029 --> 00:02:26.499
 let's put that yes artist created here as and as we see 

00:02:27.179 --> 00:02:28.519
 to do the backup 

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:30.599
 it is enough to see unity 

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:34.129
 and we noticed that there was mind starts to copy the videos 

00:02:34.829 --> 00:02:36.159
 of the folder 

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:37.659
 dent and others 

00:02:37.659 --> 00:02:38.669
 concrete 

00:02:38.669 --> 00:02:40.389
 at 1 as marketing 

00:02:40.389 --> 00:02:43.549
 here is copying I have taken a little but 

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:46.549
 I assure you it is faster 

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:50.319
 in graphic mode we lose taste by copying what is expected 

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:54.709
 have we see how you are already copying 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:57.339
 a little shy and water 

00:02:57.339 --> 00:03:00.339
 clinically contaminates from copying is going to close in 

00:03:01.609 --> 00:03:04.609
 when this one before we have to close 

00:03:06.039 --> 00:03:09.609
 and I'm going to access the folder of the other computer to see if 

00:03:09.609 --> 00:03:12.209
 they are effectively nude themselves 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:16.229
 inside well in this casella out we are going to go to network 

00:03:16.779 --> 00:03:18.409
 we are going to open 

00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:19.839
 Folder 

00:03:19.839 --> 00:03:22.279
 the striped chivas 

00:03:22.279 --> 00:03:23.620
 i see 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:26.639
 the pupi 

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:27.919
 in the folder 

00:03:27.919 --> 00:03:29.729
 public 

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:31.949
 and here they are 

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:33.889
 So much these are mine 

00:03:33.889 --> 00:03:36.749
 the end of copy 

00:03:36.749 --> 00:03:39.749
 and I can effectively 

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:45.049
 because they are with everyone 

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:48.049
 the actress Carmen because there is a concept 

00:03:55.999 --> 00:03:57.919
 Well, I hope it has been useful for you
