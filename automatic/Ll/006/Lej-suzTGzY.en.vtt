00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:03.260 

I've<00:00:01.319> heard<00:00:01.620> time<00:00:01.829> and<00:00:01.890> time<00:00:02.220> again<00:00:02.370> that<00:00:03.149> the

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:03.270 
I've heard time and time again that the

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.220 
I've heard time and time again that the
wooden<00:00:03.480> wheels<00:00:03.810> are<00:00:04.110> very<00:00:04.140> noisy<00:00:04.740> I<00:00:05.660> have<00:00:06.660> 13

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:07.230 
wooden wheels are very noisy I have 13

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.620 
wooden wheels are very noisy I have 13
of<00:00:07.259> them<00:00:07.500> and<00:00:07.710> I've<00:00:07.799> never<00:00:08.280> ever<00:00:08.670> experienced

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
of them and I've never ever experienced

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.140 
of them and I've never ever experienced
this<00:00:09.750> problem<00:00:09.929> before<00:00:10.460> however<00:00:11.460> I<00:00:11.700> was<00:00:11.969> just

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
this problem before however I was just

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:19.429 
this problem before however I was just
given<00:00:12.450> one<00:00:12.630> and<00:00:12.960> guess<00:00:13.920> what<00:00:17.840> I've<00:00:18.840> never

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
given one and guess what I've never

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.750 
given one and guess what I've never
heard<00:00:19.710> of<00:00:19.800> we<00:00:20.220> also<00:00:20.340> noisy<00:00:22.580> and<00:00:23.580> one

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
heard of we also noisy and one

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.179 
heard of we also noisy and one
difference<00:00:24.029> that<00:00:24.180> I<00:00:24.240> noticed<00:00:24.630> is<00:00:25.050> that<00:00:25.859> this

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
difference that I noticed is that this

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.800 
difference that I noticed is that this
noisy<00:00:26.550> one<00:00:26.699> has<00:00:27.210> an<00:00:27.420> aluminum<00:00:28.220> stand<00:00:29.810> whereas

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
noisy one has an aluminum stand whereas

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.470 
noisy one has an aluminum stand whereas
all<00:00:31.019> the<00:00:31.230> ones<00:00:31.410> I<00:00:31.529> have<00:00:31.769> are<00:00:31.949> steel<00:00:32.430> and<00:00:32.759> I

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
all the ones I have are steel and I

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.389 
all the ones I have are steel and I
believe<00:00:34.170> they're<00:00:34.350> either<00:00:34.440> powder<00:00:34.800> coated<00:00:35.219> or

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
believe they're either powder coated or

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.610 
believe they're either powder coated or
just<00:00:35.579> painted<00:00:36.000> but<00:00:36.960> nonetheless<00:00:37.140> they're

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
just painted but nonetheless they're

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.160 
just painted but nonetheless they're
steel<00:00:37.920> this<00:00:38.280> is<00:00:38.460> aluminum<00:00:38.730> so<00:00:39.719> I'm<00:00:39.840> guessing

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
steel this is aluminum so I'm guessing

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.459 
steel this is aluminum so I'm guessing
that<00:00:40.230> the<00:00:40.410> aluminum<00:00:41.989> rides<00:00:42.989> more<00:00:43.230> friction

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
that the aluminum rides more friction

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.369 
that the aluminum rides more friction
and<00:00:44.040> probably<00:00:44.550> resonates<00:00:44.969> more<00:00:45.210> so<00:00:46.140> you<00:00:46.200> get

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
and probably resonates more so you get

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:51.529 
and probably resonates more so you get
the<00:00:46.530> noise<00:00:48.710> so<00:00:49.710> one<00:00:49.860> thing<00:00:50.010> I<00:00:50.100> found<00:00:50.309> is<00:00:50.820> that

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
the noise so one thing I found is that

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.369 
the noise so one thing I found is that
if<00:00:51.719> you<00:00:52.100> if<00:00:53.100> you<00:00:53.250> put<00:00:53.430> pressure<00:00:53.730> on<00:00:53.969> it

00:00:54.369 --> 00:00:54.379 
if you if you put pressure on it

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:56.840 
if you if you put pressure on it
what<00:00:55.379> I'm<00:00:55.469> gonna<00:00:55.559> do<00:00:55.770> is<00:00:55.890> push<00:00:56.430> it<00:00:56.520> in<00:00:56.640> and

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
what I'm gonna do is push it in and

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.810 
what I'm gonna do is push it in and
pinch<00:00:57.059> it

00:00:58.810 --> 00:00:58.820 
pinch it

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.540 
pinch it
it<00:00:59.820> can't<00:01:00.059> resonate<00:01:00.449> anymore<00:01:01.309> and<00:01:02.309> it's<00:01:02.430> as

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
it can't resonate anymore and it's as

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.520 
it can't resonate anymore and it's as
quiet<00:01:02.760> as<00:01:03.000> this<00:01:03.120> deal<00:01:03.719> once<00:01:05.600> so<00:01:06.600> a<00:01:06.869> real<00:01:07.260> simple

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
quiet as this deal once so a real simple

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.950 
quiet as this deal once so a real simple
fix<00:01:07.880> you<00:01:08.880> have<00:01:08.970> to<00:01:09.090> forgive<00:01:09.360> this<00:01:09.600> cruddy

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
fix you have to forgive this cruddy

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.810 
fix you have to forgive this cruddy
little<00:01:10.110> copy<00:01:10.890> it's<00:01:11.040> not<00:01:11.159> automatic<00:01:11.670> cotter

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
little copy it's not automatic cotter

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.770 
little copy it's not automatic cotter
pins<00:01:12.060> so<00:01:12.680> this<00:01:13.680> is<00:01:13.799> for<00:01:14.040> example<00:01:14.330> but<00:01:15.330> all<00:01:15.630> you

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
pins so this is for example but all you

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.039 
pins so this is for example but all you
really<00:01:15.810> need<00:01:16.140> to<00:01:16.259> fix<00:01:16.409> this<00:01:16.619> is<00:01:16.890> the<00:01:17.729> original

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:18.049 
really need to fix this is the original

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:20.179 
really need to fix this is the original
washer<00:01:19.049> whatever<00:01:19.530> you<00:01:19.590> got<00:01:19.710> you<00:01:19.920> could<00:01:20.130> be

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
washer whatever you got you could be

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:21.590 
washer whatever you got you could be
replaced<00:01:20.430> with<00:01:20.759> a<00:01:20.820> metal<00:01:21.060> one<00:01:21.180> if<00:01:21.360> you<00:01:21.420> have<00:01:21.509> it

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
replaced with a metal one if you have it

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.969 
replaced with a metal one if you have it
handy<00:01:21.900> a<00:01:22.590> nut<00:01:23.189> in<00:01:23.490> another<00:01:23.790> washer<00:01:24.590> the<00:01:25.590> nut<00:01:25.830> is

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
handy a nut in another washer the nut is

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.920 
handy a nut in another washer the nut is
going<00:01:26.130> to<00:01:26.189> be<00:01:26.280> used<00:01:26.520> to<00:01:26.700> provide<00:01:27.299> an<00:01:27.600> inward

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
going to be used to provide an inward

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.219 
going to be used to provide an inward
force<00:01:28.259> and<00:01:28.560> essentially<00:01:28.979> pinch<00:01:29.250> the<00:01:30.150> wheel<00:01:30.329> so

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
force and essentially pinch the wheel so

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.859 
force and essentially pinch the wheel so
you<00:01:31.259> put<00:01:31.500> the<00:01:31.590> original<00:01:31.740> washer<00:01:32.280> on<00:01:32.600> the<00:01:33.600> nut

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
you put the original washer on the nut

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.359 
you put the original washer on the nut
and<00:01:34.170> then<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:34.860> new<00:01:34.979> washer<00:01:35.479> puts<00:01:36.479> it<00:01:36.600> all<00:01:36.720> down

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:37.369 
and then the new washer puts it all down

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:45.150 
and then the new washer puts it all down
put<00:01:38.369> in<00:01:38.460> your<00:01:38.549> cotter<00:01:38.759> pin

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:45.160 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.730 

there<00:01:46.160> you<00:01:46.220> go

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:47.740 
there you go

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:50.140 
there you go
you<00:01:48.740> now<00:01:48.860> have<00:01:49.040> an<00:01:49.130> aluminum<00:01:49.370> standard<00:01:49.880> wooden

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:50.150 
you now have an aluminum standard wooden

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:54.240 
you now have an aluminum standard wooden
wheel<00:01:50.410> it<00:01:51.410> doesn't<00:01:51.940> doesn't<00:01:52.940> make<00:01:53.120> the<00:01:53.210> noise

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:54.250 
wheel it doesn't doesn't make the noise

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:56.770 
wheel it doesn't doesn't make the noise
it<00:01:55.250> doesn't<00:01:55.460> spin<00:01:55.640> quite<00:01:55.880> as<00:01:56.000> well<00:01:56.180> but

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 
it doesn't spin quite as well but

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:58.120 
it doesn't spin quite as well but
actually<00:01:56.930> friction<00:01:57.470> on<00:01:57.590> a<00:01:57.620> wheel<00:01:57.800> is<00:01:57.950> a<00:01:58.010> good

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.130 
actually friction on a wheel is a good

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.210 
actually friction on a wheel is a good
thing<00:01:58.310> for<00:01:58.430> sure<00:01:58.580> glider<00:01:58.880> exercise<00:02:00.100> so<00:02:01.100> all

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:01.220 
thing for sure glider exercise so all

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:04.570 
thing for sure glider exercise so all
you<00:02:01.340> have<00:02:01.430> to<00:02:01.520> do<00:02:01.670> is<00:02:03.070> squeeze<00:02:04.070> your<00:02:04.370> wheel<00:02:04.550> a

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:04.580 
you have to do is squeeze your wheel a

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:06.250 
you have to do is squeeze your wheel a
little<00:02:04.730> bit<00:02:04.940> by<00:02:05.300> putting<00:02:05.690> some<00:02:05.900> pressure<00:02:06.110> on

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:06.260 
little bit by putting some pressure on

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:11.470 
little bit by putting some pressure on
at<00:02:06.920> the<00:02:07.070> axle<00:02:07.540> and<00:02:08.540> the<00:02:08.899> noise<00:02:09.050> goes<00:02:09.260> away
