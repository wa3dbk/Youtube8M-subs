tricky<00:00:25.619> I<00:00:25.649> know<00:00:25.769> you've<00:00:26.039> found<00:00:26.249> that<00:00:26.630> and<00:00:27.630> in

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
tricky I know you've found that and in

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.079 
tricky I know you've found that and in
fact<00:00:27.899> we're<00:00:28.259> laboring<00:00:28.829> under<00:00:28.949> old<00:00:29.609> stories

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:30.089 
fact we're laboring under old stories

00:00:30.089 --> 00:00:32.840 
fact we're laboring under old stories
about<00:00:30.119> how<00:00:30.449> best<00:00:30.809> to<00:00:30.989> build<00:00:31.289> new<00:00:31.619> habits<00:00:32.070> here

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
about how best to build new habits here

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.189 
about how best to build new habits here
are<00:00:32.969> the<00:00:33.030> two<00:00:33.179> I<00:00:33.210> think<00:00:33.510> are<00:00:33.660> most<00:00:33.870> pernicious

00:00:34.189 --> 00:00:34.199 
are the two I think are most pernicious

00:00:34.199 --> 00:00:36.830 
are the two I think are most pernicious
the<00:00:34.890> first<00:00:35.160> is<00:00:35.370> if<00:00:35.760> you<00:00:35.969> just<00:00:36.000> do<00:00:36.449> something

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
the first is if you just do something

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.259 
the first is if you just do something
for<00:00:36.989> 21<00:00:37.440> days<00:00:37.620> in<00:00:37.859> a<00:00:37.949> row<00:00:38.160> that's<00:00:38.760> it<00:00:39.030> you're

00:00:39.259 --> 00:00:39.269 
for 21 days in a row that's it you're

00:00:39.269 --> 00:00:42.860 
for 21 days in a row that's it you're
set<00:00:39.679> or<00:00:40.679> maybe<00:00:41.250> this<00:00:41.579> one<00:00:41.640> if<00:00:42.210> you<00:00:42.329> just<00:00:42.510> clench

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
set or maybe this one if you just clench

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.810 
set or maybe this one if you just clench
your<00:00:42.960> teeth<00:00:43.109> and<00:00:43.620> maybe<00:00:44.070> your<00:00:44.250> hands<00:00:44.519> and

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
your teeth and maybe your hands and

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.520 
your teeth and maybe your hands and
maybe<00:00:44.940> your<00:00:45.149> buttocks<00:00:45.480> really<00:00:45.870> tightly<00:00:46.350> and

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
maybe your buttocks really tightly and

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.739 
maybe your buttocks really tightly and
you<00:00:46.800> try<00:00:47.070> really<00:00:47.339> really<00:00:47.820> really<00:00:48.030> really<00:00:48.390> hard

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:48.749 
you try really really really really hard

00:00:48.749 --> 00:00:51.200 
you try really really really really hard
this<00:00:49.079> time<00:00:49.350> it<00:00:49.890> will<00:00:50.010> all<00:00:50.219> be<00:00:50.429> okay

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
this time it will all be okay

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.680 
this time it will all be okay
and<00:00:51.390> of<00:00:51.839> course<00:00:52.140> neither<00:00:52.920> of<00:00:53.190> those<00:00:53.370> work<00:00:53.699> so

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
and of course neither of those work so

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:55.970 
and of course neither of those work so
here's<00:00:55.019> what<00:00:55.170> I<00:00:55.199> want<00:00:55.350> to<00:00:55.469> share<00:00:55.679> with<00:00:55.800> you

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
new habits and here's where I'm going to

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:07.340 
new habits and here's where I'm going to
start<00:01:02.420> we're<00:01:03.420> half<00:01:03.719> zombie<00:01:05.689> research<00:01:06.689> shows

start we're half zombie research shows

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.649 
start we're half zombie research shows
that<00:01:07.920> we're<00:01:08.100> operating<00:01:08.280> in<00:01:08.790> habit<00:01:09.240> mode<00:01:09.450> at

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
that we're operating in habit mode at

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.620 
that we're operating in habit mode at
least<00:01:09.930> 45%<00:01:10.890> of<00:01:10.950> the<00:01:11.070> time<00:01:11.310> that<00:01:11.909> means<00:01:12.210> we're

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
on automatic let me explain how that

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.520 
on automatic let me explain how that
happens<00:01:16.430> imagine<00:01:17.430> your<00:01:17.579> brain<00:01:17.729> is<00:01:18.119> an<00:01:18.360> egg<00:01:18.630> the

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
happens imagine your brain is an egg the

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.499 
happens imagine your brain is an egg the
yolk<00:01:19.560> you<00:01:20.130> can<00:01:20.280> see<00:01:20.490> it<00:01:20.579> there<00:01:20.850> is<00:01:21.030> the

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
yolk you can see it there is the

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.080 
yolk you can see it there is the
conscious<00:01:22.049> mind<00:01:22.079> it's<00:01:22.619> brilliant<00:01:23.159> language

conscious mind it's brilliant language

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.510

and creativity and strategy they all

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.090

around it is the egg white that's your

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.690 
around it is the egg white that's your
unconscious<00:01:35.909> mind<00:01:35.939> and<00:01:36.509> it's<00:01:37.049> this<00:01:37.469> that<00:01:38.280> runs

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
unconscious mind and it's this that runs

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.700 
unconscious mind and it's this that runs
most<00:01:39.240> of<00:01:39.420> your<00:01:39.600> behavior<00:01:40.110> most<00:01:40.320> of<00:01:40.469> our

most of your behavior most of our

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.060 
most of your behavior most of our
behavior<00:01:41.630> so<00:01:42.630> you've<00:01:42.810> got<00:01:42.990> to<00:01:43.109> be<00:01:43.200> smart<00:01:43.649> to

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
behavior so you've got to be smart to

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.279 
behavior so you've got to be smart to
outsmart<00:01:44.579> your<00:01:45.000> own<00:01:45.149> brain<00:01:45.479> you<00:01:45.990> have<00:01:46.020> to

outsmart your own brain you have to

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:48.980 
outsmart your own brain you have to
consciously<00:01:46.680> manage<00:01:47.520> your<00:01:48.210> unconscious

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
consciously manage your unconscious

consciously manage your unconscious
patterns<00:01:50.000> here<00:01:51.000> are<00:01:51.119> two<00:01:51.270> of<00:01:51.390> the<00:01:51.450> best

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
patterns here are two of the best

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.200 
patterns here are two of the best
tactics<00:01:52.079> I<00:01:52.200> know<00:01:52.320> to<00:01:52.560> do<00:01:52.829> just<00:01:53.189> that<00:01:53.399> and<00:01:53.729> the

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
tactics I know to do just that and the

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.660 
tactics I know to do just that and the
first<00:01:54.509> one<00:01:54.899> comes<00:01:55.289> from<00:01:55.409> Charles<00:01:56.070> Duhigg<00:01:56.280> he

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
first one comes from Charles Duhigg he

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.179 
first one comes from Charles Duhigg he
wrote<00:01:56.850> the<00:01:56.969> book<00:01:57.000> the<00:01:57.329> power<00:01:57.359> of<00:01:57.689> habit<00:01:57.750> and<00:01:58.439> he

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
wrote the book the power of habit and he

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:02.389 
wrote the book the power of habit and he
says<00:01:59.429> this<00:01:59.929> rather<00:02:00.929> than<00:02:01.109> focusing<00:02:01.829> only<00:02:02.070> on

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
says this rather than focusing only on

this<00:02:44.200> is<00:02:44.350> the<00:02:44.470> takeaway<00:02:44.890> from<00:02:44.950> Duhigg<00:02:45.580> when

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:46.270 
this is the takeaway from Duhigg when

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:47.970 
this is the takeaway from Duhigg when
you<00:02:46.360> become<00:02:46.660> conscious<00:02:47.080> of<00:02:47.350> what<00:02:47.530> triggers
