hey what's up everyone I was just about

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:06.200 
hey what's up everyone I was just about
to<00:00:04.319> do<00:00:04.500> a<00:00:04.529> quick<00:00:04.799> build<00:00:05.100> of<00:00:05.370> the<00:00:05.520> build<00:00:05.730> custom

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:06.210 
to do a quick build of the build custom

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:08.450 
to do a quick build of the build custom
GP<00:00:06.629> base<00:00:06.899> so<00:00:07.140> I<00:00:07.170> decided<00:00:07.529> I<00:00:07.799> might<00:00:08.250> as<00:00:08.370> well

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
GP base so I decided I might as well

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.669 
GP base so I decided I might as well
make<00:00:08.639> a<00:00:08.849> quick<00:00:09.090> little<00:00:09.269> review<00:00:09.360> out<00:00:09.750> of<00:00:09.900> it<00:00:10.019> so

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
make a quick little review out of it so

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:12.820 
make a quick little review out of it so
just<00:00:11.040> a<00:00:11.519> quick<00:00:11.639> look<00:00:11.759> at<00:00:11.910> the<00:00:11.969> box<00:00:12.120> first<00:00:12.360> and

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:12.830 
just a quick look at the box first and

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:14.870 
just a quick look at the box first and
on<00:00:13.830> the<00:00:14.009> front<00:00:14.219> here<00:00:14.309> we've<00:00:14.460> got<00:00:14.580> the<00:00:14.670> build

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
on the front here we've got the build

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.920 
on the front here we've got the build
strike<00:00:15.330> the<00:00:16.170> Zaku<00:00:16.500> amazing<00:00:17.039> gundam<00:00:17.609> x<00:00:17.930> moving

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
strike the Zaku amazing gundam x moving

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.710 
strike the Zaku amazing gundam x moving
on<00:00:19.050> to<00:00:19.170> the<00:00:19.260> side<00:00:19.560> and<00:00:19.949> we've<00:00:20.640> got<00:00:21.000> the

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
on to the side and we've got the

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.779 
on to the side and we've got the
finished<00:00:22.050> build<00:00:22.230> strike<00:00:22.560> there<00:00:22.949> the<00:00:23.550> base

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
finished build strike there the base

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.519 
finished build strike there the base
when<00:00:24.029> it's<00:00:24.150> finished<00:00:24.480> I<00:00:24.779> think<00:00:25.289> this<00:00:25.410> is

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
when it's finished I think this is

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.370 
when it's finished I think this is
showing<00:00:25.740> some<00:00:25.980> of<00:00:26.039> the<00:00:26.099> movement<00:00:26.580> of<00:00:26.640> the<00:00:26.760> base

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:27.380 
showing some of the movement of the base

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:30.050 
showing some of the movement of the base
maybe<00:00:28.380> away<00:00:28.619> you<00:00:28.680> can<00:00:28.890> tuck<00:00:29.220> away<00:00:29.400> this<00:00:29.789> part

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
maybe away you can tuck away this part

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.569 
maybe away you can tuck away this part
here<00:00:30.300> I'm<00:00:30.420> not<00:00:30.510> sure<00:00:30.590> shows<00:00:31.590> that<00:00:31.800> this<00:00:31.949> can

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
here I'm not sure shows that this can

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.920 
here I'm not sure shows that this can
take<00:00:32.790> a<00:00:32.850> Gundam<00:00:33.360> try<00:00:33.660> age<00:00:33.899> card<00:00:34.290> which<00:00:35.809> if<00:00:36.809> you

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
take a Gundam try age card which if you

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.030 
take a Gundam try age card which if you
have<00:00:37.079> the<00:00:37.200> build<00:00:37.350> strike<00:00:37.649> you<00:00:37.800> would<00:00:37.950> have

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
have the build strike you would have

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.299 
have the build strike you would have
gotten<00:00:38.190> one<00:00:38.399> off<00:00:39.320> as<00:00:40.320> well<00:00:40.559> as<00:00:40.680> this<00:00:40.800> included

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
gotten one off as well as this included

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.510 
gotten one off as well as this included
info<00:00:42.030> card<00:00:42.510> thing<00:00:42.870> here<00:00:43.260> onto<00:00:44.219> the<00:00:44.309> other<00:00:44.430> side

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
info card thing here onto the other side

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.670 
info card thing here onto the other side
and<00:00:45.000> it's<00:00:45.090> the<00:00:45.210> finished<00:00:45.450> base<00:00:45.660> again<00:00:46.140> and<00:00:46.440> the

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
and it's the finished base again and the

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.630 
and it's the finished base again and the
GP<00:00:47.010> base<00:00:47.219> here<00:00:47.520> in<00:00:47.610> the<00:00:47.700> anime<00:00:49.280> so<00:00:50.280> let's<00:00:50.460> bust

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
GP base here in the anime so let's bust

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.750 
GP base here in the anime so let's bust
it<00:00:50.760> out<00:00:50.910> and<00:00:51.090> see<00:00:51.210> what<00:00:51.360> we've<00:00:51.449> got<00:00:51.600> inside<00:00:52.760> so

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
it out and see what we've got inside so

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.369 
it out and see what we've got inside so
not<00:00:53.879> a<00:00:53.910> whole<00:00:54.090> lot<00:00:54.239> in<00:00:54.390> here<00:00:54.570> just<00:00:54.960> one<00:00:55.140> bag<00:00:55.350> of

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
not a whole lot in here just one bag of

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.910 
not a whole lot in here just one bag of
runners<00:00:55.949> and<00:00:56.250> the<00:00:56.940> instructions<00:00:57.770> which<00:00:58.770> is

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
runners and the instructions which is

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.389 
runners and the instructions which is
just<00:00:59.129> one<00:00:59.309> fold<00:00:59.520> out<00:00:59.670> sheet<00:01:00.890> so<00:01:01.890> not<00:01:02.070> much<00:01:02.219> to

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
just one fold out sheet so not much to

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.039 
just one fold out sheet so not much to
see<00:01:02.550> here<00:01:02.579> you<00:01:03.090> can<00:01:03.239> see<00:01:03.359> it's<00:01:03.480> quite<00:01:03.600> simple

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049

not a whole lot to see here really
here's<00:01:07.260> the<00:01:07.409> card<00:01:07.650> I<00:01:07.830> guess<00:01:07.950> you<00:01:08.100> cut<00:01:08.250> that<00:01:08.400> out

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
here's the card I guess you cut that out

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.750 
here's the card I guess you cut that out
and<00:01:09.770> stick<00:01:10.770> it<00:01:10.890> into<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.159> finished<00:01:11.400> pace<00:01:11.580> if

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
and stick it into the finished pace if

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.740 
and stick it into the finished pace if
you<00:01:11.820> want<00:01:12.860> like<00:01:13.860> this<00:01:14.070> here<00:01:14.340> so<00:01:15.030> this<00:01:15.210> base<00:01:15.420> can

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
you want like this here so this base can

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.950 
you want like this here so this base can
be<00:01:15.780> used<00:01:16.080> with<00:01:16.259> an<00:01:16.350> LED<00:01:16.590> unit<00:01:17.570> okay<00:01:18.570> and<00:01:18.750> onto

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
be used with an LED unit okay and onto

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:24.830 
be used with an LED unit okay and onto
the<00:01:19.049> bag<00:01:21.680> take<00:01:22.680> them<00:01:22.979> up<00:01:23.159> and<00:01:23.400> so<00:01:24.360> for<00:01:24.540> runners

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
the bag take them up and so for runners

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:31.609 
the bag take them up and so for runners
we've<00:01:25.049> got<00:01:25.229> a<00:01:25.350> 1<00:01:25.770> a<00:01:27.140> 2<00:01:28.140> and<00:01:28.890> B<00:01:30.470> which<00:01:31.470> has<00:01:31.590> a

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
we've got a 1 a 2 and B which has a

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.380 
we've got a 1 a 2 and B which has a
large<00:01:31.890> pure<00:01:32.189> part<00:01:32.460> here<00:01:32.640> of<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:32.850> clear<00:01:33.090> front

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
large pure part here of the clear front

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.289 
large pure part here of the clear front
panel<00:01:33.810> and<00:01:34.189> this<00:01:35.189> part<00:01:35.460> here<00:01:35.759> which<00:01:35.970> covers

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
panel and this part here which covers

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.590 
panel and this part here which covers
the<00:01:36.570> section<00:01:36.900> the<00:01:36.960> LED<00:01:37.320> unit<00:01:37.500> can<00:01:37.770> go<00:01:37.860> into<00:01:38.600> ok

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
the section the LED unit can go into ok

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.510 
the section the LED unit can go into ok
so<00:01:39.659> that's<00:01:39.900> all<00:01:40.049> the<00:01:40.320> parts<00:01:40.770> cut<00:01:41.070> out<00:01:41.220> and<00:01:41.400> that

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
so that's all the parts cut out and that

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.490 
so that's all the parts cut out and that
didn't<00:01:41.880> even<00:01:41.909> take<00:01:42.240> me<00:01:42.390> two<00:01:42.540> minutes<00:01:42.570> I<00:01:42.930> didn't

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
didn't even take me two minutes I didn't

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.249 
didn't even take me two minutes I didn't
clean<00:01:43.680> up<00:01:43.710> any<00:01:44.040> of<00:01:44.310> the<00:01:44.430> parts<00:01:44.820> so<00:01:45.180> as<00:01:45.960> you<00:01:46.140> can

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
clean up any of the parts so as you can

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.880 
clean up any of the parts so as you can
see<00:01:46.560> maybe<00:01:47.549> can<00:01:47.850> maybe<00:01:48.030> can't<00:01:48.740> some<00:01:49.740> of<00:01:49.829> the

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
see maybe can maybe can't some of the

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.679 
see maybe can maybe can't some of the
bits<00:01:50.040> are<00:01:50.159> still<00:01:50.369> rough<00:01:50.670> there<00:01:51.090> I<00:01:51.299> didn't

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
bits are still rough there I didn't

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.149 
bits are still rough there I didn't
bother<00:01:51.810> clean<00:01:52.140> it<00:01:52.290> up<00:01:52.409> and<00:01:52.590> I<00:01:52.649> usually<00:01:52.829> don't

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
bother clean it up and I usually don't

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.569 
bother clean it up and I usually don't
work<00:01:53.310> bases<00:01:54.049> with<00:01:55.049> mobile<00:01:55.350> suits<00:01:55.590> I<00:01:55.740> will<00:01:55.979> but

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
work bases with mobile suits I will but

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:00.620 
work bases with mobile suits I will but
bases<00:01:57.390> I<00:01:57.570> don't<00:01:57.750> race<00:01:57.869> you<00:01:57.990> the<00:01:58.079> point<00:01:59.570> so<00:02:00.570> I'll

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
bases I don't race you the point so I'll

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:01.910 
bases I don't race you the point so I'll
just<00:02:00.780> go<00:02:00.960> through<00:02:00.990> the<00:02:01.259> assembly<00:02:01.680> pretty

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
just go through the assembly pretty

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:08.210 
just go through the assembly pretty
quickly<00:02:02.159> so<00:02:03.049> starting<00:02:04.049> with<00:02:04.170> this<00:02:04.320> part<00:02:07.220> this

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
quickly so starting with this part this

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.790 
quickly so starting with this part this
way<00:02:08.459> like<00:02:08.700> that<00:02:08.849> up<00:02:09.030> there<00:02:09.200> so<00:02:10.200> round<00:02:10.470> here<00:02:10.770> you

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
way like that up there so round here you

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.490 
way like that up there so round here you
can<00:02:10.950> see<00:02:11.069> that<00:02:11.220> kind<00:02:12.150> of<00:02:12.270> slotting<00:02:12.989> section

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
can see that kind of slotting section

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.760 
can see that kind of slotting section
that

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
that

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.490 
that
then<00:02:14.190> LED<00:02:14.640> unit<00:02:14.820> can<00:02:15.060> go<00:02:15.180> into<00:02:15.380> which<00:02:16.380> you'll

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
then LED unit can go into which you'll

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:17.960 
then LED unit can go into which you'll
see<00:02:16.590> a<00:02:16.680> lot<00:02:16.830> of<00:02:16.920> times<00:02:17.070> in<00:02:17.250> the<00:02:17.370> like<00:02:17.640> torso

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
see a lot of times in the like torso

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.180 
see a lot of times in the like torso
towards<00:02:18.840> the<00:02:18.930> neck<00:02:19.080> of<00:02:19.260> some<00:02:19.470> mobile<00:02:19.980> suits

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
towards the neck of some mobile suits

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:26.150 
towards the neck of some mobile suits
okay<00:02:21.110> in<00:02:22.110> this<00:02:22.790> segment<00:02:24.350> the<00:02:25.350> slots<00:02:25.710> on<00:02:25.920> here

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
okay in this segment the slots on here

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:33.590 
okay in this segment the slots on here
like<00:02:26.310> that<00:02:26.550> actually<00:02:27.030> this<00:02:27.120> goes<00:02:27.300> in<00:02:27.450> first<00:02:32.600> so

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
like that actually this goes in first so

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:47.230 
like that actually this goes in first so
as<00:02:33.690> you<00:02:33.780> can<00:02:33.870> see<00:02:33.930> it's<00:02:34.560> pretty<00:02:34.680> simple<00:02:41.000> okay

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:47.240 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:49.700 

at<00:02:48.240> this<00:02:48.390> point<00:02:48.510> here<00:02:48.810> I'll<00:02:48.900> point<00:02:49.260> out<00:02:49.470> that

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:49.710 
at this point here I'll point out that

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:53.420 
at this point here I'll point out that
there<00:02:50.370> are<00:02:50.520> some<00:02:51.150> marks<00:02:51.660> on<00:02:51.990> this<00:02:52.770> large<00:02:53.010> clear

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
there are some marks on this large clear

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.270 
there are some marks on this large clear
panel<00:02:53.880> and<00:02:54.030> that's<00:02:54.150> out<00:02:54.600> of<00:02:54.840> the<00:02:54.900> packaging<00:02:55.410> so

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
panel and that's out of the packaging so

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.050 
panel and that's out of the packaging so
that<00:02:56.990> may<00:02:57.990> or<00:02:58.560> may<00:02:58.590> not<00:02:59.100> be<00:02:59.250> present<00:02:59.610> on<00:02:59.760> all

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
that may or may not be present on all

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:03.440 
that may or may not be present on all
kits<00:03:00.420> I'm<00:03:00.660> guessing<00:03:01.170> it's<00:03:01.860> just<00:03:02.450> general

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
kits I'm guessing it's just general

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:06.290 
kits I'm guessing it's just general
not-so-great<00:03:04.320> quality<00:03:04.770> control<00:03:05.240> okay<00:03:06.240> so

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 
not-so-great quality control okay so

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:09.260 
not-so-great quality control okay so
that's<00:03:06.660> the<00:03:06.900> GP<00:03:07.350> base<00:03:07.620> completed<00:03:08.430> let's<00:03:09.090> just

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:09.270 
that's the GP base completed let's just

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:10.940 
that's the GP base completed let's just
have<00:03:09.420> a<00:03:09.450> general<00:03:09.660> look<00:03:09.990> at<00:03:10.110> it<00:03:10.230> this<00:03:10.380> is<00:03:10.560> it<00:03:10.710> I

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
have a general look at it this is it I

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:14.150 
have a general look at it this is it I
guess<00:03:11.160> in<00:03:11.490> its<00:03:11.610> base<00:03:11.850> mode<00:03:12.620> this<00:03:13.620> part<00:03:13.890> clicks

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
guess in its base mode this part clicks

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.540 
guess in its base mode this part clicks
up<00:03:14.370> in<00:03:14.550> there<00:03:14.790> and<00:03:15.920> these<00:03:16.920> two<00:03:16.980> little<00:03:17.340> slot

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:17.550 
up in there and these two little slot

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:19.250 
up in there and these two little slot
parts<00:03:17.910> in<00:03:18.060> here<00:03:18.240> connect<00:03:18.570> on<00:03:18.690> in<00:03:18.840> here<00:03:19.020> to<00:03:19.110> hold

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
parts in here connect on in here to hold

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.560 
parts in here connect on in here to hold
it<00:03:19.380> in<00:03:19.500> place<00:03:19.640> you<00:03:20.640> can<00:03:20.790> stick<00:03:21.030> your<00:03:21.060> Gundam<00:03:21.450> on

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:21.570 
it in place you can stick your Gundam on

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:23.650 
it in place you can stick your Gundam on
up<00:03:21.720> here<00:03:21.959> or<00:03:22.200> your<00:03:22.380> Zaku<00:03:22.830> or<00:03:23.040> whatever

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:23.660 
up here or your Zaku or whatever

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:27.290 
up here or your Zaku or whatever
now<00:03:24.660> flips<00:03:24.959> around<00:03:25.700> to<00:03:26.700> be<00:03:26.790> pulled<00:03:27.030> up<00:03:27.150> and

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:27.300 
now flips around to be pulled up and

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:30.790 
now flips around to be pulled up and
down<00:03:27.450> like<00:03:27.630> this<00:03:27.690> so<00:03:28.730> to<00:03:29.730> move<00:03:29.910> like<00:03:30.090> that<00:03:30.120> a

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:30.800 
down like this so to move like that a

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:35.000 
down like this so to move like that a
little<00:03:31.800> bit<00:03:31.890> of<00:03:31.950> movement<00:03:32.310> here<00:03:32.730> as<00:03:33.890> well<00:03:34.890> as

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
little bit of movement here as well as

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:37.790 
little bit of movement here as well as
up<00:03:35.160> here<00:03:35.190> as<00:03:35.430> well<00:03:36.260> so<00:03:37.260> unless<00:03:37.440> that<00:03:37.500> this

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:37.800 
up here as well so unless that this

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:40.010 
up here as well so unless that this
opens<00:03:38.100> up<00:03:38.280> to<00:03:38.610> put<00:03:38.850> whatever<00:03:39.600> you<00:03:39.750> want<00:03:39.900> to<00:03:39.990> put

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:40.020 
opens up to put whatever you want to put

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.780 
opens up to put whatever you want to put
in<00:03:40.200> there

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:40.790 
in there

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:43.460 
in there
and<00:03:41.790> stick<00:03:42.209> this<00:03:42.330> little<00:03:42.660> segment<00:03:42.870> in<00:03:43.200> here<00:03:43.380> if

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
and stick this little segment in here if

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:46.490 
and stick this little segment in here if
you'd<00:03:43.620> like<00:03:43.800> or<00:03:44.900> you<00:03:45.900> can<00:03:45.930> throw<00:03:46.260> something

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
you'd like or you can throw something

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:49.730 
you'd like or you can throw something
like<00:03:46.650> try<00:03:47.160> age<00:03:47.340> card<00:03:47.640> in<00:03:47.850> there<00:03:48.060> and<00:03:48.590> yeah<00:03:49.590> that

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:49.740 
like try age card in there and yeah that

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:51.260 
like try age card in there and yeah that
doesn't<00:03:49.980> hold<00:03:50.070> on<00:03:50.280> so<00:03:50.459> securely<00:03:50.850> as<00:03:51.060> you<00:03:51.150> can

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:51.270 
doesn't hold on so securely as you can

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:56.090 
doesn't hold on so securely as you can
see<00:03:53.390> around<00:03:54.390> here<00:03:54.750> on<00:03:54.810> the<00:03:54.900> back<00:03:55.080> section<00:03:55.800> for

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:56.100 
see around here on the back section for

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:59.000 
see around here on the back section for
the<00:03:56.160> LED<00:03:56.430> like<00:03:56.610> I<00:03:56.640> showed<00:03:56.850> before<00:03:57.800> this<00:03:58.800> can

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 
the LED like I showed before this can

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:04.210 
the LED like I showed before this can
also<00:03:59.220> Bend<00:03:59.640> back<00:03:59.850> and<00:04:00.120> tuck<00:04:00.780> in<00:04:01.820> here<00:04:02.820> as<00:04:03.060> well

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:04.220 
also Bend back and tuck in here as well

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:06.050 
also Bend back and tuck in here as well
store<00:04:05.220> it<00:04:05.400> out<00:04:05.490> of<00:04:05.610> the<00:04:05.700> way

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
store it out of the way

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.480 
store it out of the way
okay<00:04:06.810> so<00:04:06.870> flip<00:04:07.200> it<00:04:07.290> back<00:04:07.470> to<00:04:07.650> the<00:04:08.220> base

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:08.490 
okay so flip it back to the base

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:11.030 
okay so flip it back to the base
position<00:04:09.050> and<00:04:10.050> we'll<00:04:10.320> stick<00:04:10.530> to<00:04:10.590> build<00:04:10.770> strike

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040 
position and we'll stick to build strike

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:13.040 
position and we'll stick to build strike
here<00:04:11.250> on<00:04:11.400> it<00:04:11.550> and<00:04:11.700> there<00:04:12.390> we<00:04:12.540> have<00:04:12.720> the<00:04:12.870> build

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:13.050 
here on it and there we have the build

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:17.180 
here on it and there we have the build
strike<00:04:13.470> on<00:04:13.680> the<00:04:13.830> build<00:04:14.040> custom<00:04:14.489> GP<00:04:14.970> base<00:04:16.190> one

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.190 
strike on the build custom GP base one

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:18.979 
strike on the build custom GP base one
good<00:04:17.370> point<00:04:17.549> about<00:04:17.760> it<00:04:17.820> is<00:04:18.000> it<00:04:18.270> does<00:04:18.630> give<00:04:18.900> you

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:18.989 
good point about it is it does give you

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:20.630 
good point about it is it does give you
somewhere<00:04:19.260> to<00:04:19.410> display<00:04:19.739> the<00:04:19.950> Gundam<00:04:20.250> try<00:04:20.459> age

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:20.640 
somewhere to display the Gundam try age

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:22.640 
somewhere to display the Gundam try age
card<00:04:20.970> that<00:04:21.150> you<00:04:21.209> get<00:04:21.390> with<00:04:21.570> the<00:04:21.720> kids<00:04:21.960> but<00:04:22.560> this

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.650 
card that you get with the kids but this

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:23.900 
card that you get with the kids but this
is<00:04:22.800> a<00:04:22.830> really<00:04:23.040> nice<00:04:23.220> option<00:04:23.430> to<00:04:23.640> be<00:04:23.729> able<00:04:23.820> to

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:23.910 
is a really nice option to be able to

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:25.460 
is a really nice option to be able to
display<00:04:24.120> the<00:04:24.360> card<00:04:24.600> and<00:04:24.810> the<00:04:25.169> kit<00:04:25.320> together

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:25.470 
display the card and the kit together

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:26.910 
display the card and the kit together
it's<00:04:25.950> pretty<00:04:26.070> cool

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:26.920 
it's pretty cool

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:29.220 
it's pretty cool
but<00:04:27.610> there's<00:04:27.790> also<00:04:27.970> the<00:04:28.270> option<00:04:28.690> as<00:04:28.780> well<00:04:28.900> to

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:29.230 
but there's also the option as well to

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:31.320 
but there's also the option as well to
use<00:04:29.500> this<00:04:29.650> with<00:04:29.830> other<00:04:30.040> kits<00:04:30.370> like<00:04:30.700> any<00:04:31.120> other

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:31.330 
use this with other kits like any other

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:33.300 
use this with other kits like any other
high<00:04:31.540> grade<00:04:31.810> kit<00:04:32.110> and<00:04:32.350> if<00:04:32.890> you<00:04:32.950> do<00:04:33.040> happen<00:04:33.190> to

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:33.310 
high grade kit and if you do happen to

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:34.800 
high grade kit and if you do happen to
have<00:04:33.370> more<00:04:33.610> try<00:04:33.850> age<00:04:34.030> cards<00:04:34.450> like<00:04:34.630> if<00:04:34.750> you

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:34.810 
have more try age cards like if you

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:36.120 
have more try age cards like if you
bought<00:04:34.990> the<00:04:35.110> Banshee<00:04:35.440> noir<00:04:35.650> and<00:04:35.860> or<00:04:35.950> something

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:36.130 
bought the Banshee noir and or something

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:38.070 
bought the Banshee noir and or something
like<00:04:36.340> that<00:04:36.400> that<00:04:36.670> includes<00:04:37.060> one<00:04:37.270> if<00:04:37.960> you

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:38.080 
like that that includes one if you

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:39.840 
like that that includes one if you
really<00:04:38.320> want<00:04:38.470> to<00:04:38.740> if<00:04:39.280> you<00:04:39.370> happen<00:04:39.670> to<00:04:39.700> have

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:39.850 
really want to if you happen to have

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:41.940 
really want to if you happen to have
other<00:04:40.090> try<00:04:40.360> age<00:04:40.510> cards<00:04:41.020> you<00:04:41.140> can<00:04:41.290> display<00:04:41.770> them

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:41.950 
other try age cards you can display them

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:44.910 
other try age cards you can display them
like<00:04:42.100> this<00:04:42.250> as<00:04:42.430> well<00:04:43.470> here's<00:04:44.470> a<00:04:44.530> very<00:04:44.710> quick

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:44.920 
like this as well here's a very quick

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:47.580 
like this as well here's a very quick
example<00:04:45.040> of<00:04:45.460> it<00:04:45.580> with<00:04:45.730> a<00:04:45.910> Gundam<00:04:46.390> LED<00:04:46.750> unit<00:04:46.930> so

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:47.590 
example of it with a Gundam LED unit so

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:49.440 
example of it with a Gundam LED unit so
just<00:04:47.800> for<00:04:47.890> demonstration<00:04:47.950> purposes<00:04:48.580> I<00:04:49.120> threw

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:49.450 
just for demonstration purposes I threw

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:52.500 
just for demonstration purposes I threw
the<00:04:49.870> ignition<00:04:50.590> mode<00:04:50.770> Axius<00:04:51.340> LED<00:04:51.880> unit<00:04:52.180> into<00:04:52.390> it

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:52.510 
the ignition mode Axius LED unit into it

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:56.430 
the ignition mode Axius LED unit into it
for<00:04:52.630> a<00:04:52.720> look<00:04:53.490> as<00:04:54.490> you<00:04:54.940> can<00:04:55.090> see<00:04:55.180> it's<00:04:55.330> a<00:04:55.570> bit

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:56.440 
for a look as you can see it's a bit

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:59.040 
for a look as you can see it's a bit
underwhelming<00:04:57.160> so<00:04:57.520> I<00:04:57.820> wouldn't<00:04:58.750> really<00:04:58.840> see

00:04:59.040 --> 00:04:59.050 
underwhelming so I wouldn't really see

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:00.330 
underwhelming so I wouldn't really see
the<00:04:59.140> point<00:04:59.380> in<00:04:59.470> rushing<00:04:59.710> out<00:04:59.800> to<00:04:59.830> get<00:05:00.130> an<00:05:00.220> LED

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:00.340 
the point in rushing out to get an LED

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:03.540 
the point in rushing out to get an LED
unit<00:05:00.850> specifically<00:05:01.690> for<00:05:01.990> this<00:05:02.170> base<00:05:02.550> so

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:03.550 
unit specifically for this base so

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:05.280 
unit specifically for this base so
unless<00:05:03.760> you<00:05:03.880> really<00:05:04.030> need<00:05:04.210> that<00:05:04.360> LED<00:05:04.720> unit<00:05:05.050> I

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:05.290 
unless you really need that LED unit I

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:08.010 
unless you really need that LED unit I
would<00:05:05.680> opt<00:05:06.010> not<00:05:06.340> to<00:05:07.000> get<00:05:07.300> it<00:05:07.420> personally

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:08.020 
would opt not to get it personally

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:10.080 
would opt not to get it personally
or<00:05:08.170> if<00:05:09.130> you<00:05:09.190> just<00:05:09.340> have<00:05:09.490> one<00:05:09.520> knocking<00:05:09.850> around

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:10.090 
or if you just have one knocking around

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:13.200 
or if you just have one knocking around
just<00:05:10.780> go<00:05:10.900> for<00:05:11.050> that<00:05:11.490> so<00:05:12.490> that's<00:05:12.700> a<00:05:12.790> quick<00:05:12.940> look

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:13.210 
just go for that so that's a quick look

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:15.630 
just go for that so that's a quick look
at<00:05:13.330> the<00:05:13.420> build<00:05:13.630> custom<00:05:14.110> GP<00:05:14.440> base<00:05:14.620> so<00:05:15.460> it<00:05:15.520> does

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:15.640 
at the build custom GP base so it does

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:16.830 
at the build custom GP base so it does
make<00:05:15.790> a<00:05:15.820> nice<00:05:15.970> display<00:05:16.210> option<00:05:16.600> for<00:05:16.780> the

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:16.840 
make a nice display option for the

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:19.470 
make a nice display option for the
high-grade<00:05:17.170> build<00:05:17.440> Gundam<00:05:18.000> and<00:05:19.000> can<00:05:19.180> also<00:05:19.300> be

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:19.480 
high-grade build Gundam and can also be

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:21.300 
high-grade build Gundam and can also be
used<00:05:19.630> to<00:05:19.690> display<00:05:19.930> the<00:05:20.560> Tri<00:05:20.740> edge<00:05:20.890> card<00:05:21.160> that

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:21.310 
used to display the Tri edge card that

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:24.120 
used to display the Tri edge card that
you<00:05:21.370> get<00:05:21.520> with<00:05:21.610> it<00:05:21.640> as<00:05:21.820> well<00:05:21.970> so<00:05:22.950> yeah<00:05:23.950> so
