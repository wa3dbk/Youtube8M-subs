 photos on the Internet and on pages 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:20.280
 gloss in the end by reviewing dozens

 there is this distance is supposed to 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.860
 be this growth 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.780
 the operation lasts an hour and a half despite 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.450
 the fact that all the unpleasant moments you 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:00.390

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.500
 scary moments the first two are 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.690

 break your spout ie pull the bones together 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:17.630
 nose in order for it to become already sound 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:20.270

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:24.680
 the doctors themselves they are interested in success 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:27.950
 even more than patients 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:29.630
 it's all the same ambitions of the surgeon understand 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.640
 it's even more patient than desire 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:34.820

 nose is estimated 12 months after 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.810
 operations 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:50.780
