 folder of your choice 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:03.820
 under the name of your choice I leave me 

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:06.580
 here the word by default and I click on 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:08.350
 save for an animated collage it's 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:11.440
 just as simple so you just need to 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:13.840
 select your animated collage and 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:16.630
 click on the download button for 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:19.000
 an animated collage you need or even 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:22.960
 a premium dvd offer to retrieve it 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:25.210
 in video format so shaped animated 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:26.649
 otherwise if you do not have this offer 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:29.830
 you can still save it in 

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:32.310
 as jpeg but it will be a collage 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:34.330
 static on your computer 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.580
 so here I'm going to show you how 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:39.940
 download on video 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:41.470
 so you fall directly on the page 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:43.750
 from that they to the player to make a 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:46.179
 video recovery and you no longer have 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:46.899
 than to confirm it is done as for a 

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:49.390
 slideshow 

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:51.390
 with the difference that if there is any 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:53.619
 music on your collage for the moment 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.030
 this music will not be in question and 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:56.580
 so your collage will not have any music 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:59.050
 at registration 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:01.989
 you have to go through the stage of 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:03.940
 slideshows for that if you want 

00:02:01.989 --> 00:02:06.069
 save it in jpeg 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:08.200
 just click on jpeg and that 

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:10.750
 is going exactly like for a 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:12.640
 static collage here I hope this 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:16.080
 tutorial will help you and I tell you 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.080
