compared<00:04:55.039> to<00:04:55.070> the<00:04:55.220> other<00:04:55.539> sim<00:04:56.539> chrome<00:04:56.720> wheels

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:56.930 
compared to the other sim chrome wheels

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:59.830 
compared to the other sim chrome wheels
but<00:04:57.919> I<00:04:58.370> was<00:04:58.639> reading<00:04:58.820> up<00:04:58.970> on<00:04:59.090> this<00:04:59.300> and<00:04:59.509> they

00:04:59.830 --> 00:04:59.840 
but I was reading up on this and they

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:03.839 
but I was reading up on this and they
say<00:05:00.110> that<00:05:01.660> there's<00:05:02.660> a<00:05:02.750> lot<00:05:02.960> of<00:05:03.050> holes<00:05:03.259> because

00:05:03.839 --> 00:05:03.849 
say that there's a lot of holes because

00:05:03.849 --> 00:05:06.969 
say that there's a lot of holes because
it'll<00:05:04.849> it'll<00:05:05.120> allow<00:05:05.449> air<00:05:05.870> flow<00:05:05.900> to<00:05:06.680> go<00:05:06.800> through

00:05:06.969 --> 00:05:06.979 
it'll it'll allow air flow to go through

00:05:06.979 --> 00:05:10.899 
it'll it'll allow air flow to go through
the<00:05:07.159> beyblade<00:05:07.340> for<00:05:07.729> stamina<00:05:08.500> purposes<00:05:09.909> which

00:05:10.899 --> 00:05:10.909 
the beyblade for stamina purposes which

00:05:10.909 --> 00:05:15.089 
the beyblade for stamina purposes which
I<00:05:11.030> thought<00:05:11.150> that<00:05:11.270> was<00:05:11.389> pretty<00:05:11.509> interesting

00:05:15.089 --> 00:05:15.099 

00:05:15.099 --> 00:05:19.710 

alright<00:05:16.099> and<00:05:16.310> here<00:05:16.610> we<00:05:16.880> have<00:05:17.860> what<00:05:18.860> is<00:05:18.979> this<00:05:19.130> si

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:19.720 
alright and here we have what is this si

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:24.969 
alright and here we have what is this si
165<00:05:20.720> which<00:05:21.380> stands<00:05:21.800> for<00:05:22.180> switch<00:05:23.180> tack<00:05:23.979> which

00:05:24.969 --> 00:05:24.979 
165 which stands for switch tack which

00:05:24.979 --> 00:05:30.430 
165 which stands for switch tack which
is<00:05:25.190> kind<00:05:25.460> of<00:05:25.520> like<00:05:26.080> SW<00:05:28.210> was<00:05:29.210> it<00:05:29.360> 145<00:05:29.870> yeah<00:05:30.020> 70

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:30.440 
is kind of like SW was it 145 yeah 70

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:34.600 
is kind of like SW was it 145 yeah 70
145<00:05:30.949> so<00:05:31.699> this<00:05:32.570> is<00:05:32.960> pretty<00:05:33.740> massive<00:05:33.949> just

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:34.610 
145 so this is pretty massive just

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:38.469 
145 so this is pretty massive just
imagine<00:05:35.270> a<00:05:35.449> bigger<00:05:36.229> version<00:05:36.620> of<00:05:36.979> 80<00:05:37.340> 145<00:05:38.090> but

00:05:38.469 --> 00:05:38.479 
imagine a bigger version of 80 145 but

00:05:38.479 --> 00:05:42.969 
imagine a bigger version of 80 145 but
anyway<00:05:38.889> si<00:05:39.889> 145<00:05:40.990> you<00:05:41.990> could<00:05:42.139> switch<00:05:42.440> the<00:05:42.770> modes

00:05:42.969 --> 00:05:42.979 
anyway si 145 you could switch the modes

00:05:42.979 --> 00:05:46.629 
anyway si 145 you could switch the modes
on<00:05:43.430> this<00:05:43.699> track<00:05:44.020> so<00:05:45.020> right<00:05:45.229> now<00:05:45.380> if<00:05:45.800> the<00:05:46.400> disc

00:05:46.629 --> 00:05:46.639 
on this track so right now if the disc

00:05:46.639 --> 00:05:49.209 
on this track so right now if the disc
is<00:05:46.789> facing<00:05:47.150> upwards<00:05:47.570> its<00:05:48.080> attack<00:05:48.740> mode<00:05:48.979> and

00:05:49.209 --> 00:05:49.219 
is facing upwards its attack mode and

00:05:49.219 --> 00:05:52.749 
is facing upwards its attack mode and
you<00:05:49.400> can<00:05:49.460> switch<00:05:49.789> this<00:05:49.940> out<00:05:51.310> facing<00:05:52.310> downwards

00:05:52.749 --> 00:05:52.759 
you can switch this out facing downwards

00:05:52.759 --> 00:05:57.270 
you can switch this out facing downwards
is<00:05:53.320> defense<00:05:54.320> mode<00:05:55.750> it's<00:05:56.750> like<00:05:56.870> a<00:05:56.900> tank

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:57.280 
is defense mode it's like a tank

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:04.839 
is defense mode it's like a tank
