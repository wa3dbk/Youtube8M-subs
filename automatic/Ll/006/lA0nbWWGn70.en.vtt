peace in the month of August one thing
that<00:02:03.749> I<00:02:03.779> was<00:02:04.439> trying<00:02:04.740> to<00:02:04.829> figure<00:02:05.219> out<00:02:05.279> when

00:02:06.019 --> 00:02:06.029 
that I was trying to figure out when

00:02:06.029 --> 00:02:08.509 
that I was trying to figure out when
doing<00:02:06.569> this<00:02:06.689> whole<00:02:06.959> read<00:02:07.590> along<00:02:07.859> thing<00:02:08.220> for

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:08.519 
doing this whole read along thing for

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:10.429 
doing this whole read along thing for
other<00:02:08.700> people<00:02:09.149> was<00:02:09.450> I<00:02:09.659> wanted<00:02:10.110> to<00:02:10.229> make<00:02:10.409> sure

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:10.439 
other people was I wanted to make sure

00:02:10.439 --> 00:02:10.850 
other people was I wanted to make sure
that

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
that

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.470 
that
if<00:02:10.920> you<00:02:11.040> don't<00:02:11.310> have<00:02:11.550> this<00:02:11.820> version<00:02:12.060> you<00:02:12.300> could

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
if you don't have this version you could

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.150 
if you don't have this version you could
still<00:02:12.660> read<00:02:12.840> along<00:02:13.080> with<00:02:13.140> us<00:02:13.470> but<00:02:13.980> the<00:02:14.070> problem

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
still read along with us but the problem

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:15.590 
still read along with us but the problem
that<00:02:14.400> I'm<00:02:14.610> finding<00:02:15.000> is<00:02:15.120> that<00:02:15.300> different

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
that I'm finding is that different

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.080 
that I'm finding is that different
translations<00:02:16.260> mark<00:02:17.100> up<00:02:17.340> their<00:02:17.640> books<00:02:17.850> or

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
translations mark up their books or

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.020 
translations mark up their books or
separate<00:02:18.810> their<00:02:18.990> books<00:02:19.290> differently<00:02:20.010> so<00:02:20.520> I

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
separate their books differently so I

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.730 
separate their books differently so I
was<00:02:21.240> looking<00:02:21.510> at<00:02:21.690> the<00:02:21.900> version<00:02:22.290> that's<00:02:22.530> on

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 
was looking at the version that's on

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:24.710 
was looking at the version that's on
Project<00:02:23.190> Gutenberg<00:02:23.280> and<00:02:23.820> there's<00:02:24.060> like<00:02:24.240> 15

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
Project Gutenberg and there's like 15

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.590 
Project Gutenberg and there's like 15
books<00:02:25.500> and<00:02:25.830> within<00:02:26.310> each<00:02:26.580> book<00:02:26.910> there<00:02:27.270> is

books and within each book there is

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.480 
books and within each book there is
different<00:02:28.230> chapters<00:02:28.620> and<00:02:28.890> the<00:02:29.100> way<00:02:29.220> this

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:29.490 
different chapters and the way this

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:31.610 
different chapters and the way this
version<00:02:30.030> of<00:02:30.330> the<00:02:30.450> book<00:02:30.630> is<00:02:30.840> broken<00:02:31.170> up<00:02:31.320> or<00:02:31.470> this

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
version of the book is broken up or this

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:32.930 
version of the book is broken up or this
translation<00:02:32.070> of<00:02:32.130> the<00:02:32.250> book<00:02:32.370> is<00:02:32.520> broken<00:02:32.670> up

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
translation of the book is broken up

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.720 
translation of the book is broken up
it's<00:02:33.180> there's<00:02:33.750> four<00:02:34.140> books<00:02:34.530> and<00:02:34.920> each<00:02:35.430> book

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
it's there's four books and each book

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.520 
it's there's four books and each book
has<00:02:36.030> different<00:02:36.420> parts<00:02:36.630> and<00:02:36.930> each<00:02:37.050> part<00:02:37.470> has

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
has different parts and each part has

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.920 
has different parts and each part has
different<00:02:37.980> chapters<00:02:38.370> so<00:02:39.060> the<00:02:39.660> trans

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
different chapters so the trans

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:41.840 
different chapters so the trans
different<00:02:40.350> translations<00:02:40.800> don't<00:02:41.070> necessarily

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
different translations don't necessarily

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:44.810 
different translations don't necessarily
keep<00:02:42.390> any<00:02:42.810> sort<00:02:43.230> of<00:02:43.410> standard<00:02:44.040> in<00:02:44.370> terms<00:02:44.610> of

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
how to break up the book which is going

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.780 
how to break up the book which is going
to<00:02:46.290> make<00:02:46.470> this<00:02:46.710> read<00:02:46.860> along<00:02:47.100> a<00:02:47.130> little<00:02:47.700> bit

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
to make this read along a little bit

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:49.400 
to make this read along a little bit
more<00:02:47.970> difficult<00:02:48.420> if<00:02:48.540> you<00:02:48.630> don't<00:02:48.900> have<00:02:49.140> this

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
more difficult if you don't have this

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:51.290 
more difficult if you don't have this
translation<00:02:50.010> but<00:02:50.430> what<00:02:50.550> Jenny<00:02:50.760> and<00:02:50.910> I<00:02:50.970> plan<00:02:51.270> on

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:51.300 
translation but what Jenny and I plan on

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:53.870 
translation but what Jenny and I plan on
doing<00:02:51.450> is<00:02:51.750> because<00:02:52.050> there<00:02:52.740> are<00:02:52.770> four<00:02:53.370> books<00:02:53.670> in

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880
