 hello friends how are we good 

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:18.270
 occasions I bring this topic that many do not 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:20.100
 they had asked and is very father is a subject 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.830
 minimalist for your lock screen for 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:25.470
 change the time to change the format 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.990
 how do you see your device and good to me 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.300
 I liked it enough I had not made them 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.460
 video of this because I had not believed it 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.860
 necessary but many asked me this way 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:38.040
 how good this topic we will be able to 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:41.370
 find in the network of víctor apple sale 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.530
 remember in the repo of víctor apple what 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.950
 you can find completely free and 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.750
 it's called group and what I remember you 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.220
 what is activated is once installed with 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.680
 winterboard because you will not find 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:56.010
 nothing we have to activate directly 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:58.500
 in the settings tab in settings 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:02.040
 let's find a new tab that 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.780
 it's called grübel ok we go in and the only thing 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:05.790
 what we have to do is go to team 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.460
 they come out here we're going to be able to find 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.560
 the color black or white color 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.539
 depending on the wallpaper you have in 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.149
 my case I have this that is a color 

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:17.490
 white but if you want to put it in color 

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:19.240
 black we just block it I think it's going 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.229
 to be a respite 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:26.829
 and it does not come out it just changes the color 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:29.439
 you can change it is also color there is no 

00:01:26.829 --> 00:01:32.350
 here nothing else shows you that both of 

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:33.939
 opacity you want if you do not want anything from 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:35.890
 opacity for example this is 

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:37.570
 completely opaque let's give it k 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:40.119
 notice that I think blank in my 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:43.409
 device would be better appreciated already 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:47.350
 they see looks strong the color looks 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:50.830
 solid let's put it right here in the 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:54.250
 less solid we lock it again 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:56.470
 and they see is a little bit transparent 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:58.180
 it comes out here because it's a matter of taste 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:01.330
 question of approaches as you like more 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:04.210
 as you like less and I say to me 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:06.190

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:07.600

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:08.979

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:20.800
