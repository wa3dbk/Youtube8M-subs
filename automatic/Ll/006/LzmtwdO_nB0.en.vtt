the round here on a different map um I
believe<00:03:33.019> I<00:03:33.829> forgot<00:03:34.549> the<00:03:34.730> name<00:03:35.000> of<00:03:35.209> this<00:03:35.329> map

00:03:35.559 --> 00:03:35.569 
believe I forgot the name of this map

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:47.740 
believe I forgot the name of this map
exactly<00:03:36.260> but<00:03:38.859> it's<00:03:39.859> fun<00:03:40.579> map<00:03:41.290> so<00:03:42.290> far

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:47.750 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:49.910

I believe that's their spawn but I am

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:59.330 
I believe that's their spawn but I am
having<00:03:57.570> a<00:03:57.840> horrible<00:03:58.320> time<00:03:58.590> with<00:03:58.920> accuracy

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 
having a horrible time with accuracy

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:02.120 
having a horrible time with accuracy
dudes<00:03:59.790> at<00:03:59.940> the<00:04:00.090> new<00:04:00.330> they<00:04:01.290> put<00:04:01.530> wind<00:04:01.800> in<00:04:02.010> the

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:02.130 
dudes at the new they put wind in the

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:05.740 
dudes at the new they put wind in the
game<00:04:02.310> finally<00:04:02.880> they<00:04:03.420> put<00:04:03.920> left-right<00:04:04.920> wind

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:05.750 
game finally they put left-right wind

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:11.120 
game finally they put left-right wind
instead<00:04:06.750> of<00:04:06.870> just<00:04:07.080> the<00:04:07.290> bullet<00:04:07.770> drop<00:04:10.130> there's

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:11.130 
instead of just the bullet drop there's

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:14.000 
instead of just the bullet drop there's
some<00:04:11.400> ammo<00:04:11.730> crates<00:04:12.030> around<00:04:12.300> the<00:04:12.420> map<00:04:12.600> and<00:04:13.010> you

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.010 
some ammo crates around the map and you

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:15.910 
some ammo crates around the map and you
can<00:04:14.040> go<00:04:14.280> to<00:04:14.520> them<00:04:14.670> pick<00:04:14.880> up<00:04:15.000> some<00:04:15.210> ammo

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:15.920 
can go to them pick up some ammo

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:19.520 
can go to them pick up some ammo
replenish<00:04:16.920> and<00:04:17.489> with<00:04:18.209> the<00:04:18.390> wind<00:04:18.630> now<00:04:18.930> it<00:04:19.290> makes

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:19.530 
replenish and with the wind now it makes

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:22.130 
replenish and with the wind now it makes
so<00:04:20.070> much<00:04:20.340> harder<00:04:20.760> for<00:04:20.790> this<00:04:21.209> game<00:04:21.450> because<00:04:21.870> now

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:22.140 
so much harder for this game because now

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:24.890 
so much harder for this game because now
you<00:04:22.590> have<00:04:22.800> to<00:04:23.430> stabilize<00:04:23.700> your<00:04:24.240> breath<00:04:24.480> and

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:24.900 
you have to stabilize your breath and

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:28.070 
you have to stabilize your breath and
use<00:04:25.470> the<00:04:25.680> red<00:04:25.890> reticle<00:04:26.510> which<00:04:27.510> is<00:04:27.720> kind<00:04:27.930> of

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:28.080 
use the red reticle which is kind of

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.890 
use the red reticle which is kind of
annoying<00:04:28.350> but<00:04:28.890> puts<00:04:29.670> some<00:04:29.970> fun<00:04:30.240> into<00:04:30.450> the<00:04:30.630> game

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:30.900 
annoying but puts some fun into the game

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:41.050 
annoying but puts some fun into the game
makes<00:04:31.380> it<00:04:31.620> less<00:04:31.830> easy<00:04:32.840> get<00:04:33.840> on<00:04:33.930> my<00:04:34.080> way<00:04:38.300> Adam

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:41.060 
makes it less easy get on my way Adam

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:43.940 
makes it less easy get on my way Adam
yeah<00:04:42.060> see<00:04:42.510> if<00:04:42.750> you<00:04:42.990> noticed<00:04:43.350> you<00:04:43.530> can<00:04:43.650> see<00:04:43.800> the

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:43.950 
yeah see if you noticed you can see the

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:48.350 
yeah see if you noticed you can see the
reticle<00:04:44.250> now<00:04:44.670> and<00:04:46.400> it's<00:04:47.400> kind<00:04:47.880> of<00:04:47.970> messed<00:04:48.180> up

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:48.360 
reticle now and it's kind of messed up

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:50.330 
reticle now and it's kind of messed up
right<00:04:48.540> now<00:04:48.600> you'll<00:04:49.440> be<00:04:49.590> aiming<00:04:49.770> at<00:04:50.070> something

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:50.340 
right now you'll be aiming at something

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:52.340 
right now you'll be aiming at something
with<00:04:50.700> the<00:04:50.820> reticle<00:04:51.120> on<00:04:51.450> when<00:04:51.720> you<00:04:51.810> stabilize

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:52.350 
with the reticle on when you stabilize

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:54.080 
with the reticle on when you stabilize
your<00:04:52.500> breath<00:04:52.740> and<00:04:53.010> it'll<00:04:53.280> just<00:04:53.490> start<00:04:53.640> jumping

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:54.090 
your breath and it'll just start jumping

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:56.090 
your breath and it'll just start jumping
around<00:04:54.180> so<00:04:54.720> it's<00:04:55.260> really<00:04:55.500> hard<00:04:55.770> to<00:04:55.980> get

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:56.100 
around so it's really hard to get

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:58.220 
around so it's really hard to get
accurate<00:04:56.400> hit<00:04:57.090> with<00:04:57.300> it<00:04:57.510> you<00:04:57.720> have<00:04:57.780> to<00:04:58.020> be

00:04:58.220 --> 00:04:58.230 
accurate hit with it you have to be

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:00.680 
accurate hit with it you have to be
practically<00:04:59.220> standing<00:04:59.490> up<00:04:59.850> around<00:05:00.060> no<00:05:00.360> walls

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:00.690 
practically standing up around no walls

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:03.410 
practically standing up around no walls
for<00:05:01.110> to<00:05:01.380> really<00:05:01.680> take<00:05:02.430> full<00:05:02.730> effect<00:05:02.850> or<00:05:03.330> it

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:03.420 
for to really take full effect or it

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:05.870 
for to really take full effect or it
just<00:05:03.450> bounces<00:05:04.110> around<00:05:04.290> and<00:05:04.860> doesn't<00:05:05.820> even

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:05.880 
just bounces around and doesn't even

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:17.100 
just bounces around and doesn't even
stabilize<00:05:06.570> or<00:05:07.200> help<00:05:07.470> you<00:05:07.650> at<00:05:07.920> all

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:06.160 
trying to hit him I guess I got there's

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:08.670 
trying to hit him I guess I got there's
this<00:06:06.430> huge<00:06:06.880> rock<00:06:07.120> kaverin<00:06:07.750> area<00:06:08.139> on<00:06:08.320> the<00:06:08.440> far

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:08.680 
this huge rock kaverin area on the far

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:11.430 
this huge rock kaverin area on the far
left<00:06:08.979> of<00:06:09.100> this<00:06:09.250> map<00:06:09.490> it's<00:06:09.759> pretty<00:06:10.030> cool<00:06:10.440> it

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:11.440 
left of this map it's pretty cool it

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:14.189 
left of this map it's pretty cool it
doesn't<00:06:11.800> really<00:06:11.919> serve<00:06:12.250> a<00:06:12.280> purpose<00:06:12.699> so<00:06:13.199> you

00:06:14.189 --> 00:06:14.199 
doesn't really serve a purpose so you

00:06:14.199 --> 00:06:17.460 
doesn't really serve a purpose so you
can't<00:06:15.160> really<00:06:15.400> sit<00:06:15.970> in<00:06:16.060> it<00:06:16.210> and<00:06:16.360> shoot<00:06:16.630> really

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:17.470 
can't really sit in it and shoot really

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:19.650 
can't really sit in it and shoot really
because<00:06:17.860> you're<00:06:18.250> just<00:06:18.460> in<00:06:18.610> plain<00:06:18.880> sight<00:06:19.330> where
