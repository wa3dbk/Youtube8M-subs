00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:10.950
 yes salvatore finally you do not have 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.230
 had a lot to do you 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.549
 personally tonight when the psg 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.289
 play at this level there is what you 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.660
 think the pg is untouchable 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:21.779
 simply me we are not untouchable 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.760
 we know it's true who we showed 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:27.810
 a very very beautiful attitude today 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:30.060
 games the will the strength to want 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:33.780
 offer you today from us 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.840
 confirm and show who when 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.840
 even 

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:40.930
 it was an accident that's where he got 

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:42.490
 past and well and 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:45.660
 and we had a void and bounce 

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:47.680
 finally is fine then today and 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:51.190
 it is true that they would have facilitated 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:53.500
 for episodes because the cartons 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:55.840
 red spina today and it has 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:58.390
 favored it's true but 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:00.490
 but fortunately it was fine then your 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:02.020
 fans love it when you play 

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:03.340
 this way but he also said 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:04.660
 sometimes psg players they 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:08.080
 choose a little bit their match 

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:09.550
 it is true that no it is not true no le 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.650
 football unfortunately we can only 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:14.590
 choose to play well sometimes you can 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:16.960
 put the will force and life 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:19.150
 especially playing it's true that sometimes 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:21.670
 is you fortunately for us not 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:24.369
 many times it happens when I play 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:25.510
 misinterpreted dice games, but 

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:27.490
 it's also true that it does not happen 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:31.600
 many times to be loaned well and even 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:34.060
 sometimes to do more and to make 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:39.009
 really plating thank you in saving 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:42.160
 anyway the title is getting closer with 

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:43.450
 timothée good face a pg of this level 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.160
 there is nothing to be done frankly 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:47.320
 yeah that's right they did a big 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:49.840
 match this is the first ten minutes where 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:51.220
 there is a big pressing we had trouble in 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:51.430
 go out we took this goal that made us 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:54.789
 wrong 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:56.830
 after we played better until mid 

00:01:54.789 --> 00:02:00.399
 time and now we take this red card 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:01.990
 that really hurts us and that we are 

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:03.340
 a little bit here we have sunk after we have 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:05.470
 been too shy offensively 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:07.569
 so that's after we had a big bet from 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:08.950
 this is the hardest thing 

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:11.200
 ultimately it is that you do rather 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:12.700
 a good match and then facing a roll 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.840
 compressor like that there is nothing to 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:17.170
 do what yeah except the ten 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.150
 first minutes of being squeezed 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.500
 very high 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.790
 we have taken this goal after we have 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:24.670
 started playing we put it to secrecy and 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:26.860
 that some opportunities here are near there 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.330
 we came back in the second half we went 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:30.250
 took that red that made us really 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:31.780
 wrong and that's ten against eleven against 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:34.060
 paris that's not forgiving and they have 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.020
 been realistic and is very loud tonight 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.640
 will be hard for the race to europe 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:38.680
 everyone has won almost before 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.420
 the press not finished there are five matches left 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.739
 now you have to look 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.370
 on the match of troyes that will be 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:45.510
 important sunday 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:45.510
 thanks thimoté
