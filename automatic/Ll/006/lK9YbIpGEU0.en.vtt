these little look like train carts or

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.400 
these little look like train carts or

right on top of that so let me tell you
guys<00:01:03.750> again<00:01:04.369> to<00:01:05.369> do<00:01:05.549> the<00:01:05.700> easiest<00:01:06.240> way<00:01:06.330> to<00:01:06.390> do

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
guys again to do the easiest way to do

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.560 
guys again to do the easiest way to do
this<00:01:06.720> is<00:01:06.930> to<00:01:07.020> basically<00:01:07.770> a<00:01:08.100> press<00:01:09.000> triangle<00:01:09.270> in

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
this is to basically a press triangle in

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.660 
this is to basically a press triangle in
a<00:01:09.689> circle<00:01:10.080> at<00:01:10.140> the<00:01:10.200> same<00:01:10.409> time<00:01:10.619> because<00:01:11.310> that's

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
a circle at the same time because that's

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.520 
a circle at the same time because that's
when<00:01:11.850> you<00:01:11.909> change<00:01:12.119> your<00:01:12.210> button<00:01:13.080> layout<00:01:13.380> to

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
when you change your button layout to

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.649 
when you change your button layout to
tactical<00:01:14.040> and<00:01:14.670> that<00:01:14.790> usually<00:01:15.030> works<00:01:15.330> the<00:01:15.540> best

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
tactical and that usually works the best

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:16.730 
tactical and that usually works the best
because<00:01:15.869> the<00:01:15.960> buttons<00:01:16.110> are<00:01:16.320> right<00:01:16.439> next<00:01:16.619> to

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
because the buttons are right next to

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:17.840 
because the buttons are right next to
each<00:01:16.860> other<00:01:17.009> when<00:01:17.220> you<00:01:17.280> need<00:01:17.460> to<00:01:17.520> charge<00:01:17.729> your

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
each other when you need to charge your

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.940 
each other when you need to charge your
weapon<00:01:18.180> so<00:01:19.020> it's<00:01:19.170> like<00:01:19.320> you<00:01:19.470> have<00:01:19.560> your<00:01:19.619> weapon

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
weapon so it's like you have your weapon

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.219 
weapon so it's like you have your weapon
charged<00:01:20.310> then<00:01:20.909> you're<00:01:21.030> right<00:01:21.240> on<00:01:21.479> the<00:01:21.689> edge<00:01:21.840> of

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
charged then you're right on the edge of

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:23.870 
charged then you're right on the edge of
the<00:01:22.439> cart<00:01:22.710> see<00:01:23.159> I'm<00:01:23.280> changing<00:01:23.640> the<00:01:23.670> back

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
the cart see I'm changing the back

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.460 
the cart see I'm changing the back
changing<00:01:24.840> it<00:01:24.930> right<00:01:25.049> back<00:01:25.170> to<00:01:25.320> default

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
changing it right back to default

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.100 
changing it right back to default
because<00:01:26.130> that's<00:01:26.369> how<00:01:26.490> I<00:01:26.520> play<00:01:26.790> but<00:01:27.570> you<00:01:27.960> do

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
because that's how I play but you do

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.620 
because that's how I play but you do
that<00:01:28.320> and<00:01:28.640> you<00:01:29.640> should<00:01:29.880> be<00:01:29.909> good<00:01:30.000> and<00:01:30.450> just

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
that and you should be good and just

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.840 
that and you should be good and just
focus<00:01:30.960> on<00:01:31.079> the<00:01:31.200> zombie<00:01:31.380> once<00:01:32.220> you<00:01:32.340> once<00:01:32.759> you

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
focus on the zombie once you once you

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.210 
focus on the zombie once you once you
actually<00:01:33.540> a<00:01:33.750> my<00:01:33.930> focus<00:01:34.409> on<00:01:34.530> you<00:01:34.829> hurry<00:01:35.009> up<00:01:35.070> in

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
actually a my focus on you hurry up in

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.770 
actually a my focus on you hurry up in
life<00:01:35.400> and<00:01:35.700> that's<00:01:36.180> when<00:01:36.390> you<00:01:36.450> do<00:01:36.540> your<00:01:36.659> knife

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
life and that's when you do your knife

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.330 
life and that's when you do your knife
lunge<00:01:36.990> glitch<00:01:37.229> and<00:01:37.590> instead<00:01:37.920> of<00:01:37.950> just<00:01:38.189> like

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
lunge glitch and instead of just like

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.530 
lunge glitch and instead of just like
going<00:01:38.549> towards<00:01:38.850> the<00:01:38.909> zombie<00:01:39.240> since<00:01:39.420> you're

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
going towards the zombie since you're

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.240
