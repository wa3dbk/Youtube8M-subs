00:00:01.239 --> 00:00:03.380
 Hello the audience experience 

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:06.380
 sets her voice today with victory over wrestling 

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:09.689
 and you introduce yourself 

00:00:09.689 --> 00:00:11.979
 Let's start with the beaver 

00:00:11.979 --> 00:00:14.979
 our new deliver on percent 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:20.189
 and an extension 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.210
 under the constant as already known 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:25.019
 the remote or the respective sites pages 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.220
 for the one pass easy to eat and make and stainless steel tubes 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:30.800
 why the whole 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.020
 standing with the classes 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.880
 how long can 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:39.880
 there hope the problem 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.400
 Muntwiler 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.130
 and see already 

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:57.150
 this transfer 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:00.020
 that means it is not hatched, not aligned 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:01.300
 is leaking 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:03.570
 do not pull it all tight 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.550
 but have the problem that I have a heavy exhaust system and or one 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:09.210
 has heavy Rosenow 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.730
 Of course, this will never be possible for me 

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:14.220
 that the whole here is perfect with the tides 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.360
 and thus none can provide the will 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.010
 and also not offset is that here 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:22.850
 so to speak to which I mean that 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:24.960
 Systems are too 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.960
 never completely tight 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:33.610
 now you can say so 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:35.520
 9 now wrestle the outer ring 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.520
 in the ring is available here 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.759
 which you may already be beautiful it looks quite normal I still have 

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:47.060
 not attached at all 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:48.760
 Sketche house rented 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:51.760
 and of course not mounted in English had fun 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:01:59.800
 you can see 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:01.450
 the whole is centered 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:03.110
 aligned 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:06.070
 in we also have no protruding edges 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:09.070
 even now only consolidate the whole thing 

00:02:11.649 --> 00:02:14.059
 eight second product 

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:18.579
 Some people see a night session and who is not ours 

00:02:18.579 --> 00:02:21.389
 Put quick release 

00:02:21.389 --> 00:02:24.159
 why the visible progress 

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:25.869
 at the classic chanson 

00:02:25.869 --> 00:02:28.199
 Parity mother 

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:31.419
 the brides descend Mroz 

00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:36.009
 I have to pull it together 

00:02:36.719 --> 00:02:37.939
 the motors 

00:02:37.939 --> 00:02:42.399
 Of course also mounted on the narrowest space which rest at exhaust system Monrose 

00:02:42.399 --> 00:02:44.109
 stayed the same 

00:02:44.109 --> 00:02:47.109
 and now it has to be completely fixed here and here 

00:02:48.839 --> 00:02:51.039
 to be impeccable SID 

00:02:51.039 --> 00:02:54.039
 go all this way 

00:02:55.589 --> 00:02:58.639
 if I imagine now that I'm in the exhaust system Gradauer 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:00.749
 Mosenergo 

00:03:00.749 --> 00:03:03.789
 and dismantle this again and again and go here 

00:03:03.789 --> 00:03:05.979
 the life of time expenditure 

00:03:05.979 --> 00:03:08.349
 the recognition value 

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:11.689
 he compares the train on 9 

00:03:11.689 --> 00:03:14.709
 some similarity influence 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:16.359
 very easily 

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:19.359
 60 is, so to speak 

00:03:20.029 --> 00:03:23.029
 dent 

00:03:25.359 --> 00:03:28.359
 Jeff Lieberman "I'll put it all together and Schillers 

00:03:29.529 --> 00:03:32.769
 Susann Winkel went over you can see it should be easy 

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:36.729
 a days of going back aisles 

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:38.829
 does not speak example 

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:40.019
 so 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:40.760
 and pretty 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.409
 Can I open it all? 

00:03:42.409 --> 00:03:45.400
 I do not have to go all the way back to the kitchen now 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:46.559
 a little bit more 

00:03:46.559 --> 00:03:49.559
 funny as they show in the hole 

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:54.219
 and thus one does not always have an apparent time 

00:03:54.219 --> 00:03:57.229
 All you have to do is save Mio cars with the drivers 

00:03:58.939 --> 00:04:03.129
 and the amount of this system of course also gives the Union 

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:07.659
 Bathroom the polar air systems clothing Broder aluminum exhaust systems 

00:04:08.249 --> 00:04:10.649
 further information below 2 percent of GDP 

00:04:10.649 --> 00:04:12.109
 more bikes will be soon
