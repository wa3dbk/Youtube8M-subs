this<00:01:26.520> when<00:01:26.700> I<00:01:26.729> first<00:01:27.030> saw<00:01:27.390> it<00:01:27.420> was<00:01:27.750> not<00:01:28.619> just

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
this when I first saw it was not just

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.039 
this when I first saw it was not just
the<00:01:28.920> materials<00:01:29.579> they<00:01:29.790> used<00:01:30.090> but<00:01:30.299> also<00:01:30.360> the<00:01:30.869> way

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
the materials they used but also the way

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.870 
the materials they used but also the way
it<00:01:32.009> comes<00:01:32.280> together

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
it comes together

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.090 
it comes together
I<00:01:33.060> love<00:01:33.360> the<00:01:33.509> LED<00:01:33.899> lights<00:01:34.170> on<00:01:34.469> the<00:01:34.619> back<00:01:34.829> and

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
I love the LED lights on the back and

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.249 
I love the LED lights on the back and
it's<00:01:35.219> little<00:01:35.430> touches<00:01:35.610> like<00:01:35.939> that<00:01:36.240> but<00:01:37.229> I

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
it's little touches like that but I

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.190 
it's little touches like that but I
think<00:01:37.380> make<00:01:37.799> battery<00:01:38.189> packs<00:01:38.430> a<00:01:39.360> pleasure<00:01:39.930> to

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
think make battery packs a pleasure to

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.990 
think make battery packs a pleasure to
actually<00:01:40.409> use<00:01:40.920> because<00:01:41.369> a<00:01:41.399> lot<00:01:41.640> of<00:01:41.729> them<00:01:41.880> will

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
actually use because a lot of them will

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.249 
actually use because a lot of them will
be<00:01:42.119> really<00:01:42.390> bulky<00:01:42.750> and<00:01:42.840> you<00:01:42.869> don't<00:01:43.079> actually

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
be really bulky and you don't actually

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:44.780 
be really bulky and you don't actually
like<00:01:43.530> holding<00:01:43.860> them<00:01:44.009> in<00:01:44.100> your<00:01:44.159> hand<00:01:44.399> and<00:01:44.579> in

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
like holding them in your hand and in

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.880 
like holding them in your hand and in
the<00:01:44.850> end<00:01:45.090> I<00:01:45.360> just<00:01:45.990> rather<00:01:46.409> plug<00:01:46.710> my<00:01:46.860> iPhone

I've<00:02:15.810> got<00:02:15.930> four<00:02:16.230> LED<00:02:16.739> strips

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
I've got four LED strips

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.780 
I've got four LED strips
lit<00:02:18.000> up<00:02:18.030> there<00:02:18.530> really<00:02:19.530> nice<00:02:19.800> blue<00:02:20.100> animation

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.120 
lit up there really nice blue animation
it<00:02:20.940> gradually<00:02:21.270> goes<00:02:21.570> up<00:02:21.810> then<00:02:22.560> comes<00:02:22.980> back

it gradually goes up then comes back
down<00:02:23.550> again

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
down again

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:26.540 
down again
I<00:02:24.300> believe<00:02:24.780> in<00:02:25.020> total<00:02:25.470> there<00:02:25.650> are<00:02:25.770> five<00:02:26.040> LEDs

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
I believe in total there are five LEDs

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:29.390 
I believe in total there are five LEDs
so<00:02:26.790> I've<00:02:26.850> got<00:02:26.970> four<00:02:27.180> out<00:02:27.330> of<00:02:27.360> five<00:02:28.040> to<00:02:29.040> pop<00:02:29.250> the

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
so I've got four out of five to pop the

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:34.820 
so I've got four out of five to pop the
case<00:02:29.550> on<00:02:30.350> top<00:02:31.350> part<00:02:31.590> comes<00:02:31.800> off<00:02:33.350> iPhone<00:02:34.350> slides

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
case on top part comes off iPhone slides

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:38.270 
case on top part comes off iPhone slides
in<00:02:35.300> and<00:02:36.300> the<00:02:37.020> top<00:02:37.230> part<00:02:37.500> goes<00:02:37.680> back<00:02:37.950> on<00:02:38.130> again

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
in and the top part goes back on again

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.610

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
again because it's curved it doesn't

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:34.340 
again because it's curved it doesn't
feel<00:03:31.560> too<00:03:31.620> bad<00:03:32.340> in<00:03:32.640> your<00:03:32.790> hand<00:03:33.090> and<00:03:34.050> then<00:03:34.230> your

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:37.550 
microUSB is also in the bottom edge here

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:40.040 
microUSB is also in the bottom edge here
so<00:03:38.550> all<00:03:38.730> in<00:03:38.910> all<00:03:39.000> first<00:03:39.390> impressions<00:03:39.900> are<00:03:40.020> very
