00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
once I saw a really good gameplay in

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:44.120 
once I saw a really good gameplay in
hardcore<00:03:42.630> you<00:03:43.139> know<00:03:43.260> I'd<00:03:43.440> think<00:03:43.739> in<00:03:43.829> my<00:03:43.950> head

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.130 
hardcore you know I'd think in my head

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:45.379 
hardcore you know I'd think in my head
that<00:03:44.370> you<00:03:44.639> know<00:03:44.790> it's<00:03:44.970> really<00:03:45.150> not<00:03:45.329> that

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:45.389 
that you know it's really not that

00:03:45.389 --> 00:03:47.300 
that you know it's really not that
impressive<00:03:45.840> because<00:03:46.139> it's<00:03:46.380> in<00:03:46.530> hardcore<00:03:47.040> and

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
impressive because it's in hardcore and

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:49.460 
impressive because it's in hardcore and
you<00:03:47.880> know<00:03:48.000> I'll<00:03:48.269> do<00:03:48.420> the<00:03:48.569> exact<00:03:48.930> same<00:03:48.959> thing

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:49.470 
you know I'll do the exact same thing

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:51.890 
you know I'll do the exact same thing
and<00:03:49.680> it<00:03:50.220> is<00:03:50.370> kind<00:03:50.730> of<00:03:50.790> judgmental<00:03:51.180> but<00:03:51.540> I<00:03:51.600> don't

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
and it is kind of judgmental but I don't

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.360 
and it is kind of judgmental but I don't
really<00:03:52.049> do<00:03:52.319> that<00:03:52.350> anymore<00:03:52.500> I<00:03:52.829> don't<00:03:52.950> do<00:03:53.190> that

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 
really do that anymore I don't do that

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:57.140 
really do that anymore I don't do that
at<00:03:53.579> all<00:03:53.639> and<00:03:54.090> I<00:03:54.989> think<00:03:55.680> the<00:03:55.889> main<00:03:56.100> key<00:03:56.430> here<00:03:56.819> is

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150 
at all and I think the main key here is

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:59.690 
at all and I think the main key here is
to<00:03:57.209> actually<00:03:57.569> give<00:03:58.079> it<00:03:58.170> a<00:03:58.230> go<00:03:58.410> trihard<00:03:59.160> Cory

00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700 
to actually give it a go trihard Cory

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:01.610 
to actually give it a go trihard Cory
out<00:03:59.850> and<00:04:00.180> then<00:04:00.450> you<00:04:00.870> know<00:04:00.989> you<00:04:01.049> can<00:04:01.319> make<00:04:01.440> your

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:01.620 
out and then you know you can make your

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:03.559 
out and then you know you can make your
judgments<00:04:02.160> or<00:04:02.250> whatever<00:04:02.670> you<00:04:03.180> can<00:04:03.359> say

00:04:03.559 --> 00:04:03.569
