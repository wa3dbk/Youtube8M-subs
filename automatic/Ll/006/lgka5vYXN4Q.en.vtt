00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:24.280
 Hello dear magazine readers 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.460
 favorite cottage 

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:30.640
 I will tell you today or I will give you a few 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:33.730
 tips from on apple trees i think that 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:38.370
 many people ask me a question and many 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:40.660
 moth appears and moths 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.989
 good delicious apples 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:47.350
 they barely take off that now 

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:50.500
 the apple tree has blossomed and it is urgently needed 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:53.370
 take action because now on 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:57.070
 an apple tree will be flown by a pool butterfly 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:01:01.170
 moth and she lays eggs on 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:04.750
 a piece of these eggs after 12 days 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.010
 the caterpillars of j come out 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:09.310
 the apple tree has blossomed 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:10.240
 apples come from the ovary of the attack 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:15.670
 apples 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:19.150
 and already the caterpillars climb inside 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:23.610
 an apple and starts to eat seed 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:29.100
 camera seeds and of course such apples 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:34.230
 gives rotting and them and with that the caterpillars they 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:38.980
 damage these apples for 30 days 

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:41.220
 imagine how much they eat spoils 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:45.070
 apples and more so 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:48.880
 each caterpillar somewhere hurts three 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:52.690
 apples and hundreds of them now imagine 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:55.380
 how much we don't get a harvest like me 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:02:00.970
 now I want to give such advice 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:03.690
 first here take a jar any jar 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:05.910
 Better half a liter at home such a jar 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:09.099
 pour in there 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:11.830
 apple juice from delicious sweet 

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:14.080
 apple juice which is sold in 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:17.769
 the store yes and you probably have in 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:20.620
 basement apple juice and if juice you are not 

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:21.220
 will find you cook apple compote 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:25.120
 his 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:28.800
 . add sugar point so sweet and here 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:31.540
 a jar of compote is not necessary full 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:34.330
 better in general this big jar is better 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:38.080
 take half a liter or half liter 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:40.240
 jar there will fly a butterfly she 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:44.650
 won't sit on a piece of paper 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:48.400
 and will fly into a jar and lots and 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:50.950
 and will be there and so we with 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:55.000
 the butterfly will fight but remember 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:58.180
 dear readers need this one 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:01.120
 a jar not on an apple tree in odzak 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:05.620
 precisely on another tree well or far 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:08.700
 somewhere in the three meters 4 from the tree 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:11.180
 you never know there can be near viburnum there 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:14.359
 bird cherry 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:17.299
 regina other cultures cherry 

00:03:14.359 --> 00:03:19.519
 here and tie this bath here 

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:23.329
 the main thing that these butterflies will be less 

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:26.689
 sits on the apple tree itself and the second method 

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:30.709
 so that the apple tree was still clean little 

00:03:26.689 --> 00:03:35.560
 it was necessary to sprinkle pests at all 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:38.030
 a very simple solution to prepare 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:41.989
 because this solution 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:45.739
 It will help you not only to overcome this one 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:49.310
 moth caterpillar butterfly 

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:53.769
 but also aphids and there will be no others 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:57.560
 pests take 10 liters of water dilute 

00:03:53.769 --> 00:04:00.739
 somewhere 40 grams of karbofos not 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:04.040
 worry this so common with 

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:07.489
 Iâ€™m working at it for 20 years and 2 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:10.639
 tablespoons soap green or 

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:14.209
 tar tar I need right so 

00:04:10.639 --> 00:04:19.579
 here will wash already apples that is 

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:22.909
 after flowering and questionnaires and this this 

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:28.510
 the solution is really very effective 

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:28.510
 and almost no vermin pests
