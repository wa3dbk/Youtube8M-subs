00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:13.500

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:15.809
 donatela lapa o g and the background that I 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.490
 I passed the silver that is the little tock 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.250
 of tough enamel 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.240
 I'm picking up the fine brush 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.880
 Details 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:31.160
 I looked at the brush as you can see 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:35.969
 with the paint and I'll make a half circle 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:37.410
 nail can pick up the entire nail from a 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:41.219

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:43.850

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:30.470
 on top of the ear 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:32.320
 on the other side the little ear here is already 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:35.810

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:41.780

 I'm going to make a half circle. 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:23.620
 I'll use the same brush already, make one 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:23.620

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:33.000
 to do is squeeze too much as the ink comes out 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:37.170

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:58.350

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:14.550
 I'll make a laugh with a black one. 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:18.299

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:20.430
