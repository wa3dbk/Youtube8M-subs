cylinder<00:02:15.140> it's<00:02:15.860> got<00:02:16.160> a<00:02:16.190> spring<00:02:16.459> behind<00:02:16.700> it<00:02:16.940> so

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
cylinder it's got a spring behind it so

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:18.340 
cylinder it's got a spring behind it so
it's<00:02:17.150> automatically<00:02:17.600> going<00:02:17.780> to<00:02:17.840> push<00:02:18.019> itself

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:18.350 
it's automatically going to push itself

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:20.590 
it's automatically going to push itself
back<00:02:18.590> out<00:02:18.970> so<00:02:19.970> you're<00:02:20.120> going<00:02:20.239> to<00:02:20.269> tilt<00:02:20.510> your

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:20.600 
back out so you're going to tilt your

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:21.670 
back out so you're going to tilt your
bars<00:02:20.810> a<00:02:20.900> little<00:02:21.019> bit<00:02:21.200> because<00:02:21.290> these<00:02:21.440> mats

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
bars a little bit because these mats

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.110 
bars a little bit because these mats
owners<00:02:22.010> don't<00:02:22.130> hold<00:02:22.340> a<00:02:22.430> lot<00:02:22.550> of<00:02:22.580> fluid<00:02:23.000> they're

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
owners don't hold a lot of fluid they're

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.540 
owners don't hold a lot of fluid they're
pretty<00:02:23.330> shallow<00:02:23.569> so<00:02:23.959> till<00:02:24.650> your<00:02:24.800> bars<00:02:24.980> towards

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:25.550 
pretty shallow so till your bars towards

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:27.130 
pretty shallow so till your bars towards
the<00:02:25.700> hole<00:02:25.880> that<00:02:26.450> it's<00:02:26.569> going<00:02:26.720> to<00:02:26.780> pump<00:02:26.959> through

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
the hole that it's going to pump through

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:30.070 
the hole that it's going to pump through
so<00:02:27.920> that<00:02:28.100> way<00:02:28.190> doesn't<00:02:28.540> draw<00:02:29.540> any<00:02:29.569> air<00:02:29.930> in

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 
so that way doesn't draw any air in

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.380 
so that way doesn't draw any air in
they're<00:02:30.700> just<00:02:31.700> going<00:02:31.790> to<00:02:31.850> do<00:02:31.940> that<00:02:32.060> a<00:02:32.120> few

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
they're just going to do that a few

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:35.620 
they're just going to do that a few
times<00:02:32.420> see<00:02:33.230> if<00:02:33.290> you<00:02:33.440> get<00:02:33.560> any<00:02:34.209> any<00:02:35.209> air<00:02:35.390> coming

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:35.630 
times see if you get any any air coming

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:41.420 
times see if you get any any air coming
out<00:02:35.840> of<00:02:35.870> there

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.830 

I'm<00:02:42.430> getting<00:02:42.670> a<00:02:42.730> few<00:02:42.910> bubbles<00:02:43.090> here<00:02:43.510> this

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
I'm getting a few bubbles here this

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.710 
I'm getting a few bubbles here this
bikes<00:02:44.110> pretty<00:02:44.530> new<00:02:44.770> but<00:02:45.209> it's<00:02:46.209> pretty<00:02:46.420> hard<00:02:46.599> to

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
bikes pretty new but it's pretty hard to

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.710 
bikes pretty new but it's pretty hard to
get<00:02:47.160> the<00:02:48.160> air<00:02:48.310> trap<00:02:48.610> from<00:02:49.060> out<00:02:49.239> of<00:02:49.360> there<00:02:49.480> just

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
get the air trap from out of there just

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:52.650 
get the air trap from out of there just
by<00:02:49.840> regularly<00:02:50.230> bleeding<00:02:50.650> it<00:02:51.330> so<00:02:52.330> once<00:02:52.510> it's

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
by regularly bleeding it so once it's

00:02:52.660 --> 00:03:00.360 
by regularly bleeding it so once it's
already<00:02:52.810> bled<00:02:53.140> up<00:02:53.910> you<00:02:54.910> can<00:02:55.440> perform<00:02:59.370> I'm

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.370 
already bled up you can perform I'm

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:02.570 
already bled up you can perform I'm
actually<00:03:00.520> going<00:03:00.790> to<00:03:00.880> throw<00:03:01.000> a<00:03:01.090> little<00:03:01.390> bit<00:03:01.510> of

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
actually going to throw a little bit of

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:04.830 
actually going to throw a little bit of
fluid<00:03:03.580> in<00:03:03.819> it<00:03:03.940> it<00:03:04.060> seems<00:03:04.209> to<00:03:04.330> be<00:03:04.480> a<00:03:04.510> little<00:03:04.690> bit

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840 
fluid in it it seems to be a little bit

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:05.690 
fluid in it it seems to be a little bit
lower<00:03:04.989> now

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
lower now

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:11.040 
lower now
so<00:03:06.700> we'll<00:03:06.940> top<00:03:07.420> that<00:03:07.630> off<00:03:09.780> doesn't<00:03:10.780> hold<00:03:10.900> that

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:11.050 
so we'll top that off doesn't hold that

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:14.509 
so we'll top that off doesn't hold that
much<00:03:11.290> so<00:03:11.670> it<00:03:12.670> overflows<00:03:13.180> pretty<00:03:13.600> easily<00:03:13.810> so

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:14.519 
much so it overflows pretty easily so

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:16.759 
much so it overflows pretty easily so
pull<00:03:15.519> it<00:03:15.549> up<00:03:15.670> to<00:03:15.819> that<00:03:15.970> right<00:03:16.150> there

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:16.769 
pull it up to that right there

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:18.780 
pull it up to that right there
and<00:03:17.769> then<00:03:17.860> we're<00:03:17.950> going<00:03:18.040> to<00:03:18.130> replace<00:03:18.400> the

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790 
and then we're going to replace the

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:28.370 
and then we're going to replace the
slave<00:03:19.480> cover<00:03:20.519> here<00:03:21.519> put<00:03:21.910> your<00:03:21.940> gasket<00:03:22.420> on<00:03:22.540> here

you're<00:03:29.380> just<00:03:29.410> going<00:03:29.650> to<00:03:30.269> slip<00:03:31.269> it<00:03:31.450> on<00:03:31.630> man<00:03:31.870> like

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:32.080 
you're just going to slip it on man like

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:34.830 
you're just going to slip it on man like

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.600 
that cousin there pretty easy you don't
want<00:03:34.959> to<00:03:35.049> force<00:03:36.040> it<00:03:36.220> in<00:03:36.310> there

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:36.610 
want to force it in there

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:38.750 
want to force it in there
it<00:03:36.670> should<00:03:37.060> you<00:03:37.450> should<00:03:37.540> feel<00:03:37.780> the<00:03:37.930> pressure

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:41.500 
come back to you if you try to force it

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:44.880 
come back to you if you try to force it

and line it up with the hole make sure
it<00:04:24.949> gets<00:04:25.270> through<00:04:26.270> the<00:04:26.419> slave<00:04:26.630> cylinder<00:04:26.870> so<00:04:27.680> I

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:27.710 
it gets through the slave cylinder so I

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:29.170 
it gets through the slave cylinder so I
left<00:04:27.949> those<00:04:28.099> loose<00:04:28.340> so<00:04:28.490> it<00:04:28.550> can<00:04:28.699> move<00:04:28.849> just<00:04:29.060> a

left those loose so it can move just a

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:32.610 
left those loose so it can move just a
bit<00:04:29.349> tighten<00:04:30.349> it<00:04:30.470> down<00:04:30.530> and<00:04:30.940> again<00:04:31.940> there's

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:32.620 
bit tighten it down and again there's

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:35.969 
bit tighten it down and again there's
torque<00:04:33.620> specs<00:04:33.889> in<00:04:34.099> the<00:04:34.250> manual<00:04:34.940> for<00:04:35.539> these

00:04:35.969 --> 00:04:35.979 
torque specs in the manual for these

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:41.080 
torque specs in the manual for these
refer<00:04:36.979> to<00:04:37.009> that<00:04:39.759> and<00:04:40.759> now<00:04:40.880> that<00:04:41.000> I'm

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:41.090 
refer to that and now that I'm

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:41.980 
refer to that and now that I'm
tightening<00:04:41.330> these<00:04:41.479> that's<00:04:41.660> pushing<00:04:41.870> the

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:41.990 
tightening these that's pushing the

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:43.990 
tightening these that's pushing the
piston<00:04:42.229> in<00:04:42.470> so<00:04:42.560> it<00:04:42.680> is<00:04:42.740> going<00:04:42.919> to<00:04:42.979> allow<00:04:43.759> some

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:44.000 
piston in so it is going to allow some

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.140 
piston in so it is going to allow some
fluid<00:04:44.330> to<00:04:44.419> come<00:04:44.570> back<00:04:44.780> through<00:04:44.990> there<00:04:45.520> so<00:04:46.520> just

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:47.150 
fluid to come back through there so just

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:49.459 
fluid to come back through there so just
take<00:04:47.300> a<00:04:47.330> towel<00:04:47.570> and<00:04:47.599> we'll<00:04:47.840> wipe<00:04:47.990> that<00:04:48.139> up

00:04:49.459 --> 00:04:49.469 
take a towel and we'll wipe that up

00:04:49.469 --> 00:04:52.879 
take a towel and we'll wipe that up
now<00:04:50.399> we've<00:04:50.580> got<00:04:50.729> those<00:04:50.939> tightened<00:04:51.330> down<00:04:51.889> just

00:04:52.879 --> 00:04:52.889 
now we've got those tightened down just

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:55.939 
now we've got those tightened down just
want<00:04:53.009> to<00:04:53.099> grab<00:04:53.249> a<00:04:53.279> 10<00:04:53.639> mil<00:04:53.879> and<00:04:54.679> from<00:04:55.679> the<00:04:55.800> other

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:49.020 
and now the flu is going to try to

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:54.770 
and now the flu is going to try to
squish<00:05:49.320> out<00:05:49.500> the<00:05:49.650> side<00:05:51.680> so<00:05:53.690> tighten<00:05:54.690> those

squish out the side so tighten those

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:56.120 
squish out the side so tighten those
down<00:05:54.840> now<00:05:55.140> this<00:05:55.290> is<00:05:55.440> aluminum<00:05:55.740> to<00:05:56.100> aluminum

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:56.130 
down now this is aluminum to aluminum

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:57.800 
down now this is aluminum to aluminum
you're<00:05:56.610> tightening<00:05:56.910> to<00:05:57.090> so<00:05:57.270> it<00:05:57.420> doesn't<00:05:57.720> have

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:57.810 
you're tightening to so it doesn't have

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:00.410 
you're tightening to so it doesn't have
to<00:05:57.960> be<00:05:58.080> super<00:05:58.410> tight<00:05:58.670> you'll<00:05:59.670> feel<00:05:59.940> it<00:06:00.090> pretty

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:00.420 
to be super tight you'll feel it pretty

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:03.500 
to be super tight you'll feel it pretty
much<00:06:00.600> stop<00:06:00.980> so<00:06:01.980> just<00:06:02.820> snug<00:06:03.060> them<00:06:03.210> up<00:06:03.270> just

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:03.510 
much stop so just snug them up just

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:05.300 
much stop so just snug them up just
after<00:06:03.660> that<00:06:03.990> and<00:06:04.230> then<00:06:04.740> you're<00:06:04.890> good<00:06:05.040> to<00:06:05.070> go

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:05.310 
after that and then you're good to go

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:08.060 
after that and then you're good to go
there<00:06:05.750> clean<00:06:06.750> up<00:06:06.870> any<00:06:07.050> excess<00:06:07.140> fluid<00:06:07.860> because

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:08.070 
there clean up any excess fluid because

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:10.520 
there clean up any excess fluid because
usually<00:06:08.820> the<00:06:09.180> red<00:06:09.660> fluid<00:06:10.020> likes<00:06:10.200> to<00:06:10.320> eat<00:06:10.440> away

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:10.530 
usually the red fluid likes to eat away

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:13.280 
usually the red fluid likes to eat away
some<00:06:10.830> paint<00:06:11.100> so<00:06:11.910> just<00:06:12.150> as<00:06:12.270> a<00:06:12.300> precaution<00:06:12.510> clean

that all up

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:17.180

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:21.450 
brake cleaner it works pretty well even

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:25.070 
brake cleaner it works pretty well even
even<00:06:22.050> a<00:06:22.110> bottle<00:06:22.410> of<00:06:22.500> water<00:06:23.660> it's<00:06:24.660> good<00:06:24.900> too

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:25.080 
even a bottle of water it's good too

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:27.860 
even a bottle of water it's good too
