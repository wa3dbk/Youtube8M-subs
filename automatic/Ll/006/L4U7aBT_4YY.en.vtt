00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.069
 it was longer wide and tall but 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:11.219
 continued 911 to reinvent this mythical 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:15.269
 model by changing or perfecting almost 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:17.910
 90% of the components was no easy task 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:20.910
 but the engineers and stylists of 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.840
 Porsche show what they are capable of 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.109
 capable 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:27.779
 to perfect what was already good without 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.619
 fill what has been successful for almost 50 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.369
 years 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:34.340
 the unmistakable style of the 911 tradition 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:40.739
 can never be forgotten in a car 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:42.840
 on the left side as well as the 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.250
 table of instruments where you count turns 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.590
 bi in the center 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.660
 the finishing done with the rigid style 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.239
 Germanic materials of first 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.460
 quality and finishes note 10 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.860
 this without counting the air stewardships 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.920
 automatic central control 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:01.109
 with gps rights and south of 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.600
 very high quality in a charming 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.369
 stopwatch on the panel that 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.380
 besides indicating the hours allows 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.869
 you set your time on the turns of a 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.180
 autodrome in case he has fun 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.900
 took that air of nostalgia is a two 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.240
 two more 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:19.049
 that is, there is room for four but there 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:21.000
 behind only two children look good in 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:23.700
 both the driver and the driver. 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.590
 companions enjoy more space 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.350
 which allows long trips with more 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.670
 comfort thing that banks in the form of 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.490
 shell broaden 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:35.640
 but the great porsche 911 a 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:38.579
 mechanics the light engine stays behind 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.470
 unite but if this configuration allows 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:42.630
 rage of scary 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.570
 the electronic paraphernalia of controls 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.159
 of vector stability and traction 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.780
 in charge of putting the house in order 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:52.850
 when someone abuse 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:54.140
 there are two levels beyond normal sport 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:57.350
 and sport plus 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:59.110
 in fact the odor changes along with the 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:02.060
 hardening of the shock absorbers 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:04.940
 electronic and assembly management 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.950
 engine is that work of art that is the 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:10.160
 motor 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:12.050
 we do not see it anymore because the 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.870
 followed by well-deserved contrasts 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:17.090
 appear and if it shows progress 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:19.910
 when accelerated normally the 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:22.130
 likely with the people to get their heads 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:24.440
 together with the automated exchange of 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:27.050
 seven gears and double clutch with 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:29.990
 automatic or manual changes in the letters 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:32.900
 and lever and selecting the sport mode 

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:34.520
 plus has formed a partnership that allows a 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:39.010
 disagreement and piano 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:42.489
 when using with the aid of an airfoil 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:44.680
 I always believe I say now it seems 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:47.680
 Are you driving on rails? 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:50.470
 the starts are fantastic and if I go 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:55.480
 stop accelerating will go from 300 per 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:03:00.790
 hour and can walk the streets as 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:01.540
 It costs that strong 911 race s 639 thousand 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:03.790
 real 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:06.870
 but I wanted to try 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:06.870
 put this little piece together
