00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
because you know you have to aim really

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:55.370 
because you know you have to aim really
high<00:03:53.340> with<00:03:53.519> it<00:03:53.670> but<00:03:53.910> you<00:03:54.150> know<00:03:54.570> it's<00:03:54.780> it's<00:03:54.989> fair

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:55.380 
high with it but you know it's it's fair

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:57.259 
high with it but you know it's it's fair
hopefully<00:03:56.070> they<00:03:56.160> don't<00:03:56.280> patch<00:03:56.610> the<00:03:56.820> snipers

00:03:57.259 --> 00:03:57.269 
hopefully they don't patch the snipers

00:03:57.269 --> 00:03:59.180 
hopefully they don't patch the snipers
this<00:03:57.390> time<00:03:57.630> and<00:03:57.900> they've<00:03:58.650> actually<00:03:58.829> passed

00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.190 
this time and they've actually passed

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:01.009 
this time and they've actually passed
the<00:03:59.340> snipers<00:03:59.670> in<00:03:59.700> both<00:04:00.030> black<00:04:00.269> ops<00:04:00.570> 1<00:04:00.660> and

00:04:01.009 --> 00:04:01.019 
the snipers in both black ops 1 and

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:03.170 
the snipers in both black ops 1 and
black<00:04:01.200> ops<00:04:01.440> 2<00:04:01.709> in<00:04:02.130> black<00:04:02.430> ops<00:04:02.640> 1<00:04:02.730> they<00:04:02.940> made<00:04:03.090> it

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
black ops 2 in black ops 1 they made it

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.360 
black ops 2 in black ops 1 they made it
so<00:04:03.299> the<00:04:03.450> sway<00:04:03.720> was<00:04:03.930> ridiculous<00:04:04.620> they<00:04:05.130> didn't

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370 
so the sway was ridiculous they didn't

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.789 
so the sway was ridiculous they didn't
mess<00:04:05.489> with<00:04:05.549> that<00:04:05.760> the<00:04:06.630> reload<00:04:07.019> time<00:04:07.049> but<00:04:07.590> in

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:07.799 
mess with that the reload time but in

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:09.949 
mess with that the reload time but in
black<00:04:08.040> ops<00:04:08.220> 2<00:04:08.340> they<00:04:08.700> mess<00:04:09.000> hardcore<00:04:09.660> with<00:04:09.870> the

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:09.959 
black ops 2 they mess hardcore with the

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:11.599 
black ops 2 they mess hardcore with the
reload<00:04:10.230> time<00:04:10.260> if<00:04:10.650> you<00:04:10.769> don't<00:04:10.980> if<00:04:11.280> you<00:04:11.489> weren't

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:11.609 
reload time if you don't if you weren't

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:14.030 
reload time if you don't if you weren't
around<00:04:11.850> during<00:04:12.209> that<00:04:12.359> time<00:04:12.600> they<00:04:13.410> they<00:04:13.709> messed

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 
around during that time they they messed

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:17.180 
around during that time they they messed
up<00:04:14.280> the<00:04:14.340> DSR<00:04:15.209> so<00:04:15.720> bad<00:04:16.169> that<00:04:16.380> gun<00:04:16.560> was<00:04:16.590> so<00:04:16.890> fun<00:04:17.160> to

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.190 
up the DSR so bad that gun was so fun to

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:18.770 
up the DSR so bad that gun was so fun to
use<00:04:17.459> I<00:04:17.640> was<00:04:17.760> such<00:04:17.940> a<00:04:17.970> good<00:04:18.150> sniper<00:04:18.330> with<00:04:18.599> it

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:18.780 
use I was such a good sniper with it

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:19.810 
use I was such a good sniper with it
until<00:04:18.959> they

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:19.820 
until they

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:21.970 
until they
did<00:04:20.210> the<00:04:20.330> whole<00:04:20.480> patch<00:04:20.720> thing<00:04:21.080> I<00:04:21.470> mean<00:04:21.860> I'm

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:21.980 
did the whole patch thing I mean I'm

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:23.940 
did the whole patch thing I mean I'm
still<00:04:22.160> a<00:04:22.220> good<00:04:22.340> sniper<00:04:22.580> with<00:04:22.910> it<00:04:23.060> but<00:04:23.240> you<00:04:23.360> know

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:23.950

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:27.550 
still a good sniper with it but you know
how<00:04:24.950> long<00:04:25.250> it<00:04:25.370> takes<00:04:25.580> two<00:04:25.870> cock<00:04:26.870> back<00:04:27.110> that<00:04:27.350> gun

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:27.560

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:29.620 
how long it takes two cock back that gun
is<00:04:27.770> ridiculous<00:04:28.490> it's<00:04:28.520> horrible<00:04:29.210> and<00:04:29.360> let<00:04:29.570> me
