00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:27.599
 so the subwoofer pioneer 210 model 

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:32.449
 now unpack it here too 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:32.449
 wires for connecting the attachment 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.770
 remote control 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:50.280
 two regulators . pretty long cord 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:53.030
 a few meters so this is some kind of 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.030
 mounts 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:11.130
 cold and subwoofer plastic case 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:18.840
 pretty tight 

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:25.649
 nothing rattles weighty so heavy 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:28.210
 so here is the bottom wall some kind of rough 

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:34.000
 pretty rough plastic probably so 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:37.869
 he slid the subwoofer round nothing 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:43.149
 Do not what again this see mount 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:49.240
 in order for u to set with the time is difficult 

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:55.110
 and put it here we have a connector and for 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:58.860
 audio input console connections 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:01.390
 also visible for mounting holes in 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:06.399
 I feel like this part 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:08.319
 after all iron is plastic 

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:10.539
 because some kind of cold there 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:16.319
 warm from the cold part know nipples 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:19.569
 iron but we will do it yourself that you will not understand 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:20.489
 weighty decent Sabuhi subwoofer 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:24.430
 small 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:27.910
 do not know for comparison if you compare 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:30.510
 bottles of the same class is enough 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:30.510
 little 

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:37.900
 Well, let's see how he will be himself 

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:37.900
 drive in the car
