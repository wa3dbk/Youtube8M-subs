to<00:00:22.320> target<00:00:22.769> our<00:00:22.920> forearms<00:00:23.519> often<00:00:23.850> hitting

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
to target our forearms often hitting

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.060 
to target our forearms often hitting
them<00:00:24.510> as<00:00:24.689> a<00:00:24.750> secondary<00:00:25.320> muscle<00:00:25.680> either<00:00:25.890> with

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
them as a secondary muscle either with

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.580 
them as a secondary muscle either with
our<00:00:26.160> back<00:00:26.369> or<00:00:26.689> biceps<00:00:27.689> but<00:00:27.960> if<00:00:28.050> you<00:00:28.170> really

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
our back or biceps but if you really

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.589 
our back or biceps but if you really
want<00:00:28.769> to<00:00:28.890> build<00:00:29.070> the<00:00:29.640> perfect<00:00:29.820> physique<00:00:30.240> you

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
want to build the perfect physique you

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.420 
want to build the perfect physique you
have<00:00:31.140> to<00:00:31.260> put<00:00:31.410> the<00:00:31.500> time<00:00:31.710> in<00:00:31.859> on<00:00:32.040> the<00:00:32.160> smaller

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
have to put the time in on the smaller

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.120 
have to put the time in on the smaller
muscle<00:00:32.759> groups<00:00:32.940> forearms<00:00:33.899> calves<00:00:34.469> and<00:00:34.770> even

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
muscle groups forearms calves and even

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.370 
muscle groups forearms calves and even
places<00:00:35.520> like<00:00:35.700> the<00:00:35.969> rear<00:00:36.120> deltoids<00:00:36.570> so<00:00:37.140> these

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
places like the rear deltoids so these

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.470 
places like the rear deltoids so these
four<00:00:37.680> exercises<00:00:38.010> can<00:00:38.640> be<00:00:38.700> done<00:00:38.790> as<00:00:39.090> part<00:00:39.270> of<00:00:39.360> an

00:00:44.889 --> 00:00:44.899 
forearm workout and the first exercise

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:48.260 
forearm workout and the first exercise
standing<00:00:45.899> Olympic<00:00:46.649> curls<00:00:46.890> so<00:00:47.579> we<00:00:47.700> stand<00:00:47.879> in

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
standing Olympic curls so we stand in

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:54.680 
standing Olympic curls so we stand in
front<00:00:48.780> of<00:00:48.989> the<00:00:49.140> bar<00:00:51.230> overhand<00:00:52.230> grip<00:00:53.690> arms

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
front of the bar overhand grip arms

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.540 
front of the bar overhand grip arms
fully<00:00:55.050> straight<00:00:55.350> so<00:00:55.530> no<00:00:55.710> bend<00:00:55.949> in<00:00:56.160> the<00:00:56.280> elbow

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
fully straight so no bend in the elbow

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.580 
fully straight so no bend in the elbow
and<00:00:56.760> then<00:00:58.160> curl<00:00:59.160> the<00:00:59.280> bar<00:00:59.430> up<00:01:00.289> allowing<00:01:01.289> it<00:01:01.530> to

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
and then curl the bar up allowing it to

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.130 
and then curl the bar up allowing it to
really<00:01:01.949> stretch<00:01:02.309> down<00:01:02.579> even<00:01:03.570> going<00:01:03.750> as<00:01:03.840> far<00:01:03.870> as

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
really stretch down even going as far as

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.410 
really stretch down even going as far as
opening<00:01:04.500> up<00:01:04.589> the<00:01:04.739> fingers<00:01:05.330> removing<00:01:06.330> the

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
opening up the fingers removing the

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.830 
opening up the fingers removing the
thumb<00:01:06.659> from<00:01:06.900> the<00:01:06.990> bar<00:01:08.299> so<00:01:09.299> the<00:01:09.390> forearms

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
thumb from the bar so the forearms

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.410 
thumb from the bar so the forearms
really<00:01:10.530> need<00:01:10.650> to<00:01:10.770> hit<00:01:10.920> them<00:01:11.100> with<00:01:11.420> similar

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
really need to hit them with similar

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.539 
really need to hit them with similar
intensity<00:01:12.990> to<00:01:13.170> cops<00:01:13.439> which<00:01:13.920> basically<00:01:14.280> means

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
intensity to cops which basically means

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.710 
intensity to cops which basically means
high<00:01:15.030> volume<00:01:15.450> and<00:01:15.630> heavy<00:01:16.470> weight<00:01:17.150> but<00:01:18.150> it<00:01:18.360> is<00:01:18.479> a

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
high volume and heavy weight but it is a

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:19.940 
high volume and heavy weight but it is a
small<00:01:18.990> muscle<00:01:19.170> group<00:01:19.320> so<00:01:19.590> you<00:01:19.619> don't<00:01:19.770> want<00:01:19.890> to

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
small muscle group so you don't want to

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:30.940 
small muscle group so you don't want to
overload<00:01:20.250> it<00:01:20.400> too<00:01:20.549> much

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:30.950 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:33.680 

now<00:01:31.950> to<00:01:32.010> keep<00:01:32.310> things<00:01:32.490> moving<00:01:32.880> without<00:01:33.180> taking

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:33.690 
now to keep things moving without taking

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:35.480 
now to keep things moving without taking
much<00:01:33.870> rest<00:01:34.200> we're<00:01:34.740> going<00:01:34.860> to<00:01:34.920> come<00:01:35.040> over<00:01:35.280> and

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
much rest we're going to come over and

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:38.720 
now about a half an inch thick keep them
in<00:02:33.300> our<00:02:33.420> hands<00:02:35.060> around<00:02:36.500> the<00:02:37.500> chin<00:02:37.710> up<00:02:37.830> bar<00:02:37.980> now

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
in our hands around the chin up bar now

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.280 
in our hands around the chin up bar now
with<00:02:38.940> this<00:02:39.090> wider<00:02:39.360> grip<00:02:39.630> it's<00:02:39.870> really<00:02:40.140> going

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
with this wider grip it's really going

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.080 
with this wider grip it's really going
to<00:02:40.350> force<00:02:40.560> our<00:02:40.740> forearms<00:02:41.220> to<00:02:41.580> have<00:02:41.730> to<00:02:41.880> grip

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
to force our forearms to have to grip

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.510 
to force our forearms to have to grip
harder<00:02:42.480> forcing<00:02:43.230> them<00:02:43.350> to<00:02:43.380> work<00:02:43.520> more

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:44.520 
harder forcing them to work more

00:02:44.520 --> 00:03:01.360 
harder forcing them to work more
intensely

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:03.800 

now<00:03:02.370> as<00:03:02.610> I<00:03:02.730> always<00:03:02.849> say<00:03:03.060> with<00:03:03.209> body<00:03:03.480> weighted

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
now as I always say with body weighted

we're<00:03:22.530> going<00:03:22.650> to<00:03:22.709> rotate<00:03:22.829> the<00:03:23.159> hands<00:03:23.430> up<00:03:23.579> and

we're going to rotate the hands up and
all<00:03:24.780> the<00:03:24.900> way<00:03:24.989> back<00:03:25.019> down<00:03:25.409> so<00:03:27.379> two<00:03:28.379> things<00:03:28.769> need

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
all the way back down so two things need

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:31.130 
all the way back down so two things need
to<00:03:29.010> happen<00:03:29.159> here<00:03:29.579> first<00:03:30.030> you<00:03:30.359> need<00:03:30.900> to<00:03:30.930> take

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140 
to happen here first you need to take

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:32.509 
to happen here first you need to take
the<00:03:31.260> muscle<00:03:31.590> through<00:03:31.799> its<00:03:31.980> full<00:03:32.190> range<00:03:32.250> of

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:32.519 
the muscle through its full range of

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:36.319 
the muscle through its full range of
motion<00:03:33.409> that<00:03:34.409> means<00:03:34.879> knuckles<00:03:35.879> all<00:03:36.150> the<00:03:36.239> way

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:36.329 
motion that means knuckles all the way

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:38.809 
motion that means knuckles all the way
up<00:03:36.480> and<00:03:36.859> all<00:03:37.859> the<00:03:37.950> way<00:03:38.040> down<00:03:38.220> to<00:03:38.430> stretch<00:03:38.639> it

00:03:38.809 --> 00:03:38.819 
up and all the way down to stretch it

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:42.410 
up and all the way down to stretch it
out<00:03:38.909> and<00:03:39.500> secondly<00:03:40.500> to<00:03:40.980> grow<00:03:41.190> them<00:03:41.400> need<00:03:42.180> some

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420 
out and secondly to grow them need some

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:44.839 
out and secondly to grow them need some
kind<00:03:42.599> of<00:03:42.659> stimuli<00:03:43.109> to<00:03:43.349> overload<00:03:44.340> the<00:03:44.489> muscle

00:03:44.839 --> 00:03:44.849 
kind of stimuli to overload the muscle

00:03:44.849 --> 00:04:01.650
