00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:22.480
 many legends of the world in ancient written 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:26.110
 sources tells us about the giants 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:28.329
 giants and titans often tell us 

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:29.140
 finds in various corners of the earth 

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:32.770
 of the ball 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:35.620
 skeletons of people of abnormal growth so 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:37.899
 could our ancestors be giants 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:40.390
 there are some incredible 

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:42.670
 archaeological discoveries which 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:48.190
 make you think about it seriously 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:51.000
 issue in 2005 in the desert of sugar 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:54.579
 Stone Age burials discovered 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:59.140
 age of remains is about 5000 years 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:01:01.780
 in just two years from 2005 to 2006 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:05.079
 about 200 similar were found 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:07.860
 burials and all of them are distinguished by high 

00:01:05.079 --> 00:01:10.600
 height more than two meters 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:13.320
 also giant fossils were 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:16.630
 found in Turkey bone human feet 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:19.530
 has a length of 120 centimeters 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:21.640
 based on this person's height 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:26.710
 supposedly was supposed to be 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:29.350
 not less than 5 meters in the Australian cave 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:33.159
 and anthropologists have found a petrified tooth 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:36.310
 7 high and 5 centimeters wide by 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:39.580
 To the calculations, the owner of the tooth should also 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:41.490
 have a height of more than 5 meters and weigh 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:45.640
 about 300 kilograms 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:49.780
 analysis determined that the age of finding 9 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:52.450
 million years in one of the caves of morocco 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:55.479
 discovered jaw but despite 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:57.010
 similar to human size found 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:02:00.520
 bones it seems 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:02.590
 abnormally large in some 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.619
 enthusiasts suggests 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:07.450
 that all the main monuments of antiquity 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.379
 such as the Egyptian pyramids and 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:11.349
 stonehenge 

00:02:08.379 --> 00:02:13.840
 and the sphinx were built by these very 

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:15.790
 by giants also according to some 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:20.220
 scientists giants 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:22.510
 this is the previous namura himself 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:25.090
 evidence of the remains 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:26.110
 giants are found in almost every 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:29.170
 parts of the world 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:31.480
 such as mexico peru pennsylvania 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:34.840
 tunisia and many others 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:37.840
 we certainly need to think if not 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:41.079
 about the plausibility of their existence then about 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:44.799
 tom why disappeared so much more 

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:47.220
 strong and powerful civilization than 

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:47.220
 we are with you
