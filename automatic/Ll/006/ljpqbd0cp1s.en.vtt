when<00:00:04.830> I<00:00:04.859> was<00:00:05.100> a<00:00:05.130> professor<00:00:05.790> of<00:00:06.000> acoustics<00:00:06.450> I

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
when I was a professor of acoustics I

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.280 
when I was a professor of acoustics I
was<00:00:07.710> never<00:00:07.950> fond<00:00:08.309> of<00:00:08.460> modeling<00:00:08.880> programs<00:00:09.300> and

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
was never fond of modeling programs and

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.640 
was never fond of modeling programs and
quite<00:00:10.469> frankly<00:00:10.679> when<00:00:12.019> Mike<00:00:13.019> invited<00:00:13.230> me<00:00:13.530> to

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
quite frankly when Mike invited me to

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.740 
quite frankly when Mike invited me to
join<00:00:13.679> the<00:00:14.009> Dan<00:00:14.160> Lee<00:00:14.309> family<00:00:14.730> and<00:00:14.940> one<00:00:15.540> of<00:00:15.630> my

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
join the Dan Lee family and one of my

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.310 
join the Dan Lee family and one of my
first<00:00:16.080> assignments<00:00:16.800> was<00:00:17.369> to<00:00:18.180> work<00:00:18.359> on<00:00:18.630> DDT

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
first assignments was to work on DDT

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.960 
first assignments was to work on DDT
with<00:00:19.740> the<00:00:19.830> programmer<00:00:20.310> as<00:00:20.789> like<00:00:21.060> wow<00:00:21.390> really<00:00:21.689> a

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:22.970 
with the programmer as like wow really a

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:26.779 
with the programmer as like wow really a
modeling<00:00:23.970> program<00:00:25.160> because<00:00:26.160> I<00:00:26.250> didn't<00:00:26.490> quite

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
modeling program because I didn't quite

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.320 
modeling program because I didn't quite
fully<00:00:27.150> grasp<00:00:27.900> why<00:00:28.289> a<00:00:28.680> loudspeaker<00:00:29.490> company

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
fully grasp why a loudspeaker company

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:36.080 
fully grasp why a loudspeaker company
would<00:00:31.050> what<00:00:31.260> a<00:00:31.289> modeling<00:00:31.679> program<00:00:35.090> I've

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
would what a modeling program I've

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.979 
would what a modeling program I've
actively<00:00:36.719> used<00:00:37.430> EES<00:00:38.430> since<00:00:39.000> the<00:00:39.360> dodge<00:00:39.570> days

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
actively used EES since the dodge days

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.639 
actively used EES since the dodge days
and<00:00:40.469> and<00:00:40.770> Ulysses<00:00:41.399> and<00:00:41.850> cat<00:00:42.629> acoustics<00:00:43.260> and

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
and and Ulysses and cat acoustics and

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.430 
and and Ulysses and cat acoustics and
and<00:00:43.980> I<00:00:44.309> knew<00:00:44.489> the<00:00:44.640> limitations<00:00:45.270> of<00:00:45.629> them<00:00:45.870> and

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
and I knew the limitations of them and

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.889 
and I knew the limitations of them and
one<00:00:46.649> of<00:00:46.680> them<00:00:46.920> was<00:00:47.160> at<00:00:47.850> that<00:00:48.090> time<00:00:48.149> I<00:00:48.390> couldn't

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
one of them was at that time I couldn't

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.029 
one of them was at that time I couldn't
find<00:00:49.110> anything<00:00:49.350> that<00:00:49.500> would<00:00:49.620> allow<00:00:49.860> me<00:00:50.010> to

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
find anything that would allow me to

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.340 
find anything that would allow me to
show<00:00:50.670> accurately<00:00:51.270> sub-woofer<00:00:51.629> interaction

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
show accurately sub-woofer interaction

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.250 
show accurately sub-woofer interaction
because<00:00:53.340> they<00:00:53.579> basically<00:00:54.300> stopped<00:00:54.780> at<00:00:54.960> 100

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
because they basically stopped at 100

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.160 
because they basically stopped at 100

Sebastian<00:00:58.170> who's<00:00:58.350> the<00:00:58.559> programmer<00:00:59.010> and<00:00:59.160> I

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
Sebastian who's the programmer and I

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.209 
Sebastian who's the programmer and I
began<00:00:59.699> to<00:00:59.760> realize<00:01:00.059> that<00:01:00.719> DDT<00:01:01.680> had<00:01:02.010> matured

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
began to realize that DDT had matured

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.460 
began to realize that DDT had matured
and<00:01:02.699> that<00:01:03.420> if<00:01:03.510> we<00:01:03.629> wanted<00:01:03.870> to<00:01:03.930> do<00:01:04.080> some<00:01:04.290> new

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
and that if we wanted to do some new

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:05.870 
and that if we wanted to do some new
things<00:01:04.739> we<00:01:04.920> were<00:01:05.010> gonna<00:01:05.100> have<00:01:05.339> to<00:01:05.460> start<00:01:05.700> over

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
things we were gonna have to start over

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.149 
things we were gonna have to start over
and<00:01:06.240> so<00:01:07.140> we<00:01:07.560> started<00:01:08.100> down<00:01:08.310> that<00:01:08.369> path<00:01:08.880> of

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:10.159 
and so we started down that path of

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:12.020 
and so we started down that path of
initially<00:01:11.159> creating<00:01:11.520> what<00:01:11.640> we<00:01:11.670> thought<00:01:11.909> was

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
initially creating what we thought was

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.750 
initially creating what we thought was
going<00:01:12.150> to<00:01:12.210> be<00:01:12.270> DDT<00:01:12.780> 2.0<00:01:13.439> but<00:01:14.010> we<00:01:14.130> realized<00:01:14.520> this

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
going to be DDT 2.0 but we realized this

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.240 
going to be DDT 2.0 but we realized this
is<00:01:14.939> a<00:01:14.970> completely<00:01:15.630> new<00:01:15.780> thing<00:01:15.830> this<00:01:16.830> is<00:01:17.009> a<00:01:17.040> new

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
is a completely new thing this is a new

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.289 
is a completely new thing this is a new
program<00:01:17.460> and<00:01:17.970> so<00:01:18.630> we<00:01:18.750> called<00:01:18.960> it<00:01:19.080> direct<00:01:20.299> its

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
program and so we called it direct its

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.999 
program and so we called it direct its
direct<00:01:21.810> because<00:01:23.390> it<00:01:24.390> focuses<00:01:24.930> on<00:01:25.140> what<00:01:25.890> does

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
direct because it focuses on what does

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.410 
direct because it focuses on what does
the<00:01:26.130> sound<00:01:26.340> do<00:01:26.700> when<00:01:26.939> it<00:01:27.030> leaves<00:01:27.210> the

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
the sound do when it leaves the

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.030 
the sound do when it leaves the
loudspeaker<00:01:27.990> how<00:01:28.170> does<00:01:28.320> that<00:01:28.439> interact<00:01:28.590> with

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
loudspeaker how does that interact with

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.950 
loudspeaker how does that interact with
the<00:01:29.189> the<00:01:29.549> direct<00:01:29.820> field<00:01:30.030> or<00:01:30.659> how<00:01:30.840> does

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
the the direct field or how does

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.690 
the the direct field or how does
interact<00:01:31.290> with<00:01:31.409> the<00:01:31.500> audience<00:01:31.829> we<00:01:32.369> dreamed

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
interact with the audience we dreamed

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.030 
interact with the audience we dreamed
big<00:01:33.000> say<00:01:33.689> well<00:01:33.869> what<00:01:34.140> could<00:01:34.320> we<00:01:34.470> do<00:01:34.619> what<00:01:34.920> would

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
big say well what could we do what would

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.870 
big say well what could we do what would
the<00:01:35.159> ideal<00:01:36.710> program<00:01:37.710> look<00:01:38.250> like<00:01:38.490> what<00:01:38.759> would

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
the ideal program look like what would

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.030 
the ideal program look like what would
it<00:01:38.939> have<00:01:39.210> to<00:01:39.420> do<00:01:39.600> but<00:01:40.020> needed<00:01:40.259> to<00:01:40.290> be<00:01:40.439> fast<00:01:40.740> it

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
it have to do but needed to be fast it

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.609 
it have to do but needed to be fast it
needed<00:01:41.280> to<00:01:41.310> be<00:01:41.689> adaptable<00:01:42.689> that<00:01:43.020> that<00:01:43.290> the

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
needed to be adaptable that that the

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.039 
needed to be adaptable that that the
user<00:01:43.890> could<00:01:44.250> create<00:01:44.579> his<00:01:45.060> or<00:01:45.210> her<00:01:45.360> own<00:01:45.390> sort<00:01:46.020> of

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
user could create his or her own sort of

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.990 
user could create his or her own sort of
work<00:01:46.290> environment<00:01:46.950> it<00:01:47.399> needed<00:01:47.700> to<00:01:47.790> have<00:01:47.970> a

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
work environment it needed to have a

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.960 
work environment it needed to have a
really<00:01:48.659> powerful<00:01:48.869> graphics<00:01:49.530> engine<00:01:49.860> so<00:01:50.369> the

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
really powerful graphics engine so the

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.999 
really powerful graphics engine so the
graphic<00:01:51.570> that<00:01:51.720> produced<00:01:52.020> had<00:01:52.170> to<00:01:52.259> look<00:01:52.500> really

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
graphic that produced had to look really

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:53.800 
graphic that produced had to look really
good

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810 
good

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.289 
good
it<00:01:54.140> had<00:01:54.380> to<00:01:54.500> be<00:01:54.530> accurate<00:01:55.100> it<00:01:55.549> had<00:01:55.729> to<00:01:55.850> use<00:01:56.030> good

00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:56.299 
it had to be accurate it had to use good

00:01:56.299 --> 00:01:58.780 
it had to be accurate it had to use good
data<00:01:56.600> it<00:01:57.320> had<00:01:57.560> to<00:01:57.770> we<00:01:58.280> had<00:01:58.310> to<00:01:58.430> make<00:01:58.640> sure<00:01:58.670> that

00:01:58.780 --> 00:01:58.790 
data it had to we had to make sure that

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:01.870 
data it had to we had to make sure that
the<00:01:59.030> math<00:01:59.240> was<00:01:59.479> right<00:01:59.740> when<00:02:00.740> when<00:02:01.340> Doug<00:02:01.640> and

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880 
the math was right when when Doug and

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.740 
the math was right when when Doug and
Sebastian<00:02:02.390> got<00:02:02.539> together<00:02:02.899> it<00:02:03.530> really<00:02:03.890> made

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:04.750 
Sebastian got together it really made

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:08.740 
Sebastian got together it really made
some<00:02:06.009> use<00:02:07.009> of<00:02:07.189> bad<00:02:07.310> cliche<00:02:07.520> it<00:02:08.300> made<00:02:08.539> some

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:08.750 
some use of bad cliche it made some

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:12.040 
some use of bad cliche it made some

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
and he's the guy that wrote the code

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.540 
and he's the guy that wrote the code
that<00:02:15.080> is<00:02:15.290> direct<00:02:15.680> I<00:02:15.920> can't<00:02:16.160> tell<00:02:16.340> you<00:02:16.400> how<00:02:16.489> many

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:19.550 
times I've been blown away by the code

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:21.699 
times I've been blown away by the code
that<00:02:19.730> comes<00:02:19.849> back<00:02:20.150> from<00:02:20.450> from<00:02:20.959> Chile<00:02:21.349> and<00:02:21.530> says

the fact that I can render a hundred
loudspeakers<00:02:41.120> in<00:02:41.380> seconds<00:02:42.380> and<00:02:42.560> then<00:02:43.040> take

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
loudspeakers in seconds and then take

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:45.720 
loudspeakers in seconds and then take
the<00:02:43.400> entire<00:02:43.760> 3d<00:02:44.360> model<00:02:44.720> and<00:02:44.840> rotate<00:02:45.290> it<00:02:45.500> and

the entire 3d model and rotate it and

the entire 3d model and rotate it and
everything<00:02:46.730> stays<00:02:47.030> rendered<00:02:47.540> there<00:02:48.019> is<00:02:48.170> no

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 
everything stays rendered there is no

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:50.860 
everything stays rendered there is no
