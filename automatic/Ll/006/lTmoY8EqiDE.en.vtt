00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.020
 6 is more than the car 

00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:03.570
 this is by no means 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:04.960
 record for the PC 

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:08.910
 because there were already luxury train cars but the first one will be very successful 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:09.460
 start 

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:11.729
 that if the bmw x5 go 

00:00:11.729 --> 00:00:15.279
 the turnover to the appearance of the SUV but the performance on the 

00:00:15.279 --> 00:00:18.279
 away from saying a very thickly dressed bmw 5 series 

00:00:19.079 --> 00:00:22.939
 and that became a success so much so that many other competitors 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:26.209
 with the own variation on the theme i think it is porsche yen too 

00:00:26.209 --> 00:00:27.859
 to the people about sport 

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:31.550
 and now we have arrived at generation 3 only the times are now one 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:35.019
 much harder for this fact not only are now more competitors on the 

00:00:35.019 --> 00:00:35.660
 market 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:38.260
 but the spirit of the time is no longer entirely in favor of the big one 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.280
 a sublime so how much chance does the new x 50 have 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:54.430
 if you get in then you understand the appeal of such a bmw x5 you 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:58.190
 sit nice and high you a lot of space as beautifully finished beautiful materials 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:02.240
 it's just a really nice car may be on the road 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.340
 we are looking for 

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:07.880
 anyway the front occupants and the rear seat has more than enough 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.590
 space and in the boot just lost all those ski equipment for the winter 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:15.090
 Moreover, nowadays you can also get a third row of seats, so possibly 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.090
 seven people on the road can only go to the space behind 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:22.790
 outside of these times you are not going for pleasure that you are already after austria 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:24.960
 it was only because you didn't lose anything at all 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.960
 business space 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:31.070
 because the involved spray states to minus 4 and family quite comfortable cruiser 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.640
 especially if the asphalt is just the hole as with us in the Netherlands 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:35.150
 is 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:38.070
 That is just very nice to eat miles before you know it is there again 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.420
 three hundred kilometers on the clock 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:42.800
 only yes the bmw x5 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:46.700
 hobbyhorse that has always been year 2010 but he drives is a passenger car 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:50.630
 in the third generation that has also been tried and done 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:51.990
 done them through two things 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.150
 for these four, the suspension is back in the typhus, which means that it is fairly direct 

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:59.490
 Torture and Control is the Director of the Global 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.870
 developments from the left 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:05.230
 that is actually the most flexible part of being connected 

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:07.180
 with union of the car 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:10.190
 only the controls are also very light and therefore you are looking for that 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:13.449
 control the bend in the you have to correct bit search 

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:17.649
 and when you were halfway up the bend of the road slightly wounded radermecker hit it 

00:02:17.649 --> 00:02:21.359
 stiff suspension surely that the weight thrown into the fight turns the dancers 

00:02:22.359 --> 00:02:25.729
 with this car you just do not go corners with this car you go nice and relaxed 

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:28.729
 cruiser 

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:36.649
 the ceiling of the tour that just fits the character of the 

00:02:36.649 --> 00:02:40.639
 engine are on the road with the 30,000 three-liter six-cylinder diesel two 

00:02:40.639 --> 00:02:44.579
 turbos 258 hp and 560 need meters 

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:47.369
 and that at five revolutions per minute 

00:02:47.369 --> 00:02:50.719
 paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission from zf that nowadays is a bit of every 

00:02:50.719 --> 00:02:53.869
 getting an employee is just going to experience a terrible shame 

00:02:54.429 --> 00:02:57.749
 in the party greenhouse with normal skiing you really do not exceed 2,000 rpm 

00:02:57.749 --> 00:02:58.999
 a minute 

00:02:58.999 --> 00:03:01.299
 m if you give with your skate then 

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:05.909
 nice sixty in the group of people still going their way up okay yet with fat 

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:07.709
 two tons of boat on the way but he is 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:10.709
 well not smoothly but just really seriously fast 

00:03:11.689 --> 00:03:15.529
 in addition, very refined murder never really gives me gas 

00:03:15.529 --> 00:03:18.159
 get goosebumps 

00:03:18.159 --> 00:03:19.179
 only 

00:03:19.179 --> 00:03:22.379
 He has to get the pollution from the gasoline engine but nowadays you have 

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:25.629
 also the consumption of a gasoline engine the time you bought a diesel 

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:28.629
 bit select group of people drove reasonably well yesterday 

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:35.109
 maybe and at 12,000 if it is really just outside I just stand quite 

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:35.769
 a lot of 

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:37.859
 then it really ends 

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:40.859
 so no it's not for people with a tight wallet 

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:49.419
 know your life consumption is a big expense if you wanted to turn something off 

00:03:49.419 --> 00:03:52.799
 get a melinda touch that she has to take with her in substantial pocket money 

00:03:53.529 --> 00:03:57.249
 basically anything can be self-locking systems everything actually nobody knows 

00:03:57.249 --> 00:04:00.980
 from the club to learn wide screen navigation opportunities crazy not conceive 

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:06.019
 only if you have all that on do you have foxes test specimens 100 and 

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:08.559
 12,000 euros 

00:04:08.559 --> 00:04:11.739
 yes then you might ask why is the 5 series touring 

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:14.789
 also spacious also available with a thick diesel also available with 

00:04:14.789 --> 00:04:18.209
 four-wheel drive and all kinds of advanced systems and moreover one 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:19.100
 much cheaper 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:20.549
 and thrift 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:23.720
 but yes if people would rather not have these four in the driveway 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:25.559
 that it never became something with the x5
