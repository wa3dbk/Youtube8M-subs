 on foot 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.450
 it was time 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:55.420
 the causes of this railway disaster are unknown at the moment 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:58.960
 human error signaling problem or technical failure or 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.960
 bad climatic conditions no hypothesis is excluded 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.000
 whether it is 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.660
 she hears right now our special envoy of nene at the moment 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:10.459
 from alan b 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:13.139
 secondly I ordered you are near the disaster zone 

00:02:13.139 --> 00:02:17.170
 why is it so difficult to establish an accurate balance sheet 

00:02:19.839 --> 00:02:23.969
 not sure that this is certainly there is confusion and that reigns here we have 

00:02:23.969 --> 00:02:24.410
 occurred 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:29.120
 10 the ambulance fire balloon furrowed for several kilometers 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.660
 are precisely very close to the collision zone just behind me the 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:37.420
 2nd sports center were welcomed the first wounded but to 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:40.880
 the guard alela a few kilometers from here and many more wounded are 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:44.270
 welcomed this is a little again the general confusion where we have 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:48.000
 met yet another half-hour of the wounded who were coming out of the trains and 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.320
 who told us that they had to walk several hundred meters 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:52.370
 ways to regain 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:55.049
 daley first seeming hurry for india certainly why he 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:56.969
 was the difficult while he is still standing 

00:02:56.969 --> 00:03:00.829
 to decipher the toll of this rail disaster end of the year 

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:03.829
 is there any more explanation on the reasons for this disaster 

00:03:06.559 --> 00:03:08.430
 but still no explanation 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:11.859
 The investigators will have to look at the causes of this 

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:14.590
 disaster quickly and of course it's first and foremost 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:17.239
 to the wounded what we know is that we spoke to us somewhat 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:19.459
 people who have been out of the 30 days of itt 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:22.209
 it was a press that a chain collision was first 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:23.709
 a collision between two trains 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:27.689
 8 other trains behind who came to hit another hundred and 

00:03:27.689 --> 00:03:30.289
 two trains that were on the tracks brief for 

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:33.389
 we can speak here the real mandine a chain collision and that's 

00:03:33.389 --> 00:03:37.509
 why it is still difficult to establish precisely the causes of 

00:03:37.509 --> 00:03:38.260
 this accident 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.450
 thank you for giving wearing this time and years as a result of this 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:44.490
 accident the thalys traffic made eurostar was immediately 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:45.570
