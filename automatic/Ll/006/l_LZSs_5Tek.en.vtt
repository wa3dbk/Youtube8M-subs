00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:23.770 

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:27.690 

just<00:03:24.310> a<00:03:24.430> little<00:03:24.760> bit<00:03:25.390> less<00:03:26.110> than<00:03:26.320> three<00:03:26.770> you're

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:27.700 
just a little bit less than three you're

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:31.500 
just a little bit less than three you're
like<00:03:27.820> two<00:03:27.970> and<00:03:28.120> a<00:03:28.150> half<00:03:29.610> which<00:03:30.610> is<00:03:30.760> I<00:03:31.030> mean

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:31.510 
like two and a half which is I mean

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:33.750 
like two and a half which is I mean
that's<00:03:31.720> right<00:03:31.990> it's<00:03:32.290> just<00:03:32.500> that<00:03:32.710> I<00:03:32.980> mean<00:03:33.550> since

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:33.760 
that's right it's just that I mean since

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:39.060 
that's right it's just that I mean since
he<00:03:33.880> is<00:03:34.000> smaller<00:03:34.480> than<00:03:34.920> Mordecai<00:03:35.920> but<00:03:38.070> he's

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:39.070 
he is smaller than Mordecai but he's

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:41.580 
he is smaller than Mordecai but he's
just<00:03:39.160> obviously<00:03:39.700> a<00:03:39.730> way<00:03:40.000> thicker<00:03:40.390> toy<00:03:40.810> then

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:41.590 
just obviously a way thicker toy then

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:43.380 
just obviously a way thicker toy then
Mordecai<00:03:42.100> Mordecai<00:03:42.130> is<00:03:42.640> just<00:03:42.940> a<00:03:43.120> really

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:43.390 
Mordecai Mordecai is just a really

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:46.590 
Mordecai Mordecai is just a really
really<00:03:43.870> weak<00:03:44.080> toy<00:03:44.380> and<00:03:45.250> with<00:03:45.940> people<00:03:46.270> already

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:46.600 
really weak toy and with people already

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:49.500 
really weak toy and with people already
breaking<00:03:46.870> the<00:03:47.110> legs<00:03:47.350> I<00:03:47.620> can<00:03:47.800> see<00:03:48.010> why<00:03:48.510> it's

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:49.510 
breaking the legs I can see why it's

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:52.610 
breaking the legs I can see why it's
just<00:03:49.690> really<00:03:49.960> really<00:03:50.290> thin<00:03:50.500> piece<00:03:50.740> of<00:03:50.770> plastic

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
just really really thin piece of plastic

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:59.520 
just really really thin piece of plastic
so<00:03:53.620> to<00:03:53.680> review<00:03:53.890> these<00:03:54.520> I<00:03:54.880> would<00:03:55.000> say<00:03:58.530> probably

00:03:59.520 --> 00:03:59.530 
so to review these I would say probably

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:00.390 
so to review these I would say probably
a<00:03:59.620> 5<00:03:59.860> out<00:04:00.040> of<00:04:00.070> 10

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:00.400 
a 5 out of 10

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:03.510 
a 5 out of 10
I<00:04:00.580> mean<00:04:00.730> I'm<00:04:00.850> I<00:04:01.000> didn't<00:04:01.390> open<00:04:01.540> them<00:04:01.870> but<00:04:02.520> just

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:03.520 
I mean I'm I didn't open them but just

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:07.050 
I mean I'm I didn't open them but just
by<00:04:03.670> the<00:04:03.730> look<00:04:04.000> of<00:04:04.150> them<00:04:04.300> and<00:04:04.630> I<00:04:06.060> really

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:07.060 
by the look of them and I really

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:08.820 
by the look of them and I really
should've<00:04:07.300> just<00:04:07.450> waited<00:04:07.660> to<00:04:08.260> get<00:04:08.380> these<00:04:08.500> six

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:08.830 
should've just waited to get these six

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:11.160 
should've just waited to get these six
inch<00:04:09.010> ones<00:04:09.250> so<00:04:09.640> I'll<00:04:10.330> probably<00:04:10.810> read

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:11.170 
inch ones so I'll probably read

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:15.030 
inch ones so I'll probably read
returning<00:04:11.800> these<00:04:11.890> tomorrow<00:04:12.310> but<00:04:13.740> there<00:04:14.740> we<00:04:14.860> go

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:15.040 
returning these tomorrow but there we go

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:16.650 
returning these tomorrow but there we go
I'm<00:04:15.550> probably<00:04:15.730> just<00:04:15.850> gonna<00:04:16.030> wait<00:04:16.239> for<00:04:16.270> all<00:04:16.540> the

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:16.660 
I'm probably just gonna wait for all the

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:18.240 
I'm probably just gonna wait for all the
six<00:04:16.900> inch<00:04:17.080> ones<00:04:17.260> to<00:04:17.410> come<00:04:17.560> out<00:04:17.799> instead<00:04:18.040> of

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:24.490 
ones for three dollars more each so why

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:26.100
