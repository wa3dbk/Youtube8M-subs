welcome<00:00:01.410> to<00:00:01.530> NCIX<00:00:02.010> tech<00:00:02.040> tips<00:00:02.460> today<00:00:02.639> we're

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:02.850 
welcome to NCIX tech tips today we're

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:04.940 
welcome to NCIX tech tips today we're
going<00:00:02.939> to<00:00:03.000> be<00:00:03.149> doing<00:00:03.300> okay<00:00:04.110> I<00:00:04.140> guess<00:00:04.470> kind<00:00:04.740> of<00:00:04.859> a

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:04.950 
going to be doing okay I guess kind of a

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.639 
going to be doing okay I guess kind of a
two-tiered<00:00:05.850> episode<00:00:06.509> so<00:00:06.750> this<00:00:06.930> has<00:00:07.170> a<00:00:07.200> couple

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
two-tiered episode so this has a couple

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:09.169 
two-tiered episode so this has a couple
of<00:00:07.740> different<00:00:08.069> topics<00:00:08.189> that<00:00:08.580> are<00:00:08.610> both<00:00:08.880> the

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179 
of different topics that are both the

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:11.120 
of different topics that are both the
topic<00:00:09.510> today<00:00:09.660> first<00:00:10.410> of<00:00:10.590> all<00:00:10.740> we<00:00:10.950> have<00:00:10.980> the

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
topic today first of all we have the

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.200 
topic today first of all we have the

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
on all six cores like say you're doing

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.370 
on all six cores like say you're doing
3d<00:00:29.160> rendering<00:00:29.880> or<00:00:30.179> 2d<00:00:30.689> rendering<00:00:30.869> for<00:00:31.260> that

3d rendering or 2d rendering for that

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.440 
3d rendering or 2d rendering for that
matter<00:00:31.619> or<00:00:31.949> you're<00:00:32.579> running<00:00:32.940> something<00:00:33.180> that

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
matter or you're running something that

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.299 
matter or you're running something that
really<00:00:33.719> takes<00:00:34.050> advantage<00:00:34.739> of<00:00:34.860> all<00:00:35.070> those

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
really takes advantage of all those

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:36.860 
really takes advantage of all those
course<00:00:35.670> three<00:00:36.180> point<00:00:36.420> three<00:00:36.450> gigahertz

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
course three point three gigahertz

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.810 
course three point three gigahertz
however<00:00:37.469> if<00:00:37.770> you're<00:00:38.160> running<00:00:38.280> something<00:00:38.610> like

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
however if you're running something like

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.850 
however if you're running something like
a<00:00:38.850> 3d<00:00:39.270> game<00:00:39.300> that<00:00:39.750> only<00:00:39.870> needs<00:00:40.170> three<00:00:40.469> cores<00:00:40.739> or

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
a 3d game that only needs three cores or

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.220 
a 3d game that only needs three cores or
less<00:00:41.100> that<00:00:41.640> T<00:00:41.910> at<00:00:42.000> the<00:00:42.180> end<00:00:42.300> stands<00:00:42.600> for<00:00:42.899> turbo

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
less that T at the end stands for turbo

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:44.450 
less that T at the end stands for turbo
so<00:00:43.410> that<00:00:43.530> means<00:00:43.710> it's<00:00:43.860> actually<00:00:44.219> going<00:00:44.370> to

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
so that means it's actually going to

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.360 
so that means it's actually going to
turbo<00:00:44.850> three<00:00:45.149> of<00:00:45.270> the<00:00:45.360> cores<00:00:45.570> up<00:00:45.809> to<00:00:46.370> 3.7

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
terms of graphics cards I've got them

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.589

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.559 
both running with a radeon 6870 graphics
card<00:02:12.870> so<00:02:13.050> that<00:02:13.080> we<00:02:13.319> have

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569 
card so that we have

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:15.959 
card so that we have
of<00:02:13.629> parody<00:02:14.379> between<00:02:14.709> the<00:02:14.829> platforms<00:02:15.519> when

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:15.969 
of parody between the platforms when

00:02:15.969 --> 00:02:18.750 
of parody between the platforms when
we're<00:02:16.150> running<00:02:16.450> any<00:02:16.599> 3d<00:02:16.989> benchmarks<00:02:17.739> so<00:02:17.950> the

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
we're running any 3d benchmarks so the

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.640 
we're running any 3d benchmarks so the
first<00:02:19.030> thing<00:02:19.150> I<00:02:19.359> went<00:02:19.480> with<00:02:19.719> was<00:02:19.959> vegas<00:02:20.379> pro

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
first thing I went with was vegas pro

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.640 
first thing I went with was vegas pro
now<00:02:20.920> not<00:02:21.370> every<00:02:21.969> editing<00:02:22.599> software<00:02:23.319> takes

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
now not every editing software takes

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:26.970 
now not every editing software takes
advantage<00:02:24.280> of<00:02:24.959> the<00:02:25.959> same<00:02:26.170> number<00:02:26.499> of<00:02:26.620> threads

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
advantage of the same number of threads

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.009 
advantage of the same number of threads
so<00:02:27.280> Vegas<00:02:27.639> was<00:02:27.849> an<00:02:27.939> example<00:02:28.450> that<00:02:28.480> I<00:02:28.599> found

00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:29.019 
so Vegas was an example that I found

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:32.819 
so Vegas was an example that I found
where<00:02:29.680> the<00:02:30.239> 870<00:02:31.239> actually<00:02:31.810> outperformed<00:02:32.590> the

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:32.829 
where the 870 actually outperformed the

00:02:32.829 --> 00:02:36.149 
where the 870 actually outperformed the
1100<00:02:33.519> T<00:02:33.760> so<00:02:34.269> it<00:02:34.450> was<00:02:34.599> able<00:02:34.930> to<00:02:35.079> render<00:02:35.290> this<00:02:35.590> HD

00:02:36.149 --> 00:02:36.159 
1100 T so it was able to render this HD

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:39.659 
1100 T so it was able to render this HD
video<00:02:36.489> of<00:02:36.760> my<00:02:36.939> cats<00:02:37.299> in<00:02:37.920> four<00:02:38.920> minutes<00:02:39.129> 13

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:39.669 
video of my cats in four minutes 13

00:02:39.669 --> 00:02:41.849 
video of my cats in four minutes 13
seconds<00:02:40.090> versus<00:02:40.480> five<00:02:40.719> minutes<00:02:41.049> 11<00:02:41.469> seconds

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:41.859 
seconds versus five minutes 11 seconds

00:02:41.859 --> 00:02:45.209 
seconds versus five minutes 11 seconds
on<00:02:41.980> the<00:02:42.010> 1100<00:02:42.790> T<00:02:42.999> so<00:02:43.599> that<00:02:43.810> was<00:02:44.139> the<00:02:44.620> actually

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:45.219 
on the 1100 T so that was the actually

00:02:45.219 --> 00:02:47.129 
on the 1100 T so that was the actually
only<00:02:45.489> the<00:02:45.819> yeah<00:02:46.480> that<00:02:46.689> was<00:02:46.840> the<00:02:46.870> only

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:47.139 
only the yeah that was the only

00:02:47.139 --> 00:02:48.899 
only the yeah that was the only
benchmark<00:02:47.829> other<00:02:48.010> than<00:02:48.219> Windows<00:02:48.489> Live<00:02:48.669> Movie

00:02:48.899 --> 00:02:48.909 
benchmark other than Windows Live Movie

00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:51.659 
benchmark other than Windows Live Movie
Maker<00:02:49.060> where<00:02:49.810> the<00:02:49.959> 870<00:02:50.590> actually<00:02:51.159> beat<00:02:51.459> the

00:02:51.659 --> 00:02:51.669 
Maker where the 870 actually beat the

00:02:51.669 --> 00:02:55.709 
Maker where the 870 actually beat the
fenham<00:02:52.260> 2x6<00:02:53.730> the<00:02:54.730> next<00:02:55.000> benchmark<00:02:55.419> we<00:02:55.540> had<00:02:55.689> a

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:55.719 
fenham 2x6 the next benchmark we had a

00:02:55.719 --> 00:02:58.110 
fenham 2x6 the next benchmark we had a
look<00:02:55.959> at<00:02:56.139> is<00:02:56.290> the<00:02:56.439> ever-popular<00:02:56.919> cinebench<00:02:57.790> so

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
look at is the ever-popular cinebench so

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.080 
look at is the ever-popular cinebench so
this<00:02:58.269> is<00:02:58.419> a<00:02:58.449> rendering<00:02:59.189> benchmark<00:03:00.189> and<00:03:00.370> in

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.090 
this is a rendering benchmark and in

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:04.500 
this is a rendering benchmark and in
this<00:03:01.269> particular<00:03:01.650> application<00:03:02.650> the<00:03:03.040> true<00:03:03.969> six

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.510 
this particular application the true six

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:07.619 
this particular application the true six
core<00:03:04.840> design<00:03:05.230> of<00:03:05.439> the<00:03:05.560> 1100<00:03:06.250> T<00:03:06.459> was<00:03:07.120> actually

00:03:07.619 --> 00:03:07.629 
core design of the 1100 T was actually

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:10.289 
core design of the 1100 T was actually
slightly<00:03:07.959> more<00:03:08.349> powerful<00:03:08.949> than<00:03:09.370> the<00:03:09.609> fork<00:03:10.000> or

00:03:10.289 --> 00:03:10.299 
slightly more powerful than the fork or

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:14.939 
slightly more powerful than the fork or
a<00:03:10.540> thread<00:03:10.989> design<00:03:11.409> of<00:03:11.680> the<00:03:12.010> i7<00:03:12.879> 870<00:03:13.750> so<00:03:14.379> we<00:03:14.769> were

00:03:14.939 --> 00:03:14.949 
a thread design of the i7 870 so we were

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:16.649 
a thread design of the i7 870 so we were
able<00:03:15.069> to<00:03:15.370> get<00:03:15.459> a<00:03:15.519> score<00:03:15.819> of<00:03:15.939> five<00:03:16.150> point<00:03:16.449> eight

00:03:16.649 --> 00:03:16.659 
able to get a score of five point eight

00:03:16.659 --> 00:03:20.429 
able to get a score of five point eight
eight<00:03:16.840> points<00:03:17.290> with<00:03:17.439> the<00:03:17.560> 1100<00:03:18.159> T<00:03:18.549> and<00:03:19.439> 5.4

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:47.680 
would give the edge to the 1100 T so in

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:50.280 
would give the edge to the 1100 T so in

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:08.140 
give you guys a general conclusion about

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:10.770 
give you guys a general conclusion about
the<00:05:08.260> AMD<00:05:08.710> vision<00:05:09.010> black<00:05:09.160> platform<00:05:09.460> so<00:05:09.970> as<00:05:10.180> you

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:10.780 
the AMD vision black platform so as you

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:12.900 
the AMD vision black platform so as you
can<00:05:10.930> see<00:05:11.200> on<00:05:11.440> AMD<00:05:12.010> site<00:05:12.280> the<00:05:12.490> reason<00:05:12.790> they

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:12.910 
can see on AMD site the reason they

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:16.260 
can see on AMD site the reason they
develop<00:05:13.390> their<00:05:13.540> vision<00:05:14.050> series<00:05:14.740> of<00:05:15.040> tears<00:05:15.880> is

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:16.270 
develop their vision series of tears is

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:18.900 
develop their vision series of tears is
that<00:05:17.050> they<00:05:17.260> want<00:05:17.440> to<00:05:17.680> really<00:05:17.860> separate<00:05:18.430> which

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:18.910 
that they want to really separate which

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:20.820 
that they want to really separate which
hardware<00:05:19.360> goes<00:05:19.540> with<00:05:19.720> which<00:05:19.930> so<00:05:20.410> this<00:05:20.560> really

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:20.830 
hardware goes with which so this really

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:22.410 
hardware goes with which so this really
goes<00:05:20.950> back<00:05:21.160> to<00:05:21.340> one<00:05:21.460> of<00:05:21.550> the<00:05:21.640> episodes<00:05:21.760> we<00:05:22.270> did

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:22.420 
goes back to one of the episodes we did

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:24.840 
goes back to one of the episodes we did
recently<00:05:22.710> about<00:05:23.710> hardware<00:05:24.280> bottlenecking

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:24.850 
recently about hardware bottlenecking

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:27.600 
recently about hardware bottlenecking
and<00:05:25.150> how<00:05:25.360> to<00:05:25.420> design<00:05:25.660> a<00:05:25.840> pc<00:05:26.410> that<00:05:26.650> goes<00:05:27.250> well

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:27.610 
and how to design a pc that goes well

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:30.630 
and how to design a pc that goes well
with<00:05:28.110> itself<00:05:29.110> so<00:05:29.530> all<00:05:29.740> the<00:05:29.980> parts<00:05:30.280> are<00:05:30.400> really

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:30.640 
with itself so all the parts are really

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:32.520 
with itself so all the parts are really
well<00:05:30.790> matched<00:05:31.090> so<00:05:31.630> this<00:05:31.810> is<00:05:31.930> a<00:05:31.960> vision<00:05:32.290> black

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:32.530 
well matched so this is a vision black

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:34.110 
well matched so this is a vision black
which<00:05:32.830> means<00:05:33.070> we've<00:05:33.220> gone<00:05:33.430> with<00:05:33.730> the<00:05:33.940> highest

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:34.120 
which means we've gone with the highest

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:36.060 
which means we've gone with the highest
end<00:05:34.419> GPU<00:05:34.900> we've<00:05:35.140> gone<00:05:35.320> with<00:05:35.470> the<00:05:35.590> highest<00:05:35.770> in

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:36.070 
end GPU we've gone with the highest in

end GPU we've gone with the highest in
CPU<00:05:36.580> and<00:05:36.790> then<00:05:37.210> we've<00:05:37.360> gone<00:05:37.570> with<00:05:37.720> a<00:05:37.750> premium

motherboard<00:05:38.680> for<00:05:38.919> it<00:05:39.040> so<00:05:39.460> if<00:05:39.640> you<00:05:39.790> follow

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:40.060 
motherboard for it so if you follow

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:41.670 
motherboard for it so if you follow
those<00:05:40.300> guidelines<00:05:40.570> you<00:05:41.050> end<00:05:41.200> up<00:05:41.320> with<00:05:41.470> a<00:05:41.500> well

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:41.680 
those guidelines you end up with a well

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:43.680 
those guidelines you end up with a well
balanced<00:05:42.010> system<00:05:42.190> so<00:05:42.490> vision<00:05:42.790> black<00:05:43.270> is<00:05:43.510> all

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:43.690 
balanced system so vision black is all

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:47.130 
balanced system so vision black is all
about<00:05:43.990> rendering<00:05:44.760> okay<00:05:45.760> you've<00:05:46.450> got<00:05:46.690> video

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:47.140 
about rendering okay you've got video

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:48.690 
about rendering okay you've got video
encoding<00:05:47.590> it<00:05:47.890> can<00:05:48.040> do<00:05:48.130> all<00:05:48.310> of<00:05:48.340> that<00:05:48.430> good

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:48.700 
encoding it can do all of that good

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:50.730

stuff 3d gaming that is what it is
designed<00:05:51.190> for<00:05:51.340> so<00:05:51.669> if<00:05:51.760> you<00:05:51.850> don't<00:05:52.090> have<00:05:52.300> such

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:52.510

00:05:58.650 --> 00:05:58.660 
what you want to do so check out the AMD

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:00.480 
what you want to do so check out the AMD
website<00:05:59.080> if<00:05:59.260> you<00:05:59.560> want<00:05:59.740> some<00:05:59.860> more<00:05:59.890> details<00:06:00.280> on

website if you want some more details on
that<00:06:00.550> so<00:06:01.240> in<00:06:01.540> terms<00:06:02.080> of<00:06:02.260> comparing<00:06:02.650> our<00:06:02.860> two

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:03.040 
that so in terms of comparing our two

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:04.560 
that so in terms of comparing our two
platforms<00:06:03.280> today<00:06:03.880> they're<00:06:04.060> priced<00:06:04.330> fairly

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:04.570 
platforms today they're priced fairly

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:06.750 
platforms today they're priced fairly
similarly<00:06:05.169> although<00:06:05.350> AMD<00:06:05.919> motherboards<00:06:06.430> do

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:06.760 
similarly although AMD motherboards do

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:08.190 
similarly although AMD motherboards do
usually<00:06:06.970> end<00:06:07.360> up<00:06:07.480> a<00:06:07.660> little<00:06:07.900> bit<00:06:08.020> less

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:08.200 
usually end up a little bit less

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:10.020 
usually end up a little bit less
expensive<00:06:08.770> than<00:06:08.800> their<00:06:09.070> Intel<00:06:09.370> counterparts

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:10.030 
expensive than their Intel counterparts

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:12.270 
expensive than their Intel counterparts
for<00:06:10.419> similar<00:06:10.750> feature<00:06:10.990> sets<00:06:11.350> they<00:06:11.830> both<00:06:12.040> use

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:12.280 
for similar feature sets they both use

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:14.370 
for similar feature sets they both use
dual-channel<00:06:12.760> ddr3<00:06:13.300> RAM<00:06:13.690> so<00:06:13.990> there's<00:06:14.200> no

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:14.380 
dual-channel ddr3 RAM so there's no

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:16.920 
dual-channel ddr3 RAM so there's no
advantage<00:06:15.160> one<00:06:15.850> way<00:06:16.030> or<00:06:16.150> the<00:06:16.180> other<00:06:16.300> there<00:06:16.690> and

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:16.930 
advantage one way or the other there and

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:19.290 
advantage one way or the other there and
these<00:06:17.110> CPUs<00:06:17.680> actually<00:06:18.160> cost<00:06:18.430> very<00:06:19.120> very

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:19.300 
these CPUs actually cost very very

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:21.330 
these CPUs actually cost very very
similar<00:06:19.630> so<00:06:19.780> the<00:06:20.200> one<00:06:20.350> advantage<00:06:20.500> you<00:06:20.950> do<00:06:21.100> get

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:21.340 
similar so the one advantage you do get

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:26.580 
similar so the one advantage you do get
is<00:06:21.550> that<00:06:21.690> unlike<00:06:22.690> the<00:06:22.720> 875<00:06:23.470> k<00:06:24.190> the<00:06:24.960> 870<00:06:25.960> is<00:06:26.169> not

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:26.590 
is that unlike the 875 k the 870 is not

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:28.350 
is that unlike the 875 k the 870 is not
unlocked<00:06:27.280> which<00:06:27.550> means<00:06:27.790> it's<00:06:28.000> a<00:06:28.060> little<00:06:28.270> bit

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:28.360 
unlocked which means it's a little bit

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:30.779 
unlocked which means it's a little bit
more<00:06:28.480> difficult<00:06:28.960> to<00:06:28.990> overclock<00:06:29.530> the<00:06:30.010> 1100<00:06:30.640> T

00:06:30.779 --> 00:06:30.789 
more difficult to overclock the 1100 T

00:06:30.789 --> 00:06:32.490 
more difficult to overclock the 1100 T
is<00:06:31.000> unlocked<00:06:31.539> so<00:06:31.780> that<00:06:31.930> means<00:06:32.110> all<00:06:32.260> you<00:06:32.380> have

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:32.500 
is unlocked so that means all you have

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:34.380 
is unlocked so that means all you have
to<00:06:32.650> do<00:06:32.740> is<00:06:32.860> adjust<00:06:32.979> the<00:06:33.250> multiplier<00:06:33.729> you<00:06:34.210> can

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:34.390 
to do is adjust the multiplier you can

00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:35.570 
to do is adjust the multiplier you can
squeeze<00:06:34.660> a<00:06:34.690> little<00:06:34.900> bit<00:06:35.110> of<00:06:35.200> extra

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:35.580 
squeeze a little bit of extra

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:37.809 
squeeze a little bit of extra
performance<00:06:35.970> out<00:06:36.120> of<00:06:36.150> it<00:06:36.300> that<00:06:36.360> way<00:06:36.720> and

00:06:37.809 --> 00:06:37.819 
performance out of it that way and

00:06:37.819 --> 00:06:39.950 
performance out of it that way and
actually<00:06:38.819> that<00:06:39.120> was<00:06:39.270> all<00:06:39.419> the<00:06:39.509> notes<00:06:39.659> I<00:06:39.810> had

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:39.960 
actually that was all the notes I had

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:41.330 
actually that was all the notes I had
