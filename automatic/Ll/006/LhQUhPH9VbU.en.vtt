the<00:00:05.520> support<00:00:05.879> of<00:00:06.060> custom<00:00:06.509> normals<00:00:06.930> in<00:00:07.140> blender

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:07.589 
the support of custom normals in blender

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:09.709 
the support of custom normals in blender
has<00:00:07.770> been<00:00:08.250> requested<00:00:08.849> since<00:00:09.179> a<00:00:09.360> very<00:00:09.389> long

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
has been requested since a very long

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:12.799 
has been requested since a very long
time<00:00:10.320> if<00:00:10.679> you<00:00:11.280> do<00:00:11.460> not<00:00:11.610> know<00:00:11.910> why<00:00:11.940> this<00:00:12.240> is<00:00:12.450> so

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
time if you do not know why this is so

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.289 
time if you do not know why this is so
important<00:00:13.530> here<00:00:13.980> is<00:00:14.009> a<00:00:14.160> very<00:00:14.460> apparent<00:00:14.849> use

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
important here is a very apparent use

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.380 
important here is a very apparent use
case<00:00:15.949> whenever<00:00:16.949> you<00:00:17.220> create<00:00:17.369> a<00:00:17.699> new<00:00:17.730> August

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
case whenever you create a new August

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.150 
case whenever you create a new August
our<00:00:18.600> character<00:00:19.140> then<00:00:19.650> you<00:00:19.800> will<00:00:19.949> see

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
our character then you will see

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.220 
our character then you will see
noticeable<00:00:20.670> seems<00:00:21.119> around<00:00:21.570> the<00:00:21.750> belly<00:00:21.990> and

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
noticeable seems around the belly and

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.099 
noticeable seems around the belly and
around<00:00:22.710> the<00:00:22.920> neck<00:00:23.100> these<00:00:24.090> seams<00:00:24.539> are<00:00:24.840> caused

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
around the neck these seams are caused

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.589 
around the neck these seams are caused
by<00:00:25.380> the<00:00:25.439> fact<00:00:25.710> that<00:00:25.890> the<00:00:26.039> Avatar<00:00:26.640> head<00:00:26.939> and<00:00:27.180> its

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
by the fact that the Avatar head and its

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.320 
by the fact that the Avatar head and its
upper<00:00:27.960> body<00:00:28.170> are<00:00:28.529> two<00:00:29.010> separate<00:00:29.460> objects<00:00:30.090> and

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
upper body are two separate objects and

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.350 
upper body are two separate objects and
by<00:00:31.260> default<00:00:31.470> the<00:00:31.890> vertex<00:00:32.309> normals<00:00:32.430> along<00:00:33.180> the

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
by default the vertex normals along the

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.680 
by default the vertex normals along the
object<00:00:33.840> boundaries<00:00:34.380> do<00:00:34.620> not<00:00:34.829> match<00:00:35.690> because

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
object boundaries do not match because

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.840 
object boundaries do not match because
of<00:00:36.809> this<00:00:36.989> the<00:00:37.410> light<00:00:37.620> intensity<00:00:38.250> along<00:00:38.670> the

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
of this the light intensity along the

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.049 
of this the light intensity along the
object<00:00:39.329> boundaries<00:00:39.899> varies<00:00:40.379> and<00:00:40.680> hence<00:00:41.460> we

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
object boundaries varies and hence we

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:48.319 
object boundaries varies and hence we
see<00:00:42.090> seems<00:00:45.890> this<00:00:46.890> issue<00:00:47.250> can<00:00:47.610> be<00:00:47.640> fixed<00:00:47.789> by

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
see seems this issue can be fixed by

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.350 
see seems this issue can be fixed by
welding<00:00:48.600> the<00:00:48.930> seams<00:00:49.200> that<00:00:49.590> is<00:00:50.100> by<00:00:50.610> taking<00:00:50.789> care

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
welding the seams that is by taking care

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.900 
welding the seams that is by taking care
that<00:00:51.390> the<00:00:51.719> vertex<00:00:52.140> normals<00:00:52.260> of<00:00:52.949> both<00:00:53.250> objects

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
that the vertex normals of both objects

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.189 
that the vertex normals of both objects
match<00:00:54.180> along<00:00:54.690> the<00:00:54.899> object<00:00:55.410> boundaries<00:00:56.180> well

00:00:57.189 --> 00:00:57.199 
match along the object boundaries well

00:00:57.199 --> 00:00:59.660 
match along the object boundaries well
avistar<00:00:58.199> provides<00:00:58.649> a<00:00:58.890> normal<00:00:59.219> welding

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
avistar provides a normal welding

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.779 
avistar provides a normal welding
feature<00:00:59.940> since<00:01:00.390> a<00:01:00.570> long<00:01:00.750> time<00:01:01.010> however<00:01:02.010> this

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
feature since a long time however this

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.179 
feature since a long time however this
only<00:01:03.059> works<00:01:03.539> when<00:01:03.840> exporting<00:01:04.530> objects<00:01:05.040> to

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
only works when exporting objects to

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.120 
only works when exporting objects to
colada<00:01:05.630> but<00:01:06.630> until<00:01:06.990> now<00:01:07.020> we<00:01:07.260> have<00:01:07.619> never<00:01:07.830> been

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
colada but until now we have never been

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.039 
colada but until now we have never been
able<00:01:08.159> to<00:01:08.549> see<00:01:08.850> the<00:01:09.000> welded<00:01:09.390> normals<00:01:09.869> in

able to see the welded normals in

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:14.899 
able to see the welded normals in
blender<00:01:10.610> so<00:01:11.610> since<00:01:12.360> release<00:01:13.100> 2.74<00:01:14.100> blender

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
blender so since release 2.74 blender

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.240 
blender so since release 2.74 blender
supports<00:01:15.420> custom<00:01:15.720> normals<00:01:16.409> and<00:01:16.680> we<00:01:17.040> have

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
supports custom normals and we have

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.880
