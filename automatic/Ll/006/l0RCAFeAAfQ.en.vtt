we've<00:00:03.449> actually<00:00:03.750> got<00:00:04.230> an<00:00:04.350> Aston<00:00:04.589> Martin<00:00:05.400> in

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:05.580 
we've actually got an Aston Martin in

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.179 
we've actually got an Aston Martin in
our<00:00:06.060> workshop<00:00:06.750> and<00:00:06.960> when<00:00:07.410> you<00:00:07.500> think<00:00:07.740> back<00:00:07.799> in

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
our workshop and when you think back in

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:09.890 
our workshop and when you think back in
the<00:00:08.250> day<00:00:08.400> when<00:00:08.580> it<00:00:08.610> was<00:00:08.760> new<00:00:08.910> this<00:00:09.090> db7<00:00:09.690> would

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
the day when it was new this db7 would

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.650 
the day when it was new this db7 would
have<00:00:09.990> been<00:00:10.110> over<00:00:10.639> 70,000<00:00:11.639> pounds<00:00:11.849> the<00:00:12.450> fact

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
have been over 70,000 pounds the fact

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.180 
have been over 70,000 pounds the fact
that<00:00:12.780> my<00:00:12.900> got<00:00:13.080> it<00:00:13.170> for<00:00:13.290> 12<00:00:13.500> and<00:00:13.620> a<00:00:13.650> half<00:00:13.679> grand

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
that my got it for 12 and a half grand

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.650 
that my got it for 12 and a half grand
is<00:00:14.460> absolutely<00:00:15.240> incredible<00:00:16.850> however<00:00:17.850> since

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
is absolutely incredible however since

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.060 
is absolutely incredible however since
the<00:00:18.840> car<00:00:19.020> has<00:00:19.140> been<00:00:19.170> in<00:00:19.320> the<00:00:19.470> workshop<00:00:19.650> I've

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
the car has been in the workshop I've

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.400 
the car has been in the workshop I've
noticed<00:00:20.580> a<00:00:20.699> bit<00:00:20.850> of<00:00:20.939> oil<00:00:21.180> on<00:00:21.359> the<00:00:21.510> floor<00:00:21.630> so<00:00:22.380> my

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
noticed a bit of oil on the floor so my

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:23.990 
noticed a bit of oil on the floor so my
first<00:00:22.710> job<00:00:22.890> is<00:00:23.130> to<00:00:23.250> find<00:00:23.400> out<00:00:23.519> where<00:00:23.760> it's

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
first job is to find out where it's

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.580 
first job is to find out where it's
coming<00:00:24.060> from<00:00:24.330> and<00:00:24.720> the<00:00:24.869> best<00:00:25.109> place<00:00:25.320> to<00:00:25.350> do

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
coming from and the best place to do

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.839 
coming from and the best place to do
that<00:00:25.619> is<00:00:25.949> from<00:00:26.220> underneath<00:00:28.640> now<00:00:29.640> the<00:00:29.699> only

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
that is from underneath now the only

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.880 
that is from underneath now the only
sign<00:00:30.179> of<00:00:30.210> any<00:00:30.449> oil<00:00:30.660> leaking<00:00:31.230> seems<00:00:31.590> to<00:00:31.679> be<00:00:31.800> in

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
sign of any oil leaking seems to be in

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.500 
sign of any oil leaking seems to be in
this<00:00:32.070> area<00:00:32.489> it<00:00:32.610> looks<00:00:32.640> like<00:00:32.790> it's<00:00:33.000> coming<00:00:33.210> from

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
this area it looks like it's coming from

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.630 
this area it looks like it's coming from
this<00:00:33.989> pipe<00:00:34.320> here<00:00:34.649> it<00:00:34.829> looks<00:00:35.160> like<00:00:35.370> it's<00:00:35.520> gonna

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
this pipe here it looks like it's gonna

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.250 
this pipe here it looks like it's gonna
be<00:00:35.790> connected<00:00:35.969> to<00:00:36.360> the<00:00:36.480> oil<00:00:36.660> cooler

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
be connected to the oil cooler

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.810 
be connected to the oil cooler
you<00:00:37.440> got<00:00:37.590> like<00:00:37.680> a<00:00:37.739> rubber<00:00:38.010> hose<00:00:38.280> going<00:00:38.610> onto<00:00:38.730> a

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
you got like a rubber hose going onto a

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.729 
you got like a rubber hose going onto a
steel<00:00:39.180> pipe<00:00:39.480> and<00:00:39.750> they're<00:00:39.840> crimped<00:00:40.320> together

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
steel pipe and they're crimped together

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.229 
steel pipe and they're crimped together
and<00:00:41.100> obviously<00:00:41.190> over<00:00:41.399> time<00:00:41.670> and<00:00:42.000> it's<00:00:42.090> been

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
and obviously over time and it's been

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.690 
and obviously over time and it's been
nearly<00:00:42.510> 20<00:00:43.020> years<00:00:43.160> that<00:00:44.160> rubber<00:00:44.399> may<00:00:44.579> have

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
nearly 20 years that rubber may have

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.190 
nearly 20 years that rubber may have
perished<00:00:45.120> it's<00:00:45.270> been<00:00:45.420> shaken<00:00:45.750> around<00:00:45.870> perhaps

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
perished it's been shaken around perhaps

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.840 
perished it's been shaken around perhaps
but<00:00:46.379> it's<00:00:46.500> now<00:00:46.649> leaking<00:00:47.190> though<00:00:47.579> it's<00:00:47.730> not

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
but it's now leaking though it's not

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.459 
but it's now leaking though it's not
that<00:00:48.120> serious<00:00:48.480> at<00:00:48.899> the<00:00:48.989> moment<00:00:49.289> if<00:00:49.379> you

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
that serious at the moment if you

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:50.779 
that serious at the moment if you
imagine<00:00:49.620> that<00:00:49.800> was<00:00:49.950> to<00:00:50.070> get<00:00:50.190> much<00:00:50.370> worse<00:00:50.610> and

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
imagine that was to get much worse and

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.880 
imagine that was to get much worse and
actually<00:00:51.030> blow<00:00:51.300> off<00:00:51.570> altogether<00:00:52.199> and<00:00:52.620> all<00:00:52.770> of

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
actually blow off altogether and all of

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.110 
actually blow off altogether and all of
your<00:00:53.010> engine<00:00:53.280> oil<00:00:53.370> which<00:00:53.520> of<00:00:53.640> course<00:00:53.670> is<00:00:53.879> under

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
your engine oil which of course is under

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.490 
your engine oil which of course is under
pressure<00:00:54.270> at<00:00:54.480> this<00:00:54.570> point<00:00:54.780> but<00:00:55.199> actually<00:00:55.260> that

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
pressure at this point but actually that

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.380 
pressure at this point but actually that
leave<00:00:56.070> the<00:00:56.399> engine<00:00:56.730> you<00:00:57.059> could<00:00:57.149> end<00:00:57.300> up

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
leave the engine you could end up

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.180 
leave the engine you could end up
seizing<00:00:57.870> it<00:00:57.989> or<00:00:58.199> just<00:00:58.410> blowing<00:00:58.770> it<00:00:58.859> out<00:00:58.980> I'm

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
seizing it or just blowing it out I'm

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.760 
seizing it or just blowing it out I'm
gonna<00:00:59.340> have<00:00:59.579> to<00:00:59.760> change<00:01:00.030> it<00:01:00.649> changing<00:01:01.649> the<00:01:01.680> oil

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
gonna have to change it changing the oil

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.830 
gonna have to change it changing the oil
pipes<00:01:02.250> that<00:01:02.460> feed<00:01:02.699> the<00:01:02.879> oil<00:01:03.059> cooler<00:01:03.329> starts

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
pipes that feed the oil cooler starts

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.479 
pipes that feed the oil cooler starts
with<00:01:04.019> draining<00:01:04.470> all<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:04.979> oil<00:01:05.159> from<00:01:05.430> the

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
with draining all the oil from the

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.230 
with draining all the oil from the
system<00:01:05.909> so<00:01:06.510> out<00:01:06.689> comes<00:01:06.720> the<00:01:07.229> Sun<00:01:07.439> plug<00:01:08.060> the<00:01:09.060> oil

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
system so out comes the Sun plug the oil

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.060 
system so out comes the Sun plug the oil
catcher<00:01:09.600> keeps<00:01:09.930> the<00:01:10.080> floor<00:01:10.290> clean<00:01:10.619> and<00:01:10.860> makes

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
catcher keeps the floor clean and makes

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.590 
catcher keeps the floor clean and makes
it<00:01:11.220> easy<00:01:11.520> to<00:01:11.640> dispose<00:01:12.119> of<00:01:12.150> the<00:01:12.420> oil

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
it easy to dispose of the oil

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.590 
it easy to dispose of the oil
responsibly<00:01:13.520> then<00:01:14.520> the<00:01:14.790> Sun<00:01:15.000> plug<00:01:15.180> goes<00:01:15.330> back

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
responsibly then the Sun plug goes back

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.120 
responsibly then the Sun plug goes back
in<00:01:15.810> and<00:01:16.020> it's<00:01:16.140> time<00:01:16.320> to<00:01:16.470> disconnect<00:01:16.710> the<00:01:16.950> oil

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
in and it's time to disconnect the oil

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.469 
in and it's time to disconnect the oil
pipes<00:01:17.490> which<00:01:17.640> are<00:01:17.759> underneath<00:01:18.270> the<00:01:18.450> oil

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
pipes which are underneath the oil

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.719 
pipes which are underneath the oil
cooler<00:01:18.990> typically<00:01:19.650> there's<00:01:19.950> loads<00:01:20.310> of<00:01:20.549> stuff

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.550 
in the way the front under tray and
bracing<00:01:23.909> comes<00:01:24.180> away<00:01:24.390> easily<00:01:24.659> enough<00:01:25.110> but

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
bracing comes away easily enough but

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.080 
bracing comes away easily enough but
behind<00:01:25.830> that<00:01:26.100> there<00:01:26.340> is<00:01:26.430> a<00:01:26.460> power<00:01:26.729> steering

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
behind that there is a power steering

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.609

they're<00:01:42.329> realized<00:01:42.630> a<00:01:42.720> bit<00:01:42.810> of<00:01:42.899> a<00:01:42.990> problem<00:01:43.290> you

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
they're realized a bit of a problem you

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.289 
they're realized a bit of a problem you
get<00:01:43.470> this<00:01:43.590> galvanic<00:01:44.159> corrosion<00:01:44.640> because<00:01:45.210> of

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
get this galvanic corrosion because of

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.510 
get this galvanic corrosion because of
the<00:01:45.360> two<00:01:45.540> dissimilar<00:01:45.869> metals<00:01:46.320> and<00:01:47.100> ultimately

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
the two dissimilar metals and ultimately

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.069 
the two dissimilar metals and ultimately
what<00:01:47.670> that<00:01:47.790> means<00:01:48.000> is<00:01:48.240> is<00:01:48.600> you<00:01:48.750> can't<00:01:48.960> actually

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
what that means is is you can't actually

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.319 
what that means is is you can't actually
get<00:01:49.350> them<00:01:49.500> apart<00:01:49.799> very<00:01:49.950> easily<00:01:50.159> but<00:01:50.610> we<00:01:51.240> of

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
get them apart very easily but we of

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:52.700 
get them apart very easily but we of
course<00:01:51.509> we're<00:01:51.630> going<00:01:51.720> to<00:01:51.780> change<00:01:52.170> both

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
course we're going to change both

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.800 
course we're going to change both
hydraulic<00:01:53.430> pipes<00:01:53.700> so<00:01:54.299> I<00:01:54.329> can<00:01:54.630> actually

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
hydraulic pipes so I can actually

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.170 
hydraulic pipes so I can actually
sacrifice<00:01:55.560> these<00:01:55.920> to<00:01:56.460> make<00:01:56.579> it<00:01:56.700> easier<00:01:57.030> to

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
sacrifice these to make it easier to

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.880 
sacrifice these to make it easier to
disconnect<00:01:57.630> that<00:01:57.810> on<00:01:57.990> the<00:01:58.200> bench<00:01:58.469> and

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
disconnect that on the bench and

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.709 
disconnect that on the bench and
therefore<00:01:59.310> hopefully<00:01:59.520> we<00:01:59.790> avoid<00:02:00.060> the<00:02:00.240> risk<00:02:00.479> of

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
therefore hopefully we avoid the risk of

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:03.700 
therefore hopefully we avoid the risk of
actually<00:02:01.140> damaging<00:02:01.649> the<00:02:01.979> oil<00:02:02.130> cooler<00:02:02.460> as<00:02:02.700> well

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:03.710 
actually damaging the oil cooler as well

of our new hydraulic pipes and you can

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:37.080 
of our new hydraulic pipes and you can
see<00:02:36.040> they've<00:02:36.189> now<00:02:36.310> changed<00:02:36.849> this<00:02:36.909> to

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
see they've now changed this to

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:38.580 
see they've now changed this to
aluminium<00:02:37.720> so<00:02:37.840> when<00:02:37.959> it's<00:02:38.079> attached<00:02:38.349> to<00:02:38.470> the

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
aluminium so when it's attached to the

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:40.349 
aluminium so when it's attached to the
old<00:02:38.769> colour<00:02:39.099> there'll<00:02:39.489> be<00:02:39.519> similar<00:02:40.030> metals

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:40.359 
old colour there'll be similar metals

00:02:40.359 --> 00:02:42.869 
old colour there'll be similar metals
and<00:02:40.510> won't<00:02:40.720> corrode<00:02:41.140> what'll<00:02:41.980> I<00:02:42.040> do<00:02:42.099> now<00:02:42.189> is

00:02:42.869 --> 00:02:42.879 
and won't corrode what'll I do now is

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:44.699 
and won't corrode what'll I do now is
somehow<00:02:43.120> thread<00:02:43.510> it<00:02:43.599> through<00:02:43.750> this<00:02:43.989> tiny<00:02:44.379> tiny
