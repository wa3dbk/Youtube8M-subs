then go out into the water there to
bathe<00:03:44.560> and<00:03:44.859> then<00:03:45.459> I<00:03:45.549> had<00:03:45.700> a<00:03:45.730> hammock<00:03:46.209> set<00:03:46.510> up

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:46.660 
bathe and then I had a hammock set up

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:52.199 
bathe and then I had a hammock set up
over<00:03:46.810> here<00:03:48.600> so<00:03:49.600> that<00:03:50.170> pretty<00:03:50.410> much<00:03:51.209> sums

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:52.209 
over here so that pretty much sums

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:54.060 
over here so that pretty much sums
things<00:03:52.420> up<00:03:52.630> the<00:03:53.440> only<00:03:53.590> thing<00:03:53.769> is<00:03:53.890> that<00:03:54.040> I

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:54.070 
things up the only thing is that I

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:56.880 
things up the only thing is that I
didn't<00:03:54.430> end<00:03:54.519> up<00:03:54.670> ultimately<00:03:55.620> saving<00:03:56.620> up<00:03:56.799> a

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:56.890 
didn't end up ultimately saving up a

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:58.199 
didn't end up ultimately saving up a
bunch<00:03:57.070> of<00:03:57.160> money<00:03:57.340> because<00:03:57.640> I<00:03:57.820> didn't<00:03:58.120> get

00:03:58.199 --> 00:03:58.209 
bunch of money because I didn't get

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:00.150 
bunch of money because I didn't get
enough<00:03:58.359> work<00:03:58.570> in<00:03:58.780> because<00:03:58.930> it<00:03:59.170> was<00:03:59.260> rainy<00:03:59.560> my

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:00.160 
enough work in because it was rainy my

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.220 
enough work in because it was rainy my
my<00:04:00.519> landscaping<00:04:01.060> jobs<00:04:01.329> were<00:04:01.600> outside<00:04:02.049> of

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:02.230 
my landscaping jobs were outside of

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:05.130 
my landscaping jobs were outside of
course<00:04:02.440> and<00:04:02.709> so<00:04:03.670> things<00:04:03.910> didn't<00:04:04.150> really<00:04:04.359> work

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:05.140 
course and so things didn't really work

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:08.400 
course and so things didn't really work
out<00:04:05.290> as<00:04:05.560> I<00:04:05.769> had<00:04:05.799> hoped<00:04:06.700> but<00:04:07.359> it<00:04:08.019> was<00:04:08.170> still<00:04:08.380> a

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:08.410 
out as I had hoped but it was still a

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:10.710 
out as I had hoped but it was still a
awesome<00:04:08.920> experience<00:04:09.400> I<00:04:09.670> ended<00:04:10.390> up<00:04:10.450> leaving

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:10.720 
awesome experience I ended up leaving

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:14.099 
awesome experience I ended up leaving
the<00:04:10.989> island<00:04:11.140> shortly<00:04:11.650> after<00:04:12.569> moving<00:04:13.569> off<00:04:13.900> of

beautiful beach that I spent a lot of
time<00:04:25.800> on

00:04:30.749 --> 00:04:30.759 

00:04:30.759 --> 00:04:34.829 

it's<00:04:31.629> nice<00:04:31.900> because<00:04:32.319> there's<00:04:33.249> reef<00:04:33.789> off<00:04:34.330> the

00:04:34.829 --> 00:04:34.839 
it's nice because there's reef off the

00:04:34.839 --> 00:04:38.209 
it's nice because there's reef off the
beach<00:04:35.650> here<00:04:35.919> so<00:04:36.189> the<00:04:36.339> the<00:04:36.789> big<00:04:36.969> waves<00:04:37.180> break

00:04:38.209 --> 00:04:38.219 
beach here so the the big waves break

00:04:38.219 --> 00:04:40.950 
beach here so the the big waves break
further<00:04:39.219> out<00:04:39.460> and<00:04:39.490> so<00:04:39.939> it's<00:04:40.089> relatively<00:04:40.479> calm

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:40.960 
further out and so it's relatively calm

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:43.200 
further out and so it's relatively calm
here<00:04:41.710> as<00:04:41.979> you<00:04:42.129> can<00:04:42.309> see<00:04:42.550> there's<00:04:42.759> also<00:04:42.909> a<00:04:43.029> lot

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:43.210 
here as you can see there's also a lot

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:44.730 
here as you can see there's also a lot
of<00:04:43.240> reef<00:04:43.629> in<00:04:43.809> the<00:04:43.839> way<00:04:44.020> so<00:04:44.080> you<00:04:44.289> have<00:04:44.349> to<00:04:44.529> find

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:44.740 
of reef in the way so you have to find

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:48.089 
of reef in the way so you have to find
the<00:04:45.719> sort<00:04:46.719> of<00:04:46.779> breaks<00:04:47.110> in<00:04:47.319> the<00:04:47.409> reef<00:04:47.589> where<00:04:48.009> you

00:04:48.089 --> 00:04:48.099 
the sort of breaks in the reef where you

00:04:48.099 --> 00:04:51.029 
the sort of breaks in the reef where you
can<00:04:48.719> walk<00:04:49.719> in<00:04:49.779> easier<00:04:50.379> where<00:04:50.740> it<00:04:50.830> gets<00:04:50.949> a

00:04:51.029 --> 00:04:51.039 
can walk in easier where it gets a

00:04:51.039 --> 00:04:53.330 
can walk in easier where it gets a
little<00:04:51.129> bit<00:04:51.370> deeper<00:04:51.900> there

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:53.340 
little bit deeper there

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:55.850 
little bit deeper there
the<00:04:53.580> better<00:04:53.820> prospect<00:04:54.450> down<00:04:54.660> there<00:04:54.990> there's

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:55.860 
the better prospect down there there's

00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:00.650 
the better prospect down there there's
another<00:04:56.430> spot<00:04:56.760> that<00:04:57.980> has<00:04:58.980> some<00:04:59.220> more<00:05:00.120> less

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:00.660 
another spot that has some more less

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:02.000 
another spot that has some more less
reef<00:05:00.870> in<00:05:01.050> the<00:05:01.139> way<00:05:01.260> and<00:05:01.440> so<00:05:01.530> it's<00:05:01.650> easier<00:05:01.919> to

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:02.010 
reef in the way and so it's easier to

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:05.210 
reef in the way and so it's easier to
swim<00:05:02.630> but<00:05:03.630> anyway<00:05:04.169> as<00:05:04.290> you<00:05:04.380> can<00:05:04.500> see<00:05:04.650> really

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:05.220 
swim but anyway as you can see really

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:10.460 
swim but anyway as you can see really
