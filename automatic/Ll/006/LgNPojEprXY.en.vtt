comfortable<00:03:33.800> I'm<00:03:34.800> also<00:03:34.920> using<00:03:35.100> the<00:03:35.250> Alt<00:03:35.460> key

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:35.550 
comfortable I'm also using the Alt key

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:37.430 
comfortable I'm also using the Alt key
to<00:03:35.880> switch<00:03:36.060> over<00:03:36.480> to<00:03:36.510> the<00:03:36.720> numbers<00:03:37.110> and<00:03:37.290> as

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
to switch over to the numbers and as

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:42.110 
to switch over to the numbers and as
well<00:03:37.680> as<00:03:37.830> your<00:03:38.100> other<00:03:40.280> you<00:03:41.280> know<00:03:41.400> connotations

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
well as your other you know connotations

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:43.430 
well as your other you know connotations
like<00:03:42.240> your<00:03:42.540> full<00:03:42.780> stop<00:03:43.020> and<00:03:43.290> you<00:03:43.380> know

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 
like your full stop and you know

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.890 
like your full stop and you know
semicolons<00:03:44.370> work<00:03:44.640> very<00:03:44.910> well<00:03:44.970> the<00:03:45.540> keyboard

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
semicolons work very well the keyboard

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:47.690 
semicolons work very well the keyboard
smooth<00:03:46.260> it's<00:03:46.500> easy<00:03:46.740> it's<00:03:47.010> also<00:03:47.130> very<00:03:47.400> easy<00:03:47.580> to

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:47.700 
smooth it's easy it's also very easy to

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:49.880 
smooth it's easy it's also very easy to
use<00:03:47.850> one-handed<00:03:48.660> so<00:03:48.780> you<00:03:48.870> can<00:03:49.020> see<00:03:49.200> I<00:03:49.440> can

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:49.890 
use one-handed so you can see I can

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:51.860 
use one-handed so you can see I can
reach<00:03:50.070> all<00:03:50.250> the<00:03:50.550> different<00:03:50.880> keys<00:03:51.150> whenever<00:03:51.780> I

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870 
reach all the different keys whenever I

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:55.190 
reach all the different keys whenever I
choose<00:03:52.260> and<00:03:52.680> that<00:03:53.520> you<00:03:54.480> know<00:03:54.660> shouldn't<00:03:54.990> be<00:03:55.170> a

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 
choose and that you know shouldn't be a

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.740 
choose and that you know shouldn't be a
problem<00:03:55.410> there<00:03:55.890> so<00:03:56.220> it's<00:03:56.700> something<00:03:56.910> as<00:03:57.660> you

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750 
problem there so it's something as you

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:00.470 
problem there so it's something as you
can<00:03:57.900> see<00:03:58.080> it's<00:03:58.260> quite<00:03:58.410> easy<00:03:58.650> to<00:03:59.210> basically<00:04:00.210> hit

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
can see it's quite easy to basically hit

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.120 
can see it's quite easy to basically hit
the<00:04:00.690> keys<00:04:00.960> but<00:04:01.290> again<00:04:01.530> it<00:04:01.650> takes<00:04:01.860> some<00:04:02.100> getting

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:02.130 
the keys but again it takes some getting

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:04.340 
the keys but again it takes some getting
used<00:04:02.520> to<00:04:02.640> get<00:04:02.940> back<00:04:03.300> to<00:04:03.570> using<00:04:03.750> the<00:04:03.960> keyboard

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:04.350 
used to get back to using the keyboard

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:06.440 
used to get back to using the keyboard
but<00:04:04.560> I<00:04:04.740> do<00:04:05.100> like<00:04:05.430> it<00:04:05.610> I<00:04:05.700> think<00:04:05.790> he<00:04:06.000> works<00:04:06.210> well<00:04:06.420> I

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.450 
but I do like it I think he works well I

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:08.150 
but I do like it I think he works well I
think<00:04:06.540> that<00:04:06.930> great<00:04:07.110> has<00:04:07.200> done<00:04:07.380> a<00:04:07.410> very<00:04:08.070> good

job here in in marrying the keyboard and

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:13.400 
job here in in marrying the keyboard and
the<00:04:11.130> touchscreen<00:04:11.520> us<00:04:12.180> you<00:04:12.660> know<00:04:12.780> something<00:04:13.230> I

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:13.410 
the touchscreen us you know something I

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:14.930 
the touchscreen us you know something I
would<00:04:13.590> like<00:04:13.740> to<00:04:13.860> see<00:04:14.070> is<00:04:14.220> for<00:04:14.430> them<00:04:14.520> to<00:04:14.670> find

would like to see is for them to find
should<00:04:15.240> give<00:04:15.600> uses<00:04:16.140> an<00:04:16.290> easy<00:04:16.530> way<00:04:16.770> to<00:04:16.799> head

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:17.100 
should give uses an easy way to head

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:19.099 
should give uses an easy way to head
back<00:04:17.280> home<00:04:17.489> it<00:04:18.000> might<00:04:18.270> be<00:04:18.450> a<00:04:18.480> little<00:04:18.690> confusing

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:19.109 
back home it might be a little confusing

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:21.170 
back home it might be a little confusing

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 
because once you get into an application

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:24.200 
because once you get into an application
you<00:04:22.109> have<00:04:22.290> no<00:04:22.650> on-screen<00:04:23.280> cues<00:04:23.610> to<00:04:23.760> say<00:04:23.940> hey

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:27.200 
remember you have to slide out from them

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:32.200

application here it's actually add to
the<00:04:33.740> home<00:04:34.550> screen<00:04:34.790> so<00:04:35.270> that's<00:04:35.390> the<00:04:35.540> only<00:04:35.600> thing

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:35.810 
the home screen so that's the only thing

the home screen so that's the only thing
I<00:04:35.930> will<00:04:36.380> mention<00:04:36.500> I<00:04:36.770> tend<00:04:37.010> to<00:04:37.070> the<00:04:37.190> camera<00:04:37.580> it's

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:41.540 
the same camera you have with the z10 so

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:42.910 
the same camera you have with the z10 so
but<00:04:41.780> it<00:04:41.870> does<00:04:41.990> take<00:04:42.170> some<00:04:42.200> very<00:04:42.470> good<00:04:42.590> steals

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:42.920 
but it does take some very good steals

that<00:05:26.909> fun<00:05:27.120> stuff

00:05:27.589 --> 00:05:27.599 
that fun stuff

00:05:27.599 --> 00:05:30.020 
that fun stuff
overall<00:05:28.110> I<00:05:28.379> do<00:05:28.560> like<00:05:28.889> the<00:05:29.009> q10<00:05:29.460> I<00:05:29.580> think<00:05:29.849> this

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:30.030 
overall I do like the q10 I think this

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:31.700 
overall I do like the q10 I think this
is<00:05:30.180> a<00:05:30.210> step<00:05:30.659> forward<00:05:30.689> I<00:05:31.080> think<00:05:31.110> BlackBerry

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:31.710 
is a step forward I think BlackBerry

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:34.399 
is a step forward I think BlackBerry
should<00:05:31.949> actually<00:05:32.159> make<00:05:32.490> more<00:05:33.409> devices

00:05:34.399 --> 00:05:34.409 
should actually make more devices

00:05:34.409 --> 00:05:36.619 
should actually make more devices
recorded<00:05:34.949> keyboards<00:05:35.340> I<00:05:35.430> think<00:05:35.639> that's<00:05:35.789> a<00:05:35.939> sign

00:05:36.619 --> 00:05:36.629 
recorded keyboards I think that's a sign

00:05:36.629 --> 00:05:38.839 
recorded keyboards I think that's a sign
of<00:05:36.689> the<00:05:36.870> market<00:05:37.169> that<00:05:37.289> no<00:05:37.499> one<00:05:37.680> is<00:05:37.830> you<00:05:38.310> know<00:05:38.430> is

00:05:38.839 --> 00:05:38.849 
of the market that no one is you know is

00:05:38.849 --> 00:05:40.850 
of the market that no one is you know is
doing<00:05:39.090> anything<00:05:39.479> I<00:05:39.719> think<00:05:39.870> if<00:05:40.169> they<00:05:40.319> stuck<00:05:40.710> to

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:40.860 
doing anything I think if they stuck to

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:42.559 
doing anything I think if they stuck to
that<00:05:40.889> I<00:05:41.069> think<00:05:41.430> they<00:05:41.520> will<00:05:41.669> achieve<00:05:41.759> a<00:05:41.999> lot<00:05:42.330> but

00:05:42.559 --> 00:05:42.569 
that I think they will achieve a lot but

00:05:42.569 --> 00:05:44.779 
that I think they will achieve a lot but
I<00:05:42.779> like<00:05:43.229> the<00:05:43.379> q10<00:05:43.770> I<00:05:43.830> like<00:05:44.069> the<00:05:44.219> feel<00:05:44.430> it<00:05:44.580> feels
