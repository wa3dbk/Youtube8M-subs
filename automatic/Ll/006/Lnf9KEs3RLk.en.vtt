00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
thought it wasn't as good as devil may

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.740 
thought it wasn't as good as devil may
cry<00:01:34.290> but<00:01:34.860> that's<00:01:35.040> just<00:01:35.189> my<00:01:35.340> opinion<00:01:35.369> but<00:01:36.000> I'm

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750
