called a CD I took a little box that
generates<00:00:57.940> all<00:00:58.180> the<00:00:58.360> electricity<00:00:58.809> and

00:00:59.250 --> 00:00:59.260 
generates all the electricity and

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:04.189 
generates all the electricity and
scooter<00:00:59.860> and<00:01:00.070> gives<00:01:00.699> a<00:01:02.010> sense<00:01:03.010> spark<00:01:03.460> to<00:01:03.670> your

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
what they were thinking a little a

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:25.900 
what they were thinking a little a
little<00:02:22.430> down<00:02:22.730> bar<00:02:23.030> down<00:02:23.239> there<00:02:23.770> but<00:02:24.770> um<00:02:24.950> and

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
little down bar down there but um and

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:28.240 
little down bar down there but um and
that's<00:02:26.420> all<00:02:26.660> one<00:02:27.350> of<00:02:27.380> the<00:02:27.530> cheap<00:02:27.800> mods<00:02:28.069> you

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
that's all one of the cheap mods you

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:31.420 
that's all one of the cheap mods you
could<00:02:28.430> do<00:02:28.520> another<00:02:28.790> one<00:02:29.060> is<00:02:29.270> um<00:02:29.800> you<00:02:30.800> could<00:02:30.950> put

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
could do another one is um you could put

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:34.809 
could do another one is um you could put
it<00:02:31.550> on<00:02:31.580> race<00:02:32.060> and<00:02:32.090> uh<00:02:32.420> pull<00:02:32.870> it<00:02:33.020> on<00:02:33.170> and<00:02:33.530> I<00:02:34.519> think

00:02:34.809 --> 00:02:34.819 
it on race and uh pull it on and I think

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:38.050 
it on race and uh pull it on and I think
they<00:02:34.970> usually<00:02:35.590> the<00:02:36.590> standard<00:02:36.800> coils<00:02:37.459> are<00:02:37.640> all

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:38.060 
they usually the standard coils are all

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:41.800 
they usually the standard coils are all
black<00:02:38.540> and<00:02:39.500> yeah<00:02:40.030> Racing<00:02:41.030> ones<00:02:41.269> I<00:02:41.450> guess<00:02:41.630> they

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
black and yeah Racing ones I guess they

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:47.020 
black and yeah Racing ones I guess they

more<00:02:49.310> spark<00:02:50.050> it's<00:02:51.050> gonna<00:02:51.260> it's<00:02:51.530> gonna

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
more spark it's gonna it's gonna

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.460 
more spark it's gonna it's gonna
generate<00:02:51.950> more<00:02:52.400> spark<00:02:52.850> and<00:02:53.780> it's<00:02:54.049> gonna<00:02:54.200> have

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 
generate more spark and it's gonna have

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:56.740 
generate more spark and it's gonna have
a<00:02:54.500> less<00:02:54.920> wasted<00:02:55.459> spark<00:02:55.790> because<00:02:56.390> it'll<00:02:56.630> wipe

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
a less wasted spark because it'll wipe

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:58.930 
a less wasted spark because it'll wipe
there's<00:02:57.049> more<00:02:57.260> windings<00:02:57.799> in<00:02:57.980> the<00:02:58.100> corridor

00:02:58.930 --> 00:02:58.940 
there's more windings in the corridor

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:03.370 
there's more windings in the corridor
why<00:02:59.150> I'm<00:02:59.450> stuck<00:02:59.750> so<00:03:00.940> if<00:03:01.940> you<00:03:02.380> actually

lot kid I think for like $100 I gave

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:17.740 
lot kid I think for like $100 I gave
them<00:03:13.070> the<00:03:14.590> CDI<00:03:15.590> with<00:03:16.190> the<00:03:16.340> coil<00:03:16.700> and<00:03:17.060> then<00:03:17.630> you

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750 
them the CDI with the coil and then you

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:20.289 
them the CDI with the coil and then you
can<00:03:17.900> buy<00:03:18.049> a<00:03:18.079> little<00:03:18.380> around<00:03:18.590> on<00:03:18.940> run<00:03:19.940> air

00:03:20.289 --> 00:03:20.299 
can buy a little around on run air

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:31.020 
can buy a little around on run air
filter

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:31.030 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:38.220 

smaller<00:03:34.150> deaf<00:03:35.150> cores<00:03:35.420> like<00:03:35.480> media<00:03:36.050> coverage

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:38.230 
smaller deaf cores like media coverage

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:41.830 
smaller deaf cores like media coverage
so<00:03:39.230> it<00:03:39.920> was<00:03:40.040> like<00:03:40.220> $100<00:03:41.000> and<00:03:41.239> they<00:03:41.420> gave<00:03:41.630> you

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:47.030 
the little air shelter the coil the CDI

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:49.540 
the little air shelter the coil the CDI
and<00:03:47.450> they<00:03:48.260> actually<00:03:48.650> gave<00:03:48.830> you<00:03:48.980> a<00:03:49.010> race<00:03:49.310> in

carburetor<00:03:50.090> -<00:03:50.650> no<00:03:51.650> it<00:03:51.890> was<00:03:52.010> a<00:03:52.040> pretty<00:03:52.550> jetta

00:03:52.809 --> 00:03:52.819 
carburetor - no it was a pretty jetta

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:56.259 
carburetor - no it was a pretty jetta
carburetor<00:03:53.450> so<00:03:53.840> long<00:03:54.290> it<00:03:55.280> was<00:03:55.310> jetted<00:03:55.910> I<00:03:56.000> think

00:03:56.259 --> 00:03:56.269 
carburetor so long it was jetted I think

00:03:56.269 --> 00:03:58.180 
carburetor so long it was jetted I think
two<00:03:56.510> or<00:03:56.569> three<00:03:56.690> times<00:03:57.050> bigger<00:03:57.440> and<00:03:57.800> with<00:03:58.069> the

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:58.190 
two or three times bigger and with the

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:00.430 
two or three times bigger and with the
jet<00:03:58.430> Jets<00:03:58.819> are<00:03:59.030> inside<00:03:59.360> the<00:03:59.510> carburetor<00:03:59.750> is<00:04:00.200> on

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:00.440 
jet Jets are inside the carburetor is on

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:03.600 
jet Jets are inside the carburetor is on
you<00:04:01.400> have<00:04:01.549> a<00:04:01.580> high<00:04:02.180> speed<00:04:02.239> and<00:04:02.750> a<00:04:02.840> low<00:04:03.019> speed

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:03.610 
you have a high speed and a low speed

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:06.070 
you have a high speed and a low speed
you<00:04:04.610> have<00:04:04.730> an<00:04:04.850> idle<00:04:05.180> and<00:04:05.330> jet<00:04:05.540> boat<00:04:05.780> so<00:04:05.959> when

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:06.080 
you have an idle and jet boat so when

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:07.750 
you have an idle and jet boat so when
you're<00:04:06.200> idle<00:04:06.470> and<00:04:06.620> gas<00:04:06.860> is<00:04:07.100> flowing<00:04:07.340> through

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:07.760 
you're idle and gas is flowing through

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:09.490 
you're idle and gas is flowing through
it<00:04:07.910> and<00:04:08.420> then<00:04:08.690> when<00:04:08.840> you<00:04:08.930> give<00:04:09.110> it<00:04:09.260> the<00:04:09.350> gas

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:09.500 
it and then when you give it the gas

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:11.770 
it and then when you give it the gas
about<00:04:09.860> a<00:04:09.920> take<00:04:10.160> off<00:04:10.370> the<00:04:10.580> gas<00:04:10.760> flow<00:04:11.390> them<00:04:11.600> to<00:04:11.750> a

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:11.780 
about a take off the gas flow them to a

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:14.410 
about a take off the gas flow them to a
larger<00:04:12.319> tube<00:04:12.530> and<00:04:12.980> that's<00:04:13.700> called<00:04:14.030> germane

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:14.420 
larger tube and that's called germane

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:17.020 
larger tube and that's called germane
jet<00:04:14.750> and<00:04:14.959> that's<00:04:15.230> how<00:04:15.380> the<00:04:15.440> gas<00:04:16.430> flows<00:04:16.729> in<00:04:16.940> the

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:17.030 
jet and that's how the gas flows in the

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:20.020 
jet and that's how the gas flows in the
carburetor<00:04:17.450> so<00:04:18.040> with<00:04:19.040> uh<00:04:19.070> with<00:04:19.820> that<00:04:19.850> being

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:20.030 
carburetor so with uh with that being

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:22.659 
carburetor so with uh with that being
Jetta<00:04:20.690> bigger<00:04:20.989> that<00:04:21.350> let<00:04:22.010> your<00:04:22.130> school<00:04:22.370> do<00:04:22.520> go

00:04:22.659 --> 00:04:22.669 
Jetta bigger that let your school do go

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:25.480 
Jetta bigger that let your school do go

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:25.490 
faster so that comes in all a kit so you

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:29.379 
faster so that comes in all a kit so you
get<00:04:25.760> that<00:04:26.440> pre<00:04:27.440> Jetta<00:04:27.710> carburetor<00:04:28.340> and<00:04:28.700> all

00:04:29.379 --> 00:04:29.389 
get that pre Jetta carburetor and all

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:31.210 
get that pre Jetta carburetor and all
you<00:04:29.479> do<00:04:29.660> is<00:04:29.690> just<00:04:29.990> remove<00:04:30.500> your<00:04:30.680> old<00:04:30.830> one<00:04:31.130> and

you do is just remove your old one and

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:33.909 
you do is just remove your old one and
put<00:04:31.310> the<00:04:31.490> new<00:04:31.639> one<00:04:31.820> on<00:04:31.960> with<00:04:32.960> the<00:04:33.140> little<00:04:33.740> air

00:04:33.909 --> 00:04:33.919 
put the new one on with the little air

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:36.990 
put the new one on with the little air
filter<00:04:34.400> intake<00:04:34.789> and<00:04:35.390> then<00:04:35.750> you<00:04:35.810> just<00:04:35.990> pop<00:04:36.200> your

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:37.000 
filter intake and then you just pop your

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.380 
filter intake and then you just pop your
coil<00:04:38.000> on<00:04:38.300> you<00:04:38.450> see<00:04:38.660> the<00:04:38.780> ion<00:04:39.229> and<00:04:40.240> you<00:04:41.240> could

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:41.390 
coil on you see the ion and you could

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:44.350 
coil on you see the ion and you could
probably<00:04:41.600> get<00:04:41.900> a<00:04:42.350> third<00:04:42.710> and<00:04:43.010> I'm<00:04:43.160> fifty<00:04:43.910> CC

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:44.360 
probably get a third and I'm fifty CC

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:46.420 
probably get a third and I'm fifty CC
scooter<00:04:44.720> to<00:04:44.900> go<00:04:45.080> from<00:04:45.289> my<00:04:45.410> thirty<00:04:45.740> miles<00:04:46.070> now

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:52.100 
so I mean that's a really easy cheap

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:55.990 
so I mean that's a really easy cheap
just<00:04:52.430> hold<00:04:53.120> on<00:04:53.419> tight<00:04:53.690> mod<00:04:53.990> I<00:04:54.789> mean<00:04:55.789> you<00:04:55.850> will
