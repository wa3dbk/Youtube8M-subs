00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
hallucinations start to activate and you

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.930 
hallucinations start to activate and you
after<00:02:12.019> you<00:02:12.110> clear<00:02:12.380> the<00:02:12.560> vents<00:02:12.950> but<00:02:13.670> then<00:02:13.819> you

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940 
after you clear the vents but then you

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.839 
after you clear the vents but then you

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:22.150 
that it is golden Freddy and if this is

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:24.450 
that it is golden Freddy and if this is
golden<00:04:22.600> Freddy<00:04:22.930> the<00:04:23.470> Freddy<00:04:23.770> on<00:04:23.920> the<00:04:24.010> left<00:04:24.280> of

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:24.460 
golden Freddy the Freddy on the left of

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:27.270 
golden Freddy the Freddy on the left of
the<00:04:24.550> office<00:04:24.910> is<00:04:25.480> shadow<00:04:25.780> Freddy<00:04:26.170> unless<00:04:27.160> you

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:27.280 
the office is shadow Freddy unless you

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:28.770 
the office is shadow Freddy unless you
wanted<00:04:27.550> to<00:04:27.700> put<00:04:28.090> on<00:04:28.180> another<00:04:28.420> hallucination

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:28.780 
wanted to put on another hallucination

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:30.870 
wanted to put on another hallucination
of<00:04:29.380> golden<00:04:29.800> Freddy<00:04:30.070> which<00:04:30.250> would<00:04:30.430> be<00:04:30.580> weird

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:30.880 
of golden Freddy which would be weird

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:34.380 
of golden Freddy which would be weird
and<00:04:31.240> but<00:04:32.140> that<00:04:32.320> could<00:04:32.950> probably<00:04:33.130> be<00:04:33.460> purple

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:34.390 
and but that could probably be purple

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:36.120 
and but that could probably be purple
Freddy<00:04:34.600> if<00:04:34.870> this<00:04:35.050> is<00:04:35.200> confirmed<00:04:35.620> now<00:04:35.920> that

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:36.130 
Freddy if this is confirmed now that

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:38.640 
Freddy if this is confirmed now that
funds<00:04:36.370> and<00:04:36.610> Freddy's<00:04:36.880> golden<00:04:37.360> Freddy<00:04:37.650> the

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:38.650 
funds and Freddy's golden Freddy the

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:40.290 
funds and Freddy's golden Freddy the
Freddy<00:04:38.920> on<00:04:39.100> the<00:04:39.250> left<00:04:39.460> is<00:04:39.670> shadow<00:04:39.910> Freddy

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:40.300 
Freddy on the left is shadow Freddy

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:42.570 
Freddy on the left is shadow Freddy
because<00:04:41.020> again<00:04:41.320> if<00:04:41.620> you<00:04:41.680> look<00:04:42.010> on<00:04:42.160> the<00:04:42.280> files

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:42.580 
because again if you look on the files

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:45.000 
because again if you look on the files
it<00:04:42.910> says<00:04:43.120> shadow<00:04:43.390> Freddy<00:04:43.810> here<00:04:44.230> so<00:04:44.740> if<00:04:44.800> there's

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:45.010 
it says shadow Freddy here so if there's

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:46.650 
it says shadow Freddy here so if there's
no<00:04:45.220> such<00:04:45.430> thing<00:04:45.730> as<00:04:45.850> shadow<00:04:46.120> Freddy<00:04:46.480> in<00:04:46.630> the

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:46.660 
no such thing as shadow Freddy in the

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:49.700 
no such thing as shadow Freddy in the
whole<00:04:46.990> game<00:04:47.410> why<00:04:48.040> Scott<00:04:48.490> put<00:04:48.730> it<00:04:48.850> in<00:04:48.940> the<00:04:49.060> foils

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:49.710

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:53.250 
whole game why Scott put it in the foils
exactly<00:04:50.710> on<00:04:50.920> the<00:04:51.220> left<00:04:51.490> its<00:04:51.790> shadow<00:04:52.030> Freddy<00:04:52.510> so

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:53.260

say<00:05:44.620> you<00:05:45.040> know<00:05:45.070> Freddy's<00:05:45.910> not<00:05:46.120> in<00:05:46.300> it<00:05:46.540> Bonnie's

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:46.960

not in it and I think it's because he
wanted<00:05:48.790> to<00:05:48.940> limit<00:05:49.180> the<00:05:49.419> hallucinations<00:05:50.230> he
