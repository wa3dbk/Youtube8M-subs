00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.120
 hello company hikvision 

00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:06.730
 released an update of its programs 

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:11.259
 glow for automotive devices on 

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:14.409
 Apple ios is called a base weight of 4500 

00:00:11.259 --> 00:00:16.780
 hd works on ipad 3 in this case 

00:00:14.409 --> 00:00:19.210
 so we need to go to 

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:20.650
 settings add camera we choose but 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:22.360
 I have previously added something here 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:24.720
 have choose on what basis they 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:27.340
 work on ip address in this case and 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:30.340
 accordingly we bring down the address name 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:32.349
 I have a username and password here 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:35.320
 added as megapixel cameras so 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:39.280
 and swivel aids for example 514 7 st 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:41.050
 153 mini house street will be 8 253 864 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:43.079
 wide dynamic range and 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:48.120
 after all, four-channel DVR 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:50.559
 72 series go to the live view 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.629
 mean to look 

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:55.420
 just drag dragon drop 

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:57.429
 camera on screen if it is pivoting 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:01.079
 the camera then we have this 

00:00:57.429 --> 00:01:04.989
 control when we using arrows 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:07.480
 rotate closer and remove and 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:09.580
 It is natural then to hide Anton about 

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:12.340
 approximation works for us 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:14.800
 way if we turn the camera on the whole 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:19.870
 the screen then we have here such 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:26.290
 control chick just dragging the camera can 

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:28.990
 manage it if we want to see 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:30.820
 at the same time several chamber screen 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:32.350
 templates are automatically created as 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:35.050
 only we drag the next camera 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:37.150
 on the screen for example 4 krator immediately 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:39.850
 the second camera we can here 4 cameras 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:43.240
 post for note that if 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:46.540
 megapixel camera then the program will 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:48.160
 show only keyframes if 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:52.020
 we'll try dragging more 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:54.940
 first we have 9 krator 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:57.190
 there is again we will try to add it 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:02:01.710
 then the maximum program allows 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:01.710
 watch up to 16 channels simultaneously 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:06.660
 distinctive feature of this 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:07.850
 programs is also something that can 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:10.530
 view archive 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:12.960
 if we add a device here for example 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:17.160
 built-in recorder 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:18.360
 hard disk choose date and time u10 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:23.520
 date and time are selected 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:25.590
 but also drag we will see the timeline so 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:28.410
 what we have refused to add now 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:32.090
 wait a second here and now we 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:33.210
 will see the signals respectively on 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:34.800
 the monitor 

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:41.130
 start using the timeline we can 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:42.870
 navigate through time deploy 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:45.330
 some kind of camera full screen do 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:47.370
 screenshot pause or even show on 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.600
 full screen there case here too 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:52.620
 present management using 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:55.680
 timeline and here is such a new convenient 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:57.990
 the application created a vision hit for 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.220
 view your ip camcorders and 

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:02.870
 video recorders 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:02.870
 Thanks for attention
