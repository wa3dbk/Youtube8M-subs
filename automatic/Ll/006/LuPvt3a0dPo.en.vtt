00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
the a string so let's take a look II

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:15.799 
the a string so let's take a look II
remember<00:00:14.429> we<00:00:14.940> had<00:00:15.059> just<00:00:15.179> finished<00:00:15.450> playing

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
the barre chord 7 but yeah it can be

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.450 
the barre chord 7 but yeah it can be
hard<00:00:18.960> on<00:00:19.050> your<00:00:19.170> hand<00:00:19.380> to<00:00:19.470> do<00:00:19.590> a<00:00:19.619> lot<00:00:19.830> of<00:00:19.859> this

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:21.460 
hard on your hand to do a lot of this

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:24.590 
hard on your hand to do a lot of this
especially<00:00:22.179> on<00:00:22.300> an<00:00:22.390> acoustic<00:00:22.660> guitar

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
especially on an acoustic guitar

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.609 
especially on an acoustic guitar
though<00:00:25.600> it<00:00:25.750> is<00:00:25.840> valuable<00:00:26.440> still<00:00:28.140> so<00:00:29.140> let's<00:00:29.350> try

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:29.619 
though it is valuable still so let's try

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:31.320 
though it is valuable still so let's try
creating<00:00:29.920> another<00:00:30.369> shape<00:00:30.700> for<00:00:30.910> the<00:00:31.000> seventh

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:31.330 
creating another shape for the seventh

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:33.799 
creating another shape for the seventh
chord<00:00:31.600> well<00:00:32.259> if<00:00:32.380> we<00:00:32.470> use<00:00:32.619> our<00:00:32.770> third<00:00:33.010> finger

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
chord well if we use our third finger

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:39.420 
chord well if we use our third finger

finger to play the fourth fret of the D
you're<00:00:43.750> going<00:00:43.870> to<00:00:43.930> use<00:00:44.019> our<00:00:44.760> second<00:00:45.760> finger<00:00:45.790> we

you're going to use our second finger we

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:48.240 
you're going to use our second finger we
can<00:00:46.269> use<00:00:46.360> our<00:00:46.449> fourth<00:00:46.750> finger<00:00:46.809> to<00:00:47.170> play<00:00:47.290> the

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:50.080 
fifth fret of the g and our first

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:51.869 
fifth fret of the g and our first
pointer<00:00:50.440> finger<00:00:50.830> plays<00:00:51.010> the<00:00:51.190> 3rd<00:00:51.400> fret<00:00:51.580> of<00:00:51.699> the

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:54.660 
pointer finger plays the 3rd fret of the
B<00:00:51.940> string

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:54.670 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:56.610 

so<00:00:55.300> our<00:00:55.480> fingers<00:00:55.899> are<00:00:55.989> in<00:00:56.109> commission<00:00:56.500> on

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:56.620 
so our fingers are in commission on

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:58.650 
so our fingers are in commission on
different<00:00:56.949> strings

00:00:58.650 --> 00:00:58.660 
different strings

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:01.410 
different strings
and<00:00:58.840> this<00:00:59.500> creates<00:00:59.950> a<00:01:00.190> set<00:01:00.550> movable<00:01:01.060> seventh

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:01.420 
and this creates a set movable seventh

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:04.820 
and this creates a set movable seventh
type<00:01:01.600> as<00:01:01.780> long<00:01:01.930> as<00:01:02.050> we<00:01:02.170> only<00:01:02.290> strum<00:01:02.680> between<00:01:03.280> a

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
type as long as we only strum between a

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.870 
type as long as we only strum between a
and<00:01:05.450> b<00:01:06.560> we<00:01:07.560> can<00:01:07.590> do<00:01:07.830> this<00:01:07.950> net<00:01:08.220> we<00:01:08.400> move<00:01:08.580> this<00:01:08.730> up

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
and b we can do this net we move this up

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:18.550 
and b we can do this net we move this up
one<00:01:09.150> give<00:01:10.020> a<00:01:10.050> B<00:01:10.380> flat<00:01:10.410> seven<00:01:11.340> chord

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:26.959 

this<00:01:19.560> would<00:01:19.710> be<00:01:19.890> an<00:01:20.130> f<00:01:20.700> 74<00:01:23.990> yes<00:01:25.700> so<00:01:26.700> remember

00:01:26.959 --> 00:01:26.969 
this would be an f 74 yes so remember

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:32.959 
this would be an f 74 yes so remember
this<00:01:27.179> was<00:01:27.360> D<00:01:27.600> E<00:01:28.159> flat<00:01:30.079> and<00:01:31.079> F<00:01:31.609> try<00:01:32.609> moving

00:01:32.959 --> 00:01:32.969 
this was D E flat and F try moving

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:36.380 
this was D E flat and F try moving
around<00:01:33.060> this<00:01:33.420> board<00:01:33.829> now<00:01:34.829> if<00:01:35.549> we<00:01:36.090> take<00:01:36.119> our
