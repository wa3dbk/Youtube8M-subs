but<00:02:13.650> now<00:02:13.770> this<00:02:13.980> is<00:02:14.130> where<00:02:14.250> it<00:02:14.310> all<00:02:14.580> goes

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:14.820 
but now this is where it all goes

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:16.580 
but now this is where it all goes
horribly<00:02:14.880> wrong<00:02:15.240> for<00:02:15.450> me<00:02:15.780> it's<00:02:16.200> probably<00:02:16.500> a

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
horribly wrong for me it's probably a

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.290 
horribly wrong for me it's probably a
lesson<00:02:16.890> on<00:02:16.980> why<00:02:17.370> you<00:02:17.430> shouldn't<00:02:17.940> bring<00:02:18.120> out

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
lesson on why you shouldn't bring out

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:19.910 
lesson on why you shouldn't bring out
your<00:02:18.480> goalkeeper<00:02:18.720> so<00:02:19.500> you<00:02:19.590> see<00:02:19.740> there

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
your goalkeeper so you see there

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.190 
your goalkeeper so you see there
Hernandez<00:02:20.490> gets<00:02:21.360> one<00:02:21.600> and<00:02:21.630> almost

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
Hernandez gets one and almost

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.870 
Hernandez gets one and almost
immediately<00:02:22.410> after<00:02:23.010> I<00:02:23.190> decided<00:02:23.700> to<00:02:23.790> bring
