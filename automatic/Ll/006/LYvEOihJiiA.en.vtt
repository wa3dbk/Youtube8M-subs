that<00:00:27.330> just<00:00:27.570> the<00:00:27.630> parking<00:00:27.960> lights<00:00:28.109> on<00:00:29.779> heads

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:32.780 
that just the parking lights on heads

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:35.810 

heads<00:00:33.780> and<00:00:34.020> fogs<00:00:34.340> pretty<00:00:35.340> big<00:00:35.489> difference

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
heads and fogs pretty big difference

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.440 
heads and fogs pretty big difference
it's<00:00:36.510> actually<00:00:36.870> not<00:00:37.140> quite<00:00:37.980> that<00:00:38.450> immersive

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
it's actually not quite that immersive

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.170 
it's actually not quite that immersive
there's<00:00:40.140> a<00:00:40.170> slight<00:00:40.440> kind<00:00:41.309> of<00:00:41.399> curvature<00:00:42.030> in

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
there's a slight kind of curvature in

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.729 
there's a slight kind of curvature in
the<00:00:42.300> road<00:00:42.450> I'm<00:00:42.570> have<00:00:42.719> pointing<00:00:43.140> downward<00:00:43.590> so

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
the road I'm have pointing downward so

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:44.810 
the road I'm have pointing downward so
it<00:00:43.800> actually<00:00:44.010> looks<00:00:44.129> more<00:00:44.309> apparent<00:00:44.640> than<00:00:44.670> it

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
it actually looks more apparent than it

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.430 
it actually looks more apparent than it
actually<00:00:44.910> is<00:00:45.120> when<00:00:45.989> driving<00:00:46.200> flat<00:00:46.910> and<00:00:48.440> that's

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
actually is when driving flat and that's

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.900 
actually is when driving flat and that's
just<00:00:49.890> the<00:00:49.980> fogs<00:00:50.219> by<00:00:50.460> themselves<00:00:51.680> and<00:00:52.910> again

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
just the fogs by themselves and again

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.720 
just the fogs by themselves and again
fogs<00:00:54.329> and<00:00:54.539> regular<00:00:54.920> and<00:00:56.480> as<00:00:57.480> a<00:00:57.510> comparison

00:00:58.720 --> 00:00:58.730 
fogs and regular and as a comparison

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:05.920 
fogs and regular and as a comparison
high<00:00:59.730> beams<00:01:02.359> back<00:01:03.359> to<00:01:03.510> regular<00:01:03.629> it<00:01:03.870> fogs

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:05.930 
high beams back to regular it fogs

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:11.660 
high beams back to regular it fogs
regular<00:01:08.390> just<00:01:09.390> fogs<00:01:09.630> so<00:01:10.460> looking<00:01:11.460> on<00:01:11.580> the

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
regular just fogs so looking on the

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.580 
regular just fogs so looking on the
pavement<00:01:12.090> it's<00:01:12.360> a<00:01:12.510> little<00:01:12.780> bit<00:01:12.869> purplish<00:01:13.350> and

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
pavement it's a little bit purplish and

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.380 
pavement it's a little bit purplish and
I'm<00:01:14.250> actually<00:01:14.460> starting<00:01:14.820> to<00:01:14.939> think<00:01:15.150> now<00:01:15.360> that

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
I'm actually starting to think now that

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:21.620 
I'm actually starting to think now that
it's<00:01:18.320> mainly<00:01:19.320> because<00:01:19.500> of<00:01:20.330> needing<00:01:21.330> to<00:01:21.420> burn

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
it's mainly because of needing to burn

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.310 
it's mainly because of needing to burn
in<00:01:21.900> because<00:01:22.740> as<00:01:22.890> I<00:01:22.950> look<00:01:23.100> at<00:01:23.220> them<00:01:23.310> now<00:01:24.320> they're

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
in because as I look at them now they're

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.219 
in because as I look at them now they're
actually<00:01:25.770> much<00:01:26.070> much<00:01:26.640> whiter<00:01:27.030> than<00:01:28.020> they<00:01:28.170> were

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
actually much much whiter than they were

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.520 
actually much much whiter than they were
this<00:01:28.710> morning<00:01:29.130> when<00:01:29.220> I<00:01:29.250> first<00:01:29.579> heard<00:01:29.790> of<00:01:29.850> on

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:32.530 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:35.640 

so<00:01:33.100> he<00:01:33.220> can<00:01:33.370> get<00:01:33.430> a<00:01:33.490> good<00:01:33.610> image<00:01:34.330> I'm<00:01:34.690> hoping<00:01:35.080> of

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:35.650 
so he can get a good image I'm hoping of

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:42.060 
so he can get a good image I'm hoping of
the<00:01:38.250> stock<00:01:39.250> halogens<00:01:39.820> and<00:01:40.560> the<00:01:41.560> Morimoto's

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:42.070 
the stock halogens and the Morimoto's

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:45.300 
the stock halogens and the Morimoto's
I'm<00:01:42.940> gonna<00:01:43.120> see<00:01:43.390> if<00:01:43.510> I<00:01:43.630> can<00:01:43.870> get<00:01:44.170> in<00:01:44.890> here

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:45.310 
I'm gonna see if I can get in here

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:54.100 
I'm gonna see if I can get in here
without<00:01:45.430> glaring<00:01:45.970> the<00:01:46.060> hell<00:01:46.210> out<00:01:46.330> of<00:01:46.450> the<00:01:46.510> lens

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:54.110 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:55.720 

and<00:01:54.710> if<00:01:54.890> you<00:01:54.980> care<00:01:55.160> with<00:01:55.250> what<00:01:55.400> it<00:01:55.460> looks<00:01:55.610> like

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:55.730 
and if you care with what it looks like

00:01:55.730 --> 00:02:00.910 
and if you care with what it looks like
down<00:01:56.510> low<00:01:57.670> kind<00:01:58.670> of<00:01:58.730> have<00:01:58.820> a<00:01:59.470> spot<00:02:00.470> there<00:02:00.740> then

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:00.920 
down low kind of have a spot there then

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:11.020 
down low kind of have a spot there then
trailing<00:02:01.310> up<00:02:01.400> to<00:02:01.520> the<00:02:01.930> full<00:02:02.930> beam<00:02:03.170> pattern<00:02:10.030> and

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 
trailing up to the full beam pattern and

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.980 
trailing up to the full beam pattern and
it's<00:02:11.540> a<00:02:11.630> hell<00:02:11.900> of<00:02:11.930> a<00:02:12.020> lot<00:02:12.140> whiter<00:02:12.430> I<00:02:13.780> will<00:02:14.780> stand

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:14.990 
it's a hell of a lot whiter I will stand

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:16.810 
it's a hell of a lot whiter I will stand
by<00:02:15.170> it<00:02:15.230> this<00:02:15.590> morning<00:02:15.860> they<00:02:16.250> were<00:02:16.280> right<00:02:16.730> in

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:16.820 
by it this morning they were right in

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:19.000 
by it this morning they were right in
the<00:02:16.880> 12,000<00:02:17.480> K<00:02:17.570> range<00:02:17.840> and<00:02:18.140> they<00:02:18.500> have<00:02:18.680> really

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
the 12,000 K range and they have really

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.220 
the 12,000 K range and they have really
whitened<00:02:19.580> up<00:02:19.730> so<00:02:20.480> maybe<00:02:20.630> it's<00:02:20.780> just<00:02:20.840> burnin

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
whitened up so maybe it's just burnin

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.380 
whitened up so maybe it's just burnin
they<00:02:21.320> need<00:02:21.440> to<00:02:21.590> burned<00:02:21.740> into<00:02:21.920> me<00:02:22.130> more<00:02:22.390> white

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
they need to burned into me more white

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:25.240 
they need to burned into me more white
over<00:02:23.630> time<00:02:23.840> but<00:02:24.350> they're<00:02:24.500> much<00:02:24.710> more<00:02:24.920> in<00:02:25.070> the

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
over time but they're much more in the

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:29.710 
over time but they're much more in the
that's<00:02:26.120> probably<00:02:26.390> close<00:02:26.570> to<00:02:26.600> 5500<00:02:27.260> so<00:02:28.600> let<00:02:29.600> him

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
that's probably close to 5500 so let him

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.480 
that's probably close to 5500 so let him
run<00:02:29.870> and<00:02:30.050> see<00:02:30.500> the<00:02:30.590> turn<00:02:30.740> colors<00:02:31.040> mine

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:31.490 
run and see the turn colors mine

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:36.280 
run and see the turn colors mine
definitely<00:02:31.820> did<00:02:32.320> hope<00:02:33.320> it<00:02:33.440> helps<00:02:33.709> enjoy
