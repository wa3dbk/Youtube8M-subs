had 180 grit sandpaper I think I should
have<00:02:22.239> should<00:02:22.599> have<00:02:22.659> had<00:02:22.930> something<00:02:23.319> like<00:02:23.849> 150

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
have should have had something like 150

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.740 
have should have had something like 150
120<00:02:26.549> we're<00:02:27.549> basically<00:02:27.700> sanding<00:02:28.299> off<00:02:28.420> the<00:02:28.629> edge

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
120 we're basically sanding off the edge

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:31.710 
120 we're basically sanding off the edge
pieces<00:02:29.140> and<00:02:29.650> sending<00:02:30.010> off<00:02:30.159> the<00:02:30.849> corners<00:02:31.390> took

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
pieces and sending off the corners took

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.770 
pieces and sending off the corners took
a<00:02:31.840> long<00:02:32.019> while<00:02:32.549> same<00:02:33.549> with<00:02:33.730> the<00:02:33.849> centerpieces

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
a long while same with the centerpieces

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:37.289 
a long while same with the centerpieces
and<00:02:34.959> that's<00:02:35.379> only<00:02:35.680> because<00:02:36.069> my<00:02:36.459> son<00:02:36.700> paper<00:02:36.970> was

00:02:37.289 --> 00:02:37.299 
and that's only because my son paper was

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:40.619 
and that's only because my son paper was
too<00:02:37.750> smooth<00:02:38.049> for<00:02:38.489> for<00:02:39.489> this<00:02:39.640> Fortescue<00:02:40.420> for

00:02:40.619 --> 00:02:40.629 
too smooth for for this Fortescue for

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:43.020 
too smooth for for this Fortescue for
this<00:02:40.780> plastic<00:02:41.310> but<00:02:42.310> the<00:02:42.459> cube<00:02:42.670> turned<00:02:42.879> out

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
this plastic but the cube turned out

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:45.899 
this plastic but the cube turned out
fine<00:02:43.269> I<00:02:43.540> didn't<00:02:43.930> over<00:02:44.170> muddy<00:02:44.409> mud<00:02:44.980> it<00:02:45.220> like<00:02:45.760> I

00:02:45.899 --> 00:02:45.909 
fine I didn't over muddy mud it like I

00:02:45.909 --> 00:02:50.670 
fine I didn't over muddy mud it like I
was<00:02:46.090> afraid<00:02:46.329> I<00:02:46.450> would<00:02:46.780> have<00:02:48.659> smooth<00:02:49.659> now<00:02:49.900> still

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680 
was afraid I would have smooth now still

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.160 
was afraid I would have smooth now still
have<00:02:50.829> to<00:02:50.950> break<00:02:51.159> it<00:02:51.280> in<00:02:51.370> though<00:02:51.730> it's<00:02:52.540> not<00:02:52.780> it's

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170 
have to break it in though it's not it's

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:57.300 
have to break it in though it's not it's
not<00:02:53.440> yet<00:02:54.060> perfect<00:02:55.060> and<00:02:56.069> as<00:02:57.069> I<00:02:57.280> mentioned

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
not yet perfect and as I mentioned

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:01.530 
not yet perfect and as I mentioned
earlier<00:02:57.879> these<00:02:58.480> are<00:02:58.750> they<00:02:59.220> that<00:03:00.220> keep<00:03:00.790> the

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540 
earlier these are they that keep the

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.089 
earlier these are they that keep the
cubicle<00:03:01.989> lot<00:03:02.170> us<00:03:02.739> half<00:03:03.159> break<00:03:03.549> right<00:03:04.239> stickers

00:03:05.089 --> 00:03:05.099 
cubicle lot us half break right stickers

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:08.280 
cubicle lot us half break right stickers
basically<00:03:06.099> the<00:03:06.819> difference<00:03:06.940> between<00:03:07.359> the

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.290 
basically the difference between the

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:10.319 
basically the difference between the
half<00:03:08.440> right<00:03:08.799> of<00:03:08.980> the<00:03:09.099> cubicle<00:03:09.609> and<00:03:09.819> the<00:03:10.180> half

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:10.329 
half right of the cubicle and the half

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:14.039 
half right of the cubicle and the half
right<00:03:10.629> of<00:03:10.840> iso<00:03:11.290> is<00:03:11.500> the<00:03:12.069> blue<00:03:12.280> color<00:03:12.579> so<00:03:13.120> the

00:03:14.039 --> 00:03:14.049 
right of iso is the blue color so the

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:18.000 
right of iso is the blue color so the
cubicle<00:03:14.530> use<00:03:14.680> is<00:03:14.889> just<00:03:15.220> plain<00:03:15.670> blue<00:03:15.909> and<00:03:16.500> I<00:03:17.500> so

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
cubicle use is just plain blue and I so

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:22.740 
cubicle use is just plain blue and I so
uses<00:03:18.639> bright<00:03:18.970> blue<00:03:21.269> you<00:03:22.269> can<00:03:22.329> see<00:03:22.629> the

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750 
uses bright blue you can see the

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:25.589 
uses bright blue you can see the
difference<00:03:23.169> here<00:03:23.370> bright<00:03:24.370> blues<00:03:24.669> well<00:03:25.419> it's

00:03:25.589 --> 00:03:25.599 
difference here bright blues well it's

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:29.400 
difference here bright blues well it's
it's<00:03:25.870> much<00:03:26.530> lighter<00:03:26.829> much<00:03:27.250> brighter<00:03:27.669> so<00:03:28.660> the

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:29.410 
it's much lighter much brighter so the

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:35.580 
it's much lighter much brighter so the
contrast<00:03:30.010> is<00:03:31.349> greater<00:03:33.419> in<00:03:34.419> the<00:03:34.480> cubicle<00:03:35.410> half

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.590 
contrast is greater in the cubicle half

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:38.640 
contrast is greater in the cubicle half
