00:00:00.529 --> 00:00:05.689
 Hello Youtube here's the Battista always 23 now we finally want it again 

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:07.810
 around 

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:10.789
 we see we are around -7 here 

00:00:10.789 --> 00:00:13.979
 for the people here all the way 

00:00:13.979 --> 00:00:17.499
 they should be extremely far away 

00:00:17.499 --> 00:00:19.409
 I have her and to 

00:00:19.409 --> 00:00:21.679
 how of the two that is 

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:23.349
 Used to Miss Sixty 

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:27.279
 the Windows Media Player icon as one of the in the taskbar 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:28.619
 of course, too 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.759
 can remove 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:33.010
 around 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:36.320
 yes solar as well as could and just try to do that so that 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.790
 does not work 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.790
 You have to do a bit of tricking around there 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.860
 For that you just need trifles Mike 9 December give time for that 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:47.500
 one up 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.500
 for Firefox especially when used in a browser 

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:54.080
 and give Google a WMP 

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:57.150
 Phew DL 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:00.390
 to dispute is from the 40 with operating system or not 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:03.390
 for this 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.180
 the GEMA 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:07.850
 Start that Kik on computer 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:11.300
 and properties 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:13.750
 that's right 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:15.770
 if now international match stands 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:18.660
 would have loaded the 32-bit the domestic 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:21.660
 Stephen on her plays and who should 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:25.250
 find this page 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.600
 Percent is between tables the description blondes the the head mobile 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.600
 32-bit version or the four blood circulation and promotes 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:34.860
 I think I think I'm for Sion 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.860
 and often go save file 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.630
 I was once downloads 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.400
 and we already have zip files 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.850
 Deubel Stephan Zippe or if rare 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.860
 have you already made a video? 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:56.120
 his partner quite simply 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:01.020
 you can see here the MP plans like point 11 of the values ​​you certify another one 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.330
 Eick but that does not matter 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:06.650
 solid copies we simply 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:08.189
 everyone on 10 

00:02:08.189 --> 00:02:09.729
 programs 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:12.209
 Llandudno the Windows Media Player 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:14.769
 the stress connected as logical as 

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:18.609
 that you put this in order that an association gets the message 

00:02:18.609 --> 00:02:21.609
 usually not that this time will prevail in here 

00:02:22.229 --> 00:02:25.229
 but usually she does not come 

00:02:26.409 --> 00:02:27.959
 ignore it now 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:29.869
 have a great idea 

00:02:29.869 --> 00:02:32.889
 Now you have to enter a small command on the area 

00:02:32.889 --> 00:02:35.399
 Percent press the windows key 

00:02:35.399 --> 00:02:38.399
 hold on and he pushes to it 

00:02:39.039 --> 00:02:42.039
 and then go this one 

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:48.159
 with quotes Suisse stands until only a description will be available 

00:02:48.159 --> 00:02:51.159
 So insert one here 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:56.769
 Copy 

00:02:59.419 --> 00:03:01.329
 Copy 

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:02.449
 and then here 

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:03.999
 insert 

00:03:03.999 --> 00:03:07.819
 in the air comes the message that l registers itself TNC 

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:13.889
 FocalPoint Windows Media Player during Peter Endpoint DLC successful 

00:03:13.889 --> 00:03:15.149
 carried out 

00:03:15.149 --> 00:03:17.279
 so could see now 

00:03:17.279 --> 00:03:20.279
 with Windows Media Player Startelf 

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:24.529
 so far it is running very important fair minimize it is not you can 

00:03:24.529 --> 00:03:27.529
 do right and are probably ice cream - more could be enough 

00:03:29.139 --> 00:03:31.549
 Son also shows that immediately 

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:34.549
 that the icons worked so well for the music recently 

00:03:37.059 --> 00:03:40.059
 and Hoffenheim the album years 

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:54.319
 change there again 

00:03:58.399 --> 00:03:59.859
 and works the thrifty
