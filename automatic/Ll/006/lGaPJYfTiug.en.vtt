00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:08.300
 yes I think that if you go all over 

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:09.740
 game looked and then we have the 

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:10.610
 most options we have 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:12.110
 I think I had it 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:13.849
 but of course but name dangerous and 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:15.499
 there are standard situations 

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:17.060
 but i think the odds are proportional 

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:18.439
 name in first self I think further 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:20.060
 there must be Foxselare 

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:21.080
 yes now you have the decision back 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:22.789
 might have to lock 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:23.990
 fall so perhaps we are 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:26.210
 we have some good good ones 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:28.580
 and if you had the options there 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:30.740
 last page just too hard or 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:32.000
 or it just isn't yes then you know 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:34.880
 that it can and can be such a competition 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.860
 ending it at 0 0 it's something 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:38.030
 daan or even that edible or even the 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:41.270
 thank you not to own this competition 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:42.740
 grows more locked than coincidence or 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:45.080
 just not that you are in that larger 

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:47.090
 matches twente ajax and not here 

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:49.070
 scores 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:51.080
 no some people can call coincidence 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:53.030
 but I don't think so 

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:54.860
 but if we are so short and natural 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:56.510
 very different weather and sure have now 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:58.280
 matches not scored and have a chance 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:59.360
 missed 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.160
 but we also have another competitions 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:02.510
 done so I don't think it's up to it 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.070
 and what is now a big one in one go 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:05.570
 competition is a not important moment 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:07.399
 in the first one too but now it's gone 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:09.079
 cassia get me what was called a 

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:11.570
 free passage to see it 

00:01:09.079 --> 00:01:12.500
 that was intense to me you also believe that 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:14.149
 of eggs 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:18.289
 because believe me seven eight feet to 

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:19.729
 right i think if they are that bundy 

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:21.140
 I'm human, even just for 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:22.729
 the goalkeeper 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.710
 yes those are very crucial moments 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:27.020
 actually in a match but good thing 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:28.520
 is the referee's decision and you have 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:29.749
 the accept is for you in the 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.219
 second half play football with 

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:33.109
 satisfied in the point of attack or 

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:34.310
 it does n't matter can play 

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:36.170
 no matter i had a bit 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.719
 yourself type types of players and strong 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:40.189
 the ball like to have a foot so 

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:42.859
 for us as boys that changes 

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:44.299
 does not change further and then I also said 

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:45.679
 against rutte yes you see then you 

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:48.380
 logical and to this week to the 

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:49.939
 in the last few weeks and in the activity 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:52.780
 this duel that you may have fought 

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:54.799
 question mark what but the second half 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:57.139
 so maybe you can call it the sun 

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:58.759
 moment that might be the case 

00:01:57.139 --> 00:02:00.380
 think for a moment okay so just too 

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:02.899
 pressure to put their ball bag 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.340
 over on to the other half, and against 

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:05.700
 then the we or sometimes the power 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:07.020
 and maybe that once in a while 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.450
 there is a lot of power among the boys 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.430
 harder urban logical and normal and 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.959
 went there or osmo 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.090
 last minute off the temporize 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:16.830
 play the ball around but I think and 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:18.180
 it and then try again 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.830
 says kenneth vermeer who is again 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:22.200
 many important players but 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:23.880
 I think he is crucial again today 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.709
 no sure you have the last week 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:28.380
 excellent 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:30.360
 he cried 0 so important of course 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:32.370
 for a tipping for the defenders 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.239
 shit what expire your own hold back 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.700
 these are of course very important 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:37.290
 moment in a in a match 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.849
 and in that he is very good at staring 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:41.819
 to one you can compliment him 

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:43.530
 But now Morocco report for TV 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:45.390
 about the difference between this competition 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:48.540
 in that of last season with you 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:49.500
 the playing method in particular is better 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.670
 I can play football for you 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.530
 soccer woman is just for you 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:54.000
 play more ball possession 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:55.709
 yes i think it is one i think 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.390
 from my ma strongest point to be with 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:58.680
 namely for precise play for living areas 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:00.420
 to play 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.799
 I love that and that's what this one is 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:03.780
 trainer would like from us from us 

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:05.220
 boys and also from backwards 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.390
 that you are not always forced to ban 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.980
 which of course is a number today 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:09.780
 happened once with vitesse very well busy 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.100
 advance a number of cultivation 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.569
 situations had also remained very calm 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.590
 and actually play it football 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:15.180
 through 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:17.549
 nevertheless two things route just as we are 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:18.930
 you don't win if you really win top 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:22.980
 this kind of duels is a painful one 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:24.630
 conclusion there is a student alike I think 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.819
 that this law would be very important will expire 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:28.079
 also to renounce actually took 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:29.940
 and from a competitor you might 

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:31.769
 the course of the seasons 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:33.000
 get closer to your own or yourself or in 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:34.350
 the neighborhood is going to get this 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.359
 moments when your team is in need 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:38.040
 get up and grab the points 

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:39.510
 If only we could do that today 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:41.609
 have failed the state in it the 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:42.720
 trainer do they equal so it is 

00:03:41.609 --> 00:03:44.459
 news leads to a basic place 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:46.650
 orange in the next week and a half over 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:49.049
 the courage to laugh right then you have to 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:50.430
 at the voucher like at this i am this church 

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:52.560
 had to go tomorrow part by to 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:53.609
 I just have to go there at the games and 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.230
 further ill how it goes 

00:03:53.609 --> 00:03:56.609
 you're not going to say how she had to play 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:58.829
 no no that certainly not me but one 

00:03:56.609 --> 00:04:00.380
 boy who we don't always take with them 

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:03.239
 luckily again lately 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:05.080
 and I do it my stinking best one 

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:06.250
 I just hope to get ten minutes 

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:08.700
 just try a west must 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:08.700
 trainings
