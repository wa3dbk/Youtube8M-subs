other videos feel free to find it if
this<00:01:21.910> is<00:01:22.090> a<00:01:22.120> difficult<00:01:22.390> thing<00:01:22.750> for<00:01:22.930> you<00:01:23.229> to<00:01:23.260> do

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:23.590 
this is a difficult thing for you to do

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:27.300 
this is a difficult thing for you to do
it's<00:01:24.550> a<00:01:24.610> lot<00:01:24.790> slower<00:01:25.060> in<00:01:25.360> other<00:01:25.510> videos<00:01:26.280> when<00:01:27.280> I

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:27.310 
it's a lot slower in other videos when I

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:30.090 
it's a lot slower in other videos when I
get<00:01:27.580> down<00:01:27.910> to<00:01:28.270> the<00:01:28.300> bottom<00:01:28.600> of<00:01:29.020> this<00:01:29.110> rope

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:30.100 
get down to the bottom of this rope

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.510 
get down to the bottom of this rope
braid<00:01:31.050> I'm<00:01:32.050> going<00:01:32.229> to<00:01:32.320> turn<00:01:32.500> it<00:01:32.710> into<00:01:32.979> what<00:01:33.490> I

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:33.520 
braid I'm going to turn it into what I

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:39.120 
braid I'm going to turn it into what I
call<00:01:33.910> a<00:01:34.180> push-up<00:01:34.540> accent<00:01:35.440> I<00:01:37.140> hold<00:01:38.140> one<00:01:38.290> of<00:01:38.860> the

holding tight and then I push it up to
the<00:01:48.280> top<00:01:48.690> and<00:01:49.690> it<00:01:49.869> creates<00:01:50.410> a<00:01:50.680> very<00:01:51.250> fun<00:01:52.140> coiled

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:53.140 
the top and it creates a very fun coiled

going<00:01:57.820> to<00:01:57.970> use<00:01:58.300> rubber<00:01:58.660> band<00:01:59.399> which<00:02:00.399> it<00:02:01.149> is

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:01.300 
going to use rubber band which it is

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:03.810 
going to use rubber band which it is
time<00:02:01.600> to<00:02:01.630> take<00:02:02.080> this<00:02:02.320> out<00:02:02.560> instead<00:02:03.369> of<00:02:03.399> pulling

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:03.820 
time to take this out instead of pulling

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:05.639
