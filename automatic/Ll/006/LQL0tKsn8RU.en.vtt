them from Australia yeah this is what
the<00:00:26.430> pain<00:00:26.610> looks<00:00:26.850> like<00:00:27.119> this<00:00:27.779> is<00:00:27.900> a<00:00:27.960> controller

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:28.350 
the pain looks like this is a controller

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:33.610 
the pain looks like this is a controller
now<00:00:29.279> when<00:00:29.609> you<00:00:29.730> get<00:00:29.880> the<00:00:30.029> tank

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:33.620 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:38.600 

this<00:00:34.620> is<00:00:34.770> everything<00:00:35.160> you<00:00:35.280> get<00:00:36.440> and<00:00:37.440> with<00:00:38.430> all

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
this is everything you get and with all

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.500 
this is everything you get and with all
that<00:00:39.140> combined<00:00:40.140> you<00:00:40.350> make<00:00:40.559> this<00:00:40.829> and<00:00:41.760> this<00:00:42.180> so

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
that combined you make this and this so

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.690 
that combined you make this and this so
they<00:00:43.410> take<00:00:43.680> about<00:00:43.800> an<00:00:44.010> hour<00:00:44.100> to<00:00:44.309> build<00:00:44.550> each

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
they take about an hour to build each

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.170 
they take about an hour to build each
they're<00:00:45.480> extremely<00:00:45.930> easy<00:00:46.230> to<00:00:46.350> build<00:00:46.559> I

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:47.180 
they're extremely easy to build I

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:48.500 
they're extremely easy to build I
recommend<00:00:48.180> them

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
recommend them

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.020 
recommend them
they<00:00:49.200> say<00:00:49.350> twelve<00:00:49.620> years<00:00:49.800> it<00:00:49.980> up<00:00:50.190> but<00:00:50.370> you

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
they say twelve years it up but you

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.000 
they say twelve years it up but you
probably<00:00:51.300> can<00:00:51.420> get<00:00:51.510> them<00:00:51.660> in<00:00:51.750> there<00:00:51.960> it's<00:00:52.920> not

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
probably can get them in there it's not

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.270 
probably can get them in there it's not

pretty<00:01:22.679> futuristic<00:01:23.099> I<00:01:23.789> haven't<00:01:24.569> put<00:01:24.660> the

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
pretty futuristic I haven't put the

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.389 
pretty futuristic I haven't put the
decals<00:01:25.080> on<00:01:25.200> I<00:01:25.440> liked<00:01:25.770> it<00:01:25.860> without<00:01:26.039> them<00:01:26.250> but

00:01:26.389 --> 00:01:26.399 
decals on I liked it without them but

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:30.680 
decals on I liked it without them but
the<00:01:26.759> hostage<00:01:28.160> do<00:01:29.160> that<00:01:29.399> then<00:01:29.819> over<00:01:30.390> here<00:01:30.420> I

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:30.690 
the hostage do that then over here I

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:38.919 
the hostage do that then over here I
don't<00:01:31.380> you<00:01:31.709> fire<00:01:31.950> to<00:01:32.310> trigger

00:01:38.919 --> 00:01:38.929 

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:42.169 

so<00:01:39.929> you<00:01:40.140> can<00:01:40.289> see<00:01:40.440> that<00:01:40.560> yellow<00:01:40.860> button<00:01:41.179> yellow

00:01:42.169 --> 00:01:42.179 
so you can see that yellow button yellow

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:45.650 
so you can see that yellow button yellow
light<00:01:42.420> in<00:01:42.690> there<00:01:43.220> that<00:01:44.220> tells<00:01:44.789> you<00:01:44.940> your<00:01:45.270> ammo

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:45.660 
light in there that tells you your ammo

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:49.180 
light in there that tells you your ammo
and<00:01:46.140> the<00:01:46.200> other<00:01:46.560> legs<00:01:47.399> tell<00:01:47.700> you<00:01:47.819> your<00:01:48.060> health

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:49.190 
and the other legs tell you your health

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:54.139 
and the other legs tell you your health
but<00:01:50.190> so<00:01:50.459> when<00:01:50.580> you<00:01:50.670> fire<00:01:52.640> it's<00:01:53.640> got<00:01:53.789> blowback

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
but so when you fire it's got blowback

00:01:54.149 --> 00:02:00.210 
but so when you fire it's got blowback
pretty<00:01:54.720> cool<00:01:55.250> and<00:01:56.250> then<00:01:56.399> turning

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:00.220 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:05.469 

yeah<00:02:01.220> pretty<00:02:01.900> it's<00:02:02.900> not<00:02:03.140> proportional<00:02:03.909> um

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479 
yeah pretty it's not proportional um

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:07.030 
yeah pretty it's not proportional um
ginger<00:02:06.020> up<00:02:06.080> the<00:02:06.200> batteries<00:02:06.470> I<00:02:06.500> mean<00:02:06.680> this<00:02:06.860> this

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:07.040 
ginger up the batteries I mean this this

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.100 
ginger up the batteries I mean this this
is<00:02:07.190> the<00:02:07.280> only<00:02:07.369> thing<00:02:07.580> that<00:02:07.700> sort<00:02:08.030> of<00:02:08.119> sucks<00:02:08.450> yes

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110 
is the only thing that sort of sucks yes

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:10.779 
is the only thing that sort of sucks yes
this<00:02:09.380> is<00:02:09.530> a<00:02:09.560> bleak<00:02:09.860> entire<00:02:10.069> thing<00:02:10.340> and<00:02:10.459> EE

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:10.789 
this is a bleak entire thing and EE

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:13.979 
this is a bleak entire thing and EE
something<00:02:11.090> the<00:02:11.180> very<00:02:11.360> blower<00:02:11.750> come<00:02:12.350> on

00:02:13.979 --> 00:02:13.989 
something the very blower come on

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:18.070 
something the very blower come on
but<00:02:14.989> yeah<00:02:15.550> it<00:02:16.550> seems<00:02:16.970> hard<00:02:17.209> it<00:02:17.450> actually<00:02:17.480> is

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080 
but yeah it seems hard it actually is

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:22.270 
but yeah it seems hard it actually is
it's<00:02:18.680> really<00:02:19.040> simple<00:02:19.280> so<00:02:20.500> I'm<00:02:21.500> going<00:02:21.890> to<00:02:22.069> get<00:02:22.250> a

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
it's really simple so I'm going to get a

00:02:22.280 --> 00:03:08.380 
it's really simple so I'm going to get a
running<00:02:22.760> video<00:02:22.910> up<00:02:23.360> right<00:02:24.350> now<00:02:34.959> so<00:03:07.390> tank

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:08.390 
running video up right now so tank

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:11.550 
running video up right now so tank
really<00:03:09.200> straightforward<00:03:09.590> as<00:03:10.310> I<00:03:10.370> said<00:03:10.730> earlier

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
really straightforward as I said earlier

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.220 
really straightforward as I said earlier
it's<00:03:12.560> designed<00:03:13.160> to<00:03:13.340> be<00:03:13.519> indoors<00:03:14.030> so<00:03:14.900> you<00:03:14.959> can

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.230 
it's designed to be indoors so you can

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:18.130 
it's designed to be indoors so you can
see<00:03:15.530> the<00:03:16.400> gears<00:03:16.670> are<00:03:17.060> super<00:03:17.630> low<00:03:17.840> to<00:03:17.900> the

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:18.140 
see the gears are super low to the

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.789 
see the gears are super low to the
ground

00:03:18.789 --> 00:03:18.799 
ground

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:20.979 
ground
they're<00:03:18.980> like<00:03:19.130> scraping<00:03:19.489> almost<00:03:20.000> and<00:03:20.510> it's

00:03:20.979 --> 00:03:20.989 
they're like scraping almost and it's

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:24.039 
they're like scraping almost and it's
got<00:03:21.110> these<00:03:21.519> like<00:03:22.519> so<00:03:22.970> the<00:03:23.090> saber<00:03:23.390> things<00:03:23.840> you

00:03:24.039 --> 00:03:24.049 
got these like so the saber things you

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:26.620 
got these like so the saber things you
can<00:03:24.170> see<00:03:24.290> those<00:03:24.500> stick<00:03:24.950> out<00:03:25.209> keep<00:03:26.209> you<00:03:26.360> from

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:26.630 
can see those stick out keep you from
