00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
I never had that before so I don't know

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.920 
I never had that before so I don't know
if<00:00:39.450> that's<00:00:39.600> a<00:00:39.690> good<00:00:39.809> or<00:00:39.870> a<00:00:40.020> bad<00:00:40.050> thing<00:00:41.809> it's<00:00:42.809> got

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
if that's a good or a bad thing it's got

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.529 
if that's a good or a bad thing it's got
a<00:00:42.960> bolt-on<00:00:43.320> neck<00:00:43.579> so<00:00:44.579> it<00:00:44.910> would<00:00:45.059> be<00:00:45.180> easy<00:00:45.329> to

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
a bolt-on neck so it would be easy to

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:50.560 
a bolt-on neck so it would be easy to
change<00:00:45.780> hopefully<00:00:46.410> not<00:00:46.829> easier<00:00:47.250> to<00:00:47.340> warp<00:00:48.860> via

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:50.570 
change hopefully not easier to warp via

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:54.500 
change hopefully not easier to warp via
two<00:00:51.570> knobs<00:00:51.780> and<00:00:52.230> then<00:00:52.559> the<00:00:53.090> pickup<00:00:54.090> switch<00:00:54.210> or

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
two knobs and then the pickup switch or

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.430 
two knobs and then the pickup switch or
3-way<00:00:54.960> switch<00:00:56.480> and<00:00:57.480> it<00:00:57.629> sounds<00:00:57.989> really<00:00:58.230> good

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
3-way switch and it sounds really good

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:30.850 
3-way switch and it sounds really good
