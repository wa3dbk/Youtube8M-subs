talks<00:01:45.329> about<00:01:45.570> it<00:01:45.689> all<00:01:45.840> the<00:01:45.899> time<00:01:46.200> on<00:01:46.649> CNBC<00:01:47.460> uh

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
talks about it all the time on CNBC uh

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.850 
talks about it all the time on CNBC uh
so<00:01:48.450> somewhat<00:01:48.930> argued<00:01:49.200> this<00:01:49.320> was<00:01:49.500> gonna<00:01:49.560> have

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
so somewhat argued this was gonna have

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.830 
so somewhat argued this was gonna have
to<00:01:49.890> happen<00:01:50.130> regardless<00:01:50.850> and<00:01:51.329> they<00:01:51.509> keep<00:01:51.659> on

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
to happen regardless and they keep on

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.389 
to happen regardless and they keep on
bringing<00:01:51.960> out<00:01:52.200> different<00:01:52.680> property<00:01:53.100> curbs

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
bringing out different property curbs

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:54.980 
bringing out different property curbs
and<00:01:53.610> my<00:01:53.700> question<00:01:53.759> is<00:01:54.149> yes<00:01:54.360> over<00:01:54.810> and<00:01:54.930> over

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
and my question is yes over and over

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.600 
and my question is yes over and over
over<00:01:55.200> and<00:01:55.439> over<00:01:55.560> and<00:01:55.740> over<00:01:55.770> again<00:01:55.950> and<00:01:56.100> is<00:01:56.430> it

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
over and over and over again and is it

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.340 
over and over and over again and is it
because<00:01:56.939> the<00:01:57.360> original<00:01:57.450> wants<00:01:57.869> to<00:01:57.990> stop<00:01:58.140> being

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
because the original wants to stop being

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:59.990 
because the original wants to stop being
enforced<00:01:58.680> prop<00:01:59.009> it's<00:01:59.219> because<00:01:59.490> people<00:01:59.520> have

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
enforced prop it's because people have

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.880 
enforced prop it's because people have
no<00:02:00.270> choice<00:02:00.570> it's<00:02:01.259> like<00:02:01.439> Dutch<00:02:01.649> disease

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
no choice it's like Dutch disease

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.679 
no choice it's like Dutch disease
suddenly<00:02:02.670> you<00:02:02.820> have<00:02:02.939> a<00:02:02.969> population<00:02:03.210> with<00:02:03.659> a

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
suddenly you have a population with a

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.420 
suddenly you have a population with a
lot<00:02:03.899> more<00:02:03.930> money<00:02:04.200> but<00:02:04.710> the<00:02:04.829> stock<00:02:05.070> market<00:02:05.399> is

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
lot more money but the stock market is

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.270 
lot more money but the stock market is
too<00:02:05.700> small<00:02:06.000> too<00:02:06.329> risky<00:02:06.780> to<00:02:06.810> rigged<00:02:07.350> the<00:02:08.009> only

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
too small too risky to rigged the only

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.609 
too small too risky to rigged the only
choice<00:02:08.520> really<00:02:09.000> is<00:02:09.209> property<00:02:10.140> and<00:02:10.379> so<00:02:10.470> people

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
choice really is property and so people

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.680 
choice really is property and so people
buy<00:02:10.890> two<00:02:10.950> three<00:02:11.670> four<00:02:12.060> homes

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
buy two three four homes

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.000 
buy two three four homes
because<00:02:12.840> they're<00:02:12.990> desperate<00:02:13.500> to<00:02:13.530> put<00:02:13.860> their

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:15.960 
assets someplace that's what happens

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.140

urban city markets but I don't think

this<00:02:37.470> is<00:02:37.530> a<00:02:37.680> story<00:02:38.190> in<00:02:38.720> 2013<00:02:39.720> that<00:02:40.050> it's<00:02:40.260> really

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
this is a story in 2013 that it's really

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.590 
this is a story in 2013 that it's really
going<00:02:40.620> to<00:02:40.710> bite<00:02:40.950> think<00:02:41.640> what<00:02:42.120> we're<00:02:42.240> talking

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
going to bite think what we're talking

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.510 
going to bite think what we're talking
about<00:02:42.660> is<00:02:42.870> a<00:02:42.900> government<00:02:43.140> that<00:02:43.710> actually<00:02:44.280> on

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:44.520 
about is a government that actually on

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:47.090 
about is a government that actually on
the<00:02:45.000> positive<00:02:45.180> side<00:02:45.710> understands<00:02:46.710> that<00:02:46.920> they

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
the positive side understands that they

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:48.650 
the positive side understands that they
have<00:02:47.310> some<00:02:47.610> structural<00:02:48.000> imbalances

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
have some structural imbalances

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:50.510 
have some structural imbalances
regarding<00:02:49.260> investment<00:02:49.860> and<00:02:50.040> speculative

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:50.520 
regarding investment and speculative

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.700 
regarding investment and speculative
investment<00:02:51.090> in<00:02:51.180> residential<00:02:51.960> properties<00:02:52.530> and

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:52.710 
investment in residential properties and

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:55.460 
investment in residential properties and
since<00:02:53.340> 2010<00:02:54.150> has<00:02:54.510> really<00:02:54.810> been<00:02:54.960> much<00:02:55.200> more

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
since 2010 has really been much more

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.650 
since 2010 has really been much more
aggressive<00:02:56.010> in<00:02:56.070> trying<00:02:56.310> to<00:02:56.520> control<00:02:57.060> that<00:02:57.300> so

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
aggressive in trying to control that so

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.260 
aggressive in trying to control that so
they've<00:02:58.320> got<00:02:58.350> levers<00:02:58.920> at<00:02:59.190> their<00:02:59.370> disposal<00:02:59.610> and

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:00.270 
they've got levers at their disposal and

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:01.700 
they've got levers at their disposal and
I<00:03:00.450> think<00:03:00.690> we're<00:03:00.840> in<00:03:00.960> an<00:03:01.080> environment<00:03:01.170> now

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:01.710 
I think we're in an environment now

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:03.530 
I think we're in an environment now
where<00:03:02.040> structurally<00:03:02.580> the<00:03:03.000> government<00:03:03.480> is

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
where structurally the government is

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.240 
where structurally the government is
really<00:03:03.750> trying<00:03:03.960> to<00:03:03.990> get<00:03:04.110> more<00:03:04.290> involved<00:03:04.560> to

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
really trying to get more involved to

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:07.310 
really trying to get more involved to
slow<00:03:05.490> down<00:03:05.640> speculative<00:03:06.210> activity<00:03:06.330> and<00:03:06.960> all

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:07.320 
slow down speculative activity and all

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.950 
slow down speculative activity and all
indications<00:03:07.500> are<00:03:08.010> that<00:03:08.070> since<00:03:08.460> 2010<00:03:09.270> they've

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:09.960 
indications are that since 2010 they've

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:11.810 
indications are that since 2010 they've
actually<00:03:10.200> had<00:03:10.380> a<00:03:10.530> lot<00:03:10.710> of<00:03:10.740> success<00:03:11.250> there<00:03:11.550> so

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:11.820 
actually had a lot of success there so

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:13.940

well<00:04:56.790> here's<00:04:57.000> the<00:04:57.120> key<00:04:57.300> point<00:04:57.570> it's<00:04:57.810> it's<00:04:58.050> a

00:04:58.160 --> 00:04:58.170 
well here's the key point it's it's a

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:00.110 
well here's the key point it's it's a
question<00:04:58.530> of<00:04:58.620> policy<00:04:58.830> capacity<00:04:59.760> and<00:05:00.000> the

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:00.120 
question of policy capacity and the

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:01.610 
question of policy capacity and the
government's<00:05:00.510> bandwidth<00:05:00.900> and<00:05:01.140> the<00:05:01.380> reality

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:01.620 
government's bandwidth and the reality

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:03.290 
government's bandwidth and the reality
is<00:05:01.860> yes<00:05:02.100> they<00:05:02.310> have<00:05:02.430> a<00:05:02.460> lot<00:05:02.670> of<00:05:02.700> cash<00:05:02.970> at<00:05:03.180> their

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:03.300 
is yes they have a lot of cash at their

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:05.600 
is yes they have a lot of cash at their
disposal<00:05:03.510> if<00:05:03.960> this<00:05:04.530> ultimately<00:05:04.980> results<00:05:05.460> in<00:05:05.520> a

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:05.610 
disposal if this ultimately results in a

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:07.460 
disposal if this ultimately results in a
real<00:05:05.760> financial<00:05:06.030> problem<00:05:06.630> it'll<00:05:06.870> it<00:05:07.200> won't<00:05:07.380> be

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:07.470 
real financial problem it'll it won't be

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:08.990 
real financial problem it'll it won't be
a<00:05:07.500> financial<00:05:07.710> problem<00:05:08.100> it'll<00:05:08.400> be<00:05:08.520> a<00:05:08.550> fiscal

problem and Beijing right now is very

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:13.220 
problem and Beijing right now is very
solvent<00:05:11.430> and<00:05:11.550> capable<00:05:12.030> of<00:05:12.240> absorbing<00:05:12.630> that<00:05:12.900> so

Nick no I think you know there's no

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:44.300 
Nick no I think you know there's no
question<00:05:43.290> that<00:05:43.320> there<00:05:43.590> is<00:05:43.680> a<00:05:43.710> medium<00:05:44.100> term

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:44.310 
question that there is a medium term

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:45.890 
question that there is a medium term
risk<00:05:44.580> here<00:05:44.880> and<00:05:45.090> it's<00:05:45.300> related<00:05:45.450> to<00:05:45.720> this

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:45.900 
risk here and it's related to this

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:48.380 
risk here and it's related to this
bigger<00:05:46.140> picture<00:05:46.590> of<00:05:46.620> reform<00:05:47.370> to<00:05:48.360> the

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:48.390 
bigger picture of reform to the

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:49.850 
bigger picture of reform to the
financial<00:05:48.930> system<00:05:49.110> in<00:05:49.350> the<00:05:49.440> way<00:05:49.560> that<00:05:49.770> it

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:49.860 
financial system in the way that it

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:52.010 
financial system in the way that it
operates<00:05:50.010> in<00:05:50.430> China<00:05:50.700> today<00:05:50.940> but<00:05:51.630> I<00:05:51.660> just<00:05:51.930> see

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:52.020 
operates in China today but I just see

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:53.570 
operates in China today but I just see
no<00:05:52.200> real<00:05:52.380> compelling<00:05:52.890> reason<00:05:53.250> to<00:05:53.280> believe

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:53.580 
no real compelling reason to believe

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:56.030 
no real compelling reason to believe
that<00:05:53.760> in<00:05:54.169> 2013<00:05:55.169> there's<00:05:55.440> some<00:05:55.620> structural

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:56.040 
that in 2013 there's some structural

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:57.950 
that in 2013 there's some structural
driver<00:05:56.460> that<00:05:57.120> is<00:05:57.270> fundamentally<00:05:57.930> different

00:05:57.950 --> 00:05:57.960 
driver that is fundamentally different

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:00.080 
driver that is fundamentally different
in<00:05:58.590> terms<00:05:58.830> of<00:05:59.010> what<00:05:59.160> has<00:05:59.250> changed<00:05:59.669> in<00:05:59.790> terms<00:05:59.910> of

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:00.090 
in terms of what has changed in terms of

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:01.550 
in terms of what has changed in terms of
the<00:06:00.180> drivers<00:06:00.720> of<00:06:00.870> growth<00:06:00.900> in<00:06:01.290> China

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:01.560 
the drivers of growth in China

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:03.590 
the drivers of growth in China
domestically<00:06:02.220> and<00:06:02.400> internationally<00:06:02.600> so

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:03.600 
domestically and internationally so

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:05.420 
domestically and internationally so
until<00:06:04.350> we<00:06:04.500> are<00:06:04.530> in<00:06:04.680> environment<00:06:05.280> where<00:06:05.400> I

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:05.430 
until we are in environment where I

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:06.800 
until we are in environment where I
think<00:06:05.640> the<00:06:05.729> government<00:06:06.060> is<00:06:06.180> interested<00:06:06.510> in

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:06.810 
think the government is interested in

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:09.830 
think the government is interested in
materially<00:06:07.470> changing<00:06:08.250> that<00:06:08.400> basic<00:06:09.270> reality

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:09.840 
materially changing that basic reality

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:11.900 
materially changing that basic reality
then<00:06:10.410> I'm<00:06:10.560> just<00:06:10.860> not<00:06:10.979> as<00:06:11.130> concerned<00:06:11.490> about<00:06:11.610> the

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:11.910 
then I'm just not as concerned about the

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:14.120 
then I'm just not as concerned about the
risk<00:06:12.360> being<00:06:12.630> particularly<00:06:13.200> acute<00:06:13.530> right<00:06:13.860> now

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:14.130 
risk being particularly acute right now

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:16.159 
risk being particularly acute right now
