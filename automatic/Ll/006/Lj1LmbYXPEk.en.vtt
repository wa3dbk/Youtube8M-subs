00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:09.960
 it's time to make a comparison 

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:11.700
 controversial 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.950
 Let's put two of the smartest 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.929
 desired and carlos of the moment side to 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.480
 side and see who does the best 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.970
 on one end we have the iphone 6 plus 64 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.330
 gigabytes and in the other the galaxy s 6 is 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.189
 64 gigabytes what do they have in common 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:27.900
 identical and unfriendly prices of 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.269
 four thousand two hundred ninety nine 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.439
 and who offers the best cost 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.830
 benefit with this price 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.830
 let's see now 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.620
 this is one of the first comparatives that 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.360
 we do in which samsung can 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.219
 compete on an equal footing with apple 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.700
 in relation to the quality of construction 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.750
 the galaxy s 6 is day as well as the s6 freight 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:50.700
 finally abandoned plastic to 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.079
 general joy of users in favor of 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.980
 a glass design with doors 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.719
 aluminum 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.129
 apple never had major problems in 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.140
 relation to the quality of their 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.570
 rotating design every two years until 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.180
 to get to the iphone 6 plus bigger device 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.920
 of the company released until then quality 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.210
 it's not a problem either 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.430
 choose the best design based 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.049
 seems to us wrong already 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.479
 that both stand out in this matter of 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:15.020
 different way then let's point out the 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.020
 two here 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:22.259
 the exclusive iphone screen really is 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:25.470
 chin-drop are 5.5 inches and 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:27.869
 resolution of 1,920 by 1,080 with lcd 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.729
 high quality and vibrant color is 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.920
 It's difficult to find a problem here. 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:34.409
 however it is also difficult to keep the 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.240
 galaxy samsung d 6 showed that there 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.729
 of best in its super-amoled technology 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.790
 here with a resolution almost twice 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:44.280
 higher infinite contrast ratio and colors 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.750
 pretty vivid screen specs 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.939
 do not say much at least in 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.229
 most situations, but simply put 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:53.540
 both side by side to see the 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.540
 superiority of galaxy s 67 screen 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:02.970
 the fight between former No. 74 22 6 is against 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:05.100
 apple to eight of iphone 6 plus octa 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:07.530
 core with 3 GB of RAM against the 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.360
 dual core with 1 gigabyte of ram 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.490
 in general when comparing iphone with 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.500
 android count and optimizations are 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:15.360
 much and leveraged the score for the 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.250
 side of apple but neither did it save the 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.560
 iphone cases 6 brutality prussak 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:21.959
 galaxy s 6 edge processing in 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.570
 our benchmark s6 is point or nothing 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:25.140
 less than 50% more than the iphone 6 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:28.260
 plus 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:30.330
 besides bringing a 25% faster gpu 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.070
 remembering that it is the same programs and 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.750
 that the only 6 is to have a screen resolution 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:35.400
 considerably higher than what is 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.080
 prevented it from punctuating more 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.000
 many will argue that it is unfair 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.340
 compare an eight-core chip against 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.080
 another of only 2 an appliance with 3 gb 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.120
 from ram memory to another that has 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:46.739
 only 1 gigabyte but we are 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.260
 comparing is actually a smartphone 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:51.600
 against the other and even test and feel 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:59.400
 say is by fans the iphone 6 cross lost 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:03:01.709
 here then galaxy s point 6 ad by 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.540
 some reason the iphone 6 plus kept the 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:04.830
 8 megapixels that apple has used 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.810
 has been some time 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:08.310
 It's okay, we have a better sensor and photos. 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:10.500
 with excellent quality in practically 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:12.420
 any condition but so little far from 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:15.450
 offer the same camera results 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:17.370
 of 16 megapixels of the galaxy s 6 ad as 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:19.290
 we did in our analysis of it to samsung 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:21.390
 amazingly well in that 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:22.830
 Question bringing even pro so 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:23.880
 gives access to a good amount of 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:25.709
 extra functions 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:28.830
 many of them not present on the iphone 6 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:30.209
 plus and the front camera with the iphone 6 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:32.880
 plus comes with a 1.3 camera 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:34.500
 megapixels that shoots at 720p 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:36.660
 while the galaxy s six edis comes with 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:39.390
 a 5 megapixel camera that records video 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:41.459
 a resolution four times larger and yes 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:43.290
 with more quality in both cases 

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:45.180
 we then have one more point than the galaxy s 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:50.730
 67 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:53.099
 the difficult thing here since we are 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:55.950
 comparing apples with samsung 

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:59.519
 both bring 4g nfc enabled 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:01.680
 gps bluetooth gps payment to be anyway 

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:03.599
 one giant list always by 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:05.010
 first time samsung does not even come out 

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:07.019
 the front because she failed to bring 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:09.000
 support for micro sd cards 

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:10.709
 s6 is to come out ahead with endure 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.209
 wireless sensor charging 

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:14.340
 infrared and heart rate 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:15.329
 while the iphone 6 plus does not come with 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:17.160
 none of this 

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:19.889
 if it were only one or two questions to 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:22.049
 we would consider the tie but three 

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:30.449
 it is too much more then a point that the 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:32.699
 galaxy s 6 ad many have opted for the iphone 

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:33.990
 6 plus instead of iphone 6 in particular 

00:04:32.699 --> 00:04:36.990
 by the larger battery 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:39.449
 it comes with 2,915 milliamperes capacity 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:40.860
 against the 2600 he skin of ability 

00:04:39.449 --> 00:04:42.780
 from the galaxy 's headquarters 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:44.400
 this small difference has already resulted in 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:45.810
 a few more hours of use if 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:48.389
 we were talking about the same system 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:49.949
 with the same hardware but the 

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:51.810
 apple gets ahead for the sake of 

00:04:49.949 --> 00:04:54.150
 more autonomy for the same capacity 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:55.530
 anyway this means that the 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:57.270
 iphone 6 pounds can stay longer 

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:59.550
 time out of the wall outlet offering a 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:01.409
 experience of the West while the 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:03.060
 galaxy s 67 needs a way of 

00:05:01.409 --> 00:05:05.550
 emergency to complete the day in 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:08.150
 many situations then point for iphone 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:08.150
 6 cross 

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:15.510
 after years using both systems 

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:17.310
 we have to be sincere we have 

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:19.590
 comparing two tablets to apple would come out 

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:21.870
 on the front since the ipad s still beats 

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:23.730
 android tablet by a good margin 

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:25.590
 however android has evolved faster than 

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:27.840
 that s in recent years considering 

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:29.370
 only individual smartphones and 

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:31.620
 integration of platforms that 

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:33.630
 apple for iphone and other products 

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:35.280
 of company like mac to apple tv 

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:38.250
 Both in quality as in quantity 

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:40.830
 apps 2 special impact due to 

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:42.090
 launch of android 5.0 lippok as 

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:48.960
 none of the platforms leaves the user 

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:50.400
 on hand we give points for the 2 cost 

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:51.810
 benefit is a strange expression 

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:53.910
 When we're talking about four thousand 

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:55.410
 three hundred reais for a smartphone, right? 

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:57.180
 The truth is that neither apple nor 

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:58.170
 samsung called a lot for this is put 

00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:00.120
 these prices 

00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:02.070
 the iphone in Brazil for some reason that 

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:04.110
 Until today we do not always understand 

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:05.280
 that time of luxury status that makes 

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:07.260
 with which many users buy a 

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:08.970
 iphone without connecting so much that the price to 

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:10.560
 samsung tries to achieve this position already 

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:12.870
 some time so far without success 

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:14.670
 worth saying because the two 

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:16.230
 companies want with these two devices 

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:18.690
 is to sell the idea that you are 

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:20.640
 paying for the status not for the product and 

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:22.800
 For us, this is just an excuse for 

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:24.690
 put the price of the galaxy s 6 eddie 

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:26.940
 iphone 6 plus up there 

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:28.680
 are unrealistic prices in both cases what 

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:29.280
 independent of the resources offered by 

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:36.120
 two 

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:38.490
 then no one told here then we have the 

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:40.410
 final score of 6 points of the galaxy s 67 

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:42.120
 against three points of iphone 6 plus 

00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:44.580
 showing that Samsung made an excellent 

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:46.620
 work this time the truth is that even 

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:48.660
 which was a score of 6 to 0 

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:50.130
 many still prefer an iphone since 

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:51.750
 he comes with that little hand in the 

00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:52.620
 and the same is valid for the 

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:54.000
 samsung 

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:56.220
 this score shows only that the 

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.230
 galaxy s 6 is a better device with 

00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:59.460
 many quotes here considered 

00:06:58.230 --> 00:07:01.410
 individually 

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:02.940
 it offers better specifications but 

00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:04.200
 that means little to whom 

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:05.850
 like s 

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:07.770
 if you liked it short here below and so 

00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:10.550
