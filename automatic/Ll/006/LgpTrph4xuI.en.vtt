00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:05.490
 hello to all and daisy I find you 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:08.189
 this week for the opening of the 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.650
 boxed auc six finally I could not find 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.330
 not until today and I have 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.940
 finally got it in a shop 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.320
 of toys so I think so far it 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.880
 is remembered everywhere in the 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.880
 toy store and probably 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:23.760
 supermarket too so this box that 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.410
 contains three boosters booster 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.710
 plasma glaciation and a time not of 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:31.800
 plasma there are also boxes of auc 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:34.200
 six with plasma glaciation but also 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.920
 an obscure explorer in the place of the 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.690
 time no plasma a map 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.780
 promotional in the graphic drakkar 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.430
 hand so I do not know if the bdew 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:48.210
 how much will we see by opening the 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:52.289
 casket is a handsome young auc six 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:54.449
 ex in the size of the size card 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.699
 normal that can be found in 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.440
 the extension of the plasma station so the 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.960
 last extension 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.719
 so here is so nice box I do not know 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:07.140
 you if you go you can see at 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:09.500
 about the back of the cabinet with the 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.580
 plasma team badge 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.260
 I will not read you what marked 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.650
 you can break if you want 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:20.340
 to know a little more and I will not 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:22.950
 wait longer then until 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.979
 now I have no luck at all 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:30.150
 so but previous openness 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:30.570
 especially the pokÃ© box and and the duets 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.000
 Easter 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:37.200
 so I wish it changed a 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.570
 little i hope for for this cave 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:43.229
 Well, we'll see three 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:48.570
 boosters so go hop hard I'm 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:51.100
 not cheat a king scalp and 1d oxis the 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:57.299
 young handsome card 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:02:00.369
 of the six ex is nice jumbo gap 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:02.909
 and I'm going to put a family in 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:07.570
 master of ceremonies for this opening 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:10.569
 and the promotional card that I'm going 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:16.319
 try to go out without dressing it up 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:23.110
 obvious in the plastic up drakkar ma 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:24.819
 holographic so the bdew 80 so good 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.610
 train because tomorrow I do not understand too much 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:30.519
 why did they put a carmine sheet in 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:32.680
 a box docsis it seemed to me that at 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:34.600
 the base they allow a figurine 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:38.069
 deoxys who would have been nicer finally 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:41.110
 it's a new promo up 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:43.319
 so I will not make you wait 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:46.810
 longer for for opening 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:48.519
 men so here I am going to start with 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:59.820
 the plasma storm and keep the most 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:59.820
 recent for then codling 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:18.590
 so a tic riou him is neither organic each 

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:24.060
 ripping ouisticram a goal is 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:28.800
 melancholy this and tanguay tic in river 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:30.570
 a max so it's a rare he pours there 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:33.840
 has one by nothing of water I believe I 

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:40.739
 do not know which is no rivers and 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:57.360
 in rar to holographic galam two 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:04:05.640
 pokemon if booster this case the cold and 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:09.420
 all handed quite ratatat tadmor nor 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:14.070
 of oran nor of female oran and seems to me 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:17.549
 patch of the team plasma crooks co and and 

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:22.200
 flight ride for life in river 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:26.060
 sarata taxes and a rivers and the rare 

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:31.950
 a xylographic trio that I already had 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:35.280
 in one of my boxes and last booster 

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:38.720
 his suitcase it makes small videos 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:38.720
 just 3 just before 

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:58.560
 quite at this pico evolved arco 

00:04:52.699 --> 00:05:01.860
 axolotl at worst in bed north fang and 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:07.199
 only at comfort to the rivers 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:09.080
 gold an aspect digging of life so the 

00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:13.580
 video in English had frozen in English 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:15.510
 and in rar a docking nest so good no 

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:17.250
 it could have been worse 10 have up 

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:19.949
 now where I really did not have any 

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:22.169
 luck i'm going to settle for it 

00:05:19.949 --> 00:05:25.050
 even so of that so two holographic 

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:26.669
 still it's not that bad 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:28.500
 be our two graphic heroes here they are 

00:05:26.669 --> 00:05:29.910
 in two holographic galam yet 

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:34.500
 no plasma and tower trioxides 

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:36.990
 thanks to its plasma we have two rivers that 

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:37.710
 are river rats so it's rather 

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:42.090
 as well 

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:43.199
 and then and then a high-tech so in 

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:45.510
 french thursday at spec 

00:05:43.199 --> 00:05:48.660
 I usually say in English but 

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:50.610
 high tech so in France is there then the 

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:53.639
 changes if there are some of them 

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:54.030
 you who are looking for high news 

00:05:53.639 --> 00:05:55.889
 tech 

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:58.650
 there are two in the pink extension and 

00:05:55.889 --> 00:06:02.310
 quote and crac guen I do not know it's 

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:04.200
 what's the name the name in french so bowl 

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:05.880
 I'm not I'm not unhappy euros 

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:08.099
 I hope that if the mach years comes back 

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:11.190
 little by little it should go 

00:06:08.099 --> 00:06:14.460
 we will see for the following videos but 

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:17.190
 I think it's better than 

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:19.770
 previous opening so here's so 

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:23.130
 thank you no family who suddenly the door to 

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:24.900
 a little luck I hope that he will do 

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:27.630
 better next time she tell me 

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:29.699

00:06:31.949 --> 00:06:38.669

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:41.220
 than what I opened up 

00:06:38.669 --> 00:06:44.010

 idea of 

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:49.879
