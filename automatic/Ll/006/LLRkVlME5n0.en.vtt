00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:36.010
 hi friends from youtube i am le diese 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:38.020
 again like this video tutorial like 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:41.980
 you have already read the title of this video 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:45.400
 it's about how to drop the menu 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:47.290
 start of windows looks to the classic menu 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:49.200
 from windows xp 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:52.270
 this is one for people who 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.940
 they miss the operating system xp in 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:58.120
 those times that we use xp and 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:01:00.190
 because this application windows are 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:02.350
 it's not for windows and also for 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:04.869
 windows view of how to put the menu 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:07.000
 classic start of the municipality at 

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:09.700
 people who want is a software of 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.990
 no more appearance but it also serves 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.200
 a lot since if we can also 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:16.649
 to locate 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:20.630
 the documents in the way of xp as 

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:23.399
 we did it as we see here we have the 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:26.039
 start term of xp as it used to be 

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:28.950
 before and after this way as well as 

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:31.380
 the search area we see and so we go 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:36.719
 to put in this operating system that is 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:39.329
 10 for 32-bit and 64-bit versions 

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:41.429
 bits the links will be in more 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:43.439
 information in this video is not 

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:46.619
 worry for the wii versions do not 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:48.599
 they look from the 64-bit god as you 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:52.070
 good once downloaded the document 

00:01:48.599 --> 00:01:55.100
 winrar we give you to extract here 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:59.210
 as you see here until the 72nd meet the call 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:01.130
 64 bit in the case of 64 bits it 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:03.640
 would extend here we will leave a 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.640
 binder 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:09.350
 good although there are extracted we will leave 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:11.600
 that folder that opened a folder and we 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:14.370
 will come out this 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:17.819
 that these files 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:20.510
 other files and then the application will 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:23.430
 flame classic windows starter often 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:25.890
 to execute it we double click on 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:29.730
 this icon in the cav from minutes of 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:31.460
 gold of the beginning we give double click 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:35.410
 and charge 

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:40.310
 and as we see here we start this we see 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:42.710
 how is the menu turned to have very 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:45.590
 different as the search will take the 

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:50.900
 search for windows xp so we have it 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:52.700
 now and good as you see here has in this 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:56.590
 minute we already have a fund type of 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:59.860
 green and orange pomegranate 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:03.730
 I do not like it much in my case 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:04.810
 to configure the colors for 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:07.960
 those who want to have a better 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:10.600
 appearance in the type of menu what 

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:14.770
 we have to do is give right click him 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:18.070
 we give options and since we will leave this 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:20.350
 menu to configure in all kinds be 

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:22.480
 as size of the icons the issste 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:24.070
 appearance see pandele control of 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:27.280
 manage with your limited good 

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:31.570
 original I give the popcorn to all 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:35.170
 and here to show background to each contest 

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:37.480
 degraded funds afterwards so that it does not 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:39.040
 see in all that gradient if you want 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:41.500
 declared loans of the two colors 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:44.920
 but me in my case that whatever a 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:47.720
 little more patience marks in 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:50.400
 capacity the fund does not give zero 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:53.549
 and we give you to accept 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:56.000
 as we see it has a better appearance 

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:58.760
 plas 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:02.480
 the truth is that it is very good and I like it 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:05.770
 enough that some will think not 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:08.860
 note as much as in the black backgrounds 

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:12.800
 the menu letters are not so noticeable 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:16.100
 for this we give again and right 

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:17.540
 options in text color we give you a 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:21.380
 brief intense 

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:25.420
 we give him to accept and as we see 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:28.500
 is more reflected 

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:32.380
 the texts we can see it more easily 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:34.320
 and so find the two currency menus more 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:36.150
 fast 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:38.970
 so we are going to configure the 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:41.460
 options and this software for me 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:43.080
 I like it a lot because even though it 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:46.290
 puts the classic start menu of 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:48.060
 windows xp also gives you the options of 

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:51.330
 configure be colored 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:53.040
 if you are of icons and all that for 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:54.650
 cooperate and nurture me of a better 

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:57.870
 appearance 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:05:00.180
 as we see here we have everything here in 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:01.830
 appearance I recommend des palomi a 

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:04.200
 this option because if we lead these 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:07.830
 all are put in a single color as well as 

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:10.540
 the color of this advantage and it is not very 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:14.070
 good appearance 

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:14.070
 can we be divine 

00:05:14.449 --> 00:05:21.340
 as we see in the software is called 

00:05:17.029 --> 00:05:21.340
 classic is version 3.1 

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:26.370
 obviously not what I found a 

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:29.370
 page and I recommend that you relax in 

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:32.240
 this page those who miss the 

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:35.380
 windows xp menu 

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:35.380
 I hope you enjoyed 

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:41.009
 is this application I like 

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:42.990
 I quite do this video for the 

00:05:41.009 --> 00:05:46.080
 people who want this kind of media 

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:49.860
 and good is another thing as we see here 

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:52.110
 in the menu does not come out windows 7 is the 

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:54.449
 last explained to tourists tired of the 

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:58.199
 Summer is this title to change that 

00:05:54.449 --> 00:06:00.030
 title in the options here where 

00:05:58.199 --> 00:06:01.949
 detected the strip we can put the 

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:04.440
 whatever name I want, I'll name it 

00:06:01.949 --> 00:06:07.590
 of youtube user 

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:09.750
 we must accept and we see that here we 

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:11.840
 they appear changes the text and tells us 

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:15.710
 the 10 

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:20.230
 and another very interesting thing about these 

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:20.230
 options on destination 

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:27.990
 to exit that application finally 

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:29.280
 We give the right spli and exit the 

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:32.960
 program output we have to 

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:37.169
 finally item we stumble to the menu 

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:40.090
 I finish normal of 10 my problem 

00:06:37.169 --> 00:06:42.100
 easy education 

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:44.729
 a very easy video but of a software 

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:47.219
 very interesting 

00:06:44.729 --> 00:06:49.319
