00:03:36.039 --> 00:03:36.049 
God inspired a book and then didn't or

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:39.340 
God inspired a book and then didn't or
couldn't<00:03:36.400> preserve<00:03:37.400> it<00:03:37.780> inspiration<00:03:38.780> without

couldn't preserve it inspiration without

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:41.350 
couldn't preserve it inspiration without
preservation<00:03:40.190> is<00:03:40.340> a<00:03:40.370> divine<00:03:40.670> waste<00:03:40.910> of<00:03:41.090> time

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:41.360
