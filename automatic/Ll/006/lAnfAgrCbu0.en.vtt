you also have some compression options

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.349 
you also have some compression options
here<00:01:01.770> now<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.579> higher<00:01:02.789> you<00:01:03.030> have<00:01:03.180> your

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
here now the higher you have your

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
compression the more CPU power is going

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.640 
compression the more CPU power is going
to<00:01:05.610> take<00:01:05.820> up<00:01:06.030> how<00:01:06.510> much<00:01:06.720> this<00:01:06.930> will<00:01:07.170> use<00:01:07.380> I<00:01:07.590> do

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
to take up how much this will use I do

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.830 
to take up how much this will use I do
not<00:01:07.920> know<00:01:08.100> but<00:01:08.280> if<00:01:08.400> you<00:01:08.520> have<00:01:08.760> a<00:01:09.000> low<00:01:09.600> power

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
not know but if you have a low power

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.359 
not know but if you have a low power
computer<00:01:10.350> it's<00:01:10.500> probably<00:01:10.830> a<00:01:10.860> good<00:01:11.010> idea<00:01:11.070> to

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
computer it's probably a good idea to

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.670 
computer it's probably a good idea to
keep<00:01:11.610> the<00:01:11.670> compression<00:01:12.090> on<00:01:12.479> low<00:01:12.750> now<00:01:13.470> down

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
keep the compression on low now down

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.890 
keep the compression on low now down

have<00:01:31.530> it<00:01:31.680> enabled<00:01:32.310> all<00:01:32.490> the<00:01:32.610> time<00:01:32.820> which<00:01:33.030> means

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
have it enabled all the time which means

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.819 
have it enabled all the time which means
you<00:01:33.479> can<00:01:33.630> be<00:01:33.750> playing<00:01:33.990> you're<00:01:34.500> not<00:01:34.530> even

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
you can be playing you're not even

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.289 
you can be playing you're not even
streaming<00:01:35.159> someone's<00:01:35.640> in<00:01:35.759> your<00:01:35.790> twitch.tv

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
streaming someone's in your twitch.tv

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:37.760 
streaming someone's in your twitch.tv
chat<00:01:36.869> and<00:01:37.020> they<00:01:37.079> can<00:01:37.259> send<00:01:37.470> you<00:01:37.530> a<00:01:37.590> message

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
chat and they can send you a message

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.800 
chat and they can send you a message
in-game<00:01:38.250> which<00:01:38.520> is<00:01:38.700> a<00:01:38.729> very<00:01:39.390> interesting

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
in-game which is a very interesting

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.020 
in-game which is a very interesting
feature<00:01:40.200> and<00:01:40.650> last<00:01:41.130> of<00:01:41.340> all<00:01:41.430> down<00:01:41.640> here<00:01:41.909> we

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
feature and last of all down here we

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.940 
feature and last of all down here we
have<00:01:42.210> the<00:01:42.360> broadcast<00:01:42.840> server<00:01:43.170> list<00:01:43.439> if<00:01:43.680> we<00:01:43.799> go

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
have the broadcast server list if we go

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.920 
have the broadcast server list if we go
and<00:01:44.009> have<00:01:44.220> a<00:01:44.460> look<00:01:44.909> at<00:01:45.090> that<00:01:45.240> you<00:01:45.390> can<00:01:45.509> see<00:01:45.720> all

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
and have a look at that you can see all

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.090 
and have a look at that you can see all
of<00:01:46.049> the<00:01:46.140> different<00:01:46.439> servers<00:01:46.710> that<00:01:46.979> are

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
of the different servers that are

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.460 
of the different servers that are
available<00:01:47.280> to<00:01:47.729> stream<00:01:48.030> to<00:01:48.060> and<00:01:48.479> so<00:01:49.020> once<00:01:49.259> it's

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
available to stream to and so once it's

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:50.990 
available to stream to and so once it's
done<00:01:49.649> connecting<00:01:50.159> to<00:01:50.310> all<00:01:50.430> of<00:01:50.579> them<00:01:50.700> you<00:01:50.850> can

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
done connecting to all of them you can

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.060 
done connecting to all of them you can
see<00:01:51.210> down<00:01:51.390> the<00:01:51.570> side<00:01:51.600> here<00:01:51.810> which<00:01:52.530> is<00:01:52.710> the<00:01:52.860> best

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
see down the side here which is the best

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.760 
see down the side here which is the best
one<00:01:53.250> for<00:01:53.460> you<00:01:53.549> to<00:01:53.729> stream<00:01:54.000> to<00:01:54.350> so<00:01:55.350> there<00:01:55.619> are<00:01:55.740> a

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
one for you to stream to so there are a

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.649 
one for you to stream to so there are a
couple<00:01:55.890> of<00:01:56.219> other<00:01:56.369> changes<00:01:56.610> to<00:01:57.030> the<00:01:57.060> game<00:01:57.390> as

couple of other changes to the game as

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:58.910 
couple of other changes to the game as

game as it is the new splash screen now
as<00:02:05.460> well<00:02:05.640> as<00:02:05.759> this<00:02:05.909> there<00:02:06.180> has<00:02:06.299> also<00:02:06.479> been<00:02:06.659> some

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
as well as this there has also been some

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.960 
as well as this there has also been some
new<00:02:07.200> music<00:02:07.380> added<00:02:07.860> to<00:02:07.979> the<00:02:08.069> game<00:02:08.250> which<00:02:08.729> I

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
new music added to the game which I

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.940 
new music added to the game which I
unfortunately<00:02:09.179> can't<00:02:10.020> show<00:02:10.259> you<00:02:10.319> because<00:02:10.590> for

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
unfortunately can't show you because for

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.070 
unfortunately can't show you because for
some<00:02:11.160> reason<00:02:11.190> my<00:02:11.940> computer<00:02:12.150> is<00:02:12.540> refusing<00:02:12.959> to

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
some reason my computer is refusing to

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.000 
some reason my computer is refusing to
play<00:02:13.349> them

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
play them

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:15.979 
play them
but<00:02:14.280> what<00:02:14.400> I've<00:02:14.489> been<00:02:14.670> told<00:02:14.939> is<00:02:15.209> that<00:02:15.239> it<00:02:15.719> is

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:15.989 
but what I've been told is that it is

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:17.420 
but what I've been told is that it is
based<00:02:16.260> on<00:02:16.469> what<00:02:16.650> you're<00:02:16.769> doing<00:02:16.799> in<00:02:17.129> the<00:02:17.219> game

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
based on what you're doing in the game

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.280 
based on what you're doing in the game
so<00:02:17.700> if<00:02:17.849> you<00:02:17.939> go<00:02:18.090> swimming<00:02:18.150> underwater<00:02:18.840> then

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
so if you go swimming underwater then

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:20.929 
so if you go swimming underwater then
you're<00:02:19.439> gonna<00:02:19.530> hear<00:02:19.799> underwater<00:02:19.980> music<00:02:20.760> and

00:02:20.929 --> 00:02:20.939 
you're gonna hear underwater music and

00:02:20.939 --> 00:02:22.759 
you're gonna hear underwater music and
if<00:02:21.390> you<00:02:21.420> start<00:02:21.719> fighting<00:02:22.109> mobs<00:02:22.349> then<00:02:22.650> you're

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:22.769 
if you start fighting mobs then you're

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:25.250 
if you start fighting mobs then you're
gonna<00:02:22.859> hear<00:02:23.099> battle<00:02:23.489> music<00:02:23.810> so<00:02:24.810> let's<00:02:25.049> take<00:02:25.230> a

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
gonna hear battle music so let's take a

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.500 
gonna hear battle music so let's take a
look<00:02:25.560> at<00:02:25.739> the<00:02:25.920> bug<00:02:26.159> fixes<00:02:26.670> previously<00:02:27.359> you

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
look at the bug fixes previously you

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.390 
look at the bug fixes previously you
were<00:02:27.599> able<00:02:27.810> to<00:02:28.049> duplicate<00:02:28.560> flowers<00:02:29.010> just<00:02:29.189> by

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
were able to duplicate flowers just by

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.099 
were able to duplicate flowers just by
breaking<00:02:29.609> the<00:02:29.969> block<00:02:30.150> underneath<00:02:30.810> a

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:31.109 
breaking the block underneath a

00:02:31.109 --> 00:02:33.020 
breaking the block underneath a
flowerpot<00:02:31.219> this<00:02:32.219> would<00:02:32.400> then<00:02:32.579> drop<00:02:32.790> two

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
flowerpot this would then drop two

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:34.610 
flowerpot this would then drop two
flowers<00:02:33.450> that's<00:02:33.599> been<00:02:33.810> corrected<00:02:34.260> so<00:02:34.409> only

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
flowers that's been corrected so only

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.550 
flowers that's been corrected so only
drops<00:02:34.980> one<00:02:35.219> the<00:02:35.790> textures<00:02:36.239> on<00:02:36.389> beds<00:02:36.659> and<00:02:36.930> doors

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
drops one the textures on beds and doors

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.319 
drops one the textures on beds and doors
were<00:02:37.769> screwed<00:02:38.069> up<00:02:38.219> as<00:02:38.400> most<00:02:38.639> of<00:02:38.790> us<00:02:38.879> know<00:02:38.939> for

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:39.329 
were screwed up as most of us know for

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:40.819 
were screwed up as most of us know for
some<00:02:39.480> reason<00:02:39.780> they<00:02:39.870> displayed<00:02:40.260> incorrectly

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:40.829 
some reason they displayed incorrectly

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:42.589 
some reason they displayed incorrectly
that's<00:02:41.400> been<00:02:41.609> correct<00:02:41.879> so<00:02:42.030> it's<00:02:42.180> now<00:02:42.329> back<00:02:42.540> to

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:42.599 
that's been correct so it's now back to

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:45.530 
that's been correct so it's now back to
normal<00:02:43.099> so<00:02:44.099> previously<00:02:44.609> holding<00:02:44.969> ice<00:02:45.150> in<00:02:45.389> your

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
normal so previously holding ice in your

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.360 
normal so previously holding ice in your
hand<00:02:45.750> the<00:02:45.930> ice<00:02:46.169> wouldn't<00:02:46.530> be<00:02:46.620> transparent<00:02:47.280> it

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
hand the ice wouldn't be transparent it

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:48.619 
hand the ice wouldn't be transparent it
would<00:02:47.489> just<00:02:47.639> have<00:02:47.790> the<00:02:47.909> normal<00:02:48.209> texture<00:02:48.510> on

00:02:48.619 --> 00:02:48.629 
would just have the normal texture on

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:50.240 
would just have the normal texture on
top<00:02:48.689> of<00:02:48.930> it<00:02:49.049> this<00:02:49.169> has<00:02:49.319> been<00:02:49.470> corrected<00:02:49.889> so<00:02:50.099> now

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
top of it this has been corrected so now

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:51.500 
top of it this has been corrected so now
even<00:02:50.639> when<00:02:50.730> you're<00:02:50.849> holding<00:02:50.970> ice<00:02:51.269> in<00:02:51.480> your

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
even when you're holding ice in your

even when you're holding ice in your

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
hand is transparent and you can see for

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.629 
hand is transparent and you can see for
it<00:02:54.209> and<00:02:54.510> we've<00:02:55.349> probably<00:02:55.530> all<00:02:55.889> seen<00:02:55.919> this<00:02:56.400> bug

00:02:56.629 --> 00:02:56.639 
it and we've probably all seen this bug

00:02:56.639 --> 00:02:58.789 
it and we've probably all seen this bug
with<00:02:56.849> the<00:02:56.939> cactus<00:02:57.209> displaying<00:02:58.019> these<00:02:58.560> weird

00:02:58.789 --> 00:02:58.799 
with the cactus displaying these weird

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:00.500 
with the cactus displaying these weird
gaps<00:02:59.069> around<00:02:59.310> the<00:02:59.519> edge<00:02:59.700> of<00:02:59.909> the<00:03:00.000> texture<00:03:00.419> that

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
gaps around the edge of the texture that

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.089 
gaps around the edge of the texture that
has<00:03:00.569> been<00:03:00.840> corrected<00:03:01.019> so<00:03:01.530> it<00:03:01.650> doesn't<00:03:01.980> do<00:03:02.069> that

00:03:02.089 --> 00:03:02.099 
has been corrected so it doesn't do that

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:05.390 
has been corrected so it doesn't do that
anymore<00:03:02.519> and<00:03:03.109> water<00:03:04.109> transparency<00:03:05.040> has<00:03:05.219> been

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
anymore and water transparency has been

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:06.979 
anymore and water transparency has been
corrected<00:03:05.849> previously<00:03:06.419> when<00:03:06.569> standing

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989 
corrected previously when standing

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:08.509 
corrected previously when standing
underneath<00:03:07.379> water<00:03:07.650> it<00:03:08.040> just<00:03:08.219> looked<00:03:08.430> like

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:08.519 
underneath water it just looked like

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:10.339 
underneath water it just looked like
everything<00:03:09.359> above<00:03:09.659> you<00:03:09.840> is<00:03:09.989> made<00:03:10.200> out<00:03:10.319> of

00:03:10.339 --> 00:03:10.349 
everything above you is made out of

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:12.080 
everything above you is made out of
water<00:03:10.590> this<00:03:10.919> has<00:03:11.040> been<00:03:11.189> corrected<00:03:11.639> so<00:03:11.819> you<00:03:11.879> can

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
water this has been corrected so you can

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.030 
water this has been corrected so you can
see<00:03:12.269> the<00:03:12.389> surface<00:03:12.629> and<00:03:13.049> it<00:03:13.620> isn't<00:03:13.919> as

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
see the surface and it isn't as

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.369 
see the surface and it isn't as
transparent<00:03:14.760> so<00:03:15.689> that<00:03:15.870> is<00:03:15.989> pretty<00:03:16.169> much

00:03:16.369 --> 00:03:16.379 
transparent so that is pretty much

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:18.259 
transparent so that is pretty much
