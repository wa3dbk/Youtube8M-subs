 good wizards to everyone and welcome to 

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:08.500
 a magic video more today I bring you another 

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:10.480
 magic trick with cards and it's a trick 

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:13.869
 that I love and we could say that it is 

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:16.449
 a teleportation of a letter of 

00:00:13.869 --> 00:00:19.070
 one place to another I hope you like it and 

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:21.860
 let's start with the effect 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:25.599
 let's start with that effect for 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:25.599
 perform that effect need 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:34.390
 let's start but the effect and for 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:40.300
 perform them we only need 8 letters and 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:42.520
 that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 and 8 these are the 8 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:46.379
 letters and the public should choose 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:49.370
 one so for example this same ship 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:51.230
 fair 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:55.030
 perfect and we mix a little bit so it's 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:55.030
 difficult to mix here but 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:02.150
 perfect and now that is a bit 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:05.420
 mixed let's take two packages of 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:10.280
 four letters and we're going to put by 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:14.320
 example these four letters right here 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:16.860
 and you are four cards 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.860
 fair 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:21.950
 here now we ask the viewer 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.540
 where is the letter here we do not have 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:26.900
 viewer so I ask the camera 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:29.420
 and the camera tells me that it is here and 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:31.720
 now let's start with the magic of 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.720
 true 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:43.259
 just by doing this we can observe that 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.259
 you want a letter has appeared 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:50.680
 and that has appeared here 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:54.610
 face up and this is simply the 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:56.590
 effect is a pretty easy trick of 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:02:00.850
 do but it also surprises a lot 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:04.300
 because the letter goes from here here without 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:05.890
 touch nothing and it's an effect that the 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:06.700
 people I hope you liked it 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:10.420
 you too 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:14.670
