think they're gonna run so since I see
that<00:02:51.000> ribbon<00:02:51.180> and<00:02:51.480> cousin<00:02:51.870> are<00:02:51.930> gonna<00:02:52.079> cut<00:02:52.380> him

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
that ribbon and cousin are gonna cut him

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.170 
that ribbon and cousin are gonna cut him
off<00:02:52.590> that<00:02:52.650> way<00:02:53.010> I<00:02:53.250> know<00:02:53.489> what<00:02:53.700> the<00:02:53.760> position<00:02:53.910> my

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
off that way I know what the position my

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:55.520 
off that way I know what the position my
ultimate<00:02:54.480> somewhere<00:02:54.810> where<00:02:54.959> he's<00:02:55.140> gonna<00:02:55.230> run

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
ultimate somewhere where he's gonna run

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.289 
ultimate somewhere where he's gonna run
through<00:02:55.799> so<00:02:56.310> I'm<00:02:56.430> gonna<00:02:56.579> try<00:02:56.790> and<00:02:56.910> cut<00:02:57.060> him<00:02:57.150> off

00:02:57.289 --> 00:02:57.299 
through so I'm gonna try and cut him off

00:02:57.299 --> 00:02:59.120 
through so I'm gonna try and cut him off
so<00:02:57.600> he<00:02:57.630> can't<00:02:57.930> get<00:02:58.019> away<00:02:58.079> so<00:02:58.769> let's<00:02:58.980> talk<00:02:59.070> about

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
so he can't get away so let's talk about

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:01.280 
so he can't get away so let's talk about
team<00:02:59.549> fights<00:02:59.820> with<00:03:00.000> Pantheon<00:03:00.480> basically

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
team fights with Pantheon basically

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:02.840 
team fights with Pantheon basically
Pantheon<00:03:01.680> is<00:03:01.739> gonna<00:03:01.890> be<00:03:02.100> the<00:03:02.250> initiator<00:03:02.489> in

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:02.850 
Pantheon is gonna be the initiator in

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:04.940 
Pantheon is gonna be the initiator in
most<00:03:03.150> teamfights<00:03:03.630> as<00:03:03.900> whoever<00:03:04.380> he's<00:03:04.680> going<00:03:04.860> to

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
most teamfights as whoever he's going to

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:06.920 
most teamfights as whoever he's going to
go<00:03:05.070> on<00:03:05.190> is<00:03:05.370> going<00:03:05.760> to<00:03:05.850> die<00:03:06.030> since<00:03:06.540> his<00:03:06.750> team's

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
go on is going to die since his team's

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:08.400 
go on is going to die since his team's
gonna<00:03:07.079> follow<00:03:07.350> up<00:03:07.530> on<00:03:07.680> to<00:03:07.799> that

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:08.410 
gonna follow up on to that

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:09.990 
gonna follow up on to that
but<00:03:08.530> I<00:03:08.560> think<00:03:08.860> the<00:03:08.920> most<00:03:09.070> important<00:03:09.550> part<00:03:09.760> of<00:03:09.910> a

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
but I think the most important part of a

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.640 
but I think the most important part of a
patent<00:03:10.390> is<00:03:10.570> the<00:03:10.690> positioning<00:03:11.380> of<00:03:11.500> his

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650 
patent is the positioning of his

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:13.440 
patent is the positioning of his
ultimate<00:03:12.100> so<00:03:12.580> let's<00:03:12.760> go<00:03:12.880> over<00:03:13.060> that<00:03:13.180> before

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:13.450 
ultimate so let's go over that before

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:15.030 
ultimate so let's go over that before
explaining<00:03:14.170> how<00:03:14.440> to<00:03:14.470> team<00:03:14.740> fight<00:03:14.920> with

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.040 
explaining how to team fight with

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.130 
explaining how to team fight with
Matthew<00:03:15.370> so<00:03:16.000> whenever<00:03:16.180> I'm<00:03:16.450> about<00:03:16.720> to<00:03:16.870> use<00:03:16.990> my

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:17.140 
Matthew so whenever I'm about to use my

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:18.420 
Matthew so whenever I'm about to use my
ultimate<00:03:17.500> I'm<00:03:17.650> going<00:03:17.800> to<00:03:17.860> want<00:03:18.040> to<00:03:18.100> hit<00:03:18.280> as

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:18.430 
ultimate I'm going to want to hit as

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:20.250 
ultimate I'm going to want to hit as
much<00:03:18.640> people<00:03:18.820> as<00:03:19.000> I<00:03:19.150> can<00:03:19.210> with<00:03:19.570> it<00:03:19.750> because

a flash air force an enemy escape if you

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:28.650 
a flash air force an enemy escape if you
haven't<00:03:27.520> used<00:03:27.700> your<00:03:27.790> ultimate<00:03:28.120> yet<00:03:28.330> but<00:03:28.510> II

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:28.660 
haven't used your ultimate yet but II

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:30.240 
haven't used your ultimate yet but II
won<00:03:28.840> the<00:03:28.960> team<00:03:29.140> fight<00:03:29.290> already<00:03:29.440> you<00:03:29.920> can<00:03:30.070> use

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 
won the team fight already you can use

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:32.010 
won the team fight already you can use
to<00:03:30.280> your<00:03:30.520> ultimate<00:03:30.820> to<00:03:31.000> cut<00:03:31.330> people<00:03:31.450> off<00:03:31.630> and

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:32.020 
to your ultimate to cut people off and

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:33.630 
to your ultimate to cut people off and
let<00:03:32.170> yourself<00:03:32.260> more<00:03:32.680> kills<00:03:32.920> we<00:03:33.160> can<00:03:33.310> go<00:03:33.430> for

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:33.640 
let yourself more kills we can go for

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:36.030 
let yourself more kills we can go for
more<00:03:33.760> objectives<00:03:34.300> so<00:03:35.050> my<00:03:35.260> last<00:03:35.410> point<00:03:35.710> on<00:03:35.890> this

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040 
more objectives so my last point on this

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:37.920 
more objectives so my last point on this
video<00:03:36.340> will<00:03:36.580> be<00:03:36.760> what<00:03:37.390> if<00:03:37.510> the<00:03:37.630> enemy

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:37.930 
video will be what if the enemy

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:39.810 
video will be what if the enemy
initiates<00:03:38.410> on<00:03:38.590> you<00:03:38.800> this<00:03:39.340> means<00:03:39.550> you<00:03:39.640> probably

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:39.820 
initiates on you this means you probably

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:41.850 
initiates on you this means you probably
won't<00:03:40.090> be<00:03:40.180> using<00:03:40.360> your<00:03:40.510> ultimate<00:03:40.930> as<00:03:41.170> you're

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:41.860 
won't be using your ultimate as you're

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:44.250 
won't be using your ultimate as you're
already<00:03:42.070> in<00:03:42.310> the<00:03:42.430> fight<00:03:42.640> so<00:03:43.000> what<00:03:43.180> I<00:03:43.210> do<00:03:43.300> is<00:03:43.720> I

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.260

just let them do the damage and so I'm
just<00:03:47.890> going<00:03:48.010> to<00:03:48.070> use<00:03:48.220> my<00:03:48.250> e<00:03:48.400> to<00:03:48.820> hit<00:03:48.970> as<00:03:49.060> much

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:49.210 
just going to use my e to hit as much

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:51.180 
just going to use my e to hit as much
people<00:03:49.420> as<00:03:49.570> I<00:03:49.720> can<00:03:49.780> throw<00:03:50.560> my<00:03:50.680> spirit<00:03:51.010> whoever

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:51.190 
people as I can throw my spirit whoever

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:53.550 
people as I can throw my spirit whoever

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:55.600 
team will focus usually this doesn't

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:57.780 
team will focus usually this doesn't
happen<00:03:55.750> as<00:03:56.200> Pantheon<00:03:56.950> usually<00:03:57.400> is<00:03:57.640> the

happen as Pantheon usually is the

00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:59.940 
happen as Pantheon usually is the
initiator<00:03:58.030> of<00:03:58.300> most<00:03:58.570> fights<00:03:58.870> and<00:03:59.230> you<00:03:59.260> kind<00:03:59.860> of

00:03:59.940 --> 00:03:59.950 
initiator of most fights and you kind of

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:01.440 
initiator of most fights and you kind of
our<00:04:00.070> disadvantage<00:04:00.850> since<00:04:00.970> you<00:04:01.120> don't<00:04:01.300> use

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:01.450 
our disadvantage since you don't use

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:03.390 
our disadvantage since you don't use
your<00:04:01.480> ultimate<00:04:01.840> as<00:04:02.140> it<00:04:02.650> does<00:04:02.770> have<00:04:02.950> high<00:04:03.160> base

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:03.400 
your ultimate as it does have high base

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.610 
your ultimate as it does have high base
damage<00:04:03.670> and<00:04:04.090> it<00:04:04.540> allows<00:04:04.900> you<00:04:05.080> to<00:04:05.170> be<00:04:05.320> divert
