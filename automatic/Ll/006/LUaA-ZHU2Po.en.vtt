00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 so that's him so today I'll tell you 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.089
 reassures the cruiser on how 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:09.900
 customize its terminals in two ways 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:12.540
 different with care of the grip that goes 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.009
 do on my option of a globe or be 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.839
 with two there squarely painting 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:28.140
 we are going to do on our lots so here we go 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:30.869
 we go custom it's skateboard 2 hours a 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.669
 other bus stop that is going to be a lot more 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:36.930
 committed to the pension it will depend when 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:39.149
 justin 6 or so and then take care of me 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:43.950
 because we are going to charge 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:46.469
 we will do any form of form that is at 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.149
 to say to do like splinters not put 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.340
 a little bit everywhere we wanted 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:53.430
 make a sale of the center as per 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.750
 example with that because I'm going 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.020
 try to do today it's in 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:02.969
 torn effect 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:04.710
 so we're just going to torn apart 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:11.159
 bar small mist years after you have 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:14.299
 seen similar volts and that 's the form 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.299
 fairly straight though if the offer 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:23.750
 by size on one side make sure that 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:27.220
 it's just right that it knows you 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.220
 look at that for now 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:33.649
 for example , evoked brest 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:37.220
 could splinter a next 

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:42.500
 once at the end on a yes it's great a 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:43.729
 little bit further still so I'm going 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.799
 make small adjustments 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:47.060
 so this is as straight as you can 

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:48.289
 and concludes the base it's simply 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.399
 torn jelly northern trades and 

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:50.689
 programs in stern and due form at this 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:52.720
 it is right but because it 

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:55.039
 comes scheer and we meet again 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:58.009
 so it's good I have something of a 

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:59.390
 pretty much right so we'll put it 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:01.610
 on the edge 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:06.380
 we're just going to take it apart 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:09.319
 as a normal fact that they color 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:11.000
 that's how it is so we have this 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:12.230
 group what are these homes all 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.209
 integrate quickly but hey if it's just 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:16.940
 for grammont do that that I you 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:17.930
 advises rays trucks and who 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.370
 finds and it's that buying costs 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.049
 side the neck hours it costs 5 euros 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.280
 there are other reasons it is to the 

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:24.170
 up for the scooters I believe 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:27.620
 but the oms is also used for 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:32.799
 customers so we'll put it like that 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:37.160
 for example we will simply glued 

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:39.079
 and that gives us that so that's where the 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:44.900
 chisel is going to serve simply we will cut 

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:46.850
 what goes beyond then we do not use 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.950
 the rule must be taken into account is 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:50.150
 will also have a rule and daddy's 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:53.630
 covered will serve as the rule for 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:54.889
 really flatten out what's appropriate 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:56.840
 dollar cam shops that face but 

00:02:54.889 --> 00:03:00.650
 good logically it's congress 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:04.020
 hold well here 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:06.060
 so that gives pretty much that makes us 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:07.560
 always friendly then even for 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:09.210
 to go 17 even be practical for good 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:14.130
 put his feet for example the birth 

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:15.900
 here it is so it's perfect 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:16.920
 last little thing I advise 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.930
 to really keep everything that is 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:21.030
 little bit ripped off like that it can 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:22.410
 always be reused as what 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:25.170
 that they made burst paris with 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:27.050
 small ribs and this without lifting 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:30.060
 new things for example that's it 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:32.370
 you put them when you feel keep 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:36.810
 the ca can stay practical we see there 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:38.730
 it was flu tutos not surviving 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:42.200
 second canteen to subscribe to ask 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:42.200
 questions there will be a key question
