00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:11.309
 the ajax women are in full swing 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.660
 preparation for the second 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.130
 competition half 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.439
 it starts on Friday evening with the 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.240
 away game against aa gent 

00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:20.430
 team of trainer ed engelkes wants the 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.560
 continue the line from last year with 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.770
 the highlight is winning the NFL 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.770
 cup 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:37.460
 warm nice and yes big party i think 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:41.030
 very proud of the team 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:42.379
 what a changeable season and you know 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:43.610
 have a good team 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:45.620
 yes it was a nice reward for us 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:47.450
 on the season then I saw at least 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:49.280
 a team that wanted at all costs 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:50.449
 win and it was definitely a new sit 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.610
 not all good either because we did 

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:56.540
 but we do make two fantastic ones 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:58.580
 goals and year PSV also gave afterwards 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:00.590
 We have never had a moment's idea 

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:01.400
 that we are actually winning something here 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:04.100
 had 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:05.479
 yes you radiate that as a team and 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.830
 the closer all the space suddenly appears 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:08.780
 ajax and train 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:11.600
 a corner variant that made him one 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:13.130
 counter yields this is not what psv can do 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.920
 but yaks has the 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:19.750
 possibilities and the up and tower that is 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.750
 beautifully played the ajax 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:23.840
 that was a great moment for that 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:25.850
 matchwinner mandy is so beautiful 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.770
 if the preseason ended like that 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:29.300
 the new de started dramatically 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:31.220
 On the right , agents ran space 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:34.759
 injury on the winning goal in the 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:36.950
 final was run go last winning 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:38.860
 goal deep shadow still dreams 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:42.470
 yes yes that was a very nice moment 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:45.319
 indeed, I do not score anyway 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:47.899
 so often my head so it's a dress 

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:48.830
 indeed forget super counter too 

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:51.470
 awesome 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:54.860
 yes he was indeed at the 3 3 Easter Sunday 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:56.479
 ball in the net and yes that was gave one 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.250
 very good feeling 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:00.709
 yes you're still going to shine yes 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:01.640
 account direction then that makes me oh yes 

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:03.649
 hell yes 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.690
 Versteegt is determined to have one 

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:07.759
 month or two strong to come back then 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:09.380
 will that is desperately needed because the 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:11.360
 selection is in the meantime through 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:13.370
 several new players only 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.959
 got better that is quite true that 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.209
 On the one hand, it is good for you 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:20.420
 for the competition on the other hand 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:21.980
 he pebbles await how yes that 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:23.900
 people who must come back how that again 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:26.270
 might be fitted in maybe 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:28.099
 with practice games shepherd 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:29.840
 but yes on the other hand it makes it 

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:31.010
 team big derek and that is also what we do 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.470
 in the struggle for it 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:34.810
 championship so what is it 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:36.760
 just fine 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:38.500
 2 players who go to long absence 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:41.890
 hope to make a return soon 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:43.870
 his day the sexton and leonne stentler 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:46.000
 Routiers Cost came back as proud 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:49.150
 mother and stentler has recovered from one 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:52.269
 heavy achilles tendon well that make 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:52.890
 a good impression just are not there yet 

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:54.630
 and 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:57.000
 also have difficulty enough to hook up 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:57.990
 and that says everything about not not about 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.300
 their 

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:02.340
 but that says more about those who 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:05.250
 because they do it in the end 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:07.920
 good and the level is just very high 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:09.810
 so it will it will be for both day after 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:16.500
 as a leon to be a tough job 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:20.190
 to play myself in the team and me 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:22.080
 determined how sharp the team is and you 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:23.280
 now can not forsake a moment you know that 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:25.260
 the moment that you are not doing well 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:27.030
 a child does not train well yes then you go 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.920
 don't finish it yet but it is 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:30.510
 that you have to worry and that you 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:33.930
 must make an effort and that you must ensure that 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:35.220
 you are top top top fit and not half past 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:36.989
 I think I can handle it 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:38.730
 handbrake on that is therefore not possible 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:40.410
 the bar is higher and higher this season 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:42.300
 therefore we find ajax on the 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:44.820
 second place in the bene league one point 

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:45.989
 behind standard hatch and 4 points in front 

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:47.340
 FC Twente 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:49.019
 the competitor in the battle for it 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:50.459
 championship of the netherlands 

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:52.440
 the classification is provisional 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:55.040
 result of a good first 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:55.040
 competition half 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:05.370
 Kim 

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:13.129
 how do you stay 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:13.129
 the pointed cabbage 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:34.220
 dream with good performance 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:36.349
 internationals like saint claudia 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:39.050
 mountain of a beautiful world cup with dutch 

00:04:36.349 --> 00:04:40.699
 team and about success with ajax 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:42.590
 before that, the team had a good year 

00:04:40.699 --> 00:04:44.960
 start going thousands next week 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:47.419
 topper against FC Twente and to begin with 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:49.400
 Friday in Belgium against AA Gent 

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:51.379
 yes I think we should be right there 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:53.090
 show what is being saved because of the week 

00:04:51.379 --> 00:04:55.099
 after that you still have twente and yes that is 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:57.229
 a crucial competition 

00:04:55.099 --> 00:04:59.930
 then you know very quickly at city 

00:04:57.229 --> 00:05:01.430
 yes yes exactly after and don't care 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:03.979
 the guns just want points 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:05.240
 and winning twice would be nice 

00:05:03.979 --> 00:05:06.470
 to the first 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:08.330
 how do they say first blow is one 

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:10.039
 worth less 

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:12.440
 well that's right so you have to be right 

00:05:10.039 --> 00:05:14.870
 we cannot lose points 

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:16.340
 and because our competitors do 

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:17.360
 also their thing that will also be one 

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:18.590
 want to win competitions 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:20.509
 well then you will only find out again 

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:21.800
 the facts and now we are in charge 

00:05:20.509 --> 00:05:24.199
 the position we are in 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:24.800
 great a nice worry that you continue 

00:05:24.199 --> 00:05:26.750
 keep going 

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:29.599
 with a goal for the team there is this 

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:31.909
 season but a price that counts 

00:05:29.599 --> 00:05:33.830
 just grab that scale and any points 

00:05:31.909 --> 00:05:37.130
 which we get every point that we pick up is just 

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:39.620
 men that goal for this year is to be in 

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:41.479
 my esters with a scale 

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:45.370
 and winning the prize requires a 

00:05:41.479 --> 00:05:45.370
 wet suit whether you like it or not 

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:59.270
 yes that is my highlight of 2014 

00:05:56.510 --> 00:06:01.400
 think there are two then quickly and then again 

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:03.410

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:06.160

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:06.160
 two fingers in my nose 

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.590
 yes but this time the whole bucket 

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:20.100
 water over his head and please 

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:22.560
 agreed agreed I hope that 

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:23.910
 shower then comes longer after that 

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:27.290

00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:27.290
