00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:09.760
 the ring is sometimes called the place more 

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:11.950
 lonely of the world a place where nobody 

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:13.960
 can help you once the fight 

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:16.119
 start the coach is the most ally 

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:19.570
 close to the boxer and not just like 

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:22.869
 coach but as a counselor motivator 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:25.000
 and friend and in the case of Miguel Cotto that 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:26.739
 situation is clear and has problems 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.849
 to find stability in your corner 

00:00:26.739 --> 00:00:33.250
 Miguel Cotto moved away from what he did 

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:35.469
 be what it is today when it started 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:37.450
 it was at 140 pounds it was a severe 

00:00:35.469 --> 00:00:38.710
 puncher to the body an oppressive fighter 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:41.440
 and pressure that could end up 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:45.220
 whatever that accomplished under evangelist 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:47.680
 cotto when going to 147 pounds he did 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:49.450
 under the great Manuel Stuart who tried 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:51.310
 to refine some of the skills of 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:53.260
 cotto and then left when the cuban 

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:55.180
 Pedro Díaz who really changed his 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:58.780
 style and turned it into something that is not 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:01.989
 I try to avoid blows that 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:04.390
 moved around the ring and changed all 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:06.490
 his essence to miguel has lacked 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:08.680
 leadership in your corner maybe for the 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:09.909
 last five years of his career his uncle 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.740
 he taught him 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:13.990
 relatives walked side by side with 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:15.729
 different trainers but always 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:17.200
 trained himself Miguel was the 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:19.899
 fighter and trained himself 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.670
 after two consecutive defeats 

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:24.789
 He counted, he decided to go with him three times 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:27.130
 coach of the year freddie roach is my 

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:30.340
 type of boxer he is hard is fighter 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:32.829
 and the truth is not one and I like the 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:35.439
 boxers who fight when I started with 

00:01:32.829 --> 00:01:37.270
 medel asked him what had happened in 

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:39.759
 the last two fights and he told me not to 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:43.569
 he felt the same one that did not hit the 

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:46.060
 body that is its strong and that is only 

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:47.530
 doing it just because and that he and his 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:49.899
 coaches have not been in the same 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:52.390
 channel so we're recovering what 

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:53.709
 Miguel used to be Freddy by 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:56.739
 first time in our corner is 

00:01:53.709 --> 00:02:00.939
 incredible freddy is a professional in 

00:01:56.739 --> 00:02:03.459
 everything he makes me work hard makes me 

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:06.789
 return to be the miguel cotto of 

00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:08.560
 principle sometimes over the years 

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:10.840
 people believe that you have to do more 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.670
 but in reality you have to do less 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.770
 and in a more practical way 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.510
 when he 's in the gym he's one of the 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:18.520
 more disciplined people that I have 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:21.190
 trained his work ethic is 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:23.200
 great after a successful 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:25.720
 training their first fight together 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:28.330
 it was against a much higher fighter a 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:31.150
 considerate man very resistant delvin 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:33.610
 Rodriguez was watching the videos of 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:36.010
 elvin rodríguez and I thought who is this 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:38.110
 holy type heavens is a bad loss 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:39.970
 for us the guy is tall he's very 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:42.340
 uncomfortable so I started studying it and 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:44.260
 generate a plan of attack and I said so 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:46.150
 It is how we will make this fight 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.370
 I said to miguel so let's fight against 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:50.530
 this guy because he is very very skilled and is 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:52.360
 very uncomfortable is not a typical fighter 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:54.310
 it has an advantage in its height but when 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:57.480
 fight against someone lower crouch 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:03:00.170
 and loses its advantage with height 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:02.680
 great left hook to body photos 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:02.680
 to end 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:08.780
 it's not me 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:20.480
 it's a rain of goal 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:20.480
 by Miguel Cotto and points out this range 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:29.350
 level did see the simple fight the 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:31.420
 truth of the single overwhelmed him in the fight he 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:34.510
 He hid the plan of attack such as 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:36.810
 we designed and did everything perfect in that 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:36.810
 Fight 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:49.700
 I had no chance to win 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:52.190
 today he is a different fighter now 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:54.410
 We could see the work he has done with 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:57.110
 his talent in the fight against Rodríguez 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:59.959
 and showed that Miguel Cotto is a fighter 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:02.810
 special one thing that rod has given him 

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:05.390
 is to understand his identity and what he 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:07.970
 is and what we saw in the fight with delvin 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:09.709
 rodríguez was not a new miguel cotto 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:12.130
 but in fact the miguel cotto 

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:12.130
 previous 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:23.169
 Miguel Cotto Sergio Martin is a 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:25.120
 legendary warrior in front of the 

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:27.610
 superstar middleweight champion 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:30.069
 strong left hand of the cinemas and 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:32.620
 volker that low in fact change these 

00:04:30.069 --> 00:04:34.780
 knocks thunder and a left hook 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:36.880
 top of cotto is hammering 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:39.639
 when he is punishing him with his blows 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:42.350
 they will rise is not blocked coconut 

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:44.810
