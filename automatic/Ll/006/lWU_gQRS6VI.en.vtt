you<00:00:11.219> know<00:00:11.340> obviously<00:00:11.580> this<00:00:12.120> is<00:00:12.300> a<00:00:12.330> different

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
you know obviously this is a different

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.340 
you know obviously this is a different
approach<00:00:13.049> to<00:00:13.799> take<00:00:14.130> with<00:00:14.429> Rigoletto<00:00:15.389> most

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
approach to take with Rigoletto most

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.359 
approach to take with Rigoletto most
often<00:00:16.830> it<00:00:17.010> is<00:00:17.160> done<00:00:17.970> with<00:00:18.300> a<00:00:18.330> pillow<00:00:19.199> or<00:00:19.320> a<00:00:19.529> pad

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
often it is done with a pillow or a pad

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.400 
often it is done with a pillow or a pad
that's<00:00:20.670> an<00:00:20.850> attached<00:00:21.150> to<00:00:21.449> a<00:00:21.480> t-shirt<00:00:21.930> or<00:00:22.170> as

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
that's an attached to a t-shirt or as

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.009 
that's an attached to a t-shirt or as
part<00:00:22.920> of<00:00:23.010> the<00:00:23.130> costume<00:00:23.390> but<00:00:24.390> I<00:00:24.420> think<00:00:24.750> in<00:00:24.869> this

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
part of the costume but I think in this

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.109 
part of the costume but I think in this
case<00:00:25.080> they're<00:00:26.010> probably<00:00:26.279> perhaps<00:00:26.910> two

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
case they're probably perhaps two

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.320 
case they're probably perhaps two
reasons<00:00:27.539> that<00:00:27.599> I<00:00:27.750> can<00:00:27.990> I<00:00:28.230> think<00:00:28.830> that<00:00:29.490> Jeff<00:00:29.760> our

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
reasons that I can I think that Jeff our

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.500 
reasons that I can I think that Jeff our
director<00:00:30.539> Jeff<00:00:31.140> Buckman<00:00:31.790> wanted<00:00:32.790> to<00:00:33.030> approach

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
director Jeff Buckman wanted to approach

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.560 
director Jeff Buckman wanted to approach
it<00:00:33.719> from<00:00:33.750> this<00:00:34.020> standpoint<00:00:34.260> was<00:00:34.620> one<00:00:34.860> he<00:00:35.579> I

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
it from this standpoint was one he I

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.930 
it from this standpoint was one he I
think<00:00:37.110> wanted<00:00:37.530> it<00:00:37.649> to<00:00:37.770> feel<00:00:37.980> more<00:00:38.250> real<00:00:38.550> as

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
think wanted it to feel more real as

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.049 
think wanted it to feel more real as
part<00:00:39.270> of<00:00:39.540> the<00:00:39.899> actual<00:00:40.379> body<00:00:40.620> of<00:00:40.920> Mark<00:00:41.730> in<00:00:41.910> this

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
part of the actual body of Mark in this

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.670 
part of the actual body of Mark in this
case<00:00:42.270> and<00:00:42.860> two<00:00:43.860> he<00:00:44.460> wants<00:00:44.879> to<00:00:45.090> really<00:00:45.840> set<00:00:46.410> the

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
case and two he wants to really set the

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.479 
case and two he wants to really set the
tone<00:00:47.129> and<00:00:47.610> the<00:00:48.500> concept<00:00:49.500> of<00:00:49.620> what<00:00:49.920> Rigoletto

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
tone and the concept of what Rigoletto

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.619 
tone and the concept of what Rigoletto
is<00:00:50.760> dealing<00:00:51.270> with<00:00:51.300> in<00:00:51.809> terms<00:00:52.350> of<00:00:52.559> his<00:00:52.620> own<00:00:52.860> body

00:00:53.619 --> 00:00:53.629 
is dealing with in terms of his own body

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:56.029 
is dealing with in terms of his own body
at<00:00:54.629> the<00:00:54.809> very<00:00:54.960> beginning<00:00:55.140> of<00:00:55.440> the<00:00:55.530> Opera<00:00:55.920> and

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
at the very beginning of the Opera and

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.979 
at the very beginning of the Opera and
therefore<00:00:56.460> wants<00:00:57.090> the<00:00:57.210> audience<00:00:57.629> to<00:00:57.840> really

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
therefore wants the audience to really

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.000 
therefore wants the audience to really
see<00:00:58.350> the<00:00:58.949> deformity<00:00:59.609> the<00:00:59.910> hump<00:01:00.350> in<00:01:01.350> a<00:01:01.530> real<00:01:01.739> way

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
see the deformity the hump in a real way

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.700 
see the deformity the hump in a real way
as<00:01:02.160> opposed<00:01:02.520> to<00:01:02.760> hidden<00:01:03.539> under<00:01:03.809> a<00:01:03.840> costume<00:01:04.379> so

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
as opposed to hidden under a costume so

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.890 
as opposed to hidden under a costume so
I<00:01:05.430> think<00:01:05.670> those<00:01:05.909> are<00:01:05.970> probably<00:01:06.659> the<00:01:06.810> two

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
I think those are probably the two

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.539 
I think those are probably the two
reasons<00:01:07.380> to<00:01:07.530> approach<00:01:07.799> it<00:01:07.979> this<00:01:08.100> way<00:01:08.280> and<00:01:08.460> it

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
reasons to approach it this way and it

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:09.920 
reasons to approach it this way and it
will<00:01:08.729> be<00:01:08.820> interesting<00:01:09.060> to<00:01:09.299> see<00:01:09.479> how<00:01:09.510> it<00:01:09.720> works

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
will be interesting to see how it works

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.899 
will be interesting to see how it works
yeah<00:01:10.320> he<00:01:10.950> talked<00:01:11.130> to<00:01:11.220> I<00:01:11.310> wasn't<00:01:11.610> seeing<00:01:11.729> where

work the media fish came in to all his
body<00:02:23.270> hair<00:02:23.570> so<00:02:24.290> that<00:02:24.470> when<00:02:24.709> we<00:02:24.890> were<00:02:25.100> putting

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:25.520 
body hair so that when we were putting

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:28.150 
body hair so that when we were putting
the<00:02:25.790> plaster<00:02:26.510> or<00:02:26.570> the<00:02:26.690> alginate<00:02:27.110> on<00:02:27.320> that<00:02:27.950> it

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160 
the plaster or the alginate on that it

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.390 
the plaster or the alginate on that it
would<00:02:28.400> not<00:02:28.840> stick<00:02:29.840> to<00:02:29.959> him<00:02:30.110> do<00:02:30.560> these<00:02:30.709> fairly

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
would not stick to him do these fairly

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.810 
would not stick to him do these fairly
easily<00:02:31.640> we<00:02:32.360> put<00:02:33.110> layers<00:02:33.500> of<00:02:33.830> plaster<00:02:34.310> bandages

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:34.820 
easily we put layers of plaster bandages

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:39.130 
easily we put layers of plaster bandages
over<00:02:35.690> his<00:02:36.050> back<00:02:36.290> and<00:02:37.010> created<00:02:37.580> like<00:02:37.730> a<00:02:38.140> scene

over his back and created like a scene
here<00:02:39.170> and<00:02:40.160> then<00:02:40.550> we<00:02:40.790> mix<00:02:41.300> up<00:02:41.570> alginate<00:02:42.200> which

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230 
here and then we mix up alginate which

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:45.820 
here and then we mix up alginate which
is<00:02:42.500> sort<00:02:42.709> of<00:02:42.740> like<00:02:42.890> this<00:02:43.130> mode<00:02:44.060> capturing<00:02:44.830> gel

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:45.830 
is sort of like this mode capturing gel

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:48.790 
is sort of like this mode capturing gel
that<00:02:46.130> has<00:02:46.940> hence<00:02:47.209> part<00:02:47.959> about<00:02:48.110> five<00:02:48.470> to<00:02:48.770> eight

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:48.800 
that has hence part about five to eight

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.880 
that has hence part about five to eight
minutes<00:02:48.890> set<00:02:49.490> time<00:02:49.730> mix<00:02:50.600> that<00:02:50.750> up<00:02:50.810> smooth<00:02:51.770> it

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
that on and put more plaster bandage

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.350 
that on and put more plaster bandage
over<00:02:57.620> that<00:02:57.920> once<00:02:58.459> we<00:02:58.640> have<00:02:58.790> this<00:02:58.910> together<00:02:59.090> you

00:02:59.350 --> 00:02:59.360 
over that once we have this together you

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:05.560 
over that once we have this together you
put<00:02:59.540> the<00:02:59.690> one<00:03:00.200> piece<00:03:03.370> like<00:03:04.370> so<00:03:04.640> another<00:03:05.300> piece

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:05.570 
put the one piece like so another piece

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:10.690 
put the one piece like so another piece
like<00:03:05.900> so<00:03:06.260> and<00:03:07.720> we<00:03:08.720> fill<00:03:09.709> the<00:03:09.920> inside<00:03:10.310> with<00:03:10.340> a

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 
like so and we fill the inside with a

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.350 
like so and we fill the inside with a
hard<00:03:11.660> plaster<00:03:12.290> and<00:03:12.709> once<00:03:13.430> that's<00:03:13.640> set<00:03:14.120> we

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:14.360 
hard plaster and once that's set we

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:17.949 
hard plaster and once that's set we
harden<00:03:14.769> we<00:03:15.769> have<00:03:15.950> this<00:03:16.910> finished<00:03:17.239> flat<00:03:17.660> cast

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:17.959 
harden we have this finished flat cast

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:20.199 
harden we have this finished flat cast
in<00:03:18.200> front<00:03:18.440> of<00:03:18.500> you<00:03:18.590> that<00:03:19.220> we<00:03:19.519> just<00:03:19.820> have<00:03:20.090> to

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:20.209 
in front of you that we just have to

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:21.820 
in front of you that we just have to
clean<00:03:20.450> up<00:03:20.480> and<00:03:20.780> stand<00:03:21.019> out<00:03:21.230> and<00:03:21.380> smooth<00:03:21.650> down

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:21.830 
clean up and stand out and smooth down

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:25.000 
clean up and stand out and smooth down
so<00:03:22.040> we<00:03:22.130> can<00:03:22.250> start<00:03:22.459> sculpting<00:03:23.410> clay<00:03:24.410> to<00:03:24.709> create

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.010 
so we can start sculpting clay to create

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:27.070 
so we can start sculpting clay to create
the<00:03:25.100> prosthetics<00:03:25.580> on<00:03:25.700> top<00:03:25.910> of<00:03:26.030> it<00:03:26.120> because<00:03:27.049> of

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:27.080 
the prosthetics on top of it because of

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:28.930 
the prosthetics on top of it because of
the<00:03:27.290> way<00:03:27.470> I'm<00:03:27.530> tanning<00:03:27.920> salon<00:03:28.400> because<00:03:28.610> of<00:03:28.850> the

the way I'm tanning salon because of the

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:29.360 
the way I'm tanning salon because of the
extent

nature's of this particular appliances
who<00:03:31.860> are<00:03:32.159> going<00:03:32.400> to<00:03:32.459> have<00:03:32.610> to<00:03:32.879> make<00:03:33.180> more<00:03:33.870> than

who are going to have to make more than

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.289 
who are going to have to make more than
one<00:03:34.260> appliance<00:03:34.590> just<00:03:35.069> so<00:03:35.280> if<00:03:35.970> something

00:03:36.289 --> 00:03:36.299 
one appliance just so if something

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:38.750 
one appliance just so if something
happens<00:03:36.690> or<00:03:36.840> their<00:03:36.989> hairs<00:03:37.260> and<00:03:37.760> application

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
happens or their hairs and application

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.119 
happens or their hairs and application
that<00:03:38.849> they<00:03:39.360> were<00:03:39.420> back<00:03:39.720> up<00:03:39.989> each<00:03:40.709> set<00:03:41.099> will

00:03:41.119 --> 00:03:41.129 
that they were back up each set will

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:43.100 
that they were back up each set will
probably<00:03:41.610> only<00:03:41.700> last<00:03:42.030> a<00:03:42.180> couple<00:03:42.209> performances

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:43.110 
probably only last a couple performances

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:47.420 
probably only last a couple performances
so<00:03:43.409> let's<00:03:44.190> say<00:03:44.430> out<00:03:44.819> of<00:03:45.409> performances<00:03:46.430> or

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
so let's say out of performances or

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:49.460 
so let's say out of performances or
seven<00:03:47.790> performances<00:03:48.060> will<00:03:48.810> probably<00:03:49.260> wear

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:49.470 
seven performances will probably wear

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:54.349 
seven performances will probably wear
one<00:03:50.069> set<00:03:50.489> every<00:03:51.019> two<00:03:52.019> three
