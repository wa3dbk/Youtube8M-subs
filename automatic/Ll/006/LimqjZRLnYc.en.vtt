hey it's Derek from guitar center I'm

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:03.560 
hey it's Derek from guitar center I'm
sitting<00:00:01.949> here<00:00:02.040> with<00:00:02.190> Ben<00:00:02.490> from<00:00:02.850> sure<00:00:03.090> and

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:03.570 
sitting here with Ben from sure and

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:05.390 
sitting here with Ben from sure and
today<00:00:04.020> we're<00:00:04.200> talking<00:00:04.350> about<00:00:04.529> the<00:00:04.770> shirt<00:00:05.009> SM

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:05.400 
today we're talking about the shirt SM

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.369 
today we're talking about the shirt SM
81<00:00:05.819> tell<00:00:06.330> us<00:00:06.420> some<00:00:06.660> key<00:00:06.870> points<00:00:07.080> on<00:00:07.290> the

00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:07.379 
81 tell us some key points on the

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:09.200 
81 tell us some key points on the
microphone<00:00:07.770> and<00:00:07.830> maybe<00:00:08.280> some<00:00:08.490> of<00:00:08.580> the<00:00:08.639> popular

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210 
microphone and maybe some of the popular

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.560 
microphone and maybe some of the popular
applications<00:00:09.840> absolutely<00:00:10.710> so<00:00:11.280> this<00:00:11.429> m81<00:00:12.000> is<00:00:12.240> a

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
applications absolutely so this m81 is a

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.870 
applications absolutely so this m81 is a
cardioid<00:00:13.170> condenser<00:00:13.259> mic<00:00:13.980> so<00:00:14.190> it's<00:00:14.370> designed

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
cardioid condenser mic so it's designed

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.640 
cardioid condenser mic so it's designed
primarily<00:00:15.330> for<00:00:15.809> use<00:00:16.560> with<00:00:16.740> overhead<00:00:17.490> cymbals

want a nice bright sound and you need to

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.769

pick<00:00:25.650> up<00:00:25.680> the<00:00:26.099> very<00:00:26.490> top<00:00:26.730> of<00:00:26.880> the<00:00:27.000> source<00:00:27.180> right

that's<00:00:28.109> probably<00:00:28.439> my<00:00:28.590> favorite<00:00:28.949> ride<00:00:29.460> mic

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
that's probably my favorite ride mic

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.209 
that's probably my favorite ride mic
because<00:00:30.150> it<00:00:30.420> really<00:00:30.750> helps<00:00:31.109> bring<00:00:31.949> up<00:00:32.070> the

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
because it really helps bring up the

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:33.860 
because it really helps bring up the
shimmer<00:00:32.460> of<00:00:32.579> the<00:00:32.669> ride<00:00:32.940> without<00:00:33.420> sounding

shimmer of the ride without sounding
harsh<00:00:34.550> like<00:00:35.550> a<00:00:35.579> lot<00:00:35.820> of<00:00:35.969> small<00:00:36.180> diaphragms<00:00:36.660> do

it<00:00:37.680> also<00:00:37.829> works<00:00:38.070> great<00:00:38.129> for<00:00:38.309> high<00:00:38.550> hats<00:00:39.590> stereo

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590

it is a condenser microphone

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.110 
it is a condenser microphone
it<00:00:46.559> does<00:00:46.770> require<00:00:46.980> phantom<00:00:47.399> power<00:00:47.700> from<00:00:47.969> the

mic<00:00:54.570> is<00:00:54.750> very<00:00:55.230> very<00:00:55.530> thin<00:00:55.829> microns<00:00:56.370> thick

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
mic is very very thin microns thick

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.580 
mic is very very thin microns thick
smaller<00:00:57.059> than<00:00:57.270> the<00:00:57.449> blade<00:00:57.780> of<00:00:57.870> hair<00:00:58.079> actually

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
smaller than the blade of hair actually

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.889 
smaller than the blade of hair actually
and<00:00:58.770> because<00:00:58.879> of<00:00:59.879> that<00:01:00.000> the<00:01:00.239> output<00:01:00.690> of<00:01:00.719> the

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
and because of that the output of the

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.500 
and because of that the output of the
capsule<00:01:01.320> is<00:01:01.469> very<00:01:01.770> very<00:01:02.070> low<00:01:02.309> so<00:01:02.579> that<00:01:03.030> power

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
capsule is very very low so that power

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.750 
capsule is very very low so that power
powers<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:04.530> internal<00:01:05.010> preamp<00:01:05.430> in<00:01:05.610> this

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
powers the internal preamp in this

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.030 
powers the internal preamp in this
getting<00:01:06.119> it<00:01:06.330> to<00:01:06.570> just<00:01:07.020> a<00:01:07.140> microphone<00:01:07.530> level

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
getting it to just a microphone level

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.100 
getting it to just a microphone level
terrific<00:01:08.820> a<00:01:09.000> couple<00:01:09.299> of<00:01:09.360> other<00:01:09.450> cool<00:01:09.659> features

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
terrific a couple of other cool features

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.640 
terrific a couple of other cool features
on<00:01:10.140> it<00:01:10.409> it<00:01:10.890> has<00:01:11.100> a<00:01:11.130> 10<00:01:11.939> DB<00:01:12.060> pad<00:01:12.479> so<00:01:13.260> if<00:01:13.380> you<00:01:13.500> do

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
on it it has a 10 DB pad so if you do

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.320 
on it it has a 10 DB pad so if you do
have<00:01:13.830> a<00:01:13.860> really<00:01:14.100> loud<00:01:14.250> source<00:01:14.580> like<00:01:14.820> a<00:01:14.850> symbol

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
have a really loud source like a symbol

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.450 
have a really loud source like a symbol
for<00:01:15.479> example<00:01:15.960> you<00:01:16.560> can<00:01:16.710> Pat<00:01:16.950> it<00:01:17.100> down<00:01:17.250> so

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
for example you can Pat it down so

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:18.710 
for example you can Pat it down so
you're<00:01:17.580> not<00:01:17.610> clipping<00:01:18.060> your<00:01:18.150> preamp

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
you're not clipping your preamp

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.249 
you're not clipping your preamp
it<00:01:18.990> also<00:01:19.409> has<00:01:19.740> a<00:01:19.770> three-position<00:01:20.700> roll-off<00:01:21.259> so

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
it also has a three-position roll-off so

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:23.510 
it also has a three-position roll-off so
you<00:01:22.380> can<00:01:22.530> roll<00:01:22.950> off<00:01:23.130> some<00:01:23.400> of<00:01:23.430> the

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
you can roll off some of the

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.060 
you can roll off some of the
low-frequency<00:01:24.180> noise<00:01:24.600> from<00:01:25.439> either<00:01:25.830> the

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
low-frequency noise from either the

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.569 
low-frequency noise from either the
stand<00:01:26.720> or<00:01:27.720> AC<00:01:27.930> any<00:01:28.770> sort<00:01:28.979> of<00:01:29.009> Rumble<00:01:29.310> you<00:01:29.340> might

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
stand or AC any sort of Rumble you might

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.069 
stand or AC any sort of Rumble you might
get<00:01:29.850> if<00:01:30.060> you're<00:01:30.180> not<00:01:30.329> using<00:01:30.509> a<00:01:30.689> shock<00:01:30.900> mount

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
get if you're not using a shock mount

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.230 
get if you're not using a shock mount
with<00:01:31.290> it<00:01:31.439> so<00:01:31.740> depending<00:01:32.520> on<00:01:32.579> the<00:01:32.700> violence<00:01:33.090> on

with it so depending on the violence on
the<00:01:33.360> stage<00:01:33.659> absolutely<00:01:34.560> gotcha<00:01:35.100> that's<00:01:35.460> you

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
the stage absolutely gotcha that's you

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.310 
the stage absolutely gotcha that's you
so<00:01:35.909> the<00:01:36.030> estimating<00:01:36.270> one<00:01:36.630> includes<00:01:36.990> a<00:01:37.110> nice
