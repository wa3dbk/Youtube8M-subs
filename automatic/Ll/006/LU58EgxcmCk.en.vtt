00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:43.089 
point this these are solid colors

00:00:43.089 --> 00:00:45.160 
point this these are solid colors
because<00:00:44.089> I'm<00:00:44.210> working<00:00:44.359> such<00:00:44.690> an<00:00:44.809> area<00:00:44.960> of<00:00:45.079> this

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:45.170 
because I'm working such an area of this

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:47.649 
because I'm working such an area of this
big<00:00:45.469> you'd<00:00:46.100> end<00:00:46.280> up<00:00:46.399> with<00:00:46.460> lap<00:00:46.789> lines<00:00:47.089> and<00:00:47.359> we

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:47.659 
big you'd end up with lap lines and we

00:00:47.659 --> 00:00:49.689 
big you'd end up with lap lines and we
don't<00:00:47.809> want<00:00:47.960> to<00:00:48.019> end<00:00:48.109> up<00:00:48.199> with<00:00:48.289> lap<00:00:48.469> lines<00:00:48.739> too

00:00:49.689 --> 00:00:49.699 
don't want to end up with lap lines too

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:51.489 
don't want to end up with lap lines too
hard<00:00:49.969> to<00:00:50.089> deal<00:00:50.239> with<00:00:50.300> so<00:00:50.690> this<00:00:50.899> this<00:00:51.199> way<00:00:51.350> we

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:51.499 
hard to deal with so this this way we

00:00:51.499 --> 00:00:52.959 
hard to deal with so this this way we
can<00:00:51.620> go<00:00:51.679> back<00:00:51.859> over<00:00:52.069> it<00:00:52.280> if<00:00:52.370> we<00:00:52.460> have<00:00:52.550> an<00:00:52.639> area

00:00:52.959 --> 00:00:52.969 
can go back over it if we have an area

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:55.329 
can go back over it if we have an area
that<00:00:52.999> we<00:00:53.149> don't<00:00:53.179> like<00:00:53.679> it's<00:00:54.679> not<00:00:54.859> a<00:00:54.889> problem<00:00:55.190> at

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:55.339 
that we don't like it's not a problem at

00:00:55.339 --> 00:00:55.689

a second here's the roller tray on the
left-hand<00:01:18.829> side<00:01:19.070> we<00:01:19.189> have<00:01:19.280> the<00:01:19.369> darker<00:01:19.700> color

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880

left-hand side we have the darker color
on<00:01:20.119> the<00:01:20.420> right-hand<00:01:21.109> side<00:01:21.350> we<00:01:21.590> have<00:01:21.770> the

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:22.299 
on the right-hand side we have the

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:24.789 
on the right-hand side we have the
lighter<00:01:23.299> color<00:01:23.570> and<00:01:23.780> then<00:01:24.079> I<00:01:24.109> just<00:01:24.350> rolled<00:01:24.740> the

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:24.799 
lighter color and then I just rolled the

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:26.649 
lighter color and then I just rolled the
roller<00:01:25.039> into<00:01:25.280> it<00:01:25.460> keeping<00:01:26.060> them<00:01:26.180> sort<00:01:26.539> of

00:01:29.139 --> 00:01:29.149 
separate so you get some on each side of

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:32.230 
separate so you get some on each side of
the<00:01:29.299> roller<00:01:29.500> now<00:01:30.500> you<00:01:30.829> like<00:01:31.130> I<00:01:31.219> was<00:01:31.340> saying<00:01:31.549> our

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 
finished turned out a little bit red to

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:35.620 
finished turned out a little bit red to
red<00:01:34.280> for<00:01:34.429> my<00:01:34.549> liking<00:01:34.759> so<00:01:35.060> I<00:01:35.090> took<00:01:35.149> some<00:01:35.450> glaze

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630 
red for my liking so I took some glaze

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:37.959 
red for my liking so I took some glaze
this<00:01:36.409> stays<00:01:36.619> clear<00:01:36.890> from<00:01:37.070> Benjamin<00:01:37.399> Moore<00:01:37.429> and

00:01:37.959 --> 00:01:37.969 
this stays clear from Benjamin Moore and

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:40.630 
this stays clear from Benjamin Moore and
I<00:01:38.229> put<00:01:39.229> a<00:01:39.259> little<00:01:39.380> bit<00:01:39.590> of<00:01:39.679> tint<00:01:39.920> in<00:01:40.039> it<00:01:40.189> and<00:01:40.340> a

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:40.640 
I put a little bit of tint in it and a

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.029 
I put a little bit of tint in it and a
little<00:01:40.789> bit<00:01:40.939> of<00:01:41.119> white<00:01:41.240> paint<00:01:41.509> and<00:01:42.140> it's<00:01:42.859> not

00:01:43.029 --> 00:01:43.039 
little bit of white paint and it's not

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:45.039 
little bit of white paint and it's not
very<00:01:43.460> powerful<00:01:43.729> but<00:01:44.149> just<00:01:44.299> enough<00:01:44.509> yellow<00:01:44.840> in

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:45.049 
very powerful but just enough yellow in

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:46.389 
very powerful but just enough yellow in
there<00:01:45.229> that<00:01:45.380> it<00:01:45.469> would<00:01:45.560> kick<00:01:45.770> it<00:01:45.890> over<00:01:46.159> and

00:01:46.389 --> 00:01:46.399 
there that it would kick it over and

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:48.249 
there that it would kick it over and
warm<00:01:46.609> up<00:01:46.759> the<00:01:46.909> surface<00:01:47.270> even<00:01:47.719> I<00:01:47.899> can<00:01:48.109> make

00:01:48.249 --> 00:01:48.259 
warm up the surface even I can make

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:50.410 
warm up the surface even I can make
mistakes<00:01:48.619> so<00:01:49.310> this<00:01:49.460> is<00:01:49.579> what<00:01:49.700> I<00:01:49.729> did<00:01:49.939> to<00:01:50.060> fix<00:01:50.210> it

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:50.420 
mistakes so this is what I did to fix it

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.440 
mistakes so this is what I did to fix it
so<00:01:51.409> I<00:01:51.439> took<00:01:51.619> the<00:01:51.829> glaze<00:01:52.149> added<00:01:53.149> some<00:01:53.299> of<00:01:53.390> the

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 
so I took the glaze added some of the

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:57.340 
so I took the glaze added some of the
PTC<00:01:53.960> raw<00:01:54.259> umber<00:01:54.439> and<00:01:54.740> burnt<00:01:55.130> umber<00:01:55.340> and<00:01:56.350> then

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:57.350 
PTC raw umber and burnt umber and then

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.010 
PTC raw umber and burnt umber and then
we<00:01:57.469> added<00:01:57.740> just<00:01:57.859> a<00:01:58.039> little<00:01:58.429> bit<00:01:58.579> of<00:01:58.759> white<00:01:59.479> just

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020 
we added just a little bit of white just

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.830 
we added just a little bit of white just
to<00:02:00.170> give<00:02:00.289> it<00:02:00.380> a<00:02:00.409> little<00:02:00.560> body<00:02:00.829> and<00:02:01.659> mixed<00:02:02.659> it<00:02:02.780> up

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:02.840 
to give it a little body and mixed it up

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.959 
to give it a little body and mixed it up
and<00:02:03.200> in<00:02:03.710> the<00:02:03.799> next<00:02:03.979> scene<00:02:04.369> you'll<00:02:04.579> see<00:02:04.759> that<00:02:04.909> I

00:02:04.959 --> 00:02:04.969 
and in the next scene you'll see that I

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:06.609 
and in the next scene you'll see that I
have<00:02:05.090> that<00:02:05.390> applied<00:02:05.689> you<00:02:06.109> can<00:02:06.140> see<00:02:06.380> how<00:02:06.439> that

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:06.619 
have that applied you can see how that

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:07.989 
have that applied you can see how that
warmed<00:02:06.859> up<00:02:07.009> the<00:02:07.130> wall<00:02:07.310> changed<00:02:07.880> it

00:02:07.989 --> 00:02:07.999 
warmed up the wall changed it

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:09.969 
warmed up the wall changed it
dramatically<00:02:08.660> so<00:02:08.929> it's<00:02:09.080> got<00:02:09.229> that<00:02:09.350> sort<00:02:09.890> of

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 
dramatically so it's got that sort of

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:10.999 
dramatically so it's got that sort of
ties<00:02:10.160> in<00:02:10.369> with<00:02:10.460> the<00:02:10.580> wall<00:02:10.700> that<00:02:10.850> you

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
ties in with the wall that you

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.940 
ties in with the wall that you
on<00:02:11.159> the<00:02:11.220> right<00:02:12.140> next<00:02:13.140> thing<00:02:13.260> I<00:02:13.379> had<00:02:13.530> to<00:02:13.620> do<00:02:13.739> is

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
on the right next thing I had to do is

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.819 
on the right next thing I had to do is
mark<00:02:14.790> out<00:02:14.970> the<00:02:15.510> pattern<00:02:15.930> in<00:02:16.079> this<00:02:16.379> case<00:02:16.620> we're

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:16.829 
mark out the pattern in this case we're

00:02:16.829 --> 00:02:18.140 
mark out the pattern in this case we're
going<00:02:16.920> to<00:02:16.980> do<00:02:17.099> the<00:02:17.250> diamond<00:02:17.579> pattern<00:02:17.760> like<00:02:18.060> you

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
going to do the diamond pattern like you

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.979 
going to do the diamond pattern like you
saw<00:02:18.360> and<00:02:19.260> we're<00:02:20.220> going<00:02:20.340> to<00:02:20.370> fit<00:02:20.579> four<00:02:21.000> for<00:02:21.810> them

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:21.989 
saw and we're going to fit four for them

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:24.440 
saw and we're going to fit four for them
across<00:02:22.170> the<00:02:22.409> wall<00:02:22.590> and<00:02:23.250> it<00:02:24.090> takes<00:02:24.269> a<00:02:24.329> little

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
across the wall and it takes a little

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:25.910 
across the wall and it takes a little
time<00:02:24.569> to<00:02:24.870> do<00:02:24.989> this<00:02:25.140> and<00:02:25.379> of<00:02:25.409> course<00:02:25.470> if<00:02:25.829> you

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
time to do this and of course if you

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.170 
time to do this and of course if you
have<00:02:26.069> someone<00:02:26.370> that<00:02:26.430> can<00:02:26.579> hold<00:02:26.819> the<00:02:26.970> end<00:02:27.090> of

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
have someone that can hold the end of

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
have someone that can hold the end of
the<00:02:27.239> tape<00:02:27.420> measure<00:02:27.450> as<00:02:27.840> you're<00:02:27.989> going<00:02:28.079> to<00:02:28.140> see

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
the tape measure as you're going to see

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.100 
the tape measure as you're going to see
here<00:02:28.500> in<00:02:28.560> a<00:02:28.620> second<00:02:29.069> makes<00:02:29.310> it<00:02:29.459> a<00:02:29.519> lot<00:02:29.760> easier

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
here in a second makes it a lot easier

on there the stays clear from Benjamin

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.020 
on there the stays clear from Benjamin
Moore<00:02:58.260> which<00:02:58.560> is<00:02:58.709> just<00:02:59.220> a<00:02:59.280> clear<00:02:59.489> glaze<00:02:59.700> and

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:06.470 
other video this will seal up the edge
of<00:03:04.980> the<00:03:05.040> tape<00:03:05.220> so<00:03:05.430> any<00:03:05.579> bleeding<00:03:05.909> that's<00:03:06.239> done

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
of the tape so any bleeding that's done

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.890 
of the tape so any bleeding that's done
is<00:03:07.049> done<00:03:07.409> by<00:03:07.680> the<00:03:07.739> clear<00:03:08.250> medium<00:03:08.760> and<00:03:09.000> so<00:03:09.720> your

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
is done by the clear medium and so your

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.149 
is done by the clear medium and so your
lines<00:03:10.079> are<00:03:10.260> perfectly<00:03:10.680> straight<00:03:11.010> and

00:03:11.149 --> 00:03:11.159 
lines are perfectly straight and

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:14.080 
lines are perfectly straight and
perfectly<00:03:12.000> sharp<00:03:12.299> which<00:03:12.659> is<00:03:12.690> very<00:03:13.049> nice

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.090 
perfectly sharp which is very nice

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:16.909 
perfectly sharp which is very nice
alright<00:03:15.090> now<00:03:15.269> I<00:03:15.299> mixed<00:03:15.599> up<00:03:15.660> my<00:03:15.810> tint<00:03:16.139> or<00:03:16.739> my

00:03:16.909 --> 00:03:16.919 
alright now I mixed up my tint or my

00:03:16.919 --> 00:03:20.300 
alright now I mixed up my tint or my
toner<00:03:17.220> with<00:03:17.970> some<00:03:18.180> tints<00:03:18.510> and<00:03:18.709> and<00:03:19.709> I<00:03:19.980> made<00:03:20.160> it

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
toner with some tints and and I made it

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:21.680 
toner with some tints and and I made it
fairly<00:03:20.519> weak<00:03:20.760> and<00:03:20.970> you<00:03:21.030> can<00:03:21.150> see<00:03:21.299> the<00:03:21.419> ones<00:03:21.540> on

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
fairly weak and you can see the ones on

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:23.619 
fairly weak and you can see the ones on
the<00:03:21.780> Left<00:03:21.959> I've<00:03:22.109> already<00:03:22.349> done<00:03:22.530> one<00:03:22.799> pass<00:03:23.040> and

00:03:23.619 --> 00:03:23.629 
the Left I've already done one pass and

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:26.180 
the Left I've already done one pass and
I<00:03:24.629> decided<00:03:25.139> it<00:03:25.349> wasn't<00:03:25.500> quite<00:03:25.739> strong<00:03:25.980> enough

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
I decided it wasn't quite strong enough

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:28.250 
I decided it wasn't quite strong enough
so<00:03:26.340> I<00:03:26.400> did<00:03:26.549> a<00:03:26.609> second<00:03:26.970> pass<00:03:27.120> now<00:03:28.019> the<00:03:28.079> nice

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
so I did a second pass now the nice

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.470 
so I did a second pass now the nice
thing<00:03:28.290> about<00:03:28.500> this<00:03:28.769> is<00:03:29.010> if<00:03:29.220> you<00:03:29.459> go<00:03:29.760> too<00:03:30.120> strong

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
thing about this is if you go too strong

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:33.050 
thing about this is if you go too strong
too<00:03:30.810> fast<00:03:30.840> too<00:03:31.349> quick<00:03:31.620> your<00:03:32.370> pooch<00:03:32.609> you're

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
too fast too quick your pooch you're

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:36.259 
too fast too quick your pooch you're
done<00:03:33.269> and<00:03:33.530> by<00:03:34.530> going<00:03:34.889> lighter<00:03:35.160> you<00:03:35.849> can<00:03:36.030> creep

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:36.269 
done and by going lighter you can creep

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:38.990 
done and by going lighter you can creep
up<00:03:36.449> on<00:03:36.599> the<00:03:37.199> the<00:03:38.099> finish<00:03:38.370> you're<00:03:38.489> looking<00:03:38.760> for

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
up on the the finish you're looking for

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.240 
up on the the finish you're looking for
and<00:03:39.660> it<00:03:40.349> just<00:03:40.379> gives<00:03:40.739> you<00:03:40.829> a<00:03:40.859> little<00:03:40.980> wiggle

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
and it just gives you a little wiggle

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.520 
and it just gives you a little wiggle
room<00:03:41.489> so<00:03:41.849> you<00:03:41.940> can<00:03:42.060> go<00:03:42.150> a<00:03:42.180> little<00:03:42.389> more<00:03:42.569> it's

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
room so you can go a little more it's

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:44.900 
room so you can go a little more it's
hard<00:03:43.680> to<00:03:43.799> go<00:03:43.889> less<00:03:44.099> but<00:03:44.400> you<00:03:44.489> can<00:03:44.579> always<00:03:44.669> go<00:03:44.879> a

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:44.910 
hard to go less but you can always go a

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:47.930 
hard to go less but you can always go a
little<00:03:45.030> more<00:03:46.010> roll<00:03:47.010> on<00:03:47.220> this<00:03:47.430> stuff<00:03:47.669> and<00:03:47.879> I

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
little more roll on this stuff and I

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:51.740 
little more roll on this stuff and I
used<00:03:48.120> to<00:03:48.180> give<00:03:48.359> the<00:03:48.540> whiz<00:03:48.989> roller<00:03:49.290> to<00:03:50.599> put<00:03:51.599> that

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
used to give the whiz roller to put that

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:54.530 
used to give the whiz roller to put that
on<00:03:51.959> and<00:03:52.379> and<00:03:52.829> in<00:03:53.639> applying<00:03:54.030> it<00:03:54.150> with<00:03:54.239> the<00:03:54.299> Riz

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
on and and in applying it with the Riz

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.330 
on and and in applying it with the Riz
roller<00:03:54.810> you<00:03:55.500> get<00:03:55.739> a<00:03:55.769> little<00:03:56.010> more<00:03:56.159> of<00:03:56.310> that

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 
roller you get a little more of that

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:58.159 
roller you get a little more of that
mottled<00:03:57.180> look<00:03:57.239> whereas<00:03:57.599> if<00:03:57.720> you<00:03:57.810> had<00:03:57.930> a<00:03:57.959> big

00:03:58.159 --> 00:03:58.169 
mottled look whereas if you had a big

00:03:58.169 --> 00:03:59.599 
mottled look whereas if you had a big
roll<00:03:58.409> or<00:03:58.590> in<00:03:58.709> a<00:03:58.769> cutting<00:03:58.980> brush<00:03:59.220> it<00:03:59.400> wouldn't

00:03:59.599 --> 00:03:59.609 
roll or in a cutting brush it wouldn't

00:03:59.609 --> 00:04:02.119 
roll or in a cutting brush it wouldn't
be<00:03:59.760> quite<00:04:00.030> as<00:04:00.060> nice<00:04:00.590> time<00:04:01.590> to<00:04:01.739> pull<00:04:01.889> off<00:04:02.010> the

00:04:02.119 --> 00:04:02.129 
be quite as nice time to pull off the

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:03.740 
be quite as nice time to pull off the
tape<00:04:02.280> make<00:04:02.519> sure<00:04:02.760> you<00:04:02.879> let<00:04:03.000> everything<00:04:03.359> dry

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
tape make sure you let everything dry

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:07.759 
tape make sure you let everything dry
completely<00:04:04.819> if<00:04:05.819> it's<00:04:06.480> not<00:04:06.659> entirely<00:04:06.989> dry<00:04:07.409> then

00:04:07.759 --> 00:04:07.769 
completely if it's not entirely dry then

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:08.750 
completely if it's not entirely dry then
when<00:04:07.859> you<00:04:07.949> go<00:04:08.010> to<00:04:08.069> pull<00:04:08.220> the<00:04:08.310> tape<00:04:08.489> off<00:04:08.609> you

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
when you go to pull the tape off you

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:10.009 
when you go to pull the tape off you
might<00:04:08.879> have<00:04:09.030> some<00:04:09.180> bridging<00:04:09.599> between<00:04:09.629> the

00:04:10.009 --> 00:04:10.019 
might have some bridging between the

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:12.439 
might have some bridging between the
paint<00:04:10.530> and<00:04:10.739> the<00:04:11.040> tape<00:04:11.250> and<00:04:12.000> it<00:04:12.090> might<00:04:12.239> end<00:04:12.269> up

00:04:12.439 --> 00:04:12.449 
paint and the tape and it might end up

00:04:12.449 --> 00:04:13.899 
paint and the tape and it might end up
pulling<00:04:12.659> some<00:04:12.900> of<00:04:12.930> it<00:04:13.109> off

00:04:13.899 --> 00:04:13.909 
pulling some of it off

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:17.810 
pulling some of it off
so<00:04:14.909> we'll<00:04:15.299> take<00:04:15.569> off<00:04:15.750> the<00:04:15.780> tape<00:04:16.169> and<00:04:16.579> that<00:04:17.579> will

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:17.820 
so we'll take off the tape and that will

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:20.759 
so we'll take off the tape and that will
reveal<00:04:18.150> our<00:04:18.539> nice<00:04:18.840> little<00:04:19.019> finish

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:20.769 
reveal our nice little finish

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:22.960 
reveal our nice little finish
and<00:04:21.769> you<00:04:21.890> can<00:04:21.980> see<00:04:22.100> how<00:04:22.160> that<00:04:22.340> yellow<00:04:22.730> toner

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:22.970 
and you can see how that yellow toner

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:24.520 
and you can see how that yellow toner
that<00:04:23.210> I<00:04:23.240> put<00:04:23.450> on<00:04:23.540> earlier<00:04:23.870> helps<00:04:24.110> marry<00:04:24.380> the

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:24.530 
that I put on earlier helps marry the

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:27.820 
that I put on earlier helps marry the
two<00:04:24.680> of<00:04:24.770> them<00:04:24.890> together<00:04:26.230> this<00:04:27.230> really<00:04:27.530> changed

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:27.830 
two of them together this really changed

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:29.410 
two of them together this really changed
the<00:04:27.920> look<00:04:28.010> of<00:04:28.130> this<00:04:28.280> room<00:04:28.520> the<00:04:28.940> guy<00:04:29.090> who<00:04:29.150> owned

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:29.420 
the look of this room the guy who owned

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:30.820 
the look of this room the guy who owned
this<00:04:29.540> place<00:04:29.780> he<00:04:29.900> just<00:04:30.110> wanted<00:04:30.320> something<00:04:30.530> just

to just to spruce it up a little bit and

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:34.960 
to just to spruce it up a little bit and
altogether<00:04:33.440> this<00:04:33.650> took<00:04:33.890> only<00:04:34.190> I<00:04:34.400> would<00:04:34.850> say

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:34.970 
altogether this took only I would say

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:38.410 
altogether this took only I would say
three<00:04:35.210> hours<00:04:35.510> start<00:04:35.810> to<00:04:35.900> finish<00:04:36.050> so<00:04:37.330> don't<00:04:38.330> be
