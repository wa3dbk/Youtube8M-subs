00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:14.530
 my son nine months of dreaming about your 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:18.460
 mother 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:23.230
 and although always young little by little 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:26.230
 and with love we learned to be parents 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:29.650
 deal with your tantrums to change 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:33.760
 the diapers or to get up at night 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:36.550
 sir and that you make an offering then 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:38.170
 your teeth came and the scare of 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:41.500
 some fever 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:44.980
 but how beautiful it was to see you rest with 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:49.629

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:52.960
 legs and you saw your first steps with 

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:57.850
 tears in the eyes I saw you finally 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:01:01.239

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:04.699
 I see you grown up I feel very proud 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:08.539
 the time we share 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:13.009
 I reflect in your look that encourages me 

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:15.950
 every day and clinging to your smile I go out to 

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:19.130
 fight to life 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:22.759
 and I go out to earn my bread and although 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:27.649

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:30.970

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:34.460

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:59.600
 star that always guide your steps 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:01.980
