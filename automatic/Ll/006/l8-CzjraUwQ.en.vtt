underneath the couch there here's the
inverter<00:02:00.290> basically<00:02:01.290> take<00:02:02.040> my<00:02:02.190> 120<00:02:02.700> converts

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
inverter basically take my 120 converts

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.840 
inverter basically take my 120 converts
it<00:02:03.150> to<00:02:03.180> 12<00:02:03.480> volts<00:02:03.750> for<00:02:03.870> everything

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:04.850 
it to 12 volts for everything

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:07.930 
it to 12 volts for everything
actually<00:02:05.850> I<00:02:05.910> added<00:02:06.090> this<00:02:06.180> 12<00:02:07.080> volt<00:02:07.140> connector

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:07.940 
actually I added this 12 volt connector

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:10.520 
actually I added this 12 volt connector
to<00:02:08.940> charge<00:02:09.210> like<00:02:09.360> cellphones<00:02:09.810> and<00:02:10.080> stuff<00:02:10.290> or

to charge like cellphones and stuff or
anything<00:02:10.890> at<00:02:11.070> 12<00:02:11.310> volts<00:02:12.380> it's<00:02:13.380> actually<00:02:13.680> a

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
anything at 12 volts it's actually a

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.070 
anything at 12 volts it's actually a
cable<00:02:14.490> cable<00:02:15.300> connector<00:02:15.750> if<00:02:15.840> you<00:02:15.900> go<00:02:15.960> to<00:02:16.020> a
