00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:10.250
 hello everyone with you spoon and today we 

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:12.200
 we will consider two mods and all these 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:15.559
 two fashion will be different from others 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:18.170
 the simple fact that these mods generate 

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:21.380
 but openid let's see first 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:24.080
 The first mod is different from 2 in that it 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:26.600
 generates the waters of the world but in the second mode we 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:28.340
 We already know what generates and two worlds from 

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:31.340
 we get de strongly 2d 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:35.510
 with only a resolution of 2 blocks walk 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:37.850
 well, of course, his width is enough 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:39.980
 huge but rather infinite we can 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:41.780
 as usual to chop trees as usual 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:43.880
 walk but we can't jump all the same 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:45.010
 as we would not even have tried and 

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:48.380
 using any 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:50.570
 bugs or mods or even cheats in general, even we 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:52.430
 still not able to quit everything happens 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:55.750
 here just like minecraft but how 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:59.059
 I already said we can't get out 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:00.620
 width is more than two blocks we all also 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:03.410
 can craft all chests and crafting 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.940
 just as there is no crafting mod 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:07.220
 new does not add that is, we also all 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:09.800
 We can insert all we can also ruin 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:11.569
 can also mine and hawaii fallin and 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.640
 You see, we can even see 

00:01:11.569 --> 00:01:17.420
 all ore is of course a little 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:19.009
 a little cheat but I mod with 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:21.590
 at first glance even liked 

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:24.470
 really cool mod well, we 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:26.360
 proceed to the next fashion and the second mode 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:28.190
 called the biosphere I will say right away he 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:30.289
 clashes with 2d craft that is 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:30.979
 see me now not installed 2d 

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:32.780
 world 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:35.990
 but because as I said they 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.590
 conflict also for 2d world not needed 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:39.470
 modloader 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:42.440
 they conflict with them about the biosphere 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:45.020
 on the contrary, you need to wise and let's all 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:47.539
 we will create a new world 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:50.270
 Now that we have generated and we 

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:53.630
 now we can find in the simple world from 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:56.140
 or any other biomes such as 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:02:00.289
 mushroom plain plains winter biomes and 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:02.569
 as you already understood we are in the dome 

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:05.929
 that is, now all biomes are connected 

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:08.090
 with domes and such bridges here I am not 

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:10.310
 I know it is cool it seems to me that it is 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:13.610
 cool enough but to find 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:15.500
 some ore were not advise it here 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.090
 in this big dome first we have to 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.340
 burrow 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.629
 a little bit of a little bit of a little land and then go here 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.879
 this dome as you probably already noticed 

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:23.980
 out there so you can see the diamond's 

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:26.140
 small domes mean something 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:28.750
 there are very very good resources and 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:29.980
 so I advise you to go there immediately 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.140
 after you have appeared 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:34.930
 some kind of stone alterg 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:37.390
 Well, in general, that's all 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:39.459
 yes everything and if you liked it 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:41.290
 like to call friends or 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:42.940
 Subscribe by the way I want to immediately say something 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:45.730
 that there were no shaders in this release 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:49.120
 because they conflict these mods 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:53.160
 each other still have a plan with you 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.160
 there was a spoon everybody good luck everybody
