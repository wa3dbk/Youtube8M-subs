00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.350 

I<00:00:00.060> guess<00:00:01.610> analytically<00:00:02.610> speaking<00:00:03.030> to<00:00:03.149> make

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:03.360 
I guess analytically speaking to make

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:05.030 
I guess analytically speaking to make
the<00:00:03.510> first<00:00:03.540> nine<00:00:03.929> 3-pointers<00:00:04.650> it's<00:00:04.859> got<00:00:05.009> a

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:05.040 
the first nine 3-pointers it's got a

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.190 
the first nine 3-pointers it's got a
foot<00:00:05.279> to<00:00:05.430> make<00:00:06.000> it<00:00:06.120> pretty<00:00:06.299> happy<00:00:06.480> the<00:00:06.930> start

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
foot to make it pretty happy the start

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.040 
foot to make it pretty happy the start
