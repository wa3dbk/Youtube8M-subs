regular<00:05:09.330> madden<00:05:09.630> play<00:05:09.750> we<00:05:09.900> would<00:05:10.050> never<00:05:10.230> play

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:10.590 
regular madden play we would never play

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:14.420 
regular madden play we would never play
a<00:05:11.780> you<00:05:12.780> know<00:05:12.900> a<00:05:12.930> player<00:05:13.290> out<00:05:13.560> of<00:05:13.590> position<00:05:13.860> like

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:14.430 
a you know a player out of position like

a you know a player out of position like
that<00:05:14.460> you<00:05:14.850> know<00:05:14.880> tackles<00:05:15.390> can<00:05:15.600> play<00:05:15.780> tight<00:05:16.020> end

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:16.200 
that you know tackles can play tight end

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:18.080 
that you know tackles can play tight end
so<00:05:16.320> Donald<00:05:16.710> Payne<00:05:16.830> can<00:05:17.370> actually<00:05:17.700> play<00:05:17.850> tight

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:18.090 
so Donald Payne can actually play tight

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:20.300 
so Donald Payne can actually play tight
end<00:05:18.300> however<00:05:18.510> you<00:05:19.380> will<00:05:19.560> never<00:05:19.800> see<00:05:20.010> a<00:05:20.040> wide
