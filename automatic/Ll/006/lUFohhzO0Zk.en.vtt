active<00:03:10.970> what<00:03:11.629> that<00:03:11.810> means<00:03:12.139> is<00:03:12.379> muscle<00:03:13.069> just

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:13.639 
active what that means is muscle just

00:03:13.639 --> 00:03:15.460 
active what that means is muscle just
sitting<00:03:13.970> on<00:03:14.090> your<00:03:14.150> body<00:03:14.599> burns<00:03:15.319> calories

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:15.470 
sitting on your body burns calories

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:17.649 
sitting on your body burns calories
that's<00:03:16.400> why<00:03:16.519> the<00:03:16.579> people<00:03:17.000> who<00:03:17.090> are<00:03:17.209> tend<00:03:17.450> to<00:03:17.540> be

00:03:17.649 --> 00:03:17.659 
that's why the people who are tend to be

00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:19.569 
that's why the people who are tend to be
a<00:03:17.690> little<00:03:18.019> more<00:03:18.139> muscular<00:03:18.560> genetically<00:03:19.280> they

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:19.579 
a little more muscular genetically they

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:21.009 
a little more muscular genetically they
tend<00:03:19.849> to<00:03:19.879> eat<00:03:20.060> whatever<00:03:20.239> they<00:03:20.540> want<00:03:20.870> they

00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:21.019 
tend to eat whatever they want they

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:23.229 
tend to eat whatever they want they
still<00:03:21.319> stay<00:03:21.530> lean<00:03:21.829> it's<00:03:22.310> because<00:03:22.730> that<00:03:22.879> muscle

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:23.239 
still stay lean it's because that muscle

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:25.629 
still stay lean it's because that muscle
is<00:03:23.510> like<00:03:23.720> it's<00:03:24.440> like<00:03:24.620> heat<00:03:24.919> in<00:03:25.069> your<00:03:25.099> body<00:03:25.190> it's

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:25.639 
is like it's like heat in your body it's

00:03:25.639 --> 00:03:27.640 
is like it's like heat in your body it's
always<00:03:26.150> just<00:03:26.389> giving<00:03:26.690> off<00:03:26.840> calories<00:03:27.470> to

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:27.650 
always just giving off calories to

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:30.150 
always just giving off calories to
rebuild<00:03:28.129> and<00:03:28.430> recuperate<00:03:28.970> and<00:03:29.299> it's<00:03:29.750> just

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:30.160 
rebuild and recuperate and it's just

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.439 
rebuild and recuperate and it's just
metabolically<00:03:31.160> active<00:03:31.310> fat<00:03:32.030> on<00:03:32.180> the<00:03:32.299> other

00:03:32.439 --> 00:03:32.449 
metabolically active fat on the other

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:34.449 
metabolically active fat on the other
hand<00:03:32.720> the<00:03:32.840> actual<00:03:33.230> white<00:03:33.470> fat<00:03:33.829> think<00:03:34.160> of<00:03:34.310> a

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:34.459 
hand the actual white fat think of a

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:36.879 
hand the actual white fat think of a
white<00:03:35.090> marble<00:03:35.599> and<00:03:35.690> a<00:03:35.780> steak<00:03:36.109> or<00:03:36.379> shortening

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:36.889 
white marble and a steak or shortening

00:03:36.889 --> 00:03:39.280 
white marble and a steak or shortening
that's<00:03:37.400> actually<00:03:38.090> stagnant<00:03:38.720> it<00:03:38.780> doesn't<00:03:39.109> burn

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:39.290 
that's actually stagnant it doesn't burn

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:41.589 
that's actually stagnant it doesn't burn
any<00:03:39.590> calories<00:03:39.620> so<00:03:40.250> guess<00:03:40.430> what<00:03:40.669> when<00:03:41.180> she<00:03:41.209> lost

00:03:41.589 --> 00:03:41.599 
any calories so guess what when she lost

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:44.140 
any calories so guess what when she lost
weight<00:03:41.930> she<00:03:42.410> lost<00:03:42.620> the<00:03:42.859> fat<00:03:43.129> she<00:03:43.730> lost<00:03:43.910> the

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.150 
weight she lost the fat she lost the

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:45.939 
weight she lost the fat she lost the
muscle<00:03:44.540> tissue<00:03:44.750> and<00:03:45.109> she<00:03:45.319> lost<00:03:45.500> the<00:03:45.709> water

00:03:45.939 --> 00:03:45.949 
muscle tissue and she lost the water

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:48.309 
muscle tissue and she lost the water
great<00:03:46.549> what's<00:03:47.389> wrong<00:03:47.690> with<00:03:47.900> that<00:03:47.959> picture

00:03:48.309 --> 00:03:48.319 
great what's wrong with that picture

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:51.400 
great what's wrong with that picture
well<00:03:49.040> it's<00:03:49.549> very<00:03:49.910> hard<00:03:50.090> to<00:03:50.510> put<00:03:50.690> muscle<00:03:51.139> tissue

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:51.410 
well it's very hard to put muscle tissue

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:53.890 
well it's very hard to put muscle tissue
back<00:03:51.859> on<00:03:52.160> it's<00:03:52.760> very<00:03:53.000> hard<00:03:53.269> to<00:03:53.329> get<00:03:53.540> the<00:03:53.660> body

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:53.900 
back on it's very hard to get the body

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:56.890 
back on it's very hard to get the body
back<00:03:54.199> to<00:03:55.190> that<00:03:55.370> point<00:03:55.639> it<00:03:55.940> was<00:03:56.180> before<00:03:56.449> once

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:56.900 
back to that point it was before once

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:58.780 
back to that point it was before once
you've<00:03:57.079> lost<00:03:57.290> that<00:03:57.500> muscle<00:03:57.709> tissue<00:03:58.040> so<00:03:58.160> when

00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:58.790 
you've lost that muscle tissue so when

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:00.729 
you've lost that muscle tissue so when
she<00:03:58.970> lost<00:03:59.180> the<00:03:59.419> muscle<00:03:59.840> and<00:03:59.989> the<00:04:00.139> water<00:04:00.379> and

00:04:00.729 --> 00:04:00.739 
she lost the muscle and the water and

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:03.309 
she lost the muscle and the water and
the<00:04:00.889> fat<00:04:01.160> now<00:04:01.760> it's<00:04:02.449> gonna<00:04:02.599> be<00:04:02.690> a<00:04:02.840> lot<00:04:03.049> easier

00:04:03.309 --> 00:04:03.319 
the fat now it's gonna be a lot easier

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:06.099 
the fat now it's gonna be a lot easier
for<00:04:03.799> her<00:04:04.099> to<00:04:04.250> replace<00:04:04.699> the<00:04:05.359> muscle<00:04:05.780> that<00:04:05.810> she

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:06.109 
for her to replace the muscle that she

00:04:06.109 --> 00:04:09.670 
for her to replace the muscle that she
lost<00:04:06.319> with<00:04:07.010> body<00:04:07.370> fat<00:04:07.699> so<00:04:08.209> the<00:04:08.419> end<00:04:08.659> result<00:04:09.049> is

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:09.680 
lost with body fat so the end result is

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:11.949 
lost with body fat so the end result is
that<00:04:09.949> she<00:04:10.280> actually<00:04:10.849> ends<00:04:11.120> up<00:04:11.180> storing<00:04:11.690> more

00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:11.959 
that she actually ends up storing more

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:15.240 
that she actually ends up storing more
body<00:04:12.470> fat<00:04:12.889> and<00:04:13.129> having<00:04:13.849> a<00:04:13.970> slower<00:04:14.569> metabolism

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:15.250 
body fat and having a slower metabolism

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:18.550 
body fat and having a slower metabolism
then<00:04:16.250> she<00:04:16.549> started<00:04:16.970> out<00:04:17.120> with<00:04:17.359> this<00:04:17.989> is<00:04:18.260> the

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:18.560 
then she started out with this is the

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:21.159 
then she started out with this is the
whole<00:04:19.030> destructive<00:04:20.030> process<00:04:20.539> of<00:04:20.690> dieting

00:04:21.159 --> 00:04:21.169 
whole destructive process of dieting

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:23.620 
whole destructive process of dieting
this<00:04:21.289> is<00:04:21.409> why<00:04:21.530> people<00:04:21.949> go<00:04:22.370> up<00:04:22.400> and<00:04:22.940> down<00:04:23.300> and

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:23.630 
this is why people go up and down and

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:25.510 
this is why people go up and down and
rebound<00:04:24.139> in<00:04:24.320> weight<00:04:24.500> over<00:04:24.949> and<00:04:25.070> over<00:04:25.370> again

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:25.520 
rebound in weight over and over again

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:27.909 
rebound in weight over and over again
because<00:04:25.880> they<00:04:26.780> don't<00:04:27.050> realize<00:04:27.590> that<00:04:27.620> they've

00:04:27.909 --> 00:04:27.919 
because they don't realize that they've

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:30.650 
because they don't realize that they've
actually<00:04:28.400> slowed<00:04:28.909> their<00:04:29.180> metabolism<00:04:29.960> down

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:30.660 
actually slowed their metabolism down

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:32.390 
actually slowed their metabolism down
through<00:04:30.870> the<00:04:31.080> nutrition<00:04:31.620> and<00:04:31.770> the<00:04:31.830> diet<00:04:32.070> plan

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:32.400 
through the nutrition and the diet plan

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:33.890 
through the nutrition and the diet plan
