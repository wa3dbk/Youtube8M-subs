try<00:01:38.690> to<00:01:38.750> get<00:01:38.960> in<00:01:39.080> well<00:01:39.920> under<00:01:40.160> says<00:01:40.790> you<00:01:41.060> know

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:41.150 
try to get in well under says you know

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:43.210 
try to get in well under says you know
obviously<00:01:41.570> has<00:01:41.750> has<00:01:42.170> a<00:01:42.200> history<00:01:42.590> of<00:01:42.680> struggle

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:43.220 
obviously has has a history of struggle

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:44.800 
obviously has has a history of struggle
from<00:01:43.610> the<00:01:43.670> free-throw<00:01:43.910> line<00:01:44.090> so<00:01:44.450> basically

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:44.810 
from the free-throw line so basically

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.350 
from the free-throw line so basically
we're<00:01:45.080> just<00:01:45.110> all<00:01:45.830> the<00:01:46.160> percentage-wise<00:01:46.880> right

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:47.360 
we're just all the percentage-wise right

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:48.640 
we're just all the percentage-wise right
now<00:01:47.570> you<00:01:47.630> would<00:01:47.810> look<00:01:47.930> say<00:01:48.170> well<00:01:48.380> he<00:01:48.530> hasn't

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:48.650 
now you would look say well he hasn't

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:50.590 
now you would look say well he hasn't
improved<00:01:49.160> the<00:01:49.310> whole<00:01:49.460> lot<00:01:49.610> there<00:01:49.790> if<00:01:50.420> you<00:01:50.570> just

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:50.600 
improved the whole lot there if you just

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.570 
improved the whole lot there if you just
watch<00:01:50.960> his<00:01:51.200> motion<00:01:51.620> and<00:01:51.770> you<00:01:51.860> do<00:01:51.980> the<00:01:52.190> game<00:01:52.400> it

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:52.580 
watch his motion and you do the game it

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:55.510 
watch his motion and you do the game it
looks<00:01:52.760> better<00:01:52.970> my<00:01:53.870> main<00:01:54.110> thing<00:01:54.440> was<00:01:54.740> you<00:01:55.340> got<00:01:55.490> a

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520 
looks better my main thing was you got a

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.460 
looks better my main thing was you got a
walk<00:01:55.940> before<00:01:56.180> you<00:01:56.360> can<00:01:56.510> run<00:01:56.690> and<00:01:57.200> the<00:01:57.290> main

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:57.470 
walk before you can run and the main

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:59.080 
walk before you can run and the main
thing<00:01:57.680> I<00:01:57.740> wanted<00:01:58.190> to<00:01:58.250> do<00:01:58.370> with<00:01:58.520> Honduras<00:01:58.910> was

thing I wanted to do with Honduras was

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:02.440 
thing I wanted to do with Honduras was
to<00:01:59.300> get<00:01:59.510> into<00:01:59.900> to<00:02:00.710> a<00:02:00.740> one<00:02:01.040> motion<00:02:01.490> shot<00:02:01.730> you

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
to get into to a one motion shot you

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:04.060 
to get into to a one motion shot you
know<00:02:02.630> from<00:02:03.170> the<00:02:03.290> line<00:02:03.470> he<00:02:03.740> was<00:02:03.890> pretty

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.070 
know from the line he was pretty

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:07.900 
know from the line he was pretty
disjointed<00:02:05.500> hazop<00:02:06.500> didn't<00:02:06.860> start<00:02:07.160> with<00:02:07.730> his

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:07.910 
disjointed hazop didn't start with his

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:10.389 
disjointed hazop didn't start with his
shot<00:02:08.240> which<00:02:08.479> it<00:02:09.260> just<00:02:09.560> doesn't<00:02:10.010> allow<00:02:10.130> you<00:02:10.280> to

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:10.399 
shot which it just doesn't allow you to

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:12.310 
shot which it just doesn't allow you to
be<00:02:10.550> successful<00:02:10.580> in<00:02:11.209> the<00:02:11.300> long<00:02:11.330> run<00:02:11.750> and<00:02:12.050> I<00:02:12.140> see

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:12.320 
be successful in the long run and I see

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:13.840 
be successful in the long run and I see
it<00:02:12.380> getting<00:02:12.620> up<00:02:12.680> over<00:02:12.830> the<00:02:13.010> rim<00:02:13.190> now<00:02:13.370> it<00:02:13.700> is

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:13.850 
it getting up over the rim now it is

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:15.370 
it getting up over the rim now it is
he's<00:02:14.090> getting<00:02:14.209> it<00:02:14.390> up<00:02:14.510> over<00:02:14.690> the<00:02:14.900> rim<00:02:15.080> are

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
he's getting it up over the rim are

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:17.050 
he's getting it up over the rim are
getting<00:02:15.980> a<00:02:16.040> higher<00:02:16.190> arch<00:02:16.430> on<00:02:16.610> the<00:02:16.700> ball<00:02:16.880> with

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
getting a higher arch on the ball with

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.090 
getting a higher arch on the ball with
something<00:02:17.390> as<00:02:17.480> important<00:02:17.959> as<00:02:18.020> well<00:02:18.260> and<00:02:18.590> and

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100 
something as important as well and and

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:20.949 
something as important as well and and
I'm<00:02:19.220> actually<00:02:19.880> pleased<00:02:20.390> with<00:02:20.660> the<00:02:20.750> progress

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:20.959 
I'm actually pleased with the progress

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:22.570 
I'm actually pleased with the progress
that<00:02:21.200> under<00:02:21.650> sizz<00:02:21.830> made<00:02:22.070> I<00:02:22.100> think<00:02:22.459> you

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:22.580 
that under sizz made I think you

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:23.530 
that under sizz made I think you
definitely<00:02:22.760> heading<00:02:23.240> in<00:02:23.330> the<00:02:23.390> right

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
definitely heading in the right

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.720 
definitely heading in the right
direction<00:02:23.600> and<00:02:24.230> I<00:02:24.350> think<00:02:24.380> if<00:02:24.709> he'll<00:02:24.860> now<00:02:25.370> just

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
direction and I think if he'll now just

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:27.820 
direction and I think if he'll now just
over<00:02:25.970> the<00:02:26.150> summer<00:02:26.450> and<00:02:26.780> after<00:02:27.350> the<00:02:27.470> season's

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
over the summer and after the season's

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:29.890 
over the summer and after the season's
over<00:02:27.950> really<00:02:28.459> take<00:02:28.640> the<00:02:28.790> time<00:02:28.820> and<00:02:29.270> invest<00:02:29.660> in

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
over really take the time and invest in

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:30.190 
over really take the time and invest in
it

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
it

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.170 
it
I<00:02:30.230> think<00:02:30.709> he'll<00:02:30.890> have<00:02:30.920> a<00:02:31.070> chance<00:02:31.100> to<00:02:31.550> see<00:02:32.000> some

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
I think he'll have a chance to see some

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:33.550 
I think he'll have a chance to see some
improvement<00:02:32.660> there<00:02:32.690> would<00:02:33.110> you<00:02:33.230> ever<00:02:33.320> take

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
improvement there would you ever take

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.010 
improvement there would you ever take
what<00:02:34.459> I<00:02:34.490> consider<00:02:34.970> a<00:02:35.209> pretty<00:02:35.570> doggone<00:02:35.959> good

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:36.020 
what I consider a pretty doggone good

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:37.720 
what I consider a pretty doggone good
shooter<00:02:36.440> it's<00:02:36.530> not<00:02:36.650> a<00:02:36.680> great<00:02:36.920> shooter<00:02:37.100> but

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
shooter it's not a great shooter but

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:39.340 
shooter it's not a great shooter but
when<00:02:37.970> you<00:02:38.060> measure<00:02:38.240> him<00:02:38.420> to<00:02:38.510> me<00:02:38.660> I<00:02:38.870> was<00:02:39.200> more

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:39.350 
when you measure him to me I was more

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:41.229 
when you measure him to me I was more
streaky<00:02:39.770> so<00:02:40.220> I<00:02:40.250> could<00:02:40.489> say<00:02:40.610> are<00:02:40.730> you<00:02:40.820> obviously

00:02:41.229 --> 00:02:41.239 
streaky so I could say are you obviously

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:42.070 
streaky so I could say are you obviously
a<00:02:41.269> great<00:02:41.690> shooter

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.080 
a great shooter

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.470 
a great shooter
I<00:02:42.260> consider<00:02:42.920> Steph<00:02:43.160> Curry<00:02:43.400> a<00:02:43.700> great<00:02:44.180> shooter

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
I consider Steph Curry a great shooter

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.720 
I consider Steph Curry a great shooter
would<00:02:45.170> you<00:02:45.290> ever<00:02:45.410> tinker<00:02:46.040> with<00:02:46.160> his<00:02:46.340> game<00:02:46.550> at

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:46.730 
would you ever tinker with his game at

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:48.870 
would you ever tinker with his game at
all<00:02:46.850> and<00:02:47.239> try<00:02:47.390> to<00:02:47.420> make<00:02:47.540> it<00:02:47.750> better<00:02:47.930> or<00:02:48.260> what<00:02:48.620> it

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:48.880 
all and try to make it better or what it

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.040 
all and try to make it better or what it
messed<00:02:49.880> him<00:02:50.030> up<00:02:50.060> a<00:02:50.180> little<00:02:50.330> bit<00:02:50.510> rather<00:02:50.750> than

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:51.050 
messed him up a little bit rather than

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:52.960 
messed him up a little bit rather than
shyness<00:02:51.500> well<00:02:51.950> it's<00:02:52.040> Steph's<00:02:52.459> a<00:02:52.580> guy<00:02:52.730> that<00:02:52.940> I

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:52.970 
shyness well it's Steph's a guy that I

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:54.610 
shyness well it's Steph's a guy that I
would<00:02:53.150> put<00:02:53.269> in<00:02:53.420> that<00:02:53.510> category<00:02:53.720> from<00:02:54.260> from<00:02:54.500> the

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
would put in that category from from the

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:56.830 
would put in that category from from the
upper<00:02:54.890> body<00:02:55.070> up<00:02:55.489> I<00:02:55.850> wouldn't<00:02:56.300> I<00:02:56.420> wouldn't<00:02:56.600> mess

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 
upper body up I wouldn't I wouldn't mess

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.509 
upper body up I wouldn't I wouldn't mess
with<00:02:56.870> him<00:02:57.200> a<00:02:57.230> whole<00:02:57.440> lot<00:02:57.470> he's<00:02:57.860> he's<00:02:58.310> got<00:02:58.459> a

00:02:58.509 --> 00:02:58.519 
with him a whole lot he's he's got a

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:00.610 
with him a whole lot he's he's got a
great<00:02:58.790> release<00:02:59.209> and<00:02:59.540> all<00:02:59.630> those<00:02:59.810> things<00:03:00.110> but<00:03:00.350> I

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
great release and all those things but I

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:02.229 
great release and all those things but I
think<00:03:01.130> there's<00:03:01.310> some<00:03:01.489> some<00:03:01.850> areas

00:03:02.229 --> 00:03:02.239 
think there's some some areas

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:04.570 
think there's some some areas
particularly<00:03:02.840> being<00:03:03.590> a<00:03:03.680> point<00:03:03.860> guard<00:03:04.010> coming

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:04.580 
particularly being a point guard coming

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:06.880 
particularly being a point guard coming
off<00:03:04.670> picking<00:03:05.060> roles<00:03:05.269> setting<00:03:06.260> yourself<00:03:06.650> up

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:06.890 
off picking roles setting yourself up

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.010 
at an alarming rate right as we tape

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:38.650 
at an alarming rate right as we tape
this<00:03:37.040> at<00:03:37.610> around<00:03:37.760> 40%

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:38.660 
this at around 40%

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:41.890 
this at around 40%
how<00:03:39.500> do<00:03:39.799> you<00:03:39.950> explain<00:03:40.220> this<00:03:40.430> well<00:03:41.120> I<00:03:41.150> think<00:03:41.269> one

Montez you know
we've<00:03:43.819> done<00:03:44.000> little<00:03:44.239> things<00:03:44.569> that<00:03:44.659> try<00:03:44.959> to

00:03:45.009 --> 00:03:45.019 
we've done little things that try to

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:47.710 
we've done little things that try to
help<00:03:45.890> increase<00:03:46.189> that<00:03:46.340> range<00:03:46.790> just<00:03:47.180> from<00:03:47.450> body

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:47.720 
help increase that range just from body

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:50.140 
help increase that range just from body
lean<00:03:48.079> to<00:03:48.409> certain<00:03:49.040> things<00:03:49.220> Monta<00:03:49.939> had<00:03:50.120> a

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:50.150 
lean to certain things Monta had a

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:52.809 
lean to certain things Monta had a
tendency<00:03:50.799> first<00:03:51.799> thing<00:03:51.980> I<00:03:52.069> noticed<00:03:52.489> was<00:03:52.640> to

00:03:52.809 --> 00:03:52.819 
tendency first thing I noticed was to

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:55.179 
tendency first thing I noticed was to
really<00:03:53.150> fall<00:03:53.599> back<00:03:53.810> on<00:03:54.049> this<00:03:54.170> shot<00:03:54.439> which<00:03:55.159> was

00:03:55.179 --> 00:03:55.189 
really fall back on this shot which was

00:03:55.189 --> 00:03:57.699 
really fall back on this shot which was
kind<00:03:55.970> of<00:03:56.060> taking<00:03:56.420> away<00:03:56.629> some<00:03:56.840> distance<00:03:57.319> boring

00:03:57.699 --> 00:03:57.709 
kind of taking away some distance boring

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:00.309 
kind of taking away some distance boring
and<00:03:58.220> so<00:03:58.489> from<00:03:58.879> this<00:03:59.000> free<00:03:59.239> throw<00:03:59.540> to<00:03:59.569> eating

00:04:00.309 --> 00:04:00.319 
and so from this free throw to eating

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:01.449 
and so from this free throw to eating
this<00:04:00.409> three-point<00:04:00.890> shot<00:04:01.069> we've<00:04:01.220> tried<00:04:01.430> to

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:01.459 
this three-point shot we've tried to

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:02.800 
this three-point shot we've tried to
count<00:04:01.730> on<00:04:01.849> what<00:04:02.030> I<00:04:02.060> call<00:04:02.299> keeping<00:04:02.689> your

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:02.810 
count on what I call keeping your

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:04.960 
count on what I call keeping your
shoulders<00:04:03.200> in<00:04:03.349> the<00:04:03.439> shot<00:04:03.650> kind<00:04:04.459> of<00:04:04.640> mentality

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:04.970 
shoulders in the shot kind of mentality

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:07.750 
shoulders in the shot kind of mentality
and<00:04:05.420> I<00:04:06.049> think<00:04:06.260> it's<00:04:06.409> really<00:04:06.590> starting<00:04:07.400> to<00:04:07.579> see

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:07.760 
and I think it's really starting to see

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:09.929 
and I think it's really starting to see
his<00:04:07.970> range<00:04:08.239> really<00:04:08.900> start<00:04:09.319> to<00:04:09.470> start<00:04:09.739> to

00:04:09.929 --> 00:04:09.939 
his range really start to start to

00:04:09.939 --> 00:04:13.360 
his range really start to start to
improve<00:04:10.939> that<00:04:11.450> way<00:04:11.629> and<00:04:11.930> it<00:04:12.260> you<00:04:12.920> know<00:04:13.040> you<00:04:13.099> got

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:13.370 
improve that way and it you know you got

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:14.920 
improve that way and it you know you got
to<00:04:13.489> get<00:04:13.579> Monta<00:04:13.970> the<00:04:14.120> credit<00:04:14.450> for<00:04:14.599> putting<00:04:14.840> the
