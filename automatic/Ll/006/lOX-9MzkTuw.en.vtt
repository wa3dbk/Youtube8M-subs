00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:12.830 

the<00:00:10.710> clarity<00:00:11.370> has<00:00:11.910> always<00:00:12.150> been<00:00:12.450> the<00:00:12.660> thing

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
the clarity has always been the thing

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.709 
the clarity has always been the thing
that<00:00:13.049> I've<00:00:13.170> chased<00:00:13.500> after<00:00:14.089> the<00:00:15.089> ability<00:00:15.690> to

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
that I've chased after the ability to

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.359 
that I've chased after the ability to
have<00:00:16.230> a<00:00:16.590> group<00:00:17.310> of<00:00:17.550> notes<00:00:17.910> all<00:00:19.189> standing<00:00:20.189> out

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
have a group of notes all standing out

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.420 
have a group of notes all standing out
like<00:00:20.400> in<00:00:20.850> a<00:00:20.970> choir<00:00:21.359> where<00:00:21.810> each<00:00:22.080> note<00:00:23.010> has

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
like in a choir where each note has

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.250 
like in a choir where each note has
specific<00:00:24.260> voice<00:00:25.260> you<00:00:25.830> know<00:00:26.010> that's<00:00:26.310> very

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:27.260 
specific voice you know that's very

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:46.180 
specific voice you know that's very
intentional

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:46.190 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:49.219 

in<00:00:47.190> petal<00:00:47.640> still<00:00:47.909> you've<00:00:48.149> got<00:00:48.390> these<00:00:48.690> courts

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:49.229 
in petal still you've got these courts

00:00:49.229 --> 00:00:52.520 
in petal still you've got these courts
where<00:00:49.620> you've<00:00:50.129> got<00:00:50.339> one<00:00:50.789> note<00:00:51.059> moving<00:00:51.629> up<00:00:52.289> a

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
where you've got one note moving up a

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.649 
where you've got one note moving up a
whole-step<00:00:52.739> one<00:00:53.309> note<00:00:53.579> moving<00:00:54.000> down<00:00:54.299> a<00:00:54.329> whole

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:54.659 
whole-step one note moving down a whole

00:00:54.659 --> 00:00:56.810 
whole-step one note moving down a whole
step<00:00:54.809> and<00:00:55.109> a<00:00:55.199> third<00:00:55.500> note<00:00:55.739> remaining<00:00:56.670> the<00:00:56.789> same

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
step and a third note remaining the same

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.770 
step and a third note remaining the same
all<00:00:57.510> happening<00:00:58.079> at<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.320> same<00:00:58.619> moment<00:00:59.089> and<00:01:00.089> the

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
all happening at the same moment and the

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.880 
all happening at the same moment and the
outcome<00:01:01.350> is<00:01:01.379> this<00:01:01.949> chord<00:01:02.689> that<00:01:03.689> provokes<00:01:04.649> a

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
outcome is this chord that provokes a

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.850 
outcome is this chord that provokes a
lot<00:01:05.100> of<00:01:05.309> different<00:01:05.759> feelings<00:01:06.539> and<00:01:07.110> emotions

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
lot of different feelings and emotions

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.389 
lot of different feelings and emotions
from<00:01:08.100> different<00:01:08.520> people<00:01:09.590> my<00:01:10.590> philosophy<00:01:11.250> is

00:01:11.389 --> 00:01:11.399 
from different people my philosophy is

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:14.300 
from different people my philosophy is
to<00:01:11.610> cross<00:01:12.060> that<00:01:12.619> into<00:01:13.619> what<00:01:13.799> I<00:01:13.830> do<00:01:13.979> with

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
to cross that into what I do with

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.719 
to cross that into what I do with
guitars<00:01:15.110> where<00:01:16.110> you<00:01:16.319> have<00:01:16.530> this<00:01:16.830> tonal<00:01:17.460> thing

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
guitars where you have this tonal thing

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.949 
guitars where you have this tonal thing
happening<00:01:18.530> you<00:01:19.530> have<00:01:19.799> an<00:01:20.610> ergonomic<00:01:21.119> thing

00:01:21.949 --> 00:01:21.959 
happening you have an ergonomic thing

00:01:21.959 --> 00:01:26.090 
happening you have an ergonomic thing
happening<00:01:22.789> you've<00:01:23.789> got<00:01:24.119> an<00:01:24.770> aesthetic<00:01:25.770> thing

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
happening you've got an aesthetic thing

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.080 
happening you've got an aesthetic thing
happening<00:01:26.909> and<00:01:28.399> trying<00:01:29.399> to<00:01:29.520> make<00:01:29.729> all<00:01:30.060> of

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
happening and trying to make all of

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.219 
happening and trying to make all of
those<00:01:30.330> harmonize<00:01:30.990> with<00:01:31.319> each<00:01:31.530> other<00:01:32.720> in<00:01:33.720> the

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
those harmonize with each other in the

00:01:34.229 --> 00:02:04.050 
those harmonize with each other in the
same<00:01:34.470> way<00:01:34.890> a<00:01:35.720> chord<00:01:36.720> does

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.060 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.620 

I<00:02:04.710> guess<00:02:05.710> my<00:02:06.250> style<00:02:06.549> kind<00:02:06.820> of<00:02:06.880> relies<00:02:07.150> on<00:02:07.180> being

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:07.630 
I guess my style kind of relies on being

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:09.449 
I guess my style kind of relies on being
able<00:02:07.720> to<00:02:07.840> hear<00:02:08.020> the<00:02:08.170> picked<00:02:08.380> note<00:02:08.679> and<00:02:08.920> the

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:09.459 
able to hear the picked note and the

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:12.530 
able to hear the picked note and the
percussiveness<00:02:10.000> of<00:02:10.240> the<00:02:10.330> picked<00:02:10.539> note<00:02:10.720> and

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
percussiveness of the picked note and

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.940 
percussiveness of the picked note and
all<00:02:13.540> the<00:02:13.660> guitars<00:02:13.959> that<00:02:14.050> Scots<00:02:14.380> delivered<00:02:14.830> to

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
all the guitars that Scots delivered to

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.270 
all the guitars that Scots delivered to
me<00:02:15.720> excel<00:02:16.720> at<00:02:16.900> that<00:02:17.050> quality<00:02:17.260> the<00:02:17.980> thing<00:02:18.160> would

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
me excel at that quality the thing would

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:19.770 
me excel at that quality the thing would
be<00:02:18.400> every<00:02:18.610> guitar<00:02:18.910> players<00:02:19.120> dream<00:02:19.390> to<00:02:19.600> have<00:02:19.720> a

Belov<00:03:19.450> collaborating<00:03:20.140> the<00:03:20.230> sky<00:03:20.440> I<00:03:20.860> thought

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:21.640 
Belov collaborating the sky I thought

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:24.720 
Belov collaborating the sky I thought
it'd<00:03:21.790> be<00:03:21.850> neat<00:03:22.150> when<00:03:22.660> it<00:03:22.840> came<00:03:23.459> when<00:03:24.459> it<00:03:24.549> came

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:24.730 
it'd be neat when it came when it came

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:26.699 
it'd be neat when it came when it came
up<00:03:24.940> that<00:03:25.060> I<00:03:25.120> could<00:03:25.299> be<00:03:25.390> getting<00:03:25.570> into<00:03:26.500> one<00:03:26.620> of

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:26.709 
up that I could be getting into one of

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:28.199 
up that I could be getting into one of
these<00:03:26.860> but<00:03:27.190> it's<00:03:27.280> got<00:03:27.489> that<00:03:27.519> you<00:03:27.850> know<00:03:27.970> maybe
