was I believe we have decided not to run
with<00:00:49.510> the<00:00:50.129> product<00:00:51.129> and<00:00:51.550> they've<00:00:52.420> gone<00:00:52.570> with

00:00:52.799 --> 00:00:52.809 
with the product and they've gone with

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:58.560 
with the product and they've gone with
the<00:00:52.929> original<00:00:53.320> Alex<00:00:53.829> Moss<00:00:55.019> and<00:00:56.039> gimbal<00:00:57.570> and

00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:58.570 
the original Alex Moss and gimbal and

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:01.349 
the original Alex Moss and gimbal and
grip<00:00:59.260> water<00:00:59.469> so<00:01:00.159> you<00:01:00.280> can<00:01:00.519> use<00:01:01.030> the<00:01:01.239> original

00:01:01.349 --> 00:01:01.359 
grip water so you can use the original

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:04.020 
grip water so you can use the original
software<00:01:02.140> so<00:01:02.589> here<00:01:02.920> we<00:01:03.100> go<00:01:03.249> let's<00:01:03.519> see<00:01:03.819> what<00:01:03.850> we

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:04.030 
software so here we go let's see what we

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:10.130 
software so here we go let's see what we
have<00:01:04.059> inside<00:01:04.390> yeah<00:01:05.460> you<00:01:06.460> have<00:01:06.670> some<00:01:06.909> cables<00:01:08.159> ok

yep ok yep then see it some bubble up we
have<00:01:25.140> now<00:01:26.140> I<00:01:26.200> can<00:01:26.410> see<00:01:26.760> I'm<00:01:27.760> get<00:01:28.000> this<00:01:28.090> copÃ¡n

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:48.960 

no<00:01:35.730> sensor<00:01:39.270> to<00:01:40.270> unsafe<00:01:43.230> have<00:01:46.830> the<00:01:47.830> c-axis

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:48.970 
no sensor to unsafe have the c-axis

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:56.219 
no sensor to unsafe have the c-axis
controller<00:01:53.490> as<00:01:54.490> you<00:01:54.700> can<00:01:54.820> see<00:01:55.030> looks<00:01:55.990> very

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:56.229 
controller as you can see looks very

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:10.229 
controller as you can see looks very
nice<00:01:58.740> see<00:01:59.740> that<00:01:59.920> there<00:02:08.489> that<00:02:09.489> to<00:02:10.030> access

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:10.239 
nice see that there that to access

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:15.360 
nice see that there that to access
controller<00:02:11.850> with<00:02:14.250> Alex

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
controller with Alex

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:22.740 
controller with Alex
Moss<00:02:15.730> in<00:02:16.090> bootloader<00:02:17.520> original<00:02:18.540> and<00:02:21.750> will

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
Moss in bootloader original and will

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:27.030 
Moss in bootloader original and will
obviously<00:02:23.020> do<00:02:23.380> a<00:02:25.290> connection<00:02:26.290> video<00:02:26.590> of<00:02:26.830> how

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
obviously do a connection video of how

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.240 
obviously do a connection video of how
you<00:02:27.100> set<00:02:27.370> this<00:02:27.520> up<00:02:27.580> I'm<00:02:28.000> will<00:02:28.300> test<00:02:28.600> it<00:02:29.010> and<00:02:30.010> we

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
you set this up I'm will test it and we

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.010 
you set this up I'm will test it and we
will<00:02:30.459> report<00:02:30.880> back<00:02:31.090> to<00:02:31.150> you<00:02:31.420> and<00:02:31.630> let<00:02:31.870> you<00:02:31.959> know

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:32.020 
will report back to you and let you know

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:37.530 
will report back to you and let you know
our<00:02:32.709> findings<00:02:33.250> but<00:02:34.180> yes<00:02:35.050> it<00:02:35.260> looks<00:02:36.330> very<00:02:37.330> well

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
our findings but yes it looks very well

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:38.960 
our findings but yes it looks very well
built

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
built

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.930 
built
so<00:02:39.970> we'll<00:02:40.120> do<00:02:40.269> a<00:02:40.299> connection<00:02:40.810> video<00:02:41.940> once

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940 
so we'll do a connection video once

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:45.810 
so we'll do a connection video once
we've<00:02:43.209> had<00:02:43.900> a<00:02:43.959> good<00:02:44.170> look<00:02:44.260> at<00:02:44.470> and<00:02:45.370> we'll<00:02:45.640> let

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:45.820 
we've had a good look at and we'll let

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:49.680 
we've had a good look at and we'll let
you<00:02:45.910> know<00:02:45.940> what<00:02:46.330> we<00:02:46.450> think<00:02:46.480> can't<00:02:48.209> say<00:02:49.209> connect

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690 
you know what we think can't say connect

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:54.770 
you know what we think can't say connect
it<00:02:49.810> up<00:02:52.110> it's<00:02:53.110> very<00:02:53.320> good<00:02:53.530> there

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
it up it's very good there

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.289 
it up it's very good there
normal<00:02:55.780> connections<00:02:56.310> right<00:02:57.310> guys<00:02:57.549> that's<00:02:58.030> it

00:02:58.289 --> 00:02:58.299 
normal connections right guys that's it

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:00.390 
normal connections right guys that's it
basically<00:02:58.690> unboxing<00:02:59.470> there<00:02:59.590> we<00:02:59.769> believe<00:03:00.280> this

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
basically unboxing there we believe this

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.320 
basically unboxing there we believe this
cables<00:03:00.880> here<00:03:01.180> I'll<00:03:01.540> be<00:03:02.019> for<00:03:02.260> the<00:03:02.380> sensor<00:03:03.330> and

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:04.330 
cables here I'll be for the sensor and

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:09.030 
cables here I'll be for the sensor and
their<00:03:06.360> table<00:03:07.360> for<00:03:07.510> them<00:03:07.650> yeah<00:03:08.650> I<00:03:08.680> believe<00:03:08.769> this

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
their table for them yeah I believe this

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:10.289 
their table for them yeah I believe this
will<00:03:09.220> be<00:03:09.340> for<00:03:09.519> the<00:03:09.549> sensor<00:03:10.000> and<00:03:10.120> the<00:03:10.209> other

00:03:10.289 --> 00:03:10.299 
will be for the sensor and the other

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:12.000 
will be for the sensor and the other
ones<00:03:10.480> will<00:03:10.630> be<00:03:10.780> for<00:03:11.019> the<00:03:11.110> extension

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
ones will be for the extension

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:16.130 
ones will be for the extension
these<00:03:12.580> are<00:03:12.760> before<00:03:13.209> this<00:03:13.570> board<00:03:14.500> here

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
these are before this board here

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:19.050 
these are before this board here
extension<00:03:17.140> board<00:03:17.410> well<00:03:18.310> we'll<00:03:18.549> say<00:03:18.700> it<00:03:18.820> up<00:03:18.910> and

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
extension board well we'll say it up and

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:19.890 
extension board well we'll say it up and
we'll<00:03:19.150> get<00:03:19.269> we'll<00:03:19.420> get<00:03:19.540> back<00:03:19.660> to<00:03:19.810> you

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 
we'll get we'll get back to you

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.360 
we'll get we'll get back to you
somewhere<00:03:20.140> you<00:03:20.200> know<00:03:20.410> what's<00:03:20.620> what's<00:03:21.010> what
