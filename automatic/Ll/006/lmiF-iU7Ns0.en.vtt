00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:06.299
 I thought I'm doing a hair today 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.309
 tutorial because many of my viewers 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.650
 have mine under mine like i have 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.840
 long hair get video written 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.880
 that they are very desperate because they are 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.279
 want to grow your hair long 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.720
 and it really takes a very long time and 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.539
 also until you get the transition 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.550
 and I remembered that 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.220
 then a video about my beautiful 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.410
 Everyday hairstyles and have done 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.500
 he was just a hairstyle that was 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.420
 really a great tip for people who 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.710
 the hair just want to have longer 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:39.300
 but not necessarily now 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:42.059
 want to wear extensions or else or 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.010
 Other and I thought so myself 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.750
 I'll have an extra video on this 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.520
 make hairstyle because I find them 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.170
 really helpful than me 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.300
 Hair had not been so long 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.579
 This hairstyle is really nice too 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.920
 worn and it is very easy for her 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.410
 just needs a hairbrush and a 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.930
 Scrunchies are best without this 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.149
 silver wire partly healthier for the 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.280
 Hair and I will show you now 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.260
 How this hairstyle works first 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.630
 can you get your hair through the im 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.990
 afterwards no nasty knots arise 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.990
 can 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:24.950
 and after that, you're splitting your hair off that 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:27.520
 means you take a top hair 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:27.520
 game 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:33.200
 take a few laterally 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:36.470
 strands of rheine with that mayer of 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:38.780
 the page looks very real and afterwards 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:41.270
 Do you have something of the long hair 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:44.240
 left here because you only have the 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:49.030
 upper hair take and you fight 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:49.030
 then together to a braid 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:08.479
 if your upper hair is about the same 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.700
 are distributed with your lower hair 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:15.190
 then you take one 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:18.850
 hairy and makes you completely normal 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:18.850
 a braid 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:29.640
 so then you have a braid that that 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.590
 whole later still looks more genuine 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.060
 Of course you have a few hair strands 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.400
 take that a bit forward 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.620
 then the whole thing becomes something 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.150
 looser and not so strict anymore 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.130
 but it should still be after that 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:43.080
 That's why you can hold firm 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:46.680
 here again the whole thing together 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:49.770
 Do not pull it so bad now 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:52.020
 here this lower part recognizes that 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:55.410
 you really after a whole braid 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:57.920
 You can of course look down here 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:02.250
 either to make a further hook 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:04.710
 or tell your braid the upper one 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:05.220
 far apart that the hair here so 

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:07.620
 about it 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:10.020
 and when the whole is done then you see 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:11.130
 that after a really very long one 

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:12.810
 braid off 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:15.720
 and that leaves your hair natural 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:17.580
 visually much longer can act 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.260
 of course, the braid on the side 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:21.540
 take it really looks again 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:24.600
 very nice again 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:26.520
 a very nice long braid I am 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:28.620
 I'm sure that one or the other too 

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:30.510
 but I already knew the tip 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:32.490
 Just give the tip for those 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:34.620
 who are just a bit desperate and 

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:36.600
 I really want long hair and I am 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:38.070
 I'm sure that not everyone has this 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:39.780
 know and that's why I wanted 

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:42.420
 be sure to turn this video 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:43.770
 I hope you liked this video 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:46.400
 and then we'll see each other in mine 

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:46.400
 next video
