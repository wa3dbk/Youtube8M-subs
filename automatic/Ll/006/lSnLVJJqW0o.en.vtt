you guys and I've tried this commentary

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.460 
you guys and I've tried this commentary
so<00:00:14.790> many<00:00:14.969> times<00:00:15.240> I<00:00:15.540> normally<00:00:16.139> most<00:00:16.289> of<00:00:16.410> my

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
so many times I normally most of my

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.320 
so many times I normally most of my
commentaries<00:00:17.039> I<00:00:17.250> don't<00:00:17.820> know<00:00:17.910> if<00:00:18.029> I've<00:00:18.150> said

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
commentaries I don't know if I've said

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.029 
commentaries I don't know if I've said
this<00:00:18.480> before<00:00:18.539> but<00:00:18.869> they're<00:00:19.289> mostly<00:00:19.410> one<00:00:19.800> takes

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
this before but they're mostly one takes

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.150 
this before but they're mostly one takes
like<00:00:20.310> I<00:00:20.520> just<00:00:21.029> turned<00:00:21.359> on<00:00:21.449> the<00:00:21.539> camera<00:00:21.689> and<00:00:22.160> bam

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
like I just turned on the camera and bam

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.609 
like I just turned on the camera and bam
and<00:00:23.699> it's<00:00:24.539> what<00:00:24.720> makes<00:00:24.900> my<00:00:25.080> commentaries

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
and it's what makes my commentaries

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.439 
and it's what makes my commentaries
lively<00:00:26.099> and<00:00:26.250> genuine<00:00:26.670> and<00:00:26.820> all<00:00:26.910> that<00:00:27.090> is<00:00:27.269> that

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
me about in advance yes I do have optic

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.160 
me about in advance yes I do have optic
gaming<00:01:07.439> beating<00:01:08.369> complexity<00:01:09.270> when<00:01:09.869> they<00:01:09.960> face

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
gaming beating complexity when they face

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.250 
gaming beating complexity when they face
them<00:01:10.409> in<00:01:10.530> winners<00:01:10.860> round<00:01:11.100> 3<00:01:11.490> yes<00:01:12.260> that's

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
that's not really an issue because

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.340

champs and if you notice if you look at

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:19.940 
champs and if you notice if you look at
my<00:01:18.750> bracket<00:01:19.200> when<00:01:19.320> I<00:01:19.350> pop<00:01:19.560> it<00:01:19.680> up<00:01:19.740> on<00:01:19.860> the

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
my bracket when I pop it up on the

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.280 
my bracket when I pop it up on the
screen<00:01:20.040> when<00:01:20.820> they<00:01:20.939> face<00:01:21.150> each<00:01:21.180> other<00:01:21.509> later

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
screen when they face each other later

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.050 
screen when they face each other later
in<00:01:22.590> like<00:01:22.740> losers<00:01:23.130> around<00:01:23.280> six<00:01:23.759> or<00:01:23.909> something

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
in like losers around six or something

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.390 
in like losers around six or something
like<00:01:24.299> that<00:01:24.360> I<00:01:24.780> do<00:01:25.259> have<00:01:25.530> complexity<00:01:26.070> actually

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
like that I do have complexity actually

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.569 
like that I do have complexity actually
beating<00:01:26.759> optic<00:01:27.150> and<00:01:27.330> going<00:01:28.049> into<00:01:28.380> the<00:01:29.159> finals

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
beating optic and going into the finals

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.289 
beating optic and going into the finals
against<00:01:29.939> TK<00:01:30.270> so<00:01:31.430> but<00:01:32.430> there's<00:01:32.610> a<00:01:32.670> few<00:01:32.850> factors

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
against TK so but there's a few factors

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.060 
against TK so but there's a few factors
that<00:01:33.509> I<00:01:33.570> believe<00:01:33.990> that<00:01:34.020> people<00:01:34.560> are<00:01:34.710> thinking

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
that I believe that people are thinking

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.160 
that I believe that people are thinking
about<00:01:35.400> that<00:01:36.299> I<00:01:36.329> believe<00:01:36.630> is<00:01:36.750> going<00:01:36.810> to<00:01:36.930> factor

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
about that I believe is going to factor

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.520 
about that I believe is going to factor
into<00:01:37.470> some<00:01:38.340> juice<00:01:38.610> some<00:01:39.210> optic<00:01:39.630> juice<00:01:39.869> no<00:01:40.290> pun
