speedy release is how you get him but
still<00:01:43.170> when<00:01:43.350> you<00:01:43.439> try<00:01:43.590> to<00:01:43.649> speed<00:01:43.890> release<00:01:44.159> he's

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
still when you try to speed release he's

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.130 
still when you try to speed release he's
very<00:01:44.579> physical<00:01:44.880> at<00:01:45.720> the<00:01:45.840> line<00:01:45.990> of<00:01:46.110> scrimmage

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140
