also kind of slimming to it just kind of

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:12.620 
also kind of slimming to it just kind of
I<00:04:10.230> guess<00:04:10.560> maybe<00:04:11.070> because<00:04:11.520> it<00:04:11.700> just<00:04:11.850> brings

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:12.630 
I guess maybe because it just brings

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:15.980 
I guess maybe because it just brings
deep<00:04:13.170> like<00:04:13.470> it<00:04:14.100> draws<00:04:14.400> your<00:04:14.430> eyes<00:04:14.850> to<00:04:15.570> the

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:20.790

for<00:04:23.370> my<00:04:23.520> shoes<00:04:23.790> I<00:04:24.000> decided<00:04:24.330> to<00:04:24.450> go<00:04:24.570> with<00:04:24.690> these

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:24.900 
for my shoes I decided to go with these

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:26.480 
for my shoes I decided to go with these
from<00:04:25.140> target<00:04:25.560> I<00:04:25.650> got<00:04:25.830> these<00:04:25.980> a<00:04:26.040> couple<00:04:26.430> of

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:26.490 
from target I got these a couple of

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:29.390 
from target I got these a couple of
years<00:04:26.640> ago<00:04:27.350> so<00:04:28.350> I'm<00:04:28.680> sure<00:04:28.860> they<00:04:28.980> don't<00:04:29.190> have

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:29.400 
years ago so I'm sure they don't have

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:32.210 
years ago so I'm sure they don't have
them<00:04:29.580> anymore<00:04:29.640> but<00:04:30.390> they<00:04:30.930> just<00:04:31.190> look<00:04:32.190> like

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:32.220 
them anymore but they just look like

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:36.680 
them anymore but they just look like
that<00:04:32.730> and<00:04:34.310> I<00:04:35.310> just<00:04:35.700> thought<00:04:35.910> that<00:04:36.060> I<00:04:36.330> would

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:36.690

that and I just thought that I would
pull<00:04:36.990> in<00:04:37.170> together<00:04:37.670> the<00:04:38.670> zipper<00:04:39.570> on<00:04:39.720> the<00:04:39.780> shirt

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:40.140 
pull in together the zipper on the shirt

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:42.290 
pull in together the zipper on the shirt
and<00:04:40.410> the<00:04:40.500> zipper<00:04:40.950> on<00:04:40.980> the<00:04:41.130> shoe<00:04:41.430> and<00:04:41.730> it<00:04:41.970> just
