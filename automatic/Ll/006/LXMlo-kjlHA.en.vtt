00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:05.870 
now here's our standard clawfoot tub

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:08.720 
now here's our standard clawfoot tub
it's<00:00:06.870> got<00:00:07.020> blue<00:00:07.290> paint<00:00:07.620> on<00:00:07.799> the<00:00:07.919> outside<00:00:07.950> we'd

and look at this I'm ding on the side

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:14.299 
and look at this I'm ding on the side
and<00:00:12.690> the<00:00:12.750> bathing<00:00:12.990> well<00:00:13.290> is<00:00:13.469> quite<00:00:13.769> beaten<00:00:14.160> up

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
and the bathing well is quite beaten up

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:15.530 
and the bathing well is quite beaten up
here<00:00:14.549> so<00:00:14.700> how<00:00:14.820> you<00:00:14.880> going<00:00:14.969> to<00:00:15.059> refinish<00:00:15.269> this

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
here so how you going to refinish this

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:16.790 
here so how you going to refinish this
thing<00:00:15.719> I'm<00:00:16.170> going<00:00:16.260> to<00:00:16.320> start<00:00:16.590> with<00:00:16.680> the

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
thing I'm going to start with the

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.529 
thing I'm going to start with the
exterior<00:00:16.890> the<00:00:17.369> tub<00:00:17.580> would<00:00:17.970> apply<00:00:18.180> a<00:00:18.210> paint

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
exterior the tub would apply a paint

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.090 
exterior the tub would apply a paint
stripper<00:00:18.779> to<00:00:19.050> it<00:00:19.199> let<00:00:19.740> it<00:00:19.770> sit<00:00:19.890> for

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
stripper to it let it sit for

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.099 
stripper to it let it sit for
approximately<00:00:20.760> 20<00:00:21.029> minutes<00:00:21.150> we'll<00:00:21.810> scrape

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
approximately 20 minutes we'll scrape

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.370 
approximately 20 minutes we'll scrape
the<00:00:22.260> old<00:00:22.380> finish<00:00:22.619> right<00:00:22.859> off<00:00:24.140> that's<00:00:25.140> coming

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
the old finish right off that's coming

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.290 
the old finish right off that's coming
right<00:00:25.529> off<00:00:25.560> it's<00:00:26.369> coming<00:00:26.640> off<00:00:26.760> a<00:00:26.789> very<00:00:27.060> little

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
right off it's coming off a very little

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.700 
right off it's coming off a very little
effort<00:00:27.420> all<00:00:27.990> right<00:00:28.170> so<00:00:28.289> that's<00:00:28.410> for<00:00:28.650> the

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
effort all right so that's for the

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.710 
effort all right so that's for the
outside<00:00:29.010> what<00:00:29.099> about<00:00:29.279> the<00:00:29.369> inside<00:00:29.760> the<00:00:30.390> inside

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
outside what about the inside the inside

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.359 
outside what about the inside the inside
of<00:00:30.840> the<00:00:30.900> tub<00:00:31.050> we're<00:00:31.260> going<00:00:31.380> to<00:00:31.439> apply<00:00:31.769> an<00:00:31.949> acid

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
of the tub we're going to apply an acid

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.310 
of the tub we're going to apply an acid
etch<00:00:32.489> to<00:00:32.669> the<00:00:32.759> finish<00:00:33.090> acid<00:00:33.630> etch<00:00:33.870> that's

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
etch to the finish acid etch that's

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.930 
etch to the finish acid etch that's
right<00:00:34.590> what<00:00:34.920> that<00:00:35.070> will<00:00:35.190> do<00:00:35.340> is<00:00:35.370> it<00:00:35.790> will

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
right what that will do is it will

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.690 
right what that will do is it will
abrade<00:00:36.690> the<00:00:36.719> inside<00:00:37.710> finish<00:00:38.100> allow<00:00:38.460> for

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
abrade the inside finish allow for

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.369 
abrade the inside finish allow for
better<00:00:38.879> bond<00:00:39.149> between<00:00:39.360> the<00:00:39.719> paint<00:00:39.989> and<00:00:40.170> tub

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
better bond between the paint and tub

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:41.930 
better bond between the paint and tub
sort<00:00:40.800> of<00:00:40.890> scratch<00:00:41.190> it<00:00:41.370> up<00:00:41.489> so<00:00:41.610> the<00:00:41.700> paint<00:00:41.910> will

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
sort of scratch it up so the paint will

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.970 
sort of scratch it up so the paint will
stick<00:00:42.030> exactly<00:00:42.809> fit<00:00:45.590> all<00:00:46.590> right<00:00:46.739> so<00:00:46.860> that's

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
stick exactly fit all right so that's

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.069 
stick exactly fit all right so that's
the<00:00:47.219> acid<00:00:47.399> going<00:00:47.879> in<00:00:48.030> that's<00:00:48.750> right<00:00:48.960> that's

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
the acid going in that's right that's

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.080 
the acid going in that's right that's
hydrofluoric<00:00:49.590> acid<00:00:49.890> he's<00:00:50.340> going<00:00:50.550> to<00:00:50.610> take

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
hydrofluoric acid he's going to take

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.910 
hydrofluoric acid he's going to take
that<00:00:51.270> spreadeth<00:00:51.690> out<00:00:51.870> all<00:00:52.020> over<00:00:52.140> the<00:00:52.440> finish

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
that spreadeth out all over the finish

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.340 
that spreadeth out all over the finish
of<00:00:53.129> the<00:00:53.190> tub<00:00:53.399> let<00:00:54.120> it<00:00:54.210> sit<00:00:54.420> about<00:00:54.539> 15<00:00:55.020> minutes

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
of the tub let it sit about 15 minutes

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.709 
of the tub let it sit about 15 minutes
and<00:00:56.190> we'll<00:00:56.789> be<00:00:56.879> able<00:00:56.940> to<00:00:57.090> wash<00:00:57.210> it<00:00:57.390> off<00:00:57.510> after

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
and we'll be able to wash it off after

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.110 
and we'll be able to wash it off after
well<00:00:58.199> it's<00:00:58.350> quite<00:00:58.530> a<00:00:58.559> strong<00:00:58.980> smell<00:00:59.460> I'm<00:00:59.879> glad

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
well it's quite a strong smell I'm glad

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:07.360 
well it's quite a strong smell I'm glad
he's<00:01:00.300> got<00:01:00.420> some<00:01:00.629> protection<00:01:01.199> for<00:01:01.289> his<00:01:01.410> lungs

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:07.370 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:09.830 

so<00:01:08.370> it's<00:01:08.520> been<00:01:08.640> about<00:01:08.730> 20<00:01:09.270> minutes<00:01:09.600> is<00:01:09.720> that

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
so it's been about 20 minutes is that

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.870 
so it's been about 20 minutes is that
enough<00:01:10.020> time<00:01:10.200> for<00:01:10.410> our<00:01:10.530> acid<00:01:10.920> to<00:01:11.010> work<00:01:11.190> with

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
enough time for our acid to work with

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.910 
enough time for our acid to work with
just<00:01:12.090> about<00:01:12.180> there<00:01:12.600> while<00:01:13.440> we'll<00:01:13.560> wait<00:01:13.710> and

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
just about there while we'll wait and

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.770 
just about there while we'll wait and
we're<00:01:14.010> going<00:01:14.160> to<00:01:14.220> use<00:01:14.550> the<00:01:14.700> time<00:01:14.940> to<00:01:14.970> use<00:01:15.600> some

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
we're going to use the time to use some

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.840 
we're going to use the time to use some
hand<00:01:15.960> tools<00:01:16.260> and<00:01:16.440> some<00:01:16.680> sandpaper<00:01:16.890> those

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
hand tools and some sandpaper those

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.250 
hand tools and some sandpaper those
cloth<00:01:18.120> woods<00:01:18.330> can<00:01:18.450> be<00:01:18.540> a<00:01:18.570> pain<00:01:18.840> to<00:01:19.020> get<00:01:19.110> all

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:19.260 
cloth woods can be a pain to get all

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:20.810 
cloth woods can be a pain to get all
that<00:01:19.380> out<00:01:19.440> of<00:01:19.560> those<00:01:19.710> little<00:01:19.860> grooves<00:01:20.310> it<00:01:20.610> is

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
that out of those little grooves it is

he's using that is just water it
neutralizes<00:01:29.400> the<00:01:29.490> hydrofluoric<00:01:30.120> acid<00:01:30.330> that

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:30.690 
neutralizes the hydrofluoric acid that

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:32.900 
neutralizes the hydrofluoric acid that
we're<00:01:30.840> using<00:01:31.020> and<00:01:31.440> be<00:01:32.220> able<00:01:32.370> to<00:01:32.460> wipe<00:01:32.640> down<00:01:32.670> the
