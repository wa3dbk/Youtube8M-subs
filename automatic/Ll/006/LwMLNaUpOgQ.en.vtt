00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:54.490 
45 this car automatically slows down to

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:56.760 
45 this car automatically slows down to
maintain<00:04:54.910> distance<00:04:55.240> as<00:04:55.600> the<00:04:55.750> car<00:04:55.960> slows<00:04:56.530> up

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:56.770 
maintain distance as the car slows up

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:00.120 
maintain distance as the car slows up
speeds<00:04:57.700> up<00:04:57.880> and<00:04:58.030> slows<00:04:58.090> down<00:04:58.770> that's<00:04:59.770> a<00:04:59.890> really

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:00.130 
speeds up and slows down that's a really

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:01.680 
speeds up and slows down that's a really
nice<00:05:00.310> feature<00:05:00.580> especially<00:05:00.850> here<00:05:01.419> in<00:05:01.570> the

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:01.690 
nice feature especially here in the

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:03.360 
nice feature especially here in the
populated<00:05:02.290> cities

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:03.370 
populated cities

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:05.340 
populated cities
that's<00:05:03.850> the<00:05:04.150> radar<00:05:04.480> cruise<00:05:04.660> control<00:05:04.720> and<00:05:05.260> it

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:05.350 
that's the radar cruise control and it

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:08.520 
that's the radar cruise control and it
has<00:05:05.590> also<00:05:05.919> a<00:05:06.100> pre<00:05:06.640> collision<00:05:06.970> system<00:05:07.330> so<00:05:08.200> if

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:08.530 
has also a pre collision system so if

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:10.070 
has also a pre collision system so if
you're<00:05:08.680> about<00:05:08.890> to<00:05:09.070> crash

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:10.080 
you're about to crash

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:11.899 
you're about to crash
and<00:05:10.470> you<00:05:10.620> don't<00:05:10.830> hit<00:05:10.979> the<00:05:11.069> brakes<00:05:11.340> the<00:05:11.669> car

00:05:11.899 --> 00:05:11.909 
and you don't hit the brakes the car

00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:13.749 
and you don't hit the brakes the car
will<00:05:12.300> usually<00:05:12.930> hit<00:05:13.169> the<00:05:13.289> brakes

00:05:13.749 --> 00:05:13.759 
will usually hit the brakes

00:05:13.759 --> 00:05:16.730 
will usually hit the brakes
automatically<00:05:14.810> so<00:05:15.810> that<00:05:15.990> you<00:05:16.080> crash<00:05:16.409> at<00:05:16.650> a

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:16.740 
automatically so that you crash at a

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:18.170 
automatically so that you crash at a
much<00:05:16.919> lower<00:05:17.129> speed<00:05:17.400> and<00:05:17.580> do<00:05:17.879> a<00:05:17.909> lot<00:05:18.150> less

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:18.180 
much lower speed and do a lot less

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:23.210 
much lower speed and do a lot less
damage<00:05:19.250> and<00:05:20.250> in<00:05:20.490> some<00:05:20.759> cases<00:05:21.229> you<00:05:22.229> may<00:05:22.440> even<00:05:22.800> be

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:23.220 
damage and in some cases you may even be
