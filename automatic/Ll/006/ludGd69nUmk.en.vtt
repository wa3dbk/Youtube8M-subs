an<00:05:36.480> opinion<00:05:36.990> sure<00:05:37.950> but<00:05:38.220> i<00:05:38.250> think<00:05:38.310> it<00:05:38.639> might<00:05:38.790> be

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:38.820 
an opinion sure but i think it might be

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:41.420 
an opinion sure but i think it might be
on<00:05:39.270> arguable<00:05:40.080> i<00:05:40.230> would<00:05:40.680> take<00:05:40.860> them<00:05:41.070> against

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:41.430 
on arguable i would take them against

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:42.830 
on arguable i would take them against
anybody<00:05:41.820> that's<00:05:42.030> ever<00:05:42.150> coming<00:05:42.660> here

00:05:51.379 --> 00:05:51.389 
your belt what's not good you know i

00:05:51.389 --> 00:05:53.300 
your belt what's not good you know i
can't<00:05:51.840> stand<00:05:52.320> that<00:05:52.530> part<00:05:52.830> of<00:05:52.950> it<00:05:53.040> i<00:05:53.100> would

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:53.310 
can't stand that part of it i would

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:55.100 
can't stand that part of it i would
rather<00:05:53.460> play<00:05:53.940> to<00:05:54.000> do<00:05:54.210> i<00:05:54.540> think<00:05:54.780> it<00:05:54.870> would<00:05:54.990> have

been<00:05:55.200> better<00:05:55.260> for<00:05:55.560> us<00:05:55.830> but<00:05:56.130> there<00:05:56.880> are<00:05:57.030> some

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:57.270 
been better for us but there are some

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:59.150 
been better for us but there are some
other<00:05:57.480> things<00:05:57.540> that<00:05:57.870> we<00:05:58.200> already<00:05:58.740> talked

00:05:59.150 --> 00:05:59.160 
other things that we already talked

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:02.990 
other things that we already talked
about<00:05:59.310> that<00:05:59.490> and<00:05:59.880> be<00:06:00.210> very<00:06:00.390> positive<00:06:01.050> so<00:06:02.000> we're

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:03.000 
about that and be very positive so we're

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.430 
about that and be very positive so we're
going<00:06:03.090> to<00:06:03.240> say<00:06:03.390> that<00:06:03.600> the<00:06:03.690> positive<00:06:04.230> things

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:04.440 
going to say that the positive things

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:06.380 
going to say that the positive things
outweigh<00:06:04.830> the<00:06:05.010> negative<00:06:05.430> so<00:06:06.210> you're<00:06:06.360> saying

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:06.390 
outweigh the negative so you're saying

00:06:55.689 --> 00:06:55.699 
real close to them that they could

00:06:55.699 --> 00:06:57.939

I<00:06:58.160> mean<00:06:58.520> and<00:06:58.699> Out<00:06:59.150> West<00:06:59.180> out<00:06:59.780> here<00:06:59.810> you<00:07:00.229> know

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:00.260 
I mean and Out West out here you know

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:02.439 
I mean and Out West out here you know
that<00:07:00.590> our<00:07:01.070> closest<00:07:01.490> deals<00:07:01.729> Oregon<00:07:02.150> that's<00:07:02.360> a

00:07:02.439 --> 00:07:02.449 
that our closest deals Oregon that's a

00:07:02.449 --> 00:07:03.790 
that our closest deals Oregon that's a
conference<00:07:02.900> game<00:07:03.080> then<00:07:03.260> who's<00:07:03.440> the<00:07:03.590> next

00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:03.800 
conference game then who's the next

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:05.890 
conference game then who's the next
closest<00:07:04.340> possibility<00:07:05.120> it's<00:07:05.270> not<00:07:05.419> real<00:07:05.630> close

00:07:05.890 --> 00:07:05.900 
closest possibility it's not real close

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:10.689 
closest possibility it's not real close
so<00:07:06.830> you<00:07:07.280> know<00:07:07.400> we<00:07:07.940> and<00:07:08.210> and<00:07:09.220> so<00:07:10.220> that<00:07:10.430> there's

00:07:10.689 --> 00:07:10.699 
so you know we and and so that there's

00:07:10.699 --> 00:07:12.969 
so you know we and and so that there's
not<00:07:10.880> necessarily<00:07:11.449> a<00:07:11.840> lot<00:07:12.110> of<00:07:12.260> draw<00:07:12.530> for

00:07:12.969 --> 00:07:12.979 
not necessarily a lot of draw for

00:07:12.979 --> 00:07:14.890 
not necessarily a lot of draw for
somebody<00:07:13.340> to<00:07:13.400> want<00:07:13.760> to<00:07:13.880> always<00:07:14.060> come<00:07:14.479> out<00:07:14.510> here

00:07:14.890 --> 00:07:14.900 
somebody to want to always come out here

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:16.950 
somebody to want to always come out here
and<00:07:15.050> play<00:07:15.199> and<00:07:15.710> they<00:07:15.919> don't<00:07:16.039> recruit<00:07:16.370> out<00:07:16.639> here

00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:16.960 
and play and they don't recruit out here

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:21.210 
and play and they don't recruit out here
so<00:07:17.960> that's<00:07:18.770> that's<00:07:19.039> a<00:07:19.250> fact

00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:21.220 
so that's that's a fact

00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:23.850 
so that's that's a fact
they<00:07:21.580> obviously<00:07:21.730> it<00:07:22.150> was<00:07:22.240> a<00:07:22.270> kind<00:07:22.570> of<00:07:22.740> just<00:07:23.740> a

00:07:23.850 --> 00:07:23.860 
they obviously it was a kind of just a

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:25.500 
they obviously it was a kind of just a
mental<00:07:24.310> thing<00:07:24.490> for<00:07:24.700> them<00:07:24.910> to<00:07:25.030> come<00:07:25.150> down<00:07:25.390> from

00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:25.510 
mental thing for them to come down from

00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:27.180 
mental thing for them to come down from
the<00:07:25.630> emotions<00:07:26.020> that<00:07:26.080> come<00:07:26.320> we<00:07:26.800> came<00:07:26.950> with<00:07:27.070> the

00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:27.190 
the emotions that come we came with the

00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:28.440 
the emotions that come we came with the
initial<00:07:27.490> decision<00:07:27.850> well<00:07:28.120> you<00:07:28.210> know<00:07:28.300> we're

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:28.450 
initial decision well you know we're

00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:30.660

before a game and then boom it's gone so

00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:36.480 
before a game and then boom it's gone so
the<00:07:35.110> coaches<00:07:35.500> aren't<00:07:35.680> really<00:07:35.980> ready<00:07:36.220> for

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:36.490

00:07:40.590 --> 00:07:40.600 
also you know they're going to go

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:42.450 
also you know they're going to go
through<00:07:40.870> something<00:07:41.350> like<00:07:41.560> a<00:07:41.770> little<00:07:42.130> bit<00:07:42.250> of<00:07:42.370> a

00:07:42.450 --> 00:07:42.460 
through something like a little bit of a

00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:44.430 
through something like a little bit of a
blah<00:07:42.760> about<00:07:43.150> this<00:07:43.450> and<00:07:43.690> then<00:07:44.020> I<00:07:44.110> don't<00:07:44.320> want

00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:44.440 
blah about this and then I don't want

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:46.770 
blah about this and then I don't want
them<00:07:44.530> to<00:07:44.620> get<00:07:44.710> stale<00:07:45.100> you<00:07:45.700> know<00:07:45.820> you<00:07:46.510> know<00:07:46.630> to

00:07:46.770 --> 00:07:46.780 
them to get stale you know you know to

00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:49.080 
them to get stale you know you know to
have<00:07:46.930> a<00:07:46.990> day<00:07:47.260> off<00:07:47.290> and<00:07:47.500> lift<00:07:47.980> weights<00:07:48.070> and<00:07:48.640> use

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:49.090 
have a day off and lift weights and use

00:07:49.090 --> 00:07:50.970 
have a day off and lift weights and use
it<00:07:49.300> that<00:07:49.480> way<00:07:49.630> I<00:07:49.660> think<00:07:49.780> it's<00:07:50.170> very<00:07:50.440> beneficial

00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:50.980 
it that way I think it's very beneficial

00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:52.290 
it that way I think it's very beneficial
time

00:07:52.290 --> 00:07:52.300 
time

00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:54.119 
time
did<00:07:52.750> you<00:07:52.870> sense<00:07:53.050> a<00:07:53.139> lot<00:07:53.229> of<00:07:53.289> frustration<00:07:53.830> and

00:07:54.119 --> 00:07:54.129 
did you sense a lot of frustration and

00:07:54.129 --> 00:07:55.140 
did you sense a lot of frustration and
they<00:07:54.280> don't<00:07:54.370> leave<00:07:54.610> with<00:07:54.729> the<00:07:54.819> player<00:07:55.000> I

00:07:55.140 --> 00:07:55.150 
they don't leave with the player I

00:07:55.150 --> 00:07:57.059 
they don't leave with the player I
didn't<00:07:55.539> really<00:07:55.780> ever<00:07:55.930> you<00:07:56.500> know<00:07:56.620> and<00:07:56.800> maybe<00:07:56.949> we

00:07:57.059 --> 00:07:57.069 
didn't really ever you know and maybe we

00:07:57.069 --> 00:08:00.869 
didn't really ever you know and maybe we
assume<00:07:57.550> more<00:07:57.789> than<00:07:58.289> kids<00:07:59.289> do<00:07:59.530> I<00:07:59.800> think<00:08:00.400> they

00:08:00.869 --> 00:08:00.879 
assume more than kids do I think they

00:08:00.879 --> 00:08:03.210 
assume more than kids do I think they
could<00:08:01.090> be<00:08:01.120> probably<00:08:01.720> fairly<00:08:02.139> resilient<00:08:02.770> about

00:08:03.210 --> 00:08:03.220 
could be probably fairly resilient about

00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:05.760 
could be probably fairly resilient about
this<00:08:03.460> i<00:08:03.669> think<00:08:03.729> it's<00:08:04.349> I'm<00:08:05.349> sure<00:08:05.590> they're

00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:05.770 
this i think it's I'm sure they're

00:08:05.770 --> 00:08:07.950 
this i think it's I'm sure they're
disappointed<00:08:06.220> but<00:08:06.490> I<00:08:06.550> did<00:08:06.789> not<00:08:07.000> see<00:08:07.330> any<00:08:07.569> you

00:08:07.950 --> 00:08:07.960 
disappointed but I did not see any you

00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:10.110 
disappointed but I did not see any you
know<00:08:08.470> gnashing<00:08:09.190> of<00:08:09.280> teeth<00:08:09.340> or<00:08:09.759> anything<00:08:10.090> like

00:08:10.110 --> 00:08:10.120 
know gnashing of teeth or anything like

00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:12.330 
know gnashing of teeth or anything like
that
