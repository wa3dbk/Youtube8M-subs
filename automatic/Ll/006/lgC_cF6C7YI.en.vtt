00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:06.660
 on the last day of the May holiday 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.400
 full container along the training field 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.690
 PSV prepares for the latter 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.860
 competition season of this season 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.860
 against excelsior 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:16.109
 perhaps the most charged yes that 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.850
 it must be clear 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.770
 we have to get in here before the game 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.410
 winning it is actually changing there 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:25.680
 nothing for you no the situation 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.119
 according to bla safe the same as we who 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.680
 convert the game to a profit yes then no 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.410
 I also look no further so that is 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.450
 that's just the wisest for us 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.880
 how do you prepare the team for just like 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.370
 always yes just as we have the past 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:41.250
 I think it's busy too 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.890
 important is a fit in line with the 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.270
 and the team that we don't work with 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.680
 no other doing the other things 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.719
 because a match has quite 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.649
 important is the usual preparation 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.149
 on one 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.920
 on the next game that we have to 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.829
 the team is leading the way 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.890
 physically then physically together 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.180
 good for we barely saw any injuries 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.340
 also from the week that everyone is on the field 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:06.590
 stood outside pieters 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:09.180
 almost fit and mentally fit 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:11.340
 still played in those heads 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.170
 what is being discussed now 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.409
 about what could possibly be a Frisian country 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.869
 happen after it so i notice actually 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:21.030
 not yet no no it's it's league 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.960
 a lot in the news is not yes 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.430
 it is not the 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.080
 do not exclude players from becoming the 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.259
 somewhat concerned about but my name is 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.400
 I will go with players too 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.900
 description of it said about it 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.430
 most important thing is just the we who 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.540
 must win a competition 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.829
 well must not escape there 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.290
 not let ourselves and concentrate 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:38.400
 distracted by the other things we 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.869
 basically no influence at all on a 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.119
 finished 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.560
 excelsior must also make it that way 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.360
 maybe simple is that one 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.070
 benefit 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.710
 yes by how happy I am Depends on 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.240
 how and the competition starts or different 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.619
 start playing than normal or 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.140
 or not or that they might end up 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:57.659
 take the risk it is possible 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.130
 still change during a match 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:01.770
 door does have other 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.420
 intermediate positions but I think we 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.009
 just in our own way 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.140
 who knows how it is just like us 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:08.940
 why physical play is his 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.819
 trance is too radios and phones what 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.950
 cooking is currently not an issue 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:15.870
 on that was after 90 minutes with patience 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.489
 play as the players also be patient 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.290
 had with the fans 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:21.860
 so that everyone has a signature or one 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.860
