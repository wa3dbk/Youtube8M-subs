00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
little crescents not too much so I just

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.390 
little crescents not too much so I just
cut<00:01:29.520> two<00:01:29.790> thin<00:01:30.090> slices<00:01:30.630> and<00:01:30.900> then<00:01:31.619> I<00:01:31.979> break

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
cut two thin slices and then I break

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.170 
cut two thin slices and then I break
them<00:01:32.579> up<00:01:32.729> so<00:01:33.630> there<00:01:33.780> are<00:01:33.840> like<00:01:33.960> little<00:01:34.259> moons

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
then you're just gonna put those in the

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:37.760 
then you're just gonna put those in the
bowl

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
bowl

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.980 
bowl
and<00:01:38.729> you<00:01:38.820> want<00:01:39.000> the<00:01:39.119> onion<00:01:39.420> to<00:01:39.540> be<00:01:39.659> big<00:01:39.869> enough

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
and you want the onion to be big enough

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.539 
and you want the onion to be big enough

them<00:01:48.840> enough<00:01:49.079> raw<00:01:49.350> but<00:01:49.890> then<00:01:50.040> really<00:01:50.340> you<00:01:50.549> get

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
them enough raw but then really you get

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.870 
them enough raw but then really you get
a<00:01:50.729> sweet<00:01:51.210> onion<00:01:51.570> like<00:01:52.049> a<00:01:52.079> Maui<00:01:52.470> onion<00:01:53.009> it's

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
a sweet onion like a Maui onion it's

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.149 
a sweet onion like a Maui onion it's
just<00:01:54.149> okay<00:01:54.960> it's<00:01:55.110> not<00:01:55.259> as<00:01:55.470> sweet<00:01:55.590> as<00:01:55.799> an<00:01:55.860> apple

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
just okay it's not as sweet as an apple

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:57.800

I have at least one fat burning food in
every<00:02:48.209> meal<00:02:48.450> and<00:02:48.750> then<00:02:49.380> this<00:02:49.530> is<00:02:49.739> olive<00:02:50.160> oil<00:02:50.310> as

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
every meal and then this is olive oil as

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:53.390 
every meal and then this is olive oil as
olive<00:02:51.330> oil<00:02:51.480> is<00:02:51.720> maybe<00:02:52.380> it's<00:02:52.620> good<00:02:52.830> for<00:02:53.069> you<00:02:53.190> as

olive oil is maybe it's good for you as
well<00:02:53.660> and<00:02:54.660> then<00:02:55.290> it's<00:02:55.500> salt<00:02:55.769> and<00:02:56.010> white<00:02:56.099> pepper

00:02:56.559 --> 00:02:56.569 
well and then it's salt and white pepper

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:59.930 
well and then it's salt and white pepper
so<00:02:57.569> just<00:02:57.750> a<00:02:57.900> little<00:02:58.200> bit<00:02:58.319> of<00:02:58.410> salt<00:02:58.760> because<00:02:59.760> the

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
so just a little bit of salt because the

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.300 
so just a little bit of salt because the
salt<00:02:59.970> pulls<00:03:00.750> out<00:03:01.110> the<00:03:01.410> flavors<00:03:01.859> that's<00:03:02.070> the

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
salt pulls out the flavors that's the

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:04.130 
salt pulls out the flavors that's the
point<00:03:02.519> of<00:03:02.700> salt<00:03:02.940> it's<00:03:03.150> not<00:03:03.299> so<00:03:03.750> that<00:03:03.840> you<00:03:03.930> eat

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
point of salt it's not so that you eat

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.380 
point of salt it's not so that you eat
food<00:03:04.380> tastes<00:03:04.680> like<00:03:04.829> salt<00:03:05.100> so<00:03:05.760> that<00:03:05.940> you<00:03:06.090> are

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
food tastes like salt so that you are

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:08.660 
food tastes like salt so that you are
able<00:03:06.630> to<00:03:06.870> amplify<00:03:07.109> the<00:03:07.500> flavors<00:03:07.920> and<00:03:08.190> then

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
able to amplify the flavors and then

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:10.370 
able to amplify the flavors and then
white<00:03:08.940> pepper<00:03:09.239> because<00:03:09.540> white<00:03:09.840> pepper<00:03:10.079> has

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
white pepper because white pepper has

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:13.340 
white pepper because white pepper has
the<00:03:10.560> same<00:03:10.799> flavor<00:03:11.459> of<00:03:11.910> black<00:03:12.750> pepper<00:03:13.049> but

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350 
the same flavor of black pepper but

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:16.130 
the same flavor of black pepper but
without<00:03:13.680> that<00:03:13.920> bite<00:03:14.910> you<00:03:15.359> know<00:03:15.480> that<00:03:15.720> attack

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
without that bite you know that attack

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.890 
without that bite you know that attack
on<00:03:16.410> the<00:03:16.530> tongue<00:03:16.799> and<00:03:17.100> it's<00:03:18.060> it's<00:03:18.450> ground

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
on the tongue and it's it's ground

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:20.900 
on the tongue and it's it's ground
really<00:03:19.319> fine<00:03:19.680> so<00:03:19.950> it's<00:03:20.069> almost<00:03:20.250> like<00:03:20.459> a<00:03:20.579> powder

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
really fine so it's almost like a powder

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:23.150 
really fine so it's almost like a powder
and<00:03:21.750> it<00:03:21.870> just<00:03:22.079> it<00:03:22.200> has<00:03:22.380> such<00:03:22.560> a<00:03:22.590> beautiful

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
and it just it has such a beautiful

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.490 
and it just it has such a beautiful
complex<00:03:23.940> flavor<00:03:24.239> people<00:03:24.660> don't<00:03:24.870> often<00:03:25.170> know

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
complex flavor people don't often know

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:26.780 
complex flavor people don't often know
what<00:03:25.709> it<00:03:25.799> is<00:03:25.950> I<00:03:26.160> just<00:03:26.220> think<00:03:26.340> what<00:03:26.579> is<00:03:26.670> that

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
what it is I just think what is that

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:29.990 
what it is I just think what is that
spicy<00:03:27.420> goodness<00:03:27.780> and<00:03:28.260> it's<00:03:28.889> whatever<00:03:29.160> so

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
spicy goodness and it's whatever so

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.729 
spicy goodness and it's whatever so
that's<00:03:30.180> it<00:03:30.359> and<00:03:30.840> you<00:03:30.959> can<00:03:31.139> just<00:03:31.170> mix<00:03:31.470> it<00:03:31.650> around

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
that's it and you can just mix it around

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:34.460 
that's it and you can just mix it around
with<00:03:31.950> your<00:03:32.100> hand<00:03:32.310> or<00:03:32.700> with<00:03:33.000> it<00:03:33.150> or<00:03:33.569> if<00:03:33.810> you

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470
