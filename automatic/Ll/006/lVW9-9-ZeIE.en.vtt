00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:06.460
 the face is a very important area 

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:10.549
 because it is our calling card 

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:13.219
 is a very special area the image that 

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:16.359
 demos with our face appearance 

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:19.820
 is fundamental in our relationships 

00:00:16.359 --> 00:00:23.150
 interpersonal and in the flesh game 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:25.580
 very important role the parties when 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:28.460
 the parties suffer a deterioration by the 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:31.059
 over the years or sometimes by 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:33.890
 bad care with regard to that area 

00:00:31.059 --> 00:00:36.800
 or sometimes both combinations of 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:38.620
 both produce deterioration deterioration and 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.320
 an aging 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:44.140
 making us see issues to years with the 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:46.329
 look reached and high now we appear 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:48.160
 as if we were gybing like 

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:50.890
 if we were as if in the night before 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:54.610
 Lu we have already lived gives us an appearance 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:58.210
 very little mobile gives us an aging 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:01:00.640
 generally premature image 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:03.100
 face deteriorates 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:05.140
 and not only 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.939
 the image that we see but in 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:08.830
 sometimes also the eyelids in the 

00:01:06.939 --> 00:01:11.200
 case of the superior compacts the 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:12.759
 eyelids fall off then they start to 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:16.030
 also interfere with our footprint 

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:18.520
 visual then we can not see well 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:20.470
 we have to make efforts of the 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:23.520
 face a certain position to be able to have 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:27.820
 a visual field then adequate 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:30.610
 it's definitely an area of ​​the face is 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:33.280
 a very important area that we have to 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:36.819
 improve fortunately there are techniques 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:39.630
 Surgical very simple that 

00:01:36.819 --> 00:01:41.950
 performed by local anesthesia in which 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:45.399
 we remove in the case of the eyelids 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:47.500
 lower the bags of fat that with 

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:49.659
 over the years or with the bad 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:52.060
 care we have then they go 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:55.929
 sending building and they are doing 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:59.490
 visible that looks aesthetically ugly and 

00:01:55.929 --> 00:02:01.770
 also it will interfere with 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.899
 and visual acuity 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.570
 in the case of higher births, 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:09.810
 births fall then we have to 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:12.930
 perform surgery by removing the skin 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:16.610
 excess skin and repositioning the 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:19.830
 muscle to give you youthful appearance 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:24.140
 improve the visual field and give a 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:24.140
 much better face appearance
