through<00:02:14.870> I<00:02:15.170> just<00:02:16.040> got<00:02:16.220> done<00:02:16.400> with<00:02:16.550> the<00:02:16.610> first

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880 
through I just got done with the first

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:18.550 
through I just got done with the first
one<00:02:17.150> it's<00:02:17.480> pretty<00:02:17.720> much<00:02:17.900> the<00:02:17.960> prologue<00:02:18.530> to

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
one it's pretty much the prologue to

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.510 
one it's pretty much the prologue to
training<00:02:20.230> it<00:02:21.230> gets<00:02:21.440> a<00:02:21.530> little<00:02:21.680> intense<00:02:21.830> right

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:22.520 
training it gets a little intense right

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:27.190 
training it gets a little intense right
after<00:02:22.850> that<00:02:24.760> the<00:02:25.760> only<00:02:25.910> downside<00:02:26.420> is<00:02:26.450> if<00:02:27.050> you

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
after that the only downside is if you

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.370 
after that the only downside is if you
do<00:02:27.410> not<00:02:27.590> complete<00:02:28.400> the<00:02:28.720> level<00:02:29.720> you<00:02:30.080> end<00:02:30.260> up

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:30.380 
do not complete the level you end up

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
dying there's a time marker that has to

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.590 
dying there's a time marker that has to
count<00:02:33.080> down<00:02:33.380> for<00:02:33.830> you<00:02:34.010> to<00:02:34.220> be<00:02:34.940> able<00:02:34.970> to<00:02:35.240> restart

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:35.600 
count down for you to be able to restart

count down for you to be able to restart
the<00:02:35.690> level<00:02:35.900> unless<00:02:36.320> you<00:02:37.070> want<00:02:37.250> to<00:02:37.370> spend<00:02:37.550> some

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000
