00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:22.330 
why would really like to bring his rook
to<00:04:18.979> e1<00:04:19.220> and<00:04:19.970> add<00:04:20.870> more<00:04:21.199> pressure<00:04:21.500> what<00:04:22.070> white

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:22.340 
to e1 and add more pressure what white

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:28.060 
to e1 and add more pressure what white
should<00:04:22.820> do<00:04:23.180> is<00:04:23.509> bring<00:04:24.289> his<00:04:24.560> Knight<00:04:24.889> to<00:04:25.310> c3<00:04:27.070> put

should do is bring his Knight to c3 put

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:31.210 
should do is bring his Knight to c3 put
on<00:04:28.250> pressure<00:04:29.470> put<00:04:30.470> pressure<00:04:30.710> on<00:04:30.889> the<00:04:31.009> knight

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:31.220 
on pressure put pressure on the knight

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:35.710 
on pressure put pressure on the knight
on<00:04:31.250> e4<00:04:32.060> like<00:04:32.330> that<00:04:32.599> but<00:04:33.699> this<00:04:34.699> is<00:04:34.759> a<00:04:34.940> trap<00:04:35.360> so<00:04:35.690> a

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:35.720 
on e4 like that but this is a trap so a

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:38.050 
on e4 like that but this is a trap so a
trap<00:04:36.199> means<00:04:36.590> that<00:04:36.889> one<00:04:37.340> of<00:04:37.490> the<00:04:37.580> players<00:04:37.789> is

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:38.060 
trap means that one of the players is

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:40.120 
trap means that one of the players is
going<00:04:38.270> to<00:04:38.360> be<00:04:38.449> making<00:04:38.659> a<00:04:38.870> mistake<00:04:38.990> and<00:04:39.530> in<00:04:40.009> the

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:40.130 
going to be making a mistake and in the

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:42.430 
going to be making a mistake and in the
marshal<00:04:40.610> trap<00:04:40.940> the<00:04:41.720> mistake<00:04:42.080> is<00:04:42.199> going<00:04:42.349> to

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:42.440 
marshal trap the mistake is going to

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:44.589 
marshal trap the mistake is going to
come<00:04:42.650> from<00:04:42.830> white<00:04:43.070> moving<00:04:43.430> his<00:04:43.729> rook<00:04:44.030> to<00:04:44.270> e1

00:04:44.589 --> 00:04:44.599 
come from white moving his rook to e1

00:04:44.599 --> 00:04:46.510 
come from white moving his rook to e1
thinking<00:04:45.409> it's<00:04:45.560> a<00:04:45.680> good<00:04:45.710> development<00:04:46.250> move

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:46.520 
thinking it's a good development move

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:48.730 
thinking it's a good development move
bringing<00:04:47.000> his<00:04:47.120> knight<00:04:47.360> to<00:04:47.630> an<00:04:47.780> open<00:04:48.139> file<00:04:48.409> here

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:48.740 
bringing his knight to an open file here

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:50.740 
bringing his knight to an open file here
but<00:04:49.250> actually<00:04:49.580> it's<00:04:49.729> going<00:04:49.820> to<00:04:49.940> spell<00:04:50.389> doom

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:50.750 
but actually it's going to spell doom

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:54.070 
but actually it's going to spell doom
for<00:04:51.039> the<00:04:52.039> white<00:04:52.370> from<00:04:52.639> here<00:04:52.970> black<00:04:53.210> has<00:04:53.330> the

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:54.080 
for the white from here black has the

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:58.480 
for the white from here black has the
great<00:04:54.440> sacrifice<00:04:55.039> of<00:04:55.340> Bishop<00:04:56.030> to<00:04:56.889> h2<00:04:57.889> check

00:04:58.480 --> 00:04:58.490 
great sacrifice of Bishop to h2 check

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:02.680 
great sacrifice of Bishop to h2 check
and<00:04:58.820> then<00:04:59.659> after<00:05:00.520> white<00:05:01.520> cannot<00:05:01.969> capture<00:05:02.240> with

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:02.690 
and then after white cannot capture with

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:06.490 
and then after white cannot capture with
his<00:05:03.550> knight<00:05:04.550> here<00:05:04.909> because<00:05:05.300> again<00:05:05.630> his<00:05:06.169> queen

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:06.500 
his knight here because again his queen

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:08.709 
his knight here because again his queen
is<00:05:06.770> pinned<00:05:07.310> down<00:05:07.550> so<00:05:07.969> if<00:05:08.090> you<00:05:08.270> were<00:05:08.389> to<00:05:08.509> capture

00:05:08.709 --> 00:05:08.719 
is pinned down so if you were to capture

00:05:08.719 --> 00:05:11.529 
is pinned down so if you were to capture
this<00:05:09.590> bishop<00:05:09.949> on<00:05:10.070> h2<00:05:10.550> then<00:05:10.940> black<00:05:11.240> could

00:05:11.529 --> 00:05:11.539 
this bishop on h2 then black could

00:05:11.539 --> 00:05:14.680 
this bishop on h2 then black could
simply<00:05:12.020> take<00:05:12.770> this<00:05:13.070> Queen<00:05:13.580> on<00:05:13.759> d1<00:05:13.969> that's<00:05:14.449> not

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:14.690 
simply take this Queen on d1 that's not

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:16.810 
simply take this Queen on d1 that's not
going<00:05:14.840> to<00:05:14.900> be<00:05:14.990> very<00:05:15.139> good<00:05:15.440> for<00:05:15.680> white<00:05:15.919> so

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:16.820 
going to be very good for white so

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:20.480 
going to be very good for white so
instead<00:05:17.270> after<00:05:17.479> the<00:05:17.810> King<00:05:18.349> captures<00:05:18.860> on<00:05:19.070> h2

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:20.490 
instead after the King captures on h2

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:24.529 
instead after the King captures on h2
then<00:05:20.729> black<00:05:21.360> can<00:05:21.750> come<00:05:22.110> to<00:05:22.500> F<00:05:23.100> to<00:05:23.819> capture<00:05:24.389> this

00:05:24.529 --> 00:05:24.539 
then black can come to F to capture this

00:05:24.539 --> 00:05:27.559 
then black can come to F to capture this
pawn<00:05:24.780> at<00:05:25.110> the<00:05:25.199> same<00:05:25.440> time<00:05:25.940> attacking<00:05:26.940> both<00:05:27.330> the
