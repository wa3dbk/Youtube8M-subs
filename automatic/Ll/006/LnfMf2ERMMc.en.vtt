00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
but I tell us a little bit about how

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.670 
but I tell us a little bit about how
this<00:02:05.250> course<00:02:05.430> plays<00:02:05.729> out<00:02:06.500> from<00:02:07.500> what<00:02:07.649> I

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
this course plays out from what I

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.990 
this course plays out from what I
remember<00:02:08.149> last<00:02:09.149> year<00:02:09.450> was<00:02:09.690> wet<00:02:10.020> the<00:02:10.800> moisture

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
remember last year was wet the moisture

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.430 
remember last year was wet the moisture
made<00:02:12.720> it<00:02:12.870> a<00:02:12.960> cold<00:02:13.260> cold<00:02:14.250> start<00:02:14.670> and<00:02:15.440> actually

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
made it a cold cold start and actually

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.380 
made it a cold cold start and actually
went<00:02:16.800> off<00:02:16.890> course<00:02:17.250> after<00:02:17.910> the<00:02:18.000> first<00:02:18.210> couple

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
went off course after the first couple

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.140 
went off course after the first couple
miles<00:02:18.750> so<00:02:19.050> I<00:02:19.080> had<00:02:19.290> to<00:02:19.320> play<00:02:19.530> catch-up<00:02:19.970> the<00:02:20.970> rest

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
miles so I had to play catch-up the rest

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:22.850 
miles so I had to play catch-up the rest
of<00:02:21.270> the<00:02:21.390> ray<00:02:21.540> or<00:02:21.840> not<00:02:22.170> the<00:02:22.290> rest<00:02:22.440> of<00:02:22.590> the<00:02:22.680> race

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
of the ray or not the rest of the race

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.960 
of the ray or not the rest of the race
but<00:02:23.100> for<00:02:23.430> a<00:02:23.580> good<00:02:23.820> bit<00:02:24.030> and<00:02:25.490> hoping<00:02:26.490> to<00:02:26.610> not<00:02:26.760> do

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
but for a good bit and hoping to not do

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.260 
but for a good bit and hoping to not do
that<00:02:27.150> this<00:02:27.540> go-round<00:02:27.780> I<00:02:28.260> think<00:02:28.640> yeah<00:02:29.640> knowing

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
that this go-round I think yeah knowing

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:32.510 
that this go-round I think yeah knowing
the<00:02:30.420> course<00:02:30.660> will<00:02:31.290> play<00:02:31.709> to<00:02:31.770> my<00:02:31.980> favor<00:02:32.220> a
