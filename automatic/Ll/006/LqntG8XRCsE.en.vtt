00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.940
 I have a personal galaxy note 10.1 

00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:11.300
 here at hand is the goal of this life is 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:14.639
 people test the capacity of this device 

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:16.859
 that Samsung recently launched the 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:19.380
 to test the capacity of this 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:21.630
 solve mathematical equations 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.529
 we know it comes with the software 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:28.080
 is able to solve mathematical equations 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:30.210
 Let's see if this really works is if 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.840
 to function 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.660
 if it works well then we can 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.879
 say it's a very good tool 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:44.629
 for the right engineering students 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:44.629
 for statistical mathematicians and seriously 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.170
 Let me out of here from netflix 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:57.719
 good I'm already here at hand 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:01:02.030
 with this time we go the application 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:02.030
 it's called that death 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.050
 O 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:23.469
 good it will only work here function ready 

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:23.469
 come on 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:30.650
 2 more pains let's start with the basics 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:32.420
 You can see that he's already 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:35.030
 recognized above 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:36.760
 Instantly 2002 I wrote in 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:46.100
 low 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:47.090
 search good here two plus two 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:52.580
 results 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:55.940
 act is a man of number four is that 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:02:00.020
 value on his chart right is a 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:08.179
 good point beauty, success 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:08.840
 let's see now but something in the first 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:14.270
 degree 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:17.860
 sure the best of the first - degree equation 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:21.370
 so let me see here how it is 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:21.370
 delete it here 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:36.690
 ready 

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:38.220
 Let's see now 2x plus six equals 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:44.690
 zero 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:44.690
 Just search. 

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:55.400
 here the Chinese made 1 to 0 the chart nÃ© 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:02.460
 alternative way to enroll in this 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:08.520
 simplifying two or three theaters 3 in 

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:10.500
 1 to 0 result or xv is equal to less 

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:17.840
 three ne 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:17.840
 the number on the vine is very nice here 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:22.340
 the right chart 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:33.740
 well let's now see an equation of 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:33.740
 right high school 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.810
 Look here 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:53.920
 let's go x squared more 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:15.910
 Here I correct my very letter 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:23.810
 cold x squared plus laws x but not 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:32.199
 I will have staff again soon wrote 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:42.770
 now right here is x squared more 

00:04:32.199 --> 00:04:45.620
 3 x 1 x 1 square plus three plus one is 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:49.419
 good search to see the results of the 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:49.419
 roots and graph 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:05:11.770
 good is the right jack right is perfect 

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:14.140
 a parable is a parable is this 

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:18.280
 here is the graph plotted with an x and 

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:20.440
 below 30 is a plotted graph 

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:26.470
 with you can see for ends minus 20 

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:29.740
 up to 15 geometric figure parabola 

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:39.490
 alternative ways to write equation 

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:41.970
 and the roots certain effect Sunday personal 

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:41.970
 real 

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:50.430
 much training information is not 

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:54.550
 end up more 

00:05:50.430 --> 00:06:03.810
 well let's now see his ability to 

00:05:54.550 --> 00:06:03.810
 solve a full right let's go there 

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:09.300
 integral 

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:15.490
 has won 

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:27.090
 integral of x to the square of x 

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:44.760
 Ok perfect, thanks to guarani x 

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:49.360
 x to cube under three plus one constant 

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:58.000
 here the graph is that trace is 

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:59.650
 really is perfect is very good, let's go 

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.170
 see now hold high 

00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:04.690
 Certain he solved it, let's go. 

00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:10.290
 put his version weight on that x to 

00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:13.290
 square is x okubo sorry about three 

00:07:10.290 --> 00:07:13.290
 right
