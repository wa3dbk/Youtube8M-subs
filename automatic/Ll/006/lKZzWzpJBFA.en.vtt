 Well dressed baby Now for 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.140
 the office that caring conscious 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.809
 moms and dads should put in the briefcase 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:12.240
 the children of the first class and 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.460
 how to make it all so 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.130
 better and cheaper 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:19.230
 firstly before you buy something 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.840
 ask the future teacher for a list 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.240
 what does the child need it will spare you 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.519
 from wasting your time and money 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.230
 the baby will not have to drag on September 1 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.390
 knapsack at the stationery shop where 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.550
 among the many completely unnecessary things 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.760
 Of course, not necessarily 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:38.100
 the most necessary to buy stationery 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.969
 the stalls are not worth the first stingy 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.040
 pays twice 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:43.770
 and secondly it is not known where from what 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.149
 materials they made such rulers 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.789
 notebook erasers may not 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.030
 meet basic requirements 

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:49.770
 security 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.360
 however add to bag 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.890
 first grader expensive written 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.190

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:58.020
 office supplies also should not you 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.949
 you will be surprised but soon 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:03.780
 time almost everything will have to buy again 

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:07.400
 will break be lost for will not return 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.400
 very scrupulous and classmates 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:13.900
 in the compulsory first-grader set 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:16.570
 pens come in blue colored pencils and 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:18.220
 simple colored eraser ruler notebook 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:20.650
 cell and thin ruller 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:22.600
 diary counting sticks albums for 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:24.850
 paint and brush drawing 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:27.910
 colored paper cardboard cardboard glue 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:30.040
 scissors plasticine board for sculpting this 

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:32.550
 approximate minimum list each 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:34.930
 school complements it on your own 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:36.520
 exercise books in first grade are used in 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:39.100
 slanting ruler and in the box with 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:41.440
 classic covers are better if you 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:43.390
 take notebooks of different colors then 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:46.300
 first grader will be easier to find the right 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:48.220
 pen notebook for schoolchild 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:50.650
 preferred ordinary ballpoint pen 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:53.200
 worth rod for it is much cheaper 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:55.720
 than gel and spelled them several times 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.710
 longer what you need to pay attention 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:59.229
 so it's size 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:01.720
 don't take bulky heavy handles for 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:04.300
 child lettering elements and so 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:07.030
 hard work so easy standard 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:08.830
 pen is the best choice usually when 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.600
 prospector letter to us sweat fingers 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:11.590
 therefore, it is desirable that the pen be 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.959
 rubber bezel 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:16.300
 which will not allow them to slide on 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:18.850
 take at least 10 pens at first 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:21.120
 they somehow miraculously disappear 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:24.550
 about canisters about once a week 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:27.130
 pencils are also worth taking the most ordinary 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:29.110
 medium hard given that they are 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:31.540
 break into a case worth putting right away 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:33.190
 two simple pencils and of course not 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:35.260
 forget about color pencils 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:37.690
 sets now there is a great 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:39.700
 so many again I want to urge 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:42.220
 moms and dads ready to please your child 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:45.550
 be prudent to buy a baby 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:48.040
 a set of 48 or 56 pencils worth it 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:48.550
 it is not profitable from an economic point 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.310
 of view 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:53.019
 10 is enough for any drawing 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:58.959
 12 colored pencils 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:03:01.090
 the same applies to the markers now 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:03.100
 case essential content detail 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:04.840
 portfolio for a first grader optimal 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.970
 multi-compartment case 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:09.400
 where each item will lie in on 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:11.500
 in its place it will teach the child to 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.840
 order exclude inconvenience when searching 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:16.120
 the right thing for colored pencils 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:20.280
 brushes and markers better to purchase 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:20.280
 separate addition lock case 

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:24.580
 for drawing work 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:26.980
 must be purchased watercolor paint 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:27.580
 and tassels cup plasticine board for 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:30.100
 sculptures 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:30.840
 a set of colored paper glue and several 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:33.760
 of albums 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:36.220
 still have to choose safe scissors 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:38.170
 several folders with sharpener buttons 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:44.160
 cover erasers for notebooks and textbooks 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:46.930
 and something else oh yeah diary for the fives 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:49.960
 this whole rack is made than you 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:52.750
 thought the performance diaries true 

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:53.670
 eyes run up diaries have on any 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:57.960
 taste and color 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:04:00.220
 want with berries want with flowers 

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:04.000
 boys will be glad to have this 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:06.640
 diary with a machine but girls just 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.290
 will be happy to have a diary with a kitten 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:10.150
 the main thing to consider when choosing 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:12.420
 diary for a first grader 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:15.700
 it is intended from this diary 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:20.760
 just for elementary school about it 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:20.760
 usually there is a marking on diary 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:33.020
 for my fives this diary will do 

00:04:30.309 --> 00:04:36.319
 everything you need is finally purchased 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:38.719
 before you a new problem all this is necessary 

00:04:36.319 --> 00:04:41.300
 in something to pack it means baby 

00:04:38.719 --> 00:04:43.309
 necessary briefcase don't fall for 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:46.219
 provocations of a small participant in the process 

00:04:43.309 --> 00:04:48.770
 buy that beautiful handbag instead 

00:04:46.219 --> 00:04:50.680
 satchels wear gravity on one shoulder or 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:53.240
 in one hand harmful to the child’s posture 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:54.139
 Your baby’s backpack is really 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:56.270
 will be heavy 

00:04:54.139 --> 00:04:59.659
 therefore, the choice of rank is to come 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:03.139
 very seriously what should be 

00:04:59.659 --> 00:05:05.059
 briefcase lightweight empty 

00:05:03.139 --> 00:05:07.249
 must not exceed 700 grams 

00:05:05.059 --> 00:05:08.229
 the contents of the portfolio already has 

00:05:07.249 --> 00:05:10.459
 impressive weight 

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:12.849
 the back wall of the knapsack should tight 

00:05:10.459 --> 00:05:15.699
 fit to the back to have a soft pad 

00:05:12.849 --> 00:05:18.699
 straps should be strong and wide 

00:05:15.699 --> 00:05:21.439
 narrow straps will crash into the shoulders 

00:05:18.699 --> 00:05:24.110
 See that the clasps are not very 

00:05:21.439 --> 00:05:26.689
 France should be a lot tight 

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:28.430
 pockets and compartments then each 

00:05:26.689 --> 00:05:30.800
 little things in the household of the student there 

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:31.789
 place pens will not get lost notebooks 

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:34.129
 textbooks meat 

00:05:31.789 --> 00:05:35.089
 and the apple can be put separately 

00:05:34.129 --> 00:05:37.430
 from replacement shoes 

00:05:35.089 --> 00:05:39.649
 and of course the schoolbag is just 

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:41.990
 must be strong endure him 

00:05:39.649 --> 00:05:44.360
 there will be many on it will sit in 

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:45.559
 corridors on the reverse ride from a hill 

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:48.169
 winter after school 

00:05:45.559 --> 00:05:50.689
 he'll be thrown and kicked at last just 

00:05:48.169 --> 00:05:52.419
 throw somewhere good if the portfolio 

00:05:50.689 --> 00:05:55.399
 made of easy washable material 

00:05:52.419 --> 00:05:57.860
 after all after all the above tests 

00:05:55.399 --> 00:06:00.619
 he will quickly become dirty even very 

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:03.259
 dirty besides 

00:06:00.619 --> 00:06:05.749
 you need to buy two ware 

00:06:03.259 --> 00:06:08.110
 bags for interchangeable shoes and sports 

00:06:05.749 --> 00:06:08.110
 forms 

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:16.880
 Well, perhaps all of us are basically 

00:06:13.669 --> 00:06:19.490

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:22.030
 accounting textbooks wish you a pleasant 

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:22.030
