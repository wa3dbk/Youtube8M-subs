00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.179
 hello my name is mike and I 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.850
 works in the helpdesk 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:07.379
 hunter technique today we 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.700
 let's see how to adjust a sprinkler 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:10.700
 rotating pgp 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:17.480
 so we have the setting of sprinklers 

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:20.450
 rotative in this example is the pgp 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:22.130
 classic to do both settings 

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:25.550
 we will use the tuning key 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:27.380
 hunter this key at both ends the 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:29.240
 wrong key on one side that is used to 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:31.310
 the setting of the ray and a tea in 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:34.610
 plastic on the opposite side for adjustment 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:36.739
 of the sector to adjust the radius 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:39.019
 look for the raised arrow on the 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:42.519
 rubber cap and it says 

00:00:39.019 --> 00:00:42.519
 the location of the orifice for the nozzle 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:47.399
 place the wrong key in the arrow in 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:47.399
 relief 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:53.090
 and turn the screw clockwise 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:55.430
 in front of the nozzle to expand lodge 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:57.680
 or counter - clockwise a half-turn 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:01.450
 at a turn about you get more than 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.450
 distance but it's the radius setting 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:07.280
 the setting of the sector for the moment 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.620
 lined up here in the middle of the 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.760
 lawn but the right stop and the point 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:14.400
 fixed 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.380
 the nozzle and already firmly attached to the 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.480
 tube placed underneath so the device 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.900
 himself does not just move his head 

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:20.900
 rotating 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.680
 for now we have a little more 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.740
 90 degrees again the beauty 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.060
 right and the fixed point 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:32.190
 I use the plastic tea of ​​the key 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:35.070
 and you see that the other orifices at the 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:37.460
 circle + and - 6 for setting the 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.460
 sector 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.479
 insert the key is turned the 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:46.130
 slightly you feel it falling into the 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.130
 slot and you know it's up 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:51.070
 if you want to increase the circle to 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:52.680
 beyond 90 degrees turn the key in the 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:55.210
 positive meaning 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.220
 you can check where you are in 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:00.960
 holding the head up to the butte and fixed 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:00.960
 right which is always constant 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:06.499
 I turn them in the positive direction and 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:08.420
 so we have to increase the circle so 

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:11.209
 I want to decrease the circle I go in 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:12.950
 counterclockwise or negative sense and 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:14.569
 we go back to the butte fx which is a 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:17.170
 given and now we no longer 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:17.170
 that these degrees 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:25.720
 otherwise increase or decrease the side 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:29.790
 right fx is your more or less is going 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.790
 open or close the left stop
