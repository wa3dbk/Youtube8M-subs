00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.339 
to prepare for our demonstration I'm
making<00:00:11.280> eight-inch<00:00:11.820> blocks<00:00:12.240> for<00:00:12.780> red<00:00:13.019> and

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
making eight-inch blocks for red and

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.770 
making eight-inch blocks for red and
white<00:00:13.590> fabric<00:00:14.130> combinations<00:00:14.370> of<00:00:15.089> course<00:00:15.540> you

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
white fabric combinations of course you

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.080 
white fabric combinations of course you
can<00:00:15.929> use<00:00:16.109> any<00:00:16.379> color<00:00:16.680> you<00:00:16.890> want<00:00:17.070> but<00:00:17.910> I've

can use any color you want but I've
prepared<00:00:18.600> by<00:00:19.289> cutting<00:00:19.859> from<00:00:20.789> each<00:00:21.090> of<00:00:21.390> the

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
prepared by cutting from each of the

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.910 
prepared by cutting from each of the
fabrics<00:00:22.050> a<00:00:22.289> seven<00:00:23.250> and<00:00:23.460> a<00:00:23.640> half<00:00:23.670> inch<00:00:24.180> square

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:24.920 
fabrics a seven and a half inch square

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:28.720 
fabrics a seven and a half inch square
I've<00:00:25.920> cut<00:00:26.279> the<00:00:26.490> square<00:00:26.820> diagonally<00:00:27.720> one<00:00:28.050> time

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:28.730 
I've cut the square diagonally one time

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:33.500 
I've cut the square diagonally one time
I've<00:00:29.730> also<00:00:30.060> cut<00:00:30.710> narrow<00:00:31.710> strips<00:00:32.340> inch<00:00:33.210> and<00:00:33.480> a

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
I've also cut narrow strips inch and a

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.740 
I've also cut narrow strips inch and a
half<00:00:33.540> wide<00:00:33.800> from<00:00:34.800> each<00:00:35.070> color<00:00:35.430> and<00:00:35.790> I've<00:00:36.480> cut

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
half wide from each color and I've cut

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.470 
half wide from each color and I've cut
three<00:00:37.320> and<00:00:37.590> three<00:00:38.040> quarter<00:00:38.489> inch<00:00:38.670> wide<00:00:38.969> strips

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
three and three quarter inch wide strips

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.600 
three and three quarter inch wide strips
from<00:00:40.140> each<00:00:40.320> color<00:00:40.680> so<00:00:41.480> the<00:00:42.480> narrow<00:00:42.780> white<00:00:43.200> one

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:43.610 
from each color so the narrow white one

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:48.889 
from each color so the narrow white one
to<00:00:44.610> the<00:00:44.910> wide<00:00:45.180> red<00:00:45.930> one<00:00:46.879> so<00:00:47.879> the<00:00:48.180> narrow<00:00:48.480> red

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
to the wide red one so the narrow red

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:54.650 
to the wide red one so the narrow red
one<00:00:49.170> to<00:00:50.070> the<00:00:50.309> wide<00:00:50.550> white<00:00:51.329> strip<00:00:52.730> you<00:00:53.730> need<00:00:53.969> two

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
one to the wide white strip you need two

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.920 
one to the wide white strip you need two
of<00:00:55.050> each<00:00:55.530> combination<00:00:56.399> when<00:00:57.180> you<00:00:57.329> make<00:00:57.539> strip

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
of each combination when you make strip

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.560 
of each combination when you make strip
sets<00:00:58.199> like<00:00:58.410> this<00:00:58.710> you<00:00:59.129> will<00:00:59.280> get<00:00:59.460> six<00:01:00.030> to<00:01:00.359> eight

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
sets like this you will get six to eight

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.700 
sets like this you will get six to eight
pieces<00:01:01.020> or<00:01:01.590> cuts<00:01:02.460> from<00:01:03.000> each<00:01:03.390> strip<00:01:03.809> set<00:01:04.080> the

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
pieces or cuts from each strip set the

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.850 
pieces or cuts from each strip set the
strip<00:01:05.010> sets<00:01:05.339> can<00:01:05.670> be<00:01:05.729> variable<00:01:06.689> in<00:01:07.080> length<00:01:07.350> but

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
strip sets can be variable in length but

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.100 
strip sets can be variable in length but
typically<00:01:08.280> they<00:01:08.610> run<00:01:08.880> selvedge<00:01:09.420> to<00:01:09.450> selvedge

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
typically they run selvedge to selvedge

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.510 
typically they run selvedge to selvedge
roughly<00:01:11.150> 44<00:01:12.150> inches<00:01:12.479> wide<00:01:13.220> remember<00:01:14.220> we're

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
roughly 44 inches wide remember we're

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.070 
roughly 44 inches wide remember we're
making<00:01:14.670> mirror<00:01:15.270> image<00:01:15.780> sets<00:01:16.200> and<00:01:17.420> we<00:01:18.420> need<00:01:18.630> two

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
making mirror image sets and we need two

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.030 
making mirror image sets and we need two
of<00:01:19.710> the<00:01:20.159> strip<00:01:20.490> sets<00:01:20.790> to<00:01:21.330> make<00:01:21.360> these<00:01:21.890> when<00:01:22.890> the

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
of the strip sets to make these when the

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.550 
of the strip sets to make these when the
strip<00:01:23.310> sets<00:01:23.610> are<00:01:23.820> stitched<00:01:24.180> you<00:01:25.080> want<00:01:25.320> to

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
strip sets are stitched you want to

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.539 
strip sets are stitched you want to
press<00:01:26.780> with<00:01:27.780> one<00:01:28.080> of<00:01:28.229> the<00:01:28.350> seams<00:01:28.650> towards<00:01:29.340> the

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
press with one of the seams towards the

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.440 
press with one of the seams towards the
wide<00:01:29.820> strip<00:01:30.450> and<00:01:30.950> the<00:01:31.950> second<00:01:32.490> strip<00:01:32.820> set<00:01:33.119> will

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
wide strip and the second strip set will

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.280 
wide strip and the second strip set will
be<00:01:33.570> pressed<00:01:33.930> towards<00:01:34.500> the<00:01:34.740> narrow<00:01:35.040> strip<00:01:35.579> set

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:36.290 
be pressed towards the narrow strip set

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:40.130 
be pressed towards the narrow strip set
you'll<00:01:37.290> make<00:01:37.560> pairs<00:01:38.189> of<00:01:38.579> strip<00:01:38.970> sets<00:01:39.299> for<00:01:39.869> all

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
you'll make pairs of strip sets for all

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.990 
you'll make pairs of strip sets for all
of<00:01:40.380> the<00:01:40.500> color<00:01:40.710> combinations<00:01:41.070> in<00:01:41.850> the

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
of the color combinations in the

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.539 
of the color combinations in the
collection<00:01:42.570> in<00:01:42.979> preparation<00:01:43.979> to<00:01:44.130> cut<00:01:44.369> the

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
collection in preparation to cut the

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.240 
collection in preparation to cut the
strip's<00:01:44.880> you're<00:01:45.600> going<00:01:45.960> to<00:01:46.170> lay<00:01:46.740> the<00:01:46.979> strip

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
strip's you're going to lay the strip

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.510

sets right sides together the seams will
Nestle<00:01:51.090> together

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
Nestle together

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.490 
Nestle together
