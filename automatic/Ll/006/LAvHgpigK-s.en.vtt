00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.040
 today we are going to talk about a 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:06.569
 curiosity about green olives 

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:09.630
 the green olives are not so 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:12.000
 natural as you think to be able to get there 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:15.030
 to be consumed by the human being 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.760
 a very long and tedious process in the 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:21.060
 which are treated with bleach to 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:24.630
 eliminate some substances that are not 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:26.699
 appropriate to start let's say that the 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:30.630
 green olive that we know of all the 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:33.390
 life is not ripped out at the time the 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.570
 that is mature is ripped off at the moment 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:40.079
 in which the olive has not yet matured 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:43.910
 and subsequently it is introduced and 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.910
 bathe in a kind of 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:50.490
 of the liquid the hydroxide is removed 

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:54.120
 first of all and then they dive into 

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:56.550
 highly concentrated saline to 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:01:00.060
 sugar is added after several weeks 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:03.500
 to maintain the fermentation and then 

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:06.260
 of nothing more and nothing less than six months 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:09.540
 fermenting yourself in this saline solution 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:11.880
 combined with some sugar it is 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:15.400
 when they link when they get in 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:18.550
 cans and proceeds 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:21.530
 it is proceeded to its basement and its 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:23.960
 distribution to the general population 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:25.580
 therefore we can not say that if a 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.860
 person for example wants to take a 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:29.750
 olive of an olive tree can make it 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:34.130
 free way and get an olive 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:38.000
 green this is not so to be able to carry 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:40.909
 out the ingestion of a green olive is 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.369
 necessary that before carry out a 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:45.020
 series of treatments that are quite 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:49.299
 expensive and they last a whopping 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:49.299
 amount of six months 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:56.990
 so an immature olive would be 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:59.210
 inedible to who would think the 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:01.880
 idea of ​​treating a product with bleach 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:04.250
 to make it edible that's what 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:06.830
 I wonder the truth is that there is no 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:08.509
 no data any reference that we 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:10.700
 let me know when they started 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:13.250
 treat these olives for 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:16.190
 turn them into olives of 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:18.260
 human consumption in very rich olives 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:21.410
 so to speak if by some chance 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:25.100
 to try is to eat a green olive without 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:27.530
 mature would be tremendously disgusting 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:30.320
 or for Paul to be edible 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:32.030
 so that the human being does not spit it out is 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:36.050
 necessary as I said to pass 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:38.570
 six months of non-stop treatments and 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:41.420
 subsequently it is at that time when 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:45.250
 the human being can consume it with a 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:45.250
 more or less pleasant flavor
