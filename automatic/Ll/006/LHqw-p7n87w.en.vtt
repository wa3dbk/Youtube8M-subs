relatively<00:00:51.000> cheap<00:00:51.300> but<00:00:51.809> the<00:00:51.960> one<00:00:52.170> reason<00:00:52.350> why

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
relatively cheap but the one reason why

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.319 
relatively cheap but the one reason why
i<00:00:52.620> use<00:00:52.949> that<00:00:53.160> is<00:00:53.309> because<00:00:53.640> it<00:00:53.760> elevates<00:00:54.149> my

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.510 
i use that is because it elevates my
thumb<00:00:54.539> that<00:00:55.020> way<00:00:55.199> allows<00:00:55.469> me<00:00:55.620> to<00:00:55.710> eat<00:00:55.890> easier
