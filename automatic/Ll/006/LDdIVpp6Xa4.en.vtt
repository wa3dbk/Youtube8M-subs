super<00:00:23.340> science<00:00:24.000> station<00:00:24.619> that<00:00:25.619> sounds<00:00:26.099> cool

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
super science station that sounds cool

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.269 
super science station that sounds cool
but<00:00:26.430> where<00:00:27.330> is<00:00:27.539> it<00:00:27.750> and<00:00:27.960> how<00:00:28.500> do<00:00:28.560> we<00:00:28.710> get<00:00:29.010> there

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
but where is it and how do we get there

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.209 
but where is it and how do we get there
just<00:00:29.580> close<00:00:30.359> your<00:00:30.420> eyes<00:00:30.779> and<00:00:31.260> repeat<00:00:31.500> after<00:00:31.980> me

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
just close your eyes and repeat after me

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.750 
just close your eyes and repeat after me
there's<00:00:33.120> no<00:00:33.510> subject<00:00:33.989> like<00:00:34.440> science<00:00:35.040> there's

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
there's no subject like science there's

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:54.340 
there's no subject like science there's
no<00:00:36.149> subject<00:00:36.660> like<00:00:37.200> science<00:00:37.950> there's<00:00:38.640> no

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:54.350 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:58.280 

whoa<00:00:55.350> this<00:00:56.250> is<00:00:56.489> no<00:00:56.670> ordinary<00:00:57.030> science<00:00:57.840> lab

00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:58.290 
whoa this is no ordinary science lab

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:03.770 
whoa this is no ordinary science lab
you've<00:00:59.010> got<00:00:59.340> that<00:00:59.579> right<00:01:02.629> scientists<00:01:03.629> have

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
you've got that right scientists have

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.040 
you've got that right scientists have
built<00:01:04.019> special<00:01:04.710> tools<00:01:05.040> to<00:01:05.280> look<00:01:05.700> at<00:01:05.970> atoms<00:01:06.479> but

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:07.050 
built special tools to look at atoms but

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:09.920 
built special tools to look at atoms but
even<00:01:07.440> with<00:01:07.590> an<00:01:07.740> electron<00:01:08.460> microscope<00:01:08.930> atoms

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
even with an electron microscope atoms

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.580 
even with an electron microscope atoms
still<00:01:10.290> look<00:01:10.590> kind<00:01:10.950> of<00:01:11.250> fuzzy<00:01:11.990> so<00:01:12.990> let's<00:01:13.290> look

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
still look kind of fuzzy so let's look

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.630 
still look kind of fuzzy so let's look
at<00:01:13.860> this<00:01:14.100> model<00:01:14.520> of<00:01:14.970> an<00:01:15.090> atom<00:01:15.270> of<00:01:15.659> helium

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:16.640 
at this model of an atom of helium

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.490 
at this model of an atom of helium
that's<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:17.880> gas<00:01:18.150> that<00:01:18.420> makes<00:01:18.690> balloons<00:01:19.110> float

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
that's the gas that makes balloons float

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.090 
that's the gas that makes balloons float
ah<00:01:20.180> it<00:01:21.180> looks<00:01:21.240> like<00:01:21.750> the<00:01:21.930> tiny<00:01:22.259> atom<00:01:22.710> is<00:01:22.860> made

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
ah it looks like the tiny atom is made

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.700 
ah it looks like the tiny atom is made
up<00:01:23.220> of<00:01:23.340> even<00:01:23.550> smaller<00:01:24.240> particles<00:01:24.710> that's

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
up of even smaller particles that's

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.210 
up of even smaller particles that's
right<00:01:26.009> the<00:01:27.000> nucleus<00:01:27.690> or<00:01:27.899> centre<00:01:28.890> of<00:01:29.070> the<00:01:29.190> atom

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
right the nucleus or centre of the atom

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.180 
right the nucleus or centre of the atom
is<00:01:29.729> made<00:01:30.180> up<00:01:30.390> of<00:01:30.570> protons<00:01:31.380> which<00:01:31.920> have<00:01:32.160> a

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:32.190 
is made up of protons which have a

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:35.990 
is made up of protons which have a
positive<00:01:33.030> charge<00:01:33.060> and<00:01:34.009> neutrons<00:01:35.009> that<00:01:35.610> don't

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
positive charge and neutrons that don't

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.779 
positive charge and neutrons that don't
have<00:01:36.179> any<00:01:36.390> kind<00:01:36.780> of<00:01:36.929> electric<00:01:37.380> charge<00:01:37.789> the

00:01:38.779 --> 00:01:38.789 
have any kind of electric charge the

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:41.480 
have any kind of electric charge the
number<00:01:39.149> of<00:01:39.300> protons<00:01:39.929> always<00:01:40.679> tells<00:01:41.039> us<00:01:41.310> the

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
number of protons always tells us the

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.810 
number of protons always tells us the
type<00:01:41.820> of<00:01:41.880> element<00:01:42.509> this<00:01:43.410> atom<00:01:43.979> is<00:01:44.160> helium

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
type of element this atom is helium

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:50.139 
type of element this atom is helium
because<00:01:45.179> it<00:01:45.509> has<00:01:45.690> two<00:01:46.080> protons<00:01:48.440> with<00:01:49.440> an

00:01:50.139 --> 00:01:50.149 
because it has two protons with an

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:53.150 
because it has two protons with an
electromagnet<00:01:51.149> when<00:01:51.899> an<00:01:52.020> electric<00:01:52.679> current

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:53.160 
electromagnet when an electric current

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:55.910 
electromagnet when an electric current
passes<00:01:53.820> through<00:01:54.090> these<00:01:54.270> coils<00:01:54.690> it<00:01:55.140> causes<00:01:55.770> the

passes through these coils it causes the

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.080 
passes through these coils it causes the
nail<00:01:56.250> to<00:01:56.670> become<00:01:56.970> a<00:01:57.000> temporary<00:01:57.710> magnet<00:01:58.710> and

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090 
nail to become a temporary magnet and

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:02.840 
nail to become a temporary magnet and
the<00:02:00.090> more<00:02:00.420> coils<00:02:00.780> the<00:02:01.380> stronger<00:02:02.100> the<00:02:02.250> magnetic

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
the more coils the stronger the magnetic

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.960 
the more coils the stronger the magnetic
field<00:02:03.119> but<00:02:03.869> what<00:02:04.079> if<00:02:04.229> you<00:02:04.380> were<00:02:04.530> on<00:02:04.740> the

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:04.970 
field but what if you were on the

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:08.030 
field but what if you were on the
International<00:02:05.970> Space<00:02:06.270> Station<00:02:06.930> we're<00:02:07.680> out<00:02:07.860> on

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:08.040 
International Space Station we're out on

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:10.819 
International Space Station we're out on
a<00:02:08.070> spacewalk<00:02:09.229> gravity<00:02:10.229> wouldn't<00:02:10.530> be<00:02:10.619> so

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:10.829 
a spacewalk gravity wouldn't be so

00:02:10.829 --> 00:02:13.970 
a spacewalk gravity wouldn't be so
strong<00:02:11.340> then<00:02:11.820> I<00:02:12.209> could<00:02:13.019> float<00:02:13.320> around<00:02:13.500> almost

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
strong then I could float around almost

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.330 
strong then I could float around almost
weightless<00:02:14.750> or<00:02:15.750> what<00:02:16.320> if<00:02:16.470> you<00:02:16.650> were<00:02:16.829> on<00:02:17.040> the

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
weightless or what if you were on the

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.690 
weightless or what if you were on the
moon<00:02:17.670> well<00:02:18.540> I<00:02:18.900> wouldn't<00:02:19.380> be<00:02:19.590> weightless<00:02:19.920> but<00:02:20.670> I

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
moon well I wouldn't be weightless but I

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.620 
moon well I wouldn't be weightless but I
would<00:02:21.030> weigh<00:02:21.510> less<00:02:21.590> than<00:02:22.590> I<00:02:22.709> do<00:02:22.769> on<00:02:23.130> earth<00:02:23.630> and

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
would weigh less than I do on earth and

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:27.830 
would weigh less than I do on earth and
I<00:02:24.750> could<00:02:24.959> jump<00:02:25.200> really<00:02:25.680> high<00:02:26.239> that's<00:02:27.239> because

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
I could jump really high that's because

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.259 
I could jump really high that's because
the<00:02:28.260> moon<00:02:28.560> has<00:02:28.590> a<00:02:28.890> smaller<00:02:29.400> mass<00:02:29.850> than<00:02:30.239> the

the moon has a smaller mass than the
