00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:22.880 
hi guys my name is Sun Pierce I'm the

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:24.790 
hi guys my name is Sun Pierce I'm the
founder<00:00:23.240> of<00:00:23.270> a<00:00:23.360> design<00:00:23.630> company<00:00:23.930> and<00:00:24.590> we

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:24.800 
founder of a design company and we

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.430 
founder of a design company and we
produced<00:00:24.980> the<00:00:25.400> live<00:00:25.520> wheel<00:00:25.840> loot<00:00:26.840> wheels<00:00:27.080> our

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:27.440 
produced the live wheel loot wheels our

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:30.520 
produced the live wheel loot wheels our
suspension<00:00:28.100> within<00:00:29.030> the<00:00:29.180> wheel<00:00:29.360> so<00:00:30.289> you<00:00:30.320> can

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:30.530 
suspension within the wheel so you can

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:31.990 
suspension within the wheel so you can
fit<00:00:30.710> one<00:00:30.860> of<00:00:30.950> our<00:00:31.039> wheels<00:00:31.250> to<00:00:31.490> an<00:00:31.580> existing

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:32.000 
fit one of our wheels to an existing

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:56.550 
fit one of our wheels to an existing
bike<00:00:32.210> and<00:00:32.870> you<00:00:32.960> can<00:00:33.170> have<00:00:33.289> full

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:56.560 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:59.710 

so<00:00:57.560> I<00:00:57.590> thought<00:00:57.830> the<00:00:57.920> idea<00:00:58.040> in<00:00:58.610> 2007<00:00:59.480> and<00:00:59.600> did

00:00:59.710 --> 00:00:59.720 
so I thought the idea in 2007 and did

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:01.420 
so I thought the idea in 2007 and did
some<00:00:59.900> sketches<00:01:00.110> but<00:01:00.830> since<00:01:01.070> then<00:01:01.280> the

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:01.430 
some sketches but since then the

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:03.130 
some sketches but since then the
designers<00:01:01.850> come<00:01:02.030> on<00:01:02.180> and<00:01:02.720> evolved

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:03.140 
designers come on and evolved

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:05.439 
designers come on and evolved
considerably<00:01:04.030> luke<00:01:05.030> wheels<00:01:05.239> have<00:01:05.420> been

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:05.449 
considerably luke wheels have been

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:07.660 
considerably luke wheels have been
developed<00:01:05.960> for<00:01:06.020> small<00:01:06.650> compact<00:01:07.040> bikes<00:01:07.340> they

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:07.670 
developed for small compact bikes they

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:10.060 
developed for small compact bikes they
allow<00:01:08.150> suspension<00:01:08.840> where<00:01:09.290> suspension<00:01:09.830> can't

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:10.070 
allow suspension where suspension can't

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:12.130 
allow suspension where suspension can't
normally<00:01:10.220> fit<00:01:10.640> they<00:01:11.360> like<00:01:11.570> to<00:01:11.690> go<00:01:11.810> over<00:01:11.840> bumps

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:12.140 
normally fit they like to go over bumps

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:13.750 
normally fit they like to go over bumps
easily<00:01:12.590> they're<00:01:12.800> low<00:01:12.950> maintenance<00:01:12.979> and

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:13.760 
easily they're low maintenance and

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.630 
easily they're low maintenance and
they're<00:01:14.750> fun<00:01:14.960> this<00:01:15.800> is<00:01:15.950> our<00:01:16.070> own<00:01:16.190> luke<00:01:16.400> wheels

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:16.640 
they're fun this is our own luke wheels

where we can load the wheels up with the

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.100 
where we can load the wheels up with the
force<00:01:49.550> of<00:01:49.729> the<00:01:49.820> rider<00:01:50.060> and<00:01:50.360> then<00:01:50.810> test<00:01:51.050> them

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:51.110 
force of the rider and then test them

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:52.930 
force of the rider and then test them
over<00:01:51.350> thousands<00:01:51.860> and<00:01:51.890> thousands<00:01:52.429> of<00:01:52.490> miles<00:01:52.670> to

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:52.940 
over thousands and thousands of miles to

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:54.940 
over thousands and thousands of miles to
make<00:01:53.090> sure<00:01:53.240> the<00:01:53.360> wheels<00:01:53.569> last<00:01:54.380> the<00:01:54.740> lifetime

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 
make sure the wheels last the lifetime

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.070 
make sure the wheels last the lifetime
of<00:01:55.190> the<00:01:55.369> bike<00:01:55.550> so<00:01:56.240> as<00:01:56.330> you<00:01:56.450> can<00:01:56.600> see<00:01:56.780> we've<00:01:56.929> put

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:57.080 
of the bike so as you can see we've put

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:58.660 
of the bike so as you can see we've put
a<00:01:57.110> lot<00:01:57.259> of<00:01:57.350> effort<00:01:57.619> and<00:01:57.860> resource<00:01:58.250> into<00:01:58.520> our

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:58.670 
a lot of effort and resource into our

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:00.669 
a lot of effort and resource into our
test<00:01:58.910> house<00:01:59.149> but<00:01:59.810> we<00:01:59.929> don't<00:02:00.140> have<00:02:00.289> the<00:02:00.440> funds

00:02:00.669 --> 00:02:00.679 
test house but we don't have the funds

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:02.800 
test house but we don't have the funds
to<00:02:00.830> take<00:02:01.220> this<00:02:01.340> to<00:02:01.610> do<00:02:01.729> the<00:02:01.850> tooling<00:02:02.270> required

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810 
to take this to do the tooling required

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:04.990 
to take this to do the tooling required
