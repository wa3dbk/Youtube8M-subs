00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
General Electric 1/3 horse let's see if

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.140 
General Electric 1/3 horse let's see if
we<00:00:27.810> can<00:00:28.070> tip<00:00:29.070> it<00:00:29.099> up<00:00:29.279> so<00:00:29.550> you<00:00:29.640> can<00:00:29.789> see<00:00:30.029> it

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
we can tip it up so you can see it

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:38.299 
we can tip it up so you can see it
better<00:00:35.930> it's<00:00:36.930> a<00:00:37.050> general<00:00:37.350> electric<00:00:37.680> 1/3<00:00:38.040> horse

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
better it's a general electric 1/3 horse

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:44.020 
better it's a general electric 1/3 horse
it's<00:00:38.760> just<00:00:38.969> a<00:00:39.059> single<00:00:39.420> speed<00:00:41.450> and<00:00:42.450> I<00:00:42.570> have<00:00:42.840> a

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:44.030 
it's just a single speed and I have a

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:46.340 
it's just a single speed and I have a
temporarily<00:00:45.030> just<00:00:45.300> have<00:00:45.600> a<00:00:45.629> thinner<00:00:45.960> drive

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
temporarily just have a thinner drive

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.350 
temporarily just have a thinner drive
belt<00:00:46.680> on<00:00:46.829> there<00:00:47.129> just<00:00:47.430> so<00:00:47.550> that<00:00:47.579> I<00:00:48.000> could

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
belt on there just so that I could

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.389 
belt on there just so that I could
attach<00:00:49.079> it<00:00:49.260> pretty<00:00:49.500> quickly<00:00:49.710> without<00:00:50.010> pulling

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
attach it pretty quickly without pulling

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.779 
attach it pretty quickly without pulling
the<00:00:50.610> whole<00:00:50.760> blade<00:00:50.969> assembly<00:00:51.420> off<00:00:52.610> and<00:00:53.610> it's

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
the whole blade assembly off and it's

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.990 
the whole blade assembly off and it's
not<00:00:54.530> fully<00:00:55.530> tight<00:00:55.920> because<00:00:56.460> I<00:00:56.640> didn't<00:00:56.879> want

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
not fully tight because I didn't want

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.819 
not fully tight because I didn't want
the<00:00:57.120> fan<00:00:57.329> running<00:00:57.629> at<00:00:57.750> full<00:00:57.960> rpm<00:00:58.440> in<00:00:58.559> the<00:00:58.649> house

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
the fan running at full rpm in the house

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.389 
the fan running at full rpm in the house
it's<00:00:59.160> it's<00:00:59.670> 30<00:01:00.420> inch<00:01:00.629> blades<00:01:00.960> and<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:02.129> actual

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
it's it's 30 inch blades and the actual

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.990 
it's it's 30 inch blades and the actual
panel<00:01:02.670> is<00:01:02.850> 36<00:01:03.390> inch<00:01:03.570> by<00:01:03.780> 36<00:01:04.290> inches<00:01:04.820> so<00:01:05.820> it's

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
panel is 36 inch by 36 inches so it's

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.719 
panel is 36 inch by 36 inches so it's
very<00:01:06.570> big<00:01:08.930> and<00:01:09.930> I<00:01:10.020> don't<00:01:10.080> I<00:01:10.470> never<00:01:11.040> knew<00:01:11.700> that

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
very big and I don't I never knew that

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.840 
very big and I don't I never knew that
Belko<00:01:12.330> made<00:01:12.600> attic<00:01:13.290> fans<00:01:13.590> but<00:01:14.100> I<00:01:14.159> thought<00:01:14.640> that

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
Belko made attic fans but I thought that

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.330 
Belko made attic fans but I thought that
part<00:01:15.090> was<00:01:15.150> pretty<00:01:15.299> cool<00:01:16.490> and<00:01:17.490> it<00:01:18.119> has<00:01:18.150> like<00:01:18.689> the

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.340 
part was pretty cool and it has like the

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.980 
part was pretty cool and it has like the
little<00:01:20.340> data<00:01:20.549> plaque<00:01:21.060> here<00:01:21.420> and<00:01:21.600> see<00:01:21.780> what<00:01:21.930> it

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
little data plaque here and see what it

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:32.929 
little data plaque here and see what it
says<00:01:26.720> fan<00:01:27.720> rpm<00:01:28.170> for<00:01:28.530> 7d<00:01:31.520> you<00:01:32.520> know<00:01:32.610> it<00:01:32.759> does

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
says fan rpm for 7d you know it does

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:38.090 
says fan rpm for 7d you know it does
give<00:01:33.119> the<00:01:33.240> belt<00:01:33.420> size<00:01:35.840> so<00:01:36.840> let's<00:01:37.470> see<00:01:37.650> 30<00:01:37.890> inch

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
give the belt size so let's see 30 inch

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:43.359 
give the belt size so let's see 30 inch
size<00:01:39.650> 8,000<00:01:40.650> cubic<00:01:40.829> feet<00:01:41.159> a<00:01:41.220> minute<00:01:41.310> CFM

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:43.369 
size 8,000 cubic feet a minute CFM

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:46.100 
size 8,000 cubic feet a minute CFM
that's<00:01:44.369> pretty<00:01:44.610> good<00:01:44.820> so<00:01:45.299> we'll<00:01:45.780> give<00:01:45.960> it<00:01:45.990> a

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
that's pretty good so we'll give it a

00:01:46.110 --> 00:02:03.050 
that's pretty good so we'll give it a
little<00:01:46.259> shot<00:01:46.560> here

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.940 

there's<00:02:03.660> a<00:02:03.690> lot<00:02:03.840> of<00:02:03.990> belt<00:02:04.350> slippage<00:02:04.800> because

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
there's a lot of belt slippage because

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.800 
there's a lot of belt slippage because
like<00:02:05.160> I<00:02:05.280> said<00:02:05.340> it's<00:02:05.670> pretty<00:02:05.880> it's<00:02:06.510> on<00:02:06.630> there

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
like I said it's pretty it's on there

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:23.390 
like I said it's pretty it's on there
pretty<00:02:06.960> loose

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.400 

you<00:02:23.760> can<00:02:23.940> see<00:02:24.209> how<00:02:24.510> the<00:02:24.569> blades<00:02:24.990> are<00:02:25.260> a<00:02:25.290> little

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
you can see how the blades are a little

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:33.590 
you can see how the blades are a little
bit<00:02:26.990> out<00:02:27.990> of<00:02:28.200> alignment<00:02:31.880> but<00:02:32.880> I<00:02:33.330> think<00:02:33.510> it

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
bit out of alignment but I think it

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.000 
bit out of alignment but I think it
could<00:02:33.690> be<00:02:33.840> remedied<00:02:34.050> pretty<00:02:34.650> easily<00:02:34.770> if<00:02:34.980> you

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
could be remedied pretty easily if you

00:02:35.010 --> 00:03:07.380 
could be remedied pretty easily if you
had<00:02:35.220> a<00:02:35.250> vise<00:02:35.550> grip

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:07.390 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:10.599 

thanks<00:03:08.390> for<00:03:08.510> watching
