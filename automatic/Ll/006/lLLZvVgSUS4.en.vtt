 more than half of the 10 million inhabitants 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:29.869
 indispensable 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:33.570
 deck standing 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.980
 of ivory 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:39.690
 with a graph 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.420
 the other pilots 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:43.330
 how to start in june 

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:47.670
 just before that show what packaging they came in here did not see the video 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.240
 to another destination 

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:52.060
 the next day 

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:53.970
 st 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:54.789
 the gun 

00:00:54.789 --> 00:00:58.190
 I'll decide what packaging in portugal miguel 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:00.860
 enthusiastic 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:03.860
 Yes Yes 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:07.930
 the blackberry making up your team kept 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.720
 on the same day however this material 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:13.900
 who uses the river subway 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:17.470
 the go-cart jugs they sent me too 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:19.600
 3 defeats 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.910
 a marquee of respect we may have sent to the century 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:27.170
 how does this network 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:29.490
 I begin to realize that here 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.500
 had to eat 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.570
 of slow matosinhos or is bland 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.350
 who here in the wood 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:39.300
 I really like this debate 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:41.070
 good first 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.190
 The whole team has five blades showing more closely to you 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:52.570
 just as they 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:54.280
 the wood planes 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.600
 being dark shut light dark-light 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.060
 classic wood burning are open being able to help 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:05.810
 the first layer of ivory from the second in CuiabÃ¡ the guide I do not know very well 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:07.760
 How do you pronounce 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:08.729
 the next 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.739
 to have more purpose 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.019
 the next 

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:13.369
 is inconsistent 

00:02:13.369 --> 00:02:16.089
 here comes a 

00:02:16.089 --> 00:02:17.129
 softly 

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:20.149
 already in the low part 

00:02:20.149 --> 00:02:22.989
 Good, we tried to transgress. 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:25.139
 and drilling 

00:02:25.139 --> 00:02:27.689
 It's your turn, Beijing, it's not good. 

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:28.790
 in the afternoon 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.470
 central they center the attacker had a bit of shadow showed that you 

00:02:34.329 --> 00:02:35.889
 we leave here 

00:02:35.889 --> 00:02:38.870
 piece of theater down here 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:41.529
 exceptionally so expressive that if Beijing 

00:02:41.529 --> 00:02:46.919
 so I've already talked to the owner of apimec-rio lukachenko at 

00:02:46.919 --> 00:02:48.549
 internet is the pain 

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:51.559
 they do the delights I spoke with them 

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:54.339
 and this is already a list 

00:02:54.339 --> 00:02:55.359
 nobody 

00:02:55.359 --> 00:02:57.139
 up here 

00:02:57.139 --> 00:03:00.139
 the inscription that is the Basque did not like the team 

00:03:00.889 --> 00:03:04.769
 They tell us that they will improve this together with improving our speaking skills. 

00:03:05.369 --> 00:03:06.650
 they will grow 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:08.849
 in its very fine furuto 

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:09.959
 the funds 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:11.989
 strange ne 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:14.379
 Why do you work out there and then give it up? 

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:16.079
 to head to the bottom of the net 

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:19.700
 why many spaces can not get on the other side of it 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:22.059
 This effort is very important. 

00:03:22.059 --> 00:03:25.339
 but look what was so well done until you can take a break and 

00:03:25.339 --> 00:03:26.269
 yards 

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:29.309
 the rest are pernambuco 

00:03:29.309 --> 00:03:31.909
 inflation just did not come back in time 

00:03:31.909 --> 00:03:35.069
 the place was taken by everyone police 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:38.069
 have to change little 

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:42.489
 dreaming 

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:44.029
 the gremistas 

00:03:44.029 --> 00:03:45.559
 even so 

00:03:45.559 --> 00:03:48.049
 a strong determination 

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:50.229
 intermediate in the table 

00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:53.229
 It's good, I really liked it, it's just right. 

00:03:55.619 --> 00:03:58.619
 he is one of the dreams of the Bertin patient 

00:03:59.719 --> 00:04:01.309
 probably a year 

00:04:01.309 --> 00:04:02.889
 think 

00:04:02.889 --> 00:04:05.119
 on vice 

00:04:05.119 --> 00:04:06.359
 10 

00:04:06.359 --> 00:04:09.359
 comparing with the same law 

00:04:10.009 --> 00:04:13.009
 he 35 clients 

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:16.900
 just in time 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:19.529
 port prince who had bertin and soon 

00:04:19.529 --> 00:04:22.759
 I do not carry the net more regularly than my 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:25.719
 in less than five 

00:04:25.719 --> 00:04:27.999
 a good clue I do not even know why 

00:04:27.999 --> 00:04:30.999
 He accepted it and it will be as before. 

00:04:31.819 --> 00:04:34.469
 full of 20 km from londrina 

00:04:34.469 --> 00:04:36.639
 this segment 

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:39.439
 in which chelsea has not been 

00:04:39.439 --> 00:04:41.889
 We will not go and see here. 

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:44.800
 That's the way I see it. 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:46.629
 this region of the deck 

00:04:46.629 --> 00:04:49.629
 we help better proceed 

00:04:52.059 --> 00:04:55.809
 this legion of the good they had if you work and settle down 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:00.059
 and that part of the middle of the world is so high 

00:05:00.059 --> 00:05:01.970
 now it would be 200 thousand 

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:03.689
 go elsewhere 

00:05:03.689 --> 00:05:08.699
 other side of ricky this part is not so sharp and just sleep more 

00:05:08.699 --> 00:05:11.729
 high interest that the only one does not bite 

00:05:11.729 --> 00:05:15.239
 my position is not a placement of the mangrove where 

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:17.639
 the peak of the dry season 

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:21.379
 Attila I also saw a cavity on the deck and pool 

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:25.099
 sextant giving you to see aquino 

00:05:25.099 --> 00:05:28.319
 and that's where we even alcoholic evening 

00:05:28.319 --> 00:05:30.479
 That's why I think it was 

00:05:30.479 --> 00:05:33.479
 last in the europe league 

00:05:34.449 --> 00:05:37.029
 gives a check and a sense of humor 

00:05:37.029 --> 00:05:38.270
 steering wheel then 

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:41.270
 a kind of cavity though with technique 

00:05:42.379 --> 00:05:43.540
 the funds 

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:46.669
 over a hundred thousand / looks like it's coming back here 

00:05:46.669 --> 00:05:49.389
 It's not only I know what I'm going to do. 

00:05:49.389 --> 00:05:52.289
 this time who had done that other 

00:05:52.289 --> 00:05:55.289
 but it is only on that day that it tends to undergo pressure 

00:05:56.069 --> 00:05:59.069
 our challenge for me 

00:06:00.619 --> 00:06:01.880
 and although here 

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:03.819
 half of them 

00:06:03.819 --> 00:06:06.629
 three circulate 2 centimeters 

00:06:06.629 --> 00:06:08.639
 noncompliance 

00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:13.399
 third goal two wide so I decided much more dynamic frames 

00:06:14.069 --> 00:06:17.400
 on account of this not comparing with the musician's name 

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:19.490
 I'm used to the team. 

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:22.490
 It's not very clear to me, it's complete. 

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:25.339
 so big cities 

00:06:25.339 --> 00:06:27.569
 click here 

00:06:27.569 --> 00:06:28.719
 in the document 

00:06:28.719 --> 00:06:31.719
 he maradona 

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:34.379
 know that here 

00:06:34.379 --> 00:06:37.379
 it has a 

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:41.550
 and does not go without a representative 

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:44.999
 only that same side bars for the other and 

00:06:44.999 --> 00:06:45.860
 such an attitude 

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:48.860
 the same 

00:06:50.119 --> 00:06:53.349
 and we tried to keep it a secret 

00:06:53.349 --> 00:06:54.289
 say what question 

00:06:54.289 --> 00:06:57.289
 Here we have a host of leaders 

00:07:00.529 --> 00:07:03.529
 neither court 

00:07:04.169 --> 00:07:06.389
 the cameras to kia 

00:07:06.389 --> 00:07:09.930
 we're not supposing it's kept below we're 

00:07:10.659 --> 00:07:12.029
 the Madeirans 

00:07:12.029 --> 00:07:14.449
 I do not know the perfection question 

00:07:14.449 --> 00:07:17.449
 so they ended up following the same line 

00:07:19.139 --> 00:07:21.219
 97 min 

00:07:21.219 --> 00:07:24.219
 cool 

00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:28.589
 this text that was the first video 

00:07:28.589 --> 00:07:30.379
 the first time 

00:07:30.379 --> 00:07:32.740
 in santa clara country deep 

00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:33.839
 what you 

00:07:33.839 --> 00:07:37.789
 two or three almost destitute because it is enough thing they do is sent 

00:07:41.099 --> 00:07:43.960
 within the party and tourism of the Senate itself 

00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:46.189
 session of the 20th 

00:07:46.189 --> 00:07:49.069
 apart from the rest you see 

00:07:49.069 --> 00:07:51.080
 so this everyone 

00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:52.490
 in all the state was worth
