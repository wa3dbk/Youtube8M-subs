00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:05.270
 I 

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:12.910
 breakdance happened the other way 

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:15.500
 music and embedded in a story 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:17.570
 together with the dance arts of the 12th 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:19.460
 are standing Dutchman box beer 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:23.570
 the success factors of the internet 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:26.119
 hits was filmed piece of short 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:27.890
 the short film Congo Julien at and 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:30.410
 Michael Hildebrand from Aachen 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:36.739
 it is her most successful part 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:37.670
 Of course clip the connection too 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:39.080
 that's probably why 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:40.940
 Work better with dancers 

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:43.430
 because then we understand more like that 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:47.659
 to feel and how to dance that 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:49.460
 could capture better at almost 

00:00:47.659 --> 00:00:51.830
 daily training can be great 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:52.820
 Films as the three students call themselves 

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:55.400
 to inspire 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:57.530
 they have the idea for the pisa shock 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:59.320
 when you join the dutch justin us 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:02.210
 a breakdance show 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:06.220
 by the success of the clips he is in 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:06.220
 his home became a star 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:10.310
 the great thing about it is the good feeling 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:11.929
 the stage 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:13.490
 There you can do whatever you want 

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:15.850
 Nobody ever said what you did 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:15.850
 should do 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.160
 The four-minute film is about the 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.780
 sad everyday life of a schoolboy and 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:26.350
 escaping with the help of the 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.350
 dancing 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.230
 the touching clip spreads 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.240
 raging on the internet within less 

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:47.690
 he will be more than a million times a day 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.690
 called 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:52.470
 partly as a bit cheesy and 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.450
 inventions in any case 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.830
 We also like to operate in part 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.080
 The comedy area may not be 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:00.479
 so bad I think it is at such 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:02.670
 a former topic but yes we are 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:09.119
 Surprise that anyway so well over 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:10.140
 not all films came out like that 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.970
 emotionally 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.730
 mostly they are a mix of dance 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.440
 asian martial arts and comedy 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.970
 elements 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.680
 often the three students play themselves 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.570
 the leading roles and a half years ago 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.540
 they started filmmaking 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:27.180
 with a small budget and much help from 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.890
 friends and family 's craft 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:32.190
 have the beginning to the middle 20 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:34.110
 year old self taught the dance 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:36.720
 itself is already something 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:39.209
 because you can already really mega 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:42.630
 unfold and enjoy its creativity 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:45.000
 let it run and the film still to that 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:49.310
 Here you can also whole worlds 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:51.720
 created from the idea to the 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:54.330
 special effects everything makes the trio 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.950
 Sometimes it takes several months 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:03:00.440
 until a movie is finished 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:00.440
 the focus is always on dancing 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:10.300
 nearly four and a half million times 

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:12.490
 the clips of super films so far 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:15.600
 clicked a total of six short 

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:15.600
 stories have turned them 

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:33.160
 they have not had money for it yet 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:39.210
 but get tons of fanmail 1000 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:39.210
 pictures kilometer long letters biscuits so 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:44.260
 such writing motivates the three 

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:45.880
 Aachener to continue in her 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:49.830
 hometown go in search of 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:49.830
 shooting locations for your new project 

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:58.430
 They want another clip with them 

00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:00.830
 justin we talk to the breakdancer 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:03.260
 her first hit movie that comes for 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:10.460
 test shots especially from new mountains in 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:12.170
 the proximity of venlo always arrived 

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:14.030
 accompanied by his mother, he travels 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:17.620
 twelve-year-old now appear 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:17.620
 in the us and asia 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:24.100
 I think about the future I want 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:24.100
 just be myself and just dance 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:30.190
 juba films like the popularity the 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:32.290
 gift of the twelve year old use around the 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:34.620
 The success of piece of torque was still too 

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:34.620
 beat 

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:41.290
 So much experimented area 

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:42.760
 free and for me as a non-dancer 

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:44.530
 and little filmmaker is that 

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:45.820
 Of course, very very enjoyable that one 

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:47.170
 so very secretive there very much now 

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:48.250
 and then maybe 

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:50.190
 You can not offer something like that yet 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:52.200
 seen 

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:53.940
 the students wish for someday 

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:55.680
 to earn money with your work 

00:04:53.940 --> 00:05:00.350
 for that they fall further to theirs 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:00.350
 film career dance step for dance step
