00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:02.719
 the goat 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:10.590
 the dogs prove again and again that 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:13.190
 today they are enough to get a good 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.190
 hanger 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:22.289
 and I want portals 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:29.630
 so there are priests 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:33.160
 look to the east 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:33.160
 before a rebound 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:43.359
 on this day for the young redfish 

00:00:41.019 --> 00:00:45.850
 it seems safer to navigate between 

00:00:43.359 --> 00:00:48.609
 stubble to find shelter in the 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:52.829
 channels between the incipient reed that 

00:00:48.609 --> 00:00:52.829
 they easily get around dogs 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:01:00.489
 well sometimes it does not exist it's actually 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.489
 the safe place 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:14.440
 it's barely dawn and the hanger has 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.440
 begins to be considerable 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:26.980
 the setter tom sniffs something again but 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.980
 also this time he keeps the piece 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.460
 pressure say 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:44.460
 the fountain 

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:54.940
 I told Carlos he's already 7 while 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:54.940
 the dogs do not stop working 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:07.540
 this one is going the hunter has not taken advantage 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:09.520
 one of the few cocks of water that 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:12.690
 So far they have managed to avoid 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.690
 mouth of dogs
