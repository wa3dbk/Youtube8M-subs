looks<00:00:15.570> like<00:00:15.719> in<00:00:15.929> a<00:00:15.990> controlled<00:00:16.440> environment

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
looks like in a controlled environment

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:18.680 
looks like in a controlled environment
like<00:00:17.190> my<00:00:17.340> office<00:00:17.789> and<00:00:18.029> one<00:00:18.300> thing<00:00:18.449> to<00:00:18.570> note

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
like my office and one thing to note

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.390 
like my office and one thing to note
about<00:00:18.720> the<00:00:18.990> galaxy<00:00:19.230> s5<00:00:19.619> is<00:00:19.890> that<00:00:20.160> when<00:00:20.279> you're

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
about the galaxy s5 is that when you're

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.580 
about the galaxy s5 is that when you're
recording<00:00:20.699> in<00:00:20.939> 4k<00:00:21.150> you<00:00:21.840> don't<00:00:22.020> have<00:00:22.140> access<00:00:22.439> to

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
recording in 4k you don't have access to

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.679 
recording in 4k you don't have access to
optical<00:00:22.980> image<00:00:23.279> stabilization<00:00:23.699> and<00:00:24.210> while

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
optical image stabilization and while

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.120 
optical image stabilization and while
optical<00:00:25.050> image<00:00:25.260> stabilization<00:00:25.560> is<00:00:25.949> it

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
optical image stabilization is it

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.370 
optical image stabilization is it
basically<00:00:26.310> keeps<00:00:26.730> this<00:00:26.910> video<00:00:27.420> steady<00:00:27.840> when

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
basically keeps this video steady when

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:29.900 
basically keeps this video steady when
you're<00:00:28.529> moving<00:00:28.710> around<00:00:28.949> so<00:00:29.460> you<00:00:29.519> won't<00:00:29.820> get

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
you're moving around so you won't get

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.330 
you're moving around so you won't get
that<00:00:30.060> jittery<00:00:30.539> shaky<00:00:31.080> kind<00:00:31.320> of<00:00:31.439> look<00:00:31.650> but

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
that jittery shaky kind of look but

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.970 
that jittery shaky kind of look but
there's<00:00:32.520> none<00:00:32.730> of<00:00:32.759> that<00:00:32.880> on<00:00:33.149> 4k<00:00:33.510> so<00:00:34.380> a<00:00:34.649> lot<00:00:34.860> of

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
there's none of that on 4k so a lot of

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.530 
there's none of that on 4k so a lot of
these<00:00:35.100> shots<00:00:35.399> and<00:00:35.670> test<00:00:35.940> shots<00:00:36.210> that<00:00:36.420> I've

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
these shots and test shots that I've

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.020 
these shots and test shots that I've
done<00:00:36.750> I<00:00:36.960> actually<00:00:37.230> use<00:00:37.649> a<00:00:37.680> tripod<00:00:38.250> and<00:00:38.489> some<00:00:38.940> of

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
done I actually use a tripod and some of

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.700 
done I actually use a tripod and some of
them<00:00:39.149> I<00:00:39.239> use<00:00:39.450> tenpel<00:00:40.020> so<00:00:40.230> you'll<00:00:40.379> be<00:00:40.500> able<00:00:40.559> to

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
them I use tenpel so you'll be able to

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.440 
them I use tenpel so you'll be able to
see<00:00:40.860> the<00:00:40.980> differences<00:00:41.430> there<00:00:41.730> but<00:00:42.149> enough<00:00:42.390> of

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
see the differences there but enough of

00:00:42.450 --> 00:04:08.660 
see the differences there but enough of
my<00:00:42.570> blabbering<00:00:42.989> let's<00:00:43.350> not<00:00:43.530> waste<00:00:43.680> any<00:00:43.829> time

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:08.670 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:11.790 

and<00:04:09.670> there<00:04:10.060> you<00:04:10.180> have<00:04:10.210> a<00:04:10.390> guy<00:04:10.630> some<00:04:10.930> 4k<00:04:11.350> sample

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:11.800 
and there you have a guy some 4k sample

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:14.250 
and there you have a guy some 4k sample
shots<00:04:11.980> of<00:04:12.130> the<00:04:12.220> galaxy<00:04:12.640> s5<00:04:13.000> it<00:04:13.810> looks<00:04:14.080> to<00:04:14.230> me

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:14.260 
shots of the galaxy s5 it looks to me

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.380 
shots of the galaxy s5 it looks to me
like<00:04:14.410> it<00:04:14.710> performs<00:04:15.190> best<00:04:15.520> outdoors<00:04:16.120> during

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:16.390 
like it performs best outdoors during

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:18.870 
like it performs best outdoors during
the<00:04:16.630> day<00:04:16.840> recording<00:04:17.739> situations<00:04:18.280> outside<00:04:18.489> of
