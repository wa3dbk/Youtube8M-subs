00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.490 
going to this area lobe and down over
here<00:01:28.970> you<00:01:29.150> have<00:01:29.420> the<00:01:29.720> secondary<00:01:30.110> bronchus

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:30.500 
here you have the secondary bronchus

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.130 
here you have the secondary bronchus

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:33.140 
going to the inferior lobe of the left

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.630 
going to the inferior lobe of the left
lung<00:01:33.320> there<00:01:34.310> are<00:01:34.700> ten<00:01:35.590> bronchopulmonary

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:36.640 
lung there are ten bronchopulmonary

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.720 
lung there are ten bronchopulmonary
segments<00:01:37.640> in<00:01:37.790> each<00:01:38.540> lung<00:01:39.230> although<00:01:40.130> in<00:01:40.460> the

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:40.730 
segments in each lung although in the

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:43.210 
segments in each lung although in the
left<00:01:41.030> lung<00:01:41.660> very<00:01:42.590> often<00:01:43.040> these

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:43.220 
left lung very often these

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:45.880 
left lung very often these
bronchopulmonary<00:01:44.050> segments<00:01:45.050> will<00:01:45.140> fuse<00:01:45.560> so

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:45.890 
bronchopulmonary segments will fuse so

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:47.280 
bronchopulmonary segments will fuse so
that<00:01:45.920> you<00:01:46.190> can<00:01:46.340> get<00:01:46.520> as<00:01:46.640> few<00:01:46.880> as<00:01:46.909> eight

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:47.290 
that you can get as few as eight

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:50.290 
that you can get as few as eight
bronchopulmonary<00:01:48.290> segments<00:01:49.130> on<00:01:49.340> the<00:01:49.700> left

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:50.300 
bronchopulmonary segments on the left

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:55.140 
bronchopulmonary segments on the left
side<00:01:50.870> and<00:01:51.200> so<00:01:52.270> the<00:01:53.300> Branko<00:01:54.080> a<00:01:54.290> pulmonary

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:55.150 
side and so the Branko a pulmonary

00:01:55.150 --> 00:02:00.399 
side and so the Branko a pulmonary
segments<00:01:56.150> are<00:01:56.290> supplied<00:01:57.290> by<00:01:58.240> bronchi<00:01:59.409> which

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:00.409 
segments are supplied by bronchi which

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:03.670 
segments are supplied by bronchi which
are<00:02:00.560> now<00:02:00.650> tertiary<00:02:01.400> bronchi<00:02:01.760> and<00:02:02.409> on<00:02:03.409> this

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:03.680 
are now tertiary bronchi and on this

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.840 
are now tertiary bronchi and on this
model<00:02:04.420> the<00:02:05.420> tertiary<00:02:05.990> bronchi<00:02:06.650> are<00:02:07.280> easy<00:02:07.610> to

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:07.850 
model the tertiary bronchi are easy to

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:09.790 
model the tertiary bronchi are easy to
see<00:02:08.090> this<00:02:08.539> is<00:02:08.750> also<00:02:08.929> known<00:02:09.170> as<00:02:09.349> segmental

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800 
see this is also known as segmental

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.119 
see this is also known as segmental
bronchi<00:02:10.009> or<00:02:10.399> easy<00:02:10.639> to<00:02:10.789> see<00:02:11.260> because<00:02:12.260> they<00:02:12.980> are

00:02:13.119 --> 00:02:13.129 
bronchi or easy to see because they are

00:02:13.129 --> 00:02:15.450 
bronchi or easy to see because they are
colored<00:02:13.519> so<00:02:14.510> right<00:02:14.689> over<00:02:14.719> here<00:02:14.959> you<00:02:15.230> can

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:15.460 
colored so right over here you can

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:19.170 
colored so right over here you can
see<00:02:15.640> again<00:02:17.190> you<00:02:18.190> can<00:02:18.370> see<00:02:18.490> up<00:02:18.640> here<00:02:18.670> this<00:02:19.120> is

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
see again you can see up here this is

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.960 
see again you can see up here this is
where<00:02:19.300> you<00:02:19.510> have<00:02:19.690> the<00:02:19.930> primary<00:02:20.410> bronchus<00:02:20.970> then

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
where you have the primary bronchus then

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.600 
where you have the primary bronchus then
you<00:02:22.120> have<00:02:22.390> the<00:02:23.020> secondary<00:02:23.470> bronchus<00:02:24.010> going<00:02:24.430> to

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
you have the secondary bronchus going to

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:26.610 
you have the secondary bronchus going to
the<00:02:24.790> superior<00:02:25.150> lobe<00:02:25.300> over<00:02:25.570> here<00:02:25.840> and<00:02:25.990> then<00:02:26.500> you

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
the superior lobe over here and then you

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.760 
the superior lobe over here and then you
can<00:02:26.800> see<00:02:27.010> that<00:02:27.040> these<00:02:27.670> bronchi<00:02:28.480> are<00:02:28.770> colored

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:29.770 
can see that these bronchi are colored

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:32.730 
can see that these bronchi are colored
and<00:02:30.060> these<00:02:31.060> would<00:02:31.330> represent<00:02:31.360> each<00:02:32.320> color

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:32.740 
and these would represent each color

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:35.430 
and these would represent each color
represents<00:02:32.890> a<00:02:33.400> segment<00:02:33.850> so<00:02:34.690> these<00:02:34.930> represent

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 
represents a segment so these represent

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.150 
represents a segment so these represent
the<00:02:36.100> tertiary<00:02:37.030> or<00:02:37.630> the<00:02:37.750> segmental<00:02:38.110> bronchi<00:02:38.770> so

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
the tertiary or the segmental bronchi so
