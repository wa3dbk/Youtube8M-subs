00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:09.210
 good, what I have done is that 

00:00:05.089 --> 00:00:14.160
 if not to the form and time for me 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:16.260
 I understand what the players that 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.869
 important clubs in the country that 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.880
 Interested Uruguayan players put 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.609
 that they have done things well and that is 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.279
 very normal that is not strange in our 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:28.609
 country that happens all over the world but if 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:31.470
 you have to have a little moderation and and 

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:35.010
 understand what it is that is being 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:38.129
 playing the last matches and later 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:41.670
 to all that because there will be time for 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:43.649
 to talk to negotiate for 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:48.000
 reach an agreement and that all 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:50.370
 more pablo parts as has been rumored 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.539
 player has even sent messages to 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.320
 you telling him that if you want 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.320
 go give him the opportunity 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.710
 expresses his desire to have this 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:02.520
 opportunity I did tell you that I did not 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:06.000
 necessarily because the development 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:09.690
 professional and personal 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.870
 it will not be guaranteed to be in a 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:14.520
 team of the great ones of the country and 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:17.070
 the uruguay well also has a 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.710
 important platform to grow a 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:22.380
 international platform that we are 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:27.720
 arming to to give the promotion to 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:31.170
 the talents but good some 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:33.090
 member of the 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:37.130
 in the sports league the violence of 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:41.340
 be fought spaced things and the then 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:45.159
 obviously in his youth 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:47.020
 He has not been able to drive, he does not believe it 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:48.340
 you that is the opportunity to be 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:50.440
 is giving here in the bronx and it's very 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:53.260
 good or can not wait to have 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:55.619
 best opportunities is a very good 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.619
 opportunity 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:03.439
 the army is history because it is 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:04.909
 strong and it 's great now we all know 

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:09.289
 what sport says of the ailment 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:12.769
 for for costa rica but but the 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:16.130
 Uruguayan has a good base a good 

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:19.130
 platform to move forward has already been 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:21.260
 demonstrated during this year and if this 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:24.190
 year this first year itself what we did 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:26.480
 in the first category is 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:27.470
 undoubtedly the second year has to 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:31.519
 be better 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:33.799
 I have been in this for a long time 

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:36.920
 had a lot of experience in soccer 

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:41.980
 international book understands youth 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:45.980
 one understands the eagerness of many players 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:49.819
 and nothing else is just sitting down 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:52.040
 talk talk to sit down and talk to him 

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:54.769
 wait for a while to finish this 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:57.680
 championship and if it is the case of the bow with 

00:02:54.769 --> 00:03:00.079
 with alajuelense sports league but what 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:03.650
 important here what is important here is 

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:08.290
 keep calm and we like as 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:11.239
 leaders you can be the example and 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:13.280
 Let everyone know what good 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:17.689
 that we have the capacity to sit down and 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:20.329
 negotiate and I am the best option for the 

00:03:17.689 --> 00:03:24.590
 player to go for the two clubs 

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:26.959
 I think that many of us have focused on 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:29.719
 the country to train more the 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:32.180
 coaches so that the players are 

00:03:29.719 --> 00:03:34.449
 professionals and have a better football 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:38.260
 but we have paid very little attention 

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:40.819
 to the behavior of the leadership 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:43.310
 behavior off the court and 

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:45.579
 final that makes football better 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:45.579
 as well
