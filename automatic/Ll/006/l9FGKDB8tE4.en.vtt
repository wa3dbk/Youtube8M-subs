it was so I did SQL in an email last
night

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
night

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.240 
night
I'm<00:00:48.660> reaching<00:00:48.870> for<00:00:49.170> the<00:00:49.230> products<00:00:49.649> I<00:00:49.829> asked

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250

her<00:00:50.309> in<00:00:50.399> an<00:00:50.489> email<00:00:50.640> last<00:00:51.000> night<00:00:51.149> what<00:00:51.449> the

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
her in an email last night what the

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.130

product<00:00:51.930> was<00:00:52.020> and<00:00:52.680> I<00:00:53.219> think<00:00:53.430> she<00:00:54.180> probably<00:00:54.210> was

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
product was and I think she probably was

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.959 
product was and I think she probably was
busy<00:00:55.440> because<00:00:55.710> she<00:00:55.890> usually<00:00:56.309> would've

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969
