00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:03.569
 ah 

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:12.120
 all right 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:18.880
 do not 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:30.560
 good everything here your great esteem with 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:32.800
 our first video tutorial on the 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:35.050
 link of legends 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.879
 since the video tutorial will not be a 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:38.890
 simple gameplay but it will explain 

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:41.379
 what is done to play this 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:44.030
 video game basically do it going to 

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:46.400
 to do is buy me a dollar ring 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:48.660
 when applying and then what is that 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.740
 everyone who has four attacks 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:54.540
 basic 

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:56.460
 wr we have them here and two additional or 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:58.830
 advantages as you like 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.690
 efe is also king kyle or 

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:03.750
 restoration that is this here that is the 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:06.990
 go and the passive that every person that 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:10.560
 has a morgana that is this 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:14.510
 particular character inflicts 10% of 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.510
 additional spell suction 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:19.510
 well the game basically deals in 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:23.340
 destroy the enemy turrets that we see 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:23.340
 here and destroy the nests 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:30.299
 I'm the two enemy turrets and the 

00:01:27.929 --> 00:01:31.979
 base is in mode 5 against 5 after 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:34.140
 I also uploaded another video in 3 against 3 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.479
 explaining the same 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:40.290
 well or it would be a new page 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:42.150
 fallera that will help us a lot at the time 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.940
 of choosing an object what attacks do not 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:47.190
 we have to improve at every moment 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:50.760
 according to the page tells us that level 1 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:52.680
 we do not improve the first attack 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:54.120
 and the worst thing that we have to buy is 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.300
 the golden ring that is what I have 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:56.300
 bought 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.490
 good with the ground but it's good 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:03.850
 in the mode of 5 against 5 really go 2 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:03.850
 above 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:11.300
 in this case and 2 below or instead of going 2 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:13.910
 down I would go 1 down and a jungle that 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:17.330
 basically is dedicated to going up the slope 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:20.959
 kike this case killing some beings that 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:23.310
 they give you additional generation damage 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:25.140
 mana generation lives 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:28.170
 and by what time can you get out of this 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:31.290
 board here from the river say that ar and 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:34.069
 kill you whiten is to appear as 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.069
 I said right now 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:39.209
 and surprising and without realizing it has already 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:39.209
 killed basically 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:46.400
 everything against the solar with the medium is 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.400
 now that pretty good 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:52.270
 It is that they are the subjects sounds are 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:53.810
 these little kids here with 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:56.270
 digging 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:58.880
 those players are not online the 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:00.680
 players whatever they are are the computer 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:03.220
 they are basically useless only 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.220
 we will be 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:13.180
 and to our good the blood leaving 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:17.250
 they look like 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:17.250
 Players 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:34.870
 when and that basically all the 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:38.670
 senses for this game already 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:38.670
 if it was basically a 20 and normal 9 

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:48.920
 sometimes when I'm attacking two 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:51.020
 people to the same player and killed him 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:54.170
 one of them simplified fruits angers 

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:58.010
 what you write you fall in hospital 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:04:00.170
 what does the style mean the stolen style 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:03.370
 so he stole his death 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:03.370
 that's what he thinks 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:09.070
 does not mean it is bad then it is 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.070
 best 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:21.090
 There are many times when once ss 

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:23.050
 when an enemy game if it changes from 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:26.860
 Street 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:28.300
 and it also says cj higher when you've 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:31.480
 killed someone in a simple way 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:37.050
 and fast because I did it well 

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:37.050
 at level 4 then better third too 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:46.680
 fuck I almost do the study good is 

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:48.930
 pirate that got truncated when they say the 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:50.700
 second morgana is a puddle that 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:53.040
 can on the ground and that removes damage 

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:56.169
 for a while my intention is a 

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:59.330
 shield that right now 

00:04:56.169 --> 00:05:01.900
 and we also very bad 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:01.900
 for him 

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:23.980
 the millions as I said before are 

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:26.380
 three others 

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:27.340
 these three domes a diamond the zinc or 

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:29.650
 something like that 

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:32.919
 that it is very important to destroy the 

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:36.930
 less one can access the base if not 

00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:40.129
 we can not destroy the important base 

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:42.679
 and if we go into 

00:05:40.129 --> 00:05:46.279
 this what I know as the house so 

00:05:42.679 --> 00:05:48.860
 say enemy that this ray can not 

00:05:46.279 --> 00:05:52.149
 kill in five seconds so 2018 so 

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:52.149
 that we can not go there 

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:59.470
 this basically everything I have to 

00:05:57.289 --> 00:06:03.430
 explain about this game 

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:06.950
 so if you want to keep seeing the 

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:09.020
 video click here up 

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:12.460
 and keep watching it and complete but already 

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:12.460
 normal without any application
