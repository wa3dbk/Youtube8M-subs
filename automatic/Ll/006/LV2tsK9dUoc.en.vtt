00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
to do is press the shutter button

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.590 
to do is press the shutter button
halfway<00:01:16.430> to<00:01:17.430> see<00:01:17.610> what<00:01:17.759> the<00:01:17.880> camera<00:01:18.090> selects

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
halfway to see what the camera selects

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.530 
halfway to see what the camera selects
as<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:19.110> proper<00:01:19.380> aperture<00:01:19.890> in<00:01:20.700> my<00:01:21.060> case<00:01:21.299> that's

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
as the proper aperture in my case that's

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.499 
as the proper aperture in my case that's
f<00:01:21.689> 1.8<00:01:22.259> it's<00:01:23.100> also<00:01:23.280> in<00:01:23.549> white<00:01:23.790> instead<00:01:24.180> of<00:01:24.299> red

f 1.8 it's also in white instead of red

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.420 
f 1.8 it's also in white instead of red
