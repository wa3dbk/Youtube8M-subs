00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:08.440
 I do not know what the doc and we are in other 

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:08.440
 tracks 

00:00:10.179 --> 00:00:16.430
 we are in this video because I am very 

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:18.039
 fool to study them as air this 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:19.990
 third channel 

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:22.950
 because it's going to be a little different than 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:24.330
 us or that I hope 

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:27.390
 the issue is that in this case what 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.280
 I want to upload videogame games in 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.890
 majority although it does not have to but 

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:34.320
 well that the main channel of 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.780
 secondary do not stick anything like 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.730
 example you create license plate or since you walk 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.380
 you'll have pictures somewhere not 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.290
 I know I do not know how you have done but tennis 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:46.140
 images for now I have recorded crash 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.800
 bandicoot of the first 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.960
 the first day with baxter 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:53.450
 and christina racing all recorded also 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.579
 but well I'm starting now 

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:56.690
 record mirror's edge we had a 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:58.940
 series a long time ago I wanted 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:01.130
 re -record the will have your own 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:02.840
 partridge and not simply 

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:05.120
 and tell you in this channel is going to be a 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:06.980
 little bit more of relaxation is to say if worse 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:10.490
 that someday I can not upload video here 

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:11.840
 it does not go up, nothing happens but I'm 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:14.600
 trying to have recorded seats of 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:17.210
 beforehand so that we always have 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:19.100
 possible we have videos by another 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:22.280
 side I would like to upload console games 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:25.490
 with manning or for example that I have for 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:30.350
 there the littlebigplanet 2 or the 3 the 4 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:33.110
 also more little games yes good too 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:36.140
 I had thought to go up maybe because I did not 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:38.810
 I know some console minecraft with a 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:41.930
 malibÃº you have that is complicated because 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:44.030
 now when I have free her 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:45.710
 she is busy when he already has something 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.509
 free I'm busy in difficult end 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:49.700
 you see it in the second one that is 

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:51.440
 complicated but good when we can 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.880
 I suppose if we upload it some 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:55.880
 little thing together 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:58.630
 and what else is apart from these I would like 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.630
 record for example 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:05.149
 ay 3d dot game heros this start a lot 

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:07.909
 illusion in his moment of peace that the 

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:10.900
 there would be every principal about like two or 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:13.790
 three videos and he did not like it 

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:16.510
 so that's why there were them in this in the 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:19.250
 channel and you're 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:22.160
 I have another one out there that I will not record or 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:23.269
 not that it's the network dead redemption I do not know 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:27.950
 if there will be, it's worth it because it's a very 

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:31.180
 long then I do not know I'll try that yes 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:33.769
 I would like to upload and the software and 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:36.620
 I want to upload many things from 

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:38.690
 he left the sun to anyway be done 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:41.390
 a pc game that I feel like uploading it 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:43.910
 I will upload also as long as they are not 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:46.910
 games that I'm not going to upload here brands of 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:49.819
 pc for example but still can see pc 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:51.450
 that I do not like much or something I can upload it 

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:54.090
 here 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.560
 and that is the purpose of this channel to 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:03:00.180
 see if from tomorrow the videos 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:01.920

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:06.890

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.550

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:14.310
 try to go up every day at 4 if 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:16.290
 it's possible and as I say I 'm not going to 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:17.660
 take like the other channels if one day 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:20.730
 there is no video because there is no video 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:23.280
 simply this is more to climb what 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:25.319
 that I've always liked up no 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:27.690
 I've always wanted to climb but that 

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:28.799
 People do not like too much as the 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:30.000
 they raise this third channel that makes me 

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:31.920
 a lot of hope
