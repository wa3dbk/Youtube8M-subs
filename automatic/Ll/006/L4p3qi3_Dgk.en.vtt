00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
you just a grow all of them and then you

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.439 
you just a grow all of them and then you
run<00:00:43.949> right<00:00:44.280> around<00:00:44.399> a<00:00:44.640> corner<00:00:44.910> to<00:00:45.120> ball<00:00:45.270> them

00:00:45.439 --> 00:00:45.449 
run right around a corner to ball them

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:47.510 
run right around a corner to ball them
up<00:00:45.539> because<00:00:45.809> pretty<00:00:46.710> much<00:00:46.800> all<00:00:47.070> of<00:00:47.190> them<00:00:47.340> are

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
up because pretty much all of them are

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.040 
up because pretty much all of them are
mainly<00:00:47.730> range<00:00:48.059> except<00:00:48.420> the<00:00:48.570> scouts<00:00:48.840> are

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
mainly range except the scouts are

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.529 
mainly range except the scouts are
arranged<00:00:49.500> so<00:00:50.190> to<00:00:50.250> get<00:00:50.370> this<00:00:50.489> couch<00:00:50.910> right<00:00:51.210> next

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
arranged so to get this couch right next

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:52.610 
arranged so to get this couch right next
gee<00:00:51.719> that's<00:00:51.930> why<00:00:52.079> you<00:00:52.170> have<00:00:52.289> to<00:00:52.379> run<00:00:52.530> around

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
gee that's why you have to run around

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.549 
gee that's why you have to run around
the<00:00:52.800> corner<00:00:53.480> so<00:00:54.480> that<00:00:54.510> you<00:00:55.050> know<00:00:55.140> their<00:00:55.320> v<00:00:55.440> is

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
the corner so that you know their v is

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.959 
the corner so that you know their v is
not<00:00:55.710> obstructed<00:00:56.219> so<00:00:56.340> they<00:00:56.460> can<00:00:56.609> hit<00:00:56.730> you<00:00:58.969> get

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
not obstructed so they can hit you get

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.849 
not obstructed so they can hit you get
my<00:01:00.180> reward<00:01:00.329> and<00:01:00.870> then<00:01:01.109> standing<00:01:01.620> in<00:01:01.769> the

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
my reward and then standing in the

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.369 
my reward and then standing in the
capture<00:01:02.070> circle<00:01:02.750> and<00:01:03.750> to<00:01:03.840> speed<00:01:04.050> this<00:01:04.199> up

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
capture circle and to speed this up

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:05.930 
capture circle and to speed this up
because<00:01:04.530> no<00:01:04.769> one<00:01:04.890> wants<00:01:05.129> to<00:01:05.250> watch<00:01:05.369> I<00:01:05.670> think<00:01:05.850> it

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:05.940 
because no one wants to watch I think it

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:07.310 
because no one wants to watch I think it
takes<00:01:05.970> about<00:01:06.360> 20<00:01:06.690> seconds<00:01:06.990> I<00:01:07.050> didn't<00:01:07.229> actually

long-range steel which may I kind of

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.500 
long-range steel which may I kind of
like<00:02:16.830> it's<00:02:17.160> not<00:02:17.310> like<00:02:17.459> extremely<00:02:17.849> bored<00:02:18.209> but

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
it does speed it up so she do get there

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.790 
it does speed it up so she do get there
quicker<00:02:23.700> and<00:02:24.540> I<00:02:24.660> mean<00:02:24.840> it<00:02:25.200> can<00:02:25.380> help<00:02:25.530> you<00:02:25.650> get

just<00:02:36.480> happened<00:02:37.020> to<00:02:37.080> be<00:02:37.200> trying<00:02:37.410> to<00:02:37.440> pick<00:02:37.590> up

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
just happened to be trying to pick up

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.350 
just happened to be trying to pick up
supply<00:02:37.980> and<00:02:38.130> notice<00:02:38.400> you<00:02:38.580> they<00:02:39.090> can't

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
supply and notice you they can't

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:40.940 
supply and notice you they can't
actually<00:02:39.540> look<00:02:39.959> at<00:02:40.080> the<00:02:40.170> contested<00:02:40.650> swords

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
actually look at the contested swords

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:42.770 
actually look at the contested swords
and<00:02:41.100> repel<00:02:41.340> it<00:02:41.459> in<00:02:41.550> time<00:02:41.760> because<00:02:42.090> it<00:02:42.300> just

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
and repel it in time because it just

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.540 
and repel it in time because it just
takes<00:02:43.020> on<00:02:43.200> the<00:02:43.290> supply<00:02:43.590> camp<00:02:43.860> too<00:02:44.040> quick<00:02:44.310> it

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
takes on the supply camp too quick it

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:47.000 
takes on the supply camp too quick it
takes<00:02:44.760> 30<00:02:45.090> seconds<00:02:45.540> for<00:02:46.170> it<00:02:46.230> to<00:02:46.260> be<00:02:46.410> contested

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
takes 30 seconds for it to be contested

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:48.920 
takes 30 seconds for it to be contested
and<00:02:47.130> only<00:02:47.580> 35<00:02:47.970> seconds<00:02:48.300> for<00:02:48.420> us<00:02:48.480> to<00:02:48.600> kill<00:02:48.780> them

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
and only 35 seconds for us to kill them

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.940 
and only 35 seconds for us to kill them
so<00:02:49.140> so<00:02:49.650> we're<00:02:49.770> only<00:02:49.980> up<00:02:50.130> like<00:02:50.940> five<00:02:51.209> seconds

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
so so we're only up like five seconds

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:54.320 
so so we're only up like five seconds
before<00:02:52.950> they<00:02:53.310> get<00:02:53.430> all<00:02:53.580> get<00:02:53.790> killed<00:02:53.819> and<00:02:54.209> then

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
before they get all get killed and then

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:55.400 
before they get all get killed and then
by<00:02:54.450> then<00:02:54.600> I'm<00:02:54.720> already<00:02:54.900> in<00:02:55.020> the<00:02:55.080> capture

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
by then I'm already in the capture

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.520 
by then I'm already in the capture
circle<00:02:55.440> so<00:02:55.830> anyway<00:02:56.660> you<00:02:57.660> can<00:02:57.810> see<00:02:57.959> I<00:02:57.989> believe<00:02:58.200> I

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
circle so anyway you can see I believe I

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:01.970 
circle so anyway you can see I believe I
pre<00:02:58.800> casted<00:02:59.310> a<00:02:59.810> shadow<00:03:00.810> return<00:03:01.170> there<00:03:01.380> that's

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
pre casted a shadow return there that's

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:03.170 
pre casted a shadow return there that's
something<00:03:02.220> you<00:03:02.280> can<00:03:02.459> do<00:03:02.550> if<00:03:02.700> it's<00:03:02.850> tough<00:03:03.060> to

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
something you can do if it's tough to

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:04.940 
something you can do if it's tough to
get<00:03:03.269> around<00:03:03.450> the<00:03:03.570> corner<00:03:03.780> you<00:03:04.440> don't<00:03:04.590> have<00:03:04.739> to

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
get around the corner you don't have to

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:06.920 
get around the corner you don't have to
and<00:03:05.400> then<00:03:05.790> just<00:03:05.910> go<00:03:06.060> ad<00:03:06.209> with<00:03:06.390> them<00:03:06.510> and<00:03:06.750> then

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
and then just go ad with them and then

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:10.400 
and then just go ad with them and then
return<00:03:07.590> to<00:03:07.620> your<00:03:07.920> spot<00:03:08.250> and<00:03:08.480> then<00:03:09.480> run<00:03:10.230> right

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
return to your spot and then run right

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:12.470 
return to your spot and then run right
around<00:03:10.530> the<00:03:10.709> corner<00:03:11.300> basically<00:03:12.300> how<00:03:12.450> I

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
around the corner basically how I

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.270 
around the corner basically how I
started<00:03:13.050> off<00:03:13.230> I<00:03:13.260> don't<00:03:13.620> have<00:03:13.739> a<00:03:13.769> perfect

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
started off I don't have a perfect

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.130 
started off I don't have a perfect
algorithm<00:03:14.850> yet<00:03:15.000> but<00:03:15.209> i<00:03:15.239> like<00:03:15.510> to<00:03:15.690> use<00:03:15.750> skill

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
algorithm yet but i like to use skill

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:20.000 
algorithm yet but i like to use skill
five<00:03:16.519> then<00:03:17.519> skill<00:03:17.970> three<00:03:18.390> and<00:03:19.319> then<00:03:19.470> you<00:03:19.650> skill

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
five then skill three and then you skill

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.190 
five then skill three and then you skill
five<00:03:20.280> again<00:03:20.640> and<00:03:20.910> then<00:03:21.090> skill<00:03:21.420> three<00:03:21.780> once<00:03:22.019> or

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
five again and then skill three once or

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.020 
five again and then skill three once or
twice<00:03:22.290> and<00:03:22.650> then<00:03:22.709> i<00:03:22.890> use<00:03:23.040> my<00:03:23.220> elite<00:03:23.459> skill<00:03:23.790> you

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
twice and then i use my elite skill you

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:26.570 
twice and then i use my elite skill you
want<00:03:24.180> to<00:03:24.269> use<00:03:24.360> dagger<00:03:24.630> storm<00:03:24.989> early<00:03:25.580> that's

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:26.580 
want to use dagger storm early that's

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:27.800 
want to use dagger storm early that's
because<00:03:26.760> you<00:03:26.850> want<00:03:27.030> to<00:03:27.090> kill<00:03:27.209> the<00:03:27.269> scouts<00:03:27.540> they

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
because you want to kill the scouts they

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:30.229 
because you want to kill the scouts they
blind<00:03:28.170> you<00:03:28.380> and<00:03:28.700> you<00:03:29.700> don't<00:03:29.790> want<00:03:30.030> to<00:03:30.090> be

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239 
blind you and you don't want to be

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:31.430 
blind you and you don't want to be
getting<00:03:30.450> blinded<00:03:30.900> it's<00:03:31.049> going<00:03:31.200> to<00:03:31.260> slow<00:03:31.380> you

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
getting blinded it's going to slow you

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.800 
getting blinded it's going to slow you
down<00:03:31.470> a<00:03:31.590> lot<00:03:31.799> so<00:03:32.130> skill<00:03:32.610> early<00:03:33.150> skill<00:03:33.480> is<00:03:33.660> very

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
down a lot so skill early skill is very

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:35.180 
down a lot so skill early skill is very
important<00:03:34.110> for<00:03:34.170> taking<00:03:34.410> out<00:03:34.530> scouts<00:03:34.860> quick

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
important for taking out scouts quick

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:37.900 
important for taking out scouts quick
and<00:03:35.430> that<00:03:36.269> as<00:03:36.420> a<00:03:36.450> large<00:03:36.870> impact<00:03:37.230> on<00:03:37.470> how<00:03:37.620> quick

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:37.910 
and that as a large impact on how quick

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:42.560
