00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.920
 on stove wanted that commenting I bring 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.940
 another review of the gun model and we see 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.560
 this time with a weapon that has 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.539
 converted if it's not in my favorite is 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.549
 one of my favorites and good what 

00:00:09.539 --> 00:00:14.219
 you have a background by the way is the cause 

00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:16.289
 in the title that I am in many in 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.150
 this one being in the background was fierce in the 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.560
 first round plus a fierce super 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.660
 fast or just start the game 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.880
 two minutes passed and I already took the 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.380
 hair was an authentic past is that 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.669
 you already have a handsome job with this gun 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.439
 but is that sincerely call as 

00:00:26.669 --> 00:00:30.210
 you are with her one you had already in the 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.490
 episode I think it was three mentality 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.520
 locklear or obvious fierce mentality of 

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:37.140
 cot as you want to call it you and 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:38.520
 Well, this one will save it to upload 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.770
 apart because I think it's a fierce 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.750
 spectacular all the time surrounding and not 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.250
 I know I loved it, so, well, the 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.870
 second part of employment was something is 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.070
 more short and my hair comes because I do not 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.050
 wants to talk not much to talk about 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.580
 this piece of gun not then we're going to 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.720
 go with the good as you are 

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:52.710
 seeing then a point of cadence wins 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:54.600
 simply and lose a point of 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.950
 accuracy is good but let's go with what 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.020
 that they import real statistics from 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:00.000
 weapon and that point of cadence does 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.580
 very much the truth you are already seeing 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.519
 Well, normal faces practically 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:06.300
 they are all like the normal channel 35 30 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.880
 bullets 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:11.820
 normal 41 expanded then we have recharge 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:14.190
 pretty fast from 14 to 12 sec and we do 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.720
 fast and 2 with 3 we leave you empty like this 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:17.010
 that it is best not to leave empty here 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.200
 because I was a little bit more recharged 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:21.120
 as always the recoil although it loses 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.470
 precision honestly I do not put a 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:24.210
 treadmill because it's still very low 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.550
 that is, if it is the maximum, it is customary to use the 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.170
 h bra accustomed to being the vall me 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:29.400
 it seems that this cause does not move 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.630
 absolutely nothing like the 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.060
 normal is practically lost from 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.220
 religion does not do anything and here we have 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.540
 important 850 7 bullets per minute of 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.740
 normal lacquer cadence has 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.820
 seven hundred that in account with which 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:43.380
 has 107 more bullets per minute is a 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.210
 enough gives that point of cadence that wins 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.410
 so that's why this weapon is 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.820
 so good that it annihilates them 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:49.230
 completely not or is it a weapon 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.180
 I have terrific hot that kills 

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:52.710
 super fast and good can be reach 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.480
 that it has is 10 meters with two that 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.850
 they are the most important because the 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:58.470
 first damages are equal up to 40 with 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.790
 6 meters ie up to 40 with 6 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:01.020
 while killing four bullets and starting 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.220
 from there five with which is a weapon 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.110
 that they are almost always late 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:05.760
 four bullets distracted very far and with 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.350
 the pressure that you have then did not matter 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:09.630
 not naval and it's no more and then 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.580
 we have a damage because the truth 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:13.230
 quite low not because it's here but 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.280
 How good, then, with the other one he has with 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.870
 the cadence stone that has in this 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.000
 case that is the cadence of the vall by 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.140
 true, it is an authentic cheto because 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.520
 nothing moves absolutely me 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.440
 love this weapon lara second of my 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.480
 favorites so you already have from this 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.620
 besides andric many of you use it 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.580
 because I tell you to use it publicly 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.680
 and table as experts with her 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.810
 almost unintentionally and is a weapon 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.950
 Well that does not gradually has 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.300
 gone taking affection and has become 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.430
 one of my favorites have been every time 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:36.660
 so I hope you liked this one 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.190
 example and kids liked for not 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:40.380
 let me like it and not consume it but 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:44.930
 when I can sit and leave as I 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:44.930
 I liked favorites and if there will be more goodbye 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:01.909
 yes 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.909
 do not
