hope<00:00:31.669> I<00:00:31.970> ride<00:00:32.450> through<00:00:32.480> there<00:00:32.750> every<00:00:33.200> day<00:00:33.230> and

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:33.560 
hope I ride through there every day and

cutting down traffic congestion and air

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:37.870 
cutting down traffic congestion and air
pollution<00:00:35.600> would<00:00:36.020> be<00:00:36.230> great<00:00:36.710> and<00:00:37.309> that<00:00:37.670> used

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:37.880 
pollution would be great and that used

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:40.000 
pollution would be great and that used
to<00:00:37.970> be<00:00:38.149> one<00:00:38.420> beautiful<00:00:39.110> street<00:00:39.380> could<00:00:39.830> be

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:40.010 
to be one beautiful street could be

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:42.500 
again the electric trolley bus project

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.350 
again the electric trolley bus project
would<00:00:42.650> really<00:00:43.010> help<00:00:43.250> to<00:00:43.340> clean<00:00:43.700> it<00:00:43.820> up<00:00:43.940> there

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:44.360 
would really help to clean it up there

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:47.170 
would really help to clean it up there
non-polluting<00:00:45.290> speedier<00:00:45.920> the<00:00:46.400> ride<00:00:46.670> smoother

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:47.180

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:49.540 
and even the air conditioning is better
