00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:19.859
 friends farmers friends farmer hello 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.000
 welcome to the farm welcome to 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.740
 cocotte tv today I present to you 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.410
 a mouse of a brand that we know 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:28.260
 then all genius for once here lÃ© 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.090
 rebadged gx gaming then genuis why 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.679
 I said known to all since this is the 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.899
 mark that you come across and that I cross 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.000
 regularly going to do new 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:39.540
 small food shopping in large 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.770
 surface and ming very honestly on 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.149
 the moment we were pretty skeptical 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.280
 this is our first test of a product of 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.840
 genius and as you've noticed 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.309
 I spoke to the imperfect Thursday were 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.850
 because it's pretty good 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.940
 surprise 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:53.039
 the mouse really has good arguments to 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.840
 argue and not least but I 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.809
 will resume that after at the level of the 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.340
 presentation we find something 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.920
 fairly classic in imitation 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.510
 metallic mouse on bright background 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.799
 gx gaming a little in every way the 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.189
 scorpion that will be found 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.760
 all over 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:10.790
 gina of her little name flip box with 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:14.070
 explanations on the interior 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:15.299
 the explanations on the back you the 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.670
 notice she already had a ward knot 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:21.000
 a competitor site and a small 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.500
 presentation of the app on the side at 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.180
 bundle level there is still a 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.610
 good surprise as bundle is enough 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.080
 therefore a user guide a 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.720
 second guide to the 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:35.450
 mouse connection a drivers cd 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:37.860
 containing the drivers and a new ones 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:40.799
 the user manual look for my 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:43.500
 words a box badged scorpion gx 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:47.520
 gaming container if I can open it 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:49.140
 of course yes yes of course he 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.729
 had to press below and above 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.040
 the weighing mascots so if 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.450
 weights 5 grams each 30 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.850
 more grams it's important for 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.340
 after I will explain why the 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.350
 set additional skate therefore 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.979
 the time when the bundle will be rifi as 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.899
 heartbreak 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:05.790
 it's really welcome from 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:07.829
 jean paul surin jx gaming must 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.420
 I stop calling it genius 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:12.000
 propose a bundle relatively 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.150
 consequent what she also has a 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.920
 interesting aspect 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:17.260
 it's the price I'll come back after 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.810
 above the mouse itself well you 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:21.730
 see it offers a pretty charged look 1 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:22.989
 it is quite marked in particular by the 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.250
 presence of the big night who knew in 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:26.620
 back so each some some 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:28.090
 will appreciate others less a little bit 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.769
 least my case anyway in all 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:31.810
 case at the level of the finish is nothing 

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:33.730
 to say it's pretty well done the 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:36.340
 adjustments are accurate the turn antics 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:38.680
 just as much on the subject matter we have 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:40.870
 a kind of save touch on the top 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:43.359
 a metallic aspect in aspect coating 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:45.579
 metallized on the red parts of 

00:02:43.359 --> 00:02:48.340
 rubbers on the side parts 

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:49.840
 anti-slip rubber of small edging 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:51.010
 translucent that let the 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.980
 light as you see since I 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:55.870
 the trendy in the front we will find 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:57.370
 the same thing so a well finished product 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:00.730
 the proof is in you look at the 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:02.620
 sleeve that hosts the jaws cable 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:03.970
 braided and pretty well damn it's 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.709
 really not bad done anyway y'a 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:08.049
 nothing to say at that level so she has 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:09.370
 at least for her this aspect of 

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:11.769
 finish the constructions quite 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:14.829
 right there you smile itself well 

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:17.650
 see it while stopping time and that's 

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:20.109
 so a fairly compact mouse a 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.750
 rather slight curvature on the hull 

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:24.609
 back then we find the famous 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:26.199
 scorpions the gx translucent gaming which 

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:28.599
 blink going back will find 

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:31.269
 two buttons one button for profiles 

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:33.400
 in front of a knob two parts of 

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:35.769
 rubber with a central part in 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:37.389
 plexi that lights up just as much so the 

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:40.299
 scroll and well he has nothing to say 

00:03:37.389 --> 00:03:42.340
 cramps relatively well mark enough 

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:43.659
 fresh in scrolling but it's 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:46.060
 really not unpleasant and the 

00:03:43.659 --> 00:03:48.459
 of use and nothing to say the cliques 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:49.900
 on each side for its purposes as you the 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:53.019
 notice at the level of my fingers it's 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:55.090
 rather content in terms of size two 

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:57.220
 buttons in addition to the clicks on each 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:04:00.370
 side a small marking program steen 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:04.239
 a window that will allow to visualize 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:07.090
 the dpi on the right the pavement of 

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:09.159
 anti-slip rubber on the left a 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:10.959
 paved with new buttons I show 

00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:12.790
 and on the front so both parties 

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:14.650
 translucent a bit the image of lighthouses in 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:16.630
 below we will find the skates 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:19.510
 normal you can change them in case 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:22.300
 of wear the sensor and proof that the 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:25.460
 finla gila to an excellent finish 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:29.509
 that's what this little attraction 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:31.610
 quite i would say unusual but 

00:04:29.509 --> 00:04:34.130
 quite welcome the hatch is mounted 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:36.380
 on an axis with a spring part so 

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:37.940
 and you have inside a part 

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:40.940
 rubber to accommodate the masses 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:42.380
 lot the whole clip really well 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:43.789
 damn there is nothing to say it adds 

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:47.900
 maybe a little bit of weight because 

00:04:43.789 --> 00:04:49.280
 that's the immediate consequence 145 g 

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:50.870
 it's quite heavy for a fury so 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:52.520
 as I tell you with 30 g more 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:53.300
 is at 175 grams it's starting to make a 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:55.190
 little mastodon 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:56.870
 so you see it I said content 

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:58.789
 an art is taken to the level in 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:00.229
 hand I already did the test so I 

00:04:58.789 --> 00:05:02.240
 can you talk about it quickly 

00:05:00.229 --> 00:05:03.470
 no particular concern except 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:03.979
 that it is clearly not for 

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:05.750
 the palm 

00:05:03.979 --> 00:05:07.190
 it can hardly be a little bit 

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:09.349
 find its place for the ring finger where 

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:10.759
 the index according to how 

00:05:09.349 --> 00:05:12.889
 you hold the mouse because she is 

00:05:10.759 --> 00:05:14.120
 fine enough finally but it's not 

00:05:12.889 --> 00:05:16.490
 worse than a co goes because if you 

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:19.520
 look good we have a bit the same as 

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:20.870
 co goes so here you say it from above 

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:22.569
 level of technical characteristics 

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:25.880
 it's a rather modern mouse 

00:05:22.569 --> 00:05:28.099
 since it has a 2068 sensor 

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:29.509
 1200 dpi by name that collects 30 g 

00:05:28.099 --> 00:05:32.060
 of acceleration she has a memory chip 

00:05:29.509 --> 00:05:32.870
 of 32 kg the ebit buttons are 

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:35.930
 programmable 

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:37.460
 she has six profiles I do not know if 

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:39.650
 she has home run I'm going to throw a 

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:43.060
 eye away but I'm not sure I 

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:45.080
 do not believe no I do not see 

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:48.259
 of indication with respect to neurons 

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:51.110
 the cherry on cake small rgb 

00:05:48.259 --> 00:05:52.759
 you see it's blinking very sweet then 

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:53.960
 there it is rather stuck on the verse t 

00:05:52.759 --> 00:05:55.880
 he 'll show you a little bit 

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:59.120
 I will also very quickly 

00:05:55.880 --> 00:06:01.389
 light for you to appreciate the 

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:03.800
 retro lighting that's kind of nice 

00:06:01.389 --> 00:06:05.800
 so the jelly put on a glass glass 

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:09.590
 of water my inverse bermuda 

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:12.080
 so something nice and good 

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:14.750
 new is that all this is worth 59 

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:16.580
 90 euros so that's the place right now 

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:18.289
 rather in the interesting products 

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:20.690
 because the price quality ratio is 

00:06:18.289 --> 00:06:23.060
 clearly his advantage so he 

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:24.440
 was the agila of gx gaming on 

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:26.240
 coconut full on call tv 

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:27.500
 I invite you to read the test 

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:29.599
 written even though I gave you a lot 

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:31.310
 information about this video that 

00:06:29.599 --> 00:06:33.320
 will appear very soon in the 

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:34.849
 series following this video and I you 

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:38.020
 wish as usual a very very 

00:06:34.849 --> 00:06:38.020
 good day and I say goodbye
