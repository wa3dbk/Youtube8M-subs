suddenly<00:00:23.250> a<00:00:23.460> little<00:00:23.670> bit<00:00:23.760> more<00:00:23.880> flat<00:00:24.150> on<00:00:24.330> the

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
suddenly a little bit more flat on the

suddenly a little bit more flat on the
other<00:00:24.599> side<00:00:24.840> but<00:00:25.050> you'll<00:00:25.380> generally<00:00:25.590> have<00:00:25.800> a

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
other side but you'll generally have a

other side but you'll generally have a
flat<00:00:26.130> edge<00:00:26.310> here<00:00:26.580> and<00:00:26.699> what<00:00:27.240> that<00:00:27.449> does<00:00:27.630> is<00:00:27.660> it

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
flat edge here and what that does is it

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.109 
flat edge here and what that does is it
gets<00:00:28.050> just<00:00:28.289> so<00:00:28.410> that<00:00:28.560> your<00:00:28.679> thumbs<00:00:29.070> are<00:00:29.400> on

this particular part of the grip and now
that<00:00:32.790> will<00:00:32.970> do<00:00:33.150> will<00:00:33.690> actually<00:00:34.020> get<00:00:34.200> this<00:00:34.680> palm

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
that will do will actually get this palm

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.460 
that will do will actually get this palm
facing<00:00:35.700> the<00:00:35.790> target<00:00:36.000> and<00:00:36.300> this<00:00:36.780> palm<00:00:36.990> facing

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
away from the target so this is a

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:39.980 
away from the target so this is a
traditional<00:00:38.850> grip<00:00:39.240> right<00:00:39.420> here<00:00:39.480> you<00:00:39.750> can<00:00:39.870> see

00:01:12.499 --> 00:01:12.509 
target what this group is really

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:14.690 
target what this group is really
designed<00:01:12.659> to<00:01:12.899> do<00:01:13.109> is<00:01:13.320> actually<00:01:13.859> keep<00:01:14.250> a<00:01:14.460> player

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
designed to do is actually keep a player

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.639 
designed to do is actually keep a player
from<00:01:14.969> breaking<00:01:15.750> his<00:01:15.869> wrist<00:01:16.049> because<00:01:16.289> this<00:01:16.560> is

00:01:16.639 --> 00:01:16.649 
from breaking his wrist because this is

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:17.840 
from breaking his wrist because this is
going<00:01:16.770> to<00:01:16.829> be<00:01:16.890> a<00:01:16.920> lot<00:01:17.070> harder<00:01:17.250> breaking<00:01:17.759> the

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
going to be a lot harder breaking the

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.880 
going to be a lot harder breaking the
wrist<00:01:18.090> and<00:01:18.329> in<00:01:18.659> golf<00:01:18.869> we<00:01:19.020> wouldn't<00:01:19.289> have<00:01:19.649> all

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
wrist and in golf we wouldn't have all

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.069 
wrist and in golf we wouldn't have all
of<00:01:20.039> this<00:01:20.159> one<00:01:20.759> piece<00:01:20.999> in<00:01:21.030> one<00:01:21.329> motion<00:01:21.539> so

00:01:22.069 --> 00:01:22.079 
of this one piece in one motion so

00:01:22.079 --> 00:01:24.649 
of this one piece in one motion so
crossing<00:01:22.380> a<00:01:22.590> grip<00:01:22.740> basically<00:01:23.280> keeps<00:01:24.119> a<00:01:24.299> player

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
crossing a grip basically keeps a player

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.749 
crossing a grip basically keeps a player
from<00:01:24.990> breaking<00:01:25.710> his<00:01:25.859> wrist<00:01:26.070> like<00:01:26.310> this<00:01:26.369> means

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
from breaking his wrist like this means

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.669 
from breaking his wrist like this means
pretty<00:01:26.969> hard<00:01:27.210> on<00:01:27.299> us<00:01:27.539> to<00:01:27.689> do<00:01:27.810> it<00:01:27.899> right<00:01:27.990> now<00:01:28.170> but

00:01:28.669 --> 00:01:28.679 
pretty hard on us to do it right now but

00:01:28.679 --> 00:01:29.779 
pretty hard on us to do it right now but
again<00:01:28.770> that<00:01:29.100> will<00:01:29.159> keep<00:01:29.310> a<00:01:29.399> little<00:01:29.520> bit<00:01:29.670> more

00:01:29.779 --> 00:01:29.789 
again that will keep a little bit more

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:31.370 
again that will keep a little bit more
solid<00:01:30.119> that's<00:01:30.270> pretty<00:01:30.600> much<00:01:30.780> the<00:01:30.840> only<00:01:30.990> reason

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
solid that's pretty much the only reason

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.260 
solid that's pretty much the only reason
someone<00:01:31.560> would<00:01:31.649> use<00:01:31.950> that<00:01:31.979> grip<00:01:32.340> and<00:01:32.640> again

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
someone would use that grip and again

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.819 
someone would use that grip and again
it's<00:01:33.420> not<00:01:33.569> something<00:01:34.020> you'd<00:01:34.170> go<00:01:34.409> to<00:01:34.469> and<00:01:34.770> you

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
it's not something you'd go to and you

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.520 
it's not something you'd go to and you
teach<00:01:35.009> you<00:01:35.369> really<00:01:35.640> find<00:01:36.240> this<00:01:36.420> based<00:01:36.929> on<00:01:37.140> one

is it actually you have your right hand

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.550 
is it actually you have your right hand
separated<00:01:57.270> from<00:01:57.420> your<00:01:57.569> left<00:01:57.780> again<00:01:58.109> this<00:01:58.259> palm

right<00:01:58.709> here<00:01:58.979> will<00:01:59.429> be<00:01:59.579> for<00:01:59.999> the<00:02:00.270> back<00:02:00.600> of<00:02:00.719> his

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
right here will be for the back of his

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.719 
right here will be for the back of his
hand<00:02:00.929> will<00:02:01.139> be<00:02:01.259> facing<00:02:01.499> the<00:02:01.740> target<00:02:01.950> and<00:02:02.280> this

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
hand will be facing the target and this

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.129 
hand will be facing the target and this
hand<00:02:02.939> right<00:02:02.999> here<00:02:03.209> basically<00:02:03.509> is<00:02:03.689> leading<00:02:04.049> the

00:02:04.129 --> 00:02:04.139 
hand right here basically is leading the

00:02:04.139 --> 00:02:06.669 
hand right here basically is leading the
putter<00:02:04.350> one<00:02:04.709> of<00:02:04.829> the<00:02:04.920> things<00:02:05.189> that<00:02:05.340> makes<00:02:05.969> this

00:02:06.669 --> 00:02:06.679 
putter one of the things that makes this

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:09.350 
putter one of the things that makes this
grip<00:02:07.679> unique<00:02:08.039> is<00:02:08.280> because<00:02:08.970> you<00:02:09.060> have<00:02:09.090> your

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
grip unique is because you have your

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.150 
grip unique is because you have your
hands<00:02:09.630> separated<00:02:09.810> and<00:02:10.560> it's<00:02:10.740> a<00:02:10.800> little<00:02:10.920> bit

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
hands separated and it's a little bit

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.920 
hands separated and it's a little bit
different<00:02:11.550> but<00:02:11.700> it<00:02:11.820> also<00:02:12.000> keeps<00:02:12.480> the<00:02:12.660> player

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
different but it also keeps the player

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:14.780 
different but it also keeps the player
from<00:02:13.290> breaking<00:02:14.160> his<00:02:14.280> wrist

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
from breaking his wrist

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.490 
from breaking his wrist
I<00:02:14.909> would<00:02:15.420> say<00:02:15.599> that<00:02:15.629> this<00:02:15.870> putt<00:02:16.110> this<00:02:16.290> putting

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
I would say that this putt this putting

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.309 
I would say that this putt this putting
group<00:02:16.709> right<00:02:16.920> here<00:02:16.950> is<00:02:17.250> really<00:02:18.030> it<00:02:18.750> evolved

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 
group right here is really it evolved

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:21.740 
group right here is really it evolved
from<00:02:19.500> what<00:02:20.010> we<00:02:20.099> call<00:02:20.250> the<00:02:20.370> yips<00:02:20.640> of<00:02:21.000> someone

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
from what we call the yips of someone

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.929 
from what we call the yips of someone
having<00:02:21.870> uncontrollable<00:02:22.739> muscle<00:02:23.280> spasms<00:02:23.879> and

00:02:23.929 --> 00:02:23.939 
having uncontrollable muscle spasms and

00:02:23.939 --> 00:02:25.670 
having uncontrollable muscle spasms and
not<00:02:24.390> being<00:02:24.540> able<00:02:24.659> to<00:02:24.810> control<00:02:24.959> their<00:02:25.290> distance

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
not being able to control their distance

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.289 
not being able to control their distance
again<00:02:26.280> this<00:02:26.430> will<00:02:26.579> actually<00:02:26.760> make<00:02:26.969> the<00:02:27.120> player

00:02:27.289 --> 00:02:27.299 
again this will actually make the player

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:28.459 
again this will actually make the player
having<00:02:27.510> a<00:02:27.629> little<00:02:27.810> bit<00:02:27.900> smoother<00:02:28.260> if<00:02:28.409> you

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:28.469 
having a little bit smoother if you

00:02:28.469 --> 00:02:30.170 
having a little bit smoother if you
haven't<00:02:28.920> tried<00:02:29.010> this<00:02:29.250> it's<00:02:29.670> just<00:02:29.939> a<00:02:30.030> little

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
haven't tried this it's just a little

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:31.309 
haven't tried this it's just a little
bit<00:02:30.390> different<00:02:30.719> it's<00:02:30.930> a<00:02:31.019> little<00:02:31.200> less

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:31.319 
bit different it's a little less

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:33.860 
bit different it's a little less
conventional<00:02:31.620> and<00:02:32.099> it<00:02:32.400> will<00:02:32.519> be<00:02:32.780> takes<00:02:33.780> a

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
conventional and it will be takes a

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.210 
conventional and it will be takes a
little<00:02:33.989> bit<00:02:34.109> of<00:02:34.200> time<00:02:34.319> to<00:02:34.470> get<00:02:34.590> used<00:02:34.799> to<00:02:34.950> it<00:02:35.099> a

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
little bit of time to get used to it a

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:36.800 
little bit of time to get used to it a
lot<00:02:35.489> of<00:02:35.579> trust<00:02:35.790> in<00:02:35.970> this<00:02:36.030> grip<00:02:36.239> but<00:02:36.420> a<00:02:36.569> lot<00:02:36.780> of
