00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:47.770
 after eating full, he quietly cleaned up 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:50.520
 from the house stretched out on a big meadow under 

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:53.410
 tree and began to fall asleep 

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:54.989
 soon after the old goat returned 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:59.290
 from the forest home 

00:03:54.989 --> 00:04:00.150
 oh what did she see there the door was open 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:04.330
 wide open 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:07.330
 bench chairs tipped over troughs of wood chips 

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:10.690
 broken blankets and pillows scattered 

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:13.750
 became on and sky my many children where 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:17.470
 I couldn’t find them 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:19.389
 name but no one finally responded 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:22.599
 when she got to younger 

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:23.499
 a small voice shouted to her dear 

00:04:22.599 --> 00:04:26.889
 mother 

00:04:23.499 --> 00:04:30.039
 I got stuck in an hour case she immediately 

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:33.610
 freed my children from there and heard 

00:04:30.039 --> 00:04:36.909
 the story of how the wolf came and ate 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:39.370
 all the other kids you can imagine 

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:40.919
 imagine how she mourned her 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:45.249
 poor grandpas 

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:48.249
 finally the old goat of great sorrow 

00:04:45.249 --> 00:04:50.129
 went out of the house and younger goatling 

00:04:48.249 --> 00:04:53.620
 ran after her 

00:04:50.129 --> 00:04:57.909
 a little they went to the bow to the hall 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:05:01.529
 Seen that the wolf will stretch the whole tree and so 

00:04:57.909 --> 00:05:05.050
 snoring is unlikely to sway over him 

00:05:01.529 --> 00:05:08.110
 the goat went around and examined him from all 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:12.159
 parties and saw that in his bloated 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:15.339
 Bruce moves something oh god 

00:05:12.159 --> 00:05:18.490
 she wondered if it was my poor 

00:05:15.339 --> 00:05:21.819
 kids he had dinner with them and they are visible 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:24.189
 zhirehonki then she sent 

00:05:21.819 --> 00:05:27.729
 goat kid home for scissors 

00:05:24.189 --> 00:05:29.020
 a needle and thread then she climbed 

00:05:27.729 --> 00:05:32.800
 monster womb 

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:36.219
 and just a little goat cut off 

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:39.339
 already stuck out my head and how it became 

00:05:36.219 --> 00:05:42.039
 cut on, then all six kids 

00:05:39.339 --> 00:05:45.339
 you jumped one by one from the wolfish 

00:05:42.039 --> 00:05:48.550
 belly and all were zhiviekhonki and tselohonki 

00:05:45.339 --> 00:05:49.620
 because the monster swallowed them from hunger 

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:53.680
 wholly 

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:58.889
 that was the joy and they began to caress 

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:58.889
 to my mother and dance around her
