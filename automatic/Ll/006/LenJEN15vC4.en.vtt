and in the next few minutes we're going
to<00:00:03.510> learn<00:00:03.600> how<00:00:03.659> to<00:00:03.899> add<00:00:04.319> a<00:00:04.350> post<00:00:04.770> crop<00:00:05.130> vignette

to learn how to add a post crop vignette
to<00:00:05.879> our<00:00:06.000> image<00:00:06.299> as<00:00:06.450> well<00:00:07.020> as<00:00:07.290> a<00:00:07.319> little<00:00:07.620> bit<00:00:07.740> of

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
to our image as well as a little bit of

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.250 
to our image as well as a little bit of
grain<00:00:08.160> in<00:00:08.490> order<00:00:08.790> to<00:00:09.030> give<00:00:09.480> us<00:00:09.599> more<00:00:09.840> of<00:00:09.870> a

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
grain in order to give us more of a

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.640 
grain in order to give us more of a
vintage<00:00:10.740> look<00:00:11.000> so<00:00:12.000> under<00:00:12.389> the<00:00:12.509> effects<00:00:12.990> area<00:00:13.440> i

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
vintage look so under the effects area i

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.129 
vintage look so under the effects area i
have<00:00:14.009> access<00:00:14.280> to<00:00:14.519> both<00:00:15.089> the<00:00:15.450> post<00:00:15.900> crop

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
have access to both the post crop

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.439 
have access to both the post crop
vignetting<00:00:16.350> as<00:00:16.770> well<00:00:17.190> as<00:00:17.430> the<00:00:17.699> grain<00:00:17.940> option

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
vignetting as well as the grain option

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.510 
vignetting as well as the grain option
as<00:00:18.630> far<00:00:19.199> as<00:00:19.470> the<00:00:19.590> vignetting<00:00:19.920> goes<00:00:20.189> we<00:00:20.400> have

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
as far as the vignetting goes we have

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.519 
as far as the vignetting goes we have
three<00:00:20.789> different<00:00:21.000> styles<00:00:21.689> the<00:00:22.109> highlight

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
three different styles the highlight

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.160 
three different styles the highlight
priority<00:00:23.189> will<00:00:23.730> actually<00:00:24.150> put<00:00:24.359> the<00:00:24.449> priority

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
priority will actually put the priority

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.189 
priority will actually put the priority
on<00:00:25.320> the<00:00:25.769> highlights<00:00:26.519> around<00:00:27.180> the<00:00:27.720> edges<00:00:28.170> of

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
on the highlights around the edges of

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:29.900 
on the highlights around the edges of
your<00:00:28.529> images<00:00:28.980> when<00:00:29.160> you<00:00:29.220> add<00:00:29.369> the<00:00:29.550> vignette

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
your images when you add the vignette

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.089 
your images when you add the vignette
and<00:00:30.119> what<00:00:30.869> that<00:00:31.050> means<00:00:31.320> is<00:00:31.590> it's<00:00:31.830> going<00:00:32.009> to

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
and what that means is it's going to

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.459 
and what that means is it's going to
actually<00:00:32.250> try<00:00:32.550> to<00:00:32.579> recover<00:00:33.090> those<00:00:33.899> highlights

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
actually try to recover those highlights

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.160 
actually try to recover those highlights
but<00:00:34.829> if<00:00:35.219> it<00:00:35.790> recovers<00:00:36.390> the<00:00:36.510> highlights<00:00:36.930> it

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
but if it recovers the highlights it

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.470 
but if it recovers the highlights it
also<00:00:37.739> might<00:00:38.160> give<00:00:38.340> you<00:00:38.489> a<00:00:38.520> little<00:00:39.059> bit<00:00:39.239> of<00:00:39.270> a

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
also might give you a little bit of a

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.959 
also might give you a little bit of a
color<00:00:39.780> shift<00:00:39.899> so<00:00:40.649> we<00:00:40.770> have<00:00:40.920> a<00:00:40.950> second<00:00:41.430> style<00:00:41.730> as

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
color shift so we have a second style as

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.299 
color shift so we have a second style as
well<00:00:42.149> which<00:00:42.480> is<00:00:42.510> the<00:00:42.870> color<00:00:43.140> priority<00:00:43.710> here

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
well which is the color priority here

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:45.709 
well which is the color priority here
we're<00:00:44.489> not<00:00:44.610> going<00:00:44.760> to<00:00:44.820> use<00:00:44.879> the<00:00:45.270> highlight

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
we're not going to use the highlight

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.990 
we're not going to use the highlight
recovery<00:00:46.350> but<00:00:46.860> we<00:00:47.160> will<00:00:47.430> make<00:00:47.640> sure<00:00:47.700> that

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
recovery but we will make sure that

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.229 
recovery but we will make sure that
there<00:00:48.149> are<00:00:48.239> no<00:00:48.420> color<00:00:48.719> shifts<00:00:49.230> in<00:00:49.320> your<00:00:49.590> image

00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:50.239 
there are no color shifts in your image

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:52.760 
there are no color shifts in your image
finally<00:00:51.239> there's<00:00:51.420> paint<00:00:51.780> overlay<00:00:52.289> which<00:00:52.559> is

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
finally there's paint overlay which is

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.680 
finally there's paint overlay which is
fine<00:00:53.070> to<00:00:53.309> use<00:00:53.489> if<00:00:53.699> you're<00:00:53.820> going<00:00:53.879> to<00:00:54.300> deliver

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
fine to use if you're going to deliver

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.900 
fine to use if you're going to deliver
your<00:00:54.899> final<00:00:55.289> image<00:00:55.469> for<00:00:56.160> presentation<00:00:56.789> on<00:00:56.879> a

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
your final image for presentation on a

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.090 
your final image for presentation on a
screen<00:00:57.329> but<00:00:57.660> just<00:00:58.109> be<00:00:58.199> a<00:00:58.230> little<00:00:58.559> bit<00:00:58.859> cautious

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
screen but just be a little bit cautious

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.720 
screen but just be a little bit cautious
I<00:00:59.600> tend<00:01:00.600> to<00:01:00.719> notice<00:01:01.020> that<00:01:01.350> if<00:01:01.469> I<00:01:01.590> print<00:01:02.039> with

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
I tend to notice that if I print with

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.119 
I tend to notice that if I print with
this<00:01:02.940> post<00:01:03.239> crop<00:01:03.480> vignette<00:01:03.930> to<00:01:04.170> set<00:01:04.439> to<00:01:04.650> paint

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
this post crop vignette to set to paint

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.010 
this post crop vignette to set to paint
overlay<00:01:05.610> it<00:01:05.850> tends<00:01:06.240> to<00:01:06.360> get<00:01:06.570> a<00:01:06.600> little<00:01:06.810> bit

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
overlay it tends to get a little bit

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.130 
overlay it tends to get a little bit
muddy<00:01:07.320> so<00:01:08.070> I'm<00:01:08.280> going<00:01:08.430> to<00:01:08.490> choose<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:09.030> color

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:09.140 
muddy so I'm going to choose the color

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.539 
muddy so I'm going to choose the color
priority<00:01:10.140> and<00:01:10.290> then<00:01:10.740> for<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.010> amount<00:01:11.340> you'll

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
priority and then for the amount you'll

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:12.920 
priority and then for the amount you'll
notice<00:01:11.790> if<00:01:11.909> I<00:01:12.000> move<00:01:12.210> to<00:01:12.240> the<00:01:12.479> left<00:01:12.689> it<00:01:12.869> will

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
notice if I move to the left it will

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.649 
notice if I move to the left it will
darken<00:01:13.229> down<00:01:13.799> the<00:01:14.040> edges<00:01:14.220> of<00:01:14.610> my<00:01:14.640> file<00:01:15.030> if<00:01:15.270> I

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
darken down the edges of my file if I

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.390 
darken down the edges of my file if I
move<00:01:15.900> to<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:16.080> right<00:01:16.200> it<00:01:16.619> will<00:01:16.860> lighten<00:01:17.130> them

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
move to the right it will lighten them

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.249 
move to the right it will lighten them
let's<00:01:18.030> go<00:01:18.210> ahead<00:01:18.299> and<00:01:18.479> start<00:01:18.810> by<00:01:18.990> just

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
let's go ahead and start by just

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.890 
let's go ahead and start by just
darkening<00:01:19.799> down<00:01:20.159> those<00:01:20.460> edges<00:01:20.970> I'm<00:01:21.240> going<00:01:21.840> to

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
darkening down those edges I'm going to

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.840 
darkening down those edges I'm going to
do<00:01:22.049> this<00:01:22.200> quite<00:01:22.619> significantly<00:01:23.310> so<00:01:23.549> we<00:01:23.729> can

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
do this quite significantly so we can

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.760 
do this quite significantly so we can
look<00:01:24.000> at<00:01:24.090> the<00:01:24.180> other<00:01:24.210> options<00:01:24.810> so<00:01:25.439> the

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
look at the other options so the

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.320 
look at the other options so the
midpoint<00:01:26.040> you'll<00:01:26.490> notice<00:01:26.729> as<00:01:26.850> I<00:01:26.970> move<00:01:27.000> to<00:01:27.299> the

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
midpoint you'll notice as I move to the

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.289 
midpoint you'll notice as I move to the
left<00:01:27.420> moves<00:01:27.900> into<00:01:28.229> the<00:01:28.320> image<00:01:28.619> or<00:01:29.060> remains<00:01:30.060> on

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
left moves into the image or remains on

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.030 
left moves into the image or remains on
the<00:01:30.420> edges<00:01:30.869> if<00:01:31.049> I<00:01:31.200> move<00:01:31.409> it<00:01:31.530> to<00:01:31.560> the<00:01:31.890> right

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
the edges if I move it to the right

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.490 
the edges if I move it to the right
let's<00:01:32.700> move<00:01:32.850> it<00:01:33.030> in<00:01:33.180> towards<00:01:33.720> the<00:01:33.900> center<00:01:34.320> and

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
let's move it in towards the center and

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.620 
let's move it in towards the center and
then<00:01:34.920> we<00:01:35.009> can<00:01:35.130> change<00:01:35.400> the<00:01:35.610> roundness<00:01:36.090> so<00:01:36.420> as<00:01:36.540> I

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
then we can change the roundness so as I

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:37.969 
then we can change the roundness so as I
move<00:01:36.840> this<00:01:36.960> over<00:01:37.110> to<00:01:37.259> the<00:01:37.439> left<00:01:37.710> you'll<00:01:37.950> notice

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
move this over to the left you'll notice

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.850 
move this over to the left you'll notice
that<00:01:38.400> it<00:01:38.549> becomes<00:01:39.180> more<00:01:39.450> of<00:01:39.689> a<00:01:39.750> rectangle<00:01:40.470> if<00:01:40.770> I

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
that it becomes more of a rectangle if I

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.170 
that it becomes more of a rectangle if I
move<00:01:41.040> it<00:01:41.130> to<00:01:41.220> the<00:01:41.310> right<00:01:41.520> it's<00:01:41.790> more<00:01:42.000> of<00:01:42.090> a

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
move it to the right it's more of a

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.440 
move it to the right it's more of a
circle<00:01:42.829> we<00:01:43.829> can<00:01:43.950> also<00:01:44.159> add<00:01:44.520> a<00:01:44.790> feather<00:01:45.119> to

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
circle we can also add a feather to

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.660 
circle we can also add a feather to
soften<00:01:46.020> or<00:01:46.170> harden<00:01:46.560> those<00:01:46.680> edges<00:01:47.100> to<00:01:47.340> the<00:01:47.430> left

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
soften or harden those edges to the left

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.609 
soften or harden those edges to the left
it's<00:01:47.880> going<00:01:47.909> to<00:01:48.060> make<00:01:48.210> a<00:01:48.240> hard<00:01:48.600> edge<00:01:48.899> and<00:01:49.200> to

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
it's going to make a hard edge and to

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.620 
it's going to make a hard edge and to
the<00:01:49.710> right<00:01:49.920> it'll<00:01:50.159> give<00:01:50.340> us<00:01:50.460> a<00:01:50.549> nice<00:01:50.790> soft<00:01:51.240> edge

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
the right it'll give us a nice soft edge

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.929 
the right it'll give us a nice soft edge
all<00:01:52.470> right<00:01:52.619> so<00:01:52.740> I<00:01:52.770> have<00:01:52.920> the<00:01:53.070> shape<00:01:53.399> defined

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
all right so I have the shape defined

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.520 
all right so I have the shape defined
the<00:01:54.119> way<00:01:54.210> I<00:01:54.240> want<00:01:54.600> it<00:01:54.720> but<00:01:55.049> I<00:01:55.079> want<00:01:55.140> to<00:01:55.320> change

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
the way I want it but I want to change

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.010 
the way I want it but I want to change
the<00:01:55.829> amount<00:01:56.219> so<00:01:56.700> I'll<00:01:56.820> just<00:01:57.060> decrease<00:01:57.719> that<00:01:57.990> a

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
the amount so I'll just decrease that a

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.800 
the amount so I'll just decrease that a
little<00:01:58.380> bit<00:01:58.850> all<00:01:59.850> right<00:01:59.909> now<00:02:00.390> I'm<00:02:00.630> actually

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
little bit all right now I'm actually

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.139 
little bit all right now I'm actually
going<00:02:01.140> to<00:02:01.229> crop<00:02:01.740> the<00:02:01.979> image<00:02:02.009> so<00:02:02.460> I'll<00:02:02.579> tap<00:02:02.880> the

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
going to crop the image so I'll tap the

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.179 
going to crop the image so I'll tap the
R<00:02:03.299> key<00:02:03.689> and<00:02:03.930> I<00:02:04.290> want<00:02:04.469> to<00:02:04.530> crop<00:02:04.710> this<00:02:04.950> to<00:02:05.159> a

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
R key and I want to crop this to a

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.760 
R key and I want to crop this to a
square<00:02:05.700> so<00:02:06.030> I'll<00:02:06.149> select<00:02:06.450> one<00:02:06.600> to<00:02:07.110> one<00:02:07.350> for<00:02:07.649> my

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
square so I'll select one to one for my

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.609 
square so I'll select one to one for my
aspect<00:02:08.280> ratio<00:02:08.700> and<00:02:08.910> then<00:02:09.479> just<00:02:09.750> reposition

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
aspect ratio and then just reposition

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.369 
aspect ratio and then just reposition
this<00:02:10.830> and<00:02:11.069> tap<00:02:11.700> return<00:02:12.150> or<00:02:12.330> enter<00:02:12.720> because<00:02:13.290> I

00:02:13.369 --> 00:02:13.379 
this and tap return or enter because I

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:13.940 
this and tap return or enter because I
want<00:02:13.560> to<00:02:13.620> show

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
want to show

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.309 
want to show
you<00:02:14.010> that<00:02:14.220> while<00:02:14.730> I<00:02:14.760> was<00:02:14.940> cropping<00:02:15.780> I<00:02:15.930> actually

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 
you that while I was cropping I actually

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:18.830 
you that while I was cropping I actually
couldn't<00:02:16.770> see<00:02:17.160> the<00:02:17.370> post<00:02:17.580> crop<00:02:17.849> vignette<00:02:18.269> but

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
couldn't see the post crop vignette but

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.229 
couldn't see the post crop vignette but
after<00:02:19.319> I<00:02:19.349> cropped<00:02:19.739> the<00:02:19.980> image<00:02:20.010> the<00:02:20.700> post<00:02:20.970> crop

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.239 
after I cropped the image the post crop

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:24.229 
after I cropped the image the post crop
vignette<00:02:21.690> is<00:02:21.870> actually<00:02:22.319> recreated<00:02:23.160> based<00:02:23.910> on

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:24.239 
vignette is actually recreated based on

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:27.500 
vignette is actually recreated based on
the<00:02:24.690> new<00:02:24.959> dimensions<00:02:25.860> of<00:02:26.099> the<00:02:26.489> image<00:02:26.879> so<00:02:27.060> it

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
the new dimensions of the image so it

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.869 
the new dimensions of the image so it
will<00:02:27.629> go<00:02:27.750> ahead<00:02:27.870> and<00:02:28.110> conform<00:02:28.650> to<00:02:28.800> any<00:02:29.459> crop

00:02:29.869 --> 00:02:29.879 
will go ahead and conform to any crop

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:32.690 
will go ahead and conform to any crop
that<00:02:30.120> you<00:02:30.239> have<00:02:30.830> alright<00:02:31.830> if<00:02:32.010> I<00:02:32.130> really<00:02:32.519> want

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
that you have alright if I really want

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.699 
that you have alright if I really want
to<00:02:32.819> make<00:02:32.970> this<00:02:33.180> look<00:02:33.510> more<00:02:33.840> vintage<00:02:34.319> then

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709 
to make this look more vintage then

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:37.190 
to make this look more vintage then
probably<00:02:35.190> instead<00:02:35.730> of<00:02:35.819> adding<00:02:36.030> a<00:02:36.360> dark

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
probably instead of adding a dark

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.080 
probably instead of adding a dark
vignette<00:02:37.500> I'll<00:02:37.860> want<00:02:38.370> to<00:02:38.519> add<00:02:38.670> a<00:02:38.700> light

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
vignette I'll want to add a light

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.240 
vignette I'll want to add a light
vignette<00:02:39.540> so<00:02:39.959> I'll<00:02:40.110> scoot<00:02:40.380> all<00:02:40.590> the<00:02:40.860> way<00:02:40.950> over

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
vignette so I'll scoot all the way over

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.490 
vignette so I'll scoot all the way over
to<00:02:41.430> the<00:02:41.519> right<00:02:41.549> and<00:02:42.060> I'm<00:02:42.660> also<00:02:42.989> going<00:02:43.379> to

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
to the right and I'm also going to

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.949 
to the right and I'm also going to
remove<00:02:43.920> the<00:02:44.370> feather<00:02:44.610> giving<00:02:45.180> me<00:02:45.299> a<00:02:45.330> harder

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
remove the feather giving me a harder

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:49.070 
remove the feather giving me a harder
edge<00:02:46.110> like<00:02:46.620> this<00:02:47.000> now<00:02:48.000> we'll<00:02:48.269> scroll<00:02:48.540> down<00:02:48.840> and

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
edge like this now we'll scroll down and

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.920 
edge like this now we'll scroll down and
we<00:02:49.500> have<00:02:49.709> some<00:02:49.920> options<00:02:50.400> for<00:02:50.489> grain<00:02:51.209> as<00:02:51.510> I'm

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
we have some options for grain as I'm

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.750 
we have some options for grain as I'm
deciding<00:02:52.349> how<00:02:52.500> much<00:02:52.680> grain<00:02:52.950> I<00:02:52.980> want<00:02:53.310> to<00:02:53.430> apply

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
deciding how much grain I want to apply

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.990 
deciding how much grain I want to apply
I<00:02:54.060> will<00:02:54.540> typically<00:02:54.930> zoom<00:02:55.410> into<00:02:56.010> my<00:02:56.160> image<00:02:56.430> to<00:02:56.640> a

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
I will typically zoom into my image to a

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.630 
I will typically zoom into my image to a
hundred<00:02:57.510> percent<00:02:57.660> and<00:02:58.079> in<00:02:58.829> this<00:02:58.980> case<00:02:59.220> I<00:02:59.400> want

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
hundred percent and in this case I want

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.910 
hundred percent and in this case I want
to<00:02:59.670> use<00:02:59.790> the<00:02:59.940> hand<00:03:00.209> tool<00:03:00.450> and<00:03:00.829> reposition<00:03:01.829> it

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
to use the hand tool and reposition it

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.800 
to use the hand tool and reposition it
so<00:03:02.099> I'm<00:03:02.220> looking<00:03:02.549> at<00:03:02.640> my<00:03:02.790> image<00:03:03.060> in<00:03:03.360> the<00:03:03.480> sharp

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
so I'm looking at my image in the sharp

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:06.559 
so I'm looking at my image in the sharp
areas<00:03:04.290> here<00:03:04.709> and<00:03:04.860> then<00:03:05.459> I<00:03:05.549> will<00:03:05.730> add<00:03:05.910> the

00:03:06.559 --> 00:03:06.569 
areas here and then I will add the

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:09.020 
areas here and then I will add the
amount<00:03:06.870> I'll<00:03:07.140> add<00:03:07.920> a<00:03:07.950> lot<00:03:08.310> to<00:03:08.519> be<00:03:08.610> sure<00:03:08.790> that<00:03:08.940> we

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
amount I'll add a lot to be sure that we

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:10.069 
amount I'll add a lot to be sure that we
can<00:03:09.150> see<00:03:09.390> it<00:03:09.480> on-screen

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:10.079 
can see it on-screen

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:12.830 
can see it on-screen
so<00:03:10.590> the<00:03:10.950> amount<00:03:11.400> is<00:03:11.700> going<00:03:12.030> to<00:03:12.180> be<00:03:12.299> how<00:03:12.510> much

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
so the amount is going to be how much

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.860 
so the amount is going to be how much
grain<00:03:13.470> and<00:03:13.769> the<00:03:14.340> amount<00:03:14.700> of<00:03:14.849> contrast<00:03:15.540> in<00:03:15.720> the

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
grain and the amount of contrast in the

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:19.009 
grain and the amount of contrast in the
grain<00:03:16.110> the<00:03:16.980> size<00:03:17.310> will<00:03:17.970> actually<00:03:18.450> increase

00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:19.019 
grain the size will actually increase

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:21.830 
grain the size will actually increase
the<00:03:19.440> physical<00:03:19.920> size<00:03:20.190> of<00:03:20.549> the<00:03:20.670> grain<00:03:20.970> and<00:03:21.239> then

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
the physical size of the grain and then

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.930 
the physical size of the grain and then
we<00:03:22.049> can<00:03:22.200> see<00:03:22.590> with<00:03:22.889> the<00:03:23.010> roughness<00:03:23.459> if<00:03:23.639> I<00:03:23.730> move

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
we can see with the roughness if I move

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:25.490 
we can see with the roughness if I move
it<00:03:24.060> over<00:03:24.269> to<00:03:24.389> the<00:03:24.510> right<00:03:24.660> it<00:03:25.049> looks<00:03:25.260> a<00:03:25.350> lot

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
it over to the right it looks a lot

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.949 
it over to the right it looks a lot
rougher<00:03:25.859> a<00:03:26.100> lot<00:03:26.370> blotch<00:03:26.730> here<00:03:27.060> if<00:03:27.209> I<00:03:27.569> move<00:03:27.840> it

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959 
rougher a lot blotch here if I move it

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:29.870 
rougher a lot blotch here if I move it
over<00:03:28.260> to<00:03:28.440> the<00:03:28.530> left<00:03:28.799> you<00:03:29.250> can<00:03:29.370> see<00:03:29.549> it's<00:03:29.670> almost

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:29.880 
over to the left you can see it's almost

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.000 
over to the left you can see it's almost
like<00:03:30.150> I<00:03:30.359> get<00:03:30.510> this<00:03:30.660> reticulation<00:03:31.470> effect

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
like I get this reticulation effect

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:33.740 
like I get this reticulation effect
which<00:03:32.489> is<00:03:32.700> an<00:03:32.819> effect<00:03:33.120> that<00:03:33.299> you<00:03:33.420> used<00:03:33.630> to<00:03:33.690> be

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
which is an effect that you used to be

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:35.720 
which is an effect that you used to be
able<00:03:33.870> to<00:03:34.049> get<00:03:34.200> as<00:03:34.350> you<00:03:34.410> processed<00:03:35.130> your<00:03:35.310> film

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730 
able to get as you processed your film

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:38.090 
able to get as you processed your film
in<00:03:35.970> the<00:03:36.209> darkroom<00:03:36.600> so<00:03:37.350> really<00:03:37.620> these<00:03:37.769> are<00:03:37.829> all

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:38.100 
in the darkroom so really these are all

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:40.520 
in the darkroom so really these are all
just<00:03:38.400> aesthetic<00:03:39.000> choices<00:03:39.389> all<00:03:39.750> you<00:03:40.230> need<00:03:40.410> to

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
just aesthetic choices all you need to

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:42.410 
just aesthetic choices all you need to
do<00:03:40.650> is<00:03:40.769> move<00:03:40.889> the<00:03:41.069> sliders<00:03:41.549> to<00:03:41.730> get<00:03:42.090> the<00:03:42.209> amount

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420 
do is move the sliders to get the amount

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:44.840 
do is move the sliders to get the amount
of<00:03:42.630> grain<00:03:42.930> that<00:03:43.109> you<00:03:43.170> want<00:03:43.530> if<00:03:44.130> you<00:03:44.370> are<00:03:44.579> going

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:44.850 
of grain that you want if you are going

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:46.610 
of grain that you want if you are going
to<00:03:44.970> be<00:03:45.150> printing<00:03:45.660> this<00:03:45.810> I<00:03:46.019> would<00:03:46.170> make<00:03:46.319> sure

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
to be printing this I would make sure

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:49.580 
to be printing this I would make sure
that<00:03:46.650> you<00:03:47.040> do<00:03:47.190> a<00:03:47.220> few<00:03:47.519> tests<00:03:48.000> in<00:03:48.120> order<00:03:48.630> to<00:03:49.079> see

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590 
that you do a few tests in order to see

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:51.770 
that you do a few tests in order to see
the<00:03:49.829> amount<00:03:50.100> of<00:03:50.190> grain<00:03:50.579> as<00:03:50.880> its<00:03:51.120> applied<00:03:51.510> on

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780 
the amount of grain as its applied on

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:54.650 
the amount of grain as its applied on
paper<00:03:52.049> because<00:03:52.470> I<00:03:52.620> tend<00:03:53.250> to<00:03:53.370> think<00:03:53.609> that<00:03:53.940> what

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660 
paper because I tend to think that what

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:56.330 
paper because I tend to think that what
the<00:03:54.840> amount<00:03:55.170> of<00:03:55.319> grain<00:03:55.560> is<00:03:55.769> that<00:03:55.980> looks<00:03:56.130> good

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 
the amount of grain is that looks good

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:58.039 
the amount of grain is that looks good
on<00:03:56.370> the<00:03:56.700> screen<00:03:57.090> is<00:03:57.299> a<00:03:57.329> little<00:03:57.569> bit<00:03:57.690> different

00:03:58.039 --> 00:03:58.049 
on the screen is a little bit different

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:00.289 
on the screen is a little bit different
when<00:03:58.200> I<00:03:58.230> actually<00:03:58.470> print<00:03:59.160> the<00:03:59.310> image<00:03:59.670> all

00:04:00.289 --> 00:04:00.299 
when I actually print the image all

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:01.910 
when I actually print the image all
right<00:04:00.510> so<00:04:00.690> let's<00:04:00.870> just<00:04:00.959> zoom<00:04:01.170> out<00:04:01.590> a<00:04:01.680> little

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920 
right so let's just zoom out a little

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:04.370 
right so let's just zoom out a little
bit<00:04:02.130> here<00:04:02.489> and<00:04:02.639> then<00:04:03.030> to<00:04:03.299> make<00:04:03.450> just<00:04:03.660> one<00:04:03.930> final

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:04.380 
bit here and then to make just one final

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:06.500 
bit here and then to make just one final
adjustment<00:04:04.650> to<00:04:05.310> this<00:04:05.400> image<00:04:05.700> if<00:04:05.940> I<00:04:06.000> really<00:04:06.269> do

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 
adjustment to this image if I really do

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:09.379 
adjustment to this image if I really do
want<00:04:06.780> it<00:04:06.900> to<00:04:06.930> look<00:04:07.530> more<00:04:07.769> vintage<00:04:08.579> I'll<00:04:08.790> scroll

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:09.389 
want it to look more vintage I'll scroll

00:04:09.389 --> 00:04:12.470 
want it to look more vintage I'll scroll
up<00:04:09.630> to<00:04:09.690> the<00:04:10.139> tone<00:04:10.470> curve<00:04:10.919> area<00:04:11.459> I<00:04:11.700> want<00:04:12.329> to

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.480 
up to the tone curve area I want to

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:16.610 
up to the tone curve area I want to
decrease<00:04:13.380> my<00:04:13.859> blacks<00:04:14.700> and<00:04:15.120> your<00:04:15.989> tone<00:04:16.289> curve

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:16.620 
decrease my blacks and your tone curve

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:18.349 
decrease my blacks and your tone curve
might<00:04:17.160> look<00:04:17.190> a<00:04:17.430> little<00:04:17.459> bit<00:04:17.760> different<00:04:18.209> it

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:18.359 
might look a little bit different it

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:21.289 
might look a little bit different it
depends<00:04:18.810> on<00:04:18.959> if<00:04:19.229> you<00:04:19.769> are<00:04:19.950> in<00:04:20.190> this<00:04:20.400> parametric

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:21.299 
depends on if you are in this parametric

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:22.969 
depends on if you are in this parametric
curve<00:04:21.690> right<00:04:22.019> here<00:04:22.049> that<00:04:22.500> has<00:04:22.680> all<00:04:22.710> these

00:04:22.969 --> 00:04:22.979 
curve right here that has all these

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:25.909 
curve right here that has all these
sliders<00:04:23.550> or<00:04:23.820> if<00:04:24.630> you<00:04:24.780> scroll<00:04:25.260> down<00:04:25.320> and<00:04:25.860> you

sliders or if you scroll down and you

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:27.090 
sliders or if you scroll down and you
click<00:04:26.130> on<00:04:26.340> this<00:04:26.550> icon

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:29.190 
click on this icon
right<00:04:27.220> here<00:04:27.580> this<00:04:28.030> is<00:04:28.090> actually<00:04:28.450> the<00:04:28.810> point

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:29.200 
right here this is actually the point

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.200 
right here this is actually the point
curve<00:04:29.560> this<00:04:29.800> is<00:04:29.860> the<00:04:29.980> curve<00:04:30.100> that<00:04:30.310> I<00:04:30.700> prefer

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:31.210 
curve this is the curve that I prefer

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:33.330 
curve this is the curve that I prefer
because<00:04:31.780> it<00:04:31.870> allows<00:04:32.140> me<00:04:32.170> to<00:04:32.440> put<00:04:32.620> points

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:33.340 
because it allows me to put points

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:36.000 
because it allows me to put points
anywhere<00:04:33.850> on<00:04:34.030> the<00:04:34.330> curve<00:04:34.630> and<00:04:34.840> I<00:04:35.500> can<00:04:35.710> quickly

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:36.010 
anywhere on the curve and I can quickly

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:39.060 
anywhere on the curve and I can quickly
select<00:04:36.850> my<00:04:37.390> black<00:04:37.840> point<00:04:38.260> here<00:04:38.530> in<00:04:38.710> the<00:04:38.860> lower

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:39.070 
select my black point here in the lower

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:42.270 
select my black point here in the lower
left-hand<00:04:39.520> corner<00:04:39.730> and<00:04:40.150> just<00:04:40.810> drag<00:04:41.260> up<00:04:41.590> which

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:42.280 
left-hand corner and just drag up which

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:44.630 
left-hand corner and just drag up which
is<00:04:42.400> basically<00:04:42.700> restricting<00:04:43.480> or<00:04:43.690> limiting<00:04:44.440> the

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:44.640 
is basically restricting or limiting the

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:47.700 
is basically restricting or limiting the
darkest<00:04:45.640> value<00:04:46.150> of<00:04:46.360> my<00:04:46.600> image<00:04:46.960> and<00:04:47.170> you<00:04:47.500> see

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:47.710 
darkest value of my image and you see

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:49.200 
darkest value of my image and you see
that<00:04:47.860> a<00:04:47.920> lot<00:04:48.130> with<00:04:48.190> the<00:04:48.520> kind<00:04:48.850> of<00:04:48.910> vintage

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:49.210 
that a lot with the kind of vintage

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:51.420 
that a lot with the kind of vintage
images<00:04:49.810> or<00:04:50.410> the<00:04:50.470> images<00:04:50.740> that<00:04:50.800> are<00:04:50.980> made<00:04:51.190> to

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:51.430 
images or the images that are made to

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:53.610 
images or the images that are made to
look<00:04:51.610> older<00:04:51.970> they<00:04:52.270> won't<00:04:52.510> have<00:04:52.810> a<00:04:52.840> true<00:04:53.260> black

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:53.620 
look older they won't have a true black

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:55.680 
look older they won't have a true black
in<00:04:53.890> them<00:04:54.040> so<00:04:54.220> that's<00:04:54.340> an<00:04:54.520> easy<00:04:54.790> way<00:04:54.970> to<00:04:55.510> control

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:55.690 
in them so that's an easy way to control

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:58.170 
in them so that's an easy way to control
that<00:04:56.080> with<00:04:56.350> the<00:04:56.440> tone<00:04:56.680> curve<00:04:56.920> so<00:04:57.760> there<00:04:57.910> you<00:04:58.000> go

00:04:58.170 --> 00:04:58.180 
that with the tone curve so there you go

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:00.510 
that with the tone curve so there you go
post<00:04:58.630> crop<00:04:58.870> vignetting<00:04:59.110> as<00:04:59.590> well<00:04:59.830> as<00:05:00.070> grain
