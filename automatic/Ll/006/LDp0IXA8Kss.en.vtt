why are they peptide bond it well when

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.020 
why are they peptide bond it well when
I'm<00:00:31.410> BCA<00:00:31.980> or<00:00:32.550> any<00:00:32.700> amino<00:00:33.090> is<00:00:33.540> peptide<00:00:34.500> bond<00:00:34.800> it

see it 10 grams BCA's 2 grams of CLA and

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.000 
see it 10 grams BCA's 2 grams of CLA and
a<00:01:02.129> half<00:01:02.340> a<00:01:02.460> grand<00:01:02.699> magma<00:01:03.149> teen<00:01:03.329> now<00:01:04.019> CLA<00:01:04.619> helps

a half a grand magma teen now CLA helps

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.060 
a half a grand magma teen now CLA helps
your<00:01:05.189> body<00:01:05.400> use<00:01:05.820> store<00:01:06.750> fat<00:01:07.080> his<00:01:07.439> energy<00:01:07.860> and

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
your body use store fat his energy and

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.730 
your body use store fat his energy and
then<00:01:09.060> you<00:01:09.270> got<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:09.540> agmatine<00:01:09.930> to<00:01:10.350> increase

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
then you got the agmatine to increase

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.859 
then you got the agmatine to increase
blood<00:01:11.130> flow<00:01:11.189> then<00:01:12.090> you<00:01:12.210> get<00:01:12.360> your<00:01:12.390> peptide

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
blood flow then you get your peptide

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.560 
blood flow then you get your peptide
bond<00:01:13.140> at<00:01:13.320> 10<00:01:13.500> grams<00:01:13.530> amino<00:01:14.159> acids<00:01:14.580> /<00:01:15.060> 2<00:01:15.270> scoops

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
bond at 10 grams amino acids / 2 scoops

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.920 
bond at 10 grams amino acids / 2 scoops
so<00:01:16.430> overall<00:01:17.430> this<00:01:17.610> is<00:01:17.670> a<00:01:17.820> very<00:01:18.180> effective

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
so overall this is a very effective

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.950 
so overall this is a very effective
primed<00:01:19.619> I<00:01:20.009> like<00:01:20.700> it<00:01:20.880> tastes<00:01:21.390> great<00:01:21.720> this

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
primed I like it tastes great this

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.140 
primed I like it tastes great this
flavor<00:01:22.229> right<00:01:22.500> here<00:01:22.740> is<00:01:23.580> that<00:01:23.640> the<00:01:23.970> blue

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
flavor right here is that the blue

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.420 
flavor right here is that the blue
raspberry<00:01:24.450> flavor<00:01:25.110> I<00:01:25.409> can't<00:01:25.770> see<00:01:26.070> that<00:01:26.750> yeah<00:01:27.750> I

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:28.430 
raspberry flavor I can't see that yeah I

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:31.520 
raspberry flavor I can't see that yeah I
also<00:01:29.430> had<00:01:29.670> the<00:01:29.820> watermelon<00:01:30.450> watermelon<00:01:31.079> takes

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
also had the watermelon watermelon takes

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.429 
also had the watermelon watermelon takes
terrific<00:01:32.040> as<00:01:32.189> well<00:01:32.729> some<00:01:33.570> reason<00:01:33.900> with<00:01:34.170> this

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
terrific as well some reason with this

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.800 
terrific as well some reason with this
the<00:01:34.890> blue<00:01:35.070> raspberry<00:01:35.280> kind<00:01:36.270> of<00:01:36.360> mixes<00:01:36.659> up

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
the blue raspberry kind of mixes up

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:42.140 
the blue raspberry kind of mixes up
weird<00:01:37.049> like<00:01:37.409> you<00:01:37.530> shake<00:01:37.799> it<00:01:38.900> shake<00:01:39.900> it<00:01:39.960> and<00:01:41.150> a

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
weird like you shake it shake it and a

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.960 
weird like you shake it shake it and a
lot<00:01:42.720> of<00:01:42.780> stuff<00:01:42.990> floats<00:01:43.290> to<00:01:43.439> the<00:01:43.500> bottom<00:01:43.970> it

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
lot of stuff floats to the bottom it

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.249 
lot of stuff floats to the bottom it
doesn't<00:01:45.270> do<00:01:45.329> that<00:01:45.420> with<00:01:45.570> a<00:01:45.630> watermelon<00:01:45.899> when

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
doesn't do that with a watermelon when

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:47.780 
doesn't do that with a watermelon when
you<00:01:46.320> shake<00:01:46.530> up<00:01:46.649> the<00:01:46.740> watermelon<00:01:47.009> and<00:01:47.369> mixes<00:01:47.670> up

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
you shake up the watermelon and mixes up

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.260 
you shake up the watermelon and mixes up
clear<00:01:48.770> nothing's<00:01:49.770> floating<00:01:50.030> but<00:01:51.030> the<00:01:51.119> blue

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
clear nothing's floating but the blue

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.359 
clear nothing's floating but the blue
raspberry<00:01:51.479> gets<00:01:52.350> kind<00:01:52.680> of<00:01:52.770> like<00:01:52.860> it's<00:01:53.220> not

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
raspberry gets kind of like it's not

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.969 
raspberry gets kind of like it's not
gritty<00:01:53.670> with<00:01:53.970> sticks<00:01:54.840> to<00:01:54.930> your<00:01:55.020> teeth<00:01:55.290> so

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
gritty with sticks to your teeth so

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.010 
gritty with sticks to your teeth so
weird<00:01:56.189> No<00:01:56.399> No<00:01:56.549> maybe<00:01:56.579> just<00:01:57.000> a<00:01:57.090> flavoring<00:01:57.509> is

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
weird No No maybe just a flavoring is

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.800 
weird No No maybe just a flavoring is
off<00:01:58.290> but<00:01:58.590> either<00:01:59.579> way<00:01:59.820> it<00:01:59.850> tastes<00:02:00.180> great<00:02:00.360> so

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
off but either way it tastes great so

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.789 
off but either way it tastes great so
BPI<00:02:01.229> products<00:02:01.770> taste<00:02:02.040> great<00:02:02.340> and<00:02:03.590> it's<00:02:04.590> 30

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
BPI products taste great and it's 30
