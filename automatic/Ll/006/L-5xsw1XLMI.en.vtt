two spot we have the things you can hack
on<00:01:04.750> the<00:01:05.590> map<00:01:05.950> now<00:01:06.729> this<00:01:07.090> is<00:01:07.240> more<00:01:07.539> of<00:01:07.660> a<00:01:07.750> trick

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:07.990 
on the map now this is more of a trick

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:09.540 
on the map now this is more of a trick
than<00:01:08.170> a<00:01:08.259> secret<00:01:08.619> that<00:01:08.800> there<00:01:08.950> may<00:01:09.130> be<00:01:09.160> some

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:09.550 
than a secret that there may be some

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:11.190 
than a secret that there may be some
things<00:01:09.729> you<00:01:09.940> don't<00:01:10.210> know<00:01:10.479> what<00:01:10.690> you<00:01:10.840> can<00:01:11.020> hack

with<00:01:11.410> and<00:01:11.710> the<00:01:12.520> things<00:01:12.700> you<00:01:12.850> can<00:01:13.000> hack<00:01:13.179> our

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:13.420 
with and the things you can hack our

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:16.710 
with and the things you can hack our
doors<00:01:13.869> which<00:01:14.229> I<00:01:14.350> believe<00:01:14.619> it<00:01:14.880> 200<00:01:15.880> points<00:01:16.270> you

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:16.720 
doors which I believe it 200 points you

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.830 
doors which I believe it 200 points you
can<00:01:16.869> hack<00:01:17.080> weapons<00:01:17.649> to<00:01:17.890> get<00:01:18.099> ammo<00:01:18.700> and<00:01:19.060> also

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:19.840 
can hack weapons to get ammo and also

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.199 
can hack weapons to get ammo and also
the<00:01:19.990> weapon<00:01:20.319> for<00:01:20.619> more<00:01:21.610> than<00:01:21.789> what<00:01:21.910> it's<00:01:22.060> worth

00:01:22.199 --> 00:01:22.209 
the weapon for more than what it's worth

00:01:22.209 --> 00:01:25.440 
the weapon for more than what it's worth
but<00:01:22.569> I<00:01:22.630> believe<00:01:23.020> it<00:01:23.200> does<00:01:23.380> give<00:01:23.649> you<00:01:24.060> free<00:01:25.060> ammo

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:25.450

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:28.350 
but I believe it does give you free ammo
at<00:01:25.720> the<00:01:25.899> time<00:01:26.110> and<00:01:26.349> yeah<00:01:26.979> it's<00:01:27.220> a<00:01:27.429> lot<00:01:27.729> easier

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:28.360 
at the time and yeah it's a lot easier

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.900 
at the time and yeah it's a lot easier
you<00:01:28.810> can<00:01:28.959> also<00:01:29.110> hack<00:01:29.530> window<00:01:30.099> barriers<00:01:30.640> to

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:30.910 
you can also hack window barriers to

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:32.639 
you can also hack window barriers to
rebuild<00:01:31.539> and<00:01:31.690> it<00:01:31.780> also<00:01:31.959> gives<00:01:32.289> you<00:01:32.380> a<00:01:32.440> lot<00:01:32.590> more

00:01:32.639 --> 00:01:32.649 
rebuild and it also gives you a lot more

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:35.279 
rebuild and it also gives you a lot more
money<00:01:32.979> you<00:01:33.550> can<00:01:33.610> hack<00:01:33.940> the<00:01:34.149> pack-a-punch<00:01:34.720> area
