00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
getting into league of legends I've

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:12.830 
getting into league of legends I've
referenced<00:00:11.460> that<00:00:11.849> video<00:00:12.150> and<00:00:12.330> what<00:00:12.480> feels

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
League of Legends I started playing

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.410

league<00:02:08.009> when<00:02:08.190> I<00:02:08.250> was<00:02:08.369> pretty<00:02:08.490> young<00:02:08.610> and<00:02:09.149> it

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
league when I was pretty young and it

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.240 
league when I was pretty young and it
might<00:02:09.690> sound<00:02:09.990> like<00:02:10.259> nonsense<00:02:10.770> but<00:02:10.979> I<00:02:11.039> honestly
