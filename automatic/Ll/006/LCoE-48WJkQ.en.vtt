00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
we were supposed to put an earthquake

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.050 
we were supposed to put an earthquake

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
first yes that's correct

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.380 
first yes that's correct
earthquake<00:00:24.720> and<00:00:24.930> then<00:00:25.199> lightnings<00:00:26.060> and<00:00:27.060> we're

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
earthquake and then lightnings and we're

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.390 
earthquake and then lightnings and we're
gonna<00:00:27.480> try<00:00:27.630> and<00:00:27.750> take<00:00:27.840> this<00:00:27.990> thing<00:00:28.170> out<00:00:28.400> now

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
gonna try and take this thing out now

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.130 
gonna try and take this thing out now
this<00:00:29.519> is<00:00:29.699> actually<00:00:30.300> I<00:00:30.330> think<00:00:30.510> this<00:00:30.750> is<00:00:30.869> level<00:00:31.109> 5

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
this is actually I think this is level 5

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.350 
this is actually I think this is level 5
it<00:00:31.560> doesn't<00:00:31.710> have<00:00:32.009> the<00:00:32.189> gold<00:00:32.550> bars<00:00:32.940> on<00:00:33.270> the

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
it doesn't have the gold bars on the

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.350 
it doesn't have the gold bars on the
outside<00:00:34.040> corners<00:00:35.040> of<00:00:35.340> the<00:00:35.640> clan<00:00:35.790> castle<00:00:36.000> so

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
outside corners of the clan castle so

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:37.970 
outside corners of the clan castle so
that<00:00:36.390> means<00:00:36.690> it's<00:00:36.899> a<00:00:36.989> level<00:00:37.170> 5<00:00:37.380> let's<00:00:37.710> try<00:00:37.920> it

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
that means it's a level 5 let's try it

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.049 
that means it's a level 5 let's try it
out<00:00:38.329> here<00:00:39.329> we<00:00:39.480> go

00:00:41.049 --> 00:00:41.059
