infections or antibiotics the problem
with<00:00:18.260> antibiotics<00:00:19.130> is<00:00:19.370> that<00:00:19.490> they<00:00:19.580> create<00:00:19.760> a

disruption in the good bacteria in the
body<00:00:23.000> and<00:00:23.420> that<00:00:23.480> can<00:00:24.230> weaken<00:00:24.500> your<00:00:24.560> immune

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:24.710 
body and that can weaken your immune

body and that can weaken your immune
system<00:00:25.400> and<00:00:25.520> actually<00:00:25.789> lead<00:00:25.940> to<00:00:25.970> more<00:00:26.390> urinary

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:26.869 
system and actually lead to more urinary

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:30.800 
tract infection is relatively

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.860 
tract infection is relatively
straightforward<00:00:31.300> what's<00:00:32.300> more<00:00:32.570> complicated

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:32.870 
straightforward what's more complicated

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:34.959 
straightforward what's more complicated
is<00:00:33.469> if<00:00:33.620> someone<00:00:33.920> gets<00:00:34.100> this<00:00:34.280> urinary<00:00:34.699> tract

00:00:34.959 --> 00:00:34.969 
is if someone gets this urinary tract

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:37.479 
is if someone gets this urinary tract
infection<00:00:35.629> chronically<00:00:36.589> and<00:00:36.800> then<00:00:36.920> we<00:00:37.039> really

00:00:37.479 --> 00:00:37.489 
infection chronically and then we really

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:39.099 
infection chronically and then we really
need<00:00:37.640> to<00:00:37.760> look<00:00:37.909> at<00:00:38.059> that<00:00:38.179> individual<00:00:38.870> and<00:00:38.989> see

00:00:39.099 --> 00:00:39.109 
need to look at that individual and see

00:00:39.109 --> 00:00:41.500 
need to look at that individual and see
why<00:00:39.620> and<00:00:40.039> answer<00:00:40.249> the<00:00:40.339> question<00:00:40.609> why<00:00:40.729> is<00:00:41.089> she

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:41.510 
why and answer the question why is she

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:43.569 
why and answer the question why is she
getting<00:00:41.690> it<00:00:41.899> repetitively<00:00:42.409> so<00:00:43.219> I<00:00:43.249> take<00:00:43.550> a

00:00:43.569 --> 00:00:43.579 
getting it repetitively so I take a

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:45.369 
getting it repetitively so I take a
comprehensive<00:00:44.030> history<00:00:44.659> to<00:00:44.780> figure<00:00:45.019> this<00:00:45.170> out

00:00:45.369 --> 00:00:45.379 
comprehensive history to figure this out

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:47.290 
comprehensive history to figure this out
and<00:00:45.649> look<00:00:45.829> for<00:00:45.859> any<00:00:46.280> triggers<00:00:46.940> like<00:00:47.269> a

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:47.300 
and look for any triggers like a

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.509 
and look for any triggers like a
weakened<00:00:47.659> immune<00:00:47.989> system<00:00:48.440> or<00:00:48.649> history<00:00:49.429> of

00:00:49.509 --> 00:00:49.519 
weakened immune system or history of

antibiotic use or possible food
sensitivities<00:00:52.940> or<00:00:53.420> if<00:00:54.109> they're<00:00:54.319> getting

spermicide all of which can contribute

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:06.719 
spermicide all of which can contribute
to<00:01:04.489> increased<00:01:05.030> urinary<00:01:05.299> tract<00:01:05.630> infections<00:01:06.350> I

00:01:06.719 --> 00:01:06.729 
to increased urinary tract infections I

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:10.510 
to increased urinary tract infections I
also<00:01:07.729> get<00:01:08.240> a<00:01:08.270> urine<00:01:08.659> sample<00:01:09.250> always<00:01:10.250> because

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:10.520 
also get a urine sample always because

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:11.859 
also get a urine sample always because
that<00:01:10.700> will<00:01:10.820> diagnose<00:01:11.180> if<00:01:11.329> there<00:01:11.450> actually<00:01:11.630> is

00:01:11.859 --> 00:01:11.869 
that will diagnose if there actually is

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:14.350 
that will diagnose if there actually is
indeed<00:01:12.409> a<00:01:12.439> urinary<00:01:12.950> tract<00:01:13.159> infection<00:01:13.189> so<00:01:14.149> in

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:14.360 
indeed a urinary tract infection so in

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.389 
indeed a urinary tract infection so in
the<00:01:14.509> urine<00:01:14.899> I'm<00:01:15.140> looking<00:01:15.710> for<00:01:15.890> signs<00:01:16.159> of

00:01:16.389 --> 00:01:16.399 
the urine I'm looking for signs of

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:19.090 
the urine I'm looking for signs of
infection<00:01:16.759> such<00:01:17.210> as<00:01:17.240> bacteria<00:01:17.770> white<00:01:18.770> blood

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:19.100 
infection such as bacteria white blood

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.149 
infection such as bacteria white blood
cells<00:01:19.399> elevated<00:01:20.180> leukocyte<00:01:20.659> esterase

nitrates<00:01:22.159> blood<00:01:22.759> and<00:01:23.119> if<00:01:23.659> those<00:01:23.840> are<00:01:23.899> positive

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:24.680 
nitrates blood and if those are positive

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.429 
nitrates blood and if those are positive
it<00:01:24.890> confirms<00:01:25.310> an<00:01:25.490> infection<00:01:26.090> and<00:01:26.329> I<00:01:26.960> send<00:01:27.259> out

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:27.439 
it confirms an infection and I send out

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:29.289 
it confirms an infection and I send out
the<00:01:27.619> urine<00:01:27.920> for<00:01:28.100> culture<00:01:28.130> and<00:01:28.579> sensitivity

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:29.299 
the urine for culture and sensitivity

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:31.450 
the urine for culture and sensitivity
which<00:01:29.450> takes<00:01:29.750> a<00:01:29.899> few<00:01:30.049> days<00:01:30.229> to<00:01:30.380> come<00:01:30.590> back<00:01:30.829> but

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:31.460 
which takes a few days to come back but

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:33.700 
which takes a few days to come back but
when<00:01:31.609> it<00:01:31.729> comes<00:01:31.880> back<00:01:32.149> I'll<00:01:32.539> know<00:01:33.140> what

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:33.710 
when it comes back I'll know what

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:35.950 
when it comes back I'll know what
bacteria<00:01:34.520> is<00:01:34.609> causing<00:01:35.060> the<00:01:35.179> infection<00:01:35.299> and

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:35.960 
bacteria is causing the infection and

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:37.870 
bacteria is causing the infection and
which<00:01:36.500> antibiotics<00:01:37.219> that<00:01:37.340> bacteria<00:01:37.820> is

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880 
which antibiotics that bacteria is

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.469 
which antibiotics that bacteria is
sensitive<00:01:38.420> to<00:01:38.630> that<00:01:39.350> so<00:01:39.829> in<00:01:39.950> the<00:01:40.270> unique<00:01:41.270> case

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:41.479 
sensitive to that so in the unique case

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:42.999 
sensitive to that so in the unique case
that<00:01:41.630> we<00:01:41.750> need<00:01:41.780> to<00:01:41.990> go<00:01:42.140> to<00:01:42.200> the<00:01:42.409> antibiotics

00:01:42.999 --> 00:01:43.009 
that we need to go to the antibiotics

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:45.520 
that we need to go to the antibiotics
will<00:01:43.189> know<00:01:43.429> the<00:01:43.609> most<00:01:43.820> appropriate<00:01:44.119> one<00:01:44.659> it's

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:45.530 
will know the most appropriate one it's

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:47.739 
will know the most appropriate one it's
also<00:01:45.710> important<00:01:46.310> to<00:01:46.369> rule<00:01:46.729> out<00:01:46.909> fever<00:01:47.270> or

00:01:47.739 --> 00:01:47.749 
also important to rule out fever or

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:49.749 
also important to rule out fever or
tenderness<00:01:48.439> where<00:01:48.770> the<00:01:48.890> kidneys<00:01:49.249> are<00:01:49.280> because

00:01:49.749 --> 00:01:49.759 
tenderness where the kidneys are because

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:52.300 
tenderness where the kidneys are because
that<00:01:49.939> could<00:01:50.119> be<00:01:50.240> a<00:01:50.270> sign<00:01:50.600> of<00:01:50.810> kidney<00:01:51.770> infection

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 
that could be a sign of kidney infection

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:54.880 
that could be a sign of kidney infection
which<00:01:52.520> would<00:01:52.700> require<00:01:53.259> more<00:01:54.259> laboratory

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:54.890 
which would require more laboratory

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.910 
which would require more laboratory
tests<00:01:55.249> a<00:01:55.609> and<00:01:55.969> more<00:01:56.299> aggressive<00:01:56.689> treatment<00:01:57.170> so

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920 
tests a and more aggressive treatment so

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.380 
tests a and more aggressive treatment so
my<00:01:58.070> treatment<00:01:58.609> for<00:01:58.819> urinary<00:01:59.060> tract

urinary tract infections and it binds to
the<00:02:52.639> e.coli<00:02:52.970> so<00:02:53.389> we<00:02:53.480> just<00:02:53.690> flush<00:02:54.019> it<00:02:54.049> out<00:02:54.349> so

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
the e.coli so we just flush it out so

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.770 
the e.coli so we just flush it out so
the<00:02:54.680> coli<00:02:54.920> can't<00:02:55.280> bind<00:02:55.519> to<00:02:55.700> the<00:02:55.790> bladder<00:02:56.060> and<00:02:56.389> I
