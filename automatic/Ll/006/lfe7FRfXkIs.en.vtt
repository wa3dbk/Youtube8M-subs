00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 hello everyone can swim very fast 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.299
 from the plain family I hope you 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.799
 Well, that's great, so we're 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:09.300
 found for a new episode of three 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:11.400
 things you do not know it's a 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.179
 peeled so I know it's really really 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.679
 a very long time that I had not done 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.389
 of episodes simply because I 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.379
 had no more ideas so I explain in 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.850
 group that it's for the new 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.350
 arriving so I just play 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.970
 I present to you three things that the 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.650
 most people do not know about the 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.910
 playstation 3 no we will see once I 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.740
 apologize for the other platforms of 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.359
 video games I called 3 I'm doing 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.730
 things on then you go in 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:32.640
 settings for the first thing you 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.469
 go into system settings you have 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.390
 already a little bit to get to 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.579
 notification messages and you have 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.500
 marked do not display while it was 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.360
 when marc do not display then this is 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.250
 very simple as see on the screen 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.300
 so appear basically when you 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.860
 often see at the top right of your 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.160
 screen marked trick well log in 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.020
 line 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.660
 Well it will avoid to see it precisely 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.579
 but the little point that is a pity 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.960
 is that at the same time it removes when 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.699
 we receive a message so you will not see 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.170
 plus also when you receive 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.430
 messages but hey it's still 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.899
 always useful so here you are doing 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.039
 as you want me I plug it but 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.939
 here we go after we find ourselves 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:08.280
 third thing then second thing that 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.780
 you did not know maybe so know 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.760
 you can have themes 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.189
 free for ps3 then everything 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.380
 just how are you going on your 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:19.850
 ordi you go on google so you 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:22.170
 have marked a free theme 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:24.150
 ts three years all in capital is 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.680
 shame it's okay I'll take 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.150
 the 1st here is the parent up to 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.490
 this is me a little mistake is 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.079
 not serious I will download so 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.970
 any theme so on the site 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:34.890
 that you want me so I downloaded 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.600
 him I already downloaded could 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.500
 wasting time so he's there so 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.180
 fight to download it you 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.100
 put on your desk you do a 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.530
 right click makes you new you create 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.060
 a new folder you call ps3 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.710
 all uppercase 1 all uppercase 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.390
 it's very important that if not the wound 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.990
 is simply will not read your 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.030
 USB key 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.439
 so after you go to the folder 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.079
 you right click makes you new 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:56.640
 folder and this you call it theme 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:58.680
 all uppercase if we do not know if you 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.820
 do not put it anyway I got you 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.700
 do not put in capitals simply 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.780
 the head we will not deny you will read it 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.700
 not and so you will not be able to put 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.789
 your wallpaper once you have that 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.440
 you slip it in 

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:12.090
 after that we take his record ps3 and 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:15.269
 we slip it into a 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:17.220
 usb key so here I'm extracting the key 

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:20.040
 usb and once we did that we go 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:24.989
 simply put the usb key on the 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:25.230
 ps3 this is third and last small 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:27.989
 thing 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.950
 so when we put music will be ps3 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:30.450
 so how do you do for me from the 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.620
 music is very simple it's the same 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.720
 that themes you put your usb key 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:36.180
 will be told you take your music you 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.560
 put your usb key on the ps3 and a 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.450
 Once you go to music 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.819
 you have found your adventures usb 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:43.349
 you will press x on it and there it 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:44.970
 will have noticed no tracks present 

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:46.890
 so do not worry, it's normal 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.730
 a bug what to do is based on 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:50.040
 triangle when you are on your 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.360
 adventures usb and you'll score 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.680
 displayed everything is so there you go 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:56.430
 to fall on all your records 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:58.590
 so if I'm sure they are already 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.879
 engage on my ps3 so I do not see 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:01.470
 but suddenly you found all your 

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:03.720
 music and after it will appear 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:04.680
 just down like mine is 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.180
 what you can do so we go 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:09.150
 take a gossip music to take 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:10.079
 this is what ex karim mosta you 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.660
 go you can press the button 

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:14.819
 ps of your ps3 and that will take us to 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:15.959
 menu car if you press round all 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:16.620
 just that will stop the music and 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:19.500
 return to the menu 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:20.639
 if you press your ps button you 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.290
 will be able in your menu the music 

00:03:20.639 --> 00:03:23.609
 will continue to rotate and you will 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.030
 do what you need to do in your 

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:25.680
 menu 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:28.010
 So that's it's a hiatus chip in 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:30.120
 more so if not I hope that 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:32.940
 how to say I hope it will have you 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:34.349

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.000
