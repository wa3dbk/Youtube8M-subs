as<00:02:09.000> i'm<00:02:09.149> recording<00:02:09.239> this<00:02:09.569> right<00:02:09.810> now<00:02:10.019> I'm

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
as i'm recording this right now I'm

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.110 
as i'm recording this right now I'm
trying<00:02:10.860> to<00:02:10.979> figure<00:02:11.160> out<00:02:11.400> if<00:02:11.489> there's<00:02:11.580> a<00:02:11.700> turbo

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
trying to figure out if there's a turbo

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.460 
trying to figure out if there's a turbo
button<00:02:12.450> or<00:02:12.569> something<00:02:12.720> because<00:02:12.989> I<00:02:13.140> just

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
button or something because I just

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.290 
button or something because I just
finished<00:02:13.920> playing<00:02:14.099> through<00:02:14.459> prototype<00:02:14.970> yeah

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
finished playing through prototype yeah

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.000 
finished playing through prototype yeah
and<00:02:15.480> I<00:02:15.510> felt<00:02:15.690> so<00:02:15.930> slow<00:02:16.319> running<00:02:16.650> through<00:02:16.890> this

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
and I felt so slow running through this

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:18.800 
and I felt so slow running through this
game<00:02:17.280> I<00:02:17.610> was<00:02:18.030> like<00:02:18.150> I<00:02:18.390> got<00:02:18.569> to<00:02:18.660> be<00:02:18.720> doing

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
game I was like I got to be doing

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.630 
game I was like I got to be doing
something<00:02:18.959> wrong<00:02:19.379> so<00:02:19.769> before<00:02:19.950> this<00:02:20.370> I<00:02:20.580> was

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
something wrong so before this I was

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.490 
something wrong so before this I was
checking<00:02:20.970> all<00:02:21.180> the<00:02:21.330> controller<00:02:22.200> settings

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
checking all the controller settings

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:23.809 
checking all the controller settings
making<00:02:22.950> sure<00:02:23.069> i<00:02:23.129> wasn't<00:02:23.310> forgetting

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
making sure i wasn't forgetting

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:27.080 
making sure i wasn't forgetting
something<00:02:24.269> yeah<00:02:24.989> but<00:02:25.650> no<00:02:26.519> I'm<00:02:26.760> going<00:02:26.910> as<00:02:27.060> fast

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
something yeah but no I'm going as fast

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.619 
something yeah but no I'm going as fast
as<00:02:27.420> I<00:02:27.540> can<00:02:27.599> there's<00:02:28.019> no<00:02:28.170> sprint<00:02:28.620> button<00:02:29.629> well

00:02:30.619 --> 00:02:30.629 
as I can there's no sprint button well

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:34.460 
as I can there's no sprint button well
yeah<00:02:32.510> it's<00:02:33.510> a<00:02:33.540> much<00:02:33.720> slower<00:02:33.959> game<00:02:34.290> in

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
yeah it's a much slower game in

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.619 
yeah it's a much slower game in
prototype<00:02:34.830> it<00:02:35.220> is<00:02:35.340> a<00:02:35.370> much<00:02:35.610> slower<00:02:35.849> game<00:02:36.150> but

00:02:36.619 --> 00:02:36.629 
prototype it is a much slower game but

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:40.100 
prototype it is a much slower game but
it's<00:02:37.170> kind<00:02:37.440> of<00:02:37.470> like<00:02:37.590> oh<00:02:38.959> what's<00:02:39.959> a<00:02:40.019> good

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
it's kind of like oh what's a good

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.130 
it's kind of like oh what's a good
comparison<00:02:40.590> like<00:02:41.810> warming<00:02:42.810> up<00:02:42.959> in<00:02:43.110> the

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
comparison like warming up in the

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:44.900 
comparison like warming up in the
batter's<00:02:43.530> box<00:02:43.680> with<00:02:43.950> a<00:02:44.010> donut<00:02:44.489> on<00:02:44.519> the<00:02:44.670> bat

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
batter's box with a donut on the bat

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:46.729 
batter's box with a donut on the bat
mm-hmm<00:02:45.780> and<00:02:45.989> then<00:02:46.170> when<00:02:46.260> you<00:02:46.319> get<00:02:46.440> up<00:02:46.560> to<00:02:46.650> the

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:46.739 
mm-hmm and then when you get up to the

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:49.160 
mm-hmm and then when you get up to the
plate<00:02:46.980> he<00:02:47.160> swings<00:02:47.519> so<00:02:47.819> much<00:02:47.940> faster<00:02:48.209> yeah<00:02:48.930> and

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
plate he swings so much faster yeah and

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:50.809 
plate he swings so much faster yeah and
then<00:02:49.410> you<00:02:49.470> put<00:02:49.590> the<00:02:49.650> donut<00:02:50.040> back<00:02:50.190> on<00:02:50.400> and<00:02:50.760> you

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:50.819 
then you put the donut back on and you

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:53.030 
then you put the donut back on and you
feel<00:02:51.060> like<00:02:51.090> it's<00:02:51.630> a<00:02:51.720> million<00:02:52.140> pounds<00:02:52.349> yeah

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
feel like it's a million pounds yeah

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350 
don't know prototype is like super

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:30.050 
don't know prototype is like super
simple<00:03:28.709> to<00:03:28.769> just<00:03:28.889> do<00:03:29.190> all<00:03:29.370> sorts<00:03:29.700> of<00:03:29.790> crazy

better though infamous looks a lot
better<00:04:08.040> than<00:04:08.280> prototype

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:09.020 
better than prototype

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:12.870 
better than prototype
did<00:04:09.830> you<00:04:09.950> play<00:04:10.130> both<00:04:10.400> in<00:04:10.670> HD<00:04:11.360> or<00:04:11.570> SD<00:04:11.600> I<00:04:12.260> played

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:12.880 
did you play both in HD or SD I played

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:19.780 
did you play both in HD or SD I played
both<00:04:13.880> in<00:04:14.120> SD<00:04:16.060> so<00:04:17.060> you<00:04:17.120> have<00:04:17.989> equal<00:04:18.620> basis<00:04:19.610> for

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:19.790 
both in SD so you have equal basis for

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:24.010 
both in SD so you have equal basis for
comparison<00:04:19.910> right<00:04:20.900> single<00:04:21.260> TV<00:04:21.880> hmm<00:04:22.930> maybe<00:04:23.930> not

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:24.020 
comparison right single TV hmm maybe not

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:27.640 
comparison right single TV hmm maybe not
it<00:04:24.760> ok<00:04:25.760> I<00:04:25.940> think<00:04:26.300> infamous<00:04:26.630> looks<00:04:26.900> better<00:04:27.110> but

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:27.650 
it ok I think infamous looks better but

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:30.010 
it ok I think infamous looks better but
it's<00:04:27.800> not<00:04:27.860> necessarily<00:04:28.490> like<00:04:28.850> you<00:04:29.570> know<00:04:29.660> the

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:30.020 
it's not necessarily like you know the

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:32.020 
it's not necessarily like you know the
polygon<00:04:30.590> count<00:04:30.920> that<00:04:31.130> makes<00:04:31.340> infamous<00:04:31.850> look

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:32.030 
polygon count that makes infamous look

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:33.490 
polygon count that makes infamous look
better<00:04:32.330> it's<00:04:32.570> the<00:04:32.750> detail<00:04:33.200> in<00:04:33.440> the

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:33.500 
better it's the detail in the

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:36.450 
better it's the detail in the
environment<00:04:33.800> that<00:04:34.070> the<00:04:34.250> art<00:04:34.690> right<00:04:35.690> well<00:04:35.960> like

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:36.460 
environment that the art right well like

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:38.560 
environment that the art right well like
running<00:04:37.460> up<00:04:37.550> the<00:04:37.670> side<00:04:37.820> of<00:04:37.880> a<00:04:38.030> building<00:04:38.060> in

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:38.570 
running up the side of a building in

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:41.710 
running up the side of a building in
prototype<00:04:39.160> you<00:04:40.160> like<00:04:40.700> it's<00:04:40.910> super<00:04:41.240> repetitive

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:41.720 
prototype you like it's super repetitive

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:44.110 
prototype you like it's super repetitive
it's<00:04:41.870> the<00:04:42.020> same<00:04:42.290> square<00:04:42.800> boring<00:04:43.310> flat<00:04:43.640> windows

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:44.120 
it's the same square boring flat windows

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:46.630 
it's the same square boring flat windows
over<00:04:44.510> and<00:04:44.630> over<00:04:44.750> again<00:04:44.990> where<00:04:45.800> every<00:04:46.040> inch<00:04:46.280> of

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:46.640 
over and over again where every inch of

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:50.580 
over and over again where every inch of
the<00:04:46.880> city<00:04:47.300> and<00:04:47.510> infamous<00:04:47.990> is<00:04:49.000> super<00:04:50.000> detailed

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:50.590 
the city and infamous is super detailed

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:53.860 
the city and infamous is super detailed
but<00:04:51.590> then<00:04:51.800> it's<00:04:52.730> kind<00:04:53.000> of<00:04:53.060> boring<00:04:53.270> to<00:04:53.480> climb<00:04:53.840> up

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:53.870 
but then it's kind of boring to climb up

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:55.570 
but then it's kind of boring to climb up
the<00:04:54.110> same<00:04:54.320> building<00:04:54.680> over<00:04:54.890> and<00:04:55.010> over<00:04:55.100> again<00:04:55.310> an

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:55.580 
the same building over and over again an

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:57.280 
the same building over and over again an
infamous<00:04:56.030> when<00:04:56.300> in<00:04:56.480> prototype<00:04:56.930> you<00:04:57.020> can<00:04:57.140> just

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:57.290 
infamous when in prototype you can just

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:59.140 
infamous when in prototype you can just
sprint<00:04:58.010> up<00:04:58.160> the<00:04:58.310> side<00:04:58.520> of<00:04:58.550> a<00:04:58.700> building<00:04:58.730> you

00:04:59.140 --> 00:04:59.150 
sprint up the side of a building you

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:05.090 
sprint up the side of a building you
still<00:04:59.540> flying<00:04:59.810> up<00:05:01.240> hmm
