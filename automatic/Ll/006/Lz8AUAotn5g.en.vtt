00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
off I mean it wasn't totally silent

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.030 
off I mean it wasn't totally silent
because<00:01:06.180> his<00:01:06.930> muffler<00:01:07.200> wasn't<00:01:07.710> working

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
because his muffler wasn't working

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.490 
because his muffler wasn't working
either<00:01:08.280> they<00:01:09.060> do<00:01:09.540> is<00:01:09.659> that<00:01:09.810> it<00:01:10.020> was<00:01:10.140> really

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
either they do is that it was really

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.280 
either they do is that it was really
loud<00:01:10.710> actually<00:01:11.400> and<00:01:12.390> when<00:01:12.810> you're<00:01:12.930> not<00:01:13.080> a

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
loud actually and when you're not a

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.109 
loud actually and when you're not a
child<00:01:13.590> anymore<00:01:13.860> it<00:01:14.460> doesn't<00:01:14.520> even<00:01:14.850> make<00:01:15.060> sense

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
child anymore it doesn't even make sense

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.870 
child anymore it doesn't even make sense
to<00:01:15.450> have<00:01:15.540> a<00:01:15.600> mini<00:01:15.780> man<00:01:15.990> because<00:01:16.580> minivans<00:01:17.580> are

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
to have a mini man because minivans are

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.630 
to have a mini man because minivans are
not<00:01:18.090> built<00:01:18.540> for<00:01:19.259> full-sized<00:01:19.799> people<00:01:20.280> you<00:01:20.549> know

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
it's actually kind of amazing how

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.670 
it's actually kind of amazing how
they're<00:01:22.470> somehow<00:01:23.369> both<00:01:24.350> incredibly<00:01:25.350> cramped

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
they're somehow both incredibly cramped

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.030

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.249 
at the same time so fat looking this is
my<00:01:31.590> impression<00:01:31.740> of<00:01:32.340> a<00:01:33.030> van<00:01:33.420> if<00:01:33.750> it<00:01:34.049> were<00:01:34.229> a

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
my impression of a van if it were a

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
anything in there it's basically the

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.289 
anything in there it's basically the
opposite<00:01:40.799> of<00:01:40.920> a<00:01:41.009> clown<00:01:41.220> car<00:01:41.490> after<00:01:42.060> school

power<00:02:18.470> stopped<00:02:19.470> working<00:02:19.950> for<00:02:20.670> the<00:02:20.760> most<00:02:20.970> part

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
power stopped working for the most part

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:23.270 
power stopped working for the most part
our<00:02:21.660> van<00:02:21.870> was<00:02:22.050> basically<00:02:22.440> one<00:02:22.710> piece<00:02:22.920> of<00:02:23.070> sheet

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
our van was basically one piece of sheet

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:24.680 
our van was basically one piece of sheet
metal<00:02:23.460> away<00:02:23.790> from<00:02:24.030> being<00:02:24.150> a<00:02:24.300> horse-drawn

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
metal away from being a horse-drawn

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:28.070 
metal away from being a horse-drawn
carriage<00:02:24.810> but<00:02:25.530> without<00:02:25.710> the<00:02:25.860> horse<00:02:26.930> here<00:02:27.930> I

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
carriage but without the horse here I

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.830 
carriage but without the horse here I
mean<00:02:28.290> I<00:02:28.320> don't<00:02:28.500> honestly<00:02:29.460> even<00:02:29.670> know<00:02:29.970> what<00:02:30.540> the

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
mean I don't honestly even know what the

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.720 
mean I don't honestly even know what the
car<00:02:31.020> companies<00:02:31.440> were<00:02:31.590> thinking<00:02:32.010> when<00:02:32.640> they

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
car companies were thinking when they

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.280 
car companies were thinking when they
decided<00:02:33.090> that<00:02:33.210> making<00:02:33.570> a<00:02:33.630> minivan<00:02:33.870> would<00:02:34.110> be<00:02:34.260> a

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
decided that making a minivan would be a

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:35.990 
decided that making a minivan would be a
good<00:02:34.470> idea<00:02:34.590> all<00:02:35.190> right<00:02:35.310> I<00:02:35.340> got<00:02:35.550> this<00:02:35.640> new<00:02:35.850> idea

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
good idea all right I got this new idea

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.510 
good idea all right I got this new idea
for<00:02:36.180> a<00:02:36.420> vehicle<00:02:36.870> you<00:02:37.470> know<00:02:37.590> how<00:02:37.800> people<00:02:38.040> love

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520 
for a vehicle you know how people love

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.820 
for a vehicle you know how people love
buses<00:02:39.450> well<00:02:39.960> I<00:02:39.990> was<00:02:40.230> thinking<00:02:40.500> that<00:02:40.530> we<00:02:40.710> could

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
buses well I was thinking that we could

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:42.560 
buses well I was thinking that we could
make<00:02:40.980> it<00:02:41.100> smaller<00:02:41.520> but<00:02:41.940> with<00:02:42.120> even<00:02:42.270> less

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:42.570 
make it smaller but with even less

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:44.390 
make it smaller but with even less
legroom<00:02:42.990> yeah<00:02:43.470> we'll<00:02:43.710> have<00:02:43.800> a<00:02:43.860> door<00:02:44.100> on<00:02:44.130> one

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
legroom yeah we'll have a door on one

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.700 
legroom yeah we'll have a door on one
side<00:02:44.640> terrible<00:02:45.360> gas<00:02:45.540> mileage<00:02:45.570> no<00:02:46.290> turning

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:46.710 
side terrible gas mileage no turning

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:48.680 
side terrible gas mileage no turning
radius<00:02:47.070> yeah<00:02:47.670> I<00:02:47.700> think<00:02:48.000> it'll<00:02:48.120> do<00:02:48.240> a<00:02:48.270> great<00:02:48.510> job

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
radius yeah I think it'll do a great job

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.530 
radius yeah I think it'll do a great job
ruining<00:02:49.080> a<00:02:49.140> lot<00:02:49.260> of<00:02:49.380> teenagers<00:02:49.650> lives<00:02:50.540> and

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
ruining a lot of teenagers lives and

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.000 
ruining a lot of teenagers lives and
what<00:02:51.750> one<00:02:51.990> last<00:02:52.230> thing<00:02:52.500> I'm<00:02:52.680> just<00:02:52.800> kind<00:02:52.980> of

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
what one last thing I'm just kind of

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:53.900 
what one last thing I'm just kind of
thinking<00:02:53.310> out<00:02:53.370> loud<00:02:53.430> here

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
thinking out loud here

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:57.140 
thinking out loud here
is<00:02:54.690> there<00:02:55.560> a<00:02:55.590> way<00:02:55.860> that<00:02:56.310> we<00:02:56.430> can<00:02:56.610> engineer<00:02:57.000> it

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
is there a way that we can engineer it

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.270 
is there a way that we can engineer it
so<00:02:57.300> that<00:02:57.480> it<00:02:57.600> only<00:02:57.780> breaks<00:02:58.200> down<00:02:58.500> at<00:02:58.920> times

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
so that it only breaks down at times

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:04.460 
so that it only breaks down at times
when<00:02:59.490> it<00:02:59.610> would<00:02:59.670> be<00:02:59.730> most<00:03:00.000> embarrassing

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:06.530 

you
