even get shots and we'll lose the game
at<00:02:55.480> least<00:02:55.630> today<00:02:55.780> we<00:02:56.380> had<00:02:56.530> a<00:02:56.560> lot<00:02:56.800> of<00:02:56.830> shots<00:02:57.070> we

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
at least today we had a lot of shots we

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:58.470 
at least today we had a lot of shots we
just<00:02:57.430> didn't<00:02:57.640> take<00:02:57.790> them<00:02:58.000> and<00:02:58.120> if<00:02:58.209> we<00:02:58.330> had<00:02:58.450> a

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 
just didn't take them and if we had a

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.600 
just didn't take them and if we had a
clinical<00:02:58.989> strike<00:02:59.230> as<00:02:59.470> I<00:02:59.650> said<00:02:59.860> I<00:03:00.010> think<00:03:00.250> we

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:00.610 
clinical strike as I said I think we

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:01.920 
clinical strike as I said I think we
would<00:03:00.730> have<00:03:00.760> taken<00:03:00.970> an<00:03:01.209> order<00:03:01.480> one<00:03:01.660> that<00:03:01.810> came

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
would have taken an order one that came

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:03.479 
would have taken an order one that came
pretty<00:03:02.230> easily<00:03:02.500> I<00:03:02.860> think<00:03:03.100> it's<00:03:03.190> the<00:03:03.250> first

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:03.489 
pretty easily I think it's the first

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:04.949 
pretty easily I think it's the first
time<00:03:03.610> I've<00:03:03.760> witnessed<00:03:03.940> penalties<00:03:04.570> when<00:03:04.840> I've

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:04.959 
time I've witnessed penalties when I've

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:06.150 
time I've witnessed penalties when I've
been<00:03:05.080> watching<00:03:05.350> a<00:03:05.380> nice<00:03:05.530> with<00:03:05.709> him<00:03:05.860> I<00:03:06.010> think

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.160 
been watching a nice with him I think

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.130 
been watching a nice with him I think
the<00:03:06.220> last<00:03:06.310> time<00:03:06.430> was<00:03:06.610> in<00:03:06.730> 2009<00:03:07.420> in<00:03:07.660> Italy<00:03:08.110> I

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
the last time was in 2009 in Italy I

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:09.900 
the last time was in 2009 in Italy I
think<00:03:08.440> they<00:03:08.530> commentator<00:03:08.980> said<00:03:09.190> I'm<00:03:09.610> watching

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:09.910 
think they commentator said I'm watching

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:12.720 
think they commentator said I'm watching

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730 
that this was very intense because we

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:14.460 
that this was very intense because we

took them luckily shesnew was in very
good<00:03:33.850> form<00:03:34.150> basically<00:03:34.299> every<00:03:34.780> penalty<00:03:35.290> that

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:35.500 
good form basically every penalty that

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:38.160 
good form basically every penalty that
he<00:03:35.890> had<00:03:35.980> to<00:03:36.100> defend<00:03:36.610> he<00:03:37.330> picked<00:03:37.600> the<00:03:37.780> right<00:03:37.930> way

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:38.170 
he had to defend he picked the right way

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:39.900 
he had to defend he picked the right way
apart<00:03:38.650> from<00:03:38.799> once<00:03:39.100> i<00:03:39.250> think<00:03:39.280> it<00:03:39.519> was<00:03:39.610> but<00:03:39.820> every

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:39.910 
apart from once i think it was but every

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:41.220 
apart from once i think it was but every
other<00:03:40.060> time<00:03:40.299> I<00:03:40.330> picked<00:03:40.540> the<00:03:40.630> wrong<00:03:40.780> way<00:03:40.959> there

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:41.230 
other time I picked the wrong way there

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:42.870 
other time I picked the wrong way there
was<00:03:41.320> a<00:03:41.380> couple<00:03:41.500> times<00:03:41.890> that<00:03:42.100> he<00:03:42.400> got<00:03:42.489> hands<00:03:42.730> to

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:42.880 
was a couple times that he got hands to

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:44.400 
was a couple times that he got hands to
her<00:03:42.970> but<00:03:43.180> it<00:03:43.269> was<00:03:43.360> just<00:03:43.390> too<00:03:43.630> powerful<00:03:43.959> though

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:44.410 
her but it was just too powerful though

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:46.110 
her but it was just too powerful though
very<00:03:44.709> confident<00:03:45.250> going<00:03:45.340> into<00:03:45.579> the<00:03:45.760> penalties

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120 
very confident going into the penalties

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:47.520 
very confident going into the penalties
and<00:03:46.660> that's<00:03:46.840> why<00:03:46.959> I<00:03:46.989> was<00:03:47.079> very<00:03:47.260> worried

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:47.530 
and that's why I was very worried

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:48.810 
and that's why I was very worried
because<00:03:47.620> they<00:03:47.920> just<00:03:48.100> had<00:03:48.400> the<00:03:48.489> confidence

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:48.820 
because they just had the confidence

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:50.910 
because they just had the confidence
flowing<00:03:49.540> they<00:03:50.049> knew<00:03:50.290> that<00:03:50.350> they<00:03:50.650> would<00:03:50.769> that

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:50.920 
flowing they knew that they would that

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:52.560 
flowing they knew that they would that
close<00:03:51.160> to<00:03:51.340> win<00:03:51.489> they<00:03:51.790> were<00:03:51.850> just<00:03:51.970> smash<00:03:52.269> every

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:52.570

league<00:04:29.580> team<00:04:29.820> we<00:04:29.970> filled<00:04:30.180> it<00:04:30.330> almost<00:04:30.690> our

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:30.900 
league team we filled it almost our

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:33.470 
league team we filled it almost our
first<00:04:31.860> team<00:04:32.220> the<00:04:32.670> best<00:04:32.700> team<00:04:32.940> that<00:04:33.180> we<00:04:33.270> have

it's<00:04:34.200> disappointing<00:04:36.530> we<00:04:37.530> have<00:04:37.650> to<00:04:37.770> move<00:04:37.920> on

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:38.070 
it's disappointing we have to move on

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:39.650 
it's disappointing we have to move on
now<00:04:38.280> though<00:04:38.520> we<00:04:38.700> can't<00:04:38.940> dwell<00:04:39.120> on<00:04:39.270> this<00:04:39.450> too

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:39.660 
now though we can't dwell on this too

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:41.630 
now though we can't dwell on this too
much<00:04:39.870> hopefully<00:04:40.140> the<00:04:40.500> place<00:04:40.710> don't<00:04:41.100> because<00:04:41.520> I

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:41.640 
much hopefully the place don't because I

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:43.670 
much hopefully the place don't because I
thought<00:04:41.850> after<00:04:42.120> you<00:04:42.930> know<00:04:43.050> getting<00:04:43.350> the<00:04:43.500> win

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:43.680 
thought after you know getting the win

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:45.560 
thought after you know getting the win
on<00:04:43.920> the<00:04:44.250> weekend<00:04:44.610> that<00:04:44.730> we<00:04:44.850> would<00:04:45.030> slowly<00:04:45.300> get

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:45.570 
on the weekend that we would slowly get

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:46.970 
on the weekend that we would slowly get
some<00:04:45.720> momentum<00:04:45.840> even<00:04:46.350> if<00:04:46.440> it<00:04:46.560> was<00:04:46.680> from<00:04:46.830> two

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:46.980 
some momentum even if it was from two

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:48.830 
some momentum even if it was from two
penalties<00:04:47.340> but<00:04:47.460> that's<00:04:47.640> not<00:04:47.760> to<00:04:47.910> be<00:04:48.060> we've<00:04:48.690> got

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:48.840 
penalties but that's not to be we've got

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:50.780 
penalties but that's not to be we've got
reading<00:04:49.140> on<00:04:49.230> Monday<00:04:49.560> so<00:04:49.620> hopefully<00:04:50.520> we<00:04:50.640> can

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:50.790 
reading on Monday so hopefully we can

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:52.490 
reading on Monday so hopefully we can
feel<00:04:50.970> the<00:04:51.240> basically<00:04:51.720> the<00:04:51.810> same<00:04:51.990> team<00:04:52.260> may<00:04:52.440> be

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:52.500 
feel the basically the same team may be

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:54.440 
feel the basically the same team may be
a<00:04:52.620> few<00:04:52.800> changes<00:04:52.830> here<00:04:53.400> I<00:04:53.730> wouldn't<00:04:54.210> start

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:57.810 
Rams it was because resist he would do a

00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:59.030
