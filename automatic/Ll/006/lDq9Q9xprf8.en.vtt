curls that you know lasts pretty
decently<00:01:58.709> another<00:01:59.709> thing<00:02:00.069> is<00:02:00.459> that<00:02:00.899> they<00:02:01.899> both

00:02:02.129 --> 00:02:02.139 
decently another thing is that they both

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.080 
pretty flat so this one fits better

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.650 
pretty flat so this one fits better
whereas<00:02:47.620> I<00:02:47.980> have<00:02:48.370> a<00:02:48.430> friend<00:02:48.760> her<00:02:49.120> eyes<00:02:49.330> had

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:49.660 
whereas I have a friend her eyes had

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:52.890 
whereas I have a friend her eyes had
more<00:02:49.959> I<00:02:50.799> guess<00:02:51.489> like<00:02:51.670> the<00:02:51.790> eyeball<00:02:52.180> it<00:02:52.390> like

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
more I guess like the eyeball it like

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:56.490 
more I guess like the eyeball it like
pops<00:02:53.200> out<00:02:53.470> a<00:02:53.500> little<00:02:53.739> bit<00:02:53.920> more<00:02:54.190> so<00:02:55.030> the<00:02:56.019> Shadle

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
pops out a little bit more so the Shadle

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.970 
pops out a little bit more so the Shadle
one<00:02:56.650> is<00:02:56.799> better<00:02:57.010> for<00:02:57.250> her<00:02:57.810> so<00:02:58.810> if<00:02:59.019> I<00:02:59.260> use<00:02:59.739> this

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:21.400 
know when I use shadow one I end up

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.820 
know when I use shadow one I end up
saying<00:04:21.579> these<00:04:21.880> ones<00:04:22.150> here<00:04:22.540> okay<00:04:23.320> so<00:04:23.350> I<00:04:23.560> got

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:23.830 
saying these ones here okay so I got

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:25.830 
saying these ones here okay so I got
this<00:04:24.009> one<00:04:24.250> to<00:04:24.370> kind<00:04:24.490> of<00:04:24.610> do<00:04:24.759> that<00:04:24.970> but<00:04:25.660> then

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:25.840 
this one to kind of do that but then

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:27.870 
this one to kind of do that but then
after<00:04:26.169> I<00:04:26.229> got<00:04:26.410> a<00:04:26.440> shoe<00:04:26.710> mara<00:04:26.979> once<00:04:27.280> so<00:04:27.550> I<00:04:27.580> didn't

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:27.880 
after I got a shoe mara once so I didn't

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:29.370 
after I got a shoe mara once so I didn't
I<00:04:28.000> don't<00:04:28.270> really<00:04:28.389> need<00:04:28.570> this<00:04:28.720> anymore<00:04:28.960> and

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:29.380 
I don't really need this anymore and

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:31.830 
I don't really need this anymore and
this<00:04:29.889> one<00:04:30.160> this<00:04:30.370> mini<00:04:30.639> one<00:04:30.820> is<00:04:31.000> just<00:04:31.270> a<00:04:31.389> small

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:31.840 
this one this mini one is just a small

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:34.610 
this one this mini one is just a small
little<00:04:32.110> flat<00:04:32.710> shape<00:04:33.370> one<00:04:33.610> there's<00:04:33.820> no<00:04:34.000> curve

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:34.620 
little flat shape one there's no curve

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:36.689 
little flat shape one there's no curve
hardly<00:04:35.620> okay

00:04:36.689 --> 00:04:36.699 
hardly okay

00:04:36.699 --> 00:04:40.170 
hardly okay
and<00:04:37.060> I<00:04:37.750> think<00:04:37.810> elf<00:04:38.530> has<00:04:39.009> these<00:04:39.669> little<00:04:39.970> mini

and I think elf has these little mini

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:42.990 
and I think elf has these little mini
lash<00:04:40.479> curlers<00:04:40.960> too<00:04:41.229> and<00:04:41.590> since<00:04:42.400> there<00:04:42.699> is<00:04:42.820> no

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:43.000 
lash curlers too and since there is no

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.840 
lash curlers too and since there is no
like<00:04:43.419> shape<00:04:43.780> to<00:04:44.020> it<00:04:44.050> or<00:04:44.259> anything<00:04:44.470> I<00:04:44.919> really

like shape to it or anything I really

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:48.140 
like shape to it or anything I really
don't<00:04:46.240> see<00:04:46.300> why<00:04:46.600> you<00:04:47.020> would<00:04:47.139> want<00:04:47.320> to<00:04:47.380> spend

small<00:05:17.440> tiny<00:05:17.710> one<00:05:17.979> so<00:05:18.250> this<00:05:18.430> one<00:05:18.669> fits<00:05:19.030> in<00:05:19.210> there

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:55.620 
lash curlers like rochedo and Shu Uemura
they<00:05:53.470> do<00:05:53.530> cost<00:05:53.949> you<00:05:54.460> know<00:05:54.580> a<00:05:54.610> bit<00:05:54.940> more<00:05:54.970> quite<00:05:55.599> a

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:55.630 
they do cost you know a bit more quite a

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:58.620 
they do cost you know a bit more quite a

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:01.360 
think it's worth it because it just

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:04.140 
think it's worth it because it just
makes<00:06:01.659> your<00:06:01.870> job<00:06:02.560> of<00:06:02.800> curling<00:06:03.190> lashes<00:06:03.400> so<00:06:03.940> much

makes your job of curling lashes so much
more<00:06:04.570> it's<00:06:05.260> it's<00:06:05.770> so<00:06:06.099> much<00:06:06.159> more<00:06:06.490> efficient<00:06:07.030> to

00:06:07.649 --> 00:06:07.659 
more it's it's so much more efficient to

00:06:07.659 --> 00:06:10.379 
more it's it's so much more efficient to
have<00:06:07.690> one<00:06:08.139> of<00:06:08.260> these<00:06:08.380> okay<00:06:09.250> but<00:06:09.550> you<00:06:10.030> know<00:06:10.150> do
