of a mesh that's going to be breathable

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:16.720 
of a mesh that's going to be breathable
it's<00:02:15.379> also<00:02:15.500> going<00:02:15.680> to<00:02:15.770> be<00:02:16.160> moisture<00:02:16.580> wicking

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
it's also going to be moisture wicking

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:18.190 
it's also going to be moisture wicking
