00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
it's not a very good attack but when

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.590 
it's not a very good attack but when
diddy<00:01:47.220> kong<00:01:47.460> does<00:01:47.759> his<00:01:47.880> little<00:01:48.000> cart

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:38.930 
camera kind of goes to the right you

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:41.350 
camera kind of goes to the right you
need<00:04:39.140> a<00:04:39.170> bunch<00:04:39.410> of<00:04:39.530> empty<00:04:39.830> space<00:04:40.130> over<00:04:41.090> on<00:04:41.210> the
