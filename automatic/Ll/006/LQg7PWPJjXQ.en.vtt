00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:07.040 
for princesses in my heart a lot of

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.250 
for princesses in my heart a lot of

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.010 
times in fairytales the leading
character<00:01:09.830> is<00:01:10.159> a<00:01:10.640> little<00:01:11.060> more<00:01:11.210> reactive

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.020 
character is a little more reactive

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:13.630 
character is a little more reactive
things<00:01:12.620> happen<00:01:13.040> to<00:01:13.190> them

things happen to them

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.480 
things happen to them
and<00:01:13.850> they<00:01:14.090> just<00:01:14.270> kind<00:01:14.450> of<00:01:14.680> but<00:01:15.680> with<00:01:15.890> Tiana<00:01:16.220> and

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:16.490 
and they just kind of but with Tiana and

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:18.820 
and they just kind of but with Tiana and
some<00:01:16.790> of<00:01:16.909> our<00:01:17.030> other<00:01:17.150> leading<00:01:17.659> ladies<00:01:18.409> they

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:18.830 
some of our other leading ladies they

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:21.399 
some of our other leading ladies they
were<00:01:18.890> more<00:01:19.190> proactive<00:01:19.940> in<00:01:20.060> the<00:01:20.840> decisions

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:21.409 
were more proactive in the decisions

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:23.560 
were more proactive in the decisions
that<00:01:21.500> they<00:01:21.740> make<00:01:21.770> propel<00:01:22.700> the<00:01:22.880> story<00:01:23.180> forward

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:23.570 
that they make propel the story forward

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:26.140 
that they make propel the story forward
and<00:01:23.990> I<00:01:24.290> think<00:01:24.320> Tiana<00:01:24.830> is<00:01:25.010> another<00:01:25.370> classic

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:26.150 
and I think Tiana is another classic

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:27.880 
and I think Tiana is another classic
example<00:01:26.240> of<00:01:26.750> that<00:01:26.810> she's<00:01:27.350> a<00:01:27.409> very<00:01:27.590> strong

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:27.890 
example of that she's a very strong

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:31.060 
example of that she's a very strong
character<00:01:28.370> definitely<00:01:29.030> has<00:01:29.659> direction<00:01:30.440> and<00:01:30.920> a

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:31.070 
character definitely has direction and a

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.660 
character definitely has direction and a
drive<00:01:31.430> she's<00:01:32.360> not<00:01:33.110> gonna<00:01:33.320> let<00:01:33.590> anything<00:01:34.250> stand

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:34.670 
drive she's not gonna let anything stand

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:35.170 
drive she's not gonna let anything stand
in<00:01:34.850> her<00:01:34.970> way
