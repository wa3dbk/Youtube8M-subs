wide narrow compared to the previous
ones<00:02:01.290> I<00:02:01.469> would<00:02:01.619> say<00:02:01.770> it's<00:02:01.950> 50%<00:02:02.310> of<00:02:03.000> what<00:02:03.540> that

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
ones I would say it's 50% of what that

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.670 
ones I would say it's 50% of what that
was<00:02:04.250> same<00:02:05.250> mechanism<00:02:05.850> in<00:02:06.060> which<00:02:06.119> you<00:02:06.420> push<00:02:06.689> to

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
was same mechanism in which you push to

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.130 
was same mechanism in which you push to
open<00:02:07.979> up<00:02:08.129> and<00:02:08.580> over<00:02:09.030> here<00:02:09.479> that<00:02:09.929> little

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
open up and over here that little

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.040 
open up and over here that little

the<00:02:13.170> shifters<00:02:13.620> will<00:02:14.040> go<00:02:14.280> in<00:02:16.100> so<00:02:17.330> what<00:02:18.330> they<00:02:18.540> say

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
the shifters will go in so what they say

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.580 
the shifters will go in so what they say
was<00:02:19.140> that<00:02:19.820> with<00:02:20.820> this<00:02:21.030> redesigned<00:02:21.690> master

you're<00:02:26.430> supposed<00:02:26.820> to<00:02:26.940> get<00:02:27.120> better<00:02:29.150> modulation

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
you're supposed to get better modulation

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.680 
you're supposed to get better modulation
and<00:02:30.750> better<00:02:31.230> fuel<00:02:31.560> of<00:02:31.710> the<00:02:31.860> brake<00:02:32.070> I<00:02:32.420> will<00:02:33.420> let

you<00:02:33.840> know<00:02:34.020> how<00:02:34.290> that<00:02:34.560> goes<00:02:34.800> but<00:02:35.340> I<00:02:35.580> definitely

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:35.820 
you know how that goes but I definitely

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:39.440 
you know how that goes but I definitely
like<00:02:36.090> the<00:02:36.510> look<00:02:36.900> of<00:02:37.050> it<00:02:37.200> this<00:02:37.860> is<00:02:37.920> not<00:02:38.550> black

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
like the look of it this is not black

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:45.170 
like the look of it this is not black
black<00:02:40.020> is<00:02:40.410> a<00:02:40.760> dark<00:02:41.760> grey<00:02:42.480> black<00:02:43.400> but<00:02:44.400> again<00:02:44.850> I

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
black is a dark grey black but again I

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.170 
black is a dark grey black but again I
still<00:02:45.540> prefer<00:02:45.720> to<00:02:46.260> the<00:02:46.470> shiny<00:02:46.800> chrome<00:02:47.180> caliper

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
still prefer to the shiny chrome caliper

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:52.270 
still prefer to the shiny chrome caliper
as<00:02:49.020> you<00:02:49.140> can<00:02:49.350> see<00:02:49.650> these<00:02:49.980> are<00:02:50.430> this<00:02:51.090> came<00:02:51.360> with

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
as you can see these are this came with

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.870 
as you can see these are this came with
regular<00:02:53.280> resin<00:02:53.670> pad<00:02:53.880> pads<00:02:54.360> not<00:02:54.810> the<00:02:55.020> fan<00:02:55.320> ones

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:55.880 
regular resin pad pads not the fan ones

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.880 
regular resin pad pads not the fan ones
it<00:02:56.880> looks<00:02:57.090> to<00:02:57.300> me<00:02:57.330> to<00:02:57.750> be<00:02:57.840> very<00:02:57.960> similar<00:02:58.470> to<00:02:58.770> the

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
it looks to me to be very similar to the

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:01.250 
it looks to me to be very similar to the
previous<00:02:59.040> generation<00:02:59.270> you<00:03:00.270> have<00:03:00.450> this<00:03:00.690> banjo

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
previous generation you have this banjo

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.530 
previous generation you have this banjo
connector<00:03:01.950> here<00:03:02.160> so<00:03:02.910> you<00:03:03.000> can<00:03:03.120> change<00:03:03.330> the

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
connector here so you can change the

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.870 
connector here so you can change the
angle<00:03:03.960> of<00:03:04.050> the<00:03:04.110> hose<00:03:04.410> coming<00:03:04.800> out<00:03:04.920> of<00:03:05.070> the

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
angle of the hose coming out of the

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:13.450 
angle of the hose coming out of the
caliper<00:03:07.370> the<00:03:08.370> bleeding<00:03:08.820> port<00:03:09.810> is<00:03:10.050> here<00:03:11.750> okay

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:13.460 
caliper the bleeding port is here okay

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:19.670 
caliper the bleeding port is here okay
and<00:03:14.460> it<00:03:15.300> seems<00:03:15.660> to<00:03:15.750> use<00:03:16.080> the<00:03:16.410> same<00:03:17.270> pen<00:03:18.270> the<00:03:19.260> pad

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
and it seems to use the same pen the pad

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.010 
and it seems to use the same pen the pad
retaining<00:03:20.220> pin<00:03:20.430> seems<00:03:20.850> to<00:03:21.000> be<00:03:21.150> identical<00:03:21.810> to

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:22.020 
retaining pin seems to be identical to

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:24.590 
retaining pin seems to be identical to
the<00:03:22.230> previous<00:03:22.380> generation<00:03:23.060> let<00:03:24.060> me<00:03:24.180> take<00:03:24.570> that

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:24.600 
the previous generation let me take that

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:30.229 
the previous generation let me take that
out<00:03:24.840> so<00:03:26.000> pad<00:03:27.000> retaining<00:03:27.830> pin<00:03:28.830> the<00:03:29.790> on<00:03:29.940> screw

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239 
out so pad retaining pin the on screw

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:32.090 
out so pad retaining pin the on screw
down<00:03:30.390> with<00:03:30.660> a<00:03:30.780> three<00:03:31.110> millimeter<00:03:31.380> allen<00:03:31.800> key

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:32.100 
down with a three millimeter allen key

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:34.940 
down with a three millimeter allen key
as<00:03:33.060> soon<00:03:33.270> as<00:03:33.390> you<00:03:33.480> take<00:03:33.690> that<00:03:33.870> out<00:03:34.050> this<00:03:34.290> pad

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
as soon as you take that out this pad

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:39.920 
as soon as you take that out this pad
spacer<00:03:35.700> comes<00:03:35.910> out<00:03:36.470> I'm<00:03:37.470> going<00:03:37.680> to<00:03:37.970> pass<00:03:39.000> now

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
spacer comes out I'm going to pass now

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:42.560 
spacer comes out I'm going to pass now
the<00:03:40.350> paths<00:03:40.680> for<00:03:41.220> this<00:03:41.400> new<00:03:41.580> generation<00:03:42.060> have

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:42.570 
the paths for this new generation have

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:49.340 
the paths for this new generation have
new<00:03:42.810> codes<00:03:43.170> I<00:03:44.180> think<00:03:45.180> they<00:03:45.330> are<00:03:46.550> g0<00:03:47.550> to<00:03:47.760> a<00:03:48.350> J

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:49.350 
new codes I think they are g0 to a J

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:52.490 
new codes I think they are g0 to a J
zero<00:03:50.040> to<00:03:50.100> a<00:03:50.330> those<00:03:51.330> are<00:03:51.570> resin<00:03:51.989> both<00:03:52.170> of<00:03:52.350> them

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
zero to a those are resin both of them

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.810 
zero to a those are resin both of them
and<00:03:52.709> then<00:03:53.040> you<00:03:53.130> have<00:03:53.280> G<00:03:53.730> as<00:03:53.850> in<00:03:54.030> George<00:03:54.380> 0:44<00:03:55.380> s

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:55.820 
and then you have G as in George 0:44 s

00:03:55.820 --> 00:04:01.400 
and then you have G as in George 0:44 s
and<00:03:56.820> J<00:03:57.600> 0<00:03:58.080> for<00:03:58.410> c<00:03:58.920> metal<00:03:59.720> alright<00:04:00.720> so<00:04:01.140> what<00:04:01.290> do<00:04:01.350> I

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:01.410 
and J 0 for c metal alright so what do I

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:06.140 
and J 0 for c metal alright so what do I
have<00:04:01.590> here<00:04:01.860> this<00:04:02.220> is<00:04:02.280> the<00:04:02.760> G<00:04:03.239> 0<00:04:03.660> to<00:04:03.989> a<00:04:04.880> resin<00:04:05.880> pad

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
have here this is the G 0 to a resin pad

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:10.100 
have here this is the G 0 to a resin pad
and<00:04:06.540> which<00:04:07.520> right<00:04:08.520> off<00:04:08.640> the<00:04:08.790> bat<00:04:08.970> looks<00:04:09.360> like<00:04:09.600> a

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:10.110 
and which right off the bat looks like a

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:14.120 
and which right off the bat looks like a
clear<00:04:11.010> aluminum<00:04:12.000> color<00:04:12.620> these<00:04:13.620> are<00:04:13.680> resin

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:14.130 
clear aluminum color these are resin

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:17.300 
clear aluminum color these are resin
pads<00:04:14.340> the<00:04:15.090> older<00:04:15.450> ones<00:04:15.660> look<00:04:16.049> a<00:04:16.169> lot<00:04:16.440> but<00:04:16.980> aside

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310 
pads the older ones look a lot but aside

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:19.789 
pads the older ones look a lot but aside
from<00:04:17.370> that<00:04:17.549> one<00:04:17.970> I<00:04:18.239> think<00:04:19.080> this<00:04:19.440> is<00:04:19.620> exactly

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 
from that one I think this is exactly

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:24.230 
from that one I think this is exactly
the<00:04:20.340> same<00:04:20.609> size<00:04:22.610> let<00:04:23.610> me<00:04:23.700> see<00:04:23.850> if<00:04:23.940> I<00:04:24.060> can

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.240 
the same size let me see if I can

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:25.720 
the same size let me see if I can
install<00:04:24.690> one<00:04:24.990> of<00:04:25.050> the<00:04:25.289> older

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:25.730 
install one of the older

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:29.650 
install one of the older
that's<00:04:25.850> just<00:04:26.120> I'm<00:04:26.300> just<00:04:26.330> curious<00:04:27.460> okay<00:04:28.660> so

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:29.660 
that's just I'm just curious okay so

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:32.410 
that's just I'm just curious okay so
what<00:04:29.840> I<00:04:29.870> have<00:04:30.110> here<00:04:30.140> is<00:04:31.000> one<00:04:32.000> of<00:04:32.030> the<00:04:32.240> good<00:04:32.390> old

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:32.420 
what I have here is one of the good old

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:36.270 
what I have here is one of the good old
or<00:04:33.290> not<00:04:34.130> all<00:04:34.340> the<00:04:34.640> previous<00:04:35.000> generation<00:04:35.630> pads

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:36.280 
or not all the previous generation pads

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:40.630 
or not all the previous generation pads
this<00:04:37.280> is<00:04:37.490> the<00:04:37.640> fins<00:04:38.000> resin<00:04:39.130> and<00:04:40.130> the<00:04:40.370> code<00:04:40.610> for

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:40.640 
this is the fins resin and the code for

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:44.950 
this is the fins resin and the code for
this<00:04:40.970> one<00:04:41.030> is<00:04:41.650> f01<00:04:42.650> a<00:04:42.880> resin<00:04:43.880> pad<00:04:44.090> that<00:04:44.750> is

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:44.960 
this one is f01 a resin pad that is

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:47.580 
this one is f01 a resin pad that is
definitely<00:04:45.380> not<00:04:45.440> listed<00:04:45.980> in<00:04:46.100> the<00:04:46.160> in<00:04:46.730> the

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:47.590 
definitely not listed in the in the

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:50.620 
definitely not listed in the in the
available<00:04:48.590> pads<00:04:48.830> for<00:04:49.190> the<00:04:49.250> new<00:04:49.490> x<00:04:49.670> DS<00:04:49.940> but<00:04:50.390> as

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:50.630 
available pads for the new x DS but as

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:53.410 
available pads for the new x DS but as
you<00:04:50.930> can<00:04:51.110> see<00:04:51.170> fits<00:04:51.860> right<00:04:52.130> in<00:04:52.340> and<00:04:52.640> I'm<00:04:53.150> sure

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:53.420 
you can see fits right in and I'm sure

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:58.150 
you can see fits right in and I'm sure
it's<00:04:53.720> absolutely<00:04:53.930> the<00:04:54.230> same<00:04:54.610> so<00:04:56.680> you<00:04:57.680> take<00:04:57.920> if

00:04:58.150 --> 00:04:58.160 
it's absolutely the same so you take if

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.460 
it's absolutely the same so you take if
you<00:04:58.310> opened<00:04:58.610> the<00:04:59.360> box<00:04:59.390> if<00:04:59.990> there<00:05:00.140> was<00:05:00.230> anything

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:00.470 
you opened the box if there was anything

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:03.280 
you opened the box if there was anything
different<00:05:01.370> in<00:05:01.430> there<00:05:01.460> oh<00:05:01.820> yeah<00:05:02.780> I<00:05:02.900> think<00:05:03.080> the

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:03.290 
different in there oh yeah I think the

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:05.440 
different in there oh yeah I think the
only<00:05:03.440> difference<00:05:03.620> or<00:05:04.430> the<00:05:04.580> rear<00:05:04.760> break<00:05:05.030> and

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:05.450 
only difference or the rear break and

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:06.760 
only difference or the rear break and
you<00:05:05.720> can<00:05:05.840> see<00:05:06.170> it<00:05:06.290> here

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:06.770 
you can see it here

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:11.290
