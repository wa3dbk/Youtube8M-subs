00:01:35.499 --> 00:01:35.509 
going to need to do is connect that part

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:37.969 
going to need to do is connect that part
to<00:01:36.509> the<00:01:36.600> underside<00:01:37.079> of<00:01:37.110> the<00:01:37.229> leg<00:01:37.380> first<00:01:37.650> you

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
to the underside of the leg first you

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.080 
to the underside of the leg first you
want<00:01:38.100> to<00:01:38.189> give<00:01:38.280> it<00:01:38.340> about<00:01:38.400> a<00:01:38.490> half<00:01:38.700> a<00:01:38.880> turn

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
want to give it about a half a turn

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.630 
want to give it about a half a turn
because<00:01:39.479> as<00:01:39.659> this<00:01:40.170> gets<00:01:40.530> closer<00:01:40.829> to<00:01:41.009> the<00:01:41.220> two

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
because as this gets closer to the two

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.490 
because as this gets closer to the two
down<00:01:42.030> plate<00:01:42.360> it<00:01:42.750> will<00:01:42.899> expand<00:01:44.060> take<00:01:45.060> that

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:45.500 
down plate it will expand take that
