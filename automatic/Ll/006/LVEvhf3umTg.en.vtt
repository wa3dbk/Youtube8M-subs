exactly<00:01:22.110> like<00:01:22.350> titanfall<00:01:22.680> is<00:01:22.890> where<00:01:23.009> you'll

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
exactly like titanfall is where you'll

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.230 
exactly like titanfall is where you'll

still prevalent when playing the other

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:39.459 
game modes - when the humans attacks

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:41.190 
game modes - when the humans attacks
were<00:02:39.549> destroying<00:02:39.880> nests<00:02:40.180> or<00:02:40.390> rescuing<00:02:40.750> humans

were destroying nests or rescuing humans

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:42.600 
were destroying nests or rescuing humans
the<00:02:41.500> monsters<00:02:41.829> still<00:02:41.980> trying<00:02:42.280> to<00:02:42.340> reach<00:02:42.489> his

the monsters still trying to reach his

the monsters still trying to reach his
final<00:02:42.910> form<00:02:43.120> like<00:02:43.299> Frieza

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
final form like Frieza

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:44.819 
final form like Frieza
so<00:02:43.900> they<00:02:43.989> can<00:02:44.140> mess<00:02:44.290> up<00:02:44.440> their<00:02:44.590> plans

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:44.829 
so they can mess up their plans

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:46.559 
so they can mess up their plans
ultimately<00:02:45.610> this<00:02:45.849> means<00:02:45.910> that<00:02:46.180> the<00:02:46.269> game<00:02:46.450> can

00:02:46.559 --> 00:02:46.569 
ultimately this means that the game can

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:48.509 
ultimately this means that the game can
become<00:02:46.870> boring<00:02:47.200> very<00:02:47.769> quickly<00:02:48.099> because

00:02:48.509 --> 00:02:48.519 
become boring very quickly because

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:50.640 
become boring very quickly because
that's<00:02:48.790> basically<00:02:48.970> one<00:02:49.540> game-mode<00:02:50.079> with<00:02:50.470> some

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650 
that's basically one game-mode with some

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:52.740 
that's basically one game-mode with some
slight<00:02:50.920> variations<00:02:51.549> mind<00:02:51.849> you<00:02:51.970> this<00:02:52.060> is<00:02:52.209> a<00:02:52.239> $60

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:52.750

I'm talking about you'll be waiting

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:46.470 
I'm talking about you'll be waiting
anywhere<00:03:45.010> from<00:03:45.220> 10<00:03:45.519> to<00:03:45.549> 15<00:03:45.880> minutes<00:03:46.389> on

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:46.480 
anywhere from 10 to 15 minutes on

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.180 
anywhere from 10 to 15 minutes on
average<00:03:46.690> to<00:03:46.900> load<00:03:47.139> into<00:03:47.260> a<00:03:47.349> game<00:03:47.620> which<00:03:48.010> is

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:48.190 
average to load into a game which is

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:49.800 
average to load into a game which is
just<00:03:48.370> unacceptable<00:03:48.730> especially<00:03:49.690> because

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:49.810 
just unacceptable especially because

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:51.509 
just unacceptable especially because
most<00:03:50.139> the<00:03:50.200> time<00:03:50.410> you're<00:03:50.590> put<00:03:50.769> on<00:03:50.950> a<00:03:50.980> terrible

00:03:51.509 --> 00:03:51.519 
most the time you're put on a terrible

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:53.550 
most the time you're put on a terrible
team<00:03:51.760> but<00:03:52.180> I<00:03:52.209> think<00:03:52.510> this<00:03:52.660> games<00:03:52.989> biggest

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:53.560 
team but I think this games biggest

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:55.530 
team but I think this games biggest
issue<00:03:53.799> is<00:03:54.340> the<00:03:54.430> lack<00:03:54.730> of<00:03:54.760> content<00:03:55.209> and

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:55.540 
issue is the lack of content and

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:57.479 
issue is the lack of content and
variation<00:03:56.109> you<00:03:56.440> can<00:03:56.470> play<00:03:56.739> this<00:03:56.889> game<00:03:56.950> for<00:03:57.310> one

00:03:57.479 --> 00:03:57.489 
variation you can play this game for one

00:03:57.489 --> 00:03:58.860 
variation you can play this game for one
hour<00:03:57.700> and<00:03:58.030> you'll<00:03:58.209> seem<00:03:58.450> pretty<00:03:58.690> much

everything that you need to see in the

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:01.740 
everything that you need to see in the

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:20.450 
the game there's a solid foundation here

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:22.180 
the game there's a solid foundation here
but<00:04:20.660> ultimately<00:04:21.109> this<00:04:21.290> game<00:04:21.500> falls<00:04:21.859> on<00:04:22.040> its

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:22.190 
but ultimately this game falls on its

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:24.070 
but ultimately this game falls on its
face<00:04:22.250> because<00:04:22.730> of<00:04:22.850> the<00:04:22.910> lack<00:04:23.090> of<00:04:23.120> content<00:04:23.750> it's

face because of the lack of content it's

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:25.659 
face because of the lack of content it's
just<00:04:24.350> not<00:04:24.530> enough<00:04:24.770> variation<00:04:25.400> here<00:04:25.520> to

00:04:25.659 --> 00:04:25.669 
just not enough variation here to

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:27.879 
just not enough variation here to
justify<00:04:26.120> a<00:04:26.150> $60<00:04:26.720> purchase<00:04:27.230> that's<00:04:27.560> probably

justify a $60 purchase that's probably

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:29.409 
justify a $60 purchase that's probably
