00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:07.440 
hi my name is Laurie and I'm going to

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.650 
hi my name is Laurie and I'm going to
show<00:00:07.620> you<00:00:07.680> how<00:00:08.069> to<00:00:08.130> build<00:00:08.519> range<00:00:08.970> on<00:00:09.389> the

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
show you how to build range on the

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.290 
show you how to build range on the
French<00:00:09.900> horn<00:00:10.139> today<00:00:10.500> now<00:00:11.340> most<00:00:11.670> horn<00:00:12.000> players

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
French horn today now most horn players

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.720 
French horn today now most horn players
struggle<00:00:12.870> with<00:00:13.019> their<00:00:13.200> upper<00:00:13.650> range<00:00:13.920> more<00:00:14.429> so

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
struggle with their upper range more so

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.210 
struggle with their upper range more so
than<00:00:14.969> the<00:00:15.120> lower<00:00:15.470> I'm<00:00:16.470> going<00:00:16.740> to<00:00:16.800> show<00:00:16.980> you<00:00:17.039> a

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
than the lower I'm going to show you a

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.140 
than the lower I'm going to show you a
couple<00:00:17.520> of<00:00:17.699> exercises<00:00:18.090> for<00:00:18.539> both<00:00:19.080> problems

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:20.150 
couple of exercises for both problems

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:22.609 
couple of exercises for both problems
this<00:00:21.150> was<00:00:21.420> an<00:00:21.630> exercise<00:00:21.930> that<00:00:22.320> one<00:00:22.439> of<00:00:22.529> my

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
this was an exercise that one of my

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.370 
this was an exercise that one of my
former<00:00:22.980> teachers<00:00:23.340> showed<00:00:23.670> me<00:00:23.910> and<00:00:24.240> I<00:00:25.019> think

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
former teachers showed me and I think

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.720 
former teachers showed me and I think
the<00:00:25.529> key<00:00:25.800> to<00:00:25.830> this<00:00:26.130> exercise<00:00:26.699> is<00:00:27.150> that<00:00:27.930> it<00:00:28.730> has

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
the key to this exercise is that it has

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.479 
the key to this exercise is that it has
enough<00:00:29.970> rest<00:00:31.160> incorporated<00:00:32.160> that<00:00:32.369> your

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
enough rest incorporated that your

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.630 
enough rest incorporated that your
armature<00:00:32.969> is<00:00:33.559> sort<00:00:34.559> of<00:00:34.649> tricked<00:00:35.010> into

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
armature is sort of tricked into

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.319 
armature is sort of tricked into
building<00:00:36.270> strength<00:00:37.309> by<00:00:38.309> the<00:00:38.370> regular<00:00:39.030> wrist

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
building strength by the regular wrist

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.479 
building strength by the regular wrist
so<00:00:39.840> let<00:00:40.079> me<00:00:40.170> show<00:00:40.350> you<00:00:40.410> a<00:00:40.500> little<00:00:40.559> bit<00:00:40.770> it<00:00:41.309> also

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
so let me show you a little bit it also

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.229 
so let me show you a little bit it also
has<00:00:41.940> some<00:00:42.210> lips<00:00:42.540> lers<00:00:42.899> and<00:00:43.820> I'll<00:00:44.820> just<00:00:45.030> do<00:00:45.210> a

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
has some lips lers and I'll just do a

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:46.790 
has some lips lers and I'll just do a
little<00:00:45.390> bit<00:00:45.629> and<00:00:45.809> then<00:00:45.930> kind<00:00:46.230> of<00:00:46.289> tell<00:00:46.500> you<00:00:46.649> how

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
little bit and then kind of tell you how

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:56.560 
little bit and then kind of tell you how
how<00:00:47.489> you<00:00:47.550> reach<00:00:47.879> your<00:00:48.059> goal<00:00:48.239> from<00:00:48.539> there

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:56.570 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:58.160

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.170 
you
move<00:00:59.170> the<00:00:59.410> horn<00:00:59.680> for<00:01:00.010> four<00:01:00.280> counts<00:01:00.789> and<00:01:01.000> then

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:01.180 
move the horn for four counts and then

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:06.720 
move the horn for four counts and then
start<00:01:01.449> on<00:01:01.570> the<00:01:01.690> upper<00:01:01.809> note

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:06.730 

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:10.980 

Oh

then<00:01:11.410> you<00:01:11.590> go<00:01:11.740> up<00:01:11.950> by<00:01:12.220> half<00:01:12.460> step<00:01:12.820> C<00:01:13.270> to<00:01:13.570> c-sharp

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:20.860 

you

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:20.870 
you

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:22.500 
you
Oh

Oh

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:34.480 
Oh
rest<00:01:23.380> for<00:01:23.500> 4<00:01:24.330> and<00:01:25.330> then<00:01:25.540> down<00:01:26.020> again

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:34.490 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:45.660 

up<00:01:35.490> a<00:01:35.640> half-step<00:01:35.960> C<00:01:36.960> to<00:01:37.020> c-sharp

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:45.670 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:49.180 

etc<00:01:46.670> now<00:01:47.660> this<00:01:48.170> may<00:01:48.350> not<00:01:48.560> sound<00:01:48.770> like<00:01:48.920> it's

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:49.190 
etc now this may not sound like it's

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:52.540 
etc now this may not sound like it's
going<00:01:49.370> to<00:01:49.430> do<00:01:49.700> much<00:01:49.940> but<00:01:50.690> you'll<00:01:51.020> be<00:01:51.080> up<00:01:51.920> pretty

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:52.550 
going to do much but you'll be up pretty

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:54.400 
going to do much but you'll be up pretty
high<00:01:52.880> before<00:01:53.360> you<00:01:53.480> know<00:01:53.660> it<00:01:53.840> and<00:01:54.020> because

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:54.410 
high before you know it and because

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:56.260 
high before you know it and because
you're<00:01:54.620> resting<00:01:55.160> for<00:01:55.400> those<00:01:55.520> four<00:01:55.790> counts<00:01:56.180> and

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.270 
you're resting for those four counts and

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:58.210 
you're resting for those four counts and
actually<00:01:56.720> removing<00:01:57.260> the<00:01:57.410> horn<00:01:57.680> from<00:01:57.980> the

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:58.220 
actually removing the horn from the

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:00.490 
actually removing the horn from the
armature<00:01:58.730> it<00:01:59.420> gives<00:01:59.750> you<00:01:59.960> a<00:01:59.990> chance<00:02:00.350> to

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:00.500 
armature it gives you a chance to

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.390 
armature it gives you a chance to
regenerate<00:02:01.720> I<00:02:02.720> would<00:02:03.320> highly<00:02:03.830> recommend<00:02:04.250> this

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:04.400 
regenerate I would highly recommend this

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.160 
regenerate I would highly recommend this
exercise<00:02:04.760> for<00:02:05.300> extending<00:02:05.780> your<00:02:05.900> upper

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.170 
exercise for extending your upper

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:09.160 
exercise for extending your upper
register<00:02:06.620> now<00:02:07.460> for<00:02:07.730> the<00:02:07.820> low<00:02:07.970> register<00:02:08.210> I'd

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
register now for the low register I'd

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:12.130 
register now for the low register I'd
like<00:02:09.380> to<00:02:09.530> show<00:02:09.770> you<00:02:09.800> a<00:02:09.979> book<00:02:10.460> called<00:02:11.330> armature

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
like to show you a book called armature

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.500 
like to show you a book called armature
building<00:02:12.770> and<00:02:13.010> there's<00:02:13.880> an<00:02:14.030> exercise

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
building and there's an exercise

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:17.050 
building and there's an exercise
specifically<00:02:15.140> in<00:02:15.440> here<00:02:15.830> for<00:02:16.190> extending<00:02:16.940> your

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
specifically in here for extending your

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.390 
specifically in here for extending your
register<00:02:17.540> down<00:02:18.080> and<00:02:18.560> I'm<00:02:19.010> going<00:02:19.130> to<00:02:19.190> do<00:02:19.370> a

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
register down and I'm going to do a

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.060 
register down and I'm going to do a
little<00:02:19.700> bit<00:02:19.880> of<00:02:19.970> that<00:02:20.120> for<00:02:20.450> you<00:02:20.570> too

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:21.070 
little bit of that for you too

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:23.890 
little bit of that for you too
unfortunately<00:02:22.070> this<00:02:22.370> will<00:02:23.240> take<00:02:23.450> a<00:02:23.480> lot<00:02:23.780> of

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
unfortunately this will take a lot of

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.950 
unfortunately this will take a lot of
repetition<00:02:24.730> but<00:02:25.730> is<00:02:25.910> already<00:02:26.210> helped<00:02:26.720> me

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:26.960 
repetition but is already helped me

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:29.460 
repetition but is already helped me
because<00:02:27.350> I<00:02:27.380> struggle<00:02:28.040> in<00:02:28.160> the<00:02:28.250> area<00:02:28.580> of<00:02:28.700> low

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
because I struggle in the area of low

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:33.700 
because I struggle in the area of low
you<00:02:31.000> start<00:02:32.000> on<00:02:32.150> middle<00:02:32.300> C<00:02:32.480> and<00:02:32.960> this<00:02:33.410> is<00:02:33.560> how

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:33.710 
you start on middle C and this is how

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:43.600 
you start on middle C and this is how
the<00:02:33.770> exercise<00:02:34.130> goes

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:43.610 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:53.670 

Oh

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.649 

okay<00:02:54.680> and<00:02:54.890> then<00:02:55.010> you<00:02:55.159> would<00:02:55.280> repeat<00:02:55.580> that<00:02:55.819> ten

00:02:56.649 --> 00:02:56.659 
okay and then you would repeat that ten

00:02:56.659 --> 00:02:59.229 
okay and then you would repeat that ten
times<00:02:57.159> alright<00:02:58.159> now<00:02:58.489> I<00:02:58.519> know<00:02:58.700> that's<00:02:58.909> a<00:02:59.090> lot

00:02:59.229 --> 00:02:59.239 
times alright now I know that's a lot

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:01.929 
times alright now I know that's a lot
then<00:02:59.900> you<00:03:00.110> would<00:03:00.260> start<00:03:00.560> half<00:03:00.980> step<00:03:01.280> lower<00:03:01.310> and

00:03:01.929 --> 00:03:01.939 
then you would start half step lower and

00:03:01.939 --> 00:03:04.780 
then you would start half step lower and
do<00:03:02.060> the<00:03:02.209> exact<00:03:02.540> same<00:03:02.870> pattern<00:03:03.200> again<00:03:03.739> kind<00:03:04.670> of

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790 
do the exact same pattern again kind of

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:07.149 
do the exact same pattern again kind of
