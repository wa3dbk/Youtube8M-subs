watching other people's videos it seems

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.580

the<00:00:55.800> munchies<00:00:55.980> are<00:00:56.399> really<00:00:56.610> snacky<00:00:57.149> or

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
the munchies are really snacky or

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.420 
the munchies are really snacky or
looking<00:00:57.809> around<00:00:57.989> so<00:00:58.379> this<00:00:58.530> isn't<00:00:58.829> a<00:00:58.949> snacking

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.029 
looking around so this isn't a snacking
video<00:00:59.699> necessarily<00:01:00.420> but<00:01:00.660> it<00:01:00.930> is<00:01:01.590> your

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
video necessarily but it is your

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.870 
video necessarily but it is your
favorite<00:01:02.760> grocery<00:01:03.300> items<00:01:03.870> video<00:01:04.229> so<00:01:05.129> it

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
favorite grocery items video so it

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:06.710 
favorite grocery items video so it
doesn't<00:01:06.119> have<00:01:06.210> to<00:01:06.270> be<00:01:06.299> something<00:01:06.420> that<00:01:06.600> you

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
get every week and it doesn't even have

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.920
