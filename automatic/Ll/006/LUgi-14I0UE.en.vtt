00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:23.960 
and a good way to get the seed out is

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.350 
and a good way to get the seed out is
just<00:01:24.259> get<00:01:24.590> it<00:01:24.710> with<00:01:24.860> a<00:01:24.890> knife<00:01:25.130> brings<00:01:25.970> it<00:01:26.149> right

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:26.360 
just get it with a knife brings it right

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:32.700

out

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:32.710 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:35.130 

so<00:01:33.370> depending<00:01:33.850> on<00:01:33.850> how<00:01:34.000> many<00:01:34.240> years<00:01:34.600> serving

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:35.140 
so depending on how many years serving

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:40.920 
so depending on how many years serving
will<00:01:35.350> determine<00:01:38.760> how<00:01:39.760> many<00:01:39.850> avocados<00:01:40.299> you

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:40.930

00:02:50.179 --> 00:02:50.189 
and I just use a fork and they should

00:02:50.189 --> 00:03:02.210 
and I just use a fork and they should
bash<00:02:50.459> up<00:02:50.819> very<00:02:51.209> very<00:02:51.299> easy<00:02:57.859> to<00:02:58.859> this<00:02:59.780> add<00:03:01.220> salt

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
bash up very very easy to this add salt
