00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:22.470 
bulbs aren't oh should probably check
the<00:02:20.620> fuse<00:02:20.860> box<00:02:20.920> okay<00:02:21.790> so<00:02:21.850> it<00:02:21.970> actually<00:02:22.120> turns

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
the fuse box okay so it actually turns

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.740 
the fuse box okay so it actually turns
out<00:02:22.780> that<00:02:23.580> these<00:02:24.580> light<00:02:24.790> bulbs<00:02:24.970> may<00:02:25.330> not<00:02:25.569> have

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
out that these light bulbs may not have

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.600 
out that these light bulbs may not have
been<00:02:25.840> bad<00:02:26.080> actually<00:02:26.620> had<00:02:26.709> a<00:02:26.739> blown<00:02:27.010> fuse

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
been bad actually had a blown fuse

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:29.490 
been bad actually had a blown fuse
so<00:02:28.390> let<00:02:28.540> me<00:02:28.630> show<00:02:28.780> you<00:02:28.870> where<00:02:29.019> the<00:02:29.110> fuse<00:02:29.350> is

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
so let me show you where the fuse is

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:35.790 
so let me show you where the fuse is
that<00:02:31.110> goes<00:02:32.110> over<00:02:32.440> here<00:02:34.260> okay<00:02:35.260> so<00:02:35.319> I<00:02:35.500> got<00:02:35.680> my

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:35.800 
that goes over here okay so I got my

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:40.170 
that goes over here okay so I got my
handy<00:02:36.100> dandy<00:02:36.130> light<00:02:36.610> here<00:02:38.010> the<00:02:39.010> fuse<00:02:39.760> for<00:02:39.790> the

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
handy dandy light here the fuse for the

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:46.440 
handy dandy light here the fuse for the
tail<00:02:40.630> is<00:02:43.440> this<00:02:44.519> 15<00:02:45.519> want<00:02:45.790> to<00:02:45.910> write<00:02:46.060> the<00:02:46.269> end

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
tail is this 15 want to write the end

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:53.840 
tail is this 15 want to write the end
here<00:02:47.549> so<00:02:48.840> this<00:02:49.840> fuse<00:02:51.690> that<00:02:52.690> fuse<00:02:53.140> right<00:02:53.350> there

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
here so this fuse that fuse right there

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:56.670 
here so this fuse that fuse right there
was<00:02:54.850> bad<00:02:55.060> so<00:02:55.480> I<00:02:55.540> replace<00:02:55.840> that<00:02:56.049> and<00:02:56.260> there<00:02:56.590> we

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
was bad so I replace that and there we

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:59.460 
was bad so I replace that and there we
go<00:02:57.239> all<00:02:58.239> right<00:02:58.390> so<00:02:58.569> next<00:02:58.750> step<00:02:59.049> now<00:02:59.260> I<00:02:59.290> know

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
go all right so next step now I know

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:03.630 
go all right so next step now I know
these<00:02:59.739> are<00:02:59.920> working<00:03:00.250> I'm<00:03:00.459> going<00:03:00.760> to<00:03:02.640> reinstall

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:03.640 
these are working I'm going to reinstall

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:10.640

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:13.979 

all<00:03:11.650> right<00:03:12.209> it's<00:03:13.209> kind<00:03:13.390> of<00:03:13.420> hard<00:03:13.599> to<00:03:13.659> show<00:03:13.930> you

00:03:13.979 --> 00:03:13.989 
all right it's kind of hard to show you

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:17.240 
all right it's kind of hard to show you
but<00:03:14.349> basically<00:03:15.209> you<00:03:16.209> want<00:03:16.239> to<00:03:16.510> take<00:03:16.750> this

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
but basically you want to take this

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:21.000 
but basically you want to take this
these<00:03:18.250> little<00:03:18.670> notches<00:03:19.239> here<00:03:19.860> go<00:03:20.860> in<00:03:20.920> the

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 
these little notches here go in the

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:22.619 
these little notches here go in the
large<00:03:21.220> holes<00:03:21.489> and<00:03:21.700> then<00:03:21.879> you<00:03:21.939> just<00:03:22.150> twist<00:03:22.360> it

00:03:22.619 --> 00:03:22.629 
large holes and then you just twist it

00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:26.610 
large holes and then you just twist it
clockwise<00:03:23.560> this<00:03:24.069> way<00:03:24.569> so<00:03:25.569> not<00:03:26.019> quite<00:03:26.290> sure<00:03:26.319> how

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620 
clockwise this way so not quite sure how

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:28.989 
I'm going to do this one because this

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:31.440 
I'm going to do this one because this
harness<00:03:29.260> here<00:03:29.620> just<00:03:30.610> doesn't<00:03:31.150> give<00:03:31.239> you<00:03:31.299> a<00:03:31.360> lot
