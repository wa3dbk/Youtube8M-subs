00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 a person in the channel told me that 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:07.500
 if it was possible to test a motherboard or 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:10.860
 mike board without hard drive here we are 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:15.059
 seeing this plate we will emulate here 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:19.020
 ok remember first we put the 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:21.529
 microprocessor in its socket we put 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.529
 grease 

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:27.789
 we are doing the protocol what the 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.339
 device for cooling 

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:33.399
 and we put it will stay like this 

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:37.170
 very important way the source of 

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:40.750
 food I recommend you leave it 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:44.680
 unplugged you put the video signal to 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:46.809
 the plate you put the keyboard signal not 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:50.199
 you need to put the mouse next 

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:51.699
 that is going to plug in is here the cable to 

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:55.449
 the plate the current we are going to give 

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:58.300
 current then we see that we do not have 

00:00:55.449 --> 00:00:59.740
 no plate of additional memory 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.080
 RAM 

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:04.260
 the battery has to be there, notice that 

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:07.710
 We have a hard drive right now 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.710
 we connect the monitor 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.710
 there is 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:22.740
 never on the monitor 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.990
 there it is on 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.350
 let's wait a little bit if they happen 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:30.180
 account is already working without a hard drive 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:32.520
 there the signal came in but we're already 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.470
 trying good says he did not find the 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.290
 operating system and in this way so 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:41.060
 easy so fast 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:43.560
 we can try a plate to know if 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:48.270
 has faults 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:51.070
 if it is damaged remember the battery has 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.550
 to be yes or yes the memory 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:57.450
 processor 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:02:00.120
 what is the dissipator with grease that 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.680
 is right now without a hard drive and is 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:05.310
 working 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.630
 they realized there we see it 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.200
 who tells me that he does not have the system 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.069
 operative 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.069
 and ready 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.450
 and there it is 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:21.090
 good friends I hope this video will 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.560
 has been quite helpful to all 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.069
 those people who want to try a 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.499
 license plate 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:29.409
 and know if it is damaged without a hard drive 

00:02:26.499 --> 00:02:33.239
 and without any component I hope that 

00:02:29.409 --> 00:02:33.239
 I liked this video and my friends
