00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:07.859
 Hello UTB psycho artur and today I 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:10.410
 I will tell you about the tank based on 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:13.799
 impression of a single battle 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:16.619
 Well, excuse me guys, it all happened 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.119
 and so it happened that judging on Churchill 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.180
 around most likely 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.740
 and probably so I will be about to ride 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.840
 only one more precisely already rolled 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:28.980
 one with you and no longer do 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:30.449
 I will and not because the tank is bad on this 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.790
 I'll stop a little bit now 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:36.390
 explain in more detail why why all 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.469
 why did it happen so strand 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.010
 and for me the statistics 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:45.300
 she's like a notebook in which I stick 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:47.399
 stickers and these stickers are tanks i 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.879
 carefully choose those stickers that I 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.620
 pasted 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.510
 actually in this album because 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.149
 I canâ€™t ruin them anymore 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.129
 This album if from heroes sloppy 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:59.160
 yes there good page then sticker you 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:02.550
 You understand if you are already stuck on 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.899
 paper is everything forever and more often 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.350
 it's just such a label me her 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:09.990
 donated one of my subscribers and so 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.270
 it turned out that she was rare so 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:16.140
 in one fight I took the master and a little more 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:18.570
 three thousand experiences of pure experience with prem 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.759
 well, this is probably quite correct clean 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.979
 experience is called the experience which 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.540
 right without any there to indicators but 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.759
 yet the experience that can 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.100
 show up in theory you like 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:31.110
 maximally stuffed it all the same 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:34.170
 It counts with a premium therefore but more 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.970
 3000 boys Churchill for one fight it 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:40.079
 I already then guys explained that 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:42.899
 turns on this tank the highest 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:45.210
 raid on indicators precisely earning 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:46.439
 I don't know how it happened 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:50.460
 that's how he got off balance 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:51.930
 that is, for the battle in the kat, let's say I 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.540
 would i have been getting on x celsius or 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.189
 for example in the British hard and this 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.990
 principle too British so 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:59.369
 they are not far from each other though on 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:03.509
 It is actually very far from them similar 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:05.549
 only the tower in general I did not get 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:07.920
 got into a fight about the same i have 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:09.210
 deal plus or minus only damage well 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.280
 fraga okay there was 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:13.770
 but still the fight was powerful there too 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.600
 I did not give so much experience that is 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:17.730
 Churchill in this is strong really if you 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:20.430
 need a tank that earns 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:22.290
 unreal mountain of experience here you are please 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:25.110
 see it now on your screen 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.040
 Churchill what else is interesting and 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:28.140
 outstanding 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.930
 I always thought that this is a pukalka 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.970
 cane best implements itself on and 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:37.260
 st-shki so at one time I opened 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:39.210
 imagine what kind of a cruiser on it 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.800
 pumped that is fully weapon 

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:42.900
 she shoots there a little longer than 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.370
 here on churchill on I thought it was 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.260
 an instrument well, still on the adequacy 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.330
 looks like something like a heavy duty 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:50.820
 dumb well here's a bunch a bunch a bunch somehow 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:53.220
 sadly but now when i have 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:53.700
 driving experience of different tanks fifth 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:57.000
 level 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:58.680
 heavy namely from preferential premium i 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.050
 I want to tell you that this gun is better 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:03.630
 this is this gun in the best with me 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:06.230
 happened here on for while driving 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:10.380
 preferential ted again in our game this 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:12.690
 seriously very powerful weapon and most importantly 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:15.120
 his strength is that she is just 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:17.160
 monstrously punches on the head 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:19.200
 as much as 180 millimeters and pretty 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:22.410
 much as it turns out it punches on 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:24.630
 lip that is 110 breaking through kind of like 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:25.200
 it seems bullshit yes you have to shoot gold well 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:28.170
 nifiga 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:30.120
 it turns out this is a break through for preferential 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:33.150
 here it is 5 again underlined this 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:36.000
 that is quite enough to farm 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:37.890
 well really enough for it now i see 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.460
 Golodets loaded on and you know why because 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:43.740
 what I felt I just smelled a 

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:46.590
 So he's he's he's he's the master here 

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:48.810
 he is a record of experience and not to let him down 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:51.750
 I have 110 breakthroughs to avoid 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:53.520
 some kind of rebound there any there 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:55.710
 here it is now so that I do not have it just 

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:57.960
 leveled out among the gold you look what 

00:03:55.710 --> 00:04:00.660
 and created just became and here I am 

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:02.940
 pedestal deer take me let me 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:05.820
 stupidly fire opponents understand how 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:08.310
 I am superior to all the tanks that 

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:09.960
 stayed on the battlefield I have a blink 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:13.140
 some kind of screens in the side of the brush 

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:15.270
 huge bushes have such an awesome 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:16.950
 square frontal armor 

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:20.130
 Well, that is, in my forehead, I am all 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:22.740
 armored tank for a rally well you 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:25.110
 Saw yes all this gif I just everyone 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:27.330
 broke that is here went into battle of all 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:30.000
 torn out of battle in this is my experience 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:31.920
 driving churchill and what can i get you 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.380
 say yes he is slow he is very 

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:37.440
 slowest slowest year this again 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:39.390
 really the slowest 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:41.820
 playing it a lot is probably difficult 

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:45.200
 because of this but the gun drags 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:49.290
 This fact and armor drags as it turned out 

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:52.020
 so I can even advise buying here 

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:54.090
 something like this well although I don't think that 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:57.030
 buying is preferential here it is five this big 

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:58.950
 an event that requires investigation by them 

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:02.280
 without knowing the study vidos so on 

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:05.280
 so this video is just to show 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:08.580
 what was serious about you? 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:11.010
 there is such an experience yes I got it and you 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:13.160
 he told him well and his parallel 

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:15.930
 opinion of this tank was also expressed 

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:17.730
 thanks for watching if this video is for you 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:19.800
