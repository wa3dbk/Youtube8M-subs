00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
going to go hardcore and it lasted three

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.269 
going to go hardcore and it lasted three
days<00:00:19.500> which<00:00:20.039> is<00:00:20.430> good<00:00:21.029> just<00:00:22.020> as<00:00:22.230> long<00:00:22.350> as<00:00:22.650> I<00:00:22.800> had

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
originally planned and that's because I

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.910

stinking thing and he just looks at us
masks<00:01:06.990> that's<00:01:07.200> why<00:01:07.409> he's<00:01:07.740> not<00:01:07.950> crying<00:01:08.310> and<00:01:08.869> why

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
masks that's why he's not crying and why

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.670 
masks that's why he's not crying and why
it<00:01:09.930> didn't<00:01:10.350> hurt<00:01:10.650> and<00:01:11.479> kind<00:01:12.479> of<00:01:12.720> doesn't<00:01:13.409> make

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
it didn't hurt and kind of doesn't make

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.270 
it didn't hurt and kind of doesn't make
a<00:01:13.710> spill<00:01:14.040> very<00:01:14.280> powerful<00:01:15.080> so<00:01:16.080> while<00:01:17.040> some

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
a spill very powerful so while some

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.859 
a spill very powerful so while some
people<00:01:17.400> have<00:01:17.670> suggested<00:01:17.850> we<00:01:18.390> do<00:01:18.509> it<00:01:18.630> a<00:01:18.720> little

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
people have suggested we do it a little

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.070 
people have suggested we do it a little
bit<00:01:18.960> harder<00:01:19.500> I'm<00:01:20.189> thinking<00:01:21.000> that<00:01:21.299> that<00:01:21.869> could

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
bit harder I'm thinking that that could

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.039 
bit harder I'm thinking that that could
actually<00:01:22.259> get<00:01:22.590> him<00:01:22.830> taken<00:01:22.979> away<00:01:23.250> from<00:01:23.400> us<00:01:23.670> and

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:24.049 
actually get him taken away from us and

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:28.070 
actually get him taken away from us and
them<00:01:25.280> that<00:01:26.280> could<00:01:26.490> be<00:01:26.610> fun<00:01:26.790> you<00:01:27.630> know<00:01:27.750> for<00:01:28.049> a

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
them that could be fun you know for a

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.569 
them that could be fun you know for a
little<00:01:28.200> while<00:01:28.409> but<00:01:28.770> I<00:01:28.799> think<00:01:29.130> that<00:01:29.310> I<00:01:29.340> might

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
little while but I think that I might

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.940 
little while but I think that I might
miss<00:01:29.820> him<00:01:29.850> a<00:01:30.299> little<00:01:30.540> bit<00:01:30.720> after<00:01:31.049> a<00:01:31.320> while<00:01:31.470> you

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
miss him a little bit after a while you

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.609
