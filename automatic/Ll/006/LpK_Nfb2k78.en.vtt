00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:25.870 

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:28.080 

no<00:05:26.320> yeah<00:05:26.560> you<00:05:26.620> can<00:05:26.919> hold<00:05:27.070> that<00:05:27.190> overhead<00:05:27.850> like

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:28.090 
no yeah you can hold that overhead like

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:30.120 
no yeah you can hold that overhead like
wow<00:05:28.390> yeah<00:05:29.020> I<00:05:29.140> think<00:05:29.289> that'll<00:05:29.620> only<00:05:29.710> get<00:05:29.950> if<00:05:30.039> you

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:30.130 
wow yeah I think that'll only get if you

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:34.020 
wow yeah I think that'll only get if you
have<00:05:30.310> aways<00:05:30.640> nose<00:05:30.880> in<00:05:31.150> the<00:05:31.270> boat

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:34.030 

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:35.580 

I<00:05:34.090> think<00:05:34.510> the<00:05:34.600> boat<00:05:34.810> weighs<00:05:35.020> more<00:05:35.260> than<00:05:35.320> the

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:35.590 
I think the boat weighs more than the

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:37.200 
I think the boat weighs more than the
paddle<00:05:35.979> or<00:05:36.370> the<00:05:36.490> paddle<00:05:36.820> weighs<00:05:36.970> more<00:05:37.150> than

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:37.210 
paddle or the paddle weighs more than

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:42.240 
paddle or the paddle weighs more than
the<00:05:37.450> boat<00:05:39.090> yeah<00:05:40.470> probably<00:05:41.470> a<00:05:41.650> little<00:05:41.860> thinner

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:42.250 
the boat yeah probably a little thinner

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:43.469 
the boat yeah probably a little thinner

I<00:05:43.539> don't<00:05:43.780> need<00:05:43.930> the<00:05:44.080> fibers<00:05:44.470> are<00:05:44.650> you

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:45.000 
I don't need the fibers are you

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.140
