headphones are on I'm making this video
I've<00:01:05.309> seen<00:01:05.549> a<00:01:05.579> few<00:01:05.909> on<00:01:06.240> YouTube<00:01:07.460> people<00:01:08.460> are

I've seen a few on YouTube people are

I've seen a few on YouTube people are
having<00:01:08.670> trouble<00:01:09.090> with<00:01:09.119> the<00:01:09.299> coils<00:01:10.310> no<00:01:11.310> overt<00:01:11.640> a

having trouble with the coils no overt a
bit<00:01:12.600> of<00:01:12.689> success<00:01:12.930> here<00:01:13.680> and<00:01:15.020> I'll<00:01:16.020> show<00:01:16.079> you<00:01:16.320> a

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
bit of success here and I'll show you a

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:25.240 
bit of success here and I'll show you a
few<00:01:18.619> this<00:01:19.619> coil<00:01:19.979> was<00:01:21.860> 250<00:01:22.860> ml<00:01:23.870> not<00:01:24.870> very

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:25.250 
few this coil was 250 ml not very

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:32.270 
few this coil was 250 ml not very
sensitive<00:01:27.080> really<00:01:28.080> at<00:01:28.170> all<00:01:30.860> this<00:01:31.860> one<00:01:32.130> was<00:01:32.250> a

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
sensitive really at all this one was a

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.280 
sensitive really at all this one was a
little<00:01:32.430> bit<00:01:32.700> smaller<00:01:33.090> than<00:01:33.270> that<00:01:33.570> still<00:01:34.140> not

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
little bit smaller than that still not

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:40.280 
little bit smaller than that still not
very<00:01:34.440> sensitive<00:01:38.540> but<00:01:39.540> I<00:01:39.630> have<00:01:39.750> left<00:01:39.930> a<00:01:40.049> bit<00:01:40.200> of

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
very sensitive but I have left a bit of

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.200 
very sensitive but I have left a bit of
a<00:01:40.350> breakthrough<00:01:40.650> with<00:01:41.400> modifying<00:01:42.060> these

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
a breakthrough with modifying these

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.460 
a breakthrough with modifying these
coils<00:01:42.540> and<00:01:42.960> this<00:01:43.620> is<00:01:43.799> a<00:01:44.210> 250<00:01:45.210> ml<00:01:45.350> we're<00:01:46.350> not

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
coils and this is a 250 ml we're not

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:52.130 
coils and this is a 250 ml we're not
nearly<00:01:46.680> double<00:01:47.130> the<00:01:47.250> depth<00:01:48.920> much<00:01:49.920> better<00:01:51.140> and

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
nearly double the depth much better and

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:57.109 
nearly double the depth much better and
then<00:01:52.320> I<00:01:52.350> made<00:01:52.590> a<00:01:52.619> basket<00:01:52.950> coil<00:01:54.710> this<00:01:55.710> one<00:01:56.119> this

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
then I made a basket coil this one this

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:03.289 
then I made a basket coil this one this
is<00:01:57.180> only<00:01:58.310> 7<00:01:59.310> inch<00:01:59.490> of<00:01:59.700> thing<00:01:59.850> seven<00:02:02.240> seven<00:02:03.240> and

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
is only 7 inch of thing seven seven and

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:06.410 
is only 7 inch of thing seven seven and
a<00:02:03.420> half<00:02:03.450> inch<00:02:04.430> not<00:02:05.430> very<00:02:05.670> sensitive<00:02:06.119> when<00:02:06.390> I

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
a half inch not very sensitive when I

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:12.619 
a half inch not very sensitive when I
made<00:02:06.689> it<00:02:07.459> small<00:02:08.459> gold<00:02:08.789> rings<00:02:09.090> maybe<00:02:09.539> and<00:02:11.629> seven

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629 
made it small gold rings maybe and seven

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:17.000 
made it small gold rings maybe and seven
inch<00:02:13.909> but<00:02:14.909> I've<00:02:15.090> modified<00:02:15.480> it<00:02:15.659> some<00:02:16.140> I<00:02:16.409> seem<00:02:16.980> to

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
inch but I've modified it some I seem to

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.179 
inch but I've modified it some I seem to
have<00:02:17.220> double<00:02:17.580> the<00:02:17.730> depth<00:02:17.939> on<00:02:18.150> everything

00:02:19.179 --> 00:02:19.189 
have double the depth on everything

00:02:19.189 --> 00:02:28.830 
have double the depth on everything
I'll<00:02:20.189> show<00:02:20.489> you<00:02:20.549> second

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:36.720 

this<00:02:29.840> is<00:02:30.020> a<00:02:30.050> English<00:02:31.390> toupee

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:46.270 

let's<00:02:37.730> turn<00:02:37.970> it<00:02:38.150> on<00:02:38.300> that'll<00:02:38.630> help<00:02:44.950> you<00:02:45.950> know

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 
let's turn it on that'll help you know

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:50.770 
let's turn it on that'll help you know
if<00:02:46.400> it's<00:02:46.610> about<00:02:47.110> 10<00:02:48.110> inches<00:02:49.270> much<00:02:50.270> better<00:02:50.540> than

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 
if it's about 10 inches much better than

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:53.310 
if it's about 10 inches much better than
before<00:02:51.110> with<00:02:51.230> a<00:02:51.290> basketball<00:02:51.860> before<00:02:52.070> was<00:02:52.490> only

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:53.320 
before with a basketball before was only

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:55.930 
before with a basketball before was only
about<00:02:54.320> six<00:02:54.650> inches<00:02:55.040> seven<00:02:55.400> inches<00:02:55.670> of<00:02:55.820> the

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
about six inches seven inches of the

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:06.060 
about six inches seven inches of the
most<00:02:57.790> you<00:02:58.790> see<00:02:58.940> the<00:02:59.000> twenty<00:02:59.990> pence<00:03:00.230> piece

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:06.070 

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:26.610 

again<00:03:07.070> nine<00:03:07.670> to<00:03:07.880> ten<00:03:08.090> inches<00:03:11.080> the<00:03:12.080> ten<00:03:12.709> P

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:29.850 

what<00:03:27.620> really<00:03:27.890> impresses<00:03:28.430> maybe<00:03:28.849> this<00:03:29.090> coil<00:03:29.390> is

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:29.860 
what really impresses maybe this coil is

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:33.280 
what really impresses maybe this coil is
my<00:03:30.860> wife's<00:03:31.250> got<00:03:31.430> a<00:03:31.489> very<00:03:31.760> small<00:03:32.270> thing<00:03:32.510> doll

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:33.290 
my wife's got a very small thing doll

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:36.370 
my wife's got a very small thing doll
ring<00:03:33.650> I<00:03:34.600> haven't<00:03:35.600> got<00:03:35.750> it<00:03:35.780> to<00:03:35.989> her<00:03:36.110> at<00:03:36.290> the

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:36.380 
ring I haven't got it to her at the

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:40.570 
ring I haven't got it to her at the
moment<00:03:36.830> but<00:03:37.250> she's<00:03:37.459> gone<00:03:37.670> in<00:03:37.819> it<00:03:39.430> and<00:03:40.430> it's

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:40.580 
moment but she's gone in it and it's

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:43.990 
moment but she's gone in it and it's
picking<00:03:40.790> up<00:03:41.060> at<00:03:41.239> ten<00:03:41.450> inches<00:03:41.780> as<00:03:41.989> well<00:03:43.000> whereas

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:44.000 
picking up at ten inches as well whereas

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.460 
picking up at ten inches as well whereas
before<00:03:44.420> before<00:03:44.930> I<00:03:44.959> modified<00:03:45.560> it<00:03:46.810> it<00:03:47.810> was<00:03:48.080> much

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:48.470 
before before I modified it it was much

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:51.070 
before before I modified it it was much
less<00:03:48.709> than<00:03:48.920> that<00:03:48.980> maybe<00:03:49.280> six<00:03:50.090> in<00:03:50.300> six<00:03:50.569> or<00:03:50.780> seven

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:51.080 
less than that maybe six in six or seven

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:57.580 
less than that maybe six in six or seven
inches<00:03:52.150> I<00:03:54.430> just<00:03:55.430> thought<00:03:55.610> I'd<00:03:56.110> show<00:03:57.110> you<00:03:57.140> guys

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:57.590 
inches I just thought I'd show you guys

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:59.559 
inches I just thought I'd show you guys
that<00:03:57.860> you<00:03:57.980> can<00:03:58.010> get<00:03:58.489> some<00:03:59.060> of<00:03:59.150> the<00:03:59.209> coils

00:03:59.559 --> 00:03:59.569 
that you can get some of the coils

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:02.259 
that you can get some of the coils
working<00:04:00.220> if<00:04:01.220> anybody's<00:04:01.670> got<00:04:01.850> any<00:04:01.880> interest

00:04:02.259 --> 00:04:02.269 
working if anybody's got any interest
