some problems with him you know if I
don't<00:01:55.140> know<00:01:55.259> nobody<00:01:55.470> knows<00:01:55.860> the<00:01:56.070> truth<00:01:56.280> to<00:01:56.430> be

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
don't know nobody knows the truth to be

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.160 
don't know nobody knows the truth to be
honest<00:01:56.759> for<00:01:56.880> you<00:01:57.000> yeah<00:01:57.299> I<00:01:57.570> you<00:01:57.719> know<00:01:57.990> what<00:01:58.110> I

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
honest for you yeah I you know what I

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.039 
honest for you yeah I you know what I
think<00:01:58.229> if<00:01:58.680> they<00:01:59.189> if<00:01:59.399> he<00:01:59.610> was<00:01:59.790> really<00:02:00.180> gone<00:02:00.659> I

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
think if they if he was really gone I

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.020 
think if they if he was really gone I
think<00:02:01.680> they<00:02:01.829> would<00:02:02.009> have<00:02:02.040> done<00:02:02.399> a<00:02:02.430> storyline

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
think they would have done a storyline

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.770 
think they would have done a storyline
where<00:02:03.540> Triple<00:02:04.500> H<00:02:04.619> fired<00:02:05.369> Brock<00:02:05.880> Lesnar<00:02:06.420> after

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
where Triple H fired Brock Lesnar after

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.029 
where Triple H fired Brock Lesnar after
the<00:02:06.899> assault<00:02:07.229> because<00:02:07.469> it<00:02:07.710> would<00:02:07.829> know<00:02:07.950> I

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
the assault because it would know I

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.619 
the assault because it would know I
think<00:02:08.340> it<00:02:08.489> makes<00:02:08.640> it<00:02:08.849> look<00:02:08.970> better<00:02:09.179> this<00:02:09.420> way

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
think it makes it look better this way

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.210 
think it makes it look better this way
in<00:02:09.810> case<00:02:09.989> they<00:02:10.229> renegotiate<00:02:10.920> and<00:02:11.009> get<00:02:11.099> him

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
in case they renegotiate and get him

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.820 
in case they renegotiate and get him
back<00:02:11.459> it<00:02:11.730> looks<00:02:11.819> like<00:02:12.030> he<00:02:12.180> has<00:02:12.300> a<00:02:12.330> nautical

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
back it looks like he has a nautical

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.090 
back it looks like he has a nautical
