pretty<00:00:04.340> quick<00:00:04.549> and<00:00:04.670> easy<00:00:04.850> right<00:00:05.180> so<00:00:05.390> I'll<00:00:05.479> just

00:00:05.499 --> 00:00:05.509 
pretty quick and easy right so I'll just

00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:08.100 
pretty quick and easy right so I'll just
go<00:00:05.779> ahead<00:00:05.840> go<00:00:06.680> to<00:00:06.769> my<00:00:06.890> home<00:00:07.040> view<00:00:07.370> here<00:00:07.849> and

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:08.110 
go ahead go to my home view here and

00:00:08.110 --> 00:00:10.419 
go ahead go to my home view here and
extrude<00:00:09.110> this<00:00:09.260> out<00:00:09.469> and<00:00:09.650> this<00:00:09.740> extrusion<00:00:10.190> is

00:00:10.419 --> 00:00:10.429 
extrude this out and this extrusion is

00:00:10.429 --> 00:00:12.999 
extrude this out and this extrusion is
going<00:00:10.550> to<00:00:10.639> be<00:00:10.790> 20<00:00:11.660> 2.5<00:00:12.289> millimeters<00:00:12.860> in

00:00:12.999 --> 00:00:13.009 
going to be 20 2.5 millimeters in

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:18.100 
going to be 20 2.5 millimeters in
thickness<00:00:15.580> so<00:00:16.580> I've<00:00:16.670> got<00:00:16.789> my<00:00:16.820> initial<00:00:17.300> initial

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:18.110 
thickness so I've got my initial initial

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:22.510 
thickness so I've got my initial initial
profile<00:00:18.680> my<00:00:19.550> initial<00:00:19.780> 3d<00:00:21.010> volume<00:00:22.010> here<00:00:22.280> this

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:22.520 
profile my initial 3d volume here this

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:24.130 
profile my initial 3d volume here this
the<00:00:22.880> salad<00:00:23.360> and<00:00:23.390> I<00:00:23.510> want<00:00:23.690> to<00:00:23.750> add<00:00:23.900> some

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:24.140 
the salad and I want to add some

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:26.200 
the salad and I want to add some
additional<00:00:24.290> features<00:00:24.650> to<00:00:25.220> it<00:00:25.370> nice<00:00:26.030> thing

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:26.210 
additional features to it nice thing

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:28.120 
additional features to it nice thing
about<00:00:26.270> inventors<00:00:26.750> I<00:00:26.900> see<00:00:27.080> it<00:00:27.200> is<00:00:27.320> is<00:00:27.500> that<00:00:27.740> you

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:28.130 
about inventors I see it is is that you

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:29.680 
about inventors I see it is is that you
can<00:00:28.280> literally<00:00:28.670> have<00:00:28.790> a<00:00:28.850> conversation<00:00:29.210> with

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:29.690 
can literally have a conversation with

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:31.240 
can literally have a conversation with
the<00:00:29.810> try<00:00:29.990> not<00:00:30.140> to<00:00:30.260> do<00:00:30.350> it<00:00:30.470> out<00:00:30.560> loud<00:00:30.590> people

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:31.250 
the try not to do it out loud people

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:33.520 
the try not to do it out loud people
around<00:00:31.490> you<00:00:31.790> and<00:00:31.910> your<00:00:32.029> cube<00:00:32.300> might<00:00:32.989> think

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:33.530 
around you and your cube might think

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:35.890 
around you and your cube might think
that<00:00:33.620> weird<00:00:34.070> but<00:00:34.430> essentially<00:00:35.329> with<00:00:35.720> an

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:35.900 
that weird but essentially with an

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:37.480 
that weird but essentially with an
inventor<00:00:36.410> if<00:00:36.620> you<00:00:36.800> right-click<00:00:37.070> your<00:00:37.340> mouse

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:37.490 
inventor if you right-click your mouse

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:39.370 
inventor if you right-click your mouse
it<00:00:37.940> there's<00:00:38.690> a<00:00:38.750> good<00:00:38.840> chance<00:00:39.079> what<00:00:39.290> you're

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:39.380 
it there's a good chance what you're

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:40.780 
it there's a good chance what you're
going<00:00:39.500> to<00:00:39.560> do<00:00:39.680> next<00:00:39.860> is<00:00:40.160> available<00:00:40.610> right

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:40.790 
going to do next is available right

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:43.860 
going to do next is available right
there<00:00:41.090> so<00:00:41.660> for<00:00:41.840> example<00:00:41.930> on<00:00:42.710> this<00:00:43.579> surface

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:43.870 
there so for example on this surface

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:48.550 
there so for example on this surface
this<00:00:44.870> is<00:00:45.079> a<00:00:45.110> left<00:00:45.350> click<00:00:45.530> I<00:00:45.860> want<00:00:46.610> to<00:00:47.560> right

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:48.560 
this is a left click I want to right

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:51.790 
this is a left click I want to right
click<00:00:49.390> and<00:00:50.390> that's<00:00:50.780> essentially<00:00:51.110> the<00:00:51.260> I<00:00:51.380> want

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:51.800 
click and that's essentially the I want

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.400 
click and that's essentially the I want
to<00:00:52.010> start<00:00:52.700> a<00:00:52.760> new<00:00:52.910> sketch<00:00:53.180> and<00:00:54.110> you'll<00:00:54.230> notice

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:54.410 
to start a new sketch and you'll notice

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:56.740 
to start a new sketch and you'll notice
that<00:00:54.530> if<00:00:55.100> I<00:00:55.220> right<00:00:55.430> click<00:00:55.460> this<00:00:55.820> time<00:00:56.059> I<00:00:56.090> get<00:00:56.570> a

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:56.750 
that if I right click this time I get a

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:58.690 
that if I right click this time I get a
new<00:00:57.020> longer<00:00:57.890> die<00:00:58.040> alone<00:00:58.220> now<00:00:58.399> you<00:00:58.460> probably

00:00:58.690 --> 00:00:58.700 
new longer die alone now you probably

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:00.760 
new longer die alone now you probably
can't<00:00:59.059> read<00:00:59.270> it<00:00:59.450> from<00:00:59.480> there<00:00:59.870> but

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:00.770 
can't read it from there but

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:03.130 
can't read it from there but
nevertheless<00:01:00.980> it<00:01:01.280> is<00:01:01.460> a<00:01:01.550> new<00:01:01.760> dialog<00:01:02.239> box<00:01:02.510> so

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:03.140 
nevertheless it is a new dialog box so

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:04.209 
nevertheless it is a new dialog box so
here<00:01:03.320> I'll<00:01:03.410> just<00:01:03.440> go<00:01:03.680> up<00:01:03.770> and<00:01:03.829> say<00:01:03.950> I<00:01:04.009> want<00:01:04.129> to

00:01:04.209 --> 00:01:04.219 
here I'll just go up and say I want to

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:05.439 
here I'll just go up and say I want to
project<00:01:04.369> geometry<00:01:05.089> and<00:01:05.149> I'm<00:01:05.239> going<00:01:05.390> to

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:05.449 
project geometry and I'm going to

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:07.420 
project geometry and I'm going to
project<00:01:05.600> that<00:01:05.899> outside<00:01:06.649> edge<00:01:06.979> so<00:01:07.220> I<00:01:07.280> can

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:07.430 
project that outside edge so I can

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:10.080 
project that outside edge so I can
reference<00:01:07.729> the<00:01:08.510> same<00:01:08.810> center<00:01:09.260> point<00:01:09.560> as<00:01:09.830> the

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:10.090 
reference the same center point as the

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:12.370 
reference the same center point as the
arc<00:01:11.090> that<00:01:11.270> I<00:01:11.390> sketched<00:01:11.720> out<00:01:11.810> my<00:01:12.049> initial

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:12.380 
arc that I sketched out my initial

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:16.330 
arc that I sketched out my initial
sketch<00:01:13.150> and<00:01:14.150> I'll<00:01:14.299> draw<00:01:14.600> a<00:01:14.960> circle<00:01:15.830> right<00:01:16.159> on

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:16.340 
sketch and I'll draw a circle right on

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.820 
sketch and I'll draw a circle right on
that<00:01:16.490> same<00:01:16.729> center<00:01:17.030> point<00:01:17.270> and<00:01:17.619> again<00:01:18.619> I'll

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:18.830 
that same center point and again I'll

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:21.609 
that same center point and again I'll
just<00:01:19.010> grab<00:01:19.159> a<00:01:19.280> dimension<00:01:19.760> here<00:01:20.619> 40

00:01:21.609 --> 00:01:21.619 
just grab a dimension here 40

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:23.920 
just grab a dimension here 40
millimeters<00:01:22.100> something<00:01:22.430> like<00:01:22.610> that<00:01:22.880> and<00:01:23.150> go

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:23.930 
millimeters something like that and go

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:26.710 
millimeters something like that and go
ahead<00:01:23.960> and<00:01:24.200> extrude<00:01:25.010> this<00:01:25.490> up<00:01:25.790> also<00:01:26.360> 40

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:26.720 
ahead and extrude this up also 40

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:28.480 
ahead and extrude this up also 40
millimeters<00:01:27.200> but<00:01:27.320> I<00:01:27.380> want<00:01:27.619> to<00:01:27.680> add<00:01:27.830> a<00:01:27.860> taper<00:01:28.190> to

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:28.490 
millimeters but I want to add a taper to

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:30.670 
millimeters but I want to add a taper to
it<00:01:28.520> and<00:01:28.790> I<00:01:29.180> was<00:01:29.240> going<00:01:29.510> to<00:01:29.600> the<00:01:29.690> more<00:01:29.930> tab<00:01:30.229> kind

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:30.680 
it and I was going to the more tab kind

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.190 
it and I was going to the more tab kind
of<00:01:30.740> on<00:01:30.830> the<00:01:31.040> fly<00:01:31.220> rather<00:01:32.090> than<00:01:32.330> jumping<00:01:32.810> back

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:33.200 
of on the fly rather than jumping back

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.770 
of on the fly rather than jumping back
and<00:01:33.229> forth<00:01:33.439> between<00:01:33.770> different<00:01:34.780> different

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:35.780 
and forth between different different

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:38.410 
and forth between different different
features<00:01:36.140> I'll<00:01:36.320> just<00:01:36.470> grab<00:01:36.590> a<00:01:37.180> negative<00:01:38.180> 5

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:38.420 
features I'll just grab a negative 5

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:40.600 
features I'll just grab a negative 5
degree<00:01:38.780> taper<00:01:38.990> right<00:01:39.320> there<00:01:39.530> so<00:01:40.220> I've<00:01:40.430> got

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:40.610 
degree taper right there so I've got

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:42.520 
degree taper right there so I've got
again<00:01:41.360> yet<00:01:41.570> another<00:01:41.869> feature<00:01:42.140> on<00:01:42.380> this

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:42.530 
again yet another feature on this

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.070 
again yet another feature on this
particular<00:01:42.710> 3d<00:01:43.280> component<00:01:43.580> and<00:01:43.939> really<00:01:44.240> not

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:45.080 
particular 3d component and really not

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:46.929 
particular 3d component and really not
that<00:01:45.260> hard<00:01:45.470> next<00:01:45.799> I<00:01:45.890> want<00:01:46.009> to<00:01:46.130> go<00:01:46.189> and<00:01:46.520> I<00:01:46.759> want

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:46.939 
that hard next I want to go and I want

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:48.370 
that hard next I want to go and I want
to<00:01:47.030> i'm<00:01:47.330> going<00:01:47.479> to<00:01:47.540> drill<00:01:47.750> a<00:01:47.780> hole<00:01:47.840> through

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
to i'm going to drill a hole through

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.310 
to i'm going to drill a hole through
that<00:01:48.950> for<00:01:49.460> that<00:01:49.580> boss<00:01:49.790> there<00:01:50.119> and<00:01:50.360> we'll<00:01:51.080> just

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:51.320 
that for that boss there and we'll just
