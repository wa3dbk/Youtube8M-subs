friends<00:00:23.880> at<00:00:23.970> thermaltake<00:00:24.779> this<00:00:25.529> is<00:00:25.680> basically

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
friends at thermaltake this is basically

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.040 
friends at thermaltake this is basically
the<00:00:26.160> same<00:00:26.430> price<00:00:26.730> range<00:00:26.939> as<00:00:27.390> their<00:00:27.660> frio

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
the same price range as their frio

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.990 
the same price range as their frio
product<00:00:28.560> but<00:00:28.980> this<00:00:29.160> actually<00:00:29.369> works<00:00:29.789> with

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
product but this actually works with

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.569 
product but this actually works with
CPUs<00:00:30.420> that<00:00:30.570> have<00:00:30.720> a<00:00:30.750> higher<00:00:31.019> TDP<00:00:31.740> so<00:00:32.309> this<00:00:32.430> will

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
CPUs that have a higher TDP so this will

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.970 
CPUs that have a higher TDP so this will
work<00:00:32.700> with<00:00:32.880> all<00:00:33.090> the<00:00:33.329> high-end<00:00:33.540> AMD<00:00:34.170> CPUs<00:00:34.739> all

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
of the high-end Intel CPUs and it's

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.040 
of the high-end Intel CPUs and it's
really<00:00:38.219> geared<00:00:38.430> to<00:00:38.610> keep<00:00:38.790> things<00:00:39.059> cool<00:00:39.390> so<00:00:39.899> now
