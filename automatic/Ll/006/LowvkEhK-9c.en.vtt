hop<00:01:55.979> in<00:01:56.189> to<00:01:56.549> number<00:01:56.820> 4<00:01:57.560> alright<00:01:58.560> so<00:01:58.920> number<00:01:59.189> 4

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
hop in to number 4 alright so number 4

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.219 
hop in to number 4 alright so number 4

you here
Bruno<00:02:04.799> plays<00:02:05.040> shader<00:02:05.310> and<00:02:05.490> although<00:02:06.329> all<00:02:06.750> the

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
Bruno plays shader and although all the

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:07.969 
Bruno plays shader and although all the
links<00:02:07.200> will<00:02:07.290> be<00:02:07.320> in<00:02:07.409> the<00:02:07.500> description<00:02:07.860> down

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
links will be in the description down

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.370 
links will be in the description down
below<00:02:08.090> that<00:02:09.090> the<00:02:09.959> whatever<00:02:10.379> it's<00:02:10.649> called

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:11.380 
below that the whatever it's called

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:14.910 
below that the whatever it's called
are<00:02:11.860> less<00:02:12.190> glitchy<00:02:12.610> in<00:02:12.970> this<00:02:13.120> one<00:02:13.270> I<00:02:13.480> find<00:02:13.920> but

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
are less glitchy in this one I find but

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.100 
are less glitchy in this one I find but
keep<00:02:15.250> in<00:02:15.370> mind<00:02:15.580> that<00:02:15.760> I<00:02:15.940> am<00:02:15.970> unamplified<00:02:16.630> so

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
keep in mind that I am unamplified so

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:18.630 
keep in mind that I am unamplified so
there<00:02:17.260> is<00:02:17.440> going<00:02:17.590> to<00:02:17.650> be<00:02:17.740> stuff<00:02:18.040> spawning<00:02:18.460> in

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
there is going to be stuff spawning in

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.160 
there is going to be stuff spawning in
the<00:02:18.670> air<00:02:18.820> like<00:02:19.030> that<00:02:19.060> to<00:02:19.600> kind<00:02:19.780> of<00:02:19.870> glitch<00:02:20.050> it

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
the air like that to kind of glitch it

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.100 
the air like that to kind of glitch it
out<00:02:20.320> so<00:02:21.130> yeah<00:02:21.460> this<00:02:21.730> the<00:02:22.240> shaders<00:02:22.540> aren't<00:02:22.990> as

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
out so yeah this the shaders aren't as

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:25.620 
out so yeah this the shaders aren't as
glitched<00:02:23.500> as<00:02:23.710> I<00:02:23.830> said<00:02:24.070> but<00:02:24.550> the<00:02:24.670> water<00:02:25.000> is<00:02:25.270> and

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
glitched as I said but the water is and

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:27.330 
glitched as I said but the water is and
that's<00:02:25.960> the<00:02:26.080> only<00:02:26.500> downside<00:02:26.710> of<00:02:27.040> this<00:02:27.100> shader

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
that's the only downside of this shader

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:30.000 
that's the only downside of this shader
pack<00:02:27.550> is<00:02:27.760> that<00:02:27.880> see<00:02:28.510> it's<00:02:28.750> it's<00:02:29.110> in<00:02:29.380> chunks<00:02:29.860> so

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
pack is that see it's it's in chunks so

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:31.800 
pack is that see it's it's in chunks so
you<00:02:30.220> can<00:02:30.460> see<00:02:30.580> like<00:02:30.700> one<00:02:30.880> chunks<00:02:31.240> there<00:02:31.480> and

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
you can see like one chunks there and

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:34.380 
you can see like one chunks there and
then<00:02:31.900> one<00:02:32.110> chunks<00:02:32.410> here<00:02:32.650> and<00:02:32.860> stuff<00:02:33.100> so<00:02:33.430> that's

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
then one chunks here and stuff so that's

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:35.970 
then one chunks here and stuff so that's
just<00:02:34.660> that's<00:02:35.020> the<00:02:35.140> only<00:02:35.410> downside<00:02:35.770> to<00:02:35.800> this

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
just that's the only downside to this

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.190 
just that's the only downside to this
otherwise<00:02:36.430> this<00:02:36.790> would<00:02:36.940> be<00:02:37.030> like<00:02:37.330> number<00:02:37.870> one

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
otherwise this would be like number one

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:39.960 
otherwise this would be like number one
because<00:02:38.410> it<00:02:38.560> I<00:02:38.590> love<00:02:39.100> this<00:02:39.220> shader<00:02:39.460> pack<00:02:39.640> so

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
because it I love this shader pack so

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:41.640 
because it I love this shader pack so
much<00:02:40.120> it's<00:02:40.360> like<00:02:40.570> the<00:02:41.020> perfect<00:02:41.260> brightness

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
much it's like the perfect brightness

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:44.610 
much it's like the perfect brightness
and<00:02:42.210> yeah<00:02:43.210> it's<00:02:43.540> it's<00:02:43.870> really<00:02:44.140> awesome<00:02:44.230> I<00:02:44.440> like

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
and yeah it's it's really awesome I like

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:45.750 
and yeah it's it's really awesome I like

number<00:02:56.740> three<00:02:57.280> on<00:02:57.520> my<00:02:57.550> list<00:02:57.730> is<00:02:58.120> a<00:02:58.180> cocoa

00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:58.600 
number three on my list is a cocoa

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.990 
number three on my list is a cocoa
pocket<00:02:59.020> park<00:02:59.200> jump<00:02:59.470> chopper<00:02:59.800> chopper<00:03:00.010> one<00:03:00.700> and

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
pocket park jump chopper chopper one and

pocket park jump chopper chopper one and
it's<00:03:01.720> just<00:03:01.900> one<00:03:02.020> chop<00:03:02.290> it<00:03:02.440> above<00:03:02.620> a<00:03:02.650> 13<00:03:03.190> V<00:03:03.430> 3

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700 
it's just one chop it above a 13 V 3

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.110 
it's just one chop it above a 13 V 3
after<00:03:04.090> all<00:03:04.330> the<00:03:04.600> ultra<00:03:05.140> shader<00:03:05.350> pack<00:03:05.590> and<00:03:06.120> yeah

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
after all the ultra shader pack and yeah

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.460 
after all the ultra shader pack and yeah
what<00:03:07.300> I<00:03:07.330> really<00:03:07.600> like<00:03:07.750> about<00:03:07.780> this<00:03:08.110> one<00:03:08.170> is

what I really like about this one is

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:11.010 
what I really like about this one is

but that's alright and the thing I
really<00:03:21.520> like<00:03:21.670> about<00:03:21.700> this<00:03:22.030> as<00:03:22.210> well<00:03:22.480> is<00:03:22.690> it

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
really like about this as well is it

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.630 
really like about this as well is it
doesn't<00:03:24.280> really<00:03:24.580> look<00:03:25.770> too<00:03:26.770> different<00:03:27.250> from

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:27.640 
doesn't really look too different from

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:29.190 
doesn't really look too different from
default<00:03:28.150> if<00:03:28.300> you<00:03:28.360> know<00:03:28.780> what<00:03:28.870> I'm<00:03:28.960> trying<00:03:29.050> to

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.200 
default if you know what I'm trying to

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.050 
default if you know what I'm trying to
say<00:03:29.410> so<00:03:29.950> like<00:03:30.070> you<00:03:30.220> can<00:03:30.250> you<00:03:30.520> see<00:03:30.730> it<00:03:30.820> and<00:03:30.940> you

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.060 
say so like you can you see it and you

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:33.330 
say so like you can you see it and you
can<00:03:31.210> really<00:03:31.420> tell<00:03:31.660> the<00:03:31.720> shaders<00:03:32.200> on<00:03:32.380> it<00:03:32.530> but<00:03:33.070> it

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:33.340 
can really tell the shaders on it but it

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:36.770 
can really tell the shaders on it but it
looks<00:03:34.060> a<00:03:34.330> lot<00:03:34.810> like<00:03:35.020> default<00:03:35.530> as<00:03:35.710> well<00:03:35.890> so

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
looks a lot like default as well so

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:39.300 
looks a lot like default as well so
anyways<00:03:37.780> yeah<00:03:37.990> that's<00:03:38.350> number<00:03:38.680> three<00:03:38.950> on<00:03:39.130> the

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:39.310 
anyways yeah that's number three on the

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:43.530 
anyways yeah that's number three on the
list<00:03:39.460> and<00:03:40.530> yeah<00:03:41.530> let's<00:03:41.890> move<00:03:42.160> into<00:03:42.520> number<00:03:43.270> two

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:43.540 
list and yeah let's move into number two

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:46.830 
list and yeah let's move into number two
all<00:03:44.350> right<00:03:44.410> so<00:03:45.220> here's<00:03:45.610> number<00:03:46.030> two<00:03:46.240> it<00:03:46.450> is

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:46.840 
all right so here's number two it is

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:48.900 
all right so here's number two it is
called<00:03:47.170> vision<00:03:47.530> craft<00:03:47.980> and<00:03:48.340> I'll<00:03:48.459> show<00:03:48.730> you<00:03:48.760> in

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:48.910 
called vision craft and I'll show you in

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:52.020 
called vision craft and I'll show you in
here<00:03:49.030> its<00:03:49.570> vision<00:03:49.900> craft<00:03:50.080> v2<00:03:50.560> shader<00:03:50.860> pack<00:03:51.070> now

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.030 
here its vision craft v2 shader pack now

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:56.130 
here its vision craft v2 shader pack now
this<00:03:52.720> one<00:03:52.959> is<00:03:53.430> one<00:03:54.430> of<00:03:54.550> like<00:03:54.910> it<00:03:55.300> obviously

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:56.140 
this one is one of like it obviously

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:58.800 
this one is one of like it obviously
it's<00:03:56.920> in<00:03:57.130> my<00:03:57.220> top<00:03:57.430> 5<00:03:57.700> but<00:03:58.360> this<00:03:58.480> one<00:03:58.660> is

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:58.810 
it's in my top 5 but this one is

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:00.210 
it's in my top 5 but this one is
different<00:03:58.990> from<00:03:59.260> the<00:03:59.440> others<00:03:59.650> you<00:03:59.800> guys<00:03:59.980> can

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:00.220 
different from the others you guys can

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:03.180 
different from the others you guys can
tell<00:04:00.490> like<00:04:01.209> everything<00:04:01.959> like<00:04:02.470> the<00:04:02.620> colors<00:04:03.010> are

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:03.190 
tell like everything like the colors are

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:05.370 
tell like everything like the colors are
more<00:04:03.340> enhanced<00:04:03.730> this<00:04:04.000> sand<00:04:04.450> is<00:04:04.690> like<00:04:04.720> super

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:05.380 
more enhanced this sand is like super

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:08.250 
more enhanced this sand is like super
yellow<00:04:05.620> and<00:04:06.610> I<00:04:07.180> mean<00:04:07.420> I<00:04:07.540> don't<00:04:07.930> really<00:04:08.080> like

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:08.260 
yellow and I mean I don't really like

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:09.660 
yellow and I mean I don't really like
playing<00:04:08.380> with<00:04:08.590> this<00:04:08.740> in<00:04:09.010> game<00:04:09.250> because<00:04:09.550> it

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:09.670 
playing with this in game because it

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:12.600 
playing with this in game because it
feels<00:04:09.850> kind<00:04:10.150> of<00:04:10.270> weird<00:04:10.480> but<00:04:11.140> I<00:04:11.290> really<00:04:11.320> do<00:04:12.040> like

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:12.610 
feels kind of weird but I really do like

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:15.060 
feels kind of weird but I really do like
using<00:04:13.570> this<00:04:13.720> just<00:04:14.110> to<00:04:14.260> like<00:04:14.410> go<00:04:14.560> around<00:04:14.650> just

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:15.070 
using this just to like go around just

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:17.340 
using this just to like go around just
because<00:04:15.160> of<00:04:15.340> how<00:04:15.459> awesome<00:04:15.700> it<00:04:16.060> looks<00:04:16.090> so<00:04:17.020> it

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:17.350 
because of how awesome it looks so it

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:19.080 
because of how awesome it looks so it
does<00:04:17.650> have<00:04:17.890> like<00:04:18.040> the<00:04:18.160> focus<00:04:18.580> effect<00:04:18.910> like<00:04:19.060> you

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:19.090 
does have like the focus effect like you

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:20.180 
does have like the focus effect like you
can<00:04:19.299> see<00:04:19.450> a<00:04:19.479> soft<00:04:19.720> focus

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.190 
can see a soft focus

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:22.310 
can see a soft focus
and<00:04:20.489> stuff<00:04:20.700> and<00:04:20.880> it's<00:04:21.420> weird<00:04:21.780> in<00:04:21.930> that<00:04:22.019> aspect

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:22.320 
and stuff and it's weird in that aspect

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:24.500 
and stuff and it's weird in that aspect
so<00:04:22.830> it's<00:04:23.490> got<00:04:23.640> like<00:04:23.760> the<00:04:23.910> weirdest<00:04:24.330> framer

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:24.510 
so it's got like the weirdest framer

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:28.070 
so it's got like the weirdest framer
library<00:04:24.990> so<00:04:25.800> yeah<00:04:26.160> and<00:04:26.660> I'm<00:04:27.660> the<00:04:27.690> only

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:28.080 
library so yeah and I'm the only

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:29.930 
library so yeah and I'm the only
downside<00:04:28.680> to<00:04:28.800> this<00:04:28.920> in<00:04:29.160> my<00:04:29.340> opinion<00:04:29.760> is<00:04:29.880> that

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:29.940 
downside to this in my opinion is that

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:32.990 
downside to this in my opinion is that
the<00:04:30.180> water<00:04:30.450> hasn't<00:04:30.780> changed<00:04:31.260> at<00:04:31.500> all<00:04:31.560> and<00:04:32.000> my

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:33.000 
the water hasn't changed at all and my

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.270 
the water hasn't changed at all and my
hand<00:04:33.480> is<00:04:33.690> blurry<00:04:34.080> and<00:04:34.380> I<00:04:34.740> really<00:04:35.040> don't<00:04:35.220> like

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:35.280 
hand is blurry and I really don't like

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:36.950 
hand is blurry and I really don't like
that<00:04:35.340> about<00:04:35.550> shader<00:04:35.880> packs<00:04:36.120> and<00:04:36.510> I<00:04:36.570> don't<00:04:36.870> know

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:36.960 
that about shader packs and I don't know

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:39.470 
that about shader packs and I don't know
if<00:04:37.110> that's<00:04:37.290> possible<00:04:37.560> to<00:04:37.890> change<00:04:38.100> but<00:04:38.490> yeah

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:39.480 
if that's possible to change but yeah

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:42.440 
if that's possible to change but yeah
that<00:04:39.780> bugs<00:04:40.050> me<00:04:40.140> a<00:04:40.230> lot<00:04:40.440> but<00:04:40.940> yeah<00:04:41.940> and<00:04:42.150> what's

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:42.450 
that bugs me a lot but yeah and what's

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:43.910 
that bugs me a lot but yeah and what's
also<00:04:42.630> good<00:04:42.810> about<00:04:42.930> this<00:04:43.110> is<00:04:43.290> it<00:04:43.440> doesn't<00:04:43.650> take

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:43.920 
also good about this is it doesn't take

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:46.580 
also good about this is it doesn't take
too<00:04:44.220> too<00:04:44.430> much<00:04:44.550> computer<00:04:45.090> power<00:04:45.360> to<00:04:45.480> run<00:04:45.930> so<00:04:46.530> if

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:46.590 
too too much computer power to run so if

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:47.870 
too too much computer power to run so if
you<00:04:46.680> don't<00:04:46.800> have<00:04:46.920> the<00:04:47.010> greatest<00:04:47.370> computer

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:47.880 
you don't have the greatest computer

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:49.400 
you don't have the greatest computer
then<00:04:48.090> you<00:04:48.120> probably<00:04:48.660> will<00:04:48.870> be<00:04:48.900> able<00:04:49.110> to<00:04:49.230> run

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:49.410 
then you probably will be able to run

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:52.340 
then you probably will be able to run
this<00:04:49.620> at<00:04:49.890> a<00:04:49.950> decent<00:04:50.250> framerate<00:04:50.510> so<00:04:51.510> that's<00:04:52.200> a

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:52.350 
this at a decent framerate so that's a

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:55.630 
this at a decent framerate so that's a
thing<00:04:52.620> anyways<00:04:53.280> let's<00:04:53.610> jump<00:04:53.880> into<00:04:54.090> number<00:04:54.870> one

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:55.640 
thing anyways let's jump into number one

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:58.280 
thing anyways let's jump into number one
alright<00:04:56.640> so<00:04:56.700> here<00:04:57.150> is<00:04:57.180> number<00:04:57.720> one<00:04:57.930> on<00:04:58.140> the

00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:58.290 
alright so here is number one on the

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:01.070 
alright so here is number one on the
list<00:04:58.470> now<00:04:58.680> this<00:04:58.860> is<00:04:59.040> definitely<00:04:59.460> like<00:05:00.150> in<00:05:00.990> the

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:01.080 
list now this is definitely like in the

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:03.830 
list now this is definitely like in the
top<00:05:01.260> three<00:05:01.530> my<00:05:01.650> favorite<00:05:01.830> ones<00:05:02.370> ever<00:05:02.700> and<00:05:03.120> this

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:03.840 
top three my favorite ones ever and this

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:05.570 
top three my favorite ones ever and this
one's<00:05:04.050> super<00:05:04.230> awesome<00:05:04.800> because<00:05:05.070> as<00:05:05.310> you<00:05:05.460> can

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:05.580 
one's super awesome because as you can

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:07.670 
one's super awesome because as you can
see<00:05:05.640> it<00:05:06.090> doesn't<00:05:06.480> change<00:05:06.690> too<00:05:07.050> much<00:05:07.230> but<00:05:07.560> the

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:07.680 
see it doesn't change too much but the

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:09.980 
see it doesn't change too much but the
big<00:05:08.040> thing<00:05:08.340> about<00:05:08.430> this<00:05:08.820> is<00:05:09.300> you<00:05:09.480> can<00:05:09.630> see<00:05:09.810> that

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:09.990 
big thing about this is you can see that

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:12.080 
big thing about this is you can see that
it<00:05:10.080> focuses<00:05:10.620> on<00:05:10.740> the<00:05:10.830> close<00:05:11.100> things<00:05:11.400> and<00:05:11.670> in

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:12.090 
it focuses on the close things and in

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:14.570 
it focuses on the close things and in
the<00:05:12.180> background<00:05:12.660> it<00:05:12.870> isn't<00:05:13.770> focused<00:05:14.130> so<00:05:14.460> it

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:14.580 
the background it isn't focused so it

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:16.220 
the background it isn't focused so it
makes<00:05:14.790> everything<00:05:15.360> have<00:05:15.540> like<00:05:15.690> this<00:05:15.990> really

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:16.230 
makes everything have like this really

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:18.140 
makes everything have like this really
nice<00:05:16.440> depth<00:05:16.860> to<00:05:17.160> it<00:05:17.190> and<00:05:17.430> it's<00:05:17.550> so<00:05:17.910> awesome

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:18.150 
nice depth to it and it's so awesome

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:20.780 
nice depth to it and it's so awesome
like<00:05:19.140> it<00:05:19.320> just<00:05:19.500> it<00:05:20.220> just<00:05:20.370> makes<00:05:20.520> everything

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:20.790
