00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
finished recording so probably that will

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:09.999

three people that I think you even have

00:02:37.909 --> 00:02:40.000 
three people that I think you even have
to<00:02:38.090> change<00:02:38.269> the<00:02:38.389> name<00:02:38.689> I<00:02:38.959> don't<00:02:39.500> know<00:02:39.769> maybe

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
to change the name I don't know maybe

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:42.159 
to change the name I don't know maybe
that's<00:02:40.219> just<00:02:40.370> me<00:02:40.549> but<00:02:41.030> Top<00:02:41.329> Gear<00:02:41.569> the<00:02:41.599> BBC

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:42.169 
that's just me but Top Gear the BBC

00:02:42.169 --> 00:02:43.890 
that's just me but Top Gear the BBC
they're<00:02:42.709> gonna<00:02:42.859> have<00:02:43.069> some<00:02:43.250> car<00:02:43.459> shows<00:02:43.669> to

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
they're gonna have some car shows to

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.479 
they're gonna have some car shows to
probably<00:02:44.900> most<00:02:45.200> likely<00:02:45.590> we<00:02:46.010> probably<00:02:46.280> won't

00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:46.489 
probably most likely we probably won't

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:48.099 
probably most likely we probably won't
see<00:02:46.669> anything<00:02:47.120> for<00:02:47.269> quite<00:02:47.480> a<00:02:47.510> while

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:48.109 
see anything for quite a while

00:02:48.109 --> 00:02:50.110 
see anything for quite a while
but<00:02:48.590> I<00:02:48.769> I<00:02:48.799> would<00:02:49.040> assume<00:02:49.400> that<00:02:49.639> they<00:02:49.760> will<00:02:49.879> do

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
but I I would assume that they will do

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.270 
but I I would assume that they will do
something<00:02:50.389> car<00:02:50.810> oriented<00:02:51.439> on<00:02:51.560> the<00:02:51.620> BBC

something car oriented on the BBC

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:53.500 
something car oriented on the BBC
because<00:02:52.340> they<00:02:52.519> have<00:02:52.639> all<00:02:52.790> Dunsfold<00:02:53.209> they<00:02:53.389> have

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:54.759 
because they have all Dunsfold they have
all<00:02:53.629> this<00:02:53.750> equipment<00:02:53.989> and<00:02:54.260> stuff<00:02:54.500> and<00:02:54.620> it's

00:02:54.759 --> 00:02:54.769 
all this equipment and stuff and it's

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:55.750 
all this equipment and stuff and it's
