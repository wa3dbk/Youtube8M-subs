today<00:00:06.080> we<00:00:06.230> are<00:00:06.350> going<00:00:06.529> to<00:00:06.590> discuss<00:00:06.980> latitude

00:00:07.749 --> 00:00:07.759 
today we are going to discuss latitude

00:00:07.759 --> 00:00:11.140 
today we are going to discuss latitude
and<00:00:07.880> longitude<00:00:08.950> latitude<00:00:09.950> is<00:00:10.400> represented<00:00:11.030> on

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:11.150 
and longitude latitude is represented on

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:13.570 
and longitude latitude is represented on
earth<00:00:11.360> by<00:00:11.690> horizontal<00:00:12.110> lines<00:00:12.590> that<00:00:12.860> run<00:00:13.250> east

another now let's look at the earth like

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.680 
another now let's look at the earth like
a<00:00:56.420> pie<00:00:56.780> or<00:00:57.140> will<00:00:57.410> the<00:00:58.039> earth<00:00:58.219> is<00:00:58.460> a<00:00:58.489> 360<00:00:59.210> degree

a pie or will the earth is a 360 degree
circle<00:01:00.020> now<00:01:00.680> we<00:01:00.710> can<00:01:00.980> divide<00:01:01.100> into<00:01:01.460> many

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:01.730 
circle now we can divide into many

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:04.689 
circle now we can divide into many
sections<00:01:02.350> for<00:01:03.350> instance<00:01:03.710> take<00:01:04.309> out<00:01:04.489> one

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:04.699 
sections for instance take out one

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:06.730 
sections for instance take out one
quarter<00:01:05.089> of<00:01:05.119> the<00:01:05.239> earth<00:01:05.449> and<00:01:05.720> you<00:01:06.110> will<00:01:06.259> get<00:01:06.350> 90

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:06.740 
quarter of the earth and you will get 90

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:09.700 
quarter of the earth and you will get 90
degrees<00:01:07.720> we<00:01:08.720> can<00:01:08.869> still<00:01:09.110> split<00:01:09.380> up<00:01:09.470> the<00:01:09.590> earth

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:09.710 
degrees we can still split up the earth

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:13.810 
degrees we can still split up the earth
again<00:01:10.070> into<00:01:10.580> 45<00:01:11.000> degrees<00:01:11.360> and<00:01:11.869> so<00:01:12.860> on<00:01:12.920> and<00:01:13.369> so

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:13.820 
again into 45 degrees and so on and so

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:19.030 
again into 45 degrees and so on and so
on<00:01:16.210> there<00:01:17.210> are<00:01:17.360> five<00:01:17.630> major<00:01:18.020> named<00:01:18.470> lines<00:01:18.799> of

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660 
country of Cuba still I don't think that

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:40.180 
country of Cuba still I don't think that
would<00:02:38.810> allow<00:02:39.020> someone<00:02:39.290> to<00:02:39.440> effectively

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 
would allow someone to effectively

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:42.760 
would allow someone to effectively
remember<00:02:40.610> which<00:02:40.970> goes<00:02:41.240> where<00:02:41.470> so<00:02:42.470> I<00:02:42.500> have<00:02:42.740> a

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:42.770 
remember which goes where so I have a

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:44.260 
remember which goes where so I have a
couple<00:02:43.040> of<00:02:43.220> other<00:02:43.520> ways<00:02:43.760> to<00:02:43.820> help<00:02:44.090> you

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:44.270 
couple of other ways to help you

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:47.430 
couple of other ways to help you
remember<00:02:45.730> let's<00:02:46.730> look<00:02:46.910> in<00:02:47.030> the<00:02:47.060> dictionary

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 
remember let's look in the dictionary

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:51.220 
remember let's look in the dictionary
from<00:02:48.440> an<00:02:48.530> alphabetical<00:02:49.340> standpoint<00:02:49.940> the<00:02:50.660> c8

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
from an alphabetical standpoint the c8

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:54.430 
from an alphabetical standpoint the c8
in<00:02:51.560> in<00:02:51.890> cancer<00:02:52.580> would<00:02:52.940> be<00:02:53.060> a<00:02:53.090> found<00:02:53.930> above<00:02:54.260> the

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440

C ap in Capricorn in other words the
Tropic<00:02:59.030> of<00:02:59.120> Cancer<00:02:59.390> would<00:03:00.110> be<00:03:00.260> higher<00:03:00.590> on<00:03:00.860> the

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 
Tropic of Cancer would be higher on the

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:03.910 
Tropic of Cancer would be higher on the
page<00:03:01.220> than<00:03:01.820> the<00:03:01.850> Tropic<00:03:02.330> of<00:03:02.420> Capricorn<00:03:02.920> just

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920 
page than the Tropic of Capricorn just

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:05.760 
page than the Tropic of Capricorn just
like<00:03:04.130> it<00:03:04.280> is<00:03:04.400> on<00:03:04.580> the<00:03:04.670> earth

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:05.770 
like it is on the earth

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:09.340 
like it is on the earth
okay<00:03:06.770> now<00:03:07.190> let's<00:03:07.459> weigh<00:03:07.670> the<00:03:07.850> two<00:03:08.000> words<00:03:08.350> let's

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:09.350 
okay now let's weigh the two words let's

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:10.810 
okay now let's weigh the two words let's
pretend<00:03:09.709> that<00:03:09.800> all<00:03:10.040> the<00:03:10.280> letters<00:03:10.610> are<00:03:10.790> the

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:10.820 
pretend that all the letters are the

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:13.810 
pretend that all the letters are the
same<00:03:10.940> size<00:03:11.420> and<00:03:11.690> weight<00:03:11.750> the<00:03:12.610> simplified<00:03:13.610> that

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:13.820 
same size and weight the simplified that

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:16.890 
same size and weight the simplified that
Capricorn<00:03:14.510> has<00:03:14.750> nine<00:03:15.080> letters<00:03:15.530> to<00:03:16.010> cancer<00:03:16.370> six

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:16.900 
Capricorn has nine letters to cancer six

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.840 
Capricorn has nine letters to cancer six
obviously<00:03:17.900> means<00:03:18.140> that<00:03:18.290> Capricorn<00:03:19.100> weighs

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:19.850 
obviously means that Capricorn weighs

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:24.430 
obviously means that Capricorn weighs
more<00:03:20.209> and<00:03:20.450> will<00:03:20.870> sink<00:03:21.800> below<00:03:22.580> cancer<00:03:23.290> see<00:03:24.290> what

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:24.440 
more and will sink below cancer see what

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:25.500 
more and will sink below cancer see what
I<00:03:24.470> did<00:03:24.620> there

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:25.510 
I did there

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:29.320 
I did there
okay<00:03:26.510> one<00:03:27.050> more<00:03:27.230> the<00:03:28.160> Tropic<00:03:28.519> of<00:03:28.640> Cancer<00:03:28.880> runs

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:29.330 
okay one more the Tropic of Cancer runs

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:31.960 
okay one more the Tropic of Cancer runs
through<00:03:29.570> Mexico<00:03:30.080> near<00:03:30.769> its<00:03:31.010> capital<00:03:31.519> Mexico

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:31.970 
through Mexico near its capital Mexico

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:34.810 
through Mexico near its capital Mexico
City<00:03:32.560> did<00:03:33.560> you<00:03:33.830> know<00:03:34.040> that<00:03:34.070> breathing<00:03:34.550> the<00:03:34.790> air

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:34.820 
City did you know that breathing the air

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:37.180 
City did you know that breathing the air
for<00:03:35.300> one<00:03:35.540> day<00:03:35.750> in<00:03:35.959> Mexico<00:03:36.410> City<00:03:36.650> is<00:03:36.920> like

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:37.190 
for one day in Mexico City is like

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:40.720 
for one day in Mexico City is like
smoking<00:03:37.550> 40<00:03:38.209> cigarettes<00:03:38.480> and<00:03:39.280> we<00:03:40.280> all<00:03:40.400> know

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:40.730 
smoking 40 cigarettes and we all know

smoking 40 cigarettes and we all know
about<00:03:40.910> cigarettes<00:03:41.420> cause<00:03:44.230> finally<00:03:45.230> we<00:03:45.560> need

00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:45.709 
about cigarettes cause finally we need

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:50.020 
about cigarettes cause finally we need
to<00:03:45.890> discuss<00:03:46.340> the<00:03:46.970> equator<00:03:48.340> the<00:03:49.340> Equator<00:03:49.760> cuts

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:50.030 
to discuss the equator the Equator cuts

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:52.900 
to discuss the equator the Equator cuts
the<00:03:50.180> earth<00:03:50.330> and<00:03:50.630> half<00:03:50.840> given<00:03:51.680> us<00:03:51.800> the<00:03:52.070> southern

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:52.910 
the earth and half given us the southern

the<00:03:59.120> equator<00:03:59.480> is<00:03:59.690> also<00:04:00.050> the<00:04:00.170> halfway<00:04:00.410> point

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:00.620 
the equator is also the halfway point

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:05.550 
the equator is also the halfway point
between<00:04:01.100> the<00:04:02.090> north<00:04:02.360> and<00:04:03.010> south<00:04:04.010> poles

now you may ask why do we need to know

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:10.540 
now you may ask why do we need to know
