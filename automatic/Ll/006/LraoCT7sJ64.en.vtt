hi<00:00:03.919> I'm<00:00:04.310> a<00:00:04.549> fly<00:00:04.790> and<00:00:05.060> welcome<00:00:05.420> today<00:00:06.140> we're

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:06.290 
hi I'm a fly and welcome today we're

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:07.480 
hi I'm a fly and welcome today we're
going<00:00:06.319> to<00:00:06.439> look<00:00:06.590> at<00:00:06.740> creating<00:00:07.130> this<00:00:07.220> very

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:07.490 
going to look at creating this very

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:09.100 
going to look at creating this very
simple<00:00:07.819> effect<00:00:08.240> which<00:00:08.570> can<00:00:08.840> do<00:00:08.960> without

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:09.110 
simple effect which can do without

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:10.419 
simple effect which can do without
actually<00:00:09.679> having<00:00:09.800> to<00:00:09.950> go<00:00:10.070> out<00:00:10.219> to<00:00:10.309> buy

00:00:10.419 --> 00:00:10.429 
actually having to go out to buy

00:00:10.429 --> 00:00:13.330 
actually having to go out to buy
anything<00:00:10.610> fancy<00:00:11.210> so<00:00:12.110> this<00:00:12.590> is<00:00:12.620> volume<00:00:12.950> swell

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:13.340 
anything fancy so this is volume swell

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:24.760 
anything fancy so this is volume swell
in<00:00:13.519> action<00:00:23.020> just<00:00:24.020> to<00:00:24.110> give<00:00:24.260> you<00:00:24.380> a<00:00:24.440> point<00:00:24.619> of

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:24.770 
in action just to give you a point of

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:26.109 
in action just to give you a point of
reference<00:00:24.830> this<00:00:25.369> is<00:00:25.430> what<00:00:25.699> it<00:00:25.820> sounds<00:00:25.970> like

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:26.119 
reference this is what it sounds like

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:34.440 
reference this is what it sounds like
without<00:00:26.390> volumes<00:00:26.960> for<00:00:27.170> actions

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:34.450 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:36.550 

so<00:00:35.450> what<00:00:35.600> we're<00:00:35.720> doing<00:00:35.750> in<00:00:36.020> principle<00:00:36.440> is

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:36.560 
so what we're doing in principle is

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.080 
so what we're doing in principle is
changing<00:00:37.040> the<00:00:37.160> envelope<00:00:37.490> of<00:00:37.610> the<00:00:37.790> guitar

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:38.090 
changing the envelope of the guitar

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:40.630 
changing the envelope of the guitar
sound<00:00:38.450> so<00:00:38.870> if<00:00:39.080> I<00:00:39.230> was<00:00:39.380> to<00:00:39.470> draw<00:00:39.680> this<00:00:39.830> out<00:00:40.040> that

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:40.640 
sound so if I was to draw this out that

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.240 
sound so if I was to draw this out that
picking<00:00:41.330> the<00:00:41.510> strings<00:00:41.870> would<00:00:42.650> actually<00:00:43.040> have

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:43.250 
picking the strings would actually have

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:45.400 
picking the strings would actually have
a<00:00:43.430> shot<00:00:43.489> attack<00:00:44.150> in<00:00:44.270> the<00:00:44.330> beginning<00:00:44.720> this<00:00:45.230> is

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:45.410 
a shot attack in the beginning this is

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:47.050 
a shot attack in the beginning this is
what<00:00:45.560> gives<00:00:45.680> the<00:00:45.800> guitar<00:00:46.130> is<00:00:46.280> twine<00:00:46.610> nature

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:47.060 
what gives the guitar is twine nature

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:49.000 
what gives the guitar is twine nature
now<00:00:47.690> with<00:00:47.900> the<00:00:48.020> volume<00:00:48.350> control<00:00:48.710> we<00:00:48.890> can

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.010 
now with the volume control we can

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:50.680 
now with the volume control we can
change<00:00:49.220> this<00:00:49.489> and<00:00:49.730> create<00:00:49.850> a<00:00:50.000> smooth<00:00:50.450> entry

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:50.690 
change this and create a smooth entry

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:53.140 
change this and create a smooth entry
similar<00:00:51.620> two<00:00:51.770> violins<00:00:52.129> and<00:00:52.250> cellos<00:00:52.610> hence<00:00:53.030> the

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:53.150 
similar two violins and cellos hence the

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:55.869 
similar two violins and cellos hence the
other<00:00:53.300> alternative<00:00:53.870> name<00:00:54.020> of<00:00:54.140> vile<00:00:54.350> inning<00:00:54.879> so

00:00:55.869 --> 00:00:55.879 
other alternative name of vile inning so

00:00:55.879 --> 00:00:57.820 
other alternative name of vile inning so
before<00:00:56.180> we<00:00:56.360> go<00:00:56.809> down<00:00:56.989> to<00:00:57.140> the<00:00:57.170> process<00:00:57.620> we

00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:57.830 
before we go down to the process we

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:59.189 
before we go down to the process we
first<00:00:58.040> have<00:00:58.220> to<00:00:58.250> just<00:00:58.550> get<00:00:58.790> used<00:00:58.940> to

00:00:59.189 --> 00:00:59.199 
first have to just get used to

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:01.510 
first have to just get used to
controlling<00:01:00.199> the<00:01:00.440> volume<00:01:00.650> control<00:01:01.070> on<00:01:01.100> guitar

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:01.520 
controlling the volume control on guitar

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:04.660 
controlling the volume control on guitar
now<00:01:02.320> we're<00:01:03.320> not<00:01:03.500> going<00:01:03.770> to<00:01:03.890> be<00:01:04.010> grabbing<00:01:04.520> the

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:04.670 
now we're not going to be grabbing the

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:06.100 
now we're not going to be grabbing the
volume<00:01:04.910> control<00:01:05.270> and<00:01:05.360> turning<00:01:05.780> it<00:01:05.899> the

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:06.110 
volume control and turning it the

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:07.690 
volume control and turning it the
easiest<00:01:06.649> way<00:01:06.830> I<00:01:06.860> find<00:01:07.130> while<00:01:07.250> playing<00:01:07.490> is

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:07.700 
easiest way I find while playing is

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.420 
easiest way I find while playing is
actually<00:01:08.060> to<00:01:08.300> gently<00:01:09.080> slide<00:01:09.979> your<00:01:10.190> finger

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:10.430 
actually to gently slide your finger

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:12.790 
actually to gently slide your finger
along<00:01:10.490> the<00:01:10.759> von<00:01:10.910> control<00:01:11.390> and<00:01:11.630> the<00:01:12.050> upward<00:01:12.680> and

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:12.800 
along the von control and the upward and

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.620 
along the von control and the upward and
downward<00:01:12.830> motion<00:01:13.280> so<00:01:14.030> this<00:01:14.180> is<00:01:14.270> what<00:01:14.390> it<00:01:14.479> looks

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:14.630 
downward motion so this is what it looks

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:18.430 
downward motion so this is what it looks
like<00:01:15.640> volume<00:01:16.640> all<00:01:16.729> the<00:01:16.759> way<00:01:16.820> off<00:01:17.290> volume<00:01:18.290> one

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:18.440 
like volume all the way off volume one

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:22.180 
like volume all the way off volume one
way<00:01:18.649> on<00:01:19.060> volume<00:01:20.060> all<00:01:20.180> the<00:01:20.210> way<00:01:20.300> off<00:01:21.040> volume<00:01:22.040> all

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:22.190 
way on volume all the way off volume all

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:24.820 
way on volume all the way off volume all
the<00:01:22.220> way<00:01:22.340> on<00:01:22.990> and<00:01:23.990> what<00:01:24.110> we've<00:01:24.290> got<00:01:24.410> comfort<00:01:24.680> of

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:24.830 
the way on and what we've got comfort of

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:26.230 
the way on and what we've got comfort of
this<00:01:24.979> we<00:01:25.190> can<00:01:25.340> then<00:01:25.460> start<00:01:25.610> looking<00:01:26.030> at<00:01:26.149> the

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:26.240 
this we can then start looking at the

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.719 
this we can then start looking at the
overall<00:01:26.330> process<00:01:26.720> and<00:01:27.200> here<00:01:27.410> it<00:01:27.530> is<00:01:27.740> step<00:01:28.520> one

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:28.729 
overall process and here it is step one

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:32.230 
overall process and here it is step one
volume<00:01:29.479> all<00:01:29.600> the<00:01:29.630> way<00:01:29.690> off<00:01:30.190> step<00:01:31.190> 2<00:01:31.430> play<00:01:32.119> your

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.240 
volume all the way off step 2 play your

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.490 
volume all the way off step 2 play your
note<00:01:32.420> or<00:01:32.899> play<00:01:33.110> your<00:01:33.229> chord<00:01:33.470> then<00:01:34.399> lastly

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:35.500 
note or play your chord then lastly

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.620 
note or play your chord then lastly
bring<00:01:36.500> the<00:01:36.590> volume<00:01:36.710> back<00:01:36.920> up<00:01:36.979> again<00:01:37.369> so<00:01:38.299> the

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:38.630 
bring the volume back up again so the

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:41.050 
bring the volume back up again so the
trick<00:01:38.990> is<00:01:39.200> actually<00:01:39.680> to<00:01:39.799> start<00:01:40.040> playing<00:01:40.400> what

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:41.060 
trick is actually to start playing what

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:42.310 
trick is actually to start playing what
you<00:01:41.090> want<00:01:41.180> to<00:01:41.390> play<00:01:41.540> before<00:01:41.810> you<00:01:42.020> actually

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:42.320 
you want to play before you actually

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.350 
you want to play before you actually
want<00:01:42.590> it<00:01:42.710> to<00:01:42.860> sound<00:01:43.040> so<00:01:43.400> you<00:01:43.460> have<00:01:43.580> to<00:01:43.700> think<00:01:43.909> of

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:44.360 
want it to sound so you have to think of

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.050 
want it to sound so you have to think of
playing<00:01:44.780> these<00:01:44.960> things<00:01:45.260> in<00:01:45.380> advance<00:01:45.850> that<00:01:46.850> way

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:47.060 
playing these things in advance that way

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.690 
playing these things in advance that way
we<00:01:47.420> play<00:01:47.750> with<00:01:47.960> volume<00:01:48.260> off<00:01:48.440> you<00:01:48.920> then<00:01:49.220> bring

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:49.700 
we play with volume off you then bring

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.429 
we play with volume off you then bring
the<00:01:49.850> volume<00:01:50.030> up<00:01:50.299> when<00:01:50.659> you<00:01:50.780> actually<00:01:50.930> want<00:01:51.290> it

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:51.439 
the volume up when you actually want it

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:53.770 
the volume up when you actually want it
to<00:01:51.619> sound<00:01:51.799> so<00:01:52.790> the<00:01:52.939> only<00:01:53.090> real<00:01:53.150> tricky<00:01:53.600> part

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:53.780 
to sound so the only real tricky part

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:55.179 
to sound so the only real tricky part
you<00:01:53.869> may<00:01:53.990> come<00:01:54.200> across<00:01:54.229> is<00:01:54.680> actually<00:01:55.040> your

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:55.189 
you may come across is actually your

00:01:55.189 --> 00:01:56.500 
you may come across is actually your
picking<00:01:55.490> hand<00:01:55.520> having<00:01:55.880> to<00:01:56.060> jump<00:01:56.240> from<00:01:56.420> the

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:56.510 
picking hand having to jump from the

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:58.690 
picking hand having to jump from the
strengths<00:01:56.869> and<00:01:56.930> the<00:01:57.020> volume<00:01:57.229> control<00:01:57.700> however

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700 
strengths and the volume control however

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:00.100 
strengths and the volume control however
once<00:01:58.880> you<00:01:58.939> get<00:01:59.119> comfortable<00:01:59.150> with<00:01:59.540> that<00:01:59.720> you
