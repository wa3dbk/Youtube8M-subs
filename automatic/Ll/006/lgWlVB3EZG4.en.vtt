00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:01.390

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
from these long training rides so I

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.130 
from these long training rides so I
figured<00:01:06.610> that<00:01:06.760> I<00:01:06.880> should<00:01:06.910> try<00:01:07.660> and<00:01:07.720> join<00:01:07.930> them

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:08.140 
figured that I should try and join them

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:09.450 
figured that I should try and join them
and<00:01:08.320> I'd<00:01:08.410> also<00:01:08.590> seen<00:01:08.920> some<00:01:09.100> of<00:01:09.220> the<00:01:09.250> women

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:09.460 
and I'd also seen some of the women

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:12.090 
and I'd also seen some of the women
racing<00:01:10.150> and<00:01:10.510> thought<00:01:10.660> it<00:01:10.780> looked<00:01:10.900> easy<00:01:11.110> I<00:01:11.650> was

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:12.100 
racing and thought it looked easy I was

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:20.340 
racing and thought it looked easy I was
surprised<00:01:12.550> that<00:01:12.850> it<00:01:13.060> wasn't

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:20.350 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:23.380 

and<00:01:21.350> then<00:01:21.590> just<00:01:22.070> from<00:01:22.340> the<00:01:22.609> love<00:01:23.000> of<00:01:23.149> the<00:01:23.240> two

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:23.390 
and then just from the love of the two

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:26.020 
and then just from the love of the two
wheels<00:01:23.630> he<00:01:24.049> got<00:01:24.200> into<00:01:24.439> motorcycles<00:01:25.189> some
