00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:06.000
 rafa this the pre-season very 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:10.000
 different from the one of the tournament last yes good 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:13.130
 what is this for months 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.400
 he is from the beginning 

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:18.140
 It suits me to prepare well in the 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:21.769
 tournament 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:23.770
 if I finish very well in past terms 

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:26.830
 so good 

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:28.620
 try to stay at that level that 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:32.090
 we show 

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:32.090
 at the end of the past 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:39.390
 they are reinforcements of quality reinforcements that 

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:39.390
 I think they will help us 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:44.220
 to complement us to try to do 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:44.220
 a better team 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:49.420
 the teacher knows very well what it is that 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:52.270
 it is missing and what it was that asked what 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:53.890
 that they gave him and I think he's very 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:56.620
 happy and we also have 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:01:01.150
 this type of players now yes but 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:05.020
 well I think the teacher already came 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:07.090
 seeing the case for some time 

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:09.479
 of Elijah for example maybe he did not have 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:13.630
 so many participations in tigers but 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:16.180
 no one doubts its quality so why 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:18.219
 now he has a new challenge now he has 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:20.619
 a new opportunity because here what 

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:22.780
 We will help you to be at your best 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:26.000
 level the clearest example is how 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:30.070
 we finished the last tournament 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.070
 maybe that's how we still lack 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:36.060
 make bad moves the team 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:39.360
 I always show an attitude that requires effort 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:42.360
 sacrifice but he missed nothing more 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:46.080
 putting the goals and this season is 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:49.970
 try to realize that norway I think 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:53.640
 that has served me well this 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:57.000
 this have treated me for two formats that 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:59.070
 was the first to dose a little in 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.320
 the trainings and that helped me then to 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.990
 have a good tournament close I think that 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:08.610
 I found myself at a good level so I 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:10.170
 I think we will continue with that already in the 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.600
 My physical part has helped me 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.040
 pretty to find very well 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:17.890
 find very good level to not have 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:21.160
 discomfort especially the physical parts 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:24.780
 they pay me harm prejudices maybe in 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:27.160
 some injury so that's why 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.500
 we will keep for the other order of ideas 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:31.750
 5 the moment he lives, what is your 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:34.390
 the Mexican team opinion by the 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:36.490
 party facing at night in front 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:38.440
 at costa rica, you have had many 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:39.880
 confrontations of this nature what 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:43.450
 you think about the psychic moment and 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:45.880
 football soccer I think Mexico 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:48.760
 is bound to always win Aztec 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:50.980
 it's always about looking for the three 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:55.620
 points to take advantage of the locality of 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:55.620
 take advantage of the property in the hobby 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:01.420
 what is necessary also the three 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:03.920
 points right now to give you a little 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:09.099
 more tranquility 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:09.099
 to all the fans and well I think that 

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:15.910
 Mexico is not obligated to 

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:17.620
 Rafael worries what the selection was like 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:19.400
 neither being the beginning the cup 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:22.909
 Confederations 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:24.230
 well I think that today they have 

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:27.560
 that get the three points as of 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:30.110
 place looks good is played badly 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:33.060
 maybe not in mexico so this is not 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:35.130
 has that clarity of forward 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:37.260
 the criticisms that have been made but good 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:39.540
 I think he has a lot of players 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.860
 quality to the front that can 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:42.300
 unbalance what can the 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:44.640
 difference 

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:45.750
 that can change the course of the game 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:48.450
 the story says that against rivals 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:50.280
 strong in the role of those who come 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:53.310
 the genital confederations with Brazil 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:55.920
 Mexico will grow yeah yeah of course I 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:58.620
 has touched live it and this and if I believe 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:01.890
 that mexico face great teams 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:04.860
 always makes show the best of each 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:07.670
 player and here in Mexico so I wish 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:11.310
 that this is the case and that I can give 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:13.500
 in this selection are not the ones that this 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:16.920
 year I think the one that decides is the 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:19.260
 coach and is who 

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:24.230
 so who chooses the best ones because 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:24.230
 there is our life 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:30.170
 well this lack of clarity nothing more 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:32.590
 I think the team has defensively 

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:34.990
 shown very well are you 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:37.370
 in good condition but ahead is 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:40.210
 what was better 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:44.529
 We have lacked a little bit of 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:46.659
 more arrival of more forcefulness 

00:04:44.529 --> 00:04:49.900
 I believe being in that position 

00:04:46.659 --> 00:04:52.479
 any coach any coach 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:54.900
 the pressure and the obligation to take 

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:54.900
 good results 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:06.699
 I keep working on my team this 

00:05:04.129 --> 00:05:10.069
 doing a good role with my team 

00:05:06.699 --> 00:05:11.869
 they call well if I do not have more time to 

00:05:10.069 --> 00:05:14.659
 being with my family is what maybe 

00:05:11.869 --> 00:05:18.889
 Today I am grateful that I did not have 

00:05:14.659 --> 00:05:21.469
 for example now on vacation I was 

00:05:18.889 --> 00:05:23.479
 with my children enjoying the most 

00:05:21.469 --> 00:05:26.509
 and before then maybe I did not have 

00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:28.580
 time gets covered so I will continue 

00:05:26.509 --> 00:05:31.119
 working and if I'm fine if it's not 

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:31.119
 best
