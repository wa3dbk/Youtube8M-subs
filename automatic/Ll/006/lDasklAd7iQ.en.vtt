00:00:01.089 --> 00:00:04.890
 we immediately define what the realities of the polyphonic choir rude the fact 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.830
 world professionals but amateurs like people like me 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:11.779
 a completely different profession 

00:00:11.779 --> 00:00:15.619
 and that, however, are found two or three times a week depending on the 

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:18.979
 gay need to try and try again 

00:00:19.579 --> 00:00:25.329
 many of us don't know music so they learn just like the little button 

00:00:25.329 --> 00:00:26.409
 home 

00:00:26.409 --> 00:00:27.210
 100 photos 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.079
 more hours of tests 

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:33.450
 someone, on the other hand, especially the younger ones also know music because they are 

00:00:33.449 --> 00:00:34.630
 guys that 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:38.250
 who have studied at the local music school of lugia and therefore have 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.020
 learned maybe they did that some theory exam and solfeggio then them 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:44.970
 they are much more advantaged also in learning 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:50.810
 and yet all I was was the sleep they work in the bank they are freelancers 

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:53.640
 lawyers of journalists engineers 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.050
 I believe it has something to do with me, teachers, in short, all tremendous 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.060
 &amp; lt 

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:03.000
 hd common cell to the denomination or those that make us get together this 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.210
 passion for choral singing is not easy however one 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.740
 no surely because he must think that 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:13.390
 just find out how you said square but the fact of learning stoically ad 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:18.220
 ear, not a pearl by imitation, certainly very long instincts 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:22.420
 and therefore work and May hours are in the face many separate tests in such a way 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:26.300
 that everyone can calmly study their part even with work 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:27.070
 single 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:28.570
 there is a singer for runners 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:32.750
 and the choristers learn to sing as soloists making sure of their part 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:36.470
 so a very complex job, but one that is certainly a poet of the results 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:40.910
 trailer easy to say amateurs a bit in short can be misleading 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:42.070
 very first 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:46.330
 behind there is a job then professionals do not say that amateurs 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:50.330
 in the sense of an own l under over there is to people who are not 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:53.590
 profession of the now queen professionals who do it out of passion 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:56.549
 I always say polyphonic is done by amateur who have an attitude 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:01.009
 professional, that is, a year they give a commitment 

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:05.299
 eeeeh very very intense perra to learn to study then 

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:10.030
 the attitude and professional but not from say we are singers here are the 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:13.960
 people like evaluating acrylic pierpaolo meadow that preceded the choir 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:16.059
 polyphonic of ruda the journalist 

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:21.879
 and of the regional loop here acquires as how it reconciles work as it can 

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:25.719
 also be an emblematic example of what you can do the same. 

00:02:25.719 --> 00:02:29.509
 atelier of clothes this is a bit my fundamental problem that we have a 

00:02:29.509 --> 00:02:33.619
 all in the sense that he reads at the source at the base of everything there is a big one 

00:02:33.619 --> 00:02:36.299
 passion to calculate with the day before 

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:41.559
 and therefore the passion for choral singing means that for example some days of 

00:02:41.559 --> 00:02:43.649
 holiday week you speak instead 

00:02:43.649 --> 00:02:47.519
 with your family or this story with photos we took 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:50.019
 from your home history 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:50.929
 wedding 

00:02:50.929 --> 00:02:52.649
 Comanducci 

00:02:52.649 --> 00:02:58.499
 I said he dedicates himself. holidays are also dedicated to choral activity 

00:02:58.499 --> 00:03:01.919
 because when you go to the competition when you go to an international event yes 

00:03:01.919 --> 00:03:02.379
 needs to 

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:07.599
 and staying away for 5 6 or 7 days it is clear that you have to take flower holidays 

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:12.890
 planning the work in time knowing that I don't play in June will go to work 

00:03:12.889 --> 00:03:16.330
 that September contest this land marks the hour 1 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:18.170
 the beginning of the year is organized 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:22.120
 so as to try as far as possible to accommodate those who are 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:27.500
 they heard comment commentary many thanks 19 pom. a typical program of 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:28.479
 this year 

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:32.779
 what programs do you have but we have and in the meantime two really much programs 

00:03:32.779 --> 00:03:36.229
 important that are the competition that we will face in the June underworld 

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:40.399
 and then in October we will be there photo lab of the international competition 

00:03:40.399 --> 00:03:43.399
 for the choir master mariele ventre that is 

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:48.569
 the doors of the granita romance that then you will never have to bring to them 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:49.850
 then contest then 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:53.270
 we will be at the disposal of these means are however very important teeth 

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:56.709
 because in short they are. with activity programs 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:00.509
 and then we have always flushed the concert life, however, the various ones 

00:04:00.509 --> 00:04:06.409
 the polyphonic organizes bicyclic are now exactly sime Lime music 

00:04:06.409 --> 00:04:08.680
 just because it is imminent with organ 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:10.199
 Summer night 

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:13.419
 we have different let's say concert cycle done there 

00:04:13.419 --> 00:04:14.289
 if yes, then 

00:04:14.289 --> 00:04:18.109
 contract we are about say about thirty little summer concerts one 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:19.790
 thirty users are 

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:24.360
 not only were you a true friend, so are you, but yourself, taking into account that of these 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:30.510
 30 let's say 5 or 6 are abroad here dakar indicatively now for example 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:35.580
 last year we also made important trips to Greece presents for 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:36.820
 say short data neither 

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:40.009
 if I participated in the cntro, I intended to do competitions 

00:04:40.009 --> 00:04:42.010
 the international review of athens 

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:45.280

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:55.680
 bologna region but also abroad and then also in the Veneto region of Verona 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:58.740
 then we will remember many awards for songs because I am 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:03.180
 important also to then give the right value to the activity of this 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:05.520
 of this corm I wanted to hear 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:09.439
