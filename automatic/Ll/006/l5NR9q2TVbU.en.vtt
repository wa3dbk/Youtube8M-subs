direction<00:00:19.939> for<00:00:20.560> rope<00:00:21.560> poles<00:00:21.859> would<00:00:22.100> work<00:00:22.369> our

00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:22.939 
direction for rope poles would work our

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:25.300 
direction for rope poles would work our
land<00:00:23.779> situation<00:00:24.590> where<00:00:24.769> we're<00:00:24.920> pulling<00:00:25.130> on

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:25.310 
land situation where we're pulling on

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:28.390 
land situation where we're pulling on
rope<00:00:25.550> is<00:00:25.730> not<00:00:26.060> exactly<00:00:26.960> where<00:00:27.740> we're<00:00:28.070> going<00:00:28.099> to

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:28.400 
rope is not exactly where we're going to

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.609 
rope is not exactly where we're going to
be<00:00:28.550> bringing<00:00:29.119> invitation<00:00:29.900> so<00:00:30.320> we<00:00:30.410> have<00:00:30.529> to

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:30.619 
be bringing invitation so we have to

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:32.530 
be bringing invitation so we have to
have<00:00:30.710> a<00:00:30.800> right<00:00:30.949> angle<00:00:31.160> change<00:00:31.609> can<00:00:31.970> use<00:00:32.180> it<00:00:32.360> to

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:32.540 
have a right angle change can use it to

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:34.630 
have a right angle change can use it to
help<00:00:33.140> direct<00:00:33.379> the<00:00:33.559> road<00:00:33.710> back<00:00:33.980> to<00:00:34.010> shore<00:00:34.370> we

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:34.640 
help direct the road back to shore we

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.210 
help direct the road back to shore we
have<00:00:34.879> a<00:00:34.910> good<00:00:35.150> safe<00:00:35.420> zone<00:00:35.690> too<00:00:36.080> you<00:00:36.830> can<00:00:36.949> use<00:00:36.979> it

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:37.220 
have a good safe zone too you can use it

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:39.490 
have a good safe zone too you can use it
as<00:00:37.339> a<00:00:37.370> mobile<00:00:37.640> anchor<00:00:38.360> point<00:00:38.629> so<00:00:39.170> when<00:00:39.350> we're

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:39.500 
as a mobile anchor point so when we're

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.310 
as a mobile anchor point so when we're
on<00:00:39.710> the<00:00:39.949> ice<00:00:40.100> and<00:00:40.909> a<00:00:41.089> long-distance<00:00:41.600> rescue

on the ice and a long-distance rescue

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.250 
on the ice and a long-distance rescue
let's<00:00:43.250> say<00:00:43.370> we<00:00:43.489> have<00:00:43.610> 2000<00:00:44.299> feet<00:00:44.479> of<00:00:44.659> ice<00:00:44.900> to<00:00:45.110> go

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:45.260 
let's say we have 2000 feet of ice to go

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.049 
let's say we have 2000 feet of ice to go
out<00:00:45.409> and<00:00:45.769> then<00:00:45.890> finally<00:00:46.339> we<00:00:46.549> have<00:00:46.699> our<00:00:46.879> last

00:00:47.049 --> 00:00:47.059 
out and then finally we have our last

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:49.479 
out and then finally we have our last
200<00:00:47.659> feet<00:00:47.839> it's<00:00:48.080> bad<00:00:48.379> ice<00:00:48.620> we<00:00:49.129> can<00:00:49.280> put<00:00:49.460> a

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:49.489 
200 feet it's bad ice we can put a

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:52.509 
200 feet it's bad ice we can put a
secure<00:00:49.909> anchors<00:00:50.360> up<00:00:50.570> and<00:00:51.100> secure<00:00:52.100> our<00:00:52.129> ropes

00:00:52.509 --> 00:00:52.519 
secure anchors up and secure our ropes

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:55.390 
secure anchors up and secure our ropes
to<00:00:53.089> them<00:00:53.239> to<00:00:53.540> the<00:00:53.720> ice<00:00:54.049> you<00:00:54.860> take<00:00:55.040> a<00:00:55.070> look<00:00:55.309> at

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:55.400 
to them to the ice you take a look at

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.490 
to them to the ice you take a look at
how<00:00:55.549> they're<00:00:55.760> placed<00:00:56.030> in<00:00:56.210> the<00:00:56.269> ice<00:00:56.420> first<00:00:57.320> of

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:57.500 
how they're placed in the ice first of

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:01.650 
how they're placed in the ice first of
all

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:01.660 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:04.300 

the<00:01:02.660> more<00:01:02.870> blue<00:01:03.200> the<00:01:03.380> ice<00:01:03.530> the<00:01:03.800> better<00:01:04.010> the

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:04.310 
the more blue the ice the better the

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:06.100 
the more blue the ice the better the
more<00:01:04.460> secure<00:01:04.880> it's<00:01:05.000> going<00:01:05.180> to<00:01:05.240> be<00:01:05.420> if<00:01:05.900> it's

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:06.110 
more secure it's going to be if it's

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:08.020 
more secure it's going to be if it's
quite<00:01:06.350> like<00:01:06.590> this<00:01:06.830> it<00:01:07.100> could<00:01:07.280> have<00:01:07.790> a<00:01:07.850> high

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:08.030 
quite like this it could have a high

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:09.850 
quite like this it could have a high
degree<00:01:08.240> of<00:01:08.420> oxygen<00:01:09.020> it's<00:01:09.230> going<00:01:09.260> to<00:01:09.410> fracture

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:09.860 
degree of oxygen it's going to fracture

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.820 
degree of oxygen it's going to fracture
it<00:01:09.890> easy<00:01:10.220> make<00:01:11.060> sure<00:01:11.300> that<00:01:11.540> your<00:01:12.320> ice<00:01:12.500> screws

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:12.830 
it easy make sure that your ice screws

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:17.490 
it easy make sure that your ice screws
are<00:01:13.450> reasonably<00:01:14.860> sharp<00:01:15.860> and<00:01:16.340> good<00:01:16.670> to<00:01:16.790> put<00:01:17.000> in

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:17.500 
are reasonably sharp and good to put in

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.260 
are reasonably sharp and good to put in
respect<00:01:18.500> for<00:01:18.560> tips<00:01:18.890> when<00:01:19.700> you<00:01:19.790> start<00:01:20.030> putting

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.270 
respect for tips when you start putting

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.210 
respect for tips when you start putting
it<00:01:20.510> in<00:01:20.660> you<00:01:21.350> don't<00:01:21.470> want<00:01:21.680> to<00:01:21.740> hammer<00:01:21.980> these

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:22.220 
it in you don't want to hammer these

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:25.390 
it in you don't want to hammer these
these<00:01:22.460> are<00:01:22.640> screw<00:01:23.030> in<00:01:23.240> ice<00:01:23.510> groups<00:01:24.160> so<00:01:25.160> when

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:25.400 
these are screw in ice groups so when

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:26.920 
these are screw in ice groups so when
you<00:01:25.490> start<00:01:25.760> them<00:01:26.000> you're<00:01:26.510> going<00:01:26.600> to<00:01:26.690> put<00:01:26.840> them

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:26.930 
you start them you're going to put them

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:29.920 
you start them you're going to put them
in<00:01:27.050> at<00:01:27.170> the<00:01:27.200> base<00:01:27.550> hold<00:01:28.550> the<00:01:28.700> base<00:01:28.910> let's<00:01:29.720> start

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:29.930 
in at the base hold the base let's start

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:32.380 
in at the base hold the base let's start
to<00:01:30.050> turn<00:01:30.230> it<00:01:30.410> by<00:01:30.530> hand<00:01:30.830> hold<00:01:31.820> the<00:01:31.880> base<00:01:32.120> so<00:01:32.330> it

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:32.390 
to turn it by hand hold the base so it

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:34.380 
to turn it by hand hold the base so it
doesn't<00:01:32.720> wobble

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:34.390 
doesn't wobble

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:37.289 
doesn't wobble
you'll<00:01:34.810> feel<00:01:35.020> the<00:01:35.170> ice<00:01:35.320> screws<00:01:35.590> start<00:01:35.890> to<00:01:36.040> grip

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:37.299 
you'll feel the ice screws start to grip

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:40.499 
you'll feel the ice screws start to grip
now<00:01:37.840> this<00:01:38.109> is<00:01:38.229> catching<00:01:38.740> and<00:01:39.729> as<00:01:40.119> it<00:01:40.299> goes<00:01:40.479> you

00:01:40.499 --> 00:01:40.509 
now this is catching and as it goes you

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:43.109 
now this is catching and as it goes you
can<00:01:40.869> use<00:01:41.079> the<00:01:41.289> top<00:01:41.530> leaver<00:01:42.219> like<00:01:42.549> brace<00:01:42.850> and<00:01:43.090> a

00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:43.119 
can use the top leaver like brace and a

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:44.580 
can use the top leaver like brace and a
bit

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:44.590 
bit

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:47.340 
bit
and<00:01:44.979> you<00:01:45.850> want<00:01:46.060> to<00:01:46.180> bring<00:01:46.390> it<00:01:46.479> down<00:01:46.689> as<00:01:47.020> far<00:01:47.320> as

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:47.350 
and you want to bring it down as far as

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:51.090 
and you want to bring it down as far as
you<00:01:47.560> can<00:01:47.920> into<00:01:48.700> the<00:01:48.850> ice<00:01:49.560> that's<00:01:50.560> right<00:01:50.799> now<00:01:50.950> if

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:51.100 
you can into the ice that's right now if

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.310 
you can into the ice that's right now if
you<00:01:51.250> clip<00:01:51.490> into<00:01:51.790> this<00:01:51.939> this<00:01:52.390> possibility

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:53.320 
you clip into this this possibility

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:55.529 
you clip into this this possibility
that's<00:01:54.039> going<00:01:54.340> to<00:01:54.430> come<00:01:54.549> out<00:01:54.670> or<00:01:55.060> if<00:01:55.390> it's

00:01:55.529 --> 00:01:55.539 
that's going to come out or if it's

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:57.779 
that's going to come out or if it's
super<00:01:55.720> cold<00:01:56.110> you<00:01:56.710> could<00:01:56.920> actually<00:01:57.130> fracture

00:01:57.779 --> 00:01:57.789 
super cold you could actually fracture

00:01:57.789 --> 00:01:59.460 
super cold you could actually fracture
the<00:01:57.970> screw<00:01:58.270> pulling<00:01:58.960> here<00:01:59.140> because<00:01:59.320> it's

00:01:59.460 --> 00:01:59.470 
the screw pulling here because it's

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:02.100 
the screw pulling here because it's
going<00:01:59.619> to<00:01:59.680> put<00:01:59.860> a<00:01:59.890> vector<00:02:00.159> angle<00:02:00.759> on<00:02:00.990> so<00:02:01.990> we're

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:02.110 
going to put a vector angle on so we're

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:09.850 
going to put a vector angle on so we're
going<00:02:02.200> to<00:02:02.289> turn<00:02:02.380> it<00:02:02.439> right<00:02:02.560> down<00:02:02.860> into<00:02:03.100> the<00:02:03.189> ice

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.610 

you<00:02:10.340> see<00:02:10.640> the<00:02:11.570> ice<00:02:11.750> is<00:02:11.960> coming<00:02:12.110> up<00:02:12.350> through<00:02:12.530> the

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
you see the ice is coming up through the

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:13.990 
you see the ice is coming up through the
top<00:02:12.800> and<00:02:12.860> the<00:02:13.040> screw<00:02:13.280> is<00:02:13.460> clean<00:02:13.700> itself

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
top and the screw is clean itself

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:25.589 
top and the screw is clean itself
cleaning<00:02:14.420> itself<00:02:14.750> as<00:02:14.960> we<00:02:15.170> put<00:02:15.380> it<00:02:15.470> in<00:02:15.590> guys

00:02:25.589 --> 00:02:25.599 

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:27.330 

when<00:02:26.049> I<00:02:26.170> put<00:02:26.409> the<00:02:26.500> hanger<00:02:26.890> where<00:02:27.219> the

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
when I put the hanger where the

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:28.860 
when I put the hanger where the
carabiner<00:02:27.760> is<00:02:27.909> going<00:02:28.120> it<00:02:28.239> out<00:02:28.329> push<00:02:28.629> to<00:02:28.840> the

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
carabiner is going it out push to the

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:30.610 
carabiner is going it out push to the
ice

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
ice

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:32.660 
ice
and

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
and

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.990 
and
attach<00:02:33.210> your<00:02:33.420> carabiner

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.680 

now<00:02:38.000> you<00:02:38.060> can<00:02:38.360> attach<00:02:38.600> pulley<00:02:39.020> or<00:02:39.740> a<00:02:39.770> rope

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
now you can attach pulley or a rope

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:43.290 
now you can attach pulley or a rope
through<00:02:41.690> running<00:02:42.050> through<00:02:42.230> the<00:02:42.380> carabiner<00:02:42.830> or

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:43.300 
through running through the carabiner or

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:47.050 
through running through the carabiner or
your<00:02:44.300> change<00:02:44.690> of<00:02:44.870> direction
