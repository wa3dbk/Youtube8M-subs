00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:06.870
 this is the acer aspire e500 7137 sr 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.030
 it is a 15.6 inch laptop with one 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.050
 push i3 processor and 4 gigabytes 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.430
 random access memory 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.300
 obviously to make excellent 

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:13.470
 for the daily things like 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.840
 for example office and in the net 

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:17.490
 efficient editing view photos 

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:19.560
 of all kinds of multimedia and the 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.640
 playing a simple games 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.749
 if you first have a look at it 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.429
 then we see that he meets the 

00:00:21.749 --> 00:00:25.589
 top fabricated system gray silver 

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:27.179
 plastic with the horizontal bridge 

00:00:25.589 --> 00:00:28.980
 swearing body fit keeps nice and tight 

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:30.720
 from the bottom is that of a mat 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.099
 black material and manufactures and also 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.289
 see the battery replacements from 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.820
 of course it is nice to know 

00:00:34.289 --> 00:00:39.090
 he is 3 comma zero three centimeters 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.980
 things 2.5 kilos think of that very special 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.239
 is but that he is also not really suitable 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.370
 for use on the road 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.949
 he will of course fit effortlessly 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.420
 in a special briefcase or backpack 

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:49.649
 I on fencing will be an A4 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.019
 so you get an idea how 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.820
 large screen and actually 

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:54.899
 and if i put that on the edge of the best 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.280
 well then you will see that the 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.929
 side something where the spout just 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.600
 slightly less high but it gives him 

00:00:57.929 --> 00:01:01.469
 just nice space to work 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.899
 that the screen is in because it is a 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.370
 glossy adv that screen that means it 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.780
 very nice full bright colors 

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:08.130
 but also has a little more trouble 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.110
 of reflection than, for example, an anti 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.760
 glare screen at the top of it 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.620
 screen we want a hd webcam quite a bit 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.580
 is fine for example, Skype 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:16.080
 a numeric keypad to the side, the 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.820
 part is fine and has a nice in it 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.780
 the touchpad design project was allowed 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.070
 you don't like that I think there 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.270
 of course always to a person wired 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.500
 or a wireless mouse on the laptop 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.970
 to connect 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.740
 for example, blood and fire clue 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.090
 with which you also have other devices sister 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.320
 smartphone feather tablet can wireless 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.820
 link to the laptop 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.020
 and if you had no blood then 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.550
 He also took a quarter of an hour with the 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.410
 gram cards directly into the laptop stitch 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:35.940
 without needing cables 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:38.340
 of course he has wifi he has one 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:40.350
 VGA and HDMI port and thus creates one 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.540
 connect additional motor or mast from the TV 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.070
 At USB port the one time has three 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.930
 points a two times two mean 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.760
 just about that no dvd player and burn 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.290
 so you can't co your favorite 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:51.210
 burn and play 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.890
 for that you will really need external sources 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.540
 must purchase in the laptop in their 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.820
