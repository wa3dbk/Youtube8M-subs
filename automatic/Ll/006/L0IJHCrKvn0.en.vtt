00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:56.669 
on this they said that the crayon really
started<00:01:55.270> to<00:01:55.390> stink<00:01:55.750> and<00:01:56.050> I<00:01:56.110> didn't<00:01:56.350> believe<00:01:56.619> it

00:01:56.669 --> 00:01:56.679 
started to stink and I didn't believe it

00:01:56.679 --> 00:01:59.190 
started to stink and I didn't believe it
at<00:01:56.830> first<00:01:56.890> because<00:01:57.850> it<00:01:58.060> didn't<00:01:58.509> really<00:01:58.720> stink

00:01:59.190 --> 00:01:59.200 
at first because it didn't really stink

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.139 
at first because it didn't really stink
at<00:01:59.380> the<00:01:59.679> beginning<00:02:00.069> but<00:02:00.100> now<00:02:00.310> it's<00:02:00.640> true<00:02:00.819> I<00:02:01.000> got

00:02:01.139 --> 00:02:01.149 
at the beginning but now it's true I got

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:02.760 
at the beginning but now it's true I got
a<00:02:01.179> little<00:02:01.300> spanking<00:02:01.659> also<00:02:02.380> it<00:02:02.500> looks<00:02:02.619> like

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:02.770 
a little spanking also it looks like

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:06.570 
a little spanking also it looks like
that<00:02:03.159> not<00:02:03.490> only<00:02:03.700> is<00:02:04.200> the<00:02:05.200> paper<00:02:05.470> around<00:02:05.770> the

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:06.580 
that not only is the paper around the

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:10.199 
that not only is the paper around the
crayon<00:02:06.940> burning<00:02:07.450> but<00:02:08.259> also<00:02:08.440> the<00:02:09.429> top<00:02:09.729> of<00:02:10.000> the

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:10.209 
crayon burning but also the top of the

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:13.440 
crayon burning but also the top of the
actual<00:02:10.690> crayon<00:02:11.019> is<00:02:11.230> burning<00:02:11.620> so<00:02:12.310> maybe<00:02:13.269> you

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
actual crayon is burning so maybe you

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.920 
actual crayon is burning so maybe you
can<00:02:13.660> get<00:02:13.870> half<00:02:14.079> an<00:02:14.230> hour<00:02:14.410> out<00:02:14.739> of<00:02:14.769> it<00:02:15.070> if<00:02:15.280> you

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
can get half an hour out of it if you

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.800 
can get half an hour out of it if you
just<00:02:16.930> burn<00:02:17.260> the<00:02:17.470> top<00:02:17.650> crayon<00:02:18.280> boom<00:02:18.630> or<00:02:19.630> maybe

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
just burn the top crayon boom or maybe

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:25.050 
just burn the top crayon boom or maybe
not<00:02:22.110> just<00:02:23.110> why<00:02:23.290> you're<00:02:23.530> burning<00:02:24.040> fire<00:02:24.310> burning

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
not just why you're burning fire burning

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:30.050 
not just why you're burning fire burning

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
think this piece at the top here is

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:37.620 
think this piece at the top here is
gonna<00:02:35.680> fall<00:02:36.010> off<00:02:36.040> in<00:02:36.459> a<00:02:36.579> second<00:02:36.970> probably

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:37.630 
gonna fall off in a second probably

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:39.210 
gonna fall off in a second probably
scare<00:02:37.930> the<00:02:38.019> crap<00:02:38.200> out<00:02:38.380> of<00:02:38.410> me<00:02:38.620> cuz<00:02:38.799> that's<00:02:39.010> what

the last little piece did whoa okay
that's<00:02:44.470> enough<00:02:44.680> because<00:02:45.010> I<00:02:45.310> don't<00:02:45.730> want<00:02:45.970> to

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150

have this oops have this lovely souvenir
of<00:03:19.170> my<00:03:19.550> experiment<00:03:20.550> today<00:03:21.050> it's<00:03:22.050> fantastic<00:03:22.830> it

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
of my experiment today it's fantastic it

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:25.520 
of my experiment today it's fantastic it
didn't<00:03:23.790> burn<00:03:23.880> anywhere<00:03:24.240> close<00:03:24.870> to<00:03:24.900> half<00:03:25.350> an

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
didn't burn anywhere close to half an

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:28.430 
didn't burn anywhere close to half an
hour<00:03:25.650> long<00:03:26.010> so<00:03:26.880> I<00:03:27.270> would<00:03:27.510> say<00:03:27.780> if<00:03:28.020> you're<00:03:28.230> in<00:03:28.350> an

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
hour long so I would say if you're in an

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:32.060 
hour long so I would say if you're in an
emergency<00:03:28.920> situation<00:03:29.900> probably<00:03:30.900> a<00:03:31.260> candle<00:03:31.920> is

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:32.070 
emergency situation probably a candle is

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:34.820 
emergency situation probably a candle is
your<00:03:32.250> best<00:03:32.640> bet<00:03:32.840> yeah<00:03:33.840> I<00:03:33.870> can't<00:03:34.260> really<00:03:34.560> think

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:34.830 
your best bet yeah I can't really think

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:36.920 
your best bet yeah I can't really think
of<00:03:35.040> a<00:03:35.340> way<00:03:35.700> this<00:03:35.970> would<00:03:36.270> actually<00:03:36.540> be

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
of a way this would actually be

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.650 
of a way this would actually be
practical<00:03:37.740> unless<00:03:38.580> you<00:03:38.790> just<00:03:39.000> wanted<00:03:39.360> to<00:03:39.480> like

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660 
practical unless you just wanted to like

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:41.660 
practical unless you just wanted to like
impress<00:03:39.870> your<00:03:40.230> kids<00:03:40.530> or<00:03:40.740> something<00:03:41.190> because

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670 
impress your kids or something because

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:43.610 
impress your kids or something because
it<00:03:41.910> really<00:03:42.120> only<00:03:42.300> burned<00:03:42.660> for<00:03:42.959> like<00:03:43.110> less<00:03:43.380> than

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
it really only burned for like less than

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:47.000 
it really only burned for like less than
10<00:03:43.860> minutes<00:03:44.070> and<00:03:44.750> it<00:03:45.750> was<00:03:45.870> kind<00:03:46.110> of<00:03:46.380> stinky<00:03:46.830> and

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010 
10 minutes and it was kind of stinky and

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:49.430 
10 minutes and it was kind of stinky and
sort<00:03:47.790> of<00:03:47.850> dangerous<00:03:48.330> i<00:03:48.540> would<00:03:48.750> say<00:03:48.990> because

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
sort of dangerous i would say because

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.290 
sort of dangerous i would say because
you<00:03:49.680> know<00:03:49.800> tipped<00:03:50.220> over<00:03:50.400> and<00:03:50.580> set<00:03:50.880> the<00:03:51.030> plate

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:51.300 
you know tipped over and set the plate

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:54.890 
you know tipped over and set the plate
on<00:03:51.450> fire<00:03:51.780> so<00:03:52.260> that<00:03:52.590> was<00:03:53.070> like<00:03:53.100> your<00:03:53.820> hand<00:03:54.240> you

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:54.900 
on fire so that was like your hand you

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:57.229 
on fire so that was like your hand you
would<00:03:55.110> be<00:03:55.290> in<00:03:55.410> trouble<00:03:55.489> burn<00:03:56.489> crams<00:03:56.880> if<00:03:57.120> you

00:03:57.229 --> 00:03:57.239 
would be in trouble burn crams if you

00:03:57.239 --> 00:03:59.930 
would be in trouble burn crams if you
