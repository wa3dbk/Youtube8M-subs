next three or four weeks that was always
something<00:00:29.600> that<00:00:29.810> I<00:00:29.869> look<00:00:30.050> forward<00:00:30.290> to<00:00:30.440> and<00:00:30.619> I

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:30.680 
something that I look forward to and I

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.100 
something that I look forward to and I
gravitated<00:00:31.160> towards<00:00:31.460> those<00:00:31.580> days<00:00:32.110> the

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:33.110 
gravitated towards those days the

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:34.930

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.049 
they taught about putting an apron on
there's<00:00:36.890> so<00:00:37.010> much<00:00:37.070> more<00:00:37.309> to<00:00:37.370> being<00:00:37.520> a<00:00:37.610> chef<00:00:37.850> and

00:00:38.049 --> 00:00:38.059

fahrenheit<00:00:42.240> for<00:00:42.450> me<00:00:42.600> I<00:00:42.780> think<00:00:43.020> it's<00:00:43.170> it's<00:00:43.770> a

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
fahrenheit for me I think it's it's a

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.770 
fahrenheit for me I think it's it's a
lot<00:00:44.070> of<00:00:44.160> the<00:00:44.220> best<00:00:44.400> of<00:00:44.550> both<00:00:44.640> worlds<00:00:45.090> that<00:00:45.600> may

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
lot of the best of both worlds that may

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.320 
lot of the best of both worlds that may
be<00:00:45.840> a<00:00:45.989> simple<00:00:46.560> sandwich<00:00:47.100> or<00:00:47.310> a<00:00:47.340> salad<00:00:47.460> or<00:00:48.000> soup
