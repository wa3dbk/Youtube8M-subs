00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:12.840
 in this video we will see this 

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:12.840
 what is a karyotype and how to study it 

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:19.850
 so first of all we'll see 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:21.880
 how does one realize karyotype is this 

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:24.189
 that if 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:26.829
 to perform a karyotype we begin 

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:29.259
 to prepare the lock by blocking its 

00:00:26.829 --> 00:00:32.259
 chromosomes at the moment they are 

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:35.230
 visible and double then burst 

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:39.449
 the core is colored and 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:42.460
 microscope on suitcases a photograph 

00:00:39.449 --> 00:00:43.890
 of the entire core content of a 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:49.470
 cell 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:53.739
 this photograph is karyotyped then 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:58.449
 we can cut out each of the chromosomes 

00:00:53.739 --> 00:01:00.280
 to sort them order them and 

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:03.780
 stick on a sheet then we get 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:03.780
 an ordered karyotype 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:12.450
 here is an ordered karyotype we observe 

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:15.009
 chromosomes it's crozon its double 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.810
 you have to be careful both 

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:18.460
 chromatic actually stuck one to 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:20.530
 the other which does not necessarily 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:23.890
 the impression of having a chromosome and 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:25.750
 yet this is the case when 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:28.750
 cut out our chromosomes 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:31.600
 we realize that in reality at each 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:34.090
 times at the bar where to find two chromosomes 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:36.610
 identical so to achieve a 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:39.250
 ordered karyotype we will sort and put 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:40.420
 together those identical chromosomes that 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:41.640
 will therefore form pairs of 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:44.799
 chromosomes 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:48.340
 then we put our pairs of chromosomes 

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:50.319
 from the largest to the smallest and to 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:54.610
 locate in the karyotype the oval is 

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:56.049
 numbered from the largest to the smallest 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:58.030
 we stay at the end a pair of 

00:01:56.049 --> 00:02:00.189
 chromosomes a bit special for 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:04.929
 which one will put letters x or 

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:07.860
 and y for whom corresponds to 

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:07.860
 sex chromosomes 

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:14.940
 a CKOI karyotype and although it is a 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.710
 photograph that presents all of 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:19.290
 double chromosomes contained in the nucleus 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:22.400
 of a cell this curious type can be 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.400
 orderly or not 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:30.879
 so how do you recognize karyotype 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:30.879
 humans with a karyotype of another species 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:37.140
 here is a karyotype of the species 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:39.959
 chimpanzees if we count the number of 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:42.080
 pairs of crucibles that make up what 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:47.280
 happens to the types of this species 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:48.959
 we can count that we have 24 pairs of 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:55.620
 chromosomes 24 pairs of chromosomes 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:57.959
 48 digot for the human species if 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:00.060
 there are also the number of pairs of 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:01.829
 chromosomes observed in a pebble 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:05.190
 type of our species 

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:09.980
 this time there are 23 pairs of 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:09.980
 chromosomes either 46 chromosomes 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:17.060
 here are some examples of species with 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.709
 the number of chromosomes associated with 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:21.319
 each 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:23.890
 we see that each species has a 

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:26.840
 number of chromosomes peculiar to it 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:29.840
 46 chromosomes or 23 pairs of 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:32.599
 chromosomes so will be the number 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:34.900
 specific promos area of our 

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:34.900
 species 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:42.920
 a suffer from a karyotype how can one 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:42.920
 recognize the gender of the person 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:47.930
 here are two karyotypes on the karyotype of 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:48.650
 left on the observe for chromosomes 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:52.390
 sex 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:55.430
 two big chromosomes called xx 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:57.770
 on the right karyotype we observe a 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:04:02.890
 big chromosomes that's called promo 

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:05.209
 zoom x and y chromosome small 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:08.270
 when one has 22 pairs of chromosomes 

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:10.190
 and xx x this is a woman 

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:12.410
 and when one has 22 pairs of 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:15.200
 chromosomes xy 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:17.390
 this is a man our three pairs 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:20.859
 of chromosomes being the number of pairs 

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:20.859
 of chromosomes of our species 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:26.849
 we remember that each cell of a 

00:04:24.599 --> 00:04:29.069
 individual of the human species possesses 23 

00:04:26.849 --> 00:04:31.080
 pairs of chromosomes 46 

00:04:29.069 --> 00:04:31.800
 chromosomes and that one of them is going 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:35.340
 present characteristics 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:37.229
 different according to sex in women 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:39.599
 we will have 22 more chromosome pairs 

00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:41.490
 as pairs of sex chromosomes xx x 

00:04:39.599 --> 00:04:43.259
 in men 22 pairs of 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:47.150
 chromosomes and as pairs of 

00:04:43.259 --> 00:04:47.150
 sex chromosomes xx y 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:54.500
 there are karyotype abnormalities 

00:04:55.200 --> 00:05:00.300
 on this karyotype we observe 23 pairs of 

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:03.420
 chromosomes so this is definitely a 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:05.940
 cardio type of a human species for 

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:08.220
 the sex chromosomes we have xy it 

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:09.810
 so is a man and if one 

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:11.670
 observe in more detail the pairs of 

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:12.990
 chromosomes one realizes that for the 

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:15.420
 pair number 21 

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:18.450
 instead of having two chromosomes we have 

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:21.630
 three so it's a trisomy tri 

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:23.790
 for 3 omitted for dig and it's more 

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:25.550
 precisely trisomy 21 since it 

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:28.020
 touches the pair number 21 

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:29.820
 individuals with this abnormality 

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:34.280
 presents characters that are going to be 

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:34.280
 different from non- sick individuals 

00:05:34.699 --> 00:05:39.479
 here is another karyotype of the species 

00:05:37.679 --> 00:05:42.779
 human since we have 23 pairs of 

00:05:39.479 --> 00:05:43.979
 chromosomes is innoncent no longer studies 

00:05:42.779 --> 00:05:47.069
 precisely the pair of chromosomes 

00:05:43.979 --> 00:05:47.939
 sex we realize here that one axx 

00:05:47.069 --> 00:05:50.579
 there 

00:05:47.939 --> 00:05:54.539
 again we have three chromosomes instead 

00:05:50.579 --> 00:05:57.479
 of two it is a trisomy the 

00:05:54.539 --> 00:06:00.239
 individuals who presents it's three 

00:05:57.479 --> 00:06:02.579
 Sex chromosomes have characters 

00:06:00.239 --> 00:06:07.309
 different from non- sick individuals 

00:06:02.579 --> 00:06:07.309
 this is klinefelter 

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:11.360
 this curious guy is always a 

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:13.310
 karyotype of human species since have 

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:15.650
 observed three pairs of chromosomes years 

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:17.180
 this time we see students studying 

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:18.770
 pairs of chromosomes at the level of 

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:21.740
 pair of sex chromosomes we have a 

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:23.600
 single chromosome one x chromosome 

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:26.660
 this is an anomaly 

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:29.600
 chromosome the mono me monod for a 

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:31.340
 friend for chromosomes the individuals 

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:33.170
 concerned you present characters 

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:37.720
 different from non- sick individuals 

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:37.720
 we have here turner syndrome years 

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:42.760
 it is noted that an abnormal number of 

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:44.740
 chromosomes prevents the development of 

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:48.910
 the embryo or will cause characters 

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:50.500
 different in the individual concerned 

00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:52.960
 holds that three chromosomes instead 

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:55.540
 of a pair it's called trisomy and 

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:59.490
 a chromosome of a pair of chromosomes 

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:59.490
 it's called a half mono
