00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
you're gonna be able to line up just

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.080 
you're gonna be able to line up just
using<00:01:08.130> this<00:01:08.939> little<00:01:09.180> tab<00:01:09.510> on<00:01:09.869> each<00:01:10.049> of<00:01:10.710> them

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:11.090 
using this little tab on each of them

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:13.460 
using this little tab on each of them
you<00:01:12.090> can<00:01:12.210> see<00:01:12.390> it<00:01:12.479> also<00:01:12.600> more<00:01:12.960> clearly<00:01:13.200> on<00:01:13.380> the

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
you can see it also more clearly on the

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.780 
you can see it also more clearly on the
paper<00:01:13.790> and<00:01:15.320> then<00:01:16.320> that<00:01:16.470> will<00:01:16.680> line<00:01:17.040> up<00:01:17.070> with<00:01:17.430> a

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
paper and then that will line up with a

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.740 
paper and then that will line up with a
little<00:01:18.090> tab<00:01:18.299> on<00:01:18.330> the<00:01:19.320> inside<00:01:19.350> of<00:01:19.710> the<00:01:19.770> ring<00:01:19.920> and

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:20.750 
little tab on the inside of the ring and

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:28.130 
little tab on the inside of the ring and
so<00:01:21.750> first<00:01:22.110> unit<00:01:22.409> of<00:01:22.439> your<00:01:22.590> plastic

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.500 

then<00:01:29.140> the<00:01:29.260> paper<00:01:29.470> again<00:01:29.920> just<00:01:30.340> lining<00:01:30.760> up<00:01:30.909> this

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:31.510 
then the paper again just lining up this

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:43.260 
then the paper again just lining up this
tab<00:01:31.840> on<00:01:32.770> each<00:01:33.930> layer<00:01:41.610> and<00:01:42.610> then<00:01:42.820> finally<00:01:43.150> your

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:43.270 
tab on each layer and then finally your

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:45.270 
tab on each layer and then finally your
metal<00:01:43.510> let's<00:01:43.960> see<00:01:44.140> with<00:01:44.770> the<00:01:44.890> metal<00:01:45.130> one

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:45.280 
metal let's see with the metal one

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.910 
metal let's see with the metal one
there's<00:01:46.030> actually<00:01:46.390> a<00:01:46.420> locking<00:01:46.900> device<00:01:47.020> so

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:47.920 
there's actually a locking device so

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:49.170 
there's actually a locking device so
you're<00:01:48.040> gonna<00:01:48.130> slide<00:01:48.310> the<00:01:48.460> top<00:01:48.640> in<00:01:48.820> there<00:01:49.030> and

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:49.180 
you're gonna slide the top in there and

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:53.040 
you're gonna slide the top in there and
then<00:01:49.509> just<00:01:49.830> rotate<00:01:50.830> it<00:01:51.840> until<00:01:52.840> it<00:01:52.930> locks

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:53.050 
then just rotate it until it locks

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:56.490 
then just rotate it until it locks
underneath<00:01:53.500> and<00:01:54.780> then<00:01:55.780> all<00:01:56.050> you<00:01:56.140> have<00:01:56.229> to<00:01:56.350> do

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:56.500 
underneath and then all you have to do

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.160 
underneath and then all you have to do
is<00:01:56.910> take<00:01:57.910> this<00:01:58.090> time<00:01:58.420> which<00:01:58.690> is<00:01:58.810> facing

00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.170 
is take this time which is facing

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:02.219 
is take this time which is facing
outwards<00:01:59.530> on<00:01:59.710> the<00:01:59.890> bowel<00:02:00.759> ring<00:02:01.030> slide<00:02:01.930> it<00:02:02.050> into

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:02.229 
outwards on the bowel ring slide it into

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:03.749 
outwards on the bowel ring slide it into
a<00:02:02.259> hole<00:02:02.470> which<00:02:02.680> is<00:02:02.710> just<00:02:03.190> above<00:02:03.399> the<00:02:03.520> finger

00:02:03.749 --> 00:02:03.759 
a hole which is just above the finger

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:06.690 
a hole which is just above the finger
stop<00:02:03.940> and<00:02:04.600> put<00:02:04.780> it<00:02:04.869> down<00:02:04.960> and<00:02:05.280> then<00:02:06.280> just<00:02:06.340> do

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:06.700 
stop and put it down and then just do
