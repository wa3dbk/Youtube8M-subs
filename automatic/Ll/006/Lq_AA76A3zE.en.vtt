shade or two darker today I'm going to
share<00:00:15.179> some<00:00:15.330> information<00:00:15.360> on<00:00:15.870> how<00:00:16.020> well<00:00:16.230> is

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
share some information on how well is

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.029 
share some information on how well is
with<00:00:16.500> machines<00:00:16.890> and<00:00:17.130> a<00:00:18.080> few<00:00:19.080> tips<00:00:19.320> on<00:00:19.560> how<00:00:19.650> to

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
with machines and a few tips on how to

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.359 
with machines and a few tips on how to
make<00:00:20.250> a<00:00:20.279> really<00:00:20.550> nice<00:00:20.789> finish<00:00:21.240> in<00:00:21.390> this<00:00:21.510> wood

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:22.369 
make a really nice finish in this wood

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:24.890 
make a really nice finish in this wood
when<00:00:23.369> you<00:00:23.460> get<00:00:23.609> up<00:00:23.699> close<00:00:23.970> to<00:00:24.000> tropical<00:00:24.570> walnut

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
when you get up close to tropical walnut

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.870 
when you get up close to tropical walnut
you'll<00:00:25.350> notice<00:00:25.680> some<00:00:25.800> consistency<00:00:26.550> here<00:00:26.760> in

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
you'll notice some consistency here in

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.000 
you'll notice some consistency here in
both<00:00:27.420> how<00:00:27.599> straight<00:00:27.900> the<00:00:28.050> grain<00:00:28.230> is<00:00:28.439> and<00:00:28.650> in

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
both how straight the grain is and in

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.279 
both how straight the grain is and in
the<00:00:29.099> color<00:00:29.340> so<00:00:30.029> you'll<00:00:30.210> almost<00:00:30.420> never<00:00:30.660> find<00:00:31.109> a

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
the color so you'll almost never find a

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.049 
the color so you'll almost never find a
pale<00:00:31.529> SAP<00:00:31.830> wood<00:00:32.040> and<00:00:32.219> tropical<00:00:32.610> walnut<00:00:32.910> and

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
pale SAP wood and tropical walnut and

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.630 
pale SAP wood and tropical walnut and
you<00:00:33.750> won't<00:00:33.930> get<00:00:34.260> the<00:00:34.530> the<00:00:34.860> curl<00:00:35.160> and<00:00:35.520> the

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
you won't get the the curl and the

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.700 
you won't get the the curl and the
swirling<00:00:35.940> and<00:00:36.390> irregular<00:00:36.989> grain<00:00:37.290> that<00:00:37.559> you're

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
swirling and irregular grain that you're

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.229 
swirling and irregular grain that you're
going<00:00:37.829> to<00:00:37.890> find<00:00:38.129> in<00:00:38.340> something<00:00:38.640> like<00:00:38.760> American

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
going to find in something like American

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.030 
going to find in something like American
black<00:00:39.420> walnut<00:00:39.840> it's<00:00:40.290> still<00:00:40.590> great<00:00:40.829> to<00:00:40.860> work

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
black walnut it's still great to work

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.920 
black walnut it's still great to work
with<00:00:41.100> and<00:00:41.399> it<00:00:41.879> finishes<00:00:42.300> beautifully<00:00:44.930> this

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
with and it finishes beautifully this

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.990 
with and it finishes beautifully this
wood<00:00:46.140> machines<00:00:46.530> pretty<00:00:46.950> easily<00:00:47.250> so<00:00:47.850> your

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
wood machines pretty easily so your

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.490 
wood machines pretty easily so your
usual<00:00:48.329> woodworking<00:00:48.750> blades<00:00:48.989> and<00:00:49.200> cutters

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
usual woodworking blades and cutters

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.350 
usual woodworking blades and cutters
they'll<00:00:49.950> do<00:00:50.129> just<00:00:50.430> fine<00:00:52.489> for<00:00:53.489> example<00:00:53.969> take<00:00:54.329> a

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
they'll do just fine for example take a

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.479 
they'll do just fine for example take a
look<00:00:54.539> at<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:54.690> edge<00:00:54.870> left<00:00:55.230> by<00:00:55.440> this<00:00:55.500> 62<00:00:56.160> cross

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
look at the edge left by this 62 cross

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.420 
look at the edge left by this 62 cross
cut<00:00:56.699> blade

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.400 

but<00:00:59.850> the<00:01:00.000> same<00:01:00.180> goes<00:01:00.360> for<00:01:00.420> routing<00:01:00.780> this<00:01:01.200> is<00:01:01.380> a

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
but the same goes for routing this is a

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:07.690 
but the same goes for routing this is a
3/8<00:01:01.920> inch<00:01:02.130> carbide<00:01:02.670> tipped<00:01:02.910> round<00:01:03.240> over<00:01:03.480> bit

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:07.700 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.820 

so<00:01:08.299> now<00:01:08.479> hopefully<00:01:08.659> you<00:01:09.020> can<00:01:09.170> see<00:01:09.470> that<00:01:09.500> this

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:09.830 
so now hopefully you can see that this

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:11.620 
so now hopefully you can see that this
wood<00:01:10.040> is<00:01:10.159> not<00:01:10.400> too<00:01:10.549> hard<00:01:10.850> and<00:01:11.119> yet<00:01:11.299> not<00:01:11.479> too

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:11.630 
wood is not too hard and yet not too

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:13.690 
wood is not too hard and yet not too
soft<00:01:11.960> and<00:01:12.229> that<00:01:12.560> it<00:01:12.680> machines<00:01:13.009> really<00:01:13.310> quite

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:13.700 
soft and that it machines really quite

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.749 
soft and that it machines really quite
well<00:01:14.229> so<00:01:15.229> next<00:01:15.470> let's<00:01:15.920> just<00:01:16.130> take<00:01:16.280> a<00:01:16.310> look<00:01:16.520> at<00:01:16.729> a

00:01:16.749 --> 00:01:16.759 
well so next let's just take a look at a

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:19.300 
well so next let's just take a look at a
few<00:01:17.030> finishes<00:01:17.570> that<00:01:17.990> you<00:01:18.229> can<00:01:18.409> do<00:01:18.560> that<00:01:19.159> really

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:19.310 
few finishes that you can do that really

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:21.070 
few finishes that you can do that really
make<00:01:19.549> this<00:01:19.670> would<00:01:19.909> look<00:01:20.060> great<00:01:20.240> so<00:01:20.810> look<00:01:20.960> at

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:21.080 
make this would look great so look at

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:22.719 
make this would look great so look at
these<00:01:21.170> samples<00:01:21.619> I<00:01:21.710> finished<00:01:22.040> each<00:01:22.250> one<00:01:22.549> with<00:01:22.700> a

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:22.729 
these samples I finished each one with a

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:24.730 
these samples I finished each one with a
different<00:01:22.820> product<00:01:23.390> yet<00:01:24.020> the<00:01:24.140> results<00:01:24.590> are

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:24.740 
different product yet the results are

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.010 
different product yet the results are
quite<00:01:24.860> similar<00:01:25.250> they're<00:01:25.880> just<00:01:26.090> sanded<00:01:26.390> 220

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:27.020 
quite similar they're just sanded 220

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:28.300 
quite similar they're just sanded 220
grit<00:01:27.200> and<00:01:27.440> then<00:01:27.799> finished<00:01:28.100> with<00:01:28.159> the

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:28.310 
grit and then finished with the

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:30.399 
grit and then finished with the
protective<00:01:28.820> topcoat<00:01:29.270> the<00:01:29.390> gel<00:01:29.479> polyurethane

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:30.409

simple<00:01:39.770> real<00:01:39.950> easy<00:01:40.069> to<00:01:40.340> do<00:01:40.490> so<00:01:40.970> I'm<00:01:41.030> not<00:01:41.119> going

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
simple real easy to do so I'm not going

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:42.730 
simple real easy to do so I'm not going
to<00:01:41.330> really<00:01:41.420> demonstrate<00:01:41.720> how<00:01:42.259> those<00:01:42.440> go<00:01:42.710> on

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:42.740 
to really demonstrate how those go on

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:44.410 
to really demonstrate how those go on
you<00:01:43.250> just<00:01:43.429> follow<00:01:43.640> the<00:01:43.729> directions<00:01:43.940> on<00:01:44.330> the

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
benefits number one the pores get filled

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.230 
benefits number one the pores get filled
with<00:01:57.020> material<00:01:57.229> and<00:01:57.770> therefore<00:01:58.340> your<00:01:58.940> topcoat

00:01:59.230 --> 00:01:59.240 
with material and therefore your topcoat

of<00:02:06.350> the<00:02:06.409> wood<00:02:06.470> you<00:02:07.250> add<00:02:07.490> a<00:02:07.520> little<00:02:07.729> bit<00:02:07.940> of

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:07.970 
of the wood you add a little bit of

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:10.600 
of the wood you add a little bit of
contrast<00:02:08.600> a<00:02:08.810> little<00:02:08.869> bit<00:02:09.140> more<00:02:09.380> dimension<00:02:09.890> to

method<00:02:17.180> we're<00:02:17.359> going<00:02:17.510> to<00:02:17.570> apply<00:02:17.750> a<00:02:17.810> Danish<00:02:18.200> oil

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380 
method we're going to apply a Danish oil

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:20.710 
method we're going to apply a Danish oil
and<00:02:18.590> then<00:02:18.950> wet<00:02:19.160> sand<00:02:19.489> it<00:02:19.609> in<00:02:19.760> and<00:02:20.000> that<00:02:20.510> means

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
and then wet sand it in and that means

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.569 
and then wet sand it in and that means
you<00:02:20.930> apply<00:02:21.049> oil<00:02:21.470> to<00:02:21.709> the<00:02:21.829> surface<00:02:22.010> and<00:02:22.370> then

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:22.579 
you apply oil to the surface and then

00:02:22.579 --> 00:02:24.940 
you apply oil to the surface and then
take<00:02:22.790> some<00:02:22.970> wet/dry<00:02:23.329> sandpaper<00:02:23.630> and<00:02:24.109> sand<00:02:24.170> it

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
take some wet/dry sandpaper and sand it

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:29.710 
take some wet/dry sandpaper and sand it
while<00:02:25.160> the<00:02:25.340> oil<00:02:25.370> is<00:02:25.760> wet<00:02:28.359> and<00:02:29.359> here's<00:02:29.570> what's

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
while the oil is wet and here's what's

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.110 
while the oil is wet and here's what's
happening<00:02:30.170> as<00:02:30.320> you<00:02:30.380> sand<00:02:31.160> the<00:02:31.670> wood<00:02:31.880> dust

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
happening as you sand the wood dust

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.000 
happening as you sand the wood dust
mixes<00:02:32.600> with<00:02:32.720> the<00:02:32.840> oil<00:02:32.989> and<00:02:33.320> creates<00:02:33.650> a<00:02:33.739> paste

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
mixes with the oil and creates a paste

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.580 
mixes with the oil and creates a paste
and<00:02:34.340> as<00:02:34.940> you<00:02:35.090> sand<00:02:35.359> that<00:02:35.690> paste<00:02:35.989> gets<00:02:36.260> packed

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
and as you sand that paste gets packed

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:39.520 
and as you sand that paste gets packed
into<00:02:36.859> the<00:02:37.040> pores<00:02:37.340> and<00:02:37.579> fills<00:02:38.209> the<00:02:38.420> grain<00:02:38.630> now

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
into the pores and fills the grain now

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:41.500 
into the pores and fills the grain now
it<00:02:39.650> doesn't<00:02:39.799> take<00:02:40.010> much<00:02:40.190> sanding<00:02:40.640> at<00:02:40.730> all<00:02:40.940> but

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
it doesn't take much sanding at all but

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:42.819 
it doesn't take much sanding at all but
once<00:02:41.660> you're<00:02:41.840> done<00:02:42.049> you<00:02:42.260> want<00:02:42.380> to<00:02:42.500> probably

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:42.829 
once you're done you want to probably

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:44.680 
once you're done you want to probably
apply<00:02:43.280> it<00:02:43.340> just<00:02:43.670> a<00:02:43.760> little<00:02:43.880> bit<00:02:44.030> of<00:02:44.180> oil<00:02:44.359> once

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
apply it just a little bit of oil once

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:47.080 
apply it just a little bit of oil once
again<00:02:44.959> to<00:02:45.109> the<00:02:45.200> top<00:02:45.400> wait<00:02:46.400> about<00:02:46.549> 10<00:02:46.850> minutes

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
again to the top wait about 10 minutes

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:48.970 
again to the top wait about 10 minutes
and<00:02:47.390> come<00:02:47.750> back<00:02:47.930> with<00:02:48.109> another<00:02:48.140> clean<00:02:48.650> rag<00:02:48.950> and

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
and come back with another clean rag and

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:54.160 
and come back with another clean rag and
wipe<00:02:49.760> it<00:02:50.090> off<00:02:50.269> going<00:02:50.720> across<00:02:51.079> the<00:02:51.260> grain

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.170 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:56.410 

and<00:02:54.410> after<00:02:55.010> you<00:02:55.100> wipe<00:02:55.250> it<00:02:55.400> off<00:02:55.520> you<00:02:55.940> let<00:02:56.060> it<00:02:56.210> dry

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420 
and after you wipe it off you let it dry

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.660 
and after you wipe it off you let it dry
overnight<00:02:56.720> and<00:02:57.110> you'll<00:02:57.980> see<00:02:58.190> that<00:02:58.310> the<00:02:58.459> grain

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
overnight and you'll see that the grain

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:00.610 
overnight and you'll see that the grain
has<00:02:58.850> started<00:02:59.209> to<00:02:59.300> get<00:02:59.420> nicely<00:02:59.870> filled<00:03:00.110> but<00:03:00.470> it

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
has started to get nicely filled but it

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:03.100 
has started to get nicely filled but it
probably<00:03:00.920> needs<00:03:01.100> a<00:03:01.160> little<00:03:01.310> bit<00:03:01.430> more<00:03:01.490> so<00:03:02.209> you

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:03.110 
probably needs a little bit more so you

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:04.449 
probably needs a little bit more so you
sand<00:03:03.410> it<00:03:03.500> a<00:03:03.560> little<00:03:03.709> bit<00:03:03.890> with<00:03:04.040> some<00:03:04.220> fine<00:03:04.430> grit

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:04.459 
sand it a little bit with some fine grit

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:14.690 
sand it a little bit with some fine grit
paper<00:03:04.850> and<00:03:05.590> redo<00:03:06.590> that<00:03:06.740> process

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.420 

and<00:03:15.209> after<00:03:15.480> about<00:03:15.569> 10<00:03:15.930> minutes<00:03:16.010> wipe<00:03:17.010> off<00:03:17.190> the

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
and after about 10 minutes wipe off the

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.520 
and after about 10 minutes wipe off the
excess<00:03:17.760> oil<00:03:18.000> going<00:03:18.300> across<00:03:18.569> the<00:03:18.840> drink<00:03:19.080> and

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
excess oil going across the drink and

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:23.210 
excess oil going across the drink and
then<00:03:20.340> let<00:03:20.489> it<00:03:20.520> dry<00:03:20.730> again<00:03:20.940> overnight<00:03:21.480> and<00:03:22.220> now

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
then let it dry again overnight and now

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.309 
then let it dry again overnight and now
that<00:03:23.430> board<00:03:23.760> is<00:03:24.030> perfectly<00:03:24.540> filled<00:03:24.840> and<00:03:25.050> ready

00:03:25.309 --> 00:03:25.319 
that board is perfectly filled and ready

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:27.800 
that board is perfectly filled and ready

a wood grain filler the application
process<00:03:54.690> is<00:03:55.110> just<00:03:55.440> slightly<00:03:55.739> different<00:03:55.890> but

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:56.640 
process is just slightly different but

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.100 
process is just slightly different but
the<00:03:56.730> end<00:03:56.970> result<00:03:57.269> is<00:03:57.390> virtually<00:03:57.900> the<00:03:57.930> same

across<00:04:31.379> the<00:04:31.560> green<00:04:35.029> and<00:04:36.029> then<00:04:36.180> you<00:04:36.300> may<00:04:36.419> want

00:04:36.559 --> 00:04:36.569 
across the green and then you may want

00:04:36.569 --> 00:04:38.450 
across the green and then you may want
to<00:04:36.689> use<00:04:36.810> a<00:04:36.840> cloth<00:04:37.139> or<00:04:37.379> a<00:04:37.439> rag<00:04:37.710> to<00:04:37.919> wipe<00:04:37.949> off<00:04:38.279> any

00:04:46.219 --> 00:04:46.229 
after this and after four hours it's

00:04:46.229 --> 00:04:48.019 
after this and after four hours it's
time<00:04:46.409> to<00:04:46.529> sand<00:04:46.770> this<00:04:46.860> down<00:04:46.919> a<00:04:47.099> little<00:04:47.279> bit<00:04:47.430> so

00:04:48.019 --> 00:04:48.029 
time to sand this down a little bit so

00:04:48.029 --> 00:04:49.730 
time to sand this down a little bit so
I'm<00:04:48.120> wiping<00:04:48.479> it<00:04:48.629> with<00:04:48.659> some<00:04:49.020> mineral<00:04:49.169> spirits

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:49.740 
I'm wiping it with some mineral spirits

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:52.640 
I'm wiping it with some mineral spirits
and<00:04:50.180> then<00:04:51.180> just<00:04:51.360> sanding<00:04:51.719> with<00:04:51.840> 220<00:04:52.349> grit

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:52.650 
and then just sanding with 220 grit

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:55.219 
and then just sanding with 220 grit
sandpaper<00:04:53.270> the<00:04:54.270> reason<00:04:54.599> for<00:04:54.719> the<00:04:54.870> sanding

00:04:55.219 --> 00:04:55.229 
sandpaper the reason for the sanding

00:04:55.229 --> 00:04:57.230 
sandpaper the reason for the sanding
here<00:04:55.439> is<00:04:55.560> because<00:04:56.039> a<00:04:56.069> little<00:04:56.340> bit<00:04:56.520> of<00:04:56.610> stain<00:04:56.939> in

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:57.240 
here is because a little bit of stain in

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:59.269 
here is because a little bit of stain in
the<00:04:57.300> wood<00:04:58.020> filler<00:04:58.229> actually<00:04:58.650> colors<00:04:58.949> the<00:04:59.099> wood

00:04:59.269 --> 00:04:59.279 
the wood filler actually colors the wood

00:04:59.279 --> 00:05:01.429 
the wood filler actually colors the wood
a<00:04:59.310> little<00:04:59.370> bit<00:04:59.669> so<00:05:00.029> I'm<00:05:00.389> sanding<00:05:00.960> it<00:05:01.080> here<00:05:01.289> just

00:05:01.429 --> 00:05:01.439 
a little bit so I'm sanding it here just

00:05:01.439 --> 00:05:03.019 
a little bit so I'm sanding it here just
to<00:05:01.529> pull<00:05:01.740> that<00:05:01.860> off<00:05:02.039> but<00:05:02.550> this<00:05:02.699> step<00:05:02.909> is

00:05:03.019 --> 00:05:03.029 
to pull that off but this step is

00:05:03.029 --> 00:05:05.089 
to pull that off but this step is
totally<00:05:03.330> optional<00:05:03.529> another<00:05:04.529> way<00:05:04.680> to<00:05:04.740> have

00:05:05.089 --> 00:05:05.099 
totally optional another way to have

00:05:05.099 --> 00:05:07.100 
totally optional another way to have
done<00:05:05.310> this<00:05:05.520> is<00:05:05.759> to<00:05:06.090> put<00:05:06.300> down<00:05:06.330> a<00:05:06.479> wash<00:05:06.810> coat

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:07.110 
done this is to put down a wash coat

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:08.779 
done this is to put down a wash coat
before<00:05:07.590> the<00:05:07.710> wood<00:05:07.860> filler<00:05:08.099> and<00:05:08.340> that<00:05:08.490> helps

00:05:08.779 --> 00:05:08.789 
before the wood filler and that helps

00:05:08.789 --> 00:05:11.019 
before the wood filler and that helps
keep<00:05:09.419> the<00:05:09.539> color<00:05:09.750> off<00:05:09.930> of<00:05:10.080> the<00:05:10.139> wood<00:05:10.319> as<00:05:10.469> well

00:05:11.019 --> 00:05:11.029 
keep the color off of the wood as well

00:05:11.029 --> 00:05:14.990 
keep the color off of the wood as well
and<00:05:13.159> here's<00:05:14.159> a<00:05:14.219> comparison

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:15.000 
and here's a comparison

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.670 
and here's a comparison
alright<00:05:15.419> this<00:05:15.569> board<00:05:15.870> on<00:05:15.960> the<00:05:16.050> left<00:05:16.080> has<00:05:16.650> no

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:16.680 
alright this board on the left has no

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:18.679 
alright this board on the left has no
filler<00:05:17.219> it's<00:05:17.460> just<00:05:17.639> been<00:05:17.759> sanded<00:05:18.150> the<00:05:18.479> board

00:05:18.679 --> 00:05:18.689 
filler it's just been sanded the board

00:05:18.689 --> 00:05:20.980 
filler it's just been sanded the board
on<00:05:18.779> the<00:05:18.900> right<00:05:19.080> is<00:05:19.289> the<00:05:20.009> one<00:05:20.039> we<00:05:20.279> just<00:05:20.490> filled

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:20.990 
on the right is the one we just filled

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:23.179 
on the right is the one we just filled
so<00:05:21.990> when<00:05:22.080> you<00:05:22.139> get<00:05:22.259> it<00:05:22.349> close<00:05:22.560> you<00:05:22.710> can<00:05:22.860> see<00:05:22.889> how

00:05:23.179 --> 00:05:23.189 
so when you get it close you can see how

00:05:23.189 --> 00:05:25.010 
so when you get it close you can see how
the<00:05:23.249> filler<00:05:23.550> has<00:05:23.789> colored<00:05:24.240> in<00:05:24.360> the<00:05:24.479> pores<00:05:24.749> real

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:25.020 
the filler has colored in the pores real

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:26.869 
the filler has colored in the pores real
nicely<00:05:25.409> and<00:05:25.560> add<00:05:25.889> a<00:05:25.919> little<00:05:26.249> bit<00:05:26.339> of<00:05:26.430> contrast

00:05:26.869 --> 00:05:26.879 
nicely and add a little bit of contrast

00:05:26.879 --> 00:05:31.730 
nicely and add a little bit of contrast
to<00:05:27.270> the<00:05:27.360> wood<00:05:29.689> next<00:05:30.689> step<00:05:30.990> is<00:05:31.169> to<00:05:31.289> add<00:05:31.469> a<00:05:31.500> couple

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:31.740 
to the wood next step is to add a couple

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:34.010 
to the wood next step is to add a couple
coats<00:05:32.189> of<00:05:32.370> sealer<00:05:32.580> in<00:05:32.879> this<00:05:33.539> case<00:05:33.750> that's

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:34.020 
coats of sealer in this case that's

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:35.990 
coats of sealer in this case that's
censor<00:05:34.469> seal<00:05:34.770> coat<00:05:35.009> which<00:05:35.219> is<00:05:35.250> AD<00:05:35.639> waxed

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:36.000 
censor seal coat which is AD waxed

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.269 
censor seal coat which is AD waxed
shellac<00:05:36.029> and<00:05:36.449> very<00:05:36.810> easy<00:05:36.990> to<00:05:37.169> use<00:05:37.349> you<00:05:37.620> let

00:05:38.269 --> 00:05:38.279 
shellac and very easy to use you let

00:05:38.279 --> 00:05:40.100 
shellac and very easy to use you let
that<00:05:38.430> dry<00:05:38.669> for<00:05:38.759> 10<00:05:39.180> or<00:05:39.210> 15<00:05:39.419> minutes<00:05:39.899> and<00:05:39.960> then

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:40.110 
that dry for 10 or 15 minutes and then

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:47.830 
that dry for 10 or 15 minutes and then
sand<00:05:40.469> it<00:05:40.560> down<00:05:40.620> a<00:05:40.770> little<00:05:40.949> bit

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:47.840 

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:50.000 

and<00:05:48.840> now<00:05:48.990> that<00:05:49.110> this<00:05:49.260> board<00:05:49.530> is<00:05:49.650> good<00:05:49.860> and

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:50.010 
and now that this board is good and

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:51.710 
and now that this board is good and
smooth<00:05:50.220> it's<00:05:50.490> time<00:05:50.700> to<00:05:50.850> put<00:05:51.000> on<00:05:51.120> the<00:05:51.240> final<00:05:51.420> top

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:51.720 
smooth it's time to put on the final top

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:53.690 
smooth it's time to put on the final top
coat<00:05:51.750> in<00:05:52.170> which<00:05:52.290> this<00:05:52.530> case<00:05:52.770> is<00:05:52.980> gelled

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:53.700 
coat in which this case is gelled

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:55.400 
coat in which this case is gelled
polyurethane<00:05:54.360> and<00:05:54.480> this<00:05:54.870> really<00:05:55.080> couldn't<00:05:55.290> be

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:55.410 
polyurethane and this really couldn't be

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:57.590 
polyurethane and this really couldn't be
any<00:05:55.530> easier<00:05:55.890> to<00:05:56.070> apply<00:05:56.310> you<00:05:56.940> just<00:05:57.150> wipe<00:05:57.330> it<00:05:57.450> on

00:05:57.590 --> 00:05:57.600 
any easier to apply you just wipe it on

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:59.660 
any easier to apply you just wipe it on
you<00:05:58.170> wipe<00:05:58.350> it<00:05:58.470> off<00:05:58.650> and<00:05:58.950> as<00:05:59.130> you<00:05:59.220> wipe<00:05:59.370> it<00:05:59.520> off

00:05:59.660 --> 00:05:59.670 
you wipe it off and as you wipe it off

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:06.629 
you wipe it off and as you wipe it off
you're<00:06:00.150> kind<00:06:00.360> of<00:06:00.450> buffing<00:06:00.840> it's<00:06:00.990> smooth

00:06:06.629 --> 00:06:06.639 

00:06:06.639 --> 00:06:09.149 

and<00:06:07.169> then<00:06:08.169> it<00:06:08.319> needs<00:06:08.500> to<00:06:08.560> dry<00:06:08.800> for<00:06:08.860> at<00:06:09.099> least

00:06:09.149 --> 00:06:09.159 
and then it needs to dry for at least

00:06:09.159 --> 00:06:11.010 
and then it needs to dry for at least
six<00:06:09.460> hours<00:06:09.580> and<00:06:09.969> then<00:06:10.240> you<00:06:10.360> can<00:06:10.539> recode<00:06:10.900> it

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:11.020 
six hours and then you can recode it

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:13.170 
six hours and then you can recode it
again<00:06:11.259> and<00:06:11.469> what<00:06:12.340> you'll<00:06:12.520> end<00:06:12.669> up<00:06:12.729> with<00:06:12.909> is<00:06:13.120> a

00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:13.180 
again and what you'll end up with is a

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:24.779 
again and what you'll end up with is a
very<00:06:13.659> nice<00:06:13.960> smooth<00:06:14.680> clean<00:06:15.370> finish<00:06:23.759> so<00:06:24.759> you

00:06:24.779 --> 00:06:24.789 
very nice smooth clean finish so you

00:06:24.789 --> 00:06:26.309 
very nice smooth clean finish so you
might<00:06:25.030> be<00:06:25.180> wondering<00:06:25.360> which<00:06:25.659> frame<00:06:25.960> filling

00:06:26.309 --> 00:06:26.319 
might be wondering which frame filling

00:06:26.319 --> 00:06:28.499 
might be wondering which frame filling
method<00:06:26.620> works<00:06:26.860> the<00:06:27.099> best<00:06:27.310> well<00:06:28.180> they<00:06:28.330> really

00:06:28.499 --> 00:06:28.509 
method works the best well they really

00:06:28.509 --> 00:06:30.420 
method works the best well they really
come<00:06:28.780> out<00:06:28.870> about<00:06:29.169> the<00:06:29.349> same<00:06:29.620> the<00:06:30.039> only<00:06:30.310> the

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:30.430 
come out about the same the only the

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:31.709 
come out about the same the only the
process<00:06:30.969> is<00:06:31.150> different

00:06:31.709 --> 00:06:31.719 
process is different

00:06:31.719 --> 00:06:34.320 
process is different
so<00:06:31.900> effectively<00:06:32.860> choose<00:06:33.789> whichever<00:06:34.090> method

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:34.330 
so effectively choose whichever method

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:37.020 
so effectively choose whichever method
appeals<00:06:35.050> to<00:06:35.289> you<00:06:35.379> more<00:06:35.680> so<00:06:36.219> with<00:06:36.400> that<00:06:36.580> I<00:06:36.789> hope
