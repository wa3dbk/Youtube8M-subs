I<00:01:41.009> was<00:01:41.460> expecting<00:01:41.880> you<00:01:41.970> know<00:01:42.030> because

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299

I was expecting you know because
intimidate<00:01:42.990> he's<00:01:43.170> probably<00:01:43.409> not<00:01:43.860> gonna<00:01:44.100> see

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.340 
intimidate he's probably not gonna see
the<00:01:44.490> switch<00:01:44.759> happening<00:01:44.899> but<00:01:45.899> that's<00:01:46.140> why<00:01:46.320> I

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
the switch happening but that's why I

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.440 
the switch happening but that's why I
did<00:01:46.619> it<00:01:46.649> and<00:01:46.770> he<00:01:47.070> did<00:01:47.100> go<00:01:47.369> for<00:01:47.520> overheat<00:01:47.939> with<00:01:48.420> a

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
did it and he did go for overheat with a

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.330 
did it and he did go for overheat with a
big<00:01:48.689> fat<00:01:48.869> I<00:01:48.899> took<00:01:49.170> that<00:01:49.290> extremely<00:01:49.890> well<00:01:50.100> but

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
big fat I took that extremely well but

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:51.980 
big fat I took that extremely well but
then<00:01:50.549> he<00:01:50.790> scores<00:01:51.149> a<00:01:51.270> crit

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
then he scores a crit

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.050 
then he scores a crit
which<00:01:52.439> also<00:01:52.710> means<00:01:53.009> that<00:01:53.250> he's<00:01:53.430> not<00:01:53.579> at

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
which also means that he's not at

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.240 
which also means that he's not at
minus-2<00:01:54.570> he<00:01:54.810> was<00:01:54.960> neutral<00:01:55.350> and<00:01:55.560> the<00:01:56.040> Creed

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
minus-2 he was neutral and the Creed

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.880 
minus-2 he was neutral and the Creed
also<00:01:56.579> goes<00:01:56.729> past<00:01:57.030> that<00:01:57.180> so<00:01:57.960> that's<00:01:58.229> horrible

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
also goes past that so that's horrible

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.920 
also goes past that so that's horrible
now<00:01:59.130> I<00:01:59.399> do<00:01:59.610> manage<00:01:59.939> to<00:02:00.119> make<00:02:00.270> the<00:02:00.450> right<00:02:00.659> play

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
now I do manage to make the right play

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.749 
now I do manage to make the right play
the<00:02:00.960> right<00:02:01.560> decision<00:02:01.979> at<00:02:02.070> the<00:02:02.100> right<00:02:02.189> time<00:02:02.549> as

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
the right decision at the right time as

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.680 
the right decision at the right time as

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970 
means he probably runs him power ground

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:27.210 
means he probably runs him power ground
I<00:03:25.270> mean<00:03:25.300> honestly<00:03:26.290> looking<00:03:26.590> at<00:03:26.680> his<00:03:26.830> team<00:03:27.010> he's

got a Heatran and that kind of got me at

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:31.500 
got a Heatran and that kind of got me at
the<00:03:29.709> idea<00:03:29.980> of<00:03:30.070> he's<00:03:30.610> probably<00:03:30.820> scared<00:03:31.180> of<00:03:31.330> heat

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:31.510 
the idea of he's probably scared of heat

the idea of he's probably scared of heat
rents<00:03:31.780> as<00:03:31.900> well<00:03:32.170> so<00:03:33.010> yeah<00:03:33.700> hidden<00:03:34.120> power

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:34.300 
rents as well so yeah hidden power

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:36.090 
rents as well so yeah hidden power
ground<00:03:34.570> means<00:03:34.989> that<00:03:35.260> it<00:03:35.470> can<00:03:35.650> handle<00:03:35.800> heat

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:36.100

probably world is pretty much on the HP
is<00:03:59.260> that<00:03:59.410> it's<00:03:59.739> kind<00:03:59.950> of<00:04:00.010> a<00:04:00.070> bit<00:04:00.489> silly<00:04:00.850> to

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:00.970 
is that it's kind of a bit silly to

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:16.390 
Aquajet I guess I should probably do

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:17.229 
Aquajet I guess I should probably do
something<00:04:16.690> else<00:04:16.840> I

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:17.239 
something else I

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:18.550 
something else I
should<00:04:17.479> probably<00:04:17.660> even<00:04:18.019> make<00:04:18.139> a<00:04:18.199> double

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:18.560 
should probably even make a double

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:21.249 
should probably even make a double
switch<00:04:18.739> expect<00:04:19.190> him<00:04:19.340> to<00:04:19.370> switch<00:04:19.699> out<00:04:19.910> but<00:04:20.259> you

00:04:21.249 --> 00:04:21.259

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:41.720

more<00:04:43.789> damage<00:04:44.120> to<00:04:44.449> him<00:04:44.630> and<00:04:44.840> my<00:04:45.259> main<00:04:45.440> plan<00:04:45.680> was

00:04:45.879 --> 00:04:45.889 
more damage to him and my main plan was
