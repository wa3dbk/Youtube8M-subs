00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:10.919
 Automatically translated by the machine. I got a lot of questions about my hair. 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:34.550
 How do I achieve a fade in copper from the pink pink tip. 

00:00:40.769 --> 00:00:43.579
 I am not an expert, but I use it, this is the routine. 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:48.989
 I always recommend going to a barber shop just in case. 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:55.989
 You can see the picture at the top of the photo, if it is pink, it has faded out and bottom 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.390
 It is freshly dyed. This is the end result. 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:15.119
 I generally start before my root bleach. I use pink is not permanent, but copper 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:22.119
 At the top, so it doesn't need to touch the UPS. 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:29.340
 Usually, I save time when doing all this bathing. 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:33.409
 First shampoo your hair. Excess excess moisture, but 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:35.259
 Keep it fair and wet. This whole process is really the best thing to do 

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:35.549
 Shower so you don't get dyes and water everywhere! 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:42.549
 Divided into two parts, the way the needle is edged. 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:55.310
 Give it a good pass brush. This whole process will depend on the dye 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.280
 You use. Please read it carefully and follow the personal instructions. 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:05.280
 There. Twist each section inward to your face. 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:12.380
 This technique is exactly my dye and my hair type, it may not work properly. 

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:27.400
 your. The dye I use here is called "Wakk staining" 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.790
 In pink. Squeeze the amount to your palm 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:28.610
 hand. Depending on the dye, it may be necessary 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:35.610
 wear gloves. Put a little bit of dye at your fingertips 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:47.959
 Rub the bottom of the gradient where you want to start. 

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:06.239
 Rub the hair around the twisted knot of the finger. 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:09.610
 Continue to add a little twist to the color of the arund finger. 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:16.610
 Add more towards the bottom to make the color brighter. 

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:19.939
 To make a nice gradual upward top just move a small amount of dye with your finger 

00:03:19.939 --> 00:03:26.939
 Already your hair is up. Because the hair is wet, you should be able to 

00:03:32.439 --> 00:03:39.439
 Moving dyes is quite easy. Continue to distort and add dye. 

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:47.819
 Twist to prevent the dye from covering every strand of hair, so when it's flawless 

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:58.519
 Dry and fade more slowly. Every now, then you can untie the hair 

00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:05.060
 By using your fingers and comb. This will let you see how the color is going 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:10.439
 And there you need to add more. After a while, you can start to see the fading 

00:04:10.439 --> 00:04:15.579
 form. Once you have a top faded way 

00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:22.579
 Hope it just adds a bunch of more dye to the bottom part, so it's bright and beautiful. 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:39.200
 Time to go to the shower and wash it all! 

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:46.200
 I don't need to stay in the dyes I use for a long time, so I usually just wash it out and then add 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:49.020
 As long as I am doing the conditions. It doesn't stain, so you can see it coming out 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:49.340
 Straighten my hand. what! I even managed to make up all my make up 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:49.590
 Itâ€™s time to wash. This is an achievement! Blow dry and you are all done. 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:51.450
 You may want to take advantage of this time and have your own slow motion business moment... 

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:57.250
 Or not. Ruined! It is brighter and fades 

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:59.960
 It is very slow. As I said, this is just a technology. 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:02.300
 For my work, it may not suit you depending on the type of hair and the dye you are using. 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:02.900
 Pretty pink hair and fading are pretty good, yeah! 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:03.760
 This dye decays very fast, so I usually do it once a week or just when I am lazy 

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:04.700
 I have a special event. I hope this is a useful video, please check 

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:05.150

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:05.400
