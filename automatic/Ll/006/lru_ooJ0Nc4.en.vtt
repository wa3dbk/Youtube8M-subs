00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:13.010 
you kind of just want to start out and

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:16.600 
you kind of just want to start out and
see<00:04:13.910> how<00:04:14.210> this<00:04:14.480> miss<00:04:14.990> set<00:04:15.350> works<00:04:15.680> and<00:04:16.070> if<00:04:16.489> you

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:16.610

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:18.230 
want to go to more higher end because

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:20.380 
want to go to more higher end because
that's<00:04:18.440> just<00:04:18.799> the<00:04:19.100> way<00:04:19.250> you<00:04:19.310> are<00:04:19.580> or<00:04:19.940> you<00:04:20.120> just

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:20.390 
that's just the way you are or you just

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:22.180 
that's just the way you are or you just
think<00:04:20.630> that<00:04:20.660> it<00:04:20.840> would<00:04:20.930> be<00:04:21.019> better<00:04:21.230> try<00:04:21.920> it<00:04:21.980> out

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:22.190 
think that it would be better try it out

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:24.100 
think that it would be better try it out
but<00:04:22.430> every<00:04:22.880> a<00:04:22.910> lot<00:04:23.210> of<00:04:23.330> people<00:04:23.690> are<00:04:23.840> saying

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:24.110 
but every a lot of people are saying

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:26.230 
but every a lot of people are saying
that<00:04:24.350> this<00:04:24.770> is<00:04:24.830> very<00:04:25.280> comparable<00:04:25.760> to<00:04:25.970> the

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:26.240 
that this is very comparable to the

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:28.230 
that this is very comparable to the
higher<00:04:26.450> end<00:04:26.780> like<00:04:26.960> model<00:04:27.350> in<00:04:27.470> a<00:04:27.530> bottle<00:04:27.920> and
