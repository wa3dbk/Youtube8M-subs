now there is a now he's starting to I

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:04.720 
now there is a now he's starting to I
think<00:01:01.430> he<00:01:01.760> was<00:01:01.940> out<00:01:02.180> how<00:01:03.050> he<00:01:03.110> is<00:01:04.040> he<00:01:04.220> just<00:01:04.430> this

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:04.730 
think he was out how he is he just this

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:06.370 
think he was out how he is he just this
the<00:01:04.910> way<00:01:05.030> he<00:01:05.150> was<00:01:05.300> lying<00:01:05.570> there<00:01:05.900> this<00:01:06.110> looked

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:06.380 
the way he was lying there this looked

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.070 
the way he was lying there this looked
like<00:01:06.470> as<00:01:06.950> I<00:01:07.070> said<00:01:07.280> a<00:01:07.310> Nystrom<00:01:08.150> shoulder<00:01:08.630> or<00:01:08.870> his

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:09.080 
like as I said a Nystrom shoulder or his

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:11.740 
like as I said a Nystrom shoulder or his
elbow<00:01:09.320> cut<00:01:09.910> Garbowsky<00:01:10.940> just<00:01:11.240> as<00:01:11.360> he<00:01:11.479> turned

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:11.750 
elbow cut Garbowsky just as he turned

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:13.690 
elbow cut Garbowsky just as he turned
around<00:01:11.900> what<00:01:12.440> from<00:01:12.650> the<00:01:12.740> angle<00:01:13.130> we're<00:01:13.280> sitting

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:13.700 
around what from the angle we're sitting

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.610 
around what from the angle we're sitting
at<00:01:13.820> and<00:01:14.150> it's<00:01:14.300> really<00:01:14.570> the<00:01:14.720> same<00:01:14.930> angle<00:01:15.290> we<00:01:15.410> saw

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:15.620 
at and it's really the same angle we saw

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:16.300 
at and it's really the same angle we saw
on<00:01:15.740> the<00:01:15.860> replay

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:16.310 
on the replay

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:18.160 
on the replay
I<00:01:16.460> thought<00:01:16.940> he<00:01:17.090> led<00:01:17.360> with<00:01:17.570> the<00:01:17.660> shoulder

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:18.170 
I thought he led with the shoulder

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:19.810 
I thought he led with the shoulder
rather<00:01:18.350> than<00:01:18.650> the<00:01:18.770> elbow<00:01:19.160> will<00:01:19.310> may<00:01:19.520> get<00:01:19.790> a

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:19.820 
rather than the elbow will may get a

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:22.510 
rather than the elbow will may get a
better<00:01:20.270> idea<00:01:20.390> if<00:01:21.170> we<00:01:21.410> if<00:01:21.650> we<00:01:21.680> see<00:01:22.010> a<00:01:22.040> different

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:22.520 
better idea if we if we see a different

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.999 
better idea if we if we see a different
angle<00:01:22.640> the<00:01:23.330> the<00:01:23.570> question<00:01:24.080> when<00:01:24.410> penalties

00:01:24.999 --> 00:01:25.009 
angle the the question when penalties

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:27.160 
angle the the question when penalties
come<00:01:25.280> into<00:01:25.550> play<00:01:25.759> here<00:01:26.090> is<00:01:26.270> was<00:01:26.780> the<00:01:26.960> head

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:27.170 
come into play here is was the head

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.290 
come into play here is was the head
targeted<00:01:27.800> and<00:01:27.950> I<00:01:28.009> didn't<00:01:28.340> think<00:01:28.550> he<00:01:28.700> targeted

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:29.300 
targeted and I didn't think he targeted

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:31.180 
targeted and I didn't think he targeted
the<00:01:29.420> head<00:01:29.600> but<00:01:29.840> again<00:01:30.500> maybe<00:01:30.710> a<00:01:30.830> different

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:31.190 
the head but again maybe a different

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:32.109 
the head but again maybe a different
look<00:01:31.310> would<00:01:31.490> give<00:01:31.610> us<00:01:31.700> a<00:01:31.880> different

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:32.119 
look would give us a different

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:37.930 
look would give us a different
perspective<00:01:32.390> off<00:01:33.080> ski<00:01:33.320> and<00:01:33.440> this<00:01:33.560> is<00:01:33.710> why<00:01:36.940> you

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:37.940 
perspective off ski and this is why you

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:39.820 
perspective off ski and this is why you
can<00:01:38.090> see<00:01:38.300> that<00:01:38.509> he's<00:01:38.990> out<00:01:39.200> on<00:01:39.229> the<00:01:39.380> way<00:01:39.590> back

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:39.830 
can see that he's out on the way back

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:42.609 
can see that he's out on the way back
down<00:01:40.190> and<00:01:40.850> it's<00:01:41.000> just<00:01:41.630> really<00:01:41.899> hard<00:01:42.110> to<00:01:42.350> tell

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:42.619 
down and it's just really hard to tell

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:44.380 
down and it's just really hard to tell
whether<00:01:42.860> he<00:01:43.009> gets<00:01:43.130> him<00:01:43.340> with<00:01:43.490> the<00:01:43.610> shoulder<00:01:44.000> or

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:44.390 
whether he gets him with the shoulder or

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:45.850 
whether he gets him with the shoulder or
the<00:01:44.570> elbow<00:01:44.930> I<00:01:45.110> think<00:01:45.350> he<00:01:45.470> led<00:01:45.680> with<00:01:45.830> the

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:45.860 
the elbow I think he led with the

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:48.190 
the elbow I think he led with the
shoulder<00:01:46.310> yeah<00:01:46.520> he<00:01:46.670> did<00:01:46.880> I<00:01:47.119> I<00:01:47.450> would<00:01:48.020> agree

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:48.200 
shoulder yeah he did I I would agree

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.480 
shoulder yeah he did I I would agree
with<00:01:48.290> you<00:01:48.530> that's<00:01:48.830> that's<00:01:49.009> what<00:01:49.250> it<00:01:49.340> looked

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:49.490 
with you that's that's what it looked

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:50.920 
with you that's that's what it looked
like<00:01:49.670> now<00:01:49.850> the<00:01:49.910> coaching<00:01:50.330> staff<00:01:50.570> may<00:01:50.750> have<00:01:50.780> a

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:50.930 
like now the coaching staff may have a

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:52.210 
like now the coaching staff may have a
different<00:01:51.350> a<00:01:51.470> different<00:01:51.500> look<00:01:51.950> and<00:01:52.160> now

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:52.220
