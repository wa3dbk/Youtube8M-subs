filling up as you can see I just filled
up<00:00:28.380> some<00:00:28.619> more<00:00:28.830> because<00:00:29.070> I<00:00:29.250> escaped<00:00:30.119> from<00:00:30.420> a

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
up some more because I escaped from a

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.150 
up some more because I escaped from a
pursuit<00:00:30.960> now<00:00:31.410> when<00:00:31.710> you<00:00:31.800> escape<00:00:32.130> from

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
pursuit now when you escape from

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.470 
pursuit now when you escape from
pursuits<00:00:32.730> you<00:00:32.940> get<00:00:33.120> a<00:00:33.149> ton<00:00:33.630> of<00:00:34.700> points<00:00:35.700> that<00:00:36.120> go

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
pursuits you get a ton of points that go

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.420 
pursuits you get a ton of points that go
towards<00:00:36.930> your<00:00:37.079> multiplier<00:00:37.559> it<00:00:37.980> also<00:00:38.160> goes

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
towards your multiplier it also goes

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.250 
towards your multiplier it also goes
towards<00:00:38.850> your<00:00:38.940> heat<00:00:39.120> level<00:00:39.420> as<00:00:39.510> well<00:00:39.750> so<00:00:40.170> you

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
towards your heat level as well so you

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.990 
towards your heat level as well so you
want<00:00:40.440> to<00:00:40.500> be<00:00:40.559> kind<00:00:40.890> of<00:00:40.920> careful<00:00:41.100> about<00:00:41.640> trying

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
want to be kind of careful about trying

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.180 
want to be kind of careful about trying
to<00:00:42.030> get<00:00:42.210> so<00:00:42.809> many<00:00:42.930> points<00:00:43.170> and<00:00:43.530> heat<00:00:43.890> levels

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
to get so many points and heat levels

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.770 
to get so many points and heat levels
because<00:00:44.430> when<00:00:44.610> you<00:00:44.670> get<00:00:44.820> entire<00:00:45.180> heat<00:00:45.450> levels

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
because when you get entire heat levels

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.630 
because when you get entire heat levels
it<00:00:46.170> becomes<00:00:46.320> harder<00:00:47.010> to<00:00:47.039> escape<00:00:47.340> from

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
it becomes harder to escape from

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.840 
it becomes harder to escape from
pursuits<00:00:48.270> as<00:00:49.020> you<00:00:49.170> can<00:00:49.289> see<00:00:49.500> here<00:00:49.770> I<00:00:50.070> am<00:00:50.430> in<00:00:50.760> a

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
pursuits as you can see here I am in a

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.910 
pursuits as you can see here I am in a
shoot<00:00:51.180> but<00:00:51.719> it's<00:00:51.840> also<00:00:52.020> the<00:00:52.260> easiest<00:00:52.620> way<00:00:52.890> to

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
shoot but it's also the easiest way to

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.610 
shoot but it's also the easiest way to
get<00:00:53.480> multiplier<00:00:54.480> points<00:00:54.899> and<00:00:55.170> as<00:00:55.350> you<00:00:55.469> can<00:00:55.559> see

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
get multiplier points and as you can see

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.610 
get multiplier points and as you can see
as<00:00:56.070> you<00:00:56.129> go<00:00:56.309> and<00:00:56.730> do<00:00:56.940> things<00:00:57.180> like<00:00:57.390> do<00:00:58.140> perfect

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
as you go and do things like do perfect

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.090 
as you go and do things like do perfect

we'll all go students high speeds your
multiplier<00:01:10.140> will<00:01:10.350> slowly<00:01:10.560> fill<00:01:10.830> up<00:01:11.070> if<00:01:11.250> you

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
multiplier will slowly fill up if you

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.429 
multiplier will slowly fill up if you
keep<00:01:11.490> continue<00:01:12.060> looking<00:01:12.330> at<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:12.810> multiplier

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
keep continue looking at the multiplier

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.440 
keep continue looking at the multiplier
you<00:01:13.470> can<00:01:13.680> see<00:01:13.890> certain<00:01:14.670> things<00:01:14.700> that<00:01:15.150> you<00:01:15.240> get

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
you can see certain things that you get

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.590 
you can see certain things that you get
you<00:01:15.630> new<00:01:16.320> more<00:01:17.220> points<00:01:17.640> and<00:01:17.880> you<00:01:18.210> will<00:01:18.330> slowly

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
you new more points and you will slowly

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.840 
you new more points and you will slowly
increase<00:01:18.960> them<00:01:19.590> up<00:01:19.740> and<00:01:19.950> you<00:01:20.220> can<00:01:20.340> see<00:01:20.520> this<00:01:20.670> is

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
increase them up and you can see this is

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.270 
increase them up and you can see this is
a<00:01:20.880> very<00:01:21.240> early<00:01:21.960> in<00:01:22.110> the<00:01:22.229> game<00:01:22.259> that<00:01:22.799> I<00:01:22.830> got<00:01:23.130> this

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
a very early in the game that I got this

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.580 
a very early in the game that I got this
because<00:01:23.729> I<00:01:24.240> found<00:01:24.479> it<00:01:24.600> very<00:01:24.630> hard<00:01:24.840> to<00:01:25.110> escape

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
because I found it very hard to escape

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.830 
because I found it very hard to escape
from<00:01:25.740> the<00:01:25.920> police<00:01:26.070> with<00:01:26.820> such<00:01:27.119> that<00:01:27.450> kind<00:01:27.630> of<00:01:27.720> a

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
from the police with such that kind of a

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.020 
from the police with such that kind of a
slow<00:01:28.170> car<00:01:28.439> and<00:01:28.860> the<00:01:29.130> police<00:01:29.520> just<00:01:29.549> seem<00:01:29.939> to

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
slow car and the police just seem to

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.210 
slow car and the police just seem to
always<00:01:30.210> be<00:01:30.360> able<00:01:30.540> to<00:01:30.630> catch<00:01:30.840> up<00:01:31.049> to<00:01:31.079> me<00:01:31.259> so<00:01:31.829> it

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
always be able to catch up to me so it

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.270 
always be able to catch up to me so it
was<00:01:32.340> very<00:01:32.579> hard<00:01:32.790> for<00:01:32.909> me<00:01:33.090> to<00:01:33.150> escape<00:01:34.280> earlier

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
was very hard for me to escape earlier

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.010 
was very hard for me to escape earlier
in<00:01:35.520> the<00:01:35.670> game<00:01:35.790> and<00:01:36.030> also<00:01:36.360> because<00:01:36.659> I<00:01:36.780> was<00:01:36.869> new

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
in the game and also because I was new

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.020 
in the game and also because I was new
to<00:01:37.049> the<00:01:37.229> game<00:01:37.350> I<00:01:37.710> didn't<00:01:38.070> know<00:01:38.189> all<00:01:38.430> the<00:01:38.579> tricks

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
to the game I didn't know all the tricks

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.569 
to the game I didn't know all the tricks
and<00:01:39.299> kind<00:01:39.659> of<00:01:39.720> thing<00:01:39.960> that<00:01:40.140> you<00:01:40.470> can<00:01:40.590> do<00:01:40.799> and<00:01:41.070> so

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
and kind of thing that you can do and so

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.819 
and kind of thing that you can do and so
what<00:01:41.850> you<00:01:41.970> want<00:01:42.090> to<00:01:42.180> see<00:01:42.329> as<00:01:42.780> you<00:01:42.930> can<00:01:43.079> see<00:01:43.229> just

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
what you want to see as you can see just

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.319 
what you want to see as you can see just
drifting<00:01:44.460> it<00:01:44.610> gives<00:01:44.820> you<00:01:44.909> a<00:01:44.939> whole<00:01:45.119> lot<00:01:45.270> of

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
drifting it gives you a whole lot of

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.090 
drifting it gives you a whole lot of
points<00:01:45.570> you<00:01:45.720> get<00:01:46.020> some<00:01:46.200> good<00:01:46.439> drifts<00:01:46.770> in<00:01:46.890> and

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
points you get some good drifts in and

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.940 
points you get some good drifts in and
stuff<00:01:47.610> now<00:01:48.030> what<00:01:48.299> you<00:01:48.390> can<00:01:48.540> see<00:01:48.750> here<00:01:48.780> is<00:01:49.290> I'm

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
stuff now what you can see here is I'm

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.940 
stuff now what you can see here is I'm
at<00:01:50.070> heat<00:01:50.280> level<00:01:50.549> 9<00:01:50.729> or<00:01:51.060> heat<00:01:51.689> level<00:01:51.960> 9<00:01:52.140> and<00:01:52.560> I<00:01:52.829> am

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
at heat level 9 or heat level 9 and I am

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.999 
at heat level 9 or heat level 9 and I am
at<00:01:53.600> what's<00:01:54.600> it<00:01:54.750> called<00:01:54.960> multiplier<00:01:55.590> level<00:01:55.890> 9

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
at what's it called multiplier level 9

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:59.690 
at what's it called multiplier level 9
and<00:01:56.250> I<00:01:56.280> just<00:01:56.520> did<00:01:56.729> a<00:01:56.969> perfect<00:01:57.420> boost<00:01:58.079> and<00:01:58.700> well

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
and I just did a perfect boost and well

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.459 
and I just did a perfect boost and well
I<00:01:59.729> did<00:02:00.090> and<00:02:00.329> then<00:02:00.450> a<00:02:00.479> crashed<00:02:00.810> right<00:02:01.049> after<00:02:01.380> it

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
I did and then a crashed right after it

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.440 
I did and then a crashed right after it
so<00:02:01.560> I<00:02:01.619> did<00:02:01.829> get<00:02:01.979> those<00:02:02.130> points<00:02:02.369> and<00:02:02.670> I<00:02:03.000> also<00:02:03.210> got

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
so I did get those points and I also got

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.749 
so I did get those points and I also got
the<00:02:03.600> points<00:02:03.930> from<00:02:04.110> escaping<00:02:04.740> from<00:02:05.009> a<00:02:05.219> shoot

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
the points from escaping from a shoot

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.580 
the points from escaping from a shoot
now<00:02:06.270> as<00:02:06.390> you<00:02:06.479> can<00:02:06.570> see<00:02:06.719> I'm<00:02:06.869> now<00:02:07.049> at<00:02:07.229> hit<00:02:07.409> level

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
now as you can see I'm now at hit level

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.770 
now as you can see I'm now at hit level
10<00:02:07.740> and<00:02:08.129> I<00:02:08.190> have<00:02:08.399> got<00:02:08.610> a<00:02:08.759> multiplier<00:02:09.330> level<00:02:09.599> 10

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
10 and I have got a multiplier level 10

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.270 
10 and I have got a multiplier level 10
and<00:02:09.959> that's<00:02:10.349> how<00:02:10.500> you<00:02:10.560> get<00:02:10.739> it<00:02:10.860> so<00:02:10.950> I<00:02:10.979> got<00:02:11.160> the

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
level 10 and then I also got the

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.550 
level 10 and then I also got the
multiplier<00:02:16.580> tired<00:02:17.580> like<00:02:18.110> multiply<00:02:19.110> at<00:02:19.260> times

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
multiplier tired like multiply at times

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.230 
multiplier tired like multiply at times
10<00:02:19.830> and<00:02:20.040> that's<00:02:20.520> how<00:02:20.670> you<00:02:20.730> get<00:02:20.880> this<00:02:21.060> trophy

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
10 and that's how you get this trophy

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:24.170 
10 and that's how you get this trophy
it's<00:02:22.040> sort<00:02:23.040> of<00:02:23.100> easy<00:02:23.250> sort<00:02:23.580> of<00:02:23.670> hard<00:02:23.850> and<00:02:24.030> as

trophy<00:02:48.330> easier<00:02:48.840> so<00:02:49.170> it's<00:02:49.709> not<00:02:49.860> too<00:02:50.130> hard<00:02:50.430> but

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
trophy easier so it's not too hard but

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:52.790 
trophy easier so it's not too hard but
if<00:02:51.239> you're<00:02:51.420> not<00:02:51.540> the<00:02:51.810> greatest<00:02:52.200> racing<00:02:52.560> car

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 
if you're not the greatest racing car

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.970 
if you're not the greatest racing car
driver<00:02:53.420> you<00:02:54.420> may<00:02:54.750> find<00:02:55.050> it<00:02:55.200> hard<00:02:55.380> to<00:02:55.440> get<00:02:55.890> the

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
driver you may find it hard to get the

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.550 
driver you may find it hard to get the
multiplier<00:02:56.430> without<00:02:56.790> getting<00:02:57.060> busted<00:02:57.560> you

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
multiplier without getting busted you

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.160 
multiplier without getting busted you
don't<00:02:58.800> have<00:02:58.980> to<00:02:59.069> escape<00:02:59.280> to<00:02:59.640> get<00:02:59.790> there

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.170 
don't have to escape to get there

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:02.750 
don't have to escape to get there
multiplied<00:03:01.170> you<00:03:01.230> just<00:03:01.590> have<00:03:01.769> to<00:03:01.890> reach<00:03:02.160> this

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
multiplied you just have to reach this

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.670 
multiplied you just have to reach this
multiplier<00:03:03.269> so<00:03:03.510> if<00:03:03.720> you<00:03:03.810> even<00:03:04.170> if<00:03:04.319> you<00:03:04.440> reach

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
multiplier so if you even if you reach

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.259 
multiplier so if you even if you reach
it<00:03:04.890> and<00:03:04.980> you're<00:03:05.069> stalling<00:03:05.310> up<00:03:05.430> pursuit<00:03:05.819> then

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:06.269 
it and you're stalling up pursuit then

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:08.000 
it and you're stalling up pursuit then
that's<00:03:06.480> fine<00:03:06.720> you<00:03:06.930> should<00:03:06.959> get<00:03:07.410> the<00:03:07.530> trophy<00:03:07.860> as

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
that's fine you should get the trophy as

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:09.979 
that's fine you should get the trophy as
