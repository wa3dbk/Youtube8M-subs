00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
same size but when i go back to that

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.340

text<00:00:50.520> message<00:00:50.850> that<00:00:50.879> was<00:00:51.210> in<00:00:51.329> earlier<00:00:51.660> you<00:00:52.110> see

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
text message that was in earlier you see

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.920 
text message that was in earlier you see
it's<00:00:52.620> been<00:00:53.160> you<00:00:53.460> know<00:00:53.489> drastically<00:00:54.180> enlarged

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
it's been you know drastically enlarged

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.619 
it's been you know drastically enlarged
so<00:00:55.260> it<00:00:55.649> works<00:00:56.070> like<00:00:56.219> this<00:00:56.430> on<00:00:56.640> android<00:00:57.000> 2.3<00:00:57.600> and

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
so it works like this on android 2.3 and

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.869 
so it works like this on android 2.3 and
before<00:00:57.989> but<00:00:58.590> if<00:00:58.829> you<00:00:58.920> have<00:00:59.160> a<00:00:59.190> device<00:00:59.460> that<00:00:59.730> has

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
before but if you have a device that has

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.330 
before but if you have a device that has
Android<00:01:00.390> Ice<00:01:00.600> Cream<00:01:00.629> Sandwich<00:01:00.840> like<00:01:01.680> this<00:01:02.129> guy

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
Android Ice Cream Sandwich like this guy

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.039 
Android Ice Cream Sandwich like this guy
over<00:01:02.489> here<00:01:02.609> you<00:01:03.270> could<00:01:03.420> actually<00:01:03.449> do<00:01:03.750> the<00:01:03.870> same

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
over here you could actually do the same

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:05.240 
over here you could actually do the same
thing<00:01:04.290> so<00:01:04.589> I'm<00:01:04.650> just<00:01:04.739> going<00:01:04.860> to<00:01:04.920> go<00:01:05.010> ahead<00:01:05.070> and

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
thing so I'm just going to go ahead and

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.310 
thing so I'm just going to go ahead and
go<00:01:05.369> to<00:01:05.400> settings<00:01:05.880> I'm<00:01:06.630> gonna<00:01:06.869> go<00:01:06.960> down<00:01:07.110> to

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
go to settings I'm gonna go down to

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.700 
go to settings I'm gonna go down to
accessibility<00:01:07.619> and<00:01:08.330> then<00:01:09.350> I'm<00:01:10.350> just<00:01:10.470> going<00:01:10.619> to

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
accessibility and then I'm just going to

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.280 
accessibility and then I'm just going to
check<00:01:10.950> the<00:01:11.189> large<00:01:11.460> text<00:01:11.880> box<00:01:11.909> right<00:01:12.900> here<00:01:13.140> so

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
check the large text box right here so

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:14.359 
check the large text box right here so
it<00:01:13.350> works<00:01:13.500> a<00:01:13.590> little<00:01:13.740> bit<00:01:13.890> differently<00:01:14.189> but

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
it works a little bit differently but

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.670 
it works a little bit differently but
you<00:01:14.790> can<00:01:14.909> see<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.450> settings<00:01:15.900> itself<00:01:16.259> has

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
you can see the settings itself has

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.340 
you can see the settings itself has
actually<00:01:16.890> been<00:01:17.250> a<00:01:17.630> increase<00:01:18.630> in<00:01:18.780> size<00:01:18.960> or<00:01:19.229> the

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
actually been a increase in size or the

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:20.600 
actually been a increase in size or the
text<00:01:19.590> size<00:01:19.650> has<00:01:19.830> actually<00:01:20.100> increased<00:01:20.220> in<00:01:20.520> the

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
text size has actually increased in the

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.310 
text size has actually increased in the
settings<00:01:20.909> and<00:01:21.030> of<00:01:21.509> course<00:01:21.720> all<00:01:21.960> the<00:01:22.170> other

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
settings and of course all the other

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:23.899 
settings and of course all the other
applications<00:01:23.250> as<00:01:23.580> well

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
applications as well

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.870 
applications as well
so<00:01:24.210> that's<00:01:24.600> how<00:01:24.689> you<00:01:24.750> do<00:01:24.960> it<00:01:25.110> for<00:01:26.040> the<00:01:26.400> system

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
so that's how you do it for the system

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.789 
so that's how you do it for the system
itself<00:01:27.600> but<00:01:27.689> if<00:01:27.869> you<00:01:27.960> want<00:01:28.080> the<00:01:28.170> browser<00:01:28.380> to<00:01:28.590> be

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
itself but if you want the browser to be

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.499 
itself but if you want the browser to be
bigger<00:01:29.009> what<00:01:29.700> you<00:01:29.820> can<00:01:29.970> do<00:01:30.030> is<00:01:30.180> go<00:01:30.270> ahead<00:01:30.329> and

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
bigger what you can do is go ahead and

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:34.130 
bigger what you can do is go ahead and
open<00:01:30.689> up<00:01:30.720> the<00:01:30.840> browser<00:01:31.579> and<00:01:32.810> now<00:01:33.810> you<00:01:33.900> can<00:01:34.020> see

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
open up the browser and now you can see

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.569 
open up the browser and now you can see
the<00:01:34.259> text<00:01:34.530> is<00:01:34.650> still<00:01:34.740> really<00:01:35.100> big<00:01:35.280> on<00:01:35.430> this

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
the text is still really big on this

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.670 
the text is still really big on this
