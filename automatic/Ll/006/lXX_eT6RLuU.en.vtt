majority<00:02:35.110> of<00:02:35.170> our<00:02:35.290> players<00:02:35.560> got<00:02:35.680> good<00:02:35.890> analogy

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
majority of our players got good analogy

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:38.130 
majority of our players got good analogy
because<00:02:36.550> it's<00:02:37.390> like<00:02:37.510> you<00:02:37.690> know<00:02:37.720> you<00:02:37.930> don't<00:02:37.990> get

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
that far turning me and then then you

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:41.910 
that far turning me and then then you
don't<00:02:40.690> play<00:02:40.870> you<00:02:41.230> don't<00:02:41.260> play<00:02:41.530> you<00:02:41.709> don't<00:02:41.740> play
