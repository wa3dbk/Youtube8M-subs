00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:08.309
 and on this topic we continue talking with 

00:00:05.399 --> 00:00:09.960
 Alejandro Lorente Naturopathic Doctor Mr. 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:11.910
 lorente seems to run punishes 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.830
 terribly at the joints is 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.080
 this is true if it is done on a 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.240
 Asphalt surface can occur 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.220
 we also can not avoid it 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.230
 running in train or soft we can 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.510
 avoid it by not running every day 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.460
 but leaving a day in between in order 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.870
 There are many possibilities to improve 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.490
 this is but it is not true that 

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:31.890
 entry is bad for the 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.360
 input joints if one is not 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.400
 accustomed is bad if you do not 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.230
 progressively as we have seen the 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:39.300
 report also with what kind of 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.670
 training we should complement the 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.640
 run because just run alone 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.649
 well I think it's very good to start 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:48.239
 walking then running then walking and 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.160
 then on the days that we do not run 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.170
 we can do exercises like yoga 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.210
 stretches we can do swimming 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.829
 swim to back is a complement 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.660
 perfect to run because it's going to 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.760
 strengthen all the musculature of the 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:03.150
 back and it's going to strengthen many 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:05.730
 antagonistic muscles of the running 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:07.860
 what can happen if we run in a 

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:09.720
 wrong for example with a technique 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.090
 wrong with little sneakers 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.920
 appropriate good well let's notice that 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.330
 knee hurt us ankles 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.840
 we may sprain 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.940
 in short there is that you have to see about 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.890
 everything that the joints do not suffer 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:24.480
 more than necessary 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:26.400
 many people are years without practice 

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:28.350
 no kind of sport they suddenly say 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.030
 well I want to lead a healthier life 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.440
 and they rush to run 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.410
 I would recommend to you these runners 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:36.479
 beginners to say it somehow 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:38.700
 do not forget to enjoy is very 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.500
 important that running is something that 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.119
 we improve the mood all the 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.090
 day we go to run with a friend 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:47.700
 with a friend that we feel a little bit 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.530
 joy of doing something for our health 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.170
 and we do not see it primarily as something that 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.580
 you have to do with an obligation for 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.440
 example would be advisable then 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:57.119
 maybe run with friends meet with 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.680
 another type of colleagues not to talk 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.960
 my society highlighted if there is not much 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.090
 between them to go faster and 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.250
 another way when you're talking and 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.770
 running is an ideal state because it is 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.750
 fully aerobic dependent aerobics 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:13.680
 of time and having to overcome 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:15.180
 5 km we cut phobia and what signals can 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.920
 warn us that we have exceeded 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.600
 running what we have done something wrong 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.220
 for example when we have run 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:23.070
 too much time it's possible that we 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:26.370
 get constipated if one starts to 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:28.530
 lower the defenses the immune system will 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:30.690
 is affected and we begin to see that 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.730
 We have always spent time arrives 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.650
 to 34 days where we can not do anything 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:37.170
 because we are like the flu species 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:39.840
 that's a symptom for example before 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.880
 He spoke mentioned the Nordic walking is 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.320
 advisable what you recommend is very 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.390
 advisable especially for people 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:47.130
 overweight and especially for the 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:51.330
 principle so that the joints 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:53.489
 start there to mobilize and start 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:54.750
 have more resistance is also very 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:56.489
 advisable 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:58.260
 thank you very much Alejandro Lorente for 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:01.190
 all of these tips have been also 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.190
 deserved to run
