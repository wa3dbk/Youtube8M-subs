to<00:01:10.740> use<00:01:10.890> what<00:01:11.790> comes<00:01:12.060> in<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.390> kit<00:01:12.950> from<00:01:13.950> us

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
to use what comes in the kit from us

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.289 
to use what comes in the kit from us
shift<00:01:14.820> comm<00:01:15.420> and<00:01:15.450> make<00:01:15.869> it<00:01:15.990> work<00:01:16.200> cheap<00:01:17.270> what<00:01:18.270> I

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
shift comm and make it work cheap what I

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.670 
shift comm and make it work cheap what I
did<00:01:18.630> was<00:01:18.979> here's<00:01:19.979> your<00:01:21.080> throttle<00:01:22.080> bracket

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
did was here's your throttle bracket

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.929 
did was here's your throttle bracket
that's<00:01:23.670> your<00:01:23.909> throttle<00:01:24.390> gas<00:01:25.020> paddle<00:01:25.939> hooks

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
that's your throttle gas paddle hooks

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.429 
that's your throttle gas paddle hooks
hooks<00:01:27.420> into<00:01:27.630> like<00:01:27.960> that

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
hooks into like that

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.550 
hooks into like that
now<00:01:28.950> you<00:01:29.009> notice<00:01:29.490> those<00:01:29.700> brackets<00:01:30.380> come<00:01:31.380> with

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
now you notice those brackets come with

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.039 
now you notice those brackets come with
a<00:01:31.590> slide<00:01:31.920> bar<00:01:32.250> here<00:01:32.670> this<00:01:33.420> is<00:01:33.600> the<00:01:33.720> throttle

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
a slide bar here this is the throttle

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:35.390 
a slide bar here this is the throttle
bracket<00:01:34.200> standard<00:01:34.829> you<00:01:34.950> get<00:01:35.100> them<00:01:35.220> in<00:01:35.280> all

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
bracket standard you get them in all

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.819 
bracket standard you get them in all
those<00:01:35.579> owns<00:01:35.759> anywhere<00:01:36.240> so<00:01:37.049> what<00:01:37.200> I<00:01:37.229> did<00:01:37.470> was<00:01:37.710> I

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
those owns anywhere so what I did was I

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.649 
those owns anywhere so what I did was I
took<00:01:37.860> this<00:01:38.280> bracket<00:01:38.759> that<00:01:38.909> came<00:01:39.210> with<00:01:39.479> the

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
took this bracket that came with the

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.600 
took this bracket that came with the
throttle<00:01:40.049> position<00:01:40.170> sensor<00:01:40.890> -<00:01:41.009> designed<00:01:41.430> to

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
throttle position sensor - designed to

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.969 
throttle position sensor - designed to
bolt<00:01:41.880> to<00:01:42.119> the<00:01:42.200> stud<00:01:43.200> on<00:01:43.409> an<00:01:43.560> L<00:01:43.710> a<00:01:43.740> bra

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
bolt to the stud on an L a bra

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.609 
bolt to the stud on an L a bra
carburetor<00:01:44.520> and<00:01:44.790> I<00:01:45.360> put<00:01:45.600> it<00:01:45.720> under<00:01:45.930> here<00:01:46.380> and

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
carburetor and I put it under here and

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.410 
carburetor and I put it under here and
locked<00:01:46.860> it<00:01:47.009> down<00:01:47.040> with<00:01:47.340> the<00:01:47.430> two<00:01:47.610> screws<00:01:47.850> so<00:01:48.360> it

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
locked it down with the two screws so it

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.749 
locked it down with the two screws so it
meant<00:01:48.659> that<00:01:48.930> I<00:01:49.560> can<00:01:49.829> slide<00:01:50.130> this<00:01:50.460> throttle

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
meant that I can slide this throttle

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.389 
meant that I can slide this throttle
position<00:01:50.970> sensor<00:01:51.689> back<00:01:51.960> or<00:01:52.259> forward<00:01:52.740> and<00:01:52.920> by

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
position sensor back or forward and by

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:56.630 
position sensor back or forward and by
turning<00:01:53.820> it<00:01:53.970> this<00:01:54.119> way<00:01:54.920> the<00:01:55.920> little<00:01:56.130> inside

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
turning it this way the little inside

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.109 
turning it this way the little inside
lever<00:01:57.000> works<00:01:57.659> great<00:01:58.020> because<00:01:58.369> the<00:01:59.369> lever<00:01:59.640> here

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
lever works great because the lever here

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.539 
lever works great because the lever here
they're<00:02:00.630> usually<00:02:00.869> a<00:02:01.110> little<00:02:01.469> arm<00:02:01.799> that<00:02:02.219> pushes

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
they're usually a little arm that pushes

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.819 
they're usually a little arm that pushes
it<00:02:02.729> on<00:02:02.850> the<00:02:02.969> other<00:02:03.060> side<00:02:03.360> with<00:02:03.479> Ella<00:02:03.689> Brock<00:02:03.990> so

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
it on the other side with Ella Brock so

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:06.770 
it on the other side with Ella Brock so
what<00:02:04.979> I<00:02:05.009> did<00:02:05.250> is<00:02:05.430> I<00:02:05.549> drilled<00:02:05.880> a<00:02:06.000> hole<00:02:06.030> in<00:02:06.630> the

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
what I did is I drilled a hole in the

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.330 
what I did is I drilled a hole in the
little<00:02:07.020> lever<00:02:07.259> on<00:02:07.530> the<00:02:07.950> throttle<00:02:08.250> position

you<00:02:10.619> can<00:02:10.739> adjust<00:02:11.039> it<00:02:11.160> like<00:02:11.280> that<00:02:11.580> -<00:02:11.819> I<00:02:12.120> don't

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
you can adjust it like that - I don't

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.210 
you can adjust it like that - I don't
know<00:02:12.840> if<00:02:12.959> you<00:02:13.080> can<00:02:13.140> see<00:02:13.319> all<00:02:13.440> these<00:02:13.590> stems

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220

eaters<00:02:14.490> around<00:02:14.820> me<00:02:14.970> but<00:02:15.450> either<00:02:15.570> way<00:02:15.810> so<00:02:16.650> I

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:16.710 
eaters around me but either way so I

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:19.010 
eaters around me but either way so I
drilled<00:02:17.010> that<00:02:17.190> in<00:02:17.370> there<00:02:17.610> and<00:02:17.820> I<00:02:18.480> took<00:02:18.540> me<00:02:18.990> a

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
drilled that in there and I took me a

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:22.490 
drilled that in there and I took me a
piece<00:02:19.260> of<00:02:19.440> spring<00:02:20.840> material<00:02:21.840> it's<00:02:22.050> actually<00:02:22.440> a

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
piece of spring material it's actually a

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.260 
piece of spring material it's actually a
spring<00:02:22.890> a<00:02:23.100> throttle<00:02:23.400> position<00:02:23.490> spring<00:02:24.030> and<00:02:24.210> I

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
spring a throttle position spring and I

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:25.940 
spring a throttle position spring and I
took<00:02:24.480> this<00:02:24.690> cable<00:02:25.110> because<00:02:25.290> it's<00:02:25.470> strong<00:02:25.740> it's

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
took this cable because it's strong it's

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.180 
took this cable because it's strong it's
also<00:02:26.160> got<00:02:26.520> give<00:02:26.850> and<00:02:27.210> I<00:02:27.930> put<00:02:28.110> it<00:02:28.230> in<00:02:28.350> there<00:02:28.530> I'm

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
also got give and I put it in there I'm

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:30.620 
also got give and I put it in there I'm
mounting<00:02:29.430> me<00:02:29.670> a<00:02:29.700> little<00:02:29.910> stud<00:02:30.210> here<00:02:30.480> on<00:02:30.570> the
