00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:15.690
 today is August 9th and we are shooting the second 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:18.380
 Part of the cultivation of grapes 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:22.680
 sapling air layering 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:28.670
 right on the bush right here on the stepson on 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:33.000
 one of the bushes dressed container to escape 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:35.579
 container is a plastic bottle on top 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.620
 which i wrapped with black film why 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:41.219
 wrapped in black film in the dark 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:43.500
 root formation and root growth 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:46.320
 happening happens better but now 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:52.579
 remove the film by the way can be used 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:52.579
 immediately a dark plastic bottle 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:01:00.989
 stepson passed through a bottle and a bottle 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:03.409
 filled with earth some time passed 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:09.470
 and now we see 

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:14.159
 the roots inside our container here it is 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:18.240
 the container and the roots inside that is this 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:20.750
 stepson almost turned into 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.750
 seedling 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:29.229
 now this container with roots that is 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:34.740
 already sapling practically we can 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:39.070
 separate from the bush here in this place and 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:44.100
 land him in a permanent place so what 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:49.840
 I recommend this stepson for now. 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:50.470
 this shoot is connected to the bush has common 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.409
 the roots 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:57.240
 I recommend not to separate it from 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:02:00.940
 bush give back to grow 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:03.580
 more roots, that is, let 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:05.140
 the roots will fill this whole container and 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:09.039
 Only then 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:13.510
 separate and land him permanently 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:16.330
 place apart from that 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:19.690
 and plant this seedling on a permanent 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:24.970
 place is needed only after when 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:28.120
 vine of this seedling 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:31.090
 already matured here 9 here she already starts 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:35.440
 ripen and let him grow for it 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:38.170
 i will leave this container on escape not 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.730
 I will separate and I will wait while eyes 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:42.850
 as much as possible, you matures 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:44.380
 after that I will separate and disembark but 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:47.500
 happen so what vine 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:50.500
 will mature very badly he for example 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:53.700
 you put this container installed 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:57.160
 the container to escape is quite late and 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:03:00.150
 eyes did not have time to mature what then to do 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:04.239
 then naturally you separate this 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:09.459
 a sapling from a bush repot it in 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:10.620
 some capacity and build up in the winter 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:14.920
 indoors 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:17.400
 in the spring to land it on a permanent 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.400
 a place 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:23.500
 or do all the activities 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:27.390
 allowing to accelerate the ripening of the vine 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:30.520
 i.e. potash treatment 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:33.370
 heat accumulation may be necessary 

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:34.450
 cover this bush or at least this one 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:37.960
 seedling 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:40.600
 which one do you have which do you prepare for 

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:44.260
 landing cover spunbond to 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:45.580
 the amount of heat increased ie 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:48.010
 basic condition 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:52.030
 quite a lot of roots in 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:53.350
 container hit matured vine because 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:59.520
 Does it have eyes and maturing 

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:59.520
 then escape winter freeze out 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:09.280
 in this way we can 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:13.620
 propagate scarce or liked 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:18.330
 you varieties and receive grape seedlings 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:18.330
 right on the bush good luck 

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:28.419
 but
