 hello everyone and welcome your boyfriend 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.250
 let's see the test of this microphone 

00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:33.930
 So, to improve the audio of 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.950
 my videos if you want to know how it's going 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:40.890
 and the rest is to know is that it's good 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.269
 we can start with the unboxing because if 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.710
 it can be called unboxing since good 

00:00:42.269 --> 00:00:46.440
 Well, it only comes what is good to be a 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.629
 bag a bag and here inside the 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.179
 microphone so good can be a 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:55.409
 boxing ss to remove it from the bag and 

00:00:51.179 --> 00:00:59.809
 that what was coming is this plastic 

00:00:55.409 --> 00:00:59.809
 of bubbles that we all like 

00:01:01.999 --> 00:01:07.030
 and let's focus what comes in the 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.920
 microphone 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:12.250
 if you have noticed it is very small it is very 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.250
 boy 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.360
 manageable 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:24.590
 Well, I think I wanted to 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:25.730
 tell them but it's not like that or if you see 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:27.590
 some men or yes but I'm not 

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:30.190
 recording where I usually record but this 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:34.310
 video I'm not going to focus on the image 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:37.190
 is what as you already know some then if 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:40.630

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:43.310
 Well, he recorded with the microphone 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:46.100
 module and good because since less than 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:49.840
 I can improve then the thousand audio 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:54.960
 videos since good because I wanted to improve 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:54.960
 so good here we see the east 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:16.120
 is an equipment object to eliminate the 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:19.420
 air and others and here we see then this 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:21.010

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:32.170
 so, well, let's make a 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.400
 cut and let's see how it works 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:35.890
 I already have here what comes to be the 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.180
 micro connected to the mobile to see how 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:40.580

 the world is already connected to what 

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:47.360
