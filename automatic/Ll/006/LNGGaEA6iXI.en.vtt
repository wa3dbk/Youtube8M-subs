five axis Saigon the way we do this is

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:16.110 
five axis Saigon the way we do this is
that<00:01:14.229> the<00:01:14.560> user<00:01:14.890> just<00:01:15.220> applies<00:01:15.520> a<00:01:15.549> normal

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:16.120

that<00:01:19.300> to<00:01:19.720> avoid<00:01:20.170> any<00:01:20.350> collisions<00:01:21.040> with<00:01:21.220> the

that to avoid any collisions with the
part<00:01:21.610> this<00:01:22.240> gives<00:01:22.480> us<00:01:22.600> two<00:01:22.870> main<00:01:24.000> advantages

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:25.000 
part this gives us two main advantages

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.020 
part this gives us two main advantages
one<00:01:25.930> the<00:01:26.290> user<00:01:26.500> can<00:01:26.740> use<00:01:26.800> short<00:01:27.250> stalling<00:01:27.790> to

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:28.030 
one the user can use short stalling to

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:30.690 
one the user can use short stalling to
reduce<00:01:28.720> the<00:01:28.900> amount<00:01:29.050> of<00:01:29.200> vibration<00:01:29.650> and<00:01:30.100> two

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:30.700 
reduce the amount of vibration and two

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:33.480 
reduce the amount of vibration and two
it's<00:01:30.880> a<00:01:30.970> very<00:01:31.150> easy<00:01:31.240> cycle<00:01:32.020> to<00:01:32.170> use<00:01:32.440> so<00:01:33.280> it's<00:01:33.430> a

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:33.490 
it's a very easy cycle to use so it's a

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:35.550 
it's a very easy cycle to use so it's a
good<00:01:33.670> introduction<00:01:34.150> to<00:01:34.390> five<00:01:34.720> axis<00:01:35.200> for<00:01:35.440> those

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:35.560 
good introduction to five axis for those

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.290 
good introduction to five axis for those
companies<00:01:35.890> who<00:01:36.400> are<00:01:36.460> trying<00:01:36.760> to<00:01:36.910> get<00:01:37.030> into
