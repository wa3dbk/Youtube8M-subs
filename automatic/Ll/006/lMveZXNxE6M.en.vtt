00:00:00.029 --> 00:00:03.149
 In particular, the situation lies in the 

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:07.400
 with the change to the digital signal and this is a detail that not many people 

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:08.239
 know 

00:00:08.239 --> 00:00:13.059
 and a change in how the signals transmitted in many people 

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:15.809
 who are not listening possibly remember that the televisions before 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:16.470
 they came 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.560
 with two channel electors one who said a hundred channels 2 to 13 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:25.500
 dhs and the others that are a glove in February gutter 2 onwards what 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.970
 it happens that all our lives the televisions and the antennas have been for 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.550
 certain optimism given to receive signal in bhf poses of the channels of 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:37.150
 doha from 2 to 13 because the main channels in puerto rico always 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:38.120
 they have transmitted 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:39.920
 in that range of channels 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.410
 and now with the digital television camera even though the numbers are 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.980
 they keep equal for example if you tune in to telemundo 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:49.660
 stays in the two but cabaret or point 1 in the case of pretty 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:52.790
 4 can open four point and so on 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:55.910
 what happens what if there is a change in frequency 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:00.310
 percent that in the channels moves to transmit in its vast majority ap a h 

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:04.920
 efe and then country that well this conjuncture in which in many people 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.880
 they realize that their antennas may not be right for 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.670
 to be able to receive these signals and I tell you more there are places that simply the 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:17.990
 new signal is not going to get this happened to me in the area and specific munar of 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:22.410
 in which simply there neither good he nor he nor the 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:25.570
 swine flu virus because definitely there was not any 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:27.220
 type of signal 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:28.700
 well to people because 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.560
 because the truth is that 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.240
 this would force people 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.439
 to take another measure for example subscribe to a cable system or 

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:37.380
 satellite but 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.149
 but not the idea is not that people are forced to subscribe something to be able to 

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:45.160
 watch television I definitely agree with you and this is something that 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:50.290
 the world in a situation that is not going to cure itself immediately because for 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:54.740
 cover these areas where the series of latrines or framestore does not reach us 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:02:01.360
 current as you know anes excit install repeaters that entails a 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.560
 additional investment by television stations something that I do not 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.359
 He foresaw that it will happen in the future 

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:08.669
 very close 

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:10.559
 opera that this can happen 

00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:14.029
 I understand that in about two years this in what 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.270
 also has as advice to digital television and bast gestes 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:22.350
 Entrasen gave after a conversation with the people of my afa is that they are 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:23.109
 who measure 

00:02:23.109 --> 00:02:27.049
 television audience levels indicate that you can and expect a 

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:31.959
 low in the total in the total number of expected that are considered part by 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:35.889
 hundred and measurable for this draw a television audience number so 

00:02:35.889 --> 00:02:38.510
 in in what they recover from that hit 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:42.030
 It will certainly be a while and I estimate a minimum of two years 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:45.390
 alice unless but I understand that a minimum of two years to pay that 

00:02:46.179 --> 00:02:49.819
 today I came back from 'that that's serious because we're talking about two years of 

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:52.759
 what if a person does not do something like sucre said system 

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:56.119
 satellite or cable will not be able to watch television for example in coamo 

00:02:56.119 --> 00:02:56.980
 Right 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:01.650
 correct is something to demand facts and you go to the page of the fcc 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:05.570
 % and not only do we also have access to this website and together with 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:09.480
 you to be able to enter your sic co uk the self-employment of the postal area code and 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:14.210
 then there you will be able to bp exactly how many channels will you act with 

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:19.180
 how much force and if you click on the name of a channel you will be able to have 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:24.120
 access to a map that lowers you to show clearly in the places where 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.819
 channels 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:29.299
 per cent vana to have audience and the dogs where or where they will not be able 

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:32.949
 arrive with your signal and is a clear indication of the impact of what we have 

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:35.969
 been talking last minds 

00:03:35.969 --> 00:03:39.269
 this smells to me in acts in some sectors and also smells like business 

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:43.999
 because then the satellite cable companies are going to make their August in 

00:03:43.999 --> 00:03:47.369
 these places because if I can not watch television in two years 

00:03:47.369 --> 00:03:51.329
 for free you will have to subscribe month to an act system or simply 

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:52.369
 I watch TV 

00:03:52.369 --> 00:03:54.680
 so it exists and in some cases 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:58.640
 it will be the business for one only for one only for one side the east because 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:00.059
 there are places where the cable does not reach 

00:04:00.059 --> 00:04:01.399
 and it will only be satellite
