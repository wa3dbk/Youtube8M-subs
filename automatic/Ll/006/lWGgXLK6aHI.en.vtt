looks like but also plug this into a USB
keyboard<00:00:37.320> or<00:00:37.829> this<00:00:38.250> optional<00:00:38.700> keyboard<00:00:38.910> dock

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
keyboard or this optional keyboard dock

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.540 
keyboard or this optional keyboard dock
so<00:00:40.110> this<00:00:40.350> goes<00:00:40.530> for<00:00:40.680> ninety<00:00:40.890> nine<00:00:41.040> dollars<00:00:41.399> and

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.020 
called vision objects so I have to do is
just<00:01:47.970> click<00:01:48.150> on<00:01:48.420> one<00:01:48.600> of<00:01:48.630> these<00:01:48.780> notepads<00:01:49.290> and

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:50.030 
just click on one of these notepads and

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:52.550 
just click on one of these notepads and
unlike<00:01:51.030> the<00:01:51.060> HTC<00:01:51.630> Flyer<00:01:51.870> this<00:01:52.110> actually<00:01:52.410> has

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
unlike the HTC Flyer this actually has

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.190 
unlike the HTC Flyer this actually has
built-in<00:01:52.920> optical<00:01:53.130> character<00:01:54.090> recognition

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.200 
built-in optical character recognition

00:01:54.200 --> 00:02:09.340 
built-in optical character recognition
so<00:01:55.200> if<00:01:55.410> we<00:01:55.530> start<00:01:55.590> writing

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:09.350 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:11.440 

should<00:02:10.010> automatically<00:02:10.430> convert<00:02:11.240> it<00:02:11.360> to<00:02:11.390> text

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
should automatically convert it to text

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:13.270 
should automatically convert it to text
and<00:02:12.050> you<00:02:12.230> also<00:02:12.350> notice<00:02:12.650> when<00:02:12.800> I<00:02:12.860> was<00:02:13.070> writing

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
and you also notice when I was writing

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.220 
and you also notice when I was writing
that<00:02:13.640> that<00:02:14.420> also<00:02:14.600> has<00:02:14.720> built-in<00:02:14.840> palm

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
that that also has built-in palm

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:16.450 
that that also has built-in palm
rejection<00:02:15.380> so<00:02:15.800> we'd<00:02:15.950> have<00:02:15.980> to<00:02:16.160> worry<00:02:16.310> about

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:16.460 
rejection so we'd have to worry about

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:19.420 
rejection so we'd have to worry about
like<00:02:16.580> the<00:02:16.820> cursor<00:02:17.240> moving<00:02:17.480> around<00:02:17.920> and<00:02:18.920> it

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
like the cursor moving around and it

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.220 
like the cursor moving around and it
also<00:02:19.580> has<00:02:19.730> built-in<00:02:20.090> sensitivity<00:02:20.870> so<00:02:21.050> if<00:02:21.140> you

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
also has built-in sensitivity so if you

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.980 
also has built-in sensitivity so if you
really<00:02:21.530> want<00:02:21.710> to<00:02:21.800> make<00:02:22.370> a<00:02:22.400> point<00:02:22.810> stand<00:02:23.810> out

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:23.990 
really want to make a point stand out

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:29.800 
really want to make a point stand out
you<00:02:26.440> can<00:02:27.440> actually<00:02:27.710> press<00:02:28.040> harder<00:02:28.720> you<00:02:29.720> know

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
you can actually press harder you know

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:32.530 
you can actually press harder you know
be<00:02:30.590> more<00:02:30.740> pressure<00:02:31.040> sensitive<00:02:31.580> so<00:02:31.850> you<00:02:32.390> can

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
be more pressure sensitive so you can

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:34.210 
be more pressure sensitive so you can
definitely<00:02:32.990> outline<00:02:33.530> your<00:02:33.680> points<00:02:34.070> and

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
definitely outline your points and

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.370 
definitely outline your points and
you'll<00:02:35.150> be<00:02:35.240> able<00:02:35.330> to<00:02:35.420> out<00:02:35.600> port<00:02:35.990> they<00:02:36.260> an

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:36.380 
you'll be able to out port they an

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:38.980 
you'll be able to out port they an
output<00:02:36.770> any<00:02:36.980> of<00:02:37.100> these<00:02:37.220> notes<00:02:37.520> using<00:02:38.420> as<00:02:38.960> a
