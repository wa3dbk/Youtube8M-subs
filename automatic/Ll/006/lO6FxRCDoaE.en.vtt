00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:12.210
 we are in krommenie 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.340
 a district of zaanstad in the 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.859
 Noord-Holland province known for 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.199
 the linoleum factory and the beautiful zaanse 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:21.180
 landscape and soon known for 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:25.590
 the invention of this century 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:27.180
 solar red the idea of ​​electricity on 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.730
 from the road network 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:33.870
 originally here at theo van daan 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:37.110
 the lab and soon parties like 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.100
 province of north holland osn in tech heel 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.960
 enthusiastic and they have themselves 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.300
 affiliated with the initiative we are going 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.370
 get started with it together in krommenie 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.600
 realize a stretch of bike path full of 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.730
 solar cells 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.890
 and in that way we are together 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.960
 first stretch in the world that 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:55.430
 produces electricity with solar cells 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.430
 and world premiere so 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.130
 to do 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.860
 will fit a lot in two themes that 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:07.140
 we are of paramount importance in our province 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.060
 have to stand the first is sustainability 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.480
 we have set ourselves the ambition to 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.280
 2020 16% of all energy must be sustainable 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:16.770
 let produce according to drachten there 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.510
 also at and the second theme where it 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.920
 very well the connection is innovation 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:21.540
 of course we innovate as a province 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.210
 not ourselves but we think it is whole 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.070
 important to stimulate innovation and 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.110
 also do that through our contribution to 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.090
 the cell takes part in the project 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.460
 like oil dead because we like natures 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:35.160
 have been innovative for many years 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.740
 that is really a spearhead with us 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:39.630
 we don't just build roads from a to b 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.950
 but we also try to introduce an innovation 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.350
 bring new concept a new one 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:46.110
 products and hence very good 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:49.550
 fits our culture and we want 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.550
 just then to sustainable infrastructure 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:59.410
 inter causes the generated 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:02.950
 electricity through the solar panels 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:04.659
 the road surface is converted to one 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:07.929
 useful 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:10.569
 voltage for the consumers on the road 

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:11.890
 or possibly feed it back 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:13.060
 public network 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:15.250
 way it can be used to the 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.110
 residents in the area in tech wants 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:20.650
 like to contribute to a 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:22.660
 sustainable society to reduce CO2 emissions 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:25.000
 in the Netherlands but also in the world 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:26.920
 to bring back such a red 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.069
 consists of concrete modules with a 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.959
 glass top layer underneath this top layer 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:34.290
 silicon solar cells that direct sunlight 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:36.670
 capture and convert into electricity 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.140
 by connecting the modules to the 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.060
 power grid 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:42.459
 may be the way in the future electricity 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:44.620
 supplying the own lighting to the 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:46.989
 surrounding houses and perhaps the 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:48.730
 cars that drive over so red 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:50.860
 originated in 2009 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:52.540
 here at tno in a brain stream that we 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:54.879
 presented new techniques 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:57.069
 sustainable infrastructure 

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:59.349
 the idea of ​​getting sunlight on our road network 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:01.930
 to catch and convert into 

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:03.970
 electricity was so appealing and so 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:05.709
 inspiring that we decided to be there 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:08.079
 get started right away 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:10.230
 How could that be what the potential is 

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:12.549
 get it feasible and also cost-effective 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:14.560
 We are already at an early stage 

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:17.470
 start designing and making prototypes 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:19.510
 and those prototypes that are here at tno 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:21.810
 extensively tested with laboratory and 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:21.810
 tested 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:31.069
 we participate as a province because we 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:32.060
 sustainability and innovation very much 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:34.280
 find important 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:36.650
 and it seems to go a hundred meters 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:37.790
 but this is just the pilot and it is 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:39.799
 of course we intended 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:41.360
 ultimately succeed making it not 

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:42.709
 only the first hundred meters 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:44.629
 can be laid out but through which we 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:46.159
 miles mutually 

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:47.989
 infrastructure that 

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:49.640
 generate energy and the beauty of this 

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:51.799
 project is that we cooperate with 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:53.720
 Three different types of parties 

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:54.950
 one side the company in it 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.930
 business 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:04:00.470
 on the other hand, research institutes 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:01.310
 and then the government on the third side 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:04.599
 it is also one time 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:04.599
 wonderful collaboration project 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:12.910
 of course it is good for the youth too 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:15.280
 clean energy so yes I see that from 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:16.959
 sit the role of uncles in the whole 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:18.760
 concept of solar otys that we are active 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:20.650
 are built in the design of the 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:21.940
 elements the assembly 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:23.890
 ultimately we must ensure that 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:26.530
 the bike is comfortable 

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:30.450
 stiff is safe but ultimately also 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:30.450
 sufficient electricity yield 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:42.320
 imagine that all over the world 

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:44.570
 roads generate such a power for the 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:46.700
 roadside lighting matrix 

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:48.920
 the traffic lights 

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:51.140
 for homes and for neighborhoods that pass by 

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:53.900
 the road or even for the 

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:55.670
 vehicles traveling on those roads with 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:58.120
 such a red we are on our way to this one 

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:58.120
 future
