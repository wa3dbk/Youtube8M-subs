from<00:02:07.509> I<00:02:07.780> think<00:02:08.679> the<00:02:08.860> world's<00:02:09.190> would<00:02:09.340> be<00:02:09.399> a

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
from I think the world's would be a

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.080 
from I think the world's would be a
poorer<00:02:10.720> place<00:02:10.920> without<00:02:11.920> Ridgebacks<00:02:12.520> in<00:02:12.730> it<00:02:12.880> I

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
poorer place without Ridgebacks in it I

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.390 
poorer place without Ridgebacks in it I
love<00:02:13.570> this<00:02:13.720> breed<00:02:14.050> and<00:02:14.320> without<00:02:14.590> them<00:02:14.860> I'd

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
love this breed and without them I'd

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.869 
love this breed and without them I'd
miss<00:02:16.330> it<00:02:16.360> so<00:02:16.810> if<00:02:17.440> I<00:02:17.620> would<00:02:17.769> stop<00:02:18.040> reading<00:02:18.489> it

00:02:18.869 --> 00:02:18.879 
miss it so if I would stop reading it

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:20.399 
miss it so if I would stop reading it
doesn't<00:02:19.239> mean<00:02:19.330> the<00:02:19.480> breed<00:02:19.750> wouldn't<00:02:20.019> end<00:02:20.230> it

00:02:20.399 --> 00:02:20.409 
doesn't mean the breed wouldn't end it

00:02:20.409 --> 00:02:21.720 
doesn't mean the breed wouldn't end it
would<00:02:20.500> just<00:02:20.739> mean<00:02:20.890> that<00:02:20.950> the<00:02:21.280> good<00:02:21.459> breeder

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
would just mean that the good breeder

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:23.759 
would just mean that the good breeder
stopped<00:02:22.090> reading<00:02:22.300> and<00:02:22.599> so<00:02:22.780> I<00:02:22.810> kind<00:02:23.200> of<00:02:23.290> feel<00:02:23.560> a

00:02:23.759 --> 00:02:23.769 
stopped reading and so I kind of feel a

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:27.150 
stopped reading and so I kind of feel a
sense<00:02:24.370> of<00:02:24.489> responsibility
