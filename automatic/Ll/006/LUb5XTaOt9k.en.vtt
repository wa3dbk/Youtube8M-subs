00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:08.809
 monte xanic the headquarters of a dream of 

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:10.879
 friends with many illusions to produce 

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:13.430
 the best that we could produce from this 

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:15.860
 monte monte xanic has great merit 

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:17.990
 to be the first winery that opted for 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:20.720
 the quality of wines in mexico is the house 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:23.090
 who has done this domino effect in 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:25.520
 Valley 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:28.250
 monte xanic is a pioneer company 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:31.070
 formed by a group of friends with a 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:32.750
 illusion that they swam upstream and 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:35.210
 putting all the passion they felt for 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:37.520
 the wine and the capacity that 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:39.350
 they found having to make a good 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:42.620
 Mexican wine and rescue the industry 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:44.500
 the courage of some people who 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:48.290
 they decided to invest at a given moment 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:52.300
 in a wine cellar to recover the 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:52.300
 identity of wine in mexico 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:59.100
 monte xanic for me is a cover that is 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:02.570
 a flower is a flower is mexico is if it 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:06.690
 maybe you can very well with that flower 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:10.290
 flourish every year and for very many 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:13.619
 many years was the first mini ass 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:16.590
 in mexico that dared to break a 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:19.979
 price scheme of qualities to be 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:22.290
 business when the future definitely 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.600
 monte xanic has been at the forefront in 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.030
 the whole process of creating a 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.649
 came after 25 years of history 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.690
 we had the wine culture to 

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:33.210
 mexico has changed dramatically the 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:35.580
 challenge the production standards and 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.259
 the wine style standards that 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:39.320
 prevailed at the time when it was 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:42.810
 founded and I think something even more 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:45.539
 shocking is that he dared to challenge 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:48.000
 to the consumer to sound with passion with 

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:50.300

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:04.090

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:06.390
