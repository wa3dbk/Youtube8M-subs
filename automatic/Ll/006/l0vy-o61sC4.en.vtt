00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:17.520
 identification we are going to 

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:19.830
 speak in the patient's identification 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.470
 we wrote down the clinical history 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.270
 in the identification section the 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.779
 full name with surnames of 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:30.509
 patient the patient 's age the name 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:33.780
 complete with last names of the parents of 

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:37.050
 both parents the age of the parents the 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:39.360
 of the parents because the trade was 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.040
 they ask, we also write down the 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.980
 office of the parents because it is 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.510
 important to know the environment that is 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.150
 faces our patient day to day 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:51.060
 we want to know how he lives since 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:53.790
 that can affect him directly and 

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:56.580
 alter your health status or hate us 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:59.880
 we made an answer to why 

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:01.590
 present certain symptoms or signs is 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:04.890
 important to know the profession of 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:07.950
 parents is also helpful to have a 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.600
 phone to contact the patient 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.729
 for which we could contact the 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.799
 patient if we for some reason 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.659
 we have some urgency we have some 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.789
 change of plans we want to warn 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.530
 something that we just learned about 

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:22.979
 the patient's family we can do it 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:25.020
 by having the patient's number also 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.880
 it is important to have the address of the 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:30.200
 patient's house we want 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:33.149
 know where you live because remember that 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:35.119
 depending on the region of the country or in 

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:37.829
 the region of the world where we are 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:41.039
 would elevate the pathologies vary 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:42.929
 customs and so on and can guide us 

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:44.909
 towards a diagnosis can you give us 

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:47.000
 clues about what we 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:50.219
 let's think about a future about the patient 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.129
 source of history remember that 

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:55.500
 us with pediatric patients 

00:01:52.129 --> 00:01:57.509
 we are facing a relationship 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.390
 doctor-patient a little different from the 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:02.099
 that we are used to the source of 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.069
 history is often not the child but 

00:02:02.099 --> 00:02:06.989
 the mother or the companion but not 

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:08.299
 necessarily means that that 

00:02:06.989 --> 00:02:11.280
 story source be reliable 

00:02:08.299 --> 00:02:12.840
 remember that the mother can have 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.120
 some psychiatric condition can 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.650
 be disoriented et cetera and may not 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.300
 be reliable you can also be 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.950
 forget some things 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:22.290
 we have to evaluate the source 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:24.090
 of information and know if what is it 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.630
 that they are telling us if it is what 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:29.130
 is truly happening to the child 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:31.590
 reason for consultation the reason for consultation 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:34.350
 in the section of the clinical history in 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.960
 where we wrote down the reason why 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:38.400
 that came to consult the patient 

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:40.920
 we usually reserve this place for 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:43.430
 specific words let's say we 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:46.410
 well remember that adults 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:48.150
 we ask, we ask ourselves the reason 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:51.240
 consult and write down as a sentence with 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:53.190
 a patient refers later or what 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:55.020
 we put in quotes what he said 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:57.360
 the patient as a doctor I have a lot 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:58.560
 headache and I do not know what we put it 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.450
 in quotation marks what the 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.280
 patient although during the examination 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:05.400
 Pediatric physical can also be done 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:07.500
 this is good to leave it as one 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.030
 word since it helps to have more 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.520
 clarity about the reason for consultation 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:12.930
 true of the patient if the mother arrives 

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:16.360
 and tells a very long story 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:18.340
 because the child has a fever because 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:20.140
 it's information for the current disease 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.760
 that follows later but we in this 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:25.060
 moment in the reason for consultation 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:26.590
 we would write fever and really though 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:28.670
 we can also put in quotation marks what 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:30.530
 tell us the companion 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:32.240
 current illness like a 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:36.410
 adult review the current disease 

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:39.110
 is reserved to score a long 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:40.730
 action a continuous description of what 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:42.830
 that was the reason for consulting us 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:45.230
 we grab the reason for consultation and what 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:47.780
 lengthen as much as possible 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:51.110
 we are going to write down in the disease 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:52.940
 current in chronological order always 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:56.120
 When possible, we are going to 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:57.800
 put when he started when he started 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:00.140
 the symptom to the patient with what 

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:02.050
 often the symptom appears when 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:05.510
 the symptom appears with what intensity 

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:08.739
 It presents what the symptom is associated 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:11.569
 with worsening what improvement 

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:13.580
 medicines has taken that are things 

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:16.729
 important that we have to take into account 

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:18.650
 during the current illness also if 

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:21.709
 the patient refers to or the 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:24.139
 Patient's companion refers another 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:26.479
 number of symptoms that appear 

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:28.120
 related to this we write it down 

00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:29.380
 in this section 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:31.479
 let's take into account that the disease 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:33.550
 current is the place where we 

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:34.900
 we guide the rest of the 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:37.810
 consult us during the 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:40.220
 current disease we should have almost that 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:42.260
 the diagnosis ready 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:44.180
 and if not then then we have to 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:46.670
 focus very well during the review 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:48.440
 by systems then and during the exam 

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:50.300
 physical but in the current illness in 

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:52.480
 reality helps a lot to orient our 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:52.480
 diagnosis
