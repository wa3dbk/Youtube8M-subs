we're<00:00:23.400> going<00:00:23.519> to<00:00:23.640> take<00:00:23.820> a<00:00:23.850> look<00:00:24.090> at<00:00:24.180> a<00:00:24.210> set<00:00:24.449> of

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
we're going to take a look at a set of

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.089 
we're going to take a look at a set of
challenges<00:00:24.779> that<00:00:25.140> you<00:00:25.260> have<00:00:25.410> to<00:00:25.439> complete<00:00:25.920> in

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
challenges that you have to complete in

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.210 
challenges that you have to complete in
order<00:00:26.250> to<00:00:26.460> get<00:00:27.439> 125,000<00:00:28.439> experience<00:00:28.890> points

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
order to get 125,000 experience points

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.890 
order to get 125,000 experience points
now<00:00:29.640> I<00:00:29.670> believe<00:00:30.060> that<00:00:30.210> you<00:00:30.300> can<00:00:30.420> do<00:00:30.570> this<00:00:30.750> in

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
now I believe that you can do this in

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.600 
now I believe that you can do this in
either<00:00:31.019> one<00:00:31.320> day<00:00:31.529> depending<00:00:31.980> on<00:00:32.070> how<00:00:32.279> long<00:00:32.460> you

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
either one day depending on how long you

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:33.650 
either one day depending on how long you
actually<00:00:32.940> play<00:00:33.180> the<00:00:33.360> game

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
actually play the game

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.810 
actually play the game
I'd<00:00:33.960> have<00:00:34.140> to<00:00:34.290> say<00:00:34.500> about<00:00:34.710> four<00:00:35.070> or<00:00:35.219> five<00:00:35.489> hours

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
I'd have to say about four or five hours

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.250 
I'd have to say about four or five hours
to<00:00:35.910> actually<00:00:36.090> complete<00:00:36.570> everything<00:00:36.960> on<00:00:37.170> one

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
to actually complete everything on one

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.990 
to actually complete everything on one
of<00:00:37.320> these<00:00:37.440> challenges<00:00:37.950> so<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:38.579> challenges

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
of these challenges so the challenges

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.310 
of these challenges so the challenges
I'm<00:00:39.149> actually<00:00:39.360> talking<00:00:39.719> about<00:00:39.899> are<00:00:40.200> the

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
I'm actually talking about are the

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.990 
I'm actually talking about are the
challenges<00:00:40.800> to<00:00:40.829> all<00:00:41.010> of<00:00:41.160> different<00:00:41.520> reticles

points and all the radicals together on

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.090 
points and all the radicals together on
all<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:51.870> different<00:00:52.230> sites<00:00:52.440> were<00:00:52.649> combined

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
all the different sites were combined

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.479 
all the different sites were combined
into<00:00:53.280> a<00:00:53.399> total<00:00:53.940> of<00:00:54.800> 125,000<00:00:55.800> experience<00:00:56.280> for

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
it now I'm going to go in-depth on how

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.810 
it now I'm going to go in-depth on how
much<00:00:58.379> XP<00:00:58.739> you<00:00:58.859> actually<00:00:59.219> get<00:00:59.430> for<00:00:59.609> every

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
much XP you actually get for every

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.610 
much XP you actually get for every
single<00:01:00.059> reticle<00:01:00.539> but<00:01:00.899> I'm<00:01:00.989> only<00:01:01.140> going<00:01:01.440> to<00:01:01.559> be

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
single reticle but I'm only going to be

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.170 
single reticle but I'm only going to be
doing<00:01:01.920> this<00:01:02.100> for<00:01:02.340> the<00:01:02.370> hybrid<00:01:02.730> side<00:01:02.910> because

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
doing this for the hybrid side because

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.850 
doing this for the hybrid side because
I've<00:01:03.329> already<00:01:03.570> completed<00:01:04.080> all<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:04.650> other

you 30 1250 experience points
everything<00:02:12.890> combined<00:02:13.250> so<00:02:13.370> we<00:02:13.430> have<00:02:13.550> to

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
everything combined so we have to

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:15.580 
everything combined so we have to
multiply<00:02:13.820> that<00:02:14.300> by<00:02:14.360> four<00:02:14.810> and<00:02:14.990> then<00:02:15.050> it's

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
multiply that by four and then it's

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:16.930 
multiply that by four and then it's
going<00:02:15.710> to<00:02:15.890> give<00:02:16.010> you<00:02:16.100> a<00:02:16.130> hundred<00:02:16.340> and<00:02:16.610> twenty

if you actually can only do this once
for<00:02:26.930> every<00:02:27.200> single<00:02:27.590> site<00:02:27.830> as<00:02:27.980> well<00:02:28.100> so<00:02:28.610> let's

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
for every single site as well so let's

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:30.580 
for every single site as well so let's
say<00:02:28.910> you<00:02:28.970> play<00:02:29.270> with<00:02:29.450> the<00:02:29.540> MSMC<00:02:30.050> and<00:02:30.350> you<00:02:30.410> get

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
say you play with the MSMC and you get

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:32.830 
say you play with the MSMC and you get
20<00:02:30.980> kills<00:02:31.190> with<00:02:31.400> your<00:02:31.520> reflex<00:02:31.940> ID<00:02:32.150> if<00:02:32.330> you<00:02:32.690> then

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
20 kills with your reflex ID if you then

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:34.360 
20 kills with your reflex ID if you then
use<00:02:32.870> the<00:02:33.140> reflex<00:02:33.560> ID<00:02:33.740> on<00:02:33.860> let's<00:02:34.040> say<00:02:34.160> something

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
use the reflex ID on let's say something

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:36.940 
use the reflex ID on let's say something
like<00:02:34.580> the<00:02:34.730> m27<00:02:35.390> the<00:02:35.930> reflex<00:02:36.350> ID<00:02:36.530> will<00:02:36.710> already

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
like the m27 the reflex ID will already

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:38.830 
like the m27 the reflex ID will already
have<00:02:37.190> 20<00:02:37.580> kills<00:02:37.820> on<00:02:38.120> it<00:02:38.300> so<00:02:38.450> that<00:02:38.600> kind<00:02:38.810> of

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840 
have 20 kills on it so that kind of

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:40.780 
have 20 kills on it so that kind of
reflects<00:02:39.230> how<00:02:39.380> this<00:02:39.590> works<00:02:39.830> you<00:02:40.220> can<00:02:40.400> only<00:02:40.610> do

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
reflects how this works you can only do

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:43.180 
reflects how this works you can only do
this<00:02:40.940> once<00:02:41.210> but<00:02:41.420> the<00:02:41.480> 125<00:02:42.440> experience<00:02:42.950> points
