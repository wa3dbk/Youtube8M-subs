00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.688
 By order of the emperor of Nilfgaard, 

00:00:20.688 --> 00:00:25.426
 You are accused of murdering innocents, robbery, cannibalism ... 

00:00:25.595 --> 00:00:29.219
 And for this, she is sentenced to die in the gallows ... 

00:00:29.934 --> 00:00:31.259
 or torture 

00:00:41.358 --> 00:00:44.283
 Do not overdo it. Take the reward and let's go. 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:45.894
 Help! 

00:00:50.155 --> 00:00:53.652
 I knew that wizards would never deny the gold of the Empire. 

00:00:55.842 --> 00:00:57.390
 A difficult hunt? 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:00.571
 I assure you it was harder than yours. 

00:01:02.128 --> 00:01:03.837
 Evil is evil. 

00:01:04.012 --> 00:01:07.698
 If it is smaller, bigger or mediocre ... It does not make a difference. 

00:01:08.532 --> 00:01:10.129
 That bitch bit me! 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:11.210
 Finish her! 

00:01:11.249 --> 00:01:12.300
 I'll do it my way. 

00:01:12.387 --> 00:01:13.244
 You like it, bitch? 

00:01:13.303 --> 00:01:14.183
 Get the hammer! 

00:01:15.063 --> 00:01:16.287
 I'm going to break your teeth! 

00:01:17.254 --> 00:01:20.287
 The level of evil is arbitrary, and the decision is strange. 

00:01:20.542 --> 00:01:23.147
 If you need to distinguish one evil from the other ... 

00:01:23.747 --> 00:01:26.020
 I'd rather not choose any. 

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:29.306
 Be quick, Geralt. 

00:01:31.067 --> 00:01:31.883
 But what...?! 

00:01:37.397 --> 00:01:38.485
 Close your eyes. 

00:01:40.874 --> 00:01:41.918
 Get him! 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:01.543
 What are you doing? 

00:02:01.889 --> 00:02:04.102
 Killing monsters. 

00:02:20.786 --> 00:02:24.570
 Pre-order now!
