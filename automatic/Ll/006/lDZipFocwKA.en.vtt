now she is up and running it took a
while<00:00:17.520> to<00:00:17.580> build<00:00:18.230> I<00:00:19.730> didn't<00:00:20.730> buy<00:00:20.880> any<00:00:21.119> parts<00:00:21.600> I

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
while to build I didn't buy any parts I

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.150 
while to build I didn't buy any parts I
mean<00:00:21.930> that<00:00:22.680> parts

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:02.619 
to run off Dell Dell motherboards but

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:05.460 
to run off Dell Dell motherboards but
you<00:02:03.310> know<00:02:03.489> I<00:02:03.849> am<00:02:04.060> fixing<00:02:04.810> this<00:02:04.929> little<00:02:05.259> bug

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:05.470 
you know I am fixing this little bug

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:09.529 
you know I am fixing this little bug
here<00:02:05.829> teaching<00:02:06.670> it<00:02:06.789> to<00:02:06.970> learn<00:02:07.149> new<00:02:07.420> tricks<00:02:07.689> to

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
here teaching it to learn new tricks to

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.770 
here teaching it to learn new tricks to
learn<00:02:10.539> to<00:02:10.840> operate<00:02:11.140> off<00:02:11.530> this<00:02:11.829> time<00:02:12.130> and<00:02:13.120> it

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
learn to operate off this time and it

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:19.309 
learn to operate off this time and it
has<00:02:14.049> so<00:02:14.530> far<00:02:15.420> it's<00:02:16.420> getting<00:02:16.780> very<00:02:16.989> close

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:22.940 

so<00:02:19.920> it's<00:02:20.099> got<00:02:20.250> water<00:02:20.519> cooling<00:02:21.530> with<00:02:22.530> a<00:02:22.560> good

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
so it's got water cooling with a good

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:29.720 
so it's got water cooling with a good
Drive<00:02:23.780> plenty<00:02:24.780> of<00:02:24.900> RAM<00:02:25.109> and<00:02:28.280> the<00:02:29.280> graphics

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
Drive plenty of RAM and the graphics

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.539 
Drive plenty of RAM and the graphics
cards<00:02:30.060> coming<00:02:30.329> in<00:02:30.480> later

00:02:32.539 --> 00:02:32.549 
cards coming in later

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:35.720 
cards coming in later
oh<00:02:32.579> I<00:02:32.939> got<00:02:33.209> a<00:02:33.239> 500<00:02:33.989> powered<00:02:34.319> unit<00:02:34.680> but<00:02:35.099> that's

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
oh I got a 500 powered unit but that's

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:39.349 
oh I got a 500 powered unit but that's
okay<00:02:36.230> I'll<00:02:37.230> look<00:02:37.500> for<00:02:37.769> something<00:02:38.010> bigger

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:39.359 
okay I'll look for something bigger

00:02:39.359 --> 00:02:42.890 
okay I'll look for something bigger
just<00:02:39.810> keep<00:02:40.109> hunting<00:02:40.349> for<00:02:40.970> 875<00:02:41.970> let's<00:02:42.599> just<00:02:42.840> go

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
just keep hunting for 875 let's just go

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.369 
just keep hunting for 875 let's just go
get<00:02:43.079> it<00:02:43.290> I<00:02:43.439> can<00:02:44.159> pop<00:02:44.340> in<00:02:44.959> biggest<00:02:45.959> graphics

00:02:46.369 --> 00:02:46.379 
get it I can pop in biggest graphics

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:49.940 
get it I can pop in biggest graphics
card<00:02:46.620> I<00:02:46.739> could<00:02:46.950> get<00:02:47.269> because<00:02:48.469> I'll<00:02:49.469> pop<00:02:49.650> in<00:02:49.829> the

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
card I could get because I'll pop in the

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:54.830 
card I could get because I'll pop in the
five<00:02:50.250> emitter<00:02:51.319> if<00:02:52.319> I<00:02:52.409> pop<00:02:52.680> in<00:02:52.920> at<00:02:53.159> 69<00:02:53.760> 70<00:02:54.239> it'll

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
five emitter if I pop in at 69 70 it'll

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.500 
five emitter if I pop in at 69 70 it'll
take<00:02:54.989> all<00:02:55.230> its<00:02:55.379> power<00:02:55.790> and<00:02:56.790> would<00:02:57.030> be<00:02:57.209> barely

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
take all its power and would be barely

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:06.839 
take all its power and would be barely
any<00:02:57.750> left<00:02:58.049> to<00:02:58.169> operate<00:02:58.530> this<00:02:58.709> thing

00:03:06.839 --> 00:03:06.849 

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:13.580 

there's<00:03:07.849> the<00:03:08.030> back<00:03:08.209> panel

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:19.490 

it's<00:03:14.790> crap

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:28.130 

and<00:03:20.500> there's<00:03:20.709> the<00:03:20.890> time

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:30.470 

and<00:03:28.650> top<00:03:28.950> it<00:03:29.100> off<00:03:29.220> and<00:03:29.580> all<00:03:29.700> this<00:03:30.000> stuff<00:03:30.240> going

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
and top it off and all this stuff going
