oh<00:00:00.860> this<00:00:01.860> is<00:00:02.070> Steve<00:00:02.310> dichroic<00:00:02.939> glass<00:00:02.970> man

00:00:03.999 --> 00:00:04.009 
oh this is Steve dichroic glass man

00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:07.280 
oh this is Steve dichroic glass man
well<00:00:05.009> we're<00:00:05.700> deep<00:00:05.879> up<00:00:06.089> deep<00:00:06.600> enough<00:00:06.899> into<00:00:07.140> the

these<00:00:56.430> are<00:00:56.460> things<00:00:56.879> really<00:00:57.239> know<00:00:57.420> about<00:00:57.570> if

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
these are things really know about if

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.630 
these are things really know about if
you're<00:00:58.050> a<00:00:58.079> glass<00:00:58.379> working<00:00:58.739> already

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
you're a glass working already

glass the second issue is we're going to

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.580 
glass the second issue is we're going to
need<00:01:04.290> a<00:01:04.530> Curie<00:01:04.920> system<00:01:05.900> which<00:01:06.900> requires<00:01:07.439> two

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
need a Curie system which requires two

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.550 
need a Curie system which requires two
elements<00:01:08.220> and<00:01:08.400> the<00:01:09.210> third<00:01:09.540> is<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.380> dead

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
credit glass that we're going to need in

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.780 
credit glass that we're going to need in
order<00:01:12.630> to<00:01:12.810> do<00:01:13.049> this<00:01:13.200> process<00:01:13.770> now<00:01:14.430> this<00:01:14.580> is

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
order to do this process now this is

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.800 
order to do this process now this is
very<00:01:15.060> special<00:01:15.630> dichroic<00:01:16.140> glass<00:01:16.250> this<00:01:17.250> is<00:01:17.310> not

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:17.810 
very special dichroic glass this is not

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:20.929 
very special dichroic glass this is not
fusible<00:01:18.810> glass<00:01:19.130> again<00:01:20.130> it<00:01:20.310> doesn't<00:01:20.610> require<00:01:20.820> a

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
fusible glass again it doesn't require a

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.120 
fusible glass again it doesn't require a
kin<00:01:21.330> so<00:01:21.960> we're<00:01:22.110> going<00:01:22.200> to<00:01:22.320> use<00:01:22.439> this<00:01:22.770> that

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
kin so we're going to use this that

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.800 
kin so we're going to use this that
