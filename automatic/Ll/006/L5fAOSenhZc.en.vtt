00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:52.600 
rotator cuff exercises to kind of

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:56.340 
rotator cuff exercises to kind of
strengthen<00:02:52.900> everything<00:02:53.410> here<00:02:54.510> and<00:02:55.510> then<00:02:56.230> I

got<00:02:56.560> back<00:02:56.799> into<00:02:57.310> the<00:02:57.549> the<00:02:58.540> doing<00:02:59.200> benching<00:02:59.709> but

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
got back into the the doing benching but

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:05.940 
got back into the the doing benching but
it<00:03:00.069> was<00:03:00.280> a<00:03:00.310> I<00:03:00.790> only<00:03:01.510> used<00:03:03.630> dumbbells<00:03:04.630> and<00:03:05.049> I

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
it was a I only used dumbbells and I

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:10.110 
it was a I only used dumbbells and I
used<00:03:06.700> the<00:03:06.880> hoist<00:03:07.120> because<00:03:07.720> it<00:03:07.870> was<00:03:09.000> you<00:03:10.000> know

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:10.120 
used the hoist because it was you know

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.330 
used the hoist because it was you know
the<00:03:10.329> stretch<00:03:10.690> I<00:03:10.959> could<00:03:11.170> go<00:03:11.319> far<00:03:11.650> back<00:03:11.889> and<00:03:12.250> I

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
the stretch I could go far back and I

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:15.360 
the stretch I could go far back and I
put<00:03:12.760> rear<00:03:13.269> a<00:03:13.480> kit<00:03:13.780> so<00:03:14.109> it<00:03:14.230> was<00:03:14.380> actually<00:03:15.220> the

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370 
put rear a kit so it was actually the

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:18.300 
put rear a kit so it was actually the
hoist<00:03:15.579> was<00:03:15.880> a<00:03:15.910> big<00:03:16.180> help<00:03:16.620> because<00:03:17.620> you<00:03:18.130> know<00:03:18.250> it

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
hoist was a big help because you know it

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:20.520 
hoist was a big help because you know it
didn't<00:03:18.549> put<00:03:18.730> that<00:03:18.880> much<00:03:19.090> she<00:03:19.359> put<00:03:19.810> tension<00:03:20.380> as

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
didn't put that much she put tension as

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:22.770 
didn't put that much she put tension as
much<00:03:20.769> as<00:03:20.950> you<00:03:21.069> want<00:03:21.280> it<00:03:21.400> and<00:03:21.579> put<00:03:22.239> it<00:03:22.329> back<00:03:22.510> up

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:22.780 
much as you want it and put it back up

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:26.180 
much as you want it and put it back up
so<00:03:23.160> the<00:03:24.160> hoist<00:03:24.400> was<00:03:24.700> actually<00:03:25.299> a<00:03:25.329> big<00:03:25.630> help<00:03:25.900> for

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
so the hoist was actually a big help for

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:30.629 
so the hoist was actually a big help for
chest<00:03:27.190> and<00:03:27.430> shoulders<00:03:28.000> so<00:03:28.959> I<00:03:29.440> did<00:03:30.370> a<00:03:30.400> lot<00:03:30.609> of

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:30.639 
chest and shoulders so I did a lot of

00:03:30.639 --> 00:03:34.649 
chest and shoulders so I did a lot of
hoist<00:03:31.000> a<00:03:31.389> lot<00:03:31.540> of<00:03:31.659> dumbbells<00:03:33.330> but<00:03:34.330> you<00:03:34.540> know

00:03:34.649 --> 00:03:34.659 
hoist a lot of dumbbells but you know

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:40.500 
hoist a lot of dumbbells but you know
that<00:03:34.900> the<00:03:35.049> my<00:03:35.230> PEC<00:03:35.560> it<00:03:35.890> was<00:03:36.069> not<00:03:38.939> it<00:03:39.939> was<00:03:40.120> it

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.510 
that the my PEC it was not it was it

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:43.789 
that the my PEC it was not it was it
would<00:03:40.750> give<00:03:40.989> out<00:03:41.200> this<00:03:41.590> side<00:03:41.830> would<00:03:42.069> give<00:03:42.340> out

00:03:43.789 --> 00:03:43.799 
would give out this side would give out

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:46.860 
would give out this side would give out
before<00:03:44.799> they<00:03:44.950> side<00:03:45.220> like<00:03:45.879> the<00:03:46.030> fatigue<00:03:46.510> would

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:46.870 
before they side like the fatigue would

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:49.259 
before they side like the fatigue would
when<00:03:47.709> I<00:03:47.739> would<00:03:48.099> start<00:03:48.370> doing<00:03:48.489> chest<00:03:48.819> and<00:03:49.030> we're

00:03:49.259 --> 00:03:49.269 
when I would start doing chest and we're

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:51.770 
when I would start doing chest and we're
talking<00:03:49.480> about<00:03:49.780> you<00:03:50.230> know<00:03:50.379> this<00:03:51.099> is<00:03:51.159> like<00:03:51.370> now

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:04.350 
doing chest press and all that so now
that<00:04:02.709> I'm<00:04:03.010> doing<00:04:03.189> chest<00:04:03.640> press<00:04:03.909> well<00:04:04.180> this

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:04.360 
that I'm doing chest press well this

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:06.509 
that I'm doing chest press well this
side<00:04:04.569> fatigues<00:04:05.140> and<00:04:05.560> and<00:04:05.890> it<00:04:06.069> gives<00:04:06.310> out

00:04:06.509 --> 00:04:06.519 
side fatigues and and it gives out

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:09.509 
side fatigues and and it gives out
quicker<00:04:07.480> than<00:04:07.780> this<00:04:07.959> side<00:04:08.200> and<00:04:08.500> that<00:04:09.129> took<00:04:09.370> a

00:04:09.509 --> 00:04:09.519 
quicker than this side and that took a

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:13.949 
quicker than this side and that took a
little<00:04:09.640> while<00:04:09.909> to<00:04:09.970> go<00:04:10.870> away<00:04:11.019> I<00:04:11.560> mean<00:04:11.860> I<00:04:12.959> must

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:13.959 
little while to go away I mean I must

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:19.740 
little while to go away I mean I must
have<00:04:14.049> been<00:04:14.260> like<00:04:16.289> maybe<00:04:17.289> up<00:04:18.039> to<00:04:18.099> a<00:04:18.340> year<00:04:18.750> where

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:19.750 
have been like maybe up to a year where

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:23.520 
have been like maybe up to a year where
it<00:04:20.169> started<00:04:20.859> feeling<00:04:21.099> better<00:04:21.570> so<00:04:22.570> it<00:04:22.870> does

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:23.530 
it started feeling better so it does

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:28.560 
it started feeling better so it does
take<00:04:23.860> time<00:04:24.219> for<00:04:24.820> recovery<00:04:27.060> you<00:04:28.060> know<00:04:28.090> not<00:04:28.330> so

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:28.570 
take time for recovery you know not so

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:31.050 
take time for recovery you know not so
much<00:04:28.750> to<00:04:29.020> heal<00:04:29.380> but<00:04:29.680> maybe<00:04:29.860> the<00:04:30.070> muscle<00:04:30.550> for<00:04:30.940> it

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:31.060 
much to heal but maybe the muscle for it

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:33.810 
much to heal but maybe the muscle for it
to<00:04:31.240> regain<00:04:32.169> its<00:04:32.409> strength<00:04:32.469> and<00:04:33.310> stuff<00:04:33.610> like

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:33.820 
to regain its strength and stuff like

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:37.780 
to regain its strength and stuff like
that<00:04:34.469> it<00:04:35.469> does<00:04:35.860> take<00:04:36.130> time

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:37.790 
that it does take time

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:41.380 
that it does take time
so<00:04:38.720> that<00:04:38.960> yeah<00:04:39.200> that<00:04:39.380> took<00:04:39.590> me<00:04:39.800> about<00:04:40.360> two<00:04:41.360> I

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:41.390 
so that yeah that took me about two I

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:43.540 
so that yeah that took me about two I
want<00:04:41.990> to<00:04:42.050> say<00:04:42.200> it<00:04:42.320> took<00:04:42.470> about<00:04:42.620> a<00:04:42.740> year<00:04:42.860> maybe<00:04:43.400> a

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:43.550 
want to say it took about a year maybe a

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:46.030 
want to say it took about a year maybe a
little<00:04:43.730> bit<00:04:43.940> longer<00:04:44.180> than<00:04:44.480> a<00:04:44.510> year<00:04:44.780> for<00:04:45.230> that

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:46.040 
little bit longer than a year for that

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:48.460 
little bit longer than a year for that
kind<00:04:46.460> of<00:04:46.550> fatigue<00:04:46.970> 'no<00:04:47.210> stew<00:04:47.450> go<00:04:47.600> away<00:04:47.870> you

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:48.470
