00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:12.090
 is fifa intends a human culture that 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.710
 whether permanent or lasting 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.690
 then our concept of 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.480
 sustainability it is allied to this 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:22.279
 capacity need at least 84 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:24.750
 from basic human feeding to water 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:25.859
 energy and housing by time 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.340
 undetermined 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:32.070
 our paths are all made with 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:35.930
 reuse of marble work, then we 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:40.050
 takes the trash from others and turns them into luxury 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:43.230
 here is done with the soil of the site itself 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.700
 are we dug the holes in the 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.539
 rainwater harvesting generated this 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.149
 Earth 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.620
 besides thinking about the material that is 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.239
 fundamental you have more material 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.739
 but you also have to think about the 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.969
 architectural solutions 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.789
 This house is a great example of this. 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:59.640
 because it is endowed with windows picking up 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:03.120
 all natural lighting and windows 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:05.369
 they are geared predominantly 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.369
 so in this house you do not have to turn on the light 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.689
 during the day and not turn conditioned 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.150
 fan because it has a circulation 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:13.470
 natural of the months what leaves with great 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.509
 climate 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.960
 we have a cold bath toilet 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:20.040
 instead of using the water in the discharge 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:23.280
 uses sawdust 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.090
 when I mix feces and urine with 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.580
 sawdust 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.979
 I give food is ideal nutrition 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.890
 ideal for it to be inoculated here 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:34.530
 with bacteria are present in the whole air 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.750
 nature that will compose this here 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.220
 When I open this door and only when I 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.920
 leaves fertilizer point 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.259
 so instead of having a problem choose the 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.939
 Commission does not produce a product that 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:47.189
 pass in the minotaur and turn one of 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:50.790
 earthworm has even economic value 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:51.979
 there is a challenge of trying to 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.720
 with rainwater 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:56.430
 there the way we were to build tanks 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.530
 why to store the amount of 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.810
 enough water to pass the water 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.390
 dry with that water I placed it 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:06.090
 own motorcycle magistrate I bring water 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:08.460
 without much expense is a well 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:11.040
 very simple to do 

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:12.750
 and is a high point of land here I 

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:15.570
 I can distribute to the farm without 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:17.850
 need to expend energy 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:19.770
 we needed a reservoir of 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:20.700
 water to irrigate the nursery of 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:22.620
 ornamental 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.030
 the police also try to get a box 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.880
 problem was solved. 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:29.010
 decided to make a live login in 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:31.080
 this lake we create fish that 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:33.630
 people use for food as a 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.970
 living lake is not only the creation of fish 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:37.860
 We have some of these classes when we 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:40.020
 they proliferate turned into chicken food 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.800
 who are here for five meters here 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:43.050
 side 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:45.750
 we have a water full of matter 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:47.370
 then the organic primary function either 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:49.260
 irrigation of the nursery added value 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.840
 great quality for her and besides taking 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:54.090
 water takes the nutrients of the event 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.340
 of the roots of classes on the streets of classes 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:59.040
 and net of composition of the parties 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:01.320
 fish carrying richer water 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:03.180
 also saw the landscape element 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:05.460
 an element that has contributed to the 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:08.190
 microclimate during the dry season 

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:09.780
 this line difference here and saw a 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:11.040
 pedagogical element to show for the 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:13.170
 how can we do 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.700
 good use of water then what was to 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:17.090
 simply be a water tank 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:19.680
 added six more functions 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:21.090
 I like to say that within the city the 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:25.020
 main action for sustainability 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:27.210
 to conscious consumption I'm going to buy 12 

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:29.400
 western regions and beans 1 

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:31.770
 neither is organic but one comes 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.930
 there from the bay and another came from brazland 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:36.000
 so wanted to brazil traveled a lot 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:38.520
 less oil much less oil is not 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.710
 more sustainable than the other, I 

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:42.840
 I will choose our food in 

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:44.520
 function of the season that we are when 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:48.250
 We're talking about conscious consumption. 

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:50.530
 it's not just a matter of taking the bag 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:52.420
 do not acomeg instead of a plastic bag that 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:54.670
 I 'm going motor that I'm going to put inside the 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:56.830
 bag that imports much more than one 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:58.300
 plastic bag actually preserve the 

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:00.640
 nature is not preserving the forest 

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:02.740
 Amazon it is far not the park 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:06.360
 the plains of the herdsmen who speak to 200 km 

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:06.360
 management is to preserve my day to day
