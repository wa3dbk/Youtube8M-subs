00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
my opinion as well someone who gets on

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.580 
my opinion as well someone who gets on
the<00:01:30.150> ball<00:01:30.329> links<00:01:30.990> the<00:01:31.079> midfield<00:01:31.380> and<00:01:31.530> attack

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
know also the England have got perhaps

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:48.870

the<00:02:47.650> bigger<00:02:47.800> names<00:02:47.980> the<00:02:48.250> bigger<00:02:48.400> household

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:54.960 
yeah I think that that they'll want to
prove<00:02:53.740> a<00:02:53.860> point<00:02:54.010> and<00:02:54.190> try<00:02:54.400> and<00:02:54.460> get<00:02:54.790> one<00:02:54.910> over

them<00:02:55.270> that's<00:02:55.420> for<00:02:55.480> sure<00:02:55.690> and<00:02:56.350> why<00:02:56.770> do<00:02:56.830> you

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:56.920 
them that's for sure and why do you

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.040 
them that's for sure and why do you
think<00:02:57.040> Roy<00:02:57.220> Hodgson<00:02:57.670> has<00:02:57.760> brought<00:02:58.570> to<00:02:58.810> he's

00:02:59.040 --> 00:02:59.050 
think Roy Hodgson has brought to he's

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:00.570 
think Roy Hodgson has brought to he's
been<00:02:59.380> there<00:02:59.560> a<00:02:59.590> year<00:02:59.800> now<00:03:00.040> I<00:03:00.070> think<00:03:00.400> he's

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:00.580 
been there a year now I think he's

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:02.730

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:06.570 
Roy's done a very good job I think he's
brought<00:03:04.450> stability<00:03:05.040> organization<00:03:06.040> and

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:06.580 
brought stability organization and

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:08.460 
brought stability organization and
discipline<00:03:07.090> to<00:03:07.240> the<00:03:07.360> camp<00:03:07.570> and<00:03:07.810> he's<00:03:08.260> put<00:03:08.440> a

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
discipline to the camp and he's put a

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:09.990 
discipline to the camp and he's put a
smile<00:03:08.710> back<00:03:08.740> on<00:03:08.920> the<00:03:09.130> foot<00:03:09.310> the<00:03:09.490> players<00:03:09.700> faces

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
smile back on the foot the players faces

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.300 
smile back on the foot the players faces
i<00:03:10.300> think<00:03:10.450> they<00:03:10.540> seem<00:03:10.780> relaxed<00:03:11.290> i<00:03:11.680> think

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
i think they seem relaxed i think

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:13.500 
i think they seem relaxed i think
bringing<00:03:12.520> in<00:03:12.670> Gary<00:03:12.850> Neville<00:03:13.060> was<00:03:13.270> a<00:03:13.300> good

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.510 
bringing in Gary Neville was a good

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:15.270 
bringing in Gary Neville was a good
appointment<00:03:13.720> as<00:03:14.320> well<00:03:14.620> I<00:03:14.650> think<00:03:14.860> he's<00:03:15.040> a<00:03:15.070> good

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280 
appointment as well I think he's a good

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:16.680 
appointment as well I think he's a good
link<00:03:15.489> between<00:03:15.850> the<00:03:15.970> players<00:03:16.209> and<00:03:16.300> the

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:16.690 
link between the players and the

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:18.660 
link between the players and the
coaching<00:03:17.110> staff<00:03:17.140> because<00:03:18.040> he's<00:03:18.190> obviously

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:18.670 
coaching staff because he's obviously

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:20.400 
coaching staff because he's obviously
not<00:03:18.850> like<00:03:19.090> that<00:03:19.270> long<00:03:19.510> ago<00:03:19.870> being<00:03:20.140> a<00:03:20.200> player

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:20.410 
not like that long ago being a player

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:23.400 
not like that long ago being a player
himself<00:03:21.180> so<00:03:22.180> I<00:03:22.239> think<00:03:22.420> he's<00:03:22.510> done<00:03:22.660> a<00:03:22.690> good<00:03:23.350> job

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:23.410 
himself so I think he's done a good job

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:26.870 
himself so I think he's done a good job
so<00:03:23.590> far<00:03:23.739> away<00:03:24.160> how'd<00:03:24.940> you<00:03:25.090> see<00:03:25.180> the<00:03:25.300> game<00:03:25.450> going

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
so far away how'd you see the game going

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.820 
so far away how'd you see the game going
for<00:03:27.880> nill<00:03:28.060> Island<00:03:28.750> probably<00:03:29.410> something<00:03:29.709> like

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:29.830 
for nill Island probably something like

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:34.290 
for nill Island probably something like
that<00:03:31.020> no<00:03:32.020> but<00:03:32.709> I<00:03:32.739> I<00:03:32.950> think<00:03:33.489> I<00:03:33.640> think<00:03:33.880> England<00:03:34.150> go

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:34.300 
that no but I I think I think England go

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:36.240 
that no but I I think I think England go
into<00:03:34.540> it<00:03:34.660> as<00:03:34.750> massive<00:03:35.140> favorites<00:03:35.800> no<00:03:35.920> question

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.250 
into it as massive favorites no question

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:39.750 
into it as massive favorites no question
about<00:03:36.340> that<00:03:36.489> but<00:03:36.670> I<00:03:38.250> wouldn't<00:03:39.250> surprise<00:03:39.550> they

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:39.760 
about that but I wouldn't surprise they

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:42.150 
about that but I wouldn't surprise they
thought<00:03:39.940> if<00:03:40.060> I<00:03:40.239> then<00:03:40.360> get<00:03:40.540> result<00:03:40.900> on<00:03:41.080> and<00:03:41.320> you

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:42.160 
thought if I then get result on and you

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:44.040
