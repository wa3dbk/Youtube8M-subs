00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.240
 in the cinema if they want to learn how to do 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:07.160
 this card keep watching the video 

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:08.870
 The first thing we will do is take 

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:11.209
 our cardboard and in the part of 

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:13.280
 above we will mark in 4 centimeters and 8 

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:15.679
 centimeters we will also do it in the 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:17.250
 part of below and then we will join these 

00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:21.410
 lines 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.410
 in this way we will have two strips 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:26.740
 now we will start to draw on these 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:28.570
 two strips the way we want to 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:31.330
 I'm going to make some little hearts 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:32.800
 spiral a few circles you go to 

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:36.430
 do what they want or can be avoided 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:40.210
 this step if you use scrapbook paper 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:42.129
 or decorative paper also what I did 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:44.640
 was to take a white marker and do 

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:44.640
 the little dots 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:52.530
 then along all the two strips 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.909
 you have to mark each one centimeters 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.549
 both on the top and on the 

00:00:53.909 --> 00:00:59.239
 part of below and then we will join these 

00:00:56.549 --> 00:00:59.239
 lines 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:01.560
 ah 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:07.360
 we will remain in this way 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:10.150
 now to join these lines in each 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:12.160
 centimeter we will take a pen that does not 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:16.080
 work or have no ink and 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:16.080
 we will mark the lines 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:22.140
 we will remain in this way 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:29.060
 now we will cut our two strips of 4 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.060
 centimeters as we said 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:36.780
 and we will start to mark the folds what 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.230
 we will do 1 down and another one 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.400
 up accordion thus 

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:43.910
 we have to do this with our 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.910
 two lifes 

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:49.550
 once we have them we are going to take 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:52.660
 each end of the strip and what 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:52.660
 we will glue each other 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:59.960
 the other two extremes we will join them 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:01.270
 this mode and we will also glue them 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:05.789
 to 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:05.789
 in this way we will have a recipe 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:14.840
 now we will take a sheet din a4 and the 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.880
 we will fold in half this sheet will 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.710
 we can make the color contours 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:22.520
 black with a marker and with the help of 

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:24.860
 the rules now on the bottom of 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:28.180
 our rosette we will apply the mind and 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.180
 we will stick it on our sheet 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:33.100
 we will take two toothpicks and 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:35.130
 also our decorative ribbons or 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:39.780
 washi teis and we do not simply have 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:42.069
 we will take pieces of colored leaves 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.720
 We will take one of our bobbins 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:45.880
 teeth we will not split in half 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:48.910
 in this way we will make three types 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:50.800
 pennants in this case and I'll use some 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:53.610
 pieces of colored papers for 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:53.610
 make the pennants 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:00.140
 we can decorate the flags as 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:01.870
 we want 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:05.200
 and 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:07.000
 we can make cuts like this guy and 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:10.980
 also draw on them with 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.980
 colored pines markers 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:23.269
 then we will wait for it in the part of 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:27.060
 above our card in this way 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:29.340
 I also took graph paper and did 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:31.440
 some banner types in this way and the 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:34.560
 let's paste on the bottom of 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:36.260
 our rosette in this way also 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:39.239
 we can decorate these banners 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:41.569
 putting a fake boil around 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:41.569
 they 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:46.500
 finally we will make a circle of 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:48.000
 cardboard that is larger than 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:51.520
 circle that is in the center of 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.950
 our rosette and we can decorate it 

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:56.910
 and finally it would be to paste and finish 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:56.910
 decorate our card 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:02.700
 and 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:07.530
 good not see money as this is the 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:09.720
 result of the careful afternoon and I what 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:12.540
 I did was put these letters that the 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:14.790
 I did with the same or with the labeler 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:16.370
 as you want to call it and good that you 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:19.010
 I put a tube 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:21.199
 I hit this little star piercing 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:25.010
 and so I put it like a few dots in 

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:27.320
 paint drip plan as you see this 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:28.940
 card is quite simple and with the 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:31.520
 materials that are used are quite 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:34.699
 simple to get but this one that 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:38.000
 I did as for a friend as I did 

00:04:34.699 --> 00:04:40.130
 with wasit and around here down here 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.800
 I also put wasit so I hope that 

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:44.780
 you liked the idea we see you in the 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:46.560
 next video I send you a kiss to dinner 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:49.310

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:49.310
 bye
