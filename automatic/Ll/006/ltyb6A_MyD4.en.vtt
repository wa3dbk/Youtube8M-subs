fairing brackets from cracking we

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.120 
fairing brackets from cracking we
recommend<00:01:13.020> you<00:01:13.140> use<00:01:13.200> these<00:01:13.500> really<00:01:13.830> in<00:01:13.920> three

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
recommend you use these really in three

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.679 
recommend you use these really in three
situations<00:01:14.369> the<00:01:14.909> first<00:01:14.939> being<00:01:15.360> if<00:01:15.540> you

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
situations the first being if you

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.330 
situations the first being if you
already<00:01:15.960> have<00:01:16.320> some<00:01:16.470> cracked<00:01:16.740> bracket<00:01:17.159> if

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
already have some cracked bracket if

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.830 
already have some cracked bracket if
you've<00:01:17.790> got<00:01:17.939> a<00:01:17.970> cracked<00:01:18.240> bracket<00:01:18.570> sure<00:01:18.750> you

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
you've got a cracked bracket sure you

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.149 
you've got a cracked bracket sure you
can<00:01:18.990> weld<00:01:19.140> or<00:01:19.290> bolt<00:01:19.439> it<00:01:19.590> back<00:01:19.619> together<00:01:19.860> but

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
can weld or bolt it back together but

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:21.289 
can weld or bolt it back together but
it's<00:01:20.280> just<00:01:20.369> a<00:01:20.490> matter<00:01:20.520> of<00:01:20.729> time<00:01:20.970> till<00:01:21.000> it

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
it's just a matter of time till it
