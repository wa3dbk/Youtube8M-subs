okay<00:00:01.079> before<00:00:01.230> we<00:00:01.439> get<00:00:01.530> the<00:00:01.620> details<00:00:01.979> of<00:00:02.129> how<00:00:02.220> to

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:02.280 
okay before we get the details of how to

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.100 
okay before we get the details of how to
throw<00:00:02.550> each<00:00:02.760> individual<00:00:03.300> punch<00:00:03.540> let's<00:00:03.929> talk

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:04.110 
throw each individual punch let's talk

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:06.050 
throw each individual punch let's talk
about<00:00:04.259> power<00:00:04.589> the<00:00:05.009> purpose<00:00:05.339> of<00:00:05.460> throwing<00:00:05.819> any

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:06.060 
about power the purpose of throwing any

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.360 
about power the purpose of throwing any
punch<00:00:06.420> is<00:00:06.779> to<00:00:06.960> stop<00:00:07.170> your<00:00:07.379> opponent<00:00:07.859> if<00:00:07.980> you

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
punch is to stop your opponent if you

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.129 
punch is to stop your opponent if you
throw<00:00:08.730> the<00:00:08.849> punch<00:00:09.059> with<00:00:09.210> enough<00:00:09.450> power<00:00:09.660> you'll

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
throw the punch with enough power you'll

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.249 
throw the punch with enough power you'll
be<00:00:10.260> successful<00:00:10.530> in<00:00:11.190> doing<00:00:11.309> so<00:00:11.929> so<00:00:12.929> let's<00:00:13.019> talk

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
be successful in doing so so let's talk

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:15.499 
be successful in doing so so let's talk
about<00:00:13.320> it<00:00:13.769> what<00:00:14.670> you<00:00:14.790> want<00:00:14.969> to<00:00:15.059> know<00:00:15.210> is

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
about it what you want to know is

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:17.269 
about it what you want to know is
Newton's<00:00:15.960> second<00:00:16.379> law<00:00:16.410> which<00:00:16.770> is<00:00:16.949> force

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
Newton's second law which is force

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.250 
Newton's second law which is force
equals<00:00:17.699> mass<00:00:17.730> times<00:00:17.940> acceleration<00:00:18.359> so<00:00:19.170> I'll

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
equals mass times acceleration so I'll

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:25.810 
equals mass times acceleration so I'll
write<00:00:19.410> it<00:00:19.470> here<00:00:19.710> on<00:00:19.830> the<00:00:19.920> board<00:00:24.170> force<00:00:25.170> equals

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:25.820 
write it here on the board force equals

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:35.780 
write it here on the board force equals
mass<00:00:26.930> times<00:00:29.179> acceleration<00:00:34.550> and<00:00:35.550> we<00:00:35.640> just

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
mass times acceleration and we just

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:42.290 
mass times acceleration and we just
abbreviate<00:00:36.270> that<00:00:37.760> F<00:00:38.760> equals<00:00:39.629> MA<00:00:41.180> now<00:00:42.180> if

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
abbreviate that F equals MA now if

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.030 
abbreviate that F equals MA now if
you're<00:00:42.450> a<00:00:42.480> physicist<00:00:42.930> please<00:00:43.260> forgive<00:00:43.649> me<00:00:43.860> I

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
you're a physicist please forgive me I

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:44.840 
you're a physicist please forgive me I
know<00:00:44.190> they're<00:00:44.430> not<00:00:44.520> supposed<00:00:44.640> to<00:00:44.789> be

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
know they're not supposed to be

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.299 
know they're not supposed to be
capitalized<00:00:45.390> and<00:00:45.600> I<00:00:45.690> know<00:00:46.010> what<00:00:47.010> I'm<00:00:47.100> about<00:00:47.190> to

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
capitalized and I know what I'm about to

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.690 
capitalized and I know what I'm about to
say<00:00:47.489> is<00:00:47.670> dumbing<00:00:48.090> it<00:00:48.239> down<00:00:48.300> and<00:00:48.780> a<00:00:49.500> little

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:49.700 
say is dumbing it down and a little

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:51.770 
say is dumbing it down and a little
misrepresentative<00:00:50.700> but<00:00:51.090> please<00:00:51.329> forgive<00:00:51.600> me

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
misrepresentative but please forgive me

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.610 
misrepresentative but please forgive me
I'm<00:00:51.899> trying<00:00:52.110> to<00:00:52.170> do<00:00:52.230> this<00:00:52.289> for<00:00:52.500> regular<00:00:53.340> people

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:54.620 
I'm trying to do this for regular people

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:57.950 
I'm trying to do this for regular people
so<00:00:55.620> what<00:00:55.770> does<00:00:55.829> this<00:00:55.949> mean<00:00:56.129> to<00:00:56.190> a<00:00:56.309> boxer<00:00:56.960> force

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
so what does this mean to a boxer force

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.819 
so what does this mean to a boxer force
is<00:00:58.320> going<00:00:58.680> to<00:00:58.739> be<00:00:58.920> your<00:00:59.789> resulting<00:01:00.829> punching

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
is going to be your resulting punching

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:07.830 
is going to be your resulting punching
power

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:07.840 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:09.660 

so<00:01:08.439> you're<00:01:08.560> punching<00:01:08.770> power<00:01:09.070> is<00:01:09.280> going<00:01:09.429> to<00:01:09.490> be

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:09.670 
so you're punching power is going to be

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:13.380 
so you're punching power is going to be
a<00:01:10.380> combination<00:01:11.380> of<00:01:11.880> mass<00:01:12.880> times<00:01:13.270> acceleration

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:13.390 
a combination of mass times acceleration

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:29.010 
a combination of mass times acceleration
or<00:01:14.200> for<00:01:14.530> us<00:01:14.740> that<00:01:15.250> means<00:01:15.869> your<00:01:16.869> body<00:01:17.079> weight

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:29.020 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:31.260 

means<00:01:29.649> your<00:01:29.740> body<00:01:29.950> weight<00:01:30.159> transferred<00:01:30.820> so

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:31.270 
means your body weight transferred so

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:32.999 
means your body weight transferred so
not<00:01:31.450> just<00:01:31.630> how<00:01:31.840> much<00:01:32.020> you<00:01:32.079> weigh<00:01:32.350> but<00:01:32.409> how<00:01:32.829> much

00:01:32.999 --> 00:01:33.009 
not just how much you weigh but how much

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:34.919 
not just how much you weigh but how much
of<00:01:33.310> your<00:01:33.490> weight<00:01:33.700> do<00:01:34.359> you<00:01:34.420> apply<00:01:34.659> in<00:01:34.899> your

00:01:34.919 --> 00:01:34.929 
of your weight do you apply in your

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:41.550 
of your weight do you apply in your
punch<00:01:35.259> times<00:01:37.469> acceleration<00:01:40.049> which<00:01:41.049> for<00:01:41.259> us<00:01:41.289> is

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.560 
punch times acceleration which for us is

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:47.190 
punch times acceleration which for us is
we're<00:01:41.950> just<00:01:42.100> going<00:01:42.219> to<00:01:42.250> call<00:01:42.460> it<00:01:42.490> speed<00:01:46.049> so<00:01:47.049> an

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:47.200 
we're just going to call it speed so an

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.870 
we're just going to call it speed so an
easy<00:01:47.350> example<00:01:47.799> of<00:01:47.979> that<00:01:48.009> would<00:01:48.219> be<00:01:48.280> just<00:01:48.459> take

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:48.880 
easy example of that would be just take

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:50.789 
easy example of that would be just take
a<00:01:48.909> ten<00:01:49.209> pound<00:01:49.390> Rock<00:01:49.689> go<00:01:50.049> to<00:01:50.110> 10<00:01:50.350> miles<00:01:50.530> an<00:01:50.709> hour

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:50.799 
a ten pound Rock go to 10 miles an hour

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:53.249 
a ten pound Rock go to 10 miles an hour
you<00:01:51.069> hit<00:01:51.219> with<00:01:51.280> 100<00:01:51.670> pounds<00:01:51.789> of<00:01:52.030> force<00:01:52.270> if<00:01:52.630> you

00:01:53.249 --> 00:01:53.259 
you hit with 100 pounds of force if you

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:55.800 
you hit with 100 pounds of force if you
double<00:01:53.560> the<00:01:53.590> speed<00:01:53.860> same<00:01:54.369> Rock<00:01:54.610> 10<00:01:54.969> pounds<00:01:55.450> 20

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:55.810 
double the speed same Rock 10 pounds 20

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:57.870 
double the speed same Rock 10 pounds 20
miles<00:01:55.959> an<00:01:56.140> hour<00:01:56.229> you<00:01:56.890> here<00:01:57.039> with<00:01:57.069> 200<00:01:57.610> pounds

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:02.890 
the way to rock 10 pound Rock 10 miles

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:04.919 
the way to rock 10 pound Rock 10 miles
an<00:02:03.039> hour<00:02:03.130> does<00:02:03.640> not<00:02:03.819> hurt<00:02:04.000> as<00:02:04.119> much<00:02:04.149> as<00:02:04.569> 20

00:02:04.919 --> 00:02:04.929 
an hour does not hurt as much as 20

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:06.870 
an hour does not hurt as much as 20
pound<00:02:05.140> Rock<00:02:05.349> at<00:02:05.619> 10<00:02:05.890> miles<00:02:06.039> an<00:02:06.189> hour<00:02:06.280> so<00:02:06.579> pretty

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 
pound Rock at 10 miles an hour so pretty

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.419 
pound Rock at 10 miles an hour so pretty
straightforward<00:02:07.450> stuff<00:02:07.659> there<00:02:08.340> now<00:02:09.340> we're

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:09.429 
straightforward stuff there now we're

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:10.919 
straightforward stuff there now we're
going<00:02:09.519> to<00:02:09.579> get<00:02:09.700> into<00:02:09.910> the<00:02:10.000> XY<00:02:10.329> axis<00:02:10.720> that<00:02:10.869> we

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:10.929 
going to get into the XY axis that we

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:12.690 
going to get into the XY axis that we
talked<00:02:11.170> about<00:02:11.290> initially<00:02:11.739> and<00:02:12.160> learn<00:02:12.370> how<00:02:12.400> to

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
talked about initially and learn how to

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.120 
talked about initially and learn how to
maximize<00:02:13.480> the<00:02:14.140> weight<00:02:14.319> transferred<00:02:14.829> per

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 
maximize the weight transferred per

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:18.600 
maximize the weight transferred per
punch<00:02:15.400> and<00:02:15.760> also<00:02:16.630> increase<00:02:17.079> the<00:02:17.110> speed<00:02:17.650> as<00:02:17.950> we

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
punch and also increase the speed as we

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:21.269 
punch and also increase the speed as we
throw<00:02:18.760> our<00:02:18.880> punches
