 green to taste 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:50.590
 garlic augmentation uses two to three 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:53.560

 coloring oil and 150 ml of water 

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:17.040
 well the first step in revenue is to have the 

00:03:11.409 --> 00:03:17.040
 meat or muscle with soy sauce and oil 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:32.450
 stir well pro soy sauce power 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:34.340
 absorb well in the flesh while meat 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:36.769
 It's taking all the time, I 'm going. 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:38.900
 put the cassava to cook in the 

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:46.700
 pressure cooker with two spoons 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:48.409
 salt is also important to remove 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:50.750
 that lint in the middle of the 

00:03:48.409 --> 00:03:54.579
 cassava to be able to stay one more plate 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:58.099
 cute a recipe secret too 

00:03:54.579 --> 00:04:00.950
 add to the cassava a pepper 

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:03.019
 This one from here, she does not boo. 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:05.209
 It's just going to give it a taste. 

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:09.879
 if you want to also put a chilli 

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:09.879
 a finger of a girl and just add her 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:23.570
 now I'll add the beans andu 

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:28.850
 water along with Calabria already cooking 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:31.400
 with another 20 minutes you too 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:36.050
 beans where no pressure is required 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:38.360
 because he is a little roll after the 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:39.800
 manioc and beans with that beauty already 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:43.130
 they are cooked 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:46.910
 now saute the meat with a wire 

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:50.479
 oil and a spoonful of paprika will leave 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:53.150
 brave her for 10min teens to 

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:57.410
 she can get a headache 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:05:01.190
 then with the pressure 20 minutes 

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:04.699
 Now after stealing her flesh 

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:07.520
 she will add this water here to her own 

00:05:04.699 --> 00:05:10.310
 and that 's the point to be able to 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:16.130
 add 150 ml + or - to withstand 

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:18.590
 pressure while the ox muscle is 

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:21.440
 cooking in the pretty pressure cooker 

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:26.139
 alley in another large pan because it will 

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:26.139
 that's when the dish will be finished 

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:33.150
 add the onion and the 

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:38.460
 broth 

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:40.910
 now just add the walk with that 

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:40.910
 beauty 

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:59.340
 add the tomatoes and sauté some more 

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:59.340
 now just add the musician 

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:09.400
 o the meat already mixed well with others 

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:12.050
 Ingredients 

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:17.030
 add the green scent 

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:17.030
 and leave to boil in the ten minutes 

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:24.870
 now let's go to the other assembly 

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:27.240
 part of the recipe for yellow cassava 

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:29.400
 after 20 minutes 

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:32.240
 This is the ideal cooking point for 

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:39.540
 manioc now just add butter 

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:42.470
 and the mayonnaise was stirring and giving a light 

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:47.310
 kneaded in cassava, it 's good to 

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:50.190
 broken into cassava is becoming a 

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:53.880
 consistency when mixed with 

00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:56.370
 mayonnaise and keeping does not need to be done 

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:58.140
 a puree will only give a break in cassava 

00:06:56.370 --> 00:07:02.820
 anyway 

00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:04.640
 it's ready, I'm ready to go with you 

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:08.250
 yellow cassava 

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:10.470
 good that the angle with the yellow cassava 

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:12.780
 I think I deserve to win the contest. 

00:07:10.470 --> 00:07:15.360
 because I chose a recipe that has 

00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:17.540
 as an ingredient cassava which is a 

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:20.970
 tooth root is here in my region 

00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:24.960
 would put the culinary 

00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:29.010
 the well-made dish would be like a body and 

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:31.020
 tasting the price of people for their 

00:07:29.010 --> 00:07:33.390
 food on its own would be as if 

00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:35.220
 it was the soul so I really like 

00:07:33.390 --> 00:07:37.440
 cook choose a dish from my 

00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:40.430
 region so that's why I think I 

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:40.430
 should win the contest
