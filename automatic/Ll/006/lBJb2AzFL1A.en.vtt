a whole-step you can do it for other
purposes

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:38.389

to<00:03:41.959> do<00:03:42.079> but<00:03:42.319> usually<00:03:42.620> a<00:03:42.650> whole<00:03:42.799> step<00:03:43.040> is<00:03:43.250> the

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:43.400 
to do but usually a whole step is the

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.490 
to do but usually a whole step is the
trick<00:03:43.670> and<00:03:44.389> it's<00:03:44.540> a<00:03:44.630> glorious<00:03:44.989> thing<00:03:45.019> that<00:03:45.350> can

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:45.500 
trick and it's a glorious thing that can

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:46.840 
trick and it's a glorious thing that can
conjure<00:03:46.130> up<00:03:46.160> the<00:03:46.250> sound<00:03:46.430> of<00:03:46.459> a<00:03:46.549> pedal<00:03:46.819> steel

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:48.620 
but also you can do a little bit more I

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:51.369
