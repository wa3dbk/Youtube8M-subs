00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:58.660 
because he argued that in order to
depict<00:01:56.509> living<00:01:57.140> animals<00:01:57.500> in<00:01:57.649> art<00:01:57.829> you<00:01:58.250> need<00:01:58.490> to

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:58.670 
depict living animals in art you need to

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:01.300 
depict living animals in art you need to
understand<00:01:59.149> anatomy<00:01:59.689> and<00:01:59.899> even<00:02:00.710> his<00:02:00.829> fossil

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 
understand anatomy and even his fossil

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:03.130 
understand anatomy and even his fossil
mammals<00:02:01.490> were<00:02:01.939> very<00:02:02.299> anatomically<00:02:02.929> correct

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.140 
mammals were very anatomically correct

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.550 
mammals were very anatomically correct
so<00:02:04.130> what's<00:02:04.429> with<00:02:04.789> his<00:02:05.090> dinosaurs<00:02:05.719> well<00:02:06.350> it

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:06.560 
so what's with his dinosaurs well it

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.230 
so what's with his dinosaurs well it
seems<00:02:06.859> like<00:02:07.009> this<00:02:07.249> had<00:02:07.460> a<00:02:07.490> lot<00:02:07.759> to<00:02:07.999> do<00:02:08.210> with

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:08.240 
seems like this had a lot to do with

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:09.880 
seems like this had a lot to do with
those<00:02:08.660> advising<00:02:09.380> night<00:02:09.560> on<00:02:09.800> his

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:15.440 
those days looked at dinosaurs as big
lizards<00:02:14.780> and

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:19.859 
of a game changer this film was and I

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:21.289 
of a game changer this film was and I
already<00:03:20.220> talked<00:03:20.430> a<00:03:20.579> lot<00:03:20.700> about<00:03:20.850> it<00:03:21.120> when<00:03:21.269> I

00:03:21.289 --> 00:03:21.299 
already talked a lot about it when I

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:23.449

talked<00:03:21.540> about<00:03:21.750> Jurassic<00:03:22.049> world<00:03:22.410> so<00:03:22.980> all<00:03:23.310> I'm

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
talked about Jurassic world so all I'm

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:24.949 
talked about Jurassic world so all I'm
gonna<00:03:23.579> say<00:03:23.850> is<00:03:24.060> it<00:03:24.299> must<00:03:24.420> have<00:03:24.540> been<00:03:24.660> really

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
gonna say is it must have been really

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:28.370 
gonna say is it must have been really
