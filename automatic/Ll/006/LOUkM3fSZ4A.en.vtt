00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:49.280 
fact that it has two cameras and you're

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.520 
fact that it has two cameras and you're
also<00:00:49.489> able<00:00:49.790> to<00:00:50.000> record<00:00:50.360> yourself<00:00:50.930> and<00:00:51.140> see

also able to record yourself and see

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:53.560 
also able to record yourself and see
what<00:00:51.559> you<00:00:52.130> look<00:00:52.460> like<00:00:52.489> if<00:00:52.940> you're<00:00:53.149> seriously

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:53.570 
what you look like if you're seriously

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:57.190 
what you look like if you're seriously
in<00:00:53.719> the<00:00:53.840> frame<00:00:54.140> I<00:00:54.430> always<00:00:55.430> shoot<00:00:56.239> on<00:00:56.450> the<00:00:56.630> go<00:00:56.930> I

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:57.200 
in the frame I always shoot on the go I

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.860

think<00:00:57.620> all<00:00:57.860> pocket<00:00:58.760> camera<00:00:59.300> should<00:00:59.450> have<00:00:59.660> that

00:00:59.860 --> 00:00:59.870 
think all pocket camera should have that

think all pocket camera should have that
feature<00:01:00.190> I'm<00:01:01.190> just<00:01:01.460> saying<00:01:01.700> I<00:01:03.159> also<00:01:04.159> like<00:01:04.459> the

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:08.090 
fact that it has 5 megapixels plus you

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:11.770
