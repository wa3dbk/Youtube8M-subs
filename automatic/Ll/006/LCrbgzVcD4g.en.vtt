00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:20.710 
question today really of going through

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:22.919 
question today really of going through
their<00:01:20.979> places<00:01:21.250> perhaps<00:01:22.179> trying<00:01:22.479> out<00:01:22.659> one<00:01:22.689> or

00:01:22.919 --> 00:01:22.929 
their places perhaps trying out one or

00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:24.539 
their places perhaps trying out one or
two<00:01:23.020> different<00:01:23.229> things<00:01:23.649> Ally<00:01:23.890> from<00:01:24.159> time<00:01:24.399> to

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:24.549 
two different things Ally from time to

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:26.069 
two different things Ally from time to
time<00:01:24.579> yeah<00:01:25.240> I<00:01:25.270> think<00:01:25.509> should<00:01:25.719> go<00:01:25.840> and<00:01:25.929> that's

00:01:26.069 --> 00:01:26.079 
time yeah I think should go and that's

00:01:26.079 --> 00:01:27.510 
time yeah I think should go and that's
obviously<00:01:26.439> the<00:01:26.500> whole<00:01:26.679> object<00:01:27.069> of<00:01:27.130> a<00:01:27.219> friendly

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:27.520 
obviously the whole object of a friendly

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.099 
obviously the whole object of a friendly
game<00:01:27.700> I'll<00:01:28.119> give<00:01:28.299> the<00:01:28.420> coaches<00:01:28.810> and<00:01:28.869> they<00:01:28.959> need

00:01:29.099 --> 00:01:29.109 
game I'll give the coaches and they need

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:30.630 
game I'll give the coaches and they need
the<00:01:29.200> play<00:01:29.380> of<00:01:29.500> an<00:01:29.590> opportunity<00:01:30.039> to<00:01:30.310> perhaps

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:30.640 
the play of an opportunity to perhaps

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.370 
the play of an opportunity to perhaps
try<00:01:30.909> something<00:01:31.329> definitely<00:01:31.719> know<00:01:32.200> a<00:01:32.229> new

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:32.380 
try something definitely know a new

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:34.529 
try something definitely know a new
formation<00:01:32.770> or<00:01:33.159> even<00:01:33.850> a<00:01:33.909> piece<00:01:34.060> of<00:01:34.090> skill<00:01:34.479> I

00:01:34.529 --> 00:01:34.539 
formation or even a piece of skill I

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:37.289 
formation or even a piece of skill I
think<00:01:34.569> that<00:01:34.840> one<00:01:35.409> thing<00:01:35.619> I<00:01:35.709> do<00:01:35.890> think<00:01:36.149> it's<00:01:37.149> so

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:37.299 
think that one thing I do think it's so

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:39.990 
think that one thing I do think it's so
important<00:01:37.810> it<00:01:37.899> defines<00:01:38.200> a<00:01:38.409> 10-15<00:01:39.189> I<00:01:39.369> don't<00:01:39.880> see

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:40.000 
important it defines a 10-15 I don't see

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.429 
important it defines a 10-15 I don't see
any<00:01:40.119> of<00:01:40.209> these<00:01:40.299> and<00:01:40.509> dipping<00:01:40.899> it<00:01:40.929> wilfully<00:01:41.259> not

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:41.439 
any of these and dipping it wilfully not

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:43.620 
any of these and dipping it wilfully not
spray<00:01:41.679> that<00:01:41.860> on<00:01:42.189> well<00:01:43.000> now<00:01:43.179> and<00:01:43.390> I<00:01:43.450> also

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:43.630 
spray that on well now and I also

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:46.080 
spray that on well now and I also
think<00:01:44.020> that<00:01:44.140> fenders<00:01:44.679> give<00:01:44.920> managers<00:01:45.489> options

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.090 
think that fenders give managers options

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:47.399 
think that fenders give managers options
to<00:01:46.239> do<00:01:46.360> different<00:01:46.750> things<00:01:46.810> with<00:01:47.079> younger

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:47.409 
to do different things with younger

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:50.309 
to do different things with younger
players<00:01:47.679> but<00:01:48.069> all<00:01:48.189> these<00:01:48.869> teenagers<00:01:49.869> coming

00:01:50.309 --> 00:01:50.319 
players but all these teenagers coming

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:51.660 
players but all these teenagers coming

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:51.670 
through the academies now they've got to

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:57.570 
through the academies now they've got to
be<00:01:51.729> blooded<00:01:52.090> at<00:01:52.209> some<00:01:52.420> stage<00:01:52.689> like<00:01:52.989> today

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:57.580 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:00.070 

well<00:01:58.580> I<00:01:58.610> wonder<00:01:58.970> what<00:01:59.240> first-half<00:01:59.750> we've<00:01:59.930> got
