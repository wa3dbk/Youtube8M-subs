flower or you can do what I did and make

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.550 
flower or you can do what I did and make
another<00:01:05.189> color<00:01:05.549> by<00:01:05.939> cutting<00:01:06.689> another<00:01:07.020> piece

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
another color by cutting another piece

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.710 
another color by cutting another piece
of<00:01:07.740> tissue<00:01:07.890> paper<00:01:08.040> into<00:01:08.580> four<00:01:08.610> and<00:01:09.150> then

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
of tissue paper into four and then

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.190 
of tissue paper into four and then
varying<00:01:10.500> up<00:01:10.650> the<00:01:10.860> colors<00:01:11.220> so<00:01:11.939> four<00:01:12.689> of<00:01:12.720> these

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
varying up the colors so four of these

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.149 
varying up the colors so four of these
little<00:01:13.530> pages<00:01:13.799> will<00:01:14.280> make<00:01:14.490> one<00:01:14.939> flower<00:01:16.159> for

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
little pages will make one flower for

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.399 
little pages will make one flower for
the<00:01:17.280> first<00:01:17.520> flower<00:01:17.790> design<00:01:18.240> I<00:01:18.509> decided<00:01:18.900> to<00:01:19.170> put

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
the first flower design I decided to put

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.980 
the first flower design I decided to put
two<00:01:19.860> of<00:01:20.220> the<00:01:20.369> pink<00:01:20.670> pages<00:01:20.909> on<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.390> bottom<00:01:21.750> and

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
two of the pink pages on the bottom and

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.490 
two of the pink pages on the bottom and
then<00:01:22.530> two<00:01:23.009> of<00:01:23.340> the<00:01:23.670> yellowy<00:01:24.390> gold<00:01:24.780> pieces<00:01:25.140> on

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
then two of the yellowy gold pieces on

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.370 
then two of the yellowy gold pieces on
the<00:01:25.710> top<00:01:25.950> of<00:01:26.189> that<00:01:26.220> one<00:01:26.610> then<00:01:27.420> smooth<00:01:27.960> out<00:01:28.320> your

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
the top of that one then smooth out your

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.830 
the top of that one then smooth out your
paper<00:01:28.890> so<00:01:29.400> that<00:01:29.430> it<00:01:29.970> is<00:01:30.090> so<00:01:30.329> much<00:01:30.450> easier<00:01:30.630> to

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
paper so that it is so much easier to

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.560 
paper so that it is so much easier to
fold<00:01:31.310> another<00:01:32.310> way<00:01:32.520> you<00:01:32.579> could<00:01:32.790> do<00:01:32.939> this<00:01:33.119> is<00:01:33.360> to

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
fold another way you could do this is to

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.510 
fold another way you could do this is to
alternate<00:01:34.079> between<00:01:34.229> the<00:01:34.470> colors<00:01:34.860> so<00:01:35.220> for

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
alternate between the colors so for

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.060 
alternate between the colors so for
example<00:01:36.090> I<00:01:36.210> did<00:01:36.390> a<00:01:36.420> pink<00:01:36.720> a<00:01:36.930> gold<00:01:37.409> a<00:01:37.590> pink<00:01:37.890> and

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
example I did a pink a gold a pink and

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.460 
example I did a pink a gold a pink and
then<00:01:38.189> a<00:01:38.220> gold<00:01:38.520> and<00:01:38.880> whatever<00:01:39.180> way<00:01:39.630> you<00:01:40.110> fold

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
then a gold and whatever way you fold

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.560 
then a gold and whatever way you fold
your<00:01:40.530> paper<00:01:40.799> your<00:01:41.549> flower<00:01:41.909> will<00:01:42.270> come<00:01:42.450> out

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
your paper your flower will come out

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.350 
your paper your flower will come out
differently<00:01:43.340> next<00:01:44.340> I'm<00:01:44.610> folding<00:01:44.850> my<00:01:45.030> paper

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
differently next I'm folding my paper

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.660 
differently next I'm folding my paper
and<00:01:45.630> what<00:01:45.780> I<00:01:45.810> like<00:01:46.140> to<00:01:46.259> call<00:01:46.439> accordion<00:01:47.369> style

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
and what I like to call accordion style

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.020 
and what I like to call accordion style
so<00:01:48.659> just<00:01:49.290> back<00:01:49.710> and<00:01:49.950> forth<00:01:50.040> so<00:01:50.549> you<00:01:50.610> want<00:01:50.880> to

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
so just back and forth so you want to

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.760 
so just back and forth so you want to
fold<00:01:51.600> a<00:01:51.990> small<00:01:52.409> piece<00:01:52.799> and<00:01:53.070> then

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:53.770 
fold a small piece and then

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:56.100 
fold a small piece and then
fold<00:01:54.100> the<00:01:54.250> paper<00:01:54.460> over<00:01:54.729> on<00:01:55.030> itself<00:01:55.420> so<00:01:56.020> you

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.110 
fold the paper over on itself so you

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:58.170 
fold the paper over on itself so you
have<00:01:56.320> what<00:01:56.650> looks<00:01:57.100> kind<00:01:57.520> of<00:01:57.670> like<00:01:57.909> an

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:58.180 
have what looks kind of like an

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:02.219 
have what looks kind of like an
accordion<00:01:58.960> in<00:01:59.080> the<00:01:59.260> end<00:01:59.409> and<00:02:00.510> the<00:02:01.510> smaller<00:02:02.050> of

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:02.229 
accordion in the end and the smaller of

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:04.560 
accordion in the end and the smaller of
these<00:02:02.530> folds<00:02:03.190> are<00:02:03.310> the<00:02:03.550> smaller<00:02:03.850> your<00:02:04.150> petals

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:04.570 
these folds are the smaller your petals

again and then cut out a curved shape on
the<00:02:40.540> end<00:02:40.720> of<00:02:41.140> your<00:02:41.230> folded<00:02:41.980> paper<00:02:44.280> you<00:02:45.280> can<00:02:45.519> get

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
the end of your folded paper you can get

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.520 
the end of your folded paper you can get
really<00:02:45.940> creative<00:02:46.330> with<00:02:46.780> this<00:02:46.959> step<00:02:47.290> and

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
really creative with this step and

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:49.380 
really creative with this step and
whatever<00:02:47.830> way<00:02:48.310> you<00:02:48.370> cut<00:02:48.760> the<00:02:48.940> end<00:02:49.090> of<00:02:49.269> your

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:49.390 
whatever way you cut the end of your

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:51.720 
whatever way you cut the end of your
paper<00:02:49.630> that's<00:02:50.380> how<00:02:50.680> your<00:02:50.860> petals<00:02:51.280> will<00:02:51.519> look

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
paper that's how your petals will look

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:54.780 
paper that's how your petals will look
so<00:02:52.420> I<00:02:52.750> like<00:02:53.050> mine<00:02:53.319> rounded<00:02:53.830> because<00:02:54.190> I<00:02:54.400> find<00:02:54.640> it

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
so I like mine rounded because I find it

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:56.940 
so I like mine rounded because I find it
creates<00:02:55.150> more<00:02:55.420> of<00:02:55.660> a<00:02:55.810> softer<00:02:56.319> looking<00:02:56.680> flower

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
creates more of a softer looking flower

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:59.940 
creates more of a softer looking flower
something<00:02:57.489> more<00:02:58.000> like<00:02:58.360> a<00:02:58.630> carnation<00:02:59.110> or<00:02:59.620> a

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
something more like a carnation or a

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:02.490 
something more like a carnation or a
rose<00:03:00.329> then<00:03:01.329> you'll<00:03:01.570> have<00:03:01.810> something<00:03:02.079> that

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
rose then you'll have something that

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:05.789 
rose then you'll have something that
kind<00:03:02.769> of<00:03:02.950> looks<00:03:03.160> like<00:03:03.250> a<00:03:03.370> band-aid<00:03:04.620> to<00:03:05.620> make

00:03:05.789 --> 00:03:05.799 
kind of looks like a band-aid to make

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:08.009 
kind of looks like a band-aid to make
the<00:03:05.950> petals<00:03:06.400> you'll<00:03:06.700> first<00:03:07.060> want<00:03:07.209> to<00:03:07.420> fan<00:03:07.780> out

00:03:08.009 --> 00:03:08.019 
the petals you'll first want to fan out

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:14.000 
the petals you'll first want to fan out
your<00:03:08.230> flower

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.530 

when<00:03:15.010> you<00:03:15.160> have<00:03:15.340> something<00:03:15.850> that<00:03:15.880> kind<00:03:16.360> of

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:16.540 
when you have something that kind of

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:18.420 
when you have something that kind of
looks<00:03:16.750> like<00:03:16.870> this<00:03:17.350> you're<00:03:17.770> going<00:03:18.040> to<00:03:18.160> want<00:03:18.340> to

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:18.430 
looks like this you're going to want to

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:21.630 
looks like this you're going to want to
gently<00:03:18.850> start<00:03:19.740> separating<00:03:20.740> each<00:03:20.950> layer<00:03:21.340> of

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:21.640 
gently start separating each layer of

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:24.990 
gently start separating each layer of
the<00:03:22.120> tissue<00:03:22.420> paper<00:03:22.569> I<00:03:23.230> found<00:03:24.100> the<00:03:24.550> best<00:03:24.760> way<00:03:24.970> to

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.000 
the tissue paper I found the best way to

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.070 
the tissue paper I found the best way to
do<00:03:25.390> this<00:03:25.600> was<00:03:26.319> to<00:03:26.770> gently<00:03:27.459> pull<00:03:28.120> on<00:03:28.450> each<00:03:28.870> of

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:29.080 
do this was to gently pull on each of

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:31.410 
do this was to gently pull on each of
the<00:03:29.230> creases<00:03:29.709> created<00:03:30.459> by<00:03:30.670> folding<00:03:31.239> the<00:03:31.390> paper

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:31.420 
the creases created by folding the paper

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:34.470 
the creases created by folding the paper
earlier<00:03:32.140> and<00:03:32.410> this<00:03:33.340> just<00:03:33.700> helps<00:03:34.060> keep<00:03:34.180> your

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480 
earlier and this just helps keep your

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.120 
earlier and this just helps keep your
petals<00:03:34.870> in<00:03:35.050> shape<00:03:35.319> so<00:03:35.590> they<00:03:35.739> don't<00:03:35.980> get

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:36.130 
petals in shape so they don't get

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:38.699 
petals in shape so they don't get
crinkled<00:03:36.640> and<00:03:36.880> here<00:03:37.720> you<00:03:37.870> want<00:03:38.050> to<00:03:38.140> be<00:03:38.230> really

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:38.709 
crinkled and here you want to be really

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:41.520 
crinkled and here you want to be really
careful<00:03:39.190> you<00:03:40.000> don't<00:03:40.209> want<00:03:40.390> to<00:03:40.569> rip<00:03:41.290> your

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:41.530 
careful you don't want to rip your

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:43.740 
careful you don't want to rip your
flower<00:03:41.800> if<00:03:42.160> you<00:03:42.310> do<00:03:42.520> it's<00:03:42.700> okay<00:03:43.090> because<00:03:43.390> it's

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:43.750 
flower if you do it's okay because it's

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:46.949 
flower if you do it's okay because it's
really<00:03:44.110> easy<00:03:44.410> to<00:03:44.560> hide<00:03:44.860> but<00:03:45.610> this<00:03:46.209> is<00:03:46.480> the<00:03:46.720> part

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:46.959 
really easy to hide but this is the part

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:49.259 
really easy to hide but this is the part
that<00:03:47.019> requires<00:03:47.350> the<00:03:48.220> most<00:03:48.400> patience

00:03:49.259 --> 00:03:49.269 
that requires the most patience

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:52.440 
that requires the most patience
so<00:03:49.630> just<00:03:50.440> gently<00:03:50.920> start<00:03:51.070> pulling<00:03:51.910> away<00:03:52.060> at

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:52.450 
so just gently start pulling away at

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:56.790 
so just gently start pulling away at
each<00:03:52.870> of<00:03:53.110> those<00:03:53.290> layers<00:03:55.290> maneuver<00:03:56.290> the<00:03:56.440> petals

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:56.800 
each of those layers maneuver the petals

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:58.680 
each of those layers maneuver the petals
around<00:03:56.980> a<00:03:57.370> little<00:03:57.519> bit<00:03:57.819> until<00:03:58.060> you're<00:03:58.480> happy

00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:58.690 
around a little bit until you're happy

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:01.470 
around a little bit until you're happy
with<00:03:58.900> the<00:03:59.110> way<00:03:59.319> your<00:03:59.470> flower<00:03:59.769> looks<00:04:00.250> and<00:04:00.610> then
