00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.640 
give us another ink ornate I don't
really<00:01:36.299> like<00:01:36.509> the<00:01:36.689> incinerator<00:01:37.140> grenade<00:01:37.409> that

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
really like the incinerator grenade that

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.190 
really like the incinerator grenade that
much<00:01:37.950> I<00:01:38.250> guess<00:01:38.729> the<00:01:38.880> one<00:01:39.090> perk<00:01:39.390> it<00:01:39.570> has<00:01:39.780> over

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
much I guess the one perk it has over

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.109 
much I guess the one perk it has over
the<00:01:40.229> ink<00:01:40.530> ornate<00:01:40.979> is<00:01:41.189> that<00:01:41.400> if<00:01:41.549> you<00:01:41.759> tag

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
the ink ornate is that if you tag

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.990 
the ink ornate is that if you tag
somebody<00:01:42.420> with<00:01:42.750> it<00:01:42.960> they're<00:01:43.590> dunzo<00:01:44.310> but<00:01:44.850> it's

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
somebody with it they're dunzo but it's

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.139 
somebody with it they're dunzo but it's
really<00:01:45.360> tough<00:01:45.869> to<00:01:45.899> hit<00:01:46.229> them<00:01:46.470> with<00:01:46.680> that

00:01:47.139 --> 00:01:47.149 
really tough to hit them with that

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:51.170 
really tough to hit them with that
another<00:01:48.149> thing<00:01:48.780> that<00:01:48.810> is<00:01:49.500> kind<00:01:49.890> of<00:01:50.100> bugging<00:01:50.790> me

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
another thing that is kind of bugging me

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.450 
another thing that is kind of bugging me
about<00:01:51.210> the<00:01:51.540> game<00:01:52.020> and<00:01:52.350> I<00:01:52.740> don't<00:01:52.950> actually<00:01:53.250> I

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
about the game and I don't actually I

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:54.859 
about the game and I don't actually I
guess<00:01:53.670> I<00:01:53.939> don't<00:01:54.090> really<00:01:54.240> know<00:01:54.450> if<00:01:54.479> this<00:01:54.689> is<00:01:54.720> a

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
guess I don't really know if this is a

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.020 
guess I don't really know if this is a
hundred<00:01:55.170> percent<00:01:55.229> true<00:01:55.799> or<00:01:55.950> not<00:01:55.979> but<00:01:56.100> this<00:01:56.790> has

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
hundred percent true or not but this has

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.389 
hundred percent true or not but this has
happened<00:01:57.450> to<00:01:57.479> me<00:01:57.630> a<00:01:57.659> lot<00:01:57.990> is<00:01:58.320> that<00:01:58.860> when<00:01:59.070> you're

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
happened to me a lot is that when you're

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:00.560 
happened to me a lot is that when you're
playing<00:01:59.640> with<00:01:59.820> somebody<00:02:00.149> and<00:02:00.240> say<00:02:00.420> you're

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
only two issues that I could come up

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.520 
only two issues that I could come up
with<00:02:51.400> and<00:02:51.730> that<00:02:51.820> poky<00:02:52.270> 0<00:02:52.570> could<00:02:52.870> come<00:02:53.140> up<00:02:53.350> with

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
with and that poky 0 could come up with

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:55.800 
with and that poky 0 could come up with
in<00:02:53.710> the<00:02:53.800> game<00:02:54.040> the<00:02:54.310> incinerator<00:02:54.880> grenades<00:02:55.420> and

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810 
in the game the incinerator grenades and

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:58.410 
in the game the incinerator grenades and
the<00:02:56.260> fact<00:02:56.560> that<00:02:56.710> the<00:02:56.890> game<00:02:57.160> does<00:02:57.430> not<00:02:57.730> put<00:02:58.150> some

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420

more those are really the only two

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:08.640 
more those are really the only two
issues<00:03:07.540> that<00:03:07.690> I've<00:03:07.780> come<00:03:07.990> across<00:03:08.140> so<00:03:08.620> far

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
issues that I've come across so far
