00:00:01.319 --> 00:00:06.170
 Hello together to the goal to have a 1 1 MEDIUS around I want you in this 

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:11.190
 Video once here the photo applications post application and the setting 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:11.810
 demonstrate 

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:15.499
 we'll just start with the photos that lithium in the dock 

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:18.840
 and then I see I have an album right now if I have not 

00:00:18.839 --> 00:00:22.830
 my complete wants to go back to it because my iTunes has moments in life 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:23.749
 to 7 

00:00:23.749 --> 00:00:26.119
 Percent Kappel is when it happens 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:27.359
 here 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.529
 sedi but an album I've been shooting a couple of photos and 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:35.030
 that today what you really advertise inside and that's what it looks like 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:36.860
 to zoom that means everyone 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:40.850
 Hathor both fingers go up and it's like that from Langnau and you see 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:44.399
 then a preview of it then you can go back again 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.130
 but that is really 

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:49.130
 the coolest thing about the photo application 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:53.820
 if he then just made a photo of cancer then you are here looking healthy 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:54.769
 rejoice 

00:00:54.769 --> 00:00:58.420
 So it really is a really cool quality to look at photos 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:01.739
 presenting his friend is definitely really good 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.680
 I still have a few Avatar and Fulness around her 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.710
 if that's enough for you, you could just do it and you could 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.730
 again to old place survey if they also photos Peter will be all of you 

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:18.180
 Photos directly displayed here you can see 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.140
 You also have the option to show it all as a slideshow 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.770
 then let music playback could also be music directly outside 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.510
 except music while here is the iPod view again 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:30.880
 percent 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.280
 just like the iPod Touch 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.520
 nominate 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.520
 Some do not need a winner, but there is a possibility 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:42.920
 and still different transitions we can do it exactly what Garmin take 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:45.830
 but what is not allowed 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:46.880
 and around 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.880
 then he could just start the slide shows 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.060
 then we will sometimes see two pictures side by side 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.070
 they also overlap 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:58.009
 and more 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:01.389
 Seeger the moment is not quite so nice in this photo because it makes me so 

00:02:01.389 --> 00:02:02.540
 wonderfully reduce 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:03.860
 after that have theirs 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:04.930
 but on 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:08.989
 Anyway, I can put it in the dock and then wonderfully 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:11.989
 Just admire the way Dawson works 

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:15.170
 you can also delete a photo directly 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:18.519
 clear up here on the radar photo says it's way 

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:22.230
 Apple has liked a photo could send it by e-mail to the contact to 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:25.329
 have as background image life or photocopying 

00:02:25.329 --> 00:02:28.450
 if we just now as wallpaper and there you can sometimes 

00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:31.829
 a sword screen or home screen EM in the Main from the 1st 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:33.590
 home screen 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:35.539
 says Vollmann Hamas 

00:02:35.539 --> 00:02:40.009
 why scroll around the round commander especially when you look at what he is up to 

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:43.989
 four times photos in an album then this bar down here really is 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:47.029
 Percent an age because if you just scroll through it 

00:02:47.539 --> 00:02:50.160
 it would take a long time 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.600
 But we just want to go through it so that really fast 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:56.669
 but the iPad is really made for that 

00:02:56.669 --> 00:02:58.959
 to start again now 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:00.579
 and around 

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:02.200
 Here you can then 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.849
 again photos will be and then all copies will be a deletion or all per 

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:07.939
 Send e-mail that it is still possible 

00:03:07.939 --> 00:03:11.790
 There is more speciality that I want to show you and I have 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:15.519
 every time I am the amber made the start screen and down here this 

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:20.269
 Button triggers again the slide show, that is, way attach value and then 

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:22.069
 will be the slideshow directly 

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:23.179
 played 

00:03:23.179 --> 00:03:26.369
 You can then also how to play that back then you can 

00:03:26.369 --> 00:03:28.569
 also change in the settings 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:32.109
 and I think we'll do it a couple of times 

00:03:33.859 --> 00:03:36.440
 and that was it then the opponent so on 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:40.330
 to the settings here you can see the Tauber Valley picture what they background now 

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:41.199
 have taken 

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:43.139
 and off to the setting 

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:47.309
 here and for the general one was not exactly the same as the iPod Touch 

00:03:47.309 --> 00:03:50.309
 iPhone and so on here you can watch again 

00:03:51.439 --> 00:03:55.729
 For the work you've heard, listen to general and info sounds 

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:57.529
 Blood dead percent proper 

00:03:57.529 --> 00:03:58.970
 Location services 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:02.449
 automatic lock you can adjust everything that the same 

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:05.859
 only one thing is different and although battery charge in percent that is too 

00:04:05.859 --> 00:04:09.319
 something new at the hype something on the iPod Touch, for example, does not work 

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:12.879
 up here then one percent of time does not obscure them 

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:16.400
 you can just be issued but I think I'm pretty 

00:04:16.399 --> 00:04:19.590
 useful so i'll just let 'em do that 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:23.490
 Under applause then could also be a network of series such as brings 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:26.710
 to the internet if people ask me again like that ever 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:30.580
 goes in the settings under applause then you have your network hook 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:35.720
 enter the password which is usually found on the router Gunnar a simple 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:37.569
 Sometimes the parents ask if they know that 

00:04:37.569 --> 00:04:40.069
 and then you already have an internet connection 

00:04:40.069 --> 00:04:43.159
 here could be synonymous if the right attitude but can 

00:04:43.159 --> 00:04:46.919
 choose directly from here what play should have and Sven Voss 

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:49.659
 they were supposed to be vocal, for example 

00:04:49.659 --> 00:04:53.479
 I can do that for God's final Sunday in a sea of ​​rubble 

00:04:53.479 --> 00:04:56.180
 Just deselect women that they also appear 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:59.530
 Availability and background I have already here a bit down 

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:01.919
 You can also fix that 

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:05.509
 For example, doing so is a bizarre bit more enjoyable 

00:05:06.999 --> 00:05:10.970
 Otto I think that means up here is also a sensor in it 

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:15.180
 Dr percent then adapts so it's still dark as if that would rather always 

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:19.110
 so that also saves electricity and you can then under wallpaper 

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:20.760
 a man looks at the background image 

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:22.629
 change 

00:05:22.629 --> 00:05:26.010
 Just take a new one for the start screen 

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:30.270
 about what Apple has always shown so find lock screen Zack 

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:33.389
 and you can go out directly that you want to progress 

00:05:33.389 --> 00:05:36.990
 Here are what I have already mentioned here in this one 

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:37.860
 Picture Frame 

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:40.889
 Mode that can be activated here via the home screen 

00:05:40.889 --> 00:05:44.900
 here are two and then about w-lan and origami two ways we can 

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:47.370
 also face the suit and coincidentally again 

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:50.909
 he can listen to happen again that worried possible 

00:05:50.909 --> 00:05:55.430
 more contacts Calendar has stayed the same as Safari too 

00:05:55.429 --> 00:05:58.659
 a light just as there is nothing new but a 

00:05:58.659 --> 00:06:03.539
 at the IPO could still adjust volume and so on Tax &amp; Paste info 

00:06:03.539 --> 00:06:07.490
 our video could be on the last start that it sometimes hard then 

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:09.660
 could also say it should be on the sidelines 

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:11.509
 reproduce the beginning again 

00:06:11.509 --> 00:06:13.909
 again, it is again such a word 

00:06:13.909 --> 00:06:18.289
 and 4 that's embarrassing as far as everything about this we had different here 

00:06:18.289 --> 00:06:22.430
 EPS the percent big part they are from Apple but you know that 

00:06:22.429 --> 00:06:23.660
 even from the iPod 

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:25.180
 that she will be here then 

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:28.330
 are inside and you could also change a few things here 

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:30.740
 Keynote, what do I know 

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:31.599
 This is 

00:06:31.599 --> 00:06:34.280
 Percent that were the attitude that actually too 

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:37.510
 more extensive are definitely more extensive and also more beautiful 

00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:41.150
 designed simply by the fact that it is so big here 

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:42.740
 and then 

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:45.319
 I think the very very beautiful and definitely 

00:06:45.319 --> 00:06:50.559
 and dumb as well as iPhoto application that's really 2 percent good stuff 

00:06:50.559 --> 00:06:54.960
 in the iPad and Co I hope and instead of the video and see you in us 

00:06:54.959 --> 00:06:55.710
 Hessen be like off
