and<00:01:47.759> this<00:01:47.820> has<00:01:47.970> been<00:01:48.090> gone<00:01:48.240> for<00:01:48.390> a<00:01:48.570> couple<00:01:48.659> days

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
and this has been gone for a couple days

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.630 
and this has been gone for a couple days
now<00:01:48.990> it<00:01:49.380> doesn't<00:01:49.680> matter<00:01:49.740> the<00:01:50.159> hour<00:01:50.310> of<00:01:50.460> the

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
now it doesn't matter the hour of the

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.319 
now it doesn't matter the hour of the
day<00:01:50.850> look<00:01:51.090> at<00:01:51.210> this<00:01:51.299> to<00:01:52.200> our<00:01:52.350> queue<00:01:52.710> times

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:53.329 
day look at this to our queue times

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:55.670 
day look at this to our queue times
because<00:01:54.329> the<00:01:54.509> PTR<00:01:54.869> servers<00:01:55.200> first<00:01:55.409> of<00:01:55.500> all<00:01:55.560> the

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
because the PTR servers first of all the

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.450 
because the PTR servers first of all the
world<00:01:55.860> wide<00:01:56.040> so<00:01:56.340> they're<00:01:56.460> not<00:01:56.579> localized<00:01:57.060> and

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:58.460 
world wide so they're not localized and

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:00.649 
world wide so they're not localized and
you<00:01:59.460> basically<00:01:59.759> can't<00:02:00.149> get<00:02:00.299> into<00:02:00.450> the<00:02:00.540> game

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
you basically can't get into the game

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:03.620 
you basically can't get into the game
because<00:02:01.290> everybody<00:02:02.009> is<00:02:02.130> trying<00:02:02.399> to<00:02:02.790> just<00:02:03.149> get

because everybody is trying to just get
a<00:02:03.689> bunch<00:02:03.840> of<00:02:03.990> legendaries<00:02:04.500> and<00:02:04.710> have<00:02:04.829> some<00:02:05.070> fun

a bunch of legendaries and have some fun

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.380

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
because they're bored with the actual

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.160 
because they're bored with the actual
game<00:02:06.479> and<00:02:06.930> it's<00:02:07.799> cool<00:02:08.039> but<00:02:08.629> there<00:02:09.629> are<00:02:09.750> two

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.069 
alright so the first bad thing is no
proper<00:02:21.889> testing<00:02:22.310> I<00:02:22.519> get<00:02:23.299> the<00:02:23.389> concept<00:02:23.510> and<00:02:23.930> yes

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:24.079 
proper testing I get the concept and yes

00:02:24.079 --> 00:02:26.770 
proper testing I get the concept and yes
once<00:02:24.319> this<00:02:24.530> is<00:02:24.739> like<00:02:24.950> over<00:02:25.389> this<00:02:26.389> little<00:02:26.629> buff

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
once this is like over this little buff

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.149 
once this is like over this little buff
is<00:02:26.930> over<00:02:27.230> then<00:02:27.530> you<00:02:27.709> know<00:02:27.799> things<00:02:28.010> will

00:02:28.149 --> 00:02:28.159 
is over then you know things will

00:02:28.159 --> 00:02:30.759 
is over then you know things will
possibly<00:02:28.969> go<00:02:29.510> back<00:02:29.659> to<00:02:29.780> normal<00:02:29.930> i<00:02:30.200> get<00:02:30.680> that

00:02:30.759 --> 00:02:30.769 
possibly go back to normal i get that

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:32.170 
possibly go back to normal i get that
they<00:02:30.859> just<00:02:30.980> want<00:02:31.219> more<00:02:31.340> people<00:02:31.549> testing<00:02:32.090> on

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
they just want more people testing on

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.539 
they just want more people testing on
PTR<00:02:32.480> but<00:02:33.109> right<00:02:33.260> now<00:02:33.439> you<00:02:34.069> can't<00:02:34.340> actually

00:02:34.539 --> 00:02:34.549 
PTR but right now you can't actually

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:36.819 
PTR but right now you can't actually

who like the serious players which is a

00:02:48.109 --> 00:02:49.809 
who like the serious players which is a
very<00:02:48.349> small<00:02:48.650> percentage<00:02:49.159> of<00:02:49.310> the<00:02:49.400> community

00:02:49.809 --> 00:02:49.819 
very small percentage of the community

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:51.670 
very small percentage of the community
which<00:02:49.939> would<00:02:50.090> never<00:02:50.359> actually<00:02:50.780> load<00:02:51.319> up<00:02:51.500> the

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 
which would never actually load up the

which would never actually load up the
PTR<00:02:52.040> servers<00:02:52.370> doesn't<00:02:53.239> get<00:02:53.359> to<00:02:53.449> play<00:02:53.599> that's

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
PTR servers doesn't get to play that's

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:55.179 
PTR servers doesn't get to play that's
myself<00:02:54.260> included<00:02:54.620> i<00:02:54.680> haven't<00:02:54.919> been<00:02:54.980> able<00:02:55.040> to

00:02:55.179 --> 00:02:55.189 
myself included i haven't been able to

00:02:55.189 --> 00:02:57.640 
myself included i haven't been able to
in<00:02:55.280> the<00:02:55.370> PTR<00:02:55.699> so<00:02:56.000> i'm<00:02:56.599> not<00:02:56.750> really<00:02:57.019> like<00:02:57.260> i

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650 
in the PTR so i'm not really like i

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:59.080 
in the PTR so i'm not really like i
guess<00:02:58.129> i'm<00:02:58.310> in<00:02:58.400> a<00:02:58.459> way<00:02:58.549> complaining<00:02:58.969> that<00:02:59.000> I

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.090 
guess i'm in a way complaining that I

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:01.689 
guess i'm in a way complaining that I
can't<00:02:59.120> get<00:02:59.449> in<00:02:59.540> but<00:02:59.840> it's<00:03:00.099> it<00:03:01.099> goes<00:03:01.340> beyond

00:03:01.689 --> 00:03:01.699 
can't get in but it's it goes beyond

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:04.270 
can't get in but it's it goes beyond
that<00:03:01.909> so<00:03:02.599> first<00:03:03.049> of<00:03:03.199> all<00:03:03.290> we're<00:03:04.010> gonna<00:03:04.099> have<00:03:04.250> a

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280 
that so first of all we're gonna have a

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.369 
that so first of all we're gonna have a
patch<00:03:04.489> you<00:03:05.239> know<00:03:05.389> because<00:03:06.019> they're<00:03:06.169> not<00:03:06.290> going

00:03:06.369 --> 00:03:06.379 
patch you know because they're not going

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:07.449 
patch you know because they're not going
to<00:03:06.469> have<00:03:06.560> PTR<00:03:06.799> forever<00:03:07.099> going<00:03:07.250> to<00:03:07.340> have<00:03:07.430> a

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:07.459 
to have PTR forever going to have a

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:09.399 
to have PTR forever going to have a
patch<00:03:07.699> that<00:03:08.030> is<00:03:08.180> not<00:03:08.480> properly<00:03:08.989> tested

00:03:09.399 --> 00:03:09.409 
patch that is not properly tested

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:12.640 
patch that is not properly tested
because<00:03:10.099> the<00:03:10.489> players<00:03:10.790> who<00:03:11.209> actually<00:03:12.169> test

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.650 
because the players who actually test

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:14.979 
because the players who actually test
this<00:03:12.799> kind<00:03:13.040> of<00:03:13.099> stuff<00:03:13.340> can't<00:03:14.060> get<00:03:14.180> it<00:03:14.299> they

00:03:14.979 --> 00:03:14.989 
this kind of stuff can't get it they

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:16.929 
this kind of stuff can't get it they
can't<00:03:15.230> test<00:03:15.530> stuff<00:03:15.709> I<00:03:15.919> don't<00:03:16.430> I<00:03:16.549> personally

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:05.320 
something that is going to carry over I

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:08.430 
something that is going to carry over I
given<00:05:05.920> to<00:05:06.010> you<00:05:06.100> guys<00:05:06.280> that's<00:05:06.640> just<00:05:06.940> a<00:05:07.360> buff<00:05:07.690> and

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:08.440 
given to you guys that's just a buff and

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:10.080 
given to you guys that's just a buff and
I<00:05:08.530> don't<00:05:08.710> have<00:05:08.800> a<00:05:08.860> source<00:05:09.160> but<00:05:09.520> in<00:05:09.700> previous

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:10.090 
I don't have a source but in previous

I don't have a source but in previous
ptrs<00:05:10.540> a<00:05:10.870> blizzard<00:05:11.560> has<00:05:11.710> stated<00:05:12.100> that<00:05:12.340> they<00:05:12.550> do

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:12.610 
ptrs a blizzard has stated that they do

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:15.750 
ptrs a blizzard has stated that they do
increase<00:05:13.090> drop<00:05:13.390> rates<00:05:13.630> on<00:05:13.920> items<00:05:14.920> just<00:05:15.550> you

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:15.760 
increase drop rates on items just you

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:16.920 
increase drop rates on items just you
know<00:05:15.790> for<00:05:16.000> testing<00:05:16.270> purposes<00:05:16.630> so<00:05:16.780> ancient

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:16.930 
know for testing purposes so ancient

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:18.600 
know for testing purposes so ancient
items<00:05:17.320> won't<00:05:17.470> actually<00:05:17.590> drop<00:05:17.980> that<00:05:18.130> often<00:05:18.460> but

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:18.610 
items won't actually drop that often but

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:21.510 
items won't actually drop that often but
the<00:05:18.790> the<00:05:19.120> implication<00:05:19.750> is<00:05:19.930> that<00:05:20.530> now<00:05:21.310> you<00:05:21.370> get

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:21.520 
the the implication is that now you get

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:22.800 
the the implication is that now you get
all<00:05:21.610> these<00:05:21.700> players<00:05:21.970> who<00:05:22.420> are<00:05:22.510> just<00:05:22.600> regular

all these players who are just regular

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:25.470 
all these players who are just regular

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:25.480 
players or loading up the PTR servers

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:26.520 
players or loading up the PTR servers
are<00:05:25.600> coming<00:05:25.810> in<00:05:25.900> here<00:05:26.110> they're<00:05:26.260> seeing<00:05:26.410> all

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:26.530 
are coming in here they're seeing all

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:28.260 
are coming in here they're seeing all
this<00:05:26.620> cool<00:05:26.800> stuff<00:05:26.860> getting<00:05:27.610> ancient<00:05:28.030> items
