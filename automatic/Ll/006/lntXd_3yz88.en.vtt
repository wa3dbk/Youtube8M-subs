00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
horse for a month or so and I said bill

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:53.270 
horse for a month or so and I said bill
is<00:00:46.440> foolish<00:00:46.860> and<00:00:48.890> he'd<00:00:49.890> like<00:00:50.690> started<00:00:52.070> to<00:00:53.070> go

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
is foolish and he'd like started to go

then<00:00:57.270> he<00:00:57.420> did<00:00:57.629> become<00:00:58.079> obsessed<00:00:58.649> with<00:01:00.140> trying

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
then he did become obsessed with trying

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.670 
then he did become obsessed with trying
to<00:01:01.230> get<00:01:01.379> this<00:01:01.559> horse<00:01:01.800> to<00:01:01.949> the<00:01:02.250> Hamiltonian

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:46.610 
Tommy Hartman was the youngest driver to

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:48.819 
Tommy Hartman was the youngest driver to
win<00:01:46.790> a<00:01:46.820> Hamiltonian<00:01:47.570> Heath<00:01:47.810> and<00:01:48.320> after<00:01:48.649> his

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:48.829 
win a Hamiltonian Heath and after his

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:51.160 
win a Hamiltonian Heath and after his
success<00:01:49.280> in<00:01:49.490> that<00:01:49.670> first<00:01:49.909> elimination<00:01:50.570> it<00:01:50.990> was

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:51.170 
success in that first elimination it was

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:53.020 
success in that first elimination it was
time<00:01:51.409> for<00:01:51.439> Burgermeister<00:01:52.399> and<00:01:52.580> Bill<00:01:52.759> Horton

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.030 
time for Burgermeister and Bill Horton

00:01:53.030 --> 00:02:11.410 
time for Burgermeister and Bill Horton
to<00:01:53.330> race

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.410 

so<00:02:12.020> the<00:02:12.170> stage<00:02:12.440> was<00:02:12.710> set<00:02:12.740> the<00:02:13.580> next<00:02:13.940> race<00:02:14.150> would

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
so the stage was set the next race would

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:29.370 
so the stage was set the next race would
determine<00:02:14.780> the<00:02:14.960> winner<00:02:15.260> of<00:02:15.380> this<00:02:15.680> Amazonian

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:32.570 
Tommy one the first teeth with final

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:34.360 
Tommy one the first teeth with final
score<00:02:32.810> then<00:02:33.080> Burgermeister<00:02:33.860> 1<00:02:34.040> the<00:02:34.190> next

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
score then Burgermeister 1 the next

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:38.080 
score then Burgermeister 1 the next
elimination<00:02:34.820> and<00:02:35.420> then<00:02:36.700> final<00:02:37.700> score<00:02:37.880> made<00:02:38.060> a

elimination and then final score made a

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:41.320 
elimination and then final score made a
break<00:02:38.390> at<00:02:38.570> 3/4<00:02:39.230> pole<00:02:39.670> for<00:02:40.670> really<00:02:40.970> no<00:02:41.120> reason

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:41.330 
break at 3/4 pole for really no reason

00:02:41.330 --> 00:03:22.020

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:23.940 

I<00:03:22.060> was<00:03:22.600> there<00:03:22.720> taking<00:03:22.900> pictures<00:03:23.380> at<00:03:23.530> the<00:03:23.680> point

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:23.950 
I was there taking pictures at the point

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:26.430 
I was there taking pictures at the point
and<00:03:24.250> it's<00:03:25.210> pretty<00:03:25.450> tough<00:03:25.660> to<00:03:25.720> take<00:03:25.900> pictures

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:26.440 
and it's pretty tough to take pictures

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:29.250 
and it's pretty tough to take pictures
when<00:03:26.620> your<00:03:26.800> eyes<00:03:26.950> are<00:03:27.180> teary<00:03:28.180> over<00:03:28.540> I<00:03:28.780> cried

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260 
when your eyes are teary over I cried

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.940 
when your eyes are teary over I cried
and<00:03:29.830> most<00:03:30.250> other<00:03:30.460> people<00:03:30.850> dead<00:03:31.030> Derek<00:03:31.300> Tony

hard

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:47.150 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:49.179 

I<00:03:47.239> said<00:03:47.930> I<00:03:47.959> wasn't<00:03:48.290> even<00:03:48.620> driving<00:03:48.799> the<00:03:49.040> horse

00:03:49.179 --> 00:03:49.189 
I said I wasn't even driving the horse
