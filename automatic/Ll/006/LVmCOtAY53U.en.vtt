00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
start off with the first car so the

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.029 
start off with the first car so the
first<00:00:54.210> image<00:00:54.539> being<00:00:54.750> displayed<00:00:54.840> features<00:00:55.829> the

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
first image being displayed features the

first image being displayed features the
Turismo<00:00:56.640> R<00:00:56.850> but<00:00:57.420> as<00:00:57.539> you<00:00:57.690> can<00:00:57.780> see<00:00:57.960> it<00:00:58.050> has<00:00:58.199> a

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
Turismo R but as you can see it has a

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.709 
Turismo R but as you can see it has a
roof<00:00:58.710> from<00:00:59.190> the<00:00:59.250> Alberti<00:00:59.760> buccaneer<00:01:00.239> fitted

roof from the Alberti buccaneer fitted

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.569 
roof from the Alberti buccaneer fitted
now<00:01:01.289> for<00:01:01.530> obvious<00:01:01.590> reasons<00:01:02.219> the<00:01:02.399> merge

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
now for obvious reasons the merge

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.000 
now for obvious reasons the merge
between<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:03.059> roof<00:01:03.270> and<00:01:03.300> the<00:01:03.570> Turismo<00:01:04.379> R<00:01:04.409> isn't

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
between the roof and the Turismo R isn't

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.219 
between the roof and the Turismo R isn't
perfect<00:01:05.549> for<00:01:06.119> example<00:01:06.570> as<00:01:06.720> you<00:01:06.750> can<00:01:06.900> see<00:01:07.110> the

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
perfect for example as you can see the

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:08.539 
perfect for example as you can see the
glass<00:01:07.439> on<00:01:07.619> the<00:01:07.650> back<00:01:07.860> doesn't<00:01:08.130> line<00:01:08.369> up

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
glass on the back doesn't line up

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.520 
glass on the back doesn't line up
correctly<00:01:08.729> but<00:01:09.600> even<00:01:09.810> so<00:01:09.990> I'm<00:01:10.080> sure<00:01:10.260> you<00:01:10.350> guys

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530

nice car I guess you could say it's a

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:19.649 
nice car I guess you could say it's a
bit<00:02:18.040> like<00:02:18.189> Marmite<00:02:18.640> where<00:02:19.150> some<00:02:19.390> of<00:02:19.450> you<00:02:19.540> may

00:02:19.649 --> 00:02:19.659 
bit like Marmite where some of you may

00:02:19.659 --> 00:02:22.050 
bit like Marmite where some of you may
like<00:02:19.900> it<00:02:19.930> but<00:02:20.560> others<00:02:20.799> of<00:02:20.890> you<00:02:21.099> may<00:02:21.400> hate<00:02:21.640> it

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
like it but others of you may hate it

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.149 
like it but others of you may hate it
basically<00:02:22.659> it's<00:02:22.840> a<00:02:22.930> lifted<00:02:23.290> adder<00:02:23.439> which<00:02:23.950> has

basically it's a lifted adder which has
an<00:02:24.310> off-road<00:02:24.670> kit<00:02:24.909> on<00:02:25.060> it<00:02:25.090> with<00:02:25.629> off-road

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:26.109 
an off-road kit on it with off-road

usually<00:02:29.319> not<00:02:29.470> many<00:02:29.620> people<00:02:29.829> think<00:02:30.099> about

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
usually not many people think about

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.220 
usually not many people think about
lifting<00:02:30.489> supercars<00:02:31.239> but<00:02:31.480> in<00:02:31.689> this<00:02:31.810> case<00:02:32.049> I

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
lifting supercars but in this case I

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:33.899 
lifting supercars but in this case I

00:02:33.899 --> 00:02:33.909 
think it suits this car and it looks

00:02:33.909 --> 00:02:36.000 
think it suits this car and it looks
quite<00:02:34.090> cool<00:02:34.390> moving<00:02:35.109> on<00:02:35.200> to<00:02:35.290> the<00:02:35.379> next<00:02:35.530> vehicle

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010
