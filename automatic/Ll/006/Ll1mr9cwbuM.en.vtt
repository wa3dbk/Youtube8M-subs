the jump as you can see the jump that's

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.080 
the jump as you can see the jump that's
the<00:01:08.189> jump<00:01:08.460> that<00:01:08.490> I<00:01:08.610> was<00:01:08.760> talking<00:01:08.970> about

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
the jump that I was talking about

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.969 
the jump that I was talking about
earlier<00:01:09.299> the<00:01:09.630> double<00:01:09.930> jump<00:01:10.080> as<00:01:10.530> you<00:01:10.619> can<00:01:10.830> see

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
earlier the double jump as you can see

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.210 
earlier the double jump as you can see
it's<00:01:11.100> not<00:01:11.250> really<00:01:11.640> as<00:01:11.790> like<00:01:12.409> high<00:01:13.409> as<00:01:13.740> it<00:01:13.950> is<00:01:13.979> in

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
it's not really as like high as it is in

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.980 
it's not really as like high as it is in
advanced<00:01:14.610> warfare<00:01:14.760> it's<00:01:15.090> more<00:01:15.270> like<00:01:15.450> Fortune

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
advanced warfare it's more like Fortune

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:21.109 
advanced warfare it's more like Fortune
Versalles<00:01:16.409> so<00:01:16.950> it<00:01:17.040> was<00:01:17.220> kind<00:01:17.400> of<00:01:17.490> like<00:01:20.060> how<00:01:21.060> to

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
Versalles so it was kind of like how to

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.300 
Versalles so it was kind of like how to
use<00:01:21.299> that<00:01:21.509> gun<00:01:21.960> fights<00:01:22.259> which<00:01:22.500> I'm<00:01:23.009> feel<00:01:23.280> like

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
use that gun fights which I'm feel like

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:24.830 
use that gun fights which I'm feel like
I'm<00:01:23.880> getting<00:01:24.180> to<00:01:24.240> feel<00:01:24.390> that<00:01:24.540> it's<00:01:24.630> more

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
I'm getting to feel that it's more

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.840 
I'm getting to feel that it's more
mainly<00:01:25.350> for<00:01:25.590> traversal<00:01:26.070> I'm<00:01:26.159> not<00:01:26.369> really<00:01:26.610> for

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
mainly for traversal I'm not really for

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.550 
mainly for traversal I'm not really for
like<00:01:27.060> gunfire<00:01:27.659> I<00:01:27.869> feel<00:01:28.020> like<00:01:28.110> it'd<00:01:28.259> be<00:01:28.350> an<00:01:28.439> easy

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
like gunfire I feel like it'd be an easy

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.890 
like gunfire I feel like it'd be an easy

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
ability and for this character I think

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.920 
ability and for this character I think
it's<00:01:40.920> yeah<00:01:41.430> it's<00:01:41.850> barrows<00:01:42.180> this<00:01:42.420> boat<00:01:42.600> bow<00:01:42.780> and

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
it's yeah it's barrows this boat bow and

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.230 
it's yeah it's barrows this boat bow and
arrow<00:01:43.049> so<00:01:43.409> there's<00:01:44.399> much<00:01:44.549> decent<00:01:44.880> gainful

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
arrow so there's much decent gainful

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.870 
arrow so there's much decent gainful
with<00:01:45.329> that<00:01:45.479> to<00:01:45.920> the<00:01:46.920> boner<00:01:47.220> is<00:01:47.369> absolutely

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
with that to the boner is absolutely

faster so it can feel like an auto rifle
but<00:03:31.430> technically<00:03:32.000> you're<00:03:32.269> still<00:03:32.510> like

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:35.090 
curious how many keep pulling the

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:36.280 
curious how many keep pulling the
trigger<00:03:35.300> every<00:03:35.540> single<00:03:35.750> time<00:03:35.930> but<00:03:36.110> it's<00:03:36.260> just

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:36.290 
trigger every single time but it's just

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:37.870 
trigger every single time but it's just

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:02.610 
I'm just hoping it does turn out to be
good<00:04:00.519> because<00:04:00.720> ghosts<00:04:01.720> you<00:04:01.959> know<00:04:02.019> everyone

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:02.620 
good because ghosts you know everyone

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:04.170 
good because ghosts you know everyone
knows<00:04:02.739> how<00:04:02.950> ghost<00:04:03.220> wasn't<00:04:03.430> exactly<00:04:03.790> and

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:04.180 
knows how ghost wasn't exactly and

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:05.520 
knows how ghost wasn't exactly and
there's<00:04:04.300> been<00:04:04.450> a<00:04:04.480> lot<00:04:04.629> of<00:04:04.750> flack<00:04:04.989> on<00:04:05.200> advanced

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:05.530 
there's been a lot of flack on advanced

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:07.979 
there's been a lot of flack on advanced
warfare<00:04:05.950> recently<00:04:06.340> as<00:04:06.430> well<00:04:06.700> but<00:04:07.540> that's<00:04:07.750> not

00:04:07.979 --> 00:04:07.989 
warfare recently as well but that's not

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:10.680 
warfare recently as well but that's not
a<00:04:08.019> surprise<00:04:08.379> because<00:04:09.060> around<00:04:10.060> this<00:04:10.209> time<00:04:10.480> the

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:10.690 
a surprise because around this time the

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:12.330 
a surprise because around this time the
last<00:04:10.870> colony<00:04:11.319> usually<00:04:11.620> gets<00:04:11.799> a<00:04:11.890> lot<00:04:12.040> of<00:04:12.069> shape

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:12.340 
last colony usually gets a lot of shape

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:14.190 
last colony usually gets a lot of shape
but<00:04:12.519> my<00:04:13.000> final<00:04:13.299> opinion<00:04:13.510> I'll<00:04:13.870> probably<00:04:14.049> make

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:14.200 
but my final opinion I'll probably make

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:16.650 
but my final opinion I'll probably make
a<00:04:14.260> video<00:04:14.470> separate<00:04:15.069> on<00:04:15.190> that<00:04:15.519> my<00:04:16.060> final<00:04:16.449> thing

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:16.660 
a video separate on that my final thing

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:18.689 
a video separate on that my final thing
is<00:04:16.780> our<00:04:16.900> advanced<00:04:17.169> warfare<00:04:17.590> are<00:04:17.799> that<00:04:18.250> it<00:04:18.459> spy
