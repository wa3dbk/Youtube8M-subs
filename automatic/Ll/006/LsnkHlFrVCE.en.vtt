00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.280
 the defect is a 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:17.920
 lg 42 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:20.470
 plasma TV the red star lights up 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:22.300
 also jumps from turning on, however 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:24.490
 plenty of voltage from the power supply 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:27.900
 will not deliver otherwise in the dictionary 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:27.900
 To build a picture 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:37.100
 the power supplies platinum 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:42.100
 are you eight as in this device 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:42.100
 Write around to remove the platinum 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.079
 even 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:48.420
 Edition power supply board lead this 

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:51.820
 are secured with a click system 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:54.539
 by contrast, to the plug 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:54.539
 withdraw 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.790
 on the removed board is very 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.820
 beautiful 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:29.380
 whether the parents recognize this next to the 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:32.620
 Condenser you can find the platinum 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.790
 designation you will find this designation 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:38.500
 also on the back 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:39.790
 next to the solder joint of the capacitor i 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.350
 now become this capacitor 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:44.140
 to explore by way of example 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:46.450
 To explore, I use a heated 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:47.950
 in the blood suction pump what the handling around 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:50.500
 some simplifies because you only one 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:52.510
 Device in hand is holding around the pump 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:54.580
 optimal to attach to the solder joint 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:57.759
 I go along the beagle direction 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:02:00.220
 it just zero point on which to so 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:02.950
 This optimally with the Loeb tip 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:04.840
 contact has as soon as the user 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:07.900
 liquefied presses the trigger 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:09.330
 on the end user pump for the pilot 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:12.190
 suck 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:14.230
 as soon as the pilots have been canceled there goes 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:16.510
 one with two fingers on the condenser 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:18.670
 you choose the solder joint again heated 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:21.330
 This allows the capacitor 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:21.330
 easier to remove 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:28.920
 Here you can see very well that the 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.330
 capacitor is dissolved upwards 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.630
 this has the consequence that the 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:35.610
 capacitors loses capacity and dsr 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:38.820
 what is negative on the whole 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:40.770
 Creation becomes the four lower 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:41.490
 defective capacitors are now 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:43.950
 explored 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:46.620
 You can go to the black bars here 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:49.110
 recognize where the negative pole of 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:51.390
 Capacitors located around 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:54.270
 ensure that there are no errors 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:55.770
 is made at the shorter foot of the 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:58.140
 Condenser on the golden 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:59.790
 In this case , you can strip on 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:02.160
 condenser recognize where the - 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.720
 is found in the bridge 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.850
 establishment exactly back to it 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:09.080
 pay attention that the golden stripes on the 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:09.080
 black beams on loves 

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:14.270
 After checking the 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:16.550
 capacitors have plugged in whether this 

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:18.140
 are also correctly reversed in this 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:19.970
 case is the rear capacitor 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:22.390
 installed differently than the three 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:22.390
 front 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:29.900
 to initiate the capacitors 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:31.640
 Now the board turned now turn the 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:33.170
 feet of the capacitors around 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:35.269
 ensure that the capacitors 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:37.760
 Do not be recharged 

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:38.750
 fall out of a clean solder joint 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:40.730
 to obtain 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:43.159
 Now go with the loeb tip to the 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:44.690
 appropriate point and ask her 

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:46.879
 sure you with the world's top the 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:49.569
 touch wire as well as the solder joint 

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:51.980
 only about two seconds, they add new ones 

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:53.870
 and then pull the soldering iron 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:56.510
 along the tree starting at one 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:57.890
 to get the optimal solder joint is one 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:02.290
 Condensers successfully installed 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:02.290
 snap it off any excess remaining feet
