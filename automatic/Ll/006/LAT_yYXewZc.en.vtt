00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.320 
it down into a nice even finish and the
offset<00:02:14.110> spatula<00:02:14.560> is<00:02:14.680> just<00:02:14.950> that<00:02:15.130> yanking<00:02:16.000> a

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
offset spatula is just that yanking a

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.060 
offset spatula is just that yanking a
little<00:02:16.570> crank<00:02:16.720> handle<00:02:16.870> it<00:02:17.080> just<00:02:17.230> means<00:02:17.440> your

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:18.070 
little crank handle it just means your

hands<00:02:18.280> not<00:02:18.580> likely<00:02:18.790> to<00:02:18.940> touch<00:02:19.180> the

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
hands not likely to touch the

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.660 
hands not likely to touch the
buttercream<00:02:19.900> it<00:02:20.140> just<00:02:20.320> makes<00:02:20.800> it<00:02:20.920> easier<00:02:21.340> so

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
buttercream it just makes it easier so

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:23.070 
buttercream it just makes it easier so
once<00:02:21.820> the<00:02:21.910> cake<00:02:22.060> is<00:02:22.090> kind<00:02:22.360> of<00:02:22.510> nicely<00:02:22.900> covered

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
once the cake is kind of nicely covered

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:24.660 
once the cake is kind of nicely covered
we're<00:02:23.350> gonna<00:02:23.470> give<00:02:23.650> it<00:02:23.680> the<00:02:23.770> swirl<00:02:24.070> decoration

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
we're gonna give it the swirl decoration

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:26.220 
we're gonna give it the swirl decoration
