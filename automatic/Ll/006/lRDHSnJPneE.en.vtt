be talking about the innovations of the

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.230 
be talking about the innovations of the
arm<00:00:22.189> muscle<00:00:23.189> so<00:00:23.460> we're<00:00:23.609> talking<00:00:23.939> about<00:00:24.060> the

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
arm muscle so we're talking about the

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.019 
arm muscle so we're talking about the
muscles<00:00:24.689> in<00:00:24.840> the<00:00:25.170> arm<00:00:25.470> let's<00:00:26.369> get<00:00:26.640> right<00:00:26.849> into

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
muscles in the arm let's get right into

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:27.439 
muscles in the arm let's get right into
it

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
it

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.720 
it
when<00:00:27.990> it<00:00:28.080> comes<00:00:28.289> to<00:00:28.529> the<00:00:28.710> innovations<00:00:29.460> of<00:00:29.609> the

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
when it comes to the innovations of the

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.179 
when it comes to the innovations of the
muscles<00:00:30.119> in<00:00:30.240> the<00:00:30.269> arm<00:00:30.570> there<00:00:31.470> are<00:00:31.560> only<00:00:31.800> two

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
muscles in the arm there are only two

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.010 
muscles in the arm there are only two
nerves<00:00:32.489> that<00:00:32.759> we<00:00:32.910> need<00:00:33.059> to<00:00:33.149> be<00:00:33.270> concerned<00:00:33.870> with

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
nerves that we need to be concerned with

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.510 
nerves that we need to be concerned with
remember<00:00:34.739> I'm<00:00:34.800> not<00:00:34.920> dealing<00:00:35.280> with<00:00:35.309> the

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
remember I'm not dealing with the

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.060 
remember I'm not dealing with the
forearm<00:00:36.030> just<00:00:36.329> the<00:00:36.719> arm<00:00:36.930> and<00:00:37.230> those<00:00:37.710> two

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
forearm just the arm and those two

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.510 
forearm just the arm and those two
nerves<00:00:38.430> are<00:00:38.730> the<00:00:39.030> musculocutaneous<00:00:39.840> nerve

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:40.520 
nerves are the musculocutaneous nerve

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:44.209 
nerves are the musculocutaneous nerve
and<00:00:41.520> you<00:00:41.579> can<00:00:42.180> see<00:00:42.450> that<00:00:42.719> here<00:00:42.989> this<00:00:43.200> is<00:00:43.410> the<00:00:43.590> it

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
and you can see that here this is the it

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.729 
and you can see that here this is the it
comes<00:00:44.579> from<00:00:44.700> the<00:00:44.850> lateral<00:00:45.390> branch<00:00:45.840> of<00:00:46.200> the

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
comes from the lateral branch of the

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.330 
comes from the lateral branch of the
lateral<00:00:47.370> cord<00:00:47.879> the<00:00:48.600> musculocutaneous<00:00:49.200> nerve

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:49.340 
lateral cord the musculocutaneous nerve

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:54.080 
lateral cord the musculocutaneous nerve
and<00:00:50.899> the<00:00:51.899> radial<00:00:51.930> nerve<00:00:52.800> and<00:00:53.160> you<00:00:53.219> can<00:00:53.460> see<00:00:53.730> the

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
and the radial nerve and you can see the

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:59.000 
and the radial nerve and you can see the
radial<00:00:54.840> nerve<00:00:55.230> right<00:00:55.920> here<00:00:57.710> that<00:00:58.710> is<00:00:58.859> the

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
radial nerve right here that is the

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.630 
radial nerve right here that is the
medial<00:00:59.609> branch<00:00:59.910> of<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.989> posterior<00:01:01.680> cord<00:01:02.219> so

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
medial branch of the posterior cord so

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.429 
medial branch of the posterior cord so
those<00:01:02.820> are<00:01:02.969> the<00:01:03.030> two<00:01:03.239> nerves<00:01:03.539> that<00:01:03.870> we<00:01:04.140> are

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
those are the two nerves that we are

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.969 
those are the two nerves that we are
concerned<00:01:04.949> with<00:01:05.129> with<00:01:06.119> the<00:01:06.360> arm<00:01:06.570> muscles

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:06.979 
concerned with with the arm muscles

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:09.109 
concerned with with the arm muscles
they're<00:01:07.979> going<00:01:08.100> to<00:01:08.159> innervate<00:01:08.670> all<00:01:08.880> the

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
they're going to innervate all the

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.050 
they're going to innervate all the
muscles<00:01:09.540> in<00:01:09.780> the<00:01:09.810> arm<00:01:10.170> so<00:01:10.500> let's<00:01:11.040> look<00:01:11.640> at<00:01:11.790> the

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
muscles in the arm so let's look at the

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.000 
muscles in the arm so let's look at the
muscles<00:01:12.510> in<00:01:12.689> the<00:01:12.720> arm<00:01:13.080> now<00:01:13.500> I<00:01:13.530> don't<00:01:13.740> know<00:01:13.950> if

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
muscles in the arm now I don't know if

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.460 
muscles in the arm now I don't know if
you<00:01:14.100> ever<00:01:14.369> noticed<00:01:14.820> before<00:01:14.970> but<00:01:15.259> when<00:01:16.259> you<00:01:16.350> go

muscles of the arm and those are

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.670 
muscles of the arm and those are
innervated<00:01:49.710> by<00:01:50.070> the<00:01:50.250> musculocutaneous<00:01:51.119> nerve

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:51.680 
innervated by the musculocutaneous nerve

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.410 
innervated by the musculocutaneous nerve
and<00:01:52.680> you<00:01:53.130> know<00:01:53.310> that's<00:01:53.880> the<00:01:54.000> way<00:01:54.090> I<00:01:54.119> want<00:01:54.329> you

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
and you know that's the way I want you

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.499 
and you know that's the way I want you
to<00:01:54.570> remember<00:01:54.750> it<00:01:54.960> musculoskeletal<00:01:56.270> guys<00:01:57.270> in

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
to remember it musculoskeletal guys in

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.359 
to remember it musculoskeletal guys in
the<00:01:57.600> gym<00:01:57.869> thinking<00:01:58.530> they're<00:01:58.649> very<00:01:58.920> muscular

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
the gym thinking they're very muscular

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.819 
the gym thinking they're very muscular
looking<00:01:59.820> in<00:01:59.909> the<00:02:00.000> mirror<00:02:00.240> flexing<00:02:01.200> their<00:02:01.380> arms

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
looking in the mirror flexing their arms

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.920 
looking in the mirror flexing their arms
those<00:02:02.640> are<00:02:03.030> innervated<00:02:03.509> by<00:02:03.780> the

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
those are innervated by the

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.609 
those are innervated by the
musculocutaneous<00:02:04.920> nerve<00:02:06.079> so<00:02:07.079> those<00:02:07.320> muscles

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
musculocutaneous nerve so those muscles

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.410 
musculocutaneous nerve so those muscles
would<00:02:08.009> be<00:02:08.190> what<00:02:08.429> are<00:02:08.520> the<00:02:08.580> flexor<00:02:08.970> muscles<00:02:09.300> in

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
would be what are the flexor muscles in

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.020 
would be what are the flexor muscles in
the<00:02:09.479> arm<00:02:09.720> we<00:02:09.959> have<00:02:09.989> of<00:02:10.410> course<00:02:10.470> the<00:02:11.190> bicep

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
the arm we have of course the bicep

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.450 
the arm we have of course the bicep
the<00:02:12.450> biceps<00:02:12.930> brachii<00:02:13.260> these<00:02:13.980> are<00:02:14.160> the<00:02:14.250> ones

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:14.460 
the biceps brachii these are the ones

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:16.880 
the biceps brachii these are the ones
that<00:02:14.550> we<00:02:14.730> talk<00:02:14.970> about<00:02:15.120> a<00:02:15.240> lot<00:02:15.480> and<00:02:15.710> then<00:02:16.710> we

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
that we talk about a lot and then we

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.460 
that we talk about a lot and then we
have<00:02:17.100> the<00:02:17.400> brachialis<00:02:18.000> that's<00:02:18.960> going<00:02:19.230> to<00:02:19.290> be

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
have the brachialis that's going to be

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.650 
have the brachialis that's going to be
right<00:02:20.010> beneath<00:02:20.430> the<00:02:20.610> brup<00:02:20.850> the<00:02:21.120> biceps

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
right beneath the brup the biceps

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.770 
right beneath the brup the biceps
brachii<00:02:21.960> and<00:02:22.440> then<00:02:23.250> we<00:02:23.400> have

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
brachii and then we have

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:26.720 
brachii and then we have
coracobrachialis<00:02:25.670> okay<00:02:26.670> so

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
coracobrachialis okay so

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:31.070 
coracobrachialis okay so
coracobrachialis<00:02:28.190> biceps<00:02:29.190> brachii<00:02:29.460> and<00:02:30.080> the

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
coracobrachialis biceps brachii and the

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.550 
coracobrachialis biceps brachii and the
brachialis<00:02:31.530> muscles<00:02:32.250> those<00:02:32.850> are<00:02:33.150> all

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
brachialis muscles those are all

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.640 
brachialis muscles those are all
innovated<00:02:34.560> by<00:02:34.590> that<00:02:35.040> musculocutaneous<00:02:35.910> nerve

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
innovated by that musculocutaneous nerve

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.130 
innovated by that musculocutaneous nerve
which<00:02:37.650> is<00:02:37.830> the<00:02:37.860> lateral<00:02:38.430> branch<00:02:39.000> coming<00:02:39.930> from

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
which is the lateral branch coming from

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:44.120 
which is the lateral branch coming from
the<00:02:40.350> lateral<00:02:41.070> cord<00:02:42.170> so<00:02:43.170> that's<00:02:43.380> on<00:02:43.560> one<00:02:43.770> end

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
the lateral cord so that's on one end

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:47.030 
the lateral cord so that's on one end
and<00:02:44.370> then<00:02:44.580> of<00:02:44.760> course<00:02:45.410> when<00:02:46.410> I<00:02:46.440> used<00:02:46.709> to<00:02:46.860> work

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
and then of course when I used to work

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.560 
and then of course when I used to work
out<00:02:47.220> I<00:02:47.459> used<00:02:47.700> to<00:02:47.790> work<00:02:47.940> out<00:02:48.090> with<00:02:48.209> a<00:02:48.240> partner

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570 
out I used to work out with a partner

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:50.420 
out I used to work out with a partner
that<00:02:48.930> you<00:02:49.140> should<00:02:49.380> keep<00:02:49.800> telling<00:02:50.160> me<00:02:50.220> if<00:02:50.340> you

that you should keep telling me if you
want<00:02:50.640> your<00:02:50.790> arms<00:02:51.150> to<00:02:51.270> look<00:02:51.450> big

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
want your arms to look big

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.340 
want your arms to look big
yes<00:02:52.680> biceps<00:02:53.340> are<00:02:53.520> great<00:02:53.760> but<00:02:54.300> really<00:02:54.870> you<00:02:55.050> want

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
yes biceps are great but really you want

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:57.500 
yes biceps are great but really you want
if<00:02:55.530> you<00:02:55.680> want<00:02:55.890> them<00:02:56.070> to<00:02:56.100> look<00:02:56.310> really<00:02:57.150> great

if you want them to look really great
you<00:02:58.320> want<00:02:58.980> to<00:02:59.130> work<00:02:59.459> on<00:02:59.670> your<00:02:59.790> triceps<00:03:00.209> alright

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
you want to work on your triceps alright

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.980 
you want to work on your triceps alright
so<00:03:01.050> that's<00:03:01.290> these<00:03:02.209> extensor<00:03:03.209> muscles<00:03:03.720> the

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:03.990 
so that's these extensor muscles the

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:07.070 
so that's these extensor muscles the
triceps<00:03:04.650> right<00:03:05.060> so<00:03:06.060> if<00:03:06.150> you<00:03:06.240> want<00:03:06.420> your<00:03:06.750> arm

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
if you want your arms look really

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:14.660 
if you want your arms look really
radical<00:03:10.950> or<00:03:11.900> radio<00:03:12.900> I<00:03:13.430> don't<00:03:14.430> know<00:03:14.490> if<00:03:14.550> that

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
radical or radio I don't know if that

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:16.340 
radical or radio I don't know if that
works<00:03:14.910> but<00:03:15.180> if<00:03:15.450> you<00:03:15.720> wanted<00:03:16.080> to<00:03:16.140> look<00:03:16.290> really

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350 
works but if you wanted to look really

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:19.190 
works but if you wanted to look really
awesome<00:03:17.250> really<00:03:17.880> radial<00:03:18.360> you<00:03:18.480> got<00:03:18.720> to<00:03:18.870> work<00:03:18.989> on

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
awesome really radial you got to work on

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.810 
awesome really radial you got to work on
those<00:03:19.350> triceps<00:03:19.769> so<00:03:20.519> the<00:03:21.209> radial<00:03:21.840> nerve<00:03:22.820> that's

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:23.820 
those triceps so the radial nerve that's

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:26.120 
those triceps so the radial nerve that's
going<00:03:24.060> to<00:03:24.120> innervate<00:03:24.660> the<00:03:24.690> triceps<00:03:25.650> muscles

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 
going to innervate the triceps muscles

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:28.580 
going to innervate the triceps muscles
and<00:03:26.370> you<00:03:26.850> can<00:03:27.000> see<00:03:27.209> those<00:03:27.450> here<00:03:27.840> here<00:03:28.260> we<00:03:28.410> have

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
and you can see those here here we have

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:31.340 
and you can see those here here we have
the<00:03:28.739> triceps<00:03:29.280> the<00:03:29.370> lateral<00:03:29.910> head<00:03:30.150> the<00:03:30.959> and<00:03:31.170> the

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:31.350 
the triceps the lateral head the and the

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:32.870 
the triceps the lateral head the and the
long<00:03:31.590> head<00:03:31.950> of<00:03:32.130> course<00:03:32.340> you're<00:03:32.519> not<00:03:32.610> seeing

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 
long head of course you're not seeing

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.900 
long head of course you're not seeing
the<00:03:32.970> medial<00:03:33.360> head<00:03:33.540> but<00:03:34.290> that<00:03:34.650> those<00:03:35.400> that<00:03:35.850> the

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
the medial head but that those that the

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:39.590 
the medial head but that those that the
triceps<00:03:36.660> are<00:03:36.870> innervated<00:03:37.440> by<00:03:37.830> this<00:03:38.600> radial

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:39.600 
triceps are innervated by this radial

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:43.430 
triceps are innervated by this radial
nerve<00:03:40.200> which<00:03:40.769> is<00:03:40.950> the<00:03:41.250> medial<00:03:41.820> branch<00:03:42.150> of<00:03:42.660> the

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 
nerve which is the medial branch of the

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:48.289 
nerve which is the medial branch of the
posterior<00:03:44.190> cord<00:03:45.170> so<00:03:46.170> in<00:03:46.519> review<00:03:47.549> it's<00:03:47.850> a<00:03:48.060> very

00:03:48.289 --> 00:03:48.299 
posterior cord so in review it's a very

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:50.120 
posterior cord so in review it's a very
short<00:03:48.600> one<00:03:48.780> there's<00:03:49.049> not<00:03:49.200> much<00:03:49.470> to<00:03:49.650> learn<00:03:49.830> here

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:50.130 
short one there's not much to learn here

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:52.850 
short one there's not much to learn here
when<00:03:50.820> it<00:03:50.940> comes<00:03:51.150> to<00:03:51.330> the<00:03:51.450> flexor<00:03:52.019> muscles<00:03:52.620> the

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:52.860 
when it comes to the flexor muscles the

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:56.240 
when it comes to the flexor muscles the
coracobrachialis<00:03:53.930> biceps<00:03:54.930> brachii<00:03:55.170> and<00:03:55.650> the

coracobrachialis biceps brachii and the
brachialis<00:03:56.670> muscles<00:03:57.390> those<00:03:57.959> are<00:03:58.320> innervated

00:03:58.759 --> 00:03:58.769 
brachialis muscles those are innervated

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:03.350 
brachialis muscles those are innervated
by<00:03:59.160> the<00:03:59.480> musculocutaneous<00:04:00.480> nerve<00:04:01.250> and<00:04:02.360> then

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:03.360 
by the musculocutaneous nerve and then

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:06.800 
by the musculocutaneous nerve and then
the<00:04:03.690> triceps<00:04:04.440> the<00:04:05.340> triceps<00:04:05.970> brachii<00:04:06.239> are

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
the triceps the triceps brachii are

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:11.449 
the triceps the triceps brachii are
innervated<00:04:07.350> by<00:04:07.769> the<00:04:08.640> radial<00:04:09.620> nerve<00:04:10.620> that's

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:11.459 
innervated by the radial nerve that's

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:13.460 
innervated by the radial nerve that's
pretty<00:04:11.670> much<00:04:11.820> it<00:04:12.000> for<00:04:12.030> this<00:04:12.239> video<00:04:12.450> if<00:04:12.810> you
