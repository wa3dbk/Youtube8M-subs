00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
those lines so I kind of modified it to

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.920 
those lines so I kind of modified it to
fit<00:00:43.219> you<00:00:44.219> know<00:00:44.340> more<00:00:44.579> normal<00:00:44.969> Lego<00:00:45.210> colors<00:00:45.660> and

fit you know more normal Lego colors and

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.889 
fit you know more normal Lego colors and
his<00:00:46.079> more<00:00:46.500> modern<00:00:46.860> color<00:00:47.100> scheme<00:00:47.489> got<00:00:48.390> yellow

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
his more modern color scheme got yellow

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.760 
his more modern color scheme got yellow
red<00:00:49.469> and<00:00:49.500> blue<00:00:49.800> and<00:00:50.660> then<00:00:51.660> for<00:00:52.230> the<00:00:52.289> shoes<00:00:52.559> i

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
red and blue and then for the shoes i

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.950 
red and blue and then for the shoes i
just<00:00:52.949> used<00:00:53.129> black<00:00:53.430> and<00:00:53.789> since<00:00:54.270> i<00:00:54.420> don't

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
just used black and since i don't

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.130 
just used black and since i don't
exactly<00:00:55.199> have<00:00:55.500> a<00:00:55.530> lot<00:00:55.649> of<00:00:55.829> brown<00:00:56.250> bricks<00:00:57.140> for

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140

the hair i also just use black and I

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.290 
the hair i also just use black and I
guess<00:01:02.070> that's<00:01:02.190> really<00:01:02.489> about<00:01:02.579> it<00:01:02.820> for<00:01:03.059> it<00:01:03.180> the

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
guess that's really about it for it the

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.789 
guess that's really about it for it the
only<00:01:03.449> part<00:01:03.690> i'm<00:01:03.780> disappointed<00:01:04.320> with<00:01:04.409> is<00:01:04.619> right

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
only part i'm disappointed with is right

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.350 
only part i'm disappointed with is right
here<00:01:05.070> I<00:01:05.250> didn't<00:01:05.489> have<00:01:05.610> any<00:01:05.729> fancy<00:01:06.180> way<00:01:06.330> of

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
here I didn't have any fancy way of

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.679 
here I didn't have any fancy way of
getting<00:01:07.290> these<00:01:07.409> pieces<00:01:07.710> to<00:01:08.010> stick<00:01:08.220> together

00:01:08.679 --> 00:01:08.689 
getting these pieces to stick together

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:11.600 
getting these pieces to stick together
while<00:01:09.689> I<00:01:09.720> do<00:01:09.900> have<00:01:10.320> a<00:01:10.619> black<00:01:11.040> piece<00:01:11.340> that<00:01:11.580> I

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
while I do have a black piece that I

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:18.499 
while I do have a black piece that I
could<00:01:11.939> use<00:01:11.970> right<00:01:16.009> around<00:01:17.009> here<00:01:17.460> so<00:01:18.210> I<00:01:18.240> had<00:01:18.479> to

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
could use right around here so I had to

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.230 
could use right around here so I had to
just<00:01:18.780> find<00:01:19.020> it<00:01:19.430> you<00:01:20.430> know<00:01:20.520> one<00:01:20.759> with<00:01:20.970> the<00:01:21.090> two

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
holes in it and these little tubes with

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:24.950 
holes in it and these little tubes with
the<00:01:23.460> stunt<00:01:23.729> in<00:01:23.790> the<00:01:23.880> end<00:01:24.030> I<00:01:24.299> don't<00:01:24.659> have<00:01:24.840> any

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960

the stunt in the end I don't have any
yellow<00:01:25.290> piece<00:01:25.530> that<00:01:25.890> could<00:01:26.900> receive<00:01:27.950> that

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
yellow piece that could receive that

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.090 
yellow piece that could receive that
essentially<00:01:29.759> to<00:01:29.970> connect<00:01:30.270> it<00:01:30.390> better<00:01:31.100> but

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
essentially to connect it better but

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.789 
essentially to connect it better but
overall<00:01:32.400> still<00:01:32.520> pretty<00:01:32.970> cool<00:01:33.150> um<00:01:33.799> will
