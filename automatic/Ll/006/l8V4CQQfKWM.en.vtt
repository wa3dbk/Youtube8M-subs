00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:14.650
 do 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:29.130
 hello here is the meaningful again 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.480
 internet driving school 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.740
 I am very glad that you are there 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.960
 Welcome to my 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.910
 youtube channel today with one for you 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.829
 very important video namely the 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.020
 correct seat adjustment I have me 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.030
 thought if the split into two parts 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.800
 I'll be a little bit 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.480
 the basics explain why why 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.940
 and why you sit down 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.440
 I should set appropriate 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.790
 would like to achieve that, of course 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.860
 they did not just hear it 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:53.640
 but that really is 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:55.769
 can follow and understand 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.550
 In the second part I will be able to guide you 

00:00:55.769 --> 00:00:58.920
 take out there 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.570
 We'll go to a greeting 7 and if 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.230
 it then together the seat optimally 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.789
 to adjust 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.820
 I'm going to be a little bit 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:07.619
 continue to pick it up just for you 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.050
 understanding and that there are so 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.940
 called active and there is the passive one 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:14.670
 Safety in the car Active safety 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:16.289
 that's all that contributes to that 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.550
 An accident can not happen 

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:19.500
 these are first and foremost the 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:20.729
 electronic helper has your car to 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.280
 example abs and esp 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:26.429
 that can be the headlight of the 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.380
 in darkness and enough of it 

00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:29.929
 illuminates so that you can observe 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.039
 But that is also the seat adjustment 

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:34.050
 dennis something with the great 

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:35.910
 Porsche ceramic brake in the vehicle 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:37.500
 if you do not have the appropriate brands 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:39.899
 pressure on the pedal because he gets one 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.550
 has wrong attitude or you are 

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:43.259
 you are able to pass the obstacle 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:46.020
 think because we are too far from the steering wheel 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.979
 So, sitting away, we already see that 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.170
 sitting position is really real 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:51.509
 important is the passive safety that is 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.800
 everything that contributes to that when I have the 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.300
 accident can not prevent that 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:56.489
 I veto here as little as possible 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:57.840
 hurt me as little as possible that would be 

00:01:56.489 --> 00:01:59.640
 the good example of the belt tensioners 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.039
 the lord beck the knutsch the 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.819
 crumple front where the engine is but 

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:07.050
 also your attitude because if i 

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:09.090
 have been wrong in the car 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:12.300
 I have a significantly increased accident and 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:14.099
 risk of injury and solely from this 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.480
 background you see already that is 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:17.280
 really important is the seat 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.629
 adjust accordingly if you 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.280
 later maybe one day 

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:21.989
 Safety training then participates 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.270
 Will you follow your theories? 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:26.450
 go out before he with the practical 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:27.980
 Exercises begin to line up 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:29.450
 All participants put in theirs 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.849
 Vehicles and the structure goes from 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:33.530
 vehicle to vehicle and looks at the 

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:36.349
 fitting setting new hand, it is extremely 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:38.269
 rarely that candidates are sitting there 

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:39.050
 where you do not have anything at all 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:40.910
 can change 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:41.989
 these are often all the participants 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:44.780
 it's always safe when you're the same 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:46.970
 participated in the problem lies 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:49.220
 of course in that in most 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:52.519
 never do that to the people properly 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:54.190
 it has been explained why not in the 

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:56.810
 car should sit like they do and 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:59.120
 then comes a situation that you stop 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:00.799
 I've been talking so long and driving 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:02.330
 human is a habitual animal and then 

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:03.319
 Of course it is unpleasant if I am 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:05.510
 then suddenly with a very different one 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:08.150
 to drive through the area 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:10.819
 so many participants then fall after the 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:12.470
 Return to your old pattern 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:14.420
 and then stop the seat 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:15.680
 again according as it is a 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:17.450
 just before were used 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:19.640
 though that certainly is not the safe one 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:20.989
 and the better variant is here you are 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:23.599
 Of course now clearly in the advantage 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:25.730
 because the beginning of the novice at the beginning 

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:27.170
 your education and you know the 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:29.450
 bad sitting attitude actually 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:30.579
 not so it is for you whole 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:33.470
 normal 

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:35.120
 unusual about it and that's why 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:36.650
 really so elementary and so important 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.940
 that you have this video now 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:40.220
 really look closely and a bit 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:41.750
 he really takes it to heart 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:43.970
 her remaining car driver life 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:47.150
 Sit in the car sensibly and safely 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:49.190
 Maybe it could be very important 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:50.959
 who the video times your parents or 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:51.980
 show my friends when you are in 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:53.810
 the cars looks and you see 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:55.250
 appropriate seat settings then 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:57.139
 Maybe you have that yourself 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:59.090
 it needs and maybe last of the one 

00:03:57.139 --> 00:04:01.340
 or sure to convince others 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:03.019
 and to this videos and rethink 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:04.370
 just his seat adjustment me 

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:06.889
 I'll try my hand here 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:09.590
 auto scooter issue and would 

00:04:06.889 --> 00:04:11.569
 we say now meet outside at 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:15.819
 car again and then get together 

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:15.819
 Together, adjust the seat correctly
