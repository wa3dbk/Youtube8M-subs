we<00:01:02.960> looked<00:01:03.170> at<00:01:03.320> a<00:01:03.350> number<00:01:03.590> of<00:01:03.770> ways<00:01:03.890> to<00:01:04.580> improve

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:05.300 
we looked at a number of ways to improve

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:08.320 
we looked at a number of ways to improve
our<00:01:05.720> production<00:01:06.350> process<00:01:06.920> and<00:01:06.950> we<00:01:07.729> recognize

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:08.330 
our production process and we recognize

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.460 
our production process and we recognize
that<00:01:08.979> operator<00:01:09.979> labor<00:01:10.340> was<00:01:10.670> one<00:01:10.850> of<00:01:10.970> our<00:01:11.120> most

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:11.470 
that operator labor was one of our most

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:13.810 
that operator labor was one of our most
significant<00:01:12.470> constraints<00:01:13.160> to<00:01:13.310> growing<00:01:13.550> the

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:13.820 
significant constraints to growing the

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:17.770 
significant constraints to growing the
business<00:01:14.000> and<00:01:15.100> as<00:01:16.100> we<00:01:16.250> researched<00:01:16.820> our<00:01:17.390> cost

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:17.780 
business and as we researched our cost

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:20.080 
business and as we researched our cost
of<00:01:17.990> operating<00:01:18.680> we<00:01:18.860> decided<00:01:19.820> that<00:01:19.940> we<00:01:20.060> really

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:20.090 
of operating we decided that we really

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:23.359 
of operating we decided that we really
thought<00:01:20.600> robotics<00:01:21.259> was<00:01:21.440> the<00:01:21.560> right<00:01:21.740> way<00:01:21.920> to<00:01:21.979> go

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
thought robotics was the right way to go

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.480 
thought robotics was the right way to go
we<00:01:23.909> went<00:01:24.119> and<00:01:24.329> engaged<00:01:25.049> with<00:01:25.259> a<00:01:25.490> traditional

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
we went and engaged with a traditional

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.789 
we went and engaged with a traditional
robotics<00:01:27.060> integrator<00:01:27.509> and<00:01:27.780> you<00:01:28.079> know<00:01:28.200> going

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
robotics integrator and you know going

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.679 
robotics integrator and you know going
into<00:01:29.070> it<00:01:29.159> our<00:01:29.399> hope<00:01:29.610> was<00:01:29.850> that<00:01:30.119> hey<00:01:30.299> we<00:01:30.479> could

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
into it our hope was that hey we could

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.840 
into it our hope was that hey we could
we<00:01:30.899> could<00:01:31.049> robotically<00:01:31.649> load<00:01:31.860> everything<00:01:32.189> we

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
we could robotically load everything we

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.520 
we could robotically load everything we
went<00:01:33.030> out<00:01:33.180> and<00:01:33.329> got<00:01:33.420> quotes<00:01:33.840> of<00:01:34.140> various

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
went out and got quotes of various

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.450 
went out and got quotes of various
companies<00:01:34.829> and<00:01:35.399> found<00:01:35.970> that<00:01:36.299> the<00:01:36.630> costs<00:01:37.259> were

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:37.460 
companies and found that the costs were

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.580 
companies and found that the costs were
prohibited<00:01:38.460> for<00:01:38.700> a<00:01:38.729> small<00:01:38.970> shop<00:01:39.299> like<00:01:39.509> ours<00:01:39.750> by

prohibited for a small shop like ours by

prohibited for a small shop like ours by
the<00:01:40.649> time<00:01:41.130> they<00:01:41.759> were<00:01:41.789> getting<00:01:42.270> ready<00:01:42.420> to

we<00:01:46.289> would<00:01:46.500> be<00:01:46.649> updating<00:01:47.100> the<00:01:47.220> part<00:01:47.490> and<00:01:47.729> it

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
we would be updating the part and it

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.580 
we would be updating the part and it
would<00:01:48.000> all<00:01:48.119> be<00:01:48.149> obsolete<00:01:48.570> it<00:01:49.049> just<00:01:49.229> wasn't

going to work and we decided we could

we<00:05:06.170> moved<00:05:06.440> into<00:05:06.620> this<00:05:06.830> facility<00:05:07.100> two<00:05:07.700> years

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:07.970 
we moved into this facility two years

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:09.670 
we moved into this facility two years
ago<00:05:08.240> and<00:05:08.480> thought<00:05:08.630> it<00:05:08.810> would<00:05:08.870> last<00:05:09.080> us<00:05:09.380> five

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:09.680 
ago and thought it would last us five

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:12.580 
ago and thought it would last us five
years<00:05:10.100> we're<00:05:10.850> doubling<00:05:11.300> in<00:05:11.480> size<00:05:11.510> next<00:05:12.200> year

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:12.590 
years we're doubling in size next year

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:15.610 
years we're doubling in size next year
and<00:05:12.770> as<00:05:13.550> far<00:05:13.790> as<00:05:13.910> we're<00:05:14.150> concerned<00:05:14.180> we<00:05:15.020> think

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:15.620 
and as far as we're concerned we think

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:17.590 
and as far as we're concerned we think
that<00:05:15.950> we<00:05:16.430> will<00:05:16.610> probably<00:05:16.880> be<00:05:17.210> able<00:05:17.360> to

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:17.600 
that we will probably be able to

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:19.990 
that we will probably be able to
continue<00:05:17.990> on<00:05:18.320> that<00:05:18.470> trajectory<00:05:18.760> for<00:05:19.760> at<00:05:19.880> least

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:20.000 
continue on that trajectory for at least

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.350 
continue on that trajectory for at least
the<00:05:20.210> next<00:05:20.360> five<00:05:20.660> years

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:22.360 
the next five years

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:25.260 
the next five years
my<00:05:22.900> vision<00:05:23.319> for<00:05:23.349> recluse<00:05:23.919> 12<00:05:24.340> years<00:05:24.669> ago<00:05:24.819> was

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:25.270 
my vision for recluse 12 years ago was

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:28.559 
my vision for recluse 12 years ago was
to<00:05:25.650> to<00:05:26.650> change<00:05:26.979> the<00:05:27.280> way<00:05:27.460> people<00:05:27.759> rode

00:05:28.559 --> 00:05:28.569 
to to change the way people rode

00:05:28.569 --> 00:05:30.779 
to to change the way people rode
motorcycles<00:05:28.840> I<00:05:29.620> would<00:05:29.949> say<00:05:30.099> the<00:05:30.250> vision<00:05:30.550> for

00:05:30.779 --> 00:05:30.789 
motorcycles I would say the vision for

00:05:30.789 --> 00:05:34.439 
motorcycles I would say the vision for
versa<00:05:31.120> built<00:05:31.479> is<00:05:31.659> largely<00:05:32.110> the<00:05:32.319> same<00:05:33.150> my<00:05:34.150> hope

00:05:34.439 --> 00:05:34.449 
versa built is largely the same my hope

00:05:34.449 --> 00:05:39.930 
versa built is largely the same my hope
is<00:05:34.750> that<00:05:35.020> in<00:05:35.879> five<00:05:36.879> years<00:05:36.909> that<00:05:37.979> we<00:05:38.979> have<00:05:39.190> we

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:39.940 
is that in five years that we have we

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:42.420 
is that in five years that we have we
have<00:05:40.060> made<00:05:40.330> a<00:05:40.360> substantial<00:05:41.349> impact<00:05:41.710> and<00:05:42.039> on

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:42.430 
have made a substantial impact and on

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:45.719 
have made a substantial impact and on
how<00:05:43.530> CNC<00:05:44.530> manufacturing<00:05:45.220> is<00:05:45.340> done<00:05:45.490> in<00:05:45.639> the

00:05:45.719 --> 00:05:45.729 
how CNC manufacturing is done in the
