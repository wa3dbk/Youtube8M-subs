00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
one location and there's a couple of

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:17.420 
one location and there's a couple of
different<00:00:16.650> ways<00:00:16.770> that<00:00:16.830> you<00:00:17.010> can<00:00:17.160> put<00:00:17.340> this

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
different ways that you can put this

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.429 
different ways that you can put this
together<00:00:17.609> you<00:00:18.060> can<00:00:18.570> definitely<00:00:18.750> use<00:00:19.410> a

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
together you can definitely use a

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.040 
together you can definitely use a
computer<00:00:19.980> program<00:00:20.359> sometimes<00:00:21.359> it<00:00:21.810> takes<00:00:21.990> a

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
computer program sometimes it takes a

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:23.269 
computer program sometimes it takes a
little<00:00:22.109> while<00:00:22.350> to<00:00:22.410> learn<00:00:22.740> the<00:00:22.890> different

little while to learn the different
nuances<00:00:23.820> that<00:00:23.880> are<00:00:24.090> in<00:00:24.269> each<00:00:24.480> program<00:00:24.750> of

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
nuances that are in each program of

nuances that are in each program of
different<00:00:25.650> symbols<00:00:26.070> how<00:00:26.310> to<00:00:26.369> make<00:00:26.580> it<00:00:26.699> look

designate where the center will be then

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.340 
designate where the center will be then
after<00:00:53.850> that<00:00:54.000> you<00:00:54.210> can<00:00:54.239> put<00:00:54.360> in<00:00:54.600> your<00:00:54.750> specific

then once what you want to do is use the

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.880 
then once what you want to do is use the

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
specific symbols that you need to for

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.969 
specific symbols that you need to for

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
each puts positions job in this case if

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.380 
each puts positions job in this case if
we<00:01:11.070> have<00:01:11.100> our<00:01:11.250> offensive<00:01:11.820> lineman<00:01:12.210> all

blocking zone blocking to the right you

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.120 
blocking zone blocking to the right you
would<00:01:14.640> use<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:15.030> correct<00:01:15.530> symbols<00:01:16.530> to

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
would use the correct symbols to

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.490 
would use the correct symbols to
illustrate<00:01:17.640> that<00:01:17.880> if<00:01:18.119> you<00:01:19.110> have<00:01:19.229> your<00:01:19.350> wide

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
illustrate that if you have your wide

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.980 
illustrate that if you have your wide
receivers<00:01:19.880> running<00:01:20.880> patterns<00:01:21.509> you<00:01:21.780> want<00:01:21.869> to

receivers running patterns you want to

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.130 
receivers running patterns you want to

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
use the correct pattern notations if

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.980 
use the correct pattern notations if
you're<00:01:25.380> unsure<00:01:25.619> about<00:01:25.979> those<00:01:26.220> you<00:01:26.580> can<00:01:26.790> also

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:26.990 
you're unsure about those you can also

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:30.080 
you're unsure about those you can also
you<00:01:27.990> know<00:01:28.020> definitely<00:01:28.500> look<00:01:28.619> that<00:01:28.799> up<00:01:29.009> and<00:01:29.159> and

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
you know definitely look that up and and

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.410 
you know definitely look that up and and
ask<00:01:30.930> other<00:01:31.170> coaches<00:01:31.560> because<00:01:31.650> there's<00:01:31.890> some

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:32.420 
ask other coaches because there's some

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.520 
ask other coaches because there's some
traditionally<00:01:33.420> used<00:01:33.659> symbols<00:01:34.200> that<00:01:34.259> are<00:01:34.380> used

traditionally used symbols that are used

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.440 
traditionally used symbols that are used
for<00:01:34.680> everything<00:01:34.920> and<00:01:35.790> then<00:01:35.970> depending<00:01:36.210> on<00:01:36.390> the

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
for everything and then depending on the

things like that

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.039
