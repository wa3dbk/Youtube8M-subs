00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:13.590
 who are just starting a career 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:18.090
 yourself and the trap in which they themselves and 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:20.910
 hit the first trap it's low 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.810
 cost of course every self respecting 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.050
 master 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:29.189
 immediately put the minimum cost on 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:32.489
 your work and then increase the cost 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:35.790
 will stretch for long months or 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:39.200
 even years while it is from its 300 500 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:42.329
 rubles will reach that figure 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:45.000
 which he himself thinks is worthy 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:47.430
 earn really pass very 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.120
 a lot of time and his clients 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:54.750
 resist the rising cost himself 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:58.620
 a person is afraid increases the cost of it 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:02.690
 always scary because it entails 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:05.610
 yourself and for this endless correction 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:08.400
 again we are afraid to remain without customers 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.150
 and therefore we take on the collection from others 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.310
 masters 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:15.450
 we take on correction when a person has 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:17.909
 5 eyelashes left on both eyes we take 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:22.350
 for correction in the first in the second in 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:27.150
 third 25 times in a row and in the end we 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:29.549
 working for half the cost of that 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.020
 the figure that we planned for some reason 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:35.360
 have you work two times cheaper 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:38.369
 actually permanent one person not 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:41.220
 escaped from the master only for the reason 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:44.939
 what he refused to do 15 times 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:46.990
 correction set limit 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:50.470
 reasonable restrictions 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:53.409
 on the collection that you register on 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:56.890
 advertising space in the price list is appropriate 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:02:00.909
 set limits that it can 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:05.409
 we do not take correction from others 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:08.970
 masters we make correction only one 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:12.310
 again and then this is a new build and 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:14.410
 possible timing sock some 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:17.410
 boundedness is more than three 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:23.230
 weeks a man wears eyelashes this already 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:28.090
 new sediment trap which flows from 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:32.170
 the first point about the price is gradual 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:34.480
 value increase every time we 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:38.590
 we increase the cost by some 100 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:43.840
 rubles 50 percent of customers 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:48.610
 go up to for these one hundred people 100 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:50.860
 rubles is a lot of money 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:52.030
 no matter how much you raise the cost of everything 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:56.670
 time will go 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:03:01.359
 50 people obtained if traced 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:05.650
 all this is a price increase for everything about 

00:03:01.359 --> 00:03:07.989
 part of your career can be lost from 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:11.680
 several hundred to several thousand 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:14.850
 customers and these are the people who search for 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:17.739
 you spent your strength your time 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:23.200
 maybe money invested in advertising 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:26.950
 you tried to like him as a person 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:29.440
 as a master and show professional 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:30.579
 results in eight percent of the masters 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.980
 repeated 

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:35.910
 and will repeat this path gradual 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:35.910
 increase in value 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:44.820
 out here there 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:50.770
 we set a fixed cost 

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:54.340
 on building for one year that is when 

00:03:50.770 --> 00:04:00.280
 we have a question how to assign a price for 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:04:02.950
 build-up we take that figure for the sake of 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:06.130
 which we are ready to work through 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:10.720
 the year is not now when we are still there 

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:13.380
 newbie still can not do anything else what what 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:16.810
 about me colleagues say neighbors will say 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:21.840
 through Burak not to increase the year 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:25.060
 cost and year not to lose customers 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:27.840
 starting from day one only 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:27.840
 accumulate
