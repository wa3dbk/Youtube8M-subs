00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:10.430
 The xperia z 3 compact is a phone 

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:12.139
 high end with the curiosity of having 

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:14.570
 In addition to a group of specifications 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:17.090
 of tip a comfortable size and quite 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:19.640
 easy to use this is a formula that 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:22.310
 sony already used once before with the sony 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:24.230
 xperia z 1 compact a phone that causes 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:26.089
 a very good impression and won the 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:28.429
 heart of people who wanted a 

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:30.109
 high- end android phone but that 

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:33.530
 they did not want to have to carry screens 

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:35.480
 5 inches in your pockets 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:37.250
 physical dimensions of this terminal are 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:39.170
 same as the sony xperia z 1 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.420
 compact a phone that was released at 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:43.550
 beginning of the year one of the changes that 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:45.620
 it can be appreciated at first sight is the 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:47.420
 reduction of lateral edges something 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:49.310
 that allows you to place one more screen 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:51.920
 large inside the device without 

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:53.960
 affect your portability the panels 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.550
 glass on the front and back of the phone 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.650
 they make the device have that 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:59.450
 feeling of luxury and a premium finish 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:02.060
 but it can also make it something 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:03.500
 slippery in the hands instead of a 

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:06.049
 aluminum frame in this version 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:08.450
 we will find a silicone frame that does not 

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:10.070
 it's not bad the device can be 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:11.750
 hold comfortably and your appearance 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:14.390
 translucent is a lot 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:16.340
 on the side edges of the apparatus like 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:18.110
 it is already customary in sony products 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:21.140
 we will find protective covers 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:23.450
 for the sim and card charge ports 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.910
 sd which guarantee the amazing 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:27.860
 capacity of the xperia z3 compact 

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:30.110
 resist immersion in water up to 2 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:32.479
 meters deep for 30 minutes 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:34.880
 On the other hand, the sony screen 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:37.100
 xperia z 3 compact is fine but 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.869
 could have been much better 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.820
 resolution is the same as that of the zeta 1 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:42.920
 compact and being a larger screen 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:44.630
 it looks with less definition the images 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.240
 and on several occasions you can notice 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:49.040
 the pixels but one of the aspects that 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.990
 are and emphasizes on your phone is the 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:53.450
 camera in the first uses with the 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:55.430
 sony xperia z 3 compact camera 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:57.560
 you can appreciate its great quality something that 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:00.619
 mainly due to the famous sensor 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:02.300
 20 7 megapixel sound and in this 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:04.550
 edition to the inclusion of the capacity 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:06.890
 to record video in 4k resolutions 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:09.289
 slow motion and different modes 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:10.789
 completely new but clear after 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:12.260
 of a time and the appearance of 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:14.300
 Non-ideal conditions can be noticed 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:16.459
 several things that are not so good from the 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:18.060
 sony camera mainly that in 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:20.610
 poorly lit environments 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:22.110
 little usually fails and you have to take several 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.450
 photographs to capture the 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:26.489
 moment entering the world of 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.260
 technical specifications of this equipment 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:30.270
 at this point all the smartphones of 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:33.060
 high-end with android have a hardware 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:35.459
 almost the same internal he ships z3 compact 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.470
 is not the exception this team has 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:39.810
 with a four snapdragon processor 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:42.060
 cores running at a speed of 2.4 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:45.000
 gigahertz 2 gigs of ram memory and 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:47.130
 android 4.4 kitkat that will be updated 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.650
 in early 2015 as 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:51.360
 has reported is the phone itself 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:52.860
 usually slows down by stronger than 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.330
 be the task that is imposed and 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:56.130
 maintains a stable performance the 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:57.299
 most of the time again the 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:59.190
 performance of range terminals 

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:00.840
 high is no longer a differential factor 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:02.519
 all the releases of this year 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.019
 they have a similar configuration and 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:06.930
 can deal perfectly with 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:08.280
 any app or video game that yes in the 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:10.319
 software section the layer of 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.420
 Sony personalization does not try 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:14.340
 keep android in its pure form and 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.870
 modifies many of the interactions and 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.730
 ways to configure the use of 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:19.769
 device curiously in this version 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:21.209
 there is a powerful engine of themes and a 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:22.950
 store since users can 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:24.870
 download graphic packages that 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:27.360
 they will completely change the appearance 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:29.250
 operative but the use of this skin is not 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:31.140
 intuitive and full of animations 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:33.030
 unnecessary in addition to having several 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:34.950
 Hidden menus if you come from a 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:37.110
 phone from another manufacturer the process 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:39.299
 to learn how to use the xperia z3 compact 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:41.159
 it's not the simplest thing in the world but there 

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:42.690
 to highlight that curiously you can 

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:45.060
 find some very features 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:47.579
 useful inside this terminal what 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:49.049
 subtract sony is to come even closer to 

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:51.360
 Google's vision of its 

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:53.220
 mobile operating system a path that already 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:55.470
 have successfully taken other manufacturers 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:57.569
 when it comes to the battery this 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:59.459
 terminal fulfills the task and succeeded with 

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:02.220
 success keep going on for a 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:04.650
 little more than 24 hours all this under a 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:07.019
 Intense use of spotify and netflix messages 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:08.910
 of text and calls is most likely 

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:10.650
 that the sony xperia z 3 compact arrives 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:12.930
 with life at your bedside table 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:15.090
 room ready to be loaded with 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:16.979
 new to summarize everything many 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:19.440
 phones make big bets but the 

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:21.479
 series of devices excluded z3 the 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:22.919
 does all the phone have one of the 

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:24.419
 cameras with higher resolution in the 

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:26.250
 market one of the highest 

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:27.990
 Resistance to water and large dust 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:30.030
 battery life and in general some 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:31.590
 tip specifications the problem 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:33.180
 real with these devices 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:35.130
 is the way they are and throws them to 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:37.080
 market with less than six months of 

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:38.820
 distance between releases the improvements 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:40.890
 which can be seen in the different 

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:42.840
 iterations of this device are minimal 

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:46.010
 and for many it's not worth making a 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:46.010
 update to the new generation
