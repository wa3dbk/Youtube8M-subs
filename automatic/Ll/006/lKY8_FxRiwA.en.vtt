you play thats in this game that really

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:53.490 
you play thats in this game that really
wouldn't<00:04:52.389> have<00:04:52.479> been<00:04:52.630> possible<00:04:52.780> if<00:04:53.229> we<00:04:53.260> made

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:53.500 
wouldn't have been possible if we made

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:55.760 
wouldn't have been possible if we made
the<00:04:53.620> game<00:04:53.770> a<00:04:53.800> couple<00:04:54.010> of<00:04:54.190> years<00:04:54.250> ago

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:55.770

the game a couple of years ago
expectations<00:04:56.770> are<00:04:56.860> really<00:04:57.130> complicated<00:04:58.090> when

00:04:58.620 --> 00:04:58.630 
expectations are really complicated when

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:00.420
