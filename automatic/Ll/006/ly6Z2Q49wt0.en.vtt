00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
up really well this is actually produced

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.830 
up really well this is actually produced
by<00:01:04.320> splitting<00:01:04.830> silurian<00:01:05.610> matrix<00:01:06.060> who<00:01:06.600> do<00:01:06.810> a

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
lot of quality top level strategy games

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.120 
lot of quality top level strategy games
however<00:01:09.450> generally<00:01:10.049> their<00:01:10.530> interface<00:01:10.920> and

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
however generally their interface and

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.050 
however generally their interface and
things<00:01:11.340> like<00:01:11.430> that<00:01:11.490> are<00:01:11.700> not<00:01:11.850> the<00:01:11.970> most

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
things like that are not the most

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.700 
things like that are not the most
impressive<00:01:12.540> part<00:01:12.570> this<00:01:13.260> one<00:01:13.439> though<00:01:13.530> has<00:01:13.680> a

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
impressive part this one though has a

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.100 
impressive part this one though has a
very<00:01:14.010> interesting<00:01:14.299> interface<00:01:15.299> some<00:01:15.960> of<00:01:16.049> the

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
very interesting interface some of the

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.230 
very interesting interface some of the
things<00:01:16.320> really<00:01:16.619> seemed<00:01:16.860> to<00:01:16.890> work<00:01:17.130> well<00:01:17.189> as<00:01:18.150> you

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
things really seemed to work well as you

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.420 
things really seemed to work well as you
can<00:01:18.330> see<00:01:18.390> you<00:01:18.570> can<00:01:18.600> actually<00:01:19.020> move<00:01:19.350> this<00:01:19.830> main

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
can see you can actually move this main

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.609 
can see you can actually move this main
dialog<00:01:20.970> box<00:01:21.210> around<00:01:21.509> the<00:01:21.720> screen<00:01:21.960> which<00:01:22.590> is

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
dialog box around the screen which is

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.499 
dialog box around the screen which is
great<00:01:23.009> though<00:01:23.189> it<00:01:23.340> always<00:01:23.490> still<00:01:24.030> seems<00:01:24.270> to<00:01:24.360> be

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
great though it always still seems to be

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.570 
great though it always still seems to be
in<00:01:24.630> the<00:01:24.750> way<00:01:24.900> but<00:01:25.470> there<00:01:25.650> is<00:01:25.770> a<00:01:25.799> neat<00:01:26.159> idea<00:01:26.310> and

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
in the way but there is a neat idea and

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.249 
in the way but there is a neat idea and
not<00:01:26.700> something<00:01:27.060> I've<00:01:27.180> seen<00:01:27.420> very<00:01:27.689> often<00:01:27.869> on

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
not something I've seen very often on

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.410 
not something I've seen very often on
the<00:01:28.470> platform

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
the platform

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.080 
the platform
combat<00:01:30.869> is<00:01:31.020> a<00:01:31.619> sort<00:01:32.040> of<00:01:32.070> risk<00:01:32.310> style<00:01:32.640> you

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
combat is a sort of risk style you

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.910 
combat is a sort of risk style you
choose<00:01:33.119> the<00:01:33.689> number<00:01:33.810> of<00:01:33.990> unions<00:01:34.259> you<00:01:34.439> wish<00:01:34.619> to

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
choose the number of unions you wish to

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.160 
choose the number of unions you wish to
send<00:01:35.340> a<00:01:35.460> battle<00:01:35.790> you<00:01:36.479> can<00:01:36.600> also<00:01:36.720> have<00:01:36.900> eyes<00:01:37.049> you

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
send a battle you can also have eyes you

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.630 
send a battle you can also have eyes you
can<00:01:37.259> see<00:01:37.320> upgraded<00:01:37.830> cards<00:01:38.130> that<00:01:38.340> give<00:01:38.369> your

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
can see upgraded cards that give your

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.100 
can see upgraded cards that give your
units<00:01:38.970> different<00:01:39.330> strengths<00:01:39.720> so<00:01:39.869> in<00:01:39.990> this

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
units different strengths so in this

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.649 
units different strengths so in this
case<00:01:40.320> I<00:01:40.649> have<00:01:40.710> tanks<00:01:41.220> and<00:01:41.430> I<00:01:41.939> have<00:01:42.240> an<00:01:42.420> upgrade

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
case I have tanks and I have an upgrade

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.620 
case I have tanks and I have an upgrade
that<00:01:42.840> allows<00:01:43.350> my<00:01:43.560> tanks<00:01:43.890> to<00:01:44.340> shoot<00:01:44.909> strong<00:01:45.270> or

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
that allows my tanks to shoot strong or

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.539 
that allows my tanks to shoot strong or
and<00:01:45.930> also<00:01:46.259> have<00:01:46.799> less<00:01:46.979> chance<00:01:47.009> of<00:01:47.340> breaking

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
and also have less chance of breaking

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.820 
and also have less chance of breaking
down<00:01:47.940> but<00:01:48.509> in<00:01:48.600> this<00:01:48.659> case<00:01:48.840> I<00:01:49.020> still<00:01:49.409> broke<00:01:49.649> down

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:49.830 
down but in this case I still broke down

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:53.029 
down but in this case I still broke down
but<00:01:50.759> then<00:01:51.720> also<00:01:51.930> loss<00:01:52.200> of<00:01:52.350> tank<00:01:52.530> it's<00:01:52.740> actually

00:01:53.029 --> 00:01:53.039 
but then also loss of tank it's actually

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:55.639 
but then also loss of tank it's actually
battle<00:01:53.399> is<00:01:53.460> not<00:01:53.580> going<00:01:53.850> too<00:01:53.970> well<00:01:54.000> for<00:01:54.210> me<00:01:54.649> but

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
battle is not going too well for me but

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.279 
battle is not going too well for me but
you<00:01:55.860> do<00:01:56.070> rounds<00:01:56.460> of<00:01:56.549> combat<00:01:56.970> so<00:01:57.330> the<00:01:58.020> attacker

00:01:58.279 --> 00:01:58.289 
you do rounds of combat so the attacker

00:01:58.289 --> 00:01:59.779 
you do rounds of combat so the attacker
will<00:01:58.619> always<00:01:58.799> go<00:01:58.950> first<00:01:59.159> and<00:01:59.369> if<00:01:59.460> there<00:01:59.610> are<00:01:59.640> no

00:01:59.779 --> 00:01:59.789 
will always go first and if there are no

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:01.520 
will always go first and if there are no
defenders<00:02:00.210> left<00:02:00.479> then<00:02:00.869> that<00:02:01.110> will<00:02:01.289> in<00:02:01.409> the

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
defenders left then that will in the

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.980 
defenders left then that will in the
battle<00:02:01.830> in<00:02:02.310> this<00:02:02.429> case<00:02:02.670> see<00:02:03.119> I<00:02:03.149> will<00:02:03.780> talk

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
battle in this case see I will talk

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.260 
battle in this case see I will talk

have that at this time but otherwise
it's<00:04:26.060> definitely<00:04:26.450> a<00:04:26.510> very<00:04:26.540> enjoyable<00:04:27.020> game

and a quirky one that I don't think

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:31.120 
and a quirky one that I don't think
isn't<00:04:29.840> anymore<00:04:30.170> so<00:04:30.470> this<00:04:30.590> is<00:04:30.710> a<00:04:30.740> great<00:04:30.890> way<00:04:31.070> to
