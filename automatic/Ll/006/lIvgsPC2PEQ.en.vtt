9ds<00:00:15.809> a<00:00:15.960> little<00:00:16.170> bit<00:00:16.289> ghetto<00:00:16.529> so<00:00:16.949> I<00:00:17.130> wanted<00:00:17.820> to

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
9ds a little bit ghetto so I wanted to

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:19.429 
9ds a little bit ghetto so I wanted to
take<00:00:18.090> it<00:00:18.210> off<00:00:18.359> so<00:00:18.690> I<00:00:18.930> did<00:00:19.080> a<00:00:19.140> little<00:00:19.230> bit<00:00:19.380> of

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
take it off so I did a little bit of

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.080 
take it off so I did a little bit of
research<00:00:19.680> I<00:00:19.890> thought<00:00:20.070> shouldn't<00:00:20.640> be<00:00:20.699> too<00:00:20.880> hard

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
research I thought shouldn't be too hard

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:22.880 
research I thought shouldn't be too hard
to<00:00:21.539> take<00:00:21.810> it<00:00:21.960> off<00:00:22.080> I<00:00:22.230> mean<00:00:22.350> it's<00:00:22.769> just

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
to take it off I mean it's just

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.580 
to take it off I mean it's just
basically<00:00:23.699> a<00:00:23.820> sticker<00:00:24.240> that<00:00:24.390> is<00:00:24.930> put<00:00:25.230> on<00:00:25.260> there

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
basically a sticker that is put on there

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.429 
basically a sticker that is put on there
and<00:00:25.710> then<00:00:25.830> eventually<00:00:26.010> it<00:00:26.820> adheres<00:00:27.420> to<00:00:27.720> it<00:00:27.869> so

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
and then eventually it adheres to it so

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:29.929 
and then eventually it adheres to it so
I<00:00:28.470> didn't<00:00:28.710> think<00:00:28.769> it'd<00:00:28.949> be<00:00:28.980> too<00:00:29.189> hard<00:00:29.460> well<00:00:29.699> I

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
I didn't think it'd be too hard well I

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.849 
I didn't think it'd be too hard well I
