00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
stuff immediately especially with a

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.320 
stuff immediately especially with a
great<00:01:11.160> quality<00:01:11.370> sensor<00:01:11.880> and<00:01:12.000> a<00:01:12.030> great<00:01:12.180> quality

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:13.800 
camera yeah and that's I think the

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:15.050 
camera yeah and that's I think the
biggest<00:01:13.890> difference<00:01:14.130> is<00:01:14.490> that<00:01:14.520> you<00:01:14.760> can<00:01:14.880> take

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
biggest difference is that you can take

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.150 
biggest difference is that you can take
pictures<00:01:15.330> with<00:01:15.600> your<00:01:15.810> smartphone<00:01:16.290> yeah<00:01:16.800> or

tablet however the image quality is

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:21.320 
tablet however the image quality is
never<00:01:19.440> going<00:01:19.680> to<00:01:19.740> compare<00:01:20.160> to<00:01:20.610> that<00:01:20.640> of<00:01:20.790> a<00:01:20.940> true

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330
