your<00:00:17.039> document<00:00:17.640> libraries<00:00:17.970> let<00:00:18.450> me<00:00:18.539> show<00:00:18.720> you

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:18.780 
your document libraries let me show you

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:20.930 
your document libraries let me show you
how<00:00:18.990> it's<00:00:19.170> set<00:00:19.440> up<00:00:19.470> and<00:00:19.710> configured<00:00:20.100> so<00:00:20.820> we're

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:20.940 
how it's set up and configured so we're

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:22.910 
how it's set up and configured so we're
going<00:00:21.060> to<00:00:21.120> activate<00:00:21.390> the<00:00:21.630> Start<00:00:21.900> screen<00:00:21.960> type

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
going to activate the Start screen type

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.570 
going to activate the Start screen type
in<00:00:23.160> file<00:00:24.060> history<00:00:24.360> and<00:00:25.220> drop<00:00:26.220> down<00:00:26.369> to

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.160 
in file history and drop down to
settings<00:00:26.850> and<00:00:27.210> we'll<00:00:27.360> see<00:00:27.539> it<00:00:27.630> right<00:00:27.810> up<00:00:27.960> here

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170

document libraries by default now I want

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:56.990 
document libraries by default now I want
to<00:00:55.530> show<00:00:55.649> you<00:00:55.710> a<00:00:55.770> couple<00:00:56.010> of<00:00:56.040> configuration

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
to show you a couple of configuration

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.119 
to show you a couple of configuration
options<00:00:57.090> here<00:00:57.570> so<00:00:58.140> some<00:00:58.739> of<00:00:58.800> the<00:00:58.890> things<00:00:59.040> that

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
options here so some of the things that

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.880 
options here so some of the things that
we<00:00:59.280> can<00:00:59.430> do<00:00:59.579> are<00:00:59.820> selecting<00:01:00.629> the<00:01:00.719> drive<00:01:00.960> if<00:01:01.170> the

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
we can do are selecting the drive if the

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.160 
we can do are selecting the drive if the
selected<00:01:02.579> drive<00:01:02.820> wasn't<00:01:03.539> the<00:01:03.750> one<00:01:03.899> that<00:01:04.049> we

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
selected drive wasn't the one that we

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.490 
selected drive wasn't the one that we
wanted<00:01:04.469> to<00:01:04.530> use<00:01:05.280> file<00:01:05.579> history<00:01:06.000> on<00:01:06.240> we<00:01:07.229> can

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
wanted to use file history on we can

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.830 
wanted to use file history on we can
exclude<00:01:07.920> folders<00:01:08.340> so<00:01:09.299> this<00:01:09.479> would<00:01:09.630> be<00:01:09.720> great

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
exclude folders so this would be great

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.690 
exclude folders so this would be great
if<00:01:10.020> we<00:01:10.140> have<00:01:10.290> a<00:01:10.320> large<00:01:10.680> volume<00:01:11.070> of<00:01:11.310> data<00:01:11.369> that

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
if we have a large volume of data that

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.520 
if we have a large volume of data that
we<00:01:11.970> don't<00:01:12.240> want<00:01:12.510> to<00:01:12.600> backup<00:01:12.750> using<00:01:13.200> file

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
we don't want to backup using file

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.230 
we don't want to backup using file
history<00:01:13.740> like<00:01:14.159> if<00:01:14.280> we<00:01:14.369> have<00:01:14.490> multiple<00:01:14.909> gigs

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
history like if we have multiple gigs

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.210 
history like if we have multiple gigs
per<00:01:15.630> file<00:01:15.900> of<00:01:16.200> videos<00:01:16.590> in<00:01:16.890> a<00:01:16.950> particular

per file of videos in a particular
folder<00:01:17.640> we<00:01:18.270> might<00:01:18.450> want<00:01:18.659> to<00:01:18.689> use<00:01:18.750> some<00:01:19.080> other

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:19.260 
folder we might want to use some other

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:20.780 
folder we might want to use some other
method<00:01:19.740> to<00:01:19.890> back<00:01:20.340> that<00:01:20.549> up

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
method to back that up

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.960 
method to back that up
based<00:01:21.240> on<00:01:21.390> the<00:01:21.540> hardware<00:01:21.840> we're<00:01:22.020> using<00:01:22.229> etc<00:01:22.970> we

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
based on the hardware we're using etc we

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.300 
based on the hardware we're using etc we
can<00:01:24.090> also<00:01:24.240> go<00:01:24.479> into<00:01:24.659> advanced<00:01:25.619> settings<00:01:26.159> and

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
can also go into advanced settings and

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.090 
can also go into advanced settings and
set<00:01:26.729> the<00:01:26.850> interval<00:01:27.299> at<00:01:27.570> which<00:01:27.830> file<00:01:28.830> history

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
set the interval at which file history

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.640 
set the interval at which file history
