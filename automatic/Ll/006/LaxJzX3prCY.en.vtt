00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
much of an f1 layer but of course as you

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.609 
much of an f1 layer but of course as you
know<00:01:12.360> if<00:01:12.510> you've<00:01:12.540> been<00:01:12.810> watching<00:01:12.990> we

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
know if you've been watching we

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.010 
know if you've been watching we
certainly<00:01:14.100> are<00:01:14.340> registering<00:01:14.880> one<00:01:15.150> we<00:01:15.840> had<00:01:15.990> a

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
certainly are registering one we had a

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.660 
certainly are registering one we had a
little<00:01:16.200> solar<00:01:16.470> active<00:01:16.830> region<00:01:17.159> kind<00:01:17.580> of

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
little solar active region kind of

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.090 
little solar active region kind of
emerged<00:01:17.939> over<00:01:18.119> the<00:01:18.270> southeastern<00:01:19.110> limb<00:01:19.350> this

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
emerged over the southeastern limb this

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.700 
emerged over the southeastern limb this
morning<00:01:20.520> really<00:01:21.299> becoming<00:01:21.659> pretty<00:01:22.290> complex

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
morning really becoming pretty complex

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.770 
morning really becoming pretty complex
pretty<00:01:23.009> quickly<00:01:23.310> morphing<00:01:23.939> very<00:01:24.240> quickly<00:01:24.570> and

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
pretty quickly morphing very quickly and

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.050 
pretty quickly morphing very quickly and
developing<00:01:25.200> a<00:01:25.290> number<00:01:25.560> of<00:01:25.710> sunspots<00:01:26.580> when<00:01:27.000> we

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
developing a number of sunspots when we

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.609 
developing a number of sunspots when we
take<00:01:27.270> a<00:01:27.299> look<00:01:27.479> at<00:01:27.630> it<00:01:27.689> magnetically<00:01:28.350> we<00:01:28.470> can

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
take a look at it magnetically we can

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.399 
take a look at it magnetically we can
see<00:01:28.740> there's<00:01:28.920> a<00:01:28.979> lot<00:01:29.159> of<00:01:29.189> little<00:01:29.430> spots<00:01:29.700> and

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:30.409 
see there's a lot of little spots and

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:33.260 
see there's a lot of little spots and
not<00:01:31.409> too<00:01:31.710> complex<00:01:32.310> yet<00:01:32.579> but<00:01:32.759> it's<00:01:32.880> still<00:01:33.060> very

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
not too complex yet but it's still very

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.690 
not too complex yet but it's still very
young<00:01:33.450> we<00:01:34.200> had<00:01:34.380> two<00:01:34.619> ejections<00:01:34.979> off<00:01:35.400> of<00:01:35.549> the
