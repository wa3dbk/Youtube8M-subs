do<00:02:03.719> both<00:02:03.930> together<00:02:04.079> so<00:02:04.350> you<00:02:04.439> keep<00:02:04.560> the

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
do both together so you keep the

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.600 
do both together so you keep the
pressure<00:02:04.979> on<00:02:05.159> the<00:02:05.250> front<00:02:05.280> one<00:02:05.579> as<00:02:05.700> you<00:02:05.820> do<00:02:05.939> it

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:07.610 
pressure on the front one as you do it

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:10.850 
pressure on the front one as you do it
latch<00:02:08.610> in<00:02:08.789> there<00:02:09.440> cause<00:02:10.440> that<00:02:10.470> just<00:02:10.770> that

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
latch in there cause that just that

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.110 
latch in there cause that just that
little<00:02:10.920> bit<00:02:11.190> extra<00:02:11.400> and<00:02:12.140> a<00:02:13.849> little<00:02:14.849> bit<00:02:14.940> just

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
little bit extra and a little bit just

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.020 
little bit extra and a little bit just
here<00:02:15.209> you'll<00:02:15.989> see<00:02:16.489> what<00:02:17.489> that<00:02:17.520> allows<00:02:17.880> you<00:02:18.000> to

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
here you'll see what that allows you to

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.990 
here you'll see what that allows you to
do<00:02:18.330> is<00:02:18.650> to<00:02:19.650> pull<00:02:20.040> this<00:02:20.220> drawer<00:02:20.489> out<00:02:20.640> a<00:02:20.670> little

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
do is to pull this drawer out a little

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.180 
do is to pull this drawer out a little
further<00:02:21.239> as<00:02:21.510> well<00:02:21.800> and<00:02:22.800> now<00:02:22.920> what<00:02:23.069> we're

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
further as well and now what we're

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:25.670 
further as well and now what we're
aiming<00:02:23.280> to<00:02:23.459> do<00:02:23.670> is<00:02:23.700> just<00:02:24.090> in<00:02:24.300> here<00:02:24.569> you'll<00:02:25.440> see

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
aiming to do is just in here you'll see

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.830 
aiming to do is just in here you'll see
a<00:02:25.920> silver<00:02:26.250> reflector<00:02:26.519> I'll<00:02:27.480> get<00:02:27.599> a<00:02:27.630> close-up

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
a silver reflector I'll get a close-up

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:33.350 
a silver reflector I'll get a close-up
of<00:02:28.140> that<00:02:30.230> just<00:02:31.230> here<00:02:31.380> that<00:02:32.000> little<00:02:33.000> silver

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
of that just here that little silver

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.229 
of that just here that little silver
reflector<00:02:33.870> there<00:02:34.080> is<00:02:34.760> what<00:02:35.760> the<00:02:35.849> problem<00:02:36.150> is

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:36.239 
reflector there is what the problem is

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:37.610 
reflector there is what the problem is
basically<00:02:36.390> that<00:02:36.690> that<00:02:37.080> gets<00:02:37.260> covered<00:02:37.440> in

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
basically that that gets covered in

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.130 
basically that that gets covered in
toner<00:02:37.890> so<00:02:38.130> wait<00:02:38.250> you<00:02:38.340> do<00:02:39.000> you<00:02:39.269> just<00:02:39.450> want<00:02:40.080> the

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
toner so wait you do you just want the

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.620 
toner so wait you do you just want the
tailor<00:02:40.350> off<00:02:40.470> there<00:02:40.650> and<00:02:41.250> just<00:02:42.239> spin<00:02:42.480> this

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
tailor off there and just spin this

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:47.390 
tailor off there and just spin this
around<00:02:42.860> zoom<00:02:43.860> back<00:02:43.980> a<00:02:44.040> bit<00:02:45.920> zoom<00:02:46.920> back<00:02:47.100> a<00:02:47.160> bit

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
around zoom back a bit zoom back a bit

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:52.130 
around zoom back a bit zoom back a bit
and<00:02:49.340> just<00:02:50.340> on<00:02:50.459> the<00:02:50.580> side<00:02:50.970> here<00:02:51.360> you<00:02:51.600> see<00:02:51.959> don't

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
and just on the side here you see don't

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:53.479 
and just on the side here you see don't
let<00:02:52.260> it<00:02:52.410> sort<00:02:52.680> of<00:02:52.709> fold<00:02:52.950> down<00:02:53.069> there<00:02:53.250> but<00:02:53.370> just

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:53.489 
let it sort of fold down there but just

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:56.780 
let it sort of fold down there but just
on<00:02:53.580> the<00:02:53.670> side<00:02:53.880> here<00:02:54.060> you<00:02:54.480> can<00:02:54.660> release<00:02:55.670> just<00:02:56.670> a

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
on the side here you can release just a

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:57.949 
on the side here you can release just a
little<00:02:57.000> bit<00:02:57.120> there<00:02:57.510> release<00:02:57.720> the<00:02:57.840> pressure

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
little bit there release the pressure

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:00.890 
little bit there release the pressure
turn<00:02:58.860> that<00:02:58.980> around<00:02:59.330> and<00:03:00.330> there's<00:03:00.540> another<00:03:00.599> one

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
turn that around and there's another one

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.930 
turn that around and there's another one
that<00:03:00.959> appears<00:03:01.349> just<00:03:01.980> over<00:03:02.220> here<00:03:02.400> say<00:03:02.610> clean

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
that appears just over here say clean

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:05.059 
that appears just over here say clean
that<00:03:03.120> one<00:03:03.209> up<00:03:03.330> as<00:03:03.450> well<00:03:03.630> and<00:03:03.840> what<00:03:04.680> happens<00:03:04.950> is

00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:05.069 
that one up as well and what happens is

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:07.970 
that one up as well and what happens is
if<00:03:05.430> you<00:03:05.580> take<00:03:05.700> the<00:03:05.849> drum<00:03:06.060> out<00:03:06.200> you'll<00:03:07.200> see<00:03:07.290> that

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
if you take the drum out you'll see that

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:09.800 
if you take the drum out you'll see that
area<00:03:08.280> there<00:03:08.580> the<00:03:08.819> back<00:03:09.000> of<00:03:09.120> the<00:03:09.209> drum<00:03:09.420> will<00:03:09.720> be

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
area there the back of the drum will be

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.210 
area there the back of the drum will be
covered<00:03:10.049> in<00:03:10.110> Tanous<00:03:10.440> I<00:03:10.530> mean<00:03:10.680> you<00:03:10.739> won't<00:03:10.890> might

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
covered in Tanous I mean you won't might

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:12.650 
covered in Tanous I mean you won't might
want<00:03:11.370> to<00:03:11.400> pull<00:03:11.579> that<00:03:11.670> out<00:03:11.730> and<00:03:11.970> and<00:03:12.209> give<00:03:12.510> that

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
want to pull that out and and give that

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.509 
want to pull that out and and give that
a<00:03:12.690> bit<00:03:12.840> of<00:03:12.930> a<00:03:12.989> clean<00:03:13.200> off<00:03:13.350> as<00:03:13.470> well<00:03:13.620> and<00:03:13.890> that's

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:14.519 
a bit of a clean off as well and that's

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:15.890 
a bit of a clean off as well and that's
basically<00:03:14.850> that<00:03:15.090> should<00:03:15.359> get<00:03:15.450> your<00:03:15.600> machine

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
basically that should get your machine

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.199 
basically that should get your machine
up<00:03:16.019> and<00:03:16.079> running<00:03:16.200> again<00:03:16.560> and<00:03:16.820> then<00:03:17.820> basically

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
up and running again and then basically

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:20.330 
up and running again and then basically
put<00:03:18.480> it<00:03:18.570> back<00:03:18.690> in<00:03:18.840> reverse<00:03:19.079> order<00:03:19.290> okay<00:03:20.130> so<00:03:20.190> to

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
put it back in reverse order okay so to

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:21.680 
put it back in reverse order okay so to
pop<00:03:20.489> it<00:03:20.640> back<00:03:20.670> in<00:03:20.910> if<00:03:21.060> it<00:03:21.180> gets<00:03:21.329> a<00:03:21.390> little<00:03:21.480> bit

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
pop it back in if it gets a little bit

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:23.120 
pop it back in if it gets a little bit
stuck<00:03:21.989> at<00:03:22.350> that<00:03:22.500> end<00:03:22.650> when<00:03:22.739> you<00:03:22.799> go<00:03:22.890> to<00:03:22.950> push

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
stuck at that end when you go to push

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:25.309 
stuck at that end when you go to push
this<00:03:23.220> in<00:03:23.430> push<00:03:24.390> that<00:03:24.510> back<00:03:24.720> a<00:03:24.750> little<00:03:24.930> bit<00:03:25.109> just

00:03:25.309 --> 00:03:25.319 
this in push that back a little bit just

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:27.530 
this in push that back a little bit just
this<00:03:25.680> little<00:03:26.370> assembly<00:03:26.670> here<00:03:26.910> this<00:03:27.120> blade

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
this little assembly here this blade

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.599 
this little assembly here this blade
push<00:03:28.140> that<00:03:28.290> back<00:03:28.440> in<00:03:28.650> and<00:03:28.920> it<00:03:29.040> pushes<00:03:29.220> it<00:03:29.430> past

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:29.609 
push that back in and it pushes it past

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:31.550 
push that back in and it pushes it past
the<00:03:29.790> cam<00:03:30.000> and<00:03:30.180> it'll<00:03:30.420> slide<00:03:30.900> and<00:03:31.079> easily<00:03:31.319> don't

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
the cam and it'll slide and easily don't

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.229 
the cam and it'll slide and easily don't
force<00:03:31.799> anything<00:03:32.100> you<00:03:32.819> have<00:03:32.910> to<00:03:33.030> force

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:33.239 
force anything you have to force

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
anything you're doing it wrong and

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:37.729 
anything you're doing it wrong and
you'll<00:03:34.350> break<00:03:34.470> something<00:03:34.670> again<00:03:35.670> and<00:03:36.739> you

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:37.739 
you'll break something again and you

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:39.080 
you'll break something again and you
don't<00:03:37.920> put<00:03:38.130> all<00:03:38.220> the<00:03:38.250> screws<00:03:38.370> back<00:03:38.639> in<00:03:38.850> and

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
don't put all the screws back in and

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:42.920 
don't put all the screws back in and
that<00:03:39.450> should<00:03:39.600> be<00:03:39.660> sorted<00:03:39.989> alright<00:03:40.440> so<00:03:40.799> yeah
