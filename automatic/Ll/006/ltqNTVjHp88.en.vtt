00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:03.600
 two 

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:15.570
 hello everyone and welcome to vieri 

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:17.310
 tomorrow I will be doing a 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.680
 series of videos regarding the process of 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.240
 how to apply makeup step by step 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.619
 name of this video is the step of what 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.180
 that we are right now but if 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.279
 you want to see the full list you can 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.320
 click on this link in another way 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:31.289
 we continue now let's apply 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:35.340
 our blog and I'm going to use this brush 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:36.989
 of elf is the complexion brass and 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.699
 you definitely want the brush 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.580
 with which I applied it is thus great and 

00:00:38.699 --> 00:00:44.430
 be a vital sponge because you do not want 

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:46.500
 to see something very definite something like that 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.150
 little one like this if they realize 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.519
 the difference this is going to make it look 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:53.129
 pretty definite and maybe if you get 

00:00:50.519 --> 00:00:55.589
 brush if you have left a marked 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.269
 side and with a larger brush 

00:00:55.589 --> 00:00:59.549
 obviously you are going to prevent that 

00:00:57.269 --> 00:01:01.760
 happen and what we're going to do is give it 

00:00:59.549 --> 00:01:03.289
 touches of the blog 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:06.190
 always always always always 

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:08.230
 remember that you have to be 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:10.150
 always always because you do not say that 

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:13.360
 As I said, you do not want it to stay that way 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:15.880
 a brand of blogs like this completely 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:18.220
 obvious you always want your blog to look 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:20.170
 natural and if you still feel that you 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:22.600
 was a little bit you can also this 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:26.250
 remove the excess by patting 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.250
 towards the back of your hand 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:33.510
 and what you're going to do is that you're going to 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:37.080
 smile only to find what 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:39.030
 are your little apples leave your cheeks and 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:40.830
 if you still feel that still not the 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.140
 you can find use the handle of the 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:46.140
 brush and put it in half what it is to the 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.510
 half of your eye like that and from that half is 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:51.390
 where out is where you're going to want 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:53.940
 apply your plus you will not want 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.470
 apply it very close to your nose and the 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:57.330
 why I say that you smile is 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.250
 so you can find it easier 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:01.380
 but you do not want to do it either very 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:04.560
 down because then they'll see you 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.940
 this cheeks like falls and that's 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.760
 what does not want the purpose of 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:10.380
 makeup is always lifting your face and 

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:12.650
 Another way to know is by putting your finger 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:16.560
 index here in the apple of your cheek 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:20.540
 and taking your thumb to your 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:24.079
 ears to the edge of your ear and 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:25.879
 pull your index finger up and that 

00:02:24.079 --> 00:02:29.349
 line that I form is the one that wants to follow 

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:29.349
 to accentuate your class 

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:35.260
 so that 's how I'm going to do it 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:38.620
 and I'm going to apply it up 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.620
 Always up 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.870
 and I'm doing it with little taps for 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:47.990
 so that there is not a mark left in a single 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:47.990
 place 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:59.390
 and since I applied the amount I want 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:02.720
 then I'm going to this one like who says 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:05.140
 sweep or carry up with the 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:05.140
 brush 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:11.340
 and I do not know if they realize but I 'm not 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:14.280
 pressing I'm doing it right 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:18.620
 gentle because this way you're going to 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:18.620
 get the most natural look 

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:25.750
 and we're going to do the same thing on the other side 

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:39.520
 and that's how we end this step if 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:41.530
