prison if for no other reason than his
religious<00:01:33.030> beliefs<00:01:33.479> I<00:01:33.810> think<00:01:34.079> that<00:01:34.290> he<00:01:34.579> would

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
religious beliefs I think that he would

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:38.899 
religious beliefs I think that he would
have<00:01:35.850> would<00:01:36.689> have<00:01:36.720> opted<00:01:37.290> for<00:01:37.560> her<00:01:37.770> to<00:01:38.040> to<00:01:38.759> go

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
have would have opted for her to to go

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:39.710 
have would have opted for her to to go
to<00:01:38.970> the<00:01:39.090> death<00:01:39.270> chamber
