turtle<00:00:06.359> cliffs<00:00:06.799> these<00:00:07.799> are<00:00:08.010> really<00:00:08.580> cool

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210 
turtle cliffs these are really cool

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.950 
turtle cliffs these are really cool
and<00:00:09.300> I<00:00:10.610> was<00:00:11.610> meaning<00:00:12.059> to<00:00:12.090> do<00:00:12.269> a<00:00:12.300> video<00:00:12.660> on<00:00:12.809> these

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
and I was meaning to do a video on these

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.049 
and I was meaning to do a video on these
earlier<00:00:13.440> to<00:00:13.889> be<00:00:14.009> honest<00:00:14.309> with<00:00:14.400> you<00:00:14.580> but<00:00:14.849> then<00:00:15.030> I

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
earlier to be honest with you but then I

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:16.910 
earlier to be honest with you but then I
just<00:00:15.420> saw<00:00:15.660> them<00:00:15.960> I<00:00:16.049> was<00:00:16.080> just<00:00:16.350> at<00:00:16.470> the<00:00:16.560> global

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
just saw them I was just at the global

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.500 
just saw them I was just at the global
pet<00:00:17.100> expo<00:00:17.130> and<00:00:18.020> hagun<00:00:19.020> actually<00:00:19.529> had<00:00:19.859> these

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:20.510 
pet expo and hagun actually had these

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:23.840 
pet expo and hagun actually had these
inside<00:00:21.510> one<00:00:21.930> of<00:00:21.960> the<00:00:22.140> new<00:00:22.320> 36<00:00:23.039> inch<00:00:23.279> glass

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
inside one of the new 36 inch glass

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.910 
inside one of the new 36 inch glass
terrariums<00:00:24.720> right<00:00:24.990> they<00:00:25.170> had<00:00:25.350> two<00:00:25.650> of<00:00:25.800> them

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
terrariums right they had two of them

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.599 
terrariums right they had two of them
one<00:00:26.460> on<00:00:26.490> each<00:00:26.760> side<00:00:26.789> and<00:00:27.330> it<00:00:27.539> looked<00:00:28.019> amazing

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:28.609 
one on each side and it looked amazing

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:31.519 
one on each side and it looked amazing
so<00:00:29.609> the<00:00:29.760> purpose<00:00:30.300> of<00:00:30.480> these<00:00:30.689> turtle<00:00:31.170> clips<00:00:31.380> and

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
so the purpose of these turtle clips and

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.500 
so the purpose of these turtle clips and
the<00:00:31.920> thing<00:00:32.099> is<00:00:32.250> when<00:00:32.669> you're<00:00:32.759> just<00:00:33.059> looking<00:00:33.390> at

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
the thing is when you're just looking at

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.810 
the thing is when you're just looking at
them<00:00:33.630> on<00:00:33.719> a<00:00:34.200> picture<00:00:34.800> on<00:00:35.040> a<00:00:35.070> website<00:00:35.399> you're

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
them on a picture on a website you're

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.490 
them on a picture on a website you're
really<00:00:36.090> not<00:00:36.239> getting<00:00:36.719> what<00:00:36.989> these<00:00:37.170> are<00:00:37.350> all

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
really not getting what these are all

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.310 
really not getting what these are all
about<00:00:37.800> what<00:00:38.460> these<00:00:38.730> are<00:00:38.940> about<00:00:39.210> is<00:00:39.510> about<00:00:40.140> a

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
about what these are about is about a

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.190 
about what these are about is about a
waterfall<00:00:40.980> and<00:00:41.190> filtration<00:00:42.000> in<00:00:42.239> one<00:00:42.629> so

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
waterfall and filtration in one so

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.139 
waterfall and filtration in one so
you've<00:00:43.350> got<00:00:43.530> two<00:00:43.710> sizes<00:00:44.250> right<00:00:44.460> you've<00:00:44.910> got

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
you've got two sizes right you've got

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.889 
you've got two sizes right you've got
the<00:00:45.270> large<00:00:45.539> it's<00:00:45.870> fourteen<00:00:46.410> by<00:00:46.649> nine<00:00:46.920> by<00:00:47.190> nine

00:00:47.889 --> 00:00:47.899 
the large it's fourteen by nine by nine

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:50.420 
the large it's fourteen by nine by nine
approximately<00:00:48.899> and<00:00:49.170> this<00:00:49.200> one<00:00:49.890> is

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
approximately and this one is

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.180 
approximately and this one is
approximately<00:00:51.210> nine<00:00:51.449> by<00:00:51.719> seven<00:00:52.110> by<00:00:52.260> seven<00:00:52.770> so

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
approximately nine by seven by seven so

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.950 
approximately nine by seven by seven so
depending<00:00:53.640> the<00:00:53.699> area<00:00:54.030> want<00:00:54.300> to<00:00:54.390> put<00:00:54.600> them<00:00:54.780> in

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
depending the area want to put them in

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.110 
depending the area want to put them in
you're<00:00:55.770> probably<00:00:55.920> going<00:00:56.280> to<00:00:56.460> delegate<00:00:56.879> that

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
you're probably going to delegate that

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.490 
you're probably going to delegate that
into<00:00:57.660> into<00:00:58.020> that<00:00:58.199> so<00:00:58.680> um<00:00:59.010> the<00:00:59.609> smaller<00:01:00.000> one

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:00.500 
into into that so um the smaller one

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.529 
into into that so um the smaller one
just<00:01:01.500> that<00:01:01.649> you<00:01:01.739> see<00:01:01.949> is<00:01:02.190> really<00:01:02.940> a<00:01:02.969> corner

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
just that you see is really a corner

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.600 
just that you see is really a corner
design<00:01:03.750> model<00:01:04.290> this<00:01:04.619> is<00:01:04.799> going<00:01:05.040> to<00:01:05.100> get<00:01:05.220> stuck

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
design model this is going to get stuck

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.020 
design model this is going to get stuck
into<00:01:05.820> a<00:01:06.000> corner<00:01:06.570> and<00:01:06.720> the<00:01:07.710> water<00:01:08.400> basically

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
into a corner and the water basically

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.250 
into a corner and the water basically
comes<00:01:09.810> out<00:01:10.080> of<00:01:10.290> here<00:01:10.619> and<00:01:11.330> inside<00:01:12.330> here<00:01:12.780> is<00:01:12.930> the

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
comes out of here and inside here is the

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:18.109 
comes out of here and inside here is the
filter<00:01:13.920> now<00:01:14.280> that's<00:01:14.490> an<00:01:14.640> rs250<00:01:17.119> internal

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
filter now that's an rs250 internal

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.840 
filter now that's an rs250 internal
filter<00:01:18.570> that<00:01:18.990> will<00:01:19.140> do<00:01:19.259> 66<00:01:19.890> gallons<00:01:20.100> per<00:01:20.490> hours

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
filter that will do 66 gallons per hours

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.760 
filter that will do 66 gallons per hours
so<00:01:20.970> it's<00:01:21.119> actually<00:01:21.299> quite<00:01:21.750> a<00:01:21.780> good<00:01:21.900> filtration

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
so it's actually quite a good filtration

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.399 
so it's actually quite a good filtration
so<00:01:23.250> it's<00:01:23.549> really<00:01:24.030> neat<00:01:24.240> because<00:01:24.270> this<00:01:25.080> whole

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
so it's really neat because this whole

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.700 
so it's really neat because this whole
unit<00:01:25.920> sits<00:01:26.580> in<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:27.330> water<00:01:27.630> so<00:01:28.200> the<00:01:28.320> water<00:01:28.350> is

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
unit sits in the water so the water is

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.800 
unit sits in the water so the water is
going<00:01:28.770> to<00:01:28.920> come<00:01:29.159> up<00:01:29.280> maybe<00:01:29.490> here<00:01:30.030> right<00:01:30.540> and

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
going to come up maybe here right and

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.679 
going to come up maybe here right and
the<00:01:31.439> water<00:01:31.680> is<00:01:31.950> going<00:01:32.310> to<00:01:32.369> spill<00:01:32.970> out<00:01:33.210> of<00:01:33.420> here

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
the water is going to spill out of here

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.179 
the water is going to spill out of here
so<00:01:33.869> you've<00:01:34.020> got<00:01:34.200> that<00:01:34.380> whole<00:01:34.439> waterfall

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
so you've got that whole waterfall

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.670 
so you've got that whole waterfall
effect<00:01:35.280> but<00:01:35.670> it's<00:01:35.790> actually<00:01:36.329> a<00:01:36.390> filter<00:01:36.869> too<00:01:37.140> so

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
effect but it's actually a filter too so

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.190 
effect but it's actually a filter too so
that's<00:01:37.920> great<00:01:38.159> and<00:01:38.729> then<00:01:39.180> this<00:01:39.570> unit<00:01:40.020> the

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
that's great and then this unit the

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.230 
that's great and then this unit the
larger<00:01:40.590> unit<00:01:40.860> this<00:01:41.310> can<00:01:41.520> be<00:01:41.640> put<00:01:41.850> anywhere

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
larger unit this can be put anywhere

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.359 
larger unit this can be put anywhere
because<00:01:42.720> it's<00:01:43.020> meant<00:01:43.290> not<00:01:43.649> necessarily<00:01:44.159> to<00:01:44.250> go

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
because it's meant not necessarily to go

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:45.980 
because it's meant not necessarily to go
into<00:01:44.610> a<00:01:44.640> corner<00:01:44.970> it's<00:01:45.090> meant<00:01:45.270> to<00:01:45.329> go<00:01:45.540> any<00:01:45.750> way

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
into a corner it's meant to go any way

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.289 
into a corner it's meant to go any way
you<00:01:46.380> want<00:01:46.619> to<00:01:46.740> go<00:01:46.890> obviously<00:01:47.700> back<00:01:47.939> to<00:01:48.210> the

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
you want to go obviously back to the

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.289 
you want to go obviously back to the
back<00:01:48.479> wall<00:01:48.979> but<00:01:49.979> again<00:01:50.250> a<00:01:50.490> lot<00:01:50.520> of<00:01:50.820> water<00:01:51.060> will

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
back wall but again a lot of water will

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:55.160 
back wall but again a lot of water will
spill<00:01:51.720> out<00:01:51.750> of<00:01:52.020> here<00:01:52.380> it's<00:01:52.590> almost<00:01:53.130> like<00:01:54.170> water

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
spill out of here it's almost like water

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.440 
spill out of here it's almost like water
going<00:01:55.290> over<00:01:55.950> a<00:01:55.979> cliff<00:01:56.250> it's<00:01:56.820> got<00:01:57.090> a<00:01:57.119> really

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
going over a cliff it's got a really

going over a cliff it's got a really
cool<00:01:57.750> effect<00:01:57.930> in<00:01:58.350> some<00:01:58.680> ways<00:01:58.829> I<00:01:58.920> wish<00:01:59.040> I<00:01:59.189> had<00:01:59.820> an

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
cool effect in some ways I wish I had an

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.330 
cool effect in some ways I wish I had an
aquarium<00:02:00.479> here<00:02:00.780> and<00:02:00.990> was<00:02:01.619> showing<00:02:01.890> you<00:02:02.100> how<00:02:02.280> it

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
aquarium here and was showing you how it

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.660 
aquarium here and was showing you how it
worked<00:02:02.610> but<00:02:03.119> trust<00:02:03.509> me<00:02:03.750> it<00:02:03.990> really<00:02:04.950> really

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
worked but trust me it really really

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.080 
worked but trust me it really really
looks<00:02:05.909> neat<00:02:06.210> and<00:02:06.390> has<00:02:06.960> a<00:02:06.990> great<00:02:07.590> purpose<00:02:08.190> the

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
looks neat and has a great purpose the

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:10.990 
looks neat and has a great purpose the
filtration<00:02:09.629> inside<00:02:10.229> this<00:02:10.500> one

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
filtration inside this one

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.230 
filtration inside this one
kind<00:02:11.330> of<00:02:11.420> thing<00:02:11.980> the<00:02:12.980> filtration<00:02:13.550> inside<00:02:14.060> this

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:14.240 
kind of thing the filtration inside this

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:18.190 
kind of thing the filtration inside this
one<00:02:14.450> is<00:02:15.220> 92<00:02:16.220> gallons<00:02:16.820> per<00:02:17.000> hour<00:02:17.060> so<00:02:17.510> also<00:02:17.990> a

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
one is 92 gallons per hour so also a

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.770 
one is 92 gallons per hour so also a
very<00:02:18.650> good<00:02:18.860> filtration<00:02:19.520> system<00:02:19.940> and<00:02:20.120> both<00:02:20.720> of

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
very good filtration system and both of

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.470 
very good filtration system and both of
these<00:02:21.050> are<00:02:21.110> three-stage<00:02:21.800> filters<00:02:22.480> biological

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
these are three-stage filters biological

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:26.710 
these are three-stage filters biological
chemical<00:02:24.140> and<00:02:24.440> mechanical<00:02:24.830> filtration<00:02:25.700> so<00:02:26.390> if

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 
chemical and mechanical filtration so if

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.800 
chemical and mechanical filtration so if
you<00:02:27.260> have<00:02:27.530> a<00:02:27.560> turtle<00:02:28.070> setup<00:02:28.880> these<00:02:29.180> are<00:02:29.390> great

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
you have a turtle setup these are great

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:32.820 
you have a turtle setup these are great
but<00:02:30.500> even<00:02:30.920> if<00:02:31.010> you<00:02:31.130> have<00:02:31.459> a<00:02:31.790> part<00:02:32.390> water
