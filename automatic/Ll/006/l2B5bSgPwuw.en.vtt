00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
that was another forty bucks so I just

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:05.270 
that was another forty bucks so I just
had<00:02:01.439> my<00:02:01.619> girlfriend<00:02:03.229> put<00:02:04.229> her<00:02:04.290> shoes<00:02:04.320> on<00:02:04.799> step

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.010 
had my girlfriend put her shoes on step
on<00:02:05.430> the<00:02:05.610> thing<00:02:05.850> and<00:02:06.030> then<00:02:06.210> I<00:02:06.299> drilled<00:02:06.630> and<00:02:06.840> that

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
on the thing and then I drilled and that

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.230 
on the thing and then I drilled and that
seemed<00:02:07.290> to<00:02:07.439> work<00:02:07.530> pretty<00:02:07.590> well

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:09.240 
seemed to work pretty well

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:12.930 
seemed to work pretty well
you<00:02:10.240> don't<00:02:10.480> really<00:02:10.840> need<00:02:11.200> super<00:02:11.950> crazy<00:02:12.310> exact

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:14.880 
you don't really need super crazy exact
tools<00:02:13.330> but<00:02:13.690> you<00:02:13.720> know<00:02:13.990> whatever<00:02:14.290> you<00:02:14.620> should

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
tools but you know whatever you should

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:16.440 
tools but you know whatever you should
but<00:02:15.250> I<00:02:15.280> don't<00:02:15.760> think<00:02:15.940> it's<00:02:16.090> gonna<00:02:16.240> be<00:02:16.420> a

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
but I don't think it's gonna be a

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:17.100 
but I don't think it's gonna be a
problem

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110

so anyway from here I'm gonna glue you

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.220 
so anyway from here I'm gonna glue you
know<00:02:19.870> put<00:02:20.170> glue<00:02:20.410> on<00:02:20.650> all<00:02:21.220> the<00:02:21.400> joints<00:02:22.080> put<00:02:23.080> in

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
know put glue on all the joints put in

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:29.430 
know put glue on all the joints put in
some<00:02:23.650> of<00:02:24.960> these<00:02:27.210> self-tapping<00:02:28.210> pocket<00:02:29.170> holes

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
some of these self-tapping pocket holes

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:35.240 
some of these self-tapping pocket holes
these<00:02:30.310> this<00:02:30.670> pack<00:02:30.970> was<00:02:31.180> about<00:02:31.480> five<00:02:31.950> 556<00:02:32.950> bucks

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
these this pack was about five 556 bucks

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.540 
these this pack was about five 556 bucks
so<00:02:36.250> all<00:02:36.460> in<00:02:36.610> all<00:02:36.730> materials<00:02:37.480> were<00:02:37.720> looking<00:02:38.140> at

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
so all in all materials were looking at

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:42.930 
so all in all materials were looking at
I<00:02:39.550> don't<00:02:40.180> know<00:02:40.560> what's<00:02:41.560> that<00:02:41.800> eighteen<00:02:42.520> twenty

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940 
I don't know what's that eighteen twenty

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:45.420 
I don't know what's that eighteen twenty
dollars<00:02:43.330> after-tax<00:02:43.900> so<00:02:44.320> not<00:02:44.860> a<00:02:44.890> bad<00:02:45.130> thing<00:02:45.370> you

dollars after-tax so not a bad thing you

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.870 
dollars after-tax so not a bad thing you
know

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 
know

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:47.730 
know
the<00:02:46.030> pocket<00:02:46.450> hole<00:02:46.630> jig<00:02:46.660> cost<00:02:47.200> a<00:02:47.350> little<00:02:47.500> money

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:47.740 
the pocket hole jig cost a little money

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:51.030 
the pocket hole jig cost a little money
but<00:02:48.040> I<00:02:48.610> can<00:02:49.300> use<00:02:49.480> that<00:02:49.510> for<00:02:49.930> future<00:02:50.110> stuff<00:02:50.620> I'll

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
but I can use that for future stuff I'll

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.610 
but I can use that for future stuff I'll
be<00:02:51.220> using<00:02:51.460> it<00:02:51.730> for<00:02:52.000> the<00:02:52.150> hood<00:02:52.750> as<00:02:52.990> well<00:02:53.200> I<00:02:53.470> just

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
be using it for the hood as well I just

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:57.330 
be using it for the hood as well I just
wanted<00:02:54.070> to<00:02:54.220> show<00:02:54.460> the<00:02:54.930> the<00:02:55.930> frame<00:02:56.320> next<00:02:56.980> to<00:02:57.250> the

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
wanted to show the the frame next to the

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:00.960 
wanted to show the the frame next to the
tank<00:02:57.690> of<00:02:58.690> course<00:02:59.020> it's<00:02:59.230> a<00:02:59.320> little<00:02:59.500> bit<00:02:59.970> taller

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970 
tank of course it's a little bit taller

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:03.810 
tank of course it's a little bit taller
if<00:03:01.900> I<00:03:02.050> can<00:03:02.980> get<00:03:03.130> an<00:03:03.220> angle<00:03:03.520> there<00:03:03.670> it's<00:03:03.790> a

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:03.820 
if I can get an angle there it's a

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:05.550 
if I can get an angle there it's a
little<00:03:03.940> bit<00:03:04.180> taller<00:03:04.420> when<00:03:04.840> it's<00:03:05.050> when<00:03:05.470> the

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
little bit taller when it's when the

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.490 
little bit taller when it's when the
tanks<00:03:05.890> actually<00:03:06.220> sitting<00:03:06.490> on<00:03:06.730> it<00:03:06.990> the<00:03:07.990> entire

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:08.500 
tanks actually sitting on it the entire

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.140 
tanks actually sitting on it the entire
frame<00:03:08.860> is<00:03:08.980> gonna<00:03:09.130> be<00:03:09.220> on<00:03:09.520> it<00:03:09.700> and<00:03:09.790> then<00:03:09.970> the

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150 
frame is gonna be on it and then the

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:14.970 
frame is gonna be on it and then the
extra<00:03:10.570> wood<00:03:10.750> is<00:03:10.900> going<00:03:11.230> to<00:03:11.410> allow<00:03:11.710> for<00:03:12.300> a<00:03:13.980> bit

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:14.980 
extra wood is going to allow for a bit

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:17.730 
extra wood is going to allow for a bit
of<00:03:15.130> a<00:03:15.220> lip<00:03:15.460> so<00:03:16.330> that's<00:03:16.630> nice<00:03:16.960> I'm<00:03:17.290> happy<00:03:17.710> that

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:17.740 
of a lip so that's nice I'm happy that

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:21.930 
of a lip so that's nice I'm happy that
the<00:03:19.500> everything<00:03:20.500> worked<00:03:20.890> out<00:03:21.160> the<00:03:21.460> way<00:03:21.490> the

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 
the everything worked out the way the

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:24.900 
the everything worked out the way the
calculator<00:03:22.600> the<00:03:23.380> online<00:03:23.710> calculator<00:03:24.010> kind<00:03:24.820> of

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:24.910 
calculator the online calculator kind of

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:27.690 
calculator the online calculator kind of
predicted<00:03:25.480> it<00:03:25.570> would<00:03:26.070> here's<00:03:27.070> how<00:03:27.280> this<00:03:27.520> is<00:03:27.580> a

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:27.700 
predicted it would here's how this is a

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:29.850 
predicted it would here's how this is a
better<00:03:27.940> shot<00:03:28.270> there's<00:03:28.810> how<00:03:28.990> the<00:03:29.050> pocket<00:03:29.620> holes

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:29.860 
better shot there's how the pocket holes

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:33.540 
better shot there's how the pocket holes
are<00:03:30.100> working<00:03:30.750> and<00:03:31.750> then<00:03:32.050> there's<00:03:32.290> glue<00:03:32.620> on<00:03:33.400> all

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:33.550 
are working and then there's glue on all

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:37.850 
are working and then there's glue on all
those<00:03:33.730> joints<00:03:34.120> so<00:03:34.510> it's<00:03:34.690> just<00:03:34.930> a<00:03:35.080> simple<00:03:35.440> frame

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:37.860 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:40.590 

should<00:03:38.860> be<00:03:39.070> should<00:03:39.490> work<00:03:39.670> out<00:03:39.880> pretty<00:03:40.060> well

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:40.600 
should be should work out pretty well

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:42.270 
should be should work out pretty well
so<00:03:40.870> I<00:03:40.900> got<00:03:41.200> another<00:03:41.410> one<00:03:41.650> of<00:03:41.710> these<00:03:41.890> to<00:03:42.130> make

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:42.280 
so I got another one of these to make

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:45.180 
so I got another one of these to make
I'm<00:03:42.880> going<00:03:43.510> to<00:03:43.830> excuse<00:03:44.830> me<00:03:44.980> I'm<00:03:45.100> gonna

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:45.190 
I'm going to excuse me I'm gonna

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:48.900 
I'm going to excuse me I'm gonna
reinforce<00:03:46.290> I<00:03:47.290> didn't<00:03:47.920> want<00:03:48.070> to<00:03:48.190> reinforce<00:03:48.430> it

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:48.910 
reinforce I didn't want to reinforce it

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:51.870 
reinforce I didn't want to reinforce it
yet<00:03:49.240> because<00:03:50.110> there's<00:03:50.380> gonna<00:03:50.530> be<00:03:50.590> a<00:03:50.980> bar<00:03:51.310> or<00:03:51.820> a

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:51.880 
yet because there's gonna be a bar or a

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:54.540 
yet because there's gonna be a bar or a
piece<00:03:52.540> of<00:03:52.570> wood<00:03:52.750> going<00:03:53.230> here<00:03:53.650> and<00:03:53.800> then<00:03:54.520> a

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:54.550 
piece of wood going here and then a

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:56.160 
piece of wood going here and then a
piece<00:03:54.790> of<00:03:54.820> wood<00:03:55.060> going<00:03:55.300> here<00:03:55.690> I<00:03:55.720> want<00:03:56.110> to

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:56.170 
piece of wood going here I want to

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:00.240 
piece of wood going here I want to
measure<00:03:56.410> it<00:03:57.120> so<00:03:58.120> that<00:03:58.330> it's<00:03:58.450> not<00:03:58.660> blocking<00:03:59.250> any

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:00.250 
measure it so that it's not blocking any

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:02.790 
measure it so that it's not blocking any
of<00:04:00.400> the<00:04:00.790> of<00:04:01.180> the<00:04:01.420> plumbing<00:04:01.840> obviously<00:04:02.530> so

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:02.800 
of the of the plumbing obviously so

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:05.220 
of the of the plumbing obviously so
here's<00:04:03.100> a<00:04:03.190> base<00:04:03.490> I've<00:04:03.850> I<00:04:04.210> made<00:04:04.600> both<00:04:04.870> of<00:04:04.900> them

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:05.230 
here's a base I've I made both of them

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:07.440 
here's a base I've I made both of them
they're<00:04:05.440> both<00:04:05.590> symmetrical<00:04:06.370> one's<00:04:06.910> gonna<00:04:07.120> be

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:07.450 
they're both symmetrical one's gonna be

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:10.440 
they're both symmetrical one's gonna be
on<00:04:07.720> the<00:04:08.050> floor<00:04:08.760> and<00:04:09.760> then<00:04:09.940> this<00:04:10.120> one's<00:04:10.360> going

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:10.450 
on the floor and then this one's going

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:14.490 
on the floor and then this one's going
to<00:04:10.630> be<00:04:10.780> directly<00:04:11.260> under<00:04:11.860> the<00:04:12.160> tank<00:04:13.140> as<00:04:14.140> you<00:04:14.320> can

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:14.500 
to be directly under the tank as you can

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:16.950 
to be directly under the tank as you can
see<00:04:14.800> I<00:04:14.830> measured<00:04:15.430> out<00:04:15.550> so<00:04:16.120> the<00:04:16.270> holes<00:04:16.510> again

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:16.960 
see I measured out so the holes again

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:18.319 
see I measured out so the holes again
that<00:04:17.260> it's

00:04:18.319 --> 00:04:18.329 
that it's

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:21.249 
that it's
not<00:04:18.720> lined<00:04:19.019> up<00:04:19.169> perfectly<00:04:19.769> the<00:04:20.009> way<00:04:20.039> it's

00:04:21.249 --> 00:04:21.259 
not lined up perfectly the way it's

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:25.490 
not lined up perfectly the way it's
finally<00:04:22.259> going<00:04:22.590> to<00:04:22.770> look<00:04:23.240> but<00:04:24.240> the<00:04:24.389> holes<00:04:24.629> work

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:25.500 
finally going to look but the holes work

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:27.770 
finally going to look but the holes work
out<00:04:25.830> very<00:04:26.129> well<00:04:26.520> for<00:04:27.000> the<00:04:27.090> plumbing<00:04:27.360> so

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:27.780 
out very well for the plumbing so

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:30.050 
out very well for the plumbing so
whether<00:04:27.990> I<00:04:28.110> decide<00:04:28.740> to<00:04:28.770> use<00:04:28.979> it<00:04:29.159> or<00:04:29.400> not<00:04:29.460> you

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:30.060 
whether I decide to use it or not you

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:31.580 
whether I decide to use it or not you
know<00:04:30.180> obviously<00:04:30.659> I'll<00:04:30.810> still<00:04:31.050> need<00:04:31.229> to<00:04:31.349> plug

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:31.590 
know obviously I'll still need to plug

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:34.490 
know obviously I'll still need to plug
it<00:04:31.740> if<00:04:31.830> I<00:04:31.979> decide<00:04:32.310> not<00:04:32.340> to<00:04:32.580> use<00:04:32.970> it<00:04:33.259> that<00:04:34.259> way<00:04:34.289> I

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:34.500 
it if I decide not to use it that way I

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:38.119 
it if I decide not to use it that way I
have<00:04:34.800> access<00:04:35.370> and<00:04:35.699> I<00:04:36.030> won't<00:04:36.360> have<00:04:36.629> to<00:04:37.129> drill

00:04:38.119 --> 00:04:38.129 
have access and I won't have to drill

00:04:38.129 --> 00:04:44.059 
have access and I won't have to drill
into<00:04:38.400> the<00:04:40.699> you<00:04:41.699> know<00:04:41.729> into<00:04:42.000> the<00:04:42.300> wood<00:04:43.069> these

00:04:44.059 --> 00:04:44.069 
into the you know into the wood these

00:04:44.069 --> 00:04:49.430 
into the you know into the wood these
this<00:04:44.729> bar<00:04:45.479> here<00:04:46.020> and<00:04:46.169> this<00:04:47.009> bar<00:04:47.310> here<00:04:48.440> wasn't

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:49.440 
this bar here and this bar here wasn't

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:53.360 
this bar here and this bar here wasn't
in<00:04:49.830> the<00:04:50.370> the<00:04:50.849> build<00:04:51.210> the<00:04:52.139> you<00:04:52.710> know<00:04:52.800> the<00:04:52.979> builds

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:53.370 
in the the build the you know the builds

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:57.649 
in the the build the you know the builds
that<00:04:53.539> that<00:04:54.539> I<00:04:54.569> saw<00:04:55.580> on<00:04:56.580> that<00:04:57.120> automatic

00:04:57.649 --> 00:04:57.659 
that that I saw on that automatic

00:04:57.659 --> 00:05:00.740 
that that I saw on that automatic
builder<00:04:58.080> I<00:04:58.110> was<00:04:58.379> talking<00:04:58.800> about<00:04:59.389> however<00:05:00.389> I

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:00.750 
builder I was talking about however I

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:03.110 
builder I was talking about however I
went<00:05:01.199> and<00:05:01.379> I<00:05:01.560> decided<00:05:02.219> I<00:05:02.400> wanted<00:05:02.699> a<00:05:02.819> little<00:05:02.940> bit

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:03.120 
went and I decided I wanted a little bit

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:05.270 
went and I decided I wanted a little bit
more<00:05:03.240> structural<00:05:04.020> so<00:05:04.139> you're<00:05:04.289> looking<00:05:04.440> at<00:05:04.889> the

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:05.280 
more structural so you're looking at the

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:10.520 
more structural so you're looking at the
the<00:05:06.000> Garf<00:05:06.770> a<00:05:08.389> calculator<00:05:09.389> that's<00:05:10.110> that's

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:10.530 
the Garf a calculator that's that's

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:12.350 
the Garf a calculator that's that's
really<00:05:10.830> the<00:05:10.949> only<00:05:10.979> modification<00:05:11.550> that<00:05:12.240> I've

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:12.360 
really the only modification that I've

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:15.800 
really the only modification that I've
made<00:05:12.659> to<00:05:12.719> it<00:05:13.250> at<00:05:14.250> this<00:05:14.490> time<00:05:14.849> when<00:05:15.330> I<00:05:15.360> put<00:05:15.659> the

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:15.810 
made to it at this time when I put the

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:17.869 
made to it at this time when I put the
facade<00:05:15.990> on<00:05:16.440> I<00:05:16.469> might<00:05:16.889> you<00:05:17.099> know<00:05:17.129> for<00:05:17.490> the<00:05:17.580> trim

00:05:17.869 --> 00:05:17.879 
facade on I might you know for the trim

00:05:17.879 --> 00:05:19.550 
facade on I might you know for the trim
or<00:05:18.180> something<00:05:18.629> like<00:05:18.750> that<00:05:18.810> I<00:05:19.020> might<00:05:19.319> make

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:19.560 
or something like that I might make

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:22.700 
or something like that I might make
other<00:05:19.830> modifications<00:05:21.020> so<00:05:22.020> here<00:05:22.229> it<00:05:22.319> is<00:05:22.440> I'll

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:22.710 
other modifications so here it is I'll

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:29.689 
other modifications so here it is I'll
put<00:05:22.919> together<00:05:27.229> actually<00:05:28.229> can't<00:05:28.889> reach<00:05:29.400> from

00:05:29.689 --> 00:05:29.699 
put together actually can't reach from

00:05:29.699 --> 00:05:32.330 
put together actually can't reach from
the<00:05:29.880> top<00:05:30.090> to<00:05:30.479> the<00:05:30.840> bottom<00:05:30.990> of<00:05:31.229> the<00:05:31.440> tank<00:05:31.620> so<00:05:32.099> I

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:32.340 
the top to the bottom of the tank so I

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:34.189 
the top to the bottom of the tank so I
didn't<00:05:32.639> want<00:05:32.819> to<00:05:32.880> drop<00:05:33.090> it<00:05:33.270> in<00:05:33.389> there<00:05:33.599> and<00:05:33.630> I'll

00:05:34.189 --> 00:05:34.199 
didn't want to drop it in there and I'll

00:05:34.199 --> 00:05:37.339 
didn't want to drop it in there and I'll
be<00:05:34.380> able<00:05:34.529> to<00:05:34.620> fish<00:05:34.830> it<00:05:34.979> out<00:05:35.960> there's<00:05:36.960> a<00:05:37.050> little

00:05:37.339 --> 00:05:37.349 
be able to fish it out there's a little

00:05:37.349 --> 00:05:40.339 
be able to fish it out there's a little
bit<00:05:37.529> of<00:05:37.740> space<00:05:38.580> here<00:05:38.610> this<00:05:39.210> is<00:05:39.419> everything<00:05:40.020> was

00:05:40.339 --> 00:05:40.349 
bit of space here this is everything was

00:05:40.349 --> 00:05:44.450 
bit of space here this is everything was
just<00:05:40.560> screwed<00:05:40.979> in<00:05:41.130> and<00:05:41.490> just<00:05:41.909> glued<00:05:42.210> so<00:05:43.460> right

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:44.460 
just screwed in and just glued so right

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:55.080 
just screwed in and just glued so right
now<00:05:44.699> I<00:05:46.219> have<00:05:47.219> it<00:05:47.430> kinda<00:05:48.300> even<00:05:48.750> so<00:05:49.650> that<00:05:49.889> it<00:05:50.039> can

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:55.090 

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:57.960 

press<00:05:55.750> down<00:05:56.020> equally<00:05:56.740> on<00:05:56.950> all<00:05:57.160> the<00:05:57.310> joints<00:05:57.550> all

00:05:57.960 --> 00:05:57.970 
press down equally on all the joints all

00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:01.710 
press down equally on all the joints all
the<00:05:58.150> parts<00:05:58.570> that<00:05:58.660> are<00:05:58.900> glued<00:05:59.640> but<00:06:00.720> what's

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:01.720 
the parts that are glued but what's

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:04.530 
the parts that are glued but what's
gonna<00:06:01.960> happen<00:06:02.410> is<00:06:02.560> this<00:06:02.800> is<00:06:02.980> gonna<00:06:03.190> be<00:06:03.540> brought

to<00:06:04.810> the<00:06:04.930> front<00:06:05.110> all<00:06:05.410> the<00:06:05.590> way<00:06:05.710> here<00:06:05.950> so<00:06:06.190> it's

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:06.310 
to the front all the way here so it's

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:08.100 
to the front all the way here so it's
gonna<00:06:06.430> be<00:06:06.610> flush<00:06:06.910> I'm<00:06:07.210> gonna<00:06:07.420> put<00:06:07.630> some<00:06:07.840> trim

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:08.110 
gonna be flush I'm gonna put some trim

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:09.690 
gonna be flush I'm gonna put some trim
and<00:06:08.320> stuff<00:06:08.560> on<00:06:08.770> it<00:06:08.800> that's<00:06:09.160> gonna<00:06:09.340> be<00:06:09.550> in<00:06:09.610> a

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:09.700 
and stuff on it that's gonna be in a

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:11.640 
and stuff on it that's gonna be in a
whole<00:06:09.850> other<00:06:10.060> video<00:06:10.300> series<00:06:10.900> because<00:06:11.200> this<00:06:11.500> is

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:11.650 
whole other video series because this is

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:15.000 
whole other video series because this is
already<00:06:11.830> getting<00:06:12.120> incredibly<00:06:13.120> long<00:06:13.770> and<00:06:14.770> then

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:15.010 
already getting incredibly long and then

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:18.330 
already getting incredibly long and then
the<00:06:15.190> back<00:06:15.430> here<00:06:15.970> she's<00:06:16.900> got<00:06:17.110> some<00:06:17.350> straight

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:18.340 
the back here she's got some straight

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:19.830 
the back here she's got some straight
glue<00:06:18.580> and<00:06:18.760> stuff<00:06:18.970> the<00:06:19.180> back<00:06:19.360> here<00:06:19.630> is<00:06:19.720> gonna

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:19.840 
glue and stuff the back here is gonna

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:22.170 
glue and stuff the back here is gonna
have<00:06:20.140> almost<00:06:20.650> the<00:06:20.920> entire<00:06:21.250> length<00:06:21.550> to<00:06:21.790> this<00:06:21.910> -

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:22.180 
have almost the entire length to this -

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:23.820 
have almost the entire length to this -
but<00:06:22.390> well<00:06:22.600> it<00:06:22.810> is<00:06:22.930> gonna<00:06:23.110> have<00:06:23.350> the<00:06:23.530> entire

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:23.830 
but well it is gonna have the entire

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:26.880 
but well it is gonna have the entire
length<00:06:24.040> this<00:06:24.340> 2x4<00:06:24.760> free<00:06:25.270> and<00:06:25.810> so<00:06:26.410> I'm<00:06:26.530> gonna<00:06:26.680> be

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:26.890 
length this 2x4 free and so I'm gonna be

00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:31.460 
length this 2x4 free and so I'm gonna be
able<00:06:26.950> to<00:06:27.130> put<00:06:27.490> people<00:06:29.070> use<00:06:30.070> this<00:06:30.250> like<00:06:30.490> DJ

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:31.470 
able to put people use this like DJ

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:34.200 
able to put people use this like DJ
electrical<00:06:32.470> strip<00:06:32.800> that<00:06:33.070> they<00:06:33.640> seem<00:06:33.880> to<00:06:34.060> like

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:34.210 
electrical strip that they seem to like

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:36.420 
electrical strip that they seem to like
so<00:06:35.110> that's<00:06:35.290> probably<00:06:35.590> something<00:06:35.980> that<00:06:36.310> I'm

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:36.430 
so that's probably something that I'm

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:37.950 
so that's probably something that I'm
gonna<00:06:36.580> use<00:06:36.880> and<00:06:37.090> then<00:06:37.180> I<00:06:37.240> can<00:06:37.450> drill<00:06:37.750> that

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:37.960 
gonna use and then I can drill that

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:40.650 
gonna use and then I can drill that
right<00:06:38.620> into<00:06:38.980> the<00:06:39.100> wood<00:06:39.280> it's<00:06:39.970> gonna<00:06:40.180> be<00:06:40.390> solid

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:40.660 
right into the wood it's gonna be solid
