shell of the helmet there's a space that

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.360 
shell of the helmet there's a space that
goes<00:00:51.660> in<00:00:51.840> about<00:00:51.989> half<00:00:52.230> an<00:00:52.379> inch<00:00:52.500> that<00:00:52.829> is<00:00:52.890> very

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
goes in about half an inch that is very

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.029 
goes in about half an inch that is very
good<00:00:53.670> for<00:00:54.059> this<00:00:54.329> purpose<00:00:54.780> to<00:00:54.809> hold<00:00:55.620> stuff<00:00:55.860> in

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
good for this purpose to hold stuff in

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.849 
good for this purpose to hold stuff in
it<00:00:56.190> and<00:00:56.280> then<00:00:56.510> the<00:00:57.510> bottom<00:00:57.989> was<00:00:58.379> kind<00:00:58.620> of<00:00:58.710> just

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
it and then the bottom was kind of just

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.470 
it and then the bottom was kind of just
held<00:00:59.039> in<00:00:59.190> place<00:00:59.309> just<00:00:59.430> by<00:00:59.820> the<00:00:59.879> way<00:01:00.059> that<00:01:00.329> the

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
held in place just by the way that the

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.439 
held in place just by the way that the
top<00:01:00.719> grabbed<00:01:01.440> onto<00:01:01.710> it<00:01:02.039> and<00:01:02.160> I<00:01:02.699> had<00:01:03.180> to<00:01:03.300> raise

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
top grabbed onto it and I had to raise

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.780 
top grabbed onto it and I had to raise
the<00:01:03.809> middle<00:01:04.559> a<00:01:04.680> little<00:01:04.949> bit<00:01:05.070> as<00:01:05.220> you<00:01:05.339> see<00:01:05.549> here

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
the middle a little bit as you see here

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.789 
the middle a little bit as you see here
to<00:01:06.210> make<00:01:06.330> room<00:01:06.510> for<00:01:06.540> this<00:01:06.840> vent<00:01:07.140> let's<00:01:07.619> see

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
to make room for this vent let's see

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.160 
to make room for this vent let's see
these<00:01:08.130> are<00:01:08.189> events<00:01:08.520> that<00:01:08.760> um<00:01:09.060> help<00:01:09.780> keep<00:01:10.020> the

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
these are events that um help keep the

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.200 
these are events that um help keep the
visor<00:01:10.650> from<00:01:10.770> not<00:01:10.950> fogging<00:01:11.220> up<00:01:11.520> just<00:01:11.909> so<00:01:12.000> it<00:01:12.090> has

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
visor from not fogging up just so it has

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.270 
visor from not fogging up just so it has
it's<00:01:12.360> moving<00:01:12.630> for<00:01:12.750> the<00:01:12.780> air<00:01:12.930> to<00:01:13.080> escape<00:01:13.200> so<00:01:14.100> it

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
it's moving for the air to escape so it

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.039 
it's moving for the air to escape so it
was<00:01:14.400> very<00:01:14.670> important<00:01:15.119> to<00:01:15.180> keep<00:01:15.299> those<00:01:15.479> clear<00:01:15.840> I

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
was very important to keep those clear I

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.780 
was very important to keep those clear I
know<00:01:16.500> some<00:01:16.830> people<00:01:16.920> like<00:01:17.070> to<00:01:17.220> fill<00:01:17.430> these<00:01:17.549> up

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
know some people like to fill these up

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.460 
know some people like to fill these up
to<00:01:17.970> make<00:01:18.090> it<00:01:18.210> more<00:01:18.299> aerodynamic<00:01:19.049> and<00:01:19.170> I'll<00:01:19.320> see

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
to make it more aerodynamic and I'll see

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:20.359 
to make it more aerodynamic and I'll see
what<00:01:19.619> goes<00:01:19.770> in<00:01:19.950> there

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
what goes in there

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.789 
what goes in there
now<00:01:20.880> these<00:01:21.119> side<00:01:21.390> these<00:01:21.840> are<00:01:21.900> two<00:01:22.229> buttons<00:01:22.650> one

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
now these side these are two buttons one

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.469 
now these side these are two buttons one
holds<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:23.280> chinstrap<00:01:23.580> which<00:01:24.030> is<00:01:24.150> the<00:01:24.270> gray

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
holds the chinstrap which is the gray

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.690 
holds the chinstrap which is the gray
one<00:01:24.689> and<00:01:24.720> the<00:01:25.020> red<00:01:25.229> one<00:01:25.259> holds<00:01:25.740> the<00:01:25.830> cheek<00:01:26.430> pads

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
one and the red one holds the cheek pads

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.609 
one and the red one holds the cheek pads
so<00:01:27.540> I<00:01:27.570> cut<00:01:27.900> it<00:01:27.990> to<00:01:28.020> that<00:01:28.200> it<00:01:28.320> would<00:01:28.439> wedge

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
so I cut it to that it would wedge

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.620 
so I cut it to that it would wedge
against<00:01:28.920> these<00:01:29.159> two<00:01:29.369> buttons<00:01:29.670> and<00:01:29.970> kind<00:01:30.570> of

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
against these two buttons and kind of

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.300 
against these two buttons and kind of
create<00:01:30.960> a<00:01:30.990> force<00:01:31.409> that<00:01:31.619> presses<00:01:31.950> it<00:01:32.070> right

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
create a force that presses it right

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.760 
create a force that presses it right
against<00:01:32.549> the<00:01:32.670> edge<00:01:32.700> of<00:01:32.970> the<00:01:33.060> helmet<00:01:33.329> so<00:01:33.960> that's

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
against the edge of the helmet so that's

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.170 
against the edge of the helmet so that's
about<00:01:34.920> it<00:01:35.040> guys<00:01:35.070> these<00:01:35.430> are<00:01:35.579> my<00:01:35.670> ideas<00:01:35.759> on<00:01:36.090> how

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
about it guys these are my ideas on how

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.760 
about it guys these are my ideas on how
to<00:01:36.240> make<00:01:36.450> this<00:01:36.600> visor<00:01:36.869> work<00:01:37.259> for<00:01:37.439> this<00:01:37.560> helmet

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
to make this visor work for this helmet

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.580 
to make this visor work for this helmet
I<00:01:38.040> hope<00:01:38.490> you<00:01:38.670> give<00:01:39.479> it<00:01:39.509> a<00:01:39.630> shot<00:01:39.840> and<00:01:40.079> tell<00:01:40.500> me

go<00:01:48.950> over<00:01:49.310> the<00:01:49.430> helmet<00:01:49.550> and<00:01:49.790> be<00:01:49.910> able<00:01:50.000> to<00:01:50.300> slide

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:50.660 
go over the helmet and be able to slide

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:52.510 
go over the helmet and be able to slide
up<00:01:50.870> and<00:01:51.020> down<00:01:51.110> such<00:01:51.560> as<00:01:51.710> in<00:01:51.860> most<00:01:51.980> downhill

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:52.520 
up and down such as in most downhill

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.550 
up and down such as in most downhill
helmet<00:01:52.820> you<00:01:53.450> will<00:01:53.540> have<00:01:53.660> to<00:01:53.810> do<00:01:53.900> some<00:01:54.080> drilling

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:54.560 
helmet you will have to do some drilling

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.590 
helmet you will have to do some drilling
into<00:01:54.890> the<00:01:54.920> sides<00:01:55.370> of<00:01:55.520> the<00:01:55.580> helmet<00:01:55.940> it<00:01:56.120> is<00:01:56.390> not

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:56.600 
into the sides of the helmet it is not

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.000 
into the sides of the helmet it is not
through<00:01:56.840> the<00:01:56.930> hard<00:01:57.170> fall<00:01:57.440> or<00:01:57.590> anything<00:01:57.620> like

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:58.010 
through the hard fall or anything like

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:59.500 
through the hard fall or anything like
that<00:01:58.070> it<00:01:58.430> is<00:01:58.550> just<00:01:58.729> through<00:01:58.910> the<00:01:59.030> very<00:01:59.210> thin

00:01:59.500 --> 00:01:59.510 
that it is just through the very thin

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:02.260 
that it is just through the very thin
wall<00:01:59.750> of<00:01:59.990> the<00:02:00.229> plastic<00:02:00.830> on<00:02:01.010> the<00:02:01.100> outside<00:02:01.430> and<00:02:01.670> I

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270 
wall of the plastic on the outside and I

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:04.000 
wall of the plastic on the outside and I
use<00:02:02.420> just<00:02:02.570> used<00:02:02.840> two<00:02:03.020> Hardware<00:02:03.470> bolts<00:02:03.740> you<00:02:03.830> can

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:04.010 
use just used two Hardware bolts you can

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:05.560 
use just used two Hardware bolts you can
see<00:02:04.100> on<00:02:04.190> the<00:02:04.310> outside<00:02:04.430> two<00:02:04.850> mounting<00:02:05.240> bolts

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:05.570 
see on the outside two mounting bolts

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:09.460 
see on the outside two mounting bolts
and<00:02:06.310> the<00:02:07.310> effect<00:02:07.550> is<00:02:07.670> okay<00:02:08.000> because<00:02:08.539> the<00:02:09.020> visor

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
and the effect is okay because the visor

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:11.800 
and the effect is okay because the visor
isn't<00:02:09.830> perfectly<00:02:10.160> snug<00:02:10.550> and<00:02:11.000> kind<00:02:11.300> of<00:02:11.390> perfect

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 
isn't perfectly snug and kind of perfect

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:13.780 
isn't perfectly snug and kind of perfect
for<00:02:11.900> the<00:02:12.200> helmet<00:02:12.560> I<00:02:12.740> had<00:02:13.190> to<00:02:13.310> leave<00:02:13.430> some<00:02:13.580> space

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
for the helmet I had to leave some space

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.810 
for the helmet I had to leave some space
so<00:02:14.120> it<00:02:14.240> wasn't<00:02:14.570> a<00:02:14.660> perfect<00:02:15.020> seal<00:02:15.550> between<00:02:16.550> the

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:16.820 
so it wasn't a perfect seal between the

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:18.340 
so it wasn't a perfect seal between the
visor<00:02:17.000> and<00:02:17.120> the<00:02:17.239> helmet<00:02:17.570> to<00:02:17.720> make<00:02:17.870> it<00:02:18.020> go<00:02:18.170> up

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:18.350 
visor and the helmet to make it go up

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:20.050 
visor and the helmet to make it go up
and<00:02:18.440> down<00:02:18.620> otherwise<00:02:19.040> it<00:02:19.220> would<00:02:19.340> not<00:02:19.489> move<00:02:19.730> so

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
and down otherwise it would not move so

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.510 
and down otherwise it would not move so
basically<00:02:20.989> I<00:02:21.110> decided<00:02:21.709> to<00:02:21.860> put<00:02:22.070> it<00:02:22.100> inside

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:22.520 
basically I decided to put it inside

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:25.270 
basically I decided to put it inside
able<00:02:22.880> to<00:02:22.970> more<00:02:23.120> streamline<00:02:23.570> but<00:02:24.200> the<00:02:24.530> tips<00:02:25.130> on

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
able to more streamline but the tips on

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:26.470 
able to more streamline but the tips on
the<00:02:25.370> outside<00:02:25.670> are<00:02:25.790> pretty<00:02:25.940> much<00:02:26.000> the<00:02:26.150> same<00:02:26.180> you

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
the outside are pretty much the same you

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.510 
the outside are pretty much the same you
hold<00:02:26.720> over<00:02:26.930> visualize<00:02:27.860> where<00:02:28.070> you<00:02:28.160> wanted

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:28.520 
hold over visualize where you wanted

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:29.830 
hold over visualize where you wanted
what<00:02:28.670> it's<00:02:28.790> going<00:02:28.910> to<00:02:28.970> pivot<00:02:29.209> on<00:02:29.480> what<00:02:29.720> the

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
what it's going to pivot on what the

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:31.960 
what it's going to pivot on what the
pivot<00:02:30.140> point<00:02:30.350> is<00:02:30.470> going<00:02:30.650> to<00:02:30.770> be<00:02:30.860> you<00:02:31.640> mark<00:02:31.880> out

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
pivot point is going to be you mark out

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:33.370 
pivot point is going to be you mark out
your<00:02:32.150> holes<00:02:32.390> and<00:02:32.720> then<00:02:32.840> you<00:02:32.930> pick<00:02:33.140> the<00:02:33.170> right

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:33.380 
your holes and then you pick the right

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:36.070 
your holes and then you pick the right
size<00:02:33.620> and<00:02:33.650> drill
