this is be a Jinbei so here you can see

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:29.380 
this is be a Jinbei so here you can see
the<00:01:24.340> diagonals<00:01:25.340> for<00:01:26.320> is<00:01:27.320> called<00:01:27.619> the<00:01:28.390> Taylor

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:29.390 
the diagonals for is called the Taylor

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:37.389 
the diagonals for is called the Taylor
report<00:01:30.549> going<00:01:31.549> here<00:01:31.819> if<00:01:32.299> I<00:01:32.450> open<00:01:32.719> that<00:01:36.189> you<00:01:37.189> can

00:01:37.389 --> 00:01:37.399 
report going here if I open that you can

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:42.520 
report going here if I open that you can
see<00:01:37.840> there<00:01:38.840> are<00:01:38.959> two<00:01:39.079> two<00:01:40.009> parts<00:01:41.200> in<00:01:42.200> the<00:01:42.350> upper

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:42.530 
see there are two two parts in the upper

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:49.169 
see there are two two parts in the upper
parts<00:01:44.110> from<00:01:45.520> website<00:01:46.520> this<00:01:47.420> set<00:01:47.840> can<00:01:48.200> be

00:01:49.169 --> 00:01:49.179 
parts from website this set can be

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:53.440 
parts from website this set can be
second<00:01:50.179> sort<00:01:50.479> actually<00:01:51.049> for<00:01:52.009> the<00:01:52.399> it<00:01:53.299> is

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 
second sort actually for the it is

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:58.990 
second sort actually for the it is
called<00:01:53.659> TVs<00:01:54.259> TVs<00:01:56.409> means-test<00:01:57.409> breakfasty<00:01:58.159> so

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.000 
called TVs TVs means-test breakfasty so

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:16.730 
called TVs TVs means-test breakfasty so
what<00:01:59.270> I<00:01:59.299> need<00:01:59.599> to<00:01:59.720> do<00:01:59.869> is<00:02:00.099> just<00:02:01.750> just

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:28.020 

just<00:02:17.850> drown<00:02:18.850> it<00:02:19.080> properly<00:02:26.640> the<00:02:27.640> ground<00:02:27.880> it

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
just drown it properly the ground it

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:31.200 
just drown it properly the ground it
means<00:02:28.180> you<00:02:28.750> can<00:02:28.990> clinically<00:02:29.860> reckless<00:02:30.280> to<00:02:31.030> be

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
this weapon that can cause happens and

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:44.490 
this weapon that can cause happens and
now<00:02:42.130> we're<00:02:42.310> going<00:02:42.580> to<00:02:42.700> not<00:02:43.390> mine<00:02:43.570> engine<00:02:43.870> not

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
now we're going to not mine engine not

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:55.250 
now we're going to not mine engine not
actors<00:02:44.800> that<00:02:45.070> just<00:02:45.430> to<00:02:45.580> just<00:02:46.240> to<00:02:46.620> switch<00:02:47.620> on

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:05.970

yeah just yeah yeah a record is to
electrode<00:03:06.460> if<00:03:07.330> you<00:03:07.450> close<00:03:07.660> to<00:03:07.840> see<00:03:08.050> you<00:03:08.680> can

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:08.830 
electrode if you close to see you can

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:13.320 
electrode if you close to see you can
see<00:03:09.010> one<00:03:09.280> long<00:03:09.840> -<00:03:10.840> and<00:03:11.140> too<00:03:12.040> short<00:03:12.340> -<00:03:12.970> that

see one long - and too short - that

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:18.690 
see one long - and too short - that
means<00:03:13.540> one<00:03:14.130> in<00:03:16.530> 2:112<00:03:17.560> the<00:03:17.980> record<00:03:18.280> is<00:03:18.430> to<00:03:18.550> it

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:18.700 
means one in 2:112 the record is to it

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:23.280 
means one in 2:112 the record is to it
it<00:03:19.390> will<00:03:19.690> be<00:03:20.040> repeatedly<00:03:21.040> shown<00:03:21.600> until<00:03:22.600> we

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:36.330 
switch off the ignition is one one long
pass<00:03:33.850> and<00:03:34.440> two<00:03:35.440> short<00:03:35.830> plans

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:36.340 
pass and two short plans

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:39.600 
pass and two short plans
okay<00:03:37.240> now<00:03:37.660> the<00:03:37.720> error<00:03:37.900> code<00:03:38.110> is<00:03:38.140> to<00:03:38.830> it<00:03:39.040> I<00:03:39.250> know

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:26.870 
speed sensor simply if this problem is

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:30.190 
speed sensor simply if this problem is
very<00:04:26.900> sensor<00:04:28.210> so<00:04:29.210> there's<00:04:29.660> the<00:04:29.780> different

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:30.200 
very sensor so there's the different

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:35.800 
very sensor so there's the different
data<00:04:30.350> port<00:04:30.620> calls<00:04:33.190> this<00:04:34.190> sensor<00:04:34.940> signal<00:04:35.690> is

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:35.810 
data port calls this sensor signal is

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:40.530 
data port calls this sensor signal is
missing<00:04:36.169> but<00:04:36.800> in<00:04:36.980> here<00:04:37.280> the<00:04:37.880> cases<00:04:38.300> is<00:04:38.540> it<00:04:38.990> the

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:40.540 
missing but in here the cases is it the

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:45.570 
missing but in here the cases is it the
first<00:04:41.540> initial<00:04:41.990> set<00:04:43.210> initial<00:04:44.210> checkup<00:04:44.540> it

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:45.580 
first initial set initial checkup it

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:52.380 
first initial set initial checkup it
gives<00:04:47.320> the<00:04:48.520> feedback<00:04:49.520> signal<00:04:49.970> but<00:04:50.330> the<00:04:50.360> signal

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:52.390 
gives the feedback signal but the signal

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:57.340 
gives the feedback signal but the signal
it<00:04:53.390> is<00:04:53.720> not<00:04:54.410> in<00:04:54.620> order<00:04:54.860> to<00:04:55.220> be<00:04:55.400> I<00:04:55.640> mean<00:04:56.350> the

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:57.350 
it is not in order to be I mean the

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:01.810 
it is not in order to be I mean the
signal<00:04:57.770> is<00:04:57.890> not<00:04:58.070> correct<00:04:58.700> so<00:04:58.940> that's<00:04:59.690> I<00:05:00.190> be<00:05:01.190> if

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:01.820 
signal is not correct so that's I be if

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:04.390 
signal is not correct so that's I be if
you<00:05:01.970> system<00:05:02.419> identifies<00:05:02.960> my<00:05:03.169> past<00:05:03.440> circuit

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:04.400 
you system identifies my past circuit

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:09.250 
you system identifies my past circuit
paleo<00:05:06.610> ABS<00:05:07.610> wheel<00:05:07.790> speed<00:05:08.270> sensor<00:05:08.660> otherwise

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:09.260 
paleo ABS wheel speed sensor otherwise

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:13.450 
paleo ABS wheel speed sensor otherwise
it<00:05:09.410> is<00:05:09.440> a<00:05:09.800> excess<00:05:10.280> that<00:05:10.720> the<00:05:12.400> signal<00:05:13.400> is

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:13.460 
it is a excess that the signal is

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:18.700 
it is a excess that the signal is
missing<00:05:13.850> from<00:05:14.620> wheel<00:05:15.620> speed<00:05:15.950> sensor<00:05:16.310> so<00:05:17.710> that

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:18.710 
missing from wheel speed sensor so that

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:22.030 
missing from wheel speed sensor so that
that's<00:05:19.100> it<00:05:19.810> now<00:05:20.810> you<00:05:20.870> know<00:05:21.200> how<00:05:21.470> to<00:05:21.530> diagnose

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:22.040 
that's it now you know how to diagnose

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:26.250 
that's it now you know how to diagnose

without<00:05:27.260> having<00:05:27.710> it<00:05:27.860> scan<00:05:28.580> tool<00:05:28.820> so<00:05:29.660> thanks

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:30.200 
without having it scan tool so thanks

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:32.590 
without having it scan tool so thanks
