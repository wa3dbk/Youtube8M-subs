another<00:01:14.159> amazing<00:01:14.549> breakthrough<00:01:15.119> we<00:01:15.600> have

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
another amazing breakthrough we have

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.600 
another amazing breakthrough we have
enough<00:01:15.840> in<00:01:15.960> it<00:01:16.080> his<00:01:16.619> machine<00:01:17.009> could<00:01:17.189> actually

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
enough in it his machine could actually

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.800

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:23.020 

I'm<00:01:21.470> Kansas<00:01:21.950> discovered<00:01:22.430> that<00:01:22.520> his<00:01:22.610> radio

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:23.030 
I'm Kansas discovered that his radio

checked<00:01:47.060> out<00:01:47.210> John's<00:01:47.509> amazing<00:01:48.020> invention<00:01:48.470> and

00:01:48.639 --> 00:01:48.649 
checked out John's amazing invention and

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:51.639 
checked out John's amazing invention and
they<00:01:48.979> were<00:01:49.040> amazed<00:01:49.729> and<00:01:50.149> we<00:01:50.750> saw<00:01:50.990> it<00:01:51.170> go<00:01:51.350> up<00:01:51.470> to

00:01:51.639 --> 00:01:51.649 
they were amazed and we saw it go up to

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:54.580 
they were amazed and we saw it go up to
1,500<00:01:52.250> degrees<00:01:52.310> centigrade<00:01:53.060> the<00:01:54.050> temperature

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590 
1,500 degrees centigrade the temperature

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:59.440 
1,500 degrees centigrade the temperature
and<00:01:55.250> they<00:01:55.429> and<00:01:56.619> it's<00:01:57.619> incredible<00:01:58.280> this<00:01:59.060> simple
