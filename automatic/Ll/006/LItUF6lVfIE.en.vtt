00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.560
 Dear friends, welcome to 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:07.170
 this video i'm just in 

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:10.440
 beautiful scotland sitting at one 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:14.780
 hole around and photograph and want 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.780
 show you how to focus infinitely 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:25.470
 we are currently training for four 

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:27.810
 landscape photography in scotland it 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.259
 has become as horny as much can 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.259
 I only say 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.860
 m 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:45.660
 the finish line so a small spot where 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.650
 We never in the training at all 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.630
 training sat that we actually have 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:50.660
 only then seen here the spot as 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:52.590
 we recorded something before 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:54.300
 during the training is us 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.100
 noticed that we have no video yet 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.110
 have done what infinitely focus 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.570
 and again and again just emerges 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:02.879
 gulp videos or at general 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.339
 long exposure at night and videos 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:08.490
 the question on how to focus 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.590
 actually to infinity and that would like 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.080
 I show you in this video and 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.729
 which in different ways like you 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.190
 can focus on infinity 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:20.220
 the simplest way is if the objective 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:23.280
 For example, there is a scale in front here 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.850
 my tokina 11 to 16 mm 28 has one 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.940
 scale 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.500
 and there are different values ​​on it and 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:30.060
 I can go to the front and 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.390
 I hope I do not get down the hill 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:39.030
 fall and for example here there are feet and meters 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:41.850
 indicator and there is 03 03 50 57 12 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:44.429
 and an infinite sign 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:47.310
 and it really is so if that 

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:49.500
 On the one hand everything is off 1 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.190
 meter distance you have sharp on the 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.530
 2 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:55.800
 since everything from two meters away 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:58.110
 have sharp and infinitely everything 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:00.470
 Endless shaaf means everything 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:03.470
 is over two meters away 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:03.470
 focussed 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:09.830
 Of course, so depending on the dazzle and ever 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:11.270
 depth of field is not everything 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:12.590
 sharp behind that means you can 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:16.100
 Now do not say where I focus on 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:17.750
 0.35 and then from 0.35 to infinity 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:20.600
 almost all sharp that is not 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:23.239
 but if you are on the infinite 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:25.850
 sign since all is actually over 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:28.730
 two meters sharp that is very very cool 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:30.560
 because just 16 millimeters anyway 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:32.989
 with me the landscape photography is it 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:35.480
 so that almost everything is more than 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:37.310
 three or more than two meters away 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.350
 sometimes it is so stony in the 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:40.760
 foreground are a bit closer 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:42.860
 but you can over the depth of field 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:44.900
 the blind fix some or me 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:47.090
 then focus on the extra again 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:49.010
 stone for example and then paste that in 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:51.470
 photoshop together but so easy 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:53.930
 actually on this infinite sign 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:55.910
 at the back of this lying eight quasi turn 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:57.049
 and then you are automatically 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:59.239
 infinite, for example, when I'm starring 

00:02:57.049 --> 00:03:00.680
 Just take a picture at night 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:04.010
 shot until the stop at the 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:05.870
 objectively and then everything is sharp 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:07.489
 gives objective there is infinite 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:09.590
 Do not sign at the end 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:11.630
 that means you have to go there on the line 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:13.820
 turn that is very important because if 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:15.860
 Otherwise you will turn to the end of the objective 

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:19.600
 it is out of focus again that depends on the 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:19.600
 type of lenses together 

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:24.850
 and then there are still the objective 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:26.920
 have no indication for example that 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:29.320
 objectively what is in the 600d while the 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:31.120
 18 55 objective of which I so often 

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:33.400
 Talk what already in the videos 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:35.230
 relatively often have seen where there are 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.160
 no indication and it has one more 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:38.410
 further disadvantage 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:40.570
 it has the focus here the objective 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:42.460
 for example, here has the focus and 

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:45.180
 Many other lenses include the kit 

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:47.590
 Objective has the focus here 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:49.300
 means if I have set something 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:51.280
 and then, for example, a filter on 

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:54.160
 screw the focus changes again 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:56.560
 and that's annoying but like her 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:58.180
 such an objective also sets sharp 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:00.940
 that's pretty much synonymous 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:04.600
 simply you just go into life 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:06.190
 leader then to the magnifying glass and 

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:08.710
 then you can with your cross with yours 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:10.360
 stick this rectangle where 

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:12.250
 you want and then I go to one 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:13.660
 far away point most of the time 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:15.910
 farthest point or example 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:18.160
 in photographs 8 I go to one 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:19.810
 points lit or who for example like that 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:21.850
 sometimes the moon is a lantern 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:24.190
 or something and then focus on it 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:26.110
 important that there is no zoom when you zoom 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:28.600
 and the focus changes again 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:30.070
 does not mean zoom but digital here 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:32.590
 go in and then you can go here 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:34.210
 just focus on the front 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:36.370
 Objectively turning, for example, the kit 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:38.140
 objectively and say that's shaaf then 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:40.030
 go back to the magnifying glass then you are 

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:42.100
 outside and then the recording could 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:43.840
 do it there it is actually so far 

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:45.790
 distant points that's easy 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:48.100
 Mostly it is so straightforward most of the time 

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:50.740
 bavaria wide-angled focal length to 

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:51.610
 34 meters is actually already infinite 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:54.120
 but you can not generalize 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:55.720
 depends on the objective and at 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:57.490
 zoom lenses or at 

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:59.260
 longer focal lengths it is like that 

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:00.730
 mostly infinite a bit more 

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:03.850
 further away is that means it can too 

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:06.550
 be that infinitely from six meters 

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:09.010
 from 18 meters only begins that hangs then 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:11.230
 from the focal length so actually 

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:13.300
 not so difficult and me personally 

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:14.710
 use very often and especially when 

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:16.180
 you have your objective where you actually are 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:17.920
 you do not have to have an ad 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:19.120
 somehow more focus or through 

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:21.940
 look the seeker or whatever 

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:23.830
 that's really cool and worth saying 

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:25.750
 Everything of modern blabla is not 

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:27.190
 so earlier there were objective 

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:28.630
 or cameras were there 

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:31.600
 no seeker where you could look through 

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:32.980
 or had cook hole where you do not over 

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:34.900
 the mirror had seen something like this and 

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:37.449
 then just feels like 

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:40.690
 then focused here too 

00:05:37.449 --> 00:05:42.550
 go to distances and that is 

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:44.800
 right as cool so in the end here 

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:46.539
 also very oldschool but also does 

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:48.130
 actually just when you're at 

00:05:46.539 --> 00:05:49.840
 night in the dark light situations 

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:54.210
 simply focused on turning the wheel and 

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:56.380
 zack everything is sharp and finally 

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:57.490
 that you have this week I am looking forward to 

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:59.919
 you liked it if that is so 

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:01.630
 also comes on the first of september 

00:05:59.919 --> 00:06:03.280
 the landscape photography training 

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:05.830
 we are snipping all the time on 

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:08.770
 and already take training in the photo and 

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:12.190
 to see the correction it is epic horny 

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:13.750
 the can have rejoiced on it yet 

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:14.620
 more videos about the photographing the 

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:16.960
 last two too 

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:18.100
 Landscape photography as a theme below 

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:19.539
 There is a subscribe button on it 

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:21.129
 do not miss a video anymore 

00:06:19.539 --> 00:06:23.169
 next to it 

00:06:21.129 --> 00:06:24.689
 link pose he main.de is the 

00:06:23.169 --> 00:06:27.699
 give training there is still 

00:06:24.689 --> 00:06:29.649
 rest places for Dusseldorf near 

00:06:27.699 --> 00:06:30.459
 but I believe only four pieces 

00:06:29.649 --> 00:06:32.289
 Do not know how to give me the video 

00:06:30.459 --> 00:06:32.800
 come out today and have a seat for 

00:06:32.289 --> 00:06:34.989
 usedom 

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:37.389
 So it carries from the last places 

00:06:34.989 --> 00:06:39.219
 race for the first time this year 

00:06:37.389 --> 00:06:41.019
 and lean back and work new ones 

00:06:39.219 --> 00:06:41.919
 great projects for next year what 

00:06:41.019 --> 00:06:44.879
 do not forget google 

00:06:41.919 --> 00:06:44.879
 since my constant
