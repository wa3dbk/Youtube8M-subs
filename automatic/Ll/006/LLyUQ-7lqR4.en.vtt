 aa two o'clock in the afternoon 

00:00:10.499 --> 00:00:13.499

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.249
 he was in intensive care 

00:00:23.249 --> 00:00:24.900
 and according to the reports that the head 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.099
 it will be increasingly difficult 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:27.619
 that could recover 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:30.960

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:36.739
 I do not want to enter the game 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:39.110
 but death 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:42.130

 who was Carlos monsiváis according to capital 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:47.750
 a man of 72 years 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:49.610
 It was a man who 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:52.470
 understood or the country in which he lived in his post 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:56.090
 suppose it from several bolillo optics you only say topics like 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:57.190
 intellectual 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:00.290
 but rather as it has always happened with guys 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:03.260
 of the few writers in which the only writer who is known in the 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:04.110
 court 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.020
 p the museum s 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:07.960
 the day 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:09.200
 one remembers 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.920
 many of the things that made many of the attitudes he suffered 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:14.930
 no doubt in a character 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:15.870
 reference 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:19.330
 he knew how to understand it 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:22.680
 especially at times when it was like very overwhelming there were very few 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.969
 critical voices as now all are democrats 

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:26.730
 tremosa and I was not 17 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:29.240
 he had very very positions 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:30.149
 critics 

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:32.150
 in situations 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:35.150
 it was a bit like society countercurrent 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.970
 spoke of the diversity that always 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:40.560
 was critical with Cuba of what was happening with Cuba 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.500
 he was critical with the Mexican left 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.120
 very critical of the pri with the bread with the church 

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:47.690
 but above all the man who knew how to read things 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:49.750
 I supported Carlos Monsivais 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:52.330
 it gives them the impression that it is very difficult to recover in terms 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:54.150
 Of the health 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:55.940
 your server lung or like many 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:57.670
 He knew how to look but pointing 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:01.080
 had tremendous experiences with Carlos much deficit physical trips 

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:11.909
 expertise about mexico that crossed me 

00:02:11.909 --> 00:02:14.079
 on more than one occasion bulls 

00:02:14.079 --> 00:02:17.039
 Moratinos has said that I was in charge of the elections 

00:02:17.039 --> 00:02:20.579
 because it was very funny because he told things and also because 

00:02:21.469 --> 00:02:22.859
 san martín audacity and 

00:02:22.859 --> 00:02:25.519
 the one that ended up arriving and talked with without knowing why 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:29.879
 when we travel demo with his big red suitcase laden cleaning Castro as 

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:32.319
 these studies up germany obeying 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:36.079
 then I carried it in his suitcase and many of these this 

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:39.310
 conflict with the Palestinians and work stoppage the belt is made 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:43.860
 I was calando out there because it's this by Frankfurt train station from the 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:47.370
 mac the archer between the inter that has weighed and hilarious to the train that we 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:48.479
 must lead to colony 

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:51.189
 no it was not truly formidable yes many other 

00:02:51.189 --> 00:02:54.189
 and I must remind you that when that flower falls a lot 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:56.460
 in colony the apache bm 

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:58.019
 in this room he left 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:01.219
 he was truly applauded 

00:03:01.219 --> 00:03:02.499
 all engine world 

00:03:02.499 --> 00:03:04.139
 weird would be that 

00:03:04.139 --> 00:03:05.669
 a man who knew how to read mexico 

00:03:05.669 --> 00:03:07.959
 a hill that his colleague people on the street 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:10.919
 that the powers wonderful years very 

00:03:10.919 --> 00:03:15.929
 from the Mexican cinema about women to that very famous 

00:03:15.929 --> 00:03:18.769
 per hundred articles published in the magazine 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:22.730
 forget the magazine always cultural supplement class of the 70 in 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:26.349
 the famous cultural supplement of the magazine provided an essay was 

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:30.150
 formidable grew the title that we saw a lot the school and 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:32.619
 then I superior to my students 

00:03:32.619 --> 00:03:33.919
 hehehe 

00:03:33.919 --> 00:03:35.069
 I'm not sick 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:39.459
 what happens is that it's wrong I'm back and a parenthesis opens and it was called that 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:41.869
 to the aesthetics of acys 

00:03:41.869 --> 00:03:43.009
 psoe vision 

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:47.749
 this of the nec and be it then it was with much prudence to say what depth 

00:03:47.749 --> 00:03:50.909
 rest in peace, Carlos monsiváis, I think the tributes were few 

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:54.430
 the recognition will be eternal. It has been done that you have not done for you. 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:56.179
 the cocoon option to get away from that 

00:03:56.179 --> 00:03:58.479
 many that we had 

00:03:58.479 --> 00:03:59.699
 but he has lamented 

00:03:59.699 --> 00:04:02.699
 lee baca secondary students 

00:04:04.399 --> 00:04:07.379
 today many dogs like jenaro villamil habitat be more than sad their 

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:09.509
 very close friends sent ahead 

00:04:09.509 --> 00:04:11.659
 I'm thinking those who were always close to him 

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:15.129
 one who had the fortune and fortune to find a moment while talking to 

00:04:15.129 --> 00:04:16.840
 he feels pain 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:19.569
 and in good measure I tell him that sadness goes hand in hand 

00:04:19.569 --> 00:04:23.099
 the loss of the person because in the atrium of the consciousness of intelligence 

00:04:23.099 --> 00:04:24.189
 from ee 

00:04:24.189 --> 00:04:25.529
 they are two characters that 

00:04:25.529 --> 00:04:26.919
 that they were not moving 

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:28.800
 because we are missing the time of 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.430
 larger through sessions 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:33.990
 but we hope that your example and reading that we all have cases of your 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:35.499
 work
