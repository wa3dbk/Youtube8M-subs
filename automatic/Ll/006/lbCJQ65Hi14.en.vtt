00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.210
 at youtube I'm back green grid 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:05.879
 market 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:07.560
 the great background yes, I am the 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:11.099
 possibility i am a big big one 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:14.009
 rawlings begins so interested 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:19.080
 not here he comes my second 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:21.570
 I was tutorial last time 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.510
 I promised you that I show you the 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.939
 a keyboard figure enzo I once had 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.500
 something prepared again and I will 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.310
 Do it all a bit more accurate today 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.310
 records 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.489
 if I accelerate something then 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:53.230
 if that's what andi haid and now 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:56.310
 I'll let's see if she runs well so 

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:56.310
 as I imagined 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:14.469
 so 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.469
 give me that again 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:19.990
 Yes and it works just as I think about it 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:21.880
 have imagined the way we run though 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:24.570
 you can see how important dynamic 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.570
 last video 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:29.290
 she rows with the poor as well as everyone 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:32.410
 actually when running if he is right 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:38.100
 running fast now I do that sometimes 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:44.320
 more and more yes you can stop that 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:48.210
 so the steps slow down a bit 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:48.210
 you can see how it moves 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:55.629
 so the states with him a leg 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:01.110
 that went one leg forward 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:05.310
 is a jump she is almost with both 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:07.320
 legs in the air when running landed 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:08.610
 on the other foot again and the whole 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:12.390
 starts again from the beginning 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:17.850
 then it burns so and so what 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:20.100
 you here jobs vigorously and the next 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:24.180
 tutorial I am here to show how 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:28.070
 a keyboard figure jumps the same way 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:28.070
 have detailed or detailed here 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:38.510
 yes that would be me but only if 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:38.510
 I have 50 sky I have two now 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:44.520
 until then have fun with mine 

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:49.860
 videos if I'm still in between 

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:52.050
 which make me see again 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:54.090
 write my comments to days 

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:56.370
 they want some of them 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:58.440
 program I am the then I do 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:04.280
 of it a tutorial if I then 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:04.280
 I write yes 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:12.420
 well
