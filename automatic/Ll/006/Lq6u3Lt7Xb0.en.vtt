00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:48.430
 good afternoon dear friends today we have 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:52.750
 again pastel painting and my goal 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:55.780
 classes tell you about bedding tricks 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:59.500
 and what we are 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:03.730
 work or you want to work 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:06.850
 these beds that you saw on the screen 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:10.270
 they never fail is good 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:14.500
 the quality can be very dry 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:16.539
 pastel or a little softer this one can 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:19.869
 use only look to 

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:23.160
 she was not very chamber then of course 

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:23.160
 she tears the paper 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:32.410
 put there are two kinds of basic 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:39.970
 this is a multi-layer painting as in oil 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:43.289
 and watercolors and ols right this we sat down and behind 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:48.119
 as if you did not press next 

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:52.720
 don't go to the next layer you have it 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:58.450
 looks great very modern here 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:02:00.819
 An example of the first picture we have is hanging on 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:03.729
 wall plain work perfect 

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:06.429
 it was designed for a master class 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:08.520
 which we recorded is multi-layered 

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:12.580
 painting 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:18.010
 2 second picture in front of us 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:18.700
 this is a single-layer painting that is olya 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:23.160
 straight 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:29.099
 she made unlike this work 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:29.099
 with the edge of the bed 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:36.430
 and the work is basically seaming later 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:39.010
 shading and end of course already well 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:42.760
 bed arrows but when you roll in 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:46.629
 make such movements as if more 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:48.040
 grab a place on paper or on cardboard 

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:53.280
 what do you work 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:56.469
 in general there was some in bed 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:59.280
 materials on which artists work 

00:02:56.469 --> 00:02:59.280
 this 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:02.970
 cardboard 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:10.150
 colored paper very colored paper 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:14.790
 dense it almost borders on cardboard 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:18.840

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:23.940
 Modern materials also include 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:26.920

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:31.799
 Stalin materials on which the artist 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:34.690
 worked refers suede on suede done 

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:39.569
 many artists are wonderful 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:42.670
 work looking at this work is very difficult 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:45.760
 imagine that they work alone are made 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:48.910
 in pastels and practically like 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:54.910
