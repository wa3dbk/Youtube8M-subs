so<00:00:38.080> as<00:00:38.140> you'll<00:00:38.260> see<00:00:38.410> immediately<00:00:38.800> the<00:00:38.890> draw

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:39.370 
so as you'll see immediately the draw

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:43.140 
so as you'll see immediately the draw
distance<00:00:39.430> is<00:00:39.940> absolutely<00:00:40.570> horrendous

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:43.150 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:45.790 

it's<00:00:44.150> almost<00:00:44.630> like<00:00:44.930> a<00:00:44.960> Fargo<00:00:45.410> that<00:00:45.530> isn't

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:45.800 
it's almost like a Fargo that isn't

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.350 
it's almost like a Fargo that isn't
there<00:00:46.040> if<00:00:46.400> it<00:00:46.760> makes<00:00:47.620> textures<00:00:48.620> pop<00:00:48.920> up<00:00:49.100> and

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:49.360 
there if it makes textures pop up and

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:53.170 
there if it makes textures pop up and
blurring<00:00:50.360> to<00:00:50.840> view<00:00:51.140> the<00:00:51.530> grass<00:00:51.860> that<00:00:52.340> rose<00:00:52.580> the

whatever they all pop into view in a
horrible<00:01:02.480> way<00:01:02.630> which<00:01:02.900> make<00:01:03.110> the<00:01:03.290> game<00:01:03.440> look

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:04.030 
horrible way which make the game look

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:09.020 
horrible way which make the game look
wild

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.000 

as<00:01:09.600> you<00:01:09.750> will<00:01:09.869> see<00:01:09.900> at<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.140> beginning<00:01:10.470> it<00:01:10.799> was

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
as you will see at the beginning it was

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.700 
as you will see at the beginning it was
all<00:01:11.190> on<00:01:11.610> low<00:01:12.420> settings<00:01:12.869> I'm<00:01:13.049> gonna<00:01:13.260> gonna<00:01:13.409> land

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
all on low settings I'm gonna gonna land

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.539 
all on low settings I'm gonna gonna land
a<00:01:13.890> chopper<00:01:13.950> and<00:01:14.460> throw<00:01:14.700> it<00:01:14.850> into<00:01:14.970> ultra<00:01:15.390> have<00:01:16.110> a

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:16.549 
a chopper and throw it into ultra have a

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:21.170 
a chopper and throw it into ultra have a
good<00:01:17.549> example<00:01:17.670> to<00:01:19.460> show<00:01:20.460> that<00:01:20.729> it<00:01:20.850> is<00:01:20.880> across

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
good example to show that it is across

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:34.940 
good example to show that it is across
the<00:01:21.479> city

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.490 

so<00:01:35.909> other<00:01:36.090> than<00:01:36.119> a<00:01:36.299> slight<00:01:36.689> drop<00:01:36.930> in<00:01:36.960> FPS<00:01:37.350> is

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
so other than a slight drop in FPS is

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.620 
so other than a slight drop in FPS is
not<00:01:37.649> really<00:01:37.860> much<00:01:38.009> difference<00:01:38.430> you'll<00:01:39.180> notice

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
not really much difference you'll notice

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.580 
not really much difference you'll notice
still<00:01:40.259> immediately<00:01:40.740> that<00:01:40.920> the

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:42.590 
still immediately that the

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.219 
still immediately that the
foggy<00:01:43.250> blur<00:01:43.880> Randy<00:01:44.359> the<00:01:44.450> distance<00:01:44.810> thing<00:01:45.020> is

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:45.229 
foggy blur Randy the distance thing is

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:47.889 
foggy blur Randy the distance thing is
there<00:01:45.820> it<00:01:46.820> doesn't<00:01:47.119> really<00:01:47.270> seem<00:01:47.539> to<00:01:47.600> matter

00:01:47.889 --> 00:01:47.899 
there it doesn't really seem to matter

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:51.010 
there it doesn't really seem to matter
what<00:01:48.289> setting<00:01:48.590> direct<00:01:49.299> it<00:01:50.299> is<00:01:50.719> more

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 
what setting direct it is more

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.230 
what setting direct it is more
noticeable<00:01:51.289> on<00:01:51.859> higher<00:01:52.250> settings<00:01:52.759> because<00:01:52.939> of

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:53.240 
noticeable on higher settings because of

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.899 
noticeable on higher settings because of
the<00:01:53.329> tessellation<00:01:53.750> on<00:01:54.020> the<00:01:54.140> Sun<00:01:54.399> it<00:01:55.399> makes<00:01:55.640> it

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:55.909 
the tessellation on the Sun it makes it

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:57.459 
the tessellation on the Sun it makes it
much<00:01:56.060> more<00:01:56.270> visible<00:01:56.659> when<00:01:56.810> the<00:01:56.929> sand<00:01:57.140> pops

00:01:57.459 --> 00:01:57.469 
much more visible when the sand pops

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:59.930 
much more visible when the sand pops

00:01:59.930 --> 00:01:59.940 
interview

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:02.110 
interview
it<00:02:00.120> just<00:02:00.330> really<00:02:00.630> makes<00:02:00.930> the<00:02:01.140> game<00:02:01.260> look<00:02:01.320> whole

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:02.120 
it just really makes the game look whole

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:05.540 
it just really makes the game look whole
for<00:02:03.120> someone<00:02:03.420> who<00:02:03.570> has<00:02:04.470> played<00:02:04.620> a<00:02:04.740> lot<00:02:04.980> of<00:02:05.010> FPS

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:05.550 
for someone who has played a lot of FPS

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:09.020 
for someone who has played a lot of FPS
made<00:02:06.300> a<00:02:06.330> lot<00:02:06.660> of<00:02:06.690> different<00:02:07.430> FPS<00:02:08.430> from

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
made a lot of different FPS from

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.920 
made a lot of different FPS from
battlefield<00:02:09.540> 3<00:02:10.050> back<00:02:10.920> to<00:02:11.190> bad<00:02:11.940> company<00:02:12.510> 2<00:02:12.660> and

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
battlefield 3 back to bad company 2 and

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:17.480 
battlefield 3 back to bad company 2 and
most<00:02:13.410> of<00:02:13.590> the<00:02:13.680> cut<00:02:13.860> games<00:02:15.680> this<00:02:16.680> is<00:02:16.890> really

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490 
most of the cut games this is really

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:21.100 
most of the cut games this is really
horrible

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:23.470 

it's<00:02:21.590> like<00:02:21.770> all<00:02:22.070> of<00:02:22.430> the<00:02:22.520> time<00:02:22.760> architectures

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
it's like all of the time architectures

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:24.670 
it's like all of the time architectures
and<00:02:23.510> the<00:02:23.690> grass<00:02:23.870> textures<00:02:24.320> are<00:02:24.440> like<00:02:24.560> an

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
and the grass textures are like an

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.960 
and the grass textures are like an
overlay<00:02:25.190> on<00:02:25.250> top<00:02:25.340> of<00:02:25.840> map<00:02:27.580> and<00:02:28.580> when<00:02:28.730> you<00:02:28.820> get

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
overlay on top of map and when you get

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.060 
overlay on top of map and when you get
out<00:02:29.060> of<00:02:29.090> a<00:02:29.270> distance<00:02:29.600> the<00:02:29.720> overlaid<00:02:30.170> vanishes

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:31.070 
out of a distance the overlaid vanishes

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:34.450 
out of a distance the overlaid vanishes
as<00:02:31.460> you<00:02:31.730> approach<00:02:32.120> it<00:02:32.480> reappears<00:02:33.440> it<00:02:34.340> is

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:34.460 
as you approach it reappears it is

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:38.080 
as you approach it reappears it is
really<00:02:34.730> home<00:02:35.060> on<00:02:36.370> the<00:02:37.370> plus<00:02:37.550> side<00:02:37.580> you<00:02:37.790> patch

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
really home on the plus side you patch

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:40.480 
really home on the plus side you patch
did<00:02:38.330> seem<00:02:38.570> to<00:02:38.600> fix<00:02:38.960> some<00:02:39.650> of<00:02:39.680> the<00:02:39.800> net<00:02:40.070> coding

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:40.490 
did seem to fix some of the net coding

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:43.570 
did seem to fix some of the net coding
issues<00:02:40.640> as<00:02:41.060> they're<00:02:41.330> being<00:02:41.540> called<00:02:42.580> hit

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:43.580 
issues as they're being called hit

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:45.940 
issues as they're being called hit
detection<00:02:43.760> has<00:02:44.300> improved<00:02:44.660> so<00:02:44.930> look<00:02:45.140> when

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
detection has improved so look when

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:48.580 
detection has improved so look when
you've<00:02:46.460> got<00:02:46.610> this<00:02:46.790> slight<00:02:47.750> constant<00:02:48.350> thicker

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
you've got this slight constant thicker

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:50.320 
you've got this slight constant thicker
which<00:02:48.800> isn't<00:02:49.160> really<00:02:49.190> too<00:02:49.580> visible<00:02:49.790> on<00:02:50.150> this

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:50.330 
which isn't really too visible on this
