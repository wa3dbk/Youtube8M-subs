00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:57.480 
I'm completely drawn away it's I think

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:59.740 
I'm completely drawn away it's I think
that<00:01:57.720> is<00:01:57.930> fo<00:01:58.170> is<00:01:58.500> really<00:01:58.890> going<00:01:59.010> to<00:01:59.100> be<00:01:59.280> the

00:01:59.740 --> 00:01:59.750 
that is fo is really going to be the

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.780 
that is fo is really going to be the
single<00:02:00.750> most<00:02:00.870> significant<00:02:01.530> step<00:02:01.800> in<00:02:02.100> us

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
getting into the European market I think

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:06.500 
getting into the European market I think
it's<00:02:05.580> going<00:02:05.640> to<00:02:05.760> go<00:02:05.820> beyond<00:02:06.300> and<00:02:06.450> above

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:06.510 
it's going to go beyond and above

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.970 
brings with it I think would have been
very<00:02:18.240> difficult<00:02:18.480> to<00:02:18.780> do<00:02:18.930> I<00:02:19.170> mean<00:02:19.650> it<00:02:19.770> comes

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
very difficult to do I mean it comes

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.530 
very difficult to do I mean it comes
immediately<00:02:20.280> it<00:02:20.730> comes<00:02:20.940> with<00:02:21.120> a<00:02:21.150> stamp<00:02:21.420> of

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
immediately it comes with a stamp of

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.140 
immediately it comes with a stamp of
approval<00:02:21.660> from<00:02:22.590> an<00:02:22.770> organization<00:02:23.550> which<00:02:23.910> is

known and respected and that's hard to

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.160 
known and respected and that's hard to
do<00:02:26.430> and<00:02:27.090> it's<00:02:27.270> actually<00:02:27.360> open<00:02:27.720> up<00:02:27.780> sales<00:02:28.020> for
