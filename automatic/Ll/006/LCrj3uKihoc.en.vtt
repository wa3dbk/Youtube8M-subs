so hemoglobin gene has a function in our

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.240 
so hemoglobin gene has a function in our

plane in erythrocytes where the function
is<00:02:11.370> oxygen<00:02:11.790> transport<00:02:12.860> so<00:02:13.860> the<00:02:13.980> gene<00:02:14.220> is<00:02:14.520> gene

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
is oxygen transport so the gene is gene

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.050
