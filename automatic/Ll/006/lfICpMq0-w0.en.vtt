 I think this would be fucking talking to a lot of little ideas, so if you're name 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:10.830
 When you are a candidate for this talk, I am still using the same example 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:16.619

 In my case it has spent 4 as from the first moment, however, is another battering 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:25.650
 I do not enjoy 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:26.580
 Oh really four coming eight months clean turbid even months to live like that again now 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.660

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:37.890
 But then, what happened was that you came out . 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:42.890
 I think it 's different by the time . Oh, I have a lot to learn, 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:46.460
 It 's the coolest thing to learn to do. 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:51.620
 When I saw this one a little earlier missing 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:56.379
 It is not free at all. 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:01:02.540

 I think I 'm buying a store. 

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:12.229
 I'll be damned. As soon as the child is interviewed for a year 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:17.930
 No, do not. 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:22.250
 sr. So I do not have to be sensitive to revelation. 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:23.960
 It was not easy for me to live like this in an unfamiliar environment. 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:28.340
 I'm a moderator. 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:32.720
 When I write a very loving mother, no doubt because she had been ahead of wedding 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:37.460
 It shows designer dishes are great leads No. 4 is now flashing not quite perfect 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:42.530
 So for example, you want me to inform me geureongeol daughter-in-law since lived a life free 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:48.350
 It taught me this and that to me is awesome because you do not have that reaction, 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:51.650
 I have to have sense when I eat food in the morning of the West Sea Finance. 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:56.869

00:01:51.650 --> 00:02:01.070
 My mother's hair was very rough 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:02.420
 That'll hand agonizing four in the morning, a fifth qualification eopna look after these thoughts 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:07.460
 Because 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:14.720
 So I guess I did not choose to go out afterwards . 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:18.950
