00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:17.739 
which you start off with eight so you

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:19.170 
which you start off with eight so you
don't<00:03:17.950> generally<00:03:18.340> skip<00:03:18.519> that<00:03:18.639> phase<00:03:18.880> for<00:03:19.120> a

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:19.180 
don't generally skip that phase for a

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.240 
don't generally skip that phase for a
couple<00:03:19.389> times<00:03:19.739> then<00:03:20.739> you<00:03:20.859> produce<00:03:21.069> your

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:21.250 
couple times then you produce your

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:23.069 
couple times then you produce your
resources<00:03:21.819> and<00:03:22.090> so<00:03:22.510> that<00:03:22.630> means<00:03:22.840> that<00:03:22.959> your

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:23.079 
resources and so that means that your

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:24.900 
resources and so that means that your
planet<00:03:23.410> so<00:03:23.500> you<00:03:23.560> have<00:03:23.709> in<00:03:23.799> play<00:03:23.980> will<00:03:24.459> give<00:03:24.790> you

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:24.910 
planet so you have in play will give you

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:27.150 
planet so you have in play will give you
resources<00:03:25.090> to<00:03:25.599> spend<00:03:25.930> on<00:03:26.109> cards<00:03:26.470> and<00:03:26.650> also<00:03:27.069> you

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:27.160 
resources to spend on cards and also you

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.520 
resources to spend on cards and also you
get<00:03:27.250> a<00:03:27.310> draw<00:03:27.549> one<00:03:27.790> card<00:03:27.819> from<00:03:28.090> each<00:03:28.269> pile<00:03:28.540> then

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:29.530 
get a draw one card from each pile then

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:30.990 
get a draw one card from each pile then
it's<00:03:29.709> a<00:03:29.799> trade<00:03:30.010> phase<00:03:30.250> which<00:03:30.519> is<00:03:30.549> the<00:03:30.790> fun

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000 
it's a trade phase which is the fun

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.729 
it's a trade phase which is the fun
phase<00:03:31.209> because<00:03:31.569> then<00:03:31.720> you<00:03:31.810> get<00:03:31.930> to<00:03:31.959> negotiate

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:32.739 
phase because then you get to negotiate

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:36.870 
phase because then you get to negotiate
and<00:03:33.040> based<00:03:33.700> upon<00:03:34.030> how<00:03:35.099> how<00:03:36.099> much<00:03:36.310> of<00:03:36.430> a<00:03:36.519> barter

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:36.880 
and based upon how how much of a barter

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:38.220 
and based upon how how much of a barter
traitor<00:03:37.209> you<00:03:37.419> are<00:03:37.450> you<00:03:37.750> know<00:03:37.840> it<00:03:37.900> could<00:03:38.019> become

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:38.230 
traitor you are you know it could become

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:40.979 
traitor you are you know it could become
very<00:03:38.410> heated<00:03:38.650> during<00:03:39.190> that<00:03:39.430> phase<00:03:39.669> a<00:03:40.569> good

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:40.989 
very heated during that phase a good

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:43.740 
very heated during that phase a good
rule<00:03:41.139> of<00:03:41.260> thumb<00:03:41.319> for<00:03:41.829> training<00:03:42.700> is<00:03:42.849> that<00:03:43.150> the

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:43.750 
rule of thumb for training is that the

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:45.870 
rule of thumb for training is that the
cost<00:03:44.019> of<00:03:44.230> the<00:03:44.260> card<00:03:44.560> up<00:03:44.950> here<00:03:45.340> is<00:03:45.519> that<00:03:45.700> the

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:45.880 
cost of the card up here is that the

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:47.430 
cost of the card up here is that the
number<00:03:46.120> up<00:03:46.209> here<00:03:46.239> tells<00:03:46.660> the<00:03:46.840> cost<00:03:47.109> of<00:03:47.380> the

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:47.440 
number up here tells the cost of the

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:49.020 
number up here tells the cost of the
card<00:03:47.650> how<00:03:47.829> much<00:03:47.980> resources<00:03:48.489> get<00:03:48.760> the<00:03:48.819> pay<00:03:48.970> to

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.030 
card how much resources get the pay to

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:51.150 
card how much resources get the pay to
play<00:03:49.209> the<00:03:49.419> card<00:03:49.599> and<00:03:50.019> the<00:03:50.349> color<00:03:50.590> tells<00:03:50.859> the

play the card and the color tells the

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:52.409 
play the card and the color tells the
color<00:03:51.370> of<00:03:51.459> the<00:03:51.579> resource<00:03:51.910> that<00:03:52.030> you<00:03:52.150> need<00:03:52.299> to

00:03:52.409 --> 00:03:52.419 
color of the resource that you need to

00:03:52.419 --> 00:03:54.750 
color of the resource that you need to
pay<00:03:52.569> that<00:03:52.599> card<00:03:53.019> a<00:03:53.829> good<00:03:54.190> rule<00:03:54.310> of<00:03:54.400> thumb<00:03:54.459> is

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:54.760 
pay that card a good rule of thumb is

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:57.330 
pay that card a good rule of thumb is
that<00:03:54.790> this<00:03:55.060> is<00:03:55.239> good<00:03:55.480> indicator<00:03:56.349> of<00:03:56.410> value<00:03:56.799> so

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:57.340 
that this is good indicator of value so

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:59.069 
that this is good indicator of value so
a<00:03:57.370> 2<00:03:57.639> for<00:03:57.880> a<00:03:57.910> 2<00:03:58.120> would<00:03:58.329> be<00:03:58.359> a<00:03:58.480> good<00:03:58.720> trade

00:03:59.069 --> 00:03:59.079 
a 2 for a 2 would be a good trade

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:01.530 
a 2 for a 2 would be a good trade
perhaps<00:03:59.530> ton<00:04:00.430> of<00:04:00.519> course<00:04:00.669> ideally<00:04:00.940> benefiting

you both above everyone else exactly

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:06.190 
you both above everyone else exactly
ectly<00:04:04.270> then<00:04:05.270> after<00:04:05.480> the<00:04:05.569> trade<00:04:05.750> base<00:04:05.959> comes

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:06.200 
ectly then after the trade base comes

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:07.420 
ectly then after the trade base comes
your<00:04:06.319> diplomacy<00:04:06.680> phase<00:04:06.950> and<00:04:07.099> that's<00:04:07.220> where

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:07.430 
your diplomacy phase and that's where

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:09.040 
your diplomacy phase and that's where
the<00:04:07.819> action<00:04:08.120> happens<00:04:08.150> that's<00:04:08.660> where<00:04:08.780> you<00:04:08.930> get

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:09.050 
the action happens that's where you get

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:10.930 
the action happens that's where you get
to<00:04:09.200> attack<00:04:09.440> other<00:04:09.620> players<00:04:09.980> and<00:04:10.370> other

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:10.940 
to attack other players and other

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:13.630 
to attack other players and other
players<00:04:11.270> if<00:04:11.690> you<00:04:11.930> initiate<00:04:12.650> a<00:04:12.680> diplomacy

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:13.640 
players if you initiate a diplomacy

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:16.120 
players if you initiate a diplomacy
phase<00:04:13.819> then<00:04:14.480> you<00:04:14.840> have<00:04:15.020> the<00:04:15.140> yet<00:04:16.010> to<00:04:16.040> be

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:16.130 
phase then you have the yet to be

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:17.560 
phase then you have the yet to be
careful<00:04:16.489> because<00:04:16.609> other<00:04:16.880> people<00:04:17.180> then<00:04:17.329> can

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:17.570 
careful because other people then can

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:19.000 
careful because other people then can
use<00:04:17.810> their<00:04:17.959> diplomacy<00:04:18.350> cards<00:04:18.560> against<00:04:18.829> you

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:19.010 
use their diplomacy cards against you

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:21.550 
use their diplomacy cards against you
and<00:04:19.250> come<00:04:20.150> jump<00:04:20.389> in<00:04:20.480> and<00:04:20.630> defend<00:04:20.720> and<00:04:21.139> then

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:21.560 
and come jump in and defend and then

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:24.100 
and come jump in and defend and then
finally<00:04:21.950> is<00:04:22.040> the<00:04:22.130> industry<00:04:22.639> phase<00:04:22.880> where<00:04:23.660> you

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:24.110 
finally is the industry phase where you

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:26.710 
finally is the industry phase where you
build<00:04:24.470> your<00:04:24.650> empire<00:04:24.710> you<00:04:25.550> use<00:04:25.820> the<00:04:26.180> resources

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:26.720 
build your empire you use the resources

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:27.970 
build your empire you use the resources
that<00:04:26.810> you<00:04:26.930> have<00:04:27.230> and<00:04:27.470> the<00:04:27.530> cards<00:04:27.770> you<00:04:27.830> have<00:04:27.889> in

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:27.980 
that you have and the cards you have in

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:29.379 
that you have and the cards you have in
your<00:04:28.070> hand<00:04:28.310> you<00:04:28.669> can<00:04:28.820> put<00:04:28.970> them<00:04:29.090> down<00:04:29.240> into

00:04:29.379 --> 00:04:29.389 
your hand you can put them down into

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:31.180 
your hand you can put them down into
play<00:04:29.690> and<00:04:29.930> then<00:04:30.230> you<00:04:30.320> get<00:04:30.410> to<00:04:30.530> use<00:04:30.680> those<00:04:30.860> cards

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:31.190 
play and then you get to use those cards

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:32.740 
play and then you get to use those cards
throughout<00:04:31.370> the<00:04:31.520> game<00:04:31.669> and<00:04:31.910> the<00:04:32.419> gameplay

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:32.750 
throughout the game and the gameplay

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:34.560 
throughout the game and the gameplay
mechanics<00:04:33.200> are<00:04:33.320> very<00:04:33.560> very<00:04:33.680> simple<00:04:33.919> to<00:04:34.250> learn

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:34.570 
mechanics are very very simple to learn

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:37.090 
mechanics are very very simple to learn
but<00:04:35.570> the<00:04:35.870> depth<00:04:36.110> of<00:04:36.290> the<00:04:36.380> game<00:04:36.560> comes<00:04:36.830> from<00:04:37.010> the

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:37.100 
but the depth of the game comes from the

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:40.090 
but the depth of the game comes from the
different<00:04:37.370> cards<00:04:37.729> in<00:04:37.880> which<00:04:38.419> you<00:04:38.870> are<00:04:39.290> if

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:40.100 
different cards in which you are if

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:41.950 
different cards in which you are if
you're<00:04:40.550> able<00:04:40.729> to<00:04:41.030> basically<00:04:41.150> go<00:04:41.750> down

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:41.960 
you're able to basically go down

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:43.480 
you're able to basically go down
multiple<00:04:42.380> paths<00:04:42.620> and<00:04:42.919> you<00:04:43.070> can<00:04:43.190> even<00:04:43.280> switch

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:43.490 
multiple paths and you can even switch

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:45.280 
multiple paths and you can even switch
colors<00:04:43.880> which<00:04:44.060> will<00:04:44.180> give<00:04:44.330> you<00:04:44.419> entirely<00:04:44.990> new

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:45.290 
colors which will give you entirely new

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:47.020 
colors which will give you entirely new
branches<00:04:45.770> of<00:04:45.950> passive<00:04:46.340> options<00:04:46.700> that<00:04:46.910> you

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:47.030 
branches of passive options that you

you<00:05:05.360> know<00:05:05.419> they've<00:05:05.570> always<00:05:05.690> the<00:05:06.139> game<00:05:06.320> ends

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:06.530 
you know they've always the game ends

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:07.870 
you know they've always the game ends
and<00:05:06.740> they<00:05:06.800> still<00:05:07.040> like<00:05:07.160> oh<00:05:07.310> I<00:05:07.340> wanted<00:05:07.700> to<00:05:07.760> do

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:07.880 
and they still like oh I wanted to do

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:08.950 
and they still like oh I wanted to do
this<00:05:08.060> this<00:05:08.210> and<00:05:08.270> this<00:05:08.450> and<00:05:08.539> this<00:05:08.720> and<00:05:08.810> they

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:08.960 
this this and this and this and they

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:10.810 
this this and this and this and they
couldn't<00:05:09.229> do<00:05:09.350> it<00:05:09.470> because<00:05:09.620> the<00:05:10.340> game<00:05:10.490> is<00:05:10.610> over

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:10.820 
couldn't do it because the game is over

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:12.490 
couldn't do it because the game is over
so<00:05:11.270> in<00:05:11.539> that<00:05:11.690> sense<00:05:11.930> it's<00:05:12.140> great<00:05:12.320> because

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:12.500 
so in that sense it's great because

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:13.600 
so in that sense it's great because
people<00:05:12.830> want<00:05:12.979> to<00:05:13.039> come<00:05:13.100> back<00:05:13.250> and<00:05:13.400> play<00:05:13.490> it

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:13.610 
people want to come back and play it

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:15.580 
people want to come back and play it
again<00:05:13.940> and<00:05:14.060> again<00:05:14.120> and<00:05:14.300> again<00:05:14.539> and<00:05:14.780> this<00:05:15.440> is<00:05:15.560> a

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:15.590 
again and again and again and this is a

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:17.680 
again and again and again and this is a
complete<00:05:15.950> gaming<00:05:16.310> system<00:05:16.760> so<00:05:17.210> there's<00:05:17.479> the
