like<00:00:17.100> this<00:00:17.940> pentatonic<00:00:18.930> run

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:29.740 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:35.620 

before<00:00:30.740> the<00:00:31.660> tricky<00:00:32.660> part<00:00:32.930> so<00:00:33.350> right<00:00:33.920> now<00:00:34.630> this

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:35.630 
before the tricky part so right now this

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:39.700 
before the tricky part so right now this
is<00:00:35.840> pretty<00:00:36.170> hard<00:00:36.710> to<00:00:37.420> make<00:00:38.420> fast<00:00:38.720> as<00:00:39.050> well<00:00:39.320> so

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:39.710 
is pretty hard to make fast as well so

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.780 
is pretty hard to make fast as well so
practice<00:00:40.220> slow<00:00:41.050> anyway<00:00:42.050> we<00:00:42.890> starting<00:00:43.400> on<00:00:43.610> the

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:43.790 
practice slow anyway we starting on the

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:47.229 
practice slow anyway we starting on the
same<00:00:44.059> note<00:00:44.270> as<00:00:44.540> way<00:00:44.780> under<00:00:45.110> the<00:00:46.100> 12th<00:00:46.790> fret<00:00:46.910> on

00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:47.239 
same note as way under the 12th fret on

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:52.479 
same note as way under the 12th fret on
the<00:00:47.360> g<00:00:48.290> string<00:00:48.430> we<00:00:49.430> pick<00:00:49.670> twice<00:00:51.250> then<00:00:52.250> we<00:00:52.340> go

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:52.489 
the g string we pick twice then we go

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:57.729 
the g string we pick twice then we go
down<00:00:52.520> to<00:00:53.030> 14<00:00:53.690> and<00:00:54.050> 12<00:00:54.380> on<00:00:54.739> the<00:00:55.130> D<00:00:55.550> string<00:00:56.739> like

00:00:57.729 --> 00:00:57.739 
down to 14 and 12 on the D string like

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:02.350 
down to 14 and 12 on the D string like
that<00:00:58.010> so<00:00:59.890> and<00:01:00.890> then<00:01:01.070> we<00:01:01.160> go<00:01:01.339> to<00:01:01.370> the<00:01:01.790> fourteenth

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:02.360 
that so and then we go to the fourteenth

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:07.330 
that so and then we go to the fourteenth
fret<00:01:02.510> on<00:01:02.809> the<00:01:02.900> g<00:01:03.530> string<00:01:03.559> and<00:01:05.770> we<00:01:06.770> pick<00:01:06.980> twice

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:07.340 
fret on the g string and we pick twice

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:09.790 
fret on the g string and we pick twice
there<00:01:07.700> as<00:01:07.880> well<00:01:08.150> so<00:01:08.420> the<00:01:08.900> whole<00:01:09.200> thing<00:01:09.530> sounds

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:09.800 
there as well so the whole thing sounds

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:16.840 
there as well so the whole thing sounds
like<00:01:10.010> this<00:01:13.600> let<00:01:14.600> me<00:01:14.690> go<00:01:14.840> back<00:01:15.110> to<00:01:15.320> 12<00:01:15.710> and<00:01:16.640> we

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:16.850 
like this let me go back to 12 and we

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:23.170 
like this let me go back to 12 and we
pick<00:01:17.090> 12<00:01:17.740> 14<00:01:18.740> and<00:01:19.570> twice<00:01:20.570> on<00:01:20.930> the<00:01:21.909> next<00:01:22.909> string

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:23.180 
pick 12 14 and twice on the next string

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:27.620 
pick 12 14 and twice on the next string
B<00:01:23.840> string<00:01:24.200> 12<00:01:24.590> so<00:01:25.310> it<00:01:25.460> sounded<00:01:25.880> easy

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
B string 12 so it sounded easy

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.130 
B string 12 so it sounded easy
from<00:01:28.469> 12<00:01:29.009> 14<00:01:29.880> and<00:01:30.210> then<00:01:30.539> we're<00:01:30.630> going<00:01:30.780> to<00:01:30.869> be

from 12 14 and then we're going to be

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:38.600 
from 12 14 and then we're going to be
string<00:01:31.590> and<00:01:31.920> 12<00:01:35.360> and<00:01:36.360> then<00:01:36.509> we'll<00:01:36.659> go<00:01:36.780> back<00:01:37.610> to

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:21.089 

then<00:02:17.060> we<00:02:17.150> gotta<00:02:17.300> go

00:02:21.089 --> 00:02:21.099 

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:25.330 

so<00:02:22.099> that<00:02:22.400> is<00:02:22.670> we<00:02:23.390> go<00:02:23.540> back<00:02:23.810> to<00:02:23.840> 12<00:02:24.380> foot<00:02:24.739> on<00:02:24.980> the

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
so that is we go back to 12 foot on the

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:30.010 
so that is we go back to 12 foot on the
same<00:02:25.610> strain<00:02:26.000> B<00:02:26.360> string<00:02:28.120> then<00:02:29.120> we'll<00:02:29.239> pick<00:02:29.480> 14

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:30.020 
same strain B string then we'll pick 14

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:34.300 
same strain B string then we'll pick 14
on<00:02:30.349> the<00:02:30.560> g<00:02:30.830> string<00:02:30.860> and<00:02:32.620> then<00:02:33.620> we<00:02:33.770> go<00:02:33.890> up<00:02:34.040> to<00:02:34.190> the

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 
on the g string and then we go up to the

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:40.440 
on the g string and then we go up to the
high<00:02:34.520> E<00:02:34.550> string<00:02:34.849> and<00:02:35.480> we<00:02:35.900> pick<00:02:36.170> 12<00:02:36.590> twice<00:02:37.900> so

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
high E string and we pick 12 twice so

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:47.850 
high E string and we pick 12 twice so
and<00:02:41.450> then<00:02:42.349> we<00:02:42.530> go<00:02:42.680> to<00:02:42.709> the<00:02:43.040> B<00:02:43.250> string<00:02:43.610> and<00:02:43.880> 15<00:02:44.780> 12

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:47.860 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:52.509 

like<00:02:48.860> that<00:02:49.360> then<00:02:50.360> you<00:02:50.599> finish<00:02:51.019> on<00:02:51.530> the<00:02:51.890> high<00:02:52.489> E

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:52.519 
like that then you finish on the high E

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:59.870 
like that then you finish on the high E
string<00:02:52.760> on<00:02:53.360> 15<00:02:54.140> with<00:02:54.530> twice<00:02:55.780> 22<00:02:56.780> notes

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:09.270 

so<00:03:01.260> sound<00:03:02.260> like<00:03:02.440> this

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.040 

and<00:03:09.850> right<00:03:10.090> after<00:03:10.270> that<00:03:10.450> you<00:03:10.810> pull<00:03:11.380> off<00:03:11.590> to<00:03:12.010> 12

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.050 
and right after that you pull off to 12

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:21.390 
and right after that you pull off to 12
spider<00:03:16.170> so<00:03:18.150> pull<00:03:19.150> off<00:03:19.330> the<00:03:19.510> 12<00:03:19.780> and<00:03:20.110> then<00:03:21.010> we<00:03:21.220> go

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 
spider so pull off the 12 and then we go

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:26.940 
spider so pull off the 12 and then we go
15<00:03:22.360> 14

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:26.950 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:31.860 

so

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:33.780 

and<00:03:32.319> then<00:03:32.769> we're<00:03:32.920> going<00:03:33.069> to<00:03:33.159> go<00:03:33.220> something

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:33.790 
and then we're going to go something

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:39.089 
and then we're going to go something
like<00:03:33.819> this<00:03:36.180> and<00:03:37.180> that<00:03:37.450> is<00:03:37.870> just<00:03:38.230> a<00:03:38.530> hammer-on

00:03:39.089 --> 00:03:39.099 
like this and that is just a hammer-on

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:42.839 
like this and that is just a hammer-on
and<00:03:39.159> pull-off<00:03:39.459> so<00:03:40.269> you<00:03:40.840> take<00:03:41.140> 12<00:03:41.650> and<00:03:41.920> hammer

00:03:42.839 --> 00:03:42.849 
and pull-off so you take 12 and hammer

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:48.300 
and pull-off so you take 12 and hammer
on<00:03:43.060> 2<00:03:43.420> 15<00:03:44.349> threat<00:03:44.799> and<00:03:45.040> pull<00:03:45.340> off<00:03:45.549> to<00:03:46.090> 12<00:03:47.310> like

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.310 
on 2 15 threat and pull off to 12 like

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:53.700 
on 2 15 threat and pull off to 12 like
that<00:03:48.690> and<00:03:49.690> then<00:03:50.230> you<00:03:50.379> pick<00:03:50.650> 15<00:03:51.340> on<00:03:51.519> B<00:03:51.879> string

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:53.710 
that and then you pick 15 on B string
