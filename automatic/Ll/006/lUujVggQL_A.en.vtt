the satarine a rapier rappy or whatever
alright<00:03:52.099> this<00:03:52.250> one's<00:03:52.489> almost<00:03:52.639> looks

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:52.910 
alright this one's almost looks

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:54.610 
alright this one's almost looks
identical<00:03:53.480> to<00:03:53.510> the<00:03:53.690> fang<00:03:53.840> every<00:03:54.079> youth<00:03:54.260> okay

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:54.620 
identical to the fang every youth okay

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:56.800 
identical to the fang every youth okay
so<00:03:54.680> same<00:03:55.069> rate<00:03:55.220> of<00:03:55.310> fire<00:03:55.489> same<00:03:55.849> impact<00:03:56.269> same

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:56.810 
so same rate of fire same impact same

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:58.539 
so same rate of fire same impact same
range<00:03:57.139> stability<00:03:57.889> a<00:03:57.919> little<00:03:58.190> better<00:03:58.340> but

00:03:58.539 --> 00:03:58.549 
range stability a little better but

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:01.839 
range stability a little better but
that's<00:03:58.880> not<00:03:59.030> an<00:03:59.239> issue<00:03:59.329> reload<00:04:00.549> 13<00:04:01.549> rounds<00:04:01.669> in

00:04:01.839 --> 00:04:01.849

but<00:04:39.740> you<00:04:40.700> guys<00:04:40.850> also<00:04:41.090> talked<00:04:41.900> a<00:04:41.930> lot<00:04:42.200> about

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:42.260 
but you guys also talked a lot about

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.830 
but you guys also talked a lot about
this<00:04:42.650> thing<00:04:42.860> the<00:04:42.980> b-line<00:04:43.280> trauma<00:04:43.640> now<00:04:44.300> what

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:44.840 
this thing the b-line trauma now what

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:46.210 
this thing the b-line trauma now what
intrigues<00:04:45.230> me<00:04:45.350> about<00:04:45.440> this<00:04:45.740> is<00:04:45.950> the<00:04:46.040> rate<00:04:46.190> of

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:46.220 
intrigues me about this is the rate of

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:48.910 
intrigues me about this is the rate of
fire<00:04:46.460> the<00:04:47.060> impact<00:04:47.600> range<00:04:48.080> and<00:04:48.350> reload<00:04:48.620> I<00:04:48.650> am

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:48.920 
fire the impact range and reload I am

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:50.920 
fire the impact range and reload I am
NOT<00:04:49.100> digging<00:04:49.310> and<00:04:49.640> it's<00:04:50.150> also<00:04:50.300> got<00:04:50.540> away<00:04:50.750> less

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:50.930 
NOT digging and it's also got away less

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:52.870 
NOT digging and it's also got away less
around<00:04:50.960> but<00:04:51.560> I'm<00:04:51.680> thinking<00:04:52.040> this<00:04:52.160> might<00:04:52.340> be<00:04:52.580> at

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:52.880 
around but I'm thinking this might be at

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:55.870 
around but I'm thinking this might be at
PvP<00:04:53.510> type<00:04:53.750> scout<00:04:53.990> rifle<00:04:54.170> because<00:04:54.730> think<00:04:55.730> I've

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:55.880 
PvP type scout rifle because think I've

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:58.030 
PvP type scout rifle because think I've
been<00:04:56.060> killed<00:04:56.300> I<00:04:56.570> rarely<00:04:56.960> get<00:04:57.170> killed<00:04:57.440> by<00:04:57.560> Scout

00:04:58.030 --> 00:04:58.040 
been killed I rarely get killed by Scout

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:59.950 
been killed I rarely get killed by Scout
rifles<00:04:58.250> or<00:04:58.550> sniper<00:04:58.790> rifles<00:04:59.210> in<00:04:59.300> PvP<00:04:59.690> but

00:04:59.950 --> 00:04:59.960 
rifles or sniper rifles in PvP but

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:01.990 
rifles or sniper rifles in PvP but
believe<00:05:00.590> what<00:05:00.770> I<00:05:00.800> have<00:05:01.040> it's<00:05:01.370> been<00:05:01.640> from<00:05:01.850> this

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:02.000 
believe what I have it's been from this

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.060 
believe what I have it's been from this
thing<00:05:02.180> let's<00:05:03.020> see<00:05:03.170> so<00:05:03.320> missing<00:05:03.620> a<00:05:03.680> shot<00:05:03.860> is<00:05:04.040> a

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:04.070 
thing let's see so missing a shot is a

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:05.800 
thing let's see so missing a shot is a
chance<00:05:04.430> to<00:05:04.610> return<00:05:04.730> ammo<00:05:05.240> directly<00:05:05.600> to<00:05:05.720> the

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:05.810 
chance to return ammo directly to the
