00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:08.670
 3 the successor of the lg g2 who had been 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:13.170
 launched last year so there is to 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:15.450
 just nine months old then ljg 3.6 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.550
 to a new haiti with were minor 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.740
 would still be in several places 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.170
 so the first novelty is 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.619
 really his screen that's the most 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.840
 great 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.699
 I will have the greatest strength judge him and 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:30.390
 three series when they keep so at 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:33.840
 5.5 inches is besides despite the very 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.250
 small frame that makes you fat a little 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.040
 scared and the whole thing as that wider 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.790
 and cava and a little longer kl before 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.510
 also but it's still 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:44.340
 reasonable in the same yard a 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.920
 phone of this size among others 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.469
 a curve the panel in the housing 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.829
 which makes the price more 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:55.260
 comfortable in India for example sony 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.640
 burns experience now 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.800
 it's the screen there it's not just 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.670
 tall he gets a good resolution 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.010
 so 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:05.680
 quad resolution identically four 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:08.380
 times greater than 720 resolution 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:10.720
 and so it is to the public in ocular the 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:13.299
 resolution of 10.88 that we have in the 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:15.220
 most flagship android phones 

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:19.930
 moment so it's ranger and his 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:22.450
 quality and its size is really there the 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:23.770
 ratio if we want the size of the 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:25.990
 TV movie report on the screen is 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:28.539
 really there the main force 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:31.360
 is it so useful as is with 

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:33.330
 as big a resolution as it has 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:35.110
 taken some will surely say no 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:37.899
 At first glance 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:39.220
 I feel I see it a difference I 

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:41.950
 find that really the images that 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:44.110
 sees the photos are are often very 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:45.700
 clear so since in life always 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:48.610
 his luck what this initiative but 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:51.270
 really he seems to have a tackle from 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:52.630
 less visible on the bike, you know it 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.140
 our society 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:58.330
 I would say novelties there are 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:00.190
 to others, among others, related to the device 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:02.649
 digital photo so the camera is 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:04.740
 still 13 may 1.5 pixels city hall 

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:07.119
 now with 1 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:10.360
 now a stabilization function 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:13.629
 optics we also have a place of color 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:16.690
 to have the most realistic colors 

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:18.849
 is a laser focus so that's 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:22.780
 it's closed finally a very focus 

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:24.910
 very fast so we're talking about 276000 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.470
 seconds the presently what I have 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:31.660
 done here it seemed like something more 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:33.519
 long but good so it's slightly 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:34.959
 more than what is announced the father sam 

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:39.250
 according to him put the galaxy art is simple 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:42.099
 and and ashley it's with their one m8 I 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:44.230
 not believe it is 24 min for second 

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:47.110
 that will change what but this kind 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:49.870
 to see this in the dark the setting 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:51.579
 point will have to be more effective you this 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:53.980
 who should in theory be the 

00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:55.660
 especially when using the plh 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:58.720
 and compared to another 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:01.629
 another device like that is one of 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:03.760
 novelties for is interesting there are 

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:05.230
 has other software too in 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:08.489
 water on the ground 1 can be selected 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:11.970
 take a picture with a picture and 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:14.200
 activate the trigger years with its 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:16.420
 popotin currently not trained tomorrow 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:18.430
 they are taken enough and with his 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:21.519
 fist so basically we'll try to the 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:25.090
 rose garden game same as my fist and its 

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:26.970
 lips m it should trigger the 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:30.010
 trigger 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:32.380
 very pictures of the time maybe that 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:35.100
 if he recognizes - the cmfi because of this 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:38.110
 third of my camera but so that allows 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:40.510
 to take more easily by trusting 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:43.420
 group for example proposed a very 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:45.730
 great novelty but no it's there then 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:48.910
 we have also documented but will not 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:49.600
 to design so the designer and and I 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:52.600
 improved 

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:55.840
 we talked sometimes about a metal design 

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:58.930
 was not exactly the case so the and 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:00.730
 g3 and destroy a case with a 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:02.530
 that I call a metallic skin 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:05.890
 so I feel very simple one hour 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:08.350
 a finish away a wallpaper of 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:11.470
 metallos on a plastic case 

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:12.820
 so that does not give the price clim 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:14.230
 in the present will weave itself or in 1 

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:16.959
 minute but it's still more 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:19.720
 interesting that what I did with 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:22.150
 its g2 so that really gives at a 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:23.580
 more elegant look and drove 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:27.070
 I would say that it is more pleasant 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:28.500
 concrete or companies have been improved 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:31.260
 so are a lot more 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:33.990
 to use especially I 'll be there the big one 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:36.750
 button in the center with respect to proxies 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:39.810
 before that was like that so this cd so 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:42.090
 I will be there small improvements a 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:45.360
 more important now the same to 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:47.730
 a battery that is replaceable so we 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:49.590
 can remove the behind it was not 

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:51.780
 the case before she neither with the player 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:54.030
 nor with the g2 at the level of 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:56.250
 features free happened 105 

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:58.170
 dragon 801 as we are presented market 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:03.300
 on all high-end phones from 

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:06.450
 this year we also have 16 or 32 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:09.570
 gigabytes of internal capabilities and 2 or 

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:12.540
 3 gigabytes of animals life so it's going 

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:13.560
 depend on spread markets and 

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:16.669
 we do not know what's going to be 

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:19.230
 exactly still neck in canada 

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:21.900
 then the interface we see it and exchanges 

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:24.270
 and therefore able to facilitate and improve 

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:26.310
 after that I'll have a little bit more 

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:27.410
 more modern than was the case 

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:30.000
 previously 

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:31.950
 but hey most people you 

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.330
 still preferred jean what a 

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:36.000
 web interface closer to the back than 

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:38.310
 google offers with its years interface 

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.410
 and some new software too 

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:43.800
 among others security and dad at 

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:45.060
 keyboard so the keyboard a few 

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:47.610
 novelties the short carpet more 

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:49.650
 quickly so you say it adapts to 

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:52.440
 our site and we can set 

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:54.060
 some buttons and when you write to that 

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:55.680
 which is good is that in the words that 

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:57.930
 are offered in water in the register 

00:05:55.680 --> 00:06:01.550
 mussels but i want to say simon has to 

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:03.720
 either left franÃ§ois right for 

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:07.740
 select the morale 

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:10.580
 so it allows children to choose 

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:14.180
 its then have a lot easier to 

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:15.830
 quickly do that when we have the freak 

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:18.199
 and we wonder what I'm going to do 

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:19.969
 know that absolutely not convincing but 

00:06:18.199 --> 00:06:22.879
 whenever I did before 

00:06:19.969 --> 00:06:28.069
 get off better I cross in itself but 

00:06:22.879 --> 00:06:30.199
 it worked rather I do my tests 

00:06:28.069 --> 00:06:34.280
 as for wages so that's a 

00:06:30.199 --> 00:06:36.020
 wave ex software news the de lg 

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:38.419
 the mans last two titles that 

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:41.210
 I would like to speak up too 

00:06:38.419 --> 00:06:43.129
 speaker to the paladins watts so a 

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:44.810
 goiter are not a lot but a little 

00:06:43.129 --> 00:06:46.849
 boy she's testing and aly kane very 

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:49.219
 noisy it's these series it's 

00:06:46.849 --> 00:06:51.740
 impressive and finally the other 

00:06:49.219 --> 00:06:52.759
 novelty the other what I did not want 

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:56.780
 leave his launch 

00:06:52.759 --> 00:06:58.340
 so the LG 3i launched in Korea soon 

00:06:56.780 --> 00:07:00.289
 now and in canada we do not have 

00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:01.250
 still date but it should be 

00:07:00.289 --> 00:07:03.229
 announced in the next 

00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:05.569
 weeks has to have more 

00:07:03.229 --> 00:07:07.879
 I invite you to read the link 

00:07:05.569 --> 00:07:11.770
 who was at the bottom of the city and maxim 

00:07:07.879 --> 00:07:11.770
 johnson at the launch of lg 3
