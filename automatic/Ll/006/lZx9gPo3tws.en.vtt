00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.810
 In the past we created our own engine. 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:28.250
 It is a blessing and a curse. It takes a long time to cast it. 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:33.890
 Everything has to be done from the ground up, but you have control over how the engine 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.910
 works in the games you work on. 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:42.820
 In Ready at Dawn we have an idea of ​​what the game should look like 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.930
 how to develop the story and the technology used. 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.970
 By using a new engine, you start building on a different foundation. 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:54.010
 You are gaining new experience from scratch. 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:56.900
 We already had a functional PSP engine. 

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:01.950
 The PSP is about how to make it smaller and easier. 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.900
 The thing about PS4 is how to make it bigger, faster and more efficient. 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:11.960
 For me, this generation will be the most important factor 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:14.900
 how vivid and realistic the game will look like. 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.900
 We want every part of it to work 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:22.000
 Realistically, as a real environment. 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:23.890
 It's a mosaic with a series of puzzle pieces. 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:27.930
 Whether it's smoke or things blowing in the wind, everything moves 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:30.970
 exactly according to the wind in the environment. 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.930
 Or characters standing in the wind 

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:38.070
 to whom the coat coats. 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.830
 You don't even have to realize 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.820
 why it suddenly looks better, you just subconsciously perceive it. 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:47.920
 The player doesn't know why, but it looks better and more realistic. 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.820
 It took a lot of time and effort, but the movement became more realistic. 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:54.990
 You see how they move, behave, feel. 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.270
 How different they react to light. 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.040
 Much work has been done in the research of period materials. 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.560
 Even because of the slightest reflection on the material 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:09.840
 we scanned lots of textiles 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:12.960
 thereby creating its authentic appearance. 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.900
 Finding such materials today was not easy. 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:20.460
 Today there are artificial materials everywhere. 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:23.870
 With 3D scanning, we collected stacks 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.490
 records of historically accurate textiles 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:30.020
 and then we digitized them with micrometer accuracy 

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:34.820
 with all their imperfections, but also artistic skills. 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.490
 It is very difficult to simulate this from the ground up. 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.950
 We have a technology that takes care of displaying fabrics 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.010
 to fit into the scene and look like real stuff 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.490
 not like a piece of plastic wrapped around a figure. 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.860
 In the material model and their lighting 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:54.890
 we have invested a lot of work. These are two inseparable parts. 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:58.870
 Over the past 5 years they have passed 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:02.540
 both the film and gaming industries 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:06.840
 to more faithful and accurate lighting models. 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:10.890
 As a rule, the light in the games diffuses forward. 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:13.870
 Diverse types of reflections, 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:17.010
 wet reflections or material properties. 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:19.920
 So instead of direct light 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:22.830
 illuminating only the character's face 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:27.870
 here we have lights that capture, imperfections, and imply form. 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:31.910
 We have spent a lot of time and light on the lights and lights 

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:36.210
 as well as working with fog that creates a certain mood and atmosphere. 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.810
 The world in which we move, particularly hazy London, 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:44.860
 water, fog and ubiquitous hopelessness, dirt and soot, 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.840
 these are anomalies that are very difficult to process. 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:50.870
 Even London today is full of fog. 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:53.660
 But if you look at the Industrial Revolution, 

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:58.090
 you will see fog, flourishing industry, soot, immission… 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:01.030
 It's almost like another character in our world. 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:05.590
 Previously, fog was used to reduce surveillance in games. 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:08.960
 There was not enough power available, so fog came on. 

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:11.860
 Just on a PC with a high-end graphics card 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:14.910
 you could circumvent this restriction and keep an eye on it. 

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:17.650
 Today we use fog to emphasize the world and players, 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:20.010
 breathes life into the game and creates an impression in the environment. 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:23.830
 The game world makes it live and authentic, 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:25.810
 which adds to his depth. 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:29.730
 It is very important that the characters and the world work together 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:31.820
 and correspond to the place and time. 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:35.960
 Much of our story does not depend on what the characters say 

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:38.800
 or what the actors imprinted on them during the shooting. 

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:42.830
 A lot of it tells the environment, light, atmosphere. 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:45.870
 Separately, these things seem irrelevant. 

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:49.890
 But when a careful survey is put together 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:51.930
 and all these details, 

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:56.810
 the resulting impression corresponds to the level of individual details. 

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:59.020
 I think there was nothing we could say: 

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:02.060
 "That's not how it works, hardware isn't enough." 

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:05.010
 We had our hands free, so we said: 

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:08.050
 "We will improve as many aspects of the game as possible." 

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:12.880
 Technology and platform are no longer a constraint. You can do anything. 

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:16.040
 You can prepare a clean table and say: 

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:21.390
 "What do we want to do differently, what is the key to this new generation?" 

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:28.360
 For a game and a player, this means giving them the best gaming experience 

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:33.010
 the best physics we can do. Best Graphics, Animation and AI. 

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:36.830
 And we can tailor each part to hardware. 

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:38.900
 We will provide them with the best possible experience. 

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:41.940
 We can do things that weren't possible before. 

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:45.990
 The result is a really deep film impression. 

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:50.320
 The characters you care about and the environment that will amaze you 

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:53.080
 with its beauty and beauty, 

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:56.990
 they are what attracts you and forces you to spend your time in this world. 

00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:00.840
 Be careful. Hot moments are waiting for us.
