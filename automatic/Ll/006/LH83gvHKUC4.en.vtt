00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:11.680 

right<00:00:09.950> so<00:00:10.460> we've<00:00:10.940> discovered<00:00:11.240> how<00:00:11.450> to<00:00:11.480> do<00:00:11.660> a

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:11.690 
right so we've discovered how to do a

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:16.390 
right so we've discovered how to do a
magic<00:00:11.900> loop<00:00:12.850> leave<00:00:13.850> the<00:00:14.000> roll<00:00:14.150> feature<00:00:15.400> happy

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:16.400 
magic loop leave the roll feature happy

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:20.290 
magic loop leave the roll feature happy
Jason<00:00:16.939> yep<00:00:17.860> I'm<00:00:18.860> taking<00:00:19.250> the<00:00:19.340> mixer<00:00:19.670> part<00:00:19.939> no

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:20.300 
Jason yep I'm taking the mixer part no

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:28.620 
Jason yep I'm taking the mixer part no
actually<00:00:20.810> we<00:00:20.930> ended<00:00:21.230> up<00:00:22.090> right<00:00:23.259> roll<00:00:25.720> up<00:00:26.720> bro

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:28.630 
actually we ended up right roll up bro

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:37.630 
actually we ended up right roll up bro
that's<00:00:29.630> one<00:00:29.810> up<00:00:29.960> roll<00:00:30.200> sounds<00:00:30.560> like<00:00:36.370> now<00:00:37.370> we<00:00:37.430> go

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:37.640 
that's one up roll sounds like now we go

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.319 
that's one up roll sounds like now we go
from<00:00:37.730> the<00:00:37.880> down<00:00:38.120> roll<00:00:38.390> to<00:00:38.600> the<00:00:38.630> up<00:00:38.870> roll

00:00:40.319 --> 00:00:40.329 
from the down roll to the up roll

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:42.880 
from the down roll to the up roll
sometimes<00:00:41.329> we<00:00:41.780> get<00:00:41.870> the<00:00:41.989> magic<00:00:42.289> loop<00:00:42.410> never

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:42.890 
sometimes we get the magic loop never

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:45.720 
sometimes we get the magic loop never
figured<00:00:43.129> out<00:00:43.190> how<00:00:43.280> to<00:00:43.309> do<00:00:43.519> it<00:00:43.609> yet<00:00:43.730> but<00:00:44.030> watch

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:45.730 
figured out how to do it yet but watch

00:00:45.730 --> 00:01:00.230 
figured out how to do it yet but watch
no<00:00:46.730> more

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:00.240 

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:02.730 

right<00:01:01.240> I<00:01:01.330> think<00:01:01.480> we<00:01:01.690> worked<00:01:01.870> how<00:01:02.020> to<00:01:02.080> do<00:01:02.290> it<00:01:02.410> so

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:02.740 
right I think we worked how to do it so

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:06.780 
right I think we worked how to do it so
we've<00:01:02.860> got<00:01:02.980> a<00:01:03.010> normal<00:01:03.220> down<00:01:03.490> roll<00:01:05.550> go<00:01:06.550> to<00:01:06.610> the

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:06.790 
we've got a normal down roll go to the

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:08.610 
we've got a normal down roll go to the
up<00:01:06.910> roll<00:01:07.150> on<00:01:07.390> beat<00:01:07.660> and<00:01:07.810> it<00:01:07.990> should<00:01:08.230> do<00:01:08.590> a

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:08.620 
up roll on beat and it should do a

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:20.070 
up roll on beat and it should do a
normal<00:01:08.800> up<00:01:09.100> roll<00:01:18.479> before<00:01:19.479> the<00:01:19.600> beat<00:01:19.780> will<00:01:19.960> get

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:20.080 
normal up roll before the beat will get

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:33.000 
normal up roll before the beat will get
the<00:01:20.200> magic<00:01:20.500> loop

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:33.010 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:47.620 

a<00:01:34.050> teapot

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:47.630 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:02:05.609 

more<00:01:48.630> magic<00:01:49.049> loop

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:05.619 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:13.769 

Oh<00:02:10.769> troll
