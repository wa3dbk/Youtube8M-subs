 total his 33 turns and that's it it's a little 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:54.079
 gold the profession of faith split into two peak set at 1 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:57.239
 it's a long-term job that we've been doing for the last ten years 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:58.340
 pretty 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:01.100
 does the world recognize masters in the matter of masters 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:02.000
 French 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.850

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:08.010

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.520
 eilat to grind world it's a music with his shovel would be tunisie that pulls 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:20.860
 then my level in France in particular 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:25.160
 for the scratch is always associated with crack or for a spokesman of the bea to 

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:29.050
 when a couple origin of this musical stream that already announces it traces 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:31.960
 of an old to put in you can now that date the end of 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:35.840
 70s in this sense the trust spin-off for quite some time and in 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:36.160
 hour

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:40.260
 buffer 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.010
 and that now become a musical style in its own right that's what we 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:45.870
 try to explain through splintering 40 

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:47.760
