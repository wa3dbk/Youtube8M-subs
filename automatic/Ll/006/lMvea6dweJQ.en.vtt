00:00:01.450 --> 00:00:05.720
 dear viewers 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:05.720
 today car 

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:11.790
 I remember my feeling they earn 

00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:18.250
 became big 

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:18.250
 various firms 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:23.570
 can even its 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:25.020
 so 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:27.360
 main 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:29.600
 the device is 1 

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:30.750
 analog 

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:32.509
 usually 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.980
 where the light is 

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:35.980
 we are in favor 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:42.560
 filmed out 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.560
 we 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.370
 start the camera and we will 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:52.740
 now we will be in 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.660
 fran digital this 

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:55.500
 the most important camera most 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.130
 costly 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.130
 it's mate 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:04.810
 same for 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:04.810
 stick them 

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:09.390
 cost on 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:09.390
 straight from 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:19.780
 this is memory 24 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:20.730
 meters above 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:22.540
 something like 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:23.640
 in size 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:24.530
 So 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.700
 if a 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:27.700
 matrix apparatus 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.200
 standard 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:36.480
 but 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.670
 and who will have a camera to 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:40.480
 buy more 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.490
 this is china surfing 

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:46.600
 I love mooshrushin 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:46.600
 cropped matrix 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:48.870
 called she 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:51.310
 croma 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:52.260
 robot disc 8 segments 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:53.330
 on grandma 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:56.470
 have this 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:57.900
 the pros and cons of the pros and 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:59.600
 a little more 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:00.840
 so 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.230
 trimmed model 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.200
 than it is less than the camera is cheaper 

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:06.360
 tobacco 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.240
 what is our name 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.780
 it's simple 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:12.470
 with a small matrix which is something 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:13.790
 I need very expensive 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:15.260
 I feel very well 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:18.430
 2 and 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:20.969
 DSLRs are magnet 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.969
 them matrix 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:27.359
 ford not 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:27.359
 they have someone too 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.790
 on the right you will end the effect 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:32.590
 get out the most 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:35.080
 I will say there . 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:36.520
 then your 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.600
 there are 3 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:38.850
 this 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:42.600
 professional 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:45.780
 and the cameras are not even joking you 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:47.960
 good big matrices then open 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:49.710
 beautiful picture 

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:51.120
 but they are very expensive 

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:53.240
 just dear 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.550
 very expensive 

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:58.650
 later because 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:03:01.879
 average camera 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:01.879
 soy or small 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:08.300
 such is the price category 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:10.910
 absolutely no matter what camera are you 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:12.770
 you will choose no matter the film 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:15.500
 it will you wo n't stop right 

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:17.870
 SLRs are all small most important 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:20.819
 is in your head you can shoot 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:22.630
 great shots and 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:25.560
 film frames 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:27.590
 your professional nitsche 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:30.140
 resurrection in the head than not 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:32.770
 then you need to learn 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:32.770
 by position 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:36.850
 learn and 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:38.410
 so some 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:42.150
 have chosen 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:42.150
 it all depends on you 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:48.560
 one more moment 

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:50.540
 personal firms that produce 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:53.569
 camera main stages 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:55.350
 nikon pentax olympus 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:57.800
 sony from the minute 

00:03:55.350 --> 00:04:01.920
 dzhen 1s unit is missing 

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:04.030
 I think that these devices have a buttercup 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:06.730
 different manufacturers 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:08.740
 both pros and cons for example very 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:10.690
 common phenomenon when 

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:13.840
 cartwrights snitko 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:15.850
 what is yellow or not now 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:17.810
 we will see it a little bit 

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:20.410
 more 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:22.970
 and most importantly 1 go to the store 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:23.330
 try to take a different camera in 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:25.840
 the group 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:29.210
 they say take under parade that 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:30.340
 which is familiar to you in ergonomics 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:32.280
 dishes 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:34.600
 because different manufacturers 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:35.420
 spin kill different sides 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:37.569
 cut into 

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:38.639
 on and the number of legs does not look at all 

00:04:37.569 --> 00:04:41.080
 teaches therefore 

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:43.060
 take and try to shoot 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:44.939
 frames select by your price 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:48.370
 categories of this will be quite enough 

00:04:44.939 --> 00:04:49.310
 in order to start photographic 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:50.200
 activity 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:52.680
 thank 

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:52.680
 bye then 

00:04:54.790 --> 00:05:00.800
 good afternoon colleagues past video i 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:03.360
 decided to write down a little piece part 2 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:05.310
 one and a half camera 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:06.729
 when you come to the store 

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:09.580
 you 

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:12.819
 the whole apparatus consists well, for example such 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:14.620
 but you need to know that that 

00:05:12.819 --> 00:05:19.240
 the apparatus consists of two main things 

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:21.129
 is it a bird or in another way a Bose 

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:24.669
 and lenses 

00:05:21.129 --> 00:05:27.689
 if you have a camera which you 

00:05:24.669 --> 00:05:31.379
 choose or on the internet for example 

00:05:27.689 --> 00:05:34.080
 worth canon 5d mark 2 body 

00:05:31.379 --> 00:05:36.779
 This means that if you buy his product 

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:37.939
 mail dunk is just such 

00:05:36.779 --> 00:05:40.860
 box 

00:05:37.939 --> 00:05:44.129
 by itself such a box without a lens 

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:46.289
 does not work therefore how to choose to bypass 

00:05:44.129 --> 00:05:48.089
 we will talk in a couple of classes 

00:05:46.289 --> 00:05:51.119
 but keep in mind it's enough 

00:05:48.089 --> 00:05:55.589
 important thing plus so i would really 

00:05:51.119 --> 00:05:57.449
 I wanted to say that choosing a camera 

00:05:55.589 --> 00:06:01.200
 pay attention so you have three 

00:05:57.449 --> 00:06:04.380
 basic manual modes 

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:08.070
 m mode is manual mode 

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:09.720
 and this is the aperture priority and mode with this 

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:14.300
 shutter priority 

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:18.900
 Foam can be called MA 

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:22.310
 life in essence is the same thing on 

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:29.720
 called simply different in different 

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:29.720
 companies and now we move on to the exposure
