lats but it should be just one fluid
movement<00:02:30.470> like<00:02:30.799> that<00:02:31.069> we're<00:02:31.340> just<00:02:32.200> you<00:02:33.200> can

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
movement like that we're just you can

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.949 
movement like that we're just you can
you<00:02:34.049> can<00:02:34.200> tell<00:02:34.409> that<00:02:34.709> slowed<00:02:34.920> it<00:02:35.040> down<00:02:35.930> how<00:02:36.930> I

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
you can tell that slowed it down how I

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:39.589 
you can tell that slowed it down how I
was<00:02:37.200> engaging<00:02:37.530> the<00:02:37.920> lats<00:02:38.269> after<00:02:39.269> pulling<00:02:39.480> the

00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:39.599 
was engaging the lats after pulling the

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:41.690 
was engaging the lats after pulling the
shoulders<00:02:40.049> down<00:02:40.230> but<00:02:41.040> you<00:02:41.310> don't<00:02:41.430> have<00:02:41.519> to<00:02:41.610> do

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
shoulders down but you don't have to do

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.550 
shoulders down but you don't have to do
it<00:02:41.730> that<00:02:41.970> slow<00:02:42.299> I'm<00:02:42.720> just<00:02:42.989> doing<00:02:43.260> it<00:02:43.349> for<00:02:43.439> the

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
it that slow I'm just doing it for the

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.250 
it that slow I'm just doing it for the
sake<00:02:43.829> sake<00:02:44.310> of<00:02:44.430> the<00:02:44.489> example<00:02:44.959> now<00:02:45.959> there<00:02:46.200> are

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
sake sake of the example now there are

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.110 
sake sake of the example now there are
many<00:02:46.409> ways<00:02:46.620> people<00:02:46.950> do<00:02:47.069> it<00:02:47.220> wrong<00:02:47.280> and<00:02:47.909> I'm

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
many ways people do it wrong and I'm

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:55.110 
many ways people do it wrong and I'm
about<00:02:48.269> to<00:02:48.390> show<00:02:48.569> you<00:02:48.599> that<00:02:48.930> right<00:02:49.739> here

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.300 

this<00:02:56.120> is<00:02:56.300> the<00:02:56.420> way<00:02:56.540> many<00:02:57.050> people<00:02:57.380> do<00:02:57.560> it<00:02:57.709> they

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310 
this is the way many people do it they

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:00.670 
this is the way many people do it they
just<00:02:58.340> yank<00:02:59.000> and<00:02:59.270> pull<00:02:59.599> and<00:02:59.930> they<00:03:00.050> use<00:03:00.260> every

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
just yank and pull and they use every

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.040 
just yank and pull and they use every
muscle<00:03:00.920> except<00:03:01.459> for<00:03:01.610> their<00:03:01.730> lats<00:03:01.940> to<00:03:02.090> to<00:03:02.870> get

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:03.050 
muscle except for their lats to to get

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:06.280 
muscle except for their lats to to get
the<00:03:03.170> weight<00:03:03.349> up<00:03:03.560> and<00:03:04.540> that's<00:03:05.540> fine<00:03:05.959> if<00:03:06.260> you

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
the weight up and that's fine if you

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:08.440 
the weight up and that's fine if you
want<00:03:06.560> to<00:03:06.620> hurt<00:03:06.800> yourself<00:03:07.250> and<00:03:07.580> you<00:03:08.030> want<00:03:08.300> to
