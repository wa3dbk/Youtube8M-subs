00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
and the reason that I got a straw one

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.560 
and the reason that I got a straw one
instead<00:01:14.159> of<00:01:14.250> styrofoam<00:01:14.520> is<00:01:15.030> because<00:01:15.390> it<00:01:15.479> was

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
instead of styrofoam is because it was

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.480 
instead of styrofoam is because it was
like<00:01:15.690> half<00:01:16.140> the<00:01:16.350> price<00:01:16.590> you<00:01:16.979> can<00:01:17.130> do<00:01:17.250> either

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
like half the price you can do either

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.700 
like half the price you can do either
one<00:01:17.700> I<00:01:18.690> thought<00:01:19.020> this<00:01:19.170> drawing<00:01:19.409> one<00:01:19.500> worked

cone form and then you're just going to

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.130
