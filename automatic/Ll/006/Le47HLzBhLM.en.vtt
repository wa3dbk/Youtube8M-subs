00:04:50.999 --> 00:04:51.009 
another half to get just one it's not a

00:04:51.009 --> 00:04:53.100 
another half to get just one it's not a
problem<00:04:51.339> if<00:04:51.669> you<00:04:51.789> don't<00:04:51.969> have<00:04:52.240> a<00:04:52.270> big<00:04:52.659> sardine

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:53.110 
problem if you don't have a big sardine

00:04:53.110 --> 00:05:00.410 
problem if you don't have a big sardine
you<00:04:53.319> know<00:04:55.199> okay

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:00.420 

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:05.429

00:05:09.749 --> 00:05:09.759 
on high heat of course

00:05:09.759 --> 00:05:12.159 
on high heat of course
because<00:05:10.759> our<00:05:10.939> penis<00:05:11.240> will<00:05:11.419> not<00:05:11.599> take<00:05:11.809> too<00:05:12.020> much

00:05:12.159 --> 00:05:12.169
