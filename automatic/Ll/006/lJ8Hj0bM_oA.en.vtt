00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:12.240
 in our live section of the law 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.010
 we help you better understand your 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.049
 rights are you wondering if it's worth the 

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:17.610
 shot to challenge a pv or you have 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.310
 just need a legal opinion 

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:22.590
 to answer it we made an appointment 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.520
 you with a lawyer specializing in 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.520
 the Highway Code 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.850
 at first it's a good thing 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.250
 6 there are some pv they are a little 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.140
 excessive so we are still limited 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.270
 the number of dead on the road 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.550
 not since after well following an opinion 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.470
 ticket received by mail for 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.570
 a grilled red light I asked 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:47.879
 to receive the pictures not having at all 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.280
 remember these facts it turns out that 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.160
 in the photographs it is impossible 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.510
 to notice this offense 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:56.879
 impossible to distinguish the 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.129
 true hard fire color too 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.869
 to recognize my car so I have 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.909
 not want to pay for a 

00:01:00.869 --> 00:01:04.589
 offense I can not be sure 

00:01:02.909 --> 00:01:06.420
 that it was indeed committed 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.000
 it seems to me the least of things when 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.190
 even what do you think of jean-luc from 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.630
 grenoble then if we do not see anything and 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:14.189
 especially if there is no proof that 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.640
 you have actually crossed a fire 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.380
 road 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.540
 it is imperative to file a 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.430
 Claim to access the 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.960
 judges and to go explain your 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.850
 problem to the latter 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.560
 yes indeed if the clichés do not 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.780
 does not prove that you are the author of 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.610
 the offense a priori we can not 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.110
 you criticized that's right because 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.700
 that finally it's a machine that 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.190
 find the offense if the offense 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.440
 is not at all fine is not at all 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:39.240
 possible to see it is the relaxe 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:41.220
 total I want to say ie 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.050
 without penalty without withdrawal of 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.270
 must follow this is it yes 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:47.220
 actually that's it since 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.530
 when there is no arrest 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.720
 the finding of the offense in fact 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.240
 is directly related to the clichés that is 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.520
 produced by the police and 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.720
 by the floor when there is a 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.450
 court hearing 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:02.610
 and so these are so based on these 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.720
 clichés that eventually you can 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.770
 get into convictment so 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.570
 if they are not exploitable 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.390
 the court will obviously have to 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:11.039
 relax then is that really the 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:14.459
 court in first instance is what 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:16.170
 it happens to him to relax just in 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:17.610
 showing his snapshots that are 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:17.940
 unexploitable is what really 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:19.890
 come 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.810
 yes that happens then the jurisdiction of 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:24.060
 proximity seized by this type of de 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.500
 worries there precisely can relax 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.190
 now tell you it's obvious 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.989
 get some 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:29.310
 not necessarily but if you ever 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:30.060
 do not get in your way 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.860
 always the choice 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.200
 possibly if you are sentenced to 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:37.200
 a fine of more than 150 euros to make 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.849
 call or failing that if it is less than 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.019
 150 euros or 150 euros to make a 

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:41.500
 appeal in cassation in this case 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:43.630
 we have been 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:45.490
 - of all the cases in us 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:47.710
 moving in the courts of judges 

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:50.200
 who completely relaxes judges who 

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:52.180
 imposes a pecuniary fine without 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:54.100
 this does not result in a withdrawal of 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:56.500
 points or even judges who 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:58.240
 condemn penally involving the bel 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:00.030
 and a withdrawal of four points per 

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:02.170
 following that the owner 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:04.120
 contestants demonstrates that the infringement 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:06.070
 is not characterized the photos 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.470
 in other words the only documents to 

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:10.000
 serve as a basis for prosecutions in the 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:12.130
 part of these red light radars do not 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.020
 allowing to verify that the 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:16.209
 vehicle has crossed the crossroads 

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:18.430
 red, but for the least 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:20.190
 justified photos that do not prove 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:22.720
 nothing is not so 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:24.670
 exceptional we have witnessed 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:27.100
 many times lately and 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:29.140
 this particular concerned one of the radars 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:30.340
 red lights the most flasheur of France 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:32.440
 located in paris 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:34.480
 at the crossing of the quai de gesvres and 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:36.040
 St. Martin Street It turns out that 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:38.080
 in one case it is 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:40.959
 precisely from a master tichit customer 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:43.300
 relaxed entirely to the courts of appeal 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:45.310
 like that sometimes do not hesitate 

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:48.000
 insisted after a disappointment in 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:48.000
 first case
