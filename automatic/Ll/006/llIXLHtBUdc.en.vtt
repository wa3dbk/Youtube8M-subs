because<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:47.760> faster<00:00:48.210> you<00:00:48.300> kill<00:00:48.539> them<00:00:48.750> you<00:00:49.110> can

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
because the faster you kill them you can

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.410 
because the faster you kill them you can
control<00:00:49.649> the<00:00:49.829> spawn<00:00:50.129> right<00:00:50.340> almost<00:00:50.700> and<00:00:51.090> this

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
control the spawn right almost and this

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.450 
control the spawn right almost and this
one<00:00:51.660> rank<00:00:51.840> it's<00:00:51.989> really<00:00:52.500> rapid<00:00:52.980> as<00:00:53.129> you<00:00:53.340> can

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
one rank it's really rapid as you can

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:54.850 
one rank it's really rapid as you can
see<00:00:53.670> how<00:00:53.820> many<00:00:53.969> dead<00:00:54.120> bodies<00:00:54.300> on<00:00:54.690> the<00:00:54.780> ground

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:54.860 
see how many dead bodies on the ground

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:57.260 
see how many dead bodies on the ground
so<00:00:55.860> just<00:00:56.100> really<00:00:56.280> speeds<00:00:56.640> up<00:00:56.730> the<00:00:56.910> farming

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
so just really speeds up the farming

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.220 
so just really speeds up the farming
process<00:00:58.550> you're<00:00:59.550> going<00:00:59.670> to<00:00:59.730> obviously<00:01:00.239> want
