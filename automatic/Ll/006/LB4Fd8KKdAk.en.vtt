range<00:00:39.450> in<00:00:39.600> mine<00:00:39.750> warfare<00:00:39.900> 3<00:00:40.320> so<00:00:40.740> I<00:00:41.130> don't<00:00:41.490> know

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
range in mine warfare 3 so I don't know

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.540 
range in mine warfare 3 so I don't know
I<00:00:41.760> like<00:00:42.150> it<00:00:42.330> in<00:00:42.900> for<00:00:43.200> grip<00:00:43.410> just<00:00:44.010> to<00:00:44.340> increase

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
I like it in for grip just to increase

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:45.650 
I like it in for grip just to increase
its<00:00:44.820> actually<00:00:45.210> a<00:00:45.240> little<00:00:45.329> bit<00:00:45.510> on<00:00:45.630> that

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
its actually a little bit on that

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.300 
its actually a little bit on that
because<00:00:45.990> the<00:00:46.200> gun<00:00:46.410> jumps<00:00:46.950> around<00:00:47.070> a<00:00:47.220> little

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:47.310 
because the gun jumps around a little

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:51.560 
because the gun jumps around a little
bit<00:00:47.460> so<00:00:47.940> I<00:00:49.310> moving<00:00:50.310> on<00:00:50.640> to<00:00:51.120> the<00:00:51.150> next<00:00:51.270> class

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
bit so I moving on to the next class

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.960 
bit so I moving on to the next class
msmc<00:00:52.170> i<00:00:52.620> have<00:00:52.800> long<00:00:53.010> barrel<00:00:53.250> on<00:00:53.370> it<00:00:53.400> again<00:00:53.610> but

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:53.970 
msmc i have long barrel on it again but

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:56.960 
msmc i have long barrel on it again but
this<00:00:54.030> time<00:00:54.150> i'm<00:00:54.480> using<00:00:54.840> fast<00:00:55.140> mag<00:00:55.380> I<00:00:55.970> tried

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:56.970 
this time i'm using fast mag I tried

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:59.990 
this time i'm using fast mag I tried
extended<00:00:57.810> mag<00:00:57.960> on<00:00:58.140> it<00:00:58.320> and<00:00:58.500> I<00:00:59.250> think<00:00:59.520> I<00:00:59.730> like

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
extended mag on it and I think I like

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.660 
extended mag on it and I think I like
fast<00:01:00.239> mag<00:01:00.450> more<00:01:00.800> it's<00:01:01.800> more<00:01:01.950> useful<00:01:02.220> in

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
fast mag more it's more useful in

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.759 
fast mag more it's more useful in
situations<00:01:02.970> where<00:01:03.930> you<00:01:03.960> can<00:01:04.110> reload<00:01:04.439> quicker

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
situations where you can reload quicker

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.210 
situations where you can reload quicker
instead<00:01:05.729> of<00:01:05.850> just<00:01:05.970> having<00:01:06.120> 10<00:01:06.540> extra<00:01:06.780> bullets

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:07.220 
instead of just having 10 extra bullets

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.040 
instead of just having 10 extra bullets
and<00:01:08.220> then<00:01:09.000> having<00:01:09.180> to<00:01:09.300> take<00:01:09.510> the<00:01:09.720> time<00:01:09.900> to

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:10.050 
and then having to take the time to

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:11.630 
and then having to take the time to
reload<00:01:10.320> so<00:01:10.530> I<00:01:10.560> like<00:01:10.770> that<00:01:10.890> better<00:01:11.010> well<00:01:11.490> the

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
reload so I like that better well the

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.450 
reload so I like that better well the
next<00:01:11.760> one<00:01:12.000> is<00:01:12.030> mp7<00:01:12.750> with<00:01:13.110> suppressor<00:01:13.800> and<00:01:14.040> fast

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
maps I like to run a route where maybe I

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:37.730 
maps I like to run a route where maybe I
jump<00:01:36.479> over<00:01:36.540> while<00:01:36.840> I<00:01:36.869> jump<00:01:37.110> on<00:01:37.200> some<00:01:37.350> boxes
