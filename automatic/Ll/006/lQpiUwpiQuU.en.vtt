00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.250
 important area under many points of 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:08.970
 view from a geological point of view 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:11.820
 we are in a very abundant area of 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:14.519
 fossils from 3 million years ago 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:17.940
 here it was sea you know the cartridge what 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:20.580
 great upheavals have taken place and 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:23.750
 these dolomites emerged from these 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:27.930
 our beautiful mountains that risk 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:31.890
 during dd d years of decades la 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:36.840
 disintegration are like decayed teeth 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:38.910
 they are like teeth of old people i 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.370
 factors we are not investigating them here i 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:44.370
 guys because so much useless that says about 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:47.480
 supersonic aircraft that is nature there 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:50.399
 I'll give an example, meanwhile, I bring 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:53.039
 the uniform that led to my grandfather who 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:56.309
 are of South Tyrolean origin by 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.910
 father and of Valtellina origin by 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.239
 of mother 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:02.640
 this small coat of arms has been there 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:06.090
 says the mother who is always alive 93 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:08.310
 years conceived in the mountains at 2,000 meters 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:11.490
 so if you couldn't get out anything else 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:15.659
 that so the head hard as the company 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:18.270
 including with exact bresaola width 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:20.659
 the mother spending her a photo of Mom 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:25.020
 well the mirror on an effect 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:26.670
 here is this beautiful of the myths 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:31.200
 there is still a large presence of 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:32.189
 fossils but above all there are many 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.350
 decent 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:37.920
 one for all this that we see of 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:40.470
 in front of the tofana di rozes 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:45.869
 in military terms it was the first tofana 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:48.959
 because behind is the scam we are 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:53.459
 in the Ladin speaking area up here 

00:01:48.959 --> 00:01:57.119
 to 1918 it was austria and above all it was 

00:01:53.459 --> 00:01:59.219
 princely tyrol county of Tyrol up 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:02.429
 road data 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:05.610
 the tyrol was unique to us people at 12 

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:08.129
 years currently from two kilometers 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:10.910
 more sides later and the road of dolomiti e 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:13.950
 autonomous province of bolzano alto adige 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:17.040
 südtirol was all unique you know that i 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:19.560
 important language groups in the Tyrol 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:22.049
 not in a political sense but in a sense 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.180
 numeric were the language group 

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:28.040
 Germanic Italian language group 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:30.150
 the Ladin language group and after ever 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.639
 forget the poor group of 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:35.970
 Cimbrian language machine plateau of the six 

00:02:32.639 --> 00:02:38.069
 municipalities that have almost extinguished the ridge 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:41.700
 languages ​​almost to know from 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:44.220
 but state indifference was a German 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:46.500
 I belong to two thousand years ago 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:48.650
 of the Cimbrian cultural institute why 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.940
 I think the languages ​​are ours 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:54.269
 traditions you have as a language 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:56.849
 Friulan is a language is not a dialect 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:58.859
 so I care, I'm in love 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:01.650
 of your areas I know very well 

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:04.799
 the high Valcanale I have many friends 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:06.720
 we cooperate with them for the recovery of 

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:09.480
 what is historical memory 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:11.700
 I am in Austrian uniform but I am 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.420
 really super partes and there 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.819
 prove 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:18.270
 because my specialization is the 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:20.640
 mountain war of the Alpini only one 

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:22.470
 small thing part tonight i hope you 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:24.000
 will like what these of rai 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.650
 they did it because we have them 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.110
 we did a head and a back 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:29.880
 so not to say another because I have them 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:32.640
 get mad a little everywhere no 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:35.280
 but I hope they understand what it is 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:37.610
 This was the first world war that 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:40.880
 our stupendous dolomites heritage 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:42.959
 of humanity have always known 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:45.690
 populations from both sides 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:50.670
 of the border they lived in complete 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:55.049
 harmony the mountain lords is the same for 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:57.360
 everyone miss the exact mountain who said 

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:59.940
 that the mountains were natural boundaries 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:02.340
 he was not a mountain man and did not understand 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:05.489
 nothing the poverty was equal from the gang 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:08.160
 beyond and the band here and there is also 

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:09.810
 a very interesting social discourse 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:12.180
 anthropological of that first war 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:14.459
 world that I the small claim of 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:16.829
 having pulled out and someone gave me 

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:19.200
 reason for what we are experiencing 

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:22.789
 today with tourism as well as we talked about 

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:28.669
 legends tofana what tofana means or 

00:04:22.789 --> 00:04:31.950
 fanis that is in the ancient Ladin dialect 

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:34.169
 the throne I say who was with 

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:36.930
 in the Germanic joy the god of gods 

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:38.970
 lightning and it's true because on this it's a 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:41.310
 mountain spy still download today 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:45.050
 when does bad weather more lightning 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:48.740
 that from all other parts it is true that 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:48.740
 at the beginning of hostilities 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:55.229
 italy and austria you know well 24 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:57.330
 May 1915 

00:04:55.229 --> 00:05:00.750
 but here the war started at 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:03.620
 operations a little later 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:05.870
 the Italian army was 

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:08.900
 prepared at this point of this 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:12.290
 despite the Italian soldiers have 

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:15.490
 fought with a sense of duty and 

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:19.510
 unparalleled self-denial looking ever 

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:23.000
 never any army so bad 

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:26.419
 equipped so poorly controlled i 

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:29.180
 top vertices we have of cadorna would have 

00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:32.870
 did what the soldiers did 

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:35.570
 Italians then want is something there 

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:37.669
 a myth that must be reduced 

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:39.740
 i'm sorry because i'm alpine alike 

00:05:37.669 --> 00:05:41.840
 of you will be and that of some 

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:43.669
 the Alpini at 1 to 5 percent 

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:46.610
 of the Italian army 

00:05:43.669 --> 00:05:49.639
 here who fought and paid the 

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:52.699
 blood above all was infantry and 

00:05:49.639 --> 00:05:55.180
 which infantry then we move one 

00:05:52.699 --> 00:05:55.180
 moment
