00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:18.030
 and her 

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:21.320
 in the lesson I 

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:21.320
 talking about reality 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:27.010
 Sometimes I would like to be able to translate all my 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:29.890
 feelings on a sheet of paper to 

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:31.960
 say what's inside I swear to you sometimes 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:34.630
 it causes me to cry but I know well that 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:36.880
 with crying nothing will achieve anything 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:39.309
 I would like more than to see my country change 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:43.030
 but this reality seems never going to 

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:44.920
 finishing the situation and plummets to me 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:46.720
 see how unconsciousness increases in 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.610
 people have consciousness in 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:50.710
 they also suffer from glaucoma and they 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:53.020
 they lost the values ​​because they are not 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:55.210
 fashion every day there is more innocent dead 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:57.670
 form the loss the manners no longer 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:59.800
 they exist here they do not give room them seem 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:01.930
 that compete to see who takes more lives 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:04.869
 where the love for sex was infected 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:07.210
 with AIDS there is no way out for so much 

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:09.910
 agony and some have the audacity to say 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:12.670
 what fantasies what irony because 

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:15.220
 for me fantasy was to think that this theme 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:17.380
 some mind would change and I did not know that 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:19.119
 align some sense into him that 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:21.430
 they would remove the bandages and see the 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:23.860
 situation I also sometimes you want 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:26.259
 from country to leave for so many people that 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:27.610
 in the street usually judge me but here I go 

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:29.680
 to stay because I am 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:32.110
 Venezuelan until I bleed in my hands 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:34.090
 for every song written by shouting you 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:36.310
 in the face what the heart screams at me 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:38.470
 like right now I do not plan to stop 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:40.570
 talk about evils like the mediocrity that 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:42.850
 you live in hospitals that treat 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:45.340
 the people as if they were animals and 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:47.050
 after they say calm you live the law 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:49.060
 especially in the hospital and 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:51.520
 central of maracay where they die 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:53.710
 innocent by medical negligence this 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:56.020
 it is something that before our eyes is not seen 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:58.510
 ok but this reality seems some 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:00.670
 they do not see that they are negligent themselves 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:06.400
 ten tickets you feel are capable of 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:08.790
 sell up his ethics also that by seeing 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:12.130
 reality becomes darker 

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:14.950
 corruption a disease without cures a 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:17.800
 city ​​that goes straight to madness and 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:20.190
 true that fills us with bitterness to see 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:23.560
 reality becomes darker 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:26.740
 corruption a disease without cures a 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:29.410
 city ​​that goes straight to madness 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:31.690
 that fills us with bitterness heights 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:34.180
 I have a newborn baby and it touched me 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:36.400
 live the most fucked side of life 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:38.380
 I will give up, the 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.660
 future and that the present is past and 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:43.120
 feel frustrated by goals not having 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:45.130
 achieved and dreams not reached by that 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:47.230
 is that I tried hard but already going back to 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:49.690
 issue that concerns us all in this 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:52.060
 class of problems fight and throw him ball 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:54.340
 to see venezuela emerge but how 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:56.430
 We achieve with transculturation 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:59.170
 applaud your daughter when she dances reggaeton 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:01.540
 keeping as it goes to the beat of the 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:04.000
 song then it is all that I copy seeing 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:06.130
 television there is a saying out there that 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.110
 says that nothing is eternal what always 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:09.910
 It has been eternal to blame these governments 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:12.280
 when we were ourselves that 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:14.710
 we create this hell rapes 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:16.930
 prostitution and humiliation is what 

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:19.180
 they scale all the positions do not matter 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:21.370
 economic ones that have nothing will make it 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:24.100
 stop this wave of corruption that we 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:26.020
 they keep it if we do not fight if 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:30.150
 we do not move forward and if when someone speaks 

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:30.150
 the rest of us shut up 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:37.810
 seeing reality becomes darker 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:40.629
 corruption a disease without cures a 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:43.480
 city ​​that goes straight to madness and 

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:45.870
 true that fills us with bitterness to see 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:49.239
 the reality becomes darker 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:52.060
 corruption a disease without a cure 

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:55.660
 city ​​that goes straight to madness and 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:59.549
