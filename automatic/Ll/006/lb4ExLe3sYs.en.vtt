fundamental<00:00:42.980> monetary<00:00:43.980> system<00:00:44.520> you<00:00:44.730> know<00:00:44.879> I

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
fundamental monetary system you know I

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.690 
fundamental monetary system you know I
see<00:00:45.180> gold<00:00:45.390> as<00:00:45.629> money<00:00:45.660> and<00:00:46.230> when<00:00:46.829> gold<00:00:47.399> goes

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
see gold as money and when gold goes

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.670 
see gold as money and when gold goes
down<00:00:47.969> that<00:00:48.000> means<00:00:48.480> the<00:00:48.660> dollar<00:00:48.870> is<00:00:49.170> going<00:00:49.530> up

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
down that means the dollar is going up

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.840 
down that means the dollar is going up
temporarily<00:00:50.539> but<00:00:51.539> long-term<00:00:52.140> the<00:00:53.129> only<00:00:53.579> thing

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
temporarily but long-term the only thing

temporarily but long-term the only thing
that<00:00:54.000> I<00:00:54.030> think<00:00:54.239> is<00:00:54.570> really<00:00:55.020> important<00:00:55.620> is<00:00:55.800> the

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
that I think is really important is the

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.099 
that I think is really important is the
creation<00:00:56.640> of<00:00:56.879> new<00:00:57.059> money<00:00:57.239> and<00:00:57.480> credit<00:00:57.690> and

creation of new money and credit and

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.580 
creation of new money and credit and
nobody<00:00:59.039> is<00:00:59.399> arguing<00:00:59.789> the<00:01:00.210> case<00:01:00.390> that<00:01:00.960> we're

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590

nobody is arguing the case that we're
not<00:01:01.739> doing<00:01:02.129> that<00:01:02.160> the<00:01:03.149> only<00:01:03.329> argument<00:01:03.600> is<00:01:03.989> is

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
not doing that the only argument is is

gold<00:01:42.030> prices<00:01:42.329> don't<00:01:42.720> predict<00:01:43.320> inflation<00:01:43.770> very

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
gold prices don't predict inflation very

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.520 
gold prices don't predict inflation very
well<00:01:44.130> actually<00:01:44.549> I<00:01:45.210> think<00:01:45.329> psychologically<00:01:45.960> it

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
well actually I think psychologically it

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.230 
well actually I think psychologically it
we<00:01:46.829> know<00:01:46.979> what<00:01:47.159> the<00:01:47.430> gold<00:01:47.610> price<00:01:47.670> going<00:01:47.970> down

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
we know what the gold price going down

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.969 
we know what the gold price going down
is<00:01:48.450> not<00:01:48.600> necessarily<00:01:48.899> a<00:01:49.049> bad<00:01:49.409> thing<00:01:49.470> from<00:01:49.829> that

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
is not necessarily a bad thing from that

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.170 
is not necessarily a bad thing from that
perspective<00:01:50.189> it's<00:01:50.579> just<00:01:50.820> people<00:01:50.970> have

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
perspective it's just people have

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.760 
perspective it's just people have
someone<00:01:51.750> more<00:01:51.840> confidence<00:01:52.380> than<00:01:52.439> are<00:01:52.619> less

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
someone more confidence than are less

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.100 
someone more confidence than are less
concerned<00:01:52.890> about<00:01:53.220> really<00:01:53.610> bad<00:01:53.960> outcomes<00:01:54.960> but

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
concerned about really bad outcomes but

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.840 
concerned about really bad outcomes but
let<00:01:55.350> me<00:01:55.380> just<00:01:55.439> end<00:01:55.680> by<00:01:55.829> saying<00:01:55.860> that<00:01:56.369> nobody

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
let me just end by saying that nobody

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.429 
let me just end by saying that nobody
really<00:01:57.210> understands<00:01:57.570> gold<00:01:57.840> prices<00:01:58.049> and<00:01:58.380> I

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
really understands gold prices and I

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.200 
really understands gold prices and I
don't<00:01:58.680> pretend<00:01:59.250> to<00:01:59.430> really<00:01:59.640> understand<00:02:00.030> to<00:02:00.119> me

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
don't pretend to really understand to me

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.969 
don't pretend to really understand to me

to Chairman Bernanke I would say yeah

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.219 
to Chairman Bernanke I would say yeah
you're<00:02:06.060> right<00:02:06.210> it<00:02:06.390> doesn't<00:02:06.570> do<00:02:06.810> a<00:02:06.840> lot<00:02:06.930> of<00:02:07.110> good

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
you're right it doesn't do a lot of good

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.619 
you're right it doesn't do a lot of good
on<00:02:07.560> the<00:02:07.680> short<00:02:07.950> run<00:02:08.160> from<00:02:08.429> day<00:02:08.640> to<00:02:08.700> day<00:02:08.910> on<00:02:09.330> on

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
on the short run from day to day on on

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.630 
on the short run from day to day on on
saying<00:02:09.989> what<00:02:10.140> the<00:02:10.200> gold<00:02:10.440> price<00:02:10.590> is<00:02:11.009> telling<00:02:11.550> us

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
saying what the gold price is telling us

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.190 
saying what the gold price is telling us
but<00:02:12.420> i<00:02:12.450> would<00:02:12.870> still

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
but i would still

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.460 
but i would still
stick<00:02:13.440> to<00:02:13.590> my<00:02:13.739> argument<00:02:14.430> that<00:02:14.700> gold<00:02:15.450> is<00:02:15.870> a<00:02:15.930> real

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
stick to my argument that gold is a real

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.580 
stick to my argument that gold is a real
good<00:02:16.950> long-term<00:02:17.780> identifier<00:02:18.780> on<00:02:18.810> the<00:02:19.200> value

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
good long-term identifier on the value

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.860 
good long-term identifier on the value
of<00:02:19.800> a<00:02:19.950> currency<00:02:20.519> in<00:02:20.970> the<00:02:21.090> value<00:02:21.360> of<00:02:21.450> our<00:02:21.569> dollar

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
of a currency in the value of our dollar

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.690 
of a currency in the value of our dollar
I<00:02:22.230> mean<00:02:22.590> if<00:02:22.709> you<00:02:22.800> look<00:02:22.980> at<00:02:23.069> the<00:02:23.160> hundred<00:02:23.459> years

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
I mean if you look at the hundred years

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.509 
I mean if you look at the hundred years
it's<00:02:23.910> very<00:02:24.120> easy<00:02:24.360> $20<00:02:25.260> up<00:02:25.470> to<00:02:25.650> eighteen

00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:26.519 
it's very easy $20 up to eighteen

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:28.160 
it's very easy $20 up to eighteen
hundred<00:02:26.819> dollars<00:02:27.150> now<00:02:27.360> still<00:02:27.660> thirteen

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
hundred dollars now still thirteen

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:29.720 
hundred dollars now still thirteen
hundred<00:02:28.440> dollars<00:02:28.860> and<00:02:29.099> we're<00:02:29.250> printing<00:02:29.519> money

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
hundred dollars and we're printing money

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:33.710 
hundred dollars and we're printing money
faster<00:02:30.390> than<00:02:30.569> ever<00:02:30.930> and<00:02:31.910> there's<00:02:32.910> pretty<00:02:33.510> good

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
faster than ever and there's pretty good

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.270 
faster than ever and there's pretty good
evidence<00:02:33.840> right<00:02:34.260> now<00:02:34.470> there's<00:02:34.709> a<00:02:34.769> shortage<00:02:35.130> of

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
evidence right now there's a shortage of

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.400 
evidence right now there's a shortage of
physical<00:02:35.760> gold<00:02:36.000> the<00:02:36.269> physical<00:02:36.810> gold<00:02:37.019> market

physical gold the physical gold market

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:39.680 
physical gold the physical gold market
has<00:02:37.530> always<00:02:37.800> been<00:02:37.920> strong<00:02:38.280> and<00:02:38.790> that's<00:02:39.510> going

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
has always been strong and that's going

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.120 
has always been strong and that's going
to<00:02:39.750> continue<00:02:39.959> this<00:02:40.349> is<00:02:40.470> going<00:02:40.620> to<00:02:40.680> be<00:02:40.739> sorted

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
to continue this is going to be sorted

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:43.670 
to continue this is going to be sorted
out<00:02:41.310> and<00:02:41.670> after<00:02:42.629> these<00:02:42.959> Corrections

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
out and after these Corrections

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.009 
out and after these Corrections
sometimes<00:02:44.069> you<00:02:44.220> see<00:02:44.489> an<00:02:44.610> explosion<00:02:45.269> even

00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:46.019 
sometimes you see an explosion even

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:49.339 
sometimes you see an explosion even
though<00:02:46.140> I'm<00:02:46.380> not<00:02:46.440> into<00:02:47.340> being<00:02:48.319> as<00:02:49.319> a

00:02:49.339 --> 00:02:49.349 
though I'm not into being as a

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:52.490 
though I'm not into being as a
technician<00:02:49.890> on<00:02:50.220> gold<00:02:50.549> I<00:02:50.989> suspect<00:02:51.989> that<00:02:52.079> could

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
technician on gold I suspect that could

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.890 
technician on gold I suspect that could
happen<00:02:52.709> but<00:02:53.220> I<00:02:53.430> think<00:02:53.790> long-term<00:02:54.150> you<00:02:54.690> can

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
happen but I think long-term you can

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.710 
happen but I think long-term you can
expect<00:02:55.470> government's<00:02:56.370> not<00:02:56.640> to<00:02:56.849> change<00:02:57.180> we're

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
expect government's not to change we're

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.690 
expect government's not to change we're
going<00:02:57.870> to<00:02:57.930> see<00:02:58.079> more<00:02:58.319> Detroit's<00:02:58.829> eventually

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
going to see more Detroit's eventually

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.210 
going to see more Detroit's eventually
the<00:03:00.599> government<00:03:01.140> of<00:03:01.260> the<00:03:01.290> United<00:03:01.709> States<00:03:01.769> will

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
the government of the United States will

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.309 
the government of the United States will
be<00:03:02.430> somewhat<00:03:03.150> similar<00:03:03.510> to<00:03:03.540> Detroit<00:03:04.170> because

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:04.319 
be somewhat similar to Detroit because

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:06.530 
be somewhat similar to Detroit because
people<00:03:04.799> will<00:03:05.010> give<00:03:05.340> up<00:03:05.519> their<00:03:05.700> confidence<00:03:06.329> in

in the dollar and eventually they'll

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:11.839 
in the dollar and eventually they'll
give<00:03:10.290> up<00:03:10.530> the<00:03:10.620> confidence<00:03:10.860> on<00:03:11.130> our<00:03:11.280> military
