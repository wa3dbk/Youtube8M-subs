00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:36.569
 fun but in the cinema experience what 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.769
 do you think going into the cinema 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:39.750
 we do n't have to change a big one 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:42.120
 hall have imax 3d 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:45.420

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:47.489
 think and I anyway 3d glasses that 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:51.709
 is also about and what i had i was in 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:51.709
 universal studios in america 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:02.250
 Let the steps were 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:04.770
 Life thus just 360 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:06.540
 now off and your real ones are really in the middle 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:08.490
 in the peel in the end that also one 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:09.740
 facebook is only going to insist 

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:12.600
 what do you think of all those big ones 

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:14.910
 blockbusters as transformers 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:17.190
 really only commercially 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:18.240
 money in is only purely for that cashcow 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:20.370
 to milk out 

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:21.990
 it is a shame that you can do it well 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:23.820
 do with you as existing way I do it 

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:27.390
 good can by you can make him out of meppel 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:30.510
 then nice on gate parker who 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:33.360
 kitchen louis with only jack sparrow 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:36.300
 and which had to be was super 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:38.220
 smell my favorites 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:40.500
 then I would also have had four of fresh mold 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:42.720
 what I do notice is that it is 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:43.890
 the less you see the less money in it 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.930
 middle own capital is because 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:49.020
 nowadays so in all blood here so 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:51.750
 much bigger evil you are very broad 

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:55.110
 Formulate you want your phone but stupid 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:56.910
 things come from then a sponge is you 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:58.500
 no longer escapes you should but 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:59.670
 pay attention in the film which brand you notice 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:11.640
 all did not pass 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:13.560
 and then the question better ok and when 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:16.049
 of course watch a movie then you grab 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:18.030
 drinking a bowl of pop choir 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:19.919
 major of the spring mist bank referring to such 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:21.989
 way that indeed so fast 

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:23.100
 should happen 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:24.840
 and the fun is the very first 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:26.790
 episode that the Kelvin had in that 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:28.140
 once put down in top time 

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:30.150
 so the godfather is sitting next to me in that 

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:32.490
 of course there is the importance of this 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:35.310
 and I am, of course, one 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:36.720
 for a while and if I know one better than is 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:39.780
 it could be better 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:43.430
 so we will have these three 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:43.430
