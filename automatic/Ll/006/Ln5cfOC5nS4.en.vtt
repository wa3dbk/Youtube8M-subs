00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.120 

only<00:02:05.840> a<00:02:05.900> quick<00:02:06.110> point<00:02:06.350> here<00:02:06.560> and<00:02:06.770> that<00:02:06.920> is<00:02:07.040> the

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.130 
only a quick point here and that is the

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:08.979 
only a quick point here and that is the
cutting<00:02:07.310> inside<00:02:07.670> see<00:02:08.119> how<00:02:08.209> I'm<00:02:08.360> doing<00:02:08.420> that<00:02:08.750> um

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:08.989 
cutting inside see how I'm doing that um

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:10.900 
cutting inside see how I'm doing that um
the<00:02:09.410> reason<00:02:09.560> I'm<00:02:09.800> doing<00:02:09.860> this<00:02:10.099> again<00:02:10.729> here's

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
the reason I'm doing this again here's

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:13.270 
the reason I'm doing this again here's
an<00:02:11.030> example<00:02:11.300> my<00:02:12.260> team<00:02:12.500> back<00:02:12.739> there<00:02:12.890> was<00:02:13.010> spawn

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
an example my team back there was spawn

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:14.890 
an example my team back there was spawn
trap<00:02:13.580> there's<00:02:13.790> guardians<00:02:14.270> and<00:02:14.510> stuff<00:02:14.810> like

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
trap there's guardians and stuff like

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:16.780 
trap there's guardians and stuff like
that<00:02:14.959> so<00:02:15.260> I'm<00:02:15.590> basically<00:02:15.800> just<00:02:16.099> giving<00:02:16.550> them<00:02:16.670> a

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
that so I'm basically just giving them a

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:18.760 
that so I'm basically just giving them a
break<00:02:17.180> I'm<00:02:17.780> going<00:02:17.959> to<00:02:18.050> get<00:02:18.230> these<00:02:18.410> two<00:02:18.590> guys

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:18.770 
break I'm going to get these two guys

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:20.979 
break I'm going to get these two guys
and<00:02:19.099> then<00:02:19.489> they'll<00:02:19.730> spawn<00:02:19.940> with<00:02:20.180> me<00:02:20.330> so<00:02:20.870> I'm

00:02:20.979 --> 00:02:20.989 
and then they'll spawn with me so I'm

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:22.449 
and then they'll spawn with me so I'm
just<00:02:21.170> helping<00:02:21.350> my<00:02:21.590> team<00:02:21.800> out<00:02:21.920> and<00:02:22.160> getting

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:22.459 
just helping my team out and getting

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:24.220 
just helping my team out and getting
them<00:02:22.580> to<00:02:22.610> regroup<00:02:23.150> and<00:02:23.390> we<00:02:23.720> can<00:02:23.870> attack<00:02:24.200> again

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
them to regroup and we can attack again

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:26.979 
them to regroup and we can attack again
it's<00:02:25.100> a<00:02:25.160> very<00:02:25.310> crucial<00:02:25.790> and<00:02:26.000> helpful<00:02:26.540> move<00:02:26.720> to

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:26.989 
it's a very crucial and helpful move to

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:29.020 
it's a very crucial and helpful move to
make<00:02:27.440> for<00:02:27.590> your<00:02:27.680> team<00:02:27.830> because<00:02:28.160> it<00:02:28.790> allowed<00:02:29.000> us

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
make for your team because it allowed us

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:30.699 
make for your team because it allowed us
to<00:02:29.180> win<00:02:29.390> the<00:02:29.510> game<00:02:29.540> actually<00:02:29.810> if<00:02:30.290> I<00:02:30.530> hadn't

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:30.709 
to win the game actually if I hadn't

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:32.110 
to win the game actually if I hadn't
done<00:02:30.860> that<00:02:30.890> then<00:02:31.160> they<00:02:31.310> would<00:02:31.489> have<00:02:31.519> basically

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
done that then they would have basically

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.080 
done that then they would have basically
got<00:02:32.300> destroyed<00:02:33.220> this<00:02:34.220> class<00:02:34.400> is<00:02:34.430> also<00:02:34.910> useful

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
got destroyed this class is also useful

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:36.940 
got destroyed this class is also useful

some fun the reason I use the
attachments<00:02:40.370> that<00:02:40.400> I<00:02:40.489> have<00:02:40.700> is<00:02:40.880> because<00:02:41.120> first

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
attachments that I have is because first

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:43.150 
attachments that I have is because first
of<00:02:41.840> all<00:02:41.900> suppressor<00:02:42.440> getting<00:02:42.680> a<00:02:42.709> bo<00:02:42.860> staffs

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160 
of all suppressor getting a bo staffs

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:47.759 
of all suppressor getting a bo staffs
radar<00:02:43.519> and<00:02:43.700> the<00:02:45.760> tactical<00:02:46.760> knife<00:02:46.910> is<00:02:47.060> because

00:02:47.759 --> 00:02:47.769 
radar and the tactical knife is because

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:50.559 
radar and the tactical knife is because
you<00:02:48.769> want<00:02:48.980> to<00:02:49.069> be<00:02:49.220> able<00:02:49.400> to<00:02:49.819> have<00:02:50.120> close<00:02:50.360> range

00:02:50.559 --> 00:02:50.569 
you want to be able to have close range

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:52.720 
you want to be able to have close range
combat<00:02:50.660> and<00:02:51.200> when<00:02:51.830> you<00:02:51.890> run<00:02:52.220> out<00:02:52.250> of<00:02:52.400> ammo

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
combat and when you run out of ammo

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:54.160 
combat and when you run out of ammo
because<00:02:52.940> this<00:02:53.060> thing<00:02:53.209> does<00:02:53.360> have<00:02:53.510> local<00:02:53.840> ammo

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.170 
because this thing does have local ammo

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:55.690 
because this thing does have local ammo
capacity<00:02:54.260> you<00:02:55.040> just<00:02:55.160> run<00:02:55.280> up<00:02:55.370> there<00:02:55.459> and<00:02:55.519> get

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
capacity you just run up there and get

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:00.039 
capacity you just run up there and get
them<00:02:57.250> another<00:02:58.250> point<00:02:58.549> is<00:02:58.819> that<00:02:59.360> why<00:02:59.780> wouldn't

00:03:00.039 --> 00:03:00.049 
them another point is that why wouldn't

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:01.539 
them another point is that why wouldn't
I<00:03:00.080> just<00:03:00.260> use<00:03:00.380> an<00:03:00.500> SMG<00:03:00.830> with<00:03:01.069> suppressor<00:03:01.489> and

00:03:01.539 --> 00:03:01.549 
I just use an SMG with suppressor and

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:03.850 
I just use an SMG with suppressor and
later<00:03:01.730> site<00:03:01.940> and<00:03:02.150> that's<00:03:03.140> again<00:03:03.470> because<00:03:03.769> of

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:03.860 
later site and that's again because of

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:05.620

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:05.630 
the close-range combat this thing can be

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:08.349 
the close-range combat this thing can be
pulled<00:03:05.900> up<00:03:06.080> faster<00:03:06.500> than<00:03:06.530> any<00:03:06.799> gun<00:03:07.239> pistols<00:03:08.239> in

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:09.829 
general it's gonna be faster than any

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:12.280 
general it's gonna be faster than any
