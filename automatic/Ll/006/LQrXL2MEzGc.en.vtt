00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:10.650
 oliver one in many german 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.630
 master why master twice 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.089
 world champion and two methods of 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:19.859
 Universe and I'll give you a few 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:24.210
 tips for the right cross in crosses 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:26.630
 a class exercise does not have that 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:30.929
 sometimes not quite as often in 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:33.270
 Gyms because it is uncomfortable and 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.510
 because the successful as well as potential 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.440
 it is dangerous to guess some 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:39.600
 sports scientist and trainer too 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.430
 from this exercise from why, even if 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.700
 you just master them properly 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:47.219
 very good exercise when cruising 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.780
 very important to have such a synchronous one 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.750
 that is, if I have movement now 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.879
 the dish high fog you can see that very much 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.190
 Often it is better to have some 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.739
 then stretched red orders are 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.359
 you would have to do the whole thing relatively simple 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.859
 that protects the back that leads too 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:07.290
 that you can take a higher weight 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:08.490
 from the club handle I would 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.830
 always here a school working handle 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.270
 to prefer 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:13.130
 some make that attack then 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.240
 hold true 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:17.430
 I really would leave that 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.729
 wooden handle then take hold of with a 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.930
 a bit of practice, you hold the rod tight 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:26.009
 The trade can not be that fast either 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:28.350
 slip out of the hand or take it out 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:30.479
 and there are different new ones you can 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.060
 do that with a broad board and very much 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.890
 grab very tight 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.360
 but that is more likely in the yard 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.920
 made if you then listened 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.159
 can occupy and with the upper body 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.880
 must bow because less forward 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:42.470
 Bodybuilding has the most 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.250
 actually 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:47.650
 from classic shoulder two stood 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:49.760
 feet are directed forward 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:52.670
 important also in the exercise you can see 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:54.290
 sometimes sometimes when he squats 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.210
 always looked very nice forward 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:57.590
 the head is placed behind 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:59.960
 not necessarily good for heating 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.820
 So pillar should actually be the head yes 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.760
 if it is somehow in adoration that 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:05.900
 that's what they wanted to say 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:08.570
 Another important thing if I am now 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:10.160
 then I'm at the top of the end of the movement 

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:11.540
 that is done very often that the 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.220
 athletes then lean backwards 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.350
 they bend backwards 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.000
 that led to the short term 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:19.280
 dish two can last longer 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.980
 A certain relief for me is like 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:24.230
 good so please no hyperextension though 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:26.720
 let it be nice and head in 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:29.000
 extension of the spine 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:33.070
 that would be you the most important thing you have 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.070
 on the battlefield on the topic right
