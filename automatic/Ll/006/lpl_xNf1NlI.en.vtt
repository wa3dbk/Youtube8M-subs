in<00:00:08.700> a<00:00:08.760> door<00:00:09.090> and<00:00:09.660> the<00:00:09.750> reason<00:00:10.019> why<00:00:10.080> I'm<00:00:10.170> doing

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230 
in a door and the reason why I'm doing

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:11.930 
in a door and the reason why I'm doing
this<00:00:10.590> is<00:00:10.769> because<00:00:10.889> I<00:00:11.160> think<00:00:11.219> that<00:00:11.429> this<00:00:11.610> is<00:00:11.730> far

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
this is because I think that this is far

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.660 
this is because I think that this is far
superior<00:00:12.179> quality<00:00:13.110> than<00:00:13.620> most<00:00:14.219> of<00:00:14.370> the<00:00:14.460> stuff

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
superior quality than most of the stuff

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.060 
superior quality than most of the stuff
that<00:00:14.849> you<00:00:14.940> can<00:00:15.089> get<00:00:15.210> in<00:00:15.330> hardware<00:00:15.780> stores

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
for that length of time so with no

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.060 
for that length of time so with no
further<00:00:29.189> ado<00:00:29.910> let's<00:00:29.939> get<00:00:30.539> started<00:00:30.779> so<00:00:31.170> this<00:00:31.890> is

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
further ado let's get started so this is

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.580 
further ado let's get started so this is
the<00:00:32.189> tools<00:00:32.460> a<00:00:32.790> pair<00:00:33.149> of<00:00:33.180> channellocks<00:00:33.809> some

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
the tools a pair of channellocks some

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.299 
the tools a pair of channellocks some
metal<00:00:34.950> scissors<00:00:35.370> a<00:00:35.660> hammer<00:00:36.660> two<00:00:37.500> punctures<00:00:37.890> a

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
metal scissors a hammer two punctures a

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.850 
metal scissors a hammer two punctures a
tape<00:00:38.640> measure<00:00:38.940> the<00:00:39.629> spring<00:00:39.930> bronze<00:00:40.290> and<00:00:40.739> a

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
tape measure the spring bronze and a

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.470 
tape measure the spring bronze and a
backing<00:00:41.070> board<00:00:41.370> to<00:00:41.670> punch<00:00:42.000> on<00:00:44.090> so<00:00:45.090> this<00:00:45.239> is<00:00:45.360> the

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
backing board to punch on so this is the

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.330 
backing board to punch on so this is the
old<00:00:45.690> weather<00:00:46.020> stripping<00:00:46.530> and<00:00:46.800> as<00:00:47.039> you<00:00:47.160> can<00:00:47.280> see

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
old weather stripping and as you can see

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.549 
old weather stripping and as you can see
it's<00:00:47.610> not<00:00:47.760> in<00:00:47.879> very<00:00:48.030> good<00:00:48.120> shape<00:00:48.270> and<00:00:48.780> it

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
it's not in very good shape and it

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.290 
it's not in very good shape and it
doesn't<00:00:49.860> seal<00:00:50.070> anymore<00:00:50.489> and<00:00:50.760> it<00:00:50.820> needs<00:00:51.030> to<00:00:51.180> be

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
doesn't seal anymore and it needs to be

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.100 
doesn't seal anymore and it needs to be
removed<00:00:51.449> and<00:00:52.399> the<00:00:53.399> easiest<00:00:54.000> way<00:00:54.449> to<00:00:54.480> remove

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
removed and the easiest way to remove

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.410 
removed and the easiest way to remove
this<00:00:55.379> is<00:00:55.680> to<00:00:55.920> use<00:00:56.070> the<00:00:56.250> pair<00:00:56.460> of<00:00:56.579> channellocks

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
this is to use the pair of channellocks

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.380 
this is to use the pair of channellocks
and<00:00:57.629> you<00:00:57.930> just<00:00:58.170> grab<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:59.219> spring<00:00:59.579> bronze<00:00:59.879> and

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
and you just grab the spring bronze and

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.630 
and you just grab the spring bronze and
ease<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:01.260> nail<00:01:01.500> out<00:01:01.770> using<00:01:02.280> the<00:01:02.370> spring

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
ease the nail out using the spring

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.119 
ease the nail out using the spring
bronze<00:01:02.940> and<00:01:03.899> it<00:01:03.960> goes<00:01:04.140> pretty<00:01:04.320> rapidly<00:01:04.979> you

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
bronze and it goes pretty rapidly you

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:06.980 
bronze and it goes pretty rapidly you
can<00:01:05.280> do<00:01:05.760> a<00:01:05.790> whole<00:01:06.000> door<00:01:06.270> in<00:01:06.420> about<00:01:06.659> ten<00:01:06.960> minutes

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
can do a whole door in about ten minutes

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:14.320 
can do a whole door in about ten minutes
I<00:01:10.070> measure<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.310> door<00:01:12.470> down<00:01:13.470> to<00:01:13.619> the<00:01:13.740> strike

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:14.330 
I measure the door down to the strike

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:19.550 
I measure the door down to the strike
and<00:01:16.490> then<00:01:17.490> if<00:01:17.729> there's<00:01:17.939> any<00:01:18.119> damage<00:01:18.689> spring

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
and then if there's any damage spring

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.200 
and then if there's any damage spring
bronze<00:01:19.970> discard<00:01:20.970> it<00:01:21.180> then<00:01:22.110> measure<00:01:22.950> and<00:01:23.400> cut

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
bronze discard it then measure and cut

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:30.830 
bronze discard it then measure and cut
the<00:01:24.439> spring<00:01:25.439> bronze<00:01:27.229> and<00:01:28.850> I<00:01:29.850> marker<00:01:30.509> the

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
the spring bronze and I marker the

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.810 
the spring bronze and I marker the
distance<00:01:31.229> between<00:01:31.439> the<00:01:31.829> nails<00:01:32.040> is<00:01:32.430> one<00:01:32.640> and<00:01:32.790> a

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
distance between the nails is one and a

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.560 
distance between the nails is one and a
quarter<00:01:33.180> inches<00:01:33.770> and<00:01:34.770> so<00:01:35.520> I<00:01:35.790> mark<00:01:36.150> the<00:01:36.299> spring

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
quarter inches and so I mark the spring

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.330 
quarter inches and so I mark the spring
bronze<00:01:36.810> just<00:01:37.170> to<00:01:37.350> make<00:01:37.500> it<00:01:37.530> easier<00:01:38.040> and

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
bronze just to make it easier and

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.840 
bronze just to make it easier and
because<00:01:39.299> I'm<00:01:39.420> a<00:01:39.479> little<00:01:39.689> bit<00:01:39.810> anal<00:01:40.020> and<00:01:40.850> then

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
because I'm a little bit anal and then

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.389 
because I'm a little bit anal and then
the<00:01:41.970> next<00:01:42.240> step<00:01:42.450> is<00:01:42.630> to<00:01:42.899> punch<00:01:43.229> the<00:01:43.619> holes<00:01:43.860> in

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
the next step is to punch the holes in

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.609 
the next step is to punch the holes in
the<00:01:44.579> spring<00:01:44.850> bronze<00:01:45.090> with<00:01:45.990> the<00:01:46.110> piece<00:01:46.350> going

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
the spring bronze with the piece going

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.130 
the spring bronze with the piece going
at<00:01:46.890> the<00:01:47.009> top<00:01:47.280> I<00:01:47.520> punch<00:01:47.909> all<00:01:48.240> the<00:01:48.450> holes<00:01:48.659> because

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
at the top I punch all the holes because

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.280 
at the top I punch all the holes because
it's<00:01:49.259> hard<00:01:49.470> to<00:01:49.649> punch<00:01:49.920> upside<00:01:50.520> down<00:01:50.899> but<00:01:51.899> with

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
it's hard to punch upside down but with

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.520 
it's hard to punch upside down but with
the<00:01:52.619> sides<00:01:53.579> and<00:01:54.090> the<00:01:54.360> strong<00:01:54.630> side<00:01:54.899> and<00:01:55.290> the

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
the sides and the strong side and the

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.139 
the sides and the strong side and the
straight<00:01:55.829> side<00:01:56.100> I<00:01:56.310> just<00:01:56.490> punched<00:01:56.790> the<00:01:56.909> first

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
straight side I just punched the first

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.870 
straight side I just punched the first
hole<00:01:58.070> so<00:01:59.070> the<00:01:59.159> first<00:01:59.399> step<00:01:59.640> in<00:01:59.759> the

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
hole so the first step in the

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.510 
hole so the first step in the
installation<00:02:00.320> of<00:02:01.320> the<00:02:01.409> spring<00:02:01.680> bronze<00:02:01.979> is<00:02:02.340> to

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
installation of the spring bronze is to

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.130 
installation of the spring bronze is to
put<00:02:02.670> the<00:02:02.820> piece<00:02:03.030> that<00:02:03.299> goes<00:02:03.570> to<00:02:04.049> strike<00:02:04.710> and

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:06.140 
put the piece that goes to strike and

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.169 
put the piece that goes to strike and
this<00:02:07.140> piece<00:02:07.469> should<00:02:07.799> overlap<00:02:08.340> the<00:02:08.550> strike<00:02:08.849> by

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
this piece should overlap the strike by

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:10.850 
this piece should overlap the strike by
about<00:02:09.390> one<00:02:09.599> and<00:02:09.720> a<00:02:09.780> half<00:02:09.810> inches<00:02:10.440> at<00:02:10.709> the<00:02:10.739> top

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
about one and a half inches at the top

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.800 
about one and a half inches at the top
and<00:02:11.310> the<00:02:11.730> bottom

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
and the bottom

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.290 
and the bottom
and<00:02:13.020> you<00:02:13.200> just<00:02:13.410> put<00:02:13.680> in<00:02:13.830> two<00:02:14.160> nails<00:02:14.430> one<00:02:15.000> at<00:02:15.180> the

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
and you just put in two nails one at the

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.870 
and you just put in two nails one at the
top<00:02:15.510> of<00:02:15.750> the<00:02:16.020> strike<00:02:16.860> piece<00:02:17.190> and<00:02:17.520> then<00:02:17.610> one<00:02:17.760> at

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
top of the strike piece and then one at

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.390 
top of the strike piece and then one at
the<00:02:17.970> bottom<00:02:18.150> of<00:02:18.420> the<00:02:18.480> strike<00:02:18.720> piece<00:02:19.400> when

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
the bottom of the strike piece when

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.520 
the bottom of the strike piece when
you're<00:02:20.550> installing<00:02:20.790> your<00:02:21.450> spring<00:02:21.750> bronze<00:02:22.110> is

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
you're installing your spring bronze is

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.590 
you're installing your spring bronze is
spring<00:02:23.340> bronze<00:02:23.550> is<00:02:23.819> going<00:02:23.970> to<00:02:24.030> go<00:02:24.150> all<00:02:24.420> the<00:02:24.450> way

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
spring bronze is going to go all the way

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.870 
spring bronze is going to go all the way
to<00:02:24.780> the<00:02:25.080> strike<00:02:25.440> so<00:02:26.160> then<00:02:26.430> you've<00:02:26.580> got<00:02:26.760> that

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
to the strike so then you've got that

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.900 
to the strike so then you've got that
open<00:02:27.090> overlapping<00:02:27.840> inch<00:02:28.290> and<00:02:28.530> a<00:02:28.560> half<00:02:28.590> so<00:02:29.550> the

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
open overlapping inch and a half so the

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:33.110 
open overlapping inch and a half so the
strike<00:02:30.270> is<00:02:30.510> sealed<00:02:30.840> as<00:02:31.080> well<00:02:31.550> the<00:02:32.550> strike<00:02:32.850> is

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
strike is sealed as well the strike is

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.449 
strike is sealed as well the strike is
actually<00:02:33.480> the<00:02:33.630> hardest<00:02:33.900> part<00:02:34.410> of<00:02:34.680> the<00:02:34.920> door<00:02:35.160> to

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:35.459 
actually the hardest part of the door to

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:38.000 
actually the hardest part of the door to
get<00:02:35.670> sealed<00:02:36.120> so<00:02:36.600> the<00:02:36.810> overlapping<00:02:37.290> is<00:02:37.650> really

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
get sealed so the overlapping is really

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:43.940 
get sealed so the overlapping is really
important<00:02:41.810> after<00:02:42.810> you<00:02:43.110> get<00:02:43.230> your<00:02:43.350> nails<00:02:43.590> in

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
important after you get your nails in

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.550 
important after you get your nails in
you<00:02:44.100> use<00:02:44.310> the<00:02:44.520> punch<00:02:44.730> to<00:02:45.390> get<00:02:45.959> the<00:02:46.080> nails<00:02:46.260> all

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
you use the punch to get the nails all

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.770 
you use the punch to get the nails all
the<00:02:46.680> way<00:02:46.769> in<00:02:46.950> so<00:02:47.160> you<00:02:47.220> don't<00:02:47.250> damage<00:02:47.760> the<00:02:48.420> piece

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
the way in so you don't damage the piece

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:53.930 
the way in so you don't damage the piece
with<00:02:49.170> the<00:02:49.200> hammer<00:02:51.890> now<00:02:52.890> we<00:02:52.950> start<00:02:53.400> putting<00:02:53.790> the

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
with the hammer now we start putting the

00:02:53.940 --> 00:03:00.229 
with the hammer now we start putting the
spring<00:02:54.239> bronze<00:02:54.540> in<00:02:56.510> and<00:02:57.980> what<00:02:58.980> I<00:02:59.010> do<00:02:59.130> is<00:02:59.700> I<00:02:59.910> put

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 
spring bronze in and what I do is I put

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:02.570 
spring bronze in and what I do is I put
the<00:03:00.330> first<00:03:00.569> nail<00:03:00.810> in<00:03:01.200> and<00:03:01.650> then<00:03:01.890> straighten<00:03:02.489> it

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
the first nail in and then straighten it

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:04.820 
the first nail in and then straighten it
out<00:03:02.730> get<00:03:03.090> it<00:03:03.120> in<00:03:03.330> position<00:03:03.480> and<00:03:04.080> then<00:03:04.590> about

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:04.830 
out get it in position and then about

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:07.280 
out get it in position and then about
every<00:03:05.160> eight<00:03:05.370> inches<00:03:05.850> I<00:03:06.180> put<00:03:06.360> another<00:03:06.660> nail<00:03:07.019> in

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
every eight inches I put another nail in

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:10.070 
every eight inches I put another nail in
to<00:03:07.650> position<00:03:07.860> it<00:03:08.370> because<00:03:09.060> once<00:03:09.569> it's<00:03:09.840> in

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:10.080 
to position it because once it's in

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.350 
to position it because once it's in
position<00:03:10.290> it's<00:03:10.950> pretty<00:03:11.340> easy<00:03:11.580> to<00:03:11.760> you<00:03:12.239> know

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
position it's pretty easy to you know

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.809 
position it's pretty easy to you know
just<00:03:12.660> fill<00:03:12.900> in<00:03:13.050> between<00:03:13.230> the<00:03:13.560> blanks<00:03:13.950> but<00:03:14.700> if

00:03:14.809 --> 00:03:14.819 
just fill in between the blanks but if

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:17.630 
just fill in between the blanks but if
you<00:03:14.970> start<00:03:15.330> putting<00:03:16.019> one<00:03:16.410> nail<00:03:16.829> second<00:03:17.489> now<00:03:17.610> a

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
you start putting one nail second now a

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.970 
you start putting one nail second now a
third<00:03:18.030> nail<00:03:18.329> and<00:03:18.660> then<00:03:19.170> it's<00:03:19.380> not<00:03:19.590> in<00:03:19.829> the

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
third nail and then it's not in the

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:21.620 
third nail and then it's not in the
right<00:03:20.100> position<00:03:20.340> it's<00:03:21.030> much<00:03:21.269> more<00:03:21.450> difficult

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
right position it's much more difficult

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:24.759 
right position it's much more difficult
to<00:03:22.019> get<00:03:22.290> it<00:03:22.470> straightened<00:03:23.040> out<00:03:23.310> and<00:03:23.640> sealed<00:03:24.000> so

00:03:24.759 --> 00:03:24.769

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:30.800 
now what I'm doing is I'm filling in the
nails<00:03:28.049> in<00:03:28.530> between<00:03:28.920> the<00:03:29.160> eighth<00:03:29.340> inch<00:03:29.810> nails

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
nails in between the eighth inch nails

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.289 
nails in between the eighth inch nails
that<00:03:31.140> I<00:03:31.200> put<00:03:31.470> in<00:03:31.590> sorry<00:03:32.070> the<00:03:32.280> gaps<00:03:32.549> I'm<00:03:32.970> filling

in the position I want and then I trim
the<00:04:08.880> top<00:04:09.150> piece<00:04:09.510> so<00:04:10.410> there's<00:04:10.890> no<00:04:11.100> conflict<00:04:11.820> in

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
the top piece so there's no conflict in

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.720 
the top piece so there's no conflict in
the<00:04:12.239> corner<00:04:12.690> what<00:04:13.410> you<00:04:13.530> want<00:04:13.769> is<00:04:14.040> that<00:04:14.070> the
