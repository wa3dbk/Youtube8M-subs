00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.680
 Hello everyone and welcome to this new 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.450
 video and in this case I wanted to show you 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.879
 a new feature that brings the 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.530
 whatsapp in its latest version and is that 

00:00:08.879 --> 00:00:13.379
 we will be able to use the 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.759
 WhatsApp and synchronize it in our PC 

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:16.679
 okay 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:19.710
 how to make possible good in this case 

00:00:16.679 --> 00:00:20.759
 whatsapp creates a web page where 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.039
 we will be able to synchronize 

00:00:20.759 --> 00:00:25.679
 our whatsapp from the phone or from 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.839
 our tablet of our device and 

00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:30.900
 we will be able to see this in what 

00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:34.379
 would be on the website well this is 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:37.379
 for what is this google chrome and 

00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:38.609
 firefox and internet explorer then 

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:41.340
 The first thing we have to do is 

00:00:38.609 --> 00:00:42.660
 have the latest version of whatsapp be 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.000
 in our phone our 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.760
 device in this case we can 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.640
 downloading is obviously good for 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.140
 what is android from the google play or 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.059
 we can also download it from the 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.030
 page where we are going to choose the 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:01:00.269
 type of phone we have in what 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.800
 is the brand of the operating system and in 

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:02.930
 this case let's say I do not choose to 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.269
 android 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:07.430
 and here we can download this what 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:09.230
 is the apk in this case to be able 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:12.050
 install it in our our 

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:15.080
 device well once installed then 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:17.180
 then we are going to do the following in 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.680
 our phone here on the same page 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:21.140
 web tells us what we have to do 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:23.180
 we have to open the whatsapp and we have 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:26.750
 that go to the menu and look where the 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:28.130
 this option of whatsapp web well I les 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:30.710
 I'm going to leave an image because I can not 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:33.320
 show him what this is my tablet but 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:35.600
 this one we're basically going to make a video 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:37.520
 I do not open the whatsapp I put the menu and 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:41.119
 we get the option that says whatsapp 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:43.820
 web ok when I press it, it will send me 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:46.220
 to a page or rather to a window 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:48.229
 let's say what the phone is where 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:52.399
 there is going to be a scanner for this code 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:53.840
 of this qr ok then we in this 

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:55.390
 case I here update what is the 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.460
 QR code 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:00.670
 let's focus what the camera of the 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:03.060
 device towards that code and once 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:04.720
 that he gets this is going to be organized 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.600
 automatically what is our 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:10.440
 whatsapp of the phone to what is the 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:12.910
 whatsapp that is here on the pc 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:16.060
 alright then me since I'm connected 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:18.310
 and here what I have this is the same 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:20.590
 that I have in the whatsapp well in this 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:22.790
 case I will send a message we are going to 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:24.829
 put this 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:27.439
 this is one of test let's say I'm 

00:02:24.829 --> 00:02:29.420
 sending a message to myself then 

00:02:27.439 --> 00:02:34.959
 if I write here on the tablet in that 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:34.959
 moment or write this hello to all 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.260
 and sent me we're going to see that 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:42.360
 I was automatically updated in what 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.909
 what is this web page in what is 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:47.700
 in the pc well then we will have the 

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:50.340
 option to be able to be with the 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:52.680
 open window of what whatsapp is 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.599
 in our pc and it will be synchronized 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:57.480
 automatically to what is this our 

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:59.849
 device in some options that 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:03.599
 we have here let's see we have 

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:06.090
 options to see our profile we have 

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:08.790
 the notifications option this does not 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:11.660
 I have tried it well this says it has 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:15.080
 desktop and sound alerts 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:17.270
 let's see can be disabled and in 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:19.280
 this good case has not heard any 

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:21.710
 alert not know what you refer to that 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:23.870
 but there are the ones activated 

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:26.000
 I imagine that later this is going to 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:28.550
 go updating what is this version and 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.400
 is going to be improving well in what 

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:33.440
 it would be good we have the help by the way 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:35.240
 the first time you open it this one 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:37.450
 several visual aids come out the box 

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:41.150
 of these explaining what he does 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:45.380
 we will have the option to send this 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:48.880
 photos of uploading them from our pc by 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:48.880
 example here we are going to select some 

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:55.090
 can be this anybody and there is the logo 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:00.890
 ok here gives us a preview and the 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:02.239
 we can send and automatically this 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:04.819
 I will also have what is the 

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:07.700
 device in what is the tablet 

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:10.060
 ok this we will also be able to take 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:10.060
 Photos 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:15.800
 here in this case I have to learn 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:15.800
 what would you be cam 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:24.049
 I come automatically I'm here I'm 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:24.049
 this take good picture 

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:30.460
 again we take the picture and well there 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:34.680
 is 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:34.680
 and we can send it once 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:40.360
 ok then we can basically do what 

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:42.460
 same as we do from our 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:45.580
 device and we will also be able to 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:48.960
 do in what is this on the pc also 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:48.960
 you can send audio messages 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.160
 hello to all the tutorial friends and 

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:53.160
 plus 

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:58.110
 that in the same way it will be able to load 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:05:00.410
 ok I'll play it here from the 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:00.410
 tablet 

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:07.650
 I do not know if the audio will have been captured but 

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:11.340
 there it sounded ok 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:12.960
 this and good basically this is what 

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:16.050
 we have if the option equals the 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:17.580
 emoticons we can use them and 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:21.540
 well that seems like a pretty idea 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:22.020
 interesting on the good part would be the 

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:24.900
 Whatsapp 

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:26.640
 this because then it will be solved 

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:29.370
 something that many people have wanted to use 

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:32.130
 for some time in which they used 

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:34.380
 emulators this android to be able 

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:35.970
 use whatsapp because now it's not 

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:39.560
 necessary but that the same thing we 

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:39.560
 offers the option well 

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:46.130
 ok here is this is convenient my 

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:47.450
 brother is sending me a message and 

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:49.280
 I'm listening I do not know if I'm 

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:52.880
 aggravating but if they are 

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:55.610
 notifications ok this good then 

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:56.900
 we see that it already works and this if 

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:59.180
 it's being updated because it rang 

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:02.990
 both in what is the computer as 

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:04.250
 in what is this our cell phone ok 

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:06.170
 then that would be all I wanted 

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:09.580
 show them and this would be for this video 

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:09.580
 see you in another next
