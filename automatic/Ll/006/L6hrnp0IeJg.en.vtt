00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:50.300 
unlike the other places it looks quite

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:52.300 
unlike the other places it looks quite
different<00:04:50.360> because<00:04:50.870> it<00:04:51.050> was<00:04:51.139> all<00:04:51.260> rebuilt<00:04:51.680> so

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:52.310 
different because it was all rebuilt so

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:54.400 
different because it was all rebuilt so
it's<00:04:52.639> like<00:04:52.729> rebuilt<00:04:53.419> in<00:04:53.570> Art<00:04:53.900> Nouveau<00:04:54.169> style
