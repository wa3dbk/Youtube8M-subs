00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
just after two where's it got really

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.469

the shadow six thousands i really like
this<00:01:23.880> silhouette<00:01:24.210> and<00:01:24.650> this<00:01:25.650> colorway<00:01:25.979> is

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
this silhouette and this colorway is

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.880 
this silhouette and this colorway is
pretty<00:01:26.640> much<00:01:26.729> a<00:01:26.790> great<00:01:27.119> color<00:01:27.420> way<00:01:27.740> that's<00:01:28.740> why

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
pretty much a great color way that's why

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:29.990 
pretty much a great color way that's why
I<00:01:28.920> picked<00:01:29.100> these<00:01:29.250> up<00:01:29.460> I<00:01:29.610> thought<00:01:29.759> they<00:01:29.939> were

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
I picked these up I thought they were

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.109 
I picked these up I thought they were
really<00:01:30.270> clean<00:01:30.600> and<00:01:30.840> I<00:01:31.290> don't<00:01:31.470> have<00:01:31.680> a<00:01:31.710> lot<00:01:32.009> of

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:32.119 
really clean and I don't have a lot of

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:34.310 
really clean and I don't have a lot of
like<00:01:33.119> running<00:01:33.360> shoes<00:01:33.780> that<00:01:34.049> are<00:01:34.170> this

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
like running shoes that are this

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.830 
like running shoes that are this
colorway<00:01:34.650> I<00:01:34.770> probably<00:01:35.070> have<00:01:35.420> like<00:01:36.420> a<00:01:36.479> front

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
colorway I probably have like a front

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.950 
colorway I probably have like a front
fine<00:01:37.380> it<00:01:37.530> free<00:01:37.829> that's<00:01:38.070> close<00:01:38.369> to<00:01:38.400> this<00:01:38.900> but<00:01:39.900> I

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
fine it free that's close to this but I

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.840 
fine it free that's close to this but I
think<00:01:40.350> this<00:01:40.470> colorway<00:01:40.829> was<00:01:41.100> really<00:01:41.670> really

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
think this colorway was really really

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.319 
think this colorway was really really
sick<00:01:42.210> and<00:01:43.070> this<00:01:44.070> was<00:01:44.369> the<00:01:44.549> shoe<00:01:44.759> I'm<00:01:44.909> talking

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
sick and this was the shoe I'm talking

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:50.210 
sick and this was the shoe I'm talking
about<00:01:46.130> that<00:01:47.130> i<00:01:47.720> had<00:01:48.720> my<00:01:48.930> first<00:01:49.140> saucony<00:01:49.890> here

about that i had my first saucony here

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.120 
about that i had my first saucony here
but<00:01:51.090> it's<00:01:51.240> just<00:01:51.479> way<00:01:51.630> too<00:01:51.689> loose<00:01:52.110> for<00:01:52.170> me<00:01:52.500> I've

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
but it's just way too loose for me I've

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.030 
but it's just way too loose for me I've
wore<00:01:53.460> these<00:01:53.640> probably<00:01:54.030> just<00:01:54.329> a<00:01:54.420> couple<00:01:54.630> times

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:55.040
