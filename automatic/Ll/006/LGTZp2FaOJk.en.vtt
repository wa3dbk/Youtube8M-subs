workshops is doing here the other area
that<00:02:00.060> we're<00:02:00.270> looking<00:02:00.299> at<00:02:00.659> is<00:02:00.869> a<00:02:00.929> combined<00:02:01.409> one

00:02:01.669 --> 00:02:01.679 
that we're looking at is a combined one

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:03.440 
that we're looking at is a combined one
we're<00:02:01.829> looking<00:02:02.070> at<00:02:02.159> customized<00:02:02.670> hydration

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
we're looking at customized hydration

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.149 
we're looking at customized hydration
and<00:02:03.659> strategies<00:02:04.259> to<00:02:04.409> replace<00:02:04.770> all<00:02:05.070> the

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
and strategies to replace all the

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.069 
and strategies to replace all the
electrolytes<00:02:05.670> and<00:02:05.880> fluids<00:02:06.270> that<00:02:06.539> drivers

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
electrolytes and fluids that drivers

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:08.600 
electrolytes and fluids that drivers
will<00:02:07.229> lose<00:02:07.409> during<00:02:07.679> competition<00:02:08.489> and

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
will lose during competition and

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.430 
will lose during competition and
training<00:02:09.030> the<00:02:09.539> other<00:02:09.720> half<00:02:09.929> of<00:02:10.080> that<00:02:10.170> session

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
training the other half of that session

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.680 
training the other half of that session
revolves<00:02:11.250> around<00:02:11.340> body<00:02:11.790> composition<00:02:12.209> and

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
revolves around body composition and

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.320 
revolves around body composition and
body<00:02:13.440> composition<00:02:13.650> is<00:02:14.340> really<00:02:14.400> telling<00:02:15.030> a

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
body composition is really telling a

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:16.970 
body composition is really telling a
driver<00:02:15.810> and<00:02:16.080> athlete<00:02:16.410> what<00:02:16.590> they're<00:02:16.769> made<00:02:16.950> of

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
driver and athlete what they're made of

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.220 
driver and athlete what they're made of
from<00:02:17.640> that<00:02:17.700> we<00:02:18.030> can<00:02:18.209> compare<00:02:18.540> it<00:02:18.569> with<00:02:18.660> healthy

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
from that we can compare it with healthy

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.650 
from that we can compare it with healthy
normal<00:02:19.799> data<00:02:20.040> and<00:02:20.549> also<00:02:20.819> the<00:02:21.000> data<00:02:21.209> from<00:02:21.420> elite

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
normal data and also the data from elite

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.479 
normal data and also the data from elite
drivers<00:02:22.170> but<00:02:22.650> the<00:02:22.680> cattitude<00:02:23.190> drivers

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:23.489 
drivers but the cattitude drivers

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:24.890 
drivers but the cattitude drivers
getting<00:02:23.700> less<00:02:23.880> and<00:02:23.910> less<00:02:24.120> fitness<00:02:24.569> is<00:02:24.690> a<00:02:24.720> big

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
getting less and less fitness is a big

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.500 
getting less and less fitness is a big
element<00:02:25.260> and<00:02:25.790> we're<00:02:26.790> here<00:02:26.970> today<00:02:27.120> to<00:02:27.239> get

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
element and we're here today to get

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.140 
element and we're here today to get
inspired<00:02:27.870> and<00:02:28.140> to<00:02:28.349> show<00:02:29.190> us<00:02:29.250> what<00:02:29.400> to<00:02:29.430> do<00:02:29.610> it's

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
inspired and to show us what to do it's

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:31.640 
inspired and to show us what to do it's
really<00:02:30.420> informative<00:02:30.810> when<00:02:31.110> it<00:02:31.200> comes<00:02:31.380> down<00:02:31.590> to

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
really informative when it comes down to

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:40.819 
really was the Q&amp;A session with mark and
a<00:02:39.360> lot<00:02:39.720> of<00:02:39.780> inspiration<00:02:40.019> for<00:02:40.620> the<00:02:40.709> young

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:40.829 
a lot of inspiration for the young

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:42.710 
a lot of inspiration for the young
drivers<00:02:41.220> I'm<00:02:41.340> sure<00:02:41.549> to<00:02:41.760> see<00:02:41.970> how<00:02:42.480> they<00:02:42.660> can

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
drivers I'm sure to see how they can

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.690 
drivers I'm sure to see how they can
emulate<00:02:43.560> what<00:02:43.920> he's<00:02:44.040> done<00:02:44.220> in<00:02:44.370> his<00:02:44.519> career

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
emulate what he's done in his career

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.729 
emulate what he's done in his career
this<00:02:45.630> is<00:02:45.840> stuff<00:02:46.019> that<00:02:46.049> you're<00:02:46.290> not<00:02:46.319> going<00:02:46.620> to
