00:00:15.109 --> 00:00:21.029
 Only now I'm not going here to sell. 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:24.420
 baked yet another report even more serious 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:26.430
 funny and serves then is the following me 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.699
 I receive many messages 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:33.270
 agriculture entered 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:37.380
 worried because my son, my daughter 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:40.800
 is in the car what do I do? 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:43.890
 thing obvious then the child does not fall 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.980
 you need to take to your dentist 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:49.710
 son or daughter then if you do not read 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.800
 Valcke, if you're going to stay in this 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:55.289
 worry is not solve and I do not know 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.840
 What would be the doubt of the people who arrive 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.520
 to write this right 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:03.030
 I guess you do not know what 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:05.700
 professional raise a slight tip the 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:08.520
 child care provider. 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:12.450
 preferably the pediatric dentist who treats 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:16.290
 exclusively of children also seems to 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:18.930
 an obvious thing because as for example 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:25.640
 a non-professional child who treats 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:28.860
 prostheses blandy surgeries which makes 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:33.750
 and adults the environment is completely 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:36.420
 different then you have seen the articles 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:39.130
 some mentions that the child 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:43.659
 need to receive 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:46.479
 nothing of the 4 of these things is hot 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:49.030
 so the environment while not suitable 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:51.310
 for the child the people with whom he cases 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:54.909
 interesting that so tomorrow I go 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:02:00.970
 want only is the slow child and 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:02:03.670
 border and here I am nothing at the reception 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:05.860
 already speak here not my place 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:08.500
 For god's sake, but do not be afraid. 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:11.769
 I do not want to stay in this place or 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:14.290
 dead or tied then the child 

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:16.900
 young man believed sense already knows this 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:18.940
 the child already realizes that it is no longer the 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.799
 image will be in there. 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:22.599
 but it's worse yet 

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:24.880
 so this will be hopefully a 

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:28.019
 behavior of the child and to be 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:31.090
 aware of all this is also a 

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:32.860
 Professional and approach so I caught 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:36.670
 nicolau always in place 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:40.390
 let's suppose that I learned from several 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:43.900
 types of patient then to a person 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:47.230
 I'm going to make a prosthesis is 11 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:49.480
 young style of see diversity of 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:54.220
 patients does not make the professional 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:57.630
 You can avoid a mood in a 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:59.639
 to be able to dedicate that child 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:02.859
 interesting that I would like to say 

00:02:59.639 --> 00:03:04.930
 often the result that you come from 

00:03:02.859 --> 00:03:07.569
 a child of the world 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:10.239
 It was a job that sometimes to get 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:14.019
 and start working 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:16.060
 we sometimes the one hour 40 minutes 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:16.840
 that child has to enter the 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:20.739
 climate 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:24.340
 you have to have this and it 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:27.370
 The child we play in plays with the 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:31.530
 child feels at ease she makes a 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:31.530
 enormity of things in that environment 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:40.260
 attention never ends at this time slept 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:42.959
 but she has something else so happy 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:45.349
 so relaxed and then the environment 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:48.150
 even if we wanted to demonstrate 

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:51.120
 in this issue of parental trust 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:54.209
 end up helping so if you think of 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:56.370
 send me a message asking if I 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:59.310
 turn a face you make 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:02.069
 remember that we will solve the 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:05.069
 problem now, people with a 

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:08.220
 pediatric dentistry to solve the problem 

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:10.859
 your child's problems and help you in 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:14.280
 from this case forward to 

00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:17.269
 this fall event does not repeat 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:17.269
 good luck
