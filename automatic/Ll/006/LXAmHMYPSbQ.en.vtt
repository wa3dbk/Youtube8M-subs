00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:13.459 

all<00:00:00.989> right<00:00:01.110> we<00:00:01.410> have<00:00:01.530> a<00:00:01.620> rolling<00:00:01.949> chassis<00:00:12.469> yeah

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
all right we have a rolling chassis yeah

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:18.380 
all right we have a rolling chassis yeah
I<00:00:13.500> did<00:00:13.860> by<00:00:14.070> Harbor<00:00:14.460> Freight<00:00:14.639> tires<00:00:14.940> but<00:00:17.150> see<00:00:18.150> I

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
I did by Harbor Freight tires but see I

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:24.710 
I did by Harbor Freight tires but see I
welded<00:00:20.689> the<00:00:21.689> bearings<00:00:22.170> on<00:00:23.090> so<00:00:24.090> I<00:00:24.359> don't<00:00:24.539> think

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
welded the bearings on so I don't think

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:35.240 
welded the bearings on so I don't think
those<00:00:24.960> things<00:00:25.019> are<00:00:25.380> coming<00:00:25.590> apart<00:00:34.070> and<00:00:35.070> this

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
those things are coming apart and this

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.090 
those things are coming apart and this
is<00:00:35.430> not<00:00:36.149> my<00:00:36.300> favorite<00:00:36.480> side<00:00:36.809> just<00:00:37.110> because<00:00:37.500> you

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
is not my favorite side just because you

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.610 
is not my favorite side just because you
know<00:00:38.190> not<00:00:38.550> the<00:00:38.700> best<00:00:38.730> setup<00:00:39.270> for<00:00:39.600> a<00:00:39.629> axle<00:00:40.320> but

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
know not the best setup for a axle but

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.830 
know not the best setup for a axle but
what<00:00:41.309> I<00:00:41.370> did<00:00:41.520> was<00:00:41.670> I<00:00:41.790> went<00:00:42.000> to<00:00:42.090> a<00:00:42.210> tractor

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
what I did was I went to a tractor

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.959 
what I did was I went to a tractor
supply<00:00:43.700> and<00:00:44.700> got<00:00:45.510> some<00:00:45.719> well<00:00:45.930> bond<00:00:46.140> hubs<00:00:46.940> so<00:00:47.940> I

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
supply and got some well bond hubs so I

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.150 
supply and got some well bond hubs so I
got<00:00:48.690> those<00:00:48.899> and<00:00:49.289> then<00:00:49.469> what<00:00:49.590> I<00:00:49.620> did<00:00:49.770> was<00:00:50.510> uh<00:00:51.510> I

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:52.160 
got those and then what I did was uh I

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:57.799 
got those and then what I did was uh I
just<00:00:53.160> um<00:00:53.870> welded<00:00:54.870> a<00:00:55.140> bolt<00:00:55.500> into<00:00:55.829> the<00:00:56.100> hub<00:00:56.809> and

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
just um welded a bolt into the hub and

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.220 
just um welded a bolt into the hub and
then<00:00:58.079> I<00:00:58.410> ran<00:00:59.070> the<00:00:59.219> bolt<00:00:59.460> through<00:00:59.760> the<00:00:59.940> tire

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:00.230 
then I ran the bolt through the tire

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:03.880 
then I ran the bolt through the tire
then<00:01:01.230> I<00:01:01.320> welded<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:01.770> bolt<00:01:02.010> on<00:01:02.250> and<00:01:03.000> I<00:01:03.120> did<00:01:03.329> that

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:03.890 
then I welded the bolt on and I did that

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.230 
then I welded the bolt on and I did that
instead<00:01:04.890> of<00:01:04.979> just<00:01:05.189> bolting<00:01:05.549> the<00:01:05.640> weld<00:01:05.820> on<00:01:06.000> hub

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
instead of just bolting the weld on hub

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.750 
instead of just bolting the weld on hub
directly<00:01:06.689> to<00:01:06.869> it<00:01:08.150> just<00:01:09.150> to<00:01:10.400> support<00:01:11.400> the<00:01:11.549> tire

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
directly to it just to support the tire

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:12.980 
directly to it just to support the tire
better<00:01:12.000> because<00:01:12.299> I<00:01:12.390> think<00:01:12.600> that<00:01:12.750> if<00:01:12.869> I<00:01:12.960> just

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
better because I think that if I just

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.289 
better because I think that if I just
welded<00:01:13.500> the<00:01:13.619> thing<00:01:13.830> on<00:01:14.010> I<00:01:14.280> don't<00:01:15.030> think<00:01:15.240> it

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
welded the thing on I don't think it

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.560 
welded the thing on I don't think it
would<00:01:15.390> have<00:01:15.479> been<00:01:15.509> the<00:01:15.659> best<00:01:15.810> support<00:01:16.290> so<00:01:16.860> I

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:17.570 
would have been the best support so I

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:23.830 
would have been the best support so I
did<00:01:18.570> that<00:01:20.299> smooth<00:01:21.299> down<00:01:21.540> the<00:01:21.750> axle<00:01:22.200> so<00:01:22.950> shiny

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:23.840 
did that smooth down the axle so shiny

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.050 
did that smooth down the axle so shiny
fix<00:01:24.840> my<00:01:25.020> brake<00:01:25.350> let's<00:01:26.130> say<00:01:26.280> crap<00:01:26.580> but<00:01:26.790> it<00:01:26.880> works
