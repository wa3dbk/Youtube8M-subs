00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
to one and then they seed them based on

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.630 
to one and then they seed them based on
whose<00:02:23.700> games<00:02:24.030> lasted<00:02:24.630> the<00:02:25.110> longest<00:02:25.650> or

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
something like that something having to

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.130 
something like that something having to
do<00:02:28.890> with<00:02:28.920> basically<00:02:29.459> how<00:02:30.300> bad<00:02:30.540> did<00:02:30.750> you<00:02:30.810> lose

your<00:02:31.380> third<00:02:31.560> game<00:02:31.800> I<00:02:31.980> think<00:02:32.040> or<00:02:32.550> how<00:02:32.700> fast<00:02:33.030> did

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
your third game I think or how fast did

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:34.940 
your third game I think or how fast did
you<00:02:33.420> win<00:02:33.600> your<00:02:33.630> your<00:02:34.319> first<00:02:34.560> two<00:02:34.770> games

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
you win your your first two games

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:36.890 
you win your your first two games
something<00:02:35.280> like<00:02:35.550> that<00:02:35.760> weird

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
something like that weird

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.210 
something like that weird
so<00:02:37.230> unfortunately<00:02:37.350> those<00:02:37.860> three<00:02:38.069> teams

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
so unfortunately those three teams

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.190 
so unfortunately those three teams
actually<00:02:38.489> get<00:02:38.760> seeded<00:02:39.000> so<00:02:39.209> they<00:02:39.330> all<00:02:39.480> only

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
actually get seeded so they all only

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.470 
actually get seeded so they all only
lost<00:02:40.590> one<00:02:40.890> game<00:02:40.920> but<00:02:41.820> one<00:02:42.000> of<00:02:42.120> them<00:02:42.239> goes<00:02:42.450> to

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
lost one game but one of them goes to

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.199 
lost one game but one of them goes to
the<00:02:42.690> losers<00:02:43.019> bracket<00:02:43.140> that<00:02:43.500> sucks<00:02:44.340> so<00:02:44.850> bad<00:02:45.030> I

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
the losers bracket that sucks so bad I

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:47.030 
the losers bracket that sucks so bad I
hope<00:02:45.390> that's<00:02:45.690> not<00:02:45.780> how<00:02:46.140> it's<00:02:46.320> going<00:02:46.470> but<00:02:46.800> last

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
hope that's not how it's going but last
