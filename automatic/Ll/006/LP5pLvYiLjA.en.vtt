been<00:01:48.479> the<00:01:48.630> FCC<00:01:49.229> that<00:01:49.439> does<00:01:49.649> the<00:01:49.860> approval<00:01:50.369> and

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:51.350 
been the FCC that does the approval and

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:54.590 
been the FCC that does the approval and
the<00:01:52.350> theory<00:01:53.220> itself<00:01:53.490> is<00:01:53.729> not<00:01:53.909> necessarily

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
the theory itself is not necessarily

the theory itself is not necessarily
incorrect<00:01:55.590> of<00:01:55.799> the<00:01:55.950> carriers<00:01:56.399> it's<00:01:56.880> just<00:01:57.119> that

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
incorrect of the carriers it's just that

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.359 
incorrect of the carriers it's just that
they<00:01:57.360> won't<00:01:57.509> have<00:01:57.719> any<00:01:57.869> dialogue<00:01:58.350> with<00:01:58.619> us<00:01:58.829> so

they won't have any dialogue with us so

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.370 
they won't have any dialogue with us so
how<00:01:59.549> can<00:01:59.610> we<00:01:59.880> ever<00:02:00.060> get<00:02:00.329> an<00:02:00.509> amplifier<00:02:01.079> that

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
how can we ever get an amplifier that

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.499 
how can we ever get an amplifier that
