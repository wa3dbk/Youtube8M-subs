can<00:02:36.510> kind<00:02:36.720> of<00:02:36.780> look<00:02:36.990> at<00:02:37.170> the<00:02:37.320> consistency<00:02:37.730> if

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
can kind of look at the consistency if

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:39.980 
can kind of look at the consistency if
you<00:02:38.880> want<00:02:39.090> it<00:02:39.180> thicker<00:02:39.420> you<00:02:39.660> could<00:02:39.810> add<00:02:39.959> more

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:39.990 
you want it thicker you could add more

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:42.530 
you want it thicker you could add more
ice<00:02:40.380> but<00:02:41.130> this<00:02:41.430> is<00:02:41.610> pretty<00:02:41.820> much<00:02:41.970> perfect<00:02:42.240> for

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
ice but this is pretty much perfect for

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.380 
ice but this is pretty much perfect for
me<00:02:42.840> and<00:02:43.340> then<00:02:44.340> you<00:02:44.550> can<00:02:44.700> top<00:02:44.850> it<00:02:45.030> off<00:02:45.150> with<00:02:45.360> a

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
me and then you can top it off with a

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.930 
me and then you can top it off with a
little<00:02:45.570> bit<00:02:45.720> of<00:02:45.810> cinnamon<00:02:46.350> and<00:02:46.640> all<00:02:47.640> of<00:02:47.790> this
