him<00:01:49.240> out<00:01:49.329> he<00:01:49.539> did<00:01:49.719> not<00:01:49.749> look<00:01:50.259> like<00:01:50.469> getting<00:01:50.770> out

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:50.920 
him out he did not look like getting out

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.459 
him out he did not look like getting out
and<00:01:51.159> I<00:01:51.999> thought<00:01:52.240> to<00:01:52.389> myself<00:01:52.509> here<00:01:52.959> this<00:01:53.170> kid's

00:01:53.459 --> 00:01:53.469 
and I thought to myself here this kid's

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:55.529 
and I thought to myself here this kid's
going<00:01:53.709> to<00:01:53.829> get<00:01:53.950> 300<00:01:54.219> easily<00:01:54.909> and<00:01:55.060> I<00:01:55.149> was<00:01:55.329> really

00:01:55.529 --> 00:01:55.539 
going to get 300 easily and I was really

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:57.719 
going to get 300 easily and I was really
disappointed<00:01:55.889> when<00:01:56.889> he<00:01:56.950> didn't<00:01:57.310> because<00:01:57.609> it

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:57.729 
disappointed when he didn't because it

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:00.179 
disappointed when he didn't because it
was<00:01:57.849> such<00:01:58.149> a<00:01:58.179> good<00:01:58.450> innings<00:01:58.810> it<00:01:59.020> deserved<00:01:59.409> 300

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:00.189 
was such a good innings it deserved 300

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:03.330 
was such a good innings it deserved 300
but<00:02:01.119> the<00:02:01.749> thing<00:02:02.020> that<00:02:02.259> stood<00:02:02.529> out<00:02:02.679> to<00:02:02.740> me<00:02:03.009> that

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:03.340 
but the thing that stood out to me that

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:05.129

the thing that stood out brunner hit 38

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:12.960

kept his
kept<00:02:19.599> hitting<00:02:19.900> it<00:02:19.989> into<00:02:20.200> gaps<00:02:20.440> and<00:02:21.209> that<00:02:22.209> was

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
kept hitting it into gaps and that was

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.930 
kept hitting it into gaps and that was
the<00:02:22.629> first<00:02:22.810> yeah<00:02:23.409> I<00:02:23.470> mean<00:02:23.650> I<00:02:23.769> knew<00:02:24.250> before<00:02:24.400> that

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
the first yeah I mean I knew before that

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:26.850 
the first yeah I mean I knew before that
that<00:02:25.150> Lara<00:02:25.540> was<00:02:25.780> a<00:02:25.810> pretty<00:02:26.110> good<00:02:26.290> player<00:02:26.590> but

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
that Lara was a pretty good player but

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:30.660 
that Lara was a pretty good player but
seeing<00:02:27.700> that<00:02:28.170> 277<00:02:29.170> I<00:02:29.290> thought<00:02:29.590> to<00:02:29.739> myself<00:02:29.860> this

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
seeing that 277 I thought to myself this

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:32.550 
seeing that 277 I thought to myself this
is<00:02:30.730> this<00:02:31.180> guy's<00:02:31.390> better<00:02:31.690> than<00:02:31.930> a<00:02:32.019> pretty<00:02:32.349> good

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
is this guy's better than a pretty good

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.740 
is this guy's better than a pretty good
player<00:02:32.799> he's<00:02:33.069> a<00:02:33.190> very<00:02:33.640> very<00:02:33.909> good<00:02:34.060> player<00:02:34.480> and

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
player he's a very very good player and

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:39.150 
player he's a very very good player and
I<00:02:35.910> think<00:02:36.910> the<00:02:37.480> reason<00:02:38.140> why<00:02:38.319> I've<00:02:38.620> always<00:02:38.950> had

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
I think the reason why I've always had

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.610 
I think the reason why I've always had
Brian<00:02:39.700> Lara<00:02:40.000> slightly<00:02:40.690> ahead<00:02:40.780> of<00:02:40.930> such<00:02:41.410> and

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
Brian Lara slightly ahead of such and

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.800 
Brian Lara slightly ahead of such and
tender<00:02:41.950> current<00:02:42.310> and<00:02:42.489> the<00:02:42.549> two<00:02:42.790> great<00:02:43.360> batsman

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
tender current and the two great batsman

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:46.410 
tender current and the two great batsman
of<00:02:43.900> their<00:02:44.080> era<00:02:44.410> and<00:02:44.830> the<00:02:45.610> reason<00:02:46.000> for<00:02:46.120> that<00:02:46.239> is

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
of their era and the reason for that is

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:49.110 
of their era and the reason for that is
I<00:02:46.450> guess<00:02:47.049> I<00:02:47.230> loved<00:02:47.560> the<00:02:47.709> way<00:02:47.860> that<00:02:47.890> Lara<00:02:48.790> played

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
I guess I loved the way that Lara played

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.660 
I guess I loved the way that Lara played
spin<00:02:49.390> bowling<00:02:49.659> the<00:02:50.319> way<00:02:50.530> used<00:02:50.920> his<00:02:51.129> feet<00:02:51.430> the

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 
spin bowling the way used his feet the

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:55.470 
spin bowling the way used his feet the
way<00:02:51.849> placed<00:02:52.269> the<00:02:52.510> ball<00:02:53.459> yeah<00:02:54.459> I<00:02:54.489> guess<00:02:55.269> because

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
way placed the ball yeah I guess because

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.240 
way placed the ball yeah I guess because
I<00:02:55.750> enjoyed<00:02:56.110> playing<00:02:56.349> spin<00:02:56.709> bowling<00:02:56.920> a<00:02:57.099> lot

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
I enjoyed playing spin bowling a lot

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:00.030 
I enjoyed playing spin bowling a lot
myself<00:02:57.430> that<00:02:58.120> I<00:02:58.359> just<00:02:58.930> enjoyed<00:02:59.349> watching<00:02:59.620> Lara

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040 
myself that I just enjoyed watching Lara
