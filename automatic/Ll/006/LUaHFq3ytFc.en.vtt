by<00:00:20.550> it<00:00:20.609> and<00:00:21.439> I<00:00:22.439> didn't<00:00:22.800> notice<00:00:23.010> that<00:00:23.189> it<00:00:23.580> was<00:00:23.670> in

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
by it and I didn't notice that it was in

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.460 
by it and I didn't notice that it was in
one<00:00:23.880> of<00:00:23.939> my<00:00:24.090> nights<00:00:24.359> so<00:00:24.840> when<00:00:25.019> it's<00:00:25.170> like<00:00:25.320> a

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
one of my nights so when it's like a

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.070 
one of my nights so when it's like a
100-year<00:00:26.039> night<00:00:26.279> so<00:00:26.490> you<00:00:26.550> can't<00:00:26.849> use<00:00:27.090> them<00:00:27.900> and

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
100-year night so you can't use them and

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.259 
100-year night so you can't use them and
I<00:00:28.560> never<00:00:29.010> put<00:00:29.250> it<00:00:29.279> as<00:00:29.460> one<00:00:29.640> of<00:00:29.670> my<00:00:29.789> armors<00:00:30.119> like

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
I never put it as one of my armors like

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.080 
I never put it as one of my armors like
on<00:00:30.420> my<00:00:30.539> night<00:00:30.750> and<00:00:30.990> this<00:00:31.140> time<00:00:31.380> I<00:00:31.619> was<00:00:32.489> like

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
on my night and this time I was like

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.770 
on my night and this time I was like
battling<00:00:33.540> something<00:00:33.840> so<00:00:34.520> automatically<00:00:35.780> it

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
battling something so automatically it

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.650 
battling something so automatically it
was<00:00:36.930> put<00:00:37.140> into<00:00:37.290> this<00:00:37.620> guy<00:00:37.860> and<00:00:38.850> I<00:00:39.180> didn't<00:00:39.540> know

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
was put into this guy and I didn't know

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.500 
was put into this guy and I didn't know
so<00:00:40.370> that's<00:00:41.370> the<00:00:41.579> reason<00:00:41.610> I<00:00:41.940> couldn't<00:00:42.149> find<00:00:42.420> it

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
so that's the reason I couldn't find it

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:43.819 
so that's the reason I couldn't find it
out<00:00:42.629> like<00:00:42.780> I<00:00:42.899> can't<00:00:43.110> believe<00:00:43.230> it<00:00:43.440> I<00:00:43.559> have<00:00:43.680> to
