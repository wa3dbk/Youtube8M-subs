00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
heard a lot and seen after doing a

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.580 
heard a lot and seen after doing a
little<00:00:23.850> bit<00:00:23.970> of<00:00:24.000> research<00:00:24.330> is<00:00:24.630> that<00:00:24.689> on<00:00:25.470> the

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
little bit of research is that on the

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.740 
little bit of research is that on the
third<00:00:25.800> of<00:00:25.949> half<00:00:26.130> fire<00:00:26.430> that's<00:00:27.420> the<00:00:27.539> month

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
third of half fire that's the month

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.589 
third of half fire that's the month
there's<00:00:28.740> a<00:00:28.800> holiday<00:00:29.220> which<00:00:29.550> is<00:00:29.789> tails<00:00:30.269> and

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
there's a holiday which is tails and

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.500 
there's a holiday which is tails and
Talos<00:00:31.019> holiday<00:00:31.640> and<00:00:32.640> during<00:00:33.120> this<00:00:33.270> they

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
Talos holiday and during this they

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.680 
Talos holiday and during this they
celebrate<00:00:34.020> necromancy<00:00:35.000> and<00:00:36.000> a<00:00:36.300> lot<00:00:36.450> of<00:00:36.480> people

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
celebrate necromancy and a lot of people

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.119 
celebrate necromancy and a lot of people
tend<00:00:37.170> to<00:00:37.200> stay<00:00:37.350> off<00:00:37.440> the<00:00:37.590> streets<00:00:37.649> at<00:00:37.980> this

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
tend to stay off the streets at this

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.049 
tend to stay off the streets at this
time<00:00:38.399> so<00:00:39.680> just<00:00:40.680> another<00:00:40.920> speculation<00:00:41.670> really

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
time so just another speculation really

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.229 
time so just another speculation really
we<00:00:42.210> could<00:00:42.420> see<00:00:43.020> some<00:00:43.050> kind<00:00:43.590> of<00:00:43.710> Halloween

00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:44.239 
we could see some kind of Halloween

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:47.479 
we could see some kind of Halloween
orientated<00:00:45.239> Skyrim<00:00:45.840> DLC<00:00:46.379> so<00:00:47.070> this<00:00:47.190> could<00:00:47.309> mean

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
orientated Skyrim DLC so this could mean

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.850 
orientated Skyrim DLC so this could mean
we<00:00:47.879> could<00:00:48.090> see<00:00:48.329> the<00:00:48.600> draaga<00:00:49.020> coming<00:00:49.559> out<00:00:49.829> of

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
we could see the draaga coming out of

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.889 
we could see the draaga coming out of
their<00:00:50.219> crypts<00:00:50.550> and<00:00:50.730> into<00:00:51.239> the<00:00:51.390> Skyrim

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
their crypts and into the Skyrim

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.470 
their crypts and into the Skyrim
landscape<00:00:52.649> we<00:00:53.489> might<00:00:53.670> see<00:00:53.850> zombies<00:00:54.239> in<00:00:54.390> the

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
landscape we might see zombies in the

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.959 
landscape we might see zombies in the
game<00:00:54.690> something<00:00:55.530> like<00:00:55.680> that<00:00:55.710> but<00:00:56.309> to<00:00:56.579> me<00:00:56.699> would

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
game something like that but to me would

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.760 
game something like that but to me would
seem<00:00:57.000> a<00:00:57.210> little<00:00:57.329> bit<00:00:57.420> samey<00:00:57.750> to<00:00:58.199> have<00:00:58.379> another

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
seem a little bit samey to have another

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.750 
seem a little bit samey to have another
very<00:00:59.280> dark<00:00:59.609> DLC<00:01:00.379> in<00:01:01.379> Skyrim<00:01:02.010> as<00:01:02.219> well<00:01:02.430> as<00:01:02.550> the

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
very dark DLC in Skyrim as well as the

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.070 
very dark DLC in Skyrim as well as the

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
initial dawnguard dlc so thus that

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.020 
initial dawnguard dlc so thus that
