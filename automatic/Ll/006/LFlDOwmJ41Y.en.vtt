00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:11.429
 Personal speech from youtube here is marlon 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.009

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:16.410

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.570

 this is the first video of the new series of the 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.170
 channel and the suggestion of you 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.119
 watching are very important because 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.830
 This leaves the comments so that I 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.849
 can bring better and better videos 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.710
 for you 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.470
 so let's go to the news of this 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.390
 week the movie version of the game of this 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.770
 will have drastic changes in 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.750
 original story 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.160
 who said that was half of the goldman who 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.649
 is producing the film 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.899
 according to him there element of the game need 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.879
 be cut mainly because of the 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.440
 time since the game has 16 hours and the 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.930
 movie will have only two 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.670
 therefore much will be summarized or 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.770
 modified for the cinema 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.870
 a balance made by microsoft shows 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.210
 which the company raised less in sales 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.680
 than spent to produce console the 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.629
 which numerically means that the 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.329
 company lost 400 million dollars 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.610
 in the last eight months of life of xbox 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:08.159
 one in a video posted by warner 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.450
 bros is shown a grand canyon in 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.760
 mortal kombat ex 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.340
 in him the character known to the ancients 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.439
 games appear three edits 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.570

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.970
 different characteristics in each 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.100
 mortal kombat 10 arrives in 2015 to 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.780
 all major platforms and will be the 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.299
 first in the series fully dubbed 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.380
 Brazilian Portuguese during games with 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.180
 2014 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.310
 microsoft announced a new game from 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.320
 tomb raider series as being exclusive 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.600
 from your platform xbox 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.520
 at least in its launch according to the 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.799
 crystal dynamics game developer 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.509
 the choice to be available only in 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:44.579
 microsoft platform was to bring 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:46.710
 a unique experience for players with 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:48.360
 this partnership between the companies for 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.670
 so they could focus on one 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.680
 type of platform only and maximize the 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.420
 quality of production, which is a beautiful 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.340
 Sorry, we all know that in the 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.290
 truth involves a lot of money 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.299
 the other platforms will receive the game 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:03.210
 later but it is not known exactly 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:06.829
 How long would this delay new fight 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:09.330
 for your right to wear a robert cone pm 

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:11.940
 xbox gley 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.730
 amazon from germany released a date 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:17.090
 on your site for pre-sales of g 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:19.489
 just like the playstation 4 xbox wii and pc 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:20.569
 and that day would be November 14 one 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:22.790
 Friday 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:24.409
 in a few hours the page came out of the air 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.360
 amazon is not the first to show a 

00:02:24.409 --> 00:02:28.340
 date for the game attacked the mall 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:30.379
 also released the same date in July 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.269
 as the postings normally occur 

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:33.950
 on Tuesdays and rockstar stays 

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:35.989
 faithful and launch their games on that 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.700
 week may be that the game comes out in 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:40.280
 united states on the 11 th 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.180
 and in Europe on the 14th Friday 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.099
 Following 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:44.959
 rockstar has not released anything official 

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:46.970
 about the date yet and contrary to what 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:48.920
 I expect anything like that's how it was 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:50.720
 shown in games with at least until the 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:53.239
 close this video 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:55.370
 version 2.0 of the new sony console will 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:57.620
 bring the sharpley feature that allows 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:59.060
 share your game with the same friend 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:00.829
 that he does not have the game 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:02.720
 function is the same as passing the 

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:04.519
 control for the friend as you would if 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:06.170
 I was playing together but with 

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:07.910
 difference that your friend might be 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:08.930
 the other side of the world and 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:10.970
 own the game 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:12.500
 just have a playstation 4 and everything will be 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:14.810
 done online 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:17.359
 despite the novelty there will be restriction of 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:19.430
 60 minutes to use the feature 

00:03:17.359 --> 00:03:21.049

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:33.590
 by friends on playstation network 

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:36.169
 can be made by the person's name and 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:38.269
 not just by votes i saying 

00:03:36.169 --> 00:03:40.400
 there would also be new themes to be 

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:42.680
 used to customize the interface of the 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:44.569
 system for more information on this 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:47.359
 function was denied hours later 

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:49.299
 during games with the end of a video 

00:03:47.359 --> 00:03:51.769

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:09.410
 protagonist of the game 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:11.989
 the actor norman reedus famous for the role 

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:13.970
 from there when the walking dead while 

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:15.560

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:17.329
 that touches the bottom 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:19.430
 the game should arrive next year but 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:21.320
 doubts have arisen about whether it will be exclusive 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:23.510
 playstation 4 or not 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:25.789
 after an advertising medium sent 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:27.650
 by sony some news subscribers 

00:04:25.789 --> 00:04:28.880

 Show your pants so afraid 

00:04:31.699 --> 00:04:35.540
 the new name of the game shows that the 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:37.580
 series will finally have a rebound from scratch 

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:39.919
 which we have all expected since 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:42.080
 the last failures of the series with the 

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:44.180
 changing title we can consider 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:46.009
 a new ipÃª goes out of rivers that 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:48.259
 abandon the old series start a new 

00:04:46.009 --> 00:04:51.320
 universe that by the little revealed already 

00:04:48.259 --> 00:04:53.720
 seem to be amazing super rock is a fps 

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:55.190
 which paralyzes the time when you stop and 

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:58.070
 turn around when you move 

00:04:55.190 --> 00:05:00.590
 by the scenario a prototype for browser 

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:02.419
 already exists and the link is in the description I 

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:03.320
 I tested the demo and I guarantee it's worth it 

00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:04.789
 check 

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:07.280

00:05:04.789 --> 00:05:09.280

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:11.960

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:17.570
 entertainment history including 

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:20.419
 games industries music and movies 

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:22.610
 together in this step between planets 

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:25.220
 Earth Venus and Mars 

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:27.139
 beyond the moon and in games with a new one of him 

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:30.410

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:34.880
 with what feet 15 arrives on November 13 

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:35.800
 and big planet book arrives from 18 

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:38.150
 November 

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:40.370
 confirmed that if it has been launched for 

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:43.370

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:44.720
 who can play xbox one also endows 2 

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:47.300

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:52.370
 so with the playstation 4 minecraft goes 

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:53.900

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:55.820
 no date confirmed 

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:57.710
 The novelty is that created worlds can 

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:58.400
 be ported between old and 

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:00.139

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:06.620
 playstation 4 but not the other way around 

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:10.729
 playstation vita for playstation 3 and 

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:12.110
 and xbox 360 for xbox one but not 

00:06:10.729 --> 00:06:14.000
 the inverse 

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:16.370
 mario kart 8 has sold 1 million 

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:19.220
 copies only in the United States consecrating 

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:21.050
 one more success in the mario kart series until 

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:23.060
 the ground floor is almost finished the second 

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:25.220
 season of your main game o 

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:26.720
 walking dead and the other team I already 

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:28.760
 I was planning a new game 

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:30.470
 representative of the famous series 

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:32.120
 for now knows if only that game 

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:34.280
 I would call it listening to the walking files 

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:37.190
 dead and it seems to be a luxury to have 

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:39.590
 telf half rpg the dramatic trailer 

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:41.150
 disclosed is extremely strong and shows 

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:46.670
 a little girl asking for help 

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:48.530
 knocking on someone's door helps 

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:50.300
 ignored by those inside the house and 

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:52.750
 you can hear a buzz attacking the 

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:52.750
 girl 

00:06:56.110 --> 00:07:05.090
 soon after who denied help commits
