 they understand 

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:26.979
 is the decrease in specific

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.220
 consider the basic chemical properties 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:35.930
 semiconductors on the example of the Kremlin 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:37.920

 free electron motion 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:03.680

 electricity does not occur 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:15.050
 where is the preemption of electrons 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:18.400
 in their place, vaccinations are formed

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:59.610
 the fact that the whole electric

 later changes 

00:02:33.119 --> 00:02:34.969
 which are the most painful

 catch up with yourself left blank 

00:02:46.399 --> 00:02:48.189

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:52.189

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:03.749
 this leads to the predominance of the cross
