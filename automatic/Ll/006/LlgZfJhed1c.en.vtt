00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:05.170
 hello how about youtube friends my name 

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:08.340
 it's mister mckinney and they asked me 

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:10.860
 much that which is the highest paying casino 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:14.259
 both in Mexico and in countries 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:16.540
 Latin Americans I think the casino 

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:18.369
 what else pays definitely because of what 

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:20.170
 that I have been playing in many and 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:23.539
 I visited a lot in many states here in 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:25.680
 in Mexico 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:27.599
 definitely the ones who pay the most are the 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.660
 which are the big casinos casinos 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:34.100
 that when you go there are many people and that 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:38.550
 they are obviously raising a lot of money 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:41.640
 because it is very simple and very easy 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:44.220
 it's not the same almost not small with 50 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:48.120
 machines that a monster of 500 machines 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:50.940
 of two floors and with Slavic machines with 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.890
 bingo machines with a sports bed or like 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.710
 bu as it is called as bingo 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:59.640
 traditional with roulette with dice is 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:03.300
 say the money that is going into that 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:05.400
 in this casino is more and therefore it 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.300
 will distribute more but obviously between 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.770
 more people but good after all 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:12.360
 Well, I think we're more excited 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:16.110
 have a big prize than a prize 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:19.410
 small and I do not think definitely not 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:22.229
 I think the two small casinos should 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:24.810
 or accumulated of more than one million 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.909
 pesos or that the casino is very small you 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.060
 pay up to 30 thousand pesos if you are 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:32.369
 Seeing that money is not coming 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:35.250
 then here is the first the first 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:37.649
 Video is because you're in 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.259
 You know you're almost not going to go 

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:42.660
 you really want to win some 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:46.080
 money remember that they are games of chance 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:48.480
 and that are games in quotation marks where 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:51.420
 anyone can win 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:54.360
 but the possibility opens up in the 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.310
 big casinos in the casinos where the 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:59.610
 people are depositing quantities 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:01.350
 strong not the same here but the 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.470
 people are going to deposit 100 pesos even though 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:06.480
 Well not that where 50 customers arrive and 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:08.880
 they all have an average ticket that 

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:10.680
 they are all depositing at 10 thousand pesos and 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.600
 fucking the best the possibility that 

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:15.030
 There is this when with 200 pesos 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:17.190
 good you can within that distribution 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:19.200
 of money you can take a good prize 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.940
 because there really is a lot of money in the 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.470
 air that are terms that are handled 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.840
 much more boxes 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:27.570
 there are many casinos that currently 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:30.210
 They give different types of service to what I 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:33.030
 I mean some will already give you the 

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:34.980
 breakfast some give you cards 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:38.099
 some give you 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:41.340
 Additional points because some will 

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:44.400
 give away souvenirs 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:47.129
 and there are already some casinos that 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:49.170
 true they have been revolutionizing 

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:53.489
 that there are already concerts 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:57.060
 collecting certain level of play I 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:59.760
 they have hired good good stars 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:02.700
 shows and within that almost not 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:04.890
 they are giving good shows not until 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:07.049
 I think it's a plus it's a plus that you 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:09.930
 it's worth going to those casinos there are 

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:11.819
 a casino with an image improved 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:14.489
 I say well as very bad casinos where 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:16.829
 the sandwiches carry everything 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:18.660
 terrible your snacks there are casinos very 

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:21.630
 good where they have put a buffet where 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:23.540
 has gotten real chefs there 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:26.040
 real shows concerts 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:29.940
 imitators where it's really worth 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:32.370
 go to have fun entertain more not you 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:34.420
 exempts the entertainment from winning a 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:36.430
 little money 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:40.090
 which indicated the casino that you 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:43.330
 I recommend that I believe that all 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:45.190
 big and to earn money mentally 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:49.060
