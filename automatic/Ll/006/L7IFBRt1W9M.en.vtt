00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.170
 we totally alamos 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:09.660
 he himself due to thank the 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:11.820
 players or good in the first fifteen minutes 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.710
 play in my 4 and must stand and 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.400
 all how is that possible? 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.400
 you against the dog 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.720
 maybe that's why we are not 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.720
 stable enough 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:23.560
 I 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:26.080
 I think you know I mean long duration 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:27.990
 but good is always when you have to 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:31.329
 basically otherwise you have to walk for one 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:33.910
 2340 is fifteen minutes 20 minutes 

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:35.620
 this not happen but then allowed 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:37.270
 it doesn't happen what happens next 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:41.379
 you know you actually give yourself back in bowl 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:43.000
 away and then you still think about it 

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:43.900
 enough one creates in i think you have the 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.500
 first half not very much 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:50.059
 road has only the second half 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.610
 he said think of play defensive games 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:54.620
 but then we do it ourselves 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:56.539
 bad sound of uncertainty in it 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:58.850
 that it is inexperience uncertainty 

00:00:56.539 --> 00:01:02.019
 pan may be after maybe 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:04.260
 a piece and I also think we are in there 

00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:06.090
 those guys that 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.000
 also need a must support and 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.590
 that is very easy of course 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.110
 very easy to say this is now 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.000
 bad guys or defense this in 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.310
 the boys who are not good enough 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.360
 or everywhere can not lie well though 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.740
 so also a bit of confidence you have to 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.190
 don't forget the games my very young 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.600
 young team also young defense and that 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:27.000
 boys need trust in us 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.740
 and us basically everyone needs the support 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.510
 what can you still mean provider like 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.040
 god are talking about the free man 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:34.740
 they actually don't play 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.360
 well then and yes that is then it is too 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.710
 little more to do I think couple 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.910
 I do not agree we must we must 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.800
 they help and I think they should 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:44.920
 must also have one and not someone with 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:44.920
 someone 

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:49.690
 blame it or he was a doing nothing 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:51.070
 presto I also know we were to have 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:53.770
 still better yes but there are still 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:55.000
 more things that need to be better just 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:57.640
 the whole team it is paul today 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.979
 just collectively and then we have to 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:02.440
 are all so accepted and as we are 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:04.420
 there must also be two three four in me shot 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:07.180
 then you make it easy for it 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:08.890
 and don't transport anyone that happens 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:12.060
 afterwards 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:15.850
 yes that is no longer properly played 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:18.850
 yes you have to be worked on 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:21.390
 I really angry I really angry Oh yes 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:22.739
 you can handle very badly 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.090
 you are very football and love you 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:25.670
 know you know and you are 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.170
 found in his stand obliged to win you 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:30.180
 And then then it's just investing 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.829
 if you experience such an evening altogether 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.689
 which you make yourself so easy to get into 

00:02:31.829 --> 00:02:35.670
 The second minute you come you come one 

00:02:33.689 --> 00:02:36.299
 ahead email so i actually on 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.530
 rose 

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:39.840
 and if you end up being my second 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:41.250
 from fierce step you like him a bit 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.170
 to be angry you have to be angry 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.459
 yes and you count that the outside world 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.200
 small that is quite a loop but that 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:48.150
 has therefore got angry earlier by knife 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.530
 got into criticism now and had there 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.629
 also immediately say if you play like this 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.989
 what should your lungs do wk end up 

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:53.879
 on 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:55.349
 yes but you should n't have any urgent yet 

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:56.579
 very good in the qualifying series 

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:57.510
 race down we say for no one 

00:02:56.579 --> 00:02:59.519
 played a good match 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:02.220
 so that's why i say a but i have 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:04.169
 it already think several boys and also the 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:06.000
 source code we realistically told 

00:03:04.169 --> 00:03:07.530
 is work to be done it is not us 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.060
 do n't go we do n't have to go now 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:10.889
 calling us to go to the World Cup 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.329
 to become a world champion we have to be whole 

00:03:10.889 --> 00:03:14.609
 realistic look at ourselves what must 

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:15.989
 make more steps and I think so 

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:17.549
 we have to get together 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:20.519
 we have to put our heads together 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:22.139
 must be strong together should not be together 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:24.540
 support should discuss this with each other 

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:26.310
 and and all through and that is one 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.989
 huge 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:30.419
 becomes the draw for your penalty 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:30.780
 is so andorra we want to be on now 

00:03:30.419 --> 00:03:32.220
 the wk 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:33.599
 well then you shouldn't forget and then 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:36.150
 you have to take positive but how 

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:37.890
 hard as it is I'm saying I want you 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:40.250
 still happy you must be Apparently 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:40.250
 team gives 

00:03:40.969 --> 00:03:44.900
 well that is then it is now only 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:47.299
 is 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:48.650
 then this house is partying 

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:51.680
 here 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:52.970
 yeah right on i mean its allowed to be happy 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:57.590
 they may be proud of this 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:58.790
 achievement and we don't 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:59.870
 No, we want to say have provided us 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:02.420
 maybe that's a bit too much of it 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:05.930
 the good but the good it's just not 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:08.900
 well so clearly ready 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:11.620
 crossed out and should continue to sum up 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:11.620
 Money is like body
