let me guess all the nitrogen back and

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:06.589 
let me guess all the nitrogen back and
then<00:03:05.099> there's<00:03:05.280> into<00:03:05.639> the<00:03:05.760> ground<00:03:06.000> and<00:03:06.180> then

00:03:06.589 --> 00:03:06.599 
then there's into the ground and then

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:08.479 
then there's into the ground and then
you<00:03:06.810> can<00:03:06.930> grow<00:03:07.109> through<00:03:07.439> then<00:03:08.099> you've<00:03:08.280> got<00:03:08.459> to

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:08.489 
you can grow through then you've got to

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:13.109 
here so this layer was all last year

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:15.319 
here so this layer was all last year
that<00:03:13.379> was<00:03:13.500> potatoes<00:03:14.099> no<00:03:14.760> but<00:03:14.939> they<00:03:15.090> always

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:15.329
