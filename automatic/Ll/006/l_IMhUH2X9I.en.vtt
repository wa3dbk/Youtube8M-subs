these<00:00:10.330> directions<00:00:10.719> for<00:00:11.080> the<00:00:11.139> six-point<00:00:11.650> star

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:11.980 
these directions for the six-point star

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:14.580 
these directions for the six-point star
relief<00:00:12.340> were<00:00:12.879> drawn<00:00:13.120> up<00:00:13.170> for<00:00:14.170> the<00:00:14.260> internet

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:14.590 
relief were drawn up for the internet

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:17.490 
relief were drawn up for the internet
over<00:00:14.740> a<00:00:14.859> decade<00:00:15.219> ago<00:00:16.020> we<00:00:17.020> will<00:00:17.170> show<00:00:17.320> how<00:00:17.470> to

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:17.500 
over a decade ago we will show how to

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:21.210 
over a decade ago we will show how to
make<00:00:17.619> the<00:00:17.980> relief<00:00:19.710> these<00:00:20.710> are<00:00:20.920> the<00:00:20.980> same

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:21.220 
make the relief these are the same

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:24.599 
make the relief these are the same
directions<00:00:21.609> that<00:00:21.939> are<00:00:21.999> used<00:00:22.830> up<00:00:23.830> through<00:00:24.220> step

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:24.609 
directions that are used up through step

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:31.050 
directions that are used up through step
four<00:00:25.589> to<00:00:26.589> make<00:00:27.519> the<00:00:27.820> snowflakes<00:00:30.060> snowflakes

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:31.060 
four to make the snowflakes snowflakes

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:34.020 
four to make the snowflakes snowflakes
will<00:00:31.239> be<00:00:31.269> on<00:00:31.509> the<00:00:31.779> video<00:00:32.290> house<00:00:32.980> number<00:00:33.730> three

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:34.030 
will be on the video house number three

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:35.790 
will be on the video house number three
which<00:00:34.300> would<00:00:34.810> be<00:00:34.870> the<00:00:34.989> next<00:00:35.170> one<00:00:35.320> after<00:00:35.530> this

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:35.800 
which would be the next one after this

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:40.709 
which would be the next one after this
one<00:00:36.989> to<00:00:37.989> make<00:00:38.170> the<00:00:38.410> star<00:00:39.250> relief<00:00:39.640> start<00:00:40.600> off

00:00:40.709 --> 00:00:40.719 
one to make the star relief start off

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:46.220 
one to make the star relief start off
with<00:00:40.870> a<00:00:40.930> square<00:00:41.109> sheet<00:00:41.350> of<00:00:41.469> paper<00:00:41.530> and<00:00:42.989> folding

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:55.080 

triangle<00:00:50.579> folding<00:00:51.579> into<00:00:52.000> a<00:00:52.030> triangle<00:00:54.090> and

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:55.090 
triangle folding into a triangle and

00:00:55.090 --> 00:01:07.050 
triangle folding into a triangle and
then<00:00:55.269> again<00:01:04.410> and<00:01:05.410> now<00:01:05.590> when<00:01:05.830> we<00:01:05.860> fold<00:01:06.850> this

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:07.060 
then again and now when we fold this

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:09.810 
then again and now when we fold this
over<00:01:07.410> we<00:01:08.410> want<00:01:08.620> these<00:01:08.800> angles<00:01:09.250> to<00:01:09.460> be<00:01:09.610> about

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:09.820 
over we want these angles to be about

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:13.260 
over we want these angles to be about
the<00:01:10.030> same<00:01:11.250> this<00:01:12.250> angle<00:01:12.610> in<00:01:12.729> this<00:01:12.820> thing<00:01:13.030> will

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:13.270 
the same this angle in this thing will

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:15.810 
the same this angle in this thing will
be<00:01:13.390> about<00:01:13.570> the<00:01:13.720> same<00:01:13.990> so<00:01:14.409> you<00:01:14.619> can<00:01:14.890> just<00:01:15.100> do<00:01:15.790> it

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:15.820 
be about the same so you can just do it

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:18.749 
be about the same so you can just do it
by<00:01:16.030> high<00:01:16.270> if<00:01:16.329> you<00:01:16.600> like<00:01:16.869> try<00:01:17.860> to<00:01:17.890> even<00:01:18.490> it<00:01:18.610> up

00:01:18.749 --> 00:01:18.759 
by high if you like try to even it up

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:24.870 
by high if you like try to even it up
and<00:01:19.150> then<00:01:19.390> put<00:01:20.250> the<00:01:21.250> creases<00:01:21.670> in<00:01:21.850> there<00:01:23.610> now<00:01:24.610> on

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:24.880 
and then put the creases in there now on

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.740 
and then put the creases in there now on
step<00:01:25.390> 4<00:01:26.549> at<00:01:27.549> this<00:01:27.729> point<00:01:28.030> if<00:01:28.119> we<00:01:28.180> were<00:01:28.360> making<00:01:28.479> a

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:28.750 
step 4 at this point if we were making a

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:30.300 
step 4 at this point if we were making a
snowflake<00:01:29.170> we<00:01:29.439> might<00:01:29.619> cut<00:01:29.829> it<00:01:29.950> differently

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:30.310 
snowflake we might cut it differently

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:35.240 
snowflake we might cut it differently
but<00:01:30.490> it's<00:01:30.640> step<00:01:30.820> 4<00:01:31.149> we<00:01:31.899> cut<00:01:32.399> right<00:01:33.399> across<00:01:33.689> here

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
but it's step 4 we cut right across here

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.350 
but it's step 4 we cut right across here
that's<00:01:36.250> where<00:01:36.520> this<00:01:37.110> part<00:01:38.110> is<00:01:39.119> on<00:01:40.119> the<00:01:40.180> bottom

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:40.360 
that's where this part is on the bottom

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:45.499 
that's where this part is on the bottom
at<00:01:41.259> this<00:01:42.149> point<00:01:43.649> we<00:01:44.649> cut<00:01:44.950> right<00:01:45.100> across

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
at this point we cut right across

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:50.870 
at this point we cut right across
forming<00:01:46.509> in<00:01:46.630> the<00:01:46.719> saucer<00:01:46.990> each<00:01:47.259> triangle

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.800 

though<00:01:51.880> that<00:01:52.119> away<00:01:53.729> and<00:01:54.729> when<00:01:55.119> we<00:01:55.210> unfold<00:01:55.630> it

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:55.810 
though that away and when we unfold it

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:59.210 
though that away and when we unfold it
the<00:01:56.530> phone

00:01:59.210 --> 00:01:59.220 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:03.300 

long<00:02:00.220> points<00:02:00.850> of<00:02:00.970> the<00:02:01.060> star<00:02:01.560> out<00:02:02.560> pull<00:02:02.920> in<00:02:03.130> one

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:03.310 
long points of the star out pull in one

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:05.880 
long points of the star out pull in one
direction<00:02:03.810> this<00:02:04.810> is<00:02:04.960> easier<00:02:05.350> in<00:02:05.500> the<00:02:05.590> six

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:05.890 
direction this is easier in the six

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:08.219 
direction this is easier in the six
point<00:02:06.880> star<00:02:07.210> relief<00:02:07.510> because<00:02:07.720> they<00:02:08.080> go

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229 
point star relief because they go

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:11.040 
point star relief because they go
straight<00:02:08.500> across<00:02:09.420> the<00:02:10.420> shillings<00:02:10.810> are<00:02:10.960> all

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.050 
straight across the shillings are all

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:13.460 
straight across the shillings are all
one<00:02:11.290> in<00:02:11.380> one<00:02:11.530> direction<00:02:11.710> and<00:02:12.190> the<00:02:12.310> sharp<00:02:13.000> foes

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
one in one direction and the sharp foes

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.050 
one in one direction and the sharp foes
well<00:02:14.470> go<00:02:14.770> the<00:02:14.890> opposite<00:02:15.280> direction<00:02:15.340> so<00:02:15.760> if

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
well go the opposite direction so if

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:26.100 
well go the opposite direction so if
they're<00:02:16.240> automated<00:02:23.940> now<00:02:24.940> fold<00:02:25.690> this<00:02:25.840> in

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
they're automated now fold this in

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:33.210 
they're automated now fold this in
ultimate<00:02:26.890> this<00:02:27.900> long-short<00:02:28.900> long-short<00:02:32.220> and

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
ultimate this long-short long-short and

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.490 
ultimate this long-short long-short and
do<00:02:33.400> two<00:02:34.060> or<00:02:34.150> three<00:02:34.209> of<00:02:34.420> them<00:02:34.660> together<00:02:34.840> and

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
do two or three of them together and

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.310 
do two or three of them together and
then<00:02:35.650> bring<00:02:35.950> that<00:02:36.250> one<00:02:36.730> go<00:02:37.000> and<00:02:37.270> bring<00:02:38.140> the

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:38.320 
then bring that one go and bring the

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:47.900 
then bring that one go and bring the
next<00:02:38.530> one<00:02:38.740> up<00:02:43.110> set<00:02:44.110> go<00:02:44.380> and<00:02:44.590> bring<00:02:44.770> the<00:02:44.920> next<00:02:45.130> up

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:51.660 

and<00:02:48.910> continue<00:02:49.750> all<00:02:49.780> the<00:02:49.959> way<00:02:50.080> around<00:02:50.200> and<00:02:50.890> then

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 
and continue all the way around and then

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:53.400 
and continue all the way around and then
around<00:02:52.030> again<00:02:52.390> just<00:02:52.750> to<00:02:52.840> make<00:02:52.870> sure<00:02:53.020> that<00:02:53.290> the

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:53.410 
around again just to make sure that the

00:02:53.410 --> 00:03:00.120 
around again just to make sure that the
creases<00:02:53.680> are<00:02:53.950> nice<00:02:54.160> and<00:02:54.570> flat<00:02:58.770> once<00:02:59.770> you<00:02:59.890> feel

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.130 
creases are nice and flat once you feel

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:02.130 
creases are nice and flat once you feel
like<00:03:00.160> that<00:03:00.520> the<00:03:00.670> creases<00:03:01.060> are<00:03:01.209> nice<00:03:01.450> and<00:03:01.780> flat

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.140 
like that the creases are nice and flat

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:05.670 
like that the creases are nice and flat
and<00:03:02.380> will<00:03:02.470> fold<00:03:03.720> then<00:03:04.720> like<00:03:04.930> the<00:03:05.050> 5-point<00:03:05.560> star

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
and will fold then like the 5-point star

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.650 
and will fold then like the 5-point star
relief<00:03:06.130> you<00:03:06.310> do<00:03:06.489> have<00:03:06.700> a<00:03:06.730> relief<00:03:07.150> you<00:03:07.450> just

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:07.660 
relief you do have a relief you just

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:15.440 
relief you do have a relief you just
push<00:03:07.930> it<00:03:08.110> down<00:03:08.290> and<00:03:08.709> there<00:03:09.640> pops<00:03:10.060> up<00:03:13.320> but<00:03:14.320> this

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
push it down and there pops up but this

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:21.020 
push it down and there pops up but this
will<00:03:16.450> show<00:03:16.630> a<00:03:16.660> little<00:03:16.840> bit<00:03:17.019> more<00:03:17.200> contrast<00:03:19.830> the

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
will show a little bit more contrast the

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.550 
will show a little bit more contrast the
snowflakes<00:03:22.030> which<00:03:22.989> we'll<00:03:23.230> do<00:03:23.320> on<00:03:23.440> the<00:03:23.470> next

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:23.560 
snowflakes which we'll do on the next
