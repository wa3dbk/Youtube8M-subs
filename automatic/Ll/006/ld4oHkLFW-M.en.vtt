00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:38.140 
of the best selfless material that we

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:39.400 
of the best selfless material that we
could<00:04:38.290> possibly

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:39.410 
could possibly

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:42.910

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:42.920 
give to the bleeding world hopefully we

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:45.070 
give to the bleeding world hopefully we
were<00:04:43.370> a<00:04:43.430> big<00:04:43.700> part<00:04:43.940> of<00:04:44.090> pushing<00:04:44.570> that<00:04:44.660> big<00:04:44.870> wall

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:45.080 
were a big part of pushing that big wall

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:47.920 
were a big part of pushing that big wall
over<00:04:45.790> we're<00:04:46.790> calling<00:04:47.120> for<00:04:47.300> revolution

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:47.930 
over we're calling for revolution

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:54.530 
I love the the relaxed approach to

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:56.020 
I love the the relaxed approach to
everyone's<00:04:54.860> recording<00:04:55.310> I<00:04:55.400> was<00:04:55.550> sitting<00:04:55.940> in

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:56.030 
everyone's recording I was sitting in

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:57.460 
everyone's recording I was sitting in
there<00:04:56.120> when<00:04:56.270> Jeff<00:04:56.450> was<00:04:56.570> doing<00:04:56.810> his<00:04:56.930> base<00:04:57.140> and

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:57.470 
there when Jeff was doing his base and

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:01.030 
there when Jeff was doing his base and
it<00:04:57.560> was<00:04:57.650> really<00:04:58.490> like<00:04:59.080> very<00:05:00.080> chilled<00:05:00.560> out<00:05:00.740> it's

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:01.040 
it was really like very chilled out it's

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:03.640 
it was really like very chilled out it's
almost<00:05:01.520> like<00:05:01.730> if<00:05:02.540> we're<00:05:02.810> not<00:05:02.840> having<00:05:03.110> fun<00:05:03.470> we

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:03.650 
almost like if we're not having fun we

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:06.010 
almost like if we're not having fun we
just<00:05:03.830> wait<00:05:04.040> until<00:05:04.280> it<00:05:05.150> feels<00:05:05.360> fun<00:05:05.660> and<00:05:05.930> then

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:06.020 
just wait until it feels fun and then

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:08.800 
just wait until it feels fun and then
get<00:05:06.440> back<00:05:06.530> into<00:05:06.800> it<00:05:06.920> I<00:05:07.670> think<00:05:08.120> that<00:05:08.390> shorter

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:08.810 
get back into it I think that shorter

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:10.810 
get back into it I think that shorter
periods<00:05:09.260> of<00:05:09.380> time<00:05:09.620> in<00:05:09.890> the<00:05:09.920> studio<00:05:10.220> makes<00:05:10.730> a

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:10.820 
periods of time in the studio makes a

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:12.610 
periods of time in the studio makes a
little<00:05:10.910> more<00:05:11.090> productive<00:05:11.570> studio<00:05:11.870> time<00:05:12.170> a<00:05:12.410> lot

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:12.620 
little more productive studio time a lot

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:14.050 
little more productive studio time a lot
of<00:05:12.740> bands<00:05:12.890> get<00:05:13.100> trapped<00:05:13.310> in<00:05:13.490> the<00:05:13.550> studio<00:05:13.880> and

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:14.060 
of bands get trapped in the studio and

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:16.510 
of bands get trapped in the studio and
they<00:05:14.120> get<00:05:14.270> into<00:05:14.390> this<00:05:14.600> like<00:05:14.870> cabin<00:05:15.650> fever<00:05:15.890> funk

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:16.520 
they get into this like cabin fever funk

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:19.630 
they get into this like cabin fever funk
and<00:05:16.820> that's<00:05:17.180> just<00:05:17.330> stifles<00:05:17.900> creativity<00:05:18.110> so<00:05:18.860> we

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:19.640 
and that's just stifles creativity so we

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:24.300 
and that's just stifles creativity so we
try<00:05:19.820> to<00:05:19.880> keep<00:05:20.030> it<00:05:20.150> light<00:05:20.210> but<00:05:20.960> heavy<00:05:21.200> you<00:05:21.530> know

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:24.310 

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:27.220 

what<00:05:25.310> we<00:05:25.430> we<00:05:26.060> had<00:05:26.210> a<00:05:26.240> girl<00:05:26.510> that<00:05:26.630> came<00:05:26.840> back<00:05:27.080> to

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:27.230 
what we we had a girl that came back to

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:30.940 
what we we had a girl that came back to
our<00:05:27.320> bus<00:05:27.530> this<00:05:27.860> was<00:05:28.040> probably<00:05:28.840> 2039<00:05:29.840> and<00:05:30.830> we

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:30.950

took<00:05:31.790> some<00:05:32.060> of<00:05:32.090> her<00:05:32.330> stem<00:05:32.810> cells<00:05:33.140> and<00:05:33.740> we<00:05:33.890> grew

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:34.250 
took some of her stem cells and we grew

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:37.030

a baby on her bus of her and then we

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:39.010 
a baby on her bus of her and then we
recorded<00:05:37.490> the<00:05:37.550> baby<00:05:37.760> singing<00:05:38.240> the<00:05:38.510> lyrics<00:05:38.690> in

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:41.660 
taste of ink perfectly right as the baby

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:44.020 
taste of ink perfectly right as the baby
had<00:05:41.930> been<00:05:42.070> developed<00:05:43.070> inside<00:05:43.340> our<00:05:43.490> artificial

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:44.030 
had been developed inside our artificial

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:46.330 
had been developed inside our artificial
womb<00:05:44.180> door<00:05:44.420> so<00:05:44.570> that<00:05:44.930> our<00:05:45.380> goal<00:05:45.620> that<00:05:46.160> was

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:46.340
