00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:36.890 
cold air out of three of them right in
so<00:02:34.380> you<00:02:34.470> have<00:02:34.590> three<00:02:34.980> blue<00:02:35.520> LEDs<00:02:35.900> they're

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
so you have three blue LEDs they're

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:43.010 
so you have three blue LEDs they're
going<00:02:36.989> to<00:02:38.239> dim<00:02:39.239> it<00:02:39.360> cold<00:02:39.840> there<00:02:41.540> to<00:02:42.540> keep<00:02:42.690> cool

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020 
going to dim it cold there to keep cool

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:45.290 
going to dim it cold there to keep cool
in<00:02:43.080> there<00:02:43.430> I've<00:02:44.430> seen<00:02:44.640> other<00:02:44.790> people<00:02:45.000> do

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 
in there I've seen other people do

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:48.140 
in there I've seen other people do
similar<00:02:45.720> things<00:02:45.980> they've<00:02:46.980> gotten<00:02:47.280> their<00:02:47.459> 360

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
similar things they've gotten their 360

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:52.479 
similar things they've gotten their 360
is<00:02:48.330> 28<00:02:48.780> degrees<00:02:49.320> inside<00:02:50.220> win<00:02:51.180> without<00:02:51.390> them

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:52.489 
is 28 degrees inside win without them

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:56.199 
is 28 degrees inside win without them
they<00:02:53.489> usually<00:02:53.640> about<00:02:53.880> 100<00:02:54.269> and<00:02:54.390> 105<00:02:55.260> 104

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:56.209 
they usually about 100 and 105 104

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:59.479 
they usually about 100 and 105 104
degrees<00:02:57.209> Fahrenheit<00:02:58.019> this<00:02:59.010> little<00:02:59.310> thing

00:02:59.479 --> 00:02:59.489 
degrees Fahrenheit this little thing

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:02.030 
degrees Fahrenheit this little thing
makes<00:02:59.700> it<00:02:59.820> go<00:02:59.910> like<00:03:00.030> 95<00:03:00.600> so<00:03:01.410> you<00:03:01.560> get<00:03:01.650> the<00:03:01.739> three

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
makes it go like 95 so you get the three

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.960 
makes it go like 95 so you get the three
bloody<00:03:02.640> family<00:03:03.209> fans<00:03:03.690> and<00:03:04.640> you<00:03:05.640> probably<00:03:05.820> a

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
cool about 80 something degrees huh you

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.020 
cool about 80 something degrees huh you
want<00:03:10.080> to<00:03:10.140> test<00:03:10.380> it<00:03:10.620> out<00:03:10.739> well<00:03:11.250> i<00:03:11.280> would<00:03:11.549> say<00:03:11.790> i
