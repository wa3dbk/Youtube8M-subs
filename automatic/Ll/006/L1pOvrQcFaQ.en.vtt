00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:06.140
 good head because he was asked Mrs. 

00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:09.360
 we cast a head 

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:10.770
 and I could not throw much I was 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.290
 working a little more with my hook 

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:15.059
 left up and down 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.860
 but I hope everything is fine 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:20.430
 to fight or talk about fighting in 

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:23.250
 December is very premature because it does not 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:26.040
 we can be running to keep 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:30.020
 I'm exercising not to stick in the 

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:30.020
 appliances for a month let's see 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:38.489
 what always tell me activity with 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:40.470
 little level but I think I missed more 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.540
 my right hand my right hand Thursday 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:48.550
 was the key they proposed what it will do 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:54.120
 because it quite next for you 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:54.120
 I think that of the 160 we are going to see 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:10.750
 we're in the middle of the fight never 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:13.540
 I felt that the closed always felt that 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:15.590
 in control of the fight if there were rounds 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:18.079
 I feel that as 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:20.420
 when the first hand was the little 

00:01:18.079 --> 00:01:31.490
 oldest not run but all the 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:33.840
 organs because of the three judges 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:36.810
 they did not have the fight in my favor 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:40.859
 as I believe that people expected not 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:42.479
 cause but if I had an upside down fight 

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:43.710
 as I tell you that I was going to see there that 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.869
 those conditions come to me 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.759
 Where because of Cuba's fight 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:52.469
 grace but hit me a lot with the head 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:54.539
 and he asks me do they ask the judges in 

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:58.469
 the last two three functions have 

00:01:54.539 --> 00:02:00.929
 been a bit this loaded here this 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:03.509
 you feel that there was no support for you 

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:05.700
 for nothing I feel that the judges 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:08.519
 they were on the side of the rhythm and they 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:11.039
 account of clean and clear punches 

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:14.519
 that I connected the fight I had it like that 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:17.280
 7 we go to 3 and I expected the fight 

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:19.829
 that form was never ever scared 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:22.700
 because those who fraser from the square 

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:22.700
 where july 

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:30.530
 but no 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:46.950
 one 

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:46.950
 if not 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:54.660
 [Laughs] 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:03:00.180
 it was not the best 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:03:00.180
 urbina with respect to childbirth 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:19.080
 for me 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:40.590
 It is much more 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:46.030
 i
