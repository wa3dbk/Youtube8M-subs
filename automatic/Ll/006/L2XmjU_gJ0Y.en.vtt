obviously<00:02:19.430> what<00:02:19.760> I'm<00:02:19.880> looking<00:02:20.180> for<00:02:20.420> is<00:02:22.180> when

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
obviously what I'm looking for is when

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.300 
obviously what I'm looking for is when
they<00:02:23.360> finish<00:02:23.990> all<00:02:24.170> the<00:02:24.260> rivets<00:02:24.440> over<00:02:24.890> they

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
looked very consistent and I have

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.590 
looked very consistent and I have
somebody<00:02:30.800> very<00:02:31.190> similar<00:02:31.640> to<00:02:31.760> that<00:02:31.910> yeah

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:32.600 
somebody very similar to that yeah

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:35.860 
somebody very similar to that yeah
from<00:02:34.120> fish<00:02:35.120> wolf<00:02:35.390> noise

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
from fish wolf noise

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:39.070 
from fish wolf noise
sort<00:02:36.530> of<00:02:36.590> I<00:02:36.860> remember<00:02:36.920> seeing<00:02:37.400> that<00:02:37.850> from<00:02:38.840> what

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:39.080 
sort of I remember seeing that from what

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:41.790 
sort of I remember seeing that from what
I've<00:02:39.200> used<00:02:39.230> off<00:02:39.680> was<00:02:40.250> the<00:02:40.489> saw<00:02:40.790> blade<00:02:41.030> Knight

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:41.800 
I've used off was the saw blade Knight

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:44.710 
I've used off was the saw blade Knight
goes<00:02:42.800> through<00:02:43.040> God<00:02:43.640> knows<00:02:43.820> every<00:02:44.060> year<00:02:44.300> yeah

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.720 
goes through God knows every year yeah

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:47.440 
goes through God knows every year yeah
but<00:02:45.620> the<00:02:45.709> edge<00:02:46.489> on<00:02:46.700> that<00:02:46.730> is<00:02:47.090> far<00:02:47.300> better

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
but the edge on that is far better

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:48.970 
but the edge on that is far better
because<00:02:47.750> you<00:02:47.870> could<00:02:48.110> say<00:02:48.290> his<00:02:48.470> treats<00:02:48.709> treats

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
because you could say his treats treats

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.990 
because you could say his treats treats
at<00:02:49.220> that<00:02:49.340> sambar<00:02:49.840> quite<00:02:50.840> primitive<00:02:51.110> yeah<00:02:51.680> that

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
at that sambar quite primitive yeah that

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.250 
at that sambar quite primitive yeah that
it's<00:02:53.000> not<00:02:53.180> bad<00:02:53.390> is<00:02:53.630> it<00:02:53.780> a<00:02:53.810> lot<00:02:54.019> of<00:02:54.050> the<00:02:54.140> old

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
it's not bad is it a lot of the old

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.430 
it's not bad is it a lot of the old
condors<00:02:54.739> used<00:02:54.980> to<00:02:55.100> be<00:02:55.690> the<00:02:56.690> three<00:02:56.989> fours<00:02:57.260> and

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.440 
condors used to be the three fours and

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.740 
condors used to be the three fours and
five<00:02:57.590> inches<00:02:57.980> yeah<00:02:58.370> a<00:02:58.700> bit<00:02:59.150> bit<00:02:59.390> hit<00:02:59.540> and<00:02:59.570> miss

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750 
five inches yeah a bit bit hit and miss

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:02.650 
five inches yeah a bit bit hit and miss
but<00:03:00.200> that<00:03:00.530> one<00:03:00.680> feels<00:03:00.950> pretty<00:03:01.220> good<00:03:01.660> two
