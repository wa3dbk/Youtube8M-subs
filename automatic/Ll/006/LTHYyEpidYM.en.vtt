00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:03.750 
the inspiration of the design of a RC

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:06.829 
the inspiration of the design of a RC
started<00:00:04.440> from<00:00:04.650> our<00:00:04.859> package<00:00:05.400> concept<00:00:06.180> that<00:00:06.779> is

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
started from our package concept that is

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:10.780 
started from our package concept that is
was<00:00:07.140> a<00:00:07.170> basement<00:00:08.130> platform<00:00:09.139> very<00:00:10.139> safety<00:00:10.590> and

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:10.790 
was a basement platform very safety and

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:14.120 
was a basement platform very safety and

city as mallanna is now in this monitor

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.759 
city as mallanna is now in this monitor
too<00:00:29.910> many<00:00:30.119> cars<00:00:30.390> in<00:00:30.630> this<00:00:30.990> in<00:00:31.320> this<00:00:31.470> in<00:00:31.679> the

too many cars in this in this in the

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.240 
too many cars in this in this in the
cities<00:00:32.130> and<00:00:32.480> it's<00:00:33.480> so<00:00:33.690> difficult<00:00:33.930> to<00:00:34.320> find

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
cities and it's so difficult to find

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.830 
cities and it's so difficult to find
parking<00:00:35.790> places<00:00:36.059> to<00:00:36.870> find<00:00:37.140> a<00:00:37.410> to<00:00:38.219> go<00:00:38.910> to<00:00:39.270> to<00:00:39.629> to

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
parking places to find a to go to to to

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.130 
parking places to find a to go to to to
to<00:00:39.870> drive<00:00:40.770> in<00:00:40.950> the<00:00:41.070> city<00:00:41.360> industry<00:00:42.360> that's<00:00:42.960> why

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
to drive in the city industry that's why

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.279 
to drive in the city industry that's why
I<00:00:43.350> think<00:00:43.530> this<00:00:43.800> could<00:00:44.340> be<00:00:44.370> considered<00:00:44.850> as<00:00:45.090> a

00:00:45.279 --> 00:00:45.289 
I think this could be considered as a

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:48.590 
I think this could be considered as a
substitution<00:00:46.289> of<00:00:46.379> a<00:00:46.530> car<00:00:46.739> or<00:00:46.980> some<00:00:47.760> kind<00:00:48.510> of

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
substitution of a car or some kind of

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.619 
substitution of a car or some kind of
mix<00:00:48.870> between<00:00:49.500> a<00:00:49.649> car<00:00:49.920> and<00:00:49.950> a<00:00:50.449> scooter<00:00:51.449> or<00:00:51.600> a

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
mix between a car and a scooter or a

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.990 
mix between a car and a scooter or a
bike<00:00:51.899> as<00:00:52.530> you<00:00:52.739> want<00:00:52.920> because<00:00:53.250> there's<00:00:53.670> every

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
bike as you want because there's every

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.600 
bike as you want because there's every
good<00:00:54.539> point<00:00:54.840> of<00:00:55.020> a<00:00:55.110> car<00:00:55.379> there's<00:00:55.980> as<00:00:56.250> a<00:00:56.280> safety

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
good point of a car there's as a safety

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:02.209 
good point of a car there's as a safety
as<00:00:56.940> a<00:00:58.430> stability<00:00:59.960> and<00:01:00.960> there's<00:01:01.440> all<00:01:01.710> the<00:01:01.980> good

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
as a stability and there's all the good

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.329 
as a stability and there's all the good
points<00:01:02.579> that<00:01:02.760> the<00:01:02.910> bike<00:01:03.870> or<00:01:04.170> scooter<00:01:04.409> has<00:01:04.799> so

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
points that the bike or scooter has so

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.679 
points that the bike or scooter has so
that<00:01:05.489> means<00:01:05.760> is<00:01:06.299> not<00:01:06.600> so<00:01:06.840> so<00:01:07.170> big<00:01:07.409> so<00:01:07.740> small<00:01:08.400> and

00:01:08.679 --> 00:01:08.689 
that means is not so so big so small and

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:11.390 
that means is not so so big so small and
protective<00:01:09.689> and<00:01:09.869> it's<00:01:10.530> fun<00:01:10.799> to<00:01:10.830> drive<00:01:11.159> as<00:01:11.369> a

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
protective and it's fun to drive as a

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.450 
protective and it's fun to drive as a
bike

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.820

inside<00:01:58.009> unique<00:01:59.009> part<00:01:59.340> of<00:01:59.490> these<00:01:59.700> concept<00:02:00.240> is

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
inside unique part of these concept is

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.370 
inside unique part of these concept is
the<00:02:01.140> assistant<00:02:01.440> opening<00:02:02.220> I<00:02:02.429> mean<00:02:03.259> when<00:02:04.259> is

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
the assistant opening I mean when is

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.310 
the assistant opening I mean when is
park<00:02:04.649> it<00:02:04.830> it's<00:02:05.369> closed<00:02:05.759> as<00:02:06.509> a<00:02:06.570> shelf<00:02:06.899> but<00:02:07.259> I

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
park it it's closed as a shelf but I

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.859 
park it it's closed as a shelf but I
really<00:02:07.679> like<00:02:07.890> the<00:02:08.130> system<00:02:08.640> when<00:02:08.850> out<00:02:09.149> open<00:02:09.660> and

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
really like the system when out open and

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.830 
really like the system when out open and
how<00:02:10.050> to<00:02:10.110> close<00:02:10.440> it<00:02:10.700> because<00:02:11.700> is<00:02:11.880> a<00:02:12.090> I<00:02:12.420> think

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
how to close it because is a I think

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.330 
how to close it because is a I think
it's<00:02:12.959> really<00:02:13.200> informative<00:02:13.290> idea<00:02:13.920> it's<00:02:14.220> a

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
it's really informative idea it's a

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.430 
it's really informative idea it's a
really<00:02:14.519> new<00:02:14.730> idea<00:02:15.030> of<00:02:15.120> it<00:02:15.420> so<00:02:15.930> it's<00:02:16.110> a<00:02:16.140> kind<00:02:16.290> of

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
really new idea of it so it's a kind of

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:21.000 
really new idea of it so it's a kind of
new<00:02:17.160> system<00:02:17.730> for<00:02:17.760> for<00:02:18.540> caprica

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
new system for for caprica
