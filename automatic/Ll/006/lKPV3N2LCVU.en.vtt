00:00:23.955 --> 00:00:28.737
Your words 'I love you'
Your words 'I take care of you'

00:00:28.737 --> 00:00:32.423
Those words really
encourage me 

00:00:32.423 --> 00:00:33.773
My lover lover 

00:00:33.773 --> 00:00:38.421
A pleasant time
I feel happy when I see you

00:00:38.421 --> 00:00:43.769
(Dreaming my Dreams)
When can I be as happy as I'm now?

00:00:43.769 --> 00:00:45.986
While we're together 

00:00:45.986 --> 00:00:48.411
While we're far away 

00:00:48.411 --> 00:00:52.049
Taking care of each other
My love 

00:00:52.049 --> 00:00:53.496
So warmhearted

00:00:53.496 --> 00:00:56.084
Like a brother sometimes
(like a friend) 

00:00:56.084 --> 00:00:58.462
Like a real man sometimes
(like a little brother)

00:00:58.462 --> 00:01:03.517
I understand you
and I love you 

00:01:03.517 --> 00:01:05.853
I will always love you 

00:01:05.853 --> 00:01:08.200
I won't change my heart 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.783
Our precious time 

00:01:10.783 --> 00:01:13.054
From this moment forever

00:01:13.054 --> 00:01:14.976
You look at me only 

00:01:14.976 --> 00:01:17.814
Then I look at you 

00:01:17.814 --> 00:01:25.220
Just like now,
we'll always be together 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:33.018
I need you
oh no oh

00:01:33.018 --> 00:01:37.678
If I just watch you,
I could fall in your smile

00:01:37.678 --> 00:01:41.413
You're the most
special one in the world 

00:01:41.413 --> 00:01:42.886
My lover lover

00:01:42.886 --> 00:01:45.104
My heart's getting bigger

00:01:45.104 --> 00:01:47.862
I wanna give everything
(Dreaming my Dreams)

00:01:47.862 --> 00:01:52.915
How can I say more

00:01:52.915 --> 00:01:55.261
Even we're together

00:01:55.261 --> 00:01:57.715
I wanna see you more

00:01:57.715 --> 00:02:01.348
Nothing can comepare with
(My Love) 

00:02:01.348 --> 00:02:02.754
My cute love

00:02:02.754 --> 00:02:05.489
Sometimes it's hard
(when you're hurt) 

00:02:05.489 --> 00:02:08.220
Don't let go of my hand
(hold you tight) 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.556
I want you to be
happy just like now

00:02:12.556 --> 00:02:15.002
I will always love you

00:02:15.002 --> 00:02:17.408
I won't change my heart

00:02:17.408 --> 00:02:20.054
Our precious time

00:02:20.054 --> 00:02:22.323
From this moment forever

00:02:22.323 --> 00:02:24.250
You look at me only

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:27.084
Then I look at you

00:02:27.084 --> 00:02:33.733
Just like now,
we'll always be together

00:02:33.733 --> 00:02:36.989
Our life had been so different
but we've met

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:39.659
And we take care of each other

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:42.804
It could be challenging

00:02:42.804 --> 00:02:46.956
But let's think together

00:02:46.956 --> 00:02:55.662
Let's try together 

00:02:57.339 --> 00:02:59.551
My love only for you

00:02:59.551 --> 00:03:02.009
My heart wants to
give you everything

00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:04.244
It won't change forever

00:03:04.244 --> 00:03:06.879
I promise
Forever..

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:08.823
I'll always be..

00:03:08.823 --> 00:03:11.610
Just like this,
I'll always be..

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:18.802
Just like now
we'll always be together

00:03:18.802 --> 00:03:27.369
I need you
oh no oh
