just like so now I've got two different
valve<00:03:58.840> grinding<00:03:59.440> tools<00:04:00.060> I'm<00:04:01.060> going<00:04:01.209> to<00:04:01.300> show

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:01.450 
valve grinding tools I'm going to show

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:03.059 
valve grinding tools I'm going to show
you<00:04:01.480> one<00:04:01.780> of<00:04:01.810> them<00:04:02.020> and<00:04:02.170> it's<00:04:02.260> not<00:04:02.319> my<00:04:02.590> favorite

for<00:04:05.170> this<00:04:06.150> for<00:04:07.150> these<00:04:07.330> valves<00:04:08.319> so<00:04:09.100> it<00:04:09.280> might

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:09.640 
for this for these valves so it might

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:13.140 
for this for these valves so it might
just<00:04:09.700> be<00:04:10.300> what<00:04:10.510> I<00:04:10.540> got<00:04:10.810> to<00:04:11.020> do<00:04:11.850> what<00:04:12.850> I<00:04:12.880> got<00:04:13.000> to

down to the valve and see I'll show you

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:51.000 
down to the valve and see I'll show you
why<00:04:48.669> I<00:04:48.700> don't<00:04:48.820> like<00:04:49.150> this<00:04:49.330> one<00:04:49.600> it<00:04:49.750> it<00:04:50.740> moves

00:04:53.969 --> 00:04:53.979 
around the way too much the suction cup

00:04:53.979 --> 00:04:55.620 
around the way too much the suction cup
never<00:04:54.220> wants<00:04:54.490> to<00:04:54.550> stick<00:04:54.880> cause<00:04:55.150> it's<00:04:55.300> hard<00:04:55.510> to

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:55.630 
never wants to stick cause it's hard to

00:04:55.630 --> 00:05:02.550 
never wants to stick cause it's hard to
put<00:04:55.919> proper<00:04:56.919> pressure<00:04:57.340> on<00:04:57.669> it<00:05:01.110> yeah<00:05:02.110> and<00:05:02.380> as

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:02.560 
put proper pressure on it yeah and as

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:04.219 
put proper pressure on it yeah and as
you<00:05:02.710> can<00:05:02.860> see<00:05:02.919> I<00:05:03.130> can't<00:05:03.460> get<00:05:03.550> the<00:05:03.700> valve<00:05:03.880> turn

00:05:04.219 --> 00:05:04.229 
you can see I can't get the valve turn

00:05:04.229 --> 00:05:07.350 
you can see I can't get the valve turn
so<00:05:05.640> what<00:05:06.640> we're<00:05:06.760> going<00:05:06.850> to<00:05:06.910> do<00:05:07.060> at<00:05:07.150> that<00:05:07.180> point

just<00:05:47.620> rub<00:05:47.919> that<00:05:47.949> valve<00:05:48.370> back<00:05:48.669> and<00:05:48.910> forth<00:05:49.120> you

00:05:49.379 --> 00:05:49.389 
just rub that valve back and forth you

00:05:49.389 --> 00:05:51.089 
just rub that valve back and forth you
if<00:05:49.539> you<00:05:49.630> can<00:05:49.810> picture<00:05:49.990> that<00:05:50.139> sandpaper<00:05:50.889> in

00:05:51.089 --> 00:05:51.099 
if you can picture that sandpaper in

00:05:51.099 --> 00:05:52.920 
if you can picture that sandpaper in
there<00:05:51.280> okay<00:05:51.669> don't<00:05:51.940> put<00:05:52.120> hardly<00:05:52.449> any<00:05:52.599> pressure

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:52.930 
there okay don't put hardly any pressure

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:57.839 
there okay don't put hardly any pressure
on<00:05:53.080> it<00:05:53.229> just<00:05:53.560> very<00:05:53.889> very<00:05:54.039> light<00:05:54.520> pressure<00:05:56.849> you

00:05:57.839 --> 00:05:57.849 
on it just very very light pressure you

00:05:57.849 --> 00:06:00.240 
on it just very very light pressure you
can<00:05:58.000> picture<00:05:58.210> that<00:05:58.360> sandpapery<00:05:59.380> water-based

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:00.250 
can picture that sandpapery water-based

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:02.460 
can picture that sandpapery water-based
stuff<00:06:00.580> that<00:06:00.759> I<00:06:00.849> showed<00:06:01.060> you<00:06:01.120> in<00:06:01.360> there<00:06:01.539> what

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:02.470 
stuff that I showed you in there what

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:05.129 
stuff that I showed you in there what
it's<00:06:02.620> doing<00:06:03.009> is<00:06:03.220> it's<00:06:04.150> sanding<00:06:04.690> down<00:06:04.840> that

00:06:05.129 --> 00:06:05.139 
it's doing is it's sanding down that

00:06:05.139 --> 00:06:08.010 
it's doing is it's sanding down that
seat<00:06:05.470> so<00:06:06.400> that<00:06:06.430> that<00:06:06.789> brand-new<00:06:07.270> valve<00:06:07.630> and

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:08.020 
seat so that that brand-new valve and

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:12.120 
seat so that that brand-new valve and
the<00:06:08.199> old<00:06:08.380> seat<00:06:09.270> will<00:06:10.270> actually<00:06:10.840> match<00:06:11.199> the<00:06:11.770> way

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:12.130 
the old seat will actually match the way

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:15.659 
the old seat will actually match the way
they're<00:06:12.340> supposed<00:06:12.460> to<00:06:13.080> and<00:06:14.340> you'll<00:06:15.340> hear<00:06:15.639> it

00:06:15.659 --> 00:06:15.669 
they're supposed to and you'll hear it

00:06:15.669 --> 00:06:17.580 
they're supposed to and you'll hear it
after<00:06:16.120> a<00:06:16.150> while<00:06:16.360> it'll<00:06:16.690> sound<00:06:16.930> like<00:06:17.110> the<00:06:17.320> sand

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:17.590 
after a while it'll sound like the sand

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:22.610 
after a while it'll sound like the sand
starting<00:06:18.039> to<00:06:18.099> go<00:06:18.280> away<00:06:19.229> and<00:06:20.229> at<00:06:20.349> that<00:06:20.560> point

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:22.620 
starting to go away and at that point

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:25.320 
starting to go away and at that point
you<00:06:23.620> either<00:06:23.740> add<00:06:23.979> some<00:06:24.250> new<00:06:24.400> sand<00:06:24.729> or<00:06:25.030> you<00:06:25.120> take

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:25.330 
you either add some new sand or you take

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:27.930 
you either add some new sand or you take
a<00:06:25.389> look<00:06:25.570> at<00:06:25.720> your<00:06:25.900> seat<00:06:26.169> and<00:06:26.470> you<00:06:27.400> just<00:06:27.610> want<00:06:27.880> to

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:27.940 
a look at your seat and you just want to

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:30.140 
a look at your seat and you just want to
see<00:06:28.180> that<00:06:28.419> there's<00:06:28.630> a<00:06:28.750> distinct<00:06:29.560> marking

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:30.150 
see that there's a distinct marking

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:34.110 
see that there's a distinct marking
where<00:06:31.150> the<00:06:31.180> valve<00:06:31.599> has<00:06:31.810> been<00:06:31.840> meeting<00:06:32.380> and<00:06:33.120> you

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:34.120 
where the valve has been meeting and you

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:36.830 
where the valve has been meeting and you
want<00:06:34.300> to<00:06:34.389> see<00:06:34.539> a<00:06:34.570> distinct<00:06:35.169> line<00:06:35.380> on<00:06:35.620> that<00:06:35.800> seat

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:36.840 
want to see a distinct line on that seat

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:39.570 
want to see a distinct line on that seat
and<00:06:37.840> you're<00:06:38.349> just<00:06:38.560> like<00:06:39.130> so<00:06:39.340> you're<00:06:39.520> just

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:39.580 
and you're just like so you're just

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:41.700 
and you're just like so you're just
looking<00:06:39.789> for<00:06:40.120> a<00:06:40.150> good<00:06:40.330> a<00:06:40.630> good<00:06:41.139> contact

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:41.710 
looking for a good a good contact

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:43.980 
looking for a good a good contact
pattern<00:06:42.280> so<00:06:43.060> that<00:06:43.180> you<00:06:43.300> make<00:06:43.479> sure<00:06:43.509> that<00:06:43.840> your

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:43.990 
pattern so that you make sure that your

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:47.520 
pattern so that you make sure that your
seats<00:06:44.349> and<00:06:45.219> your<00:06:45.400> valves<00:06:45.880> are<00:06:46.539> meeting<00:06:47.050> just

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:47.530 
seats and your valves are meeting just

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:49.649 
seats and your valves are meeting just
the<00:06:47.650> way<00:06:47.740> they're<00:06:47.889> supposed<00:06:48.039> to<00:06:48.539> the<00:06:49.539> other

00:06:49.649 --> 00:06:49.659 
the way they're supposed to the other

00:06:49.659 --> 00:06:51.480 
the way they're supposed to the other
thing<00:06:49.930> this<00:06:50.050> is<00:06:50.229> useful<00:06:50.590> on<00:06:50.680> is<00:06:50.919> on<00:06:51.130> heads

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:51.490 
thing this is useful on is on heads

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:53.909 
thing this is useful on is on heads
where<00:06:51.880> say<00:06:52.479> you<00:06:52.509> got<00:06:52.840> a<00:06:52.870> set<00:06:53.110> of<00:06:53.229> valves<00:06:53.650> that

00:06:53.909 --> 00:06:53.919 
where say you got a set of valves that

00:06:53.919 --> 00:06:56.939 
where say you got a set of valves that
are<00:06:54.070> burnt<00:06:54.360> you<00:06:55.360> can<00:06:55.539> actually<00:06:55.719> lap<00:06:56.349> in<00:06:56.620> a<00:06:56.710> set

00:06:56.939 --> 00:06:56.949 
are burnt you can actually lap in a set

00:06:56.949 --> 00:06:58.920 
are burnt you can actually lap in a set
of<00:06:57.070> burnt<00:06:57.280> valves<00:06:57.729> and<00:06:57.880> sometimes<00:06:58.630> if<00:06:58.810> the

00:06:58.920 --> 00:06:58.930 
of burnt valves and sometimes if the

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:01.230 
of burnt valves and sometimes if the
valves<00:06:59.199> aren't<00:06:59.320> burnt<00:06:59.560> too<00:06:59.830> bad<00:07:00.070> you<00:07:01.000> can

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:01.240 
valves aren't burnt too bad you can

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:04.080 
valves aren't burnt too bad you can
actually<00:07:01.659> repair<00:07:02.159> Burke<00:07:03.159> valve<00:07:03.460> if<00:07:03.820> they're

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:04.090 
actually repair Burke valve if they're

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:06.089 
actually repair Burke valve if they're
not<00:07:04.180> burnt<00:07:04.449> too<00:07:04.659> bad<00:07:04.840> the<00:07:05.680> other<00:07:05.830> thing<00:07:06.070> that

00:07:06.089 --> 00:07:06.099 
not burnt too bad the other thing that

00:07:06.099 --> 00:07:09.600 
not burnt too bad the other thing that
is<00:07:06.490> useful<00:07:06.849> for<00:07:07.360> is<00:07:07.659> on<00:07:08.229> of<00:07:08.440> an<00:07:09.159> engine<00:07:09.490> that's

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:09.610 
is useful for is on of an engine that's

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:12.270 
is useful for is on of an engine that's
been<00:07:09.820> out<00:07:10.000> in<00:07:10.180> the<00:07:11.020> rain<00:07:11.229> and<00:07:11.259> getting<00:07:11.770> wet<00:07:12.009> and

00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:12.280 
been out in the rain and getting wet and

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:14.730 
been out in the rain and getting wet and
you'll<00:07:12.909> start<00:07:13.240> to<00:07:13.360> see<00:07:13.389> some<00:07:13.599> pitting<00:07:14.199> down

00:07:14.730 --> 00:07:14.740 
you'll start to see some pitting down

00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:18.659 
you'll start to see some pitting down
along<00:07:15.099> the<00:07:15.280> seat<00:07:15.520> and<00:07:16.289> in<00:07:17.289> the<00:07:17.409> valve<00:07:17.620> and<00:07:17.979> you

00:07:18.659 --> 00:07:18.669 
along the seat and in the valve and you

00:07:18.669 --> 00:07:19.890 
along the seat and in the valve and you
can<00:07:18.820> use<00:07:19.000> a<00:07:19.030> little<00:07:19.240> bit<00:07:19.360> of<00:07:19.449> lapping<00:07:19.870> compound

00:07:19.890 --> 00:07:19.900 
can use a little bit of lapping compound

00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:22.079 
can use a little bit of lapping compound
or<00:07:20.620> valve<00:07:20.830> grading<00:07:21.219> compound<00:07:21.729> whatever<00:07:22.000> you

00:07:22.079 --> 00:07:22.089 
or valve grading compound whatever you

00:07:22.089 --> 00:07:23.909 
or valve grading compound whatever you
want<00:07:22.240> to<00:07:22.300> call<00:07:22.449> it<00:07:22.630> and<00:07:22.779> you<00:07:23.620> can<00:07:23.740> actually

00:07:23.909 --> 00:07:23.919 
want to call it and you can actually

00:07:23.919 --> 00:07:26.330 
want to call it and you can actually
work<00:07:24.219> that<00:07:24.490> valve<00:07:24.760> in<00:07:24.969> so

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:26.340 
work that valve in so

00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:29.930 
work that valve in so
that's<00:07:27.300> basically<00:07:28.020> all<00:07:28.170> there<00:07:28.290> is<00:07:28.650> to<00:07:28.860> it<00:07:29.010> now

00:07:29.930 --> 00:07:29.940 
that's basically all there is to it now

00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:32.260 
that's basically all there is to it now
you<00:07:30.330> got<00:07:30.600> to<00:07:30.720> do<00:07:30.810> each<00:07:31.050> one<00:07:31.290> of<00:07:31.410> these<00:07:31.500> valves

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:32.270 
you got to do each one of these valves

00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:37.300 
you got to do each one of these valves
and<00:07:33.270> and<00:07:33.780> so<00:07:34.020> on<00:07:34.230> like<00:07:34.530> you<00:07:34.710> would<00:07:34.860> imagine<00:07:35.370> but

00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:37.310 
and and so on like you would imagine but

00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:40.510 
and and so on like you would imagine but
string<00:07:38.310> down<00:07:38.460> there<00:07:38.850> for<00:07:39.090> whatever<00:07:39.570> reason

00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:40.520 
string down there for whatever reason

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:42.590 
string down there for whatever reason
anyway<00:07:41.520> so<00:07:41.580> you<00:07:41.790> want<00:07:41.940> to<00:07:42.000> do<00:07:42.090> each<00:07:42.240> one<00:07:42.480> of

00:07:42.590 --> 00:07:42.600 
anyway so you want to do each one of

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:44.060 
anyway so you want to do each one of
these<00:07:42.690> and<00:07:42.900> then<00:07:43.020> after<00:07:43.440> you<00:07:43.530> get<00:07:43.680> done<00:07:43.860> with

00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:44.070 
these and then after you get done with

00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:46.040 
these and then after you get done with
each<00:07:44.220> one<00:07:44.460> of<00:07:44.520> these<00:07:44.730> you<00:07:45.540> want<00:07:45.750> to<00:07:45.870> make<00:07:46.020> sure

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:46.050
