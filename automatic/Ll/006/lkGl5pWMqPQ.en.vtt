00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.790
 good morning to all and thank you for being 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:08.069
 always so numerous and to follow i 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.950
 our canals on dental pathologies e 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.990
 of cannizzo studies as you know in the meantime 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.509
 modern direction is called upon 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:18.060
 in fact, we cannot succeed in the 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:20.850
 most cases to give back all 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:24.060
 fixed teeth in one hour session 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:26.279
 if you have the last teeth you dance known 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.070
 you are already toothless or even in the case 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:31.769
 in which you are interested in putting 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:34.530
 single missing teeth with our in 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:37.940
 pathology will be performed in one 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:40.230
 one hour session the stations are never 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:43.559
 the insertion of the plants that is of the 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.809
 inviting big screws and immediately into the 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.910
 same session then they all connect 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.039
 fixed teeth 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:52.680
 then the patient returns home with 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:55.170
 all temporary fixed teeth already 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.750
 absolutely fixed inhabitants ai 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.510
 plants will then return to 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:03.719
 smile and chew already from the same 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:06.060
 day this is our daily life and 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:08.610
 our daily botin and we succeed in 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:12.260
 solve at least four cases each 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:15.090
 day examples of this innovative 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.930
 technology of this innovative in 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.720
 pathology 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:21.920
 you can see them on our website 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:24.360
 internet smiles perfect point in 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:27.119
 the topic of today and you will see a lot 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:30.509
 interesting is focused on the type of 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:34.220
 material we use to make 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:36.409
 the definitive bridge in fact as you know 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.270
 the day 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:40.039
 technologies are put on regrets e 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:43.100
 all fixed teeth are connected 

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:46.340
 which are provisional and after a few months 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:48.770
 we move on to the definitive bridge phase 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:52.390
 this applies both to an arch and 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:55.490
 losers symbols here is very important 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:57.969
 understand that there are various on the market 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:01.549
 types of material ie definitive bridge 

00:01:57.969 --> 00:02:04.549
 it can be done with lots of materials ea 

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:08.090
 depending on the material in source it will be more 

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:10.310
 or less of quality for example to make a 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:14.000
 example a kitchen can be made in 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:17.060
 plywood or steel in wood 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:20.000
 the same thing is a bit like cardboard 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:22.790
 final on facilities can be done 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.340
 with a poor material like resin 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:27.680
 that we use only for the 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:29.599
 temporary bridge or with a 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:34.129
 a little more refined material 

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:35.690
 the composite or with a nice material 

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:38.420
 which can also be ceramic metal 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:41.480
 that is, pottery or many supported 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:44.060
 heel vos 8 or you can do with the 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:48.019
 absolute best material that it 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:50.930
 zirconium ceramic that ceramics without 

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:53.750
 in elementary school under black but it is supported 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:57.049
 from a zirconium core that is a metal 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:59.359
 all ours are completely white 

00:02:57.049 --> 00:03:01.910
 bridges are made right with this 

00:02:59.359 --> 00:03:04.489
 material that the top is called zigoni 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:07.250
 ceramics that the most precious material 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:09.230
 absolutely with which today we can 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:11.599
 build teeth 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:13.880
 obviously the costs of this material 

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:16.010
 as far as the bridge is concerned 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:19.160
 definitive are generally in Italy 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:22.639
 the implantology 200 are still very high 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:24.680
 has recently purchased five computers 5 

00:03:22.639 --> 00:03:29.180
 predators just to work this out 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:30.829
 precious metal and we are able to propose it 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:34.000
 a patient ie in quotation marks a 

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:37.280
 sell it to the patient at the cost of 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:40.629
 dental laboratory that is how much 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:44.569
 I pay I have it to you patients 

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:47.330
 a really low piece in relation 

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:50.269
 to the immense quality of this material 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:53.480
 therefore today the patient must demand 

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:56.360
 a very high quality material in 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:58.940
 how modern techniques allow us 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:02.060
 to build bridges other than yellows 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:03.260
 scono do not age do not break and 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:04.909
 they are internal 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:07.060
 precisely with this material that it 

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:10.489
 zirconium ceramic that tops 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:13.640
 the power of my 100 implantology 

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:16.160
 cannizzo studio is in the amount of 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:18.560
 cases carried out every year that is thousands and 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:20.449
 thousands and this allows us to 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:23.840
 treat the patient like no one 

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:26.270
 could do I thank you from my heart 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:27.590
 I loved communicating 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:32.650
 this news 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:32.650
 thanks again to everyone and a good smile
