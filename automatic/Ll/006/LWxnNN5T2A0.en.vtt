00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.929
 you have a hero and today I will 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:06.089
 tell you about how 

00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:08.250
 set my builds on minecraft 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:11.130
 what have the usual most ordinary 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:13.500
 vanilla launcher and this is new 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:16.230
 the launcher is the one that does not require for 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.420
 of my work now you about everything 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.580
 look carefully at your hands 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.920
 first we need to create a new one 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:27.900
 Letâ€™s let's call her profile 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:29.929
 rpb so here is actually the name 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.719
 doesn't matter 

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:35.219
 next we need to choose a version here 

00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:38.190
 164 release it means that we are now 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:41.129
 run minecraft 164 on with you 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:44.300
 build the most important build 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:47.460
 only works on version seven and you 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:49.230
 accordingly, new launcher works 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.050
 on the eighth version of java that us 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.899
 totally disagree what does 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.969
 need to do the first delete click 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.379
 here is a button and somewhere was right here and 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.620
 delete this line 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:05.189
 Further further quite simply here 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:07.619
 insert the path to our 7 Yaver on 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:10.080
 default java 7 on windows 7 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.720
 set along this path and therefore 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:16.049
 this line is required to indicate 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:19.110
 where is exe file 7 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:21.810
 I you I will give you in the description under this video 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.729
 but it only fits with a layer if 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.070
 java is installed under windows 7 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.780
 and only if she you install it 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.420
 wherever she is trying to get 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.820
 the default is very simple and clear it 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.700
 very important 5 7 should i experience key 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.470
 the java argument is already just on it 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.320
 voucher and do not work as far as I understood 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:43.170
 maybe new java arguments will appear 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.990
 so you can forget about the stage 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:49.110
 ready now we need to specify the game 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:52.320
 directory where to get it 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:54.689
 derek how to say this is the way who and folders 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:58.200
 where will your assembly be ? 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:02:00.899
 I recommend installing the entire assembly in 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.909
 a separate folder then you can 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:06.659
 install multiple builds on version 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:08.190
 minecraft 164 by default you it either 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:10.110
 will not work or will be different 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.500
 inconvenience arises with shorter so 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.560
 better believe 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:16.930
 in my case, the path to this folder crash 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.990
 This is the important moment at the end. 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:21.400
 there should not be a slasher 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:23.320
 just open your explorer 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:26.020
 mikroft in conductor let me even you 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:30.750
 show standard where this file path 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:34.450
 let's find for example let's open factorial 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:38.620
 folder no we need here standard 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:44.580
 kind of program and we need a conductor 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:46.989
 where is web web font is a second 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:49.000
 just go for it 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:51.580
 standard conductors in the right folder and 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.890
 here kapi kapi right-click 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:56.200
 click on the title and copy the address 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:58.570
 everything is very simple and clear insert 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.200
 here make sure that there is no slasher at the end 

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:01.630
 this one 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.430
 oblique sticks and all we have now 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:06.010
 correctly built-in push saif 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:07.900
 the profile further we choose 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:10.630
 profile gender pg2 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:13.120

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:14.380
 press the play button we need one 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.480
 time to start 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:19.060
 completely standard vanilla 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:20.860
 minecraft version 164 will be 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:22.930
 created for all necessary files which 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:24.640
 we will be useful in the future of course 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:27.420

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:29.200
