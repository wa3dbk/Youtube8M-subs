now<00:00:22.949> I<00:00:22.980> was<00:00:23.189> just<00:00:23.220> thinking<00:00:23.760> what<00:00:24.539> are<00:00:24.689> we

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
now I was just thinking what are we

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.349 
now I was just thinking what are we
doing<00:00:25.170> today<00:00:25.350> well<00:00:25.769> I<00:00:25.800> was<00:00:26.010> thinking<00:00:26.369> that<00:00:26.609> we

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
doing today well I was thinking that we

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.519 
doing today well I was thinking that we
should<00:00:27.390> do<00:00:27.630> Alvin's<00:00:28.880> Alvin's<00:00:29.960> quests<00:00:30.960> and

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
then I was thinking again maybe we

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.690 
then I was thinking again maybe we
shouldn't<00:00:33.450> do<00:00:33.600> it<00:00:33.770> so<00:00:34.770> I<00:00:34.800> mean<00:00:35.100> I'm<00:00:35.340> really

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700
