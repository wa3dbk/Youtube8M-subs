here<00:00:01.319> in<00:00:01.439> Vancouver<00:00:02.010> to<00:00:02.340> show<00:00:02.820> how<00:00:03.120> to<00:00:03.179> cook

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:03.540 
here in Vancouver to show how to cook

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:05.660 
here in Vancouver to show how to cook
with<00:00:03.840> the<00:00:03.929> rapid<00:00:04.259> stove<00:00:04.529> using<00:00:05.190> biomass

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:05.670 
with the rapid stove using biomass

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:11.560 
with the rapid stove using biomass
briquettes<00:00:07.940> cook<00:00:08.940> a<00:00:09.240> simple<00:00:09.900> soup<00:00:10.490> and

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:11.570 
briquettes cook a simple soup and

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:14.780 
briquettes cook a simple soup and
hopefully<00:00:12.570> we're<00:00:12.840> going<00:00:13.019> to<00:00:13.110> use<00:00:13.429> not<00:00:14.429> more

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
hopefully we're going to use not more

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:20.870 
hopefully we're going to use not more
than<00:00:15.059> four<00:00:15.570> briquettes<00:00:17.359> so<00:00:18.359> first<00:00:18.750> I<00:00:19.609> have<00:00:20.609> to

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
than four briquettes so first I have to

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.890 
than four briquettes so first I have to
make<00:00:21.029> a<00:00:21.060> fire<00:00:21.769> and<00:00:22.789> we<00:00:23.789> make<00:00:24.029> it<00:00:24.269> with

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:26.900 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:31.630 

some<00:00:27.500> paper<00:00:27.830> or<00:00:28.190> just<00:00:28.520> some<00:00:30.340> some<00:00:31.340> meshed

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:31.640 
some paper or just some some meshed

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:36.820 
some paper or just some some meshed
briquettes<00:00:32.240> start<00:00:33.050> the<00:00:33.170> fire<00:00:35.560> just<00:00:36.560> going<00:00:36.740> to

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:36.830 
briquettes start the fire just going to

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:47.770 
briquettes start the fire just going to
use<00:00:36.950> this<00:00:37.070> big<00:00:41.170> use<00:00:42.170> some<00:00:42.470> small<00:00:42.680> community

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:47.780 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:01:29.870 

and<00:00:48.950> insert<00:00:49.950> the<00:00:50.280> briquette

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:40.030 

sir

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:40.040 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.950 

so<00:01:41.040> we<00:01:41.310> can<00:01:41.460> see<00:01:41.700> that<00:01:41.880> the<00:01:41.970> fires<00:01:42.270> coming<00:01:42.690> now

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
so we can see that the fires coming now

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:48.260 
so we can see that the fires coming now
through<00:01:43.320> the<00:01:43.440> hole<00:01:45.230> and<00:01:46.460> it<00:01:47.460> ignited<00:01:47.940> the

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
through the hole and it ignited the

00:01:48.270 --> 00:02:06.450 
through the hole and it ignited the
briquette<00:01:54.050> I'm<00:01:55.050> going<00:01:55.230> to<00:01:55.290> use<00:01:55.440> a<00:01:55.470> small

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:06.460 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:11.590 

we<00:02:07.460> can<00:02:07.670> see<00:02:07.970> now<00:02:08.210> that<00:02:08.619> the<00:02:09.619> whole<00:02:10.330> whole<00:02:11.330> of

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:11.600 
we can see now that the whole whole of

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:16.240 
we can see now that the whole whole of
the<00:02:11.750> briquette<00:02:12.140> is<00:02:12.170> on<00:02:12.500> fire<00:02:14.680> so<00:02:15.680> we're<00:02:16.070> going

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
the briquette is on fire so we're going

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:28.720 
the briquette is on fire so we're going
to<00:02:16.310> add<00:02:17.080> another<00:02:18.080> briquette<00:02:18.890> right<00:02:19.220> in<00:02:27.580> so<00:02:28.580> we

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
to add another briquette right in so we

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:32.470 
to add another briquette right in so we
can<00:02:28.880> see<00:02:29.150> now<00:02:29.390> that<00:02:30.790> because<00:02:31.790> of<00:02:31.910> the<00:02:32.030> second

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 
can see now that because of the second

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:37.630 
can see now that because of the second
briquette<00:02:32.900> in<00:02:33.340> the<00:02:34.340> fire<00:02:34.810> retain<00:02:36.040> its<00:02:37.040> flames

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640 
briquette in the fire retain its flames

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.240 
briquette in the fire retain its flames
in<00:02:38.510> the<00:02:38.570> first<00:02:38.930> briquette<00:02:39.440> that<00:02:39.680> we<00:02:39.890> inserted

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
in the first briquette that we inserted

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:42.790 
in the first briquette that we inserted
before<00:02:40.550> and<00:02:40.970> now<00:02:41.600> we<00:02:41.660> can<00:02:42.050> see<00:02:42.320> the<00:02:42.530> fire

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:42.800 
before and now we can see the fire

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:48.010 
before and now we can see the fire
coming<00:02:43.160> along<00:02:44.530> the<00:02:45.530> second<00:02:45.920> briquette<00:02:47.020> both

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:48.020 
coming along the second briquette both

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:51.550 
coming along the second briquette both
briquettes<00:02:48.620> are<00:02:48.920> now<00:02:49.100> on<00:02:49.280> fire<00:02:49.580> and<00:02:50.380> we<00:02:51.380> can

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
briquettes are now on fire and we can

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:59.260 
briquettes are now on fire and we can
see<00:02:51.830> almost<00:02:52.100> no<00:02:52.370> smoke<00:02:52.730> coming<00:02:52.760> out<00:02:58.270> having

00:02:59.260 --> 00:02:59.270 
see almost no smoke coming out having

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:01.480 
see almost no smoke coming out having
smaller<00:02:59.660> briquettes<00:03:00.170> in<00:03:00.470> this<00:03:00.740> case<00:03:00.980> is<00:03:01.190> good

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:01.490 
smaller briquettes in this case is good

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:04.600 
smaller briquettes in this case is good
because<00:03:01.870> the<00:03:02.870> second<00:03:03.260> briquette<00:03:03.620> put<00:03:04.100> in<00:03:04.310> the

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:04.610 
because the second briquette put in the

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:08.979 
because the second briquette put in the
stove<00:03:05.650> actually<00:03:06.650> ignites<00:03:07.450> the<00:03:08.450> first<00:03:08.750> one

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:08.989 
stove actually ignites the first one

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:14.949 
stove actually ignites the first one
even<00:03:09.290> more<00:03:09.530> and<00:03:09.850> keeps<00:03:10.850> it<00:03:11.030> on<00:03:11.180> fire<00:03:13.750> we<00:03:14.750> can

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:14.959 
even more and keeps it on fire we can

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:18.070 
even more and keeps it on fire we can
see<00:03:15.200> the<00:03:15.350> lantern<00:03:15.890> now<00:03:16.100> rolling<00:03:16.489> boil<00:03:17.080> after

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:18.080 
see the lantern now rolling boil after

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:22.210 
see the lantern now rolling boil after
not<00:03:18.830> even<00:03:19.989> half<00:03:20.989> of<00:03:21.170> the<00:03:21.320> briquettes<00:03:21.769> were

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.220 
not even half of the briquettes were

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:28.240 
not even half of the briquettes were
being<00:03:22.489> burned<00:03:23.769> and<00:03:26.110> means<00:03:27.110> we're<00:03:28.070> already

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
being burned and means we're already

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:32.170 
being burned and means we're already
done<00:03:28.850> and<00:03:29.180> we<00:03:29.390> would<00:03:29.600> be<00:03:29.780> done<00:03:30.670> over<00:03:31.670> you<00:03:32.000> eat

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:32.180 
done and we would be done over you eat

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:36.520 
done and we would be done over you eat
one<00:03:32.450> briquette<00:03:34.000> so<00:03:35.000> we<00:03:35.150> match<00:03:35.420> to<00:03:35.840> cook<00:03:36.110> the

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:36.530 
one briquette so we match to cook the

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:41.869 
one briquette so we match to cook the
lantern<00:03:37.070> in<00:03:38.830> three<00:03:39.830> to<00:03:40.010> four<00:03:40.280> minutes

00:03:41.869 --> 00:03:41.879 
lantern in three to four minutes

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:44.270 
lantern in three to four minutes
without<00:03:42.750> burning<00:03:43.379> even<00:03:43.709> half<00:03:43.980> of<00:03:44.010> the

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
without burning even half of the

00:03:44.280 --> 00:04:03.630 
without burning even half of the
briquettes

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:03.640 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:05.880 

the<00:04:03.940> steady<00:04:04.270> air<00:04:04.569> flow<00:04:04.930> going<00:04:05.110> on<00:04:05.470> in<00:04:05.740> the

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:05.890 
the steady air flow going on in the

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:12.930 
the steady air flow going on in the
stove<00:04:07.290> don't<00:04:08.290> have<00:04:08.650> to<00:04:09.150> manage<00:04:10.150> the<00:04:10.420> fire<00:04:11.940> just

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:12.940 
stove don't have to manage the fire just

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:16.229 
stove don't have to manage the fire just
takes<00:04:13.300> on<00:04:13.600> by<00:04:13.810> itself<00:04:14.580> if<00:04:15.580> you<00:04:15.640> really<00:04:16.090> have<00:04:16.209> a

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:16.239 
takes on by itself if you really have a

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:18.360 
takes on by itself if you really have a
good<00:04:16.480> insulated<00:04:17.260> combustion<00:04:17.799> chamber<00:04:18.220> the

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:18.370 
good insulated combustion chamber the

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:23.220 
good insulated combustion chamber the
fire<00:04:18.609> will<00:04:18.850> go<00:04:18.880> on<00:04:20.040> with<00:04:21.040> very<00:04:21.489> small<00:04:22.230> fuel

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:23.230 
fire will go on with very small fuel

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:36.520 
fire will go on with very small fuel
input

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:36.530 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:39.140 

so<00:04:37.530> while<00:04:37.800> we<00:04:38.070> were<00:04:38.190> eating<00:04:38.430> the<00:04:38.790> briquettes

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:39.150 
so while we were eating the briquettes

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:44.000 
so while we were eating the briquettes
were<00:04:39.800> burning<00:04:40.800> down<00:04:41.040> and<00:04:42.710> they're<00:04:43.710> going<00:04:43.889> to

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:44.010 
were burning down and they're going to

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:49.310 
were burning down and they're going to
soon<00:04:44.370> turn<00:04:44.880> to<00:04:45.240> dust<00:04:47.750> there's<00:04:48.750> still<00:04:49.020> some

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:49.320 
soon turn to dust there's still some

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:53.150 
soon turn to dust there's still some
left<00:04:50.660> according<00:04:51.660> to<00:04:51.840> the<00:04:52.050> last<00:04:52.230> tests<00:04:52.860> in

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:53.160 
left according to the last tests in

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:56.600 
left according to the last tests in
Aprovecho<00:04:54.470> the<00:04:55.470> briquettes<00:04:55.860> when<00:04:56.160> when<00:04:56.430> they

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:56.610 
Aprovecho the briquettes when when they

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:59.360 
Aprovecho the briquettes when when they
are<00:04:56.820> dying<00:04:57.360> out<00:04:57.830> they<00:04:58.830> become<00:04:59.130> really

00:04:59.360 --> 00:04:59.370 
are dying out they become really

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:03.159

dangerous because of the CEOs emissions
only<00:05:04.169> if<00:05:04.260> possible<00:05:05.150> we<00:05:06.150> have<00:05:06.180> to<00:05:06.450> shut<00:05:06.960> off<00:05:07.200> the

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:07.740 
only if possible we have to shut off the

only if possible we have to shut off the
door<00:05:08.630> to<00:05:09.830> limit<00:05:10.830> the<00:05:11.669> excess<00:05:12.120> air<00:05:12.390> coming<00:05:12.840> in

door to limit the excess air coming in
which<00:05:14.400> will<00:05:14.610> keep<00:05:14.880> the<00:05:15.150> combustion<00:05:15.540> chamber

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:16.050 
which will keep the combustion chamber

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:19.250

really<00:05:16.380> hot<00:05:16.650> and<00:05:17.210> making<00:05:18.210> all<00:05:18.540> the<00:05:18.840> gases

really hot and making all the gases

really hot and making all the gases
burned<00:05:19.680> much<00:05:20.190> better<00:05:20.520> than<00:05:20.910> otherwise<00:05:22.340> the
