about<00:01:12.750> backup<00:01:13.350> is<00:01:13.560> that<00:01:14.159> it<00:01:14.490> just<00:01:14.700> works<00:01:14.939> and

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
about backup is that it just works and

about backup is that it just works and
it<00:01:15.330> doesn't<00:01:15.600> incrementally<00:01:16.320> so<00:01:16.680> after<00:01:17.009> your

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
it doesn't incrementally so after your

already better ways to do this there's

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.230 
already better ways to do this there's
of<00:01:26.759> course<00:01:26.790> time<00:01:27.479> machine<00:01:28.820> no<00:01:29.820> that's<00:01:30.000> not<00:01:30.180> it

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
of course time machine no that's not it

hold on no that's not it either that's

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.499 
hold on no that's not it either that's
different<00:01:35.640> at<00:01:35.909> it<00:01:36.619> ere<00:01:37.619> we<00:01:37.770> go<00:01:37.799> okay<00:01:38.520> so<00:01:38.909> time

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
different at it ere we go okay so time

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.319 
different at it ere we go okay so time
machine<00:01:39.930> is<00:01:40.369> basically<00:01:41.369> built<00:01:41.640> into<00:01:42.030> leopard

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
machine is basically built into leopard

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.480 
machine is basically built into leopard
and<00:01:42.479> it<00:01:42.930> works<00:01:43.079> automatically<00:01:43.619> you<00:01:44.070> just<00:01:44.340> have

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
and it works automatically you just have

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.039 
and it works automatically you just have
to<00:01:44.640> give<00:01:44.670> it<00:01:44.790> an<00:01:44.970> external<00:01:45.479> dedicated<00:01:45.899> hard

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
to give it an external dedicated hard

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.749 
to give it an external dedicated hard
drive<00:01:46.229> and<00:01:46.439> it<00:01:46.950> will<00:01:47.040> automatically<00:01:47.490> backup

your<00:01:48.030> stuff<00:01:48.119> now<00:01:48.420> it's<00:01:48.750> pretty<00:01:48.960> brutal<00:01:49.200> first

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
your stuff now it's pretty brutal first

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.139 
your stuff now it's pretty brutal first
time<00:01:49.770> you<00:01:49.890> run<00:01:50.009> it<00:01:50.159> because<00:01:50.640> what<00:01:50.850> you<00:01:50.970> should

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
time you run it because what you should

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:52.429 
time you run it because what you should
do<00:01:51.270> is<00:01:51.390> just<00:01:51.540> help<00:01:51.720> to<00:01:51.810> back<00:01:51.960> up<00:01:52.140> your<00:01:52.170> entire

do is just help to back up your entire

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.859 
do is just help to back up your entire
computer<00:01:53.009> and<00:01:53.460> this<00:01:54.149> means<00:01:54.329> backing<00:01:54.780> up

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
computer and this means backing up

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.690 
computer and this means backing up
gigabytes<00:01:55.409> of<00:01:55.530> data<00:01:55.710> it's<00:01:56.280> the<00:01:56.369> first<00:01:56.579> time

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
gigabytes of data it's the first time

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.819 
gigabytes of data it's the first time
you're<00:01:56.820> on<00:01:56.969> it<00:01:57.090> do<00:01:57.329> it<00:01:57.479> overnight<00:01:57.689> but<00:01:58.560> then

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
you're on it do it overnight but then

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.830 
you're on it do it overnight but then
after<00:01:59.460> that<00:01:59.549> it's<00:01:59.790> only<00:02:00.000> backing<00:02:00.420> up<00:02:00.570> what's

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
after that it's only backing up what's

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.090 
after that it's only backing up what's
absolutely<00:02:01.049> necessary<00:02:01.229> and<00:02:01.680> it<00:02:01.799> will<00:02:01.890> do<00:02:01.979> it

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
absolutely necessary and it will do it

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.770 
absolutely necessary and it will do it
an<00:02:02.189> hourly<00:02:02.610> basis<00:02:02.969> to<00:02:03.390> the<00:02:03.479> great<00:02:03.600> thing<00:02:03.750> about

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
an hourly basis to the great thing about

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.600 
an hourly basis to the great thing about
this<00:02:04.079> is<00:02:04.140> not<00:02:04.409> only<00:02:04.469> is<00:02:04.860> it<00:02:04.890> protecting<00:02:05.189> your

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
this is not only is it protecting your

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.700 
this is not only is it protecting your
data<00:02:05.700> but<00:02:06.329> say<00:02:06.570> if<00:02:06.630> you<00:02:06.780> make<00:02:07.079> a<00:02:07.110> mistake<00:02:07.200> and

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
data but say if you make a mistake and

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:08.719 
data but say if you make a mistake and
you<00:02:07.770> want<00:02:07.920> to<00:02:07.979> revert<00:02:08.190> to<00:02:08.220> an<00:02:08.369> older<00:02:08.580> version

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
you want to revert to an older version

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.760 
you want to revert to an older version
you<00:02:09.270> usually<00:02:09.360> have<00:02:09.750> one<00:02:09.959> that's<00:02:10.080> no<00:02:10.440> more<00:02:10.619> than

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
you usually have one that's no more than

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.670 
you usually have one that's no more than
an<00:02:10.890> hour<00:02:11.009> to<00:02:11.220> old<00:02:11.700> so<00:02:12.390> it's<00:02:12.510> very<00:02:12.629> useful

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
an hour to old so it's very useful

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.979 
an hour to old so it's very useful
now<00:02:14.069> archiving<00:02:14.939> is<00:02:15.000> kind<00:02:15.299> of<00:02:15.480> the<00:02:15.569> same<00:02:15.719> type

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:15.989 
now archiving is kind of the same type

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:17.449 
now archiving is kind of the same type
of<00:02:16.019> thing<00:02:16.170> so<00:02:16.590> if<00:02:16.650> you<00:02:16.739> usually<00:02:16.829> don't<00:02:17.099> do<00:02:17.310> it

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
of thing so if you usually don't do it

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:18.949 
of thing so if you usually don't do it
as<00:02:17.549> often<00:02:17.700> and<00:02:17.939> usually<00:02:18.090> do<00:02:18.359> it<00:02:18.450> to<00:02:18.540> permanent

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
as often and usually do it to permanent

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:22.339 
as often and usually do it to permanent
media<00:02:19.170> like<00:02:19.680> a<00:02:19.890> CD<00:02:20.280> or<00:02:20.310> dvd<00:02:20.909> so<00:02:21.569> all<00:02:21.840> max<00:02:22.140> for<00:02:22.319> a

00:02:22.339 --> 00:02:22.349 
media like a CD or dvd so all max for a

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:24.770 
media like a CD or dvd so all max for a
while<00:02:22.439> now<00:02:22.469> come<00:02:22.980> with<00:02:23.129> CD<00:02:23.579> burners<00:02:23.939> or<00:02:24.150> DVD

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
while now come with CD burners or DVD

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.780 
while now come with CD burners or DVD
burners<00:02:25.140> in<00:02:25.170> them<00:02:25.409> so<00:02:26.159> all<00:02:26.280> you<00:02:26.370> need<00:02:26.400> to<00:02:26.579> do<00:02:26.670> is

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
burners in them so all you need to do is

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:30.559 
burners in them so all you need to do is
buy<00:02:26.939> yourself<00:02:27.269> a<00:02:27.329> stack<00:02:27.750> of<00:02:28.609> dvds<00:02:29.609> and<00:02:29.909> i

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:30.569 
buy yourself a stack of dvds and i

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:31.849 
buy yourself a stack of dvds and i
usually<00:02:30.870> just<00:02:30.900> get<00:02:31.170> them<00:02:31.349> pick<00:02:31.530> them<00:02:31.620> up<00:02:31.680> with

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:31.859 
usually just get them pick them up with

00:02:31.859 --> 00:02:34.069 
usually just get them pick them up with
spool<00:02:32.250> and<00:02:32.549> you<00:02:32.819> can<00:02:32.939> get<00:02:33.060> them<00:02:33.180> at<00:02:33.209> pennies<00:02:33.870> a

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:34.079 
spool and you can get them at pennies a

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:36.289 
spool and you can get them at pennies a
CD<00:02:34.560> or<00:02:34.590> pennies<00:02:34.980> of<00:02:35.040> DVD<00:02:35.459> so<00:02:36.030> really<00:02:36.209> they

00:02:36.289 --> 00:02:36.299 
CD or pennies of DVD so really they

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:38.089 
CD or pennies of DVD so really they
don't<00:02:36.450> cost<00:02:36.629> very<00:02:36.750> much<00:02:36.900> and<00:02:37.200> then<00:02:37.680> what<00:02:37.980> I<00:02:38.010> do

00:02:38.089 --> 00:02:38.099 
don't cost very much and then what I do

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:39.949 
don't cost very much and then what I do
is<00:02:38.219> I<00:02:38.430> take<00:02:38.579> my<00:02:38.760> documents<00:02:39.269> folder<00:02:39.299> and<00:02:39.689> every

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 
is I take my documents folder and every

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:42.110 
is I take my documents folder and every
once<00:02:40.139> in<00:02:40.290> a<00:02:40.319> while<00:02:40.469> I<00:02:40.650> burn<00:02:41.010> that<00:02:41.219> to<00:02:41.400> a<00:02:41.430> DVD<00:02:41.670> or

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
once in a while I burn that to a DVD or

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:43.699 
once in a while I burn that to a DVD or
if<00:02:42.569> there's<00:02:42.750> a<00:02:42.810> specific<00:02:42.989> project<00:02:43.439> I'm

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
if there's a specific project I'm

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:45.710 
if there's a specific project I'm
working<00:02:43.739> on<00:02:44.129> and<00:02:44.400> say<00:02:44.849> I've<00:02:45.120> just<00:02:45.359> completed

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
working on and say I've just completed

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.960 
working on and say I've just completed
it<00:02:45.930> I'll<00:02:46.139> burn<00:02:46.560> just<00:02:46.859> that<00:02:47.040> project<00:02:47.489> to<00:02:47.579> a<00:02:47.609> CD

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
it I'll burn just that project to a CD

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.720 
it I'll burn just that project to a CD
or<00:02:48.000> dvd<00:02:48.650> sometimes<00:02:49.650> I<00:02:49.799> actually<00:02:49.889> burn<00:02:50.159> two

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
or dvd sometimes I actually burn two

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.220 
or dvd sometimes I actually burn two
copies<00:02:51.180> and<00:02:51.359> put<00:02:51.840> them<00:02:51.959> in<00:02:52.049> different

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
copies and put them in different

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.619 
copies and put them in different
locations<00:02:52.650> it's<00:02:53.430> always<00:02:53.609> a<00:02:53.700> good<00:02:53.939> idea<00:02:54.000> maybe

00:02:54.619 --> 00:02:54.629 
locations it's always a good idea maybe

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:55.970 
locations it's always a good idea maybe
to<00:02:54.900> prevent<00:02:55.169> against<00:02:55.379> something

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
to prevent against something

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.129 
to prevent against something
catastrophic<00:02:56.310> like<00:02:56.879> a<00:02:56.909> fire<00:02:57.239> to<00:02:57.900> have<00:02:58.109> a

00:02:58.129 --> 00:02:58.139 
catastrophic like a fire to have a

00:02:58.139 --> 00:03:00.409 
catastrophic like a fire to have a
backup<00:02:58.439> somewhere<00:02:58.799> out<00:02:59.010> so<00:02:59.370> maybe<00:03:00.090> at<00:03:00.389> a

00:03:00.409 --> 00:03:00.419 
backup somewhere out so maybe at a

00:03:00.419 --> 00:03:02.420

archiving<00:03:06.359> is<00:03:06.419> a<00:03:06.450> great<00:03:06.599> thing<00:03:06.810> too<00:03:07.019> because

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:07.169 
archiving is a great thing too because

00:03:07.169 --> 00:03:08.750 
archiving is a great thing too because
it<00:03:07.349> allows<00:03:07.530> you<00:03:07.650> then<00:03:07.739> to<00:03:07.799> clear<00:03:08.159> off<00:03:08.340> space<00:03:08.579> on

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
it allows you then to clear off space on

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:09.949 
it allows you then to clear off space on
your<00:03:08.790> hard<00:03:08.909> drive<00:03:09.209> when<00:03:09.450> you're<00:03:09.540> really<00:03:09.840> done

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959 
your hard drive when you're really done

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:11.059 
your hard drive when you're really done
with<00:03:09.989> the<00:03:10.139> project<00:03:10.290> and<00:03:10.650> know<00:03:10.769> that<00:03:10.950> you've

00:03:11.059 --> 00:03:11.069 
with the project and know that you've

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:12.649 
with the project and know that you've
got<00:03:11.250> probably<00:03:11.579> two<00:03:11.700> copies<00:03:12.209> of<00:03:12.299> it<00:03:12.419> elsewhere

00:03:12.649 --> 00:03:12.659 
got probably two copies of it elsewhere

it now if you want to back up even

00:03:16.889 --> 00:03:18.619 
it now if you want to back up even
better<00:03:17.129> then<00:03:17.819> you<00:03:17.940> probably<00:03:18.120> want<00:03:18.389> to<00:03:18.449> do<00:03:18.510> it

00:03:18.619 --> 00:03:18.629 
better then you probably want to do it
