00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:09.630
 then a great day of sport 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:12.540
 today on the vallelunga circuit 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:15.330
 for the third seasonal appointment with 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.100
 the civ and the italian championship of 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.980
 speed 2013 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:22.710
 starting from the premier class the class 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.990
 superbike true fiammetta yes lorenzo with 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.359
 eddy the marra that was confirmed later 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.890
 having signed the pole he managed to 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.750
 win the victory ahead of 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.149
 michele magnoni and with ivan goi that 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.489
 just in the last stages he climbed over 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.500
 the Argentine market conquered therefore 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:41.219
 the third position and relegating market 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:44.760
 winner of the two races at mugello in 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.899
 fourth place was truly a 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.600
 perfect race we did a good one 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:51.480
 just step all the 38 really a 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.320
 quite satisfactory step with the 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.170
 race tires that I did not expect 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.820
 because those like the mother like the race 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.070
 it was a little bit worse 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:02.969
 qualification I failed to exploit 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:06.869
 the rubber for some time but they wanted from 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:09.150
 same went well however it is like 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.610
 like how I expected 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.979
 I thought I was taking the step a little more 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.070
 tall instead it is really good I did 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.080
 everything in the 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:19.570
 in perfection so it went well 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:21.700
 well then but the show is 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:24.580
 continued also in the small one 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:27.370
 displacement in the moto3 indeed there are 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:29.979
 been great great pilots and great 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:32.200
 protagonists also in this category 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:35.229
 luca marini started from pole position 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:37.060
 remained in command for several laps 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:38.770
 but then he had to give way 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:40.900
 settle for the second step with 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:43.210
 stefano valtulini instead 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:44.950
 won the victory and the third 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:46.840
 position went to the mahindra but to 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:49.690
 surprise not to that of locatelli that 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:52.479
 instead he had won race 1 at mugello but 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:54.789
 that of rinaldi but full of strokes of 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:57.640
 the stock class was also 600 

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:59.770
 that which cultivates the nursery of the 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.700
 most promising drivers in the field 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:02.800
 national 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:05.110
 tell us a little about how it happened so lorenzo 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:07.000
 it was a very tight race perhaps 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:09.399
 it was more tightly fought in terms of numbers 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.920
 number of pilots fighting for the 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:13.239
 victory formed a train of one 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.690
 about ten pilots enclosed in a few 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:19.120
 seconds with the final sprint victory at 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:20.799
 finish line went to luca salvadori that 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.790
 among other things he was very happy with this 

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:25.370
 success because all 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.810
 at the international stage in Monza 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:28.549
 he had seen his victory fade away 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:29.870
 actually the last corner then the 

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:31.400
 The victory was taken away from the table 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:33.560
 here in vallelunga because it was 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.870
 disqualified during checks and 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:38.840
 then on the top step of the podium 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:41.599
 salt now andrea tucci with the second 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:44.060
 position of gennaro sabatino e nicola 

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:44.709
 from the fourth quarter inherits the third 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:48.230
 position 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:51.139
 then dulcis in fundo la supersport 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:53.120
 fiammetta gara I would say worthy conclusion 

00:02:51.139 --> 00:02:55.510
 of the class package that 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:58.129
 make up the civ with a duel 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:00.049
 amazing between cruciani and dionisi that 

00:02:58.129 --> 00:03:01.189
 they were also level on points in the league and 

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:03.079
 also in this case they were 

00:03:01.189 --> 00:03:04.370
 beautiful sparks because they are 

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:06.200
 arrived here at vallelunga with one 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:09.169
 victory and a second place each 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:10.760
 conquered just at mugello and no one 

00:03:09.169 --> 00:03:13.340
 of the two he wanted to leave not even a meter 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:15.169
 to the other then they are compared 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:18.409
 until the end with dionisi among other things 

00:03:15.169 --> 00:03:20.569
 that did not start very well virtual of 

00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:22.909
 not excellent qualifications for which he has 

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:25.099
 recovered right up to undermine 

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:27.079
 cruciani eventually shut down separately 

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:29.510
 of a few thousandths with cruciani primo 

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:32.569
 ilario dionisi second on the circuit of 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:34.729
 home and the third surprise position of 

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:38.120
 faccane in front of the author of the pole e 

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:40.370
 gregorini shideye i did i went 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:42.979
 in my head some rounds I tried to 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:45.859
 manage or make all the deficient come out 

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:48.799
 I felt behind you a little reward I 

00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:50.540
 tried not to make mistakes and to bring 

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:52.400
 home victory 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:54.870
 an important victory all here at 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:57.120
 cause of lario 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:58.769
 two years always won him though me 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:00.480
