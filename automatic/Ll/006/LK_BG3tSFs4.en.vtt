00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:11.730 
would kind of make sense to me however

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:13.819 
would kind of make sense to me however
let's<00:04:12.000> say<00:04:12.389> that<00:04:12.690> grand<00:04:13.319> theft<00:04:13.380> out<00:04:13.590> of<00:04:13.680> 5<00:04:13.799> for

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:13.829 
let's say that grand theft out of 5 for

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:15.979 
let's say that grand theft out of 5 for
next-gen<00:04:14.579> is<00:04:14.760> just<00:04:15.030> a<00:04:15.150> huge<00:04:15.389> rumor<00:04:15.720> and<00:04:15.900> it's

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:15.989 
next-gen is just a huge rumor and it's

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:17.659 
next-gen is just a huge rumor and it's
never<00:04:16.200> going<00:04:16.349> to<00:04:16.410> happen<00:04:16.470> this<00:04:17.160> could<00:04:17.340> also<00:04:17.489> be

00:04:17.659 --> 00:04:17.669 
never going to happen this could also be

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:19.339 
never going to happen this could also be
about<00:04:18.000> other<00:04:18.209> things<00:04:18.570> take<00:04:18.840> two<00:04:19.019> could<00:04:19.229> be

00:04:19.339 --> 00:04:19.349 
about other things take two could be

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:21.650 
about other things take two could be
there<00:04:19.739> to<00:04:20.039> potentially<00:04:20.940> announce<00:04:21.389> the<00:04:21.539> next

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:21.660 
there to potentially announce the next

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:23.690 
there to potentially announce the next
bully<00:04:21.989> game<00:04:22.349> the<00:04:22.890> next<00:04:23.039> red<00:04:23.400> dead<00:04:23.550> redemption

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:23.700 
bully game the next red dead redemption

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:26.390 
bully game the next red dead redemption
game<00:04:24.270> any<00:04:24.720> of<00:04:24.990> rockstars<00:04:25.470> series<00:04:26.010> or<00:04:26.159> maybe

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400 
game any of rockstars series or maybe

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:27.150 
game any of rockstars series or maybe
even<00:04:26.490> a<00:04:26.760> brain

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:27.160 
even a brain

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:28.860 
even a brain
new<00:04:27.220> games<00:04:27.460> so<00:04:27.670> it<00:04:27.760> doesn't<00:04:28.030> necessarily<00:04:28.570> have

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:28.870 
new games so it doesn't necessarily have

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:30.930 
new games so it doesn't necessarily have
to<00:04:28.900> be<00:04:29.110> grand<00:04:29.410> theft<00:04:29.560> out<00:04:29.710> of<00:04:29.800> 5<00:04:29.980> you<00:04:30.820> know

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:30.940 
to be grand theft out of 5 you know

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:32.190 
to be grand theft out of 5 you know
there's<00:04:31.180> a<00:04:31.270> chance<00:04:31.540> that<00:04:31.630> maybe<00:04:31.990> this

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:32.200 
there's a chance that maybe this

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:33.750 
there's a chance that maybe this
information<00:04:32.770> is<00:04:32.890> a<00:04:32.950> little<00:04:33.190> incorrect<00:04:33.580> and

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:33.760 
information is a little incorrect and

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:35.160 
information is a little incorrect and
it's<00:04:33.880> about<00:04:34.030> a<00:04:34.060> completely<00:04:34.660> different<00:04:35.110> game

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:35.170 
it's about a completely different game

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:37.380 
it's about a completely different game
either<00:04:35.800> way<00:04:36.160> this<00:04:36.670> is<00:04:36.850> pretty<00:04:37.000> exciting

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:37.390 
either way this is pretty exciting

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:40.020 
either way this is pretty exciting
information<00:04:37.660> III<00:04:38.530> is<00:04:38.680> only<00:04:38.860> one<00:04:39.580> month<00:04:39.760> away<00:04:39.910> I

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:40.030
