what<00:00:56.700> can<00:00:56.910> we<00:00:57.030> do<00:00:57.210> to<00:00:57.240> this<00:00:57.510> form<00:00:57.870> to<00:00:57.930> sort<00:00:58.260> of

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
what can we do to this form to sort of

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.010 
what can we do to this form to sort of
expand<00:00:58.950> it<00:00:59.100> to<00:00:59.220> make<00:00:59.610> it<00:00:59.790> little<00:01:00.120> linear<00:01:00.660> still

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
expand it to make it little linear still

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.650 
expand it to make it little linear still
use<00:01:01.170> the<00:01:01.380> same<00:01:01.590> notes<00:01:01.950> the<00:01:02.700> are<00:01:02.940> in<00:01:03.150> that<00:01:03.300> scale

use the same notes the are in that scale

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.830 
use the same notes the are in that scale
but<00:01:04.379> to<00:01:04.739> keep<00:01:04.920> it<00:01:05.129> to<00:01:05.670> pull<00:01:06.150> it<00:01:06.270> away<00:01:06.360> from<00:01:06.509> the

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
up higher on the neck you have a little

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.840 
up higher on the neck you have a little
easier<00:01:16.140> way<00:01:16.380> of<00:01:16.619> overreaching<00:01:17.280> some<00:01:17.670> more

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
easier way of overreaching some more

into into licks and riffs or not just

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:29.809 
into into licks and riffs or not just
boxy<00:01:25.109> shape<00:01:27.229> you<00:01:28.229> can<00:01:28.409> expand<00:01:29.130> on<00:01:29.310> that<00:01:29.340> and<00:01:29.670> do

00:01:29.809 --> 00:01:29.819 
boxy shape you can expand on that and do

00:01:29.819 --> 00:01:32.389 
boxy shape you can expand on that and do
some<00:01:30.090> three-note<00:01:30.689> type<00:01:31.079> things<00:01:31.439> and<00:01:31.740> my

favorite two notes if I was going to

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.639 
favorite two notes if I was going to
play<00:01:34.889> in<00:01:35.039> in<00:01:35.609> E<00:01:35.909> minor<00:01:35.939> pentatonic<00:01:36.479> will<00:01:37.289> be<00:01:37.439> to

00:01:37.639 --> 00:01:37.649 
play in in E minor pentatonic will be to

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:44.870 
play in in E minor pentatonic will be to
add<00:01:39.170> this<00:01:40.170> node<00:01:40.499> and<00:01:40.909> this<00:01:41.909> node<00:01:42.049> and<00:01:43.880> going

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
add this node and this node and going

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:50.120 
add this node and this node and going
backwards<00:01:45.450> add<00:01:45.780> this<00:01:46.560> node<00:01:48.770> so<00:01:49.770> you<00:01:49.829> have

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
backwards add this node so you have

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:56.629 
backwards add this node so you have
something<00:01:51.139> goes<00:01:52.139> like<00:01:52.350> this<00:01:55.039> very<00:01:56.039> simple<00:01:56.490> to

00:01:56.629 --> 00:01:56.639 
something goes like this very simple to

00:01:56.639 --> 00:01:59.090 
something goes like this very simple to
memorize<00:01:57.119> it's<00:01:57.600> just<00:01:57.810> basically<00:01:58.200> the<00:01:58.859> same

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
memorize it's just basically the same

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.309 
memorize it's just basically the same
little<00:01:59.429> shapes<00:01:59.759> so<00:02:00.389> check<00:02:00.630> out<00:02:00.840> that<00:02:01.170> the

00:02:01.309 --> 00:02:01.319 
little shapes so check out that the

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:03.679 
little shapes so check out that the
first<00:02:01.560> example<00:02:02.069> I<00:02:02.189> have<00:02:02.219> that<00:02:02.939> is<00:02:03.119> based<00:02:03.389> off

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
first example I have that is based off

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:17.559 
first example I have that is based off
of<00:02:04.340> this<00:02:05.340> kite<00:02:05.939> type<00:02:06.209> of<00:02:06.359> note<00:02:06.539> pattern

00:02:17.559 --> 00:02:17.569 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:20.949

stretch and then it's just basic pant
annex<00:02:46.830> scale<00:02:47.250> but<00:02:47.670> keep<00:02:48.000> in<00:02:48.150> mind<00:02:48.180> that<00:02:48.450> I'm

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
annex scale but keep in mind that I'm

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:53.570 
annex scale but keep in mind that I'm
starting<00:02:49.110> with<00:02:49.260> my<00:02:49.440> third<00:02:50.340> finger<00:02:50.700> here<00:02:52.400> and<00:02:53.400> I

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
starting with my third finger here and I

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:55.100 
starting with my third finger here and I
the<00:02:53.640> reason<00:02:53.910> I<00:02:54.120> do<00:02:54.180> that<00:02:54.330> is<00:02:54.510> because<00:02:54.720> allows

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
the reason I do that is because allows

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:57.800 
the reason I do that is because allows
me<00:02:55.350> to<00:02:56.130> keep<00:02:56.310> it<00:02:56.400> sort<00:02:56.670> of<00:02:56.700> in<00:02:56.850> position<00:02:57.420> and<00:02:57.600> go

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
me to keep it sort of in position and go

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:06.890 
me to keep it sort of in position and go
back<00:02:57.989> to<00:02:58.140> the<00:02:58.260> pinkie<00:02:58.650> again

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:11.630 

so<00:03:07.900> the<00:03:08.650> next<00:03:08.860> lick<00:03:09.130> will<00:03:09.310> will<00:03:09.580> have<00:03:09.790> a<00:03:09.819> quick

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
so the next lick will will have a quick

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.240 
so the next lick will will have a quick
descending<00:03:12.640> pattern<00:03:13.530> would<00:03:14.530> it<00:03:14.680> would<00:03:14.800> a<00:03:14.860> six

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250 
descending pattern would it would a six

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:23.630 
descending pattern would it would a six
notes<00:03:15.489> per<00:03:15.760> beat<00:03:21.900> all<00:03:22.900> notes<00:03:23.260> on<00:03:23.410> our

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640 
notes per beat all notes on our

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.370 
notes per beat all notes on our
alternate<00:03:24.640> pick<00:03:24.970> so<00:03:25.750> let's<00:03:25.959> see<00:03:26.080> how<00:03:26.200> this

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:26.380 
alternate pick so let's see how this

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:38.339 
alternate pick so let's see how this
sounds<00:03:26.590> up-tempo<00:03:36.450> so<00:03:37.450> I<00:03:37.510> basically<00:03:37.690> took<00:03:38.170> the

00:03:38.339 --> 00:03:38.349 
sounds up-tempo so I basically took the

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:41.130 
sounds up-tempo so I basically took the
first<00:03:38.650> idea<00:03:39.430> and<00:03:40.000> I<00:03:40.090> wrapped<00:03:40.360> it<00:03:40.540> up<00:03:40.690> in<00:03:40.900> a

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:41.140 
first idea and I wrapped it up in a

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:43.350 
first idea and I wrapped it up in a
descending<00:03:41.680> lick<00:03:42.250> that<00:03:42.550> that<00:03:42.760> goes<00:03:42.910> in<00:03:43.060> the

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:43.360 
descending lick that that goes in the

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:45.990 
descending lick that that goes in the
groups<00:03:43.720> of<00:03:43.900> six<00:03:44.230> to<00:03:44.560> make<00:03:44.739> it<00:03:44.920> one<00:03:45.190> little

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:46.000 
groups of six to make it one little

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.590 
groups of six to make it one little
piece<00:03:46.769> so<00:03:47.769> here's<00:03:48.040> a<00:03:48.100> descending<00:03:48.730> part<00:03:49.000> in<00:03:49.150> six

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:49.600 
piece so here's a descending part in six

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:59.850 
piece so here's a descending part in six
slow<00:03:57.600> and<00:03:58.600> when<00:03:58.720> you<00:03:58.810> put<00:03:59.019> them<00:03:59.110> together<00:03:59.260> slow

00:03:59.850 --> 00:03:59.860 
slow and when you put them together slow

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:01.170 
slow and when you put them together slow
you'll<00:04:00.100> have<00:04:00.250> something<00:04:00.519> that<00:04:00.790> sounds<00:04:01.030> like

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:01.180 
you'll have something that sounds like

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:16.020 
you'll have something that sounds like
this

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:16.030 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:18.090
