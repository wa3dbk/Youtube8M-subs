00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:06.720
 hello good all here cotorro keys 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:09.330
 commenting once again another week to 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.519
 Spanish practical guides as always 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.440
 a batch of over 100 low background 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.990
 because the series is called minimum of 100 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.600
 for something so good last week 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.550
 I ask you to tell me ideas about what 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.560
 you want to listen and things that you wanted 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.199
 I told you because I have many things 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.240
 tucked in the head but hey look at the 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.939
 comments section yesterday and before 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:32.369
 yesterday and you did not see many ideas the truth 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.410
 I do not know if you are not curious or if 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.420
 you know everything or if you just want 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.399
 entertain you want to watch a game of 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.649
 more than 100 casualties there maybe out there 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.600
 even some as I do many times 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.460
 that silenced me and right now is not 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.379
 listening and playing background music that is 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.910
 something that has had it many times 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.160
 because I am more to enjoy the 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.559
 gameplays wants to see the games and the 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.510
 comment at once because I do not know 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.190
 you but I'm not a woman I can not 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.800
 do two things at a time many times 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.079
 so I can not lend 100% of 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.359
 pay attention to the fact that it is what you see 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.640
 the game and another 100% also at 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:08.330
 comment and it's more or less than what 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:11.210
 I'm going to talk today about paying attention 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:13.970
 and take things more calmly think 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:15.320
 because a very funny comment good 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:17.720
 funny but it caught my attention 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:19.760
 one of you right now I do not remember 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:22.250
 the name so I'm sorry for not 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:24.380
 remember me your name but he told me hey 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:26.600
 frame knows that during all the 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:29.120
 departure they kill you three or four times 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.580
 one of dogs to a cloud sad because no 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:33.920
 combine a little more Russian with a 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:36.350
 little bit more head with cold mind 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.330
 as I often say with me 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:40.610
 that I know more style played tactical that is 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:43.370
 as it is called now and I hope that violate 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:45.440
 in this game commented on whether to die or 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:46.970
 do not die that is better to make yourself 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:49.820
 good games to make you wash days 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:52.250
 of more than 100 casualties it is clear that 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:53.750
 two versions can give you of the two 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:56.000
 versions that are commented two can give 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:58.400
 each your opinion on YouTube 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.380
 I gave you one thing I can tell you another I can 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:02.420
 say more or less what I think of both 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.940
 and then tell you the one that I really think 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:06.710
 which is better to enjoy not for 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:09.380
 take the games that more than 100 casualties 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:11.660
 not to get good games but to 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:13.790
 enjoy and to improve in the call of 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.140
 duty because, as already mentioned in 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.930
 other ocasions 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.250
 you can not learn if you are people here 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.290
 if you are pros what are you seeing now 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:23.660
 same this video and 6 good games 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.580
 constantly because he could make us a 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.319
 comment for you but I want 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:29.000
 also focus a little more for 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:30.830
 those people who have those 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.690
 Spanish tactics to listen 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:35.000
 tips on how to improve the call of 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:38.180
 duty that I think I think I'm the most 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.490
 from you so he wants to die is good 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:43.400
 because if one dies and the camera of 

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:45.170
 death sees as current rival see what they do 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.720
 the other people is much easier 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:50.300
 learn in that way that campeando that 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:52.160
 when tactical that trying not to die 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:55.010
 it's much better 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:57.019
 choose by the map to surround it go by the 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:59.510
 half go everywhere try to try 

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:01.370
 weapons try fruits try everything there 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:03.560
 to try everything because if you do not 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:06.290
 that is impossible to learn is impossible 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:08.959
 improve in the call of duty and the other 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:11.209
 version would be worth I can make myself a 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:12.769
 good game without dying that is true 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:15.290
 there are many things that are made 

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:16.220
 without dying but thinking that it is more 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:18.500
 funny 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:20.319
 be running around the map risk you 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.209
 how do I always or how do I do 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:24.249
 always better risk yourself 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:26.109
 constantly and have one kissed on the 

00:03:24.249 --> 00:03:28.629
 air go for the enemies because they do not 

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:31.120
 you know that you are going to die yes but and if not 

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:33.010
 you die and if you do not die that happens the cli 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:35.889
 pazo that you make the departure that you 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:37.180
 you do what's good you can not do it 

00:03:35.889 --> 00:03:39.250
 good how good you can feel 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:41.139
 because he does not what can be but what 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:44.349
 good that you can feel at that moment 

00:03:41.139 --> 00:03:46.959
 that instead of booking you play with more 

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:49.540
 head out again your dogs another 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:51.459
 time your swarm because that's way more 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:53.919
 easy you make a good game it's true 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:55.780
 because especially in this call of duty 

00:03:53.919 --> 00:03:58.030
 that can be good I think in the mode 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:59.769
 Fer 3 could also be right now 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:01.569
 I remember very well but in this call of 

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:03.459
 duty especially because everything gives you points 

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:06.250
 everything gives you points for the next 

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:08.829
 Streak everything accumulates and it is very very easy 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:11.139
 make an awesome game without 

00:04:08.829 --> 00:04:13.659
 dying is very easy, not always 

00:04:11.139 --> 00:04:16.720
 but hunger things go alone 

00:04:13.659 --> 00:04:18.549
 things you choose practically you do not have to 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:21.940
 do you nothing every time you take the 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:24.520
 first swarm dogs and blackbird 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:26.590
 you do not have to do anything 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:28.870
 is what I wanted to say today if you want 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:31.509
 learn to play if you want to be better 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:33.460
 players I think it's mandatory 

00:04:31.509 --> 00:04:36.310
 die compulsory see how to act the 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:38.919
 enemies required to try 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:41.289
 try doing a thousand and one things and about 

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:43.539
 all dying to risk you I think that's what 

00:04:41.289 --> 00:04:45.159
 better and that's what I try to do in my 

00:04:43.539 --> 00:04:48.340
 channel what I try to bring also in 

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:52.060
 these that my comments is motivating them 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:53.949
 and incite you to russia and russia as 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:56.229
 we have said other times is to run and not 

00:04:53.949 --> 00:04:58.599
 to start the game take control 

00:04:56.229 --> 00:05:00.849
 take the r3 if I'm not wrong and give it 

00:04:58.599 --> 00:05:02.409
 forwards and not for never I believe 

00:05:00.849 --> 00:05:04.360
 which is much more entertaining to play like this 

00:05:02.409 --> 00:05:07.210
 many of you have told me 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:08.710
 I want to break the standards as I have 

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:10.330
 said on other occasions that there is in the 

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:12.819
 Spanish community that exists in all 

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:16.419
 communities that a game of 200 to 

00:05:12.819 --> 00:05:19.030
 0 is much better than a 220 game 

00:05:16.419 --> 00:05:20.770
 to put him not for my taste is much better 

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:22.990
 watch a game where you die 

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:25.000
 where do you participate in the team where 

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:27.639
 you are in constant motion as I have 

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:30.039
 said and other infinite occasions and 

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:31.150
 keep repeating because it's a topic that 

00:05:30.039 --> 00:05:33.370
 I like a theme 

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:35.470
 I want to motivate people a topic 

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:37.510
 that I will try to spread by all 

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:39.430
 sides in the future wherever where 

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:41.560
 whether you go any video of me always 

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:43.810
 I throw some puyita always tell you 

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:45.910
 do this do the other thing because I try 

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:47.620
 motivate you and people respond to people 

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:49.870
 people love it I'm not going to lie to you 

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:52.450
 people love game minister 

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:54.370
 it's not that I'm better or worse but it's 

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:57.100
 which is much more enjoyable when it is 

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:58.810
 enjoy much more watching a video like that and 

00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:01.390
 despite the fact that many times the 

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:02.860
 temptation to reserve to take our 

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:04.420
 puppies take out our hunger 

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:06.580
 our helicopters and make a 

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:09.130
 complete massacre it is true that between the 

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:11.140
 temptation but it's much better much more 

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:14.020
 fun and all my mounts what 

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:16.030
 they show that it is a thousand times better and more 

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:18.010
 fun and you learn much more than 

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:20.350
 that you are interested many of 

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:23.320
 you will learn much more running 

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:25.510
 killing and dying so going back to 

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:29.310
 the main question how are they made 

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:32.310
 best games dying or without dying 

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:34.890
 1 you can never die and you can do 

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:37.350
 a great game is true second 

00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:39.150
 You can die for a long time 

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:41.100
 during many games in a row 

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:43.860
 many times in a row learn and do 

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:46.170
 good games other times from time to time 

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:47.910
 for having to say it some way and be 

00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:50.700
 less consistent in terms of those of 

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:52.530
 get you awesome games but you 

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:54.390
 you are going to have fun, you are going to learn 

00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:56.850
 much more I have become a 

00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:59.190
 much more experienced player a lot 

00:06:56.850 --> 00:07:01.290
 better over the years and everything has 

00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:02.130
 been thanks to that I learned the 

00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:04.020
 response 

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:06.210
 here I have learned how to see myself 

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:09.570
 I learned to die learned to do 

00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:10.350
 50 thousand things and all thanks to learn 

00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:12.840
 of my mistakes 

00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:15.330
 learn dying is what I said 

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:16.890
 many times so well I do not know 

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:18.870
 exactly the game that I'm going to 

00:07:16.890 --> 00:07:20.340
 put of bottom surely is of the 

00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:22.650
 that I have there saved from doing a thousand 

00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:25.050
 December of November matches 

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:27.120
 of more than 100 casualties with submachine gun dogs 

00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:29.100
 swarm what to be giving not to be 

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:31.260
 no but cloud sad and this kind of gusts 

00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:33.810
 that you have seen many times but 

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:36.510
 I hope you have served the comment 

00:07:33.810 --> 00:07:38.430
 leave me and keep putting comments in 

00:07:36.510 --> 00:07:41.100
 plan frames we want to hear this 

00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:42.690
 we want to hear the other because I have 

00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:44.400
 many things to say I know that I am not the 

00:07:42.690 --> 00:07:46.290
 better commentator of course not 

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:48.120
 there are and I said and I do not need 

00:07:46.290 --> 00:07:50.400
 do it because I like what I do and 

00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:52.410
 I want to communicate to people what I do 

00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:54.000
 and what I like to do so good 

00:07:52.410 --> 00:07:56.580
 I hope this week has been 

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:58.200
 enough that I did not get too involved 

00:07:56.580 --> 00:08:00.600
 talking about what you have to talk about 

00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:02.190
 because those other things other of my 

00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:04.860
 defects that I have to improve yet 

00:08:02.190 --> 00:08:06.570
