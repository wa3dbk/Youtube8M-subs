00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:08.590 
start mixing straightaway low speed and

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:10.280 
start mixing straightaway low speed and
speed<00:01:08.979> up<00:01:09.189> to<00:01:09.399> a<00:01:09.429> movie

we're<00:02:31.420> going<00:02:31.450> to<00:02:31.660> go<00:02:31.930> over<00:02:32.080> to<00:02:32.200> the<00:02:32.290> hob<00:02:32.530> so

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860 
we're going to go over to the hob so

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:34.860 
we're going to go over to the hob so
follow<00:02:33.250> me<00:02:33.460> I've<00:02:34.180> got<00:02:34.330> a<00:02:34.360> little<00:02:34.570> saucepan

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
follow me I've got a little saucepan

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:38.210 
follow me I've got a little saucepan
here<00:02:35.380> and<00:02:35.620> I've<00:02:36.310> got<00:02:36.520> 1<00:02:36.940> cup<00:02:37.360> of<00:02:37.630> castor<00:02:38.170> sugar

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
here and I've got 1 cup of castor sugar

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.040 
here and I've got 1 cup of castor sugar
and<00:02:39.220> then<00:02:39.580> a<00:02:39.610> quarter<00:02:40.150> of<00:02:40.210> a<00:02:40.270> cup<00:02:40.450> of<00:02:40.630> water

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.050 
and then a quarter of a cup of water

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:44.270 
and then a quarter of a cup of water
don't<00:02:41.650> stir<00:02:42.190> it<00:02:42.220> because<00:02:42.930> that<00:02:43.930> can

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
don't stir it because that can

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:48.180 
don't stir it because that can
contribute<00:02:45.280> to<00:02:45.810> crystallizing<00:02:46.810> in<00:02:46.990> the<00:02:47.890> sugar

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
contribute to crystallizing in the sugar

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:49.470 
contribute to crystallizing in the sugar
so<00:02:48.310> just<00:02:48.490> give<00:02:48.580> it<00:02:48.640> a<00:02:48.700> little<00:02:48.790> shuffle<00:02:49.210> around

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
so just give it a little shuffle around

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.750 
so just give it a little shuffle around
just<00:02:49.750> to<00:02:49.810> kind<00:02:49.960> of<00:02:50.020> settle<00:02:50.290> it<00:02:50.440> down<00:02:50.650> and<00:02:50.950> then

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
just to kind of settle it down and then

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.660 
just to kind of settle it down and then
pop<00:02:52.180> the<00:02:52.360> heat<00:02:52.570> on<00:02:52.780> to<00:02:53.410> let<00:02:53.740> it<00:02:53.860> heat<00:02:54.040> up<00:02:54.220> let<00:02:54.640> it

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
pop the heat on to let it heat up let it

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:57.240 
pop the heat on to let it heat up let it
come<00:02:54.880> to<00:02:54.910> the<00:02:55.090> boil<00:02:55.300> it'll<00:02:55.780> get<00:02:56.140> to<00:02:56.350> be<00:02:56.560> a<00:02:56.830> sort

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
come to the boil it'll get to be a sort

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:59.550 
come to the boil it'll get to be a sort
of<00:02:57.310> light<00:02:57.730> amber<00:02:58.300> color<00:02:58.540> and<00:02:58.660> that's<00:02:59.170> when<00:02:59.440> we
