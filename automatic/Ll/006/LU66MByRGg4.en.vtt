00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:05.400
 and 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.700
 Hi I hope you're fine 

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:22.350
 head of the ex dablé to serve you 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:23.590
 today do not recipes that comes 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.380
 from England 

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:27.610
 we will revisit the fish and chips good 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:31.690
 I already did it I took some advanced 

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:33.580
 of yam so I cut a little bit like 

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:36.640
 apples for new as fries that 

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:37.900
 it's tropical soul that's 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:39.820
 I cut the same size as the 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:42.760
 boats look a bit like a little bit 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:45.129
 like french fries so the flour and 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:48.550
 crumbs for breakdown and a small round 

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:49.059
 green shallots eggs oil 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:50.920
 olive 

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:52.540
 we go it's a little mayonnaise next 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:54.790
 and then that's fine for the 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:57.460
 recipe we will start with the 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:01:00.640
 mayonnaise that will accompany the fish 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:03.809
 and chips so mayonnaise is what these 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:08.490
 egg yolk mustard a little oil 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:10.960
 a lot of oil itself is an emulsion 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.430
 so the white I put it in the end in 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:15.060
 my preparation that will serve me panex 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:18.420
 do not need me i just keep yellow 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.200
 for mayonnaise a little bit of salt 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:26.039
 put a little shallot 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:26.039
 from the outset the mustard 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:31.929
 I mix everything wise and incorporates we're going 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:36.909
 mount the preparation of the blow to him from 

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:38.799
 these principles of mayonnaise a net 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:41.679
 of olive oil stirred the goal it's 

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:42.869
 to create the emulsion what so there is 

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:45.700
 a lot of bubbles in the mayonnaise 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.740
 as you can see there 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.539
 begins to thicken 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.920
 it's good but we're good we're going there 

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:53.140
 incorporated a little bit of hot pepper 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.490
 to raise all that so we're going to 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.959
 really just take a little bit 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:57.819
 it's the whole movie that's very, very 

00:01:55.959 --> 00:01:59.259
 very hard we're just a little bit 

00:01:57.819 --> 00:02:01.090
 raise a little bit the source close to 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:02.200
 but on paper towels while not 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:03.459
 that they are in contact with the board 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.649
 because it stays that can stay and 

00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:09.250
 then after that pushes taste of this 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:10.239
 that you can cut after so that's 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.849
 really a sauce that will accompany 

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:16.450
 fish and chips and there now she is 

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:21.790
 good we put it in the fridge we're a little 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:24.579
 little lemon I like it here we go 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:27.640
 leave on now the only the sole 

00:02:24.579 --> 00:02:30.099
 we are going to the breakdown and to English alan 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:34.239
 So flour flour breadcrumbs 

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:35.650
 laouzas and eggs we see crazy 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:39.239
 were connected by a bit like we 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:39.239
 did our salt 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:46.870
 pepper and this spice that I love 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:48.940
 it's shrimp powder leg 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:54.700
 but still in it's going to be free and that 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:56.350
 will fix the impeccable flavors I put 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:03:00.340
 a little weight in the flour little bit 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:04.870
 salt we are not going to the sole so we 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:10.890
 so start flour first we tap 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:10.890
 to remove the excess flour the egg 

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:16.440
 and schappler 

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:23.280
 we press a little bit on it we press 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.430
 for that final crumbs cling 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:27.860
 well in the end 1 to the food so that's 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:31.739
 the principle of breaded fish 1 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:33.720
 in fact simply is rather than 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:36.450
 hadj is rather than buying a fish 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:38.190
 breaded in supermarket that does not have to 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:39.650
 taste we select other fish 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:44.069
 choose the pace of ourselves 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:45.420
 the fish is not born is good we have 

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:46.250
 the french fries we're going to spend all this at the 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:49.709
 deep fryer directly 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:52.880
 so little pan we will start 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:52.880
 by yam fries 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:02.420
 we will let fry roughly between 2 

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:05.420
 and 3 minutes and right after we will offer 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:07.819
 small fish sticks for the 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:09.440
 Breaded fish you have the sea ​​bream you 

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:11.569
 have redfish you have useful to 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:13.310
 foot with which one can do that all 

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:15.769
 the white fish that you can 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:17.660
 find the easiest in the end for them 

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:18.709
 cut to have pretty sticks 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:19.970
 like that you put them at 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:23.720
 freezer once they are well 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:25.070
 sure if you cut them out hard and wanted 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:29.919
 not directly will be easier 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:29.919
 in the end keep nice fries 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:38.750
 impeccable we will put a little bit of 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:45.229
 salt and there we go directly 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:47.410
 behind with the fish that you are pretty 

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:47.410
 quick 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:53.060
 look there the fish is starting to cook 

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:54.770
 pure purchase and you still pretty bruno 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:56.750
 continue and as soon as we come out of the fire 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:58.010
 directly once it's gone we 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:59.840
 salt balance to crystallize 

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:02.979
 in the end on the preparation 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:02.979
 we are at the top 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:10.660
 the fish is cooked I got the 

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:12.289
 mayonnaise that I had chilled 

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:13.039
 it's the little pieces of paper 

00:05:12.289 --> 00:05:14.840
 greaseproof 

00:05:13.039 --> 00:05:18.400
 I'm not cooking in the end 

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:18.400
 that I took to decorate 

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:32.220
 here are two small fries inside 

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:35.520

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:36.830
 little jersey six bridges it's cool 

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:39.419
 it's original 

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:42.090

00:05:39.419 --> 00:05:44.340

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:46.919
