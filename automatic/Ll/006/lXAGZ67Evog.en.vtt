00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.149
 Ruud Bread Sportsmen on the 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:04.080
 background he is within the first 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:07.109
 period 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:09.500
 yes yes that indicates 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:11.880
 also samoa and want that too 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:14.309
 pursue our goal 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.960
 first period within so that price 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.910
 Get that gives this right 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.350
 for the playoffs to play for 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.550
 promotion and of course we want there 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.869
 more 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.189
 but it also indicates that we are with 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.710
 its all you talk about total 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:28.920
 organization with your supporters that too 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.929
 being able to celebrate happily with each other 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.099
 yes that indicates I think with 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.469
 all pretty 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.690
 have started on the right track 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:39.960
 On the other hand, see 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.040
 yes we still need to improve matters 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.329
 because that is the next question 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.250
 of course you have to stay critical 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:47.280
 because good today was by no means no 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.079
 I thought we didn't defend it 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.660
 had good standing 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:54.059
 first half without your field road 8 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.800
 March pitch one we should do that better 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.750
 picking up 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:00.480
 make your own world goal again whose 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.640
 on the dali 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.670
 but second half valuable the idea of 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.960
 that they need even more so you saw 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.240
 have also changed 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.560
 it was just the space over the sides 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.000
 We also had thrust for in 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.189
 and hence have christian the 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.659
 Tom brought a lady ring 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.729
 yes , of course, he left a small yellow card 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.890
 We didn't want to touch that 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.869
 to play with ten people and then 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.549
 make your 2 0 or fairly fast and yes we 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.950
 have to learn to be ruthless 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:28.229
 by hunting or killer 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.390
 that third what is nicer ruud it 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.860
 tackle from that period or looking at 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.770
 it further the how that roda today 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:37.560
 points left at home against young PSV 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:40.799
 yes at the at the we think we we 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:44.100
 now have a yes no competition 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:45.840
 I think at the it again we indicate 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.759
 are quite on track on the performance which 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.200
 it is about being within it is not 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:51.119
 easy to get back to a previous week 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.130
 jewelry pushed away 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:54.390
 but we must always do this well then 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.210
 is therefore nice to know that 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:59.250
 competitor and let you down 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.719
 and grab at this period title 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:04.100
 hopefully that will give something 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:05.579
 trust and yes let's continue this 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.869
 Congratulations it will be one 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:08.369
 later 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.810
 yes you have to do i said it too 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.670
 it is also a price you must do it too 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.290
 can celebrate 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:16.349
 Do not count as china head 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:18.870
 and we want something with all of them 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:20.190
 in the background working with cell heart 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.420
 yes it is nice that i have this title 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.190
 to have 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:25.020
 yes and let's say let 's be the second third 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:28.550
 and fourth nice inside but that is too 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:28.550
 easily said leave with you again 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.420
 Yes
