are taking a look at paired windows

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.740 
are taking a look at paired windows
today<00:00:07.890> and<00:00:08.250> as<00:00:08.880> you<00:00:09.059> can<00:00:09.179> see<00:00:09.210> here<00:00:09.480> at<00:00:09.599> the<00:00:09.630> top

if I tap on that it'll launch two
windows<00:00:15.509> at<00:00:15.750> the<00:00:15.780> same<00:00:16.080> time<00:00:16.350> which<00:00:16.920> i<00:00:17.130> have

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
windows at the same time which i have

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.400 
windows at the same time which i have
actually<00:00:17.430> set<00:00:17.789> up<00:00:17.820> prior<00:00:18.150> to<00:00:18.180> this<00:00:18.570> video<00:00:18.930> here

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
and you can actually make presets of

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.109 
and you can actually make presets of
different<00:00:21.779> windows<00:00:22.050> you<00:00:22.199> want<00:00:22.380> to<00:00:22.529> launch

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:23.119 
different windows you want to launch

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:25.340
