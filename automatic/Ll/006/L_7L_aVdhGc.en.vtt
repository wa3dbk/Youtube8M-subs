00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.659
 my dear audience outside hello and 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.670
 Welcome to a new video 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:07.109
 to gta 5 on the pc in the comments 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.599
 I was allowed to read that often now 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:11.759
 This game is not supposed to be in the model 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.590
 so be that is no mods will give 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:14.969
 like gta 5 on the PC and it will 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.680
 More it will be high time for me 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.990
 a first modification to this game 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.439
 So imagine off when you go 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.439
 after boarding 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:29.690
 well so far so I have to the people 

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:32.150
 give right in this video here 

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:34.160
 I still do not like you as one 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:35.660
 stop in a ufo by los santos 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.309
 can fly as far actually 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:38.720
 not yet what the fashion is concerned but if 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:40.160
 he sees this, then you will 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:42.530
 realize that something looks different 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.030
 And that's also a modification too 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:45.980
 but I have to anticipate this game 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:47.210
 if you somehow moth 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:48.320
 I should be even more like that now 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:49.550
 if you somehow make tomorrow's videos 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:50.930
 should then that's always at your own 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:52.370
 danger if somehow the 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:54.110
 computer breaks because something 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:55.519
 does it wrong or if its ok 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:56.629
 banned online because you can do it 

00:00:55.519 --> 00:00:58.579
 used online then that's all 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:00:59.840
 own risk in providing the warning 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:00.980
 Of course I want to give it out anyway 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.540
 I will gladly give you a few 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:03.860
 show and explain modifications 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:06.229
 how to get the installed today is about 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:06.950
 the four top youth modification too 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:09.229
 this game 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:10.399
 and yes what is that the field of view that 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:11.780
 know most of you out 

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:14.030
 minecraft is synonymous always very much 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.890
 a high so the field of view so that one 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.630
 then for example at hot goods games or something 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.280
 can see as much as possible and just that 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:21.470
 recognize opponents as early as possible 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.330
 So that's just how it works 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:24.560
 far left and right or how big 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:26.780
 the area i see on the screen 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.700
 see and i have here now in relative 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.569
 large area times adjusted to one 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.380
 directly sees that there is something 

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:32.420
 have changed 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:34.160
 the whole thing looks very stretched out 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:36.050
 For example, if I'm in the 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:37.819
 normal view would be seasonal 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:38.780
 car now usually in the game 

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:41.179
 and if I have an ego perspective now 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.800
 suddenly change is much further 

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:43.970
 felt away or so you can see it too 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:46.580
 if I had to go in the normal way 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:48.020
 view and so you just see if 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:49.550
 I go much further and everything is one 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:51.170
 a little stretched that is just one 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:52.670
 modification with this one 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:54.560
 eyeshot further it can change 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.750
 by default there is already one 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:58.420
 slider in the settings under camera 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.560
 Here you can see the ego-perspective 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.300
 or the field of vision for the 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.860
 ego perspective when walking 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:05.119
 on the move is set that is yes 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.459
 just what we are doing right now 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:08.780
 walking around in the ego perspective 

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:10.160
 and some people are still there 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.900
 not enough if you also max in the 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.190
 month this slider and there are 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:15.319
 this modification with the one the 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.709
 just set the field of view even larger 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:17.900
 can 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:19.760
 that's what it looks like 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.290
 you have to look that you stand on it 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.730
 As I said everyone online would be me 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.480
 Be careful not to do that 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.040
 will somehow yes regarded as 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.140
 would give it an advantage because 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.629
 you see the opponents earlier and then 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.620
 One is warned or so for it 

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:33.750
 Of course I do not take any guarantee on 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.580
 saturday with his clear but otherwise 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.989
 There is already the first motivation like 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:39.500
 said and with the cologne view falls 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:39.500
 still expanding 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:11.090
 and we can install it all 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:14.560
 I say now we come to that 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:17.720
 second part as installed the vbz 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:19.370
 on your pc for gta first important 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:21.050
 thing is before you do anything 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:23.500
 look for the first time your gta 5 

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:25.549
 Installation folder is the 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.440
 by default if that has over steam 

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:28.459
 in the steam installation assign otherwise 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:30.140
 Have to see where you play this game 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:31.250
 nobody has installed this is a 60 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:32.959
 gigabyte order so the values ​​fell 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:35.030
 can not overlook the near future 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:38.390
 whole at least in my games and 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:41.599
 programs disk under games and 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:42.860
 team and if he does that now if so too 

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:45.170
 then steam over then you will find that 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:47.060
 at steam under steam apps then 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:51.349
 to be accommodated that is the highest with me 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:53.420
 and then he's just looking for that there 

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:56.360
 folder and this folder has one 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:59.090
 size of 60 6 gigabytes with me the 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:01.280
 Please make it before he copies it as 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:03.140
 For the first time and make me one 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:04.760
 Security copy of the folder either 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:05.989
 on the same hard disk or on one 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:07.489
 other hard disk or power and 

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:08.780
 Backup of that if 

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:10.250
 something does not go wrong you that 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:11.989
 19 years you have to play the whole game 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:14.269
 saved folders so before you 

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:15.650
 changed something motto I said 

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:16.669
 would copy the game again and 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:18.049
 always decided differently pattern 

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:19.760
 Of course not, but then it can be 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:21.410
 if something goes wrong that he is playing 

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:23.539
 lose is then you have to 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:25.190
 the file the folder in the video 

00:04:23.539 --> 00:04:27.260
 constituents there is a doping to the 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:28.789
 motto you download and then down 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:30.940
 Do you have one packaged here? 

00:04:28.789 --> 00:04:32.800
 file is the 55 you 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:34.450
 and they had them and in them you find 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:37.810
 now several files for example here 

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:38.950
 this one performance party she finds 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:41.410
 once here in the readme file 

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:42.580
 there is what you should do in there but 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:44.020
 I tell you so now 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:45.490
 just when you can visualize it again 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:47.050
 c ++ install 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:48.430
 this version is not on the pc from 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:50.020
 For safety's sake, this time will run 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:51.580
 and the whole install so that the 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:54.040
 whole runs then you just take here 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:57.010
 the sound punctually or maybe 

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:59.290
 is also called this and the fv 

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:01.540
 file and simply copy both files 

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:03.100
 folder in your gta 5 games 

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:04.750
 public now just that is the 

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:05.950
 gta 5 player folder that if you if 

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:07.600
 you do not know the right man 

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:09.790
 have found that is where to 

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:12.760
 example the gta 5 file in it is where to 

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:15.520
 example things are in there as well 

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:17.020
 the bank 2 b 64 and such then say 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:18.340
 since the right folder those 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:19.270
 Of course, best secured before 

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:21.070
 have said as 

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:22.450
 and in this folder cd is just 

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:23.800
 these two parties are the others 

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:26.890
 then you do not need them both 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:28.210
 first install the vcr is x64 us 

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:30.040
 talking here is just standing there again 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:32.140
 what you should do and the idea 

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:35.740
 sound and the fwv the deficit needs yes 

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:36.880
 just in your gardening needs 

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:38.680
 not in any of the subfolders 

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:40.390
 just here in the main folder purely 

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:42.610
 and there you have the two now 

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:44.710
 files in it and if you now yours for 

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:46.930
 want to stop review for the game there 

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:48.250
 goes the wheels of the s in the game are the 

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:49.750
 does not work anymore but 

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:51.640
 you can only do a lot of fouls over 

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:53.440
 This advise is a complete 

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:53.980
 normal text file opened here and 

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:56.580
 here is for example now 

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:58.900
 set to 68 by default 

00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:00.760
 By default, the numbers are here as 

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:02.620
 if you have the standard range 

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:05.020
 want where there is normally play 

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:08.230
 then those are the numbers between 45 to 

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:10.210
 55 that means 68 already for example 

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:12.250
 neat about what is actually in the 

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:15.190
 game is still important is the number of 

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:18.250
 here is one vertical 

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:19.480
 Field of vision that is if you are so 

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:22.030
 a bit difficult to explain though 

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:23.430
 say 68 is standard 

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:25.870
 set and that corresponds to one 

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:26.950
 horizontal field of view of 100 degrees 

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:29.530
 so that's a decent one 

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:31.150
 number 68 is already clearly above what 

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:32.170
 strong victory is 55 but you can 

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:33.370
 Of course, you play around a bit 

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:34.480
 can make the number to 100 times 

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:36.520
 very extreme in itself 

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:37.900
 but 68 is just normal size that can 

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:39.130
 I recommend and otherwise also one 

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:40.450
 a little bit more needed was the numbers 

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:41.980
 a little bit higher 

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:44.080
 yes and when could the game be quite normal ? 

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:45.610
 start and play and if you're in 

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:46.960
 the ego perspective is what you have 

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:48.700
 just the broad view will be what he just 

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:50.080
 have clearly seen the motivation 

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:52.000
 is nothing special but some people 

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:53.530
 So many can use that 

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.670
 people is the normal field of vision meego 

00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:56.470
 perspective might not be enough 

00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:57.940
 and with this mod you can do that 

00:06:56.470 --> 00:06:59.170
 so modify it is a first 

00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:00.820
 modification to gta 5 

00:06:59.170 --> 00:07:02.200
 and I think that will be more 

00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:03.910
 I already have another video in 

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:05.560
 planning stays in that respect I will 

00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:06.850
 you continue to introduce mods have fun 

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:08.320
 so if he has questions Switzerland 

00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:10.180
 as well as comments I'm out for now 

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:13.830
 until the next presentation to gta 5 

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:13.830
 on the pc ware file 

00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:26.650
 but he would have run at last 

00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:26.650
 contract from the mantek
