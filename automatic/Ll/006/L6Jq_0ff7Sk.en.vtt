00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.280
 we are watching a series of video lessons on 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.729
 the work of the Yukos system 

00:00:10.729 --> 00:00:13.729
 overview of the control panel yuko site 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.890
 control panel of your site 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.980
 compare ap palace with a study 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:20.699
 developers 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.539
 let's see what it is 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:26.439
 Well, first of all, I'm a horizontal member 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:28.749
 menu bar 

00:00:28.749 --> 00:00:31.789
 Gleb its parts are located 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:33.129
 items to each of which 

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:35.450
 corresponds to 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:37.170
 drop-down menu 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.470
 in general customization design tools 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:41.500
 security settings help 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.500
 and paid services 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.100
 and the second part is the possibility 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.280
 interface color settings and 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:49.820
 interface language 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.170
 exit button from the control tunnel and 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.540
 site occupied indicator 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:56.720
 for example, I will have 342 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:58.310
 megabyte and with 

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:01.310
 1526 and available 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:04.460
 where would the parts of the control panel 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:07.660
 situated 

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:09.650
 remove the list 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:11.930
 as you can see here there will be two folds 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:13.320
 active mods 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.299
 it's dedicated to the day 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.340
 working on our site 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.120
 and not active are those models that you 

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.940
 you can 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:23.680
 connect if necessary 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.240
 Further 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.230
 worth noting that under 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:31.230
 there is a list of modules 

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:34.620
 advertising banners which 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:36.500
 displays kakut 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.720
 new information either about the system or 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:40.290
 supporters 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.290
 you can disable them by the way 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.080
 on the main page control panel by 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:49.960
 the center is located 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.440
 such a small block in which rendered 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.670
 thats most important most often 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.280
 used functions 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:59.790
 from the composition 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.110
 horizontal ministry 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:04.820
 starting from design management 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:07.180
 ending with the file manager backup 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:08.569
 by copying 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:11.019
 project and so on 

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:12.549
 well and on top 

00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:14.849
 a few stanzas with basic information about 

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:15.929
 our website 

00:02:15.929 --> 00:02:19.109
 This date of registration is the website address available. 

00:02:19.109 --> 00:02:19.509
 disk space 

00:02:19.509 --> 00:02:22.509
 information on 

00:02:25.179 --> 00:02:27.469
 paid services 

00:02:27.469 --> 00:02:29.769
 I would say that the control panel 

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:31.849
 logical unit price 

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:34.040
 two pieces of mesh is clothes 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:35.839
 no horizontal 

00:02:35.839 --> 00:02:37.789
 it can be called 

00:02:37.789 --> 00:02:41.139
 but in general settings and in general function 

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:43.539
 and this 

00:02:43.539 --> 00:02:44.769
 wise 

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:46.379
 when clicking on a specific module 

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:49.379
 opens 

00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:52.449
 list and if possible by work 

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:55.189
 handed over starting from setting ending 

00:02:55.189 --> 00:02:58.399
 management category is interesting 

00:02:58.399 --> 00:03:00.709
 thus using the panel 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:02.639
 of management 

00:03:02.639 --> 00:03:04.799
 but works with your site 

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:06.119
 very comfortably 

00:03:06.119 --> 00:03:08.439
 since the location of all the possibilities 

00:03:08.439 --> 00:03:11.269
 the system and its taste is intuitive
