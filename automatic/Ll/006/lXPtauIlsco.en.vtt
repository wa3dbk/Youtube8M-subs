should be let's take a close look at how

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:26.900 
should be let's take a close look at how
to<00:00:20.880> do<00:00:21.119> it

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.920 

first<00:00:27.900> lay<00:00:28.440> the<00:00:28.470> tie<00:00:28.770> down<00:00:29.039> on<00:00:29.250> a<00:00:29.279> table<00:00:29.930> next

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:30.930 
first lay the tie down on a table next

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:33.710 
first lay the tie down on a table next
you<00:00:31.890> need<00:00:32.040> to<00:00:32.189> make<00:00:32.369> a<00:00:32.400> loop<00:00:32.700> with<00:00:33.030> the<00:00:33.510> large

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:33.720 
you need to make a loop with the large

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:38.479 
you need to make a loop with the large
end<00:00:34.020> like<00:00:34.770> this

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.880 

do<00:00:39.270> the<00:00:39.420> same<00:00:39.600> thing<00:00:39.930> with<00:00:40.260> a<00:00:40.290> smaller<00:00:40.620> end

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
do the same thing with a smaller end

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.119 
do the same thing with a smaller end
like<00:00:41.700> this

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.569 

there<00:00:45.129> you<00:00:45.219> go<00:00:45.449> that's<00:00:46.449> right<00:00:47.460> with<00:00:48.460> your

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:51.729 
right hand take the small loop and turn

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:58.000 
right hand take the small loop and turn
it<00:00:51.969> once

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.010 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:01.420

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:07.940 
slip the smaller loop inside the bigger

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:10.670 
slip the smaller loop inside the bigger
one

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:18.640 

like<00:01:11.670> that<00:01:12.950> inside<00:01:13.950> it

and<00:01:24.409> slide<00:01:25.409> it<00:01:25.619> inside<00:01:26.040> the<00:01:26.190> two<00:01:26.400> loops

00:01:29.819 --> 00:01:29.829 

00:01:29.829 --> 00:01:32.679 

take<00:01:30.829> it<00:01:30.979> on<00:01:31.130> the<00:01:31.249> other<00:01:31.340> side<00:01:31.460> and<00:01:31.999> hold<00:01:32.569> the

take it on the other side and hold the

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:36.940 
take it on the other side and hold the
two<00:01:32.869> ends<00:01:33.170> together<00:01:34.149> now<00:01:35.149> pull<00:01:36.109> gently<00:01:36.409> on<00:01:36.710> the

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
two ends together now pull gently on the

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.450 
two ends together now pull gently on the
neck<00:01:37.159> loop<00:01:37.460> with<00:01:38.060> your<00:01:38.179> left<00:01:38.450> hand<00:01:38.659> very
