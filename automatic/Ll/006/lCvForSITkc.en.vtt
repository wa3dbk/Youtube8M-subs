00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:13.210
 I said it looks like a serious situation 

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:13.210
 because it is very good for you 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:23.620
 my greatest enemy 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:26.630
 never 3g to you can you give more workers 

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:29.480
 yes that is to say quite 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:32.650
 if you come as a doctor mentality first 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:32.650
 world here does not work 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:40.160
 is another world the worst thing that can happen to you 

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:42.670
 that a patient dies at the table 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.670
 of spin sos 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.460
 but they ask us 

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:55.450
 every day about 15,000 people 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:57.829
 they enter one of the hospitals of 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:01:02.050
 our country 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:02.050
 but none of them will be alone 

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:09.140
 every moment a doctor a surgeon 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:10.640
 he just phoned his mother-in-law 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.580
 has said that we do it well a 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:17.080
 nurse 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:19.390
 take care of them people in whom 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:22.960
 we hardly know of those who for the first 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:27.170
 Once we will know how they work how they live 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:30.979
 how they think how they feel 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:34.690
 medical body will show you the life of 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:54.870

 Hello 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:16.380
 last year they were trying not to 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.260
 I have already begun to reach the memory 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:21.970
 I remember that warning that was very 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:24.400
 endearing because we arrived and was the 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:26.349
 lady already with her newborn baby in 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.120
 the arms and with her husband next and 

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:30.510
 I was sitting alone for years 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.510
 the portal

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:47.440
 and I said 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.819
 we arrived at the hospital as we are not going to 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:51.519
 get to the hospital we have to get there 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:54.120
 He did not raise his skirt and saw her 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:57.120
 little black head that we gave to cut 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.120
 things 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.750
 look 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:09.660
 in the emotion face of the father was 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:11.580
 between scared and excited you put on 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:13.080
 the skin of the parents of what they have 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:17.360
 had to live in those minutes of 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:17.360
 tension and emotion and you get contagia

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:42.110
 [Music] 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:51.329
 when a person approaches and you 

00:03:47.939 --> 00:03:53.670
 recognize because you have helped him and he gives you 

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:55.110
 thank you excites you a lot is not 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:57.390
 something that usually happens or that we wait 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:58.920
 us but it is true that you give 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:01.879
 realize that you are doing a job that 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.879
