you just got the e before so there's one
over<00:02:30.190> three<00:02:30.640> and<00:02:32.700> then<00:02:33.700> go<00:02:33.940> to<00:02:33.970> us<00:02:34.930> our<00:02:35.880> dir<00:02:36.880> and

then you should see something down here
called<00:02:40.120> eboot<00:02:40.510> which<00:02:41.080> is<00:02:41.380> the<00:02:41.650> old<00:02:41.769> one<00:02:42.040> but

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
called eboot which is the old one but

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:44.100 
called eboot which is the old one but
for<00:02:42.459> me<00:02:42.580> it's<00:02:42.760> then<00:02:42.970> the<00:02:43.360> new<00:02:43.570> one<00:02:43.600> because<00:02:43.930> I

for me it's then the new one because I

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:47.550 
for me it's then the new one because I
already<00:02:44.230> already<00:02:44.709> replaced<00:02:45.190> it<00:02:45.400> and<00:02:46.560> just

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
already already replaced it and just

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
boot on to here and make sure you name

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:56.550 
boot on to here and make sure you name
it<00:02:52.769> exactly<00:02:53.769> this<00:02:54.010> eboot<00:02:54.610> bin<00:02:55.239> make<00:02:56.019> sure<00:02:56.050> you

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
it exactly this eboot bin make sure you

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:59.220 
it exactly this eboot bin make sure you
name<00:02:56.739> it<00:02:56.920> that<00:02:56.950> and<00:02:57.370> then<00:02:58.030> now<00:02:58.690> when<00:02:58.959> you<00:02:59.050> want

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
name it that and then now when you want

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:01.410 
name it that and then now when you want
to<00:02:59.290> real-time<00:02:59.769> editor<00:03:00.340> and<00:03:00.819> you<00:03:01.000> connect<00:03:01.300> an

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
to real-time editor and you connect an

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:04.140 
to real-time editor and you connect an
attached<00:03:01.720> it<00:03:01.989> should<00:03:02.319> work<00:03:02.560> and<00:03:02.890> then<00:03:03.819> the

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.150 
attached it should work and then the

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:05.880 
attached it should work and then the
second<00:03:04.480> reason<00:03:04.569> which<00:03:05.230> is<00:03:05.410> probably<00:03:05.680> because

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:05.890 
second reason which is probably because

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:08.400 
second reason which is probably because
you<00:03:06.160> are<00:03:06.250> not<00:03:06.310> on<00:03:06.730> wired<00:03:07.030> or<00:03:07.420> you<00:03:07.930> didn't<00:03:08.200> set

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:08.410 
you are not on wired or you didn't set

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:10.500 
you are not on wired or you didn't set
it<00:03:08.440> up<00:03:08.620> right<00:03:08.799> or<00:03:09.040> something<00:03:09.430> like<00:03:09.549> that<00:03:09.610> just

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510 
it up right or something like that just

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:12.930 
it up right or something like that just
make<00:03:10.690> sure<00:03:10.720> you're<00:03:11.019> set<00:03:11.260> up<00:03:11.290> right<00:03:11.620> and<00:03:11.940> keep

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:12.940 
make sure you're set up right and keep

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:16.199 
make sure you're set up right and keep
checking<00:03:13.209> it<00:03:13.510> and<00:03:13.720> you<00:03:14.440> should<00:03:14.620> be<00:03:14.650> fine<00:03:15.209> but

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:16.209 
checking it and you should be fine but

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:17.910 
checking it and you should be fine but
it's<00:03:16.480> mainly<00:03:16.720> because<00:03:17.019> people<00:03:17.650> don't<00:03:17.739> have

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:17.920 
it's mainly because people don't have

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:19.830 
it's mainly because people don't have
the<00:03:18.070> right<00:03:18.220> Eve<00:03:18.459> it's<00:03:18.730> as<00:03:18.940> wise<00:03:19.269> doesn't<00:03:19.690> work

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
the right Eve it's as wise doesn't work

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:22.560 
the right Eve it's as wise doesn't work
but<00:03:20.709> um<00:03:20.760> just<00:03:21.760> do<00:03:21.880> what<00:03:22.030> I<00:03:22.060> taught<00:03:22.299> you<00:03:22.329> guys

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:22.570 
but um just do what I taught you guys

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:25.049 
but um just do what I taught you guys
