00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:04.729 
throughout the series for you how much a

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:07.209 
throughout the series for you how much a
shot<00:02:05.240> selection<00:02:05.959> played<00:02:06.289> a<00:02:06.319> factor<00:02:06.679> in<00:02:07.009> that

00:02:07.209 --> 00:02:07.219 
shot selection played a factor in that

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:09.850 
shot selection played a factor in that
well<00:02:08.060> yeah<00:02:08.300> I<00:02:08.330> think<00:02:08.690> you<00:02:09.410> know<00:02:09.500> they<00:02:09.619> did<00:02:09.770> a

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
well yeah I think you know they did a

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:11.530 
well yeah I think you know they did a
good<00:02:09.950> job<00:02:10.009> for<00:02:10.369> us<00:02:10.429> to<00:02:10.700> take<00:02:10.940> difficult<00:02:11.120> shots

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 
good job for us to take difficult shots

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.620 
good job for us to take difficult shots
I<00:02:11.660> think<00:02:11.690> the<00:02:11.900> defensive<00:02:12.410> picked<00:02:12.709> up<00:02:13.630> but

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:14.630 
I think the defensive picked up but

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:16.120 
I think the defensive picked up but
still<00:02:14.780> in<00:02:14.930> all<00:02:15.050> we<00:02:15.200> did<00:02:15.319> a<00:02:15.350> much<00:02:15.530> better<00:02:15.560> job<00:02:15.830> in

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
still in all we did a much better job in

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:17.680 
still in all we did a much better job in

coley Jim Hill KCBS TV was it a matter
of<00:02:31.770> what<00:02:32.070> the<00:02:32.100> Celtics<00:02:32.640> did<00:02:32.790> to<00:02:32.970> you<00:02:33.180> or<00:02:33.420> what

of what the Celtics did to you or what

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.200 
of what the Celtics did to you or what
you<00:02:34.230> did<00:02:34.470> to<00:02:34.500> yourselves<00:02:35.100> that<00:02:35.520> allowed<00:02:36.060> them
