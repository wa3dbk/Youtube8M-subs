00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
system in place so but in a second you

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.869 
system in place so but in a second you

just focus a little bit fee so you can

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.389 
just focus a little bit fee so you can
see<00:00:51.030> you<00:00:51.149> got<00:00:51.270> release<00:00:51.629> and<00:00:51.930> then<00:00:52.050> you<00:00:52.280> lock<00:00:53.280> it

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
see you got release and then you lock it

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.549 
see you got release and then you lock it
in<00:00:53.489> place<00:00:53.610> this<00:00:54.480> has<00:00:54.629> got<00:00:54.780> like<00:00:54.899> two<00:00:55.140> new<00:00:55.320> lock

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
in place this has got like two new lock

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.819 
in place this has got like two new lock
systems<00:00:56.010> in<00:00:56.160> place<00:00:57.230> so<00:00:58.230> once<00:00:58.379> you<00:00:58.500> put<00:00:58.620> it<00:00:58.739> on

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
systems in place so once you put it on

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.260 
systems in place so once you put it on
you<00:00:59.010> just<00:00:59.039> turn<00:00:59.370> upside<00:00:59.670> down<00:00:59.699> and<00:00:59.910> you<00:01:00.120> lock

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
you just turn upside down and you lock

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.270 
you just turn upside down and you lock
into<00:01:00.510> place<00:01:00.600> and<00:01:00.899> it<00:01:00.960> shouldn't<00:01:01.199> move<00:01:01.320> so<00:01:02.129> I'm

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
into place and it shouldn't move so I'm

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.130 
into place and it shouldn't move so I'm
going<00:01:02.430> to<00:01:02.489> try<00:01:02.609> that<00:01:02.760> right<00:01:02.969> now<00:01:03.030> it's<00:01:03.989> in

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
going to try that right now it's in

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.140 
going to try that right now it's in
release<00:01:04.500> so<00:01:05.010> we<00:01:05.129> just<00:01:05.280> drop<00:01:05.489> it<00:01:05.519> right<00:01:05.640> down<00:01:05.790> in

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
release so we just drop it right down in

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:11.320 
release so we just drop it right down in
here<00:01:08.869> hopefully<00:01:09.869> this<00:01:09.960> is<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.080> right<00:01:10.290> way<00:01:10.439> I

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:11.330 
here hopefully this is the right way I

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:17.359 
here hopefully this is the right way I
think<00:01:12.330> it<00:01:12.420> might<00:01:12.630> be<00:01:12.659> this<00:01:12.840> way<00:01:16.040> and<00:01:17.040> this<00:01:17.189> is

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
think it might be this way and this is

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:18.830 
think it might be this way and this is
the<00:01:17.460> best<00:01:17.700> way<00:01:17.820> for<00:01:18.030> me<00:01:18.119> to<00:01:18.150> show<00:01:18.450> you<00:01:18.509> so<00:01:18.780> I'll

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
the best way for me to show you so I'll

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.330 
the best way for me to show you so I'll
just<00:01:18.990> turn<00:01:19.080> the<00:01:19.229> console<00:01:19.560> upside<00:01:19.860> down<00:01:20.100> and

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
just turn the console upside down and

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.609 
just turn the console upside down and
just<00:01:20.520> pushed<00:01:20.850> it<00:01:21.060> down<00:01:21.110> so<00:01:22.110> you<00:01:22.140> got<00:01:22.409> both<00:01:22.470> of

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
just pushed it down so you got both of

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.190 
just pushed it down so you got both of
them<00:01:22.890> I<00:01:23.070> release<00:01:23.610> you<00:01:23.850> just<00:01:23.939> turn<00:01:24.299> it<00:01:24.450> to<00:01:24.659> the

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
them I release you just turn it to the

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.640 
them I release you just turn it to the
right<00:01:25.280> bit<00:01:26.280> stiff<00:01:26.580> and<00:01:26.850> it<00:01:27.000> locks<00:01:27.270> in<00:01:27.450> place

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:27.650 
right bit stiff and it locks in place

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:31.190 
right bit stiff and it locks in place
hopefully<00:01:29.240> it<00:01:30.240> should<00:01:30.479> be<00:01:30.630> fine<00:01:30.900> and<00:01:31.140> it

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
hopefully it should be fine and it

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.749 
hopefully it should be fine and it
should<00:01:31.350> be<00:01:31.439> slowly<00:01:31.740> I'm<00:01:31.890> holding<00:01:32.310> this<00:01:32.400> upside

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
should be slowly I'm holding this upside

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.310 
should be slowly I'm holding this upside
down<00:01:32.939> with<00:01:33.119> the<00:01:33.210> lock<00:01:33.360> so<00:01:33.570> you<00:01:34.049> know<00:01:34.170> it<00:01:34.290> is

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
down with the lock so you know it is

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.440 
down with the lock so you know it is
securely<00:01:34.770> in<00:01:34.890> place<00:01:35.040> and<00:01:35.400> you<00:01:35.880> can<00:01:36.030> see<00:01:36.180> how<00:01:36.329> it

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
securely in place and you can see how it

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.770 
securely in place and you can see how it
looks<00:01:36.630> with<00:01:36.750> this<00:01:36.960> stunt<00:01:38.329> doesn't<00:01:39.329> look<00:01:39.600> too
