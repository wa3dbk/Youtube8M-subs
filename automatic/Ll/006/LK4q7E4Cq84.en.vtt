00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.600
 My name is Héctor Ortiz, student of 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.790
 the engineering faculty finished my 

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:13.650
 credits in mechanical engineering 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.840
 process to reduce the volume of 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.789
 unicel already existed however we 

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:20.430
 We wanted to add value to this 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.170
 material in this way we were not just going to 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:26.189
 to be able to contribute to the environment 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:29.220
 generate jobs and exploit a niche of 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.580
 market that was not developed in the 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.529
 country 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:35.120
 the equipment right now is made up of 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:37.170
 Three people are because Luis Hinojosa 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.100
 enrique estrella and his servers 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.890
 terrorists 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:43.510
 we are part of society 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:46.600
 energy and environment of the faculty 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:49.239
 of engineering and in it we are dedicated to 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:52.359
 carry out activities related to 

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:56.260
 promote green practices and among them 

00:00:52.359 --> 00:00:59.229
 We carry out campaigns to collect batteries and 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:01.930
 recycling fairs and spread through 

00:00:59.229 --> 00:01:06.030
 of conferences engineering with a 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:08.470
 green approach, after that we saw that the 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.289
 unicel the expanded collecting 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:14.170
 it was a situation that had to be 

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:15.130
 attend since there was no exit from 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:16.899
 this material 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:19.929
 we had the approach with the company 

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:22.210
 give of mexico with which we sign a 

00:01:19.929 --> 00:01:23.950
 agreement to recycle this material 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:28.000
 do a collection program in the 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:29.710
 faculty and from that arose the 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.960
 idea of ​​being able to make a machine that 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:34.820
 could process us we started 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:38.050
 more than two years ago 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:42.140
 in October 2012 he started the project of 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:45.079
 collection of unicel and we started to 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:48.359
 develop the idea 

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:51.149
 approximately three months later and the 

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:53.819
 machine design took around 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:57.600
 one year while manufacturing took 

00:01:53.819 --> 00:01:59.969
 about 10 months now and this is 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:03.209
 presentation of the machine as such no 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:04.829
 has a competitive ability and a 

00:02:03.209 --> 00:02:07.560
 once our task to develop the 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:12.150
 product and correct all the details 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:14.640
 that will come out of the prototype and good in 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.010
 As regards the disposal of materials, 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.060
 they have statistical data 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:21.629
 specifically polystyrene 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:24.810
 expanded since it is the data that is 

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:28.170
 they have statistics is from the global 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:31.170
 all plastics and good unicel 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:33.920
 it only represents around one 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:36.569
 percentage less than 5% much lower 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:39.120
 good because of this development 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:43.260
 Now we are taking our step as 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:45.629
 small business microenterprise and we founded 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.010
 the company renews that it is a company 

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:49.220
 that will focus on developing 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:51.270
 technologies for waste management 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:53.970
 many times 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:56.460
 it is complicated for young people to be 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:58.050
 developing technology however that 

00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:00.690
 It's something that has to be done in Mexico 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:03.450
 because technological development is the 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:05.280
 basis of economic growth but not 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.320
 only from economic growth but 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.540
 also to grow as a society and 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:12.510
 why not leave something better to the environment 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:14.950
 environment then on the recommendation 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:16.720
 what would you give them is that 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:18.310
 there are going to be many people who put them 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.769
 tickets that tell them that that's already 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:22.989
 fact that it can not be that the 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:25.030
 development they are doing is not worth the 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:29.500
 really worth what is worth is the 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:32.110
 idea not so much the technical part because 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:34.450
 that can correct the part that is 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:36.790
 complicated is having the idea and power 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:38.440
 do from it something that can be 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:40.599
 implement society is useless 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:44.130
 let it be a thesis that remains 

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:44.130
 stored in a database
