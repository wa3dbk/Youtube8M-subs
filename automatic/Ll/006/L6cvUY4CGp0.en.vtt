anyway this is I believe it's the second
fake<00:00:25.199> AV<00:00:25.650> for<00:00:25.920> Mac<00:00:26.150> and<00:00:27.150> it's<00:00:28.019> definitely<00:00:28.590> a

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:29.720 
fake AV for Mac and it's definitely a

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.620 
fake AV for Mac and it's definitely a
most<00:00:30.720> popular<00:00:30.960> one<00:00:31.410> so<00:00:31.650> far<00:00:32.270> so<00:00:33.270> all<00:00:33.450> you<00:00:33.540> have

lot of stuff just happened and let's
analyze<00:00:52.710> this<00:00:52.860> so<00:00:53.010> we've<00:00:53.130> got<00:00:53.280> like<00:00:53.430> a<00:00:53.489> fake

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
analyze this so we've got like a fake

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.890 
analyze this so we've got like a fake

security solution now a couple of things
really<00:02:14.860> finicky<00:02:15.220> with<00:02:15.460> this<00:02:15.700> program<00:02:16.150> one<00:02:16.840> is

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:17.020 
really finicky with this program one is

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:19.440 
really finicky with this program one is
that<00:02:17.170> it<00:02:17.260> crashes<00:02:17.770> a<00:02:17.890> lot<00:02:17.950> and<00:02:18.580> that<00:02:18.970> is<00:02:19.120> a<00:02:19.150> big

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
that it crashes a lot and that is a big

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:23.160 
that it crashes a lot and that is a big
problem<00:02:19.660> so<00:02:20.260> we<00:02:20.440> have<00:02:20.590> to<00:02:20.710> constantly<00:02:22.170> reopen

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
problem so we have to constantly reopen

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:27.060 
problem so we have to constantly reopen
it<00:02:24.570> but<00:02:25.570> I<00:02:25.600> believe<00:02:25.840> it<00:02:25.960> reopens<00:02:26.380> itself<00:02:26.860> from

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:27.070 
it but I believe it reopens itself from

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:29.400 
it but I believe it reopens itself from
time<00:02:27.310> to<00:02:27.430> time<00:02:27.460> so<00:02:28.030> I<00:02:28.450> don't<00:02:28.930> really<00:02:29.140> worry

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
time to time so I don't really worry

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:32.610 
time to time so I don't really worry
about<00:02:29.500> that<00:02:29.680> too<00:02:30.160> much<00:02:31.260> and<00:02:32.260> it<00:02:32.350> seems<00:02:32.530> to<00:02:32.560> only

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
about that too much and it seems to only

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:36.780 
about that too much and it seems to only
crash<00:02:33.190> when<00:02:33.460> like<00:02:34.000> the<00:02:34.180> scan<00:02:34.690> completes<00:02:35.790> so

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
crash when like the scan completes so

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:38.930 
crash when like the scan completes so
I'm<00:02:37.120> going<00:02:37.240> to<00:02:37.300> go<00:02:37.360> ahead<00:02:37.480> and<00:02:37.690> turn<00:02:37.810> that<00:02:37.870> off

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
I'm going to go ahead and turn that off

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:44.410 
I'm going to go ahead and turn that off
then<00:02:41.220> we<00:02:42.220> should<00:02:42.340> be<00:02:42.400> good<00:02:42.430> to<00:02:42.640> go

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 
then we should be good to go

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.290 
then we should be good to go
maybe<00:02:45.020> just<00:02:45.200> pause<00:02:45.410> it<00:02:45.440> so<00:02:46.000> anyway<00:02:47.000> you<00:02:47.060> got

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:47.300 
maybe just pause it so anyway you got

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:49.690 
maybe just pause it so anyway you got
these<00:02:47.450> notifications<00:02:48.230> up<00:02:48.830> here<00:02:49.070> on<00:02:49.310> register

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:31.870 
to change our user edge into Windows

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:36.610 
to change our user edge into Windows
that<00:05:32.870> way<00:05:34.090> we<00:05:35.090> can<00:05:35.240> get<00:05:35.330> a<00:05:35.360> different<00:05:35.690> scanner

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:36.620 
that way we can get a different scanner

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:43.210 
that way we can get a different scanner
check<00:05:37.099> this<00:05:37.250> out

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:43.220 

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:46.810 

nothing<00:05:44.120> is<00:05:44.240> just<00:05:44.270> annoying<00:05:45.280> here<00:05:46.280> I<00:05:46.310> wonder

00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:56.600 

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:59.590 

I<00:05:56.660> guess<00:05:57.440> I<00:05:57.590> can't<00:05:57.800> kill<00:05:58.040> it<00:05:58.070> oh<00:05:58.340> well<00:05:58.790> anyway

00:05:59.590 --> 00:05:59.600 
I guess I can't kill it oh well anyway

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:04.690 
I guess I can't kill it oh well anyway
back<00:05:59.870> to<00:05:59.900> this<00:06:00.170> lets<00:06:00.500> see<00:06:00.710> images<00:06:03.010> Osama<00:06:04.010> bin

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:04.700

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:10.840 

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:12.990 

and<00:06:11.200> now<00:06:11.560> we<00:06:11.620> get<00:06:11.919> the<00:06:12.160> Windows<00:06:12.490> version<00:06:12.730> of

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:13.000 
and now we get the Windows version of

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.840 
and now we get the Windows version of
the<00:06:13.090> scanner<00:06:13.680> so<00:06:14.680> it<00:06:14.860> changes<00:06:15.220> based<00:06:15.520> on<00:06:15.700> your

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:15.850 
the scanner so it changes based on your

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:18.720 
the scanner so it changes based on your
user<00:06:16.060> agent<00:06:16.600> so<00:06:17.200> as<00:06:18.100> you<00:06:18.220> can<00:06:18.310> see<00:06:18.520> it's

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:18.730 
user agent so as you can see it's

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:24.240 
user agent so as you can see it's
definitely<00:06:18.910> a<00:06:21.450> effort<00:06:22.450> by<00:06:22.630> one<00:06:23.139> family<00:06:23.980> of

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:24.250
