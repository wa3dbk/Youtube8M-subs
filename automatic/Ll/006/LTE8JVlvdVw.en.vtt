00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:42.059 

I<00:02:38.580> enjoyed<00:02:39.580> putting<00:02:39.819> the<00:02:40.360> pumpkins<00:02:41.080> scattered

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:40.450 
that go into the distance as you dim the

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:41.820 
that go into the distance as you dim the
lights<00:03:40.660> on<00:03:40.900> the<00:03:41.019> painting<00:03:41.380> you<00:03:41.410> will<00:03:41.620> really

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:41.830

strongly<00:03:46.120> I<00:03:48.780> think<00:03:49.780> the<00:03:49.930> colour<00:03:50.260> composition

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:50.709 
strongly I think the colour composition

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:53.819 
strongly I think the colour composition
in<00:03:51.310> this<00:03:51.489> painting<00:03:51.790> is<00:03:52.180> very<00:03:52.470> complex<00:03:53.470> and

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:53.829 
in this painting is very complex and

00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:56.520 
in this painting is very complex and
took<00:03:54.070> some<00:03:54.310> great<00:03:54.489> thinking<00:03:55.299> as<00:03:55.660> I<00:03:55.720> worked<00:03:56.230> I

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:56.530 
took some great thinking as I worked I

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:58.949 
took some great thinking as I worked I
had<00:03:56.560> to<00:03:57.100> balance<00:03:57.640> an<00:03:58.030> overall<00:03:58.390> warm<00:03:58.660> palette

00:03:58.949 --> 00:03:58.959 
had to balance an overall warm palette

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:02.220 
had to balance an overall warm palette
with<00:03:59.560> cool<00:03:59.980> touches<00:04:00.549> that<00:04:00.910> acted<00:04:01.420> as<00:04:01.660> accents

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:02.230 
with cool touches that acted as accents

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:05.460 
with cool touches that acted as accents
I<00:04:03.060> tried<00:04:04.060> to<00:04:04.209> bring<00:04:04.420> in<00:04:04.540> blue<00:04:04.780> tones<00:04:05.049> wherever

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:05.470 
I tried to bring in blue tones wherever

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:09.599 
I tried to bring in blue tones wherever
I<00:04:05.590> could<00:04:07.079> as<00:04:08.079> a<00:04:08.170> last<00:04:08.500> touch<00:04:08.739> I<00:04:08.980> even<00:04:09.400> painted

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:09.609 
I could as a last touch I even painted

00:04:09.609 --> 00:04:11.759 
I could as a last touch I even painted
the<00:04:09.790> shutters<00:04:09.880> blue<00:04:10.420> just<00:04:10.900> to<00:04:11.170> give<00:04:11.350> it<00:04:11.500> one

00:04:11.759 --> 00:04:11.769 
the shutters blue just to give it one

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:14.009 
the shutters blue just to give it one
more<00:04:11.799> touch<00:04:12.549> of<00:04:12.790> blue<00:04:13.120> that<00:04:13.150> would<00:04:13.600> serve<00:04:13.870> as

00:04:14.009 --> 00:04:14.019 
more touch of blue that would serve as

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:16.930 
more touch of blue that would serve as
an<00:04:14.170> accent

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:16.940 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:20.440 

I<00:04:17.320> think<00:04:18.320> the<00:04:18.440> colors<00:04:18.799> people<00:04:19.220> are<00:04:19.670> using<00:04:20.360> in

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:20.450 
I think the colors people are using in

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:23.140 
I think the colors people are using in
their<00:04:20.600> homes<00:04:20.810> today<00:04:21.110> will<00:04:21.920> make<00:04:22.850> this

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:23.150 
their homes today will make this

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:25.090 
their homes today will make this
painting<00:04:23.660> really<00:04:24.170> appropriate<00:04:24.500> for<00:04:24.770> just

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:25.100 
painting really appropriate for just

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:26.590 
painting really appropriate for just
about<00:04:25.220> any<00:04:25.490> setting<00:04:26.000> there<00:04:26.210> was<00:04:26.300> a<00:04:26.330> lot<00:04:26.570> of

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:26.600 
about any setting there was a lot of

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:29.350 
about any setting there was a lot of
mauve<00:04:26.930> tones<00:04:27.350> there's<00:04:28.010> those<00:04:28.190> rich<00:04:28.520> burgundy
