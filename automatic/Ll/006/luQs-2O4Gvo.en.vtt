00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 Hello, how are we going to learn the 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:06.330
 song of who will decant is a 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.849
 very simple song well I found what 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:12.090
 that were two versions one that is a 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:14.099
 little more or a little quick and dark edition 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.150
 josÃ© that is a little bit slower 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.460
 let's learn what is a little bit 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:20.220
 faster is a very easy song that 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.020
 it is divided into intro stanza and chorus 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.810
 let's start the start here with a 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:27.800
 the least we will go from the first 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.800
 up to the sixth string 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.420
 we go down from the fifth to the 1st 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:41.500
 from the second to the fourth 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:43.860
 I'm afraid what finger number four is 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:47.630
 in what is nothing 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.630
 in the second presentation rope 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:55.250
 first and secondary 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.250
 and then it would be this way 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:06.610
 and I would be ready again for the part 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:10.380
 of our future without using the least 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:10.380
 what is a sun 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:15.420
 john a 

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:18.530
 the council 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.530
 and the sharp 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:26.210
 also my minor 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:29.960
 in radio it would be placed in the smaller one would 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:32.259
 to be 2 down upwards down 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.259
 above 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:56.080
 and so I would say the part of the stanza 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:02:00.010
 then when we finish in me 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:00.010
 we started with a quick fresco 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:06.310
 starts what is the colon and there in the 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:08.880
 How to disaggregate what is the record of 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:08.880
 extra finger 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:14.350
 as we go to start saying who you 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.350
 will sing 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.810
 and well so the song is going to 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:56.209
 bring us to an end 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:03:01.330
