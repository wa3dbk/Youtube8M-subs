Thunderbolt<00:00:37.880> products<00:00:38.210> to<00:00:38.300> show<00:00:38.450> us<00:00:38.630> yeah<00:00:39.350> I

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:39.380 
Thunderbolt products to show us yeah I

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:40.510 
Thunderbolt products to show us yeah I
think<00:00:39.590> Thunderbolts<00:00:40.100> something<00:00:40.400> that

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:40.520 
think Thunderbolts something that

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.040 
think Thunderbolts something that
obviously<00:00:40.610> everybody's<00:00:41.239> talking<00:00:41.630> about<00:00:41.690> you

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:42.050 
obviously everybody's talking about you

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:43.510 
obviously everybody's talking about you
know<00:00:42.140> since<00:00:42.410> apples<00:00:42.770> introduction<00:00:43.250> of<00:00:43.340> that

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:43.520 
know since apples introduction of that

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.540 
know since apples introduction of that
as<00:00:43.700> a<00:00:43.730> solution<00:00:44.180> for<00:00:44.570> taking<00:00:45.380> high<00:00:46.040> bandwidth

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:46.550 
as a solution for taking high bandwidth

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:48.670 
as a solution for taking high bandwidth
so<00:00:46.910> say<00:00:47.300> uncompressed<00:00:47.629> video<00:00:47.870> from<00:00:48.289> one<00:00:48.469> place

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:48.680 
so say uncompressed video from one place

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.470 
so say uncompressed video from one place
to<00:00:48.710> another<00:00:48.940> it<00:00:49.940> was<00:00:50.059> something<00:00:50.329> that<00:00:50.359> really

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:50.480 
to another it was something that really

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.110 
to another it was something that really
kind<00:00:50.870> of<00:00:51.020> we<00:00:51.109> attached<00:00:51.379> ourselves<00:00:51.859> to

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:52.120 
kind of we attached ourselves to

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.549 
kind of we attached ourselves to
obviously<00:00:53.120> NAB<00:00:53.570> we<00:00:53.750> announced<00:00:54.170> the<00:00:54.230> ultra

00:00:54.549 --> 00:00:54.559 
obviously NAB we announced the ultra

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:57.279 
obviously NAB we announced the ultra
studio<00:00:54.920> 3d<00:00:55.280> which<00:00:55.969> had<00:00:56.180> SDI<00:00:56.510> in<00:00:56.780> and<00:00:56.930> out<00:00:57.050> and

00:00:57.279 --> 00:00:57.289 
studio 3d which had SDI in and out and

00:00:57.289 --> 00:00:59.979 
studio 3d which had SDI in and out and
also<00:00:57.530> had<00:00:57.649> hdmi<00:00:57.980> and<00:00:58.280> analog<00:00:58.989> connections

00:00:59.979 --> 00:00:59.989 
also had hdmi and analog connections

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:02.770 
also had hdmi and analog connections
there<00:01:00.199> too<00:01:00.519> we've<00:01:01.519> actually<00:01:01.699> now<00:01:02.090> migrated

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:02.780 
there too we've actually now migrated

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:04.750 
there too we've actually now migrated
even<00:01:02.960> further<00:01:03.199> down<00:01:03.379> the<00:01:03.590> line<00:01:03.739> to<00:01:04.040> showing<00:01:04.519> an

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:04.760 
even further down the line to showing an

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:07.120 
even further down the line to showing an
intensity<00:01:05.510> extreme<00:01:06.050> which<00:01:06.620> is<00:01:06.740> a<00:01:06.770> smaller

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:07.130 
intensity extreme which is a smaller

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:08.920 
intensity extreme which is a smaller
device<00:01:07.280> still<00:01:07.970> Thunder<00:01:08.270> ball<00:01:08.300> 10-bit

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:08.930

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:16.510 
also HD component and SD component also
got<00:01:14.960> s-video<00:01:15.380> and<00:01:15.620> composite<00:01:15.770> connections<00:01:16.400> on

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:16.520 
got s-video and composite connections on

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:18.790 
got s-video and composite connections on
there<00:01:16.670> too<00:01:17.260> nice<00:01:18.260> thing<00:01:18.410> obviously<00:01:18.560> about

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:18.800 
there too nice thing obviously about

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:20.289 
there too nice thing obviously about
Thunderbolt<00:01:19.220> being<00:01:19.400> that<00:01:19.640> you<00:01:19.820> know<00:01:19.939> you<00:01:20.000> can

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:20.299 
Thunderbolt being that you know you can

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:23.319 
Thunderbolt being that you know you can
work<00:01:20.689> with<00:01:20.720> multiple<00:01:20.960> devices<00:01:21.729> and<00:01:22.729> obviously

00:01:23.319 --> 00:01:23.329 
work with multiple devices and obviously

00:01:23.329 --> 00:01:25.390 
work with multiple devices and obviously
you<00:01:23.390> can<00:01:23.570> consolidate<00:01:23.869> your<00:01:24.159> workspace<00:01:25.159> down

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:25.400 
you can consolidate your workspace down

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.249 
you can consolidate your workspace down
quite<00:01:25.610> considerably<00:01:26.119> with<00:01:26.810> the<00:01:26.900> life<00:01:27.079> of

00:01:27.249 --> 00:01:27.259 
quite considerably with the life of

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:29.249 
quite considerably with the life of
storage<00:01:28.070> which<00:01:28.189> is<00:01:28.220> available<00:01:28.820> and<00:01:29.000> also

00:01:29.249 --> 00:01:29.259 
storage which is available and also

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:31.630 
storage which is available and also
obviously<00:01:30.259> capture<00:01:30.649> and<00:01:30.740> playback<00:01:30.799> device<00:01:31.340> it

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:31.640 
obviously capture and playback device it

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.219 
obviously capture and playback device it
means<00:01:32.090> whereas<00:01:32.720> before<00:01:32.840> you'll<00:01:33.140> obviously

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:33.229 
means whereas before you'll obviously

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:35.350 
means whereas before you'll obviously
need<00:01:33.470> a<00:01:33.619> large<00:01:34.070> amount<00:01:34.340> of<00:01:34.430> equipment<00:01:34.640> you're

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:35.360 
need a large amount of equipment you're

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.030 
need a large amount of equipment you're
now<00:01:35.509> able<00:01:35.659> to<00:01:35.899> do<00:01:36.020> this<00:01:36.170> in<00:01:36.380> a<00:01:36.560> much<00:01:36.829> smaller

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:37.040 
now able to do this in a much smaller

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:39.550 
now able to do this in a much smaller
environment<00:01:37.700> so<00:01:38.540> the<00:01:38.689> bandwidth<00:01:39.380> of

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:39.560 
environment so the bandwidth of

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.580 
environment so the bandwidth of
Thunderbolt<00:01:40.070> is<00:01:40.399> so<00:01:40.820> high<00:01:41.090> you<00:01:41.720> can<00:01:41.960> connect

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:42.590 
Thunderbolt is so high you can connect

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:44.200 
Thunderbolt is so high you can connect
storage<00:01:43.009> you<00:01:43.159> can<00:01:43.189> also<00:01:43.399> connect<00:01:43.850> something

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.210 
storage you can also connect something

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:46.209 
storage you can also connect something
to<00:01:44.360> capture<00:01:44.899> uncompressed<00:01:45.530> video<00:01:45.649> streams<00:01:46.100> in

00:01:46.209 --> 00:01:46.219 
to capture uncompressed video streams in

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:48.880 
to capture uncompressed video streams in
the<00:01:46.850> single<00:01:47.240> computer<00:01:47.560> exactly<00:01:48.560> i<00:01:48.590> mean<00:01:48.740> i

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 
the single computer exactly i mean i

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:51.370 
the single computer exactly i mean i
think<00:01:49.130> that<00:01:49.340> really<00:01:49.750> one<00:01:50.750> of<00:01:50.780> the<00:01:50.960> problems

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:51.380 
think that really one of the problems

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:52.990 
think that really one of the problems
that<00:01:51.409> you<00:01:51.619> you've<00:01:51.979> come<00:01:52.250> across<00:01:52.369> before<00:01:52.610> is

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000 
that you you've come across before is

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.120 
that you you've come across before is
that<00:01:53.210> I'm<00:01:53.930> not<00:01:54.140> having<00:01:54.500> that<00:01:54.530> bandwidth

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.130 
that I'm not having that bandwidth

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:56.709 
that I'm not having that bandwidth
you've<00:01:55.399> had<00:01:55.520> to<00:01:55.700> weather<00:01:55.820> compress<00:01:56.509> your

00:01:56.709 --> 00:01:56.719 
you've had to weather compress your

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:58.630 
you've had to weather compress your
video<00:01:56.990> or<00:01:57.079> compromise<00:01:57.710> some<00:01:57.920> quality<00:01:58.369> in<00:01:58.460> some

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.640 
video or compromise some quality in some

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:06.160 
a lot of different pieces of equipment
off<00:02:03.530> a<00:02:03.560> machine<00:02:03.979> or<00:02:04.299> even<00:02:05.299> not<00:02:05.810> being<00:02:05.990> able<00:02:06.049> to

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:07.990 
use a laptop to do certain things

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:10.029 
use a laptop to do certain things
obviously<00:02:08.990> with<00:02:09.110> this<00:02:09.229> new<00:02:09.380> technology<00:02:09.680> from

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:10.039 
obviously with this new technology from

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:12.070 
obviously with this new technology from
Apple<00:02:10.369> and<00:02:10.610> Intel<00:02:11.060> this<00:02:11.390> now<00:02:11.570> means<00:02:11.780> that

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
Apple and Intel this now means that

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:13.540 
Apple and Intel this now means that
obviously<00:02:12.740> we<00:02:12.920> can<00:02:13.100> do<00:02:13.220> all<00:02:13.370> those<00:02:13.490> things

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:13.550 
obviously we can do all those things

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:15.880 
obviously we can do all those things
that<00:02:13.790> we<00:02:13.910> couldn't<00:02:14.120> do<00:02:14.180> before<00:02:14.710> it's<00:02:15.710> quite

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
that we couldn't do before it's quite

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:18.220 
that we couldn't do before it's quite
exciting<00:02:16.250> to<00:02:16.490> see<00:02:16.670> those<00:02:16.850> a<00:02:16.930> storage<00:02:17.930> and<00:02:18.110> data

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
exciting to see those a storage and data

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:19.690 
exciting to see those a storage and data
speeds<00:02:18.590> moving<00:02:18.920> towards<00:02:19.190> the<00:02:19.310> level<00:02:19.550> where

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
speeds moving towards the level where

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.670 
speeds moving towards the level where
video<00:02:20.270> can<00:02:20.480> become<00:02:20.750> kind<00:02:21.020> of<00:02:21.080> like<00:02:21.200> audio<00:02:21.500> is

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
video can become kind of like audio is

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.199 
video can become kind of like audio is
now<00:02:21.860> where<00:02:22.040> you<00:02:22.070> just<00:02:22.340> you<00:02:22.610> take<00:02:22.790> over<00:02:22.970> grants

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:23.209 
now where you just you take over grants

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:24.759 
now where you just you take over grants
as<00:02:23.360> you<00:02:23.420> can<00:02:23.540> work<00:02:23.690> uncompressed<00:02:24.290> it's<00:02:24.650> going

00:02:24.759 --> 00:02:24.769 
as you can work uncompressed it's going

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:26.290 
as you can work uncompressed it's going
to<00:02:24.830> be<00:02:24.920> nice<00:02:25.099> winner<00:02:25.400> when<00:02:25.879> we<00:02:25.940> can<00:02:26.060> get<00:02:26.180> there

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:26.300 
to be nice winner when we can get there

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:27.610 
to be nice winner when we can get there
and<00:02:26.390> I<00:02:26.420> says<00:02:26.569> Thunderbolt<00:02:26.989> products<00:02:27.470> are

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
and I says Thunderbolt products are

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:28.330 
and I says Thunderbolt products are
another<00:02:27.980> set

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
another set

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.580 
another set
was<00:02:28.550> that<00:02:28.760> yes<00:02:29.360> certainly<00:02:29.599> i<00:02:29.810> mean<00:02:30.110> i<00:02:30.200> think

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
was that yes certainly i mean i think

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:31.990 
was that yes certainly i mean i think
that<00:02:30.739> everybody<00:02:31.190> wants<00:02:31.459> to<00:02:31.519> ensure<00:02:31.730> that

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
that everybody wants to ensure that

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.420 
that everybody wants to ensure that
they've<00:02:32.150> got<00:02:32.330> high<00:02:32.840> quality<00:02:33.379> I<00:02:33.560> mean<00:02:34.250> the<00:02:34.310> way

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
they've got high quality I mean the way

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:36.070 
they've got high quality I mean the way
I<00:02:34.459> told<00:02:35.060> us<00:02:35.269> about<00:02:35.330> this<00:02:35.480> before<00:02:35.840> is<00:02:36.050> that

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.080 
I told us about this before is that

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:37.509 
I told us about this before is that
there<00:02:36.500> are<00:02:36.530> three<00:02:36.830> they're<00:02:37.069> usually<00:02:37.160> three

00:02:37.509 --> 00:02:37.519 
there are three they're usually three

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:39.339 
there are three they're usually three
things<00:02:37.819> that<00:02:38.390> we<00:02:38.510> have<00:02:38.660> to<00:02:38.780> consider<00:02:38.959> in

00:02:39.339 --> 00:02:39.349 
things that we have to consider in

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:41.140 
things that we have to consider in
that's<00:02:39.530> cost<00:02:39.830> efficiency<00:02:40.430> and<00:02:40.519> quality<00:02:40.640> in

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
that's cost efficiency and quality in

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:42.670 
that's cost efficiency and quality in
the<00:02:41.629> past<00:02:41.840> what<00:02:41.989> would<00:02:42.110> happen<00:02:42.349> is<00:02:42.440> you<00:02:42.530> do

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
the past what would happen is you do

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.770 
the past what would happen is you do
have<00:02:42.920> to<00:02:43.069> sacrifice<00:02:43.220> one<00:02:43.700> of<00:02:43.730> those<00:02:43.940> three<00:02:44.120> so

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780 
have to sacrifice one of those three so

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:46.150 
have to sacrifice one of those three so
if<00:02:44.840> you<00:02:44.900> want<00:02:45.019> an<00:02:45.110> efficiency<00:02:45.470> in<00:02:45.680> quality<00:02:46.040> it

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:46.160 
if you want an efficiency in quality it

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:47.710 
if you want an efficiency in quality it
cost<00:02:46.340> you<00:02:46.430> a<00:02:46.459> lot<00:02:46.549> of<00:02:46.670> money<00:02:46.790> if<00:02:47.030> you<00:02:47.420> wanted

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
cost you a lot of money if you wanted

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.240 
cost you a lot of money if you wanted
kind<00:02:47.930> of<00:02:48.019> something<00:02:48.230> to<00:02:48.500> be<00:02:48.830> cheap<00:02:49.040> and

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250 
kind of something to be cheap and

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:50.589 
kind of something to be cheap and
efficient<00:02:49.610> they<00:02:49.700> obviously<00:02:49.940> have<00:02:50.510> to

00:02:50.589 --> 00:02:50.599 
efficient they obviously have to

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:52.059 
efficient they obviously have to
compromise<00:02:50.780> the<00:02:51.019> quality<00:02:51.110> and<00:02:51.379> same<00:02:51.799> for<00:02:51.830> the

00:02:52.059 --> 00:02:52.069 
compromise the quality and same for the

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:54.339 
compromise the quality and same for the
other<00:02:52.190> I<00:02:52.879> think<00:02:53.390> what's<00:02:53.540> nice<00:02:53.780> with<00:02:54.019> this<00:02:54.170> now

00:02:54.339 --> 00:02:54.349 
other I think what's nice with this now

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:56.979 
other I think what's nice with this now
is<00:02:54.500> it<00:02:54.680> by<00:02:54.830> bringing<00:02:55.069> this<00:02:55.340> price<00:02:55.580> down<00:02:55.910> to<00:02:56.900> an

00:02:56.979 --> 00:02:56.989 
is it by bringing this price down to an

00:02:56.989 --> 00:02:58.630 
is it by bringing this price down to an
affordable<00:02:57.470> market<00:02:57.860> but<00:02:58.010> been<00:02:58.310> able<00:02:58.489> to

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 
affordable market but been able to

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:01.000 
affordable market but been able to
maintain<00:02:58.760> that<00:02:59.239> efficiency<00:02:59.660> but<00:03:00.440> also<00:03:00.500> have

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
maintain that efficiency but also have

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:03.130 
maintain that efficiency but also have
very<00:03:01.250> high<00:03:01.310> quality<00:03:01.940> this<00:03:02.480> is<00:03:02.630> now<00:03:02.900> really

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:03.140 
very high quality this is now really

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:04.569 
very high quality this is now really
