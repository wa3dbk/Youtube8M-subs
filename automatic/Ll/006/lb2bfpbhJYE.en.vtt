bell<00:00:23.100> crank<00:00:23.400> and<00:00:23.580> as<00:00:23.699> you<00:00:23.850> can<00:00:23.939> see<00:00:24.000> it's<00:00:24.359> a<00:00:24.449> red

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
bell crank and as you can see it's a red

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.849 
bell crank and as you can see it's a red
aluminum<00:00:25.289> and<00:00:25.590> it<00:00:26.580> looks<00:00:26.880> pretty<00:00:27.269> good<00:00:27.859> so

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
aluminum and it looks pretty good so

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.189 
aluminum and it looks pretty good so
this<00:00:29.519> is<00:00:29.550> the<00:00:29.849> traxxas<00:00:30.330> one<00:00:30.539> i<00:00:30.570> also<00:00:30.840> have<00:00:31.080> an

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
this is the traxxas one i also have an

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.790 
this is the traxxas one i also have an
strc<00:00:31.920> that's<00:00:32.759> black<00:00:33.090> on<00:00:33.329> my<00:00:33.450> Rustler<00:00:33.960> but<00:00:34.770> i

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
strc that's black on my Rustler but i

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.620 
strc that's black on my Rustler but i
think<00:00:35.070> the<00:00:35.160> red<00:00:35.399> tracks<00:00:35.730> one<00:00:36.059> looks<00:00:36.329> pretty

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
think the red tracks one looks pretty

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.410 
think the red tracks one looks pretty
nice<00:00:36.780> looking<00:00:37.020> and<00:00:37.730> it's<00:00:38.730> kind<00:00:38.940> of<00:00:38.969> easier<00:00:39.300> to

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
nice looking and it's kind of easier to

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.280 
nice looking and it's kind of easier to
see<00:00:39.570> so<00:00:40.140> i<00:00:40.170> thought<00:00:40.500> i'd<00:00:40.649> do<00:00:40.800> it<00:00:40.950> on<00:00:41.100> that<00:00:41.550> one
