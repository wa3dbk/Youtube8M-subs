the<00:02:31.030> power<00:02:31.209> supply<00:02:31.480> is<00:02:31.870> on<00:02:32.200> the<00:02:32.940> outside<00:02:33.940> since

00:02:34.289 --> 00:02:34.299 
the power supply is on the outside since

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:36.569 
the power supply is on the outside since
it's<00:02:34.450> such<00:02:34.630> a<00:02:34.660> compact<00:02:35.170> system<00:02:35.470> so<00:02:36.400> that's

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:36.579 
it's such a compact system so that's

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:40.470 
it's such a compact system so that's
cool<00:02:36.850> my<00:02:37.510> free<00:02:37.810> mouse<00:02:39.000> go<00:02:40.000> ahead<00:02:40.150> and<00:02:40.299> take<00:02:40.450> it

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
cool my free mouse go ahead and take it

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:43.740 
cool my free mouse go ahead and take it
out<00:02:40.780> for<00:02:41.049> you<00:02:41.260> I<00:02:41.820> can<00:02:42.820> figure<00:02:43.060> this<00:02:43.269> out<00:02:43.480> real

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
out for you I can figure this out real

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:49.240 
out for you I can figure this out real
quick

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:53.059 

and<00:02:50.250> like<00:02:50.370> i<00:02:50.520> said<00:02:50.580> no<00:02:51.000> i<00:02:51.030> have<00:02:51.420> razer<00:02:52.350> mouse

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:53.069 
and like i said no i have razer mouse

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:55.970 
and like i said no i have razer mouse
and<00:02:53.459> razer<00:02:53.670> keyboard<00:02:53.940> say<00:02:54.540> I<00:02:54.870> just<00:02:55.440> hit<00:02:55.800> these

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
and razer keyboard say I just hit these

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.010 
and razer keyboard say I just hit these
because<00:02:56.280> they<00:02:56.400> are<00:02:56.430> free<00:02:56.850> and<00:02:57.510> I'm<00:02:57.780> going<00:02:57.990> to

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:58.020 
because they are free and I'm going to

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:01.760 
because they are free and I'm going to
put<00:02:58.350> them<00:02:58.650> on<00:02:59.130> my<00:02:59.190> older<00:03:00.150> computer<00:03:00.780> and<00:03:01.740> just

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:01.770 
put them on my older computer and just

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:09.080 
put them on my older computer and just
use<00:03:02.670> that<00:03:02.700> computer<00:03:03.030> in<00:03:03.390> my<00:03:03.540> room<00:03:04.730> and<00:03:08.090> pretty

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
use that computer in my room and pretty

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:12.890 
use that computer in my room and pretty
much<00:03:09.120> just<00:03:09.420> the<00:03:09.620> other<00:03:10.620> end<00:03:10.950> of<00:03:11.280> the<00:03:11.900> power

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
much just the other end of the power

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.380 
much just the other end of the power
brick<00:03:14.600> so<00:03:15.600> i<00:03:15.630> can<00:03:15.870> plug<00:03:16.020> it<00:03:16.170> into<00:03:16.320> the<00:03:16.530> wall

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:17.390 
brick so i can plug it into the wall

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:21.290 
brick so i can plug it into the wall
that's<00:03:18.390> pretty<00:03:18.750> much<00:03:18.930> it<00:03:19.230> I<00:03:19.709> mean<00:03:20.069> for<00:03:20.459> the

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:21.300 
that's pretty much it I mean for the

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:24.050 
that's pretty much it I mean for the
unboxing<00:03:21.570> of<00:03:21.930> this<00:03:22.140> I<00:03:22.410> may<00:03:23.280> do<00:03:23.340> some<00:03:23.730> kind<00:03:23.970> of

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
unboxing of this I may do some kind of

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:25.820 
unboxing of this I may do some kind of
review<00:03:24.420> and<00:03:24.930> if<00:03:25.020> you<00:03:25.140> can<00:03:25.230> see<00:03:25.410> it<00:03:25.440> compared<00:03:25.709> my

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:25.830 
review and if you can see it compared my

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:29.120 
review and if you can see it compared my
hands<00:03:25.980> I<00:03:26.100> have<00:03:26.220> smaller<00:03:26.519> hands<00:03:26.820> so<00:03:28.130> it's

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130 
hands I have smaller hands so it's

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:32.240 
hands I have smaller hands so it's
pretty<00:03:29.430> decent<00:03:29.730> size<00:03:30.380> but<00:03:31.380> I<00:03:31.680> might<00:03:32.070> do<00:03:32.220> a

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
pretty decent size but I might do a

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:35.150 
pretty decent size but I might do a
review<00:03:32.700> this<00:03:32.880> product<00:03:33.260> I<00:03:34.260> don't<00:03:34.920> play<00:03:35.100> too

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.160 
review this product I don't play too

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:39.910 
review this product I don't play too
many<00:03:35.610> pc<00:03:36.030> games<00:03:36.269> mostly<00:03:36.720> rpgs<00:03:37.470> and<00:03:37.610> mmos<00:03:38.610> so<00:03:39.450> i

might get around to a review maybe maybe
not<00:03:43.290> but<00:03:43.800> that's<00:03:44.519> pretty<00:03:44.640> much<00:03:44.730> it<00:03:44.820> with<00:03:45.150> the

x51 on the thing that what i will say

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:52.520 
x51 on the thing that what i will say
about<00:03:50.370> it<00:03:50.550> is<00:03:50.700> when<00:03:50.940> you<00:03:51.030> go<00:03:51.150> into<00:03:51.530> alienware

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
about it is when you go into alienware

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:54.920 
about it is when you go into alienware
its<00:03:52.650> website<00:03:53.070> you<00:03:53.730> have<00:03:53.760> a<00:03:53.940> few<00:03:54.239> options<00:03:54.299> to

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
its website you have a few options to

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:56.390 
its website you have a few options to
select<00:03:55.079> from<00:03:55.320> and<00:03:55.650> then<00:03:55.799> you<00:03:55.890> build<00:03:56.100> it<00:03:56.280> from

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
select from and then you build it from

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.120 
select from and then you build it from
there<00:03:56.700> I<00:03:57.500> didn't<00:03:58.500> pick<00:03:58.650> the<00:03:58.799> most<00:03:58.950> expensive

00:03:59.120 --> 00:03:59.130 
there I didn't pick the most expensive

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:02.090 
there I didn't pick the most expensive
one<00:03:59.790> I<00:04:00.060> pick<00:04:00.600> the<00:04:00.900> next<00:04:01.200> to<00:04:01.829> the<00:04:01.920> most

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:02.100 
one I pick the next to the most

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:04.250 
one I pick the next to the most
expensive<00:04:02.459> one<00:04:02.790> and<00:04:03.030> then<00:04:03.720> i<00:04:03.810> just<00:04:03.870> added

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
expensive one and then i just added

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.600 
expensive one and then i just added
everything<00:04:04.739> up<00:04:06.019> upgraded<00:04:07.019> everything<00:04:07.320> I<00:04:07.410> mean

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:07.610 
everything up upgraded everything I mean

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:11.300 
everything up upgraded everything I mean
until<00:04:08.610> I<00:04:08.940> got<00:04:09.420> to<00:04:09.450> the<00:04:09.630> hard<00:04:09.930> drive<00:04:10.200> and<00:04:10.470> I<00:04:11.040> left

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 
until I got to the hard drive and I left

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:14.330 
until I got to the hard drive and I left
it<00:04:11.549> as<00:04:11.760> the<00:04:12.060> old<00:04:12.750> stable<00:04:13.170> type<00:04:13.769> hard<00:04:14.010> drives

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.340 
it as the old stable type hard drives

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:17.530 
it as the old stable type hard drives
and<00:04:15.269> got<00:04:15.450> two<00:04:15.600> terabytes<00:04:16.079> instead<00:04:16.979> of<00:04:17.010> doing

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:17.540 
and got two terabytes instead of doing

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:20.000 
and got two terabytes instead of doing
like<00:04:18.540> the<00:04:18.750> most<00:04:18.930> expensive<00:04:19.229> model<00:04:19.799> and<00:04:19.919> go

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.010 
like the most expensive model and go

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:23.270 
like the most expensive model and go
with<00:04:20.100> the<00:04:20.160> SSD<00:04:20.760> hard<00:04:20.790> drive<00:04:21.560> yes<00:04:22.560> the<00:04:22.800> SSDs<00:04:23.250> a

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 
with the SSD hard drive yes the SSDs a

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:26.060 
with the SSD hard drive yes the SSDs a
lot<00:04:23.520> faster<00:04:24.000> but<00:04:24.300> I'm<00:04:24.660> I<00:04:25.260> kind<00:04:25.680> of<00:04:25.740> worn<00:04:25.919> all

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:26.070 
lot faster but I'm I kind of worn all

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:28.219 
lot faster but I'm I kind of worn all
the<00:04:26.190> memory<00:04:26.520> for<00:04:26.970> doing<00:04:27.510> videos<00:04:27.840> and<00:04:28.080> stuff

00:04:28.219 --> 00:04:28.229 
the memory for doing videos and stuff

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:31.100 
the memory for doing videos and stuff
like<00:04:28.380> that<00:04:28.440> and<00:04:28.970> so<00:04:29.970> I<00:04:30.000> decided<00:04:30.510> just<00:04:30.660> to<00:04:30.900> get

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:31.110 
like that and so I decided just to get

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:33.320 
like that and so I decided just to get
the<00:04:31.229> one<00:04:31.380> with<00:04:31.410> that<00:04:31.740> better<00:04:32.520> memory<00:04:32.910> so<00:04:33.120> I<00:04:33.180> got

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:33.330 
the one with that better memory so I got

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:36.140 
the one with that better memory so I got
two<00:04:33.479> terabytes<00:04:33.930> instead<00:04:34.410> of<00:04:34.500> like<00:04:34.710> a<00:04:35.120> 250<00:04:36.120> gig

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:36.150 
two terabytes instead of like a 250 gig

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:41.150 
two terabytes instead of like a 250 gig
SSD<00:04:37.880> long<00:04:38.880> run<00:04:39.240> I<00:04:39.690> don't<00:04:40.590> really<00:04:40.740> know<00:04:41.010> if

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:41.160 
SSD long run I don't really know if

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:44.330 
SSD long run I don't really know if
that's<00:04:41.370> going<00:04:41.580> to<00:04:41.640> be<00:04:42.510> two<00:04:42.870> crucial<00:04:43.229> or<00:04:43.770> down

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:44.340 
that's going to be two crucial or down

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:47.240 
that's going to be two crucial or down
bahan<00:04:44.910> I'm<00:04:45.180> going<00:04:45.360> to<00:04:45.450> be<00:04:45.950> upset<00:04:46.950> with<00:04:47.070> myself

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:47.250 
bahan I'm going to be upset with myself

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:49.790 
bahan I'm going to be upset with myself
and<00:04:47.520> want<00:04:47.700> to<00:04:47.850> upgrade<00:04:47.970> it<00:04:48.380> but<00:04:49.380> that's<00:04:49.680> pretty

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:49.800 
and want to upgrade it but that's pretty
