said<00:01:56.840> yeah<00:01:57.170> I<00:01:57.200> do<00:01:57.320> and<00:01:57.650> then<00:01:58.580> I<00:01:58.640> was<00:01:58.790> hooked<00:01:59.030> and

00:01:59.170 --> 00:01:59.180 
said yeah I do and then I was hooked and

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:01.120 
said yeah I do and then I was hooked and
I<00:01:59.300> bought<00:01:59.480> myself<00:01:59.690> aboard<00:02:00.230> and<00:02:00.500> took<00:02:00.980> it<00:02:01.010> home

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.130 
I bought myself aboard and took it home

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.580 
I bought myself aboard and took it home
that<00:02:01.880> summer<00:02:02.180> and<00:02:02.510> started<00:02:03.200> doing<00:02:03.410> in<00:02:03.500> the

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:03.590 
that summer and started doing in the

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:05.800 
that summer and started doing in the
rivers<00:02:03.860> and<00:02:04.100> that<00:02:04.940> was<00:02:05.120> really<00:02:05.270> my<00:02:05.480> fix

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:05.810 
rivers and that was really my fix

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:07.300 
rivers and that was really my fix
because<00:02:06.080> I<00:02:06.350> was<00:02:06.470> missing<00:02:06.800> the<00:02:06.890> ocean<00:02:07.160> and

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:07.310 
because I was missing the ocean and

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:09.190 
because I was missing the ocean and
serving<00:02:07.670> so<00:02:07.820> much<00:02:08.030> once<00:02:08.630> I<00:02:08.720> discovered<00:02:08.929> the

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200 
serving so much once I discovered the

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:10.719 
serving so much once I discovered the
standing<00:02:09.590> waves<00:02:09.740> in<00:02:09.920> the<00:02:09.950> river<00:02:10.190> then<00:02:10.429> I<00:02:10.550> could

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729 
standing waves in the river then I could

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:13.330 
standing waves in the river then I could
actually<00:02:11.530> spend<00:02:12.530> some<00:02:12.710> time<00:02:12.920> in<00:02:13.070> the<00:02:13.130> river

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
actually spend some time in the river

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:14.410 
actually spend some time in the river
and<00:02:13.430> get<00:02:13.640> knocked<00:02:13.820> around<00:02:13.940> by<00:02:14.120> the<00:02:14.240> white

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
and get knocked around by the white

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.060 
and get knocked around by the white
water<00:02:14.600> in<00:02:14.810> the<00:02:14.960> current<00:02:15.320> which<00:02:15.500> shows<00:02:15.740> what<00:02:16.040> I

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:16.070 
water in the current which shows what I

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:19.420 
water in the current which shows what I
was<00:02:16.220> missing<00:02:16.400> from<00:02:16.670> the<00:02:16.850> ocean<00:02:18.130> rush<00:02:19.130> is

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
was missing from the ocean rush is

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:22.030 
was missing from the ocean rush is
comparable<00:02:20.390> just<00:02:21.200> standing<00:02:21.620> up<00:02:21.710> in<00:02:21.860> flat

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
comparable just standing up in flat

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.020 
comparable just standing up in flat
water<00:02:22.220> this<00:02:22.400> is<00:02:22.459> still<00:02:22.790> a<00:02:22.820> rush<00:02:23.060> for<00:02:23.270> me<00:02:23.740> the

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
water this is still a rush for me the

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:27.760 
water this is still a rush for me the
change<00:02:26.030> just<00:02:26.390> like<00:02:26.450> in<00:02:26.630> the<00:02:26.690> ocean<00:02:27.080> when

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:27.770 
change just like in the ocean when

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:29.050 
change just like in the ocean when
you're<00:02:27.890> pedaling<00:02:28.010> the<00:02:28.280> river<00:02:28.430> being<00:02:28.790> able<00:02:28.970> to

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
you're pedaling the river being able to

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.540 
you're pedaling the river being able to
see<00:02:29.360> from<00:02:29.690> that<00:02:29.930> height<00:02:30.340> instead<00:02:31.340> of<00:02:31.400> the

actual scanning height and be able to
look<00:02:34.430> at<00:02:34.580> the<00:02:34.670> river<00:02:34.850> that<00:02:35.060> way<00:02:35.209> very<00:02:36.170> similar

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.410 
look at the river that way very similar

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:37.900 
look at the river that way very similar
be<00:02:36.590> able<00:02:36.740> to<00:02:36.800> see<00:02:36.980> the<00:02:37.070> waves<00:02:37.250> coming<00:02:37.610> in<00:02:37.760> from

be able to see the waves coming in from

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:39.610 
be able to see the waves coming in from
the<00:02:38.000> horizon<00:02:38.450> Santa<00:02:39.050> paddling<00:02:39.350> in<00:02:39.410> the<00:02:39.470> river

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
the horizon Santa paddling in the river

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:40.720 
the horizon Santa paddling in the river
is<00:02:39.740> quite<00:02:39.890> a<00:02:39.920> bit<00:02:40.100> different<00:02:40.220> because<00:02:40.459> you

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
is quite a bit different because you

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:42.160 
is quite a bit different because you
really<00:02:41.060> don't<00:02:41.239> have<00:02:41.330> much<00:02:41.390> all<00:02:41.720> speed<00:02:41.989> unless

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
really don't have much all speed unless

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:44.290 
really don't have much all speed unless
you're<00:02:42.530> surfing<00:02:42.680> a<00:02:42.920> standing<00:02:43.310> wave<00:02:43.430> most<00:02:44.120> the

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:44.300 
you're surfing a standing wave most the

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:46.330 
you're surfing a standing wave most the
time<00:02:44.480> you're<00:02:44.690> going<00:02:44.870> the<00:02:45.680> same<00:02:45.890> speed<00:02:46.190> of<00:02:46.280> the

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
time you're going the same speed of the

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.520 
time you're going the same speed of the
current<00:02:46.489> or<00:02:46.790> maybe<00:02:47.000> a<00:02:47.120> knot<00:02:47.360> or<00:02:47.390> two<00:02:47.690> faster<00:02:48.260> so

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
current or maybe a knot or two faster so

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:52.660 
current or maybe a knot or two faster so
it's<00:02:49.370> quite<00:02:49.580> a<00:02:49.640> bit<00:02:49.820> less<00:02:50.120> stable<00:02:50.450> than<00:02:51.520> it<00:02:52.520> is

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:52.670 
it's quite a bit less stable than it is

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:54.550 
it's quite a bit less stable than it is
in<00:02:52.850> the<00:02:52.910> ocean<00:02:53.300> where<00:02:54.200> you're<00:02:54.440> either

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
in the ocean where you're either

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.650 
in the ocean where you're either
paddling<00:02:55.070> in<00:02:55.130> flat<00:02:55.370> water<00:02:55.550> or<00:02:55.820> you're<00:02:56.480> gliding

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:56.660 
paddling in flat water or you're gliding

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:58.540 
paddling in flat water or you're gliding
on<00:02:56.900> a<00:02:56.930> wave<00:02:57.110> and<00:02:57.260> you<00:02:57.350> have<00:02:57.500> whole<00:02:57.680> speed<00:02:57.980> one

00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:58.550 
on a wave and you have whole speed one

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:00.580 
on a wave and you have whole speed one
of<00:02:58.640> the<00:02:58.700> more<00:02:58.790> challenging<00:02:58.850> things<00:02:59.660> stand<00:03:00.500> up

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 
of the more challenging things stand up

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:02.620 
of the more challenging things stand up
paddling<00:03:00.890> in<00:03:00.950> the<00:03:01.040> river<00:03:01.220> is<00:03:01.910> going<00:03:02.330> through<00:03:02.600> a

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:02.630 
paddling in the river is going through a

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:04.960 
paddling in the river is going through a
wave<00:03:03.019> train<00:03:03.320> so<00:03:03.830> you<00:03:03.950> have<00:03:04.160> sets<00:03:04.459> of<00:03:04.610> waves<00:03:04.790> in

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:04.970 
wave train so you have sets of waves in

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:07.120 
wave train so you have sets of waves in
the<00:03:05.000> ocean<00:03:05.090> and<00:03:05.570> the<00:03:06.320> river<00:03:06.500> you<00:03:06.620> called<00:03:06.920> out

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:07.130 
the ocean and the river you called out

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:09.430 
the ocean and the river you called out
the<00:03:07.400> same<00:03:07.670> sort<00:03:07.970> of<00:03:08.030> phenomenon<00:03:08.150> wave<00:03:09.049> train

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:09.440 
the same sort of phenomenon wave train

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:12.070 
the same sort of phenomenon wave train
the<00:03:09.890> waves<00:03:10.130> and<00:03:10.430> the<00:03:10.519> rivers<00:03:11.299> obviously<00:03:11.900> most

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:12.080 
the waves and the rivers obviously most

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:13.750 
the waves and the rivers obviously most
lease<00:03:12.290> much<00:03:12.590> smaller<00:03:12.950> than<00:03:13.130> the<00:03:13.340> ocean<00:03:13.459> on

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760 
lease much smaller than the ocean on

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.180 
lease much smaller than the ocean on
average<00:03:14.090> but<00:03:14.600> they're<00:03:14.840> a<00:03:14.870> wave<00:03:15.680> period<00:03:16.100> is

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:16.190 
average but they're a wave period is

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:17.949 
average but they're a wave period is
much<00:03:16.370> smaller<00:03:16.670> so<00:03:17.090> you're<00:03:17.330> going<00:03:17.540> hitting<00:03:17.810> one

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:17.959 
much smaller so you're going hitting one

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:19.330 
much smaller so you're going hitting one
wave<00:03:18.140> then<00:03:18.380> the<00:03:18.440> next<00:03:18.560> on<00:03:18.769> the<00:03:18.799> next<00:03:18.890> so<00:03:19.220> it's

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:19.340 
wave then the next on the next so it's

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:20.289 
wave then the next on the next so it's
kind<00:03:19.580> of<00:03:19.610> like<00:03:19.700> going<00:03:19.910> through<00:03:19.970> a<00:03:20.120> mobile

00:03:20.289 --> 00:03:20.299 
kind of like going through a mobile

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:22.509 
kind of like going through a mobile
field<00:03:20.690> on<00:03:20.870> your<00:03:21.019> skis<00:03:21.230> or<00:03:21.440> a<00:03:21.470> snowboard<00:03:21.950> so<00:03:22.459> you

00:03:22.509 --> 00:03:22.519 
field on your skis or a snowboard so you

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:23.830 
field on your skis or a snowboard so you
really<00:03:22.820> have<00:03:22.850> to<00:03:22.970> have<00:03:23.150> constantly<00:03:23.630> loose

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:23.840 
really have to have constantly loose

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.010 
really have to have constantly loose
ankles

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:25.020 
ankles

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:27.590 
ankles
that<00:03:25.590> that<00:03:26.040> became<00:03:26.730> easier<00:03:27.120> after<00:03:27.270> a<00:03:27.450> while

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.600 
that that became easier after a while

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.100 
that that became easier after a while
and<00:03:27.870> then<00:03:28.650> the<00:03:28.830> rest<00:03:29.010> of<00:03:29.130> the<00:03:29.190> time<00:03:29.430> it's<00:03:29.730> also

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:30.110 
and then the rest of the time it's also

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:32.600

suitable for the river is that we needed

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:53.960 
suitable for the river is that we needed
to<00:03:52.350> have<00:03:52.530> the<00:03:52.740> rocker<00:03:53.130> profile<00:03:53.550> be<00:03:53.730> quite<00:03:53.940> a

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
to have the rocker profile be quite a

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
a little bit extra width because you

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.380 
a little bit extra width because you

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:06.390 
need a little more stability again

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:08.300 
need a little more stability again
because<00:04:06.720> you're<00:04:06.900> not<00:04:06.990> planning<00:04:07.620> it's<00:04:07.920> not

you're surfing and even when you're

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:13.410 
surfing the standing waves are a little

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:14.780 
surfing the standing waves are a little
bit<00:04:13.560> slower<00:04:13.860> than<00:04:14.100> what<00:04:14.310> you<00:04:14.370> have<00:04:14.580> in<00:04:14.700> the

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 
bit slower than what you have in the

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:17.090 
bit slower than what you have in the
ocean<00:04:15.090> the<00:04:15.420> fins<00:04:15.720> the<00:04:16.350> rubber<00:04:16.560> fins<00:04:16.920> that

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:17.100 
ocean the fins the rubber fins that

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:18.860 
ocean the fins the rubber fins that
they're<00:04:17.459> used<00:04:17.670> for<00:04:17.760> beginners<00:04:18.209> in<00:04:18.390> the<00:04:18.510> ocean

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:18.870 
they're used for beginners in the ocean

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:21.289 
they're used for beginners in the ocean
are<00:04:19.020> perfect<00:04:19.560> for<00:04:19.680> the<00:04:19.770> river<00:04:19.980> because<00:04:20.790> the

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:21.299 
are perfect for the river because the

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:23.630 
are perfect for the river because the
rubber<00:04:21.480> fins<00:04:21.840> then<00:04:22.230> with<00:04:23.040> you<00:04:23.190> hit<00:04:23.340> a<00:04:23.370> rock

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:23.640 
rubber fins then with you hit a rock

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:25.310 
rubber fins then with you hit a rock
you're<00:04:24.000> less<00:04:24.360> likely<00:04:24.390> to<00:04:24.690> get<00:04:24.840> launched<00:04:25.200> off

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:25.320 
you're less likely to get launched off

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:27.020 
you're less likely to get launched off
your<00:04:25.470> board<00:04:25.620> and<00:04:25.770> break<00:04:25.920> a<00:04:25.950> fin<00:04:26.250> so<00:04:26.850> that's

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:27.030 
your board and break a fin so that's

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:29.510 
your board and break a fin so that's
pretty<00:04:27.270> nice<00:04:27.450> plus<00:04:27.840> you<00:04:28.080> want<00:04:28.350> the<00:04:28.890> fins<00:04:29.400> and

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.520 
pretty nice plus you want the fins and

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.070 
pretty nice plus you want the fins and
the<00:04:29.610> river<00:04:29.760> to<00:04:29.940> be<00:04:30.060> looser<00:04:30.510> I<00:04:30.720> have<00:04:30.930> been

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:31.080 
the river to be looser I have been

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:32.780 
the river to be looser I have been
cutting<00:04:31.290> down<00:04:31.620> the<00:04:31.800> old<00:04:31.920> fence<00:04:32.190> quite<00:04:32.490> short

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:32.790 
cutting down the old fence quite short

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:34.790 
cutting down the old fence quite short
four<00:04:33.030> or<00:04:33.120> five<00:04:33.270> inches<00:04:33.480> so<00:04:34.260> that<00:04:34.440> the<00:04:34.560> tail

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800 
four or five inches so that the tail

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:37.310 
four or five inches so that the tail
will<00:04:35.010> swing<00:04:35.190> around<00:04:35.310> much<00:04:35.580> more<00:04:35.820> easily<00:04:35.970> or<00:04:36.960> be

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:37.320 
will swing around much more easily or be

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:39.860 
will swing around much more easily or be
less<00:04:37.500> affected<00:04:37.980> by<00:04:38.010> a<00:04:38.160> counter-current<00:04:38.870> so

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:39.870 
less affected by a counter-current so

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:42.380 
less affected by a counter-current so
rubber<00:04:40.140> fence<00:04:40.580> being<00:04:41.580> loose<00:04:41.790> or<00:04:42.000> really

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:42.390 
rubber fence being loose or really

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:44.360 
rubber fence being loose or really
really<00:04:42.630> helped<00:04:42.840> and<00:04:43.650> then<00:04:43.800> the<00:04:43.890> foot<00:04:44.100> straps

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:44.370 
really helped and then the foot straps

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:48.050 
really helped and then the foot straps
are<00:04:44.670> really<00:04:45.510> cool<00:04:45.750> for<00:04:46.560> two<00:04:46.740> reasons<00:04:47.060> really

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:48.060 
are really cool for two reasons really

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:49.760 
are really cool for two reasons really
class<00:04:48.360> 1<00:04:48.660> and<00:04:48.690> 2<00:04:48.990> water<00:04:49.230> you<00:04:49.440> don't<00:04:49.530> really

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:49.770 
class 1 and 2 water you don't really

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:51.320 
class 1 and 2 water you don't really
need<00:04:49.890> them<00:04:50.100> once<00:04:50.610> you<00:04:50.700> get<00:04:50.820> into<00:04:50.940> intermediate

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:51.330 
need them once you get into intermediate

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:53.540 
need them once you get into intermediate
water<00:04:51.630> class<00:04:52.020> 3<00:04:52.380> and<00:04:52.560> expert<00:04:52.860> water<00:04:53.010> class<00:04:53.250> 4

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:53.550 
water class 3 and expert water class 4

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:56.330 
water class 3 and expert water class 4
and<00:04:53.580> above<00:04:53.730> the<00:04:54.690> foot<00:04:54.870> straps<00:04:55.170> are<00:04:55.920> great<00:04:56.160> for

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:56.340 
and above the foot straps are great for

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:58.460 
and above the foot straps are great for
two<00:04:56.520> reasons<00:04:56.700> one<00:04:57.060> is<00:04:57.210> that<00:04:57.240> if<00:04:57.930> you<00:04:58.110> fall<00:04:58.440> you

00:04:58.460 --> 00:04:58.470 
two reasons one is that if you fall you

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:00.680 
two reasons one is that if you fall you
generally<00:04:59.010> still<00:04:59.190> have<00:04:59.310> a<00:04:59.340> foot<00:04:59.580> on<00:04:59.760> the<00:05:00.450> board

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:00.690 
generally still have a foot on the board

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:02.900 
generally still have a foot on the board
and<00:05:00.870> you<00:05:01.050> have<00:05:01.230> a<00:05:01.260> quick<00:05:01.530> grab<00:05:01.950> a<00:05:02.220> quick<00:05:02.460> a<00:05:02.490> hand

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:02.910 
and you have a quick grab a quick a hand

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:05.840 
and you have a quick grab a quick a hand
to<00:05:03.120> grab<00:05:03.300> it<00:05:03.360> also<00:05:04.230> you<00:05:05.040> can<00:05:05.070> flip<00:05:05.370> upside<00:05:05.700> down

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:05.850 
to grab it also you can flip upside down

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:06.980 
to grab it also you can flip upside down
and<00:05:06.030> actually<00:05:06.150> roll<00:05:06.480> the<00:05:06.600> board<00:05:06.780> like<00:05:06.900> to

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:06.990 
and actually roll the board like to

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:09.260 
and actually roll the board like to
kayak<00:05:07.230> which<00:05:07.890> is<00:05:08.070> quite<00:05:08.250> unique<00:05:08.430> and<00:05:08.790> fun<00:05:09.120> to

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:09.270 
kayak which is quite unique and fun to

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:10.750 
kayak which is quite unique and fun to
do

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:10.760 
do

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:12.890 
do
it's<00:05:11.760> a<00:05:11.820> great<00:05:12.000> question<00:05:12.240> you<00:05:12.510> asked<00:05:12.720> about

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:12.900

the<00:05:17.580> river<00:05:17.810> they're<00:05:18.810> really<00:05:19.020> it's<00:05:19.740> pretty

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:19.980 
the river they're really it's pretty

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:21.500 
the river they're really it's pretty
nice<00:05:20.190> that<00:05:20.490> really<00:05:20.760> has<00:05:20.940> been<00:05:21.150> very<00:05:21.390> good

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:21.510 
nice that really has been very good

nice that really has been very good
acceptance<00:05:21.960> they're<00:05:22.400> probably<00:05:23.400> because<00:05:23.970> the

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:24.120 
acceptance they're probably because the

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:27.050 
acceptance they're probably because the
etiquette<00:05:24.630> in<00:05:25.470> the<00:05:26.010> river<00:05:26.220> is<00:05:26.460> such<00:05:26.670> that<00:05:26.880> you

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:27.060 
etiquette in the river is such that you

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:29.060 
etiquette in the river is such that you
as<00:05:27.240> far<00:05:27.870> as<00:05:27.990> surfing<00:05:28.410> away<00:05:28.650> of<00:05:28.800> you<00:05:28.890> actually

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:29.070 
as far as surfing away of you actually

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:31.190 
as far as surfing away of you actually
wait<00:05:29.490> in<00:05:29.640> line<00:05:29.820> you<00:05:30.480> get<00:05:30.630> in<00:05:30.720> what's<00:05:30.900> called<00:05:31.050> an

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:31.200 
wait in line you get in what's called an

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:33.080 
wait in line you get in what's called an
eddy<00:05:31.410> which<00:05:31.920> is<00:05:32.070> a<00:05:32.100> resting<00:05:32.670> your<00:05:32.730> counter

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:33.090 
eddy which is a resting your counter

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:34.340 
eddy which is a resting your counter
current<00:05:33.390> to<00:05:33.480> the<00:05:33.510> main<00:05:33.720> current<00:05:34.110> and

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:34.350 
current to the main current and

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:36.080 
current to the main current and
everybody<00:05:34.770> actually<00:05:35.100> weights<00:05:35.310> their<00:05:35.640> turn<00:05:35.910> to

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:36.090 
everybody actually weights their turn to

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:37.970 
everybody actually weights their turn to
get<00:05:36.270> on<00:05:36.300> the<00:05:36.450> way<00:05:36.570> well<00:05:37.530> the<00:05:37.620> reason<00:05:37.770> this

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:37.980 
get on the way well the reason this

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:39.620 
get on the way well the reason this
works<00:05:38.190> is<00:05:38.460> unlike<00:05:38.820> the<00:05:38.970> ocean<00:05:39.330> you<00:05:39.480> have<00:05:39.600> a

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:39.630 
works is unlike the ocean you have a

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:41.330 
works is unlike the ocean you have a
standing<00:05:40.050> wave<00:05:40.230> that's<00:05:40.590> pretty<00:05:40.980> much<00:05:41.130> there

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:41.340 
standing wave that's pretty much there

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:44.990 
standing wave that's pretty much there
24<00:05:41.790> 7<00:05:42.150> 365<00:05:42.600> so<00:05:43.470> the<00:05:43.620> resource<00:05:44.070> is<00:05:44.520> a<00:05:44.640> lot

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:45.000 
24 7 365 so the resource is a lot

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.410 
24 7 365 so the resource is a lot
greater<00:05:45.530> granted<00:05:46.530> it's<00:05:46.680> not<00:05:46.860> as<00:05:47.430> dynamic<00:05:47.820> in<00:05:48.360> a

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:48.420 
greater granted it's not as dynamic in a

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:50.570 
greater granted it's not as dynamic in a
lot<00:05:48.540> of<00:05:48.570> ways<00:05:48.750> as<00:05:48.930> an<00:05:49.080> ocean<00:05:49.230> wave<00:05:49.410> but<00:05:50.160> there's

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:50.580 
lot of ways as an ocean wave but there's

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:52.220 
lot of ways as an ocean wave but there's
many<00:05:50.850> more<00:05:51.060> standing<00:05:51.450> waves<00:05:51.660> that<00:05:51.990> are

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:52.230 
many more standing waves that are

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:55.550 
many more standing waves that are
constantly<00:05:52.590> running<00:05:53.070> so<00:05:53.430> it's<00:05:54.230> that<00:05:55.230> that

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:55.560 
constantly running so it's that that

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:57.410 
constantly running so it's that that
that<00:05:55.920> presence<00:05:56.520> of<00:05:56.640> resource<00:05:56.970> really<00:05:57.240> makes

00:05:57.410 --> 00:05:57.420 
that presence of resource really makes

00:05:57.420 --> 00:06:00.860 
that presence of resource really makes
it<00:05:58.250> acceptability<00:05:59.250> about<00:05:59.550> the<00:05:59.640> crap<00:05:59.910> I<00:06:00.270> work

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:00.870 
it acceptability about the crap I work

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:06.650 
it acceptability about the crap I work
