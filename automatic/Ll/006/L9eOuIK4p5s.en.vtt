00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.109 
them into water that doesn't have any
ink<00:01:16.470> as<00:01:16.710> soon<00:01:17.009> as<00:01:17.130> he<00:01:17.250> is<00:01:17.369> already<00:01:17.640> ain't<00:01:17.850> or

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
ink as soon as he is already ain't or

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.789 
ink as soon as he is already ain't or
does<00:01:18.299> it<00:01:18.330> take<00:01:18.450> a<00:01:18.630> while<00:01:18.750> from<00:01:19.110> to<00:01:19.259> regenerate

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
does it take a while from to regenerate

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.440 
does it take a while from to regenerate
oh<00:01:19.920> he<00:01:20.130> doesn't<00:01:20.340> shoot<00:01:20.610> all<00:01:20.790> his<00:01:20.909> ink<00:01:21.090> at<00:01:21.240> once

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
oh he doesn't shoot all his ink at once

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.960 
oh he doesn't shoot all his ink at once
that<00:01:22.049> would<00:01:22.229> be<00:01:22.439> counterproductive<00:01:23.340> because

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
that would be counterproductive because

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.820 
that would be counterproductive because
you'd<00:01:24.750> only<00:01:24.900> have<00:01:25.049> the<00:01:25.200> chance<00:01:25.439> to<00:01:25.530> get<00:01:25.710> away

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
you'd only have the chance to get away

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.230 
you'd only have the chance to get away
the<00:01:26.040> ones<00:01:26.220> I<00:01:28.549> suppose<00:01:29.549> it<00:01:29.759> is<00:01:29.909> theoretically

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
the ones I suppose it is theoretically

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.679 
the ones I suppose it is theoretically
possible<00:01:30.720> get<00:01:31.590> him<00:01:31.710> to<00:01:31.829> ride<00:01:32.040> out<00:01:32.189> of<00:01:32.310> it<00:01:32.689> but

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
possible get him to ride out of it but

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.499 
possible get him to ride out of it but
as<00:01:34.590> you<00:01:34.920> can<00:01:35.009> see<00:01:35.220> he's<00:01:35.460> like<00:01:35.700> really<00:01:36.000> hanging

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
as you can see he's like really hanging

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.399 
as you can see he's like really hanging
on<00:01:36.659> there<00:01:37.759> which<00:01:38.759> govern<00:01:39.090> suction<00:01:39.570> cup<00:01:39.780> this

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409

could you or his he very tasty oh very
tasty<00:03:03.650> calamari<00:03:06.260> now<00:03:07.260> they're<00:03:07.470> both<00:03:07.590> green<00:03:08.010> is

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
tasty calamari now they're both green is

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:09.949 
tasty calamari now they're both green is
that<00:03:08.670> because<00:03:08.850> of<00:03:09.030> a<00:03:09.239> reason<00:03:09.540> I<00:03:09.630> they<00:03:09.750> just

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959 
that because of a reason I they just

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:12.440 
that because of a reason I they just
naturally<00:03:10.079> green<00:03:10.530> um<00:03:11.220> they<00:03:11.730> can<00:03:11.910> change<00:03:12.209> the

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
naturally green um they can change the

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:15.259 
naturally green um they can change the
color<00:03:12.690> quite<00:03:13.019> well<00:03:13.290> so<00:03:14.040> he's<00:03:14.519> probably<00:03:14.730> green

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:15.269 
color quite well so he's probably green

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:17.449 
color quite well so he's probably green
because<00:03:15.690> he's<00:03:15.840> been<00:03:16.019> in<00:03:16.140> darkness<00:03:16.650> and<00:03:16.829> they

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:17.459 
because he's been in darkness and they

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:20.470 
because he's been in darkness and they
want<00:03:17.640> to<00:03:17.700> camouflage<00:03:18.180> so<00:03:18.959> oftentimes<00:03:19.410> you'll

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:20.480 
want to camouflage so oftentimes you'll

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:24.229 
want to camouflage so oftentimes you'll
find<00:03:21.480> them<00:03:21.720> that<00:03:21.900> they<00:03:22.850> blend<00:03:23.850> into<00:03:24.060> the

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
find them that they blend into the

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:27.620 
find them that they blend into the
background<00:03:24.269> really<00:03:25.140> really<00:03:25.470> well<00:03:26.390> like<00:03:27.390> the

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630 
background really really well like the

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:29.240 
background really really well like the
easiest<00:03:27.989> way<00:03:28.200> to<00:03:28.260> find<00:03:28.350> them<00:03:28.739> is<00:03:28.860> at<00:03:29.010> night

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
easiest way to find them is at night

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:31.190 
easiest way to find them is at night
because<00:03:29.489> they<00:03:29.880> go<00:03:30.390> out<00:03:30.510> and<00:03:30.540> they<00:03:30.750> roam<00:03:31.019> around

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 
because they go out and they roam around

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:34.640 
because they go out and they roam around
the<00:03:31.470> ocean<00:03:31.620> floor<00:03:31.950> ok<00:03:32.519> and<00:03:33.019> like<00:03:34.019> one<00:03:34.200> time<00:03:34.410> so

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
the ocean floor ok and like one time so

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:37.759 
the ocean floor ok and like one time so
