00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:53.749 
you know find their details and you know
and<00:01:48.590> yeah<00:01:49.590> I<00:01:49.680> guess<00:01:49.979> I<00:01:51.710> guess<00:01:52.710> in<00:01:52.979> some<00:01:53.579> way

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
and yeah I guess I guess in some way

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.940 
and yeah I guess I guess in some way
just<00:01:54.060> continue<00:01:54.570> to<00:01:54.630> find<00:01:54.840> a<00:01:54.899> bit<00:01:55.049> more<00:01:55.200> inside

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
just continue to find a bit more inside

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.490 
just continue to find a bit more inside
yourself<00:01:56.310> too<00:01:56.659> and<00:01:57.659> what<00:01:58.079> was<00:01:58.200> special<00:01:58.380> about

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
yourself too and what was special about

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.859 
yourself too and what was special about
that<00:01:58.649> camp<00:01:59.040> in<00:01:59.159> 2003<00:01:59.850> the<00:02:00.090> odds<00:02:00.210> he<00:02:00.390> led<00:02:00.570> up<00:02:00.719> to

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
that camp in 2003 the odds he led up to

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.380 
that camp in 2003 the odds he led up to
the<00:02:01.320> famous<00:02:01.500> win<00:02:01.860> what<00:02:02.759> was<00:02:02.880> special<00:02:03.030> at<00:02:03.240> that

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
the famous win what was special at that

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.289 
the famous win what was special at that
and<00:02:03.479> can<00:02:03.570> you<00:02:03.689> see<00:02:03.840> anything<00:02:04.079> of<00:02:04.590> that<00:02:04.700> in<00:02:05.700> this

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
and can you see anything of that in this

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.449 
and can you see anything of that in this
current<00:02:06.540> group<00:02:06.780> yeah<00:02:07.560> that<00:02:07.770> the<00:02:08.039> what<00:02:08.340> was

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
current group yeah that the what was

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:11.120 
current group yeah that the what was
best<00:02:08.640> about<00:02:08.789> the<00:02:09.000> 2003<00:02:09.569> was

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.130 
best about the 2003 was

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:14.400 
best about the 2003 was
the<00:02:12.130> togetherness<00:02:13.060> I<00:02:13.360> guess<00:02:13.600> the<00:02:14.050> the

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.410 
the togetherness I guess the the

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:16.620 
the togetherness I guess the the
momentum<00:02:14.950> the<00:02:15.130> kind<00:02:15.700> of<00:02:15.760> rolling<00:02:16.000> effective

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:16.630 
momentum the kind of rolling effective

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:19.110 
momentum the kind of rolling effective
guys<00:02:17.260> had<00:02:17.560> just<00:02:17.590> been<00:02:18.160> through<00:02:18.700> so<00:02:18.940> much

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
guys had just been through so much

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.960 
guys had just been through so much
together<00:02:19.360> learn<00:02:19.990> through<00:02:20.320> it<00:02:20.440> together<00:02:20.970> dealt

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
together learn through it together dealt

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:23.780 
together learn through it together dealt
with<00:02:22.060> the<00:02:22.210> highs<00:02:22.390> dealt<00:02:22.840> with<00:02:22.930> the<00:02:23.050> lows<00:02:23.260> and

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
with the highs dealt with the lows and

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.300 
with the highs dealt with the lows and
gained<00:02:24.790> an<00:02:24.970> understanding<00:02:25.030> as<00:02:25.720> well<00:02:25.960> of<00:02:26.310> what

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
gained an understanding as well of what

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.880 
gained an understanding as well of what
it<00:02:27.430> takes<00:02:27.730> and<00:02:28.000> and<00:02:28.240> and<00:02:28.720> kind<00:02:29.410> of<00:02:29.500> just<00:02:29.710> being

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
it takes and and and kind of just being

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:31.800 
it takes and and and kind of just being
along<00:02:30.100> the<00:02:30.220> same<00:02:30.460> path<00:02:30.730> for<00:02:31.000> so<00:02:31.180> long<00:02:31.360> I<00:02:31.570> guess

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
along the same path for so long I guess

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:34.350 
along the same path for so long I guess
always<00:02:32.620> moving<00:02:33.190> forward<00:02:33.430> and<00:02:33.700> always<00:02:33.940> trying

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 
always moving forward and always trying

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:39.150 
always moving forward and always trying
to<00:02:34.540> trying<00:02:35.170> to<00:02:36.660> push<00:02:37.660> the<00:02:37.840> bar<00:02:38.080> to<00:02:38.500> work<00:02:38.740> harder

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
to trying to push the bar to work harder

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:40.320 
to trying to push the bar to work harder
for<00:02:39.310> each<00:02:39.370> other<00:02:39.580> you<00:02:39.670> just<00:02:39.880> gained<00:02:40.060> such<00:02:40.300> a

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.330 
for each other you just gained such a

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:45.570 
for each other you just gained such a
tight<00:02:41.550> group<00:02:42.550> cohesive<00:02:43.330> group<00:02:43.630> that<00:02:44.460> that<00:02:45.460> you

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:45.580 
tight group cohesive group that that you

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:47.250 
tight group cohesive group that that you
find<00:02:45.850> that<00:02:46.000> that<00:02:46.090> momentum<00:02:46.600> is<00:02:46.750> such<00:02:46.930> that<00:02:47.110> in

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
find that that momentum is such that in

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.380 
find that that momentum is such that in
nurses<00:02:47.590> that<00:02:47.680> energy<00:02:48.040> kind<00:02:48.760> of<00:02:48.850> deals<00:02:49.090> with<00:02:49.330> a

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:49.390 
nurses that energy kind of deals with a

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:50.850 
nurses that energy kind of deals with a
lot<00:02:49.420> of<00:02:49.540> moments<00:02:49.810> for<00:02:50.140> you<00:02:50.230> on<00:02:50.350> the<00:02:50.440> field<00:02:50.680> you

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:50.860 
lot of moments for you on the field you

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:52.860 
lot of moments for you on the field you
know<00:02:50.920> when<00:02:51.160> the<00:02:51.670> games<00:02:51.910> not<00:02:52.120> going<00:02:52.180> great<00:02:52.690> and

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
know when the games not going great and

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:54.690 
know when the games not going great and
suddenly<00:02:53.350> just<00:02:53.620> that<00:02:53.800> collective<00:02:54.250> belief<00:02:54.400> and

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
suddenly just that collective belief and

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:55.560 
suddenly just that collective belief and
that<00:02:54.730> knowledge<00:02:55.000> that<00:02:55.240> you've<00:02:55.360> been<00:02:55.510> through

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:55.570 
that knowledge that you've been through

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:57.630 
that knowledge that you've been through
so<00:02:55.870> much<00:02:55.990> together<00:02:56.200> suddenly<00:02:56.560> finds<00:02:56.920> you<00:02:57.130> 5<00:02:57.340> 10

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640 
so much together suddenly finds you 5 10

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:01.050 
so much together suddenly finds you 5 10
points<00:02:57.970> here<00:02:58.090> there<00:02:58.360> and<00:02:59.640> yeah<00:03:00.640> there's<00:03:00.880> a

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060 
points here there and yeah there's a

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:04.830 
points here there and yeah there's a
huge<00:03:02.910> similarities<00:03:03.910> for<00:03:04.120> me<00:03:04.240> within<00:03:04.450> that<00:03:04.690> you

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840 
huge similarities for me within that you

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.560 
huge similarities for me within that you
know<00:03:04.930> that<00:03:05.140> the<00:03:05.610> spirit<00:03:06.610> here<00:03:06.790> in<00:03:06.880> this<00:03:07.030> group

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:07.570 
know that the spirit here in this group

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:09.510 
know that the spirit here in this group
the<00:03:07.780> way<00:03:07.960> that<00:03:08.170> guys<00:03:08.320> come<00:03:08.680> in<00:03:08.830> and<00:03:09.040> feel<00:03:09.250> part

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:09.520 
the way that guys come in and feel part

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:12.180 
the way that guys come in and feel part
of<00:03:09.610> it<00:03:09.730> at<00:03:10.030> the<00:03:10.750> way<00:03:10.900> that<00:03:11.110> you<00:03:11.470> find<00:03:11.770> the<00:03:11.980> best

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:12.190 
of it at the way that you find the best

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:14.400 
of it at the way that you find the best
out<00:03:12.430> of<00:03:12.460> each<00:03:12.580> other<00:03:12.880> around<00:03:13.090> is<00:03:13.480> around<00:03:14.110> that

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:14.410 
out of each other around is around that

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:16.620 
out of each other around is around that
the<00:03:15.040> squad<00:03:15.400> in<00:03:15.550> every<00:03:15.760> position<00:03:15.940> guys<00:03:16.390> are

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:16.630 
the squad in every position guys are

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:18.810 
the squad in every position guys are
doing<00:03:17.560> in<00:03:17.680> such<00:03:17.860> a<00:03:17.890> positive<00:03:18.130> way<00:03:18.370> you<00:03:18.580> know

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:18.820 
doing in such a positive way you know

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:21.000 
doing in such a positive way you know
it's<00:03:19.120> never<00:03:19.360> at<00:03:20.140> the<00:03:20.260> detriment<00:03:20.500> of<00:03:20.710> someone

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 
it's never at the detriment of someone

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:22.790 
it's never at the detriment of someone
else<00:03:21.160> it's<00:03:21.370> just<00:03:21.610> everyone<00:03:22.150> trying<00:03:22.390> to

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:22.800 
else it's just everyone trying to

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:25.320 
else it's just everyone trying to
somehow<00:03:23.800> pull<00:03:24.430> together<00:03:24.610> to<00:03:24.850> get<00:03:25.030> the<00:03:25.150> better

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:25.330 
somehow pull together to get the better

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:26.670 
somehow pull together to get the better
up<00:03:25.510> someone<00:03:25.870> else<00:03:25.990> to<00:03:26.140> get<00:03:26.260> the<00:03:26.320> best<00:03:26.440> out<00:03:26.650> of

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:26.680 
up someone else to get the best out of

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.800 
up someone else to get the best out of
someone<00:03:26.950> else<00:03:27.100> and<00:03:27.310> it<00:03:28.030> works<00:03:28.300> well<00:03:28.570> for<00:03:28.720> me<00:03:28.750> I

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:28.810 
someone else and it works well for me I

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:30.180 
someone else and it works well for me I
was<00:03:28.870> building<00:03:29.170> up<00:03:29.350> momentum<00:03:29.470> building<00:03:30.070> that

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:30.190 
was building up momentum building that

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:31.530 
was building up momentum building that
momentum<00:03:30.490> and<00:03:30.580> that<00:03:30.700> momentum<00:03:31.090> I<00:03:31.210> guess<00:03:31.390> is

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540 
momentum and that momentum I guess is

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:34.500 
momentum and that momentum I guess is
the<00:03:31.660> same<00:03:31.900> is<00:03:32.710> the<00:03:32.740> feeling<00:03:33.130> is<00:03:33.400> that<00:03:33.510> the

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.510 
the same is the feeling is that the

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:36.930 
the same is the feeling is that the
similarity<00:03:35.200> if<00:03:35.830> you<00:03:35.980> like<00:03:36.130> between<00:03:36.400> those<00:03:36.670> two

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:36.940 
similarity if you like between those two
