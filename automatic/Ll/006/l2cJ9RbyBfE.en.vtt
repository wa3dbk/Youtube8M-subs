00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:20.970
 And then everyone here is the movie that 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:23.039
 I wanted and now I will make a little video right 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.449
 I'm bringing a theme and for you about 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.400
 sheet music 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.930
 here is the flame of part 1 is i intend 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.720
 make other videos né to complement 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.730
 this material is a topic that has already been 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.829
 quite requested still on our channels 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.750
 the easiest keyboard I am 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.260
 finally bringing you 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:42.059
 Good then and not straight to the subject. 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:44.820
 Alphabet musicians me the right 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:49.020
 sheet music is like the expression 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:50.640
 right from our alphabet is 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.100
 important to know that this is Roberto 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.469
 of musicians is a universal language or 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.690
 be the scores here in Brazil on 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:00.780
 germany in japan they are read and 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.789
 played in exactly the same way as 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:06.180
 any language it is made right 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:09.479
 by symbols and each symbol has a sound 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.430
 there are also standards and 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:15.420
 rules so that you can perform the 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:18.180
 the score is still written 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.850
 good the main element of what 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.140
 constitutes the score is the pattern between 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.049
 other elements that we will see 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:27.090
 following the agenda it can also be 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:30.270
 called a pentagram and has that name 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:32.729
 because it consists of five lines 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:36.150
 so we have five rows and four space 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:41.070
 you can have notes on both the lines and 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:44.009
 in the good spaces when you look 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.600
 so a score you can get is 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:48.899
 you will come across some 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.930
 then the main basic elements 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:53.880
 It's not what I 'm showing in this video. 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:55.740
 are here represented in this 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:02:00.060
 figure from left to right we 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:02.130
 we then have the clave then sosthene 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:05.189
 this set of successes or 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:09.629
 can be from b boys is also the armor 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:13.260
 clef the numbers then mark the 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:13.810
 Compass is always always good, but you can 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.819
 have some 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.800
 starting note and before the measure 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:20.440
 True, so it does not have to be here. 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:23.020
 a fully filled bar is 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:26.080
 just a note a few notes to 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:28.120
 an introduction to enter the 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:30.040
 compass itself 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:33.099
 and we have the compass then it is not that 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:35.860
 you have the notes between these dividers 

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:39.640
 each divider and then mark 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:41.980
 according to the math is defined here 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:44.050
 four by four and I have not yet 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:46.450
 about it, right? 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:49.269
 on the channel and I will not try to do 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:51.069
 a video about it in the future only 

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:55.120
 For you have a notion then of what 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:56.560
 you should expect a score that 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:59.819
 I would like to leave here with you. 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:02.830
 then saying I think the most important 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:06.610
 of course 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:09.760
 the clear is very important because 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:11.739
 she defines the name of the notes, she is the one who 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:13.150
 gives name to the notes then has a 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:15.040
 example here mainly for the 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:16.769
 keyboard players, right? 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:19.720
 We're going to work, so it's just sound. 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:21.790
 and with the clef you do that is 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:23.530
 keyboardist can sometimes even escape a 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:26.170
 bit of the lighthouse camera but if you are 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:30.130
 pianist also can not escape the 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:32.709
 This is because in general 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:35.739
 in charge of the sun she is touched by the hand 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:37.090
 right and ends up farrah is touched by 

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:40.269
 left hand 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:42.850
 We'll understand the reason right now. 

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:43.989
 so I said that the key set or 

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:46.600
 note name 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:48.819
 realized that the first line and the 

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:50.620
 second row that are represented are 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:52.810
 exactly the same 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:54.760
 then we have five lines have the right 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:58.090
 drawn balls and drawings the 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:04:00.940
 graphic is exactly the same as the 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:03.430
 which differentiates the beginning here I 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:05.859
 I have sound proofing and on the underside I 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:06.940
 I have the clave de fa where I have proof. 

00:04:05.859 --> 00:04:09.280
 of Sun 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:12.280
 he is marking me here in the 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:14.620
 second row from bottom to top by 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:17.039
 is it also the starting line if it is 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:19.720
 the drawing of the class until this turn 

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:22.419
 marking which is here second line 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:26.050
 down to the top is the sun the whole ball 

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:27.370
 supported in this second line here will be 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:30.910
 the sun 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:32.770
 but it's not any sun because we have 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:34.900
 several eighths on the keyboard, then 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:35.650
 to be just a serious man a sun in 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:40.180
 August 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:45.190
 in fact this is only here the sun 4 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:46.150
 nel only referring to the 4th 4th octave there dodo 

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:48.669
 keyboard 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:53.680
 So, based on a keyboard 

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:55.270
 piano is 88 keys already finished 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:56.680
 To talk then I ended up marking this 

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:57.699
 plumper is to make a ball 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:59.440
 round trip 

00:04:57.699 --> 00:05:02.830
 So you're demonstrating that this little ball 

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:04.720
 here the fact note all supported ball 

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:08.229
 in the second line now from above to 

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:09.600
 down is going to be called pha you go 

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:12.370
 touch fa 

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:14.620
 but not any fan can be any 

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:18.370
 shape in any octave but is not 

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:22.780
 FFA is 3 or will be the third in 

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:25.090
 octave counting from the bottom up 

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:27.060
 so basically what it means in your 

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:30.280
 right hand will play sun-proof 

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:32.289
 because it is in an octave higher than I 

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:34.180
 I'm very much going to touch him or you. 

00:05:32.289 --> 00:05:36.690
 Your left hand will play for notes. 

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:39.190
 more serious so the bass clef and 

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:41.440
 just only then to the right hand 

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:44.500
 playing sharper notes 

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:46.870
 It is basically that we realize 

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:49.479
 maquiné have the notes né do ré my fa sol 

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:52.900
 There, yes, and this sequence repeats itself 

00:05:49.479 --> 00:05:55.599
 along the keyboard and I always realize the 

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:58.419
 next we have a note on line one 

00:05:55.599 --> 00:06:01.479
 in space line space and so on 

00:05:58.419 --> 00:06:04.120
 neither space nor sequential space 

00:06:01.479 --> 00:06:06.340
 or the dollar in the straight line in space 

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:08.800
 my line speak in space only in line 

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:13.530
 there in space and you will make ours 

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:16.560
 sequence for as long as you want 

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:20.490
 basically people of the staff is this 

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:23.349
 there are also some notes that are 

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:25.599
 which are placed outside the staff of 

00:06:23.349 --> 00:06:27.610
 outside the five lines are called 

00:06:25.599 --> 00:06:30.160
 supplementary notes then these notes 

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:32.710
 which are outside quotation marks on the agenda, right? 

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:35.890
 they are not really outside the agenda 

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:38.200
 because they are there but so they do not 

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:39.940
 are supported on the staff then the 

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:41.280
 people have that you will continue 

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:43.720
 following from 

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:45.220
 and to indicate then you are not in the 

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:47.680
 line is in space yourself go 

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:51.580
 draw the line and the space 

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:53.140
 so if you have the sun hakim the next 

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:56.290
 in the hotel there he will be in line 

00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:57.960
 fourth it near the hotel but will have 

00:06:56.290 --> 00:07:01.390
 a space then you do down there 

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:03.670
 Next note, you had to jump. 

00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:05.530
 a line and a space until arriving then 

00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:07.780
 You draw it like it's a 

00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:09.730
 continuation of the staff 

00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:13.420
 This applies both to 

00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:16.030
 down here are all the nomenclatures 

00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:17.710
 It's coming out really fast to you. 

00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:20.170
 you can pause the video to watch 

00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:22.420
 right name of the notes where then we 

00:07:20.170 --> 00:07:25.320
 then we have superior supplementary nodes 

00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:27.120
 and less than 

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:30.100
 nomenclature 

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:32.320
 good staff is basically this I think 

00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:33.850
 that with this material you can already 

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:39.570
 look everywhere, any and all 

00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:42.550
 thing like that and know how to name the oxen 

00:07:39.570 --> 00:07:44.860
 I recommend that you take a 

00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:47.440
 single sheet music the sina of 34 

00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:51.100
 pages and will be writing the same 

00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:52.570
 was in the examples he wrote the 

00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:54.730
 Name is from the notes 

00:07:52.570 --> 00:07:57.430
 underneath each other like this 

00:07:54.730 --> 00:07:59.740
 ball that is the this here is the sun 

00:07:57.430 --> 00:08:01.660
 think it 's the ffa and so on goes 

00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:05.590
 writing because this is a way 

00:08:01.660 --> 00:08:06.479
 of you to practice reading it is 

00:08:05.590 --> 00:08:09.130
 Schedule 

00:08:06.479 --> 00:08:12.430
 good if this video that helped me continues 

00:08:09.130 --> 00:08:14.410
 helping and also giving a favorite tanning 

00:08:12.430 --> 00:08:16.660
 share with your friends and continue 

00:08:14.410 --> 00:08:21.090
 following our channels are there 

00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:21.090
 Many thanks guys to brazil.
