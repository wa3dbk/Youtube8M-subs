standing<00:00:56.579> on<00:00:56.730> the<00:00:57.210> highest<00:00:57.539> slope<00:00:58.010> she's<00:00:59.010> a

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
standing on the highest slope she's a

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.020 
standing on the highest slope she's a
bit<00:00:59.910> taller<00:01:00.210> than<00:01:00.449> me<00:01:00.600> um<00:01:01.440> and<00:01:01.920> then<00:01:02.640> next<00:01:02.850> we

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
bit taller than me um and then next we

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.870 
bit taller than me um and then next we
have<00:01:03.210> so<00:01:03.660> pedia<00:01:04.189> she's<00:01:05.189> pretty<00:01:05.519> much<00:01:05.610> gonna<00:01:05.790> be

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
have so pedia she's pretty much gonna be

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.780 
have so pedia she's pretty much gonna be
the<00:01:06.090> tank<00:01:06.299> cuz<00:01:06.479> she<00:01:06.600> has<00:01:06.750> the<00:01:06.900> shield<00:01:07.280> I<00:01:08.280> think

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:30.330 
damn so what I'm using is UFO viewer the

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:32.480 
damn so what I'm using is UFO viewer the
followers<00:04:31.139> they<00:04:31.289> follow<00:04:31.530> each<00:04:31.830> other<00:04:32.130> and

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:32.490 
followers they follow each other and

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:36.950 
followers they follow each other and
then<00:04:32.669> that's<00:04:33.479> how<00:04:33.750> it<00:04:33.960> works<00:04:34.620> out<00:04:34.940> so<00:04:35.940> the<00:04:36.810> main

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:36.960 
then that's how it works out so the main

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:39.409 
then that's how it works out so the main
follower<00:04:37.320> that's<00:04:37.530> following<00:04:38.159> me<00:04:38.550> is<00:04:38.610> not

00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:39.419 
follower that's following me is not

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:41.210
