00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:09.190 

so<00:00:06.590> we're<00:00:06.770> in<00:00:06.859> the<00:00:06.980> crawlspace<00:00:07.450> of<00:00:08.450> this

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:09.200 
so we're in the crawlspace of this

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.650 
so we're in the crawlspace of this
property<00:00:09.799> in<00:00:09.980> about<00:00:10.190> 50<00:00:10.879> years<00:00:10.910> ago<00:00:11.180> they

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:11.660 
property in about 50 years ago they

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:13.480 
property in about 50 years ago they
dropped<00:00:11.960> the<00:00:12.080> ceiling<00:00:12.440> down<00:00:12.559> about<00:00:12.860> 18<00:00:13.280> inches

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:13.490 
dropped the ceiling down about 18 inches

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:16.150 
dropped the ceiling down about 18 inches
when<00:00:13.820> they<00:00:13.940> separated<00:00:14.509> the<00:00:14.780> property<00:00:15.290> into

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:16.160 
when they separated the property into

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:17.859 
when they separated the property into
two<00:00:16.309> units<00:00:16.730> and<00:00:16.880> you<00:00:16.970> can<00:00:17.150> see<00:00:17.360> this<00:00:17.570> is<00:00:17.750> an

00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:17.869 
two units and you can see this is an

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:21.420 
two units and you can see this is an
exterior<00:00:18.230> wall<00:00:18.680> where<00:00:19.670> they<00:00:19.820> blew<00:00:20.119> out<00:00:20.330> the

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:21.430 
exterior wall where they blew out the

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:24.310 
exterior wall where they blew out the
drywall<00:00:22.430> and<00:00:22.970> so<00:00:23.390> if<00:00:23.540> a<00:00:23.660> person<00:00:24.050> were<00:00:24.169> to

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:24.320 
drywall and so if a person were to

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:29.319 
drywall and so if a person were to
actually<00:00:24.500> start<00:00:25.009> to<00:00:25.300> fill<00:00:27.130> those<00:00:28.329> stud

00:00:29.319 --> 00:00:29.329 
actually start to fill those stud

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:31.960 
actually start to fill those stud
cavities<00:00:29.869> their<00:00:30.829> insulation<00:00:31.399> would<00:00:31.669> start

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:31.970 
cavities their insulation would start

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:38.080 
cavities their insulation would start
pushing<00:00:32.360> into<00:00:32.660> this<00:00:33.070> very<00:00:34.070> large<00:00:34.309> open<00:00:37.090> drop

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:38.090 
pushing into this very large open drop

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:40.780 
pushing into this very large open drop
ceiling<00:00:38.630> area<00:00:38.980> and<00:00:39.980> they'd<00:00:40.160> never<00:00:40.310> be<00:00:40.610> able<00:00:40.700> to

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:40.790 
ceiling area and they'd never be able to

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:43.780 
ceiling area and they'd never be able to
reach<00:00:40.970> a<00:00:41.120> dense<00:00:41.330> pack<00:00:42.250> and<00:00:43.250> they'd<00:00:43.400> waste<00:00:43.640> a

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:43.790 
reach a dense pack and they'd waste a

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:46.060 
reach a dense pack and they'd waste a
lot<00:00:43.880> of<00:00:44.030> insulation<00:00:44.510> so<00:00:45.320> what<00:00:45.560> we're<00:00:45.740> gonna<00:00:45.800> do

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:46.070 
lot of insulation so what we're gonna do

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:50.260 
lot of insulation so what we're gonna do
is<00:00:46.220> put<00:00:46.490> this<00:00:46.900> about<00:00:47.900> a<00:00:47.930> 20<00:00:48.470> foot<00:00:48.650> sock<00:00:49.270> all

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:50.270 
is put this about a 20 foot sock all

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:53.020 
is put this about a 20 foot sock all
along<00:00:50.660> the<00:00:50.840> sixty<00:00:51.320> rear<00:00:51.470> wall<00:00:51.680> and<00:00:52.670> then<00:00:52.790> fill

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:53.030 
along the sixty rear wall and then fill

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:55.360 
along the sixty rear wall and then fill
it<00:00:53.150> up<00:00:53.240> with<00:00:53.390> insulation<00:00:54.370> effectively

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:55.370 
it up with insulation effectively

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:57.490 
it up with insulation effectively
creating<00:00:55.790> a<00:00:55.910> barrier<00:00:56.150> so<00:00:56.720> when<00:00:56.840> we<00:00:56.960> dense<00:00:57.170> pack

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:57.500 
creating a barrier so when we dense pack

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:04.380 
creating a barrier so when we dense pack
the<00:00:57.680> exterior<00:00:58.160> walls<00:00:58.570> nothing<00:00:59.680> comes<00:01:00.680> out

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:04.390 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.790 

and<00:01:04.629> you<00:01:05.290> don't<00:01:05.470> have<00:01:05.620> to<00:01:05.770> hire<00:01:05.950> a<00:01:05.980> seamstress

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:07.800 
and you don't have to hire a seamstress

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:12.330 
and you don't have to hire a seamstress
any<00:01:08.800> old<00:01:09.040> sewing<00:01:09.340> machine<00:01:09.760> will<00:01:09.940> work<00:01:10.200> and<00:01:11.340> if

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:12.340 
any old sewing machine will work and if

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:13.770 
any old sewing machine will work and if
you've<00:01:12.460> never<00:01:12.610> saw<00:01:12.910> one<00:01:13.060> before<00:01:13.090> you<00:01:13.660> could

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:13.780 
you've never saw one before you could

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:15.240 
you've never saw one before you could
probably<00:01:13.990> get<00:01:14.230> a<00:01:14.260> couple<00:01:14.470> of<00:01:14.740> hints<00:01:14.920> from<00:01:15.160> a

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:15.250 
probably get a couple of hints from a

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:23.010 
probably get a couple of hints from a
friend<00:01:19.440> look<00:01:20.440> mom<00:01:20.650> no<00:01:20.950> hands<00:01:21.720> okay<00:01:22.720> what<00:01:22.900> we

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:23.020 
friend look mom no hands okay what we

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:26.010 
friend look mom no hands okay what we
have<00:01:23.050> here<00:01:23.590> is<00:01:23.830> an<00:01:24.340> old<00:01:24.490> tablecloth<00:01:25.180> but<00:01:25.750> I<00:01:25.810> got

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:26.020 
have here is an old tablecloth but I got

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:28.800 
have here is an old tablecloth but I got
from<00:01:26.229> my<00:01:26.350> mother-in-law<00:01:26.680> and<00:01:27.400> we've<00:01:27.940> folded

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:28.810 
from my mother-in-law and we've folded

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:34.760 
from my mother-in-law and we've folded
it<00:01:28.870> in<00:01:28.990> half<00:01:29.200> and<00:01:29.470> then<00:01:29.850> stitched<00:01:33.360> two<00:01:34.360> sides

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
it in half and then stitched two sides

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.350 
it in half and then stitched two sides
we're<00:01:35.770> going<00:01:35.890> to<00:01:35.950> replicate<00:01:36.369> this<00:01:36.880> and<00:01:37.240> then

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:37.360 
we're going to replicate this and then

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:41.649 
we're going to replicate this and then
stitch<00:01:37.630> them<00:01:37.660> together

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:41.659 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:44.390 

okay<00:01:42.659> so<00:01:42.720> the<00:01:43.020> entire<00:01:43.350> tube<00:01:43.680> has<00:01:43.920> been<00:01:44.130> filled

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:44.400 
okay so the entire tube has been filled

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.820 
okay so the entire tube has been filled
with<00:01:44.520> cellulose<00:01:45.150> and<00:01:46.020> it's<00:01:46.440> a<00:01:46.500> little<00:01:46.740> bit

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:46.830 
with cellulose and it's a little bit

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:49.250 
with cellulose and it's a little bit
hard<00:01:47.040> to<00:01:47.100> see<00:01:47.190> back<00:01:47.610> there<00:01:47.909> in<00:01:48.090> that<00:01:48.300> shallow

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:49.260 
hard to see back there in that shallow

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:53.719 
hard to see back there in that shallow
or<00:01:49.590> crawlspace<00:01:50.240> but<00:01:51.240> here<00:01:52.250> where<00:01:53.250> we<00:01:53.490> have<00:01:53.700> a

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
or crawlspace but here where we have a

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.170 
or crawlspace but here where we have a
diameter<00:01:54.600> of<00:01:54.840> about<00:01:54.990> 24<00:01:55.650> inches<00:01:56.180> it's

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
diameter of about 24 inches it's

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.830 
diameter of about 24 inches it's
completely<00:01:57.630> filled<00:01:57.930> and<00:01:58.290> it<00:01:58.470> goes<00:01:58.650> from<00:01:59.840> floor

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
completely filled and it goes from floor

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.620 
completely filled and it goes from floor
to<00:02:01.110> ceiling<00:02:01.320> of<00:02:02.130> the<00:02:02.369> crawl<00:02:02.700> area<00:02:03.090> here<00:02:03.330> and

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
to ceiling of the crawl area here and

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.210 
to ceiling of the crawl area here and
that's<00:02:04.050> going<00:02:04.229> to<00:02:04.290> allow<00:02:04.380> us<00:02:04.560> to<00:02:04.590> dense<00:02:04.890> pack

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:05.220 
that's going to allow us to dense pack

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:08.960 
that's going to allow us to dense pack
those<00:02:05.520> exterior<00:02:06.360> walls<00:02:06.600> and<00:02:07.020> any<00:02:07.970> material

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
those exterior walls and any material

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.669 
those exterior walls and any material
that<00:02:09.179> starts<00:02:09.600> to<00:02:09.690> move<00:02:09.810> into<00:02:10.020> this<00:02:10.170> cavity

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
that starts to move into this cavity

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:16.430 
that starts to move into this cavity
will<00:02:10.830> run<00:02:11.009> into<00:02:11.280> this<00:02:11.430> big<00:02:11.700> sock<00:02:13.430> stop
