00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:15.270 
droid razr for Verizon Wireless the
first<00:00:14.350> thing<00:00:14.500> you'll<00:00:14.620> notice<00:00:14.769> about<00:00:14.980> the

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:15.280 
first thing you'll notice about the

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:17.910 
first thing you'll notice about the
droid<00:00:15.550> razr<00:00:15.610> is<00:00:16.059> that<00:00:16.240> it<00:00:16.480> is<00:00:16.720> remarkably<00:00:17.470> thin

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:17.920 
droid razr is that it is remarkably thin

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:22.650 
droid razr is that it is remarkably thin
it<00:00:18.220> is<00:00:19.380> 7.1<00:00:20.380> millimeters<00:00:21.130> and<00:00:21.400> it<00:00:22.119> weighs<00:00:22.300> in

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:22.660 
it is 7.1 millimeters and it weighs in

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:24.990 
it is 7.1 millimeters and it weighs in
at<00:00:22.810> only<00:00:22.990> a<00:00:23.110> hundred<00:00:23.500> and<00:00:23.800> twenty<00:00:24.340> seven<00:00:24.730> grams

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:25.000 
at only a hundred and twenty seven grams

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.050 
at only a hundred and twenty seven grams
so<00:00:25.480> not<00:00:25.869> only<00:00:26.050> is<00:00:26.199> it<00:00:26.529> super<00:00:26.920> thin<00:00:27.190> but<00:00:27.760> it<00:00:27.910> is

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:28.060 
so not only is it super thin but it is

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:30.180 
so not only is it super thin but it is
super<00:00:28.449> light<00:00:28.720> on<00:00:28.960> the<00:00:29.380> back<00:00:29.560> you'll<00:00:29.830> notice

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:30.190 
super light on the back you'll notice

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:31.980 
super light on the back you'll notice
here<00:00:30.550> this<00:00:30.699> is<00:00:30.880> a<00:00:30.910> different<00:00:31.359> kind<00:00:31.480> of<00:00:31.690> backing

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:31.990 
here this is a different kind of backing

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:34.950 
here this is a different kind of backing
it<00:00:32.349> is<00:00:32.559> Kevlar<00:00:33.309> so<00:00:34.000> it's<00:00:34.449> going<00:00:34.600> to<00:00:34.660> be<00:00:34.719> very

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:34.960 
it is Kevlar so it's going to be very

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.709 
it is Kevlar so it's going to be very
resistant<00:00:35.589> to<00:00:35.649> scratches<00:00:36.219> and<00:00:36.460> you<00:00:37.420> know<00:00:37.539> what

00:00:37.709 --> 00:00:37.719 
resistant to scratches and you know what

00:00:37.719 --> 00:00:41.009 
resistant to scratches and you know what
it<00:00:37.989> looks<00:00:38.530> pretty<00:00:38.769> cool<00:00:39.120> on<00:00:40.120> the<00:00:40.359> front<00:00:40.600> it<00:00:40.809> is

00:00:41.009 --> 00:00:41.019 
it looks pretty cool on the front it is

00:00:41.019 --> 00:00:44.759 
it looks pretty cool on the front it is
a<00:00:41.429> 4.3<00:00:42.429> inch<00:00:42.609> display<00:00:43.059> it<00:00:43.329> is<00:00:43.960> Gorilla<00:00:44.319> Glass

00:00:44.759 --> 00:00:44.769 
a 4.3 inch display it is Gorilla Glass

00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:46.979 
a 4.3 inch display it is Gorilla Glass
so<00:00:45.190> this<00:00:45.370> will<00:00:45.519> also<00:00:45.940> be<00:00:46.089> very<00:00:46.359> resistant<00:00:46.960> to

00:00:46.979 --> 00:00:46.989 
so this will also be very resistant to

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:49.229 
so this will also be very resistant to
scratches<00:00:47.589> so<00:00:48.579> when<00:00:48.729> you<00:00:48.789> combine<00:00:49.059> the

00:00:49.229 --> 00:00:49.239 
scratches so when you combine the

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:51.509 
scratches so when you combine the
gorilla<00:00:49.479> glass<00:00:49.719> with<00:00:50.109> the<00:00:50.350> Kevlar<00:00:51.010> backing

00:00:51.509 --> 00:00:51.519 
gorilla glass with the Kevlar backing

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:57.660 
gorilla glass with the Kevlar backing
this<00:00:52.089> is<00:00:52.329> also<00:00:52.960> a<00:00:53.289> very<00:00:53.829> durable<00:00:54.309> phone<00:00:56.670> let's

is the old but trusting nexus one so you

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.390 
is the old but trusting nexus one so you
can<00:02:26.740> see<00:02:27.130> the<00:02:27.940> size<00:02:28.240> difference<00:02:28.270> and<00:02:29.400> also

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 
can see the size difference and also

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.880
