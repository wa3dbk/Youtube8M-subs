00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.270 
I first read the Chimera ant arc years
ago<00:00:11.759> seriously<00:00:12.509> three<00:00:12.809> years<00:00:13.080> ago<00:00:13.230> I<00:00:13.559> didn't

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
ago seriously three years ago I didn't

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.210 
ago seriously three years ago I didn't
like<00:00:14.490> it<00:00:14.670> that<00:00:15.030> much<00:00:15.059> but<00:00:15.780> it's<00:00:16.710> been<00:00:16.949> three

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
like it that much but it's been three

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.790 
like it that much but it's been three
years<00:00:17.250> so<00:00:18.029> I<00:00:18.359> definitely<00:00:19.020> want<00:00:19.380> to<00:00:19.439> like<00:00:19.650> it

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
years so I definitely want to like it

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.019 
years so I definitely want to like it
better<00:00:19.890> this<00:00:20.130> time<00:00:20.189> around<00:00:20.369> especially

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
better this time around especially

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.300 
better this time around especially
because<00:00:21.180> it's<00:00:21.810> going<00:00:21.960> to<00:00:22.020> be<00:00:22.109> animated<00:00:22.710> now<00:00:22.859> by

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
because it's going to be animated now by

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.029 
because it's going to be animated now by
madhouse<00:00:24.199> wood<00:00:25.199> and<00:00:25.439> I<00:00:25.500> think<00:00:25.769> that'll<00:00:26.010> make

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
madhouse wood and I think that'll make

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.939 
madhouse wood and I think that'll make
the<00:00:26.279> fight<00:00:26.550> significantly<00:00:27.330> better<00:00:27.570> then<00:00:28.349> when

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
the fight significantly better then when

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.859 
the fight significantly better then when
I<00:00:28.980> read<00:00:29.220> them<00:00:29.310> in<00:00:29.400> a<00:00:29.460> manga<00:00:29.730> plus<00:00:30.449> it's<00:00:30.810> been

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
sense because this arc it's promised the

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.890 
sense because this arc it's promised the
longest<00:01:16.439> hunter<00:01:16.740> on<00:01:16.860> to<00:01:17.009> arc<00:01:17.250> and<00:01:17.570> it<00:01:18.570> feels

longest hunter on to arc and it feels
like<00:01:19.020> there's<00:01:19.380> no<00:01:19.439> hope<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:20.070> answer<00:01:20.340> that

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
like there's no hope the answer that

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.210 
like there's no hope the answer that
chimera<00:01:21.090> ants<00:01:21.330> are<00:01:21.420> too<00:01:21.570> strong<00:01:21.960> and<00:01:22.259> you<00:01:23.189> can

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
chimera ants are too strong and you can

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.370 
chimera ants are too strong and you can
try<00:01:23.580> again<00:01:23.700> I<00:01:24.119> mean<00:01:24.450> you<00:01:24.780> really<00:01:24.930> need<00:01:25.110> to<00:01:25.170> try

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
try again I mean you really need to try

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.859 
try again I mean you really need to try
again<00:01:25.500> you<00:01:25.830> need<00:01:25.979> to<00:01:26.040> try<00:01:26.340> try<00:01:27.030> try<00:01:27.119> and<00:01:27.780> try

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
again you need to try try try and try

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.170 
again you need to try try try and try
again<00:01:28.259> and<00:01:28.619> again<00:01:28.770> and<00:01:29.009> again<00:01:29.460> to<00:01:29.939> beat<00:01:30.090> these

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
again and again and again to beat these

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.300 
again and again and again to beat these
motherfuckers<00:01:30.750> so<00:01:31.380> it<00:01:31.560> makes<00:01:31.740> sense<00:01:31.829> you<00:01:32.130> can

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
motherfuckers so it makes sense you can

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.120 
motherfuckers so it makes sense you can
try<00:01:32.520> again<00:01:32.640> that<00:01:33.000> fits<00:01:33.950> unfortunately<00:01:34.950> it

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
try again that fits unfortunately it

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.039 
try again that fits unfortunately it
wasn't<00:01:35.280> you<00:01:35.460> can<00:01:35.610> smile<00:01:35.909> again<00:01:36.060> and<00:01:36.509> we<00:01:36.780> didn't
