 at 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:19.340
 then dressed supposed born in 99 the goal 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:21.529

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:32.629
 the image of the activity ie 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:34.489
 ecological building actually using 

00:00:32.629 --> 00:00:36.769
 local materials and energy 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:38.660
 local for this construction so with 

00:00:36.769 --> 00:00:40.280
 essentially natural material 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:41.390
 especially at the level of insulation and 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.040
 building materials 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:44.660
 and then its heating we use the 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:47.329
 heating pad that powers 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:48.800

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.899

 which values ​​and in two products the 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.899
 left here at bhl we put in products of 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.490
 boards and other third-party products is the 

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:18.229
 part that is superior that is not 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:19.759
 marketable king combes to do 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:22.909
 of the heating pad occupies in 

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:24.229

 products that are very versatile and 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:28.490
 using many areas 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:30.470
 then there is aromatherapy and the 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:32.600
 cosmetics are now products 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:34.460

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:39.710
 at the customer level 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:41.180
 the goal always being for the company 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:42.920
 you have to create new products 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:44.810
 to innovate in the field of 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.000
 aromatherapy especially and that's right 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.920
 that our biggest one wants to say to 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.750
 carriers of innovation projects these are 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.950
 our customers allow us to go from 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:54.130
 further and further into the products 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:56.780
 that we can propose for their well-being 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:58.070
 from the start also our distillery the 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.570
 purpose was to make her discover especially 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:01.250
 to discover an activity that 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:02.990
 was new locally and so have 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:03.469
 opened the business from the start to the 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:05.030
 visit 

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:06.619
 it allowed people to pass but 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.579
 also to local people become a little 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:09.079
 little see our production 

00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:10.640
 so logically there we turn 

00:02:09.079 --> 00:02:12.320
 now on training by 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.549

 little to use essential oils 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.989
 do some preparations and then 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.850
 now we come to training 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:21.650

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:23.120
 same meaning ie from the 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.620

 distillery a store like this when we 

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:33.849
 rolls to the image in fact of our 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:36.310
 activity and the idea was to use 

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:37.690
 still the local energy of a craftsman and 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:40.330

 designed and manufactured and designed the store 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:43.750
 long that stays in the mind that 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.670
