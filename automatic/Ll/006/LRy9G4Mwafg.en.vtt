00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:08.129
 Hello everyone, today we are on a mountain 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.139
 monserrat spain 

00:00:08.129 --> 00:00:11.580
 and taking this opportunity I would give 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.049
 some tips 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:17.250
 to tourists who travels with 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:19.050
 camera to start to decide on 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.419
 set of equipment that you 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:24.509
 will take with you if you drive to 

00:00:21.419 --> 00:00:25.649
 places that are famous for their architecture and 

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:28.020
 beautiful 

00:00:25.649 --> 00:00:29.730
 architectural buildings to you 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:34.760
 need a wide angle lens 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:38.489
 I for example took the old man 40 d and 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:40.739
 wound a 2485 lens on it 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:44.249
 In principle, in the picture, it is not inferior 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:47.340
 so very much the same 2 405 

00:00:44.249 --> 00:00:49.110
 elki but considering its cheapness 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.420
 you will not mind the loan he is there 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.830
 get damaged or go with me 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.350
 took the web 

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:59.220
 but for such portraits here on crope he 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:01.200
 portrait is pretty good 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:02.720
 But in principle, this is how I decided my 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:06.320
 hardware problem 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:09.229
 I was originally going to take 2 penny and 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:12.060
 17-40 since Barcelona is full 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:13.350
 architecture and other such buildings 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.560
 which could 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:19.700
 take off but having read the internet site 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:25.320
 sniffer theft I decided not to risk 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:27.990
 such a budget set for which these 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.940
 comfortable backpack backpack tourists are not very 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.979
 I have to travel a lot 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:33.869
 move from place to place to wear with 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:37.860
 is equipment like a backpack 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:40.740
 it will be much easier I take off my 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:43.350
 photos in raw format or even raw 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.360
 + jpeg if your camera allows you 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.020
 do the same thing don't 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.810
 hesitate 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:53.509
 can even put enemies think with 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:56.179
 positions and if some very such 

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:59.580
 serious shots for example 

00:01:56.179 --> 00:02:02.399
 traveled on the same monserrat wasted 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:04.530
 money and more opportunity to come here 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:07.049
 you will have no time or 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.860
 money , then donâ€™t bet bracketing 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:10.259
 exposure 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.390
 shoot three frames one underexposed 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:14.489
 and another with normal exposure in front 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.830
 planned anyway you can then 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:20.870
 make it still gear either just 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:20.870
 choose the one you like to indulge 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.270
 cries of popular belief that 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:26.920
 bright and juicy photos can 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:29.800
 turn out only on a sunny day on 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:32.880
 actually photographed best 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:36.510
 in cloudy weather you can not bathe 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:39.220
 such hard eye shadows and 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.900
 take a whole day but if your vacation 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:43.870
 accompanied only by bright sunny 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:45.490
 take photos in the morning either in the morning or 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:47.470
 in the evening until the sun is at its zenith 

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:49.600
 get up early come to 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:55.230
 attractions first yet 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:55.230
 a group of Chinese policemen arrived 

00:02:56.079 --> 00:03:00.829
 take a tripod with you 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:02.540
 be able to photograph the night city in 

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:02.959
 second you can take a picture of yourself 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:05.659
 myself 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:09.200
 if you suddenly have to walk pro ram on 

00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:10.700
 use the rules of the composition I 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.950
 I will not go into the wilds now 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:13.970
 let's go at least by the rule 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:17.480
 golden section 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:20.870
 or what you call the rule of thirds 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:23.510
 for this, divide your frame by 9 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:25.970
 parts for this you need to spend two 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:28.970
 horizontal lines for horizontal 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:32.389
 and vertical you get a frame of 9 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:35.930
 parts here place your subject on 

00:03:32.389 --> 00:03:38.989
 intersections of these lines if you shoot 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:43.879
 frame and in your frame line falls 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:48.829
 horizon place the horizon either below 

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:50.560
 about the bottom horizontal line or top 

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:54.630
 turn horizontal 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:56.230
 but not the last look at the photo 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:58.030
 the sights of this country in 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:01.500
 which is going on the internet so you will 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:03.630
 know a better angle for shooting 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:05.580
 buy an extra battery or 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:07.740
 the flash drive will be very sad if the place on 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:10.790
 the flash drive will end or the battery will sit here 

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:10.790
 such a beautiful place 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:33.400
 following this simple rules and 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:35.199
 recommendations you can get 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:37.780
 beautiful pictures save your 

00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:39.729
 technique order and all good frames 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:42.569
 my name is Artem subscribe to the channel 

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:42.569
 bye everyone 

00:04:45.069 --> 00:04:49.099
 shooting fire is not so difficult as 

00:04:47.179 --> 00:04:51.020
 it may actually seem to you 

00:04:49.099 --> 00:04:52.729
 enough ordinary SLR or any 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:54.499
 another camera that has 

00:04:52.729 --> 00:04:56.179
 manual mode for starters come on 

00:04:54.499 --> 00:04:58.129
 let's figure out what we want to get on 

00:04:56.179 --> 00:04:59.779
 pictures do we want to freeze languages 

00:04:58.129 --> 00:05:02.149
 flames or vice versa show them 

00:04:59.779 --> 00:05:04.069
 movement as both options look 

00:05:02.149 --> 00:05:07.330
 quite effectively I will show how to shoot 

00:05:04.069 --> 00:05:07.330
 and 1 and 2
