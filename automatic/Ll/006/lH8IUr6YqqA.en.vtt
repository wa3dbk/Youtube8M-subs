00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:10.400
 well this is my 693 year 2007 

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:15.019
 to show you how to install the watch 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:16.410
 to look at the turbo psi as they want 

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:19.270
 to call 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:22.580
 this is the clock 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:25.910
 electronic if they are going to install one I would 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:29.410
 I recommend that it be electronic because 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:29.410
 the past of 

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:35.640
 of the manguerita 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:39.030
 from the engine to here inside is very hard is 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:41.190
 complicated then if they get one 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:47.030
 electronic they get it by and for 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:47.030
 $ 30 then it's much easier 

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:54.829
 and I recommend you buy this base 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:57.589
 quote because it 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:01:01.609
 It is easier for cables 

00:00:57.589 --> 00:01:04.670
 you to spend that they do not see of how 

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:07.340
 not professional then you see the 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:11.360
 cables are there back but they do not look 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:13.850
 then that tape base is good 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:18.970
 It costs like 8 dollars on ebay 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:18.970
 well then to begin 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:29.770
 where to connect the hose to the 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:33.130
 clock 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:35.690
 you have to remove this this cover from 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:38.480
 engine 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:41.890
 as you can see here I would 

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:41.890
 connect comes from here 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:55.000
 here there is the clock sensor 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:56.439
 then is this be the cost of 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.760
 intercooler in the hose of the 

00:01:56.439 --> 00:02:03.120
 intercooler is here 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:08.300
 this one that comes from down here that's going 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:08.300
 connected you cut it in half 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:11.730
 and they put the tea 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:17.880
 if you put the look and you see 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:22.350
 that is well assured that there is no 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:24.480
 air leak or anything because then no no 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:27.240
 It will give you very good not the clock not 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:31.730
 will read you very well and then what 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:35.730
 cut in half put the tf and take the 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:38.880
 clock manguerita trying to put it 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:40.940
 as a professional not, well, I 'm not 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:43.940
 a professional but try to make it 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.940
 all right 

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:54.120
 then for the clock 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:57.420
 the sensor is this the clock as they 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:59.070
 I said it is better to buy one of sensor 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:02.700
 because the only thing he has to put 

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:04.210
 between the motor and the clock is this cable 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.950
 green 

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:08.110
 the only 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:11.050
 because it's with the hose it 's very but 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:13.840
 very hard try it and really not 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:18.849
 I could then 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:20.420
 to connect the clock then take the 

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:24.780
 sensor 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:27.420
 and put the red goes on the positive 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:30.660
 and the 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:34.800
 black in the negative 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:38.150
 the one that is loose is the green that 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:38.150
 is connected to the clock 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.280
 this out 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:52.440
 I'm here 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:52.440
 of the clock 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:59.250
 in the clock 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:01.890
 what they do when they put in this base 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:04.760
 three holes have to make two 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:04.760
 to hold the
