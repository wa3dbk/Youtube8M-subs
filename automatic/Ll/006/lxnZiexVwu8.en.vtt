00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:21.610
 I'll tell you honestly I have 

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:24.130
 So never used to like piano exercises 

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:25.420
 at least not for the next one 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:28.600
 lesson in one 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:31.120
 piano teacher so I have infinite 

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:33.489
 played a lot so I have a lot 

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:34.720
 but I played what I determined 

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:35.950
 for the next lesson 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:38.530
 should play 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:39.220
 why, because I just do not enjoy it 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:42.430
 has made 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:45.210
 neither what I should practice nor that 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:47.980
 the way I was taught 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.350
 it was just c i had no fun 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:51.820
 on the thing and so on but I have 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:53.739
 I learned from this at some point 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:55.360
 really cool music teacher who has a me 

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:58.630
 few things for how tides I was 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:01.300
 totally motivates what you get 

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:04.050
 can first with little effort as well 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:06.940
 you can actually play the piano and 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:10.060
 then you can really do it 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:11.140
 can also create really good piano 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:14.229
 to be able to play 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:16.210
 and now I am exactly ten years old 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:18.549
 also a professional musician so since 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:20.320
 I live exclusively by ten years 

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:22.420
 the music i can tell you that it 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:24.640
 an indescribably beautiful feeling 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:27.250
 that you can not make a living like that 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:29.350
 can only deny but also one 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:32.229
 can lead a really good life as 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:34.510
