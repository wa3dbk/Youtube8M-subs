of<00:00:16.869> those<00:00:16.960> days<00:00:17.529> we're<00:00:17.800> at<00:00:17.890> sea<00:00:18.160> we<00:00:19.060> just<00:00:19.270> felt

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:19.570 
of those days we're at sea we just felt

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:21.480 
of those days we're at sea we just felt
with<00:00:19.750> the<00:00:19.840> convenience<00:00:20.320> of<00:00:20.410> the<00:00:20.500> package<00:00:21.009> that

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:21.490 
with the convenience of the package that

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:23.850 
with the convenience of the package that
it<00:00:21.610> would<00:00:21.730> be<00:00:21.849> good<00:00:22.210> value<00:00:22.660> for<00:00:22.689> us<00:00:23.020> normally

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:23.860 
it would be good value for us normally

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:25.200 
it would be good value for us normally
when<00:00:24.009> we<00:00:24.099> go<00:00:24.220> on<00:00:24.310> a<00:00:24.340> cruise

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:25.210 
when we go on a cruise

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:26.670 
when we go on a cruise
we'll<00:00:25.509> bring<00:00:25.720> like<00:00:25.990> a<00:00:26.020> couple<00:00:26.320> bottles<00:00:26.470> of

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:26.680 
we'll bring like a couple bottles of

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:28.830 
we'll bring like a couple bottles of
wine<00:00:26.739> on<00:00:27.099> board<00:00:27.369> and<00:00:27.700> maybe<00:00:27.820> look<00:00:28.419> for<00:00:28.630> water

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:28.840 
wine on board and maybe look for water

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:31.139

00:00:31.139 --> 00:00:31.149 
while we're in Port and this eliminated

00:00:31.149 --> 00:00:33.360 
while we're in Port and this eliminated
all<00:00:31.270> of<00:00:31.300> that<00:00:31.630> plus<00:00:32.200> again<00:00:32.739> we<00:00:32.920> just<00:00:33.130> felt<00:00:33.309> that

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:33.370 
all of that plus again we just felt that

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:41.240 
all of that plus again we just felt that
it<00:00:33.489> would<00:00:33.670> be<00:00:33.790> much<00:00:33.970> better<00:00:34.000> value<00:00:34.390> overall

00:00:58.759 --> 00:00:58.769 
packages and they're basically very

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:01.160 
packages and they're basically very
similar<00:00:59.250> it's<00:00:59.519> just<00:00:59.549> price<00:00:59.879> point<00:01:00.210> we<00:01:00.989> went

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
similar it's just price point we went

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.930 
similar it's just price point we went
with<00:01:01.260> a<00:01:01.320> premium<00:01:01.799> package<00:01:01.979> which<00:01:02.399> essentially

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
with a premium package which essentially

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.660 
with a premium package which essentially
meant<00:01:03.089> that<00:01:03.299> we<00:01:03.719> could<00:01:03.870> get<00:01:03.989> any<00:01:04.339> drink<00:01:05.339> on<00:01:05.549> the

meant that we could get any drink on the

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.899 
meant that we could get any drink on the
menu<00:01:05.700> for<00:01:06.119> less<00:01:06.299> than<00:01:06.420> $12<00:01:07.110> martinis<00:01:07.830> wine<00:01:08.399> B

menu for less than $12 martinis wine B

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.180 
menu for less than $12 martinis wine B
or<00:01:09.000> whatever<00:01:09.149> there's<00:01:10.110> another<00:01:10.380> package<00:01:10.680> that

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:11.190 
or whatever there's another package that

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:13.910 
or whatever there's another package that
is<00:01:11.369> a<00:01:11.399> maximum<00:01:11.909> of<00:01:12.030> $8<00:01:12.539> so<00:01:12.690> same<00:01:13.409> sort<00:01:13.440> of<00:01:13.740> thing

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
is a maximum of $8 so same sort of thing

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.490 
is a maximum of $8 so same sort of thing
but<00:01:14.130> basically<00:01:14.550> you're<00:01:15.119> limited<00:01:15.479> to<00:01:15.509> spending

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
but basically you're limited to spending

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:23.580 
but basically you're limited to spending
$8<00:01:16.979> per<00:01:17.009> beverage

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:23.590 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:25.530 

well<00:01:24.460> that's<00:01:24.640> the<00:01:24.759> thing<00:01:24.939> it<00:01:25.149> really<00:01:25.270> isn't

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:25.540 
well that's the thing it really isn't

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:27.510 
well that's the thing it really isn't
because<00:01:25.840> once<00:01:26.619> you<00:01:26.770> get<00:01:26.890> into<00:01:27.100> that<00:01:27.310> level

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:27.520 
because once you get into that level

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.910 
because once you get into that level
you're<00:01:28.060> pretty<00:01:28.299> much<00:01:28.479> including<00:01:29.140> everything

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:29.920 
you're pretty much including everything

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.429 
you're pretty much including everything
that<00:01:30.310> they<00:01:30.579> would<00:01:30.820> on<00:01:31.060> a<00:01:31.090> luxury<00:01:31.869> line<00:01:32.140> on<00:01:32.409> a

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:37.750 
like that you will pay a little bit

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:40.350

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:40.360 
additional same thing with celebrity if

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:42.090 
additional same thing with celebrity if
it<00:01:40.479> was<00:01:40.600> something<00:01:40.869> over<00:01:40.990> $12<00:01:41.679> we<00:01:41.830> would<00:01:42.009> have

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:42.100 
it was something over $12 we would have

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:43.800 
it was something over $12 we would have
just<00:01:42.280> paid<00:01:42.429> the<00:01:42.549> additional<00:01:43.000> amount<00:01:43.090> but

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:43.810 
just paid the additional amount but

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:45.389 
just paid the additional amount but
essentially<00:01:44.500> yes<00:01:44.679> I<00:01:44.860> mean<00:01:44.979> it<00:01:45.070> is<00:01:45.250> like

00:01:45.389 --> 00:01:45.399 
essentially yes I mean it is like

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:53.819 
essentially yes I mean it is like
traveling<00:01:45.850> on<00:01:45.939> a<00:01:45.970> six<00:01:46.210> star<00:01:46.390> cruise<00:01:46.659> line

00:01:53.819 --> 00:01:53.829 

00:01:53.829 --> 00:01:55.139 

we<00:01:54.220> were<00:01:54.340> a<00:01:54.369> little<00:01:54.430> concerned<00:01:54.850> about<00:01:55.060> that

00:01:55.139 --> 00:01:55.149 
we were a little concerned about that

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:57.539 
we were a little concerned about that
and<00:01:55.329> I<00:01:55.390> think<00:01:55.570> just<00:01:55.960> our<00:01:56.619> own<00:01:56.649> familiarity

00:01:57.539 --> 00:01:57.549 
and I think just our own familiarity

00:01:57.549 --> 00:01:59.789 
and I think just our own familiarity
with<00:01:57.640> a<00:01:57.670> package<00:01:58.119> once<00:01:59.020> we<00:01:59.140> got<00:01:59.259> understood

00:01:59.789 --> 00:01:59.799 
with a package once we got understood

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:02.039 
with a package once we got understood
the<00:01:59.890> nuance<00:02:00.280> of<00:02:00.549> how<00:02:00.670> to<00:02:00.729> order<00:02:01.090> things<00:02:01.479> was

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:02.049 
the nuance of how to order things was

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:04.080 
the nuance of how to order things was
everything<00:02:02.470> was<00:02:02.560> supplying<00:02:02.860> for<00:02:03.070> instance<00:02:03.340> we

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.090 
everything was supplying for instance we

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:05.460 
everything was supplying for instance we
were<00:02:04.240> ordering<00:02:04.509> initially<00:02:04.990> wine<00:02:05.229> by<00:02:05.439> the

with<00:02:06.490> the<00:02:06.579> package<00:02:07.000> you<00:02:07.149> ordered<00:02:07.299> by<00:02:07.539> the

with the package you ordered by the

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.330 
with the package you ordered by the
glass<00:02:07.899> so<00:02:08.229> you<00:02:08.649> know<00:02:08.739> once<00:02:08.890> we<00:02:09.039> figured<00:02:09.310> that

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340 
glass so you know once we figured that

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:12.059 
glass so you know once we figured that
out<00:02:09.519> everything<00:02:10.420> went<00:02:10.569> smoothly<00:02:10.929> and<00:02:11.319> in<00:02:11.860> fact

00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:12.069 
out everything went smoothly and in fact

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:14.070 
out everything went smoothly and in fact
I<00:02:12.250> think<00:02:12.280> we<00:02:12.819> found<00:02:13.180> that<00:02:13.360> the<00:02:13.510> service<00:02:13.900> was

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
I think we found that the service was

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.059 
I think we found that the service was
excellent

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:15.069 
excellent

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:17.220 
excellent
possibly<00:02:15.760> because<00:02:15.940> we<00:02:16.269> were<00:02:16.390> spending<00:02:16.660> more

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
possibly because we were spending more

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.050 
possibly because we were spending more
time<00:02:17.500> you<00:02:17.830> know<00:02:17.950> with<00:02:18.069> staff<00:02:18.430> and<00:02:18.700> ordering

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
time you know with staff and ordering

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.420 
time you know with staff and ordering
more<00:02:19.239> drinks<00:02:20.050> but<00:02:20.230> we<00:02:20.830> got<00:02:20.980> to<00:02:21.099> know<00:02:21.250> them

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
more drinks but we got to know them

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:24.180 
more drinks but we got to know them
better<00:02:21.580> bartenders<00:02:22.330> servers<00:02:22.660> and<00:02:23.110> in<00:02:23.980> all<00:02:24.160> I

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.190 
better bartenders servers and in all I

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:25.680 
better bartenders servers and in all I
think<00:02:24.370> it<00:02:24.550> just<00:02:24.670> made<00:02:24.880> the<00:02:24.970> experience<00:02:25.180> a<00:02:25.540> lot

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
think it just made the experience a lot

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:35.080 
think it just made the experience a lot
better

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:37.150
