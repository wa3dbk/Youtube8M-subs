thing<00:04:39.630> to<00:04:39.840> remember<00:04:40.020> is<00:04:40.530> the<00:04:40.710> size<00:04:40.919> of<00:04:41.099> the

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:41.190 
thing to remember is the size of the

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:43.279 
thing to remember is the size of the
errata<00:04:41.460> size<00:04:41.789> determines<00:04:42.570> the<00:04:42.750> size<00:04:42.990> of<00:04:43.169> your

00:04:43.279 --> 00:04:43.289 
errata size determines the size of your

00:04:43.289 --> 00:04:45.320 
errata size determines the size of your
curls<00:04:43.530> so<00:04:43.740> if<00:04:44.009> you<00:04:44.280> want<00:04:44.430> smaller<00:04:44.759> curls<00:04:45.150> go

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:45.330 
curls so if you want smaller curls go

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:46.969 
curls so if you want smaller curls go
ahead<00:04:45.479> and<00:04:45.660> use<00:04:45.750> a<00:04:45.780> smaller<00:04:46.139> rod<00:04:46.380> if<00:04:46.710> you<00:04:46.830> want

00:04:46.969 --> 00:04:46.979 
ahead and use a smaller rod if you want

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:49.219 
ahead and use a smaller rod if you want
large<00:04:47.250> voluminous<00:04:47.880> curls<00:04:48.210> then<00:04:48.599> use<00:04:48.810> bigger

00:04:49.219 --> 00:04:49.229 
large voluminous curls then use bigger

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:51.860 
large voluminous curls then use bigger
rods<00:04:49.500> I<00:04:49.740> use<00:04:50.070> about<00:04:50.280> medium<00:04:50.610> size<00:04:50.849> so<00:04:51.210> as<00:04:51.479> you

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:51.870
