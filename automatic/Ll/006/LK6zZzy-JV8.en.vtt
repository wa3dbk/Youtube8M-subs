by simply not connecting the UPS to the

power outage one

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:26.670

you<00:06:24.820> connect<00:06:25.180> some<00:06:25.390> batteries<00:06:25.810> to<00:06:26.080> it<00:06:26.230> the

00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:26.680 
you connect some batteries to it the

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:28.530 
you connect some batteries to it the
inverter<00:06:27.130> will<00:06:27.550> automatically<00:06:28.240> kick<00:06:28.480> in

therefore<00:06:29.530> you<00:06:29.770> can<00:06:29.950> use<00:06:29.980> the<00:06:30.340> UPS<00:06:30.760> as<00:06:31.030> a

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:31.090 
therefore you can use the UPS as a

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:33.930 
therefore you can use the UPS as a
general<00:06:31.660> purpose<00:06:31.930> inverter<00:06:32.680> so<00:06:33.520> what<00:06:33.700> I<00:06:33.730> did

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:33.940 
general purpose inverter so what I did

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:36.300 
general purpose inverter so what I did
was<00:06:34.750> to<00:06:34.990> take<00:06:35.200> the<00:06:35.440> uninterruptible<00:06:36.280> power

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:36.310 
was to take the uninterruptible power

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:38.820 
was to take the uninterruptible power
supply<00:06:36.970> out<00:06:37.300> of<00:06:37.360> its<00:06:37.690> old<00:06:37.900> enclosure<00:06:38.380> and

supply out of its old enclosure and

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:41.190 
supply out of its old enclosure and
build<00:06:39.340> it<00:06:39.430> into<00:06:39.550> a<00:06:39.700> new<00:06:39.910> one<00:06:40.150> where<00:06:40.600> I<00:06:40.630> had<00:06:40.960> more

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:41.200 
build it into a new one where I had more

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:43.410 
build it into a new one where I had more
space<00:06:41.530> to<00:06:42.010> add<00:06:42.160> some<00:06:42.430> connectors<00:06:43.030> and<00:06:43.330> an

space to add some connectors and an

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:45.900 
space to add some connectors and an
outlet<00:06:43.840> so<00:06:44.380> that<00:06:44.620> I<00:06:44.650> could<00:06:45.040> use<00:06:45.310> it<00:06:45.520> with<00:06:45.730> any
