how to calculate body fat percentage
your<00:00:10.500> body<00:00:10.830> fat<00:00:11.099> percentage<00:00:11.130> is<00:00:11.790> the<00:00:11.910> amount

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
your body fat percentage is the amount

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.660 
your body fat percentage is the amount
