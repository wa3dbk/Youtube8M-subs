mean<00:03:58.200> this<00:03:58.379> stuff<00:03:58.709> obviously<00:03:58.950> isn't<00:03:59.640> like

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
mean this stuff obviously isn't like

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:01.540 
mean this stuff obviously isn't like
real<00:04:00.390> diamonds<00:04:00.870> or

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:01.550 
real diamonds or

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:03.730 
real diamonds or
ever<00:04:01.700> but<00:04:02.030> the<00:04:02.270> price<00:04:02.630> of<00:04:02.870> it<00:04:03.020> I<00:04:03.260> think

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:03.740 
ever but the price of it I think

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:05.470 
ever but the price of it I think
reflects<00:04:04.370> the<00:04:04.670> quality<00:04:04.790> that<00:04:05.120> you're<00:04:05.330> gonna
