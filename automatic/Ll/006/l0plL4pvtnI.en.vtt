quality itself and that's where the

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.649 
quality itself and that's where the
opportunity<00:02:12.959> is<00:02:13.099> skin<00:02:14.099> quality<00:02:14.659> becoming

opportunity is skin quality becoming

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:21.280 
opportunity is skin quality becoming
creepy<00:02:16.310> then<00:02:18.349> related<00:02:19.349> to<00:02:19.610> problems<00:02:20.610> or

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
creepy then related to problems or

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.089 
creepy then related to problems or
exposures<00:02:22.290> i<00:02:22.470> should<00:02:22.680> say<00:02:22.920> like<00:02:23.610> sun<00:02:24.239> exposure

00:02:25.089 --> 00:02:25.099 
exposures i should say like sun exposure

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:30.140 
exposures i should say like sun exposure
smoking<00:02:26.120> stress<00:02:27.980> all<00:02:28.980> of<00:02:29.370> these<00:02:29.519> things<00:02:29.790> can

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
smoking stress all of these things can

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.240 
smoking stress all of these things can
have<00:02:30.360> an<00:02:30.480> effect<00:02:30.569> on<00:02:31.019> the<00:02:31.140> skin<00:02:31.290> quality<00:02:31.769> and

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
have an effect on the skin quality and

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.920 
have an effect on the skin quality and
can<00:02:32.790> age<00:02:33.030> the<00:02:33.840> skin<00:02:34.019> and<00:02:34.409> so<00:02:35.389> we<00:02:36.389> think<00:02:36.420> about

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
can age the skin and so we think about

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.589 
can age the skin and so we think about
eyelid<00:02:37.409> skin<00:02:37.670> realize<00:02:38.670> that<00:02:38.969> the<00:02:39.090> eyelid<00:02:39.480> skin

00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:39.599 
eyelid skin realize that the eyelid skin

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:39.920 
eyelid skin realize that the eyelid skin
is

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
is

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.050 
is
thinnest<00:02:40.290> skin<00:02:40.379> in<00:02:40.620> the<00:02:40.709> body<00:02:40.950> it's<00:02:41.609> half<00:02:41.939> a

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
thinnest skin in the body it's half a

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.199 
thinnest skin in the body it's half a
millimeter<00:02:42.540> in<00:02:42.689> thickness<00:02:42.719> and<00:02:43.519> so<00:02:44.519> anything

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
millimeter in thickness and so anything

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:47.179 
millimeter in thickness and so anything
that<00:02:45.239> breaks<00:02:45.689> down<00:02:45.900> the<00:02:46.260> collagen<00:02:46.980> in<00:02:47.129> the

00:02:47.179 --> 00:02:47.189 
that breaks down the collagen in the

00:02:47.189 --> 00:02:50.599 
that breaks down the collagen in the
skin<00:02:47.459> will<00:02:48.420> cause<00:02:48.780> the<00:02:49.230> dark<00:02:49.680> circles<00:02:49.980> the

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:50.609 
skin will cause the dark circles the

00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:54.170 
skin will cause the dark circles the
fine<00:02:50.939> lines<00:02:51.299> to<00:02:51.689> occur<00:02:52.250> now<00:02:53.250> the<00:02:53.939> other<00:02:54.060> thing

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
fine lines to occur now the other thing

00:03:09.589 --> 00:03:09.599 
fact the thing that we should also

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:12.679 
fact the thing that we should also
mention<00:03:09.959> is<00:03:10.560> when<00:03:11.069> people's<00:03:11.519> skin<00:03:11.879> a<00:03:12.150> person's

eyelid skin is almost transparent and

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:23.300 
eyelid skin is almost transparent and
you're<00:03:21.090> able<00:03:21.419> to<00:03:21.510> almost<00:03:21.659> see<00:03:21.989> through<00:03:22.439> to<00:03:23.159> the

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
you're able to almost see through to the

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:26.209 
you're able to almost see through to the
bluish<00:03:23.819> quality<00:03:24.540> of<00:03:24.989> the<00:03:25.230> or<00:03:25.469> the<00:03:25.829> reddish

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
quality the muscle underneath there so

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:31.819 
quality the muscle underneath there so
in<00:03:29.819> my<00:03:29.969> practice<00:03:30.290> one<00:03:31.290> of<00:03:31.349> the<00:03:31.469> things<00:03:31.590> that

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:31.829 
in my practice one of the things that

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:34.520 
in my practice one of the things that
we've<00:03:32.010> had<00:03:32.280> very<00:03:33.269> good<00:03:33.389> results<00:03:33.719> with<00:03:34.079> and

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
we've had very good results with and

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.050 
we've had very good results with and
again<00:03:35.159> when<00:03:35.310> we<00:03:35.400> talk<00:03:35.430> about<00:03:35.549> very<00:03:35.879> good

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
again when we talk about very good

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.629 
again when we talk about very good
results<00:03:36.450> we<00:03:36.540> don't<00:03:36.719> mean<00:03:37.280> complete<00:03:38.280> hundred

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:38.639 
results we don't mean complete hundred

00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:40.720 
results we don't mean complete hundred
percent<00:03:39.060> amazing<00:03:39.810> improvement<00:03:40.169> but

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:40.730 
percent amazing improvement but

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:43.580 
percent amazing improvement but
significant<00:03:41.730> improvement<00:03:42.450> is<00:03:42.629> with

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
significant improvement is with

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.759 
significant improvement is with
something<00:03:44.250> called<00:03:44.400> platelet-rich<00:03:44.639> plasma

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:45.769 
something called platelet-rich plasma

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:48.500 
something called platelet-rich plasma
now<00:03:46.769> platelet-rich<00:03:47.250> plasma<00:03:47.400> is<00:03:48.000> a<00:03:48.060> very

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
now platelet-rich plasma is a very

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:53.719 
now platelet-rich plasma is a very
interesting<00:03:50.959> method<00:03:51.959> that<00:03:52.560> we<00:03:52.829> employ<00:03:52.979> that's

00:03:53.719 --> 00:03:53.729 
interesting method that we employ that's

00:03:53.729 --> 00:03:56.599 
interesting method that we employ that's
been<00:03:54.209> basically<00:03:54.780> transferring<00:03:55.650> a<00:03:55.799> technology

00:03:56.599 --> 00:03:56.609 
been basically transferring a technology

00:03:56.609 --> 00:03:59.420 
been basically transferring a technology
that's<00:03:56.879> used<00:03:57.329> in<00:03:57.659> orthopedics<00:03:58.500> of<00:03:58.680> people<00:03:59.040> now

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
that's used in orthopedics of people now

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:01.460 
that's used in orthopedics of people now
more<00:03:59.729> and<00:03:59.879> more<00:03:59.970> athletes<00:04:00.299> are<00:04:00.900> going<00:04:01.260> for

more and more athletes are going for

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:04.069 
more and more athletes are going for
injections<00:04:02.129> of<00:04:02.129> platelet-rich<00:04:03.120> plasma<00:04:03.269> for

these injections well in aesthetics

00:04:11.009 --> 00:04:12.319 
these injections well in aesthetics
we've<00:04:11.220> been<00:04:11.370> using<00:04:11.579> platelet-rich<00:04:11.939> plasma

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:12.329 
we've been using platelet-rich plasma

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:15.020 
we've been using platelet-rich plasma
for<00:04:13.169> a<00:04:13.199> variety<00:04:13.470> of<00:04:13.859> things<00:04:14.189> and<00:04:14.489> what<00:04:14.819> I've

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.030 
for a variety of things and what I've

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:18.140 
for a variety of things and what I've
been<00:04:15.239> doing<00:04:15.419> is<00:04:15.959> using<00:04:16.739> it<00:04:17.070> for<00:04:17.430> under<00:04:17.880> eye

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.150 
been doing is using it for under eye

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:20.629 
been doing is using it for under eye
dark<00:04:18.570> circles<00:04:18.630> and<00:04:19.259> I've<00:04:19.799> been<00:04:19.949> consistently

00:04:20.629 --> 00:04:20.639 
dark circles and I've been consistently

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:22.820 
dark circles and I've been consistently
getting<00:04:21.000> improvement<00:04:21.989> and<00:04:22.169> that<00:04:22.590> with<00:04:22.740> the

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:22.830 
getting improvement and that with the

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:24.050 
getting improvement and that with the
concept<00:04:23.310> that<00:04:23.490> platelet<00:04:23.880> rich<00:04:24.000> plasma

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.060 
concept that platelet rich plasma

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:28.149 
concept that platelet rich plasma
there's<00:04:24.780> a<00:04:24.840> couple<00:04:25.050> of<00:04:25.199> things<00:04:25.259> one<00:04:26.190> is<00:04:26.599> it

00:04:28.149 --> 00:04:28.159 
there's a couple of things one is it

00:04:28.159 --> 00:04:31.339 
there's a couple of things one is it
stimulates<00:04:29.159> collagen<00:04:29.520> as<00:04:30.120> a<00:04:30.180> healing<00:04:30.990> process

00:04:31.339 --> 00:04:31.349 
stimulates collagen as a healing process

00:04:31.349 --> 00:04:35.300 
stimulates collagen as a healing process
and<00:04:31.979> two<00:04:32.849> it<00:04:33.210> stimulates<00:04:34.139> blood<00:04:34.740> flow<00:04:35.280> and

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:35.310 
and two it stimulates blood flow and

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:39.260 
and two it stimulates blood flow and
blood<00:04:36.060> supply<00:04:36.630> to<00:04:36.990> the<00:04:37.560> skin<00:04:38.009> so<00:04:38.550> that<00:04:38.580> results

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:39.270 
blood supply to the skin so that results

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:41.450 
blood supply to the skin so that results
in<00:04:39.389> the<00:04:39.599> skin<00:04:39.900> quality<00:04:40.229> having<00:04:40.979> a<00:04:41.130> little<00:04:41.340> bit

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:41.460 
in the skin quality having a little bit

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:44.240 
in the skin quality having a little bit
more<00:04:41.610> luster<00:04:42.229> so<00:04:43.229> these<00:04:43.710> are<00:04:43.860> the<00:04:43.889> things<00:04:44.099> that

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:44.250 
more luster so these are the things that

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:47.300 
more luster so these are the things that
that<00:04:44.759> injectables<00:04:45.479> typically<00:04:46.199> cannot<00:04:46.470> do<00:04:47.039> and

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:47.310 
that injectables typically cannot do and

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:50.060 
that injectables typically cannot do and
doing<00:04:48.150> using<00:04:48.690> platelet-rich<00:04:48.870> plasma<00:04:49.229> is<00:04:49.830> very

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:50.070 
doing using platelet-rich plasma is very

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:51.740 
doing using platelet-rich plasma is very
very<00:04:50.219> straightforward<00:04:51.029> and<00:04:51.090> our<00:04:51.210> practice

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:51.750 
very straightforward and our practice

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:53.750 
very straightforward and our practice
the<00:04:51.900> patient<00:04:52.290> comes<00:04:52.770> into<00:04:53.010> the<00:04:53.160> office<00:04:53.340> we

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:53.760 
the patient comes into the office we

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:55.220 
the patient comes into the office we
draw<00:04:54.030> blood<00:04:54.360> like<00:04:54.630> we're<00:04:54.810> doing<00:04:55.050> routine

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:55.230 
draw blood like we're doing routine

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:57.770 
draw blood like we're doing routine
blood<00:04:55.620> supply<00:04:56.010> and<00:04:56.250> then<00:04:56.850> we<00:04:57.000> spin<00:04:57.330> it<00:04:57.510> and<00:04:57.690> we

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:57.780 
blood supply and then we spin it and we

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:00.560 
blood supply and then we spin it and we
isolate<00:04:58.320> the<00:04:58.470> platelets<00:04:59.010> and<00:04:59.190> we<00:04:59.820> play<00:05:00.120> and<00:05:00.420> we

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:00.570 
isolate the platelets and we play and we

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:03.260 
isolate the platelets and we play and we
do<00:05:00.690> the<00:05:00.810> injections<00:05:01.370> so<00:05:02.370> that's<00:05:02.640> one<00:05:03.000> option

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:03.270 
do the injections so that's one option

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:05.660 
do the injections so that's one option
other<00:05:04.140> options<00:05:04.950> that<00:05:05.130> we<00:05:05.250> employ<00:05:05.640> our

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:05.670 
other options that we employ our

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:08.410 
other options that we employ our
practice<00:05:06.360> include<00:05:06.810> fractional<00:05:07.470> co2<00:05:07.710> laser

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:08.420 
practice include fractional co2 laser

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:11.390 
practice include fractional co2 laser
essentially<00:05:09.420> any<00:05:09.810> laser<00:05:10.290> which<00:05:10.800> takes<00:05:11.160> off

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:11.400 
essentially any laser which takes off

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:14.360 
essentially any laser which takes off
the<00:05:11.550> top<00:05:11.790> layer<00:05:11.820> skin<00:05:12.420> and<00:05:12.870> can<00:05:13.800> allow<00:05:14.100> new

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:14.370 
the top layer skin and can allow new

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:16.850 
the top layer skin and can allow new
collagen<00:05:15.000> and<00:05:15.120> tightening<00:05:15.630> to<00:05:15.750> occur<00:05:16.080> can

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:16.860 
collagen and tightening to occur can

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:18.760 
collagen and tightening to occur can
improve<00:05:17.310> the<00:05:17.550> appearance<00:05:17.610> of<00:05:18.090> dark<00:05:18.300> circles

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:18.770 
improve the appearance of dark circles

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:23.120 
improve the appearance of dark circles
so<00:05:20.210> otherwise<00:05:21.210> when<00:05:21.810> you<00:05:22.080> talk<00:05:22.290> about<00:05:22.320> can<00:05:22.830> ask

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:23.130 
so otherwise when you talk about can ask

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:25.580 
so otherwise when you talk about can ask
about<00:05:23.370> concealment<00:05:24.270> you're<00:05:24.870> looking<00:05:25.170> at<00:05:25.290> some

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:25.590 
about concealment you're looking at some

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:28.400 
about concealment you're looking at some
type<00:05:25.860> of<00:05:25.890> camouflage<00:05:26.880> which<00:05:27.510> is<00:05:27.750> more<00:05:28.020> in<00:05:28.260> the

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:28.410 
type of camouflage which is more in the

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:32.150 
type of camouflage which is more in the
makeup<00:05:28.770> category<00:05:29.640> or<00:05:29.930> tinted<00:05:30.930> moisturizer<00:05:31.710> to

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:32.160 
makeup category or tinted moisturizer to

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:36.650 
makeup category or tinted moisturizer to
make<00:05:32.700> the<00:05:32.910> area<00:05:33.480> look<00:05:34.110> less<00:05:34.620> dark<00:05:35.540> some<00:05:36.540> of

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:36.660 
make the area look less dark some of

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:38.870 
make the area look less dark some of
these<00:05:36.780> work<00:05:37.050> pretty<00:05:37.290> well<00:05:37.380> but<00:05:37.950> again<00:05:38.520> it<00:05:38.700> you

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:38.880 
these work pretty well but again it you

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:40.130 
these work pretty well but again it you
want<00:05:39.090> to<00:05:39.210> be<00:05:39.360> you<00:05:39.600> want<00:05:39.750> if<00:05:39.870> you're<00:05:39.960> going<00:05:40.050> to

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:40.140 
want to be you want if you're going to

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:43.760 
want to be you want if you're going to
apply<00:05:40.290> that<00:05:40.650> this<00:05:41.280> type<00:05:41.640> of<00:05:42.200> method<00:05:43.200> then

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:43.770 
apply that this type of method then

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:46.700 
apply that this type of method then
you'll<00:05:44.010> have<00:05:44.280> to<00:05:44.520> consider<00:05:44.970> where<00:05:45.930> it<00:05:46.290> goes

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:46.710 
you'll have to consider where it goes

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:48.710 
you'll have to consider where it goes
from<00:05:46.770> looking<00:05:47.400> like<00:05:47.430> it<00:05:47.820> blends<00:05:48.120> well<00:05:48.390> to

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:48.720 
from looking like it blends well to

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:50.990 
from looking like it blends well to
looking<00:05:49.140> like<00:05:49.260> it's<00:05:49.470> obviously<00:05:49.920> makeup<00:05:50.430> so

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:51.000 
looking like it's obviously makeup so

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.740 
looking like it's obviously makeup so
you<00:05:51.540> have<00:05:52.050> a<00:05:52.080> lot<00:05:52.320> of<00:05:52.350> choices<00:05:52.710> there<00:05:53.510> in<00:05:54.510> our

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:54.750 
you have a lot of choices there in our

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:57.020 
you have a lot of choices there in our
practice<00:05:54.990> I<00:05:55.440> have<00:05:55.680> a<00:05:55.710> particular<00:05:56.490> cream<00:05:56.790> that

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:57.030 
practice I have a particular cream that

00:05:57.030 --> 00:05:59.600 
practice I have a particular cream that
I<00:05:57.060> developed<00:05:57.450> called<00:05:57.900> I<00:05:58.080> rescue<00:05:58.620> that<00:05:59.190> on<00:05:59.490> the

00:05:59.600 --> 00:05:59.610 
I developed called I rescue that on the

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:02.030 
I developed called I rescue that on the
superficial<00:06:00.450> levels<00:06:00.810> of<00:06:00.930> the<00:06:00.990> skin<00:06:01.320> does

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:02.040 
superficial levels of the skin does

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:05.900 
superficial levels of the skin does
improve<00:06:02.670> the<00:06:03.410> the<00:06:04.410> the<00:06:04.770> plumpness<00:06:05.370> you<00:06:05.760> know

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:05.910 
improve the the the plumpness you know

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:08.390 
improve the the the plumpness you know
one<00:06:06.120> of<00:06:06.150> the<00:06:06.300> things<00:06:06.360> about<00:06:06.780> skin<00:06:07.770> under<00:06:08.370> the

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:08.400 
one of the things about skin under the

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:11.300 
one of the things about skin under the
eyes<00:06:08.520> that<00:06:08.940> is<00:06:09.090> very<00:06:09.450> dry<00:06:09.870> that<00:06:10.740> it<00:06:11.040> can<00:06:11.190> look

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:11.310 
eyes that is very dry that it can look

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:14.090 
eyes that is very dry that it can look
more<00:06:11.490> wrinkled<00:06:12.030> and<00:06:12.210> it<00:06:12.330> can<00:06:12.450> look<00:06:12.690> dark<00:06:13.410> so

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:14.100 
more wrinkled and it can look dark so

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:17.300 
more wrinkled and it can look dark so
what<00:06:14.760> I<00:06:14.790> came<00:06:14.970> up<00:06:15.210> with<00:06:15.630> was<00:06:15.930> a<00:06:16.310> moisturizer

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:17.310 
what I came up with was a moisturizer

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:19.970 
what I came up with was a moisturizer
there's<00:06:18.030> a<00:06:18.150> slight<00:06:18.420> tint<00:06:18.780> to<00:06:18.960> it<00:06:18.990> and<00:06:19.320> I<00:06:19.650> have

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:19.980 
there's a slight tint to it and I have

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:23.590 
there's a slight tint to it and I have
my<00:06:20.190> patients<00:06:20.700> apply<00:06:20.970> to<00:06:21.030> the<00:06:21.330> skin<00:06:22.040> daily<00:06:23.040> and

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:23.600 
my patients apply to the skin daily and

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:27.230 
my patients apply to the skin daily and
it<00:06:24.600> basically<00:06:25.260> improves<00:06:25.920> the<00:06:26.240> superficial

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:27.240 
it basically improves the superficial

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:30.020 
it basically improves the superficial
aspect<00:06:27.810> of<00:06:27.990> these<00:06:28.920> the<00:06:29.400> skin<00:06:29.640> so<00:06:29.790> I<00:06:29.820> was<00:06:29.940> like

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:30.030 
aspect of these the skin so I was like

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:32.570 
aspect of these the skin so I was like

waxing a car just smoothing out a lot of
the<00:06:32.670> irregularities<00:06:33.630> it<00:06:34.380> does<00:06:34.800> have<00:06:35.010> some

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:35.190 
the irregularities it does have some

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:37.340 
the irregularities it does have some
active<00:06:35.490> ingredients<00:06:36.090> but<00:06:36.300> really<00:06:37.140> when<00:06:37.260> you

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:37.350 
active ingredients but really when you

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:39.330 
want to build the quality of the skin

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:41.450 
want to build the quality of the skin
you<00:06:39.570> have<00:06:39.720> to<00:06:39.870> work<00:06:40.140> in<00:06:40.320> a<00:06:40.410> more<00:06:40.590> systemic<00:06:41.070> way

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:41.460 
you have to work in a more systemic way

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:45.230 
you have to work in a more systemic way
or<00:06:41.730> in<00:06:42.210> a<00:06:42.270> more<00:06:42.950> at<00:06:43.950> a<00:06:44.010> more<00:06:44.280> aggressive<00:06:44.760> way<00:06:45.180> so

00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:45.240 
or in a more at a more aggressive way so

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:48.860 
or in a more at a more aggressive way so
so<00:06:45.840> platelet-rich<00:06:46.230> plasma<00:06:46.490> has<00:06:47.490> been<00:06:47.820> what<00:06:48.690> is

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:48.870 
so platelet-rich plasma has been what is

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:52.130 
so platelet-rich plasma has been what is
our<00:06:49.110> first<00:06:49.470> go<00:06:49.860> to<00:06:50.330> treatment<00:06:51.330> for<00:06:51.750> dark
