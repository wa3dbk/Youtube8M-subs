00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:05.370
 hello voila I present to you for those 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:08.130
 who do not know the system of a 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:12.780
 Laminating Spyder Co Triangle Charm 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:16.109
 heart of 104 so here it is a case 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:19.800
 comprising of stone stone 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:22.560
 ceramic triangle or more 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:25.260
 bar work from the pond that we 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.990
 position here m in order to protect yourself from 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:32.510
 blades to avoid cutting during 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:35.489
 Sharpening two ways of working 

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:37.559
 for 30 degrees the blades at 40 Â° 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.719
 and I will show you immediately after 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.360
 so here to sharpen the knives 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:47.910
 we will just start 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:53.120
 work on the angle of the triangle in 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:55.050
 place our stones like this 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:58.500
 several knives all knives 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:01.129
 apples can be sharpened with this 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.539
 same system and there I'm toothless fear 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:06.299
 that's it but me so that I do not have 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:09.840
 large knife t I own 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:14.700
 pierval flap kitchen knife 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.240
 micro tech spider co which has a bit of 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.420
 bad to open 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.310
 So here we are ready to work 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.280
 it's really simple we start 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.740
 with the gray stones usually and 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.960
 we pass the blade of the knife so on 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:31.829
 the angle of the triangle vertically 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:34.380
 by doing down tation of not that 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:35.850
 the knife do not leave like this 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.650
 so as not to dull the tip 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:45.900
 So here we go slowly 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:47.640
 when the tac tac 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:51.540
 very slowly it is especially for the 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:02:00.100
 tip otherwise it's for that point 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:02:02.500
 and that's not good for all 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.850
 knives the same system I show you 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.990
 not the others he does not need it in 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:12.149
 more here is the kitchen knife 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:12.149
 always like this lagaffe case then points 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:23.680
 then we must have done the 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:26.380
 first step by passing the second 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:32.170
 a place in the rhine feet have 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:34.120
 worked on the dish like 106 not even 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:39.150
 system always the blade well vertical 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:39.150
 and a drawing, paying attention to the pump 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:57.570
 like week here once again work 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:03:00.150
 made with the previous stones 2-2 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:01.470
 ceramic stone then the same thing 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:06.650
 start working on the humble of the 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:10.050
 triangle tac tac 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:12.950
 this is my drawing slowly 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:12.950
 doing all their attention 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:28.769
 here is a little bit on the flat to 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:28.769
 the same one just now 

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:43.630
 here I am not long but knife 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:46.900
 will not need that next if 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:49.390
 you once have some mosses and a 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:54.070
 little rounded you have to return the 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:58.300
 tac case happened on the stones 

00:03:54.070 --> 00:04:01.270
 the flat part like this this can 

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:03.100
 walk for the winged tools by paris 

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:04.510
 carpenter tools for example the 

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:06.910
 scissors all this we can also 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:11.440
 churches and churches and that's it and for 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:13.180
 to redo adam the tip so we 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:18.550
 place the sharp knife on the 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:21.450
 above and we will move forward like these 

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:21.450
 slowly 

00:04:27.009 --> 00:04:31.210
 until their point is made again 

00:04:33.129 --> 00:04:42.490
 careful not too inclined the 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:42.490
 knife for that still remains clean 

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:48.009
 this is my point of return 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:54.879
 you have to take your time 

00:04:52.939 --> 00:04:57.080
 very good for beginners but also 

00:04:54.879 --> 00:04:59.090
 those who want a month I used it 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:02.449
 for all the collection knives of 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:06.830
 cook to others and I'm really 

00:05:02.449 --> 00:05:09.530
 satisfied lapointe and well there we can 

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:12.199
 also work the pole at the 

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:17.300
 way of the worst traditional so hop 

00:05:12.199 --> 00:05:22.430
 like this here it is really a tool 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:27.469
 perfect work where scissors he 

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:29.509
 there is a tick on the side 

00:05:27.469 --> 00:05:30.919
 go on like this and bring the chisel 

00:05:29.509 --> 00:05:33.159
 scissor intentions i'm going to catch 

00:05:30.919 --> 00:05:33.159
 a 

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:45.630
 the chisel this job I'm not going to the 

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:48.070
 to do here because I was well placed 

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:50.050
 this work like that we place it when 

00:05:48.070 --> 00:06:01.210
 even well right you must not follow too much 

00:05:50.050 --> 00:06:04.300
 the bevel and makes the pass that's it 

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:06.760
 chisel or 30 and there is no problem 

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:09.760
 for lakes 30 and so that's small 

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:13.560
 quick presentation of the spider system qu 

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:15.820
