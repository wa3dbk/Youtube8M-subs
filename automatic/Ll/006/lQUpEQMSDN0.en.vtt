00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
to trade on the web at compared to the

console and i'm going to tell you why on
the<00:00:38.820> web<00:00:39.000> app<00:00:39.180> the<00:00:39.420> weather<00:00:39.600> is<00:00:39.870> pretty<00:00:40.110> much

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
the web app the weather is pretty much

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.619 
the web app the weather is pretty much
designed<00:00:40.680> purely<00:00:41.219> for<00:00:41.910> traders<00:00:42.329> in<00:00:42.360> my

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
designed purely for traders in my

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.869 
designed purely for traders in my
opinion<00:00:42.930> the<00:00:43.230> console<00:00:44.070> is<00:00:44.309> a<00:00:44.370> lot<00:00:44.760> more

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
opinion the console is a lot more

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.389 
opinion the console is a lot more
luckier<00:00:45.360> than<00:00:45.660> the<00:00:46.020> web<00:00:46.320> app<00:00:46.500> well<00:00:46.800> it<00:00:47.039> used<00:00:47.219> to

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
luckier than the web app well it used to

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:48.920 
luckier than the web app well it used to
be<00:00:47.489> anyway<00:00:47.700> i'm<00:00:47.850> not<00:00:47.969> sure<00:00:48.149> how<00:00:48.480> it<00:00:48.629> is<00:00:48.690> at<00:00:48.840> the

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
be anyway i'm not sure how it is at the

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.990 
be anyway i'm not sure how it is at the
moment<00:00:48.989> but<00:00:49.680> it<00:00:49.739> well<00:00:49.920> is<00:00:50.219> a<00:00:50.280> lot<00:00:50.520> more<00:00:50.550> quick

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
moment but it well is a lot more quick

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.450 
moment but it well is a lot more quick
and<00:00:51.239> it's<00:00:51.570> a<00:00:51.629> lot<00:00:51.780> more<00:00:51.809> easy<00:00:52.110> to<00:00:52.379> use<00:00:52.620> and<00:00:53.070> it's

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
and it's a lot more easy to use and it's

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.400 
and it's a lot more easy to use and it's
obviously<00:00:53.969> the<00:00:54.090> console<00:00:54.570> you<00:00:55.050> get<00:00:55.260> your

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
obviously the console you get your

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.080 
obviously the console you get your
holding<00:00:55.710> a<00:00:55.770> controller<00:00:56.219> so<00:00:56.789> you're<00:00:56.910> going<00:00:57.000> to

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
holding a controller so you're going to

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.630 
holding a controller so you're going to
flick<00:00:57.360> flick<00:00:57.600> flick<00:00:57.899> however<00:00:58.559> with<00:00:59.160> an<00:00:59.340> actual

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
flick flick flick however with an actual

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.540 
flick flick flick however with an actual
web<00:00:59.879> app<00:01:00.030> using<00:01:00.449> a<00:01:00.539> cursor<00:01:01.109> in<00:01:01.289> my<00:01:01.890> opinion<00:01:02.250> a

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
web app using a cursor in my opinion a

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.020 
web app using a cursor in my opinion a
cursor<00:01:03.180> can<00:01:03.480> move<00:01:03.660> faster<00:01:03.930> than<00:01:04.830> a<00:01:04.970> whatsit<00:01:05.970> a

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
cursor can move faster than a whatsit a

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.460 
cursor can move faster than a whatsit a
joystick<00:01:06.510> I<00:01:06.720> think<00:01:06.900> that's<00:01:07.049> what's<00:01:07.260> called

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
joystick I think that's what's called

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.620 
joystick I think that's what's called
and<00:01:07.740> I<00:01:07.830> kind<00:01:08.340> of<00:01:08.460> hope<00:01:08.850> you<00:01:09.000> made<00:01:09.150> sense<00:01:09.479> I

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
and I kind of hope you made sense I

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.050 
and I kind of hope you made sense I
think<00:01:09.659> a<00:01:09.930> car<00:01:10.140> so<00:01:10.350> like<00:01:10.470> a<00:01:10.500> mouse<00:01:10.770> cursor<00:01:11.549> moves

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
think a car so like a mouse cursor moves

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.609 
think a car so like a mouse cursor moves
a<00:01:12.210> lot<00:01:12.330> quicker<00:01:12.570> and<00:01:12.930> that<00:01:13.049> could<00:01:13.229> be<00:01:13.260> that

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
a lot quicker and that could be that

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.039 
a lot quicker and that could be that
innocent<00:01:14.159> second<00:01:14.549> instance<00:01:15.090> split-second

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
innocent second instance split-second

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.499 
innocent second instance split-second

recommend<00:02:08.280> guessing<00:02:08.970> a<00:02:09.060> mouse<00:02:09.239> and<00:02:09.539> also

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
recommend guessing a mouse and also

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.229 
recommend guessing a mouse and also
using<00:02:10.289> the<00:02:10.379> webapp<00:02:10.649> obviously<00:02:11.520> the<00:02:11.849> web<00:02:12.000> up<00:02:12.120> in

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
using the webapp obviously the web up in

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:13.760 
using the webapp obviously the web up in
this<00:02:12.360> current<00:02:12.629> state<00:02:12.959> is<00:02:13.110> pretty<00:02:13.560> high

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
this current state is pretty high

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.470 
this current state is pretty high
to<00:02:13.920> use<00:02:14.100> but<00:02:14.340> I<00:02:14.400> said<00:02:14.820> that<00:02:14.970> goes<00:02:15.150> for<00:02:15.420> the

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
to use but I said that goes for the

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.990 
to use but I said that goes for the
console<00:02:15.990> as<00:02:16.140> well<00:02:16.740> but<00:02:16.980> I've<00:02:17.310> always<00:02:17.640> prefer

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
console as well but I've always prefer

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.970 
console as well but I've always prefer
using<00:02:18.180> the<00:02:18.360> well<00:02:18.510> up<00:02:18.660> it's<00:02:18.840> very<00:02:18.990> easy<00:02:19.350> very

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
using the well up it's very easy very

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.340 
using the well up it's very easy very
quick<00:02:20.460> because<00:02:20.910> my<00:02:21.150> opinion<00:02:21.510> console<00:02:21.960> it<00:02:22.140> can

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
quick because my opinion console it can

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:23.960 
quick because my opinion console it can
be<00:02:22.470> slow<00:02:22.710> and<00:02:22.950> it<00:02:23.070> can<00:02:23.190> jam<00:02:23.370> up<00:02:23.490> a<00:02:23.610> lot<00:02:23.760> more

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
be slow and it can jam up a lot more

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:25.700 
be slow and it can jam up a lot more
because<00:02:24.090> obviously<00:02:24.330> the<00:02:24.540> console<00:02:25.080> is<00:02:25.290> made

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:25.710 
because obviously the console is made

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:27.710 
because obviously the console is made
for<00:02:25.890> games<00:02:26.130> and<00:02:26.700> stuff<00:02:26.940> like<00:02:27.120> that<00:02:27.180> and<00:02:27.540> i

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
for games and stuff like that and i

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.110 
for games and stuff like that and i
believe<00:02:27.990> the<00:02:28.110> web<00:02:28.260> app<00:02:28.440> is<00:02:28.620> purely<00:02:29.250> just<00:02:29.910> made

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
believe the web app is purely just made

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.880 
believe the web app is purely just made
for<00:02:30.300> traders<00:02:30.750> and<00:02:30.990> building<00:02:31.380> squads<00:02:31.650> and

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
for traders and building squads and

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:33.440 
for traders and building squads and
stuff<00:02:32.070> like<00:02:32.220> that<00:02:32.310> so<00:02:32.460> it's<00:02:32.880> a<00:02:32.940> lot<00:02:33.060> easier<00:02:33.120> to

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
stuff like that so it's a lot easier to

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.510 
stuff like that so it's a lot easier to
use<00:02:33.750> and<00:02:33.930> that's<00:02:34.500> what<00:02:34.650> that<00:02:34.830> recommend<00:02:35.370> using

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520 
use and that's what that recommend using

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:36.980 
use and that's what that recommend using
the<00:02:35.670> well<00:02:35.820> whatever<00:02:36.300> I<00:02:36.390> know<00:02:36.600> a<00:02:36.630> lot<00:02:36.840> of<00:02:36.900> people

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:36.990 
the well whatever I know a lot of people

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:39.350 
the well whatever I know a lot of people
still<00:02:37.860> use<00:02:38.100> the<00:02:38.250> console<00:02:38.790> and<00:02:39.030> they<00:02:39.210> don't

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
still use the console and they don't

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:40.880 
still use the console and they don't
should<00:02:39.600> realize<00:02:39.990> about<00:02:40.290> the<00:02:40.410> web<00:02:40.590> app<00:02:40.740> but

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
should realize about the web app but

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:41.960 
should realize about the web app but
some<00:02:41.040> people<00:02:41.250> didn't<00:02:41.460> probably<00:02:41.820> you<00:02:41.940> know

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
some people didn't probably you know

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.480 
some people didn't probably you know
there's<00:02:42.450> a<00:02:42.540> web<00:02:42.720> app<00:02:42.870> in<00:02:43.050> my<00:02:43.170> opinion<00:02:43.500> but<00:02:44.220> I<00:02:44.280> do

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:44.490 
there's a web app in my opinion but I do

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:46.970 
there's a web app in my opinion but I do
