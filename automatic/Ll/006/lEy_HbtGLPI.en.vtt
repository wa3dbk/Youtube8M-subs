 the fact that roses took advantage of the fact that 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:48.819
 vacuum gravity mueller not 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:50.530

 the red hulk is defeated and we 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:04.810
 find out what stood behind his creation 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:06.490
 Leonard Samson and the red halki 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:08.619
 is general thadeus rouse 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:10.599
 after that the domino accidentally learns the secret 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:12.130
 personality red hulk and thanks 

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:14.349
 his ability equalizes chances 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:16.480
 domino manages to escape persecution 

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:18.160
 but doctor samson assures you to find a lady 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.959
 as with each passing hour the odds will be 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.610
 decrease for this red hulk 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:24.700
 collects a team which includes 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:26.860
 electro punisher tundra red dynamo a 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.330
 domino in turn leads the force x 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:30.069
 together with logan happens 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:31.959
 a short battle during which 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:34.060
 the red hulk team loses a 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:36.129
 once again it turns out to be blinded by claws 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:38.020
 wolverines at this moment to help him 

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:39.670
 a red hulk woman comes in 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:41.590
 assures him to go with him when to them 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:43.750
 vision comes he understands that it was 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:45.610
 a trap arranged by Samson who 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:46.690
 bought his team thanks to the tundra 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:48.130
 he manages to escape 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:49.810
 and after using electro 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:51.520
 he finds dominoes and wolverine in the house 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:53.830
 silver sable during conversation 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:55.930
 It turns out that this was all set up by Samson. 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:58.210
 and it turns out his relationship with motik 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:58.960
 In general, the red hulk was created as 

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:01.240
 antihero 

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:03.190
 and the general growth agreed to become them only 

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:05.410
 with the sole purpose of destroying bruce and 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:07.450
 the return to life of his daughter betty but 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:08.770
 common sense takes precedence over him and finding out 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:10.600
 that his daughter would be 

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:12.430
 turned into a hulk he unites 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:14.800
 together with the banner and reveal the intent 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:17.050
 fashion as which was the creation of the army 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:17.860
 red hulk of now talk about it 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:20.020
 abilities 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:22.330
 despite the fact that they are green halki 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:24.250
 looks very similar and still distinguish 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:26.080
 some features like red 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:26.620
 hulk unlike shave becomes 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:28.870
 stronger 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:31.390
 not at the expense of anger and anger but as a result 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:33.220
 gamma and cosmic energy absorption 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:35.140
 which he accumulates and may then 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:35.890
 use against your enemies but how 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:37.690
 says the load itself 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:39.670
 it's not good because it's early or 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:41.800
 late it can overheat and from cats 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:42.220
 burn besides it possesses clarity 

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:44.070
 crazy 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:46.330
 able to control their actions 

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:48.700
 use a weapon and once you even 

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:50.200
 hacked into account security system and he 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:52.210
 the only thing on the planet 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:54.190
 managed to hit the observer also in 

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:55.750
 unlike hulk with anger his eyes 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:57.400
 glow orange tint 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:59.440
 and his blood is a bit like acid 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:01.450
 on the level of physical strength he is 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:03.250
 on par with bruce but he 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:04.960
 can easily deal with a woman 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:06.970
 Hulk and women abomination 

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:09.100
 and I think that's all if you're interested 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:11.380
 then you can explore it yourself 

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:12.910
