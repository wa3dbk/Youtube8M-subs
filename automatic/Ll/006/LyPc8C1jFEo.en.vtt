00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:05.140
 to all that is good I will teach you 

00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:10.340
 what I always do to practice what 

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:12.520
 I 'm going to see, I think, not perfect 

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:15.740
 as always to practice pvp 

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:17.630
 lately the non-plastic bow nothing and 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:18.650
 the cane practically does not activate either 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:20.600
 Too much I always sing you more 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:21.890
 actively are the lighters that I 

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:24.380
 do very well for example to follow me 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:26.210
 that they liked best where it is but I 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:27.940
 I would like to be able to burn rather 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:30.699
 under the foot and without them 

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:34.390
 example live here 

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:34.390
 and I also want to practice 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:39.969
 I'll never see this, I left it 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:42.370
 running while not getting in front 

00:00:39.969 --> 00:00:44.050
 mine that does not fall on top or so that 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:45.309
 that book that I have behind is a truth 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:48.579
 that will never be exactly as it is 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:52.030
 that if you go like this and that you have a storage room 

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:53.199
 swallow I do not know exactly how this is 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:55.839
 maybe because I do not have a 

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:57.159
 naturalness and good that is a little that 

00:00:55.839 --> 00:00:59.050
 what practical practical that if you see me 

00:00:57.159 --> 00:01:01.390
 partisan with the cane and suddenly 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:03.940
 quietly something like that and we want ground 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:06.369
 and it seems that in the weather and that not only 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:07.990
 the cane valley then is one thing 

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:10.630
 quite interesting and it's done 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:12.820
 practicing with the colors to the 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:15.660
 brave controls with this well for 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:15.660
 that a player like that 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:22.770
 Ok, now yes 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:26.010
 and we are going actively then when it happens 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:30.210
 when I die to know I have not put 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:33.440
 sixth 'game' bruce kit inventor and of 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.440
 this form 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.729
 objects 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:50.520
 and they are always valid now we have forgotten 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:50.520
 but for example this year 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:57.600
 and the thing we let the fire is a 

00:01:54.179 --> 00:02:00.030
 little time over you do not have three 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:03.469
 times for example that I like that and I know that it 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.469
 He's going with his eyelashes 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:09.030
 let's see this goes for running 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:12.569
 a lot of wind as well as giving it for 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:15.349
 percent more wines especially when 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:15.349
 I want to practice a little 

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:23.620
 in the decree 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:26.470
 the seas 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:27.590
 what are we going to do get off with my very 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:30.100
 Useful 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:32.470
 what are we going to do 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:34.150
 and we died for these reasons I did not want 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:36.430
 doing as you can see when dying not that 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:39.430
 the objects or anything and this is a bit what 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:41.710
 what do i do to practice pvp when playing 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:44.260
 the games legaz is quite interesting 

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:46.630
 and entertaining where is now internet is 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.970
 as it is but this because the truth that 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:53.050
 many practices a lot talking about 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:54.460
 valÃ¨ncia lehman brothers what are they going to 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:56.290
 make your feet look like the 

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:58.920
 burnt the one who sees those feet were from 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:58.920
 sleeve wagons 

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:03.390
 like this already killing people moved 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:09.689
 and well, that will be more or less what 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:12.510
 it's always done lately just does 

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:15.090
 little the area that more or less well what 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:17.760
 I have already mastered doing it without jumping 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:20.330
 or for example as far out there are 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:23.190
 I have a little jump and I give them 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:25.950
 we have also applied those that are 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:37.829
 near them 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:37.829
 as the most 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:43.819
 now this one is not skeleton here is 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:49.939
 there is he who descended feet I 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:49.939
 I was doing for this one 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:55.890
 I did not know it has practically surrounded me 

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:58.540
 towards him and let's talk one last time 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:01.570
 and those two elements teach mature for 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:02.830
 die very easily and neither is it not 

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:05.760
 for milk I think it's 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:05.760
 practiced well 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:14.450
 is what all people that I 

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:14.450
 you ask how 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:29.000
 stone iron forgiveness not even 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:29.000
 touch others 

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:35.510
 but it will not touch 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:41.430
 the iron man any heart 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:49.690
 It is also that the tanks are a 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:54.380
 little bit more stupid 

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:57.890
 let the congress of its place 

00:04:54.380 --> 00:05:01.190
 it also follows a lot because it distracts 

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:03.900
 the blow then 

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:06.240
 to distract 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:10.099
 it's like you do not count 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:10.099
 I'm going to give you your credits 

00:05:11.479 --> 00:05:20.140
 and well, I hope you liked it 

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:24.130
 is roughly 96 as as do 

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:26.190
 I to practice this is what I used to 

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:28.870
 do and as has been said is this the 

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:33.160
 singing and used to complement it with 

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:33.670
 the with the 4 and the 5 val and in this case 

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:36.760
 americas 

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:41.290
 own complemented well 

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:43.330
 that way is also what it is with the 

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:46.639
 ale lighter to be able to burn people 

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:48.910
 under your feet or be able to burn people 

00:05:46.639 --> 00:05:50.530
 yes 

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:54.630
 no change of objects printing the day 

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:54.630
 as object change as well 

00:05:55.749 --> 00:06:04.209
 and well, I hope you liked it 

00:05:58.039 --> 00:06:04.209
 and this happens on a good day bye
