event of a thief attempting to use a
stolen<00:01:28.650> capo<00:01:29.840> eventually<00:01:30.840> we<00:01:31.140> decided<00:01:31.259> on<00:01:31.710> a

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
stolen capo eventually we decided on a

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.980 
stolen capo eventually we decided on a
simple<00:01:32.009> internal<00:01:32.880> device<00:01:33.180> that<00:01:33.840> would
