00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:50.069 
water today if you want to stock up on
some<00:00:47.770> defensive<00:00:48.250> ends<00:00:48.610> or<00:00:48.730> take<00:00:49.420> the<00:00:49.600> risk<00:00:49.870> and

00:00:50.069 --> 00:00:50.079 
some defensive ends or take the risk and

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:52.439 
some defensive ends or take the risk and
see<00:00:50.410> if<00:00:50.500> the<00:00:50.620> price<00:00:50.860> drops<00:00:50.890> again<00:00:51.370> and<00:00:51.820> buy

00:00:52.439 --> 00:00:52.449 
see if the price drops again and buy

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:54.869 
see if the price drops again and buy
them<00:00:52.660> tomorrow<00:00:52.870> but<00:00:53.320> I<00:00:53.469> feel<00:00:53.739> like<00:00:53.770> jpp<00:00:54.550> stats

00:00:54.869 --> 00:00:54.879 
them tomorrow but I feel like jpp stats

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:57.420 
them tomorrow but I feel like jpp stats
were<00:00:55.120> better<00:00:55.360> than<00:00:55.480> um<00:00:55.960> Cameron<00:00:56.649> Wake<00:00:57.039> stats

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:57.430 
were better than um Cameron Wake stats

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:59.189 
were better than um Cameron Wake stats
so<00:00:57.670> I<00:00:57.699> don't<00:00:57.910> think<00:00:58.090> they're<00:00:58.210> going<00:00:58.329> to<00:00:58.420> go<00:00:58.510> go

00:00:59.189 --> 00:00:59.199 
so I don't think they're going to go go

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:00.450 
so I don't think they're going to go go
down<00:00:59.469> in<00:00:59.680> price<00:00:59.710> I<00:01:00.070> think<00:01:00.100> they're<00:01:00.370> actually

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:00.460 
down in price I think they're actually

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:03.389 
down in price I think they're actually
go<00:01:00.789> up<00:01:00.820> but<00:01:01.719> that's<00:01:02.350> just<00:01:02.500> my<00:01:02.680> guess<00:01:02.710> take<00:01:03.280> your

00:01:03.389 --> 00:01:03.399 
go up but that's just my guess take your

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:05.100 
go up but that's just my guess take your
best<00:01:03.550> guess<00:01:03.699> of<00:01:03.850> what<00:01:04.119> you<00:01:04.270> guys<00:01:04.360> want<00:01:04.629> to<00:01:04.690> do<00:01:04.869> i

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:05.110 
best guess of what you guys want to do i

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:06.840 
best guess of what you guys want to do i
don't<00:01:05.979> think<00:01:06.190> i'm<00:01:06.310> going<00:01:06.399> to<00:01:06.520> go<00:01:06.610> ahead<00:01:06.640> and
