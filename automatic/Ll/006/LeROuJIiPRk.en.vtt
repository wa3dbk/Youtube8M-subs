them<00:00:48.390> i<00:00:48.450> think<00:00:48.539> it<00:00:48.840> was<00:00:48.930> five<00:00:49.260> one<00:00:49.730> of<00:00:50.730> five<00:00:51.270> nil

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
them i think it was five one of five nil

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.479 
them i think it was five one of five nil
i'm<00:00:51.809> not<00:00:51.960> really<00:00:52.110> sure<00:00:52.230> but<00:00:52.860> all<00:00:53.039> I<00:00:53.070> know<00:00:53.250> it

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
i'm not really sure but all I know it

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.490 
i'm not really sure but all I know it
was<00:00:53.550> it<00:00:53.940> went<00:00:54.180> really<00:00:54.539> well<00:00:54.690> and<00:00:55.079> the<00:00:55.170> reason

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
was it went really well and the reason

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.950 
was it went really well and the reason
it<00:00:55.590> went<00:00:55.680> well<00:00:55.920> is<00:00:56.820> because<00:00:57.030> we<00:00:57.300> had<00:00:57.510> the

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
it went well is because we had the

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.560

talked them we talk pretty much daily we
always<00:03:04.879> just<00:03:05.120> talked<00:03:05.329> about<00:03:05.390> random<00:03:05.540> stuff

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 
always just talked about random stuff

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:08.830 
always just talked about random stuff
and<00:03:06.349> I<00:03:07.280> don't<00:03:07.879> know<00:03:08.000> it's<00:03:08.209> just<00:03:08.390> sort<00:03:08.629> of<00:03:08.660> this

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
and I don't know it's just sort of this

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.470 
and I don't know it's just sort of this
like<00:03:09.440> close<00:03:09.980> friend<00:03:10.400> friendship<00:03:11.000> I<00:03:11.269> guess

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.480 
like close friend friendship I guess

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.600 
like close friend friendship I guess
that<00:03:12.079> really<00:03:12.560> brings<00:03:12.799> us<00:03:12.980> together<00:03:13.160> and<00:03:13.519> I

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:13.610 
that really brings us together and I

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:15.819 
that really brings us together and I
think<00:03:13.879> that<00:03:14.150> if<00:03:14.480> it<00:03:15.319> was<00:03:15.530> just<00:03:15.560> some<00:03:15.799> random

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:15.829 
think that if it was just some random

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:18.069 
think that if it was just some random

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:16.190 
requests in the past to make longer

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:17.680 
requests in the past to make longer
videos<00:05:16.460> but<00:05:16.639> would<00:05:16.820> you<00:05:16.910> be<00:05:17.030> interested<00:05:17.270> in

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:17.690 
videos but would you be interested in

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:20.439 
videos but would you be interested in
the<00:05:17.960> long<00:05:18.139> videos<00:05:18.470> as<00:05:18.680> in<00:05:19.400> the<00:05:19.789> entire<00:05:20.120> much

00:05:20.439 --> 00:05:20.449 
the long videos as in the entire much

00:05:20.449 --> 00:05:22.300 
the long videos as in the entire much
like<00:05:20.780> some<00:05:21.020> of<00:05:21.110> the<00:05:21.169> matches<00:05:21.289> I<00:05:21.740> think<00:05:22.220> the

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:22.310 
like some of the matches I think the

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:24.490 
like some of the matches I think the
time<00:05:22.520> limits<00:05:22.880> 30<00:05:23.120> minutes<00:05:23.630> so<00:05:24.169> some<00:05:24.349> of<00:05:24.380> the

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:24.500 
time limits 30 minutes so some of the

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:27.010 
time limits 30 minutes so some of the
matches<00:05:24.620> could<00:05:24.979> go<00:05:25.130> up<00:05:25.280> to<00:05:25.310> 30<00:05:25.909> minutes<00:05:26.210> but

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:27.020 
matches could go up to 30 minutes but

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:28.300 
matches could go up to 30 minutes but
would<00:05:27.349> you<00:05:27.440> be<00:05:27.530> interested<00:05:27.740> in<00:05:28.159> me

quite nicely or maybe show all the
Browns<00:05:53.060> even<00:05:53.389> if<00:05:53.479> it<00:05:53.570> goes<00:05:53.690> horribly<00:05:54.250> to<00:05:55.250> show

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:55.460 
Browns even if it goes horribly to show

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:58.089
