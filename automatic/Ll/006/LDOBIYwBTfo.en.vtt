00:00:01.379 --> 00:00:05.339
 14 

00:00:11.579 --> 00:00:13.489
 in the second level which the author 

00:00:13.489 --> 00:00:14.549
 Nassau Islands 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.460
 a picture from the field just that 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.320
 capital face same work itself on all these posts 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.420
 reconsider we always take one 

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:23.150
 motion 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:25.500
 in one country for example who got into 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:26.980
 plane 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:29.390
 with the vertical behind the position again 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:30.499
 let's see how 

00:00:30.499 --> 00:00:33.499
 that we have to go all the movements 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:36.040
 when we unfold 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:36.780
 cubit 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.900
 and you apply back 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:40.880
 and here we are talking about movement 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:43.880
 in one direction so in the other direction 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:46.250
 means what 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:49.310
 work the face of movement 

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:51.170
 already very long and hard that myself 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:52.180
 typo 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:54.400
 we even got to work 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:57.410
 four lane road 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:59.270
 suppose from myself 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:02.270
 we start to turn the white movement 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.300
 We lead Kadyrov around the circle 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.680
 so upset back 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:18.990
 the torus itself is the other side 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.990
 belan in the same way 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.250
 we are not afraid to turn around you 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:29.260
 must earn 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:30.930
 so right hand such here 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.000
 of course there are leftists exactly the same 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.860
 like the country itself 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.560
 so the other way 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.329
 the other way and turn and 

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:42.820
 will happen 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:44.970
 the law of the heat of one 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.650
 passed checks 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:49.760
 same as we twist on top 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:52.230
 but snow 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:55.230
 but in front 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.570
 left hand is exactly the same 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:01.430
 start and walker floor a little higher 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:03.720
 diploma and medal to him already shared 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:05.940
 on Monday 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.939
 on board was not understand 

00:02:08.939 --> 00:02:11.799
 above even spinning either for yourself 

00:02:11.799 --> 00:02:13.329
 either by yourself 

00:02:13.329 --> 00:02:15.049
 but you can make a pause 

00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:16.639
 stop 

00:02:16.639 --> 00:02:18.669
 whole election year like 

00:02:18.669 --> 00:02:20.789
 No cynicism 

00:02:20.789 --> 00:02:22.879
 You can also already combine 

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:25.989
 that is a bargain same dance items 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:27.829
 only one of the movements in various 

00:02:27.829 --> 00:02:29.419
 planes 

00:02:29.419 --> 00:02:31.709
 eg 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:34.069
 we do and we will get to do 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:36.849
 two circles on top here yourself in two circles 

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:39.649
 dream then move on one lap 

00:02:39.649 --> 00:02:40.769
 so let's go 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:42.369
 starting wiring 

00:02:42.369 --> 00:02:43.529
 self movement 

00:02:43.529 --> 00:02:46.529
 when it will be 

00:02:49.399 --> 00:02:50.929
 only one bear at first 

00:02:50.929 --> 00:02:52.209
 show 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:54.779
 we do 

00:02:54.779 --> 00:02:56.929
 turnover from above 

00:02:56.929 --> 00:02:59.929
 on a straight arm go down 

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:05.339
 just go to the top 

00:03:05.339 --> 00:03:05.999
 already at 2
