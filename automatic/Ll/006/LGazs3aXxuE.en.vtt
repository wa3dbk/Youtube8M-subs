hi<00:00:02.730> this<00:00:02.790> is<00:00:02.939> Todd<00:00:03.210> I<00:00:03.449> wanted<00:00:03.720> to<00:00:03.780> review<00:00:03.870> a

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:04.020 
hi this is Todd I wanted to review a

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:05.630 
hi this is Todd I wanted to review a
couple<00:00:04.230> of<00:00:04.470> methods<00:00:04.710> of<00:00:05.009> raising<00:00:05.160> butterfly

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:05.640 
couple of methods of raising butterfly

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.030 
couple of methods of raising butterfly
caterpillars<00:00:06.210> one<00:00:06.990> will<00:00:07.230> traditional<00:00:07.680> set<00:00:07.919> up

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040 
caterpillars one will traditional set up

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:09.890 
caterpillars one will traditional set up
specifically<00:00:08.460> to<00:00:08.519> place<00:00:08.820> larval<00:00:09.389> food<00:00:09.660> plant

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
specifically to place larval food plant

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.330 
specifically to place larval food plant
cuttings<00:00:10.110> and<00:00:10.440> bottled<00:00:10.710> water<00:00:10.889> as<00:00:11.070> you<00:00:11.160> see

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
cuttings and bottled water as you see

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.070 
cuttings and bottled water as you see
here<00:00:11.639> then<00:00:12.240> you<00:00:12.450> simply<00:00:12.750> place<00:00:12.960> the

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
here then you simply place the

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.600 
here then you simply place the
caterpillar<00:00:13.559> on<00:00:13.769> on<00:00:14.099> the<00:00:14.219> food<00:00:14.400> plant

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
caterpillar on on the food plant

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.670 
caterpillar on on the food plant
cuttings<00:00:14.790> this<00:00:15.750> method<00:00:16.049> works<00:00:16.230> great<00:00:16.470> for<00:00:16.500> a

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
cuttings this method works great for a

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.349 
cuttings this method works great for a
vast<00:00:16.920> majority<00:00:17.340> of<00:00:17.670> butterflies<00:00:18.090> with<00:00:18.300> a

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
vast majority of butterflies with a

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.090 
vast majority of butterflies with a
caterpillar<00:00:18.600> content<00:00:19.439> stay<00:00:19.680> on<00:00:19.740> the<00:00:19.859> plant

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
caterpillar content stay on the plant

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.670 
caterpillar content stay on the plant
after<00:00:21.029> creating<00:00:21.689> what<00:00:21.869> we<00:00:21.900> call<00:00:21.960> plant<00:00:22.500> and

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
after creating what we call plant and

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
stick but what do you do when you deal

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.350 
stick but what do you do when you deal
with<00:00:49.890> butterflies<00:00:50.399> like<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:50.730> Indra<00:00:51.090> or

birds earrings and spiders but what

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.899 
birds earrings and spiders but what
would<00:01:03.960> you<00:01:04.110> do<00:01:04.260> to<00:01:04.439> create<00:01:04.589> a<00:01:04.769> creative<00:01:05.549> setup

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
would you do to create a creative setup

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.240 
would you do to create a creative setup
for<00:01:06.060> that<00:01:06.180> scenario<00:01:06.619> here's<00:01:07.619> a<00:01:07.710> method<00:01:08.100> I've

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
for that scenario here's a method I've

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.700 
for that scenario here's a method I've
devised<00:01:08.610> called<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.119> twin<00:01:09.420> Cup<00:01:09.750> method<00:01:10.170> it's

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
devised called the twin Cup method it's

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.060 
devised called the twin Cup method it's
fairly<00:01:11.010> simple<00:01:11.659> we<00:01:12.659> have<00:01:12.810> a<00:01:12.840> lid<00:01:13.080> on<00:01:13.110> up<00:01:13.680> on<00:01:13.860> top

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
fairly simple we have a lid on up on top

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.990 
fairly simple we have a lid on up on top
with<00:01:15.000> screening<00:01:15.299> around<00:01:15.540> it<00:01:15.720> this<00:01:16.680> cup<00:01:17.400> is<00:01:17.700> a

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
with screening around it this cup is a

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.320 
with screening around it this cup is a
32<00:01:18.509> on<00:01:18.540> squad<00:01:18.900> tub<00:01:19.140> of<00:01:19.380> with<00:01:19.650> holes<00:01:20.220> drilled<00:01:20.610> in

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
32 on squad tub of with holes drilled in

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.030 
32 on squad tub of with holes drilled in
the<00:01:21.360> bottom<00:01:21.450> to<00:01:21.869> allow<00:01:21.960> plant<00:01:22.409> to<00:01:22.560> go<00:01:22.680> through

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
the bottom to allow plant to go through

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.910 
the bottom to allow plant to go through
so<00:01:23.820> if<00:01:23.939> the<00:01:24.030> plant<00:01:24.270> goes<00:01:24.450> into<00:01:24.689> the<00:01:24.810> water<00:01:25.020> but

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
so if the plant goes into the water but

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.039 
so if the plant goes into the water but
the<00:01:26.070> caterpillars<00:01:26.580> do<00:01:26.700> not<00:01:26.880> and<00:01:27.150> then<00:01:27.570> lastly

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
the caterpillars do not and then lastly

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:29.690 
the caterpillars do not and then lastly
we<00:01:28.200> have<00:01:28.380> the<00:01:28.500> cup<00:01:28.710> that<00:01:28.979> holds<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.520> water

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
we have the cup that holds the water

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.910 
we have the cup that holds the water
okay<00:01:30.420> here's<00:01:31.200> the<00:01:31.409> system<00:01:31.770> right<00:01:32.100> here<00:01:33.500> if<00:01:34.500> we

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
okay here's the system right here if we

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.890 
okay here's the system right here if we
look<00:01:35.100> down<00:01:35.130> into<00:01:35.729> the<00:01:35.970> cup<00:01:36.150> we<00:01:36.299> can<00:01:36.450> see<00:01:36.630> where

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
look down into the cup we can see where

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.179 
look down into the cup we can see where
the<00:01:36.990> where<00:01:37.350> the<00:01:37.470> caterpillar<00:01:38.040> is<00:01:40.100> and<00:01:41.100> I

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
the where the caterpillar is and I

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:42.710 
the where the caterpillar is and I
apologize<00:01:41.369> that<00:01:41.670> that<00:01:41.939> isn't<00:01:42.090> our<00:01:42.270> focusing

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
apologize that that isn't our focusing

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.870 
apologize that that isn't our focusing
the<00:01:43.259> caterpillars<00:01:43.829> on<00:01:43.950> the<00:01:44.040> plant<00:01:44.280> and<00:01:44.549> the

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
the caterpillars on the plant and the

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:45.770 
the caterpillars on the plant and the
plant<00:01:45.030> is<00:01:45.210> in<00:01:45.270> the<00:01:45.390> water

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
plant is in the water

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.889 
plant is in the water
and<00:01:45.960> the<00:01:46.380> last<00:01:46.590> step<00:01:46.909> simply<00:01:47.909> is<00:01:48.119> to<00:01:48.450> place<00:01:48.689> the

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899

allows it to do is if the caterpillar

allows it to do is if the caterpillar
cross<00:01:54.329> off<00:01:54.540> the<00:01:54.720> plant

he doesn't have far to go to find the
plant<00:01:57.420> again<00:01:57.630> making<00:01:57.869> it<00:01:58.079> much<00:01:58.170> easier<00:01:58.439> to

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
plant again making it much easier to

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.130 
plant again making it much easier to
crawl<00:01:59.520> back<00:01:59.700> on<00:01:59.850> the<00:01:59.939> plant<00:02:00.180> again<00:02:00.869> this<00:02:01.020> is

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
crawl back on the plant again this is

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.080 
crawl back on the plant again this is
one<00:02:01.290> of<00:02:01.320> several<00:02:01.439> techniques<00:02:02.070> to<00:02:02.969> address
