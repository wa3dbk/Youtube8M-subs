to that so spectator mode will be

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.800

from first person to third person this
is<00:01:15.240> going<00:01:15.360> to<00:01:15.420> help<00:01:15.600> a<00:01:15.720> lot<00:01:15.750> because<00:01:16.170> it<00:01:16.350> has

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
is going to help a lot because it has

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.950 
is going to help a lot because it has
always<00:01:16.740> been<00:01:17.100> a<00:01:17.340> little<00:01:17.610> bit<00:01:17.850> tedious<00:01:18.090> trying

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
always been a little bit tedious trying

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.289 
always been a little bit tedious trying
to<00:01:19.140> cast<00:01:19.409> during<00:01:19.979> competitive<00:01:20.670> matches<00:01:20.880> but

to cast during competitive matches but

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.210 
to cast during competitive matches but
now<00:01:21.479> that<00:01:21.689> is<00:01:21.810> completely<00:01:22.200> simplified<00:01:22.560> and<00:01:23.070> it

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
now that is completely simplified and it

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.399 
now that is completely simplified and it
is<00:01:23.340> 8,000<00:01:24.240> times<00:01:24.390> easier<00:01:24.960> because<00:01:25.140> it's

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
is 8,000 times easier because it's

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:26.840 
is 8,000 times easier because it's
actually<00:01:25.530> integrated<00:01:26.250> into<00:01:26.520> the<00:01:26.610> game

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
actually integrated into the game

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.929

assuming that you're tuning in if
there's<00:01:34.409> a<00:01:34.470> bit<00:01:34.740> of<00:01:34.770> a<00:01:35.009> delay<00:01:35.400> Holmes

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
there's a bit of a delay Holmes
