really<00:01:08.050> low<00:01:08.230> and<00:01:09.330> you<00:01:10.330> can<00:01:10.479> watch<00:01:10.630> them<00:01:10.840> grow

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:10.990 
really low and you can watch them grow

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:13.800 
really low and you can watch them grow
and<00:01:11.470> they<00:01:12.220> have<00:01:12.400> these<00:01:12.520> lids<00:01:12.939> so<00:01:13.360> it<00:01:13.509> makes<00:01:13.689> a

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:13.810 
and they have these lids so it makes a

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:15.539 
and they have these lids so it makes a
little<00:01:13.930> greenhouse<00:01:14.439> effect<00:01:14.860> inside<00:01:15.310> there

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:15.549 
little greenhouse effect inside there

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:18.060 
little greenhouse effect inside there
when<00:01:15.729> you're<00:01:15.880> starting<00:01:16.270> your<00:01:16.360> seeds<00:01:16.600> and<00:01:17.070> as

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:18.070 
when you're starting your seeds and as

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:19.969 
when you're starting your seeds and as
they<00:01:18.250> grow<00:01:18.430> you<00:01:18.490> can<00:01:18.729> keep<00:01:18.880> adding<00:01:19.060> more<00:01:19.270> soil

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
they grow you can keep adding more soil

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.490 
they grow you can keep adding more soil

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
now when you plant seeds they don't need

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.200 
now when you plant seeds they don't need
light<00:02:39.680> as<00:02:39.950> much<00:02:40.130> as<00:02:40.310> they<00:02:40.430> need<00:02:40.460> heat<00:02:40.940> when

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:41.210 
light as much as they need heat when

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:42.880 
light as much as they need heat when
they're<00:02:41.390> started<00:02:41.810> not<00:02:42.020> a<00:02:42.050> lot<00:02:42.290> of<00:02:42.320> heat<00:02:42.530> just<00:02:42.770> a

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:44.710 
they're started not a lot of heat just a
little<00:02:43.130> heat<00:02:43.340> but<00:02:43.580> until<00:02:44.510> they<00:02:44.600> actually

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.720 
little heat but until they actually

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.360 
little heat but until they actually
sprout<00:02:45.260> and<00:02:45.470> break<00:02:45.650> through<00:02:45.830> the<00:02:45.920> soil<00:02:46.160> they

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
sprout and break through the soil they

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:48.280
