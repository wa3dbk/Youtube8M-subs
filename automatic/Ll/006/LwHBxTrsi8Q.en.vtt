00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
the stitches that we'll be using the

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.710 
the stitches that we'll be using the
first<00:00:29.310> thing<00:00:29.550> you<00:00:29.670> need<00:00:29.849> to<00:00:29.910> do<00:00:30.210> is<00:00:30.390> put<00:00:30.599> your

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
first thing you need to do is put your

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.990 
first thing you need to do is put your
loop<00:00:30.960> on<00:00:31.199> your<00:00:31.230> hook<00:00:31.439> and<00:00:31.890> we're<00:00:32.550> going<00:00:32.759> to<00:00:32.820> do

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
loop on your hook and we're going to do

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.470 
loop on your hook and we're going to do
a<00:00:33.030> starting<00:00:33.540> chain<00:00:33.870> and<00:00:34.460> a<00:00:35.460> starting<00:00:35.880> chain<00:00:36.180> is

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
a starting chain and a starting chain is

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.049 
a starting chain and a starting chain is
just<00:00:36.510> yarning<00:00:37.380> over<00:00:37.559> and<00:00:37.770> pulling<00:00:38.040> the<00:00:38.820> hook

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
just yarning over and pulling the hook

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.990 
just yarning over and pulling the hook
through<00:00:39.329> the<00:00:39.360> loop<00:00:39.629> so<00:00:40.460> we<00:00:41.460> will<00:00:41.670> do<00:00:41.850> that

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
through the loop so we will do that

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.619 
through the loop so we will do that
again<00:00:42.420> and<00:00:43.910> there<00:00:44.910> are<00:00:45.000> lots<00:00:45.270> of<00:00:45.420> great

makes<00:02:06.329> a<00:02:06.450> very<00:02:06.479> tall<00:02:07.049> stitch<00:02:07.610> so<00:02:08.610> now<00:02:08.789> we'll

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
makes a very tall stitch so now we'll

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.850 
makes a very tall stitch so now we'll
get<00:02:09.149> started<00:02:09.420> I<00:02:09.810> hope<00:02:10.020> that<00:02:10.229> was<00:02:10.379> clear<00:02:10.649> for

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
get started I hope that was clear for

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.650 
get started I hope that was clear for
you<00:02:10.979> it's<00:02:11.190> kind<00:02:11.459> of<00:02:11.550> hard<00:02:11.760> to<00:02:11.879> teach<00:02:12.060> crochet

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
you it's kind of hard to teach crochet

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.580 
you it's kind of hard to teach crochet
but<00:02:13.319> I'm

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
but I'm

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.259 
but I'm
starting<00:02:13.890> out<00:02:14.010> with<00:02:14.129> the<00:02:14.250> chain<00:02:14.640> I<00:02:14.970> believe

00:02:15.259 --> 00:02:15.269 
starting out with the chain I believe

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:19.280 
starting out with the chain I believe
this<00:02:15.480> chain<00:02:15.780> I<00:02:15.810> made<00:02:16.170> 16<00:02:16.800> chains<00:02:18.110> but<00:02:19.110> it's

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
this chain I made 16 chains but it's

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.920 
this chain I made 16 chains but it's
totally<00:02:19.500> up<00:02:19.739> to<00:02:19.769> you<00:02:20.069> for<00:02:20.459> how<00:02:20.760> how<00:02:21.480> large<00:02:21.750> you

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
totally up to you for how how large you

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.110 
totally up to you for how how large you
want<00:02:21.959> your<00:02:22.200> rows<00:02:22.470> and<00:02:22.950> this<00:02:23.550> this<00:02:23.910> is<00:02:23.970> a

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
want your rows and this this is a

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.729 
want your rows and this this is a
pattern<00:02:24.390> I<00:02:24.599> just<00:02:24.810> came<00:02:24.959> up<00:02:24.989> with<00:02:25.110> on<00:02:25.349> my<00:02:25.500> own

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:25.739

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:28.610 
pattern I just came up with on my own
I<00:02:26.569> don't<00:02:27.569> know<00:02:27.750> if<00:02:27.900> it's<00:02:28.019> ever<00:02:28.140> been<00:02:28.440> done

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
I don't know if it's ever been done

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:29.990 
I don't know if it's ever been done
anywhere<00:02:28.860> before<00:02:29.129> this<00:02:29.459> is<00:02:29.640> just<00:02:29.849> my<00:02:29.970> own

00:02:32.539 --> 00:02:32.549 
pattern that I came up with to start out

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:34.580

I'm<00:02:32.790> going<00:02:33.150> to<00:02:33.269> be<00:02:33.360> doing<00:02:33.540> a<00:02:33.900> single<00:02:34.319> crochet

00:03:59.170 --> 00:03:59.180 
I've before I've done half doubles

know just if you want to make it a

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.050 
know just if you want to make it a

modify this pattern however you like but
if<00:04:07.670> you<00:04:07.819> want<00:04:08.030> it<00:04:08.150> to<00:04:08.299> be<00:04:08.450> very<00:04:08.840> uniform<00:04:09.379> and

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:09.590 
if you want it to be very uniform and

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:10.960 
if you want it to be very uniform and
you're<00:04:09.680> making<00:04:09.829> more<00:04:10.099> than<00:04:10.160> one<00:04:10.459> and<00:04:10.730> you<00:04:10.790> want

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:10.970 
you're making more than one and you want

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:12.940 
you're making more than one and you want
them<00:04:11.120> to<00:04:11.150> be<00:04:11.360> the<00:04:11.510> same<00:04:11.750> then<00:04:12.440> this<00:04:12.620> is<00:04:12.799> the

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:12.950 
them to be the same then this is the

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:15.610 
them to be the same then this is the
pattern<00:04:13.190> that<00:04:13.370> I<00:04:14.360> came<00:04:14.420> up<00:04:14.720> with<00:04:14.750> which<00:04:15.140> is<00:04:15.349> the

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:15.620 
pattern that I came up with which is the

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:18.039 
pattern that I came up with which is the
half<00:04:15.920> double<00:04:16.340> double<00:04:16.970> two<00:04:17.269> triples<00:04:17.720> and<00:04:17.930> a

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:18.049 
half double double two triples and a

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:22.270 
half double double two triples and a
double<00:04:18.410> in<00:04:18.620> each<00:04:18.859> stitch<00:04:20.650> to<00:04:21.650> keep<00:04:21.859> doing<00:04:22.130> that

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:22.280 
double in each stitch to keep doing that

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:23.860 
double in each stitch to keep doing that
all<00:04:22.460> the<00:04:22.490> way<00:04:22.639> to<00:04:22.760> the<00:04:23.000> end<00:04:23.150> and<00:04:23.539> when<00:04:23.660> you<00:04:23.750> get

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:23.870 
all the way to the end and when you get

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:27.010 
all the way to the end and when you get
to<00:04:23.960> the<00:04:24.080> end<00:04:24.289> you<00:04:24.680> also<00:04:24.970> put<00:04:25.970> in<00:04:26.210> a<00:04:26.450> slip<00:04:26.750> stitch

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:27.020 
to the end you also put in a slip stitch

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:31.360 
to the end you also put in a slip stitch
at<00:04:27.260> the<00:04:27.289> very<00:04:27.560> end<00:04:28.389> and<00:04:29.680> you<00:04:30.680> have<00:04:30.889> this<00:04:31.010> big

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:31.370 
at the very end and you have this big

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:36.190 
at the very end and you have this big
spiral<00:04:32.060> of<00:04:33.190> crochet<00:04:34.539> so<00:04:35.539> we're<00:04:35.750> going<00:04:35.840> to<00:04:35.900> tie

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:36.200 
spiral of crochet so we're going to tie

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:38.350 
spiral of crochet so we're going to tie
that<00:04:36.229> off<00:04:36.650> and<00:04:37.039> the<00:04:37.250> way<00:04:37.400> I<00:04:37.430> do<00:04:37.610> that<00:04:37.880> is<00:04:37.940> I<00:04:38.120> pull

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:38.360 
that off and the way I do that is I pull

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:41.020 
that off and the way I do that is I pull
out<00:04:38.389> the<00:04:38.660> loop<00:04:38.870> so<00:04:39.200> it's<00:04:39.349> nice<00:04:40.310> and<00:04:40.550> big<00:04:40.700> and

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:41.030 
out the loop so it's nice and big and

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:42.430 
out the loop so it's nice and big and
then<00:04:41.180> I<00:04:41.300> just<00:04:41.479> pull<00:04:41.720> the<00:04:41.840> end<00:04:41.990> of<00:04:42.110> the<00:04:42.229> yarn

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:42.440 
then I just pull the end of the yarn

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:46.330 
then I just pull the end of the yarn
through<00:04:42.710> it<00:04:43.570> and<00:04:44.570> make<00:04:44.780> a<00:04:44.810> little<00:04:45.020> knot<00:04:45.340> like

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:46.340 
through it and make a little knot like

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:49.180 
through it and make a little knot like
that<00:04:47.320> so<00:04:48.320> now<00:04:48.440> we're<00:04:48.650> going<00:04:48.800> to<00:04:48.889> start

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:49.190 
that so now we're going to start

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:54.550 
that so now we're going to start
arranging<00:04:49.550> and<00:04:51.940> spiraling<00:04:52.940> our<00:04:53.210> rows<00:04:53.500> so<00:04:54.500> I'm

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:54.560 
arranging and spiraling our rows so I'm

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:57.550 
arranging and spiraling our rows so I'm
starting<00:04:54.950> with<00:04:55.039> the<00:04:55.190> center<00:04:55.610> and<00:04:56.320> I'm<00:04:57.320> just

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:57.560 
starting with the center and I'm just

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:59.700 
starting with the center and I'm just
going<00:04:57.950> to<00:04:57.979> roll<00:04:58.460> it<00:04:58.490> the<00:04:58.729> way<00:04:58.820> that<00:04:59.000> I<00:04:59.030> want<00:04:59.360> it

00:04:59.700 --> 00:04:59.710 
going to roll it the way that I want it

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:03.400 
going to roll it the way that I want it
so<00:05:00.710> that<00:05:00.860> it<00:05:00.979> looks<00:05:01.160> like<00:05:01.340> that<00:05:01.550> and<00:05:01.880> then<00:05:02.410> I'm

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:03.410 
so that it looks like that and then I'm

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:05.469 
so that it looks like that and then I'm
taking<00:05:03.680> this<00:05:04.070> plastic<00:05:04.580> needle<00:05:04.970> with<00:05:05.150> a<00:05:05.180> large

00:05:05.469 --> 00:05:05.479 
taking this plastic needle with a large

00:05:05.479 --> 00:05:08.020 
taking this plastic needle with a large
head<00:05:05.750> that<00:05:06.590> yarn<00:05:06.860> can<00:05:07.039> fit<00:05:07.280> through<00:05:07.550> and<00:05:07.820> I'm

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:08.030 
head that yarn can fit through and I'm

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:11.440 
head that yarn can fit through and I'm
just<00:05:08.270> going<00:05:08.479> to<00:05:08.979> tack<00:05:09.979> the<00:05:10.310> rows<00:05:10.550> in<00:05:11.090> a<00:05:11.270> few

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:11.450 
just going to tack the rows in a few

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:16.480 
just going to tack the rows in a few
places<00:05:11.570> so<00:05:12.349> that<00:05:12.620> it<00:05:13.520> stays<00:05:13.880> together<00:05:15.490> I'm

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:16.490 
places so that it stays together I'm

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:18.010 
places so that it stays together I'm
coming<00:05:16.849> up<00:05:16.970> through<00:05:17.120> the<00:05:17.240> center<00:05:17.660> and<00:05:17.960> that

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:18.020 
coming up through the center and that

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:19.870 
coming up through the center and that
also<00:05:18.380> helps<00:05:18.830> give<00:05:18.979> the<00:05:19.010> center<00:05:19.400> a<00:05:19.430> little<00:05:19.610> more

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:19.880 
also helps give the center a little more

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:23.620 
also helps give the center a little more
definition<00:05:20.060> and<00:05:21.729> then<00:05:22.729> I'll<00:05:22.849> just<00:05:23.030> be<00:05:23.120> tacking

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:23.630 
definition and then I'll just be tacking

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:25.990 
definition and then I'll just be tacking
it<00:05:23.750> in<00:05:23.900> a<00:05:23.960> few<00:05:24.229> additional<00:05:25.070> places<00:05:25.550> just<00:05:25.789> to

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:26.000 
it in a few additional places just to

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:33.110 
it in a few additional places just to
keep<00:05:26.150> it<00:05:26.330> secure

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:33.120 

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:36.059 

for<00:05:34.120> this<00:05:34.240> rose<00:05:34.539> the<00:05:34.780> back<00:05:34.960> doesn't<00:05:35.259> show<00:05:35.680> so

00:05:36.059 --> 00:05:36.069 
for this rose the back doesn't show so

00:05:36.069 --> 00:05:38.010 
for this rose the back doesn't show so
I'm<00:05:36.310> just<00:05:36.580> tying<00:05:36.849> a<00:05:37.030> knot<00:05:37.150> in<00:05:37.419> the<00:05:37.449> back<00:05:37.719> and

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:38.020 
I'm just tying a knot in the back and

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:40.800 
I'm just tying a knot in the back and
we'll<00:05:38.110> be<00:05:38.169> covering<00:05:38.469> that<00:05:38.680> up<00:05:38.979> later<00:05:39.300> so<00:05:40.300> for

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:40.810 
we'll be covering that up later so for

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:42.959 
we'll be covering that up later so for
the<00:05:40.990> leaf<00:05:41.319> this<00:05:41.830> is<00:05:42.009> another<00:05:42.280> pattern<00:05:42.580> that<00:05:42.879> I

00:05:42.959 --> 00:05:42.969 
the leaf this is another pattern that I

00:05:42.969 --> 00:05:43.559 
the leaf this is another pattern that I
came<00:05:43.030> up<00:05:43.240> with

00:05:43.559 --> 00:05:43.569 
came up with

00:05:43.569 --> 00:05:46.679 
came up with
I<00:05:43.810> am<00:05:43.990> chaining<00:05:44.560> eight<00:05:45.240> there<00:05:46.240> are<00:05:46.330> lots<00:05:46.569> of

00:05:46.679 --> 00:05:46.689 
I am chaining eight there are lots of

00:05:46.689 --> 00:05:48.540 
I am chaining eight there are lots of
ways<00:05:46.840> to<00:05:47.110> do<00:05:47.229> leaves<00:05:47.530> ambrose's<00:05:48.310> so

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:48.550 
ways to do leaves ambrose's so

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:50.490 
ways to do leaves ambrose's so
definitely<00:05:48.969> google<00:05:49.479> that<00:05:49.599> and<00:05:49.659> look<00:05:49.930> into<00:05:50.319> it

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:50.500 
definitely google that and look into it

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:53.159 
definitely google that and look into it
but<00:05:51.039> for<00:05:51.099> mine<00:05:51.490> I<00:05:51.819> am<00:05:51.849> going<00:05:52.240> to<00:05:52.419> do<00:05:52.569> a<00:05:52.599> single

00:05:53.159 --> 00:05:53.169 
but for mine I am going to do a single

00:05:53.169 --> 00:05:55.320 
but for mine I am going to do a single
crochet<00:05:53.500> in<00:05:54.159> the<00:05:54.340> second<00:05:54.819> chain<00:05:54.879> from<00:05:55.060> the

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:55.330 
crochet in the second chain from the

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:58.529 
crochet in the second chain from the
hook<00:05:55.449> in<00:05:56.460> the<00:05:57.460> next<00:05:57.490> stitch<00:05:57.789> I<00:05:58.120> will<00:05:58.150> be<00:05:58.389> doing

00:05:58.529 --> 00:05:58.539 
hook in the next stitch I will be doing

00:05:58.539 --> 00:06:01.140 
hook in the next stitch I will be doing
a<00:05:58.750> half<00:05:58.990> double<00:05:59.469> and<00:05:59.800> the<00:05:59.949> pattern<00:06:00.340> continues

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:01.150 
a half double and the pattern continues

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:03.480 
a half double and the pattern continues
like<00:06:01.330> that<00:06:01.360> single<00:06:02.139> half<00:06:02.379> double<00:06:02.800> double<00:06:03.280> a

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:03.490 
like that single half double double a

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:06.719 
like that single half double double a
triple<00:06:03.879> a<00:06:04.479> double<00:06:05.229> a<00:06:05.469> half<00:06:05.770> double<00:06:06.189> and<00:06:06.550> a

00:06:06.719 --> 00:06:06.729 
triple a double a half double and a

00:06:06.729 --> 00:06:10.290 
triple a double a half double and a
single<00:06:07.199> so<00:06:08.199> that<00:06:08.439> will<00:06:08.710> give<00:06:08.979> the<00:06:09.729> leaf<00:06:09.969> some

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:10.300 
single so that will give the leaf some

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:12.659 
single so that will give the leaf some
fullness<00:06:10.599> in<00:06:11.110> the<00:06:11.169> center<00:06:11.710> and<00:06:11.979> then<00:06:12.310> taper

00:06:12.659 --> 00:06:12.669 
fullness in the center and then taper

00:06:12.669 --> 00:06:19.320 
fullness in the center and then taper
off<00:06:12.939> on<00:06:13.180> the<00:06:13.330> ends<00:06:17.580> so<00:06:18.580> when<00:06:18.699> I<00:06:18.789> get<00:06:18.939> to<00:06:19.060> the<00:06:19.180> end

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:19.330 
off on the ends so when I get to the end

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:23.070 
off on the ends so when I get to the end
I<00:06:19.719> am<00:06:20.500> going<00:06:20.529> to<00:06:21.069> chain<00:06:21.460> eight<00:06:21.789> again<00:06:22.479> so<00:06:22.960> I'm

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:23.080 
I am going to chain eight again so I'm

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:24.540 
I am going to chain eight again so I'm
just<00:06:23.259> going<00:06:23.409> to<00:06:23.529> keep<00:06:23.740> my<00:06:23.889> leaves<00:06:24.129> attached

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:24.550 
just going to keep my leaves attached

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:26.339 
just going to keep my leaves attached
and<00:06:24.879> I<00:06:24.939> found<00:06:25.180> this<00:06:25.300> to<00:06:25.360> be<00:06:25.629> a<00:06:25.659> really<00:06:25.990> simple

00:06:26.339 --> 00:06:26.349 
and I found this to be a really simple

00:06:26.349 --> 00:06:29.010 
and I found this to be a really simple
way<00:06:26.529> to<00:06:26.560> do<00:06:26.860> it<00:06:27.009> and<00:06:27.250> I'm<00:06:27.939> going<00:06:28.210> to<00:06:28.479> repeat<00:06:28.840> the

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:29.020 
way to do it and I'm going to repeat the

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:31.760 
way to do it and I'm going to repeat the
leaf<00:06:29.229> pattern<00:06:29.740> of<00:06:30.009> single<00:06:30.789> half<00:06:31.240> double

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:31.770 
leaf pattern of single half double

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:35.909 
leaf pattern of single half double
double<00:06:32.770> triple<00:06:33.659> double<00:06:34.659> half<00:06:35.169> double<00:06:35.650> and

00:06:35.909 --> 00:06:35.919 
double triple double half double and

00:06:35.919 --> 00:06:38.159 
double triple double half double and
single<00:06:36.310> and<00:06:36.759> I<00:06:37.240> know<00:06:37.300> this<00:06:37.569> sounds<00:06:37.629> really

00:06:38.159 --> 00:06:38.169 
single and I know this sounds really

00:06:38.169 --> 00:06:40.890 
single and I know this sounds really
complicated<00:06:38.620> but<00:06:39.610> it's<00:06:39.759> actually<00:06:40.300> easy<00:06:40.539> when

00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:40.900 
complicated but it's actually easy when

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:43.529 
complicated but it's actually easy when
to<00:06:41.080> get<00:06:41.199> the<00:06:41.349> hang<00:06:41.500> of<00:06:41.620> it<00:06:41.879> so<00:06:42.879> I'm<00:06:43.060> just<00:06:43.240> going

00:06:43.529 --> 00:06:43.539 
to get the hang of it so I'm just going

00:06:43.539 --> 00:06:45.749 
to get the hang of it so I'm just going
to<00:06:43.599> tie<00:06:43.960> off<00:06:44.169> my<00:06:44.440> leaves<00:06:44.710> I'm<00:06:45.069> just<00:06:45.250> putting<00:06:45.610> in

00:06:45.749 --> 00:06:45.759 
to tie off my leaves I'm just putting in

00:06:45.759 --> 00:06:47.640 
to tie off my leaves I'm just putting in
