00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:06.590 

so<00:00:04.740> this<00:00:04.950> is<00:00:04.980> that<00:00:05.250> 90<00:00:05.640> millimeter<00:00:06.060> EDF<00:00:06.569> jet

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:06.600 
so this is that 90 millimeter EDF jet

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.930 
so this is that 90 millimeter EDF jet
that<00:00:07.020> I<00:00:07.049> was<00:00:07.230> building<00:00:07.440> a<00:00:07.649> while<00:00:07.830> ago<00:00:08.160> um<00:00:08.340> now

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
that I was building a while ago um now

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.480 
that I was building a while ago um now
it's<00:00:09.179> not<00:00:09.360> a<00:00:09.389> 90<00:00:09.870> millimeter<00:00:10.290> EDF<00:00:10.830> I<00:00:11.160> just

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
it's not a 90 millimeter EDF I just

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.640 
it's not a 90 millimeter EDF I just
convert<00:00:11.820> it<00:00:11.940> to<00:00:12.030> a<00:00:12.179> pusher<00:00:12.599> because<00:00:13.349> all<00:00:13.500> the

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
convert it to a pusher because all the

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.799 
convert it to a pusher because all the
ducted<00:00:14.130> fans<00:00:14.429> like<00:00:15.150> weren't<00:00:15.450> fitting<00:00:15.630> the

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
ducted fans like weren't fitting the

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:17.599 
ducted fans like weren't fitting the
motors<00:00:16.199> and<00:00:16.500> it's<00:00:16.619> just<00:00:16.770> a<00:00:16.830> big<00:00:17.010> hassle<00:00:17.190> so<00:00:17.580> I

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
motors and it's just a big hassle so I

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.490 
motors and it's just a big hassle so I
just<00:00:17.940> decided<00:00:18.150> to<00:00:18.510> convert<00:00:18.840> it<00:00:18.960> to<00:00:18.990> a<00:00:19.080> pusher

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
just decided to convert it to a pusher

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.730 
just decided to convert it to a pusher
I've<00:00:20.400> got<00:00:20.580> that<00:00:20.789> that<00:00:21.119> turnigy<00:00:21.660> motor<00:00:21.900> you

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
I've got that that turnigy motor you

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.189 
I've got that that turnigy motor you
know<00:00:22.859> that<00:00:23.039> big<00:00:23.220> one<00:00:23.430> that's<00:00:23.970> like<00:00:24.240> really<00:00:24.900> big

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
know that big one that's like really big

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.970 
know that big one that's like really big
you<00:00:25.439> know<00:00:25.820> what's<00:00:26.820> called<00:00:27.060> the<00:00:27.150> 450<00:00:27.779> k<00:00:27.990> v<00:00:28.170> 1<00:00:28.380> i'm

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
you know what's called the 450 k v 1 i'm

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.160 
you know what's called the 450 k v 1 i'm
going<00:00:29.490> to<00:00:29.550> put<00:00:29.670> a<00:00:29.699> 7-inch<00:00:30.179> prop<00:00:30.449> on<00:00:30.660> there<00:00:30.869> so

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
going to put a 7-inch prop on there so

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.110 
going to put a 7-inch prop on there so
that'll<00:00:31.470> be<00:00:31.560> really<00:00:31.710> cool<00:00:31.980> and<00:00:32.460> all<00:00:32.880> i<00:00:32.910> have<00:00:33.059> to

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
that'll be really cool and all i have to

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.850 
that'll be really cool and all i have to
do<00:00:33.270> is<00:00:33.420> connect<00:00:33.809> the<00:00:33.960> linkages<00:00:34.559> from<00:00:34.770> the

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
do is connect the linkages from the

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.910 
do is connect the linkages from the
servos<00:00:35.250> to<00:00:35.550> the<00:00:35.700> these<00:00:36.600> things<00:00:36.899> and<00:00:37.200> then<00:00:37.469> to

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
servos to the these things and then to

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.319 
servos to the these things and then to
the<00:00:37.950> rotor<00:00:38.219> and<00:00:38.489> then<00:00:38.640> it'll<00:00:38.850> be<00:00:38.910> oh<00:00:39.030> that

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
the rotor and then it'll be oh that

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.900 
the rotor and then it'll be oh that
one's<00:00:39.450> already<00:00:39.600> on<00:00:39.780> nevermind<00:00:40.260> um<00:00:40.800> and<00:00:41.760> then

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
one's already on nevermind um and then

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.150 
one's already on nevermind um and then
it'll<00:00:42.059> pretty<00:00:42.239> much<00:00:42.329> be<00:00:42.450> done<00:00:42.890> even<00:00:43.890> though<00:00:44.010> it

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
it'll pretty much be done even though it

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.279 
it'll pretty much be done even though it
doesn't<00:00:44.280> have<00:00:44.460> a<00:00:44.489> big<00:00:44.760> duct<00:00:45.719> fan<00:00:45.899> I'm<00:00:46.110> still

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
doesn't have a big duct fan I'm still

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:47.810 
doesn't have a big duct fan I'm still
going<00:00:46.410> to<00:00:46.469> keep<00:00:46.710> the<00:00:46.950> big<00:00:47.219> air<00:00:47.460> intakes

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
going to keep the big air intakes

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.880 
going to keep the big air intakes
because<00:00:48.149> they<00:00:48.270> look<00:00:48.480> cool<00:00:48.690> I've<00:00:49.620> got<00:00:49.770> my

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
because they look cool I've got my

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.970 
because they look cool I've got my
little<00:00:50.039> battery<00:00:50.789> hatch<00:00:51.030> set<00:00:51.329> up<00:00:51.480> there<00:00:51.980> i'll

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
little battery hatch set up there i'll

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.709 
little battery hatch set up there i'll
probably<00:00:53.370> get<00:00:53.610> this<00:00:53.820> thing<00:00:54.030> flying<00:00:54.300> pretty

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
probably get this thing flying pretty

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.790 
probably get this thing flying pretty
soon<00:00:55.050> and<00:00:55.320> i<00:00:56.160> also<00:00:56.309> added<00:00:56.610> a<00:00:56.850> big<00:00:57.000> KF<00:00:57.329> airfoil

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:57.800 
soon and i also added a big KF airfoil

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:02.299 
soon and i also added a big KF airfoil
kf1<00:00:58.800> i<00:00:59.039> think<00:01:00.260> so<00:01:01.260> hopefully<00:01:01.829> this<00:01:01.949> will<00:01:02.070> fly

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
kf1 i think so hopefully this will fly

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.579 
kf1 i think so hopefully this will fly
pretty<00:01:02.579> nice<00:01:02.879> with<00:01:03.270> that<00:01:03.449> huge<00:01:03.780> motor<00:01:04.320> on<00:01:04.559> it

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
pretty nice with that huge motor on it

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.870 
pretty nice with that huge motor on it
so<00:01:05.060> that's<00:01:06.060> that<00:01:06.890> so<00:01:07.890> this<00:01:08.130> is<00:01:08.159> the<00:01:08.310> next<00:01:08.549> big

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
so that's that so this is the next big

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.719 
so that's that so this is the next big
project<00:01:09.090> I've<00:01:09.540> got<00:01:09.689> going<00:01:09.900> on<00:01:10.140> um<00:01:10.439> this<00:01:11.040> is<00:01:11.369> 100

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
project I've got going on um this is 100

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.090 
project I've got going on um this is 100
inch<00:01:12.060> wing<00:01:12.360> it's<00:01:13.049> going<00:01:13.200> to<00:01:13.260> go<00:01:13.350> on<00:01:13.380> a<00:01:13.530> plane<00:01:13.770> a

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
inch wing it's going to go on a plane a

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.490 
inch wing it's going to go on a plane a
huge<00:01:14.430> cargo<00:01:14.729> plane<00:01:15.090> i<00:01:15.330> think<00:01:16.229> i'm<00:01:16.290> going<00:01:16.409> to

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
huge cargo plane i think i'm going to

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.170 
huge cargo plane i think i'm going to
call<00:01:16.650> it<00:01:16.680> a<00:01:16.799> colossal<00:01:17.310> condor<00:01:17.790> but<00:01:17.939> i'm<00:01:18.030> not

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
call it a colossal condor but i'm not

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.749 
call it a colossal condor but i'm not
quite<00:01:18.509> sure<00:01:18.540> yet<00:01:18.900> it's<00:01:19.560> got<00:01:19.740> a<00:01:19.770> cap<00:01:20.040> on<00:01:20.280> airfoil

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
quite sure yet it's got a cap on airfoil

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.149 
quite sure yet it's got a cap on airfoil
with<00:01:21.030> like<00:01:21.180> some<00:01:21.390> aluminum<00:01:21.960> like<00:01:22.860> our<00:01:23.009> odds

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
with like some aluminum like our odds

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.429 
with like some aluminum like our odds
going<00:01:23.549> down<00:01:23.790> for<00:01:24.060> stiffness<00:01:24.390> and<00:01:24.900> the<00:01:24.960> wing

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
going down for stiffness and the wing

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.190 
going down for stiffness and the wing
cord<00:01:25.710> is<00:01:25.830> 20<00:01:26.159> inches<00:01:26.360> these<00:01:27.360> big<00:01:27.720> ailerons

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
cord is 20 inches these big ailerons

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.010 
cord is 20 inches these big ailerons
that<00:01:28.470> make<00:01:28.590> it<00:01:28.710> even<00:01:28.860> more<00:01:29.360> it's<00:01:30.360> like<00:01:30.450> 24

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
that make it even more it's like 24

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.730 
that make it even more it's like 24
right<00:01:31.170> there<00:01:31.409> and<00:01:31.590> that's<00:01:31.650> got<00:01:31.939> polyhedral<00:01:32.939> um

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:33.740 
right there and that's got polyhedral um

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:38.260 
right there and that's got polyhedral um
here's<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:34.829> nose<00:01:35.159> it's<00:01:35.610> pretty<00:01:35.909> ginormous<00:01:36.570> um

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
here's the nose it's pretty ginormous um

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:41.240 
here's the nose it's pretty ginormous um
here<00:01:39.270> is<00:01:39.509> the<00:01:39.869> vertical<00:01:40.259> stabilizer<00:01:40.890> in<00:01:41.159> the

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
here is the vertical stabilizer in the

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.100 
here is the vertical stabilizer in the
horizontal<00:01:41.520> stabilizer<00:01:42.240> so<00:01:42.600> they'll<00:01:42.810> go<00:01:42.930> like

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
horizontal stabilizer so they'll go like

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.770 
horizontal stabilizer so they'll go like
that<00:01:43.350> um<00:01:44.250> basically<00:01:45.000> I'm<00:01:45.360> gonna<00:01:45.479> use<00:01:45.600> these

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
that um basically I'm gonna use these

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:52.730 
that um basically I'm gonna use these
motors<00:01:46.939> turnigy<00:01:47.939> see<00:01:48.869> 35<00:01:49.560> 40<00:01:50.189> to<00:01:50.630> 1000<00:01:51.630> kv<00:01:52.020> with

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
motors turnigy see 35 40 to 1000 kv with

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.219 
motors turnigy see 35 40 to 1000 kv with
12-inch<00:01:53.220> props<00:01:53.610> so<00:01:54.570> hopefully<00:01:54.930> that'll<00:01:55.110> be

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
12-inch props so hopefully that'll be

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.340 
12-inch props so hopefully that'll be
enough<00:01:55.290> power<00:01:55.680> to<00:01:55.860> of<00:01:56.159> those<00:01:56.310> um<00:01:57.350> basically

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
enough power to of those um basically

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.830 
enough power to of those um basically
this<00:01:58.770> plane<00:01:59.070> is<00:01:59.340> going<00:01:59.399> to<00:01:59.549> go<00:01:59.670> like<00:01:59.790> this<00:02:00.030> so

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
this plane is going to go like this so

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.510 
this plane is going to go like this so
this<00:02:01.259> part<00:02:01.649> is<00:02:01.740> just<00:02:01.920> going<00:02:02.009> to<00:02:02.070> kind<00:02:02.250> of<00:02:02.310> cut

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
this part is just going to kind of cut

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.450 
this part is just going to kind of cut
off<00:02:02.640> right<00:02:02.909> here<00:02:03.149> here's<00:02:03.450> the<00:02:03.540> wing<00:02:03.810> and<00:02:04.460> back

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
off right here here's the wing and back

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.280 
off right here here's the wing and back
here<00:02:05.820> is<00:02:05.939> just<00:02:06.090> going<00:02:06.240> to<00:02:06.299> be<00:02:06.390> emptiness<00:02:07.079> like

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
here is just going to be emptiness like

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.320 
here is just going to be emptiness like
firmer<00:02:07.710> here<00:02:07.950> here<00:02:08.220> will<00:02:08.369> be<00:02:08.459> aluminum<00:02:09.030> rods

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
firmer here here will be aluminum rods

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.080 
firmer here here will be aluminum rods
to<00:02:10.170> hold<00:02:10.379> the<00:02:10.619> horizontal<00:02:11.550> stabilizer<00:02:11.940> and

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
to hold the horizontal stabilizer and

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.520 
to hold the horizontal stabilizer and
the<00:02:12.239> vert

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
the vert

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.580 
the vert
stabilizer<00:02:13.040> on<00:02:13.250> but<00:02:14.209> basically<00:02:14.630> it's<00:02:15.530> just

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
stabilizer on but basically it's just

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.199 
stabilizer on but basically it's just
going<00:02:15.830> to<00:02:15.860> be<00:02:15.950> like<00:02:16.100> a<00:02:16.160> half<00:02:16.430> you<00:02:16.670> so<00:02:16.790> lodge<00:02:16.940> and

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:17.209 
going to be like a half you so lodge and

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:17.949 
going to be like a half you so lodge and
then<00:02:17.300> you're<00:02:17.420> going<00:02:17.510> to<00:02:17.569> be<00:02:17.660> able<00:02:17.690> to<00:02:17.840> put

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:17.959 
then you're going to be able to put

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:20.440 
then you're going to be able to put
cargo<00:02:18.440> pods<00:02:18.709> back<00:02:19.100> here<00:02:19.400> like<00:02:19.580> cameras<00:02:20.240> and

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
cargo pods back here like cameras and

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:22.300 
cargo pods back here like cameras and
parachute<00:02:20.870> things<00:02:21.140> and<00:02:21.709> they'll<00:02:21.980> just<00:02:22.130> kind

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
parachute things and they'll just kind

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.790 
parachute things and they'll just kind
of<00:02:22.340> like<00:02:22.490> connect<00:02:22.910> up<00:02:23.090> in<00:02:23.270> there<00:02:23.480> so<00:02:24.230> not<00:02:24.709> only

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:24.800 
of like connect up in there so not only

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:26.740 
of like connect up in there so not only
pretty<00:02:24.980> cool<00:02:25.250> to<00:02:25.459> go<00:02:25.580> like<00:02:25.850> a<00:02:25.910> pod<00:02:26.209> airplane

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
pretty cool to go like a pod airplane

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:28.930 
pretty cool to go like a pod airplane
that'll<00:02:27.350> be<00:02:27.410> pretty<00:02:27.530> awesome<00:02:27.740> so<00:02:28.250> that's<00:02:28.700> the

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940 
that'll be pretty awesome so that's the

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:31.540 
that'll be pretty awesome so that's the
big<00:02:29.120> plane<00:02:29.360> colossalcon<00:02:30.230> door<00:02:30.680> or<00:02:31.400> I<00:02:31.489> don't

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:31.550 
big plane colossalcon door or I don't

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:32.680 
big plane colossalcon door or I don't
know<00:02:31.700> what<00:02:31.819> to<00:02:31.850> call<00:02:31.940> it<00:02:32.120> if<00:02:32.300> you<00:02:32.390> have<00:02:32.540> any

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
know what to call it if you have any

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:35.050 
know what to call it if you have any
other<00:02:32.780> names<00:02:33.530> put<00:02:33.980> in<00:02:34.069> the<00:02:34.190> comments<00:02:34.670> but<00:02:34.850> yeah

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
other names put in the comments but yeah

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.750 
other names put in the comments but yeah
so<00:02:35.989> this<00:02:36.200> is<00:02:36.260> that<00:02:36.560> aerial<00:02:37.100> picture<00:02:37.489> plane

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
so this is that aerial picture plane

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.180 
so this is that aerial picture plane
that<00:02:38.060> I<00:02:38.090> had<00:02:38.420> going<00:02:38.690> on<00:02:38.930> and<00:02:39.260> I<00:02:39.620> put<00:02:39.830> a<00:02:39.860> GoPro

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 
that I had going on and I put a GoPro

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:42.790 
that I had going on and I put a GoPro
clip<00:02:40.730> right<00:02:41.000> there<00:02:41.360> so<00:02:41.959> the<00:02:42.050> GoPro<00:02:42.410> sticks<00:02:42.650> out

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:42.800 
clip right there so the GoPro sticks out

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:44.890 
clip right there so the GoPro sticks out
that<00:02:42.980> hole<00:02:43.190> now<00:02:43.340> and<00:02:43.520> it<00:02:43.610> takes<00:02:43.850> way<00:02:44.690> better

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
that hole now and it takes way better

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.660 
that hole now and it takes way better
pictures<00:02:45.320> when<00:02:45.560> that<00:02:45.769> other<00:02:45.920> stupid<00:02:46.430> camera

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
pictures when that other stupid camera

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:49.810 
pictures when that other stupid camera
so<00:02:47.090> we<00:02:47.650> find<00:02:48.650> this<00:02:48.800> a<00:02:48.860> lot<00:02:49.040> more<00:02:49.190> and<00:02:49.489> i<00:02:49.670> also

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:49.820 
so we find this a lot more and i also

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:51.729 
so we find this a lot more and i also
bought<00:02:50.090> a<00:02:50.150> new<00:02:50.420> fpv<00:02:50.930> system<00:02:51.320> because<00:02:51.500> mine<00:02:51.709> was

00:02:51.729 --> 00:02:51.739 
bought a new fpv system because mine was

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:53.830 
bought a new fpv system because mine was
not<00:02:52.160> working<00:02:52.430> like<00:02:52.850> the<00:02:53.150> one<00:02:53.239> that<00:02:53.330> i<00:02:53.450> had<00:02:53.600> i'm

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
not working like the one that i had i'm

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.210 
not working like the one that i had i'm
just<00:02:53.959> going<00:02:54.080> to<00:02:54.110> try<00:02:54.350> that<00:02:54.620> out<00:02:54.680> see<00:02:54.980> if<00:02:55.010> that

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
just going to try that out see if that

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:56.860 
just going to try that out see if that
makes<00:02:55.400> any<00:02:55.489> difference<00:02:55.820> I<00:02:56.180> think<00:02:56.720> it's<00:02:56.840> just

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
makes any difference I think it's just

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:58.750 
makes any difference I think it's just
interference<00:02:57.560> from<00:02:57.890> like<00:02:58.130> all<00:02:58.370> the<00:02:58.519> stuff

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 
interference from like all the stuff

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.390 
interference from like all the stuff
where<00:02:59.000> i<00:02:59.030> live<00:02:59.350> like<00:03:00.350> Wi-Fi<00:03:00.830> routers<00:03:01.190> and<00:03:01.340> all

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 
where i live like Wi-Fi routers and all

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.690 
where i live like Wi-Fi routers and all
that<00:03:01.550> so<00:03:01.700> i<00:03:01.730> bought<00:03:01.940> i'm<00:03:02.780> a<00:03:02.840> new<00:03:03.080> one<00:03:03.700> 900

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
that so i bought i'm a new one 900

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:06.490 
that so i bought i'm a new one 900
megahertz<00:03:04.970> 800<00:03:05.690> milliwatt<00:03:06.140> and<00:03:06.319> i'm<00:03:06.380> just

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
megahertz 800 milliwatt and i'm just

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:07.960 
megahertz 800 milliwatt and i'm just
gonna<00:03:06.590> see<00:03:06.950> how<00:03:06.980> that<00:03:07.280> works<00:03:07.430> out<00:03:07.760> and<00:03:07.910> i'll

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970 
gonna see how that works out and i'll

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:10.300 
gonna see how that works out and i'll
probably<00:03:08.180> put<00:03:08.390> on<00:03:08.600> this<00:03:08.750> plane<00:03:09.019> or<00:03:09.830> this<00:03:10.100> point

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
probably put on this plane or this point

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:12.850 
probably put on this plane or this point
on<00:03:10.430> my<00:03:10.550> shirt<00:03:10.760> yet<00:03:10.970> though<00:03:11.150> hmm<00:03:11.780> but<00:03:12.530> i'll<00:03:12.620> test

on my shirt yet though hmm but i'll test

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:14.710 
on my shirt yet though hmm but i'll test

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:26.360 
different ways and stuff but just as a

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:28.150 
different ways and stuff but just as a
lot<00:05:26.570> either<00:05:26.690> has<00:05:26.930> a<00:05:26.960> lot<00:05:27.170> of<00:05:27.200> gyro<00:05:27.560> shapes<00:05:27.920> or
