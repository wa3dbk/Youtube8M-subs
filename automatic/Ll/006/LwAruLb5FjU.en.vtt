00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
kind of a little bit kind of odd but

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.600 
kind of a little bit kind of odd but
maybe<00:01:51.689> I<00:01:51.810> may<00:01:52.079> be<00:01:52.140> like<00:01:52.319> yeah<00:01:52.860> yeah<00:01:53.099> definitely

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610

odd<00:01:54.060> has<00:01:54.689> sophomore<00:01:55.409> that's<00:01:55.560> what<00:01:55.799> I<00:01:55.829> did<00:01:56.069> and

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
odd has sophomore that's what I did and

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.699 
odd has sophomore that's what I did and
was<00:01:56.729> a<00:01:56.759> little<00:01:57.119> problem<00:01:57.750> so<00:01:57.989> frustrating<00:01:58.590> but

00:01:58.699 --> 00:01:58.709 
was a little problem so frustrating but

00:01:58.709 --> 00:02:00.919 
was a little problem so frustrating but
I<00:01:58.860> knew<00:01:58.979> my<00:01:59.099> time<00:01:59.280> we<00:01:59.459> come<00:01:59.750> justification<00:02:00.750> i

00:02:00.919 --> 00:02:00.929 
I knew my time we come justification i

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:03.949 
I knew my time we come justification i
think<00:02:01.200> it's<00:02:01.319> a<00:02:01.409> similar<00:02:02.099> situation<00:02:02.729> down<00:02:03.299> but

00:02:03.949 --> 00:02:03.959 
think it's a similar situation down but

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:06.259 
think it's a similar situation down but
i<00:02:03.989> have
