the<00:00:44.960> question<00:00:45.320> you<00:00:45.440> know<00:00:45.560> the<00:00:45.680> thing<00:00:45.860> is<00:00:45.890> it's

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:46.190 
the question you know the thing is it's

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:49.000 
the question you know the thing is it's
been<00:00:46.310> rusting<00:00:46.790> out<00:00:46.880> here<00:00:47.180> and<00:00:47.390> you<00:00:48.170> know

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.010 
been rusting out here and you know

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:51.700 
been rusting out here and you know
you<00:00:49.489> can<00:00:49.640> prep<00:00:50.120> it<00:00:50.149> pretty<00:00:50.449> quick<00:00:50.660> and<00:00:50.899> it<00:00:51.620> will

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:51.710 
you can prep it pretty quick and it will

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:53.549 
you can prep it pretty quick and it will
protect<00:00:51.890> against<00:00:52.280> rust<00:00:52.460> for<00:00:52.699> a<00:00:52.730> while

00:00:53.549 --> 00:00:53.559 
protect against rust for a while

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:55.110 
protect against rust for a while
so<00:00:53.890> that's<00:00:54.160> reason<00:00:54.370> why<00:00:54.520> I'm<00:00:54.610> doing<00:00:54.850> until<00:00:55.030> I

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:55.120 
so that's reason why I'm doing until I

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.450 
so that's reason why I'm doing until I
get<00:00:55.300> enough<00:00:55.660> money<00:00:55.840> to

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:57.460 
get enough money to

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:00.389 
get enough money to
