00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:12.690
 a story about improvisations 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:17.520
 worth of money my mother and 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:19.800
 meat sausage so I do not say without 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.380
 proud of my new year old son like that 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.630
 my friend exactly like that and he is not astonished 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.750
 bad so so sees a game library 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.279
 from the inside that sounds first 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.050
 Educationally questionable but one had 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.210
 He tells us in school 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.620
 give all our money to greece and 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.809
 I thought that shows me where 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.510
 really 24 hours a day dough 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.190
 to be destroyed here I say 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.980
 are looking forward to it when they grow up 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:47.520
 to throw money into a box 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:50.610
 the flashes blatantly he answers why 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.780
 Buying is not just a gameboy out 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.020
 the same reason from the chimpanzee 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:57.989
 a banana with peel pure kloppen 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:01:00.300
 because you can do it you are really hose 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.340
 but suddenly I see that one 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.780
 Employee is heading towards us child 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.070
 miserable, seriously represented 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.650
 we do it as we discussed it 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.750
 you still can not have a child with you here 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.729
 bring in the woman immediately starts the 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:15.560
 is a game room that violates 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:20.310
 the protection of the young lady I say 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:23.250
 which child your son returns that 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.000
 i not my son this is mine 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:29.200
 father in law 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:31.630
 he suffers from dwarfism and 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:33.040
 reversed aging who 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:34.810
 loses more and more folds 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:36.310
 my father-in-law dares so already 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:36.790
 hardly among people I my what would 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:38.950
 Do you 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:40.479
 as a 74-year-old former diploma 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:42.310
 engineer you can not go anywhere 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:42.810
 all staring at a unbearable is the 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:46.420
 become 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:51.160
 she died my son at the nods and 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:54.400
 says it looks like it says sorry 

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:55.690
 the woman it sounds honest is saddened 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.550
 Already well oblong to all you can 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:59.680
 not help what to at first 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:02.740
 look also think there is an age 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:03.940
 man who lived his life in 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:07.750
 patch jeans and with pokémon 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:08.020
 hooded jacket all this takes us very much 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:11.230
 With 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:14.170
 we just want a little bit for 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:20.620
 I can bring you a cognac 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:22.150
 asks the woman was my son says well 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.760
 hardly do I say to him think of that 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:29.670
 pain in the ears 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:31.560
 I did not say he 'll come say it 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:34.770
 but i really add a cognac 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:37.140
 Plato already said that is valid because 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:39.750
 all people you meet fight 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.050
 The ladies do not fight hard and 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.860
 going 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:48.750
 she acts on the ground destroying the food 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:53.300
 Was my son say I was flat around this 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:55.769
 Food was the edge father in law 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:57.300
 Suddenly my mobile phone rings. I was 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:57.560
 a while as a display then I raise 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:00.560
 from 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:03.000
 Here is your mother telling my mother 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:05.450
 I had the suspicion already after that 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:09.750
 Display a picture of my mother displayed 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:13.260
 together with the lettering mother and 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:14.280
 my popping sound as a bell are you 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.170
 traveling with the boy 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:18.660
 When I talk to my mother 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:19.950
 Most military language is everything 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:21.470
 others pull the conversation only in the 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:26.480
 length 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:29.730
 I say I confirm page near 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:30.780
 negative what's up you have me on 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:33.540
 weekend a whole kringel 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:34.950
 eat meat sausage oh god think 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:36.600
 I should have eaten what else 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:38.579
 my mother is financially good at it 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:40.980
 But your fridge looks like this 

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:43.590
 as if war she prefers to cook 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:44.570
 Things like turnips there you want nothing 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:47.579
 have to do with 

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:52.620
 to taste turnips as if it were them 

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:54.959
 spit or kohlrabi Where is it such 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:57.420
 cooked kohlrabi smells just cooked 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:59.500
 as if the depressive clown in 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:03.510
 packed the pot 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:05.890
 seriously by that I prefer batteries 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:07.090
 but on Saturday it was like sausage meat 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:08.590
 and you need not big 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:08.970
 Neighbor you have such a nice day 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:14.050
 still 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:15.040
 So I say confirm then replace it 

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:18.040
 possible tonight the meat sausage 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:20.650
 another refrigerator jasser luck was 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:23.110
 that grandma asks my son in fact 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:25.240
 We have to buy a meat sausage 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:29.200
 I have no money 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:31.720
 blank can happen more often and times 

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:32.140
 now where meat sausage take I think 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:33.490
 to 

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:38.140
 After all, I'm not at some point 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:39.310
 blödmann but author little one later 

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:41.740
 butcher in downtown 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:43.810
 my plan is clear I can buy here 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:46.060
 nothing no money why that too 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:46.930
 Disguise must be impossible 

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:49.810
 make a wish 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:51.040
 So enter like the meat good 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:54.180
 day i say i would like to have three 

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:57.040
 cooked cattle skulls but not so 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:59.410
 my son wood suddenly the butcher 

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:02.260
 it does not come with it so he has himself 

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:02.650
 Another unpleasant break occurs 

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.390
 on 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:06.640
 the butcher finally looks at my child 

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:10.530
 and then says even smaller man 

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:10.530
 do you want a lot of breakfast meat sausage 

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:18.930
 I say great kid outside that 

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:18.930
 We now have 30 times the kreml together 

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:26.950
 that was exactly 29 x 29 x snap 

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:28.990
 we want dubious meat 

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:32.650
 by dortmund only my sausage together 

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:36.700
 to puzzle the last butcher lies 

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:38.200
 a little bit outside we are going to have a good day 

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:40.620
 I say I would like two kilos 

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:43.630
 kill fried goats 

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:49.720
 The butcher looks at me and likes to say 

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:51.640
 Anything else I think my child 

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:54.100
 starts to clear your throat when you do 

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:54.760
 So do not mind him 

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:57.400
 devices 

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:58.420
 which is a waste product said a 

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:01.240
 longer break arises 

00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:05.830
 my son clears his throat again 

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:08.080
 Butchers there want to be comfortable with it 

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:14.850
 I ask yes with the victory is klöden 

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:14.850
 a year round klumpe the spendig 

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:21.460
 to whom needy what needy 

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:22.719
 Need to pull toads in the gigantic stage 

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:24.280
 you think what that doris 

00:06:22.719 --> 00:06:24.580
 talk that's nothing here 

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:26.469
 on 

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:27.669
 if I surprise the toads 

00:06:26.469 --> 00:06:29.080
 wrap film in waldorfschule 

00:06:27.669 --> 00:06:30.810
 it is still distributed my said 

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:34.650
 What is so much asking? 

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:34.650
 here you have to pass what 

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:45.830
 clutter in my son on he clears his throat 

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:49.670
 then her child is very loud 

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:51.320
 what the butcher of the butcher say no 

00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:55.250
 I really like meat very much 

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:56.510
 sausage I 'm good the butcher says one 

00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:58.250
 the usual breaks arise 

00:06:56.510 --> 00:07:01.630
 someday you have it noticeably im 

00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:04.000
 man's skull rattle smaller 

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:09.230
 do you want a lot of breakfast meat sausage 

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:12.530
 my son i think i run like old 

00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:19.030
 are you the little man 74 says man 

00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:21.640
 should 960 of the 9 

00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:23.570
 this is what the butcher asks 

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:27.590
 Nevertheless, the piece of sausage in the air 

00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:31.070
 swings nothing at all rx everything great 

00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:32.390
 The meat sausage says my son says so 

00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:34.780
 the butcher either does not like it 

00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:38.410
 used or not like being ripped off 

00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:41.630
 or both their goat toads skin off 

00:07:38.410 --> 00:07:43.070
 We are going to ring my mother and 

00:07:41.630 --> 00:07:46.790
 give the bag back to 80 percent 

00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:48.080
 ready assembled sausage for 

00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:51.950
 reparation I still have what 

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:54.470
 tasty placed next to I have very 

00:07:51.950 --> 00:07:56.420
 nice she says well, I think if you can 

00:07:54.470 --> 00:07:59.630
 The toads will be the general ones 

00:07:56.420 --> 00:08:03.430
 condition does not necessarily improve that way 

00:07:59.630 --> 00:08:03.430
 kohlrabi they fit but excellent
