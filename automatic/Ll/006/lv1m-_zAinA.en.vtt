00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.350 
up top then lastly to really finish off
the<00:01:33.960> look<00:01:34.079> I'm<00:01:34.350> going<00:01:34.710> to<00:01:34.860> also<00:01:35.310> pin<00:01:35.670> the<00:01:36.060> sides

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
the look I'm going to also pin the sides

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.440 
the look I'm going to also pin the sides
inwards<00:01:37.320> just<00:01:38.009> to<00:01:38.220> really<00:01:38.460> neat<00:01:38.939> enough<00:01:39.150> and

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
inwards just to really neat enough and

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:40.880 
inwards just to really neat enough and
refine<00:01:39.930> the<00:01:40.110> look<00:01:40.290> I<00:01:40.470> think<00:01:40.530> it<00:01:40.770> really

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
refine the look I think it really

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.429 
refine the look I think it really
completes<00:01:41.460> it<00:01:41.640> because<00:01:42.060> this<00:01:42.899> will<00:01:43.110> tend<00:01:43.380> to

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
completes it because this will tend to

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.600 
completes it because this will tend to
puff<00:01:43.680> out<00:01:43.829> too

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:46.610 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:49.520 

that<00:01:47.610> is<00:01:47.790> it<00:01:47.970> you're<00:01:48.330> done<00:01:48.510> I<00:01:48.810> love<00:01:49.290> this<00:01:49.410> look

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
that is it you're done I love this look

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:50.750 
that is it you're done I love this look
because<00:01:49.620> I<00:01:49.860> think<00:01:49.920> it<00:01:50.310> could<00:01:50.430> be<00:01:50.460> worn

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:50.760 
because I think it could be worn

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:59.480 
because I think it could be worn
casually<00:01:51.390> or<00:01:51.420> formally

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.800 

look<00:02:00.490> number<00:02:00.640> two<00:02:00.970> we're<00:02:01.299> gonna<00:02:01.420> be<00:02:01.510> doing

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:01.810 
look number two we're gonna be doing

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:04.320 
look number two we're gonna be doing
milkmaid<00:02:02.320> braids<00:02:02.729> we're<00:02:03.729> going<00:02:03.909> to<00:02:04.090> once

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:04.330 
milkmaid braids we're going to once

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:06.240 
milkmaid braids we're going to once
again<00:02:04.450> split<00:02:04.900> the<00:02:04.990> hair<00:02:05.200> down<00:02:05.409> into<00:02:06.040> two

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:06.250 
again split the hair down into two

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:10.350 
again split the hair down into two
sections<00:02:06.570> and<00:02:07.830> then<00:02:08.830> gather<00:02:09.069> one<00:02:09.490> side<00:02:09.850> and

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
sections and then gather one side and

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.960 
sections and then gather one side and
I'm<00:02:10.600> going<00:02:10.869> to<00:02:10.959> start<00:02:11.380> the<00:02:11.650> braid<00:02:11.920> closer<00:02:12.640> by

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
I'm going to start the braid closer by

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:14.760 
I'm going to start the braid closer by
the<00:02:13.030> ear<00:02:13.300> since<00:02:13.780> I<00:02:13.900> have<00:02:14.110> medium<00:02:14.470> length<00:02:14.650> hair

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:14.770 
the ear since I have medium length hair

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:16.380 
the ear since I have medium length hair
if<00:02:15.130> you<00:02:15.280> have<00:02:15.370> longer<00:02:15.610> hair<00:02:15.730> you<00:02:15.940> can<00:02:16.060> start<00:02:16.270> by

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
if you have longer hair you can start by

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.240 
if you have longer hair you can start by
the<00:02:16.450> nape<00:02:16.690> of<00:02:16.810> the<00:02:16.870> neck<00:02:16.989> but<00:02:17.590> for<00:02:17.860> those<00:02:18.010> of<00:02:18.069> us

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
the nape of the neck but for those of us

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.070 
the nape of the neck but for those of us
are<00:02:18.400> shorter<00:02:18.700> here<00:02:18.910> just<00:02:19.209> start<00:02:19.450> the<00:02:19.660> braid<00:02:19.840> up

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
are shorter here just start the braid up

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:23.130 
are shorter here just start the braid up
higher<00:02:20.380> to<00:02:20.770> achieve<00:02:21.489> the<00:02:21.670> look<00:02:21.850> and<00:02:22.090> I<00:02:22.810> just

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
higher to achieve the look and I just

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:24.840 
higher to achieve the look and I just
split<00:02:23.319> my<00:02:23.530> hair<00:02:23.739> in<00:02:23.830> three<00:02:24.010> sections<00:02:24.250> and<00:02:24.700> I'm

just gonna do a normal braid braid it
all<00:02:31.870> the<00:02:32.080> way<00:02:32.200> to<00:02:32.230> the<00:02:32.530> very<00:02:32.739> end<00:02:33.040> and<00:02:33.640> then

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
all the way to the very end and then

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.600 
all the way to the very end and then
we're<00:02:34.600> going<00:02:34.840> to<00:02:35.019> lay<00:02:35.320> this<00:02:35.350> across<00:02:35.769> the<00:02:36.070> top

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
we're going to lay this across the top

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:39.390 
we're going to lay this across the top
of<00:02:36.640> our<00:02:36.850> head<00:02:37.060> pretty<00:02:37.780> simple<00:02:38.260> I'm<00:02:38.890> gonna<00:02:39.100> pin

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
of our head pretty simple I'm gonna pin

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.490 
of our head pretty simple I'm gonna pin
crisscross<00:02:40.090> it<00:02:40.360> so<00:02:40.540> that<00:02:40.690> it<00:02:40.840> really<00:02:41.019> stays<00:02:41.319> in

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
crisscross it so that it really stays in

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.410 
crisscross it so that it really stays in
place<00:02:41.769> and<00:02:42.430> then<00:02:42.610> of<00:02:42.730> course<00:02:42.760> we're<00:02:43.180> gonna<00:02:43.269> do

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
place and then of course we're gonna do

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:44.910 
place and then of course we're gonna do
the<00:02:43.569> very<00:02:43.780> same<00:02:43.870> thing<00:02:44.080> on<00:02:44.380> the<00:02:44.500> other<00:02:44.530> side

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
the very same thing on the other side

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.490 
the very same thing on the other side
I'm<00:02:45.610> going<00:02:45.850> to<00:02:45.970> start<00:02:46.330> braiding<00:02:46.569> it<00:02:46.810> closer<00:02:47.170> by

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
I'm going to start braiding it closer by

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.500 
I'm going to start braiding it closer by
the<00:02:47.530> ear<00:02:47.980> once<00:02:48.220> again<00:02:48.580> so<00:02:48.880> that<00:02:49.030> it's<00:02:49.180> long

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
the ear once again so that it's long

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:58.050 
the ear once again so that it's long
enough<00:02:49.810> to<00:02:50.200> cross<00:02:50.440> over<00:02:56.040> I'm<00:02:57.040> going<00:02:57.400> to<00:02:57.640> lay<00:02:57.880> it

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
enough to cross over I'm going to lay it

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:59.670 
enough to cross over I'm going to lay it
over<00:02:58.269> I<00:02:58.630> kind<00:02:58.840> of<00:02:58.900> want<00:02:59.049> to<00:02:59.079> cover<00:02:59.230> this<00:02:59.470> bobby

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
over I kind of want to cover this bobby

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.380 
over I kind of want to cover this bobby
pin<00:02:59.920> so<00:03:00.130> I'm<00:03:00.250> covering<00:03:00.549> that<00:03:00.880> but<00:03:01.150> then<00:03:01.269> I'm

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:01.390 
pin so I'm covering that but then I'm

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:03.840 
pin so I'm covering that but then I'm
taking<00:03:01.570> the<00:03:01.840> very<00:03:01.989> end<00:03:02.320> and<00:03:02.620> then<00:03:02.920> tucking<00:03:03.549> it

securing with a couple of bobby pins and

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.640 
securing with a couple of bobby pins and
then<00:03:08.170> we<00:03:08.410> are<00:03:08.470> done<00:03:08.709> I<00:03:10.110> hope<00:03:11.110> this<00:03:11.290> gives<00:03:11.500> you

with<00:03:14.320> it<00:03:14.470> you<00:03:14.680> could<00:03:14.799> try<00:03:14.980> fishtail<00:03:15.519> braids

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:15.910 
with it you could try fishtail braids

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:18.900 
with it you could try fishtail braids
try<00:03:16.450> different<00:03:16.600> cut<00:03:17.290> bands<00:03:17.530> and<00:03:18.190> it'll<00:03:18.579> really

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:18.910 
try different cut bands and it'll really

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:20.460 
try different cut bands and it'll really
