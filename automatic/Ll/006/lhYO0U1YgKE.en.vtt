00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
summer now the reason why I wanted to do

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.680 
summer now the reason why I wanted to do
this<00:00:34.260> is<00:00:34.559> because<00:00:34.710> it's<00:00:35.160> different<00:00:35.540> for<00:00:36.540> my

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
this is because it's different for my

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.840 
this is because it's different for my
channel<00:00:37.020> and<00:00:37.170> it's<00:00:37.950> not<00:00:38.129> your<00:00:38.250> typical<00:00:38.370> summer

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
channel and it's not your typical summer

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.910 
channel and it's not your typical summer
where<00:00:39.260> thought<00:00:40.260> it<00:00:40.350> was<00:00:40.440> a<00:00:40.469> breath<00:00:40.710> of<00:00:40.860> fresh

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
where thought it was a breath of fresh

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.250 
where thought it was a breath of fresh
air<00:00:41.280> from<00:00:41.640> doing<00:00:42.000> all<00:00:42.239> the<00:00:42.390> summer<00:00:42.600> looks<00:00:43.020> I've

anyway they just don't know how to
regulate<00:01:10.250> classrooms<00:01:11.250> most<00:01:11.549> of<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:11.729> time<00:01:12.020> and

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
regulate classrooms most of the time and

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.480 
regulate classrooms most of the time and
in<00:01:13.170> high<00:01:13.320> school<00:01:13.350> so<00:01:13.710> if<00:01:13.950> you're<00:01:14.070> going<00:01:14.250> back

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.880 
in high school so if you're going back
it's<00:01:15.210> always<00:01:15.450> nice<00:01:15.720> to<00:01:15.750> have<00:01:16.140> a<00:01:16.170> cardigan<00:01:16.650> or

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
it's always nice to have a cardigan or

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.770 
it's always nice to have a cardigan or
something<00:01:17.250> like<00:01:17.430> that<00:01:17.490> you<00:01:17.759> can<00:01:17.909> throw<00:01:18.180> on<00:01:18.210> in

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
something like that you can throw on in

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.289 
something like that you can throw on in
a<00:01:19.380> classroom<00:01:19.619> where<00:01:20.130> it<00:01:20.280> might<00:01:20.430> be<00:01:20.460> over

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
a classroom where it might be over

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.270 
a classroom where it might be over
air-conditioned<00:01:21.930> especially<00:01:22.530> in<00:01:22.680> an<00:01:22.830> office

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
air-conditioned especially in an office

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.670 
air-conditioned especially in an office
where<00:01:23.850> I<00:01:23.909> work<00:01:24.030> it's<00:01:24.540> always<00:01:24.960> on<00:01:25.259> and<00:01:25.619> always

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
where I work it's always on and always

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.940 
where I work it's always on and always
blaring<00:01:26.580> it's<00:01:26.700> really<00:01:26.909> cold<00:01:27.380> it's<00:01:28.380> not<00:01:28.710> easy

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
blaring it's really cold it's not easy

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.670 
blaring it's really cold it's not easy
in<00:01:29.549> from<00:01:29.790> outside<00:01:29.939> but<00:01:30.570> eventually<00:01:30.840> I<00:01:31.200> get

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
in from outside but eventually I get

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.679 
in from outside but eventually I get
cold<00:01:31.890> and<00:01:32.250> so<00:01:32.490> it's<00:01:33.090> always<00:01:33.240> nice<00:01:33.450> to<00:01:33.479> have

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
cold and so it's always nice to have

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.120 
cold and so it's always nice to have
something<00:01:33.990> there<00:01:34.229> to<00:01:34.290> keep<00:01:34.560> you<00:01:34.680> warm<00:01:34.860> while

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
something there to keep you warm while

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.160 
something there to keep you warm while
you're<00:01:35.369> indoors<00:01:35.850> even<00:01:36.299> though<00:01:36.390> outside<00:01:36.840> could

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
you're indoors even though outside could

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.020 
you're indoors even though outside could
be<00:01:37.320> over<00:01:37.619> a<00:01:37.650> hundred<00:01:37.710> so<00:01:38.670> I<00:01:38.700> know<00:01:38.790> it<00:01:38.909> doesn't

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
be over a hundred so I know it doesn't

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.609
