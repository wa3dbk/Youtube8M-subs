00:00:11.909 --> 00:00:15.889
 the construction works of the Madrid and Lisbon high-speed line 

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:18.999
 they advance at a good pace 

00:00:18.999 --> 00:00:22.939
 in the talayuela-cáceres section different structures are being built 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.189
 among them the two viaducts on the rivers Tajo and the mount el 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.599
 alcantara reservoir 

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:35.710
 both are of a concrete arch type and have some lights 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:40.840
 324 and 384 meters respectively 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:48.070
 the 384 meters without intermediate supports of the central bank of the viaduct profile to 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:52.870
 Monte will make it the longest light rail bridge in the world 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:55.799
 the viaduct project 

00:00:55.799 --> 00:01:00.149
 has been conditioned by the width of the tacubos save the infeasibility of 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.940
 have batteries in the channel and the need to respect the declaration of 

00:01:03.939 --> 00:01:06.939
 environmental impact and integration into the environment 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:12.670
 according to these conditions, the commitment has been sought at all times 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:14.590
 between technical feasibility 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.590
 and the optimization of means and costs 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:24.930
 The result of this design phase has been an arch-type viaduct whose 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.010
 similarity of the sides generates an aesthetically balanced image 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:30.650
 harmonious and orderly 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:33.650
 perfectly integrated into the environment 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.250
 Similar separation between the arch uprights and the piles 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:44.830
 make it possible to use the same type of board in both areas, thus facilitating 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:47.830
 its execution and subsequent conservation 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:52.840
 of high strength concrete bifurcates on two feet to provide it with 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.740
 greater stability in a transversal sense 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.140
 the design of the whole of the structure as well as the central arch and 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.050
 board has relied on wind tunnel tests on scale models 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:08.170
 indispensable in this type of structures of great women the 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:12.640
 constructive process chosen to erect the bridge is similar to that executed with 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.659
 success in the contreras viaduct of the levante line 

00:02:17.399 --> 00:02:21.999
 the central arch will be constructed by means of temporary tension towers and 

00:02:21.999 --> 00:02:25.669
 the moderate lights between batteries will allow the use of cars 

00:02:25.669 --> 00:02:28.489
 conventional for the board 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:32.459
 the Ministry of Development and Adif promote the development of a railway 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:37.650
 authentically sustainable and respectful of nature in this sense in the 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.599
 design of the viaducts of the pit and the mountain a new 

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:43.650
 bird protection screen 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.150
 an innovative solution 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.799
 in an area of ​​great fauna interest 

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:51.379
 the prototype consists of a sweep composed of tubular profiles 

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:53.159
 verticals of doing 

00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:57.909
 this type of screens the reverse in relation to other systems the load of 

00:02:57.909 --> 00:02:59.619
 wind on the structure 

00:02:59.619 --> 00:03:03.599
 thus allowing an economic saving in the design of some elements of the 

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:04.339
 same 

00:03:04.339 --> 00:03:05.190
 on the other hand 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:08.490
 improves the aesthetics and integration of the viaduct in the environment 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:14.319
 the challenge of building the viaducts over the Tajo rivers and the mountain in the reservoir 

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:18.060
 de alcántara confirms the high level of Spanish engineering in the 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.379
 infrastructure construction 

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:24.659
 the important investment effort of the Ministry of Development 

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:29.140
 has allowed the development of a new rail network in which employment and 

00:03:29.139 --> 00:03:31.899
 economic and technological development 

00:03:31.899 --> 00:03:35.049
 a new network that the vanguard of the world's high speed 

00:03:37.779 --> 00:03:43.289
 open roads as a more efficient and accessible transport mode and safe and 

00:03:43.289 --> 00:03:45.579
 sustainable nothing 

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:51.089
 to shorten the distances we approach personal the ministry of development the
