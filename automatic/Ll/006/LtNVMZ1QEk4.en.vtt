wrong<00:00:29.519> and<00:00:30.170> it<00:00:31.170> seems<00:00:31.529> to<00:00:31.679> be<00:00:31.710> that<00:00:31.949> a<00:00:32.009> lot<00:00:32.219> of

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
wrong and it seems to be that a lot of

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.280 
wrong and it seems to be that a lot of
the<00:00:32.399> mounts<00:00:32.700> introduced<00:00:33.329> in<00:00:33.540> wallets<00:00:33.870> adrenal

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
the mounts introduced in wallets adrenal

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.770 
the mounts introduced in wallets adrenal
would<00:00:34.829> just<00:00:35.100> an<00:00:35.340> additional<00:00:35.730> counter<00:00:36.270> towards

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
would just an additional counter towards

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.930 
would just an additional counter towards
the<00:00:36.930> next<00:00:37.230> collect<00:00:37.829> X<00:00:38.070> amount<00:00:38.399> of<00:00:38.579> mounts

the next collect X amount of mounts
achievement<00:00:39.450> which<00:00:39.899> is<00:00:40.050> probably<00:00:40.290> one<00:00:40.530> of<00:00:40.559> the

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
achievement which is probably one of the

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.190 
achievement which is probably one of the
the<00:00:41.340> least<00:00:41.610> exciting<00:00:42.059> ways<00:00:42.450> to<00:00:42.899> look<00:00:43.079> at

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
the least exciting ways to look at

the least exciting ways to look at
mounts<00:00:43.710> which<00:00:43.920> is<00:00:44.129> thoroughly<00:00:44.520> disappointing

to<00:00:45.450> say<00:00:45.600> the<00:00:45.629> least<00:00:45.750> for<00:00:46.320> me<00:00:46.469> personally<00:00:46.730> so<00:00:47.730> I

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
to say the least for me personally so I

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.990 
to say the least for me personally so I
think<00:00:48.570> a<00:00:48.780> few<00:00:49.020> things<00:00:49.320> kind<00:00:50.039> of<00:00:50.160> accumulated

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
the first one is that you may notice

the the hard cold cash because they're

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:33.699 
the the hard cold cash because they're
buying<00:02:32.420> while<00:02:32.690> tokens<00:02:33.110> they're<00:02:33.290> getting<00:02:33.500> gold

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:33.709 
buying while tokens they're getting gold

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:36.270 
buying while tokens they're getting gold
for<00:02:33.830> the<00:02:33.890> trouble<00:02:34.160> everything<00:02:35.090> seems<00:02:35.450> happier

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
for the trouble everything seems happier

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.650 
for the trouble everything seems happier
so<00:02:37.280> I'd<00:02:37.670> like<00:02:37.880> to<00:02:38.030> see<00:02:38.150> some<00:02:38.390> form<00:02:38.599> of

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660 
so I'd like to see some form of

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:41.380 
so I'd like to see some form of
interaction<00:02:39.200> there<00:02:39.380> I<00:02:39.620> really<00:02:40.130> don't<00:02:40.250> see<00:02:40.400> why

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390 
interaction there I really don't see why

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:44.080 
interaction there I really don't see why
that<00:02:41.920> isn't<00:02:42.920> a<00:02:43.190> thing<00:02:43.340> or<00:02:43.550> why<00:02:43.670> that<00:02:43.880> wouldn't

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
that isn't a thing or why that wouldn't

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.030 
that isn't a thing or why that wouldn't
become<00:02:44.300> a<00:02:44.510> thing<00:02:44.780> so<00:02:45.050> that's<00:02:45.560> maybe<00:02:45.769> something

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
become a thing so that's maybe something

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:47.740 
become a thing so that's maybe something
we<00:02:46.370> will<00:02:46.430> see<00:02:46.640> you<00:02:46.790> now<00:02:46.910> it<00:02:46.970> certainly<00:02:47.330> hope<00:02:47.540> so

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 
we will see you now it certainly hope so

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:49.960 
we will see you now it certainly hope so
but<00:02:48.170> the<00:02:48.290> other<00:02:48.470> thing<00:02:48.739> is<00:02:48.980> that<00:02:49.010> Blizzard

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
but the other thing is that Blizzard

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:52.090 
but the other thing is that Blizzard
have<00:02:50.060> said<00:02:50.330> they<00:02:50.989> don't<00:02:51.230> want<00:02:51.350> flying<00:02:51.799> in

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:52.100 
have said they don't want flying in

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:57.350 
that's not just this patch that's 6.2

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:00.910 
that's not just this patch that's 6.2
and<00:02:57.500> thats<00:02:57.890> everywhere<00:02:58.760> past<00:02:59.299> 6.2<00:03:00.140> but<00:03:00.680> it<00:03:00.799> is

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:00.920 
and thats everywhere past 6.2 but it is

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.039 
and thats everywhere past 6.2 but it is
not<00:03:01.130> just<00:03:01.370> wallow<00:03:01.640> to<00:03:01.880> drown<00:03:02.060> are<00:03:02.090> either<00:03:02.330> they

00:03:03.039 --> 00:03:03.049 
not just wallow to drown are either they

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:05.140 
not just wallow to drown are either they
said<00:03:03.349> they<00:03:03.799> don't<00:03:04.069> like<00:03:04.250> flying<00:03:04.549> in<00:03:04.819> wall<00:03:05.000> as<00:03:05.120> a

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150 
said they don't like flying in wall as a

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:06.910 
said they don't like flying in wall as a
channel<00:03:05.510> and<00:03:05.810> they're<00:03:06.319> not<00:03:06.560> going<00:03:06.620> to

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:06.920 
channel and they're not going to

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:10.470 
channel and they're not going to
implement<00:03:07.280> it<00:03:07.610> in<00:03:07.730> any<00:03:07.910> future<00:03:08.180> expansions<00:03:08.930> so

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 
implement it in any future expansions so

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.699 
implement it in any future expansions so
what<00:03:11.480> are<00:03:11.510> you<00:03:11.720> going<00:03:11.870> to<00:03:11.959> do<00:03:12.049> with<00:03:12.170> mounts

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:12.709 
what are you going to do with mounts

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:14.589 
what are you going to do with mounts
because<00:03:13.459> the<00:03:13.580> only<00:03:13.730> flying<00:03:14.060> once<00:03:14.390> you've

00:03:14.589 --> 00:03:14.599 
because the only flying once you've

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:16.930 
because the only flying once you've
released<00:03:14.900> recently<00:03:15.230> we're<00:03:16.160> all<00:03:16.250> in<00:03:16.400> cash<00:03:16.670> doll

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:16.940 
released recently we're all in cash doll

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:19.660 
released recently we're all in cash doll
so<00:03:17.510> does<00:03:17.720> that<00:03:17.750> mean<00:03:18.019> with<00:03:18.680> no<00:03:19.010> more<00:03:19.190> flying<00:03:19.459> in

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:19.670 
so does that mean with no more flying in

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:21.130 
so does that mean with no more flying in
any<00:03:19.760> expansions<00:03:20.450> that<00:03:20.570> we<00:03:20.720> don't<00:03:20.900> get<00:03:21.019> any

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.140 
any expansions that we don't get any

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:22.900 
any expansions that we don't get any
more<00:03:21.320> flying<00:03:21.620> mounts<00:03:22.100> because<00:03:22.640> that<00:03:22.790> would

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:22.910 
more flying mounts because that would

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:24.819 
more flying mounts because that would
seriously<00:03:23.150> suck<00:03:23.480> some<00:03:24.049> of<00:03:24.170> the<00:03:24.230> best<00:03:24.410> mounts

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:24.829 
seriously suck some of the best mounts

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:26.890 
seriously suck some of the best mounts
and<00:03:24.950> prettiest<00:03:25.250> mounts<00:03:25.519> are<00:03:25.970> flying<00:03:26.510> mounts

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:26.900 
and prettiest mounts are flying mounts

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:28.150 
and prettiest mounts are flying mounts
you've<00:03:27.049> got<00:03:27.200> you<00:03:27.290> know<00:03:27.320> the<00:03:27.470> wind<00:03:27.680> Drake's<00:03:27.980> you

you've got you know the wind Drake's you

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.039 
you've got you know the wind Drake's you

got your cloud serpent which were just
in<00:03:30.709> the<00:03:30.829> previous<00:03:31.280> expansion<00:03:32.000> so<00:03:32.600> that

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:32.810 
in the previous expansion so that

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:35.680 
in the previous expansion so that
doesn't<00:03:32.900> really<00:03:33.079> seem<00:03:33.500> to<00:03:33.530> be<00:03:33.709> any<00:03:33.920> excuse<00:03:34.690> for

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:35.690 
doesn't really seem to be any excuse for

it's<00:04:55.370> a<00:04:55.490> wolf<00:04:55.700> but<00:04:56.660> green<00:04:58.030> cool<00:04:59.030> and<00:04:59.390> then<00:05:00.200> we

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:00.350 
it's a wolf but green cool and then we

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:02.860 
it's a wolf but green cool and then we
also<00:05:00.500> have<00:05:00.650> the<00:05:01.190> apex<00:05:01.820> is<00:05:02.060> crystal<00:05:02.630> mount

which<00:05:03.170> is<00:05:03.200> actually<00:05:03.470> changed<00:05:04.070> that<00:05:04.190> used<00:05:04.400> to

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:04.490 
which is actually changed that used to

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:05.920 
which is actually changed that used to
be<00:05:04.580> the<00:05:04.700> wolf<00:05:04.820> but<00:05:05.300> it<00:05:05.360> was<00:05:05.510> flipped<00:05:05.810> around

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:05.930 
be the wolf but it was flipped around

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:08.890 
be the wolf but it was flipped around
with<00:05:06.500> the<00:05:06.770> Raven<00:05:07.670> Lord<00:05:07.700> mount<00:05:08.180> which<00:05:08.660> is<00:05:08.870> a

flyer<00:05:09.290> I<00:05:09.680> guess<00:05:10.840> for<00:05:11.840> what<00:05:11.960> it's<00:05:12.080> worth<00:05:12.140> but

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:12.710 
flyer I guess for what it's worth but

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:16.170 
flyer I guess for what it's worth but
it's<00:05:13.190> just<00:05:13.520> a<00:05:13.730> fell<00:05:14.360> recolor<00:05:15.050> of<00:05:15.260> the

thundering and heavenly cloud serpent so

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:46.600 
thundering and heavenly cloud serpent so
not<00:05:45.620> only<00:05:45.740> did<00:05:46.010> you<00:05:46.130> have<00:05:46.310> all<00:05:46.490> these

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:46.610 
not only did you have all these

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:48.880 
not only did you have all these
different<00:05:46.850> colors<00:05:47.300> you<00:05:47.540> also<00:05:47.870> had<00:05:48.110> the<00:05:48.470> colors

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:48.890

with lightning and thunder and shiny
effects<00:05:51.920> and<00:05:52.190> then<00:05:52.580> you<00:05:52.700> had<00:05:52.880> them<00:05:53.120> again<00:05:53.450> with

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:53.990

effects and then you had them again with
the<00:05:54.170> heavenly<00:05:54.770> effects<00:05:55.150> so<00:05:56.150> there<00:05:56.930> was<00:05:57.050> a<00:05:57.080> nice

00:05:57.460 --> 00:05:57.470 
the heavenly effects so there was a nice

00:05:57.470 --> 00:05:59.410 
the heavenly effects so there was a nice
personal<00:05:58.130> touch<00:05:58.190> there<00:05:58.640> for<00:05:58.970> doing<00:05:59.240> something

00:05:59.410 --> 00:05:59.420 
personal touch there for doing something

00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:01.510

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:07.400 
the more orangey places so few people

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:10.360 
the more orangey places so few people
had<00:06:07.790> them<00:06:08.000> for<00:06:08.480> one<00:06:08.630> but<00:06:09.170> then<00:06:09.380> if<00:06:09.860> you<00:06:10.070> wanted

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:10.370 
had them for one but then if you wanted

the thundering onyx over the heavenly

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:14.180 
onyx there was a different place to go

and<00:06:14.210> you<00:06:14.360> can<00:06:14.420> happily<00:06:14.780> do<00:06:14.990> that<00:06:15.230> which<00:06:15.950> gave

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:16.190 
and you can happily do that which gave

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:17.770 
and you can happily do that which gave
it<00:06:16.340> a<00:06:16.400> little<00:06:16.520> bit<00:06:16.730> of<00:06:16.790> a<00:06:16.880> personal<00:06:17.090> touch<00:06:17.480> but

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:17.780 
it a little bit of a personal touch but

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:21.040 
it a little bit of a personal touch but
all<00:06:18.020> those<00:06:18.320> mounts<00:06:18.740> was<00:06:18.890> super<00:06:19.550> cool<00:06:19.790> and<00:06:20.150> then

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:21.050 
all those mounts was super cool and then

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:23.740 
all those mounts was super cool and then
we<00:06:21.230> kind<00:06:21.590> of<00:06:21.740> go<00:06:21.920> to<00:06:21.980> bars<00:06:22.760> tall<00:06:23.270> books<00:06:23.510> and

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:23.750 
we kind of go to bars tall books and

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:25.630 
we kind of go to bars tall books and
bulls<00:06:24.230> and<00:06:24.770> it's<00:06:24.920> just<00:06:25.100> a<00:06:25.250> little

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:25.640 
bulls and it's just a little

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:27.610 
bulls and it's just a little
disappointing<00:06:26.120> to<00:06:26.240> see<00:06:26.420> as<00:06:26.930> I<00:06:27.050> say<00:06:27.230> a<00:06:27.350> lot<00:06:27.500> of

disappointing to see as I say a lot of

disappointing to see as I say a lot of
it<00:06:27.710> seems<00:06:27.980> to<00:06:28.130> be<00:06:28.280> a<00:06:28.490> lot<00:06:28.700> more<00:06:28.760> about<00:06:29.150> padding

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:29.900 
it seems to be a lot more about padding

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:32.470 
it seems to be a lot more about padding
how<00:06:30.200> many<00:06:30.410> mounts<00:06:30.710> you<00:06:30.800> have<00:06:31.040> rather<00:06:31.790> than<00:06:32.180> the

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:32.480 
how many mounts you have rather than the

how many mounts you have rather than the

quality of the individual meant so I'm

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:38.080 
quality of the individual meant so I'm
curious<00:06:36.200> to<00:06:36.410> see<00:06:36.590> where<00:06:36.800> they<00:06:36.919> go<00:06:36.950> with<00:06:37.280> that

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:38.090 
curious to see where they go with that

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:40.480 
curious to see where they go with that
what<00:06:38.720> do<00:06:38.900> they<00:06:38.930> have<00:06:39.230> left<00:06:39.530> because<00:06:40.130> they<00:06:40.250> just

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:40.490 
what do they have left because they just

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:43.420 
what do they have left because they just
gave<00:06:40.610> us<00:06:40.820> a<00:06:40.850> bunch<00:06:41.210> of<00:06:41.419> generic<00:06:41.900> models<00:06:42.430> so

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:43.430 
gave us a bunch of generic models so

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:45.730 
gave us a bunch of generic models so
we're<00:06:44.300> going<00:06:44.389> to<00:06:44.510> need<00:06:44.660> either<00:06:44.900> a<00:06:45.260> lot<00:06:45.530> more

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:45.740 
we're going to need either a lot more

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:47.830 
we're going to need either a lot more
generic<00:06:46.250> models<00:06:46.550> next<00:06:47.180> expansion<00:06:47.479> or

generic models next expansion or

generic models next expansion or
something<00:06:48.770> actually<00:06:49.490> worthwhile<00:06:49.669> and<00:06:50.270> I

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:50.660 
something actually worthwhile and I

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:51.820 
something actually worthwhile and I
don't<00:06:50.720> know<00:06:51.080> if<00:06:51.199> they've<00:06:51.380> left<00:06:51.620> themselves

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:51.830 
don't know if they've left themselves

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:54.850 
don't know if they've left themselves
enough<00:06:52.310> room<00:06:52.580> here<00:06:52.610> to<00:06:53.570> give<00:06:53.750> us<00:06:53.900> anything<00:06:54.350> new

00:06:54.850 --> 00:06:54.860 
enough room here to give us anything new

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:57.189 
enough room here to give us anything new
and<00:06:55.520> shiny<00:06:55.790> unless<00:06:56.419> they<00:06:56.600> throw<00:06:56.840> it<00:06:56.960> up<00:06:57.050> in<00:06:57.110> the

cash store but I mean hopefully by then

cash store but I mean hopefully by then
we'll<00:06:59.870> have<00:06:59.900> some<00:07:00.290> form<00:07:00.680> of<00:07:00.800> interaction<00:07:01.520> with

we'll have some form of interaction with

we'll have some form of interaction with
the<00:07:02.120> WoW<00:07:02.240> token<00:07:02.750> so<00:07:03.020> I<00:07:03.199> don't<00:07:03.710> know<00:07:03.770> that's

00:07:03.969 --> 00:07:03.979 
the WoW token so I don't know that's

00:07:03.979 --> 00:07:05.290 
the WoW token so I don't know that's
just<00:07:04.190> kind<00:07:04.370> of<00:07:04.430> what<00:07:04.490> I<00:07:04.639> want<00:07:04.880> to<00:07:04.970> get<00:07:05.060> off<00:07:05.120> my

00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:05.300 
just kind of what I want to get off my

just kind of what I want to get off my
chest<00:07:05.330> it's<00:07:05.960> a<00:07:06.050> little<00:07:06.260> frustrating<00:07:06.550> not<00:07:07.550> to

really<00:07:07.940> care<00:07:08.360> about<00:07:08.720> the<00:07:09.710> mountainous

00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:10.220 
really care about the mountainous

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:13.060 
really care about the mountainous
expansion<00:07:10.760> which<00:07:11.690> is<00:07:11.870> a<00:07:11.900> really<00:07:12.139> odd<00:07:12.380> feeling

00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:13.070 
expansion which is a really odd feeling

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:15.760 
expansion which is a really odd feeling
not<00:07:13.820> caring<00:07:14.389> about<00:07:14.510> a<00:07:14.690> section<00:07:15.320> of<00:07:15.410> the<00:07:15.560> game

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:15.770 
not caring about a section of the game

00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:18.340 
not caring about a section of the game
because<00:07:16.460> it's<00:07:16.729> a<00:07:16.850> little<00:07:17.060> bland<00:07:17.450> and<00:07:17.780> feels<00:07:18.050> a

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:25.310 
very underwhelming so that's my thoughts

very underwhelming so that's my thoughts
on<00:07:25.550> melts<00:07:26.389> and<00:07:26.570> why<00:07:26.930> we've<00:07:27.320> had<00:07:27.560> a<00:07:27.770> little<00:07:28.310> bit
