00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:49.740 
of my jig and i have a screw set right
here<00:00:46.890> so<00:00:47.890> it<00:00:48.040> kind<00:00:48.250> of<00:00:48.310> kicks<00:00:48.580> it<00:00:48.790> off<00:00:48.880> at<00:00:49.210> an

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:49.750 
here so it kind of kicks it off at an

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:54.180 
here so it kind of kicks it off at an
angle<00:00:49.870> and<00:00:50.670> i<00:00:51.670> will<00:00:51.850> run<00:00:52.150> this<00:00:52.890> on<00:00:53.890> my<00:00:53.980> table

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:54.190 
angle and i will run this on my table

00:00:54.190 --> 00:01:00.510 
angle and i will run this on my table
saw<00:00:54.340> to<00:00:55.830> cut<00:00:56.830> that<00:00:57.010> slant<00:00:57.460> there<00:00:59.520> there's

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:00.520 
saw to cut that slant there there's

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:03.780 
saw to cut that slant there there's
quite<00:01:00.730> a<00:01:00.760> few<00:01:00.820> pieces<00:01:02.130> to<00:01:03.130> this<00:01:03.250> table<00:01:03.520> that

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:03.790 
quite a few pieces to this table that

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:06.469 
quite a few pieces to this table that
I'm<00:01:03.910> building<00:01:04.119> it's<00:01:04.989> kind<00:01:05.140> of<00:01:05.259> kind<00:01:05.920> of<00:01:06.039> has<00:01:06.219> a

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
I'm building it's kind of kind of has a

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:12.779 
I'm building it's kind of kind of has a
sunburst<00:01:08.340> shape<00:01:09.340> to<00:01:09.579> it<00:01:09.609> and<00:01:10.890> I'll<00:01:11.890> do<00:01:12.189> this

00:01:12.779 --> 00:01:12.789 
sunburst shape to it and I'll do this

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:19.999 
sunburst shape to it and I'll do this
side<00:01:12.850> then<00:01:13.749> I'll<00:01:13.899> extend<00:01:14.409> this<00:01:15.600> screw<00:01:16.600> out<00:01:17.469> and

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
side then I'll extend this screw out and

00:01:20.009 --> 00:02:17.050 
side then I'll extend this screw out and
do<00:01:21.009> the<00:01:21.039> other<00:01:21.280> side

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060

i already had some pieces made this one

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:08.050 
i already had some pieces made this one
was<00:02:59.610> one<00:02:59.849> of<00:03:00.000> them<00:03:00.769> total<00:03:01.769> of<00:03:02.130> the<00:03:02.430> sea

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.060 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:15.730 

45<00:03:09.060> of<00:03:09.600> them<00:03:10.470> now<00:03:10.770> and<00:03:12.380> my<00:03:13.380> next<00:03:13.680> step<00:03:13.860> will<00:03:14.160> be

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:15.740 
45 of them now and my next step will be

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:18.950 
45 of them now and my next step will be
putting<00:03:16.740> that<00:03:16.950> piece<00:03:17.190> of<00:03:17.220> Kali<00:03:17.730> inside<00:03:18.630> of<00:03:18.810> it

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:18.960 
putting that piece of Kali inside of it

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:24.830 
putting that piece of Kali inside of it
and<00:03:20.360> what<00:03:21.360> I<00:03:21.390> did<00:03:21.630> also<00:03:22.200> is<00:03:22.440> I<00:03:22.980> took<00:03:23.340> it<00:03:23.670> for<00:03:24.660> my

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
and what I did also is I took it for my

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:30.230 
and what I did also is I took it for my
length<00:03:25.170> I<00:03:26.180> matched<00:03:27.530> this<00:03:28.530> piece<00:03:28.830> up<00:03:29.100> I<00:03:29.400> put<00:03:30.120> my

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:30.240 
length I matched this piece up I put my

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:32.090 
length I matched this piece up I put my
fence<00:03:30.480> on<00:03:30.720> this<00:03:30.960> side<00:03:31.200> of<00:03:31.230> the<00:03:31.350> table<00:03:31.410> and<00:03:31.920> then

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:32.100 
fence on this side of the table and then

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:43.310 
fence on this side of the table and then
ran<00:03:35.840> my<00:03:36.840> guide<00:03:37.520> to<00:03:40.790> make<00:03:41.790> them<00:03:41.940> even<00:03:42.930> and

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:43.320 
ran my guide to make them even and

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:45.580 
ran my guide to make them even and
because<00:03:43.590> of<00:03:43.620> the<00:03:44.100> angle<00:03:44.460> that<00:03:44.550> I<00:03:44.610> cut<00:03:44.910> I

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:45.590 
because of the angle that I cut I

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:49.670 
because of the angle that I cut I
squared<00:03:46.590> it<00:03:46.710> up<00:03:47.270> the<00:03:48.270> piece<00:03:48.510> to<00:03:48.780> year<00:03:49.440> and<00:03:49.620> then

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
squared it up the piece to year and then

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:55.940 
squared it up the piece to year and then
I<00:03:50.060> fixed<00:03:51.060> my<00:03:51.360> fence<00:03:52.230> or<00:03:52.760> my<00:03:53.840> guide<00:03:54.840> to<00:03:55.230> push<00:03:55.800> it

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:55.950 
I fixed my fence or my guide to push it

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:02.320 
I fixed my fence or my guide to push it
through<00:03:56.990> so<00:03:58.370> the<00:03:59.370> next<00:03:59.550> step<00:03:59.760> will<00:04:00.540> be<00:04:01.070> putting

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:02.330 
through so the next step will be putting

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:05.600 
through so the next step will be putting
piece<00:04:03.330> of<00:04:03.480> holly<00:04:04.160> inside<00:04:05.160> those<00:04:05.370> grooves

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:05.610 
piece of holly inside those grooves

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:10.130 
piece of holly inside those grooves
right<00:04:05.790> there<00:04:06.560> and<00:04:07.820> I'll<00:04:08.820> show<00:04:08.970> you<00:04:09.030> how<00:04:09.270> I<00:04:09.540> do

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:10.140 
right there and I'll show you how I do

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:16.210 
right there and I'll show you how I do
that<00:04:11.120> it's<00:04:12.800> kind<00:04:13.800> of<00:04:13.950> like<00:04:14.070> inlay<00:04:14.459> but<00:04:14.790> it's<00:04:15.150> I

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:16.220 
that it's kind of like inlay but it's I

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:21.920 
that it's kind of like inlay but it's I
use<00:04:17.220> a<00:04:17.280> hammer<00:04:17.549> and<00:04:18.180> some<00:04:18.750> glue<00:04:18.959> so<00:04:19.350> here<00:04:20.070> we<00:04:20.190> go

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:21.930 
use a hammer and some glue so here we go
