00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:24.880 
my chin just to balance the top half and
bottom<00:03:22.610> half<00:03:22.850> of<00:03:23.180> my<00:03:23.209> face<00:03:23.540> out<00:03:23.780> in<00:03:24.140> hindsight

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:24.890 
bottom half of my face out in hindsight

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:26.590 
bottom half of my face out in hindsight
I<00:03:24.920> probably<00:03:25.070> would<00:03:25.550> take<00:03:25.730> this<00:03:25.910> pattern<00:03:26.360> all

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:26.600 
I probably would take this pattern all

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:28.270 
I probably would take this pattern all
the<00:03:26.630> way<00:03:26.840> down<00:03:27.080> my<00:03:27.260> neck<00:03:27.590> just<00:03:27.620> to<00:03:27.980> give<00:03:28.100> me

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:28.280 
the way down my neck just to give me

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:31.030 
the way down my neck just to give me
that<00:03:28.430> full-on<00:03:28.970> snake<00:03:29.330> look<00:03:29.570> but<00:03:30.110> you<00:03:30.650> can

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:31.040 
that full-on snake look but you can

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:32.949 
that full-on snake look but you can
choose<00:03:31.250> to<00:03:31.310> do<00:03:31.490> that<00:03:31.670> or<00:03:31.850> not<00:03:32.090> totally<00:03:32.810> up<00:03:32.930> to

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:32.959 
choose to do that or not totally up to

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:35.020 
choose to do that or not totally up to
you<00:03:33.230> I<00:03:33.260> think<00:03:33.380> it<00:03:33.560> looks<00:03:33.709> fine<00:03:33.980> either<00:03:34.459> way

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:35.030 
you I think it looks fine either way

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:37.449 
you I think it looks fine either way
then<00:03:35.810> using<00:03:36.080> a<00:03:36.290> smaller<00:03:36.620> weave<00:03:36.950> you<00:03:37.160> can<00:03:37.220> see<00:03:37.430> a

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:37.459 
then using a smaller weave you can see a

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:40.090 
then using a smaller weave you can see a
comparison<00:03:37.850> of<00:03:38.150> the<00:03:38.270> two<00:03:38.300> Here<00:03:38.900> I<00:03:39.050> am<00:03:39.290> going<00:03:39.709> to

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:40.100 
comparison of the two Here I am going to

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:43.180 
comparison of the two Here I am going to
use<00:03:40.489> a<00:03:40.520> regular<00:03:40.940> black<00:03:41.630> paint<00:03:42.080> from<00:03:42.440> my<00:03:42.590> flash

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:43.190 
use a regular black paint from my flash

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:44.440 
use a regular black paint from my flash
palette<00:03:43.550> but<00:03:43.670> you<00:03:43.730> can<00:03:43.880> use<00:03:43.970> regular<00:03:44.120> face

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:44.450 
palette but you can use regular face

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:46.479 
palette but you can use regular face
paint<00:03:44.750> and<00:03:45.020> I'm<00:03:45.260> going<00:03:45.470> to<00:03:45.500> stipple<00:03:45.800> that<00:03:46.100> over

00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:46.489 
paint and I'm going to stipple that over

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:47.920 
paint and I'm going to stipple that over
the<00:03:46.610> pattern<00:03:46.850> that<00:03:47.000> I've<00:03:47.150> already<00:03:47.360> applied

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:47.930 
the pattern that I've already applied

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:50.020 
the pattern that I've already applied
now<00:03:48.470> you<00:03:48.530> don't<00:03:48.800> overwhelm<00:03:49.250> the<00:03:49.430> brown<00:03:49.640> so<00:03:49.970> you

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:50.030 
now you don't overwhelm the brown so you

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:51.940 
now you don't overwhelm the brown so you
can<00:03:50.390> see<00:03:50.570> I'm<00:03:50.690> just<00:03:50.900> putting<00:03:51.170> it<00:03:51.290> in<00:03:51.470> sort<00:03:51.860> of

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:51.950 
can see I'm just putting it in sort of

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:54.070 
can see I'm just putting it in sort of
select<00:03:52.430> areas<00:03:53.030> so<00:03:53.360> that<00:03:53.390> it<00:03:53.780> doesn't

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:54.080 
select areas so that it doesn't

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:55.840 
select areas so that it doesn't
completely<00:03:54.290> overcome<00:03:54.860> the<00:03:55.010> brown<00:03:55.190> but<00:03:55.520> it

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:55.850 
completely overcome the brown but it

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:58.060 
completely overcome the brown but it
creates<00:03:56.239> that<00:03:56.480> interesting<00:03:57.230> speckled<00:03:57.800> black

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:58.070 
creates that interesting speckled black

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:00.190 
creates that interesting speckled black
brown<00:03:58.400> pattern<00:03:58.850> that<00:03:58.940> you<00:03:59.060> see<00:03:59.090> on<00:03:59.660> a<00:03:59.690> lot<00:04:00.050> of

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:00.200 
brown pattern that you see on a lot of

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:02.140 
brown pattern that you see on a lot of
snakes<00:04:00.440> you<00:04:01.010> can<00:04:01.160> see<00:04:01.310> I'm<00:04:01.520> doing<00:04:01.550> that<00:04:01.940> both

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:02.150 
snakes you can see I'm doing that both

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:05.500 
snakes you can see I'm doing that both
on<00:04:02.390> both<00:04:02.840> cheeks<00:04:03.050> and<00:04:03.320> the<00:04:03.650> chin<00:04:04.060> if<00:04:05.060> you<00:04:05.239> find

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:05.510 
on both cheeks and the chin if you find

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:07.030 
on both cheeks and the chin if you find
you're<00:04:05.690> getting<00:04:05.930> these<00:04:06.080> sort<00:04:06.350> of<00:04:06.470> artificial

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:07.040 
you're getting these sort of artificial

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:09.009 
you're getting these sort of artificial
linear<00:04:07.220> patterns<00:04:07.790> like<00:04:07.940> I<00:04:08.150> am<00:04:08.330> going<00:04:08.630> with<00:04:08.840> the

00:04:09.009 --> 00:04:09.019
