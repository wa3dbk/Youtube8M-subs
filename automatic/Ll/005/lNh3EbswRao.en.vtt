piqued<00:02:10.410> my<00:02:10.500> interest<00:02:10.590> is<00:02:11.039> that<00:02:11.069> this<00:02:11.370> is<00:02:11.550> only

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
piqued my interest is that this is only

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.190 
piqued my interest is that this is only
one<00:02:12.000> in<00:02:12.180> a<00:02:12.239> series<00:02:12.510> we're<00:02:12.900> going<00:02:12.930> to<00:02:13.080> get<00:02:13.140> a

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
one in a series we're going to get a

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.900 
one in a series we're going to get a
series<00:02:13.560> of<00:02:13.620> graphic<00:02:13.950> novels<00:02:14.280> along<00:02:14.640> with<00:02:14.670> our

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
series of graphic novels along with our

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:19.369 
series of graphic novels along with our
series<00:02:15.360> of<00:02:15.390> actual<00:02:15.930> not<00:02:16.140> yes<00:02:16.349> which<00:02:17.340> so<00:02:18.379> we

00:02:19.369 --> 00:02:19.379 
series of actual not yes which so we

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:22.729 
series of actual not yes which so we
should<00:02:19.620> have<00:02:19.769> plenty<00:02:20.599> plenty<00:02:21.599> of<00:02:22.080> story

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:22.739 
should have plenty plenty of story

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:25.039 
should have plenty plenty of story
combat<00:02:23.310> is<00:02:23.430> the<00:02:23.580> hope<00:02:23.760> that<00:02:24.299> I<00:02:24.360> think<00:02:24.690> there<00:02:24.900> is

00:02:25.039 --> 00:02:25.049 
combat is the hope that I think there is

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:27.589 
combat is the hope that I think there is
room<00:02:25.080> to<00:02:25.349> be<00:02:25.620> optimistic<00:02:25.769> with<00:02:26.430> this<00:02:26.640> we

00:02:27.589 --> 00:02:27.599 
room to be optimistic with this we

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:28.970 
room to be optimistic with this we
should<00:02:27.750> treat<00:02:27.959> this<00:02:28.200> and<00:02:28.410> take<00:02:28.709> them<00:02:28.860> at<00:02:28.950> their

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
should treat this and take them at their

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:30.620 
should treat this and take them at their
word<00:02:29.099> this<00:02:29.760> is<00:02:29.819> what<00:02:30.000> we're<00:02:30.120> getting<00:02:30.269> and<00:02:30.569> we

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
word this is what we're getting and we

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:32.059 
word this is what we're getting and we
can<00:02:30.750> be<00:02:30.840> skeptical<00:02:31.440> when<00:02:31.590> the<00:02:31.680> thing<00:02:31.860> actually

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:32.069 
can be skeptical when the thing actually

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:35.600 
can be skeptical when the thing actually
comes<00:02:32.489> out<00:02:33.470> so<00:02:34.470> I<00:02:34.500> think<00:02:34.650> that's<00:02:34.950> a<00:02:35.040> fair<00:02:35.280> thing

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
comes out so I think that's a fair thing

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:37.789 
comes out so I think that's a fair thing
to<00:02:35.670> say<00:02:36.030> the<00:02:36.599> graphic<00:02:36.930> novel<00:02:37.230> releases<00:02:37.680> on
