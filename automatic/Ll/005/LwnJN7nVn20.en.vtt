if<00:00:06.600> you<00:00:06.779> are<00:00:06.870> having<00:00:07.649> questions<00:00:07.979> like<00:00:08.430> what<00:00:08.790> is

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
if you are having questions like what is

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:14.950 
if you are having questions like what is
the<00:00:08.969> diversity<00:00:09.559> and<00:00:10.559> the<00:00:10.620> what<00:00:11.010> is<00:00:11.190> a<00:00:11.219> I<00:00:12.049> see<00:00:13.049> BM

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:14.960 
the diversity and the what is a I see BM

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:20.420 
the diversity and the what is a I see BM
what<00:00:15.960> is<00:00:16.200> I<00:00:16.590> see<00:00:17.310> Jaden<00:00:17.669> and<00:00:18.890> why<00:00:19.890> we<00:00:20.160> need<00:00:20.400> a

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
what is I see Jaden and why we need a

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:28.160 
what is I see Jaden and why we need a
mnemonic<00:00:21.330> later<00:00:26.689> these<00:00:27.689> are<00:00:27.750> the<00:00:27.990> questions

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
mnemonic later these are the questions

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.730 
mnemonic later these are the questions
we<00:00:28.949> are<00:00:29.010> going<00:00:29.099> to<00:00:29.460> learn<00:00:29.640> in<00:00:29.970> this<00:00:30.090> video<00:00:30.740> what

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
we are going to learn in this video what

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.479 
we are going to learn in this video what
is<00:00:31.859> diversity<00:00:32.989> diversity<00:00:33.989> is<00:00:34.379> if<00:00:35.100> you<00:00:35.280> see

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
is diversity diversity is if you see

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.270 
is diversity diversity is if you see
around<00:00:35.730> yourself<00:00:36.390> in<00:00:36.900> the<00:00:37.019> world<00:00:37.230> you'll<00:00:37.980> find

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
around yourself in the world you'll find

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:46.420 
around yourself in the world you'll find
huge<00:00:38.610> number<00:00:39.000> of<00:00:39.800> plants<00:00:41.420> animals<00:00:43.820> insects

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:46.430 
huge number of plants animals insects

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:51.770 
huge number of plants animals insects
birds<00:00:48.530> in<00:00:49.530> so<00:00:49.770> many<00:00:49.890> organisms<00:00:50.629> there<00:00:51.629> are

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
birds in so many organisms there are

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.600 
birds in so many organisms there are
plants<00:00:52.530> animals<00:00:53.129> insects<00:00:53.550> birds<00:00:54.500> etc<00:00:55.500> etc<00:00:55.980> you

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
plants animals insects birds etc etc you

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.750 
plants animals insects birds etc etc you
will<00:00:57.239> find<00:00:57.480> a<00:00:57.600> huge<00:00:57.780> number<00:00:58.079> of<00:00:58.129> animals<00:00:59.129> which

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
will find a huge number of animals which

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.660 
will find a huge number of animals which
you<00:00:59.940> can<00:01:00.090> see<00:01:00.329> with<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:00.539> naked<00:01:00.570> eye<00:01:01.070> but<00:01:02.070> there

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
you can see with the naked eye but there

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.660 
you can see with the naked eye but there
are<00:01:02.820> so<00:01:03.000> many<00:01:03.090> arguments<00:01:03.390> you<00:01:03.660> can't<00:01:03.960> see<00:01:04.670> you

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
are so many arguments you can't see you

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.410 
are so many arguments you can't see you
can't<00:01:06.060> see<00:01:06.619> with<00:01:07.619> your<00:01:07.740> naked<00:01:07.920> eye<00:01:08.340> you<00:01:09.149> can't

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
can't see with your naked eye you can't

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.800 
can't see with your naked eye you can't
see<00:01:10.520> like<00:01:11.520> unicellular<00:01:12.119> organisms<00:01:12.630> like

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
see like unicellular organisms like

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.300 
see like unicellular organisms like
viruses<00:01:14.119> amoeba<00:01:15.119> and<00:01:15.420> all<00:01:15.810> those<00:01:16.020> things

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
bacteria amoeba and many organisms you

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.969 
bacteria amoeba and many organisms you
can't<00:01:20.340> see<00:01:20.550> with<00:01:20.670> your<00:01:20.700> naked<00:01:20.910> eye<00:01:21.709> like<00:01:22.709> this

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
can't see with your naked eye like this

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.309 
can't see with your naked eye like this
there<00:01:23.580> is<00:01:23.670> a<00:01:23.700> huge<00:01:25.849> differentiation<00:01:26.849> in<00:01:27.149> the

characteristics of the required things
to<00:03:09.060> identify<00:03:09.630> it<00:03:09.690> then<00:03:10.220> you<00:03:11.220> have<00:03:11.370> to<00:03:11.519> give<00:03:11.670> the

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
to identify it then you have to give the

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:17.360 
to identify it then you have to give the
name<00:03:13.610> this<00:03:14.610> leads<00:03:14.910> to<00:03:15.739> that's<00:03:16.739> the<00:03:16.860> three-step

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
name this leads to that's the three-step

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:20.800 
name this leads to that's the three-step
process<00:03:17.750> that<00:03:18.750> is<00:03:18.870> called<00:03:19.220> identification

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:20.810 
process that is called identification

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:27.170 
process that is called identification
identification<00:03:25.519> the<00:03:26.519> second<00:03:26.880> one<00:03:27.030> is

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
identification the second one is

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:32.360 
identification the second one is
nominate<00:03:27.720> lecture<00:03:30.739> nominate<00:03:31.739> lecture<00:03:32.100> and

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
nominate lecture nominate lecture and

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:35.870 
nominate lecture nominate lecture and
the<00:03:33.000> after<00:03:33.720> naming<00:03:34.110> you<00:03:34.709> have<00:03:34.860> to<00:03:35.010> classify<00:03:35.220> it

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
the after naming you have to classify it

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:41.900 
the after naming you have to classify it

the<00:03:51.920> nominee<00:03:52.920> plates<00:03:53.190> are<00:03:53.310> naming<00:03:53.670> and<00:03:53.910> all

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
the nominee plates are naming and all

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:55.819 
the nominee plates are naming and all
those<00:03:54.269> things<00:03:54.480> otherwise<00:03:55.170> there<00:03:55.380> is<00:03:55.410> a<00:03:55.500> lot<00:03:55.709> of

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:55.829 
those things otherwise there is a lot of

00:03:55.829 --> 00:04:00.890 
those things otherwise there is a lot of
confusion<00:03:57.170> if<00:03:58.170> an<00:03:58.410> organism<00:03:59.010> you<00:03:59.280> call<00:03:59.970> with<00:04:00.870> a

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 
confusion if an organism you call with a

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:02.449 
confusion if an organism you call with a
different<00:04:01.320> name<00:04:01.470> and<00:04:01.709> someone<00:04:02.040> call<00:04:02.280> with<00:04:02.430> a

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:02.459 
different name and someone call with a

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:05.080 
different name and someone call with a
different<00:04:02.820> name<00:04:03.030> then<00:04:03.690> there<00:04:03.900> is<00:04:03.989> a<00:04:04.019> confusion

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:05.090 
different name then there is a confusion

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:07.880 
different name then there is a confusion
so<00:04:06.090> you<00:04:06.150> have<00:04:06.329> to<00:04:06.450> give<00:04:06.570> the<00:04:06.720> naming<00:04:07.049> and<00:04:07.170> you

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:07.890 
so you have to give the naming and you

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:09.920 
so you have to give the naming and you
have<00:04:08.010> identified<00:04:08.610> and<00:04:08.940> you<00:04:09.150> have<00:04:09.299> to<00:04:09.420> classify

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:09.930 
have identified and you have to classify

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:13.850

it for these things to do you need to

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:18.020
