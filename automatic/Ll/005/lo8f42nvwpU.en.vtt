00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
cast net in or the hand line in I can

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:33.500 
cast net in or the hand line in I can
always<00:00:32.189> get<00:00:32.369> it<00:00:32.460> back<00:00:32.610> it's<00:00:33.000> got<00:00:33.180> a<00:00:33.239> comfort

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
always get it back it's got a comfort

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.490

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
incredible new new yield by kick-ass and

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.170 
incredible new new yield by kick-ass and
I<00:00:49.649> want<00:00:49.800> to<00:00:49.860> show<00:00:50.039> you<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.309> Shrimpers<00:00:50.730> method

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
here and I'm splitting the cast net into

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.219 
here and I'm splitting the cast net into
two<00:01:00.870> parts<00:01:02.030> if<00:01:03.030> I<00:01:03.149> get<00:01:03.329> hold<00:01:03.510> of<00:01:03.629> half<00:01:03.840> the<00:01:04.019> cast

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
two parts if I get hold of half the cast

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:05.929 
two parts if I get hold of half the cast
net<00:01:04.439> in<00:01:04.559> one<00:01:04.710> hand<00:01:04.949> and<00:01:05.100> half<00:01:05.250> the<00:01:05.369> cast<00:01:05.580> net<00:01:05.850> in

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
net in one hand and half the cast net in

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
of the weights on the lead line I'm

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.450 
of the weights on the lead line I'm
going<00:01:31.259> to<00:01:31.350> come<00:01:31.500> in<00:01:31.590> here<00:01:31.770> and<00:01:31.950> get<00:01:32.070> a<00:01:32.100> hold<00:01:32.340> of

going to come in here and get a hold of

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.660 
going to come in here and get a hold of
the<00:01:32.670> cast<00:01:32.939> net<00:01:33.180> itself<00:01:34.159> pick<00:01:35.159> it<00:01:35.280> up<00:01:35.430> I'm

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
the cast net itself pick it up I'm

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.640 
the cast net itself pick it up I'm
loaded<00:01:36.329> up<00:01:36.450> it<00:01:36.600> doesn't<00:01:36.750> get<00:01:36.960> any<00:01:37.110> easier<00:01:37.170> than

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
loaded up it doesn't get any easier than

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:43.580 
loaded up it doesn't get any easier than
that<00:01:37.710> and<00:01:38.100> all<00:01:38.220> I<00:01:38.250> do<00:01:38.369> is<00:01:38.670> just<00:01:42.259> can<00:01:43.259> it<00:01:43.350> be<00:01:43.470> any

that and all I do is just can it be any

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.800 
that and all I do is just can it be any
easier<00:01:43.979> go<00:01:44.640> catch<00:01:44.850> yourself<00:01:45.240> some<00:01:45.390> bait<00:01:45.570> well

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
easier go catch yourself some bait well

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:51.840 
easier go catch yourself some bait well
yeah

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:51.850 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:53.830

00:01:55.419 --> 00:01:55.429 
just going to take the cast net to where

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:58.240
