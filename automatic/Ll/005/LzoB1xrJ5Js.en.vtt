Subaru Australia recommends tires should
be<00:00:47.070> checked<00:00:47.370> daily<00:00:47.579> in<00:00:48.210> order<00:00:48.570> to<00:00:48.719> ensure<00:00:49.140> the

wear don't panic though it's an easy
three-step<00:00:55.739> process<00:00:56.449> firstly<00:00:57.449> we<00:00:57.780> check<00:00:57.989> the

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
three-step process firstly we check the

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.049 
three-step process firstly we check the
tread<00:00:58.320> depth<00:00:58.590> and<00:00:59.160> what<00:00:59.340> you're<00:00:59.460> looking<00:00:59.820> for

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
tread depth and what you're looking for

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.510 
tread depth and what you're looking for
is<00:01:00.510> the<00:01:00.809> tread<00:01:01.020> depth<00:01:01.260> compared<00:01:02.010> to<00:01:02.160> the<00:01:02.280> wear

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
is the tread depth compared to the wear

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.600 
is the tread depth compared to the wear
indicator<00:01:03.090> across<00:01:03.840> the<00:01:04.049> tire<00:01:04.290> this<00:01:05.070> shows<00:01:05.400> the

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
indicator across the tire this shows the

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.080 
indicator across the tire this shows the
minimum<00:01:05.880> depth<00:01:06.390> of<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:06.689> tire<00:01:06.930> tread<00:01:07.880> so<00:01:08.880> I<00:01:08.909> can

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
minimum depth of the tire tread so I can

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.280 
minimum depth of the tire tread so I can
show<00:01:09.270> you<00:01:09.330> what<00:01:09.450> I'm<00:01:09.540> talking<00:01:09.570> about<00:01:09.930> I've<00:01:10.260> got

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
show you what I'm talking about I've got

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.980 
show you what I'm talking about I've got
one<00:01:10.950> here<00:01:10.979> that's<00:01:11.430> actually<00:01:11.640> worn<00:01:12.090> out<00:01:12.270> past

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
one here that's actually worn out past

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.020 
one here that's actually worn out past
the<00:01:13.229> wear<00:01:13.380> indicators<00:01:14.010> I<00:01:14.220> wouldn't<00:01:14.909> like<00:01:15.000> to

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
the wear indicators I wouldn't like to

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.560 
the wear indicators I wouldn't like to
be<00:01:15.210> driving<00:01:15.570> a<00:01:15.630> car<00:01:15.869> with<00:01:16.320> this<00:01:16.470> tire<00:01:16.740> on<00:01:16.770> them

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:17.570 
be driving a car with this tire on them

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:20.390 
be driving a car with this tire on them
secondly<00:01:18.570> we<00:01:19.200> do<00:01:19.320> a<00:01:19.350> visual<00:01:19.650> check<00:01:19.920> of<00:01:20.280> the

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
secondly we do a visual check of the

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.219 
secondly we do a visual check of the
tire<00:01:20.610> we're<00:01:20.939> looking<00:01:21.210> for<00:01:21.420> uneven<00:01:21.930> wear

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
tire we're looking for uneven wear

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.140 
tire we're looking for uneven wear
across<00:01:22.619> the<00:01:22.799> tread<00:01:23.100> we're<00:01:23.759> looking<00:01:23.970> for

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
across the tread we're looking for

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.749 
across the tread we're looking for
damage<00:01:24.390> such<00:01:24.869> as<00:01:24.900> a<00:01:25.080> cut<00:01:25.380> on<00:01:25.530> the<00:01:25.650> sidewall<00:01:26.130> or

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
damage such as a cut on the sidewall or

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.399 
damage such as a cut on the sidewall or
even<00:01:27.090> the<00:01:27.180> nail<00:01:27.420> in<00:01:27.689> the<00:01:27.780> tire<00:01:27.810> which<00:01:28.200> could

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
even the nail in the tire which could

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.230 
even the nail in the tire which could
happen<00:01:28.650> any<00:01:28.829> day<00:01:29.100> and<00:01:29.340> that's<00:01:29.909> why<00:01:30.060> it's

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
happen any day and that's why it's

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.289 
happen any day and that's why it's
important<00:01:30.630> to<00:01:30.689> check<00:01:30.780> this<00:01:31.229> daily<00:01:32.030> lastly<00:01:33.030> and

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
important to check this daily lastly and

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:34.999 
important to check this daily lastly and
you'll<00:01:33.750> need<00:01:33.900> a<00:01:33.930> tire<00:01:34.229> pressure<00:01:34.409> gauge<00:01:34.590> to<00:01:34.920> do

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
you'll need a tire pressure gauge to do

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.160 
you'll need a tire pressure gauge to do
this<00:01:35.280> we<00:01:35.790> check<00:01:36.000> the<00:01:36.150> pressure<00:01:36.390> of<00:01:36.630> each<00:01:36.840> wheel

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
this we check the pressure of each wheel

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.100 
this we check the pressure of each wheel
and<00:01:37.409> tire<00:01:37.590> the<00:01:38.400> one<00:01:38.640> that<00:01:38.820> I'm<00:01:38.939> using<00:01:39.210> is<00:01:39.540> like

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
and tire the one that I'm using is like

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.899 
and tire the one that I'm using is like
the<00:01:40.259> one<00:01:40.409> that<00:01:40.560> you'd<00:01:40.740> find<00:01:41.100> at<00:01:41.549> a<00:01:41.670> service

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
the one that you'd find at a service

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:47.469 
the one that you'd find at a service
station

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:47.479
