this point cuz her heel is on cooldown

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:04.340 
this point cuz her heel is on cooldown
area<00:04:02.700> he<00:04:02.940> puts<00:04:03.090> up<00:04:03.180> his<00:04:03.300> heel<00:04:03.510> and<00:04:04.170> the

area he puts up his heel and the

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:05.600 
area he puts up his heel and the
flamethrower<00:04:04.739> debuff<00:04:04.980> actually<00:04:05.280> sits<00:04:05.430> on<00:04:05.519> the
