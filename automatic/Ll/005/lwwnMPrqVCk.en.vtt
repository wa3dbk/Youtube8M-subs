00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:19.270
 in the raga and this is a new series 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:21.250
 that I have programmers do 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:23.829
 I will practically explain you in certain 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:28.419
 situations on certain modes in 

00:00:23.829 --> 00:00:29.949
 maps what I do and why we say the 

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:31.800
 king decision they have in that 

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:35.500
 moment obviously our tactics 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.780
 as I have already said several times there 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:40.449
 tactics serve but is adaptation to 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:42.430
 game that wins games and this 

00:00:40.449 --> 00:00:44.019
 I will give you a clear example 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:46.120
 to see how in this he seeks to destroy 

00:00:44.019 --> 00:00:47.770
 which comes from the one day cup 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:51.239
 last night the final is precisely 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:56.620
 against weapons organized by gamers who 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:58.449
 sign up and we are winning 2 to 1 and the 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:00.760
 match had been had already been restart 

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:04.600
 ata so we are 4 to 2 since we had 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:05.950
 already won 2 to 1 before and this will have a 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:09.970
 decisive that we will be in one 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:12.910
 I situation and take 2 against 4 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:14.500
 then here as you can see there 

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:17.649
 we will move a person person who I am 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:19.420
 I women in the center and take luca towards b 

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:21.759
 I'm running now with maradona like 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:23.200
 you can see but I will change the class 

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:24.700
 beyond the limit the class e changes 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.289
 I'll put you in the plein you need it for 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.270
 look for if someone is leaving in the app 

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:30.610
 which are just like you see and then me 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:32.440
 would help the companions mi 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:34.209
 they say there is a sniper the center 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:36.550
 I say diem I talk to make it hide 

00:01:34.209 --> 00:01:37.810
 be able to pass safely in b given 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:40.060
 that I was called that there were 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:42.149
 of people in b but there is none 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:44.229
 he had decided to return immediately to ae 

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:46.660
 reposition myself to see if it passed 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:48.670
 someone right now dies women and 

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:50.500
 soon also luca will die and will be there on 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:52.030
 decisive moment here freedom ispot has 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:55.149
 but decided to go back by 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:56.229
 be able to escape in this case 

00:01:55.149 --> 00:02:00.300
 luca dies 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:03.700
 ok now now i'm in this point 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:06.580
 you can see and leonardo is in the 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.479
 house in the center map is very important 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:09.910
 the move 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:11.890
 let's say in a synchronized way e 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:13.540
 try to break through the opposing line 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:15.730
 we decide not to defend a bomb anymore 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:17.440
 why 2 against 4 defend a bomb from 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:18.730
 alone is a bit of a suicide as enemies 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.890
 they can arrive practically from anywhere 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.359
 arrive in a group and then maybe if 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.159
 it kills one of the other can kill you 

00:02:22.359 --> 00:02:26.100
 we therefore decide to move towards 

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:31.980
 what we say is unexpected 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:33.660
 in fact now you will see immediately I move from 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.330
 I wait for the moment here 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:38.550
 exact when leonardo moves yes 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:42.450
 throws from the house 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:43.920
 see an enemy now, Leonardo and I 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.990
 I move I see an enemy 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.730
 here is I kill him shot on the corpse for 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:50.130
 put more pressure earns an rsx 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.630
 of schedules we trust to be united as already 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:53.280
 said in a very important place not 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:55.020
 stays in two united states I go to me 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.930
 put behind the decided to launch 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:59.310
 the ars xd to check the bombs 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:01.710
 having xvi is very important because 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:03.000
 as you can see from the map we can't 

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:04.590
 know where the enemies are 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.360
 you can see which ones are in b but 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:08.790
 this left serves to see if they are 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:10.650
 went to place in b as we thought in 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.850
 so that you can hurt a person or 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:14.700
 kill 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:15.930
 now I will use I will use this machine for 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:19.260
 try to kill cold that is 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:20.940
 planting the bomb while leonardo yes 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.680
 we are saying approaching in the bb area 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:25.020
 we kill the milan and last temple of 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:27.240
 travalle passes me to merckx in front and 

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:28.740
 leonardo we say , however, dies in this 

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:31.350
 case is immediately indicated by me 

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:32.640
 same I hope on the corpse because I look for 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:33.750
 to put pressure on the next ones 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:35.670
 successive rounds and wins more 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:39.360
 it is not easily a matter of little 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:40.830
 respect to the opposing team and now 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.910
 thanks to this they won we succeed in 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:44.060
 to earn one is strange then one 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:49.050
 easy victory for an upcoming attack 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:51.120
 in b because honest and useful when on 

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:52.500
 Libyan bomb is open let's say one it 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.900
 throws the enemies are forced to 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:58.430
 run away hiding or dying 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:04:01.740
 so it's an easy win I hope 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:03.270
 let's say this new v series like it 

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:05.430
 let me know in the comments I want 

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:07.830
 also use it for other modes such as 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:10.080
 ctf station obviously seeks 

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:12.380
 destroy explain to you how I think 

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:15.060
 as I my team we move into 

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:17.660
 such situations then make you 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:19.590
 understand a little how you decided to meet and 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:21.450
 game adaptation 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:23.790
 let me know in the comments I would like to see 

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:25.530
 if we say this series takes folds of 

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:28.770
 being able to load it as well let's say one 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:32.520
 map a video a day in 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:34.410
 way to explain even in situations 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:37.440
 as diar point as I move being 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:39.240
 a slayer like we say I'm going to look 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:41.870
 to lock features to staple 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:44.310
 the hard pointer like that in ctf like 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:45.990
 we extend as we take pressure from 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:47.340
 our base and so on all things 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:50.699
 interesting because it is facing 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:56.210
 at competitive then let me know with 

00:04:50.699 --> 00:04:56.210
 comments below and nice raga
