00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.590 
for the intro part I had it just sound
like<00:01:49.560> between<00:01:50.340> one<00:01:50.579> and<00:01:50.610> two<00:01:50.909> so<00:01:51.390> you<00:01:51.479> get

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
like between one and two so you get

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.139 
like between one and two so you get
plenty<00:01:51.930> of<00:01:52.200> reverb<00:01:52.710> on<00:01:52.950> that<00:01:53.159> one<00:01:53.970> thing<00:01:54.090> that

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
plenty of reverb on that one thing that

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:55.730 
plenty of reverb on that one thing that
I've<00:01:54.390> actually<00:01:54.659> never<00:01:54.930> seen<00:01:55.259> on<00:01:55.439> an<00:01:55.560> amp

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
I've actually never seen on an amp

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.069 
I've actually never seen on an amp
before<00:01:56.130> on<00:01:56.369> a<00:01:56.430> tube<00:01:56.670> amp<00:01:56.850> is<00:01:57.030> push<00:01:57.719> button

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
before on a tube amp is push button

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.350 
before on a tube amp is push button
standby<00:01:58.530> these<00:01:58.799> are<00:01:58.950> their<00:01:59.070> switches<00:01:59.430> not

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
standby these are their switches not

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:01.700 
standby these are their switches not
that<00:02:00.509> that<00:02:00.659> makes<00:02:00.899> a<00:02:00.990> big<00:02:01.110> difference<00:02:01.170> but

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
that that makes a big difference but

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.190 
that that makes a big difference but
it's<00:02:01.829> a<00:02:01.979> kind<00:02:02.490> of<00:02:02.579> novel<00:02:03.000> for<00:02:03.299> me<00:02:03.570> because<00:02:04.079> I've

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
it's a kind of novel for me because I've

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.020 
it's a kind of novel for me because I've
never<00:02:04.350> seen<00:02:04.619> that<00:02:04.710> before<00:02:04.860> as<00:02:05.579> far<00:02:05.670> as<00:02:05.909> the

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
never seen that before as far as the

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.340 
never seen that before as far as the
features<00:02:06.299> on<00:02:06.390> the<00:02:06.479> back<00:02:06.630> of<00:02:06.840> the<00:02:06.930> amp<00:02:07.079> go<00:02:07.290> you

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
features on the back of the amp go you

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.029 
features on the back of the amp go you

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320 
clean and you can turn the boost on the

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.800 
clean and you can turn the boost on the
