have a Tesla or I think I have a Tesla

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:35.680 
have a Tesla or I think I have a Tesla
or<00:04:33.710> one<00:04:34.130> of<00:04:34.160> my<00:04:34.280> last<00:04:34.610> ones<00:04:34.940> i<00:04:35.090> purchased<00:04:35.570> a

or one of my last ones i purchased a

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:38.620 
or one of my last ones i purchased a
Tesla<00:04:36.229> which<00:04:36.770> is<00:04:36.919> an<00:04:37.039> electronic<00:04:37.520> turret<00:04:38.449> you

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:38.630 
Tesla which is an electronic turret you

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:43.090 
Tesla which is an electronic turret you
also<00:04:38.990> have<00:04:39.199> this<00:04:39.949> is<00:04:40.190> not<00:04:40.400> a<00:04:41.770> defensive<00:04:42.770> turret

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:43.100 
also have this is not a defensive turret

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:45.520 
also have this is not a defensive turret
it's<00:04:43.280> a<00:04:43.400> turret<00:04:43.760> that<00:04:43.940> helps<00:04:44.300> you<00:04:44.449> to<00:04:44.720> increase

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:45.530 
it's a turret that helps you to increase

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:49.090 
it's a turret that helps you to increase
your<00:04:45.820> technology<00:04:46.820> so<00:04:47.530> quite<00:04:48.530> interesting

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:49.100 
your technology so quite interesting

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:51.850 
your technology so quite interesting
again<00:04:49.370> you<00:04:49.520> can<00:04:49.699> tap<00:04:49.940> on<00:04:50.150> there<00:04:50.449> and<00:04:50.860> increase

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:51.860 
again you can tap on there and increase

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:54.400 
again you can tap on there and increase
the<00:04:52.639> different<00:04:53.060> technologies<00:04:53.780> to<00:04:53.990> make<00:04:54.139> your

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:54.410 
the different technologies to make your

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:57.550 
the different technologies to make your
weapons<00:04:54.940> stronger<00:04:55.940> so<00:04:56.419> on<00:04:56.539> this<00:04:56.720> empty<00:04:57.199> area

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:57.560 
weapons stronger so on this empty area

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:00.460 
weapons stronger so on this empty area
we<00:04:57.770> will<00:04:57.979> build<00:04:58.280> a<00:04:58.460> Tesla<00:04:59.030> for<00:04:59.360> it<00:04:59.510> to<00:05:00.169> give<00:05:00.350> you

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:00.470 
we will build a Tesla for it to give you

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:02.020 
we will build a Tesla for it to give you
a<00:05:00.500> full<00:05:00.800> example<00:05:01.310> of<00:05:01.430> all<00:05:01.580> the<00:05:01.699> different

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:02.030 
a full example of all the different

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:04.090 
a full example of all the different
turrets<00:05:02.210> available<00:05:02.960> let's<00:05:03.500> go<00:05:03.650> ahead<00:05:03.680> and<00:05:03.860> use

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:04.100 
turrets available let's go ahead and use

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:08.290 
turrets available let's go ahead and use
our<00:05:04.250> EMP<00:05:04.610> which<00:05:05.110> really<00:05:06.729> came<00:05:07.729> back<00:05:07.970> quite

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:08.300 
our EMP which really came back quite

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:10.779 
our EMP which really came back quite
quickly<00:05:08.690> that<00:05:09.020> time<00:05:09.320> shield<00:05:10.039> generator

00:05:10.779 --> 00:05:10.789 
quickly that time shield generator

00:05:10.789 --> 00:05:12.820 
quickly that time shield generator
practically<00:05:11.539> without<00:05:11.660> any<00:05:12.139> offensive

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:12.830 
practically without any offensive

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:15.219 
practically without any offensive
capabilities<00:05:13.550> the<00:05:14.240> shield<00:05:14.539> generator<00:05:14.630> has

00:05:15.219 --> 00:05:15.229 
capabilities the shield generator has

00:05:15.229 --> 00:05:17.320 
capabilities the shield generator has
the<00:05:15.380> strongest<00:05:15.889> of<00:05:16.070> all<00:05:16.250> regular<00:05:16.729> enemies<00:05:16.910> by

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:17.330 
the strongest of all regular enemies by

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:21.930 
the strongest of all regular enemies by
far<00:05:17.690> you<00:05:18.410> can<00:05:18.590> read<00:05:18.830> that

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:21.940 

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:24.000 

and<00:05:22.330> that's<00:05:22.750> actually<00:05:23.230> what<00:05:23.380> that<00:05:23.590> is<00:05:23.770> that's

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:24.010 
and that's actually what that is that's

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:25.770 
and that's actually what that is that's
a<00:05:24.220> shield<00:05:24.580> and<00:05:24.850> he's<00:05:24.940> generating<00:05:25.450> a<00:05:25.480> shield

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:25.780 
a shield and he's generating a shield

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:27.960 
a shield and he's generating a shield
for<00:05:25.990> the<00:05:26.050> enemy<00:05:26.530> so<00:05:26.830> he<00:05:27.460> is<00:05:27.580> going<00:05:27.730> to<00:05:27.820> be

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:27.970 
for the enemy so he is going to be

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:30.180 
for the enemy so he is going to be
difficult<00:05:28.210> to<00:05:28.600> take<00:05:28.900> out<00:05:29.170> make<00:05:29.860> sure<00:05:29.890> we

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:30.190 
difficult to take out make sure we

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:32.670 
difficult to take out make sure we
repair<00:05:30.580> our<00:05:30.730> ship<00:05:30.760> you<00:05:31.630> get<00:05:31.900> the<00:05:32.050> idea<00:05:32.080> on<00:05:32.530> how

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:32.680 
repair our ship you get the idea on how

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:34.830 
repair our ship you get the idea on how
the<00:05:32.740> game<00:05:33.040> plays<00:05:33.070> I'm<00:05:33.700> almost<00:05:34.090> done<00:05:34.480> with<00:05:34.690> the

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:38.080 
wave this is not good over here let's

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:43.280 
wave this is not good over here let's
see<00:05:38.230> if<00:05:38.320> the<00:05:38.470> BAL<00:05:38.680> cruiser<00:05:39.160> can<00:05:39.310> help<00:05:39.520> us<00:05:39.670> out

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:43.290 

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:46.950 

and<00:05:44.290> he<00:05:44.500> does<00:05:44.710> so<00:05:45.330> quickly<00:05:46.330> you<00:05:46.450> see<00:05:46.780> the
