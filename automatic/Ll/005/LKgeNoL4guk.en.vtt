00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
christ love and his life but if we're

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.560 
christ love and his life but if we're
really<00:00:13.559> honest<00:00:14.009> we'd<00:00:14.280> also<00:00:14.460> see<00:00:14.910> a<00:00:15.210> lot<00:00:15.540> of

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
really honest we'd also see a lot of

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.050 
really honest we'd also see a lot of
things<00:00:15.960> that<00:00:16.320> serve<00:00:16.830> more<00:00:17.100> to<00:00:17.310> defame<00:00:17.670> him<00:00:17.910> and

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:19.060 
things that serve more to defame him and

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:22.230 
things that serve more to defame him and
I<00:00:19.090> am<00:00:19.710> should<00:00:20.710> we<00:00:20.890> be<00:00:21.070> concerned<00:00:21.119> about<00:00:22.119> the

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:22.240 
I am should we be concerned about the

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:24.150 
I am should we be concerned about the
number<00:00:22.270> of<00:00:22.689> people<00:00:22.930> who<00:00:23.289> won't<00:00:23.680> come<00:00:24.039> to

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:24.160 
number of people who won't come to

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:25.740 
number of people who won't come to
church<00:00:24.189> because<00:00:24.880> they<00:00:25.210> encountered<00:00:25.660> a

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:25.750 
church because they encountered a

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:27.810 
church because they encountered a
nominal<00:00:26.380> Christian<00:00:26.859> before<00:00:27.430> they<00:00:27.550> had<00:00:27.699> the

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:27.820 
nominal Christian before they had the

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:30.810 
nominal Christian before they had the
opportunity<00:00:28.419> to<00:00:28.449> encounter<00:00:28.989> Christ<00:00:29.489> yeah<00:00:30.489> I

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:30.820 
opportunity to encounter Christ yeah I

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:35.070 
opportunity to encounter Christ yeah I
think<00:00:31.329> we<00:00:31.539> should<00:00:32.850> is<00:00:33.850> it<00:00:34.180> important<00:00:34.899> for<00:00:34.960> a

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:35.080 
think we should is it important for a

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:36.689 
think we should is it important for a
Christian<00:00:35.470> to<00:00:35.530> fill<00:00:35.830> some<00:00:35.860> accountability

00:00:36.689 --> 00:00:36.699 
Christian to fill some accountability

00:00:36.699 --> 00:00:39.180 
Christian to fill some accountability
for<00:00:37.300> the<00:00:37.360> reputation<00:00:38.019> of<00:00:38.110> Christ<00:00:38.410> and<00:00:38.680> have

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:39.190 
for the reputation of Christ and have

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:40.799 
for the reputation of Christ and have
some<00:00:39.460> means<00:00:39.760> of<00:00:40.000> measuring<00:00:40.300> their<00:00:40.690> own

00:00:40.799 --> 00:00:40.809 
some means of measuring their own

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:45.210 
some means of measuring their own
spiritual<00:00:41.379> growth<00:00:42.210> we<00:00:43.210> think<00:00:43.480> so<00:00:43.800> we<00:00:44.800> begin<00:00:45.070> to

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:45.220 
spiritual growth we think so we begin to

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:48.240 
spiritual growth we think so we begin to
wonder<00:00:45.430> how<00:00:46.420> someone<00:00:47.079> with<00:00:47.230> nothing<00:00:47.500> to<00:00:47.860> go<00:00:48.010> by

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:48.250 
wonder how someone with nothing to go by

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:50.520 
wonder how someone with nothing to go by
could<00:00:48.850> find<00:00:49.120> a<00:00:49.269> healthy<00:00:49.659> church<00:00:49.960> with<00:00:50.409> an

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:50.530 
could find a healthy church with an

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:52.770 
could find a healthy church with an
effective<00:00:51.100> ministry<00:00:51.280> that<00:00:52.180> really<00:00:52.540> would

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:52.780 
effective ministry that really would

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:54.869 
effective ministry that really would
help<00:00:52.989> them<00:00:53.229> understand<00:00:53.769> who<00:00:53.920> Christ<00:00:54.220> is<00:00:54.489> and

00:00:54.869 --> 00:00:54.879 
help them understand who Christ is and

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:57.090 
help them understand who Christ is and
how<00:00:55.600> they<00:00:55.780> can<00:00:55.809> learn<00:00:56.199> to<00:00:56.440> become<00:00:56.559> more<00:00:56.949> like

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:57.100 
how they can learn to become more like

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:02.429 
how they can learn to become more like
him<00:00:57.159> and<00:00:58.170> that<00:00:59.170> got<00:00:59.920> us<00:01:00.100> to<00:01:00.129> wondering<00:01:00.989> how<00:01:01.989> can

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:02.439 
him and that got us to wondering how can

00:01:02.439 --> 00:01:05.640 
him and that got us to wondering how can
someone<00:01:02.739> with<00:01:03.220> nothing<00:01:03.460> to<00:01:03.790> go<00:01:03.939> by<00:01:04.530> know<00:01:05.530> if

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:05.650 
someone with nothing to go by know if
