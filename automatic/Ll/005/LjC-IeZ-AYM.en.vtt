and then we're going to weigh pounds

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:05.810 
and then we're going to weigh pounds
gonna<00:00:59.820> have<00:00:59.970> to<00:01:00.119> sugar<00:01:04.250> you<00:01:05.250> have<00:01:05.400> to<00:01:05.489> tap<00:01:05.670> it

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:03.680 
flat skimmer that works great and you
want<00:03:01.680> to<00:03:01.740> take<00:03:01.890> it<00:03:02.040> off<00:03:02.130> of<00:03:02.340> the<00:03:02.460> jam<00:03:02.760> is<00:03:03.420> nice

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
want to take it off of the jam is nice
