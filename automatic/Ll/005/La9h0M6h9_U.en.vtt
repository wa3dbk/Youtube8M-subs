 commentary position not to quarrel 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:36.530

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:48.940
 and 4 the road is free 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:06.720
 seems to be a free zone on the plan of affairs 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:13.590
 give it an overpayment 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:16.090
 Well, three quarters of an hour has not passed 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.280

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:20.580
 match 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:38.050
 he proceeds to get his feet 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:38.050
 furious tackle 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:45.860
 what is she interesting defense say 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:48.369
 nothing even prime what are you so possible 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:48.369
 to defend 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:56.190
 breaking and slapping 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.430
 lately this player is equal 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:13.920
 language match summit well 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:16.230
 today here and for 8 like something like 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:19.080
 every kind of red first think yes a 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.940
 why not doubt it and if we 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.330
 by division previous doctors everything was in 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:27.360
 okay he's in great shape 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:29.370
 playing super football his team is moving 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.540
 all the way forward so first we say 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:34.240
 scrap you 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:36.680
 take the ball 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:41.560
 he hits 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:41.560
 and here he is the first goal 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:53.000
 it is moreover another and 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:03.030
 good translation right into the thick of things 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.650
 I thought to make a mistake 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:24.170
 very important interception at height today 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:29.110
 protection and that's how sue each other 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:31.360
 tasks further what a chance man 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:35.560
 I think a little overdone and a guy from 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:37.320
 complicated it was a good chance no but dangerous 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:41.980
 still dangerous 

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:42.730
 what a dangerous moment and the score becomes 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:45.730
 equal 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:48.430
 Well, to score such bones is not required 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:53.500
 only experience and skill but also great 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:54.760
 luck is beautiful the judge announces 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:57.490
 end of the first half 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:59.440
 and yet the team that most 

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:01.330
 first half from sat in defense 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:03.100
 showed a very good game 

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:08.880
 most of the attacks remained 

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:08.880
 unrealized speak account 1 1 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:21.079
 filed well 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:26.880
 you well 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:34.650
 good pass forward 

00:04:41.689 --> 00:04:50.350
 and so you pass amongst yourself further 

00:04:44.209 --> 00:04:53.340
 further good shifting 

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:53.340
 from previous 

00:04:55.889 --> 00:05:02.030
 the whole team takes part in the defense 

00:04:57.889 --> 00:05:02.030
 the main thing is not to cuddle box 

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:10.240
 let's shift the letter 

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:25.860
 when before the ball gets blown up 

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:27.889
 expect anything lapel punch 

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:27.889
 and 

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:37.710
 or 

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:40.610
 and 

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:50.960
 good combinational football yourself 

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:54.880
 causes active use of edges 

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:59.240
 so come check on accuracy of impact 

00:05:54.880 --> 00:06:00.770
 the ball sites themselves are penalty it's head under 

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:03.410
 a blow could be a serious problem 

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:06.110
 for many brutal but not for this 

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:06.740
 corners too, you are so strong gate so 

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:08.960
 here they are 

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:13.780
 where do you beat to beat the goalkeeper 

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:13.780
 you need not strength but cunning and agility 

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:41.330
 finish the city ​​they score in the match 

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:41.330
 stays equal 

00:06:41.909 --> 00:06:44.909
 speech 

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:54.819
 wanted a corner here onlan 

00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:03.039
 not bad for thinking we ourselves gods 

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:10.540
 yes this team perfectly serves corner 

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:12.520
 statistics goalkeeper which is somewhat 

00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:14.980
 moments ago looked so 

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:18.490
 pure white now looks 

00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:21.250
 somewhat muddy school they lead into 

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:23.320
 account it is necessary to keep it now 

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:25.920
 rivals for all all 2 3 prostrate and catch 

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:25.920
 return ball 

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:37.540
