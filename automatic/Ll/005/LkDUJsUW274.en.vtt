00:02:04.169 --> 00:02:04.179 
gold is going to go there so picking the

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:07.499 
gold is going to go there so picking the
order<00:02:04.630> that<00:02:04.749> I<00:02:04.840> do<00:02:04.899> things<00:02:05.289> here<00:02:06.119> also<00:02:07.119> should

00:02:07.499 --> 00:02:07.509 
order that I do things here also should

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:09.660 
order that I do things here also should
note<00:02:07.749> that<00:02:07.780> I<00:02:08.140> didn't<00:02:08.800> assemble<00:02:09.100> this<00:02:09.369> first

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
note that I didn't assemble this first

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:13.480 
note that I didn't assemble this first
that's<00:02:10.660> because<00:02:10.960> the<00:02:11.140> detail<00:02:11.620> on<00:02:11.830> the<00:02:11.920> middle

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:13.490 
that's because the detail on the middle

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:18.280 
that's because the detail on the middle
and<00:02:13.610> this<00:02:14.390> is<00:02:14.540> that<00:02:14.780> airship<00:02:15.710> there<00:02:17.080> hi<00:02:18.080> did

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
and this is that airship there hi did

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.230 
and this is that airship there hi did
this<00:02:18.380> one's<00:02:18.620> the<00:02:19.190> base<00:02:19.370> anyways<00:02:19.790> at<00:02:19.970> the<00:02:20.060> same

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:20.240 
this one's the base anyways at the same

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:24.040 
this one's the base anyways at the same
time<00:02:20.450> as<00:02:20.720> the<00:02:21.640> black<00:02:22.640> creaking<00:02:23.240> cracking

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.050 
time as the black creaking cracking

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:28.810 
time as the black creaking cracking
sorry<00:02:24.790> and<00:02:26.410> yeah<00:02:27.410> okay<00:02:28.130> so<00:02:28.220> working<00:02:28.550> on<00:02:28.730> the

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:28.820 
sorry and yeah okay so working on the

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:32.320 
sorry and yeah okay so working on the
tin<00:02:29.030> bits<00:02:29.240> for<00:02:29.870> all<00:02:29.930> the<00:02:30.050> gold<00:02:30.200> areas<00:02:30.620> i<00:02:31.330> found

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
tin bits for all the gold areas i found

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:34.540 
tin bits for all the gold areas i found
this<00:02:32.780> area<00:02:33.200> all<00:02:33.500> these<00:02:33.680> cannons<00:02:34.130> were<00:02:34.400> the

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:34.550 
this area all these cannons were the

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:36.700 
this area all these cannons were the
most<00:02:34.700> fiddly<00:02:35.210> sort<00:02:36.050> of<00:02:36.110> things<00:02:36.230> trying<00:02:36.410> to<00:02:36.500> get

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:36.710 
most fiddly sort of things trying to get

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:40.360 
most fiddly sort of things trying to get
right<00:02:37.280> in<00:02:37.430> around<00:02:37.550> there<00:02:38.030> on<00:02:38.240> the<00:02:38.810> on<00:02:39.370> those

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
right in around there on the on those

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:42.130 
right in around there on the on those
horizontal<00:02:40.820> surfaces<00:02:41.600> the<00:02:41.810> surface<00:02:42.110> you

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
horizontal surfaces the surface you

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.180 
horizontal surfaces the surface you
can't<00:02:42.410> write<00:02:42.590> see<00:02:42.860> there<00:02:43.100> was<00:02:43.640> quite<00:02:43.970> tricky

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
can't write see there was quite tricky

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:48.570 
can't write see there was quite tricky
that's<00:02:46.190> the<00:02:46.430> black<00:02:46.850> wash<00:02:47.180> and<00:02:47.480> everything<00:02:47.810> and

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:48.580 
that's the black wash and everything and

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:51.070 
that's the black wash and everything and
on<00:02:49.580> here<00:02:49.790> as<00:02:49.850> well<00:02:50.000> I<00:02:50.180> didn't<00:02:50.660> really<00:02:50.690> worry

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:51.080 
on here as well I didn't really worry

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:52.990 
on here as well I didn't really worry
too<00:02:51.140> much<00:02:51.290> about<00:02:51.500> extra<00:02:52.280> detail<00:02:52.610> your<00:02:52.790> left

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000 
too much about extra detail your left

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.240 
too much about extra detail your left
probably<00:02:53.210> should<00:02:53.660> have<00:02:53.720> in<00:02:53.840> a<00:02:53.900> wood<00:02:54.110> color<00:02:54.380> but

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
probably should have in a wood color but

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:57.420 
probably should have in a wood color but
you're<00:02:56.210> not<00:02:56.300> really<00:02:56.450> going<00:02:56.630> to<00:02:56.690> see<00:02:56.900> that<00:02:57.080> and

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
you're not really going to see that and

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:59.890 
you're not really going to see that and
in<00:02:58.430> hindsight<00:02:58.670> you<00:02:59.060> wouldn't<00:02:59.330> see<00:02:59.480> this<00:02:59.660> green

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
in hindsight you wouldn't see this green

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.440 
in hindsight you wouldn't see this green
here<00:03:00.230> either<00:03:00.350> so<00:03:00.500> I<00:03:01.010> probably<00:03:01.940> could<00:03:02.420> have

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450 
here either so I probably could have

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:05.740 
here either so I probably could have
assembled<00:03:02.930> it<00:03:03.080> first<00:03:03.320> and<00:03:04.000> I'll<00:03:05.000> show<00:03:05.360> you<00:03:05.390> why

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:05.750 
assembled it first and I'll show you why

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
assembled it first and I'll show you why
that<00:03:06.110> might<00:03:06.290> have<00:03:06.410> been<00:03:06.440> a<00:03:06.560> good<00:03:06.650> idea<00:03:07.330> okay<00:03:08.330> so

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:08.770 
that might have been a good idea okay so

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:11.860 
that might have been a good idea okay so
working<00:03:09.770> on<00:03:10.160> the<00:03:10.370> the<00:03:10.730> gold<00:03:10.970> here<00:03:11.300> you<00:03:11.540> can<00:03:11.660> see

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 
working on the the gold here you can see

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:14.740 
working on the the gold here you can see
the<00:03:12.050> highlights<00:03:12.500> kind<00:03:13.070> of<00:03:13.160> coming<00:03:13.460> up<00:03:13.550> on<00:03:14.060> the

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750 
the highlights kind of coming up on the

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:16.030 
the highlights kind of coming up on the
silver<00:03:15.080> it's<00:03:15.290> really<00:03:15.470> hard<00:03:15.620> to<00:03:15.710> take<00:03:15.860> good

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 
silver it's really hard to take good

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:19.620 
silver it's really hard to take good
pictures<00:03:16.250> of<00:03:16.550> that<00:03:17.620> before<00:03:18.620> I<00:03:18.650> get<00:03:18.830> into<00:03:18.950> my

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:19.630 
pictures of that before I get into my

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:22.780 
pictures of that before I get into my
finished<00:03:20.630> pictures<00:03:20.990> that's<00:03:21.830> the<00:03:22.070> the<00:03:22.550> white

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:22.790 
finished pictures that's the the white

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:25.420 
finished pictures that's the the white
wave<00:03:23.780> crests<00:03:24.320> there<00:03:24.500> so<00:03:24.770> it's<00:03:24.920> a<00:03:25.010> little<00:03:25.280> bit

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:25.430 
wave crests there so it's a little bit

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:27.820 
wave crests there so it's a little bit
of<00:03:25.580> a<00:03:25.640> dry<00:03:25.850> brushing<00:03:26.410> sort<00:03:27.410> of<00:03:27.470> a<00:03:27.560> stippling

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:27.830 
of a dry brushing sort of a stippling

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:31.450 
of a dry brushing sort of a stippling
actually<00:03:29.080> this<00:03:30.080> is<00:03:30.290> that<00:03:30.470> Deneb<00:03:30.920> stone<00:03:31.250> there

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:31.460 
actually this is that Deneb stone there

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:32.920 
actually this is that Deneb stone there
so<00:03:31.580> this<00:03:31.700> is<00:03:31.820> after<00:03:32.030> I've<00:03:32.300> done<00:03:32.450> the<00:03:32.570> silver

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:32.930 
so this is after I've done the silver

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:35.350 
so this is after I've done the silver
and<00:03:33.080> you<00:03:33.620> can<00:03:33.740> see<00:03:33.890> I<00:03:33.920> don't<00:03:34.040> really<00:03:34.580> get<00:03:35.090> in

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:35.360 
and you can see I don't really get in

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:37.450 
and you can see I don't really get in
there<00:03:35.540> quite<00:03:35.960> that<00:03:36.380> good<00:03:36.410> I'm<00:03:37.130> going<00:03:37.310> to<00:03:37.370> be

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:37.460 
there quite that good I'm going to be

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:39.100 
there quite that good I'm going to be
doing<00:03:37.550> a<00:03:37.760> Devlin<00:03:38.210> mud<00:03:38.360> wash<00:03:38.600> and<00:03:38.840> so<00:03:38.900> little

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:39.110

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:42.880 
doing a Devlin mud wash and so little
how<00:03:39.230> blend<00:03:39.680> those<00:03:40.010> edges<00:03:41.380> ok<00:03:42.380> so<00:03:42.440> now<00:03:42.680> that's

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:42.890 
how blend those edges ok so now that's

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:45.130 
how blend those edges ok so now that's
the<00:03:43.040> shining<00:03:43.790> gold<00:03:44.030> on<00:03:44.300> all<00:03:44.510> the<00:03:44.630> gold<00:03:44.810> areas

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:45.140 
the shining gold on all the gold areas

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:47.200 
the shining gold on all the gold areas
and<00:03:45.380> again<00:03:46.220> just<00:03:46.340> trying<00:03:46.550> to<00:03:46.610> pick<00:03:46.760> up<00:03:46.880> all<00:03:47.090> the

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:47.210 
and again just trying to pick up all the

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:50.380 
and again just trying to pick up all the
raised<00:03:47.420> bits<00:03:47.780> and<00:03:48.700> mithril<00:03:49.700> silver<00:03:50.030> will<00:03:50.210> go

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:50.390 
raised bits and mithril silver will go

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:53.380 
raised bits and mithril silver will go
over<00:03:50.510> top<00:03:50.780> of<00:03:50.840> everything<00:03:52.060> ok<00:03:53.060> so<00:03:53.120> I've

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:53.390 
over top of everything ok so I've

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:56.560 
over top of everything ok so I've
assembled<00:03:53.720> it<00:03:53.990> now<00:03:54.200> I<00:03:55.100> do<00:03:55.400> the<00:03:56.000> white<00:03:56.240> bits

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:56.570 
assembled it now I do the white bits

00:03:56.570 --> 00:04:00.070 
assembled it now I do the white bits
after<00:03:57.290> that<00:03:57.410> but<00:03:57.800> i<00:03:58.420> wanted<00:03:59.420> to<00:03:59.480> assemble<00:03:59.960> it

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:00.080 
after that but i wanted to assemble it

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:01.450 
after that but i wanted to assemble it
just<00:04:00.230> to<00:04:00.350> see<00:04:00.530> if<00:04:00.620> there's<00:04:00.800> any<00:04:00.890> areas<00:04:01.100> i<00:04:01.340> could

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:01.460 
just to see if there's any areas i could

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:03.700 
just to see if there's any areas i could
paint<00:04:01.670> over<00:04:01.910> there's<00:04:02.180> a<00:04:02.240> bad<00:04:02.570> joint<00:04:03.170> kind<00:04:03.620> of

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:03.710 
paint over there's a bad joint kind of

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:05.230 
paint over there's a bad joint kind of
there<00:04:03.890> that<00:04:04.490> would<00:04:04.610> have<00:04:04.700> been<00:04:04.760> better<00:04:04.970> if<00:04:05.060> I

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:05.240 
there that would have been better if I

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:07.990 
there that would have been better if I
had<00:04:05.800> glued<00:04:06.800> it<00:04:06.920> before<00:04:07.460> I<00:04:07.490> painted<00:04:07.880> it<00:04:07.940> and

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:08.000 
had glued it before I painted it and

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.360 
had glued it before I painted it and
then<00:04:08.180> filled<00:04:08.420> it<00:04:08.600> but<00:04:09.530> painting<00:04:09.890> inside<00:04:10.130> here

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:10.370 
then filled it but painting inside here

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:12.400 
then filled it but painting inside here
might<00:04:10.550> have<00:04:10.670> been<00:04:10.760> tricky<00:04:11.120> so<00:04:11.420> it<00:04:12.110> was<00:04:12.260> a<00:04:12.290> bit

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:12.410 
might have been tricky so it was a bit

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:16.210 
might have been tricky so it was a bit
of<00:04:12.500> a<00:04:12.560> trade-off<00:04:12.740> and<00:04:13.250> that's<00:04:14.240> what<00:04:14.450> one<00:04:14.920> ok<00:04:15.920> so

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:16.220 
of a trade-off and that's what one ok so

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:18.570 
of a trade-off and that's what one ok so
here<00:04:16.910> we<00:04:17.030> are<00:04:17.120> looking<00:04:17.359> a<00:04:17.450> bit<00:04:17.480> closer<00:04:17.900> and

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:18.580 
here we are looking a bit closer and

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:21.460 
here we are looking a bit closer and
getting<00:04:19.580> the<00:04:19.730> the<00:04:20.060> chainmail<00:04:20.359> sort<00:04:20.900> of<00:04:21.020> along

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:21.470 
getting the the chainmail sort of along

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:23.500 
getting the the chainmail sort of along
the<00:04:21.680> edges<00:04:21.859> there<00:04:22.310> and<00:04:22.790> going<00:04:23.240> to<00:04:23.330> try<00:04:23.479> to

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:23.510 
the edges there and going to try to

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:25.719 
the edges there and going to try to
highlight<00:04:24.050> that<00:04:24.290> a<00:04:24.350> bit<00:04:24.560> with<00:04:24.680> mithril<00:04:25.100> silver

00:04:25.719 --> 00:04:25.729 
highlight that a bit with mithril silver

00:04:25.729 --> 00:04:27.129 
highlight that a bit with mithril silver
as<00:04:25.820> well

00:04:27.129 --> 00:04:27.139 
as well

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:29.480 
as well
there's<00:04:28.139> the<00:04:28.319> snot<00:04:28.560> green<00:04:28.800> kind<00:04:29.190> of<00:04:29.280> going

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:29.490 
there's the snot green kind of going

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:32.689 
there's the snot green kind of going
around<00:04:29.580> the<00:04:29.819> edge<00:04:29.940> there<00:04:30.770> I<00:04:31.770> actually<00:04:32.340> really

00:04:32.689 --> 00:04:32.699 
around the edge there I actually really

00:04:32.699 --> 00:04:36.379 
around the edge there I actually really
liked<00:04:32.910> how<00:04:33.120> that<00:04:33.150> narla<00:04:33.660> green<00:04:35.389> highlighted

00:04:36.379 --> 00:04:36.389 
liked how that narla green highlighted

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:38.330 
liked how that narla green highlighted
up<00:04:36.599> with<00:04:36.780> goblin<00:04:37.169> green<00:04:37.379> and<00:04:37.650> n<00:04:37.830> snot<00:04:38.099> green

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:38.340 
up with goblin green and n snot green

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:40.790 
up with goblin green and n snot green
sorry<00:04:39.330> snot<00:04:39.599> green<00:04:39.720> den<00:04:39.960> goblin<00:04:40.349> green<00:04:40.530> that

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:40.800 
sorry snot green den goblin green that

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.320 
sorry snot green den goblin green that
turned<00:04:41.099> out<00:04:41.190> better<00:04:41.759> than<00:04:41.909> I<00:04:42.090> thought<00:04:42.120> it

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:42.330 
turned out better than I thought it

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:45.350 
turned out better than I thought it
would<00:04:42.449> and<00:04:43.099> the<00:04:44.099> black<00:04:44.370> there<00:04:44.759> I<00:04:44.789> really

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:45.360 
would and the black there I really

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:47.390 
would and the black there I really
actually<00:04:45.840> quite<00:04:46.110> like<00:04:46.289> that<00:04:46.349> it<00:04:46.860> was<00:04:47.039> pretty

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:47.400 
actually quite like that it was pretty

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:49.580 
actually quite like that it was pretty
straightforward<00:04:48.090> basically<00:04:48.690> just<00:04:49.199> tried<00:04:49.470> to

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:49.590 
straightforward basically just tried to

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:51.710 
straightforward basically just tried to
avoid<00:04:49.889> the<00:04:50.159> really<00:04:50.430> dark<00:04:50.699> areas<00:04:51.210> with<00:04:51.690> the

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:51.720 
avoid the really dark areas with the

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:54.110 
avoid the really dark areas with the
snot<00:04:52.050> green<00:04:52.199> and<00:04:52.530> then<00:04:52.710> just<00:04:52.949> did<00:04:53.190> well<00:04:54.000> you'll

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:54.120 
snot green and then just did well you'll

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.350 
snot green and then just did well you'll
see<00:04:54.300> the<00:04:54.479> the<00:04:55.199> Goblin<00:04:55.560> green<00:04:55.740> how<00:04:55.889> I<00:04:55.919> did<00:04:56.159> that

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:56.360 
see the the Goblin green how I did that

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:59.240 
see the the Goblin green how I did that
yeah<00:04:57.360> actually<00:04:57.569> so<00:04:58.169> here<00:04:58.409> you<00:04:58.560> can<00:04:58.590> see<00:04:58.710> I<00:04:58.860> kind

00:04:59.240 --> 00:04:59.250 
yeah actually so here you can see I kind

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:01.820 
yeah actually so here you can see I kind
of<00:04:59.280> just<00:04:59.460> did<00:04:59.639> a<00:04:59.669> line<00:05:00.090> around<00:05:00.330> things<00:05:00.900> kind<00:05:01.770> of

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:01.830 
of just did a line around things kind of

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:04.790 
of just did a line around things kind of
the<00:05:01.949> halo<00:05:02.250> effect<00:05:03.169> with<00:05:04.169> a<00:05:04.199> really<00:05:04.560> fine<00:05:04.740> line

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:04.800 
the halo effect with a really fine line

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:08.270 
the halo effect with a really fine line
a<00:05:05.069> goblin<00:05:05.550> green<00:05:06.229> and<00:05:07.229> like<00:05:08.099> I<00:05:08.220> mentioned

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:08.280 
a goblin green and like I mentioned

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:12.890 
a goblin green and like I mentioned
there's<00:05:08.759> a<00:05:08.819> bad<00:05:09.060> joint<00:05:09.900> there<00:05:10.789> but<00:05:11.900> not

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:12.900 
there's a bad joint there but not

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:16.309 
there's a bad joint there but not
probably<00:05:13.229> going<00:05:13.380> to<00:05:13.440> fill<00:05:13.590> that<00:05:13.620> in<00:05:13.770> and<00:05:15.319> now

00:05:16.309 --> 00:05:16.319 
probably going to fill that in and now

00:05:16.319 --> 00:05:19.219 
probably going to fill that in and now
that's<00:05:16.620> it<00:05:16.860> that's<00:05:17.039> done<00:05:17.370> so<00:05:17.990> this<00:05:18.990> one<00:05:19.139> was

00:05:19.219 --> 00:05:19.229 
that's it that's done so this one was

00:05:19.229 --> 00:05:20.990 
that's it that's done so this one was
pretty<00:05:19.469> straightforward<00:05:20.159> the<00:05:20.340> only<00:05:20.580> tricky

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:21.000 
pretty straightforward the only tricky

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.730 
pretty straightforward the only tricky
bit<00:05:21.150> was<00:05:21.300> trying<00:05:21.539> to<00:05:21.630> get<00:05:21.750> the<00:05:21.930> the<00:05:21.960> metals<00:05:22.500> to

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:22.740 
bit was trying to get the the metals to

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:25.309 
bit was trying to get the the metals to
look<00:05:22.860> really<00:05:23.130> nice<00:05:23.280> and<00:05:23.580> I<00:05:24.389> think<00:05:24.599> I<00:05:24.719> I<00:05:24.750> think<00:05:25.259> i

00:05:25.309 --> 00:05:25.319 
look really nice and I think I I think i

00:05:25.319 --> 00:05:29.749 
look really nice and I think I I think i
was<00:05:25.440> able<00:05:25.560> to<00:05:25.770> get<00:05:25.889> it<00:05:26.310> ok<00:05:28.400> metals<00:05:29.400> i<00:05:29.520> find

00:05:29.749 --> 00:05:29.759 
was able to get it ok metals i find

00:05:29.759 --> 00:05:32.270 
was able to get it ok metals i find
to<00:05:29.849> be<00:05:29.940> pretty<00:05:30.240> unforgiving<00:05:30.960> if<00:05:31.860> you<00:05:32.009> try<00:05:32.219> to

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:32.280 
to be pretty unforgiving if you try to

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:34.219 
to be pretty unforgiving if you try to
do<00:05:32.490> them<00:05:32.669> this<00:05:33.000> bright<00:05:33.389> if<00:05:33.690> you<00:05:33.840> try<00:05:33.990> to<00:05:34.020> do

00:05:34.219 --> 00:05:34.229 
do them this bright if you try to do

00:05:34.229 --> 00:05:35.899 
do them this bright if you try to do
them<00:05:34.380> something<00:05:34.680> like<00:05:34.710> an<00:05:34.979> orc<00:05:35.219> e<00:05:35.370> metal<00:05:35.759> where

00:05:35.899 --> 00:05:35.909 
them something like an orc e metal where

00:05:35.909 --> 00:05:38.089 
them something like an orc e metal where
it's<00:05:36.060> lots<00:05:36.240> of<00:05:36.449> dark<00:05:36.990> colors<00:05:37.380> and<00:05:37.650> rusts<00:05:37.979> and

00:05:38.089 --> 00:05:38.099 
it's lots of dark colors and rusts and

00:05:38.099 --> 00:05:39.649 
it's lots of dark colors and rusts and
washes<00:05:38.550> then<00:05:38.729> it's<00:05:38.880> a<00:05:39.120> bit<00:05:39.539> more

00:05:39.649 --> 00:05:39.659 
washes then it's a bit more

00:05:39.659 --> 00:05:41.480 
washes then it's a bit more
straightforward<00:05:40.259> but<00:05:40.440> trying<00:05:41.039> to<00:05:41.130> do<00:05:41.190> a<00:05:41.250> nice

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:41.490 
straightforward but trying to do a nice

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:44.209 
straightforward but trying to do a nice
shiny<00:05:41.849> sort<00:05:42.779> of<00:05:42.900> kind<00:05:43.319> of<00:05:43.409> warm<00:05:43.650> but<00:05:43.979> also

00:05:44.209 --> 00:05:44.219 
shiny sort of kind of warm but also

00:05:44.219 --> 00:05:46.399 
shiny sort of kind of warm but also
pretty<00:05:44.520> new<00:05:44.759> looking<00:05:45.150> not<00:05:45.599> to<00:05:45.750> tarnished<00:05:46.259> its

00:05:46.399 --> 00:05:46.409 
pretty new looking not to tarnished its

00:05:46.409 --> 00:05:51.219 
pretty new looking not to tarnished its
to<00:05:47.130> be<00:05:47.219> tricky<00:05:48.110> the<00:05:49.110> the<00:05:49.440> flying<00:05:49.740> stem<00:05:50.099> here

00:05:51.219 --> 00:05:51.229 
to be tricky the the flying stem here

00:05:51.229 --> 00:05:53.120 
to be tricky the the flying stem here
unfortunately<00:05:52.229> it's<00:05:52.349> not<00:05:52.380> quite<00:05:52.770> the<00:05:52.800> same<00:05:52.919> as

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:53.130 
unfortunately it's not quite the same as

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:55.309 
unfortunately it's not quite the same as
the<00:05:53.430> clear<00:05:53.699> ones<00:05:53.909> the<00:05:54.210> games<00:05:54.750> workshop<00:05:55.080> makes

00:05:55.309 --> 00:05:55.319 
the clear ones the games workshop makes
