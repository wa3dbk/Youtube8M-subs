00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:12.630
 of pork pass orlov accompanied 200 to 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:17.990
 baked rice to start counting 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:21.260
 for 4 people 1 kilo of roast orlov 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:27.570
 250 g mushrooms from paris 

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:29.730
 200 g of cherry tomatoes 200 g of rice I 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.380
 recommends you basmati rice because it has 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.829
 much more taste and get married 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:38.480
 perfectly with the roast pork from 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:42.320
 basil parsley and garlic powder 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:46.829
 pepper salt and a bouillon cube 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:50.550
 and to finish an onion in a big 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:57.960
 dish preferably towards I start 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:01:00.030
 to put my roast well in the center then 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.960
 I will add my onions that I have 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.960
 cut in four 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:14.780
 and I add my little cherry tomatoes 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:14.780
 that I have all around the roast 

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:24.230
 like this 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:30.310
 I add the whole mushrooms so I 

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:30.310
 always has everything around my roast 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:36.490
 I add salt and pepper 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:48.130
 as well as garlic parsley and basil 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:03.990
 I recommend you add a whole 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.600
 little bit of fat for 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:09.000
 avoid the roast hanging on the bottom of the 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.130
 flat so to choose is oil 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.680
 olive is a knob of butter 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:16.020
 so I chose the olive oil that 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.720
 brings an extra flavor 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:24.750
 so I just smear the 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:27.570
 above my roast like these to 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:33.270

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:36.360
 half an hour in the oven thermostat 6 210 Â° 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:38.970
 and only after half an hour I 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:44.520
 would add my broth and ripen in 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:47.210
 cooking half an hour later I'm going 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:51.060

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:53.430
 as well as 200 milliliters of water and I 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:56.700

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:37.230
 that all my grains of rice are found 

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:39.690

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:49.260
