between the dollar and gold has always

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.820 
between the dollar and gold has always
been<00:02:08.879> an<00:02:09.000> inverse<00:02:09.330> one<00:02:09.599> so<00:02:09.810> we<00:02:10.080> expect<00:02:10.379> gold<00:02:10.679> to

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
been an inverse one so we expect gold to

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:11.990
