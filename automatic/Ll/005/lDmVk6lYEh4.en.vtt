thing I've made this apple pie quite a
few<00:00:23.220> times<00:00:23.400> before<00:00:24.560> only<00:00:25.560> succeeded<00:00:26.039> once<00:00:26.279> but

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
few times before only succeeded once but

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.220 
few times before only succeeded once but
now<00:00:26.970> that<00:00:27.150> I<00:00:27.180> know<00:00:27.269> the<00:00:27.359> crust<00:00:27.750> is<00:00:27.840> going<00:00:28.080> to<00:00:28.140> be

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
now that I know the crust is going to be

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.099 
now that I know the crust is going to be
awesome<00:00:28.410> the<00:00:29.070> feeling<00:00:29.429> just<00:00:29.550> has<00:00:29.760> to<00:00:29.939> be<00:00:30.119> up<00:00:30.720> to

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
awesome the feeling just has to be up to

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.420 
awesome the feeling just has to be up to
par<00:00:31.140> I<00:00:31.710> guess<00:00:32.099> oh<00:00:32.719> yeah<00:00:33.719> I<00:00:34.020> didn't<00:00:34.559> split<00:00:35.040> the

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
par I guess oh yeah I didn't split the

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.370 
par I guess oh yeah I didn't split the
pie<00:00:35.670> crust<00:00:35.719> evenly<00:00:36.719> this<00:00:36.989> one<00:00:37.230> is

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
pie crust evenly this one is

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.709 
pie crust evenly this one is
significantly<00:00:38.129> thicker<00:00:38.489> than<00:00:38.790> this<00:00:39.030> role<00:00:39.510> of

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
significantly thicker than this role of

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.389 
significantly thicker than this role of
your<00:00:39.870> pie<00:00:40.050> dough<00:00:40.110> with<00:00:40.590> the<00:00:40.620> cling<00:00:40.950> film<00:00:40.980> on

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
your pie dough with the cling film on

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.000 
your pie dough with the cling film on
onto<00:00:42.270> this<00:00:42.420> map<00:00:42.629> because<00:00:43.290> then<00:00:43.500> you<00:00:43.649> can<00:00:43.829> just

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
onto this map because then you can just

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.660 
onto this map because then you can just
invert<00:00:44.579> this<00:00:44.879> into<00:00:45.719> the<00:00:46.140> pan<00:00:46.710> if<00:00:47.129> you<00:00:47.370> break

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
invert this into the pan if you break
