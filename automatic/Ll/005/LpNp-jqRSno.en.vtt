two<00:01:57.750> Mozingo<00:01:58.110> Z's<00:01:58.500> like<00:01:59.189> I<00:01:59.369> do<00:01:59.869> ones<00:02:00.869> that<00:02:01.020> Shin

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
two Mozingo Z's like I do ones that Shin

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.440 
two Mozingo Z's like I do ones that Shin
Mazinger<00:02:01.710> Z<00:02:01.890> ones<00:02:02.250> they're<00:02:02.460> regular<00:02:02.790> so<00:02:03.329> we're

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
Mazinger Z ones they're regular so we're

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.510 
Mazinger Z ones they're regular so we're
going<00:02:03.540> to<00:02:03.600> put<00:02:03.869> the<00:02:04.020> rocket<00:02:04.350> punch<00:02:04.799> on<00:02:05.070> both<00:02:05.310> of

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
going to put the rocket punch on both of

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.809 
going to put the rocket punch on both of
them<00:02:05.670> so<00:02:07.009> before<00:02:08.009> we<00:02:08.099> do<00:02:08.220> the<00:02:08.310> screener<00:02:08.580> let's

you don't have to buy a second set I

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:12.600 
you don't have to buy a second set I
guess<00:03:11.470> they<00:03:11.650> were<00:03:11.709> already<00:03:11.980> planning<00:03:12.370> on

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:12.610 
guess they were already planning on

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:15.000 
guess they were already planning on
releasing<00:03:12.790> this<00:03:13.180> guy<00:03:13.420> or<00:03:13.690> they<00:03:14.590> were<00:03:14.650> planning

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.010 
releasing this guy or they were planning

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:17.880 
releasing this guy or they were planning
on<00:03:15.070> you<00:03:15.250> having<00:03:15.580> multiple<00:03:16.540> ones<00:03:16.690> so<00:03:17.590> there<00:03:17.769> you

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:17.890 
on you having multiple ones so there you

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:19.710 
on you having multiple ones so there you
go<00:03:18.040> so<00:03:18.850> you'll<00:03:19.060> see<00:03:19.209> it's<00:03:19.360> a<00:03:19.480> pretty

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720 
go so you'll see it's a pretty

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:21.030 
go so you'll see it's a pretty
convincing<00:03:20.110> rocket<00:03:20.739> punch<00:03:20.860> effect

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 
convincing rocket punch effect

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:22.620 
convincing rocket punch effect
especially<00:03:21.430> if<00:03:21.820> you're<00:03:22.060> doing<00:03:22.390> it<00:03:22.480> as<00:03:22.600> a

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:22.630 
especially if you're doing it as a

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:24.150 
especially if you're doing it as a
photograph<00:03:23.110> but<00:03:23.290> if<00:03:23.380> you're<00:03:23.470> just<00:03:23.590> moving<00:03:23.950> it

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:24.160 
photograph but if you're just moving it

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:25.320 
photograph but if you're just moving it
around<00:03:24.250> like<00:03:24.459> this<00:03:24.640> it<00:03:24.820> kind<00:03:24.910> of<00:03:25.000> looks<00:03:25.180> weird

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:25.330 
around like this it kind of looks weird

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:28.500 
around like this it kind of looks weird
so<00:03:25.900> overall<00:03:26.320> a<00:03:26.650> very<00:03:26.680> very<00:03:27.580> cool<00:03:27.880> effect<00:03:28.030> for

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
so overall a very very cool effect for

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:29.880 
so overall a very very cool effect for
these<00:03:28.630> figures<00:03:29.019> I<00:03:29.050> just<00:03:29.410> love<00:03:29.590> the<00:03:29.680> way<00:03:29.769> it

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:29.890 
these figures I just love the way it

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:32.100 
these figures I just love the way it
looks<00:03:30.070> now<00:03:30.400> this<00:03:31.060> takes<00:03:31.300> up<00:03:31.450> a<00:03:31.510> lot<00:03:31.630> of<00:03:31.660> display

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:32.110 
looks now this takes up a lot of display

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:33.870 
looks now this takes up a lot of display
area<00:03:32.440> so<00:03:32.650> you<00:03:32.709> might<00:03:32.920> want<00:03:33.100> to<00:03:33.130> think<00:03:33.310> twice<00:03:33.400> if

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:33.880 
area so you might want to think twice if

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.720 
area so you might want to think twice if
you<00:03:33.970> have<00:03:34.150> very<00:03:34.930> little<00:03:35.200> display<00:03:35.920> area<00:03:36.220> but<00:03:36.700> I

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:36.730 
you have very little display area but I

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:40.410 
you have very little display area but I
think<00:03:37.000> the<00:03:37.090> set<00:03:37.390> really<00:03:38.070> shines<00:03:39.239> because<00:03:40.239> of

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:40.420 
think the set really shines because of

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:42.270 
think the set really shines because of
the<00:03:40.570> scrander<00:03:40.989> set<00:03:41.350> I<00:03:41.500> mean<00:03:41.680> obviously<00:03:41.890> this

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:42.280 
the scrander set I mean obviously this

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:44.790 
the scrander set I mean obviously this
affects<00:03:42.640> piece<00:03:42.880> is<00:03:43.060> great<00:03:43.360> but<00:03:44.050> you<00:03:44.709> know

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:44.800 
affects piece is great but you know

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:47.070 
affects piece is great but you know
display<00:03:45.160> wise<00:03:45.370> it<00:03:45.640> does<00:03:45.790> take<00:03:46.000> up<00:03:46.120> a<00:03:46.209> lot<00:03:46.450> not

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:47.080 
display wise it does take up a lot not

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:49.620 
display wise it does take up a lot not
that<00:03:47.230> this<00:03:47.350> grandeur<00:03:47.800> doesn't<00:03:48.250> but<00:03:48.880> you<00:03:49.510> know

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:49.630 
that this grandeur doesn't but you know

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:52.320 
that this grandeur doesn't but you know
kind<00:03:49.989> of<00:03:50.050> need<00:03:50.290> it<00:03:50.470> for<00:03:50.680> Mazinger<00:03:51.250> Z<00:03:51.489> so<00:03:52.239> we're

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:52.330 
kind of need it for Mazinger Z so we're

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:53.430 
kind of need it for Mazinger Z so we're
going<00:03:52.420> to<00:03:52.480> go<00:03:52.600> ahead<00:03:52.780> and<00:03:52.959> attach<00:03:53.230> everything

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:53.440 
going to go ahead and attach everything

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:57.750 
going to go ahead and attach everything

rocket punch effect there and kind of

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:22.159 
rocket punch effect there and kind of
have<00:05:20.729> to<00:05:20.819> lean<00:05:20.970> them<00:05:21.120> back<00:05:21.270> just<00:05:21.780> so<00:05:21.900> you<00:05:21.960> can

00:05:22.159 --> 00:05:22.169 
have to lean them back just so you can

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:23.600 
have to lean them back just so you can
balance<00:05:22.349> and<00:05:22.740> you'll<00:05:22.830> see<00:05:22.979> this<00:05:23.069> gigantic

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:23.610 
balance and you'll see this gigantic

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:25.640 
balance and you'll see this gigantic
rocket<00:05:24.000> punch<00:05:24.360> is<00:05:24.509> going<00:05:24.780> up<00:05:24.900> into<00:05:25.110> the<00:05:25.199> air<00:05:25.380> so

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:25.650 
rocket punch is going up into the air so

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:28.459 
rocket punch is going up into the air so
I<00:05:26.039> think<00:05:26.550> the<00:05:26.849> set<00:05:27.150> is<00:05:27.330> actually<00:05:27.630> really<00:05:28.169> cool

00:05:28.459 --> 00:05:28.469 
I think the set is actually really cool

00:05:28.469 --> 00:05:30.320 
I think the set is actually really cool
and<00:05:28.650> it<00:05:28.710> does<00:05:28.889> come<00:05:29.130> with<00:05:29.159> I'm<00:05:30.060> not<00:05:30.180> gonna
