00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.830
 use for many things is very very of the use 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.930
 of the people of the Mediterranean of Europe and 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.490
 we are rarely here in Mexico are 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.830
 coming already a lot by societies was 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.529
 I'm putting this we can find you 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.450
 in any super is really a corn 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.840
 if you do not find it ground you can 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:39.840
 do and it's stick corn but final grind 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.700
 a fine pound exactly that is you do 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.590
 Well, if you want we put the water here 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.710
 we have for children neither child nor child 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.510
 popcorn not good but the loaves of 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.990
 corn and all that is Ã¡lex goes out with the 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.360
 audio about the version 

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:54.370
 and the taste is rich the truth I think what 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:56.260
 try, I think, insert them 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:57.910
 they are very easy, it will help us a lot 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:00.160
 that these cakes do not go very well ok 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:01.960
 let's start doing it right now 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:05.200
 Mommy sauce that mom is expected more 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:06.730
 is about half the blueberries are not 

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:09.790
 I'm going to put all of the hole in that 

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:11.140
 because this one lets him cook a lot and 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:13.180
 I want you to have like a cookie and 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:15.400
 then I'm going to winnow these newbery 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:18.490

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:34.450
 I want to tell you that the way to do it 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:36.310
 is to put milk and a few drops of lemon 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:38.320
