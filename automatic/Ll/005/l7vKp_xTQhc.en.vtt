00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 so that but again I want 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.560
 apologize because he had said he was going to 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:09.389
 upload a video about google drive in 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.490
 a new section that was going to start that 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:12.840
 it's called applications that come 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.969
 predetermined in our smartphone 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.890
 that we do not use what I'm going to do for 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:20.119
 be next week I leave the 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.119
 play station emulator 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.439
 in the description of the video I will leave 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:28.490
 the link to download the file also 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:30.500
 I'm going to leave the link so they can 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:32.630
 and install android zip so they can 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.280
 unzip it and mega so they can 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:36.190
 download it 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:40.280
 once we have the file 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:43.160
 downloaded we will look like this folder 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:46.129
 we will decompress it, I will not 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:47.860
 I'm going to be realistic because it weighs a little and 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:49.700
 it takes 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:52.310
 much 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:57.400
 we go to the folder and Androids 

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:57.400
 playstation and we install the emulator 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:08.650
 we open it we will appear the 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:10.930
 emulator clauses we put and ok 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:14.700
 from here 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:14.700
 you have to configure the bios 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:23.100
 let's go to 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.100
 system configurations and charge of god 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:28.990
 in charge of videos we are going to dedicate 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:31.080
 android zip 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:34.020
 Play Station 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:37.310
 and we put the billos then we have to 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:40.290
 configure our screen we are going to 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.940
 touch screen and you have to mark all 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:47.120
 these two little buttons from the 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:47.120
 button two or three button 4 to 7 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:55.370
 we can also get some keyboard 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:59.140
 physical if we have a control 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:02:02.770
 with a cable or knit that has 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:05.979
 connection either by usb or by bluetooth 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:08.679
 we can also do it we mark each 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:11.709
 one of the buttons and we press the 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:14.380
 buttons of our control we go back to 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:15.760
 system and I recommend that you keep 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.010
 the configuration so they do not have to 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.770
 be configuring it as long as 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:24.160
 open good and after here we have 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:25.810
 to decompress the games 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:29.230
 I already have to fulfill it also 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:32.740
 game because being a little heavy and 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:35.100
 As good as I said, there's 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:35.100
 do 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:41.580
 another type d 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:44.690
 format must be in bing or start to 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.690
 that we can play it 

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:50.580
 we are going to dedicate android zip x the 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:55.610
 game 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:55.610
 also the juices weigh something are 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:05.140
 160 megs to 750 megabytes there are games by 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:09.030
 can they be two discs this can us 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:09.030
 take a little more memory 

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:54.719
 at the moment we decide we can 

00:03:52.139 --> 00:03:58.079
 save it by simply reading is not a 

00:03:54.719 --> 00:04:01.260
 these three little dots and save is not going to 

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:03.110
 appear five empty spaces we keep 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:05.660
 in some 

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:09.020
 and when you start over, the only thing 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:12.080
 you have to do is go to load and go 

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:13.970
 to always be in the place where 

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:16.220
 I wanted to be 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:18.530
 and also you will be able to save through 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:21.500
 of a virtual memory you choose where 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:23.330
 you want this memory to go to a 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:28.070
 specific folder and can 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:29.540
 back it up so it's in the moment 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:32.840
 that you decide to change to another smartphone 

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:35.090
 you decide to change, I do not know how to eliminate the 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:37.310
 game for X or Y reason do not lose 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:40.550
 this advance that you already had is very simple 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:43.120
 you go to settings you're going to 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:44.710
 and in put 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:48.070
 the lie 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:50.740
 you go to the system and what do you think of a copy? 

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:53.090
 security of all the files to the 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:54.720
 sd card 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:57.660
 come out 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:59.070
 same here this direct safe where 

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:01.380
 you want each of the 

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:03.600
 memory cards and one and two as well as 

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:06.180
 in the playstation and that's where you're going to be able 

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:08.820
 keep it good this on my part if I 

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:11.190
 liked the video subscribe if the hand 

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:13.550
 above the dislike if you did not like it 

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:15.900
 I am also to see your suggestions 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:19.320
 have comments leave less in the 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:22.150
