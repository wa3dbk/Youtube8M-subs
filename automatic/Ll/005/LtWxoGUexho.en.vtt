00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.370 
killed you cannot be shot at and you
know<00:01:05.339> it's<00:01:05.580> very<00:01:05.880> hard<00:01:06.180> to<00:01:06.479> get<00:01:06.689> you<00:01:06.869> out<00:01:07.080> of<00:01:07.110> it

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
know it's very hard to get you out of it

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.109 
know it's very hard to get you out of it
unless<00:01:07.560> they<00:01:07.830> physically<00:01:08.250> go<00:01:08.520> in<00:01:08.729> there<00:01:09.000> to

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
unless they physically go in there to

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.390 
unless they physically go in there to
kill<00:01:09.390> you<00:01:09.600> so<00:01:09.869> it's<00:01:10.290> very<00:01:10.560> useful<00:01:10.860> I<00:01:11.220> mean

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
kill you so it's very useful I mean

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.800 
kill you so it's very useful I mean
there's<00:01:11.610> no<00:01:11.820> way<00:01:12.090> that<00:01:12.390> you<00:01:12.510> could<00:01:12.659> possibly

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
there's no way that you could possibly

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.899 
there's no way that you could possibly
lose<00:01:13.320> the<00:01:13.560> game<00:01:13.710> unless<00:01:14.040> somebody<00:01:14.430> who's<00:01:14.700> not

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
lose the game unless somebody who's not

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.240 
lose the game unless somebody who's not
very<00:01:14.970> smart<00:01:15.509> or<00:01:15.689> bright<00:01:15.960> is<00:01:16.680> actually<00:01:17.100> holding

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
very smart or bright is actually holding

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.460 
very smart or bright is actually holding
the<00:01:17.460> ball<00:01:17.640> so<00:01:18.330> you<00:01:18.869> know<00:01:18.990> basically<00:01:19.200> you

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
the ball so you know basically you

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:20.810 
the ball so you know basically you
wouldn't<00:01:19.680> get<00:01:19.770> into<00:01:19.890> this<00:01:20.070> building<00:01:20.549> over

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
wouldn't get into this building over

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.520 
wouldn't get into this building over
here<00:01:20.850> where<00:01:21.270> red<00:01:21.450> team<00:01:21.630> spawns<00:01:22.020> like<00:01:22.229> I<00:01:22.320> said

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
here where red team spawns like I said

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:23.749 
here where red team spawns like I said
you<00:01:22.680> wouldn't<00:01:22.740> get<00:01:22.950> some<00:01:23.130> people<00:01:23.430> guarding

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
you wouldn't get some people guarding

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.270 
you wouldn't get some people guarding
you<00:01:24.090> and<00:01:24.330> you<00:01:25.049> want<00:01:25.259> to<00:01:25.409> basically<00:01:25.590> look<00:01:26.070> where
