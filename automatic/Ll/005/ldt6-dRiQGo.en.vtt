00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.950
 we're going goodbye frederic mozart 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.110
 to do tonight how to choose a canvas 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.420
 rather how to choose the format of a 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.100
 canvas will answer this question 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.050
 as if you were going into our 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.700
 store and you said you pine jean 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.560
 but I do not know which format I chose 

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:24.360
 am a little lost then there are some 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.619
 beds so we'll see together we'll talk 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:28.050
 that of today we talk about the 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.780
 quality of the paintings another time then 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.489
 first European European formats 

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:33.600
 very often there is a man who indicates 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.820
 the European format 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.430
 and then it is easy to remember it's 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.840
 squares and rectangles with lengths 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.729
 or rib width and that have 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.640
 dimensions that are multiples of 10 

00:00:41.729 --> 00:00:47.850
 cm simply 10 out of 10 20 out of 20 to 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.559
 30 over five years 50 out of 100 120 out of 60 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.970
 it's defending a European because 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.650
 it is the star found in all 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:53.670
 europe all over the world since 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:55.379
 you will see that they form a French 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.830
 bandÃ©s finds that in France the reform a 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.920
 European 

00:00:55.830 --> 00:01:00.089
 well it's all you want 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.129
 found in all dimensions 

00:01:00.089 --> 00:01:03.839
 in all qualities and in 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.479
 especially the entry-level qualities 

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:08.190
 qualities of a port are manufactured 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.659
 only in its forms at the very end 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:11.640
 very often a lot more often in 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.050
 these formats and you will be able 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.730
 find according to what you have 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:16.620
 as a project or as posing 

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:18.180
 reproduction of a format that pretty much 

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:19.260
 equivalent so be not too demanding 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.990
 because again it's all the 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.230
 10 cm roughly that the dimensions of 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.110
 exchange 

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:26.010
 this is for women a European 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:29.340
 now french formats then 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:30.360
 as its name says it's a 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.190
 French exception 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.560
 we are used to these formats because 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:36.510
 that in fact in museums we see 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.670
 figures of marine landscapes that 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:41.910
 are who respects these proportions there to 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:44.250
 the origin of the multiples of the golden ratio 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:48.420
 but leave this little topic aside 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:51.360
 remembered that f means landscape rhdp 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.920
 m marine and so you're going to have a 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.080
 little figure behind who follows to the ass 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.390
 precede the f the plm which tell you 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.950
 the proportion actually of the painting that is going 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.400
 go crescendo gradually as we 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.640
 lie 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:05.040
 if you have an original model that 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.110
 is finally pay for example some 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.670
 proportions that respects levante you 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.170
 will be able to reproduce it with 12 p 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.819
 you will have the same proportions 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.470
 it's interesting to know of the same 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:14.670
 way for the marines or for 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.010
 figures f 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.420
 so this is the most not the most format 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.730
 calm and that comes closest to a 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.200
 rectangle a little fleshed out to see 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.220
 figures simply you are entitled 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.319
 to put it in the opposite direction of course 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:28.020
 to paint everything you want f 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:30.510
 the p as landscape is a bit more 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:33.030
 lying a little more stretched on having 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:35.819
 the same great distances as the ass 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:37.200
 here and the navy even more elongated 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:38.730
 for down to take what you 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.430
 want but in particular decorations 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:44.250
 but here we go, we've done pretty much 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:46.440
 the turn so remember well fpm 3 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.690
 proportion that will increase in 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:51.930
 function of the number of the great battle 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:52.980
 the number following this format prefix 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.050
 French movement you will not find 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:56.459
 nowhere else in any other 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:58.170
 country no one manufactures who have bread on 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:00.540
 these formats there and then the formats and 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.980
 European society finds everywhere and who 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:03.030
 times to a few centimeters so 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.620
 even closer to formats 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.600
 French a little bit found its equivalent 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:09.630
 but that are intended for an audience and a 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:11.040
 world market here thank you very much 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:12.540
 thank you for your attention you do not 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.640
