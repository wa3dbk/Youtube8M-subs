let's<00:02:21.220> talk<00:02:21.400> about<00:02:21.610> a<00:02:22.000> little<00:02:22.330> bit<00:02:22.540> about

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
let's talk about a little bit about

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:24.360 
let's talk about a little bit about
what's<00:02:23.110> in<00:02:23.290> here<00:02:23.470> just<00:02:23.769> so<00:02:23.860> that<00:02:23.890> way<00:02:24.099> you<00:02:24.220> guys

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
can have an understanding so the error

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:28.619 
can have an understanding so the error
41<00:02:26.260> has<00:02:26.410> finally<00:02:26.709> been<00:02:26.830> fixed<00:02:27.280> it<00:02:28.030> apparently

00:03:56.309 --> 00:03:56.319 
shortcuts so taking some cuts in the

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:58.110 
shortcuts so taking some cuts in the
rally<00:03:56.530> is<00:03:56.739> cool<00:03:56.950> but<00:03:57.310> these<00:03:57.549> cuts<00:03:57.880> was

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:58.120 
rally is cool but these cuts was

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:00.479 
rally is cool but these cuts was
definitely<00:03:58.750> not<00:03:59.019> cool<00:03:59.440> so<00:03:59.919> they<00:04:00.040> were<00:04:00.099> taking

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:00.489 
definitely not cool so they were taking

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:01.949 
definitely not cool so they were taking
some<00:04:00.639> major<00:04:00.880> shortcuts<00:04:01.419> so<00:04:01.569> they<00:04:01.690> went<00:04:01.840> ahead

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:01.959 
some major shortcuts so they went ahead

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:04.680 
some major shortcuts so they went ahead
