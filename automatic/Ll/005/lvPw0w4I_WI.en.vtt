00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:29.090
 authentique game cdsv team sun brought 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:32.180
 for you but the video of molly craft 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:34.580

 Your name is ending. 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:45.860
 basically it adds a 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:48.230
 computer in quotation marks that you 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:50.690
 can teleport to 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:53.030
 basically where you want right? 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:55.339
 remembering if you like microsoft mode 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:57.320
 here on the expensive channel in the description has 

00:00:55.339 --> 00:00:58.909
 a playlist a playlist with 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:01.040
 the best ways I've ever brought 

00:00:58.909 --> 00:01:03.290
 maine craft and then click there for you 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:05.840
 find more deaths for planning its greater 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:08.180
 craft much more fun, huh? 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.830
 Like I said to you, the mold is 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:12.170
 very simple basically what it goes 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:14.119
 add are these three items here that 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:16.369
 is the terminal console transport the 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:18.830
 remote terminal transport and transport 

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:21.980
 chip both the prices of them are 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:24.320
 very easy in most of them you need 

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:26.060
 sell paper then it's because it already does 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.760
 sense in this since we will have to 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:31.700
 transport starting here, not remembering 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:33.710
 that the crashes them I'll leave the 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:36.140
 own topic of the mod case of interest 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:38.720
 is in the description beauty in the dam 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.940
 good thing is you will see that this one 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:43.280
 Terminal console transport so that it 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:46.040
 Serves galley available if as 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:48.770
 it was even in films vallées time of 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:51.200
 fiction itself and by clicking on it 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:53.630
 shows the location where it is in the 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.440
 if x1 let's see if it was accurate 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:57.680
 same 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:59.659
 He did it wrong for one but that's how it is. 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:03.290
 6 goes for two is basically this 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:05.270
 increase 4122 we can see that it is 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:07.940
 identical to it will tell you where to 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:10.129
 let's basically teleport always 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:12.530
 It will be here you will need to have 

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:14.780
 with you also a terminal transport 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.730
 Last rowing is that it is this control here 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.420
 For what it's worth, guys. 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:20.450
 need 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:22.670
 I came here in our computer in case it is 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:25.310
 our console to complete the console and 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:27.620
 put the control here for me what? 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:30.230
 he is basically linking what he is going to 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.230
 link here with our terminal and you 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:33.060
 can see that it will stay 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:35.129
 different right he is showing that 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.500
 always he will see he was carrying lime 

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:38.280
 you can see that the xistra minus 32 and 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.739
 tals 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:44.099
 now basically I can go walk to 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:46.230
 far away dude, I do not know, let's go. 

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:48.959
 see here I come back here in the middle of these 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:52.530
 gasoline waves that desert is a 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:54.150
 idt portal the donnell ink was 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:56.730
 testing it good and I think there is already one 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.590
 Little bit far and I step to power. 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:01.620
 Back there, I just click with the 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:05.010
 button right little came back here 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:07.170
 people are very fast the teleport is him 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:10.290
 It works also to teleport to 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:12.780
 other dimensions man this is very beast 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:15.569
 even good another thing too cool 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:18.329
 he adds here are the chips is 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:20.430
 chip and chip transport is for 

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:22.920
 you mark in some places where 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:25.019
 Do you want to have to carry what looks 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:27.239
 You'll get this chip he has. 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:29.579
 empty of transport and will put in 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:32.099
 of our machine also of our comfort 

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:33.599
 to transport all these places here 

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:37.019
 you can see that these spaces that 

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:38.730
 They're good for the chip that's for you. 

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:40.349
 teleport for you to dial 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:43.109

 be able to dial in after he has left the 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:02.579
 chip inside our console 

00:04:00.389 --> 00:04:04.889
 we'll simply click with the 

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:06.959
 right click, then click 

00:04:04.889 --> 00:04:09.660
