00:00:04.249 --> 00:00:04.259 
dreaming up eco challenges isn't the

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:05.570 
dreaming up eco challenges isn't the
problem<00:00:04.470> because<00:00:04.830> the<00:00:04.920> world<00:00:05.100> is<00:00:05.310> full<00:00:05.520> of

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:05.580 
problem because the world is full of

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.309 
problem because the world is full of
them<00:00:05.790> yeah<00:00:06.029> it's<00:00:06.270> dreaming<00:00:06.660> up<00:00:06.779> eco<00:00:07.109> solutions

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:07.319 
them yeah it's dreaming up eco solutions

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:09.410 
them yeah it's dreaming up eco solutions
that's<00:00:07.980> kind<00:00:08.250> of<00:00:08.309> difficult<00:00:08.490> right<00:00:09.240> and

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
that's kind of difficult right and

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.049 
that's kind of difficult right and
that's<00:00:09.690> where<00:00:09.960> like<00:00:10.559> the<00:00:11.130> Isetta<00:00:11.700> before<00:00:11.969> the

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
that's where like the Isetta before the

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:14.900 
that's where like the Isetta before the
satisfaction<00:00:12.809> came<00:00:12.990> from<00:00:13.219> finding<00:00:14.219> exactly

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
satisfaction came from finding exactly

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.180 
satisfaction came from finding exactly
the<00:00:15.360> right<00:00:15.480> solution<00:00:16.170> to<00:00:16.470> find<00:00:16.650> a<00:00:16.680> fit<00:00:16.920> what

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
the right solution to find a fit what

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:23.090 
the right solution to find a fit what
the<00:00:17.279> people<00:00:17.430> want<00:00:17.670> yeah<00:00:17.789> yeah<00:00:21.740> the<00:00:22.740> planet

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
the people want yeah yeah the planet

have proved to you that this is as good
as<00:00:48.960> that<00:00:48.989> and<00:00:49.649> I've<00:00:49.860> got<00:00:50.100> a<00:00:50.129> suitably

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
as that and I've got a suitably

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.439 
as that and I've got a suitably
agricultural<00:00:51.570> test<00:00:51.899> in<00:00:52.079> mind<00:00:52.320> this<00:00:53.129> right

00:00:53.439 --> 00:00:53.449 
agricultural test in mind this right

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:56.270
