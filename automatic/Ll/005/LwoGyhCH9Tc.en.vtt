00:00:01.069 --> 00:00:05.660
 Petzold from down is coveted and not cheap who as a dealer so many ladies 

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:08.379
 can offer a nice and safe source of money 

00:00:08.379 --> 00:00:12.079
 it's the Geese from the Dawn that stand to benefit but not from 

00:00:12.079 --> 00:00:15.650
 their performance they are the victims actually allowed only the 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:19.600
 Slaughtered animals are rough plucking live animals is strict 

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:21.289
 forbidden 

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:24.319
 Hard to believe there are those who do not stick to it 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:28.029
 why on the trail of animal torturers 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.789
 a small geese farm in the Westphalian Steinfurt 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:35.350
 This limit introduces animal rights activists like Karl Fikuart 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:38.350
 call happy life 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.290
 r and pictures here that have been leaked to us so much in the 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:49.350
 August last year and just the cries of geese has a reason they 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.210
 be threatened alive 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.200
 the so-called lovable 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:57.850
 the motives are clear so the thumbs can be won up to three times a year 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:01.800
 a procedure but that is associated with big risks there are the 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.580
 Animal rights activists certainly 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:07.230
 in addition to top 5 to clearly animal cruelty 

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:11.460
 because life is torn out of the animals' feathers, some of them are not 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.000
 that is to say, the skin is ready to be taken off the skin 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.370
 Those who are only bloody, so they are stuck in the skin are pulled out 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.229
 therefore, only dead animals should be allowed in the EU 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:25.000
 but not everyone sticks to it 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.180
 At the end of June in the yard of the company Schwerk in Lower Saxony 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:30.550
 under the border are plucked alive 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:32.300
 and especially painful 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:35.300
 Here are the fingers crossed with a machine from Boston 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:40.410
 The scandal was uncovered by a coworker of the Tierschutzverein four 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:41.190
 paws 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:44.220
 For fear of revenge he wants to keep his name secret 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:49.360
 These are machines that are actually intended for dead animals in the slaughterhouse 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:52.010
 accordingly, no feelings whatsoever have been felt on the animals 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:56.180
 Consideration these machines were used un-member because of people 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:58.580
 to produce many feathers 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:01.810
 the owner of the Geese farm refused an interview 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:03.440
 only in writing he shared 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:07.210
 that the intervention was made for medical reasons quote 

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:11.949
 Geese are not plucked alive in my recordings 

00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:15.699
 Sucking out for a short while Rich Fed at the look of my therapeutic 

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:18.699
 investigate 

00:02:19.999 --> 00:02:21.449
 medical reasons 

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:26.069
 naked nonsense my investigation no investigation justify the habitat 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:30.750
 that really happens on goosebumps tells us a previous one 

00:02:30.749 --> 00:02:31.649
 Employee 

00:02:31.649 --> 00:02:36.059
 These pot machines are pretty brutal four feet a motor in the middle of the 

00:02:36.059 --> 00:02:38.659
 Slices and behind the mountain with flew 

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:43.319
 the goose legs like crazy in the end they are bloodily pulled away and the skin 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:47.040
 It does not look nice to let it cut your hair like that 

00:02:48.109 --> 00:02:50.180
 the first consequence of the incidents 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.409
 the veterinary office withdrew the permission to the company boss 

00:02:53.409 --> 00:02:57.489
 According to media reports, however, another family member continued 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:00.559
 the prosecutor investigates animal cruelty 

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:03.569
 what comes out the back is very difficult to predict 

00:03:04.219 --> 00:03:05.479
 and the steering wheel 

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:10.239
 how hard the 4 4 ​​4 to 4 o'clock like that happened but basically this 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:12.849
 Form of punishment high so 

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:14.189
 while imprisonment 

00:03:14.189 --> 00:03:17.799
 For the consumer, the question arises whether he is buying a thorn hedge 

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:20.359
 supports such animal cruelty 

00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:23.559
 Much of the down in Germany is for clothing pillows or 

00:03:23.559 --> 00:03:28.169
 Ceilings to be processed are imported mainly from Eastern Europe 

00:03:28.169 --> 00:03:30.480
 and China in these countries 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.070
 Ohlen ensnares China 

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:36.590
 IZ life squad is completely normal even though Eichin is banned in the EU 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:38.639
 eu-states Poland and Hungary 

00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:41.940
 handled everywhere with actually all geese stocks 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:45.390
 So you can assume that if my percentage wants to hear I go away 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:49.010
 that 80 percent of goods from these countries come from every pot 

00:03:49.999 --> 00:03:53.649
 we have asked the German Association of Down and Feather Industry 

00:03:54.509 --> 00:03:59.869
 The manager believes that 98 percent of the tax revenue came from the dead 

00:03:59.869 --> 00:04:02.009
 Geese are from 

00:04:02.009 --> 00:04:04.369
 a best pitcher at Chrysler where she buys 

00:04:04.369 --> 00:04:08.019
 and what she buys and these are usually professionals 

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:12.139
 because the Airboard is sure it has a pretty well executed 

00:04:12.139 --> 00:04:16.609
 if the hiding place on life then it can be documented and documented 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:17.749
 become 

00:04:17.749 --> 00:04:20.979
 but the Federal Veterinarians see that quite differently 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:24.060
 at the moment 11 would 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:28.460
 Percent do not assume that the ways really backtracked 

00:04:29.569 --> 00:04:33.039
 if for that are too many complicated merchant ships 

00:04:33.039 --> 00:04:35.349
 Intermediate processing steps 

00:04:35.349 --> 00:04:36.370
 because she is here 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:40.760
 In Germany someone will get washed goods from there are the 

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:42.120
 Main track wonder 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:45.009
 washed out in the truest sense of the word 

00:04:45.009 --> 00:04:48.110
 So it can not be determined if the ladies from his 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:50.000
 Life Roberto stalactites 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.440
 The farmers' association has to give that too and is counting on the future for the future 

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:55.889
 researcher 

00:04:55.889 --> 00:04:58.050
 how can I as a regret of the Danes 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:03.030
 that does not look honest Levent Rupf thus won by improper head 

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:07.479
 and there scientific research will be necessary there already 

00:05:07.479 --> 00:05:11.310
 a few percent, but how fast the scientists are 

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:13.259
 we do not know 

00:05:13.259 --> 00:05:15.169
 until the science is ready 

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:18.169
 the consumer needs to live with the uncertainty 

00:05:18.789 --> 00:05:22.539
 if I buy a blanket in particular to rush 

00:05:22.539 --> 00:05:24.919
 unusually low price 

00:05:24.919 --> 00:05:29.600
 With errors of goods weeks undetected or pillows or what to all 

00:05:29.599 --> 00:05:33.979
 Freuler price if you like it then I may radio relay wrong 

00:05:33.979 --> 00:05:39.379
 that it also plucked for live the feathers and down trade the 

00:05:39.379 --> 00:05:41.110
 in these guides 

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:45.820
 Who wants to save the animals so at least a few euros more for his 

00:05:45.819 --> 00:05:47.189
 spend good sleep 

00:05:47.189 --> 00:05:50.549
 so that more geese stand a chance of welfare 

00:05:52.779 --> 00:05:56.270
 that was in addition to pictures Debstedter were enduring but 

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:58.690
 Nevertheless, we decided to show
