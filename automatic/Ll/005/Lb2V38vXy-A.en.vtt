they'll<00:01:43.950> turn<00:01:44.130> around<00:01:44.250> you<00:01:44.670> can<00:01:44.820> sneak<00:01:45.000> up

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
they'll turn around you can sneak up

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.060 
they'll turn around you can sneak up
behind<00:01:45.210> them<00:01:45.659> so<00:01:46.380> here<00:01:46.590> I<00:01:46.619> was<00:01:46.740> hoping<00:01:46.860> for

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
behind them so here I was hoping for

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.950 
behind them so here I was hoping for
this<00:01:47.280> guy<00:01:47.430> to<00:01:47.490> walk<00:01:47.759> under<00:01:48.060> this<00:01:48.210> gargoyle<00:01:48.689> so

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
this guy to walk under this gargoyle so

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.139 
this guy to walk under this gargoyle so
I<00:01:49.020> could<00:01:49.200> get<00:01:49.530> an<00:01:49.710> inverted<00:01:50.130> takedown<00:01:50.520> but<00:01:51.060> he

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
I could get an inverted takedown but he

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.210 
I could get an inverted takedown but he
stopped<00:01:51.509> and<00:01:51.869> it<00:01:52.200> really<00:01:52.380> mess<00:01:52.590> up<00:01:52.619> my<00:01:52.890> plans

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
stopped and it really mess up my plans

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.850 
stopped and it really mess up my plans
so<00:01:53.520> instead<00:01:54.299> of<00:01:54.390> rushing<00:01:54.780> it<00:01:54.930> I<00:01:55.110> just<00:01:55.350> go<00:01:55.680> ahead

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
so instead of rushing it I just go ahead

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.560 
so instead of rushing it I just go ahead
and<00:01:56.009> wait<00:01:56.159> because<00:01:56.399> the<00:01:56.909> guy<00:01:57.030> in<00:01:57.180> the<00:01:57.270> middle

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
and wait because the guy in the middle

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
many people it's I don't think two more

many people it's I don't think two more
or<00:02:47.320> too<00:02:47.530> many<00:02:47.680> more<00:02:47.830> people<00:02:48.190> than<00:02:48.340> two<00:02:48.550> will<00:02:48.760> be

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
or too many more people than two will be

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.660 
or too many more people than two will be
grouped<00:02:49.300> up<00:02:49.450> together<00:02:50.070> so<00:02:51.070> I've<00:02:51.370> got<00:02:51.550> it

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 
grouped up together so I've got it

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:54.240 
grouped up together so I've got it
Windell<00:02:52.120> down<00:02:52.360> to<00:02:52.960> the<00:02:53.230> last<00:02:53.440> two<00:02:53.770> guys<00:02:54.010> I

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
Windell down to the last two guys I

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:56.850 
Windell down to the last two guys I
believe<00:02:54.580> and<00:02:54.910> once<00:02:55.660> I<00:02:55.810> can<00:02:55.990> take<00:02:56.170> out<00:02:56.320> one<00:02:56.380> I

00:02:59.040 --> 00:02:59.050 
don't really worry so much about the

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:01.650 
don't really worry so much about the
other<00:02:59.080> one<00:02:59.410> because<00:03:00.240> right<00:03:01.240> here<00:03:01.270> he<00:03:01.480> goes

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
other one because right here he goes

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:03.810 
other one because right here he goes
right<00:03:01.840> underneath<00:03:02.050> the<00:03:02.230> gargoyle<00:03:02.680> and<00:03:03.130> don't

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:03.820 
right underneath the gargoyle and don't

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:05.310 
right underneath the gargoyle and don't
want<00:03:04.060> to<00:03:04.150> rush<00:03:04.330> it<00:03:04.570> I'm<00:03:04.870> going<00:03:05.050> to<00:03:05.110> go<00:03:05.230> ahead

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:05.320 
want to rush it I'm going to go ahead

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:06.690 
want to rush it I'm going to go ahead
and<00:03:05.470> get<00:03:05.560> my<00:03:05.680> opportunity<00:03:06.160> right<00:03:06.310> here<00:03:06.550> and

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
and get my opportunity right here and

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.550 
and get my opportunity right here and

string them out and very takedowns

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.400 
string them out and very takedowns
tricky<00:03:08.890> because<00:03:09.370> if<00:03:09.760> you<00:03:10.030> do<00:03:10.210> it<00:03:10.360> you<00:03:11.140> can<00:03:11.290> get

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:11.410 
tricky because if you do it you can get

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:13.110 
tricky because if you do it you can get
people<00:03:11.590> to<00:03:11.770> walk<00:03:12.040> over<00:03:12.430> there<00:03:12.580> and<00:03:12.730> set<00:03:12.970> them

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
people to walk over there and set them

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.240 
people to walk over there and set them
up<00:03:13.240> for<00:03:13.270> a<00:03:13.510> takedown<00:03:13.780> later<00:03:14.200> but<00:03:14.890> if<00:03:15.010> they<00:03:15.190> see

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:08.050 
you using a sonic Batarang is really

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:10.140 
you using a sonic Batarang is really
good<00:05:08.259> you<00:05:09.250> want<00:05:09.400> to<00:05:09.460> make<00:05:09.580> sure<00:05:09.610> you<00:05:09.789> throw<00:05:10.030> it

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:10.150

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:14.500 
throw it too close to yourself you can't

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:16.559 
throw it too close to yourself you can't
jump<00:05:14.860> behind<00:05:15.039> them<00:05:15.490> so<00:05:16.120> you<00:05:16.180> want<00:05:16.360> to<00:05:16.479> make

00:05:16.559 --> 00:05:16.569

where<00:05:17.979> you<00:05:18.639> have<00:05:18.789> room<00:05:19.030> to<00:05:19.300> hop<00:05:19.509> down<00:05:19.539> and<00:05:20.110> then

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:20.530 
where you have room to hop down and then

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:22.950 
where you have room to hop down and then
come<00:05:20.800> up<00:05:20.830> and<00:05:21.190> sneak<00:05:21.460> up<00:05:21.610> behind<00:05:21.639> them<00:05:22.090> so<00:05:22.750> here

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:22.960 
come up and sneak up behind them so here

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:24.689 
come up and sneak up behind them so here
I<00:05:22.990> was<00:05:23.139> hoping<00:05:23.530> they<00:05:23.650> would<00:05:23.800> both<00:05:23.979> go<00:05:24.310> to<00:05:24.370> it

00:05:24.689 --> 00:05:24.699 
I was hoping they would both go to it

00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:27.209 
I was hoping they would both go to it
but<00:05:25.150> only<00:05:25.240> one<00:05:25.569> guy<00:05:25.780> did<00:05:26.080> but<00:05:26.710> fortunately

00:05:27.209 --> 00:05:27.219 
but only one guy did but fortunately

00:05:27.219 --> 00:05:29.249 
but only one guy did but fortunately
what<00:05:27.400> they<00:05:27.520> do<00:05:27.580> is<00:05:27.909> they<00:05:28.060> find<00:05:28.300> your<00:05:28.599> sonic

00:05:29.249 --> 00:05:29.259 
what they do is they find your sonic

00:05:29.259 --> 00:05:31.559 
what they do is they find your sonic
Batarang<00:05:29.800> and<00:05:30.009> they<00:05:30.130> smash<00:05:30.669> it<00:05:30.940> it<00:05:31.090> gives<00:05:31.479> you

00:05:31.559 --> 00:05:31.569 
Batarang and they smash it it gives you

00:05:31.569 --> 00:05:33.240 
Batarang and they smash it it gives you
plenty<00:05:31.810> of<00:05:31.960> time<00:05:32.050> to<00:05:32.409> take<00:05:32.620> out<00:05:32.800> two<00:05:33.039> guys

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:33.250 
plenty of time to take out two guys

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:36.629 
plenty of time to take out two guys
separately<00:05:33.909> so<00:05:34.810> here<00:05:35.560> it<00:05:35.620> is<00:05:35.710> I<00:05:35.740> haven't<00:05:36.550> even

00:05:36.629 --> 00:05:36.639 
separately so here it is I haven't even

00:05:36.639 --> 00:05:38.399 
separately so here it is I haven't even
been<00:05:36.880> close<00:05:37.060> to<00:05:37.330> being<00:05:37.539> seen<00:05:37.870> and<00:05:38.110> I've<00:05:38.199> got

00:05:38.399 --> 00:05:38.409 
been close to being seen and I've got

00:05:38.409 --> 00:05:41.249 
been close to being seen and I've got
three<00:05:38.710> guys<00:05:38.919> down<00:05:39.250> I<00:05:39.550> just<00:05:40.479> got<00:05:40.630> a<00:05:40.659> couple<00:05:40.870> left

00:05:41.249 --> 00:05:41.259 
three guys down I just got a couple left

00:05:41.259 --> 00:05:44.309 
three guys down I just got a couple left
so<00:05:41.740> go<00:05:42.699> ahead<00:05:42.819> and<00:05:42.969> I'm<00:05:43.240> swinging<00:05:43.750> around<00:05:44.110> the

00:05:44.309 --> 00:05:44.319 
so go ahead and I'm swinging around the

00:05:44.319 --> 00:05:45.659 
so go ahead and I'm swinging around the
other<00:05:44.409> side<00:05:44.680> of<00:05:44.770> the<00:05:44.830> building<00:05:45.159> so<00:05:45.190> I<00:05:45.370> can<00:05:45.400> get

00:05:45.659 --> 00:05:45.669 
other side of the building so I can get

00:05:45.669 --> 00:05:48.360 
other side of the building so I can get
a<00:05:45.699> better<00:05:45.940> view<00:05:46.210> and<00:05:47.050> what<00:05:47.590> I'm<00:05:47.680> hoping<00:05:47.889> for<00:05:48.130> is

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:48.370 
a better view and what I'm hoping for is

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:50.189 
a better view and what I'm hoping for is
just<00:05:48.729> somebody's<00:05:49.210> walking<00:05:49.630> around<00:05:49.930> maybe

00:05:50.189 --> 00:05:50.199 
just somebody's walking around maybe

00:05:50.199 --> 00:05:52.050 
just somebody's walking around maybe
they<00:05:50.440> found<00:05:50.740> the<00:05:50.919> guy<00:05:51.069> that<00:05:51.279> I<00:05:51.340> dropped<00:05:51.669> and<00:05:51.969> I

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:52.060 
they found the guy that I dropped and I

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:54.930 
they found the guy that I dropped and I
can<00:05:52.240> sneak<00:05:52.419> up<00:05:52.599> behind<00:05:52.629> them<00:05:53.139> so<00:05:53.759> right<00:05:54.759> now<00:05:54.909> I

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:54.940 
can sneak up behind them so right now I

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:57.659 
can sneak up behind them so right now I
don't<00:05:55.210> have<00:05:55.360> anything<00:05:55.690> good<00:05:56.340> everyone's<00:05:57.340> kind
