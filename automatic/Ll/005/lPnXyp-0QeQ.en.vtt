00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:19.320
 robert i have a problem with my cape's 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:22.100
 television and I would like you to tell me 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.100
 shows how to change 

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:27.810
 so we will buy the little card 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.640
 TV special and even a small fashion 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.160
 of use and cable 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.470
 the gallimard cable of the television so 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.660
 it's a cable called coaxial on 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:38.340
 had shown how it's done already 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.309
 is going to strip him there are several layers 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:44.400
 a first layer all around the 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:48.780
 difficulty is the cut that the sheath 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:51.329
 is then inside this is there is a 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:55.110
 frame of a lattice two small wires 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:57.660
 metallic around there is how we go 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.070
 to say a kind of aluminum foil that 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:04.320
 him in the end do not know big 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:06.600
 something otherwise isolated and so we then 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.899
 a second protective sheath in 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:12.270
 plastic that she protects the soul of 

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:14.840
 cable that made you tiny copper wire 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:18.240
 this war also needs cutting and 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:20.250
 so here I was naked blades of 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.750
 the antenna the antenna it will work 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.970
 because there are two contacts to contact 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.970
 with the little central son and to 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.679
 contact is the sort and all that we 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.590
 will put an inside of the card that 

00:01:28.679 --> 00:01:35.789
 pass the party the pellet that will serve to 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:38.580
 screw and lattice twists like that 

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:42.239
 around the table then we will go 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:45.690
 this ring there they with tightening it 

00:01:42.239 --> 00:01:49.470
 just abut on the white the card of 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:50.940
 jean son the soul and that will be tight the 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.440
 threat laid out a little bit when we 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:55.289
 know that's gone loosen so 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:57.840
 screwdriver and tiny gliding 

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:59.880
 then we will assemble dance the whole thing 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:03.959
 when I'm serving the ring 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.960
 here it's going to crush wings kind 

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:07.510
 Sovanna 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:09.729
 so that's good and the remarkable 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:10.899
 brand new twenties and that's fine 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:12.220
 walk we will try it 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:15.310
 they make little plug your 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:18.370
 branch and the interview went well 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:20.520
 apprehend the TV it will be m thank you 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:20.520
 robert 

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:43.260
 where they give together is better
