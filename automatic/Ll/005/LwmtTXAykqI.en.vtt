00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:28.750 
well I'm in Indiana Wisconsin is really

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:30.870 
well I'm in Indiana Wisconsin is really
close<00:01:29.020> so<00:01:29.380> i<00:01:29.410> would<00:01:29.770> say<00:01:29.980> three<00:01:30.430> or<00:01:30.460> four<00:01:30.850> days

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:30.880 
close so i would say three or four days

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.480 
close so i would say three or four days
maybe<00:01:31.690> this<00:01:32.080> is<00:01:32.260> the<00:01:32.409> holiday<00:01:32.860> season<00:01:33.340> and

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:33.490 
maybe this is the holiday season and

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:36.300 
maybe this is the holiday season and
mail<00:01:34.240> does<00:01:34.600> slow<00:01:34.960> down<00:01:35.170> during<00:01:35.440> that<00:01:35.680> time<00:01:35.920> so

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:36.310 
mail does slow down during that time so

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:38.130 
mail does slow down during that time so
it's<00:01:36.610> hard<00:01:36.760> to<00:01:36.820> say<00:01:36.940> exactly<00:01:37.300> but<00:01:37.810> you're

really<00:01:38.380> close<00:01:38.620> so<00:01:38.980> it<00:01:39.010> shouldn't<00:01:39.400> take<00:01:39.460> that

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:39.580 
really close so it shouldn't take that

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:42.090 
really close so it shouldn't take that
