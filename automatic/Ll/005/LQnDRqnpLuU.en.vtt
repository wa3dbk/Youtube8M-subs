 is on the wall next to the refrigerator 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:33.700
 there you can see it in this game if 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:35.530
 get so they could see how it 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:37.570
 I saw in what position it is so good 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:39.910
 let's see the other two pieces that we 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:41.260
 ok ok people are we in the first 

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:42.730
 position where you can find the 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.680
 next piece that is kind of like 

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:46.240
 radio a kind of briefcase so more or 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:47.860
 least they will see it is in the money here 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.810
 in this door now in the part that 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:51.640
 it costs 750 to get here in that locker 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:54.400
 they jump and on the top is in 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.570
 This case was not the case but 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.100
 there is usually there if it is not there then 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:58.930
 they are in this one totem that we are going to see 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:01.420
 the location where you are 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:04.330
 in nation in nation defeat let's 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:06.340
 see it ok people who are coming to a 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:07.900
 total duty ok in this part always 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.160
 find the radius of the radius that if it is 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:12.280
 there good is always in that part 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:14.140
 where they see it ok this is always if not 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:15.880
 is in what part of where is the 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:17.980
 money is 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:20.080
 the good locker is in this part 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:22.330
 will always be there so I do not know 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:24.250
 worry though there are people we are already in 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:25.750
 the last piece of this the table below 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:27.550
 the table at the bottom that is 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.830
 where you can 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:31.720
 put together another piece for the table 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:34.080
 that there is basically a kind of 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:36.280
 table is between the area of 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.390
 green room room in the area the stop of the 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.560
 bus and in the money area it 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:40.300
 it costs in this part if it's here 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:41.890
 will always be there ok lying on that 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:43.690
 area where the table has 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:46.270
 two the locations in the first 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:48.310
 let's see the second 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:50.350
 good people are going to other locations 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:52.720
 in the electric plant ok here in this 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:54.340
 usually good area will come for 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:55.510
 here if you are not in this corner you can 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:57.790
 be there in that corner where it goes 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:59.350
 counting or if you do not come here tap and 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:01.570
 company they launch they have to launch 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:03.040
 out there and he's going to be here in this area and 

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:05.440
 where they see it here and it will always be 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.330
 there will not go there will not be this other 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:08.740
 location where you can be going to 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:10.630
 be these two areas where you can 

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:12.190
 find the table so good always 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:14.830
 will be there do not worry then the 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:16.900
 people to finish this take show 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:19.000
 the location of what is the tower of 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:20.560
 babel is in the cornfield to the side 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.020
 right this nation's 'top ten' in the 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:25.060
 left part is what is the tower 

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:26.800
 ok babel must follow the by 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:28.630
 by the cornfield and I was leaving the 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:29.950
 electric plant to the farm so that's why 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:31.870
 is looking backwards 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:33.610
 there's going to be what is a kind of 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:34.990
 lava river a kind of lava with that 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:37.060
 car and there's going to be a lava road that 

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:39.220
 be this one for this hole in the cornfield 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:40.630
 do not mess around there's going to be pretty 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:42.460
 easy once you take a little spin 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:43.810
 because the first cross that of follow 

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:46.660
 the road the first crossing on the right 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:48.520
 then the next to the left 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:50.080
 once this follows that less out there 

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:51.970
 the first crossing that is going to have the 

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:52.690
 right there is where the tower will be 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:54.430
 from babel ok 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:55.840
 they are going to look for this corner entering 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:57.220
 there is going to be quite notice that it is like 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:58.930
 a kind of gap to put a 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:01.330
 table and that 's where you 're going to be able 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:04.030
 install the parts after the pieces 

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:05.500
 of the table that is indispensable for the 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:06.970
 green ski interest course 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:09.700
 coming back we 're good we follow the path 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:11.470
 at the first junction on the right then towards 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:13.570
 the left and then we follow the path 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:14.950
 normally until there until the 

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:17.799
 true it's not very difficult a kind of 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:19.930
 a little practice and you learn the 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:21.820
 good way people already to say goodbye 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:23.380
 this one as I always hope that I have 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:24.970
 pleased that this other one has served him 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:26.230
 chapter of the guide later on good 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:28.390
 I will be uploading the history of 

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:29.860
 rites in this I'm planning everything I 'm going 

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:31.690
 arranging everything to be able to do it as 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:33.250
 you know the game did not come to me does it take me 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:34.450
