made to have almost a little bit of a

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:18.350 
made to have almost a little bit of a
hinging<00:03:16.500> motion<00:03:17.220> it<00:03:17.340> allows<00:03:17.610> a<00:03:17.820> little<00:03:18.239> bit

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:18.360 
hinging motion it allows a little bit

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.990 
hinging motion it allows a little bit
more<00:03:18.540> flexion<00:03:19.019> and<00:03:19.140> range<00:03:19.440> of<00:03:19.709> motion<00:03:20.190> for<00:03:20.880> the

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
more flexion and range of motion for the

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.680 
more flexion and range of motion for the
skater<00:03:21.739> without<00:03:22.739> the<00:03:23.250> boot<00:03:23.670> and<00:03:24.030> the<00:03:24.360> strength
