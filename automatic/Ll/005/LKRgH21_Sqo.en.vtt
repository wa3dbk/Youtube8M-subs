life and I do it in figure skating I do

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:41.290 
life and I do it in figure skating I do
it<00:03:39.350> when<00:03:39.560> I'm<00:03:39.709> on<00:03:39.920> the<00:03:40.070> ice<00:03:40.190> I<00:03:40.520> just<00:03:40.880> want<00:03:41.150> to

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:41.300 
it when I'm on the ice I just want to

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:44.170 
it when I'm on the ice I just want to
show<00:03:41.540> the<00:03:41.690> people<00:03:41.900> all<00:03:42.260> my<00:03:42.680> emotions<00:03:43.280> and<00:03:43.490> I

think<00:03:44.540> the<00:03:44.780> flamenco<00:03:45.110> is<00:03:45.380> a<00:03:45.410> very<00:03:45.709> good<00:03:46.010> way<00:03:46.280> of

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:47.080 
think the flamenco is a very good way of

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:53.660 
think the flamenco is a very good way of
representing<00:03:48.080> what<00:03:48.530> I<00:03:48.560> have<00:03:48.890> here

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:53.670 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:57.710 

I<00:03:53.700> think<00:03:54.860> what<00:03:55.860> you<00:03:56.130> have<00:03:56.340> what<00:03:56.970> is<00:03:57.240> most

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
I think what you have what is most
