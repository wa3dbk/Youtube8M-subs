Phillips<00:00:04.170> series<00:00:04.650> in<00:00:04.950> this<00:00:05.850> video<00:00:06.120> we're

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:06.330 
Phillips series in this video we're

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:07.849 
Phillips series in this video we're
going<00:00:06.420> to<00:00:06.569> look<00:00:06.660> at<00:00:06.839> emerging<00:00:07.140> a<00:00:07.529> t-junction

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:07.859 
going to look at emerging a t-junction

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:10.610 
going to look at emerging a t-junction
emerging<00:00:08.790> left<00:00:09.059> I<00:00:09.389> will<00:00:09.960> cover<00:00:10.139> emerging

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
emerging left I will cover emerging

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.060 
emerging left I will cover emerging
right<00:00:10.800> in<00:00:11.010> a<00:00:11.099> separate<00:00:11.400> video<00:00:11.490> so<00:00:12.980> t-junctions

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
right in a separate video so t-junctions

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:15.410 
right in a separate video so t-junctions
I<00:00:14.219> have<00:00:14.340> done<00:00:14.490> a<00:00:14.519> video<00:00:14.639> on<00:00:14.910> that<00:00:14.940> so<00:00:15.240> have<00:00:15.389> a

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
I have done a video on that so have a

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.570 
I have done a video on that so have a
look<00:00:15.540> at<00:00:15.690> the<00:00:15.839> video<00:00:16.770> on<00:00:16.890> how<00:00:16.920> to<00:00:17.070> spot<00:00:17.400> two

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
look at the video on how to spot two

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:18.920 
look at the video on how to spot two
junctions<00:00:17.850> and<00:00:18.119> these<00:00:18.270> signs<00:00:18.480> and<00:00:18.630> markings

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
junctions and these signs and markings

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.660 
junctions and these signs and markings
that<00:00:19.080> you<00:00:19.199> might<00:00:19.350> see<00:00:19.590> the<00:00:20.250> first<00:00:20.430> thing<00:00:20.580> would

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
that you might see the first thing would

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.000 
that you might see the first thing would
have<00:00:20.760> to<00:00:20.850> do<00:00:20.939> is<00:00:21.150> recognize<00:00:21.359> it<00:00:21.840> so<00:00:21.990> as<00:00:22.890> you're

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
have to do is recognize it so as you're

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.560 
have to do is recognize it so as you're
driving<00:00:23.160> along<00:00:23.369> you<00:00:23.820> should<00:00:24.150> recognize<00:00:24.539> that

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
driving along you should recognize that

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:25.790 
driving along you should recognize that
you<00:00:24.750> come<00:00:24.869> into<00:00:24.990> the<00:00:25.140> end<00:00:25.260> of<00:00:25.320> the<00:00:25.380> road<00:00:25.590> and

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
you come into the end of the road and

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.380 
you come into the end of the road and
you've<00:00:26.189> got<00:00:26.310> a<00:00:26.340> major<00:00:26.580> road<00:00:26.880> that's<00:00:27.150> going

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
you've got a major road that's going

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.480 
you've got a major road that's going
across<00:00:27.960> the<00:00:28.230> bottom<00:00:28.590> so<00:00:28.949> you'd<00:00:29.099> have<00:00:29.130> to<00:00:29.310> join

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
across the bottom so you'd have to join

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.250 
across the bottom so you'd have to join
that<00:00:29.670> and<00:00:29.880> that<00:00:30.269> will<00:00:30.359> be<00:00:30.449> a<00:00:30.480> t-junction<00:00:30.720> in

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
that and that will be a t-junction in

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.549 
that and that will be a t-junction in
this<00:00:31.470> case<00:00:31.650> we've<00:00:32.009> got<00:00:32.040> a<00:00:32.189> give<00:00:32.399> Y<00:00:32.550> T<00:00:32.610> Junction

00:00:33.549 --> 00:00:33.559 
this case we've got a give Y T Junction

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:36.650 
this case we've got a give Y T Junction
so<00:00:34.559> on<00:00:35.010> approach<00:00:35.430> you<00:00:35.790> go<00:00:35.969> through<00:00:36.149> your<00:00:36.270> MSP

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
so on approach you go through your MSP

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.479 
so on approach you go through your MSP
SL<00:00:36.930> routine<00:00:37.350> just<00:00:37.829> like<00:00:37.950> you<00:00:38.160> normally<00:00:38.309> would

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
SL routine just like you normally would

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.400 
SL routine just like you normally would
so<00:00:38.820> Melissa<00:00:39.210> for<00:00:39.360> going<00:00:39.540> left<00:00:39.690> interior<00:00:40.200> and

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
so Melissa for going left interior and

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.430 
so Melissa for going left interior and
left<00:00:40.590> mirrors<00:00:40.940> signal<00:00:41.960> always<00:00:42.960> give<00:00:43.110> one<00:00:43.290> and

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
left mirrors signal always give one and

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.260 
left mirrors signal always give one and
consider<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:44.280> time<00:00:44.489> of<00:00:44.640> the<00:00:44.700> signal<00:00:44.879> so<00:00:45.149> it's

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
consider the time of the signal so it's

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.779 
consider the time of the signal so it's
not<00:00:45.360> misleading<00:00:46.039> position<00:00:47.039> normal<00:00:47.489> driving

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
not misleading position normal driving

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.700 
not misleading position normal driving
position<00:00:48.210> so<00:00:48.840> all<00:00:48.960> of<00:00:49.050> that<00:00:49.079> is<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:49.410> same<00:00:49.559> as

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
position so all of that is the same as

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.680 
position so all of that is the same as
what<00:00:49.829> you<00:00:49.860> were<00:00:50.039> done<00:00:50.250> for<00:00:50.640> turning<00:00:51.390> left

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
what you were done for turning left

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.260 
what you were done for turning left
before<00:00:52.399> when<00:00:53.399> you<00:00:53.489> come<00:00:53.640> to<00:00:53.760> this<00:00:53.850> point<00:00:54.149> we

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
before when you come to this point we

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:55.910 
before when you come to this point we
need<00:00:54.420> to<00:00:54.449> think<00:00:54.600> a<00:00:54.750> little<00:00:54.840> bit<00:00:55.020> more<00:00:55.260> about

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
need to think a little bit more about

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.610 
need to think a little bit more about
what<00:00:56.129> vision<00:00:56.460> we've<00:00:56.579> got<00:00:56.820> so<00:00:57.570> if<00:00:57.809> it's<00:00:57.989> open<00:00:58.410> an

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
what vision we've got so if it's open an

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.080 
what vision we've got so if it's open an
open<00:00:58.800> junction<00:00:59.250> where<00:00:59.370> you<00:00:59.460> can<00:00:59.609> see<00:00:59.820> to<00:01:00.000> the

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
open junction where you can see to the

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.150 
open junction where you can see to the
right<00:01:00.239> in<00:01:00.359> the<00:01:00.480> left<00:01:00.690> you<00:01:01.649> might<00:01:01.829> be<00:01:01.949> able<00:01:02.070> to

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
right in the left you might be able to

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.310 
right in the left you might be able to
go<00:01:02.340> a<00:01:02.370> little<00:01:02.699> bit<00:01:02.910> faster<00:01:03.270> than<00:01:03.840> if<00:01:04.049> it<00:01:04.170> was<00:01:04.260> a

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
go a little bit faster than if it was a

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.710 
go a little bit faster than if it was a
closed<00:01:04.530> junction<00:01:05.180> so<00:01:06.180> we'll<00:01:06.420> look<00:01:06.510> at<00:01:06.630> the

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
closed junction so we'll look at the

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.690 
closed junction so we'll look at the
vision<00:01:06.900> most<00:01:07.470> junctions<00:01:07.890> are<00:01:08.040> quite<00:01:08.280> close<00:01:08.520> so

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
vision most junctions are quite close so

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.010 
vision most junctions are quite close so
in<00:01:08.820> imagine<00:01:09.119> this<00:01:09.210> one's<00:01:09.420> quite<00:01:09.570> closed<00:01:09.869> and

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
in imagine this one's quite closed and

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.020 
in imagine this one's quite closed and
we<00:01:10.080> can't<00:01:10.290> see<00:01:10.439> through<00:01:10.590> these<00:01:10.740> bushes<00:01:11.159> so

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
we can't see through these bushes so

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.030 
we can't see through these bushes so
where<00:01:12.180> would<00:01:12.270> be<00:01:12.479> planning<00:01:13.020> to<00:01:13.170> pause<00:01:13.470> at<00:01:13.770> the

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
where would be planning to pause at the

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.880 
where would be planning to pause at the
junction<00:01:14.430> so<00:01:15.030> we're<00:01:15.180> slowing<00:01:15.330> down<00:01:15.799> we<00:01:16.799> need

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
junction so we're slowing down we need

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.920 
junction so we're slowing down we need
to<00:01:16.950> think<00:01:17.070> about<00:01:17.340> what<00:01:17.520> gear<00:01:18.509> we're<00:01:18.689> going<00:01:18.840> to

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
to think about what gear we're going to

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.510 
to think about what gear we're going to
use<00:01:19.110> and<00:01:19.320> generally<00:01:19.860> if<00:01:19.920> it's<00:01:20.070> closed<00:01:20.220> it's

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
use and generally if it's closed it's

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.580 
use and generally if it's closed it's
going<00:01:20.640> to<00:01:20.700> be<00:01:20.759> first<00:01:21.000> but<00:01:21.659> the<00:01:21.780> clutch<00:01:21.930> also

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
going to be first but the clutch also

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.080 
going to be first but the clutch also
needs<00:01:22.770> to<00:01:22.890> go<00:01:23.009> down<00:01:23.189> if<00:01:23.400> the<00:01:23.520> clutch<00:01:23.700> goes<00:01:23.850> down

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
needs to go down if the clutch goes down

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.789 
needs to go down if the clutch goes down
back<00:01:24.330> here<00:01:24.360> it's<00:01:24.900> too<00:01:25.110> early<00:01:25.170> and<00:01:25.590> you'd<00:01:25.710> be

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
back here it's too early and you'd be

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:26.990 
back here it's too early and you'd be
coasting<00:01:26.189> for<00:01:26.340> too<00:01:26.460> long<00:01:26.580> and<00:01:26.700> that<00:01:26.820> could

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
coasting for too long and that could

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.420 
coasting for too long and that could
speed<00:01:27.299> up<00:01:27.619> your<00:01:28.619> car<00:01:28.799> wouldn't<00:01:28.950> be<00:01:29.100> under<00:01:29.189> full

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
speed up your car wouldn't be under full

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
control

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.490 
control
so<00:01:30.180> we'd<00:01:30.329> wait<00:01:30.479> until<00:01:30.750> we<00:01:30.840> get<00:01:30.930> to<00:01:30.990> about<00:01:31.259> two

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
so we'd wait until we get to about two

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:32.780 
so we'd wait until we get to about two
or<00:01:31.619> three<00:01:31.650> car<00:01:31.979> lengths<00:01:32.189> away<00:01:32.280> from<00:01:32.549> the<00:01:32.670> end

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
or three car lengths away from the end

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.700 
or three car lengths away from the end
then<00:01:33.270> the<00:01:33.360> clutch<00:01:33.509> can<00:01:33.689> go<00:01:33.840> down<00:01:34.079> you<00:01:34.560> don't

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
then the clutch can go down you don't

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.620 
then the clutch can go down you don't
have<00:01:34.829> to<00:01:35.009> change<00:01:35.220> into<00:01:35.700> first<00:01:35.909> at<00:01:36.150> that<00:01:36.210> point

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
have to change into first at that point

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:37.819 
have to change into first at that point
you<00:01:36.869> can<00:01:37.020> leave<00:01:37.170> it<00:01:37.320> until<00:01:37.500> you<00:01:37.590> get<00:01:37.680> a<00:01:37.770> little

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
you can leave it until you get a little

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.560 
you can leave it until you get a little
bit<00:01:38.009> closer<00:01:38.220> but<00:01:38.549> you<00:01:38.939> need<00:01:39.090> to<00:01:39.210> clutch<00:01:39.360> down

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
bit closer but you need to clutch down

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.109 
bit closer but you need to clutch down
so<00:01:39.780> that<00:01:39.900> it<00:01:39.990> doesn't<00:01:40.259> jerk<00:01:40.500> or<00:01:40.710> stall<00:01:41.119> so

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
so that it doesn't jerk or stall so

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:43.730 
so that it doesn't jerk or stall so
clutch<00:01:42.329> goes<00:01:42.509> down<00:01:42.780> we<00:01:43.170> carry<00:01:43.380> on<00:01:43.530> slowing

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
clutch goes down we carry on slowing

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.530 
clutch goes down we carry on slowing
down<00:01:43.979> as<00:01:44.399> you<00:01:44.759> get<00:01:44.880> to<00:01:45.000> the<00:01:45.090> mouth<00:01:45.270> of<00:01:45.479> the

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
down as you get to the mouth of the

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.240 
down as you get to the mouth of the
junction<00:01:45.810> steer<00:01:46.470> to<00:01:46.619> the<00:01:46.649> left<00:01:46.740> a<00:01:46.979> little<00:01:47.009> bit

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
junction steer to the left a little bit

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.280 
junction steer to the left a little bit
to<00:01:47.369> follow<00:01:47.670> the<00:01:47.790> curb<00:01:47.970> round<00:01:48.270> and<00:01:48.540> as<00:01:49.140> you're

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
to follow the curb round and as you're

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:50.569 
to follow the curb round and as you're
doing<00:01:49.380> that<00:01:49.619> then<00:01:49.829> you<00:01:49.979> can<00:01:50.130> slip<00:01:50.340> it<00:01:50.430> into

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
doing that then you can slip it into

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.280 
doing that then you can slip it into
first<00:01:50.850> gear<00:01:51.149> when<00:01:51.659> you've<00:01:51.780> got<00:01:51.930> that<00:01:52.049> bit<00:01:52.200> of

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
first gear when you've got that bit of

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.740 
first gear when you've got that bit of
an<00:01:52.409> angle<00:01:52.710> so<00:01:53.340> you'd<00:01:53.490> steer<00:01:53.790> first<00:01:54.210> and<00:01:54.390> then

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
an angle so you'd steer first and then

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.249 
an angle so you'd steer first and then
get<00:01:54.899> the<00:01:55.020> gear<00:01:56.240> also<00:01:57.240> we<00:01:57.659> need<00:01:57.810> to<00:01:57.840> be<00:01:57.930> looking

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
get the gear also we need to be looking

00:01:58.259 --> 00:01:59.569 
get the gear also we need to be looking
at<00:01:58.409> this<00:01:58.500> point<00:01:58.799> would<00:01:58.979> be<00:01:59.100> looking<00:01:59.340> to<00:01:59.399> the

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
at this point would be looking to the

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.789 
at this point would be looking to the
right<00:01:59.780> because<00:02:00.780> that's<00:02:01.140> where<00:02:01.320> the<00:02:01.409> immediate

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
right because that's where the immediate

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:02.780 
right because that's where the immediate
danger<00:02:01.979> is<00:02:02.130> going<00:02:02.250> to<00:02:02.310> come<00:02:02.460> from<00:02:02.610> the

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
danger is going to come from the

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.190 
danger is going to come from the
traffic's<00:02:03.060> going<00:02:03.210> to<00:02:03.270> be<00:02:03.329> closest<00:02:03.719> to<00:02:03.869> us<00:02:03.899> on

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
traffic's going to be closest to us on

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.480 
traffic's going to be closest to us on
that<00:02:04.229> side<00:02:04.619> so<00:02:04.829> we'd<00:02:04.950> always<00:02:05.100> look<00:02:05.280> to<00:02:05.310> the

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
that side so we'd always look to the

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.249 
that side so we'd always look to the
right<00:02:05.579> first<00:02:05.909> and<00:02:06.180> then<00:02:06.960> we'd<00:02:07.110> be<00:02:07.170> looking

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
right first and then we'd be looking

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.229 
right first and then we'd be looking
left<00:02:07.649> and<00:02:08.009> if<00:02:08.550> you<00:02:08.640> look<00:02:08.759> here<00:02:08.970> we've<00:02:09.090> got<00:02:09.179> a

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
left and if you look here we've got a

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.029 
left and if you look here we've got a
parked<00:02:09.569> car<00:02:09.599> on<00:02:09.780> the<00:02:09.959> left<00:02:10.140> there<00:02:10.349> with<00:02:10.950> this

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
parked car on the left there with this

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.270 
parked car on the left there with this
yellow<00:02:11.580> car

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
yellow car

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.190 
yellow car
going<00:02:13.000> around<00:02:13.240> that<00:02:13.390> part<00:02:13.660> cow<00:02:13.840> which<00:02:14.020> would

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
going around that part cow which would

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:15.449 
going around that part cow which would
mean<00:02:14.350> that<00:02:14.410> he's<00:02:14.620> on<00:02:14.740> our<00:02:14.770> side<00:02:15.130> of<00:02:15.160> the<00:02:15.310> road

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:15.459 
mean that he's on our side of the road

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:17.790 
mean that he's on our side of the road
as<00:02:15.790> he<00:02:15.940> goes<00:02:16.180> past<00:02:16.420> it<00:02:16.660> so<00:02:16.870> if<00:02:17.290> we<00:02:17.500> emerge

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
as he goes past it so if we emerge

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:18.990 
as he goes past it so if we emerge
without<00:02:18.100> looking<00:02:18.400> left<00:02:18.550> we<00:02:18.700> could<00:02:18.850> have<00:02:18.940> a

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
without looking left we could have a

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.309 
without looking left we could have a
collision<00:02:19.240> there<00:02:19.569> it<00:02:19.900> could<00:02:20.050> also<00:02:20.200> be

00:02:20.309 --> 00:02:20.319 
collision there it could also be

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:22.230 
collision there it could also be
cyclists<00:02:21.160> there<00:02:21.310> the<00:02:21.400> collie<00:02:21.580> pedestrians

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:22.240 
cyclists there the collie pedestrians

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:23.490 
cyclists there the collie pedestrians
could<00:02:22.540> be<00:02:22.600> anything<00:02:22.930> happening<00:02:23.200> the<00:02:23.380> less

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
could be anything happening the less

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.440 
could be anything happening the less
that<00:02:23.680> could<00:02:23.830> cause<00:02:23.980> a<00:02:24.010> problem<00:02:24.130> so<00:02:24.970> don't<00:02:25.300> just

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
that could cause a problem so don't just

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:27.300 
that could cause a problem so don't just
assume<00:02:25.540> that<00:02:25.990> because<00:02:26.590> it<00:02:26.740> might<00:02:26.890> be<00:02:27.010> clear<00:02:27.190> on

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
assume that because it might be clear on

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:28.410 
assume that because it might be clear on
the<00:02:27.400> right<00:02:27.550> that<00:02:27.790> you<00:02:27.880> can<00:02:28.000> just<00:02:28.180> go<00:02:28.300> without

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
the right that you can just go without

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.320 
the right that you can just go without
looking<00:02:28.900> always<00:02:29.500> look<00:02:29.620> right<00:02:29.800> left<00:02:30.520> right<00:02:30.760> and

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 
looking always look right left right and

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.960 
looking always look right left right and
left<00:02:31.390> again<00:02:31.780> so<00:02:32.620> twice<00:02:33.190> in<00:02:33.459> both<00:02:33.610> directions

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
left again so twice in both directions

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:36.260 
left again so twice in both directions
before<00:02:34.390> we<00:02:34.780> go<00:02:34.900> over<00:02:35.050> the<00:02:35.530> key<00:02:35.650> freight<00:02:35.890> line

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.270 
before we go over the key freight line

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:38.430 
before we go over the key freight line
to<00:02:37.270> judge<00:02:37.450> that<00:02:37.630> you<00:02:37.720> lack<00:02:37.840> the<00:02:37.870> give<00:02:38.110> way<00:02:38.260> line

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
to judge that you lack the give way line

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:39.960 
to judge that you lack the give way line
you<00:02:38.560> can<00:02:38.709> actually<00:02:38.830> see<00:02:39.160> those<00:02:39.430> lines<00:02:39.700> just

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
you can actually see those lines just

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.180 
you can actually see those lines just
underneath<00:02:40.720> your<00:02:40.900> dormer<00:02:41.260> in<00:02:41.380> normally<00:02:41.770> so

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190 
underneath your dormer in normally so

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:43.380 
underneath your dormer in normally so
that<00:02:42.370> will<00:02:42.459> tell<00:02:42.640> you<00:02:42.730> that<00:02:42.790> your<00:02:42.970> front<00:02:43.180> end

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390 
that will tell you that your front end

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:46.670 
that will tell you that your front end
is<00:02:43.780> actually<00:02:43.959> outlines<00:02:44.440> and<00:02:44.620> not<00:02:44.709> over<00:02:45.010> lines

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
is actually outlines and not over lines

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.540 
is actually outlines and not over lines
we're<00:02:47.680> looking<00:02:47.890> for<00:02:48.010> a<00:02:48.040> gap<00:02:48.220> where<00:02:48.400> we're<00:02:48.489> not

we're looking for a gap where we're not

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:50.759 
we're looking for a gap where we're not

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:52.830 
going to cause anybody to stop slow or
swerve<00:02:51.070> so<00:02:51.970> once<00:02:52.180> you<00:02:52.269> think<00:02:52.450> you've<00:02:52.540> got<00:02:52.720> that

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
swerve so once you think you've got that

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.930 
swerve so once you think you've got that
kind<00:02:53.080> of<00:02:53.140> a<00:02:53.230> gap<00:02:53.410> we<00:02:53.860> can<00:02:53.980> emerge<00:02:54.220> safely<00:02:54.489> and

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
kind of a gap we can emerge safely and

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:57.540 
kind of a gap we can emerge safely and
once<00:02:55.660> we've<00:02:55.780> emerged<00:02:56.080> and<00:02:56.950> steered<00:02:57.519> straight

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:57.550 
once we've emerged and steered straight

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:00.210 
once we've emerged and steered straight
back<00:02:58.480> into<00:02:58.660> normal<00:02:58.989> driving<00:02:59.260> position<00:02:59.650> then

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220 
back into normal driving position then

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:01.800 
back into normal driving position then
you<00:03:00.459> would<00:03:00.670> go<00:03:00.819> through<00:03:00.970> your<00:03:01.090> MSM<00:03:01.450> routine

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
you would go through your MSM routine

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:04.320 
you would go through your MSM routine
again<00:03:02.110> so<00:03:02.890> mirrors<00:03:03.280> this<00:03:03.430> time<00:03:03.640> interior<00:03:04.150> and

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:04.330 
again so mirrors this time interior and

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:06.030 
again so mirrors this time interior and
right<00:03:04.569> what<00:03:05.200> we're<00:03:05.319> looking<00:03:05.530> for<00:03:05.560> there<00:03:05.890> is

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
right what we're looking for there is

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:07.949 
right what we're looking for there is
anybody<00:03:06.250> coming<00:03:06.610> faster<00:03:07.390> than<00:03:07.510> we<00:03:07.630> perhaps<00:03:07.720> we

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:07.959 
anybody coming faster than we perhaps we

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:10.440 
anybody coming faster than we perhaps we
thought<00:03:08.370> so<00:03:09.370> if<00:03:09.610> you<00:03:09.700> see<00:03:09.850> somebody<00:03:10.030> catching

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450 
thought so if you see somebody catching

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:12.270 
thought so if you see somebody catching
you<00:03:10.510> up<00:03:10.540> then<00:03:11.200> you<00:03:11.530> can<00:03:11.680> increase<00:03:11.890> your<00:03:12.130> speed

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 
you up then you can increase your speed

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:13.590 
you up then you can increase your speed
a<00:03:12.430> little<00:03:12.580> bit<00:03:12.790> quicker<00:03:13.000> so<00:03:13.209> that<00:03:13.330> you<00:03:13.420> don't

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:13.600 
a little bit quicker so that you don't

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:16.199 
a little bit quicker so that you don't
make<00:03:13.780> them<00:03:13.900> slowed<00:03:14.170> down<00:03:14.610> the<00:03:15.610> signal<00:03:15.850> will

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:16.209 
make them slowed down the signal will

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:17.729 
make them slowed down the signal will
cancel<00:03:16.720> the<00:03:16.780> signal<00:03:17.079> if<00:03:17.170> it's<00:03:17.290> not<00:03:17.440> done<00:03:17.590> so

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:17.739 
cancel the signal if it's not done so

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:19.410 
cancel the signal if it's not done so
already<00:03:17.890> and<00:03:18.310> the<00:03:18.489> manoeuvre<00:03:18.910> to<00:03:19.060> make<00:03:19.329> the

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:19.420 
already and the manoeuvre to make the

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:22.699 
already and the manoeuvre to make the
progress<00:03:19.810> to<00:03:20.410> the<00:03:20.500> conditions<00:03:20.920> of<00:03:21.010> that<00:03:21.160> road

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
progress to the conditions of that road

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:26.400 
progress to the conditions of that road
so<00:03:23.709> that's<00:03:23.970> emerging<00:03:24.970> left<00:03:25.450> the<00:03:26.140> only<00:03:26.290> thing

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:26.410 
so that's emerging left the only thing

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:27.600 
so that's emerging left the only thing
I've<00:03:26.530> not<00:03:26.650> mentioned<00:03:26.739> there<00:03:27.010> is<00:03:27.100> pedestrians

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:27.610 
I've not mentioned there is pedestrians

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:29.340 
I've not mentioned there is pedestrians
if<00:03:27.760> you<00:03:27.850> see<00:03:28.000> a<00:03:28.030> pedestrian<00:03:28.269> but<00:03:28.959> it's<00:03:29.079> walking

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:29.350 
if you see a pedestrian but it's walking

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:31.199 
if you see a pedestrian but it's walking
across<00:03:29.620> the<00:03:29.829> end<00:03:29.950> of<00:03:30.070> the<00:03:30.130> road<00:03:30.280> as<00:03:30.730> you<00:03:30.910> arrive

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:31.209 
across the end of the road as you arrive

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:32.850 
across the end of the road as you arrive
in<00:03:31.239> there<00:03:31.570> then<00:03:31.959> we<00:03:32.260> would<00:03:32.380> give<00:03:32.530> right<00:03:32.709> to

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:32.860 
in there then we would give right to

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:35.340 
in there then we would give right to
them<00:03:32.980> but<00:03:33.430> normally<00:03:33.820> they<00:03:34.239> would<00:03:34.510> wait<00:03:35.019> for<00:03:35.230> us

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:35.350 
them but normally they would wait for us

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:36.420 
them but normally they would wait for us
they<00:03:35.500> would<00:03:35.620> see<00:03:35.799> us<00:03:35.890> coming<00:03:36.160> in<00:03:36.280> and<00:03:36.370> they

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:36.430 
they would see us coming in and they

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:38.490 
they would see us coming in and they
would<00:03:36.519> wait<00:03:36.730> there<00:03:37.000> so<00:03:37.750> eye<00:03:38.019> contact<00:03:38.410> is

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:38.500 
would wait there so eye contact is

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:40.350 
would wait there so eye contact is
important<00:03:39.070> if<00:03:39.190> they're<00:03:39.430> just<00:03:39.549> waiting<00:03:39.970> then

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:40.360 
important if they're just waiting then

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:41.550 
important if they're just waiting then
we<00:03:40.480> can<00:03:40.600> get<00:03:40.690> to<00:03:40.750> the<00:03:40.900> end<00:03:41.019> in<00:03:41.079> the<00:03:41.170> user

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560 
we can get to the end in the user

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.080 
we can get to the end in the user
they'll<00:03:41.769> go<00:03:41.890> around<00:03:42.100> the<00:03:42.160> back<00:03:42.310> of<00:03:42.430> us<00:03:42.549> but<00:03:43.000> if

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:43.090 
they'll go around the back of us but if

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:44.670 
they'll go around the back of us but if
they've<00:03:43.180> already<00:03:43.269> started<00:03:43.630> to<00:03:43.870> cross<00:03:44.140> then<00:03:44.590> we

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:44.680 
they've already started to cross then we

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:48.330 
they've already started to cross then we
would<00:03:44.859> pause<00:03:45.700> and<00:03:46.000> let<00:03:46.480> them<00:03:46.600> cross<00:03:47.340> so

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.340 
would pause and let them cross so

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:49.470 
would pause and let them cross so
hopefully<00:03:48.640> that's<00:03:48.790> helped<00:03:49.030> when<00:03:49.120> emerging

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:49.480 
hopefully that's helped when emerging

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:52.769 
hopefully that's helped when emerging
left<00:03:49.690> have<00:03:49.900> a<00:03:49.930> look<00:03:50.079> for<00:03:50.200> emerging<00:03:50.560> right
