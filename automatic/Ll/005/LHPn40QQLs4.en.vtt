00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
aware this week is all about evo vs

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.230 
aware this week is all about evo vs
iphone<00:00:15.599> for<00:00:16.199> me<00:00:16.580> one<00:00:17.580> of<00:00:17.670> the<00:00:17.760> things<00:00:17.940> I<00:00:18.060> was

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
iphone for me one of the things I was

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.609 
iphone for me one of the things I was
most<00:00:18.270> anxious<00:00:18.660> to<00:00:18.900> test<00:00:19.199> out<00:00:19.380> on<00:00:19.529> these

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
most anxious to test out on these

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.160 
most anxious to test out on these
devices<00:00:20.010> was<00:00:20.880> a<00:00:20.910> screen<00:00:21.480> visibility<00:00:22.020> in

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
devices was a screen visibility in

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.259 
devices was a screen visibility in
direct<00:00:22.470> sunlight<00:00:22.800> so<00:00:23.430> I<00:00:23.460> figured<00:00:23.550> that's<00:00:24.000> one

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
direct sunlight so I figured that's one

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:25.820 
direct sunlight so I figured that's one
of<00:00:24.359> the<00:00:24.449> first<00:00:24.630> tests<00:00:25.170> that<00:00:25.380> i<00:00:25.500> should<00:00:25.680> post

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
of the first tests that i should post

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:31.950 
of the first tests that i should post
for<00:00:26.160> you<00:00:26.279> all<00:00:26.460> so<00:00:27.150> let's<00:00:27.539> get<00:00:27.689> to<00:00:27.869> it

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:31.960 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.170 

alright<00:00:32.710> so<00:00:33.070> we're<00:00:33.460> out<00:00:33.550> here<00:00:33.760> in<00:00:33.820> direct

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:34.180 
alright so we're out here in direct

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:37.439 
alright so we're out here in direct
sunlight<00:00:34.480> it's<00:00:34.870> 89<00:00:35.739> degrees<00:00:35.950> and<00:00:36.520> very<00:00:37.090> sunny

00:00:37.439 --> 00:00:37.449 
sunlight it's 89 degrees and very sunny

00:00:37.449 --> 00:00:39.990 
sunlight it's 89 degrees and very sunny
here<00:00:37.750> while<00:00:38.530> I<00:00:38.590> was<00:00:38.739> in<00:00:38.829> the<00:00:38.920> car<00:00:39.129> I<00:00:39.160> set<00:00:39.790> both

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:40.000 
here while I was in the car I set both

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000 
here while I was in the car I set both
screens<00:00:40.420> to<00:00:40.840> the<00:00:41.019> highest<00:00:41.230> brightness

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:42.010 
screens to the highest brightness

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:43.700 
screens to the highest brightness
setting<00:00:42.280> and<00:00:42.399> turned<00:00:42.579> off<00:00:42.730> auto<00:00:42.940> brightness

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
setting and turned off auto brightness

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.920 
setting and turned off auto brightness
and<00:00:44.710> then<00:00:44.890> on<00:00:45.010> the<00:00:45.160> EVO<00:00:45.550> I<00:00:45.790> set<00:00:46.449> the<00:00:46.570> screen<00:00:46.719> to

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:46.930 
and then on the EVO I set the screen to

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:49.110 
and then on the EVO I set the screen to
never<00:00:47.110> timeout<00:00:47.620> iphone<00:00:48.519> I<00:00:48.640> don't<00:00:48.820> think<00:00:49.030> you

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:49.120 
never timeout iphone I don't think you

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.200 
never timeout iphone I don't think you
can<00:00:49.269> do<00:00:49.480> that<00:00:49.510> might<00:00:50.379> be<00:00:50.500> missing<00:00:50.680> something

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
can do that might be missing something

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.729 
can do that might be missing something
you<00:00:52.210> can<00:00:52.390> see<00:00:52.629> when<00:00:52.839> there's<00:00:53.079> a<00:00:53.170> highly

00:00:53.729 --> 00:00:53.739 
you can see when there's a highly

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:55.619 
you can see when there's a highly
reflective<00:00:53.980> i<00:00:54.460> should<00:00:55.000> say<00:00:55.180> highly<00:00:55.479> visible

00:00:55.619 --> 00:00:55.629 
reflective i should say highly visible

00:00:55.629 --> 00:00:59.069 
reflective i should say highly visible
object<00:00:56.620> above<00:00:56.890> like<00:00:57.399> white<00:00:57.670> clouds<00:00:58.079> the

00:00:59.069 --> 00:00:59.079 
object above like white clouds the

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:02.850 
object above like white clouds the
reflection<00:00:59.620> makes<00:00:59.829> it<00:01:01.050> pretty<00:01:02.050> difficult<00:01:02.350> to

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:02.860 
reflection makes it pretty difficult to

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:04.499 
reflection makes it pretty difficult to
see<00:01:03.040> the<00:01:03.070> screen<00:01:03.550> and<00:01:03.850> i'm<00:01:04.149> having<00:01:04.300> a<00:01:04.479> problem

00:01:04.499 --> 00:01:04.509 
see the screen and i'm having a problem

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:07.740 
see the screen and i'm having a problem
with<00:01:04.929> the<00:01:05.920> camera<00:01:06.340> also<00:01:06.520> focusing<00:01:07.270> on<00:01:07.450> what's

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:07.750 
with the camera also focusing on what's

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:09.240 
with the camera also focusing on what's
in<00:01:07.810> the<00:01:07.929> reflection<00:01:08.350> rather<00:01:08.830> than<00:01:09.070> on<00:01:09.220> the

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:09.250 
in the reflection rather than on the

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:18.840 
in the reflection rather than on the
screen<00:01:09.700> itself<00:01:11.009> to<00:01:12.009> my<00:01:12.220> eyes<00:01:12.520> i<00:01:17.610> guess<00:01:18.610> i<00:01:18.789> would

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:18.850 
screen itself to my eyes i guess i would

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:25.050 
screen itself to my eyes i guess i would
say<00:01:22.289> it's<00:01:23.289> close<00:01:23.770> but<00:01:24.039> the<00:01:24.190> iphone<00:01:24.610> is<00:01:24.640> more

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:25.060 
say it's close but the iphone is more

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:28.230 
say it's close but the iphone is more
visible<00:01:25.920> alright<00:01:26.920> so<00:01:27.130> now<00:01:27.340> the<00:01:27.429> focus<00:01:27.700> is<00:01:28.000> set

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:28.240 
visible alright so now the focus is set

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:31.620 
visible alright so now the focus is set
at<00:01:28.420> infinite<00:01:30.000> how<00:01:31.000> much<00:01:31.119> of<00:01:31.240> a<00:01:31.300> difference

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:31.630 
at infinite how much of a difference

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:37.410 
at infinite how much of a difference
that's<00:01:31.810> going<00:01:32.050> to<00:01:32.110> make<00:01:35.729> and<00:01:36.729> I<00:01:37.090> can't<00:01:37.329> really

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:37.420 
that's going to make and I can't really

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:41.880 
that's going to make and I can't really
tell<00:01:38.250> by<00:01:39.250> looking<00:01:39.610> at<00:01:39.700> the<00:01:39.820> cameras<00:01:40.890> display

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:41.890 
tell by looking at the cameras display

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:43.620 
tell by looking at the cameras display
right<00:01:42.159> now<00:01:42.369> what's<00:01:42.790> going<00:01:43.030> to<00:01:43.090> show<00:01:43.119> up<00:01:43.299> on<00:01:43.570> the

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:43.630 
right now what's going to show up on the

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:49.110 
right now what's going to show up on the
video

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:49.120 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:51.540 

why<00:01:50.020> don't<00:01:50.230> I<00:01:50.290> take<00:01:50.470> this<00:01:50.620> under<00:01:50.800> a<00:01:50.950> tree<00:01:51.310> over

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:51.550 
why don't I take this under a tree over

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:53.220 
why don't I take this under a tree over
here

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:53.230 
here

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:55.290 
here
the<00:01:53.800> shade<00:01:54.100> will<00:01:54.400> get<00:01:54.520> an<00:01:54.610> idea<00:01:54.850> of<00:01:54.910> what<00:01:55.150> it's

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:55.300 
the shade will get an idea of what it's

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:59.580 
the shade will get an idea of what it's
like<00:01:55.360> with<00:01:55.600> a<00:01:55.630> lot<00:01:55.870> of<00:01:55.900> ambient<00:01:56.380> light<00:01:56.740> but<00:01:58.590> not

00:01:59.580 --> 00:01:59.590 
like with a lot of ambient light but not

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:05.220 
like with a lot of ambient light but not
with<00:01:59.860> the<00:01:59.980> sky<00:02:00.280> and<00:02:00.460> clouds<00:02:00.700> overhead<00:02:04.230> so

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:05.230 
with the sky and clouds overhead so

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:09.090 
with the sky and clouds overhead so
there<00:02:05.410> you<00:02:05.440> can<00:02:05.740> see<00:02:05.770> both<00:02:06.670> are<00:02:06.970> visible<00:02:08.100> and

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:09.100 
there you can see both are visible and

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:20.610 
there you can see both are visible and
get<00:02:09.250> a<00:02:09.570> web<00:02:10.570> page<00:02:10.810> going<00:02:11.140> here<00:02:11.440> so<00:02:11.680> we<00:02:11.830> can

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.869 

see<00:02:21.580> a<00:02:21.610> little<00:02:21.849> more<00:02:22.000> white<00:02:22.269> background<00:02:23.879> so

00:02:24.869 --> 00:02:24.879 
see a little more white background so

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:26.940 
see a little more white background so
the<00:02:25.209> iphone<00:02:25.629> looks<00:02:25.810> just<00:02:26.140> a<00:02:26.290> bit<00:02:26.680> brighter

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
the iphone looks just a bit brighter

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.449 
the iphone looks just a bit brighter
these<00:02:27.190> are<00:02:27.340> both<00:02:27.430> white<00:02:28.420> backgrounds<00:02:29.459> iphone

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:30.459 
these are both white backgrounds iphone

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:33.420 
these are both white backgrounds iphone
definitely<00:02:31.209> looks<00:02:31.390> brighter<00:02:31.659> and<00:02:31.870> cleaner<00:02:32.430> so

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
definitely looks brighter and cleaner so

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:37.080 
definitely looks brighter and cleaner so
now<00:02:33.760> i'm<00:02:33.970> going<00:02:34.000> to<00:02:34.239> set<00:02:35.430> auto<00:02:36.430> brightness<00:02:36.760> on

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
now i'm going to set auto brightness on

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.089 
now i'm going to set auto brightness on
both<00:02:37.299> of<00:02:37.329> them<00:02:37.620> so<00:02:38.620> with<00:02:38.769> auto<00:02:38.920> brightness

00:02:39.089 --> 00:02:39.099 
both of them so with auto brightness

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:40.470 
both of them so with auto brightness
we're<00:02:39.430> not<00:02:39.519> seeing<00:02:39.730> much<00:02:39.849> difference<00:02:40.269> here<00:02:40.450> i

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
we're not seeing much difference here i

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:41.940 
we're not seeing much difference here i
think<00:02:40.599> the<00:02:40.780> operating<00:02:41.140> systems<00:02:41.500> are<00:02:41.680> still

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
think the operating systems are still

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:45.630 
think the operating systems are still
leaving<00:02:42.640> displays<00:02:43.120> on<00:02:43.329> full<00:02:43.629> blast<00:02:44.640> to

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.640 
leaving displays on full blast to

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:50.039 
leaving displays on full blast to
compensate<00:02:45.940> for<00:02:46.390> the<00:02:46.480> Sun<00:02:47.069> again<00:02:48.069> if<00:02:48.220> i<00:02:49.049> have

00:02:50.039 --> 00:02:50.049 
compensate for the Sun again if i have

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:51.449 
compensate for the Sun again if i have
the<00:02:50.200> sky<00:02:50.440> in<00:02:50.590> the<00:02:50.620> reflection<00:02:50.980> something

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:51.459 
the sky in the reflection something

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:54.330 
the sky in the reflection something
really<00:02:52.030> light<00:02:52.500> they're<00:02:53.500> both<00:02:53.680> very<00:02:53.890> difficult

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
really light they're both very difficult

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:58.349 
really light they're both very difficult
to<00:02:54.400> see<00:02:54.609> though<00:02:54.819> the<00:02:55.180> iphone<00:02:55.629> is<00:02:55.660> a<00:02:57.359> little

00:02:58.349 --> 00:02:58.359 
to see though the iphone is a little

00:02:58.359 --> 00:03:01.170 
to see though the iphone is a little
more<00:02:58.480> distinguishable<00:02:59.109> i<00:02:59.410> think<00:02:59.970> that<00:03:00.970> could

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
more distinguishable i think that could

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:04.680 
more distinguishable i think that could
just<00:03:01.390> be<00:03:01.450> the<00:03:02.609> darkness<00:03:03.609> of<00:03:03.730> the<00:03:03.849> icons<00:03:04.329> but

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
just be the darkness of the icons but

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:06.030 
just be the darkness of the icons but
then<00:03:04.810> of<00:03:04.900> course<00:03:05.140> when<00:03:05.319> i<00:03:05.379> have<00:03:05.620> a<00:03:05.650> dark

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
then of course when i have a dark

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.059 
then of course when i have a dark
reflection<00:03:06.519> behind<00:03:06.909> the<00:03:07.599> screen<00:03:07.959> both<00:03:08.709> become

00:03:09.059 --> 00:03:09.069 
reflection behind the screen both become

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:11.309 
reflection behind the screen both become
more<00:03:09.250> visible<00:03:09.629> and<00:03:10.629> they're<00:03:10.810> about<00:03:10.900> the<00:03:11.079> same

00:03:11.309 --> 00:03:11.319 
more visible and they're about the same

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:12.869 
more visible and they're about the same
now<00:03:11.620> i'm<00:03:11.829> going<00:03:12.129> to<00:03:12.280> go<00:03:12.459> back<00:03:12.489> into<00:03:12.790> the

00:03:12.869 --> 00:03:12.879 
now i'm going to go back into the

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:24.020 
now i'm going to go back into the
sunlight<00:03:13.409> with<00:03:14.409> auto<00:03:14.680> brightness

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:27.470 

and<00:03:24.240> again<00:03:24.930> the<00:03:25.080> situation<00:03:25.650> is<00:03:26.480> virtually

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
and again the situation is virtually

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:30.559 
and again the situation is virtually
identical<00:03:28.400> probably<00:03:29.400> is<00:03:29.550> identical<00:03:30.180> to<00:03:30.300> when

00:03:30.559 --> 00:03:30.569 
identical probably is identical to when

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:32.600 
identical probably is identical to when
I<00:03:30.600> had<00:03:30.720> them<00:03:31.110> at<00:03:31.350> full<00:03:31.860> brightness<00:03:32.040> because<00:03:32.520> i

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:32.610 
I had them at full brightness because i

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:33.830 
I had them at full brightness because i
think<00:03:32.670> the<00:03:32.880> operating<00:03:33.240> systems<00:03:33.540> are<00:03:33.660> leading

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
think the operating systems are leading

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.809 
think the operating systems are leading
them<00:03:34.050> there<00:03:34.230> now<00:03:34.740> i'm<00:03:34.890> going<00:03:35.100> to<00:03:35.220> set<00:03:35.400> both<00:03:35.580> to

00:03:35.809 --> 00:03:35.819 
them there now i'm going to set both to

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:38.360 
them there now i'm going to set both to
the<00:03:35.850> dimmest<00:03:36.420> setting<00:03:36.750> not<00:03:37.350> surprisingly<00:03:37.920> the

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
the dimmest setting not surprisingly the

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:41.449 
the dimmest setting not surprisingly the
screens<00:03:38.730> are<00:03:39.000> just<00:03:39.270> completely<00:03:40.459> invisible

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:41.459 
screens are just completely invisible

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:43.910 
screens are just completely invisible
there's<00:03:42.300> you<00:03:42.690> can't<00:03:42.900> detect<00:03:43.170> that<00:03:43.319> this<00:03:43.500> that

there's you can't detect that this that

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:45.830 
there's you can't detect that this that

look<00:04:22.080> the<00:04:22.320> same<00:04:22.560> when<00:04:22.620> they<00:04:23.130> have<00:04:23.280> a<00:04:23.310> dark

personally think that the iphone is
