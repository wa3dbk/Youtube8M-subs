and<00:01:01.920> remove<00:01:02.219> some<00:01:02.730> of<00:01:02.879> the<00:01:02.969> black<00:01:03.239> insulation

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
and remove some of the black insulation

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.679 
and remove some of the black insulation
so<00:01:04.350> that<00:01:04.379> we<00:01:04.650> have<00:01:04.799> a<00:01:04.830> little<00:01:05.070> more<00:01:05.280> room<00:01:05.610> here

00:01:08.679 --> 00:01:08.689 

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:11.870 

I'm<00:01:09.689> going<00:01:09.869> to<00:01:09.990> remove<00:01:10.320> about<00:01:11.010> an<00:01:11.430> inch<00:01:11.700> of

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
I'm going to remove about an inch of

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.899 
I'm going to remove about an inch of
this<00:01:12.470> but<00:01:13.470> just<00:01:13.770> taking<00:01:14.040> a<00:01:14.310> knife<00:01:14.930> and<00:01:15.930> rolling

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:16.909 
this but just taking a knife and rolling

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:25.539 
this but just taking a knife and rolling
the<00:01:17.909> wire<00:01:20.720> and<00:01:21.720> just<00:01:22.500> creating<00:01:22.950> a<00:01:23.159> nick<00:01:23.490> in<00:01:23.759> it

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:25.549 
the wire and just creating a nick in it

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:27.859 
the wire and just creating a nick in it
then<00:01:26.549> you<00:01:26.670> can<00:01:26.790> just<00:01:26.820> pull<00:01:27.240> this<00:01:27.450> black

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
then you can just pull this black

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:36.960 
then you can just pull this black
insulation<00:01:28.710> off

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:36.970 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:41.100 

we<00:01:37.540> don't<00:01:37.780> use<00:01:38.050> the<00:01:38.290> shield<00:01:38.680> so<00:01:39.690> we<00:01:40.690> can<00:01:40.870> cut

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:41.110 
we don't use the shield so we can cut

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:43.980 
we don't use the shield so we can cut
that<00:01:41.320> off<00:01:41.380> as<00:01:41.860> close<00:01:42.760> to<00:01:43.120> the<00:01:43.240> bottom<00:01:43.660> as<00:01:43.780> we

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:43.990 
that off as close to the bottom as we

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:49.560 
that off as close to the bottom as we
can<00:01:46.530> we're<00:01:47.530> going<00:01:47.680> to<00:01:47.770> cut<00:01:48.010> the<00:01:48.160> shield<00:01:48.550> off<00:01:48.940> of

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:49.570 
can we're going to cut the shield off of

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:54.870 
can we're going to cut the shield off of
both<00:01:49.780> the<00:01:50.080> white<00:01:50.380> and<00:01:50.730> the<00:01:51.730> red<00:01:51.760> wire<00:01:53.700> right<00:01:54.700> at

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:54.880 
both the white and the red wire right at

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:59.940 
both the white and the red wire right at
the<00:01:55.000> base

00:01:59.940 --> 00:01:59.950 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:01.499 

then<00:02:00.490> you're<00:02:00.700> going<00:02:00.820> to<00:02:00.909> take<00:02:01.149> black

00:02:01.499 --> 00:02:01.509 
then you're going to take black

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:06.120 
then you're going to take black
electrical<00:02:02.350> tape<00:02:03.869> and<00:02:04.869> wrap<00:02:05.170> it<00:02:05.409> around<00:02:05.500> here

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.130 
electrical tape and wrap it around here

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:11.540 
electrical tape and wrap it around here
so<00:02:06.969> that<00:02:07.360> shield<00:02:07.750> can't<00:02:08.080> touch<00:02:08.410> anything<00:02:08.800> just

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:24.460 

take<00:02:12.550> a<00:02:12.580> short<00:02:12.940> piece<00:02:13.209> of<00:02:13.450> electrical<00:02:14.019> tape

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:33.050 

and<00:02:24.980> roll<00:02:25.280> it<00:02:25.310> around

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.370 

and<00:02:34.060> do<00:02:34.210> the<00:02:34.360> same<00:02:34.600> thing<00:02:34.900> with<00:02:35.080> the<00:02:35.200> white

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.380 
and do the same thing with the white

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:42.320 
and do the same thing with the white
wire

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:44.790 

now<00:02:43.330> we<00:02:43.390> need<00:02:43.750> to<00:02:43.930> strip<00:02:44.260> some<00:02:44.530> of<00:02:44.590> the

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:44.800 
now we need to strip some of the

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:49.760 
now we need to strip some of the
insulation<00:02:45.610> off<00:02:45.790> of<00:02:45.820> the<00:02:46.270> red<00:02:47.110> and<00:02:47.290> white<00:02:47.530> wire

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:49.770 
insulation off of the red and white wire

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:53.670 
insulation off of the red and white wire
do<00:02:50.770> the<00:02:50.920> same<00:02:51.220> thing<00:02:51.580> just<00:02:52.000> gently<00:02:52.870> roll<00:02:53.290> that

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
do the same thing just gently roll that

00:02:53.680 --> 00:03:00.090 
do the same thing just gently roll that
wire<00:02:54.750> against<00:02:55.750> the<00:02:55.840> night<00:02:58.440> you<00:02:59.440> can<00:02:59.590> just<00:02:59.650> pull

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:00.100 
wire against the night you can just pull

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:06.900 
wire against the night you can just pull
this<00:03:00.310> right<00:03:01.270> insulation<00:03:02.080> off<00:03:05.310> the<00:03:06.310> best<00:03:06.640> thing

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:06.910 
this right insulation off the best thing

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:10.320 
this right insulation off the best thing
to<00:03:06.940> do<00:03:07.240> is<00:03:08.170> to<00:03:08.470> cut<00:03:08.770> this<00:03:09.280> little<00:03:09.520> tip<00:03:09.970> that's

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:10.330 
to do is to cut this little tip that's

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:18.810 
to do is to cut this little tip that's
been<00:03:10.570> soldered<00:03:10.930> together<00:03:11.230> ah<00:03:17.460> so<00:03:18.460> that<00:03:18.670> you

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:18.820 
been soldered together ah so that you

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:24.740 
been soldered together ah so that you
can<00:03:18.970> fray<00:03:19.330> the<00:03:19.540> wire<00:03:19.750> out

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:28.070 

let's<00:03:25.260> take<00:03:25.470> the<00:03:25.650> wire<00:03:26.390> that's<00:03:27.390> been<00:03:27.660> stripped

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:28.080 
let's take the wire that's been stripped

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:34.640 
let's take the wire that's been stripped
and<00:03:28.520> bend<00:03:29.520> it<00:03:29.670> back<00:03:29.970> on<00:03:30.000> itself<00:03:33.380> fray<00:03:34.380> this

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
and bend it back on itself fray this

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:41.480 
and bend it back on itself fray this
wire<00:03:34.920> out<00:03:37.730> and<00:03:38.730> you<00:03:38.820> take<00:03:39.030> it<00:03:40.130> this<00:03:41.130> about

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:41.490 
wire out and you take it this about

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:46.250 
wire out and you take it this about
three<00:03:41.850> inches<00:03:42.270> of<00:03:42.930> the<00:03:43.740> loop<00:03:44.040> part<00:03:44.520> of<00:03:45.330> velcro

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
three inches of the loop part of velcro

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.560 
three inches of the loop part of velcro
it's<00:03:46.530> the<00:03:46.680> softer<00:03:47.550> part<00:03:47.850> that<00:03:48.030> feels<00:03:48.300> like

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:48.570 
it's the softer part that feels like

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:54.410 
it's the softer part that feels like
carpet<00:03:50.450> peel<00:03:51.450> this<00:03:51.660> off<00:03:53.120> and<00:03:54.120> you're<00:03:54.210> going<00:03:54.330> to

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:54.420 
carpet peel this off and you're going to

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:58.010 
carpet peel this off and you're going to
put<00:03:54.570> the<00:03:54.690> wire<00:03:54.930> in<00:03:56.120> a<00:03:57.120> little<00:03:57.390> way<00:03:57.540> from<00:03:57.840> the

00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:58.020 
put the wire in a little way from the

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:07.640 
put the wire in a little way from the
end<00:04:01.220> make<00:04:02.220> sure<00:04:02.520> that<00:04:05.209> strands<00:04:06.209> of<00:04:06.480> wire<00:04:06.720> are

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
end make sure that strands of wire are

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:13.520 
end make sure that strands of wire are
exposed<00:04:08.250> like<00:04:08.550> that<00:04:12.080> we're<00:04:13.080> going<00:04:13.260> to<00:04:13.320> take<00:04:13.500> a

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.530 
exposed like that we're going to take a

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:33.760 
exposed like that we're going to take a
lemon<00:04:13.830> foil<00:04:15.980> and<00:04:16.980> just<00:04:23.720> let<00:04:24.720> it<00:04:24.870> get<00:04:25.020> stuck

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:33.770 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:42.200 

work<00:04:34.770> the<00:04:37.610> wire<00:04:38.610> so<00:04:39.090> that<00:04:39.120> it's<00:04:40.880> little<00:04:41.880> stuck

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:42.210 
work the wire so that it's little stuck

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:48.380 
work the wire so that it's little stuck
to<00:04:42.450> the<00:04:43.970> velcro<00:04:46.040> put<00:04:47.040> the<00:04:47.190> wires<00:04:47.430> in<00:04:47.760> contact

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:48.390 
to the velcro put the wires in contact

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:54.920 
to the velcro put the wires in contact
with<00:04:48.630> the<00:04:48.840> aluminum<00:04:49.350> foil<00:04:53.540> then<00:04:54.540> you<00:04:54.690> just

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:54.930 
with the aluminum foil then you just

00:04:54.930 --> 00:05:02.450 
with the aluminum foil then you just
need<00:04:55.140> to<00:04:55.290> trim<00:04:55.590> around<00:05:00.680> to<00:05:01.680> cut<00:05:01.919> off<00:05:02.100> any

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:02.460 
need to trim around to cut off any

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:14.870 
need to trim around to cut off any
excess<00:05:02.690> aluminum<00:05:04.880> oil<00:05:09.950> make<00:05:10.950> sure<00:05:10.979> you<00:05:11.340> know

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:14.880 

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:21.570 

accidentally<00:05:15.880> cut<00:05:16.150> the<00:05:16.300> wire<00:05:20.310> going<00:05:21.310> to<00:05:21.460> do

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:21.580 
accidentally cut the wire going to do

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:31.230 
accidentally cut the wire going to do
the<00:05:21.730> same<00:05:22.030> thing<00:05:25.230> with<00:05:26.230> the<00:05:26.410> white<00:05:26.650> wire<00:05:30.240> next

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:31.240 
the same thing with the white wire next

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:34.110 
the same thing with the white wire next
we<00:05:31.510> take<00:05:31.750> a<00:05:31.780> short<00:05:32.260> piece<00:05:32.590> of<00:05:32.890> the<00:05:33.130> loop<00:05:33.460> part

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:34.120 
we take a short piece of the loop part

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:38.820 
we take a short piece of the loop part
of<00:05:34.330> the<00:05:34.390> velcro<00:05:35.010> this<00:05:36.010> is<00:05:36.220> a<00:05:37.200> V<00:05:38.200> the<00:05:38.350> rougher

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:38.830 
of the velcro this is a V the rougher

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:43.710 
of the velcro this is a V the rougher
kind<00:05:39.570> peel<00:05:40.570> that<00:05:40.810> off<00:05:41.760> you<00:05:42.760> put<00:05:43.060> this<00:05:43.240> on<00:05:43.540> the

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:43.720 
kind peel that off you put this on the

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:55.620 
kind peel that off you put this on the
opposite<00:05:44.380> end<00:05:44.650> from<00:05:45.300> the<00:05:46.300> wire<00:05:50.760> stick<00:05:51.760> that<00:05:54.630> so

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:55.630 
opposite end from the wire stick that so

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:58.500 
opposite end from the wire stick that so
we<00:05:55.720> don't<00:05:55.930> use<00:05:56.140> the<00:05:56.380> yellow<00:05:56.590> wire<00:05:56.920> for<00:05:57.370> now<00:05:57.550> so

00:05:58.500 --> 00:05:58.510 
we don't use the yellow wire for now so

00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:01.770 
we don't use the yellow wire for now so
we'll<00:05:58.600> just<00:05:58.810> take<00:05:58.990> some<00:05:59.260> tape<00:05:59.560> and<00:06:00.780> insulate

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:01.780 
we'll just take some tape and insulate

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:05.700 
we'll just take some tape and insulate
it<00:06:02.050> and<00:06:02.290> the<00:06:02.860> shield<00:06:04.080> so<00:06:05.080> that<00:06:05.260> they<00:06:05.410> can't

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:05.710 
it and the shield so that they can't

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:06.840 
it and the shield so that they can't
touch<00:06:06.040> anything

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:06.850 
touch anything

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:12.720 
touch anything
I<00:06:09.480> just<00:06:10.480> put<00:06:10.720> tape<00:06:10.960> over<00:06:11.140> over<00:06:11.950> all<00:06:12.100> that<00:06:12.430> and

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:12.730 
I just put tape over over all that and

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:20.970 
I just put tape over over all that and
then<00:06:13.200> tape<00:06:14.200> this<00:06:16.860> back<00:06:17.860> against<00:06:18.490> the

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:20.980 

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:25.260 

the<00:06:21.970> wires<00:06:22.240> so<00:06:22.630> it's<00:06:22.780> out<00:06:22.930> of<00:06:22.960> the<00:06:23.140> way<00:06:24.060> so<00:06:25.060> then

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:25.270 
the wires so it's out of the way so then

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:31.970 
the wires so it's out of the way so then
at<00:06:25.450> the<00:06:27.510> electrodes<00:06:29.100> you<00:06:30.100> loop<00:06:30.370> to<00:06:30.610> themselves

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:31.980 
at the electrodes you loop to themselves

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:37.490 
at the electrodes you loop to themselves
with<00:06:32.980> that<00:06:33.130> velcro<00:06:34.530> and<00:06:35.530> they<00:06:35.860> adjust<00:06:36.310> them

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:37.500 
with that velcro and they adjust them

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:42.960 
with that velcro and they adjust them
until<00:06:38.500> they<00:06:38.650> slide<00:06:39.010> on<00:06:39.040> your<00:06:39.430> fingers<00:06:41.850> so<00:06:42.850> that

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:42.970 
until they slide on your fingers so that

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:45.600 
until they slide on your fingers so that
they're<00:06:43.150> tight<00:06:43.890> but<00:06:44.890> not<00:06:44.920> so<00:06:45.310> tight<00:06:45.580> that

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:45.610 
they're tight but not so tight that

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:48.030 
they're tight but not so tight that
you're<00:06:46.030> going<00:06:46.210> to<00:06:46.270> lose<00:06:46.810> any<00:06:47.050> circulation<00:06:47.680> or

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:48.040 
you're going to lose any circulation or

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:52.140 
you're going to lose any circulation or
anything<00:06:48.190> like<00:06:48.400> that<00:06:48.750> and<00:06:49.750> there<00:06:49.900> you<00:06:49.930> go
