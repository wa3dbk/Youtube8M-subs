00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:15.310 
so that would be a bit pointless just I

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:16.649 
so that would be a bit pointless just I
suppose<00:04:15.609> the<00:04:15.729> moral<00:04:15.970> of<00:04:16.030> this<00:04:16.180> is<00:04:16.419> if<00:04:16.539> you're

00:04:19.649 --> 00:04:19.659 
using a BTL just you know persevere and

00:04:19.659 --> 00:04:20.220
