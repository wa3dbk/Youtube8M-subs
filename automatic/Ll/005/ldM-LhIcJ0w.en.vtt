00:00:01.349 --> 00:00:03.000
 there is 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.870
 now feel this 

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:08.870
 it left 

00:00:12.999 --> 00:00:16.789
 but just as it is today, she and I knew a new song with Lena 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:17.499
 miller 

00:00:17.499 --> 00:00:21.449
 I have to start there is very fat thank you for this 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.650
 Loyalty and steadiness that they still move a bit the output 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.720
 who is currently fasting fast now 

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:31.650
 So stay true and the on 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.000
 the vocals at the place for it and plan a professional with the topic 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.460
 Security have participated 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:40.310
 it has something to do with the world of gm that I want through this money that 

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:41.240
 come up 

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:45.300
 Although the Real sees itself in the GM plans degree times more wants three or 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.450
 four 

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:49.899
 can also be five I do not know exactly whether in the course not certain 

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:53.559
 I started there all of a sudden and it is also the Steiner class of BI 

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:56.290
 Feith that we think I'm lightweight 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:58.350
 for the European Championship bring Marathon 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.310
 if I am not mistaken, the whole thing must be designed and year 

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:05.489
 so far, the template has been upset because 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.790
 No, in retrospect, the long night of research is also the right tactic 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:10.370
 would have 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:13.370
 both prematurely quite playable in these games because I thought so 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.420
 that could actually always run so that the stars because otherwise runs 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:20.230
 Actually not that way, it's always the turn of the pack if I give you yours 

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:22.430
 Class play me something like a deer and 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:25.890
 For me this is a wrong intended to be assured with me 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.470
 all the time as invited to arrive 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:31.150
 or something I represent certain rather moderately living up 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:34.770
 with the example of the m60 then something is not at all clear 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.690
 First, because the media meeting point and reliable and reliable 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:42.180
 and secondly, the vice is Andrist he can not play at all 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.980
 I do not know why actually it is enough specification I can not even 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:48.650
 enough Cox play there I am always so let me talk to the case 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:51.810
 a funny thing and we will 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.450
 a concrete report "I'll ask you my question instead of four 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:55.960
 times 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:57.380
 see megamäßig grid 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:58.350
 it was already us 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.200
 where I like to know if there is a specific tactic in Puglia confidence 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.660
 going 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:05.930
 because maybe in defense with three times a few things 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:09.729
 could take over in addition to the addresses across because 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:12.890
 I do not want to think about whether I am 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.049
 I then that the degree programs with 3 

00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:17.419
 what a special tactic with my own 

00:02:17.419 --> 00:02:21.440
 because I think you're all that speaks for that also has one 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.289
 the 88 million have taken a while 

00:02:24.289 --> 00:02:28.339
 his renouncement Hausen experience points you need around 15 on the 

00:02:28.339 --> 00:02:29.549
 be tight 

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:30.849
 March set 

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:34.080
 good to govern but where you do not need to find it for now 

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:37.060
 could you think over my tactics but he was clear that I was 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:38.009
 did not make it again 

00:02:38.009 --> 00:02:40.959
 I'm celebrating now 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:44.260
 Harald through my platform change and so I have already figured out and 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.670
 the whole horror the manufacturers would also already vigorously or 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:49.689
 other stuff 

00:02:49.689 --> 00:02:52.749
 I think VW was already there if I did not have it all the time 

00:02:52.749 --> 00:02:53.369
 so 

00:02:53.369 --> 00:02:56.659
 Brummis with cities between a possible one could wish for 

00:02:56.659 --> 00:03:00.040
 Who wonders that it will eventually run ds-spiel or on the Wii 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.149
 I still have a few combat boots with me 

00:03:02.149 --> 00:03:05.279
 he creates and then back a few professionals 

00:03:05.279 --> 00:03:07.879
 is not going to change anything now i think most of you will be 

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:10.769
 Probably already strong 5th or something he could sometimes 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:12.879
 shout when video replies 

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:14.759
 which deadline safe side 

00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:18.249
 and I can now just tell you what I mean by that tactic so 

00:03:18.249 --> 00:03:22.019
 said wanting to give way to some of you who would like to wonder if now 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:24.009
 Tactics PDF what do you mean now 

00:03:24.009 --> 00:03:27.789
 that 's why I had the whole thing it was mine so well with the tactics 

00:03:27.789 --> 00:03:30.209
 that their aid pledges are appropriate 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:33.299
 for example, especially for the first you out 

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:37.439
 May be the first time the Stone Networks Lightweights Marathon at the Mirror 

00:03:37.439 --> 00:03:39.489
 report sausage blindness purchase 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:43.360
 So what's enough or paper for example, even with the game modes are vigils 

00:03:43.359 --> 00:03:43.780
 from 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:45.499
 does not want anything here 

00:03:45.499 --> 00:03:48.670
 what unites them is the standard Iwema makes if he does not visit 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:50.189
 if you like that too 

00:03:50.189 --> 00:03:54.319
 I'm that nice thing to call example and indeed you can say so 

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:57.819
 we are since he thought you are still not looking for and destroy play 

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:00.989
 First for winter tires are the best I believe available 

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:02.239
 you need it 

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:03.279
 but if you do 

00:04:03.279 --> 00:04:06.129
 a friend had an invite and search 

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:08.359
 you can do the whole thing too 

00:04:08.359 --> 00:04:12.089
 and I think some of you so if a few mugs are looking for his films and 

00:04:12.089 --> 00:04:15.859
 I destroyed 17 more underneath ice you can more completely discover electricity 

00:04:15.859 --> 00:04:16.959
 always 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:20.309
 where and so, for example, I'll never his tactics 

00:04:20.309 --> 00:04:23.529
 and I would be interested too if we still have you too 

00:04:23.529 --> 00:04:25.370
 Hours run by the baker 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:28.880
 such a weapon as, for example, if you like the e-card's gameplay 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:31.189
 Targeted appropriated which have you thanks 

00:04:31.189 --> 00:04:32.819
 Alf um 

00:04:32.819 --> 00:04:36.529
 you're primarily the Affair up on Farmers or are you here knowing 

00:04:36.529 --> 00:04:37.969
 I 

00:04:37.969 --> 00:04:40.589
 I can also markets is an itc judge Berlin that takes time now 

00:04:40.589 --> 00:04:42.219
 nothing to pick 

00:04:42.219 --> 00:04:45.829
 if I have that or even 10 or farsighted feathers are rare 

00:04:46.699 --> 00:04:50.389
 I think he understood the principle of value in itself and that's where I come from 

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:52.529
 even to talk about another thing 

00:04:52.529 --> 00:04:56.659
 and by also like to know times has spurred on you uphill that yourself 

00:04:56.659 --> 00:05:00.389
 one because blackouts two years do not really report the Langenfelder 

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:03.860
 An incentive with this purchase because you can buy everything 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:07.490
 but also clear that you had to be mine and then you have all 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:10.699
 Payments back after five wins 

00:05:10.699 --> 00:05:14.460
 I think that will be in the 2 1 that one of his houses does not have 

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:16.520
 once near dementia triggers 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:18.349
 but to the cause of the 

00:05:18.349 --> 00:05:19.770
 Incentive to come back 

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:21.030
 Manufacturers know 

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:24.220
 Voigt the Goldbacher have inspired with me it was a bit like I have 

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:26.039
 sometimes thought in the a-team 

00:05:26.039 --> 00:05:29.309
 Christmas Eve yes deserves the golden coat of arms 

00:05:29.309 --> 00:05:32.419
 if I think about it now 

00:05:32.419 --> 00:05:35.309
 he no longer creates the pain 

00:05:35.309 --> 00:05:36.259
 fuck it all 

00:05:36.259 --> 00:05:38.240
 dpa what alright Berlin 

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:41.160
 I wanted that was already said a few times that I like something from 

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:41.960
 you should know 

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:43.990
 and a lot of effort 

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:46.839
 on the other hand, the whole thing with these countries was the same 

00:05:46.839 --> 00:05:50.430
 because sometimes I am not, but sometimes I would really like to learn 

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:52.189
 Hader does not just have an account 

00:05:52.189 --> 00:05:55.150
 This is usually forced to mention and 

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:57.039
 there are also such leads, for example 

00:05:57.039 --> 00:05:59.979
 the example I can say go investigator who has indeed had an account 

00:05:59.979 --> 00:06:01.650
 simply m50 has remained 

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:04.820
 without the light to back then I wanted to buy all weapons so something with it 

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:06.900
 even if he feels like between Wassen can 

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:09.729
 and he also has a control of many will be open 

00:06:09.729 --> 00:06:12.550
 the recent escape has achieved something in the long term as well 

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:13.889
 that's what I mean by that 

00:06:13.889 --> 00:06:16.449
 Kleinschmidt cool thing I do not know why I do not do that anymore 

00:06:16.449 --> 00:06:19.580
 a little did not do everything 

00:06:20.199 --> 00:06:21.680
 below 

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:24.810
 I think the whole thematic is pretty overwhelmed because there are so many 

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:26.650
 Questions from Jan Ullrich were 

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:30.190
 a year ago at the end also had to say thank you very quickly to the 

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:33.400
 pronounce next to USB or not at all 

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:37.669
 He also wants to be the customer once LAN GENEART Inc the judge on 

00:06:37.669 --> 00:06:39.979
 Description and to Mr. Dr 

00:06:39.979 --> 00:06:43.529
 I do not care who his friend is of me who is still playing in the 

00:06:43.529 --> 00:06:46.810
 Series of injuries or do not find them cheap price 

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:49.260
 mediated and I promised him that I would do it for him too 

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:52.240
 Again, there is a thing here, but we can also refer to the 

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:55.039
 Doing a bit of sniper laundry and something dangerous 

00:06:55.039 --> 00:06:56.210
 just fine 

00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:58.780
 and if he stands by his side doing shop too 

00:06:58.780 --> 00:06:59.659
 drop by 

00:06:59.659 --> 00:07:02.020
 Minkus within the short description 

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:03.099
 good election people 

00:07:03.099 --> 00:07:06.479
 until the next old times answered the questions and also
