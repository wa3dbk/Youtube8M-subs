00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:49.190
 in the description of the video 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:50.809
 after when you put a blue 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:51.950
 turquoise for your crewe color 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:53.510

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:54.829
 custom with your car 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:57.890
 after you will just go 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:58.940
 in the painting category so after 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:00.649
 you go in the main colors 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:02.270
 and you buy a matte black color 

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:03.710
 we before that I just show you to 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:06.130
 What looks like the color crewe 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:08.149
 I put so simple turquoise 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:09.680
 so after when you redeem the 

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:11.450
 matte black color you go into the 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.340
 metallic paint category and you 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:14.840
 do not buy any paint or do anything 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.160
 just three times back and you 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.360
 go in the plates and you change 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:17.869
 simply the color of your 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.610
 plate 

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:20.780
 when you change the painting of 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:22.610
 your place you are simply going 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.020
 come back in the paintings and now 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:25.459
 you can pearl the matte color that 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:28.490
 you put just before you go 

00:01:25.459 --> 00:01:29.630

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.160
 now when you have pearled the 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:32.630
 matte paint is going to be simply bought 

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:33.979
 the turquoise blue crewe color and 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:35.929
 so it will make a color crewe 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:36.890
 turquoise blue maths and nacry with 

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:40.759
