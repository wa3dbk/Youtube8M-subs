photography Oh cut them for my birthday
party<00:00:04.560> here<00:00:04.770> at<00:00:04.859> my<00:00:04.980> mom's<00:00:05.160> house<00:00:05.400> and<00:00:05.700> I<00:00:06.450> think

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
party here at my mom's house and I think

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:09.410 
party here at my mom's house and I think
I'm<00:00:06.899> gonna<00:00:06.990> do<00:00:07.109> a<00:00:07.140> time-lapse<00:00:07.500> video<00:00:08.059> of<00:00:09.059> this

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
I'm gonna do a time-lapse video of this

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.100 
I'm gonna do a time-lapse video of this
so<00:00:09.719> I<00:00:09.750> have<00:00:10.080> my<00:00:10.309> GoPro<00:00:11.309> set<00:00:12.120> on<00:00:12.240> a<00:00:12.330> tripod<00:00:12.599> here

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
so I have my GoPro set on a tripod here

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.650 
so I have my GoPro set on a tripod here
it's<00:00:13.530> really<00:00:14.309> locked<00:00:14.580> down<00:00:14.849> so<00:00:14.910> it<00:00:15.269> won't<00:00:15.420> move

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
it's really locked down so it won't move

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.170 
it's really locked down so it won't move
the<00:00:16.350> next<00:00:16.590> step<00:00:16.920> I'll<00:00:17.130> turn<00:00:17.430> it<00:00:17.580> on<00:00:17.730> and<00:00:18.090> I'll

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
the next step I'll turn it on and I'll

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.990 
the next step I'll turn it on and I'll
have<00:00:18.330> it<00:00:18.359> take<00:00:18.630> one<00:00:19.109> photo<00:00:19.619> every<00:00:19.740> two<00:00:20.520> seconds

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
have it take one photo every two seconds

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.050 
have it take one photo every two seconds
so<00:00:21.960> that<00:00:22.109> should<00:00:22.380> produce<00:00:23.340> a<00:00:23.640> pretty<00:00:23.880> nice

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
so that should produce a pretty nice

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.460 
so that should produce a pretty nice
pretty<00:00:24.779> fluid<00:00:25.910> time-lapse<00:00:26.910> video<00:00:27.240> and<00:00:27.480> where

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
pretty fluid time-lapse video and where

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.679 
pretty fluid time-lapse video and where
the<00:00:28.560> GoPro<00:00:29.010> was<00:00:29.400> in<00:00:29.609> HD<00:00:29.970> hero2

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
the GoPro was in HD hero2

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.870 
the GoPro was in HD hero2
I<00:00:30.990> think<00:00:31.769> the<00:00:31.949> battery<00:00:32.340> will<00:00:32.489> last<00:00:32.520> about

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
I think the battery will last about

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.970 
I think the battery will last about
three<00:00:33.420> hours<00:00:33.570> ish<00:00:34.140> taking<00:00:34.559> a<00:00:34.620> picture<00:00:34.770> every

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
three hours ish taking a picture every

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.090 
three hours ish taking a picture every
two<00:00:35.309> hours<00:00:35.960> every<00:00:36.960> two<00:00:37.110> seconds<00:00:37.440> then<00:00:37.950> we'll

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
two hours every two seconds then we'll

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.319 
two hours every two seconds then we'll
take<00:00:38.250> them<00:00:38.370> into<00:00:38.489> Lightroom<00:00:38.940> and<00:00:39.090> we'll

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
take them into Lightroom and we'll

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.569 
take them into Lightroom and we'll
process<00:00:39.629> the<00:00:40.050> images<00:00:40.379> and<00:00:40.680> then<00:00:40.860> export<00:00:41.340> them

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
process the images and then export them

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.520 
process the images and then export them
and<00:00:41.879> I'll<00:00:42.149> show<00:00:42.360> you<00:00:42.390> how<00:00:42.660> to<00:00:42.719> turn<00:00:42.989> it<00:00:43.140> into<00:00:43.260> a

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
and I'll show you how to turn it into a

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.209 
and I'll show you how to turn it into a
video<00:00:44.280> clip<00:00:44.850> using<00:00:45.149> premiere<00:00:46.140> so<00:00:46.710> I'll<00:00:46.860> turn

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
video clip using premiere so I'll turn

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:48.500 
video clip using premiere so I'll turn
this<00:00:47.340> on<00:00:47.520> as<00:00:47.640> soon<00:00:47.730> as<00:00:47.850> some<00:00:47.969> people<00:00:48.239> start

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
this on as soon as some people start

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.060 
this on as soon as some people start
showing<00:00:48.870> up<00:00:48.960> and<00:00:49.230> then<00:00:49.379> we'll<00:00:49.530> go<00:00:49.649> back<00:00:49.829> in<00:00:49.980> the

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
showing up and then we'll go back in the

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.500 
showing up and then we'll go back in the
computer<00:00:50.460> and<00:00:50.489> I'll<00:00:50.969> show<00:00:51.000> you<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:51.300> next

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
computer and I'll show you the next

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.330 
computer and I'll show you the next
steps<00:00:51.690> so<00:00:52.260> now<00:00:52.289> after<00:00:52.739> the<00:00:52.829> party<00:00:53.219> I<00:00:53.250> just

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
steps so now after the party I just

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.220 
steps so now after the party I just
imported<00:00:54.120> all<00:00:54.270> of<00:00:54.390> the<00:00:54.449> pictures<00:00:54.930> and<00:00:54.960> I

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
imported all of the pictures and I

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.099 
imported all of the pictures and I
realized<00:00:55.620> I<00:00:55.860> kind<00:00:56.309> of<00:00:56.399> blundered<00:00:57.360> big<00:00:57.629> time<00:00:57.870> I

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
realized I kind of blundered big time I

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.369 
realized I kind of blundered big time I
forgot<00:00:58.770> to<00:00:58.980> format<00:00:59.550> the<00:00:59.760> card<00:01:00.600> in<00:01:00.780> my<00:01:00.930> GoPro

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
forgot to format the card in my GoPro

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.500 
forgot to format the card in my GoPro
before<00:01:01.800> I<00:01:01.829> began<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.460> time-lapse<00:01:02.879> so<00:01:03.149> I<00:01:03.180> ran

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
before I began the time-lapse so I ran

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.240 
before I began the time-lapse so I ran
out<00:01:03.660> of<00:01:03.690> space<00:01:04.019> before<00:01:04.769> the<00:01:04.860> battery<00:01:05.189> died<00:01:05.369> so

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:07.250 
out of space before the battery died so

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:09.830 
out of space before the battery died so
time-lapse<00:01:08.250> 101<00:01:08.790> make<00:01:09.060> sure<00:01:09.240> your<00:01:09.390> card<00:01:09.689> is

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
time-lapse 101 make sure your card is

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.710 
time-lapse 101 make sure your card is
empty<00:01:09.990> but<00:01:10.920> still<00:01:11.369> in<00:01:11.549> any<00:01:11.670> case<00:01:11.939> I<00:01:12.119> got<00:01:12.360> three

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
empty but still in any case I got three

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.120 
empty but still in any case I got three
thousand<00:01:13.170> four<00:01:13.380> hundred<00:01:13.530> and<00:01:13.770> thirty<00:01:14.070> nine

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
thousand four hundred and thirty nine

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.840 
thousand four hundred and thirty nine
images<00:01:15.170> so<00:01:16.170> this<00:01:16.590> should<00:01:16.920> still<00:01:17.280> work<00:01:17.490> for<00:01:17.790> a

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
images so this should still work for a

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.640 
images so this should still work for a
pretty<00:01:18.330> good<00:01:18.570> time-lapse

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
pretty good time-lapse

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.640 
pretty good time-lapse
I<00:01:19.680> started<00:01:20.520> it<00:01:20.610> a<00:01:20.670> little<00:01:20.850> earlier<00:01:21.330> than<00:01:21.509> I

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:21.650 
I started it a little earlier than I

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:23.840 
I started it a little earlier than I
anticipated<00:01:22.650> I<00:01:23.009> was<00:01:23.159> hoping<00:01:23.430> it<00:01:23.549> would<00:01:23.670> run

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
anticipated I was hoping it would run

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.550 
anticipated I was hoping it would run
until<00:01:24.000> nighttime<00:01:24.479> so<00:01:24.900> I<00:01:24.930> couldn't<00:01:25.170> see<00:01:25.439> the

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
until nighttime so I couldn't see the

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.170 
until nighttime so I couldn't see the
transition<00:01:26.130> from<00:01:26.310> day<00:01:26.520> to<00:01:26.580> night<00:01:26.670> but<00:01:27.090> we

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
transition from day to night but we

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.929 
transition from day to night but we
didn't<00:01:27.390> quite<00:01:27.570> get<00:01:27.720> that<00:01:27.900> far<00:01:28.579> but<00:01:29.579> this<00:01:29.759> will

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
didn't quite get that far but this will

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.990 
didn't quite get that far but this will
work<00:01:30.090> so<00:01:30.930> the<00:01:31.650> first<00:01:31.860> thing<00:01:32.159> to<00:01:32.189> do<00:01:32.700> or<00:01:32.970> the

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
work so the first thing to do or the

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.969 
work so the first thing to do or the
first<00:01:33.329> thing<00:01:33.450> that<00:01:33.570> I<00:01:33.630> tend<00:01:33.930> to<00:01:34.020> do<00:01:34.259> is<00:01:34.470> go<00:01:34.740> into

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
first thing that I tend to do is go into

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.039 
first thing that I tend to do is go into
Lightroom<00:01:35.549> and<00:01:35.670> I'll<00:01:35.729> edit<00:01:35.939> one<00:01:36.780> of<00:01:36.810> these

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
Lightroom and I'll edit one of these

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:40.789 
Lightroom and I'll edit one of these
shots<00:01:37.790> this<00:01:38.790> is<00:01:38.850> kind<00:01:39.240> of<00:01:39.329> a<00:01:39.450> baseline<00:01:39.960> for<00:01:40.530> a

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
shots this is kind of a baseline for a

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.760 
shots this is kind of a baseline for a
day<00:01:41.250> so<00:01:41.820> it's<00:01:42.210> half<00:01:42.600> in<00:01:42.810> the<00:01:42.899> daylight<00:01:43.259> half<00:01:43.619> in

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
day so it's half in the daylight half in

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.039 
day so it's half in the daylight half in
the<00:01:43.860> shade<00:01:44.159> so<00:01:44.880> I'll<00:01:45.030> do<00:01:45.149> some<00:01:45.180> adjustments

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
the shade so I'll do some adjustments

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:49.850 
the shade so I'll do some adjustments
here<00:01:47.299> and<00:01:48.299> we'll<00:01:48.420> try<00:01:48.630> and<00:01:48.780> get<00:01:48.930> as<00:01:49.140> much<00:01:49.439> color

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
here and we'll try and get as much color

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.069 
here and we'll try and get as much color
information<00:01:50.250> out<00:01:50.850> of<00:01:50.880> this<00:01:51.180> as<00:01:51.420> we<00:01:51.570> can

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
information out of this as we can

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.800 
information out of this as we can
because<00:01:52.920> we<00:01:53.070> have<00:01:53.189> to<00:01:53.399> accommodate<00:01:54.060> for<00:01:54.329> the

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
because we have to accommodate for the

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.480 
because we have to accommodate for the
change<00:01:55.200> in<00:01:55.470> time<00:01:57.680> so<00:01:58.680> that<00:01:58.710> should<00:01:59.250> work

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
change in time so that should work

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:04.160 
change in time so that should work
pretty<00:02:00.270> well<00:02:00.450> for<00:02:02.630> after<00:02:03.630> so<00:02:03.780> that<00:02:03.899> will<00:02:04.049> give

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
pretty well for after so that will give

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.280 
pretty well for after so that will give
us<00:02:04.320> some<00:02:04.649> more<00:02:04.860> color<00:02:05.430> or<00:02:05.880> more<00:02:06.290> information

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
us some more color or more information

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:08.630 
us some more color or more information
in<00:02:07.380> the<00:02:07.469> blown<00:02:07.680> out<00:02:07.829> areas<00:02:08.160> because<00:02:08.369> I<00:02:08.459> have

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
in the blown out areas because I have

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.240 
in the blown out areas because I have
recovery<00:02:09.360> bit<00:02:09.599> on<00:02:09.869> all<00:02:10.110> the<00:02:10.229> way<00:02:10.379> and<00:02:10.709> it

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
recovery bit on all the way and it

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.309 
recovery bit on all the way and it
should<00:02:11.430> push<00:02:11.819> up<00:02:12.060> some<00:02:12.390> of<00:02:12.510> the

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
should push up some of the

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:15.290 
should push up some of the
so<00:02:14.069> it<00:02:14.190> should<00:02:14.430> maintain<00:02:14.640> a<00:02:14.940> pretty

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
so it should maintain a pretty

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:16.940 
so it should maintain a pretty
consistent<00:02:15.630> him<00:02:15.870> at<00:02:16.020> these<00:02:16.170> settings<00:02:16.620> should

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
consistent him at these settings should

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.309 
consistent him at these settings should
work<00:02:17.430> pretty<00:02:17.790> well<00:02:17.940> throughout<00:02:18.540> the<00:02:18.690> entire

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 
work pretty well throughout the entire

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:21.589 
work pretty well throughout the entire
range<00:02:19.739> and<00:02:20.730> now<00:02:20.940> since<00:02:21.180> we're<00:02:21.300> going<00:02:21.420> to<00:02:21.540> be

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:21.599 
range and now since we're going to be

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:23.809 
range and now since we're going to be
using<00:02:22.020> this<00:02:22.170> for<00:02:22.709> a<00:02:22.739> time<00:02:23.099> lapse<00:02:23.340> which<00:02:23.670> will

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
using this for a time lapse which will

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:26.660 
using this for a time lapse which will
be<00:02:23.940> 1080p<00:02:24.660> video<00:02:25.020> we<00:02:25.770> will<00:02:26.010> want<00:02:26.190> to<00:02:26.280> crop

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
be 1080p video we will want to crop

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.490 
be 1080p video we will want to crop
these<00:02:26.880> a<00:02:27.030> time<00:02:27.150> when<00:02:27.270> we<00:02:27.360> export<00:02:27.989> they'll<00:02:28.349> be

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
these a time when we export they'll be

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.229 
these a time when we export they'll be
the<00:02:28.620> right<00:02:28.800> resolution<00:02:28.980> and<00:02:29.640> it'll<00:02:29.790> just<00:02:29.970> be

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:30.239 
the right resolution and it'll just be

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:31.160 
the right resolution and it'll just be
easier

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
easier

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:37.550 
easier
so<00:02:31.920> crop<00:02:32.550> I've<00:02:33.209> created<00:02:33.569> a<00:02:33.780> custom<00:02:35.269> crop<00:02:36.560> ratio

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
so crop I've created a custom crop ratio

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.759 
so crop I've created a custom crop ratio
here<00:02:37.860> so<00:02:38.550> sixteen<00:02:39.150> by<00:02:39.300> nine<00:02:39.410> that's<00:02:40.410> what<00:02:40.650> we

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:40.769 
here so sixteen by nine that's what we

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:43.850 
here so sixteen by nine that's what we
want<00:02:41.360> and<00:02:42.360> something<00:02:43.200> like<00:02:43.230> that<00:02:43.410> we<00:02:43.680> don't

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
want and something like that we don't

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.570 
want and something like that we don't
need<00:02:43.950> as<00:02:44.099> much<00:02:44.310> of<00:02:44.370> this<00:02:44.640> boring<00:02:45.180> roof<00:02:45.569> and

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:46.580 
need as much of this boring roof and

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:49.580 
need as much of this boring roof and
that<00:02:47.580> will<00:02:47.790> work<00:02:47.970> alright<00:02:48.870> perfect

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
that will work alright perfect

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.009 
that will work alright perfect
so<00:02:49.980> now<00:02:50.130> we<00:02:50.190> want<00:02:50.549> to<00:02:50.790> select<00:02:51.269> all<00:02:51.750> of<00:02:51.900> our

00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:52.019 
so now we want to select all of our

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:54.949 
so now we want to select all of our
images<00:02:52.470> so<00:02:52.680> you<00:02:52.739> go<00:02:53.010> down<00:02:53.160> to<00:02:53.250> the<00:02:53.750> film<00:02:54.750> strip

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
images so you go down to the film strip

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:57.140 
images so you go down to the film strip
down<00:02:55.140> here<00:02:55.410> press<00:02:55.650> ctrl-a<00:02:56.220> which<00:02:56.730> highlights

down here press ctrl-a which highlights

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.509 
down here press ctrl-a which highlights
everything<00:02:57.420> and<00:02:57.810> then<00:02:57.930> control<00:02:58.440> shift<00:02:58.470> s<00:02:59.099> and

00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519 
everything and then control shift s and

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:01.789 
everything and then control shift s and
then<00:03:00.239> we'll<00:03:00.420> synchronize<00:03:01.019> these<00:03:01.260> settings

00:03:01.789 --> 00:03:01.799 
then we'll synchronize these settings

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:04.460 
then we'll synchronize these settings
across<00:03:02.250> all<00:03:02.610> of<00:03:02.760> our<00:03:02.849> images<00:03:03.269> and<00:03:03.480> now<00:03:04.230> that<00:03:04.380> we

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
across all of our images and now that we

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:07.580 
across all of our images and now that we
have<00:03:04.500> all<00:03:05.310> of<00:03:05.370> our<00:03:05.790> images<00:03:06.269> in<00:03:06.480> sync<00:03:07.200> settings

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
have all of our images in sync settings

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:11.089 
have all of our images in sync settings
wise<00:03:08.190> we'll<00:03:09.030> select<00:03:09.599> them<00:03:09.930> all<00:03:10.080> again<00:03:10.380> ctrl<00:03:10.890> a

00:03:11.089 --> 00:03:11.099 
wise we'll select them all again ctrl a

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:14.470 
wise we'll select them all again ctrl a
and<00:03:11.370> we'll<00:03:12.090> begin<00:03:12.239> the<00:03:12.480> export<00:03:13.019> process<00:03:13.260> so

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 
and we'll begin the export process so

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:19.940 
and we'll begin the export process so
we'll<00:03:15.480> export<00:03:16.349> these<00:03:17.209> at<00:03:18.209> 1920<00:03:19.200> and<00:03:19.320> because

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
we'll export these at 1920 and because

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:22.280 
we'll export these at 1920 and because
they're<00:03:20.640> in<00:03:20.760> the<00:03:20.850> correct<00:03:21.000> aspect<00:03:21.299> ratio<00:03:21.630> it

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
they're in the correct aspect ratio it

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.050 
they're in the correct aspect ratio it
should<00:03:22.590> automatically<00:03:23.220> put<00:03:23.489> the<00:03:23.609> other<00:03:23.790> edge

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
should automatically put the other edge

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:29.180 
should automatically put the other edge
at<00:03:24.769> 1080<00:03:25.769> and<00:03:26.720> then<00:03:27.720> we<00:03:28.530> don't<00:03:28.769> really<00:03:28.950> need

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
at 1080 and then we don't really need

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:32.030 
at 1080 and then we don't really need
much<00:03:30.200> post-processing<00:03:31.200> we<00:03:31.680> don't<00:03:31.859> need<00:03:31.980> a

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
much post-processing we don't need a

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.870 
much post-processing we don't need a
watermark<00:03:32.609> want<00:03:33.510> to<00:03:33.600> export<00:03:33.989> these<00:03:34.430> as<00:03:35.430> fast

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
watermark want to export these as fast

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:38.270 
watermark want to export these as fast
as<00:03:36.120> possible<00:03:36.750> because<00:03:36.989> there's<00:03:37.380> three<00:03:38.100> and<00:03:38.190> a

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
as possible because there's three and a

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.910 
as possible because there's three and a
half<00:03:38.459> thousand<00:03:39.090> of<00:03:39.239> them<00:03:39.440> and<00:03:40.440> then<00:03:40.680> we'll

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
half thousand of them and then we'll

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:42.559 
half thousand of them and then we'll
choose<00:03:41.130> our<00:03:41.280> folder<00:03:41.670> and<00:03:41.880> we'll<00:03:42.120> begin<00:03:42.299> the

00:03:42.559 --> 00:03:42.569 
choose our folder and we'll begin the

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:46.970 
choose our folder and we'll begin the
export<00:03:43.049> process<00:03:44.930> so<00:03:45.930> I<00:03:45.959> have<00:03:46.230> a<00:03:46.260> folder

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 
export process so I have a folder

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:49.210 
export process so I have a folder
specifically<00:03:47.579> for<00:03:47.790> this<00:03:47.940> and<00:03:48.209> we'll<00:03:48.870> begin

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:49.220 
specifically for this and we'll begin

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:51.710 
specifically for this and we'll begin
alright<00:03:50.220> so<00:03:50.370> now<00:03:50.519> I've<00:03:50.639> created<00:03:51.209> a<00:03:51.480> new

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
alright so now I've created a new

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:54.440 
alright so now I've created a new
project<00:03:52.590> in<00:03:52.920> Adobe<00:03:53.280> Premiere<00:03:53.310> Pro<00:03:53.700> this<00:03:54.329> is

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
project in Adobe Premiere Pro this is

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:55.970 
project in Adobe Premiere Pro this is
where<00:03:54.569> we're<00:03:54.720> going<00:03:54.930> to<00:03:55.109> create<00:03:55.440> our<00:03:55.530> actual

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 
where we're going to create our actual

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:58.640 
where we're going to create our actual
time-lapse<00:03:56.700> so<00:03:57.690> what<00:03:57.900> you<00:03:58.019> need<00:03:58.139> to<00:03:58.200> do<00:03:58.440> to

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
time-lapse so what you need to do to

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:01.610 
time-lapse so what you need to do to
create<00:03:58.950> a<00:03:59.459> new<00:03:59.940> time-lapse<00:04:00.540> is<00:04:00.810> right<00:04:01.260> click

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:01.620 
create a new time-lapse is right click

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:05.599 
create a new time-lapse is right click
on<00:04:01.859> your<00:04:01.920> project<00:04:02.540> area<00:04:03.540> and<00:04:03.780> say<00:04:04.019> import<00:04:04.709> then

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:05.609 
on your project area and say import then

00:04:05.609 --> 00:04:07.940 
on your project area and say import then
find<00:04:06.090> the<00:04:06.329> folder<00:04:06.630> that<00:04:06.840> your<00:04:07.109> time-lapse<00:04:07.440> is

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:07.950 
find the folder that your time-lapse is

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:11.140 
find the folder that your time-lapse is
in<00:04:08.280> click<00:04:09.209> on<00:04:09.359> the<00:04:09.480> first<00:04:09.870> one<00:04:10.019> and<00:04:10.500> then<00:04:10.680> this

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:11.150 
in click on the first one and then this

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:14.809 
in click on the first one and then this
image<00:04:12.150> sequence<00:04:12.959> if<00:04:13.230> you<00:04:13.440> check<00:04:14.040> the<00:04:14.220> checkbox

00:04:14.809 --> 00:04:14.819 
image sequence if you check the checkbox

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:18.560 
image sequence if you check the checkbox
and<00:04:15.150> say<00:04:15.959> open<00:04:16.519> then<00:04:17.519> voila<00:04:18.030> you'll

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:18.570 
and say open then voila you'll

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:20.690 
and say open then voila you'll
automatically<00:04:19.350> have<00:04:19.590> a<00:04:19.620> time-lapse<00:04:20.160> that

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:20.700 
automatically have a time-lapse that

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:22.850 
automatically have a time-lapse that
contains<00:04:21.539> all<00:04:21.750> the<00:04:21.989> images<00:04:22.380> in<00:04:22.530> that<00:04:22.800> folder

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.860 
contains all the images in that folder

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:26.240 
contains all the images in that folder
it's<00:04:23.729> that<00:04:23.970> easy<00:04:24.180> and<00:04:24.710> then<00:04:25.710> you<00:04:25.740> can<00:04:25.919> drag<00:04:26.130> it

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:26.250 
it's that easy and then you can drag it

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:26.840 
it's that easy and then you can drag it
onto<00:04:26.370> your<00:04:26.520> time

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:26.850 
onto your time

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:31.250 
onto your time
and<00:04:28.310> you<00:04:29.310> have<00:04:29.490> a<00:04:29.520> time-lapse<00:04:30.450> put<00:04:31.110> together

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:31.260 
and you have a time-lapse put together

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:34.070 
and you have a time-lapse put together
this<00:04:31.710> is<00:04:31.890> saying<00:04:32.190> it's<00:04:33.150> about<00:04:33.300> 2<00:04:33.690> minutes<00:04:33.870> and

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:34.080 
this is saying it's about 2 minutes and

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:37.820 
this is saying it's about 2 minutes and
22<00:04:34.590> seconds<00:04:35.070> and<00:04:35.490> it's<00:04:36.480> at<00:04:36.600> 24<00:04:37.290> frames<00:04:37.710> per

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:37.830 
22 seconds and it's at 24 frames per

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:40.820 
22 seconds and it's at 24 frames per
second<00:04:38.370> but<00:04:38.580> what<00:04:39.060> happens<00:04:39.390> if<00:04:39.660> 2<00:04:40.440> minutes<00:04:40.710> and

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:40.830 
second but what happens if 2 minutes and

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:42.230 
second but what happens if 2 minutes and
24<00:04:41.130> seconds<00:04:41.460> is<00:04:41.610> too<00:04:41.640> long<00:04:41.940> for<00:04:42.120> this

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:42.240 
24 seconds is too long for this

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:44.960 
24 seconds is too long for this
time-lapse<00:04:42.480> and<00:04:42.960> we<00:04:43.680> want<00:04:43.920> 60<00:04:44.610> frames<00:04:44.850> a

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:44.970 
time-lapse and we want 60 frames a

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:47.380 
time-lapse and we want 60 frames a
second<00:04:45.360> well<00:04:45.810> you<00:04:45.930> can<00:04:46.050> do<00:04:46.230> that<00:04:46.260> also

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:47.390 
second well you can do that also

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:50.060 
second well you can do that also
and<00:04:48.390> we'll<00:04:48.690> nuke<00:04:49.320> this<00:04:49.530> guy<00:04:49.740> from<00:04:49.920> our

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:50.070 
and we'll nuke this guy from our

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:54.320 
and we'll nuke this guy from our
timeline<00:04:51.260> the<00:04:52.260> import<00:04:53.040> settings<00:04:53.460> oddly

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:54.330 
timeline the import settings oddly

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:57.050 
timeline the import settings oddly
enough<00:04:54.420> you<00:04:54.660> can't<00:04:54.960> control<00:04:55.470> them<00:04:55.650> from<00:04:56.070> here

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:57.060 
enough you can't control them from here

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:59.600 
enough you can't control them from here
if<00:04:57.240> you<00:04:57.960> want<00:04:58.140> to<00:04:58.230> change<00:04:58.440> the<00:04:58.800> frame<00:04:59.130> rate<00:04:59.190> at

00:04:59.600 --> 00:04:59.610 
if you want to change the frame rate at

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:02.270 
if you want to change the frame rate at
which<00:04:59.640> they're<00:05:00.000> imported<00:05:00.690> it's<00:05:00.870> a<00:05:01.160> kind<00:05:02.160> of

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:02.280 
which they're imported it's a kind of

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:04.520 
which they're imported it's a kind of
premiere<00:05:03.240> level<00:05:03.630> change<00:05:04.020> so<00:05:04.200> you<00:05:04.260> have<00:05:04.350> to<00:05:04.410> go

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:04.530 
premiere level change so you have to go

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:08.120 
premiere level change so you have to go
into<00:05:04.800> the<00:05:04.920> main<00:05:05.190> preferences<00:05:06.440> and<00:05:07.440> I<00:05:07.950> think

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:08.130 
into the main preferences and I think

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:10.520 
into the main preferences and I think
it's<00:05:08.280> playback<00:05:09.230> nope

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:10.530 
it's playback nope

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:15.050 
it's playback nope
it<00:05:10.830> is<00:05:11.040> media<00:05:11.550> and<00:05:12.710> the<00:05:13.710> intermediate<00:05:14.160> media

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:15.060 
it is media and the intermediate media

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:17.000 
it is media and the intermediate media
time<00:05:15.600> base<00:05:15.900> whatever<00:05:16.350> the<00:05:16.620> hell<00:05:16.770> that<00:05:16.800> means

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:17.010 
time base whatever the hell that means

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:19.700 
time base whatever the hell that means
that's<00:05:17.580> what<00:05:17.820> does<00:05:18.030> it<00:05:18.210> so<00:05:18.810> if<00:05:18.900> we<00:05:19.050> change<00:05:19.320> this

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:19.710 
that's what does it so if we change this

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:22.850 
that's what does it so if we change this
now<00:05:20.220> to<00:05:20.280> 60<00:05:21.150> frames<00:05:21.300> per<00:05:21.660> second<00:05:22.080> and<00:05:22.260> say<00:05:22.470> ok

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:22.860 
now to 60 frames per second and say ok

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:26.390 
now to 60 frames per second and say ok
we'll<00:05:23.850> do<00:05:23.970> the<00:05:24.060> exact<00:05:24.450> same<00:05:24.540> import<00:05:25.400> select

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:26.400 
we'll do the exact same import select

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:30.070 
we'll do the exact same import select
the<00:05:26.550> first<00:05:26.760> image<00:05:26.910> image<00:05:27.630> sequence<00:05:28.140> ok<00:05:28.860> and

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:30.080 
the first image image sequence ok and

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:33.590 
the first image image sequence ok and
now<00:05:31.080> where<00:05:31.650> this<00:05:32.250> was<00:05:32.490> imported<00:05:32.970> at<00:05:33.030> 60<00:05:33.480> frames

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:33.600 
now where this was imported at 60 frames

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:35.870 
now where this was imported at 60 frames
a<00:05:33.840> second<00:05:34.200> and<00:05:34.380> instead<00:05:35.070> of<00:05:35.190> being<00:05:35.400> 2<00:05:35.640> minutes

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:35.880 
a second and instead of being 2 minutes

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:38.510 
a second and instead of being 2 minutes
and<00:05:36.000> 23<00:05:36.270> seconds<00:05:36.870> its<00:05:37.110> 57<00:05:37.920> seconds<00:05:38.340> that's

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:38.520 
and 23 seconds its 57 seconds that's

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:41.360 
and 23 seconds its 57 seconds that's
much<00:05:38.700> better<00:05:39.380> so<00:05:40.380> we<00:05:40.500> can<00:05:40.530> drop<00:05:40.830> that<00:05:40.860> onto<00:05:41.190> our

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:41.370 
much better so we can drop that onto our

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:45.230 
much better so we can drop that onto our
timeline<00:05:41.910> and<00:05:42.150> watch<00:05:42.840> it<00:05:43.020> again<00:05:44.090> you<00:05:45.090> can

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:45.240 
timeline and watch it again you can

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:46.970 
timeline and watch it again you can
press<00:05:45.450> spacebar<00:05:45.840> and<00:05:46.200> watch<00:05:46.350> it<00:05:46.500> at<00:05:46.590> any<00:05:46.710> point

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:46.980 
press spacebar and watch it at any point

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:49.010 
press spacebar and watch it at any point
in<00:05:47.070> time<00:05:47.100> and<00:05:47.550> you<00:05:48.000> kind<00:05:48.240> of<00:05:48.300> get<00:05:48.450> an<00:05:48.570> idea<00:05:48.630> of

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:49.020 
in time and you kind of get an idea of

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:52.040 
in time and you kind of get an idea of
how<00:05:49.290> this<00:05:49.590> works<00:05:49.950> it's<00:05:50.430> really<00:05:51.270> that<00:05:51.450> easy<00:05:51.780> in

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:52.050 
how this works it's really that easy in

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:55.580 
how this works it's really that easy in
Premiere<00:05:52.500> so<00:05:53.460> I<00:05:53.490> just<00:05:53.970> wish<00:05:54.150> I<00:05:54.330> had<00:05:54.570> my<00:05:55.110> GoPro

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:55.590 
Premiere so I just wish I had my GoPro

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:57.770 
Premiere so I just wish I had my GoPro
going<00:05:55.950> the<00:05:56.130> entire<00:05:56.280> time<00:05:57.060> so<00:05:57.090> we<00:05:57.570> would<00:05:57.720> have

00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:57.780 
going the entire time so we would have

00:05:57.780 --> 00:05:59.570 
going the entire time so we would have
been<00:05:57.900> able<00:05:57.990> to<00:05:58.140> see<00:05:58.530> the<00:05:58.650> transition<00:05:59.040> tonight

00:05:59.570 --> 00:05:59.580 
been able to see the transition tonight

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:01.670 
been able to see the transition tonight
and<00:05:59.820> see<00:05:59.940> how<00:06:00.180> the<00:06:00.240> GoPros<00:06:00.870> ISO<00:06:01.230> worked<00:06:01.530> at

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:01.680 
and see how the GoPros ISO worked at

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:05.060 
and see how the GoPros ISO worked at
night<00:06:01.860> meant<00:06:02.100> with<00:06:02.970> a<00:06:03.000> time-lapse<00:06:03.570> but<00:06:04.070> this

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:05.070 
night meant with a time-lapse but this

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:07.610 
night meant with a time-lapse but this
is<00:06:05.220> OK<00:06:05.520> I<00:06:05.730> mean<00:06:06.570> the<00:06:06.720> party<00:06:07.050> was<00:06:07.230> barely

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:07.620 
is OK I mean the party was barely

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:10.550 
is OK I mean the party was barely
getting<00:06:07.800> started<00:06:08.520> by<00:06:08.640> the<00:06:08.700> time<00:06:08.940> this<00:06:09.560> ended

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:10.560 
getting started by the time this ended

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:12.290 
getting started by the time this ended

footage<00:06:12.690> but<00:06:13.110> other<00:06:14.040> than<00:06:14.220> that<00:06:14.280> I<00:06:14.610> think<00:06:14.940> this

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:15.060 
footage but other than that I think this

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:15.830 
footage but other than that I think this
