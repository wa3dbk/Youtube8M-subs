 and if boomerang invented in Russia 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:45.350
 Why do we have a boomerang from the rake that's 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:51.470
 Basically, the exam has already passed 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:54.710

 let's be sober lifestyle but in principle 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:39.560
 then by car there is not much but 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:43.010
 I would like to remind you that on the channel 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:46.090
 a competition is being called rather it is not 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:49.640
 competition is a joke just a joke 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:54.709
 many ask well there are such 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:57.620
 write would not say scam 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:03:00.410
 is when you buy tickets give away 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:03.489
 your money here you do not give anything 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:05.510
 you just subscribe to the channel and 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:09.340
 do repost 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:13.250
 that is so that other people also learn about 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:15.230
 channel yes it is for bringing later 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:18.140
 poll people are mistaken 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:21.310
 they say why the competition is not done for 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:24.739
 Subscribers to a contest so much for 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:27.450

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:31.060

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:34.720
