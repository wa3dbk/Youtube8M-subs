if we lose unlocking

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:21.920
device that our data are
insurance

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:25.260
but he knew he could expose not only
a numerical code but also a

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.050
code with letters if you leave the settings
tacher and Vicky code

if we go to Paris and Ischia fear

00:00:44.339 --> 00:00:49.059
left the right side will appear
When sending that message if the

tough group for surely already
but you may know the guys

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.199
Indeed we can take pictures
simply pressing

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.479
the button must do more if we are
writing a text and we realize

00:00:59.479 --> 00:01:02.869
that we were wrong or
simply doing so will be able

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:07.380
and if we want to give it back
waving will not be able to undo

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.799
deleted so that is an option
if you delete some quite chulapón

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:14.310
thing when we mistakenly fabric and
we have always reckoning

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.850
we tend to use the calculator but
know that this vitamin calculator

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.430
k and may be a calculator
scientific

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.120
simply killed our
let's see device

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:27.960
more options than we had in
natively if we are a website

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.659
that under exploration by facemos
down down

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:34.069
and we can back to top
do an instant way

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:37.819
We can simply tap on the vine
it's all the time in the bar

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:42.069

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:46.010
computer

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:49.040

Desktop mode

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:58.290
this is a very trivial thing but my
first there when tito is that sooner

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:59.850
enough to discover it

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.810
You know you can put the case

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.159
Chaves make it clear you have the option
cycle if you give write the first

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:09.310
technical first letter capitalized
but it is to write all the text

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:13.130
capitalized stakes in touch eta

all the way down we choose option

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.750
stop

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.770
so when the playback tempo
please assume current 30 minutes

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:38.540
but it's not going to beep alarm
but will simply stop watching

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.520
Play what we are
listening and something else that I love

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.300
the guys who are going to suffer their power

let's posts

00:03:03.779 --> 00:03:07.639
accessibility and we go here
