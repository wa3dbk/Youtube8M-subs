00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
with the deck it's actually a little bit

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.450 
with the deck it's actually a little bit
too<00:01:58.200> short<00:01:58.530> for<00:01:59.310> doing<00:02:00.030> far<00:02:00.509> over<00:02:00.840> tricks<00:02:01.460> so

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
too short for doing far over tricks so

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:03.920
