because i was trying to sweep up the
streets<00:02:14.700> and<00:02:15.000> people<00:02:15.180> take<00:02:15.450> my<00:02:15.690> picture<00:02:16.140> but

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.800 
streets and people take my picture but
once<00:02:17.250> i<00:02:17.370> realized<00:02:17.610> that<00:02:18.000> i<00:02:18.150> was<00:02:18.240> giving<00:02:18.630> them

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
once i realized that i was giving them

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.780 
once i realized that i was giving them
what<00:02:18.930> they<00:02:18.960> wanted<00:02:19.470> obviously<00:02:20.430> I<00:02:20.460> thought

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
what they wanted obviously I thought

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.370 
what they wanted obviously I thought
this<00:02:21.480> is<00:02:21.540> not<00:02:21.780> going<00:02:21.900> to<00:02:21.960> make<00:02:22.080> it<00:02:22.140> any<00:02:22.320> easier

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
this is not going to make it any easier

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.650 
this is not going to make it any easier
by<00:02:22.710> being<00:02:22.950> a<00:02:23.040> queen<00:02:23.310> and<00:02:24.030> so<00:02:24.180> I<00:02:24.240> decided<00:02:24.570> just

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
by being a queen and so I decided just

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.000 
by being a queen and so I decided just
to<00:02:24.810> get<00:02:24.990> on<00:02:25.020> with<00:02:25.230> it<00:02:25.260> and<00:02:25.380> ignore<00:02:25.560> them<00:02:25.920> and

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
to get on with it and ignore them and

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.940 
to get on with it and ignore them and
made<00:02:26.340> it<00:02:26.460> a<00:02:26.490> lot<00:02:26.580> easier<00:02:26.930> okay<00:02:27.930> and<00:02:28.530> look<00:02:28.740> for

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
made it a lot easier okay and look for

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.240 
made it a lot easier okay and look for
someone<00:02:29.190> that's<00:02:29.400> seen<00:02:29.640> a<00:02:29.670> lot<00:02:30.060> obviously<00:02:30.210> of

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250 
someone that's seen a lot obviously of

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.890 
someone that's seen a lot obviously of
the<00:02:32.250> industry<00:02:32.760> that's<00:02:33.060> why<00:02:33.300> we<00:02:33.450> were<00:02:33.570> certain

someone<00:02:41.460> that<00:02:41.580> scene<00:02:42.270> I<00:02:42.660> guess<00:02:42.840> a<00:02:42.870> lot<00:02:43.230> in<00:02:43.440> the

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
someone that scene I guess a lot in the

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.620 
someone that scene I guess a lot in the
day<00:02:43.680> what<00:02:43.890> do<00:02:43.950> you<00:02:44.010> think<00:02:44.220> of<00:02:44.340> pop<00:02:45.060> music<00:02:45.210> like

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630

modern pop music today is it something

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:49.730 
modern pop music today is it something
that<00:02:47.850> and<00:02:48.209> I<00:02:48.840> don't<00:02:48.870> think<00:02:49.320> it's<00:02:49.470> really<00:02:49.709> a

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:49.740 
that and I don't think it's really a

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:51.530 
that and I don't think it's really a
place<00:02:50.010> where<00:02:50.220> you<00:02:50.280> can<00:02:50.520> be<00:02:50.730> experimental

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
place where you can be experimental

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.110 
place where you can be experimental
anymore<00:02:51.990> so<00:02:52.980> for<00:02:53.220> someone<00:02:53.459> like<00:02:53.550> me<00:02:53.730> it's<00:02:53.880> not

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
anymore so for someone like me it's not

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.520 
anymore so for someone like me it's not
that<00:02:54.420> easy<00:02:54.950> because<00:02:55.950> you<00:02:56.490> know<00:02:56.580> my<00:02:57.320> my<00:02:58.320> whole

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
that easy because you know my my whole

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.710 
that easy because you know my my whole
kind<00:02:58.680> of<00:02:58.860> reason<00:02:59.280> for<00:02:59.580> being<00:02:59.880> creative<00:03:00.390> is<00:03:00.510> to

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
kind of reason for being creative is to

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.410 
kind of reason for being creative is to
express<00:03:01.110> myself<00:03:01.410> into<00:03:01.920> kind<00:03:02.130> of<00:03:02.250> you<00:03:02.370> know

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
discover and I think we've reached a

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:21.680 
discover and I think we've reached a
point<00:03:19.230> now<00:03:19.560> where<00:03:19.590> we<00:03:20.130> know<00:03:21.030> how<00:03:21.239> to<00:03:21.300> make<00:03:21.570> the

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
point now where we know how to make the
