right side or the wrong side now the
first<00:00:54.930> thing<00:00:55.079> we<00:00:55.199> need<00:00:55.350> after<00:00:55.860> that<00:00:55.980> the<00:00:56.100> first

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
first thing we need after that the first

first thing we need after that the first
we<00:00:56.430> need<00:00:56.579> to<00:00:56.670> do<00:00:56.760> is<00:00:56.940> to<00:00:57.149> trim<00:00:57.809> one<00:00:58.140> side<00:00:58.440> of<00:00:58.590> the

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
we need to do is to trim one side of the

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.029 
we need to do is to trim one side of the
theme<00:00:58.940> about<00:00:59.940> three<00:01:00.870> or<00:01:00.960> four<00:01:01.140> millimeters

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
theme about three or four millimeters

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.479 
theme about three or four millimeters
and<00:01:02.329> then<00:01:03.329> we're<00:01:03.780> going<00:01:03.989> to<00:01:04.049> press<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:05.189> other

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
and then we're going to press the other

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.539 
and then we're going to press the other
seam<00:01:05.670> allowance<00:01:06.119> in<00:01:06.720> half<00:01:07.650> all<00:01:08.010> the<00:01:08.070> way<00:01:08.220> down

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
seam allowance in half all the way down

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.760 
seam allowance in half all the way down
and<00:01:08.790> then<00:01:09.150> last<00:01:09.390> is<00:01:09.510> going<00:01:09.659> to<00:01:09.720> come<00:01:09.930> over<00:01:10.170> to

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
and then last is going to come over to

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.320 
and then last is going to come over to
cover<00:01:10.979> the<00:01:11.130> raw<00:01:11.280> edge<00:01:11.549> of<00:01:11.760> the<00:01:12.330> under<00:01:13.110> seam

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:14.330 
cover the raw edge of the under seam

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:18.560 
cover the raw edge of the under seam
I've<00:01:15.330> now<00:01:15.570> trimmed<00:01:16.020> one<00:01:16.740> seam<00:01:17.220> allowance<00:01:17.670> as

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
I've now trimmed one seam allowance as

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.920 
I've now trimmed one seam allowance as
you<00:01:18.689> can<00:01:18.840> see<00:01:19.020> here<00:01:19.320> and<00:01:19.530> I<00:01:20.280> folded<00:01:20.700> over<00:01:21.060> the

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
you can see here and I folded over the

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.859 
you can see here and I folded over the
other<00:01:22.080> so<00:01:22.830> the<00:01:23.040> under<00:01:23.369> seam<00:01:23.689> allowance<00:01:24.689> is

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
other so the under seam allowance is

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.560 
other so the under seam allowance is
trimmed<00:01:25.229> the<00:01:25.650> top<00:01:25.950> seam<00:01:26.340> allowance<00:01:26.909> has<00:01:27.270> been

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
trimmed the top seam allowance has been

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.569 
trimmed the top seam allowance has been
folded<00:01:27.990> in<00:01:28.110> half<00:01:28.290> all<00:01:28.619> the<00:01:28.680> way<00:01:29.040> down<00:01:29.369> and

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
folded in half all the way down and

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:34.740 
folded in half all the way down and
pressed<00:01:29.909> and<00:01:30.409> the<00:01:31.409> next<00:01:31.710> step<00:01:31.950> is<00:01:32.310> to

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:34.750 
pressed and the next step is to

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:38.550 
pressed and the next step is to
cover<00:01:35.440> the<00:01:35.650> raw<00:01:35.860> edge<00:01:36.450> of<00:01:37.450> the<00:01:38.020> under<00:01:38.380> seam

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:38.560 
cover the raw edge of the under seam

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:45.950 
cover the raw edge of the under seam
allowance<00:01:39.210> and<00:01:40.210> pin<00:01:41.140> that<00:01:41.170> into<00:01:41.470> place<00:01:43.560> opens

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
allowance and pin that into place opens

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.880 
allowance and pin that into place opens
em<00:01:47.460> so<00:01:48.460> we're<00:01:48.610> just<00:01:48.820> covering<00:01:49.620> the<00:01:50.620> raw<00:01:50.740> edge

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:50.890 
em so we're just covering the raw edge

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:55.730 
em so we're just covering the raw edge
because<00:01:51.100> then<00:01:51.280> we're<00:01:51.460> going<00:01:51.640> to<00:01:53.130> edge<00:01:54.130> stitch

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
because then we're going to edge stitch

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.090 
because then we're going to edge stitch
so<00:01:56.740> we're<00:01:56.860> going<00:01:56.950> to<00:01:57.040> sew<00:01:57.220> very<00:01:57.400> close<00:01:57.790> to<00:01:58.180> the

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
so we're going to sew very close to the

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.800 
so we're going to sew very close to the
folded<00:02:00.720> edge<00:02:01.720> of<00:02:01.750> the<00:02:02.020> seam<00:02:02.200> allowance

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
folded edge of the seam allowance

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.480 
folded edge of the seam allowance
there's<00:02:04.810> one<00:02:04.990> more<00:02:05.200> and<00:02:05.500> you<00:02:05.920> can<00:02:06.010> also<00:02:06.160> base

close<00:02:18.790> to<00:02:19.150> the<00:02:19.510> edge<00:02:19.810> this<00:02:20.350> reason<00:02:20.620> why<00:02:20.710> it's

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830 
close to the edge this reason why it's

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:23.160 
close to the edge this reason why it's
called<00:02:20.860> an<00:02:21.100> edge<00:02:21.310> stitch<00:02:21.490> now<00:02:22.330> you<00:02:22.390> can<00:02:22.690> use<00:02:22.960> a

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
called an edge stitch now you can use a

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:26.400 
called an edge stitch now you can use a
bigger<00:02:23.530> stitch<00:02:23.920> if<00:02:24.190> you<00:02:24.430> wish<00:02:24.640> and<00:02:25.290> you<00:02:26.290> can

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.840 

just<00:02:41.530> make<00:02:41.710> sure<00:02:41.740> that<00:02:42.190> you're<00:02:42.370> on<00:02:42.400> the<00:02:42.580> edge

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:42.850 
just make sure that you're on the edge

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
just make sure that you're on the edge
of<00:02:43.450> that<00:02:43.840> folded<00:02:44.830> seam<00:02:45.070> allowance<00:02:45.520> I<00:02:48.570> now<00:02:49.570> have

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
of that folded seam allowance I now have

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:52.170 
of that folded seam allowance I now have
the<00:02:50.140> flat<00:02:50.440> felled<00:02:50.740> seam<00:02:50.950> complete<00:02:51.640> it's<00:02:51.910> also

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
the flat felled seam complete it's also

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:55.080 
the flat felled seam complete it's also
referred<00:02:52.630> to<00:02:52.660> as<00:02:52.840> a<00:02:53.140> felled<00:02:53.500> seam<00:02:53.800> and<00:02:54.040> a<00:02:54.550> 1<00:02:54.850> M

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090 
referred to as a felled seam and a 1 M

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:57.540 
referred to as a felled seam and a 1 M
fell<00:02:55.360> seam<00:02:55.720> now<00:02:56.470> this<00:02:56.740> is<00:02:56.890> the<00:02:57.010> side<00:02:57.220> in<00:02:57.520> which

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:57.550 
fell seam now this is the side in which

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:00.810 
fell seam now this is the side in which
I<00:02:57.850> actually<00:02:57.970> did<00:02:58.540> the<00:02:59.140> process<00:02:59.709> of<00:02:59.950> trimming

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:00.820 
I actually did the process of trimming

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:03.660 
I actually did the process of trimming
and<00:03:01.180> named<00:03:01.510> chin<00:03:02.080> over<00:03:02.530> in<00:03:03.160> order<00:03:03.310> to<00:03:03.400> do<00:03:03.550> the

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.670 
and named chin over in order to do the

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:06.930 
and named chin over in order to do the
second<00:03:03.970> row<00:03:04.090> of<00:03:04.120> stitches<00:03:04.720> so<00:03:05.250> this<00:03:06.250> would<00:03:06.670> be

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:06.940 
second row of stitches so this would be

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:10.140 
second row of stitches so this would be
if<00:03:07.240> you<00:03:07.540> wish<00:03:07.840> the<00:03:08.380> right<00:03:08.590> or<00:03:08.830> wrong<00:03:09.040> side<00:03:09.430> but

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150 
if you wish the right or wrong side but

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:14.100 
if you wish the right or wrong side but
as<00:03:10.300> a<00:03:10.330> felled<00:03:10.660> seam<00:03:10.959> is<00:03:11.350> actually<00:03:12.420> sewn<00:03:13.420> this

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:14.110 
as a felled seam is actually sewn this

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:16.560 
as a felled seam is actually sewn this
is<00:03:14.260> you<00:03:14.470> result<00:03:15.070> you'll<00:03:15.310> see<00:03:15.550> and<00:03:15.820> on<00:03:16.300> the

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:16.570 
is you result you'll see and on the

is you result you'll see and on the
wrong<00:03:16.959> side<00:03:17.290> if<00:03:17.560> you<00:03:17.709> like<00:03:17.950> would<00:03:18.880> be<00:03:19.150> this<00:03:19.390> one

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:19.690 
wrong side if you like would be this one

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:24.570 
wrong side if you like would be this one
row<00:03:19.959> of<00:03:20.489> stitching<00:03:21.489> and<00:03:21.730> there's<00:03:21.910> the<00:03:22.090> seam<00:03:23.580> so

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:24.580 
row of stitching and there's the seam so

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:26.040 
row of stitching and there's the seam so
in<00:03:24.700> this<00:03:24.820> example<00:03:25.000> going<00:03:25.540> back<00:03:25.630> to<00:03:25.930> my

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:26.050 
in this example going back to my

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:30.030 
in this example going back to my
previous<00:03:26.290> and<00:03:26.800> what<00:03:27.220> I<00:03:27.250> did<00:03:27.840> this<00:03:28.840> is<00:03:29.140> the<00:03:29.500> both

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.040 
previous and what I did this is the both

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:32.850 
previous and what I did this is the both
of<00:03:30.070> them<00:03:30.370> of<00:03:30.550> the<00:03:30.880> flat<00:03:31.450> felled<00:03:31.660> seam<00:03:31.780> but<00:03:32.739> if

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:32.860 
of them of the flat felled seam but if

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:35.340 
of them of the flat felled seam but if
you<00:03:32.980> wanted<00:03:33.310> the<00:03:33.430> effect<00:03:33.790> of<00:03:34.000> a<00:03:34.270> double<00:03:34.660> stitch

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:35.350 
you wanted the effect of a double stitch

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:37.229 
you wanted the effect of a double stitch
line<00:03:35.650> on<00:03:35.920> the<00:03:36.340> right<00:03:36.610> side<00:03:36.880> of<00:03:37.000> the<00:03:37.060> garment

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:37.239 
line on the right side of the garment

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:40.260 
line on the right side of the garment
you'd<00:03:38.020> need<00:03:38.290> to<00:03:38.440> do<00:03:38.620> the<00:03:39.100> seam<00:03:39.820> home

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:40.270 
you'd need to do the seam home

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:42.810 
you'd need to do the seam home
application<00:03:40.570> on<00:03:41.260> this<00:03:41.860> side<00:03:42.250> which<00:03:42.580> is<00:03:42.730> the

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:42.820 
application on this side which is the

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:46.770 
application on this side which is the
right<00:03:43.000> side<00:03:43.739> if<00:03:44.739> you<00:03:44.860> want<00:03:45.010> yourself<00:03:45.850> seem<00:03:46.540> to

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:46.780 
right side if you want yourself seem to

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:51.660 
right side if you want yourself seem to
be<00:03:46.900> on<00:03:47.080> the<00:03:47.230> inside<00:03:47.850> like<00:03:48.850> so<00:03:50.400> so<00:03:51.400> that's<00:03:51.580> the

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:51.670 
be on the inside like so so that's the

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:55.770 
be on the inside like so so that's the
same<00:03:51.850> as<00:03:52.239> that<00:03:52.510> then<00:03:53.470> you<00:03:54.070> will<00:03:54.280> have<00:03:54.670> one<00:03:55.390> row

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:55.780 
same as that then you will have one row

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:57.720 
same as that then you will have one row
of<00:03:56.049> stitching<00:03:56.680> and<00:03:56.830> this<00:03:57.190> will<00:03:57.340> be<00:03:57.459> the<00:03:57.580> result

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:57.730 
of stitching and this will be the result
