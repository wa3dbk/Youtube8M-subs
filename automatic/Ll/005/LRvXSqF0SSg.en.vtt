00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:04.300
 cross 

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:09.960
 Welcome to the live 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.490
 Here I bring you another tutorial this time 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.170
 I bring a tutorial that many of 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.269
 you have asked me and good 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.090
 it's just a pretty tutorial 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:21.000
 simple how to change the rails of 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:23.970
 the train tracks position for a 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.950
 side or for another is worth so good I'll 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:29.250
 to make a short journey of life to 

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:31.800
 they may see and it's pretty good 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:34.350
 easy to see is hard to explain well 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.950
 how good you see I have put a way in 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.989
 the one we say is turned to one side and 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.550
 has the possibility of turning towards the other 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.710
 So, what I'm going to do is 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.769
 connect a small stone circuit 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.780
 red with a lever is worth the idea is so 

00:00:46.769 --> 00:00:51.480
 easy as the next when in that 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.670
 the current will change 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.239
 sense there you see how it changes from 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.579
 side to side 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.780
 the idea is quite simple as you 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.579
 I say we just have to connect 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.159
 any kind of stone circuit 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:04.260
 red to a rail that you can choose between 

00:01:02.159 --> 00:01:06.810
 between two rail connections there what 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.240
 you see and it's changing in agreement so 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.760
 well maybe here on a life journey 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:15.330
 so little you do not see it very well 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:18.660
 so I've done a little tour of 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.550
 rails so you can see it with a little 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:22.770
 more detail and how it would work with 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:24.630
 a wagon so good I'm going to 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.520
 teach what I have good was picking 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.310
 a little bit of this and here you have the 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.620
 small circuit is worth just like 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:34.380
 is placed would go towards the stone that 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:36.090
 we have there in the background but it depends on what 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.800
 that we have activated on that lever that 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.440
 there is there that points to the way I say 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:42.360
 which has two possibilities depending 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:44.250
 how is that circuit can go towards 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.930
 one side or the other, there you go 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.240
 check how the trolley goes to the 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:51.810
 other side if the circuit is off in 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.820
 this case and you will see how it will go 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.490
 to the other side if I activate the lever 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:59.460
 OK, so you see that as 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.140
 I'm activating the button and the path changes 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:04.200
 of sense of agreement so it's good 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:06.090
 it's a pretty simple tutorial like 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.429
 You see it's pretty easy to use and 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.410
 good brings great results because in 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.240
 the same way we can make several 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.310
 tours and good as many of 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:17.250
 you had asked me why I have 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.630
 brought is as I tell you quite simple 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.760
 I hope you saw it 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:21.990
 pretty easy in the tutorial if you 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.090
 there is some doubt you already know that you can 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:26.820
 leave me any kind of comment on 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.680
 the video so good I hope the 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:30.390
 tutorial you liked it simply 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.740
 share the video with your friends 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:34.050
 to be informed of this method of 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:35.820
 change the direction of the rails and good 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.470
 just like if you give it taste and 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:39.180
 for more you know if nothing soon 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.900
 we will see in more tutorials a greeting and 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.900
 see you later
