00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
of this is like that but this in the

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.270 
of this is like that but this in the
back<00:01:36.470> it's<00:01:37.470> like<00:01:37.710> those<00:01:38.030> tightly<00:01:39.030> coiled<00:01:40.280> BD

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
back it's like those tightly coiled BD

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.749 
back it's like those tightly coiled BD
bees<00:01:41.670> or<00:01:41.850> whatever<00:01:42.090> but<00:01:43.520> this<00:01:44.520> would<00:01:44.670> have

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
bees or whatever but this would have

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:45.830 
bees or whatever but this would have
looked<00:01:44.880> like<00:01:45.090> when<00:01:45.299> is<00:01:45.390> going<00:01:45.540> to<00:01:45.600> be<00:01:45.659> washed

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
looked like when is going to be washed

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.800 
looked like when is going to be washed
shrunk<00:01:46.740> and<00:01:48.530> it<00:01:49.530> looks<00:01:49.829> really<00:01:49.890> short<00:01:50.369> and

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810 
shrunk and it looks really short and

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:52.999 
shrunk and it looks really short and
this<00:01:51.810> is<00:01:51.869> one<00:01:52.110> of<00:01:52.140> the<00:01:52.259> reasons<00:01:52.560> why<00:01:52.680> I<00:01:52.710> get

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
this is one of the reasons why I get

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.249 
this is one of the reasons why I get
frustrated<00:01:53.420> one<00:01:54.420> of<00:01:54.540> my<00:01:54.630> frustrations<00:01:55.140> are

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
frustrated one of my frustrations are

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.050 
frustrated one of my frustrations are
being<00:01:55.470> natural<00:01:55.829> that<00:01:56.040> you<00:01:56.430> really<00:01:56.880> feel<00:01:57.030> like

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
being natural that you really feel like

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.639 
being natural that you really feel like
you're<00:01:57.270> having<00:01:57.570> grown<00:01:57.780> because<00:01:58.229> it<00:01:58.530> is

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
you're having grown because it is

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:02.600 
you're having grown because it is
because<00:01:58.860> it<00:01:59.100> shrinks<00:02:00.000> so<00:02:00.119> much<00:02:00.329> but<00:02:01.340> like<00:02:02.340> this

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
because it shrinks so much but like this

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:07.210 
because it shrinks so much but like this
this<00:02:02.850> is<00:02:02.909> 13<00:02:03.479> months<00:02:03.899> and<00:02:04.110> in<00:02:04.920> the<00:02:05.790> back

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:07.220 
this is 13 months and in the back

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:09.340 
this is 13 months and in the back
stretch

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:09.350 
stretch

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:14.840 
stretch
it's<00:02:10.350> really<00:02:11.000> this<00:02:12.000> long<00:02:12.770> 13<00:02:13.770> months<00:02:14.100> this

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:14.850 
it's really this long 13 months this

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:22.850 
it's really this long 13 months this
long<00:02:15.090> all<00:02:15.360> natural<00:02:15.780> and<00:02:20.930> well<00:02:21.930> besides<00:02:22.440> I

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
long all natural and well besides I

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:35.200 
long all natural and well besides I
guess<00:02:23.100> this<00:02:23.970> is<00:02:24.180> like<00:02:24.330> backwards<00:02:25.760> besides

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:35.210 

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:41.030 

there<00:02:36.210> you<00:02:36.270> go<00:02:36.360> besides<00:02:37.170> our<00:02:37.650> this<00:02:37.980> long<00:02:39.890> and<00:02:40.890> I

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
there you go besides our this long and I

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.220 
there you go besides our this long and I
wish<00:02:41.220> my<00:02:41.370> heavy<00:02:41.550> just<00:02:41.760> stayed<00:02:42.000> this<00:02:42.720> long<00:02:42.780> and

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
wish my heavy just stayed this long and

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.230 
wish my heavy just stayed this long and
that<00:02:43.440> stretch<00:02:43.800> I<00:02:44.130> mean<00:02:44.400> shrink<00:02:44.670> back<00:02:44.880> into

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:45.240 
that stretch I mean shrink back into

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:49.780 
that stretch I mean shrink back into
