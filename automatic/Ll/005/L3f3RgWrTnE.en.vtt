00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.000 

the<00:00:00.390> fact<00:00:00.659> is<00:00:00.870> you<00:00:01.079> have<00:00:01.260> a<00:00:01.290> different<00:00:01.740> view<00:00:01.949> of

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:02.010 
the fact is you have a different view of

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:04.880 
the fact is you have a different view of
preservation<00:00:02.580> than<00:00:03.030> I<00:00:03.120> do<00:00:03.620> that's<00:00:04.620> the<00:00:04.710> same

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:04.890 
preservation than I do that's the same

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:13.430 
preservation than I do that's the same
thing<00:00:10.700> I<00:00:11.700> I<00:00:12.030> think<00:00:12.480> all<00:00:12.630> of<00:00:12.660> these<00:00:12.870> proof<00:00:13.110> texts

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
thing I I think all of these proof texts

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:14.629 
thing I I think all of these proof texts
are<00:00:13.530> used<00:00:13.740> for<00:00:13.950> the<00:00:14.219> doctrine<00:00:14.580> of

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
are used for the doctrine of

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.150 
are used for the doctrine of
preservation<00:00:14.880> do<00:00:15.809> not<00:00:16.020> even<00:00:16.260> talk<00:00:16.560> about<00:00:16.619> the

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
preservation do not even talk about the

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.769 
preservation do not even talk about the
preservation<00:00:17.369> of<00:00:17.760> the<00:00:17.850> text<00:00:18.180> what<00:00:18.660> we're

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
preservation of the text what we're

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:20.630 
preservation of the text what we're
dealing<00:00:18.869> with<00:00:19.050> here<00:00:19.380> is<00:00:19.560> the<00:00:19.920> preservation<00:00:20.550> in

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
dealing with here is the preservation in

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.509 
dealing with here is the preservation in
terms<00:00:20.880> of<00:00:21.150> the<00:00:21.570> words<00:00:21.840> are<00:00:22.170> either<00:00:22.740> prophetic

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
terms of the words are either prophetic

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.220 
terms of the words are either prophetic
that<00:00:23.850> is<00:00:24.000> these<00:00:24.300> words<00:00:24.570> will<00:00:24.720> not<00:00:24.840> pass<00:00:25.050> away

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
that is these words will not pass away

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:26.450 
that is these words will not pass away
heaven<00:00:25.529> on<00:00:25.590> earth<00:00:25.680> will<00:00:25.890> pass<00:00:26.010> away<00:00:26.070> but<00:00:26.279> my

heaven on earth will pass away but my

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.580 
heaven on earth will pass away but my

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
words will not pass away Jesus says in

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.230 
words will not pass away Jesus says in
Matthew<00:00:28.619> 23<00:00:29.189> that's<00:00:29.699> gonna<00:00:29.910> be<00:00:30.090> his

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
Matthew 23 that's gonna be his

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.359 
Matthew 23 that's gonna be his
prophecies<00:00:30.810> now<00:00:31.439> if<00:00:31.590> you<00:00:31.710> want<00:00:31.890> to<00:00:31.949> argue<00:00:32.099> that

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
prophecies now if you want to argue that

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:33.950 
prophecies now if you want to argue that
that<00:00:32.520> means<00:00:32.790> those<00:00:33.090> words<00:00:33.450> are<00:00:33.630> actually

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
that means those words are actually

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.870 
that means those words are actually
preserved<00:00:34.290> somewhere<00:00:34.649> in<00:00:34.739> the<00:00:34.829> Bible<00:00:35.010> and<00:00:35.399> why

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
preserved somewhere in the Bible and why

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.299 
preserved somewhere in the Bible and why
is<00:00:35.940> it<00:00:36.120> that<00:00:36.360> in<00:00:36.480> John<00:00:36.690> 21<00:00:37.079> he<00:00:37.350> says<00:00:37.380> everything

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
is it that in John 21 he says everything

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:39.740 
is it that in John 21 he says everything
that<00:00:38.460> Jesus<00:00:38.610> didn't<00:00:39.030> said<00:00:39.210> the<00:00:39.600> whole

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
that Jesus didn't said the whole

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.560 
that Jesus didn't said the whole
libraries<00:00:40.260> of<00:00:40.440> the<00:00:40.469> world<00:00:40.559> could<00:00:40.950> not<00:00:41.070> contain

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:41.570 
libraries of the world could not contain

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:43.670 
libraries of the world could not contain
obviously<00:00:42.570> not<00:00:42.750> all<00:00:42.899> the<00:00:42.989> words<00:00:43.170> of<00:00:43.320> Jesus<00:00:43.590> are

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
obviously not all the words of Jesus are

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.380 
obviously not all the words of Jesus are
written<00:00:43.950> down<00:00:44.070> so<00:00:44.820> what<00:00:44.969> happened<00:00:45.270> to<00:00:45.329> the

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
written down so what happened to the

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:46.850 
written down so what happened to the
preservation<00:00:45.600> of<00:00:45.989> those<00:00:46.140> words<00:00:46.320> it<00:00:46.649> doesn't

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
preservation of those words it doesn't

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.470 
preservation of those words it doesn't
mean<00:00:47.129> that<00:00:47.340> it<00:00:47.969> means<00:00:48.120> something<00:00:48.450> different

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
mean that it means something different

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.450 
mean that it means something different
it<00:00:48.750> means<00:00:48.840> prophecy<00:00:49.469> your<00:00:50.039> doctor<00:00:50.370> and

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
it means prophecy your doctor and

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.400 
it means prophecy your doctor and
preservation<00:00:51.030> is<00:00:51.120> based<00:00:51.360> on<00:00:51.870> a<00:00:51.930> faulty

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
preservation is based on a faulty

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.400 
preservation is based on a faulty
exegesis<00:00:53.039> of<00:00:53.340> a<00:00:53.520> handful<00:00:54.420> of<00:00:54.449> passages<00:00:55.020> that

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
exegesis of a handful of passages that

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.350 
exegesis of a handful of passages that
you<00:00:55.559> extrapolate<00:00:55.949> and<00:00:56.250> then<00:00:56.399> you<00:00:56.550> say<00:00:57.059> this

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
you extrapolate and then you say this

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:58.939 
you extrapolate and then you say this
refers<00:00:57.719> just<00:00:58.020> to<00:00:58.109> the<00:00:58.199> King<00:00:58.379> James<00:00:58.559> without

00:06:57.060 --> 00:06:57.070 
don't we have it today I mean that would

00:06:57.070 --> 00:06:58.530 
don't we have it today I mean that would
be<00:06:57.100> great<00:06:57.190> proof<00:06:57.820> right<00:06:58.090> there

00:06:58.530 --> 00:06:58.540 
be great proof right there

00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:01.050 
be great proof right there
he<00:06:59.020> didn't<00:06:59.440> worse<00:06:59.830> he<00:07:00.070> didn't<00:07:00.460> okay<00:07:00.850> why

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:01.060 
he didn't worse he didn't okay why

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:02.220 
he didn't worse he didn't okay why
because<00:07:01.510> what<00:07:01.660> did<00:07:01.750> they<00:07:01.840> do<00:07:01.900> in<00:07:01.990> the<00:07:02.110> Old

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:02.230 
because what did they do in the Old

00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:03.420 
because what did they do in the Old
Testament<00:07:02.650> they<00:07:02.770> would<00:07:02.919> rather<00:07:03.100> they

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:03.430 
Testament they would rather they

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:05.129 
Testament they would rather they
overshadow<00:07:03.970> worship<00:07:04.300> it<00:07:04.450> now<00:07:04.630> I<00:07:04.660> think<00:07:04.810> that

00:07:05.129 --> 00:07:05.139 
overshadow worship it now I think that

00:07:05.139 --> 00:07:06.810 
overshadow worship it now I think that
that's<00:07:05.320> a<00:07:05.440> pretty<00:07:05.620> strong<00:07:05.919> argument<00:07:06.430> for<00:07:06.460> not

00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:06.820 
that's a pretty strong argument for not

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:09.570 
that's a pretty strong argument for not
having<00:07:07.270> these<00:07:07.900> originals<00:07:08.710> in<00:07:09.040> somebody's

00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:09.580 
having these originals in somebody's

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:11.280 
having these originals in somebody's
hands<00:07:10.090> because<00:07:10.480> we<00:07:10.510> could<00:07:10.750> either<00:07:10.810> worship

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:11.290 
hands because we could either worship

00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:15.210 
hands because we could either worship
them<00:07:11.470> or<00:07:11.680> somebody<00:07:12.010> could<00:07:12.520> distort<00:07:12.940> though
