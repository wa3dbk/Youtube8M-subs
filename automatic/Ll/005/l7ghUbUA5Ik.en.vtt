unit came with Pro Tools se which I'm

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.880 
unit came with Pro Tools se which I'm
not<00:01:33.390> a<00:01:33.450> huge<00:01:33.659> fan<00:01:33.689> of<00:01:33.930> I<00:01:34.290> mean<00:01:34.470> it's<00:01:34.650> they're

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
not a huge fan of I mean it's they're

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.649 
not a huge fan of I mean it's they're
very<00:01:35.759> stripped-down<00:01:36.560> version<00:01:37.560> of<00:01:37.680> Pro<00:01:37.979> Tools

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:41.120 
very stripped-down version of Pro Tools
which<00:01:39.659> is<00:01:39.810> ridiculous<00:01:40.470> I<00:01:40.619> mean<00:01:40.650> you<00:01:40.860> can't

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
which is ridiculous I mean you can't

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.300 
which is ridiculous I mean you can't
even<00:01:41.960> you<00:01:42.960> can't<00:01:43.020> even<00:01:43.259> manipulate<00:01:43.619> anything

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
even you can't even manipulate anything

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.010 
even you can't even manipulate anything
it's<00:01:44.490> just<00:01:44.700> so<00:01:44.850> stripped<00:01:45.270> down<00:01:45.360> I<00:01:45.600> don't<00:01:45.930> even

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
it's just so stripped down I don't even

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.679 
it's just so stripped down I don't even
know<00:01:46.200> why<00:01:46.350> they<00:01:46.380> include<00:01:46.860> it<00:01:47.009> but<00:01:47.189> they<00:01:47.399> did

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:47.689 
know why they include it but they did

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:50.210 
know why they include it but they did
but<00:01:48.689> what<00:01:49.200> I<00:01:49.229> you<00:01:49.350> know<00:01:49.590> what<00:01:49.770> I<00:01:49.799> normally<00:01:50.189> use

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
but what I you know what I normally use

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.389 
but what I you know what I normally use
is<00:01:50.610> I<00:01:50.759> use<00:01:50.939> on<00:01:51.210> cakewalk<00:01:51.810> Pro<00:01:52.200> Audio<00:01:52.409> I'm

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
old-school like that I'm just so used to

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.840 
old-school like that I'm just so used to
this<00:01:57.990> software<00:01:58.710> I've<00:01:59.100> been<00:01:59.280> using<00:01:59.490> if<00:01:59.700> all

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
this software I've been using if all

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.359 
this software I've been using if all
along<00:02:00.000> time<00:02:00.270> and<00:02:00.600> it<00:02:01.409> does<00:02:01.619> what<00:02:01.799> I<00:02:01.829> needed<00:02:02.280> to

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
along time and it does what I needed to

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:05.690 
along time and it does what I needed to
do<00:02:02.549> so<00:02:03.619> so<00:02:04.619> that's<00:02:05.070> what<00:02:05.250> I'm<00:02:05.340> doing<00:02:05.610> I'm

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
do so so that's what I'm doing I'm

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.670 
do so so that's what I'm doing I'm
fooling<00:02:06.360> around<00:02:06.570> with<00:02:06.659> this<00:02:06.780> it's<00:02:07.079> pretty

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
fooling around with this it's pretty

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.559 
fooling around with this it's pretty
basic<00:02:07.860> you<00:02:08.340> know<00:02:08.459> it's<00:02:08.640> a<00:02:08.700> basic<00:02:09.030> set<00:02:09.209> up<00:02:09.330> it's

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
basic you know it's a basic set up it's

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.720 
basic you know it's a basic set up it's
just<00:02:09.690> a<00:02:09.899> stripped<00:02:10.379> down<00:02:10.440> version<00:02:10.560> of

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
just a stripped down version of

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.430 
just a stripped down version of
version<00:02:11.909> of<00:02:12.000> getting<00:02:12.180> audio<00:02:12.659> into<00:02:12.959> your<00:02:13.080> PC

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440

00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:16.379 
and recording it there's nothing too

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:19.850 
and recording it there's nothing too
fancy<00:02:16.560> about<00:02:16.890> it<00:02:17.099> I<00:02:17.400> think<00:02:17.849> I<00:02:18.060> paid<00:02:18.299> like<00:02:18.860> $89

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
fancy about it I think I paid like $89

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.920 
fancy about it I think I paid like $89
for<00:02:20.099> this<00:02:20.220> unit<00:02:20.549> it<00:02:20.640> came<00:02:20.819> this<00:02:21.540> is<00:02:21.569> a<00:02:21.720> box

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930

it<00:06:16.540> works<00:06:16.810> just<00:06:17.140> fine<00:06:17.410> but<00:06:17.910> there<00:06:18.910> you<00:06:19.030> go

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:19.450 
it works just fine but there you go

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:25.230 
it works just fine but there you go
is<00:06:19.660> the<00:06:19.930> m-audio<00:06:21.180> and<00:06:22.180> there's<00:06:22.780> a<00:06:22.900> box<00:06:24.240> and

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:25.240 
is the m-audio and there's a box and

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:30.690 
is the m-audio and there's a box and
more<00:06:25.450> do<00:06:25.630> and<00:06:26.530> there's<00:06:26.800> the<00:06:26.919> box<00:06:27.419> have<00:06:28.419> fun
