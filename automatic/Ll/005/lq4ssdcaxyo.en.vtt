really<00:06:25.110> hard<00:06:25.380> for<00:06:25.440> you<00:06:25.590> to<00:06:25.680> actually<00:06:25.770> sit

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:26.070 
really hard for you to actually sit

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:28.340 
really hard for you to actually sit
there<00:06:26.220> and<00:06:26.310> try<00:06:26.520> to<00:06:26.640> recreate<00:06:27.090> so<00:06:27.540> i<00:06:27.780> would<00:06:28.230> say

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:28.350 
there and try to recreate so i would say

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:31.640 
there and try to recreate so i would say
use<00:06:28.560> your<00:06:28.770> palette<00:06:29.100> of<00:06:29.160> purples<00:06:29.640> and<00:06:30.440> just<00:06:31.440> do

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:31.650 
use your palette of purples and just do

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:34.310 
use your palette of purples and just do
your<00:06:31.740> thing<00:06:31.970> it's<00:06:32.970> probably<00:06:33.810> more<00:06:34.080> likely

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:34.320 
your thing it's probably more likely

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:36.530 
your thing it's probably more likely
that<00:06:34.470> you'll<00:06:34.770> be<00:06:35.040> recreating<00:06:35.760> the<00:06:36.120> harriet

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:36.540 
that you'll be recreating the harriet

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:38.870 
that you'll be recreating the harriet
side<00:06:36.930> rather<00:06:37.260> than<00:06:37.380> this<00:06:37.710> side<00:06:37.950> so<00:06:38.670> i<00:06:38.700> hope

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:38.880 
side rather than this side so i hope

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:49.740 
side rather than this side so i hope
used<00:06:39.090> to<00:06:39.210> like<00:06:39.390> that<00:06:39.570> anyway

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:49.750 

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:52.670
