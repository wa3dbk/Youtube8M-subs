00:00:13.913 --> 00:00:16.242
 Yo! 

00:00:16.751 --> 00:00:19.368
 Forgive me, but I was just dealing with the opposition's affairs. 

00:00:20.226 --> 00:00:23.410
 I see you are a bit moody in front of a classic, huh? 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:27.110
 Well, I will let you film from the period when I was in power, break up a bit, hen! 

00:00:27.885 --> 00:00:29.078
 This video is about Ronaldinho. 

00:00:29.078 --> 00:00:30.452
 Who signed the contract with him? 

00:00:32.142 --> 00:00:33.406
 My awesome. 

00:00:33.696 --> 00:00:37.671
 Ok, Sandro was sort of out there, he flew around the airports ... 

00:00:37.671 --> 00:00:39.831
 Well, but sorra, who was the president? 

00:00:40.458 --> 00:00:41.532
 My awesome. 

00:00:41.762 --> 00:00:43.128
 And I never had to resign! 

00:00:43.128 --> 00:00:44.251
 Al loro. 

00:00:45.425 --> 00:00:47.107
 At Bernabé you have to go with your head raised. 

00:00:47.107 --> 00:00:49.350
 And who is a cyclist, a trip from the ship! 

00:00:49.847 --> 00:00:51.081
 As Alves said. 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:53.427
 A nice guy ... 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.495
 "Can you repeat, I did not hear?" 

00:00:57.897 --> 00:00:59.467
 It's a decent culé! 

00:00:59.956 --> 00:01:03.116
 Who signed the contract with him? 

00:01:03.398 --> 00:01:04.639
 My awesome. 

00:01:06.106 --> 00:01:08.906
 I am a crack. I know. 

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:11.378
 Give me a movie here! 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.826
 The story of Barça according to Crackòvia 

00:01:17.238 --> 00:01:20.121
 Mustaches are invariably present in Barça's history: 

00:01:20.121 --> 00:01:21.018
 this Joana Gamper, 

00:01:21.018 --> 00:01:22.510
 this guy from Mourinho's finger in his eye, 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:24.715
 or the niece Huga Sotila. 

00:01:25.226 --> 00:01:27.583
 But the most famous mustache belongs to this man, 

00:01:27.583 --> 00:01:30.193
 who applauds Barça winning at Bernabéu 3: 0. 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.373
 Today, a few days before El Clásico, it's hard to believe that it really took place. 

00:01:34.373 --> 00:01:35.807
 How did this happen? 

00:01:37.277 --> 00:01:40.480
 Ronaldinho on the ball, phenomenally defeats Ramos! 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:45.170
 The last of the defenders passes 

00:01:45.851 --> 00:01:48.870
 Hypnotizes Casillas and goool! 

00:01:52.963 --> 00:01:54.490
 Man, why did you leave me alone? 

00:01:55.153 --> 00:01:57.110
 What are you doing in La Liga? 

00:01:57.113 --> 00:01:58.470
 Where is Diego López? 

00:01:59.437 --> 00:02:02.310
 Gutiérrez? And where did you come from? 

00:02:02.816 --> 00:02:05.030
 Did you get a new contract? 

00:02:05.379 --> 00:02:06.660
 And why do you have long hair? 

00:02:06.664 --> 00:02:08.280
 I do not like it. 

00:02:09.622 --> 00:02:11.480
 And why do I have long hair? 

00:02:11.485 --> 00:02:14.050
 My dear, it's called Flashback. 

00:02:14.571 --> 00:02:16.590
 Are you saying that all this is not really happening? 

00:02:17.453 --> 00:02:20.707
 We play badly, we are trained by Vanderley Luxemburgo, 

00:02:20.707 --> 00:02:24.710
 Salgado plays on the side of defense, and Ronaldo is already this thick version. 

00:02:25.306 --> 00:02:28.500
 Forgive me, but I will shoot the second goal. 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.050
 But I am asking you so much, do not be embarrassed! 

00:02:31.516 --> 00:02:34.900
 Ronaldinho passes the defense line and goool !!! 

00:02:37.648 --> 00:02:40.380
 This event is more unusual than the Mascherano goal. 

00:02:40.792 --> 00:02:42.580
 See how Bernabéu applauds Barça. 

00:02:44.624 --> 00:02:46.219
 What are we doing? 

00:02:46.219 --> 00:02:47.837
 The whole world will see it. 

00:02:47.837 --> 00:02:52.880
 There are thousands of people here, we are not so unlucky that the camera hit us. 

00:02:53.782 --> 00:02:55.990
 This is how two things have been proven: 

00:02:55.992 --> 00:02:58.946
 A: If you have a mustache, you attract attention, 

00:02:58.946 --> 00:03:02.700
 B: Since this story has happened once, it can be repeated in the upcoming match. 

00:03:04.105 --> 00:03:06.070
 She has already repeated for Guardiola with a score of 2: 6. 

00:03:06.073 --> 00:03:07.140
 Well, again. 

00:03:07.144 --> 00:03:09.430
 And the match ended with 1: 3 result with Abidal's goal? 

00:03:10.194 --> 00:03:13.310
 Either way, it is certain that history repeats itself, does not it? 

00:03:14.991 --> 00:03:17.510
 Hey, if you win this time, I will not applaud you. 

00:03:17.513 --> 00:03:19.610
 So that no one would recognize me with these mustaches, I had to live in Chueca [1]. 

00:03:26.907 --> 00:03:28.300
 Mustached. 

00:03:29.059 --> 00:03:30.490
 And who rented it? 

00:03:31.888 --> 00:03:32.950
 My awesome. 

00:03:33.716 --> 00:03:37.810
 And his son, now slightly disappointed with life? 

00:03:39.072 --> 00:03:40.200
 My awesome. 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:42.640
 I am a crack. 

00:03:45.483 --> 00:03:47.790
 Ah, it's hard life ...
