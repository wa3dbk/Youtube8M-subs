training barley for prostitutes that's
how<00:00:54.960> valuable<00:00:54.989> it<00:00:55.800> was<00:01:09.409> the<00:01:10.409> point<00:01:10.770> is<00:01:11.159> that

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
how valuable it was the point is that

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.609 
how valuable it was the point is that
this<00:01:12.750> of<00:01:13.229> this<00:01:13.439> cheap<00:01:14.400> grain<00:01:15.619> omnivore

this of this cheap grain omnivore

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:21.140 
this of this cheap grain omnivore
consumption<00:01:17.580> is<00:01:17.820> an<00:01:18.450> extreme<00:01:20.150> historical

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150

that's the point and now that's not to

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:29.870 
that's the point and now that's not to
say<00:01:28.229> that<00:01:28.409> we<00:01:28.530> can't<00:01:28.799> do<00:01:28.979> some<00:01:29.189> really<00:01:29.520> cool

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
say that we can't do some really cool

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
those electrified nettings so that we

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.469 
those electrified nettings so that we

we<00:01:52.350> can<00:01:52.500> protect<00:01:52.860> them<00:01:53.070> from<00:01:53.250> predation

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
we can protect them from predation

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.639 
we can protect them from predation
I'm<00:01:54.119> not<00:01:54.360> saying<00:01:54.659> that<00:01:54.750> we<00:01:54.930> you<00:01:55.140> know<00:01:55.170> we<00:01:55.380> can't

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
I'm not saying that we you know we can't

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.789 
I'm not saying that we you know we can't
do<00:01:55.890> better<00:01:56.240> but<00:01:57.240> in<00:01:57.390> the<00:01:57.930> big<00:01:58.140> picture<00:01:58.649> you

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
do better but in the big picture you

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.340 
do better but in the big picture you
know<00:01:58.950> that<00:01:58.979> would<00:01:59.460> be<00:01:59.640> eating<00:02:00.360> the<00:02:00.750> closest<00:02:01.200> to

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
know that would be eating the closest to

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.679 
know that would be eating the closest to
nature<00:02:01.500> all<00:02:01.860> right<00:02:02.040> so<00:02:03.030> here<00:02:03.210> we<00:02:03.240> are<00:02:03.329> at<00:02:03.570> the

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
nature all right so here we are at the

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.830 
nature all right so here we are at the
broilers<00:02:04.140> or<00:02:04.380> they<00:02:04.890> get<00:02:05.130> again<00:02:05.490> a<00:02:05.729> local<00:02:06.360> GMO

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
broilers or they get again a local GMO

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.540 
broilers or they get again a local GMO
free<00:02:08.030> grain<00:02:09.030> diet<00:02:09.509> and<00:02:10.289> we<00:02:10.500> move<00:02:10.800> them<00:02:11.160> every

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
free grain diet and we move them every

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:12.570 
free grain diet and we move them every
day<00:02:11.580> to

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
day to

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.560 
day to
a fresh<00:02:12.970> spot<00:02:13.930> that<00:02:14.560> they<00:02:14.710> haven't<00:02:15.070> been<00:02:15.220> on

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.570 
a fresh spot that they haven't been on

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:20.570 
a fresh spot that they haven't been on
and<00:02:16.570> so<00:02:16.960> the<00:02:17.590> chickens<00:02:18.040> are<00:02:18.160> only<00:02:18.340> on<00:02:18.610> one<00:02:19.150> spot

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
and so the chickens are only on one spot

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:26.250 
and so the chickens are only on one spot
one<00:02:21.580> day<00:02:21.970> a<00:02:22.420> year<00:02:24.510> there's<00:02:25.510> a<00:02:25.600> whole<00:02:25.810> year's

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
one day a year there's a whole year's

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.760 
one day a year there's a whole year's
rest<00:02:26.650> before<00:02:27.280> we<00:02:27.490> come<00:02:27.760> back<00:02:27.790> to<00:02:28.150> that<00:02:28.180> spot

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770 
rest before we come back to that spot

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:32.100 
rest before we come back to that spot
that<00:02:29.770> breaks<00:02:30.160> up<00:02:30.400> the<00:02:30.430> pathogen<00:02:31.090> cycles<00:02:31.600> it

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
that breaks up the pathogen cycles it

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.940 
that breaks up the pathogen cycles it
spreads<00:02:32.680> the<00:02:32.890> manure<00:02:33.190> onto<00:02:33.670> more<00:02:33.880> ground<00:02:34.240> and

so<00:03:06.970> so<00:03:07.600> you<00:03:08.110> know<00:03:08.490> we<00:03:09.490> so<00:03:09.820> we<00:03:10.060> know<00:03:10.300> that<00:03:10.780> we're

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930 
so so you know we so we know that we're

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:14.400 
so so you know we so we know that we're
putting<00:03:11.320> on<00:03:11.500> all<00:03:12.160> the<00:03:12.640> nutrient<00:03:13.180> that<00:03:14.170> the

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:14.410 
putting on all the nutrient that the

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:17.490 
putting on all the nutrient that the
soil<00:03:14.740> can<00:03:14.980> metabolize<00:03:15.430> in<00:03:16.090> one<00:03:16.660> pass<00:03:16.989> of<00:03:17.320> these

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.500 
soil can metabolize in one pass of these

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.040 
soil can metabolize in one pass of these
broilers<00:03:18.040> that's<00:03:18.580> why<00:03:18.760> we<00:03:18.940> don't<00:03:19.060> come<00:03:19.810> back

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:20.050 
broilers that's why we don't come back

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:23.160
