00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
without steering it would get to the

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.380 
without steering it would get to the
corner<00:02:00.509> I<00:02:00.630> would<00:02:00.780> stop<00:02:01.140> and<00:02:01.409> it<00:02:01.469> would<00:02:01.560> go<00:02:02.390> no

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
should I do now so once it wasn't making

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.779 
should I do now so once it wasn't making
decisions<00:02:07.140> like<00:02:07.200> that<00:02:07.290> at<00:02:07.530> the<00:02:07.619> walk<00:02:07.829> then<00:02:08.610> we

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
decisions like that at the walk then we

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.609 
decisions like that at the walk then we
did<00:02:08.910> at<00:02:09.030> the<00:02:09.119> truck<00:02:09.360> and<00:02:10.050> so<00:02:10.229> she<00:02:10.289> trotted

00:02:51.059 --> 00:02:51.069 
life and I said well that's probably the

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:52.559 
life and I said well that's probably the
first<00:02:51.099> time<00:02:51.609> your<00:02:51.819> horse<00:02:52.030> has<00:02:52.120> actually<00:02:52.450> been

00:02:52.559 --> 00:02:52.569 
first time your horse has actually been

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:54.599
