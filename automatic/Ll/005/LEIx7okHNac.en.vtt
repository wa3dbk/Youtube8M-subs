00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.760
 today will tell you how to add 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:04.760
 Photoshop sharpness 

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:16.130
 Tara welcome to about photoshop today 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:20.060
 tell you how to add sharpness 

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:22.730
 Photoshop will show two methods one more 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:25.210
 barbaric with the standard 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:27.230
 Photoshop filter and one more 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:28.460
 professional and popular method for 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:35.050
 high pass filter help 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:38.059
 and so let's see we have a portrait 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:39.170
 let's make 

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:41.480
 image of things 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:44.230
 first of all we duplicate the layer when 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:47.329
 control jay key combination 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:49.399
 made a duplicate now the first way 

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:51.500
 This is with the help of Sandr from the standard 

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:57.010
 Photoshop filters for this need 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:01:00.070
 go to the tab filter sharp and 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:03.469
 anger search 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:07.700
 Now, such a filter have here a number of 

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:13.010
 add sharpness radius and treshhold 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:18.470
 this is a filter that takes away 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:23.200
 the amount of that effect let's say as i 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:23.200
 I understand it in unnecessary areas that is 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:33.160
 by unnecessary zones I mean there 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:36.710
 where but those parts of the photo on which 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:38.450
 less contrast ie this filter 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:40.640
 working chock principle what it finds 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:43.100
 contours ie for example contours there 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:46.780
 hairs in the eye of this lobe and makes 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:49.220
 it is their things but when we apply 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:52.160
 a large amount of this effect then 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:53.990
 affected and the skin texture of the hair and in 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:59.420
 principle the texture of these photos even in 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:02:01.850
 shadows noise becomes speech therefore there is 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:04.040
 such a filter 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:07.110
 in order for example in the shadows 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:09.060
 fewer details added namely 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:13.430
 added more details where needed 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:17.400
 that is, the contour of the eye and other details 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:24.690
 that's the way in this case we 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:29.910
 can add about one hundred percent with 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:32.630
 333 school radius 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.630
 four 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:43.290
 basically a normal result but you can 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:47.040
 do better then there is a second method more 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:49.440
 sophisticated more progressive but takes 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.660
 a little more time but he addition 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:54.150
 worth it and let's consider now the second 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:57.920
 method using filters and dog for 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:03:02.180
 This will duplicate the layer again. 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:04.640
 go to the tab filter other high 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:08.340
 pass 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:11.750
 ok we get such a sulfur image and 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.750
 when we add 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:19.320
 radius then we see that everything appears 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:21.930
 more and more contour contour 

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:25.730
 such is too much 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:29.720
 we need a softer result something 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:32.720
 can switch with vein eye and 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:32.720
 watch 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:43.989
 approximately in my case radius is 3 pixels 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:47.110
 suits me okay now-a-translate 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:56.170
 this layer is in overlay mode 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:59.510
 hardlight and let's see see what 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:02.269
 got a good result but we see 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:05.450
 that and also adds sharpness and shadows 

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:09.250
 and in principle can be made softer 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:12.760
 result using this method 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:15.140
 let's go back to the background layer 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:18.790
 go to select tab or 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:21.470
 selection color range 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:25.460
 with this tool we can 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:27.410
 highlight our principle this tool 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:33.740
 highlights exactly the color but we can 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:35.660
 highlight our names color though you may 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:38.560
 kill highlight and color can highlight 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:40.550
 shadows separately separately light areas 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:42.770
 our case we need to highlight exactly 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:47.200
 the light in the area that is, we click on 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:50.849
 our skinton can choose 

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:53.909
 amount of selection 

00:04:50.849 --> 00:04:56.729
 and range with the help earlier we do here 

00:04:53.909 --> 00:05:01.830
 vignetting to separate 

00:04:56.729 --> 00:05:04.770
 It is the background plot that is already 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:08.089
 all we see is black will not 

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:13.259
 highlighted and all that white will be highlighted 

00:05:08.089 --> 00:05:16.169
 ok we need to have a gradation from 

00:05:13.259 --> 00:05:19.830
 white to black that is if a lot 

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:22.830
 gray is basically okay okay 

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:27.679
 choose this now go to 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:31.229
 h-ips layer and create a mask 

00:05:27.679 --> 00:05:35.339
 Now we see that our filter 

00:05:31.229 --> 00:05:39.689
 less applied in shadows and more 

00:05:35.339 --> 00:05:44.059
 It is used in bright areas 

00:05:39.689 --> 00:05:44.059
 there is a visible eye bromine eyebrow well 

00:05:44.179 --> 00:05:55.129
 it was by eye and eyebrow that lay down well 

00:05:47.429 --> 00:05:57.689
 the effect now we can do so 

00:05:55.129 --> 00:06:00.990
 effect for changed only on face 

00:05:57.689 --> 00:06:05.490
 for example, well, or in those areas that 

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:06.300
 we need to create a group here 

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:08.610
 this daddy 

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:10.729
 or exit only layer, press control 

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:10.729
 jay 

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:20.800
 now we make a mask on the group itself 

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:23.860
 fill it with black and using 

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:25.630
 brushes white draw only those 

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:28.330
 sections of the photo on which we want 

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:30.160
 add sharpness ie in this 

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:32.830
 If I want to add sharpness 

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:37.800
 on the face and leave the rest to the rest 

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:37.800
 the rest of the rest of the photos 

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:48.350
 if the effect is too small for you 

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:50.230
 whether you repeat this operation or just 

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:55.880
 duplicate layer 

00:06:50.230 --> 00:07:00.230
 but do not look here and apply and yet 

00:06:55.880 --> 00:07:03.980
 more sharpness hope it was you 

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:08.290
