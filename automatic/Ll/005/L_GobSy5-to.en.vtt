00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:04.510
 Y 

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:08.370
 all right 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.020
 hello that such friends as are I am oscar 

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:18.240
 uriel welcome to the premieres of this 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.220
 week without any doubt the news of 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.619
 these days is that the company twenty 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.840
 century fox decided not to exhibit 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.810
 movie 'the fantastic 4' at 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:30.060
 media before the premiere 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.250
 of this movie that is undoubtedly one of 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.199
 my most anticipated titles of this 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.820
 season usually when it 

00:00:34.199 --> 00:00:38.820
 a situation happens with these 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:41.340
 characteristics is that the movie does not 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:44.580
 it was very good the reports tell us 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:46.409
 that it is a costly failure the 

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:48.870
 which was entrusted to the young director 

00:00:46.409 --> 00:00:50.940
 georges klein who some years ago 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.890
 we watched a film titled chronic in 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.799
 which we like very much however 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.629
 it seems that this movie was big 

00:00:55.799 --> 00:00:59.400
 We were recently in the comic-con 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.350
 we talked with the cast and they 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:04.739
 they defended the director at all times 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:07.280
 However, we are facing the failure of 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.280
 this summer 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.730
 mud landscapes 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:21.410
 from time to time friends we receive in the 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:23.150
 billboard a typical comedy which 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:25.610
 We appreciate it because almost all 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:28.130
 movies within this good genre 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:29.930
 they are very similar in this case we are 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.850
 talking about the movie the voices 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:34.010
 directed by the Iranian director 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:35.480
 marjane satrapi who makes some 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:38.330
 years we watched the great movie 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:40.700
 persÃ©polis after chicken with blums 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:43.070
 etc. Now we can say that with the 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:45.050
 voices dabbles in the middle 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:47.840
 Hollywood story focuses on 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:50.720
 this character played by ryan 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:53.900
 reynolds a man who engages in dialogues 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:55.910
 with your dog pets and a cat who 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:59.090
 in turn they offer you terrifying 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:02.720
 Tips for your love life 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:04.780
 the idea is dark bizarre we like but 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:07.070
 unfortunately, it does not work 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:09.080
 probably the highlight of this 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:11.930
 film is the participation of the 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:13.730
 British actress Gemma Arterton 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.720
 on our scale of 5 stars le 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:18.720

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.720

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:27.910
 no no 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:29.650

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:31.540
 for this weekend is the movie 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:34.330
 Eden directed by the French Mia 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:36.490
 hansen-love a portrait of music 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:38.980
 electronics of the nineties 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:41.800
 through its protagonists what is 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:43.870
 very interesting is I wanted to do it up 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:46.570
 history in one's own experiences 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:48.550
 from his brother a prominent dj who 

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:50.830
 Unfortunately he did not run with luck 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:53.410
 of that pair of young people who were his 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:56.190
 competition better known today 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:56.190
 comfortable 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:09.540
 hansen what gives us a story with 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:11.220
 a rather particular tempo with the 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:12.900
 purpose of involving the 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:15.510
 spectator in the adventures and 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:18.629
 misadventures of our central character 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:21.390
 a story that almost ends in a 

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:23.040
 tragedy but it will not be like that 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:24.660
 eren not only going to be enjoyed 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.209
