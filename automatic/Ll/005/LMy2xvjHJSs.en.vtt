hundred percent possible for rock
started<00:00:33.260> do<00:00:33.470> if<00:00:33.740> they<00:00:34.160> choose<00:00:34.490> to<00:00:34.550> do<00:00:34.970> it

pc so the limits aren't going to be an

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:38.620 
pc so the limits aren't going to be an
obstacle<00:01:37.070> the<00:01:37.490> way<00:01:37.610> they<00:01:37.730> were<00:01:37.790> but<00:01:38.150> before

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:38.630

wasn't<00:01:45.350> a<00:01:45.380> story<00:01:45.680> I<00:01:45.980> think<00:01:46.640> it's<00:01:46.760> time<00:01:46.940> for

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:47.180 
wasn't a story I think it's time for

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:48.370 
wasn't a story I think it's time for
them<00:01:47.270> to<00:01:47.300> finally<00:01:47.600> bring<00:01:47.870> something<00:01:48.230> like

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
them to finally bring something like

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:50.320 
them to finally bring something like
this<00:01:48.500> out<00:01:48.740> I<00:01:48.980> don't<00:01:49.400> expect<00:01:49.640> anything<00:01:49.970> like

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:50.330

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:52.870

would<00:02:50.990> work<00:02:51.200> too<00:02:51.260> you<00:02:52.130> know<00:02:52.250> something

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:52.880 
would work too you know something

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:56.410 
would work too you know something
humongous<00:02:53.840> I<00:02:54.380> think<00:02:54.680> would<00:02:54.770> really<00:02:55.000> keep<00:02:56.000> the

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420 
humongous I think would really keep the

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:59.140 
humongous I think would really keep the
fans<00:02:56.930> for<00:02:57.350> roxor<00:02:57.800> games<00:02:58.040> a<00:02:58.340> lot<00:02:58.700> more

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 
fans for roxor games a lot more

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.420 
fans for roxor games a lot more
interested<00:02:59.630> in<00:02:59.720> GTA<00:03:00.110> 5<00:03:00.410> and<00:03:00.650> considering<00:03:01.340> the

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430 
interested in GTA 5 and considering the

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:03.730 
interested in GTA 5 and considering the
fact<00:03:01.730> of<00:03:01.880> how<00:03:02.060> they<00:03:02.390> delayed<00:03:02.990> heist<00:03:03.290> I<00:03:03.500> think

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:03.740 
fact of how they delayed heist I think

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:05.170 
fact of how they delayed heist I think
it<00:03:03.860> would<00:03:03.950> be<00:03:03.980> something<00:03:04.250> that<00:03:04.400> would<00:03:04.580> really

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 
it would be something that would really

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:07.620 
it would be something that would really
be<00:03:05.660> beneficial<00:03:06.320> for<00:03:06.350> rockstar<00:03:06.920> and

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:07.630 
be beneficial for rockstar and

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:09.790 
be beneficial for rockstar and
considering<00:03:08.630> that<00:03:08.660> they<00:03:09.080> could<00:03:09.260> even<00:03:09.410> charge

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:09.800 
considering that they could even charge

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:12.430 
considering that they could even charge
if<00:03:10.010> they<00:03:10.130> wanted<00:03:10.430> to<00:03:10.610> I<00:03:10.640> guess<00:03:10.730> I<00:03:11.180> mean<00:03:11.720> if<00:03:12.380> they

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440 
if they wanted to I guess I mean if they

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.320 
if they wanted to I guess I mean if they
really<00:03:12.769> wanted<00:03:13.160> to<00:03:13.310> it<00:03:13.519> would<00:03:13.640> be<00:03:13.760> a<00:03:13.790> plus<00:03:14.090> on

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:14.330 
really wanted to it would be a plus on

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:17.259 
really wanted to it would be a plus on
their<00:03:14.540> side<00:03:14.780> number<00:03:15.739> two<00:03:15.950> and<00:03:16.880> this<00:03:16.910> is<00:03:17.150> where

00:03:17.259 --> 00:03:17.269 
their side number two and this is where

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:18.820 
their side number two and this is where
I<00:03:17.300> was<00:03:17.480> kind<00:03:17.690> of<00:03:17.720> debating<00:03:18.019> on<00:03:18.200> whether<00:03:18.470> what

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:18.830 
I was kind of debating on whether what

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:20.860 
I was kind of debating on whether what
if<00:03:19.340> I<00:03:19.489> should<00:03:19.700> make<00:03:20.030> this<00:03:20.150> number<00:03:20.420> two<00:03:20.600> if<00:03:20.750> I

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:20.870 
if I should make this number two if I

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:22.720 
if I should make this number two if I
should<00:03:21.050> make<00:03:21.170> this<00:03:21.290> number<00:03:21.620> one<00:03:21.860> number<00:03:22.550> two

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:22.730 
should make this number one number two

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:27.220 
should make this number one number two
would<00:03:23.030> be<00:03:23.239> a<00:03:23.420> huge<00:03:24.400> expansive<00:03:25.420> story<00:03:26.420> mode<00:03:26.690> DLC

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:30.040 
would be a huge expansive story mode DLC
now<00:03:27.860> we've<00:03:28.010> already<00:03:28.220> heard<00:03:28.489> rumors<00:03:29.000> of<00:03:29.050> DLC

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:30.050 
now we've already heard rumors of DLC

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:33.729 
now we've already heard rumors of DLC
being<00:03:30.370> created<00:03:31.370> for<00:03:31.610> the<00:03:31.850> story<00:03:32.150> mode<00:03:32.450> and<00:03:32.739> the

00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:33.739 
being created for the story mode and the

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:35.140 
being created for the story mode and the
speculation<00:03:34.400> is<00:03:34.580> that<00:03:34.610> it<00:03:34.820> is<00:03:34.910> involved

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.150 
speculation is that it is involved

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:38.110 
speculation is that it is involved
Franklin<00:03:35.959> so<00:03:36.950> we're<00:03:37.130> not<00:03:37.250> too<00:03:37.459> sure<00:03:37.489> yet<00:03:37.940> if

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:38.120 
Franklin so we're not too sure yet if

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:39.699 
Franklin so we're not too sure yet if
that's<00:03:38.330> the<00:03:38.480> case<00:03:38.660> but<00:03:38.720> if<00:03:39.080> that<00:03:39.290> is<00:03:39.500> the<00:03:39.680> case

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:39.709 
that's the case but if that is the case

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:42.699 
that's the case but if that is the case
then<00:03:40.269> we're<00:03:41.269> gonna<00:03:41.420> be<00:03:41.660> looking<00:03:42.380> at<00:03:42.500> something

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:42.709 
then we're gonna be looking at something

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:44.590 
then we're gonna be looking at something
really<00:03:43.160> cool<00:03:43.340> and<00:03:43.580> I<00:03:43.610> would<00:03:43.790> really<00:03:44.120> like<00:03:44.420> to

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:44.600 
really cool and I would really like to

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:47.890 
really cool and I would really like to
see<00:03:44.810> a<00:03:45.019> huge<00:03:45.800> story<00:03:46.519> mode<00:03:46.820> DLC<00:03:47.360> just<00:03:47.600> because<00:03:47.870> I

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:47.900 
see a huge story mode DLC just because I

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:51.009 
see a huge story mode DLC just because I
like<00:03:48.709> story<00:03:49.100> mode<00:03:49.370> so<00:03:49.700> much<00:03:49.970> that<00:03:50.390> I<00:03:50.420> felt<00:03:50.810> like

00:03:51.009 --> 00:03:51.019 
like story mode so much that I felt like

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:53.470 
like story mode so much that I felt like
I<00:03:51.170> just<00:03:51.230> wanted<00:03:51.590> more<00:03:51.980> and<00:03:52.239> not<00:03:53.239> that<00:03:53.390> it

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:53.480 
I just wanted more and not that it

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:55.600 
I just wanted more and not that it
wasn't<00:03:53.570> good<00:03:53.900> because<00:03:54.140> it<00:03:54.380> was<00:03:54.470> amazing<00:03:54.950> but<00:03:55.550> I

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:55.610 
wasn't good because it was amazing but I

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:57.729 
wasn't good because it was amazing but I
think<00:03:55.940> that<00:03:56.000> more<00:03:56.540> is<00:03:56.720> always<00:03:56.989> better<00:03:57.140> in<00:03:57.620> the

00:03:57.729 --> 00:03:57.739 
think that more is always better in the
