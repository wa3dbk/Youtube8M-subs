00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:09.400
 Yes, let's think about the structure in the PC 

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:11.460
 To stop always in front of the eyes 

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:14.760
 Computer Aiko 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:17.730
 Before ex, it was called My Computer, but 

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:21.930
 Please try a little click on it if there is an icon 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:27.800
 Hey I see the structure of the personal computer towards Then ho's 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:31.970
 Big c drive and d drive after There are two this 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:34.670
 There is also an i drive and an e drive that I use when watching cd and dvd 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:37.329
 Also usually c drive and d drive 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:40.559
 It is that this is divided into two large 

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:40.559
 Please understand this first 

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:51.620
 If you illustrate the current story, there is a PC 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:55.910
 It is that in which there is a c drive of the room and d drive of the room is in the personal computer 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:01:01.160
 And various files in the area on the stop 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:01.800
 Save the folder, but it is actually this top is in this c drive 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:02.650
 Exist 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.199
 Isn't it 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:05.740
 Although it is written here 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:11.259
 To the end 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:13.119
 Document xp if it is before this also it was Mashi form called My Documents also Actually c 

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:16.420
 It means that it is in the drive 

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:22.110
 The image I saw earlier is this explorer 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:26.910
 Kedomo those who use the tongue to more than fish through the loose tree PC is what Kore 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:28.440
 The point is that the local disk 4 c drive here is the disk in the corridor d 

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:33.420
 I call it a drive 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:35.620
 It means that there are two rooms in this big two and this I just went this 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:39.770
 Top or after 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:42.770
 It is a document. This is actually this 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:45.789
 In the 4 c drive of the local disk 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.789
 It's such to say so 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:02:01.560
 And the jaw and I right-click and click the later start button in the Explorer 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:04.650
 It's you look at even this 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:07.070
 Let's expand and enlarge this a little 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:07.070
 In this 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:17.790
 So there was a new minute I saw it a while ago 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:22.410
 For example with my computer guy this click on the top 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:27.000
 Imagine at stop by iphone This will appear in the j clothes 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:29.310
 For example, if you click on drive c here , the folder that is now on drive c 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:33.360
 File is displayed in your native language 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:34.510
 Folder, which is in the d drive and after a click on the d drive 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.780
 Or old 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:36.780
 But 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.930
 Comp you want to see earlier 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:52.270
 like this 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:57.130
 Keep in mind that it is in the structure of a personal computer 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:03:00.540
 Where in the world do you want to create, for example, folders or whatever? 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:03.170
 Do you want to save? D 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:07.680
 That kind of image is 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:10.450
 The contents of the PC structure of the mare have not been raised to grasp 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:15.220
 Where did you save your folder 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:16.970
 When I imagined where that file is on a PC 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:18.510
 First of all to understand 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:21.560
 PC's 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:23.069
 It is contents It is structure in PC 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:25.700
 I tried to talk 

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:25.700
 that's all
