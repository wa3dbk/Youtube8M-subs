00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:11.490
 welcome to this new video that 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.320
 bears on the theme stays for life in 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.480
 colors that's the secret of happiness I 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.400
 decided to make him pop art deals 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.189
 since it's an art that stands out 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.960
 by its very colorful side for this first 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.939
 the flock we're going to need 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.260
 canes is clean obviously the 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.150
 mark is not important 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.949
 it's hard to paint on the 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.720
 smooth surface of the cans so for 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.850
 prepare the surface so that they are 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.469
 well matt and well adherent no it's 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.079
 first a first coat of paint 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:39.000
 very thick and then layer 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.430
 thick the colors you want 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.200
 put on canes is if you missed 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.450
 your coloring and wanted to start again 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.430
 draw a little bit on the pension me 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.320
 dry it comes off all alone and you 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.120
 have a cane is like new take off 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.289
 the overflows of paint once 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.270
 that it is dry 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.370
 scratching with a scalpel on the 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.199
 bobbin I printed the writing coca 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.059
 cola to sizes suitable for my 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.590
 cannes is of course you can 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.239
 write something else on it 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.189
 I then cut out the black letters 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.670
 alex naming scalpel to create a 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.650
 stencil 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.119
 do not worry if your pocket is 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.020
 is not perfect it's almost 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.720
 impossible mission 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.580
 hung on to your bobbin and pat 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.950
 from above with a sponge soaked in 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.560
 paint to avoid smudging 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.509
 the very little in painting so the left 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.520
 we were allowed to create a base to 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.540
 writing coca cola now take 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.520
 the real cans 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.460
 take your time nothing brushes and 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.070
 wrote it yourself it's a lot 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.270
 easier than we might think 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.560
 I'm finished by doing 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.210
 paint stains from all 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.210
 colors and your can is over 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:46.370
 the second is there is a chart at the 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:49.070
 way of roy lichtenstein 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:51.200
 to start you have to have a base and 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:53.360
 so take a picture did not take it 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.100
 in profile or face you have to be 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.260
 slightly slanted to make it 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.210
 better print it then in black and 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:01.070
 white instead of cmfi I finally 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:02.060
 opted to put its timer 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:03.710
 camera 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.300
 I have a sad look on my picture if you 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:06.830
 do some research on the internet you 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:08.780
 will see that many tables your 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:10.369
 parts in this style represent 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:12.350
 women crying I drew 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:14.240
 the eyebrows by accentuating their side 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:16.459
 internal to the water to give a 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:18.440
 sadder aspect I then drew 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:20.660
 the nose starting by doing the stop 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:22.490
 from the nostrils and I modeled the 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:24.140
 wings of the nose by small strokes makes 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:25.640
 then the turn of the lips you can 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.320
 lengthen corner of the mouth to give 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.330
 a sad aspect then makes the 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:30.950
 turn of your face is marked by 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:32.780
 very thick lines the movements 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:34.550
 main of your hair do not hesitate 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.860
 to make thick strokes the rendering does not 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:38.510
 will be that better also does the trick of 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:38.840
 pupils for my part I added the 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:41.060
 arms 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:43.160
 school would then have your drawing for the 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.810
 skin I made pink dots I 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.040
 then simply coloring my 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:50.080
 hair in yellow 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:50.080
 my lips in red and my eyes in blue 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:02.810
 then take the white paint 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.760
 added a reflection in the eyes and a 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:06.350
 high level of the upper lip is 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.120
 passed over the teeth so 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:09.950
 to remove the too realistic side 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:12.140
 flip your sheet is folded in 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:13.820
 all the borders for that cut a 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:16.000
 little notch at each corner of the 

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:16.000
 leaf 

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:30.880
 then make the markings of your 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:30.880
 folded sheet on a brake carton 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:35.980
 cut it by following your benchmarks 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:54.900
 fold the borders of your sheet 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:58.459
 that we folded previously on the 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:58.459
 cardboard and stapled them 

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:18.890
 the staples left traces on 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:21.170
 my drawing so in order to camouflage I 

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:23.380
 decided to color the white part of 

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:26.150
 my photo using a pot this black case 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:27.920
 the latest pop art creation is from 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:30.020
 warhol andy style so she is 

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:31.610
 really super simple to carry out it 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:33.230
 would be suitable for other children to 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:35.150
 joning just make a background 

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:36.919
 photo montage with four square photos 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:37.310
 and color them with different 

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:39.230
 colors 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:40.850
 I hope you enjoyed the video 

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:42.050
 that one do not hesitate to leave me 

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:46.060
 comments it's always 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:46.060
 pleasure and we say ah the next
