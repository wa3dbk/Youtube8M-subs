about bringing it over the United States
but<00:00:11.730> we<00:00:11.849> wanted<00:00:12.090> to<00:00:12.150> do<00:00:12.300> an<00:00:12.420> electric<00:00:12.900> bike<00:00:13.080> how

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
but we wanted to do an electric bike how

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:15.950 
but we wanted to do an electric bike how
specialized<00:00:14.670> does<00:00:14.940> everything<00:00:15.299> so<00:00:15.809> when

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
specialized does everything so when

we worked really heavily on this for the
past<00:01:10.290> three<00:01:10.710> years<00:01:10.890> to<00:01:11.100> try<00:01:11.250> to<00:01:11.310> get<00:01:11.490> out<00:01:11.580> of

past three years to try to get out of

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:12.830 
past three years to try to get out of
bike<00:01:11.820> that<00:01:12.030> was<00:01:12.060> really<00:01:12.299> going<00:01:12.390> to<00:01:12.479> refalo

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
bike that was really going to refalo

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.690 
bike that was really going to refalo
revolutionize<00:01:13.619> what<00:01:13.950> electric<00:01:14.369> bikes<00:01:14.580> are

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
revolutionize what electric bikes are

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.940 
revolutionize what electric bikes are
all<00:01:14.820> about<00:01:15.000> right<00:01:15.479> so<00:01:16.170> this<00:01:16.530> may<00:01:16.680> come<00:01:16.830> in<00:01:16.890> a

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
all about right so this may come in a

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.260 
all about right so this may come in a
Canadian<00:01:17.280> market<00:01:17.580> what<00:01:17.880> do<00:01:17.939> you<00:01:18.000> think<00:01:18.150> it

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
Canadian market what do you think it

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.929 
Canadian market what do you think it
might<00:01:18.540> go<00:01:18.750> for<00:01:18.990> right<00:01:19.920> now<00:01:19.950> it's<00:01:20.220> going<00:01:20.520> in<00:01:20.670> the

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
might go for right now it's going in the

might go for right now it's going in the
European<00:01:21.420> markets<00:01:21.780> were<00:01:21.990> launching<00:01:22.740> it<00:01:22.860> next

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
European markets were launching it next

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.480 
European markets were launching it next
year<00:01:23.189> around<00:01:23.580> 50<00:01:24.270> 400<00:01:24.930> euro<00:01:25.140> so<00:01:26.100> it's<00:01:26.250> a<00:01:26.310> pretty

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
year around 50 400 euro so it's a pretty

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.010 
year around 50 400 euro so it's a pretty
expensive<00:01:26.700> bike<00:01:27.119> but<00:01:27.570> we<00:01:27.630> want<00:01:27.780> to<00:01:27.840> make<00:01:27.930> sure

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
expensive bike but we want to make sure

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.270 
expensive bike but we want to make sure
that<00:01:28.229> we<00:01:28.290> were<00:01:28.380> getting<00:01:28.560> the<00:01:28.619> technology<00:01:29.159> and

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
that we were getting the technology and

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.800 
that we were getting the technology and
rather<00:01:29.610> than<00:01:29.759> dumbing<00:01:30.150> it<00:01:30.210> down<00:01:30.270> and<00:01:30.630> really

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
rather than dumbing it down and really

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.170 
rather than dumbing it down and really
making<00:01:30.990> it<00:01:31.170> to<00:01:31.380> a<00:01:31.409> point<00:01:31.710> where<00:01:31.939> it<00:01:32.939> wouldn't

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
making it to a point where it wouldn't
