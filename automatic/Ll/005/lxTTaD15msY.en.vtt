this<00:01:28.609> use<00:01:28.909> which<00:01:29.509> means<00:01:29.750> they've<00:01:29.899> got<00:01:30.049> very

00:01:30.249 --> 00:01:30.259 
this use which means they've got very

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:32.319 
this use which means they've got very
singable<00:01:30.649> choruses<00:01:31.280> and<00:01:31.310> the<00:01:31.640> medical

00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:32.329 
singable choruses and the medical

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:34.630 
singable choruses and the medical
students<00:01:32.659> can<00:01:32.780> sing<00:01:33.020> along<00:01:33.140> and<00:01:33.590> learn<00:01:34.280> some

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:34.640 
students can sing along and learn some

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.880 
students can sing along and learn some
some<00:01:35.149> microbiology<00:01:36.020> and<00:01:36.259> I<00:01:36.320> kind<00:01:36.530> of<00:01:36.590> use<00:01:36.710> this

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:36.890 
some microbiology and I kind of use this

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:38.950 
some microbiology and I kind of use this
instead<00:01:37.249> of<00:01:37.310> a<00:01:37.460> summary<00:01:37.820> slide<00:01:37.969> I<00:01:38.450> think<00:01:38.689> it's

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:38.960 
instead of a summary slide I think it's

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:40.989 
instead of a summary slide I think it's
a<00:01:39.049> much<00:01:39.200> more<00:01:39.380> effective<00:01:39.649> thing<00:01:40.070> than<00:01:40.280> a<00:01:40.520> slide

00:01:40.989 --> 00:01:40.999 
a much more effective thing than a slide

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:43.359 
a much more effective thing than a slide
listing<00:01:41.509> the<00:01:41.630> teaching<00:01:42.229> points<00:01:42.590> a<00:01:42.710> a<00:01:42.920> song

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:43.369

listing the teaching points a a song
with<00:01:43.640> the<00:01:43.759> teaching<00:01:44.090> points<00:01:44.420> all<00:01:44.539> in<00:01:44.570> it<00:01:44.899> and<00:01:45.049> I

00:01:45.669 --> 00:01:45.679 
with the teaching points all in it and I

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:47.859 
with the teaching points all in it and I
kind<00:01:46.009> of<00:01:46.070> use<00:01:46.280> one<00:01:46.939> song<00:01:47.240> for<00:01:47.420> every<00:01:47.600> block<00:01:47.840> of

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
school performance from the music it's

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:53.990 
school performance from the music it's
hard<00:02:52.169> to<00:02:52.290> do<00:02:52.409> the<00:02:52.620> controlled<00:02:53.159> experiment<00:02:53.849> if

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
hard to do the controlled experiment if

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.390 
hard to do the controlled experiment if
I<00:02:54.150> did<00:02:54.750> the<00:02:54.900> songs<00:02:55.169> one<00:02:55.500> year<00:02:55.769> and<00:02:55.919> then<00:02:56.040> didn't

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
I did the songs one year and then didn't

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:57.740 
I did the songs one year and then didn't
do<00:02:56.489> it<00:02:56.579> the<00:02:56.730> next<00:02:56.909> year<00:02:57.150> I<00:02:57.180> might<00:02:57.450> get<00:02:57.629> in

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
do it the next year I might get in

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.149 
do it the next year I might get in
trouble<00:02:58.109> with<00:02:58.169> the<00:02:58.230> class<00:02:58.530> that<00:02:58.799> didn't<00:02:59.010> get

00:02:59.149 --> 00:02:59.159 
trouble with the class that didn't get

00:02:59.159 --> 00:03:03.229 
trouble with the class that didn't get
the<00:02:59.280> songs<00:03:00.829> but<00:03:01.829> they<00:03:02.010> do<00:03:02.069> mention<00:03:02.700> the<00:03:02.969> songs

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 
the songs but they do mention the songs

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:05.330 
the songs but they do mention the songs
and<00:03:03.510> their<00:03:03.599> course<00:03:03.810> evaluations<00:03:04.500> and<00:03:04.919> every

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
and their course evaluations and every

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:06.979 
and their course evaluations and every
so<00:03:05.519> often<00:03:05.669> I<00:03:05.849> have<00:03:06.030> a<00:03:06.060> third<00:03:06.359> or<00:03:06.540> fourth<00:03:06.569> year

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989 
so often I have a third or fourth year

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:08.839 
so often I have a third or fourth year
student<00:03:07.349> come<00:03:07.530> up<00:03:07.680> to<00:03:07.799> me<00:03:07.889> and<00:03:08.010> say<00:03:08.189> you<00:03:08.730> know<00:03:08.760> I

00:03:08.839 --> 00:03:08.849 
student come up to me and say you know I

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:10.580 
student come up to me and say you know I
remember<00:03:09.090> your<00:03:09.419> songs<00:03:09.719> and<00:03:09.989> I<00:03:10.049> remember<00:03:10.439> how

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
remember your songs and I remember how

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.589 
remember your songs and I remember how
to<00:03:10.650> treat<00:03:11.040> Lyme<00:03:11.280> disease<00:03:11.700> because<00:03:12.419> it's

00:03:12.589 --> 00:03:12.599 
to treat Lyme disease because it's

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:14.030 
to treat Lyme disease because it's
mentioned<00:03:12.810> in<00:03:13.079> the<00:03:13.199> chorus<00:03:13.530> of<00:03:13.680> your<00:03:13.829> song

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
mentioned in the chorus of your song

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.610 
mentioned in the chorus of your song
about<00:03:14.220> Lyme<00:03:14.549> disease<00:03:14.909> so<00:03:15.629> I<00:03:15.659> think<00:03:15.780> that<00:03:16.440> at

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
about Lyme disease so I think that at

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.309 
about Lyme disease so I think that at
least<00:03:16.650> is<00:03:17.010> evidence<00:03:17.430> that<00:03:18.260> these<00:03:19.260> are

00:03:19.309 --> 00:03:19.319 
least is evidence that these are

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:23.869 
least is evidence that these are
