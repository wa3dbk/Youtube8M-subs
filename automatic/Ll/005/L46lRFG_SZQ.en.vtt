00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.160
 a more united Europe needs austerity 

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:22.420
 tax from germany brought us 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.279
 to the recession 

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:27.220
 today's Europe is a problem 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:28.869
 an imposition there is a different europe one 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:31.000
 europe in which everyone must be able to count 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:32.830
 contribute in the same way 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.780
 Europe must be the synthesis of all 

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:36.930
 member states with a single e 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:39.640
 shared economic and fiscal policy 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.300
 with a single and shared policy of the 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:45.040
 defense and therefore with a common army 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.930
 only a united and respectful of Europe 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:49.329
 all member states will be able to face 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:50.680
 the challenges of today and tomorrow 

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:53.559
 the Italian presidency semester 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:56.140
 of the European Union that will start from 

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:58.870
 first July must be characterized as 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:00.579
 constituent semester that leads us to 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:02.980
 have more European institutions 

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:05.740
 that demonstrate the most effective 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:08.289
 and efficient able to help 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:10.570
 most technologically advanced companies 

00:01:08.289 --> 00:01:13.780
 able to move towards markets 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:16.539
 far away and compete with quality brands and 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:19.630
 technologies and not simply on costs 

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:20.830
 the estate during the crisis and then the 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:22.960
 slight recovery of ours 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:24.700
 exports that brought a 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:26.770
 improvement of the trade balance 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.210
 they are the result of these 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:30.430
 transformations of the production system 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:32.500
 so to speak we had 30 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:34.509
 billions of positivity we must seek 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:37.000
 to do more and increase this 

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:38.979
 difference is absolutely creating the 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.619
 competitiveness that makes us unique in the 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:44.110
 world and ensures that Italy can be 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:45.280
 really different as germany has 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:48.400
 tried to be in these years 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:50.259
 Italy can do more than I can 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:52.240
 change the past but with yours 

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:54.630
 consent I can try to improve the 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.630
 our future 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:01.840
 power 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.640
 before
