00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360
 so that again and again today one 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.370
 nice combination 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:09.120
 I can explain the boss once has 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:11.490
 submitted and also a great thing 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.259
 to the opponent early on the boards 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.500
 to send 

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:19.410
 we'll start off easy 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:24.480
 I will do it exactly then 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:25.890
 until now existed then you take then 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.960
 again the next step for now 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.429
 comes the strong that is there the 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.880
 coverage of the opponent once successfully sent to 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.160
 clear 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.170
 he pulls here nicely in the semicircle 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.899
 once at the cover to the side 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.100
 to beat 

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:39.629
 once the cover is off and then pull 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.010
 right after we click the hai to 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.040
 neck we are again pretty close 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:48.120
 So meet with the lower shin bone 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:50.340
 beautiful strong while the inorganic 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.809
 explained in detail but in the next 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.750
 videos you can sometimes the single technology 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:01:00.840
 show 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:01:04.100
 not so fast not so fast 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:07.400
 I try to introduce the leg 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:10.380
 alternated a vigorous outside round 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:15.090
 pull the cover away 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.090
 after the opponent on the boards 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:43.240
 but small mini rapture and deep 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:45.399
 once the blankets are gone but not that good 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.450
 does not have to be so fast in a row 

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:48.009
 came with his legs 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:51.390
 then just a little break inside 

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:53.709
 then you have a little time again 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:02:01.420
 to be good to the lotter there 

00:01:53.709 --> 00:02:02.799
 Bringing solid was so beautiful worries 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:16.209
 always for the result between Munich 

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:19.500
 even out of the cover is still coming 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:19.500
 take a short break 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:34.560
 this mini break before the last clear 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:36.840
 we bring everything exactly that was nice 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.150
 the whole new trend sport is still sending 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:42.170
