00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:09.240
 the mezquitic zoo in san 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.010
 Luis Potosí recorded the birth of 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.680
 three specimens of white tigers of 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.539
 Bengal gives us great pleasure because 

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:17.580
 we have had two offspring in 

00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:20.340
 this zoo children of this 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:23.070
 same copy that were born in 2008 and 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.050
 in 2009 and now 2012 we have the 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.789
 surprise that these pups are colored 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.400
 white that unlike the last time 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.380
 the tigers were red 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.270
 birth of these tigers 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.390
 flare whites happened the past 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.670
 Tuesday May 22 are in perfect 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.550
 conditions the female gave birth on its own 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.320
 did not require support was nothing he 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.600
 was watching the copy that everything 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.030
 come out perfect the pups are 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:51.420
 feeding very well they are taking weight 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:54.510
 are you all saw them very healthy 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.190
 is a mother that we have very tender very 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.469
 loving and that is something that to us 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.140
 It gives us a lot of peace because we can 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.789
 say that this is going to be a success in the 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.500
 development of the specimens 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.750
 birth in captivity is one of the 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.550
 measures that the mexquitic zoo has 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.979
 carried out for the conservation of 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:11.130
 the species in danger of extinction 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:13.320
 is it so 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.000
 danger of extinction the species we 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.450
 We are trying to put our 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.789
 seeds in terms of conservation in 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.070
 reality there are in many zoos is 

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:25.079
 the white tiger is not in everything is 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.479
 carrying out the reproduction and I think 

00:01:25.079 --> 00:01:28.979
 that this is an achievement that the park has 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.049
 zoo san luis potosí of which 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.939
 we can be proud of both the 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:35.159
 potosinos like Mexicans is 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:37.350
 White tigress of Bengal was confiscated 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:40.439
 in 2001 and since then it remains in 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:43.500
 captivity this copy was seized 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:45.659
 on a road a long time ago to a 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.490
 circus and we were left in the custody of 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.229
 san luis potosí zoo park east 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.240
 zoo also has programs of 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.979
 conservation of species such as fish 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.349
 of Mexican inland waters that are 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:59.750
 in serious danger of extinction in san
