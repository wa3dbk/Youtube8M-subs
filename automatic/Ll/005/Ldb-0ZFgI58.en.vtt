here on my other devices that's capable
of<00:00:27.900> that<00:00:28.080> i<00:00:33.410> might<00:00:34.410> do<00:00:34.559> separate<00:00:34.980> videos<00:00:35.489> as

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:51.160 
yeah I know there's a lot of tapping

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:56.700 
yeah I know there's a lot of tapping
here<00:00:52.500> so<00:00:53.500> we<00:00:53.920> have<00:00:54.070> the<00:00:54.220> app<00:00:54.340> open<00:00:54.580> up<00:00:54.850> and<00:00:55.710> it's

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:56.710 
here so we have the app open up and it's

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:59.670 
here so we have the app open up and it's
the<00:00:56.950> Aqua<00:00:57.280> speed<00:00:58.059> test<00:00:58.270> app<00:00:58.450> I'm<00:00:59.380> just<00:00:59.500> going

the Aqua speed test app I'm just going

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:05.609 
the Aqua speed test app I'm just going
to<00:00:59.739> go<00:00:59.920> in<00:00:59.950> here<00:01:00.190> to<00:01:00.820> see<00:01:01.180> if<00:01:02.010> I'm<00:01:03.010> running<00:01:04.619> bv

a<00:01:15.369> sort<00:01:15.970> of<00:01:16.030> here<00:01:16.240> with<00:01:16.450> the<00:01:16.660> DM<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:18.610> iphone<00:01:18.850> 6

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:18.970 
a sort of here with the DM the iphone 6

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:39.640 

80-90<00:01:37.850> based<00:01:38.150> on<00:01:38.330> crank<00:01:38.570> over<00:01:38.720> 100<00:01:39.350> which<00:01:39.470> is<00:01:39.500> a

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:39.650 
80-90 based on crank over 100 which is a

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:48.030 
80-90 based on crank over 100 which is a
little<00:01:39.830> bit<00:01:40.009> weird<00:01:40.570> it<00:01:41.570> should<00:01:42.500> be<00:01:42.680> I<00:01:42.710> think

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:48.040 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:52.139 

hmm<00:01:49.390> uploaded<00:01:50.390> lace<00:01:50.600> that's<00:01:50.780> maxed<00:01:51.259> out<00:01:51.380> but

00:01:52.139 --> 00:01:52.149 
hmm uploaded lace that's maxed out but

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:54.550 
hmm uploaded lace that's maxed out but
many<00:01:53.149> of<00:01:53.240> my<00:01:53.360> android<00:01:53.720> smartphones<00:01:54.170> they<00:01:54.380> can

many of my android smartphones they can

00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:01.719 
many of my android smartphones they can
always<00:01:54.830> get<00:01:55.009> like<00:01:55.250> over<00:01:55.759> over<00:02:00.070> the<00:02:01.070> 100<00:02:01.580> in

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:01.729 
always get like over over the 100 in

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:04.270 
always get like over over the 100 in
download<00:02:02.149> let's<00:02:03.080> see<00:02:03.229> if<00:02:03.289> the<00:02:03.409> iphone<00:02:03.530> 6<00:02:04.009> can

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:04.280 
download let's see if the iphone 6 can

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:09.729 
download let's see if the iphone 6 can
do<00:02:04.399> it<00:02:06.580> no<00:02:07.580> the<00:02:08.539> iphone<00:02:08.780> 6<00:02:08.929> seems<00:02:09.380> to<00:02:09.590> be<00:02:09.709> very

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:09.739 
do it no the iphone 6 seems to be very

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:11.800 
do it no the iphone 6 seems to be very
familiar<00:02:10.310> you're<00:02:10.700> also<00:02:10.940> a<00:02:11.180> little<00:02:11.510> bit<00:02:11.600> more

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 
familiar you're also a little bit more

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:13.360 
familiar you're also a little bit more
powerful<00:02:12.260> here<00:02:12.440> but<00:02:12.620> it<00:02:12.709> could<00:02:12.890> use<00:02:13.040> be<00:02:13.220> the

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
powerful here but it could use be the

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.660 
powerful here but it could use be the
randomness<00:02:13.760> of<00:02:13.880> course<00:02:14.870> if<00:02:15.620> you<00:02:15.800> want<00:02:16.040> a<00:02:16.190> super

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
randomness of course if you want a super

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.120 
randomness of course if you want a super
accurate<00:02:16.790> results<00:02:17.660> then<00:02:17.989> you<00:02:18.709> have<00:02:18.830> to<00:02:18.980> run

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.130 
accurate results then you have to run

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:22.210 
accurate results then you have to run
this<00:02:19.310> a<00:02:19.370> couple<00:02:19.700> of<00:02:19.760> times<00:02:19.910> of<00:02:20.209> course<00:02:21.220> but

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 
this a couple of times of course but

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.130 
this a couple of times of course but
nine<00:02:22.459> milliseconds<00:02:22.790> here<00:02:23.300> also<00:02:23.540> pain

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
nine milliseconds here also pain

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:31.509 
nine milliseconds here also pain
response<00:02:24.530> time<00:02:28.690> so<00:02:29.690> that<00:02:30.290> one<00:02:30.560> currently<00:02:31.400> the

00:02:31.509 --> 00:02:31.519 
response time so that one currently the

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:33.220 
response time so that one currently the
iphone<00:02:31.730> 6<00:02:31.880> is<00:02:32.060> later<00:02:32.360> but<00:02:32.660> usually<00:02:32.989> i<00:02:33.019> think

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
iphone 6 is later but usually i think

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.559 
iphone 6 is later but usually i think
the<00:02:33.290> iphone<00:02:33.560> 5s<00:02:34.069> or<00:02:34.280> iphone<00:02:34.340> 5<00:02:34.819> is<00:02:35.150> usually

00:02:35.559 --> 00:02:35.569 
the iphone 5s or iphone 5 is usually

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:39.640 
the iphone 5s or iphone 5 is usually
very<00:02:35.840> strong<00:02:36.500> here<00:02:36.739> in<00:02:36.860> this<00:02:37.010> test<00:02:37.510> from<00:02:38.650> my

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
very strong here in this test from my

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:46.330 
very strong here in this test from my
experience<00:02:44.140> sternum<00:02:45.140> big<00:02:45.320> difference<00:02:46.100> now

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
experience sternum big difference now

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:49.690 
experience sternum big difference now
it's<00:02:47.150> a<00:02:47.239> little<00:02:47.269> bit<00:02:47.570> faster<00:02:48.019> there<00:02:48.230> i<00:02:48.709> think<00:02:49.340> i

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 
it's a little bit faster there i think i

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:52.630 
it's a little bit faster there i think i
did<00:02:49.910> is<00:02:50.120> test<00:02:50.540> ones<00:02:50.870> as<00:02:51.230> well<00:02:51.260> on<00:02:52.190> a<00:02:52.250> couple<00:02:52.609> of

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 
did is test ones as well on a couple of

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.069 
did is test ones as well on a couple of
other<00:02:52.820> iphones<00:02:53.269> and<00:02:53.420> I<00:02:53.540> got<00:02:53.720> something

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:54.079 
other iphones and I got something

00:02:54.079 --> 00:02:58.870 
other iphones and I got something
similar<00:02:54.410> that<00:02:56.019> usually<00:02:57.019> each<00:02:57.440> new<00:02:57.950> iphone<00:02:58.579> is

00:02:58.870 --> 00:02:58.880 
similar that usually each new iphone is

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:02.640 
similar that usually each new iphone is
a<00:02:59.269> little<00:02:59.720> bit<00:02:59.840> of<00:02:59.959> a<00:03:00.019> step<00:03:00.290> up<00:03:00.440> in<00:03:00.730> download

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
a little bit of a step up in download

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:05.410 
a little bit of a step up in download
now<00:03:03.650> the<00:03:03.709> iphone<00:03:04.130> 5c<00:03:04.549> is<00:03:04.579> having<00:03:05.209> same

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.420 
now the iphone 5c is having same

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.990 
now the iphone 5c is having same
internals<00:03:05.989> usually<00:03:06.380> ask<00:03:06.530> the<00:03:06.829> iphone<00:03:07.160> 5<00:03:07.489> so

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
internals usually ask the iphone 5 so

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.310 
internals usually ask the iphone 5 so
probably<00:03:08.420> should<00:03:08.630> get<00:03:08.720> kind<00:03:09.019> of<00:03:09.079> similar

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:09.320 
probably should get kind of similar

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:11.440 
probably should get kind of similar
results<00:03:10.130> but<00:03:10.250> then<00:03:10.370> again<00:03:10.489> tells<00:03:10.850> a<00:03:10.940> plastic

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:11.450 
results but then again tells a plastic

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:18.729 
results but then again tells a plastic

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:32.810 
course it's going to be interesting to

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:35.800 
course it's going to be interesting to
see<00:03:32.930> here<00:03:33.140> if<00:03:33.230> the<00:03:33.350> iphone<00:03:33.500> 4s<00:03:34.280> can<00:03:34.670> keep<00:03:35.600> up

see here if the iphone 4s can keep up

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:39.400 
see here if the iphone 4s can keep up
here<00:03:36.400> with<00:03:37.400> these<00:03:37.730> other<00:03:38.000> phones<00:03:38.480> 92

the iPhone 5 is not gonna lose here the
iphone<00:03:52.420> 5<00:03:52.720> at<00:03:52.959> the<00:03:52.989> moment<00:03:53.560> is<00:03:54.180> the<00:03:55.180> the<00:03:56.080> ones

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:56.290 
iphone 5 at the moment is the the ones

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:01.080 
iphone 5 at the moment is the the ones
losing<00:03:56.560> the<00:03:56.950> most<00:03:57.069> lives<00:03:57.489> on<00:03:57.610> download<00:04:00.090> but

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:01.090 
losing the most lives on download but

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:04.280 
losing the most lives on download but
the<00:04:01.300> 5s<00:04:01.750> is<00:04:02.019> also<00:04:02.379> very<00:04:02.530> very<00:04:02.830> similar<00:04:03.280> but<00:04:03.610> it

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.290 
the 5s is also very very similar but it

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:06.809 
the 5s is also very very similar but it
had<00:04:05.290> a<00:04:05.319> little<00:04:05.590> bit<00:04:05.830> of<00:04:05.860> a<00:04:06.010> better<00:04:06.220> score<00:04:06.580> there

00:04:06.809 --> 00:04:06.819 
had a little bit of a better score there

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:12.390 
had a little bit of a better score there
on<00:04:07.290> the<00:04:08.290> 55<00:04:09.269> s<00:04:10.269> like<00:04:11.200> one<00:04:11.440> megabits<00:04:11.890> download

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:12.400 
on the 55 s like one megabits download

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.270 
on the 55 s like one megabits download
more<00:04:12.640> but<00:04:12.879> you<00:04:13.170> can<00:04:14.170> clearly<00:04:14.410> see<00:04:14.680> that<00:04:14.709> all<00:04:15.069> of

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:15.280 
more but you can clearly see that all of

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:17.039 
more but you can clearly see that all of
them<00:04:15.430> are<00:04:15.700> reversed<00:04:16.389> Miller<00:04:16.630> there<00:04:16.840> they're

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:17.049 
them are reversed Miller there they're

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:18.599 
them are reversed Miller there they're
maxing<00:04:17.410> out<00:04:17.470> upload<00:04:17.949> at<00:04:18.040> least<00:04:18.130> because<00:04:18.489> I

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:18.609 
maxing out upload at least because I

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:21.000 
maxing out upload at least because I
have<00:04:18.729> 50<00:04:19.120> minutes<00:04:19.150> upload<00:04:19.959> where<00:04:20.440> I<00:04:20.470> live<00:04:20.799> and

have 50 minutes upload where I live and

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:25.200 
have 50 minutes upload where I live and
like<00:04:21.310> 300<00:04:21.790> megabits<00:04:22.060> down<00:04:22.560> so<00:04:24.000> like<00:04:25.000> there's

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:25.210 
like 300 megabits down so like there's

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:27.000 
like 300 megabits down so like there's
no<00:04:25.300> major<00:04:25.570> big<00:04:25.900> difference<00:04:26.290> between<00:04:26.590> these<00:04:26.770> of

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:27.010 
no major big difference between these of

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:30.390 
no major big difference between these of
course<00:04:27.040> but<00:04:28.030> here<00:04:28.540> with<00:04:28.690> the<00:04:28.780> iphone<00:04:29.110> 4s<00:04:29.500> we're

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:30.400 
course but here with the iphone 4s we're

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.430 
course but here with the iphone 4s we're
really<00:04:30.669> struggling<00:04:31.000> here<00:04:31.240> at<00:04:31.960> least<00:04:32.169> getting

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:32.440 
really struggling here at least getting

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:35.700 
really struggling here at least getting
insanely<00:04:33.040> good<00:04:33.370> speeds<00:04:33.790> but<00:04:34.479> then<00:04:34.660> again<00:04:34.780> 2011

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:35.710 
insanely good speeds but then again 2011

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:39.690 
insanely good speeds but then again 2011
smartphone<00:04:36.660> so<00:04:37.680> don't<00:04:38.680> expect<00:04:38.860> too<00:04:39.100> much<00:04:39.430> but

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:39.700 
smartphone so don't expect too much but

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:41.760 
smartphone so don't expect too much but
it's<00:04:40.389> really<00:04:40.630> really<00:04:40.750> cool<00:04:41.169> here<00:04:41.380> to<00:04:41.560> see<00:04:41.740> a

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:41.770 
it's really really cool here to see a

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:45.439 
it's really really cool here to see a
years<00:04:42.310> difference<00:04:42.820> here<00:04:43.150> what<00:04:43.330> it<00:04:43.450> can<00:04:43.630> do

00:04:45.439 --> 00:04:45.449 
years difference here what it can do

00:04:45.449 --> 00:04:49.920 
years difference here what it can do
between<00:04:46.449> 2011<00:04:47.320> and<00:04:47.470> 2012<00:04:48.370> and<00:04:48.789> I<00:04:49.090> from<00:04:49.330> 5<00:04:49.660> is

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:49.930 
between 2011 and 2012 and I from 5 is

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:52.560 
between 2011 and 2012 and I from 5 is
like<00:04:50.169> so<00:04:50.470> much<00:04:50.590> more<00:04:50.650> worth<00:04:51.039> it<00:04:51.250> because<00:04:51.880> it<00:04:52.419> is

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:52.570 
like so much more worth it because it is

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:54.600 
like so much more worth it because it is
like<00:04:52.810> 20<00:04:53.200> 1<00:04:53.350> megabit<00:04:53.680> download<00:04:53.740> and<00:04:54.310> then<00:04:54.430> you

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:54.610 
like 20 1 megabit download and then you

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:56.400 
like 20 1 megabit download and then you
get<00:04:54.729> around<00:04:55.450> seven<00:04:55.840> to<00:04:55.930> one<00:04:56.050> megabit<00:04:56.350> download

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:56.410 
get around seven to one megabit download

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:57.930 
get around seven to one megabit download
I<00:04:56.830> mean<00:04:56.979> there's<00:04:57.190> a<00:04:57.250> big<00:04:57.310> difference<00:04:57.610> there

00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:57.940 
I mean there's a big difference there

00:04:57.940 --> 00:04:59.940 
I mean there's a big difference there
you<00:04:58.419> could<00:04:58.539> probably<00:04:58.750> even<00:04:59.080> myself<00:04:59.410> to<00:04:59.830> like

00:04:59.940 --> 00:04:59.950 
you could probably even myself to like

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:03.180 
you could probably even myself to like
90<00:05:00.430> so<00:05:00.729> winner<00:05:01.450> here<00:05:01.720> is<00:05:01.810> iphone<00:05:01.960> 6<00:05:02.320> and<00:05:02.590> then

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:03.190 
90 so winner here is iphone 6 and then

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:07.680 
90 so winner here is iphone 6 and then
the<00:05:03.310> 5c<00:05:03.910> and<00:05:05.070> then<00:05:06.070> 6<00:05:06.400> plus<00:05:06.610> and<00:05:07.240> then<00:05:07.570> the

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:07.690 
the 5c and then 6 plus and then the

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:12.510 
the 5c and then 6 plus and then the
iphone<00:05:08.050> 5s<00:05:08.470> be<00:05:09.430> five<00:05:09.700> and<00:05:10.060> then<00:05:10.570> before<00:05:10.750> us<00:05:11.520> on

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:12.520 
iphone 5s be five and then before us on

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:14.670 
iphone 5s be five and then before us on
upload<00:05:13.120> here<00:05:13.660> i<00:05:13.810> could<00:05:13.990> also<00:05:14.110> be<00:05:14.320> a<00:05:14.349> little<00:05:14.500> bit

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:14.680 
upload here i could also be a little bit

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:16.500 
upload here i could also be a little bit
more<00:05:14.860> fun<00:05:15.160> to<00:05:15.400> could<00:05:15.849> also<00:05:15.970> be<00:05:16.120> fun<00:05:16.300> to<00:05:16.389> check

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:16.510 
more fun to could also be fun to check

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:18.210 
more fun to could also be fun to check
out<00:05:16.660> then<00:05:17.139> why<00:05:17.260> should<00:05:17.440> you<00:05:17.500> have<00:05:17.650> the<00:05:17.740> 6<00:05:17.979> plus

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:18.220 
out then why should you have the 6 plus

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:27.150 
out then why should you have the 6 plus
first<00:05:18.580> and<00:05:21.900> then<00:05:22.900> we<00:05:23.050> do<00:05:23.169> get<00:05:23.440> the<00:05:24.539> 5c<00:05:26.160> at

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:27.160 
first and then we do get the 5c at
