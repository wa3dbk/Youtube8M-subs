00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.370
 I have entered 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:07.160
 Enter thank you 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:13.860
 Side-by-side two now have the will to 

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:13.860
 say contax 

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:21.710
 Manufacturer's 35 mm film 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:28.430
 It becomes a camera and the black one is normal contax aria 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:37.079
 Well, that kind of white or gold is a form called Contax 70th anniversary model 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:37.230
 Well, the price is completely different, and if it is this 70th anniversary and usual, it will be 3 to 4 times 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:42.540
 of 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:47.220
 c Re: I'm different, but the selling price may not be so different from linear one. 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:51.690
 Gamaoh This is pretty expensive if it is beautiful . 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:57.250
 So it's not so astonishingly so high but it's such a rarity 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:01:03.430
 There is a form that there is a here is this normal type is this 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:04.239
 It is black, but let me explain how to operate about that 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:06.610
 You will receive 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:11.440
 When you remove the cap 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:16.420
 First, whether or not the mirror there is no I in Cocos example is a mirror and a rear mount part because they come out 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:17.620
 If the color changes or not whether the brass is out there is a little back pain a little 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:20.750
 After all film 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:23.270
 Nde tree is the state of the film Nemaa that 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:26.810
 This is from here 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:31.000
 I'd open with the button when you open I'd open down the button 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:34.660
 If you're in the air, you won't close anything. 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:40.590
 There are a lot of systems and this is also a bit bad for the island 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:40.590
 So it 's pretty cheap but this is also the target or cn bar target 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:05.159
 here 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:10.800
 Please look at that shutter curtain here properly that there is a problem here 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:14.380
 Nde there is no value at all even cheaper want to look for I mean if you are shutter is neatly 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:18.460
 It's good, I hope this will never touch you 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:21.810
 That's to say that the upper part is tough if it is mac because it was more than just a curtain 

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:21.810
 I think that it is better to check is 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:28.489
 And after that sutter speed shutter speed is now turned on 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:32.190
 I'm saying above 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:37.670
 And the power I have you on 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:37.670
 Yeah it is that the shutter is going to see that I mean whether or not hear with your match Shin 

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:53.000
 I 'm off at the market right now 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:53.000
 In the case of this area, the left side is the shutter speed dial. 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:57.940
 Advo I thought it was a film counter here and checked whether there was any liquid crystal leak 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:00.360
 I will 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:03.520
 In particular place that I checked now 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:07.670
 For example Nde there is no problem in the direction of the shutter 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:13.400
 Well there is no problem in particular with anything like copying 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:19.880
 After it is okay in about there is something even a little thread wound to the outside of the wound is Yappa be around here 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:26.530
 This is the part of this that my head was in the not go 0-to-With or dented or damaged Nde stand out 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:29.930
 Because it is beautiful , I think that it will become that hill powerful one after all 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:32.310
 Also about 70 laps beautiful 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:37.080
 Checkpoint is most of the same 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:38.260
 You may check whether the price and its rarity match, but it is quite used up 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:39.880
 Has been 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:45.819
 However 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:50.049
 I feel that I wonder if the good can buy that Well Nde amazing cheap price 

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:54.040
 There are 8 things that are different earlier, but the black one is still this 

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:54.819
 But it was not from closing Te package This snack usually a do I'm put away by pressing left this 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:58.599
 Right 

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:59.049
 And that 's why it's cheap, but I don't understand it at all 

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:01.510
 Right? 

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:07.569
 It is that 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:08.829
 I do say Nante considerably profits as long to tell it or rather the underlying of the income 

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:12.010
 It will come out 

00:04:08.829 --> 00:04:17.879
 Kimono with that area 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:17.879
 It becomes part of the liver is that going to sing such an event of 

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:24.210
 That's it for 8 contax aria
