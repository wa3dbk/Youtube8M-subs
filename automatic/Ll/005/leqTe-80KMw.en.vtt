00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:53.430 
across the outside of the pot made it
too<00:02:50.440> fat<00:02:50.739> and<00:02:51.040> this<00:02:51.670> control<00:02:52.630> cavity<00:02:53.079> here<00:02:53.319> is

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
too fat and this control cavity here is

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.800 
too fat and this control cavity here is
really<00:02:53.890> tiny<00:02:54.130> so<00:02:54.849> you<00:02:54.880> have<00:02:55.030> to<00:02:55.150> stand<00:02:55.480> on<00:02:55.690> the

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810 
really tiny so you have to stand on the

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:58.110 
really tiny so you have to stand on the
pickguard<00:02:56.049> to<00:02:56.380> get<00:02:56.530> this<00:02:56.709> in<00:02:57.010> I<00:02:57.190> would<00:02:57.970> never

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
pickguard to get this in I would never

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.750 
pickguard to get this in I would never
hand<00:02:58.390> this<00:02:58.480> to<00:02:58.630> a<00:02:58.660> customer<00:02:59.140> like<00:02:59.319> that<00:02:59.760> and

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
hand this to a customer like that and

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.280 
hand this to a customer like that and
then<00:03:00.940> that<00:03:01.090> the<00:03:01.209> wire<00:03:01.450> he<00:03:01.720> uses<00:03:02.079> for<00:03:02.230> the

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
then that the wire he uses for the

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:03.839 
then that the wire he uses for the
switch<00:03:02.620> it's<00:03:02.829> really<00:03:03.099> thick<00:03:03.400> it's<00:03:03.610> really

00:03:03.839 --> 00:03:03.849 
switch it's really thick it's really

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:05.970 
switch it's really thick it's really
great<00:03:04.090> wire<00:03:04.329> but<00:03:04.900> it<00:03:04.989> makes<00:03:05.170> it<00:03:05.290> very<00:03:05.590> hard<00:03:05.739> to

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:05.980 
great wire but it makes it very hard to

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:08.039 
great wire but it makes it very hard to
stuff<00:03:06.280> it<00:03:06.430> all<00:03:06.549> in<00:03:06.579> there<00:03:06.940> so<00:03:07.720> I'm<00:03:07.810> gonna<00:03:07.900> have

00:03:08.039 --> 00:03:08.049 
stuff it all in there so I'm gonna have

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:09.599 
stuff it all in there so I'm gonna have
to<00:03:08.139> rework<00:03:08.470> that<00:03:08.680> with<00:03:08.950> some<00:03:09.100> thinner<00:03:09.340> wire

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:09.609 
to rework that with some thinner wire

00:03:09.609 --> 00:03:14.009 
to rework that with some thinner wire
and<00:03:10.560> but<00:03:11.560> yeah<00:03:12.209> again<00:03:13.209> I<00:03:13.480> don't<00:03:13.720> know<00:03:13.810> why<00:03:13.959> you

00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:14.019 
and but yeah again I don't know why you

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:16.140 
and but yeah again I don't know why you
wouldn't<00:03:14.260> get<00:03:14.410> a<00:03:14.440> black<00:03:14.650> top<00:03:14.920> tele<00:03:15.190> these

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
wouldn't get a black top tele these

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:18.930 
wouldn't get a black top tele these
lists<00:03:16.480> 411<00:03:17.079> black<00:03:17.680> tops<00:03:17.980> list<00:03:18.310> for<00:03:18.549> I<00:03:18.760> think

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:18.940 
lists 411 black tops list for I think

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:21.750 
lists 411 black tops list for I think
$7.99<00:03:19.690> and<00:03:19.959> they<00:03:20.769> have<00:03:20.920> two<00:03:21.190> standard

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:21.760 
$7.99 and they have two standard

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:23.160 
$7.99 and they have two standard
humbucker<00:03:22.120> holes<00:03:22.450> so<00:03:22.630> you<00:03:22.720> can<00:03:22.840> put<00:03:22.989> your<00:03:23.019> own

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:23.170 
humbucker holes so you can put your own

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:25.490 
humbucker holes so you can put your own
humbuckers<00:03:23.709> in<00:03:23.859> it<00:03:23.980> has<00:03:24.430> the<00:03:24.549> same<00:03:24.730> fix<00:03:25.060> bridge

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
humbuckers in it has the same fix bridge

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.979 
humbuckers in it has the same fix bridge
so<00:03:26.500> I<00:03:26.920> guess<00:03:27.760> it's<00:03:27.940> for<00:03:28.060> show<00:03:28.299> you<00:03:28.630> know<00:03:28.840> it's

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:28.989 
so I guess it's for show you know it's

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:32.009 
so I guess it's for show you know it's
got<00:03:29.139> the<00:03:29.230> CBS<00:03:29.680> headstock<00:03:30.190> and<00:03:30.220> the<00:03:31.019> different

got the CBS headstock and the different

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:34.110 
got the CBS headstock and the different
shape<00:03:32.230> but<00:03:32.280> yeah<00:03:33.280> I<00:03:33.310> don't<00:03:33.700> know<00:03:33.910> why<00:03:34.060> you

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.120 
shape but yeah I don't know why you

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:35.879
