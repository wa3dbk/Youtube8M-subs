00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:36.820
 and go down and what you want to be is a 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:39.400
 Celebration for the city of Barcelona 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:42.430
 and for the world of flamenco and the world 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:45.430
 gypsy is a project that arises from 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:47.140
 the need to talk about something that we 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:50.559
 belongs that is part of our 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:52.900
 roots the origin of the project was to speak 

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:55.210
 of flamenco and rumba also as 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:56.950
 forms of expression as art of the 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:59.290
 gypsy community that lives in barcelona 

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:01.600
 As you know, there are two communities 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:02.920
 gypsy that is expressed through the 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:06.400
 flamenco and the one that does it through 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:07.990
 rumba not the idea was to join big 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:10.479
 figures of these two of these two 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:12.520
 music of the rumba and flamenco and create 

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:15.400
 a show that show was called 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:17.650
 go down and directed him candid Alvarez like 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:20.650
 I told you and showed up at the Plaza de la 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:23.410
 mercy in the square of the cathedral in the 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:25.880
 Mercè Festival 2011 from 

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:28.340
 there what the movie did is 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:32.840
 is to follow all that process in which 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:35.539
 these these gypsy musicians met and 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:39.200
 they created the show that happened that 

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:40.909
 before starting the shoot agreed by 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.369
 those things 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:45.920
 do not know where it coincided that cary me 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:47.630
 loves since it is a direct family of 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.130
 Carmen Amaya, two months ago 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.890
 practically it had reached 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:53.750
 barcelona and that logically as it happens 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:56.810
 in the cinema of the real thing it changed 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:59.329
 totally the roadmap we had 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:01.310
 and he joined in that show of 

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:03.709
 way that became the protagonism 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:07.189
 to the protagonist of the movie next to 

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:09.229
 a child of Juanito who lives in San Roque 

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:11.150
 in the step of the festivals 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:13.190
 international has created a 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:15.650
 very large expectation around the 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:17.360
 idea of ​​flamenco and barcelona is not 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:20.660
 obvious that people are not very clear 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:22.129
 that in Barcelona there is flamenco not 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:25.220
 not even the figure of Carmen 

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:28.579
 amaya that everyone knows and is 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:31.750
 undoubted but very few people know that 

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:31.750
 was born in Barcelona 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:38.220
 I think it's not a paper, it's not paper 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:42.090
 my paper 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.960
 I do what I do, what I live is not a 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.670
 paper 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:47.930
 they just take me to know the 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:50.910
 source of my aunt Carmen and then it is a 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:53.430
 shocking to me is a shock not because 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:55.980
 not something very strong not knowing that she has 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.450
 been there that has already lived there water that 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.190
 she has been standing that she has put 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:02.160
 the feet from there for me was something very 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:03.810
 strong and something that also motivated me 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.250
 a lot because I would have loved that 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:07.560
 could have lived any of his 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:09.690
 sisters how was my mother with my aunt 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:12.390
 leos or my aunt maría 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:14.250
 for her, it would have been the same or 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:16.680
 stronger than what was for me the 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:19.030
 figure of carmen amaya has been has been 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:21.370
 popular in the world 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:22.460
 In the whole world Carmen Amaya is Carmen 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:25.790
 amaya 

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:27.260
 it was and still is in Mexico because it is 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:29.360
 the same thing as it can be in a 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:33.940
 Japan or in a new york or in any 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:33.940
