great coach John's gone is describe for

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:14.520 
great coach John's gone is describe for
us<00:00:10.000> the<00:00:10.059> principles<00:00:10.719> of<00:00:10.930> the<00:00:11.200> press<00:00:13.469> thanks<00:00:14.469> to

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:14.530 
us the principles of the press thanks to

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:19.260 
us the principles of the press thanks to
you<00:00:14.699> yeah<00:00:15.699> so<00:00:15.969> I<00:00:16.000> guess<00:00:16.390> the<00:00:17.100> main<00:00:18.100> focus<00:00:19.060> of

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:19.270 
you yeah so I guess the main focus of

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:24.600 
you yeah so I guess the main focus of
why<00:00:19.960> hockey<00:00:20.890> teams<00:00:21.580> press<00:00:22.200> is<00:00:23.220> to<00:00:24.220> put

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:24.610 
why hockey teams press is to put

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:27.810 
why hockey teams press is to put
pressure<00:00:24.880> and<00:00:25.180> hold<00:00:26.080> the<00:00:26.230> ball<00:00:26.440> in<00:00:26.740> the<00:00:27.430> hot

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:27.820 
pressure and hold the ball in the hot

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:32.729 
pressure and hold the ball in the hot
zones<00:00:28.090> and<00:00:29.100> the<00:00:30.100> best<00:00:31.320> principle<00:00:32.320> that<00:00:32.410> I<00:00:32.529> can

00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:32.739 
zones and the best principle that I can

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:35.790 
zones and the best principle that I can
sort<00:00:33.039> of<00:00:33.129> say<00:00:33.539> that<00:00:34.539> will<00:00:34.719> allow<00:00:35.020> you<00:00:35.469> to<00:00:35.500> work

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:35.800 
sort of say that will allow you to work

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.650 
sort of say that will allow you to work
out<00:00:36.040> how<00:00:36.220> to<00:00:36.250> do<00:00:36.550> it<00:00:36.700> or<00:00:36.940> what<00:00:37.150> the<00:00:37.239> principle

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:37.660 
out how to do it or what the principle

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:42.000 
out how to do it or what the principle
is<00:00:37.810> is<00:00:38.020> to<00:00:38.710> deny<00:00:38.890> all<00:00:39.610> passes<00:00:40.270> so<00:00:41.050> as<00:00:41.410> a<00:00:41.649> group

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:42.010 
is is to deny all passes so as a group

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:44.370 
is is to deny all passes so as a group
you're<00:00:42.160> trying<00:00:42.489> to<00:00:42.840> consider<00:00:43.840> that<00:00:44.079> as<00:00:44.230> your

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:44.380 
you're trying to consider that as your

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:47.340 
you're trying to consider that as your
primary<00:00:44.649> objective<00:00:44.860> and<00:00:45.460> then<00:00:46.120> set<00:00:46.960> up<00:00:47.079> around

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:47.350 
primary objective and then set up around

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:50.280 
primary objective and then set up around
that<00:00:47.620> if<00:00:47.980> we<00:00:48.730> look<00:00:48.880> at<00:00:49.000> the<00:00:49.120> board<00:00:49.360> here<00:00:49.660> some

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:50.290 
that if we look at the board here some

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:55.200 
that if we look at the board here some
of<00:00:50.410> the<00:00:50.500> key<00:00:51.899> things<00:00:52.899> if<00:00:53.260> the<00:00:53.980> defensive<00:00:54.579> group

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:55.210 
of the key things if the defensive group

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:58.889 
of the key things if the defensive group
in<00:00:55.450> the<00:00:55.840> red<00:00:56.050> have<00:00:56.530> a<00:00:56.559> back<00:00:56.829> three<00:00:57.540> and<00:00:58.540> in<00:00:58.780> the

00:00:58.889 --> 00:00:58.899 
in the red have a back three and in the

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:00.150 
in the red have a back three and in the
middle<00:00:59.140> of<00:00:59.230> the<00:00:59.320> field<00:00:59.590> where<00:00:59.860> the<00:00:59.950> ball<00:01:00.130> is

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:00.160 
middle of the field where the ball is

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.299 
middle of the field where the ball is
it's<00:01:01.090> a<00:01:01.180> lot<00:01:01.300> more<00:01:01.450> difficult<00:01:01.629> to<00:01:02.110> defend<00:01:02.309> but

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:03.309 
it's a lot more difficult to defend but

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:05.789 
it's a lot more difficult to defend but
the<00:01:03.460> central<00:01:03.879> striker<00:01:04.239> is<00:01:04.659> the<00:01:05.229> person<00:01:05.649> that

00:01:05.789 --> 00:01:05.799 
the central striker is the person that

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:09.660 
the central striker is the person that
sets<00:01:06.070> the<00:01:06.280> press<00:01:06.520> on<00:01:06.759> all<00:01:07.569> occasions<00:01:07.929> and<00:01:08.670> they

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:09.670 
sets the press on all occasions and they

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:11.309 
sets the press on all occasions and they
have<00:01:09.909> to<00:01:10.090> decide<00:01:10.389> whether<00:01:10.630> they<00:01:10.869> want<00:01:11.109> to

00:01:11.309 --> 00:01:11.319 
have to decide whether they want to

00:01:11.319 --> 00:01:13.800 
have to decide whether they want to
shift<00:01:11.709> the<00:01:11.859> ball<00:01:12.039> to<00:01:12.700> force<00:01:12.969> the<00:01:13.149> ball<00:01:13.329> to<00:01:13.689> this

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:13.810 
shift the ball to force the ball to this

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:16.260 
shift the ball to force the ball to this
side<00:01:14.079> of<00:01:14.139> the<00:01:14.229> field<00:01:14.409> or<00:01:15.310> allowed<00:01:15.700> to<00:01:15.729> come<00:01:16.119> to

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:16.270 
side of the field or allowed to come to

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:17.789 
side of the field or allowed to come to
this<00:01:16.389> side<00:01:16.630> of<00:01:16.689> the<00:01:16.749> field<00:01:17.020> in<00:01:17.200> this<00:01:17.319> instance

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:17.799 
this side of the field in this instance

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:19.649 
this side of the field in this instance
I've<00:01:18.009> set<00:01:18.249> up<00:01:18.280> a<00:01:18.579> little<00:01:18.909> bit<00:01:19.270> on<00:01:19.420> the<00:01:19.509> left

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:19.659 
I've set up a little bit on the left

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:22.139 
I've set up a little bit on the left
here<00:01:20.039> hopefully<00:01:21.039> to<00:01:21.189> shift<00:01:21.429> the<00:01:21.549> ball<00:01:21.729> over<00:01:21.909> to

00:01:22.139 --> 00:01:22.149 
here hopefully to shift the ball over to

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:25.019 
here hopefully to shift the ball over to
this<00:01:22.270> side<00:01:22.509> of<00:01:22.539> the<00:01:22.689> field<00:01:23.670> one<00:01:24.670> of<00:01:24.700> the<00:01:24.759> clean

00:01:25.019 --> 00:01:25.029 
this side of the field one of the clean

00:01:25.029 --> 00:01:26.999 
this side of the field one of the clean
important<00:01:25.479> factors<00:01:25.869> is<00:01:26.049> that<00:01:26.079> this<00:01:26.439> midfield

00:01:26.999 --> 00:01:27.009 
important factors is that this midfield

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:29.639 
important factors is that this midfield
and<00:01:27.249> the<00:01:28.209> relationship<00:01:28.899> between<00:01:29.049> midfield

00:01:29.639 --> 00:01:29.649 
and the relationship between midfield

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:32.219 
and the relationship between midfield
and<00:01:29.829> the<00:01:29.920> strikers<00:01:30.399> is<00:01:30.969> not<00:01:31.240> too<00:01:31.450> compressed<00:01:31.929> a

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:32.229 
and the strikers is not too compressed a

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:34.559 
and the strikers is not too compressed a
good<00:01:32.950> defender<00:01:33.310> would<00:01:33.579> be<00:01:33.729> able<00:01:33.819> to<00:01:33.999> penetrate

00:01:34.559 --> 00:01:34.569 
good defender would be able to penetrate

00:01:34.569 --> 00:01:37.319 
good defender would be able to penetrate
two<00:01:35.079> lines<00:01:35.349> with<00:01:35.709> one<00:01:35.920> here<00:01:36.159> so<00:01:37.119> it's<00:01:37.240> very

00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:37.329 
two lines with one here so it's very

00:01:37.329 --> 00:01:39.779 
two lines with one here so it's very
important<00:01:37.869> that<00:01:37.899> is<00:01:38.189> anxious<00:01:39.189> as<00:01:39.340> this<00:01:39.490> group

00:01:39.779 --> 00:01:39.789 
important that is anxious as this group

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:42.690 
important that is anxious as this group
is<00:01:39.969> to<00:01:40.179> move<00:01:40.329> forward<00:01:40.569> and<00:01:41.049> really<00:01:41.289> dress<00:01:41.700> you

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:42.700 
is to move forward and really dress you

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.669 
is to move forward and really dress you
can<00:01:42.880> over<00:01:43.149> press<00:01:43.389> so<00:01:43.569> it's<00:01:43.689> important<00:01:44.170> to

00:01:44.669 --> 00:01:44.679 
can over press so it's important to

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:47.309 
can over press so it's important to
maintain<00:01:44.859> that<00:01:45.479> what's<00:01:46.479> also<00:01:46.630> important<00:01:47.229> is

00:01:47.309 --> 00:01:47.319 
maintain that what's also important is

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:50.870 
maintain that what's also important is
to<00:01:47.499> bring<00:01:47.740> the<00:01:47.919> two<00:01:48.329> wing<00:01:49.329> strikers<00:01:49.869> in<00:01:50.079> a

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
to bring the two wing strikers in a

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.349 
to bring the two wing strikers in a
distance<00:01:52.109> enforce<00:01:53.109> the<00:01:53.289> ball<00:01:53.469> out<00:01:54.369> and<00:01:54.729> around

00:01:55.349 --> 00:01:55.359 
distance enforce the ball out and around

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:58.019 
distance enforce the ball out and around
as<00:01:55.689> opposed<00:01:56.289> to<00:01:56.409> through<00:01:56.709> these<00:01:56.919> channels<00:01:57.429> so

00:01:58.019 --> 00:01:58.029 
as opposed to through these channels so

00:01:58.029 --> 00:02:02.669 
as opposed to through these channels so
you're<00:01:58.209> trying<00:01:58.479> to<00:01:58.630> these<00:01:58.990> guys<00:01:59.229> have<00:01:59.469> to<00:02:01.679> not

00:02:02.669 --> 00:02:02.679 
you're trying to these guys have to not

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:04.630 
you're trying to these guys have to not
allow<00:02:02.889> the<00:02:02.919> ball<00:02:03.279> through<00:02:03.609> these

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640 
allow the ball through these

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.700 
allow the ball through these
the<00:02:05.600> other<00:02:05.720> thing<00:02:05.960> that's<00:02:06.110> important<00:02:06.620> with

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:06.710 
the other thing that's important with

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:08.410 
the other thing that's important with
those<00:02:06.890> wing<00:02:07.130> strikers<00:02:07.700> is<00:02:07.880> that<00:02:08.060> they<00:02:08.240> don't

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420 
those wing strikers is that they don't

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:10.810 
those wing strikers is that they don't
drop<00:02:08.780> back<00:02:08.990> on<00:02:09.170> an<00:02:09.290> arrow<00:02:09.470> here<00:02:09.770> because<00:02:10.640> that

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:10.820 
drop back on an arrow here because that

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:12.790 
drop back on an arrow here because that
does<00:02:11.030> allow<00:02:11.210> the<00:02:11.390> ball<00:02:11.750> to<00:02:11.780> get<00:02:12.170> much<00:02:12.530> further

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 
does allow the ball to get much further

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.800 
does allow the ball to get much further
up<00:02:13.040> the<00:02:13.160> field<00:02:13.400> so<00:02:13.970> it's<00:02:14.120> important<00:02:14.600> that<00:02:14.630> they

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
up the field so it's important that they

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:17.140 
up the field so it's important that they
stay<00:02:14.870> in<00:02:15.500> when<00:02:16.400> it's<00:02:16.550> in<00:02:16.670> the<00:02:16.760> middle<00:02:17.000> of<00:02:17.060> the

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
stay in when it's in the middle of the

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.140 
stay in when it's in the middle of the
field<00:02:17.360> in<00:02:17.750> a<00:02:17.810> straight<00:02:18.110> line<00:02:18.140> or<00:02:18.980> along<00:02:19.940> those

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
field in a straight line or along those

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:26.130 
field in a straight line or along those
principles<00:02:21.100> if<00:02:22.100> it's<00:02:22.310> about<00:02:22.550> fall<00:02:22.940> however

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.960 

the<00:02:27.140> central<00:02:27.560> striker<00:02:27.830> would<00:02:28.160> set<00:02:28.460> up<00:02:28.610> for

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
the central striker would set up for

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.590 
the central striker would set up for
word<00:02:29.210> of<00:02:29.390> this<00:02:29.690> defender<00:02:30.290> and<00:02:31.360> outside<00:02:32.360> the

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:32.600 
word of this defender and outside the

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.930 
word of this defender and outside the
line<00:02:32.810> of<00:02:33.020> this<00:02:33.140> defender<00:02:33.740> with<00:02:34.460> the<00:02:34.580> view<00:02:34.790> to

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940 
line of this defender with the view to

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:38.350 
line of this defender with the view to
keeping<00:02:35.300> the<00:02:35.390> ball<00:02:35.570> into<00:02:35.840> this<00:02:36.140> zone<00:02:36.410> and<00:02:37.360> what

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360 
keeping the ball into this zone and what

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:43.620 
keeping the ball into this zone and what
is<00:02:38.570> critical<00:02:40.180> is<00:02:41.180> that<00:02:42.080> that<00:02:42.470> central<00:02:42.920> striker

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:43.630 
is critical is that that central striker

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:48.400 
is critical is that that central striker
gets<00:02:44.630> out<00:02:44.930> and<00:02:45.400> blocks<00:02:46.400> the<00:02:46.790> ball<00:02:47.360> to<00:02:48.140> getting

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
gets out and blocks the ball to getting

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:51.370 
gets out and blocks the ball to getting
across<00:02:48.710> field<00:02:49.070> so<00:02:49.910> some<00:02:50.180> coaches<00:02:50.810> say<00:02:51.110> look

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:51.380 
across field so some coaches say look

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:54.430 
across field so some coaches say look
the<00:02:51.530> fastest<00:02:52.330> way<00:02:53.330> to<00:02:53.360> get<00:02:53.660> to<00:02:53.840> there<00:02:54.050> is<00:02:54.200> in<00:02:54.350> a

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 
the fastest way to get to there is in a

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.500 
the fastest way to get to there is in a
straight<00:02:54.710> line<00:02:54.740> but<00:02:55.250> when<00:02:55.790> you<00:02:55.910> do<00:02:56.120> that<00:02:56.150> the

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 
straight line but when you do that the

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:58.600 
straight line but when you do that the
ball<00:02:56.660> can<00:02:56.930> shift<00:02:57.200> by<00:02:57.860> the<00:02:57.920> time<00:02:58.190> you<00:02:58.310> get<00:02:58.430> there

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:58.610 
ball can shift by the time you get there

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:01.420 
ball can shift by the time you get there
so<00:02:58.760> the<00:02:58.880> key<00:02:59.060> is<00:02:59.210> to<00:02:59.360> get<00:02:59.450> around<00:02:59.600> and<00:03:00.250> hold<00:03:01.250> the

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430 
so the key is to get around and hold the

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:03.460 
so the key is to get around and hold the
ball<00:03:01.610> in<00:03:01.640> there<00:03:01.940> you're<00:03:02.120> not<00:03:02.300> you<00:03:03.020> are<00:03:03.170> not

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.470 
ball in there you're not you are not

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:06.370 
ball in there you're not you are not
trying<00:03:03.950> to<00:03:04.100> necessarily<00:03:04.340> make<00:03:05.120> a<00:03:05.180> tackle<00:03:05.690> this

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:06.380 
trying to necessarily make a tackle this

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:09.250 
trying to necessarily make a tackle this
central<00:03:06.830> strikers<00:03:07.280> job<00:03:07.610> is<00:03:07.970> to<00:03:08.390> deny<00:03:08.540> the<00:03:08.750> ball

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 
central strikers job is to deny the ball

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.770 
central strikers job is to deny the ball
getting<00:03:09.530> to<00:03:09.739> this<00:03:09.890> side<00:03:10.130> of<00:03:10.250> the<00:03:10.340> field<00:03:10.780> and

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:11.780 
getting to this side of the field and

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:13.990 
getting to this side of the field and
then<00:03:11.930> once<00:03:12.200> again<00:03:12.350> with<00:03:13.100> aggressive<00:03:13.430> running

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.000 
then once again with aggressive running

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.190 
then once again with aggressive running
once<00:03:14.209> that<00:03:14.420> happens<00:03:15.160> you<00:03:16.160> would<00:03:16.310> have<00:03:17.200> players

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.200 
once that happens you would have players

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:21.070 
once that happens you would have players
set<00:03:18.650> up<00:03:18.830> around<00:03:19.280> based<00:03:20.209> on<00:03:20.480> where<00:03:20.690> that<00:03:20.870> play

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:21.080 
set up around based on where that play

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:24.130 
set up around based on where that play
sets<00:03:21.470> up<00:03:21.650> so<00:03:21.830> once<00:03:22.040> again<00:03:22.190> deny<00:03:23.180> this<00:03:23.239> pass<00:03:23.750> if

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:24.140 
sets up so once again deny this pass if

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:27.580 
sets up so once again deny this pass if
we've<00:03:24.950> got<00:03:25.130> a<00:03:25.160> an<00:03:25.640> opposition<00:03:26.209> player<00:03:26.360> here<00:03:26.900> we

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:27.590 
we've got a an opposition player here we

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:30.040 
we've got a an opposition player here we
front<00:03:27.950> mark<00:03:28.220> so<00:03:29.000> we're<00:03:29.180> going<00:03:29.360> that<00:03:29.630> way

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:30.050 
front mark so we're going that way

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:32.530 
front mark so we're going that way
we<00:03:30.590> don't<00:03:30.860> sign<00:03:31.400> off<00:03:31.670> down<00:03:31.940> here<00:03:31.970> because<00:03:32.420> that

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:32.540 
we don't sign off down here because that

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:35.440 
we don't sign off down here because that
pass<00:03:32.840> is<00:03:33.140> on<00:03:33.350> so<00:03:34.160> we<00:03:34.310> deny<00:03:34.670> that<00:03:34.700> person

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:35.450 
pass is on so we deny that person

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:38.080 
pass is on so we deny that person
getting<00:03:35.630> the<00:03:35.750> ball<00:03:36.050> and<00:03:36.519> same<00:03:37.519> thing<00:03:37.550> across

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.090 
getting the ball and same thing across

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:41.830 
getting the ball and same thing across
here<00:03:38.890> we<00:03:39.890> maintain<00:03:40.430> the<00:03:40.610> distance<00:03:41.060> in<00:03:41.300> the

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:41.840 
here we maintain the distance in the

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:46.449 
here we maintain the distance in the
lines<00:03:42.700> if<00:03:44.019> we<00:03:45.019> split<00:03:45.230> the<00:03:45.470> field<00:03:45.709> in<00:03:45.890> half<00:03:46.100> in

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:46.459 
lines if we split the field in half in

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:50.229 
lines if we split the field in half in
width<00:03:47.560> this<00:03:48.560> is<00:03:48.739> this<00:03:49.130> is<00:03:49.310> ball<00:03:49.550> side<00:03:49.910> this<00:03:50.180> is

00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:50.239 
width this is this is ball side this is

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:53.910 
width this is this is ball side this is
help<00:03:50.630> side<00:03:50.950> it's<00:03:51.950> important<00:03:52.519> that<00:03:52.760> people

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:53.920 
help side it's important that people

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:59.860 
help side it's important that people
head<00:03:54.920> towards<00:03:55.989> ball<00:03:56.989> side<00:03:57.380> to<00:03:57.850> compress<00:03:58.870> this

00:03:59.860 --> 00:03:59.870 
head towards ball side to compress this

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:02.410 
head towards ball side to compress this
order<00:04:00.860> of<00:04:00.890> the<00:04:01.130> field<00:04:01.400> or<00:04:01.610> or<00:04:01.820> eight<00:04:02.060> of<00:04:02.300> the

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:02.420 
order of the field or or eight of the

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:03.770 
order of the field or or eight of the
pitch<00:04:02.630> if<00:04:02.840> it's<00:04:02.989> in<00:04:03.140> this

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
pitch if it's in this

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.800 
pitch if it's in this
so<00:04:04.590> we<00:04:04.800> actually<00:04:04.920> maximize<00:04:05.700> bodies<00:04:06.540> in<00:04:06.720> this

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
so we actually maximize bodies in this

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:09.500 
so we actually maximize bodies in this
area<00:04:07.260> which<00:04:07.830> assists<00:04:08.310> in<00:04:08.400> denying<00:04:08.730> all<00:04:08.970> passes

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.510 
area which assists in denying all passes

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:11.780 
area which assists in denying all passes
it's<00:04:10.260> very<00:04:10.470> important<00:04:10.950> that<00:04:10.980> if<00:04:11.310> there's<00:04:11.670> us

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790 
it's very important that if there's us

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:14.690 
it's very important that if there's us
they<00:04:12.690> have<00:04:12.870> a<00:04:12.900> striker<00:04:13.319> up<00:04:13.590> here<00:04:13.830> that<00:04:14.519> our

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 
they have a striker up here that our

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:17.840 
they have a striker up here that our
fallback<00:04:14.970> isn't<00:04:15.919> gold<00:04:16.919> side<00:04:17.220> but<00:04:17.459> we<00:04:17.579> once

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:17.850 
fallback isn't gold side but we once

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:20.479 
fallback isn't gold side but we once
again<00:04:18.320> everybody<00:04:19.320> has<00:04:19.530> the<00:04:19.709> front<00:04:19.889> mark<00:04:20.220> and

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
again everybody has the front mark and

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:23.900 
again everybody has the front mark and
denial<00:04:20.940> passes<00:04:21.450> and<00:04:21.630> we<00:04:22.169> want<00:04:22.800> this<00:04:23.639> guy<00:04:23.760> to

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:23.910 
denial passes and we want this guy to

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:25.640 
denial passes and we want this guy to
drop<00:04:24.270> back<00:04:24.450> when<00:04:24.660> we<00:04:24.750> want<00:04:24.960> to<00:04:25.080> force<00:04:25.320> the<00:04:25.500> ball

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:25.650 
drop back when we want to force the ball

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:30.440 
drop back when we want to force the ball
into<00:04:26.010> this<00:04:26.130> area<00:04:28.520> obviously<00:04:29.520> win<00:04:30.090> the<00:04:30.210> balls

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:30.450 
into this area obviously win the balls

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:32.719 
into this area obviously win the balls
around<00:04:31.020> the<00:04:31.440> top<00:04:31.620> of<00:04:31.650> the<00:04:31.800> circle<00:04:32.040> it's<00:04:32.340> not<00:04:32.550> as

00:04:32.719 --> 00:04:32.729 
around the top of the circle it's not as

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:36.110 
around the top of the circle it's not as
easy<00:04:32.790> to<00:04:33.479> fall<00:04:33.720> press<00:04:34.430> when<00:04:35.430> the<00:04:35.580> balls<00:04:35.790> in

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:36.120 
easy to fall press when the balls in

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:39.710 
easy to fall press when the balls in
this<00:04:36.389> zone<00:04:37.400> or<00:04:38.400> this<00:04:38.639> zone<00:04:38.940> is<00:04:39.120> a<00:04:39.150> starting

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:39.720 
this zone or this zone is a starting

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:42.920 
this zone or this zone is a starting
point<00:04:39.960> obviously<00:04:40.919> we<00:04:41.460> consider<00:04:42.000> much<00:04:42.600> more

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:42.930 
point obviously we consider much more

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:48.530 
point obviously we consider much more
aggressively<00:04:46.370> without<00:04:47.370> let's<00:04:48.150> strike<00:04:48.510> a

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:48.540 
aggressively without let's strike a

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:51.530 
aggressively without let's strike a
central<00:04:49.320> striker<00:04:49.620> and<00:04:50.070> what<00:04:50.669> our<00:04:51.120> right

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:51.540 
central striker and what our right

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:55.430 
central striker and what our right
striker<00:04:51.990> has<00:04:52.260> to<00:04:52.410> do<00:04:52.610> is<00:04:53.610> deny<00:04:54.419> that<00:04:54.870> passed

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:55.440 
striker has to do is deny that passed

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:58.280 
striker has to do is deny that passed
through<00:04:55.800> there<00:04:56.570> so<00:04:57.570> we<00:04:57.720> can't<00:04:57.960> have<00:04:58.139> this

00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:58.290 
through there so we can't have this

00:04:58.290 --> 00:04:59.900 
through there so we can't have this
right<00:04:58.530> striker<00:04:58.979> coming<00:04:59.400> up<00:04:59.520> and<00:04:59.700> over

00:04:59.900 --> 00:04:59.910 
right striker coming up and over

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:02.980 
right striker coming up and over
committing<00:05:00.330> up<00:05:00.450> here<00:05:00.750> he<00:05:01.440> has<00:05:01.710> to<00:05:01.919> protect

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:02.990 
committing up here he has to protect

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:05.870 
committing up here he has to protect
through<00:05:03.990> the<00:05:04.139> V<00:05:04.350> of<00:05:04.560> that<00:05:04.740> formation<00:05:05.430> and<00:05:05.610> he

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:05.880 
through the V of that formation and he

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:08.690 
through the V of that formation and he
sets<00:05:06.180> up<00:05:06.360> first<00:05:06.630> then<00:05:07.350> this<00:05:07.620> one<00:05:07.860> then<00:05:08.550> this

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:08.700 
sets up first then this one then this

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:11.420 
sets up first then this one then this
one<00:05:09.080> that<00:05:10.080> one's<00:05:10.260> the<00:05:10.380> eyes<00:05:10.620> at<00:05:10.860> the<00:05:10.979> back<00:05:11.190> and

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:11.430 
one that one's the eyes at the back and

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:13.580 
one that one's the eyes at the back and
has<00:05:12.120> to<00:05:12.300> fill<00:05:12.510> that<00:05:12.690> gap

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:13.590 
has to fill that gap

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:16.520 
has to fill that gap
well<00:05:14.550> that's<00:05:14.789> happening<00:05:15.240> you<00:05:16.200> would<00:05:16.350> have

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:16.530 
well that's happening you would have

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:19.940 
well that's happening you would have
other<00:05:17.010> bodies<00:05:17.550> doing<00:05:17.820> their<00:05:18.120> job<00:05:18.389> and<00:05:18.800> as<00:05:19.800> I

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:19.950 
other bodies doing their job and as I

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:22.940 
other bodies doing their job and as I
said<00:05:20.570> there<00:05:21.570> has<00:05:21.840> to<00:05:21.870> be<00:05:22.020> some<00:05:22.350> relationship

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:22.950 
said there has to be some relationship

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:26.000 
said there has to be some relationship
that's<00:05:23.669> maintained<00:05:24.419> and<00:05:24.690> that<00:05:24.870> we<00:05:24.990> don't<00:05:25.229> get

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:26.010 
that's maintained and that we don't get

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:30.020 
that's maintained and that we don't get
too<00:05:26.220> many<00:05:26.370> up<00:05:26.880> in<00:05:27.150> that<00:05:27.300> front<00:05:27.600> line<00:05:27.780> a<00:05:29.030> couple

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:30.030 
too many up in that front line a couple

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:32.029 
too many up in that front line a couple
of<00:05:30.240> the<00:05:30.330> keys<00:05:30.600> obviously<00:05:31.380> aggressing<00:05:31.830> run

00:05:32.029 --> 00:05:32.039 
of the keys obviously aggressing run

00:05:32.039 --> 00:05:34.040 
of the keys obviously aggressing run
aggressive<00:05:32.580> running<00:05:32.970> is<00:05:33.150> the<00:05:33.419> key<00:05:33.630> the

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:34.050 
aggressive running is the key the

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:36.230 
aggressive running is the key the
biggest<00:05:34.410> key<00:05:34.620> that<00:05:35.400> if<00:05:35.700> you<00:05:35.820> do<00:05:35.970> the<00:05:36.090> work

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:36.240 
biggest key that if you do the work

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:38.840 
biggest key that if you do the work
early<00:05:36.720> then<00:05:36.960> it's<00:05:37.770> half<00:05:38.190> the<00:05:38.280> battle<00:05:38.669> and

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:38.850 
early then it's half the battle and

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:40.909 
early then it's half the battle and
that's<00:05:39.389> done<00:05:39.990> by<00:05:40.020> the<00:05:40.229> central<00:05:40.650> striker

00:05:40.909 --> 00:05:40.919 
that's done by the central striker

00:05:40.919 --> 00:05:46.129 
that's done by the central striker
primarily<00:05:42.440> and<00:05:43.440> as<00:05:44.400> I<00:05:44.550> said<00:05:44.610> don't<00:05:45.240> the<00:05:45.870> key<00:05:46.080> is

00:05:46.129 --> 00:05:46.139 
primarily and as I said don't the key is

00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:47.900 
primarily and as I said don't the key is
not<00:05:46.440> necessarily<00:05:46.860> to<00:05:47.099> make<00:05:47.250> a<00:05:47.280> tackle<00:05:47.580> it's

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:47.910 
not necessarily to make a tackle it's

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:50.070 
not necessarily to make a tackle it's
just<00:05:48.120> to<00:05:48.240> force<00:05:48.479> an<00:05:48.660> error<00:05:48.840> or<00:05:49.289> two<00:05:49.470> or<00:05:49.710> two

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:50.080 
just to force an error or two or two

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:51.390 
just to force an error or two or two
come<00:05:50.169> up<00:05:50.289> with<00:05:50.439> an<00:05:50.560> interception<00:05:50.979> but<00:05:51.250> it

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:51.400 
come up with an interception but it

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:53.429 
come up with an interception but it
doesn't<00:05:51.699> have<00:05:51.789> to<00:05:51.879> be<00:05:52.000> on<00:05:52.120> the<00:05:52.210> first<00:05:52.449> plane<00:05:52.720> so

00:05:53.429 --> 00:05:53.439 
doesn't have to be on the first plane so

00:05:53.439 --> 00:05:55.559 
doesn't have to be on the first plane so
be<00:05:53.620> patient<00:05:53.860> with<00:05:54.159> it<00:05:54.310> as<00:05:54.550> a<00:05:54.610> group<00:05:55.030> we<00:05:55.240> need<00:05:55.270> to

00:05:55.559 --> 00:05:55.569 
be patient with it as a group we need to

00:05:55.569 --> 00:05:58.890 
be patient with it as a group we need to
put<00:05:56.409> a<00:05:57.099> large<00:05:57.879> amount<00:05:58.240> of<00:05:58.300> pressure<00:05:58.569> and

00:05:58.890 --> 00:05:58.900 
put a large amount of pressure and

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:01.290 
put a large amount of pressure and
enforce<00:05:59.590> eterno<00:06:00.009> that's<00:06:00.340> the<00:06:00.520> focus<00:06:00.879> but<00:06:01.120> if

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:01.300 
enforce eterno that's the focus but if

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:03.149 
enforce eterno that's the focus but if
we<00:06:01.719> try<00:06:01.960> and<00:06:02.080> remember<00:06:02.319> the<00:06:02.530> principles<00:06:03.009> of

00:06:03.149 --> 00:06:03.159 
we try and remember the principles of

00:06:03.159 --> 00:06:06.659 
we try and remember the principles of
denial<00:06:03.699> passes<00:06:04.800> central<00:06:05.800> striker<00:06:06.069> sets<00:06:06.460> the

00:06:06.659 --> 00:06:06.669 
denial passes central striker sets the

00:06:06.669 --> 00:06:10.050 
denial passes central striker sets the
press<00:06:07.110> if<00:06:08.110> we're<00:06:08.500> if<00:06:08.919> we<00:06:09.099> you<00:06:09.669> know<00:06:09.759> field

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:10.060 
press if we're if we you know field

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:13.200 
press if we're if we you know field
position<00:06:10.569> is<00:06:10.689> also<00:06:10.900> critical<00:06:11.500> so<00:06:11.849> we<00:06:12.849> need<00:06:13.090> to

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:13.210 
position is also critical so we need to

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:15.929 
position is also critical so we need to
be<00:06:13.330> forward<00:06:13.780> of<00:06:13.900> this<00:06:14.080> this<00:06:15.039> one<00:06:15.310> we<00:06:15.699> need<00:06:15.879> to

00:06:15.929 --> 00:06:15.939 
be forward of this this one we need to

00:06:15.939 --> 00:06:18.839 
be forward of this this one we need to
be<00:06:16.060> on<00:06:17.020> top<00:06:17.379> side<00:06:17.680> of<00:06:17.860> this<00:06:17.979> one<00:06:18.189> if<00:06:18.460> we<00:06:18.580> want<00:06:18.789> to

00:06:18.839 --> 00:06:18.849 
be on top side of this one if we want to

00:06:18.849 --> 00:06:20.969 
be on top side of this one if we want to
hold<00:06:19.000> it<00:06:19.150> in<00:06:19.270> on<00:06:19.539> the<00:06:19.750> ball<00:06:19.870> side<00:06:20.110> so<00:06:20.680> a<00:06:20.740> couple

00:06:20.969 --> 00:06:20.979 
hold it in on the ball side so a couple

00:06:20.979 --> 00:06:28.200 
hold it in on the ball side so a couple
of<00:06:21.210> main<00:06:22.210> things<00:06:22.509> there<00:06:25.740> obviously<00:06:27.090> yeah<00:06:28.090> if

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:28.210 
of main things there obviously yeah if

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:30.869 
of main things there obviously yeah if
the<00:06:28.330> ball<00:06:28.509> gets<00:06:28.690> into<00:06:28.870> these<00:06:29.199> hot<00:06:29.469> zones<00:06:29.879> don't

00:06:30.869 --> 00:06:30.879 
the ball gets into these hot zones don't

00:06:30.879 --> 00:06:32.760 
the ball gets into these hot zones don't
give<00:06:31.060> away<00:06:31.300> a<00:06:31.330> free<00:06:31.599> hit<00:06:31.900> you've<00:06:32.319> done<00:06:32.530> all<00:06:32.650> the

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:32.770 
give away a free hit you've done all the

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:34.439 
give away a free hit you've done all the
hard<00:06:32.889> work<00:06:33.159> in<00:06:33.340> getting<00:06:33.370> the<00:06:33.789> ball<00:06:34.000> there<00:06:34.240> and

00:06:34.439 --> 00:06:34.449 
hard work in getting the ball there and

00:06:34.449 --> 00:06:36.300 
hard work in getting the ball there and
the<00:06:34.990> focus<00:06:35.349> is<00:06:35.500> to<00:06:35.530> try<00:06:35.800> and<00:06:35.949> hold<00:06:36.129> it<00:06:36.250> there

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:36.310 
the focus is to try and hold it there

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:39.689 
the focus is to try and hold it there
and<00:06:36.699> as<00:06:37.000> I<00:06:37.030> say<00:06:37.270> force<00:06:37.539> the<00:06:37.690> turnover<00:06:37.840> so<00:06:38.699> good

00:06:39.689 --> 00:06:39.699 
and as I say force the turnover so good

00:06:39.699 --> 00:06:41.519 
and as I say force the turnover so good
luck<00:06:39.849> with<00:06:39.909> your<00:06:40.210> pressing<00:06:40.690> this<00:06:41.169> in

press<00:06:44.009> very<00:06:45.009> quickly<00:06:45.310> I<00:06:45.669> guess<00:06:46.330> if<00:06:46.629> the<00:06:46.900> ball

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:47.080 
press very quickly I guess if the ball

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:50.969 
press very quickly I guess if the ball
is<00:06:47.379> in<00:06:48.069> this<00:06:48.370> zone<00:06:48.689> by<00:06:49.689> defensive<00:06:50.349> side<00:06:50.590> and

00:06:50.969 --> 00:06:50.979

00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:53.860 
the coach of the other press that we do

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:55.700 
the coach of the other press that we do
do<00:06:54.009> in<00:06:54.129> Australia<00:06:54.520> is<00:06:54.580> the<00:06:54.639> 4-way<00:06:55.120> press<00:06:55.449> and

00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:55.710 
do in Australia is the 4-way press and

00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:58.559 
do in Australia is the 4-way press and
basically<00:06:56.710> it<00:06:56.830> just<00:06:56.860> means<00:06:57.310> that<00:06:57.610> everybody

00:06:58.559 --> 00:06:58.569
