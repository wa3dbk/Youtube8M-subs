00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:38.350 
drawing and the idea then is that

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:40.539 
drawing and the idea then is that
drawing<00:01:39.350> is<00:01:39.560> not<00:01:39.590> something<00:01:40.220> that<00:01:40.250> you<00:01:40.400> can

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:40.549 
drawing is not something that you can

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:43.359 
drawing is not something that you can

medium we talk about the line it's about

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.609 
medium we talk about the line it's about

contrast of light and dark

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:52.929

it's<00:01:49.310> to<00:01:50.299> understand<00:01:51.100> that<00:01:52.100> drawing<00:01:52.700> is

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:52.939 
it's to understand that drawing is

it's to understand that drawing is
something<00:01:53.090> that<00:01:53.450> has<00:01:53.570> to<00:01:53.659> do<00:01:53.780> with<00:01:53.869> an

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:53.990 
something that has to do with an

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:56.319 
something that has to do with an

artistic attitude it has to do with a

antistick concept that the idea you

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.950 
antistick concept that the idea you
produce<00:01:59.240> a<00:01:59.479> drawing<00:02:00.100> as<00:02:01.100> a<00:02:01.340> conceptual

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:01.960 
produce a drawing as a conceptual

artwork that drawing is a very

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.999 
artwork that drawing is a very
conceptual<00:02:05.180> form<00:02:05.509> of<00:02:05.630> art<00:02:05.869> and<00:02:06.200> that<00:02:06.799> when

close to concept art work as a concept
short<00:02:14.220> very<00:02:14.819> close<00:02:15.120> to<00:02:15.300> their<00:02:15.450> artistic<00:02:15.989> idea

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470

then define the medium of drawing that

then define the medium of drawing that

and<00:06:22.999> it's<00:06:23.839> conceptually<00:06:24.409> very<00:06:24.589> interesting

00:06:25.119 --> 00:06:25.129 
and it's conceptually very interesting

00:06:25.129 --> 00:06:26.589 
and it's conceptually very interesting
because<00:06:25.249> they<00:06:25.490> have<00:06:25.519> a<00:06:25.610> result<00:06:25.999> that<00:06:26.240> could<00:06:26.449> be

00:06:26.589 --> 00:06:26.599 
because they have a result that could be

00:06:26.599 --> 00:06:29.109 
because they have a result that could be
a<00:06:26.629> real-life<00:06:27.050> object<00:06:27.619> or<00:06:28.459> it<00:06:28.729> could<00:06:28.939> be<00:06:29.089> a

00:06:29.109 --> 00:06:29.119 
a real-life object or it could be a

00:06:29.119 --> 00:06:30.850 
a real-life object or it could be a
concrete<00:06:29.569> art<00:06:29.869> because<00:06:30.499> it's<00:06:30.649> self

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:30.860 
concrete art because it's self

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:32.529 
concrete art because it's self
referential<00:06:31.309> or<00:06:31.579> it<00:06:31.699> could<00:06:31.819> be<00:06:31.909> abstract<00:06:32.360> art

referential or it could be abstract art

00:06:32.539 --> 00:06:34.659 
referential or it could be abstract art
because<00:06:33.259> it<00:06:33.379> does<00:06:33.619> represent<00:06:33.829> something<00:06:34.399> in

00:06:34.659 --> 00:06:34.669 
because it does represent something in

00:06:34.669 --> 00:06:36.189 
because it does represent something in
the<00:06:34.759> world<00:06:34.939> but<00:06:35.389> you<00:06:35.479> don't<00:06:35.659> know<00:06:35.869> what<00:06:35.990> it<00:06:36.079> is

00:06:36.189 --> 00:06:36.199 
the world but you don't know what it is

the world but you don't know what it is
and<00:06:36.499> it's<00:06:36.829> very<00:06:37.159> unclear<00:06:37.519> what<00:06:37.759> it<00:06:37.849> is<00:06:37.999> and

00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:38.300 
and it's very unclear what it is and

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:40.659 
and it's very unclear what it is and
this<00:06:38.629> is<00:06:38.779> something<00:06:39.019> that's<00:06:39.229> very<00:06:39.529> new<00:06:39.800> in<00:06:40.309> art

00:06:40.659 --> 00:06:40.669 
this is something that's very new in art

00:06:40.669 --> 00:06:43.440 
this is something that's very new in art
and<00:06:41.029> that<00:06:41.749> is<00:06:41.809> pushing<00:06:42.229> the<00:06:42.469> limits<00:06:42.499> of<00:06:42.949> our

and that is pushing the limits of our
further<00:06:44.350> than<00:06:44.590> where<00:06:45.400> they<00:06:45.520> were<00:06:45.550> before

art<00:07:08.760> and<00:07:09.090> music<00:07:09.270> well<00:07:09.600> they're<00:07:09.690> obviously<00:07:10.170> art

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:10.410 
art and music well they're obviously art

00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:12.230 
art and music well they're obviously art
and<00:07:10.620> they're<00:07:10.710> obviously<00:07:11.070> drawings<00:07:11.520> but<00:07:12.090> you

00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:12.240 
and they're obviously drawings but you

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:14.060 
and they're obviously drawings but you
can<00:07:12.390> almost<00:07:12.570> read<00:07:12.990> them<00:07:13.170> like<00:07:13.320> musical<00:07:13.770> scores

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:14.070 
can almost read them like musical scores

00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:17.180 
can almost read them like musical scores
and<00:07:14.430> when<00:07:15.300> you<00:07:15.420> look<00:07:15.600> at<00:07:15.720> them<00:07:15.900> you<00:07:16.560> do<00:07:16.800> think

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:17.190 
and when you look at them you do think

00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:20.720 
and when you look at them you do think
that<00:07:17.520> they<00:07:18.420> might<00:07:18.810> actually<00:07:19.290> be<00:07:19.830> music

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:20.730

00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:38.150 
inspired by John Cage when she did the
words<00:07:35.720> and<00:07:36.720> when<00:07:37.380> you<00:07:37.470> look<00:07:37.620> at<00:07:37.710> the<00:07:37.800> lines<00:07:37.980> you

00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:38.160 
words and when you look at the lines you

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:40.310 
words and when you look at the lines you
see<00:07:38.190> that<00:07:38.460> they<00:07:38.610> they<00:07:38.880> fight<00:07:39.180> each<00:07:39.330> other<00:07:39.510> that

00:07:40.310 --> 00:07:40.320 
see that they they fight each other that

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:42.470 
see that they they fight each other that
there<00:07:40.800> is<00:07:40.920> a<00:07:40.950> lot<00:07:41.190> of<00:07:41.340> friction<00:07:41.700> in<00:07:42.150> between

00:07:42.470 --> 00:07:42.480 
there is a lot of friction in between

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:42.890 
there is a lot of friction in between
them

00:07:42.890 --> 00:07:42.900 
them

00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:44.930

so<00:07:43.380> those<00:07:43.560> are<00:07:43.770> artworks<00:07:44.250> that<00:07:44.340> are<00:07:44.550> even

00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:44.940 
so those are artworks that are even

00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:47.120 
so those are artworks that are even
though<00:07:45.060> they're<00:07:45.240> highly<00:07:45.570> conceptual<00:07:46.130> they

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:47.130

though they're highly conceptual they
develop<00:07:47.580> on<00:07:47.790> the<00:07:47.940> sheet<00:07:48.090> of<00:07:48.240> paper<00:07:48.270> so<00:07:48.780> it's

00:07:48.890 --> 00:07:48.900 
develop on the sheet of paper so it's

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:51.560 
develop on the sheet of paper so it's
thinking<00:07:49.530> with<00:07:49.770> the<00:07:49.830> hand<00:07:50.070> thinking<00:07:50.760> on<00:07:51.210> paper

that she exercises with her works they

that she exercises with her works they
develop<00:07:54.660> and<00:07:54.870> they<00:07:55.020> are<00:07:55.140> only<00:07:55.350> partly

00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:55.770
