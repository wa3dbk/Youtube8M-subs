00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:19.199 
championship it's very very important I
think<00:02:15.760> it's<00:02:15.940> the<00:02:16.380> most<00:02:17.380> credible<00:02:18.209> activity

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:19.209 
think it's the most credible activity

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:22.650 
think it's the most credible activity
that<00:02:19.510> you<00:02:19.540> could<00:02:19.900> show<00:02:20.440> to<00:02:20.500> a<00:02:20.830> potential<00:02:21.670> road

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
that you could show to a potential road

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:25.050 
that you could show to a potential road
car<00:02:22.989> buyer<00:02:23.319> that<00:02:23.770> the<00:02:24.190> technology<00:02:24.790> and<00:02:24.850> that

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060

it's<00:02:27.970> good<00:02:28.180> for<00:02:28.420> a<00:02:28.450> race<00:02:28.630> car<00:02:28.900> it's<00:02:29.080> good<00:02:29.260> for

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
it's good for a race car it's good for

500 I think it's it's always important

500 I think it's it's always important
that<00:03:55.499> you<00:03:55.650> know<00:03:55.799> where<00:03:56.129> your<00:03:56.340> roots<00:03:56.670> come<00:03:56.969> from
