00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
maybe you know I do think that this is a

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:43.670

difficult<00:03:44.280> one<00:03:44.849> I<00:03:45.090> think<00:03:45.450> to<00:03:45.569> come<00:03:45.810> across

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
difficult one I think to come across

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:48.500 
difficult one I think to come across
with<00:03:46.890> the<00:03:46.980> style<00:03:47.310> that<00:03:47.400> you<00:03:47.670> guys<00:03:47.879> do<00:03:48.269> it<00:03:48.420> in

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
with the style that you guys do it in

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:50.330 
with the style that you guys do it in
which<00:03:49.019> by<00:03:49.230> the<00:03:49.290> way<00:03:49.410> I<00:03:49.530> do<00:03:49.680> think<00:03:49.980> your<00:03:50.099> style

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
which by the way I do think your style

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:52.520 
which by the way I do think your style
is<00:03:50.580> is<00:03:50.910> fantastic<00:03:51.720> and<00:03:51.840> it<00:03:51.900> actually<00:03:52.019> makes<00:03:52.319> me

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
is is fantastic and it actually makes me

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:54.920 
is is fantastic and it actually makes me
smile<00:03:52.830> but<00:03:53.010> I'm<00:03:53.129> not<00:03:53.310> sure<00:03:53.700> it<00:03:54.180> worked<00:03:54.720> for

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
smile but I'm not sure it worked for

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:57.500 
smile but I'm not sure it worked for
this<00:03:55.049> particular<00:03:55.410> song<00:03:55.920> I'm<00:03:56.849> sorry<00:03:57.150> to<00:03:57.360> say
