00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
when you've done you just flip the lever

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.569 
when you've done you just flip the lever
back<00:00:32.520> and<00:00:32.759> the<00:00:33.480> water<00:00:33.690> stops<00:00:34.340> that's<00:00:35.340> how<00:00:35.489> that

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
back and the water stops that's how that

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:36.400 
back and the water stops that's how that
works

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:36.410 
works

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:39.709 
works
alright<00:00:37.940> let's<00:00:38.940> get<00:00:39.149> to<00:00:39.300> it<00:00:39.329> then

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
alright let's get to it then

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.920 
alright let's get to it then
so<00:00:40.320> the<00:00:41.250> first<00:00:41.430> thing<00:00:41.579> we're<00:00:41.700> gonna<00:00:41.760> do<00:00:42.000> is<00:00:42.180> we

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
so the first thing we're gonna do is we

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.500 
so the first thing we're gonna do is we
are<00:00:43.050> going<00:00:43.200> to<00:00:43.320> build<00:00:43.620> the<00:00:44.309> mainframe<00:00:45.239> for

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
are going to build the mainframe for

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.680 
are going to build the mainframe for
their<00:00:46.260> machine<00:00:46.760> so<00:00:47.760> we're<00:00:48.059> gonna<00:00:48.149> do<00:00:48.300> is<00:00:48.480> we're

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
their machine so we're gonna do is we're

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.200 
their machine so we're gonna do is we're
gonna<00:00:48.750> do<00:00:48.960> where<00:00:49.170> one<00:00:49.680> by<00:00:50.100> three<00:00:50.489> so<00:00:51.149> that's

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
gonna do where one by three so that's

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.869 
gonna do where one by three so that's
one<00:00:51.449> block<00:00:51.570> by<00:00:51.809> three<00:00:52.050> wide<00:00:52.230> and<00:00:52.680> then<00:00:53.219> off<00:00:53.430> in

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
one block by three wide and then off in

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.209 
one block by three wide and then off in
block<00:00:54.239> we're<00:00:54.420> gonna<00:00:54.539> go<00:00:54.960> diagonal<00:00:55.500> like<00:00:55.980> that

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
block we're gonna go diagonal like that

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.330 
block we're gonna go diagonal like that
and<00:00:57.210> then<00:00:57.360> jump<00:00:58.170> down<00:00:58.230> and<00:00:58.649> we're<00:00:59.070> gonna<00:00:59.160> go

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
and then jump down and we're gonna go

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.910 
and then jump down and we're gonna go
from<00:00:59.699> that<00:00:59.879> block<00:01:00.180> we're<00:01:00.390> gonna<00:01:00.510> go<00:01:00.719> nine<00:01:01.079> more

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
from that block we're gonna go nine more

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.310 
from that block we're gonna go nine more
so<00:01:02.609> altogether<00:01:03.120> it'll<00:01:03.359> be<00:01:03.420> ten<00:01:03.690> in<00:01:03.989> a<00:01:04.019> straight

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
so altogether it'll be ten in a straight

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:04.929 
so altogether it'll be ten in a straight
line

00:01:04.929 --> 00:01:04.939 
line

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:07.160 
line
so<00:01:05.939> that's<00:01:06.090> on<00:01:06.180> that<00:01:06.299> side<00:01:06.360> it'll<00:01:06.869> do<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.140> same

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
so that's on that side it'll do the same

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.490 
so that's on that side it'll do the same
upon<00:01:07.619> the<00:01:07.710> other<00:01:07.830> side<00:01:08.330> so<00:01:09.330> that's<00:01:09.510> ten<00:01:09.810> and

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
upon the other side so that's ten and

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.030 
upon the other side so that's ten and
then<00:01:10.740> we<00:01:10.920> want<00:01:11.070> to<00:01:11.130> make<00:01:11.280> it<00:01:11.520> too<00:01:11.760> high<00:01:12.770> so<00:01:13.770> just

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
then we want to make it too high so just

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.130 
then we want to make it too high so just
do<00:01:14.130> another<00:01:14.340> layer<00:01:14.610> but<00:01:15.090> leave<00:01:15.270> one<00:01:15.840> block

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
do another layer but leave one block

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.060 
do another layer but leave one block
spare<00:01:16.560> either<00:01:18.200> so<00:01:19.200> you<00:01:19.290> leave<00:01:19.439> the<00:01:19.560> trough<00:01:19.830> bit

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
spare either so you leave the trough bit

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:27.910 
spare either so you leave the trough bit
and<00:01:21.030> then<00:01:21.119> do<00:01:21.299> the<00:01:21.390> same<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:21.780> other<00:01:21.810> side

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.530 

yeah<00:01:28.920> now<00:01:29.250> I<00:01:29.280> know<00:01:29.670> that's<00:01:29.909> done<00:01:30.180> we're<00:01:30.450> gonna

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
yeah now I know that's done we're gonna

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.210 
yeah now I know that's done we're gonna
make<00:01:31.530> the<00:01:31.770> back

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
make the back

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.039 
make the back
now<00:01:32.430> we're<00:01:32.700> gonna<00:01:32.820> for<00:01:33.060> the<00:01:33.119> back<00:01:33.299> as<00:01:33.840> you<00:01:33.930> can

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
now we're gonna for the back as you can

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.230 
now we're gonna for the back as you can
see<00:01:34.200> that<00:01:34.400> we're<00:01:35.400> gonna<00:01:35.490> come<00:01:35.729> out<00:01:35.820> another

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
see that we're gonna come out another

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.850 
see that we're gonna come out another
one<00:01:36.570> block<00:01:37.759> one<00:01:38.759> block<00:01:38.790> each<00:01:39.330> side<00:01:39.659> and<00:01:40.020> it

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
one block one block each side and it

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.780 
one block one block each side and it
needs<00:01:41.070> to<00:01:41.310> be<00:01:41.630> three<00:01:42.770> so<00:01:43.770> go<00:01:44.310> to<00:01:44.369> the<00:01:44.580> third

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
needs to be three so go to the third

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:50.450 
needs to be three so go to the third
block<00:01:45.000> in<00:01:45.240> there<00:01:45.930> and<00:01:46.880> build<00:01:47.880> it<00:01:48.030> too<00:01:48.539> high<00:01:49.460> so

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
block in there and build it too high so

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:55.100 
block in there and build it too high so
it's<00:01:51.030> going<00:01:51.240> to<00:01:51.330> be<00:01:51.710> three<00:01:52.710> wide<00:01:52.979> and<00:01:54.110> five

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
it's going to be three wide and five

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.639 
it's going to be three wide and five
across<00:01:55.500> right<00:01:56.460> now<00:01:56.520> and<00:01:57.030> then<00:01:57.810> build<00:01:58.229> another

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
across right now and then build another

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:01.550 
across right now and then build another
layer<00:01:58.860> on<00:01:58.950> so<00:01:59.310> that's<00:01:59.430> three<00:02:00.350> you<00:02:01.350> wanna<00:02:01.470> do

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
layer on so that's three you wanna do

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.790 
layer on so that's three you wanna do
this<00:02:01.649> all<00:02:01.830> the<00:02:01.950> way<00:02:02.039> around<00:02:03.500> and<00:02:04.500> you<00:02:04.590> jump

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:04.800 
this all the way around and you jump

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:09.139 
this all the way around and you jump
down<00:02:04.979> and<00:02:05.340> do<00:02:05.520> this<00:02:05.700> bit<00:02:07.009> but<00:02:08.009> that<00:02:08.190> bit<00:02:08.399> only

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
down and do this bit but that bit only

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.479 
down and do this bit but that bit only
needs<00:02:09.330> to<00:02:09.509> be<00:02:09.539> two<00:02:10.170> because<00:02:10.860> the<00:02:11.160> walls<00:02:11.370> gonna

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
needs to be two because the walls gonna

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.759 
needs to be two because the walls gonna

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
three each side so it makes that kind of

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.190 
three each side so it makes that kind of
shaped<00:02:32.040> like<00:02:32.070> an<00:02:32.250> oh<00:02:32.730> not<00:02:32.880> damned<00:02:33.200> so

got the power off sir

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:59.080 
got the power off sir
if<00:03:56.430> it<00:03:56.550> doesn't<00:03:56.730> work<00:03:56.850> one<00:03:57.000> way<00:03:57.150> or<00:03:57.210> the<00:03:57.450> other

see<00:04:05.910> that<00:04:06.170> redstone<00:04:07.170> repeaters<00:04:07.500> wrong<00:04:07.740> way

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:07.830 
see that redstone repeaters wrong way

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:09.440 
see that redstone repeaters wrong way
around<00:04:07.920> so<00:04:08.220> just<00:04:08.250> hook<00:04:08.910> it<00:04:09.030> around<00:04:09.060> the<00:04:09.300> right

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:09.450 
around so just hook it around the right

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:09.760 
around so just hook it around the right
way

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:09.770 
way

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:12.440
