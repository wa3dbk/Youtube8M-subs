working in industry today

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.640 
working in industry today
I<00:00:34.089> think<00:00:35.089> the<00:00:35.300> anime<00:00:35.629> industry<00:00:35.870> in<00:00:36.140> general<00:00:36.320> is

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:36.650 
I think the anime industry in general is

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:38.920 
I think the anime industry in general is
probably<00:00:36.829> struggling<00:00:37.640> as<00:00:37.879> evidenced<00:00:38.750> by<00:00:38.809> the

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:38.930 
probably struggling as evidenced by the

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:40.930 
probably struggling as evidenced by the
fact<00:00:39.050> that<00:00:39.290> we<00:00:39.710> are<00:00:39.949> kind<00:00:40.280> of<00:00:40.370> one<00:00:40.640> of<00:00:40.760> the<00:00:40.820> only

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:40.940 
fact that we are kind of one of the only

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:45.130 
fact that we are kind of one of the only
companies<00:00:41.150> left<00:00:41.839> around<00:00:42.550> and<00:00:43.719> but<00:00:44.719> I<00:00:44.750> do<00:00:44.930> think

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:45.140 
companies left around and but I do think

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:46.660 
companies left around and but I do think
that<00:00:45.320> it's<00:00:45.500> a<00:00:45.680> great<00:00:45.800> time<00:00:46.039> to<00:00:46.129> be<00:00:46.219> working<00:00:46.520> for

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:46.670 
that it's a great time to be working for

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:47.979 
that it's a great time to be working for
Funimation<00:00:47.180> they've<00:00:47.329> been<00:00:47.480> doing<00:00:47.600> an

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:47.989 
Funimation they've been doing an

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:50.650 
Funimation they've been doing an
excellent<00:00:48.230> job<00:00:48.800> of<00:00:49.510> rolling<00:00:50.510> with<00:00:50.600> the

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:50.660 
excellent job of rolling with the

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:52.420 
excellent job of rolling with the
punches<00:00:50.809> and<00:00:51.079> making<00:00:51.800> sure<00:00:51.949> that<00:00:52.070> piracy

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:52.430 
punches and making sure that piracy

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:55.450 
punches and making sure that piracy
doesn't<00:00:52.910> let<00:00:53.210> them<00:00:53.680> get<00:00:54.680> completely<00:00:55.219> sunk

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:55.460 
doesn't let them get completely sunk

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:58.060 
doesn't let them get completely sunk
under<00:00:55.840> and<00:00:56.840> they've<00:00:57.260> been<00:00:57.410> doing<00:00:57.530> good<00:00:57.829> with

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:58.070 
under and they've been doing good with

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:00.700 
under and they've been doing good with
social<00:00:58.430> media<00:00:58.699> and<00:00:59.260> finding<00:01:00.260> ways<00:01:00.379> to<00:01:00.410> get

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:00.710 
social media and finding ways to get

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:02.770 
social media and finding ways to get
content<00:01:01.100> online<00:01:01.550> and<00:01:01.730> get<00:01:01.820> content<00:01:02.179> to<00:01:02.420> people

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:02.780 
content online and get content to people

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:04.719 
content online and get content to people
before<00:01:03.320> they<00:01:03.739> would<00:01:03.859> be<00:01:04.009> able<00:01:04.190> to<00:01:04.280> pirate<00:01:04.610> it

00:01:04.719 --> 00:01:04.729 
before they would be able to pirate it

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:06.969 
before they would be able to pirate it
so<00:01:04.970> it<00:01:05.600> just<00:01:05.810> becomes<00:01:05.990> easier<00:01:06.440> for<00:01:06.679> them<00:01:06.770> to<00:01:06.890> go

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:06.979 
so it just becomes easier for them to go

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:09.249 
so it just becomes easier for them to go
through<00:01:07.190> Funimation<00:01:07.789> so<00:01:08.090> I<00:01:08.300> think<00:01:08.840> it's<00:01:09.140> a

00:01:09.249 --> 00:01:09.259 
through Funimation so I think it's a

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:11.169 
through Funimation so I think it's a
great<00:01:09.470> time<00:01:09.649> to<00:01:09.679> be<00:01:09.860> working<00:01:10.100> for<00:01:10.460> Funimation

00:01:11.169 --> 00:01:11.179 
great time to be working for Funimation

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:15.279 
great time to be working for Funimation
if<00:01:12.110> not<00:01:12.320> the<00:01:12.470> in<00:01:12.590> the<00:01:12.679> anime<00:01:13.039> industry<00:01:14.259> what<00:01:15.259> is

00:01:15.279 --> 00:01:15.289 
if not the in the anime industry what is

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:18.070 
if not the in the anime industry what is
the<00:01:15.590> favorite<00:01:16.069> anime<00:01:16.580> you've<00:01:16.789> worked<00:01:17.000> on<00:01:17.179> my

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:18.080 
the favorite anime you've worked on my

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.850 
the favorite anime you've worked on my
favorite<00:01:18.440> anime<00:01:18.770> I've<00:01:18.890> worked<00:01:19.099> on<00:01:19.220> is

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:20.860 
favorite anime I've worked on is

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:23.529 
favorite anime I've worked on is
probably<00:01:21.860> at<00:01:22.009> this<00:01:22.130> point<00:01:22.220> steins<00:01:22.789> gate<00:01:22.970> I

00:01:23.529 --> 00:01:23.539 
probably at this point steins gate I

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:25.809 
probably at this point steins gate I
directed<00:01:24.200> the<00:01:24.740> dub<00:01:24.890> of<00:01:25.039> steins<00:01:25.280> gate<00:01:25.429> and<00:01:25.759> I

00:01:25.809 --> 00:01:25.819 
directed the dub of steins gate and I

00:01:25.819 --> 00:01:29.020 
directed the dub of steins gate and I
think<00:01:26.030> that's<00:01:26.179> probably<00:01:26.599> my<00:01:27.050> favorite<00:01:28.030> anime
