00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:09.590 

now<00:00:08.010> there's<00:00:08.490> three<00:00:08.790> different<00:00:08.940> types<00:00:09.389> of

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:09.600 
now there's three different types of

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:11.480 
now there's three different types of
entries<00:00:09.960> in<00:00:10.110> the<00:00:10.230> holding<00:00:10.620> pattern<00:00:10.799> direct

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
entries in the holding pattern direct

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.759 
entries in the holding pattern direct
parallel<00:00:12.360> and<00:00:12.660> teardrop<00:00:13.230> and<00:00:13.260> we're<00:00:13.559> going<00:00:13.710> to

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
parallel and teardrop and we're going to

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.160 
parallel and teardrop and we're going to
talk<00:00:13.950> about<00:00:14.130> them<00:00:14.429> in<00:00:14.519> detail<00:00:14.760> the<00:00:15.599> type<00:00:15.900> of

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
talk about them in detail the type of

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.499 
talk about them in detail the type of
entry<00:00:16.560> you<00:00:16.740> make<00:00:16.980> is<00:00:17.250> actually<00:00:17.880> based<00:00:18.150> on

00:00:18.499 --> 00:00:18.509 
entry you make is actually based on

00:00:18.509 --> 00:00:20.780 
entry you make is actually based on
where<00:00:19.170> the<00:00:19.349> tail<00:00:19.680> of<00:00:19.950> the<00:00:20.070> aircraft<00:00:20.220> is

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:20.790 
where the tail of the aircraft is

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:23.179 
where the tail of the aircraft is
located<00:00:21.480> when<00:00:21.689> it<00:00:21.810> passes<00:00:22.349> over<00:00:22.619> the<00:00:22.770> holding

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
located when it passes over the holding

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.490 
located when it passes over the holding
fix<00:00:23.489> your<00:00:24.000> heading<00:00:24.390> will<00:00:24.660> affect<00:00:25.079> the<00:00:25.230> type<00:00:25.470> of

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
fix your heading will affect the type of

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.679 
fix your heading will affect the type of
entry<00:00:26.040> that<00:00:26.220> you<00:00:26.399> make<00:00:26.640> but<00:00:27.210> when<00:00:27.480> you're

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
entry that you make but when you're

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.839 
entry that you make but when you're
trying<00:00:27.930> to<00:00:28.050> figure<00:00:28.320> out<00:00:28.770> particularly<00:00:29.399> on<00:00:29.700> the

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
trying to figure out particularly on the

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.790 
trying to figure out particularly on the
test<00:00:30.149> what<00:00:30.540> kind<00:00:30.779> of<00:00:30.930> entry<00:00:31.230> to<00:00:31.349> make<00:00:31.559> in<00:00:31.739> a

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
test what kind of entry to make in a

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.580 
test what kind of entry to make in a
holding<00:00:32.189> pattern<00:00:32.720> forget<00:00:33.720> about<00:00:33.870> the<00:00:34.170> heading

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
holding pattern forget about the heading

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.009 
holding pattern forget about the heading
of<00:00:34.739> the<00:00:34.770> aircraft<00:00:35.340> to<00:00:35.489> begin<00:00:35.940> with<00:00:36.239> and<00:00:36.570> work

00:00:37.009 --> 00:00:37.019 
of the aircraft to begin with and work

00:00:37.019 --> 00:00:39.349 
of the aircraft to begin with and work
just<00:00:37.050> with<00:00:37.649> a<00:00:37.679> holding<00:00:38.160> pattern<00:00:38.370> because<00:00:39.210> the

00:00:39.349 --> 00:00:39.359 
just with a holding pattern because the

00:00:39.359 --> 00:00:41.509 
just with a holding pattern because the
easiest<00:00:39.780> way<00:00:40.109> to<00:00:40.140> do<00:00:40.469> it<00:00:40.620> is<00:00:40.829> to<00:00:41.010> take<00:00:41.250> that

00:00:41.509 --> 00:00:41.519 
easiest way to do it is to take that

00:00:41.519 --> 00:00:43.759 
easiest way to do it is to take that
holding<00:00:41.969> pattern<00:00:42.390> and<00:00:42.570> divide<00:00:43.230> it<00:00:43.440> up<00:00:43.589> into

00:00:43.759 --> 00:00:43.769 
holding pattern and divide it up into

00:00:43.769 --> 00:00:45.919 
holding pattern and divide it up into
the<00:00:44.039> three<00:00:44.370> different<00:00:44.820> types<00:00:45.059> of<00:00:45.300> entries<00:00:45.660> and

00:00:45.919 --> 00:00:45.929 
the three different types of entries and

00:00:45.929 --> 00:00:48.049 
the three different types of entries and
when<00:00:46.199> you're<00:00:46.379> done<00:00:46.530> dividing<00:00:47.070> it<00:00:47.250> up<00:00:47.399> then

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
when you're done dividing it up then

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.090 
when you're done dividing it up then
worry<00:00:48.780> about<00:00:49.109> where<00:00:49.379> the<00:00:49.530> airplane<00:00:49.949> is<00:00:50.070> coming

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
worry about where the airplane is coming

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.430 
worry about where the airplane is coming
from<00:00:50.699> and<00:00:51.059> how<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:51.570> hitting<00:00:51.929> is<00:00:52.109> going<00:00:52.320> to

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
from and how the hitting is going to

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.040 
from and how the hitting is going to
affect<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:52.980> entry<00:00:53.370> so<00:00:53.850> let's<00:00:54.179> divide<00:00:54.420> up<00:00:54.660> this

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
affect the entry so let's divide up this

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.899 
affect the entry so let's divide up this
holding<00:00:55.559> pattern<00:00:55.980> and<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.280> way<00:00:56.460> you<00:00:56.519> want<00:00:56.820> to

00:00:56.899 --> 00:00:56.909 
holding pattern and the way you want to

00:00:56.909 --> 00:01:00.020 
holding pattern and the way you want to
do<00:00:57.059> it<00:00:57.210> is<00:00:57.420> grab<00:00:57.870> your<00:00:57.899> pencil<00:00:58.859> just<00:00:59.550> like<00:00:59.760> my

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
do it is grab your pencil just like my

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.029 
do it is grab your pencil just like my
pencil<00:01:00.600> only<00:01:00.960> mine<00:01:01.170> may<00:01:01.379> be<00:01:01.440> a<00:01:01.589> little<00:01:01.890> bit

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
pencil only mine may be a little bit

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.610 
pencil only mine may be a little bit
bigger<00:01:02.370> and<00:01:02.699> more<00:01:02.879> massive<00:01:03.210> than<00:01:03.600> yours<00:01:03.929> take

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:04.620 
bigger and more massive than yours take

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:07.100 
bigger and more massive than yours take
your<00:01:04.830> pencil<00:01:05.070> and<00:01:05.309> put<00:01:06.090> it<00:01:06.240> down<00:01:06.480> on<00:01:06.900> the

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
your pencil and put it down on the

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.280 
your pencil and put it down on the
radial<00:01:07.560> that<00:01:07.770> forms<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.460> inbound<00:01:09.180> leg<00:01:09.689> put

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
radial that forms the inbound leg put

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.469 
radial that forms the inbound leg put
the<00:01:10.439> point<00:01:10.770> of<00:01:10.890> your<00:01:11.009> pencil<00:01:11.490> on<00:01:11.700> the<00:01:12.030> fix<00:01:12.270> and

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
the point of your pencil on the fix and

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.749 
the point of your pencil on the fix and
pretend<00:01:12.899> like<00:01:13.020> it's<00:01:13.320> hinged<00:01:13.649> there<00:01:14.159> and<00:01:14.369> the
