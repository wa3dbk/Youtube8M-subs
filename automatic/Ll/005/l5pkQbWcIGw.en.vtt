has<00:00:16.890> a<00:00:16.920> green<00:00:17.160> building<00:00:17.400> what<00:00:18.029> are<00:00:18.150> some

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
has a green building what are some

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.510 
has a green building what are some
examples<00:00:18.449> of<00:00:19.100> buildings<00:00:20.100> in<00:00:20.189> the<00:00:20.250> United

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
examples of buildings in the United

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.390 
examples of buildings in the United
States<00:00:20.760> that<00:00:20.910> are<00:00:21.060> doing<00:00:21.300> this<00:00:21.510> correctly

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:22.400 
States that are doing this correctly

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.550 
States that are doing this correctly
ever<00:00:23.400> this<00:00:23.789> is<00:00:24.210> really<00:00:24.570> a<00:00:24.600> growing<00:00:25.230> number<00:00:25.380> of

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
ever this is really a growing number of

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.099 
ever this is really a growing number of
examples<00:00:26.189> one<00:00:27.060> that<00:00:27.300> I<00:00:27.330> find<00:00:27.689> really

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
examples one that I find really

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.519 
examples one that I find really
fascinating<00:00:28.680> is<00:00:29.689> sort<00:00:30.689> of<00:00:30.720> a<00:00:30.840> Student<00:00:31.170> Center

it's very humid for and could be very
hot<00:00:37.410> at<00:00:37.680> some<00:00:38.070> time<00:00:38.309> during<00:00:39.000> the<00:00:39.390> the<00:00:39.950> during

hot at some time during the the during
the<00:00:41.070> season<00:00:41.399> so<00:00:41.579> what<00:00:41.910> they<00:00:42.059> did<00:00:42.120> is<00:00:42.530> to

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
the season so what they did is to

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.049 
the season so what they did is to
improve<00:00:44.460> the<00:00:45.000> people<00:00:45.329> comfort<00:00:46.050> is<00:00:46.230> to<00:00:47.059> move

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
improve the people comfort is to move

improve the people comfort is to move
the<00:00:48.270> air<00:00:48.450> about<00:00:48.899> the<00:00:49.260> sense<00:00:49.590> of<00:00:49.770> air<00:00:50.430> flowing

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
the air about the sense of air flowing

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.290 
the air about the sense of air flowing
on<00:00:51.449> when<00:00:51.750> skin<00:00:52.170> and<00:00:52.730> to<00:00:53.730> help<00:00:54.000> this

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
on when skin and to help this

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.170 
on when skin and to help this
evaporation<00:00:54.930> process<00:00:55.260> but<00:00:55.800> they<00:00:55.890> also<00:00:56.180> went

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
evaporation process but they also went

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.840 
evaporation process but they also went
to<00:00:57.300> remove<00:00:57.809> moisture<00:00:58.170> by<00:00:58.710> creating<00:00:59.430> some<00:00:59.640> kind

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
to remove moisture by creating some kind

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.760 
to remove moisture by creating some kind
of<00:00:59.940> water<00:01:00.149> walls<00:01:00.510> you<00:01:01.020> know<00:01:01.079> it's<00:01:01.500> a<00:01:01.590> tall

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
of water walls you know it's a tall

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.860 
of water walls you know it's a tall
space<00:01:02.070> which<00:01:02.340> is<00:01:02.520> good<00:01:02.699> for<00:01:02.910> you<00:01:03.449> know<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:03.719> air

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
space which is good for you know the air

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.109 
space which is good for you know the air
stratification<00:01:04.739> so<00:01:04.890> this<00:01:05.040> there's<00:01:05.640> people<00:01:05.820> in

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
stratification so this there's people in

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.570 
stratification so this there's people in
that<00:01:06.570> layer<00:01:06.810> at<00:01:07.320> that<00:01:07.500> level<00:01:07.680> you<00:01:08.250> see<00:01:08.430> the

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
that layer at that level you see the

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.740 
that layer at that level you see the
outside<00:01:09.619> they<00:01:10.619> worked<00:01:11.159> on<00:01:11.340> some<00:01:11.720> you<00:01:12.720> know

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
outside they worked on some you know

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.200 
outside they worked on some you know
shading<00:01:13.229> device<00:01:13.530> on<00:01:14.159> the<00:01:14.340> outside<00:01:14.670> to<00:01:14.850> make

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
shading device on the outside to make

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.390 
shading device on the outside to make
sure<00:01:15.420> that<00:01:15.630> the<00:01:15.900> Sun<00:01:16.110> is<00:01:16.290> is<00:01:16.560> not<00:01:16.799> penetrating

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
sure that the Sun is is not penetrating

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.600 
sure that the Sun is is not penetrating
to<00:01:17.580> to<00:01:18.150> massively<00:01:18.509> um<00:01:19.110> the<00:01:19.770> instead<00:01:20.280> of<00:01:20.310> they

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
to to massively um the instead of they

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.520 
to to massively um the instead of they
could<00:01:20.790> have<00:01:20.909> used<00:01:21.150> you<00:01:21.420> know<00:01:21.540> the<00:01:21.720> regular<00:01:22.049> fan

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
could have used you know the regular fan

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.210 
could have used you know the regular fan
you<00:01:22.860> know<00:01:23.009> and<00:01:23.330> that<00:01:24.330> that's<00:01:24.630> rotating<00:01:25.220> but

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
you know and that that's rotating but

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.060 
you know and that that's rotating but
they<00:01:26.460> sort<00:01:27.000> of<00:01:27.030> reinvented<00:01:27.720> a<00:01:27.799> notion<00:01:28.799> of<00:01:28.860> an

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
they sort of reinvented a notion of an

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.670 
they sort of reinvented a notion of an
oscillating<00:01:29.909> fan<00:01:29.970> with<00:01:30.570> with<00:01:30.990> big<00:01:31.200> panels<00:01:31.530> so

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
oscillating fan with with big panels so

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.340 
oscillating fan with with big panels so
those<00:01:31.829> getting<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.880> the<00:01:33.210> oscillating<00:01:33.720> arm

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
those getting the the oscillating arm

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.429 
those getting the the oscillating arm
they<00:01:34.650> they<00:01:34.979> going<00:01:35.250> back<00:01:35.460> so<00:01:36.299> they<00:01:36.840> moved<00:01:37.049> the

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
they they going back so they moved the

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.590 
they they going back so they moved the
air<00:01:37.650> about<00:01:38.520> with<00:01:38.759> the<00:01:38.880> span<00:01:39.090> up<00:01:39.180> but<00:01:39.360> they<00:01:39.450> also

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
air about with the span up but they also

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.130 
air about with the span up but they also
have<00:01:39.840> systems<00:01:40.229> of<00:01:40.500> big<00:01:41.100> water<00:01:41.340> walls<00:01:42.140> where

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
have systems of big water walls where

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.429 
have systems of big water walls where
the<00:01:43.320> water<00:01:43.530> is<00:01:43.680> is<00:01:44.070> falling<00:01:44.460> down<00:01:44.930> until<00:01:45.930> to

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
the water is is falling down until to

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.319 
the water is is falling down until to
literally<00:01:46.950> base<00:01:47.310> until<00:01:47.670> it's<00:01:47.820> really<00:01:48.090> smart

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
literally base until it's really smart

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:51.889 
literally base until it's really smart
idea<00:01:49.020> set<00:01:49.500> to<00:01:49.680> take<00:01:49.920> the<00:01:50.310> way<00:01:50.490> the<00:01:50.729> water<00:01:50.970> with

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
idea set to take the way the water with

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:55.310 
idea set to take the way the water with
a<00:01:51.930> stream<00:01:52.290> of<00:01:52.320> the<00:01:52.890> water<00:01:53.130> of<00:01:53.430> that<00:01:54.049> world<00:01:55.049> warm

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
a stream of the water of that world warm

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.170 
a stream of the water of that world warm
so<00:01:56.219> what<00:01:56.340> you're<00:01:56.460> saying<00:01:56.700> is<00:01:56.850> that<00:01:57.060> the

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
so what you're saying is that the

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.460 
so what you're saying is that the
humidity

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:58.470 
humidity

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:00.590 
humidity
