00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 hi people i am albert of web.de and 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:07.080
 In this video I show you as you 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.760
 you windows do not look at yours 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.980
 supports the smartphone can bring 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.710
 Microsoft has the update only for 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.990
 few devices rolled out and should be yours 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.789
 falls not have been supplied 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.189
 then you can with this little one 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.150
 registry hacks windows 10 on yours 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.850
 get a smartphone 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.730
 the procedure is however everything 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.980
 other than risk free and we recommend 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.140
 There is no way this procedure 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.809
 because you risk 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.000
 potentially your smartphone and you can 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.719
 it may never be again afterwards 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.129
 use 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.200
 So it's really only for users 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.090
 they already thought of their old one 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.030
 smartphone for example adopted 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:47.460
 actually and not really 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.350
 it would be a shame if it was not 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.090
 more works for example the 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.340
 we had to do it all on the microsoft 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.989
 lumia 535 but I can do that 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.149
 users already say that at least 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:00.000
 the first preview not yet with the 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:02.100
 lumia 535 is compatible with the display 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.110
 After the first book, you will be black 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.270
 must the software then with the lumia 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.580
 Software ecoroute repair 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.159
 that is currently it is at least the 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.289
 not worth the effort on this smartphone 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.939
 we have so far very different 

00:01:13.289 --> 00:01:16.770
 heard reports about the whole 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:19.319
 on the smartphones works 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:22.590
 definitely not our 535 year 

00:01:19.319 --> 00:01:24.569
 on the lumia 15 20 and you 13.20 me 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.539
 windows ten is supposed to be quite good so far 

00:01:24.569 --> 00:01:29.310
 work on the lumia 520 leaves it 

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:32.219
 not install yourself as well as on 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:35.700
 some htc 8 s other users report 

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:38.700
 after you have the smartphone reset 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.649
 that it works with samsung 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.270
 tvs we have so far only unanimous 

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:43.770
 reports that it belongs to 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.909
 any case does not work and therefore 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.849
 We especially recommend these 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.079
 smartphones too heightened caution 

00:01:46.849 --> 00:01:50.729
 After these words of caution we can 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:52.770
 also to act and as 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:56.069
 first requires her windows phone 8 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.810
 Seek this under windows phone dot com 

00:01:56.069 --> 00:01:59.340
 you can download as well 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.560
 a developer account to her under 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.599
 You can create app studio for free 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.489
 then starts the developer registration 

00:02:03.599 --> 00:02:08.099
 tool and registered your cellphone as 

00:02:05.489 --> 00:02:09.479
 developer smartphone and then that 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:11.700
 windows phone application deployment 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:14.129
 tool and then install the custom 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.230
 he is with us on the 

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:17.970
 iaa de download you can download 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.829
 also download the registry editor 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:22.109
 and stores it on the SD card or 

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:24.180
 smartphones then invite you to the 

00:02:22.109 --> 00:02:26.450
 preview followed advertising by app 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:30.130
 and stores it on the SD card 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:32.230
 now starts the custom gps system f 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:34.810
 and just follow the steps like here 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:38.020
 in the video chooses the root first 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:40.540
 directory of sd card then selects 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:42.700
 the preview before the press here 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:44.110
 is selected by default and then 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:48.130
 Do you take that from behind on the 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:49.780
 Smartphone loaded xp file then yours 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:51.990
 hopefully find it on the sd card 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:55.300
 can that be just the registry editor 

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:59.250
 and the latch before the world's press is 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:03:02.170
 then overwritten so now starts the 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:07.170
 private farmer price from and navigates to 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:09.280
 registry editor there you go to h klm 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:11.800
 system platform and then to device 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.960
 target info there he writes first 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:16.780
 the new vmware revision number into it 

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:19.570
 then have the new equipment and also 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:22.510
 then to the operators if you so 

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:24.280
 you're done with the 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:26.530
 windows insider app looking for updates 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:28.720
 and install the update already 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:30.640
 and that 's about it you've got 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:32.440
 then either a used device or 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:34.450
 do not support windows 10 on yours 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:36.580
 smartphone depending on you can do it too 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:38.320
 Let us know if the windows 

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:40.510

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:42.340
 fill out a small survey and me

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:45.700
 I want to link videos again 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:48.070
 repeat that this is a 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:49.420
 trades very risky and 

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:50.980
 I really start it 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:52.990
 or actually nobody 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:54.460
 he does not recommend it properly 

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:56.620
 said goodbye to his smartphone 

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:57.940
 or at least he knows how 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:59.920
 can undo again 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:02.380
 if she did risk it and then 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:04.240
 something goes wrong I like to stand 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:06.100
 You can order me anytime in 

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:08.410

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:11.170
 can help with the problem 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:13.530
