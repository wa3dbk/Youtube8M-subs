00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:08.820
 we would have to do it with us 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:12.389
 the tried and tested methods and chains 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:14.220
 also with the proven elastic method 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:17.550
 I do not have a lot of the community 

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:20.550
 made as usual because that's the yarn 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:23.519
 the whole thing is here for the end 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:27.749
 has not used a video like that 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:30.890
 great run length so i count 

00:00:27.749 --> 00:00:33.750
 make a little bit of a right-hand bend 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:35.940
 always take turns rowing them right 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:39.390
 mesh and I count from there 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:42.090
 So start the right way here 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:45.570
 with a stitch on the left a stitch 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:49.380
 on the right, a mesh crossed on the left 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:52.580
 a mesh on the right always crossed like that 

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:52.580
 continue the whole round 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:01:03.150
 that fits in well with this pattern here 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.679
 At the needle transition, I would now have two 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:10.469
 Of course, I would like to do that with left-hand stitches 

00:01:04.679 --> 00:01:13.799
 not so i take the left does that 

00:01:10.469 --> 00:01:15.329
 next needle and knit two stitches 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:18.479
 left together 

00:01:15.329 --> 00:01:21.749
 you can of course also an alternative 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:26.090
 should take with you too 

00:01:21.749 --> 00:01:28.530
 collide two equal mesh and 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:31.770
 so that it just out of the 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:35.880
 Pattern therefore always continues a stitch 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:38.819
 on the right, a mesh crossed into left 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:43.409
 a round and in the end I have too 

00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:45.869
 Once again I would have one more time 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:50.149
 two equal stitches side by side 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:54.299
 I knit two left stitches together 

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:56.249
 so in the next round stretched one 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:02:01.770
 mesh right his mesh left so 

00:01:56.249 --> 00:02:04.079
 without ever getting his own 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.599
 left and these two round 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:08.399
 you always repeat one by turns 

00:02:06.599 --> 00:02:09.750
 mesh on the right crossed a mesh 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.240
 Left 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:16.200
 and a round one stitch right his 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:17.790
 mesh left how high the cuff makes 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.280
 that is a matter of taste 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:23.670
 I do most of the time I have ten here 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:26.100
 you can do ten or twelve 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:28.080
 women make after 14 rounds if the 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:34.560
 love to have a higher covenant 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:36.570
 and that we want here 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.480
 entangled mesh not entangled 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:42.300
 meshes in the turns take turns 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:44.970
 to that a nicely drawn 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.360
 but still very elastic 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.090
 is 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.709
 I have one last round here 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:52.320
 round 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:54.930
 Knitted right and left and knit 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:58.800
 Now a round right stitch 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:05.850
 about it with a somewhat thicker nobility 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:08.520
 so needle half a millimeter thicker so 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:11.640
 and now it's down to the chains I'm looking for 

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:15.269
 only one needle in the right one 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:18.269
 strength you barely believe it but i'm looking 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:20.070
 I always have a lot of needles 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:23.250
 as I know, I always search 

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:26.130
 matching needles such a stitch right 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:28.590
 and another mesh right now with the 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:32.430
 left needles both stitches a stitch 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:35.190
 around this right folded together 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:39.150
 together stretch new idea but is very 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:41.690
 I think it's more bendable than stop 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:44.459
 I will not be happy with that 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:46.739
 again a stitch right and back from 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:52.500
 to the left in the stitches and 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:55.049
 this one pokes right through 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:57.769
 entangled deterred so it works 

00:03:55.049 --> 00:04:00.420
 nothing i needed another needle 

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:02.780
 well then i take some short ones 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:02.780
 IDPro 

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:07.620
 and again a stitch right from the left 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:12.140
 pierce in the mesh and this 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:16.670
 knit right folded together 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:19.890
 always so on until you're around 

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:26.850
 and the whole gives a quite a 

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:31.530
 particularly elastic ab kit knew on 

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:34.020
 cut off the thread with about 30 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:36.930
 cm and pull through the last stitch 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:40.500
 and this jigsaw system stands 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:43.290
 and when sewing around you made visible 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:45.390
 look at the shape of the 

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:49.730
 It's really very nice 

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:53.070
 elastic it widens outwards 

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:56.310
 if you of course wait even stronger 

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:58.650
 then you should already after the 

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:01.650
 to take a little mesh 

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:05.220
 but for this an elastic cuff 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:08.160
 this technique of the deal is perfect 

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:09.450
 So these were our september socks 

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:14.060
 Have fun with it 

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:14.060
 soon it starts with the october socks
