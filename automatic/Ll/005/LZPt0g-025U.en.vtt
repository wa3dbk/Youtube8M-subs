00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.760
 hello to all and all these friezes 

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:11.559
 today a little special video in 

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:15.490
 did I filmed I did the grace 

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:18.400
 to mejia and grow up there I did not have to 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:20.200
 my voice there simply because he 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:23.260
 was very late he had to be towards 

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:25.900
 2 o'clock in the morning and never the 

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:27.759
 family who slept at my house no I 'm going 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.949
 enjoy this video already for you 

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:31.839
 talk about how did this grace 

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:34.780
 wall with rosie there it would allow 

00:00:31.839 --> 00:00:37.120
 do a little buzz tall ships and 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:38.559
 after we will talk a few things I 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:42.520
 do not know in any case already we will speak 

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:44.320
 from them we will talk about this grade mcgraw 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:48.039
 hill so the clip will surely be in 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:50.289
 accelerated as I speak offline so 

00:00:48.039 --> 00:00:53.289
 already we will talk about how it was 

00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:54.520
 spent actually I was looking for archis 

00:00:53.289 --> 00:00:57.579
 monsters and it's someone who has me 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:01:01.820
 proposed to make a grace mejÃ­a and 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:02.930
 and a big deal with them and 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:04.460
 simply because they 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:06.080
 knew my chain so suddenly 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:10.550
 I accepted, however, I did not 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:12.400
 no quest of the coup it was good 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:14.630
 problematic 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:16.490
 so I was doing the quest 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:18.410
 admission to vulcania so I was 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:21.800
 quickly recovered in a quarter of an hour 

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:24.380
 just about every piece of the totem for 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:26.509
 access grasse mejia and cozy there it's 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:29.060
 a real mess you have to admit it's a 

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:30.880
 true brothel to access it is a real 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:33.200
 labyrinth this island I galley 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:37.560
 but hey I parked and I managed to 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:40.290
 have the targets of the totem and g 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.479
 how do I say and I won 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.310
 three million ten countries of lacq is so 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:47.789
 which was not negligible either 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.990
 it made me take 2% xp I 

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:53.850
 believe something in the genre 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:55.380
 so it was quite interesting after 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.630
 so we had to wait for 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.909
 three hours two guys there who had had 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.200
 who lives from evil to come 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:03.450
 we dungeoned numerous dungeons and 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.950
 we did the Don Juan De Jongh and 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.930
 composed of 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.860
 two rooms two rooms two drops 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:10.690
 water 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:15.990
 how many sketches 5 sketches each I 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:15.990
 think fast enough to do it anyway 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.830
 excuse me little ellipses so yes I 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.120
 were saying that what was easy enough to 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:24.490
 make 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:29.950
 it took us ten minutes 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:32.590
 to make the two rooms were 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:34.840
 not very long it must be said that we had 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:40.540
 still a team enough thl we had 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:46.360
 a and 499 1 and 4 95 so mine 1 5175 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:49.860
 diop 180 190 and another 181.1 is neither a 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:53.760
 enemy in minhotos so to ch she too 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:56.560
 is a osamodas 190 I also believe 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:59.350
 so it was pretty fast and after 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:01.170
 fact we got to swill 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:05.489
 mejia is fat and 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:07.110
 and big and there we took the tired because 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:09.900
 we were not sure to manage 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:12.030
 the town grath with rosie the normal of 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.360
 blow we took the fact the tired and 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:15.280
 we have been 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.920
 surprised to see that it was easy enough 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.870
 and 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:20.280
 already we lost the sadi en route because 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.420
 that he failed to get into the 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.069
 room I do not know why it's 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:25.349
 surely still a little bug on the part 

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:29.550
 of a case my and after the coup we have 

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:32.680
 fought thanks mejia is fat he has 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:35.320
 while we're going to say I'm more beautiful a 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:36.910
 twenty minutes who was who 

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:38.110
 it was nice we even managed to 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:40.750
 to make a cat when you do not have 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:42.400
 to be able to see it on the video we've been 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:43.800
 astonished elsewhere you will see in 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.260
 the channel that 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:48.270
 we went that she is thanks no laugh 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:51.030
 gonzi laon not so much typed 

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:53.100
 loud he was typing 400 each by the 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:55.860
 villa group that typed from 1400 to the end 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:57.810
 of a moment and it was really it was 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:59.340
 that was starting to do a little bit more 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:02.070
 badly but he typed that once on the 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:03.990
 1400 good after that is that pv 

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:07.260
 in fact if there is no technique for 

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:09.420
 the relay the extra vulnerability is enough 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:13.290
 to type with an emmy in addition to next 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:15.320
 this is his fall is fast enough to true 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:15.320
 say 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:18.640
 they still have a lot of 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:19.650
 resistances striking without resistance 

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:22.360
 everyone etc 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:25.150
 good once that was it was 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:27.010
 finished we had to win I believe 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:28.270
 that it was 4 million xp the guy from 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:31.060
 boss so it's always fun 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:33.430
 to have a country x p and at the end of the 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:34.600
 video down at the end of the vi which i was 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:37.930
 glad to hear that I had won 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:39.880
 Super Heroes Super Mode 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:41.890
 hero actually when the water goes from 

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:44.290
 characters dancing there after he does a 

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:45.700
 position and the at war and I will have I 

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:46.660
 dreamed of having this emotes and I do not 

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:48.130
 did not know we were going to be able to 

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:49.210
 win by doing this keep pampering 

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:51.280
 that in fact we wanted he said that 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:53.610
 last year so now I am 

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:55.810
 super happy g7 and cat mode and that's it 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:58.480
 I also wanted this video all 

00:04:55.810 --> 00:05:01.180
 simply because it's thanks perret 

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:02.500
 has grown this year I would have played 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:04.570
 there were a lot of people who had done 

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:06.070
 the video is not me because I'm 

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:08.689
 was saying good here you win a block 

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:11.149
 down finally I had you seen that 

00:05:08.689 --> 00:05:14.989
 it's not something that's common 

00:05:11.149 --> 00:05:16.610
 and suddenly I take advantage of it anyway I 

00:05:14.989 --> 00:05:19.009
