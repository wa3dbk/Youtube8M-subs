00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.880 
put in another one set it up it doesn't
work<00:00:56.720> and<00:00:57.720> the<00:00:57.900> reason<00:00:58.170> it<00:00:58.260> doesn't<00:00:58.410> work<00:00:58.560> is

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
work and the reason it doesn't work is

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.190 
work and the reason it doesn't work is
because<00:00:59.370> there<00:00:59.790> is<00:01:00.060> a<00:01:00.090> little<00:01:00.600> line<00:01:00.720> of<00:01:00.870> code

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:01.200 
because there is a little line of code

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:05.329 
because there is a little line of code
on<00:01:01.620> the<00:01:02.489> text<00:01:02.820> file<00:01:03.030> on<00:01:03.480> your<00:01:03.780> SD<00:01:04.199> card<00:01:04.470> that

tells it when you put in a new card to
keep<00:01:08.640> the<00:01:08.820> settings<00:01:09.180> from<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:09.570> card<00:01:09.780> that<00:01:10.020> was

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:22.549 
would do that it seems like a simple

without a computer but then again it's
also<00:01:29.190> a<00:01:29.370> reason<00:01:29.820> to<00:01:30.000> upgrade<00:01:30.450> to<00:01:30.750> a<00:01:30.890> $500

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890

but here I'm going to go all the way

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:09.370 
but here I'm going to go all the way
across<00:04:07.010> the<00:04:07.340> board<00:04:07.550> read-only<00:04:08.030> and<00:04:08.510> then<00:04:08.810> lock

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:09.380 
across the board read-only and then lock

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:11.350 
across the board read-only and then lock
lock<00:04:10.340> that<00:04:10.520> file<00:04:10.760> so<00:04:10.910> you<00:04:10.970> get<00:04:11.090> that<00:04:11.209> nice

lock that file so you get that nice
little<00:04:11.420> lock<00:04:11.900> icon<00:04:12.110> next<00:04:12.680> to<00:04:12.860> it<00:04:13.040> that<00:04:13.070> means

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:13.370 
little lock icon next to it that means

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:17.050 
little lock icon next to it that means

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:21.799 
in here and unlocking it so we're to

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:24.430 
in here and unlocking it so we're to
kind<00:04:21.980> of<00:04:22.010> replace<00:04:22.310> the<00:04:23.020> file<00:04:24.020> that<00:04:24.290> was

kind of replace the file that was

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:28.990 
kind of replace the file that was
already<00:04:24.710> on<00:04:24.919> this<00:04:25.130> SD<00:04:25.550> card<00:04:25.820> so<00:04:26.210> we<00:04:26.419> have<00:04:26.740> an<00:04:28.000> SD

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:29.000 
already on this SD card so we have an SD

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.080 
already on this SD card so we have an SD
card<00:04:29.030> that's

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:30.090 
card that's

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:34.520 
card that's

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:34.530 
locked to 1080p recording and that's

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:36.500 
locked to 1080p recording and that's
pretty<00:04:34.800> much<00:04:34.949> it<00:04:35.220> when<00:04:35.699> I've<00:04:35.820> gone<00:04:36.060> and<00:04:36.449> done

I'll get an AP video recording card in

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:15.730 
I'll get an AP video recording card in
here<00:05:10.530> and<00:05:11.720> flick<00:05:12.720> it<00:05:12.840> on<00:05:12.960> and<00:05:13.260> show<00:05:13.530> you<00:05:13.590> that

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:18.450 
it's a steady light that means it's

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:23.180 
it's a steady light that means it's
recording<00:05:18.900> video<00:05:20.600> all<00:05:21.600> right<00:05:22.070> I've<00:05:23.070> got

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:23.190 
recording video all right I've got

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:25.420 
recording video all right I've got
another<00:05:23.610> card<00:05:23.910> set<00:05:24.180> up<00:05:24.270> here<00:05:24.539> to<00:05:24.810> take

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:25.430 
another card set up here to take

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:29.779 
another card set up here to take
continuous<00:05:26.430> photos<00:05:26.940> every<00:05:27.840> one<00:05:28.530> second<00:05:29.070> and

00:05:29.779 --> 00:05:29.789 
continuous photos every one second and

00:05:29.789 --> 00:05:31.969 
continuous photos every one second and
the<00:05:30.539> reason<00:05:30.870> you'll<00:05:30.990> know<00:05:31.110> this<00:05:31.289> is<00:05:31.470> working

00:05:31.969 --> 00:05:31.979 
the reason you'll know this is working

00:05:31.979 --> 00:05:34.330 
the reason you'll know this is working
is<00:05:32.220> cuz<00:05:32.550> you'll<00:05:32.760> see<00:05:32.970> the<00:05:33.150> light<00:05:33.389> on<00:05:33.660> the<00:05:34.139> front

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:34.340 
is cuz you'll see the light on the front

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:36.909 
is cuz you'll see the light on the front
blinking<00:05:35.340> every<00:05:35.639> time<00:05:35.789> it<00:05:36.000> takes<00:05:36.180> the<00:05:36.330> photo

00:05:36.909 --> 00:05:36.919 
blinking every time it takes the photo

00:05:36.919 --> 00:05:39.800 
blinking every time it takes the photo
both<00:05:37.919> of<00:05:38.070> these<00:05:38.190> colors<00:05:38.460> all<00:05:39.180> you<00:05:39.389> have<00:05:39.570> to<00:05:39.660> do

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:39.810 
both of these colors all you have to do

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:45.230 
both of these colors all you have to do
is<00:05:40.820> copy<00:05:41.820> em<00:05:42.030> off<00:05:42.450> of<00:05:42.510> the<00:05:43.669> SD<00:05:44.669> card<00:05:44.910> when<00:05:45.150> the

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:45.240 
is copy em off of the SD card when the

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:46.700 
is copy em off of the SD card when the
cameras<00:05:45.539> plug<00:05:45.750> in<00:05:45.900> you<00:05:46.110> see<00:05:46.289> it's<00:05:46.440> flashing

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:46.710 
cameras plug in you see it's flashing

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:48.800 
cameras plug in you see it's flashing
now<00:05:46.979> it's<00:05:47.160> taking<00:05:47.460> a<00:05:47.520> photo<00:05:47.729> every<00:05:48.120> one<00:05:48.270> second

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:48.810 
now it's taking a photo every one second

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:51.920 
now it's taking a photo every one second
now<00:05:49.800> I<00:05:49.830> can<00:05:50.220> keep<00:05:50.490> swapping<00:05:51.210> these<00:05:51.479> back<00:05:51.720> and

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:51.930 
now I can keep swapping these back and

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:55.540 
now I can keep swapping these back and
forth<00:05:52.229> all<00:05:52.650> day<00:05:53.580> long<00:05:53.820> to<00:05:54.180> prove<00:05:54.450> to<00:05:54.720> you<00:05:54.900> that

forth all day long to prove to you that

00:05:55.550 --> 00:06:00.310 
forth all day long to prove to you that
it<00:05:56.550> will<00:05:56.729> not<00:05:56.880> revert<00:05:57.389> and<00:05:57.660> keep<00:05:58.349> one<00:05:58.680> setting

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:00.320 
it will not revert and keep one setting

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:03.650 
it will not revert and keep one setting
when<00:06:01.320> you<00:06:01.380> change<00:06:01.650> colors<00:06:02.039> now<00:06:02.940> the<00:06:03.000> one<00:06:03.419> thing

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:03.660 
when you change colors now the one thing

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:05.659 
when you change colors now the one thing
that<00:06:03.930> will<00:06:04.289> make<00:06:04.500> that<00:06:04.680> happen<00:06:04.740> is<00:06:05.220> if<00:06:05.370> you<00:06:05.490> hit

00:06:05.659 --> 00:06:05.669 
that will make that happen is if you hit

00:06:05.669 --> 00:06:09.219 
that will make that happen is if you hit
the<00:06:05.910> format<00:06:06.389> button<00:06:06.690> if<00:06:07.020> you<00:06:07.470> do<00:06:07.680> that<00:06:07.889> it<00:06:08.700> will

00:06:09.219 --> 00:06:09.229 
the format button if you do that it will

00:06:09.229 --> 00:06:11.800 
the format button if you do that it will
overwrite<00:06:10.229> the<00:06:10.260> file<00:06:10.950> that's<00:06:11.220> on<00:06:11.340> the<00:06:11.460> card

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:11.810 
overwrite the file that's on the card

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:14.420 
overwrite the file that's on the card
using<00:06:12.810> the<00:06:12.930> firmware<00:06:13.200> that's<00:06:13.860> on<00:06:14.039> that<00:06:14.160> card

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:14.430 
using the firmware that's on that card

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:18.620 
using the firmware that's on that card
