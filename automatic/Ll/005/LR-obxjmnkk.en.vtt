up<00:00:30.929> the<00:00:31.170> blink<00:00:31.439> and<00:00:31.679> then<00:00:31.830> you're<00:00:32.160> just<00:00:32.189> over

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790

and then everybody who you're going to
be<00:00:34.079> with<00:00:34.230> it's<00:00:34.440> just<00:00:34.620> going<00:00:34.739> to<00:00:34.770> be<00:00:34.829> angry<00:00:35.040> at

be with it's just going to be angry at
you<00:00:35.370> and<00:00:35.820> obviously<00:00:36.780> if<00:00:36.870> you<00:00:36.930> by<00:00:37.079> itself<00:00:37.380> it

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
you and obviously if you by itself it

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.290 
you and obviously if you by itself it
doesn't<00:00:37.710> really<00:00:37.920> matter<00:00:38.100> but<00:00:38.820> if<00:00:38.940> you<00:00:39.030> like

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
doesn't really matter but if you like

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.270 
doesn't really matter but if you like
with<00:00:39.510> a<00:00:39.540> friend<00:00:39.780> or<00:00:39.870> something<00:00:39.930> it's<00:00:40.290> just<00:00:40.440> but

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
with a friend or something it's just but

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.790 
with a friend or something it's just but
only<00:00:41.370> reason<00:00:41.910> you're<00:00:42.030> doing<00:00:42.059> this<00:00:42.420> is<00:00:42.899> to<00:00:43.680> make

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
only reason you're doing this is to make

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.250 
only reason you're doing this is to make
it<00:00:44.070> quicker<00:00:44.309> and<00:00:44.460> so<00:00:45.329> you<00:00:45.390> may<00:00:45.660> as<00:00:45.690> well<00:00:45.989> do<00:00:46.230> it

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
it quicker and so you may as well do it

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.229 
it quicker and so you may as well do it
the<00:00:46.559> most<00:00:46.890> efficient<00:00:47.250> way<00:00:47.280> possible<00:00:47.370> and<00:00:47.910> I'll

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
the most efficient way possible and I'll

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:49.490 
the most efficient way possible and I'll
show<00:00:48.390> you<00:00:48.450> that<00:00:48.539> in<00:00:48.660> a<00:00:48.750> bit<00:00:48.870> that's<00:00:49.230> triple

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
show you that in a bit that's triple

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.069 
show you that in a bit that's triple
jump<00:00:49.770> so<00:00:50.700> we're<00:00:51.329> going<00:00:51.420> to<00:00:51.510> be<00:00:51.570> using<00:00:51.600> blink

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
jump so we're going to be using blink

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.990 
jump so we're going to be using blink
first<00:00:52.260> this<00:00:52.500> is<00:00:52.559> just<00:00:52.949> the<00:00:53.070> show-off<00:00:53.550> method

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
first this is just the show-off method

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.080 
first this is just the show-off method
and<00:00:54.559> just<00:00:55.559> to<00:00:55.710> get<00:00:55.949> across<00:00:56.160> really<00:00:56.579> quickly<00:00:57.000> in

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
and just to get across really quickly in

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.849 
and just to get across really quickly in
nicely<00:00:57.300> and<00:00:57.719> but<00:00:58.230> you<00:00:58.289> can<00:00:58.410> only<00:00:58.440> really<00:00:58.710> do

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
nicely and but you can only really do

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.130 
nicely and but you can only really do
this<00:00:59.039> if<00:00:59.280> you<00:00:59.430> can<00:00:59.609> use<00:00:59.879> blink<00:01:00.239> now<00:01:00.600> blink<00:01:00.870> it's

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
this if you can use blink now blink it's

the<00:01:39.090> air<00:01:39.210> again<00:01:39.329> and<00:01:39.750> then<00:01:40.140> you<00:01:40.619> can<00:01:40.770> get

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
the air again and then you can get

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.429 
the air again and then you can get
across<00:01:41.579> so<00:01:42.329> now<00:01:42.450> we're<00:01:42.600> across<00:01:42.780> let's<00:01:43.110> go<00:01:43.229> kill

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
across so now we're across let's go kill

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.740 
across so now we're across let's go kill
the<00:01:43.530> sword-bearer<00:01:43.939> before<00:01:44.939> he<00:01:45.090> can<00:01:45.240> /<00:01:45.540> me<00:01:45.720> a

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
used to be able to do that blink so and

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.170 
used to be able to do that blink so and
just<00:02:04.860> watch<00:02:05.100> yourself<00:02:05.250> and<00:02:05.759> trying<00:02:05.939> to<00:02:06.060> do

that so next I'm going to be showing you
how<00:02:09.239> to<00:02:09.270> do<00:02:09.569> that<00:02:09.780> jump

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:10.750 
how to do that jump

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:15.090 
how to do that jump
with<00:02:11.650> a<00:02:11.860> golden<00:02:12.550> gun<00:02:12.730> guy<00:02:12.940> or<00:02:13.800> otherwise<00:02:14.800> known

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:15.100 
with a golden gun guy or otherwise known

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:17.820 
with a golden gun guy or otherwise known
as<00:02:15.130> a<00:02:15.610> gunslinger<00:02:16.270> now<00:02:17.200> I<00:02:17.230> forgot<00:02:17.680> to<00:02:17.800> mention

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
as a gunslinger now I forgot to mention

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:19.530 
as a gunslinger now I forgot to mention
a<00:02:18.100> minute<00:02:18.310> ago<00:02:18.370> that<00:02:18.700> you<00:02:18.850> can<00:02:19.060> actually<00:02:19.210> do

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
a minute ago that you can actually do

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.860 
a minute ago that you can actually do
that<00:02:19.570> blink<00:02:20.200> method<00:02:20.880> without<00:02:21.880> my<00:02:22.240> demo<00:02:22.450> at<00:02:22.600> all

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
that blink method without my demo at all

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.790 
that blink method without my demo at all
except<00:02:24.000> it's<00:02:25.000> really<00:02:25.660> inconsistent<00:02:26.110> in<00:02:26.470> a<00:02:26.530> lot

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:26.800 
except it's really inconsistent in a lot

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.410 
except it's really inconsistent in a lot
of<00:02:26.890> it<00:02:26.980> like<00:02:27.160> about<00:02:27.550> eight<00:02:27.730> times<00:02:27.910> out<00:02:28.120> of<00:02:28.180> 10

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
of it like about eight times out of 10

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:30.570 
of it like about eight times out of 10
you<00:02:28.450> will<00:02:28.660> just<00:02:28.900> fall<00:02:29.080> off<00:02:29.110> the<00:02:29.230> edge<00:02:29.440> and<00:02:29.830> so

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.580 
you will just fall off the edge and so

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:32.370 
you will just fall off the edge and so
is<00:02:30.760> its<00:02:30.970> highly<00:02:31.510> suggested<00:02:32.020> like<00:02:32.140> you<00:02:32.200> either

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:32.380 
is its highly suggested like you either

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:36.080 
is its highly suggested like you either
you<00:02:32.650> might<00:02:33.430> have<00:02:33.520> more<00:02:33.610> tool<00:02:33.880> or<00:02:34.140> run<00:02:35.140> a<00:02:35.320> guns

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
you might have more tool or run a guns

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.490 
you might have more tool or run a guns
so<00:02:37.090> I<00:02:37.150> keep<00:02:37.300> saying<00:02:37.480> around<00:02:37.690> gunslinger<00:02:38.230> sorry

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
so I keep saying around gunslinger sorry

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.520 
so I keep saying around gunslinger sorry
and<00:02:38.770> so<00:02:39.700> we're<00:02:40.450> using<00:02:40.630> our<00:02:40.870> triple<00:02:41.230> jump<00:02:41.380> now

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 
and so we're using our triple jump now

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:43.620 
and so we're using our triple jump now
which<00:02:41.770> is<00:02:42.040> easily<00:02:42.370> the<00:02:42.700> most<00:02:42.820> efficient<00:02:43.570> way

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:43.630 
which is easily the most efficient way

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:45.120 
which is easily the most efficient way
of<00:02:43.720> getting<00:02:44.050> across<00:02:44.200> except<00:02:44.800> if<00:02:44.950> you're<00:02:45.100> a

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.130 
of getting across except if you're a

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:48.030 
of getting across except if you're a
tighter<00:02:45.430> and<00:02:45.580> if<00:02:45.700> you're<00:02:45.820> tighten<00:02:46.209> this<00:02:47.040> this

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
tighter and if you're tighten this this

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.130 
tighter and if you're tighten this this
is<00:02:48.160> just<00:02:48.340> easy<00:02:48.610> as<00:02:48.760> anything<00:02:48.850> and<00:02:49.840> i'll<00:02:49.959> link

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
is just easy as anything and i'll link

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:51.990 
is just easy as anything and i'll link
you<00:02:50.320> to<00:02:50.350> the<00:02:50.530> titan<00:02:51.010> part<00:02:51.489> of<00:02:51.580> the<00:02:51.640> video<00:02:51.850> the

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
you to the titan part of the video the

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.610 
you to the titan part of the video the
end<00:02:52.060> of<00:02:52.209> this<00:02:52.270> and<00:02:52.570> now<00:02:53.230> we're<00:02:53.380> going<00:02:53.500> to<00:02:53.560> be

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
end of this and now we're going to be

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:55.979 
end of this and now we're going to be
using<00:02:53.650> the<00:02:54.489> gunslinger<00:02:55.090> now<00:02:55.239> we've<00:02:55.750> mida

00:02:55.979 --> 00:02:55.989 
using the gunslinger now we've mida

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:57.479 
using the gunslinger now we've mida
multi-tool<00:02:56.260> and<00:02:56.620> then<00:02:56.860> i'll<00:02:56.980> be<00:02:57.100> showing<00:02:57.280> you

00:02:57.479 --> 00:02:57.489 
multi-tool and then i'll be showing you

00:02:57.489 --> 00:02:59.430 
multi-tool and then i'll be showing you
it<00:02:57.670> without<00:02:58.120> got<00:02:58.540> mine<00:02:58.690> immortal<00:02:59.110> it's<00:02:59.230> just<00:02:59.380> a

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 
it without got mine immortal it's just a

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:02.070 
it without got mine immortal it's just a
little<00:02:59.620> bit<00:02:59.739> more<00:02:59.890> difficult<00:03:00.870> so<00:03:01.870> the<00:03:01.959> first

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:02.080 
little bit more difficult so the first

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:03.150 
little bit more difficult so the first
thing<00:03:02.260> we<00:03:02.410> want<00:03:02.500> to<00:03:02.590> do<00:03:02.709> obviously<00:03:03.040> is

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:03.160 
thing we want to do obviously is

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:04.890 
thing we want to do obviously is
activate<00:03:03.850> your<00:03:03.940> plate<00:03:04.090> however<00:03:04.330> i'm<00:03:04.690> going<00:03:04.840> to

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:04.900 
activate your plate however i'm going to

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:06.600 
activate your plate however i'm going to
show<00:03:05.020> you<00:03:05.050> my<00:03:05.200> class<00:03:05.410> self<00:03:05.650> first<00:03:05.920> so<00:03:06.220> here<00:03:06.489> we

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:06.610 
show you my class self first so here we

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:10.760 
show you my class self first so here we
go<00:03:07.830> so<00:03:08.830> we've<00:03:08.980> got<00:03:09.130> triple<00:03:09.700> jump<00:03:09.880> obviously

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:10.770 
go so we've got triple jump obviously

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:13.590 
go so we've got triple jump obviously
and<00:03:11.770> then<00:03:11.920> we've<00:03:12.070> got<00:03:12.100> puffed<00:03:13.060> forbidden<00:03:13.180> and

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:13.600 
and then we've got puffed forbidden and

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:16.050 
and then we've got puffed forbidden and
wave<00:03:14.230> a<00:03:14.410> drifter<00:03:14.830> and<00:03:15.459> that's<00:03:15.700> a<00:03:15.760> little<00:03:15.880> bit

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060 
wave a drifter and that's a little bit

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:19.470 
wave a drifter and that's a little bit
different<00:03:16.480> with<00:03:16.830> with<00:03:18.090> gunslinger<00:03:19.090> because

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
different with with gunslinger because

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.090 
different with with gunslinger because
puffs<00:03:19.989> have<00:03:20.140> forgotten<00:03:20.590> is<00:03:20.709> actually

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:21.100 
puffs have forgotten is actually

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:22.710 
puffs have forgotten is actually
actually<00:03:21.760> never<00:03:22.090> just<00:03:22.299> either<00:03:22.420> way<00:03:22.510> around

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720 
actually never just either way around
