the chorus you've just done another
thing<00:00:22.920> to<00:00:23.039> do<00:00:23.220> is<00:00:23.490> to<00:00:24.420> look<00:00:24.660> at<00:00:24.810> the

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
thing to do is to look at the

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.439 
thing to do is to look at the
fundamentals<00:00:25.560> of<00:00:25.890> a<00:00:26.010> scale<00:00:26.369> like<00:00:26.640> you've<00:00:27.180> got

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
fundamentals of a scale like you've got

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.999 
fundamentals of a scale like you've got
your<00:00:28.199> root<00:00:29.010> note<00:00:30.080> in<00:00:31.080> this<00:00:31.289> case<00:00:31.560> with<00:00:31.800> enough

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
your root note in this case with enough

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.240 
your root note in this case with enough
is<00:00:32.189> a<00:00:32.219> G<00:00:32.550> and<00:00:32.850> then<00:00:33.690> I've<00:00:33.809> got<00:00:34.079> my<00:00:34.559> perfect

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
is a G and then I've got my perfect

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.990 
is a G and then I've got my perfect
fourth<00:00:35.579> and<00:00:35.880> fifth<00:00:36.180> so<00:00:36.710> the<00:00:37.710> one<00:00:38.610> four<00:00:38.879> and

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
fourth and fifth so the one four and

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:46.910 
fourth and fifth so the one four and
five<00:00:39.210> and<00:00:39.480> this<00:00:39.739> this<00:00:40.739> key<00:00:41.040> is<00:00:41.219> G<00:00:41.629> C<00:00:42.629> D<00:00:44.270> and<00:00:45.920> then

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
five and this this key is G C D and then

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.430 
five and this this key is G C D and then
I've<00:00:47.070> got<00:00:47.250> a<00:00:47.280> minor<00:00:47.670> third<00:00:48.210> which<00:00:48.450> is<00:00:49.170> the<00:00:49.410> E

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
I've got a minor third which is the E

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.590 
I've got a minor third which is the E
minor<00:00:49.940> and<00:00:51.500> then<00:00:52.500> the<00:00:52.770> minor<00:00:53.129> six<00:00:53.610> which<00:00:54.390> in

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
minor and then the minor six which in

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.150 
minor and then the minor six which in
this<00:00:54.719> case<00:00:54.989> is<00:00:55.320> a<00:00:55.559> minor<00:00:56.780> so<00:00:57.780> basically<00:00:58.320> you've

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
this case is a minor so basically you've

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.700 
this case is a minor so basically you've
got<00:00:59.190> five<00:00:59.789> chords<00:01:00.510> that<00:01:00.719> you<00:01:00.809> can<00:01:00.960> play<00:01:01.289> in<00:01:01.620> a

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
got five chords that you can play in a

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.979 
got five chords that you can play in a
holding<00:01:02.129> pattern<00:01:02.210> that<00:01:03.210> will<00:01:03.480> always<00:01:03.629> sound

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
holding pattern that will always sound

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.109 
holding pattern that will always sound
good<00:01:04.290> whatever<00:01:04.530> key<00:01:04.920> you're<00:01:05.129> in<00:01:05.339> you<00:01:05.909> know

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
good whatever key you're in you know

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.289 
good whatever key you're in you know
that<00:01:06.390> you've<00:01:06.510> got<00:01:06.689> one<00:01:07.460> the<00:01:08.460> fourth<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:09.090> fifth

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
that you've got one the fourth the fifth

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.980 
that you've got one the fourth the fifth
the<00:01:09.570> minor<00:01:09.840> third<00:01:10.680> and<00:01:11.040> the<00:01:11.760> minor<00:01:12.360> sixth

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
the minor third and the minor sixth

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.960 
the minor third and the minor sixth
chord<00:01:13.350> that<00:01:13.770> you<00:01:13.979> can<00:01:14.130> put<00:01:14.340> in<00:01:14.460> some<00:01:14.640> kind<00:01:14.909> of

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
chord that you can put in some kind of

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.090 
chord that you can put in some kind of
pattern<00:01:15.180> that<00:01:15.840> will<00:01:15.990> fit<00:01:16.350> as<00:01:16.590> a<00:01:16.650> holding

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
pattern that will fit as a holding

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.550 
pattern that will fit as a holding
pattern<00:01:17.549> so<00:01:18.060> for<00:01:18.540> enough<00:01:18.840> I<00:01:19.140> might<00:01:19.320> play

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
pattern so for enough I might play

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.710 
pattern so for enough I might play
something<00:01:19.920> like<00:01:20.070> this<00:01:20.460> which<00:01:20.790> is<00:01:20.820> the<00:01:22.490> one

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:23.720 
something like this which is the one

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:28.410 
something like this which is the one
down<00:01:24.720> to<00:01:25.110> the<00:01:25.290> minor<00:01:25.590> third

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:28.420 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.020 

and<00:01:28.510> then<00:01:29.140> maybe<00:01:29.350> I<00:01:29.500> go<00:01:29.770> down<00:01:30.010> to<00:01:30.430> the<00:01:30.700> minor

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:31.030 
and then maybe I go down to the minor

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:38.580 
and then maybe I go down to the minor
six<00:01:33.510> up<00:01:34.510> to<00:01:34.810> the<00:01:34.900> fourth<00:01:35.850> and<00:01:36.850> then<00:01:37.630> up<00:01:37.780> to<00:01:37.810> the

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:38.590 
six up to the fourth and then up to the

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:41.580 
six up to the fourth and then up to the
fifth

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:41.590 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:43.920 

and<00:01:41.710> notice<00:01:42.579> -<00:01:42.880> I'm<00:01:43.090> using<00:01:43.329> some<00:01:43.689> of<00:01:43.720> the

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:43.930 
and notice - I'm using some of the

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:45.840 
and notice - I'm using some of the
approaches<00:01:44.710> we<00:01:44.799> talked<00:01:45.040> about<00:01:45.159> earlier<00:01:45.610> I'm

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:45.850 
approaches we talked about earlier I'm

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:48.359 
approaches we talked about earlier I'm
basically<00:01:46.630> playing<00:01:47.079> an<00:01:47.350> open<00:01:47.649> octave<00:01:48.189> on<00:01:48.310> the

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:48.369 
basically playing an open octave on the

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:53.190 
basically playing an open octave on the
G<00:01:48.700> for<00:01:49.060> that<00:01:49.289> so<00:01:51.000> an<00:01:52.000> arpeggio<00:01:52.329> with<00:01:52.960> just

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:53.200 
G for that so an arpeggio with just

00:01:53.200 --> 00:02:08.749 
G for that so an arpeggio with just
three<00:01:53.560> notes<00:01:54.369> G<00:01:54.909> D<00:01:55.390> and<00:01:55.720> Heidi<00:01:55.990> a<00:01:56.439> high<00:01:56.740> G

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.740 

so<00:02:09.360> use<00:02:09.840> those<00:02:10.319> different<00:02:11.310> those<00:02:11.819> five<00:02:12.090> chords

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
so use those different those five chords

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.250 
so use those different those five chords
in<00:02:13.620> any<00:02:13.950> key<00:02:14.250> you're<00:02:14.459> doing<00:02:14.790> to<00:02:15.360> give<00:02:16.140> you<00:02:16.230> a

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
in any key you're doing to give you a

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.770 
in any key you're doing to give you a
holding<00:02:16.680> pattern<00:02:16.860> that<00:02:17.190> to<00:02:17.400> play<00:02:17.780> during

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
holding pattern that to play during

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.619 
holding pattern that to play during
prayer<00:02:19.140> or<00:02:19.680> when<00:02:20.670> somebody's<00:02:21.030> speaking<00:02:21.269> if

00:02:21.619 --> 00:02:21.629 
prayer or when somebody's speaking if

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:25.010 
prayer or when somebody's speaking if
you<00:02:21.750> want<00:02:21.900> a<00:02:21.930> little<00:02:22.019> bit<00:02:22.140> of<00:02:22.230> music<00:02:22.530> behind<00:02:22.799> it
