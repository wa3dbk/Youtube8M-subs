specifically<00:00:27.210> talk<00:00:27.510> about<00:00:27.900> the<00:00:28.830> screw<00:00:29.640> models

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
specifically talk about the screw models

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.640 
specifically talk about the screw models
that<00:00:30.240> the<00:00:30.300> quick<00:00:30.510> set<00:00:30.720> will<00:00:30.900> work<00:00:31.080> with<00:00:31.289> so<00:00:31.500> let

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
that the quick set will work with so let

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:32.840 
that the quick set will work with so let
me<00:00:31.710> go<00:00:31.830> through<00:00:31.949> that<00:00:32.040> list<00:00:32.340> for<00:00:32.579> your<00:00:32.669> real

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
me go through that list for your real

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.229 
me go through that list for your real
quick<00:00:33.059> here<00:00:33.270> so<00:00:33.660> the<00:00:33.750> Subaru<00:00:34.230> b9<00:00:34.649> the<00:00:35.040> BRZ<00:00:35.340> the

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
quick here so the Subaru b9 the BRZ the

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.229 
quick here so the Subaru b9 the BRZ the
Forester<00:00:36.809> the<00:00:37.140> Impreza<00:00:37.500> the<00:00:38.129> legacy<00:00:38.820> the

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
Forester the Impreza the legacy the

Outback the Tribeca the WRX STI and the

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.160 
Outback the Tribeca the WRX STI and the
Crosstrek<00:00:46.530> okay<00:00:46.860> so<00:00:47.280> this<00:00:47.730> will<00:00:48.360> work<00:00:48.570> for<00:00:48.960> all

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
Crosstrek okay so this will work for all

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.010 
Crosstrek okay so this will work for all
those<00:00:49.530> models<00:00:49.829> it<00:00:50.160> will<00:00:50.280> allow<00:00:50.520> you<00:00:50.579> to<00:00:51.020> take

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
those models it will allow you to take

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.299 
those models it will allow you to take
sensor<00:00:52.410> IDs<00:00:52.649> and<00:00:52.800> see<00:00:52.920> you're<00:00:53.039> switching<00:00:53.219> from

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
sensor IDs and see you're switching from

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:54.950 
sensor IDs and see you're switching from
summer<00:00:53.670> to<00:00:53.760> winter<00:00:53.850> set<00:00:54.300> or<00:00:54.449> winter<00:00:54.690> to<00:00:54.809> summer

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
summer to winter set or winter to summer

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.380 
summer to winter set or winter to summer
set<00:00:55.320> are<00:00:55.710> just<00:00:55.920> simply<00:00:56.280> changing<00:00:56.910> out<00:00:57.090> a

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
set are just simply changing out a

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.319 
set are just simply changing out a
sensor<00:00:58.050> or<00:00:58.079> two<00:00:58.379> or<00:00:58.739> three<00:00:58.770> or<00:00:58.949> four<00:00:59.180> it<00:01:00.180> will

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
sensor or two or three or four it will

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.180 
sensor or two or three or four it will
allow<00:01:00.570> you<00:01:00.629> to<00:01:00.750> upload<00:01:01.109> the<00:01:01.230> sensor<00:01:01.530> idea<00:01:01.770> are

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
allow you to upload the sensor idea are

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.210 
allow you to upload the sensor idea are
these<00:01:02.550> via<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.390> quick<00:01:03.600> set<00:01:03.809> into<00:01:04.229> the<00:01:04.320> ECU<00:01:04.710> now

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
these via the quick set into the ECU now

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.240 
these via the quick set into the ECU now
every<00:01:06.210> single<00:01:06.750> Subaru<00:01:07.200> also<00:01:07.860> needs<00:01:08.100> an

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
every single Subaru also needs an

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.800 
every single Subaru also needs an
activation<00:01:08.640> tool<00:01:08.970> that's<00:01:09.210> a<00:01:09.299> tool<00:01:09.540> that's

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
activation tool that's a tool that's

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.780 
activation tool that's a tool that's
going<00:01:09.960> to<00:01:10.049> wake<00:01:10.290> those<00:01:10.470> sensors<00:01:10.920> up<00:01:11.100> when<00:01:11.670> you

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
going to wake those sensors up when you

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.550 
going to wake those sensors up when you
swap<00:01:12.030> them<00:01:12.150> out<00:01:12.330> you<00:01:12.780> can<00:01:12.810> either<00:01:13.049> use<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.290> VC

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
swap them out you can either use the VC

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.539 
swap them out you can either use the VC
15<00:01:13.950> or<00:01:14.939> the<00:01:15.540> VT<00:01:15.840> 30<00:01:16.170> okay<00:01:16.619> I<00:01:16.830> won't<00:01:17.159> get<00:01:17.310> into

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
15 or the VT 30 okay I won't get into

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.850 
15 or the VT 30 okay I won't get into
how<00:01:18.240> these<00:01:18.479> work<00:01:18.869> or<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:19.320> differences<00:01:19.710> in

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
how these work or the differences in

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.200 
how these work or the differences in
them<00:01:19.979> because<00:01:20.280> we've<00:01:20.400> got<00:01:20.520> videos<00:01:20.850> for<00:01:21.060> both

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
them because we've got videos for both

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.289 
them because we've got videos for both
okay<00:01:21.570> so<00:01:21.630> if<00:01:21.780> you<00:01:22.229> google<00:01:22.560> a<00:01:22.590> tech<00:01:22.799> VT<00:01:23.130> 15<00:01:23.580> or<00:01:23.820> VT

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
okay so if you google a tech VT 15 or VT

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.270 
okay so if you google a tech VT 15 or VT
30<00:01:24.659> you'll<00:01:25.259> see<00:01:25.500> the<00:01:25.650> video<00:01:25.770> that<00:01:25.920> should<00:01:26.189> be

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
30 you'll see the video that should be

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.340 
30 you'll see the video that should be
exactly<00:01:26.670> how<00:01:26.909> to<00:01:26.970> use<00:01:27.060> a<00:01:27.150> tool<00:01:27.390> and<00:01:27.720> also

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
exactly how to use a tool and also

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.859 
exactly how to use a tool and also
specific<00:01:28.860> video<00:01:29.130> that<00:01:29.340> details<00:01:29.520> and<00:01:30.090> outlines

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
specific video that details and outlines

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.719 
specific video that details and outlines
what<00:01:31.439> the<00:01:31.619> differences<00:01:32.189> are<00:01:32.310> between<00:01:32.460> the<00:01:32.700> two

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
what the differences are between the two

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.480 
what the differences are between the two
but<00:01:33.329> if<00:01:33.450> both<00:01:33.600> going<00:01:33.869> to<00:01:33.930> work<00:01:34.049> for<00:01:34.259> you<00:01:34.350> guys

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:34.490 
but if both going to work for you guys

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.149 
but if both going to work for you guys
but<00:01:35.490> one<00:01:35.729> these<00:01:36.570> specifically<00:01:37.140> the<00:01:37.290> bg-30<00:01:37.710> has

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
but one these specifically the bg-30 has

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.120 
but one these specifically the bg-30 has
some<00:01:38.820> features<00:01:39.570> of<00:01:39.600> the<00:01:39.750> VT<00:01:39.990> 15<00:01:40.350> is<00:01:40.500> not<00:01:40.650> okay

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
some features of the VT 15 is not okay

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.380 
some features of the VT 15 is not okay
and<00:01:41.460> you<00:01:41.549> can<00:01:41.670> decide<00:01:41.939> whether<00:01:42.180> you<00:01:42.360> need

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
and you can decide whether you need

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.679 
and you can decide whether you need
those<00:01:42.780> or<00:01:42.960> not<00:01:43.680> but<00:01:43.979> either<00:01:44.220> way<00:01:45.149> you<00:01:45.570> could

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
those or not but either way you could

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.560 
those or not but either way you could
