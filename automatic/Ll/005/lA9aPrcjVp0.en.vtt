00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.280
 dear and welcome to this new video 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.809
 on the juan canal 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.600
 then this will be a video 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.490
 relatively short where I will show you 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:23.609
 my apples how to unlock the mythical gold 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:26.849
 in black ops 2 and also secret america 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:29.130
 diamond then we leave immediately to go 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.720
 on create a class I forgot 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.460
 to turn on the joystick of course 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.950
 so when braking if I do a 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.160
 example the sniper because in to be 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.550
 50 already unlocked a gold camouflage 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.680
 practically then the camouflage 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.420
 so every metric is a challenge 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.360
 as you can see this here and the first 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.460
 de brun I know how to pronounce e 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.930
 you had to make five medals a shot 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:55.320
 dead then kill an enemy with a 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:57.600
 shot then 10 25 50 75 and 100 150 and 200 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.300
 when he lived from 200 unlockable ethics 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:03.239
 crypt iphone purely once 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.850
 arrived the mythical triple cryptex tyson 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.530
 sorry to unblock stevo but that's not it 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.350
 The unlockables are not that you could use them 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.030
 you had to appear the challenges for 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.979
 example, keep tenths from companies to 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.299
 risk that I didn't want to say c 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:18.000
 how much there is to talk about but to be 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.470
 50 and without any accessory or 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.030
 there was this here with none 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.930
 so we had to do something special 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.600
 remove the bonuses 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.670
 in short, completing all the challenges of 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.740
 all averages therefore having available 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.600
 all the camouflage will then unlock the 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.100
 camouflage I did as you can see there is 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.070
 written unlocks all camouflages for 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.570
 to be 50 for the diamond camouflage is 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:40.110
 a little different thing in fact you will have to 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.890
 unlock all the goes to all the rifles 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.020
 of one category each I take as 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:45.190
 as an example sniper rifle here 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.830
 they are sniper rifles 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:50.800
 here if you want to unlock the camouflage now 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:53.470
 this being 50 dances if these xpr 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:55.360
 50 you have unlocked everyone will appear 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:57.580
 automatically this diamond metric 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:00.009
 this applies to the rifles category of 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:02.890
 precision with light machine guns 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:05.380
 shotguns and assault rifles e 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:07.390
 so it is also a very thing 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.399
 interesting the gold camouflage also for i 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:10.600
 points and b damage in fact you want to get me 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:11.440
 the diamond camouflage on guns e 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.390
 precision 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:15.730
 so I'm trying to do this for 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:18.580
 example here when you unlock this 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:20.620
 strange ethical blood and you'll have to unlock it 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:23.500
 doing get 50 50 medals a 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:25.300
 very shot you will have 2,500 points 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:28.630
 experience and when you arrive from work 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:31.209
 5,000 also these are 2,500 therefore 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:33.100
 this 3500 is really this 5,000 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:35.500
 so they really are a lot of points 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:37.870
 it is worthwhile to unlock the mythical gold for many 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:40.000
 weapons, however, the thing of camouflage 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:42.790
 of the accessories more or less than eni in the 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.530
 video how to level quickly on call 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:46.030

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:47.290
 what I wanted to say I told you e 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:49.930
