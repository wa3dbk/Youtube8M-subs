this<00:00:36.960> is<00:00:37.079> better<00:00:37.320> than<00:00:37.500> popcorn<00:00:37.800> time<00:00:38.219> is<00:00:38.460> that

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
this is better than popcorn time is that

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.100 
this is better than popcorn time is that
popcorn<00:00:39.480> time<00:00:39.989> is<00:00:40.290> based<00:00:40.649> on<00:00:40.829> Torrance<00:00:41.370> and

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:42.110 
popcorn time is based on Torrance and

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:45.170 
popcorn time is based on Torrance and
you<00:00:43.110> know<00:00:43.230> you<00:00:43.290> have<00:00:43.559> to<00:00:43.680> have<00:00:43.770> cedars<00:00:44.309> and<00:00:44.579> the

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
you know you have to have cedars and the

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.790 
you know you have to have cedars and the
more<00:00:45.360> cedars<00:00:45.660> you<00:00:45.750> have<00:00:45.930> the<00:00:46.410> quicker<00:00:46.649> the

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
more cedars you have the quicker the

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.369 
more cedars you have the quicker the
connection<00:00:47.190> is<00:00:47.340> and<00:00:47.550> all<00:00:47.670> that<00:00:47.719> this<00:00:48.719> wine<00:00:49.110> is

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
connection is and all that this wine is

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.470 
connection is and all that this wine is
not<00:00:49.950> using<00:00:50.309> Torrance<00:00:50.640> it's<00:00:50.820> actually<00:00:51.120> using

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
not using Torrance it's actually using

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.069 
not using Torrance it's actually using
servers<00:00:52.170> and<00:00:52.770> the<00:00:53.520> servers<00:00:53.910> I<00:00:54.300> think<00:00:54.780> some<00:00:55.050> of

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
servers and the servers I think some of

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:56.840 
servers and the servers I think some of
them<00:00:55.260> are<00:00:55.410> mirrors<00:00:55.770> but<00:00:56.010> they<00:00:56.520> do<00:00:56.579> have

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
them are mirrors but they do have

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.060 
them are mirrors but they do have
different<00:00:57.180> qualities<00:00:57.480> like<00:00:57.600> HD<00:00:57.809> standard<00:00:58.590> and

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
different qualities like HD standard and

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.979 
different qualities like HD standard and
even<00:00:59.370> cam<00:00:59.789> if<00:01:00.030> it's<00:01:00.180> like<00:01:00.300> a<00:01:00.329> new<00:01:00.510> release<00:01:00.780> or

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
even cam if it's like a new release or

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.840 
even cam if it's like a new release or
something<00:01:01.230> that<00:01:01.350> but<00:01:02.190> that's<00:01:02.340> why<00:01:02.430> I<00:01:02.460> like<00:01:02.699> it

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
something that but that's why I like it

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.090 
something that but that's why I like it
it's<00:01:02.969> not<00:01:03.120> based<00:01:03.510> on<00:01:03.719> you<00:01:04.439> know<00:01:04.470> Cedars<00:01:05.070> and

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
it's not based on you know Cedars and

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.100 
it's not based on you know Cedars and
all<00:01:05.430> that<00:01:05.670> as<00:01:05.939> bullshit<00:01:06.510> it's<00:01:06.659> too<00:01:06.840> slow

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
all that as bullshit it's too slow

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.969 
all that as bullshit it's too slow
alright<00:01:07.290> so<00:01:08.040> this<00:01:08.340> one<00:01:09.140> is<00:01:10.140> way<00:01:10.619> better<00:01:10.830> than

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
alright so this one is way better than

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.520 
alright so this one is way better than
popcorn<00:01:11.250> time<00:01:11.670> in<00:01:11.880> my<00:01:12.000> opinion<00:01:12.390> and<00:01:12.600> if<00:01:13.439> you

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530

something else let's say this standard

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:02.290 
something else let's say this standard
def<00:03:58.070> here<00:03:58.340> and<00:04:00.550> we'll<00:04:01.550> select<00:04:01.700> another<00:04:01.970> server

and<00:04:02.630> it<00:04:03.320> should<00:04:03.709> go

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:05.630 
and it should go

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:08.620 
and it should go
it<00:04:05.990> takes<00:04:06.230> up<00:04:06.380> maybe<00:04:06.590> a<00:04:07.040> few<00:04:07.760> seconds<00:04:08.209> for<00:04:08.570> the

it takes up maybe a few seconds for the
initial<00:04:09.140> and<00:04:09.380> then<00:04:09.470> after<00:04:09.770> that<00:04:09.890> it's<00:04:10.130> just

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:10.190 
initial and then after that it's just
