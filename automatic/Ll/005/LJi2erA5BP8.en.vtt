00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:23.960
 hello my name is nastya hour today 

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:25.940
 I want to prepare a smoothie with you on 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.490
 very very simple recipe and where 

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:30.080
 this recipe is very unusual I hope 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:32.120
 that I will have something so let's 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:35.080
 already start to prepare from puz you 

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:38.450
 museum we will need a blender knife and 

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:40.610
 a glass that you can then cut well 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:42.920
 and accordingly we will need a watermelon and 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:45.530
 first we need to chart 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:50.379
 hole we need such a fool to 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:50.379
 us in the forest itself blend cut this hole 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.480
 and now the coolest part we have to 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.480
 make smoothies understood in the watermelon itself 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.480
 go 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:33.410
 these next action can do this 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:35.930
 hole here and the thing is that we 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:37.490
 a glass is much bigger so I tell you 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:40.610
 I recommend to take an ordinary plastic 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:43.070
 white glass so we had as if 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:45.020
 would have a bottle neck so first we 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:46.760
 we will make a hole here and then 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:49.240
 let's see yes cut restaurant 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:49.240
 in half 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:08.360
 van etten api 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.360
 in the evening 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:18.760
 will go 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:21.140
 ready to remove all the excess so as not to 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:23.140
 hit our smoothie 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.140
 about 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:44.730
 that's smoothie ready 

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:47.040
 sample spoon that's all the smoothie is ready 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:50.040
 principle this is a cool way i think that 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:53.069
 one watermelon can be used for this 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:55.019
