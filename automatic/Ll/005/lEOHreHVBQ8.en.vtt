00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.520
 good these fears to a new video 

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:05.749
 really news that is to go off and 

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:07.009
 it is not for less 

00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:09.470
 I really believe that there are people who do not 

00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:11.660
 He thinks his whores words when he says 

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:14.690
 or I think they do not think very well in all 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:16.129
 the people who are hurting in with 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:20.900
 those words I do not think it's that your 

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:22.640
 mental symbolism is your malnutrition the 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.869
 brain that they have to have or be 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.820
 they have to have a brain type 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:27.890
 Unclean uncle of those who do not know 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:30.769
 feeds with nothing basically not 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:33.559
 they think and they do not think and it's good 

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:34.910
 basically a presenter of the cbs a 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:36.920
 pretty american chain 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:38.300
 important because it is said that good 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.219
 recommends gamers to go 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.809
 playing the real world is not saying no 

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:43.530
 understands the purchase the acquisition of 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:45.719
 amazon 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.699
 in the acquisition of tweets by 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.860
 amazon de sergio in the buy with a 

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:52.019
 quite high money that surely 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.210
 will recover obviously since it is a 

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:56.940
 quite emerging market that does not stop 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.980
 to grow up and well that does not understand that yes 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:02.460
 If the lice are boring they are a 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:04.649
 waste of time in addition to it you can 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.229
 see it then it seems the same loss 

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:08.549
 of time and money and so on 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.500
 also that it is lots because they are 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.330
 electronic sports also 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.220
 annoy this good guy then also 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.289
 Now therefore it ensures good not 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.539
 they have a social life that is bitter 

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:20.429
 they waste their lives of everything not by 

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:22.530
 summarize it a little bit, not because the 

00:01:20.429 --> 00:01:24.479
 nonsense and the bullshit you want 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.159
 say this man by mouth are so 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.140
 spacious that is awesome I do not know how 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.340
 they have left to say this on TV no 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.810
 they would have let this say for the 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.060
 tele for the following reason to many of 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.069
 you may seem like a loss of 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.869
 time not to play video games see how 

00:01:35.069 --> 00:01:38.100
 others play video games really 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.409
 then you are quite seeing us in 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:43.560
 video on youtube I do not think that really 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:45.090
 think this kind of shit but 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.190
 I really believe that when they say this 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.180
 kind of things do not think that the 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:50.130
 videogames the world of videogames 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:54.270
 Raise more money than in movies 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:55.710
 money that the music that are 22 the 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.149
 factors important enough nodes 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.460
 industry going on important in the 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.659
 word I wanted to say 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.899
 and what do you mean by this basically 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:05.179
 that are harming from the 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:07.409
 largest video game developer 

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:09.300
 to the store in our neighborhood 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:11.250
 smaller game does not really this guy 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.220
 of this kind of people do not know what is 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:16.860
 harming another much more people 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:18.720
 humble and rich we are not going to put on all 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.640
 the factors and above all humble not 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.950
 many video game distributors 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.560
 normal people what has to be distributed 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.569
 things good to imagine if the world of 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.220
 video game raised so much money is 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:30.150
 because there's a lot of work behind him if 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.250
 we re make the world of 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.480
 video games directly the people who are 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.459
 would be unemployed people who do not 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.980
 would have work would be awesome and 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:39.660
 you want to eat is this fucking people this 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:42.209
 bitch who says that videogames 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:44.489
 they are shit, they seem more to me 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:47.610
 shit to see an informative where almost 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:51.090
 everything is manipulated surely 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:53.670
 because it will be super manipulated really 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:55.230
 that guy from the informative never say the 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.069
 truth also it seems that never says the 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.930
 true 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:01.780
 in these kinds of chains really that 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:05.680
 they are super-agreed with the government that 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:07.900
 they are really bought and more if they are 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.909
 trash not the end of the day really are 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:11.829
 what I think is junk or have to do 

00:03:09.909 --> 00:03:13.540
 that this one has died that the other has killed 

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:15.340
 I do not know who is in a war of no 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.959
 I know how many, I prefer to see the one 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:19.090
 playing video games and having fun is the 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:20.920
 more peaceful I do not know how to call myself crazy 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:23.319
 fuck but fuck I prefer that I prefer 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.790
 a thousand times before listening to this piece 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:27.549
 of shit to say this kind of nonsense 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:29.620
 because he does not think with the fucking head to the 

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:31.599
 people who are really hurting what 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:33.159
 that is behind all this gives me 

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:35.650
 just as suddenly they stop seeing me and 

00:03:33.159 --> 00:03:37.299
 it's boring to see the old man now 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:38.709
 game is not boring to watch would 

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:42.549
 play video games what your location 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:44.379
 that's really what happened the most 

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:46.689
 day we could say not to watch videos of 

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:48.549
 tec in and things doing what unites with 

00:03:46.689 --> 00:03:50.230
 entertain even watching programs 

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:52.299
 television and others that also 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:53.739
 entertains in a few years and no joke in 

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:56.049
 television is not boring because it's going to 

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:57.879
 be someone someone playing video games 

00:03:56.049 --> 00:04:01.060
 is that they do not have any damn fucking 

00:03:57.879 --> 00:04:02.650
 meaning to the truth that is this kind of 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:04.660
 that kind of people I true 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:06.280
 it would disappear from television because 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:08.459
 she is work not especially these people 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:11.440
 that it seems to be so purchased 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:13.030
 I could disappear because they say magic 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:14.709
 nonsense by the mouth that the public 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:16.720
 wants to listen because in the USA I do not know what 

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:18.489
 They have against video games 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:20.889
 is impressive of all the means that 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:22.840
 they really throw shit in shit and 

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:26.440
 shit I do not really know that much audience 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:29.050
 they have it removed to this kind of people 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:32.169
 so that they release so much shit 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:33.970
 here in Spain not so much garbage is released 

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:36.070
 world the video games in fact already 

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:37.990
 are beginning to deploy on sites 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:40.660
 you just have to look for example in the 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:43.150
 trivote v not me where a section that 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:44.710
 I have there as a gamer and many more 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:46.540
 I think it's good that the betting TV 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:49.000
 for the world of video games is something 

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:51.160
 quite important I think that instead 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.110
 to throw him shit you have to join him and 

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:55.990
 it is already if you see that it steals hearing 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:57.580
 fangled join it is the best you can 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:59.770
 do and do not steal audience because 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:01.690
 because people are in bad shape 

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:04.030
 will be stealing audience because it is 

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:05.229
 a good thing and you are not using 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:07.120
 in a certain sense and then it is not 

00:05:05.229 --> 00:05:08.680
 use it 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:09.669
 chain for other programs and others 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:12.040
 throwing shit does not work for 

00:05:09.669 --> 00:05:13.690
 absolutely nothing so nothing else 

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:16.560
 kids this has been all in the next 

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:16.560
 video will be next
