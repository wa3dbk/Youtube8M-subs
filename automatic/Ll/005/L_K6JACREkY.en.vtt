one other show I said okay let's see
what<00:01:20.549> we<00:01:20.670> could<00:01:20.790> do<00:01:20.970> that<00:01:21.210> was<00:01:21.450> not<00:01:21.659> done<00:01:21.840> I

what we could do that was not done I

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.889 
what we could do that was not done I
started<00:01:23.700> from<00:01:23.820> the<00:01:23.880> set<00:01:24.180> we<00:01:24.479> always<00:01:24.630> start

00:01:24.889 --> 00:01:24.899 
started from the set we always start

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:27.200 
started from the set we always start
from<00:01:25.020> the<00:01:25.200> set<00:01:25.409> and<00:01:25.710> get<00:01:26.340> that<00:01:26.520> all<00:01:26.729> squared

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
from the set and get that all squared

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.490 
from the set and get that all squared
away<00:01:27.420> first<00:01:27.690> once<00:01:27.990> we<00:01:28.110> were<00:01:28.229> firmly

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
away first once we were firmly

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.380 
away first once we were firmly
established<00:01:29.100> in<00:01:29.250> Times<00:01:29.460> Square<00:01:29.610> then<00:01:30.000> I<00:01:30.119> could

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
established in Times Square then I could

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.060 
established in Times Square then I could

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
take the people in Times Square and turn

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:38.419 
take the people in Times Square and turn
them<00:01:32.250> into<00:01:32.280> characters<00:01:36.560> we<00:01:37.560> started<00:01:38.159> with<00:01:38.310> the

00:01:38.419 --> 00:01:38.429 
them into characters we started with the

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:42.139 
them into characters we started with the
idea<00:01:38.729> of<00:01:38.789> those<00:01:39.179> ads<00:01:39.509> and<00:01:40.190> having<00:01:41.190> as<00:01:41.490> much<00:01:41.819> ads

00:01:42.139 --> 00:01:42.149 
idea of those ads and having as much ads

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:45.380 
idea of those ads and having as much ads
as<00:01:42.569> possible<00:01:43.200> close<00:01:43.619> to<00:01:43.979> the<00:01:44.130> ring<00:01:44.340> even<00:01:44.909> in

as possible close to the ring even in

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.570 
as possible close to the ring even in
during<00:01:45.840> this<00:01:46.619> time<00:01:46.890> we're<00:01:47.069> having<00:01:47.130> the<00:01:47.340> band

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
either side of the bandstand so that

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.109 
either side of the bandstand so that
they're<00:01:52.350> actually<00:01:52.500> two<00:01:52.920> shoots<00:01:53.490> that<00:01:53.759> come<00:01:53.940> in

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
they're actually two shoots that come in

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.749 
they're actually two shoots that come in
and<00:01:54.300> we<00:01:55.020> immediately<00:01:55.770> latched<00:01:56.100> on<00:01:56.369> to<00:01:56.399> that<00:01:56.640> if

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
and we immediately latched on to that if

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.219 
and we immediately latched on to that if
we<00:01:56.850> were<00:01:56.970> in<00:01:57.000> Times<00:01:57.300> Square<00:01:57.390> and<00:01:57.569> we<00:01:57.690> think<00:01:57.869> why
