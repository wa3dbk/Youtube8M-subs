00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
megapixel the spike on one log are there

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.950 
megapixel the spike on one log are there
which<00:02:04.890> looks<00:02:05.070> pretty<00:02:05.430> awesome<00:02:05.840> down<00:02:06.840> the

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
sides again just visit their design in

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.500 
sides again just visit their design in
california<00:02:10.129> so<00:02:11.129> basically<00:02:11.760> you're<00:02:12.209> thinking

that<00:02:46.720> let's<00:02:47.049> see<00:02:47.170> how<00:02:47.230> you<00:02:47.349> install<00:02:47.530> it<00:02:47.680> in

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:47.829 
that let's see how you install it in

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:49.650 
that let's see how you install it in
that<00:02:47.950> walk<00:02:48.160> install<00:02:48.489> the<00:02:48.519> phone<00:02:48.760> in<00:02:48.880> it<00:02:49.000> so

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:49.660 
that walk install the phone in it so

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:51.420 
that walk install the phone in it so
here<00:02:49.810> it<00:02:49.930> is<00:02:49.959> so<00:02:50.500> obviously<00:02:50.739> is<00:02:50.890> the<00:02:50.950> actual<00:02:51.250> go

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
here it is so obviously is the actual go

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:53.970 
here it is so obviously is the actual go
it's<00:02:52.360> actually<00:02:52.450> TPU<00:02:53.200> is<00:02:53.349> this<00:02:53.470> one<00:02:53.680> so<00:02:53.709> it's

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
it's actually TPU is this one so it's

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:57.089 
it's actually TPU is this one so it's
not<00:02:54.099> a<00:02:54.160> silica<00:02:54.610> unlike<00:02:54.880> the<00:02:55.000> previous<00:02:55.150> ones<00:02:56.099> so

00:02:57.089 --> 00:02:57.099 
not a silica unlike the previous ones so

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:01.559 
not a silica unlike the previous ones so
best<00:02:57.489> is<00:02:57.579> pops<00:02:57.849> in<00:02:58.140> crib<00:02:59.140> solver<00:02:59.730> job<00:03:00.730> done<00:03:00.940> and

00:03:01.559 --> 00:03:01.569 
best is pops in crib solver job done and

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:03.300 
best is pops in crib solver job done and
that's<00:03:01.660> it<00:03:01.900> it's<00:03:02.019> now<00:03:02.110> in<00:03:02.260> there<00:03:02.470> so<00:03:03.040> what

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310 
that's it it's now in there so what

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:04.589 
that's it it's now in there so what
we'll<00:03:03.430> do<00:03:03.549> now<00:03:03.700> is<00:03:03.730> actually<00:03:03.940> put<00:03:04.180> the<00:03:04.269> second

00:03:04.589 --> 00:03:04.599 
we'll do now is actually put the second

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:06.600 
we'll do now is actually put the second
part<00:03:04.780> of<00:03:04.840> the<00:03:04.900> case<00:03:05.079> on<00:03:05.260> it<00:03:05.410> and<00:03:05.769> this<00:03:06.250> is<00:03:06.400> bitch

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:06.610 
part of the case on it and this is bitch

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:07.650 
part of the case on it and this is bitch
it<00:03:06.790> just<00:03:06.940> kind<00:03:07.120> of<00:03:07.180> give<00:03:07.390> it<00:03:07.480> you<00:03:07.540> know<00:03:07.599> i'll

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:07.660 
it just kind of give it you know i'll

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:09.780 
it just kind of give it you know i'll

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790 
give it a nice look but at the same time

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:12.000 
give it a nice look but at the same time
keep<00:03:10.120> all<00:03:10.329> together<00:03:10.510> so<00:03:11.290> easiest<00:03:11.620> way<00:03:11.709> i<00:03:11.739> find

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
keep all together so easiest way i find

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:13.460 
keep all together so easiest way i find
to<00:03:12.069> do<00:03:12.190> its<00:03:12.310> kind<00:03:12.400> of<00:03:12.519> do<00:03:12.640> the<00:03:12.760> top<00:03:12.910> part<00:03:13.180> first

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
to do its kind of do the top part first

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:16.440 
to do its kind of do the top part first
so<00:03:14.470> just<00:03:14.620> kind<00:03:14.769> of<00:03:14.829> clip<00:03:15.010> it<00:03:15.160> over<00:03:15.489> and<00:03:16.269> then<00:03:16.299> as

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:16.450 
so just kind of clip it over and then as

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:20.129 
so just kind of clip it over and then as
you<00:03:16.480> go<00:03:16.720> down<00:03:16.959> just<00:03:17.530> pull<00:03:17.799> it<00:03:17.889> over<00:03:19.019> you<00:03:20.019> can

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:20.139 
you go down just pull it over you can

00:03:20.139 --> 00:03:22.199 
you go down just pull it over you can

put on it was very very very very very
very<00:03:36.150> sensitive<00:03:37.150> so<00:03:37.780> in<00:03:37.900> my<00:03:38.019> pocket<00:03:38.349> the

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:38.440 
very sensitive so in my pocket the

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:40.379 
very sensitive so in my pocket the

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:00.400 
thunders have used TPU for this one so

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:03.000 
thunders have used TPU for this one so
that's<00:05:00.850> like<00:05:01.120> what's<00:05:01.630> ugh<00:05:01.960> because<00:05:02.470> it<00:05:02.620> target

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:03.010 
that's like what's ugh because it target

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:04.410 
that's like what's ugh because it target
it<00:05:03.130> will<00:05:03.190> get<00:05:03.370> hot<00:05:03.610> of<00:05:03.700> us<00:05:03.850> if<00:05:04.000> you<00:05:04.120> compute

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:04.420 
it will get hot of us if you compute

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:07.200 
it will get hot of us if you compute
warms<00:05:04.750> up<00:05:04.930> but<00:05:05.470> in<00:05:05.560> what<00:05:05.770> kind<00:05:06.010> of<00:05:06.070> your<00:05:06.220> change

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:07.210 
warms up but in what kind of your change

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:09.060 
warms up but in what kind of your change
shape<00:05:07.510> and<00:05:07.690> whatnot<00:05:08.020> so<00:05:08.530> you<00:05:08.620> can<00:05:08.770> have<00:05:08.860> nice

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:09.070
