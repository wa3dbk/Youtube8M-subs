00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:12.889
 Online ball and 10 and washed the ball 'that 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:16.949
 Come on down, Boliqueime, and that's it. 

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:20.100
 I'll post a cruel mode here for you. 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:23.550
 cool there for those who want to make some videos 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:26.220
 there with effects in slow motion 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.330
 I had edited it this way for me 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.570
 so I can do some 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.070
 demonstrations on those weapons 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:33.090
 that was being posted by the 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.640
 mold mix 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.350
 So I'm going to post a cyclone here. 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.140
 like a slow motion né 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.629
 He is very reminiscent of that one. 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.149
 michael skill gta5 side but no 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.550
 It's the skill I just edited for whoever 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:50.219
 you really want to do something that 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.050
 moves and can be very useful which is the 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:55.020
 slow motion effect 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.780
 you just hit the key, I'll see 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:01.039
 Press here it's all in slow motion 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:04.500
 watch everyone walk 

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:07.439
 then after a while a few seconds there 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:12.150
 in 10 seconds I think I never told him 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:15.090
 back to normal slow motion 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:17.759
 if you have many cléo templates a 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:20.759
 Save the game bichado it could be that he 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:22.680
 Turn it off at the same time, but 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:26.100
 then press the view key again and 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.650
 active again I'll try to hit someone 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.570
 here o 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:32.310
 they have deactivated a much longer period 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.920
 It's fast that my save game is 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:41.729
 optical patch again to think about 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:44.240
 raise him or her semira and active in 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.240
 slow motion 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:51.560
 if you do not have much skromov it will 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.560
 work well 

00:01:53.969 --> 00:02:07.979
 Semira the active button to see the time and 

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:11.799
 never does it turn off is it even natural 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:15.670
 Due to many cléo molds but tael 

00:02:11.799 --> 00:02:16.690
 anyone who wants a slow camera mold 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:19.330
 motion 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:23.370
 I'll put there will hit in slow motion 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:23.370
 there're nice island was 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:17.650
 This is it, people, beauty. 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:39.910
 ae 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:55.440
 always stay by pressing the see key 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:55.440
 until attila mira active was already
