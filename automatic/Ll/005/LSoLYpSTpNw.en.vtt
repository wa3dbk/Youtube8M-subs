00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.840 
means selling them of this car and we
have<00:03:41.660> so<00:03:42.050> much<00:03:42.230> power<00:03:42.620> that<00:03:43.040> it's<00:03:43.430> almost<00:03:43.610> hard

have so much power that it's almost hard
to<00:03:44.060> comprehend<00:03:44.630> it's<00:03:44.810> like<00:03:44.960> when<00:03:45.110> you're

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:45.230 
to comprehend it's like when you're

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:47.530

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:53.450 
comprehend the size of it because it's

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:56.110
