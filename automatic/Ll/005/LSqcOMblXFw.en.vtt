00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:08.639
 xbox one ips 4 get ready because 2014 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.620
 it has only been an appetizer it seems that 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:13.080
 we will have gears of war disco nor and 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.969
 some more on the shelves next to 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.550
 these inscribed victory and editions 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.619
 Improved project cast soy eva white 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.640
 and here begins your del and fix of 11 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.640
 May 2015 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:29.560
 from ubisoft they have rushed to launch 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:31.840
 a viral campaign so that they are not 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:33.820
 ahead of anyone that the e3 is very 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:36.190
 close and this gets interesting and 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:39.280
 what is the game that we will see tomorrow 12 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:41.530
 May then who says that watch top 2 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:43.510
 it may not be misguided but 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:45.850
 that is for a privileged few 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:47.739
 if tomorrow is taught what 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:49.720
 we will see the rest of the mortals will be the 

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:51.640
 official presentation of the new 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:53.320
 assassin's creed supposedly called 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.300
 vÃ­ctor and if there are no last changes 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:57.430
 hour and set in a london 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:00.699
 Victorian increasingly are over 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:03.040
 fashion will include quatermain the doctor 

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:06.130
 frankenstein or dorian gray among the 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:08.590
 secondary would not be bad a league of 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:12.030
 the extraordinary killers but well 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:14.619
 made to be like that, take my money job and 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:17.020
 as is tradition in microsoft it 

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:18.909
 they keep the ads for the e3 is their 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.799
 favorite fair and where they present the 

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:22.689
 releases for its 12 months 

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:25.060
 following which includes the year in 

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:26.890
 course and spring too so 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:28.960
 As one month is missing for the fair, 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:31.780
 we can let the rumors and 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:34.260
 custom announcements like hunger 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:36.690
 war ultimate edition final edition 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:38.920
 edition you are interested in one of the two 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:41.080
 we are left with the saga of 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:43.930
 marcus phoenix that she looked fancy 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:46.330
 in xbox 360 and it would not hurt to go back 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:49.690
 for those who do not know the locus or the 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:51.250
 based multiplayer chainsaws and if 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:53.740
 they have dedicated servers and the 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:56.140
 games equal the thing would improve a lot 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:59.259
 especially in the face of having a script 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:02.830
 world 4 by the end of 2016 because that 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:04.600
 is the plan true microsoft idiso no no 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:06.940
 you would play it again in version 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.649
 improved it's worth that you have it started with 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:11.410
 game edition of the year and many 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:13.360
 add-ons but if you're from console to 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:15.340
 the best you call but in any case 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.590
 it seems that gears of war has the 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.450
 triumph for those generations that do not 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:21.519
 they were old to see dismemberments 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:25.030
 when the locus came out of their 

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:26.830
 holes the arrival of project house xbox 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:29.260
 one has been marked by being left behind 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:31.390
 in screen resolution and smoothness 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:33.580
 also for not including lobbies for 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:35.470
 meet with friends online with what 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:37.840
 the games force us to play against 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:39.250
 unknown in many cases 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.680
 solve and for this mess 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:43.209
 Who are the responsible ones? 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.489
 it's not a matter of looking for guilty 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:48.819
 but in slightly mad studios they point 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:51.040
 to microsoft for something will be though all 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:52.690
 has a solution apparently because the 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.849
 goal was to get to stores in the 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:56.290
 date marked without further delay 

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:59.049
 hence, a 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:00.610
 patch to project in xbox one with the 

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:03.250
 up target performance between 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:05.140
 4 and 7 percent as well as improve 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:07.420
 the subject of controls and with the 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:09.040
 hope that they can activate the 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:11.590
 previous rooms to meet with friends 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:14.410
 in xbox live that the microsoft console 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:17.349
 it depends on the system itself and its famous 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:19.150
 cloud as we have two releases of 

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:20.739
 those that mark the season we could not 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:23.620
 miss the opportunity 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:25.780
 we want you to participate in the engineer 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:28.209
