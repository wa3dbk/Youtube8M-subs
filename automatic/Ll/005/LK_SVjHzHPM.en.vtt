side of the actual crisping tray well

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:49.780 
side of the actual crisping tray well
that's<00:01:48.770> nice<00:01:49.010> you<00:01:49.220> know<00:01:49.310> it's<00:01:49.460> nice<00:01:49.549> and

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:49.790 
that's nice you know it's nice and

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:51.730 
that's nice you know it's nice and
compact<00:01:50.210> and<00:01:50.479> you<00:01:50.630> know<00:01:50.750> it's<00:01:50.900> safe<00:01:51.080> space<00:01:51.470> and

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:51.740 
compact and you know it's safe space and

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:53.500 
compact and you know it's safe space and
maybe<00:01:51.830> it<00:01:51.979> reduces<00:01:52.340> packaging<00:01:52.790> cost<00:01:53.000> the

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:53.510 
maybe it reduces packaging cost the

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:54.820 
maybe it reduces packaging cost the
problem<00:01:53.900> is<00:01:54.020> when<00:01:54.200> you<00:01:54.260> take<00:01:54.470> that<00:01:54.620> out<00:01:54.799> and

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:54.830 
problem is when you take that out and

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:59.410 
problem is when you take that out and
you<00:01:55.070> flip<00:01:55.670> the<00:01:55.970> tray<00:01:56.320> crumbs<00:01:57.320> everywhere<00:01:58.420> now

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 
you flip the tray crumbs everywhere now

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:01.000 
you flip the tray crumbs everywhere now
I<00:01:59.479> don't<00:01:59.630> know<00:01:59.780> if<00:01:59.869> you<00:01:59.990> care<00:02:00.229> about<00:02:00.619> that<00:02:00.799> if
