certain amount of light through it'll

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.880 
certain amount of light through it'll
bounce<00:01:53.670> the<00:01:54.060> light<00:01:54.090> up<00:01:54.450> it<00:01:54.899> will<00:01:55.140> control<00:01:55.649> the

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
so that you can take the second one and

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.350 
so that you can take the second one and
put<00:02:04.500> the<00:02:04.619> second<00:02:05.009> one<00:02:05.100> on<00:02:05.130> with<00:02:05.729> the<00:02:05.939> first<00:02:06.149> one

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:42.850 
pick the diffusion because the strengths

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:44.910 
pick the diffusion because the strengths
are<00:02:42.970> different<00:02:43.330> remember<00:02:43.750> tab<00:02:43.990> one<00:02:44.290> tab<00:02:44.650> to
