couldn't find any good tabs this song
really<00:00:08.880> online<00:00:09.360> so<00:00:10.349> I<00:00:10.410> had<00:00:10.769> to<00:00:10.980> hear<00:00:11.340> it<00:00:11.490> out

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
really online so I had to hear it out

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.020 
really online so I had to hear it out
and<00:00:12.290> I<00:00:13.290> think<00:00:14.190> it<00:00:14.340> turned<00:00:14.519> out<00:00:14.700> pretty<00:00:14.759> well

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
and I think it turned out pretty well

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.390 
and I think it turned out pretty well
actually<00:00:15.360> I<00:00:15.599> listened<00:00:16.109> to<00:00:16.139> a<00:00:16.650> live<00:00:17.070> studio

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
actually I listened to a live studio

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.679 
actually I listened to a live studio
recording<00:00:18.090> there's<00:00:18.720> a<00:00:18.779> video<00:00:19.080> of<00:00:19.230> him<00:00:19.410> playing

00:00:20.679 --> 00:00:20.689 
recording there's a video of him playing

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:26.089 
recording there's a video of him playing
and<00:00:21.689> he<00:00:23.060> slammed<00:00:24.060> a<00:00:24.500> capo<00:00:25.500> up<00:00:25.710> on<00:00:25.830> the<00:00:25.920> fifth

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
and he slammed a capo up on the fifth

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.200 
and he slammed a capo up on the fifth
fret<00:00:26.279> up<00:00:26.460> here<00:00:26.640> and<00:00:28.340> played<00:00:29.340> it<00:00:29.490> like<00:00:29.670> so<00:00:29.970> and

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
fret up here and played it like so and

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.900 
fret up here and played it like so and
this<00:00:30.869> is<00:00:31.050> um<00:00:31.439> the<00:00:31.920> way<00:00:32.040> that<00:00:32.070> I<00:00:32.250> interpret<00:00:32.579> it

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
this is um the way that I interpret it

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.830 
this is um the way that I interpret it
and<00:00:33.200> just<00:00:34.200> so<00:00:34.350> you<00:00:34.410> guys<00:00:34.530> know<00:00:34.590> there's<00:00:35.070> also

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:35.840 
and just so you guys know there's also

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.930 
and just so you guys know there's also
they<00:00:36.840> play<00:00:37.110> it<00:00:37.260> open<00:00:37.500> form<00:00:38.040> in<00:00:38.309> the<00:00:38.489> music

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
they play it open form in the music

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.580 
they play it open form in the music
video<00:00:39.210> so<00:00:39.629> it's<00:00:39.780> a<00:00:39.840> little<00:00:39.989> different<00:00:40.379> and<00:00:40.500> I

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
video so it's a little different and I

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:41.900 
video so it's a little different and I
actually<00:00:40.680> think<00:00:41.129> it<00:00:41.280> sounds<00:00:41.579> a<00:00:41.610> little<00:00:41.700> bit

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
actually think it sounds a little bit

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.970 
actually think it sounds a little bit
better<00:00:42.059> than<00:00:42.239> the<00:00:42.329> music<00:00:42.629> video<00:00:42.899> so<00:00:43.770> if<00:00:43.890> you

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
better than the music video so if you

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.279 
better than the music video so if you
want<00:00:44.160> to<00:00:44.219> learn<00:00:44.370> a<00:00:44.399> more<00:00:44.610> legit<00:00:45.030> version<00:00:45.480> you

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
want to learn a more legit version you

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.350 
want to learn a more legit version you
know<00:00:46.410> and<00:00:46.590> someone<00:00:46.800> wants<00:00:47.160> to<00:00:47.309> learn<00:00:47.820> this<00:00:48.090> and

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
know and someone wants to learn this and

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.180 
know and someone wants to learn this and
then<00:00:48.450> tab<00:00:48.690> that<00:00:48.899> one<00:00:49.050> out<00:00:49.200> that'd<00:00:49.980> be

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
then tab that one out that'd be

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.470 
then tab that one out that'd be
righteous<00:00:50.850> brother<00:00:51.649> so<00:00:52.820> anyways<00:00:53.820> let's<00:00:54.329> get

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
righteous brother so anyways let's get

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.260 
righteous brother so anyways let's get
started<00:00:54.590> the<00:00:55.590> chord<00:00:56.550> progression<00:00:57.059> in<00:00:57.149> this

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
started the chord progression in this

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:05.450 
started the chord progression in this
song<00:00:57.539> is<00:00:57.780> a<00:00:58.649> minor<00:00:58.920> whoo<00:00:59.309> a<00:01:00.000> minor<00:01:00.980> C<00:01:02.030> G<00:01:03.030> D<00:01:04.460> okay

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
song is a minor whoo a minor C G D okay

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.820 
song is a minor whoo a minor C G D okay
and<00:01:05.930> when<00:01:06.930> I<00:01:06.960> was<00:01:07.170> breaking<00:01:07.530> it<00:01:07.650> down<00:01:07.770> I

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
and when I was breaking it down I

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.980 
and when I was breaking it down I
noticed<00:01:08.189> that<00:01:08.460> there's<00:01:08.640> a<00:01:08.700> general<00:01:08.939> kind<00:01:09.840> of

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
noticed that there's a general kind of

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.260 
noticed that there's a general kind of
backbone<00:01:10.439> skeleton<00:01:11.189> to<00:01:11.460> the<00:01:11.549> song<00:01:11.790> and<00:01:12.060> you

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
backbone skeleton to the song and you

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.420 
backbone skeleton to the song and you
can<00:01:12.420> actually<00:01:12.720> play<00:01:13.080> with<00:01:13.110> two<00:01:14.040> plucking

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
can actually play with two plucking

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.469 
can actually play with two plucking
fingers<00:01:14.760> and<00:01:15.000> one<00:01:15.150> in<00:01:15.390> your<00:01:16.049> thumb<00:01:16.310> so<00:01:17.479> start

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
fingers and one in your thumb so start

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.359 
fingers and one in your thumb so start
off<00:01:18.600> by<00:01:18.659> holding<00:01:19.200> your<00:01:19.229> a<00:01:19.530> minor<00:01:19.770> form<00:01:20.100> chord

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
off by holding your a minor form chord

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.359 
off by holding your a minor form chord
and<00:01:20.549> pluck<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:21.810> root<00:01:22.290> note<00:01:22.500> of<00:01:22.680> that<00:01:23.100> chord

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
and pluck the root note of that chord

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.420 
and pluck the root note of that chord
and<00:01:23.790> then<00:01:24.540> with<00:01:25.200> your<00:01:25.439> two<00:01:25.680> fingers<00:01:25.710> at<00:01:26.340> the

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
and then with your two fingers at the

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.580 
and then with your two fingers at the
same<00:01:26.640> time<00:01:26.909> pluck<00:01:27.840> the<00:01:28.049> second<00:01:28.380> and<00:01:28.470> third

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
same time pluck the second and third

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.480 
same time pluck the second and third
strings<00:01:29.180> so<00:01:30.180> it's

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:31.490 
strings so it's

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:34.090 
strings so it's
then<00:01:31.729> there's<00:01:31.909> two<00:01:32.090> hammer-ons<00:01:32.680> so<00:01:33.680> first

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 
then there's two hammer-ons so first

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.399 
then there's two hammer-ons so first
you're<00:01:34.430> going<00:01:34.460> to<00:01:34.579> hammer<00:01:34.850> the<00:01:35.119> third<00:01:35.540> fret<00:01:35.869> of

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:36.409 
you're going to hammer the third fret of

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:39.820 
you're going to hammer the third fret of
the<00:01:36.640> G<00:01:37.640> with<00:01:38.030> your<00:01:38.210> pinky<00:01:38.630> which<00:01:39.439> is<00:01:39.590> a<00:01:39.619> little

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:39.830 
the G with your pinky which is a little

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:42.070 
the G with your pinky which is a little
bit<00:01:39.920> tricky<00:01:40.280> at<00:01:40.640> first<00:01:40.670> but<00:01:41.210> given<00:01:41.899> time

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:42.080 
bit tricky at first but given time

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.889 
bit tricky at first but given time
because<00:01:42.290> you'll<00:01:42.619> get<00:01:42.710> used<00:01:42.890> to<00:01:43.009> it<00:01:43.180> and<00:01:44.180> then

00:01:44.889 --> 00:01:44.899 
because you'll get used to it and then

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:48.700 
because you'll get used to it and then
you<00:01:45.170> hammer<00:01:45.740> the<00:01:46.720> second<00:01:47.720> fret<00:01:47.899> of<00:01:48.110> the<00:01:48.200> fourth

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:48.710 
you hammer the second fret of the fourth

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:51.070 
you hammer the second fret of the fourth
string<00:01:48.799> with<00:01:49.250> your<00:01:49.280> middle<00:01:49.430> finger<00:01:49.960> all<00:01:50.960> right

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:51.080 
string with your middle finger all right

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:57.530 
string with your middle finger all right
so<00:01:52.210> so<00:01:53.210> altogether<00:01:53.659> it<00:01:53.960> sounds<00:01:54.289> like

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.960 

so<00:01:58.540> then<00:01:58.720> you<00:01:58.810> go<00:01:58.900> to<00:01:58.960> the<00:01:59.140> e<00:01:59.170> minor<00:01:59.850> and<00:02:00.850> it's

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:00.970 
so then you go to the e minor and it's

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:03.420 
so then you go to the e minor and it's
essentially<00:02:01.420> the<00:02:01.510> same<00:02:01.540> thing<00:02:01.990> except<00:02:02.500> you

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:03.430 
essentially the same thing except you

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:05.760 
essentially the same thing except you
plug<00:02:03.640> the<00:02:03.790> root<00:02:03.970> note<00:02:04.180> same<00:02:04.840> two<00:02:05.050> strings<00:02:05.410> and

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:05.770 
plug the root note same two strings and

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:09.990 
plug the root note same two strings and
then<00:02:05.980> you<00:02:06.070> hammer<00:02:06.280> on<00:02:06.460> these<00:02:07.180> two<00:02:07.420> fingers<00:02:09.000> so

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 
then you hammer on these two fingers so

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.710 
then you hammer on these two fingers so
it's

I reverse the order right defy the defy

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.620 
I reverse the order right defy the defy
the<00:02:49.100> expectations<00:02:49.850> make<00:02:50.120> the<00:02:50.240> song<00:02:50.420> better

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:28.610 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:34.790 

all<00:03:29.610> right<00:03:30.140> so<00:03:31.220> now<00:03:32.870> if<00:03:33.870> you<00:03:34.110> want<00:03:34.140> to<00:03:34.350> play<00:03:34.530> the

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:34.800 
all right so now if you want to play the

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:38.360 
all right so now if you want to play the
full<00:03:35.580> legit<00:03:36.030> version<00:03:36.390> of<00:03:36.480> the<00:03:36.570> song<00:03:36.780> I<00:03:37.370> think

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
full legit version of the song I think

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:40.790 
full legit version of the song I think
it<00:03:38.490> works<00:03:38.640> best<00:03:38.970> with<00:03:39.210> three<00:03:39.510> fingers<00:03:39.750> and<00:03:40.260> I

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:40.800 
it works best with three fingers and I

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.680 
it works best with three fingers and I
instead<00:03:41.490> of<00:03:41.610> you<00:03:41.730> don't<00:03:42.120> want<00:03:42.390> to<00:03:42.540> actually

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
instead of you don't want to actually

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:45.500 
instead of you don't want to actually
anchor<00:03:43.290> your<00:03:43.560> hand<00:03:44.490> to<00:03:44.850> the<00:03:44.940> guitar<00:03:45.210> with<00:03:45.390> your

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 
anchor your hand to the guitar with your

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:47.660 
anchor your hand to the guitar with your
pinky<00:03:45.870> or<00:03:46.080> at<00:03:46.320> least<00:03:46.530> I<00:03:46.740> think<00:03:47.250> it<00:03:47.490> works

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:47.670 
pinky or at least I think it works

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:49.550 
pinky or at least I think it works
better<00:03:48.210> like<00:03:48.510> this<00:03:48.750> gives<00:03:49.110> you<00:03:49.200> a<00:03:49.260> little<00:03:49.380> more

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
better like this gives you a little more

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.470 
better like this gives you a little more
angle<00:03:49.980> if<00:03:50.130> you<00:03:50.220> just<00:03:50.400> hover<00:03:50.730> your<00:03:50.970> hand<00:03:51.180> over

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480 
angle if you just hover your hand over

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:54.560 
angle if you just hover your hand over
the<00:03:51.570> guitar<00:03:51.690> and<00:03:52.140> you<00:03:53.120> essentially<00:03:54.120> just<00:03:54.360> play

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:54.570 
the guitar and you essentially just play

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:57.170 
the guitar and you essentially just play
just<00:03:54.600> like<00:03:54.990> this<00:03:55.320> the<00:03:55.650> a<00:03:55.890> minor<00:03:56.580> the<00:03:56.820> E<00:03:56.850> minor

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
just like this the a minor the E minor

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:00.980 
just like this the a minor the E minor
are<00:03:57.540> the<00:03:57.720> exact<00:03:58.170> same<00:03:58.290> and<00:03:58.800> then<00:03:59.700> the<00:04:00.030> C<00:04:00.360> G<00:04:00.840> and

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:00.990 
are the exact same and then the C G and

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:03.470 
are the exact same and then the C G and
D<00:04:01.170> just<00:04:01.470> have<00:04:01.680> you<00:04:01.980> basically<00:04:02.459> included<00:04:02.940> this

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:03.480 
D just have you basically included this

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:12.560 
D just have you basically included this
string<00:04:04.110> so<00:04:04.410> it<00:04:04.470> goes<00:04:04.650> like<00:04:10.730> sorry<00:04:11.730> one<00:04:12.450> more

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:12.570 
string so it goes like sorry one more

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:21.220 
string so it goes like sorry one more
time

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:21.230 

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:24.430 

all<00:04:21.800> right<00:04:21.980> so<00:04:22.280> just<00:04:22.610> goes<00:04:22.820> for<00:04:23.630> the<00:04:23.750> seat<00:04:24.050> so

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:24.440 
all right so just goes for the seat so

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:29.350 
all right so just goes for the seat so
for<00:04:25.280> the<00:04:25.370> C<00:04:25.580> and<00:04:25.730> G<00:04:25.910> it<00:04:26.090> just<00:04:26.300> goes<00:04:28.120> so<00:04:29.120> straight

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:29.360 
for the C and G it just goes so straight

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:31.690 
for the C and G it just goes so straight
down<00:04:29.390> the<00:04:29.660> line<00:04:29.780> for<00:04:29.990> the<00:04:30.050> C

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:31.700 
down the line for the C

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:38.230 
down the line for the C
then<00:04:32.300> for<00:04:32.540> the<00:04:32.630> G<00:04:33.310> you're<00:04:34.310> just<00:04:34.550> doing<00:04:37.240> alright

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:38.240 
then for the G you're just doing alright

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:39.940 
then for the G you're just doing alright
so<00:04:38.480> just<00:04:38.750> reverses<00:04:39.200> the<00:04:39.320> order<00:04:39.350> these<00:04:39.710> last

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:39.950 
so just reverses the order these last

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:55.210 
so just reverses the order these last
two<00:04:40.190> strings<00:04:43.540> so<00:04:44.540> it<00:04:44.600> goes<00:04:53.770> and<00:04:54.770> then<00:04:54.920> for<00:04:55.130> the

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:55.220 
two strings so it goes and then for the

00:04:55.220 --> 00:05:09.589 
two strings so it goes and then for the
D<00:04:55.430> it's<00:04:55.490> just<00:04:56.180> like<00:04:56.420> this<00:04:58.120> right<00:04:59.180> sorry<00:05:04.960> so

00:05:09.589 --> 00:05:09.599 

00:05:09.599 --> 00:05:26.040
