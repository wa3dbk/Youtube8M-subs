the hardest ones then we can get really
strong<00:04:24.039> like<00:04:24.760> if<00:04:24.970> you<00:04:25.060> if<00:04:25.419> you<00:04:25.510> pull<00:04:25.690> off<00:04:25.780> one

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:25.930 
strong like if you if you pull off one

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:26.700 
strong like if you if you pull off one
attack<00:04:26.200> those<00:04:26.380> power

attack those power

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:28.409 
attack those power
goes<00:04:26.860> up<00:04:27.009> to<00:04:27.039> 200<00:04:27.669> and<00:04:27.819> his<00:04:27.910> health<00:04:28.090> goes<00:04:28.270> to
