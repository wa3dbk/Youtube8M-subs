Disney's<00:00:09.030> imagination<00:00:09.780> I<00:00:09.929> believe<00:00:10.440> this<00:00:10.620> as<00:00:10.800> a

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
Disney's imagination I believe this as a

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.669 
Disney's imagination I believe this as a
custom<00:00:11.219> show<00:00:11.460> to<00:00:11.790> their<00:00:12.150> park<00:00:12.540> not<00:00:13.259> to<00:00:13.530> the

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
custom show to their park not to the

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.620 
custom show to their park not to the
actual<00:00:14.099> Disney<00:00:14.490> parks<00:00:14.790> so<00:00:17.270> they<00:00:18.270> just<00:00:18.449> got

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
back from a crash in the middle of the

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.480 
back from a crash in the middle of the

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.440 
it's a good way of showing that the

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.110 
it's a good way of showing that the
server<00:02:45.739> isn't<00:02:45.980> perfect<00:02:46.489> that<00:02:46.609> it<00:02:46.730> is<00:02:46.849> run<00:02:47.090> by

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120
