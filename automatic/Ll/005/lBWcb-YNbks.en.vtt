 I went to Gilles Villeneuve I

 I already had this picket at the 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.400
 last video so I have not all the 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.910
 defenses to the max 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:35.329
 ie the last frozen earthen 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:38.579
 level 3 is never announced on the 24th 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:40.070
 the clay tower and the v8 I also 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.559
 launched on the 29th 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:44.940
 there is also the wizard tower must be 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:49.079
 want three or four games is 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:53.460
 clear she incurs 2 in the course of 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:56.430
 vodoz loading like that and also the 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.079
 tesla llvm i was going to throw their is due 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.910
 also so 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:03.370
 so it's a face 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:07.120
 embarrass them is to clarify because 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:09.220
 that your resources are protected 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:12.760
 but not that it could be 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:15.840
 always am here for for the life of 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:18.280
 every day I tried them not bad 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:21.760
 so I was not playing gameplay you 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:24.130
 propose to push village because 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:27.100
 I used then I'm doing this 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:30.400
 vision engine here and I do not think that 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:32.619
 I'll have time to decorate little ones 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:35.020
 gameplay no place in the center there will be 

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:36.340
 obviously the castle people who 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:39.399
 will sweep the whole village 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:40.660
 it's very important and also what is 

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:43.630
 Well, she has four tusks 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:46.899
 anti air on your center with the 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:48.970
 two leaders x that you can see 

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:53.050
 I have the duvet 3 million so that 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:56.860
 does 6 million ppm and that's enough 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:02:00.310
 well if we are going to say 2 4 6 8 the 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:03.039
 eight elections water tank seen that 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:05.140
 you know it's an entity that has 

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:07.690
 a lot of health points the fact of them 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:09.670
 classify there we imagine that it's going a lot 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:13.590
 we slow down the enemies if for example 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:13.590
 the enemies attack north of the village 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:19.069
 that the dragons falls on the hard 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:21.830
 isÃ©rois know was going to slow down and the 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:26.269
 two defenses aerial defense robot 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:28.099
 fast wars that's not bad and in the 

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:30.920
 corners will put the four lie 

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:32.239
 that is the ground on May 26 I do not hesitate 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:35.450
 not copaci 2007 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:37.370
 it will be soon so who are 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:40.910
 pretty well placed in the sense that if the 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:43.519
 troops if the opponent attacks with 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:47.390
 ground troops to try to ben 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:51.410
 ali well the area for too much 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:52.569
 aerial or terrestrial and valleys freeze 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:56.450
 the motivates 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:59.120
 we will make the kitchens damage in 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:03.670
 wherein changing the output tones are 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:06.170
 there to protect the mortar 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:11.079
 here it was it was a little application 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:14.180
 for the village at it first by his 

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:16.819
 antique warm so as you the 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:19.400
 know the pigs attack defense 

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:21.380
 so placing both games 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:25.540
 giant apple at this precise spot 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:26.870
 we are south of the village sava more 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:33.950
 imbalance 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:38.030
 other than I'm wrong 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:39.980
 here is pig next door and knowing that 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:41.450
 we versions and the troops likes 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:45.860
 the ease one feels 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:48.110
 you know that the peaks before the 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:51.290
 picasso leafs are the kamikazes 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:51.829
 they have their heads hard but with 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:54.140
 Giants 

00:03:51.829 --> 00:03:57.590
 good this is an opening should it 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:04:00.500
 do not try to alejo charles 27 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:06.109
 Tuesday in a version so where the cellar 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:07.819
 where there are trampolines where there are 

00:04:06.109 --> 00:04:10.790
 where the old ones ie if 

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:14.030
 they launch their giants down they will get 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:17.359
 rush to the 3 Pauline or rather 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:21.560
 to differences and that's it and it will be 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:23.510
 the same thing for pigs who 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:28.070
 mainly attack defenses 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:31.900
 so here is the rest it's more 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:36.790
 it's just to boost to the maximum 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:38.620
 the predecessor so normally it's the 

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:41.440
 preparation day during the ag says if 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:45.460
 I will be able to see what is capable 

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:47.259
 this village and that's it's true that 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:50.710
 usually I do not propose villages 

00:04:47.259 --> 00:04:54.970
 not rated steen have approved for the 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:57.910
 brand says nanny but me I the 

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:59.590
 not bad I think it'll do 

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:03.820
 frankly it's going to hurt 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:05.260
 riddles his scarf so I'm doing them 

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:07.570
 to act 7 

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:10.660
 I make them close to 8 es now 

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:14.320
 for jean and so I do not think so 

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:16.210
 for h dinner 6.5 accepted because ya 

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:18.580
 not a lot of Syrian thinkers 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:21.400
 at worst I could point it here 

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:23.479
 but you really have to subscribe 

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:27.449
 you ask it 

00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:31.199
 because otherwise it will not be interesting 

00:05:27.449 --> 00:05:33.570
 to make sykes it does not palliate to be here 

00:05:31.199 --> 00:05:36.389
 among you because at this point I think 

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:38.870
 not that among you subscribers you 

00:05:36.389 --> 00:05:42.930
 do not be hd minimum 7 

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:44.759
 so here it is possible that among 

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:45.680
 you there are some who are aged vicat 

00:05:44.759 --> 00:05:49.550
 all 

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:51.169
 me what I read here is a concern I 

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:56.380
 will be there to accompany you during 

00:05:51.169 --> 00:05:59.120
 your period and I little original comic 

00:05:56.380 --> 00:06:00.440
 so I'm happy to fly ten years 

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:01.940
 that I remember when I started 

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:06.979
 that the heater when I said to myself ah 

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:08.949
 it is a solid unit that it is expensive 

00:06:06.979 --> 00:06:12.770
 must play maybe manage and jelly 

00:06:08.949 --> 00:06:15.440
 so the little symbol to 2 wifi I go 

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:19.009
 because at last I was on my tablet 

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:20.150
 I wanted to try to record the 

00:06:19.009 --> 00:06:24.440
 sama tablets because all the time 

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:26.780
 I am and my country if it was a 

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:30.050
 little more annoying because if I 

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:32.990
 went out and where then the restless at the beach and 

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:35.440
 yes I was on the page in gt flickr 

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:37.789
 in the sand with my tablet 

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:39.349
 so for those who want to know this 

00:06:37.789 --> 00:06:42.020
 that they allow it's the sum are 

00:06:39.349 --> 00:06:43.940
 2 tab 4 

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:46.550
 it's the penultimate coast last 

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:48.830
 it's the table is what pretty yassine 

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:51.380
 el cid or bad it's like I 

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:53.720
 bought it on monday and tuesday table 

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:55.840
 hundreds it's a crime I almost 

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:59.630
 crying children 

00:06:55.840 --> 00:07:02.229
 so soon alala completes this video 

00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:08.060
 So here we are placing the last units 

00:07:02.229 --> 00:07:12.540
 which I had left that will slow down maximum 

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:17.220
 the enemy so the goal so with the 

00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:17.580
 and the huts in the Caribbean I was told 

00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:21.380
 stop 

00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:23.940
 elin the extractors and so on and so on 

00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:24.710
 so I think it's good 

00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:27.000
 built 

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:27.540
 so you're going to tell me what is that 

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:33.330
 what do you think 

00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:35.370
 in any case the levels I did 

00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:37.500
 during the video and I realized 

00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:39.360
 count of that after it's at the level of 

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:43.020
 three black balloons 

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:46.410
 finally the researcher heads it is necessary 

00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:53.430
 place wait wait until I'm here 

00:07:46.410 --> 00:07:55.290
 put them here here and here that's the 

00:07:53.430 --> 00:07:58.740
 good configuration you have to place them 

00:07:55.290 --> 00:08:00.750
 as you saw at the beginning at the level of 

00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:04.560
 the age of life you must not put him 

00:08:00.750 --> 00:08:06.210
 as I put them at the moment this is in 

00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:08.010
 anyway I hope this video will have 

00:08:06.210 --> 00:08:09.870
 more in any case do not hesitate 

00:08:08.010 --> 00:08:12.780
 read in the description to subscribe 

00:08:09.870 --> 00:08:17.000
 to the channel and commented on this it was 

00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:17.000
