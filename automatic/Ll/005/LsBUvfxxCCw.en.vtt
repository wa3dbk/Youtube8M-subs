00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 hello I 'm the sandra fenzl of pr 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.310
 inside.com Holistic Bear 100 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:06.960
 Experts 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.360
 but trainer and I want to be today 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.040
 Let's deal with a question 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.130
 these balls one of our customers 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:16.230
 has made and how or what 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:19.250
 pay attention to my horse in the spring 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.250
 right on 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:35.940
 So so many horses work properly 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:37.929
 a very important one 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.670
 health factor I have here now 

00:00:37.929 --> 00:00:42.219
 for one, a little bit 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:44.109
 we brought with us older Icelandic countries 

00:00:42.219 --> 00:00:46.269
 yes new sender a luciano at the moment 

00:00:44.109 --> 00:00:49.030
 winning is the right thing for me 

00:00:46.269 --> 00:00:51.729
 they were brute, so to speak 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:54.729
 because he just got him earlier 

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:56.500
 Spring likes nikolic and it has a lot 

00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:58.989
 It took us a long time to get it exactly 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:01.119
 have known which factors lead to 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:03.430
 This college because he very much 

00:01:01.119 --> 00:01:05.770
 Sensitive is basically there 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:07.539
 now times to note factors that 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:09.729
 if you are now at this time 

00:01:07.539 --> 00:01:11.920
 begins to instruct the horses that the 

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:13.690
 length of grass actually quite the whole 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:16.720
 most important and main factor is 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:18.549
 i will only use my horses with grass 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:20.770
 and what a length of at least 15 centimeters 

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:24.270
 tend to have even longer 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:27.340
 because the longer the glass the better 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.530
 less intense, so to speak 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:31.720
 fruit so great and stronger 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:33.759
 load the more concentrated this 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:36.880
 sugar and the strength in this very 

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:39.039
 short grass is the worse for that 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.570
 horse for metabolism was the more 

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:42.670
 Of course it will also be easier 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:44.740
 really too bellyache and colic and 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:46.299
 Can really be the horse 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:47.320
 cause harm and really too 

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:49.780
 be dangerous 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:51.399
 a second very important factor is 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:53.979
 not only the length of the grass, but 

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:56.200
 also the composition of the grass for 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:58.990
 It is so that this German horse 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:01.539
 ryegrass the times starkly what 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:03.520
 just very very rich in trajectory so 

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:05.740
 Sugar and starch is really great 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.359
 bad is wild horses because we are the 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:09.220
 question is asked again and again 

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:10.899
 of course, wild horses eat the whole thing 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:13.810
 year over grass and they have none 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:15.489
 problems or colleagues but who have 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.590
 Of course, completely different grass or 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:19.120
 another composition that have 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:21.310
 many more herbs have just 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.920
 really more minerals and 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:25.660
 structure rich hard grass and 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.579
 Accordingly, not so 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:30.400
 problem in this turbo grass we were 

00:02:27.579 --> 00:02:32.410
 Today, everywhere, you can find grass everywhere 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:35.319
 In the past, they also came visually 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:37.450
 realize that it is the grass 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:39.730
 relatively early as now if still one 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.200
 little snow is lying or just slow 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:44.049
 the fields become 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.560
 the first glass of what comes out of it what you 

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:47.530
 really 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:49.209
 its green is poison green, that's mostly 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:51.550
 just this turbo crass what the horses 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:53.440
 can metabolize very badly 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:56.370
 that specifically for a lot 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:58.810
 yield and high-performance dairy cows 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:00.970
 special was bred but 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:02.470
 meanwhile, unfortunately, almost everywhere 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:05.200
 even if it does not grow 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:07.000
 is specially sown then it is 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.739
 Of course, apart from the length of the 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.290
 grass and the composition of the 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:14.019
 Grass quite important that the horses 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:16.630
 always at work on a warmed up 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:18.790
 stomach first get it that's called grass 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:20.980
 ideally should be at least two to 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:22.690
 three hours ate hay that 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:24.850
 in the end you already more or 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:27.190
 are less and actually really 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:29.400
 the stomach is optimally prepared and 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:32.580
 then really only in minutes 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:35.080
 So I 'm the first hand 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:36.489
 grass get so the flyer song 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:38.860
 especially the just scary 

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:40.870
 I'm really sensitive 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:41.739
 first only three minutes even if the 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:43.480
 This may be ridiculous 

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:45.519
 Feel but he is easy 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:47.049
 hypersensitive and since then I have 

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:49.690
 really in three and then five minutes 

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:51.640
 yes and then seven minutes intervals 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:54.190
 and so really first citizens for the 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:55.780
 increase first minute by minute 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:57.280
 I have no problem synonymous 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:59.530
 Other horses can be the same 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:02.290
 somehow five minutes and then ten 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:02.829
 minutes and then 15 for 20 minutes 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:04.569
 to let 

00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:06.280
 but he is very very sensitive 

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:08.109
 and that's why everyone gets everything from me 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:11.319
 strictly rationed just once in a minute 

00:04:08.109 --> 00:04:13.780
 your grass feed on beautiful body 

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:15.549
 warmed stomach then it is still 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:17.950
 really important to know or to 

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:20.049
 pay attention to what you have in the past 

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:22.780
 often has cold nights 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:25.330
 so if now is a particularly cold one 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:27.220
 night was and the day it is nice 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:28.900
 then it is too here too 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:31.090
 again the trajectory and stronger 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:33.010
 composition is more concentrated because 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:35.950
 just this boy very little grass 

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:38.560
 its carbohydrates than a year ago 

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:43.510
 so to speak, it pulls it out of the ground 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:45.370
 also does not freeze and that's why it is 

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:47.320
 Also very important for cold nights 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:50.210
 horses really only at noon or so on 

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:52.610
 to let the paddock lift in short 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:54.680
 rationed portions so they just 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:57.770
 to eat that warmed grass and 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:05:00.349
 not exactly the grass what, what 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:03.860
 actually short form of freezing already 

00:05:00.349 --> 00:05:06.380
 was or is an important point too 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:08.060
 that's just what makes something else 

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:09.860
 if the horses just like that all year 

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:11.210
 a bit on the groups were because 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:13.340
 even if one now I say it more 

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:15.919
 Talk has a bit of grass growing then 

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:17.090
 there again and again and because of that 

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:19.220
 she is a little bit more 

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:21.229
 prepared as a horse what really 

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:23.090
 on a fortified winter paddocks to 

00:05:21.229 --> 00:05:24.949
 example is where none at all 

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:26.870
 grass stalk and no blade of grass and 

00:05:24.949 --> 00:05:29.150
 nothing grows so that's one too 

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:31.130
 Factor you have to consider in this 

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:32.509
 increase and also as already 

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:35.419
 I said the individual 

00:05:32.509 --> 00:05:37.759
 sensitivity of every horse so 

00:05:35.419 --> 00:05:39.740
 really, really pay attention to that 

00:05:37.759 --> 00:05:42.470
 first with only five minutes or or 

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:45.680
 then ten minutes it just increases 

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:47.270
 slowly I just got nine horses 

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:49.220
 also actually at hand and 

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:50.539
 I also recommend my clients where 

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:52.580
 the horses unfortunately 

00:05:50.539 --> 00:05:55.130
 may not know the stall owner 

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:58.220
 otherwise possible is not possible otherwise 

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:59.810
 not really now i say now 

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:01.550
 can increase once a minute 

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:03.080
 I commend my always the customer a 

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:05.509
 a little earlier on the hand already 

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:07.340
 graze because most stall owners 

00:06:05.509 --> 00:06:08.539
 The fields take on the throws 

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:11.240
 coupled and then maybe they are there 

00:06:08.539 --> 00:06:13.130
 equal to 20 30 minutes and for very 

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:15.949
 sensitive copies should my fox 

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:19.039
 that would be quite safe again 

00:06:15.949 --> 00:06:20.990
 nikolic therefore speaks norm 

00:06:19.039 --> 00:06:22.039
 stall owner or just in yours 

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:23.659
 sets up operation with the 

00:06:22.039 --> 00:06:25.310
 how could that be ? 

00:06:23.659 --> 00:06:27.590
 make optimized 

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:29.419
 in vain not even really sooner and 

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:32.030
 advance just been a horse 

00:06:29.419 --> 00:06:33.919
 Minutes on the grass left something 

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:36.110
 as long as possible he is protected 

00:06:33.919 --> 00:06:37.610
 sometimes also on house walls 

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:39.919
 or so often grows a bit 

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:41.630
 higher grass the same time that they are there 

00:06:39.919 --> 00:06:44.000
 just really on it 

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:46.250
 be prepared and the vines colic 

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.719
 and I could avoid problems I hope 

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:49.070
 I liked the video I found 

00:06:47.719 --> 00:06:49.460
 a very important topic in particular 

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:51.530
 spring 

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:53.840
 and if that's also interesting 

00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:56.389
 then feels it guides friends 

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:59.449
 Continue or just share it on youtube 

00:06:56.389 --> 00:07:01.880
 or google plus or just in 

00:06:59.449 --> 00:07:06.220
 facebook would be very happy 

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:06.220
 the horses until soon alessandra
