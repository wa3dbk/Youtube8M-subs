00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:12.940
 or 

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:12.940
 and me 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:27.380
 in the church of sando I was born in brindisi 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:30.230
 a German shepherd goes daily to the 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:33.920
 church to try to find its owner 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:36.800
 deceased this 12-year-old dog 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:39.470
 nowadays it is known practically by 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.540
 all the inhabitants of that area and is 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:44.540
 starting to spread this news by 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:46.760
 everyone this reminds the case of 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:50.239
 a dog that was also for years 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:52.070
 attending the same place where the owner 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:57.200
 I had left him 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:01:00.020
 It's funny because this dog already has a 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:03.170
 lots of time attending all kinds 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:05.570
 of baptisms communions is left to be 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:07.970
 inside the church because the people 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:10.310
 what's inside the church know that 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:13.580
 this dog has been totally alone 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:17.540
 it will be the only person who has died 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:20.030
 He could look after his owner and with 12 years of 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:22.580
 age this dog is continuously day 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:26.570
 after day returning to the same place 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:28.509
 where he was last seen by a 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:30.770
 more proof that animals feel 

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:33.020
 they have feelings like beings 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:35.479
 humans and you do not have to treat them as if 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:38.390
 were objects this incites us to 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:41.180
 reflect as I always say this guy 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:44.060
 of events also refers to the 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:45.550
 intelligence that dogs have 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:48.220
 dogs 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:50.440
 for a dog to throw years in a 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:52.960
 same place has to have also 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:56.020
 memory a memory capacity and a 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:58.630
 ability to feel that some 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:01.510
 scientists think they do not have then 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:03.580
 here are the tests of a dog that 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:05.320
 if you have them and if a but you have them 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:09.440
 they can also be developed by others 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:11.890
 dogs of the same race or of another race 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:14.900
 we are talking about a story 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:17.060
 really touching there are not some 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:19.550
 people who have even offered to 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:21.530
 adopt this dog because it does not 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:24.650
 He has the affection of a family and lives 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:27.050
 completely alone in this church 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:28.480
 there are some people interested in your 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:31.750
 adoption 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:34.599
 I hope everything goes well and 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:37.060
 I hope that the human being understands that 

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:40.140
 it is not the only species with feelings 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:40.140
 of the planet earth 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:44.650
 yes
