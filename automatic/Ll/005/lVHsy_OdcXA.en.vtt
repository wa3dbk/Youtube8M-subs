alright so I've got a couple questions

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:04.999 
alright so I've got a couple questions
from<00:00:03.030> people<00:00:03.389> on<00:00:03.570> emissive<00:00:04.259> materials<00:00:04.440> which

00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:05.009 
from people on emissive materials which

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:07.039 
from people on emissive materials which
isn't<00:00:05.250> something<00:00:05.520> I<00:00:05.790> use<00:00:06.000> too<00:00:06.270> often<00:00:06.509> but<00:00:07.020> I

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049 
isn't something I use too often but I

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:08.600 
isn't something I use too often but I
just<00:00:07.290> wanted<00:00:07.500> to<00:00:07.560> cover<00:00:07.799> how<00:00:08.099> you<00:00:08.160> would<00:00:08.460> go

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
just wanted to cover how you would go

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.299 
just wanted to cover how you would go
about<00:00:08.639> making<00:00:09.420> a<00:00:09.870> material<00:00:10.830> that<00:00:10.920> would<00:00:11.040> light

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
about making a material that would light

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.419 
about making a material that would light
up<00:00:11.340> a<00:00:11.580> scene<00:00:12.049> right<00:00:13.049> now<00:00:13.230> I'm<00:00:13.410> in<00:00:13.530> Rhino<00:00:13.980> five

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
up a scene right now I'm in Rhino five

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.210 
up a scene right now I'm in Rhino five
with<00:00:14.969> V<00:00:15.179> or<00:00:15.240> a<00:00:15.360> 1.5<00:00:15.960> but<00:00:16.379> further<00:00:16.740> in<00:00:16.920> the<00:00:17.010> video

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
with V or a 1.5 but further in the video

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:18.859 
with V or a 1.5 but further in the video
I'm<00:00:17.369> going<00:00:17.490> to<00:00:17.550> jump<00:00:17.760> over<00:00:17.880> to<00:00:18.029> Rhino<00:00:18.270> 4<00:00:18.630> with

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
I'm going to jump over to Rhino 4 with

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:20.750 
I'm going to jump over to Rhino 4 with
v-ray<00:00:19.260> one<00:00:19.500> because<00:00:20.100> I<00:00:20.130> believe<00:00:20.400> they<00:00:20.580> work

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
v-ray one because I believe they work

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.150 
v-ray one because I believe they work
differently<00:00:21.210> so<00:00:22.080> here<00:00:22.289> I<00:00:22.500> just<00:00:22.529> have<00:00:22.680> a<00:00:22.800> v-ray

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
differently so here I just have a v-ray

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.650 
differently so here I just have a v-ray
infinite<00:00:23.609> plane<00:00:23.850> and<00:00:24.180> I<00:00:24.269> got<00:00:24.420> that<00:00:24.600> from

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
infinite plane and I got that from

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.810 
infinite plane and I got that from
clicking<00:00:25.050> this<00:00:25.260> button<00:00:25.410> here<00:00:25.560> I'm<00:00:26.519> gonna<00:00:26.670> make

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
clicking this button here I'm gonna make

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.890 
clicking this button here I'm gonna make
a<00:00:26.849> box<00:00:27.859> and<00:00:28.859> we<00:00:29.010> have<00:00:29.099> our<00:00:29.220> box<00:00:29.689> next<00:00:30.689> thing<00:00:30.810> I'm

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
a box and we have our box next thing I'm

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.209 
a box and we have our box next thing I'm
going<00:00:30.990> to<00:00:31.050> do<00:00:31.170> is<00:00:31.289> just<00:00:31.470> go<00:00:31.590> in<00:00:31.679> my<00:00:31.800> camera

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
going to do is just go in my camera

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.600 
going to do is just go in my camera

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
options a view rate option sorry and I'm

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.049 
options a view rate option sorry and I'm
going<00:00:35.730> to<00:00:35.760> load<00:00:36.030> my<00:00:36.440> standard<00:00:37.440> GI<00:00:37.950> IR<00:00:38.790> map

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
going to load my standard GI IR map

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.889 
going to load my standard GI IR map
medium<00:00:40.070> with<00:00:41.070> that<00:00:41.280> in<00:00:41.520> place<00:00:41.850> we<00:00:42.329> can<00:00:42.450> jump<00:00:42.719> in

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
medium with that in place we can jump in

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.990 
medium with that in place we can jump in
and<00:00:43.110> see<00:00:43.469> the<00:00:43.770> under<00:00:44.070> environment<00:00:44.700> there's

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
and see the under environment there's

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.930 
and see the under environment there's
already<00:00:45.270> a<00:00:45.539> skylight<00:00:46.230> on<00:00:46.469> and<00:00:47.370> I'm<00:00:47.730> going<00:00:47.850> to

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
already a skylight on and I'm going to

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.610 
already a skylight on and I'm going to
turn<00:00:48.090> that<00:00:48.270> off<00:00:48.329> so<00:00:48.719> now<00:00:48.870> right<00:00:49.170> now<00:00:49.350> if<00:00:49.500> we

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
turn that off so now right now if we

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.700 
turn that off so now right now if we
render<00:00:49.920> we<00:00:50.340> should<00:00:50.520> see<00:00:50.899> nothing<00:00:51.930> it's<00:00:52.649> a

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
render we should see nothing it's a

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.400 
render we should see nothing it's a
pitch-black<00:00:52.920> scene<00:00:53.719> the<00:00:54.719> next<00:00:54.840> thing<00:00:55.110> I<00:00:55.230> need

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
pitch-black scene the next thing I need

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.619 
pitch-black scene the next thing I need
to<00:00:55.500> do<00:00:55.739> is<00:00:56.280> come<00:00:56.579> back<00:00:56.699> into<00:00:56.940> my<00:00:57.030> options<00:00:57.390> and

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
to do is come back into my options and

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.229 
to do is come back into my options and
just<00:00:57.809> make<00:00:58.140> sure<00:00:58.260> that<00:00:58.289> my<00:00:58.440> my<00:00:59.250> output<00:00:59.789> is<00:00:59.940> the

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
just make sure that my my output is the

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:01.610 
just make sure that my my output is the
same<00:01:00.449> size<00:01:00.660> in<00:01:00.809> my<00:01:00.899> window<00:01:01.140> so<00:01:01.289> I'll<00:01:01.379> get<00:01:01.500> my

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
same size in my window so I'll get my

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.369 
same size in my window so I'll get my
aspect<00:01:02.010> ratio<00:01:02.370> and<00:01:03.239> I'll<00:01:03.329> lock<00:01:03.539> it<00:01:03.570> and<00:01:04.260> I'll

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
aspect ratio and I'll lock it and I'll

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.230 
aspect ratio and I'll lock it and I'll
set<00:01:04.589> some<00:01:04.769> size<00:01:04.979> and<00:01:05.339> now<00:01:05.790> when<00:01:05.970> I<00:01:06.000> render

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
set some size and now when I render

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.969 
set some size and now when I render
you'll<00:01:06.540> see<00:01:06.750> again<00:01:07.020> it'll<00:01:07.470> still<00:01:07.680> be<00:01:07.799> black

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
you'll see again it'll still be black

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.410 
you'll see again it'll still be black
but<00:01:08.280> it<00:01:08.400> will<00:01:08.490> have<00:01:08.640> the<00:01:08.729> same<00:01:08.760> aspect<00:01:09.299> ratio

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
but it will have the same aspect ratio

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.190 
but it will have the same aspect ratio
of<00:01:09.750> the<00:01:10.290> window<00:01:10.530> on<00:01:10.650> the<00:01:10.740> screen<00:01:12.020> so<00:01:13.020> there

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
of the window on the screen so there

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.600 
of the window on the screen so there
that's<00:01:13.409> that's<00:01:13.740> all<00:01:13.860> I<00:01:13.890> really<00:01:14.070> needed<00:01:14.340> to<00:01:14.460> do

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
that's that's all I really needed to do

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.130 
that's that's all I really needed to do
there's<00:01:14.880> default<00:01:15.210> materials<00:01:15.659> on<00:01:15.840> the<00:01:15.930> plane

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
there's default materials on the plane

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.890 
there's default materials on the plane
and<00:01:16.350> on<00:01:16.439> the<00:01:16.590> box<00:01:16.740> but<00:01:17.189> now<00:01:17.430> I<00:01:17.460> want<00:01:18.000> to<00:01:18.090> add<00:01:18.450> a

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
and on the box but now I want to add a

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.100 
and on the box but now I want to add a
light<00:01:19.650> of<00:01:19.860> some<00:01:20.040> sort<00:01:20.400> so<00:01:21.150> I'm<00:01:21.630> just<00:01:21.869> going<00:01:22.020> to

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
light of some sort so I'm just going to

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.330 
light of some sort so I'm just going to
rip<00:01:22.290> spear<00:01:23.100> and<00:01:24.259> draw<00:01:25.259> sphere<00:01:25.619> and<00:01:25.860> holding

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
rip spear and draw sphere and holding

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.249 
rip spear and draw sphere and holding
ctrl<00:01:26.700> I<00:01:26.729> can<00:01:27.000> just<00:01:27.119> drag<00:01:27.330> it<00:01:27.509> up<00:01:27.630> into<00:01:27.960> the<00:01:28.229> air

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
ctrl I can just drag it up into the air

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.499 
ctrl I can just drag it up into the air
and<00:01:28.619> I<00:01:29.430> have<00:01:29.549> to<00:01:29.700> create<00:01:29.909> a<00:01:29.970> material<00:01:30.240> an

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
and I have to create a material an

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.660 
and I have to create a material an
emissive<00:01:30.780> material<00:01:31.259> so<00:01:31.710> I<00:01:31.740> open<00:01:32.100> my<00:01:32.220> material

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
emissive material so I open my material

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.190 
emissive material so I open my material
editor<00:01:33.170> right<00:01:34.170> click<00:01:34.200> create<00:01:34.890> a<00:01:35.159> new<00:01:35.490> material

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:36.200 
editor right click create a new material

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.569 
editor right click create a new material
let's<00:01:37.200> say<00:01:37.320> standard<00:01:37.740> material<00:01:38.159> that's<00:01:38.340> fine

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
let's say standard material that's fine

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:43.010 
let's say standard material that's fine
I'm<00:01:39.329> going<00:01:39.450> to<00:01:39.540> call<00:01:39.659> this<00:01:39.780> one<00:01:39.990> light<00:01:40.290> one<00:01:42.020> the

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
I'm going to call this one light one the

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.170 
I'm going to call this one light one the
color<00:01:43.439> of<00:01:43.799> this<00:01:44.250> material<00:01:44.759> doesn't<00:01:44.970> really

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
color of this material doesn't really

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.490 
color of this material doesn't really
matter<00:01:45.390> it's<00:01:45.630> going<00:01:45.780> to<00:01:45.840> be<00:01:45.899> the<00:01:46.020> emissive

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
matter it's going to be the emissive

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.410 
matter it's going to be the emissive
qualities<00:01:46.979> of<00:01:47.009> the<00:01:47.189> light<00:01:47.340> that<00:01:47.520> we<00:01:47.640> want<00:01:47.820> so<00:01:48.390> I

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
qualities of the light that we want so I

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.359 
qualities of the light that we want so I
need<00:01:48.600> to<00:01:48.689> add<00:01:48.840> that<00:01:48.869> layer<00:01:49.439> in<00:01:49.740> so<00:01:49.979> if<00:01:50.070> I<00:01:50.159> right

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
need to add that layer in so if I right

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.679 
need to add that layer in so if I right
click<00:01:50.399> my<00:01:51.119> material<00:01:51.689> and<00:01:51.930> say<00:01:52.829> create<00:01:53.189> layer

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:53.689 
click my material and say create layer

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:58.340 
click my material and say create layer
emissive<00:01:55.850> now<00:01:56.850> when<00:01:57.299> I<00:01:57.329> preview<00:01:57.750> it<00:01:57.990> you<00:01:58.229> can

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
emissive now when I preview it you can

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.830 
emissive now when I preview it you can
see<00:01:58.530> it's<00:01:58.680> it's<00:01:58.890> white<00:01:59.130> and<00:01:59.310> it's<00:01:59.520> glowing<00:01:59.840> so

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
see it's it's white and it's glowing so

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.980 
see it's it's white and it's glowing so
if<00:02:00.930> I<00:02:01.020> apply<00:02:01.170> that<00:02:01.619> to<00:02:01.920> the<00:02:02.009> sphere<00:02:02.369> here<00:02:02.990> let's

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
if I apply that to the sphere here let's

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.230 
if I apply that to the sphere here let's
change<00:02:04.140> the<00:02:04.350> color<00:02:04.530> just<00:02:04.799> for<00:02:04.950> to<00:02:05.939> show<00:02:06.090> off

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
change the color just for to show off

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.210 
change the color just for to show off
that<00:02:06.450> it<00:02:06.570> actually<00:02:07.049> glows<00:02:07.380> a<00:02:07.530> certain<00:02:07.979> color

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
that it actually glows a certain color

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.919 
that it actually glows a certain color
so<00:02:08.729> now<00:02:08.819> it'll<00:02:08.970> be<00:02:09.060> a<00:02:09.149> red<00:02:09.390> light<00:02:09.539> you<00:02:09.810> can

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
so now it'll be a red light you can

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.420 
so now it'll be a red light you can
actually<00:02:10.080> already<00:02:10.440> start<00:02:10.649> to<00:02:10.679> see<00:02:10.770> some<00:02:11.160> faint

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
actually already start to see some faint

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:12.309 
actually already start to see some faint
hints<00:02:12.030> of<00:02:12.090> the

00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:12.319 
hints of the

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:14.890 
hints of the
in<00:02:12.439> the<00:02:12.799> preview<00:02:13.310> here<00:02:13.610> so<00:02:14.480> if<00:02:14.569> I<00:02:14.629> jump<00:02:14.840> back

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
in the preview here so if I jump back

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.970 
in the preview here so if I jump back
into<00:02:15.200> my<00:02:15.290> scene<00:02:15.560> and<00:02:15.860> render<00:02:16.609> we<00:02:17.329> can<00:02:17.480> see<00:02:17.980> we

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
into my scene and render we can see we

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.940 
into my scene and render we can see we
have<00:02:19.129> a<00:02:19.159> red<00:02:19.549> glowing<00:02:20.269> orb<00:02:20.930> but<00:02:21.620> we're<00:02:21.769> not

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
have a red glowing orb but we're not

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:24.550 
have a red glowing orb but we're not
actually<00:02:22.189> casting<00:02:23.000> any<00:02:23.120> light<00:02:23.450> on<00:02:23.629> to<00:02:24.349> the

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
actually casting any light on to the

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.520 
actually casting any light on to the
scene<00:02:24.739> itself<00:02:25.099> just<00:02:25.790> fine<00:02:25.939> so<00:02:26.930> back<00:02:27.200> into<00:02:27.439> the

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
scene itself just fine so back into the

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:30.309 
scene itself just fine so back into the
materials<00:02:28.040> here<00:02:29.000> we<00:02:29.150> have<00:02:29.329> the<00:02:29.569> intensity<00:02:29.870> and

00:02:30.309 --> 00:02:30.319 
materials here we have the intensity and

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:33.640 
materials here we have the intensity and
I<00:02:31.189> increase<00:02:31.609> this<00:02:31.909> intensity<00:02:32.450> to<00:02:32.689> say<00:02:32.870> 30<00:02:33.349> and

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
I increase this intensity to say 30 and

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.280 
I increase this intensity to say 30 and
this<00:02:34.310> is<00:02:34.459> kind<00:02:34.640> of<00:02:34.670> a<00:02:34.849> you<00:02:35.720> have<00:02:35.750> to<00:02:35.989> check

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290 
this is kind of a you have to check

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:39.699 
this is kind of a you have to check
again<00:02:36.709> and<00:02:36.739> again<00:02:37.069> to<00:02:37.250> see<00:02:37.780> what<00:02:38.780> intensity<00:02:39.470> we

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:39.709 
again and again to see what intensity we

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:43.209 
again and again to see what intensity we
need<00:02:40.090> for<00:02:41.090> the<00:02:41.209> scene<00:02:41.620> really<00:02:42.620> has<00:02:42.859> to<00:02:42.980> do<00:02:43.099> with

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:43.219 
need for the scene really has to do with

00:02:43.219 --> 00:02:45.399 
need for the scene really has to do with
how<00:02:43.579> much<00:02:43.760> space<00:02:44.209> and<00:02:44.569> what<00:02:44.720> units<00:02:45.230> you're

00:02:45.399 --> 00:02:45.409 
how much space and what units you're

00:02:45.409 --> 00:02:46.929 
how much space and what units you're
working<00:02:45.680> in<00:02:45.799> for<00:02:46.010> a<00:02:46.040> very<00:02:46.189> large<00:02:46.459> team<00:02:46.790> you

00:02:46.929 --> 00:02:46.939 
working in for a very large team you

00:02:46.939 --> 00:02:48.399 
working in for a very large team you
might<00:02:47.060> need<00:02:47.209> more<00:02:47.480> intense<00:02:47.840> lights<00:02:48.139> and

00:02:48.399 --> 00:02:48.409 
might need more intense lights and

00:02:48.409 --> 00:02:50.679 
might need more intense lights and
lights<00:02:48.590> more<00:02:48.829> often<00:02:49.189> than<00:02:49.760> a<00:02:50.030> smaller<00:02:50.389> scene

00:02:50.679 --> 00:02:50.689 
lights more often than a smaller scene

00:02:50.689 --> 00:02:52.690 
lights more often than a smaller scene
like<00:02:50.870> the<00:02:50.959> one<00:02:51.109> I'm<00:02:51.200> working<00:02:51.500> in<00:02:51.620> now<00:02:51.769> so<00:02:52.549> with

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
like the one I'm working in now so with

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.800 
like the one I'm working in now so with
30<00:02:53.000> you<00:02:53.510> can<00:02:53.659> see<00:02:53.810> we<00:02:53.989> get<00:02:54.139> some<00:02:54.349> red<00:02:54.680> glow<00:02:55.810> on

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 
30 you can see we get some red glow on

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:58.659 
30 you can see we get some red glow on
one<00:02:57.139> side<00:02:57.379> of<00:02:57.650> the<00:02:57.739> box<00:02:57.889> we<00:02:58.099> can<00:02:58.159> see<00:02:58.310> the<00:02:58.549> edge

00:02:58.659 --> 00:02:58.669 
one side of the box we can see the edge

00:02:58.669 --> 00:03:00.819 
one side of the box we can see the edge
that<00:02:59.120> makes<00:02:59.329> sense<00:02:59.569> and<00:02:59.750> actually<00:03:00.319> the<00:03:00.650> red

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:00.829 
that makes sense and actually the red

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:04.000 
that makes sense and actually the red
light<00:03:01.040> is<00:03:01.220> now<00:03:01.930> white<00:03:02.930> it's<00:03:03.260> so<00:03:03.500> intense<00:03:03.829> that

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
light is now white it's so intense that

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:05.800 
light is now white it's so intense that
it's<00:03:04.280> casting<00:03:04.669> red<00:03:04.849> light<00:03:05.030> but<00:03:05.269> it<00:03:05.359> appears

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 
it's casting red light but it appears

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:09.699 
it's casting red light but it appears
white<00:03:06.290> itself<00:03:07.810> see<00:03:08.810> so<00:03:09.019> if<00:03:09.079> we<00:03:09.169> come<00:03:09.319> back<00:03:09.500> into

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:09.709 
white itself see so if we come back into

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:11.830 
white itself see so if we come back into
the<00:03:09.829> properties<00:03:10.220> here<00:03:10.459> we<00:03:11.269> can<00:03:11.419> also<00:03:11.540> change

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 
the properties here we can also change

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:13.839 
the properties here we can also change
the<00:03:12.019> transparency<00:03:12.560> now<00:03:13.310> let's<00:03:13.459> see<00:03:13.579> if<00:03:13.700> we

00:03:13.839 --> 00:03:13.849 
the transparency now let's see if we

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:16.409 
the transparency now let's see if we
make<00:03:14.030> it<00:03:14.200> then<00:03:15.200> the<00:03:15.349> diffuse<00:03:15.739> we<00:03:15.919> make<00:03:16.099> it

00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:16.419 
make it then the diffuse we make it

00:03:16.419 --> 00:03:19.990 
make it then the diffuse we make it
completely<00:03:17.419> transparent<00:03:18.729> here<00:03:19.729> in<00:03:19.879> the

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.000 
completely transparent here in the

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.399 
completely transparent here in the
emissive<00:03:20.419> qualities<00:03:20.750> if<00:03:20.900> we<00:03:21.019> made<00:03:21.199> this

00:03:21.399 --> 00:03:21.409 
emissive qualities if we made this

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:22.719 
emissive qualities if we made this
transparent<00:03:22.069> the<00:03:22.159> light<00:03:22.310> would<00:03:22.459> actually

00:03:22.719 --> 00:03:22.729 
transparent the light would actually

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:24.399 
transparent the light would actually
disappear<00:03:23.269> so<00:03:23.449> we<00:03:23.540> need<00:03:23.720> that<00:03:23.900> to<00:03:24.079> be<00:03:24.169> black

00:03:24.399 --> 00:03:24.409 
disappear so we need that to be black

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:27.460 
disappear so we need that to be black
which<00:03:24.680> means<00:03:24.889> it's<00:03:25.069> opaque<00:03:26.109> let's<00:03:27.109> see<00:03:27.290> if<00:03:27.379> we

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:27.470 
which means it's opaque let's see if we

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:28.659 
which means it's opaque let's see if we
have<00:03:27.590> any<00:03:27.709> other<00:03:27.889> options<00:03:28.280> here<00:03:28.430> we<00:03:28.549> can

00:03:28.659 --> 00:03:28.669 
have any other options here we can

00:03:28.669 --> 00:03:32.800 
have any other options here we can
change<00:03:29.799> now<00:03:30.799> that's<00:03:30.979> all<00:03:31.129> we<00:03:31.280> need<00:03:31.519> but<00:03:32.359> you

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:32.810 
change now that's all we need but you

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:35.469 
change now that's all we need but you
can<00:03:32.930> see<00:03:33.199> that<00:03:34.159> we<00:03:34.280> don't<00:03:34.609> have<00:03:34.970> too<00:03:35.299> much

00:03:35.469 --> 00:03:35.479 
can see that we don't have too much

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:37.569 
can see that we don't have too much
light<00:03:35.750> in<00:03:35.930> the<00:03:36.019> scene<00:03:36.229> now<00:03:36.440> if<00:03:36.979> we<00:03:37.099> amp<00:03:37.310> this<00:03:37.519> up

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:37.579 
light in the scene now if we amp this up

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:39.460 
light in the scene now if we amp this up
and<00:03:37.940> increase<00:03:38.269> more<00:03:38.659> and<00:03:38.690> more<00:03:39.109> and<00:03:39.319> more

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:39.470 
and increase more and more and more

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:41.530 
and increase more and more and more
intensity<00:03:40.069> it<00:03:40.639> would<00:03:40.790> start<00:03:41.000> to<00:03:41.060> illuminate

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:41.540 
intensity it would start to illuminate

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:43.449 
intensity it would start to illuminate
the<00:03:41.659> scene<00:03:41.840> but<00:03:42.739> I<00:03:42.799> don't<00:03:43.010> think<00:03:43.190> that's<00:03:43.310> the

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:43.459 
the scene but I don't think that's the

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:45.189 
the scene but I don't think that's the
right<00:03:43.579> way<00:03:43.639> to<00:03:43.819> do<00:03:44.060> it<00:03:44.090> I<00:03:44.299> think<00:03:44.479> the<00:03:44.750> best<00:03:44.959> way

00:03:45.189 --> 00:03:45.199 
right way to do it I think the best way

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:47.469 
right way to do it I think the best way
is<00:03:45.229> actually<00:03:45.709> create<00:03:46.069> multiple<00:03:46.370> copies<00:03:47.000> and

00:03:47.469 --> 00:03:47.479 
is actually create multiple copies and

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:50.890 
is actually create multiple copies and
create<00:03:47.959> multiple<00:03:48.319> lights<00:03:49.329> much<00:03:50.329> like<00:03:50.540> a<00:03:50.569> house

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:50.900 
create multiple lights much like a house

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:52.990 
create multiple lights much like a house
you<00:03:50.930> know<00:03:51.349> we<00:03:51.560> don't<00:03:51.650> have<00:03:51.799> one<00:03:52.310> single<00:03:52.819> light

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:53.000 
you know we don't have one single light

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.939 
you know we don't have one single light
that<00:03:53.269> is<00:03:53.359> incredibly<00:03:53.900> provide<00:03:54.260> that<00:03:54.590> lights

00:03:54.939 --> 00:03:54.949 
that is incredibly provide that lights

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:57.099 
that is incredibly provide that lights
the<00:03:55.069> entire<00:03:55.430> house<00:03:55.639> we<00:03:56.269> have<00:03:56.389> more<00:03:56.810> than<00:03:56.930> one

00:03:57.099 --> 00:03:57.109 
the entire house we have more than one

00:03:57.109 --> 00:03:59.770 
the entire house we have more than one
so<00:03:57.590> I'm<00:03:57.650> going<00:03:57.769> to<00:03:57.829> duplicate<00:03:58.400> my<00:03:58.430> light<00:03:58.780> and

00:03:59.770 --> 00:03:59.780 
so I'm going to duplicate my light and

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:03.069 
so I'm going to duplicate my light and
say<00:03:59.989> light<00:04:00.199> number<00:04:00.470> two<00:04:00.769> and<00:04:01.659> this<00:04:02.659> is<00:04:02.810> all<00:04:02.959> I'm

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:03.079 
say light number two and this is all I'm

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:04.839 
say light number two and this is all I'm
doing<00:04:03.409> is<00:04:03.500> just<00:04:03.799> changing<00:04:04.069> the<00:04:04.189> color<00:04:04.430> so

00:04:04.839 --> 00:04:04.849 
doing is just changing the color so

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:07.170 
doing is just changing the color so
maybe<00:04:05.090> we'll<00:04:05.269> do<00:04:05.449> like<00:04:05.479> a<00:04:05.930> lot<00:04:06.109> of<00:04:06.169> blue<00:04:06.439> color

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:07.180 
maybe we'll do like a lot of blue color

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:11.530 
maybe we'll do like a lot of blue color
so<00:04:08.180> now<00:04:08.299> when<00:04:08.419> I<00:04:08.449> come<00:04:09.229> back<00:04:09.409> in<00:04:09.709> and<00:04:10.540> render

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:11.540 
so now when I come back in and render

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:14.830 
so now when I come back in and render
here<00:04:12.459> actually<00:04:13.459> it's<00:04:13.849> still<00:04:14.180> that<00:04:14.509> I<00:04:14.540> must

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:14.840 
here actually it's still that I must

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:16.360 
here actually it's still that I must
have<00:04:14.959> misclicked<00:04:15.500> something<00:04:15.919> let's<00:04:16.130> jump

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:16.370 
have misclicked something let's jump

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:17.409 
have misclicked something let's jump
back<00:04:16.459> in<00:04:16.639> the<00:04:16.699> materials<00:04:17.090> and<00:04:17.239> see<00:04:17.329> if

00:04:17.409 --> 00:04:17.419 
back in the materials and see if

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:18.899 
back in the materials and see if
something<00:04:17.750> I<00:04:17.810> messed<00:04:18.019> up<00:04:18.139> the<00:04:18.320> light<00:04:18.470> color

00:04:18.899 --> 00:04:18.909 
something I messed up the light color

00:04:18.909 --> 00:04:23.450 
something I messed up the light color
blue

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.460 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:26.070 

maybe<00:04:24.460> I<00:04:24.550> have<00:04:24.880> to<00:04:24.910> apply<00:04:25.330> oh<00:04:25.570> yeah<00:04:25.780> that's

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:26.080 
maybe I have to apply oh yeah that's

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:27.480 
maybe I have to apply oh yeah that's
what<00:04:26.229> I<00:04:26.260> did<00:04:26.470> I<00:04:26.620> didn't<00:04:26.919> change<00:04:27.130> anything<00:04:27.280> I

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:27.490 
what I did I didn't change anything I

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:29.610 
what I did I didn't change anything I
have<00:04:27.610> to<00:04:27.699> apply<00:04:27.910> this<00:04:27.970> to<00:04:28.270> that<00:04:28.389> orb<00:04:28.690> so<00:04:29.470> now<00:04:29.590> I

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:29.620 
have to apply this to that orb so now I

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:33.000 
have to apply this to that orb so now I
have<00:04:29.800> red<00:04:30.160> red<00:04:30.699> and<00:04:30.940> blue<00:04:31.500> if<00:04:32.500> we<00:04:32.590> render<00:04:32.800> this

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:33.010 
have red red and blue if we render this

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:36.090 
have red red and blue if we render this
scene<00:04:33.070> we<00:04:33.940> have<00:04:34.060> that<00:04:34.180> blue<00:04:34.449> light<00:04:34.660> here<00:04:35.100> red

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:36.100 
scene we have that blue light here red

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:37.980 
scene we have that blue light here red
light<00:04:36.280> on<00:04:36.490> each<00:04:36.669> side

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:37.990 
light on each side

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:41.040 
light on each side
you<00:04:38.830> can<00:04:39.010> tell<00:04:39.160> it's<00:04:39.340> it's<00:04:39.520> still<00:04:39.900> kind<00:04:40.900> of<00:04:40.930> a

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:41.050 
you can tell it's it's still kind of a

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:45.629 
you can tell it's it's still kind of a
little<00:04:41.080> spotty<00:04:41.820> splotchy<00:04:42.820> and<00:04:44.400> one<00:04:45.400> thing<00:04:45.610> to

00:04:45.629 --> 00:04:45.639 
little spotty splotchy and one thing to

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:48.210 
little spotty splotchy and one thing to
consider<00:04:45.940> is<00:04:46.360> that<00:04:46.389> in<00:04:46.810> the<00:04:47.500> environment<00:04:48.130> in

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:48.220 
consider is that in the environment in

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:50.909 
consider is that in the environment in
the<00:04:48.699> world<00:04:49.000> there<00:04:49.810> is<00:04:49.960> kind<00:04:50.260> of<00:04:50.350> ambient<00:04:50.860> light

00:04:50.909 --> 00:04:50.919 
the world there is kind of ambient light

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:53.760 
the world there is kind of ambient light
so<00:04:51.370> if<00:04:51.639> we<00:04:51.729> jump<00:04:52.000> back<00:04:52.240> into<00:04:52.540> our<00:04:53.169> environment

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:53.770 
so if we jump back into our environment

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:56.610 
so if we jump back into our environment
tab<00:04:54.280> and<00:04:54.580> turn<00:04:55.180> on<00:04:55.330> a<00:04:55.570> skylight<00:04:56.050> we<00:04:56.289> can<00:04:56.470> reduce

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:56.620 
tab and turn on a skylight we can reduce

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:58.320 
tab and turn on a skylight we can reduce
it<00:04:57.010> and<00:04:57.130> say<00:04:57.250> maybe<00:04:57.430> there's<00:04:57.639> just<00:04:57.699> point<00:04:58.090> five

00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:58.330 
it and say maybe there's just point five

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:02.550 
it and say maybe there's just point five
power<00:04:58.690> and<00:04:59.400> render<00:05:00.400> that<00:05:00.930> and<00:05:01.930> now<00:05:02.169> we're

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:02.560 
power and render that and now we're

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:03.860 
power and render that and now we're
going<00:05:02.650> to<00:05:02.710> have<00:05:02.830> like<00:05:03.010> a<00:05:03.070> little<00:05:03.220> bit<00:05:03.430> of<00:05:03.460> a

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:03.870 
going to have like a little bit of a

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:08.100 
going to have like a little bit of a
generic<00:05:04.870> haze<00:05:05.580> we'll<00:05:06.580> see<00:05:06.729> what<00:05:06.880> it<00:05:07.110> finalizes

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:08.110 
generic haze we'll see what it finalizes

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:09.840 
generic haze we'll see what it finalizes
as<00:05:08.260> maybe<00:05:08.590> we<00:05:08.740> need<00:05:08.889> to<00:05:08.979> turn<00:05:09.130> that<00:05:09.340> down<00:05:09.550> even

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:09.850 
as maybe we need to turn that down even

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:11.129 
as maybe we need to turn that down even
the<00:05:09.940> last<00:05:10.060> point<00:05:10.360> five<00:05:10.510> might<00:05:10.750> be<00:05:10.900> too<00:05:11.080> strong

00:05:11.129 --> 00:05:11.139 
the last point five might be too strong

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:13.650 
the last point five might be too strong
because<00:05:12.100> we're<00:05:12.280> losing<00:05:12.729> the<00:05:12.850> saturation<00:05:13.389> of

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:13.660 
because we're losing the saturation of

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:15.450 
because we're losing the saturation of
those<00:05:13.840> lights<00:05:14.139> we're<00:05:14.680> lighting<00:05:15.190> everything

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:15.460 
those lights we're lighting everything

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:18.000 
those lights we're lighting everything
evenly<00:05:16.030> with<00:05:16.180> white<00:05:16.500> which<00:05:17.500> helps<00:05:17.800> illuminate

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:18.010 
evenly with white which helps illuminate

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:20.909 
evenly with white which helps illuminate
the<00:05:18.340> scene<00:05:18.490> but<00:05:19.139> isn't<00:05:20.139> doing<00:05:20.350> too<00:05:20.380> much<00:05:20.650> for

00:05:20.909 --> 00:05:20.919 
the scene but isn't doing too much for

00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:23.879 
the scene but isn't doing too much for
us<00:05:21.010> so<00:05:21.039> let's<00:05:21.280> jump<00:05:21.490> back<00:05:21.580> one<00:05:21.850> more<00:05:22.000> time<00:05:22.889> turn

00:05:23.879 --> 00:05:23.889 
us so let's jump back one more time turn

00:05:23.889 --> 00:05:26.460 
us so let's jump back one more time turn
on<00:05:24.010> the<00:05:24.130> background<00:05:24.520> light<00:05:24.789> and<00:05:25.389> drop<00:05:26.139> this<00:05:26.289> to

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:26.470 
on the background light and drop this to

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:31.620 
on the background light and drop this to
point<00:05:26.680> one<00:05:26.919> and<00:05:27.490> see<00:05:27.910> what<00:05:28.030> you<00:05:28.120> get<00:05:28.240> now<00:05:30.210> so<00:05:31.210> so

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:31.630 
point one and see what you get now so so

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:33.000 
point one and see what you get now so so
maybe<00:05:31.870> it's<00:05:32.080> a<00:05:32.169> little<00:05:32.289> better<00:05:32.500> this<00:05:32.680> is<00:05:32.860> also

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:33.010 
maybe it's a little better this is also

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:35.820 
maybe it's a little better this is also
with<00:05:33.220> the<00:05:33.280> background<00:05:33.460> light<00:05:33.940> on<00:05:34.090> which<00:05:34.830> deals

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:35.830 
with the background light on which deals

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:38.850 
with the background light on which deals
with<00:05:35.889> reflections<00:05:36.610> and<00:05:36.789> refractions<00:05:37.860> but

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:38.860 
with reflections and refractions but

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:41.339 
with reflections and refractions but
this<00:05:39.250> might<00:05:39.460> be<00:05:39.490> a<00:05:39.669> more<00:05:40.000> realistic<00:05:40.419> approach

00:05:41.339 --> 00:05:41.349 
this might be a more realistic approach

00:05:41.349 --> 00:05:43.560 
this might be a more realistic approach
to<00:05:41.410> lighting<00:05:42.340> the<00:05:42.430> scene<00:05:42.700> with<00:05:43.030> emissive

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:43.570 
to lighting the scene with emissive

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:46.230 
to lighting the scene with emissive
materials<00:05:43.770> so<00:05:44.770> up<00:05:44.979> next<00:05:45.010> will<00:05:45.430> be<00:05:45.460> Rhino<00:05:45.760> 4

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:46.240 
materials so up next will be Rhino 4

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:52.710 
materials so up next will be Rhino 4
with<00:05:46.570> v-ray<00:05:47.020> 1<00:05:49.320> alright<00:05:50.320> so<00:05:50.590> here<00:05:50.860> in<00:05:51.070> v-ray<00:05:51.720> 1

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:52.720 
with v-ray 1 alright so here in v-ray 1

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:54.659 
with v-ray 1 alright so here in v-ray 1
with<00:05:53.139> Rhino<00:05:53.380> 4<00:05:53.800> we're<00:05:54.070> just<00:05:54.220> going<00:05:54.340> to<00:05:54.370> look<00:05:54.520> at

00:05:54.659 --> 00:05:54.669 
with Rhino 4 we're just going to look at

00:05:54.669 --> 00:05:57.689 
with Rhino 4 we're just going to look at
a<00:05:54.960> subtle<00:05:55.960> changes<00:05:56.320> I<00:05:56.530> already<00:05:57.370> have<00:05:57.490> four

you have a little bit here and here so
