00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:30.970
 i name is amanda kenzhebaev 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:32.380
 I work in technology 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:34.899
 active internet user therefore 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:36.340
 on the page then this form I killed myself 

00:00:34.899 --> 00:00:39.730
 ads under 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:41.390
 there is an opportunity to find you for this man 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:43.489
 so 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:46.460
 taking part is all the more important when 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:49.610
 brought one of the first owners to this 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:51.800
 great car machine specially 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:54.350
 created for us a little boo for our 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:57.920
 now for our year for people of this 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:01:00.610
 site to life is not important convenience 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.610
 landing 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:10.530
 let's check now how she leads 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:10.530
 yourself on the go 

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:24.759
 until we press very confidently 

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:28.979
 its power is unclear therefore for the time being 

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:28.979
 no slow 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:52.980
 very soft move all the same no 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:52.980
 stiffness of European countries 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.759
 accelerates fins 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:59.759
 turns on successfully 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:10.899
 everything works like a net comfort uttermost 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:12.819
 very comfortable forces I said that there for 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:15.480
 very good looking at yourself as big 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:15.480
 side mirrors 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:24.740
 rearview mirror informative 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:28.750
 as far as equipment is 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:32.210
 audio control on the steering wheel 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:38.930
 more display do not have ps3 

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:41.690
 and most importantly there are usb devices running and 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:43.720
 for aux to connect external 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:50.200
 devices 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:50.200
 the conditioner here is kill zone it or 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:56.290
 all well read instruments 

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:07.610
 I would really like at least 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:09.370
 say and rolls see how he himself 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:12.030
 leads on steep 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:14.830
 rise and descent and whether to use 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:18.040
 reduced will it help it 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:20.159
 reduced speed is enough for you 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:23.290
 calmly descend 

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:27.269
 we are when lifting, too, as far as it will be 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:27.269
 convenient to climb that's it 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:43.209
 very fact that it becomes become 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:47.890
 available for us is important enough when 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:49.660
 cars going here first we 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:55.440
 what you drive 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:58.440
 which I collected a good car and 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:58.440

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:06.650
 I really liked the car 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:09.099

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:09.099
