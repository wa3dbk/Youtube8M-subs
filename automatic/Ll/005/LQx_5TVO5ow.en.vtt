00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.120 
tooth so what I've done is I've already
mixed<00:00:27.779> up<00:00:27.930> some<00:00:28.830> of<00:00:28.920> the<00:00:28.980> ingredients

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
mixed up some of the ingredients

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.160 
mixed up some of the ingredients
separately<00:00:30.029> just<00:00:30.060> to<00:00:30.359> save<00:00:30.539> on<00:00:30.720> time<00:00:30.960> my

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
separately just to save on time my

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.590 
separately just to save on time my
recipes<00:00:31.679> are<00:00:31.980> usually<00:00:32.669> fairly<00:00:32.880> quick<00:00:33.360> but

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
recipes are usually fairly quick but

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.389 
recipes are usually fairly quick but
this<00:00:33.750> one<00:00:33.930> does<00:00:34.140> take<00:00:34.410> a<00:00:34.590> little<00:00:35.040> bit<00:00:35.190> more

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
this one does take a little bit more

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.040 
this one does take a little bit more
time<00:00:35.670> with<00:00:35.700> the<00:00:35.969> amount<00:00:36.210> of<00:00:36.329> ingredients<00:00:36.570> in

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
time with the amount of ingredients in

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.020 
time with the amount of ingredients in
it<00:00:37.200> so<00:00:37.380> just<00:00:37.559> for<00:00:37.770> video<00:00:38.100> purposes<00:00:38.340> I<00:00:38.820> thought

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
it so just for video purposes I thought

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.090 
it so just for video purposes I thought
this<00:00:39.210> would<00:00:39.360> be<00:00:39.390> a<00:00:39.510> little<00:00:39.750> quicker<00:00:40.050> to<00:00:40.410> kind

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
this would be a little quicker to kind

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.850 
this would be a little quicker to kind
of<00:00:41.190> move<00:00:41.340> through<00:00:41.640> the<00:00:41.879> recipe<00:00:42.450> so<00:00:43.260> what

you<00:01:53.909> could<00:01:54.030> just<00:01:54.240> use<00:01:54.390> a<00:01:54.420> tablespoon<00:01:54.840> of<00:01:55.079> flour

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
you could just use a tablespoon of flour

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:56.840 
you could just use a tablespoon of flour
and<00:01:55.649> that<00:01:56.130> would<00:01:56.280> work<00:01:56.430> as<00:01:56.610> a<00:01:56.640> good

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
and that would work as a good

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.289 
and that would work as a good
substitution<00:01:58.610> so<00:01:59.610> lastly<00:02:00.060> you're<00:02:00.180> gonna

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
substitution so lastly you're gonna

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:03.350 
substitution so lastly you're gonna
whisk<00:02:00.689> whisk<00:02:01.590> that<00:02:01.890> all<00:02:01.950> together<00:02:02.219> and<00:02:02.880> I

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
whisk whisk that all together and I

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.790 
whisk whisk that all together and I
ended<00:02:03.930> up<00:02:04.079> adding
