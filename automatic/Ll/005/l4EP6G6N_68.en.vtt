sure correct me if I'm wrong but that's

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.100 
sure correct me if I'm wrong but that's
the<00:00:31.529> color<00:00:31.710> that<00:00:31.800> I<00:00:31.980> picked<00:00:32.219> up<00:00:32.369> here<00:00:32.669> and<00:00:33.110> for

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
the color that I picked up here and for

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.840 
the color that I picked up here and for
the<00:00:34.230> green<00:00:34.440> one<00:00:34.590> it's<00:00:34.800> a<00:00:34.860> really<00:00:35.070> pretty<00:00:35.309> kind

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
the green one it's a really pretty kind

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.910 
the green one it's a really pretty kind
of<00:00:35.940> a<00:00:36.000> mint<00:00:36.210> green<00:00:36.420> color<00:00:36.899> but<00:00:37.500> it's<00:00:37.620> a<00:00:37.710> little

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
of a mint green color but it's a little

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.700 
of a mint green color but it's a little
bit<00:00:38.070> darker<00:00:38.430> than<00:00:38.460> your<00:00:38.730> typical<00:00:38.879> mint<00:00:39.450> color

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:39.710 
bit darker than your typical mint color

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:41.930 
bit darker than your typical mint color
what<00:00:40.710> I<00:00:40.739> notice<00:00:41.129> at<00:00:41.280> first<00:00:41.520> with<00:00:41.670> these<00:00:41.790> nail

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
what I notice at first with these nail

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.729 
what I notice at first with these nail
polishes<00:00:42.480> that<00:00:42.510> they're<00:00:42.960> really<00:00:43.500> really

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
polishes that they're really really

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.220 
polishes that they're really really
creamy<00:00:44.160> and<00:00:44.489> they<00:00:45.120> paint<00:00:45.390> on<00:00:45.570> really<00:00:45.870> opaque

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
creamy and they paint on really opaque

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.069 
creamy and they paint on really opaque
and<00:00:46.559> that's<00:00:47.460> in<00:00:47.670> my<00:00:48.030> opinion<00:00:48.510> they're<00:00:48.750> kind<00:00:48.989> of

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
and that's in my opinion they're kind of

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.830 
and that's in my opinion they're kind of
already<00:00:49.649> perfect<00:00:50.190> for<00:00:50.550> one<00:00:50.700> coat<00:00:51.000> but<00:00:51.239> I'm

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
already perfect for one coat but I'm

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.119 
already perfect for one coat but I'm
gonna<00:00:52.020> go<00:00:52.079> ahead<00:00:52.289> and<00:00:52.440> put<00:00:52.559> on<00:00:52.710> the<00:00:52.829> rest<00:00:52.980> of

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
gonna go ahead and put on the rest of

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:54.200

versus on the bottle and as you can see
the<00:05:06.419> colors<00:05:06.719> are<00:05:06.840> very<00:05:07.199> similar<00:05:07.530> to<00:05:07.710> what<00:05:08.129> it

00:05:08.209 --> 00:05:08.219 
the colors are very similar to what it

00:05:08.219 --> 00:05:10.459 
the colors are very similar to what it
kind<00:05:08.400> of<00:05:08.520> portrays<00:05:09.210> from<00:05:09.479> the<00:05:09.599> bottle<00:05:09.960> but

00:05:10.459 --> 00:05:10.469 
kind of portrays from the bottle but

00:05:10.469 --> 00:05:12.110 
kind of portrays from the bottle but
it's<00:05:10.860> definitely<00:05:11.340> very<00:05:11.550> shiny

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:12.120 
it's definitely very shiny

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:13.999 
it's definitely very shiny
I<00:05:12.270> think<00:05:12.780> the<00:05:12.930> bottle<00:05:13.349> doesn't<00:05:13.440> do<00:05:13.710> the<00:05:13.889> nail

00:05:13.999 --> 00:05:14.009 
I think the bottle doesn't do the nail

00:05:14.009 --> 00:05:16.189 
I think the bottle doesn't do the nail
polish<00:05:14.340> any<00:05:14.580> justice<00:05:15.120> when<00:05:15.300> it<00:05:15.389> comes<00:05:15.569> to<00:05:15.750> how
