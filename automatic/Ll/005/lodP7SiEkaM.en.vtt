00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:10.620
 composition can be as closed as 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.269
 and open what does it mean it means that 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.000
 author of creating pictures or photos 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:17.940
 can direct viewers into consideration and 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.890
 accentuate like a specific image 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:23.519
 so she is an open space which 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.789
 placed in to one composition well here 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:28.550
 let's say 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:30.980
 before you the scheme of a closed composition 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:33.079
 why is it called closed because 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:34.700
 that both right and left we see placement 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:36.920
 vertical objects which 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:40.160
 limit enclose an object which 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:42.230
 the author wanted to show you how to close 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:46.670
 the object here is trees openly 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:50.239
 composition unlike closed she 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:52.489
 on the contrary, nothing closes any further 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:55.489
 known show openly composition scheme 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:57.979
 But imagine yourself if here to 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:01:00.140
 for example on apple from her trees would not 

00:00:57.979 --> 00:01:02.420
 was in the foreground we would see 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:04.369
 large space in which 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:07.970
 located the house we had a feeling 

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:11.659
 such a large expanse of air or 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:13.610
 something like this she is the author of this 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:16.250
 the picture put the trees that way 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:20.180
 limit our attention we see the house 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:21.799
 the house is an accent and now we 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:25.159
 we will pay first attention 

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:26.780
 why because the artist was smart of 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:30.110
 but how our attention is focused 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:34.510
 used a closed composition like us 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:39.370
 we can apply it in life 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:41.920
 we can take a girl off a man 

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:44.540
 generally remove some object and 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:47.690
 limit it again either with trees 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:50.000
 very often for example wedding 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:53.030
 photographers shoot a couple through actions 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:56.150
 leaves are blurring out of range 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.840
 sharpness and yet frame our 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:00.530
 picture 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:03.159
 a couple is a very good welcome advise 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:08.869
 use further here before us 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:11.049
 picture trinity old Testament she too 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:14.060
 built as a closed composition 

00:02:11.049 --> 00:02:15.580
 the accent here is the bowl which 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:19.190
 close the three angels 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:21.170
 you can also build a wedding 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:24.019
 photo as I said about the twigs 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:26.120
 and leaves or family photo here 

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:29.420
 imagine a big family mom dad 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:32.090
 older brother and here's a little girl. 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:34.489
 it can be used as an accent that is 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:38.240
 Both in the center of the frame, and here I am this well Cach 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:41.120
 around relatives it will be and to 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:43.940
 this and interesting and it will be clear that this 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:46.370
 girl she is here smoothly i am her all 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:49.210
 love and on this you can 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:53.740
 draw the viewer's attention 

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:57.760
 here is further here is open to you 

00:02:53.740 --> 00:03:00.250
 composition and open space here 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:02.050
 the house is no longer framed by trees and we 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:05.950
 see open space again 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:09.730
 I'm sorry to repeat it to us 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:12.790
 generally makes it clear to the viewer that 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:14.890
 around a lot of space and our 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:19.600
 imagination will draw and draw 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:23.620
 its on and on to infinity it 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:26.800
 very cool we can also take a couple 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:29.050
 in open space even on the road 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:31.690
 same and our vision will draw 

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:35.080
 space around when was watching 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:37.270
 on this photo of an opara you as if 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:38.440
 stand in that big space and 

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:42.790
 shows that the whole world 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:45.340
 them very cool on here on 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:47.590
 Shishkin's picture also has trees 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:49.870
 like a closed composition in the picture 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:53.860
 which showed earlier they posted 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:57.100
 not around the edges but tomorrow the background 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:59.580
 pictures let's say it makes us understand that 

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:04.580
 they are also in a large field 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:08.060
 they are placed randomly but none the less 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:10.040
 the balance of the picture is and he immediately see something 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:12.710
 there are no trees no 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:13.490
 bushes do not bother me to watch example 

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:16.180
 on this resource 

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:19.010
 full balance wonderful composition 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:20.109
 what did the artist want to tell us 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:23.450
 this picture 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:26.270
 Shishkin loved to draw nature and 

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:29.690
 he has a wonderful picture 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:32.230
 go take a look he wanted to show us 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:35.140
 this picture is open spaces 

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:37.860
 I wanted to show the field around this 

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:42.760
 golden where golden faces grows 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:46.330
 wanted to show the beauty of the pines he though 

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:48.580
 show room Russia and generally air 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:51.370
 picture I look at her I feel like 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:58.770
 like there is so much air so much 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:58.770
 spaces are just divine here
