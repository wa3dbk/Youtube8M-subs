00:00:07.389 --> 00:00:13.580
 and I feel proud 

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:15.170
 these players that has the ego that 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:16.760
 has a great hierarchy a great 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:18.860
 quality that 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:20.510
 They give me joys constantly but I do not 

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:23.120
 only for what the games play but 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:25.340
 by how I live in the profession 

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:27.050
 How do they help as you lie down between 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:29.539
 they 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:31.429
 as there are not six there are in videos 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:33.340
 how they work every day sometimes with 

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:35.230
 some needs 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:37.920
 I am proud to lead this 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:37.920
 team and these players 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:44.050
 It is fulfilled the first objective of reaching 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:45.970
 to the end and really very happy 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:49.210
 because it was a very difficult match 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:51.129
 really congratulate saints because it was 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:53.739
 a worthy rival was in his house at 

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:55.840
 congratulate the love of saints and we 

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:57.820
 we are happy we are in a final in 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:01.150
 a final 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:02.970
 we are going to concacaf 2015 we enter a 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:04.590
 liberators 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:06.510
 happy but down to earth 

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:08.400
 that come the most important thing that is 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.730
 play the final and why not look for the 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.470
 Title 

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:13.300
 but we continue the same with the same 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:14.290
 humility of the great group that we have the 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:16.900
 Great job that Gustavo has done 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:18.400
 matosas of the coaching staff so let's go 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:20.200
 to go and look for it, we have no other 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.430
 Our years in front of you 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:24.700
 team this is the lion that has most 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:26.469
 liked I think they have been 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.170
 three years of a roller coaster of 

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:29.909
 emotions 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.140
 but what I 've always seen that has been 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.030
 a humble team that has been delivered 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.860
 inside the field I think the tournament 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.320
 that we did not 16 points served us 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.180
 a lot to return our bases but 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.610
 today I see a much more mature game of 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.229
 the one that we were outside with tijuana and 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.759
 that leaves me calm that we left everything 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:48.299
 on the field that we play football well 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:49.289
 and we said it before we are going to come to die 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.670
 with ours 

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:52.680
 let's hope it reaches us so we 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.119
 we are happy I am sure that I read no 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.340
 right now it 's crazy but we 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:58.350
 we are quiet humble that comes what 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.450
 most important for lion do not savor 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.240
 a final against america because what else is 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.490
 you can ask not the current champion of 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.170
 Mexican soccer is also going to be the 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.929
 selection I'm sure it's going to be a 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:12.480
 great match for all the people who are going to 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:14.880
 enjoy and hopefully we win it because 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:17.819
 already being here this opportunity is not 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:20.420
 it gives you but we really respect a lot 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:22.819
 America and we are going to leave 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.500
 attack and make our game that is what 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:26.390
 our mission is going to be important 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.860
 maintains the price of the tickets and all the 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:31.640
 question no doubt that there will be a 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:34.250
 increase and I in that sense I did not want 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:36.050
 increase it to the semifinal and really 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:37.280
 there was not an increase right now we know that 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:38.870
 we have to pay prizes to the 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.459
 players we have many issues 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:42.140
 then if there is going to be an increase 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:44.209
 so I ask the fans to go to 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:49.239
 support as he always has and 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:49.239
 happy to always count on them 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:56.540
 I do not really think that 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:02.300
 the sporting rivalries but I'm 

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:04.910
 in a good team we also like this 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:06.530
 that managers do not play is played 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:09.020
 everything on the court and the lion speaks in the 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:11.120
 court and they are among the best plays at 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:12.230
 football and whoever deserves it 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:14.090
 now it is played final of the World Cup 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:15.620
 final liberators clubs this match 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:17.510
 at the end in Mexico that so special 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:19.489
 it can be for it's another end all the 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:21.660
 ends more than how you play you have to 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:23.430
 win them we never 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:24.860
 we renounce the way we play because 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:27.690
 we always have the same style but 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:29.610
 good are two tenths of 90 matches 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:30.840
 minutes that you have to be smart and 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:32.280
 you have to play with the heart because the 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:34.770
 final are played like this not because the lion has 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:36.690
 this line has been so forceful because 

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:38.730
 what we have been working on that started 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:42.180
 the semester always the idea look for the 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:44.070
 rival arch and not think about defending it not the 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:45.630
 way our defender is attacking and that 

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:48.210
 is the ideology that the coach has 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:49.410
 and we are very happy with that and he 

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:51.360
 note on the court that the team plays 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:53.280
 something that Gustavo and I ask 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:54.540
 well it's not going to change nothing 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.010
 let's play these matches the same 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:57.420
 way knowing that in front we have a 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:58.740
 rival very very complicated as is the 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:01.050
 america that is the last champ but 

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:02.520
 we also know that we have 

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:03.330
 good players and if we do the 

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:05.100
 things well we can win 

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:07.380
 quietly well it would mean something 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:09.570
 special to write you america I was lucky 

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:10.890
 score him in the game we played in 

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:13.680
 home and I wish I could score again 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:15.930
 because if we are not we are 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:17.430
 about coming out champion then the idea 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:19.140
 is that not to continue with that same 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:22.519
 mentality and if I can do a lot of goals 

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:22.519
 better because he wants to leave change
