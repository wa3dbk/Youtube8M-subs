00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
get blue buff so like cigs for example

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.700 
get blue buff so like cigs for example
if<00:01:51.210> your<00:01:51.600> mid<00:01:51.840> doesn't<00:01:52.110> have<00:01:52.229> blue<00:01:52.439> and<00:01:52.680> that

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
get crushed so you should probably give

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.580 
get crushed so you should probably give
over<00:01:56.969> to<00:01:57.090> them<00:01:57.210> and<00:01:57.409> there<00:01:58.409> are<00:01:58.469> also

they're not really that great with blue
buff<00:02:04.740> well<00:02:04.950> they<00:02:05.040> don't<00:02:05.100> need<00:02:05.399> it<00:02:05.579> it's<00:02:05.759> nice

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
buff well they don't need it it's nice

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.370 
buff well they don't need it it's nice
for<00:02:06.210> the<00:02:06.270> experience<00:02:06.840> you<00:02:06.930> get<00:02:07.079> us<00:02:07.229> for

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
for the experience you get us for

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.050 
for the experience you get us for
killing<00:02:07.530> it<00:02:07.770> and<00:02:07.860> also<00:02:08.009> the<00:02:08.190> temp<00:02:08.429> sent<00:02:08.670> CDR

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
killing it and also the temp sent CDR

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.339 
killing it and also the temp sent CDR
but<00:02:09.270> it's<00:02:09.360> not<00:02:09.479> as<00:02:09.569> good<00:02:09.629> on<00:02:09.780> them<00:02:09.989> as<00:02:10.140> it<00:02:10.259> would

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
but it's not as good on them as it would

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.949 
but it's not as good on them as it would
be<00:02:10.379> on<00:02:10.500> other<00:02:10.830> junglers<00:02:11.280> so<00:02:12.209> you<00:02:12.720> have<00:02:12.840> to

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
be on other junglers so you have to

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:13.910 
be on other junglers so you have to
weigh<00:02:13.080> with<00:02:13.260> these<00:02:13.379> things<00:02:13.530> up

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
weigh with these things up

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.770 
weigh with these things up
and<00:02:14.010> basically<00:02:14.190> like<00:02:14.520> I<00:02:14.640> said<00:02:14.940> the<00:02:15.330> beginning

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
and basically like I said the beginning

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.000 
and basically like I said the beginning
it<00:02:15.930> just<00:02:16.080> depends<00:02:16.349> what<00:02:16.440> you<00:02:16.620> think<00:02:16.800> is<00:02:16.890> going

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
it just depends what you think is going

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.910 
it just depends what you think is going
to<00:02:17.099> have<00:02:17.220> more<00:02:17.400> impact<00:02:17.910> by<00:02:18.810> taking<00:02:19.349> that<00:02:19.590> blue

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
to have more impact by taking that blue

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.710 
to have more impact by taking that blue
but<00:02:20.250> communication<00:02:20.940> is<00:02:21.150> key<00:02:21.360> right<00:02:21.540> if<00:02:21.630> you

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
but communication is key right if you

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.210 
but communication is key right if you
are<00:02:21.870> skill<00:02:22.230> milana<00:02:22.530> if<00:02:22.680> you<00:02:22.739> can<00:02:22.890> take<00:02:23.069> the

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
are skill milana if you can take the

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.820 
are skill milana if you can take the
blue<00:02:23.430> or<00:02:23.670> just<00:02:24.060> be<00:02:24.150> nice<00:02:24.360> about<00:02:24.599> it<00:02:24.780> don't<00:02:25.620> just

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
blue or just be nice about it don't just

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:29.000 
blue or just be nice about it don't just
be<00:02:25.920> entitled<00:02:26.640> to<00:02:26.880> anything<00:02:27.120> and<00:02:27.650> that<00:02:28.650> that's

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
be entitled to anything and that that's

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:30.199 
be entitled to anything and that that's
how<00:02:29.160> I<00:02:29.190> think<00:02:29.489> you<00:02:29.550> should<00:02:29.700> go<00:02:29.760> about<00:02:30.000> it

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:30.209 
how I think you should go about it

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:31.460 
how I think you should go about it
anyway<00:02:30.420> but<00:02:30.600> like<00:02:30.720> i<00:02:30.840> said<00:02:30.870> the<00:02:31.110> golden<00:02:31.350> rule

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
anyway but like i said the golden rule

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.110 
anyway but like i said the golden rule
if<00:02:31.680> it's<00:02:31.830> going<00:02:31.950> to<00:02:32.040> sign<00:02:32.220> argument<00:02:32.730> just<00:02:32.970> give

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
if it's going to sign argument just give

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.300 
if it's going to sign argument just give
the<00:02:33.239> blue<00:02:33.390> over<00:02:33.680> however<00:02:34.680> i<00:02:34.770> wanted<00:02:35.069> to<00:02:35.130> talk<00:02:35.250> a

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
the blue over however i wanted to talk a

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.160 
the blue over however i wanted to talk a
bit<00:02:35.550> deeper<00:02:35.760> about<00:02:36.300> this<00:02:36.480> topic<00:02:36.720> so<00:02:37.020> i<00:02:37.080> think

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
bit deeper about this topic so i think

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.130 
bit deeper about this topic so i think
that<00:02:37.440> this<00:02:37.709> topic<00:02:38.100> in<00:02:38.310> itself<00:02:39.030> the<00:02:39.750> question

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
that this topic in itself the question

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.199 
that this topic in itself the question
is<00:02:40.350> kind<00:02:40.650> of<00:02:40.800> wrong<00:02:41.190> like<00:02:41.489> i<00:02:41.670> don't<00:02:41.850> think<00:02:42.090> you

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209 
is kind of wrong like i don't think you

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:44.000 
is kind of wrong like i don't think you
anyone<00:02:42.600> should<00:02:42.780> be<00:02:42.900> asking<00:02:43.410> this<00:02:43.530> question<00:02:43.709> or

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
anyone should be asking this question or

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.300 
anyone should be asking this question or
thinking<00:02:44.430> about<00:02:44.730> it<00:02:44.880> this<00:02:45.060> way<00:02:45.769> mid<00:02:46.769> versus

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
thinking about it this way mid versus

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:48.920 
thinking about it this way mid versus
jungle<00:02:47.730> I<00:02:47.880> don't<00:02:48.180> think<00:02:48.269> you<00:02:48.480> should<00:02:48.510> be<00:02:48.780> doing

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
jungle I don't think you should be doing

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.320 
jungle I don't think you should be doing
that<00:02:49.230> because<00:02:49.500> when<00:02:50.340> you're<00:02:50.459> playing<00:02:50.670> solo<00:02:50.970> q

as far as MMR matchmaking goes it's

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:38.300 
as far as MMR matchmaking goes it's
meant<00:03:36.720> to<00:03:36.810> be<00:03:36.840> an<00:03:37.019> even<00:03:37.290> game<00:03:37.500> normal<00:03:38.130> games

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
meant to be an even game normal games

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:40.789 
meant to be an even game normal games
end<00:03:38.549> up<00:03:38.670> even<00:03:39.000> but<00:03:39.239> that's<00:03:39.510> on<00:03:39.750> paper<00:03:40.019> it<00:03:40.350> is<00:03:40.380> an

00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:40.799 
end up even but that's on paper it is an

end up even but that's on paper it is an
even<00:03:41.130> game<00:03:41.310> so<00:03:41.850> why<00:03:42.090> would<00:03:42.150> you<00:03:42.269> create<00:03:42.480> more

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:42.630 
even game so why would you create more

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:44.030 
even game so why would you create more
battles<00:03:42.989> in<00:03:43.109> between<00:03:43.410> your<00:03:43.560> own<00:03:43.680> team<00:03:43.920> you

don't want to be thinking about me
versus<00:03:46.079> my<00:03:46.230> team<00:03:46.500> and<00:03:46.739> that's<00:03:47.190> what<00:03:47.370> this

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459 
versus my team and that's what this

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:49.220 
versus my team and that's what this
whole<00:03:47.519> mid<00:03:47.880> versus<00:03:48.239> jungle<00:03:48.600> thing<00:03:48.780> does<00:03:48.989> if

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
whole mid versus jungle thing does if

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
like that or if your midfield is

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.330 
like that or if your midfield is
entitled<00:03:57.540> to<00:03:57.660> it<00:03:57.810> it<00:03:57.930> creates<00:03:58.590> clashes<00:03:59.190> and

your own team I kind of feel like when

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:15.559 
your own team I kind of feel like when
you're<00:04:14.100> playing<00:04:14.220> solo<00:04:14.489> q<00:04:14.760> fifty<00:04:15.180> percent<00:04:15.389> of

it is playing as well as you can the
other<00:04:17.700> fifty<00:04:18.000> percent<00:04:18.299> is<00:04:18.510> trying<00:04:19.380> to<00:04:19.470> get

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 
other fifty percent is trying to get

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:21.020 
other fifty percent is trying to get
your<00:04:19.620> teammates<00:04:19.979> to<00:04:20.070> play<00:04:20.280> as<00:04:20.430> well<00:04:20.669> as<00:04:20.880> they

your teammates to play as well as they

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:22.339 
your teammates to play as well as they
can<00:04:21.209> and<00:04:21.389> a<00:04:21.450> big<00:04:21.660> part<00:04:21.870> of<00:04:22.019> that<00:04:22.080> is<00:04:22.200> not

00:04:22.339 --> 00:04:22.349 
can and a big part of that is not

00:04:22.349 --> 00:04:24.140 
can and a big part of that is not
creating<00:04:22.890> any<00:04:23.070> arguments<00:04:23.669> within<00:04:23.849> your<00:04:24.120> own

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:24.150 
creating any arguments within your own

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:25.270 
creating any arguments within your own
team

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:25.280 
team

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:27.280 
team
and<00:04:25.370> I<00:04:26.000> kind<00:04:26.300> of<00:04:26.360> think<00:04:26.480> this<00:04:26.660> mid<00:04:26.870> versus

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:27.290 
and I kind of think this mid versus

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:29.920 
and I kind of think this mid versus
jungle<00:04:27.710> perspective<00:04:28.400> is<00:04:28.670> incorrect<00:04:29.660> from

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:29.930 
jungle perspective is incorrect from

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:31.330 
jungle perspective is incorrect from
like<00:04:30.110> I<00:04:30.230> said<00:04:30.470> you<00:04:30.620> don't<00:04:30.740> want<00:04:31.010> to<00:04:31.100> be<00:04:31.190> having

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:31.340 
like I said you don't want to be having

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:33.730
