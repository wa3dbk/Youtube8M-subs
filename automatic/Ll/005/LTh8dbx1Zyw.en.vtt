00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:14.190
 very good 

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:16.320
 I'm going to prepare a class I always say 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.130
 but that what is true I do not think it is 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:23.310
 interesting we 're not going to talk about the 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:26.070
 tonality of the 2nd major and tell you that 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:30.060
 there is a family of chords that 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:32.730
 they surround and they emerge or leave each time 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:36.840
 that we make a song in this 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:40.530
 tonality can not enter others but 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:43.920
 the most likely are these that I'm going to 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.730
 say let's say that if I do the 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.180
 all 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:50.610
 and something too 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:57.230
 the seven notes that make up that each 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:57.230
 two magazines or the speakers 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:05.550
 tell you that each note of these also 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:07.650
 they are a chord 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:11.040
 that is, each note becomes 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:14.820
 also in a chord and depending on the 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:18.410
 distance there is a chord to the 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:22.320
 In this case, the most important 

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:27.270
 there is a distance and they are called by the 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:29.520
 degree is worth for example if gago 2 is the 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.850
 second the second note of the second 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.850
 grade 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:42.390
 Total good where I 'm going to stop is 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:45.390
 what 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:48.450
 I'm not going to go into it because because if 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.850
 the class would not be very extensive but 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.970
 tell them to remember they are not always 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:57.030
 older in the family is surrounding the 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:02:02.220
 tonality again the first tone in 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:06.350
 this case is greater than 2 the second is the 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:06.350
 second is D minor 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:09.730
 the third degree 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:24.040
 the fourth is greater the fifth greater the 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:27.130
 sixth minor and the seventh if yes 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:31.180
 diminished is a rope that as well 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:35.950
 it has been said out there creates tension creates 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:38.260
 tension and it seems that I want this for 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:40.900
 to end up finishing something not and that 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:43.080
 want to go back to the beginning where after 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.080
 d 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:50.670
 true that it seems that it rests and already 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:50.670
 we had finished something unfinished good 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:55.910
 I do not want us to lose the thread, not what 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:58.610
 I want to complicate and what if I do 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:02.030
 always and in this case it's not going to be a 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:05.510
 exception is preaching by making a 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:07.280
 example make an example of why what 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:13.670
 I 'm talking about and see if it's more 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:16.400
 understandable for example if I number 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:19.290
 on a paper the whole first grade the re 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:23.969
 second 3 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:27.000
 the third miner pnv to silver number me 

00:03:23.969 --> 00:03:29.719
 I realize that if I sing the bamba with 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.719
 I play the bomb 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:39.910
 I'm using the first the fourth and the 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:43.710
 fifth grade 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:45.819
 tell you that here the chords are all 

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:49.030
 chords 

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:51.639
 simple naturals there are no alterations 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:54.849
 on this scale of 2 like the 

00:03:51.639 --> 00:03:57.489
 minor there is no if we take for example a 

00:03:54.849 --> 00:04:01.180
 piano and we play the first seven notes 

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:04.379
 because they almost always start in two 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:08.390
 pianos have five six octaves 

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:11.090
 talking about remembering up to seven can be 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:15.140
 almost always start by two if we play 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:18.950
 the first seven white keys we 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:21.950
 is giving an acid and then there are the 

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:24.020
 black keys that occupy the half that 

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:27.980
 they are smaller or black those are 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:29.810
 sustained alterations or flats or 

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:32.870
 accidental notes too that are 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:35.210
 flame does not therefore the dow is much 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:37.100
 simpler to set the example and 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:40.190
 follow it because we do not have to 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:43.220
 worry about all this then if I 

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:46.780
 I make the band by taking the first room 

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:46.780
 and fifth grade already 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:53.490
 if I take a song for example I say 

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:56.270
 because it is applicable to any style 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:05:00.120
 of music can already be pop rock flamenco 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:03.539
 or whatever it is not if I pick up a song 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:05.210
 of reed and I take the tone of what is the 

00:05:03.539 --> 00:05:07.639
 first chord 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:11.000
 the third the third degree which is a 

00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:13.340
 lower the room they are and the fifth of 

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.360
 sensor and I'll be singing that song of 

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:18.530
 Hello 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:18.530
 I have to talk 

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:25.830
 I'm tired I'm done said 

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:30.550
 OK 

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:33.020
 is an example that I want to put 

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:34.670
 surely that from now on if 

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:38.420
 analyzes there are many of the topics that you 

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:40.220
 like you know it surely then everything 

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:42.830
 what we are talking about there will be 

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:44.510
 disappointments there will be songs where between 

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:48.580
 a chord we're not talking about 

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:51.830
 I know but in 80 to 90 percent 

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:57.020
 I was always around here with this family 

00:05:51.830 --> 00:06:01.030
 of chords with yes yes I sing the sun 

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:01.030
 and pear for example and I know 

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:07.460
 and to your love 

00:06:09.129 --> 00:06:11.819
 land 

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:20.729
 for example is a is an example here 

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:26.669
 we would take the first grade 

00:06:20.729 --> 00:06:29.930
 naturalness the third that would be third 

00:06:26.669 --> 00:06:29.930
 degree that would be the third 

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:40.710
 the fourth that would be a fa greater freedom 

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:42.639
 of the tonic and in it 

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:45.030
 it would be a sun 

00:06:42.639 --> 00:06:49.970
 Gaby 

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:54.180
 again the naturalness and 

00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:55.830
 it's the sixth grade it's worth I said that 

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:59.550
 this is an example, it has not cost me 

00:06:55.830 --> 00:07:02.300
 a lot to look for three songs to put 

00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:04.699
 an example has not cost me anything 

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:09.030
 then I hope that from now on 

00:07:04.699 --> 00:07:12.570
 well, this applies to you and as 

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:17.009
 I always say open a little more and 

00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:19.289
 take the vision on what is the 

00:07:17.009 --> 00:07:22.190
 music that exciting world of 

00:07:19.289 --> 00:07:25.770
 music and in this case the guitar 

00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:28.160
 good but having known it is worth thanks and 

00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:28.160
 see you 

00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:30.790
 here
