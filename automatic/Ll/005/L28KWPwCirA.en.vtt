00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:06.420 
hi guys this is a backlash test for the

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:15.950 
hi guys this is a backlash test for the
grizzly<00:00:07.730> g<00:00:08.730> 0<00:00:09.480> 7<00:00:10.019> 0<00:00:10.110> 4<00:00:10.440> mil<00:00:11.960> the<00:00:12.960> C&amp;C<00:00:13.500> has<00:00:14.960> the

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
grizzly g 0 7 0 4 mil the C&amp;C has the

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.160 
grizzly g 0 7 0 4 mil the C&amp;C has the
Rotom<00:00:16.379> ball<00:00:16.619> screws<00:00:17.010> and<00:00:17.600> last<00:00:18.600> time<00:00:18.779> I<00:00:18.869> wasn't

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
Rotom ball screws and last time I wasn't

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:20.900 
Rotom ball screws and last time I wasn't
able<00:00:19.230> to<00:00:19.470> test<00:00:19.710> zzzz<00:00:20.220> I<00:00:20.430> didn't<00:00:20.640> have<00:00:20.730> it<00:00:20.820> all

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
able to test zzzz I didn't have it all

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.710 
able to test zzzz I didn't have it all
hooked<00:00:21.060> up<00:00:21.270> I<00:00:21.480> now<00:00:22.410> have<00:00:22.619> a<00:00:22.650> good<00:00:23.490> supply<00:00:23.760> of<00:00:23.850> a

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
hooked up I now have a good supply of a

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.150 
hooked up I now have a good supply of a
stepper<00:00:24.990> driver<00:00:25.289> so<00:00:25.560> I<00:00:25.619> can<00:00:25.800> move<00:00:25.890> all<00:00:26.010> the

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
stepper driver so I can move all the

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:32.319 
stepper driver so I can move all the
axis<00:00:27.289> so<00:00:28.289> you<00:00:29.250> have<00:00:29.400> the<00:00:29.490> indicator<00:00:29.849> set<00:00:30.090> up

00:00:32.319 --> 00:00:32.329 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:34.549 

all<00:00:33.329> right<00:00:33.450> there<00:00:33.719> I'm<00:00:33.840> just<00:00:33.989> not<00:00:34.110> seeing<00:00:34.410> it

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
all right there I'm just not seeing it

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:42.369 
all right there I'm just not seeing it
to<00:00:34.710> clear<00:00:36.680> there<00:00:37.680> we<00:00:37.890> go<00:00:40.070> and<00:00:41.070> we're<00:00:41.879> in

00:00:42.369 --> 00:00:42.379 
to clear there we go and we're in

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:46.700 
to clear there we go and we're in
basically<00:00:43.379> 0<00:00:44.629> point<00:00:45.629> one<00:00:45.840> percent<00:00:46.289> from<00:00:46.500> full

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
basically 0 point one percent from full

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:52.230 
basically 0 point one percent from full
speed

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:52.240 

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:58.230 

what<00:00:52.810> I'll<00:00:52.930> do<00:00:53.140> is<00:00:53.170> I'll<00:00:53.440> back<00:00:53.740> it<00:00:53.770> up<00:00:56.490> 20<00:00:57.490> and

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:58.240 
what I'll do is I'll back it up 20 and

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:18.050 
what I'll do is I'll back it up 20 and
then<00:00:58.420> zero<00:00:58.780> the<00:00:58.990> dro<00:01:03.000> it's<00:01:04.000> close

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.850 

now<00:01:18.600> this<00:01:18.780> in<00:01:19.049> the<00:01:19.290> direction<00:01:19.530> we're<00:01:19.829> going

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
now this in the direction we're going

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.590 
now this in the direction we're going
this<00:01:20.369> is<00:01:20.549> the<00:01:20.700> down<00:01:20.939> direction<00:01:23.479> so<00:01:24.479> we're

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
this is the down direction so we're

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.969 
this is the down direction so we're
going<00:01:24.689> to<00:01:24.780> go<00:01:24.810> ahead<00:01:24.930> and<00:01:25.020> go<00:01:25.170> to<00:01:25.200> five<00:01:27.979> and

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
going to go ahead and go to five and

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:34.719 
going to go ahead and go to five and
we'll<00:01:29.490> see<00:01:29.670> what<00:01:29.789> the<00:01:29.939> dro<00:01:30.240> says<00:01:31.520> dro<00:01:32.520> says

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:34.729 
we'll see what the dro says dro says

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:40.010 
we'll see what the dro says dro says
55.6<00:01:35.729> thousands<00:01:37.610> so<00:01:38.610> we'll<00:01:38.850> 0<00:01:39.210> and<00:01:39.720> we'll<00:01:39.869> go

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
55.6 thousands so we'll 0 and we'll go

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:52.050 
55.6 thousands so we'll 0 and we'll go
in<00:01:40.140> the<00:01:40.229> other<00:01:40.289> direction<00:01:42.890> lifting

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:52.060 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:54.300 

look<00:01:52.720> we'll<00:01:53.200> see<00:01:53.380> him<00:01:53.500> we'll<00:01:53.829> watch<00:01:54.009> it<00:01:54.220> and

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:54.310 
look we'll see him we'll watch it and

00:01:54.310 --> 00:02:05.390 
look we'll see him we'll watch it and
see<00:01:54.369> when<00:01:54.579> it<00:01:54.700> makes<00:01:55.509> its<00:01:55.659> first<00:01:55.869> bloom<00:01:56.140> it

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:05.400 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:09.560 

it<00:02:05.970> moved<00:02:07.160> they<00:02:08.160> got<00:02:08.310> one<00:02:08.550> point<00:02:08.850> eight<00:02:09.180> thou

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:09.570 
it moved they got one point eight thou

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:13.250 
it moved they got one point eight thou
on<00:02:10.110> the<00:02:10.649> dro<00:02:11.300> and<00:02:12.300> there's<00:02:12.660> movement<00:02:12.900> and

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
on the dro and there's movement and

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:27.520 
on the dro and there's movement and
we'll<00:02:13.350> go<00:02:13.470> to<00:02:13.560> five<00:02:13.830> and<00:02:14.130> see

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:33.270 

and<00:02:28.040> it's<00:02:28.520> just<00:02:28.670> about<00:02:28.880> five<00:02:30.280> dRose<00:02:31.450> 26.1<00:02:32.450> thou

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
and it's just about five dRose 26.1 thou

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.770 
and it's just about five dRose 26.1 thou
so<00:02:34.280> I've<00:02:34.730> done<00:02:34.910> this<00:02:35.030> a<00:02:35.090> couple<00:02:35.150> times<00:02:35.390> it

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
so I've done this a couple times it

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.470 
so I've done this a couple times it
looks<00:02:35.959> like<00:02:36.110> we're<00:02:36.260> getting<00:02:36.350> about<00:02:37.480> 1.3

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
looks like we're getting about 1.3

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.699 
looks like we're getting about 1.3
thousandth<00:02:39.970> backlash<00:02:40.970> was<00:02:41.510> getting<00:02:41.750> 1.6<00:02:42.500> when

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:42.709 
thousandth backlash was getting 1.6 when

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:46.270 
thousandth backlash was getting 1.6 when
the<00:02:42.800> gib<00:02:43.340> strips<00:02:43.640> were<00:02:43.819> tighter<00:02:44.830> but<00:02:45.830> I<00:02:45.860> loosen

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 
the gib strips were tighter but I loosen

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:47.410 
the gib strips were tighter but I loosen
him<00:02:46.370> up<00:02:46.459> just<00:02:46.640> a<00:02:46.760> little<00:02:46.910> bit<00:02:47.030> it<00:02:47.300> was

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
him up just a little bit it was

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:54.010 
him up just a little bit it was
basically<00:02:48.580> way<00:02:49.580> too<00:02:49.640> tight<00:02:50.239> so<00:02:52.270> and<00:02:53.270> when<00:02:53.989> I

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:54.020 
basically way too tight so and when I

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:58.110 
basically way too tight so and when I
first<00:02:54.319> started<00:02:54.470> I<00:02:54.770> had<00:02:54.950> the<00:02:56.230> Gibbs<00:02:57.230> loose<00:02:57.560> and

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
first started I had the Gibbs loose and

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.790 
first started I had the Gibbs loose and
the<00:02:59.120> head<00:02:59.300> will<00:02:59.420> drop<00:02:59.660> by<00:02:59.870> itself<00:03:00.200> on<00:03:00.440> this<00:03:00.620> one

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:00.800 
the head will drop by itself on this one

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.770 
the head will drop by itself on this one
I'm<00:03:01.550> assuming<00:03:02.000> that<00:03:02.090> happens<00:03:02.420> to<00:03:02.570> everybody

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
I'm assuming that happens to everybody

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:06.009 
I'm assuming that happens to everybody
else<00:03:03.019> too<00:03:04.090> so<00:03:05.090> but<00:03:05.450> it's<00:03:05.600> actually<00:03:05.720> working

00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:06.019 
else too so but it's actually working

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:08.290 
else too so but it's actually working
out<00:03:06.200> pretty<00:03:06.350> good<00:03:06.470> i'm<00:03:06.650> okay<00:03:06.890> with<00:03:07.300> 1.3

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:08.300 
out pretty good i'm okay with 1.3

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:11.979 
out pretty good i'm okay with 1.3
thousands<00:03:09.290> backlash<00:03:09.800> on<00:03:10.010> the<00:03:10.130> z<00:03:10.570> so<00:03:11.570> the<00:03:11.780> kits

00:03:11.979 --> 00:03:11.989 
thousands backlash on the z so the kits

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:13.090 
thousands backlash on the z so the kits
all<00:03:12.170> installed<00:03:12.470> i'm<00:03:12.680> going<00:03:12.709> to<00:03:12.860> pull<00:03:13.010> the

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:13.100 
all installed i'm going to pull the

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:14.559 
all installed i'm going to pull the
screws<00:03:13.430> and<00:03:13.670> take<00:03:13.790> some<00:03:13.940> pictures<00:03:14.150> of<00:03:14.450> them

00:03:14.559 --> 00:03:14.569 
screws and take some pictures of them

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:19.530 
screws and take some pictures of them
and<00:03:14.980> we'll<00:03:15.980> probably<00:03:16.190> put<00:03:16.370> them<00:03:16.519> up<00:03:16.610> for<00:03:16.640> sale
