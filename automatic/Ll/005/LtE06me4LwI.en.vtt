I<00:00:33.540> painted<00:00:34.020> on<00:00:34.140> little<00:00:34.410> veins<00:00:34.649> and<00:00:35.040> then<00:00:35.880> I

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
I painted on little veins and then I

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.150 
I painted on little veins and then I
glued<00:00:36.360> them<00:00:36.630> to<00:00:36.840> the<00:00:36.960> center<00:00:37.350> of<00:00:37.380> the<00:00:37.770> Wolves

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
glued them to the center of the Wolves

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.270 
glued them to the center of the Wolves
face<00:00:38.719> so<00:00:39.719> he's<00:00:40.260> looking<00:00:40.620> a<00:00:40.920> little<00:00:41.100> bit

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
face so he's looking a little bit

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.270 
face so he's looking a little bit
cross-eyed<00:00:42.200> but<00:00:43.200> there's<00:00:43.860> a<00:00:43.920> big<00:00:44.100> enough

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
cross-eyed but there's a big enough

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.650 
cross-eyed but there's a big enough
space<00:00:44.610> on<00:00:44.789> the<00:00:44.940> side<00:00:45.210> you<00:00:45.360> can<00:00:45.480> see<00:00:45.510> I'm

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
space on the side you can see I'm

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.690 
space on the side you can see I'm
fitting<00:00:45.930> my<00:00:46.020> finger<00:00:46.350> in<00:00:46.469> here<00:00:46.739> that<00:00:47.190> I<00:00:47.219> can<00:00:47.340> see

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
fitting my finger in here that I can see

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.310 
fitting my finger in here that I can see
out<00:00:47.910> of<00:00:47.940> them<00:00:48.239> if<00:00:48.300> I<00:00:48.510> want<00:00:48.690> to<00:00:48.750> look<00:00:48.930> straight

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
out of them if I want to look straight

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.660 
out of them if I want to look straight
at<00:00:49.500> someone<00:00:49.770> I<00:00:49.800> kind<00:00:50.010> of<00:00:50.039> have<00:00:50.219> to<00:00:50.250> like<00:00:50.370> look

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
at someone I kind of have to like look

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.340 
at someone I kind of have to like look
out<00:00:50.850> the<00:00:51.000> side<00:00:51.030> like<00:00:51.660> that<00:00:51.870> and<00:00:52.050> I<00:00:52.079> can<00:00:52.230> see

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
out the side like that and I can see

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.189 
out the side like that and I can see
them<00:00:52.500> pretty<00:00:52.710> well<00:00:53.420> but<00:00:54.420> that<00:00:54.600> was<00:00:54.780> pretty

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
them pretty well but that was pretty

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:56.810 
them pretty well but that was pretty
unavoidable<00:00:55.890> I<00:00:56.039> tried<00:00:56.280> mounting<00:00:56.489> them

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
unavoidable I tried mounting them

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.279 
unavoidable I tried mounting them
farther<00:00:57.030> to<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.270> side<00:00:57.600> but<00:00:57.930> I<00:00:57.960> really

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
farther to the side but I really

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.619 
farther to the side but I really
couldn't<00:00:58.469> see<00:00:58.829> out<00:00:59.070> the<00:00:59.340> middle<00:00:59.670> because<00:01:00.449> the

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
couldn't see out the middle because the

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:01.970 
couldn't see out the middle because the
dimensions<00:01:01.020> of<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.230> mask<00:01:01.440> versus<00:01:01.859> the

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
dimensions of the mask versus the

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.109 
dimensions of the mask versus the
dimensions<00:01:02.399> of<00:01:02.520> my<00:01:02.670> face<00:01:02.879> I<00:01:03.750> have<00:01:04.080> also<00:01:04.320> made<00:01:04.739> a

00:01:05.109 --> 00:01:05.119 
dimensions of my face I have also made a

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:10.340 
dimensions of my face I have also made a
little<00:01:06.119> Ascot<00:01:06.780> and<00:01:08.299> velcro<00:01:09.299> it<00:01:09.659> this<00:01:10.140> goes

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
little Ascot and velcro it this goes

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:11.870 
little Ascot and velcro it this goes
around<00:01:10.560> my<00:01:10.740> neck<00:01:10.979> and<00:01:11.010> goes<00:01:11.400> down<00:01:11.580> the<00:01:11.700> front

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
around my neck and goes down the front

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.750 
around my neck and goes down the front
of<00:01:12.000> the<00:01:12.119> shirt<00:01:12.360> that<00:01:12.630> I'm<00:01:12.720> going<00:01:12.810> to<00:01:12.869> wear

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:13.760 
of the shirt that I'm going to wear

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.070 
of the shirt that I'm going to wear
basically<00:01:14.760> covers<00:01:15.060> over<00:01:15.240> my<00:01:15.270> neck<00:01:15.420> and<00:01:15.810> head

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
basically covers over my neck and head

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.490 
basically covers over my neck and head
are<00:01:16.700> neck<00:01:17.700> and<00:01:17.729> chest<00:01:18.689> so<00:01:19.020> it<00:01:19.080> looks<00:01:19.229> like<00:01:19.290> all

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
are neck and chest so it looks like all

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.310 
are neck and chest so it looks like all
Wolfie<00:01:19.920> so<00:01:20.520> he's<00:01:21.030> pretty<00:01:21.240> much<00:01:21.330> done<00:01:21.390> things

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
Wolfie so he's pretty much done things

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:23.780 
Wolfie so he's pretty much done things
that<00:01:22.439> I<00:01:22.560> would<00:01:22.770> have<00:01:22.860> done<00:01:22.979> differently<00:01:23.189> I

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
that I would have done differently I

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.179 
that I would have done differently I
probably<00:01:24.420> would<00:01:24.689> have<00:01:24.750> used<00:01:24.960> more<00:01:25.259> clay<00:01:25.650> to

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
probably would have used more clay to

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:27.859 
probably would have used more clay to
build<00:01:26.400> a<00:01:26.490> bigger<00:01:26.700> brow<00:01:27.000> ridges<00:01:27.299> to<00:01:27.600> make<00:01:27.750> him

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
build a bigger brow ridges to make him

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:28.850 
build a bigger brow ridges to make him
look<00:01:27.960> like<00:01:28.020> he<00:01:28.259> was<00:01:28.350> kind<00:01:28.470> of<00:01:28.590> like<00:01:28.710> you<00:01:28.829> know

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
look like he was kind of like you know

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.550 
look like he was kind of like you know
squinting<00:01:29.640> down<00:01:29.880> like<00:01:30.180> you<00:01:30.299> snarling<00:01:30.780> I

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
squinting down like you snarling I

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:32.780 
squinting down like you snarling I
probably<00:01:32.040> would<00:01:32.250> have<00:01:32.310> done<00:01:32.430> the<00:01:32.490> teeth

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
probably would have done the teeth

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:33.950 
probably would have done the teeth
different<00:01:33.299> I<00:01:33.420> don't<00:01:33.570> know<00:01:33.659> if<00:01:33.720> I<00:01:33.780> would<00:01:33.869> have

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
different I don't know if I would have

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.109 
different I don't know if I would have
sculpted<00:01:34.350> them<00:01:34.500> myself<00:01:34.680> again<00:01:35.250> I<00:01:35.490> probably

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
sculpted them myself again I probably

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.510 
sculpted them myself again I probably
would<00:01:36.509> go<00:01:37.170> to<00:01:37.229> the<00:01:37.409> Van<00:01:37.560> Dyke's<00:01:37.799> catalog<00:01:38.340> to

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
would go to the Van Dyke's catalog to

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.700 
would go to the Van Dyke's catalog to
have<00:01:38.700> whole<00:01:39.150> jaw<00:01:39.420> sets<00:01:39.750> for<00:01:39.990> various<00:01:40.290> animals
