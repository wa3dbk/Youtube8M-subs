00:00:11.039 --> 00:00:14.219
 we have come or sell on eBay as before noon again 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.320
 of course from the test persons we are now in Hall 4 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:23.779
 At VDP we stood next to her is Christian Witte from Schloss Johannisberg 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:28.159
 I am very pleased to welcome Jordi everything is a lot the offer 

00:00:28.159 --> 00:00:31.240
 is true when all that was really saying so now say for you or 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:32.200
 definitely 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.040
 it was the 3 1 of about 3 1 days before 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.280
 then 1200 spectators say what is a task at Schloss Johannisberg 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.270
 ass and how about that 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:46.060
 Schloss well presented yes percent game dominated further so it is said 

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:49.460
 Johannes Berg, that's what it means for the shops 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:53.240
 Percent is also responsible for 60 5 sales 

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:57.110
 But there is Weimar ship and I have come from production 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:00.380
 my fingers are special in production and percent in the game 

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:03.860
 Ultimately, the idea generator percent for our wines and percent 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:06.450
 We would like to present percent and the OSO wines 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.430
 getting produced 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.980
 Can you tell me about it because we also have a lot of viewers 

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:12.980
 I may not know the castle yet 

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:13.869
 Landsberg 

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:15.280
 the big four hectares 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:20.070
 the local council has decided the plant Gernsheim they all the winery percent 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.010
 we have 35 meters 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:25.320
 It has been completely leased since 1720 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:30.180
 and that's why stop the oldest racing winery in the world because there is 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.840
 no other viticulture so long on this bit of board 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.560
 So how do I find the traditions and Schloss Landsberg are really real 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.250
 World Bank backups also brought my story from a rider who brought us something 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:42.380
 has a very different from there personally we are of course known 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:43.240
 and famous 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:44.690
 that we are our late harvest 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:47.170
 Randers Itzel 16 has 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:52.100
 the prince kind of torture bought the then monastery Johannisberg he has it 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:56.120
 should bite again has built a summer residence and said 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:57.970
 that the guys 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:01:59.730
 our owns sounds 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:02.260
 we said at the same time 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.010
 he wants to 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:06.900
 grow the best wine 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:11.129
 that is why Kießling has exclusively grown leases 

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:12.459
 and around 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:15.510
 then also said it should be expanded with the best wine 

00:02:17.079 --> 00:02:21.469
 Starting life on the organ every year before the harvest, a rider to Fulda 

00:02:21.469 --> 00:02:22.469
 riding 

00:02:22.469 --> 00:02:27.169
 Percent delays permit zones yield very ripe grapes and percent 

00:02:27.169 --> 00:02:29.989
 He is thus the reader to get permission to Hannes 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:32.219
 Bergmann was allowed to read along 

00:02:32.219 --> 00:02:35.129
 Seat is 75 there was a little problem 

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:37.849
 because the courier arrived too late 

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:41.040
 and percent the grapes are percent vineyard they are already matured 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.829
 advertised 

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:43.469
 Hamann drove to rot 

00:02:43.469 --> 00:02:45.749
 and had been set 

00:02:45.749 --> 00:02:49.669
 then finally came the rider on the white what exactly why election night 

00:02:49.669 --> 00:02:51.129
 came late 

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:54.349
 whether that was a problem Müller about it 

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:57.489
 Euro or 8 otherwise would be based on Vista 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:02:59.169
 known 

00:02:59.169 --> 00:03:03.179
 he had arrived late this August and the 

00:03:03.179 --> 00:03:07.039
 the administration has begun to harvest said marine spokesman said Rhein 

00:03:07.649 --> 00:03:11.290
 But what actually happened is the butler has been sitting since sixth 

00:03:11.289 --> 00:03:15.519
 Seat is credited in his cellar of such a wine has my mouth before 

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:19.149
 It was the best wine he ever drank 

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:22.790
 the first sweet wine Germany in the history of Germany is 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:23.679
 arose 

00:03:23.679 --> 00:03:28.189
 if this following far the noble rot the most potent would be yes and so had 

00:03:28.189 --> 00:03:31.829
 the first speech of dream originated and thus the late vintage we can show 

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:34.459
 write a book about it I think it's very class thanks for this too 

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:35.929
 really very detailed 

00:03:35.929 --> 00:03:39.529
 Description over the LAN we have Buchenwald years old history of 

00:03:39.529 --> 00:03:40.579
 Castle Johannisberg 

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:44.049
 The ever-steadily experts aside, God summed up your resume 

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:45.189
 how true 

00:03:45.189 --> 00:03:50.159
 and per wine 2010 for you and for Schloss Landsberg ProWein 2010 was very 

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:54.269
 Good for us to maintain that the quality of the audience was not very high 

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:57.949
 It is also bad that the right people came by 

00:03:57.949 --> 00:04:00.739
 The fair is becoming more and more international 

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:02.149
 we have 

00:04:02.149 --> 00:04:05.269
 There were huge exhibits so visitors like this year on this 

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:10.089
 Fair and percent one can say from the right today that ProWein is with the 

00:04:10.089 --> 00:04:13.519
 most important Wenzler Rob the most important fair in Europe 

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:16.129
 ours is very important for us dearer 

00:04:16.129 --> 00:04:18.539
 for the German market as well 

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:20.009
 the whole world 

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:24.180
 Euro and so the summary was very positive under one has so a bit 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:26.370
 Feeling as a victim 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:31.180
 There is no slight buoyant mood after the difficult year of 2009 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:34.629
 how a big one still went well is a great year 

00:04:34.629 --> 00:04:37.699
 but Namco for this year actually 

00:04:37.699 --> 00:04:39.430
 Carlos Aguiar 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:42.199
 I'm grateful for the timely means it was really great 

00:04:42.199 --> 00:04:43.749
 very very informative 

00:04:43.749 --> 00:04:46.090
 we all love that was just deep v 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:47.639

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:50.029
