00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:08.360
 Hi friends, how are you welcome? 

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:10.850
 more time to knit with me I am very 

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:14.090
 happy to be with you I am the 

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:17.510
 and I already missed them so much today 

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:21.039
 I bring this point of two colors that is 

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:26.240
 the combined zig zag let's start 

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:31.150
 riding multiples of 14 points +3 in 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:35.100
 this time I rode in 14 x 2 28 plus 3 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:38.100
 29 30 31 points I rode here 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:41.699
 and then let's start with the first 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:45.430
 color that mount that was the color red 

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:46.829
 we started and the first thing we have to 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:49.710
 do 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:53.629
 that there are three points at the beginning that 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.629
 we are going to do that they are not going to repeat 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.950
 in the whole round 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:02.610
 they are not going to repeat again then 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:05.330
 let's see the first point let's leave 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:05.330
 of right 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:14.910
 we passed the next point without knitting and 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:18.660
 again let's stop the one that 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:21.720
 follow and we pass the one that we do not weave on 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:24.660
 the one that we just knit and that's how 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:27.510
 we are here we start the sequence of 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:29.070
 points that are going to repeat the times that 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:32.070
 be necessary during all our 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:35.700
 back to who starts our 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:38.420
 sequence we start we weave 5 points of 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.420
 straight 

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:50.800
 245 there are my 5 points of right 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:56.020
 a loop 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:02:00.870
 a right a lazada and we return to weave 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:03.360
 5 rights 1 2 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:05.659
 3 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.300
 4 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:09.289
 Y 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:12.010
 5 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:17.290
 my 5 points of right and now 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:21.129
 we slip 2 points without knitting 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:24.549
 we weave the following one of right and the 

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:26.680
 two points that we do not knit 

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:28.629
 about the right that we just knit and 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.680
 this is how we have our sequence 

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:34.390
 of points 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:39.790
 the sequence will be of 2 4 6 8 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:42.879
 10 12 are 14 points 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:45.689
 of sequence these repeat the times that 

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:48.370
 are necessary to complete your return 

00:02:45.689 --> 00:02:51.189
 when they have 14 points left 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:53.319
 finish round 14 do not go to 

00:02:51.189 --> 00:02:57.420
 wrong they are going to weave from the 

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:57.420
 next way they will knit 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:00.310
 one 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:05.170
 two 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:08.010
 3 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:08.010
 4 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:13.140
 5 rights one loop 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:20.230
 a right a loop again five 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:22.560
 one rights 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:24.880
 two 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:26.980
 3 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:30.239
 4 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:35.080
 and 5 will be three points 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:38.340
 we weave two points together and the last one 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:40.830
 we weave networks and ready 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:44.459
 lap number 2 is a super spin 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:46.560
 simple because it's pure 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:49.680
 straight 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:53.660
 then we have rights until we finish 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:53.660
 return number 2 

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:05.450
 after having weave then four 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:08.269
 turns with our number one color 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:11.230
 let's change color to our color 

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:14.780
 number two if you realize here 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:17.959
 I made only a small knot here 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:21.919
 it's tiny, then it goes to 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:24.889
 hide carefully in the tissue and so 

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:27.860
 it's like we start with our yarn 

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:30.020
 number two and we will repeat the same 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:33.820
 what we did on lap number one is 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:33.820
 exactly the same sequence 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:50.000
 and that's it, that's how we have our 

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:53.870
 stitch are 10 laps you have to ride 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:56.840
 multiples of 14 points remember 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:59.060
 weave 4 turns of one color and six 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:00.919
 laps of 8 I hope you have them 

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:03.590
 liked the stitch of today 

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:07.150
 Thank you for your visit, take care and 

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:07.150
 See you soon goodbye
