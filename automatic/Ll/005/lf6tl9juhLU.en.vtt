00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
setup is finished the first thing that

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.810 
setup is finished the first thing that
you'll<00:00:27.750> see<00:00:28.050> is<00:00:28.260> the<00:00:28.470> new<00:00:28.680> start<00:00:29.100> menu<00:00:29.220> which

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
you'll see is the new start menu which

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.330 
you'll see is the new start menu which
is<00:00:30.000> part<00:00:30.330> of<00:00:30.510> what's<00:00:30.780> called<00:00:31.080> the<00:00:31.320> Metro<00:00:32.009> user

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
is part of what's called the Metro user

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.430 
is part of what's called the Metro user
interface<00:00:33.090> and<00:00:33.360> I<00:00:34.020> know<00:00:34.170> that<00:00:34.350> you're

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
interface and I know that you're

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.340 
interface and I know that you're
probably<00:00:34.500> thinking<00:00:35.100> what<00:00:35.610> the<00:00:35.670> crap<00:00:36.090> is<00:00:36.120> this

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:36.350 
probably thinking what the crap is this

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:38.720 
probably thinking what the crap is this
well<00:00:37.350> the<00:00:37.469> best<00:00:37.649> way<00:00:37.739> to<00:00:37.859> get<00:00:38.039> over<00:00:38.100> the<00:00:38.429> shock

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
well the best way to get over the shock

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.610 
well the best way to get over the shock
of<00:00:38.789> the<00:00:39.030> interface<00:00:39.449> is<00:00:39.510> not<00:00:39.929> to<00:00:40.109> think<00:00:40.350> of<00:00:40.499> it

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
of the interface is not to think of it

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.250 
of the interface is not to think of it
as<00:00:40.679> a<00:00:40.859> past<00:00:41.370> Windows<00:00:41.910> release<00:00:42.359> but<00:00:42.929> to<00:00:43.050> think

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
as a past Windows release but to think

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.410 
as a past Windows release but to think
of<00:00:43.440> it<00:00:43.620> more<00:00:43.890> like<00:00:43.949> an<00:00:44.339> iphone<00:00:44.940> or<00:00:45.149> android

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
of it more like an iphone or android

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.139 
of it more like an iphone or android
operating<00:00:45.989> system<00:00:46.409> so<00:00:47.309> this<00:00:47.699> would<00:00:47.969> be<00:00:48.120> your

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
operating system so this would be your

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.599 
operating system so this would be your
app<00:00:48.510> screen<00:00:48.989> and<00:00:49.199> you<00:00:49.649> can<00:00:49.769> access<00:00:50.039> all<00:00:50.579> of

00:00:50.599 --> 00:00:50.609 
app screen and you can access all of

where's<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:14.640> close<00:01:14.939> button<00:01:15.270> well<00:01:16.170> there

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
where's the close button well there

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.889 
where's the close button well there
isn't<00:01:16.710> one<00:01:17.159> when<00:01:17.729> apps<00:01:17.909> aren't<00:01:18.240> being<00:01:18.509> used

00:01:18.889 --> 00:01:18.899 
isn't one when apps aren't being used

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:21.170 
isn't one when apps aren't being used
they<00:01:19.170> aren't<00:01:19.409> closed<00:01:19.829> they're<00:01:20.310> suspended

they aren't closed they're suspended

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.330 
they aren't closed they're suspended
this<00:01:21.630> is<00:01:21.840> similar<00:01:22.079> to<00:01:22.259> how<00:01:22.530> Android<00:01:23.130> and

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
this is similar to how Android and

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.520 
this is similar to how Android and
iPhone<00:01:23.789> apps<00:01:24.030> work<00:01:24.360> so<00:01:24.659> it<00:01:24.780> creates<00:01:25.110> for<00:01:25.350> much

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
iPhone apps work so it creates for much

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.950 
iPhone apps work so it creates for much
more<00:01:25.740> fluid<00:01:26.360> application<00:01:27.360> launching<00:01:27.840> and

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
more fluid application launching and

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.679 
more fluid application launching and
better<00:01:28.170> memory<00:01:28.680> management<00:01:29.240> but<00:01:30.240> anyway<00:01:30.630> to

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
better memory management but anyway to

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.539 
better memory management but anyway to
get<00:01:30.960> back<00:01:31.200> to<00:01:31.380> the<00:01:31.469> app<00:01:31.619> screen<00:01:32.070> you<00:01:32.189> can<00:01:32.340> just

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
get back to the app screen you can just

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.760 
get back to the app screen you can just
hit<00:01:32.759> the<00:01:32.820> windows<00:01:33.390> button<00:01:33.780> and<00:01:34.109> that<00:01:34.710> will

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
hit the windows button and that will

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.039 
hit the windows button and that will
bring<00:01:35.070> you<00:01:35.280> back<00:01:35.549> this<00:01:36.090> essentially<00:01:36.719> serves

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
bring you back this essentially serves

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.349

00:01:39.349 --> 00:01:39.359 
as the home button like you would have

00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:42.469 
as the home button like you would have
on<00:01:39.539> a<00:01:39.719> smartphone<00:01:40.229> if<00:01:40.740> you<00:01:41.609> can't<00:01:41.880> get<00:01:42.060> any<00:01:42.329> of

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
on a smartphone if you can't get any of
