that he thought it was scripted he got
taken<00:04:44.150> right<00:04:44.450> off<00:04:44.660> the<00:04:44.860> mainline<00:04:45.860> track<00:04:46.250> when

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:46.460 
taken right off the mainline track when

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:48.310 
taken right off the mainline track when
when<00:04:46.700> he<00:04:46.730> said<00:04:47.060> stuff<00:04:47.270> like<00:04:47.390> this<00:04:47.690> thought<00:04:48.170> the

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:48.320 
when he said stuff like this thought the

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:50.440 
when he said stuff like this thought the
whole<00:04:48.500> thing<00:04:48.770> that<00:04:48.890> this<00:04:49.070> rehab<00:04:49.460> was<00:04:49.640> scripted

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:50.450 
whole thing that this rehab was scripted

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:51.820 
whole thing that this rehab was scripted
and<00:04:50.690> he<00:04:50.750> kind<00:04:50.930> of<00:04:51.080> dawned<00:04:51.290> on<00:04:51.530> him<00:04:51.650> I<00:04:51.800> guess

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:51.830 
and he kind of dawned on him I guess

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:55.570 
and he kind of dawned on him I guess
that<00:04:52.730> he<00:04:53.120> was<00:04:53.420> being<00:04:53.690> he<00:04:53.900> had<00:04:54.320> and<00:04:54.800> he<00:04:55.190> went<00:04:55.430> and

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:55.580 
that he was being he had and he went and

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:58.570 
that he was being he had and he went and
kind<00:04:56.180> of<00:04:56.360> cured<00:04:56.840> himself<00:04:57.100> in<00:04:58.100> some<00:04:58.430> other

00:04:58.570 --> 00:04:58.580 
kind of cured himself in some other

00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:59.890 
kind of cured himself in some other
direction<00:04:58.940> the<00:04:59.150> public<00:04:59.480> doesn't<00:04:59.780> really

00:04:59.890 --> 00:04:59.900 
direction the public doesn't really

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:02.470 
direction the public doesn't really
never<00:05:00.350> got<00:05:00.560> to<00:05:00.680> follow<00:05:00.920> any<00:05:01.160> of<00:05:01.280> that<00:05:01.550> and<00:05:01.820> so

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:02.480 
never got to follow any of that and so

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:05.170 
never got to follow any of that and so
ironically<00:05:03.220> he<00:05:04.220> ends<00:05:04.550> up<00:05:04.640> getting<00:05:04.850> he's

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:05.180 
ironically he ends up getting he's

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:07.150 
ironically he ends up getting he's
finally<00:05:05.570> got<00:05:06.140> a<00:05:06.170> job<00:05:06.260> he's<00:05:06.650> working<00:05:07.040> he's

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:07.160 
finally got a job he's working he's

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:08.980 
finally got a job he's working he's
actually<00:05:07.490> far<00:05:07.970> as<00:05:08.060> I<00:05:08.150> can<00:05:08.360> tell<00:05:08.540> it<00:05:08.690> on<00:05:08.840> the

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:08.990 
actually far as I can tell it on the

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:11.410 
actually far as I can tell it on the
straight<00:05:09.290> and<00:05:09.320> level<00:05:09.740> now<00:05:09.920> but<00:05:10.790> the<00:05:10.970> curious

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:11.420 
straight and level now but the curious

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:13.270 
straight and level now but the curious
thing<00:05:11.510> and<00:05:11.780> I<00:05:11.810> think<00:05:12.050> no<00:05:12.320> agenda<00:05:12.920> listeners
