fluke the first thing you want to look

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.810 
fluke the first thing you want to look
for<00:00:56.190> is<00:00:56.789> a<00:00:57.510> big<00:00:57.989> yellow<00:00:58.680> patch<00:00:59.070> like<00:00:59.489> this

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
for is a big yellow patch like this

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.720 
for is a big yellow patch like this
because<00:01:00.510> that<00:01:00.780> means<00:01:00.989> it<00:01:01.289> was<00:01:01.550> ripening<00:01:02.550> on

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
because that means it was ripening on

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.660 
because that means it was ripening on
the<00:01:02.820> vine<00:01:03.300> in<00:01:03.629> the<00:01:03.870> Sun<00:01:04.199> longer<00:01:05.070> so<00:01:05.549> if<00:01:05.610> it

the vine in the Sun longer so if it

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:06.770 
the vine in the Sun longer so if it
doesn't<00:01:05.880> have<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.030> patch<00:01:06.270> it<00:01:06.510> usually<00:01:06.720> means

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
doesn't have the patch it usually means

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.620 
doesn't have the patch it usually means
it<00:01:06.930> was<00:01:07.020> picked<00:01:07.260> and<00:01:07.470> then<00:01:07.619> ripened<00:01:08.010> Vader<00:01:08.630> but
