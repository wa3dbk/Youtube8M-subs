00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
you like how different these are

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.820 
you like how different these are
compared<00:01:47.459> to<00:01:47.549> rate<00:01:48.000> regular<00:01:48.869> trucks<00:01:49.200> regular

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:49.830 
compared to rate regular trucks regular

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:52.399 
compared to rate regular trucks regular
truck<00:01:50.099> sure<00:01:50.220> about<00:01:50.369> this<00:01:50.549> kind<00:01:50.789> of<00:01:50.819> shape<00:01:51.409> not

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
truck sure about this kind of shape not

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.279 
truck sure about this kind of shape not
really<00:01:52.709> the<00:01:52.829> design<00:01:53.220> though<00:01:53.429> this<00:01:53.729> has<00:01:53.970> like<00:01:54.209> a

00:01:54.279 --> 00:01:54.289 
really the design though this has like a

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:57.490 
really the design though this has like a
little<00:01:55.289> hole<00:01:55.770> in<00:01:56.039> it<00:01:56.189> which<00:01:56.490> makes<00:01:56.729> it<00:01:56.849> Hollow

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.500 
little hole in it which makes it Hollow

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:02.990 
little hole in it which makes it Hollow
but<00:01:58.500> look<00:01:58.950> at<00:01:59.189> these<00:02:01.159> and<00:02:02.159> they<00:02:02.369> look<00:02:02.549> so<00:02:02.819> much

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
but look at these and they look so much

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.940 
but look at these and they look so much
different<00:02:03.060> I<00:02:03.720> kind<00:02:04.259> of<00:02:04.380> want<00:02:04.530> to<00:02:04.590> compare<00:02:04.920> the

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
different I kind of want to compare the

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:11.300 
different I kind of want to compare the
two<00:02:07.340> also<00:02:08.340> there<00:02:08.519> longer<00:02:08.819> than<00:02:09.030> my<00:02:09.289> crooks<00:02:10.310> so

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
two also there longer than my crooks so

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:18.220 
two also there longer than my crooks so
they<00:02:11.459> fit<00:02:11.730> my<00:02:11.880> deck<00:02:12.180> better<00:02:15.920> they're<00:02:16.920> taller

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
they fit my deck better they're taller

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:22.660 
they fit my deck better they're taller
so<00:02:19.230> my<00:02:19.620> board<00:02:20.010> like<00:02:20.250> kind<00:02:20.459> of<00:02:20.549> rises<00:02:20.819> a<00:02:21.060> lot

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
so my board like kind of rises a lot

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.270 
so my board like kind of rises a lot
these<00:02:23.670> are<00:02:24.000> really<00:02:24.239> good<00:02:24.510> trucks<00:02:25.280> pretty

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
these are really good trucks pretty

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.809 
these are really good trucks pretty
pricey<00:02:26.579> but<00:02:27.060> really<00:02:27.750> good<00:02:27.930> trucks<00:02:28.260> but<00:02:28.859> the

00:02:29.809 --> 00:02:29.819 
pricey but really good trucks but the

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:34.789 
pricey but really good trucks but the
thing<00:02:30.030> about<00:02:30.060> them<00:02:30.450> is<00:02:31.400> they're<00:02:32.400> new<00:02:33.200> so<00:02:34.200> you

00:02:34.789 --> 00:02:34.799 
thing about them is they're new so you

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:36.759 
thing about them is they're new so you
gotta<00:02:34.980> wear<00:02:35.340> them<00:02:35.579> in<00:02:35.700> a<00:02:35.730> little<00:02:35.910> bit<00:02:36.120> and

00:02:36.759 --> 00:02:36.769 
gotta wear them in a little bit and

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:39.710 
gotta wear them in a little bit and
after<00:02:37.769> about<00:02:37.920> a<00:02:38.370> day<00:02:38.639> or<00:02:39.030> two<00:02:39.180> of<00:02:39.209> writing

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
after about a day or two of writing

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.220 
after about a day or two of writing
they've<00:02:40.109> actually<00:02:40.319> got<00:02:41.190> better<00:02:41.430> but<00:02:42.420> so<00:02:42.720> I<00:02:42.750> had

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
they've actually got better but so I had

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:47.840 
they've actually got better but so I had
to<00:02:43.260> loosen<00:02:43.530> them<00:02:43.829> and<00:02:45.079> still<00:02:46.579> need<00:02:47.579> some<00:02:47.819> work

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 
to loosen them and still need some work

little thieves logo right there also has
it<00:05:37.029> we<00:05:38.029> here<00:05:40.180> so<00:05:41.180> that's<00:05:41.449> pretty<00:05:41.659> much<00:05:41.750> the

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:41.900 
it we here so that's pretty much the

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:43.929 
it we here so that's pretty much the
review<00:05:42.469> they're<00:05:42.889> really<00:05:43.310> light<00:05:43.669> really

00:05:43.929 --> 00:05:43.939 
review they're really light really

00:05:43.939 --> 00:05:47.050 
review they're really light really
strong<00:05:44.659> they<00:05:45.650> have<00:05:45.860> a<00:05:45.889> good<00:05:46.219> grinding<00:05:46.729> feeling

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:47.060 
strong they have a good grinding feeling

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:49.600 
strong they have a good grinding feeling
um<00:05:47.300> so<00:05:48.050> does<00:05:48.199> crux<00:05:48.560> honestly<00:05:49.190> can't<00:05:49.430> really

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:49.610 
um so does crux honestly can't really

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:51.040 
um so does crux honestly can't really
tell<00:05:49.759> the<00:05:49.879> difference<00:05:49.909> between<00:05:50.300> the<00:05:50.629> grinding

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:51.050 
tell the difference between the grinding

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:55.390 
tell the difference between the grinding
feeling<00:05:52.990> but<00:05:53.990> these<00:05:54.259> are<00:05:54.500> way<00:05:54.860> lighter<00:05:55.159> than

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:55.400 
feeling but these are way lighter than

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:58.240 
feeling but these are way lighter than
these<00:05:55.610> Crocs<00:05:56.469> even<00:05:57.469> though<00:05:57.560> damn<00:05:58.009> these

00:05:58.240 --> 00:05:58.250 
these Crocs even though damn these

00:05:58.250 --> 00:05:59.860 
these Crocs even though damn these
crooks<00:05:58.550> are<00:05:58.699> actually<00:05:59.000> really<00:05:59.150> like<00:05:59.479> I<00:05:59.629> didn't

00:05:59.860 --> 00:05:59.870 
crooks are actually really like I didn't

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:02.499 
crooks are actually really like I didn't
realize<00:06:00.139> it<00:06:00.379> so<00:06:00.710> now<00:06:00.919> but<00:06:01.759> these<00:06:02.000> are<00:06:02.180> actually

00:06:02.499 --> 00:06:02.509 
realize it so now but these are actually

00:06:02.509 --> 00:06:05.529 
realize it so now but these are actually
lighter<00:06:02.860> it<00:06:03.860> makes<00:06:04.129> my<00:06:04.279> whole<00:06:04.490> set<00:06:04.849> up<00:06:04.969> a<00:06:05.210> lot

00:06:05.529 --> 00:06:05.539 
lighter it makes my whole set up a lot

00:06:05.539 --> 00:06:11.829 
lighter it makes my whole set up a lot
lighter<00:06:05.810> and<00:06:06.199> a<00:06:06.770> lot<00:06:06.979> more<00:06:07.009> expensive<00:06:10.839> yeah

00:06:11.829 --> 00:06:11.839 
lighter and a lot more expensive yeah

00:06:11.839 --> 00:06:13.269 
lighter and a lot more expensive yeah
pretty<00:06:12.110> much<00:06:12.199> the<00:06:12.409> only<00:06:12.439> reason<00:06:12.860> why<00:06:12.949> I<00:06:12.979> could

00:06:13.269 --> 00:06:13.279 
pretty much the only reason why I could

00:06:13.279 --> 00:06:14.529 
pretty much the only reason why I could
get<00:06:13.520> these<00:06:13.729> right<00:06:13.879> now<00:06:14.060> is<00:06:14.120> because<00:06:14.330> my

00:06:14.529 --> 00:06:14.539 
get these right now is because my

00:06:14.539 --> 00:06:16.990 
get these right now is because my
birthday<00:06:14.990> if<00:06:15.979> it<00:06:16.159> wasn't<00:06:16.460> for<00:06:16.490> that<00:06:16.759> I

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:17.000 
birthday if it wasn't for that I

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:17.950 
birthday if it wasn't for that I
probably<00:06:17.240> would<00:06:17.449> have<00:06:17.509> gotten<00:06:17.659> something

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:17.960 
probably would have gotten something

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:22.089 
probably would have gotten something
cheaper<00:06:18.500> I<00:06:19.870> would<00:06:20.870> because<00:06:21.289> I<00:06:21.319> first<00:06:21.830> I<00:06:21.979> was

00:06:22.089 --> 00:06:22.099 
cheaper I would because I first I was

00:06:22.099 --> 00:06:23.019 
cheaper I would because I first I was
