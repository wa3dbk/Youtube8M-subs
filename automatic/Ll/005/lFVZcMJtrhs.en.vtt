00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 Hi everyone, everything good, many girls me 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.390
 ask for a tutorial of 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.160
 makeup for school 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.769
 so I decided to make a super makeup 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.230
 fast it takes less than ten minutes yes 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.299
 less than ten minutes left school 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.250
 for college until the day job to 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.070
 a natural day makeup and basic 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.650
 Beautiful you know I used only products 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.720

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.990
 like it if you want to see it's just 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.970
 keep watching the video 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.710
 I'll start with benin which is a 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.690
 very cool product he has to understand 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:37.050
 solar moisturizer charges a little 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:41.910
 skin and it dispenses the base where it 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:45.329
 A little bit heavy is to go to school. 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:48.629
 Another college I think is cool is a 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:51.030
 lighter product like this one and 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.940
 define a product that is very easy to find 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:56.719
 various brands try different prices 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:59.100
 so you can choose what best 

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:01.140
 works for you 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:05.670
 so it is easy to spread as if 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:09.720
 be a moisturizer even on the face 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:11.720
 whole is ready I think I saw the 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.159
 essay for everyone is indispensable 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.150
 mainly because of the protector 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.460
 solar 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.890
 Now we go to the corrective I think 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.570
 corrective we need only those who have 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.060
 some spot a spine that is 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.430
 bothering or i week of evidence 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.619
 I do not like it, so it's not all 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:31.680
 world that needs to use the collective 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:36.000
 if you think you need to spend a 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:38.130
 here below the eyes and a 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.000
 You do not have any spirits. 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:44.130
 I'll only apply it if it spreads. 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.030
 with fingers even as they to 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.630
 best 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:53.100
 warm up the product and rotate 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:54.990
 to steal the dinho mainly below 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.310
 of eyes when set week of 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.649
 proof 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.960
 another full of work we get 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:04.680
 this face is even more tired 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:07.140
 this makeup is practical to wake up 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:16.680
 so I 'm going to spend here also a 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:20.640
 little bit in the snake to enjoy and is 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:22.110
 a very simple step but does the whole 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.989
 difference 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:27.780
 Now we go to the people and the girls. 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:30.420
 Brazilian adolescents have the 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.340
 Oily skin then to license 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:35.190
 to leave the skin more dry during 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:37.230
 the day is to let the 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:40.380
 make - up of animals and you can 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:43.560
 lead to her purse to play during 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:48.330
 So I 'm going to spend here under the 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:53.090
 eyes without overdoing ride with the 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:55.890
 so brush for light coverage 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:59.489
 To change the skin back and forth without 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:02.510
 that powder effect in the house I go 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:02.510
 spread well 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:07.769
 now the thigh I think it's a lot 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:10.470
 important to leave the skin with that 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:13.079
 health knows is not exaggerating in the blush 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:15.780
 especially in the morning so it 's a 

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:18.030
 natural light thing with face of woke up 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:20.880
 healthy and beautiful I'm going to use this one 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:23.070
 is a more persecuted color you can use 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:25.459
 any body you want that combines 

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:28.320
 more with your skin I think this 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:30.450
 chasing is works well to stay 

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:40.140
 natural, then I'll pass on our 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:41.640
 the bone and scatters back there will only give 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:44.130
 a health-oriented face or spend a 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:46.799
 here in the nose too if you 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:50.310
 You wish you could pass bronze, too. 

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:52.140
 a bronzer a blush with a more color 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:54.510
 brass 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:55.890
 It's but I recommend it to anyone who has skin 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:57.660
 more brunette or 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:00.420
 the black skin because it looks very beautiful 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:03.000
 with a health face for the whites 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:06.120
 It's kind of tanned, you know without 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.730
 then even tan all day talking 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:12.240
 This is the kind of day for school then 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:14.100
 I'll spend only the blush, if you want. 

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:15.690
 You can pass a creamy blush that is 

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:18.450
 very easy to pass you can also pass 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:20.130
 with the fingers of that beautiful goal of health 

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:21.570
 but for those who have oily skin it is not 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:24.960
 so I highly recommend why I 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:27.300
 I went with the blush with the same 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:29.040
 now the eyes will be very simple beyond 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:31.860
 to approach the camera because you're going 

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:34.380
 get b then I'll use a shadow 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:38.040
 because it is very easy to pass through the 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:41.360
 spend with the games opera waiter braga 

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:44.100
 I will apply here on the white stage the finger 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:48.210
 Soon this shadow is a little gold that 

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:50.550
 It has a beautiful shine then caring colors 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:53.280
 light golden rosette ever 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:54.600
 they work to give that 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:57.210
 cute 

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:59.310
 without much exaggeration I'll make a 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:00.960
 makeup in simple eyes because 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:02.700
 Like I said I want this 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:04.860
 Makeup is fast 

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:07.169
 I even like to use no shade. 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:09.240
 in the eyes exaggerate in the mask of lashes 

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:10.950
 You know but I'm going to use this shadow only. 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:13.080
 pretty with bright 

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:16.380
 hence I choose a eyeliner you can 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:18.930
 use a black or colored and the ultimate 

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:20.760
 difficult task is not just a matter of 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:23.130
 practice even you have to train one 

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:25.229
 bit to get the hang of it but later 

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:26.760
 You pick up too fast to do it if you 

00:05:25.229 --> 00:05:29.310
 do not want to do with liquid eyeliner 

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:31.470
 that you find tricky can do as 

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:34.200
 max same and ufma money I will do 

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:36.300
 With this equipment he shows 

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:38.250
 You guys think I'm getting a liner. 

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:41.270
 that woman's face in the middle but 

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:41.270
 truth does not know 

00:05:56.050 --> 00:06:01.460
 now I'm going to pass a lot of silas 

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:03.230
 I think it makes the whole difference 

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:06.020
 world likes big teams 

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:08.150
 so I'll take a little longer this one 

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:10.670
 Part I already have a video how to do it 

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:11.570
 your natural eyelashes can be your 

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:13.520
 substitutes 

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:16.280
 it is just a technique to apply enough 

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:19.010
 hurt and you choose your favorite 

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:20.960
 Come on, I think it makes all the difference. 

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:23.540
 if you do not want it or nothing in your eyes 

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:25.190
 Wonderful and only uses the eyelash mask 

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:27.950
 you're already with a kind of guy 

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:28.880
 super awake know with more eyes 

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:31.400
 open 

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:33.500
 now button lipstick is the most 

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:36.410
 fun you can use every day a 

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:39.050
 Different color you can use a smooth 

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:40.940
 but on the day you can use only one blog I 

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:43.730
 I'll show you a lipstick, and it's okay. 

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:46.250
 versatile than some simple it is who 

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:47.330
 but you can use it as well strong bank 

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:49.550
 even marked 

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:52.220
 You can only stain your lips with it. 

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:54.200
 A cute little thing is known that I 

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:58.600
 I'll do it now, I'll get a lipstick. 

00:06:54.200 --> 00:07:06.200
 I'll apply it like this by tapping 

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:09.080
 and spread the fear and that lipstick is great 

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:12.680
 because it has is very segmented and 

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:15.470
 Even when you put lipstick on it comes out 

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:22.180
 pink color still gets stained on the lips 

00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:24.860
 so attitude a long lasting opel vou 

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:29.840
 spread with them it is not the 

00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:31.880
 supermarket does not get heavy by day and 

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:33.110
 It's going to last a lot so I really like it. 

00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:35.510
 this technique 

00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:38.720
 so here we are this very simple 

00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:41.360
 very soft day by day from school to 

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:43.550
 quick college, I hope you guys 

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:46.150
 have enjoyed a kiss and even the 

00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:46.150
 next videos
