 present the united trophy tour with the 

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:08.710
 manchester united dennis and wing 

00:00:06.339 --> 00:00:10.570
 historic player of the red devils gave 

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:12.759
 its time to talk a little about the

 news of the club and of course a 

00:00:12.759 --> 00:00:16.240
 Player like Javier Hernández 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:18.570
 there are those who see for many years in the 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:21.250
 team due to the contribution of each campaign 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.140
 this beyond the rumors that place 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:26.160
 to chicharito out of united every time 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:26.160
 with more constancy 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.160
 good 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.510
 yes 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:13.450
 irwin analyzes that the role of chicharito 

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:15.580
 in Manchester it 's like the one that met 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:18.130
 at the time his ex-partner gunnar 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:19.630
 solskjaer so I value that what 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:23.369
 has made the Mexican since he arrived at the 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:23.369
 club has been very important 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:36.770
 for the fans 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.770
 Y 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.700
 He said 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:50.720
 32 when they go persie 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:50.720
 they do not matter 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:12.410
 for the Irish exlateral of the united e 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:14.090
 it is even surprising that there is no more 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:16.489
 Mexican players in the premier league 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:18.680
 It considers that its quality is for 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:20.480
 give much more as has happened with 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:23.920
 some Argentine players who have 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.920
 highlighted in recent years 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:27.610
 ace 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.409
 and in 6 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:50.040
 but this 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:50.040
 you think 

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:54.260
 and that came to the world 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:30.580
