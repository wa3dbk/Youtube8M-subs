00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:21.420
 personal speech of youtube beauty here is the 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.579
 Marlon ex-gay channel deserving to 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.380
 you more a video 

00:00:23.579 --> 00:00:26.759
 good guys before you start the video with 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.650
 the information I have to say to 

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:29.640
 you one more thing in these 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.529
 Sometime ago I said I was 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.420
 raining and there was noise in the background 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.190
 this time even worse has a tractor in the 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.780
 background of my house the serious people I'm going to 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.330
 tell the story very quickly here it rained 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.980
 and here the wall fell on the side of the house and 

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:42.809
 finally the real estate staff came 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.370
 repair this force of this wall and I 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.289
 I thought where are they going to do it? 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.969
 the foundation of the wall digging with a shovel 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:52.410
 something like that but the guys did it 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:55.140
 a childhood tractor and all were 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.329
 fuck if I were all 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.699
 fuck it but let's enjoy it then it's 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.769
 People today are always where I always are. 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.420
 quite discouraged even if you are 

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:05.339
 watching this video today on the 15th in the 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.229
 channel is clear as I hope most 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.179
 of you easy but finally to give a 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.220
 lively and on Monday have some 

00:01:09.179 --> 00:01:13.259
 very interesting information to get out 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.500
 future things that are going to be coming almost 

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:18.240
 that 100% sure to design online 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.280
 one of the things most people walk 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.280
 circulating around is that soon will 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.060
 be coming mansions to gta 5 way 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.740
 online 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.479
 because rockstar released this 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.190
 image you are seeing now that you have 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.440
 there with the levels that was the next car 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:33.479
 on the dirty money part and the players 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:35.310
 even before throwing dirty money part 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.259
 1 began to speculate that mansions 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.420
 could come to the game and eventually 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:41.099
 did not come but as we know the 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.759
 rockstar has already said that there will be a part 

00:01:41.099 --> 00:01:43.170
 2 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.569
 and then the players continued with the 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.349
 hope that soon will have 

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:47.970
 mansions in the game 

00:01:46.349 --> 00:01:50.190
 as you know now you can 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.140
 buy two apartments from the game or 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:54.390
 be totalizing and 20 cars that is the 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:57.690
 maximum you can have that option came 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:59.940
 there in high life abolition 1.13 there in May 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:01.679
 if I'm not mistaken, 2014 does a lot 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:03.390
 time after the image of a year that the 

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:05.610
 players may have two apartments in the 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.590
 game totaling a space of 20 cars 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.239
 if you have a high end garage that 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.560
 those that cost more than it fits 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:12.270
 ten cars in each 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.220
 since the update point 13 have this 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:15.750
 option but then the players started to 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.940
 say that with the coming of this new mansion 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:19.890
 you could then have three properties 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.560
 at the same time in addition to two apartments 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:24.209
 and could also have a mansion and some 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.730
 go even further saying that you can 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:27.280
 have two motions there scattered throughout the 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.590
 area 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.630
 wood that is the area of ​​the game where the 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:32.709
 mansions and the most interesting is that in 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:34.420
 pc version 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:36.010
 hackers of course managed to have 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:38.020
 access to some things well 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:40.360
 interesting face if on console already 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:42.190
 I had to leak a lot of console 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.390
 It's already difficult for you to have 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:44.980
 access to information 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:46.540
 now imagine the guy that's all pc 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:47.800
 organized by folders 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:50.170
 then hackers could not have 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:52.239
 access to much information and information 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.800
 that it is now that the mansions are also 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:56.170
 will obviously have as we should 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:58.780
 imagine garages and the guys got it 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:01.300
 have access to images of the interior 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:03.670
 garages human galley just take a look 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:05.890
 in these pictures here just get started 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:08.200
 in the first three images that show the 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:09.820
 franklin yes offline maybe 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.470
 because the hacker was able to access 

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:12.970
 these data using the character of the 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:14.980
 franklin and that's not to say that 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:16.690
 could come online because it does not 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:19.000
 make sense to put into mansions in the 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:20.620
 offline mode type debut would give 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.510
 experience the story mode and all 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:24.130
 So, how are you watching there? 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:25.690
 first image showing the franklin 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:27.790
 within one which appears to be a 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:29.650
 garage in a very different style than the 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:31.600
 people are currently there in the apartments 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:33.640
 Do you realize that the ceiling has been there? 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:35.860
 between adapting to sunlight and we 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:37.600
 that the ceiling is inclined or 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:39.519
 in the same format as it should have 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:41.200
 a mansion in the apartments because the 

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:43.239
 people have the roof flat because in 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:45.190
 It's true, the garage is 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:47.230
 subsoil maybe or there on the first floor 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:48.940
 then a garage on her roof there in 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:50.500
 apartments and straight while here the 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:52.390
 people see that the ceiling is different 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:53.230
 which would be a good differential 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:54.459
 interesting 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:56.799
 up there and if you have a stepdaughter 

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:58.359
 here can probably be the entrance to the 

00:03:56.799 --> 00:04:00.190
 garage door will stay in case 

00:03:58.359 --> 00:04:02.350
 in that part there again that thing 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:03.760
 glass that has a kind of thing 

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:06.400
 equal to the apartments 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:08.470
 also in the case of the end of the opposite side of the 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.489
 entrance door to the second garage 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:11.739
 image shows something very interesting 

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:13.630
 Also, how are you looking at the garage? 

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:15.280
 here is through curves will also have 

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:16.900
 giving some curvatures has a picture 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:18.310
 more importantly, it shows this better. 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:20.079
 then it would not be a gang garage 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:21.850
 the same as one of the apartments would be 

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:23.620
 a garage with the different format 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:25.419
 which is also very interesting, we see 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:27.400
 There are some lights out there, I do not know. 

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:29.289
 if that is a partition a wall 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:31.150
 Maybe it's two separate garages I 

00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:32.800
 I do not know how to confuse people 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:34.870
 See you have fire extinguishers are realizing 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:36.550
 that the graphs he also disclosed in the 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:38.530
 Clear to get access here 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:39.740
 using various hacker codes then 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:41.389
 he still could not do it yet 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:43.069
 use fine textures but to give 

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:45.259
 have an idea of ​​what the garage will look like 

00:04:43.069 --> 00:04:46.699
 the third image also shows the door 

00:04:45.259 --> 00:04:48.319
 or maybe that thing of life and how I 

00:04:46.699 --> 00:04:50.180
 said before and got on the opposite side of the 

00:04:48.319 --> 00:04:51.440
 entrance and exit from the garage to 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:53.389
 People go there too, it looks like two 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:54.680
 windows or perhaps televisions I do not know 

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:56.360
 very well that it may be that you are 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:58.250
 also notice the mini map as it has a 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:00.500
 very different format quite strange to 

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:02.300
 interior of the garage and still has 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:04.639
 two images here that show the 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:06.650
 3d modeling because it is the hacker who 

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:08.930
 got the pictures got to the 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:10.669
 3d modeling garage files by 

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:12.380
 complete as if the band is using 

00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:14.240
 some program that I do not know which is not 

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:16.220
 I understand these paranauê but the guy 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:17.990
 was able to access 3d modeling as 

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:19.970
 from the garage and in that image 

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:21.020
 you notice well how well bent 

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:23.000
 there seems to be a 

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:23.569
 curvature on the side of the van are 

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.520
 like this 

00:05:23.569 --> 00:05:27.289
 whatever this mansion is like and everything 

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:29.150
 an interesting thing to remember and that 

00:05:27.289 --> 00:05:30.560
 maybe there is no elevator for you 

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:31.789
 get in the garage a small apartment 

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:33.590
 It has an elevator, right? 

00:05:31.789 --> 00:05:35.419
 maybe here you have type access inside 

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:36.919
 but I imagine the very type enters 

00:05:35.419 --> 00:05:39.080
 in the mansion and you do not have to 

00:05:36.919 --> 00:05:41.360
 lodge between mansion in case apart 

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:43.009
 where is the house all over and the garage 

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:44.840
 maybe the thrill garage will be the same 

00:05:43.009 --> 00:05:46.699
 Imagine what a fuck you do not need. 

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:47.930
 between one and the other would be very 

00:05:46.699 --> 00:05:49.909
 Interestingly, I do not have a lift. 

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:51.349
 also to a staircase something 

00:05:49.909 --> 00:05:53.150
 so you go from one place to another and 

00:05:51.349 --> 00:05:54.560
 everything is open, and it is very 

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:56.330
 interesting and mansion were like that too 

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:58.550
 I'm almost sure it's going to be like this. 

00:05:56.330 --> 00:06:00.530
 and its image also shows how the 

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:02.750
 garage is well curved I do not know what they are 

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:04.820
 the partitions it has eight partitions I 

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:06.590
 I think maybe the top part of me 

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:07.610
 I understand very well what helps you there more 

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:09.710
 it is still very interesting to see the 

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:11.120
 format that will be the garage and 

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:13.219
 many players start to circulate 

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:15.229
 even how many cars could you put 

00:06:13.219 --> 00:06:17.690
 inside the garage in the apartments 

00:06:15.229 --> 00:06:19.009
 maximum of cars is 10 and has 

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:20.990
 many players who are saying that 

00:06:19.009 --> 00:06:24.380
 can fit more than 10 in the garage. 

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:26.180
 mansion where it is possible to have 12 14 or even more 

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:28.069
 imagine the question the video will be 

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:30.289
 exactly this galera how many cars 

00:06:28.069 --> 00:06:31.759
 Do you think you will have room to 

00:06:30.289 --> 00:06:33.349
 fit in that garage you are 

00:06:31.759 --> 00:06:35.030
 seeing through the images it appears a 

00:06:33.349 --> 00:06:36.710
 a little narrow but if you maybe 

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:38.780
 parking the car on its side may 

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:40.699
 position of the cars on the way 

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:42.919
 I think it fits in well over ten 

00:06:40.699 --> 00:06:45.050
 cars there if they had hair eight cars 

00:06:42.919 --> 00:06:46.430
 from each side up to 16 cars 

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:49.070
 So, like, I think it really fits. 

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:50.779
 enough vehicle and inside even the 

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:52.159
 Big As A Guard And Everything Else 

00:06:50.779 --> 00:06:52.710
 king's dream i think it would fit 

00:06:52.159 --> 00:06:54.600
 against 

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:56.400
 quality and inside but the question of 

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:58.110

00:06:56.400 --> 00:07:00.300
