00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:04.840 

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:07.650 

I<00:00:05.460> get<00:00:06.460> a<00:00:06.490> lot<00:00:06.670> of<00:00:06.790> questions<00:00:07.180> about<00:00:07.300> how<00:00:07.600> we

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:07.660 
I get a lot of questions about how we

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:10.709 
I get a lot of questions about how we
collect<00:00:08.050> pollen<00:00:08.440> and<00:00:09.450> so<00:00:10.450> this<00:00:10.600> is

00:00:10.709 --> 00:00:10.719 
collect pollen and so this is

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:12.629 
collect pollen and so this is
demonstration<00:00:11.440> of<00:00:11.590> what<00:00:11.800> a<00:00:11.830> pollen<00:00:12.160> collector

00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:12.639 
demonstration of what a pollen collector

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:15.450 
demonstration of what a pollen collector
is<00:00:13.380> this<00:00:14.380> hive<00:00:14.559> is<00:00:14.740> located<00:00:15.130> in<00:00:15.220> Winter<00:00:15.430> Park

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:15.460 
is this hive is located in Winter Park

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:18.330 
is this hive is located in Winter Park
Florida<00:00:16.560> you<00:00:17.560> probably<00:00:17.800> hear<00:00:17.950> the<00:00:18.099> train

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:18.340 
Florida you probably hear the train

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:23.100 
Florida you probably hear the train
going<00:00:19.000> by<00:00:19.119> in<00:00:19.270> the<00:00:19.390> distance<00:00:20.070> and<00:00:21.480> this<00:00:22.480> is<00:00:22.720> a

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:23.110 
going by in the distance and this is a

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:25.230 
going by in the distance and this is a
basic<00:00:23.619> pollen<00:00:24.190> trap<00:00:24.430> goes<00:00:24.760> on<00:00:24.910> the<00:00:25.000> front<00:00:25.210> of

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:25.240 
basic pollen trap goes on the front of

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:28.340 
basic pollen trap goes on the front of
the<00:00:25.330> hive<00:00:25.980> this<00:00:26.980> is<00:00:27.130> made<00:00:27.340> of<00:00:27.460> plastic<00:00:27.640> and

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:28.350 
the hive this is made of plastic and

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:30.359 
the hive this is made of plastic and
right<00:00:29.350> now<00:00:29.470> that<00:00:29.650> these<00:00:29.740> are<00:00:29.949> going<00:00:30.070> in<00:00:30.250> and

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:30.369 
right now that these are going in and

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:32.609 
right now that these are going in and
out<00:00:30.490> through<00:00:31.240> the<00:00:31.270> front<00:00:31.869> entrance<00:00:31.990> on<00:00:32.559> the

00:00:32.609 --> 00:00:32.619 
out through the front entrance on the

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:36.030 
out through the front entrance on the
hive<00:00:33.010> the<00:00:33.580> pollen<00:00:34.000> trap<00:00:34.210> is<00:00:34.420> open<00:00:35.010> so<00:00:36.010> now

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:36.040 
hive the pollen trap is open so now

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:38.400 
hive the pollen trap is open so now
we're<00:00:36.460> going<00:00:36.610> to<00:00:36.760> close<00:00:37.059> that<00:00:37.090> I'll<00:00:38.079> show<00:00:38.350> you

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:38.410 
we're going to close that I'll show you

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:51.020 
we're going to close that I'll show you
what<00:00:38.710> happens<00:00:39.930> now<00:00:40.930> the<00:00:40.989> pollens<00:00:41.380> collected

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.470 

so<00:00:51.420> now<00:00:51.630> there's<00:00:51.990> a<00:00:52.080> door<00:00:52.530> here<00:00:52.950> he<00:00:53.450> wants<00:00:54.450> to

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
so now there's a door here he wants to

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.130 
so now there's a door here he wants to
be<00:00:54.570> lower<00:00:54.780> that<00:00:55.050> and<00:00:55.290> put<00:00:56.010> it<00:00:56.040> in<00:00:56.190> place

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:57.140 
be lower that and put it in place

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.490 
be lower that and put it in place
bees<00:00:58.140> can<00:00:58.830> no<00:00:58.950> longer<00:00:59.160> pass<00:00:59.460> through<00:00:59.940> freely

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:00.500 
bees can no longer pass through freely

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.860 
bees can no longer pass through freely
but<00:01:01.500> instead<00:01:02.190> see<00:01:03.000> if<00:01:03.120> we<00:01:03.210> can<00:01:03.330> catch<00:01:03.600> one<00:01:03.840> of

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
but instead see if we can catch one of

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:12.170 
but instead see if we can catch one of
them<00:01:04.050> here<00:01:04.400> crawling<00:01:05.400> through

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.670 

instead<00:01:12.780> they're<00:01:12.930> going<00:01:12.990> to<00:01:13.110> crawl<00:01:13.380> through

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
instead they're going to crawl through

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:21.070 
instead they're going to crawl through
those<00:01:13.950> little<00:01:14.220> holes

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:21.080 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:22.870 

and<00:01:21.530> so<00:01:21.800> this<00:01:21.920> little<00:01:22.190> holes<00:01:22.370> are<00:01:22.580> designed

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:22.880 
and so this little holes are designed

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.030 
and so this little holes are designed
not<00:01:23.000> to<00:01:23.270> not<00:01:23.660> to<00:01:23.810> harm<00:01:24.020> the<00:01:24.200> bees<00:01:24.380> at<00:01:24.620> all<00:01:24.740> they

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:25.040 
not to not to harm the bees at all they

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:26.440 
not to not to harm the bees at all they
just<00:01:25.070> crawl<00:01:25.460> right<00:01:25.610> through<00:01:25.670> it<00:01:26.030> and<00:01:26.060> you<00:01:26.300> can

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:26.450 
just crawl right through it and you can

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:29.770 
just crawl right through it and you can
see<00:01:26.570> it's<00:01:26.690> pretty<00:01:26.810> easy<00:01:27.080> and<00:01:28.630> when<00:01:29.630> they're

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:29.780 
see it's pretty easy and when they're

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:33.310 
see it's pretty easy and when they're
coming<00:01:30.080> in<00:01:30.170> with<00:01:30.200> pollen<00:01:31.630> the<00:01:32.630> bees<00:01:32.840> are<00:01:33.140> going

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:33.320 
coming in with pollen the bees are going

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:35.980 
coming in with pollen the bees are going
the<00:01:33.920> bees<00:01:34.370> that<00:01:34.520> have<00:01:34.640> pollen<00:01:35.030> when<00:01:35.840> they

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990 
the bees that have pollen when they

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:37.510 
the bees that have pollen when they
crawl<00:01:36.230> through<00:01:36.440> the<00:01:36.710> pollen<00:01:37.010> is<00:01:37.100> going<00:01:37.280> to<00:01:37.400> get

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 
crawl through the pollen is going to get

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:42.670 
crawl through the pollen is going to get
knocked<00:01:37.730> off<00:01:39.100> of<00:01:40.100> their<00:01:40.670> legs<00:01:41.300> and<00:01:42.080> it<00:01:42.440> falls

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:42.680 
knocked off of their legs and it falls

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.730 
knocked off of their legs and it falls
down<00:01:42.890> through<00:01:43.340> the<00:01:43.460> trap<00:01:44.320> into<00:01:45.320> this<00:01:45.470> little

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740 
down through the trap into this little

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.600 
down through the trap into this little
tray

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:49.610 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:51.340 

and<00:01:49.910> of<00:01:50.060> course<00:01:50.300> that's<00:01:50.540> where<00:01:50.840> we<00:01:50.990> collect

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:51.350 
and of course that's where we collect

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:53.950 
and of course that's where we collect
the<00:01:51.710> pollen<00:01:51.920> you<00:01:52.400> can<00:01:52.550> see<00:01:52.700> some<00:01:52.970> of<00:01:53.210> all

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:53.960 
the pollen you can see some of all

00:01:53.960 --> 00:02:00.100 
the pollen you can see some of all
different<00:01:54.230> colors<00:01:56.620> starting<00:01:57.620> to<00:01:57.770> build<00:01:57.890> up
