00:00:13.979 --> 00:00:15.379
 so hello to you 

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:18.470
 friend of youtube small presentation of a lamp 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:19.989
 the route elsewhere 

00:00:19.989 --> 00:00:22.079
 the tht 60 

00:00:22.079 --> 00:00:25.409
 h 32 

00:00:25.409 --> 00:00:28.539
 excess of morning some 65 fashion 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:33.380
 1200 of the Maine with him the white fathers 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:38.150
 sold with a part m 

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:41.920
 no shadow 2200 lumens 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:43.660
 it's a strong lighting power 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:46.660
 I will show it 

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.490
 of the third-world 

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:54.810
 therefore fueled preferably with cyclical activities following 650 

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:56.540
 firefighters a homeland 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:59.540
 for one hour autonomy in motogp 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:04.120
 how to lengthen the heart a little 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:05.750
 show the end 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:07.710
 in low mode 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.710
 op 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.270
 a lamp with them 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.620
 for the match 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:21.620
 since I'm in talks to change the mode 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:25.160
 so 5 modest 

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:31.730
 at auckland 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:36.970
 the ticket is money 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:40.380
 a broad enough diffuser 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.380
 put it at the bottom 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:51.530
 after its lighting as you can see 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:57.650
 investigation 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:01.180
 six inches long 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:09.849
 and who is fed tamer a homeland of 10 8 652 of his pals 

00:02:11.669 --> 00:02:15.159
 from 1600 to earth 

00:02:15.159 --> 00:02:18.510
 as you know for those who use these people plant rage 

00:02:20.289 --> 00:02:24.549
 and the voltage which is very important for her request because otherwise she 

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:27.249
 not hold the net does not hold 

00:02:27.249 --> 00:02:30.669
 so he who has recidivated by going to hide relevant patients 

00:02:30.669 --> 00:02:33.669
 alone she stops 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:38.209
 so you play against that 

00:02:41.929 --> 00:02:44.929
 there are no 2 crowns of self defense have following 

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:48.349
 so I'm better 

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:51.679
 another subject is always cursing 

00:02:51.679 --> 00:02:55.439
 for the hike for me in the bag good for those who would have had no problem 

00:02:55.439 --> 00:02:56.069
 read 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:59.069
 it would be 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:05.599
 so all aluminum 

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:08.599
 eg of the choice for being toxic has come 

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:11.909
 at the end of the night 

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:14.269
 at the level of tennis to the dead for the time 

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:16.639
 for the slow too 

00:03:16.639 --> 00:03:19.309
 at the level and therefore the upper body 

00:03:19.309 --> 00:03:21.999
 if we have the intervention to be done on employment 

00:03:21.999 --> 00:03:24.999
 for repairs 

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:28.059
 of which four times in a row 

00:03:28.059 --> 00:03:31.059
 between friends of the lamp is the battery 

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:35.829
 which is very good 

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:38.639
 however, it still lacks a good enough size when you can 

00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:41.639
 note 

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:47.049
 15 centimeters 

00:03:47.789 --> 00:03:50.789
 which is very good 

00:03:56.989 --> 00:04:00.319
 why tests it so culmination in the night 

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:03.319
 with the tongue 

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:07.549
 the pib figure let's see that the lights of 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:26.150
 we can always 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:29.150
 way 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:32.990
 low mode 

00:04:34.439 --> 00:04:37.240
 your very weak then there 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:40.240
 we see nothing at all 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:58.740
 as for the score 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:09.240
 and singing motet under x 

00:05:21.069 --> 00:05:24.069
 the normal motte returns what 

00:06:15.499 --> 00:06:17.159
 m 

00:06:17.159 --> 00:06:20.159
 g 

00:07:31.869 --> 00:07:35.469
 hinse the camera does not capture everything since it points the opposition 

00:07:35.469 --> 00:07:37.710
 roland heguy 

00:07:37.710 --> 00:07:41.180
 but we call students at 150 meters 

00:07:42.809 --> 00:07:45.779
 lyon 

00:07:45.779 --> 00:07:48.779
 clio 

00:07:56.550 --> 00:07:59.740
 I think it costs well to realize with a camera is 

00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:02.740
 three priests 

00:08:06.169 --> 00:08:06.819
 Why
