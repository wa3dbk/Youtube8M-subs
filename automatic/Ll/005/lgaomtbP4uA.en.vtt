ease<00:00:24.769> transplantation<00:00:25.970> so<00:00:26.970> let's<00:00:27.180> get

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
ease transplantation so let's get

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.779 
ease transplantation so let's get
started<00:00:27.900> we<00:00:28.710> all<00:00:28.740> know<00:00:29.070> that<00:00:29.220> nursing<00:00:29.670> has

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
started we all know that nursing has

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.910 
started we all know that nursing has
advanced<00:00:30.330> quite<00:00:30.900> a<00:00:31.019> bit<00:00:31.320> from<00:00:31.529> the<00:00:31.710> days<00:00:31.890> of

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
advanced quite a bit from the days of

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.280 
advanced quite a bit from the days of
Florence<00:00:32.399> Nightingale<00:00:32.790> it<00:00:33.780> goes<00:00:33.960> without

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
Florence Nightingale it goes without

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
saying that during that year organ

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.840 
saying that during that year organ
transplant<00:00:37.230> was<00:00:37.380> obviously<00:00:37.920> unheard<00:00:38.340> of

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
transplant was obviously unheard of

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.869 
transplant was obviously unheard of
now<00:00:39.450> today<00:00:39.870> it's<00:00:40.110> just<00:00:40.230> a<00:00:40.559> normal<00:00:41.010> thing<00:00:41.250> for

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
now today it's just a normal thing for

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.369 
now today it's just a normal thing for
patients<00:00:42.059> to<00:00:42.450> have<00:00:42.600> different<00:00:43.020> organs

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
patients to have different organs

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.580 
patients to have different organs
transplanted<00:00:44.190> and<00:00:44.309> we<00:00:44.399> know<00:00:44.550> that<00:00:45.320> we<00:00:46.320> may<00:00:46.440> not

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
transplanted and we know that we may not

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.229 
transplanted and we know that we may not
all<00:00:46.800> encounter<00:00:47.190> the<00:00:47.550> one<00:00:47.730> who's<00:00:47.910> had<00:00:48.120> the

patient has had an organ transplanted

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.900 
patient has had an organ transplanted
because<00:01:00.680> it's<00:01:01.680> stressful<00:01:02.039> and<00:01:02.280> everyone<00:01:02.760> the

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
live with these transplants let's talk

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.310 
live with these transplants let's talk
about<00:01:25.890> the<00:01:26.490> patient<00:01:26.909> and<00:01:27.060> liver<00:01:27.240> failure

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
about the patient and liver failure

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.370 
about the patient and liver failure
these<00:01:29.100> patients<00:01:29.700> experience<00:01:30.380> certain

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
these patients experience certain

these patients experience certain
complications<00:01:32.190> like<00:01:32.550> Estero<00:01:33.450> 6<00:01:33.780> which<00:01:33.960> is

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
complications like Estero 6 which is

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.740 
complications like Estero 6 which is
also<00:01:34.290> known<00:01:34.620> as<00:01:34.770> liver<00:01:35.010> flap<00:01:35.430> when<00:01:36.180> the<00:01:36.360> extend

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
also known as liver flap when the extend

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.800 
also known as liver flap when the extend
their<00:01:36.900> fingers<00:01:37.320> door<00:01:37.530> hands<00:01:37.800> dorsiflexion

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:38.810 
their fingers door hands dorsiflexion

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:41.950 
their fingers door hands dorsiflexion
literally<00:01:39.810> flaps<00:01:40.140> like<00:01:40.500> the<00:01:40.680> wings<00:01:40.890> of<00:01:41.040> a<00:01:41.160> bird

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.510 
literally flaps like the wings of a bird
then<00:01:42.960> you<00:01:43.110> have<00:01:43.350> things<00:01:43.650> like<00:01:43.740> esophageal

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
then you have things like esophageal

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.830 
then you have things like esophageal
varices<00:01:44.900> resulting<00:01:45.900> in<00:01:46.020> swelling<00:01:46.770> in<00:01:47.400> the<00:01:48.240> of

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
varices resulting in swelling in the of

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.469 
varices resulting in swelling in the of
the<00:01:48.990> varices<00:01:49.530> in<00:01:50.220> the<00:01:50.400> esophagus<00:01:51.060> which<00:01:51.270> can

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
the varices in the esophagus which can

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.800 
the varices in the esophagus which can
rupture<00:01:51.990> leading<00:01:52.200> to<00:01:52.950> shock<00:01:53.300> and<00:01:54.300> then<00:01:54.509> how

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
rupture leading to shock and then how

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.760 
rupture leading to shock and then how
about<00:01:55.340> panic<00:01:56.360> encephalopathy<00:01:57.619> patients<00:01:58.619> may

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
about panic encephalopathy patients may

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.620 
about panic encephalopathy patients may
experience<00:01:59.720> lethargy<00:02:00.720> mental<00:02:01.440> confusion<00:02:01.680> and

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630 
experience lethargy mental confusion and

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.120 
experience lethargy mental confusion and
because<00:02:03.630> of<00:02:03.810> the<00:02:03.930> toxins<00:02:04.440> the<00:02:04.560> ammonia<00:02:04.860> which

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
because of the toxins the ammonia which

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.950 
because of the toxins the ammonia which
has<00:02:05.280> gone<00:02:05.490> to<00:02:05.550> the<00:02:05.789> brain<00:02:06.030> some<00:02:06.720> of<00:02:06.840> these

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
has gone to the brain some of these

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.180 
has gone to the brain some of these
patients<00:02:07.530> may<00:02:07.590> even<00:02:08.009> wind<00:02:08.280> up<00:02:08.520> having<00:02:09.090> to<00:02:09.390> have

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190 
patients may even wind up having to have

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:13.610 
patients may even wind up having to have
intracranial<00:02:11.190> pressure<00:02:11.610> monitoring<00:02:12.209> done<00:02:12.620> on

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
intracranial pressure monitoring done on

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.070 
intracranial pressure monitoring done on
the<00:02:13.830> right<00:02:14.010> hand<00:02:14.280> side<00:02:14.610> I<00:02:15.000> have<00:02:15.030> included<00:02:15.930> the

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
biliary tract you can see the liver

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.660 
biliary tract you can see the liver
which<00:02:18.510> is<00:02:18.660> made<00:02:18.870> up<00:02:18.989> of<00:02:19.080> four<00:02:19.350> lobes<00:02:19.620> the<00:02:20.430> liver

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
which is made up of four lobes the liver

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.580
