 for a first phase the national center 

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:21.650
 d development in research of leading technologies free software 

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:27.529
 and many much beyond free software the research and development of 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:30.529
 our own technology 

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:37.740
 plow

 in my office the blueprint prototype of an airplane 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:31.000
 an airplane to do it here us and because we can not do all those things 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:34.790
 according to our needs 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.329

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:53.840
 free 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:55.790
 the system 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:57.160
 stop 

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:00.160
