00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:16.990 
green like Katy Perry's hair I just took
it<00:02:15.110> out<00:02:15.380> and<00:02:15.410> then<00:02:15.680> I<00:02:16.040> cut<00:02:16.549> it<00:02:16.670> into<00:02:16.790> this

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
it out and then I cut it into this

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.030 
it out and then I cut it into this
triangle<00:02:17.600> and<00:02:17.900> each<00:02:18.410> side<00:02:18.650> of<00:02:18.739> the<00:02:18.799> triangle

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
triangle and each side of the triangle

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.670 
triangle and each side of the triangle
is<00:02:19.400> 2.5<00:02:20.180> inches<00:02:20.570> so<00:02:20.930> you<00:02:20.989> could<00:02:21.260> make<00:02:21.440> your<00:02:21.560> own

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
is 2.5 inches so you could make your own

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.680 
is 2.5 inches so you could make your own
stencil<00:02:22.190> it's<00:02:22.459> not<00:02:22.610> that<00:02:22.670> hard<00:02:22.970> I<00:02:23.209> figured<00:02:23.600> out

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
stencil it's not that hard I figured out

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:26.470 
stencil it's not that hard I figured out
how<00:02:23.750> to<00:02:23.900> do<00:02:24.079> it<00:02:24.230> which<00:02:24.739> shows<00:02:24.980> a<00:02:25.010> lot<00:02:25.370> then<00:02:26.000> you

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
how to do it which shows a lot then you

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.810 
how to do it which shows a lot then you
want<00:02:26.660> to<00:02:26.750> put<00:02:26.930> a<00:02:27.079> one<00:02:27.470> layer<00:02:27.680> of<00:02:27.709> Mod<00:02:28.220> Podge<00:02:28.250> on

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:28.820 
want to put a one layer of Mod Podge on

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:31.030 
want to put a one layer of Mod Podge on
the<00:02:29.329> notebook<00:02:29.720> and<00:02:30.019> then<00:02:30.290> you<00:02:30.560> want<00:02:30.739> to<00:02:30.769> start

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
the notebook and then you want to start

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.340 
the notebook and then you want to start
placing<00:02:31.340> the<00:02:31.640> triangles<00:02:32.299> I<00:02:32.480> did<00:02:32.989> it<00:02:33.079> in<00:02:33.200> like

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:33.350 
placing the triangles I did it in like

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:35.229 
placing the triangles I did it in like
opposite<00:02:34.010> order<00:02:34.250> but<00:02:34.579> of<00:02:34.730> course<00:02:34.970> you<00:02:35.090> could

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:35.239 
opposite order but of course you could

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:37.180 
opposite order but of course you could
do<00:02:35.329> it<00:02:35.450> anyway<00:02:35.870> that<00:02:36.019> you<00:02:36.140> like<00:02:36.470> but<00:02:36.920> I<00:02:36.950> thought

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
do it anyway that you like but I thought

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:42.009 
do it anyway that you like but I thought
this<00:02:37.280> was<00:02:37.910> really<00:02:38.299> cute<00:02:38.570> and<00:02:38.750> flirty<00:02:39.620> then<00:02:41.019> you

00:02:42.009 --> 00:02:42.019

just<00:02:42.170> want<00:02:42.290> to<00:02:42.350> cut<00:02:42.560> the<00:02:42.739> sides<00:02:43.040> to<00:02:43.459> make<00:02:43.549> sure

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
just want to cut the sides to make sure

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:45.880
