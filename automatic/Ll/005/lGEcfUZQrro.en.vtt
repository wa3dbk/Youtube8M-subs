00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
 clocks connected or smart 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:07.350
 they are the fashionable product a device 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.599
 that evolves constantly in the 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.730
 Today we have a formed ecosystem 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:14.490
 for android wear taiz solutions 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.440
 in the apple clock and also by the 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.240
 product of a small company that 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.539
 he did his homework very well with his first 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:24.240
 smart watch your baby name now after a 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.310
 new record beaten on kickstarter arrives 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.710
 at pebble time a clear evolution of the 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.080
 smart watch that offers more autonomy 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.120
 the current generation but not only that 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.950
 It also comes with many novelties 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.950
 what we analyze next 

00:00:38.339 --> 00:00:43.539
 ever time is a clear evolution in 

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:45.969
 Regarding the design and software line 

00:00:43.539 --> 00:00:48.339
 of the previous versions the pebble and 

00:00:45.969 --> 00:00:51.699
 the pebble steel on this occasion we have 

00:00:48.339 --> 00:00:53.859
 a light clock of only 42 grams with a 

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:56.320
 more ergonomic design and with novelty 

00:00:53.859 --> 00:00:59.079
 to integrate a color screen is 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:01.899
 resistant to water but the best thing is that 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:04.330
 it is compatible with ios and android to see 

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:06.610
 its frontal hits us that metal frame 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:09.460
 polished with a matt finish that encloses 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:12.009
 the screen 'color paper a screen 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:14.710
 transflective using ambient light 

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:16.840
 to be seen even though he has 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:19.630
 the help of some leds for when there 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:22.240
 little light this screen has the advantage 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:25.149
 inherent in the paper technology that 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:27.459
 offers a low consumption in operation 

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:29.830
 that makes it possible for them to show now 

00:01:27.459 --> 00:01:32.560
 every moment and enjoy a 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:34.840
 theoretical autonomy of up to 7 days a 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:36.929
 data that in our tests we can already 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:39.429
 overtake that almost has been fulfilled 

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:41.709
 made of polycarbonate with finishing 

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:43.720
 mate we have three buttons on the side 

00:01:41.709 --> 00:01:46.180
 right and one on the left side 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:48.040
 with them we will interact with the clock and 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:50.260
 Also if you have an Android smartphone 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:53.560
 you can take advantage of the microphone 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:55.840
 integrated to answer sms emails and 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:58.600
 voice notifications because 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:00.400
 transcribe the message you say level 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:03.220
 time also comes with a crystal 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:05.710
 gorilla glass that protects the screen a 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:08.440
 detail of thanks because it prevents damage 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:10.350
 against bumps and rubbing something that our 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.760
 daily use we have been able to check 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:15.580
 Regarding the software is not Android Wear 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:17.740
 nor do you have any ties but yes 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:19.690
 offers a very own operating system 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:22.300
 optimized for the modest hardware of the 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:25.000
 watch that is able to work so much 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:27.430
 with android terminals like years bb the 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.380
 23 is a breakthrough versus versions 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:31.930
 Previous pebble with this version 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:33.700
 we have a timeline that is accessed with 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:35.830
 the buttons up and down the side 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.890
 right and that shows us the events 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:40.510
 past and future of our calendar 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:42.250
 announcements of new appointments or calls 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:45.430
 losses that we have had previously 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:48.100
 for example as you can see we have a 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:50.530
 series of colorful animations that yes 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:52.750
 Well, they are not childish 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:54.640
 certain life the clock from the smart 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:56.470
 watch we can also access the menu 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.510
 main from the main sphere 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:01.120
 by pressing the middle button on the side 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:03.340
 right and browse the sections as 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:05.410
 configuration notifications the 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:08.230
 music control of the smartphone the 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:09.819
 change of sphere or applications that 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:12.160
 you can install from the application 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:14.080
 mobile pebble time valuing their 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:16.660
 integration with the two systems that 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:18.910
 supports the use next to an iphone has 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:21.190
 disappointed the null possibility of 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:23.739
 integration with absence notifications 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:26.260
 of voice response support and others 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:28.330
 details make you lose points if you 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:30.400
 We compare how he behaves with 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:33.010
 Android on the smartphones that use the 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:35.140
 google system we have a smart watch 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:37.180
 quite complete that allows 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:38.350
 interact with notifications that you 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:41.080
 Notifies by a vibration 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:43.090
 configurable in intensity and offers 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:45.850
 functionalities similar to andrew wear 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:48.310
 except for the sports section and 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:50.530
 quantification in those pebble sections 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:53.230
 It stays a little short natively 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:54.850
 although it can be alleviated thanks to the use of 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:56.410
 third - party applications such as 

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:58.630
 example misfits 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:01.480
 the smart watch does have 

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:03.610
 accelerometer to count steps those 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:05.350
 third-party applications or even the 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:07.240
 spheres of which has a great 

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:09.670
 heritage catalog of previous models 

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:11.620
 they are all installable from the 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:14.110
 pebble time application that we are going to 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:15.910
 install on our smartphone but what 

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:18.610
 best of pebble time versus the 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:21.040
 competition of the sector is that we have a 

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:23.170
 Notifier clock with functionalities 

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:25.750
 advanced applications to expand 

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:28.300
 functions and the ability to maintain 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:31.930
 the screen on at all times 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:32.380
 offering an autonomy between 5 and 7 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:35.290
 days 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:37.630
 all with active vibration and a high 

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:40.450
 number of daily notifications without 

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:42.280
 tell that in addition to load only 

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:45.340
 it needs little more than an hour 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:48.040
 ultimately pebble time we like to 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:50.740
 made an alternative android wear each 

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:52.780
 time more present is always welcome and 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:55.210
 have to forget about the obligation to 

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:56.350
 uploading another device daily is something 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:58.750
 that makes us even happier 

00:04:56.350 --> 00:05:01.120
 pebble time is an interesting evolution 

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:03.220
 in front of but original and one 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:05.680
 recommended alternative for users 

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:08.950
 android and something short in our opinion 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:11.860
 If you are a user of them yes to a 

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:13.900
 price that is 150 euros from smart 

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:16.440
 Apple's most basic watch is for 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:16.440
 think about it
