00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.419
 hi nice that you look at couples again 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:05.580
 talk tv today i'm gonna show you how 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:07.230
 you can step in the right way and 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.540
 maybe i'll go a bit too 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.250
 to drive 

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:13.110
 this is canasta dvb that you still have 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.580
 not seen my new assistant and 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.199
 I already completely saddled it up 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.359
 and if you want to know how you do that look 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.830
 then saddle up to my video 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.320
 at the very first I put my braces on 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.060
 do it down there and see if they 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.279
 be long enough that I do because of my 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.930
 finger at the base of the bracket too 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.060
 lay there with my other hand I draw 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.990
 him my armpits that fits that is that long 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.940
 enough 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.710
 your brackets should be about the same 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.910
 be tall if you are poor 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.840
 I'm still a hole aansingelen 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.840
 and I can get it 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.520
 as you can see canasta is incredibly 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.070
 large therefore I have a stool with me and 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.510
 I will use it when I go out 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.129
 I first take us my reins 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.539
 my left hand together with a plug male 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.879
 but you can also take the front of you 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.680
 hold the saddle then I go with my back 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.149
 standing on horse's head 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.489
 when I'm with my right hand my 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.320
 bracket and it turns to me there 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.820
 I use my left foot 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.949
 and then the back of the flock 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.260
 I then get off and then wave 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:12.119
 my leg is high over them and you have to 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:13.860
 make sure your leg lifts and go quietly 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:16.939
 sit now I am ready to ride 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.939
 want to see your piece 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:29.549
 Which 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:32.399
 Yes 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:16.010
 that you enjoyed seeing and who 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:17.750
 So you know how to do it the right way 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.920

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.930
