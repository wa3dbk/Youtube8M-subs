00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.860
 beautiful fully automatic machine siemens in it 

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:11.889
 piano black 

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:16.470
 that's what it's called with stainless steel 

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:20.680
 accents on the spout it is called the ecu 7 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:23.680
 plus and we'll see what that means 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:24.910
 because a lot can be done with this one 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:27.670
 machine 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:29.830
 when I look here in the minute where 

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:33.190
 I now stand at two in the beginning 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:35.319
 espresso 2 larger coffee 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:39.179
 one and so I can do it completely civilian 

00:00:35.319 --> 00:00:39.179
 a coffee even coffee wrong 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:46.569
 caffe macchiato cappuccino my coffee and 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:49.449
 that means that you can use it for coffee 

00:00:46.569 --> 00:00:52.120
 set the way you want it 

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:54.459
 then it is programmed for you 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:56.829
 look here for example user can 

00:00:54.459 --> 00:00:58.959
 name number 1 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:01.179
 already go to work to become him like that 

00:00:58.959 --> 00:01:03.940
 say that he is easy with that 

00:01:01.179 --> 00:01:06.609
 further we can have and maintenance 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:08.950
 program which states cleaning and 

00:01:06.609 --> 00:01:11.859
 service ok short rinse milk system 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:13.090
 start now is also not difficult, especially if 

00:01:11.859 --> 00:01:14.439
 you press start he will do that 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:16.270
 lime and clean is one 

00:01:14.439 --> 00:01:18.460
 descaling program 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:20.829
 you add the product and the machine 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:23.490
 it works entirely 

00:01:20.829 --> 00:01:23.490
 neatly 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:30.759
 then read the information, press 

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:34.509
 the i and you will see it descaled in the formula 

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:36.369
 to 120 cups and to be cleaned after 199 there 

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:37.570
 no filter is used because there 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:40.030
 we then opted for 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:43.060
 you will be informed and it will jump 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:44.469
 automatically returns to the main menu 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:46.719
 and what we naturally always want 

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:50.170
 know there will be a good espresso worth 

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:52.719
 but then everything is really good because 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:56.770
 that this machine through it 

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:58.929
 collapse of the spout and resources 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:00.850
 can make a wonderful cappuccino 

00:01:58.929 --> 00:02:04.090
 and perhaps the most beautiful milk froth 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:06.330
 we already know for all brands 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:09.510
 a while 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:09.510
 first an espresso 

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:15.940
 we still have 4 beans 

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:19.990
 we are going to see what he does the mill is 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:22.810
 extremely quiet and that actually comes 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:25.420
 by this rubber edge that provides 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:28.270
 a very good sound seal 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:31.440
 you can also see the adjustment here 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:31.440
 from the grinder 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:50.440
 I was ready for that 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.440
 the color is beautifully flamed 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:55.040
 he has a strong cream layer and me 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:56.810
 also think a strong coffee 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:58.730
 that was on in decimus if you are still on 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:01.390
 hot tuned him up for a while 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:01.390
 now think that 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:08.450
 very careful indeed 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:13.450
 nice and hot also marries 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:13.450
 taste good through a really thick coffee 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:20.690
 which is also very handy that you necessarily 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:22.099
 became a kemna on espresso but stand up 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:24.170
 you can do that with every goal 

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:25.550
 once on a regular coffee small and 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:26.900
 adjust completely to your own preferences 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:29.390
 it is now on 4 beans 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:32.660
 well i think someone is drinking that coffee 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:34.160
 so that is that it is slightly slack 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:35.930
 type of coffee I will just say 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:37.940
 more ordinary coffee 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:42.310
 you would put me on 3 beans instead 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:46.100
 of or four or five and the amount 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:48.970
 I think I would leave that then 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:51.290
 I didn't all bother with that well 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:53.830
 then I adjusted it like that 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:53.830
 must be made 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:00.599
 You can water bowl with a large handle 

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:02.340
 easy lifting it is also large 

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:05.780
 because has 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:05.780
 2.1 liter capacity 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:11.849
 the bean container 3 us 300 whole 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:14.610
 grams with beans and above 

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:15.840
 there is that adjustment mechanism every time 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:18.209
 nice to set 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:21.150
 at least I call that nice and fine than the 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:23.550
 At least I get a nice extraction 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:26.430
 here you can place a ground coffee 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:28.620
 administer per 2 servings 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:32.900
 which is also shown on the display 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:32.900
 that spoons included 

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:38.880
 important that you know you a little bit 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:40.470
 to commit there 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:42.690
 you saw that in the cleaning and 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:46.440
 descale menu but there is one here 

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:50.729
 brew group and this brew group 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:52.290
 you need to get it out every week 

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:53.910
 get through this you write 

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:57.240
 to the press you on it, you can 

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:58.979
 remove the brew group and this brew group 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:01.770
 should you please he is still nice and clean 

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:02.640
 now with lukewarm water once a week 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:04.350
 clean 

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:05.970
 put it in the sinks as in the evening 

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:07.979
 Then you get that morning dry 

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:12.570
 no mold and now we also put it 

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:15.240
 very easy again in lever to 

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:18.210
 back cover closed 

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:19.680
 rest in the weekly if not daily 

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:21.810
 maintenance 

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:25.260
 depending on him google drinks coffee 

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:27.240
 in day the water is the barge 

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:28.320
 and the bin where you put the coffee cookies 

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:31.950
 are collected 

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:34.200
 and if they look that way round and dry 

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:36.090
 then i can tell you the mill 

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:38.400
 excellent tuned and that you have one 

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:40.500
 good bonus shirt 

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:42.000
 best apart from this device is that i 

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:43.889
 can say something nice about the 

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.389
 hot plate with I on and on 

00:05:43.889 --> 00:05:46.760
 disable this is an active one 

00:05:45.389 --> 00:05:49.710
 hot plate that its own 

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:50.490
 has a heating element and therefore a 

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:53.250
 real one 

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:55.740
 hot plate is very important it is 

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:57.870
 maintenance of your coffee machine 

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:59.770
 in addition to rinsing the brewing group 

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:02.110
 you must descale 

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:04.569
 assume six or six times a year 

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:08.800
 so very important every two months 

00:06:04.569 --> 00:06:10.389
 is that you also descale it 

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:12.310
 the machine also several times a year 

00:06:10.389 --> 00:06:17.740
 needs cleaning 

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:20.470
 that happens with can pill and this pill 

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:22.539
 depending on the machine is also 

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:24.069
 often added to the water or in one 

00:06:22.539 --> 00:06:26.259
 separate box 

00:06:24.069 --> 00:06:27.940
 Of course this descaling set is for 

00:06:26.259 --> 00:06:30.030
 a whole year of care with us 

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:30.030
 to gain 

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:37.310
 so then have an espresso latte 

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:38.680
 macchiato cappuccino or a regular cup 

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:41.680
 coffee from 

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:41.680
