00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
bear but it was fairly impulsive when I

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.920 
bear but it was fairly impulsive when I
bought<00:01:31.710> it<00:01:31.740> to<00:01:31.980> be<00:01:32.100> honest<00:01:32.340> but<00:01:32.580> so<00:01:32.970> is<00:01:33.390> pretty

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
bought it to be honest but so is pretty

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.990 
bought it to be honest but so is pretty
cool<00:01:34.200> and<00:01:34.620> if<00:01:35.340> you've<00:01:35.490> got<00:01:35.670> the<00:01:35.730> money<00:01:35.820> to

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
cool and if you've got the money to

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.320 
cool and if you've got the money to
spend<00:01:36.120> why<00:01:36.630> not<00:01:36.890> because<00:01:37.890> when<00:01:38.790> the<00:01:38.910> film<00:01:39.120> came

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:39.330 
spend why not because when the film came

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:41.060 
spend why not because when the film came
out<00:01:39.540> I<00:01:39.840> did<00:01:40.110> if<00:01:40.230> you<00:01:40.260> see<00:01:40.500> someone<00:01:40.800> he's

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
out I did if you see someone he's

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.850 
out I did if you see someone he's
available<00:01:41.430> and<00:01:42.030> I<00:01:42.780> think<00:01:43.590> they<00:01:43.740> would

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
available and I think they would

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.500 
available and I think they would
probably<00:01:43.920> even<00:01:44.340> more<00:01:44.610> than<00:01:44.790> faffing<00:01:45.420> that

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:45.510 
probably even more than faffing that

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:48.680 
probably even more than faffing that
were<00:01:45.570> close<00:01:45.780> to<00:01:45.990> 100<00:01:47.180> you<00:01:48.180> know<00:01:48.270> with<00:01:48.420> the<00:01:48.480> film

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:48.690 
were close to 100 you know with the film

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:50.060 
were close to 100 you know with the film
coming<00:01:48.900> out<00:01:49.020> it<00:01:49.290> was<00:01:49.440> probably<00:01:49.680> our<00:01:49.770> demand

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
coming out it was probably our demand

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.290 
coming out it was probably our demand
for<00:01:50.310> it<00:01:50.400> I<00:01:50.430> guess<00:01:50.600> but<00:01:51.980> he<00:01:52.980> quickly<00:01:53.850> became

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:54.300 
for it I guess but he quickly became

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:56.600 
for it I guess but he quickly became
unavailable<00:01:54.660> and<00:01:55.260> I<00:01:55.620> was<00:01:55.740> kind<00:01:55.920> of<00:01:55.950> like<00:01:56.100> you

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
unavailable and I was kind of like you

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.940 
unavailable and I was kind of like you
know<00:01:56.670> why<00:01:56.850> should<00:01:57.030> I<00:01:57.090> buy<00:01:57.240> it<00:01:57.650> was<00:01:58.650> not<00:01:58.740> to

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
know why should I buy it was not to

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.220 
know why should I buy it was not to
spend<00:01:59.300> so<00:02:00.300> cost<00:02:00.450> when<00:02:00.600> I<00:02:00.660> was<00:02:00.780> even<00:02:00.930> Forbidden

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
them and he was only 50 so I figured you

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.880 
them and he was only 50 so I figured you
know<00:02:08.940> what<00:02:09.030> the<00:02:09.149> hell<00:02:09.300> what<00:02:10.200> a<00:02:10.229> regret<00:02:10.619> if<00:02:10.800> I

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
know what the hell what a regret if I
