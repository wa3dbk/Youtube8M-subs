00:00:16.339 --> 00:00:16.349 
a little bit at LHC because well it's

00:00:16.349 --> 00:00:17.690 
a little bit at LHC because well it's
been<00:00:16.500> a<00:00:16.529> very<00:00:16.590> long<00:00:16.920> time<00:00:17.310> since<00:00:17.520> i've<00:00:17.670> posted

we're<00:00:25.800> at<00:00:25.920> a<00:00:25.949> glitched<00:00:26.400> map<00:00:26.670> I<00:00:26.850> believe<00:00:27.090> that

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
we're at a glitched map I believe that

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.179 
we're at a glitched map I believe that
crock<00:00:27.480> ease<00:00:27.720> and<00:00:28.080> I've<00:00:28.650> never<00:00:28.830> been<00:00:29.010> in<00:00:29.160> a

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
crock ease and I've never been in a

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.070 
crock ease and I've never been in a
glitch<00:00:29.460> map<00:00:29.699> before<00:00:29.910> but<00:00:30.359> it<00:00:30.480> was<00:00:30.660> quite

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
glitch map before but it was quite

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.040 
glitch map before but it was quite
intense<00:00:31.500> there's<00:00:31.949> a<00:00:32.070> lot<00:00:32.129> of<00:00:32.309> monsters<00:00:32.790> and

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:33.050 
intense there's a lot of monsters and

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:36.650 
intense there's a lot of monsters and
yeah<00:00:34.050> it<00:00:34.290> was<00:00:34.410> very<00:00:34.470> glitched<00:00:35.040> there<00:00:35.910> and<00:00:36.360> it

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
yeah it was very glitched there and it

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.240 
yeah it was very glitched there and it
was<00:00:36.750> kind<00:00:37.320> of<00:00:37.440> hard<00:00:37.620> for<00:00:37.710> me<00:00:37.830> to<00:00:37.949> hit<00:00:38.070> things

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
was kind of hard for me to hit things

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.640 
was kind of hard for me to hit things
actually<00:00:38.549> I<00:00:38.760> had<00:00:38.970> a<00:00:39.470> almost<00:00:40.470> kind<00:00:40.620> of

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:40.650 
actually I had a almost kind of

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:42.410 
actually I had a almost kind of
struggling<00:00:40.949> in<00:00:41.040> this<00:00:41.100> video<00:00:41.370> because<00:00:41.549> well<00:00:42.390> I

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:38.210 
things that seem good but things that
also<00:03:36.090> seem<00:03:36.419> bad<00:03:36.659> too<00:03:36.989> because<00:03:37.470> a<00:03:37.620> lot<00:03:37.889> of<00:03:37.919> stuff

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
also seem bad too because a lot of stuff

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.939 
also seem bad too because a lot of stuff
guys<00:03:38.430> are<00:03:38.699> blessings<00:03:39.180> in<00:03:39.419> disguise<00:03:39.449> and<00:03:40.259> we

00:03:40.939 --> 00:03:40.949 
guys are blessings in disguise and we

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:43.429 
guys are blessings in disguise and we
tend<00:03:41.159> to<00:03:41.250> look<00:03:41.340> at<00:03:41.639> things<00:03:42.479> that<00:03:43.019> we<00:03:43.229> don't

00:03:43.429 --> 00:03:43.439 
tend to look at things that we don't

00:03:43.439 --> 00:03:46.610 
tend to look at things that we don't
have<00:03:43.739> and<00:03:44.509> we<00:03:45.509> tend<00:03:45.720> to<00:03:45.840> take<00:03:46.049> things<00:03:46.109> for

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
have and we tend to take things for

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.499 
have and we tend to take things for
granted<00:03:46.650> a<00:03:47.129> little<00:03:47.370> too<00:03:47.609> much<00:03:47.909> in<00:03:48.090> this<00:03:48.180> world

00:03:48.499 --> 00:03:48.509 
granted a little too much in this world

00:03:48.509 --> 00:03:51.170 
granted a little too much in this world
and<00:03:48.750> I<00:03:49.500> think<00:03:49.799> that<00:03:50.040> if<00:03:50.250> we<00:03:50.310> just<00:03:50.699> started<00:03:51.030> to

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
and I think that if we just started to

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.420 
and I think that if we just started to
view<00:03:51.419> our<00:03:51.449> cup<00:03:51.840> as<00:03:52.079> half<00:03:52.439> full<00:03:52.739> instead<00:03:52.979> of

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
view our cup as half full instead of

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:56.420 
view our cup as half full instead of
half<00:03:53.729> empty<00:03:54.000> that<00:03:54.840> the<00:03:55.229> world<00:03:55.500> and<00:03:55.829> our<00:03:56.129> lives

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430 
half empty that the world and our lives

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:59.469 
half empty that the world and our lives
could<00:03:56.879> be<00:03:56.939> a<00:03:57.060> lot<00:03:57.419> more<00:03:57.500> easier<00:03:58.500> to<00:03:58.769> live<00:03:58.919> in<00:03:59.069> um

00:03:59.469 --> 00:03:59.479 
could be a lot more easier to live in um

00:03:59.479 --> 00:04:03.589 
could be a lot more easier to live in um
because<00:04:00.500> we<00:04:01.500> live<00:04:01.769> a<00:04:01.979> life<00:04:02.219> that<00:04:02.519> we<00:04:03.269> always

00:04:03.589 --> 00:04:03.599 
because we live a life that we always

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:05.899 
because we live a life that we always
want<00:04:04.049> want<00:04:04.469> want<00:04:04.620> more<00:04:05.189> and<00:04:05.489> more<00:04:05.519> and<00:04:05.699> more

00:04:05.899 --> 00:04:05.909 
want want want more and more and more

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:08.539 
want want want more and more and more
