 happened and it's okay let's 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:23.000
 now we are immediately to the point I think many 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:25.859
 noticed that my videos don't go out and 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.340
 someone knows someone not because I 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:32.610
 wrote in the VKontakte group what I am now 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.620
 busy what am i doing new year game to 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.190
 Sorry until the new year I do not do 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.160
 managed 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:43.140
 but finally I did it already as 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:45.020
 you see i go very long and let's 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.270
 we find out that this is what we played 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:51.620
 the game we have is called New Year's 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:56.449
 there is a lot of competition 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:59.730
 it is written here the meaning of the game I paint 

00:00:56.449 --> 00:01:02.039
 then paint how to play but I give it to you 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.059
 Now I'll tell you everything and of course here 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.510
 we are written and 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:11.850
 Maravila here and now I will tell you that 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:15.830
 why and why the point is that we 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:17.550
 We play for Santa Claus and we distribute 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:21.450
 presents 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:25.320
 at home and around the house 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:29.790
 in total we have 21 houses on the map and 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:34.100
 only one can be attributed to each house 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:38.520
 a gift and who more will spread our 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:43.200
 gifts and he won here so here 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:45.960
 Us meaning and as you would understand here 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.530
 that this game we have is designed for two 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.070
 players 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:53.630
 what I took is then called 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:56.900
 I wanted to take the pressure plate as 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:02:01.890
 to start playing by the way yes very 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:02.490
 it's important to still play on peace and when you 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.910
 play 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:09.540
 you need to remember your color then 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:12.870
 Well, there are now so you learn to play 

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:15.210
 we started we need to get up together 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:17.340
 on the plates but since with me there are not two more 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:20.430
 player I will put here this little thing 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:24.020
 and activate in this case 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:27.450
 I'm playing for blue now but take 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:30.120
 find and what we see is given to us 21 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:33.150
 a piece of sand from so a flock 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:36.630
 that is, and the sand is we have gifts and 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:40.800
 Fingal what are our very expensive gifts 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:43.230
 not that that that that okay it seemed to me and 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:47.310
 so what are we doing now we 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:49.620
 run up and start spreading issuing 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:52.049
 our gifts 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:55.470
 let's say i will order here in this house 

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:57.810
 and see blue and red yes 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:02.250
 have we play for blue i put 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:07.110
 here is our gift and we are credited a point 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:12.269
 and another player here is the second gift 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:17.069
 here no longer insert and also we see that 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:20.909
 what the lamp lights up what's already here 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:21.569
 there is a gift here and here so here we are 

00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:25.920
 running around 

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:30.840
 we carry these gifts and I want to notice 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:32.040
 the fact that the rest of the house is about to 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:35.129
 here in these two 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:39.299
 this one and this one you are not so easy 

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:43.890
 come by because then others 

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:48.480
 at home you have to do something there 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:51.840
 such as small puzzles something like 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:54.720
 this and or you need for example to climb 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:58.049
 let's say so that I can go there 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:04:00.209
 put your gift that is in 

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:04.769
 the rest of the house you just do not go 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:06.440
 this is also pretty good 

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:09.660
 complexity 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:12.329
 api youtube well shorter here and so we 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:16.709
 there hall 1 let's say I climbed here 

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:22.680
 shake and also put this let's put 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:25.830
 one more leave us also credited 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:27.960
 point and the lamp lights up and let's look 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:34.680
 as we have. 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:38.510
 for whose merges by the way this is ours 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:40.789
 counter so to speak it is designed for 

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:43.440
 for 12 points 

00:04:40.789 --> 00:04:46.440
 I apologize to him will call it as said 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:49.650
 what to wear you can dial a maximum of 12 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:51.300
 points that is when our sand 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:52.449
 comes to yellow 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:56.520
 wool 

00:04:52.449 --> 00:04:59.740
 it means something that we scored 12 points 

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:04.199
 as we see we scored only two points 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:06.789
 yes yes here it is two points 

00:05:04.199 --> 00:05:09.430
 is here with us see 

00:05:06.789 --> 00:05:13.779
 and here we have a zero and let's for the sake of 

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:19.809
 purely for interest we deliver yes we 

00:05:13.779 --> 00:05:23.050
 put we put our gift in 

00:05:19.809 --> 00:05:27.539
 that is, here and look at the red zone 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:27.539
 will they give us about what my house 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:32.199
 as we see yes we have singles then 

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:37.110
 there is so here so here so here we are 

00:05:32.199 --> 00:05:41.469
 We play and when when in all houses there is 

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:44.620
 gifts we go to the podium 

00:05:41.469 --> 00:05:48.060
 and look who has this pillar above who 

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:50.740
 he is higher than that and won such 

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:54.850
 simple game Well, how it would not seem 

00:05:50.740 --> 00:06:00.250
 hard but i think here 

00:05:54.850 --> 00:06:04.810
 as it is on what to think, and so on 

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:07.790
 also when i give here 

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:13.300
 I'll also put a gift to something 

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:20.210
 what they saw here all look more comfortable 

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:24.010
 when we are here one more when we finish the 

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:27.260
 and saw in and saw who won and 

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:30.370
 want to play again, we click on the button 

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:36.039
 reset here it is the question button we have glasses 

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:38.600
 dumped here and also carefully 

00:06:36.039 --> 00:06:42.770
 digging the lamp went out and 

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:46.699
 it means that there is no rita here 

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:48.880
 gifts they are no longer anywhere in every home 

00:06:46.699 --> 00:06:54.010
 they disappear on how they disappear 

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:59.840
 disappear in general, that's such a game 

00:06:54.010 --> 00:07:04.370
 I hope you will like it well and I think 

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:08.150
 all oh yeah i think know still what if you 

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:11.900
 It will be interesting, I will shoot about the mechanisms 

00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:14.300
 which I use in this game or rather 

00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:19.039
 used all the mechanisms that are here 

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:23.030
 used i thought them up with me then 

00:07:19.039 --> 00:07:29.070
 I have not climbed any tutorials anywhere 

00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:34.870
