so goes down to pretty deep in the end a
few<00:00:36.630> little<00:00:36.780> rails<00:00:37.079> around<00:00:37.260> the<00:00:37.500> outside<00:00:37.890> as

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340

too<00:00:43.110> low<00:00:43.320> kind<00:00:43.860> of<00:00:44.010> makes<00:00:44.160> it<00:00:44.309> hard<00:00:44.520> to<00:00:44.610> hit

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730

like<00:00:45.000> you<00:00:45.239> see<00:00:45.420> here<00:00:45.629> the<00:00:45.750> coping<00:00:46.110> actually

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
like you see here the coping actually

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.880 
like you see here the coping actually
goes<00:00:46.829> into<00:00:47.160> the<00:00:47.280> other<00:00:47.430> coping<00:00:47.760> almost<00:00:48.890> that's

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
goes into the other coping almost that's

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.200 
goes into the other coping almost that's
the<00:00:50.129> case<00:00:50.309> but<00:00:50.550> pretty<00:00:50.730> much<00:00:50.789> all<00:00:51.030> these

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
the case but pretty much all these

little down ledges that would have been
really<00:00:52.829> really<00:00:52.860> fun<00:00:53.190> if<00:00:53.370> it<00:00:53.489> would<00:00:53.610> just<00:00:53.850> read

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
parks built earlier in Vegas the coping

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.460 
parks built earlier in Vegas the coping
is<00:01:43.259> pretty<00:01:44.100> much<00:01:44.310> at<00:01:44.549> or<00:01:45.420> in<00:01:45.570> some<00:01:45.840> cases<00:01:46.079> right

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
is pretty much at or in some cases right

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.660 
is pretty much at or in some cases right
below<00:01:46.920> the<00:01:48.710> top<00:01:49.710> of<00:01:49.829> the<00:01:49.890> concrete<00:01:50.070> so<00:01:50.520> it's<00:01:50.640> a

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
below the top of the concrete so it's a

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.399 
below the top of the concrete so it's a
little<00:01:50.880> hard<00:01:51.030> to<00:01:51.090> skate<00:01:51.420> as<00:01:51.630> far<00:01:51.810> as<00:01:51.930> using<00:01:52.200> it

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
little hard to skate as far as using it

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.920 
little hard to skate as far as using it
like<00:01:52.560> a<00:01:52.590> quarter<00:01:52.950> pipe<00:01:53.100> sometimes<00:01:53.930> okay

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
like a quarter pipe sometimes okay

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.179

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
corner sometimes you'll find that table

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.499 
corner sometimes you'll find that table
move<00:01:58.920> places<00:01:59.430> where<00:01:59.579> you<00:01:59.640> can<00:01:59.820> skate<00:02:00.270> it<00:02:00.390> and
