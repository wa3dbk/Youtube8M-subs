underneath<00:00:57.090> your<00:00:57.530> passenger<00:00:58.530> seat<00:00:59.570> and<00:01:00.890> the

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
underneath your passenger seat and the

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.179 
underneath your passenger seat and the
block<00:01:02.129> is<00:01:02.370> basically<00:01:02.699> towards<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:03.719> driver

00:01:04.179 --> 00:01:04.189 
block is basically towards the driver

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:06.500 
block is basically towards the driver
you<00:01:05.189> have<00:01:05.280> to<00:01:05.430> take<00:01:05.580> these<00:01:05.909> are<00:01:06.060> ten<00:01:06.299> mill

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
you have to take these are ten mill

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:13.640 
you have to take these are ten mill
there<00:01:07.010> to<00:01:08.150> take<00:01:09.150> them<00:01:09.330> out<00:01:12.380> plate<00:01:13.380> over<00:01:13.500> there

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
there to take them out plate over there

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.249 
there to take them out plate over there
put<00:01:14.220> everything<00:01:14.430> out<00:01:14.610> of<00:01:14.670> your<00:01:14.820> weight<00:01:15.259> and

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
put everything out of your weight and

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:21.289 
put everything out of your weight and
there's<00:01:16.470> your<00:01:16.680> spark<00:01:16.920> plugs<00:01:17.189> and<00:01:20.090> as<00:01:21.090> you<00:01:21.180> can

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
there's your spark plugs and as you can

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.620 
there's your spark plugs and as you can
see<00:01:21.979> there<00:01:22.979> are<00:01:23.159> one<00:01:24.119> thing<00:01:24.299> that<00:01:24.479> these

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
see there are one thing that these

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.749 
see there are one thing that these
things<00:01:24.869> do<00:01:25.200> tend<00:01:25.740> to<00:01:25.830> leak<00:01:26.040> is<00:01:26.220> you<00:01:26.400> can<00:01:26.549> see

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
things do tend to leak is you can see

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.140 
things do tend to leak is you can see
right<00:01:26.909> here<00:01:27.080> it's<00:01:28.080> the<00:01:28.200> valve<00:01:28.409> cover<00:01:28.939> gasket<00:01:29.939> I

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
right here it's the valve cover gasket I

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.630 
right here it's the valve cover gasket I
might<00:01:30.840> change<00:01:31.049> it<00:01:31.259> out<00:01:31.470> tighten<00:01:32.310> check<00:01:32.520> them

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
might change it out tighten check them

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.429 
might change it out tighten check them
out<00:01:32.729> and<00:01:32.909> there<00:01:33.150> I<00:01:33.390> meet<00:01:33.810> with<00:01:33.930> so<00:01:34.079> many<00:01:34.170> miles

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
out and there I meet with so many miles

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:35.960 
out and there I meet with so many miles
and<00:01:34.860> kilometers

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
and kilometers

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.100 
and kilometers
I'm<00:01:36.960> sure<00:01:37.200> should<00:01:37.650> be<00:01:37.770> changed<00:01:38.329> you<00:01:39.329> know<00:01:39.479> half

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
I'm sure should be changed you know half

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.230 
I'm sure should be changed you know half
a<00:01:40.229> million<00:01:40.409> over<00:01:41.159> half<00:01:41.340> a<00:01:41.430> million<00:01:41.610> kilometers

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
a million over half a million kilometers

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.050 
a million over half a million kilometers
a<00:01:42.509> lot<00:01:43.170> I'll<00:01:43.320> use<00:01:43.560> these<00:01:44.220> things<00:01:44.399> are<00:01:44.549> reliable

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
a lot I'll use these things are reliable

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.109 
a lot I'll use these things are reliable
but<00:01:45.210> still<00:01:46.020> you<00:01:46.740> know<00:01:46.890> most<00:01:47.610> things<00:01:47.700> don't

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
but still you know most things don't

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:52.749 
but still you know most things don't
last<00:01:48.240> that<00:01:48.390> long<00:01:48.509> but<00:01:49.490> change<00:01:50.490> them<00:01:50.670> up<00:01:50.820> and

00:01:52.749 --> 00:01:52.759 
last that long but change them up and

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:57.330 
last that long but change them up and
specs<00:01:53.759> on<00:01:54.200> 4.43<00:01:55.200> you<00:01:55.649> of<00:01:55.829> an<00:01:55.950> inch

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:57.340 
specs on 4.43 you of an inch

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:01.109 
specs on 4.43 you of an inch
put<00:01:58.090> a<00:01:58.119> spark<00:01:58.390> plug<00:01:58.420> gap<00:01:59.729> when<00:02:00.729> you're<00:02:00.880> in<00:02:00.939> here

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:01.119 
put a spark plug gap when you're in here

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:04.919 
put a spark plug gap when you're in here
kind<00:02:01.810> of<00:02:01.899> giving<00:02:02.350> a<00:02:02.409> once-over<00:02:03.689> make<00:02:04.689> sure<00:02:04.840> you

00:02:04.919 --> 00:02:04.929 
kind of giving a once-over make sure you

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:08.369 
kind of giving a once-over make sure you
let<00:02:05.079> the<00:02:05.289> whole<00:02:05.409> is<00:02:05.590> everything<00:02:06.039> is<00:02:06.159> okay<00:02:07.379> yeah

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:08.379 
let the whole is everything is okay yeah

00:02:08.379 --> 00:02:12.589 
let the whole is everything is okay yeah
I'll<00:02:09.099> check<00:02:09.129> everything<00:02:10.140> yeah

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
I'll check everything yeah

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:17.070 
I'll check everything yeah
the<00:02:13.920> spark<00:02:14.920> plug<00:02:15.129> wires<00:02:15.660> I'm<00:02:16.660> not<00:02:16.810> sure<00:02:17.019> if

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
the spark plug wires I'm not sure if

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.940 
the spark plug wires I'm not sure if
these<00:02:17.200> original<00:02:17.709> they<00:02:18.549> look<00:02:18.730> nice<00:02:19.000> but<00:02:19.299> you

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
these original they look nice but you

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.140 
these original they look nice but you
still<00:02:20.950> want<00:02:21.340> to<00:02:21.400> make<00:02:21.580> sure<00:02:21.790> everything<00:02:22.060> is

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
still want to make sure everything is

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:26.070 
still want to make sure everything is
okay<00:02:22.450> oh<00:02:22.480> so<00:02:22.810> much<00:02:23.140> you<00:02:23.319> use<00:02:24.569> but<00:02:25.569> that's<00:02:25.690> it

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080 
okay oh so much you use but that's it

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.410 
okay oh so much you use but that's it
okay<00:02:26.769> just<00:02:27.250> reversed<00:02:27.549> after<00:02:27.910> you<00:02:28.180> change

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
okay just reversed after you change

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:29.809 
okay just reversed after you change
those<00:02:28.569> spark<00:02:28.870> plugs<00:02:28.900> reverse<00:02:29.470> everything

00:02:29.809 --> 00:02:29.819 
those spark plugs reverse everything

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:32.220 
those spark plugs reverse everything
clean<00:02:30.819> up<00:02:30.970> everything<00:02:31.299> it's<00:02:31.629> good<00:02:31.750> idea<00:02:31.840> when

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
clean up everything it's good idea when

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.050 
clean up everything it's good idea when
you're<00:02:32.349> in<00:02:32.440> here<00:02:32.620> to<00:02:32.739> vacuum<00:02:33.579> everything<00:02:33.700> out

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
you're in here to vacuum everything out

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.530 
you're in here to vacuum everything out
