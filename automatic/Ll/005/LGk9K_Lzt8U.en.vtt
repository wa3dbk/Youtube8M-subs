00:00:06.249 --> 00:00:10.010
 what sensations from this sparring 

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:11.030
 which is the last in the program 

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:13.790
 preparatory fees 

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:16.759
 Well, I will say of course he is not like us but 

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:18.919
 The most important thing I think is the game 

00:00:16.759 --> 00:00:21.529
 training place instead guided training 

00:00:18.919 --> 00:00:24.079
 ok guys moved that first tranche 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:26.599
 and neatly the most important thing in this collection 

00:00:24.079 --> 00:00:29.409
 was the last game nobody got 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:33.500
 injury before coming 

00:00:29.409 --> 00:00:36.620
 showed good results it was 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:38.750
 Copernicus noticed that we were you 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.550
 Of course we do not notice on a super important 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:43.250
 so we show our game so we 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:46.010
 better mind-level interaction 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:50.629
 resistance bukovka immediately as you are a little 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:52.160
 a little bit of them of course you can 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:54.339
 say somewhere a little disturbed probably 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:58.609
 so of course we are not capable of competing 

00:00:54.339 --> 00:01:02.059
 how the goal was formed naturally 

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:04.989
 or legal chance I think good 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:08.649
 running up and but honestly 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:10.540
 made a backache on which swelled 

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:14.830
 Feelings of team interaction 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:18.729
 Much organization turned out early days 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:22.390
 of course it was not so I think now 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:24.340
 and we also see that we get used to each other 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:26.920
 and something we have good moments 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:28.840
 It turns out first of all and on 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:31.060
 training we try and in games too 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.770
 do but i think first championship 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:34.780
 We will be much higher interaction 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:37.840
 it is true that any victory will come we 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:40.679
 even this is such not so much 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:43.119
 unexpected extremity hryvnia rgu rk 

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:44.950
 when a win is always good is it 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:47.229
 value plays or in training you 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:49.690
 play if you stopped in front of you 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:51.490
 set a goal in every match in every 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:53.590
 training every dender only 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:56.649
 will always win for sure 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:58.479
 and you grow more you add more 

00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:00.610
 further if you have only the spirit 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:03.640
 I consider the winners for a football player 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:06.220
 well and if you somehow still and 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:08.440
 in training you are our game then they are not 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:10.920
 I remember this, I got used to it only 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.920
 to win
