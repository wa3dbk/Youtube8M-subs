kind of cool it's all done on the
e-string<00:00:33.340> so<00:00:34.090> it's<00:00:34.239> an<00:00:34.330> easy<00:00:34.570> beginner<00:00:34.930> piece

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
e-string so it's an easy beginner piece

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.250 
e-string so it's an easy beginner piece
we're<00:00:37.210> going<00:00:37.360> to<00:00:37.420> be<00:00:37.570> picking<00:00:38.220> just<00:00:39.220> like<00:00:39.399> that

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:42.700 
then you need strings just like that

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:48.569 
then you need strings just like that
immediately<00:00:44.040> 1<00:00:45.040> &amp;<00:00:45.370> 2<00:00:45.460> &amp;<00:00:45.670> 3<00:00:45.940> &amp;<00:00:46.270> 4<00:00:46.510> &amp;<00:00:47.110> 1<00:00:47.170> &amp;<00:00:47.649> 2<00:00:47.800> &amp;<00:00:47.980> 3<00:00:48.340> &amp;

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:06.520 
hands in second position from and in

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:08.150 
hands in second position from and in
second<00:01:06.850> position<00:01:06.940> on<00:01:07.300> the<00:01:07.420> fret<00:01:07.600> board<00:01:07.630> and

00:01:15.529 --> 00:01:15.539 
the notes are e open e twice f-sharp

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:20.990 
the notes are e open e twice f-sharp
then<00:01:16.539> back<00:01:16.810> to<00:01:17.020> e<00:01:18.360> G

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
then back to e G

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.590 
then back to e G
back<00:01:22.000> to<00:01:22.150> E<00:01:22.650> and<00:01:23.650> then<00:01:23.680> an<00:01:23.979> a<00:01:24.210> at<00:01:25.210> the<00:01:25.390> fifth

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:25.600 
back to E and then an a at the fifth

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:29.399 
back to E and then an a at the fifth
fret<00:01:25.689> and<00:01:26.140> then<00:01:26.770> back<00:01:26.950> to<00:01:26.979> G<00:01:27.479> like<00:01:28.479> that<00:01:28.780> so

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:29.409 
fret and then back to G like that so

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:31.499 
fret and then back to G like that so
basically<00:01:29.590> you're<00:01:30.100> repeating<00:01:30.640> the<00:01:30.670> e<00:01:30.790> open<00:01:31.390> E

00:01:31.499 --> 00:01:31.509 
basically you're repeating the e open E

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:34.380 
basically you're repeating the e open E
string<00:01:31.540> and<00:01:32.110> you're<00:01:32.560> tapping<00:01:33.040> on<00:01:33.220> the<00:01:33.490> other

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:34.390 
string and you're tapping on the other

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:37.080 
string and you're tapping on the other
other<00:01:34.780> notes<00:01:35.200> okay<00:01:35.680> so<00:01:35.740> we've<00:01:36.100> got<00:01:36.130> second

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:37.090 
other notes okay so we've got second

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:42.480 
other notes okay so we've got second
fret<00:01:37.680> F<00:01:38.680> sharp<00:01:39.100> third<00:01:39.729> fret<00:01:40.259> G<00:01:41.259> and<00:01:41.530> fifth<00:01:42.250> fret

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:42.490 
fret F sharp third fret G and fifth fret

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:58.109 
fret F sharp third fret G and fifth fret
a<00:01:42.729> all<00:01:43.659> on<00:01:43.960> the<00:01:44.049> E<00:01:44.080> string<00:01:44.229> so<00:01:44.770> it's<00:01:45.070> e<00:01:57.060> F<00:01:58.060> sharp

00:01:58.109 --> 00:01:58.119 
a all on the E string so it's e F sharp

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:07.680 
a all on the E string so it's e F sharp
E<00:02:00.330> G<00:02:01.330> E<00:02:02.250> a<00:02:04.860> G<00:02:06.030> that's<00:02:07.030> all<00:02:07.270> it<00:02:07.420> is

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:07.690 
E G E a G that's all it is

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:10.139 
E G E a G that's all it is
now<00:02:08.019> sometimes<00:02:08.950> I'm<00:02:09.160> doing<00:02:09.399> a<00:02:09.489> little<00:02:09.640> bending

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:10.149 
now sometimes I'm doing a little bending

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:11.850 
now sometimes I'm doing a little bending
with<00:02:10.360> git<00:02:10.539> which<00:02:10.810> gives<00:02:11.110> it<00:02:11.260> a<00:02:11.319> little<00:02:11.470> flavor

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
with git which gives it a little flavor

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:16.710 
with git which gives it a little flavor
so<00:02:12.340> it<00:02:12.489> goes<00:02:12.670> like<00:02:12.880> this

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:26.480 

bending<00:02:17.500> on<00:02:17.620> your<00:02:17.770> g-string

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:26.490 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:28.620 

it<00:02:27.490> was<00:02:27.610> the<00:02:27.730> only<00:02:27.940> bending<00:02:28.300> is<00:02:28.420> on<00:02:28.540> the

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:28.630 
it was the only bending is on the

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:29.880 
it was the only bending is on the
g-string<00:02:28.870> and<00:02:29.140> that's<00:02:29.380> what<00:02:29.530> gives<00:02:29.740> it<00:02:29.860> that

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
g-string and that's what gives it that

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:31.410 
g-string and that's what gives it that
flavor<00:02:30.310> the<00:02:30.490> reason<00:02:30.790> why<00:02:30.910> it<00:02:30.970> gives<00:02:31.270> it<00:02:31.390> that

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
flavor the reason why it gives it that

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:37.590 
flavor the reason why it gives it that
cool<00:02:31.780> sound<00:02:32.050> is<00:02:32.350> G<00:02:33.450> is<00:02:34.450> your<00:02:34.510> minor<00:02:35.340> to<00:02:36.340> e<00:02:36.670> open

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:37.600 
cool sound is G is your minor to e open

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:42.150 
cool sound is G is your minor to e open
e<00:02:37.950> G<00:02:39.810> that<00:02:40.810> third<00:02:41.110> so<00:02:41.500> give<00:02:41.710> you<00:02:41.830> the<00:02:41.920> minor

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.160 
e G that third so give you the minor

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
e G that third so give you the minor
sound<00:02:44.490> if<00:02:45.490> that<00:02:45.730> rock<00:02:45.970> sound

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:56.220 

so<00:02:52.810> remember<00:02:53.590> that<00:02:53.620> relationship<00:02:54.310> e<00:02:54.489> G<00:02:55.450> minor

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230 
so remember that relationship e G minor

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:59.640 
so remember that relationship e G minor
okay<00:02:57.159> give<00:02:57.730> you<00:02:57.849> the<00:02:57.970> E<00:02:58.000> minor<00:02:58.450> okay<00:02:59.260> so<00:02:59.319> let's

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650 
okay give you the E minor okay so let's

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:12.260 
okay give you the E minor okay so let's
let's<00:03:00.099> play<00:03:00.280> that<00:03:00.370> one<00:03:00.700> more<00:03:00.849> time

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:12.270 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:14.850 

if<00:03:13.270> you<00:03:13.540> work<00:03:13.780> on<00:03:13.930> that<00:03:14.110> a<00:03:14.140> little<00:03:14.290> wild<00:03:14.710> with

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:14.860 
if you work on that a little wild with

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:16.950 
if you work on that a little wild with
your<00:03:15.160> gang<00:03:15.430> speed<00:03:15.820> just<00:03:16.060> take<00:03:16.240> your<00:03:16.420> time<00:03:16.630> go
