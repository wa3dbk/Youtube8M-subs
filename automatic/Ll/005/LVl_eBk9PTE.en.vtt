00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:06.430
If you have varicose eczema, please don’t
make this common but very serious mistake.

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:27.479
I am am going to tell you the truth about
varicose eczema. You see a lot of people – including

00:00:27.479 --> 00:00:33.770
many doctors believe that varicose eczema
is a dermatological condition, a skin condition

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:41.230
that should be treated by dermatologists or
with creams. Yes, it is associated with inflammation

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:47.241
and some doctors treat it with steroid creams.
However, this is just not acceptable and it

00:00:47.241 --> 00:00:53.830
is completely wrong. You see, the real underlying
cause of varicose eczema is not varicose veins

00:00:53.830 --> 00:01:00.020
or inflammation, it is actually a condition
called superficial vein reflux which causes

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:06.591
varicose eczema. And, it is the superficial
vein reflux that needs to be treated. Steroid

00:01:06.591 --> 00:01:12.670
creams just mask the problem. In fact, if
you use steroids for any significant length

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:18.810
of time, they can actually damage the skin,
making it thin and more vulnerable to damage.

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.729
So if you have varicose eczema and you are
being treated by steroid creams,

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:29.609
go and see your doctor and ask to see a vein
specialist. I have treated many people with

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:35.841
varicose eczema and if it is caught at an
early stage, it can be cured completely. Steroid

00:01:35.841 --> 00:01:42.080
creams just mask the problem. Sure steroid
creams will ease the itch and redness and

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:47.179
initially you might think your leg is getting
better but in the long run, steroid creams

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:53.149
only cause more trouble. Now if you are troubled
