turn<00:01:08.520> tight<00:01:08.880> on<00:01:09.060> it<00:01:09.320> so<00:01:10.320> we're<00:01:10.590> going<00:01:10.680> to<00:01:10.740> take

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
turn tight on it so we're going to take

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.440 
turn tight on it so we're going to take
this<00:01:11.070> out<00:01:11.250> for<00:01:11.310> riding<00:01:11.729> a<00:01:11.790> little<00:01:11.970> bit<00:01:12.119> and<00:01:12.270> see

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
this out for riding a little bit and see

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.230 
this out for riding a little bit and see
how<00:01:12.600> it<00:01:12.750> feels<00:01:13.049> but<00:01:13.380> I<00:01:13.439> suspect<00:01:13.920> that<00:01:14.119> that<00:01:15.119> we

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
how it feels but I suspect that that we

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.490 
how it feels but I suspect that that we
won't<00:01:15.390> be<00:01:15.479> able<00:01:15.570> to<00:01:15.689> weight<00:01:15.900> the<00:01:16.049> front<00:01:16.320> end

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
won't be able to weight the front end

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.649 
won't be able to weight the front end
enough<00:01:16.799> to<00:01:17.009> to<00:01:17.759> feel<00:01:17.970> comfortable<00:01:18.330> on<00:01:18.600> it

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
enough to to feel comfortable on it

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.330 
enough to to feel comfortable on it
probably<00:01:19.500> going<00:01:19.619> to<00:01:19.710> be<00:01:19.770> hard<00:01:19.920> keeping<00:01:20.280> the

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
probably going to be hard keeping the

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.969 
probably going to be hard keeping the
front<00:01:20.490> wheel<00:01:20.700> on<00:01:20.729> the<00:01:20.970> ground<00:01:21.770> anyway<00:01:22.770> let's

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.380 
better than the street triple and I

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:46.480 
better than the street triple and I
think<00:01:45.649> I'm<00:01:45.740> going<00:01:45.890> to<00:01:45.950> like<00:01:46.039> the<00:01:46.159> standard

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:48.609 
think I'm going to like the standard
version<00:01:46.549> this<00:01:46.970> better<00:01:47.240> I<00:01:47.479> don't<00:01:48.229> like<00:01:48.500> the
