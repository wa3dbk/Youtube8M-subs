00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:06.150
 Hi everyone in this video I want 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:09.900
 talk I want to explain a little 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:13.230
 trick that I use for free bitcoins of 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:16.490
 to be able to double or at least increase 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:19.080
 my winnings with this program 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:22.109
 obviously we start from the assumption that 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.090
 life is not mathematical but it is not 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.460
 mathematics the payout absolutely 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.490
 will come a trick that sincerely a 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:33.020
 gave me great satisfaction for 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:37.640
 what can be said of course is 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:41.190
 however it is exactly as I said before not 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:43.800
 it is not at all however not sure at 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:46.140
 a hundred percent, however, I repeat to me he gave 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.840
 good satisfactions as it is 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:52.199
 success in some cases which is why I have 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.520
 exaggerated, however, is that I lost everything 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.920
 then we start from the assumption that 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.289
 however we have seen free bitcoin 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.870
 already in our video is a program that 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:04.890
 allows us to earn bitcoins in 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:07.369
 totally simple and free way there 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.840
 It allows to overcome the bits with so 

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:11.340
 just completely simple and 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.810
 free 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.509
 with the game and 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:19.149
 it is automatic and happens when you 

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:23.500
 reaches this sum on our e 

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:25.390
 bitcoin wallet so we don't have to 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:28.539
 straining even this the only thing 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:30.009
 what we have to do is every hour 

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:32.590
 enter a captcha code 

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:34.270
 then there is a kind of roulette that in 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:36.250
 based on the result 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:38.740
 and these are the valid results there 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:42.820
 allows you to earn a certain number 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:45.600
 of bitcoins not a certain number of bits 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:47.500
 anyway, you need to count bitcoin multiples 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.560
 I stress that one does not become rich 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:53.740
 however as I said as always said with 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:57.819
 bitcoin is a speech that must be made 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:02:00.580
 look to the future and we go beautiful 

00:01:57.819 --> 00:02:04.090
 to see how the trick closed me 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:06.720
 I repeat it is not mathematically proven 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:09.729
 but he gave me good results 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:11.830
 even if in some cases or lost 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:14.110
 so I invite you to use this 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:16.450
 trick very sparingly 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:23.799
 then as you can see I now have 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:27.280
 this amount of bitcoin 0.0003 thousand bt 

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:31.959
 bitcoin is this and I gain that 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:34.900
 received and today because I arrived already 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:36.940
 the payout has paid me several times 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.650
 like every Monday they pay anyway 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:41.470
 I can guarantee this 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:44.230
 then once we go up here 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:47.139
 bitcoin multiples we can there is 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:50.799
 multiplied the bitcoin we can play 

00:02:47.139 --> 00:02:53.790
 slot machine and roulette type I ask 

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:59.270
 apologizes type roulette then tells us 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:03:01.170
 how much we want to bet the winnings 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:05.400
 multiplied by how much it should be 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:07.440
 then for 234 up to 100 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.840
 so I proceed in this way 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:12.350
 obviously the least point I can 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:15.810
 fit the idle then already 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:19.230
 preset one is here is put 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:21.510
 multiply my winnings for you 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:23.010
 however I can also advise you of 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:24.960
 I leave to live peacefully 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:28.380
 I do because for who it is anyway I am 

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:30.120
 greedy you give me the term then put the 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:34.500
 close because and started to bet then 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:39.000
 one and i bet low you see i lost 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:42.810
 then I do already double point 2 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:48.990
 I lost again not double net 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:51.720
 4 and I repeated doubling the arrival at 16 

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:53.790
 I said you see now let's start 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:56.310
 bets are a little higher look 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:59.220
 as how my balance decreases 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:01.500
 I double and I won 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:06.980
 as you can see I doubled it 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:11.010
 every time we have arrived wins 60 40 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:14.340
 0000 64 bit then as you can see the 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:16.770
 my balance has increased this is already a bit 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:20.210
 gambling because I won 

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:22.710
 per se you want instead left for two 

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:26.310
 odds of winning are higher than in 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:28.440
 how much increasing and then the winnings in 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:32.160
 this case because as you can see me 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:32.880
 I win by seeds a point is scored 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:38.100
 I apologize 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:42.030
 a high score compared to 6,833 or 

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:44.930
 however equal 6,838 evin things out 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:48.890
 a lower score than that 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:51.210
 1167 or in any case also 1167 instead 

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:53.270
 putting to win for two like 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:56.510
 you can see increases of great luxury 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:58.490
 the scissors therefore it is easier to win 

00:04:56.510 --> 00:05:00.920
 in fact we go immediately to see 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:03.440
 obviously can also decreases the wins 

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:05.720
 let's proceed so now I have won with 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:08.630
 the high start again 

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:09.830
 so I always point to the minimum point 

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:11.870
 bass 

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:14.390
 I won very well so I arranged 

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:17.060
 again on the high or willing revenge 

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:19.910
 on the top down I apologize 

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:23.660
 in this case I therefore lost one 

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:29.330
 turning 1.2 you see I have won and here 

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:33.320
 obviously it increases I start point 1 ho 

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:36.320
 very well won we go to the low point 1 

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:42.100
 I won let's go to the high point 1 ho 

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:46.250
 won the low won the point I lost 

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:48.710
 I won the double 2 point 

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:52.250
 as you can see, however, increases respect 

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:54.170
 to the winning when I had done the 

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:55.640
 win multiply my winnings 

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:59.210
 because obviously you could see 

00:05:55.640 --> 00:06:01.580
 which is much simpler in this case 

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:03.200
 wins however obviously also decreases 

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:05.120
 the gain 

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:08.580
 nothing this is the trick I closed 

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:11.009
 I repeat I invite you to use it with much 

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:12.810
 I have a lot of parsimony because I don't 

00:06:11.009 --> 00:06:16.229
 is mathematician asked why he can 

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:18.389
 happen to be absurd that maybe you 

00:06:16.229 --> 00:06:21.689
 bets on the top, however, be a hundred 

00:06:18.389 --> 00:06:24.150
 times of course always at the bottom then 

00:06:21.689 --> 00:06:26.520
 you risk losing everything 

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:28.590
 so when you realize that it is the 

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:30.569
 loss begins to become substantial 

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:32.699
 my advice is to 

00:06:30.569 --> 00:06:35.430
 starting over from one this is what 

00:06:32.699 --> 00:06:38.219
 I advise you personally repeat that 

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:41.159
 it happened to me I also won some good looks 

00:06:38.219 --> 00:06:44.250
 figures in quotation marks so to speak not 

00:06:41.159 --> 00:06:47.969
 is that we would miss, however, it is me 

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:48.449
 success that I also lost some good ones 

00:06:47.969 --> 00:06:50.819
 figures 

00:06:48.449 --> 00:06:52.979
 that's what my advice is if 

00:06:50.819 --> 00:06:55.229
 you want to take advantage of it do it as well 

00:06:52.979 --> 00:06:57.629
 otherwise it's still a pleasure 

00:06:55.229 --> 00:07:00.000
 maybe if you have any other advice 

00:06:57.629 --> 00:07:05.009
 some other tricks you use 

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:07.289
 it's nice to share it and of course if 

00:07:05.009 --> 00:07:09.509
 you are not yet registered for free bitcoin 

00:07:07.289 --> 00:07:12.150
 I invite you to do so via link you will find

 below under this video because

 obviously there is also a program that me 

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:21.449
 allows me and allows you to 

00:07:16.889 --> 00:07:25.080
 make money thanks to ideas that are well done 

00:07:21.449 --> 00:07:27.389
 50 percent of what they do 

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:29.669
 win in this section in the section 

00:07:27.389 --> 00:07:32.400
 free play which is not little 

00:07:29.669 --> 00:07:35.339
 I can guarantee you well with this vi 

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:38.300
 I greet a hug from Francesco to
