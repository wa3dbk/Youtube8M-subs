00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.720 
switched to a volume or mute switch
which<00:00:15.809> is<00:00:15.990> pretty<00:00:16.230> much<00:00:16.410> useless<00:00:16.680> on<00:00:17.190> an<00:00:17.340> ipad

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
which is pretty much useless on an ipad

in four point two point one and a lot of

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.400 
in four point two point one and a lot of
people<00:00:21.060> weren't<00:00:21.359> happy<00:00:21.689> with<00:00:21.750> that<00:00:21.840> so<00:00:21.990> this

know<00:00:40.320> that<00:00:40.469> it<00:00:40.590> works<00:00:40.829> so<00:00:41.610> i'll<00:00:42.450> go<00:00:42.629> ahead<00:00:42.660> and

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
know that it works so i'll go ahead and

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.330 
know that it works so i'll go ahead and
show<00:00:42.960> that<00:00:43.079> to<00:00:43.440> you<00:00:43.590> guys<00:00:43.770> right<00:00:44.010> now<00:00:44.070> and<00:00:44.219> that

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
it works as you can see there is a block

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.270 
it works as you can see there is a block
orientation<00:00:49.050> up<00:00:49.260> there<00:00:49.530> and<00:00:49.770> if<00:00:49.980> i<00:00:50.129> go<00:00:50.250> ahead

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
orientation up there and if i go ahead

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.200 
orientation up there and if i go ahead
and<00:00:50.489> flip<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:51.120> switch<00:00:51.360> right<00:00:51.570> here<00:00:52.879> it<00:00:53.879> goes

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
and flip the switch right here it goes

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.200 
and flip the switch right here it goes
right<00:00:54.449> there<00:00:54.809> it<00:00:54.930> goes<00:00:55.110> away<00:00:55.289> it's<00:00:56.280> on<00:00:56.460> now<00:00:56.910> top

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
right there it goes away it's on now top

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.639 
right there it goes away it's on now top
on<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:59.390> one<00:01:00.390> being<00:01:00.629> that<00:01:00.750> if<00:01:00.989> you<00:01:01.020> do<00:01:01.260> rotate

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
on the one being that if you do rotate

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.799 
on the one being that if you do rotate
your<00:01:01.770> device<00:01:01.800> little<00:01:02.309> switches<00:01:02.550> off<00:01:02.850> then<00:01:03.660> you

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
your device little switches off then you

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.780 
your device little switches off then you
go<00:01:03.960> ahead<00:01:04.110> and<00:01:04.290> flip<00:01:04.799> the<00:01:04.979> switch<00:01:05.189> again<00:01:05.519> it

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
go ahead and flip the switch again it

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.719 
go ahead and flip the switch again it
does<00:01:06.510> that<00:01:06.750> thing<00:01:06.960> where<00:01:07.200> it'll<00:01:07.830> rotate<00:01:08.250> back

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
does that thing where it'll rotate back

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.550 
does that thing where it'll rotate back
to<00:01:09.060> the<00:01:09.180> opposite<00:01:09.510> way<00:01:09.659> then<00:01:09.960> go<00:01:10.140> where<00:01:10.350> it<00:01:10.439> is

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
to the opposite way then go where it is

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.830 
to the opposite way then go where it is
then<00:01:11.250> as<00:01:11.400> you<00:01:11.549> can<00:01:11.700> see<00:01:11.939> it<00:01:12.090> stays<00:01:12.420> in<00:01:12.689> its

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
then as you can see it stays in its

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.249 
then as you can see it stays in its
locked<00:01:13.170> orientation<00:01:14.840> so<00:01:15.840> i'll<00:01:15.930> go<00:01:16.080> ahead<00:01:16.110> and

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
locked orientation so i'll go ahead and

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.140 
locked orientation so i'll go ahead and
show<00:01:16.439> you<00:01:16.650> that<00:01:16.680> bug<00:01:16.979> again<00:01:17.250> if<00:01:17.549> i<00:01:17.640> switch<00:01:17.970> it

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
show you that bug again if i switch it

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:19.730 
show you that bug again if i switch it
it<00:01:18.270> does<00:01:18.420> that<00:01:18.600> but<00:01:19.110> if<00:01:19.229> you're<00:01:19.380> already<00:01:19.560> in

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
it does that but if you're already in

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.410 
it does that but if you're already in
this<00:01:19.920> mode<00:01:20.130> unlock<00:01:20.549> it<00:01:20.759> then<00:01:20.909> lock<00:01:21.090> it<00:01:21.119> it

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
this mode unlock it then lock it it

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.359 
this mode unlock it then lock it it
stays<00:01:21.840> it's<00:01:22.500> a<00:01:22.560> little<00:01:22.799> confusing<00:01:22.950> to<00:01:23.280> explain

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
stays it's a little confusing to explain

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.609 
stays it's a little confusing to explain
but<00:01:24.090> you'll<00:01:24.330> kind<00:01:24.659> of<00:01:24.780> pick<00:01:24.930> up<00:01:24.960> on<00:01:25.259> it<00:01:25.290> once

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
but you'll kind of pick up on it once

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.460 
but you'll kind of pick up on it once
you<00:01:25.830> get<00:01:26.040> the<00:01:26.220> tweak<00:01:26.490> on<00:01:26.729> that<00:01:27.479> is<00:01:27.630> really<00:01:28.200> all

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
you get the tweak on that is really all

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.499 
you get the tweak on that is really all
there<00:01:28.680> is<00:01:28.710> to<00:01:29.009> the<00:01:29.130> tweak<00:01:29.400> you<00:01:29.670> can<00:01:29.850> still<00:01:30.180> use

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
there is to the tweak you can still use

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:34.100 
there is to the tweak you can still use
the<00:01:31.640> can<00:01:32.640> still<00:01:32.880> use<00:01:33.060> the<00:01:33.240> software<00:01:33.630> button<00:01:33.960> if

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
the can still use the software button if

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.929 
the can still use the software button if
you'd<00:01:34.229> like<00:01:34.380> and<00:01:34.680> it<00:01:35.009> automatically<00:01:35.610> changes

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
you'd like and it automatically changes

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.630 
you'd like and it automatically changes
when<00:01:36.299> you<00:01:36.420> flip<00:01:36.659> the<00:01:36.840> switch<00:01:37.140> as<00:01:38.100> you<00:01:38.280> can<00:01:38.430> see

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
when you flip the switch as you can see

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.179 
when you flip the switch as you can see
i'm<00:01:38.790> flipping<00:01:39.090> the<00:01:39.180> switch<00:01:39.420> up<00:01:39.630> here<00:01:39.990> so<00:01:40.829> it's

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
i'm flipping the switch up here so it's

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.460 
i'm flipping the switch up here so it's
compatible<00:01:41.520> with<00:01:41.729> that<00:01:41.909> works<00:01:42.270> great<00:01:42.720> like<00:01:43.320> i

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
compatible with that works great like i

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.429 
compatible with that works great like i
said<00:01:43.530> the<00:01:43.890> only<00:01:44.040> minor<00:01:44.369> bug<00:01:44.640> is<00:01:45.020> it<00:01:46.020> does<00:01:46.200> that

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
said the only minor bug is it does that

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:47.899 
said the only minor bug is it does that
thing<00:01:46.710> when<00:01:46.950> you're<00:01:47.070> rotating<00:01:47.250> your<00:01:47.670> advice

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
thing when you're rotating your advice

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.969 
thing when you're rotating your advice
be<00:01:48.420> the<00:01:48.600> right<00:01:48.780> go<00:01:48.960> ahead<00:01:48.990> and<00:01:49.380> check<00:01:49.740> that<00:01:49.920> out

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
be the right go ahead and check that out
