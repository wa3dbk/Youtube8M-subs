00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:15.550
 hello to all guys well found in 

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:17.740
 my channel I am blasi that the 68 and 

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:20.140
 welcome to this new video then 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:23.200
 obviously as usual to get started 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:25.750
 at the exit of the new dlc it is time to 

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:27.220
 present yourself some new gameplay on the 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:29.350
 series of dragon ball xenon towards 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:32.040
 obviously I chose the mission of the 

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:34.260
 parallel number 19 which said 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.120
 let's train, that is, it's called that 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.760
 because he liked me a little, I come to him 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:41.290
 enough I have to tell the truth why 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:44.350
 we must fight practically against 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:46.210
 5 warriors who will obviously be like 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:48.879
 you are seeing small right now 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:51.280
 then it should be there for six 

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:54.430
 years if I'm not wrong though if it's not 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:55.320
 the one that gave enough problems a 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:58.030
 bit to everyone 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.100
 no, maybe i'm not coming a little bit 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:03.280
 ok, however, it looks pretty enough 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:06.250
 as a mission as obviously moves 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:08.470
 superbici by two and would like to try a 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:11.950
 little the little one made my way 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:15.850
 he says goodbye holidays let's see some of that 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:16.960
 happens it's not bad I was expecting a 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:20.410
 little damage in two 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:23.830
 but in the meantime if you notice you immobilize me 

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:26.410
 enemy for some fraction of a second is 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:28.240
 a little yes 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:30.900
 no he didn't immobilize it this time 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:35.400
 we see that he had seemed to see that 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.400
 small course immobilized ever 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:43.500
 then then the next challengers are 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:45.330
 escaped and trunks should be though 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.490
 at the moment there is only that he obviously cites 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:50.700
 as you are noticing I am playing alone 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:53.040
 with my character because let's talk to each other 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:56.490
 already clear, however, a character 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:02:00.060
 strong enough always talking to 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:03.509
 level that is just like level is the 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:07.410
 my high level character of 85 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:09.660
 then anyway let's say that with a certain one 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:12.000
 I still manage to overcome the difficulties 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.830
 missions so I said the version me 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.989
 I do work directly like del 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:18.030
 I always do so here is me 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:20.150
 he immobilized her ok on Friday because she didn't 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:22.530
 I still took this ours 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:25.110
 let's continue making shiny mails that 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:29.640
 I can't even use it well then 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:32.280
 let's do the holiday radio again and 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:35.250
 we also do a couple of bright shots 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:37.860
 who left no I went to 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:39.329
 sign two instead I was about to say that 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:46.320
 they had failed 

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:48.690
 ok so it is the arrival of trans and splits 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:51.180
 and except one of my characters in 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:52.980
 absolute favorite of dragon ball 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:55.600
 maybe I never told you what they are 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:57.490
 good or bad though 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:00.340
 I can tell him that certainly among my own 

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:03.460
 favorite there are game trunks there is gohan 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:06.550
 absolutely because I have a certain 

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:08.260
 affection for him I do not know I am bound by 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:10.780
 baby more or less like this night 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:14.170
 johan meanwhile they are hurting me 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:16.180
 let me say a goodbye holiday ok 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:19.450
 we are certain to say that the king is in front of us 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:21.550
 don't reload yet but let's see if 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:23.980
 we can resist 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:25.780
 ok we have immobilized trunks we do 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:27.790
 of another holiday farewell and another 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:30.370
 bright shot that we succeed 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:32.530
 ok no not mobilized okay a 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:34.390
 relative okay let's load c because not 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:38.050
 I would like to see this mission fail 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:41.890
 because that would mean that I should 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:43.750
 redo the video even if it's okay to 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:45.250
 fine even if I lose the canon 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:46.660
 I make the video that leaves so 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:49.240
 how it does nothing 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:52.570
 my channel must be transparent there 

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:55.660
 must be transparency then in 

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:58.570
 how frank is the burning attack if 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:03.120
 I'm not wrong and we defeated him too 

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:03.120
 so see you in the next area 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:15.750
 ok so these are our two 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:19.650
 final opponents then we have here a 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:22.460
 boy obviously and goku I believe that there 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:26.250
 give the two a lot of problems east 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:29.280
 it is not there 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:32.580
 I guess I do n't know a bit more there for sure 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:34.320
 granting you data about trans pgl like 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:37.350
 you can see at the moment however not 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:39.390
 let's do a holiday goodbye to see if 

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:43.650
 there was that did that stimulate though 

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:46.470
 Tonight 's how lecce is strange because 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:49.260
 sometimes he does it sometimes speaking rome 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:53.970
 always the power of high damage 

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:56.550
 of quarry as a review so let's take 

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:58.200
 so let's say this video on the fly 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:00.330
 let's take a brief review of this 

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:03.140
 move as you can see for yourself 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:05.790
 in my opinion it is not worth so much 

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:09.830
 have it also because the only thing 

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:15.260
 positive is the fact however does not make me 

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:18.360
 I occupy little state from the book resumes 

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:20.340
 or that we have recovered 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:22.950
 I said as a positive thing perhaps the fact 

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:25.200
 that immobilizes or rather stuns a 

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:28.430
 little the opponent for a few seconds 

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:30.850
 but I think so 

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:34.700
 the game is not worth the candle ie 

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:37.790
 I think it's better to try a move 

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:41.030
 ie have your most sporting like 

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:43.790
 see, however, it's a little bit difficult 

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:46.570
 to catch the opponent then it is not that 

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:48.470
 then going very high 

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:50.750
 meanwhile we have also concluded the 

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:52.700
 mission so guys I hope that 

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:57.100
 this video you enjoyed and how it has 

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:57.100
 only two see you at the next video
