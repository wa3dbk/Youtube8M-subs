00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:47.639 
so we even when we show a figure a
movement<00:01:45.609> is<00:01:46.090> not<00:01:46.299> to<00:01:46.509> grab<00:01:46.750> the<00:01:46.780> concept<00:01:47.469> to

00:01:47.639 --> 00:01:47.649 
movement is not to grab the concept to

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:54.200 
movement is not to grab the concept to
understand<00:01:48.100> sensitive<00:01:48.789> to<00:01:49.240> slowly<00:01:49.509> start
