to be talking about the rave and it has

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.290 
to be talking about the rave and it has
a<00:00:58.020> legendary<00:00:58.440> combat<00:00:58.980> rifle<00:00:59.190> and<00:00:59.579> the<00:01:00.000> prefix

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
a legendary combat rifle and the prefix

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.979 
a legendary combat rifle and the prefix
for<00:01:00.420> mine<00:01:00.660> is<00:01:00.899> a<00:01:00.930> CR<00:01:01.379> 28<00:01:01.829> scoped<00:01:02.460> Raven<00:01:02.940> and<00:01:03.210> the

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
for mine is a CR 28 scoped Raven and the

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.620 
for mine is a CR 28 scoped Raven and the
prefix<00:01:04.320> for<00:01:04.439> you<00:01:04.650> guys<00:01:04.799> might<00:01:05.189> change<00:01:05.460> so<00:01:05.850> as

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
prefix for you guys might change so as

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.149 
prefix for you guys might change so as
you<00:01:06.810> can<00:01:06.869> see<00:01:06.930> there<00:01:07.229> in<00:01:07.320> the<00:01:07.350> red<00:01:07.560> text<00:01:07.830> it

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
you can see there in the red text it

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.429 
you can see there in the red text it
says<00:01:08.369> two<00:01:09.000> more<00:01:09.299> bullets<00:01:09.720> and<00:01:09.930> make<00:01:10.020> all<00:01:10.229> the

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
says two more bullets and make all the

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.880 
says two more bullets and make all the
difference<00:01:11.689> so<00:01:12.689> I<00:01:13.020> think<00:01:13.080> that's<00:01:13.439> what<00:01:13.619> what

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
difference so I think that's what what

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.840 
difference so I think that's what what
it<00:01:14.010> means<00:01:14.220> is<00:01:14.430> it<00:01:14.610> means<00:01:14.820> it<00:01:15.750> shoots<00:01:16.520> two<00:01:17.520> more

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
it means is it means it shoots two more

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.109 
it means is it means it shoots two more
bullets<00:01:18.299> like<00:01:18.570> each<00:01:19.020> time<00:01:19.049> you<00:01:19.500> shoot<00:01:20.119> because

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
bullets like each time you shoot because

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.789 
bullets like each time you shoot because
it's<00:01:21.330> a<00:01:21.420> you<00:01:21.509> know<00:01:21.570> burst<00:01:21.930> it's<00:01:22.560> a<00:01:22.619> burst

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
it's a you know burst it's a burst

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:29.270 
here I'm going to do a comparison of a

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:33.640 
here I'm going to do a comparison of a
normal<00:02:29.600> combat<00:02:30.590> rifle<00:02:30.770> and<00:02:31.070> Raven<00:02:32.380> so<00:02:33.380> see<00:02:33.530> how

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
fast that shoots and look how long the

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:38.440 
fast that shoots and look how long the
society<00:02:36.020> look<00:02:36.470> at<00:02:36.560> that<00:02:36.650> long<00:02:36.980> right<00:02:37.270> at<00:02:38.270> least

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
society look at that long right at least
