00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.389 

well<00:00:00.630> of<00:00:00.719> course<00:00:00.810> the<00:00:01.140> first<00:00:01.380> time<00:00:02.010> signature

00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:02.399 
well of course the first time signature

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:08.030 
well of course the first time signature
is<00:00:03.560> 4/4<00:00:04.560> time<00:00:04.589> and<00:00:06.140> from<00:00:07.140> there<00:00:07.410> you<00:00:07.680> can<00:00:07.830> break

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040 
is 4/4 time and from there you can break

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:09.830 
is 4/4 time and from there you can break
that<00:00:08.250> down<00:00:08.309> into<00:00:08.910> different<00:00:09.179> things<00:00:09.420> you<00:00:09.719> can

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
that down into different things you can

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.600 
that down into different things you can
break<00:00:10.050> it<00:00:10.200> down<00:00:10.230> into<00:00:10.590> six<00:00:11.040> beats

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
break it down into six beats

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.299 
break it down into six beats
which<00:00:11.759> which<00:00:12.269> can<00:00:12.660> be<00:00:12.929> you<00:00:13.769> can<00:00:13.799> think<00:00:14.130> of<00:00:14.219> that

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
which which can be you can think of that

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.200 
which which can be you can think of that
as<00:00:14.370> six<00:00:14.700> four<00:00:15.000> because<00:00:15.690> you<00:00:15.809> could<00:00:15.960> just<00:00:16.139> take

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:17.210 
as six four because you could just take

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:20.210 
as six four because you could just take
quarter<00:00:18.210> note<00:00:18.330> triplets<00:00:18.779> to<00:00:19.740> settings<00:00:20.100> of

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
quarter note triplets to settings of

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.400 
quarter note triplets to settings of
those<00:00:20.340> which<00:00:20.550> it<00:00:20.670> would<00:00:20.789> sound<00:00:20.970> like<00:00:21.320> you<00:00:22.320> got

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
those which it would sound like you got

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.480 
those which it would sound like you got
a<00:00:22.470> quarter<00:00:22.769> note<00:00:22.890> here<00:00:23.539> like<00:00:24.539> this<00:00:25.400> support<00:00:26.400> or

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
a quarter note here like this support or

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.359 
a quarter note here like this support or
note<00:00:26.609> and<00:00:27.390> when<00:00:27.900> you<00:00:27.990> do<00:00:28.260> Polly<00:00:28.650> rhythms<00:00:29.099> like

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
note and when you do Polly rhythms like

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:38.090 
note and when you do Polly rhythms like
this<00:00:29.580> this<00:00:30.150> is<00:00:30.330> six<00:00:30.750> over<00:00:31.019> four<00:00:36.770> so<00:00:37.770> a<00:00:37.800> lot<00:00:38.070> of

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
this this is six over four so a lot of

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:52.330 
this this is six over four so a lot of
times<00:00:38.370> when<00:00:38.520> I'm<00:00:38.610> playing<00:00:38.850> I<00:00:39.120> can<00:00:39.300> think<00:00:39.480> like

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:52.340 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:54.890 

so<00:00:53.340> that's<00:00:53.520> just<00:00:53.640> one<00:00:53.940> way<00:00:53.970> of<00:00:54.329> approaching<00:00:54.420> it

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:54.900 
so that's just one way of approaching it

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:56.540 
so that's just one way of approaching it
that<00:00:55.320> that's<00:00:55.680> one<00:00:55.920> way<00:00:56.040> and<00:00:56.220> then<00:00:56.280> you<00:00:56.400> have

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
that that's one way and then you have

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.490 
that that's one way and then you have
just<00:00:56.670> your<00:00:56.850> basic<00:00:57.059> you<00:00:57.840> can<00:00:57.930> go<00:00:58.080> two<00:00:58.200> three

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
just your basic you can go two three

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:05.000 
just your basic you can go two three
four<00:00:58.800> from<00:00:58.980> there<00:00:59.190> which<00:00:59.370> is<00:01:03.110> one<00:01:04.110> two<00:01:04.530> three

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
four from there which is one two three

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.609 
four from there which is one two three
one<00:01:05.430> two<00:01:05.790> three<00:01:06.210> and<00:01:06.660> then<00:01:07.020> you<00:01:07.110> can<00:01:07.259> apply<00:01:07.560> for

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
one two three and then you can apply for

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.760 
one two three and then you can apply for
over<00:01:08.310> that<00:01:08.490> which<00:01:08.759> would<00:01:08.880> be<00:01:09.030> like<00:01:09.210> one<00:01:09.450> two

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:09.770 
over that which would be like one two

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:20.029 
over that which would be like one two
one<00:01:10.770> two<00:01:17.869> so<00:01:18.869> that's<00:01:19.050> what<00:01:19.350> they<00:01:19.440> call<00:01:19.619> these

00:01:20.029 --> 00:01:20.039 
one two so that's what they call these

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:22.400 
one two so that's what they call these
these<00:01:20.430> things<00:01:20.700> are<00:01:20.850> those<00:01:21.600> are<00:01:21.780> poly<00:01:22.020> rhythms

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:22.410 
these things are those are poly rhythms

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:25.070 
these things are those are poly rhythms
because<00:01:23.250> I'm<00:01:23.550> playing<00:01:23.759> another<00:01:24.390> time

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
because I'm playing another time

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.930 
because I'm playing another time
signature<00:01:25.590> over<00:01:25.920> another<00:01:26.190> time<00:01:26.310> signature

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:26.940 
signature over another time signature

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:28.430 
signature over another time signature
could<00:01:27.270> play<00:01:27.390> three<00:01:27.630> against<00:01:27.930> four<00:01:27.960> you<00:01:28.320> can

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:28.440 
could play three against four you can

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:32.029 
could play three against four you can
play<00:01:28.590> four<00:01:28.920> against<00:01:29.190> six<00:01:29.520> and<00:01:30.800> then<00:01:31.800> you<00:01:31.890> got

00:01:32.029 --> 00:01:32.039 
play four against six and then you got

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:34.639 
play four against six and then you got
like<00:01:32.220> five<00:01:32.460> four<00:01:32.910> all<00:01:33.780> right<00:01:33.840> five<00:01:34.229> four<00:01:34.259> which

00:01:34.639 --> 00:01:34.649 
like five four all right five four which

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:36.680 
like five four all right five four which
is<00:01:34.800> like<00:01:35.009> you've<00:01:35.430> heard<00:01:35.670> Dave<00:01:36.149> Brubeck's<00:01:36.600> take

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:36.690 
is like you've heard Dave Brubeck's take

the fact that on TV now they're on a
commercial<00:02:18.239> you<00:02:18.750> hear<00:02:19.140> this<00:02:19.530> sound

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.220 

which<00:02:26.280> is<00:02:26.490> the<00:02:26.670> rhythm<00:02:27.000> that<00:02:27.180> they<00:02:27.810> drew<00:02:28.080> back

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
which is the rhythm that they drew back

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.680 
which is the rhythm that they drew back
in<00:02:28.290> and<00:02:28.950> Steve<00:02:29.850> was<00:02:30.000> just<00:02:30.180> talking<00:02:30.450> about<00:02:30.510> the

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
in and Steve was just talking about the

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.690 
in and Steve was just talking about the
rhythm<00:02:30.900> that<00:02:30.990> Dave<00:02:31.140> Brubeck<00:02:31.500> uses<00:02:31.890> in<00:02:32.100> Paul

Desmond's<00:02:33.180> take<00:02:33.390> five<00:02:33.890> and<00:02:34.890> that's<00:02:35.610> it's<00:02:35.970> so

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
Desmond's take five and that's it's so

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:37.940 
Desmond's take five and that's it's so
easy<00:02:36.390> to<00:02:36.570> hear<00:02:36.990> even<00:02:37.320> the<00:02:37.500> you<00:02:37.620> know<00:02:37.710> it's<00:02:37.800> one

two three four five but people can count

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.110 
two three four five but people can count
that<00:02:39.510> they<00:02:39.720> feel<00:02:39.930> it
