career<00:02:08.080> he<00:02:08.920> came<00:02:09.190> up<00:02:09.399> largest<00:02:10.060> I<00:02:10.500> think<00:02:11.500> for

00:02:11.699 --> 00:02:11.709 
career he came up largest I think for

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:14.400 
career he came up largest I think for
Oakland<00:02:12.160> on<00:02:13.060> first<00:02:13.510> down<00:02:13.810> he's<00:02:14.019> of<00:02:14.170> San

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.410 
Oakland on first down he's of San

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:16.559 
Oakland on first down he's of San
linebackers<00:02:15.100> just<00:02:15.310> like<00:02:15.519> Bob<00:02:15.760> Miller<00:02:16.060> they

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:16.569 
linebackers just like Bob Miller they

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:18.750 
linebackers just like Bob Miller they
get<00:02:16.720> in<00:02:16.840> the<00:02:16.959> sub<00:02:17.200> package<00:02:17.739> he<00:02:18.160> comes<00:02:18.459> off<00:02:18.730> the

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
get in the sub package he comes off the

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.750 
get in the sub package he comes off the
edge<00:02:18.940> he<00:02:19.840> plays<00:02:20.140> in<00:02:20.350> fin<00:02:20.500> tensity<00:02:21.040> he<00:02:21.519> plays

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
edge he plays in fin tensity he plays

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.880 
edge he plays in fin tensity he plays
with<00:02:22.000> energy<00:02:22.600> and<00:02:22.989> I<00:02:23.200> think<00:02:23.470> he's<00:02:23.590> going<00:02:23.709> to<00:02:23.799> be

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
with energy and I think he's going to be

with energy and I think he's going to be
