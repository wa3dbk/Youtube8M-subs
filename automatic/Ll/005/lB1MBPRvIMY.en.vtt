stock<00:05:18.570> finish<00:05:19.530> this<00:05:19.919> is<00:05:20.040> my<00:05:20.130> first<00:05:20.400> ever

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:20.580 
stock finish this is my first ever

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:22.100 
stock finish this is my first ever
Kickstarter<00:05:21.120> project<00:05:21.540> and<00:05:21.660> the<00:05:21.750> first<00:05:21.930> time

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:22.110 
Kickstarter project and the first time

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:24.250 
Kickstarter project and the first time
I've<00:05:22.229> ever<00:05:22.260> designed<00:05:22.860> a<00:05:23.190> deck<00:05:23.370> of<00:05:23.400> cards<00:05:23.520> and

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:24.260 
I've ever designed a deck of cards and

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:26.750 
I've ever designed a deck of cards and
this<00:05:25.260> is<00:05:25.440> just<00:05:25.650> a<00:05:25.740> mock<00:05:25.949> deck<00:05:26.220> so<00:05:26.490> the<00:05:26.580> deck

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:26.760 
this is just a mock deck so the deck

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:28.490 
this is just a mock deck so the deck
spaces<00:05:27.389> won't<00:05:27.570> be<00:05:27.780> like<00:05:27.990> this<00:05:28.169> it's<00:05:28.380> actually

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:28.500 
spaces won't be like this it's actually

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:30.920 
spaces won't be like this it's actually
going<00:05:28.770> to<00:05:28.830> be<00:05:28.949> completely<00:05:29.400> custom<00:05:29.970> made<00:05:30.180> if<00:05:30.750> we

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:30.930 
going to be completely custom made if we

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:33.529 
going to be completely custom made if we
can<00:05:31.110> reach<00:05:31.410> certain<00:05:31.889> reach<00:05:32.460> goals<00:05:32.789> so<00:05:33.510> I

00:05:33.529 --> 00:05:33.539 
can reach certain reach goals so I

00:05:33.539 --> 00:05:37.279 
can reach certain reach goals so I
custom<00:05:34.350> made<00:05:34.530> with<00:05:34.860> custom-made<00:05:35.490> suits<00:05:36.289> every

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:45.630 
paper stock could be soapbox so will

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:47.210 
paper stock could be soapbox so will
feel<00:05:45.870> like<00:05:46.020> the<00:05:46.139> red<00:05:46.320> monarch<00:05:46.740> deck<00:05:46.949> if<00:05:47.100> you

get fund it in the future and I will
probably<00:05:56.880> include<00:05:57.539> that<00:05:57.930> design<00:05:58.410> as<00:05:59.120> one<00:06:00.120> of

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:00.150 
probably include that design as one of

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:04.129 
probably include that design as one of
