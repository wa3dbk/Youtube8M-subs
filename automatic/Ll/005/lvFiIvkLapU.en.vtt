take<00:00:46.680> the<00:00:46.890> more<00:00:47.190> difficult<00:00:47.489> space<00:00:48.120> that's

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
take the more difficult space that's

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.360 
take the more difficult space that's
just<00:00:48.510> stupid<00:00:49.110> and<00:00:49.260> I<00:00:49.379> don't<00:00:49.440> know<00:00:49.649> why<00:00:49.829> guys<00:00:50.039> do

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
gonna do another one as well when you

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.030 
gonna do another one as well when you
drive<00:01:35.220> in<00:01:35.520> and<00:01:35.820> curves<00:01:36.329> guys<00:01:37.020> you<00:01:37.290> gotta<00:01:37.680> slow

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
drive in and curves guys you gotta slow

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.310 
drive in and curves guys you gotta slow
down<00:01:38.070> I<00:01:38.400> see<00:01:38.579> guys<00:01:38.729> speeding<00:01:39.270> up<00:01:39.329> 70<00:01:39.869> miles<00:01:40.110> an

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
down I see guys speeding up 70 miles an

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.410 
down I see guys speeding up 70 miles an
hour<00:01:40.439> in<00:01:40.590> curves<00:01:40.979> I<00:01:41.369> don't<00:01:42.030> care<00:01:42.210> what<00:01:42.329> the

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
hour in curves I don't care what the

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.800 
hour in curves I don't care what the
speed<00:01:42.689> limit<00:01:43.020> says<00:01:43.049> that<00:01:44.009> is<00:01:44.340> for<00:01:44.640> cars<00:01:44.880> okay

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
speed limit says that is for cars okay

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.780 
speed limit says that is for cars okay
and<00:01:46.350> the<00:01:46.470> other<00:01:46.500> part<00:01:46.920> is<00:01:47.009> just<00:01:47.250> because<00:01:47.490> when

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
and the other part is just because when

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:48.770 
and the other part is just because when
you're<00:01:47.880> driving<00:01:48.090> down<00:01:48.329> the<00:01:48.390> road<00:01:48.479> which

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
you're driving down the road which

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:49.910 
you're driving down the road which
you'll<00:01:48.930> learn<00:01:48.960> when<00:01:49.229> you<00:01:49.320> become<00:01:49.590> a<00:01:49.619> truck

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
you'll learn when you become a truck

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.270 
you'll learn when you become a truck
driver<00:01:50.220> is<00:01:50.780> that<00:01:51.780> all<00:01:51.990> roads<00:01:52.380> are<00:01:52.680> not<00:01:52.829> leveled

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
driver is that all roads are not leveled

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.990 
driver is that all roads are not leveled
correctly<00:01:53.909> so<00:01:54.869> when<00:01:55.680> a<00:01:55.710> car<00:01:55.979> is<00:01:56.310> off<00:01:56.610> level

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
correctly so when a car is off level

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.539 
correctly so when a car is off level
it's<00:01:57.420> very<00:01:57.509> easy<00:01:57.869> to<00:01:58.020> slow<00:01:58.290> down<00:01:58.530> when<00:01:59.340> you're

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
it's very easy to slow down when you're

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.120 
it's very easy to slow down when you're
off<00:01:59.759> level<00:02:00.119> you<00:02:00.960> have<00:02:01.140> to<00:02:01.170> you<00:02:01.619> want<00:02:01.740> to<00:02:01.860> let<00:02:02.040> up

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
off level you have to you want to let up

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.840 
off level you have to you want to let up
off<00:02:02.250> the<00:02:02.430> gas<00:02:02.579> not<00:02:02.880> hit<00:02:03.060> the<00:02:03.180> brakes<00:02:03.479> but<00:02:04.229> also

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:04.850 
off the gas not hit the brakes but also

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:07.340 
off the gas not hit the brakes but also
you<00:02:05.850> gotta<00:02:06.030> remember<00:02:06.240> your<00:02:06.509> load<00:02:06.719> might<00:02:07.020> shift

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
you gotta remember your load might shift

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.469 
you gotta remember your load might shift
on<00:02:07.680> you<00:02:07.890> and<00:02:08.580> that<00:02:08.700> can<00:02:08.849> cause<00:02:09.030> you<00:02:09.209> to<00:02:09.239> flip

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
on you and that can cause you to flip

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:10.520 
on you and that can cause you to flip
over

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
over

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.790 
over
so<00:02:10.950> you<00:02:11.009> go<00:02:11.250> slow<00:02:11.640> and<00:02:11.940> curves<00:02:12.410> and<00:02:13.410> you<00:02:13.560> you

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
so you go slow and curves and you you

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.440 
so you go slow and curves and you you
know<00:02:13.950> you<00:02:14.010> take<00:02:14.400> your<00:02:14.460> foot<00:02:14.730> off<00:02:14.880> the<00:02:14.910> gas<00:02:15.150> you

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
know you take your foot off the gas you

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:16.760 
know you take your foot off the gas you
want<00:02:15.630> to<00:02:15.690> use<00:02:15.810> you're<00:02:15.960> taking<00:02:16.380> your<00:02:16.500> foot<00:02:16.620> off

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
want to use you're taking your foot off

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.160 
want to use you're taking your foot off
the<00:02:16.800> gas<00:02:16.950> more<00:02:17.520> that<00:02:18.150> you<00:02:18.270> do<00:02:18.420> a<00:02:18.450> brake<00:02:18.840> to<00:02:19.020> slow

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
the gas more that you do a brake to slow

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:20.510 
the gas more that you do a brake to slow
down<00:02:19.440> because<00:02:19.650> when<00:02:19.890> you<00:02:19.950> hit<00:02:20.130> the<00:02:20.250> brakes

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
down because when you hit the brakes

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.150 
down because when you hit the brakes
that's<00:02:21.420> stopping<00:02:21.960> your<00:02:22.080> momentum<00:02:22.440> and<00:02:22.920> it<00:02:23.040> can

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
that's stopping your momentum and it can

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.520 
that's stopping your momentum and it can
cause<00:02:23.370> you<00:02:23.400> to<00:02:23.580> skid<00:02:24.030> or<00:02:24.360> slide<00:02:24.720> or<00:02:25.080> cause<00:02:25.320> the

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
cause you to skid or slide or cause the

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.470 
cause you to skid or slide or cause the
load<00:02:25.650> to<00:02:25.860> shift<00:02:26.100> if<00:02:26.730> you<00:02:26.790> take<00:02:27.090> your<00:02:27.209> foot<00:02:27.330> off

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
load to shift if you take your foot off

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.390 
load to shift if you take your foot off
the<00:02:27.510> gas<00:02:27.630> the<00:02:28.050> vehicle<00:02:28.500> this<00:02:28.590> is<00:02:28.650> a<00:02:28.740> semi-truck

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
the gas the vehicle this is a semi-truck

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.070 
the gas the vehicle this is a semi-truck
takes<00:02:29.670> a<00:02:29.760> lot<00:02:29.880> of<00:02:29.970> power<00:02:30.150> to<00:02:30.300> push<00:02:30.570> it<00:02:30.720> so<00:02:30.870> once

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
takes a lot of power to push it so once

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:32.540 
takes a lot of power to push it so once
it<00:02:31.230> loses<00:02:31.380> that<00:02:31.590> power<00:02:31.950> it<00:02:32.100> starts<00:02:32.370> to<00:02:32.430> slow

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
it loses that power it starts to slow

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:35.840 
it loses that power it starts to slow
down<00:02:32.700> real<00:02:33.030> quick<00:02:33.300> and<00:02:33.740> you<00:02:34.740> just<00:02:34.950> let<00:02:35.130> it<00:02:35.160> easy
