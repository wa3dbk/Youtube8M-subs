00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:11.940
 download and install chambers to your 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.799
 minecraft the first thing to do 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:17.070
 is to copy the link that I leave the 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:19.230
 description of the right stick copy and 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.869
 then you go to the internet and we have it 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.949
 up here is worth in the logo they select 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.949
 all illuminating 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:31.699
 and I'm going to talk about this page here 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:33.680
 what can we download are good 7 searched 

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:35.420
 and he had the forest or the and now he has 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:37.449
 came out the good ones that I was already 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:42.559
 the 1.8 point one that I have forgotten 

00:00:37.449 --> 00:00:46.430
 say to download version 1.8 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:49.780
 point one just to give this link 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:53.110
 here and give you a click 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:56.140
 well here they give you to download 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:58.630
 Once that's going to let you work 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:02.530
 this poster and we will give to download 

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:04.960
 that nothing happens then you have to 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:09.540
 trace it to the desktop ok we're going to 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:14.260
 show all the downloads and the shaders 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:17.860
 drag it to the desk once 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:21.360
 well had the writer jackie accomplished 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:26.530
 a double click and well I said that 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:30.909
 basically I already have this one 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:33.580
 to accept version 1.8 full already 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:37.930
 you have good but the replaced but not 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:40.500
 nothing happens because they left then 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:43.530
 you are going to go to your minecraft 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:49.680
 such that it's worth it there's not much to say 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:52.260
 and here where he puts profile and 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:55.290
 if why not better said if it does not come out 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:57.840
 down here directly and I would have to 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:01.470
 to come out of theater face you look for 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:05.460
 this then the six properties and apple 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:09.149
 I cut or this poster will come out and you 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:12.450
 put on your world again the 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:15.570
 world there with nothing just built 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:19.620
 Lama was flat and good to put 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:23.250
 that knowledge of tingo book as it shines 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:26.570
 this part of here is black and has no 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:29.640
 hand is worth the most appropriate is a block 

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:32.930
 beige nothing more 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:38.160
 this goes a little the created good 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:40.350
 and I left, forgive me 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.550
 I'm sorry before the eye let's go to 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:45.090
 options 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:50.180
 Seidor and here now three kids who have 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:54.750
 removed this good flashlight that is only 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:59.760
 nothing for the traders penalty and here 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:03:04.050
 there are already two charters the thousand mister for 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:07.950
 low for another flight in order that has a 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:09.850
 clone is not going so bad and good is quite 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:13.330
 well we have the water 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:16.140
 but it has good shadows and what 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:20.110
 I do not like what it is because it just 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:23.470
 because it will look cloudy when you see 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:26.050
 away there are times that you will be seen cloudy and 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:28.150
 good mariana 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:32.260
 when a long time ago Maria and the other 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:34.420
 is the cold vibrant place and this is very 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:36.220
 nice what happens that neither 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:38.860
 guided but it is very beautiful and has 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:41.860
 many and others but it seems great 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:44.260
 what water moves there look at f1 what 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:46.810
 nice mother of mine and when I meter under 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:49.810
 water is increasing the clouds are very cool 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:53.170
 another very nice thing that I liked 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:56.260
 it is very nice to look at the bad reflection that 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:04:00.520
 there is still this search and 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:03.819
 that has no more hands and then to me 

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:06.450
 I honestly do not like that I would like 

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:08.860
 that will remain at hand do not look in 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:11.440
 options of those things to see if your 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:17.560
 doll has a problem now no it is not 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:20.079
 that's worth look, we're going to see that 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:23.950
 as you see it's not the supposedly hand 

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:28.900
 yes good if you look how beautiful today reflects 

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:30.910
 more on the ground you see what there is and here 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:33.280
 the lava illuminated very well and all that kind 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:35.830
 of things and nothing else I hope that I have 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:37.510
 liked like and subscribe help
