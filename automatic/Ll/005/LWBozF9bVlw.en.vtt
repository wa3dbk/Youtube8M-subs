00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
modifications at least I think on the

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:51.690 
modifications at least I think on the
weapon<00:02:49.120> so<00:02:49.540> I<00:02:49.750> would<00:02:49.930> imagine<00:02:50.050> perhaps<00:02:51.010> we

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 
weapon so I would imagine perhaps we

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:53.630 
weapon so I would imagine perhaps we
will<00:02:51.820> be<00:02:51.970> able<00:02:52.060> to<00:02:52.210> craft<00:02:52.540> weapons<00:02:52.870> and

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.760 
will be able to craft weapons and
attachments<00:02:54.640> to<00:02:54.880> those<00:02:55.120> weapons<00:02:55.420> in<00:02:56.260> fallout

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:56.770

4<00:02:56.800> I<00:02:57.010> really<00:02:57.460> do<00:02:57.580> think<00:02:57.760> that<00:02:57.850> they<00:02:58.030> are<00:02:58.150> going

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:33.330 
merge aspects of Skyrim but hopefully
they<00:05:31.210> you<00:05:31.840> know<00:05:31.960> keep<00:05:32.260> it<00:05:32.410> more<00:05:32.620> like<00:05:32.890> the<00:05:33.100> fish

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:33.340 
they you know keep it more like the fish

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:35.430 
they you know keep it more like the fish
will<00:05:33.550> fall<00:05:33.730> out<00:05:33.910> 3<00:05:34.060> this<00:05:34.480> time<00:05:34.720> around<00:05:34.870> that's

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:35.440 
will fall out 3 this time around that's

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:36.870 
will fall out 3 this time around that's
something<00:05:35.680> that<00:05:35.800> I<00:05:35.890> would<00:05:36.130> like<00:05:36.250> and<00:05:36.610> it<00:05:36.700> also

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:36.880 
something that I would like and it also

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:39.330 
something that I would like and it also
would<00:05:37.270> separate<00:05:37.690> itself<00:05:37.990> from<00:05:38.110> Skyrim<00:05:38.890> which

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:39.340 
would separate itself from Skyrim which

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:41.190 
would separate itself from Skyrim which
would<00:05:39.550> be<00:05:39.640> really<00:05:39.850> nice<00:05:40.060> as<00:05:40.360> long<00:05:40.780> as<00:05:40.810> you<00:05:41.080> can

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:41.200 
would be really nice as long as you can

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:42.840 
would be really nice as long as you can
respect<00:05:41.650> your<00:05:41.800> character<00:05:42.220> of<00:05:42.280> course<00:05:42.520> because

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:42.850 
respect your character of course because

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:44.790 
respect your character of course because
that<00:05:43.060> would<00:05:43.300> be<00:05:43.420> important<00:05:43.930> considering<00:05:44.560> how

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:44.800 
that would be important considering how

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:47.310 
that would be important considering how

actually really interesting there's so

00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:01.200 
actually really interesting there's so
many<00:05:59.260> theories<00:05:59.740> as<00:05:59.980> to<00:06:00.010> why<00:06:00.430> he's<00:06:00.760> walking

many theories as to why he's walking

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:02.670 
many theories as to why he's walking
around<00:06:01.300> in<00:06:01.600> disguise<00:06:01.720> you'll<00:06:02.110> notice<00:06:02.470> that<00:06:02.500> it

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:02.680 
around in disguise you'll notice that it

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:05.670

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:12.720 
glowing and he is hidden in plain sight
really<00:06:11.260> trying<00:06:11.710> to<00:06:11.830> cover<00:06:12.040> up<00:06:12.130> the<00:06:12.340> fact<00:06:12.370> that

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:12.730 
really trying to cover up the fact that

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:15.930 
really trying to cover up the fact that
he<00:06:12.970> is<00:06:13.180> an<00:06:13.420> Android<00:06:14.050> now<00:06:14.550> remember<00:06:15.550> that<00:06:15.580> this

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:15.940 
he is an Android now remember that this

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:19.110 
he is an Android now remember that this
is<00:06:16.090> Boston<00:06:16.330> this<00:06:16.840> is<00:06:17.020> the<00:06:17.140> hometown<00:06:17.770> of<00:06:18.120> MIT

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:19.120 
is Boston this is the hometown of MIT

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:23.250 
is Boston this is the hometown of MIT
we're<00:06:19.780> geniuses<00:06:20.320> work<00:06:21.040> and<00:06:21.370> play<00:06:21.970> so<00:06:22.930> I<00:06:22.960> would

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:23.260 
we're geniuses work and play so I would

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:24.780 
we're geniuses work and play so I would
imagine<00:06:23.500> perhaps<00:06:24.010> they're<00:06:24.160> trying<00:06:24.490> to<00:06:24.610> create

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:24.790 
imagine perhaps they're trying to create

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:27.000 
imagine perhaps they're trying to create
some<00:06:25.060> sort<00:06:25.270> of<00:06:25.360> new<00:06:25.600> technology<00:06:26.470> to<00:06:26.680> really

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:27.010 
some sort of new technology to really

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:29.580 
some sort of new technology to really
survive<00:06:27.610> the<00:06:27.880> wasteland<00:06:28.420> beyond<00:06:28.990> normal

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:29.590 
survive the wasteland beyond normal

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:31.890 
survive the wasteland beyond normal
means<00:06:30.070> maybe<00:06:30.430> that<00:06:30.880> is<00:06:31.120> what<00:06:31.330> is<00:06:31.510> going<00:06:31.780> on

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:31.900 
means maybe that is what is going on

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:34.050 
means maybe that is what is going on
here<00:06:32.320> some<00:06:33.190> people<00:06:33.430> think<00:06:33.520> that<00:06:33.640> this<00:06:33.790> is<00:06:33.850> the

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:34.060 
here some people think that this is the

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:35.880 
here some people think that this is the
main<00:06:34.270> protagonist<00:06:35.050> that<00:06:35.140> we<00:06:35.260> are<00:06:35.410> seeing<00:06:35.650> in

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:35.890 
main protagonist that we are seeing in

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:37.590 
main protagonist that we are seeing in
this<00:06:36.070> screenshot<00:06:36.310> i<00:06:36.580> do<00:06:36.700> not<00:06:37.030> think<00:06:37.060> this<00:06:37.450> is

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:37.600 
this screenshot i do not think this is

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:39.570 
this screenshot i do not think this is
the<00:06:37.660> main<00:06:37.810> protagonist<00:06:38.410> in<00:06:38.560> fact<00:06:39.340> i<00:06:39.550> think

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:39.580 
the main protagonist in fact i think

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:41.370 
the main protagonist in fact i think
this<00:06:40.000> will<00:06:40.210> be<00:06:40.270> a<00:06:40.420> character<00:06:40.810> that<00:06:40.900> you<00:06:41.080> may

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:41.380 
this will be a character that you may

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:44.640 
this will be a character that you may
end<00:06:41.710> up<00:06:42.330> playing<00:06:43.330> with<00:06:43.450> as<00:06:43.720> a<00:06:43.750> companion<00:06:44.290> at

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:44.650 
end up playing with as a companion at

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:46.140 
end up playing with as a companion at
your<00:06:45.010> side<00:06:45.310> perhaps<00:06:45.880> your

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:46.150 
your side perhaps your

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:47.950 
in diamond city or something like that

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:50.940 
in diamond city or something like that
of<00:06:48.640> course<00:06:48.880> he<00:06:49.030> may<00:06:49.180> be<00:06:49.240> just<00:06:49.420> hanging<00:06:49.750> out<00:06:49.950> out

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:50.950 
of course he may be just hanging out out

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:53.280 
of course he may be just hanging out out
memory<00:06:51.430> lane<00:06:51.700> trying<00:06:52.540> to<00:06:52.630> get<00:06:52.810> you<00:06:52.900> to<00:06:52.990> go<00:06:53.110> in
