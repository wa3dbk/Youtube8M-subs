let's<00:03:19.190> think<00:03:19.430> it<00:03:19.580> needs<00:03:19.760> to<00:03:19.849> be<00:03:19.910> and<00:03:20.630> after<00:03:21.110> C

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:21.230 
let's think it needs to be and after C

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:24.250 
let's think it needs to be and after C
getting<00:03:21.440> there<00:03:22.480> and<00:03:23.480> that's<00:03:23.660> basically

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:24.260 
getting there and that's basically

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:25.720 
getting there and that's basically
that's<00:03:24.560> your<00:03:24.680> mother<00:03:24.920> way<00:03:25.069> reach<00:03:25.280> for
