careful because these guys share a
health<00:01:04.509> bar<00:01:04.750> which<00:01:05.500> means<00:01:05.710> you<00:01:05.829> need<00:01:05.920> to<00:01:05.979> be

health bar which means you need to be

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:07.590 
health bar which means you need to be
particularly<00:01:06.610> careful<00:01:06.670> about<00:01:07.180> the<00:01:07.329> amount<00:01:07.479> of

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:07.600 
particularly careful about the amount of

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.360 
particularly careful about the amount of
damage<00:01:07.869> you're<00:01:08.020> taking<00:01:08.380> the<00:01:08.890> good<00:01:09.040> news<00:01:09.220> is

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:09.370 
damage you're taking the good news is

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:10.950 
damage you're taking the good news is
that<00:01:09.400> when<00:01:09.700> you<00:01:09.820> start<00:01:10.090> healing<00:01:10.360> yourself<00:01:10.540> and

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:10.960 
that when you start healing yourself and

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:12.990 
that when you start healing yourself and
this<00:01:11.020> bank<00:01:11.260> can<00:01:11.409> do<00:01:11.530> that<00:01:11.710> by<00:01:12.370> drinking<00:01:12.940> a

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:13.000 
this bank can do that by drinking a

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.510 
this bank can do that by drinking a
potion<00:01:13.210> or<00:01:13.450> eating<00:01:13.659> food<00:01:14.130> both<00:01:15.130> characters

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:15.520 
potion or eating food both characters

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.230 
potion or eating food both characters
will<00:01:15.729> be<00:01:15.820> healed<00:01:16.030> at<00:01:16.180> the<00:01:16.240> same<00:01:16.450> time<00:01:18.150> so<00:01:19.150> we're

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:19.240 
will be healed at the same time so we're

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:20.399 
will be healed at the same time so we're
going<00:01:19.330> to<00:01:19.420> take<00:01:19.540> out<00:01:19.750> the<00:01:19.870> last<00:01:20.049> couple<00:01:20.380> of

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:20.409 
going to take out the last couple of

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:24.360 
going to take out the last couple of
walks<00:01:20.620> and<00:01:22.290> then<00:01:23.290> we'll<00:01:23.380> take<00:01:23.530> a<00:01:23.590> look<00:01:23.770> at<00:01:23.979> the

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:24.370 
walks and then we'll take a look at the

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:27.420 
walks and then we'll take a look at the
PIP<00:01:24.700> village<00:01:25.060> and<00:01:25.650> this<00:01:26.650> will<00:01:26.770> be<00:01:26.890> a<00:01:27.100> little

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:27.430 
PIP village and this will be a little

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:29.880 
PIP village and this will be a little
bit<00:01:27.580> more<00:01:27.670> difficult<00:01:27.909> so<00:01:28.810> we'll<00:01:29.140> explore<00:01:29.470> some

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:29.890 
bit more difficult so we'll explore some

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:32.850 
bit more difficult so we'll explore some
of<00:01:29.920> the<00:01:30.190> other<00:01:31.380> techniques<00:01:32.380> that<00:01:32.530> these<00:01:32.710> guys

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:32.860 
of the other techniques that these guys

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:36.960 
of the other techniques that these guys
can<00:01:33.100> use<00:01:33.280> together<00:01:35.340> this<00:01:36.340> is<00:01:36.490> sparkles

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:36.970 
can use together this is sparkles

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:41.039 
can use together this is sparkles

flamethrower attack as a hint and tip

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:43.289 
flamethrower attack as a hint and tip
you<00:01:41.380> might<00:01:41.560> find<00:01:41.740> it<00:01:41.890> valuable<00:01:42.010> for<00:01:42.580> des<00:01:43.090> bank

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:43.299 
you might find it valuable for des bank

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:46.320 
you might find it valuable for des bank
to<00:01:43.420> hang<00:01:43.630> back<00:01:43.869> and<00:01:44.760> these<00:01:45.760> ranged<00:01:46.060> attacks

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:46.330 
to hang back and these ranged attacks

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:47.760 
to hang back and these ranged attacks
while<00:01:46.510> sparkles<00:01:46.990> holds<00:01:47.290> them<00:01:47.380> at<00:01:47.470> bay<00:01:47.619> with

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:47.770 
while sparkles holds them at bay with

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:50.100 
while sparkles holds them at bay with
the<00:01:47.860> flames<00:01:48.510> then<00:01:49.510> we<00:01:49.600> have<00:01:49.689> des<00:01:49.869> banks

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:50.110 
the flames then we have des banks
