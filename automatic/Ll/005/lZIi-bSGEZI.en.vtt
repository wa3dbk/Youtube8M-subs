 out of the dlc you could just see 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.320
 this car from the front and I 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.940

 you have it because this has changed the 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.550
 design of this 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.650

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:20.850

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.760

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.050

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:27.120

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:31.710
 more ball this is the one we're going to 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.410
 street yes yes yes yes honestly salaries 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.330
 not the one that goes to mÃ©mora is the yellow 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:37.350

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:39.119

 I know millions because I could not buy or 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:47.610

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:49.020
 So, well, from here I send you a 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.850
 greeting and thanks to writings that I 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.440
 is leaving all these vehicles what 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.970
 said is that he has good taste because he has 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:55.920
 caught the most handsome color the wta that 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.930
 This one is the coolest and says it so that 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.460
 does not have and the truth that costs 845,000 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.690
 I think we've seen let's try a 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.450
 little speed and the whole subject to 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:07.300
 see let's run around here pretty much 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:09.040
 for maximum power obviously it's not 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:11.080
 the fastest car that is online is 

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:13.180
 very clear but yes that aesthetically 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:15.520
 I'd say it's one of the ones that calls me the most 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:18.140
 the attention to this day I do not know why 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:20.810
 but I love dude 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:22.069
 very a bone in this very awesome car of 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:24.580
 truth I say it honestly has 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:24.580
 charmed 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:32.080
 what is said here, you have to leave a 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:33.640
 piece of the contract to others 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.260
 cars and you are the other vehicles that 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.610
 they are teaching it in videos and that is how it is 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.810
 that here I say goodbye with this car to 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:42.630
 maximum power to enjoy the 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:42.630
 favorite if we go to 22
