00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:26.900
 [Music] 

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:30.200

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:33.590

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:36.050
 potato cheese rolls and our rich 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:39.320
 pico de gallo sauce that they already have 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:41.530
 there in the channel the recipe well first 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:44.789
 let's warm up 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:44.789
 the beans 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:14.150
 more fried this is bolillo bolillo bueno 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:17.300
 here in Mexico we got it in the 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:19.420
 bakeries with shoes too if not 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:21.740
 they get bobbin somewhere in cycle 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:25.800
 Any fan that you do not like 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:25.800
 [Music] 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:54.310
 if they are going to give it to the children 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:57.640
 they put salsita pico de gallo a la 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:02:01.120
 lioness of children without chili if it is better 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:03.990
 that they make one because it is very tasty 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:07.450
 or for people who do not eat chile 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:11.050
 are our bobbin now we are going to 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:14.390
 put our cheese and potato this 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:16.760
 they also have in the channel how to do it 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:20.110
 if it is the case of the low type and by 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.110
 where exactly 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:43.400
 [Music] 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:43.400
 so that we are well extended 

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:47.410
 look that it seems that it melted 

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:55.830
 and they are going to see how it got very rich gold 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:58.620
 because I'm going to take them cheese 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:01.950
 melted but afterwards if they do not eat they do not want 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:03.990
 or they can not eat dairy because this is 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:07.380
 a very good option 

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:09.960
 for all my vegan family 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:13.600
 they do not have to be limited in eliminating 

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:17.500
 they can also eat their dolls 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:20.730
 already being that way we're going to get 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:22.740
 the oven will put in an oven 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:25.400
 and electric 

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:27.180
 but you just put or whatever you want 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:30.949
 inscribe that they have 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:30.949
 [Music] 

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:36.550
 well I'm going to turn it on 

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:46.330
 and so that it is but if they do it in a 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:48.640
 modest 180 and if you have please in the 

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:53.380
 part of them down for a little while there 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:57.310
 watching them so that free for 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:04:00.370
 to be the cheese in this case is because 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:04.569
 above this has the tenderloin has as 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:07.599
 some of the grill above did not want 

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:11.680
 a resistance that is while 

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:14.769
 warms the pain in which over 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:17.070
 they all have one gas disco 'loba' in 

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:18.160
 a little while so they also brown in the 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:20.400
 side stand 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:23.690
 [Music] 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:26.000
 they put it a little in the oven about 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:29.780
 10-15 minutes to warm up the 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:32.840
 bread and lower it to brown high at 24 time 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:33.310
 here until it's finished here it's going 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:38.020
 indicating 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:40.509
 [Music] 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:44.580
 Well, I see that leaving this 

00:04:40.509 --> 00:04:44.580
 they want to burn me I 'm going to bring them closer 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:53.220
 so much now about 

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:53.220
 15 10 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:05:00.650
 at this point they serve and they put the 

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:03.890
 salsita this little golden that the question 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:07.040
 interrupt the pico de gallo sauce 

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:09.080
 you put it since they are so exact you see that 

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:11.639
 hard as long as they serve themselves well 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:15.180
 hot 

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:19.690
 we also have our dolls already 

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:24.010
 served with fried beans with the 

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:28.030
 dad's cheese and gratin type is already 

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:29.610
 little golden that we go to the branch we are going to 

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:33.289
 put him 

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:33.289
 the peak salsita tell 

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:48.300
 and this for a breakfast like orange or 

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:51.090
 a fruit plate needs an illy coffee 

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:55.050
 its very well is a Saturday or a Sunday 

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:56.310
 midweek does not matter but with this 

00:05:55.050 --> 00:06:00.090
 they have children they will love 

00:05:56.310 --> 00:06:02.660
 nothing more than putting the sauces and girls 

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:05.180
 the children who put him 

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:06.830
 [Music] 

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:12.340
 really the salsita of the body in the 

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:12.340
 calcium over for children could be 

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:12.629
