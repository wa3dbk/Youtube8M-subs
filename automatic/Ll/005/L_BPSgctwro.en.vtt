week's particular instrument is a 1971
Martin<00:00:09.840> d-35<00:00:10.320> that<00:00:11.250> came<00:00:11.519> in<00:00:11.790> with<00:00:12.570> most<00:00:13.259> of

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
Martin d-35 that came in with most of

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.369 
Martin d-35 that came in with most of
the<00:00:13.559> binding<00:00:14.099> actually<00:00:14.910> off<00:00:15.150> and<00:00:15.599> several

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
the binding actually off and several

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.279 
the binding actually off and several
areas<00:00:16.830> of<00:00:16.859> the<00:00:17.100> back<00:00:17.400> and<00:00:17.699> the<00:00:17.820> top<00:00:18.289> separating

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
areas of the back and the top separating

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.890 
areas of the back and the top separating
from<00:00:19.439> the<00:00:19.529> body<00:00:19.939> the<00:00:20.939> bridge<00:00:21.240> was<00:00:21.510> also

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
from the body the bridge was also

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.279 
from the body the bridge was also
pulling<00:00:22.170> up<00:00:22.500> and<00:00:23.300> needed<00:00:24.300> to<00:00:24.539> be<00:00:24.689> reglued

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
pulling up and needed to be reglued

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.589 
pulling up and needed to be reglued
and<00:00:25.560> the<00:00:26.430> bridge<00:00:26.609> also<00:00:26.849> had<00:00:27.060> to<00:00:27.150> be<00:00:27.269> carved

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
and the bridge also had to be carved

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.550 
and the bridge also had to be carved
down<00:00:28.160> to<00:00:29.160> bring<00:00:29.400> the<00:00:29.550> action<00:00:29.939> down<00:00:30.119> as<00:00:30.330> well<00:00:30.599> so

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
down to bring the action down as well so

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.639 
down to bring the action down as well so
it<00:00:32.460> was<00:00:32.669> imperative<00:00:33.120> because<00:00:33.750> of<00:00:34.110> its<00:00:34.230> age

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
it was imperative because of its age

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.319 
it was imperative because of its age
that<00:00:35.640> the<00:00:36.800> rege<00:00:37.800> luang<00:00:38.309> and<00:00:38.579> even<00:00:38.910> the<00:00:39.000> finish

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
that the rege luang and even the finish

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.209 
that the rege luang and even the finish
touch<00:00:39.600> up<00:00:39.870> match<00:00:40.170> exactly

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
touch up match exactly

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.529 
touch up match exactly
now<00:00:41.960> the<00:00:42.960> binding<00:00:43.500> is<00:00:43.680> a<00:00:44.219> three<00:00:44.789> layer<00:00:45.030> type

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
now the binding is a three layer type

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.709 
now the binding is a three layer type
that<00:00:46.350> is<00:00:46.739> actually<00:00:47.579> you've<00:00:48.059> got<00:00:48.239> the<00:00:48.480> long

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
that is actually you've got the long

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.420 
that is actually you've got the long
it's<00:00:49.140> actually<00:00:49.289> four<00:00:49.739> layers<00:00:50.010> because<00:00:50.280> you've

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
it's actually four layers because you've

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.389 
it's actually four layers because you've
got<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:50.820> main<00:00:51.059> length<00:00:52.020> along<00:00:52.860> the<00:00:53.070> edge<00:00:53.190> but

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
got the main length along the edge but

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.310 
got the main length along the edge but
then<00:00:53.520> you've<00:00:53.640> got<00:00:53.670> a<00:00:53.850> smaller<00:00:54.360> layer

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
then you've got a smaller layer

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.099 
then you've got a smaller layer
underneath<00:00:55.860> that<00:00:56.309> then<00:00:57.090> the<00:00:57.300> inner<00:00:57.539> layers

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
underneath that then the inner layers

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.069 
underneath that then the inner layers
here<00:00:58.770> actually<00:00:59.370> sit<00:00:59.640> on<00:00:59.760> a<00:00:59.789> step<00:01:00.270> so<00:01:00.660> they're

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
here actually sit on a step so they're

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.820 
here actually sit on a step so they're
even<00:01:01.260> shorter<00:01:01.969> so<00:01:03.019> it's<00:01:04.019> kind<00:01:04.320> of<00:01:04.350> tricky<00:01:04.799> to

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
even shorter so it's kind of tricky to

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.219 
even shorter so it's kind of tricky to
be<00:01:05.040> able<00:01:05.339> to<00:01:05.519> get<00:01:06.330> them<00:01:06.510> to<00:01:06.630> all<00:01:06.659> align

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
be able to get them to all align

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.090 
be able to get them to all align
properly<00:01:08.270> and<00:01:09.270> it<00:01:09.390> took<00:01:09.540> some<00:01:10.100> maneuvering

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
properly and it took some maneuvering

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.370 
properly and it took some maneuvering
the<00:01:11.880> main<00:01:12.150> reason<00:01:12.600> that<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.840> binding<00:01:13.260> had

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
the main reason that the binding had

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.039 
the main reason that the binding had
separated<00:01:13.920> was<00:01:14.220> that<00:01:14.790> it<00:01:15.119> had<00:01:15.299> shrank<00:01:15.689> over

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
separated was that it had shrank over

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.070 
separated was that it had shrank over
the<00:01:16.200> years<00:01:16.380> so<00:01:17.100> I<00:01:17.490> also<00:01:18.000> had<00:01:18.299> to<00:01:18.420> heat<00:01:18.689> up<00:01:18.720> the

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
the years so I also had to heat up the

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.200 
the years so I also had to heat up the
binding<00:01:19.530> to<00:01:19.710> expand<00:01:20.189> it<00:01:20.340> so<00:01:20.759> that<00:01:20.939> way<00:01:21.060> it

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
binding to expand it so that way it

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.039 
binding to expand it so that way it
would<00:01:21.299> fit<00:01:21.540> back<00:01:21.689> in<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:22.020> channel<00:01:22.259> this<00:01:23.250> this

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:24.049 
would fit back in the channel this this

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:26.390 
would fit back in the channel this this
middle<00:01:25.049> layer<00:01:25.229> and<00:01:25.259> the<00:01:25.740> outer<00:01:25.920> layer<00:01:26.220> of

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
middle layer and the outer layer of

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.690 
middle layer and the outer layer of
course<00:01:26.580> were<00:01:26.700> broken<00:01:26.970> so<00:01:28.130> no<00:01:29.130> amount<00:01:29.250> of<00:01:29.520> heat

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
course were broken so no amount of heat

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.160 
course were broken so no amount of heat
and<00:01:29.939> expansion<00:01:30.450> is<00:01:30.540> really<00:01:30.840> going<00:01:30.990> to<00:01:31.049> help

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
and expansion is really going to help

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.230 
and expansion is really going to help
all<00:01:31.380> that<00:01:31.409> much<00:01:31.560> when<00:01:32.070> it<00:01:32.340> doesn't<00:01:32.759> it<00:01:32.909> doesn't

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
all that much when it doesn't it doesn't

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.830 
all that much when it doesn't it doesn't
have<00:01:33.360> a<00:01:33.390> solid<00:01:33.720> hold<00:01:34.680> on<00:01:34.979> both<00:01:35.220> ends<00:01:35.520> so<00:01:36.299> I<00:01:36.630> was

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
have a solid hold on both ends so I was

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.730 
have a solid hold on both ends so I was
able<00:01:37.020> to<00:01:37.200> heat<00:01:37.680> it<00:01:37.860> and<00:01:38.630> reglue<00:01:39.630> them<00:01:39.869> and<00:01:40.110> I

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
able to heat it and reglue them and I

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.499 
able to heat it and reglue them and I
think<00:01:40.799> it<00:01:41.130> came<00:01:41.250> out<00:01:41.310> pretty<00:01:41.490> well<00:01:42.000> the

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
think it came out pretty well the

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.560 
think it came out pretty well the
binding<00:01:42.899> was<00:01:43.020> also<00:01:43.439> separated<00:01:44.399> not<00:01:45.329> as

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
binding was also separated not as

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.270 
binding was also separated not as
extremely<00:01:46.049> as<00:01:46.259> this<00:01:46.439> but<00:01:46.710> mainly<00:01:46.920> the<00:01:47.130> outer

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
extremely as this but mainly the outer

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.569 
extremely as this but mainly the outer
areas<00:01:47.909> and<00:01:48.299> some<00:01:48.869> of<00:01:49.020> the<00:01:49.110> inner<00:01:49.290> areas<00:01:49.770> around

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
areas and some of the inner areas around

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:54.170 
areas and some of the inner areas around
basically<00:01:51.329> all<00:01:51.659> the<00:01:51.869> solder<00:01:52.280> four<00:01:53.280> portions

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
basically all the solder four portions

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.480 
basically all the solder four portions
as<00:01:54.390> well<00:01:54.960> as<00:01:55.110> the<00:01:55.259> back<00:01:55.470> the<00:01:55.979> back<00:01:56.250> was

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
as well as the back the back was

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.950 
as well as the back the back was
separating<00:01:57.210> out<00:01:57.390> in<00:01:57.689> various<00:01:58.590> spots

00:01:59.950 --> 00:01:59.960 
separating out in various spots

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.709 
separating out in various spots
throughout<00:02:00.960> as<00:02:01.259> well<00:02:01.290> as<00:02:01.469> the<00:02:01.740> top<00:02:01.979> the<00:02:02.719> bridge

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
throughout as well as the top the bridge

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.859 
throughout as well as the top the bridge
I<00:02:04.020> had<00:02:04.170> to<00:02:04.320> remove<00:02:04.820> clean<00:02:05.820> the<00:02:06.030> area<00:02:06.390> and<00:02:06.719> then

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
I had to remove clean the area and then

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:10.100 
I had to remove clean the area and then
reglue<00:02:07.500> but<00:02:08.399> the<00:02:09.239> client<00:02:09.569> also<00:02:09.780> complained

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
reglue but the client also complained

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:10.400 
reglue but the client also complained
that<00:02:10.170> the

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
that the

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.750 
that the
Ashlin<00:02:10.710> was<00:02:10.800> fairly<00:02:11.040> high<00:02:12.650> but<00:02:13.650> since<00:02:14.100> the

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
Ashlin was fairly high but since the

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.760 
Ashlin was fairly high but since the
saddle<00:02:15.270> was<00:02:15.450> actually<00:02:15.840> glued<00:02:16.140> into<00:02:16.440> the

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
saddle was actually glued into the

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:18.350 
saddle was actually glued into the
bridge<00:02:17.010> there<00:02:17.220> was<00:02:17.310> no<00:02:17.460> way<00:02:17.610> to<00:02:17.640> remove<00:02:17.910> that

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
bridge there was no way to remove that

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.630 
bridge there was no way to remove that
to<00:02:18.510> basically<00:02:18.810> be<00:02:19.020> able<00:02:19.080> to<00:02:19.260> carve<00:02:19.470> it<00:02:19.620> down<00:02:19.830> so

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
to basically be able to carve it down so

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:26.780 
to basically be able to carve it down so
I<00:02:20.670> had<00:02:21.000> to<00:02:21.150> use<00:02:21.360> my<00:02:21.690> my<00:02:22.440> Dremel<00:02:23.330> flex<00:02:24.980> tool<00:02:25.980> to

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
I had to use my my Dremel flex tool to

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.570 
I had to use my my Dremel flex tool to
basically<00:02:26.940> go<00:02:27.540> in<00:02:27.690> there<00:02:27.870> and<00:02:28.080> carve<00:02:28.620> this

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
basically go in there and carve this

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.630 
basically go in there and carve this
entire<00:02:30.030> area<00:02:30.390> and<00:02:30.840> then<00:02:31.590> carve<00:02:32.190> down<00:02:32.400> the

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
entire area and then carve down the

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.250 
entire area and then carve down the
bridge<00:02:32.880> saddle<00:02:33.300> just<00:02:33.540> right<00:02:33.870> and<00:02:34.050> then<00:02:34.140> of

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
bridge saddle just right and then of

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:35.690 
bridge saddle just right and then of
course<00:02:34.500> I<00:02:34.650> increased<00:02:35.160> the<00:02:35.220> length<00:02:35.430> of<00:02:35.610> these

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
course I increased the length of these

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.760 
course I increased the length of these
slots<00:02:36.030> and<00:02:36.360> strings<00:02:36.840> cut<00:02:37.170> at<00:02:37.290> the<00:02:37.380> correct

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 
slots and strings cut at the correct

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:39.680 
slots and strings cut at the correct
angle<00:02:38.010> and<00:02:38.490> I<00:02:38.850> think<00:02:39.060> I<00:02:39.120> did<00:02:39.270> a<00:02:39.300> pretty<00:02:39.360> good

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
angle and I think I did a pretty good

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.930 
angle and I think I did a pretty good
job<00:02:39.750> now<00:02:40.620> you<00:02:40.860> can<00:02:41.010> look<00:02:41.160> closely<00:02:41.430> at<00:02:41.730> the<00:02:41.820> way

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
job now you can look closely at the way

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.060 
job now you can look closely at the way
the<00:02:42.090> binding<00:02:42.540> was<00:02:42.690> done<00:02:42.930> I<00:02:43.200> can't<00:02:43.740> even<00:02:43.830> tell

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:44.070 
the binding was done I can't even tell

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:48.260 
the binding was done I can't even tell
it<00:02:44.250> was<00:02:44.400> repaired<00:02:45.890> likewise<00:02:46.890> with<00:02:47.250> the<00:02:47.280> the

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:48.270 
it was repaired likewise with the the

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:51.110 
it was repaired likewise with the the
the<00:02:49.110> renewing<00:02:49.620> of<00:02:49.740> the<00:02:49.770> back<00:02:50.070> the<00:02:50.520> end<00:02:50.700> result

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
the renewing of the back the end result

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:52.730 
the renewing of the back the end result
is<00:02:51.330> a<00:02:51.360> guitar<00:02:51.690> that's<00:02:51.810> got<00:02:52.020> really<00:02:52.320> nice

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:52.740 
is a guitar that's got really nice

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:57.230 
is a guitar that's got really nice
action<00:02:53.190> and<00:02:53.550> plays<00:02:53.790> very<00:02:54.090> beautifully<00:02:54.750> and<00:02:56.240> it

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:57.240 
action and plays very beautifully and it

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:25.679 
action and plays very beautifully and it
has<00:02:57.420> a<00:02:57.450> fantastic<00:02:57.780> sound<00:02:58.620> toe<00:02:58.950> to

00:03:25.679 --> 00:03:25.689 

00:03:25.689 --> 00:03:28.869 

it's<00:03:26.689> a<00:03:26.810> great<00:03:27.079> guitar<00:03:27.560> well<00:03:28.340> the<00:03:28.489> other<00:03:28.670> thing

00:03:28.869 --> 00:03:28.879 
it's a great guitar well the other thing

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:30.640 
it's a great guitar well the other thing
that<00:03:28.909> I<00:03:29.060> had<00:03:29.180> to<00:03:29.299> do<00:03:29.420> also<00:03:29.810> was<00:03:30.079> the<00:03:30.260> pit<00:03:30.439> guard

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.650 
that I had to do also was the pit guard

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:33.099 
that I had to do also was the pit guard
was<00:03:30.799> missing<00:03:31.219> and<00:03:31.459> the<00:03:32.150> area<00:03:32.510> of<00:03:32.659> wood<00:03:32.900> where

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:33.109 
was missing and the area of wood where

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:34.479 
was missing and the area of wood where
the<00:03:33.230> pick<00:03:33.409> guard<00:03:33.439> originally<00:03:34.069> was<00:03:34.189> glued<00:03:34.459> to

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:34.489 
the pick guard originally was glued to

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:37.179 
the pick guard originally was glued to
was<00:03:35.269> actually<00:03:35.629> lifting<00:03:36.019> up<00:03:36.169> so<00:03:36.739> I<00:03:36.769> had<00:03:37.069> to

00:03:37.179 --> 00:03:37.189 
was actually lifting up so I had to

00:03:37.189 --> 00:03:40.740 
was actually lifting up so I had to
reglue<00:03:37.459> that<00:03:37.730> and<00:03:38.060> I<00:03:38.780> also<00:03:39.290> shellacked<00:03:39.919> the

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:40.750 
reglue that and I also shellacked the

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:43.209 
reglue that and I also shellacked the
area<00:03:41.750> itself<00:03:42.109> where<00:03:42.349> the<00:03:42.379> pick<00:03:42.650> guard<00:03:42.680> belongs

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:43.219 
area itself where the pick guard belongs

00:03:43.219 --> 00:03:45.009 
area itself where the pick guard belongs
so<00:03:43.459> that<00:03:43.639> when<00:03:43.879> I<00:03:43.909> stuck<00:03:44.299> on<00:03:44.450> the<00:03:44.629> new<00:03:44.780> pit

00:03:45.009 --> 00:03:45.019 
so that when I stuck on the new pit

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:47.379 
so that when I stuck on the new pit
guard<00:03:45.290> it<00:03:45.980> would<00:03:46.250> actually<00:03:46.609> stick<00:03:46.909> on<00:03:47.090> to<00:03:47.359> a

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:47.389 
guard it would actually stick on to a

00:03:47.389 --> 00:03:49.809 
guard it would actually stick on to a
finished<00:03:47.989> surface<00:03:48.590> rather<00:03:49.189> than<00:03:49.400> the<00:03:49.609> bare

00:03:49.809 --> 00:03:49.819 
finished surface rather than the bare

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:51.729 
finished surface rather than the bare
wood<00:03:50.060> surface<00:03:50.480> so<00:03:50.629> that<00:03:50.810> in<00:03:50.989> the<00:03:51.079> future<00:03:51.260> if<00:03:51.620> it

00:03:51.729 --> 00:03:51.739 
wood surface so that in the future if it

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:54.759 
wood surface so that in the future if it
does<00:03:52.010> start<00:03:52.430> to<00:03:52.760> pull<00:03:53.389> away<00:03:53.540> again<00:03:54.019> it'll

00:03:54.759 --> 00:03:54.769 
does start to pull away again it'll

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:56.830 
does start to pull away again it'll
actually<00:03:55.129> pull<00:03:55.579> away<00:03:55.699> easier<00:03:56.269> rather<00:03:56.540> than

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:56.840 
actually pull away easier rather than

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.349 
actually pull away easier rather than
what<00:03:57.290> it<00:03:57.409> usually<00:03:57.769> does<00:03:57.949> does<00:03:58.519> which<00:03:58.760> is<00:03:58.790> it

00:03:59.349 --> 00:03:59.359 
what it usually does does which is it

00:03:59.359 --> 00:04:02.050 
what it usually does does which is it
shrinks<00:04:00.049> and<00:04:00.199> it<00:04:00.799> actually<00:04:01.159> splits<00:04:01.609> the<00:04:01.819> wood

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:02.060 
shrinks and it actually splits the wood

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:04.439 
shrinks and it actually splits the wood
it<00:04:02.540> was<00:04:02.659> actually<00:04:03.199> splitting<00:04:03.680> a<00:04:03.889> bit<00:04:04.069> too

00:04:04.439 --> 00:04:04.449 
it was actually splitting a bit too

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:07.059 
it was actually splitting a bit too
which<00:04:05.449> was<00:04:05.629> very<00:04:05.930> common<00:04:06.290> especially<00:04:06.650> with

00:04:07.059 --> 00:04:07.069 
which was very common especially with

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:10.559 
which was very common especially with
old<00:04:07.219> Martens<00:04:07.699> so<00:04:08.419> I<00:04:08.840> took<00:04:09.230> care<00:04:09.439> of<00:04:09.469> that<00:04:09.680> and

00:04:10.559 --> 00:04:10.569 
old Martens so I took care of that and

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:12.789 
old Martens so I took care of that and
you<00:04:11.569> can<00:04:11.599> see<00:04:11.840> the<00:04:11.989> pickguard<00:04:12.259> fits<00:04:12.620> on

00:04:12.789 --> 00:04:12.799 
you can see the pickguard fits on

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:15.460 
you can see the pickguard fits on
beautifully<00:04:13.370> the<00:04:14.060> guitar<00:04:14.389> also<00:04:14.750> had<00:04:15.019> the

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:15.470 
beautifully the guitar also had the

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:18.159 
beautifully the guitar also had the
owner<00:04:15.739> had<00:04:15.919> a<00:04:16.190> barkas<00:04:17.030> berry<00:04:17.299> pickup<00:04:17.810> put<00:04:18.019> in

00:04:18.159 --> 00:04:18.169 
owner had a barkas berry pickup put in

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:20.920 
owner had a barkas berry pickup put in
underneath<00:04:18.739> the<00:04:18.949> bridge<00:04:19.359> under<00:04:20.359> the<00:04:20.479> top<00:04:20.690> it's

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:20.930 
underneath the bridge under the top it's

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:23.170 
underneath the bridge under the top it's
one<00:04:21.109> of<00:04:21.199> those<00:04:21.289> bar<00:04:21.620> types<00:04:21.979> that<00:04:22.610> stick<00:04:23.030> on

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:23.180 
one of those bar types that stick on

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:26.290 
one of those bar types that stick on
with<00:04:23.419> dealt<00:04:23.659> with<00:04:23.979> contact<00:04:24.979> cement<00:04:25.130> and<00:04:25.550> so

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:26.300 
with dealt with contact cement and so

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:27.999 
with dealt with contact cement and so
that<00:04:26.479> had<00:04:26.599> to<00:04:26.630> be<00:04:26.840> removed<00:04:26.990> so<00:04:27.500> that<00:04:27.530> I<00:04:27.680> could

00:04:27.999 --> 00:04:28.009 
that had to be removed so that I could

00:04:28.009 --> 00:04:30.580 
that had to be removed so that I could
reglue<00:04:28.820> the<00:04:28.940> bridge<00:04:29.210> then<00:04:29.870> I<00:04:29.900> glued<00:04:30.289> it<00:04:30.380> back

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:30.590 
reglue the bridge then I glued it back

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:33.700 
reglue the bridge then I glued it back
on<00:04:30.830> and<00:04:31.599> you<00:04:32.599> know<00:04:32.690> it's<00:04:32.900> it's<00:04:33.229> actually<00:04:33.680> a
