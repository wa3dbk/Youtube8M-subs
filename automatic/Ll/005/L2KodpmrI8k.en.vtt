00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.710
 Yoo Young-gu, who went to the mechanical engineering high school because of a little family trouble, 

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:15.210
 While this feature is beginning to learn the weld where the sea with his welding skills 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:19.230
 I have a dream to make a large ship that sails . 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:21.750
 At that time, however, the proportion of automatic welding in the shipbuilding industry was just over 20% 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:25.859
 It was a bad situation. 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:27.570
 You can not fold your dreams just by developing your own welding skills 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:31.980
 Start 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:36.930
 Then one day, the function will have a sense of sensation. 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:42.879
 After that, I could not see the second and third years instantly. 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:46.930
 Note the harvest being the first hospital called this three layers haeteotneundeyo 

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:51.970
 How can I not be so kelly? 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:55.180
 Up to one year, snow conditions, 100% 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:01:01.449
 8cd 4 cornea was burnt 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:07.220
 I was feeling a little weak because of the assault I had, and I took it with this 

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:11.630
 How much will be the first time the man was doing some Takane deodeo 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:12.780
 Oh features that require painful Frau floor of an accident 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:17.130
 U 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:18.690
 But he is still suffering from a poor bald environment. 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:24.110
 In a sense of responsibility 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:24.110
 I will overcome my sleeping fear and come back to the scene again. 

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:34.630
 5 US function succeeded in developing automatic welding machine for one and a half years 

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:39.030
 The new welding machine for only one worker is 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:39.030
 Welding technology is transferred together. 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:46.420
 This Automatic Welder can work by turning the head 180 degrees narrowly 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:53.550
 By development 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:53.550
 Workers can easily and completely weld irregular steel plates 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:02:02.060
 5 Looking at the volumetric parts and even the problems that may arise 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:05.540
 Teaching function 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:07.430
 The land I'm receiving a lot of heat 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:13.550
 When blood grows, 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:15.710
 When proceeding to the framing di push is connected in a two and two and a half alcohol c where 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:19.760
 Housing and subject 

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:23.960
 I ate my parents would be hard not to expose the research and development 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:28.340
 But if you do research and development 

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:32.540
 Huck that if they accumulate data from Holloway 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:35.960
 I feel better knowing that narcissism to delight adults Heb. 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:41.870
 My table is broken, 

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:46.760
 When I was exhibited to the people who wear these Dojo clothes, 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:50.740
 Kkeora mind is very helpful and the whole idea was to me that Assistant 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.740
 I thought it was good to open it. 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:03:01.780
 The blocks that have been welded indoors are transported by special transport equipment called transporters. 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:06.430
 The ship will eventually drift into the Gospel. 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:09.690
 A ps porter with 100 large wheels will move blocks of up to 600 tons 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:09.690
 Made to be 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:19.400
 8 Supports to guide the homeostasis when the transporter moves 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:23.840
 Catch up 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:27.370
 It is located below one can rest a block of statements tide of surrounding obstacles 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:30.489
 Because it is difficult to grasp 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:33.220
 So do it. 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:40.930
 If you sell the signal 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:44.470
 There is no fault at all, so to move safely without an accident 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:47.340
 9 of the guide staff and the driver giving the signal 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:47.340
 Most important 

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:57.370
 won 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:58.360
 Once all of the crew blocks have been moved, workers can reach up to 1200 poles. 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:04.030
 Possible 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:07.840
 By using the polyac crane to start assembling the blocks, 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:12.170
 It finally begins to shape the ship. 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:17.180
 The work done in the dock is also done in the dragon 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:19.430
 The higher the height of the hull, the higher the height of the hull 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:21.859
 I have no choice but to 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:27.320
 The largest 35 Mito 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:32.150
 A pair of work that needs to touch the castle elsewhere on the 7th floor of the apartment 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:35.389
 Workers climb up the equipment, called sogae, 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:42.260
 When to Finish 

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:43.550
 Law-ah now look up the struggle now is to be more highly of him 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:46.610
 Adaptation 4 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:52.690
 I see some cliffs on fireballs. 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:52.690
 Anyone feeling comes to decay but found two days magnetic undertaken up 

00:04:52.879 --> 00:05:04.819
 Until the very tall ship that will be built is completed. 

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:08.689
 Tough job functions require one and a half years is a long time, it is still time 

00:05:04.819 --> 00:05:12.710
 There are workers who have to do the welding at risk. 

00:05:08.689 --> 00:05:14.880
 Every time the current ship is completed, a greater sense of responsibility for welding technology development 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:18.930
 Feel 

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:23.480
 Until now, more convenient and perfect welding technology 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:23.480
 Technology development of the functional person will continue in the future 

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:32.440
 Only then corruption is the responsibility of the faster gotta other operating expenses in some cases by 

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:35.620
 And safely 

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:39.880
 I have such a dream to fly 

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:43.690
 One step higher than it is now high-level 

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:46.420
 Any welding technique or automatic development to do 

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:52.890
 What work palace 

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:52.890
 Considering these things, I will be doing my best to develop. 

00:05:53.380 --> 00:06:00.190
 No matter what you know , no matter what you realize, 

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:04.570
 It has no meaning. 

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:08.080
 Creating a better future, not just a lot of loose yourself in the situation of 

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:11.880
 Yoo Young-guk, who constantly strives for 

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:11.880
 He was holding his winning challenges 

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:16.820
 U 

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:21.610

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:31.940
 won 

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:40.010
