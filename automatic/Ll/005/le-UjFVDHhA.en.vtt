does wonderful stuff now you came up
with<00:00:25.650> a<00:00:25.769> concept<00:00:25.980> where<00:00:26.670> you<00:00:26.789> probably<00:00:26.939> just

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
with a concept where you probably just

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:28.550 
with a concept where you probably just
sword<00:00:27.359> in<00:00:27.420> the<00:00:27.480> background<00:00:27.869> there<00:00:28.050> you<00:00:28.439> can

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
sword in the background there you can

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.919 
sword in the background there you can
actually<00:00:28.740> place<00:00:29.250> sticky<00:00:29.970> bombs<00:00:30.210> all<00:00:30.599> over<00:00:30.630> the

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
actually place sticky bombs all over the

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.979 
actually place sticky bombs all over the
place<00:00:31.170> and<00:00:31.410> then<00:00:31.740> detonated<00:00:32.520> by<00:00:32.870> removing<00:00:33.870> and

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
place and then detonated by removing and

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.040 
place and then detonated by removing and
putting<00:00:34.170> back<00:00:34.380> a<00:00:34.559> button<00:00:34.980> in<00:00:35.130> your<00:00:35.610> inventory

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:36.050 
putting back a button in your inventory

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:38.150 
putting back a button in your inventory
okay<00:00:37.050> so<00:00:37.110> I<00:00:37.260> thought<00:00:37.410> what<00:00:37.800> I'm<00:00:37.920> going<00:00:38.129> to

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
okay so I thought what I'm going to

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.819 
okay so I thought what I'm going to
demonstrate<00:00:38.399> what<00:00:39.239> I'm<00:00:39.329> going<00:00:39.540> to<00:00:39.570> do<00:00:39.719> is<00:00:39.989> I'm

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
demonstrate what I'm going to do is I'm

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.799 
demonstrate what I'm going to do is I'm
actually<00:00:41.070> going<00:00:41.370> to<00:00:41.760> try<00:00:42.329> and<00:00:42.450> make<00:00:42.540> it<00:00:42.719> so

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
actually going to try and make it so

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.270 
actually going to try and make it so
that<00:00:42.840> the<00:00:43.050> snowball<00:00:43.320> itself<00:00:43.980> actually

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
that the snowball itself actually

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.700 
that the snowball itself actually
explodes<00:00:45.050> okay<00:00:46.050> so<00:00:46.110> let<00:00:46.260> me<00:00:46.289> just<00:00:46.350> show<00:00:46.680> you

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
explodes okay so let me just show you

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:47.660 
explodes okay so let me just show you
one<00:00:46.890> more<00:00:46.920> time<00:00:47.129> there<00:00:47.309> we<00:00:47.370> go

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
one more time there we go

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.979 
one more time there we go
fantastic<00:00:48.739> alright<00:00:49.739> so<00:00:50.300> this<00:00:51.300> is<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:51.660> basic

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
fantastic alright so this is the basic

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.020 
fantastic alright so this is the basic
concept<00:00:52.170> so<00:00:52.559> if<00:00:52.649> I<00:00:52.710> throw<00:00:52.920> a<00:00:52.949> snowball<00:00:53.160> and

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
concept so if I throw a snowball and

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.600 
concept so if I throw a snowball and
wear<00:00:54.719> it<00:00:54.870> where<00:00:55.199> it<00:00:55.320> lands<00:00:55.620> it<00:00:55.739> will<00:00:55.920> explode

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
wear it where it lands it will explode

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.310 
wear it where it lands it will explode
now<00:00:56.820> if<00:00:57.030> you<00:00:57.149> want<00:00:57.360> it's<00:00:57.750> not<00:00:57.899> actually<00:00:58.199> where

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
now if you want it's not actually where

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.360 
now if you want it's not actually where
it<00:00:58.410> lands<00:00:58.800> it<00:00:59.100> is<00:00:59.399> where<00:00:59.670> the<00:00:59.850> last<00:01:00.090> entity<00:01:00.780> was

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:01.370 
it lands it is where the last entity was

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:04.039 
it lands it is where the last entity was
before<00:01:02.370> it's<00:01:02.670> disappeared<00:01:03.420> so<00:01:03.690> well<00:01:03.960> not

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
before it's disappeared so well not

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:05.690 
before it's disappeared so well not
really<00:01:04.199> that<00:01:04.379> it's<00:01:04.680> where<00:01:04.979> the<00:01:05.070> last<00:01:05.250> entity

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
really that it's where the last entity

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:11.840 
really that it's where the last entity
was<00:01:05.909> within<00:01:06.119> ten<00:01:06.950> few<00:01:07.950> sticks<00:01:08.369> of<00:01:08.430> a<00:01:09.260> TNT<00:01:10.850> prime

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
was within ten few sticks of a TNT prime

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:12.800 
was within ten few sticks of a TNT prime
TNT<00:01:12.240> okay

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
TNT okay

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.200 
TNT okay
so<00:01:13.020> using<00:01:13.979> this<00:01:14.100> method<00:01:14.490> you<00:01:14.520> can<00:01:14.760> see<00:01:14.909> I<00:01:14.939> can

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
so using this method you can see I can

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.780 
so using this method you can see I can
actually<00:01:15.630> as<00:01:16.500> a<00:01:16.560> map<00:01:16.950> maker<00:01:17.189> I<00:01:17.430> don't<00:01:17.670> actually

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
actually as a map maker I don't actually

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.160 
actually as a map maker I don't actually
have<00:01:17.970> to<00:01:18.060> use<00:01:18.299> mcedit

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
have to use mcedit

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.590 
have to use mcedit
or<00:01:19.290> voxel<00:01:20.070> sniper<00:01:20.340> or<00:01:20.610> bucket<00:01:20.970> to<00:01:21.330> kind<00:01:21.540> of

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
or voxel sniper or bucket to kind of

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.280 
or voxel sniper or bucket to kind of
carve<00:01:22.080> out<00:01:23.299> cool-looking<00:01:24.299> terrain<00:01:24.930> and<00:01:25.140> by

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
carve out cool-looking terrain and by

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.160 
carve out cool-looking terrain and by
just<00:01:25.470> fiddling<00:01:25.890> with<00:01:26.040> the<00:01:26.460> fuse<00:01:26.790> length<00:01:27.170> and

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
just fiddling with the fuse length and

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.319 
just fiddling with the fuse length and
the<00:01:28.380> TNT<00:01:28.860> strength<00:01:29.549> I<00:01:29.700> probably<00:01:29.939> do<00:01:30.090> this<00:01:30.240> with

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
the TNT strength I probably do this with

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.060 
the TNT strength I probably do this with
creepers<00:01:30.780> as<00:01:30.930> well<00:01:31.110> to<00:01:31.290> increase<00:01:31.650> the<00:01:32.040> the

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
creepers as well to increase the the

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.260 
creepers as well to increase the the
actual<00:01:33.470> damage<00:01:34.470> range<00:01:34.909> you<00:01:35.909> know<00:01:36.030> you<00:01:36.090> can

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
actual damage range you know you can

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.569 
actual damage range you know you can
actually<00:01:36.540> now<00:01:36.659> just<00:01:37.200> a<00:01:37.380> within<00:01:37.829> seconds<00:01:38.460> as

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
actually now just a within seconds as

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.370 
actually now just a within seconds as
you<00:01:38.700> can<00:01:38.850> see<00:01:39.030> I've<00:01:39.180> actually<00:01:39.420> carved<00:01:40.259> that

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
you can see I've actually carved that

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.499 
you can see I've actually carved that
and<00:01:40.619> obviously<00:01:40.770> I<00:01:41.040> need<00:01:41.400> to<00:01:41.430> smooth<00:01:41.970> over<00:01:42.180> some

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
and obviously I need to smooth over some

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.030 
and obviously I need to smooth over some
of<00:01:42.630> this<00:01:42.689> i've<00:01:42.899> actually<00:01:43.320> carved<00:01:43.710> out<00:01:43.829> a

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
of this i've actually carved out a

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:49.910 
of this i've actually carved out a
pretty<00:01:44.700> decent<00:01:45.689> looking<00:01:47.540> like<00:01:48.540> valley<00:01:49.530> with

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
pretty decent looking like valley with

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.580 
pretty decent looking like valley with
hidden<00:01:50.659> chambers<00:01:51.659> and<00:01:51.810> things<00:01:52.020> okay<00:01:52.320> so<00:01:52.350> this

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
hidden chambers and things okay so this

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.499 
hidden chambers and things okay so this
is<00:01:52.680> phenomenal<00:01:52.950> that<00:01:53.430> only<00:01:53.700> is<00:01:53.970> good<00:01:54.149> for<00:01:54.360> map

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
is phenomenal that only is good for map

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.179 
is phenomenal that only is good for map
makers<00:01:54.840> do<00:01:55.020> when<00:01:55.229> you're<00:01:55.350> making<00:01:55.560> maps<00:01:55.920> but

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
makers do when you're making maps but

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:59.899 
makers do when you're making maps but
obviously<00:01:56.820> this<00:01:56.909> can<00:01:57.149> very<00:01:57.570> very<00:01:58.610> make<00:01:59.610> things

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
obviously this can very very make things

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.569 
obviously this can very very make things
much<00:02:00.119> more<00:02:00.360> exciting<00:02:01.020> in<00:02:01.200> pvp<00:02:01.799> maps<00:02:01.979> so<00:02:02.430> you

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
much more exciting in pvp maps so you

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.219 
much more exciting in pvp maps so you
know<00:02:02.820> you<00:02:02.880> can<00:02:03.090> kind<00:02:03.329> of<00:02:03.450> try<00:02:03.899> and<00:02:03.930> kill<00:02:04.200> each

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
know you can kind of try and kill each

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.459 
know you can kind of try and kill each
other<00:02:04.469> with<00:02:04.710> snowballs<00:02:05.640> and<00:02:05.939> and<00:02:06.750> so<00:02:06.930> forth<00:02:07.170> so

let me well let me should we show you
what<00:02:10.550> what<00:02:11.550> our<00:02:11.940> works<00:02:12.390> now<00:02:12.660> as<00:02:12.810> i<00:02:12.900> said<00:02:12.930> this

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
what what our works now as i said this

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.820 
what what our works now as i said this
is

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
is

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.510 
is
based<00:02:14.370> on<00:02:14.550> a<00:02:14.610> concept<00:02:15.000> by<00:02:15.240> Ruby<00:02:16.080> so<00:02:16.680> first<00:02:17.400> of

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
based on a concept by Ruby so first of

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.290 
based on a concept by Ruby so first of
all<00:02:17.610> I<00:02:17.820> have<00:02:18.060> a<00:02:18.590> command<00:02:19.590> block<00:02:19.940> code<00:02:20.940> running

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
all I have a command block code running

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.390 
all I have a command block code running
here<00:02:21.720> okay<00:02:22.320> which<00:02:22.500> sets<00:02:22.830> a<00:02:22.950> redstone<00:02:23.280> block

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
here okay which sets a redstone block

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.970 
here okay which sets a redstone block
over<00:02:23.880> here<00:02:23.910> and<00:02:24.300> then<00:02:24.390> I<00:02:24.480> have<00:02:24.510> a<00:02:24.980> command

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
over here and then I have a command

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.860 
over here and then I have a command
block<00:02:26.100> over<00:02:26.400> here<00:02:26.550> that<00:02:26.700> sets<00:02:27.000> that<00:02:27.240> block<00:02:27.570> to

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
block over here that sets that block to

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.720 
block over here that sets that block to
air<00:02:28.080> so<00:02:28.530> the<00:02:28.620> moment<00:02:28.800> that<00:02:28.920> the<00:02:29.250> redstone

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
air so the moment that the redstone

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.720 
air so the moment that the redstone
block<00:02:29.910> spawned<00:02:30.240> it'll<00:02:30.840> it'll<00:02:31.260> this<00:02:31.590> it'll<00:02:32.010> be

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
block spawned it'll it'll this it'll be

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.910 
block spawned it'll it'll this it'll be
spawn<00:02:33.090> again<00:02:33.750> because<00:02:34.350> of<00:02:34.380> this<00:02:34.560> block<00:02:34.800> over

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
spawn again because of this block over

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.730 
spawn again because of this block over
here<00:02:35.040> which<00:02:35.910> creates<00:02:36.390> this<00:02:36.780> clock<00:02:37.320> now<00:02:37.560> just

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:37.740 
here which creates this clock now just

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:39.220 
here which creates this clock now just
to<00:02:37.830> show<00:02:37.980> you<00:02:38.040> that<00:02:38.070> there<00:02:38.340> is<00:02:38.370> a<00:02:38.520> clock<00:02:38.880> here

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 
to show you that there is a clock here

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:41.870 
to show you that there is a clock here
okay<00:02:40.230> there<00:02:40.560> it<00:02:40.680> is<00:02:40.770> so<00:02:41.100> this<00:02:41.280> is<00:02:41.430> a<00:02:41.490> clock

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
okay there it is so this is a clock

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:43.550 
okay there it is so this is a clock
there<00:02:42.120> is<00:02:42.240> a<00:02:42.270> clock<00:02:42.510> running<00:02:42.810> a<00:02:42.930> very<00:02:43.290> very

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
there is a clock running a very very

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.430 
there is a clock running a very very
fast<00:02:43.830> clock<00:02:44.130> now<00:02:45.000> what<00:02:45.870> that<00:02:45.900> means<00:02:46.230> that

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
fast clock now what that means that

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.530 
fast clock now what that means that
these<00:02:46.620> two<00:02:46.680> blocks<00:02:47.460> constantly<00:02:48.270> get<00:02:48.450> an

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
these two blocks constantly get an

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.720 
these two blocks constantly get an
update<00:02:48.930> right<00:02:49.470> so<00:02:49.950> what<00:02:50.130> this<00:02:50.280> block<00:02:50.490> over

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
update right so what this block over

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.820 
update right so what this block over
here<00:02:50.760> does<00:02:51.090> it<00:02:51.300> tests<00:02:51.750> to<00:02:51.870> see<00:02:52.080> if<00:02:52.110> there<00:02:52.500> is<00:02:52.680> a

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
here does it tests to see if there is a

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:54.890 
here does it tests to see if there is a
snowball<00:02:53.520> in<00:02:53.730> the<00:02:53.970> world<00:02:54.150> so<00:02:54.480> if<00:02:54.600> there's<00:02:54.780> a

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
snowball in the world so if there's a

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.630 
snowball in the world so if there's a
snowball<00:02:55.230> in<00:02:55.320> the<00:02:55.410> world<00:02:55.620> you<00:02:56.100> will<00:02:56.220> see<00:02:56.280> that

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
snowball in the world you will see that

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.200 
snowball in the world you will see that
that<00:02:58.520> comparator<00:02:59.520> which<00:02:59.640> I<00:02:59.760> now<00:02:59.940> just

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:00.210 
that comparator which I now just

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:02.330 
that comparator which I now just
destroyed<00:03:00.600> that<00:03:01.020> comparator<00:03:01.590> will<00:03:01.860> actually

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
destroyed that comparator will actually

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.030 
destroyed that comparator will actually
go<00:03:02.490> on<00:03:03.140> against<00:03:04.140> you<00:03:04.230> which<00:03:04.350> puts<00:03:04.560> compare<00:03:04.890> the

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
go on against you which puts compare the

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:05.990 
go on against you which puts compare the
back<00:03:05.160> so<00:03:05.310> I'm<00:03:05.370> going<00:03:05.490> to<00:03:05.520> show<00:03:05.610> you<00:03:05.700> guys

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
back so I'm going to show you guys

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.910 
back so I'm going to show you guys
so<00:03:06.270> that<00:03:06.390> comparator<00:03:07.110> will<00:03:07.230> go<00:03:07.350> on<00:03:07.500> powering

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
so that comparator will go on powering

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:09.440 
so that comparator will go on powering
this<00:03:08.040> come<00:03:08.220> on<00:03:08.340> block<00:03:08.550> this<00:03:08.880> come<00:03:09.120> on<00:03:09.240> block

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
this come on block this come on block

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:13.400 
this come on block this come on block
summons<00:03:10.020> Prime<00:03:10.410> team<00:03:10.710> T<00:03:11.250> with<00:03:12.030> a<00:03:12.060> fuse<00:03:12.480> of<00:03:12.690> ten

summons Prime team T with a fuse of ten

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:15.590 
summons Prime team T with a fuse of ten
okay<00:03:13.830> now<00:03:14.220> I'm<00:03:14.580> summing<00:03:14.880> in<00:03:15.000> it<00:03:15.090> somewhere<00:03:15.270> up

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:15.600 
okay now I'm summing in it somewhere up

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:20.080 
okay now I'm summing in it somewhere up
there<00:03:15.960> so<00:03:16.290> if<00:03:16.380> I<00:03:16.560> throw<00:03:17.250> a<00:03:17.280> snowball<00:03:17.959> update

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090 
there so if I throw a snowball update

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:23.360 
there so if I throw a snowball update
where's<00:03:21.090> you<00:03:21.330> can<00:03:21.450> very<00:03:22.350> briefly<00:03:22.830> see<00:03:23.250> it

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
where's you can very briefly see it

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.760 
where's you can very briefly see it
sometimes<00:03:23.820> and<00:03:24.480> now<00:03:24.600> you<00:03:24.660> can't<00:03:24.989> again<00:03:25.410> but

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:25.770 
sometimes and now you can't again but

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:27.860 
sometimes and now you can't again but
anyway<00:03:25.980> it<00:03:26.190> sums<00:03:26.640> it<00:03:26.790> summons<00:03:27.270> it<00:03:27.390> up<00:03:27.570> there

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
anyway it sums it summons it up there

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:30.620 
anyway it sums it summons it up there
all<00:03:28.709> right<00:03:28.860> so<00:03:29.070> it<00:03:29.400> detects<00:03:30.120> the<00:03:30.239> snowball

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630 
all right so it detects the snowball

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:32.870 
all right so it detects the snowball
summons<00:03:31.260> the<00:03:31.380> print<00:03:31.650> in<00:03:31.830> T<00:03:32.130> with<00:03:32.340> a<00:03:32.370> fuse<00:03:32.730> of

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 
summons the print in T with a fuse of

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.090 
summons the print in T with a fuse of
ten<00:03:33.120> and<00:03:33.270> then<00:03:33.660> this<00:03:33.900> come<00:03:34.410> on<00:03:34.500> block<00:03:34.739> over

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:35.100 
ten and then this come on block over

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:37.930 
ten and then this come on block over
here<00:03:35.209> constantly<00:03:36.209> tries<00:03:36.630> to<00:03:36.989> teleport<00:03:37.350> an

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:37.940 
here constantly tries to teleport an

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:41.900 
here constantly tries to teleport an
entity<00:03:38.940> prime<00:03:39.390> T<00:03:39.660> and<00:03:39.780> T<00:03:39.900> C<00:03:40.770> equals<00:03:41.340> minus<00:03:41.730> one

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:41.910 
entity prime T and T C equals minus one

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:43.490 
entity prime T and T C equals minus one
now<00:03:42.060> this<00:03:42.300> is<00:03:42.510> what<00:03:42.750> I<00:03:42.930> actually<00:03:43.170> saw<00:03:43.470> on

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
now this is what I actually saw on

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:46.070 
now this is what I actually saw on
Ruby's<00:03:44.040> concept<00:03:44.550> that<00:03:44.640> I<00:03:44.700> wasn't<00:03:45.060> aware<00:03:45.420> of<00:03:45.480> C

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:46.080 
Ruby's concept that I wasn't aware of C

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:49.160 
Ruby's concept that I wasn't aware of C
minus<00:03:46.350> one<00:03:46.650> means<00:03:46.890> the<00:03:47.130> youngest<00:03:47.910> entity<00:03:48.510> so

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:49.170 
minus one means the youngest entity so

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:53.030 
minus one means the youngest entity so
it's<00:03:49.320> the<00:03:49.500> latest<00:03:49.800> spawned<00:03:51.590> TNT<00:03:52.590> it<00:03:52.800> will

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 
it's the latest spawned TNT it will

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.300 
it's the latest spawned TNT it will
actually<00:03:53.520> then<00:03:53.550> summon<00:03:54.510> to<00:03:54.810> you<00:03:55.050> okay<00:03:55.709> and

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
actually then summon to you okay and

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:58.040 
actually then summon to you okay and
then<00:03:56.790> the<00:03:56.880> next<00:03:57.150> thing<00:03:57.239> it<00:03:57.360> does<00:03:57.480> it<00:03:57.630> summons

00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:58.050 
then the next thing it does it summons

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:01.790 
then the next thing it does it summons
it<00:03:58.170> to<00:03:58.470> the<00:03:58.680> youngest<00:03:59.330> snowball<00:04:00.330> right<00:04:01.170> you

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:01.800 
it to the youngest snowball right you

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:04.580 
it to the youngest snowball right you
can<00:04:01.950> probably<00:04:02.310> remove<00:04:02.880> that<00:04:03.060> in<00:04:03.480> any<00:04:03.930> way<00:04:04.260> but

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
can probably remove that in any way but

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:06.500 
can probably remove that in any way but
you<00:04:04.800> do<00:04:05.070> have<00:04:05.280> the<00:04:05.400> danger<00:04:05.910> then<00:04:06.060> of<00:04:06.300> if

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 
you do have the danger then of if

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:07.910 
you do have the danger then of if
somebody<00:04:06.870> somewhere<00:04:07.200> on<00:04:07.320> the<00:04:07.470> world<00:04:07.680> actually

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:07.920 
somebody somewhere on the world actually

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:11.030 
somebody somewhere on the world actually
ignites<00:04:08.910> TNT<00:04:09.450> to<00:04:09.930> actually<00:04:10.200> steal<00:04:10.500> steal

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040 
ignites TNT to actually steal steal

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:14.930 
ignites TNT to actually steal steal
their<00:04:11.519> TNT<00:04:12.000> from<00:04:12.330> them<00:04:12.570> had<00:04:13.320> to<00:04:13.530> use<00:04:14.100> in<00:04:14.370> your

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:14.940 
their TNT from them had to use in your

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:16.880 
their TNT from them had to use in your
snowball<00:04:15.570> exploding<00:04:16.049> snowball<00:04:16.380> but<00:04:16.680> that's

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:16.890 
snowball exploding snowball but that's

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:20.240 
snowball exploding snowball but that's
that's<00:04:17.340> it<00:04:17.730> I<00:04:18.060> mean<00:04:18.299> this<00:04:18.480> is<00:04:18.660> this<00:04:18.989> is<00:04:19.070> quite<00:04:20.070> a

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.250 
that's it I mean this is this is quite a

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:22.460 
that's it I mean this is this is quite a
very<00:04:20.580> pretty<00:04:20.910> simple<00:04:21.359> and<00:04:21.510> basic<00:04:21.870> concept<00:04:22.289> and

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:22.470 
very pretty simple and basic concept and

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:27.000 
very pretty simple and basic concept and
if<00:04:22.650> you<00:04:22.740> watched<00:04:22.950> my<00:04:23.120> other<00:04:24.560> teepee

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:27.010 
if you watched my other teepee

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:29.970 
if you watched my other teepee
entities<00:04:27.700> videos<00:04:28.150> you<00:04:28.360> would<00:04:28.480> see<00:04:28.750> that<00:04:29.680> yeah

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:29.980 
entities videos you would see that yeah

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:31.710 
entities videos you would see that yeah
this<00:04:30.160> is<00:04:30.280> great<00:04:30.430> you<00:04:30.670> should<00:04:30.700> also<00:04:31.090> be<00:04:31.330> able<00:04:31.360> to

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:31.720 
this is great you should also be able to

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:34.680 
this is great you should also be able to
actually<00:04:32.130> summon<00:04:33.130> a<00:04:33.220> prime<00:04:33.490> tt<00:04:33.940> with<00:04:34.180> a<00:04:34.330> name

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:34.690 
actually summon a prime tt with a name

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:37.680 
actually summon a prime tt with a name
and<00:04:35.590> a<00:04:35.770> snowball<00:04:36.250> with<00:04:36.730> an<00:04:36.910> ambush<00:04:37.240> actually

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:37.690 
and a snowball with an ambush actually

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:39.300 
and a snowball with an ambush actually
don't<00:04:37.930> doesn't<00:04:38.380> work<00:04:38.650> I<00:04:38.830> tried<00:04:39.040> that<00:04:39.160> before

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:39.310 
don't doesn't work I tried that before

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:40.650 
don't doesn't work I tried that before
you<00:04:39.550> can't<00:04:39.730> actually<00:04:39.850> summon<00:04:40.240> a<00:04:40.270> snowball

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:40.660 
you can't actually summon a snowball

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:42.990 
you can't actually summon a snowball
with<00:04:40.810> a<00:04:41.050> name<00:04:41.620> it's<00:04:41.860> I<00:04:42.220> think<00:04:42.280> the<00:04:42.430> data<00:04:42.700> gets

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:43.000 
with a name it's I think the data gets

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.600 
with a name it's I think the data gets
changed<00:04:43.300> once<00:04:43.630> you<00:04:43.810> throw<00:04:44.050> it<00:04:44.230> okay<00:04:44.770> but<00:04:45.250> you

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:45.610 
changed once you throw it okay but you

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:47.100 
changed once you throw it okay but you
can<00:04:45.730> actually<00:04:45.820> summon<00:04:46.210> the<00:04:46.270> prime<00:04:46.540> TT<00:04:46.930> with

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:47.110 
can actually summon the prime TT with

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:48.510 
can actually summon the prime TT with
the<00:04:47.170> name<00:04:47.320> so<00:04:47.470> you<00:04:47.530> probably<00:04:47.860> don't<00:04:48.070> need<00:04:48.280> the

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:48.520 
the name so you probably don't need the

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:52.650 
the name so you probably don't need the
youngest<00:04:49.330> T<00:04:49.480> and<00:04:49.600> T<00:04:49.750> 1<00:04:50.400> and<00:04:51.400> then<00:04:51.940> yeah<00:04:52.240> this<00:04:52.540> is

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:52.660 
youngest T and T 1 and then yeah this is

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:54.960 
youngest T and T 1 and then yeah this is
a<00:04:52.690> great<00:04:53.170> great<00:04:53.440> great<00:04:53.560> great<00:04:53.860> great<00:04:54.130> concept

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:54.970 
a great great great great great concept
