00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:15.000
 d 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:21.010
 good to all welcome I bring a 

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:21.010
 tutorial 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:29.619
 you liked it, just subscribe and 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:30.939
 like good over here I do not know what they're for 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:34.500
 that is light is believer opens with the 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:34.500
 pedal 8 is the crank 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:42.090
 you have to toast with the pedal 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:45.210
 you have in front I advise you to choose 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:47.370
 one side of the pedal since the pins are 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.530
 what they do to make you respect with 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.260
 the band are going to wear you out 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:55.590
 and get to a point that if you do not leave a 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.300
 face to use it always because you are going to 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:01.860
 have both laughs and stop to slide 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:03.750
 if not the good foot first 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:06.350
 you want to know how to give a little in general 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:10.980
 because it's not that it's very easy to 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:14.840
 start once you are going to do what 

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:18.950
 that is asked the written think so 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:21.369
 to know a little more than 180 eyes and to 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:21.369
 opposite side 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:30.369
 what to do 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:33.790
 sometimes dedication 190 70 degrees 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:33.790
 to nail the 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:38.620
 old 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:41.650
 when you do in the jump you have to support 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:43.600
 all the weight on the line try to make 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:45.840
 force with arms up for 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:50.960
 that the bike does not fall 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.960
 and to put on the pedal 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:57.780
 once 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.860
 you are stuck, what you must do is 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:03.580
 try to hold with arms 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:06.610
 doing strength and you have to do about 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:08.460
 all the support of the weight in that 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:10.840
 pedal 

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:13.230
 what really matters most is making 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.230
 force 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:18.860
 once they had lost doing that 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:22.010
 It will cost us a lot 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:25.129
 good to keep it 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:27.350
 I have done the body a little towards 

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:30.110
 back be 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:33.260
 if you stay straight really for the 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:35.170
 inertia then it will be forward 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:39.890
 or are you going to slow down, what I do is 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:42.260
 to lean a tad a tad towards 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:45.530
 back but very little I advise you and 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:49.880
 fast when good to keep us 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:51.620
 to learn it very slowly that yes that 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:54.640
 you learn to nail and hold the weight and 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:57.160
 then you can go fast 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:59.170
 and good and to leave you can leave 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.560
 carry or you can do as a minivan and 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:02.110
 since 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:05.900
 ie the pedal 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:09.110
 Do strength from the pedal and jump 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:11.750
 good and another advice that in forgotten is 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:15.349
 that tells railings to be what 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:16.790
 which is if they are too low so 

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:19.250
 are for desk we will leave 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:20.810
 because even if it misplaced the 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:22.410
 wheels are going to touch the ground and you are not going to 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:24.870
 power 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:27.780
 and well that has been all any doubt 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:30.540
 that you have leave me the comments in 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:31.950
