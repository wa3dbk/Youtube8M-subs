 Hey, people, beauty. 

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:27.400
 I'll talk a little about one of the plants. 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:29.950
 here in my region 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:31.660
 this plant that a few years ago and already 

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:34.690
 you must know, right? 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:36.640
 but for those who do not know this plant that is 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:40.120
 call of carqueja 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:42.519
 She is a plant that I can not mistake 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:46.089
 found a number of regions 

00:00:42.519 --> 00:00:49.690
 here in Brazil , it's still very easy 

00:00:46.089 --> 00:00:52.199
 find here in my area is this 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:52.199
 plant 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:01:02.290
 she has a very peculiar trait she does not have 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:05.920
 How do you not know her to the leaf she 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:06.940
 follows the entire length of the stem or can 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:10.900
 see here 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:13.600
 she follows the stem and goes upstairs is 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:18.610
 The only plant I know is that you have this 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:23.860
 format is a very last plant 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:26.079
 survivor type wti and anyone 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:28.359
 who likes to enjoy nature if you have 

00:01:26.079 --> 00:01:31.539
 I do not kill and start to feel pain 

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:34.119
 stomach a bad feeling is referent 

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:35.200
 to the liver stomach that plant that is 

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:37.060
 very good 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:42.700
 you can eat it straight is not 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:45.249
 chew or make a leaf tea 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.929
 I like it very bitter and I'm not going 

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:47.770
 take the test and now that I do not like it 

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:51.789
 I like bitter 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:54.149
 So whoever you have there in the woods needs 

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:57.189
 of a remedy for the stomach 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:02:02.259
