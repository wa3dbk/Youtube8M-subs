00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.640
W roku 2009 odbyły się pierwsze otwarte Mistrzostwa Czech.

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:17.780
Na tak niewielkie zawody przyjechało około 30 graczy z zagranicy

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:22.400
I wtedy stwierdziliśmy, może by tak zorganizować zawody międzynarodowe?

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.200

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.100
Łukasz Chwieduk, 21 years old.

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:38.640
We came here to Superball - World Open Freestyle Football Championships

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.480
The tournament also works as qualifications to the Red Bull Street Style World Finals.

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.620
My name is Michał Rycaj, I’m 24 now.

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:52.120
I come from a small town near Zamość – Jarosławiec

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.560
I’ve been practicing freestyle for almost 9 years now.

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:58.360
Hi, I’m Szymon Skalski – Szymo.

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:04.860
I’ve been into freestyle since 2005. The exact date is 20 May 2005, so it’s over 9 years now.

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:08.700
I live in a small town near Olkusz – Zarzecze.

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.280
Tego roku mamy 236 zawodników,

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:25.840
a właściwie osób związanych z freestyle football, ludzi dla których ten sport jest pasją.

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:31.320
Freestyle bardzo dynamicznie się rozwija,

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:38.080
a ja jestem niezwykle dumny i szczęśliwy z tego, że mam swój udział w tworzeniu wspaniałych momentów w życiu freestylerów.

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.240

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.500
So far, I’ve stood on the podium about 30 times.

00:01:53.640 --> 00:02:00.240
My most important freestyle achievements are winning Red Bull Street Style 2013 World Finals in Tokyo.

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.300
I’ve won European Championships two times.

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:09.600
Winning World Championships organized by F3 Federation – F3 World Tour.

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:13.480
For sure, it’s highly prestigious to win this tournament.

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:18.340
It’s about prestige among freestylers - everybody knows about this event, loads of people come here every year.

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:23.920
This year, the number of players may be the highest in the history of Superball – there are people from Mexico, Brazil

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:28.180
people from virtually all around Europe. It’s a cherry-on-top kind of event.

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:35.980
We hope to be on the podium, or at least we hope that 1 or 2 Polish freestylers will either win or take the 2nd or 3rd place.

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:40.040
Group battles take place here, on the running track of the stadium.

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:46.780
The stage is set and the whole thing looks pretty nice. There is also a grandstand where you can sit and watch.

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:06.100
Currently, the qualification round takes place, which involves battles between four freestylers.

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:11.920
Each player has got 30-second sets and each of them has 3 sets during the whole battle,

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:13.760
which makes these battles last exactly 6 minutes.

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:32.700
In my humble opinion, the favourite of this tournament is Michryc

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:42.100
Mikołaj, z Polski, a drugie miejsce – myślę, że Luki. I Michryc na trzecim miejscu.

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:43.700
Michryc, Mikołaj

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:45.027
Jestem za Pedrinho

00:03:45.027 --> 00:03:46.180
Szymo wydaje się bardzo mocny

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:46.680

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:50.220
Szymek, Mikołaj, Łukasz, Tobias, Gunther

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:51.760
Szymo, Mikołaj

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:55.640
Michryc, Szymo, Luki

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:57.960
Michryc? Michryc.

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:01.160
Michryc, Szymo, or Mikołaj.

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:04.420
Also Memo – I believe he may be in the final.

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:11.000
If I’m not mistaken, there are 5 or 6 Polish players in the top 16, so it’s a good achievement.

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:17.900
The best 16 players will battle against one another to win the title of the Open World Champion.

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:25.180
In the first battle, I compete against the dark horse of this tournament – Erlend from Norway.

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.440
I would be stupid if I disregarded my opponent,

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:35.620
because I really need to put a lot of effort to beat this player.

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:40.440
Of course I have the natural kind of stress, just like every freestyler before an important tournament.

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:44.060
Here you are – these are tricks which I can potentially use.

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:48.420
It’s incredibly important to do something like this, as there are so many tricks that it’s impossible to remember all of them.

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:53.140
If I beat Erlend, the next battle will probably be against Szymek.

00:04:53.180 --> 00:05:00.680
If I lose, I can wave goodbye to Redbull which, I must admit, is my dream and my goal for this year.

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:05.240
That’s why when it comes to battling against Szymek, I just have to do my very best.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.200
Thankfully, I won the battle and it’s a huge reason to be proud to me.

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:38.160
I mean, really huge because Szymek is just such an extraordinary person who stands out from the average by 100 000 000 000 light years.

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:41.540
Then, I battled against Pedrinho.

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:07.520
I don’t remember much from this battle. I know I lost,

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:10.580
I’ve heard different opinions about the judges’ decision.

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:14.260
So far, I won’t present my view on that, as I remember nothing and I haven’t seen the battle yet.

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:21.060
I didn’t want to keep that thought in my mind. I focused on the battle for the 3rd place,

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:24.900
And there’s a battle against Paweł Skóra, which was actually a fight for the ticket to Brazil.

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:27.840
In other words, at stake was the Redbull Street Style World Finals.

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:32.360
I did a good job, it was a really good battle and everything went smoothly.

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:35.920
I won by unanimous decision

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:40.140
and I won the ticket to Brazil, so I achieved my goal

00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:42.017
I aimed at being in the top 3 of the tournament.

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:45.580
Of course I wanted to win, but you don’t always win and you just have to accept it.
