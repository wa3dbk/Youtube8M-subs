00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.000
 Welcome to this week 

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:23.890
 news tri cup yes almost would not be 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.380
 come because it's just not new 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:28.029
 news regarding geograf to this one 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:30.310
 Thursday there was finally something 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:33.070
 which also makes a small video 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:34.120
 could and yes i was worth that 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:35.530
 about the tourism but 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:37.059
 instead, maybe somehow like that 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:38.350
 a raid video think here oberhausen 

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:39.489
 cards but this time I have to 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:41.980
 actually do not do it 

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:43.000
 there will be new news under 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:45.850
 other things, we now know the name 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.780
 the third act that will be the secret of 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:48.540
 its evolution 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:51.159
 I hope that behind this concept 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:52.900
 maybe ritual pendele monsters or 

00:00:51.159 --> 00:00:54.220
 I hate something like that so I hope so 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.390
 a little innovation in the mechanics 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:57.879
 then come in after that 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:59.739
 commute monsters and effect monster 

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:01.150
 commuted monsters had because these are 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:02.650
 also in maine deck and they have relative 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:03.820
 little support long time I get 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:06.310
 hope there is somehow the them 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:08.020
 direction and I'm curious what 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:09.640
 then come in this set and 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:11.799
 hopefully this set gets its name 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:14.409
 this time in contrast to next 

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:15.939
 challengers and the suffering continues 

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:17.860
 there is new information regarding the 

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:19.540
 classy night box come out november 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:21.999
 konami now has a new spell 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:23.530
 card introduced you enter chapter 

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:26.140
 there is not yet a picture but that 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.460
 effect has been reviews and the 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:29.829
 is very interesting that is a kind 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:32.409
 incarnation for the deck in which with the 

00:01:29.829 --> 00:01:35.350
 you have a monster noble night 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:37.390
 monster and a classy at the scripture cards 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:38.590
 can access both simultaneously 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:40.299
 special cologne or 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:42.219
 the special and therefore the equipment 

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:44.319
 equip the card so that if the 

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:45.939
 play somehow of time warner with ranger 

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:47.560
 so just can go on for that 

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:48.700
 but is not quite the searcher to 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.619
 but they probably will 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.969
 then the merlin will be determined 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:53.319
 I hope that he will be like that 

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:55.270
 will work like a kind 

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:56.950
 stratos on the tame maybe noble 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:58.479
 night seeks so it is not to rehearse 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.770
 that they have instantly combo 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:01.359
 rather have to wait for it but 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:02.499
 ever the noble night in the hand 

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:03.819
 so that they have the next valley which 

00:02:02.499 --> 00:02:05.859
 I'm curious how 

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:06.789
 in this case then the final effect 

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:08.259
 from berlin 

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:09.729
 besides, the next one is Japanese 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:12.640
 manga promo has been published there 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:13.780
 will number 23 lancelot ghostwriter on 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.850
 the other world it is one 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.530
 character xs monster of the two 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:19.860
 materials needs a lot more interesting 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:22.720
 Effect is it such a mix out 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:24.730
 Watts and light and darkness wear when 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:27.200
 By the way, the card attacks you 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:28.400
 directly attack 6 israel has 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.750
 and man's battle the opponent 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.129
 she can add an open monster 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:33.349
 choose that the opponent controls and 

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:35.060
 destroy and the second effect is from 

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:36.769
 which she herself is at ease 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:39.739
 own effects is like leading thanks 

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:42.379
 as soon as an effect can be activated 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:43.700
 you have nature and you have to go to all 

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:45.050
 her so it will probably 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.690
 so give a similar ruin that 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:49.190
 monster chain is and yes what I am 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:50.209
 think my job did not even want that 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:51.260
 such a bad idea because the 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:52.790
 build an attacker 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.319
 that is not an effect that is one 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:55.730
 built special incantations therefore 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:56.690
 It will not analyze that and I think 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:58.700
 that can be quite interesting 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:59.660
 map in the future will see if 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.150
 maybe she's with us 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:04.310
 comes out last I have something for 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:05.900
 the complete game from among us number 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:08.090
 106 is history now we have one 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:09.079
 new messiah price card the essentials 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:10.489
 sky dragon 

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:12.200
 this is a synchronous 

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:14.810
 Level 10 which is a bit puzzling 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:17.810
 because the last price cards were yes 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:19.190
 always xs monster and we already have one 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:21.440
 bit of oblivion advised 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:23.150
 Apparently, konami wants to come back 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:25.940
 push a bit and is very nice that 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:27.170
 now have new items 0.26 price map 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:28.670
 and the effect is not even that way 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:31.310
 bad when you call ingo 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:32.630
 is invoked receives the card 800 pts 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:33.920
 in the hand and that stays that way 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:36.139
 not like at tradoria where that is 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:38.900
 changes and can hold with relatively little 

00:03:36.139 --> 00:03:39.980
 cards also have very high ateka 2011 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:41.299
 is not that bad 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:42.410
 and if it is destroyed by 

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:44.480
 the opponent either through fight or 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:45.920
 by card effect and all synchro 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:47.870
 materials to grace and can you 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:49.639
 back again special after that yes 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:51.350
 Again, an engine sky train is too 

00:03:49.639 --> 00:03:53.090
 or maybe the one by the one 

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:54.709
 but not so bad so that 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:56.569
 were the news for this week after all 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:58.010
 something i hope you liked it 

00:03:56.569 --> 00:04:01.540
 See you next week at the 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:01.540
 next news bye bye
