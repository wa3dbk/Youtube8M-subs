00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.150 
think it's quite a good thing to go up
there<00:03:33.360> and<00:03:33.570> try<00:03:33.750> to<00:03:33.780> pick<00:03:34.470> off<00:03:34.650> as<00:03:34.800> many<00:03:34.950> of

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.160 
there and try to pick off as many of

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.070 
there and try to pick off as many of
their<00:03:35.280> tanks<00:03:35.550> as<00:03:35.760> possible<00:03:36.269> especially<00:03:36.450> since

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:37.080 
their tanks as possible especially since

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:38.690 
their tanks as possible especially since
we<00:03:37.200> can<00:03:37.380> get<00:03:37.500> up<00:03:37.620> and<00:03:38.010> shoot<00:03:38.310> him<00:03:38.459> in<00:03:38.519> the<00:03:38.640> back

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
we can get up and shoot him in the back

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:40.940 
we can get up and shoot him in the back
so<00:03:39.390> first<00:03:39.630> thing<00:03:39.870> we<00:03:40.110> say<00:03:40.290> okay<00:03:40.620> let's<00:03:40.830> focus

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
so first thing we say okay let's focus

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:43.729 
so first thing we say okay let's focus
fire<00:03:41.370> the<00:03:41.580> tank<00:03:41.790> destroyer<00:03:42.150> robust<00:03:43.110> puts<00:03:43.410> one

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:43.739 
fire the tank destroyer robust puts one

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:45.949 
fire the tank destroyer robust puts one
round<00:03:44.040> into<00:03:44.459> him<00:03:44.580> and<00:03:44.730> I<00:03:44.970> finish<00:03:45.360> him<00:03:45.480> off<00:03:45.660> and

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:48.949 
round into him and I finish him off and
then<00:03:46.170> we<00:03:46.290> focus<00:03:46.680> fire<00:03:46.890> on<00:03:46.920> the<00:03:47.220> t29<00:03:47.820> he<00:03:48.630> doesn't
