how<00:00:12.920> to<00:00:12.980> check<00:00:13.430> coolant<00:00:14.060> level<00:00:14.450> in<00:00:14.800> total

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:17.450 
how to check coolant level in total

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:22.130 
how to check coolant level in total
okay<00:00:18.450> in<00:00:18.630> that<00:00:18.870> that<00:00:19.200> model<00:00:20.600> we<00:00:21.600> need<00:00:21.869> to

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
okay in that that model we need to

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.940 
okay in that that model we need to
firstly<00:00:23.210> take<00:00:24.210> those<00:00:24.599> this<00:00:24.990> take<00:00:25.770> this

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:25.950 
firstly take those this take this

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:30.679 
firstly take those this take this
plastic<00:00:26.250> cover<00:00:26.700> up<00:00:27.150> away<00:00:27.860> way<00:00:28.860> and<00:00:29.689> the

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
plastic cover up away way and the

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:36.049 
plastic cover up away way and the
response<00:00:31.170> is<00:00:32.510> plastic<00:00:33.510> air<00:00:34.640> clippers<00:00:35.670> but

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
response is plastic air clippers but

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.200 
response is plastic air clippers but
they<00:00:36.300> need<00:00:36.510> to<00:00:36.540> open<00:00:37.020> so<00:00:37.260> that<00:00:37.290> you<00:00:38.210> insert

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
they need to open so that you insert

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:46.090 
they need to open so that you insert
this<00:00:39.620> third<00:00:40.620> kind<00:00:40.920> of<00:00:41.070> tool<00:00:41.400> in<00:00:42.150> in<00:00:43.019> just<00:00:44.420> very

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:46.100 
this third kind of tool in in just very

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:50.000 
this third kind of tool in in just very
very<00:00:47.100> near<00:00:47.340> of<00:00:47.370> this<00:00:48.260> place<00:00:49.260> and<00:00:49.559> then<00:00:49.890> you<00:00:49.979> a

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
very near of this place and then you a

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.950 
very near of this place and then you a
little<00:00:50.339> bit<00:00:50.550> with<00:00:51.390> is<00:00:51.750> intend<00:00:52.440> this<00:00:52.589> opens<00:00:53.960> and

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
little bit with is intend this opens and

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.530 
little bit with is intend this opens and
there<00:00:55.229> is<00:00:56.330> idea<00:00:57.330> that<00:00:57.780> this<00:00:58.140> system<00:00:58.769> looks

00:00:59.530 --> 00:00:59.540 
there is idea that this system looks

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:05.450 
there is idea that this system looks
just<00:01:00.540> that<00:01:00.870> kind<00:01:01.199> of<00:01:02.750> clipper<00:01:04.220> now<00:01:05.220> it's

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
just that kind of clipper now it's

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.609 
just that kind of clipper now it's
closed<00:01:05.760> and<00:01:06.030> and<00:01:06.750> when<00:01:07.080> you<00:01:07.260> set<00:01:08.220> up<00:01:08.630> this<00:01:09.630> and

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
closed and and when you set up this and

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.120 
closed and and when you set up this and
you<00:01:10.770> set<00:01:10.979> up<00:01:11.010> this<00:01:11.340> tool<00:01:12.270> in<00:01:12.510> here<00:01:12.890> you<00:01:13.890> only

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
you set up this tool in here you only

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:21.450 
you set up this tool in here you only
only<00:01:14.610> twist<00:01:15.119> and<00:01:17.540> then<00:01:18.540> then<00:01:19.500> this<00:01:19.710> is<00:01:19.920> open

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:21.460 
only twist and then then this is open

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:28.370 
only twist and then then this is open
okay<00:01:22.030> cool

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:11.120 
this plastic cover why and here is this
our<00:02:07.470> coolant<00:02:08.039> system<00:02:09.200> first<00:02:10.200> there<00:02:10.800> is<00:02:10.950> this

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.130 
our coolant system first there is this

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:16.790 
our coolant system first there is this
cap<00:02:12.290> where<00:02:13.290> is<00:02:13.410> this<00:02:13.590> hose<00:02:15.200> but<00:02:16.200> I<00:02:16.260> have<00:02:16.560> been

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
cap where is this hose but I have been

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:22.009 
cap where is this hose but I have been
open<00:02:17.280> and<00:02:17.519> in<00:02:18.480> here<00:02:18.980> that<00:02:19.980> area<00:02:20.370> must<00:02:20.880> be<00:02:21.030> full
