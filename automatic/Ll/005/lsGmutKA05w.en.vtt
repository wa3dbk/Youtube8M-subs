plastic<00:00:29.220> is<00:00:29.640> nailed<00:00:30.029> to<00:00:30.510> the<00:00:30.630> wall<00:00:30.810> and<00:00:31.140> run

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
plastic is nailed to the wall and run

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.500 
plastic is nailed to the wall and run
into<00:00:31.859> a<00:00:31.980> trench<00:00:32.369> the<00:00:32.610> hand<00:00:32.850> dig<00:00:33.030> this<00:00:33.210> trench

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
into a trench the hand dig this trench

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.170 
into a trench the hand dig this trench
around<00:00:33.660> the<00:00:33.840> building<00:00:34.230> and<00:00:34.670> we'll<00:00:35.670> run<00:00:35.940> that

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
around the building and we'll run that

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.400 
around the building and we'll run that
plastic<00:00:37.020> down<00:00:37.440> under<00:00:38.190> the<00:00:38.309> trench<00:00:38.989> the<00:00:39.989> trench

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
plastic down under the trench the trench

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.819 
plastic down under the trench the trench
goes<00:00:40.829> around<00:00:41.070> the<00:00:41.370> entire<00:00:41.399> building<00:00:42.270> here<00:00:42.840> so

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
goes around the entire building here so

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.500 
goes around the entire building here so
we<00:00:43.920> can<00:00:44.040> get<00:00:44.100> a<00:00:44.160> shot<00:00:46.789> back<00:00:47.789> down<00:00:48.059> in<00:00:48.239> the<00:00:48.329> hole

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
we can get a shot back down in the hole

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.930 
we can get a shot back down in the hole
here<00:00:51.800> okay<00:00:52.800> so<00:00:52.829> that<00:00:53.039> black<00:00:53.250> plastic<00:00:53.520> runs

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
here okay so that black plastic runs

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.250 
here okay so that black plastic runs
down<00:00:54.149> into<00:00:54.449> the<00:00:54.539> trench<00:00:54.719> and<00:00:54.960> up<00:00:55.020> the<00:00:55.140> other

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.040 
down into the trench and up the other
side<00:00:55.559> then<00:00:56.070> there's<00:00:56.520> a<00:00:56.579> layer<00:00:56.730> of<00:00:56.879> rock<00:00:57.090> then

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
side then there's a layer of rock then

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.349 
side then there's a layer of rock then
perforated<00:00:58.500> pipe<00:00:58.920> another<00:00:59.609> layer<00:00:59.820> rock<00:01:00.180> on

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
perforated pipe another layer rock on

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.979 
perforated pipe another layer rock on

top of it and landscape fabric on top it
all<00:01:04.110> feeds<00:01:04.320> back<00:01:04.530> to<00:01:04.589> that<00:01:04.830> drain<00:01:05.129> you<00:01:05.309> can<00:01:05.339> see

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
all feeds back to that drain you can see

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.550 
all feeds back to that drain you can see
in<00:01:05.670> the<00:01:05.760> corner<00:01:06.060> there<00:01:06.360> that's<00:01:06.869> a<00:01:07.049> sump<00:01:07.350> pit

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
in the corner there that's a sump pit

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.109 
in the corner there that's a sump pit
from<00:01:07.770> there<00:01:08.040> we<00:01:08.220> can<00:01:08.340> pump<00:01:08.549> the<00:01:08.700> water<00:01:08.820> back

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
from there we can pump the water back

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:10.789 
from there we can pump the water back
out<00:01:09.240> of<00:01:09.299> the<00:01:09.450> house<00:01:09.570> if<00:01:09.780> it<00:01:09.869> gets<00:01:10.020> in<00:01:10.229> so<00:01:10.710> the

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
out of the house if it gets in so the

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.850 
out of the house if it gets in so the
point<00:01:11.070> of<00:01:11.130> this<00:01:11.280> is<00:01:11.610> to<00:01:12.409> collect<00:01:13.409> any<00:01:13.590> water

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
point of this is to collect any water

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.910 
point of this is to collect any water
that<00:01:14.159> runs<00:01:14.310> down<00:01:14.549> these<00:01:14.760> outside<00:01:15.180> walls<00:01:15.450> and

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:15.920 
that runs down these outside walls and

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:20.440 
that runs down these outside walls and

you can see these couple of pipes that

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.090 
you can see these couple of pipes that
stick<00:01:33.840> up<00:01:34.020> that's<00:01:34.259> the<00:01:34.350> same<00:01:34.590> pipe<00:01:34.860> that's

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
stick up that's the same pipe that's

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.010 
stick up that's the same pipe that's
running<00:01:35.280> around<00:01:35.400> the<00:01:35.579> house<00:01:35.759> we<00:01:36.600> stick<00:01:36.810> it<00:01:36.930> up

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
running around the house we stick it up

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.330 
running around the house we stick it up
into<00:01:37.140> the<00:01:37.259> window<00:01:37.530> wells<00:01:37.740> that's<00:01:38.070> the<00:01:38.130> same

into the window wells that's the same

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.740 
into the window wells that's the same
perforated<00:01:38.939> pipe<00:01:39.119> which<00:01:39.299> just<00:01:39.420> means<00:01:39.600> there's

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
perforated pipe which just means there's

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.929 
perforated pipe which just means there's
holes<00:01:39.990> in<00:01:40.170> the<00:01:40.259> side<00:01:40.439> of<00:01:40.470> the<00:01:40.619> pipe<00:01:40.799> and<00:01:41.280> that's

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
holes in the side of the pipe and that's

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.580 
holes in the side of the pipe and that's
wrapped<00:01:42.180> with<00:01:42.390> that<00:01:42.540> landscape<00:01:43.020> fabric<00:01:43.229> too

act<00:01:49.979> as<00:01:50.130> a<00:01:50.189> drain<00:01:50.549> and<00:01:50.880> pull<00:01:51.630> the<00:01:51.720> water<00:01:51.869> down

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
act as a drain and pull the water down

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.810 
act as a drain and pull the water down
I've<00:01:52.290> actually<00:01:52.470> seen<00:01:52.770> window<00:01:53.250> wells<00:01:53.460> filled

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
I've actually seen window wells filled

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.350 
I've actually seen window wells filled
up<00:01:53.970> completely<00:01:54.509> looks<00:01:55.049> like<00:01:55.200> a<00:01:55.229> fish<00:01:55.680> tank<00:01:56.360> and

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
up completely looks like a fish tank and

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.450 
up completely looks like a fish tank and
it's<00:01:57.540> not<00:01:57.750> pretty<00:01:57.990> here<00:01:58.829> you<00:01:58.920> can<00:01:59.040> see<00:01:59.219> where

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
it's not pretty here you can see where

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.450 
it's not pretty here you can see where
the<00:02:00.090> system<00:02:01.020> runs<00:02:01.259> underneath<00:02:01.829> these<00:02:02.040> counter

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
the system runs underneath these counter

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.340 
the system runs underneath these counter
forts<00:02:02.820> we<00:02:03.299> looked<00:02:03.479> at<00:02:03.600> the<00:02:03.689> counter<00:02:03.930> forts<00:02:04.259> at

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
forts we looked at the counter forts at

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.069 
forts we looked at the counter forts at
the<00:02:04.469> video<00:02:04.680> on<00:02:05.149> foundation<00:02:06.149> walls<00:02:06.360> you<00:02:07.049> see

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
the video on foundation walls you see

the video on foundation walls you see
there<00:02:07.409> they<00:02:07.530> just<00:02:07.560> go<00:02:07.799> under<00:02:08.220> it<00:02:08.369> and<00:02:08.550> the<00:02:08.849> so

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
there they just go under it and the so

there they just go under it and the so
you<00:02:09.119> see<00:02:09.300> the<00:02:10.039> footing<00:02:11.039> and<00:02:11.489> then<00:02:11.670> that

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
you see the footing and then that

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.520 
you see the footing and then that
our<00:02:12.030> fort<00:02:12.360> so<00:02:12.870> they<00:02:12.990> just<00:02:13.140> trenched

be below ground now the basement that's
below<00:02:41.670> ground<00:02:42.000> is<00:02:42.270> where<00:02:42.450> we<00:02:42.570> are<00:02:42.600> so<00:02:43.050> between

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:43.320 
below ground is where we are so between

this garage wall and the basement wall
we've<00:02:46.380> got<00:02:46.560> to<00:02:46.650> continue<00:02:46.980> that<00:02:47.370> drain<00:02:47.810> so<00:02:48.810> it

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
we've got to continue that drain so it

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.500 
we've got to continue that drain so it
cuts<00:02:49.200> around<00:02:49.530> there's<00:02:50.459> basement<00:02:50.970> wall<00:02:51.120> now

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
cuts around there's basement wall now

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.300 
cuts around there's basement wall now
we're<00:02:51.660> inside<00:02:52.080> the<00:02:52.260> garage<00:02:52.470> actually<00:02:53.130> that's

underneath the garage floor and it

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:59.810 
underneath the garage floor and it
follows<00:02:56.310> around<00:02:56.670> here<00:02:58.430> you'll<00:02:59.430> see<00:02:59.610> it<00:02:59.700> just

00:02:59.810 --> 00:02:59.820 
follows around here you'll see it just

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:01.430 
follows around here you'll see it just
comes<00:03:00.030> to<00:03:00.150> the<00:03:00.180> edge<00:03:00.330> of<00:03:00.450> the<00:03:00.510> garage<00:03:00.750> turns<00:03:01.320> a

comes to the edge of the garage turns a

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.199 
comes to the edge of the garage turns a
corner<00:03:01.620> and<00:03:02.160> continues<00:03:02.610> down<00:03:02.820> around<00:03:03.060> the

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
corner and continues down around the

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:05.690 
corner and continues down around the
house<00:03:03.530> once<00:03:04.530> again<00:03:04.740> you<00:03:05.190> get<00:03:05.400> underneath

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
house once again you get underneath

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:09.050 
house once again you get underneath
those<00:03:05.970> counter<00:03:06.300> forts<00:03:06.660> so<00:03:07.640> that<00:03:08.640> is<00:03:08.880> the

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
those counter forts so that is the

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.260 
those counter forts so that is the
system<00:03:10.280> jump<00:03:11.280> down<00:03:11.459> here<00:03:11.670> in<00:03:11.760> a<00:03:11.820> minute<00:03:12.060> here

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:12.270 
system jump down here in a minute here

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:13.910 
system jump down here in a minute here
and<00:03:12.420> get<00:03:12.660> you<00:03:12.810> shot<00:03:13.020> close<00:03:13.350> and<00:03:13.590> you<00:03:13.650> can<00:03:13.770> see

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
and get you shot close and you can see

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:22.720 
and get you shot close and you can see
actually<00:03:14.040> how<00:03:14.370> that's<00:03:14.580> put<00:03:14.850> together

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:22.730 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:25.550 

that's<00:03:23.730> the<00:03:24.050> excavation<00:03:25.050> for<00:03:25.170> the<00:03:25.260> counter

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
that's the excavation for the counter

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:26.979 
that's the excavation for the counter
fort<00:03:25.800> you<00:03:25.860> can<00:03:25.980> see<00:03:26.100> where<00:03:26.250> they<00:03:26.340> had<00:03:26.430> to<00:03:26.550> use<00:03:26.580> a

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:26.989 
fort you can see where they had to use a

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:29.479 
fort you can see where they had to use a
bucket<00:03:27.989> just<00:03:28.260> to<00:03:28.410> dig<00:03:28.560> that<00:03:28.739> little<00:03:28.950> trench<00:03:29.280> to

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:29.489 
bucket just to dig that little trench to

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:34.820 
bucket just to dig that little trench to
make<00:03:29.610> that<00:03:29.850> fit<00:03:32.330> okay<00:03:33.330> so<00:03:33.390> now<00:03:33.690> down<00:03:33.959> in<00:03:34.380> the

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:34.830 
make that fit okay so now down in the

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:37.910 
make that fit okay so now down in the
pit<00:03:35.430> itself<00:03:35.930> you<00:03:36.930> see<00:03:36.959> the<00:03:37.230> plastic<00:03:37.620> that<00:03:37.739> runs

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920 
pit itself you see the plastic that runs

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:39.170 
pit itself you see the plastic that runs
underneath<00:03:38.190> and<00:03:38.489> here<00:03:38.610> I've<00:03:38.730> scraped<00:03:38.970> back

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
underneath and here I've scraped back

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:40.340 
underneath and here I've scraped back
some<00:03:39.360> of<00:03:39.420> the<00:03:39.510> rock<00:03:39.720> and<00:03:39.900> you<00:03:39.959> can<00:03:40.080> see<00:03:40.200> this

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:40.350 
some of the rock and you can see this

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:43.280 
some of the rock and you can see this
pipe<00:03:40.650> it's<00:03:41.400> kind<00:03:41.880> of<00:03:41.970> like<00:03:42.120> an<00:03:42.239> ABS<00:03:42.810> it's<00:03:43.140> a

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
pipe it's kind of like an ABS it's a

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:46.810 
pipe it's kind of like an ABS it's a
drainage<00:03:44.100> pipe<00:03:44.130> it's<00:03:44.670> not<00:03:45.000> as<00:03:45.299> high<00:03:45.510> a<00:03:45.540> density

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:46.820 
drainage pipe it's not as high a density

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:49.850 
drainage pipe it's not as high a density
but<00:03:47.820> it's<00:03:47.970> got<00:03:48.120> holes<00:03:48.330> drilled<00:03:49.140> in<00:03:49.350> the<00:03:49.410> sides

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:49.860 
but it's got holes drilled in the sides

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:52.400 
but it's got holes drilled in the sides
like<00:03:50.400> quarter<00:03:50.940> inch<00:03:51.090> holes<00:03:51.330> just<00:03:51.630> along<00:03:52.260> the

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:52.410 
like quarter inch holes just along the

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:54.140 
like quarter inch holes just along the
left<00:03:52.680> and<00:03:52.860> right<00:03:53.040> side<00:03:53.310> that<00:03:53.549> way<00:03:53.670> water<00:03:53.880> can

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150 
left and right side that way water can

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:55.820 
left and right side that way water can
enter<00:03:54.330> but<00:03:54.720> then<00:03:54.840> it's<00:03:55.080> got<00:03:55.200> a<00:03:55.260> solid<00:03:55.680> surface

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:55.830 
enter but then it's got a solid surface

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:58.340 
enter but then it's got a solid surface
to<00:03:56.130> run<00:03:56.370> in<00:03:56.549> down<00:03:56.760> the<00:03:56.940> bottom<00:03:57.269> of<00:03:57.360> the<00:03:57.480> pipe<00:03:57.690> so

00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:58.350 
to run in down the bottom of the pipe so

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:00.140 
to run in down the bottom of the pipe so
that's<00:03:58.470> why<00:03:58.590> you<00:03:58.650> can't<00:03:58.890> see<00:03:59.100> them<00:03:59.220> here<00:03:59.430> but

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150 
that's why you can't see them here but

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:03.440 
that's why you can't see them here but
so<00:04:00.450> plastic<00:04:00.959> then<00:04:01.769> rock<00:04:02.100> the<00:04:02.459> pipe<00:04:02.700> more<00:04:03.239> rock

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.450 
so plastic then rock the pipe more rock

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:06.440 
so plastic then rock the pipe more rock
on<00:04:03.690> top<00:04:04.190> and<00:04:05.190> when<00:04:05.610> that's<00:04:05.790> all<00:04:05.970> said<00:04:06.030> and<00:04:06.360> done

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.450 
on top and when that's all said and done

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:08.570 
on top and when that's all said and done
we've<00:04:06.989> got<00:04:07.170> this<00:04:07.290> landscape<00:04:07.860> fabric<00:04:08.070> on<00:04:08.400> top

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:08.580 
we've got this landscape fabric on top

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:09.979 
we've got this landscape fabric on top
to<00:04:08.760> keep<00:04:08.910> dirt<00:04:09.239> from<00:04:09.450> getting<00:04:09.720> into<00:04:09.840> the

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:09.989 
to keep dirt from getting into the

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:12.620 
to keep dirt from getting into the
system<00:04:10.410> now<00:04:10.650> this<00:04:11.580> is<00:04:11.760> all<00:04:11.880> open<00:04:12.120> because<00:04:12.510> it

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:12.630 
system now this is all open because it

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:14.150 
system now this is all open because it
does<00:04:12.780> need<00:04:12.989> to<00:04:13.019> be<00:04:13.080> inspected<00:04:13.650> and<00:04:13.830> so<00:04:14.040> I've

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:14.160 
does need to be inspected and so I've

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.039 
does need to be inspected and so I've
got<00:04:14.310> this<00:04:14.459> called<00:04:14.730> for<00:04:14.910> an<00:04:15.000> inspection<00:04:15.360> it'll

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 
got this called for an inspection it'll

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:17.719 
got this called for an inspection it'll
come<00:04:16.200> out<00:04:16.320> check<00:04:16.650> a<00:04:16.680> few<00:04:16.769> places<00:04:17.340> make<00:04:17.549> sure

00:04:17.719 --> 00:04:17.729 
come out check a few places make sure

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:19.699 
come out check a few places make sure
that<00:04:18.000> the<00:04:18.390> slope<00:04:18.720> looks<00:04:18.750> right<00:04:19.200> on<00:04:19.229> that<00:04:19.470> pipe

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:19.709 
that the slope looks right on that pipe

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:22.400 
that the slope looks right on that pipe
that<00:04:19.739> it's<00:04:20.099> actually<00:04:20.609> level<00:04:21.270> because<00:04:22.169> as<00:04:22.260> long

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:22.410 
that it's actually level because as long

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:24.350 
that it's actually level because as long
as<00:04:22.470> it's<00:04:22.740> level<00:04:22.950> it's<00:04:23.280> going<00:04:23.580> to<00:04:23.700> run

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360 
as it's level it's going to run

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:25.860 
as it's level it's going to run
naturally<00:04:25.110> to<00:04:25.289> the<00:04:25.410> pit

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:25.870 
naturally to the pit

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:28.620 
naturally to the pit
is<00:04:25.960> its<00:04:26.169> only<00:04:26.320> way<00:04:26.560> out<00:04:26.740> and<00:04:27.360> he's<00:04:28.360> going<00:04:28.540> to

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:28.630 
is its only way out and he's going to

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:30.150 
is its only way out and he's going to
make<00:04:28.720> sure<00:04:28.900> that<00:04:29.050> the<00:04:29.169> plastic<00:04:29.650> is<00:04:29.740> up<00:04:29.860> like<00:04:30.040> it

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:30.160 
make sure that the plastic is up like it

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:32.700 
make sure that the plastic is up like it
should<00:04:30.370> be<00:04:30.520> under<00:04:30.790> the<00:04:30.880> foundation<00:04:31.419> so<00:04:31.720> that's

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:32.710 
should be under the foundation so that's

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:39.060 
should be under the foundation so that's
it<00:04:36.690> if<00:04:37.690> you<00:04:37.900> want<00:04:38.050> to<00:04:38.080> reach<00:04:38.229> me<00:04:38.260> you<00:04:38.500> can<00:04:38.590> look

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:39.070 
it if you want to reach me you can look

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:41.729 
it if you want to reach me you can look
