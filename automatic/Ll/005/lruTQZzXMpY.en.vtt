onto the spiders and then the tissue
paper<00:01:28.439> will<00:01:28.860> absorb<00:01:29.340> it<00:01:29.549> and<00:01:29.700> it<00:01:29.790> will<00:01:30.049> keep<00:01:31.049> it

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
keep still humidity high in there for

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.289 
keep still humidity high in there for
them<00:01:42.590> and<00:01:43.590> you<00:01:44.040> do<00:01:44.189> have<00:01:44.340> the<00:01:44.520> ventilation

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
them and you do have the ventilation

them and you do have the ventilation
already<00:01:45.570> built<00:01:45.780> in<00:01:45.990> so<00:01:46.970> yeah<00:01:47.970> that's<00:01:48.360> about<00:01:48.450> it

00:01:48.999 --> 00:01:49.009 
already built in so yeah that's about it

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:53.359 
already built in so yeah that's about it
and<00:01:50.119> the<00:01:51.119> only<00:01:51.380> downside<00:01:52.380> is<00:01:52.409> these<00:01:52.920> holes<00:01:53.189> are

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
and the only downside is these holes are

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.749 
and the only downside is these holes are
big<00:01:53.549> large<00:01:53.880> enough<00:01:54.180> that<00:01:54.450> the<00:01:55.369> second<00:01:56.369> instars

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
big large enough that the second instars

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.429 
big large enough that the second instars
will<00:01:57.119> be<00:01:57.240> able<00:01:57.360> to<00:01:57.540> climb<00:01:57.750> the<00:01:57.960> size<00:01:58.140> and

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
will be able to climb the size and

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.560 
will be able to climb the size and
escape<00:01:58.770> you<00:01:59.399> want<00:01:59.549> about<00:01:59.610> yourself<00:02:00.270> if<00:02:00.390> you

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
escape you want about yourself if you

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:01.510 
escape you want about yourself if you
notice<00:02:01.049> them

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:01.520 
notice them
