that game now one of the things that

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.500 
that game now one of the things that
came<00:00:47.280> out<00:00:47.399> of<00:00:47.460> it<00:00:47.670> least<00:00:47.879> according<00:00:48.180> to<00:00:48.390> what

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
came out of it least according to what

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.119 
came out of it least according to what
some<00:00:48.690> of<00:00:48.719> the<00:00:48.840> coaches<00:00:49.020> said<00:00:49.410> is<00:00:49.559> that<00:00:49.950> there

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.220 
some of the coaches said is that there
was<00:00:50.370> pass<00:00:50.640> blocking<00:00:51.000> mishaps<00:00:51.660> and<00:00:51.899> what<00:00:52.199> I

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
was pass blocking mishaps and what I

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.470 
was pass blocking mishaps and what I
think<00:00:52.800> will<00:00:53.160> happen<00:00:53.309> is<00:00:53.640> that<00:00:53.850> Georgia<00:00:54.239> will

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
think will happen is that Georgia will

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.529 
think will happen is that Georgia will
use<00:00:54.960> go<00:00:55.410> through<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:55.710> a<00:00:55.739> gaps<00:00:56.250> okay<00:00:56.850> right<00:00:57.420> up

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
use go through the a gaps okay right up

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.209 
use go through the a gaps okay right up
the<00:00:57.660> middle<00:00:57.840> some<00:00:58.440> will<00:00:58.620> do<00:00:58.710> it<00:00:58.829> Southeast

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219

and I think that Missouri might be in

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:58.430 
and I think that Missouri might be in
for<00:02:57.209> a<00:02:57.420> rude<00:02:57.510> awakening<00:02:57.630> here<00:02:58.170> I'm<00:02:58.260> definitely
