I'm just going to lift out that vein see

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:31.300 
I'm just going to lift out that vein see
how<00:00:28.160> easy<00:00:28.340> that<00:00:28.430> was<00:00:28.580> and<00:00:29.920> smooth<00:00:30.920> off<00:00:31.130> the

vein has to be wider at the top and at
the<00:00:35.840> bottom<00:00:36.520> before<00:00:37.520> we<00:00:37.640> can<00:00:37.760> paint<00:00:37.940> it<00:00:38.120> in<00:00:39.910> so

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:40.910 
the bottom before we can paint it in so

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:45.340 
the bottom before we can paint it in so
I'll<00:00:41.030> just<00:00:41.239> smooth<00:00:41.600> that<00:00:41.780> down<00:00:44.200> from<00:00:45.200> you're

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:45.350 
I'll just smooth that down from you're

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:47.350 
I'll just smooth that down from you're
busy<00:00:45.590> putting<00:00:45.770> a<00:00:45.920> dark<00:00:46.129> wash<00:00:46.460> on<00:00:46.700> the<00:00:46.850> leaf<00:00:47.030> you

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:47.360 
busy putting a dark wash on the leaf you

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.340 
busy putting a dark wash on the leaf you
can't<00:00:48.350> always<00:00:48.559> get<00:00:48.950> the<00:00:49.450> vein<00:00:50.450> exactly

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:51.350 
can't always get the vein exactly

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:53.139 
can't always get the vein exactly
accurate<00:00:51.800> now<00:00:52.280> I'm<00:00:52.399> going<00:00:52.579> to<00:00:52.670> come<00:00:52.820> down<00:00:53.030> the

00:00:53.139 --> 00:00:53.149 
accurate now I'm going to come down the

00:00:53.149 --> 00:01:09.649 
accurate now I'm going to come down the
side<00:00:56.170> with<00:00:57.170> a<00:00:57.199> dark<00:00:57.500> shadow

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.330 

then<00:01:10.259> I<00:01:10.350> lose<00:01:10.710> that<00:01:11.070> edge<00:01:12.499> put<00:01:13.499> that<00:01:13.649> in<00:01:13.799> just

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
then I lose that edge put that in just

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.700 
then I lose that edge put that in just
going<00:01:14.520> to<00:01:14.609> lose<00:01:14.819> the<00:01:15.060> edge<00:01:15.179> of<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:15.479> dark<00:01:15.749> area

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
going to lose the edge of the dark area

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.639 
going to lose the edge of the dark area
and<00:01:16.979> that's<00:01:17.670> letting<00:01:18.000> me<00:01:18.270> some<00:01:18.780> veins<00:01:19.020> further

00:01:19.639 --> 00:01:19.649 
and that's letting me some veins further

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:22.639 
and that's letting me some veins further
down<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:20.009> left<00:01:20.600> I'm<00:01:21.600> going<00:01:21.869> when<00:01:22.229> it's<00:01:22.380> dry

00:01:22.639 --> 00:01:22.649 
down the left I'm going when it's dry

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:27.260 
down the left I'm going when it's dry
I'll<00:01:22.950> fill<00:01:23.369> in<00:01:23.490> the<00:01:23.630> mid<00:01:24.630> rib<00:01:25.399> with<00:01:26.399> a<00:01:26.789> yellowy

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
I'll fill in the mid rib with a yellowy

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.249 
I'll fill in the mid rib with a yellowy
green<00:01:28.369> color<00:01:29.369> of<00:01:29.579> the<00:01:29.670> midrib<00:01:30.000> but<00:01:30.750> until<00:01:31.049> then

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
green color of the midrib but until then

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.849 
green color of the midrib but until then
I'll<00:01:31.530> just<00:01:31.979> wait<00:01:32.250> I<00:01:33.200> can<00:01:34.200> just<00:01:34.380> go<00:01:34.500> down<00:01:34.560> either

00:01:34.849 --> 00:01:34.859 
I'll just wait I can just go down either

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:42.919 
I'll just wait I can just go down either
side<00:01:36.590> redefining<00:01:38.719> what<00:01:39.719> I've<00:01:39.869> painted<00:01:41.929> and

00:01:42.919 --> 00:01:42.929 
side redefining what I've painted and

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:46.249 
side redefining what I've painted and
refining<00:01:43.500> the<00:01:43.770> leaf<00:01:44.509> still<00:01:45.509> not<00:01:45.689> quite<00:01:45.989> ready

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
refining the leaf still not quite ready

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:52.429 
refining the leaf still not quite ready
to<00:01:47.219> do<00:01:47.429> the<00:01:48.530> brush<00:01:50.329> to<00:01:51.329> do<00:01:51.479> the<00:01:51.629> mid<00:01:51.840> right<00:01:52.049> rib

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
to do the brush to do the mid right rib

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:55.940 
to do the brush to do the mid right rib
yet<00:01:53.390> but<00:01:54.390> I'm<00:01:54.479> going<00:01:54.689> to<00:01:54.719> come<00:01:54.929> down<00:01:54.959> here<00:01:55.469> I'm

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
yet but I'm going to come down here I'm

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.969 
yet but I'm going to come down here I'm
adding<00:01:56.250> some<00:01:56.670> little<00:01:57.179> highlights<00:01:57.799> or<00:01:58.799> some

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
adding some little highlights or some

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.010 
adding some little highlights or some
shadows<00:01:59.340> to<00:01:59.520> make<00:01:59.700> the<00:02:00.000> highlight<00:02:00.390> stand<00:02:00.780> out

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
shadows to make the highlight stand out

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.179 
shadows to make the highlight stand out
on<00:02:02.009> those<00:02:02.219> veins<00:02:03.530> with<00:02:04.530> the<00:02:04.619> light<00:02:04.799> coming

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
on those veins with the light coming

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:06.559 
on those veins with the light coming
from<00:02:05.219> upper<00:02:06.030> left

00:02:06.559 --> 00:02:06.569 
from upper left

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:08.419 
from upper left
I'm<00:02:07.109> going<00:02:07.409> to<00:02:07.469> have<00:02:07.590> a<00:02:07.619> shadow<00:02:07.950> down<00:02:08.250> this

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
I'm going to have a shadow down this

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.550 
I'm going to have a shadow down this
side<00:02:08.670> of<00:02:08.849> the<00:02:08.910> midrib<00:02:09.269> so<00:02:09.989> I'll<00:02:10.170> put<00:02:10.379> that<00:02:10.500> in

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
side of the midrib so I'll put that in

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:16.230 
side of the midrib so I'll put that in
right<00:02:10.890> now

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:16.240 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:19.320 

and<00:02:16.780> I<00:02:16.930> can<00:02:17.110> start<00:02:17.380> suggesting<00:02:18.090> some<00:02:19.090> other

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
and I can start suggesting some other

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:22.590 
and I can start suggesting some other
veins<00:02:19.600> lose<00:02:20.590> one<00:02:21.040> side<00:02:21.400> of<00:02:21.580> that<00:02:21.730> line<00:02:21.970> soften

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:22.600 
veins lose one side of that line soften

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:29.010 
veins lose one side of that line soften
it<00:02:24.510> so<00:02:25.510> it's<00:02:25.780> not<00:02:25.960> too<00:02:26.230> harsh<00:02:27.570> this<00:02:28.570> needs<00:02:28.900> to

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:29.020 
it so it's not too harsh this needs to

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:38.300 
it so it's not too harsh this needs to
be<00:02:29.110> narrowed

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.370
