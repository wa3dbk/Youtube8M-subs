within<00:00:17.609> blender<00:00:18.000> so<00:00:18.240> i<00:00:18.449> want<00:00:18.960> to<00:00:19.050> show<00:00:19.230> you

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
within blender so i want to show you

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.220 
within blender so i want to show you
that<00:00:19.380> the<00:00:19.770> process<00:00:20.460> of<00:00:20.640> that<00:00:20.850> it<00:00:21.180> might<00:00:21.660> seem

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
here is taking shifted d the ball and

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.119 
here is taking shifted d the ball and
make<00:00:50.789> a<00:00:50.820> duplicate<00:00:51.059> of<00:00:51.360> it<00:00:51.920> okay<00:00:52.920> this<00:00:53.039> is

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
make a duplicate of it okay this is

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:58.279 
make a duplicate of it okay this is
going<00:00:53.219> to<00:00:53.309> be<00:00:53.370> ball<00:00:53.640> two<00:00:55.280> so<00:00:56.280> immediately<00:00:57.289> I'm

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
going to be ball two so immediately I'm

really seriously work in blender you

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.130 
really seriously work in blender you
better<00:01:14.760> start<00:01:15.060> getting<00:01:15.240> used<00:01:15.390> to<00:01:15.720> naming

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
better start getting used to naming

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.440 
better start getting used to naming
things<00:01:16.380> because<00:01:17.189> a<00:01:17.220> lot<00:01:17.670> of<00:01:17.700> stuff<00:01:18.030> relies

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
things because a lot of stuff relies

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.960 
things because a lot of stuff relies
relies<00:01:19.290> on<00:01:19.320> the<00:01:19.710> naming<00:01:20.130> convention<00:01:20.670> with<00:01:20.820> in

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
relies on the naming convention with in

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.070 
relies on the naming convention with in
blender<00:01:22.159> okay<00:01:23.159> there's<00:01:23.640> ball<00:01:23.939> two<00:01:24.210> ball<00:01:24.750> two

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:17.090 
on this one ball one still pops up okay
make<00:02:13.630> sure<00:02:13.660> you<00:02:14.530> switch<00:02:14.800> this<00:02:15.220> tab<00:02:15.520> 2<00:02:15.820> ball<00:02:16.030> 2

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
make sure you switch this tab 2 ball 2

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.070 
make sure you switch this tab 2 ball 2
so<00:02:18.100> now<00:02:18.340> let's<00:02:18.610> test<00:02:18.820> that<00:02:18.940> out<00:02:19.060> Paul<00:02:19.540> one<00:02:19.780> ball

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
so now let's test that out Paul one ball

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:25.200 
so now let's test that out Paul one ball
two<00:02:20.500> good<00:02:21.330> now<00:02:22.330> we<00:02:22.840> need<00:02:22.870> another<00:02:23.940> texture<00:02:24.940> in

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:25.210 
two good now we need another texture in

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:27.600 
two good now we need another texture in
on<00:02:25.570> the<00:02:25.780> mix<00:02:26.020> notice<00:02:26.920> I<00:02:27.010> don't<00:02:27.220> have<00:02:27.310> anything

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
on the mix notice I don't have anything

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:30.020 
on the mix notice I don't have anything
within<00:02:27.910> my<00:02:28.060> texture<00:02:28.630> menu<00:02:28.960> however<00:02:29.290> right

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
within my texture menu however right

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.430 
within my texture menu however right
okay<00:02:31.030> because<00:02:31.540> I<00:02:31.570> had<00:02:31.780> to<00:02:31.900> get<00:02:32.050> rid<00:02:32.230> of<00:02:32.290> that

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
okay because I had to get rid of that

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.010 
okay because I had to get rid of that
because<00:02:32.830> it<00:02:33.070> was<00:02:33.220> it<00:02:33.580> was<00:02:33.760> getting<00:02:34.600> in<00:02:34.720> the<00:02:34.810> way

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:35.020 
because it was it was getting in the way

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:38.080 
of this fall right here so let's go in

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:42.740 
of this fall right here so let's go in
and<00:02:39.240> go<00:02:40.240> to<00:02:40.360> edit<00:02:40.480> mode<00:02:40.750> by<00:02:40.959> going<00:02:41.260> to<00:02:41.350> tab<00:02:41.620> and

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
go into the uv/image editor and make a

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.590 
go into the uv/image editor and make a
new<00:02:46.810> texture<00:02:47.170> going<00:02:47.800> image<00:02:48.130> new<00:02:48.760> let's<00:02:49.480> make

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:49.600 
new texture going image new let's make

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:50.970 
new texture going image new let's make
this<00:02:49.720> a<00:02:49.780> different<00:02:50.200> color<00:02:50.380> so<00:02:50.590> we<00:02:50.709> don't<00:02:50.860> get

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
this a different color so we don't get

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:56.120 
this a different color so we don't get
it<00:02:51.130> too<00:02:51.459> confusing<00:02:51.700> let's<00:02:52.330> make<00:02:53.020> it<00:02:53.050> a<00:02:53.230> read

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130

with ball two I'm going to add a new

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:25.620 
with ball two I'm going to add a new
texture<00:03:21.900> and<00:03:23.040> in<00:03:24.040> texture<00:03:24.970> 1<00:03:25.239> i'm<00:03:25.420> going<00:03:25.480> to

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:25.630 
texture and in texture 1 i'm going to

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:31.620 
texture and in texture 1 i'm going to
call<00:03:25.810> this<00:03:25.840> ball<00:03:26.560> two<00:03:26.830> and<00:03:30.120> then<00:03:31.120> immediately

go<00:03:31.900> over<00:03:32.080> to<00:03:32.200> the<00:03:32.320> texture<00:03:32.680> tab<00:03:34.769> where<00:03:35.769> i'm

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:35.890 
go over to the texture tab where i'm

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:42.860 
go over to the texture tab where i'm
going<00:03:36.100> to<00:03:36.220> come<00:03:36.430> upon<00:03:36.760> this<00:03:37.739> okay<00:03:38.739> now<00:03:39.959> notice

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
going to come upon this okay now notice

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:46.530 
going to come upon this okay now notice
ball<00:03:43.870> one<00:03:44.230> ball<00:03:45.160> two<00:03:45.430> still<00:03:45.700> highlights<00:03:46.090> good

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540 
ball one ball two still highlights good

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:50.280 
ball one ball two still highlights good
and<00:03:47.550> by<00:03:48.550> going<00:03:48.820> into<00:03:49.030> the<00:03:49.239> texture<00:03:49.690> i<00:03:49.870> should

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:50.290 
and by going into the texture i should

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:52.110 
and by going into the texture i should
be<00:03:50.470> able<00:03:50.500> to<00:03:50.830> see<00:03:51.430> how<00:03:51.519> this<00:03:51.700> one's<00:03:51.910> still

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:52.120 
be able to see how this one's still

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.810 
be able to see how this one's still
active<00:03:52.690> to<00:03:53.230> get<00:03:53.440> to<00:03:53.590> this<00:03:53.709> one<00:03:54.010> this<00:03:54.459> is<00:03:54.640> where

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:54.820 
active to get to this one this is where

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:56.699 
active to get to this one this is where
you<00:03:54.970> have<00:03:55.120> to<00:03:55.239> use<00:03:55.390> the<00:03:55.570> node<00:03:55.810> editor<00:03:55.840> as<00:03:56.380> i

00:03:56.699 --> 00:03:56.709 
you have to use the node editor as i

00:03:56.709 --> 00:03:58.470 
you have to use the node editor as i
said<00:03:56.920> now<00:03:57.250> too<00:03:57.549> straightforward<00:03:57.880> is<00:03:58.299> it

00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:58.480 
said now too straightforward is it

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:00.570 
said now too straightforward is it
because<00:03:59.200> look<00:03:59.470> at<00:03:59.530> the<00:03:59.650> check<00:03:59.830> this<00:03:59.980> out<00:04:00.220> if<00:04:00.489> i

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:00.580 
because look at the check this out if i

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:04.440 
because look at the check this out if i
go<00:04:00.700> to<00:04:00.730> ball<00:04:00.970> two<00:04:01.180> I<00:04:01.890> now<00:04:02.890> have<00:04:03.280> a<00:04:03.310> blank<00:04:03.910> spot

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:04.450 
go to ball two I now have a blank spot

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:10.750 
go to ball two I now have a blank spot
here<00:04:05.080> that<00:04:05.830> I<00:04:05.860> can<00:04:06.130> go<00:04:06.900> image<00:04:08.910> load

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:10.760 
here that I can go image load

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:17.319 
here that I can go image load
and<00:04:11.379> load<00:04:12.379> video<00:04:13.250> to<00:04:13.340> Perry<00:04:13.970> TGA<00:04:16.060> just<00:04:17.060> like

00:04:17.319 --> 00:04:17.329 
and load video to Perry TGA just like

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:20.259 
and load video to Perry TGA just like
that<00:04:18.370> so<00:04:19.370> that's<00:04:19.519> where<00:04:19.729> it<00:04:19.850> gets<00:04:19.880> a<00:04:20.150> little

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:20.269 
that so that's where it gets a little

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:23.200 
that so that's where it gets a little
confusing<00:04:20.510> at<00:04:20.900> times<00:04:20.959> i<00:04:22.150> noticed<00:04:23.150> that

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:23.210 
confusing at times i noticed that

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:25.629 
confusing at times i noticed that
texture<00:04:23.810> back<00:04:23.990> there<00:04:24.229> was<00:04:24.650> named<00:04:24.919> texture

00:04:25.629 --> 00:04:25.639 
texture back there was named texture

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:31.629 
texture back there was named texture
just<00:04:26.540> TX<00:04:28.270> and<00:04:29.270> we'll<00:04:29.419> leave<00:04:29.630> it<00:04:29.750> alone<00:04:30.639> it's

00:04:31.629 --> 00:04:31.639 
just TX and we'll leave it alone it's

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:33.520 
just TX and we'll leave it alone it's
easy<00:04:31.880> to<00:04:32.060> rename<00:04:32.389> it<00:04:32.539> by<00:04:32.660> going<00:04:32.840> back<00:04:33.169> but<00:04:33.500> i

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:33.530 
easy to rename it by going back but i

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:35.290 
easy to rename it by going back but i
don't<00:04:33.830> want<00:04:33.949> to<00:04:34.010> do<00:04:34.100> that<00:04:34.130> for<00:04:34.400> the<00:04:34.490> video<00:04:34.729> also

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:35.300 
don't want to do that for the video also

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:37.840 
don't want to do that for the video also
we<00:04:36.080> got<00:04:36.229> the<00:04:36.440> red<00:04:36.620> ball<00:04:36.800> we<00:04:37.340> want<00:04:37.550> something

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:37.850

written on it of course just for the

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:43.420 
written on it of course just for the
aesthetic<00:04:40.039> appeal<00:04:40.430> of<00:04:40.639> it<00:04:41.260> okay<00:04:42.260> so<00:04:42.979> let's

00:04:53.229 --> 00:04:58.420 

now<00:04:54.229> i'm<00:04:54.380> not<00:04:54.410> seeing<00:04:55.000> this<00:04:56.000> real-time<00:04:57.430> okay

00:04:58.420 --> 00:04:58.430 
now i'm not seeing this real-time okay

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:07.450 
now i'm not seeing this real-time okay
let's<00:04:59.000> not<00:04:59.180> showing<00:04:59.600> up<00:05:01.870> so<00:05:02.870> hit<00:05:03.289> a<00:05:03.320> render<00:05:06.460> and

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:07.460 
let's not showing up so hit a render and

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:10.689 
let's not showing up so hit a render and
then<00:05:07.880> immediately<00:05:08.210> go<00:05:08.810> over<00:05:08.990> to<00:05:09.169> ball<00:05:09.410> to<00:05:09.699> go

00:05:10.689 --> 00:05:10.699 
then immediately go over to ball to go

00:05:10.699 --> 00:05:12.700 
then immediately go over to ball to go
back<00:05:10.910> into<00:05:11.120> the<00:05:11.270> material<00:05:11.630> tab<00:05:11.960> and<00:05:12.229> make<00:05:12.289> sure

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:12.710 
back into the material tab and make sure

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:19.750 
back into the material tab and make sure
you<00:05:13.010> clear<00:05:13.370> out<00:05:13.610> that<00:05:14.380> ball<00:05:18.250> there<00:05:19.250> we<00:05:19.340> go<00:05:19.520> and

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:19.760 
you clear out that ball there we go and

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:22.029 
you clear out that ball there we go and
that's<00:05:19.910> your<00:05:20.000> workflow<00:05:20.539> you<00:05:21.349> know<00:05:21.470> repeat

00:05:22.029 --> 00:05:22.039 
that's your workflow you know repeat

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:38.260 
attach other textures to it this is just
using<00:05:35.900> the<00:05:36.229> diffuser<00:05:36.680> color<00:05:37.039> channel<00:05:37.460> so<00:05:38.090> how

using the diffuser color channel so how
do<00:05:38.330> i<00:05:38.479> get<00:05:38.780> a<00:05:38.810> normal<00:05:39.020> map<00:05:39.380> or<00:05:39.560> displacement

00:05:40.029 --> 00:05:40.039 
do i get a normal map or displacement

00:05:40.039 --> 00:05:42.370 
do i get a normal map or displacement
map<00:05:40.430> into<00:05:40.789> the<00:05:40.910> mix<00:05:41.120> and<00:05:41.389> i'll<00:05:41.930> show<00:05:42.020> you<00:05:42.139> that

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:42.380 
map into the mix and i'll show you that

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:44.710 
map into the mix and i'll show you that
next
