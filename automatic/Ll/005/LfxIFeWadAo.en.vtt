00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:10.680
 i 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.160
 very good here catÃ³n mv I bring you 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.320
 lecos movie the videogame to get 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.890
 the 5 golden instructions of the 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:28.770
 first phase the construction of the tribe 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:30.779
 the first mission of all we selected 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:32.730
 free game we choose one of the 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.100
 characters basically inside we can 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.710
 we can take the character we want 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.629
 next to the corresponding mission 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.870
 they will be colorful circles this way 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:45.629
 let's start we have all the plus 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.699
 activated so we will go super fast in 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.710
 this case I have chosen superman vale 

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:51.510
 let's go for the first instruction 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.750
 and for this we have to go to the 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:57.390
 right all we're breaking all 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:00.300
 these walls we lose the lock that 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.070
 is on this door with the lasers is 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.289
 open to see what we find then 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.270
 they are followed by some phases in an area 

00:01:04.289 --> 00:01:08.940
 secret good that secret thing between 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.160
 quotes we go to the right of the whole 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:14.009
 here are two instruction sheets 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:16.380
 golden good two books two notebooks or 

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:18.670
 how do you want to call it worth and so 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:22.060
 we handle our 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:23.500
 dear megan bad 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:26.770
 so you can see that free game if not 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:30.729
 we get full so story is 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:34.450
 completely a bit difficult that 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:38.810
 have this golden instruction here 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:41.780
 we have the first of the first phase 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:44.689
 and this one is inside the chest and it's not 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:47.210
 open we take it and we already have a 5 

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:51.610
 let's go for the second one that's right 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:53.440
 here too and burst the 11 houses 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:56.800
 that we will find that we have found 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:59.050
 so along the way so it 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:01.480
 We will do precisely with our beloved 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:03.280
 mega bad when we are finishing 

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:07.330
 look good when the last one breaks 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:09.280
 house 10 of 11 is a confines in the 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:13.000
 money there is 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:15.610
 2 of 5 perfect we go for the third to 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.670
 back to back we break the camera that 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:22.209
 there's just right here we already have a 5 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:24.190
 I'm not marked because I have activated the 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:26.860
 gold instruction detector 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:29.890
 golden guides here we will find the 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:32.830
 second 12 5 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:35.950
 and in this part we will find the third 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:37.870
 before getting the hammer 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:41.290
 massive destruction 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:43.870
 worth 3 out of 5 we keep moving forward in the 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:45.700
 phase we will find the 4 of 5 that this 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:48.099
 sign did not mark it down there we see it 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:50.319
 and was a little higher but you it 

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:52.659
 superman is superman but it's not for 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:54.970
 so much and here we will find the 5 of 5 and 

00:02:52.659 --> 00:02:57.069
 We have 3 of 5 golden instructions 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:59.739
 let's go for the fourth one that's right 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:02.440
 here and for that we would need the 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:05.110
 character of an equity that is to say me low 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:07.480
 Well, I'm getting off like he has not yet 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:11.950
 got the pneumatic hammer then 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:13.569
 everything is like half work we are not going to 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:15.430
 break this wall 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:17.769
 let's see if they remove the 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:19.750
 bricks and we already have four of five 

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:22.299
 golden instructions now let's go to 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:24.670
 for the last one there we are when we are 

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:27.190
 falling shows exact location 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:29.319
 we will see things that we saw at the beginning that 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:32.079
 you could not go to the right 

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:36.000
 once we click we give the button 

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:36.000
 marked and we go to the other side 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:43.560
 if we have the golden guide detector 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:45.629
 of golden instructions will not mark them 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:48.330
 with a white arrow so 

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:52.260
 locate it even easier 

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:54.240
 If I get everything, even if I do not 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:56.820
 I pay attention to those dates of events 

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:59.040
 me I see it here is there is 

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:01.530
 checked 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:04.120
 here it is very easy to see the arrow 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:09.870
 on the screen 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:12.180
 5 out of 5 guys and girls and this is it 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:14.310
 and here we have the 5 instructions 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:17.220
 Some will not know what it's for 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:19.609
 I say this is to build one 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:22.280
 of the vehicles in the rooms 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:27.150
 bonuses and others here I will show 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:30.330
 and here we are we are going to see a tractor already 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:32.820
 we can build it and start the 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:35.100
 only downside that I would put in this is that 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:36.590
 You can not be used outside the vehicle 

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:39.170
 living room 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:43.089
 at no stage are they here just to 

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:46.159
 show or play between multiplayer 

00:04:43.089 --> 00:04:47.749
 basically when it comes to building it 

00:04:46.159 --> 00:04:50.150
 also a bit more difficult 

00:04:47.749 --> 00:04:52.969
 found in the story mode and here 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:55.490
 we have them you can not handle what 

00:04:52.969 --> 00:04:59.659
 is the shovel tractor only the 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:05:02.240
 vehicle itself here we have it curious 

00:04:59.659 --> 00:05:05.360
 We still have 14 vehicles left to show 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:08.270
 and I will make a special video showing all 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:11.149
 together so they can enjoy it in 

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:13.999
 a single video and that's what all the 

00:05:11.149 --> 00:05:16.009
 gold guides and pants for 

00:05:13.999 --> 00:05:17.960
 unlock more vehicles than 

00:05:16.009 --> 00:05:20.960
 We will include in each guide and in a 

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:23.839
 concrete video after these guides 

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:25.520
 I'll put a video with all the 

00:05:23.839 --> 00:05:29.149
 pants with the 15 pants in a 

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:30.680
 just video so you can see its location and 

00:05:29.149 --> 00:05:32.419
 this is all I hope you have been 

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:33.979
 help if you liked to like 

00:05:32.419 --> 00:05:36.199
 subscribe if you are not and a great 

00:05:33.979 --> 00:05:38.749
 support on your part and if you have any 

00:05:36.199 --> 00:05:41.029
 doubt consult or want to put me any 

00:05:38.749 --> 00:05:41.389
 the comment I will answer you as soon as 

00:05:41.029 --> 00:05:43.879
 read 

00:05:41.389 --> 00:05:47.949
 yes i can hope to see you in the next 

00:05:43.879 --> 00:05:47.949
 video up guys and girls
