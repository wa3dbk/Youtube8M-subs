00:00:02.179 --> 00:00:07.500
 for the 10th anniversary of 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.599
 ratchet &amp; clank get on budget and 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.639
 robot clank next to the hd remake of the 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.500
 first three games now also one more 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.719
 new part for playstation 3 and wii 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.000
 the eu fonds embark on a journey 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:22.800
 through the galaxy around denies it 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.689
 also playfully directs new rules and 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.119
 clank yukos tells the story of 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:30.029
 former galactic president corp 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.619
 you heard right because former 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.510
 the good god has been during his 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.120
 last office so much done 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.520
 and therefore lost the re-elections 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.320
 now drives aimlessly and death 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.450
 bored with bradl to clegg through 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.850
 space because there is absolutely nothing to do 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.950
 is well till now because suddenly 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.600
 new super villain appeared and 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.149
 the galaxy crashes into chaos 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.649
 which soon turns out to be behind 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.660
 the mysterious villain 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.670
 disappointed fan of the captain of the now 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.620
 I will execute vengeance and that's it then 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.780
 already with story because in contrast to 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.969
 previous series parts await us 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.660
 the kiosk with a funny story 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.660
 exciting turns 

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:11.250
 who now hop on that series-typical 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.990
 Run because exploring solve puzzles 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.570
 and bends gather thinks the lies not 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.490
 quite right because the coupons remember 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.650
 more to an art tower defense than to 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.810
 a classic ratchet &amp; clank title 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.790
 we are still allowed to run and 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.170
 Ballers bounce and puzzle facades 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.250
 but they will be back 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.259
 past 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.400
 we also need our environment 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.900
 no longer exploring 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.880
 it is the core of the game 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.070
 our own base on one 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.229
 defend enemy planets if 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.430
 At the same time we try the basis of the 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.280
 driver's take 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.659
 and that works as follows first 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.729
 we have a few boxes and native ones 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:46.649
 thus remains were broadcom for 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.619
 then we buy signs and mines 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:51.149
 automatic bullets for our fortress 

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:53.340
 Next has us super stiletto 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:54.770
 stewart his minions on the neck the 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.880
 we with the help of the acquired 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:58.740
 defense equipment and our own 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.729
 firepower from our generators 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.900
 keep away 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.670
 because as soon as one 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:04.230
 Generators are destroyed is ours 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.480
 mission failed and hÃ¼fingen that 

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:08.460
 level again from the beginning we will 

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:10.229
 just not besieged by the enemy waves 

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:11.880
 it's time to fight back 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.920
 with the masses we in one 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.690
 Unlock mini game, we rely 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.610
 Alone the positions of the enemy 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.230
 Of course we will do it first 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.880
 what did it mean us the shield 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:23.520
 generators can destroy around 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:25.020
 finally taking the fortress 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:27.150
 is easier said than done 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:29.130
 every time we attack 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:31.650
 our fortress is unguarded 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:32.970
 because how can not gather enough wood 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.709
 for our defense so far 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.720
 to upgrade that you a complete 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:38.520
 we have to withstand attack alone 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.440
 if necessary, in the middle of the battle 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:42.000
 phoning around our own 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.010
 to defend generators 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.750
 Of course that will give the monster a new lease of life 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.790
 the opportunity to increase your numbers 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:50.010
 and start at the next counter strike 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:52.110
 we come back to zero above all else 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:54.270
 frustration in hectic devils 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:55.770
 and avoid frustration or moments 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:58.470
 at least reduce it 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:00.300
 We play best in the course locally or 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.930
 online we can do the campaign for two 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.910
 approach 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:04.830
 practically because so fight on two 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:07.470
 fronts at the same time and take in 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:09.150
 all a little the witch unfortunately brings 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:11.250
 a second player but not much 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.660
 more variety in the story mode because 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:14.640
 he actually consists of that always 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:16.380
 same work steps and as soon as we 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.790
 we finally managed to start 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:18.540
 on the next planet again 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:20.940
 from the front 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:22.709
 more tension brings the online mode 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:24.120
 here we either kick one against one 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:26.400
 or two against two 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:28.890
 in the same basis conquest games 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.269
 unlike the campaign is the 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:33.180
 compete here in three steps 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:34.980
 We are running around 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:38.430
 instead of in our personal weapons 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:40.560
 stock up on bolls club and get us 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:42.239
 buy conquered bolz print the 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.989
 we are in the position of our opponents 

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:44.790
 rush 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:46.709
 In addition, we best secure our 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:49.830
 own base with gunmen and shields 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:51.330
 and attacked the acquired troops of all 

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:52.920
 players are sent into the fight 

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:54.420
 and try the opponents 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:56.519
 destroying generators 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:59.310
 Here we either stay with ours 

00:03:56.519 --> 00:04:01.230
 base and defend or pull in 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:01.920
 the fight for the center of the opponent too 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:04.290
 to destroy 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:06.090
 unlike the campaign gets here 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:06.880
 the unpredictability of the players 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:11.230
 tension 

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:13.090
 expect as usual and 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:15.040
 brightly colorful worlds opponents in all 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:17.380
 Shapes and colors on imaginative 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:19.360
 designed planets most of the time 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:21.760
 we can enjoy that without hindrance 

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:24.340
 only in the local co- op mode does it happen 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:26.170
 a few times to considerable jerking 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:27.880
 fans, however, is solid now all 

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:30.190
 grown defective and good german 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:32.590
 speech output hold the usual high 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:34.510
 series standards which are on permanent terms though 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:36.190
 then they are annoying 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:38.350
 constantly repeating sayings of 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:45.610
 heroes and shows on the left and the one on 

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:47.350
 howling sirens in the back of his head 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:49.180
 tim klenke force does not count on the 

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:51.130
 the usual strengths of the will 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:52.930
 varied gameplay and funny 

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:54.880
 story and that's a pity 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:57.190
 At the beginning, the whole tower feels 

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:58.480
 defense was still new and exciting to 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:00.310
 but if you times the third 

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:02.410
 hostile generator in the same way 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:04.780
 off has contributes soon the 

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:06.580
 boredom too too if we have it here 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:07.690
 visually with a classic rod &amp; 

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:09.610
 clank have to do 

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:11.260
 he coupons the impression 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:12.970
 gap filler to the next correct one 

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:15.580
 serial part to be as one 

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:18.720
 independent successor not least 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:18.720
 because of the small size
