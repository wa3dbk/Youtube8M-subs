00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.870
 good afternoon, let's go down a little bit 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.870
 of silence 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:19.040
 good evening les enrique dane boronat 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:20.510
 sports 4 I would like to know if this is 

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:23.300
 the worst game of the season 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:24.650
 Barça despite the victory and if the team 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.810
 is playing what you want, Luis 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:31.160
 Enrique 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:32.920
 if the worst game in which game 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:34.780
 we have done 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:37.000
 it would be very easy for the maintainer to say 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:39.269
 who wants another game then I'm not going 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.269
 to say 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:52.820
 for Luis good afternoon coast adviser 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:55.219
 raku has asked so that we 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:57.379
 assess whether it is the influence of 

00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:59.839
 appearance of Luis Suarez on the canal 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:02.899
 living room temps work on the ground 

00:00:59.839 --> 00:01:04.640
 york and if you have the keys for the 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:07.420
 which the team dares so uncomfortable 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.420
 to the first part 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:13.350
 I do not have the keys and the keys 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:17.620
 there are parties in which the beginning of the 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:19.780
 pre apart and throughout the previous 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:21.640
 part we have not heard 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.470
 for different reasons counteract the 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:26.120
 almeria and you very locked in back as 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:29.450
 it is obvious looking 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:30.560
 looking for an against have had a couple of 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.370
 transitions in one of them have not been 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:36.430
 made a goal and that has increased 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:39.640
 has presented a little more the state 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:41.530
 our game and even soulish 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:44.290
 Y 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:47.020
 the second part was a little different 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:49.420
 no good game more for ambition more for 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:50.830
 attitude of the players and by intention 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:54.880
 of going around the game that because 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:57.659
 per game that's reality and that's what 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.659
 I've seen wearing party 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.090
 Well, Luis asked me 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:03.259
 right and this one of the chain be 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.030
 you say it has been the worst game of the 

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:06.259
 barça we would do it in season now 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:08.000
 well a break of selections or like that 

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:09.769
 time to reflect but the 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.060
 football evolution of the team is 

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:13.340
 at the point that you expected these 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:14.120
 seasonal heights that's very difficult 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.470
 value it 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.050
 I am analysis test in the last week 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:21.260
 or yesterday better said 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:23.390
 this is going to be a continuum 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.739
 improve things and see that in others what 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:28.700
 better so throughout the season 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:30.230
 it works like this there is not an exact point that 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.180
 can you tell us right now we are by 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:33.930
 above or below I'm sorry but I 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:35.969
 I do not have that 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.049
 mister good afternoon from the middle of 

00:02:35.969 --> 00:02:39.450
 almería congratulations for the victory 

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:40.799
 let's see the ideal daily gutierrez 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:43.859
 the question within those difficulties 

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:46.290
 that the party has generated around the 

00:02:43.859 --> 00:02:47.939
 victory of your team that influences 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:52.099
 under his point of view has been able to have 

00:02:47.939 --> 00:02:52.099
 the almería has surprised him long 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:57.480
 do not surprise him we knew that they are going to 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:59.500
 accumulate many men have been left 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.760
 space to go outside as they do the 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.560
 Most equipment as is evident 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.190
 when you close yourself near your goal 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:09.240
 and have searched for a strategy or play 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:09.240
 an action or the transition 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:13.010
 but now the few occasions that we have 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:14.780
 had the first part and his goal then 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:19.069
 it made it much more complicated 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:21.290
 match and in the second we have tried 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:23.450
 entry of players refresh and with 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:25.849
 different mechanisms can you make us 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:26.989
 with the game we have not done it to 

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:28.219
 through the game but through 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:29.959
 Sometimes we have had enough 

00:03:28.219 --> 00:03:31.760
 goal chances and we have been able to 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:34.340
 materialize two that make us 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:36.439
 let's take the match but it is clear that 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:38.590
 it's not for the things we've done 

00:03:36.439 --> 00:03:38.590
 wrong 

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:43.520
 here Luis Lendro churches of the sixth 

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:46.340
 first I wanted to ask you about a 

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:48.920
 valuation of the messi party and 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:51.600
 then if the right band does not see it a 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:56.090
 little bit more lost 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:58.080
 what question are you the 1 the 2 the 1 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:00.990
 assessment 

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:04.070
 right now I prefer to value what 

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:04.070
 and what the team is doing 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:07.319
 the individualities 

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:11.510
 they are below what a 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:14.510
 soccer team this is our 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:16.550
 situation we have to improve to 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:18.740
 recover our good football and our 

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:20.210
 football that characterizes us and continue 

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:22.810
 Earning points and keep winning matches 

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:22.810
 that goal 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:36.840
 by ricard torquemada of catalunya ràdio 

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:39.630
 to have experience in matches that 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:41.460
 it is through santani that the player notices 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:44.850
 that the sensations are not good 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:46.430
 carlos and trace those that importance 

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:49.280
 of parla 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:51.180
 for me basic basic that 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:52.979
 importance not 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:54.210
 to succeed long one season 

00:04:52.979 --> 00:04:56.340
 that win even the matches that 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:58.080
 play bad and has been one of them not 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:01.530
 we're going to hide it and we're going to 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:03.300
 disguise with excuses but have stuck 

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:05.460
 and have competition and be able to raise that 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:08.460
 kind of key parties throughout the 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:11.580
 season today in a very delicate moment 

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:13.889
 and with the difficulty that he has for us 

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:15.840
 that has made us pass to almeria fruit 

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:17.070
 of his good defensive work and fruit a 

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:20.729
 little also to our inaccuracies 

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:23.460
 continuous and the fact of not elaborating almost 

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:25.259
 No play with relative fluency makes 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:26.789
 that the parties and in this case this one 

00:05:25.259 --> 00:05:28.860
 complicate up to limits 

00:05:26.789 --> 00:05:30.810
 unsuspected the best but one of the 

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:33.000
 The best result is effective in the 

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:34.580
 last meters three sticks what what 

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.379
 we have given 

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:38.569
 well it's clear that we have a lot to 

00:05:36.379 --> 00:05:40.610
 improve and we are trying to make that happen 

00:05:38.569 --> 00:05:42.289
 produce as soon as possible if I 

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:43.849
 allows is a final question 

00:05:42.289 --> 00:05:46.460
 ask yourself about the alignment many 

00:05:43.849 --> 00:05:47.569
 weight changes many men within 

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:50.000
 team have been left out today I do not know 

00:05:47.569 --> 00:05:51.770
 to what extent does that excess change 

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.949
 rotations have been able to affect the game 

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:57.310
 the team you were looking for with so much change 

00:05:53.949 --> 00:05:57.310
 you never know 

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:01.040
 Whether it affects or not 

00:06:01.449 --> 00:06:04.259
 worthy
