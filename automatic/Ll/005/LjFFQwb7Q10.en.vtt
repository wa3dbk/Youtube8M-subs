00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:13.710
 this is the most common blue 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:16.880
 neon is seen yes how effectively it looks 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.880
 fisherman verst and 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:25.550
 next to them we see the pink building 

00:00:22.989 --> 00:00:29.890
 the ledges on the video us are not so bright 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:29.890
 looks like in reality 

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:38.809
 here everyone sees up to 100 liter aquarium 

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:44.239
 here order stadiums and here are pink 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:46.300
 Denmark excellent representatives atypical 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:51.280
 rather typical representative 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:54.280
 aquarium fish zebrafish 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.280
 original 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:00.820
 bright pink case for some reason bright 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:03.940
 illuminated 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:07.840
 but 2 how w 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:11.380
 here you are and 100 liter aquarium 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.380
 that's about 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:16.560
 I say about 100 nems 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:27.170
 that 20 to him are pink Americans 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:30.690
 crossed 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:32.870
 coral fishes were stalking the usual 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:36.990
 Denmark 

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:37.920
 It turned out such a pearl as 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:42.110
 coral 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.110
 pink color tribute 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:58.299
 continue on 100 liter aquarium 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:02.159
 flow simulation 

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:02.159
 he is creating 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:08.440
 it is not only the creation of calm 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.090
 states 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.330
 sometimes love to fight with the flow 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:16.100
 especially before him 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:20.360
 he really does not feed bread 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:20.360
 favorite topic throughout the year 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:37.920
 but here I also ask you to consider what you have 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.920
 relatively bright bottom 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:44.090
 Brown color 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:47.239
 so do not look so bright their pain 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:51.860
 means on a darker gray background 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:54.140
 they would look much brighter than light 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:59.390
 ponds in lighted windows always 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:03:06.640
 lighter no bright fish trying 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:06.640
 take color tone around the pastor 

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:14.140
 touched danil on this background 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:16.370
 seen for and although there is quite 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:19.270
 impressive amount in the background 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:19.270
 burst out 

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:44.620
 here we are changing the angle of lighting 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:47.470
 you can see how the fish begins to change 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:53.320
 your color 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:53.320
 yes here with this still looks bright cute 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:59.420
 you structure is actually a play of light and 

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:02.840
 the shadows. 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:05.260
 There are several options for highlighting 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:05.260
 do
