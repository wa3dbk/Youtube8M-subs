thinking about getting one or the other

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.830 
thinking about getting one or the other
and<00:02:58.460> although<00:02:59.460> this<00:02:59.670> is<00:02:59.910> a<00:02:59.970> little<00:03:00.120> bit

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
and although this is a little bit

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.260 
and although this is a little bit
chunkier<00:03:01.470> on<00:03:01.680> the<00:03:01.860> side

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:03.270 
chunkier on the side

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:05.090 
chunkier on the side
the<00:03:03.780> obviously<00:03:04.320> the<00:03:04.440> zippy<00:03:04.710> Quinn<00:03:04.890> purse

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.100 
the obviously the zippy Quinn purse

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:07.070 
the obviously the zippy Quinn purse
because<00:03:05.580> it<00:03:05.760> has<00:03:05.970> the<00:03:06.240> zipper<00:03:06.270> round<00:03:06.780> closure

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080 
because it has the zipper round closure

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.440 
because it has the zipper round closure
is<00:03:07.470> a<00:03:07.500> little<00:03:07.800> bit<00:03:07.920> smaller<00:03:08.250> but<00:03:08.850> definitely

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
is a little bit smaller but definitely

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:11.210 
is a little bit smaller but definitely
between<00:03:09.840> the<00:03:09.960> two<00:03:10.170> I<00:03:10.200> think<00:03:10.410> they<00:03:10.770> are<00:03:11.010> both

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
between the two I think they are both

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:14.000 
between the two I think they are both
great<00:03:11.580> pieces<00:03:11.880> and<00:03:12.650> extremely<00:03:13.650> comparable

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
great pieces and extremely comparable

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:18.230 
great pieces and extremely comparable
with<00:03:14.940> with<00:03:15.570> both<00:03:15.810> of<00:03:15.990> them<00:03:16.140> but<00:03:16.860> I<00:03:17.400> like<00:03:18.030> I<00:03:18.120> said

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:18.240 
with with both of them but I like I said

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:20.480 
with with both of them but I like I said
I<00:03:18.300> recommend<00:03:18.780> this<00:03:18.900> guy<00:03:19.140> I<00:03:19.440> opted<00:03:20.220> for<00:03:20.250> the

I recommend this guy I opted for the

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:22.850 
I recommend this guy I opted for the
Black<00:03:20.760> Caviar<00:03:21.030> leather<00:03:21.510> even<00:03:22.350> though<00:03:22.650> they<00:03:22.800> do

have<00:03:23.040> the<00:03:23.400> lambskin<00:03:23.940> just<00:03:24.300> because<00:03:24.630> I<00:03:24.660> have<00:03:25.050> a

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:25.080 
have the lambskin just because I have a

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:26.870 
have the lambskin just because I have a
few<00:03:25.410> pieces<00:03:25.620> that<00:03:26.010> are<00:03:26.100> multicolored<00:03:26.640> from

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
because lambskin tends to be a little

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.760
