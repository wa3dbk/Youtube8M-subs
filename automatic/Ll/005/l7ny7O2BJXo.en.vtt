00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:02.720
 if you are weak and unwilling 

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:05.130
 train then this is the first sign that u 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:06.549
 you overtraining 

00:00:06.549 --> 00:00:07.690
 what to do 

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:09.189
 you ask me 

00:00:09.189 --> 00:00:13.319
 Firstly, I advise you not to rest 5 

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:16.259
 give the body 

00:00:16.259 --> 00:00:18.390
 Kaliningrad recovery 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.279
 take a trip to nature that's how I'm sitting 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:22.480
 in this cafe 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.150
 in mind Volga rest 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:27.499
 so that the body does not stop 

00:00:27.499 --> 00:00:29.860
 or change occupation 

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:31.159
 let us suppose 

00:00:31.159 --> 00:00:34.940
 active lifestyle communication titan to the cottage 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:36.940
 do a little work there only 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:38.800
 Miheev physically 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.390
 exist 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:41.620
 m 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:44.000
 two types of overwork first 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.690
 physical stage 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.040
 when 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:49.740
 the body is physically tired of 

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:52.320
 it usually goes to recovery five 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.920
 days like i said 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.980
 but the worst is psychological 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:58.790
 overwork 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:00.720
 to restore it can 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:02.980
 take months there are half a year 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:06.280
 and to prevent this from happening to you 

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:09.080
 change lifestyle 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:11.180
 walk and but friends 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:12.400
 communicate 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:13.799
 with their 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.140
 relatives 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:16.750
 with parents 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:18.479
 and go to the country 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.100
 on nature 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:22.400
 to the beach 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:23.790
 winter ride 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.550
 while skiing as my friends do 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:27.659
 Often 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.210
 it will help you 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:30.740
 and avoid flooding 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.100
 the monotony of their workouts in 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.430
 gym husband is 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.360
 okay monotone 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:38.590
 everyday 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:40.970
 I mean training day 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:42.790
 same 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:44.350
 but because they are better 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:47.460
 second way to good recover action 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.920
 overwork is the third more 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.790
 liquids 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:53.280
 to the fullest 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.729
 water balance in the body and because 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:58.729
 this body is better to recover 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:01.930
 more effective way is guys 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:05.880
 procedures in the bath when you sit in the bath 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.890
 first good company just right away 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:11.270
 I want to say that should not be there 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:12.599
 Kiev 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:15.599
 you can drink some juice 

00:02:17.179 --> 00:02:20.389
 and then the parameters of f sometimes 

00:02:20.889 --> 00:02:23.269
 out of the body including 

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:25.169
 decomposition products 

00:02:25.169 --> 00:02:27.849
 and this is lactic acid when you 

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:30.759
 train you anaerobic load 

00:02:30.759 --> 00:02:32.989
 lactic acid accumulates in 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:35.469
 body and for this you just did 

00:02:35.469 --> 00:02:36.539
 fatigue 

00:02:36.539 --> 00:02:38.700
 reluctance to train 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.010
 so here it comes out just sports in 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:42.400
 mostly later 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:43.379
 when you 

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:44.949
 m 

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:47.609
 border guards either you can run 

00:02:47.609 --> 00:02:50.109
 jogging is worth adding too alas 

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:52.609
 plow or you have lactic acid 

00:02:52.609 --> 00:02:57.619
 it turned out rested if you charge at night 

00:02:57.619 --> 00:02:59.899
 energy vigor 

00:02:59.899 --> 00:03:02.909
 Another way is Rospatent Nutrition or 

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:05.459
 change a little bit and the food i'm not talking about 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:07.689
 tom to add more 

00:03:07.689 --> 00:03:10.040
 consumed products because 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:11.969
 if you work on the body no 

00:03:11.969 --> 00:03:14.859
 it will negate all your efforts to 

00:03:14.859 --> 00:03:17.239
 fat burning incitement 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:18.620
 more applications 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:21.049
 I advise of course sports nutrition on 

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:23.139
 board like any 

00:03:23.139 --> 00:03:24.309
 of vitamins 

00:03:24.309 --> 00:03:27.139
 but the most effective way i have it 

00:03:27.139 --> 00:03:28.849
 I do not recommend pan 

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:30.939
 because ko cannot be recommended 

00:03:30.939 --> 00:03:31.969
 this is a choice 

00:03:31.969 --> 00:03:32.989
 each 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:35.129
 but the most effective way 

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:37.859
 let's agree so I don't tell you about it 

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:40.639
 spoke and you didn't hear that chemistry then 

00:03:40.639 --> 00:03:43.010
 There are applications she hospital steroids 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:45.890
 but this is the most extreme case and here 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:46.999
 you decide 

00:03:46.999 --> 00:03:49.279
 apply it and not apply
