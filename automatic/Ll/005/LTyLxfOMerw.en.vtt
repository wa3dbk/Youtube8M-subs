00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 In this week's video I'll show you one 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:07.170
 very cool and very fun way to 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:09.210
 recycle soda cans and beyond 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.190
 you will need some 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.830
 tools you will see over 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:16.560
 video so be prepared for more 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:19.730
 a very crazy tutorial right after the 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.730
 sticker goes 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:30.510
 and for starters I'm going to remove the part of 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:32.430
 up and the bottom of the can and you 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.500
 is child does not forget to ask for help 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.500
 an adult because you can easily 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.800
 hurt when reporting the next can 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.900
 step will be to cut a strip measuring 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:48.420
 6.5 inches long by two 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:53.220
 wide and with the help of a pencil I 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:57.210
 I'll wrap one side of this strip and 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:59.390
 I'll model in the shape of a whistle and it will 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.920
 to be more or less this way here 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:03.930
 Now I will remember another small one. 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.360
 piece measuring 3 centimeters 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:09.300
 the length of two centimeters 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.909
 width and with the help of pliers I 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:15.620
 I need to do two small drugs in the 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.620
 largest part of this strip 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:29.149
 and put everything together leaving a small space 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:29.149
 half a centimeter in this part 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.899
 and now with the help of the treasure I will open 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.619
 a small gap between the body and the body 

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:39.619
 of the whistle 

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:51.020
 It is ready our where fast 

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:53.060
 made with can of soda and for 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.219
 make our pizza run enough 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:02:08.390
 hold the side panels, leaving the 

00:01:55.219 --> 00:02:10.310
 free top and blow with a 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:12.739
 little can you get that 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:15.290
 we make 314 whistles 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:17.030
 depends a lot on the size each one I 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:19.190
