any kind of an infestation of varroa
mites<00:00:26.340> which<00:00:26.519> is<00:00:26.699> one<00:00:26.820> of<00:00:26.910> the<00:00:26.970> big<00:00:27.119> things

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
mites which is one of the big things

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.099 
mites which is one of the big things
that<00:00:27.800> tends<00:00:28.800> to<00:00:28.949> destroy<00:00:29.550> honeybee<00:00:30.480> hives<00:00:30.660> so

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
that tends to destroy honeybee hives so

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:32.959 
that tends to destroy honeybee hives so
we<00:00:31.410> actually<00:00:31.859> pulled<00:00:32.160> our<00:00:32.279> bottom<00:00:32.610> board<00:00:32.820> out

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
we actually pulled our bottom board out

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.389 
we actually pulled our bottom board out
its<00:00:33.180> little<00:00:33.420> piece<00:00:33.570> of<00:00:33.719> corrugated<00:00:34.020> plastic

00:00:34.389 --> 00:00:34.399 
its little piece of corrugated plastic

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:37.280 
its little piece of corrugated plastic
that<00:00:35.399> serves<00:00:35.730> as<00:00:35.940> a<00:00:36.090> place<00:00:36.690> to<00:00:36.719> capture<00:00:37.020> the

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
that serves as a place to capture the

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:38.889 
that serves as a place to capture the
stuff<00:00:37.500> that<00:00:37.620> falls<00:00:37.770> out<00:00:38.010> of<00:00:38.040> the<00:00:38.190> hive<00:00:38.399> and

00:00:38.889 --> 00:00:38.899 
stuff that falls out of the hive and

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:41.209 
stuff that falls out of the hive and
this<00:00:39.899> treatment<00:00:40.350> here<00:00:40.710> which<00:00:40.860> has<00:00:40.980> been<00:00:41.129> in

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
this treatment here which has been in

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.580 
this treatment here which has been in
the<00:00:41.280> hive<00:00:41.430> for<00:00:41.640> two<00:00:41.790> weeks<00:00:42.059> produced<00:00:43.020> probably

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
the hive for two weeks produced probably

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.540 
the hive for two weeks produced probably
hundreds<00:00:44.070> of<00:00:44.190> thousands<00:00:45.059> of<00:00:46.309> varroa<00:00:47.309> mite

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
hundreds of thousands of varroa mite

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.000 
hundreds of thousands of varroa mite
carcasses<00:00:48.059> and<00:00:48.180> so<00:00:48.870> the<00:00:49.410> next<00:00:49.620> part<00:00:49.829> of<00:00:49.950> the

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
carcasses and so the next part of the

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.680 
carcasses and so the next part of the
treatment<00:00:50.190> is<00:00:50.430> doing<00:00:51.000> identically<00:00:51.480> what<00:00:51.600> we

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
treatment is doing identically what we

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:52.819 
treatment is doing identically what we
have<00:00:51.840> here<00:00:52.110> which<00:00:52.260> is<00:00:52.410> just<00:00:52.469> putting<00:00:52.710> on

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
have here which is just putting on

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.819 
have here which is just putting on
another<00:00:52.949> ten<00:00:53.340> with<00:00:54.300> the<00:00:54.449> formic<00:00:54.750> acid<00:00:54.870> the<00:00:56.449> the

00:00:57.819 --> 00:00:57.829 
another ten with the formic acid the the

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:02.479 
another ten with the formic acid the the
app<00:00:58.829> Agard<00:00:59.250> and<00:00:59.989> that's<00:01:00.989> about<00:01:01.170> it<00:01:01.320> and<00:01:01.710> what

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
app Agard and that's about it and what

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:03.529 
app Agard and that's about it and what
you're<00:01:02.609> looking<00:01:02.699> at<00:01:02.910> there<00:01:02.969> is<00:01:03.120> a<00:01:03.270> little

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
you're looking at there is a little

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.600 
you're looking at there is a little
spacer<00:01:03.960> that<00:01:04.260> keeps<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:04.680> top<00:01:05.070> box<00:01:05.339> with<00:01:05.519> the

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
spacer that keeps the top box with the

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.960 
spacer that keeps the top box with the
honey<00:01:05.729> and<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.060> brood<00:01:06.930> chamber<00:01:07.350> separate<00:01:07.970> and

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
honey and the brood chamber separate and

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.340 
honey and the brood chamber separate and
we<00:01:09.000> use<00:01:09.240> that<00:01:09.360> as<00:01:09.510> a<00:01:09.540> spacer<00:01:10.020> so<00:01:10.170> we<00:01:10.260> can

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
we use that as a spacer so we can

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:11.600 
we use that as a spacer so we can
actually<00:01:10.470> put<00:01:10.740> this<00:01:10.770> thing<00:01:11.070> in<00:01:11.130> there<00:01:11.430> and

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
actually put this thing in there and

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.660 
actually put this thing in there and
then<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:12.510> other<00:01:12.540> ones<00:01:12.840> are<00:01:12.960> just<00:01:13.400> these<00:01:14.400> guys

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.840 
all the foil off with the exception of
that<00:01:53.720> one<00:01:53.900> corner<00:01:54.320> lay<00:01:54.920> it<00:01:55.040> down<00:01:55.159> flat<00:01:55.490> make

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:55.850 
that one corner lay it down flat make

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.480 
that one corner lay it down flat make
sure<00:01:56.000> your<00:01:56.150> spacers<00:01:56.690> on<00:01:56.930> and<00:01:57.280> that's<00:01:58.280> pretty

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490 
sure your spacers on and that's pretty

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:00.100 
sure your spacers on and that's pretty
much<00:01:58.580> it<00:01:58.729> we'll<00:01:59.150> leave<00:01:59.360> it<00:01:59.450> on<00:01:59.510> for<00:01:59.570> two<00:01:59.870> weeks

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:00.110 
much it we'll leave it on for two weeks

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:03.340 
much it we'll leave it on for two weeks
and<00:02:00.920> then<00:02:01.600> that<00:02:02.600> should<00:02:02.810> be<00:02:02.960> good<00:02:03.080> to<00:02:03.140> go<00:02:03.229> for

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.350 
and then that should be good to go for

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:05.230 
and then that should be good to go for
the<00:02:03.650> winter<00:02:03.890> we'll<00:02:04.460> do<00:02:04.550> it<00:02:04.610> once<00:02:04.820> again<00:02:05.030> in<00:02:05.150> the

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.240 
the winter we'll do it once again in the

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:09.070 
the winter we'll do it once again in the
spring<00:02:05.979> with<00:02:06.979> one<00:02:07.340> dose<00:02:08.000> per<00:02:08.360> hive<00:02:08.570> for<00:02:08.929> two

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.080 
spring with one dose per hive for two

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:10.480 
spring with one dose per hive for two
weeks<00:02:09.289> and<00:02:09.530> then<00:02:09.619> the<00:02:09.679> second<00:02:10.009> dose<00:02:10.130> per<00:02:10.340> hive

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:10.490 
weeks and then the second dose per hive

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:13.030 
weeks and then the second dose per hive
for<00:02:10.729> two<00:02:10.880> weeks<00:02:11.090> and<00:02:11.500> that's<00:02:12.500> how<00:02:12.980> you

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
for two weeks and that's how you

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.550 
for two weeks and that's how you
medicate<00:02:13.459> the<00:02:13.580> hives<00:02:13.760> we<00:02:14.630> do<00:02:14.750> this<00:02:14.900> so<00:02:15.170> the

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
medicate the hives we do this so the

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.490 
medicate the hives we do this so the
varroa<00:02:15.800> mites<00:02:16.010> do<00:02:16.310> not<00:02:16.490> get<00:02:17.500> overpopulated

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
varroa mites do not get overpopulated

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:22.630 
varroa mites do not get overpopulated
and<00:02:18.920> pretty<00:02:19.550> much<00:02:21.070> becomes<00:02:22.070> very<00:02:22.459> detrimental

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
and pretty much becomes very detrimental

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.390 
and pretty much becomes very detrimental
to<00:02:23.000> the<00:02:23.270> colony<00:02:23.540> so<00:02:24.170> that's<00:02:24.560> using<00:02:24.890> medicine

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
to the colony so that's using medicine

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.390 
to the colony so that's using medicine
for<00:02:25.610> the<00:02:25.670> apple<00:02:25.910> guard<00:02:26.060> and<00:02:27.280> hopefully<00:02:28.280> this

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
for the apple guard and hopefully this

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.480 
for the apple guard and hopefully this
will<00:02:28.610> work<00:02:29.090> out<00:02:29.300> well
