00:00:13.979 --> 00:00:17.900
 This is a new step that will be released from mass production 

00:00:17.899 --> 00:00:20.899
 There is a statement of the series 

00:00:21.409 --> 00:00:24.519
 I would like to actually use eco-re from now 

00:00:27.499 --> 00:00:30.539
 I've shown how to publish and squirrel ceo 

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:33.680
 am during 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.140
 That center of gravity movement 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:37.770
 Counter weight 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.460
 I was built in 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:42.400
 Thanks to it 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.390
 Flight distance is lost 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:46.310
 Yeah it's Yappa 

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:47.609
 Load balance is 

00:00:47.609 --> 00:00:49.160
 Because it is good 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:50.550
 that 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.810
 To cast 

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:54.650
 That time of the day 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:55.730
 Climate attitude 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:59.180
 This is also very stable 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:01.620
 I threw in a cast now but 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.210
 I also think that it is something 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.500
 Thirty-two 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.500
 It is crowded as usual 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:13.920
 Many people who lead 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.340
 Right Grand Hall swing height 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.060
 It is stable 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:20.810
 I think from now on 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:22.540
 The ball is- 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:25.540
 Where there is a balance 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.960
 I think that you understand the manufacturing 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.960
 As a feature 

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:37.390
 When we let you make it wide, it seems that this part is excluded 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.500
 The effect is in that word 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.300
 The total amount is a little 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:45.600
 I want you to understand 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.600
 I will take you to Arima 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:53.960
 Even in the game I have not started 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.960
 I should speak 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:00.590
 How about 70 to 85 degrees 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.080
 That the other now 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.080
 Let me start that much German from Mac 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:11.940
 The point is that the power of the point research is high 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.329
 Let me do a little 

00:02:13.329 --> 00:02:15.709
 I will share that 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:18.709
 Next time you dive 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:22.069
 The next action that dives on the process of diving 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:26.209
 When it comes to that bad Baba open gate comes up 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:28.599
 It is said that speed is fast 

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:30.199
 At that time 

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:31.589
 that 

00:02:31.589 --> 00:02:35.939
 Take advantage of the speed of speed and the height of persuasiveness 

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:38.969
 It was when the country was done 

00:02:38.969 --> 00:02:40.849
 That pitch 

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:43.059
 It is power when we switch 

00:02:43.059 --> 00:02:46.059
 I'm going to make it a little longer, revival splash 

00:02:47.309 --> 00:02:50.319
 I heard that it was busy 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:53.319
 Try 

00:02:54.789 --> 00:02:57.389
 You use the coach 

00:02:57.389 --> 00:03:00.389
 I let it splash 

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:05.129
 Make a little stronger while united 

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:07.709
 I made it a little stronger when I finished it 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:09.779
 It is after snow 

00:03:09.779 --> 00:03:13.119
 Let me start watering with bogey. 

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:18.799
 I guess this is a remarkable characteristic movement 

00:03:21.149 --> 00:03:24.169
 Receiving mail is a seed 

00:03:24.169 --> 00:03:26.649
 Although Uri party is attached 

00:03:26.649 --> 00:03:29.179
 On top of that 

00:03:29.179 --> 00:03:31.549
 I'm Futaba 

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:34.549
 Name one is already full high performance 

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:38.379
 Another ball for moving the center of gravity 

00:03:40.219 --> 00:03:42.509
 Slide up to now 

00:03:42.509 --> 00:03:44.259
 Add balance 

00:03:44.259 --> 00:03:47.259
 I have friends, but it's directly related 

00:03:51.369 --> 00:03:53.919
 I do not know if I can get it by voice 

00:03:53.919 --> 00:03:57.139
 I'm a public I also finished small round 2 in the middle of 81 yen 

00:03:57.909 --> 00:04:01.129
 Here and there, metals 

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:04.129
 With tick 

00:04:08.779 --> 00:04:11.789
 This is great when it suits you 

00:04:11.789 --> 00:04:14.789
 Appealing ability is high 

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:20.220
 Kobe Port with the Most Invisible State 

00:04:21.819 --> 00:04:24.199
 Also in terms of creating a region 

00:04:24.199 --> 00:04:27.199
 This is effective 

00:04:29.249 --> 00:04:32.249
 The stable one corrected 

00:04:37.939 --> 00:04:40.860
 55 minutes clean 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:43.909
 And the metal scion 

00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:46.909
 It is this tone that metal can go around 

00:04:48.539 --> 00:04:50.139
 And this 

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:53.139
 This splash with good buoyancy 

00:04:56.689 --> 00:04:58.749
 I have to make a book but
