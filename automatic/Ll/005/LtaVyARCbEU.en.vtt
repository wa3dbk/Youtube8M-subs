00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
then again figure any wider then widen

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:17.259 
then again figure any wider then widen
the<00:02:15.980> bike<00:02:16.160> in<00:02:16.310> it<00:02:16.400> becomes<00:02:16.670> a<00:02:16.819> bit<00:02:16.940> of<00:02:16.970> a<00:02:17.060> pain

00:02:17.259 --> 00:02:17.269 
the bike in it becomes a bit of a pain

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:19.180 
the bike in it becomes a bit of a pain
in<00:02:17.360> the<00:02:17.420> ass

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
in the ass

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:21.420 
in the ass
apart<00:02:19.970> from<00:02:20.030> that<00:02:20.180> it's<00:02:20.420> a<00:02:20.660> pretty<00:02:21.140> good

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
apart from that it's a pretty good

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:26.229 
apart from that it's a pretty good
comfort<00:02:22.430> wise<00:02:22.580> it<00:02:22.850> seems<00:02:23.000> to<00:02:23.120> be<00:02:24.160> fine<00:02:25.239> it's

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:26.239 
comfort wise it seems to be fine it's

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:27.490 
comfort wise it seems to be fine it's
quite<00:02:26.450> a<00:02:26.480> narrow<00:02:26.660> seat<00:02:26.959> at<00:02:27.019> the<00:02:27.080> front<00:02:27.110> but

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
quite a narrow seat at the front but

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:28.600 
quite a narrow seat at the front but
that<00:02:27.590> makes<00:02:27.739> it<00:02:27.920> easier<00:02:28.250> for<00:02:28.280> people<00:02:28.430> to

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610 
that makes it easier for people to

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:29.259 
that makes it easier for people to
shorter

00:02:29.259 --> 00:02:29.269 
shorter

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:31.960 
shorter
I<00:02:29.299> don't<00:02:30.140> struggle<00:02:30.290> I'm<00:02:30.739> six<00:02:31.010> foot<00:02:31.160> but<00:02:31.880> then

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
I don't struggle I'm six foot but then

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:34.630 
I don't struggle I'm six foot but then
it's<00:02:32.150> not<00:02:32.269> cramped<00:02:32.780> either<00:02:33.430> it's<00:02:34.430> not<00:02:34.519> a

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
it's not cramped either it's not a

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.610 
it's not cramped either it's not a
cramped<00:02:34.910> bike<00:02:35.060> and<00:02:36.019> the<00:02:36.110> other<00:02:36.230> she<00:02:36.410> taller

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
cramped bike and the other she taller

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.000 
cramped bike and the other she taller

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
than my next a six saddle so it feels

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:44.949 
than my next a six saddle so it feels
taller<00:02:40.340> she's<00:02:40.970> a<00:02:41.260> no<00:02:42.260> bad<00:02:42.440> thing<00:02:42.709> for<00:02:42.829> me<00:02:43.959> let's

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:44.959 
taller she's a no bad thing for me let's

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:47.180 
taller she's a no bad thing for me let's
go

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190

all right second gear and the front

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:57.330 
all right second gear and the front
wheel<00:02:52.350> started<00:02:52.800> skipping<00:02:53.010> now<00:02:53.420> quite<00:02:54.420> readily

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:00.330 

one<00:02:58.239> of<00:02:58.300> the<00:02:58.390> best<00:02:58.569> things<00:02:58.780> about<00:02:58.840> it<00:02:59.340> for

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
one of the best things about it for

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:04.020 
one of the best things about it for
cruising<00:03:00.760> sixth<00:03:01.750> gear<00:03:01.930> is<00:03:02.340> really<00:03:03.340> quite<00:03:04.000> a

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
cruising sixth gear is really quite a

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:07.650 
cruising sixth gear is really quite a
long<00:03:04.239> ratio<00:03:04.950> and<00:03:05.950> that<00:03:05.980> means<00:03:06.340> that<00:03:06.670> it's

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:07.660 
long ratio and that means that it's

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:10.589 
long ratio and that means that it's
cruising<00:03:08.410> I'm<00:03:08.680> at<00:03:08.860> 16<00:03:09.280> our<00:03:09.430> knees<00:03:09.760> do<00:03:09.970> 4,000

reps
and<00:03:13.040> the<00:03:13.190> smartest<00:03:13.459> being<00:03:13.700> a<00:03:13.849> small<00:03:14.060> twin

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:14.330 
and the smartest being a small twin

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:19.010 
and the smartest being a small twin
it'll<00:03:14.690> cruise<00:03:15.040> nicely<00:03:16.040> really<00:03:16.489> nicely

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:19.020

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:32.640 
there's no wind protection but you can

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:33.770 
there's no wind protection but you can
remember<00:03:32.760> do<00:03:32.970> that<00:03:33.090> with<00:03:33.210> a<00:03:33.240> screen<00:03:33.600> or

remember do that with a screen or
whatever<00:03:33.900> yes<00:03:34.230> what<00:03:34.380> I<00:03:34.410> do<00:03:34.590> with<00:03:34.710> it<00:03:34.830> there's<00:03:35.310> a

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
whatever yes what I do with it there's a

whatever yes what I do with it there's a
naked<00:03:35.520> bike<00:03:35.850> it's<00:03:36.060> never<00:03:36.240> going<00:03:36.390> to<00:03:36.450> have<00:03:36.600> wind

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
naked bike it's never going to have wind

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:38.150 
naked bike it's never going to have wind
affects<00:03:37.020> marine<00:03:37.200> protection<00:03:37.560> accessible<00:03:38.070> it

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
affects marine protection accessible it

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:42.020 
affects marine protection accessible it
is<00:03:38.360> so<00:03:39.590> yeah<00:03:40.590> it<00:03:40.770> really<00:03:41.370> does<00:03:41.580> do<00:03:41.760> a<00:03:41.790> bit<00:03:41.940> of

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
is so yeah it really does do a bit of

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:45.850 
is so yeah it really does do a bit of
everything

I<00:04:21.060> like<00:04:21.270> the<00:04:22.080> rear<00:04:22.260> brake<00:04:22.440> there<00:04:22.590> was<00:04:22.710> actually

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:22.950 
I like the rear brake there was actually

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:26.810 
I like the rear brake there was actually
really<00:04:23.190> strong<00:04:23.520> so<00:04:24.770> yeah<00:04:25.800> it<00:04:26.340> stops<00:04:26.640> long

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:26.820 
really strong so yeah it stops long

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:30.170 
really strong so yeah it stops long
enough<00:04:27.000> it's<00:04:27.270> so<00:04:27.360> light<00:04:27.570> it<00:04:27.750> doesn't<00:04:27.870> matter

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:30.180 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:32.060 

just<00:04:30.870> like<00:04:31.050> a<00:04:31.080> bit<00:04:31.289> more<00:04:31.380> initial<00:04:31.620> bite<00:04:31.800> that

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:32.070 
just like a bit more initial bite that

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:36.950 
just like a bit more initial bite that
might<00:04:32.250> just<00:04:32.370> be<00:04:32.400> me<00:04:32.610> so<00:04:33.470> yeah<00:04:35.660> I'm<00:04:36.660> going<00:04:36.900> to

bike<00:06:15.930> as<00:06:16.110> I<00:06:16.199> said<00:06:16.380> but<00:06:17.220> there's<00:06:17.430> quite<00:06:17.550> a<00:06:17.580> few

00:06:17.689 --> 00:06:17.699 
bike as I said but there's quite a few

00:06:17.699 --> 00:06:18.770 
bike as I said but there's quite a few
parts<00:06:17.880> near<00:06:18.150> that<00:06:18.240> have<00:06:18.330> been<00:06:18.479> from<00:06:18.659> other

parts near that have been from other

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:20.450 
parts near that have been from other
bikes<00:06:19.020> so<00:06:19.919> you<00:06:19.949> know<00:06:20.099> they're<00:06:20.190> going<00:06:20.280> to<00:06:20.340> work
