00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:12.150
 I will make a delicious sweet recipe 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:16.320
 so - called biscuits savoiardi I am 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:17.699
 of very light biscuits and at the same 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.320
 very good time 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:23.160
 then as ingredients for these 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:25.949
 biscuits we need two eggs 50 grams of 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:30.300

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:32.160

 a pinch of salt and sugar a 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.210
 veil to use after we go to see 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.680
 immediately the proceedings 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:45.559
 then as the first step we must 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.559
 separate the egg whites from the yolks 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:04.930
 add to the egg whites a pinch of 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:07.330
 salt and whisk the egg whites until stiff 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:08.770
 as we assemble our egg whites 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:10.869
 we add that they have a plan there 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:13.470
 sugar first the white sugar and then 

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:13.470
 icing sugar 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:28.220
 we continue adding the sugar to 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:28.220
 veil 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:57.000
 once the egg whites are stiff and 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:01.240
 they are whipped egg whites when 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:04.890
 turning them upside down they don't fall ok 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.890
 here they are put aside 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:11.640
 take our two yolks with one 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:23.739
 whip of this type ii flap 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:26.140
 simply with a spoon 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:35.200
 slowly add the egg whites 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:37.319
 yolks and with the brush we continue to 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.319
 turn 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.209
 we continue to add souls 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:03:24.330
 and let's continue to turn we all put 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.330
 egg whites 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:34.960
 we continue to mix everything well 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:43.570
 point we combine the potato starch to 

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:47.400
 we mix together flour and ne 

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:47.400
 we sift over the dough 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:15.420
 we amalgamate well amalgamate 

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:20.060
 all well until you get a 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:20.060
 beautifully worked and creamy dough 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:26.460
 I forgot to tell you as always that I 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:29.520
 I have already lit in the oven at 170 degrees in 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:33.810
 ventilated mode once obtained a 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:35.900
 beautifully creamy and well-worked dough and 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:38.100
 you always notice it from the bubbles 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:41.750
 that should make a dough well 

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:45.300
 processed take a baking sheet 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:48.750
 like this a pan and put on 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:50.880
 a sheet of parchment paper with the help of 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:55.470
 a sac Ã  poche or a bag from 

00:04:50.880 --> 00:05:01.050
 pastry chef and with the spout more 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:05:03.570
 little boy we do this here 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:07.110
 about 10 strips in length 

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:09.199
 centimeters and a centimeter thickness e 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:09.199
 half 

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:55.380
 let's proceed like this until we do 

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:55.380
 let's finish the dough 

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:51.710
 once they are not cookies they are 

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:54.970
 ready before firing them I saw 

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:54.970
 sprinkle with icing sugar 

00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:34.190
 and we put them in the oven for about 12 

00:07:30.530 --> 00:07:37.970
 from eight to twelve minutes here here 

00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:41.470
 cookies ready or just added a 

00:07:37.970 --> 00:07:44.210
 little bit of icing sugar on and 

00:07:41.470 --> 00:07:46.040
