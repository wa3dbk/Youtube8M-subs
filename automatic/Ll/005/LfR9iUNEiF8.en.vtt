00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:52.020 
we're going to have the username and

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:54.620 
we're going to have the username and
password<00:03:52.080> of<00:03:52.830> that<00:03:53.040> website<00:03:53.300> so<00:03:54.300> to<00:03:54.360> do<00:03:54.600> that

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:54.630 
password of that website so to do that

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:58.660 
password of that website so to do that
you<00:03:55.020> need<00:03:55.170> to<00:03:55.230> go<00:03:55.470> to<00:03:55.530> a<00:03:56.570> password<00:03:57.570> generator

00:03:58.660 --> 00:03:58.670 
you need to go to a password generator

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:01.010 
you need to go to a password generator
so<00:03:59.670> here's<00:03:59.880> a<00:03:59.940> website<00:04:00.480> which<00:04:00.720> has<00:04:00.840> got<00:04:00.990> a

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:01.020 
so here's a website which has got a

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:03.710 
so here's a website which has got a
password<00:04:01.530> generator<00:04:01.560> it's<00:04:02.340> called<00:04:02.720> wwhd

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720 
password generator it's called wwhd

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:08.210 
password generator it's called wwhd
access<00:04:04.440> tools<00:04:04.740> comm<00:04:05.990> /ht<00:04:06.990> password<00:04:07.710> generator

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220 
access tools comm /ht password generator

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:12.380 
access tools comm /ht password generator
so<00:04:09.150> I<00:04:09.180> put<00:04:09.600> a<00:04:10.110> name<00:04:10.980> of<00:04:11.130> a<00:04:11.280> username

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:12.390 
so I put a name of a username

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:15.620 
so I put a name of a username
let's<00:04:13.020> put<00:04:13.260> student<00:04:13.860> let's<00:04:14.700> pull<00:04:15.120> it<00:04:15.330> and

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:15.630 
let's put student let's pull it and

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:18.590 
let's put student let's pull it and
guest<00:04:16.440> or<00:04:16.830> something<00:04:17.250> so<00:04:18.239> that's<00:04:18.420> the

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:18.600 
guest or something so that's the

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:22.000 
guest or something so that's the
username<00:04:19.140> and<00:04:19.410> let's<00:04:19.890> make<00:04:20.130> the<00:04:20.280> password

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:22.010 
username and let's make the password

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:27.740 
username and let's make the password
apple<00:04:25.040> and<00:04:26.040> when<00:04:26.190> I<00:04:26.250> say<00:04:26.430> create<00:04:26.820> dot<00:04:27.240> HT

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:27.750 
apple and when I say create dot HT

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:32.300 
apple and when I say create dot HT
password<00:04:28.320> file<00:04:29.930> so<00:04:30.930> there<00:04:31.350> it's<00:04:31.590> created<00:04:32.190> the

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:32.310 
password file so there it's created the

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:34.490 
password file so there it's created the
file<00:04:32.580> so<00:04:33.240> basically<00:04:33.630> what<00:04:33.840> I<00:04:33.870> want<00:04:34.140> to<00:04:34.260> have<00:04:34.380> to
