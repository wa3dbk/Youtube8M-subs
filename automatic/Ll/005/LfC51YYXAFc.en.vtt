cruising<00:00:45.170> is<00:00:45.320> for<00:00:45.680> me<00:00:45.860> personally<00:00:46.250> it's<00:00:47.030> the

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:47.180 
cruising is for me personally it's the

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:50.229 
cruising is for me personally it's the
way<00:00:47.300> to<00:00:47.360> go<00:00:47.630> I<00:00:47.900> have<00:00:48.590> a<00:00:48.680> friend<00:00:49.040> he<00:00:49.250> prefers<00:00:49.670> the

00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:50.239 
way to go I have a friend he prefers the

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:51.910 
way to go I have a friend he prefers the
Royal<00:00:50.720> because<00:00:51.140> of<00:00:51.230> the<00:00:51.320> food<00:00:51.560> and<00:00:51.860> the

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:51.920 
Royal because of the food and the

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.310 
Royal because of the food and the
service<00:00:52.000> but<00:00:53.000> the<00:00:53.180> food<00:00:53.390> in<00:00:53.600> my<00:00:53.810> opinion<00:00:54.170> is

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:54.320 
service but the food in my opinion is

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.069 
service but the food in my opinion is
equal<00:00:54.739> to<00:00:55.010> that<00:00:55.130> of<00:00:55.310> royal<00:00:55.600> the<00:00:56.600> service<00:00:56.930> is

00:00:57.069 --> 00:00:57.079 
equal to that of royal the service is

00:00:57.079 --> 00:00:58.299 
equal to that of royal the service is
not<00:00:57.230> because<00:00:57.710> there's<00:00:57.920> no<00:00:58.130> economic

00:00:58.299 --> 00:00:58.309 
not because there's no economic

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:00.610 
not because there's no economic
incentive<00:00:58.760> because<00:00:59.300> they<00:00:59.570> pool<00:00:59.840> the<00:01:00.020> tips<00:01:00.320> in

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:00.620 
incentive because they pool the tips in

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:03.459 
incentive because they pool the tips in
Norwegian<00:01:01.579> but<00:01:02.329> I'm<00:01:02.809> not<00:01:02.930> really<00:01:03.110> all<00:01:03.410> that
