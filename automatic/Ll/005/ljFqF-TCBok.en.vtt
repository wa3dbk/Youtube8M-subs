00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.150 

basically<00:00:13.330> it's<00:00:13.420> a<00:00:13.480> 3d<00:00:13.840> zoetrope<00:00:14.350> sink<00:00:14.950> to<00:00:15.040> the

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:15.160 
basically it's a 3d zoetrope sink to the

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:16.980 
basically it's a 3d zoetrope sink to the
strobe<00:00:15.430> light<00:00:15.700> every<00:00:16.359> one<00:00:16.510> of<00:00:16.600> these<00:00:16.660> swimmers

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:16.990 
strobe light every one of these swimmers

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:19.260 
strobe light every one of these swimmers
is<00:00:17.230> in<00:00:17.380> sequence<00:00:17.859> there's<00:00:18.400> ten<00:00:18.640> doing<00:00:19.000> a<00:00:19.090> left

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:19.270 
is in sequence there's ten doing a left

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:22.830 
is in sequence there's ten doing a left
stroke<00:00:19.630> ten<00:00:20.200> doing<00:00:20.440> a<00:00:20.530> right<00:00:20.710> stroke<00:00:21.070> and<00:00:21.840> each

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:22.840 
stroke ten doing a right stroke and each

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:24.330 
stroke ten doing a right stroke and each
one<00:00:23.050> has<00:00:23.080> a<00:00:23.530> certain<00:00:23.860> point<00:00:24.010> the<00:00:24.190> light

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:24.340 
one has a certain point the light

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:26.340 
one has a certain point the light
flashes<00:00:24.970> then<00:00:25.510> when<00:00:25.660> it<00:00:25.690> gets<00:00:25.840> going<00:00:26.050> fast

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:26.350 
flashes then when it gets going fast

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:27.810 
flashes then when it gets going fast
enough<00:00:26.500> and<00:00:26.800> creates<00:00:27.130> the<00:00:27.190> illusion<00:00:27.430> of<00:00:27.670> it

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:27.820 
enough and creates the illusion of it

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:30.090 
enough and creates the illusion of it
all<00:00:27.940> swimming<00:00:28.750> away<00:00:28.869> from<00:00:29.199> the<00:00:29.320> center<00:00:29.650> it's

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:30.100 
all swimming away from the center it's

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:45.650 
all swimming away from the center it's
not<00:00:30.250> really<00:00:30.490> going<00:00:30.640> anywhere

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:01:03.540 

just<00:00:46.660> shake<00:00:46.989> it<00:00:47.020> wrong

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:03.550 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:11.420 

incredible<00:01:04.550> days<00:01:05.240> off

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.700 

oh<00:01:11.490> yeah<00:01:12.480> I<00:01:12.540> do<00:01:12.690> this<00:01:12.840> this<00:01:13.020> thing<00:01:13.080> like<00:01:13.530> oh

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
oh yeah I do this this thing like oh

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.620 
oh yeah I do this this thing like oh
yeah<00:01:13.860> I<00:01:13.920> needs<00:01:14.160> to<00:01:14.220> be<00:01:14.280> computer<00:01:14.790> control<00:01:15.330> for

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
yeah I needs to be computer control for

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.450 
yeah I needs to be computer control for
the<00:01:15.720> strobe<00:01:16.020> I'm<00:01:16.170> like<00:01:16.290> I<00:01:16.680> think<00:01:17.220> there's<00:01:17.370> a

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
the strobe I'm like I think there's a

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.940 
the strobe I'm like I think there's a
lower<00:01:17.700> tech<00:01:18.060> way<00:01:18.270> to<00:01:18.330> do<00:01:18.480> with<00:01:18.630> that<00:01:18.660> so<00:01:19.650> until

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
lower tech way to do with that so until

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.830 
lower tech way to do with that so until
that<00:01:19.980> night<00:01:20.370> when<00:01:20.580> I<00:01:20.610> crank<00:01:20.940> that<00:01:21.090> fucker<00:01:21.390> up<00:01:21.630> I

you just seeing the head come through

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:04.790 
you just seeing the head come through
and<00:02:03.630> as<00:02:03.780> it<00:02:03.899> comes<00:02:04.080> through<00:02:04.140> its<00:02:04.350> going<00:02:04.470> to<00:02:04.590> do

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:04.800 
and as it comes through its going to do

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:06.859 
and as it comes through its going to do
a<00:02:04.830> swan<00:02:05.250> dive<00:02:05.280> with<00:02:05.700> Edmund<00:02:06.060> dive<00:02:06.240> right

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
a swan dive with Edmund dive right

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:07.999 
a swan dive with Edmund dive right
through<00:02:07.080> the<00:02:07.140> ground<00:02:07.350> and<00:02:07.530> splashed<00:02:07.830> through

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
through the ground and splashed through

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.919 
through the ground and splashed through
flames<00:02:08.520> under<00:02:08.880> the<00:02:09.060> ground<00:02:09.209> so<00:02:09.600> I'm<00:02:09.690> doing<00:02:09.810> a

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
flames under the ground so I'm doing a

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.290 
flames under the ground so I'm doing a
cast<00:02:10.229> of<00:02:10.470> the<00:02:10.560> guy<00:02:10.739> full<00:02:11.009> body<00:02:11.220> cast<00:02:11.520> and<00:02:11.880> then

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
cast of the guy full body cast and then

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.060 
cast of the guy full body cast and then
I'm<00:02:12.540> putting<00:02:12.720> latex<00:02:13.200> and<00:02:13.440> then<00:02:13.590> foam<00:02:13.890> them

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:14.070 
I'm putting latex and then foam them

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:15.710 
I'm putting latex and then foam them
inside<00:02:14.520> that<00:02:14.760> so<00:02:14.970> then<00:02:15.090> you<00:02:15.180> tear<00:02:15.420> off<00:02:15.450> the

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
inside that so then you tear off the

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:16.789 
inside that so then you tear off the
plaster<00:02:16.140> and<00:02:16.230> you<00:02:16.290> have<00:02:16.380> a<00:02:16.440> much<00:02:16.590> more

00:02:16.789 --> 00:02:16.799 
plaster and you have a much more

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:18.680 
plaster and you have a much more
realistic<00:02:17.100> looking<00:02:17.519> she's<00:02:18.180> kind<00:02:18.570> of<00:02:18.630> like

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
realistic looking she's kind of like

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:22.460 
realistic looking she's kind of like
what<00:02:19.230> that<00:02:19.380> ass<00:02:20.720> does<00:02:21.720> this<00:02:21.900> is<00:02:22.080> so<00:02:22.290> it's<00:02:22.380> going

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
what that ass does this is so it's going

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.400 
what that ass does this is so it's going
