00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
stance where Nintendo is but I was

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.249 
stance where Nintendo is but I was
predicting<00:01:31.880> since<00:01:32.880> before<00:01:33.060> the<00:01:33.630> wii<00:01:33.840> u<00:01:34.079> was

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.030 
predicting since before the wii u was
even<00:01:34.650> dropped<00:01:35.490> that<00:01:36.000> this<00:01:36.900> this<00:01:37.380> console<00:01:37.829> will

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
even dropped that this this console will

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.230 
even dropped that this this console will
be<00:01:38.250> a<00:01:38.549> dub<00:01:39.509> like<00:01:40.110> failure<00:01:41.040> it's<00:01:41.850> gonna<00:01:42.030> be<00:01:42.150> an

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
absolute failure because Nintendo

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.359
