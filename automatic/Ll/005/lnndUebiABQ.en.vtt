Nintendo version can the machine even
handle<00:00:27.980> a<00:00:28.039> game<00:00:28.250> like<00:00:28.460> this

00:00:39.369 --> 00:00:39.379 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:41.869 

the<00:00:40.379> first<00:00:40.620> problem<00:00:40.950> in<00:00:41.190> bringing<00:00:41.520> this<00:00:41.670> game

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
the first problem in bringing this game

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.150 
the first problem in bringing this game
to<00:00:42.030> the<00:00:42.120> NES<00:00:42.570> is<00:00:42.840> that<00:00:43.290> the<00:00:43.379> controller<00:00:43.800> is<00:00:44.010> not

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
to the NES is that the controller is not

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.850 
to the NES is that the controller is not
well-suited<00:00:44.430> for<00:00:44.850> it<00:00:45.150> in<00:00:45.329> the<00:00:46.020> arcade<00:00:46.470> you<00:00:46.500> had

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
well-suited for it in the arcade you had

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.979 
well-suited for it in the arcade you had
one<00:00:47.100> stick<00:00:47.400> for<00:00:47.640> moving<00:00:47.820> and<00:00:48.090> one<00:00:48.510> stick<00:00:48.780> for

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
one stick for moving and one stick for

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.439 
one stick for moving and one stick for
shooting<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:50.190> NES<00:00:50.610> controller<00:00:51.059> does<00:00:51.269> not

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
shooting the NES controller does not

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.290 
shooting the NES controller does not
seem<00:00:51.750> capable<00:00:52.260> of<00:00:52.350> mimicking<00:00:52.830> bet<00:00:53.150> but<00:00:54.150> the

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
seem capable of mimicking bet but the

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.000 
seem capable of mimicking bet but the
developers<00:00:54.900> figured<00:00:55.290> out<00:00:55.470> a<00:00:55.500> way<00:00:55.650> to<00:00:55.680> make<00:00:55.949> it

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
developers figured out a way to make it

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.790 
developers figured out a way to make it
work<00:00:56.339> you<00:00:56.610> take<00:00:57.089> two<00:00:57.360> controllers<00:00:57.900> turn<00:00:58.589> them

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
work you take two controllers turn them

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.979 
work you take two controllers turn them
sideways<00:00:59.040> and<00:00:59.610> hold<00:01:00.030> them<00:01:00.180> up<00:01:00.300> so<00:01:00.570> your<00:01:00.690> thumbs

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
sideways and hold them up so your thumbs

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.210 
sideways and hold them up so your thumbs
are<00:01:01.199> on<00:01:01.230> the<00:01:01.440> d-pad

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:02.220 
are on the d-pad

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:04.160 
are on the d-pad
now<00:01:02.730> you<00:01:02.790> essentially<00:01:03.329> have<00:01:03.570> a<00:01:03.600> twin<00:01:03.930> stick

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
now you essentially have a twin stick

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.100 
now you essentially have a twin stick
control<00:01:04.680> scheme<00:01:05.009> it<00:01:05.729> works<00:01:06.000> very<00:01:06.360> well<00:01:06.509> and<00:01:06.930> it

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
control scheme it works very well and it

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.410 
control scheme it works very well and it
feels<00:01:07.380> so<00:01:07.649> unique<00:01:08.039> that<00:01:08.310> it's<00:01:08.759> probably<00:01:09.030> worth

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
feels so unique that it's probably worth

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.910 
feels so unique that it's probably worth
owning<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:09.990> game<00:01:10.200> just<00:01:10.530> experience<00:01:11.190> it<00:01:11.369> if

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:12.920 
owning the game just experience it if

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.590 
owning the game just experience it if
you<00:01:13.920> don't<00:01:14.130> have<00:01:14.250> a<00:01:14.280> second<00:01:14.759> controller<00:01:15.180> you

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
you don't have a second controller you

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.630 
you don't have a second controller you
could<00:01:15.750> still<00:01:16.050> play<00:01:16.200> with<00:01:16.320> only<00:01:16.800> one<00:01:17.039> holding

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
could still play with only one holding

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.330 
could still play with only one holding
it<00:01:17.910> the<00:01:18.030> normal<00:01:18.390> way<00:01:18.450> but<00:01:19.289> it's<00:01:19.470> very<00:01:19.560> clumsy

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
it the normal way but it's very clumsy

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.029 
it the normal way but it's very clumsy
and<00:01:20.580> I<00:01:20.729> don't<00:01:20.789> recommend<00:01:21.300> it<00:01:21.740> you<00:01:22.740> can<00:01:22.890> also

00:01:23.029 --> 00:01:23.039 
and I don't recommend it you can also

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:25.070 
and I don't recommend it you can also
use<00:01:23.340> the<00:01:23.520> unusual<00:01:24.000> control<00:01:24.390> scheme<00:01:24.690> to<00:01:24.869> play

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
use the unusual control scheme to play

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.169 
use the unusual control scheme to play
two<00:01:25.140> player<00:01:25.560> co-op<00:01:25.890> you'll<00:01:26.700> just<00:01:26.910> need<00:01:27.119> to

00:01:27.169 --> 00:01:27.179 
two player co-op you'll just need to

00:01:27.179 --> 00:01:29.240 
two player co-op you'll just need to
have<00:01:27.420> a<00:01:27.450> four<00:01:27.780> player<00:01:27.960> multi-tap<00:01:28.590> and<00:01:28.830> four
