00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
 very our chosen ones we are in 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:06.810
 minecraft 1.6 point 4 let's see a 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.880
 So a mod that is assumed anything that is 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.070
 is a boat adrift history and know that 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.019
 I like it a lot but it's kind 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:17.190
 of the mirror we are going to see it because it is 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:21.210
 this up here the left part would be 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:24.180
 the left f3 is this right part and it's 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.310
 a mirror for the helmet is quite 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.109
 Pretty cool but good the storage room 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.029
 this one here 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.309
 as you see two crystal two iron and 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:35.250
 one stick and for the other the other way around 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.480
 make the glass in company we have 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.309
 seen before it left 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.170
 is just right and the stick 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.390
 the other side too but it 's pretty 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.399
 pretty good we're going to ride protection 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.920
 if it is not after the table the fret 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.930
 we put a helmet I put a leather 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.970
 one diamond you can put what you want 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.920
 let's try each one 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:56.010
 Oh 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:59.339
 and this around here this is the one on the right 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:02.729
 ok let's put our there and as 

00:00:59.339 --> 00:01:05.880
 you see here on the right that is super 

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:08.340
 well this is a bit weird cool if 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.690
 you were driving a car but you see 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.330
 that is coming up the particles to 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:15.150
 string that are behind me 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.350
 It's cool too much bad what you get 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.820
 cover some visibility of the screen 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.730
 for example do where I am seeing 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.500
 this one here 

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:25.820
 that's the bad thing but ghana is a lot 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:28.100
 it's coming from behind, it's fashion, a lot later 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:30.680
 the other is simply upside down to the 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:33.210
 left I do not know because I think that a 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:35.700
 the left I like more 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:38.400
 I think I do think that I like it better 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.049
 but it's very cool, it's a 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.990
 mine so how are you seeing is a 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:45.150
 foolishness but I do not know I found it funny 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.560
 I have told you can teach it in 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:49.320
 actually this mode has enough time 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.600
 but enough but I do not know I had never 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.770
 the curiosity to see how well it is 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:57.450
 pretty pretty good 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:02:00.119
 so what happened I'm looking now 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.729
 here for the mines and well I just 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:04.920
 get in there behind hehe but 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.090
 when they are big jumps yes because 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:10.039
 you have to look down then 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.039
 you see what is behind what is above 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:18.720
 steps like that are steps so you do not see 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.850
 very good either especially when you're 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.489
 here do not come you have to lower the camera 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:25.880
 to look back ahead you do not see but 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:28.260
 I have not found it very useful 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:30.810
 if there is not the tri per 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:33.019
 I am observing both cameras a 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.019
 little bit 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.159
 with this 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:46.709
 yes man you can look from behind 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.090
 it's fine, also here, it's good 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:49.500
 because as they tend to be very 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.760
 long 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:53.330
 you can see perfectly what's in 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.940
 one side with this much destroyed 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:56.390
 oh god you can always see well what 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:59.050
 there is behind 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:59.050
 good here they are 

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:03.500
 then I go to them 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:08.280
 Man here it comes in handy from 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:10.710
 then because as you can see from behind 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:13.920
 and the hallways are unique 

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:16.710
 or are they unique that are diners online 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:19.110
 single straight I said I do not know why the 

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:22.290
 mind you look when you get the good 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:24.270
 not bad but so what bothers you just 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:26.490
 we tell ourselves that you can see very very well 

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:29.550
 especially in this kind of look at all 

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:31.650
 ways as there are sometimes some who 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:33.120
 like the rare seeds are you so that 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:37.370
 This seed has nothing strange but 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:37.370
 good is the seed and wii 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:42.700
 and these are the coordinates I do not know 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:44.380
 I saw but good in case someone 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.810
 interesting although it does not have much not only 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:47.730
 we have seen this 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:50.069
 but there to see 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:53.069
 yes but I like in these mines is where 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:54.599
 subtler sees the hostilities may 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:57.540
 be see the particles of the potion the 

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:59.780
 stoic I am flying but if here it is 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:03.430
 where more subtle seems to me especially 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:04.959
 because that because they are in a straight line 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:08.590
 either in a straight line you can see 

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:11.170
 perfectly what there is my mother 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:12.010
 is within this of the good rmi today 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:14.440
 what am i 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:15.819
 my mother there is everything here but well 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:17.139
 for the talking friends of left 

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:19.720
 because if someone is interested in what is 

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:21.310
 here when you have to sbs of little pain 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:23.590
 more than or you leave the seed and over here 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:25.600
 there are many many things 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:29.790
 to be in a temple of six ships like that 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:32.680
 I get it right but well it's not bad 

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:34.479
 been in the rearview mirror this weird but 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:37.479
 good that he has no more the model is 

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:39.220
 it really is for the 1.6 point 4 it 

00:04:37.479 --> 00:04:41.440
 install with forge etcetera tennis in that 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:44.530
 the description the third dt I'm going to 

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:46.650
 see my ass like that without realizing that I 

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:49.460
 He is watching 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:49.460
 a brushing 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:58.580
 bye
