one cocoa puffs $1.99 today my video is
going<00:00:24.320> to<00:00:24.410> be<00:00:24.470> about<00:00:24.710> how<00:00:25.040> to<00:00:25.099> choose<00:00:26.680> what

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:27.680 
going to be about how to choose what

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:29.790

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:29.800 
type of unicycle to get for beginners

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:35.490 
type of unicycle to get for beginners
now<00:00:31.090> so<00:00:32.110> basically<00:00:33.110> the<00:00:33.590> types<00:00:33.940> there's

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:35.500 
now so basically the types there's

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:40.710 
now so basically the types there's
freestyle<00:00:36.500> I<00:00:37.239> don't<00:00:38.239> have<00:00:38.480> any<00:00:38.630> free<00:00:38.899> styles

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:40.720 
freestyle I don't have any free styles

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:43.060 
freestyle I don't have any free styles
freestyle<00:00:41.720> would<00:00:41.870> be<00:00:41.989> similar<00:00:42.350> to<00:00:42.410> this<00:00:42.620> the

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:43.070 
freestyle would be similar to this the

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:47.709 
freestyle would be similar to this the
20-inch<00:00:43.460> one<00:00:43.760> that<00:00:44.359> one<00:00:44.480> right<00:00:44.629> there<00:00:46.719> there

00:00:47.709 --> 00:00:47.719 
20-inch one that one right there there

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:51.160 
20-inch one that one right there there
same<00:00:48.469> size<00:00:49.010> wheel<00:00:49.430> most<00:00:49.820> of<00:00:50.030> the<00:00:50.090> time<00:00:50.300> the

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:51.170 
same size wheel most of the time the

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:53.529 
same size wheel most of the time the
only<00:00:51.410> difference<00:00:51.829> really<00:00:51.949> is<00:00:52.550> that<00:00:52.609> you<00:00:53.359> see

00:00:53.529 --> 00:00:53.539 
only difference really is that you see

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:55.930 
only difference really is that you see
right<00:00:53.780> here<00:00:53.809> how<00:00:54.289> the<00:00:54.350> post<00:00:54.710> goes<00:00:55.190> like<00:00:55.489> curly

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:55.940 
right here how the post goes like curly

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:00.849

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:26.830 
getting around it's also quite good for

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:28.990 
getting around it's also quite good for
like<00:01:27.830> mountain<00:01:28.250> unicycling

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.000 
like mountain unicycling

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:35.640 
like mountain unicycling
moving<00:01:29.510> second<00:01:29.980> you<00:01:30.980> can<00:01:31.100> see<00:01:31.750> it's<00:01:32.750> a<00:01:33.520> 24<00:01:34.520> by

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:35.650 
moving second you can see it's a 24 by

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:41.020

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
1.95 but that was

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.030 
1.95 but that was
actually<00:01:53.380> maybe<00:01:53.560> it<00:01:53.740> was<00:01:53.860> a<00:01:54.210> holy<00:01:55.259> 75<00:01:56.259> but<00:01:56.950> it

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:57.040 
actually maybe it was a holy 75 but it

00:01:59.399 --> 00:01:59.409 
was pretty pretty well the same as the

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:02.609 
was pretty pretty well the same as the
little<00:01:59.650> games<00:01:59.799> like<00:02:00.070> was<00:02:00.220> tired<00:02:01.229> and<00:02:02.229> I<00:02:02.380> didn't

smallest<00:03:30.890> this<00:03:31.890> is<00:03:32.070> my<00:03:32.220> least<00:03:32.459> favorite<00:03:32.910> over

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
smallest this is my least favorite over

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:37.910 
smallest this is my least favorite over
bunch<00:03:34.340> mainly<00:03:35.340> just<00:03:35.490> because<00:03:36.260> the<00:03:37.260> cranks

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920 
bunch mainly just because the cranks

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:41.809 
bunch mainly just because the cranks
these<00:03:38.670> things<00:03:38.940> here<00:03:39.209> that<00:03:40.140> go<00:03:40.320> between

00:03:41.809 --> 00:03:41.819 
these things here that go between

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:47.660 
these things here that go between
the<00:03:41.969> axle<00:03:42.750> or<00:03:43.099> the<00:03:44.099> hub<00:03:44.719> to<00:03:45.719> the<00:03:45.900> pedal<00:03:46.670> they're

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:47.670 
the axle or the hub to the pedal they're

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:59.170 
the axle or the hub to the pedal they're
small<00:03:48.150> so<00:03:49.140> it<00:03:49.409> makes<00:03:50.010> you<00:03:50.129> go<00:03:50.280> pretty<00:03:50.459> slow

00:03:59.170 --> 00:03:59.180 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:08.539 

quite<00:04:00.180> a<00:04:00.209> bit<00:04:05.030> but<00:04:06.030> really<00:04:07.220> pissing<00:04:08.220> off<00:04:08.310> that
