saddle<00:01:51.170> would<00:01:51.440> sit<00:01:51.650> and<00:01:51.860> it's<00:01:52.010> also<00:01:52.190> a<00:01:52.400> good

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:52.580 
saddle would sit and it's also a good

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:55.149 
saddle would sit and it's also a good
idea<00:01:52.640> to<00:01:53.090> take<00:01:53.270> a<00:01:53.330> photo<00:01:53.720> of<00:01:53.869> yourself<00:01:54.159> putting

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:55.159 
idea to take a photo of yourself putting

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:56.680 
idea to take a photo of yourself putting
that<00:01:55.340> wire<00:01:55.580> in<00:01:55.820> so<00:01:56.000> we<00:01:56.150> can<00:01:56.330> see<00:01:56.540> because

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:56.690 
that wire in so we can see because

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:58.840 
that wire in so we can see because
obviously<00:01:56.990> if<00:01:57.320> you<00:01:57.440> put<00:01:57.650> it<00:01:57.740> back<00:01:57.920> here<00:01:58.220> you

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:58.850 
obviously if you put it back here you

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:00.340 
obviously if you put it back here you
got<00:01:58.970> to<00:01:59.090> get<00:01:59.210> a<00:01:59.240> very<00:01:59.510> different<00:01:59.690> reading<00:02:00.200> to

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:00.350 
got to get a very different reading to

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:02.800 
got to get a very different reading to
up<00:02:00.500> here<00:02:00.680> so<00:02:01.310> we<00:02:01.760> really<00:02:02.090> need<00:02:02.270> very<00:02:02.659> accurate

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810 
up here so we really need very accurate

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.170 
up here so we really need very accurate
information<00:02:03.439> and<00:02:04.010> that'll<00:02:04.640> really<00:02:04.760> help<00:02:05.090> us

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:05.180 
information and that'll really help us

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:06.910 
information and that'll really help us
to<00:02:05.330> determine<00:02:05.479> the<00:02:05.869> best<00:02:06.020> fit<00:02:06.229> for<00:02:06.260> the<00:02:06.470> horse

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 
to determine the best fit for the horse

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.119 
to determine the best fit for the horse
another<00:02:07.640> thing<00:02:07.909> we<00:02:08.030> look<00:02:08.209> at<00:02:08.360> is<00:02:08.799> we<00:02:09.799> really

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:10.129 
another thing we look at is we really

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:12.100 
another thing we look at is we really
got<00:02:10.280> a<00:02:10.310> design<00:02:10.640> a<00:02:10.670> saddle<00:02:11.209> it'll<00:02:11.420> fit<00:02:11.659> your

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
got a design a saddle it'll fit your

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:14.199 
got a design a saddle it'll fit your
widest<00:02:12.590> horse<00:02:12.830> and<00:02:13.099> use<00:02:13.400> pads<00:02:13.760> and<00:02:14.030> things

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:14.209 
widest horse and use pads and things

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:16.089 
widest horse and use pads and things
which<00:02:14.360> I'll<00:02:14.510> talk<00:02:14.690> about<00:02:14.750> later<00:02:15.200> on<00:02:15.740> to<00:02:15.950> fit

00:02:16.089 --> 00:02:16.099 
which I'll talk about later on to fit

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:17.830 
which I'll talk about later on to fit
your<00:02:16.250> narrow<00:02:16.459> horses

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
your narrow horses

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.990 
your narrow horses
then<00:02:18.840> we<00:02:18.930> get<00:02:19.080> the<00:02:19.230> why<00:02:19.530> like<00:02:19.860> this<00:02:20.100> trace<00:02:20.820> it

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
then we get the why like this trace it

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.550 
then we get the why like this trace it
out<00:02:21.090> on<00:02:21.240> a<00:02:21.270> piece<00:02:21.660> of<00:02:21.720> paper<00:02:22.080> and<00:02:22.320> you're<00:02:22.440> gonna

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
out on a piece of paper and you're gonna

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:23.960 
out on a piece of paper and you're gonna
have<00:02:22.680> the<00:02:22.770> facts<00:02:22.980> that<00:02:23.160> email<00:02:23.490> or<00:02:23.520> whatever

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
horses and for the purpose of this

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:39.370 
horses and for the purpose of this
exercise<00:02:37.560> we've<00:02:38.250> got<00:02:38.400> these<00:02:38.550> different<00:02:38.760> trees

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:39.380 
exercise we've got these different trees

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:41.390 
exercise we've got these different trees
to<00:02:40.380> show<00:02:40.590> you<00:02:40.650> the<00:02:40.830> difference<00:02:41.190> of<00:02:41.340> a

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
to show you the difference of a

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.040 
to show you the difference of a
different<00:02:41.700> style<00:02:41.880> of<00:02:42.060> tree<00:02:42.270> we've<00:02:42.660> got<00:02:42.810> here<00:02:43.020> a

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
different style of tree we've got here a

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:44.840 
different style of tree we've got here a
stock<00:02:43.380> horse<00:02:43.650> tree<00:02:43.980> which<00:02:44.580> for<00:02:44.760> this

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
stock horse tree which for this

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:47.960 
stock horse tree which for this
particular<00:02:45.060> horse<00:02:45.630> is<00:02:46.340> the<00:02:47.340> tree<00:02:47.610> is<00:02:47.790> too

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
particular horse is the tree is too

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:51.530 
particular horse is the tree is too
narrow<00:02:48.180> so<00:02:49.190> change<00:02:50.190> over<00:02:50.490> to<00:02:50.640> a<00:02:50.670> semi<00:02:51.210> quarter

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
narrow so change over to a semi quarter

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.340 
narrow so change over to a semi quarter
horse<00:02:53.180> which<00:02:54.180> does<00:02:54.450> sit<00:02:54.720> down<00:02:54.930> a<00:02:54.960> little<00:02:55.170> bit

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
horse which does sit down a little bit

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:57.470 
horse which does sit down a little bit
lower<00:02:55.560> but<00:02:56.220> this<00:02:56.670> horse<00:02:56.880> in<00:02:57.090> this<00:02:57.209> particular

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
lower but this horse in this particular

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.990 
lower but this horse in this particular
condition<00:02:57.900> I<00:02:58.260> still<00:02:58.560> feel<00:02:58.770> at<00:02:59.010> this<00:02:59.190> saddle<00:02:59.880> is

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
condition I still feel at this saddle is

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.970 
condition I still feel at this saddle is
a<00:03:00.120> little<00:03:00.570> bit<00:03:00.750> a<00:03:00.900> little<00:03:01.290> bit<00:03:01.440> narrow<00:03:01.770> for

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
a little bit a little bit narrow for

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:03.860 
a little bit a little bit narrow for
that<00:03:02.070> particular<00:03:02.340> horse<00:03:02.700> and<00:03:03.510> we'll<00:03:03.630> try<00:03:03.840> a

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
that particular horse and we'll try a

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:09.230 
that particular horse and we'll try a
quarter<00:03:04.260> horse<00:03:04.380> tree<00:03:06.920> and<00:03:07.920> this<00:03:08.340> tree<00:03:08.610> sits

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:09.240 
quarter horse tree and this tree sits

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:11.720 
quarter horse tree and this tree sits
down<00:03:09.420> really<00:03:09.840> nicely<00:03:10.080> still<00:03:10.920> enough<00:03:11.190> room<00:03:11.430> in

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
down really nicely still enough room in

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:13.790 
down really nicely still enough room in
the<00:03:12.090> in<00:03:12.240> the<00:03:12.360> top<00:03:12.510> and<00:03:12.720> the<00:03:12.810> gullet<00:03:13.080> for

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:13.800 
the in the top and the gullet for

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.860 
the in the top and the gullet for
freedom<00:03:14.160> there<00:03:14.340> and<00:03:14.550> it's<00:03:14.940> very<00:03:15.180> important<00:03:15.780> to

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
freedom there and it's very important to

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:18.290 
freedom there and it's very important to
keep<00:03:16.050> that<00:03:16.110> wither<00:03:16.830> and<00:03:17.130> backbone<00:03:17.910> really

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:18.300 
keep that wither and backbone really

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:19.820 
keep that wither and backbone really
free<00:03:18.540> so<00:03:18.750> that<00:03:18.780> the<00:03:18.990> horse<00:03:19.200> can<00:03:19.410> move<00:03:19.560> freely

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:19.830 
free so that the horse can move freely

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:23.030 
free so that the horse can move freely
also<00:03:20.790> critical<00:03:21.330> is<00:03:21.540> that<00:03:21.720> the<00:03:21.810> shoulders<00:03:22.350> that

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
also critical is that the shoulders that

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.350 
also critical is that the shoulders that
the<00:03:23.190> saddle<00:03:23.519> the<00:03:23.550> front<00:03:23.760> of<00:03:23.850> the<00:03:23.910> saddle<00:03:24.120> is

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:24.360 
the saddle the front of the saddle is

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:25.910 
the saddle the front of the saddle is
not<00:03:24.540> digging<00:03:25.170> into<00:03:25.410> the<00:03:25.560> front<00:03:25.769> of<00:03:25.860> the

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
not digging into the front of the

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.400 
not digging into the front of the
solders<00:03:26.370> so<00:03:26.550> that<00:03:26.700> it<00:03:27.600> doesn't<00:03:27.900> restrict<00:03:28.050> it

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
solders so that it doesn't restrict it

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:31.460 
solders so that it doesn't restrict it
so<00:03:29.040> it<00:03:29.430> is<00:03:29.640> really<00:03:30.000> important<00:03:30.630> and<00:03:30.840> we<00:03:31.080> do<00:03:31.260> take

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
so it is really important and we do take

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.470 
so it is really important and we do take
a<00:03:31.530> lot<00:03:31.830> of<00:03:31.890> care<00:03:32.130> and<00:03:32.400> a<00:03:32.430> lot<00:03:32.550> of<00:03:32.580> trouble<00:03:32.820> to

our horse drops down and condition there
can<00:06:09.430> be<00:06:09.460> a<00:06:09.639> possibility<00:06:10.180> that<00:06:10.539> the<00:06:11.310> gullet<00:06:12.310> can

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:12.550 
can be a possibility that the gullet can

can be a possibility that the gullet can
touch<00:06:12.760> down<00:06:13.030> on<00:06:13.060> the<00:06:13.270> top<00:06:13.510> of<00:06:13.630> the<00:06:13.690> wither<00:06:13.870> if

touch down on the top of the wither if

00:06:14.349 --> 00:06:15.930 
touch down on the top of the wither if
you've<00:06:14.530> got<00:06:14.620> a<00:06:14.650> situation<00:06:14.860> like<00:06:15.370> that<00:06:15.430> instead

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:15.940 
you've got a situation like that instead

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:18.120 
you've got a situation like that instead
of<00:06:16.060> having<00:06:16.180> to<00:06:16.330> buy<00:06:16.449> a<00:06:16.479> special<00:06:16.900> saddle<00:06:17.410> for<00:06:17.620> we

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:18.130 
of having to buy a special saddle for we

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:20.820 
of having to buy a special saddle for we
have<00:06:18.340> here<00:06:18.580> designed<00:06:18.940> a<00:06:19.150> a<00:06:19.330> cutaway<00:06:19.900> chambers

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:20.830 
have here designed a a cutaway chambers

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:23.850 
have here designed a a cutaway chambers
pad<00:06:21.760> which<00:06:22.599> the<00:06:22.780> idea<00:06:23.080> of<00:06:23.199> that<00:06:23.320> is<00:06:23.380> to<00:06:23.530> lift

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:23.860 
pad which the idea of that is to lift

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:25.560 
pad which the idea of that is to lift
the<00:06:24.039> saddle<00:06:24.370> a<00:06:24.430> bit<00:06:24.610> but<00:06:24.940> give<00:06:25.150> plenty<00:06:25.479> of

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:25.570 
the saddle a bit but give plenty of

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:27.500 
the saddle a bit but give plenty of
clearance<00:06:25.900> and<00:06:26.229> the<00:06:26.349> gullet<00:06:26.650> in<00:06:26.740> the<00:06:26.800> back<00:06:26.979> ban

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:27.510 
clearance and the gullet in the back ban

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:34.730 
clearance and the gullet in the back ban
sit<00:06:28.510> it<00:06:28.599> on<00:06:28.720> there<00:06:28.930> like<00:06:29.139> that

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:34.740 

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:38.219 

so<00:06:35.740> the<00:06:35.889> beauty<00:06:36.219> of<00:06:36.249> that<00:06:36.430> is<00:06:36.490> that<00:06:36.939> it<00:06:37.900> still

00:06:38.219 --> 00:06:38.229 
so the beauty of that is that it still

00:06:38.229 --> 00:06:39.719 
so the beauty of that is that it still
gives<00:06:38.650> that<00:06:38.830> little<00:06:38.919> bit<00:06:39.129> of<00:06:39.159> clearance<00:06:39.490> and

00:06:39.719 --> 00:06:39.729 
gives that little bit of clearance and

00:06:39.729 --> 00:06:40.980 
gives that little bit of clearance and
freedom<00:06:40.120> so<00:06:40.270> that<00:06:40.300> there's<00:06:40.629> plenty<00:06:40.689> of

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:40.990 
freedom so that there's plenty of

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:42.570 
freedom so that there's plenty of
movement<00:06:41.469> up<00:06:41.560> along<00:06:41.800> the<00:06:41.919> backbone<00:06:42.099> and

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:42.580 
movement up along the backbone and

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:44.489 
movement up along the backbone and
there's<00:06:43.060> no<00:06:43.240> danger<00:06:43.719> of<00:06:43.749> touching<00:06:44.169> down<00:06:44.319> on

00:06:44.489 --> 00:06:44.499 
there's no danger of touching down on

00:06:44.499 --> 00:06:46.140 
there's no danger of touching down on
the<00:06:44.620> top<00:06:44.770> of<00:06:44.889> the<00:06:44.949> wither<00:06:45.129> it<00:06:45.729> works<00:06:45.939> really

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:46.150 
the top of the wither it works really

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:48.270 
the top of the wither it works really
well
