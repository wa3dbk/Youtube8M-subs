00:07:25.489 --> 00:07:25.499 
card which is really really important

00:07:25.499 --> 00:07:27.019 
card which is really really important
when<00:07:25.650> you<00:07:25.740> have<00:07:25.860> a<00:07:25.889> camera<00:07:26.279> that's<00:07:26.699> one<00:07:26.849> of<00:07:26.939> the

00:07:27.019 --> 00:07:27.029 
when you have a camera that's one of the

00:07:27.029 --> 00:07:29.089 
when you have a camera that's one of the
things<00:07:27.270> that<00:07:27.419> I<00:07:27.509> need<00:07:27.809> that's<00:07:28.439> pretty<00:07:28.770> much<00:07:28.860> it

00:07:29.089 --> 00:07:29.099 
things that I need that's pretty much it

00:07:29.099 --> 00:07:30.469 
things that I need that's pretty much it
though<00:07:29.279> whenever<00:07:29.490> I<00:07:29.610> get<00:07:29.729> the<00:07:29.879> SD<00:07:29.999> card

00:07:30.469 --> 00:07:30.479 
though whenever I get the SD card

00:07:30.479 --> 00:07:32.629 
though whenever I get the SD card
everything<00:07:30.749> should<00:07:31.169> run<00:07:31.439> smoothly<00:07:31.860> and<00:07:32.339> I

00:07:32.629 --> 00:07:32.639 
everything should run smoothly and I

00:07:32.639 --> 00:07:34.999 
everything should run smoothly and I
should<00:07:32.939> be<00:07:33.120> able<00:07:33.419> to<00:07:33.569> do<00:07:33.779> this<00:07:34.020> regularly<00:07:34.409> and

00:07:34.999 --> 00:07:35.009 
should be able to do this regularly and

00:07:35.009 --> 00:07:36.619 
should be able to do this regularly and
this<00:07:35.129> is<00:07:35.309> a<00:07:35.339> little<00:07:35.669> bit<00:07:35.849> weird<00:07:36.149> because<00:07:36.419> I

00:07:36.619 --> 00:07:36.629 
this is a little bit weird because I

00:07:36.629 --> 00:07:38.989 
this is a little bit weird because I
don't<00:07:36.899> usually<00:07:37.020> do<00:07:37.439> video<00:07:37.770> logs<00:07:38.069> I<00:07:38.339> don't<00:07:38.789> do

00:07:38.989 --> 00:07:38.999 
don't usually do video logs I don't do

00:07:38.999 --> 00:07:41.659 
don't usually do video logs I don't do
them<00:07:39.210> often<00:07:40.020> but<00:07:40.439> I've<00:07:40.589> done<00:07:40.800> them<00:07:40.979> before<00:07:41.370> so

00:07:41.659 --> 00:07:41.669 
them often but I've done them before so

00:07:41.669 --> 00:07:43.549 
them often but I've done them before so
I'm<00:07:41.819> not<00:07:41.849> like<00:07:42.180> the<00:07:42.389> best<00:07:42.569> video<00:07:43.020> logger<00:07:43.349> in

00:07:43.549 --> 00:07:43.559 
I'm not like the best video logger in

00:07:43.559 --> 00:07:45.230 
I'm not like the best video logger in
the<00:07:43.680> world<00:07:43.889> but<00:07:44.159> with<00:07:44.309> everything<00:07:44.610> practice

00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:45.240 
the world but with everything practice

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:47.299 
the world but with everything practice
makes<00:07:45.449> perfect<00:07:45.689> and<00:07:46.050> over<00:07:46.529> time<00:07:46.800> I<00:07:46.830> will<00:07:47.009> get

00:07:47.299 --> 00:07:47.309 
makes perfect and over time I will get

00:07:47.309 --> 00:07:49.189 
makes perfect and over time I will get
better<00:07:47.520> and<00:07:47.759> better<00:07:47.849> at<00:07:48.300> doing<00:07:48.569> stuff<00:07:49.110> like

00:07:49.189 --> 00:07:49.199 
better and better at doing stuff like

00:07:49.199 --> 00:07:51.349 
better and better at doing stuff like
this
