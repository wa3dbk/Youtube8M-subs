00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.149
 there will be times 

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:08.059
 through an electric motor it 

00:00:05.149 --> 00:00:09.550
 Transforms movement to mediate through 

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:12.370
 a gear that reduces its speed 

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:14.850
 subsequently it passes to a 

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:18.060
 crank what 

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:20.460
 travels in a circular motion and passes to 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:25.790
 turn to a turret hand crank 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:29.550
 to which the linear motion of oscillating 

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:34.440
 is that it collects and collects air that passes 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:37.260
 through the syringe is an angle 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.750
 then this air passes through a 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.449
 valve that prevents its recoil something what 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:45.120
 which are filled these two deposits and 

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:48.180
 later 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.590
 when they are full they reach an end of 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:56.310
 career in which it will be cut 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:01:01.809
 the engine and then by valve one 

00:00:56.310 --> 00:01:05.170
 Shut-off valve will rise and fall 

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:07.750
 this this lifting platform is worth this 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:10.560
 air gets down there to some cylinders yes 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:15.330
 which are the ones that raise the platform 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.330
 Okay, let's see it later 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:17.939
 First 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:33.460
 word reached and the pressure because 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:35.670
 the motor shoe and the green one has been 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:35.670
 switched on 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.320
 hard in your mind 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.300
 now my mind 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.959
 so there's something we do environment 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.170
 I do not know why
