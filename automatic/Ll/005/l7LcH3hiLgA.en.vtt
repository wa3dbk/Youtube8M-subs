00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.359
 hello and welcome to skin grain 

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:10.769
 is today I propose you 

00:00:07.359 --> 00:00:13.180
 a time routine for dry skin 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.130
 because it was asked of me and also 

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:17.109
 because it's my skin type so I 

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:20.440
 will show you what I'm doing him 

00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:22.710
 missing jappo really in a hurry then 

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:25.539
 you must already moisturize your skin 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.190
 it is essential with a cream not too much 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:29.410
 oily otherwise your makeup will not 

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:33.039
 come in but a pretty moisturizing cream 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:37.120
 and nourishing and after the best it's 

00:00:33.039 --> 00:00:40.360
 to use a base of complexion printer 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:42.370
 moisturizer and the one on burns it's very 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:43.410
 very well for that it moisturizes very well 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:48.640
 well 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:51.760
 in addition it is without paraben without 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:56.010
 silicone all that so that's really 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:01:00.010
 very very well so I put a pump 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.480
 here is for all face in Japan first 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:02.350
 on the finger and then I apply them 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:04.449
 on the face 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:11.259
 So over my moisturizer 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:12.999
 day and actually it's going to allow the 

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:17.740
 skin to be really very very good 

00:01:12.999 --> 00:01:22.060
 hydrated and busy and prevent your 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:25.029
 foundation dries the skin or any 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:26.289
 so that really I have this product you 

00:01:25.029 --> 00:01:27.849
 can very well put a foundation 

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:29.439
 powder me that's what I do ago 

00:01:27.849 --> 00:01:33.399
 really no problem while my 

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:35.229
 skin is really very dry but like 

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:36.149
 we asked for something in 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:39.170
 particular 

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:42.200
 I will advise you 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:44.900
 this king of nations the bottom of an accent 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.610
 light from home who is really 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:48.140
 very very good and hyper hyper moisturizing 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:48.649
 but on the other hand not very very covering 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:49.700
 lack 

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:51.860
 good if you had a lot 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.030
 imperfections all that I you 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:53.799
 do not advise too much because it's not going well 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:57.619
 satisfy you 

00:01:53.799 --> 00:02:00.799
 but well then we go and here I take the 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:03.229
 brush bd read 1949 which is really 

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:05.030
 very very good for this foundation on 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:09.050
 actually jean letter directly on the 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:13.069
 brush and then I add as and 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:14.870
 measure and actually the foundation it 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:15.350
 is really super hydrating and it's 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.540
 the same 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:23.060
 so it's there it's even better it's 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:25.489
 it is this one there is 18% organic and 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.060
 the result the result the origin of the 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:28.580
 ingredients 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:30.290
 these are natural ingredients so in 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:31.160
 the more it does not risk you have put the 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:34.430
 skin no longer why 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:36.920
 well, not you ruined it but it's okay 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:42.650
 allow her to breathe and at the same 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:44.180
 time it is a failure but 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:46.040
 really for dry skin 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:48.440
 there is only one thing to do is 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:51.709
 to really moisturize is primordial morning 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:53.890
 the evenings and that's what there is only 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:59.959
 like that you have skin 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:03:01.280
 enough to hydrate what even for 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:04.989
 even for other skin types a 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.989
 it's very very important to swim 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:10.250
 she blends complexion it is very very 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:13.940
 nice because we do not feel 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:16.970
 everything does not feel like having a 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:19.989
 mask on the face what's so it's 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:19.989
 While it's pretty nice 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:23.930
 so after you are not obliged in 

00:03:22.609 --> 00:03:25.190
 art and especially the face you can 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:25.760
 put it right where you have it 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:28.390
 need 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.390
 and then that's all 

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:36.020
 that's it for the foundation then I 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:38.780
 I'm going to use a little anti-dark circles 

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:44.570
 so here it is the hard nude ski when 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:46.190
 hiller in ivory hue 00 a and so 

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:48.080
 the peculiarity of this anti-dark circles 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:50.510
 it is that he is also he reaches but 

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:53.060
 very little covering so there i'm going 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:59.840
 use the Round 6 hours from home 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:04:06.470
 all to apply it the same I add 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:08.000
 as and when sent me I 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:15.560
 finds that it is a bit too clear for 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:17.120
 the incarnation and beautiful that and stone 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:20.709
 herman the underside of the eye when one is 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:20.709
 tired is not worse 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:31.550
 how after they will find you have 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:33.780
 put too much you pick up your brush 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:36.590
 foundation why is it a little by 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:41.610
 on it and that's it 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:43.409
 neither seen nor known then it's when 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:45.330
 even important to use a powder 

00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:46.199
 because it will allow you to fix 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:48.569
 like you and me 

00:04:46.199 --> 00:04:51.539
 so me I used the mine airlines 

00:04:48.569 --> 00:04:55.590
 kent finish of mac because the very 

00:04:51.539 --> 00:04:57.419
 very fine is really really very 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:05:00.539
 very well and so me I in color 

00:04:57.419 --> 00:05:03.389
 media quentin this medium i use the 

00:05:00.539 --> 00:05:05.909
 brush laying chablis yvonne is in 

00:05:03.389 --> 00:05:07.199
 does if you really have the blame really 

00:05:05.909 --> 00:05:12.740
 very dry the better this fear is 

00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:16.430
 only the zone t like this 

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:16.430
 here is the front 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:22.629
 here and after for the rest you 

00:05:19.629 --> 00:05:24.150
 resume more or less short and you 

00:05:22.629 --> 00:05:26.590
 pass as seen on the face 

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:28.270
 history to fix a little everything but 

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:30.840
 without input it's now so here 

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:34.419
 after I finish with a little bit of 

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:40.659
 transparent mascara in the eyebrow for 

00:05:34.419 --> 00:05:44.110
 fix it a little bit and then I'll take 

00:05:40.659 --> 00:05:47.580
 a buzz sculptor so that of home 

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:49.449
 bourjois is actually you have light and 

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:51.550
 and the matte blush 

00:05:49.449 --> 00:05:54.810
 so I take the same brushes and I 

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:54.810
 will apply the matte color 

00:05:55.379 --> 00:06:04.300
 but actually just on the bulges of the 

00:05:59.919 --> 00:06:07.800
 faceless smile this is where it will 

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:09.969
 the most natural 

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:12.639
 finally the most natural has ever been 

00:06:09.969 --> 00:06:15.580
 natural like everything but that puts that will do 

00:06:12.639 --> 00:06:17.469
 not too sophisticated what so here's the 

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:21.129
 int 1 road for dry skin 

00:06:17.469 --> 00:06:24.459
 I hope you liked it 

00:06:21.129 --> 00:06:26.379
 it is very bearable during the day and it 

00:06:24.459 --> 00:06:30.339
 will fade over time it's a 

00:06:26.379 --> 00:06:32.050
 makeup that is made light and which me 

00:06:30.339 --> 00:06:33.539
 I like this idea in which 

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:35.860
 it's ephemeral and it's moving 

00:06:33.539 --> 00:06:37.389
 the day I do not like finding myself with 

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:39.489
 a mask and that it takes from morning to 

00:06:37.389 --> 00:06:42.309
 tonight it's not at all what I like 

00:06:39.489 --> 00:06:43.719
 but this is for dry skin is 

00:06:42.309 --> 00:06:46.300
 really very well, I advise you 

00:06:43.719 --> 00:06:47.559
 still fluid textures because 

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:47.949
 that it is serious always more than 

00:06:47.559 --> 00:06:50.589
 powder 

00:06:47.949 --> 00:06:52.419
 but if you use products 

00:06:50.589 --> 00:06:53.499
 moisturizers before there is no 

00:06:52.419 --> 00:06:56.559
 problem you can still in 

00:06:53.499 --> 00:06:59.139
 use a powder finally you see my 

00:06:56.559 --> 00:07:00.249
 routine of a mix that suits me 

00:06:59.139 --> 00:07:02.129
 perfectly to me that's what I do 

00:07:00.249 --> 00:07:04.949
 every day right now so 

00:07:02.129 --> 00:07:07.719
 after that it is a question of choice of 

00:07:04.949 --> 00:07:09.519
 pleasure that we used powders or 

00:07:07.719 --> 00:07:10.409
 rather fluid textures sas had 

00:07:09.519 --> 00:07:12.610
 full of each 

00:07:10.409 --> 00:07:14.800
 but really for dry skin 

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:16.300
 just moisturize it properly 

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:17.589
 his skin to use a premium thank you 

00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:19.539
 you really have too dry skin 

00:07:17.589 --> 00:07:21.279
 me that's what I'm doing it's going a lot 

00:07:19.539 --> 00:07:23.199
 better my makeup and prettier too 

00:07:21.279 --> 00:07:25.569
 so I think that changes when 

00:07:23.199 --> 00:07:28.869
 even really a lot of makeup 

00:07:25.569 --> 00:07:30.550
 to use a name so here I am you 

00:07:28.869 --> 00:07:32.529
 do big big kisses I hope that 

00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:33.219
 it will have pleased you and we find ourselves in 

00:07:32.529 --> 00:07:35.999
 a video 

00:07:33.219 --> 00:07:35.999
 see you soon ciao
