okay so lately I've been doing a lot of

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.710 
okay so lately I've been doing a lot of
glue-up<00:00:12.150> work<00:00:12.389> and<00:00:13.139> I've<00:00:13.290> been<00:00:13.469> very<00:00:13.710> first

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:14.720 
glue-up work and I've been very first

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:16.690 
glue-up work and I've been very first
because<00:00:14.960> when<00:00:15.680> I<00:00:15.710> grew<00:00:16.010> up<00:00:16.040> several<00:00:16.340> pieces

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:16.700 
because when I grew up several pieces

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:20.500 
because when I grew up several pieces
that<00:00:16.970> who<00:00:17.740> makes<00:00:18.740> the<00:00:19.370> piece<00:00:19.640> of<00:00:19.820> slide<00:00:20.090> apart

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:20.510 
that who makes the piece of slide apart

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:24.940 
that who makes the piece of slide apart
or<00:00:21.130> jump<00:00:22.130> or<00:00:22.550> twist<00:00:23.029> or<00:00:23.720> warp<00:00:24.290> when<00:00:24.529> you<00:00:24.650> get<00:00:24.800> so

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:24.950 
or jump or twist or warp when you get so

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:26.740 
or jump or twist or warp when you get so
many<00:00:25.130> of<00:00:25.250> them<00:00:25.369> when<00:00:25.460> using<00:00:25.670> the<00:00:26.000> bark<00:00:26.450> plant

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:26.750 
many of them when using the bark plant

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:30.010 
many of them when using the bark plant
but<00:00:27.590> keep<00:00:27.740> up<00:00:27.860> with<00:00:28.010> this<00:00:28.100> YBF<00:00:28.760> hit<00:00:29.000> it<00:00:29.180> kicking

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:30.020 
but keep up with this YBF hit it kicking

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:32.230 
but keep up with this YBF hit it kicking
around<00:00:30.110> my<00:00:30.500> head<00:00:30.680> for<00:00:30.890> a<00:00:30.919> while<00:00:31.130> this<00:00:32.029> one's

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:32.240 
around my head for a while this one's

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:35.200 
around my head for a while this one's
kind<00:00:32.450> of<00:00:32.540> crude<00:00:32.810> it<00:00:32.990> does<00:00:33.170> work<00:00:33.940> works<00:00:34.940> good<00:00:35.180> I

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:35.210 
kind of crude it does work works good I

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:37.590 
kind of crude it does work works good I
like<00:00:35.450> a<00:00:35.630> better<00:00:35.930> version<00:00:36.200> of<00:00:36.500> it<00:00:36.650> with

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:37.600 
like a better version of it with

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.090 
like a better version of it with
hardware<00:00:38.600> or<00:00:38.720> something<00:00:39.050> but<00:00:39.260> this<00:00:39.710> is<00:00:39.890> how<00:00:40.040> it

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:40.100 
hardware or something but this is how it

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.370 
hardware or something but this is how it
works<00:00:40.340> I<00:00:40.579> basically<00:00:41.270> made<00:00:41.540> these<00:00:41.720> rails<00:00:42.020> out

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:42.380 
works I basically made these rails out

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:45.250 
works I basically made these rails out
of<00:00:42.560> old<00:00:43.340> two<00:00:43.579> by<00:00:43.760> fours<00:00:44.090> and<00:00:44.270> I<00:00:44.570> true<00:00:44.899> them<00:00:45.079> up

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:45.260 
of old two by fours and I true them up

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:49.750 
of old two by fours and I true them up
and<00:00:47.440> look<00:00:48.440> good<00:00:48.620> at<00:00:48.800> design<00:00:49.130> I<00:00:49.160> made<00:00:49.490> them<00:00:49.640> all

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:49.760 
and look good at design I made them all

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.840 
and look good at design I made them all
the<00:00:49.910> same<00:00:50.500> all<00:00:51.500> the<00:00:51.560> holes<00:00:51.980> that<00:00:52.220> I<00:00:52.370> drill<00:00:52.640> that

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:52.850 
the same all the holes that I drill that

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:55.570 
the same all the holes that I drill that
girl<00:00:53.150> I<00:00:53.810> used<00:00:54.080> inks<00:00:54.620> on<00:00:54.770> the<00:00:54.950> drill<00:00:55.160> press<00:00:55.190> so

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:55.580 
girl I used inks on the drill press so

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:56.890 
girl I used inks on the drill press so
everything<00:00:55.940> was<00:00:56.120> exactly<00:00:56.270> in<00:00:56.780> the<00:00:56.870> right

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:56.900 
everything was exactly in the right

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:59.800 
everything was exactly in the right
place<00:00:57.380> and<00:00:58.010> you'll<00:00:58.130> see<00:00:58.370> why<00:00:58.580> in<00:00:58.790> a<00:00:58.850> second<00:00:59.300> but

00:00:59.800 --> 00:00:59.810 
place and you'll see why in a second but

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:03.550 
place and you'll see why in a second but
what<00:00:59.960> this<00:01:00.110> thing<00:01:00.320> does<00:01:01.450> it's<00:01:02.450> going<00:01:02.810> to<00:01:03.050> clamp

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:03.560 
what this thing does it's going to clamp

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:05.560 
what this thing does it's going to clamp
down<00:01:03.680> them<00:01:04.100> and<00:01:04.339> against<00:01:05.030> it<00:01:05.150> at<00:01:05.239> the<00:01:05.360> same

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:05.570 
down them and against it at the same

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:13.330 
down them and against it at the same
time<00:01:07.030> it<00:01:08.030> does<00:01:08.270> seem<00:01:08.509> to<00:01:08.659> work<00:01:10.659> I<00:01:12.009> have<00:01:13.009> spots

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:13.340 
time it does seem to work I have spots

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:15.850 
time it does seem to work I have spots
back<00:01:13.640> here<00:01:14.090> and<00:01:14.630> I'm<00:01:14.750> going<00:01:14.900> to<00:01:14.960> put<00:01:15.259> a<00:01:15.530> couple

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:15.860 
back here and I'm going to put a couple

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:18.880 
back here and I'm going to put a couple
little<00:01:16.009> more<00:01:16.250> shims<00:01:16.610> just<00:01:17.439> material<00:01:18.439> more

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:18.890 
little more shims just material more

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:21.580 
little more shims just material more
towards<00:01:19.250> the<00:01:19.370> middle<00:01:19.600> so<00:01:20.600> what<00:01:20.750> does<00:01:21.020> this

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:21.590 
towards the middle so what does this

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.120 
towards the middle so what does this
comes<00:01:21.890> down<00:01:22.130> here<00:01:22.400> like<00:01:22.550> this<00:01:23.530> put<00:01:24.530> a<00:01:24.560> pin<00:01:24.860> in

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.130 
comes down here like this put a pin in

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:31.860 
comes down here like this put a pin in
that<00:01:25.480> hole<00:01:26.480> like<00:01:26.780> that

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:31.870 

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:35.410 

by<00:01:32.870> the<00:01:32.930> way<00:01:33.140> I<00:01:33.170> have<00:01:33.500> a<00:01:33.970> packaging<00:01:34.970> tape<00:01:35.180> on

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:35.420 
by the way I have a packaging tape on

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:46.990 
by the way I have a packaging tape on
the<00:01:36.110> rail<00:01:36.560> so<00:01:36.950> the<00:01:40.990> cereal<00:01:41.990> that<00:01:45.820> goes<00:01:46.820> like

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:47.000 
the rail so the cereal that goes like

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.190 
the rail so the cereal that goes like
that<00:01:47.030> and<00:01:47.479> as<00:01:47.990> you<00:01:48.110> can<00:01:48.260> see<00:01:49.360> is<00:01:50.360> this<00:01:50.630> as<00:01:50.930> this

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
that and as you can see is this as this

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.440 
that and as you can see is this as this
moves<00:01:51.530> forward<00:01:51.680> it<00:01:52.310> will<00:01:52.370> clamp<00:01:52.640> this<00:01:52.880> down<00:01:52.940> so

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 
moves forward it will clamp this down so

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.270 
moves forward it will clamp this down so
I<00:01:53.479> need<00:01:53.810> something<00:01:54.049> to<00:01:54.170> push<00:01:54.409> these<00:01:55.010> together

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 
I need something to push these together

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:56.800 
I need something to push these together
so<00:01:55.760> this<00:01:55.940> is<00:01:56.030> what<00:01:56.180> I<00:01:56.210> use

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
so this is what I use

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.710 
so this is what I use
I<00:01:56.840> made<00:01:57.590> these<00:01:57.710> cans<00:01:58.130> and<00:01:58.549> then<00:01:59.479> you<00:01:59.570> got

00:01:59.710 --> 00:01:59.720 
I made these cans and then you got

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.260 
I made these cans and then you got
several<00:02:00.080> holes<00:02:00.290> to<00:02:00.530> choose<00:02:00.560> from<00:02:01.159> you<00:02:02.119> just

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270 
several holes to choose from you just

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.710 
several holes to choose from you just
put<00:02:02.540> this<00:02:02.720> in<00:02:02.780> here<00:02:03.110> like<00:02:03.170> this<00:02:04.630> find<00:02:05.630> the

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:05.720 
put this in here like this find the

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:09.100 
put this in here like this find the
right<00:02:05.869> hole<00:02:06.080> that<00:02:06.290> works<00:02:06.500> for<00:02:06.770> you<00:02:07.599> the<00:02:08.599> other

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110 
right hole that works for you the other

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:21.280 
right hole that works for you the other
side

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.380 

like<00:02:22.290> that<00:02:22.530> and<00:02:22.950> you<00:02:23.489> just<00:02:23.640> push<00:02:23.910> down<00:02:24.150> on<00:02:24.180> it

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
like that and you just push down on it

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.640 
like that and you just push down on it
like<00:02:24.599> this<00:02:25.700> so<00:02:26.700> what's<00:02:26.910> happening<00:02:27.390> is<00:02:27.650> pushing

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
like this so what's happening is pushing

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.000 
like this so what's happening is pushing
this<00:02:28.739> together<00:02:29.160> and<00:02:30.080> this<00:02:31.080> thing<00:02:31.440> is<00:02:31.590> pulling

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
this together and this thing is pulling

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:33.530 
this together and this thing is pulling
us<00:02:32.099> this<00:02:32.310> way<00:02:32.550> so<00:02:32.760> this<00:02:32.970> is<00:02:33.120> what's<00:02:33.300> pushing

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
us this way so this is what's pushing

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:41.059 
us this way so this is what's pushing
down<00:02:33.810> on<00:02:33.840> the<00:02:34.050> top<00:02:38.660> like<00:02:39.660> that<00:02:39.930> it's<00:02:40.769> ready<00:02:41.010> to

00:02:41.059 --> 00:02:41.069 
down on the top like that it's ready to

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:44.150 
down on the top like that it's ready to
go<00:02:41.239> keep<00:02:42.239> everything<00:02:42.569> straight<00:02:43.160> nothing

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
go keep everything straight nothing

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:48.770 
go keep everything straight nothing
slides<00:02:44.400> apart<00:02:44.910> and<00:02:46.610> pretty<00:02:47.610> tight<00:02:47.879> I<00:02:48.150> even

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
slides apart and pretty tight I even

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.780 
slides apart and pretty tight I even
consider<00:02:49.170> putting<00:02:49.440> another<00:02:49.680> barking<00:02:50.250> on<00:02:50.519> here

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
consider putting another barking on here

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.170 
consider putting another barking on here
just<00:02:51.000> just<00:02:51.840> a<00:02:52.019> hold<00:02:52.230> it<00:02:52.380> tighter<00:02:52.620> but<00:02:53.180> that's

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
just just a hold it tighter but that's

00:02:54.180 --> 00:03:09.080 
just just a hold it tighter but that's
it<00:02:55.610> for<00:02:56.610> a<00:02:56.640> while<00:03:04.129> anyway<00:03:07.849> okay<00:03:08.849> when<00:03:09.000> I<00:03:09.060> was

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
it for a while anyway okay when I was

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:10.759 
it for a while anyway okay when I was
checking<00:03:09.420> out<00:03:09.599> the<00:03:09.660> video<00:03:10.079> I<00:03:10.140> just<00:03:10.260> did<00:03:10.739> I

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:10.769 
checking out the video I just did I

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:12.740 
checking out the video I just did I
realized<00:03:11.549> I<00:03:11.700> didn't<00:03:11.970> get<00:03:12.120> the<00:03:12.239> whole<00:03:12.420> thing<00:03:12.690> in

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
realized I didn't get the whole thing in

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:16.130 
realized I didn't get the whole thing in
there<00:03:13.140> so<00:03:13.379> here's<00:03:14.040> a<00:03:14.160> better<00:03:14.400> view<00:03:14.549> of<00:03:14.879> it<00:03:15.239> you

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
there so here's a better view of it you

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:20.150 
there so here's a better view of it you
can<00:03:16.319> see<00:03:16.560> both<00:03:17.280> ends<00:03:17.879> there<00:03:18.090> have<00:03:18.480> the<00:03:19.160> bracket

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
can see both ends there have the bracket

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.970 
can see both ends there have the bracket
that<00:03:20.190> pull<00:03:20.730> it<00:03:20.910> down<00:03:21.290> there<00:03:22.290> parallel<00:03:22.829> with

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
that pull it down there parallel with

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:25.250 
that pull it down there parallel with
each<00:03:23.010> other<00:03:23.370> and<00:03:23.790> as<00:03:24.269> it<00:03:24.420> as<00:03:24.569> the<00:03:24.810> top<00:03:25.019> one

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
each other and as it as the top one

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.530 
each other and as it as the top one
pulls<00:03:25.650> to<00:03:25.950> the<00:03:25.980> right<00:03:26.069> it<00:03:26.579> pushes<00:03:27.060> down<00:03:27.090> on<00:03:27.299> the

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
pulls to the right it pushes down on the

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.379 
pulls to the right it pushes down on the
material<00:03:28.410> I<00:03:28.590> actually<00:03:29.430> have<00:03:29.730> the<00:03:30.180> wood

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:30.389 
material I actually have the wood

00:03:30.389 --> 00:03:32.240 
material I actually have the wood
clamped<00:03:30.930> in<00:03:31.079> there<00:03:31.260> and<00:03:31.380> glued<00:03:31.620> up<00:03:31.769> right<00:03:32.010> now

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
clamped in there and glued up right now

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:36.170 
clamped in there and glued up right now
and<00:03:33.319> it<00:03:34.319> holds<00:03:35.069> pretty<00:03:35.130> good<00:03:35.519> without<00:03:35.700> putting

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
and it holds pretty good without putting

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.059 
and it holds pretty good without putting
clamps<00:03:36.690> on<00:03:36.810> there<00:03:37.019> but<00:03:37.230> just<00:03:37.410> as<00:03:37.500> an<00:03:37.590> extra

00:03:38.059 --> 00:03:38.069 
clamps on there but just as an extra

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:40.729 
clamps on there but just as an extra
push<00:03:39.000> I<00:03:39.269> put<00:03:39.540> those<00:03:39.660> clamps<00:03:40.170> on<00:03:40.319> there<00:03:40.530> and<00:03:40.680> add

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:40.739 
push I put those clamps on there and add

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:42.979 
push I put those clamps on there and add
tighten<00:03:41.160> it<00:03:41.250> up<00:03:41.340> a<00:03:41.489> little<00:03:41.670> more<00:03:41.910> but<00:03:42.690> anyway

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:42.989 
tighten it up a little more but anyway

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:47.530 
tighten it up a little more but anyway
that's<00:03:43.819> it's<00:03:44.819> kind<00:03:45.030> of<00:03:45.090> a<00:03:45.209> better<00:03:45.420> view<00:03:45.780> of<00:03:45.810> it

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:47.540 
that's it's kind of a better view of it

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:51.139 
that's it's kind of a better view of it
that<00:03:48.540> helps<00:03:48.840> at<00:03:48.989> all
