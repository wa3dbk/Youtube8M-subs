microwave put it on 50% and then for
like<00:03:52.430> 25<00:03:52.850> seconds<00:03:53.359> and<00:03:53.540> then<00:03:54.200> it's<00:03:54.350> not<00:03:54.530> as

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:54.680 
like 25 seconds and then it's not as

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:57.390 
like 25 seconds and then it's not as
cold<00:03:54.920> and<00:03:55.510> that's<00:03:56.510> yummier

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:57.400
