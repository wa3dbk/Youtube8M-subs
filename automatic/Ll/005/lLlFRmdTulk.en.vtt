00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.379
 ladies and gentlemen, I was thinking 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:09.690
 here on Chapter 700 in the DeNoto 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:12.090
 last page before appearing on a 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.969
 final page so the ration that is equal 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:17.460
 was equal to the first page of the manga 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:20.760
 appeared the grandpa's meats monument in 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:23.880
 at the moment saw her buildings as well as 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:26.340
 in the mourning sauna there was a computer 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.619
 this led to an issue that in fact I 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.529
 I have had this question since the beginning of 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:34.079
 Naruto at what time is it? 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.149
 Naruto because it's in the beginning they lived 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:39.660
 in a village in the village everything else but already 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:43.320
 had electricity already had light and now 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:46.320
 they have computers and have buildings 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.670
 I searched the internet for 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.710
 see when this industrialization began 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.559
 and I took into consideration some 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.629
 factors that this is all ax 9 thousand in 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.879
 already had nails where they could 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:59.190
 well there were buildings 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.980
 then this industrialization a thousand already 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.710
 existed there in the world of naruto she just did not 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.630
 had arrived until while still in Japan 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.700
 of today there is even with all the 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.310
 development and Japan still exist 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.500
 colon- like villages still exist 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.729
 better informed with common and I went 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.470
 give a researched when was it 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.000
 industrialization has already begun because 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.409
 people know that with industrialization the 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.650
 the company also then 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:28.290
 more industries more buildings this is it here 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:30.540
 here is from 1955 to 1973 the growth 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.610
 Japanese industry was the landmark of the 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.920
 States and Western Europe which 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.659
 demonstrates the effectiveness of the 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.360
 states in the reorganization of the 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:42.360
 occurred in the post-war period 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:45.930
 I was analyzing and the facts 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:48.600
 can we associate the fourth 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:52.470
 ninja war with the second war 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:55.619
 world and if we can associate 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:58.530
 will it be that the fight happens in the same time 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:00.390
 here in 1955 is this new 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.240
 part after wins this war was so 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.700
 serious that does not happen in three years 1900 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:08.220
 and 2000 or will be what happens before 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.520
 I'm looking at this, I'm doing this. 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.640
 association I believe that 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:16.390
 It was intentional that this ideology 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:18.370
 knows to put there the water fourth war 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:19.720
 world with that day the date with 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:21.610
 world war ii 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.950
 I want fourth world war where there is 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:26.260
 two days so it would be more of the same 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:29.200
 then my sex in my vision in the 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:33.100
 My design is naruto in this 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.760
 between 1940 and 1960 more or less 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:36.430
 around 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:39.070
 between 1900 and 2000 when he said in 1940 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:42.400
 1960, decreasing that date but realizing 

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:44.920
 I do not know if it's ever been said in 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.330
