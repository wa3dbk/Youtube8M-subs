00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:17.410 
going to go through a whole bunch of

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:18.810 
going to go through a whole bunch of

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:23.650 
simplest to a couple of other more fancy

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:25.259 
simplest to a couple of other more fancy
patterns<00:00:24.040> so<00:00:24.490> we're<00:00:24.820> not<00:00:24.910> going<00:00:25.060> to<00:00:25.150> be<00:00:25.210> doing

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:25.269 
patterns so we're not going to be doing

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:26.759 
patterns so we're not going to be doing
any<00:00:25.510> dancing<00:00:25.689> today<00:00:26.109> I'm<00:00:26.230> just<00:00:26.439> kind<00:00:26.590> of<00:00:26.650> put

what I'm doing so I'm gonna be using a

00:00:32.769 --> 00:00:35.220 
what I'm doing so I'm gonna be using a
Sayyidi<00:00:33.550> rhythm<00:00:34.239> track<00:00:34.510> that's<00:00:34.720> about<00:00:34.989> 80

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:35.230 
Sayyidi rhythm track that's about 80

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:37.470 
Sayyidi rhythm track that's about 80
beats<00:00:35.530> per<00:00:35.710> minute<00:00:36.190> and<00:00:36.460> I'm<00:00:36.970> just<00:00:37.150> gonna<00:00:37.269> go

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:37.480 
beats per minute and I'm just gonna go

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.479 
beats per minute and I'm just gonna go
ahead<00:00:37.720> and<00:00:37.870> put<00:00:38.019> that<00:00:38.170> on<00:00:38.350> and<00:00:38.800> then<00:00:38.830> you<00:00:39.339> can

00:00:39.479 --> 00:00:39.489 
ahead and put that on and then you can

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:40.860 
ahead and put that on and then you can
go<00:00:39.640> ahead<00:00:39.730> and<00:00:39.970> you<00:00:40.030> can<00:00:40.059> just<00:00:40.360> follow<00:00:40.480> along

go ahead and you can just follow along

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:43.110 
go ahead and you can just follow along
with<00:00:41.079> me<00:00:41.260> and<00:00:41.530> copy<00:00:42.160> some<00:00:42.280> of<00:00:42.430> these<00:00:42.610> patterns

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:43.120 
with me and copy some of these patterns

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:44.639 
with me and copy some of these patterns
and<00:00:43.360> then<00:00:43.600> you<00:00:43.719> can<00:00:43.840> take<00:00:44.020> these<00:00:44.200> patterns

00:00:44.639 --> 00:00:44.649 
and then you can take these patterns

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:47.700 
and then you can take these patterns
into<00:00:44.950> your<00:00:45.879> when<00:00:46.570> you<00:00:46.660> want<00:00:46.989> to<00:00:47.050> put<00:00:47.230> zil's<00:00:47.469> on

top of your movement and use some of

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:51.750 
top of your movement and use some of
these<00:00:50.289> patterns<00:00:50.559> as<00:00:50.829> examples<00:00:51.309> like<00:00:51.460> I<00:00:51.489> said

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:51.760 
these patterns as examples like I said

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.010 
these patterns as examples like I said
we're<00:00:51.879> going<00:00:52.000> to<00:00:52.059> go<00:00:52.149> from<00:00:52.270> the<00:00:52.480> super<00:00:52.840> super

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:53.020

there's<00:02:40.680> a<00:02:40.740> pattern

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:04.850 

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:08.720 

what<00:04:05.850> okay<00:04:06.840> so<00:04:06.930> I<00:04:07.020> look<00:04:07.230> like<00:04:07.530> that<00:04:07.770> so<00:04:08.550> there

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730 
what okay so I look like that so there

what okay so I look like that so there
are<00:04:08.820> some<00:04:08.940> ideas<00:04:09.390> for<00:04:09.570> how<00:04:09.690> you<00:04:09.750> can<00:04:09.990> work<00:04:10.200> with

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:10.260 
are some ideas for how you can work with

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.800 
are some ideas for how you can work with
Sadie<00:04:10.680> and<00:04:11.130> just<00:04:11.370> very<00:04:11.670> very<00:04:11.700> simple<00:04:12.150> ways<00:04:12.510> and

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810 
Sadie and just very very simple ways and

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:14.750 
Sadie and just very very simple ways and
then<00:04:13.230> bring<00:04:13.830> it<00:04:13.950> up<00:04:14.070> into<00:04:14.430> some<00:04:14.640> more

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:14.760 
then bring it up into some more

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:16.820 
then bring it up into some more
ornaments<00:04:15.150> and<00:04:15.390> patterns<00:04:15.780> so<00:04:16.170> when<00:04:16.410> you<00:04:16.620> are

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:16.830 
ornaments and patterns so when you are

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:18.920 
ornaments and patterns so when you are
dancing<00:04:17.330> improvisationally<00:04:18.330> a<00:04:18.360> lot<00:04:18.630> of<00:04:18.720> times

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:18.930 
dancing improvisationally a lot of times

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:21.170 
dancing improvisationally a lot of times
you<00:04:19.200> need<00:04:19.440> to<00:04:19.950> kind<00:04:20.430> of<00:04:20.549> ease<00:04:20.730> yourself<00:04:20.820> into

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 
you need to kind of ease yourself into

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.210 
you need to kind of ease yourself into
what's<00:04:21.600> going<00:04:21.690> on<00:04:22.020> especially<00:04:22.230> if<00:04:22.860> you

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:23.220 
what's going on especially if you

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:26.000 
what's going on especially if you
playing<00:04:24.000> your<00:04:24.150> zil's<00:04:24.390> along<00:04:24.870> with<00:04:25.290> dancing<00:04:25.830> is

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:26.010 
playing your zil's along with dancing is

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:28.070 
playing your zil's along with dancing is
a<00:04:26.340> newer<00:04:26.730> skill<00:04:27.150> for<00:04:27.390> you<00:04:27.510> or<00:04:27.690> one<00:04:27.870> you're

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:28.080 
a newer skill for you or one you're

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.560 
a newer skill for you or one you're
trying<00:04:28.350> to<00:04:28.530> refine<00:04:28.890> so<00:04:29.610> that<00:04:30.060> I<00:04:30.240> always

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:30.570 
trying to refine so that I always

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:32.510 
trying to refine so that I always
recommend<00:04:30.930> to<00:04:30.990> people<00:04:31.050> that<00:04:31.470> start<00:04:32.340> it<00:04:32.460> up

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:32.520 
recommend to people that start it up

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.190 
recommend to people that start it up
just<00:04:32.820> was<00:04:33.090> kind<00:04:33.360> of<00:04:33.420> just<00:04:33.600> getting<00:04:33.660> right<00:04:34.050> on

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:34.200 
just was kind of just getting right on

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:35.990 
just was kind of just getting right on
the<00:04:34.320> beat<00:04:34.500> and<00:04:34.710> then<00:04:34.830> ease<00:04:35.220> into<00:04:35.490> your<00:04:35.640> rhythm

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:36.000 
the beat and then ease into your rhythm

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000 
the beat and then ease into your rhythm
a<00:04:36.030> little<00:04:36.120> bit<00:04:36.420> bring<00:04:36.690> it<00:04:36.870> up<00:04:37.020> and<00:04:37.320> use<00:04:37.740> that

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:38.010 
a little bit bring it up and use that

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:40.670 
a little bit bring it up and use that
music<00:04:38.610> the<00:04:39.480> intensity<00:04:39.990> of<00:04:40.080> the<00:04:40.170> music<00:04:40.200> and<00:04:40.590> the
