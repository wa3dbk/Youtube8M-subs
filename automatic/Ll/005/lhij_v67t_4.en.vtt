late august or late some timer sorry and

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.150 
late august or late some timer sorry and
then<00:00:14.849> so<00:00:15.719> here's<00:00:15.960> the<00:00:16.109> board<00:00:16.320> it's<00:00:16.920> actually

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
then so here's the board it's actually

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.060 
then so here's the board it's actually
midway<00:00:17.760> through<00:00:18.000> a<00:00:18.029> game<00:00:18.300> right<00:00:18.480> now<00:00:18.560> but<00:00:19.560> the

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
midway through a game right now but the

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.160 
midway through a game right now but the
basic<00:00:20.400> premise<00:00:20.550> is<00:00:20.880> you<00:00:21.119> want<00:00:21.270> to<00:00:21.420> explore

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
basic premise is you want to explore

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.370 
basic premise is you want to explore
these<00:00:22.710> ruins<00:00:23.160> purple<00:00:23.699> white<00:00:24.150> blue<00:00:24.570> ruins<00:00:25.109> and

these ruins purple white blue ruins and
you<00:00:25.980> want<00:00:26.160> to<00:00:26.310> build<00:00:26.640> pathways<00:00:27.150> and<00:00:27.480> once<00:00:28.349> a

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
you want to build pathways and once a

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.730 
you want to build pathways and once a
once<00:00:28.920> a<00:00:29.099> ruin<00:00:29.340> has<00:00:29.490> been<00:00:29.640> completely<00:00:30.090> explored

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:30.740 
once a ruin has been completely explored

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:34.459 
once a ruin has been completely explored
you'll<00:00:31.740> have<00:00:31.920> a<00:00:32.059> relic<00:00:33.059> pop-up<00:00:33.450> and<00:00:34.200> what<00:00:34.380> will

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
you'll have a relic pop-up and what will

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.790 
you'll have a relic pop-up and what will
happen<00:00:34.770> is<00:00:34.890> say<00:00:35.070> you<00:00:35.130> have<00:00:35.370> two<00:00:35.969> relics<00:00:36.800> say

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
happen is say you have two relics say

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.889 
happen is say you have two relics say
one<00:00:38.010> here<00:00:38.370> one<00:00:38.700> here<00:00:38.730> you're<00:00:39.629> going<00:00:39.750> to<00:00:39.809> want

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
one here one here you're going to want

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.750 
one here one here you're going to want
to<00:00:40.020> have<00:00:40.170> pathways<00:00:40.680> connecting<00:00:41.610> those<00:00:41.700> two

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
to have pathways connecting those two

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.450 
to have pathways connecting those two
relics<00:00:42.360> you<00:00:42.780> can<00:00:42.930> start<00:00:43.200> on<00:00:43.350> on<00:00:44.100> your<00:00:44.250> turn

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
relics you can start on on your turn

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.940 
relics you can start on on your turn
start<00:00:44.789> on<00:00:44.879> a<00:00:44.910> relic<00:00:45.270> make<00:00:46.170> a<00:00:46.200> relic<00:00:46.530> run<00:00:46.739> and

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
start on a relic make a relic run and

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.470 
start on a relic make a relic run and
then<00:00:47.190> you<00:00:47.280> get<00:00:47.399> to<00:00:47.430> grab<00:00:47.670> the<00:00:47.789> relic<00:00:48.059> and<00:00:48.180> so

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
then you get to grab the relic and so

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.840 
then you get to grab the relic and so
the<00:00:48.660> premise<00:00:48.930> of<00:00:49.020> the<00:00:49.110> game<00:00:49.140> is<00:00:49.590> to<00:00:49.700> grab<00:00:50.700> as

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
the premise of the game is to grab as

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.170 
the premise of the game is to grab as
many<00:00:50.969> different<00:00:51.390> kind<00:00:51.570> of<00:00:51.629> relics<00:00:51.960> as<00:00:52.110> you<00:00:52.199> can

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:53.180 
many different kind of relics as you can

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:55.580 
many different kind of relics as you can
you<00:00:54.180> know<00:00:54.270> move<00:00:54.539> efficiently<00:00:55.020> across<00:00:55.230> the

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
you know move efficiently across the

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.810 
you know move efficiently across the
board<00:00:55.829> by<00:00:55.980> creating<00:00:56.370> pathways<00:00:56.579> into

00:00:58.810 --> 00:00:58.820 
board by creating pathways into

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.220 
board by creating pathways into
basically<00:00:59.820> who<00:01:00.090> wins<00:01:00.329> is<00:01:00.539> who<00:01:00.719> has<00:01:00.989> the<00:01:01.109> most

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
basically who wins is who has the most

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.619 
basically who wins is who has the most
victory<00:01:01.649> points<00:01:01.680> so<00:01:02.250> whoever<00:01:03.239> has<00:01:03.420> the<00:01:03.510> most

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
victory points so whoever has the most

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.810 
victory points so whoever has the most
victory<00:01:04.019> points<00:01:04.049> wins<00:01:04.890> you<00:01:05.489> do<00:01:05.610> that<00:01:05.760> by

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
victory points wins you do that by

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.480 
victory points wins you do that by
getting<00:01:06.090> relics<00:01:06.570> making<00:01:07.020> relic<00:01:07.979> runs<00:01:08.220> the

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
getting relics making relic runs the

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.850 
getting relics making relic runs the
longer<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:08.909> run<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.869> more<00:01:09.900> pathways<00:01:10.260> you<00:01:10.619> use

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
longer the run the more pathways you use

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.340 
longer the run the more pathways you use
the<00:01:11.040> more<00:01:11.189> points<00:01:11.430> you<00:01:11.520> get<00:01:12.020> there<00:01:13.020> is<00:01:13.110> another

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
the more points you get there is another

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.499 
the more points you get there is another
way<00:01:13.530> of<00:01:13.560> making<00:01:13.979> points<00:01:14.189> you<00:01:14.490> every<00:01:15.119> blue

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
way of making points you every blue

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.289 
way of making points you every blue
temple<00:01:15.869> is<00:01:16.020> victory<00:01:16.439> points<00:01:16.830> only<00:01:17.009> and<00:01:17.400> there

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
temple is victory points only and there

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.870 
temple is victory points only and there
are<00:01:18.390> other<00:01:18.799> other<00:01:19.799> ways<00:01:20.040> to<00:01:20.220> make<00:01:20.369> points<00:01:20.759> as

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
are other other ways to make points as

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:26.960 
are other other ways to make points as
well<00:01:21.030> so<00:01:22.280> yeah<00:01:23.280> and<00:01:24.110> yep<00:01:25.110> so<00:01:25.590> the<00:01:25.830> there<00:01:26.820> are

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
well so yeah and yep so the there are

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.840 
well so yeah and yep so the there are
tools<00:01:27.350> so<00:01:28.350> every<00:01:28.770> time<00:01:28.799> you<00:01:29.100> cross<00:01:29.490> the<00:01:29.700> path

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
tools so every time you cross the path

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.260 
tools so every time you cross the path
with<00:01:30.119> a<00:01:30.320> tool<00:01:31.320> token<00:01:31.740> flip<00:01:32.610> the<00:01:32.700> token<00:01:33.000> over

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
with a tool token flip the token over

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.819 
with a tool token flip the token over
and<00:01:33.450> you<00:01:33.659> get<00:01:33.780> to<00:01:33.840> move<00:01:33.930> your<00:01:34.079> toolbox<00:01:34.470> on<00:01:34.650> one

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
and you get to move your toolbox on one

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:38.240 
and you get to move your toolbox on one
of<00:01:34.920> these<00:01:35.009> three<00:01:35.390> progressions<00:01:37.040> this<00:01:38.040> one

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
of these three progressions this one

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.870 
of these three progressions this one
basically<00:01:38.670> is<00:01:39.000> the<00:01:39.390> ration<00:01:39.750> progression<00:01:40.880> this

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
basically is the ration progression this

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.710 
basically is the ration progression this
one<00:01:42.060> is<00:01:42.210> pathway<00:01:42.689> movement<00:01:43.170> and<00:01:43.320> this<00:01:43.590> one<00:01:43.829> is

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:44.720 
one is pathway movement and this one is

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:47.630 
one is pathway movement and this one is
just<00:01:45.720> another<00:01:46.170> progression<00:01:46.799> for<00:01:47.310> victory

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
just another progression for victory

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.280 
just another progression for victory
points<00:01:48.000> are<00:01:48.119> for<00:01:48.149> creating<00:01:48.899> more<00:01:49.049> pathways

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
points are for creating more pathways

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.500 
points are for creating more pathways
but<00:01:50.689> so<00:01:51.799> yeah

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:53.510 
but so yeah

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:56.410 
but so yeah
those<00:01:54.080> are<00:01:54.230> the<00:01:54.320> basic<00:01:55.100> concepts<00:01:55.670> also

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:56.420 
those are the basic concepts also

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.130 
those are the basic concepts also
rations<00:01:57.580> this<00:01:58.580> is<00:01:58.730> home<00:01:58.910> base<00:01:58.940> you<00:01:59.780> come<00:01:59.990> back

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.140 
rations this is home base you come back

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:01.630 
rations this is home base you come back
here<00:02:00.350> to<00:02:00.470> get<00:02:00.560> more<00:02:00.710> rations<00:02:01.190> when<00:02:01.400> you<00:02:01.460> run

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:01.640 
here to get more rations when you run

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.790 
here to get more rations when you run
out<00:02:01.670> on<00:02:02.000> the<00:02:02.090> field<00:02:02.440> you<00:02:03.440> spend<00:02:03.680> your<00:02:03.710> whole

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:03.800 
out on the field you spend your whole

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:05.650 
out on the field you spend your whole
turn<00:02:04.100> getting<00:02:04.400> rations<00:02:04.820> you<00:02:04.910> get<00:02:05.030> 3<00:02:05.210> rations

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:05.660 
turn getting rations you get 3 rations

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:07.900 
turn getting rations you get 3 rations
every<00:02:05.960> time<00:02:06.170> you<00:02:06.830> want<00:02:06.980> to<00:02:07.070> explore<00:02:07.430> a<00:02:07.490> temple

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:07.910 
every time you want to explore a temple
