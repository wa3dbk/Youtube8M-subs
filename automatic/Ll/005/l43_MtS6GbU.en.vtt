00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:16.439
 the state offers the ski cross-country skiing 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.869
 possibility very specific too 

00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:19.980
 train his training 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:23.000
 monitor performance-related data 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.740
 the fitness oriented athlete 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.410
 he provides the possibility of 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.689
 perfect full-body workout important 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:36.390
 for both is the best possible 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:39.210
 Execution of the technology before it starts 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:42.589
 Do you take the grip loosen the hand of 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:45.809
 little finger is on the bottom edge 

00:00:42.589 --> 00:00:47.549
 The train then starts to hit the hands 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.860
 at about eye level are the poor 

00:00:47.549 --> 00:00:52.229
 it is very important to bend right now 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.119
 here the maximum voltage too 

00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:55.769
 to reach 

00:00:53.119 --> 00:01:00.030
 because if I do not have it then it will 

00:00:55.769 --> 00:01:01.739
 the shop simply says I have nothing 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.119
 that the force works against me 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.840
 need really great hull here 

00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:09.740
 tension to the full force on the 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.740
 to bring machine 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:19.320
 the shooter below the knee arms 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.659
 are now completely stretched and now 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.700
 it starts to set up at the same time 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.320
 Upper body with the research of the arms 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.210
 then I'm back in the 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:46.020
 starting position and ready for the 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:48.240
 next thrust interesting for the ski 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.119
 cross-country skiing is the possibility at the ski 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.580
 to draw diagonally 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:58.950
 important in the regional train the entire 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:02:01.729
 to use the arms of the poor stable 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:04.289
 are not to be canceled 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:09.080
 as a clue you can then just 

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:09.080
 always look through the v of the factory 

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:35.900
 you pull at the start with high frequency 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:37.889
 one trains the cardiovascular system 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:40.109
 you focus on as possible 

00:02:37.889 --> 00:02:49.290
 big impulse of power one promotes the 

00:02:40.109 --> 00:02:50.459
 Muscle gain much frequency of 60 trains 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:55.349
 per minute 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:57.930
 she was doing 240 watts it is important to 

00:02:55.349 --> 00:03:01.489
 look that early again 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:04.200
 front comes at the frequency high times 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:13.439
 the high frequency that is a perfect 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:14.900
 Cardiovascular training in contrast 

00:03:13.439 --> 00:03:18.120
 to 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:23.599
 is the low frequency 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:29.849
 the impulse 7 perfect for the guest 

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:36.170
 I draw a 30s frequency and 

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:36.170
 try again this 240 watts too rich 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:51.540
 you see the track is an all-round 

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:53.910
 successful training machine 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:56.810
 whether now there are no more excuses 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:56.810
 not to exercise
