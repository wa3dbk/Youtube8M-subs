00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.860
For the cakes that we're going to decorate
today, you're going to of course start out

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:13.110
with the cake.

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:18.220
You can either use a box recipe that you can
purchase at any supermarket or if you have

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:22.450
that great recipe at home, you can make your
cake from scratch.

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:25.230
Then of course, you're going to want to let
your cake cool.

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.220
I usually like to let my cake cool overnight
and then I'll work on it the following day.

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:34.781
So, you're going to decide if you want a two
layered cake, a three layered cake, if you

00:00:34.781 --> 00:00:37.960
want your cake to be round, if you want your
cake to be square.

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.840
It all depends on what you're making out of
the cake of course.

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:44.690
Then, you're going to want to layer your cake.

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:50.620
I usually make my cake into a three layer,
but I bake individual cakes.

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:53.960
If you want to make your cake a little higher
and then you want to torte it, which means

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:59.200
you want to cut your cake in half and then
fill it as opposed to using individual pieces,

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:00.559
then that's fine.

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:04.770
You want to put your cake together, you want
to give it a nice crumb coat so this way it

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:08.600
holds all the crumbs, which you see right
here I've already done.

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:15.029
This is going to help when you go to put on
the fresh coat of icing to decorate your cake.

00:01:15.029 --> 00:01:18.619
So once you've crumb coated, you want it to
sit in the fridge anywhere from forty-five

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:20.619
minutes, maybe to an hour.

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:22.590
It all depends on what you're going to do
with it.

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.340
If you're going to carve it out and make it
into a shape, you want to let it sit for maybe

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:31.200
up to two hours so it's nice and firm so you
can carve it out.

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.820
If you're going to keep it in its form, forty-five
minutes will be just fine.

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:40.869
Then you can take your cake out and then you
can ice it if you're going to keep it whole.

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:44.369
If you're going to carve it out, you're going
to want to carve out your shape, you want

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.380
to give it a second coating and then you're
going to want to put it back in the fridge

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.229
again and let it chill just a little while
longer.

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:55.460
This way you can prepare your fondant, you
can get all your tools together, and then

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:56.520
we can decorate our cake.
