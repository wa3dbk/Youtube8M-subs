00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:08.469
 to the girls today we are going to make a 

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:11.370
 very simple and original craft for 

00:00:08.469 --> 00:00:11.370
 the days of Christmas 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:18.529
 The materials that we will need are 

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:22.820
 scissors glue a pen or pencil 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:27.680
 green felt an ice cream stick 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:27.680
 colored buttons and a piece of string 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:37.980
 The first thing we have to do is 

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:37.980
 draw us a tree in the felt 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:44.210
 You can do it like 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:48.010
 as you want in this case I have drawn 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:48.010
 only two picks 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:01:02.190
 once we have drawn 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:02.190
 we take the scissors and cut them 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:12.900
 once we have the tree trimmed it 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.630
 let's put the trunk for it let's go 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:18.620
 to take the ice cream stick and we're going to 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.620
 split in half 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:29.800
 and I stayed more or less at the same height 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:31.590
 this does not matter because it's going to go by 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:34.460
 back side 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:38.170
 we turn around 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.170
 and pour a little glue 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:44.910
 and the test 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:55.409
 we wait for it to dry and we will return 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:58.409
 turn around 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:01.260
 and now let's take the buttons and the 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:05.610
 let's go hitting 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:08.490
 as we want to distribute them if they are 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:10.649
 very big buttons we can put 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:12.440
 few and prefer you can put more 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:14.480
 little 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:17.740
 and we paste them putting a little bit of 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.740
 glue on the button 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.870
 once we have all the buttons 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:31.510
 stuck 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:35.140
 and they are dry we are going to put him 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:37.510
 a hanger, we want to hang it in 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:39.780
 the tree or to decorate the house as 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:39.780
 remains 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:43.500
 with a piece of cord 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:47.280
 I threw the glue 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:53.980
 and we paste it with care 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:57.180
 it's a very simple craft that 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:03:01.909
 you can do with children 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:01.909
 to spend holiday evenings 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.329
 and we would have our Christmas tree 

00:03:04.159 --> 00:03:09.920
