a<00:01:49.740> nice<00:01:49.860> walkway<00:01:50.130> up<00:01:50.430> here<00:01:50.670> you<00:01:50.970> can<00:01:51.149> walk<00:01:51.360> hang

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
a nice walkway up here you can walk hang

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.230 
a nice walkway up here you can walk hang
out<00:01:52.409> and<00:01:52.740> I<00:01:53.280> guess<00:01:53.490> we're<00:01:53.670> going<00:01:53.759> to<00:01:53.820> go<00:01:53.970> down

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
out and I guess we're going to go down

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.109 
out and I guess we're going to go down
into<00:01:55.200> the<00:01:55.350> actual<00:01:55.710> park<00:01:56.070> I<00:01:56.310> didn't<00:01:56.969> there<00:01:57.060> was

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
into the actual park I didn't there was

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:58.880 
into the actual park I didn't there was
not<00:01:57.299> really<00:01:57.570> a<00:01:57.600> gate<00:01:57.930> so<00:01:58.170> i<00:01:58.200> guess<00:01:58.409> it's<00:01:58.619> free

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
not really a gate so i guess it's free

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.609 
not really a gate so i guess it's free
