00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:47.309 
of sugar
I<00:02:45.160> do<00:02:45.790> this<00:02:46.090> just<00:02:46.420> to<00:02:46.569> make<00:02:46.720> sure<00:02:46.750> it<00:02:47.110> gets

00:02:47.309 --> 00:02:47.319 
I do this just to make sure it gets

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:49.680 
I do this just to make sure it gets
mixed<00:02:47.560> in<00:02:47.769> there<00:02:47.950> evenly<00:02:48.519> if<00:02:49.239> you're<00:02:49.450> doing<00:02:49.569> it

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690 
mixed in there evenly if you're doing it

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:51.090 
mixed in there evenly if you're doing it
by<00:02:49.720> hand<00:02:50.080> you<00:02:50.200> definitely<00:02:50.650> want<00:02:50.769> to<00:02:50.830> do<00:02:50.950> this

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.100 
by hand you definitely want to do this

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:54.600 
by hand you definitely want to do this
but<00:02:51.430> if<00:02:51.549> you're<00:02:51.670> using<00:02:51.790> a<00:02:51.970> mixer<00:02:52.950> you<00:02:53.950> know<00:02:54.100> it

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 
but if you're using a mixer you know it

00:02:54.610 --> 00:04:16.729 
but if you're using a mixer you know it
usually<00:02:55.000> mixes<00:02:55.299> it<00:02:55.420> pretty<00:02:55.630> well

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:16.739 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:19.410 

make<00:04:17.739> sure<00:04:18.040> to<00:04:18.070> scrape<00:04:18.760> the<00:04:18.940> sides<00:04:18.970> of<00:04:19.330> the

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:19.420 
make sure to scrape the sides of the

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:27.840 
make sure to scrape the sides of the
bowl<00:04:19.600> with<00:04:19.630> the<00:04:19.870> spatula

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:27.850 

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:30.030 

so<00:04:28.510> in<00:04:28.840> a<00:04:28.930> separate<00:04:29.290> bowl<00:04:29.470> I'm<00:04:29.650> going<00:04:29.920> to

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:30.040 
so in a separate bowl I'm going to

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:32.070 
so in a separate bowl I'm going to
combine<00:04:30.250> the<00:04:30.670> salt<00:04:30.970> and<00:04:31.180> the<00:04:31.300> baking<00:04:31.480> powder

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:32.080 
combine the salt and the baking powder

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:36.450 
combine the salt and the baking powder
in<00:04:32.950> with<00:04:33.370> my<00:04:33.550> flour<00:04:33.840> and<00:04:35.160> then<00:04:36.160> I'm<00:04:36.280> going<00:04:36.400> to

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:36.460 
in with my flour and then I'm going to

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:40.530 
in with my flour and then I'm going to
add<00:04:36.640> that<00:04:36.910> to<00:04:37.380> the<00:04:38.380> chocolate<00:04:38.770> mixture<00:04:39.540> and

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:40.540 
add that to the chocolate mixture and

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:42.450 
add that to the chocolate mixture and
I'm<00:04:40.660> going<00:04:40.840> to<00:04:40.900> mix<00:04:41.050> that<00:04:41.170> all<00:04:41.470> together<00:04:41.650> until

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:42.460 
I'm going to mix that all together until

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:44.910 
I'm going to mix that all together until
it's<00:04:42.940> combined<00:04:43.380> you<00:04:44.380> don't<00:04:44.530> really<00:04:44.650> need<00:04:44.860> to

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:44.920 
it's combined you don't really need to

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:48.709 
it's combined you don't really need to
whip<00:04:45.220> it<00:04:45.450> because<00:04:46.450> it's<00:04:46.630> brownie<00:04:46.900> so

00:04:48.709 --> 00:04:48.719 
whip it because it's brownie so

00:04:48.719 --> 00:04:50.600 
whip it because it's brownie so
they<00:04:49.439> don't<00:04:49.589> really<00:04:49.679> need<00:04:49.860> to<00:04:50.009> be<00:04:50.129> Airy<00:04:50.369> they

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:50.610 
they don't really need to be Airy they

00:04:50.610 --> 00:05:00.660 
they don't really need to be Airy they
just<00:04:50.789> need<00:04:50.939> to<00:04:51.059> be<00:04:51.089> well<00:04:51.899> mixed

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:00.670 

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:03.610 

so<00:05:01.670> now<00:05:01.820> that<00:05:01.880> I've<00:05:02.120> mixed<00:05:02.480> the<00:05:03.080> brownie<00:05:03.470> mix

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:03.620 
so now that I've mixed the brownie mix

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:07.270 
so now that I've mixed the brownie mix
I'm<00:05:04.100> going<00:05:04.460> to<00:05:04.670> prepare<00:05:05.180> a<00:05:05.240> 9<00:05:05.750> by<00:05:05.900> 12<00:05:06.140> pan<00:05:06.410> by

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:07.280 
I'm going to prepare a 9 by 12 pan by

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:10.380 
I'm going to prepare a 9 by 12 pan by
first<00:05:07.610> greasing<00:05:08.480> it<00:05:08.600> with<00:05:09.380> Crisco<00:05:09.650> or<00:05:10.070> butter

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:10.390 
first greasing it with Crisco or butter

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:15.520 
first greasing it with Crisco or butter
and<00:05:11.390> then<00:05:11.750> flowering<00:05:12.440> it<00:05:12.910> and<00:05:14.110> this<00:05:15.110> will<00:05:15.290> just

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:15.530 
and then flowering it and this will just

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:17.830 
and then flowering it and this will just
prevent<00:05:15.950> any<00:05:16.160> sticking<00:05:16.880> and<00:05:17.120> I'm<00:05:17.420> going<00:05:17.690> to

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:17.840 
prevent any sticking and I'm going to

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:25.170 
prevent any sticking and I'm going to
take<00:05:18.140> out<00:05:18.260> the<00:05:18.410> brownies<00:05:18.770> from<00:05:18.950> the<00:05:19.070> pan

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:25.180 

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:28.660 

so<00:05:26.180> once<00:05:26.480> the<00:05:26.780> brownie<00:05:27.170> batter<00:05:27.470> is<00:05:27.800> mixed<00:05:28.310> you

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:28.670 
so once the brownie batter is mixed you

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:31.050 
so once the brownie batter is mixed you
can<00:05:28.700> go<00:05:29.150> ahead<00:05:29.240> and<00:05:29.450> pour<00:05:29.660> it<00:05:29.690> in<00:05:29.840> the<00:05:29.960> pan<00:05:30.170> and

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:31.060 
can go ahead and pour it in the pan and

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:44.190 
can go ahead and pour it in the pan and
smooth<00:05:32.060> it<00:05:32.210> out<00:05:32.300> a<00:05:32.360> bit<00:05:32.510> on<00:05:32.750> top<00:05:32.960> so<00:05:33.200> it's<00:05:33.350> even

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:44.200 

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:50.050 

cook<00:05:45.200> it<00:05:45.380> in<00:05:45.560> a<00:05:45.850> 350-degree<00:05:46.850> oven<00:05:47.330> for<00:05:48.700> 30<00:05:49.700> to
