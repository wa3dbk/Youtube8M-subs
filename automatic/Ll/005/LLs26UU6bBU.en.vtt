00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:08.910
 but I can see you see very well based 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:11.610
 on the car that goes away from juventus 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.200
 and of attention that prohibits radio radio 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.210
 times time and sometimes it comes to me 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.160
 stellino so fired is a 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.020
 mixture as max and today is brown 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.630
 twice from the ball I had to say 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:24.269
 the thing will say but no longer plays for us 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.160
 the moment attention walk on 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.779
 strait ships a lot because then I want to 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.430
 look at the road that will speak tonight 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:34.260
 a little this should always be given better 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:35.940
 You are disassembling the cases machine 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.010
 desperate because tomorrow there will be no 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.989
 my service now dias and from 13 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.540
 being me at the tgcom all morning 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:46.230
 altan domi and now I have become of the 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:48.030
 44 to 5 45 tomorrow morning for 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.489
 go to the tgcom appointment from a 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.510
 fourth from 844 10 as much as 11 4 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:57.960
 noon a quarter to one if 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:01:00.059
 something to the exact numbers tgcom24 channels 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.920
 51 of digital terrestrial is fine ok 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.019
 then he said this abruptly 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.119
 chest that I would have done the good service 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.600
 so people won't commit suicide 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:13.439
 data will start previewing what it is 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:16.530
 embrace is 12 helmets in these cases 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:18.450
 it is always said that he expects one 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.880
 response from a team coming out of one 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.909
 big disappointment in these cases 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.510
 answers can be of two types 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:26.950
 hardly the middle way 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:29.680
 then there is a kind of meltdown 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:31.450
 psychological then there is a little reaction 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:32.050
 as after the defeat of juve a 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.350
 Florence 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:38.650
 I would say that this evening's juve has 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:40.330
 replied tonight a life with 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:43.720
 stony because we can make gods 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:45.160
 specific temporal references the juve 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:48.520
 against Sassuolo gave the demonstration 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:52.690
 of a great team compactness of 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:54.970
 a great spirit of reaction 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:56.320
 asamoah said it we talked between 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:59.350
 we said we had to 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:01.660
 react immediately and this did 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:03.010
 actually the juve beyond the 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:05.140
 a circumstance that saw her opposed 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:08.020
 infact 4 to 0 against the pebble 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:10.420
 that exact opposite to an opposite school 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:11.890
 a strenuous resistance indeed a note 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:14.320
 the team that suffered several times was 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:15.610
 the team he had stopped will not have 

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:17.170
 rome on their field 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:20.080
 the impression from the other that pebble 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:22.420
 I'm not that name 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:23.890
 disputed the soul in the field and no but it is 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:27.070
 was then let's say what it is 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:27.610
 we immediately said so put to 

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:29.739
 ropes 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:31.540
 this is from the start of a tie for the juve that 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:33.760
 always came first on all the balloons 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:35.770
 with vidal 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:39.610
 according to me played a beautiful one 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:41.080
 match even if you haven't scored with 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:43.410
 stern that 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:45.580
 and therefore rather free to act then 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:47.350
 not wrong could be the 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:49.510
 unlike what happened to 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:52.240
 istanbul for those who have made few of them 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:55.710
 consent you have made few patents and 

00:02:52.240 --> 00:03:01.570
 a player who does not therefore mark how 

00:02:55.710 --> 00:03:03.310
 which does not mark but gave its own 

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:08.740
 career but would indeed 6 I know 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:10.570
 really beyond have jokes 

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:12.460
 also of a certain freedom or 

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:14.170
 quietly below altitude but all 

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:17.080
 live played fluently and clearly 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:20.260
 that when the games are born with these 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:23.500
 with these features and then the 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:27.010
 the technical gap between the rest does 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:31.930
 two teams in this game's 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:34.660
 short evening closing 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:37.030
 I would say even on the net that we have gods 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:37.390
 tight set-up times , commissioning 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:40.510
 on air 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:42.040
 in closing I would say disappointment 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:43.770
 definitely the release of the champions 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:46.300
 how to deal with the europa league 

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:50.019
 tell me about this pseudo failure that 

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:53.350
 everyone talks about failure and see the 

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:55.159
 speech is that it would be a bit long not 

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:57.140
 pay but we have times 

00:03:55.159 --> 00:04:00.420
 very often in our category 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:03.510
 then category of journalists yes 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:05.819
 exceeds the reason but to sell the 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:06.629
 newspapers but to make a stir but for 

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:08.730
 make news 

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:11.629
 but to listen and then these 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:14.010
 days the word failure appeared 

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:16.220
 which seems totally out of place 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:19.259
 because if you can talk about failure 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:22.530
 of the juve season then that 

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:24.509
 this year it will reach the fourth fifth set 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:25.979
 stages in eighth place and not yes 

00:04:24.509 --> 00:04:28.949
 will not even qualify for the europa league 

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:30.840
 what will you have to talk about for these teams 

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:34.410
 with a partner 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:36.930
 then failure in the champions league 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:38.520
 very well and true a company like the 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:40.470
 juve that a team like la 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:42.030
 juve who doesn't even manage to do 7 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:44.099
 points in a champions league group 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:46.320
 failed on champions league round 

00:04:44.099 --> 00:04:48.380
 we perfectly agree that yes 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:51.090
 can say of failure of the season 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:52.949
 mixed but a risky little bit then 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:55.620
 I repeat are those distortions that derive 

00:04:52.949 --> 00:04:59.880
 unfortunately for many a few by some 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:01.590
 that carry out our trade and that a 

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:04.380
 day they go on repeating make a use 

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:07.710
 improper milan of terms in 

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:09.090
 terminology, thoughts and anything else 

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:10.530
 in short, they are looking at us as if 

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:12.389
 we were two paces from the car 

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:14.250
 let's even go and do it 

00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:15.389
 no no but we would say two parts 

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:17.880
 we are increases 

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:19.909
 wait for an aspect I must say has a non 

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:23.909
 I know my cat raffaele lacere again 

00:05:19.909 --> 00:05:25.610
 raffaele taxi driver in mine 

00:05:23.909 --> 00:05:28.860
 country 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:30.990
 and accompanied height to the last 

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:36.990
 trip accompanied by alliances goes 

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:39.650
 well in short my country and I greet you 

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:41.910
 mortar friends who look at us so many 

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:45.660
 represented this case by cinthia a 

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:46.310
 tar and then I think that is the last discounted 

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:48.990
 greeting 

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:50.760
 there is no leap in the field that one does not 

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:54.830
 conclude with a greeting to mag 

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:54.830
 bye bye bye bye
