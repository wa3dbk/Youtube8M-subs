00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:06.200
 theatrical forum workshops and a Swiss café 

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:08.270
 with live music are just some of 

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:10.100
 the surprises of the factory a center 

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:12.080
 cultural heritage of the city of Querétaro 

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:14.950
 took advantage of the industrial past of a 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:14.950
 huge property 

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:22.240
 we are very far from the historic center 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:25.270
 from Querétaro where some years ago 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:27.250
 a large industrial warehouse was working today 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:30.789
 It is a space that combines art the 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:33.969
 design and scenic experimentation 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:35.710
 the cultural center the factory is from 2004 

00:00:33.969 --> 00:00:38.240
 a recommendable meeting point in 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:41.780
 this great city 

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:45.950
 This was an old factory in the area 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:49.580
 industrial of the 70s and 80s querétaro is 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:52.310
 a factory that is almost 40 years old and 

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:54.430
 now it has been transformed into a center 

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:54.430
 cultural 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:00.820
 and the factory is a concept that brings together 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:02.800
 several options for leisure and 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:06.570
 it is mainly a space of 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.570
 training and exchange of ideas 

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:12.550
 look there there are let's say the concept of 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:15.550
 The factory is include different 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:18.960
 business of the private initiative 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:21.210
 they like to be close to the creative world 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:25.090
 then we have a store 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:27.640
 Mexican designers we have as part 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:29.770
 from the heart of the factory 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:31.900
 the forum that is a multiple forum where 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:34.900
 There are different activities especially 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:37.690
 theater is the factory classroom that is 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:39.580
 where all the all are concentrated 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:41.670
 workshops that is also a 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:44.770
 proposal that we wanted to maintain 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.950
 We have a coffee in addition to Wednesday 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:46.950
 jazz 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:52.130
 Like good coffee culture, the stage 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.200
 illuminates with the lights and rhythms of 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:56.930
 jazz every Wednesday when the 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.790
 night and although today is Friday we had the 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:01.010
 opportunity to enjoy this combo 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:04.690
 of blues a little taste of the festival of 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:04.690
 jazz and blues are miguel de allende 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:12.900
 At the bottom of the factory is the forum 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:15.709
 theater where the work is presented chrome 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:18.510
 written and directed by alonso barrier 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:20.340
 this staging puts in the light of 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.650
 the reflectors of pop culture in 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:25.020
 chilanga provenance and with a tone 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:27.090
 hesitant ruthlessly mocks 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:30.380
 the commonplaces of the 80s and 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.380
 certain musical work 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:36.360
 my heart is of light 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:36.360
 but I love them 

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:42.760
 three fundamental axes the arts 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:45.370

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:47.860
