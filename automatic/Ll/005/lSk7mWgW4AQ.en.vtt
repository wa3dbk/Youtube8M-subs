 I'm here with Tony Dabbs and we're looking at a Nike Covert Performance driver. 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.219
 Who's turning this to Tony? What type of player does it address? 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:21.480
 It can turn to many different. We actually see many of our pros 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.500
 show interest in this product. Rory plays with the tour but we have seen 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:33.220
 Almost 60 percent of the Tour players take it to themselves. It has a 460cc head 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:39.050
 who is more forgiving and it is open to all. It is a user-friendly cellar. You 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:44.200
 has explained to me that although the 460cc is large, it is visually great 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:49.180
 nice. When it is measured, does it still count as 460cc? Yes that is correct. 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:54.309
 When you buy this cell, it is full 

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:59.789
 out adjustable with a ceiling that suits everyone? Tell the viewer what happens. I can show 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:04.629
 You. Simply put, we have the backpack a hosel like 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:09.390
 has an adapter. The adapter shows the ceiling and it also shows the flat angle. I'm pulling 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:16.220
 it quickly apart so you can see how easy it is. Ok I take time. Fine fine. I 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:21.360
 is not super fast, but I've done it right every time. You can do this for a round, but also 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:28.360
 during the round? It is correct. What we have here is simple. We have 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:35.450
 two pieces here. It is easy to place your ceiling on the desired surface angle. In this 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:40.390
 In case I can set it to 10.5 and neutral, I press these two 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:46.860
 down here and here as well as the little line here and backside here. 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:53.860
 So we just have to pull this one up and set the two up, so we're going. 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:02.050
 Screw a little here and then you can see. How much should it be tightened? 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:07.750
 Can you hear that little click? There it is. It's like a gas cap. There is one 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:13.010
 Torque that has a small ratchet fixed, and when you hear a click. A little click. 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:17.450
 It's as simple as that, and you're ready. If it blows a little one day, 0: 02: 17,450,0: 02: 21,000 you can 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.970
 Adjust down to 8.5. But if you know you are out of reach 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.570
 you can turn the leopard and pull it back to the left post that closes 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:34.810
 the surface and eliminates some of it. It's great technology. We go out on the track 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:38.170
 in front of us here. It is beautiful so you have this year 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:41.310
 So we hope to see some of these drivers in play, but for now you have many thanks 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.340
 for your time Tony. It was so little.
