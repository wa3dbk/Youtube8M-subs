strongest finger the instinct is to

middle and then Ray have you had that

middle and then Ray have you had that
happened<00:02:39.810> where<00:02:39.900> the<00:02:39.989> ring<00:02:40.290> finger<00:02:40.769> is<00:02:40.830> that

very<00:02:45.660> common<00:02:47.150> one<00:02:48.150> way<00:02:48.299> around<00:02:48.630> that<00:02:48.750> is<00:02:49.019> to<00:02:49.049> is

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
very common one way around that is to is

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.830 
very common one way around that is to is
to<00:02:49.739> do<00:02:49.890> this<00:02:50.040> as<00:02:50.580> you<00:02:50.880> release<00:02:51.150> the<00:02:51.390> G<00:02:51.600> chord

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
to do this as you release the G chord

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.710 
to do this as you release the G chord
let<00:02:52.830> the<00:02:52.980> ring<00:02:53.340> finger<00:02:53.819> be<00:02:53.940> the<00:02:54.060> first<00:02:54.450> finger

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
let the ring finger be the first finger

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.880 
let the ring finger be the first finger
that<00:02:54.930> you<00:02:55.079> activate<00:02:55.590> so<00:02:55.890> let<00:02:56.250> it<00:02:56.489> come<00:02:56.880> up<00:02:56.910> to

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:57.890 
that you activate so let it come up to

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:01.610 
that you activate so let it come up to
the<00:02:58.890> fifth<00:02:59.160> string<00:02:59.280> and<00:02:59.870> as<00:03:00.870> it's<00:03:01.410> a

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
the fifth string and as it's a

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.530 
the fifth string and as it's a
approaching<00:03:02.610> the<00:03:02.880> fifth<00:03:03.090> string<00:03:03.269> and<00:03:03.420> ready

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
approaching the fifth string and ready

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.360 
approaching the fifth string and ready
to<00:03:03.750> drop<00:03:03.930> down<00:03:04.170> have<00:03:04.380> the<00:03:04.470> other<00:03:04.680> two<00:03:04.980> come

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
to drop down have the other two come

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.520 
to drop down have the other two come
into<00:03:05.579> their<00:03:05.760> position<00:03:06.209> you<00:03:06.870> may<00:03:07.049> well<00:03:07.260> want<00:03:07.410> to

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
into their position you may well want to

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:09.259 
into their position you may well want to
let<00:03:07.769> the<00:03:07.890> ring<00:03:08.100> finger<00:03:08.430> push<00:03:08.820> it<00:03:09.000> straight

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:09.269 
let the ring finger push it straight

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:11.270 
let the ring finger push it straight
down<00:03:09.510> first<00:03:09.930> and<00:03:10.170> then<00:03:10.260> the<00:03:10.590> other<00:03:10.739> to<00:03:10.980> follow

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
down first and then the other to follow

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.520 
down first and then the other to follow
so<00:03:12.060> initially<00:03:12.480> it<00:03:12.540> may<00:03:12.660> still<00:03:12.930> be<00:03:13.049> a<00:03:13.079> two-step

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
so initially it may still be a two-step

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:16.910 
so initially it may still be a two-step
process<00:03:14.090> as<00:03:15.090> your<00:03:15.359> G<00:03:15.570> up<00:03:16.290> comes<00:03:16.650> the<00:03:16.739> ring

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 
process as your G up comes the ring

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:18.949 
process as your G up comes the ring
finger<00:03:17.220> down<00:03:17.250> it<00:03:17.730> goes<00:03:18.000> and<00:03:18.390> off<00:03:18.480> go<00:03:18.690> the<00:03:18.810> other

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
finger down it goes and off go the other

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:20.010 
finger down it goes and off go the other
two

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:20.020 
two

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:22.170 
two
but<00:03:20.920> because<00:03:21.190> the<00:03:21.340> ring<00:03:21.580> finger<00:03:21.940> is<00:03:22.060> the

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.180 
but because the ring finger is the

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:25.890 
but because the ring finger is the
weakest<00:03:22.570> one<00:03:22.780> it<00:03:23.320> will<00:03:23.500> be<00:03:23.620> much<00:03:23.830> faster<00:03:24.900> over

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
weakest one it will be much faster over

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:27.870 
weakest one it will be much faster over
the<00:03:26.080> unit<00:03:26.290> with<00:03:26.710> practicing<00:03:27.280> it<00:03:27.400> you'll<00:03:27.550> find

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:27.880 
the unit with practicing it you'll find

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:29.880 
the unit with practicing it you'll find
that<00:03:28.030> these<00:03:28.420> two<00:03:28.480> fingers<00:03:28.960> are<00:03:29.320> faster<00:03:29.860> and

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:29.890 
that these two fingers are faster and

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:32.670 
that these two fingers are faster and
reacting<00:03:30.580> to<00:03:30.610> where<00:03:31.330> they<00:03:31.450> need<00:03:31.660> to<00:03:31.690> go<00:03:31.990> that

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:32.680 
reacting to where they need to go that

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:35.040 
reacting to where they need to go that
the<00:03:32.800> ring<00:03:33.040> finger<00:03:33.490> is<00:03:33.640> if<00:03:33.880> you<00:03:34.000> go<00:03:34.210> starting

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:35.050 
the ring finger is if you go starting

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:38.150 
the ring finger is if you go starting
from<00:03:35.170> the<00:03:35.290> index<00:03:35.620> finger<00:03:36.040> do<00:03:36.280> I<00:03:36.340> make<00:03:36.520> sense<00:03:37.020> so

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
from the index finger do I make sense so

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:44.390 
from the index finger do I make sense so
ring<00:03:39.160> finger<00:03:39.520> up<00:03:39.730> down<00:03:40.420> come<00:03:40.660> the<00:03:40.780> other<00:03:40.900> two

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.070 

so<00:03:45.400> that's<00:03:45.910> a<00:03:46.060> good<00:03:46.240> tip<00:03:46.420> for<00:03:46.450> any<00:03:46.750> chord

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:47.080 
so that's a good tip for any chord

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:49.530 
so that's a good tip for any chord
change<00:03:47.290> I'm<00:03:47.440> using<00:03:47.590> G<00:03:47.890> to<00:03:48.070> C<00:03:48.340> but<00:03:48.670> whatever

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:49.540 
change I'm using G to C but whatever

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:53.000 
change I'm using G to C but whatever
finger<00:03:49.840> you<00:03:50.050> instinctively<00:03:50.620> put<00:03:51.070> down<00:03:51.310> first

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
finger you instinctively put down first

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:55.200 
finger you instinctively put down first
reverse<00:03:54.010> the<00:03:54.220> order<00:03:54.460> so<00:03:54.640> whichever<00:03:54.850> one<00:03:55.060> goes

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:55.210 
reverse the order so whichever one goes

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:57.210 
reverse the order so whichever one goes
down<00:03:55.270> last<00:03:55.780> make<00:03:56.200> that<00:03:56.410> the<00:03:56.590> first<00:03:56.860> finger

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:57.220 
down last make that the first finger

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:59.850 
down last make that the first finger
that<00:03:57.370> goes<00:03:57.520> down<00:03:57.840> and<00:03:58.840> then<00:03:58.990> gradually<00:03:59.500> as<00:03:59.680> you

00:03:59.850 --> 00:03:59.860 
that goes down and then gradually as you

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:03.240 
that goes down and then gradually as you
begin<00:04:00.310> to<00:04:00.700> feel<00:04:01.000> the<00:04:01.500> code<00:04:02.500> changes<00:04:02.860> speeding

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:03.250 
begin to feel the code changes speeding

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:06.480 
begin to feel the code changes speeding
up<00:04:03.400> do<00:04:04.060> two<00:04:04.300> things<00:04:04.630> first<00:04:05.530> of<00:04:05.650> all<00:04:05.770> try<00:04:06.430> to

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:06.490 
up do two things first of all try to

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:08.340 
up do two things first of all try to
make<00:04:06.760> the<00:04:07.030> whole<00:04:07.240> chord<00:04:07.570> shape<00:04:07.840> in<00:04:08.020> midair

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:08.350 
make the whole chord shape in midair

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:10.050 
make the whole chord shape in midair
like<00:04:08.590> I<00:04:08.710> did<00:04:08.830> with<00:04:08.950> that<00:04:08.980> C<00:04:09.310> chord<00:04:09.520> here<00:04:09.820> is<00:04:09.940> the

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:10.060 
like I did with that C chord here is the

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:11.790 
like I did with that C chord here is the
secret<00:04:10.360> but<00:04:10.600> not<00:04:10.900> pressing<00:04:11.140> the<00:04:11.320> strings<00:04:11.590> down

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:11.800 
secret but not pressing the strings down

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:14.310 
secret but not pressing the strings down
and<00:04:11.980> I'll<00:04:12.070> drop<00:04:12.400> the<00:04:12.640> whole<00:04:12.790> shape<00:04:13.230> onto<00:04:14.230> the

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:14.320 
and I'll drop the whole shape onto the

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:16.170 
and I'll drop the whole shape onto the
strings<00:04:14.620> that<00:04:15.580> of<00:04:15.760> course<00:04:15.880> is<00:04:16.030> what

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:16.180 
strings that of course is what

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:17.760 
strings that of course is what
guitarists<00:04:16.720> are<00:04:16.810> doing<00:04:17.020> when<00:04:17.200> you<00:04:17.230> see<00:04:17.560> them

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:17.770 
guitarists are doing when you see them

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:20.250 
guitarists are doing when you see them
change<00:04:18.130> chords<00:04:18.520> with<00:04:19.180> no<00:04:19.360> perceptible<00:04:19.750> gap<00:04:20.080> at

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:20.260 
change chords with no perceptible gap at

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:23.160 
change chords with no perceptible gap at
all<00:04:20.530> chord<00:04:21.370> shapes<00:04:21.610> made<00:04:21.820> in<00:04:21.970> the<00:04:22.090> air<00:04:22.240> down<00:04:22.990> it

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:23.170 
all chord shapes made in the air down it

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:26.940 
all chord shapes made in the air down it
goes<00:04:24.120> the<00:04:25.120> other<00:04:25.270> thing<00:04:25.510> to<00:04:25.630> do<00:04:25.810> and<00:04:26.290> only<00:04:26.410> do

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:26.950 
goes the other thing to do and only do

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:29.160 
goes the other thing to do and only do
this<00:04:27.190> when<00:04:27.580> you<00:04:27.820> feel<00:04:28.270> that<00:04:28.450> you're<00:04:28.600> very<00:04:28.660> very

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:29.170 
this when you feel that you're very very

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:31.440 
this when you feel that you're very very
close<00:04:29.470> sometimes<00:04:30.400> we<00:04:30.520> get<00:04:30.640> very<00:04:31.030> close<00:04:31.210> to

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:31.450 
close sometimes we get very close to

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:36.270 
close sometimes we get very close to
quick<00:04:31.870> chord<00:04:32.110> changes<00:04:32.560> but<00:04:33.190> the<00:04:34.090> the<00:04:35.280> stopping

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:36.280 
quick chord changes but the the stopping

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:37.860 
quick chord changes but the the stopping
in<00:04:36.460> between<00:04:36.490> chord<00:04:37.090> changes<00:04:37.420> to<00:04:37.480> allow<00:04:37.690> the

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:37.870 
in between chord changes to allow the

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:39.990 
in between chord changes to allow the
change<00:04:38.140> to<00:04:38.350> happen<00:04:38.710> can<00:04:38.890> become<00:04:39.190> a<00:04:39.250> habit<00:04:39.730> so

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:40.000 
change to happen can become a habit so

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.420 
change to happen can become a habit so
that<00:04:40.900> we<00:04:40.990> automatically<00:04:41.620> stop<00:04:41.980> before<00:04:42.340> the

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:42.430 
that we automatically stop before the

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:45.270 
that we automatically stop before the
chord<00:04:42.900> when<00:04:43.900> you<00:04:44.020> get<00:04:44.170> very<00:04:44.440> close<00:04:44.800> to<00:04:44.860> quick

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:45.280 
chord when you get very close to quick

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:46.890 
chord when you get very close to quick
chord<00:04:45.550> changes<00:04:45.910> you<00:04:46.090> need<00:04:46.210> to<00:04:46.330> help<00:04:46.480> yourself

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:46.900 
chord changes you need to help yourself

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:48.660 
chord changes you need to help yourself
to<00:04:47.050> force<00:04:47.290> your<00:04:47.500> way<00:04:47.590> through<00:04:47.860> that<00:04:47.890> and<00:04:48.340> do

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:48.670 
to force your way through that and do

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:50.730 
to force your way through that and do
that<00:04:48.850> by<00:04:49.030> not<00:04:49.360> allowing<00:04:49.600> the<00:04:49.990> strum<00:04:50.290> to<00:04:50.320> break

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:50.740 
that by not allowing the strum to break

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:53.610 
that by not allowing the strum to break
do<00:04:51.370> a<00:04:51.400> very<00:04:51.850> very<00:04:52.090> simple<00:04:52.900> strum<00:04:53.170> pattern<00:04:53.530> a

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:53.620 
do a very very simple strum pattern a

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:57.260 
do a very very simple strum pattern a
slow<00:04:54.040> one<00:04:55.380> do

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:57.270 
slow one do

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:00.980 
slow one do
three<00:04:58.190> four<00:04:59.190> we're<00:04:59.460> gonna<00:04:59.610> see<00:04:59.970> but<00:05:00.450> we<00:05:00.660> won't

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:00.990 
three four we're gonna see but we won't

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:05.750 
three four we're gonna see but we won't
let<00:05:01.380> the<00:05:01.620> rhythm<00:05:02.240> change<00:05:03.240> I<00:05:04.250> won't<00:05:05.250> allow<00:05:05.730> that

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:05.760 
let the rhythm change I won't allow that

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:08.150 
let the rhythm change I won't allow that
rhythm<00:05:06.240> to<00:05:06.450> stop<00:05:06.720> even<00:05:07.290> if<00:05:07.410> the<00:05:07.560> left<00:05:07.920> hand

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:08.160

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:11.680 
rhythm to stop even if the left hand
cord<00:05:08.400> is<00:05:08.460> having<00:05:08.730> to<00:05:08.850> catch<00:05:09.090> up<00:05:09.360> a<00:05:09.480> little<00:05:09.510> bit

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:11.690 
cord is having to catch up a little bit

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:16.490 
cord is having to catch up a little bit
yeah<00:05:14.060> that's<00:05:15.060> only<00:05:15.270> necessary<00:05:15.570> if<00:05:15.990> you<00:05:16.170> find

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:16.500 
yeah that's only necessary if you find

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:18.710 
yeah that's only necessary if you find
that<00:05:16.620> stopping<00:05:17.250> to<00:05:17.550> change<00:05:17.820> chord<00:05:18.210> with<00:05:18.570> your

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:18.720 
that stopping to change chord with your

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:20.780 
that stopping to change chord with your
strumming<00:05:18.990> hand<00:05:19.140> has<00:05:19.440> become<00:05:19.560> a<00:05:19.770> habit<00:05:20.070> which

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:20.790 
strumming hand has become a habit which

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:24.200 
strumming hand has become a habit which
which<00:05:21.090> can<00:05:21.330> happen<00:05:22.490> all<00:05:23.490> right<00:05:24.000> I'm<00:05:24.180> sure

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:24.210 
which can happen all right I'm sure

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:25.430 
which can happen all right I'm sure
we'll<00:05:24.510> have<00:05:24.600> more<00:05:24.660> to<00:05:24.990> say<00:05:25.020> on<00:05:25.170> that<00:05:25.380> subject

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:25.440 
we'll have more to say on that subject

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:28.430 
we'll have more to say on that subject
