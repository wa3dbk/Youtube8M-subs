00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:06.790
 the ministry of agriculture presents 

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:09.580
 asparagus production 

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:11.620
 the valleys of freedom and ica are the 

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:13.930
 regions that have the highest percentage 

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:16.540
 of production of asparagus in Peru 

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:19.210
 thanks to the favorable conditions of 

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:21.520
 nature technology and greater 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:23.890
 business capacity what has 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:28.080
 allowed the country to be the main 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:30.750
 asparagus exporter worldwide 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.640
 to date the harvested area of 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.960
 asparagus exceeded 33 thousand hectares 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:40.020
 with an average yield of 11 thousand 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:43.410
 844 kilograms per hectare in that 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.120
 sense the asparagus would represent the 22 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.760
 percent of the gross value of the 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.670
 agricultural production and constitutes the 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:54.640
 72 percent of the total value of the 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:57.550
 agricultural exports of Peru 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:59.260
 for these positive indicators are each 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:02.010
 more and more farmers and producers 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:04.780
 of ica who opt for associativity 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:07.330
 to undertake new challenges with the 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:10.150
 asparagus cultivation 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:12.520
 this is the case of the producer network 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:15.670
 of fruits and vegetables santa domingi 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:19.119
 is in the psuv boy of our country 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:22.750
 was created on April 30, 2009 and 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:25.180
 currently has 44 members for the 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:28.330
 benefits they get and the success of the 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:31.540
 association are to be incorporated 40 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:33.580
 more partners this year don gerardo 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:35.340
 Gutierrez president of the network of 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:38.289
 fruit and vegetable producers 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:41.110
 ensures that the success of the network lies in 

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:43.600
 recognize the need for associativity 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:46.149
 in the agrarian sector that already come 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:48.369
 benefiting hundreds of families of 

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:50.649
 producers directly and 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:54.490
 indirectly the work of the producers 

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:57.429
 five years ago, each one was divided 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:02:01.090
 each one individually 

00:01:57.429 --> 00:02:05.080
 he was looking for his same price and there for his 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:06.970
 product quality or maybe for a 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:08.350
 better investment had a product of 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:10.720
 quality and obtained better price than 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:12.340
 I could not do it I was suffering the 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.799
 channel of being able to be topped by the 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:17.080
 financial entities is where it was born 

00:02:14.799 --> 00:02:19.780
 this organization to try to follow 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:23.290
 united and be able to help us because today in 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:24.640
 day our producer network knows 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:26.160
 solve the problems to the 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:29.410
 producers who have economic chaos 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:31.660
 don sabino huamán manager of the network of 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:33.970
 producers is proud that the 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:37.209
 product that they grow is already 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:39.130
 considered a flagship product and despite 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:41.620
 that are not yet consumed by the 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:44.440
 Peruvians trust that their consumption per 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:48.340
 capita is increased because it is a 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:50.500
 source rich in proteins and vitamins don 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:52.630
 sabino remembers that years ago some 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:54.760
 members were engaged in the cultivation of 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:57.519
 cotton but because of the high yields 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:00.370
 asparagus chose to change 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:02.940
 culture instead now how do we have the 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:06.270
 network is this 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:08.670
 you have that the price is improved 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:11.550
 because there is competition there is no 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:13.500
 good competition here and we have no 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:15.690
 a little more money that is earned and 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:18.030
 Well, to educate you then 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:20.610
 the asparagus production of the 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:22.860
 Association varies according to work and 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:26.700
 Farmer's investment to greater 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:30.150
 Higher investment production in this valley 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:34.200
 compared to vine and pecan cotton 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:36.570
 to the asparagus gives more profitability 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:39.420
 most of its fields have 

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:41.610
 technified pressurized irrigation and some 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:43.980
 with irrigation to gravity 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:45.930
 this technology application is 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:48.750
 necessary considering that the 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:51.570
 modern competitive agriculture and with 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:54.360
 Export demand uses systems 

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:57.300
 irrigation systems that allow a 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:04:00.220
 greater production and productivity with a 

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:02.620
 efficient use of water 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:05.110
 with one year of experience in the market 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:07.180
 exporter the producers of the network of 

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:09.700
 fruit and vegetable producers of 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:13.030
 ica coincide that for the project 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:15.790
 be sustainable the key to success is the 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:17.260
 associativity and entrepreneurship 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:19.750
 for this last year the fish have 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:21.609
 improved if they were not 70 before 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:23.040
 cents per kilogram are 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:25.140
 paying 

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:27.130
 at the time of these two dollars 10 

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:31.169
 to say an example 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:33.449
 and so the price has increased 

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:36.569
 deficient images of sold 70 a 

00:04:33.449 --> 00:04:39.300
 kilo two dollars if the production is in 

00:04:36.569 --> 00:04:41.610
 average of 8 thousand kilos connect in the 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:44.729
 association after harvesting their 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:47.249
 asparagus select them hydrate them and 

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:49.860
 weighs it distributes its product to the 

00:04:47.249 --> 00:04:52.229
 agro-export companies who 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:53.710
 process the asparagus in the plant and 

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:56.920
 export 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:58.690
 With great satisfaction don sabino huamán 

00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:01.300
 account that this culture of asparagus 

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:04.750
 it has allowed them to improve their income 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:07.720
 economic and quality of life not only 

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:10.560
 associated farmers but to the 

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:13.500
 community in general 

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:16.380
 he remembers that before the district did not 

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:19.860
 had basic services but now 

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:22.889
 thanks to this crop they have improved and 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:25.919
 the new generations already have access to 

00:05:22.889 --> 00:05:28.470
 quality education before previously 

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:30.810
 we could not I'm 10 tails then 

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:32.550
 we study say with our 

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:33.570
 notebooks nothing more in exchange to see 

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:36.030
 they have everything 

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:37.950
 he has years they go to school and return to 

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:40.470
 home have a joint computer 

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:43.500
 willingness to do their homework everything 

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:46.170
 in this way the asparagus is that 

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:49.530
 product with greater success both in its 

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:52.380
 cool way bound for the usa and 

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:55.650
 in its frozen form and preserved in 

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:58.470
 580 gram bottles exported to the 

00:05:55.650 --> 00:06:01.409
 countries of the European Union highlighting 

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:04.050
 Spain and France 

00:06:01.409 --> 00:06:05.789
 undoubtedly the permanent concern of 

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:08.219
 the network of fruit producers and 

00:06:05.789 --> 00:06:09.929
 vegetables for improving the application of 

00:06:08.219 --> 00:06:12.839
 technology in their crops 

00:06:09.929 --> 00:06:15.539
 asparagus and in its packaging center 

00:06:12.839 --> 00:06:17.759
 will allow to be more competitive and be a 

00:06:15.539 --> 00:06:23.059
 leading company in the agricultural sector
