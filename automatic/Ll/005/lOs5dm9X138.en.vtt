00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:07.080
 Hi Daniel, I'm kalai and I'm from Brazil. 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:26.480
 I'll talk about why I eat food. 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:29.429
 raw and uncooked good neither food 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:31.410
 cooked it can be so good for your 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.420
 body as the raw food 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.640
 based on the assumption that the food 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.620
 is alive that the food that is 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.870
 full of water when the 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.500
 cooking this food he eventually 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.469
 die 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:46.440
 their enzymes are dead are their 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:49.140
 sugars are caramelized their 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.149
 Protein structures are broken so 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.610
 who feeds on a cooked food 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:56.430
 predominantly cooked with certainty that 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:59.100
 has an amino acid deficiency 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.410
 not to mention the taste issue if the 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.589
 food needs to be cooked so that it 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.840
 has a nice good taste to your 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.010
 that food does not serve to 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.090
 the human beings 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:14.040
 no cooked food is as good as 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:17.520
 the raw food all foods 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:20.280
 to inhibit your healing. 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.450
 because he will tamper with the immunity of the 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.180
 your body 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.939
 Why do you think you should make a 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.470
 fasting blood test why why 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.840
 in modern society when people 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:34.290
 Let 's face it, we have a 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:36.720
 increased production of leukocytes in that 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:40.350
 at which time the human organism 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:43.649
 see the food cooked as an invader as 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:46.470
 a self-poisoning why 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:49.170
 at that moment he begins to tinker with 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:53.040
 their immunity and increase their production 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:55.229
 of leukocytes is the raw food that 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:58.799
 contains much more water containing 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:01.380
 fibers is that it contains its enzymes 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:03.659
 it is a very passable food 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.789
 different from a cooked food 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:09.030
 which is already in a process of 

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:11.700
 constant rotting of proliferation 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:14.519
 of pathological bacteria that your 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:17.489
 body will look for that food 

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:20.340
 as an attacker and you will not be able to 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:23.790
 digest in a normal way 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:26.540
 then cooked food is like a cola 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:31.170
 inside your intestines 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:34.830
 so they try they rot 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:38.160
 very quickly and everyone 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:41.220
 there you go astray through books 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:42.750
 instructs scriptures and has beliefs and 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:45.170
 more belief that I meant to 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:49.560
 you who go in the gospel of the Essenes 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:52.110
 is who in a quote from Jesus in which 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:56.129
 I would say no with not cooking your food 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:58.890
 with the fire of death am then if you 

00:02:56.129 --> 00:03:00.299
 cook your food you 're going to kill 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:02.790
 your food 

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:06.150
 food will be able to lose power 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:09.750
 regeneration the power of cleaning the power 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:13.170
 of detoxification that exists when he 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:15.510
 is consumed in a natural way 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:18.720
 this is our short message today 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:21.239
 It's just more to qualify a little. 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:23.069
 this story of the raw and the stew if you 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:26.579
 liked the video share with your 

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:28.799
 friends behave with people there 

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:31.799
 do you think can benefit 

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:34.200
 With that remember raw food is a 

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:36.030
 live food is a cleaning food 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:38.519
 cooked food already died 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:40.889
 do the test place a raw carrot and 

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:43.440
 a stew on the table 

00:03:40.889 --> 00:03:47.090
 wait to see how long they last and one 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:47.090
 How long will another one last?
