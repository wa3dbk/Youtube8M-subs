00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
I was in the film and I didn't really

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.209 
I was in the film and I didn't really
have<00:00:38.820> an<00:00:39.059> assignment<00:00:39.809> my<00:00:40.559> assignment<00:00:41.070> was

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
have an assignment my assignment was

whatever<00:00:41.399> I<00:00:41.610> want<00:00:41.879> it<00:00:42.000> to<00:00:42.120> be<00:00:42.300> so<00:00:42.540> I<00:00:42.570> had<00:00:42.750> just

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
whatever I want it to be so I had just

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.709 
whatever I want it to be so I had just
for<00:00:43.410> six<00:00:43.620> months<00:00:43.950> I<00:00:44.040> documented<00:00:44.760> things<00:00:44.969> that

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
for six months I documented things that

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.229 
for six months I documented things that
I<00:00:45.750> thought<00:00:46.440> were<00:00:46.649> interesting<00:00:47.190> along<00:00:47.969> the<00:00:48.149> way

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
I thought were interesting along the way

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.720 
I thought were interesting along the way
so<00:00:48.300> there's<00:00:48.870> so<00:00:49.710> many<00:00:49.800> characters<00:00:50.160> and<00:00:50.460> people

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
so there's so many characters and people

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.729 
so there's so many characters and people
in<00:00:50.820> places<00:00:51.239> that<00:00:51.480> I<00:00:51.719> just<00:00:52.050> had<00:00:52.140> a<00:00:52.170> blast<00:00:52.440> with

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
in places that I just had a blast with

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.920 
in places that I just had a blast with
it<00:00:52.770> and<00:00:53.070> it<00:00:53.670> was<00:00:53.820> great<00:00:53.969> not<00:00:54.329> having<00:00:54.390> the

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
it and it was great not having the

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.660 
it and it was great not having the
pressure<00:00:55.199> to<00:00:55.559> shoot<00:00:55.800> sometimes<00:00:56.309> I<00:00:56.399> wouldn't

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
pressure to shoot sometimes I wouldn't

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.180 
pressure to shoot sometimes I wouldn't
pick<00:00:56.789> up<00:00:56.910> the<00:00:57.030> camera<00:00:57.210> for<00:00:57.570> weeks<00:00:58.079> and<00:00:58.530> then

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
pick up the camera for weeks and then

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.119 
pick up the camera for weeks and then
sometimes<00:00:59.670> I<00:00:59.820> would<00:01:00.030> just<00:01:00.899> shoot<00:01:01.199> for<00:01:01.620> days<00:01:01.980> on

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
sometimes I would just shoot for days on

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.090 
sometimes I would just shoot for days on
end<00:01:02.190> and<00:01:02.609> so<00:01:02.940> it<00:01:03.000> was<00:01:03.090> really<00:01:03.300> nice<00:01:03.830> it's<00:01:04.830> kind

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:24.920 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.700 

that<00:01:25.909> whole<00:01:26.210> project<00:01:26.689> we<00:01:27.080> did<00:01:27.229> with<00:01:27.380> the<00:01:27.470> book

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:27.710 
that whole project we did with the book

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:29.350 
that whole project we did with the book
and<00:01:28.009> the<00:01:28.070> film<00:01:28.430> and<00:01:28.759> the<00:01:28.820> six<00:01:29.030> months<00:01:29.090> of

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:29.360 
and the film and the six months of

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.840 
and the film and the six months of
travel<00:01:29.720> that<00:01:29.900> the<00:01:30.560> voiceovers<00:01:31.189> afterwards

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:31.850 
travel that the voiceovers afterwards

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:33.249 
travel that the voiceovers afterwards
were<00:01:32.090> the<00:01:32.210> hardest<00:01:32.570> part<00:01:32.780> of<00:01:32.900> the<00:01:32.990> whole<00:01:33.229> thing

00:01:33.249 --> 00:01:33.259 
were the hardest part of the whole thing

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:35.410 
were the hardest part of the whole thing
my<00:01:33.950> first<00:01:34.250> round<00:01:34.580> of<00:01:34.759> voiceovers<00:01:35.270> were

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:35.420 
my first round of voiceovers were

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:37.570 
my first round of voiceovers were
horrible<00:01:35.930> we<00:01:36.229> did<00:01:36.409> months<00:01:36.920> and<00:01:37.130> months<00:01:37.250> I

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:37.580 
horrible we did months and months I

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:40.450 
horrible we did months and months I
think<00:01:37.909> probably<00:01:38.229> four<00:01:39.229> months<00:01:39.649> of<00:01:39.799> voiceovers

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 
think probably four months of voiceovers

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.149 
think probably four months of voiceovers
it<00:01:40.940> was<00:01:41.119> um<00:01:41.390> a<00:01:41.659> lot<00:01:42.409> of<00:01:42.440> going<00:01:42.740> back<00:01:42.860> and
