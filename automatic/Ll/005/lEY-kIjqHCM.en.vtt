separate this piece and they kind of it
there's<00:01:15.330> enough<00:01:16.009> space<00:01:17.009> to<00:01:18.320> for<00:01:19.320> a<00:01:19.350> test

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:19.970 
there's enough space to for a test

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:22.969 
there's enough space to for a test
connect<00:01:20.970> here<00:01:21.930> without<00:01:22.170> falling<00:01:22.680> off<00:01:22.770> when

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
connect here without falling off when

a generalization of his face and I can't

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:23.510 
a generalization of his face and I can't
get<00:02:22.030> it<00:02:22.120> with<00:02:22.239> stand-up<00:02:22.660> shape<00:02:22.930> that<00:02:23.140> we<00:02:23.170> go

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
get it with stand-up shape that we go

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:28.140 
get it with stand-up shape that we go
and<00:02:24.520> he<00:02:24.670> stands<00:02:25.120> up<00:02:25.209> by<00:02:25.390> himself<00:02:26.910> unlike<00:02:27.910> my

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
and he stands up by himself unlike my

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.020 
and he stands up by himself unlike my
lego<00:02:28.420> sideswipe<00:02:29.140> his<00:02:29.620> arms<00:02:30.130> do<00:02:30.310> not<00:02:30.430> move<00:02:30.670> in
