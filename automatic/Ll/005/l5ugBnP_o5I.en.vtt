your amp with your feet

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.460 
your amp with your feet
it's<00:00:36.370> just<00:00:36.640> simple<00:00:36.880> physics<00:00:37.239> so<00:00:38.230> in<00:00:38.380> this

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:38.470 
it's just simple physics so in this

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:39.840 
it's just simple physics so in this
video<00:00:38.650> we're<00:00:39.100> going<00:00:39.220> to<00:00:39.280> be<00:00:39.400> talking<00:00:39.640> about

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:39.850 
video we're going to be talking about

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:42.660 
video we're going to be talking about
how<00:00:40.210> to<00:00:40.239> use<00:00:40.540> the<00:00:40.750> eleven<00:00:41.050> rack<00:00:41.260> and<00:00:41.670> connected

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:42.670 
how to use the eleven rack and connected

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:44.910 
how to use the eleven rack and connected
foot<00:00:42.879> controllers<00:00:43.390> in<00:00:43.600> a<00:00:43.660> live<00:00:43.870> situation<00:00:44.170> the

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:44.920 
foot controllers in a live situation the

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.310 
foot controllers in a live situation the
eleven<00:00:45.220> rack<00:00:45.370> is<00:00:45.700> able<00:00:46.450> to<00:00:46.510> be<00:00:46.600> controlled<00:00:47.020> via

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:47.320 
eleven rack is able to be controlled via

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.400 
eleven rack is able to be controlled via
both<00:00:47.559> MIDI<00:00:47.890> and<00:00:48.160> also<00:00:49.059> anything<00:00:49.809> plugged<00:00:50.230> into

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:50.410 
both MIDI and also anything plugged into

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:51.450 
both MIDI and also anything plugged into
its<00:00:50.680> footswitch<00:00:51.129> jack

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:51.460 
its footswitch jack

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:53.810 
its footswitch jack
so<00:00:52.239> the<00:00:52.360> footswitch<00:00:52.660> jack<00:00:52.720> on<00:00:53.050> the<00:00:53.110> back<00:00:53.290> panel

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
so the footswitch jack on the back panel

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.220 
so the footswitch jack on the back panel
basically<00:00:54.820> has<00:00:54.940> two<00:00:55.090> functions<00:00:55.270> first<00:00:56.050> thing

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:56.230 
basically has two functions first thing

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:58.620 
basically has two functions first thing
you<00:00:56.320> can<00:00:56.410> do<00:00:56.530> is<00:00:56.710> connect<00:00:57.070> to<00:00:57.790> momentary<00:00:58.390> foot

00:00:58.620 --> 00:00:58.630 
you can do is connect to momentary foot

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:00.750 
you can do is connect to momentary foot
switches<00:00:58.930> to<00:00:59.050> it<00:00:59.170> and<00:00:59.350> then<00:01:00.220> set<00:01:00.489> them<00:01:00.610> to

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:00.760 
switches to it and then set them to

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.829 
switches to it and then set them to
things<00:01:01.000> like<00:01:01.320> about<00:01:02.320> tuner<00:01:02.710> on<00:01:02.829> and<00:01:02.980> off<00:01:03.839> tap

00:01:04.829 --> 00:01:04.839 
things like about tuner on and off tap

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:08.190 
things like about tuner on and off tap
tempo<00:01:05.080> delay<00:01:05.560> or<00:01:05.890> patch<00:01:06.550> changes<00:01:06.970> or<00:01:07.930> you<00:01:08.170> can

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:08.200 
tempo delay or patch changes or you can

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.510 
tempo delay or patch changes or you can
do<00:01:08.440> what<00:01:08.619> we're<00:01:08.710> going<00:01:08.830> to<00:01:08.860> be<00:01:08.950> doing<00:01:09.130> here

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:09.520 
do what we're going to be doing here

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:11.490 
do what we're going to be doing here
which<00:01:09.790> is<00:01:09.940> connecting<00:01:10.390> a<00:01:10.509> continuous<00:01:11.080> control

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:11.500 
which is connecting a continuous control

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.560 
which is connecting a continuous control
pedal<00:01:11.860> and<00:01:12.040> setting<00:01:12.820> it<00:01:12.910> to<00:01:12.940> do<00:01:13.090> things<00:01:13.360> like

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:13.570 
pedal and setting it to do things like

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:17.490 
pedal and setting it to do things like
rig<00:01:14.110> or<00:01:14.380> volume<00:01:15.070> or<00:01:15.250> wah<00:01:15.630> so<00:01:16.630> let's<00:01:17.229> look<00:01:17.350> at

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:17.500 
rig or volume or wah so let's look at

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:22.710 
rig or volume or wah so let's look at
how<00:01:17.590> you<00:01:17.619> do<00:01:18.040> that<00:01:18.280> on<00:01:18.460> the<00:01:18.640> eleven<00:01:18.940> rack<00:01:21.720> ok

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:22.720 
how you do that on the eleven rack ok

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:24.300 
how you do that on the eleven rack ok
now<00:01:22.930> we're<00:01:23.110> looking<00:01:23.170> at<00:01:23.350> the<00:01:23.440> front<00:01:23.740> panel<00:01:23.979> of

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:24.310 
now we're looking at the front panel of

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:25.830 
now we're looking at the front panel of
the<00:01:24.369> 11<00:01:24.700> rack<00:01:24.850> and<00:01:25.180> if<00:01:25.420> you<00:01:25.509> want<00:01:25.660> to<00:01:25.720> look

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:25.840 
the 11 rack and if you want to look

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.170 
the 11 rack and if you want to look
inside<00:01:25.990> and<00:01:26.649> look<00:01:27.040> at<00:01:27.160> the<00:01:27.250> architecture<00:01:27.729> to

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:28.180 
inside and look at the architecture to

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:30.270 
inside and look at the architecture to
see<00:01:28.360> what<00:01:28.990> pedals<00:01:29.380> are<00:01:29.500> loaded<00:01:29.770> what<00:01:29.920> amps<00:01:30.160> are

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:30.280 
see what pedals are loaded what amps are

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:32.370 
see what pedals are loaded what amps are
loaded<00:01:30.490> you<00:01:30.520> just<00:01:30.729> hit<00:01:30.880> this<00:01:30.970> button<00:01:31.179> and<00:01:31.479> now

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:32.380 
loaded you just hit this button and now

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:33.900 
loaded you just hit this button and now
you're<00:01:32.560> looking<00:01:32.649> at<00:01:32.920> the<00:01:33.130> entire<00:01:33.280> signal

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:33.910 
you're looking at the entire signal

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:35.820 
you're looking at the entire signal
chain<00:01:34.060> much<00:01:34.270> like<00:01:34.420> a<00:01:34.450> pedal<00:01:34.720> board<00:01:34.869> and<00:01:35.050> the

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:35.830 
chain much like a pedal board and the

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:38.540 
chain much like a pedal board and the
pedal<00:01:36.190> control<00:01:36.729> is<00:01:36.970> over<00:01:37.270> on<00:01:37.450> the<00:01:37.810> far<00:01:38.050> right

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:38.550 
pedal control is over on the far right

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:40.800 
pedal control is over on the far right
when<00:01:39.550> it's<00:01:39.729> connected<00:01:39.970> to<00:01:40.179> the<00:01:40.330> jack<00:01:40.539> on<00:01:40.720> the

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:40.810 
when it's connected to the jack on the

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:43.109 
when it's connected to the jack on the
back<00:01:41.020> so<00:01:41.380> any<00:01:41.770> continuous<00:01:42.520> control<00:01:42.819> pedal

00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:43.119 
back so any continuous control pedal

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:44.910 
back so any continuous control pedal
plugged<00:01:43.720> into<00:01:43.899> the<00:01:44.050> jack<00:01:44.259> on<00:01:44.410> the<00:01:44.440> back<00:01:44.649> and

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:44.920 
plugged into the jack on the back and

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.219 
plugged into the jack on the back and
basically<00:01:45.399> do<00:01:45.490> one<00:01:45.789> of<00:01:45.910> four<00:01:46.149> things<00:01:46.420> it<00:01:47.080> can

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:47.229 
basically do one of four things it can

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:49.919 
basically do one of four things it can
be<00:01:47.259> volume<00:01:47.920> pedal<00:01:48.220> as<00:01:48.429> it<00:01:48.550> is<00:01:48.640> right<00:01:48.789> now<00:01:48.929> it

00:01:49.919 --> 00:01:49.929 
be volume pedal as it is right now it

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:55.100 
be volume pedal as it is right now it
can<00:01:50.110> be<00:01:50.380> rigged<00:01:51.190> all<00:01:51.369> Youm<00:01:51.580> it<00:01:52.569> can<00:01:52.750> be<00:01:52.929> wah<00:01:53.380> or

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
can be rigged all Youm it can be wah or

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.210 
can be rigged all Youm it can be wah or
multi<00:01:56.110> effects<00:01:56.380> now<00:01:56.560> multi<00:01:56.860> effects<00:01:57.069> is

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:57.220 
multi effects now multi effects is

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:59.400 
multi effects now multi effects is
something<00:01:57.459> kind<00:01:57.580> of<00:01:57.670> cool<00:01:57.880> it<00:01:58.750> allows<00:01:59.020> you<00:01:59.200> to

00:01:59.400 --> 00:01:59.410 
something kind of cool it allows you to

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:01.859 
something kind of cool it allows you to
chain<00:01:59.800> up<00:02:00.039> to<00:02:00.459> four<00:02:00.849> different<00:02:01.030> parameters<00:02:01.630> to

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:01.869 
chain up to four different parameters to

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:05.040 
chain up to four different parameters to
the<00:02:02.319> pedal<00:02:02.649> at<00:02:02.800> once<00:02:03.069> which<00:02:03.940> means<00:02:04.270> you<00:02:04.929> could

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:05.050 
the pedal at once which means you could

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:06.749 
the pedal at once which means you could
do<00:02:05.140> something<00:02:05.380> like<00:02:05.500> having<00:02:06.220> the<00:02:06.399> reverb

00:02:06.749 --> 00:02:06.759 
do something like having the reverb

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:09.240 
do something like having the reverb
level<00:02:07.090> and<00:02:07.240> the<00:02:07.810> distortion<00:02:08.349> level<00:02:08.619> tied<00:02:09.099> to

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 
level and the distortion level tied to

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:11.339 
level and the distortion level tied to
the<00:02:09.340> pedal<00:02:09.550> at<00:02:09.640> the<00:02:09.700> same<00:02:09.880> time<00:02:10.179> so<00:02:10.780> when<00:02:11.230> you

00:02:11.339 --> 00:02:11.349 
the pedal at the same time so when you

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:13.230 
the pedal at the same time so when you
turn<00:02:11.860> up<00:02:12.010> the<00:02:12.040> distortion<00:02:12.580> it<00:02:12.760> would<00:02:12.910> turn

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:09.890 
recording so if you have a MIDI track
open<00:04:08.850> and<00:04:08.970> it's<00:04:09.090> recording<00:04:09.540> it<00:04:09.690> might

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 
open and it's recording it might

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.140 
open and it's recording it might
actually<00:04:10.110> record<00:04:10.890> the<00:04:11.190> continuous<00:04:11.820> control

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
actually record the continuous control

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:13.430 
actually record the continuous control
data<00:04:12.360> you're<00:04:12.570> doing<00:04:12.810> here<00:04:13.019> and<00:04:13.110> you<00:04:13.170> might<00:04:13.290> not

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:13.440 
data you're doing here and you might not

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:15.140 
data you're doing here and you might not
like<00:04:13.500> that<00:04:13.950> so<00:04:14.190> you<00:04:14.280> can<00:04:14.430> certainly<00:04:14.579> turn<00:04:14.970> off

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.150 
like that so you can certainly turn off

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:17.810 
like that so you can certainly turn off
the<00:04:15.480> CC<00:04:15.810> button<00:04:16.019> there<00:04:16.260> and<00:04:16.669> down<00:04:17.669> on<00:04:17.760> the

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:17.820 
the CC button there and down on the

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:19.219 
the CC button there and down on the
bottom<00:04:17.970> probably<00:04:18.390> the<00:04:18.450> most<00:04:18.540> important<00:04:19.079> is

00:04:19.219 --> 00:04:19.229 
bottom probably the most important is

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:21.920 
bottom probably the most important is
the<00:04:19.500> channel<00:04:19.979> so<00:04:20.729> I'm<00:04:20.850> going<00:04:21.000> to<00:04:21.060> set<00:04:21.239> it<00:04:21.359> to<00:04:21.540> be

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:21.930 
the channel so I'm going to set it to be

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:24.950 
the channel so I'm going to set it to be
Omni<00:04:22.620> basically<00:04:23.190> listen<00:04:24.120> to<00:04:24.210> everything<00:04:24.479> MIDI

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:24.960 
Omni basically listen to everything MIDI

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:26.570 
Omni basically listen to everything MIDI

please that's what I'm basically asking
it<00:04:27.950> pop<00:04:28.950> it<00:04:29.070> back<00:04:29.100> out<00:04:29.370> of<00:04:29.400> here<00:04:29.760> and<00:04:30.570> now<00:04:30.780> I

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:31.160 
it pop it back out of here and now I

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:33.770 
it pop it back out of here and now I
have<00:04:32.160> a<00:04:32.430> patch<00:04:32.640> here<00:04:32.940> on<00:04:33.030> the<00:04:33.120> floor<00:04:33.360> on<00:04:33.720> my

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:33.780 
have a patch here on the floor on my

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:35.510 
have a patch here on the floor on my
MIDI<00:04:34.229> controller<00:04:34.590> that<00:04:34.860> is<00:04:34.919> going<00:04:35.190> to<00:04:35.310> send

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:35.520 
MIDI controller that is going to send

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:38.090 
MIDI controller that is going to send
not<00:04:35.790> only<00:04:36.150> a<00:04:36.180> patch<00:04:36.540> change<00:04:36.960> but<00:04:37.710> also<00:04:38.070> a

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:38.100 
not only a patch change but also a

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:39.620 
not only a patch change but also a
continuous<00:04:38.700> control<00:04:39.000> change<00:04:39.240> at<00:04:39.390> the<00:04:39.479> same

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:39.630 
continuous control change at the same

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:42.020 
continuous control change at the same
time<00:04:39.900> so<00:04:40.650> when<00:04:40.860> I<00:04:40.890> switch<00:04:41.550> to<00:04:41.669> this<00:04:41.820> patch

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:42.030 
time so when I switch to this patch

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:43.130 
time so when I switch to this patch
you're<00:04:42.270> going<00:04:42.390> to<00:04:42.450> see<00:04:42.600> that<00:04:42.750> it<00:04:42.870> will<00:04:42.930> also

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:43.140 
you're going to see that it will also

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:46.310 
you're going to see that it will also
turn<00:04:43.890> off<00:04:43.950> the<00:04:44.220> effects<00:04:44.520> loop<00:04:44.700> so<00:04:45.419> is<00:04:45.630> here<00:04:46.260> we

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:46.320 
turn off the effects loop so is here we

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:46.610 
turn off the effects loop so is here we
go

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:46.620 
go

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:49.120 
go
blink

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:49.130 
blink

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:51.100 
blink
let's<00:04:50.090> turn<00:04:50.180> off<00:04:50.330> the<00:04:50.420> effects<00:04:50.660> loop<00:04:50.840> we<00:04:51.080> have

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:51.110 
let's turn off the effects loop we have

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:57.820 
let's turn off the effects loop we have
a<00:04:51.230> completely<00:04:51.620> different<00:04:51.710> sound<00:04:52.040> now<00:04:56.200> so<00:04:57.200> when

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:57.830 
a completely different sound now so when

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:59.470 
a completely different sound now so when
I<00:04:57.860> go<00:04:58.040> into<00:04:58.220> continuous<00:04:58.760> controller<00:04:59.180> mode

00:04:59.470 --> 00:04:59.480 
I go into continuous controller mode

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:01.330 
I go into continuous controller mode
I've<00:04:59.900> got<00:05:00.170> it<00:05:00.290> set<00:05:00.470> up<00:05:00.500> so<00:05:00.830> I<00:05:00.860> have<00:05:01.130> the<00:05:01.250> ability

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:01.340 
I've got it set up so I have the ability

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:04.120 
I've got it set up so I have the ability
to<00:05:01.640> turn<00:05:01.880> off<00:05:02.120> and<00:05:02.420> on<00:05:02.810> all<00:05:03.260> of<00:05:03.470> the<00:05:03.560> individual

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:04.130 
to turn off and on all of the individual

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:06.640 
to turn off and on all of the individual
patches<00:05:04.520> or<00:05:04.850> presets<00:05:05.300> were<00:05:05.480> or<00:05:06.080> effects

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:06.650 
patches or presets were or effects

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:09.460 
patches or presets were or effects
inside<00:05:07.130> of<00:05:07.430> the<00:05:07.580> patch<00:05:07.820> so<00:05:08.510> I<00:05:08.540> can<00:05:08.990> turn<00:05:09.170> on<00:05:09.230> and

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:09.470 
inside of the patch so I can turn on and

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:16.900 
inside of the patch so I can turn on and
off<00:05:09.560> the<00:05:09.920> delay<00:05:14.290> off<00:05:15.290> I<00:05:15.890> can<00:05:16.160> turn<00:05:16.340> on<00:05:16.520> the

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:16.910 
off the delay off I can turn on the

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:24.190 
off the delay off I can turn on the
modulation<00:05:21.340> I<00:05:22.340> can<00:05:23.240> turn<00:05:23.420> off<00:05:23.540> and<00:05:23.780> on<00:05:23.990> the

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:24.200 
modulation I can turn off and on the

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:30.330 
modulation I can turn off and on the
fuzz

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:30.340 

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:32.950 

the<00:05:31.340> thing<00:05:31.610> to<00:05:31.730> get<00:05:31.940> about<00:05:32.330> this<00:05:32.540> is<00:05:32.690> that<00:05:32.840> you

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:32.960 
the thing to get about this is that you

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:35.680 
the thing to get about this is that you
can<00:05:33.110> create<00:05:33.350> a<00:05:33.440> patch<00:05:33.800> that<00:05:34.310> is<00:05:35.060> basically

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:35.690 
can create a patch that is basically

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:37.659 
can create a patch that is basically
enough<00:05:36.139> for<00:05:36.350> almost<00:05:36.530> the<00:05:36.620> whole<00:05:36.800> song<00:05:37.100> simply

00:05:37.659 --> 00:05:37.669 
enough for almost the whole song simply

00:05:37.669 --> 00:05:39.340 
enough for almost the whole song simply
by<00:05:37.760> turning<00:05:38.210> on<00:05:38.330> a<00:05:38.360> distortion<00:05:38.780> pedal<00:05:39.139> for<00:05:39.290> the

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:39.350 
by turning on a distortion pedal for the

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:41.080 
by turning on a distortion pedal for the
chorus<00:05:39.740> or<00:05:40.010> turning<00:05:40.340> on<00:05:40.400> a<00:05:40.460> delay<00:05:40.790> for<00:05:40.850> the

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:41.090 
chorus or turning on a delay for the

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:43.030 
chorus or turning on a delay for the
solo<00:05:41.480> or<00:05:41.720> something<00:05:41.870> like<00:05:42.440> that<00:05:42.500> it's<00:05:42.800> very

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:43.040 
solo or something like that it's very

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:44.879 
solo or something like that it's very
flexible<00:05:43.340> so<00:05:44.090> in<00:05:44.210> a<00:05:44.270> live<00:05:44.480> environment

00:05:44.879 --> 00:05:44.889 
flexible so in a live environment

00:05:44.889 --> 00:05:47.530 
flexible so in a live environment
there's<00:05:45.889> nothing<00:05:46.160> quite<00:05:46.250> like<00:05:46.370> using<00:05:47.030> this<00:05:47.330> to

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:47.540 
there's nothing quite like using this to

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:49.690 
there's nothing quite like using this to
set<00:05:47.750> up<00:05:47.900> a<00:05:48.020> bunch<00:05:48.590> of<00:05:48.710> tunes<00:05:49.010> in<00:05:49.310> one<00:05:49.520> fell

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:49.700 
set up a bunch of tunes in one fell

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:51.879 
set up a bunch of tunes in one fell
swoop<00:05:49.760> so<00:05:50.720> if<00:05:50.810> I<00:05:50.900> go<00:05:51.080> back<00:05:51.260> to<00:05:51.410> that<00:05:51.530> sound<00:05:51.800> we

00:05:51.879 --> 00:05:51.889 
swoop so if I go back to that sound we

00:05:51.889 --> 00:05:54.909 
swoop so if I go back to that sound we
had<00:05:52.040> before<00:05:53.200> now<00:05:54.200> I've<00:05:54.350> got<00:05:54.500> the<00:05:54.590> ability<00:05:54.680> to

00:05:54.909 --> 00:05:54.919 
had before now I've got the ability to

00:05:54.919 --> 00:05:56.590 
had before now I've got the ability to
play<00:05:55.100> my<00:05:55.220> wails<00:05:55.400> again<00:05:55.669> so<00:05:56.000> hopefully<00:05:56.450> that's

00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:56.600 
play my wails again so hopefully that's

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:58.960 
play my wails again so hopefully that's
given<00:05:56.720> you<00:05:56.870> an<00:05:56.990> idea<00:05:57.080> of<00:05:57.380> how<00:05:58.190> easy<00:05:58.220> it<00:05:58.730> is<00:05:58.850> to

00:05:58.960 --> 00:05:58.970 
given you an idea of how easy it is to

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:01.540 
given you an idea of how easy it is to
use<00:05:59.270> foot<00:05:59.660> control<00:06:00.050> with<00:06:00.680> the<00:06:00.800> 11<00:06:01.070> rack<00:06:01.220> and<00:06:01.490> a

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:01.550 
use foot control with the 11 rack and a

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:03.129 
use foot control with the 11 rack and a
live<00:06:01.730> environment<00:06:01.910> it's<00:06:02.479> pretty<00:06:02.690> cool<00:06:02.930> and

00:06:03.129 --> 00:06:03.139 
live environment it's pretty cool and

00:06:03.139 --> 00:06:05.080
