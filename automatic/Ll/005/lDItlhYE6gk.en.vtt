 samsung favorite french especially my 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.320
 favorite recipe lemon tartlet 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.420
 then I think we'll start with the 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.340
 mas by here too exactly damien finally 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.390
 to complicate absolutely no I do not 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.269
 never complicated recipes 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.859
 we start by pouring the lemon juice 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.920
 in a pot 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:31.890
 I'm too fresh a niche is too much 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:35.630
 fresh just pressed then you have 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:38.850
 well you will pass me the e traders 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:40.350
 times ok then our lemon juice is 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.559
 heating on a low heat 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.960
 because otherwise it burns very quickly 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:51.539
 I put them in a day salad bowl 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:54.660
 and yellow glide yellow ok then we 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:56.760
 pour the sugar and there we go white 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.289
 quite quickly because otherwise the 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.780
 yellow and success in reactions 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.239
 chemicals that burn digoinais 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:07.470
 in fact an oxidation 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:11.369
 ok you bleached after is way too hot 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:14.400
 that it heats perfect so I make a 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.960
 little premixes you to say that I 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.430
 pour half of the lemon juice into 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:21.360
 my camera is good not reading 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:22.650
 exact precaution I mix gently 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.830
 and there as if I feel much better 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:28.049
 today at the bottom and there I reverse 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.560
 you mix in the directly in the 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:29.970
 pan 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.000
 ok we're still on a mix game 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:36.180
 quickly for not having 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.920
 lumps and then it'll take a few 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.530
 minutes but we must continue to 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.659
 to mix all the time you have to be we have 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.320
 it's a bit brisk that you're still 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:48.210
 wind and see how far evolution 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:49.630

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:53.259
 it's really just waiting 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:54.850
 mix in fact until it's been 

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:55.180
 if it will take a few minutes but it 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:00.820
 will come 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:02:02.049
 a cream despise must be there that 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.539
