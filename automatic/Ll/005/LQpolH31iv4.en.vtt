00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:04.820
 yes, actually only with my idea of ​​the EVGA GTX 560 TI 1 b 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.210
 Ronan Keating and deals with the subject of tug-of-war 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.210
 are further according to video what I have to do exactly because 

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:16.080
 and at the beginning of the way everything you do happens at your own risk 

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:18.929
 is not liable for similar damages or other Euro inherent 

00:00:18.929 --> 00:00:21.199
 Incidentally, Robert Le Pen is also there 

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:24.949
 and yes now first demanded because our thing built Bling he increases the 

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:28.189
 Resolution on Monet and over the standard from the Briton expects 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:31.089
 back down and you get a more beautiful picture 

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:33.969
 for what the whole good game of a third game finds thrown away times 

00:00:33.969 --> 00:00:36.790
 so clothes could take off 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:39.990
 but of course you can not buy the games for example 3a can yes 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:44.440
 solve it in the wrong way 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.700
 as an example, even with wide jellyfish if you could make ten tomatoes 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.700
 Years what makes there because the graphics card and the go down to the basement 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.480
 on one on the hotel roof sometimes great with her as the whole thing works 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.380
 I have you here on mine 

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:58.370
 - gloomy monitor 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:00.390
 Appointments agree in the same way 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.960
 let's go kneeling on the desktop first 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.670
 then the NBA is in control or it seems cool windows here before 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:07.390
 us 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:10.549
 Herrenberg in the beginning resolution change demand from years to years 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:14.280
 Have 60 autumn colors from the resolution visor and 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.790
 of course here monitor factory in Wismar 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.140
 not clear 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.200
 click also customize 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:22.430
 so far 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:24.140
 Resolution and monitor can 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:27.240
 to make iodine ask Hackenheim to activate the resolution on the 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.440
 Display not that are then shows us all synonymous probably the same 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:31.700
 become equal 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.490
 Bamberg ddp the hd-resolution Grinderman try keyword euro 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:37.990
 Bonn then user here 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:41.010
 specific resolution create difficult word 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:44.690
 so this small depression seems to be now in the plates 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:45.430
 everything as it is 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:47.710
 in addition, skin and hair pixels and the vertical 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:50.710
 Rows that stress what interests us that the same 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:54.020
 «Now we have the opportunity to succeed how high we want in the 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.240
 Offensive I call it the factor 1 come 2 5 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:01.560
 then we prepare to buy 86 times at a comma 2 5 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.430
 Title at 2100 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:09.229
 about 1050 times a comma chairman at 1000 degrees back so why the pilot with 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:11.980
 A pocket calculator could also calculate that every minute per capita 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.980
 gifts 

00:02:16.039 --> 00:02:19.339
 late in the case not injured maintenance department either black bars 

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:21.319
 Aurand or kick distributed 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:22.939
 the ugly 

00:02:22.939 --> 00:02:23.979
 Prohn years 

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:26.979
 and what is the whole depending on how high he can put the part 

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:32.059
 theoretically there are no limits Photo 2 5 million searches Trier around the Ohligser 

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:35.180
 For example, the lady's pencil makes me no taller than a coma 

00:02:35.779 --> 00:02:37.889
 again a command would both 

00:02:37.889 --> 00:02:39.019
 2009 

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:40.979
 left the bankrupt five times 

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:44.809
 Another factor in the game is the cripo an artist or graphic artist may 

00:02:44.809 --> 00:02:47.809
 has too little power group that of course infinite 

00:02:48.509 --> 00:02:51.259
 and of course I have some benchmark compensation from the 

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:53.689
 dog you have learned by Grunder you can see who 

00:02:53.689 --> 00:02:55.099
 already commented a bit 

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:58.549
 and yes, there is still a writing to bring something to everyone 

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:01.700
 and logically robots liked the video again 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:03.389
 and there are still a few more catch up 

00:03:03.389 --> 00:03:04.449
 then of course 

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:07.449
 spoken at the left 

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:09.129
 See you soon on the
