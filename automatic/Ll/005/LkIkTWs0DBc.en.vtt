00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:14.090
 year that is the most awaited date for 

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:16.070
 practically all the players of the 

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:18.260
 world and is that the saga grand theft auto ' 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:20.869
 come back and come back big and we will 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:23.630
 they showed in that last trailer that 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:25.369
 we saw just a few days ago trailer in 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:28.369
 the one that was shown for the first time 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:29.890
 playable images of this title before 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:32.390
 that comes to the shelves 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:34.280
 awesome of course rockstar in 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:36.739
 this occasion has unveiled new 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:39.100
 details of grand theft auto 5 through 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:42.199
 of the Japanese publication famitsu 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:44.150
 our awesome magazine that 

00:00:42.199 --> 00:00:45.799
 magazine that we love so much 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:48.559
 very careful because in the game we are going to 

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:50.150
 have a dog called chop that 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:52.610
 we are going to have to customize 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:55.460
 changing the collar equipping him with 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:57.350
 different accessories besides we are going to 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.570
 have to worry about caring for 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:01.940
 our dog and to watch over him in everything 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:04.400
 moment because if we do not we could 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:07.010
 end up escaping and we could 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:09.590
 to be without our precious chop our 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:11.390
 pet in grand theft auto 5 curious 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:13.400
 this data on the other hand also 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:15.680
 in fact there will be more than 15 types 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:17.630
 different from wild animals the 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:20.090
 which good could already be shown in 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:22.070
 the trailer of the gameplay the week 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:24.650
 last if you remember then we saw 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:27.410
 some other animations 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:29.210
 have been another of the points where 

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:31.640
 the development team has put a 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:33.380
 great dedication something that can also be 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.810
 appreciate in the way of walking the 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:38.210
 three main characters that is a 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:40.460
 way of walking quite differently if we 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:41.869
 we are setting in each of them the 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.940
 certain that are pretty aspects 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:46.130
 important in achieving a 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:47.899
 final result of quality something that 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:50.030
 really draw our attention not in 

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:51.560
 great theft auto 5 and it's important 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:54.410
 emphasize the theme of animations 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:56.360
 because each character is unique despite 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:58.910
 that we will be able to handle three 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:01.220
 characters for the first time in the saga 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:03.110
 grand theft auto 'with its own history 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:04.820
 each of them then fixed in the 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:06.590
 emphasis that is being made on the 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:08.479
 development of each of them we go 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:10.310
 that many are even attracted to say that 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:12.500
 these are three games in one but good 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.330
 that's still to be seen but it's not what 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.850
 only one that has been commented on in the magazine 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.130
 famitsu has also been said that in grand 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:21.110
 theft auto 5 will be 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:22.970
 submarines starring maikel and 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.680
 trevor well this is something that more or 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:27.110
 least we could see because it is 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.670
 true that in the trailer you could see 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:29.660
 the odd one of those missions 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.240
 underwater 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:33.890
 the fact is that good this fifth part 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:36.530
 of grand theft auto 'you already know that 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:39.110
 has the largest city ever 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:41.600
 created by rockstar at the moment 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:44.360
 it is only confirmed at the exit of 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:46.250
 this title for playstation 3 and xbox 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:47.690
 360 a title that reaches the 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:49.880
 store shelves next 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:51.230
 September 17 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.840
 by the way if you want more information 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:56.240
 about grand theft auto 5 an analysis 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.400

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:00.260
 last week so do not miss the 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.270
 last night's podcast the voice of the gamers 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:04.790

 gamers of the voice of the gamers 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:11.870
 they analyzed all that trailer all those 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:14.180
 aspects and well we could talk about 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:16.460
 several things we also did some that 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:18.530
 another speculation about good well how 

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:20.510
 it could really be the game that arrives 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:22.730
 to the shelves and so on and it 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:24.260
 would appear or not in consoles of the 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:26.390
 next generation so 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:29.060
