 we would like to present to your attention 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:24.529
 video review of the online project which

 your style and gameplay very much 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:29.419
 reminds old kind diablo 2 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:31.160
 I will not be long pull we will focus on MMP 

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:33.440
 while the game is almost fax 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:35.960
 where are the crowds of ruthless beasts waiting for you 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:37.730
 quite a few bosses fascinating tasks and 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:40.040
 Of course, the original system 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:45.559
 skills due to which this project and 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:47.989
 became so popular to begin with you 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:50.239
 need to know that our review hey project 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:52.550
 works on fritupley payment system 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:53.329
 and therefore access to it is open to all 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:55.609
 wanting 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:57.859
 many of you probably know what if 

00:00:55.609 --> 00:01:00.170
 there is a frituple model then this 

00:00:57.859 --> 00:01:02.269
 talks about the presence of a donate shop at 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.920
 This note on the hard shop can 

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:06.260
 Immediately forget how are sold here 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.540
 Only those game items that do 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:10.310
 do not affect the balance for example the expansion 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.800
 chest for a row of visuals 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:15.320
 effects for skills different emotions for 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:18.439
 character small pets and stuff 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:20.060
 visual trifle now let's 

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:22.340
 proceed directly to the system 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.740
 character creation to get you started 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.720
 choose in which of the four regions 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:28.729
 where to play regret the Russian region 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.520
 there is no and therefore the best option for us 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:32.990
 Choose Europe with you 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:35.149
 character creation process itself 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:37.850
 simple enough and all that is from you 

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:42.020
 This is required to choose 1 of 6 gaming 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:43.100
 templar marauder classes shadow duelist 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:45.320
 archer 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:47.720
 or faithful also he should not 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:50.060
 indicate the difficulty of the game hardcore or 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:52.520
 standard in hardcore complexity enemies 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.740
 will cause increased damage if you 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.630
 die in this mode then your character 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:59.229
 automatically go to more below 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:01.700
 difficulty level that is to standard 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:04.220
 now let's consider the most 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:06.860
 interesting passive and active system 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:07.670
 skills in the game passive skills like us 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:09.679
 already said 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:12.049
 explored through a huge talent tree 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:14.420
 that is, independent of what 

00:02:12.049 --> 00:02:16.489
 cool first chosen using this 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:20.030
 tree you can pump your hero on 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:22.190
 tank mage archer et cetera on each 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:26.060
 new level your hero will get by 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:28.700
 one free skill point active 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:31.070
 sayle patches are represented as 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:33.590
 stones that are inserted in the juice 

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:36.620
 gear turn all the stones 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:37.430
 divided into three colors red blue and 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.280
 green 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:42.500
 each color shows which main 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:44.930
 Statistics need to pump this 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:47.540
 skill stone then there is a red fireplace for 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:50.769
 pumping basically requires strength green 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:53.840
 require agility well and blue intelligence 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:56.000
 such skill stones are driven in from mobs 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.069
 chests and are also given as 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.250
 awards for some completed assignments 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:03.650
 like the hero, our pebbles are pumped and 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:05.120
 getting stronger but their 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:08.709
 level cannot exceed level 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:08.709
 development of your character 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:13.760
 all the stones in the excel project 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:16.700
 divided into two groups are stones 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:18.590
 skills and stones skills stones skill 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:21.319
 give the player the opportunity to use 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:22.819
 different blows for example run discharges 

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:25.190
 fireball lightning 

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:27.950
 set traps because the mass for centuries 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:30.530
 and so on , support stones are needed for 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:33.110
 In order to strengthen the power of skill stones 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:35.030
 there they further increase the damage time 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:39.020
 actions attack speed and other 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:41.180
 impact characteristics in objects 

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:43.850
 equipment can be from one to six 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:46.280
 sockets where will you insert these 

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:48.110
 stones noticed that the presence of sockets 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:50.630
 not enough to do 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:52.430
 strongly active skill as well as their 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:54.590
 presence they must also be 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:57.410
 interconnected in simple words 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:59.360
 if juices are not connected then you will increase any 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:02.870
 The stone you inserted is not your skill. 

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:05.150
 but it turns out to be engaged in the search 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:07.640
 matching items and even with the presence of 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:09.489
 connected holes this is a venture and takeoff 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:11.959
 to facilitate this process 

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:14.810
 developers have introduced the game patch himself 

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:17.269
 some objects of the chord data pieces 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:19.970
 help the player strengthen and redo 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:22.300
 equipment items alone make hordes of 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:24.530
 white things blue yellow or orange 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:26.900
 others are able to shoot things 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:30.020
 characteristics 3 help sharpen 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:32.090
 quality equipment and skills 4 create 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:34.940
 new juices you in objects and connect them 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:37.190
 among themselves 5 change colors free 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:38.090
 stones under stones drops skill in 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:43.340
 passive tree 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:46.419
 and so on all things in the game patch fax 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:49.220
 divided into four groups white blue 

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:51.979
 yellow and orange also need to say 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:53.660
 that with the help of special orbs each 

00:04:51.979 --> 00:04:55.820
 Item can be sharpened by plus 20 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:58.310
 percent quality and if you also 

00:04:55.820 --> 00:05:00.530
 lucky the same hordes can help them 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:02.300
 make legendary clothes why am I 

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:04.789
 I say lucky yes because big 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:06.979
 portion of the same trend and act orbs 

00:05:04.789 --> 00:05:07.820
 know in advance what happens after them 

00:05:06.979 --> 00:05:10.850
 using 

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:13.250
 can not this project a little 

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:15.500
 non-standard game currency that is 

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:17.990
 cities you buy and sell items 

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:20.570
 again zorba and therefore do not waste them 

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:23.150
 anywhere and own experience I will note 

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:25.580
 what the farther acts go through by whom to play 

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:27.590
 it becomes harder in a solo game therefore 

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:29.810
 builder tread group and joint 

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:35.270
 6 people to complete the tasks and 

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:38.210
 destroy strong enemies in our time 

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:41.150
 There is practically no MMF games without 

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:43.520
 pvp content and textile fingers in this 

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:45.470
 the plan is no exception as there is 

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:47.840
 arenas where you can test your 

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:49.720
 skills on other players as well 

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:52.820
 check builds 

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:54.830
 in total in the project of pachev x style three acts 

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:55.700
 having one city from enpis 

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:58.100
 merchants 

00:05:55.700 --> 00:06:00.350
 every act turn consists more 

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:02.240
 than ten locations worth emphasizing 

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:04.490
 that all territories are constantly 

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:06.650
 are generated and therefore run like 

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:09.200
 in the same places does not bother 

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:11.030
 as soon as you pass the first act you 

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:13.220
 will be able to go to the second of three laps 

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:15.710
 difficulties well to those players who 

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:17.600
 managed to go through all the difficulties in the form 

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:20.330
 high-end content will be inserted 

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:22.340
 special cards that resemble 

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:23.450
 something like random territories with 

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:26.390
 reinforced by enemies 

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:28.460
 teacher the more enemies you come across 

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:30.620
 body is better loot with killing them you will 

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:33.110
 I can generally get a conclusion 

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:34.640
 say that by dude got where 

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:36.500
 better than diablo 3 

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:39.140
 probably the main disadvantage of them is 

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:41.000
 average by today's standards of graphics 

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:43.160
 true if you look from the other side 

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:46.850
 then this minus trifle as gaming 

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:51.040
 the process pays back its video review 

00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:51.040
