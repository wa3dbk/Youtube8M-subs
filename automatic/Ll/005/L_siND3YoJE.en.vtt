00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.709
 under the guidance of the showwoman and 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.900
 trainer rebecca golasch I visited 

00:00:13.709 --> 00:00:18.230
 again with another luisa 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.910
 her young mare has a jumping class 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:22.650
 the course taking place in the hall 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.990
 Above all, communication should be 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.060
 between horse and rider in the course 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:30.090
 strengthen 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:32.430
 I saw that the dressage work 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.190
 for the jumpers for the children 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:38.010
 just a bit neglected 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.890
 will and wants to stop with this course 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.840
 so much the dressage 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:46.110
 work between the jumps and the 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:51.690
 let loose with the horse bit 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:54.000
 ali So I'm here at the class 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.789
 with roxette that's one now 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.480
 six year old mare that we ourselves have 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.860
 drawn 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.859
 Accordingly, I have been already 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:03.629
 Six years and with that I have in 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.990
 last year jumping errors a and l 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:09.119
 won 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:11.430
 every now and then again bathing 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.880
 once in a trot grow light colors 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.250
 extend 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.360
 very well 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:20.700
 third, between the floating and 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.410
 I can not stand by the help 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.000
 not through a corner neat and 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:26.670
 do not come with it properly 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.259
 It does not start to let go and jump 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.530
 therefore can not over the back 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:33.420
 Many aspects of jumping are easy 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:37.160
 for a good basic education in the 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.160
 dressage are very important 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:45.689
 not that bad a bit that 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:49.140
 jump left left 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:51.060
 dani no problem working so well 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.750
 work work work works 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:57.600
 work work 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:58.469
 prÃ©mat luisa yes well as good 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.250
 rhythm 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:03.990
 you should not just sit on it 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:05.640
 so to speak simply jumped board 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.129
 but you should also the distances 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.110
 you can see and ride straight on 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:12.510
 that is important for youth 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.220
 they are trained to be on 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.110
 hear the rider that they grow up 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:21.930
 to spark but as well 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:27.239
 can come back well and leg and 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:29.160
 Hand before the election fell in the dressage 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:31.860
 normal treskow also comes over the 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.989
 outer pulls over the inner leg and 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:36.569
 We practiced that specifically because in the 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:38.700
 The corners are very important if 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:40.650
 the riders and the horses are not 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.959
 Know neatly through a corner 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:46.220
 galloping or widening becomes time 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:46.220
 to consider difficult jump 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:03:00.220
 1235 very good luisa very nice straight 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:02.530
 have good rhythm so well today 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:04.900
 we based on yesterday 's corners 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:07.870
 ride and ride out of the corners in the 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:10.300
 corner riding a bit repeatedly 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:14.530
 have parcours cutouts today 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:17.440
 curved lines straight lines and 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:19.990
 want to jump all the way tomorrow 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:22.950
 where everything is in and then look 

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:22.950
 how it will be then
