what we get with a dress like this is

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.240

think that what you really get from this

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:27.149 
think that what you really get from this
is<00:03:24.849> a<00:03:25.329> dress<00:03:25.720> that<00:03:25.750> a<00:03:26.109> like<00:03:26.500> you<00:03:26.650> said<00:03:26.859> you<00:03:27.010> feel

00:03:27.149 --> 00:03:27.159 
is a dress that a like you said you feel

00:03:27.159 --> 00:03:28.800

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:28.810 
very comfortable in they've got the

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:30.780 
very comfortable in they've got the
draping<00:03:29.139> and<00:03:29.620> it's<00:03:29.769> like<00:03:29.949> wrap<00:03:30.310> a<00:03:30.549> wrap<00:03:30.729> dress

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790 
draping and it's like wrap a wrap dress

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:32.610 
draping and it's like wrap a wrap dress
or<00:03:31.389> something<00:03:31.540> that<00:03:31.810> has<00:03:31.989> all<00:03:32.319> of<00:03:32.349> those

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:32.620 
or something that has all of those

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:34.949 
or something that has all of those
pleats<00:03:33.040> it<00:03:33.519> just<00:03:34.060> sort<00:03:34.269> of<00:03:34.329> brings<00:03:34.690> in<00:03:34.870> a

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:34.959 
pleats it just sort of brings in a

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:37.979 
pleats it just sort of brings in a
little<00:03:35.199> bit<00:03:35.319> more<00:03:35.530> of<00:03:35.769> a<00:03:36.010> line<00:03:36.190> for<00:03:36.489> you<00:03:36.609> and<00:03:36.989> I

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:37.989 
little bit more of a line for you and I

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:40.110 
little bit more of a line for you and I
think<00:03:38.229> the<00:03:38.319> sleeve<00:03:38.650> is<00:03:38.680> incredibly<00:03:39.489> tasteful

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:40.120 
think the sleeve is incredibly tasteful

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:41.699 
think the sleeve is incredibly tasteful
and<00:03:40.329> I<00:03:40.449> think<00:03:40.659> what<00:03:40.750> this<00:03:40.900> will<00:03:41.139> help<00:03:41.290> show<00:03:41.650> you

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:41.709 
and I think what this will help show you

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:45.839 
and I think what this will help show you
is<00:03:42.129> how<00:03:42.159> your<00:03:43.090> other<00:03:43.269> outfit<00:03:43.750> was<00:03:43.930> fine<00:03:44.849> but

00:03:45.839 --> 00:03:45.849 
is how your other outfit was fine but

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:47.550 
is how your other outfit was fine but
this<00:03:46.449> is<00:03:46.510> something<00:03:46.900> that's<00:03:47.079> a<00:03:47.290> little<00:03:47.409> bit

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:47.560 
this is something that's a little bit
