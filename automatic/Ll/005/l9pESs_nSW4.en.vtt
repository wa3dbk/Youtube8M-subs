00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:29.590 
version is a completely different intro

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:36.600 
version is a completely different intro
they<00:03:30.400> do<00:03:30.459> things<00:03:30.880> a<00:03:31.030> little<00:03:31.150> differently

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:36.610 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:40.150

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:40.160 
they do some funny things I decided to

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:41.770 
they do some funny things I decided to
make<00:03:40.310> it<00:03:40.340> just<00:03:40.459> a<00:03:40.730> hair<00:03:40.760> more<00:03:41.150> bluesy<00:03:41.660> and

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:41.780 
make it just a hair more bluesy and

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:44.199 
make it just a hair more bluesy and
what's<00:03:42.010> infectious<00:03:43.010> about<00:03:43.160> this<00:03:43.520> song<00:03:43.819> is

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:44.209 
what's infectious about this song is

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:46.900 
what's infectious about this song is
going<00:03:44.780> from<00:03:45.230> major<00:03:46.040> 7

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:46.910 
going from major 7

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:51.280 
going from major 7
the<00:03:47.810> dominant<00:03:48.380> 7<00:03:48.830> and<00:03:49.819> then<00:03:50.000> to<00:03:50.840> the<00:03:50.989> four

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:51.290 
the dominant 7 and then to the four

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:55.930 
the dominant 7 and then to the four
dominant<00:03:51.650> chord<00:03:52.239> so<00:03:53.860> but<00:03:54.860> I<00:03:54.890> ended<00:03:55.310> sticking

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:55.940 
dominant chord so but I ended sticking

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:58.180 
dominant chord so but I ended sticking
that<00:03:56.090> sixth<00:03:56.690> in<00:03:56.840> there<00:03:57.020> as<00:03:57.140> well<00:03:57.319> so<00:03:57.620> that's

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:58.190 
that sixth in there as well so that's

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:02.979 
that sixth in there as well so that's
our<00:03:58.400> intro<00:03:58.850> kind<00:03:59.150> of<00:03:59.270> that<00:04:01.360> and<00:04:02.360> so<00:04:02.810> that's

00:04:02.979 --> 00:04:02.989 
our intro kind of that and so that's

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:07.180 
our intro kind of that and so that's
what<00:04:03.290> I<00:04:03.319> like<00:04:03.560> to<00:04:03.590> use<00:04:03.950> for<00:04:04.250> them<00:04:04.599> now<00:04:05.800> also<00:04:06.800> on

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:07.190 
what I like to use for them now also on

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:12.340 
what I like to use for them now also on
this<00:04:07.610> tune<00:04:08.260> it<00:04:09.260> gets<00:04:09.530> a<00:04:09.680> little<00:04:09.860> tricky<00:04:11.350> when

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:12.350 
this tune it gets a little tricky when

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:14.289 
this tune it gets a little tricky when
we<00:04:12.560> get<00:04:12.830> up<00:04:12.980> really<00:04:13.220> high<00:04:13.580> like<00:04:13.819> this<00:04:14.060> but<00:04:14.269> I

00:04:14.289 --> 00:04:14.299 
we get up really high like this but I

00:04:14.299 --> 00:04:16.509 
we get up really high like this but I
wanted<00:04:14.630> to<00:04:14.690> put<00:04:14.959> it<00:04:15.080> in<00:04:15.140> the<00:04:15.230> key<00:04:15.410> of<00:04:15.440> E<00:04:15.680> so<00:04:16.489> we

00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:16.519 
wanted to put it in the key of E so we

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:19.629 
wanted to put it in the key of E so we
can<00:04:16.729> have<00:04:16.910> those<00:04:17.090> low<00:04:17.359> bass<00:04:17.630> notes<00:04:18.019> and<00:04:18.639> it's

00:04:19.629 --> 00:04:19.639 
can have those low bass notes and it's

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:22.810 
can have those low bass notes and it's
got<00:04:19.820> that<00:04:19.940> bluesy<00:04:20.510> kind<00:04:20.720> of<00:04:20.870> feel<00:04:21.190> so<00:04:22.190> if

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:22.820 
got that bluesy kind of feel so if

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:25.750 
got that bluesy kind of feel so if
you're<00:04:23.440> stumbling<00:04:24.440> around<00:04:24.740> up<00:04:25.130> top<00:04:25.400> here

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:25.760 
you're stumbling around up top here

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:37.100 
you're stumbling around up top here
really<00:04:26.570> high<00:04:29.320> don't<00:04:30.320> feel<00:04:30.530> all<00:04:30.710> alone

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:37.110 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:39.780 

but<00:04:38.110> you<00:04:38.290> can<00:04:38.440> get<00:04:38.620> it<00:04:38.770> you<00:04:39.100> looking<00:04:39.340> you<00:04:39.580> can

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:39.790 
but you can get it you looking you can

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:42.330 
but you can get it you looking you can
get<00:04:39.970> it<00:04:40.120> and<00:04:40.720> so<00:04:41.350> I<00:04:41.380> said<00:04:41.680> I<00:04:41.710> think<00:04:41.980> it's<00:04:42.100> a<00:04:42.160> nice

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:42.340 
get it and so I said I think it's a nice

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:46.140 
get it and so I said I think it's a nice
old<00:04:43.020> -<00:04:44.020> and<00:04:44.200> it's<00:04:44.830> a<00:04:44.950> nice<00:04:45.100> arrangement<00:04:45.430> I've

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:46.150 
old - and it's a nice arrangement I've

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:48.270 
old - and it's a nice arrangement I've
stole<00:04:46.630> a<00:04:46.660> couple<00:04:46.900> of<00:04:47.170> licks<00:04:47.410> off<00:04:47.740> this<00:04:47.980> and<00:04:48.220> I

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:48.280 
stole a couple of licks off this and I

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:50.760 
stole a couple of licks off this and I
think<00:04:48.520> there's<00:04:48.730> an<00:04:48.910> interesting<00:04:49.300> thing<00:04:49.660> on<00:04:50.080> on

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:50.770 
think there's an interesting thing on on

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:53.850 
think there's an interesting thing on on
this<00:04:51.270> song<00:04:52.270> you<00:04:52.570> know<00:04:52.690> it<00:04:52.840> it's<00:04:53.380> in<00:04:53.560> the<00:04:53.650> key<00:04:53.830> of

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:53.860 
this song you know it it's in the key of

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:56.130 
this song you know it it's in the key of
E<00:04:54.040> major<00:04:54.250> the<00:04:54.670> bridge<00:04:54.910> modulates<00:04:55.750> to<00:04:56.050> the

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:56.140 
E major the bridge modulates to the

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:59.370 
E major the bridge modulates to the
relative<00:04:56.560> minor<00:04:56.770> C<00:04:57.580> sharp<00:04:57.880> minor<00:04:58.120> like<00:04:59.110> a<00:04:59.140> lot

00:04:59.370 --> 00:04:59.380 
relative minor C sharp minor like a lot

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:02.700 
relative minor C sharp minor like a lot
of<00:04:59.500> tunes<00:04:59.710> like<00:05:00.010> Georgia<00:05:00.550> and<00:05:00.700> stuff<00:05:01.200> but<00:05:02.200> what

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:02.710 
of tunes like Georgia and stuff but what

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:05.160 
of tunes like Georgia and stuff but what
they<00:05:02.860> use<00:05:03.130> as<00:05:03.460> a<00:05:03.760> transitional<00:05:04.510> device<00:05:04.720> I

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:05.170 
they use as a transitional device I

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:06.510 
they use as a transitional device I
think<00:05:05.410> is<00:05:05.500> very<00:05:05.680> interesting

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:06.520 
think is very interesting

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:11.100 
think is very interesting
going<00:05:07.060> into<00:05:07.210> key<00:05:07.450> of<00:05:07.540> E<00:05:08.640> and<00:05:09.640> then<00:05:09.880> then<00:05:10.240> he<00:05:10.270> our

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:11.110 
going into key of E and then then he our

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:15.630 
going into key of E and then then he our
target<00:05:11.620> is<00:05:11.740> C<00:05:12.100> sharp<00:05:12.370> minor<00:05:12.660> so<00:05:14.460> what<00:05:15.460> they<00:05:15.550> do

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:15.640 
target is C sharp minor so what they do

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:17.310 
target is C sharp minor so what they do
in<00:05:15.880> the<00:05:15.970> Billie<00:05:16.150> Holiday<00:05:16.660> arrangement<00:05:17.200> is

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:17.320 
in the Billie Holiday arrangement is

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:19.410 
in the Billie Holiday arrangement is
they<00:05:17.500> go<00:05:17.680> up<00:05:17.830> to<00:05:17.860> F<00:05:18.100> sharp<00:05:18.130> minor<00:05:18.550> seven<00:05:19.120> five

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:19.420 
they go up to F sharp minor seven five

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:24.240 
they go up to F sharp minor seven five
five<00:05:20.370> B<00:05:21.370> flat<00:05:21.610> dominant<00:05:22.170> flat<00:05:23.170> minor<00:05:23.410> seven<00:05:23.860> a

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:24.250 
five B flat dominant flat minor seven a

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:26.640 
five B flat dominant flat minor seven a
flat<00:05:25.180> dominant<00:05:25.690> and<00:05:25.780> then<00:05:25.870> that<00:05:26.110> takes<00:05:26.410> us<00:05:26.620> to

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:26.650 
flat dominant and then that takes us to

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:29.850 
flat dominant and then that takes us to
that<00:05:26.950> D<00:05:27.340> flat<00:05:27.670> or<00:05:27.850> C<00:05:28.000> sharp<00:05:28.330> so<00:05:29.320> it's<00:05:29.500> a<00:05:29.560> kind<00:05:29.800> of

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:29.860 
that D flat or C sharp so it's a kind of

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:32.370 
that D flat or C sharp so it's a kind of
a<00:05:29.950> cool<00:05:30.160> sound<00:05:30.640> coming<00:05:31.000> from<00:05:31.120> even<00:05:31.870> and<00:05:32.020> also
