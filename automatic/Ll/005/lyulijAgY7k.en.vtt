improvements<00:01:09.540> to<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:09.780> existing<00:01:10.200> ones<00:01:10.350> they

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
improvements to the existing ones they

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:11.810 
improvements to the existing ones they
just<00:01:10.619> probably<00:01:10.710> won't<00:01:11.040> be<00:01:11.130> adding<00:01:11.460> like<00:01:11.580> a<00:01:11.670> new

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
just probably won't be adding like a new

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.120 
just probably won't be adding like a new
mod<00:01:12.030> or<00:01:12.240> something<00:01:12.570> for<00:01:12.990> 1.8<00:01:13.409> at<00:01:13.590> this<00:01:13.799> point

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
mod or something for 1.8 at this point

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.859 
mod or something for 1.8 at this point
since<00:01:14.610> it's<00:01:14.760> so<00:01:14.909> late<00:01:15.210> in<00:01:15.420> the<00:01:15.540> update

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
since it's so late in the update

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.840 
since it's so late in the update
development<00:01:16.409> now<00:01:16.799> developer<00:01:17.189> sayers<00:01:17.460> also

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
development now developer sayers also

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.149 
development now developer sayers also
added<00:01:18.240> my<00:01:18.420> guess<00:01:18.689> is<00:01:18.960> that<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:19.320> 1.8<00:01:19.799> update

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
added my guess is that the 1.8 update

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.070 
added my guess is that the 1.8 update
changes<00:01:20.490> almost<00:01:20.729> all<00:01:21.060> source<00:01:21.540> files<00:01:21.840> in

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
changes almost all source files in

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.620 
changes almost all source files in
minecraft<00:01:22.530> since<00:01:22.799> 1.7<00:01:23.580> it's<00:01:23.939> a<00:01:24.090> huge<00:01:24.390> step

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630

release now one thing I wanted to add
about<00:01:48.270> the<00:01:48.390> rabbits<00:01:48.930> when<00:01:49.380> I<00:01:49.439> originally

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
about the rabbits when I originally

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.350 
about the rabbits when I originally
played<00:01:50.189> the<00:01:50.430> first<00:01:50.579> snapshot<00:01:50.880> with<00:01:51.149> them<00:01:51.270> I

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
played the first snapshot with them I

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.760 
played the first snapshot with them I
couldn't<00:01:51.540> find<00:01:51.780> them<00:01:51.930> in<00:01:52.020> the<00:01:52.079> wild<00:01:52.229> anywhere

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
couldn't find them in the wild anywhere

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.649 
couldn't find them in the wild anywhere
but<00:01:52.979> as<00:01:53.070> you<00:01:53.189> can<00:01:53.310> see<00:01:53.520> they're<00:01:53.759> all<00:01:53.970> over<00:01:54.420> here

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
but as you can see they're all over here

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.080 
but as you can see they're all over here
in<00:01:54.840> this<00:01:55.229> taiga<00:01:55.710> and<00:01:55.829> megataiga<00:01:56.219> area<00:01:56.700> they

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
in this taiga and megataiga area they

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.910 
in this taiga and megataiga area they
spawn<00:01:57.329> in<00:01:57.509> most<00:01:57.719> biomes<00:01:58.170> it<00:01:58.350> seems<00:01:58.590> a<00:01:58.740> lot<00:01:58.860> of

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
spawn in most biomes it seems a lot of

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.410 
spawn in most biomes it seems a lot of
people<00:01:59.159> were<00:01:59.250> letting<00:01:59.549> me<00:01:59.640> know<00:01:59.969> that<00:02:00.329> they

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
people were letting me know that they

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.060 
people were letting me know that they
saw<00:02:00.659> them<00:02:00.840> in<00:02:00.960> the<00:02:01.049> snapshot<00:02:01.469> so<00:02:01.860> yeah<00:02:01.950> the

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
saw them in the snapshot so yeah the

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.950 
saw them in the snapshot so yeah the
rabbits<00:02:02.340> are<00:02:02.490> already<00:02:02.880> spawning<00:02:03.210> if<00:02:03.630> they<00:02:03.810> get

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
rabbits are already spawning if they get

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.840 
rabbits are already spawning if they get
their<00:02:04.110> sound<00:02:04.320> effects<00:02:04.680> as<00:02:04.860> the<00:02:04.890> MOG<00:02:05.219> miner<00:02:05.520> was

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
their sound effects as the MOG miner was

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.479 
their sound effects as the MOG miner was
inquiring<00:02:06.509> about<00:02:06.659> with<00:02:07.110> the<00:02:07.320> composer<00:02:07.710> c418

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
inquiring about with the composer c418

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.070 
inquiring about with the composer c418
then<00:02:09.060> that<00:02:09.270> would<00:02:09.390> be<00:02:09.420> really<00:02:09.509> cool<00:02:09.810> I'd<00:02:09.959> like

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
then that would be really cool I'd like

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.830 
then that would be really cool I'd like
to<00:02:10.200> hear<00:02:10.319> these<00:02:10.470> guys<00:02:10.649> actually<00:02:10.830> make<00:02:11.190> sound

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.050 

so<00:02:14.840> the<00:02:15.170> updates<00:02:15.530> this<00:02:15.770> week<00:02:15.830> in<00:02:16.580> the<00:02:16.820> snapshot

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
so the updates this week in the snapshot

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.390 
so the updates this week in the snapshot
surfers<00:02:18.020> and<00:02:18.260> the<00:02:18.500> single<00:02:18.830> player<00:02:19.010> client

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
surfers and the single player client

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.010 
surfers and the single player client
actually<00:02:19.520> had<00:02:19.790> a<00:02:19.820> big<00:02:20.150> update<00:02:20.360> in<00:02:20.660> terms<00:02:20.870> of

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:21.020 
actually had a big update in terms of

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:22.870 
actually had a big update in terms of
optimizations<00:02:21.740> they<00:02:21.950> now<00:02:22.100> run<00:02:22.400> a<00:02:22.580> lot<00:02:22.850> more

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:22.880 
optimizations they now run a lot more

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:24.760 
optimizations they now run a lot more
smoothly<00:02:23.450> so<00:02:24.080> it<00:02:24.140> should<00:02:24.290> be<00:02:24.320> good<00:02:24.560> especially

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:24.770 
smoothly so it should be good especially

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:26.680 
smoothly so it should be good especially
for<00:02:25.100> people<00:02:25.460> with<00:02:25.550> lower<00:02:25.730> end<00:02:26.000> computers<00:02:26.510> and

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
for people with lower end computers and

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:29.500 
for people with lower end computers and
servers<00:02:27.200> can<00:02:27.650> now<00:02:27.770> choose<00:02:28.130> to<00:02:28.460> customize<00:02:29.270> the

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 
servers can now choose to customize the

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:31.270 
servers can now choose to customize the
network<00:02:29.840> compression<00:02:30.500> in<00:02:30.650> their<00:02:31.040> server

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
network compression in their server

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.400 
network compression in their server
properties<00:02:31.550> meaning<00:02:32.420> they<00:02:32.720> can<00:02:32.930> send<00:02:33.230> out

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:33.410 
properties meaning they can send out

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:35.770 
properties meaning they can send out
less<00:02:33.800> data<00:02:34.160> which<00:02:34.760> will<00:02:34.910> mean<00:02:35.060> less<00:02:35.300> network

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
less data which will mean less network

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:37.750 
less data which will mean less network
lag<00:02:36.050> but<00:02:36.410> it<00:02:36.500> also<00:02:36.650> means<00:02:36.980> that<00:02:37.100> people<00:02:37.700> are

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
lag but it also means that people are

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.190 
lag but it also means that people are
going<00:02:37.820> to<00:02:37.940> need<00:02:38.090> a<00:02:38.120> bit<00:02:38.390> of<00:02:38.420> a<00:02:38.630> better<00:02:38.780> computer

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
going to need a bit of a better computer

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:40.750 
going to need a bit of a better computer
to<00:02:39.470> run<00:02:39.620> it<00:02:39.770> so<00:02:39.920> this<00:02:40.040> is<00:02:40.190> up<00:02:40.310> to<00:02:40.340> the<00:02:40.520> server

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
to run it so this is up to the server

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.640 
to run it so this is up to the server
whether<00:02:41.030> they<00:02:41.270> want<00:02:41.450> to<00:02:41.510> do<00:02:41.630> it<00:02:41.780> most<00:02:42.230> servers

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
whether they want to do it most servers

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:44.890 
whether they want to do it most servers
will<00:02:42.890> probably<00:02:43.400> try<00:02:43.880> to<00:02:43.910> take<00:02:44.209> the<00:02:44.390> brunt<00:02:44.660> of

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
will probably try to take the brunt of

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.630 
will probably try to take the brunt of
the<00:02:45.140> work<00:02:45.170> on<00:02:45.590> themselves<00:02:46.040> because<00:02:46.400> most

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:46.640 
the work on themselves because most

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:47.920 
the work on themselves because most
players<00:02:46.760> might<00:02:47.180> not<00:02:47.330> be<00:02:47.450> playing<00:02:47.660> with<00:02:47.900> a

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
players might not be playing with a

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:49.660 
players might not be playing with a
super-fast<00:02:48.380> computer<00:02:48.860> but<00:02:49.220> it's<00:02:49.340> nice<00:02:49.520> to

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
super-fast computer but it's nice to

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:51.190 
super-fast computer but it's nice to
know<00:02:49.790> that<00:02:49.970> you<00:02:50.060> have<00:02:50.209> options<00:02:50.510> to<00:02:50.959> make<00:02:51.050> the

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:54.380 
lag alleviated on a few servers now down

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:56.380 
lag alleviated on a few servers now down
here<00:02:54.410> we've<00:02:55.010> got<00:02:55.160> a<00:02:55.220> new<00:02:55.400> feature<00:02:55.670> this<00:02:56.120> little

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390 
here we've got a new feature this little

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:57.790 
here we've got a new feature this little
bunny<00:02:56.570> rabbits<00:02:56.930> sitting<00:02:57.080> right<00:02:57.350> on<00:02:57.500> it

so<00:02:58.010> in<00:02:58.280> the<00:02:58.430> past<00:02:58.640> enchantments<00:02:59.570> and<00:02:59.720> potion

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:00.260 
so in the past enchantments and potion

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:01.390 
so in the past enchantments and potion
effects<00:03:00.560> you<00:03:00.680> would<00:03:00.800> have<00:03:00.920> to<00:03:01.040> actually<00:03:01.100> use

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 
effects you would have to actually use

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.460 
effects you would have to actually use
numbers<00:03:01.910> to<00:03:02.510> pick<00:03:02.750> which<00:03:02.900> one<00:03:03.110> you<00:03:03.200> wanted<00:03:03.410> to

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.470 
numbers to pick which one you wanted to

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:04.930 
numbers to pick which one you wanted to
do<00:03:03.650> so<00:03:03.860> I<00:03:03.890> would<00:03:03.980> always<00:03:04.130> have<00:03:04.310> to<00:03:04.459> like<00:03:04.610> open

in the name now you put in how long you
want<00:03:12.620> it<00:03:12.709> for<00:03:12.980> and<00:03:13.220> then<00:03:13.459> what<00:03:13.880> level<00:03:14.180> it<00:03:14.330> is

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:14.360 
want it for and then what level it is

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.300 
want it for and then what level it is
and<00:03:14.720> you<00:03:15.050> can<00:03:15.200> put<00:03:15.380> true<00:03:15.650> if<00:03:15.800> you<00:03:15.920> don't<00:03:16.130> want

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:16.310 
and you can put true if you don't want

and you can put true if you don't want
particles<00:03:16.790> to<00:03:16.940> fly<00:03:17.090> around<00:03:17.209> now<00:03:17.450> I<00:03:17.480> have<00:03:17.720> jump

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:17.959 
particles to fly around now I have jump

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:19.390 
particles to fly around now I have jump
boost<00:03:18.200> you<00:03:18.650> can<00:03:18.709> do<00:03:18.890> the<00:03:19.040> same<00:03:19.190> with

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:19.400 
boost you can do the same with

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.220 
boost you can do the same with
enchantments<00:03:20.150> like<00:03:20.300> if<00:03:20.390> I<00:03:20.510> had<00:03:20.660> a<00:03:20.690> sword<00:03:20.989> in<00:03:21.200> my

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:21.230 
enchantments like if I had a sword in my

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:23.470 
enchantments like if I had a sword in my
hand<00:03:21.620> and<00:03:21.830> I<00:03:22.160> use<00:03:22.340> sharpness<00:03:22.940> I<00:03:23.150> just<00:03:23.330> put

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:23.480 
hand and I use sharpness I just put

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.420 
hand and I use sharpness I just put
level<00:03:23.720> 5<00:03:23.930> then<00:03:24.410> you<00:03:24.500> can<00:03:24.620> very<00:03:24.800> easily<00:03:24.860> get<00:03:25.370> a

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:25.430 
level 5 then you can very easily get a

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:27.340 
level 5 then you can very easily get a
sharpness<00:03:25.760> 5<00:03:26.060> enchantment<00:03:26.660> so<00:03:26.989> yeah<00:03:27.110> this<00:03:27.290> is

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:27.350 
sharpness 5 enchantment so yeah this is

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:29.259 
sharpness 5 enchantment so yeah this is
a<00:03:27.470> very<00:03:27.739> quick<00:03:28.100> way<00:03:28.160> to<00:03:28.370> get<00:03:28.700> enchantments<00:03:29.209> and

00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:29.269 
a very quick way to get enchantments and

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:30.940 
a very quick way to get enchantments and
potion<00:03:29.570> effects<00:03:29.840> without<00:03:30.380> needing<00:03:30.709> to<00:03:30.739> know

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:32.450 
all the different ID numbers kind of

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:34.509 
all the different ID numbers kind of
like<00:03:32.570> the<00:03:32.660> blocks<00:03:32.930> got<00:03:33.200> switched<00:03:33.440> over<00:03:33.800> now<00:03:34.280> in

00:03:34.509 --> 00:03:34.519 
like the blocks got switched over now in

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:36.400 
like the blocks got switched over now in
video<00:03:34.730> settings<00:03:35.420> this<00:03:35.810> was<00:03:36.019> a<00:03:36.050> new<00:03:36.230> feature

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:36.410 
video settings this was a new feature

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:38.979 
video settings this was a new feature
recently<00:03:36.709> in<00:03:37.160> the<00:03:37.580> last<00:03:38.120> couple<00:03:38.300> snapshots<00:03:38.660> we

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:38.989 
recently in the last couple snapshots we

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:41.320 
recently in the last couple snapshots we
got<00:03:39.140> these<00:03:39.260> alternative<00:03:40.040> blocks<00:03:40.430> which<00:03:41.060> means

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:41.330 
got these alternative blocks which means

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:42.789 
got these alternative blocks which means
you<00:03:41.480> can<00:03:41.630> have<00:03:41.750> variations<00:03:42.350> on<00:03:42.500> the<00:03:42.590> blocks

00:03:42.789 --> 00:03:42.799 
you can have variations on the blocks

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:45.789 
you can have variations on the blocks
like<00:03:43.040> maybe<00:03:43.370> a<00:03:43.670> chunk<00:03:44.150> of<00:03:44.360> dirt<00:03:44.570> that<00:03:44.870> has<00:03:45.140> like

00:04:39.249 --> 00:04:39.259 
this way and if you don't want it though

00:04:39.259 --> 00:04:40.600 
this way and if you don't want it though
you<00:04:39.319> can<00:04:39.560> just<00:04:39.590> turn<00:04:39.830> it<00:04:39.949> off<00:04:40.039> in<00:04:40.220> the<00:04:40.280> options

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:40.610 
you can just turn it off in the options

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:42.820 
you can just turn it off in the options
very<00:04:40.849> easily<00:04:41.060> with<00:04:41.840> that<00:04:42.050> new<00:04:42.259> alternative

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:42.830 
very easily with that new alternative

so that all the blocks used block States

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:51.369 
so that all the blocks used block States
now<00:04:49.460> making<00:04:50.120> the<00:04:50.240> game<00:04:50.419> a<00:04:50.629> bit<00:04:50.900> quicker<00:04:51.259> and

his<00:05:30.710> screen<00:05:31.039> so<00:05:31.490> he<00:05:31.699> added<00:05:31.909> a<00:05:32.240> new<00:05:32.539> feature

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:35.290 
his screen so he added a new feature
called<00:05:33.259> reduced<00:05:33.979> debug<00:05:34.520> info<00:05:34.909> and<00:05:35.090> you<00:05:35.150> can

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:35.300 
called reduced debug info and you can

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:37.089 
called reduced debug info and you can
toggle<00:05:35.449> this<00:05:35.750> in<00:05:35.900> the<00:05:35.990> options<00:05:36.500> in<00:05:36.770> future

00:05:37.089 --> 00:05:37.099 
toggle this in the options in future

snapshots<00:05:37.580> but<00:05:38.000> it<00:05:38.090> basically<00:05:38.180> makes<00:05:38.630> it<00:05:38.779> so

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:38.960 
snapshots but it basically makes it so

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:40.600 
snapshots but it basically makes it so
that<00:05:39.139> there's<00:05:39.349> less<00:05:39.409> info<00:05:40.039> here<00:05:40.250> you<00:05:40.340> get<00:05:40.460> the

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:40.610 
that there's less info here you get the

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:42.279 
that there's less info here you get the
coordinates<00:05:41.029> and<00:05:41.300> your<00:05:41.750> frame<00:05:41.990> rate<00:05:42.169> and

00:05:42.279 --> 00:05:42.289 
coordinates and your frame rate and

00:05:42.289 --> 00:05:43.839 
coordinates and your frame rate and
stuff<00:05:42.469> but<00:05:42.560> you<00:05:42.650> don't<00:05:42.710> get<00:05:42.919> all<00:05:43.130> of<00:05:43.310> this<00:05:43.460> info

00:05:43.839 --> 00:05:43.849 
stuff but you don't get all of this info

00:05:43.849 --> 00:05:46.029 
stuff but you don't get all of this info
so<00:05:44.029> it's<00:05:44.150> a<00:05:44.210> lot<00:05:44.360> easier<00:05:44.690> to<00:05:44.840> explore<00:05:45.229> and<00:05:45.469> just

00:05:46.029 --> 00:05:46.039 
so it's a lot easier to explore and just

00:05:46.039 --> 00:05:47.350 
so it's a lot easier to explore and just
have<00:05:46.159> your<00:05:46.279> coordinates<00:05:46.699> popped<00:05:46.940> up<00:05:47.150> there

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:47.360 
have your coordinates popped up there

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:49.180 
have your coordinates popped up there
but<00:05:47.810> the<00:05:47.930> fact<00:05:48.050> that<00:05:48.169> he's<00:05:48.380> asking<00:05:48.889> if<00:05:49.039> you

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:49.190 
but the fact that he's asking if you

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:51.700 
but the fact that he's asking if you
like<00:05:49.490> exploration<00:05:50.360> or<00:05:50.569> building<00:05:51.020> more<00:05:51.259> makes

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:51.710 
like exploration or building more makes

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:53.080 
like exploration or building more makes
me<00:05:51.860> think<00:05:52.069> that<00:05:52.190> he's<00:05:52.370> thinking<00:05:52.699> about<00:05:52.909> some

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:53.090 
me think that he's thinking about some

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:55.059 
me think that he's thinking about some
other<00:05:53.150> new<00:05:53.389> features<00:05:53.750> to<00:05:53.779> add<00:05:54.050> in<00:05:54.259> the<00:05:54.349> game<00:05:54.529> so

00:05:55.059 --> 00:05:55.069 
other new features to add in the game so

00:05:55.069 --> 00:05:57.219 
other new features to add in the game so
a<00:05:55.099> few<00:05:55.490> bug<00:05:55.639> fixes<00:05:56.029> before<00:05:56.360> we<00:05:56.479> finish<00:05:56.750> up<00:05:56.900> here

00:05:57.219 --> 00:05:57.229 
a few bug fixes before we finish up here

00:05:57.229 --> 00:05:59.649 
a few bug fixes before we finish up here
TNT<00:05:57.979> had<00:05:58.250> some<00:05:58.490> really<00:05:58.639> bad<00:05:58.729> z-fighting

00:05:59.649 --> 00:05:59.659 
TNT had some really bad z-fighting

00:05:59.659 --> 00:06:02.019 
TNT had some really bad z-fighting
that's<00:06:00.110> when<00:06:00.289> textures<00:06:00.740> seemed<00:06:01.129> to<00:06:01.279> overlap

00:06:02.019 --> 00:06:02.029 
that's when textures seemed to overlap

00:06:02.029 --> 00:06:03.820 
that's when textures seemed to overlap
when<00:06:02.300> they're<00:06:02.449> flat<00:06:02.659> it's<00:06:02.900> like<00:06:03.080> the<00:06:03.229> the<00:06:03.469> TNT

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:03.830 
when they're flat it's like the the TNT

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:05.320 
when they're flat it's like the the TNT
texture<00:06:04.190> on<00:06:04.340> the<00:06:04.460> side<00:06:04.669> here<00:06:04.879> would<00:06:05.000> go<00:06:05.150> over

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:05.330 
texture on the side here would go over

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:06.939 
texture on the side here would go over
that<00:06:05.569> and<00:06:05.990> it<00:06:06.110> would<00:06:06.199> have<00:06:06.289> a<00:06:06.349> lot<00:06:06.560> of<00:06:06.590> weird

00:06:06.939 --> 00:06:06.949 
that and it would have a lot of weird

00:06:06.949 --> 00:06:09.189 
that and it would have a lot of weird
collision<00:06:07.879> where<00:06:08.090> it<00:06:08.180> would<00:06:08.300> look<00:06:08.419> all<00:06:08.599> like<00:06:08.930> a

00:06:09.189 --> 00:06:09.199 
collision where it would look all like a

00:06:09.199 --> 00:06:11.290 
collision where it would look all like a
staticky<00:06:10.159> and<00:06:10.190> stuff<00:06:10.460> but<00:06:10.610> now<00:06:10.729> it's<00:06:10.909> just<00:06:11.029> one

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:11.300 
staticky and stuff but now it's just one

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:13.330 
staticky and stuff but now it's just one
solid<00:06:11.870> thing<00:06:12.139> when<00:06:12.409> you<00:06:12.560> uh<00:06:12.590> when<00:06:13.219> you

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:13.340 
solid thing when you uh when you

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:15.249 
solid thing when you uh when you
detonate<00:06:13.580> TNT<00:06:14.270> there<00:06:14.539> a<00:06:14.719> few<00:06:15.020> other<00:06:15.199> things

00:06:15.249 --> 00:06:15.259 
detonate TNT there a few other things

00:06:15.259 --> 00:06:16.990 
detonate TNT there a few other things
rain<00:06:15.740> was<00:06:15.979> going<00:06:16.219> through<00:06:16.370> upside<00:06:16.819> down

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:17.000 
rain was going through upside down

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.089 
rain was going through upside down
stairs<00:06:17.449> if<00:06:18.020> you<00:06:18.229> had<00:06:18.349> them<00:06:18.529> in<00:06:18.560> your<00:06:18.650> base<00:06:18.860> you

00:06:19.089 --> 00:06:19.099 
stairs if you had them in your base you

00:06:19.099 --> 00:06:20.769 
stairs if you had them in your base you
would<00:06:19.159> get<00:06:19.340> like<00:06:19.520> rain<00:06:19.789> pouring<00:06:20.180> through<00:06:20.569> if

00:06:20.769 --> 00:06:20.779 
would get like rain pouring through if

00:06:20.779 --> 00:06:22.779 
would get like rain pouring through if
you<00:06:21.199> slept<00:06:21.500> in<00:06:21.620> a<00:06:21.680> bed<00:06:21.830> near<00:06:22.129> a<00:06:22.159> transparent

00:06:22.779 --> 00:06:22.789 
you slept in a bed near a transparent

00:06:22.789 --> 00:06:24.550 
you slept in a bed near a transparent
block<00:06:22.940> like<00:06:23.150> a<00:06:23.270> leaf<00:06:23.659> block<00:06:23.930> or<00:06:24.139> like<00:06:24.289> glass

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:24.560 
block like a leaf block or like glass

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:26.559 
block like a leaf block or like glass
you<00:06:25.069> accidentally<00:06:25.610> go<00:06:25.789> inside<00:06:26.210> of<00:06:26.240> it<00:06:26.419> and

00:06:26.559 --> 00:06:26.569 
you accidentally go inside of it and

00:06:26.569 --> 00:06:28.089 
you accidentally go inside of it and
some<00:06:26.719> things<00:06:26.900> you<00:06:27.020> could<00:06:27.139> suffocate<00:06:27.529> in<00:06:27.860> if

00:06:28.089 --> 00:06:28.099 
some things you could suffocate in if

00:06:28.099 --> 00:06:29.890 
some things you could suffocate in if
you<00:06:28.279> uh<00:06:28.310> if<00:06:28.669> you<00:06:29.000> woke<00:06:29.240> up<00:06:29.449> and<00:06:29.659> you<00:06:29.750> would<00:06:29.870> just

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:29.900 
you uh if you woke up and you would just

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:32.320 
you uh if you woke up and you would just
pop<00:06:30.139> into<00:06:30.500> that<00:06:30.680> block<00:06:30.919> double<00:06:31.729> slabs<00:06:32.029> have

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:32.330 
pop into that block double slabs have

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:34.060 
pop into that block double slabs have
that<00:06:32.479> really<00:06:32.690> cool<00:06:32.870> seamless<00:06:33.440> look<00:06:33.710> but<00:06:33.919> that

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:34.070 
that really cool seamless look but that

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:36.129 
that really cool seamless look but that
was<00:06:34.219> a<00:06:34.250> bug<00:06:34.490> so<00:06:35.029> we<00:06:35.149> can't<00:06:35.360> stack<00:06:35.630> two<00:06:35.839> double

00:06:36.129 --> 00:06:36.139 
was a bug so we can't stack two double

00:06:36.139 --> 00:06:38.540 
was a bug so we can't stack two double
slabs<00:06:36.409> to<00:06:36.710> make<00:06:36.889> like<00:06:37.070> a<00:06:37.219> us<00:06:37.520> you<00:06:38.210> know

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:38.550 
slabs to make like a us you know

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:40.070 
slabs to make like a us you know
seamless<00:06:38.850> block<00:06:39.150> there<00:06:39.480> that<00:06:39.690> we've<00:06:39.810> gotten

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:40.080 
seamless block there that we've gotten

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:42.440 
seamless block there that we've gotten
another<00:06:40.290> updates<00:06:40.770> and<00:06:40.980> then<00:06:41.460> finally<00:06:41.970> item

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:42.450 
another updates and then finally item

00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:44.330 
another updates and then finally item
frames<00:06:42.690> were<00:06:42.870> using<00:06:43.140> the<00:06:43.260> oak<00:06:43.470> texture<00:06:44.040> on<00:06:44.220> the

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:44.340 
frames were using the oak texture on the

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:45.620 
frames were using the oak texture on the
side<00:06:44.490> but<00:06:44.640> they're<00:06:44.790> now<00:06:44.940> using<00:06:44.970> the<00:06:45.390> birch

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:45.630 
side but they're now using the birch

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:47.560 
side but they're now using the birch
texture<00:06:46.140> again<00:06:46.260> so<00:06:46.620> they<00:06:46.740> look<00:06:46.920> more<00:06:47.370> normal

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:47.570 
texture again so they look more normal

00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:49.940 
texture again so they look more normal
but<00:06:48.570> that<00:06:48.600> is<00:06:48.840> pretty<00:06:48.990> much<00:06:49.170> it<00:06:49.230> like<00:06:49.590> I<00:06:49.710> said

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:49.950 
but that is pretty much it like I said

00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:51.920 
but that is pretty much it like I said
lots<00:06:50.430> optimizations<00:06:51.180> now<00:06:51.330> we're<00:06:51.570> gonna<00:06:51.660> get<00:06:51.900> a

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:51.930 
lots optimizations now we're gonna get a

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:53.960 
lots optimizations now we're gonna get a
lot<00:06:52.170> of<00:06:52.320> you<00:06:52.770> know<00:06:52.800> tweaking<00:06:53.400> to<00:06:53.580> the<00:06:53.670> features

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:53.970 
lot of you know tweaking to the features

00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:55.760 
lot of you know tweaking to the features
that<00:06:54.000> are<00:06:54.240> already<00:06:54.420> existing<00:06:54.960> in<00:06:55.080> the<00:06:55.500> coming

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:55.770 
that are already existing in the coming

00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:58.130 
that are already existing in the coming
weeks<00:06:55.950> and<00:06:56.160> hopefully<00:06:56.310> we<00:06:57.090> will<00:06:57.120> have<00:06:57.300> 1.8<00:06:58.020> by

00:06:58.130 --> 00:06:58.140 
weeks and hopefully we will have 1.8 by

00:06:58.140 --> 00:06:59.780 
weeks and hopefully we will have 1.8 by
the<00:06:58.200> end<00:06:58.410> of<00:06:58.530> the<00:06:58.650> summer<00:06:58.890> thank<00:06:59.340> you<00:06:59.460> guys<00:06:59.610> for
