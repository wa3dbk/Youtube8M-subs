00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:09.559 
exciting to think about you know working
with<00:04:07.889> Kobe<00:04:08.340> again<00:04:08.549> and<00:04:08.700> working<00:04:08.940> alongside<00:04:09.209> of

00:04:09.559 --> 00:04:09.569 
with Kobe again and working alongside of

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:11.659 
with Kobe again and working alongside of
him<00:04:09.690> and<00:04:09.930> and<00:04:10.079> all<00:04:10.709> of<00:04:10.859> the<00:04:10.980> guys<00:04:11.160> on<00:04:11.400> the<00:04:11.489> team

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:11.669 
him and and all of the guys on the team

00:04:11.669 --> 00:04:14.150 
him and and all of the guys on the team
I<00:04:12.169> think<00:04:13.169> this<00:04:13.319> team<00:04:13.530> in<00:04:13.709> the<00:04:13.769> last<00:04:13.980> couple

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:14.160 
I think this team in the last couple

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:17.300 
I think this team in the last couple
years<00:04:14.310> even<00:04:14.669> though<00:04:15.889> doesn't<00:04:16.889> maybe<00:04:16.979> feel

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310 
years even though doesn't maybe feel

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:19.460 
years even though doesn't maybe feel
that<00:04:17.549> way<00:04:17.700> obviously<00:04:18.269> for<00:04:18.690> mentioned<00:04:19.410> the

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:19.470 
that way obviously for mentioned the

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:21.529 
that way obviously for mentioned the
guys<00:04:19.650> that<00:04:19.799> have<00:04:19.919> been<00:04:20.039> here<00:04:20.099> because<00:04:20.639> of<00:04:20.820> you

00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:21.539 
guys that have been here because of you

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:24.350 
guys that have been here because of you
know<00:04:22.109> spoiling<00:04:22.979> themselves<00:04:23.370> in<00:04:23.820> ourselves<00:04:23.940> in

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360 
know spoiling themselves in ourselves in

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:25.580 
know spoiling themselves in ourselves in
the<00:04:24.419> past<00:04:24.659> with<00:04:24.870> winning<00:04:25.020> championships

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:25.590 
the past with winning championships

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:27.580 
the past with winning championships
doesn't<00:04:26.460> seem<00:04:26.580> like<00:04:26.640> there's<00:04:26.969> been<00:04:27.090> a

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:27.590
