alright here we have a situation where

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:18.370 
alright here we have a situation where
we're<00:00:17.270> going<00:00:17.390> to<00:00:17.480> be<00:00:17.570> removing<00:00:17.900> some<00:00:18.020> dead

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:18.380 
we're going to be removing some dead

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:20.890 
we're going to be removing some dead
limbs<00:00:18.680> in<00:00:18.950> a<00:00:19.430> live<00:00:19.700> tree<00:00:20.119> that<00:00:20.390> we<00:00:20.480> don't<00:00:20.720> want

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:20.900 
limbs in a live tree that we don't want

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:22.930 
limbs in a live tree that we don't want
to<00:00:21.020> remove<00:00:21.290> I've<00:00:22.220> got<00:00:22.400> a<00:00:22.430> couple<00:00:22.640> of<00:00:22.790> dead

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:22.940 
to remove I've got a couple of dead

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:24.519 
to remove I've got a couple of dead
limbs<00:00:23.150> up<00:00:23.330> here<00:00:23.480> in<00:00:23.570> the<00:00:23.660> middle<00:00:23.930> area<00:00:24.200> of<00:00:24.439> the

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:24.529 
limbs up here in the middle area of the

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:26.380 
limbs up here in the middle area of the
tree<00:00:24.770> but<00:00:25.130> I've<00:00:25.250> got<00:00:25.430> some<00:00:25.640> live<00:00:25.850> material

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:26.390 
tree but I've got some live material

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:28.360 
tree but I've got some live material
below<00:00:26.630> me<00:00:26.840> so<00:00:27.260> I<00:00:27.290> don't<00:00:27.440> want<00:00:27.770> to<00:00:27.860> lower<00:00:28.100> these

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:28.370 
below me so I don't want to lower these

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:30.760 
below me so I don't want to lower these
limbs<00:00:28.670> down<00:00:28.910> and<00:00:29.180> possibly<00:00:29.630> damage<00:00:30.110> the<00:00:30.380> limbs

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:30.770 
limbs down and possibly damage the limbs

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:33.310 
limbs down and possibly damage the limbs
below<00:00:31.190> what<00:00:32.059> we've<00:00:32.239> done<00:00:32.450> is<00:00:32.690> we're<00:00:33.110> going<00:00:33.230> to

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:33.320 
below what we've done is we're going to

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.250 
below what we've done is we're going to
set<00:00:33.620> up<00:00:33.770> two<00:00:34.160> rigging<00:00:35.000> points<00:00:35.449> I've<00:00:35.570> set<00:00:36.050> up<00:00:36.080> a

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:36.260 
set up two rigging points I've set up a

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.260 
set up two rigging points I've set up a
rigging<00:00:36.530> point<00:00:36.770> overhead<00:00:37.309> above<00:00:37.670> me<00:00:37.850> in<00:00:38.030> this

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:38.270 
rigging point overhead above me in this

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:40.780 
rigging point overhead above me in this
tree<00:00:38.540> and<00:00:38.750> we've<00:00:39.470> set<00:00:39.739> up<00:00:39.770> a<00:00:39.980> rigging<00:00:40.370> point<00:00:40.610> in

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:40.790 
tree and we've set up a rigging point in

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:43.660 
tree and we've set up a rigging point in
a<00:00:41.030> tree<00:00:41.300> adjacent<00:00:42.050> to<00:00:42.199> us<00:00:42.280> because<00:00:43.280> we<00:00:43.489> have<00:00:43.640> a

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:43.670 
a tree adjacent to us because we have a

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:47.200 
a tree adjacent to us because we have a
nice<00:00:43.940> open<00:00:44.230> landing<00:00:45.230> area<00:00:45.530> below<00:00:45.949> it<00:00:46.220> the

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:47.210 
nice open landing area below it the

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:49.540 
nice open landing area below it the
concept<00:00:47.780> here<00:00:47.960> is<00:00:48.019> known<00:00:48.350> as<00:00:48.530> drip<00:00:48.920> lining<00:00:49.400> or

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:49.550 
concept here is known as drip lining or

concept here is known as drip lining or
a<00:00:49.790> transfer<00:00:50.540> line<00:00:50.750> some<00:00:51.080> people<00:00:51.379> call<00:00:51.589> it<00:00:51.620> what

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:52.400 
a transfer line some people call it what

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:53.890 
a transfer line some people call it what
I'm<00:00:52.489> going<00:00:52.699> to<00:00:52.729> do<00:00:52.879> in<00:00:53.000> this<00:00:53.120> situation<00:00:53.750> with

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:53.900 
I'm going to do in this situation with

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:56.110 
I'm going to do in this situation with
this<00:00:54.050> first<00:00:54.290> limb<00:00:54.620> is<00:00:54.890> I'm<00:00:55.129> going<00:00:55.580> to<00:00:55.729> take<00:00:55.940> the

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:56.120 
this first limb is I'm going to take the

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.299 
this first limb is I'm going to take the
blue<00:00:56.390> lowering<00:00:57.140> line<00:00:57.350> which<00:00:57.620> is<00:00:57.769> in<00:00:57.800> the<00:00:57.979> other

00:00:58.299 --> 00:00:58.309 
blue lowering line which is in the other

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:01.060 
blue lowering line which is in the other
tree<00:00:58.729> and<00:00:58.970> tie<00:00:59.720> it<00:00:59.780> off<00:00:59.989> near<00:01:00.320> the<00:01:00.350> tip<00:01:00.710> of<00:01:00.949> the

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:01.070 
tree and tie it off near the tip of the

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:03.670 
tree and tie it off near the tip of the
limb<00:01:01.280> then<00:01:01.940> I'll<00:01:02.089> take<00:01:02.360> this<00:01:02.570> yellow<00:01:03.080> lowering

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:03.680 
limb then I'll take this yellow lowering

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:05.740 
limb then I'll take this yellow lowering
line<00:01:03.860> and<00:01:04.100> tie<00:01:04.519> it<00:01:04.580> off<00:01:04.729> here<00:01:05.150> near<00:01:05.360> the<00:01:05.540> butt

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:05.750 
line and tie it off here near the butt

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.010 
line and tie it off here near the butt
end<00:01:06.430> then<00:01:07.430> as<00:01:07.580> I<00:01:07.670> get<00:01:07.729> positioned<00:01:08.420> to<00:01:08.659> make<00:01:08.780> my

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:09.020 
end then as I get positioned to make my

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:10.960 
end then as I get positioned to make my
cut<00:01:09.320> I'll<00:01:09.890> want<00:01:10.159> to<00:01:10.220> coordinate<00:01:10.520> with<00:01:10.850> my

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:10.970 
cut I'll want to coordinate with my

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:12.880 
cut I'll want to coordinate with my
ground<00:01:11.240> workers<00:01:11.630> in<00:01:11.870> a<00:01:12.110> situation<00:01:12.650> like<00:01:12.680> this

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:12.890 
ground workers in a situation like this

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:15.609 
ground workers in a situation like this
having<00:01:13.430> multiple<00:01:13.909> workers<00:01:14.450> in<00:01:15.110> the<00:01:15.259> lowering

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:15.619 
having multiple workers in the lowering

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:18.100 
having multiple workers in the lowering
process<00:01:16.130> coordination<00:01:16.909> is<00:01:17.030> very<00:01:17.090> important<00:01:17.899> I

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:18.110 
process coordination is very important I

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:20.170 
process coordination is very important I
want<00:01:18.619> to<00:01:18.890> make<00:01:19.009> sure<00:01:19.039> that<00:01:19.280> they<00:01:19.430> both<00:01:19.640> tension

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:20.180 
want to make sure that they both tension

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:24.039 
want to make sure that they both tension
up<00:01:20.479> their<00:01:20.659> lines<00:01:20.930> and<00:01:21.740> then<00:01:22.460> as<00:01:22.700> I<00:01:23.689> make<00:01:23.899> the

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:24.049 
up their lines and then as I make the

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:26.709 
up their lines and then as I make the
cut<00:01:24.289> and<00:01:24.530> we<00:01:25.399> start<00:01:25.700> lowering<00:01:26.119> the<00:01:26.240> limb<00:01:26.450> the

00:01:26.709 --> 00:01:26.719 
cut and we start lowering the limb the

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:29.200 
cut and we start lowering the limb the
concept<00:01:27.289> is<00:01:27.469> that<00:01:27.500> we<00:01:27.710> will<00:01:28.009> drift<00:01:28.729> the<00:01:29.000> piece

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:29.210 
concept is that we will drift the piece

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:32.679 
concept is that we will drift the piece
across<00:01:30.280> transferring<00:01:31.280> the<00:01:31.579> load<00:01:31.689> primarily

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:32.689 
across transferring the load primarily

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:34.630 
across transferring the load primarily
from<00:01:32.960> the<00:01:33.109> yellow<00:01:33.320> line<00:01:33.619> over<00:01:34.159> to<00:01:34.189> the<00:01:34.340> blue

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:34.640 
from the yellow line over to the blue

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.249 
from the yellow line over to the blue
line<00:01:34.670> so<00:01:35.210> that<00:01:35.359> we<00:01:35.450> can<00:01:35.600> move<00:01:35.750> it<00:01:35.930> into<00:01:36.049> that

00:01:36.249 --> 00:01:36.259 
line so that we can move it into that

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:39.039 
line so that we can move it into that
nice<00:01:36.530> open<00:01:36.850> landing<00:01:37.850> area<00:01:38.179> underneath<00:01:38.570> this

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:39.049 
nice open landing area underneath this

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:41.950 
nice open landing area underneath this
adjacent<00:01:39.380> tree<00:01:40.210> now<00:01:41.210> I'm<00:01:41.329> going<00:01:41.479> to<00:01:41.539> tie<00:01:41.750> off

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:41.960 
adjacent tree now I'm going to tie off

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:48.020 
adjacent tree now I'm going to tie off
the<00:01:42.530> limbs

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.820 

I'm<00:01:49.030> going<00:01:49.180> to<00:01:49.240> be<00:01:49.360> tying<00:01:49.630> this<00:01:49.870> off<00:01:50.110> with<00:01:50.800> a

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:50.830 
I'm going to be tying this off with a

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:54.900 
I'm going to be tying this off with a
clove<00:01:51.160> hitch<00:01:51.480> and<00:01:52.480> backing<00:01:53.350> it<00:01:53.470> up<00:01:53.700> with<00:01:54.700> a

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:54.910 
clove hitch and backing it up with a

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:57.390 
clove hitch and backing it up with a
couple<00:01:55.300> of<00:01:55.450> half<00:01:55.690> hitches<00:01:56.010> clove<00:01:57.010> hitch<00:01:57.160> is<00:01:57.190> a

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:57.400 
couple of half hitches clove hitch is a

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:58.320 
couple of half hitches clove hitch is a
rolling<00:01:57.910> hitch

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:58.330 
rolling hitch

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:00.450 
rolling hitch
so<00:01:58.840> the<00:01:58.960> half<00:01:59.140> hitches<00:01:59.380> will<00:02:00.010> prevent<00:02:00.280> it<00:02:00.430> from

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:00.460 
so the half hitches will prevent it from

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:08.450 
so the half hitches will prevent it from
rolling<00:02:00.790> out<00:02:01.650> okay<00:02:02.670> tied<00:02:03.670> dressed<00:02:04.030> and<00:02:04.240> set

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:08.460 

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:14.670 

and<00:02:09.460> now<00:02:09.670> we'll<00:02:09.880> move<00:02:10.060> down<00:02:10.330> and<00:02:11.260> tie<00:02:12.190> off<00:02:13.680> the

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
and now we'll move down and tie off the
