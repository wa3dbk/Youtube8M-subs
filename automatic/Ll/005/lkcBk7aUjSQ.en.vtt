 ceku my whole hair do not brush 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:48.270
 nothing just blinds the hair and in the heat 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.930
 People look like I was sweating there I 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.400
 I'm very hot. 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:54.690
 Serious people dries their hair in this heat. 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.189
 no one deserves it right 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:58.229
 then I also do me baby I've liss 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:00.090
 I showed you the drinks in the video. 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:02.310
 who did a review of it I have loved 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.750
 so when the date is so special 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.670
 When I'm going to record a video I love doing 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.340
 babyliss I've been leaving lately 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.379
 my smoothest hair but I love babyliss 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:13.849
 There's no way I think it gets super cute. 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:13.849
 know to give more volume in the hair 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:24.790
 love asks the glove for me 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:32.700
 doing a great favor that I 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:32.700
 I created my finger again in the drawer 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:47.080
 You saw me overprotective sent the 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:48.820
 rooster came then I'll use it in the field 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:50.350
 since my hand twice 

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:52.810
 I like to knead the bunches later 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:55.120
 so come the comb to March to let the 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:58.030
 look very natural so you know a 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:59.470
 waves so natural step also look at the 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.940
 even the line that I said at the beginning only 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:02.280
 to take the cold to brighten 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:05.410
 of hair 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:07.510
 I love this curly look. 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:09.730
 now I come with primer to hold the 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:11.890
 whole makeup to try it right 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:14.140
 the pores to the base looks more beautiful in the 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:15.790
 face 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:18.250
 So I come with the base I do not like 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:20.050
 From this base people is this base she has a 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:22.510
 very strong smell her coverage is 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:24.580
 but it is the only basis that is 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:27.130
 serving in the courage for me knows by 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:29.110
 whole body more tan and this base 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:31.120
 is the only one that is equaling more or 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:33.970
 less then but the smell of it is very 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:36.100
 so it tastes very strong and it does not 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:38.200
 comes with a squad that I put now 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:40.269
 comes with this wonderful concealer from 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:42.519
 analysis and my sister that honey is over 

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:45.430
 I 'm using it but people look at it. 

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:47.500
 coverage of this serious collective list 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:50.320
 cover everything she smiles under the eyes 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:53.530
 Horrible Logical Do not Get Perfected 

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:55.480
 but look what was going on is very good tone 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:57.580
 serious collective reports 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:59.590
 Then I pass the base of daniela shadows. 

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:01.570
 has skin color so in base color 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:04.299
 so the lid looks all over that little face and 

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:06.970
 Eyelid I like a lot and I always 

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:09.100
 use her in this daniks shadow base 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:11.320
 come with the powder to settle the 

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:13.810
 concealer to seat base and become a 

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:16.330
 more beautiful finish on the skin then I 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:18.400
 I love this mac too now fix it 

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:20.799
 the eyebrow I love eyebrow 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:22.270
 Thick I think it's very handsome 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:24.099
 of course I do not have to 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:25.750
 thick eyebrow I can not exaggerate 

00:04:24.099 --> 00:04:28.530
 So I'm very stressed but I always 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:28.530
 correct my eyebrow 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:34.930
 Then I come with this shadow of the 

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:37.000
 goal and passes through the 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:38.949
 my mobile eyelid in the brush was 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.650
 dirty with a shining shine then 

00:04:38.949 --> 00:04:44.440
 ended up getting this mixture there but it's not 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:47.250
 know what gloss shadow was our 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:51.550
 shadow means Roxinha calls hawks roccella 

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:53.470
 the concave and step it in the hollow that 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:55.509
 leave an air more like that cidinho 

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:57.220
 Seeing with the field, it's kind of red. 

00:04:55.509 --> 00:05:00.250
 It was very cute and I like it a lot 

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:03.220
 From this shadow and I love room in the concave 

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:05.770
 I come with the venus illuminating shadow only 

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:07.510
 to leave the subtle air nothing too strong 

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:10.300
 now I take this shadow of the said 

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:12.520
 berenice and merge so it passes over 

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:14.169
 where I went to another red one just to 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:16.330
 without breaking the bank to get a 

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:18.460
 more beautiful finish and now 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:20.410
 eyeliner kitten I think 

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:22.419
 eyeliner in pen is much more 

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:24.639
 then if you have difficulty 

00:05:22.419 --> 00:05:26.470
 You will adapt much more with pen 

00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:28.120
 and then I make the eyeliner 

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:30.639
 I always end up exaggerating, I'll say 

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:33.099
 make fininho more delicate always 

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:36.010
 ends up getting thick but will get on 

00:05:33.099 --> 00:05:39.010
 Serrano practice has no way and there 

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:41.669
 as you are doing every day one 

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:43.930
 time will be cool 

00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:46.389
 now comes with this lapse that I won 

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:48.580
 Danane is very very good is good 

00:05:46.389 --> 00:05:51.039
 Pigmented looks like it slides right into the 

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:53.949
 eye knows it is very soft even so the 

00:05:51.039 --> 00:05:57.729
 word is very soft and it proof 

00:05:53.949 --> 00:05:59.830
 Also , I'm sorry for what's coming 

00:05:57.729 --> 00:06:02.409
 with this essence mask 

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:04.240
 I mix it up with that of the cover of the 

00:06:02.409 --> 00:06:05.770
 I have loved this first dupline 

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:09.849
 I come with the essence that gives a super 

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:11.889
 abiente volume of runoff and quite 

00:06:09.849 --> 00:06:14.530
 then after running or swimming a separate 

00:06:11.889 --> 00:06:17.470
 in a long time I like a lot and have 

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:19.870
 very used that mac luxury the harmony and 

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:23.260
 he gives symptoms in a little brownie knows 

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:25.120
 I love tan and illuminator 

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:26.710
 also letting affect bronzes 

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:29.680
 impasse with the same brush even has 

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:32.289
 button issue chose the hang loose 

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:35.560
 of mac that is an orange like that of 

00:06:32.289 --> 00:06:37.270
 oranges and more 

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:39.370
 very discreet signal makeup had well 

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:42.610
 the birthday and the makeup that I 

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:44.710

 application that has it looks like a necklace and 

00:06:47.139 --> 00:06:52.599
 I really liked this combination. 

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:54.009
 I put on with a short skirt is black and 

00:06:52.599 --> 00:06:55.509
 I thought it was really cool this shirt that 

00:06:54.009 --> 00:06:57.129
 has chess back in a pack of 

00:06:55.509 --> 00:06:58.840
 life favorites I've loved 

00:06:57.129 --> 00:07:01.780
 This oxy that my mother gave me to 

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:03.879
 little screen and that's what people chose a look 

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:06.009
 very simple in one because I only went 

00:07:03.879 --> 00:07:08.500
 have lunch with my parents 

00:07:06.009 --> 00:07:10.090
 the rappa was also the one went to eat 

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:13.030
 even in the mall is not public that 

00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:15.189
