then<00:03:03.060> discard<00:03:03.480> it<00:03:03.600> at<00:03:03.720> then<00:03:03.840> turn<00:03:05.120> so<00:03:06.120> we<00:03:06.240> can

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
then discard it at then turn so we can

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:07.460 
then discard it at then turn so we can
read<00:03:06.510> this<00:03:06.630> card<00:03:06.870> just<00:03:06.959> to<00:03:07.110> see<00:03:07.230> what<00:03:07.350> it's
