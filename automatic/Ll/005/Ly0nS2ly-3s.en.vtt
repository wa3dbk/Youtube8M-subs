00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:32.660 
needs me all nutrient dense so what

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:33.609 
needs me all nutrient dense so what
you're<00:01:32.750> going<00:01:32.869> to<00:01:32.930> need<00:01:33.110> to<00:01:33.259> do<00:01:33.320> is<00:01:33.410> you<00:01:33.530> need

small tummies and the other thing is

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:43.180 
small tummies and the other thing is
that<00:01:41.600> although<00:01:42.200> this<00:01:42.440> is<00:01:42.500> really<00:01:42.950> high<00:01:43.159> in

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:43.190 
that although this is really high in

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:45.190 
that although this is really high in
iron<00:01:43.490> quite<00:01:44.270> difficult<00:01:44.450> for<00:01:44.750> our<00:01:44.810> bodies<00:01:45.080> to

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:45.200 
iron quite difficult for our bodies to

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.560 
iron quite difficult for our bodies to
absorb<00:01:45.590> it's<00:01:45.920> not<00:01:46.040> like<00:01:46.190> meat<00:01:46.430> so<00:01:47.149> in<00:01:47.240> order<00:01:47.360> to

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:47.570 
absorb it's not like meat so in order to

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:49.029 
absorb it's not like meat so in order to
boost<00:01:47.960> the<00:01:48.110> iron<00:01:48.229> absorption<00:01:48.350> on<00:01:48.770> something

00:01:49.029 --> 00:01:49.039 
boost the iron absorption on something

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:50.980 
boost the iron absorption on something
like<00:01:49.130> lentils<00:01:49.580> music<00:01:50.420> give<00:01:50.509> your<00:01:50.630> baby<00:01:50.720> some

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:52.940 
vitamin C at the same meal so maybe a

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:55.630 
vitamin C at the same meal so maybe a
diluted<00:01:53.420> fruit<00:01:53.660> juice<00:01:53.869> which<00:01:54.200> a<00:01:54.320> vitamin<00:01:54.680> C<00:01:54.890> or

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640 
diluted fruit juice which a vitamin C or

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.460 
diluted fruit juice which a vitamin C or
it<00:01:55.789> could<00:01:55.970> be<00:01:56.149> something<00:01:56.509> like<00:01:56.990> some

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:57.470 
it could be something like some

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:00.040 
it could be something like some
