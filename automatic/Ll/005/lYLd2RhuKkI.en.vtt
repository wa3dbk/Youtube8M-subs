00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:27.120
 family what happened to the family in the 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:30.090
 Pedro party 

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:32.480
 there was a problem at halftime there 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.480
 hear 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:36.580
 there was a problem at halftime 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:40.600
 matches when the first half ended 

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:43.010
 of the messi team friendly match 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:45.320
 with the neymar team 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:48.109
 many people in the countryside a lot of people 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:50.120
 entered with a picture with messi for a 

00:00:48.109 --> 00:00:52.120
 interview with messi and got armed 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.859
 truly a mess 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:57.589
 quite complicated to handle when 

00:00:54.859 --> 00:01:01.820
 started the second time he wanted to ask 

00:00:57.589 --> 00:01:04.640
 a rearrangement against as of location of 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:08.090
 the photographers the journalists and also 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:10.310
 were the guests of Messi and 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:11.810
 some players were not the 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:14.390
 Messi brothers we all know that 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:17.569
 Messi travels on all his tours 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:20.899
 Rodrigo and MatÃ­as Messi were not 

00:01:17.569 --> 00:01:23.690
 them in the field and they were located 

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:25.960
 near the substitute bench where 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:28.549
 there was the well-known technician fabio capello 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:32.110
 as far as we have found fabio 

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:35.209
 capello asks for a relocation of location 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:37.459
 of these people asks to take them in the 

00:01:35.209 --> 00:01:39.380
 tribune of why they have to 

00:01:37.459 --> 00:01:40.820
 be more comfortable was not a request for 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:43.850
 capello 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:45.800
 of voting the people capello knew that 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:48.080
 family players were only 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:50.810
 He asked us to see how they see us but for a 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:52.580
 topic I suppose that of language or by 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:55.760
 how do you speak you know the 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:58.040
 Italians with a very talkative to 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:59.840
 talking to the policemen misunderstood 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:01.610
 the police understood that they take them out 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:06.490
 they took out 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:10.429
 so let's say badly 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:13.940
 with pushes and becomes more and when 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:16.970
 lionel finds out about the incident asks for his 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:18.320
 change and after the stadium there 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:19.880
 he understands that they have mistreated the 

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:21.860
 family that was sitting and not area of 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.750
 bench that has lost accommodate that 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:26.630
 people to the grandstand who are more comfortable 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.890
 more and understand me yes that what they have done 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:29.630
 the organization what it has done has been 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:31.490
 mistreating your family now that 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:32.480
 evicted badly from the area 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:35.660
 of benches next to the bench 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:37.430
 of is own the teams themselves 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:39.230
 that is the anger that it provokes in month and 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:41.540
 who decides to leave the correct field 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:45.880
 pedro e 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:51.820
 if it was understood 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:54.760
 and asked for a rearrangement of people yes but 

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:56.440
 the police said it was okay it was what 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:00.090
 Right 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:00.090
 yes perfectly but 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:08.020
 perfect 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:11.920
 I played in Lima yesterday exactly 75 

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:14.950
 right correct minutes was changed 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:17.460
 he was changed and he said goodbye to the people 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:21.310
 as applause I test any incident 

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:26.350
 the whole field is what we have created 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:28.660
 this month and then travels to the hotel without 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:32.290
 even to this change of the clothes of the 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:34.120
 match and that indicates that I was quite 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:36.160
 annoyed by what had happened in 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:38.080
 the halftime when relatives 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:39.400
