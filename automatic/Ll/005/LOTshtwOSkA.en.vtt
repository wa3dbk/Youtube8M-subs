00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:20.740 
I'm probably impossible or just a very
bad<00:03:18.860> idea<00:03:19.100> without<00:03:19.460> a<00:03:19.670> full-on<00:03:20.030> support<00:03:20.480> crew

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:20.750 
bad idea without a full-on support crew

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:22.570 
bad idea without a full-on support crew
and<00:03:21.410> that's<00:03:21.740> when<00:03:21.920> you're<00:03:22.010> gonna<00:03:22.130> take<00:03:22.310> a<00:03:22.340> step

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:22.580 
and that's when you're gonna take a step

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:26.320 
and that's when you're gonna take a step
back<00:03:22.760> and<00:03:22.940> say<00:03:23.210> okay<00:03:23.570> what<00:03:24.490> sections<00:03:25.490> are

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:26.330 
back and say okay what sections are

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:30.010 
back and say okay what sections are
doable<00:03:26.630> and<00:03:27.380> what<00:03:27.590> sections<00:03:28.180> I'm<00:03:29.180> not<00:03:29.390> wise<00:03:29.990> to

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:30.020 
doable and what sections I'm not wise to

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:32.800 
doable and what sections I'm not wise to
do<00:03:30.470> in<00:03:30.950> the<00:03:31.130> essence<00:03:31.490> of<00:03:31.610> adventure<00:03:32.060> you<00:03:32.360> can't

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:32.810 
do in the essence of adventure you can't

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:35.350 
do in the essence of adventure you can't
be<00:03:32.960> set<00:03:33.230> on<00:03:33.260> any<00:03:33.800> one<00:03:34.010> plan<00:03:34.340> you<00:03:34.820> really<00:03:35.180> have

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:35.360 
be set on any one plan you really have

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:39.340 
be set on any one plan you really have
to<00:03:35.630> sort<00:03:36.410> of<00:03:36.500> be<00:03:36.680> able<00:03:37.040> to<00:03:37.310> bend<00:03:38.300> and<00:03:38.690> go<00:03:38.960> with

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:39.350 
to sort of be able to bend and go with

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:42.010 
to sort of be able to bend and go with
the<00:03:39.500> wind<00:03:39.710> and<00:03:39.950> the<00:03:40.040> tides<00:03:40.310> and<00:03:40.640> and<00:03:40.900> you<00:03:41.900> know

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:42.020 
the wind and the tides and and you know

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:44.980 
the wind and the tides and and you know
and<00:03:42.230> adjust<00:03:42.920> the<00:03:43.070> plan<00:03:43.280> accordingly<00:03:43.850> as<00:03:44.180> new

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:44.990 
and adjust the plan accordingly as new

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:49.590 
and adjust the plan accordingly as new
information<00:03:45.170> and<00:03:45.770> new<00:03:45.920> things<00:03:46.220> come<00:03:46.520> up

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:49.600 

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:51.730 

figuring<00:03:50.600> out<00:03:50.690> how<00:03:50.840> to<00:03:50.870> get<00:03:51.140> all<00:03:51.260> the<00:03:51.440> gear

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:51.740 
figuring out how to get all the gear

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:53.680 
figuring out how to get all the gear
food<00:03:52.100> and<00:03:52.370> water<00:03:52.520> onto<00:03:52.880> the<00:03:53.120> boards<00:03:53.480> was

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:53.690 
food and water onto the boards was

00:03:53.690 --> 00:04:10.860 
food and water onto the boards was
definitely<00:03:54.290> no<00:03:54.530> small<00:03:54.860> task

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:10.870 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:12.150 

getting<00:04:11.440> out<00:04:11.560> there<00:04:11.590> the<00:04:11.860> other<00:04:11.980> morning

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:12.160 
getting out there the other morning

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:13.979 
getting out there the other morning
really<00:04:12.430> early<00:04:12.519> we<00:04:13.120> put<00:04:13.569> the<00:04:13.629> board's<00:04:13.870> in<00:04:13.930> the

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:13.989 
really early we put the board's in the

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:15.509 
really early we put the board's in the
water<00:04:14.140> for<00:04:14.260> the<00:04:14.319> first<00:04:14.530> time<00:04:14.830> fully<00:04:15.250> loaded

00:04:15.509 --> 00:04:15.519 
water for the first time fully loaded

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:17.939 
water for the first time fully loaded
and<00:04:15.849> this<00:04:16.449> was<00:04:16.600> basically<00:04:16.930> like<00:04:17.109> a<00:04:17.169> test<00:04:17.709> run

00:04:17.939 --> 00:04:17.949 
and this was basically like a test run

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:20.009 
and this was basically like a test run
just<00:04:18.160> having<00:04:18.760> the<00:04:18.850> ocean<00:04:18.970> showing<00:04:19.630> us<00:04:19.780> it's

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:20.019 
just having the ocean showing us it's

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:27.360 
just having the ocean showing us it's
actually<00:04:20.169> what<00:04:20.440> we're<00:04:20.590> up<00:04:20.620> against<00:04:26.070> put<00:04:27.070> in<00:04:27.190> at

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:27.370 
actually what we're up against put in at

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:29.820 
actually what we're up against put in at
sunrise<00:04:27.760> and<00:04:28.180> did<00:04:28.479> a<00:04:28.510> 15-kilometer

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:29.830

we looked at a section probably about

00:04:45.509 --> 00:04:48.559 
we looked at a section probably about
400<00:04:46.500> kilometer<00:04:46.919> section<00:04:47.340> that<00:04:47.789> has<00:04:48.180> the<00:04:48.389> good
