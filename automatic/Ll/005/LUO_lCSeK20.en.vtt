00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:06.960
Are you tired of spending hours
cutting down trees?

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:11.040
Chopping away with only
blisters and cuts to show for it?

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:12.640
We have the solution.

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:16.960
We've looked at nature and developed
the ultimate tree feller.

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:21.120
Through years of evolution, the
beaver has perfected tree felling.

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:25.800
Through modern technology, we're
now introducing the brand new...

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.520
Beaver Axe! With the combination
beaver and axe handle,-

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:32.680
-you can fulfil
your tree felling potential.

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.600
With the Beaver Axe,
you get the best from both worlds.

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:41.880
The handle is beaver-felled birch.

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.040
The 40 millimetre long,
sharp beaver teeth-

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.160
-can cut through all sorts of trees.

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:52.040
Want to fell your neighbour's tree
that's ruining your view-

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:56.520
-but keep getting
noticed because of noisy tools?

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.280
Don't despair.
Finally there's a silent axe.

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.400
The Beaver Axe uses the same methods
as the beaver itself.

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.520
Quick and small beaver cuts
leave a perfectly rounded stump.

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:12.960
An untrained eye will immediately
think the beaver is responsible.

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.480
Say goodbye to poor excuses.

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.920
Finally you can blame beavers.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.680
Are you behind this?

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:23.080
No, but I think I saw
some beavers run down the street.

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.800
It could be a beaver attack.

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.920
Surely no one can be
angry at man's best friend?

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.040
Those damn beavers!

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:33.640
If that wasn't enough,-

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.880
-just listen to former national
football player Jostein Flo.

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:42.680
I'm Jostein Flo,
a former national football player.

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:45.200
I used a normal axe,
and my body had to pay.

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.960
Old sports injuries
returned with the axe.

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:52.320
A mate told me: "You can't
fell trees with a normal axe."

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.800
"What can I use then?"

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.760
He told me about
something called a Beaver Axe.

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.840
That has given me a new life,
and trees are falling everywhere.

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:09.520
This axe, the Beaver Axe, was what I
needed. I can fell trees everywhere.

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:15.560
The trees simply fall down. What a
product! It really clears the forest.

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.240
Trees are falling everywhere.
Fantastic product!

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:24.920

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.680

per minute, through all materials.

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.200
