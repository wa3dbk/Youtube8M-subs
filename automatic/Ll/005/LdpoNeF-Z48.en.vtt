00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.639
 what the Bible teaches about globalization in the final days of 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:15.149
 history of this world 

00:00:15.149 --> 00:00:17.339
 will this sacred book 

00:00:17.339 --> 00:00:19.089
 The word of God 

00:00:19.089 --> 00:00:23.890
 already had some prophetic orientations regarding globalization 

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:28.939
 What does the Bible teach us? 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:32.619
 apocalypse chapter 16 verse 13 says so 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:35.740
 and in the mouth of the dragon 

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:37.540
 in the mouth of the beast ' 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:39.810
 and from the mouth of the false prophet 

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:42.130
 I saw he left 3 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:45.520
 unclean spirits similar to chance 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:49.170
 because they are spirits of demons that operate signals 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.700
 who went to meet those who 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.660
 hi meeting whoever these three are going to 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.300
 to 13, given that Europe 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:04.920
 the remaining 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.770
 in South America 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:09.810
 to kings not before 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.360
 Worldwide 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.520
 for what 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.230
 the curumins stay the congregation 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.590
 dollarized 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:22.970
 for battle 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:25.970
 of the great almighty God's day 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.000
 therefore we know 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.100
 we who are 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.490
 christianity 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:36.630
 we understand that the end of globalization is what is 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:41.280
 battle 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.470
 the end the ultimate goal of globalization is a 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:49.130
 battle 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.250
 look how interesting 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.630
 for people out there globalization is something 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:58.410
 required 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:03.210
 because globalization is aimed at combating national differences 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.820
 break the borders 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:09.699
 and become the only people in the world 

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:12.889
 thus concentrating all the power 

00:02:12.889 --> 00:02:15.889
 globally speaking in just one world hand 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:22.040
 and that, of course, if it were possible, if it happened, it would end with the legs 

00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:26.679
 because it's from sandra de sÃ¡ enter there decentralizaria 

00:02:26.679 --> 00:02:28.149
 the powers 

00:02:28.149 --> 00:02:29.459
 nationalists 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:31.909
 that every nation has individually 

00:02:31.909 --> 00:02:36.299
 this would prevent such regional conflicts and take for example the United States 

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:37.979
 venezuela and smoking and 

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:40.979
 I'm alright 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:46.199
 the world would be more prostate would be better in the vision of the year 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:49.969
 if the world were to become one nation 

00:02:49.969 --> 00:02:54.049
 and countries like states stand out from the nation 

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:55.729
 a world capital 

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:58.229
 world's only single currency 

00:02:58.229 --> 00:03:00.409
 borderless 

00:03:00.409 --> 00:03:02.609
 no bureaucracies 

00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:05.609
 without the need for passports to go to the United States 

00:03:07.539 --> 00:03:09.189
 a world nation 

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:12.699
 this would end with many problems worldwide maniche 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:17.949
 then this is the vision out there of those who seek globalization 

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:22.059
 but the bible teaches us something else that this unification 

00:03:23.759 --> 00:03:27.099
 who is behind it are spirits and demons that is the 

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:28.099
 first 

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:29.880
 thing we understand in the text 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:31.329
 in second 

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:34.329
 which is for the assembled to a great battle 

00:03:35.369 --> 00:03:37.429
 team for this year 

00:03:37.429 --> 00:03:40.429
 we will understand in the course of the lectures 

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:44.129
 apocalypse 17 verse 12 says so 

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:47.439
 the disasters istres 

00:03:47.439 --> 00:03:48.909
 what did you see 

00:03:48.909 --> 00:03:50.899
 are beautiful 

00:03:50.899 --> 00:03:52.999
 kings 

00:03:52.999 --> 00:03:56.510
 who have not yet received the kingdom 

00:03:57.389 --> 00:04:01.489
 but will receive high humidity as kings for a 

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:05.839
 together with air 

00:04:05.839 --> 00:04:07.560
 and verse 3 to 17 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:10.069
 these have to say the 10 

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:12.489
 the outcomes of syphilis 

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:14.530
 have the same thinking 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:16.819
 the same goal 

00:04:16.819 --> 00:04:21.310
 and will surrender their power and authority to the 

00:04:22.599 --> 00:04:24.430
 the beast 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:27.639
 so the text we see said key 

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:29.029
 John saw 

00:04:29.029 --> 00:04:30.879
 10 x 3 

00:04:30.879 --> 00:04:32.460
 in the heads 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:34.639
 of the beast 

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:36.650
 and those to figure it out 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:39.219
 are they restoring the house 

00:04:39.219 --> 00:04:40.139
 gleisi 

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:43.189
 who will not yet receive 

00:04:43.189 --> 00:04:44.110
 power 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:46.129
 have not yet received 

00:04:46.129 --> 00:04:49.439
 but when they do, it will last for how long 

00:04:49.439 --> 00:04:52.520
 one hour this power 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:54.990
 and says so that these ten real 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:58.340
 in the same thought the same goal 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:01.020
 and when they receive it could 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:07.779
 they will deliver the power of their power into the hands of an 11th king 

00:05:07.779 --> 00:05:10.830
 the clue 

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:12.020
 keep well 

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:17.509
 the three kings will deliver his lamb to the screen to the 11th king 

00:05:18.039 --> 00:05:18.719
 and sight
