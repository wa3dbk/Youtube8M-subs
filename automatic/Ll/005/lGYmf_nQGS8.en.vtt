00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160 
your heels is totally okay it doesn't

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:38.830 
your heels is totally okay it doesn't
make<00:02:37.220> a<00:02:37.310> difference<00:02:37.490> they're<00:02:38.300> so<00:02:38.480> elastic

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840 
make a difference they're so elastic

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.340 
make a difference they're so elastic
like<00:02:39.680> look<00:02:39.860> at<00:02:39.920> this<00:02:40.210> so<00:02:41.210> elastic<00:02:41.510> it<00:02:41.930> just<00:02:42.140> it

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:42.350 
like look at this so elastic it just it

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:45.340 
like look at this so elastic it just it
just<00:02:42.410> wants<00:02:42.890> to<00:02:42.980> rebound<00:02:43.370> um<00:02:43.580> that<00:02:44.510> I<00:02:44.840> think

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:45.350 
just wants to rebound um that I think

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:48.190 
just wants to rebound um that I think
all<00:02:45.800> my<00:02:46.010> strides<00:02:46.370> it<00:02:46.580> and<00:02:46.790> isometric<00:02:47.660> jumps

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 
all my strides it and isometric jumps

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.010 
all my strides it and isometric jumps
probably<00:02:48.530> added<00:02:48.860> about<00:02:49.510> this<00:02:50.510> made<00:02:50.750> somewhere

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:51.020 
probably added about this made somewhere

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:53.470 
probably added about this made somewhere
around<00:02:51.140> two<00:02:51.440> to<00:02:51.560> three<00:02:51.800> feet<00:02:51.830> on<00:02:52.280> every<00:02:53.240> one<00:02:53.390> of

around two to three feet on every one of

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.750 
around two to three feet on every one of
those<00:02:53.570> jumps<00:02:53.960> the<00:02:54.830> amount<00:02:55.160> of<00:02:55.220> performance

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 
those jumps the amount of performance

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:57.370 
those jumps the amount of performance
boost<00:02:55.940> at<00:02:56.090> a<00:02:56.120> gaming<00:02:56.360> was<00:02:56.600> really<00:02:56.930> incredible

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:57.380 
boost at a gaming was really incredible

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:00.030 
boost at a gaming was really incredible
is<00:02:57.470> quite<00:02:57.770> an<00:02:57.980> upgrade<00:02:58.340> to<00:02:58.370> do<00:02:59.060> my<00:02:59.180> part<00:02:59.390> more

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040 
is quite an upgrade to do my part more

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:01.930 
is quite an upgrade to do my part more
flexibility<00:03:01.040> is<00:03:01.160> pretty<00:03:01.340> good<00:03:01.490> i<00:03:01.550> mean<00:03:01.760> it's

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:01.940 
flexibility is pretty good i mean it's

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:04.780 
flexibility is pretty good i mean it's
made<00:03:02.090> out<00:03:02.180> of<00:03:02.210> this<00:03:02.300> foam<00:03:02.540> stuff<00:03:02.840> has<00:03:03.790> doesn't

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790 
made out of this foam stuff has doesn't

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:06.550 
made out of this foam stuff has doesn't
take<00:03:04.910> too<00:03:05.090> much<00:03:05.180> torque<00:03:05.510> it's<00:03:06.140> so<00:03:06.290> lightweight

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:06.560 
take too much torque it's so lightweight

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:08.560 
take too much torque it's so lightweight
i<00:03:06.980> mean<00:03:07.280> you<00:03:07.640> hardly<00:03:07.820> even<00:03:08.030> notice<00:03:08.330> on<00:03:08.450> your

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:08.570 
i mean you hardly even notice on your

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:10.870 
i mean you hardly even notice on your
foot<00:03:08.780> it's<00:03:08.990> just<00:03:09.370> this<00:03:10.370> is<00:03:10.430> going<00:03:10.610> to<00:03:10.670> give<00:03:10.760> you

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:10.880 
foot it's just this is going to give you

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:12.460 
foot it's just this is going to give you
more<00:03:11.060> rotation<00:03:11.540> on<00:03:11.630> your<00:03:11.720> flips<00:03:11.990> because<00:03:12.350> you

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.470 
more rotation on your flips because you

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:14.050 
more rotation on your flips because you
have<00:03:12.590> less<00:03:12.830> weight<00:03:13.100> hanging<00:03:13.520> out<00:03:13.760> their

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:14.060 
have less weight hanging out their

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:16.270 
have less weight hanging out their
feelings<00:03:14.990> if<00:03:15.080> i<00:03:15.170> rotate<00:03:15.470> at<00:03:15.620> least<00:03:15.830> twice<00:03:16.070> as

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:16.280 
feelings if i rotate at least twice as

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:18.730 
feelings if i rotate at least twice as
fast<00:03:16.490> maybe<00:03:17.120> even<00:03:17.270> more<00:03:17.480> honestly<00:03:18.170> like<00:03:18.260> two

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:18.740 
fast maybe even more honestly like two

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:21.790 
fast maybe even more honestly like two
times<00:03:18.950> is<00:03:19.400> a<00:03:20.000> conservative<00:03:20.660> estimate<00:03:20.750> but<00:03:21.710> you

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:21.800 
times is a conservative estimate but you

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:23.590 
times is a conservative estimate but you
know<00:03:21.890> actually<00:03:22.070> speak<00:03:22.430> louder<00:03:22.640> than<00:03:22.820> words<00:03:22.910> so

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:23.600 
know actually speak louder than words so

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:25.660 
know actually speak louder than words so
let's<00:03:23.990> take<00:03:24.140> it<00:03:24.290> a<00:03:24.470> look<00:03:24.920> at<00:03:25.040> some<00:03:25.190> clips<00:03:25.490> that
