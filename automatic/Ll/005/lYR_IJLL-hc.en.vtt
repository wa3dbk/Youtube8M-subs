00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:23.170
 Hi girls, I'm with francesinhas. 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:25.509
 inverted and I did not use the 

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:28.770
 Glaze brush to doing I 

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:32.080
 I used those stickers for Francesinha 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:34.900
 Because I received enough mail asking 

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:36.400
 a more practical way you are doing 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:39.129
 this fingernail 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:44.350
 so this is how to separate the materials 

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:49.149
 basic with acetone cotton breath 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:51.969
 I used a gold graphic one blue 

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:55.420
 You can be dark using things 

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:58.739
 Whatever you want, I really liked this. 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:58.739
 combination I made 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:17.820
 Then I used inverted 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:21.080
 put it up on the nail and then 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:24.210
 I painted it right 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:25.530
 I bought in perfumery these stickers have 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:36.720
 on the internet 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:41.640
 the pharmacy is cool you take away the 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:45.390
 stick together not to ruin the 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:53.090
 low enamel 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:53.090
 I already gave two layers of gold as well 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:11.300
 I'll try to center put well where 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:11.300
 is the cuticle near half a side 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:33.160
 even waiting well to dry the deviation 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:36.090
 It may come to ruin with blue that the 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.090
 darinho 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:55.930
 right 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:28.969
 And you do not even have to wait to dry for this. 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:30.950
 removing the sticker slowly the right one 

00:03:28.969 --> 00:03:38.390
 it was a bit thick different from the ones 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:42.200
 others you are trying to fit into a 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:44.390
 in a way that is more curved or smaller 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:46.239
 you let you put the sticker as 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:52.400
 you want 

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:55.639
 it's pretty easy to do really handy 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:57.439
 this adhesive has to wait to dry even 

00:03:55.639 --> 00:04:01.549
 A little patience, too. 

00:03:57.439 --> 00:04:04.280
 doing is in the other video do not know the 

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:09.680
 I look good, I made a nail. 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:12.409
 silver and matte black is also pretty 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:14.780
