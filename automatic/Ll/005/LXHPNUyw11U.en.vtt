00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.340
 This time animal did not even want to be like that 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:24.130

 thank you for being so positive 

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:34.750
 falles and last time than me 

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:36.730
 me heavier these scorpions 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:38.500
 have thought lions hire because so 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:40.840
 one and champion did not think up 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:43.390
 I commented that really diligently 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:44.859
 you've added really cool ideas 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:47.260
 I think it's awesome and not great 

00:00:44.859 --> 00:00:48.760
 keeps motivating me to keep on gas 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.710
 give me and come up with more 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:53.140
 and above all things to keep going 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:55.480
 with these two minutes it is right 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:57.219
 cool because you say what you know 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:59.949
 want and sometimes it stops 

00:00:57.219 --> 00:01:02.859
 just yourself hard to know what 

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:04.629
 we know the community how can i do it 

00:01:02.859 --> 00:01:06.310
 best by interacting and now you are 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:07.030
 asked her to comment with 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:08.800
 leighton 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:10.570
 I enjoy it a lot I hope you 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:12.610
 that's how I got to know myself a bit 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:15.990
 and my ideas in league of legends 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:18.460
 and this time you wanted to know which 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.350
 champions are in for me personally 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:22.990
 the current meter with the current ones 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:24.670
 patches op so which actually 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:27.040
 you then champion accordingly 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:28.810
 I have to fear and this time I do it 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:32.590
 Stop it again so it really does 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:34.810
 two minutes are and there are 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:36.820
 go ahead so leblanc club is loud 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:39.159
 for me absolutely the champion the man 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:40.539
 There must be problem with lockes there 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:42.430
 players do not play the arts so well 

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:44.140
 and then she is sitting intimate enemy 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:46.270
 situation for example a bit 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.549
 newsletter i can do this damage this 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:51.340
 burst potential that does not even have 

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:53.200
 expand like other good players good 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:55.030
 Favorite players can but if you the 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.280
 Blue is well played then she is in 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:59.380
 The steering already very hard as an opponent 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.450
 to play against them and later too 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:03.909
 Intimate if she can do something Lower Rhine 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:06.130
 brushing away and being too short cool 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:07.780
 that she was super awesome 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.810
 can quickly repeat 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:14.290
 otherwise a champion of the always 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:16.510
 is strongly changed again is k 66 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:18.770
 still needs to be spellbound classics 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:21.530
 is still too strong 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:24.080
 its super strong isolation k6 is very 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.730
 very mobile with his refresh classics 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.110
 can be great to the situation 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:30.410
 adapt by being different 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:30.770
 revolutionize skills as evolve 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:32.420
 can 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:34.700
 he can jump far he can still the 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:37.280
 who develop with shampoo he has this 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:39.170
 three first now even the multi that yes 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.600
 from the raytion so how long and 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.670
 I know that was improved now 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:46.610
 rechtsbach I get it understand 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:48.560
 but not k6 and leblon these two 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:50.330
 would have warned definitely worth 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.530
 rack or if you play them yourself 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:53.900
 then you just notice something awesome 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:55.820
 power potential behind it 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.620
 otherwise a champion at that too much 

00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:01.490
 is tinkered and he is still strong 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:03.800
 six short cool from many rest secure 

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:05.960
 training phase and multi the one thick 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:08.210
 fat hyper bomb out skin that also has 

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:09.890
 a whole team at least in the 

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:11.930
 can direct the right direction so something 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:14.630
 a pity for all enemies the species 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:17.300
 are weakened really hard and six 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:19.700
 definitely belongs to the op 

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:23.300
 So you lie with champions 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:25.430
 league and six otherwise still k6 in the 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:26.810
 Channel played a business and 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:29.090
 last, before the two minutes 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:31.490
 I have found relics that are over 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:32.810
 in the top player he is the bulli first 

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:34.850
 you can not do that at first 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:37.010
 hurley defeat very great for alli 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:38.420
 Russ usually gets the first tower 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:40.580
 if you look like that the scs 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:42.500
 looking at the professional and the two 

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:44.300
 minutes past I think it has this time 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:47.570
 do not cover that we yours 

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:53.030
 Comments is two minutes aha so 

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:56.959
 two minutes it was in block k 66 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:58.850
 cleaned and 6.6 and sits and stays 

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:01.550
 So we had these four champions 

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:03.200
 you have to curious what sick first 

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:04.790
 but now that's it again 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:06.320
 Poprad two minutes 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:08.120
 I wish you a really great one 

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:10.340
