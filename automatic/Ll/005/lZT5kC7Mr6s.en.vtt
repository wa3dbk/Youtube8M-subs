 dick in free-to-play personal and 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.109
 very directly a specific game to 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.689
 people are going to talk about this matter 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.730
 good the subject of the site kotaku the link goes 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.399
 be in the description including another 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.020
 link within the article indicating where 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.760
 you can watch this episode of 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.250
 south park that I will comment on here 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.140
 beauty that happened in the latter 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.210
 now south park season have made a 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.460
 episode where Canada is having problems 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.840
 and to earn this 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.420
 solving financial problems launched a 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.440
 free game of philippine trance that are 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.730
 those two those two cities 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.070
 Canadians 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.739
 But this game is free only for the 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.780
 you 're over the stage you need to pay 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.820
 49 cents here for you to do 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.280
 business is just paying a dollar ready 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.979
 business to pay $ 3 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.630
 so the game ends up being no longer 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.909
 grace was not even what they 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.369
 were to criticize this episode this current 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:18.000
 the craze of companies to launch games 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:20.880
 free and in a way that is not 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.920
 nothing serious because it's not even me 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.740
 Example I played at the beginning of Facebook I 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:28.650
 I played a game called It was a lot to do. 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.750
 One day I went to see myself, and beauty did not 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:33.060
 I played for free, it's only you, and not 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.369
 I know what makes you plant you have there 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.140
 To wait two hours is just to leave. 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.430
 they give a different buck but 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.250
 has the averages that you get a player 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:43.140
 advance the dollars and the green beans there 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.210
 plant and you have two hours to them the 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.320
 option you can speed up your plant 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:51.720
 buying compost costs only $ 10 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:53.579
 I speak 200 and I 'm going to spend 10 and come 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.930
 make gold and I'll go and buy 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:57.149
 a better seed 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:59.700
 this is the reasoning you were smart 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:01.950
 there you go there paid composting plant grows 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:05.130
 You pick up the money, buy another plant. 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:07.020
 And then when you see you broke your 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.390
 dollars and the greens nec a game of theo 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.950
 and it gives you the option great beauty but 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.200
 served as the game is when you use the 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.040
 cash when they appear paid then here 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.709
 have the option of goal 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:19.950
 use more for $ 10 real- world 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:23.549
 there you create an addiction in the person and the 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:25.379
 person enters this addiction is the 

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:29.459
 That little boy did not forget his name. 

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:31.769
 What's the difference? 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:33.840
 so there in south park that he said 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:35.670
 staff and has a very good 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.470
 episode I will not speak of the final 8 of 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.569
 everything to make history for you in this 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.920
 week fine thank him with for 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:42.209
 game with the ace 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.219
 He talks about how people said the 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:45.689
 First you hit the pebble 

00:02:44.219 --> 00:02:48.389
 grace to person to person 

00:02:45.689 --> 00:02:50.730
 laÃ­za those more vital thereafter you 

00:02:48.389 --> 00:02:54.349
 snake that not she will already have hooked and 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:57.480
 then you charge more and more and more 

00:02:54.349 --> 00:03:00.030
 even more the style of the game was a 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.590
 criticism is also the game of the family guy is 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:03.540
 a recent free game that came out 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:06.329
 fernando do family guy a family from 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:09.000
 here in Brazil and the game is then 

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:11.220
 So bad, then he asked for the mission. 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.709
 the game you only pay if you only you 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:15.389
 Pass you have an item that costs 5 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:16.950
 kind of get a dollar point 

00:03:15.389 --> 00:03:18.449
 game you do not advance 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:20.579
 unless you pay for it 

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:22.409
 It's getting more and more common and we 

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:25.139
 gamers are extremely against this 

00:03:22.409 --> 00:03:26.879
 but we try to call just 

00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:29.310
 but as long as you have a person with a 

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:31.229
 old building, no use has nothing 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:32.879
 What are we going to do? 

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:34.530
 companies that continue because they have 

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:36.150
 people who are optionally 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.930
 buying credits for this type of 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.159
 game 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:41.220
 I am very much against the 

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:43.739
 im the fish i think really well wrong 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:44.819
 I do not think I remember when it was the 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:47.010
 first game I saw that the fish 

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:50.220
 even always wrong and I never agreed 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:52.500
 a lot with this and for example give up 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:55.379
 microtransactions in flash book in ismat 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:57.870
 but only microtransactions that give you 

00:03:55.379 --> 00:04:00.239
 aesthetic improvements in case you 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:02.609
 spent on points is a piece of cake and you 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:04.769
 buy a different skin I think 

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:06.870
 personally that business is aesthetic there 

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:08.189
 fuck each other to give each 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:09.900
 One if I want to leave a little doll. 

00:04:08.189 --> 00:04:11.099
 differentiated using real money then I 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.150
 I think it has to do with me. 

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:14.009
 now I get really enough 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:16.139
 troubled with these games that the air 

00:04:14.009 --> 00:04:18.419
 killing it costs $ 2 is the best of 

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:20.250
 all other right and only way to 

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:21.959
 people stop with these companies do 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:24.029
 to enforce the im 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:25.529
 We stop spending, I know. 

00:04:24.029 --> 00:04:27.210
 are you in your house but I never 

00:04:25.529 --> 00:04:28.860
 I bought friends ever 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:30.780
 buy a package that never bought who 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:32.880
 buy someone buy this fucking 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:35.370
 companies or sell to a 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:37.560
 good example is the goat outside felt that 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:39.210
 goal that the focus has a multiplayer and has 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:41.759
 a sword of god I think it's a 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:44.069
 business so it costs 3 dollars 

00:04:41.759 --> 00:04:44.940
 I do not know and shuffle even stronger than 

00:04:44.069 --> 00:04:46.800
 game is online 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:48.120
 in May the whole room you enter goes 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:50.250
 have a guy that crap that 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:52.770
 state appealed to cattle in the 

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:55.800
 game still was pumping because the banana 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:57.900
 head of the guy I went to old me 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:01.710
 I can spend 15 hours playing this 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:04.349
 fucking and kicking asshole or I can 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:07.020
 spend $ 5 and your fucker 

00:05:04.349 --> 00:05:08.280
 Fuck the arena and then this guy who is 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:09.630
 breaking the gaming market is 

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:10.889
 he is not connected 

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:13.470
 I do not think it's his fault unfortunately 

00:05:10.889 --> 00:05:14.970
 I know the market is going to people 

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:16.320
 have to always give advice to staff 

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:18.030
 that the fish had been wrong or that 

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:19.530
 pay to go wrong and this episode 

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:21.389
 arises for what it really was 

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:22.919
 there is no game for free right he 

00:05:21.389 --> 00:05:24.690
 Explode Explain Shows the whole 

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:26.699
 Canadian government's entire conspiracy to 

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:29.610
 behind this game of grace and their idea 

00:05:26.699 --> 00:05:30.990
 It's really just talking the game for free. 

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:33.690
 you need to pay 5 dollars for 

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:35.190
 keep playing and that's it and we 

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:38.400
 sees this very often presents the 

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:40.139
 Can day care is a bitch and then success 

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:41.880
 that we know is free but 

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:45.030
 you die three times you need or 

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:48.060
 wait half an hour or pay 1 99 a life 

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:49.500
 and if not, it's not for free, but my friend 

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:51.479
 Anyway, people want to know the opinion of 

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:53.070
 I told you how I read the matter 

00:05:51.479 --> 00:05:55.680
 kotaku's website already has a link to 

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:57.719

 but for now it 's in English but 

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:05.340
