state my opinions I want people to

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:23.160 
state my opinions I want people to
understand<00:00:22.360> that<00:00:22.600> there<00:00:22.750> is<00:00:22.780> actually

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:23.170

understand that there is actually
something<00:00:23.350> behind<00:00:23.590> it<00:00:23.980> and<00:00:24.220> not<00:00:24.370> just<00:00:24.640> empty

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:25.180

talk now for a few days I've heard a lot
of<00:00:27.730> people<00:00:28.090> saying<00:00:28.420> how<00:00:28.660> easy<00:00:28.930> it<00:00:29.110> is<00:00:29.170> to<00:00:29.230> use

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:29.380 
of people saying how easy it is to use

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:31.740 
of people saying how easy it is to use
ESF<00:00:29.980> sand<00:00:30.310> how<00:00:30.490> hard<00:00:30.700> is<00:00:30.850> to<00:00:31.030> use<00:00:31.180> tanks<00:00:31.510> and

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:31.750 
ESF sand how hard is to use tanks and

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:34.349 
ESF sand how hard is to use tanks and
some<00:00:31.840> search<00:00:32.050> and<00:00:32.460> saying<00:00:33.460> that<00:00:33.640> they<00:00:34.030> get<00:00:34.210> all

00:00:34.349 --> 00:00:34.359 
some search and saying that they get all

00:00:34.359 --> 00:00:36.000 
some search and saying that they get all
these<00:00:34.539> kids<00:00:34.809> very<00:00:35.170> easily<00:00:35.350> with<00:00:35.559> these<00:00:35.739> ifs

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:36.010 
these kids very easily with these ifs

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:37.709 
these kids very easily with these ifs
but<00:00:36.519> unfortunately<00:00:37.149> I<00:00:37.179> never<00:00:37.480> get<00:00:37.629> a<00:00:37.659> chance

00:00:37.709 --> 00:00:37.719 
but unfortunately I never get a chance

00:00:37.719 --> 00:00:40.619 
but unfortunately I never get a chance
to<00:00:38.109> see<00:00:38.379> it<00:00:38.559> so<00:00:39.100> now<00:00:39.190> if<00:00:39.399> you<00:00:39.579> are<00:00:39.760> a<00:00:39.789> non-pilot

00:00:40.619 --> 00:00:40.629 
to see it so now if you are a non-pilot

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:43.649 
to see it so now if you are a non-pilot
and<00:00:41.140> you<00:00:41.649> want<00:00:41.829> to<00:00:41.920> get<00:00:42.249> into<00:00:42.909> any<00:00:43.149> SF<00:00:43.420> and

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:43.659 
and you want to get into any SF and

00:00:43.659 --> 00:00:46.229 
and you want to get into any SF and
start<00:00:44.079> farming<00:00:44.350> infantry<00:00:44.979> or<00:00:45.129> tanks<00:00:45.579> with<00:00:45.789> the

00:00:46.229 --> 00:00:46.239 
start farming infantry or tanks with the

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:48.599 
start farming infantry or tanks with the
rocket<00:00:46.510> pods<00:00:46.690> or<00:00:46.929> the<00:00:47.530> rotary<00:00:47.920> well<00:00:48.309> then<00:00:48.519> you

00:00:48.599 --> 00:00:48.609 
rocket pods or the rotary well then you

00:00:48.609 --> 00:00:51.090 
rocket pods or the rotary well then you
have<00:00:48.640> at<00:00:48.909> least<00:00:49.059> one<00:00:49.390> massive<00:00:49.899> advantage<00:00:50.469> over

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:51.100 
have at least one massive advantage over

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:53.639 
have at least one massive advantage over
pilots<00:00:51.819> like<00:00:51.999> myself<00:00:52.210> or<00:00:52.659> my<00:00:52.690> friends<00:00:53.559> in

00:00:53.639 --> 00:00:53.649 
pilots like myself or my friends in

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:56.099 
pilots like myself or my friends in
bling<00:00:53.889> and<00:00:54.159> that<00:00:54.729> is<00:00:54.879> that<00:00:55.210> when<00:00:55.780> they<00:00:56.050> see

00:00:56.099 --> 00:00:56.109 
bling and that is that when they see

00:00:56.109 --> 00:00:57.629 
bling and that is that when they see
your<00:00:56.469> name<00:00:56.679> they<00:00:56.979> are<00:00:57.100> most<00:00:57.309> likely<00:00:57.519> not

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:57.639 
your name they are most likely not

00:00:57.639 --> 00:00:59.910 
your name they are most likely not
consider<00:00:58.120> you<00:00:58.359> a<00:00:58.629> high<00:00:59.049> threat<00:00:59.409> and<00:00:59.710> you<00:00:59.739> will

00:00:59.910 --> 00:00:59.920 
consider you a high threat and you will

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:01.770 
consider you a high threat and you will
probably<00:01:00.219> get<00:01:00.519> away<00:01:00.639> with<00:01:00.819> a<00:01:01.089> few<00:01:01.389> more<00:01:01.510> runs

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:01.780 
probably get away with a few more runs

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:03.809 
probably get away with a few more runs
before<00:01:02.530> your<00:01:02.859> opponent's<00:01:03.309> start<00:01:03.549> spawning

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:03.819 
before your opponent's start spawning

00:01:03.819 --> 00:01:05.940 
before your opponent's start spawning
and<00:01:04.089> the<00:01:04.180> air<00:01:04.360> and<00:01:04.629> the<00:01:05.110> lock<00:01:05.320> wants<00:01:05.590> to<00:01:05.770> get

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:05.950 
and the air and the lock wants to get

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:08.070 
and the air and the lock wants to get
rid<00:01:06.130> of<00:01:06.190> you<00:01:06.310> I<00:01:06.700> also<00:01:07.300> think<00:01:07.570> that<00:01:07.690> the

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:08.080 
rid of you I also think that the

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:09.660 
rid of you I also think that the
survivability<00:01:08.620> of<00:01:08.740> the<00:01:09.040> tanks<00:01:09.340> is<00:01:09.460> much

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:09.670 
survivability of the tanks is much

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:11.640 
survivability of the tanks is much
higher<00:01:09.940> than<00:01:10.000> with<00:01:10.540> the<00:01:10.630> sf's<00:01:10.960> being<00:01:11.320> that<00:01:11.530> you

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:11.650 
higher than with the sf's being that you

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:13.560 
higher than with the sf's being that you
don't<00:01:11.830> have<00:01:11.950> to<00:01:12.100> get<00:01:12.250> that<00:01:12.370> far<00:01:12.790> away<00:01:13.000> from<00:01:13.180> the

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:13.570 
don't have to get that far away from the

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:16.290 
don't have to get that far away from the
battle<00:01:13.720> before<00:01:14.380> you<00:01:14.710> are<00:01:14.890> in<00:01:15.040> safety<00:01:15.550> many

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:16.300 
battle before you are in safety many

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:17.880 
battle before you are in safety many
times<00:01:16.570> you<00:01:16.810> just<00:01:17.020> need<00:01:17.230> to<00:01:17.320> back<00:01:17.500> up<00:01:17.530> a<00:01:17.860> few

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:17.890 
times you just need to back up a few

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:20.480 
times you just need to back up a few
meters<00:01:18.400> and<00:01:18.640> you<00:01:18.910> are<00:01:19.090> away<00:01:19.480> from<00:01:19.540> enemy<00:01:20.110> fire

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
meters and you are away from enemy fire

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.130 
meters and you are away from enemy fire
this<00:01:21.490> allows<00:01:21.730> for<00:01:22.000> much<00:01:22.150> faster<00:01:22.540> repairs<00:01:22.870> and

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:23.140 
this allows for much faster repairs and

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:25.080 
this allows for much faster repairs and
it<00:01:23.470> allows<00:01:23.680> you<00:01:23.830> to<00:01:23.980> quickly<00:01:24.220> get<00:01:24.580> back<00:01:24.850> into

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:25.090 
it allows you to quickly get back into

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:27.030 
it allows you to quickly get back into
the<00:01:25.360> fight<00:01:25.390> unlike<00:01:26.230> what<00:01:26.410> you<00:01:26.530> can<00:01:26.680> do<00:01:26.800> if

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:27.040 
the fight unlike what you can do if

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.190 
the fight unlike what you can do if
you're<00:01:27.220> a<00:01:27.280> pilot<00:01:27.580> then<00:01:27.790> you<00:01:27.880> have<00:01:27.970> to<00:01:28.090> land<00:01:28.270> 700

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:29.200 
you're a pilot then you have to land 700

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.320 
you're a pilot then you have to land 700
meters<00:01:29.560> away<00:01:29.680> from<00:01:29.830> the<00:01:30.040> actual<00:01:30.400> battle<00:01:30.880> in

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:31.330 
meters away from the actual battle in

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:32.610 
meters away from the actual battle in
this<00:01:31.450> situation<00:01:31.720> I<00:01:31.990> was<00:01:32.110> able<00:01:32.200> to<00:01:32.380> get<00:01:32.500> a<00:01:32.530> few

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:32.620 
this situation I was able to get a few

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:34.680 
this situation I was able to get a few
kids<00:01:33.040> when<00:01:33.400> I<00:01:33.430> was<00:01:33.610> resupplying<00:01:34.060> as<00:01:34.210> well<00:01:34.390> and

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:34.690 
kids when I was resupplying as well and

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:37.230 
kids when I was resupplying as well and
resupplying<00:01:35.500> is<00:01:35.650> another<00:01:35.860> aspect<00:01:36.760> of<00:01:37.150> the

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:37.240 
resupplying is another aspect of the

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.230 
resupplying is another aspect of the
game<00:01:37.270> that<00:01:37.660> favors<00:01:38.380> tanks<00:01:38.710> heavily<00:01:39.130> it's<00:01:39.820> much

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:40.240 
game that favors tanks heavily it's much

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.210 
game that favors tanks heavily it's much
easier<00:01:40.270> to<00:01:40.600> stick<00:01:40.870> with<00:01:41.080> mo<00:01:41.350> sandra's<00:01:41.830> meaning

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:42.220 
easier to stick with mo sandra's meaning

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:43.590 
easier to stick with mo sandra's meaning
that<00:01:42.310> you<00:01:42.460> never<00:01:42.700> really<00:01:42.970> have<00:01:43.180> to<00:01:43.330> resupply

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:43.600 
that you never really have to resupply

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.870 
that you never really have to resupply
at<00:01:43.870> all<00:01:44.050> and<00:01:44.320> once<00:01:45.250> you<00:01:45.400> have<00:01:45.580> fully

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:45.880 
at all and once you have fully

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.230 
at all and once you have fully
resupplied<00:01:46.120> your<00:01:46.840> mo<00:01:47.020> lasts<00:01:47.560> a<00:01:47.680> lot<00:01:47.890> longer<00:01:48.240> so

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:49.240 
resupplied your mo lasts a lot longer so

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:50.370 
resupplied your mo lasts a lot longer so
now<00:01:49.360> another<00:01:49.570> thing<00:01:49.690> that<00:01:49.990> people<00:01:50.290> have

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:50.380 
now another thing that people have

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:51.930 
now another thing that people have
pointed<00:01:50.530> out<00:01:50.770> is<00:01:50.950> that<00:01:51.160> within<00:01:51.370> yourself<00:01:51.820> you

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:51.940 
pointed out is that within yourself you

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:53.910 
pointed out is that within yourself you
can<00:01:52.120> constantly<00:01:52.540> deal<00:01:52.810> damage<00:01:53.110> while

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:53.920 
can constantly deal damage while

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:55.620 
can constantly deal damage while
maintaining<00:01:54.340> your<00:01:54.610> aim<00:01:54.760> on<00:01:54.910> your<00:01:55.030> target<00:01:55.240> and

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:55.630 
maintaining your aim on your target and

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:57.420 
maintaining your aim on your target and
while<00:01:56.110> you're<00:01:56.140> reloading<00:01:56.409> you<00:01:56.830> switch<00:01:57.070> to<00:01:57.310> the

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:57.430 
while you're reloading you switch to the

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:00.090 
while you're reloading you switch to the
other<00:01:57.610> weapon<00:01:58.240> and<00:01:58.450> you<00:01:59.140> keep<00:01:59.320> firing<00:01:59.800> while

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:00.100 
other weapon and you keep firing while

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:02.100 
other weapon and you keep firing while
the<00:02:00.400> reloading<00:02:00.820> animation<00:02:01.300> is<00:02:01.420> taking<00:02:01.960> place

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:02.110 
the reloading animation is taking place

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:04.830 
the reloading animation is taking place
and<00:02:02.560> as<00:02:03.550> much<00:02:03.700> as<00:02:03.760> this<00:02:04.000> is<00:02:04.180> actually<00:02:04.540> possible

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
and as much as this is actually possible

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.200 
and as much as this is actually possible
and<00:02:05.380> as<00:02:05.770> much<00:02:05.980> as<00:02:06.010> this<00:02:06.280> sounds<00:02:06.760> very

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:07.210 
and as much as this sounds very

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:10.680 
and as much as this sounds very
effective<00:02:08.019> in<00:02:08.289> theory<00:02:08.800> that<00:02:09.429> is<00:02:09.580> really<00:02:10.300> hard

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
effective in theory that is really hard

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:13.330 
effective in theory that is really hard
to<00:02:10.929> do<00:02:11.170> now<00:02:12.100> don't<00:02:12.250> get<00:02:12.400> me<00:02:12.520> wrong<00:02:12.550> in

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
to do now don't get me wrong in

to do now don't get me wrong in
several<00:02:13.610> of<00:02:13.760> my<00:02:13.970> older<00:02:14.300> tutorials<00:02:14.810> I<00:02:15.019> have

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
several of my older tutorials I have

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.350 
several of my older tutorials I have
explained<00:02:16.069> to<00:02:16.190> the<00:02:16.310> importance<00:02:16.760> of<00:02:16.940> switching

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
explained to the importance of switching

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.170 
explained to the importance of switching
weapons<00:02:17.480> while<00:02:17.989> you<00:02:18.290> are<00:02:18.470> reloading<00:02:18.950> but<00:02:19.670> to

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
weapons while you are reloading but to

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.300 
weapons while you are reloading but to
be<00:02:20.300> able<00:02:20.330> to<00:02:20.629> maintain<00:02:20.810> your<00:02:21.319> aim<00:02:21.560> on<00:02:21.860> a<00:02:21.890> target

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
be able to maintain your aim on a target

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.040 
be able to maintain your aim on a target
the<00:02:22.910> way<00:02:23.030> you<00:02:23.090> can<00:02:23.300> do<00:02:23.390> with<00:02:23.510> the<00:02:23.599> tank<00:02:23.870> like

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.050 
the way you can do with the tank like

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:26.259 
the way you can do with the tank like
this<00:02:24.080> for<00:02:24.379> example<00:02:24.489> for<00:02:25.489> more<00:02:25.670> than<00:02:25.790> like<00:02:26.000> 10

00:02:26.259 --> 00:02:26.269 
this for example for more than like 10

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:28.210 
this for example for more than like 10
seconds<00:02:26.690> there<00:02:27.319> are<00:02:27.470> very<00:02:27.800> few<00:02:27.890> situations

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 
seconds there are very few situations

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:30.610 
seconds there are very few situations
where<00:02:28.790> this<00:02:28.910> is<00:02:29.060> even<00:02:29.390> possible<00:02:29.540> and<00:02:30.080> that<00:02:30.110> is

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
where this is even possible and that is

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:33.190 
where this is even possible and that is
even<00:02:30.920> for<00:02:31.129> the<00:02:31.220> most<00:02:31.340> experienced<00:02:32.060> pilots<00:02:32.200> now

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
even for the most experienced pilots now

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.440 
even for the most experienced pilots now
the<00:02:33.260> best<00:02:33.650> way<00:02:33.799> to<00:02:33.860> do<00:02:34.040> that<00:02:34.069> is<00:02:34.459> to<00:02:34.549> shoot<00:02:35.299> from

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
the best way to do that is to shoot from

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:37.570 
the best way to do that is to shoot from
very<00:02:35.840> far<00:02:35.930> away<00:02:36.140> you're<00:02:37.040> not<00:02:37.190> going<00:02:37.370> to<00:02:37.430> do<00:02:37.549> a

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:37.580 
very far away you're not going to do a

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:39.490 
very far away you're not going to do a
lot<00:02:37.760> of<00:02:37.819> damage<00:02:38.090> and<00:02:38.450> a<00:02:38.629> lot<00:02:38.810> of<00:02:38.840> your<00:02:39.110> bullets

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
lot of damage and a lot of your bullets

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.160 
lot of damage and a lot of your bullets
and<00:02:39.650> rockets<00:02:39.920> are<00:02:40.040> going<00:02:40.250> to<00:02:40.370> miss<00:02:40.549> but<00:02:41.269> if<00:02:41.870> you

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
and rockets are going to miss but if you

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:45.430 
and rockets are going to miss but if you
think<00:02:42.890> that<00:02:43.099> this<00:02:43.280> is<00:02:43.519> a<00:02:43.549> far<00:02:44.420> more<00:02:44.720> effective

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.440 
think that this is a far more effective

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.620 
think that this is a far more effective
way<00:02:45.590> of<00:02:45.620> playing<00:02:46.069> than<00:02:46.610> the<00:02:46.790> way<00:02:46.910> I<00:02:46.940> explain<00:02:47.480> it

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:47.630 
way of playing than the way I explain it

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:50.410 
way of playing than the way I explain it
then<00:02:48.110> by<00:02:48.349> all<00:02:48.380> means<00:02:48.560> show<00:02:49.400> us<00:02:49.610> so<00:02:50.209> anyway

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 
then by all means show us so anyway

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:52.240 
then by all means show us so anyway
there's<00:02:50.780> more<00:02:50.959> tanked<00:02:51.230> ray<00:02:51.290> coming<00:02:51.860> in<00:02:52.160> the

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250 
there's more tanked ray coming in the

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:54.039 
there's more tanked ray coming in the
near<00:02:52.370> future<00:02:52.430> and<00:02:52.940> I<00:02:53.450> would<00:02:53.599> say<00:02:53.750> thank<00:02:53.959> you

00:02:54.039 --> 00:02:54.049 
near future and I would say thank you

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:58.090 
near future and I would say thank you
all<00:02:54.200> for<00:02:54.410> watching<00:02:54.530> and<00:02:54.920> bye<00:02:55.849> for<00:02:55.880> now
