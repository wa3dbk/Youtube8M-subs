00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.060 
one iron bar and one piece of wood and
you<00:01:00.120> get<00:01:00.270> thirty<00:01:00.600> pieces<00:01:00.870> of<00:01:01.199> track<00:01:01.440> which<00:01:02.039> is

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070

really<00:01:02.460> cool<00:01:02.699> and<00:01:03.080> on<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.229> NT<00:01:04.619> you<00:01:04.949> can

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
really cool and on the NT you can

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:10.219

actually<00:01:05.309> change<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:08.420> what<00:01:09.420> happens<00:01:09.869> when

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
actually change the what happens when

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.740 
actually change the what happens when
the<00:01:10.500> cart<00:01:10.740> gets<00:01:11.040> to<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.340> end<00:01:11.460> of<00:01:11.580> the<00:01:11.640> track<00:01:11.909> so

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
the cart gets to the end of the track so

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.320 
the cart gets to the end of the track so
I've<00:01:12.930> used<00:01:12.960> a<00:01:13.290> hammer<00:01:13.530> to<00:01:14.430> change<00:01:14.820> them<00:01:15.119> or

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
I've used a hammer to change them or

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.200 
I've used a hammer to change them or
it's<00:01:15.509> a<00:01:15.659> glorified<00:01:16.590> jackhammer<00:01:17.189> to<00:01:17.939> change

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
it's a glorified jackhammer to change

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.359 
it's a glorified jackhammer to change
them<00:01:18.450> into<00:01:18.630> bumpers<00:01:19.439> which<00:01:19.950> makes<00:01:20.220> the

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
them into bumpers which makes the

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.520 
them into bumpers which makes the
minecart<00:01:20.820> go<00:01:20.970> back<00:01:21.180> and<00:01:21.390> forward<00:01:21.720> so<00:01:22.320> when<00:01:22.470> you

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
minecart go back and forward so when you

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.190 
minecart go back and forward so when you
right-click<00:01:22.740> it<00:01:23.240> it<00:01:24.240> changes<00:01:24.689> into<00:01:24.840> a<00:01:24.960> little

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
right-click it it changes into a little

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.830 
right-click it it changes into a little
go-kart<00:01:25.650> and<00:01:25.970> this<00:01:26.970> is<00:01:27.119> going<00:01:27.270> to<00:01:27.330> allow<00:01:27.600> us<00:01:27.630> to

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
go-kart and this is going to allow us to

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.679 
go-kart and this is going to allow us to
go<00:01:28.110> back<00:01:28.320> and<00:01:28.500> forward<00:01:28.979> to<00:01:29.759> collect<00:01:30.360> all<00:01:30.540> the

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
go back and forward to collect all the

go back and forward to collect all the
slime<00:01:30.960> and<00:01:31.340> slime<00:01:32.340> sauce<00:01:32.579> and<00:01:32.939> you<00:01:33.450> just<00:01:33.600> use<00:01:33.720> a

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
slime and slime sauce and you just use a

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.380 
slime and slime sauce and you just use a
weapon<00:01:34.110> or<00:01:34.229> something<00:01:34.500> to<00:01:34.619> get<00:01:34.740> out<00:01:34.920> of<00:01:35.040> it<00:01:35.390> all

and helping me out a little bit I know a
bit<00:01:54.270> about<00:01:54.450> wiring<00:01:55.320> but<00:01:55.710> I've<00:01:56.040> still<00:01:56.280> got<00:01:56.369> a

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
bit about wiring but I've still got a

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.249 
bit about wiring but I've still got a
bit<00:01:56.549> to<00:01:56.670> learn<00:01:56.790> myself<00:01:57.000> so<00:01:57.960> they've<00:01:58.110> been

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
bit to learn myself so they've been

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.830 
bit to learn myself so they've been
offering<00:01:58.710> some<00:01:59.100> advice<00:01:59.579> and<00:01:59.880> support<00:02:00.060> which

is<00:02:01.049> really<00:02:01.649> really<00:02:01.770> cool<00:02:01.920> and<00:02:02.630> furthermore<00:02:03.630> I

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
is really really cool and furthermore I

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.399 
is really really cool and furthermore I
believe<00:02:04.049> that<00:02:04.799> this<00:02:05.009> bat<00:02:05.840> thymus<00:02:06.840> statue<00:02:07.170> I

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
believe that this bat thymus statue I

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.889 
believe that this bat thymus statue I
think<00:02:07.799> he<00:02:07.890> calls<00:02:08.129> that<00:02:08.280> a<00:02:08.369> rain<00:02:08.580> stick<00:02:08.910> is<00:02:09.179> zero

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
think he calls that a rain stick is zero

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.720 
think he calls that a rain stick is zero
gravitas<00:02:10.410> design<00:02:11.629> and<00:02:12.629> I've<00:02:12.959> sort<00:02:13.230> of

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
gravitas design and I've sort of

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.589

run with that and it has a lot of a lot
of<00:02:17.690> different<00:02:17.989> uses<00:02:18.170> so<00:02:18.650> it's<00:02:18.800> really<00:02:19.129> good<00:02:19.340> so

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
the main thing they told me is that the

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:31.479 
the main thing they told me is that the
slime<00:02:29.660> statues<00:02:30.200> can<00:02:30.380> actually<00:02:30.650> be<00:02:30.739> activated

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:31.489 
slime statues can actually be activated

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:36.460 
slime statues can actually be activated
up<00:02:31.940> to<00:02:32.269> six<00:02:32.599> times<00:02:32.900> and<00:02:33.880> look<00:02:35.110> what<00:02:36.110> we<00:02:36.290> were

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
up to six times and look what we were

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:38.770 
up to six times and look what we were
doing<00:02:36.800> activating<00:02:37.519> it<00:02:37.610> three<00:02:37.849> times<00:02:38.120> was<00:02:38.450> fine

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
doing activating it three times was fine

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:41.410 
doing activating it three times was fine
and<00:02:39.110> you<00:02:39.830> know<00:02:39.860> it<00:02:40.130> was<00:02:40.250> doing<00:02:40.519> the<00:02:40.640> job<00:02:40.670> but<00:02:41.239> I

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:41.420 
and you know it was doing the job but I

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:43.030 
and you know it was doing the job but I
guess<00:02:41.660> what<00:02:41.930> we're<00:02:42.080> looking<00:02:42.410> at<00:02:42.470> doing<00:02:42.530> now

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
guess what we're looking at doing now

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.900 
guess what we're looking at doing now
and<00:02:43.879> I<00:02:43.910> just<00:02:44.049> going<00:02:45.049> to<00:02:45.110> clean<00:02:45.290> this<00:02:45.440> up<00:02:45.500> a<00:02:45.709> bit

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 
and I just going to clean this up a bit

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:48.520 
and I just going to clean this up a bit
what<00:02:46.910> we're<00:02:47.090> looking<00:02:47.390> at<00:02:47.480> doing<00:02:47.540> now<00:02:47.930> guys<00:02:48.290> is

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
what we're looking at doing now guys is

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:50.650 
what we're looking at doing now guys is
actually<00:02:48.890> pushing<00:02:49.310> these<00:02:49.670> traps<00:02:50.030> that<00:02:50.209> little

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:50.660 
actually pushing these traps that little

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:53.440 
actually pushing these traps that little
bit<00:02:50.780> further<00:02:51.819> so<00:02:52.819> you<00:02:52.849> can<00:02:53.060> see<00:02:53.209> I've<00:02:53.329> got

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
bit further so you can see I've got

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:56.050 
bit further so you can see I've got
alternating<00:02:54.140> colors<00:02:54.530> touching<00:02:55.430> the<00:02:55.549> slime<00:02:55.819> in

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
alternating colors touching the slime in

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.089 
alternating colors touching the slime in
six<00:02:56.420> different<00:02:56.569> points<00:02:57.200> and<00:02:57.380> there's

00:02:58.089 --> 00:02:58.099 
six different points and there's

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:00.400 
six different points and there's
actually<00:02:58.610> two<00:02:59.090> points<00:02:59.420> that<00:02:59.900> you<00:03:00.049> can<00:03:00.200> touch

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.410 
actually two points that you can touch

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:03.699 
actually two points that you can touch
above<00:03:00.769> the<00:03:00.980> statue<00:03:01.360> so<00:03:02.360> imagine<00:03:03.079> it's<00:03:03.200> like<00:03:03.500> a

00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:03.709 
above the statue so imagine it's like a

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:08.920 
above the statue so imagine it's like a
two<00:03:04.040> by<00:03:04.370> six<00:03:04.819> little<00:03:05.660> grid<00:03:06.079> there<00:03:06.549> so<00:03:07.930> the

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
two by six little grid there so the

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:09.880 
two by six little grid there so the
other<00:03:08.959> thing<00:03:09.319> I'm<00:03:09.440> going<00:03:09.620> to<00:03:09.680> show<00:03:09.860> you

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:09.890 
other thing I'm going to show you

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:15.970 
other thing I'm going to show you
quickly<00:03:10.280> and<00:03:13.540> what<00:03:14.540> it<00:03:14.660> is<00:03:14.840> is<00:03:15.140> to<00:03:15.470> maximize

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980 
quickly and what it is is to maximize

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:19.210 
quickly and what it is is to maximize
the<00:03:16.220> amount<00:03:16.310> of<00:03:16.549> slimes<00:03:16.880> that<00:03:17.180> can<00:03:17.329> spawn<00:03:18.220> you

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:19.220 
the amount of slimes that can spawn you

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:21.520 
the amount of slimes that can spawn you
can<00:03:19.400> actually<00:03:19.549> if<00:03:19.970> there's<00:03:20.180> 12<00:03:20.720> blocks<00:03:21.079> apart

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:21.530 
can actually if there's 12 blocks apart

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:25.840 
can actually if there's 12 blocks apart
the<00:03:22.519> statute<00:03:23.030> limit<00:03:23.329> rises<00:03:23.840> from<00:03:24.280> three<00:03:25.280> our

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:25.850 
the statute limit rises from three our

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:29.740 
the statute limit rises from three our
slimes<00:03:26.840> per<00:03:27.200> statue<00:03:27.560> to<00:03:27.980> six<00:03:28.450> so<00:03:29.450> that's<00:03:29.569> a

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:29.750 
slimes per statue to six so that's a

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:32.680 
slimes per statue to six so that's a
massive<00:03:30.079> gain<00:03:30.799> there<00:03:31.100> and<00:03:31.340> I<00:03:32.269> just<00:03:32.329> did<00:03:32.660> a

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:32.690 
massive gain there and I just did a

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:34.870 
massive gain there and I just did a
little<00:03:32.810> trick<00:03:33.109> there<00:03:33.290> quickly<00:03:34.010> and<00:03:34.190> I<00:03:34.459> really

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:34.880 
little trick there quickly and I really

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:37.270 
little trick there quickly and I really
recommend<00:03:35.239> you<00:03:35.299> do<00:03:35.510> this<00:03:35.750> so<00:03:36.680> I<00:03:36.709> needed<00:03:37.069> to

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:37.280 
recommend you do this so I needed to

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:40.449 
recommend you do this so I needed to
count<00:03:37.519> out<00:03:37.730> 12<00:03:38.180> blocks<00:03:38.799> so<00:03:39.799> what<00:03:39.950> I<00:03:39.980> do<00:03:40.130> is

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:40.459 
count out 12 blocks so what I do is

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:42.340 
count out 12 blocks so what I do is
actually<00:03:40.609> right-click<00:03:41.299> and<00:03:41.480> separate<00:03:42.019> that

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:42.350 
actually right-click and separate that

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:46.599 
actually right-click and separate that
pile<00:03:42.680> and<00:03:43.090> then<00:03:44.090> after<00:03:45.049> I<00:03:45.079> kill<00:03:45.290> zombie<00:03:45.620> then

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:46.609 
pile and then after I kill zombie then

00:03:46.609 --> 00:03:48.879 
pile and then after I kill zombie then
starting<00:03:47.389> at<00:03:47.510> the<00:03:47.630> slime<00:03:47.900> statue<00:03:48.170> there<00:03:48.590> so

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:48.889 
starting at the slime statue there so

00:03:48.889 --> 00:03:50.860 
starting at the slime statue there so
the<00:03:49.190> two<00:03:49.400> blocks<00:03:49.910> it<00:03:50.090> occupies<00:03:50.510> we're<00:03:50.750> not

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:50.870

using I can just count using the stack
of<00:03:53.450> 12<00:03:53.690> and<00:03:54.109> I<00:03:54.950> know<00:03:55.010> it's<00:03:55.400> going<00:03:55.579> to<00:03:55.670> be<00:03:55.730> 12

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:56.380

sometimes I used to use my whole stack
and<00:03:59.510> try<00:03:59.720> and<00:03:59.870> count<00:04:00.079> that<00:04:00.290> way<00:04:00.440> it's<00:04:01.010> really

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:01.310 
and try and count that way it's really

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:02.770

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:44.520 
too bad so there you go just in the time

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:47.180 
too bad so there you go just in the time
I'm<00:05:44.699> talking<00:05:44.880> we've<00:05:45.240> got<00:05:45.449> Neil<00:05:45.840> basically<00:05:46.560> mm

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:47.190 
I'm talking we've got Neil basically mm

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:50.110 
I'm talking we've got Neil basically mm
gel<00:05:47.630> all<00:05:48.630> right<00:05:48.840> so<00:05:49.139> let's<00:05:49.320> turn<00:05:49.500> that<00:05:49.650> off<00:05:49.830> and

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:50.120 
gel all right so let's turn that off and

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:52.219 
gel all right so let's turn that off and
that's<00:05:51.120> pretty<00:05:51.360> much<00:05:51.479> all<00:05:51.659> there<00:05:51.780> is<00:05:51.840> to<00:05:51.960> it

00:05:52.219 --> 00:05:52.229 
that's pretty much all there is to it

00:05:52.229 --> 00:05:53.899 
that's pretty much all there is to it
guys<00:05:52.259> now

00:05:53.899 --> 00:05:53.909 
guys now

00:05:53.909 --> 00:05:55.790 
guys now
as<00:05:53.969> I<00:05:54.479> said<00:05:54.659> I<00:05:54.690> put<00:05:54.870> that<00:05:55.050> link<00:05:55.229> up<00:05:55.440> at<00:05:55.620> the

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:55.800 
as I said I put that link up at the

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:57.559 
as I said I put that link up at the
start<00:05:56.039> for<00:05:56.130> the<00:05:56.370> first<00:05:56.610> version<00:05:57.030> of<00:05:57.120> this<00:05:57.270> trap

00:05:57.559 --> 00:05:57.569 
start for the first version of this trap

00:05:57.569 --> 00:05:59.390 
start for the first version of this trap
that<00:05:57.840> is<00:05:57.900> a<00:05:58.050> bit<00:05:58.229> easier<00:05:58.590> to<00:05:58.680> make<00:05:58.979> and<00:05:59.190> a<00:05:59.250> bit

00:05:59.390 --> 00:05:59.400 
that is a bit easier to make and a bit

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:01.370 
that is a bit easier to make and a bit
quicker<00:05:59.639> but<00:05:59.940> if<00:06:00.509> you're<00:06:00.659> really<00:06:00.900> going<00:06:01.139> for

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:01.380 
quicker but if you're really going for

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:03.680 
quicker but if you're really going for
maximum<00:06:01.590> loop<00:06:02.159> as<00:06:02.370> you<00:06:02.849> can<00:06:03.000> see<00:06:03.180> here<00:06:03.479> in<00:06:03.569> this

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:03.690 
maximum loop as you can see here in this

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:06.020 
maximum loop as you can see here in this
box<00:06:03.960> it's<00:06:04.289> pretty<00:06:04.590> quick<00:06:04.860> it<00:06:05.130> would<00:06:05.580> work<00:06:05.729> with

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:06.030 
box it's pretty quick it would work with

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:08.089 
box it's pretty quick it would work with
other<00:06:06.240> mob<00:06:06.479> traps<00:06:06.750> like<00:06:06.990> goldfish<00:06:07.800> and

jellyfish and stuff like that and it's a

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:13.070 
jellyfish and stuff like that and it's a
