00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
like a rubbery silicone I think that's

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.490 
like a rubbery silicone I think that's
pretty<00:00:44.340> cool<00:00:44.579> just<00:00:45.540> something<00:00:46.170> I<00:00:46.230> wanted<00:00:46.410> to

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
pretty cool just something I wanted to

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.549 
pretty cool just something I wanted to
bring<00:00:46.620> up<00:00:46.770> okay<00:00:46.980> so<00:00:47.040> we<00:00:47.160> have<00:00:47.280> two<00:00:47.430> eggs

00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:48.559 
bring up okay so we have two eggs

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:54.260 
bring up okay so we have two eggs
there's<00:00:49.559> a<00:00:49.649> water<00:00:50.250> and<00:00:51.739> both<00:00:52.760> the<00:00:53.760> mixing<00:00:54.239> of

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
there's a water and both the mixing of

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.660 
there's a water and both the mixing of
the<00:00:54.600> whip<00:00:54.809> and<00:00:55.170> instead<00:00:56.160> of<00:00:56.250> its<00:00:56.760> to<00:00:57.030> use<00:00:57.239> oil

00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:58.670 
the whip and instead of its to use oil

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:03.080 
the whip and instead of its to use oil

00:01:08.209 --> 00:01:08.219

the next segment okay next segment is

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:25.969 
the next segment okay next segment is
what<00:01:23.039> was<00:01:23.159> in<00:01:23.279> this<00:01:23.369> bag<00:01:23.579> was<00:01:24.709> this<00:01:25.709> little

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
what was in this bag was this little

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.050 
what was in this bag was this little
contraption<00:01:26.249> right<00:01:26.490> here<00:01:26.700> that's<00:01:26.850> for<00:01:26.969> the

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
contraption right here that's for the

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.469 
contraption right here that's for the
feeling<00:01:27.420> the<00:01:28.229> part<00:01:28.529> of<00:01:28.799> the<00:01:28.979> inside<00:01:29.399> mix<00:01:29.670> and

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
feeling the part of the inside mix and

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.359 
feeling the part of the inside mix and
there<00:01:31.049> was<00:01:31.139> another<00:01:31.319> bag<00:01:31.590> with<00:01:31.619> the<00:01:31.859> cake<00:01:32.039> mix

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
there was another bag with the cake mix

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:37.879 
there was another bag with the cake mix
so<00:01:32.579> we<00:01:32.700> basically<00:01:33.259> put<00:01:34.259> the<00:01:34.380> eggs<00:01:34.619> water<00:01:36.889> sauce

00:01:37.879 --> 00:01:37.889 
so we basically put the eggs water sauce

00:01:37.889 --> 00:01:41.239 
so we basically put the eggs water sauce
cake<00:01:38.520> mix<00:01:38.819> and<00:01:39.170> we<00:01:40.170> whisk<00:01:40.529> it<00:01:40.859> or<00:01:41.009> whatever

00:01:41.239 --> 00:01:41.249 
cake mix and we whisk it or whatever

00:01:41.249 --> 00:01:43.010 
cake mix and we whisk it or whatever
it's<00:01:41.340> called<00:01:41.369> and<00:01:42.149> then<00:01:42.689> now<00:01:42.810> we're<00:01:42.959> just

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
it's called and then now we're just

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.389 
it's called and then now we're just
gonna<00:01:43.170> fill<00:01:43.439> it<00:01:43.529> up<00:01:43.590> I<00:01:43.799> believe<00:01:44.130> it<00:01:44.219> says

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
gonna fill it up I believe it says

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:49.089 
gonna fill it up I believe it says
two-thirds<00:01:44.999> of<00:01:45.479> the<00:01:45.659> way<00:01:45.919> in<00:01:46.919> each<00:01:47.069> cup<00:01:47.369> and

00:01:49.089 --> 00:01:49.099 
two-thirds of the way in each cup and

00:01:49.099 --> 00:01:51.800 
two-thirds of the way in each cup and
that's<00:01:50.099> this<00:01:50.459> step<00:01:50.789> so<00:01:51.119> we'll<00:01:51.389> go<00:01:51.509> ahead<00:01:51.689> into

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
that's this step so we'll go ahead into

00:01:51.810 --> 00:02:02.590 
that's this step so we'll go ahead into
the<00:01:56.810> sea<00:01:57.810> about<00:01:57.929> that<00:01:58.109> much<00:01:58.259> with<00:01:58.439> her

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:02.600
