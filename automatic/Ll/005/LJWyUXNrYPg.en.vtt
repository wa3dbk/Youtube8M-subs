00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160 
anything because I don't know it to me

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.309 
anything because I don't know it to me
those<00:02:34.489> things<00:02:34.540> sometimes<00:02:35.540> they<00:02:35.690> make<00:02:36.019> sense

00:02:36.309 --> 00:02:36.319 
those things sometimes they make sense

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:38.800 
those things sometimes they make sense
but<00:02:36.620> they<00:02:36.799> rarely<00:02:37.209> kind<00:02:38.209> of<00:02:38.299> go<00:02:38.450> the<00:02:38.480> way<00:02:38.780> that

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
but they rarely kind of go the way that

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:42.160 
but they rarely kind of go the way that
I<00:02:39.079> think<00:02:39.980> they<00:02:40.130> will<00:02:40.340> or<00:02:40.549> should<00:02:40.720> not<00:02:41.720> really

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
I think they will or should not really

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:45.220 
I think they will or should not really
but<00:02:42.319> you<00:02:42.530> know<00:02:42.560> it's<00:02:42.769> kind<00:02:42.890> of<00:02:43.010> 5050<00:02:43.430> so<00:02:43.790> I<00:02:44.599> hope

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
but you know it's kind of 5050 so I hope

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:47.559
