00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
that my very first game with the m16 I

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.180 
that my very first game with the m16 I
do<00:00:39.000> some<00:00:39.870> well<00:00:40.140> this<00:00:40.170> isn't<00:00:40.440> an<00:00:40.620> amazing<00:00:41.010> game

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
do some well this isn't an amazing game

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.010 
do some well this isn't an amazing game
or<00:00:41.340> anything<00:00:41.640> but<00:00:41.820> it's<00:00:42.180> decent<00:00:42.750> enough<00:00:42.870> to

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
or anything but it's decent enough to

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.910 
or anything but it's decent enough to
upload<00:00:43.230> so<00:00:44.270> usually<00:00:45.270> what<00:00:46.020> I<00:00:46.079> expect<00:00:46.559> when<00:00:46.829> it

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
upload so usually what I expect when it

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.830 
upload so usually what I expect when it
comes<00:00:47.100> to<00:00:47.280> infinity<00:00:47.700> ward<00:00:47.910> call<00:00:48.120> duty<00:00:48.360> is<00:00:48.629> that

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840

that when it comes to call duty in

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.570 
that when it comes to call duty in
general<00:02:12.390> but<00:02:12.540> they<00:02:12.780> do

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
general but they do

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:15.370 
general but they do
something<00:02:14.240> that<00:02:14.360> does<00:02:14.510> kind<00:02:14.750> of<00:02:14.810> annoy<00:02:15.050> me<00:02:15.230> but

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
something that does kind of annoy me but

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:17.830 
something that does kind of annoy me but
either<00:02:15.650> way<00:02:15.890> I'm<00:02:16.790> here<00:02:17.180> playing<00:02:17.420> the<00:02:17.540> game<00:02:17.690> so

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:06.560 
ironically enough I do the same exact

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:08.650 
ironically enough I do the same exact
thing<00:05:06.740> when<00:05:06.890> I'm<00:05:07.010> talking<00:05:07.370> about<00:05:07.430> video<00:05:08.420> games

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:11.900 
and doing gameplay voiceovers I stumble

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:13.750 
and doing gameplay voiceovers I stumble
over<00:05:11.930> my<00:05:12.050> own<00:05:12.740> words<00:05:13.010> for<00:05:13.250> a<00:05:13.280> very<00:05:13.490> very<00:05:13.550> long

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:13.760 
over my own words for a very very long

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:16.390 
over my own words for a very very long
time<00:05:13.940> like<00:05:14.360> what<00:05:14.480> I<00:05:14.510> just<00:05:14.720> did<00:05:14.840> right<00:05:14.900> there<00:05:15.400> so

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:16.400 
time like what I just did right there so

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:17.410 
time like what I just did right there so
it<00:05:16.520> does<00:05:16.640> take<00:05:16.670> quite<00:05:16.940> a<00:05:17.030> while<00:05:17.090> to<00:05:17.210> actually

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:17.420 
it does take quite a while to actually

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:20.350 
it does take quite a while to actually
do<00:05:17.750> this<00:05:17.900> but<00:05:18.890> in<00:05:19.100> general<00:05:19.340> it<00:05:19.760> is<00:05:19.790> it's

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:20.360
