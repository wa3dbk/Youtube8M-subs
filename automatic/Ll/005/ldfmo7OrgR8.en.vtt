00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:06.480
 there was no plane woman 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.889
 friendly and smiling seemingly 

00:00:08.889 --> 00:00:11.430
 the profession requires passengers to 

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:12.849
 board was 

00:00:12.849 --> 00:00:15.329
 to make it easier to survive 

00:00:15.329 --> 00:00:16.689
 first of all the flight attendant 

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:18.369
 the sun is PR 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:19.160
 security 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.679
 Questions, that is, you need to do this 

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:23.570
 how to ensure that passengers do not even 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:24.579
 felt 

00:00:24.579 --> 00:00:26.809
 but a feeling of maximum comfort, we must 

00:00:26.809 --> 00:00:28.739
 reaching eldest son 

00:00:28.739 --> 00:00:30.549
 here should attract a special 

00:00:30.549 --> 00:00:32.990
 attention should just be nice to say 

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:35.180
 and maximum passenger comfort concerns 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:37.480
 security we do it try well 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.180
 as was seen as 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:42.130
 it's natural when we come on 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:44.270
 the plane first we check 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:45.340
 emergency rescue 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:46.310
 equipment 

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:47.290
 percent 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:49.160
 when preparing passengers this 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:50.010
 naturally 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.820
 i never fastened all u 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:53.690
 she was sounding earth 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:56.050
 emergency exit from work less i.e. 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:58.870
 this is the most important step 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:00:59.830
 flight attendants 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:02.050
 battery life 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:05.220
 Russian passengers immediately detained 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.320
 after the attack for a week 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.780
 but the paradox is that it is not important 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.850
 this is just the reason passengers attention 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:15.430
 quite difficult stage of the flight and unnecessary 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:16.580
 unrest on the desk 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:17.920
 completely useless 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.920
 They are topics St. Petersburg 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:29.110
 seemingly a short briefing that can 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:31.540
 be easier to listen to him is not always 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:34.950
 often just the next part 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:35.890
 hot for flight attendants 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:39.190
 cooking hot meals and 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:41.020
 deliver frozen 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:42.290
 the form then warms up 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:43.700
 specially electric furnaces like 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.119
 only the plane gain altitude is 

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:48.759
 already winning those terms in 13 

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:50.850
 minutes like a mosaic we must get ready 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.509
 sp service residents 

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:53.490
 passengers 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.840
 Today our business together with passengers 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:58.220
 class, respectively, they have 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:00.470
 Here is the surveillance that becoming 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:01.490
 aperitif 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:04.490
 alcoholic beverages 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.050
 soft drinks after that 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:10.219
 we will 

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:12.469
 offered to our passengers hotter 

00:02:12.469 --> 00:02:15.469
 food and so 

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:26.749
 in St. Petersburg connects to the network half 

00:02:26.749 --> 00:02:28.909
 liters 

00:02:28.909 --> 00:02:31.419
 boil out of water to brew 

00:02:31.419 --> 00:02:34.149
 tea coffee to synchronize 

00:02:34.149 --> 00:02:36.709
 much calmer in the cockpit was in 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:39.169
 limits to withstand heavy loads 

00:02:39.169 --> 00:02:42.279
 task type is just to control 

00:02:42.279 --> 00:02:45.279
 Recently, such examples in the early summer 

00:02:45.809 --> 00:02:48.059
 Kiev today headwind 

00:02:48.059 --> 00:02:49.509
 40 kilometers 

00:02:49.509 --> 00:02:52.179
 through the window of the car it resorted 

00:02:52.179 --> 00:02:55.559
 these funny 

00:02:55.559 --> 00:02:57.959
 but the plane has at least two blanks trained for 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:02:58.789
 declines 

00:02:58.789 --> 00:03:00.439
 another crucial stage 

00:03:00.439 --> 00:03:03.439
 for flight and for flight attendants 

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:07.609
 never appeared 

00:03:07.609 --> 00:03:10.609
 interlocutor of the agency 

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:15.199
 in local capital investment lead 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:21.900
 in the message afterwards 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.129
 but against passengers 

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:27.179
 naturally higher and in the Carpathians 

00:03:27.179 --> 00:03:29.499
 honestly tell you yes what are you 

00:03:29.499 --> 00:03:31.549
 they don't like him but 

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:33.489
 I want to say that the flow of passengers here 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:36.489
 I received my work here 

00:03:38.059 --> 00:03:39.839
 at this stage I feel my 

00:03:39.839 --> 00:03:41.759
 implementations ie when passengers 

00:03:41.759 --> 00:03:44.139
 go to reanimation with you thank you 

00:03:44.139 --> 00:03:45.549
 great motions 

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:46.719
 rise with such a feeling 

00:03:46.719 --> 00:03:49.120
 contribute to the hour 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:52.120
 statistics in china 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:54.439
 owed was 20 

00:03:54.439 --> 00:03:57.329
 well, just eat but you know what causes 

00:03:57.329 --> 00:03:59.579
 different emotions stay i more than once 

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:02.579
 I heard that for six years and flight attendants 

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:04.729
 smiles the most iskrin 

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:06.719
 if you take comparisons like foreign 

00:04:06.719 --> 00:04:09.719
 peasant games company is not real 

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:12.559
 landing in St. Petersburg three types it is only 

00:04:12.559 --> 00:04:13.599
 half GDP 

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:15.429
 ahead of the locomotive in Kazan 

00:04:15.429 --> 00:04:17.269
 became meeting passengers new 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:19.329
 newspapers again sultans 

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:22.329
 only heavenly scenery changes 

00:04:29.009 --> 00:04:32.009
 according to Gogol 

00:04:32.529 --> 00:04:34.499
 group of drugs for which means we 

00:04:34.499 --> 00:04:35.939
 required to do extra 

00:04:35.939 --> 00:04:37.959
 information about the procedure for now 

00:04:37.959 --> 00:04:39.729
 refused 

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:41.580
 the most expensive apartment is not yet 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:45.069
 they say 

00:04:45.069 --> 00:04:47.639
 at the initial stage 

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:50.860
 the escape 

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:53.830
 at a speed of 930 kilometers 

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:55.939
 overboard temperature 

00:04:55.939 --> 00:04:59.419
 54 degrees flight to Kazan Kazakhstan 

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:01.349
 get shorter and at least thank 

00:05:01.349 --> 00:05:03.110
 so as if perfectly 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:05.919
 unexpectedly changed our care 

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:07.569
 different from their dependence 

00:05:07.569 --> 00:05:09.870
 polar possessions of the night sky 

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:12.479
 working day is finished but even find 

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:15.020
 specifically do it 

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:17.620
 when we subscribe to post-Soviet time 

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:19.639
 you with an unusual see the principle that we 

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:20.650
 together 

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:23.910
 what is understanding 366 then
