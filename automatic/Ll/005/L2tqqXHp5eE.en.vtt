00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:16.470
 Let's go to this web class and see some commands. 

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:18.960
 well as sophisticated technologies that are 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:22.110
 powerpoint contest is there we go 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.529
 open the powerpoint and I'm on the slide 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:27.090
 number two and I want to open the presentation 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:29.880
 Do you remember the shortcut key? 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:34.410
 to start the slide show one 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:37.140
 from the beginning which command even this f5 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.480
 Then we're in the way to 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.620
 powerpoint presentation imagine that 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.250
 in the audience 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:47.820
 question came up the presenter wants to 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:51.510
 that invested slide one there appears a 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:56.160
 white screen you know which command the 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:59.039
 command to reveal and ara the earth to 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.289
 stay all white do you know any letters 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:03.799
 dry abcd 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:08.179
 You could kick the letter to 

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:12.329
 to clarify the presentation what do you think 

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:16.950
 that he lyrics are very well complete 

00:01:12.329 --> 00:01:21.590
 then one of the three is already true to 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:24.810
 letter c inserts a blank slide into 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:27.950
 It's a wonder if you tighten the 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:31.590
 slide now go to another key 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:34.229
 imagine that we are in a dark environment 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.450
 If a white screen appears, it will 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.740
 kind of weird environment will overshadow a 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.630
 little the eyes of those who are 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.389
 watching the presentation then it would be 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:45.689
 interesting to put a black screen on you 

00:01:42.389 --> 00:01:51.109
 know the command to make the screen 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:55.560
 black to lighten s 

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:57.419
 And then to be dark would be what 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.899
 the key that would be 

00:01:57.419 --> 00:02:03.749
 would it be the letter p to darken 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:10.259
 insert a black screen in the presentation 

00:02:03.749 --> 00:02:13.709
 do you think would be key is and 8b 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:17.690
 in fpm indicates and unknown 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:20.840
 let's go 12 leysin already 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:23.120
 It is really the key and when the 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:25.970
 a powerpoint presentation inserts the 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:30.050
 black slide then to insert a slide 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:33.590
 this is white and it is clear to be 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:36.380
 a black slide that is to darken the 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:41.030
 shortcut key is the letter 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:42.580
 and wonder so far so good 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:47.210
 the idea is not to follow the presentation 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:48.830
 slide 2 slide three imagine that the 

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:50.930
 presenter is a doctor is doing 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:52.340
 a lecture for children and in the square 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:55.100
 so many the speaker said so ah 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:57.950
 Stethoscope to a Child Question 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:03:00.920
 when I'm what you want you are cap ah 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:04.550
 ah ah ah ih ih or medical lecturer 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:06.350
 need to point out on the slide what is 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:08.590
 the stethoscope 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:13.160
 I ask will be that at power point 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:15.320
 have a laser tool is that speck 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:17.240
 as if it were that physical 

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:19.220
 even a laser pointer that the 

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:23.600
 powerpoint has this point feature 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:26.390
 laser has and you could tell me does 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:32.810
 it's the combinations that you need to do 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:36.950
 to appear this dot of law z has 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:38.900
 a dollar bill first needs that 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:41.480
 and this 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:44.050
 control that key would be in the 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:44.050
 keyboard 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:52.670
 I ask you by pressing the control key. 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:54.709
 which button you have to click 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:59.150
 the right left button 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:04:02.000
 I think it would left left questioned then 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:04.519
 the control key and pressing the 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:10.190
 main of the mouse usually the left 

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:12.200
 the laser dot appears beauty 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:14.300
 So let's make a mobilization, come on. 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:17.330
 do without so much walking there you look the 

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:19.250
 keyboard presses the control key and 

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:22.419
 the leftmost mouse button 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:28.240
 and goes so much so slowly they sing do 

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:28.240
 whatever 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:38.270
 and again you will do what key 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:45.830
 same important meeting that will not 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:48.800
 so then both to appear the 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:51.440
 The law is the combination of control 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:55.640
 with the main button of the mouse the button 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:57.320
 both left will incur a hug tapir 

00:04:55.640 --> 00:05:01.340
