00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:12.179
 welcome back back today it's about 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.009
 Measure the topic of body fat 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:17.010
 how do you best get your body fat 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:19.590
 measure and I would compare to that 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.630
 point the best method to be body fit 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.689
 to measure is with a so-called cap 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.769
 caliper or caliber that is 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.900
 so be an art 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:30.510
 With that you can make the skin the thicker 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:33.660
 Measure skin fold by simply placing it 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.280
 at certain points, the skin is up 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.860
 pulls or after you can to this pliers 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.420
 Measure ok vidic is the skin fold one 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.890
 write down the results and ever 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.300
 After how many folds are measured 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.460
 There are different methods 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.200
 which one wears a formula 1 and the 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.690
 then calculate simply because body 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.070
 fat the formulas are available in 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.440
 You can just google internet 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.530
 you should get such a thing and 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:58.140
 The result is actually pretty accurate 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.850
 So that means if you know what exactly 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.770
 I want to have such a caliber 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:06.900
 they are not expensive or very, very 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:12.510
 cheap I say so from 20 euro plus 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:15.390
 minus, however 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.070
 the only disadvantage is of course 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.830
 does not necessarily buy just buy 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.549
 you need a lot for it 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.860
 exercise 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:26.610
 you have to be very good with it 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:29.220
 busy because yes you have to 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.320
 handle it very sensitively yes and 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.869
 Practice a lot with it until you really do 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:37.110
 then this shoot out has how exactly 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:39.450
 where to pull and how to fold the skin 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.460
 stops and so on and so forth 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.560
 I 've been around for a couple of years 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.290
 bought times wanted to look 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.030
 knew it wanted to measure 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.390
 not that, of course, that time is not 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.380
 just easy to handle it 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:53.790
 of course it can always learn so is 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.180
 now no mega thing but as I said 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.750
 do a bit of exercise and 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:59.700
 accordingly, of course, was the 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.140
 results quite inaccurate respectively 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.560
 came out very funny results 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.689
 may have measured the first time must 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:07.119
 get out and I always have it 

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:08.800
 still left I do not know of 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:10.959
 I is I do have the in 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:13.330
 lost solution anyway 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:14.560
 cheapest best method rotation due 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.069
 and of course you can do it on everyone 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:19.720
 very good with a bit of exercise 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:22.239
 measuring your body fat content is too 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:24.130
 the only one thing with the 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:25.750
 that make all the bodybuilders 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:27.489
 who used even if they unding 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.260
 want to see the show ok in the competition 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:30.610
 clear up the competition phase how much 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.080
 Body fat you still have how much you need 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:33.870
 still gone and so on and so forth 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:36.100
 Of course there are others 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.730
 possibilities his body fat to 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:39.220
 measure up 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:41.350
 the longest variant is this whole 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:42.690
 body fat dares you also outside 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:45.340
 can buy 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:48.370
 However, it is the cheaper it is 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:52.450
 Ding is the worse so yes 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:55.380
 from 15 euros to otherwise 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:57.870
 a lot of these things cost a lot and 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:00.819
 accordingly, of course, the results 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:02.200
 even the very expensive ones 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:05.380
 some fitness have there too 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:07.359
 special cars then measure how 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:10.260
 I have a lot of muscles on my right arm 

00:03:07.359 --> 00:03:13.450
 in the left arm and how much water and 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:17.049
 bones and guts what do I know what there 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:18.120
 everything else is so analyze 

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:20.049
 everything is very good 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:22.000
 but unfortunately I have there too 

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:24.069
 determined experience and its 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.519
 the costs dare several thousands 

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:29.799
 euros that they still partially 

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:31.480
 not exactly he plays too 

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:32.950
 again when I measure like 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:35.290
 much clock what have I eaten before 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:36.310
 maybe I trained before and 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:39.100
 and so on 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:40.870
 So I use it sometimes now and then 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:42.250
 but more so the procedure to one 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:43.959
 little to see if you would what 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:45.730
 get out of here now what does this dare say 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:47.079
 but I do not really take that seriously 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:49.209
 such a meanwhile do not do so yet 

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:51.639
 really much thoughts as well as mine 

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:54.670
 Body fat percentage is I do that 

00:03:51.639 --> 00:03:57.069
 example always so that i exist it like that 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:58.780
 a picture of what I have where different 

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:00.220
 Body fat types are I think I am 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:02.410
 Just a report 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:04.180
 tell us a little bit and open up here 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:06.549
 then you can see this picture then I see 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:08.290
 just ok where am i about to know 

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:09.220
 then that about me then about on 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:11.019
 this was with this body 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:12.689
 am fat and then it is also in 

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:14.220
 order 

00:04:12.689 --> 00:04:16.620
 otherwise 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:18.269
 other variants are available in the 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:19.799
 You can evaluate the internet somehow 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:22.800
 enter weight and any 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:24.510
 in my opinion yes then 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.920
 I can also go to the fortune teller equal 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:27.600
 with a glass ball there you can 

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:29.810
 probably also the same value out 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:33.840
 we should bring the whole other there 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:34.310
 supposedly a sold or something 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.390
 always 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:37.710
 So as I said there are many 

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:39.240
 possibilities most are very 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:41.300
 inaccurate if he is really accurate 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:43.320
 wanna know buy jonker lipper 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:44.850
 try it a bit and then 

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:47.670
 you will be very good in any case 

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:49.020
 Part of body fat can be measured if 

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:50.760
 it does not matter to anybody 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:52.020
 plays I do not know what for now 

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:53.970
 Should I play a role now? 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:54.740
 twelve or fourteen is actually 

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:56.940
 no matter 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:58.980
 but otherwise it was mine 

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:00.480
 short on this topic is often asked 

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:02.640
 we will now also with body fat 

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:04.800
 How can I buy the measure or buy 

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:05.669
 a caliber carries with it and then be 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:07.500
 we know it too 

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:10.530
 otherwise everything else is only one 

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:12.180
 a bit spongy and I'm talking now 

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:13.500
 the things you can afford 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:14.940
 Of course you can do any unis 

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:17.340
 go universities then there is 

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:18.630
 so also other methods on the world 

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:21.080
 but do not enter now because for otto 

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:22.860
 normal consumers are relevant and 

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:26.810
 not significant 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:26.810
 what are you doing to me soon
