single ingredient that every time you

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.889 
single ingredient that every time you
take<00:00:48.660> a<00:00:48.690> spoonful<00:00:49.940> the<00:00:50.940> next<00:00:51.239> step<00:00:51.420> is<00:00:51.750> to

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
take a spoonful the next step is to

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.689 
take a spoonful the next step is to
remove<00:00:52.020> all<00:00:52.379> the<00:00:52.530> water<00:00:52.710> and<00:00:52.980> the<00:00:53.190> seeds<00:00:53.430> from

remove all the water and the seeds from
the<00:00:53.879> tomatoes<00:00:54.329> reason<00:00:54.899> being<00:00:55.079> is<00:00:55.260> that<00:00:55.289> if<00:00:55.530> you

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
the tomatoes reason being is that if you

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.650 
the tomatoes reason being is that if you
don't<00:00:55.800> the<00:00:56.340> quinoa<00:00:56.579> will<00:00:56.910> soak<00:00:57.149> up<00:00:57.300> all<00:00:57.510> the
