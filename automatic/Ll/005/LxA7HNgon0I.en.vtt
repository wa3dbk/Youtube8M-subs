ago I think almost like a two weeks ago
or<00:00:11.670> maybe<00:00:12.120> like<00:00:12.360> we<00:00:12.509> could<00:00:12.660> go<00:00:12.750> but<00:00:12.960> anyway

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
or maybe like we could go but anyway

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:14.990

really cool gay but I couldn't really
play<00:00:15.330> it<00:00:15.630> because<00:00:16.320> i<00:00:16.500> have<00:00:16.770> a<00:00:16.800> mac<00:00:17.270> but<00:00:18.270> then<00:00:18.779> i

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
play it because i have a mac but then i

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.330 
play it because i have a mac but then i
remembered<00:00:19.140> that<00:00:19.170> on<00:00:19.410> live<00:00:19.650> actually<00:00:20.039> offers

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
remembered that on live actually offers

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:21.740 
remembered that on live actually offers
it<00:00:20.490> so<00:00:20.609> i<00:00:20.640> figured<00:00:20.970> i'll<00:00:21.090> make<00:00:21.240> this<00:00:21.330> video<00:00:21.570> for

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
it so i figured i'll make this video for

it so i figured i'll make this video for
you<00:00:22.020> guys<00:00:22.080> to<00:00:22.320> see<00:00:22.500> how<00:00:22.650> well<00:00:22.800> it<00:00:22.859> works<00:00:23.100> in<00:00:23.220> on

you guys to see how well it works in on

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.730 
you guys to see how well it works in on
live<00:00:23.840> whether<00:00:24.840> it's<00:00:25.050> worth<00:00:25.230> getting<00:00:25.439> it<00:00:25.650> or

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
live whether it's worth getting it or

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.460 
live whether it's worth getting it or
not<00:00:25.890> you<00:00:26.070> can<00:00:26.189> decide<00:00:26.490> but<00:00:26.820> i<00:00:26.880> think<00:00:27.260> it<00:00:28.260> works

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
that do happen once in a while but maybe

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.640 
that do happen once in a while but maybe
it's<00:01:18.270> only<00:01:18.450> of<00:01:18.509> the<00:01:18.600> mac<00:01:18.780> version<00:01:18.810> or<00:01:19.320> whatever

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650

they're disappointed with this game but
I<00:02:03.460> think<00:02:04.460> it's<00:02:04.580> just<00:02:04.610> because<00:02:04.790> it's<00:02:04.910> so<00:02:05.120> hard

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:05.330 
I think it's just because it's so hard

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:07.630 
I think it's just because it's so hard
to<00:02:05.390> the<00:02:05.570> live<00:02:05.750> to<00:02:05.900> the<00:02:06.020> expectations<00:02:06.860> up<00:02:07.430> from
