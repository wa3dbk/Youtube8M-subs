bedroom and then I moved it here and I

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:16.979 
bedroom and then I moved it here and I
just<00:03:15.489> found<00:03:15.760> it<00:03:15.880> works<00:03:16.030> better<00:03:16.269> in<00:03:16.420> my<00:03:16.510> closet

00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:16.989 
just found it works better in my closet

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:19.890 
just found it works better in my closet
and<00:03:17.170> then<00:03:17.769> I<00:03:17.799> ended<00:03:18.100> up<00:03:18.250> adding<00:03:18.459> on<00:03:18.820> this<00:03:19.269> three

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 
and then I ended up adding on this three

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:22.920 
and then I ended up adding on this three
square<00:03:20.560> one<00:03:20.769> for<00:03:21.220> more<00:03:21.610> clothes<00:03:21.940> and<00:03:22.690> then<00:03:22.840> we

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:22.930 
square one for more clothes and then we

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:24.420 
square one for more clothes and then we
even<00:03:23.110> have<00:03:23.320> some<00:03:23.500> clothes<00:03:23.799> just<00:03:23.950> folded<00:03:24.340> on

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
even have some clothes just folded on

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:26.070 
even have some clothes just folded on
the<00:03:24.459> top<00:03:24.760> because<00:03:24.940> I'm<00:03:25.209> running<00:03:25.480> out<00:03:25.720> of<00:03:25.780> room

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:26.080 
the top because I'm running out of room

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:27.930 
the top because I'm running out of room
and<00:03:26.350> that<00:03:27.070> probably<00:03:27.310> means<00:03:27.459> I<00:03:27.700> should<00:03:27.880> go

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:27.940 
and that probably means I should go

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:29.370 
and that probably means I should go
through<00:03:27.970> my<00:03:28.330> clothes<00:03:28.570> and<00:03:28.840> get<00:03:29.019> rid<00:03:29.170> of<00:03:29.260> a

works<00:03:32.440> for<00:03:32.590> me<00:03:32.830> right<00:03:32.950> now

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:33.670 
works for me right now

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:36.120
