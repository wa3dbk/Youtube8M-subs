00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:15.680 
pioneer log cabin I'm going to talk
about<00:00:14.370> a<00:00:14.490> little<00:00:14.730> bit<00:00:14.849> about<00:00:15.269> how<00:00:15.540> its

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
about a little bit about how its

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.599 
about a little bit about how its
constructed<00:00:15.960> and<00:00:16.740> we're<00:00:17.130> going<00:00:17.250> to<00:00:17.310> go<00:00:17.460> inside

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
constructed and we're going to go inside

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.310 
constructed and we're going to go inside
and<00:00:17.970> take<00:00:18.060> a<00:00:18.119> little<00:00:18.359> quick<00:00:18.750> little<00:00:19.020> tour<00:00:19.230> of

and take a little quick little tour of

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:28.910 
and take a little quick little tour of
it<00:00:19.529> so<00:00:20.100> come<00:00:20.880> join<00:00:21.060> me<00:00:21.270> and

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.890 

when<00:00:29.490> we<00:00:29.640> go<00:00:29.730> into<00:00:29.939> the<00:00:30.119> cabinet<00:00:30.510> today<00:00:30.660> I'd

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
when we go into the cabinet today I'd

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.139 
when we go into the cabinet today I'd
like<00:00:30.930> to<00:00:31.080> I<00:00:31.560> brought<00:00:32.009> along<00:00:32.130> some<00:00:32.279> tools<00:00:32.700> that

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
like to I brought along some tools that

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.780 
like to I brought along some tools that
the<00:00:33.300> Pioneers<00:00:33.510> would<00:00:33.930> use<00:00:34.200> to<00:00:34.829> construct<00:00:35.640> the

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
the Pioneers would use to construct the

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.189 
the Pioneers would use to construct the
log<00:00:35.970> cabin<00:00:36.239> so<00:00:36.420> we're<00:00:36.540> going<00:00:36.660> to<00:00:36.720> go<00:00:36.840> over<00:00:36.870> some

00:00:37.189 --> 00:00:37.199 
log cabin so we're going to go over some

00:00:37.199 --> 00:00:40.069 
log cabin so we're going to go over some
of<00:00:37.320> those<00:00:37.410> tools<00:00:37.879> right<00:00:38.879> now<00:00:38.910> before<00:00:39.720> we<00:00:39.989> get

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
of those tools right now before we get

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:41.689 
of those tools right now before we get
started<00:00:40.350> I'd<00:00:40.770> like<00:00:40.829> you<00:00:41.070> to<00:00:41.129> take<00:00:41.309> a<00:00:41.340> look<00:00:41.520> at

00:00:41.689 --> 00:00:41.699 
started I'd like you to take a look at

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:44.389 
started I'd like you to take a look at
how<00:00:42.540> this<00:00:42.750> log<00:00:43.199> cabin<00:00:43.230> is<00:00:43.710> constructed

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
how this log cabin is constructed

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.090 
how this log cabin is constructed
basically<00:00:45.330> its<00:00:45.629> logs<00:00:46.140> are<00:00:46.410> onto<00:00:46.589> the<00:00:46.710> top<00:00:46.920> of

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
basically its logs are onto the top of

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.810 
basically its logs are onto the top of
logs<00:00:47.339> and<00:00:47.820> how<00:00:48.420> they're<00:00:49.070> NOS<00:00:50.070> together<00:00:50.489> is<00:00:50.670> by

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
logs and how they're NOS together is by

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.850 
logs and how they're NOS together is by
saddle<00:00:51.269> notch<00:00:51.390> and<00:00:51.600> kind<00:00:51.750> of<00:00:51.809> like<00:00:51.900> a<00:00:51.930> saddle

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
saddle notch and kind of like a saddle

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.729 
saddle notch and kind of like a saddle
is<00:00:52.949> on<00:00:53.129> a<00:00:53.159> horse<00:00:53.870> that's<00:00:54.870> the<00:00:54.960> shape<00:00:55.260> that's<00:00:55.530> in

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
is on a horse that's the shape that's in

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.790 
is on a horse that's the shape that's in
each<00:00:56.010> each<00:00:56.670> one<00:00:57.360> of<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:57.570> lower<00:00:58.170> logs<00:00:58.470> and<00:00:58.680> then

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
each each one of the lower logs and then

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.729 
each each one of the lower logs and then
the<00:00:58.920> top<00:00:59.190> log<00:00:59.430> is<00:00:59.610> sent<00:00:59.879> into<00:01:00.059> that<00:01:00.360> saddle<00:01:00.780> and

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
the top log is sent into that saddle and

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.860 
the top log is sent into that saddle and
then<00:01:02.190> after<00:01:02.579> the<00:01:02.699> logs<00:01:02.910> are<00:01:03.090> set<00:01:03.300> in<00:01:03.449> they<00:01:03.809> are

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
then after the logs are set in they are

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.190 
then after the logs are set in they are
usually<00:01:04.530> chinked<00:01:05.039> with<00:01:05.160> some<00:01:05.369> type<00:01:05.550> of<00:01:05.580> mud

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:06.200 
usually chinked with some type of mud

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.010 
usually chinked with some type of mud
clay<00:01:07.200> and<00:01:07.590> then<00:01:08.340> on<00:01:08.910> the<00:01:09.060> inside<00:01:09.210> times

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
clay and then on the inside times

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.650 
clay and then on the inside times
there's<00:01:10.229> chunks<00:01:10.979> of<00:01:11.100> wood<00:01:11.310> put<00:01:12.060> in<00:01:12.210> the<00:01:12.300> inside

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:12.660 
there's chunks of wood put in the inside

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:15.980 
there's chunks of wood put in the inside
so<00:01:12.930> I<00:01:13.710> have<00:01:14.190> a<00:01:14.220> number<00:01:14.550> of<00:01:14.640> tools<00:01:14.970> here<00:01:15.360> today

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
so I have a number of tools here today

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.999 
so I have a number of tools here today
that<00:01:16.229> I<00:01:16.259> like<00:01:16.500> to<00:01:16.619> quickly<00:01:17.610> go<00:01:17.910> over<00:01:19.009> quickly

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
that I like to quickly go over quickly

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.550 
that I like to quickly go over quickly
go<00:01:20.280> over<00:01:20.310> how<00:01:20.789> the<00:01:20.850> Pioneers<00:01:21.810> would<00:01:22.140> use<00:01:22.350> them

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
go over how the Pioneers would use them

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.180 
go over how the Pioneers would use them
and<00:01:22.679> why<00:01:23.130> they<00:01:23.310> brought<00:01:23.490> them<00:01:24.350> to<00:01:25.350> the<00:01:25.590> new<00:01:25.710> to

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:26.190 
and why they brought them to the new to

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:30.800 
and why they brought them to the new to
the<00:01:26.369> to<00:01:26.940> the<00:01:27.090> new<00:01:27.509> oregon<00:01:27.899> country<00:01:28.020> so<00:01:29.810> first

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
the to the new oregon country so first

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.870 
the to the new oregon country so first
of<00:01:30.960> all<00:01:31.080> we<00:01:31.200> have<00:01:31.380> a<00:01:31.679> generally<00:01:32.640> they<00:01:32.759> would

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
of all we have a generally they would

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.190 
of all we have a generally they would
take<00:01:33.060> us<00:01:33.210> at<00:01:33.329> what's<00:01:33.509> called<00:01:33.689> a<00:01:33.750> felling<00:01:34.049> axe

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
take us at what's called a felling axe

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.289 
take us at what's called a felling axe
and<00:01:34.380> they<00:01:34.439> would<00:01:34.560> follow<00:01:35.009> the<00:01:35.220> tree<00:01:35.460> and<00:01:35.700> then

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
and they would follow the tree and then

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:37.670 
and they would follow the tree and then
they<00:01:36.479> would<00:01:36.630> they<00:01:36.930> would<00:01:37.049> buck<00:01:37.259> it<00:01:37.409> up<00:01:37.470> with<00:01:37.650> a

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
they would they would buck it up with a

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.950 
they would they would buck it up with a
saw<00:01:37.979> and<00:01:38.340> i<00:01:38.430> have<00:01:38.610> what's<00:01:39.180> called<00:01:39.360> the<00:01:39.479> one-man

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
saw and i have what's called the one-man

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.160 
saw and i have what's called the one-man
saw<00:01:40.290> here<00:01:40.759> they<00:01:41.759> would<00:01:41.880> also<00:01:42.119> used<00:01:42.329> to<00:01:42.960> band

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
saw here they would also used to band

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.889 
saw here they would also used to band
saws<00:01:43.470> but<00:01:44.430> this<00:01:44.759> works<00:01:45.000> if<00:01:45.149> you<00:01:45.240> just<00:01:45.390> want

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
saws but this works if you just want

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.899 
saws but this works if you just want
basically<00:01:46.200> one<00:01:46.380> person<00:01:46.409> means<00:01:47.310> to<00:01:47.460> operate<00:01:47.790> it

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
basically one person means to operate it

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:51.980 
basically one person means to operate it
and<00:01:48.090> then<00:01:48.680> after<00:01:49.680> they<00:01:49.799> had<00:01:50.420> cut<00:01:51.420> the<00:01:51.540> logs<00:01:51.750> to

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
and then after they had cut the logs to

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.440 
and then after they had cut the logs to
length<00:01:52.259> they<00:01:52.950> would<00:01:53.159> go<00:01:53.700> back<00:01:53.729> and<00:01:53.909> make<00:01:54.270> the

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
length they would go back and make the

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:55.700 
length they would go back and make the
notching<00:01:54.899> and<00:01:55.049> you<00:01:55.110> can<00:01:55.259> do<00:01:55.380> this<00:01:55.560> by

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
notching and you can do this by

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.609 
notching and you can do this by
basically<00:01:56.220> using<00:01:56.520> the<00:01:56.610> one-man<00:01:56.880> saw<00:01:57.119> and

00:01:57.609 --> 00:01:57.619 
basically using the one-man saw and

00:01:57.619 --> 00:01:59.690 
basically using the one-man saw and
sawing<00:01:58.619> it<00:01:58.829> in<00:01:58.950> several<00:01:59.130> places<00:01:59.369> in<00:01:59.670> that

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
sawing it in several places in that

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.700 
sawing it in several places in that
saddle<00:02:00.240> notch<00:02:00.360> and<00:02:00.540> then<00:02:00.689> coming<00:02:00.960> back<00:02:00.990> with<00:02:01.680> a

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
saddle notch and then coming back with a

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.069 
saddle notch and then coming back with a
small<00:02:02.009> hatchet<00:02:02.250> our<00:02:02.549> hand<00:02:02.850> hand<00:02:03.570> axe<00:02:03.869> and

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
small hatchet our hand hand axe and

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:08.150 
small hatchet our hand hand axe and
chopping<00:02:04.649> chopping<00:02:04.799> that<00:02:05.610> out<00:02:07.160> that's

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
chopping chopping that out that's

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.100 
chopping chopping that out that's
basically<00:02:08.459> how<00:02:08.640> they<00:02:08.850> would<00:02:08.970> put<00:02:09.630> the<00:02:09.750> logs

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
basically how they would put the logs

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.560 
basically how they would put the logs
together<00:02:10.530> as<00:02:10.709> a<00:02:10.739> settlement<00:02:11.670> launching<00:02:12.329> here

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:12.570 
together as a settlement launching here

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:14.630 
together as a settlement launching here
in<00:02:13.079> order<00:02:13.290> there's<00:02:13.530> lots<00:02:14.190> of<00:02:14.310> different

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
in order there's lots of different

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.220 
in order there's lots of different
techniques<00:02:14.970> that<00:02:15.239> they<00:02:15.329> would<00:02:15.480> use<00:02:15.660> but<00:02:15.840> the

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
techniques that they would use but the

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:17.870 
techniques that they would use but the
one<00:02:16.380> we<00:02:16.530> used<00:02:16.739> for<00:02:17.010> building<00:02:17.250> this<00:02:17.340> cabin<00:02:17.730> was

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
one we used for building this cabin was

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.880 
one we used for building this cabin was
the<00:02:18.090> basic<00:02:18.420> saddle<00:02:18.750> notch<00:02:18.870> which<00:02:19.140> it's<00:02:19.739> pretty

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
the basic saddle notch which it's pretty

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:21.830 
the basic saddle notch which it's pretty
easy<00:02:20.100> if<00:02:20.700> you<00:02:20.820> look<00:02:20.970> at<00:02:21.060> the<00:02:21.180> size<00:02:21.450> of<00:02:21.750> these

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
easy if you look at the size of these

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.610 
easy if you look at the size of these
logs<00:02:22.190> we<00:02:23.190> tried<00:02:23.400> to<00:02:23.519> get<00:02:23.640> logs<00:02:23.880> that<00:02:24.239> were<00:02:24.620> that

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
logs we tried to get logs that were that

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.530 
logs we tried to get logs that were that
you<00:02:25.709> could<00:02:25.859> manage<00:02:26.130> with<00:02:26.310> just<00:02:26.549> a<00:02:26.880> few<00:02:27.060> people

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
you could manage with just a few people

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:32.399 
you could manage with just a few people
and<00:02:28.629> maybe<00:02:29.610> team<00:02:30.610> of<00:02:30.730> horses<00:02:30.879> or<00:02:31.299> or<00:02:32.140> some

00:02:32.399 --> 00:02:32.409 
and maybe team of horses or or some

00:02:32.409 --> 00:02:34.500 
and maybe team of horses or or some
other<00:02:32.530> livestock<00:02:32.769> to<00:02:33.250> to<00:02:33.579> use<00:02:33.730> to<00:02:33.939> raise<00:02:34.180> logs

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
other livestock to to use to raise logs

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:36.990 
other livestock to to use to raise logs
as<00:02:34.719> each<00:02:34.959> as<00:02:35.829> you<00:02:36.069> get<00:02:36.219> higher<00:02:36.400> and<00:02:36.579> higher<00:02:36.640> it

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
as each as you get higher and higher it

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.740 
as each as you get higher and higher it
gets<00:02:37.090> harder<00:02:37.510> to<00:02:37.540> to<00:02:38.230> put<00:02:38.469> a<00:02:38.500> heavy<00:02:38.799> log<00:02:39.629> on<00:02:40.629> the

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
gets harder to to put a heavy log on the

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.349 
gets harder to to put a heavy log on the
top<00:02:40.959> so<00:02:41.349> what<00:02:41.829> we<00:02:41.980> did<00:02:42.159> is<00:02:42.250> we<00:02:42.280> we<00:02:42.819> used<00:02:43.000> rails

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:43.359 
top so what we did is we we used rails

00:02:43.359 --> 00:02:45.899 
top so what we did is we we used rails
rail<00:02:44.079> system<00:02:44.560> kind<00:02:45.099> of<00:02:45.129> rail<00:02:45.280> sticking<00:02:45.670> out<00:02:45.790> we

00:02:45.899 --> 00:02:45.909 
rail system kind of rail sticking out we

00:02:45.909 --> 00:02:47.970 
rail system kind of rail sticking out we
roll<00:02:46.150> the<00:02:46.329> logs<00:02:46.540> up<00:02:46.720> with<00:02:46.840> ropes<00:02:47.109> and<00:02:47.349> then<00:02:47.769> put

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
roll the logs up with ropes and then put

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:51.449 
roll the logs up with ropes and then put
them<00:02:48.099> up<00:02:48.189> onto<00:02:48.430> the<00:02:48.640> top<00:02:48.970> but<00:02:49.629> you<00:02:50.310> got<00:02:51.310> to

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:51.459 
them up onto the top but you got to

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:52.949 
them up onto the top but you got to
remember<00:02:51.670> that<00:02:51.909> these<00:02:52.060> structures<00:02:52.540> were<00:02:52.720> only

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:52.959 
remember that these structures were only

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:55.379 
remember that these structures were only
used<00:02:53.319> by<00:02:53.650> pioneers<00:02:54.340> for<00:02:54.489> the<00:02:54.609> first<00:02:54.849> few<00:02:55.359> years

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:55.389 
used by pioneers for the first few years

00:02:55.389 --> 00:02:57.869 
used by pioneers for the first few years
in<00:02:55.840> work<00:02:55.989> places<00:02:56.980> we're<00:02:57.189> gonna<00:02:57.280> live<00:02:57.549> in<00:02:57.579> for<00:02:57.849> a

00:02:57.869 --> 00:02:57.879 
in work places we're gonna live in for a

00:02:57.879 --> 00:02:59.610 
in work places we're gonna live in for a
very<00:02:58.060> long<00:02:58.239> time<00:02:58.269> a<00:02:58.750> lot<00:02:58.930> of<00:02:58.989> these<00:02:59.049> times<00:02:59.319> a

00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.620 
very long time a lot of these times a

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:02.580 
very long time a lot of these times a
lot<00:03:00.310> of<00:03:00.370> times<00:03:00.609> later<00:03:01.090> later<00:03:01.659> on<00:03:02.049> they<00:03:02.409> even

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
lot of times later later on they even

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.490 
lot of times later later on they even
put<00:03:03.750> clapboards<00:03:04.750> on<00:03:04.870> the<00:03:05.019> side<00:03:05.170> to<00:03:05.349> make<00:03:05.379> it

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
put clapboards on the side to make it

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:06.960 
put clapboards on the side to make it
more<00:03:05.680> look<00:03:05.859> more<00:03:06.069> like<00:03:06.220> a<00:03:06.250> house<00:03:06.459> or<00:03:06.760> they

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:06.970 
more look more like a house or they

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:08.490 
more look more like a house or they
would<00:03:07.120> just<00:03:07.239> use<00:03:07.419> this<00:03:07.510> as<00:03:07.720> an<00:03:07.870> outbuilding<00:03:08.230> a

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:08.500 
would just use this as an outbuilding a

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.190 
would just use this as an outbuilding a
chicken<00:03:08.769> coop<00:03:08.919> or<00:03:09.189> a<00:03:09.220> barn<00:03:09.519> or<00:03:09.849> something<00:03:10.299> for

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 
chicken coop or a barn or something for

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.619 
chicken coop or a barn or something for
that<00:03:11.290> effect<00:03:11.590> a<00:03:12.400> few<00:03:13.000> other<00:03:13.120> tools<00:03:13.299> that<00:03:13.540> I

00:03:13.619 --> 00:03:13.629 
that effect a few other tools that I

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:15.899 
that effect a few other tools that I
have<00:03:13.810> here<00:03:14.139> all<00:03:15.010> these<00:03:15.220> logs<00:03:15.459> had<00:03:15.730> to<00:03:15.790> be

00:03:15.899 --> 00:03:15.909 
have here all these logs had to be

00:03:15.909 --> 00:03:17.909 
have here all these logs had to be
peeled<00:03:16.299> so<00:03:16.930> they<00:03:17.049> bring<00:03:17.319> with<00:03:17.439> them<00:03:17.560> a<00:03:17.680> draw

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:17.919 
peeled so they bring with them a draw

00:03:17.919 --> 00:03:20.699 
peeled so they bring with them a draw
knife<00:03:18.750> basically<00:03:19.750> use<00:03:19.989> this<00:03:20.139> by<00:03:20.349> sitting<00:03:20.620> it

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:20.709 
knife basically use this by sitting it

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:22.860 
knife basically use this by sitting it
on<00:03:20.829> the<00:03:20.950> log<00:03:21.129> and<00:03:21.370> peeling<00:03:21.730> the<00:03:21.849> bark<00:03:22.000> off<00:03:22.269> you

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:22.870 
on the log and peeling the bark off you

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:24.690 
on the log and peeling the bark off you
need<00:03:22.959> to<00:03:23.079> peel<00:03:23.319> the<00:03:23.470> bark<00:03:23.680> off<00:03:23.919> because<00:03:24.459> it

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:24.700 
need to peel the bark off because it

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:27.390 
need to peel the bark off because it
prevents<00:03:25.209> the<00:03:25.470> Beals<00:03:26.470> and<00:03:26.739> other<00:03:26.829> bugs<00:03:27.129> from

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 
prevents the Beals and other bugs from

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:28.920 
prevents the Beals and other bugs from
getting<00:03:27.489> in<00:03:27.790> there<00:03:27.939> and<00:03:28.209> then<00:03:28.389> rotting<00:03:28.810> the

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:28.930 
getting in there and then rotting the

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:32.990 
getting in there and then rotting the
wood<00:03:29.819> so<00:03:30.819> this<00:03:30.970> is<00:03:31.090> the<00:03:31.239> draw<00:03:31.419> knife<00:03:31.659> and<00:03:32.049> then

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
wood so this is the draw knife and then

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.710 
wood so this is the draw knife and then
on<00:03:34.000> the<00:03:34.150> roof

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:34.720 
on the roof

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:36.649 
on the roof
you<00:03:35.229> of<00:03:35.409> course<00:03:35.560> you<00:03:35.769> need<00:03:35.979> some<00:03:36.040> type<00:03:36.340> of

00:03:36.649 --> 00:03:36.659 
you of course you need some type of

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:38.610 
you of course you need some type of
shingles<00:03:37.659> so<00:03:37.840> they<00:03:37.959> would<00:03:38.109> split<00:03:38.290> their<00:03:38.530> own

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:38.620 
shingles so they would split their own

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:40.819 
shingles so they would split their own
shingles<00:03:39.099> and<00:03:39.250> they<00:03:39.699> would<00:03:39.849> bring<00:03:40.060> with<00:03:40.239> them

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:40.829 
shingles and they would bring with them

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:44.909 
shingles and they would bring with them
what's<00:03:41.829> called<00:03:42.099> a<00:03:42.370> throw<00:03:43.060> and<00:03:43.590> you<00:03:44.590> would<00:03:44.709> make

what's called a throw and you would make
your<00:03:45.040> own<00:03:45.099> mallet<00:03:45.639> this<00:03:45.790> one's<00:03:46.000> made<00:03:46.209> out<00:03:46.329> of

00:03:46.469 --> 00:03:46.479 
your own mallet this one's made out of

00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:48.360 
your own mallet this one's made out of
ash<00:03:46.720> and<00:03:47.019> you<00:03:47.049> would<00:03:47.199> basically<00:03:47.409> put<00:03:47.799> this<00:03:48.190> in

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:48.370 
ash and you would basically put this in

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:52.559 
ash and you would basically put this in
a<00:03:48.639> round<00:03:49.030> of<00:03:49.269> cedar<00:03:50.400> cedar<00:03:51.400> it's<00:03:52.030> great<00:03:52.359> for

00:03:52.559 --> 00:03:52.569 
a round of cedar cedar it's great for

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:54.839 
a round of cedar cedar it's great for
making<00:03:52.720> shingles<00:03:53.290> as<00:03:53.500> opposed<00:03:54.340> to<00:03:54.430> these<00:03:54.669> are

00:03:54.839 --> 00:03:54.849 
making shingles as opposed to these are

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:57.360 
making shingles as opposed to these are
this<00:03:54.970> is<00:03:55.120> fir<00:03:55.359> these<00:03:55.629> logs<00:03:55.840> are<00:03:55.989> fir<00:03:56.229> logs<00:03:56.500> for

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:57.370 
this is fir these logs are fir logs for

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:59.189 
this is fir these logs are fir logs for
the<00:03:57.489> actual<00:03:57.729> house<00:03:57.970> structure<00:03:58.269> so<00:03:58.599> you<00:03:58.989> put

00:03:59.189 --> 00:03:59.199 
the actual house structure so you put

00:03:59.199 --> 00:04:00.990 
the actual house structure so you put
this<00:03:59.290> into<00:03:59.470> a<00:03:59.560> round<00:03:59.859> of<00:04:00.069> cedar<00:04:00.250> and<00:04:00.519> you

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:01.000 
this into a round of cedar and you

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.569 
this into a round of cedar and you
basically<00:04:01.870> hit<00:04:02.079> it<00:04:02.169> on<00:04:02.260> top<00:04:02.530> of<00:04:02.560> here<00:04:02.919> and<00:04:02.979> you

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:03.579 
basically hit it on top of here and you

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:06.390 
basically hit it on top of here and you
would<00:04:03.699> break<00:04:04.030> split<00:04:04.750> off<00:04:04.930> a<00:04:05.229> plank<00:04:05.680> and<00:04:05.919> then

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.400 
would break split off a plank and then

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.300 
would break split off a plank and then
the<00:04:06.519> planks<00:04:06.879> or<00:04:07.030> a<00:04:07.060> shingle<00:04:08.040> basically

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:09.310 
the planks or a shingle basically

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:11.039 
the planks or a shingle basically
oh<00:04:09.489> it's<00:04:09.819> called<00:04:09.940> a<00:04:10.060> shake<00:04:10.299> actually<00:04:10.720> a<00:04:10.750> shake

00:04:12.809 --> 00:04:12.819 
put off a shake and then the shakes were

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:15.719 
put off a shake and then the shakes were
applied<00:04:13.269> to<00:04:13.810> the<00:04:13.989> to<00:04:14.379> the<00:04:14.560> logs<00:04:15.099> on<00:04:15.370> the<00:04:15.519> roof
