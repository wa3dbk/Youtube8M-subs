00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:17.559 

my<00:03:14.660> first<00:03:15.019> time<00:03:15.290> even<00:03:15.879> taking<00:03:16.879> the<00:03:17.060> bike<00:03:17.269> on

00:04:41.969 --> 00:04:41.979 
would help me continue record writing

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:45.300 
would help me continue record writing
experience<00:04:42.900> as<00:04:43.900> well<00:04:44.140> as<00:04:44.320> many<00:04:44.590> other<00:04:44.800> firsts

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:45.310 
experience as well as many other firsts

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:48.690 
experience as well as many other firsts
these<00:04:46.030> on<00:04:46.600> my<00:04:46.750> bike<00:04:46.990> like<00:04:47.770> I'm<00:04:47.979> going<00:04:48.639> to

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:48.700 
these on my bike like I'm going to

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:52.550 
these on my bike like I'm going to
attract<00:04:49.210> they<00:04:49.419> in<00:04:49.660> a<00:04:49.720> couple<00:04:50.020> of<00:04:50.080> months<00:04:50.320> so

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:52.560 
attract they in a couple of months so

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:55.700 
attract they in a couple of months so
that<00:04:53.560> would<00:04:53.710> be<00:04:53.830> pretty<00:04:54.070> exciting<00:04:54.190> to<00:04:54.910> capture

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:55.710 
that would be pretty exciting to capture

00:04:55.710 --> 00:05:02.880 
that would be pretty exciting to capture
and<00:04:59.310> I<00:05:00.310> think<00:05:01.000> the<00:05:01.120> camera<00:05:01.479> that<00:05:01.720> he's<00:05:02.530> giving

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:02.890 
and I think the camera that he's giving

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:08.850 
and I think the camera that he's giving
away<00:05:02.919> is<00:05:03.100> a<00:05:03.190> lot<00:05:03.430> better<00:05:07.320> so<00:05:08.320> yeah<00:05:08.500> that's

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:08.860 
away is a lot better so yeah that's

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:11.670 
away is a lot better so yeah that's
pretty<00:05:09.070> much<00:05:09.190> it<00:05:09.720> and<00:05:10.720> would<00:05:11.020> like<00:05:11.229> to<00:05:11.440> win

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:11.680 
pretty much it and would like to win

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:13.260 
pretty much it and would like to win
because<00:05:11.890> I<00:05:12.220> never<00:05:12.280> won<00:05:12.669> these<00:05:12.760> things<00:05:13.060> in

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:13.270 
because I never won these things in

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:15.540 
because I never won these things in
trying<00:05:14.169> to<00:05:14.260> win<00:05:14.380> for<00:05:14.410> my<00:05:14.710> first<00:05:14.919> time<00:05:15.130> and<00:05:15.400> I

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:15.550 
trying to win for my first time and I

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:17.850 
trying to win for my first time and I
highly<00:05:15.970> that<00:05:16.270> I'm<00:05:16.390> gonna<00:05:16.570> win<00:05:16.780> this<00:05:16.990> but<00:05:17.620> it's

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:17.860 
highly that I'm gonna win this but it's

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:18.420 
highly that I'm gonna win this but it's
worth<00:05:18.070> a<00:05:18.100> shot

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:18.430 
worth a shot

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:25.110 
worth a shot
and<00:05:18.729> I<00:05:21.150> think<00:05:22.150> that<00:05:22.360> having<00:05:22.660> a<00:05:23.169> camera<00:05:23.760> and<00:05:24.760> get

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:25.120 
and I think that having a camera and get

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:29.820 
and I think that having a camera and get
