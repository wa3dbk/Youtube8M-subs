00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:13.940 
know how to pronounce the word

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:18.429 
know how to pronounce the word
algorithm<00:00:14.940> and<00:00:15.350> I<00:00:16.350> will<00:00:16.980> do<00:00:17.160> a<00:00:17.190> brief<00:00:17.670> solve

algorithm and I will do a brief solve

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:21.740 
algorithm and I will do a brief solve
next<00:00:19.439> week<00:00:19.680> I<00:00:19.890> will<00:00:20.130> do<00:00:20.279> a<00:00:20.310> tutorial<00:00:20.640> on<00:00:21.359> it<00:00:21.570> but

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
next week I will do a tutorial on it but

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.509 
next week I will do a tutorial on it but
today<00:00:22.109> is<00:00:22.289> just<00:00:22.380> going<00:00:22.710> to<00:00:22.800> be<00:00:22.890> a<00:00:22.920> brief

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
today is just going to be a brief

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:28.939 
today is just going to be a brief
overview<00:00:24.590> so<00:00:25.880> to<00:00:26.880> begin<00:00:27.210> the<00:00:28.140> first<00:00:28.439> step<00:00:28.769> of

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
overview so to begin the first step of

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.910 
overview so to begin the first step of
the<00:00:29.070> human<00:00:29.369> face<00:00:29.550> lift<00:00:29.820> weight<00:00:29.970> algorithm<00:00:30.539> is

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:30.920 
the human face lift weight algorithm is

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:34.370 
the human face lift weight algorithm is
well<00:00:31.920> this<00:00:32.279> is<00:00:32.460> this<00:00:33.360> method<00:00:33.780> is<00:00:33.899> based<00:00:33.930> on

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
well this is this method is based on

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.330 
well this is this method is based on
groups<00:00:35.190> okay<00:00:35.700> so<00:00:36.480> you<00:00:36.540> have<00:00:36.780> groups<00:00:37.079> of<00:00:37.350> moves

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
groups okay so you have groups of moves

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.770 
groups okay so you have groups of moves
so<00:00:38.489> I<00:00:38.520> do<00:00:38.840> our<00:00:40.010> stuff<00:00:41.010> like<00:00:41.190> that<00:00:41.390> so<00:00:42.390> what<00:00:42.600> the

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
so I do our stuff like that so what the

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.770 
so I do our stuff like that so what the
federal<00:00:43.050> first<00:00:43.230> thing<00:00:43.379> is<00:00:43.500> you<00:00:44.460> put<00:00:44.670> the<00:00:45.450> cube

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
federal first thing is you put the cube

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:52.100 
federal first thing is you put the cube
into<00:00:45.960> a<00:00:46.620> u<00:00:47.579> d<00:00:48.329> FB<00:00:49.610> r2<00:00:50.610> l2<00:00:50.879> group<00:00:51.390> know<00:00:51.870> what<00:00:51.989> that

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
into a u d FB r2 l2 group know what that

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.560 
into a u d FB r2 l2 group know what that
means<00:00:52.350> is<00:00:52.590> if<00:00:52.920> you<00:00:53.399> put<00:00:53.579> into<00:00:53.699> that<00:00:53.820> group<00:00:54.180> you

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
means is if you put into that group you

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.330 
means is if you put into that group you
can<00:00:54.809> solve<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:55.260> cube<00:00:55.440> using<00:00:55.680> just<00:00:55.890> those

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
can solve the cube using just those

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.270 
can solve the cube using just those
moves<00:00:56.960> so<00:00:57.960> that's<00:00:58.320> the<00:00:58.530> first<00:00:58.770> step

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
moves so that's the first step

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.430 
moves so that's the first step
I'm<00:00:59.430> knockout<00:00:59.850> dumb<00:01:00.270> industry<00:01:00.719> later<00:01:01.020> I'll

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
I'm knockout dumb industry later I'll

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.020 
I'm knockout dumb industry later I'll
talk<00:01:01.980> as<00:01:02.190> I<00:01:02.250> demonstrate<00:01:02.730> but<00:01:02.850> I'm<00:01:02.940> just

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
talk as I demonstrate but I'm just

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.530 
talk as I demonstrate but I'm just
getting<00:01:03.210> a<00:01:03.359> brief<00:01:03.570> overview<00:01:03.870> versed<00:01:05.479> so<00:01:06.479> you

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
getting a brief overview versed so you

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.170 
getting a brief overview versed so you
put<00:01:07.140> into<00:01:07.409> that<00:01:07.590> group<00:01:07.860> then<00:01:08.400> the<00:01:08.700> next<00:01:09.000> step

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
put into that group then the next step

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:15.890 
put into that group then the next step
is<00:01:09.330> I<00:01:09.479> believe<00:01:09.689> it's<00:01:10.110> a<00:01:12.380> r2<00:01:13.380> l<00:01:13.590> -<00:01:13.860> f<00:01:14.130> -<00:01:14.159> B<00:01:14.490> -<00:01:14.820> u<00:01:15.600> D

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
is I believe it's a r2 l - f - B - u D

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.190 
is I believe it's a r2 l - f - B - u D
group<00:01:16.290> and<00:01:16.530> then<00:01:16.830> finally<00:01:17.400> it's<00:01:17.580> a<00:01:17.790> all<00:01:18.210> the

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
group and then finally it's a all the

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.660 
group and then finally it's a all the
letters<00:01:19.500> from<00:01:19.590> the<00:01:19.710> -<00:01:19.860> after<00:01:20.220> rhythm<00:01:20.460> group

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
letters from the - after rhythm group

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.060 
letters from the - after rhythm group
and<00:01:20.880> you<00:01:21.330> can<00:01:21.509> solve<00:01:21.720> the<00:01:21.840> cube<00:01:22.110> just<00:01:22.530> by<00:01:22.740> you

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
and you can solve the cube just by you

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.249 
and you can solve the cube just by you
know<00:01:23.100> like<00:01:25.130> that<00:01:26.130> eyelid<00:01:26.520> messed<00:01:26.700> up<00:01:26.939> okay

00:01:27.249 --> 00:01:27.259 
know like that eyelid messed up okay

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:31.069 
know like that eyelid messed up okay
with<00:01:28.259> just<00:01:28.909> 180<00:01:29.909> degree<00:01:30.299> turns<00:01:30.540> so<00:01:30.869> that's

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
with just 180 degree turns so that's

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.770 
with just 180 degree turns so that's
kind<00:01:31.409> of<00:01:31.530> the<00:01:31.770> point<00:01:32.009> of<00:01:32.189> method<00:01:32.670> it's<00:01:33.479> based

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
kind of the point of method it's based

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.080 
kind of the point of method it's based
off<00:01:33.990> of<00:01:34.049> the<00:01:34.409> regular<00:01:34.710> thisif<00:01:35.430> way<00:01:35.579> algorithm

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
off of the regular thisif way algorithm

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.539 
off of the regular thisif way algorithm
which<00:01:36.360> is<00:01:36.540> what<00:01:36.750> computers<00:01:37.680> used<00:01:38.070> to<00:01:38.280> use<00:01:38.520> to

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
which is what computers used to use to

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.730 
which is what computers used to use to
solve<00:01:38.970> a<00:01:39.150> Rubik's<00:01:39.360> cubes<00:01:39.659> I<00:01:39.869> think<00:01:40.140> the<00:01:40.470> most

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
solve a Rubik's cubes I think the most

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.940 
solve a Rubik's cubes I think the most

cube<00:02:16.190> if--and<00:02:16.849> camera<00:02:17.330> then<00:02:17.510> your<00:02:17.930> table

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
cube if--and camera then your table

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.440 
cube if--and camera then your table
let's<00:02:19.129> see<00:02:19.280> if<00:02:19.400> I<00:02:19.489> can<00:02:19.640> fix<00:02:19.849> this<00:02:20.000> little<00:02:20.299> hard

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
let's see if I can fix this little hard

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:28.330 
let's see if I can fix this little hard
okay<00:02:25.750> I<00:02:26.750> will<00:02:27.290> climb<00:02:27.530> it<00:02:27.739> and<00:02:27.950> I<00:02:28.099> will<00:02:28.220> just

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
okay I will climb it and I will just

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:31.509 
okay I will climb it and I will just
tell<00:02:28.430> you<00:02:28.610> the<00:02:28.790> time<00:02:29.030> cuz<00:02:29.500> things<00:02:30.500> down<00:02:31.130> here<00:02:31.160> a

00:02:31.509 --> 00:02:31.519 
tell you the time cuz things down here a

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:36.100 
tell you the time cuz things down here a
lot<00:02:31.790> of<00:02:31.819> the<00:02:31.910> camera<00:02:32.860> okay<00:02:34.599> this<00:02:35.599> isn't<00:02:35.810> for

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110 
lot of the camera okay this isn't for

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:38.949 
lot of the camera okay this isn't for
speed<00:02:36.440> this<00:02:37.340> is<00:02:37.549> just<00:02:37.849> a<00:02:38.000> shell<00:02:38.239> just<00:02:38.630> time<00:02:38.930> it

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:38.959 
speed this is just a shell just time it

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:45.789 
speed this is just a shell just time it
for<00:02:39.709> the<00:02:39.860> sake<00:02:40.040> of<00:02:40.069> timing<00:02:40.610> okay<00:02:43.690> so<00:02:44.690> it<00:02:44.900> one<00:02:45.709> of

00:02:45.789 --> 00:02:45.799 
for the sake of timing okay so it one of

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:47.860 
for the sake of timing okay so it one of
the<00:02:45.890> things<00:02:46.010> I'm<00:02:46.310> looking<00:02:46.670> for<00:02:46.910> wrong<00:02:47.390> edges

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
the things I'm looking for wrong edges

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:59.250 
the things I'm looking for wrong edges
now<00:02:48.049> I<00:02:48.110> see<00:02:48.440> two<00:02:48.799> here<00:02:49.549> one<00:02:50.510> here<00:02:53.290> here<00:02:54.290> okay

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:07.390 

okay<00:03:00.260> so<00:03:01.000> we're<00:03:02.000> here<00:03:02.030> oh<00:03:03.170> on<00:03:03.380> edge<00:03:03.560> here

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.400 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:26.850 

here<00:03:08.360> fix<00:03:09.170> tacos

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:26.860 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:33.430 

okay<00:03:27.860> fix<00:03:28.160> all<00:03:28.340> the<00:03:28.520> edges<00:03:31.960> now<00:03:32.960> you<00:03:33.020> have<00:03:33.290> to

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:33.440 
okay fix all the edges now you have to

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:40.510 
okay fix all the edges now you have to
make<00:03:33.680> a<00:03:34.840> cross<00:03:35.840> on<00:03:38.290> your<00:03:39.290> top<00:03:40.040> and<00:03:40.280> bottom

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:40.520 
make a cross on your top and bottom

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:43.810 
make a cross on your top and bottom
faces<00:03:40.910> the<00:03:41.270> four<00:03:42.110> until<00:03:42.560> the<00:03:42.770> last<00:03:42.950> step<00:03:43.310> or

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:43.820 
faces the four until the last step or

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:46.420 
faces the four until the last step or
mostly<00:03:44.540> into<00:03:44.720> lost<00:03:45.020> the<00:03:45.560> opposite<00:03:46.190> colors

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.430 
mostly into lost the opposite colors

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:48.190 
mostly into lost the opposite colors
like<00:03:46.610> green<00:03:46.760> blue<00:03:47.209> red<00:03:47.600> orange<00:03:47.840> and<00:03:48.080> yellow

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:48.200 
like green blue red orange and yellow

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:51.520 
like green blue red orange and yellow
lighter<00:03:48.650> treat<00:03:49.070> is<00:03:49.280> the<00:03:49.310> same<00:03:49.790> color<00:03:50.120> so<00:03:51.050> this

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:51.530 
lighter treat is the same color so this

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:54.310 
lighter treat is the same color so this
is<00:03:51.770> the<00:03:52.160> red<00:03:52.820> cross<00:03:53.180> they're<00:03:53.720> both<00:03:53.870> the<00:03:54.110> red

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:54.320 
is the red cross they're both the red

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:56.110 
is the red cross they're both the red
cross<00:03:54.620> I'll<00:03:54.890> go<00:03:55.040> into<00:03:55.280> more<00:03:55.459> detail<00:03:55.880> in<00:03:56.090> next

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:56.120 
cross I'll go into more detail in next

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:28.210 
cross I'll go into more detail in next
week<00:03:56.830> and<00:03:57.830> actually<00:03:58.190> do<00:03:58.400> the<00:03:58.700> full<00:03:59.150> solve<00:04:27.220> so

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:28.220 
week and actually do the full solve so

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:31.540 
week and actually do the full solve so
you<00:04:28.280> see<00:04:28.580> the<00:04:28.970> red<00:04:29.780> faces<00:04:30.530> way<00:04:30.979> we<00:04:31.190> would<00:04:31.340> call

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:31.550 
you see the red faces way we would call

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:49.469 
you see the red faces way we would call
them<00:04:31.729> Mersault<00:04:32.860> there<00:04:34.240> see<00:04:35.240> next<00:04:35.630> step<00:04:36.050> is

00:04:49.469 --> 00:04:49.479 

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:52.050 

that<00:04:50.479> now<00:04:50.690> we<00:04:50.750> have<00:04:50.930> to<00:04:51.020> get<00:04:51.169> the<00:04:51.349> corners

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:52.060 
that now we have to get the corners

00:04:52.060 --> 00:05:07.119 
that now we have to get the corners
basically<00:04:53.060> solved<00:05:05.440> this<00:05:06.440> part<00:05:06.740> is<00:05:06.830> actually

00:05:07.119 --> 00:05:07.129 
basically solved this part is actually

00:05:07.129 --> 00:05:09.990 
basically solved this part is actually
sort<00:05:07.430> of<00:05:07.520> like<00:05:07.699> the<00:05:07.849> Ortega<00:05:08.150> method<00:05:08.599> for<00:05:08.780> 2x2

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:10.000 
sort of like the Ortega method for 2x2

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.200 
sort of like the Ortega method for 2x2
these<00:05:11.000> is<00:05:11.270> the<00:05:11.599> same<00:05:12.849> one<00:05:13.849> of<00:05:13.940> the<00:05:14.000> same

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:14.210 
these is the same one of the same

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:17.730 
these is the same one of the same
algorithms<00:05:14.810> okay<00:05:15.440> so<00:05:16.099> corners<00:05:16.669> are<00:05:16.909> right

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:17.740 
algorithms okay so corners are right

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:30.430 
algorithms okay so corners are right
edges<00:05:28.150> okay<00:05:29.150> so<00:05:29.210> now<00:05:29.539> it's<00:05:29.719> in<00:05:29.840> the<00:05:29.960> stage<00:05:30.229> we

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:30.440 
edges okay so now it's in the stage we

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:39.029 
edges okay so now it's in the stage we
can<00:05:30.680> solve<00:05:30.889> it<00:05:31.159> with<00:05:31.370> just<00:05:33.849> 180<00:05:34.849> degree<00:05:35.210> terms

00:05:39.029 --> 00:05:39.039 

00:05:39.039 --> 00:05:43.749 

now<00:05:40.039> for<00:05:41.139> now<00:05:42.139> this<00:05:42.440> part<00:05:42.680> I<00:05:42.800> kind<00:05:43.159> of<00:05:43.340> cheat

00:05:43.749 --> 00:05:43.759 
now for now this part I kind of cheat

00:05:43.759 --> 00:05:46.390 
now for now this part I kind of cheat
because<00:05:44.030> I<00:05:44.270> don't<00:05:44.509> use<00:05:45.289> the<00:05:45.500> method<00:05:45.830> Orion<00:05:46.190> hi

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:46.400 
because I don't use the method Orion hi

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:48.459 
because I don't use the method Orion hi
so<00:05:46.460> site<00:05:46.789> because<00:05:47.120> if<00:05:47.449> I<00:05:47.780> just<00:05:48.020> have<00:05:48.169> four

00:05:48.459 --> 00:05:48.469 
so site because if I just have four

00:05:48.469 --> 00:05:49.990 
so site because if I just have four
edges<00:05:48.860> that<00:05:49.069> are<00:05:49.129> in<00:05:49.280> the<00:05:49.370> wrong<00:05:49.490> place<00:05:49.550> like

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:50.000 
edges that are in the wrong place like

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.240 
edges that are in the wrong place like
this<00:05:50.180> I<00:05:50.449> don't<00:05:51.289> know<00:05:51.349> if<00:05:51.409> you<00:05:51.500> can<00:05:51.650> see<00:05:51.830> that<00:05:52.009> I

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:52.250 
this I don't know if you can see that I

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:55.059 
this I don't know if you can see that I
just<00:05:52.610> put<00:05:53.449> it<00:05:53.539> like<00:05:53.569> that<00:05:53.900> I'll<00:05:54.199> just<00:05:54.349> do<00:05:54.650> an<00:05:54.800> H

00:05:55.059 --> 00:05:55.069 
just put it like that I'll just do an H

00:05:55.069 --> 00:06:08.110 
just put it like that I'll just do an H
term<00:05:59.860> I<00:06:01.750> did<00:06:02.750> that<00:06:02.990> wrong<00:06:03.370> that's<00:06:04.370> okay<00:06:06.789> so<00:06:07.789> so

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:08.120 
term I did that wrong that's okay so so

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:10.089 
term I did that wrong that's okay so so
that<00:06:08.330> is<00:06:08.360> what<00:06:08.779> the<00:06:08.990> human<00:06:09.440> this<00:06:09.710> with<00:06:09.919> wait

00:06:10.089 --> 00:06:10.099 
that is what the human this with wait

00:06:10.099 --> 00:06:13.899 
that is what the human this with wait
algorithm<00:06:10.580> looks<00:06:10.789> like<00:06:11.029> up<00:06:12.639> 312<00:06:13.639> with

00:06:13.899 --> 00:06:13.909 
algorithm looks like up 312 with

00:06:13.909 --> 00:06:15.370 
algorithm looks like up 312 with
explanation<00:06:14.659> probably<00:06:14.810> fast<00:06:15.169> without

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:15.380 
explanation probably fast without

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:17.320 
explanation probably fast without
exploration<00:06:16.219> once<00:06:16.580> again<00:06:16.819> not<00:06:17.060> used<00:06:17.270> for

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:17.330 
exploration once again not used for

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:20.800 
exploration once again not used for
speed<00:06:17.629> probably<00:06:18.080> good<00:06:18.319> for<00:06:18.349> FMC<00:06:18.979> though<00:06:19.810> so

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:20.810 
speed probably good for FMC though so

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:23.320 
speed probably good for FMC though so
that<00:06:21.500> is<00:06:21.710> all<00:06:21.889> for<00:06:21.919> this<00:06:22.190> week<00:06:22.250> thank<00:06:23.120> you<00:06:23.210> for
