with little LEDs behind the eyes now the

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:33.900 
with little LEDs behind the eyes now the
one<00:02:32.110> with<00:02:32.260> LEDs<00:02:32.620> behind<00:02:33.040> the<00:02:33.280> eyes<00:02:33.640> you<00:02:33.880> can

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
one with LEDs behind the eyes you can

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:36.060 
one with LEDs behind the eyes you can
actually<00:02:34.270> customize<00:02:34.480> the<00:02:34.870> colors<00:02:35.350> with<00:02:35.860> this

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:36.070 
actually customize the colors with this

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:38.280 
actually customize the colors with this
one<00:02:36.340> the<00:02:36.850> lighting<00:02:37.330> just<00:02:37.360> lights<00:02:37.840> up<00:02:38.110> the

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
one the lighting just lights up the

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.260 
one the lighting just lights up the
optical<00:02:38.680> drive<00:02:38.800> by<00:02:39.160> in<00:02:39.310> a<00:02:39.370> solid<00:02:39.730> color<00:02:39.760> so<00:02:40.180> you

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:40.270 
optical drive by in a solid color so you

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:42.600 
optical drive by in a solid color so you
can't<00:02:40.570> change<00:02:40.840> that<00:02:41.140> I<00:02:41.380> can't<00:02:42.100> show<00:02:42.310> you<00:02:42.340> both

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
can't change that I can't show you both

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:44.190 
can't change that I can't show you both
sides<00:02:42.940> of<00:02:43.120> the<00:02:43.210> chassis<00:02:43.450> at<00:02:43.630> the<00:02:43.750> same<00:02:43.930> time

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200 
sides of the chassis at the same time

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.500 
sides of the chassis at the same time
but<00:02:44.740> you<00:02:44.830> can<00:02:44.980> change<00:02:45.340> these<00:02:45.640> side<00:02:46.090> chassis

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
but you can change these side chassis

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:49.560 
but you can change these side chassis
lights<00:02:46.900> these<00:02:47.380> ones<00:02:47.620> here<00:02:48.300> independently<00:02:49.300> so

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:49.570 
lights these ones here independently so

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:50.820 
lights these ones here independently so
I<00:02:49.600> could<00:02:49.810> have<00:02:49.900> a<00:02:49.960> different<00:02:50.290> color<00:02:50.470> on<00:02:50.620> this

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:50.830 
I could have a different color on this

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:53.550 
I could have a different color on this
side<00:02:51.100> too<00:02:51.910> the<00:02:52.240> color<00:02:52.480> on<00:02:52.720> the<00:02:52.870> other<00:02:52.990> side<00:02:53.290> so

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
side too the color on the other side so

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.170 
side too the color on the other side so
I<00:02:53.590> could<00:02:53.770> have<00:02:53.860> blue<00:02:54.190> on<00:02:54.370> this<00:02:54.520> side<00:02:54.730> and<00:02:54.970> red

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
I could have blue on this side and red

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:56.760 
I could have blue on this side and red
on<00:02:55.210> the<00:02:55.450> other<00:02:55.480> and<00:02:55.930> then<00:02:56.380> I<00:02:56.470> can<00:02:56.650> of<00:02:56.740> course

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:56.770 
on the other and then I can of course

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:58.410 
on the other and then I can of course
change<00:02:57.190> this<00:02:57.460> color<00:02:57.730> under<00:02:58.060> here

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 
change this color under here

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:00.360 
change this color under here
so<00:02:58.900> let's<00:02:59.050> get<00:02:59.170> to<00:02:59.320> change<00:02:59.560> in<00:02:59.740> some<00:02:59.890> colors

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.370
