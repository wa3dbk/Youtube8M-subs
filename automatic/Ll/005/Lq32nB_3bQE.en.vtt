00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
here they're saying that the watch the

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.369 
here they're saying that the watch the
Pennington<00:00:59.820> river<00:01:00.000> and<00:01:00.239> the<00:01:00.300> cedar<00:01:00.510> river<00:01:00.750> are

Pennington river and the cedar river are

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:02.930 
Pennington river and the cedar river are
really<00:01:01.710> heating<00:01:01.890> up<00:01:02.129> really<00:01:02.489> well<00:01:02.699> for

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
really heating up really well for

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.479 
really heating up really well for
walleyes<00:01:03.329> and<00:01:03.629> most<00:01:04.350> of<00:01:04.470> them<00:01:04.589> use<00:01:04.830> just<00:01:05.159> a<00:01:05.250> jig

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
walleyes and most of them use just a jig

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.010 
walleyes and most of them use just a jig
in<00:01:05.610> a<00:01:05.670> minnow<00:01:05.850> combo<00:01:06.420> and<00:01:06.830> I<00:01:08.240> think<00:01:09.240> the<00:01:09.420> usual

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
in a minnow combo and I think the usual

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.609 
in a minnow combo and I think the usual
go-to<00:01:10.170> choice<00:01:10.380> is<00:01:10.979> a<00:01:11.010> chartreuse<00:01:11.549> Northland

00:01:12.609 --> 00:01:12.619 
go-to choice is a chartreuse Northland

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.920 
quick water in the main river channels
walleyes<00:01:32.100> will<00:01:32.460> sit<00:01:32.820> in<00:01:32.850> that<00:01:33.119> slack<00:01:33.659> water

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
walleyes will sit in that slack water

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.890 
walleyes will sit in that slack water
and<00:01:34.350> wait<00:01:35.100> for<00:01:35.340> disoriented<00:01:36.060> baked<00:01:36.299> fish<00:01:36.540> to

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
and wait for disoriented baked fish to

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.350 
and wait for disoriented baked fish to
come<00:01:37.110> tumbling<00:01:37.590> through<00:01:37.829> and<00:01:38.280> they'll<00:01:38.490> you

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
come tumbling through and they'll you

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.420 
come tumbling through and they'll you
know<00:01:39.390> as<00:01:39.780> opportunistic<00:01:40.530> feeders<00:01:41.189> they'll

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
know as opportunistic feeders they'll

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.429 
know as opportunistic feeders they'll
come<00:01:41.640> in<00:01:41.670> to<00:01:41.850> eat<00:01:42.000> those<00:01:42.210> baitfish<00:01:42.509> now<00:01:43.409> I

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
come in to eat those baitfish now I

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.770 
come in to eat those baitfish now I
think<00:01:43.710> a<00:01:44.009> jig<00:01:44.280> is<00:01:44.460> the<00:01:44.670> the<00:01:45.000> best<00:01:45.210> way<00:01:45.420> to<00:01:45.479> do

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
think a jig is the the best way to do

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.219 
think a jig is the the best way to do
that<00:01:46.159> another<00:01:47.159> way<00:01:47.369> to<00:01:47.479> if<00:01:48.479> the<00:01:48.630> walleyes<00:01:48.960> are

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
that another way to if the walleyes are

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.080 
that another way to if the walleyes are
staging<00:01:49.710> up<00:01:49.829> on<00:01:49.979> the<00:01:50.100> bottom<00:01:50.490> on<00:01:50.640> bottom
