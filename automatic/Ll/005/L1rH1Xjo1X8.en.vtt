 min 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.030
 Y 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:44.539
 the hammer citizens are great 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.539
 ocean predators 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:52.960
 they are the kings 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.960
 regulators of trophic chains 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:59.500
 ecosystems with hammerhead sharks are 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:59.500
 healthy ecosystems 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:20.500
 do not 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.840
 Y 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:30.550
 we work hand in hand with communities 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:34.680
 coastal and especially fishermen 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:38.800
 for this we do education in schools 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:41.290
 we are really focusing the efforts 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:43.840
 to reduce shark mortality 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:45.670
 hammer on the fishing site 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:48.730
 Sharks hammers are born in sweet gulf 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:52.060
 and they 're in sweet gulf for two or three 

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:53.409
 years if we do not have juvenile sharks 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.539
 today 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:57.929
 we do not have adult sharks in the 

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:57.929
 future 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:13.140
 very good conditions for the capture 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:13.140
 of hammerhead sharks 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.540
 we have a full moon on the horizon and 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:19.670
 We are using the areas of 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.950
 dawn which are the hours where the 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:24.050
 sharks are more active looking 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:26.520
 food then it is very possible that 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:29.040
 let's be lucky 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:32.100
 however some days it is possible that 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:36.980
 they are not in the area and we can not 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:36.980
 capture them truth and ready 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.310
 Y 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:50.460
 and we mark the sharks for 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:52.770
 know about their movements and about the 

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:53.980
 while they remain in Gulf 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:56.310
 sweet 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:59.810
 the marks are going to be on the sharks 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:01.780
 transmitting for 3 to 4 years 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:06.010
 and this way we can have 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:06.010
 an entire ecosystem dynamics 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:12.290
 this information is very very important 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:12.290
 for the conservation of this species 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:17.560
 something else comes 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:26.030
 teacher is perfect to mark we are 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:27.250
 the acoustic mark is perfect is 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:31.050
 alive 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:31.050
 diego there is a hammer here 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:35.520
 This is 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:42.010
 to stand out in the gala 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:46.140
 and some of this the other makes the 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:46.140
 following 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:51.260
 the water 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:58.420
 48 89 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:05.130
 male or female female female perfect 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:08.090
 like water 

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:08.090
 is that good brand 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:11.610
 is behind is not entering that true 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:15.270
 which she'm fine 

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:16.829
 back to the villa Carlos so that he 

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:19.519
 say you must stop and see for 

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:19.519
 forward porfa 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:24.490
 If you want to bring it, we implant and 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:26.320
 we close once 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:28.360
 the turn 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:30.330
 because they have hard gifts and have the 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:33.300
 hard 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:35.580
 We do not request to implant the brand in the 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:37.740
 ventral cavity of the hammerhead shark 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:41.310
 these marks are made for is for 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:45.110
 interiors these exceed all do not go 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:45.110
 to produce no effect on sharks 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:49.150
 we are now is to mark the slope and 

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:51.450
 the sea is ready 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:51.450
 Diego 

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:20.380
 We hope that shark keeps giving us 

00:05:16.699 --> 00:05:20.380
 information for four more years 

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:26.000
 perfect perfect more 

00:05:28.289 --> 00:05:32.479
 its quality quality 

00:05:47.139 --> 00:05:54.099
 at this moment costa rica have 25 or 

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:55.750
 26 percent of his from his land area 

00:05:54.099 --> 00:05:58.600
 protected 

00:05:55.750 --> 00:06:00.560
 but in the ocean they only have less 

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:03.520
 1% 

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:03.520
 from fire 

00:06:10.409 --> 00:06:16.599
 to the future 

00:06:13.129 --> 00:06:16.599
 an optimistic future 

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:22.590
 It is not like this 

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:25.790
 it's a long process 

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:25.790
 but it is possible
