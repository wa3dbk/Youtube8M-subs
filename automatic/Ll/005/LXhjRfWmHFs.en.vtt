this<00:00:43.630> is<00:00:43.840> our<00:00:44.020> isolator<00:00:44.950> 155<00:00:45.820> model<00:00:46.270> and<00:00:46.960> it's

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:47.140 
this is our isolator 155 model and it's

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:50.040 
this is our isolator 155 model and it's
designed<00:00:47.500> for<00:00:47.650> midfield<00:00:48.579> speakers<00:00:49.120> smaller

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:50.050 
designed for midfield speakers smaller

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:53.010 
designed for midfield speakers smaller
size<00:00:50.410> and<00:00:50.829> the<00:00:51.340> way<00:00:51.460> that<00:00:51.640> works<00:00:51.910> is<00:00:52.180> we<00:00:52.390> we

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:53.020 
size and the way that works is we we

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:55.470 
size and the way that works is we we
have<00:00:53.140> a<00:00:53.200> kit<00:00:53.560> that<00:00:53.770> comes<00:00:54.190> with<00:00:54.490> it<00:00:54.520> short<00:00:55.300> and

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:55.480 
have a kit that comes with it short and

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:57.510 
have a kit that comes with it short and
long<00:00:55.630> tube<00:00:56.020> short<00:00:56.440> and<00:00:56.590> long<00:00:56.739> inserts<00:00:57.250> and

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:57.520 
long tube short and long inserts and

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:59.910 
long tube short and long inserts and
this<00:00:58.090> gives<00:00:58.329> a<00:00:58.480> combination<00:00:59.200> of<00:00:59.290> 40<00:00:59.710> different

00:00:59.910 --> 00:00:59.920 
this gives a combination of 40 different

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.340 
this gives a combination of 40 different
height<00:01:00.640> and<00:01:00.880> tilt<00:01:01.030> adjustments<00:01:01.810> so<00:01:02.050> you<00:01:02.110> can

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:02.350 
height and tilt adjustments so you can

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:04.020 
height and tilt adjustments so you can
raise<00:01:02.530> the<00:01:02.560> speaker<00:01:03.070> up<00:01:03.220> you<00:01:03.430> can<00:01:03.610> tilt<00:01:03.820> it

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:04.030 
raise the speaker up you can tilt it

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:06.149 
raise the speaker up you can tilt it
down<00:01:04.089> tilt<00:01:04.449> it<00:01:04.989> up<00:01:05.110> side<00:01:05.350> because<00:01:05.799> what<00:01:06.009> you

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:06.159 
down tilt it up side because what you

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:08.969 
down tilt it up side because what you
really<00:01:06.310> exactly<00:01:07.030> so<00:01:07.240> even<00:01:07.570> in<00:01:07.720> like<00:01:07.930> a<00:01:07.979> metre

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:08.979 
really exactly so even in like a metre

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:10.740 
really exactly so even in like a metre
bridge<00:01:09.190> situation<00:01:09.970> we<00:01:10.090> get<00:01:10.240> still<00:01:10.479> dirt

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:10.750 
bridge situation we get still dirt

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:13.440 
bridge situation we get still dirt
tilted<00:01:11.500> down<00:01:11.680> and<00:01:11.920> get<00:01:12.070> that<00:01:12.250> right<00:01:12.490> level<00:01:12.880> so

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:13.450 
tilted down and get that right level so

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:15.300 
tilted down and get that right level so
it's<00:01:13.570> all<00:01:13.720> based<00:01:13.960> on<00:01:14.110> that<00:01:14.260> principle<00:01:14.770> of

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:15.310 
it's all based on that principle of

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:17.460 
it's all based on that principle of
placement<00:01:15.880> isolation<00:01:16.840> and<00:01:16.990> focus<00:01:17.440> to

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:17.470 
placement isolation and focus to

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:20.430 
placement isolation and focus to
optimize<00:01:18.130> the<00:01:18.760> use<00:01:18.970> of<00:01:19.060> the<00:01:19.299> monitor<00:01:19.750> so<00:01:20.260> these

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:20.440 
optimize the use of the monitor so these

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:22.080 
optimize the use of the monitor so these
look<00:01:20.830> interesting<00:01:21.370> the<00:01:21.460> way<00:01:21.490> you've<00:01:21.760> got<00:01:21.790> Leo

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:22.090 
look interesting the way you've got Leo

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:23.789 
look interesting the way you've got Leo

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:56.770 
it just absorb that energy and gives it

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:58.859 
it just absorb that energy and gives it
back<00:01:56.970> okay<00:01:57.970> and<00:01:58.060> this<00:01:58.150> one<00:01:58.360> was<00:01:58.450> your<00:01:58.630> first

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
like the sm 92 focal sf9 adam a 77 x but

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:25.720 
like the sm 92 focal sf9 adam a 77 x but
we<00:02:23.750> also<00:02:23.900> have<00:02:24.230> this<00:02:24.379> as<00:02:24.560> a<00:02:24.590> crossover<00:02:25.129> product

you can't a couple instrument amps from

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:34.690 
you can't a couple instrument amps from
the<00:02:33.319> floor<00:02:33.530> you<00:02:33.799> can<00:02:33.830> tilts<00:02:34.280> up<00:02:34.370> towards<00:02:34.670> your

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700

exactly particularly good when you're
recording<00:02:38.480> getting<00:02:39.260> it<00:02:39.379> up<00:02:39.500> and<00:02:39.680> you<00:02:39.799> can<00:02:40.010> make

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 
recording getting it up and you can make

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:42.789 
recording getting it up and you can make
it<00:02:40.459> and<00:02:40.610> it<00:02:40.730> just<00:02:40.760> opens<00:02:41.269> up<00:02:41.360> that<00:02:41.599> sound<00:02:41.959> and

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
then you have these ones look a little

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:46.509 
then you have these ones look a little
different<00:02:45.230> you've<00:02:45.709> got<00:02:45.890> some<00:02:46.040> more<00:02:46.129> Hardware

00:02:46.509 --> 00:02:46.519 
different you've got some more Hardware

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:49.539 
different you've got some more Hardware
on<00:02:46.549> here<00:02:46.819> it's<00:02:47.150> not<00:02:47.239> said<00:02:47.950> argosy<00:02:48.950> consoles

acoustics<00:02:54.079> product<00:02:54.500> into<00:02:54.739> it<00:02:54.860> this<00:02:55.250> is<00:02:55.340> now

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:55.459 
acoustics product into it this is now

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:57.580 
acoustics product into it this is now
called<00:02:55.790> the<00:02:55.880> spire<00:02:56.269> are<00:02:56.569> so<00:02:57.019> this<00:02:57.170> is<00:02:57.319> a<00:02:57.349> joint

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.590 
called the spire are so this is a joint

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:59.199 
called the spire are so this is a joint
venture<00:02:58.010> between<00:02:58.040> the<00:02:58.430> two<00:02:58.579> that's<00:02:58.849> correct

00:02:59.199 --> 00:02:59.209 
venture between the two that's correct

you<00:03:12.560> got<00:03:12.680> plans<00:03:12.920> for<00:03:13.540> this<00:03:14.540> is<00:03:14.810> this<00:03:15.049> is

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 
you got plans for this is this is

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:16.960 
you got plans for this is this is
following<00:03:15.739> okay<00:03:16.190> this<00:03:16.430> will<00:03:16.579> be<00:03:16.700> for<00:03:16.940> the

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:16.970 
following okay this will be for the

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:19.420 
following okay this will be for the
larger<00:03:17.420> monitors<00:03:17.900> like<00:03:18.170> the<00:03:18.319> sm<00:03:18.650> 9<00:03:18.860> as<00:03:19.069> you<00:03:19.220> see

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:19.430 
larger monitors like the sm 9 as you see

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:21.280 
larger monitors like the sm 9 as you see
here<00:03:19.760> yeah<00:03:20.120> so<00:03:20.690> that's<00:03:20.870> the<00:03:20.959> similar

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.290 
here yeah so that's the similar

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:23.170 
here yeah so that's the similar
construction<00:03:21.859> just<00:03:22.069> scaled<00:03:22.549> up<00:03:22.730> that's

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:23.180 
construction just scaled up that's

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:25.030 
construction just scaled up that's
correct<00:03:23.480> i'll<00:03:24.079> say<00:03:24.260> you<00:03:24.319> have<00:03:24.500> a<00:03:24.530> sub<00:03:24.769> woofer

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040 
correct i'll say you have a sub woofer

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.309 
correct i'll say you have a sub woofer
one<00:03:25.190> down<00:03:25.340> here<00:03:25.579> but<00:03:25.810> subwoofers<00:03:26.810> where<00:03:27.139> we're

00:03:27.309 --> 00:03:27.319 
one down here but subwoofers where we're

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:28.990 
one down here but subwoofers where we're
going<00:03:27.470> to<00:03:27.530> repackage<00:03:27.920> the<00:03:28.250> 200<00:03:28.790> in<00:03:28.880> the
