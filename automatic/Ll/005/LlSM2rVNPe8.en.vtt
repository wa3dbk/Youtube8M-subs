00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:30.650 
know steady aim quick game down so I
don't<00:04:29.340> know<00:04:29.400> what<00:04:29.520> that's<00:04:29.700> called<00:04:29.970> a

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:30.660 
don't know what that's called a

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:32.420 
don't know what that's called a
sleight-of-hand<00:04:31.170> that's<00:04:31.800> probably<00:04:32.100> what<00:04:32.280> the

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:32.430 
sleight-of-hand that's probably what the

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:35.120 
sleight-of-hand that's probably what the
basic<00:04:33.240> sniper<00:04:33.870> is<00:04:34.110> going<00:04:34.290> to<00:04:34.350> run<00:04:34.560> probably

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:35.130 
basic sniper is going to run probably

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:40.250 
basic sniper is going to run probably
most<00:04:35.790> of<00:04:35.970> them<00:04:36.150> and<00:04:37.669> I<00:04:38.669> think<00:04:39.480> they<00:04:39.870> put<00:04:40.080> the

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:40.260 
most of them and I think they put the

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:43.580 
most of them and I think they put the
quick<00:04:40.590> aim<00:04:40.770> down<00:04:40.950> sight<00:04:41.370> in<00:04:41.610> to<00:04:42.419> counter<00:04:43.050> quick

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:43.590 
quick aim down sight in to counter quick

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:47.270 
quick aim down sight in to counter quick

don't know what it's going to be called
mono<00:04:48.810> 43<00:04:49.169> I<00:04:49.200> think<00:04:49.380> assassin<00:04:50.130> but<00:04:50.970> I<00:04:51.000> basically

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:51.240 
mono 43 I think assassin but I basically

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.900 
mono 43 I think assassin but I basically
think<00:04:51.540> that's<00:04:51.780> why<00:04:51.990> and<00:04:52.460> have<00:04:53.460> you<00:04:53.580> guys<00:04:53.700> ever

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:53.910 
think that's why and have you guys ever

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:56.570 
think that's why and have you guys ever
noticed<00:04:54.330> that<00:04:54.390> treyarch<00:04:54.930> thinks<00:04:55.919> everything

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:56.580 
noticed that treyarch thinks everything

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:58.880 
noticed that treyarch thinks everything
is<00:04:56.700> a<00:04:56.760> problem<00:04:57.300> like<00:04:58.260> when<00:04:58.440> this<00:04:58.560> game<00:04:58.830> first

00:04:58.880 --> 00:04:58.890 
is a problem like when this game first

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:03.969 
is a problem like when this game first
came<00:04:59.310> out<00:04:59.610> like<00:05:00.680> it<00:05:01.680> was<00:05:01.830> so<00:05:02.400> like<00:05:02.880> patched

00:05:03.969 --> 00:05:03.979 
came out like it was so like patched

00:05:03.979 --> 00:05:07.670 
came out like it was so like patched
like<00:05:04.979> everything<00:05:05.669> was<00:05:05.790> nerve<00:05:06.210> and<00:05:07.050> the<00:05:07.110> my

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:07.680 
like everything was nerve and the my

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:10.250 
like everything was nerve and the my
eyes<00:05:07.860> was<00:05:08.280> not<00:05:08.729> just<00:05:09.030> quick<00:05:09.330> scoping<00:05:09.810> but<00:05:10.050> on

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:10.260 
eyes was not just quick scoping but on

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.350 
eyes was not just quick scoping but on
me<00:05:10.470> like<00:05:10.890> this<00:05:11.160> isn't<00:05:11.340> big<00:05:11.760> but<00:05:11.790> it's<00:05:12.150> just

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:12.360 
me like this isn't big but it's just

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:14.830 
me like this isn't big but it's just
weird<00:05:12.660> how<00:05:12.810> they<00:05:13.080> nerf<00:05:13.320> this<00:05:13.560> is<00:05:13.740> at<00:05:13.979> first<00:05:14.280> um

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:14.840 
weird how they nerf this is at first um

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:16.909 
weird how they nerf this is at first um
you<00:05:15.840> guys<00:05:15.960> remember<00:05:16.290> when<00:05:16.620> the<00:05:16.740> game<00:05:16.890> first

00:05:16.909 --> 00:05:16.919 
you guys remember when the game first

00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:19.670 
you guys remember when the game first
came<00:05:17.220> out<00:05:17.490> if<00:05:18.330> you<00:05:18.570> reload<00:05:19.110> and<00:05:19.440> then

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:19.680 
came out if you reload and then

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:23.000 
came out if you reload and then
DoubleTap<00:05:20.280> why<00:05:20.580> it<00:05:21.419> wouldn't<00:05:21.870> like<00:05:22.080> why

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:23.010 
DoubleTap why it wouldn't like why

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:26.330 
DoubleTap why it wouldn't like why
behind<00:05:23.430> it<00:05:24.419> would<00:05:24.750> switch<00:05:25.470> to<00:05:25.740> second<00:05:26.190> area

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:26.340 
behind it would switch to second area

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:28.760 
behind it would switch to second area
because<00:05:26.700> treyarch<00:05:27.390> thought<00:05:28.229> that<00:05:28.590> was<00:05:28.740> a

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:28.770 
because treyarch thought that was a

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:31.439 
because treyarch thought that was a
problem

00:05:31.439 --> 00:05:31.449 

00:05:31.449 --> 00:05:35.580 

yeah<00:05:31.930> what<00:05:33.539> they<00:05:34.539> think<00:05:34.840> quickscoping<00:05:35.439> is<00:05:35.529> a

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:35.590 
yeah what they think quickscoping is a

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:37.529 
yeah what they think quickscoping is a
problem<00:05:35.979> but<00:05:36.129> it's<00:05:36.279> definitely<00:05:36.550> not<00:05:36.879> like<00:05:37.270> if

00:05:37.529 --> 00:05:37.539 
problem but it's definitely not like if

00:05:37.539 --> 00:05:39.809 
problem but it's definitely not like if
you<00:05:38.020> can<00:05:38.199> actually<00:05:38.439> beat<00:05:39.039> someone<00:05:39.550> that<00:05:39.699> has

00:05:39.809 --> 00:05:39.819 
you can actually beat someone that has

00:05:39.819 --> 00:05:43.279 
you can actually beat someone that has
an<00:05:39.969> automatic<00:05:40.180> gun<00:05:40.779> and<00:05:41.339> you<00:05:42.339> have<00:05:42.460> a<00:05:42.490> sniper

00:05:43.279 --> 00:05:43.289 
an automatic gun and you have a sniper

00:05:43.289 --> 00:05:49.379 
an automatic gun and you have a sniper
like<00:05:45.240> it's<00:05:46.529> it's<00:05:47.529> just<00:05:47.680> doesn't<00:05:48.550> make<00:05:48.789> sense<00:05:48.849> i

00:05:49.379 --> 00:05:49.389 
like it's it's just doesn't make sense i

00:05:49.389 --> 00:05:51.329 
like it's it's just doesn't make sense i
mean<00:05:49.419> gwan<00:05:49.839> bullet<00:05:50.199> to<00:05:50.289> kill<00:05:50.319> takes<00:05:50.860> much<00:05:51.309> more

00:05:51.329 --> 00:05:51.339 
mean gwan bullet to kill takes much more

00:05:51.339 --> 00:05:54.149 
mean gwan bullet to kill takes much more
skill<00:05:51.879> than<00:05:51.909> like<00:05:52.330> four<00:05:53.110> bullets<00:05:53.620> or<00:05:53.889> like<00:05:54.129> a

sniper eighty percent of the time you're
going<00:06:03.969> to<00:06:04.029> lose<00:06:04.300> because<00:06:05.879> they<00:06:06.879> just<00:06:07.060> take<00:06:07.389> you

00:06:07.529 --> 00:06:07.539 
going to lose because they just take you

00:06:07.539 --> 00:06:10.200 
going to lose because they just take you
out<00:06:07.689> before<00:06:07.870> you<00:06:08.199> can<00:06:08.349> even<00:06:08.469> a<00:06:08.830> min<00:06:09.249> and<00:06:09.639> then

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:10.210 
out before you can even a min and then

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:12.329 
out before you can even a min and then
after<00:06:10.689> you<00:06:10.779> a<00:06:10.810> menu<00:06:11.139> you<00:06:11.710> have<00:06:11.800> to<00:06:11.949> wait<00:06:12.099> an

00:06:12.329 --> 00:06:12.339 
after you a menu you have to wait an

00:06:12.339 --> 00:06:14.489 
after you a menu you have to wait an
enemy<00:06:12.819> little<00:06:13.180> bit<00:06:13.300> just<00:06:13.509> a<00:06:13.629> split<00:06:14.020> second

00:06:14.489 --> 00:06:14.499 
enemy little bit just a split second

00:06:14.499 --> 00:06:19.760 
enemy little bit just a split second
before<00:06:14.710> you<00:06:14.949> shoot<00:06:15.509> 24<00:06:16.509> thats<00:06:16.960> way<00:06:17.550> and<00:06:18.550> i

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:19.770 
before you shoot 24 thats way and i

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:25.950
