00:00:02.179 --> 00:00:07.649
 Hello 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:12.389
 I'm going to teach you here today how 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:18.690
 to the high point in crochet I trict 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:23.279
 I made here a base of 6 chains and now 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:26.099
 I'm going to climb five chains that go 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:29.460
 serve there with my first high point 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:32.189
 he will serve it because of the 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:38.100
 height then whenever you go 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:41.040
 doing is some work that the graph of 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:44.550
 show a high court beginning of the 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:49.079
 career, you're always going to climb five 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:53.520
 chains to give the point height 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:55.710
 high tributÃ¡ high point time it he 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:59.789
 will be done with 3 thrown in the needle 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:03.290
 here as you can see and you will 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:06.630
 insert your needle at the next point 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:11.240
 here in my case I will insert in the seventh 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.240
 current when counting the needle 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:23.530
 and then people pull the line taking two 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:28.130
 thrown at a time from our needle 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:33.440
 I'm going to do it again, it's 3 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:35.930
 this in the needle in serious that the needle in the 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:39.830
 base case here is a 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:41.540
 pulls the line through the 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:44.030
 Score 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:45.560
 and then we'll talk with five loops 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:53.540
 on the needle 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:58.790
 I'll take two loops at a time from the 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:02:05.240
 my needle finishing my 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:08.030
 Triple point stayed there and I hope 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:10.690
 You next class is ok, guys. 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:10.690
 the next
