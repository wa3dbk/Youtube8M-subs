00:06:23.699 --> 00:06:27.860 
not a kick but um see what here we got
rock<00:06:24.349> let's<00:06:25.349> see<00:06:25.530> if<00:06:25.650> it<00:06:25.830> transforms<00:06:26.870> it

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:27.870 
rock let's see if it transforms it

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:30.409 
rock let's see if it transforms it
should<00:06:28.080> transform<00:06:28.560> all<00:06:28.860> of<00:06:29.039> this<00:06:29.389> because<00:06:30.389> I

00:06:30.409 --> 00:06:30.419 
should transform all of this because I

00:06:30.419 --> 00:06:31.939 
should transform all of this because I
don't<00:06:30.810> have<00:06:31.050> like<00:06:31.259> you<00:06:31.380> see<00:06:31.530> I'm<00:06:31.620> standing<00:06:31.800> on

00:06:31.939 --> 00:06:31.949 
don't have like you see I'm standing on

00:06:31.949 --> 00:06:34.339 
don't have like you see I'm standing on
sand<00:06:32.310> um<00:06:32.969> I<00:06:33.150> don't<00:06:33.210> have<00:06:33.539> anything<00:06:33.840> changed<00:06:34.289> so

00:06:34.339 --> 00:06:34.349 
sand um I don't have anything changed so

00:06:34.349 --> 00:06:36.709 
sand um I don't have anything changed so
it's<00:06:34.469> all<00:06:34.560> gonna<00:06:34.680> be<00:06:34.830> one<00:06:35.039> texture<00:06:35.449> as<00:06:36.449> you<00:06:36.630> can

00:06:36.709 --> 00:06:36.719 
it's all gonna be one texture as you can

00:06:36.719 --> 00:06:39.670 
it's all gonna be one texture as you can
see<00:06:36.840> here<00:06:37.020> it's<00:06:37.110> all<00:06:37.320> one<00:06:37.560> texture<00:06:38.039> and<00:06:38.190> we<00:06:38.280> can

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:39.680 
see here it's all one texture and we can

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:43.550 
see here it's all one texture and we can
mess<00:06:40.680> around<00:06:40.710> that<00:06:41.659> so<00:06:42.659> it<00:06:42.780> does<00:06:42.990> mess<00:06:43.229> up<00:06:43.440> the

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:43.560 
mess around that so it does mess up the

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:46.339 
mess around that so it does mess up the
textures<00:06:43.979> a<00:06:44.130> lot<00:06:44.479> but<00:06:45.479> it's<00:06:45.780> pretty<00:06:46.020> cool<00:06:46.199> to

00:06:46.339 --> 00:06:46.349 
textures a lot but it's pretty cool to

00:06:46.349 --> 00:06:47.689 
textures a lot but it's pretty cool to
mess<00:06:46.469> around<00:06:46.620> with<00:06:46.830> I<00:06:47.070> mean<00:06:47.190> if<00:06:47.370> you're<00:06:47.520> if

00:06:47.689 --> 00:06:47.699 
mess around with I mean if you're if

00:06:47.699 --> 00:06:48.680 
mess around with I mean if you're if
you've<00:06:47.849> got<00:06:48.000> a<00:06:48.030> certain<00:06:48.330> level<00:06:48.479> you're

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:48.690 
you've got a certain level you're

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:50.240 
you've got a certain level you're
working<00:06:48.960> on<00:06:49.050> and<00:06:49.289> you<00:06:49.320> want<00:06:49.500> to<00:06:49.590> do<00:06:49.680> that<00:06:49.860> to<00:06:50.070> it

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:50.250 
working on and you want to do that to it

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:52.010 
working on and you want to do that to it
then<00:06:50.880> I<00:06:50.969> definitely<00:06:51.360> recommend<00:06:51.750> doing<00:06:51.870> that

00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:52.020 
then I definitely recommend doing that

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:54.260 
then I definitely recommend doing that
because<00:06:52.740> it<00:06:52.889> adds<00:06:53.039> a<00:06:53.130> cool<00:06:53.310> texture<00:06:53.669> to<00:06:53.940> it<00:06:54.060> you

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:54.270 
because it adds a cool texture to it you

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:57.089 
because it adds a cool texture to it you
can<00:06:54.419> add<00:06:54.539> different<00:06:54.750> ones

00:06:57.089 --> 00:06:57.099 
can add different ones

00:06:57.099 --> 00:06:58.679 
can add different ones
