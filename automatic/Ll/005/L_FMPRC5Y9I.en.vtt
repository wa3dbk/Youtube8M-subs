00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:16.560
 Y 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:24.920
 hello everyone get wood is 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:27.529
 fundamental in the world of survival 

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:29.689
 but also to practice some of 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:32.540
 outdoor sports trekking 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:34.940
 hiking mountaineering not just for 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:37.699
 make us a refuge also to do 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:39.890
 fire or just to make us a 

00:00:37.699 --> 00:00:42.730
 cane to help us in our 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:45.860
 bushwalks sometimes we 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:47.900
 than to chop wood or work from 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:50.960
 wood we need big knives 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:53.750
 dimensions for machetear but a 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:56.239
 knife however small it may be 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:59.690
 get out of a lot of trouble and cover our 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:02.329
 needs in some moments and there 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:05.059
 several techniques to chop wood and 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:06.670
 one of them is the button and in some of 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:10.580
 my videos I guess you have seen 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:12.560
 chopping wood by percussion 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:15.020
 helping me with a knife and with another 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:17.960
 piece of wood and today I wanted to share 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:21.410
 with you another another way to cut 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:24.170
 and cut a piece of wood but with a 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:25.880
 Knife very small dimensions 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:28.729
 neck as you can appreciate 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:31.969
 I have here the sheet is very tiny 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:34.430
 good two fingers as you can see I do not know if 

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:38.119
 in the market there will be another smaller one and 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:40.490
 this model in particular sde boker leader 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:43.880
 frame and let's see what it is capable of 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:45.740
 As you can see, I'm surrounded by a lot of snow and 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:48.770
 the truth that the road is very 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:51.350
 difficult because every bit I sink and the 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:53.569
 snow reaches my waist so 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:56.479
 So what I 'm going to do is cut a 

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:58.459
 piece of branch here to be able 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:01.729
 make me a cane to help me in 

00:01:58.459 --> 00:02:03.649
 the walk simply with the bato ning 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:06.619
 with this mini knife as you can see 

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:09.769
 here we go marking around the branch 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:12.640
 at about 45 degrees until I can do 

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:12.640
 the cut is worth 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.930
 to 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:57.750
 As you can see, they are formed like rose petals 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:00.590
 or a rose shape without much effort 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:03.180
 we can get our cane 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:06.180
 just now cleaning the branches 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:08.099
 little girls we would have everything done and I can 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:10.080
 say good the mini knife the 

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:13.709
 small knife and all pretty much 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:17.299
 and I will continue on my path and you 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:17.299
 as always until soon
