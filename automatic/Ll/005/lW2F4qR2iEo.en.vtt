00:00:04.509 --> 00:00:09.950
 hello and welcome to this cider home 

00:00:07.759 --> 00:00:11.840
 in this match I play order 1a 

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:14.510
 but instead of a story about the features 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:17.869
 the champion I want to touch the other more 

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:20.060
 important topic team play let me 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:22.430
 I will bring you up to date at the beginning and 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:25.730
 in the middle of the game, our business was very bad 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:27.650
 we lost almost all fights and even 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:29.539
 if we managed to kill somebody we 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:32.119
 did it at the cost of their own lives 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:35.149
 their killer knew their business well 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:37.340
 the tanks also played well obviously that 

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:39.020
 opponents knew the mechanics of the game and 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:43.280
 knew how to effectively manage their 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:45.020
 champions the hardest moment of the match we 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.930
 lagged behind gold by 25 percent 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:48.829
 had three times fewer killings and lost on 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:51.800
 tower more 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:53.510
 the game was uneven and at this moment because 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:57.230
 in told us in the chat what in his opinion 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:59.020
 we can still win this game we 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:02.059
 getting ready to fight on the middle line 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:02.840
 our jarvan was dead twitch was coming back 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:05.000
 to the platform 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:07.549
 and the other three barely alive were hiding 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.830
 under the tower but the enemy team too 

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:12.040
 it was battered to the same jarvan and 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:14.630
 twitch should have come back to battle soon 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:16.820
 ramus decided not to get involved in a fight 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:19.340
 he had little health and attack under 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.060
 tower people too risky but 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.890
 twisted fate 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.170
 already taken position to quickly be 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:26.720
 behind the tower and start the battle without paying 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:29.000
 attention to comrades this led to 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:31.189
 that at the time of teleportation twisted fate 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.170
 You are a player with Lena were too far 

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:34.820
 behind 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:36.799
 gragas and ramus returned to battle but by 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:38.540
 the paths got a lot of damage from the tower and 

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:40.509
 still in place too 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:43.040
 late to join the fight 

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:44.689
 Vane was able to go from the flank and attack 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.400
 genre but did not have time to kill her without 

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:49.250
 support mates possessing 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:51.020
 control spells while their team 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:54.020
 let us look at retreats 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:56.119
 the twisted fait was not mistaken 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:58.850
 starting a fight as much as ramus had 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:01.490
 reason to retreat but they didn't have 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:04.070
 common goals and this gave our team a chance 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:07.299
 to recoup we are still lagging behind 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:09.739
 We feel much more confident 

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:10.849
 thanks to the totem we see as the enemy 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:12.980
 attacks the dragon 

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:15.720
 we also know that gragas kills 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:17.880
 minions on the top line we surround 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:20.130
 unable to hide they 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:22.230
 take a fight with jarvan and me 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:24.270
 enough health to attack them 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.430
 killers directly and Jeanne during 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:28.980
 launches a tornado saving tweez life 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:31.830
 notice that our victory is almost 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.490
 It costs the lives of Twitchy Jania me we strongly 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.020
 risked 

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:38.310
 but we knew that we would play five 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:40.230
 against four and in the end we won 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:42.270
 just barely won one more 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:44.790
 battle losing process tower on middle 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:47.250
 lines wayne attacks alone trying 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:49.170
 kill us she masterfully dodges 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:51.540
 death of the genre but it appears without 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.760
 support this way their team 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.970
 loses player after which ramus repeats 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:58.380
 same mistake attacking us alone 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:00.540
 focusing fire on it slowing down and 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:02.600
 other control effects we know that to him 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:05.940
 can not survive 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:07.920
 another wave of minions appears we 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:09.600
 know that they lost two players and 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.210
 see 3 on the top line 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:15.630
 it gives us the opportunity to demolish the tower and 

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:17.010
 finish off twisted feith now begins 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:20.070
 main fun 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:22.800
 we are still lagging behind the enemies 

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:24.690
 just killed nashora Jeanne Baron 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:27.120
 asks for help and with one risky 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:28.920
 maneuver she is sure she can 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:31.110
 alone cope with the bottom line and 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:32.010
 asks us to distract the enemy will not give them 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:34.709
 return to base 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:37.530
 my goal is to lure out enemies and interrupt 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:39.690
 returns Jarvan took an excellent position 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:43.100
 for the cataclysm which allowed us with 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:43.100
 bake great damage 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:47.840
 twisted fate and ramus tried to protect 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:49.370
 bottom line from the genre but at the same time 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:51.970
 tried not to go far from the center 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:54.350
 I hope to help our comrades defeat us 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:56.090
 again the problem was not trying 

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:57.730
 save the tower and not that they 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:59.810
 got involved in a team battle 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:02.300
 the problem was lack of coordination 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:05.209
 which don't let them achieve any of 

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:08.000
 targets the enemy had gain from the baron 

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:10.160
 advantage in gold and objects we 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.150
 could only boast coordination and 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:13.850
 team game 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:16.519
 but that was enough to kill opponents 

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:20.630
 demolish three towers and two inhibitors we 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:23.330
 leveled the game at the end of the match I commit 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:25.910
 stupid mistake opponents surround and 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:29.030
 easy kill me our team 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:30.440
 forced to fight in the minority however 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:32.450
 two players of the enemy team 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:32.990
 linger on the middle line killing 

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:35.060
 minions 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:37.550
 what could be victorious for them 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:39.919
 fight 5 on 4 turns into a victory 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:42.770
 for our team it was one of the best 

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:43.669
 matches in my life and I managed to play 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:46.190
 thousands 

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:47.630
 we could easily lose the opponent not 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:50.090
 could boast of the highest 

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:52.220
 their mastery was everything we did 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:55.550
 won thanks to a single reason 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:58.250
 team game nobody went out nobody 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:05:00.950
 gave up we listened to each other played 

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:03.410
 together and achieved the goal that's what I want 

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:06.080
 tell you on studying subjects and 

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:07.580
 champions need time but team play 

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:10.280
 this is a skill that you can 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:12.260
 take advantage right away it's not just about 

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:14.930
 buying totems or killing enemies 

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:17.750
 communicate with the team strengthen and her and 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:20.660
 cover up and weakness make mistakes 

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:23.150
 not ashamed they are doing everything regardless 

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:26.360
 skill level win the team 

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:29.169
 who know how to play with it myself 

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:29.169
