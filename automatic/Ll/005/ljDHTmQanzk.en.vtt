00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 in which all friends of youtube that is 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.580
 friend of mn but 28 commenting on another 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.130
 video so here I bring you a tutorial 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:11.010
 of minecraft in any console about 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:13.620
 how to disguise or exchange blocks 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.480
 because in my case I have disguised a 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.760
 stone block by a block of 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.310
 diamond you have drawn a block of 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.710
 diamond with a block of stone though 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.779
 you do not believe me then I tell you that when 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.090
 you break a diamond block normally 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.849
 there was a mantel, so in this case 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:32.579
 is going to give you nothing is a troll trap and 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.050
 in this case I have disguised a 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.270
 diamond block with a block of stone 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.890
 because normally if you chop a block 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.500
 of stone would make you an iron block 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.660
 but not in this case this block of 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:46.710
 Stone is going to give you a diamond block 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:48.930
 a perfect click to troll blocks and 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.000
 everything you can think of so good 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.210
 with nothing more to say we go with the 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.210
 tutorial 

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:07.650
 The materials that you will need are 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:10.620
 two repeaters of reddish stone five 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:13.890
 redstone powder something to activate the 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:15.660
 redstone an adhesive piston and the two 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.450
 blocks that you are going to disguise or 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:20.610
 exchange in my case is going to be one of 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.320
 stone and one diamond as the 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.240
 introduction I know that most of 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.100
 you are very familiar with the 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.500
 typical spare watch that basically 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.810
 consists of putting two repeaters watching 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.940
 towards the two opposites put redstone 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.460
 coming out of these same repeaters and 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:37.590
 activate them quickly with something that asks 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.869
 remains in my case I used a torch of 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.950
 rest this is basically going to create a 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.479
 renault de repsol that was what 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.550
 fast enough to do 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.560
 this piece what we are going to do is create 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:49.260
 one more outgoing that's why I said five 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.150
 Repsol powders and put a piston that 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:53.340
 in my case I still will not put it since 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:55.740
 this makes quite a noise 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:58.500
 what you are going to do is that two blocks 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:01.049
 forward of the piston you are going to put the 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:04.020
 block that you want to be disguised in my 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:05.759
 case I will put a diamond block and 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.729
 behind that block that you want to be 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:10.619
 disguise you're going to put on the disguise of 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.620
 block I do not know if I explain myself basically 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:16.319
 here you are going to put the block that you want 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.720
 hide and here you are going to put the 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:21.690
 block with which you want to hide 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:24.150
 because in my case this diamond is going to 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:26.940
 hide with this stone and we're going to 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:30.209
 basically doing what you're going to do is 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:32.700
 and connect your piston and you're going to put what 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:36.060
 that was stone in this space that 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:38.760
 it stays when the piston releases and pushes 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:41.430
 the block you're basically going to put all 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:43.950
 as many as you can or two or three the amount 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:46.410
 that you want because in my case I put some 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.430
 three and you will realize that here this is 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:50.010
 my troll block 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:52.220
 but actually this one here is my 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:54.500
 block what it was 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:56.810
 the diamond one does not and it 's basically what 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:58.220
 What is this trick you can give 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:00.710
 realize that now you can simply 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:03.410
 remove everything is going to stay like this and we 

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:06.330
 You know, these days they changed 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:08.640
 they changed then that's what the trick is 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:11.490
 of diamond here is the stone 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:13.740
 normally be in the movement of 

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:15.450
 piston that would have to happen but as 

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:16.650
 this is a clichÃ© what has happened is 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:18.630
 that these two blocks have been 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:21.060
 exchanged debt you've realized 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:22.350
 that now I'm survival and what 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:24.660
 I'm going to do is chop these two blocks 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:26.130
 you do not realize that if I spike this I do not 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:28.470
 will give nothing that is what you have to 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:30.150
 spend normally does not give you anything but if 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:32.850
 peak this look you can realize that 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:33.810
 I can come is that I think I Largue 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:35.850
 could come 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:38.280
 basically camouflage not if yes 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:39.720
 you do not mean with other stone you 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:41.970
 you can camouflage it can do what 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:44.130
 what you want and in your case in any 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:47.310
 case in an emergency case we say 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:48.780
 you need your diamonds but you do not want 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:51.209
 No one will steal it and need it in addition 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:53.370
 you need diamonds this trick can be 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:56.280
 and in any case of emergency, 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:58.290
 basically chop the block in disguise and 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:00.360
 is going to give you whatever it was because the block 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:01.920
 of diamond not in your case because you're in 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:05.040
 survival already gave it to you then 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:06.420
 you simply convert it to diamonds and 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:08.310
 history has these diamonds of 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:09.540
 emergency is not basically all the 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:12.360
 trick is written that is a trick 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:13.830
 quite simple and effective is a new 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:15.540
 for me of the best tricks for 

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:17.880
 hide blocks since you can hide 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:20.040
 any type of blocks that is 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:21.840
 quite quite useful this option and 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:23.430
 well basically not everything is not so 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:25.410
 do not forget about harmon liked 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:27.210

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:29.130
 do you have any doubt or for anything 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:30.690
 and two stay for more videos like this one 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:33.060
 different facts so good gentlemen 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:36.020
