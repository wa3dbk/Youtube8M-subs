willow in Minnesota
not<00:00:39.930> everyone<00:00:40.559> has<00:00:41.820> willows<00:00:42.120> in<00:00:42.270> the

not everyone has willows in the

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.299 
not everyone has willows in the
spring<00:00:42.719> the<00:00:42.960> autumn<00:00:43.290> willow<00:00:43.530> for<00:00:43.770> example

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
spring the autumn willow for example

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.549 
spring the autumn willow for example
flowers<00:00:44.730> sometime<00:00:45.210> in<00:00:45.360> the<00:00:45.450> summer<00:00:45.719> we<00:00:46.350> don't

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
flowers sometime in the summer we don't

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.889 
flowers sometime in the summer we don't
really<00:00:46.710> begin<00:00:47.340> to<00:00:47.370> notice<00:00:47.670> them<00:00:48.000> until<00:00:48.180> fall

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
really begin to notice them until fall

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.240 
really begin to notice them until fall
but<00:00:49.379> the<00:00:50.430> willows<00:00:51.829> actually<00:00:52.829> do<00:00:53.070> their

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
but the willows actually do their

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.610 
but the willows actually do their
flowering<00:00:53.730> very<00:00:54.270> early<00:00:54.690> in<00:00:54.809> the<00:00:54.960> spring<00:00:55.230> and

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
flowering very early in the spring and

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.590 
flowering very early in the spring and
part<00:00:56.280> of<00:00:56.399> the<00:00:56.489> reason<00:00:56.879> that<00:00:56.910> they're<00:00:57.239> able<00:00:57.420> to

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
part of the reason that they're able to

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.740 
part of the reason that they're able to
do<00:00:57.930> that<00:00:58.230> is<00:00:58.500> that<00:00:59.280> just<00:00:59.879> like<00:01:00.030> a<00:01:00.090> small<00:01:00.719> animal

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
do that is that just like a small animal

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.429 
do that is that just like a small animal
these<00:01:01.559> buds<00:01:02.160> are<00:01:02.399> very<00:01:02.640> furry<00:01:03.090> the<00:01:03.899> Sun<00:01:04.229> will

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
these buds are very furry the Sun will

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.100 
these buds are very furry the Sun will
shine<00:01:04.680> on<00:01:04.739> those<00:01:05.070> buds<00:01:05.430> and<00:01:05.729> and<00:01:05.939> shine<00:01:06.930> on

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
shine on those buds and and shine on

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.020 
shine on those buds and and shine on
that<00:01:07.290> fur<00:01:07.680> and<00:01:07.950> the<00:01:08.040> fur<00:01:08.220> actually<00:01:08.760> helps

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
that fur and the fur actually helps

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.929 
that fur and the fur actually helps
capture<00:01:09.510> the<00:01:09.630> heat<00:01:09.810> and<00:01:10.080> so<00:01:10.740> by<00:01:11.400> holding<00:01:11.610> in

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
capture the heat and so by holding in

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.230 
capture the heat and so by holding in
that<00:01:12.119> heat<00:01:12.390> these<00:01:13.080> things<00:01:13.380> can<00:01:13.650> mature<00:01:14.240> early

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
that heat these things can mature early

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.749 
that heat these things can mature early
earlier<00:01:15.990> than<00:01:16.290> other<00:01:16.470> flowers<00:01:16.979> and<00:01:17.220> and<00:01:17.580> in

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
earlier than other flowers and and in

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.899 
earlier than other flowers and and in
fact<00:01:17.970> they<00:01:18.180> can<00:01:18.240> stand<00:01:18.810> some<00:01:19.080> some<00:01:19.740> Frost<00:01:20.070> some

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
fact they can stand some some Frost some

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.240 
fact they can stand some some Frost some
cool<00:01:21.180> weather<00:01:21.479> and<00:01:21.750> still<00:01:22.500> come<00:01:22.740> back<00:01:22.979> and

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
cool weather and still come back and

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.399 
cool weather and still come back and
actually<00:01:23.460> get<00:01:23.820> their<00:01:24.000> flowering<00:01:24.390> done<00:01:24.659> this

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
actually get their flowering done this

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.080 
actually get their flowering done this
time<00:01:25.710> of<00:01:25.860> year<00:01:26.100> what<00:01:26.430> you're<00:01:26.610> going<00:01:26.729> to<00:01:26.759> see

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
time of year what you're going to see

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.749 
time of year what you're going to see
are<00:01:27.330> these<00:01:27.479> little<00:01:27.840> white<00:01:28.140> buds<00:01:28.409> as<00:01:28.770> they

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
are these little white buds as they

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:33.109 
are these little white buds as they
develop<00:01:30.360> you'll<00:01:31.229> see<00:01:31.590> them<00:01:31.829> get<00:01:32.130> grow<00:01:32.670> longer

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
develop you'll see them get grow longer

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.770 
develop you'll see them get grow longer
and<00:01:33.630> actually<00:01:34.259> take<00:01:34.860> on<00:01:35.040> a<00:01:35.070> color<00:01:35.400> and<00:01:35.780> the

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
and actually take on a color and the

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.770 
and actually take on a color and the
males<00:01:37.049> will<00:01:37.470> become<00:01:37.770> quite<00:01:38.040> yellow<00:01:38.780> the

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
males will become quite yellow the

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.920 
males will become quite yellow the
females<00:01:40.229> will<00:01:41.009> be<00:01:41.390> sometimes<00:01:42.390> they're<00:01:42.659> red

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
females will be sometimes they're red

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.740 
females will be sometimes they're red
sometimes<00:01:43.619> they're<00:01:43.920> yellow<00:01:44.490> it<00:01:45.149> depends<00:01:45.630> on

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
sometimes they're yellow it depends on

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.200 
sometimes they're yellow it depends on
the<00:01:45.899> species<00:01:46.280> actually<00:01:47.280> I've<00:01:47.729> seen<00:01:48.000> some

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
the species actually I've seen some

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.260 
the species actually I've seen some
green<00:01:48.420> ones<00:01:48.659> too<00:01:48.960> and<00:01:49.490> the<00:01:50.490> interesting<00:01:51.119> thing

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
green ones too and the interesting thing

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.270 
green ones too and the interesting thing
about<00:01:51.299> willows<00:01:51.899> is<00:01:52.110> just<00:01:52.350> like<00:01:52.560> us<00:01:52.770> just<00:01:53.100> like

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
about willows is just like us just like

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.630 
about willows is just like us just like
humans<00:01:53.700> there<00:01:54.210> are<00:01:54.450> male<00:01:54.960> willows<00:01:55.799> and<00:01:56.009> female

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
humans there are male willows and female

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.200 
humans there are male willows and female
willows<00:01:57.060> that<00:01:57.630> is<00:01:57.899> to<00:01:58.079> say<00:01:58.490> this<00:01:59.490> bush<00:01:59.969> right

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
willows that is to say this bush right

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.510 
willows that is to say this bush right
here<00:02:00.509> might<00:02:00.750> be<00:02:00.780> a<00:02:00.960> male<00:02:01.259> I<00:02:01.500> can't<00:02:02.040> tell<00:02:02.280> right

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
here might be a male I can't tell right

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.959 
here might be a male I can't tell right
now<00:02:02.700> but<00:02:03.590> it's<00:02:04.590> definitely<00:02:04.799> either<00:02:05.579> male<00:02:05.939> or

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
now but it's definitely either male or

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:08.690 
now but it's definitely either male or
female<00:02:06.659> but<00:02:06.689> not<00:02:07.079> both<00:02:07.320> and<00:02:07.680> a<00:02:08.129> lot<00:02:08.310> of<00:02:08.340> species

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
female but not both and a lot of species
