00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:19.880 

for<00:00:17.980> many<00:00:18.160> years<00:00:18.520> I<00:00:18.789> struggled<00:00:19.270> with

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
for many years I struggled with

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.490 
for many years I struggled with
identifying<00:00:20.890> as<00:00:21.160> a<00:00:21.220> feminist<00:00:21.880> I<00:00:22.320> wasn't<00:00:23.320> quite

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:23.500 
identifying as a feminist I wasn't quite

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:25.109 
identifying as a feminist I wasn't quite
sure<00:00:23.529> because<00:00:24.160> the<00:00:24.279> movement<00:00:24.670> that<00:00:24.789> as<00:00:24.970> it

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:25.119 
sure because the movement that as it

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:27.179 
sure because the movement that as it
stands<00:00:25.599> wasn't<00:00:26.260> something<00:00:26.470> that<00:00:26.830> I<00:00:26.980> could

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:27.189 
stands wasn't something that I could

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:29.400 
stands wasn't something that I could
relate<00:00:27.460> to<00:00:27.519> and<00:00:27.820> I<00:00:27.910> remember<00:00:28.179> discussing<00:00:28.779> with

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:29.410 
relate to and I remember discussing with

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:31.349 
relate to and I remember discussing with
a<00:00:29.439> friend<00:00:29.769> and<00:00:29.980> she<00:00:30.490> was<00:00:30.519> explaining<00:00:30.880> to<00:00:31.150> me

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:31.359 
a friend and she was explaining to me

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:33.270 
a friend and she was explaining to me
about<00:00:31.539> feminism<00:00:32.439> when<00:00:32.800> she<00:00:32.860> actually<00:00:32.980> said

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:33.280 
about feminism when she actually said

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:35.940 
about feminism when she actually said
you<00:00:33.970> know<00:00:34.000> it's<00:00:34.330> about<00:00:34.450> equal<00:00:34.990> having<00:00:35.650> equal

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:38.730 
you know it's about equal having equal
rights<00:00:36.150> it's<00:00:37.150> not<00:00:37.360> about<00:00:37.510> hating<00:00:37.780> men<00:00:38.110> which

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:38.740 
rights it's not about hating men which

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:40.800 
rights it's not about hating men which
is<00:00:38.920> when<00:00:39.070> I<00:00:39.340> wanted<00:00:39.790> to<00:00:40.060> distance<00:00:40.330> myself<00:00:40.570> from

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:47.050 
it but I I'm joking I am I think it's

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:51.060 
it but I I'm joking I am I think it's
very<00:00:47.260> a<00:00:48.300> very<00:00:49.300> naive<00:00:49.510> to<00:00:49.990> say<00:00:50.020> that<00:00:50.590> at<00:00:50.710> last

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:51.070

00:00:59.010 --> 00:00:59.020 
discussion like this because the problem

just you can be privileged in different
ways<00:01:15.220> people<00:01:15.730> get<00:01:15.850> very<00:01:15.970> defensive<00:01:16.720> and<00:01:16.900> they

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:17.050 
ways people get very defensive and they

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:19.110 
ways people get very defensive and they
get<00:01:17.200> upset<00:01:17.590> if<00:01:17.980> you<00:01:18.250> say<00:01:18.430> white<00:01:18.640> privilege<00:01:19.090> and

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:19.120 
get upset if you say white privilege and

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:21.330 
get upset if you say white privilege and
stuff<00:01:19.360> but<00:01:19.480> I<00:01:19.630> have<00:01:19.870> certain<00:01:20.380> privileges<00:01:20.530> like

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:21.340 
stuff but I have certain privileges like

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.040 
stuff but I have certain privileges like
I<00:01:21.460> would<00:01:21.610> have<00:01:21.730> privileges<00:01:22.360> over<00:01:22.450> a<00:01:22.720> trans

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:23.050 
I would have privileges over a trans

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:24.990 
I would have privileges over a trans
woman<00:01:23.170> because<00:01:24.070> a<00:01:24.100> trans<00:01:24.430> woman<00:01:24.580> is<00:01:24.820> more

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:25.000 
woman because a trans woman is more

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.670 
woman because a trans woman is more
likely<00:01:25.450> especially<00:01:25.990> trans<00:01:26.200> women<00:01:26.560> of<00:01:26.650> color

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:26.680 
likely especially trans women of color

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.100 
likely especially trans women of color
to<00:01:27.490> be<00:01:27.670> murdered<00:01:28.180> and<00:01:28.360> attacked<00:01:28.660> just<00:01:28.900> for

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:29.110 
to be murdered and attacked just for

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:32.940 
to be murdered and attacked just for
being<00:01:29.320> themselves<00:01:30.690> so<00:01:31.690> I<00:01:31.720> think<00:01:31.960> it<00:01:32.290> doesn't

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:32.950 
being themselves so I think it doesn't

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:34.500 
being themselves so I think it doesn't
help<00:01:33.130> to<00:01:33.250> get<00:01:33.430> defensive<00:01:33.700> when<00:01:34.060> you<00:01:34.180> hear<00:01:34.390> that

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:34.510 
help to get defensive when you hear that

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:36.090 
help to get defensive when you hear that
word<00:01:34.750> we<00:01:35.020> have<00:01:35.170> to<00:01:35.260> acknowledge<00:01:35.680> that<00:01:35.710> we<00:01:35.890> all

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:44.380 
problem with white feminism was that

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:46.890 
problem with white feminism was that
they<00:01:44.500> want<00:01:44.770> to<00:01:45.010> be<00:01:45.220> equal<00:01:45.760> to<00:01:46.270> their<00:01:46.390> fathers

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:10.350

carrying something and I'm struggling

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:13.320 
carrying something and I'm struggling
with<00:06:11.740> it<00:06:12.009> there's<00:06:12.219> no<00:06:12.339> guy<00:06:12.550> going<00:06:12.879> to<00:06:12.940> go<00:06:13.000> let

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:13.330 
with it there's no guy going to go let

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:14.159 
with it there's no guy going to go let

me take that for you though right

00:06:14.169 --> 00:06:15.980 
me take that for you though right
because<00:06:14.770> the<00:06:14.979> size<00:06:15.219> you<00:06:15.400> carry<00:06:15.699> it<00:06:15.789> yourself

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:15.990

so<00:06:16.990> I<00:06:21.029> so<00:06:22.029> I<00:06:22.060> think<00:06:22.180> that<00:06:22.629> all<00:06:22.810> of<00:06:22.990> these<00:06:23.080> things

00:06:23.399 --> 00:06:23.409 
so I so I think that all of these things

00:06:23.409 --> 00:06:25.980 
so I so I think that all of these things
-<00:06:23.680> need<00:06:24.370> to<00:06:24.520> be<00:06:24.669> addressed<00:06:25.060> that<00:06:25.330> people<00:06:25.599> have

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:25.990 
- need to be addressed that people have

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:29.129 
- need to be addressed that people have
different<00:06:26.830> levels<00:06:27.520> of<00:06:27.879> oppression<00:06:28.810> different

00:06:29.129 --> 00:06:29.139 
different levels of oppression different

00:06:29.139 --> 00:06:31.079 
different levels of oppression different
things<00:06:29.319> that<00:06:29.469> we<00:06:29.620> have<00:06:29.650> to<00:06:29.889> face<00:06:30.099> in<00:06:30.370> our<00:06:30.759> every

00:06:31.079 --> 00:06:31.089 
things that we have to face in our every

00:06:31.089 --> 00:06:32.939 
things that we have to face in our every
everyday<00:06:31.659> lives<00:06:32.080> and<00:06:32.319> I<00:06:32.409> don't<00:06:32.440> think<00:06:32.710> that

00:06:32.939 --> 00:06:32.949 
everyday lives and I don't think that
