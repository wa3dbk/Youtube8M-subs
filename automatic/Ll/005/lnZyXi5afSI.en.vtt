 and we played in the folder the game was installed 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:23.009
 usually in the drives folder and the 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:29.479
 programs and obs the fsmt then the 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:35.189
 inter cell conviction src system e 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:36.479
 we put our ace well on time to 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:41.640

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:56.070
 the game my board for example is a gtx 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.420
 580 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:01.200
 so how does the video card in 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:02.670
 chats 580 would not run this game 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:08.640
 impossible not 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:11.810
 So I just came here for anyone with 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.180
 this problem installed the ace admitted 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:17.379
 of the game 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:24.959
 was installed on the 

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:28.569
 software with src pass classes assist 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:33.040

 extend to qishan point of ll is just 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:40.389

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:54.129
 Delhi is here because I installed the 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:59.169
 pets here that this problem disappeared 

00:02:54.129 --> 00:03:00.459
 to appear and left without talking to 

00:02:59.169 --> 00:03:01.319
 a video card with the 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:04.150
 game 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:07.060
 So we're going to have this problem alone. 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:07.930
 you must delete it and run the game 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:11.950
 normally 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:16.409
 the game runs directly without asking for anything 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:20.440
 without speaking the brace option should appear 

00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:23.760

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:26.019
 found this assistir ddf de tete 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:30.040
 but just ask what the game opens 

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:31.060
 It usually comes with more 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.790
 story 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:38.470
 in my case in the case of many people the 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:42.819
 game was locking in several parts in 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:44.459
