don't see very much these days the
reality<00:02:29.330> check<00:02:29.360> on<00:02:29.660> this<00:02:29.840> Lexus<00:02:30.380> is<00:02:30.560> really

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
reality check on this Lexus is really

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:32.740 
reality check on this Lexus is really
just<00:02:31.220> the<00:02:31.459> center<00:02:31.790> stack<00:02:32.060> and<00:02:32.300> touch<00:02:32.450> screen

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
just the center stack and touch screen

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:35.199 
just the center stack and touch screen
system<00:02:32.959> it's<00:02:33.590> got<00:02:33.830> one<00:02:34.010> flaw<00:02:34.280> and<00:02:34.610> that<00:02:34.790> is<00:02:35.000> it

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:35.209 
system it's got one flaw and that is it

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:36.699 
system it's got one flaw and that is it
makes<00:02:35.360> me<00:02:35.540> go<00:02:35.690> back<00:02:35.870> and<00:02:36.050> forth<00:02:36.260> between<00:02:36.440> the

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:36.709 
makes me go back and forth between the

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:39.009 
makes me go back and forth between the
hard<00:02:36.920> controls<00:02:37.370> and<00:02:37.700> the<00:02:38.150> touchscreen<00:02:38.570> to<00:02:38.750> do

00:02:39.009 --> 00:02:39.019 
hard controls and the touchscreen to do

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:40.890 
hard controls and the touchscreen to do
simple<00:02:39.410> things<00:02:39.680> like<00:02:39.769> adjust<00:02:40.220> the<00:02:40.370> fan<00:02:40.580> speed

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
simple things like adjust the fan speed

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.270 
simple things like adjust the fan speed
for<00:02:41.900> instance<00:02:42.290> I've<00:02:42.800> got<00:02:43.070> the<00:02:43.190> air

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
for instance I've got the air

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.430 
for instance I've got the air
conditioning<00:02:43.700> on<00:02:43.790> right<00:02:44.060> now<00:02:44.239> if<00:02:44.959> I<00:02:45.110> turn<00:02:45.350> it

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.440 
conditioning on right now if I turn it

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.110 
conditioning on right now if I turn it
off<00:02:45.590> that's<00:02:46.489> great

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
off that's great

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:48.970 
off that's great
but<00:02:47.630> if<00:02:47.720> I<00:02:47.840> want<00:02:48.019> to<00:02:48.050> turn<00:02:48.200> it<00:02:48.260> back<00:02:48.380> on<00:02:48.650> there

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
but if I want to turn it back on there

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:50.890 
but if I want to turn it back on there
is<00:02:49.100> no<00:02:49.340> on<00:02:49.580> button<00:02:50.000> on<00:02:50.120> the<00:02:50.330> on<00:02:50.540> the<00:02:50.690> heart

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
is no on button on the on the heart

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:52.570 
is no on button on the on the heart
control<00:02:51.260> so<00:02:51.440> I<00:02:51.500> have<00:02:51.680> to<00:02:51.800> go<00:02:51.890> up<00:02:52.010> here<00:02:52.040> to<00:02:52.220> climb

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:52.580 
control so I have to go up here to climb

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:55.000 
control so I have to go up here to climb
it<00:02:52.760> and<00:02:52.910> I<00:02:53.390> have<00:02:53.600> to<00:02:53.750> use<00:02:53.989> the<00:02:54.260> fan<00:02:54.470> controls

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
it and I have to use the fan controls

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.810 
it and I have to use the fan controls
and<00:02:55.310> dial<00:02:55.790> it<00:02:55.970> back<00:02:56.000> up<00:02:56.330> again<00:02:57.190> now<00:02:58.190> if<00:02:58.489> I<00:02:58.640> want

00:02:58.810 --> 00:02:58.820 
and dial it back up again now if I want

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:00.400 
and dial it back up again now if I want
to<00:02:58.910> go<00:02:59.000> back<00:02:59.120> and<00:02:59.330> change<00:02:59.570> my<00:02:59.660> radio<00:02:59.959> station

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.410 
to go back and change my radio station

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:02.080 
to go back and change my radio station
then<00:03:00.709> I<00:03:00.769> need<00:03:01.010> to<00:03:01.130> go<00:03:01.220> back<00:03:01.400> to<00:03:01.459> another<00:03:01.850> menu

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
then I need to go back to another menu

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:05.110 
then I need to go back to another menu
to<00:03:02.330> do<00:03:02.480> that<00:03:02.830> it<00:03:03.830> should<00:03:04.130> be<00:03:04.340> more<00:03:04.550> intuitive

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120 
to do that it should be more intuitive

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:09.069 
to do that it should be more intuitive
than<00:03:05.150> this<00:03:06.040> if<00:03:07.040> I<00:03:07.160> turn<00:03:07.370> it<00:03:07.489> off<00:03:07.579> again<00:03:07.900> then<00:03:08.900> if

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:09.079 
than this if I turn it off again then if

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:11.140 
than this if I turn it off again then if
I<00:03:09.200> hit<00:03:09.380> Auto<00:03:09.560> that'll<00:03:10.370> turn<00:03:10.549> it<00:03:10.700> back<00:03:10.850> on

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150 
I hit Auto that'll turn it back on

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:14.110 
I hit Auto that'll turn it back on
but<00:03:11.720> the<00:03:11.840> problem<00:03:12.230> then<00:03:12.410> is<00:03:12.680> it<00:03:13.370> dials<00:03:13.700> the<00:03:13.910> fan

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.120 
but the problem then is it dials the fan

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.960 
but the problem then is it dials the fan
speed<00:03:14.480> all<00:03:14.630> the<00:03:14.660> way<00:03:14.870> up<00:03:14.959> to<00:03:15.079> high<00:03:15.730> again<00:03:16.730> I

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:16.970 
speed all the way up to high again I

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:19.780 
speed all the way up to high again I
have<00:03:17.150> to<00:03:17.269> go<00:03:17.390> back<00:03:17.540> to<00:03:17.720> climb<00:03:17.959> it<00:03:18.170> and<00:03:18.790> adjust

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:19.790 
have to go back to climb it and adjust

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:23.410 
have to go back to climb it and adjust
it<00:03:20.209> back<00:03:20.420> down<00:03:20.690> and<00:03:21.049> again<00:03:21.950> I<00:03:22.250> have<00:03:23.060> to<00:03:23.180> go<00:03:23.299> back

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:23.420 
it back down and again I have to go back

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:25.990 
it back down and again I have to go back
to<00:03:23.630> audio<00:03:23.930> to<00:03:24.440> do<00:03:24.620> my<00:03:24.769> radio<00:03:25.070> station<00:03:25.459> it's

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 
to audio to do my radio station it's

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.880 
to audio to do my radio station it's
just<00:03:26.299> it's<00:03:26.570> just<00:03:26.870> sort<00:03:27.049> of<00:03:27.140> this<00:03:27.290> hunting<00:03:27.680> tech

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:27.890 
just it's just sort of this hunting tech
