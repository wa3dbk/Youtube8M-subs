versions of the green ninja now however

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.869 
versions of the green ninja now however
I<00:00:39.030> think<00:00:39.360> we're<00:00:39.809> up<00:00:39.989> to<00:00:40.020> 12<00:00:40.950> I<00:00:41.370> think<00:00:41.640> if<00:00:41.760> I

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
I think we're up to 12 I think if I

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.420 
I think we're up to 12 I think if I
counted<00:00:42.300> right<00:00:42.540> and<00:00:43.530> then<00:00:43.710> of<00:00:43.860> course<00:00:44.100> we<00:00:44.280> have

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
counted right and then of course we have

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.299 
counted right and then of course we have
the<00:00:44.579> gold<00:00:44.820> ninja<00:00:45.239> which<00:00:45.750> was<00:00:45.960> still<00:00:46.200> lloyd<00:00:46.860> but

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
the gold ninja which was still lloyd but

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.360 
the gold ninja which was still lloyd but
you<00:00:47.850> know<00:00:47.940> just<00:00:48.239> the<00:00:48.719> gold<00:00:48.960> ninja<00:00:49.350> for<00:00:49.559> a<00:00:49.739> very

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
you know just the gold ninja for a very

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.880 
you know just the gold ninja for a very
short<00:00:50.789> period<00:00:51.059> of<00:00:51.329> time<00:00:51.420> actually<00:00:51.899> and<00:00:52.350> then

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
short period of time actually and then

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.400 
short period of time actually and then
he<00:00:53.190> went<00:00:53.670> back<00:00:54.030> to<00:00:54.329> being<00:00:54.570> the<00:00:54.870> green<00:00:55.230> ninja

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
he went back to being the green ninja

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.490 
he went back to being the green ninja
again<00:00:55.890> and<00:00:56.760> then<00:00:57.000> we<00:00:57.149> have<00:00:57.180> the<00:00:57.629> I<00:00:57.660> think<00:00:58.109> this

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
again and then we have the I think this

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.610 
again and then we have the I think this
was<00:00:58.770> the<00:00:59.070> techno<00:00:59.579> robes<00:01:00.289> sometimes<00:01:01.289> I<00:01:01.410> get<00:01:01.590> a

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
was the techno robes sometimes I get a

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:02.930 
was the techno robes sometimes I get a
little<00:01:01.710> mixed<00:01:02.070> up<00:01:02.370> on<00:01:02.550> what<00:01:02.760> all<00:01:02.910> the

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
little mixed up on what all the

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.340 
little mixed up on what all the
different<00:01:03.149> robes<00:01:03.570> are<00:01:03.750> called<00:01:04.019> because

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
different robes are called because

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:05.840 
different robes are called because
they've<00:01:04.500> had<00:01:04.619> so<00:01:04.680> many<00:01:05.309> different<00:01:05.640> versions

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.929 
they've had so many different versions
now<00:01:06.299> but<00:01:07.229> I<00:01:07.409> think<00:01:07.530> there<00:01:07.890> are<00:01:08.010> a<00:01:08.310> lot<00:01:08.909> of

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
ninja on this outfit I believe they

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.199 
ninja on this outfit I believe they
refer<00:02:27.480> to<00:02:27.510> it<00:02:27.720> as<00:02:27.870> the<00:02:28.080> deep<00:02:28.410> stone<00:02:29.209> outfit

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:30.209 
refer to it as the deep stone outfit

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:32.690 
refer to it as the deep stone outfit
which<00:02:30.450> I<00:02:30.780> like<00:02:31.350> it<00:02:31.560> I<00:02:31.680> really<00:02:31.709> really<00:02:32.370> like<00:02:32.520> the

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
which I like it I really really like the

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.400 
which I like it I really really like the
new<00:02:32.850> mask<00:02:33.150> with<00:02:33.480> the<00:02:33.600> black<00:02:33.840> and<00:02:34.110> the<00:02:34.200> green

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
new mask with the black and the green

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:37.760 
new mask with the black and the green
and<00:02:34.620> then<00:02:35.130> this<00:02:35.280> last<00:02:35.580> one<00:02:35.850> is<00:02:36.240> the<00:02:37.020> possessed

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 
and then this last one is the possessed

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:41.949 
and then this last one is the possessed
version<00:02:38.520> of<00:02:38.700> Lloyd<00:02:39.450> so<00:02:40.080> it's<00:02:40.260> sort<00:02:41.010> of<00:02:41.160> Morrow

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:41.959 
version of Lloyd so it's sort of Morrow

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:44.750 
version of Lloyd so it's sort of Morrow
possessing<00:02:42.959> the<00:02:43.860> green<00:02:44.070> ninja<00:02:44.220> but<00:02:44.550> it<00:02:44.670> is

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
possessing the green ninja but it is

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.460 
possessing the green ninja but it is
still<00:02:45.090> a<00:02:45.150> version<00:02:45.570> of<00:02:45.690> the<00:02:45.810> green<00:02:46.020> ninja<00:02:46.170> it's

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
still a version of the green ninja it's

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.340 
still a version of the green ninja it's
just<00:02:46.620> the<00:02:46.770> evil<00:02:47.100> one<00:02:47.250> and<00:02:47.750> so<00:02:48.750> I<00:02:48.780> think<00:02:49.050> they're

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
just the evil one and so I think they're

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:52.190 
just the evil one and so I think they're
all<00:02:49.500> really<00:02:49.530> cool<00:02:50.120> but<00:02:51.120> now<00:02:51.510> that<00:02:51.750> you've<00:02:51.870> seen

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
all really cool but now that you've seen

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.250 
all really cool but now that you've seen
Lloyd<00:02:52.680> go<00:02:53.040> all<00:02:53.340> the<00:02:53.610> way<00:02:53.730> from<00:02:54.060> evil<00:02:54.690> to<00:02:55.020> good

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
Lloyd go all the way from evil to good

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.370 
Lloyd go all the way from evil to good
and<00:02:55.590> back<00:02:56.040> to<00:02:56.250> evil<00:02:56.640> akin<00:02:56.970> at<00:02:57.120> the<00:02:57.239> end<00:02:57.450> there

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380
