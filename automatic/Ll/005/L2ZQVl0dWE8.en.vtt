00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:56.290

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:53.530
 interesting is the bogeyman something skin looks like 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:58.120
 I can turn it on personally and 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:03:00.250
 so better to include nicknames they do not 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:02.200
 barmaley just looks like everyone's skin 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:05.620
 can barmaley shoots in parallel too 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:08.049

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.470
 near the fire harz he defeated the pancake this 

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:12.130
 really 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:15.250
 Volodya and Volodya you do not really hang straight 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:16.190

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:24.490
 the call well really yab answered in if there was 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:27.710
 would make a fire in the air deeper 

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:29.540
 fun of course seriously fun guys 

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:31.400
 something interesting event at first 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:34.880
 since I see this honestly so that 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:40.700
 held such an event damn flooded 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:42.200
 I'm shorter now everything is go nuts but 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:43.480
 it seems normal to me 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:46.940
 held out 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:49.970
 here look elena maybach there bridge 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:51.800
 from above also looks at all this 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:55.130
 went all he can already say lost 

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:58.490
 yes all this will no longer be considered what 

00:03:55.130 --> 00:04:01.400
 but as long as you go or it will be fucking like 

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:04.340
 it is not quite right it at all here 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:07.430
 this one here you seem to sing for shrinkage 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:10.310
 I had not seen before that's where the devil 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:12.170
 pushed out that but him as you see not 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:16.690
 was on him on she leaked he sweat etc. 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:18.650
 gateway and along the way so well here 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:22.070
 administration and here I am 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:23.990
 well little so true but somehow 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:25.940
 seriously so interesting he looks there 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:29.180
 running administration here is so small 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:32.150
 i run and see i don't how i can 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:38.289
 of course try but climb of course 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:41.379
 I can not so oh and where 

00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:43.899
 oh amide teleported clear and back 

00:04:41.379 --> 00:04:45.819
 on top it was shorter so enrico up 

00:04:43.899 --> 00:04:49.180
 this can not be really issued 

00:04:45.819 --> 00:04:52.110
 the event is shorter here guys I won 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:55.149
 event and all this due to the fact that 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:56.800
 one was a cheater and the other was 

00:04:55.149 --> 00:04:58.960
 wow and how am I there shorter on the bottom block 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:00.550
 was as you see and yet 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:03.789
 administration decided to appoint 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:06.639
 the winner is me here and in short here it is 

00:05:03.789 --> 00:05:08.469
 that skin of choice has come any 

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:11.080
 absolutely could give me skins and car 

00:05:08.469 --> 00:05:13.149
 it will be generally excellent now 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:15.189
 at least you will ride but you donâ€™t 

00:05:13.149 --> 00:05:18.610
 think friends are not forever 

00:05:15.189 --> 00:05:21.639
 It's all like a visual after a restart 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:23.949
 the game is all gone well well now 

00:05:21.639 --> 00:05:25.389
 Ride probably well and then shorter 

00:05:23.949 --> 00:05:29.439
 probably give some homeless 

00:05:25.389 --> 00:05:31.629
 just like that yes it is not an eternal thing but 

00:05:29.439 --> 00:05:33.639
 constantly ride here don't get out 

00:05:31.629 --> 00:05:35.709
 games for this I certainly will not but 

00:05:33.639 --> 00:05:38.949
 Now I do not know now I want it even 

00:05:35.709 --> 00:05:45.389
 protune hour now we have to drive 

00:05:38.949 --> 00:05:50.169
 of course away from all players to 

00:05:45.389 --> 00:05:53.860
 You need to register gps and so on. 

00:05:50.169 --> 00:05:57.849
 hijack my swallow wow you and 

00:05:53.860 --> 00:06:00.849
 and here he is Volodya Volodya Volodya has found 

00:05:57.849 --> 00:06:02.979
 I still found me something now will 

00:06:00.849 --> 00:06:05.129
 pursue yes damn need to somehow 

00:06:02.979 --> 00:06:08.139
 break away from Volodya he is really all 

00:06:05.129 --> 00:06:10.240
 seven the whole event is shorter with besides 

00:06:08.139 --> 00:06:12.939
 I was like you think I need 

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:15.279
 tyunit I do not know exactly here to go 

00:06:12.939 --> 00:06:17.769
 not long have to be exiled from this 

00:06:15.279 --> 00:06:23.439
 Of course it will really break away 

00:06:17.769 --> 00:06:26.169
 now probably ok ok nifiga neither 

00:06:23.439 --> 00:06:28.539
 fig a fig itself damn it faster 

00:06:26.169 --> 00:06:30.849
 scoot out shorter cops right away it's 

00:06:28.539 --> 00:06:33.849
 blew up some cops damn easy 

00:06:30.849 --> 00:06:38.979
 It will generally be cool car guys at 

00:06:33.849 --> 00:06:41.139
 Violet does not seem to be more of course 

00:06:38.979 --> 00:06:43.660
 under the jacket that fit what they 

00:06:41.139 --> 00:06:45.880
 some pancakes dumb colors why so 

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:49.930
 in short guys I decided to give my car 

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:51.670
 your subscriber Volodya because all 

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:54.190
 the events are shorter he wrote me text messages 

00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:56.260
 really distracted me okay 

00:06:54.190 --> 00:07:00.790
 plus everything he then somehow me 

00:06:56.260 --> 00:07:04.690
 accidentally found along the way therefore not 

00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:07.210
 it seems he is the hero of this video and he is more 

00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:09.880
 worthy and ride this car than i 

00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:12.190
 the more I already somehow tired of her 

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:14.920
 I already want to go out of the game so 

00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:16.900

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:19.240
