00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:05.220
 hey people today i wanted theirs 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.049
 energetic help ask it goes 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.360
 because I found a position 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:11.910
 have the the elster form software 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.370
 also available for linux and mac 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:17.369
 Who wants to know that maybe that is 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.779
 A tax software exists only for 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.000
 windows so far 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.400
 Although there is also an online portal though 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.920
 that is very much according to my sources 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.050
 poor because he lacks many features 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:32.130
 but there are in the windows version 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:34.590
 yes the problem is that there is 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.270
 Although alternative but they are 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.680
 are not worth anything too expensive and 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.559
 just not worth it at normal 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:43.020
 Users therefore had it online 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.190
 petition that finally something happen 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.579
 should that finally this software 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:50.370
 times for linux and mac should appear 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:51.840
 there are already one of my sources 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.270
 linux and a mac variant 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.460
 but it was not published there 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:59.760
 it seems to be there too 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.710
 few users of linux and mac gives that 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.989
 But I think I'm idiotic there 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.030
 mean that everyone is equal 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.250
 should that finally against 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.590
 this monopoly monopolization of 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.650
 Windows should do that already 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.439
 it's pretty unfair to users 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.360
 other operating system 

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:20.330
 there is already a version there 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.549
 that's what it actually stands for 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:24.869
 theoretically no cost 

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:26.759
 This version is also free to use 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.170
 give it is not a thing if you the 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.640
 commercially spread that one for it 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.740
 money demands that no problem 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:35.159
 but it should at least be a variant 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:38.579
 for linux and also mac give that 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:40.950
 everything else sent to the windows 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:43.920
 in the bag , so to speak plays everything 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:46.079
 forcing windows to use and that is 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.470
 in my opinion not fair there mine 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:52.380
 opinion of linux belongs to the future 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:54.479
 That's why I call for a clear year 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.930
 you that the elster form software 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:02:00.270
 should also appear for linux and mac 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.979
 So I ask you on change.org 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.140
 to express their opinion 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:06.689
 You have to enter your first name surname 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.879
 and enter your e-mail address 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:10.649
 postal code and yet for my sake 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:12.790
 A good reason was not good 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:14.680
 give in and the hard ones 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.420
 Of course , that way too, do away with that here 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:20.170
 not which is not shown in the wall 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:21.909
 Who signs what then has to do that 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.829
 be signed and that's it 

00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:30.730
 As far as finished we'll look how 

00:02:23.829 --> 00:02:32.829
 many have signatures so yes we 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.819
 already have a few more 151 I have 

00:02:32.829 --> 00:02:34.510
 the petition, of course, immediately 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:36.549
 signed 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:37.870
 I ask you for it too 

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:39.970
 sign the theme if you like 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:41.079
 a little interested here it must 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.370
 Of course not sign 

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:43.900
 even better if you were 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:45.909
 would sign and this video 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.870
 would share about the people of it 

00:02:45.909 --> 00:02:49.389
 to draw attention 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:50.849
 no I'm not cool in this case 

00:02:49.389 --> 00:02:53.650
 although that's actually one 

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:56.230
 But the basic principle of youtube is me 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:58.030
 would like to stop that from this project 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:00.669
 learns he is of course much 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:02.919
 better if you change.org your page 

00:03:00.669 --> 00:03:03.400
 directly shares are you learn something directly 

00:03:02.919 --> 00:03:05.139
 thing is 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:07.359
 here is still a very informative text 

00:03:05.139 --> 00:03:09.400
 You can read this and 

00:03:07.359 --> 00:03:12.900
 Thank you for your eventual 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.900
 Support until next time
