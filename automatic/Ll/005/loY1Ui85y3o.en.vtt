00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:01.299 
chords bar chords are a lot harder to

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:02.939 
chords bar chords are a lot harder to
play<00:01:01.510> they<00:01:01.659> require<00:01:01.989> a<00:01:02.019> lot<00:01:02.290> of<00:01:02.320> strength<00:01:02.710> so

00:01:02.939 --> 00:01:02.949

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:05.680 
it's totally normally you just got to

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.620 
it's totally normally you just got to
keep<00:01:05.860> practicing<00:01:06.460> these<00:01:06.610> so<00:01:07.299> let's<00:01:07.450> take<00:01:07.600> a

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:07.630 
keep practicing these so let's take a

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:09.539 
keep practicing these so let's take a
look<00:01:07.840> at<00:01:07.900> a<00:01:07.960> few<00:01:08.140> bar<00:01:08.320> chords<00:01:08.619> so<00:01:09.219> the<00:01:09.340> first

know where the roots of the chords are
and<00:01:15.340> the<00:01:15.399> root<00:01:15.579> is<00:01:15.820> the<00:01:15.969> note<00:01:16.119> that<00:01:16.329> gives<00:01:16.539> the

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:45.850 
this is going to make our a major bar

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:47.520 
this is going to make our a major bar
chord<00:01:45.880> and<00:01:46.390> chances<00:01:47.049> are<00:01:47.140> it<00:01:47.229> doesn't<00:01:47.380> quite

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:47.530 
chord and chances are it doesn't quite

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:48.779 
chord and chances are it doesn't quite
sound<00:01:47.740> that<00:01:47.920> clean<00:01:48.100> if<00:01:48.249> this<00:01:48.369> is<00:01:48.490> the<00:01:48.520> first

00:01:48.779 --> 00:01:48.789 
sound that clean if this is the first

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:50.910 
sound that clean if this is the first
time<00:01:48.939> you've<00:01:49.090> played<00:01:49.299> a<00:01:49.329> bar

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:50.920

just keep being patient with yourself

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:54.450 
just keep being patient with yourself
now<00:01:53.080> where<00:01:53.229> did<00:01:53.350> this<00:01:53.470> come<00:01:53.530> from<00:01:53.770> this<00:01:54.310> is

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:54.460 
now where did this come from this is

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:57.179 
now where did this come from this is
actually<00:01:54.850> just<00:01:55.030> like<00:01:55.270> an<00:01:55.420> E<00:01:55.509> major<00:01:55.689> chord<00:01:56.189> just

00:01:57.179 --> 00:01:57.189 
actually just like an E major chord just

00:01:57.189 --> 00:01:59.670 
actually just like an E major chord just
scooting<00:01:57.939> it<00:01:58.030> up<00:01:58.180> using<00:01:58.750> our<00:01:59.020> first<00:01:59.259> finger<00:01:59.470> as

00:01:59.670 --> 00:01:59.680 
scooting it up using our first finger as

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:01.469 
scooting it up using our first finger as
a<00:01:59.710> bar<00:01:59.979> it's<00:02:00.310> basically<00:02:00.610> the<00:02:00.729> same<00:02:00.970> thing<00:02:01.030> the

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:01.479 
a bar it's basically the same thing the

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:03.810 
a bar it's basically the same thing the
same<00:02:01.509> form<00:02:01.990> but<00:02:02.710> now<00:02:02.860> it's<00:02:03.159> an<00:02:03.280> a<00:02:03.399> major<00:02:03.580> chord

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:03.820 
same form but now it's an a major chord

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:06.420 
same form but now it's an a major chord
so<00:02:04.630> the<00:02:04.899> cool<00:02:05.049> thing<00:02:05.080> is<00:02:05.320> about<00:02:05.619> this<00:02:05.860> like<00:02:06.280> you

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:06.430 
so the cool thing is about this like you

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:07.770 
so the cool thing is about this like you
just<00:02:06.580> saw<00:02:06.759> I<00:02:06.909> can<00:02:07.090> move<00:02:07.210> this<00:02:07.360> anywhere

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:07.780 
just saw I can move this anywhere

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:10.139 
just saw I can move this anywhere
depending<00:02:08.590> on<00:02:08.950> where<00:02:09.130> the<00:02:09.250> root<00:02:09.489> is<00:02:09.670> which<00:02:10.119> is

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:10.149 
depending on where the root is which is

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:12.510 
depending on where the root is which is
the<00:02:10.479> lowest<00:02:11.080> note<00:02:11.230> we're<00:02:11.350> playing<00:02:11.560> that

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:12.520 
the lowest note we're playing that

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:14.070 
the lowest note we're playing that
determines<00:02:12.970> what<00:02:13.150> court<00:02:13.569> it<00:02:13.690> is<00:02:13.780> so<00:02:13.959> this

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
determines what court it is so this

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.030 
determines what court it is so this
would<00:02:14.260> be<00:02:14.350> a<00:02:14.380> G<00:02:14.650> major<00:02:14.860> chord<00:02:15.239> be<00:02:16.239> a<00:02:16.480> major<00:02:17.040> flat

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
would be a G major chord be a major flat

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.680 
would be a G major chord be a major flat
major<00:02:18.280> you<00:02:18.580> can<00:02:18.730> move<00:02:18.819> this<00:02:18.970> anywhere<00:02:19.540> you

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
major you can move this anywhere you

00:03:39.509 --> 00:03:39.519 
going to look like this anymore it

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:42.430 
going to look like this anymore it
actually<00:03:39.700> looks<00:03:40.090> like<00:03:40.299> this

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:42.440 
actually looks like this

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:44.410 
actually looks like this
this<00:03:43.100> is<00:03:43.220> kind<00:03:43.520> of<00:03:43.550> a<00:03:43.640> tricky<00:03:43.910> fingering<00:03:44.270> some

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:44.420 
this is kind of a tricky fingering some

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:45.940 
this is kind of a tricky fingering some
people<00:03:44.690> prefer<00:03:44.840> to<00:03:45.110> bar<00:03:45.290> the<00:03:45.470> third<00:03:45.650> finger

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:45.950 
people prefer to bar the third finger

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:49.720 
people prefer to bar the third finger
this<00:03:46.730> takes<00:03:47.090> a<00:03:47.180> lot<00:03:47.360> of<00:03:47.390> strength<00:03:47.720> to<00:03:47.840> do<00:03:48.730> now

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:49.730 
this takes a lot of strength to do now

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:51.700 
this takes a lot of strength to do now
this<00:03:49.880> is<00:03:50.000> what<00:03:50.120> a<00:03:50.150> major<00:03:50.330> form<00:03:50.750> looks<00:03:50.900> like<00:03:51.170> you

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:51.710 
this is what a major form looks like you

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:53.140 
this is what a major form looks like you
can<00:03:51.860> see<00:03:52.010> it<00:03:52.070> in<00:03:52.160> front<00:03:52.370> of<00:03:52.430> you<00:03:52.520> so<00:03:52.970> now<00:03:53.090> the

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:53.150 
can see it in front of you so now the

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:54.610 
can see it in front of you so now the
rout<00:03:53.390> is<00:03:53.510> on<00:03:53.630> the<00:03:53.750> D<00:03:53.900> string<00:03:53.930> so<00:03:54.350> this<00:03:54.470> would

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:54.620 
rout is on the D string so this would

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:57.070 
rout is on the D string so this would
actually<00:03:54.740> be<00:03:54.950> a<00:03:55.040> D<00:03:55.250> major<00:03:55.430> chord<00:03:55.840> but<00:03:56.840> one<00:03:56.960> of

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:57.080 
actually be a D major chord but one of

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:58.600 
actually be a D major chord but one of
the<00:03:57.170> C<00:03:57.350> major<00:03:57.530> chord<00:03:57.680> and<00:03:58.100> move<00:03:58.250> down<00:03:58.460> to<00:03:58.580> the

the C major chord and move down to the

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:01.180 
the C major chord and move down to the
third<00:03:58.850> fret<00:03:59.170> that's<00:04:00.170> where<00:04:00.380> C<00:04:00.590> is<00:04:00.620> on<00:04:00.980> the<00:04:01.160> a

third fret that's where C is on the a

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:03.370 
third fret that's where C is on the a
string<00:04:01.570> wherever<00:04:02.570> the<00:04:02.810> note<00:04:02.960> is<00:04:03.110> on<00:04:03.260> the<00:04:03.350> a

your<00:04:31.020> your<00:04:31.979> major<00:04:32.159> form<00:04:32.490> lift<00:04:33.240> up<00:04:33.360> your<00:04:33.479> third

00:04:33.649 --> 00:04:33.659 
your your major form lift up your third

00:04:33.659 --> 00:04:37.399 
your your major form lift up your third
finger<00:04:34.969> sometimes<00:04:35.969> it'll<00:04:36.719> be<00:04:36.840> easier<00:04:37.169> to<00:04:37.289> use

00:04:37.399 --> 00:04:37.409 
finger sometimes it'll be easier to use

00:04:37.409 --> 00:04:40.149 
finger sometimes it'll be easier to use
your<00:04:37.560> third<00:04:37.740> finger<00:04:37.919> on<00:04:38.219> the<00:04:39.060> seventh<00:04:39.389> fret

00:04:40.149 --> 00:04:40.159 
your third finger on the seventh fret

00:04:40.159 --> 00:04:44.800 
your third finger on the seventh fret
for<00:04:41.159> the<00:04:41.219> dominant<00:04:41.669> form<00:04:42.529> so<00:04:43.529> now<00:04:43.680> you<00:04:44.550> have

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:44.810 
for the dominant form so now you have

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:47.420 
for the dominant form so now you have
six<00:04:45.810> different<00:04:45.990> positions<00:04:46.620> to<00:04:46.800> use<00:04:46.979> and<00:04:47.279> it's

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:47.430 
six different positions to use and it's

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:49.360 
six different positions to use and it's
very<00:04:47.639> important<00:04:48.120> that<00:04:48.150> you<00:04:48.270> use<00:04:48.389> different

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:49.370 
very important that you use different

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:51.320 
very important that you use different
it's<00:04:50.370> very<00:04:50.580> important<00:04:50.909> that<00:04:50.939> you<00:04:51.029> can<00:04:51.180> tell

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:51.330 
it's very important that you can tell

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:53.029 
it's very important that you can tell
the<00:04:51.419> difference<00:04:51.569> between<00:04:51.749> the<00:04:52.620> ones<00:04:52.800> that<00:04:52.949> are

00:04:53.029 --> 00:04:53.039 
the difference between the ones that are

00:04:53.039 --> 00:04:55.429 
the difference between the ones that are
based<00:04:53.219> off<00:04:53.370> the<00:04:53.580> E<00:04:53.610> string<00:04:54.050> and<00:04:55.050> the<00:04:55.169> ones<00:04:55.349> that

00:04:55.429 --> 00:04:55.439 
based off the E string and the ones that

00:04:55.439 --> 00:05:00.350 
based off the E string and the ones that
are<00:04:55.590> based<00:04:55.800> off<00:04:55.949> the<00:04:56.129> a<00:04:56.159> string<00:04:59.360> because

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:00.360 
are based off the a string because

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:02.540 
are based off the a string because
that's<00:05:01.289> how<00:05:01.529> you<00:05:01.590> can<00:05:01.830> figure<00:05:02.009> out<00:05:02.099> what<00:05:02.310> court

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:02.550 
that's how you can figure out what court

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:04.369 
that's how you can figure out what court
it<00:05:02.669> is<00:05:02.759> by<00:05:03.120> using<00:05:03.330> those<00:05:03.539> strings<00:05:03.900> so<00:05:04.169> if

00:05:04.369 --> 00:05:04.379 
it is by using those strings so if

00:05:04.379 --> 00:05:06.890 
it is by using those strings so if
you're<00:05:05.069> figuring<00:05:05.789> out<00:05:05.939> what<00:05:06.240> a<00:05:06.270> c-major<00:05:06.689> chord

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:06.900 
you're figuring out what a c-major chord

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:10.040 
you're figuring out what a c-major chord
is<00:05:07.460> on<00:05:08.460> the<00:05:08.610> a<00:05:08.639> string<00:05:08.759> your<00:05:09.180> C<00:05:09.389> is<00:05:09.509> right<00:05:09.719> here

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:10.050 
is on the a string your C is right here

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:11.809 
is on the a string your C is right here
from<00:05:10.650> one<00:05:10.770> at<00:05:10.860> a<00:05:10.919> major<00:05:11.099> chord<00:05:11.460> I'd<00:05:11.639> use<00:05:11.789> the

00:05:11.809 --> 00:05:11.819 
from one at a major chord I'd use the

00:05:11.819 --> 00:05:15.709 
from one at a major chord I'd use the
major<00:05:12.120> shape<00:05:13.099> now<00:05:14.099> on<00:05:14.460> the<00:05:14.729> E<00:05:14.759> string<00:05:15.240> see<00:05:15.539> is

00:05:15.709 --> 00:05:15.719 
major shape now on the E string see is

00:05:15.719 --> 00:05:18.200 
major shape now on the E string see is
all<00:05:15.900> the<00:05:16.169> way<00:05:16.259> up<00:05:16.409> here<00:05:16.710> so<00:05:17.610> if<00:05:17.729> I<00:05:17.849> wanted<00:05:18.089> a

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:18.210 
all the way up here so if I wanted a

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:19.909 
all the way up here so if I wanted a
major<00:05:18.449> chord<00:05:18.810> on<00:05:18.900> see<00:05:19.139> on<00:05:19.319> the<00:05:19.409> E<00:05:19.439> string<00:05:19.800> I'd

00:05:19.909 --> 00:05:19.919 
major chord on see on the E string I'd

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:22.219 
major chord on see on the E string I'd
use<00:05:20.099> the<00:05:20.339> major<00:05:20.849> shape<00:05:21.180> for<00:05:21.599> the<00:05:21.930> one<00:05:22.050> of<00:05:22.139> the<00:05:22.199> E

00:05:22.219 --> 00:05:22.229 
use the major shape for the one of the E

00:05:22.229 --> 00:05:25.159 
use the major shape for the one of the E
string<00:05:22.879> now<00:05:23.879> let's<00:05:24.360> say<00:05:24.479> I<00:05:24.509> wanted<00:05:24.749> to<00:05:24.839> c<00:05:24.960> minor

00:05:25.159 --> 00:05:25.169 
string now let's say I wanted to c minor

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:28.670 
string now let's say I wanted to c minor
I<00:05:25.439> just<00:05:25.770> make<00:05:25.919> that<00:05:26.069> a<00:05:26.129> minor<00:05:26.370> shape<00:05:26.610> and<00:05:27.680> same

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:28.680 
I just make that a minor shape and same

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:30.649 
I just make that a minor shape and same
thing<00:05:28.979> goes<00:05:29.159> here<00:05:29.430> if<00:05:29.520> I<00:05:29.610> wanted<00:05:29.849> to<00:05:29.999> c<00:05:30.419> minor

00:05:30.649 --> 00:05:30.659 
thing goes here if I wanted to c minor

00:05:30.659 --> 00:05:32.990 
thing goes here if I wanted to c minor
i'd<00:05:30.900> use<00:05:31.110> in<00:05:31.289> the<00:05:31.469> minor<00:05:31.680> form<00:05:32.009> but<00:05:32.580> i'm<00:05:32.669> using

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:33.000 
i'd use in the minor form but i'm using

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.490 
i'd use in the minor form but i'm using
the<00:05:33.089> form<00:05:33.389> that<00:05:33.479> has<00:05:33.629> the<00:05:33.960> root<00:05:34.110> on<00:05:34.349> the<00:05:34.469> a

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:34.500 
the form that has the root on the a

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:36.219 
the form that has the root on the a
string<00:05:34.650> and<00:05:35.069> that's<00:05:35.219> very<00:05:35.400> important<00:05:35.909> that<00:05:36.029> we

00:05:36.219 --> 00:05:36.229 
string and that's very important that we

00:05:36.229 --> 00:05:39.260 
string and that's very important that we
keep<00:05:37.229> those<00:05:37.500> consistent<00:05:38.400> with<00:05:38.759> the<00:05:38.969> string

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:39.270 
keep those consistent with the string

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:40.519 
keep those consistent with the string
otherwise<00:05:39.479> we're<00:05:40.050> not<00:05:40.139> going<00:05:40.259> to<00:05:40.319> be<00:05:40.379> playing

00:05:40.519 --> 00:05:40.529 
otherwise we're not going to be playing

00:05:40.529 --> 00:05:42.860 
otherwise we're not going to be playing
the<00:05:40.680> right<00:05:40.800> chords<00:05:41.180> what<00:05:42.180> this<00:05:42.360> does<00:05:42.569> is<00:05:42.750> it

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:42.870 
the right chords what this does is it

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:44.570 
the right chords what this does is it
shows<00:05:43.050> you<00:05:43.229> that<00:05:43.379> there's<00:05:43.620> a<00:05:43.680> C<00:05:43.949> minor<00:05:44.189> here

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:44.580 
shows you that there's a C minor here

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:47.689 
shows you that there's a C minor here
and<00:05:45.479> a<00:05:45.599> C<00:05:45.750> minor<00:05:45.960> up<00:05:46.139> here<00:05:46.379> also<00:05:47.279> shows<00:05:47.490> you

00:05:47.689 --> 00:05:47.699 
and a C minor up here also shows you

00:05:47.699 --> 00:05:49.760 
and a C minor up here also shows you
that<00:05:47.849> there's<00:05:48.120> a<00:05:48.180> be<00:05:48.750> major<00:05:49.050> here<00:05:49.409> in<00:05:49.560> a<00:05:49.620> B

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:49.770 
that there's a be major here in a B

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:51.649 
that there's a be major here in a B
major<00:05:49.979> right<00:05:50.250> here<00:05:50.490> so<00:05:50.699> we<00:05:50.819> have<00:05:50.969> options<00:05:51.210> all

00:05:51.649 --> 00:05:51.659 
major right here so we have options all

00:05:51.659 --> 00:05:53.570 
major right here so we have options all
the<00:05:51.779> sudden<00:05:51.960> we<00:05:52.469> have<00:05:52.589> two<00:05:52.770> places<00:05:53.099> to<00:05:53.399> play

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:53.580 
the sudden we have two places to play

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:55.579 
the sudden we have two places to play
each<00:05:53.729> one<00:05:53.939> of<00:05:53.969> these<00:05:54.120> chords<00:05:54.599> so<00:05:55.229> going<00:05:55.469> back

00:05:55.579 --> 00:05:55.589 
each one of these chords so going back

00:05:55.589 --> 00:05:58.700 
each one of these chords so going back
to<00:05:55.740> the<00:05:56.479> hypothetical<00:05:57.479> example<00:05:57.960> where<00:05:58.560> we're

00:05:58.700 --> 00:05:58.710 
to the hypothetical example where we're

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:00.860 
to the hypothetical example where we're
on<00:05:58.889> the<00:05:59.099> internet<00:05:59.430> looking<00:05:59.610> for<00:05:59.819> a<00:06:00.300> tab<00:06:00.569> and

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:00.870 
on the internet looking for a tab and

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:03.230 
on the internet looking for a tab and
you<00:06:01.649> know<00:06:01.740> I<00:06:01.800> has<00:06:01.949> some<00:06:02.129> pretty<00:06:02.279> easy<00:06:02.610> chords

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:03.240 
you know I has some pretty easy chords

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:04.519 
you know I has some pretty easy chords
and<00:06:03.449> then<00:06:03.539> also<00:06:03.689> there's<00:06:03.990> a<00:06:04.050> really<00:06:04.229> weird

00:06:04.519 --> 00:06:04.529 
and then also there's a really weird

00:06:04.529 --> 00:06:06.829 
and then also there's a really weird
cord<00:06:04.919> in<00:06:05.039> there<00:06:05.069> like<00:06:05.339> F<00:06:05.490> sharp<00:06:05.669> minor<00:06:05.759> I<00:06:06.180> can

00:06:06.829 --> 00:06:06.839 
cord in there like F sharp minor I can

00:06:06.839 --> 00:06:08.170 
cord in there like F sharp minor I can
go<00:06:06.960> through<00:06:06.990> these<00:06:07.319> forms<00:06:07.710> and<00:06:07.889> figure<00:06:08.129> out

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:08.180 
go through these forms and figure out

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:10.279 
go through these forms and figure out
there's<00:06:09.180> an<00:06:09.270> f-sharp<00:06:09.419> minor<00:06:09.779> right<00:06:10.050> here

00:06:10.279 --> 00:06:10.289 
there's an f-sharp minor right here

00:06:10.289 --> 00:06:12.800 
there's an f-sharp minor right here
there's<00:06:11.099> also<00:06:11.310> an<00:06:11.580> f-sharp<00:06:11.729> minor<00:06:12.060> will<00:06:12.539> based

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:12.810 
there's also an f-sharp minor will based

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:14.389 
there's also an f-sharp minor will based
off<00:06:12.990> the<00:06:13.139> f-sharp<00:06:13.289> on<00:06:13.649> the<00:06:13.740> a<00:06:13.770> string<00:06:13.889> all<00:06:14.279> the

00:06:14.389 --> 00:06:14.399 
off the f-sharp on the a string all the

00:06:14.399 --> 00:06:16.339 
off the f-sharp on the a string all the
way<00:06:14.490> up<00:06:14.610> here<00:06:14.639> so<00:06:15.539> obviously<00:06:15.990> if<00:06:16.169> we're

00:06:16.339 --> 00:06:16.349 
way up here so obviously if we're

00:06:16.349 --> 00:06:18.649 
way up here so obviously if we're
playing<00:06:16.500> in<00:06:16.710> the<00:06:16.800> open<00:06:17.039> position<00:06:17.419> this<00:06:18.419> F

00:06:18.649 --> 00:06:18.659 
playing in the open position this F

00:06:18.659 --> 00:06:20.809 
playing in the open position this F
sharp<00:06:18.870> would<00:06:19.469> be<00:06:19.620> the<00:06:19.770> appropriate<00:06:20.159> choice

00:06:20.809 --> 00:06:20.819 
sharp would be the appropriate choice

00:06:20.819 --> 00:06:27.630 
sharp would be the appropriate choice
because<00:06:21.180> we<00:06:21.300> don't<00:06:21.449> have<00:06:21.479> to<00:06:21.659> move<00:06:21.810> very<00:06:21.870> far

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:27.640 

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:29.830 

that's<00:06:28.640> how<00:06:28.820> we<00:06:28.880> can<00:06:29.090> start<00:06:29.420> to<00:06:29.570> formulate

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:29.840 
that's how we can start to formulate

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:31.600 
that's how we can start to formulate
these<00:06:30.170> chords<00:06:30.560> using<00:06:30.860> our<00:06:30.950> own<00:06:31.100> vocabulary

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:31.610 
these chords using our own vocabulary

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:34.480 
these chords using our own vocabulary
and<00:06:32.120> you<00:06:32.960> know<00:06:33.080> we're<00:06:33.440> not<00:06:33.530> dependent<00:06:34.160> now<00:06:34.280> on

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:34.490 
and you know we're not dependent now on

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:36.850 
and you know we're not dependent now on
chord<00:06:34.790> dictionaries<00:06:35.420> now<00:06:35.930> at<00:06:36.290> this<00:06:36.470> point<00:06:36.680> we

00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:36.860 
chord dictionaries now at this point we

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:39.550 
chord dictionaries now at this point we
can<00:06:37.010> find<00:06:37.250> any<00:06:37.490> major<00:06:37.820> minor<00:06:38.390> or<00:06:38.660> dominant<00:06:39.260> 7th

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:39.560 
can find any major minor or dominant 7th

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:42.130 
can find any major minor or dominant 7th
chord<00:06:39.830> in<00:06:40.040> two<00:06:40.700> different<00:06:40.940> places<00:06:41.150> on<00:06:41.630> the

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:42.140 
chord in two different places on the

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:44.500 
chord in two different places on the
neck<00:06:42.350> one<00:06:43.250> place<00:06:43.550> the<00:06:43.730> first<00:06:43.850> place<00:06:44.120> is<00:06:44.300> based

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:44.510 
neck one place the first place is based

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:46.360 
neck one place the first place is based
off<00:06:44.720> the<00:06:44.960> root<00:06:45.260> notes<00:06:45.500> of<00:06:45.680> the<00:06:45.710> E<00:06:45.770> string<00:06:46.190> and

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:46.370 
off the root notes of the E string and

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:48.190 
off the root notes of the E string and
the<00:06:46.820> second<00:06:47.150> place<00:06:47.300> is<00:06:47.480> based<00:06:47.690> off<00:06:47.840> the<00:06:48.020> root

00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:48.200 
the second place is based off the root

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:50.200 
the second place is based off the root
notes<00:06:48.380> of<00:06:48.560> the<00:06:48.680> a<00:06:48.710> string<00:06:48.970> so<00:06:49.970> this<00:06:50.090> is<00:06:50.180> a

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:50.210 
notes of the a string so this is a

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:52.330 
notes of the a string so this is a
really<00:06:50.390> interesting<00:06:50.900> concept<00:06:51.650> and<00:06:51.860> it<00:06:51.950> helps

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:52.340 
really interesting concept and it helps

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:53.860 
really interesting concept and it helps
you<00:06:52.460> out<00:06:52.490> once<00:06:53.000> you<00:06:53.090> memorize<00:06:53.420> these<00:06:53.600> six

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:53.870 
you out once you memorize these six

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:55.900 
you out once you memorize these six
forms<00:06:54.290> and<00:06:54.470> memorize<00:06:55.340> the<00:06:55.490> notes<00:06:55.640> of<00:06:55.790> the<00:06:55.820> E

00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:55.910 
forms and memorize the notes of the E

00:06:55.910 --> 00:06:58.240 
forms and memorize the notes of the E
and<00:06:56.030> the<00:06:56.180> a<00:06:56.240> string<00:06:56.720> you're<00:06:57.530> pretty<00:06:57.800> much<00:06:57.860> set

00:06:58.240 --> 00:06:58.250 
and the a string you're pretty much set

00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:00.190 
and the a string you're pretty much set
so<00:06:58.520> there<00:06:58.670> you<00:06:58.700> have<00:06:58.820> it<00:06:59.000> you<00:06:59.600> can<00:06:59.780> now<00:06:59.900> find

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:00.200 
so there you have it you can now find

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:03.370 
so there you have it you can now find
any<00:07:00.500> major<00:07:01.190> minor<00:07:01.790> or<00:07:02.090> dominant<00:07:02.570> 7th<00:07:02.870> chord<00:07:03.170> in

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:03.380 
any major minor or dominant 7th chord in

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:05.800 
any major minor or dominant 7th chord in
two<00:07:03.830> different<00:07:04.040> places<00:07:04.280> on<00:07:05.000> the<00:07:05.300> neck<00:07:05.450> the

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:05.810 
two different places on the neck the

00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:07.480 
two different places on the neck the
first<00:07:06.080> place<00:07:06.290> based<00:07:06.560> off<00:07:06.740> the<00:07:06.950> E<00:07:06.980> string

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:07.490 
first place based off the E string

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:09.460 
first place based off the E string
second<00:07:08.030> place<00:07:08.210> based<00:07:08.480> off<00:07:08.690> the<00:07:08.840> a<00:07:08.870> string<00:07:09.320> and

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:09.470 
second place based off the a string and

00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:10.690 
second place based off the a string and
the<00:07:09.620> cool<00:07:09.770> thing<00:07:09.800> is<00:07:10.040> you're<00:07:10.280> going<00:07:10.430> to<00:07:10.490> find

00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:10.700 
the cool thing is you're going to find

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:13.510 
the cool thing is you're going to find
that<00:07:11.420> if<00:07:11.600> the<00:07:11.870> e<00:07:12.140> string<00:07:12.590> form<00:07:12.890> is<00:07:13.010> up<00:07:13.160> here<00:07:13.430> on

00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:13.520 
that if the e string form is up here on

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:15.310 
that if the e string form is up here on
the<00:07:13.610> neck<00:07:13.790> the<00:07:14.210> a<00:07:14.240> string<00:07:14.720> form<00:07:15.020> is<00:07:15.140> going<00:07:15.260> to

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:15.320 
the neck the a string form is going to

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:17.590 
the neck the a string form is going to
be<00:07:15.440> down<00:07:15.650> here<00:07:15.680> and<00:07:16.190> vice<00:07:16.700> versa<00:07:17.090> if<00:07:17.330> you're<00:07:17.450> a

00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:17.600 
be down here and vice versa if you're a

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:19.390 
be down here and vice versa if you're a
string<00:07:17.960> form<00:07:18.380> is<00:07:18.530> up<00:07:18.650> here<00:07:18.950> you're<00:07:19.160> each

00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:19.400 
string form is up here you're each

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:20.980 
string form is up here you're each
string<00:07:19.670> form<00:07:19.880> is<00:07:20.000> going<00:07:20.150> to<00:07:20.210> be<00:07:20.300> down<00:07:20.480> here<00:07:20.510> so

00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:20.990 
string form is going to be down here so

00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:22.450 
string form is going to be down here so
there's<00:07:21.170> always<00:07:21.380> one<00:07:21.650> close<00:07:21.980> to<00:07:22.010> the<00:07:22.280> position

00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:22.460 
there's always one close to the position

00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:24.790 
there's always one close to the position
or<00:07:22.760> playing<00:07:23.030> it<00:07:23.240> and<00:07:23.390> always<00:07:24.050> choose<00:07:24.440> the<00:07:24.470> cord

00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:24.800 
or playing it and always choose the cord

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:26.860 
or playing it and always choose the cord
that's<00:07:24.920> closer<00:07:25.220> because<00:07:26.090> you<00:07:26.510> know<00:07:26.630> we<00:07:26.780> don't

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:26.870 
that's closer because you know we don't

00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:28.690 
that's closer because you know we don't
want<00:07:27.050> to<00:07:27.110> move<00:07:27.230> around<00:07:27.380> very<00:07:27.770> much<00:07:28.070> we<00:07:28.430> want<00:07:28.610> to
