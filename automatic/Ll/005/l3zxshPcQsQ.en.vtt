00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 there guys hats here i am 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.299
 Hello, I'm Philippe, and we're going today. 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:10.080
 bring you a small debate 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:14.509
 about a possible future that Doubt made 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.509
 in the work that, in fact, none of these 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:30.240
 recapitulating events of the last 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.099
 chapter we saw that the wise man 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.110
 he remembered all his childhood when he saw 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.030
 a poster saying that the ex had been 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.250
 dead beauty 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.079
 We keep talking, but this is the 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.290
 second commander the tests of beard 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:45.600
 I do not know how I know. 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.730
 did not recognize him before 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:52.050
 I would have seen a poster, yes, it's very 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:56.100
 possible and then enters a notification 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:58.610
 I like the future, so I can stay 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.589
 very easy shit the person 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:03.390
 conveniently after the event 

00:01:01.589 --> 00:01:06.960
 remember who is who 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:09.750
 except that the Brazilian people in the book are 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:14.820
 very important is found in the word 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:17.220
 case by case as you know is the name of the 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.770
 the canon of the fleet line and precisely 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.720
 this name is static in the newspaper until 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.970
 because the revolutionaries commented 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.970
 the chance that made a hole in his chest 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:29.549
 So I was in the forum research and 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.649
 there the guy because everything means not only 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:35.009
 kazuki in one of the interpretations of 

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:37.640
 Candinho precisely what the cup 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:40.140
 sake dollar 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:42.960
 so when the flavor got the news 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:45.869
 in the newspaper he saw a blue bag that cup 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.939
 and also saw the name 2 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:50.609
 We know you had no time. 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:53.549
 most striking in childhood 23 in the latter 

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:55.649
 Saturday that is not the one of the exchange of 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:59.119
 bodies how they actually became brothers 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:59.119
 Like a wedding, huh? 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:18.420
 the alliance has a convincing explanation 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:21.510
 he saw the attack killed and if any 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:25.680
 thing to go back to at the same time 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:28.200
 it was only one upa conveniently died and 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:30.480
 I'm the responsible one. 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:34.280
 I find it very interesting and I think it is 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.280
 important because 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:40.970
 Do you think I 'm Southern War? 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.010
 now it may be that it is not so 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:45.140
 war of certification, I thought the signal 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:47.240
 neon green and if you have not 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:49.280
 convinced you think it was a mistake 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:52.430
 fails a hole worth thinking the wise 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.930
 felt the death of this guy he could 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:55.750
 very well have looked several times to 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:58.400
 image of him and feel some little thing 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:00.260
 masks the feeling of him as a brother there 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.210
 was locked inside it 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:05.120
 so when he received that impact 

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:07.670
 he felt and that pain he felt 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:09.830
 came down along with all the memories and 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:12.680
 this he remembered in this way he 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:15.620
 remembered that this impact and everything 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:17.690
 my opinion is very explainable is super 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:20.510
 quiet in even more with the aspiration 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:23.260
 of acasos and glasses and that for me is 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:25.700
 sensational is president for being 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:28.310
 Brazilian does not speak Japanese most of 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:30.020
 We always talk because Japanese loses. 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:32.120
 much of the word from big teams can 

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:35.420
 be interpreted as meaning modern 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:37.880
 won the cluj or cabal ehe you you 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:39.440
 but you want and Japanese precipitate 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:42.230
 it goes independently of the UN 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:44.240
 had written the Brazilian agent 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:46.730
 criticized the church by law are surrounding 

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:48.860
 we will never understand when under the 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:53.320
 Japanese law where you will get information from 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:56.090
 way to find out is pretty cool then 313 

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:58.460
