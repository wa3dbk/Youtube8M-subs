so<00:00:22.619> what<00:00:22.830> we<00:00:22.920> came<00:00:23.070> up<00:00:23.130> with<00:00:23.460> was<00:00:23.699> a<00:00:23.730> simple

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
so what we came up with was a simple

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.950 
so what we came up with was a simple
desk<00:00:24.930> lamp<00:00:25.230> called<00:00:25.710> air<00:00:26.250> light<00:00:26.570> that<00:00:27.570> uses

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
desk lamp called air light that uses

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.130 
desk lamp called air light that uses
this<00:00:28.650> organic<00:00:29.099> LED<00:00:29.609> lighting<00:00:30.420> technology<00:00:30.960> to

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
this organic LED lighting technology to

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.580 
this organic LED lighting technology to
make<00:00:31.890> a<00:00:31.920> lamp<00:00:32.250> without<00:00:33.210> a<00:00:33.390> light<00:00:33.570> bulb<00:00:33.780> one<00:00:34.500> of

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
make a lamp without a light bulb one of

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.440 
make a lamp without a light bulb one of
the<00:00:34.649> advantages<00:00:34.710> of<00:00:35.219> organic<00:00:35.700> LED<00:00:36.090> is<00:00:36.239> that<00:00:36.360> it

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
the advantages of organic LED is that it

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.270 
the advantages of organic LED is that it
doesn't<00:00:36.690> generate<00:00:36.960> heat<00:00:37.200> so<00:00:37.890> it's<00:00:38.010> one<00:00:38.129> of<00:00:38.190> the

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
doesn't generate heat so it's one of the

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.680 
doesn't generate heat so it's one of the
few<00:00:38.430> light<00:00:38.700> sources<00:00:39.120> that<00:00:39.239> you<00:00:39.360> can<00:00:39.510> actually

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
few light sources that you can actually

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.930 
few light sources that you can actually
reach<00:00:40.649> out<00:00:40.890> and<00:00:41.070> touch<00:00:41.250> directly<00:00:41.640> without

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
reach out and touch directly without

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.549 
reach out and touch directly without
getting<00:00:42.329> burned<00:00:42.540> it<00:00:42.870> just<00:00:43.020> kind<00:00:43.140> of<00:00:43.170> operates

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
getting burned it just kind of operates

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.619 
getting burned it just kind of operates
at<00:00:44.160> skin<00:00:44.610> temperature<00:00:44.910> and<00:00:45.239> so<00:00:45.329> we<00:00:45.450> added

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
at skin temperature and so we added

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.450 
at skin temperature and so we added
touch<00:00:46.260> controls<00:00:46.710> because<00:00:47.039> it<00:00:47.129> was<00:00:47.250> very

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
touch controls because it was very

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.459 
touch controls because it was very
intuitive<00:00:48.000> and<00:00:48.210> natural<00:00:48.719> and<00:00:48.989> your<00:00:49.079> tendency

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
intuitive and natural and your tendency

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.319 
intuitive and natural and your tendency
is<00:00:49.559> to<00:00:49.590> want<00:00:49.739> to<00:00:49.950> actually<00:00:50.100> just<00:00:50.460> reach<00:00:51.090> out

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
is to want to actually just reach out

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.529 
is to want to actually just reach out
and<00:00:51.600> touch<00:00:52.230> the<00:00:52.410> light<00:00:52.559> source<00:00:52.739> of<00:00:52.949> the<00:00:53.100> future

00:00:53.529 --> 00:00:53.539 
and touch the light source of the future

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:56.330 
and touch the light source of the future
the<00:00:54.539> location<00:00:54.870> of<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:55.680> Banting<00:00:56.190> and<00:00:56.250> best

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
done in Canada you don't have to go all

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.499 
done in Canada you don't have to go all
the<00:01:13.080> way<00:01:13.170> down<00:01:13.260> to<00:01:13.830> Silicon<00:01:14.490> Valley<00:01:14.670> or<00:01:15.180> kind
