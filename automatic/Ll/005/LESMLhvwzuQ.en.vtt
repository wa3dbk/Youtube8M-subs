00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
on boosted here's a mid boost and it's

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.680 
on boosted here's a mid boost and it's
just<00:00:31.679> to<00:00:31.949> tone<00:00:32.189> everything<00:00:32.850> on<00:00:32.969> for<00:00:33.210> more<00:00:33.420> and

got clean and just a touch of reverb on
it<00:00:45.469> maybe<00:00:46.469> some<00:00:46.710> professional<00:00:47.129> sales<00:00:47.520> goods

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
it maybe some professional sales goods

00:00:47.700 --> 00:01:13.970 
it maybe some professional sales goods
basically<00:00:48.059> the<00:00:48.180> guitar<00:00:48.450> sound<00:00:49.399> so<00:00:50.399> nice<00:00:50.579> warm

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:13.980 

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:20.980 

I<00:01:15.200> love<00:01:16.200> it<00:01:16.320> it's<00:01:16.710> great<00:01:16.800> and<00:01:17.430> with<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:17.640> first

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:20.990 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:34.190 

excuse<00:01:21.990> of<00:01:22.110> a<00:01:22.170> growler<00:01:32.060> kind<00:01:33.060> of<00:01:33.090> a<00:01:33.210> low<00:01:33.420> I<00:01:33.870> mean

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
excuse of a growler kind of a low I mean

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.720 
excuse of a growler kind of a low I mean
it's<00:01:34.380> a<00:01:34.440> mid<00:01:34.620> boost<00:01:34.770> but<00:01:35.100> it<00:01:35.220> kind<00:01:35.460> of<00:01:35.520> gives<00:01:35.610> a

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:35.730 
it's a mid boost but it kind of gives a

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:47.500 
it's a mid boost but it kind of gives a
bit<00:01:35.850> of<00:01:35.940> edge<00:01:36.060> to<00:01:36.330> it<00:01:36.360> as<00:01:36.630> well

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:47.510 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:50.660 

solo<00:01:48.510> solo<00:01:48.930> mid<00:01:49.200> boost<00:01:49.320> so<00:01:50.040> this<00:01:50.190> front<00:01:50.430> pickup

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
solo solo mid boost so this front pickup

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.570 
solo solo mid boost so this front pickup
here's<00:01:51.090> I<00:01:51.780> guess<00:01:52.680> it's<00:01:52.890> the<00:01:52.950> -<00:01:53.160> I<00:01:53.190> don't<00:01:53.430> really

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:53.580 
here's I guess it's the - I don't really

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:55.070 
here's I guess it's the - I don't really
know<00:01:53.700> how<00:01:53.820> the<00:01:53.880> five<00:01:54.120> way<00:01:54.300> selector<00:01:54.840> switch

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:55.080 
know how the five way selector switch

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:55.880 
know how the five way selector switch
works

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
works

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:03.380 
works
on<00:01:56.880> this<00:01:57.390> on<00:01:57.690> this<00:01:58.380> to<00:01:58.980> pick<00:01:59.670> up<00:02:02.060> this<00:02:03.060> to<00:02:03.210> pick

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
on this on this to pick up this to pick

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.480 
on this on this to pick up this to pick
up<00:02:03.480> setup<00:02:03.810> but<00:02:03.960> what<00:02:04.140> we<00:02:04.740> will<00:02:04.920> do<00:02:05.100> is<00:02:05.310> we'll

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
up setup but what we will do is we'll

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.200 
up setup but what we will do is we'll
put<00:02:05.760> a<00:02:06.770> we'll<00:02:07.770> put<00:02:07.980> all<00:02:08.010> the<00:02:08.250> specs<00:02:08.580> on<00:02:08.790> it<00:02:08.820> just

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:09.210 
put a we'll put all the specs on it just

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:10.520 
put a we'll put all the specs on it just
cut<00:02:09.510> and<00:02:09.660> paste<00:02:09.840> it<00:02:10.020> off<00:02:10.110> the<00:02:10.230> goat<00:02:10.380> and

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
cut and paste it off the goat and

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.230 
cut and paste it off the goat and
website<00:02:10.890> so<00:02:11.100> you<00:02:11.430> know<00:02:11.550> you<00:02:11.640> can<00:02:11.820> see<00:02:12.000> what's

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:12.240 
website so you know you can see what's

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.780 
website so you know you can see what's
going<00:02:12.450> on<00:02:12.540> in<00:02:13.530> the<00:02:13.650> electrics<00:02:14.010> but<00:02:14.370> here's<00:02:14.580> the

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
going on in the electrics but here's the

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:15.890 
going on in the electrics but here's the
man<00:02:15.030> this<00:02:15.180> is<00:02:15.300> really<00:02:15.510> nice

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
man this is really nice

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.830 
man this is really nice
I'm<00:02:16.650> imagining<00:02:17.010> this<00:02:17.340> a<00:02:17.550> single<00:02:18.180> coil<00:02:18.480> like

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
I'm imagining this a single coil like

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.150 
I'm imagining this a single coil like
you<00:02:18.959> can<00:02:19.080> split<00:02:19.320> the<00:02:19.440> coil<00:02:19.680> in<00:02:19.860> here<00:02:20.070> or

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
you can split the coil in here or

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:21.590 
you can split the coil in here or
something<00:02:20.400> so<00:02:20.520> it'll<00:02:20.670> be<00:02:20.790> that<00:02:21.240> was<00:02:21.390> probably

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 
something so it'll be that was probably

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.350 
something so it'll be that was probably
the<00:02:21.750> humbucking<00:02:22.170> sound<00:02:22.880> nice<00:02:23.880> and<00:02:23.910> warm<00:02:24.270> and

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
the humbucking sound nice and warm and

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.130 
the humbucking sound nice and warm and
that's<00:02:24.510> probably<00:02:24.780> the<00:02:24.870> single<00:02:25.050> core<00:02:25.410> sound

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
that's probably the single core sound

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:57.610 
that's probably the single core sound
that's<00:02:28.140> real<00:02:28.410> light<00:02:28.650> le

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:01.120 

so<00:02:58.340> that's<00:02:59.239> that<00:02:59.510> that<00:03:00.200> sets<00:03:00.440> out<00:03:00.590> an<00:03:00.769> booster

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.130 
so that's that that sets out an booster

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:08.979 
so that's that that sets out an booster
boosted<00:03:03.220> yes<00:03:04.220> nice<00:03:04.489> gets<00:03:04.730> a<00:03:04.790> real<00:03:04.970> Maui<00:03:07.989> that's

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:08.989 
boosted yes nice gets a real Maui that's

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:14.380 
boosted yes nice gets a real Maui that's
cool<00:03:09.380> booster<00:03:11.860> nice<00:03:12.860> sound<00:03:13.190> and<00:03:13.970> then<00:03:14.150> that's

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:14.390 
cool booster nice sound and then that's

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:16.210 
cool booster nice sound and then that's
the<00:03:14.569> middle<00:03:14.810> selector<00:03:15.440> switch<00:03:15.739> whatever<00:03:16.099> the

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.220 
the middle selector switch whatever the

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:18.640 
the middle selector switch whatever the
heck<00:03:16.340> that<00:03:16.370> is<00:03:16.519> probably<00:03:17.260> both<00:03:18.260> those

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650 
heck that is probably both those

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:21.220 
heck that is probably both those
together<00:03:19.280> I'm<00:03:19.700> guessing<00:03:20.120> I<00:03:20.239> have<00:03:20.510> no<00:03:20.630> idea<00:03:20.870> but

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:21.230 
together I'm guessing I have no idea but

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:24.370 
together I'm guessing I have no idea but
anyway<00:03:21.500> this<00:03:21.650> is<00:03:21.709> the<00:03:21.829> sound<00:03:22.810> I<00:03:23.810> guess<00:03:24.170> it's

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:24.380 
anyway this is the sound I guess it's

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:25.479 
anyway this is the sound I guess it's
kind<00:03:24.680> of<00:03:24.709> a<00:03:24.799> bit<00:03:24.950> more<00:03:24.980> of<00:03:25.190> an<00:03:25.250> authentic

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:25.489 
kind of a bit more of an authentic

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:59.830 
kind of a bit more of an authentic
Kelley<00:03:25.849> sound<00:03:49.480> I<00:03:50.480> wish<00:03:50.660> I<00:03:50.780> could<00:03:50.930> do<00:03:51.049> it<00:03:58.840> which

00:03:59.830 --> 00:03:59.840 
Kelley sound I wish I could do it which

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:01.449 
Kelley sound I wish I could do it which
I<00:03:59.959> can't<00:04:00.139> do<00:04:00.290> obviously<00:04:00.739> because<00:04:00.920> that<00:04:00.950> sounds

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:01.459 
I can't do obviously because that sounds

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:03.849 
I can't do obviously because that sounds
here<00:04:01.600> I<00:04:02.600> wish<00:04:03.139> I<00:04:03.200> could<00:04:03.319> do<00:04:03.440> it<00:04:03.470> finger-picking

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:03.859 
here I wish I could do it finger-picking

00:04:03.859 --> 00:04:05.740 
here I wish I could do it finger-picking
stuff<00:04:04.190> so<00:04:04.370> that's<00:04:04.609> that<00:04:04.880> sound

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:05.750 
stuff so that's that sound

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:18.729 
stuff so that's that sound
boosted<00:04:06.380> now<00:04:17.049> probably<00:04:18.049> more<00:04:18.200> authentic

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:18.739 
boosted now probably more authentic

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:21.460 
boosted now probably more authentic
sound<00:04:19.039> tell<00:04:19.250> yourself<00:04:19.549> me<00:04:20.079> just<00:04:21.079> a<00:04:21.169> bit<00:04:21.320> you

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:21.470 
sound tell yourself me just a bit you

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:32.629 
sound tell yourself me just a bit you
know<00:04:21.500> louder<00:04:21.950> yeah<00:04:22.490> although<00:04:23.419> does<00:04:23.630> punch
