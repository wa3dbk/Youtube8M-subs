 a component a module or even a 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.250
 complete body of one piece that 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.070
 in a single production process 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.529
 is made impossible altogether 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.210
 not what sounds like utopia today 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.670
 can the developers and researchers 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.529
 at edag for the automotive industry the 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.760
 already present the future 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.129
 yes we have something special 

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:36.989
 come up with new ones 

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:38.070
 considered and have production processes 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.420
 discovered that with new ones 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.489
 production process a completely different one 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.150
 dimension in body structures 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.920
 can bring 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:47.540
 and we tried that with this 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.540
 transport product 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:01:00.850

 complete production browsers including 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:16.960
 two and production of the times we 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:18.940
 have ajar against a turtle 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:21.370
 because a turtle with her tank 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:23.380
 it is ideally suited to ultimately 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:25.060
 show how occupant protection can live 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:26.860
 and with these new manufacturing processes 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:29.970
 We also have options for this 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:29.970
 to replicate structures at all 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:42.509
 Genesis is definitely not a vehicle 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.920
 it's not a concept car what you do 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.479
 Normally it is easy to know 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.950
 completely new approach to future 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.369
 Body structures produce 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.899
 can 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.740
 via so-called additive manufacturing 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.740
 method 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.039
 from the deeper conversations have become 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.509
 connecting points we give with 

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:09.099
 Safety in studies together with the 

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:11.170
 car manufacturers will work out now 

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:12.849
 and look exactly which components 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.750
 which process steps are suitable 

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:16.980
 possibly around this 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.980
 to apply the manufacturing process
