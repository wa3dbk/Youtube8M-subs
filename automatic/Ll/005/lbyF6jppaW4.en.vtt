00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.750 

hmm

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:01.760 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:10.240 

that's<00:02:02.420> on<00:02:02.540> my<00:02:02.630> mother's<00:02:03.370> no<00:02:04.370> okay

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:16.570 

yet<00:02:10.910> is<00:02:11.030> very<00:02:11.240> good

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:20.550 

so<00:02:17.210> it<00:02:17.300> doesn't<00:02:17.450> look<00:02:17.690> like<00:02:17.900> a<00:02:18.110> cross<00:02:18.980> on<00:02:19.270> but

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
so it doesn't look like a cross on but

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.620 
so it doesn't look like a cross on but
it<00:02:21.560> kind<00:02:21.800> of<00:02:21.830> tastes<00:02:22.070> like<00:02:22.160> a<00:02:22.310> croissant<00:02:22.640> which

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:23.630 
it kind of tastes like a croissant which

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:25.450 
it kind of tastes like a croissant which
is<00:02:23.810> interesting<00:02:24.410> not<00:02:24.680> sure<00:02:24.860> how<00:02:24.980> they<00:02:25.130> managed

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:25.460 
is interesting not sure how they managed

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:28.840 
is interesting not sure how they managed
to<00:02:25.580> pull<00:02:25.760> that<00:02:25.880> off<00:02:25.940> the<00:02:26.870> bun<00:02:27.050> is<00:02:27.080> very<00:02:27.850> fluffy

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:28.850 
to pull that off the bun is very fluffy

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:32.920 
to pull that off the bun is very fluffy
light<00:02:29.840> and<00:02:30.050> airy<00:02:30.290> you<00:02:31.040> can<00:02:31.190> see<00:02:31.370> in<00:02:31.460> there<00:02:31.930> so

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 
light and airy you can see in there so

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:34.990 
light and airy you can see in there so
it<00:02:32.960> does<00:02:33.440> taste<00:02:33.680> like<00:02:33.770> a<00:02:33.860> croissant<00:02:34.220> it<00:02:34.820> does

favorite parts about a croissant is the

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.979 
favorite parts about a croissant is the
outer<00:03:39.610> crust<00:03:40.610> you<00:03:41.000> know<00:03:41.120> that<00:03:41.330> it's<00:03:41.510> just<00:03:41.750> kind

00:03:41.979 --> 00:03:41.989

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:43.970 
of buttery and I really love the outer

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:47.440 
of buttery and I really love the outer
crust<00:03:44.570> of<00:03:44.750> a<00:03:44.810> croissant<00:03:45.170> so<00:03:46.090> it<00:03:47.090> was<00:03:47.209> kind<00:03:47.420> of

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:47.450 
crust of a croissant so it was kind of

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:48.910 
crust of a croissant so it was kind of
like<00:03:47.570> a<00:03:47.630> regular<00:03:47.989> hot<00:03:48.350> dog<00:03:48.530> bun<00:03:48.709> on<00:03:48.830> the

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:48.920 
like a regular hot dog bun on the

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:50.040 
like a regular hot dog bun on the
outside<00:03:49.250> and<00:03:49.310> then<00:03:49.400> it<00:03:49.519> was<00:03:49.610> just<00:03:49.760> kind<00:03:49.910> of

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:50.050 
outside and then it was just kind of

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:52.330 
outside and then it was just kind of
flaky<00:03:51.050> and<00:03:51.140> fluffy<00:03:51.470> like<00:03:51.500> a<00:03:51.650> croissant<00:03:52.040> on<00:03:52.220> the
