Hello everyone, this is Asahi

00:00:02.352 --> 00:00:06.965
Today I would like to teach you guys how 
 to easily create these SFX scars 

00:00:06.965 --> 00:00:12.638
using products that you can get from the 100yen store and the supermarket!

00:00:12.638 --> 00:00:17.573
If you dislike blood or gruesome images, if you could maybe 
 watch this with your eyes half open that'll be great!

00:00:17.573 --> 00:00:19.043
The Ingredients are

00:00:19.389 --> 00:00:27.187
Gelatine- it's used to form jelly and we will use this as the skin

00:00:27.187 --> 00:00:32.489
If you soak the gelatine when removing, it will come 
 off easily so it's fairly easy to handle

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:40.230
hot water, tissue, scissors, and a spoon will also be needed

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.246
and for making the scar look real, you will need foundation, 

00:00:44.246 --> 00:00:50.697
I was only able to find this at my local 100 yen store but i 
 think it'll look better if you use a liquid foundation like this one

00:00:50.697 --> 00:00:55.681
Watercolors in brown, black, red are a must and

00:00:55.681 --> 00:01:00.265
if you use yellow and blue, the scar can look more realistic.

00:01:00.265 --> 00:01:09.810
also, foundation sponge, dishwashing sponge, art brushes, brown 
 eyeshadows and last but not least, ketchup!

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.010
Let's get on with it!

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:17.082
Firstly, melt the gelatine with hot water

00:01:17.082 --> 00:01:22.396
You can add the same amount of water as gelatine 
 or, you can add more for a smoother consistency

00:01:22.396 --> 00:01:24.881
make sure you mix well

00:01:25.526 --> 00:01:28.673
Wait for it to cool until it's not too hot to touch

00:01:28.673 --> 00:01:33.059
take apart your 2 ply tissue then rip them up randomly 

00:01:32.674 --> 00:01:41.860
once the gelatine has cooled down a little bit, spread it over desired area *If you cool 
 the gelatine too much it will become a solid so don't let it fully cool down!!*

00:01:41.856 --> 00:01:50.420
then place a tissue on top of the gelatine.
We want to make this look 
 like skin later on so continue the process like paper mache 

00:01:55.879 --> 00:02:00.590
Once you've gotten your layer of tissue and gelatine 
 to this thickness, wait for it to dry

00:02:00.591 --> 00:02:04.650
Once it's dry, use foundation so that it 
 blends in with your natural skin 

00:02:04.654 --> 00:02:08.590
if you don't have a foundation sponge, it's 
 completely fine to use your fingers instead

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:15.900
Next, use a pair of scissors and cut open a slit 
 to where you would like your wound to be

00:02:15.902 --> 00:02:20.280
because we want an open wound, cut out a little 
 more gelatine so that the inside can be visible

00:02:21.485 --> 00:02:27.620
next, it's time to make the wound realistic with colors! 
You are 
 totally free on how you would like to do this however

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:29.700
I'd like to tell you some tips!

00:02:29.696 --> 00:02:36.420
Firstly, use the watercolors without adding water. 
This will keep the gooey 
 consistency and I think it will make the blood more realistic

00:02:36.425 --> 00:02:41.860
also, if you add too many colors, it could 
 end up looking mixed up and bland so

00:02:41.864 --> 00:02:47.120
the point is to keep each color while adding different 
 colors and giving the colors a marble like look

00:02:47.121 --> 00:02:51.240
also by using a rough sponge and patting on some color, 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:57.640
it can give the effect of internal bleeding and look 
 as if your circulation has been cut off

00:02:57.432 --> 00:03:05.550
to accentuate the bumps around the skin, add lines and 
 blend the colors with your fingers and 

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:11.380
use the eyeshadows to blend out the whole 
 wound to make it look more gruesome

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:16.960
Keep repeating this step until you've reacted your desired look and 
 I think it'll look a lot more realistic! 

00:03:19.072 --> 00:03:25.970
so, it will look something like this. The gelatine is fairly 
 dry but the wound will look pretty deep 

00:03:25.966 --> 00:03:34.360
To finish off,  I want the wound to 
 look really gooey so add some ketchup and

00:03:34.361 --> 00:03:37.440
It's complete!

00:03:45.017 --> 00:03:50.220
Today I introduced items that you can easily find 
 but if you have sensitive skin 

00:03:50.225 --> 00:03:55.090
or if you are applying it to your face, 
 or want to make the wound more realistic

00:03:55.162 --> 00:04:01.420
You can use eyeshadows, cream shadows, red lipsticks and blood paint

00:04:01.421 --> 00:04:11.040
You can also create a look just using gelatine by adding 
 some color and it will give a burnt effect

00:04:11.042 --> 00:04:13.440
well, thank you for watching till the end! 

00:04:13.437 --> 00:04:16.040
Bye~!
