00:00:00.059 --> 00:00:08.740
 to arouca will not talk about the electrical part 

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:11.299
 of his death but died 

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:16.150
 is mainly the staff three helpers to allocate marine not 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:17.640
 announced 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.080
 your house will try to schedule a snack and the battery is discharged as it is 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.359
 harmful 

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:27.509
 we put another parallel battery and what will harm it in the 

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:31.329
 electrical part of the dead I am mind she said that oil 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.810
 it is dangerous because it's battery has been totally totally discharged 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.330
 then from the moment you put another battery in parallel that 

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:44.220
 You got a bike, you did a lot of pressure. 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:48.550
 these motors begin to rotate the load to charge the battery through this 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:50.430
 highlighted piece 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:51.860
 where it is separated 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:54.280
 from load 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:55.830
 that these parties here 

00:00:55.830 --> 00:01:00.170
 and has the other two reels or three as years had gone by motorcycle 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:02.690
 to generate the energy that yields 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:06.600
 the battery control is totally wrong 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.910
 it is a requirement of the statute 

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:10.490
 a lot of current 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:12.660
 this current in a copper wire 

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:14.820
 it generates heat 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.439
 generating heat has climbed will dissipate 

00:01:17.439 --> 00:01:20.050
 through the jute rewinding will end 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:23.050
 heating coil that generate energy by civilians 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:24.580
 thereby 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:30.170
 is this movement r in a safe has a copper wire that they malted has to 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:31.300
 risk out 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:35.210
 and when you get too warm this enamel deteriorates 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:40.070
 making the wires issue next to the world's bovine side of the other in which 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:40.840
 incurs 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.429
 so it happens a lot for the person to leave 

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:44.690
 dates or time 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:48.950
 the guy left walked a little begins to overload the state was heating the 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.160
 crisis did not end with another flight erased 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:56.360
 he tries to try he tries not to get a bike and knocks 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:57.280
 very functional 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.490
 because it's overheated already 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:04.660
 movement in tenuous tenement in general attention enough to 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:06.350
 avoid the accident 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:09.839
 and with that guy will stay on hand can handle on a good day 

00:02:09.839 --> 00:02:15.389
 on a great day sailing season cover but how can you catch a day 

00:02:15.389 --> 00:02:17.619
 which is the hottest of brawn 

00:02:17.619 --> 00:02:20.809
 he does not drift because of a bullshit 

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:23.509
 when I thought it still holds that it 

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:26.379
 that theory that prevention in the pocket 

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:29.749
 it is better to decree the correction 

00:02:29.749 --> 00:02:35.209
 if it catches a battery it buys a battery of 200 if it matters 9 boot real and 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:40.699
 25 of thing he does not need to march with found that it costs two thousand reais and 

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:42.619
 You still have the time to stay at sea. 

00:02:42.619 --> 00:02:44.449
 That's why we combine 

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:45.929
 what happens a lot 

00:02:45.929 --> 00:02:47.380
 arrives at the marina 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:50.800
 another one did not pick up no strength it's no use you making a battery 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:55.489
 parallels the pacifier with the fact said it is dangerous because you will harm 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:59.519
 an engine component and ends up leaving the acronym outside 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:02.669
 and sometimes with family with children have a lot of responsibility 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.010
 It's really okay to check this out. 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:09.329
 before a day before in pro-marina 

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:14.069
 I beat the battery increase still have a useful life or not that we beyond 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:16.979
 sustainability 

00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:18.659
 if you through meetings 

00:03:18.659 --> 00:03:20.359
 spinning them 

00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:24.250
 benfica walked motorcycle did not take well that you are already accompanying 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:27.409
 and will not get caught off guard 

00:03:27.409 --> 00:03:31.359
 or gets to the point of doing a kind of thing like a pacifier like pie and 

00:03:31.359 --> 00:03:33.939
 that's how I came out in life that's not how it works 

00:03:33.939 --> 00:03:35.410
 bribe 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:39.980
 cost of 100 of the antibiotics we talked about the fact of being during duty a 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:43.389
 effective prevention works well for the pocket 

00:03:43.389 --> 00:03:48.889
 way people end up not having this disorder of going out by 1 to 0 and 

00:03:48.889 --> 00:03:51.069
 bother 

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:52.349
 that's it folks 

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:53.949
 preventing is still the best deal
