00:00:01.639 --> 00:00:05.339
 and there is a person telling truth on the ring for the first time 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:08.520
 Both classes were the big and the small the West the vision in common 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:13.289
 started but before it even started something to celebrate Dieter dam something 

00:00:13.289 --> 00:00:16.480
 tell us 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:21.279
 Hedwig Fehren of the six people as optimistic as in 1972 as 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:22.470
 Race Director Cottbus 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.189
 a new auspicious race series in the curve of Nordire 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:27.390
 had started 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.109
 These four drivers have the ten-year history of German racing 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.370
 Championship almost made up among themselves 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:36.240
 they won seven out of ten titles to be awarded 

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:39.910
 Klaus Ludvig Hans-joachim Stuck Dieter Glemser and Hans Maier 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.660
 Stoke won not only the first race but also the first title 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.740
 his time as a BMW Coupé the strongest car in the field at that time 

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:55.890
 Stuck has 370 hp today in the BMW m1 over 1 800 horsepower 

00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:00.640
 In the meantime the cars have not only become more colorful but also more expensive 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.250
 At that time so Weissmann was a competitive one still for 70 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:09.490
 000 today, there are more than 350000 market prices make the 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:11.630
 current problematic transparent 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:13.080
 cost explosion 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.080
 by administrator of the regulations 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.300
 whether championship, it is legitimate her child the German victim 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:28.010
 more still the Cypriot marriage 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:31.740
 Men like Jochen Neerpasch and half a dozen others have them next to her 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.270
 made Formula 1 the most attractive racing series in Europe 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:39.179
 Scandals and the Eco is the works must the unmanageable rules 

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:41.820
 two divisions to reform in time 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.740
 concretes their existence 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.740
 Harald Terpe stayed on the Spree 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.460
 The problem with the city championship is that he is equal to one 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.300
 very few sponsors have 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:07.360
 how to have and to have a very good sponsor in the lucky situation 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.249
 actively drives motorsport 

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:12.559
 At Porsche, moreover, the factory is supposed to have motorsport even there 

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:16.479
 no lenders who support the private teams so far just in this 

00:02:16.479 --> 00:02:19.479
 Mastery can continue to share that is our problem 

00:02:20.189 --> 00:02:23.469
 by living together both divisions refer the competition here 

00:02:23.469 --> 00:02:24.049
 have brought 

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:25.809
 again used to the interest 

00:02:25.809 --> 00:02:28.130
 an anniversary something unusual 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:30.790
 A driver should be here twelve months ago 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:32.249
 as a bad luck felt 

00:02:32.249 --> 00:02:35.879
 in reality mobilized on an army of guardian angels 

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:37.249
 do you remember 

00:02:37.249 --> 00:02:40.239
 He believes that now a year since she received her famous Luginger 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:42.319
 have made 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:45.269
 in the week-long preparation but need to place or is that all 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:46.599
 to forget 

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:48.599
 are by 

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:51.769
 Burgess and the new company shaped extravagant a car 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:56.769
 and us through such show 2 4 and used 

00:02:56.769 --> 00:02:59.609
 to win this game but I am there 

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:02.609
 Today is also the fastest 

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:05.719
 because it did not feel that way 

00:03:05.719 --> 00:03:07.929
 but nothing out of it 

00:03:07.929 --> 00:03:11.829
 a cold wind blew up here at the start and finish in sunny weather 

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:12.859
 20 

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:14.609
 8 kilometers long eifel course it 

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:17.100
 50,000 spectators on a race day 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:19.919
 cost the organizers a million marks 

00:03:19.919 --> 00:03:23.019
 the field of 47 starters from both divisions 

00:03:25.369 --> 00:03:27.249
 in the first row with 

00:03:27.249 --> 00:03:29.679
 April with 600 hp Manfred 

00:03:29.679 --> 00:03:32.680
 next to him in the 700 hp Porsche Boxter leak 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:36.099
 on the other places Klaus Ludwig in the second 

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:39.940
 Hans-joachim Stuck in the 800 hp BMW m1 and Hans Maier 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:42.940
 the defending champion in Launcher Beta 

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:48.269
 after a successful start in the South Tyrolean Bolzano 

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:50.479
 but hans-joachim stucco 

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:52.349
 Klaus Ludwig Hans celebrates 

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:55.709
 and Sandy Müller Junior the son of the former 2 

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:08.929
 the start of the race is seven laps, the equivalent of 159 

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:13.569
 Felix Genn 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:20.799
 for competition sites 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:23.799
 although I always crowded 

00:04:29.779 --> 00:04:32.779
 on 

00:04:36.789 --> 00:04:39.509
 although I still exist 

00:04:39.509 --> 00:04:40.809
 here at a time 

00:04:40.809 --> 00:04:44.479
 July at the airfield at the site at the Winkeler a year ago 

00:04:44.479 --> 00:04:47.479
 Flying skills made in the truest sense of the word 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:51.719
 still want a duel 

00:04:51.719 --> 00:04:53.419
 not just pushing the prices 

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:56.719
 Often, the benefits have changed in the past decade 

00:04:56.719 --> 00:04:59.719
 conditioned by the evolution of the population of animals 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:02.800
 the fastest 

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:06.429
 under Frank 50 kilometers per hour so it was yesterday in training 

00:05:08.719 --> 00:05:11.690
 these are only a few kilometers below that of Niki Lauda 

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:14.659
 1975 set best time 

00:05:14.659 --> 00:05:16.949
 in a formula 1 car 

00:05:16.949 --> 00:05:21.309
 and here Manfred Winkelhock has before the end of the first round 

00:05:21.309 --> 00:05:24.309
 the lead in front of him though 

00:05:36.809 --> 00:05:38.120
 your own ranks 

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:39.719
 Newcomer to the group 5 

00:05:39.719 --> 00:05:42.719
 only after the first round of the boxes 

00:05:43.979 --> 00:05:46.719
 The story of the race is now quickly told 

00:05:46.719 --> 00:05:48.210
 Manfred Winkelhock 

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:52.080
 Once cultivation Frolik was passing increasingly faster before in the second 

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:58.150
 Kilometers per hour 

00:05:58.150 --> 00:05:59.860
 record-breaking 

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:02.860
 and love to finish what no 

00:06:23.509 --> 00:06:26.979
 Franz Maier the master soon had problems with his 5th 

00:06:26.979 --> 00:06:29.080
 he fell back to fifth 

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:30.930
 several times it was still dusting 

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:32.819
 there were billiards 

00:06:32.819 --> 00:06:35.199
 in the industry's usual limits 

00:06:35.199 --> 00:06:37.240
 here it is Klaus Niedzwiedz 

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:40.270
 valuable 

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:43.629
 Sigi Müller 

00:06:43.629 --> 00:06:46.550
 during the championship leader Klaus Ludwig 

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:47.520
 stayed cool 

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:49.699
 his fourth place 

00:06:49.699 --> 00:06:53.319
 how free is the visionary Winkelhock role defended plot 

00:06:55.389 --> 00:06:57.399
 the first and second divisions 

00:06:57.399 --> 00:07:00.039
 no trap in this race 

00:07:00.039 --> 00:07:02.869
 so it should be responsible for him 

00:07:02.869 --> 00:07:06.519
 look in the near future, even if they are still considered separately 

00:07:07.909 --> 00:07:11.599
 Manfred Winkelhock is happy about the Great Depression 

00:07:14.819 --> 00:07:18.270
 with his success with the little ones before Müller and celebrate 

00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:19.580
 maybe up 

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:22.800
 continues to be the leader 

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:25.130
 the championship was still 4 ahead 

00:07:25.130 --> 00:07:30.050
 13 runs at a glance is for cloud with 80 points in front of Bonn EK 65 

00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:34.030
 Tannheimer 57 and Manfred Winkelhock with 52 points
