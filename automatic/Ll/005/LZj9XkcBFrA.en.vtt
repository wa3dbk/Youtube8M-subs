 at the level of the mound-red metal doors are installed by the 

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:10.420

 Party 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.720
 in three hours they must mount the safety rails 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:22.060
 but not only 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:23.400
 finally the value 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.730
 its flora 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:27.730
 not to allow farmers including the four children of the white queen 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:31.110
 this victory that the return of the attacker the bar otherwise 

00:00:31.659 --> 00:00:35.460
 a few kilometers further he believes that the leaders of both parties 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.060
 launches negotiations 

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:41.010
 the point of contention is this badge that the technopark distributes for the 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.240
 motorists who wish to park for free near the circuit 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.980
 for the philo no question of tolerating this initiative 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:51.810
 in the early afternoon an agreement is found 

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:54.810
 status quo for the next two years but with one condition 

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:57.470
 there should not be more than 4000 t 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:59.670
 in the compound of the technoparc 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.930
 side circuit they are preparing for the free practice of the afternoon 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:07.770
 the honda driver who mostly cares the visitors were mechanics 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.770
 mechanics have much more than six months of their lives 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:18.670

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.000
 and if the pressure 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
 my little by little some remain zen 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:36.830
 and we find michelle pfeiffer duplex top circuit 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.789
 for samy who has the gift be a good night yesterday so the first info of 

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:46.619
 the day is that there to achieve it in 2009 has already been beaten 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.770
 and yes and this is the franck montagny was shot down on 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.850
 this pole he achieved the feat 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:58.720
 hdecommer in 3'22 876 is 12 thousandths two months she stéphane sarrazin in 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:02.340
 August 2009 note that stéphane sarrazin is today the teammate 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.380
 of franck montagny on Peugeot number 2 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:10.500
 in e1 it is necessary to get used to audi is placed in third position for the moment to 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.120
 this man christ is a scene that achieves this score 3 25 'and then the 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.979
 red flag and already out 

00:02:16.979 --> 00:02:18.969
 already witte 

00:02:18.969 --> 00:02:22.399
 e the swiss swiss romanian pilot grosjean she performed a 

00:02:22.399 --> 00:02:26.369
 head-to-tail at the turn of the porsche adorent of his ford of i 

00:02:26.369 --> 00:02:31.729
 been number 1 60 l stable my head competition to start so scenes 

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:35.269
 free on the stone rock hats then you were on the circuit all 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:39.260
 the unique day and tell us a little about the western atmosphere last then 

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:42.919
 the atmosphere and gradually build it as you go 

00:02:42.919 --> 00:02:44.329
 a day in the stands 

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:47.959
 percent at the beginning well we have a finished name in stanley the signs of 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:52.450
 each style for his colleague the esstic hours on the ground the marks on which 

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:56.059
 the cars stop when she returns to each booth to check 

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:58.989
 customer gasoline stocks repeated gestures and gestures 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:02.529
 essentials that need to be worse this to change the tires or make a 

00:03:02.529 --> 00:03:07.069
 full of gas all she was reported without a car and in front of an audience 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:09.959
 more and more important in front of more and more journalists 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:13.119
 until 3.30 pm when the commissioners were evacuated the apic 

00:03:13.119 --> 00:03:17.159
 legacy of the pit straight at 4 pm it was the beginning of this 

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:18.919
 free practice session 

00:03:18.919 --> 00:03:22.359
 so what do we expect from them the eight teams the stables I you 

00:03:22.359 --> 00:03:27.799
 proposes to listen gerard will do it and he was head design wr manager 

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:30.799
 and then sébastien bourdais we do not introduce you anymore 

00:03:31.969 --> 00:03:33.139
 m 

00:03:33.139 --> 00:03:35.009
 circuit for a long time 

00:03:35.009 --> 00:03:37.419
 that's the important thing 

00:03:37.419 --> 00:03:40.419
 not only for us in technical 

00:03:41.419 --> 00:03:43.489
 especially for pilots 

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:46.579
 we have pilots who will discover the circuit 

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:48.719
 so it's very important to ride on this circuit 

00:03:48.719 --> 00:03:51.849
 alas if the conditions are those on the site to refine the car the 

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:53.070
 more possible for 

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:56.000
 is the easiest injury to drive and faster for them to 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.740
 relays for the race since the yard will be essentially chr odienné 

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:02.469
 to shampoo big turmoil at the weather level 

00:04:02.469 --> 00:04:05.509
 his heart is the most important is going to be the ferment of small missiles 

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:08.989
 the time we have on the dry and after us there is no big surprise 

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:11.699
 in the car we know it pretty well we did not change much 

00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:15.219
 level of this index is that small improvements on the fate of the years 

00:04:15.219 --> 00:04:18.910
 but the club has now it's mostly to take the right benchmarks decides 

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:23.249
 to date it as much as possible to the external conditions of the rent 

00:04:23.249 --> 00:04:25.090
 probably the sexiest pc 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:28.910
 so sébastien brothel that the weather will obviously be a factor not 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:31.870
 important role of the race and yes the weather is a 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:33.650
 decisive factor remember that 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:35.450
 the Peugeot two years ago and was failing 

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:38.990
 almost in the last hour because of a bad choice of tires 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:41.520
 the weather was uncertain on some parts of the circuit were raining 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:45.660
 on others no these choices are very important today the weather essec 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:48.610
 but the weather is uncertain and in the teams we do not like at all a time 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:49.889
 uncertain 

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:53.840
 according to peugeot meteorologists the weather will be dry and saturday 

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:57.389
 today it is dry and therefore the assurance of facts to be 

00:04:57.389 --> 00:05:01.750
 president gilles for Saturday's race the right settings will be made 

00:05:01.749 --> 00:05:05.810
 taking into account this criterion of dry weather or the second session 

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:09.189
 of tests that will take place tomorrow will be in the rain and from 

00:05:09.189 --> 00:05:12.180
 there things are much worse and the tests 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:15.930
 must be done today so that the court runs at best 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:19.190
 for the team but who knows why not the pole position could already 

00:05:19.189 --> 00:05:20.690
 be known that it is 

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:24.050
 obviously thank you very much to mickaël we will obviously come back on all 

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:27.339
 these elements and other editions 

00:05:27.339 --> 00:05:32.589
 tomorrow on this first night qualifying tomorrow Thursday where will be played so 

00:05:32.589 --> 00:05:35.589
 maybe here the pole with them new qualifying sessions 

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:41.600
 from 7 pm to 9 pm more than 10 pm to midnight between the two 

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:46.720
 spectators will not be able to risk a demonstration of cars of the future 

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:52.039
 to alternative energy and then remember the evening show will be 

00:05:52.039 --> 00:05:54.750
 insured by the state expect to see the world
