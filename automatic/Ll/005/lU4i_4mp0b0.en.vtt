into<00:00:51.719> planetside<00:00:52.170> 2<00:00:52.320> specifically<00:00:53.010> it<00:00:53.219> only

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
into planetside 2 specifically it only

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.270 
into planetside 2 specifically it only
draws<00:00:54.149> data<00:00:54.480> from<00:00:54.930> the<00:00:55.079> Census<00:00:55.469> API<00:00:55.890> and

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
draws data from the Census API and

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.180 
draws data from the Census API and
that's<00:00:56.730> why<00:00:57.059> the<00:00:57.120> API<00:00:57.629> exists<00:00:58.320> so<00:00:58.829> that<00:00:58.859> we<00:00:59.070> can

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
that's why the API exists so that we can

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.160 
that's why the API exists so that we can
do<00:00:59.280> cool<00:00:59.460> things<00:00:59.520> like<00:00:59.760> this<00:01:00.000> so<00:01:00.570> if<00:01:00.930> you'd

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
do cool things like this so if you'd

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.689 
do cool things like this so if you'd
like<00:01:01.199> to<00:01:01.379> help<00:01:01.530> test<00:01:01.949> the<00:01:02.070> program<00:01:02.430> or<00:01:02.579> if<00:01:02.640> you

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
like to help test the program or if you

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:03.619 
like to help test the program or if you
just<00:01:02.730> want<00:01:03.000> to<00:01:03.059> find<00:01:03.270> out<00:01:03.390> more<00:01:03.570> information

subscriber link this forum posted me and

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.289 
subscriber link this forum posted me and
I<00:01:10.619> thought<00:01:10.770> it<00:01:10.890> was<00:01:11.070> maybe<00:01:11.790> a<00:01:11.939> little<00:01:12.119> bit

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
I thought it was maybe a little bit

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.450 
I thought it was maybe a little bit
hyperbolic<00:01:12.720> but<00:01:13.290> the<00:01:13.409> guy<00:01:13.530> basically<00:01:13.770> sums<00:01:14.280> up

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
hyperbolic but the guy basically sums up

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.609 
hyperbolic but the guy basically sums up
why<00:01:14.729> you<00:01:14.760> should<00:01:15.119> not<00:01:15.299> buy<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:16.200> MKV

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
why you should not buy the MKV

why you should not buy the MKV
suppressed<00:01:17.250> and<00:01:17.460> these<00:01:18.330> are<00:01:18.509> basically<00:01:18.869> the

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
suppressed and these are basically the

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.840 
suppressed and these are basically the
same<00:01:19.200> reasons<00:01:19.590> that<00:01:19.650> I<00:01:19.770> don't<00:01:20.130> want<00:01:20.430> to<00:01:20.549> review

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
in life or now and it just figured that

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.950 
in life or now and it just figured that
it<00:01:56.759> was<00:01:56.850> worth<00:01:57.030> sharing

00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:58.960 
it was worth sharing

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.789 
it was worth sharing
in<00:01:59.500> I<00:02:00.070> guess<00:02:00.340> more<00:02:00.820> competitive<00:02:01.540> news<00:02:01.869> eg<00:02:02.560> and

in I guess more competitive news eg and

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:04.440 
in I guess more competitive news eg and

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
interested in watching this unfold but

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:39.960 
interested in watching this unfold but
it<00:02:38.739> really<00:02:38.950> wouldn't<00:02:39.190> surprise<00:02:39.250> me<00:02:39.489> if<00:02:39.790> this

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
it really wouldn't surprise me if this

about<00:02:41.680> it<00:02:41.950> for<00:02:42.489> a<00:02:42.519> long<00:02:42.670> while<00:02:43.890> getting<00:02:44.890> back

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
about it for a long while getting back

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:46.080

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:17.920 
the current setup and it feels like it's

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:19.740 
the current setup and it feels like it's
more<00:03:18.160> of<00:03:18.400> a<00:03:18.489> tacked-on<00:03:18.790> addition<00:03:19.329> to<00:03:19.450> the<00:03:19.570> game

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750 
more of a tacked-on addition to the game

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:21.780

when a couple of easy changes could make
it<00:03:21.910> feel<00:03:22.090> much<00:03:22.360> more<00:03:22.570> integrated<00:03:22.959> and

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:23.170 
it feel much more integrated and

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:25.830 
it feel much more integrated and
potentially<00:03:24.040> less<00:03:24.250> frustrating<00:03:24.850> maybe<00:03:25.720> I'll

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840
