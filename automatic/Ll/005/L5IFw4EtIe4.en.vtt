00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:29.890
 today the average inhabitant 

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:33.450
 went to buy a light bulb 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:33.450
 with a power of 100 watts 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.629
 madam the average inhabitant she is 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:46.620
 alley buy to her hair to dry 

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:49.420
 his hair power 1000 watts 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:53.980
 that is, a kilowatt since 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:55.960
 a thousand things is said a kilo thing the 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:57.970
 sir the railways wanted 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:01.110
 of a locomotive to pull his complexion to 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:01.110
 130 kilometers per hour 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:08.050
 power of the locomotive life millions 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:09.580
 of watts 8 million watts or if you 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:11.409
 prefer 8 megawatts 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:14.320
 given that a million things are 

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:17.800
 says a mega thing what kilowatts 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:18.479
 megawatts it's the power of 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:22.390
 appliances 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:24.430
 what they can do and for the 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:27.369
 moment they do not do anything they are not 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:30.909
 connected to the network the network 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:34.270
 yet is ready in the power plants 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:36.490
 alternators turn the alternators you 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:40.270
 submits leman who turns in front of 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:43.000
 coils in practice obviously 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:44.830
 this image of alternator would be a little 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.039
 closer to reality but the principle 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:47.039
 is the same 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:51.929
 the coils is called the stator 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:58.380
 which in reality is a 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:58.380
 electromagnet its trouble the rotor 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.579
 he turns for example to fifteen thousand 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.259
 minute turns and the stator delivers a 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:09.300
 three-phase AC power one 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:11.730
 frequency of 50 Hz exactly 7 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:14.690
 alternator ci has maximum power 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:17.430
 900 megawatts 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:19.830
 but currently tells us the messin the 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.510
 central it only works at 30% of its 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:23.280
 300 megawatt power 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.150
 that is to say that she puts all alone 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.489
 is being run 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:29.660
 the equivalent of 300 miles her hair 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:29.660
 1 kilo watt each 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.690
 but you can imagine that if there is 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:39.700
 300 megawatts coming out of 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:41.260
 the alternator it is necessary that there is 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.150
 a machine at least as powerful 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:53.140
 to rotate it there is no 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:54.959
 miracle but what machine in the 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:57.270
 power plants it's still a turbine 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:59.560
 but what with the touring party 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:02.860
 this is where the gentlemen of the power plants 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:06.100
 splits into two schools on one side the 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:07.450
 hydraulicians so called because he 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:12.070
 have to turn their turbines with 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:14.019
 water from rivers and dams the 

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:15.519
 others spin it with steam 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:18.570
 they manufacture by heating water 

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:18.570
 in a boiler 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:25.870
 these are called thermists 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:28.030
 they also divide into two the 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:30.640
 classic thermist who heats his 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:35.500
 boiler with petroleum coal from 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:38.860
 gas the other the nuclear thermist himself 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:39.459
 serves as a reactor but let's go back to our 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:43.950
 power plant 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:43.950
 she still debits her 300 megawatts 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:50.319
 suppose all of a sudden 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:51.760
 forty locals that plugs in more 

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:55.390
 300 miles hair dryer already 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:58.270
 plugged in that makes a total of 600 megawatts 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:59.980
 what does the network claim if your central 

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:03.100
 is alone in supplying 300 megawatts 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:05.530
 this is not enough anymore you have to increase the 

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:08.140
 power our sir if the 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:10.870
 hydraulicians open the arrival valve 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:12.610
 of water if the thermists and louvre 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:14.560
 the arrival of steam without forgetting 

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:18.450
 sure to push the fires and open 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:18.450
 also the arrival of fuel 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:25.330
 the power of the machine increases 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:27.920
 the alternator releases its 600 megawatts 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:34.520
 maintains its speed and the 50 hertz 

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:37.010
 very exactly in practice all 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:38.840
 this is automatic where no one 

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:40.310
 noticing anything except of course the 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:42.950
 thermist who sees his consumption 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:44.990
 fuel increases and where you 

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:49.400
 hydraulics hers who sees her reserve 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:53.530
 of tc mail or in principle it does not cost 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:55.580
 nothing then if we do not cost anything 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:56.260
 why not do power plants site 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:05:01.010
 roddick 

00:04:56.260 --> 00:05:04.240
 it would be much more economical where we 

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:04.240
 will see that next time
