I'll<00:01:57.670> explain<00:01:58.330> this<00:01:58.540> feature<00:01:58.930> in<00:01:59.140> a<00:01:59.230> second

00:01:59.520 --> 00:01:59.530 
I'll explain this feature in a second

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:03.510 
I'll explain this feature in a second
but<00:02:00.190> first<00:02:00.520> off<00:02:00.760> on<00:02:00.970> the<00:02:01.360> Mogu<00:02:02.160> framerate<00:02:03.160> I

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:03.520 
but first off on the Mogu framerate I

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:04.140 
but first off on the Mogu framerate I
guess

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:04.150 
guess

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:06.810 
guess
it's<00:02:04.510> got<00:02:04.690> something<00:02:04.900> to<00:02:04.930> do<00:02:05.170> with<00:02:05.560> the<00:02:05.860> the

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:06.820 
it's got something to do with the the

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:09.960 
it's got something to do with the the
type<00:02:07.030> of<00:02:07.060> camera<00:02:07.750> you<00:02:07.960> have<00:02:08.170> and<00:02:08.729> I'm<00:02:09.729> pretty

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 
type of camera you have and I'm pretty

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:12.990 
type of camera you have and I'm pretty
sure<00:02:10.060> for<00:02:10.570> the<00:02:10.660> iPhone<00:02:10.990> 4s<00:02:11.290> you<00:02:11.890> you<00:02:12.670> can<00:02:12.820> only

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
sure for the iPhone 4s you you can only

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.080 
sure for the iPhone 4s you you can only
shoot<00:02:13.330> in<00:02:13.630> 30<00:02:14.260> frames<00:02:14.500> per<00:02:14.650> second<00:02:15.010> I<00:02:15.190> think

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
shoot in 30 frames per second I think

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:18.180 
shoot in 30 frames per second I think
yeah<00:02:16.420> I<00:02:16.450> think<00:02:16.630> that's<00:02:16.840> how<00:02:16.930> it<00:02:17.050> works<00:02:17.230> but<00:02:18.130> the

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
yeah I think that's how it works but the

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:23.670 
yeah I think that's how it works but the
iPhone<00:02:18.550> 5s<00:02:19.450> I<00:02:20.320> think<00:02:21.310> can<00:02:21.460> record<00:02:21.940> at<00:02:22.120> 120<00:02:22.900> fps

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
iPhone 5s I think can record at 120 fps

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.930 
iPhone 5s I think can record at 120 fps
as<00:02:23.950> it<00:02:24.070> says<00:02:24.220> here<00:02:25.680> yeah<00:02:26.680> so<00:02:26.920> 30<00:02:27.430> frames<00:02:27.790> per

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
as it says here yeah so 30 frames per

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.210 
as it says here yeah so 30 frames per
second<00:02:28.330> is<00:02:28.450> advised<00:02:28.750> for<00:02:29.140> I<00:02:29.200> for<00:02:29.830> the<00:02:29.920> iPhone

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
second is advised for I for the iPhone

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:37.760 
second is advised for I for the iPhone
4s<00:02:30.459> and<00:02:31.140> as<00:02:32.140> you<00:02:32.290> can<00:02:32.470> see<00:02:35.250> and<00:02:36.250> here<00:02:36.610> it<00:02:36.940> shows

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 
4s and as you can see and here it shows

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:40.920 
4s and as you can see and here it shows
this<00:02:38.770> is<00:02:38.860> a<00:02:38.890> slo-mo<00:02:39.430> range<00:02:39.700> 0.25<00:02:40.420> is<00:02:40.720> that's

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
this is a slo-mo range 0.25 is that's

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:46.830 
this is a slo-mo range 0.25 is that's
the<00:02:41.110> normal<00:02:42.100> set<00:02:43.920> with<00:02:44.920> a<00:02:44.950> slo-mo<00:02:45.400> and<00:02:45.780> here<00:02:46.780> it

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
the normal set with a slo-mo and here it

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:51.630 
the normal set with a slo-mo and here it
says<00:02:46.989> 60<00:02:47.410> times<00:02:47.700> 0.25<00:02:48.700> equals<00:02:48.970> 15<00:02:49.780> fps<00:02:50.280> so<00:02:51.280> yeah

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 
says 60 times 0.25 equals 15 fps so yeah

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:53.720 
says 60 times 0.25 equals 15 fps so yeah
that's<00:02:51.760> how<00:02:51.910> it's<00:02:52.150> going<00:02:52.269> to<00:02:52.360> turn<00:02:52.480> out<00:02:52.690> like

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
that's how it's going to turn out like

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.600 
that's how it's going to turn out like
you<00:02:54.730> can<00:02:54.940> just<00:02:54.970> press<00:02:55.650> for<00:02:56.650> slow-mo<00:02:57.280> for<00:02:57.489> all

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:57.610 
you can just press for slow-mo for all

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:00.570 
you can just press for slow-mo for all
videos<00:02:58.290> this<00:02:59.290> feature<00:02:59.530> basically<00:02:59.920> allows<00:03:00.280> you

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310 
to add and add the slow-motion effect to

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:04.920 
to add and add the slow-motion effect to
any<00:03:03.610> video<00:03:03.880> that<00:03:04.030> you<00:03:04.209> already<00:03:04.420> have<00:03:04.630> on<00:03:04.870> your

00:03:48.899 --> 00:03:48.909 
shooting 30 frames per second because

00:03:48.909 --> 00:03:51.720 
shooting 30 frames per second because
that's<00:03:49.269> all<00:03:49.390> my<00:03:49.510> phone<00:03:49.720> can<00:03:49.840> do<00:03:50.400> all<00:03:51.400> right<00:03:51.549> so

00:03:53.759 --> 00:03:53.769 
once once you go to your photos and

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:56.690 
once once you go to your photos and
videos<00:03:54.209> it's<00:03:55.209> gonna<00:03:55.540> obviously<00:03:55.810> come<00:03:56.230> up<00:03:56.319> with

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:56.700 
videos it's gonna obviously come up with

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:59.309 
videos it's gonna obviously come up with
this<00:03:57.700> way<00:03:58.329> I<00:03:58.359> don't<00:03:58.510> know<00:03:58.690> if<00:03:58.780> you<00:03:58.870> can<00:03:59.019> see

00:03:59.309 --> 00:03:59.319 
this way I don't know if you can see

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:02.819 
this way I don't know if you can see

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:02.829 
that but I'll just zoom in that bar

00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:06.509 
that but I'll just zoom in that bar
right<00:04:02.859> there<00:04:03.370> in<00:04:04.359> between<00:04:04.989> these<00:04:05.680> bars<00:04:05.980> that

00:04:06.509 --> 00:04:06.519 
right there in between these bars that

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:08.460 
right there in between these bars that
is<00:04:06.639> going<00:04:06.790> to<00:04:06.849> be<00:04:06.940> the<00:04:07.060> stuff<00:04:07.569> part<00:04:07.930> where<00:04:08.109> it

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:08.470 
is going to be the stuff part where it

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:13.199 
is going to be the stuff part where it
is<00:04:08.680> slowed<00:04:09.400> down<00:04:10.019> so<00:04:11.340> all<00:04:12.340> you're<00:04:12.489> gonna<00:04:12.549> do<00:04:12.819> is

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:13.209 
is slowed down so all you're gonna do is

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:17.969 
is slowed down so all you're gonna do is
just<00:04:15.750> add<00:04:16.750> where<00:04:17.109> you<00:04:17.199> want<00:04:17.350> the<00:04:17.440> slow<00:04:17.620> motion

00:04:17.969 --> 00:04:17.979 
just add where you want the slow motion

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:19.800 
just add where you want the slow motion
effect<00:04:18.280> to<00:04:18.370> kick<00:04:18.519> in<00:04:18.760> throughout<00:04:19.449> the<00:04:19.570> video

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:19.810 
effect to kick in throughout the video

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:23.029 
effect to kick in throughout the video
and<00:04:20.320> obviously<00:04:20.799> this<00:04:21.190> is<00:04:21.250> in<00:04:21.400> a<00:04:21.789> proper<00:04:22.030> video

00:04:23.029 --> 00:04:23.039 
and obviously this is in a proper video

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:26.790 
and obviously this is in a proper video
but<00:04:24.039> I<00:04:24.190> will<00:04:24.520> show<00:04:25.150> one<00:04:25.449> after<00:04:26.139> I<00:04:26.380> finish<00:04:26.680> this

yeah that's basically it so I'll just

00:04:34.599 --> 00:04:46.730 
yeah that's basically it so I'll just
clearly<00:04:34.960> play<00:04:35.169> this

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:46.740 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:50.820 

still<00:04:47.740> in<00:04:47.830> slow<00:04:47.949> motion<00:04:49.259> and<00:04:50.259> yep

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:50.830 
still in slow motion and yep

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:55.290 
still in slow motion and yep
it<00:04:51.039> even<00:04:51.310> has<00:04:52.770> it<00:04:53.770> even<00:04:54.039> has<00:04:54.250> the<00:04:54.280> UM<00:04:54.699> slow

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:55.300 
it even has it even has the UM slow

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:57.600 
it even has it even has the UM slow
motion<00:04:55.689> part<00:04:55.900> in<00:04:56.139> and<00:04:56.409> out<00:04:56.560> where<00:04:57.250> I<00:04:57.280> don't

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:57.610 
motion part in and out where I don't
