believe<00:02:46.170> these<00:02:46.470> two<00:02:46.650> images<00:02:46.860> could<00:02:47.400> be<00:02:47.580> from

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
believe these two images could be from

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:50.990 
believe these two images could be from
the<00:02:47.940> 30s<00:02:48.420> version<00:02:49.019> because<00:02:49.769> they<00:02:50.069> do<00:02:50.130> seem<00:02:50.760> not

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
the 30s version because they do seem not

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.690 
the 30s version because they do seem not
to<00:02:51.030> be<00:02:51.180> HD<00:02:51.750> they<00:02:51.989> seem<00:02:52.200> to<00:02:52.230> be<00:02:52.530> sub<00:02:52.920> HD<00:02:53.370> again

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
to be HD they seem to be sub HD again

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.110 
to be HD they seem to be sub HD again
which<00:02:54.269> is<00:02:54.450> like<00:02:54.630> 480<00:02:55.080> p<00:02:55.350> 2<00:02:55.560> 540<00:02:56.250> p<00:02:56.459> so<00:02:56.730> somewhere
