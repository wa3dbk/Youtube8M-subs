you to be to integrate
and<00:00:44.429> use<00:00:44.579> your<00:00:44.609> wheel

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:46.670 
and use your wheel

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:49.299 
and use your wheel

00:00:49.299 --> 00:00:49.309 
do a little volume control but we also

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:50.590 
do a little volume control but we also
take<00:00:49.579> advantage<00:00:49.730> of<00:00:50.030> things<00:00:50.239> that<00:00:50.360> you<00:00:50.450> have

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:50.600 
take advantage of things that you have

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.150 
take advantage of things that you have
with<00:00:50.780> the<00:00:50.840> touch<00:00:50.870> surface<00:00:51.170> of<00:00:51.470> the<00:00:51.530> iPad<00:00:51.890> so

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:52.160 
with the touch surface of the iPad so

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.540 
with the touch surface of the iPad so
for<00:00:52.370> instance<00:00:52.760> I<00:00:52.940> can<00:00:53.390> grab<00:00:53.750> an<00:00:53.870> effect<00:00:54.550> and

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:55.550 
for instance I can grab an effect and

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:57.069 
for instance I can grab an effect and
throw<00:00:55.820> it<00:00:55.910> on<00:00:55.970> the<00:00:56.030> song<00:00:56.269> over<00:00:56.449> here<00:00:56.660> so<00:00:56.809> I<00:00:56.870> have

00:00:57.069 --> 00:00:57.079 
throw it on the song over here so I have

00:00:57.079 --> 00:00:59.680 
throw it on the song over here so I have
a<00:00:57.110> flanger<00:00:57.559> effect<00:00:58.329> and<00:00:59.329> we're<00:00:59.420> going<00:00:59.540> to<00:00:59.570> use

00:00:59.680 --> 00:00:59.690 
a flanger effect and we're going to use

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:04.960 
a flanger effect and we're going to use
our<00:00:59.809> button<00:01:00.079> over<00:01:00.230> here

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:04.970 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:10.330 

I'm<00:01:05.970> painting<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:06.360> parameter<00:01:06.870> of<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:07.020> impact

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:10.340 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:18.550 

path<00:01:11.340> recovery<00:01:11.820> good

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.080 

maybe<00:01:19.560> you<00:01:19.650> wanna<00:01:19.770> add<00:01:20.400> an<00:01:20.520> echo<00:01:20.700> to<00:01:20.730> that<00:01:20.940> as

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
maybe you wanna add an echo to that as

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.190 
maybe you wanna add an echo to that as
well<00:01:21.240> so<00:01:21.540> I'm<00:01:21.600> going<00:01:21.750> to<00:01:21.780> use<00:01:21.900> a<00:01:21.990> touchscreen

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
well so I'm going to use a touchscreen

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:28.860 
well so I'm going to use a touchscreen
now

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:28.870 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:31.030 

so<00:01:29.870> three<00:01:30.140> different<00:01:30.230> effects<00:01:30.620> at<00:01:30.740> the<00:01:30.770> same

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:31.040 
so three different effects at the same

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:35.590 
so three different effects at the same
time<00:01:31.310> on<00:01:31.520> one<00:01:31.700> track<00:01:31.940> with<00:01:32.210> the<00:01:32.300> iPad

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:36.940 

now<00:01:35.780> moving<00:01:35.960> over<00:01:36.110> to<00:01:36.230> time-based<00:01:36.740> things

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
now moving over to time-based things

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:38.560 
now moving over to time-based things
that<00:01:37.070> you<00:01:37.160> can<00:01:37.310> do<00:01:37.430> with<00:01:37.610> your<00:01:37.760> iPad<00:01:38.120> zippedy<00:01:38.510> I

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:38.570 
that you can do with your iPad zippedy I

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:40.780 
that you can do with your iPad zippedy I
need<00:01:38.720> a<00:01:38.840> pro<00:01:39.080> you<00:01:39.920> can<00:01:39.950> use<00:01:40.160> all<00:01:40.340> your<00:01:40.370> looping

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:40.790 
need a pro you can use all your looping

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:41.860 
need a pro you can use all your looping
functions<00:01:41.270> so<00:01:41.420> you<00:01:41.480> have<00:01:41.660> your<00:01:41.750> standard

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:41.870 
functions so you have your standard

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:44.080 
functions so you have your standard
looping<00:01:42.550> we'll<00:01:43.550> go<00:01:43.640> back<00:01:43.790> to<00:01:43.910> the<00:01:43.970> beginning

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.090 
looping we'll go back to the beginning

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:49.860 
looping we'll go back to the beginning
of<00:01:44.330> track

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:49.870 

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:55.110 

I<00:01:49.930> can<00:01:50.590> cut<00:01:50.710> that<00:01:50.800> in<00:01:50.860> half<00:01:53.700> you<00:01:54.700> also<00:01:54.880> have

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:55.120 
I can cut that in half you also have

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:56.640 
I can cut that in half you also have
instant<00:01:55.540> looping<00:01:55.780> so<00:01:55.930> if<00:01:56.020> I<00:01:56.110> want<00:01:56.350> I<00:01:56.500> can

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:56.650 
instant looping so if I want I can

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:58.560 
instant looping so if I want I can
change<00:01:56.680> my<00:01:57.100> loop<00:01:57.280> size<00:01:57.520> maybe<00:01:57.880> from<00:01:58.210> a<00:01:58.330> measure

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:58.570 
change my loop size maybe from a measure

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:02.150 
change my loop size maybe from a measure
to<00:01:58.990> the<00:01:59.530> two<00:01:59.680> measures<00:02:00.070> have<00:02:00.370> an<00:02:00.520> auto<00:02:00.670> home

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:02.160 
to the two measures have an auto home

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:09.420 
to the two measures have an auto home
actually<00:02:03.160> two<00:02:03.280> beats<00:02:07.950> well<00:02:08.950> if<00:02:09.040> I<00:02:09.130> want<00:02:09.310> to<00:02:09.369> do

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:09.430 
actually two beats well if I want to do

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:10.830 
actually two beats well if I want to do
a<00:02:09.460> little<00:02:09.700> beat<00:02:09.850> shifting<00:02:10.240> I<00:02:10.360> can<00:02:10.510> go<00:02:10.600> over

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
a little beat shifting I can go over

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:19.290 
a little beat shifting I can go over
here<00:02:10.869> to<00:02:11.050> hold<00:02:11.290> on<00:02:11.410> my<00:02:11.530> shift

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.460 

and<00:02:20.300> there<00:02:20.450> I<00:02:20.480> am<00:02:20.569> applying<00:02:20.870> the<00:02:21.140> beat<00:02:21.260> shift

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
and there I am applying the beat shift

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:24.790 
and there I am applying the beat shift
effect<00:02:22.599> to<00:02:23.599> algorithms<00:02:24.110> DJ<00:02:24.290> application

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:24.800 
effect to algorithms DJ application

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.010 
effect to algorithms DJ application
using<00:02:25.069> a<00:02:25.160> DJ<00:02:25.430> Pro<00:02:25.670> you<00:02:26.360> also<00:02:26.540> have<00:02:26.690> a<00:02:26.780> built-in

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:27.020 
using a DJ Pro you also have a built-in

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:32.449 
using a DJ Pro you also have a built-in
so<00:02:27.200> a<00:02:27.230> few<00:02:27.470> points<00:02:27.830> so
