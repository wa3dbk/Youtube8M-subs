00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.959
 it could just be that you are looking 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.939
 to a new washing machine 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:07.799
 that of course not so nice because that 

00:00:05.939 --> 00:00:09.299
 costs money and probably so far 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:10.650
 so little that you don't know exactly where 

00:00:09.299 --> 00:00:13.320
 you should pay attention 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.059
 I'm going to take you in some backgrounds 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.130
 so you can finally come to the 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.990
 right choice 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.660
 when you orientate on the internet 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:25.440
 or in a store then there is a huge one 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.970
 range of various washing machines 

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:28.200
 and if you look superficially then they are 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.110
 all white 

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:32.160
 it sits in a door and has a button 

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:33.960
 maybe it's good to have a small one 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.420
 look a little deeper into the 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:40.769
 quality ladder but set an example 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:42.600
 in this case pick up the door at the moment 

00:00:40.769 --> 00:00:44.429
 you can see that i open the door 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.339
 that on the inside 

00:00:44.429 --> 00:00:49.829
 very heavy hinge at the moment 

00:00:47.339 --> 00:00:51.210
 that you would move the door back and forth 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.679
 I'd say give it a try at 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:56.159
 different brands then you see that there 

00:00:52.679 --> 00:00:59.420
 huge differences in sitting and this it 

00:00:56.159 --> 00:00:59.420
 opening and closing the door 

00:00:59.999 --> 00:01:05.670
 Do you know they have 60,000 at the factory 

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:07.920
 do it once so that the user is tall 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.910
 enjoy the device and that 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.660
 He doesn't get complaints about it 

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:11.660
 for example the door 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:19.380
 another aspect is also very important 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:20.670
 especially the treatment of the front 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.740
 for example, a very good show 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.350
 for example, with a euro 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.390
 when I get your euro against the front 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:32.100
 nothing happens to it and not softly 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:34.260
 no pretty hard that you do of course 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:37.320
 never practice but it does indicate 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:38.700
 that this device is very robust 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.770
 built 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.600
 i would say he miele there is none 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.800
 better ones 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.560
 what we are going to do when it comes to 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:48.210
 quality i'm gonna take you into it 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.300
 interior of the device 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:54.630
 when the top is decreasing then falls 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:57.810
 directly on a huge piece of stainless steel 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:00.120
 that is the tub that you see right in that 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.770
 cockpit is the drum that you can take from 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:04.020
 of course see here too 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:07.110
 the nice thing is that that whole thing 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:09.509
 hangs on four different feathers and 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.640
 which springs suspended from a frame on 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.890
 it is beautiful 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.840
 Washing machines is actually the side one 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:19.230
 part of the construction 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.950
 with this it is a frame construction and 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:22.560
 that frame 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:25.500
 there the beautiful parts are you 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:28.290
 looks from the outside designed to 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:31.830
 has a very big advantage that frame 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:35.280
 is so stiff that it actually makes you 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:36.450
 so very moderate resonances will get as 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.209
 a device is operating 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:41.190
 you have very little sound with others 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:43.200
 words there is none 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:45.090
 we actually come to steering 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.820
 no consumers who say so 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:49.739
 eye nice say wash 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:52.130
 it is very good to know the way 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:53.880
 every miele is equipped with automatic 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:54.930
 washing programs 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.890
 those are four programs where you 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.340
 just doesn't have to be at all 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:01.680
 think what happens we are one 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:03.780
 number of moles 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:07.230
 shirts but it was also dark 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:09.510
 well a washing machine always has something 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:11.040
 happens now the moment you 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:13.170
 for example, choose the program 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.480
 about and then you as a user 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:17.040
 not think about how much 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:18.630
 water must go in 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.790
 and what temperature should I have that 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:23.730
 wash and what would we turn on 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:24.870
 rhythm are what belongs to the textile and 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:26.640
 for example also how is it with 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:28.680
 centrifuging regularly he does 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:30.570
 all naturally 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:32.430
 you don't have to worry about that anymore 

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:33.840
 to think 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:35.220
 I would almost say a child can do the laundry 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:38.190
 to do 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:40.740
 of course you buy a washing machine so that 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:42.600
 your clothes will only be what you clean 

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:44.790
 not want is that your clothes are excessive 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:46.950
 wear out 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:48.480
 every washing machine family that is 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:50.970
 performed with the so-called 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:52.950
 softcare drum 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:56.010
 this patented drum is constructed 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:58.350
 made of stainless steel and has small 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:00.090
 holes 

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:03.150
 besides those small holes it would also 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:04.860
 much fewer holes and he has one 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:07.590
 very special structure 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:09.420
 a so-called honeycomb structure and 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:11.130
 that ensures that at the moment 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:13.890
 you are washing that there is a water 

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:15.930
 film is created between your clothing and it 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:17.220
 metal and then you just have less 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:18.480
 wear 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:20.489
 so that ultimately your favorite sweater 

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:24.020
 just beautiful for a long time 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:26.160
 some strange actual soap is there for 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:29.130
 to clean textiles and that it is tasty 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:30.390
 is going to smell but out funny is on it 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:31.890
 moment that it falls behind in the 

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:33.240
 detergent drawer 

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:34.800
 then it looks there is no longer as tasty 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:36.810
 and that is what this allows 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:38.850
 not very tasty anymore 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:41.640
 by the way, look a little better 

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:45.840
 to that detergent drawer 

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:47.760
 what you see is that here you do with soap 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:49.830
 in that soap that is taken away by 

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:52.680
 the water and it eventually ends up in the 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:54.900
 fairly leftovers from the sea remain 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:56.970
 behind 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:59.040
 but not with these two all 

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:00.990
 family washing machines that have one 

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:04.169
 special system incorporating this completely 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:06.870
 is thoroughly cleaned and that means 

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:09.919
 that he actually always like that 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:09.919
 continues to see the way it looks now
