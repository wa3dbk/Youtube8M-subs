00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:06.500
 recycling 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.770
 every day the inhabitants of the metropolitan region 

00:00:11.369 --> 00:00:13.059
 we vote or less 

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:15.769
 lucino cervantes uemc 

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:17.240
 this means 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.360
 that all when we are about six million kilos well six thousand 

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:24.480
 tons 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:25.769
 in trucks 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.869
 means that they go through the city every day 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:30.750
 emergence of these vehicles 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.880
 continuation and the central 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:37.440
 currently the household solid waste 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.440
 only 7% resented 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:45.790
 but established 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:49.880
 habitually 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:52.880
 they use the word garbage or waste 

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:55.280
 but all the materials that over dialogue 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.280
 and that apparently nanjing years 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.600
 but nevertheless 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.010
 also it is preferred to talk about waste 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:05.040
 to indicate that these materials 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.440
 they still have value 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:09.440
 and who automatically pending other 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:12.250
 that's how we can find 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:15.250
 medical president and if the industrial 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.960
 we decided domiciliary 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.410
 are those that are generated in homes 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:25.970
 Offices 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:30.520
 local commercial educational establishments and restaurants 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:34.580
 instead 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:36.580
 industrial waste 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:40.550
 you just have to go for any material that comes from a precious industrial 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:43.050
 then who 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:46.450
 this can be liquid I am god palaces 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.440
 level 3 r 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:55.630
 reduce 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:57.360
 re-use 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.360
 Recycle 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:04.150
 reduce has to do with the following 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:06.920
 you have to go shopping if you consume 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.619
 has a direct relationship with what you throw 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:12.139
 that's why it's vitally important 

00:02:12.139 --> 00:02:15.139
 finally consume them and avoid waste 

00:02:18.669 --> 00:02:20.239
 of using 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:23.179
 is to give maximum utility 

00:02:23.179 --> 00:02:25.309
 without destroying them 

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:27.369
 with 66 

00:02:27.369 --> 00:02:28.759
 thus 

00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:31.170
 let's open the energy that would have been destined 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.170
 it can be said product 

00:02:36.779 --> 00:02:38.299
 Recycle 

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:42.489
 is to use the materials again and again to make new products 

00:02:43.089 --> 00:02:46.719
 reducing significantly the utilization that again 

00:02:46.719 --> 00:02:49.719
 cousins 

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:53.329
 but what can we recycle is 

00:02:54.469 --> 00:02:57.469
 leftovers 

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:03.479
 the clown technique 

00:03:06.669 --> 00:03:09.669
 or well 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:14.069
 identical 

00:03:15.809 --> 00:03:18.809
 details 

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:22.189
 so 

00:03:22.189 --> 00:03:24.549
 recycle are produced 

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:27.549
 I adore of laziness 

00:03:29.309 --> 00:03:32.309
 saving of drinking water 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:37.019
 saving raw materials 

00:03:39.059 --> 00:03:42.149
 in the impact of the types systems and their natural resources 

00:03:46.439 --> 00:03:47.619
 time saving 

00:03:47.619 --> 00:03:50.619
 first and then 

00:03:53.249 --> 00:03:56.119
 a person produces on average 

00:03:56.119 --> 00:03:58.369
 Has no sense 

00:03:58.369 --> 00:03:59.859
 separate the waste 

00:03:59.859 --> 00:04:02.249
 will give you each one is having adequate 

00:04:02.249 --> 00:04:05.249
 in full recovery 

00:04:09.189 --> 00:04:12.549
 Jose M 

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:15.310
 that seems more usual concerns to do 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:18.310
 the next month 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:20.900
 but tito zetas 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:22.909
 the yellow containers 

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:25.520
 They are used to deposit containers 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:28.340
 they want metal plastics 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:31.340
 and tetrabrik 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:36.939
 you can also find 

00:04:36.939 --> 00:04:40.120
 green containers 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:42.499
 in which you can have leftovers of food 

00:04:42.499 --> 00:04:43.600
 signals 

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:44.800
 according to sanz 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:46.240
 etc 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:47.469
 that is to say 

00:04:47.469 --> 00:04:50.469
 everything that is organic matter 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:55.240
 Likewise 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:57.460
 we found blue containers 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:59.710
 which are not used to put paper 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:02.210
 newspaper views 

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:05.339
 Carlton packaging 

00:05:05.339 --> 00:05:08.339
 thing that we no longer use iquique we were from the sector 

00:05:11.409 --> 00:05:14.169
 They can also deposit materials 

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:15.469
 jars 

00:05:15.469 --> 00:05:18.469
 wines in light green containers 

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:22.509
 Similarly 

00:05:22.509 --> 00:05:25.549
 wigan for citing other waste in containers of other colors 

00:05:32.699 --> 00:05:35.699
 He passed the step to recycle 

00:05:36.879 --> 00:05:40.249
 first we must start at home separating the waste 

00:05:41.689 --> 00:05:43.189
 in this way 

00:05:43.189 --> 00:05:46.669
 in the metropolitan region in the people who do in separating their trash 

00:05:47.499 --> 00:05:49.559
 Well, in supermarkets 

00:05:49.559 --> 00:05:52.879
 today is nationalizing companies today charitable institutions 

00:05:53.639 --> 00:05:56.129
 have enabled deposits of the entity itself 

00:05:56.129 --> 00:05:58.169
 Kiko papers 

00:05:58.169 --> 00:06:01.389
 sectors of them diaz and metals 

00:06:03.569 --> 00:06:08.520
 On the other hand, the municipality has to invest in advertising 

00:06:09.279 --> 00:06:11.360
 they count on that they must be recycled 

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:15.219
 to remove from the homes the waste separated by the neighbors 

00:06:19.589 --> 00:06:22.709
 that is, what can be done in shelters 

00:06:23.409 --> 00:06:27.610
 which and facilities that will sit national and classify me and the 

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:30.610
 recycling 

00:06:33.939 --> 00:06:35.169
 later 

00:06:35.169 --> 00:06:38.560
 this waste is purchased from the collection centers by companies 

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:39.919
 recyclers 

00:06:39.919 --> 00:06:42.379
 Spain and transform them and raw material 

00:06:42.379 --> 00:06:45.379
 from which the products are made 

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:51.169
 Likewise 

00:06:51.169 --> 00:06:54.550
 the raw material made by recycling companies 

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:56.689
 can be bought by industries 

00:06:56.689 --> 00:06:59.689
 Labor on Thursday 

00:07:05.389 --> 00:07:06.809
 as we see 

00:07:06.809 --> 00:07:10.379
 When recycling, we comply with several objectives that contribute to the care of the 

00:07:10.379 --> 00:07:13.089
 environment 

00:07:13.089 --> 00:07:16.089
 we beat the volume of waste generated 

00:07:20.199 --> 00:07:23.549
 taking advantage of the resources available in terms of fertilizers 

00:07:28.479 --> 00:07:31.479
 we avoid overexploitation of natural resources 

00:07:32.669 --> 00:07:35.619
 and the costs of the final position of the waste are reduced
