00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:16.550
 pm w presents the third generation of 

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:20.300
 x5 the brand has this bird sport 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:21.800
 digital activity for 14 years in 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.870
 your program 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:27.410
 almost all variants come with 

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:29.180
 full drive x drive series in 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:32.449
 this generation is added a version 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:34.640
 diesel with rear-wheel drive a screen 

00:00:32.449 --> 00:00:38.590
 front display offers the 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.590
 driver now new content 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:49.080
 the x5 is a completely new car 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.270
 you notice it already in the front design with a 

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:53.940
 grill much more vertical in the 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:57.150
 inside the instruments are much more 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:59.550
 magnificent legible 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:04.980
 at the beginning three will be available 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:07.890
 engines we tested the x5 30 x drive 16 

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:11.040
 3- liter diesel cylinders with one 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:15.710
 Power of 190 kilowatts torque 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.710
 maximum 560 newtons subway 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:24.260
 acceleration in 69 seconds from 0 to 100 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:27.010
 the new engines also consume less 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.010
 than the previous ones 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:44.430
 in all the models we managed to reduce the 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:47.400
 consumption up to 17% for example in the x 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:49.980
 drive 30 d but we do not either 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:54.300
 remain behind remarkable is especially the 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:57.420
 s drive 25 d that emits only 149 grams 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:02:00.210
 of CO2 per kilometer which is a 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.620
 consumption of only 56 liters per 100 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.400
 kilometer 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:07.280
 as a success the fund is kilometer 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:09.770
 The new design includes a system of 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:13.720
 light with round headlights that goes up 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:13.720
 the typical kidneys on the grill 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:22.830
 strong lines and moldings generate a 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:26.160
 attractive play of lights and shadows in the 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:27.780
 body that makes it look more compact 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:32.270
 of what it really is 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.270
 with its 490 meters long 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:44.579
 The interior design is very harmonious 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:47.249
 doors and the instrument panel are 

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:50.370
 joined by horizontal lines as soon as 

00:02:47.249 --> 00:02:52.889
 a bm w assistance systems offers one 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:55.560
 night vision with recognition of 

00:02:52.889 --> 00:02:57.329
 people and animals in the dark and 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:00.060
 one parking completely 

00:02:57.329 --> 00:03:02.069
 automatic the eye drive button on the 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:04.109
 middle of the console owns a field 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:06.530
 sensor that recognizes the writing of the 

00:03:04.109 --> 00:03:06.530
 driver 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:19.060
 practiced the opening of the gate 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.159
 trunk by remote control the gate 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:24.370
 is divided into two as it is 

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:27.189
 tradition in the back bank x5 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:29.730
 can fold in thirds the trunk 

00:03:27.189 --> 00:03:33.629
 offers a maximum load volume of 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:36.250
 1870 liters 100 more than its predecessor 

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:39.840
 optionally it can also be ordered 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:39.840
 a third row of seats 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.250
 the x5 is designed especially for walking 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:48.170
 on asphalt why now bmw offers 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:50.620
 also a variant only with traction 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:50.620
 rear 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:56.240
 we do not think much we are successful and 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:59.780
 we want to continue being in all the 

00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:02.930
 world there are regions where the 4x4 by the 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:05.660
 climate is not as important and in others 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:08.959
 for the tax on CO2 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:11.450
 I'm a jeep in the 4x4 version 

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:13.630
 go through difficult terrain without major 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:13.630
 problems 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:18.609
 this is the test 

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:26.930
 we left with the x5 out of route the car 

00:04:24.319 --> 00:04:28.879
 of more than two tons of weight wheels 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:31.340
 without major efforts for steep 

00:04:28.879 --> 00:04:33.529
 pending the full attraction 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:36.169
 distribute the force between the four 

00:04:33.529 --> 00:04:38.259
 wheels and ensures good adhesion to 

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:38.259
 ground 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:54.850
 small grooves are also not an obstacle 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:54.850
 any 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:06.790
 and did full contraction or just 

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:08.590
 back the new bmw x5 leaves a good 

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:12.870
 impression despite its large 

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:12.870
 Dimensions is very maneuverable and pack 

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:19.690
 plus an eight- box automatic 

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:22.660
 marches the x5 comes with stop function 

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:25.090
 start what reduces the consumption in 

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:29.590
 As for dynamics, you can choose between 

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:32.440
 various driving modes of the x5 bm w 

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:33.700
 has sold so far 13 million 

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:36.340
 units 

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:40.410
 the new one has all the attributes for 

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:40.410
 continue the success of his predecessor
