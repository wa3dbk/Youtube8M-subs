00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:07.120
 what happens snakes good we are 

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:09.760
 here with atrox is the new champion worth 

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:12.930
 we expected so much already and well 

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:16.230
 He explained a little about the champion 

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:18.780
 we go with the passive when using a flange 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.940
 why it costs health to others stores the 

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:23.790
 auto damage faked in the well 

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:26.220
 bloody when dying back I am my green and 

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:29.100
 draws the blood from the well, reminding 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.080
 for a while recovering during 

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:32.820
 a time then it is that it remains motionless 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.230
 on the site and is recovering that life 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:41.550
 that we have in the well 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:41.550
 through take flight with the dark q 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:46.690
 to grandfather traffic and fell into a 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.670
 specific location doing good then 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:52.510
 A X of damage depends on how 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:54.570
 let's have about the skill points of 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:57.370
 physical year to all champions 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:00.220
 close and knock down targets in the 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:01.480
 impact center for a second 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:03.460
 but that in all the skills that 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:07.870
 go up the q 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:15.430
 does not rise the number of seconds 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:20.270
 of the cost of that study it is to 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:24.119
 principle is 10% of current life 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:27.149
 so then we would be adding 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:31.409
 it is the bloody well that blood already 

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:35.159
 costs the q we go with the w that is the most 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:37.679
 interesting of all 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:41.270
 and it is that we can put it in being of 

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:44.119
 blood or wells price bloody sorry 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:47.090
 s of blood every three attacks to others 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:54.920
 recover then a percentage of 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:59.179
 life is worth good not so much points of 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:02.470
 life is increasing by 200% when 

00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:05.750
 you are below half life 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:08.990
 although this what is a combat 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:10.700
 recover quite a lot of life and then 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:13.640
 we have the bloody price the pc 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:18.370
 bloody every three attacks back ago 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:18.370
 so much damage more damage 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:23.040
 and scale a lot more of the objects that 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:29.189
 let's have and runes 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:32.640
 of physical damage bonus and lose life in 

00:02:29.189 --> 00:02:36.110
 good fast way to fill our 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:38.600
 bloody wells too 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:41.840
 others unleashes the power of his sword and what 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:46.190
 sends forward this is swords of the 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:48.540
 torment now and doing it a 75 120 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:50.670
 it depends 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:55.230
 of the level that we have raised 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:57.239
 stability plus climbing in ap point 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:00.510
 of the magic year to all enemies 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:02.129
 affected and three guarantees a 40 per 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:08.519
 cent on all levels of life 

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:09.959
 during a press a second 75 22 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:11.730
 Well, a few seconds that go to 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:13.280
 climb not depend skill you have 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:16.700
 uploaded 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:19.850
 cost 5% of current life a range 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:24.050
 that is pretty decent in a range of 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:26.600
 900 the q have very few features 650 that 

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:29.569
 they tuna but good if you get it right 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:30.800
 with the in chalk you can do good 

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:34.540
 something 

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:36.310
 the r when activating trucks 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:37.780

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:40.719
 enemy champions around him equal 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:42.790
 at 15% plus a percentage of your 

00:03:40.719 --> 00:03:45.219
 current health status during the 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:47.680
 following 12 seconds increases health 

00:03:45.219 --> 00:03:50.370
 to all 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.370
 plus 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:58.220
 50 65 80 per champion hit the 

00:03:55.099 --> 00:04:01.090
 attack speed increases by 25 a 35 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:01.090
