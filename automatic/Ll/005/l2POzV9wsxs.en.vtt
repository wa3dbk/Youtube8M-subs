00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.450
 do it 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.959
 hi i am andre and this is the sony 

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:11.879
 xperia sr 

00:00:09.959 --> 00:00:16.049
 a waterproof android smartphone that 

00:00:11.879 --> 00:00:18.630
 can also be filmed around the water 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:21.210
 is a headset with attachments and one 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.849
 adapter with a micro-usb cable 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.919
 the xperia zr is made of non-slip 

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:28.470
 rubbery plastic which makes it tasty 

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:30.329
 lies in the hand and certainly as the device 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.790
 a little wet is still a good one 

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:34.320
 grip offers all connections are back 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.540
 can be found behind doors 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.179
 because the device is waterproof in 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.250
 unlike the xperia z it is with 

00:00:39.179 --> 00:00:43.350
 it is possible to put the battery there 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.449
 and we find behind the battery 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.559
 then also the SIM card slot and the micro SD 

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:49.440
 card slot 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:51.059
 compared to the waterproof xperia z 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.359
 we also find one at the move 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:56.999
 camera button with the xperia zr 

00:00:54.359 --> 00:00:59.280
 sony a nice android smartphone off with 

00:00:56.999 --> 00:01:02.460
 good specifications and the possibility 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:05.309
 to take underwater photos and videos 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.890
 the name says it already has the xperia zr 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.590
 many similarities with the xperia z 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.630
 almost everything has remained the same internally 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.790
 the quad core processor of one and a half ich 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.790
 ore is present the 2 gigabytes 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:20.910
 main memory and the 4g support 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:23.820
 the zr does have a slightly smaller 4.55 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:25.500
 inch screen with a hd ready resolution 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.870
 instead of a full hd resolution 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.100
 as with the xperia z 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:31.110
 but the screen will still be 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.690
 use the bravia two technology 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.820
 the internal memory is also something 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:38.400
 shrunk to 8 gigabytes but that is 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.410
 also expandable 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.330
 android 4 point one is unfortunately not the 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:44.520
 very latest version of android 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:46.800
 currently available for the 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.240
 the rest we find a skin of sony die 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.430
 is over the operating system 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.950
 but these adjustments are real 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.710
 at least the different sony 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.940
 multimedia applications 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:58.830
 pre-installed for example the wat 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:01.380
 my application with which you also have a 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:02.820
 can listen to music at the move 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.640
 of course it's all about being 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:08.099
 water resistance up to 1 meter depth and 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.929
 30 minutes long you have to 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:11.400
 always be careful that you all 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.980
 have closed the covers 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.930
 by adding the camera button 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.489
 you can also film under water and 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.200
 to photograph 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:21.349
 there is one for this 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:23.599
 13.1 megapixel camera present that beautiful 

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:25.310
 drop images in worse 

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:27.620
 lighting conditions is also one 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:30.050
 flash that helps, however, you need here 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:32.360
 don't expect too much from it 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:33.379
 the photos and videos that are under water 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.870
 to be made 

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:38.030
 look good and it is definitely with the 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:43.330
 eye on summer vacation and very nice 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:50.209
 for the butter the men from 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:52.790
 the cloud comes from the figurehead 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:55.099
 put there is a logical extension 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:57.860
 the waterproof series of xperia 

00:02:55.099 --> 00:03:00.079
 Phones that Sony has now is also there 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:02.720
 an xperia that lets you take nice photos and 

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:04.280
 can make videos under water 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:06.290
 since the device is mainly above 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:08.030
 water is going to be used, too 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:10.579
 important that the specifications are good 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:12.500
 and this is also with the xperia z er 

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:14.450
 no problem 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.790
 do you also want underwater pictures and 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:18.049
 shoot videos with the xperia zr 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:20.750
 from sony 

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:22.760
