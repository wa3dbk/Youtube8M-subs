grip on this one and I cannot get it off
how<00:02:18.290> hard<00:02:18.530> I<00:02:18.650> try<00:02:18.920> so<00:02:19.760> you<00:02:19.820> may<00:02:20.000> think<00:02:20.030> that

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:25.959 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:03:03.160 

without<00:02:57.760> next<00:02:58.760> thing<00:02:58.910> is<00:02:59.620> on<00:03:01.209> you<00:03:02.209> for<00:03:02.840> about

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:17.540 
is one launch you want to kind of push

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:20.260 
is one launch you want to kind of push
your<00:04:17.720> launcher<00:04:18.260> forward<00:04:18.859> while<00:04:19.609> pulling<00:04:20.120> out

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:20.270 
your launcher forward while pulling out

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:22.820 
the string to the side and leaving it on

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:41.450

an<00:04:22.940> angle

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:41.460 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:05:07.470 

so<00:04:42.460> in<00:04:42.700> battle<00:04:43.150> I<00:04:46.410> will<00:04:47.410> do<00:05:05.640> it<00:05:06.640> does<00:05:06.910> get<00:05:07.210> it<00:05:07.330> to

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:07.480 
so in battle I will do it does get it to

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:13.860 
so in battle I will do it does get it to
move<00:05:09.930> and<00:05:10.930> my<00:05:11.080> last<00:05:11.730> it<00:05:12.730> is<00:05:12.910> reversed<00:05:13.450> inning

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:13.870 
move and my last it is reversed inning

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:18.450 
move and my last it is reversed inning
which<00:05:14.020> is<00:05:14.140> kinda<00:05:14.620> cheesy<00:05:14.980> but<00:05:15.130> if<00:05:16.000> you<00:05:17.250> see<00:05:18.250> try

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:18.460
