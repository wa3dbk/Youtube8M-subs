00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 Hello dear friends video 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:06.299
 it would seem abc third in karelia but 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.940
 no i would like to dedicate this video 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.980
 heavy equipment shooting when 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:14.009
 shoot the strands it's important to remember three 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:17.070
 moment the first moment is where are you 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:19.710
 shoot and when you feel recharge 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:22.439
 the second point is the amount of strength 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.269
 your team directly you on 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:27.630
 specific front area 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:31.080
 the third moment is getting the advantage 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.969
 at the moment when the enemy is wrong 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.570
 precisely at the second when the enemy 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.809
 was wrong 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:39.410
 you must realize your advantage 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.930
 your own plus example opponent broke away 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:44.670
 very hurried left I 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:46.890
 talked about it in his releases about 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:50.579
 the five mistakes of the deadly world of tanks 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:54.020
 and so we go to Karelia love this very much 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:56.699
 map squared a8 i don't ride 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:01:01.620
 directly conversations third a in 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:04.979
 square jay 12 for the reason that 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:07.830
 just v8 drive faster ahead of me 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:10.560
 super persh this super pershing will be us 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.670
 help him sovzvodny juice in the third and 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.100
 accordingly there is a certain 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.320
 confidence that these guys too 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.920
 will come here to wipe and possess 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.659
 good tools and we will be quite 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.439
 worthy support and so attention 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:26.040
 first light 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:29.549
 t21 highlight for us mt-25 lit up 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:33.150
 Us, I see that of 3 enemy IS 3 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:35.430
 seeks court but at the same time a pebble 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:38.430
 I drive up no one with me super 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.180
 Pershing accordingly if I shoot 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.520
 but 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.380
 and the enemy are shooting at us pavel 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.040
 girls are just an advantage of the first 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.520
 the shot 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:49.640
 I shoot he shoots back and super 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.380
 Pershing should now go out and 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:54.030
 destroy this guy on not put 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.040
 him how to be extra damage he is 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.470
 sees well done rides forward truth not 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.540
 very convenient for yourself but there is damage 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:03.450
 makes him thank you for it 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:06.090
 I recharge from 3 recharged I have to 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:09.330
 give him damage I give under the body super 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:12.750
 Pershing recharges faster from 3 and he 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:15.120
 does this lesson cheer now on the very 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:17.040
 Super walking is faster and faster. 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.260
 he is ricocheting, I understand that 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.900
 I will have to finish Isa the third and 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:24.900
 calmly finishes him 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:27.810
 the moment advantage then you have to choose 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:30.540
 who will shoot for yourself out of 2 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.860
 or someone else but pay attention to 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.260
 minimap here we appear 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.489
 additional. and I am very interested 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.530
 who it is despite the fact that I'm in 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:40.620
 sniper aim it below this 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:43.800
 centurion one accordingly we are here 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:46.010
 we shoot eight figure eight 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:48.300
 eight sevens fit 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:50.070
 the enemy could have a shootout 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:52.739
 figure eight figure eight 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:55.440
 another eight who hurried 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:57.420
 and seven that is, the enemy could 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:58.370
 be in this situation on one barrel 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:01.980
 more 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:04.470
 but that did not happen and so centurion y 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:07.380
 he gets the turret remember this 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:09.299
 point and minus centurion minus one more 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:12.360
 eight is a big advantage for us and 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:15.330
 here we already see the red line on 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:17.280
 choose a line of green ones 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:19.560
 extreme and those who are comfortable to shoot 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:22.170
 extremely now for me royal tiger 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.850
 and super pershing he can also 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:26.430
 work fine because that 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:28.860
 her just the barrel goes down 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:30.959
 small exchange of shots i.e. 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:33.360
 take super pershing yourself damage 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:35.280
 the royal tiger shot out I understand 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:38.340
 this will shoot him while I'm not curing 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:40.170
 already charged shoot at royal 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:42.510
 tiger why is this going to put 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:44.549
 slightly rapa because a have 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:46.200
 superpershing more health I already 

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:49.130
 got one shot this with 3 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:52.200
 royal body here is the exchange of HP 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:54.959
 i'm exchanging ear for super pershing understanding 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:59.400
 that he understands my support will go 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:04:02.100
 forward super pershing now fights skt 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:05.190
 need to help him and help does not kill 

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:07.109
 it's trying to target something through the body 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:09.060
 directly superpershing risk 

00:04:07.109 --> 00:04:12.180
 get into the royal tiger or not 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:14.489
 get into it get superpershing we 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:16.709
 should help him destroying trunks 

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:18.359
 who are trying to pick him up super 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:20.519
 Pershing with a royal tiger is quite 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:23.700
 able to duel alone 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:26.370
 so we have him in that position and 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:29.910
 left and killed precisely from the author 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:32.940
 more tactfully those guys who did not have time 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:36.510
 move away we must take years just 1 4 

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:38.850
 go ahead and you know these are not 4 

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:40.410
 I managed to leave for three or four days 

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:42.810
 him come he tried to shoot 

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:44.730
 from afar i'm just trying this t-34 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:46.770
 they understand that 5 is not going anywhere 

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:48.810
 We will go to him calmly falling 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:51.750
 just a little later we'll be in it 

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:54.840
 shoot i choose my target t-34 if 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:57.480
 want here purely statistically who 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:05:00.780
 tends to fill the homework but here's more 

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:03.540
 homework you can fill with t 34 and I 

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:05.550
 I finish square 5 as you understand 

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:08.850
 hulka lives a little bit you punches him 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:10.710
 whom 4 flies forward does not pierce him well 

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:11.850
 Well then, I have time to recharge and 

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:15.280
 get to 

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:18.070
 but all this was decided by friends in fact 

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:21.190
 in three moments in a fight with 

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:24.900
 and the third 2 fight itself is to finish 

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:26.800
 centurion knocked out barrel 3 brawl this 

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:30.520
 royal tiger itself 

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:33.550
 everything else is just chop the meat 

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:35.770
 it is impossible to name another 

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:37.360
 to win this battle we had much 

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:39.790
 no matter what the tanks 

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:43.810
 the enemy is actually in that square 

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:46.690
 there were a superior number of us there were fewer 

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:49.120
 but we responded clearly quickly and 

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:50.919
 in spite of the fact that we were losing hepe 

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:54.820
 look at super pershing just 

00:05:50.919 --> 00:05:57.340
 to your right is 174 hop he has but 

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:59.890
 this guy is just handsome we are with him 

00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:01.990
 acted practically platoon on he 

00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:04.680
 I understood perfectly what I am doing 

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:08.410
 perfectly understood that he would support me 

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:10.810
 shooting and in the end he survived I survived we 

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:13.000
 defeated his Sovzvodnye survived too 

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:14.980
 I hope you managed to do some damage 

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.770
 see what margin they are in 

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:20.020
 Basically a driven with rca in 

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:21.729
 fourth we beat 9000 

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:24.310
 strength data 

00:06:21.729 --> 00:06:27.280
 tanks hope you enjoyed this 

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:29.380
 video again on the mini map look 

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:31.000
 how it all happened before don't forget 

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:33.790
 put like while you watch it 

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:36.370
 we quickly went up 

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:39.550
 saw that came off the third passed 

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:43.360
 he then eliminated one two 

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:45.310
 trunk to in our 4 continued to press 

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:47.620
 in his own way he fired from 

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:49.990
 the enemy who is the fourth therefore 

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:52.360
 and he practically did not participate here 

00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:54.070
 precisely in a massive skirmish of but 

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:56.260
 we controlled from the second 

00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:58.630
 controlled to-t and in the end just 

00:06:56.260 --> 00:07:01.030
 then cut all the remaining meat 

00:06:58.630 --> 00:07:02.650
 I hope you liked this analysis 

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:05.770
