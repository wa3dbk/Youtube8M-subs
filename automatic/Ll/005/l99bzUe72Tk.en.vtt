00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:04.990
 where 

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:13.639
 the fact that we are here in farming 

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:15.799
 your 2015 ticket in the tutorials in this 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:18.320
 occasion the title forgive the tutorial 

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:21.020
 number 9 that corn will last for 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:24.439
 silage and good and here we have what 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:26.060
 we need not so a tipper that 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:29.900
 can be articulated that are the ones that 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:32.509
 they connect to the clock and nothing else 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:35.070
 you can also use the gray medium 

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:38.310
 I do not cord not remember the brand 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.710
 come let's do them astro see and as 

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:41.960
 forever 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.579
 we are going to extend the tube because if not 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.300
 logically we are going to lose everything that 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:48.270
 is being 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.640
 for that I can connect this and we're going to 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.850
 connect this should also be to 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.070
 reverse 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:58.790
 but hey, we're going to give him 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:01.530
 to the X to display the head or 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:05.940
 the comb or whatever you want to call 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:07.380
 then we will light it with the I see the 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:09.190
 we will go down with the ub and we will light it 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.230
 with the time 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:14.090
 to be ready once 

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:17.470
 let's have all this because we already turn on 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:19.330
 you have to give him here 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:22.720
 and come there we are collecting is very 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:24.160
 important to have the tube outside so that 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:27.370
 We will fill the dump truck if 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:28.780
 we got to have everything that 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:30.970
 we are doing now they are lost 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:33.370
 so then let's always try to 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:36.990
 take it like this I tell you because in the 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:36.990
 series already happened to me that I forgot 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.479
 take it out and in the end I lost a whole row 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.990
 of a large field is not worth what 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:47.250
 we can do with this chopped corn 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:50.460
 because you know well that if we use the 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:53.520
 crone is the vision in this case the x 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:55.319
 1100 serves us to apply corn alone 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.990
 and exclusively then, for example, 

00:01:55.319 --> 00:02:00.990
 if we use the new holland or the cage and 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:03.810
 with a special brush as we will collect 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:07.020
 what is being the great only 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:09.319
 for what is going to serve us we are going to 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:12.590
 turn it off 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:15.739
 for what it serves the chopped corn 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:18.370
 can be used to make silage or 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:18.370
 to give hosts 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:25.280
 and this is going, it's worth it, because it can 

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:28.450
 serve as I tell you to make silage 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:30.709
 to make food for cows also to 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:33.740
 make the silage like we're going to see in the 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:36.170
 tutorial to sell it at the plant 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:37.980
 biogas, it would be that it would be 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:40.520
 the one we have there 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:42.680
 so once we have 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:44.769
 and the tipper of 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:47.019
 of what the straw is 

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:49.370
 we'll have to go to one of those silos and 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:51.769
 download once we have 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:54.620
 completed when we see that we already 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:56.480
 We've run out of corn or whatever not 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.950
 we can cover 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:01.519
 I do not have anymore is not saying in fact 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:01.519
 let's stop 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:08.780
 I do not know whether to deny it 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:11.360
 while we go there 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:14.030
 but you have to wait theoretically would have 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:20.110
 what to expect before moving him 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:22.300
 the vehicle is longer 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:24.580
 well we will come to the biogas plant or 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:26.110
 you are using a map like me as 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:29.200
 it can be back for example that already 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:30.850
 It has warehouses to store it 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.890
 you can put there in this case as I say 

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:36.330
 the tutorial then it's about bringing it to 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:36.330
 the biogas plant is worth it is here 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:41.500
 look then download 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:42.909
 as good as you are living now and 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:45.560
 you see that the level of 

00:03:42.909 --> 00:03:47.900
 filled right now is at 1% 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:49.310
 in my series, you can give it to 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:51.250
 back and to front to compact a 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:54.500
 bit 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:58.940
 and up there good in my series as you see 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:04:00.770
 I already had it quite pretty full and 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:03.130
 that then will serve later for 

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:06.260
 Sell ​​it surely the best option 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:08.030
 always if we are going to structure corn is 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:10.400
 to sell it to make the silage here 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:12.440
 and sell it in the biogas plant that 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:14.930
 will give us a lot of money and if in 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:16.370
 Dais bad as good because you know 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:18.480
 that the food of such cows 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:21.600
 can do with grass 

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:24.120
 so then nothing here is this 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:27.710
 tutorial and see you in the next 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:27.710
 video come chao chao
