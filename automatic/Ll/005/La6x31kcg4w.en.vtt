00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.939 

I<00:00:00.179> was<00:00:00.480> just<00:00:00.630> a<00:00:00.719> stationary<00:00:01.350> engine<00:00:01.589> for<00:00:01.860> him

00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:01.949 
I was just a stationary engine for him

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:04.519 
I was just a stationary engine for him
in<00:00:02.040> Australia<00:00:02.520> and<00:00:02.669> let's<00:00:03.629> tell<00:00:03.899> me<00:00:04.020> about<00:00:04.110> how

00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:04.529 
in Australia and let's tell me about how

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:07.490 
in Australia and let's tell me about how
the<00:00:04.589> glow<00:00:04.859> plug<00:00:05.160> melted<00:00:05.670> and<00:00:05.879> how<00:00:06.839> i<00:00:06.870> was<00:00:07.319> using

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.500 
the glow plug melted and how i was using

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.290 
the glow plug melted and how i was using
aerostar<00:00:08.040> to<00:00:08.189> start<00:00:08.460> and<00:00:08.610> apparent<00:00:09.150> that's

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
aerostar to start and apparent that's

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.900 
aerostar to start and apparent that's
really<00:00:09.840> bad<00:00:10.050> like<00:00:10.469> it<00:00:10.679> can<00:00:10.860> diesel<00:00:11.639> knock

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
really bad like it can diesel knock

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:13.820 
really bad like it can diesel knock
really<00:00:12.330> bad<00:00:12.509> on<00:00:12.750> it<00:00:12.870> so<00:00:12.960> that<00:00:13.019> hopefully<00:00:13.440> what

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
really bad on it so that hopefully what

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.460 
really bad on it so that hopefully what
it<00:00:13.920> was<00:00:14.070> but<00:00:14.910> also<00:00:15.120> the<00:00:15.540> seal<00:00:15.900> on<00:00:15.929> that<00:00:16.320> like

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
it was but also the seal on that like

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.279 
it was but also the seal on that like
the<00:00:16.619> seat<00:00:17.210> from<00:00:18.210> where<00:00:18.420> it<00:00:18.539> goes<00:00:18.660> up<00:00:18.869> from<00:00:18.960> here

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
the seat from where it goes up from here

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.859 
the seat from where it goes up from here
to<00:00:19.529> here<00:00:19.740> there's<00:00:20.100> like<00:00:20.220> a<00:00:20.250> seat<00:00:20.580> and<00:00:20.869> that's

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
to here there's like a seat and that's

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.620 
to here there's like a seat and that's
buggered<00:00:22.350> that<00:00:22.680> stuff<00:00:23.039> so<00:00:23.670> because<00:00:24.449> what<00:00:24.600> I

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
buggered that stuff so because what I

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.230 
buggered that stuff so because what I
did<00:00:24.840> is<00:00:24.930> I<00:00:25.050> tightened<00:00:25.470> it<00:00:25.560> in<00:00:25.710> and<00:00:25.949> it<00:00:26.910> should

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
did is I tightened it in and it should

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.990 
did is I tightened it in and it should
seal<00:00:27.599> there<00:00:27.990> but<00:00:28.890> I<00:00:28.920> was<00:00:29.220> getting<00:00:29.369> diesel<00:00:29.880> off

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
seal there but I was getting diesel off

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.150 
seal there but I was getting diesel off
on<00:00:30.179> here<00:00:30.539> which<00:00:31.260> means<00:00:31.439> that<00:00:31.590> that<00:00:31.800> seats

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
on here which means that that seats

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.840 
on here which means that that seats
buggered<00:00:32.579> so<00:00:33.170> a<00:00:34.170> bit<00:00:34.860> of<00:00:34.890> copper<00:00:35.190> might<00:00:35.489> might

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
buggered so a bit of copper might might

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.490 
buggered so a bit of copper might might
actually<00:00:36.090> work<00:00:36.860> or<00:00:37.860> I<00:00:37.920> might<00:00:38.370> have<00:00:38.579> to<00:00:38.610> UM

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:39.500 
actually work or I might have to UM

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:43.340 
actually work or I might have to UM
machine<00:00:40.500> something<00:00:41.040> hopefully<00:00:41.610> not<00:00:42.350> but

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
machine something hopefully not but

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:44.690 
machine something hopefully not but
hopefully<00:00:43.770> a<00:00:43.829> little<00:00:43.950> bit<00:00:44.129> just<00:00:44.520> with<00:00:44.640> a

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
hopefully a little bit just with a

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.639 
hopefully a little bit just with a
copper<00:00:45.059> down<00:00:45.239> there<00:00:45.450> will<00:00:45.629> will<00:00:46.170> seal<00:00:46.440> it<00:00:46.559> up

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
copper down there will will seal it up

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.200 
copper down there will will seal it up
pretty<00:00:46.890> nicely<00:00:47.160> so<00:00:47.610> now<00:00:47.789> what<00:00:47.969> I'm<00:00:48.030> going<00:00:48.149> to

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
pretty nicely so now what I'm going to

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.680 
pretty nicely so now what I'm going to
do<00:00:48.329> is<00:00:49.039> they<00:00:50.039> suggested<00:00:50.610> putting<00:00:50.760> oil<00:00:51.120> into

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
do is they suggested putting oil into

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.709 
do is they suggested putting oil into
the<00:00:51.719> engine<00:00:52.140> like<00:00:52.800> down<00:00:53.070> the<00:00:53.250> intake<00:00:53.610> but<00:00:54.300> the

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
the engine like down the intake but the

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.299 
the engine like down the intake but the
intakes<00:00:55.050> over<00:00:55.350> here<00:00:55.559> so<00:00:55.710> i<00:00:55.739> can't<00:00:55.980> really<00:00:56.039> get

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
intakes over here so i can't really get

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:57.470 
intakes over here so i can't really get
it<00:00:56.430> really<00:00:56.760> in<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:56.969> engine<00:00:57.239> so<00:00:57.390> i'm<00:00:57.449> just

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
it really in the engine so i'm just

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.779 
it really in the engine so i'm just
going<00:00:57.719> to<00:00:57.780> give<00:00:58.590> it<00:00:58.620> a<00:00:58.739> few<00:00:58.770> squirts<00:00:59.280> in<00:00:59.520> here

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
going to give it a few squirts in here

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.910 
going to give it a few squirts in here
tighten<00:01:00.239> the<00:01:00.420> glow<00:01:00.539> plug<00:01:00.780> up<00:01:00.960> and<00:01:01.230> that

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
tighten the glow plug up and that

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.880 
tighten the glow plug up and that
actually<00:01:02.129> increases<00:01:05.990> so<00:01:06.990> i'll<00:01:07.229> do<00:01:07.439> that<00:01:07.650> then

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
actually increases so i'll do that then

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.460 
actually increases so i'll do that then
set<00:01:08.189> the<00:01:08.280> camera<00:01:08.610> filming<00:01:09.030> and<00:01:09.470> hopefully

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
set the camera filming and hopefully

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.109 
set the camera filming and hopefully
that<00:01:10.650> will<00:01:10.799> start<00:01:11.400> it<00:01:11.549> off<00:01:11.640> hopefully<00:01:11.820> there's

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
that will start it off hopefully there's

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.750 
that will start it off hopefully there's
no<00:01:12.240> major<00:01:12.450> damage<00:01:12.720> to<00:01:12.930> the<00:01:13.140> engine<00:01:13.760> that

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
no major damage to the engine that

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.359 
no major damage to the engine that
really<00:01:15.210> pissed<00:01:15.420> me<00:01:15.479> off<00:01:15.799> anyway<00:01:16.799> i'll<00:01:17.130> try

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
really pissed me off anyway i'll try

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.999 
really pissed me off anyway i'll try
that<00:01:17.430> putting<00:01:18.390> oil<00:01:18.659> in<00:01:18.869> the<00:01:19.049> arm<00:01:19.200> intake

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
that putting oil in the arm intake

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.380 
that putting oil in the arm intake
didn't<00:01:20.280> really<00:01:20.490> increase<00:01:20.759> the<00:01:20.880> compression

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
didn't really increase the compression

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:22.969 
didn't really increase the compression
that<00:01:21.509> much<00:01:21.659> so<00:01:21.840> what<00:01:21.960> it<00:01:22.049> is<00:01:22.200> i<00:01:22.350> found<00:01:22.619> a<00:01:22.710> copper

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
that much so what it is i found a copper

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.340 
that much so what it is i found a copper
washer<00:01:23.210> so<00:01:24.210> put<00:01:24.479> a<00:01:24.509> copper<00:01:24.750> washer<00:01:24.960> on<00:01:25.200> there

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
washer so put a copper washer on there

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.310 
washer so put a copper washer on there
it's<00:01:25.439> quite<00:01:25.680> a<00:01:25.710> neat<00:01:25.950> fit<00:01:26.450> so<00:01:27.450> i'll<00:01:27.600> screw<00:01:28.200> that

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
it's quite a neat fit so i'll screw that

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.319 
it's quite a neat fit so i'll screw that
in<00:01:28.560> hopefully<00:01:29.040> that'll<00:01:29.220> seal<00:01:29.729> it<00:01:29.880> up<00:01:29.939> even

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
in hopefully that'll seal it up even

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.200 
in hopefully that'll seal it up even
better<00:01:30.840> than<00:01:30.990> book<00:01:31.340> i've<00:01:32.340> just<00:01:32.640> taking<00:01:32.970> cover

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
better than book i've just taking cover

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.950 
better than book i've just taking cover
that<00:01:34.100> cover<00:01:35.100> off<00:01:35.189> and<00:01:35.340> i<00:01:35.610> can<00:01:35.820> it's<00:01:36.450> lost<00:01:36.750> some

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
that cover off and i can it's lost some

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.170 
that cover off and i can it's lost some
compression<00:01:37.350> somewhere<00:01:38.180> something's

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
compression somewhere something's

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.260 
compression somewhere something's
bugging<00:01:39.630> on<00:01:39.930> it<00:01:40.079> it's<00:01:40.710> myself<00:01:41.009> because<00:01:42.000> I<00:01:42.090> can

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
bugging on it it's myself because I can

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.139 
bugging on it it's myself because I can
sort<00:01:42.479> of<00:01:42.570> just<00:01:42.720> get<00:01:42.960> up<00:01:43.049> his<00:01:43.259> momentum<00:01:43.470> and

00:01:44.139 --> 00:01:44.149 
sort of just get up his momentum and

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:46.580 
sort of just get up his momentum and
that<00:01:45.149> the<00:01:45.270> valves<00:01:45.630> aren't<00:01:45.869> even<00:01:46.170> opening<00:01:46.470> and

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
that the valves aren't even opening and

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.710 
that the valves aren't even opening and
closing<00:01:46.799> should<00:01:47.280> have<00:01:47.549> heaps<00:01:47.939> of<00:01:48.149> compression

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
closing should have heaps of compression

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.770 
closing should have heaps of compression
on<00:01:48.810> both<00:01:49.020> the<00:01:49.250> on<00:01:50.250> both<00:01:50.640> going<00:01:50.939> up<00:01:51.090> and<00:01:51.299> down<00:01:51.390> in

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
on both the on both going up and down in

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.899 
on both the on both going up and down in
the<00:01:51.869> piston<00:01:52.290> and<00:01:52.380> I'm<00:01:52.829> just<00:01:53.040> using<00:01:53.189> one<00:01:53.310> hand<00:01:53.490> I

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
the piston and I'm just using one hand I

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.749 
the piston and I'm just using one hand I
can<00:01:54.090> easily<00:01:54.240> turn<00:01:54.630> over<00:01:55.340> so<00:01:56.340> i'll<00:01:56.460> take<00:01:56.640> the

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
can easily turn over so i'll take the

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.510 
can easily turn over so i'll take the
head<00:01:56.909> off<00:01:56.939> and<00:01:57.180> take<00:01:57.360> cilindro<00:01:58.189> and<00:01:59.189> see<00:01:59.430> if

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
head off and take cilindro and see if

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.130 
head off and take cilindro and see if
one<00:01:59.700> of<00:01:59.759> the<00:01:59.880> Rings<00:02:00.060> is<00:02:00.180> broken

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
one of the Rings is broken

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.250 
one of the Rings is broken
I<00:02:01.729> just<00:02:02.729> took<00:02:02.850> the<00:02:03.030> cylinder<00:02:03.510> off<00:02:03.600> and<00:02:03.810> all<00:02:04.080> the

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:04.260 
I just took the cylinder off and all the

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:05.719 
I just took the cylinder off and all the
Rings<00:02:04.470> are<00:02:04.620> in<00:02:04.680> good<00:02:04.890> condition<00:02:05.070> they're<00:02:05.580> not

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
Rings are in good condition they're not

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.779 
Rings are in good condition they're not
none<00:02:06.510> of<00:02:06.540> the<00:02:06.780> broken<00:02:07.340> piston<00:02:08.340> looks<00:02:08.490> in<00:02:08.640> good

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
none of the broken piston looks in good

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.460 
none of the broken piston looks in good
condition<00:02:08.850> i<00:02:09.270> did<00:02:09.479> notice<00:02:09.690> however<00:02:09.899> there's

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
condition i did notice however there's

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.280 
condition i did notice however there's
like<00:02:10.530> a<00:02:10.649> little<00:02:10.800> Ridge<00:02:11.660> just<00:02:12.660> there's<00:02:13.170> the

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
like a little Ridge just there's the

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:14.630 
like a little Ridge just there's the
first<00:02:13.500> compression<00:02:13.890> right<00:02:14.160> I<00:02:14.250> put<00:02:14.459> them<00:02:14.550> all

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
first compression right I put them all

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.930 
first compression right I put them all
up<00:02:14.959> here's<00:02:15.959> the<00:02:16.110> oil<00:02:16.380> ring<00:02:16.709> just<00:02:17.490> below<00:02:17.910> it

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
up here's the oil ring just below it

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:23.690 
up here's the oil ring just below it
there's<00:02:18.209> like<00:02:18.360> quite<00:02:18.600> a<00:02:18.630> sharp<00:02:21.020> Ridge<00:02:22.459> can<00:02:23.459> get

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
there's like quite a sharp Ridge can get

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:24.830 
there's like quite a sharp Ridge can get
with<00:02:23.820> your<00:02:23.910> fingernail<00:02:24.270> I<00:02:24.390> don't<00:02:24.660> know<00:02:24.780> if

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
with your fingernail I don't know if

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.750 
with your fingernail I don't know if
it's<00:02:24.959> meant<00:02:25.110> to<00:02:25.170> be<00:02:25.260> there<00:02:25.590> on<00:02:25.709> I<00:02:26.280> can't

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
it's meant to be there on I can't

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.300 
it's meant to be there on I can't
remember<00:02:27.230> when<00:02:28.230> I<00:02:28.260> got<00:02:28.500> the<00:02:28.590> Pistons<00:02:28.950> like

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
remember when I got the Pistons like

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.000 
remember when I got the Pistons like
that<00:02:29.520> I<00:02:29.670> know<00:02:29.760> with<00:02:30.150> this<00:02:30.300> one<00:02:30.569> it's<00:02:30.800> it's<00:02:31.800> got

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
that I know with this one it's it's got

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.630 
that I know with this one it's it's got
the<00:02:32.160> like<00:02:33.030> a<00:02:33.060> little<00:02:33.330> angle<00:02:34.489> there's<00:02:35.489> some

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
the like a little angle there's some

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.320 
the like a little angle there's some
sure<00:02:36.209> quite<00:02:36.570> a<00:02:36.600> sharp<00:02:36.959> little<00:02:37.820> close<00:02:38.820> shop<00:02:39.150> the

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
sure quite a sharp little close shop the

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.479 
sure quite a sharp little close shop the
lips<00:02:39.720> out<00:02:39.959> and<00:02:40.530> what<00:02:40.769> that<00:02:40.920> would<00:02:41.280> have<00:02:41.400> been

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
lips out and what that would have been

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:44.660 
lips out and what that would have been
from<00:02:42.380> if<00:02:43.380> I'm<00:02:43.590> pretty<00:02:43.860> sure<00:02:44.070> I<00:02:44.100> must<00:02:44.370> have<00:02:44.550> been

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
from if I'm pretty sure I must have been

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.470 
from if I'm pretty sure I must have been
there<00:02:44.880> because<00:02:45.620> I'm<00:02:46.620> dead<00:02:47.100> I<00:02:47.400> can't<00:02:48.120> think<00:02:48.209> of

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
there because I'm dead I can't think of

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.540 
there because I'm dead I can't think of
any<00:02:48.720> reason<00:02:49.019> why<00:02:49.440> how<00:02:49.800> would<00:02:50.070> get<00:02:50.250> there<00:02:50.430> and

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550 
any reason why how would get there and

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:52.930 
any reason why how would get there and
there's<00:02:50.640> no<00:02:50.820> damage<00:02:51.150> on<00:02:51.480> the<00:02:51.630> cylinder<00:02:52.019> at<00:02:52.290> all

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
there's no damage on the cylinder at all

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.910 
there's no damage on the cylinder at all
like<00:02:53.940> the<00:02:54.180> cylinders<00:02:54.720> in<00:02:54.870> my<00:02:55.380> perfect

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
like the cylinders in my perfect

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.979 
like the cylinders in my perfect
condition<00:02:56.340> like<00:02:56.519> pretty<00:02:57.239> much<00:02:57.300> since<00:02:57.570> I<00:02:57.720> got

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989 
condition like pretty much since I got

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:03.440 
condition like pretty much since I got
it<00:02:58.140> same<00:02:59.989> so<00:03:00.989> I<00:03:01.519> think<00:03:02.519> I'll<00:03:03.000> put<00:03:03.330> it<00:03:03.420> back

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
it same so I think I'll put it back

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.660 
it same so I think I'll put it back
together<00:03:03.870> I<00:03:04.320> don't<00:03:04.500> know<00:03:04.590> what<00:03:04.830> I<00:03:05.040> don't<00:03:05.579> know

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
together I don't know what I don't know

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:07.610 
together I don't know what I don't know
what's<00:03:05.880> happened<00:03:06.269> but<00:03:06.510> I<00:03:07.019> did<00:03:07.049> notice<00:03:07.380> these

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
what's happened but I did notice these

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:12.080 
what's happened but I did notice these
bolts<00:03:08.040> weren't<00:03:08.310> very<00:03:08.489> tight<00:03:10.610> maybe<00:03:11.610> maybe

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
bolts weren't very tight maybe maybe

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:13.479 
bolts weren't very tight maybe maybe
that<00:03:12.299> had<00:03:12.450> something<00:03:12.480> to<00:03:12.780> do<00:03:12.959> with<00:03:13.110> it<00:03:13.260> but

00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:13.489 
that had something to do with it but

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:17.270 
that had something to do with it but
I'll<00:03:14.489> put<00:03:14.880> it<00:03:14.970> back<00:03:15.000> together<00:03:15.299> and<00:03:16.280> tighten

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
I'll put it back together and tighten

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.310 
I'll put it back together and tighten
them<00:03:17.370> all<00:03:17.489> up<00:03:17.670> and<00:03:18.260> see<00:03:19.260> what<00:03:19.380> happens<00:03:19.709> i<00:03:19.829> guess

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:21.320 
them all up and see what happens i guess

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:23.600 
them all up and see what happens i guess
as<00:03:22.320> you<00:03:22.560> all<00:03:22.650> know<00:03:22.680> I've<00:03:22.920> had<00:03:23.040> big<00:03:23.250> problems

used<00:03:40.410> plug<00:03:40.799> it<00:03:40.980> tapers<00:03:41.549> down<00:03:41.579> at<00:03:41.880> the<00:03:42.000> end<00:03:42.320> so

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:43.320 
used plug it tapers down at the end so

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:44.750 
used plug it tapers down at the end so
if<00:03:43.440> we<00:03:43.470> conceive<00:03:43.890> it's<00:03:44.100> like<00:03:44.220> pick<00:03:44.519> her<00:03:44.640> up

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
if we conceive it's like pick her up

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.130 
if we conceive it's like pick her up
here<00:03:44.970> and<00:03:45.090> then<00:03:45.239> threw<00:03:45.540> down<00:03:45.720> there<00:03:45.930> so<00:03:46.079> I'm

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:46.140 
here and then threw down there so I'm

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:47.810 
here and then threw down there so I'm
guessing<00:03:46.350> that's<00:03:46.650> what<00:03:46.860> happens<00:03:47.100> to<00:03:47.190> go<00:03:47.549> folks

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:47.820 
guessing that's what happens to go folks

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:51.140 
guessing that's what happens to go folks
as<00:03:48.000> they<00:03:48.060> wear<00:03:48.720> and<00:03:49.400> I<00:03:50.400> told<00:03:50.640> him<00:03:50.760> no<00:03:50.910> I<00:03:50.940> could

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150 
as they wear and I told him no I could

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:52.430 
as they wear and I told him no I could
make<00:03:51.299> an<00:03:51.450> adapter<00:03:51.900> and<00:03:52.019> he<00:03:52.079> said<00:03:52.320> that's

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:52.440 
make an adapter and he said that's

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:56.530 
make an adapter and he said that's
probably<00:03:53.160> the<00:03:53.340> best<00:03:53.549> idea<00:03:54.440> so<00:03:55.440> I'll<00:03:55.620> have<00:03:55.829> to

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:56.540 
probably the best idea so I'll have to

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:59.870 
probably the best idea so I'll have to
it<00:03:57.540> says<00:03:58.230> 7v<00:03:58.920> on<00:03:59.100> its<00:03:59.280> I'm<00:03:59.430> guessing<00:03:59.760> it's

00:03:59.870 --> 00:03:59.880 
it says 7v on its I'm guessing it's

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:01.880 
it says 7v on its I'm guessing it's
seven<00:04:00.209> volts<00:04:00.420> I<00:04:00.720> put<00:04:00.900> a<00:04:00.930> question<00:04:01.140> on<00:04:01.440> to<00:04:01.680> the

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:01.890 
seven volts I put a question on to the

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:04.580 
seven volts I put a question on to the
Tom's<00:04:02.280> forum<00:04:02.850> that's<00:04:03.090> the<00:04:03.690> old<00:04:03.870> the<00:04:04.440> old

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
Tom's forum that's the old the old

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:07.220 
Tom's forum that's the old the old

machinery magazine forum

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:11.600 
machinery magazine forum
so<00:04:08.129> put<00:04:08.280> a<00:04:08.310> question<00:04:08.489> on<00:04:08.730> there<00:04:10.220> but<00:04:11.220> they<00:04:11.400> all

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:11.610 
so put a question on there but they all

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:13.729 
so put a question on there but they all
seem<00:04:11.640> to<00:04:12.060> think<00:04:12.209> that<00:04:12.330> making<00:04:12.629> a<00:04:12.840> bit<00:04:13.019> and

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:13.739 
seem to think that making a bit and

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:17.319 
seem to think that making a bit and
adapters<00:04:14.430> the<00:04:15.120> best<00:04:15.470> thing<00:04:16.470> to<00:04:16.500> do<00:04:16.799> because

00:04:17.319 --> 00:04:17.329 
adapters the best thing to do because

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:19.990 
adapters the best thing to do because
it's<00:04:18.329> just<00:04:18.389> so<00:04:18.570> old<00:04:18.870> that<00:04:18.959> glow<00:04:19.260> plug<00:04:19.500> so

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:20.000 
it's just so old that glow plug so

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.390 
it's just so old that glow plug so
that's<00:04:21.000> an<00:04:21.150> M<00:04:21.299> 18<00:04:21.720> x<00:04:22.079> 1.5<00:04:22.800> millimeter<00:04:23.040> pitch

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:23.400 
that's an M 18 x 1.5 millimeter pitch

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:28.620 
eight millimeter thread I'll test it on

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:38.280 
tested anyway let me know what it is it

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:40.460 
tested anyway let me know what it is it
it<00:04:38.760> looks<00:04:39.030> coarser<00:04:39.630> than<00:04:39.660> a<00:04:39.810> normal<00:04:40.169> eight

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:40.470 
it looks coarser than a normal eight

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:43.700 
it looks coarser than a normal eight
moment<00:04:40.889> we<00:04:41.070> like<00:04:41.220> at<00:04:41.400> times<00:04:41.900> 1.5<00:04:42.900> volt<00:04:43.410> somehow

dinner<00:04:44.030> but<00:04:45.030> i'll<00:04:45.180> let<00:04:45.330> you<00:04:45.449> know<00:04:45.479> what

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:45.780 
dinner but i'll let you know what

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:47.719 
dinner but i'll let you know what
happens<00:04:45.900> and<00:04:46.350> it<00:04:47.010> looks<00:04:47.190> like<00:04:47.280> i'm<00:04:47.520> going<00:04:47.580> to

00:04:47.719 --> 00:04:47.729 
happens and it looks like i'm going to

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:50.120 
happens and it looks like i'm going to
make<00:04:47.850> an<00:04:47.970> adapter<00:04:48.419> I<00:04:48.720> do<00:04:49.440> actually<00:04:49.710> think

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:50.130 
make an adapter I do actually think

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:51.500 
make an adapter I do actually think
before<00:04:50.460> I<00:04:50.490> went<00:04:50.669> up<00:04:50.789> and<00:04:50.880> got<00:04:50.970> this<00:04:51.150> that<00:04:51.389> what

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:51.510 
before I went up and got this that what

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:53.689 
before I went up and got this that what
i<00:04:51.539> could<00:04:51.630> do<00:04:51.870> is<00:04:51.900> just<00:04:52.229> use<00:04:53.039> this<00:04:53.280> but<00:04:53.550> just

00:04:53.689 --> 00:04:53.699 
i could do is just use this but just

00:04:53.699 --> 00:04:55.340 
i could do is just use this but just
hate<00:04:53.970> the<00:04:54.120> end<00:04:54.240> up<00:04:54.479> until<00:04:54.810> it<00:04:54.900> was<00:04:54.990> like<00:04:55.139> hot

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:55.350 
hate the end up until it was like hot

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:59.120 
hate the end up until it was like hot
and<00:04:55.620> then<00:04:55.770> screw<00:04:56.070> in<00:04:56.330> but<00:04:57.330> a<00:04:57.710> sudden<00:04:58.710> the<00:04:58.889> form

00:04:59.120 --> 00:04:59.130 
and then screw in but a sudden the form

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:00.110 
and then screw in but a sudden the form
and<00:04:59.280> they<00:04:59.340> seem<00:04:59.580> to<00:04:59.610> think<00:04:59.729> that<00:04:59.970> it<00:05:00.090> probably

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:00.120 
and they seem to think that it probably

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:02.420 
and they seem to think that it probably
wouldn't<00:05:00.600> work<00:05:00.660> like<00:05:01.050> i'd<00:05:01.560> used<00:05:01.860> so<00:05:02.070> much<00:05:02.190> gas

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:02.430 
wouldn't work like i'd used so much gas

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:05.240 
wouldn't work like i'd used so much gas
heating<00:05:02.850> it<00:05:02.940> up<00:05:03.030> and<00:05:03.470> fiddling<00:05:04.470> around<00:05:04.620> and<00:05:05.039> by

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:05.250 
heating it up and fiddling around and by

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:06.409 
heating it up and fiddling around and by
the<00:05:05.310> time<00:05:05.430> it<00:05:05.610> gets<00:05:05.760> back<00:05:06.000> in<00:05:06.150> there<00:05:06.300> and<00:05:06.360> I

00:05:06.409 --> 00:05:06.419 
the time it gets back in there and I

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:08.930 
the time it gets back in there and I
cranked<00:05:06.690> it<00:05:06.780> over<00:05:06.870> bro<00:05:07.380> gone<00:05:07.590> cold<00:05:07.940> so

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:08.940 
cranked it over bro gone cold so

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:11.690 
cranked it over bro gone cold so
probably<00:05:09.780> going<00:05:09.930> to<00:05:09.990> test<00:05:10.560> this<00:05:10.710> out<00:05:10.919> with<00:05:11.310> 7

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:11.700 
probably going to test this out with 7

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:16.240 
probably going to test this out with 7
volt<00:05:11.910> battery<00:05:12.300> or<00:05:12.539> six<00:05:12.870> volt<00:05:13.080> battery<00:05:13.919> and

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:16.250 

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:19.580 

making<00:05:17.250> it<00:05:17.340> better<00:05:17.490> so<00:05:18.360> that's<00:05:19.169> what<00:05:19.410> I'm<00:05:19.500> up

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:19.590 
making it better so that's what I'm up

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:23.270 
making it better so that's what I'm up
to<00:05:19.620> now<00:05:20.150> it's<00:05:21.150> close<00:05:21.660> to<00:05:21.690> three<00:05:22.440> three<00:05:23.099> eighths

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:23.280 
to now it's close to three three eighths

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:26.750 
to now it's close to three three eighths
inch<00:05:23.729> bolt<00:05:24.150> or<00:05:25.139> a<00:05:25.169> ten<00:05:25.650> millimeter<00:05:25.860> bolt<00:05:26.310> but

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:26.760 
inch bolt or a ten millimeter bolt but

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:29.980 
inch bolt or a ten millimeter bolt but
the<00:05:27.000> thread<00:05:27.300> pitch<00:05:27.750> is<00:05:28.050> totally<00:05:28.470> different<00:05:28.650> so

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:29.990 
the thread pitch is totally different so

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:32.750 
the thread pitch is totally different so
I'm<00:05:30.990> just<00:05:31.200> putting<00:05:31.830> a<00:05:31.950> question<00:05:32.310> on<00:05:32.370> this<00:05:32.520> is

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:32.760 
I'm just putting a question on this is

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:35.210 
I'm just putting a question on this is
what<00:05:33.150> size<00:05:34.020> thought<00:05:34.229> it<00:05:34.349> would<00:05:34.440> be<00:05:34.560> and

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:35.220 
what size thought it would be and

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:36.370 
what size thought it would be and
hopefully<00:05:35.490> I'll<00:05:35.729> get<00:05:35.820> an<00:05:35.940> answer<00:05:36.180> button

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:36.380 
hopefully I'll get an answer button

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:38.659 
hopefully I'll get an answer button
hopefully<00:05:37.380> I'll<00:05:37.500> be<00:05:37.530> able<00:05:37.710> to<00:05:37.950> make<00:05:38.460> this

00:05:38.659 --> 00:05:38.669 
hopefully I'll be able to make this

00:05:38.669 --> 00:05:41.930 
hopefully I'll be able to make this
adapter<00:05:39.150> I've<00:05:40.080> just<00:05:40.139> got<00:05:40.349> this<00:05:40.610> power<00:05:41.610> box

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:41.940 
adapter I've just got this power box

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:46.129 
adapter I've just got this power box
thing<00:05:42.210> it's<00:05:42.360> at<00:05:42.539> 13<00:05:43.020> bulk<00:05:44.270> is<00:05:45.270> this<00:05:45.570> back<00:05:45.870> for<00:05:46.110> a

00:05:46.129 --> 00:05:46.139 
thing it's at 13 bulk is this back for a

00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:56.999 
thing it's at 13 bulk is this back for a
test

00:05:56.999 --> 00:05:57.009 

00:05:57.009 --> 00:05:59.700 

boo<00:05:57.580> that<00:05:57.819> Scott<00:05:58.089> oh<00:05:58.270> that's<00:05:58.689> good<00:05:59.409> that
