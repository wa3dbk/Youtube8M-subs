not<00:01:19.240> only<00:01:19.540> to<00:01:19.780> play<00:01:19.990> against<00:01:20.260> what<00:01:20.500> you<00:01:20.619> play

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:20.830 
not only to play against what you play

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:24.930 
not only to play against what you play
with<00:01:21.100> you<00:01:22.030> I've<00:01:22.420> got<00:01:22.630> four<00:01:22.930> Harold<00:01:23.940> some

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:24.940

with you I've got four Harold some
people<00:01:25.180> take<00:01:25.300> to<00:01:25.509> someone<00:01:25.869> will<00:01:25.990> take<00:01:26.080> three

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:26.350 
people take to someone will take three

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:27.810 
people take to someone will take three
but<00:01:26.500> I<00:01:26.560> take<00:01:26.740> four<00:01:27.009> and<00:01:27.250> the<00:01:27.310> reason<00:01:27.580> that<00:01:27.610> is

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:27.820 
but I take four and the reason that is

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:30.030 
but I take four and the reason that is
because<00:01:28.210> each<00:01:28.630> Harold<00:01:29.229> is<00:01:29.409> a<00:01:29.440> level<00:01:29.770> three

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:30.040 
because each Harold is a level three

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:31.380 
because each Harold is a level three
side<00:01:30.280> down<00:01:30.490> because<00:01:30.820> they're<00:01:30.970> a<00:01:31.000> level<00:01:31.240> three

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:31.390 
side down because they're a level three

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:33.270 
side down because they're a level three
side<00:01:31.570> because<00:01:31.780> they<00:01:31.840> generate<00:01:32.229> three<00:01:32.800> powers

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:33.280 
side because they generate three powers

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.190 
side because they generate three powers
what<00:01:33.940> I'm<00:01:34.030> looking<00:01:34.360> for<00:01:34.600> is<00:01:34.750> I'm<00:01:34.810> looking<00:01:34.869> for

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
with the grimoire to make sure I've got

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:37.740 
with the grimoire to make sure I've got
a<00:02:35.350> to<00:02:35.560> obtain<00:02:35.950> what<00:02:36.519> makes<00:02:36.760> them<00:02:36.910> uber

a to obtain what makes them uber

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:40.590 
a to obtain what makes them uber
defensive<00:02:38.380> is<00:02:38.620> that<00:02:39.100> if<00:02:39.640> you<00:02:40.060> can<00:02:40.209> get<00:02:40.329> a<00:02:40.360> four

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:40.600 
defensive is that if you can get a four

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:42.660 
defensive is that if you can get a four
controllable<00:02:41.170> and<00:02:41.290> then<00:02:42.040> you<00:02:42.130> cast<00:02:42.459> the

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
controllable and then you cast the

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:44.699 
controllable and then you cast the
grimoire<00:02:43.150> on<00:02:43.390> them<00:02:43.540> which<00:02:43.720> gives<00:02:43.930> us<00:02:44.290> two<00:02:44.560> to

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:44.709 
grimoire on them which gives us two to

that invulnerable say they're now a tool

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:48.630 
that invulnerable say they're now a tool
but<00:02:46.989> I'm<00:02:47.230> asking<00:02:47.470> without<00:02:47.739> so<00:02:48.340> because

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
but I'm asking without so because

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.660 
but I'm asking without so because
there's<00:02:48.850> each<00:02:49.090> you<00:02:49.750> then<00:02:50.049> get<00:02:50.400> they<00:02:51.400> get<00:02:51.549> to

there's each you then get they get to

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:54.090 
there's each you then get they get to
reroll<00:02:52.090> one<00:02:52.360> so<00:02:52.630> you've<00:02:52.780> got<00:02:52.810> a<00:02:52.989> tour<00:02:53.350> re

go<00:04:01.940> for<00:04:02.090> you'll<00:04:02.870> use<00:04:03.050> prescient<00:04:03.470> and<00:04:03.709> you'll

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:03.860 
go for you'll use prescient and you'll

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:05.530 
go for you'll use prescient and you'll

combine that with flickering fire and

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:08.320 
combine that with flickering fire and
flickering<00:04:06.260> fire<00:04:06.560> is<00:04:06.800> 2d6<00:04:07.280> normally<00:04:08.060> strength

five but because I've got the low key of
conjuration<00:04:10.880> strength<00:04:11.510> sixth<00:04:11.870> at<00:04:12.019> range<00:04:12.440> and

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:16.340 
most of the time I'm rolling 3d6 so I'm

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:18.580 
most of the time I'm rolling 3d6 so I'm
on<00:04:16.640> average<00:04:17.329> I'm<00:04:17.690> getting<00:04:17.870> somewhere<00:04:18.350> in<00:04:18.500> the

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:18.590 
on average I'm getting somewhere in the

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:32.630 
dice to go on top of that on average you

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:34.870 
dice to go on top of that on average you
you're<00:04:32.960> running<00:04:33.200> about<00:04:33.410> forty<00:04:33.979> two<00:04:34.160> guys<00:04:34.430> that

you're running about forty two guys that
are<00:04:35.000> fresh<00:04:35.210> inst<00:04:35.510> acts<00:04:35.690> 26<00:04:36.350> that's<00:04:36.680> why<00:04:37.180> you

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:38.180 
are fresh inst acts 26 that's why you

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:39.790 
are fresh inst acts 26 that's why you
can<00:04:38.390> kill<00:04:38.570> things<00:04:38.840> like<00:04:39.050> you<00:04:39.229> know<00:04:39.320> five<00:04:39.560> term

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:39.800 
can kill things like you know five term

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:41.440 
can kill things like you know five term
there's<00:04:40.040> easy<00:04:40.370> five<00:04:40.760> terminators<00:04:41.300> with<00:04:41.419> a

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:41.450 
there's easy five terminators with a

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:43.570 
there's easy five terminators with a
character<00:04:41.780> very<00:04:42.080> very<00:04:42.260> easy<00:04:42.560> so<00:04:43.280> there's<00:04:43.520> a

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:43.580 
character very very easy so there's a

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:45.790 
character very very easy so there's a
mix<00:04:43.760> of<00:04:43.880> defense<00:04:44.240> and<00:04:44.540> attack<00:04:45.140> so<00:04:45.530> you're<00:04:45.650> good

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:45.800 
mix of defense and attack so you're good

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:47.230 
mix of defense and attack so you're good
at<00:04:45.890> shooting<00:04:46.310> and<00:04:46.490> then<00:04:46.640> obviously<00:04:46.760> if<00:04:46.970> you<00:04:47.090> go

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:47.240 
at shooting and then obviously if you go

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:49.270 
at shooting and then obviously if you go
