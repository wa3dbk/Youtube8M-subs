00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.430
 and with a thick portion of si turned on our subject should 

00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:05.720
 then it is medical 

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:10.279
 1 that is very treatable with natural remedies it is about 

00:00:10.279 --> 00:00:13.959
 Macula the generation so around the eye at the point 

00:00:14.899 --> 00:00:16.420
 my guest today 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:18.740
 He also brought a patient all this 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:20.060
 but from his point of view 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:24.660
 At the point he puts on and applies natural remedies and can 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:25.230
 had with 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.060
 quite a big success achieved already we had ever been on the program 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:30.150
 then first book 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.510
 It's called Hailey's eyes Mr SCA wrote quite far 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.760
 and that will be on the market soon 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.760
 Macular degeneration as I said for all who take this topic once 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.230
 Pollen and must because they may belong to the three million in 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:43.970
 Germany 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:44.829
 the one about it 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:47.750
 Andreas Nieswandt is happy to introduce you 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:51.400
 from North Rhine-Westphalia from DÃ¼sseldorf also warned a half-hearted beautiful 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.010
 that they are there phones 20 nice that they are back 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:55.149
 the one in the broadcast 

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:58.149
 he has exactly and he has brought a patient they are 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:02.400
 a dozen from the Elfer Theater Khaki Damian 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.190
 Munich also works there as a choreographer 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:06.160
 holiday destination 

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:09.280
 welcome that you are there that you have the long way to go 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.850
 but without a car or without a car but they could be back in the car 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:13.289
 drive 

00:01:13.289 --> 00:01:16.289
 I could have this man in the Gulf again 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:18.400
 when it was worst 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.400
 in one eye I believe terminations still 36 percent 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:23.159
 eyesight 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:24.800
 went nominal 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.700
 it was only 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.310
 5 so i still got it right then under 30 than it did ok 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:32.850
 under 30 followers 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.930
 very little that one 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:35.780
 almost blind 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:36.670
 century 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:37.860
 that she no longer works 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.580
 It was really difficult to do something new in my job with him 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:44.580
 very difficult because it is possible 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:47.140
 about scenes Böhm 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:48.530
 and 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:50.590
 why "It was my turn 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:52.640
 pretty much, though 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.440
 So on the left is only her first high-strength because gives way to random in 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:59.020
 Dusseldorf engaged in the theater here 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:00.710
 at the Schauspielhaus 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:04.860
 and then it happened there too Wesel overnight I dive afterwards 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.909
 Conti and can never recognize 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:11.209
 pretty awful inconsistent Andreas Wank above and then the extract 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:14.259
 Well, he is lucky enough to take it 

00:02:14.259 --> 00:02:15.979
 Ophthalmologist should be the 

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:17.699
 like the diagnosis 

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:20.869
 and then I went to a specialist in Düsseldorf 

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:24.729
 He then told me you did 

00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:28.069
 there you can do nothing you should already enter moments very sensitive 

00:02:30.909 --> 00:02:34.760
 if not to Andreas among several only concrete I do not wader 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:35.719
 names 

00:02:35.719 --> 00:02:39.729
 Sky is not easy to achieve, but it can be terribly awful 

00:02:39.729 --> 00:02:43.749
 then it will be enough to say then say yes there you are up there 

00:02:43.749 --> 00:02:46.749
 introduced for years is read 

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:50.889
 maybe because of real choice 

00:02:50.889 --> 00:02:54.009
 helpless and desperate and 

00:02:54.009 --> 00:02:57.719
 yes, yes, not helped, they are alone in a dato not recommend 

00:02:57.719 --> 00:03:01.749
 would necessarily make other hacker stuff for example by complex 

00:03:01.749 --> 00:03:03.450
 homeopathic preparations 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:08.970
 Center of the game Conti can be very powerful which can help the height 2 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.359
 but these also reduce protein 

00:03:11.359 --> 00:03:13.229
 had in connection with acupuncture 

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:16.999
 because acupuncture improves her circulation so that overall 

00:03:16.999 --> 00:03:18.699
 Area is better served 

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:22.059
 that looks like part acupuncture certain substances 

00:03:22.059 --> 00:03:25.409
 stimulating them to dilate blood vessels better for Alberti's blood circulation 

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:29.760
 and then finally, the patient can be better in many cases 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.760
 sometimes better to see one out of three to five days 

00:03:33.339 --> 00:03:36.469
 Percent if the patient still has the medication while the right one 

00:03:36.469 --> 00:03:40.069
 Medication the naturalistic preparations then can be parallel 

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:42.999
 There Roosen dismantle the address 

00:03:42.999 --> 00:03:46.829
 That's what most patients in the naturalist do when they get to 

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:50.319
 I come to the quasi drugs so the subgroups tour 

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:52.849
 some of that was fun hardliner 

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:56.069
 they are also so far that they say then I also do the diet and 

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:59.069
 deprives the body of animal protein and acids 

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:03.150
 That's when I saw that, for example, four times last year alone 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:08.009
 Patients complete healing has come in the wake of homeopathy and now 

00:04:08.009 --> 00:04:09.520
 celebrated the topping-out ceremony 

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:13.359
 there were people avant owner of antje patient doing the drusen way 

00:04:13.359 --> 00:04:15.749
 just way the signs of the disease are cover 

00:04:15.749 --> 00:04:17.979
 doctors need to confirm this 

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:21.530
 and but that is a real missrate that one experiences per se 

00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:23.539
 because sets are certainly with thought 

00:04:23.539 --> 00:04:27.059
 i just try it because it gives you no other at the break no 

00:04:27.059 --> 00:04:28.279
 alternative 

00:04:28.279 --> 00:04:31.769
 and during the rental period that they have noticed that works 

00:04:34.599 --> 00:04:37.940
 It was really fast going interest to take my hand week 

00:04:37.939 --> 00:04:41.090
 Master treatment five days and I have it on 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:44.499
 because I noticed on the third day that it gets better 

00:04:44.499 --> 00:04:48.619
 that was so great not change the taz greens and wait for the process 

00:04:49.659 --> 00:04:51.830
 and I do not experience e10 either 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:54.830
 at Andreas in practice 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:59.690
 The patients who dare say that days most are afraid 

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:01.699
 the moment you say it 

00:05:01.699 --> 00:05:05.169
 but that is then bird that she is the stress test 

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:06.759
 because that's the way it is 

00:05:06.759 --> 00:05:10.669
 and what does Servus say to the community of Lohra Fiat? 

00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:13.479
 their natural remedies in the morning for example 

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:14.889
 Jan Siegel 

00:05:14.889 --> 00:05:16.969
 formerly if et al the bands was 

00:05:16.969 --> 00:05:20.699
 These are just two examples of many that have helped 

00:05:20.699 --> 00:05:21.520
 could 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:22.559
 I was singing 

00:05:22.559 --> 00:05:26.229
 yes I can read that I can not stand this on the bottle 5 

00:05:26.229 --> 00:05:30.379
 Per cent the Crysis 2 o'clock me is driving me around him over many 

00:05:30.379 --> 00:05:34.639
 scientifically proven in studies about it also in Munich been made 

00:05:34.639 --> 00:05:35.060
 are 

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:39.499
 the special on contours the blood flow of the senate from the west 

00:05:39.499 --> 00:05:43.349
 and that means every person hears he finds the weighty also good watch 

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:47.999
 he can theoretically better see the disease 

00:05:47.999 --> 00:05:51.479
 NAB alone through acupuncture in conjunction with the best of course with 

00:05:51.479 --> 00:05:53.599
 other natural history specimens 

00:05:53.599 --> 00:05:55.530
 but overall it is around 

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:58.340
 very systematic team does what it wants 

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:02.439
 no wonder usually to report a computer chip in the forehead area 

00:06:02.439 --> 00:06:06.009
 here at the nasal root, therefore, finished eyebrows 

00:06:06.009 --> 00:06:10.139
 Up here overtime there are whole series of similar ups and downs going on 

00:06:10.139 --> 00:06:11.760
 stand left and right 

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:13.710
 or go through the eyebrows 

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:17.580
 so that's some way to over a hundred points an hour right 

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:19.520
 speak if you know it 

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:23.189
 that's one of three spoken here that's what's there 

00:06:23.189 --> 00:06:27.080
 who are here around different areas the water birth different acupuncture 

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:28.630
 System of the world are known 

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:32.940
 two games TuS Schönau area for augurs that has the Japanese style 

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:34.610
 Striker Motors Precht 

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:39.129
 then there are points here that are used by Indian girls medicine 

00:06:39.129 --> 00:06:42.150
 I have to bring time with me or me 

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:43.960
 Colleagues "all-clear" given more 

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:46.819
 the patient comes to me comes about 

00:06:46.819 --> 00:06:49.819
 five days at a time theater one hour a day 

00:06:50.389 --> 00:06:54.930
 Currently, it usually would have to be through the patient's five acupuncture 

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:58.820
 made two oxygen treatment twice a day I mix different 

00:06:58.819 --> 00:07:02.610
 Preparations with quite a lot of preparations the patient takes 

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:05.990
 for leadership talks and make event or percent wishes it 

00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:08.039
 born of different exercises eyes 

00:07:08.039 --> 00:07:12.240
 finally therapy time Homberger percent Esso also wishes 

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:15.190
 It would have led to a great many reconnaissance conversations 

00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:17.339
 the tightness of the diet 

00:07:17.339 --> 00:07:21.619
 Percent but also Werber ten questions on the topic of how should I now 

00:07:21.619 --> 00:07:22.469
 mean 

00:07:22.469 --> 00:07:26.099
 Mats also argue or know they still resin therapy 

00:07:26.099 --> 00:07:29.770
 supports can also be given since the North Hesse passed 

00:07:29.769 --> 00:07:31.719
 Given behavioral rules 

00:07:31.719 --> 00:07:35.789
 In principle, therefore, the patient is 3 iVm claims storm on 

00:07:35.789 --> 00:07:40.159
 Piece in practice because so much to do that both diseases are new to him 

00:07:40.159 --> 00:07:41.990
 Book by Andreas Nieswandt 

00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:43.300
 take the camera 

00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:46.689
 the macular degeneration all about this topic in his new book that 

00:07:46.689 --> 00:07:50.379
 Book before that, parts of the food are also an interesting work for all those 

00:07:50.379 --> 00:07:50.939
 this 

00:07:50.939 --> 00:07:54.059
 Illness I would like to briefly introduce the internet page 

00:07:54.059 --> 00:07:58.550
 As we practice the points - Apis Nieswandt the beast in the end as they do 

00:07:58.549 --> 00:08:02.359
 can look around practice - this found points de there you can contact 

00:08:02.359 --> 00:08:05.099
 so take Andreas Nieswandt because they want otherwise there's of course 

00:08:05.099 --> 00:08:07.809
 also via our website 

00:08:07.809 --> 00:08:09.059
 Bayern does not win thanks 

00:08:09.059 --> 00:08:11.849
 I want spectators and thank you very much for your interest
