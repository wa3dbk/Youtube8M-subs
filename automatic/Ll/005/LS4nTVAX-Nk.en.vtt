00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
I guess I'm going to continue on with my

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:12.919 
I guess I'm going to continue on with my
questing<00:00:10.830> it<00:00:11.639> feels<00:00:11.820> like<00:00:12.090> I'm<00:00:12.300> pretty<00:00:12.630> strong

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
questing it feels like I'm pretty strong

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:15.770 
questing it feels like I'm pretty strong
now<00:00:13.170> I'm<00:00:13.559> going<00:00:14.370> to<00:00:14.549> burn<00:00:14.759> through<00:00:14.969> this<00:00:15.179> quest

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
now I'm going to burn through this quest

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.040 
now I'm going to burn through this quest
line<00:00:16.020> this<00:00:16.680> is<00:00:16.740> the<00:00:16.949> jagged<00:00:17.640> crown<00:00:18.029> and<00:00:18.510> I<00:00:18.869> am

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
line this is the jagged crown and I am

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:39.080 
line this is the jagged crown and I am
in<00:00:19.320> core<00:00:19.619> vinge<00:00:19.859> and<00:00:20.189> temple<00:00:38.090> alright

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
in core vinge and temple alright

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:45.520 
in core vinge and temple alright
continuing<00:00:39.870> on<00:00:42.950> guess<00:00:43.950> that's<00:00:44.129> not<00:00:44.280> a<00:00:44.340> doorway

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:45.530 
continuing on guess that's not a doorway

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:47.900 
continuing on guess that's not a doorway
and<00:00:46.530> I<00:00:46.590> think<00:00:46.800> that's<00:00:46.980> the<00:00:47.160> exit<00:00:47.579> I<00:00:47.700> actually

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
and I think that's the exit I actually

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.529 
and I think that's the exit I actually
ran<00:00:48.480> through<00:00:48.719> this<00:00:48.899> quest<00:00:49.590> with<00:00:50.520> my<00:00:50.789> mage<00:00:51.030> the

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
ran through this quest with my mage the

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.420 
ran through this quest with my mage the
first<00:00:51.780> time<00:00:51.960> when<00:00:52.410> I<00:00:52.440> first<00:00:52.710> recreated<00:00:53.190> my

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:53.880 
it's probably since I started the game
which<00:02:52.240> was<00:02:52.390> like<00:02:52.600> a<00:02:52.630> hundred<00:02:52.780> hours<00:02:52.990> ago<00:02:53.440> so

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890 
which was like a hundred hours ago so

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:56.940 
which was like a hundred hours ago so
it's<00:02:54.819> pretty<00:02:55.000> ridiculous

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
it's pretty ridiculous

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:59.760 
it's pretty ridiculous
what<00:02:57.790> are<00:02:57.940> these<00:02:58.090> these<00:02:58.750> Imperials<00:02:59.350> they<00:02:59.560> just

00:02:59.760 --> 00:02:59.770 
what are these these Imperials they just

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:02.570 
what are these these Imperials they just
spawned<00:03:00.070> right<00:03:00.190> there<00:03:00.550> it's<00:03:01.510> pretty<00:03:01.810> crazy

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
spawned right there it's pretty crazy

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:07.050 
spawned right there it's pretty crazy
let's<00:03:03.580> see<00:03:03.850> I<00:03:04.090> have<00:03:04.120> a<00:03:04.270> knee<00:03:04.450> claw<00:03:05.400> and<00:03:06.400> if<00:03:06.910> I'm

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
let's see I have a knee claw and if I'm

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:12.660 
let's see I have a knee claw and if I'm
not<00:03:07.209> mistaken<00:03:07.780> the<00:03:10.890> how<00:03:11.890> do<00:03:11.950> you<00:03:12.100> look<00:03:12.370> at<00:03:12.520> it

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:12.670 
not mistaken the how do you look at it

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:24.510 
not mistaken the how do you look at it
there<00:03:12.910> we<00:03:13.030> go<00:03:13.150> that's<00:03:13.660> fox<00:03:14.140> moth<00:03:14.530> and<00:03:14.860> dragon

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:24.520 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:26.910 

all<00:03:25.000> righty<00:03:25.780> I<00:03:25.900> hope<00:03:26.200> I'm<00:03:26.380> not<00:03:26.530> missing

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:26.920 
all righty I hope I'm not missing

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:28.860 
all righty I hope I'm not missing
anything<00:03:27.010> I<00:03:27.340> know<00:03:27.490> there's<00:03:27.730> two<00:03:27.910> claws<00:03:28.180> so

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
anything I know there's two claws so

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:31.260 
anything I know there's two claws so
there<00:03:29.050> might<00:03:29.530> be<00:03:29.560> another<00:03:30.370> one<00:03:30.580> somewhere

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:31.270 
there might be another one somewhere

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:34.290 
there might be another one somewhere
else<00:03:32.340> hopefully<00:03:33.340> I<00:03:33.550> won't<00:03:33.730> need<00:03:33.880> to<00:03:34.030> backtrack

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:34.300 
else hopefully I won't need to backtrack

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:47.260 
else hopefully I won't need to backtrack
I<00:03:37.440> don't<00:03:38.440> think

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:47.270 

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:50.120 

okay<00:03:48.270> I<00:03:48.300> think<00:03:48.720> I<00:03:48.810> remember<00:03:48.870> this<00:03:49.350> location<00:03:50.040> oh

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:50.130 
okay I think I remember this location oh

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:53.450 
okay I think I remember this location oh
I<00:03:50.220> even<00:03:50.610> made<00:03:50.850> a<00:03:50.880> video<00:03:51.120> on<00:03:51.570> this<00:03:52.340> where<00:03:53.340> the

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:53.460 
I even made a video on this where the

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:56.300 
I even made a video on this where the
hidden<00:03:53.640> lever<00:03:54.030> is<00:03:54.350> so<00:03:55.350> that's<00:03:55.680> gonna<00:03:55.950> be<00:03:56.160> up

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
hidden lever is so that's gonna be up

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:00.620 
hidden lever is so that's gonna be up
here<00:03:56.340> I<00:03:57.650> know<00:03:58.650> that<00:03:58.680> this<00:03:59.310> is<00:03:59.580> a<00:03:59.790> pressure

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:00.630 
here I know that this is a pressure

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:04.070 
here I know that this is a pressure
plate<00:04:00.840> if<00:04:01.260> you<00:04:01.410> take<00:04:01.650> the<00:04:01.800> dagger<00:04:02.070> off<00:04:03.080> there

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:04.080 
plate if you take the dagger off there

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:09.950 
plate if you take the dagger off there
you<00:04:04.140> go<00:04:06.650> just<00:04:07.650> slip<00:04:07.950> the<00:04:08.070> dagger<00:04:08.430> down<00:04:08.960> and

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:09.960 
you go just slip the dagger down and

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:12.200 
you go just slip the dagger down and
actually<00:04:10.320> before<00:04:10.710> I<00:04:11.010> pull<00:04:11.490> over<00:04:11.760> because

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:12.210 
actually before I pull over because

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:14.840 
actually before I pull over because
joggers<00:04:12.750> will<00:04:12.930> come<00:04:13.080> out<00:04:13.230> I'll<00:04:13.860> probably<00:04:14.190> once
