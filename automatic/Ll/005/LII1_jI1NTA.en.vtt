and you have to have it a manual you
can't<00:00:54.300> do<00:00:54.539> this<00:00:54.660> in<00:00:54.809> automatic<00:00:55.289> I<00:00:55.469> mean<00:00:55.710> you

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
can't do this in automatic I mean you

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.310 
can't do this in automatic I mean you
can<00:00:56.010> but<00:00:56.370> it'll<00:00:56.579> look<00:00:56.699> really<00:00:57.090> bad<00:00:57.390> you'll

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
can but it'll look really bad you'll

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.680 
can but it'll look really bad you'll
lose<00:00:58.559> speed<00:00:58.949> extremely<00:00:59.609> fast<00:00:59.910> and<00:01:00.270> all<00:01:00.449> that

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
lose speed extremely fast and all that

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:06.679 
lose speed extremely fast and all that
and<00:01:01.489> so<00:01:03.559> you<00:01:04.559> get<00:01:04.769> it<00:01:04.920> going<00:01:05.250> you're<00:01:05.640> at<00:01:05.790> 120

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
and so you get it going you're at 120

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.570 
and so you get it going you're at 120
whatever<00:01:06.990> something<00:01:07.350> like<00:01:07.439> that<00:01:07.680> and<00:01:08.070> you

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
whatever something like that and you

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.660 
whatever something like that and you
shift<00:01:08.909> all<00:01:09.119> the<00:01:09.150> way<00:01:09.330> down<00:01:09.540> into<00:01:09.750> first<00:01:10.200> and

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:10.670 
shift all the way down into first and

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.460 
shift all the way down into first and
then<00:01:11.670> you<00:01:12.000> turn<00:01:12.360> you<00:01:12.689> hit<00:01:12.810> down<00:01:12.960> the<00:01:13.170> ebrake

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
then you turn you hit down the ebrake

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.760 
then you turn you hit down the ebrake
and<00:01:13.680> you<00:01:13.740> turn<00:01:13.979> one<00:01:14.310> way<00:01:14.340> so<00:01:14.909> I'm<00:01:15.030> choosing

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:15.770 
and you turn one way so I'm choosing

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:19.730 
and you turn one way so I'm choosing
towards<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:16.890> right<00:01:17.130> and<00:01:17.540> then<00:01:18.560> once<00:01:19.560> you're

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
towards the right and then once you're

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.969 
towards the right and then once you're
at<00:01:19.890> a<00:01:19.920> 180<00:01:20.600> you<00:01:21.600> keep<00:01:22.140> your<00:01:22.320> finger<00:01:22.650> on<00:01:22.680> the<00:01:22.830> E

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
at a 180 you keep your finger on the E

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.370 
at a 180 you keep your finger on the E
break<00:01:23.130> you<00:01:23.580> release<00:01:23.970> off<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.570> acceleration

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
break you release off the acceleration

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.230 
break you release off the acceleration
you<00:01:26.189> turn<00:01:26.549> one<00:01:26.909> way<00:01:26.939> or<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:27.689> opposite<00:01:28.320> way<00:01:28.470> of

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.240 
you turn one way or the opposite way of

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.359 
you turn one way or the opposite way of
where<00:01:30.240> you<00:01:30.420> were<00:01:30.540> just<00:01:30.840> turning<00:01:31.049> and<00:01:31.290> you<00:01:32.159> hit

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
where you were just turning and you hit

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.780

down<00:01:32.549> on<00:01:32.579> the<00:01:33.380> brake<00:01:34.380> which<00:01:35.100> goes<00:01:35.369> to<00:01:35.640> the

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
down on the brake which goes to the

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.160 
down on the brake which goes to the
reverse<00:01:36.329> and<00:01:37.220> your<00:01:38.220> car<00:01:38.520> will<00:01:38.630> flip<00:01:39.630> back<00:01:40.140> over

there's the tracks that you have to be
in<00:03:12.110> 5th<00:03:12.350> gear<00:03:14.799> for<00:03:15.799> whenever<00:03:16.220> you<00:03:16.400> want<00:03:16.489> to

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:16.700 
in 5th gear for whenever you want to

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:18.490 
in 5th gear for whenever you want to
start<00:03:16.940> and<00:03:17.239> then<00:03:17.330> you<00:03:17.450> shift<00:03:17.690> down<00:03:17.900> or<00:03:18.200> this

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500 
start and then you shift down or this

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:19.809 
start and then you shift down or this
tracks<00:03:18.860> where<00:03:19.040> you<00:03:19.130> want<00:03:19.310> to<00:03:19.370> go<00:03:19.459> at<00:03:19.580> a<00:03:19.640> lower

00:03:19.809 --> 00:03:19.819 
tracks where you want to go at a lower

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:22.330 
tracks where you want to go at a lower
gear<00:03:20.180> and<00:03:20.390> being<00:03:20.900> fourth<00:03:21.170> and<00:03:21.410> there's<00:03:22.220> also

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:22.340 
gear and being fourth and there's also

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:26.800 
gear and being fourth and there's also
the<00:03:22.489> different<00:03:23.000> gears<00:03:23.269> for<00:03:23.420> cars<00:03:23.660> but<00:03:25.810> anyway

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:26.810 
the different gears for cars but anyway

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:29.110 
the different gears for cars but anyway
so<00:03:26.870> you<00:03:27.140> want<00:03:27.440> to<00:03:27.560> shift<00:03:27.830> down<00:03:27.950> once<00:03:28.670> you<00:03:28.880> get

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.120 
so you want to shift down once you get

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:33.250 
so you want to shift down once you get
to<00:03:29.360> the<00:03:30.160> drift<00:03:31.160> entrance<00:03:31.670> so<00:03:32.660> you<00:03:32.720> go<00:03:32.900> boom

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:33.260 
to the drift entrance so you go boom

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.949 
to the drift entrance so you go boom
fire<00:03:33.920> was<00:03:34.190> sorry<00:03:34.430> you<00:03:35.030> start<00:03:35.360> with<00:03:35.420> the<00:03:35.540> ebrake

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:35.959 
fire was sorry you start with the ebrake

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:38.199 
fire was sorry you start with the ebrake
so<00:03:36.890> you<00:03:36.950> barely<00:03:37.250> want<00:03:37.459> to<00:03:37.580> happen<00:03:37.790> so<00:03:37.910> here<00:03:38.090> he

so you barely want to happen so here he
comes<00:03:38.450> here<00:03:38.750> it<00:03:38.840> comes<00:03:38.950> you<00:03:39.950> go<00:03:40.160> turn<00:03:40.910> hit<00:03:41.329> the

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:41.420 
comes here it comes you go turn hit the

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:43.210 
comes here it comes you go turn hit the
e<00:03:41.450> breaking<00:03:41.930> down<00:03:42.140> really<00:03:42.440> fast<00:03:42.709> so<00:03:43.040> you're

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:43.220 
e breaking down really fast so you're

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:45.190 
e breaking down really fast so you're
going<00:03:43.340> to<00:03:43.400> shift<00:03:44.269> down<00:03:44.359> and<00:03:44.690> hit<00:03:44.780> the<00:03:44.870> brake

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:45.200 
going to shift down and hit the brake

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:49.240 
going to shift down and hit the brake
just<00:03:45.410> like<00:03:45.530> that<00:03:45.709> so<00:03:45.890> it's<00:03:46.040> easy<00:03:46.340> to<00:03:46.780> just<00:03:48.250> go

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:49.250 
just like that so it's easy to just go

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:50.680 
just like that so it's easy to just go
like<00:03:49.400> that<00:03:49.579> you<00:03:49.730> don't<00:03:49.760> have<00:03:50.000> to<00:03:50.150> hold<00:03:50.329> it<00:03:50.480> for

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:50.690 
like that you don't have to hold it for

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:52.990 
like that you don't have to hold it for
long<00:03:50.870> and<00:03:51.109> then<00:03:51.230> shift<00:03:51.530> down<00:03:51.790> but<00:03:52.790> you<00:03:52.820> just

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:53.000 
long and then shift down but you just

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.710 
long and then shift down but you just
gotta<00:03:53.530> just<00:03:54.530> like<00:03:54.650> that<00:03:54.859> and<00:03:55.700> then<00:03:56.329> once<00:03:56.540> you

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:56.720 
gotta just like that and then once you

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:59.650 
gotta just like that and then once you
are<00:03:57.230> in<00:03:57.440> the<00:03:57.530> drip<00:03:57.799> shift<00:03:58.640> down<00:03:58.820> again<00:03:59.209> when

00:03:59.650 --> 00:03:59.660 
are in the drip shift down again when

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:01.900 
are in the drip shift down again when
you<00:03:59.720> hit<00:03:59.840> the<00:03:59.959> middle<00:04:00.370> which<00:04:01.370> is<00:04:01.549> kind<00:04:01.790> of<00:04:01.850> like

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:01.910 
you hit the middle which is kind of like

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:04.750 
you hit the middle which is kind of like
the<00:04:01.970> you<00:04:02.510> know<00:04:02.829> mid<00:04:03.829> section<00:04:04.130> of<00:04:04.370> the<00:04:04.430> drift

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:04.760 
the you know mid section of the drift

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:09.490 
the you know mid section of the drift
and<00:04:04.970> then<00:04:06.519> if<00:04:07.519> once<00:04:08.450> you<00:04:08.540> get<00:04:08.780> into<00:04:08.930> the<00:04:09.079> end<00:04:09.320> of

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:09.500 
and then if once you get into the end of

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:11.890 
and then if once you get into the end of
the<00:04:09.620> drift<00:04:09.920> which<00:04:10.250> is<00:04:10.430> the<00:04:10.910> end<00:04:11.090> you<00:04:11.510> shift

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:11.900 
the drift which is the end you shift

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:16.029 
the drift which is the end you shift
down<00:04:12.019> again<00:04:12.350> and<00:04:13.180> you<00:04:14.180> should<00:04:14.420> be<00:04:15.039> steadied

00:04:16.029 --> 00:04:16.039 
down again and you should be steadied

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:18.069 
down again and you should be steadied
with<00:04:16.850> the<00:04:16.940> road<00:04:17.180> and<00:04:17.600> you<00:04:17.690> should<00:04:17.840> be<00:04:17.900> going

00:04:18.069 --> 00:04:18.079 
with the road and you should be going

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:21.310 
with the road and you should be going
straight<00:04:18.350> with<00:04:19.100> your<00:04:19.250> speed<00:04:19.549> still<00:04:20.320> it's

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:21.320 
straight with your speed still it's

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:24.480 
straight with your speed still it's
really<00:04:22.100> simple<00:04:22.419> drift<00:04:23.419> it's<00:04:23.840> not<00:04:23.930> that<00:04:23.990> hard

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:24.490 
really simple drift it's not that hard

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:28.870 
really simple drift it's not that hard
but<00:04:25.990> yep<00:04:26.990> yep<00:04:27.020> yep<00:04:27.229> that's<00:04:27.620> how<00:04:28.400> you<00:04:28.460> do<00:04:28.610> it<00:04:28.729> no

00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:39.289 
dress this is all about timing there's

00:04:39.289 --> 00:04:41.950 
dress this is all about timing there's
like<00:04:39.680> every<00:04:40.070> drift<00:04:40.430> there's<00:04:40.850> a<00:04:41.030> beginning<00:04:41.570> a

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:41.960 
like every drift there's a beginning a

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:45.150 
like every drift there's a beginning a
middle<00:04:42.080> and<00:04:42.800> an<00:04:42.919> end

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:45.160

what you want to do is you want to shift

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:51.390 
what you want to do is you want to shift

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:51.400 
down at the beginning shift down in a

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:54.660 
down at the beginning shift down in a
second<00:04:51.990> or<00:04:52.990> not<00:04:53.350> into<00:04:53.800> second<00:04:54.190> but<00:04:54.370> like<00:04:54.490> you
