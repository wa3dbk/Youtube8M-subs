00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:11.629
 modern friendly and bright so 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.070
 the new judicial center presents itself 

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:16.110
 korneuburg three years built the big im 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:19.020
 order of the Ministry of Justice and 

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:21.090
 invested about 77 million euros 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.640
 now are state and district court 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.529
 with state prosecutor as well 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:26.939
 Justice Institute in two buildings 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:28.859
 summarized both objects stand for 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.320
 but are alone by one 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:34.160
 underground gangway connected the 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.960
 courthouse is deliberately just around 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.910
 Light shafts erects the same time 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.739
 On the one hand serve to serve the development 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.260
 but for another, of course, too 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:46.250
 Exposure of internal offices 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.360
 It is so that there are several 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:51.269
 Objects are in turn by the 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.820
 external security act as a single entity 

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:55.500
 and that's how this polarity arises 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.330
 of the two objects here in the square 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.820
 Both buildings have 

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:02.070
 a total of 33,000 square meters 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.570
 net area in the court 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.640
 on the ground floor public 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.560
 facilities the administrative units 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.390
 of the state court in the second and 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.790
 third floor accommodated 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.100
 the work is structured a lot that is 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.960
 really optimized because little things in the 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.000
 interest of the customers right in the 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.430
 Entrance area in the infocenter done 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.470
 are each knows about from no 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.660
 no empty kilometer it really is 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.600
 Everything is really excellent as you are 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:29.640
 dish presents as a model and the same 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.480
 it has become also the judicial institution 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.710
 is a flagship object at around 16,700 

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:36.870
 square meters can be found recording and 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.840
 Discharge area sports areas as well 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:42.090
 most modern business and working enterprise 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.830
 In total, 262 passengers have space here 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.000
 the one or two man cells 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:46.409
 be housed 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.600
 in times of a frugal staff 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.370
 It is also necessary to manage it 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.570
 that way our judicial watch 

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:53.850
 officials have to go 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.340
 are very short and that will be in the new building 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.140
 absolutely guaranteed 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.150
 also the energetic thought that 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.280
 korneuburg justice center is worldwide 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:04.229
 the first object of this use in the 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.420
 passive house standard was built 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:10.479
 we receive 50 percent of our 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:12.580
 Heating energy via geothermal and 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:14.890
 they need to be better from two 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:17.560
 basic services so everything in 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:19.870
 a total concept for this 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.819
 care issues for optical highlights 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:24.250
 in addition to the modern architecture also eg 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:27.720
 card art projects on the one hand by hans 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:30.099
 Schabus the so-called Freitreppe the 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:33.340
 is housed in the jail area 

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:37.989
 in the courthouse there's nikolaus 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:40.329
 Gansterer a room installation the very 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:42.790
 good for relaxing the object 

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:45.579
 I'm sure it's that 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:47.650
 advanced functionally and 

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:50.879
 technically the best equipped 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:50.879
 court that there are in Austria
