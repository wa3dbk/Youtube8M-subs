00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.390
 not back you have to mess someone up 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.310
 to get that or if you meet 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:33.590
 exactly the cow back the whole trick 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.590
 The thing is with a total of only 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.610
 blackmore i just say a man has 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.469
 a total of 13 I now live've already 1 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:46.820
 lost and then you are out of the circle 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:52.620
 a very entertaining play mode boy 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:57.420
 I have perfect double perfect 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:59.910
 saved age where no 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.480
 ok now only as last life now 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.149
 I really have to 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.439
 the trick of the matter here is me 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.840
 myself am not good the 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:09.150
 It is even too bad to say 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.920
 fighting was okay to fight at the same time 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.510
 but also being aggressive at the same time 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.570
 with it a points so it really is 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.869
 a thin thread on which you go and me 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:21.680
 have not yet properly top of him 

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:21.680
 especially not so tasty 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:31.470
 so ok the longer it survives all the more 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.240
 points also get accordingly 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.340
 we are that for the skeletons 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.570
 Director, that's always the case here later 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.040
 are you then only three in the lobby 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:43.830
 or because they all ask directly 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:44.910
 but that's just how it really is 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:47.790
 Thrill 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:53.340

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.649
 exception 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.180
 I hope that's enough so short first 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:07.680

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.660

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.220

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.630
