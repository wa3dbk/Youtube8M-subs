00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.660 
actual unit let's take a quick look at
its<00:00:19.199> box<00:00:19.760> as<00:00:20.760> far<00:00:21.000> as<00:00:21.119> I<00:00:21.240> know<00:00:21.300> the<00:00:22.260> JBL<00:00:22.800> s700

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
its box as far as I know the JBL s700

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.000 
its box as far as I know the JBL s700
is<00:00:23.820> available<00:00:24.480> in<00:00:24.600> two<00:00:24.779> colors<00:00:24.949> black<00:00:25.949> and

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
is available in two colors black and

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.689 
is available in two colors black and
white<00:00:26.310> and<00:00:27.289> judging<00:00:28.289> by<00:00:28.320> the<00:00:28.500> packaging<00:00:29.490> I

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
white and judging by the packaging I

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.150 
white and judging by the packaging I
think<00:00:30.240> we<00:00:30.359> can<00:00:30.539> safely<00:00:30.869> assume<00:00:31.050> that<00:00:31.320> we<00:00:31.859> are

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
think we can safely assume that we are

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.080 
think we can safely assume that we are
getting<00:00:32.579> the<00:00:32.790> black<00:00:33.239> version<00:00:34.730> so<00:00:35.730> while<00:00:35.910> we're

let's<00:01:28.920> see<00:01:29.100> what<00:01:29.340> else<00:01:29.490> we<00:01:29.729> have<00:01:29.759> here<00:01:31.009> alright

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
let's see what else we have here alright

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.399 
let's see what else we have here alright
so<00:01:32.280> it<00:01:32.430> seems<00:01:32.670> that<00:01:32.850> the<00:01:33.030> S<00:01:33.150> 700<00:01:33.750> comes<00:01:34.020> with<00:01:34.380> a

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
so it seems that the S 700 comes with a

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.230 
so it seems that the S 700 comes with a
pair<00:01:34.740> of<00:01:34.770> audio<00:01:35.159> cables<00:01:35.579> with<00:01:35.850> inline
