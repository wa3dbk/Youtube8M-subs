00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
has been a little cryptic to me in the

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.170 
has been a little cryptic to me in the
past<00:00:22.470> so<00:00:22.680> I<00:00:22.740> never<00:00:22.859> messed<00:00:23.250> with<00:00:23.400> it<00:00:23.609> but

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
past so I never messed with it but

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.300 
past so I never messed with it but
recently<00:00:24.570> I've<00:00:24.750> come<00:00:24.779> to<00:00:25.140> understand<00:00:25.619> how<00:00:26.130> it

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
recently I've come to understand how it

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.990 
recently I've come to understand how it
works<00:00:26.550> so<00:00:27.390> you<00:00:27.859> have<00:00:28.859> ten<00:00:29.070> policies<00:00:29.640> here<00:00:29.849> that

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
works so you have ten policies here that

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:30.769 
works so you have ten policies here that
you<00:00:30.060> can<00:00:30.240> select

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
so as you make rules for certain times

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.459

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:29.220 
have the choice of either filtering or

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:32.450 
have the choice of either filtering or
just<00:04:30.220> blocking<00:04:30.640> Internet<00:04:31.330> access<00:04:31.480> altogether

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:32.460 
just blocking Internet access altogether

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:36.090
