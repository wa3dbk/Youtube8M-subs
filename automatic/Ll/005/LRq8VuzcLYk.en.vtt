00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:07.760
 Welcome to the mathematical channel for 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:10.860
 to win this channel came from the following 

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:13.910
 I wrote this math book for 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:17.970
 winning teaching mathematics teaching 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:20.369
 fundamental until the sixth year 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:24.269
 The main objective is to prepare young 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:27.840
 to take the test in irna college 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:33.329
 to enter the sixth year then they are about 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:35.910
 of 3500 questions is all with answer and 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:39.300
 more or less half of them are with the 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:41.790
 solutions developed here you learn 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:45.059
 matter and also has issues that 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:48.780
 they fell in contests of the military college 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:50.820
 will stay in the naval college of the Olympiad 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:54.050
 of math and more competition 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:57.059
 so you learn here is divisibility 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:01:00.480
 fractions numbers decimals powers 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:03.359
 percentage system sets of measures 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.369
 measures when they notions about 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:09.630
 with actions also have a chapter on 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:12.869
 simulated tests to help in the study 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.790
 health book that they will want 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.350
 learn math around here i did 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.619
 these videos that you see there 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:25.740
 these videos were all gathered in 10 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:28.320
 dvds of the anointing dvds where the 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:32.790
 the book every chapter of the book 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:35.700
 and is made as follows the matter 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:38.100
 taught has several examples 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.170
 then several exercises at the end 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:43.020
 simulated proof of this departure itself in 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.640
 matter is exactly what you find 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.820
 here in these dvds 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:50.009
 so here is the video corresponding to 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.049
 each chapter of the book and the 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:54.659
 videos that are on these ten dvds are 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:57.270
 exactly the ones that are in the 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:02:00.090
 channel on youtube ie you do not 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:03.030
 need to buy tvi do not need to 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.340
 You can access these bugs. 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:08.509
 free and 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.899
 hold all this mathematics until the sixth 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:12.200
 year 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:15.410
 now if you want I also asked for this 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.700
 to always see at home watching the room 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:19.459
 on the big screen 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:22.670
 but you can get the dvd this is 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:25.540
 same content you have in your 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:25.540
 group channel
