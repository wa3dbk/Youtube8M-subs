00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
days ago this section here and the mix

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.720 
days ago this section here and the mix
is<00:00:20.699> four<00:00:21.150> to<00:00:21.270> one<00:00:21.449> I<00:00:22.369> guess<00:00:23.369> we're<00:00:23.550> going<00:00:23.670> to

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
is four to one I guess we're going to

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.929 
is four to one I guess we're going to
I'd<00:00:24.390> like<00:00:24.570> to<00:00:24.689> be<00:00:24.779> able<00:00:24.840> to<00:00:24.930> adjust<00:00:25.080> that<00:00:25.410> mix

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
so it's a different color but for the

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.470 
so it's a different color but for the
one<00:00:28.949> is<00:00:29.070> that<00:00:29.250> is<00:00:29.429> the<00:00:29.730> thing<00:00:30.060> so<00:00:30.090> we're<00:00:30.359> going

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
here this is from from we did the big

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.200 
here this is from from we did the big
round<00:00:54.750> spot<00:00:55.399> with<00:00:56.399> the<00:00:56.520> pressure<00:00:56.760> washer<00:00:57.030> I

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
round spot with the pressure washer I

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.430 
round spot with the pressure washer I
went<00:00:57.360> crazy<00:00:57.570> with<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:57.960> pressure<00:00:58.199> washer

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
went crazy with the pressure washer

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.080 
went crazy with the pressure washer
trying<00:00:58.829> to<00:00:58.920> dig<00:00:59.070> this<00:00:59.219> stuff<00:00:59.430> out<00:00:59.579> we<00:00:59.699> did<00:00:59.910> some

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
trying to dig this stuff out we did some

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:00.709 
trying to dig this stuff out we did some
of<00:01:00.210> that<00:01:00.270> here

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
of that here

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.450 
of that here
I<00:01:00.750> think<00:01:01.379> dig<00:01:01.620> it<00:01:01.710> trying<00:01:01.920> to<00:01:02.010> dig<00:01:02.129> it<00:01:02.250> out<00:01:02.309> with

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
I think dig it trying to dig it out with

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.250 
I think dig it trying to dig it out with
the<00:01:02.550> pressure<00:01:02.789> washers<00:01:03.149> more<00:01:03.809> trouble<00:01:04.170> than

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
the pressure washers more trouble than

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.000 
the pressure washers more trouble than
it's<00:01:04.350> worth

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
it's worth

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.920 
it's worth
so<00:01:05.970> what<00:01:06.119> I've<00:01:06.210> been<00:01:06.299> doing<00:01:06.570> this<00:01:06.659> morning

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
so what I've been doing this morning

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.380 
so what I've been doing this morning
even<00:01:07.799> though<00:01:07.920> this<00:01:08.100> was<00:01:08.580> pressure<00:01:08.939> washed<00:01:09.240> it

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
even though this was pressure washed it

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.429 
even though this was pressure washed it
a<00:01:09.420> little<00:01:09.570> bit<00:01:09.920> I'm<00:01:10.920> having<00:01:11.280> to<00:01:11.340> take<00:01:11.520> tools

00:01:12.429 --> 00:01:12.439 
a little bit I'm having to take tools

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:18.050 
a little bit I'm having to take tools
and<00:01:13.439> go<00:01:13.950> around<00:01:14.220> and<00:01:14.670> clean<00:01:15.180> it<00:01:15.390> out<00:01:15.479> now<00:01:17.060> I'm

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
and go around and clean it out now I'm

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:26.330 
and go around and clean it out now I'm
using<00:01:20.390> reciprocating<00:01:21.390> saw<00:01:24.979> cut<00:01:25.979> some<00:01:26.159> of<00:01:26.250> that

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
using reciprocating saw cut some of that

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:32.929 
using reciprocating saw cut some of that
stuff<00:01:26.580> out<00:01:28.009> it<00:01:29.009> loosens<00:01:29.400> it<00:01:29.520> right<00:01:29.700> up<00:01:31.610> okay<00:01:32.610> so

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
stuff out it loosens it right up okay so

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.569 
stuff out it loosens it right up okay so
from<00:01:33.360> then<00:01:33.570> on<00:01:33.780> you<00:01:34.590> got<00:01:34.740> to<00:01:34.860> decide<00:01:35.130> how<00:01:35.369> much

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
from then on you got to decide how much

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:38.840 
from then on you got to decide how much
I<00:01:35.729> I<00:01:35.790> think<00:01:36.030> an<00:01:36.329> inch<00:01:36.509> is<00:01:36.750> good<00:01:37.640> there's<00:01:38.640> some

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
I I think an inch is good there's some

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.330 
I I think an inch is good there's some
get<00:01:39.119> there<00:01:39.450> over<00:01:39.960> here<00:01:40.140> I'm<00:01:40.590> running<00:01:40.950> into<00:01:41.070> the

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
get there over here I'm running into the

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.289 
get there over here I'm running into the
fact<00:01:41.700> that<00:01:41.790> the<00:01:41.939> bricks<00:01:42.750> or<00:01:42.930> a<00:01:42.960> lot<00:01:43.140> closer

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:44.299 
fact that the bricks or a lot closer

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:47.600 
fact that the bricks or a lot closer
together<00:01:45.500> so<00:01:46.500> it's<00:01:46.770> going<00:01:46.890> to<00:01:46.950> be<00:01:47.040> harder<00:01:47.520> to

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
together so it's going to be harder to

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.639 
together so it's going to be harder to
get<00:01:47.729> the<00:01:47.820> mortar<00:01:48.000> in<00:01:48.200> get<00:01:49.200> a<00:01:49.229> repair<00:01:49.619> job

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
get the mortar in get a repair job

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:55.340 
get the mortar in get a repair job
they're<00:01:50.130> slightly<00:01:50.820> wetter<00:01:51.570> mix<00:01:52.490> so<00:01:54.259> one<00:01:55.259> of

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
they're slightly wetter mix so one of

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.440 
they're slightly wetter mix so one of
the<00:01:55.439> most<00:01:55.590> handy<00:01:55.920> tools<00:01:56.189> is<00:01:56.759> this<00:01:57.030> thing<00:01:57.270> right

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
the most handy tools is this thing right

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:58.969 
the most handy tools is this thing right
here<00:01:57.509> if<00:01:57.719> it<00:01:57.840> is<00:01:58.020> that<00:01:58.229> many<00:01:58.439> paint<00:01:58.770> roller

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
here if it is that many paint roller

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.940 
here if it is that many paint roller
books<00:01:59.310> now<00:01:59.969> what<00:02:00.090> I've<00:02:00.210> learned<00:02:00.960> is<00:02:01.229> if<00:02:01.829> you

sure<00:02:13.860> you're<00:02:14.280> bringing<00:02:14.430> it<00:02:14.640> this<00:02:14.790> way<00:02:15.000> so<00:02:15.360> then

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
sure you're bringing it this way so then

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.380 
sure you're bringing it this way so then
I<00:02:15.600> take<00:02:16.370> any<00:02:17.370> kind<00:02:17.610> of<00:02:17.730> blade<00:02:17.940> that<00:02:17.970> you<00:02:18.150> like

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
I take any kind of blade that you like

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.530 
I take any kind of blade that you like
that<00:02:18.570> you<00:02:18.630> feel<00:02:18.690> comfortable<00:02:19.020> with<00:02:20.420> cut<00:02:21.420> it

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
that you feel comfortable with cut it

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:22.580 
that you feel comfortable with cut it
out<00:02:21.660> that<00:02:21.810> way<00:02:21.990> and<00:02:22.110> what<00:02:22.230> I<00:02:22.260> think<00:02:22.530> is

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
out that way and what I think is

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.460 
out that way and what I think is
important<00:02:23.040> is<00:02:23.660> making<00:02:24.660> sure<00:02:24.840> the<00:02:24.960> sides<00:02:25.230> are

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
important is making sure the sides are

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.960 
important is making sure the sides are
clean<00:02:27.440> as<00:02:28.440> clean<00:02:28.740> as<00:02:28.860> you<00:02:28.890> can<00:02:28.980> get<00:02:29.310> another

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
clean as clean as you can get another

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:34.100 
clean as clean as you can get another
way<00:02:30.180> it<00:02:30.240> will<00:02:30.300> stick<00:02:30.570> better<00:02:30.750> and<00:02:32.930> so<00:02:33.930> then

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
way it will stick better and so then

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:35.540 
way it will stick better and so then
when<00:02:34.320> I<00:02:34.350> put<00:02:34.650> the<00:02:34.770> mortar<00:02:35.070> in<00:02:35.160> here's<00:02:35.400> the

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
when I put the mortar in here's the

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:39.050 
when I put the mortar in here's the
mortar<00:02:35.850> this<00:02:36.480> is<00:02:36.690> a<00:02:36.750> four<00:02:37.020> to<00:02:37.110> one<00:02:37.260> mix<00:02:37.910> so<00:02:38.910> it's

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
mortar this is a four to one mix so it's

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.650 
mortar this is a four to one mix so it's
stiff<00:02:39.450> I<00:02:40.430> can't<00:02:41.430> do<00:02:41.550> it<00:02:41.640> yet<00:02:41.760> still<00:02:42.330> got<00:02:42.480> some

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
stiff I can't do it yet still got some

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:43.970 
stiff I can't do it yet still got some
stuff<00:02:42.930> back<00:02:43.080> there<00:02:43.290> that<00:02:43.440> needs<00:02:43.620> a<00:02:43.680> little<00:02:43.830> bit

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
stuff back there that needs a little bit

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.090 
stuff back there that needs a little bit
of<00:02:44.040> cleaning<00:02:44.370> up<00:02:44.460> but<00:02:44.670> we<00:02:44.880> could<00:02:45.060> do<00:02:45.950> look<00:02:46.950> at

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
of cleaning up but we could do look at

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:50.720 
of cleaning up but we could do look at
you<00:02:47.190> a<00:02:47.250> joint<00:02:47.580> where<00:02:48.450> is<00:02:48.540> it<00:02:48.690> so<00:02:49.440> then<00:02:49.650> first<00:02:50.550> of

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
you a joint where is it so then first of

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.300 
you a joint where is it so then first of
all<00:02:50.850> you<00:02:50.970> can<00:02:51.120> take<00:02:51.270> take<00:02:51.810> the<00:02:51.960> trowel<00:02:52.310> and

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
all you can take take the trowel and

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.840 
all you can take take the trowel and
just<00:02:53.820> beat<00:02:54.030> it<00:02:54.180> down<00:02:54.300> in<00:02:54.510> there<00:02:55.610> okay<00:02:56.610> or<00:02:56.760> you

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
just beat it down in there okay or you

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:01.100 
just beat it down in there okay or you
can<00:02:57.000> do<00:02:57.090> an<00:02:57.210> area<00:02:57.800> take<00:02:58.800> the<00:02:59.600> paint<00:03:00.600> roller<00:03:00.840> and

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
can do an area take the paint roller and

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:04.850 
can do an area take the paint roller and
just<00:03:01.650> pack<00:03:02.490> it<00:03:02.520> down<00:03:02.790> in<00:03:03.000> there<00:03:03.710> that's<00:03:04.710> what

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
just pack it down in there that's what

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:10.250 
just pack it down in there that's what
you<00:03:04.980> want<00:03:05.100> is<00:03:05.220> good<00:03:06.090> packing<00:03:08.930> get<00:03:09.930> it<00:03:10.020> packed

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
you want is good packing get it packed

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:11.810 
you want is good packing get it packed
down<00:03:10.470> in<00:03:10.560> there<00:03:10.710> and<00:03:11.100> then<00:03:11.280> that's<00:03:11.430> like<00:03:11.700> to

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:11.820 
down in there and then that's like to

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:13.970 
down in there and then that's like to
say<00:03:11.940> that's<00:03:12.060> an<00:03:12.210> inch<00:03:12.440> now<00:03:13.440> when<00:03:13.590> we<00:03:13.710> did<00:03:13.830> the

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
say that's an inch now when we did the

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:15.590 
say that's an inch now when we did the
pressure<00:03:14.220> washing<00:03:14.520> actually<00:03:15.030> the<00:03:15.150> ground<00:03:15.360> got

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:15.600 
pressure washing actually the ground got

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.600 
pressure washing actually the ground got
softer<00:03:16.140> so<00:03:16.290> it's<00:03:16.410> having<00:03:16.530> to<00:03:16.710> pile<00:03:17.220> it<00:03:17.400> a<00:03:17.460> lot

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:17.610 
softer so it's having to pile it a lot

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:19.640 
softer so it's having to pile it a lot
in<00:03:17.790> there<00:03:17.970> now<00:03:18.510> here's<00:03:18.720> the<00:03:18.900> most<00:03:19.050> useful<00:03:19.440> tool

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
in there now here's the most useful tool

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:24.200 
in there now here's the most useful tool
for<00:03:19.830> me<00:03:20.010> on<00:03:20.610> this<00:03:21.050> this<00:03:22.050> little<00:03:23.150> trial<00:03:24.150> and

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:24.210 
for me on this this little trial and

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:26.870 
for me on this this little trial and
it's<00:03:24.630> nice<00:03:24.840> and<00:03:25.050> soft<00:03:25.320> on<00:03:25.650> the<00:03:25.740> end<00:03:25.950> and<00:03:26.220> it

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
it's nice and soft on the end and it

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.090 
it's nice and soft on the end and it
really<00:03:27.180> really<00:03:27.930> does<00:03:28.080> the<00:03:28.110> trick<00:03:28.290> so<00:03:28.890> you<00:03:28.980> can

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:29.100 
really really does the trick so you can

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:34.190 
really really does the trick so you can
get<00:03:29.220> in<00:03:29.340> there<00:03:29.490> pack<00:03:30.420> it<00:03:30.600> down<00:03:32.480> and<00:03:33.480> then<00:03:34.080> the

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
get in there pack it down and then the

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:38.300 
get in there pack it down and then the
more<00:03:34.380> you<00:03:34.410> work<00:03:34.740> this<00:03:35.540> tool<00:03:36.740> with<00:03:37.740> a<00:03:37.980> little

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
more you work this tool with a little

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:39.860 
more you work this tool with a little
bit<00:03:38.400> of<00:03:38.430> water<00:03:38.730> in<00:03:38.910> there<00:03:38.940> the<00:03:39.180> smoother<00:03:39.690> the

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
bit of water in there the smoother the

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:41.240 
bit of water in there the smoother the
surface<00:03:40.260> will<00:03:40.410> be<00:03:40.530> when<00:03:40.680> you<00:03:40.770> get<00:03:40.860> done<00:03:41.070> if

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
surface will be when you get done if

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.610 
surface will be when you get done if
that's<00:03:41.460> what<00:03:41.640> you're<00:03:41.730> looking<00:03:41.970> for<00:03:42.380> so<00:03:43.380> then

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
that's what you're looking for so then

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:47.210 
that's what you're looking for so then
you<00:03:43.680> just<00:03:43.890> move<00:03:44.760> into<00:03:44.910> the<00:03:45.060> next<00:03:45.300> one<00:03:45.420> and<00:03:46.220> keep

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
you just move into the next one and keep

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:51.290 
you just move into the next one and keep
going<00:03:48.230> so<00:03:49.230> I'm<00:03:49.380> just<00:03:49.560> trying<00:03:49.770> to<00:03:49.800> do<00:03:49.950> some<00:03:50.300> keep

cleaning then come back to some more

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:58.040 
cleaning then come back to some more
mortar<00:03:56.880> in<00:03:57.000> as<00:03:57.210> I<00:03:57.630> go<00:03:57.780> along

00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:58.050 
mortar in as I go along

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:00.410 
mortar in as I go along
maybe<00:03:58.290> that's<00:03:58.470> the<00:03:58.620> plan<00:03:58.950> for<00:03:59.280> anybody<00:04:00.150> clean

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:00.420 
maybe that's the plan for anybody clean

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:03.320 
maybe that's the plan for anybody clean
a<00:04:00.450> section<00:04:00.900> put<00:04:01.140> some<00:04:01.320> mortar<00:04:01.590> in<00:04:02.120> come<00:04:03.120> to<00:04:03.240> the

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:03.330 
a section put some mortar in come to the

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:04.760 
a section put some mortar in come to the
next<00:04:03.600> section

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:04.770 
next section

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:06.560 
next section
very<00:04:05.370> long<00:04:05.580> so<00:04:05.790> that's<00:04:05.910> what<00:04:06.120> we're<00:04:06.300> at<00:04:06.360> a

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:06.570 
very long so that's what we're at a

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:08.060 
very long so that's what we're at a
little<00:04:06.900> bit<00:04:06.990> of<00:04:07.020> vacuuming<00:04:07.470> over<00:04:07.770> there<00:04:07.890> now

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:08.070 
little bit of vacuuming over there now

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:10.250 
little bit of vacuuming over there now
I'm<00:04:08.160> ready<00:04:08.340> to<00:04:08.520> start<00:04:08.730> putting<00:04:08.940> some<00:04:09.180> work<00:04:09.330> and
