00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:41.100 
what the scale is that one so I'm gonna
go<00:02:36.370> and<00:02:37.370> I<00:02:37.489> know<00:02:37.550> this<00:02:37.910> next<00:02:38.150> note<00:02:38.330> is<00:02:39.290> B<00:02:39.620> so

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.110 
go and I know this next note is B so

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:45.090 
go and I know this next note is B so
right<00:02:42.110> and<00:02:42.319> then<00:02:42.920> I<00:02:42.950> know<00:02:43.069> that<00:02:43.459> a<00:02:43.819> major

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:45.100 
right and then I know that a major

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:47.290 
right and then I know that a major
pattern<00:02:46.100> is<00:02:46.220> right<00:02:46.400> yeah<00:02:46.730> that's<00:02:47.060> a<00:02:47.150> real

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:47.300 
pattern is right yeah that's a real

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:52.330 
pattern is right yeah that's a real
common<00:02:47.540> one<00:02:47.810> so<00:02:47.989> I'm<00:02:48.049> gonna<00:02:48.140> go<00:02:51.250> I'm<00:02:52.250> gonna

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
common one so I'm gonna go I'm gonna

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.460 
common one so I'm gonna go I'm gonna
jump<00:02:52.700> up<00:02:52.910> one<00:02:53.120> more<00:02:53.390> the<00:02:53.840> next<00:02:54.140> note<00:02:54.260> in<00:02:54.380> the

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 
jump up one more the next note in the

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:57.220 
jump up one more the next note in the
scale<00:02:54.730> is<00:02:55.730> their<00:02:56.000> major<00:02:56.329> scale<00:02:56.690> and<00:02:56.959> the<00:02:57.019> next

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
scale is their major scale and the next

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:03.940 
scale is their major scale and the next
ones<00:02:57.410> here<00:02:57.620> so<00:03:02.170> so<00:03:03.170> that's<00:03:03.350> how<00:03:03.440> you<00:03:03.500> know<00:03:03.650> what

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950 
ones here so so that's how you know what

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:05.590 
ones here so so that's how you know what
notes<00:03:04.220> to<00:03:04.430> choose<00:03:04.700> to<00:03:04.970> do<00:03:05.090> these<00:03:05.209> two<00:03:05.420> note

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:05.600 
notes to choose to do these two note

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:15.220 
notes to choose to do these two note
chords<00:03:06.049> now<00:03:12.640> if<00:03:13.640> this<00:03:13.760> was<00:03:13.940> an<00:03:14.060> a<00:03:14.239> minor<00:03:14.630> then<00:03:15.140> I

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.230 
chords now if this was an a minor then I

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:17.039 
chords now if this was an a minor then I
would<00:03:15.350> just<00:03:15.500> use<00:03:15.680> the<00:03:15.829> a<00:03:15.859> minor<00:03:16.250> scale<00:03:16.370> and

00:03:17.039 --> 00:03:17.049 
would just use the a minor scale and

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:19.630 
would just use the a minor scale and
that<00:03:18.049> would<00:03:18.230> sound<00:03:18.440> using<00:03:18.950> the<00:03:19.130> same<00:03:19.370> rhythm

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:19.640 
that would sound using the same rhythm

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:34.770 
that would sound using the same rhythm
what<00:03:20.450> sound<00:03:20.660> like<00:03:20.810> this

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:34.780 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:36.970 

you<00:03:35.780> can<00:03:35.930> get<00:03:36.079> real<00:03:36.260> creative<00:03:36.590> with<00:03:36.859> these

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:36.980 
you can get real creative with these

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:38.289 
you can get real creative with these
chord<00:03:37.310> patterns<00:03:37.700> you<00:03:37.790> could<00:03:37.879> slow<00:03:38.150> it<00:03:38.269> down

00:03:38.289 --> 00:03:38.299 
chord patterns you could slow it down

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:40.449 
chord patterns you could slow it down
and<00:03:39.140> you've<00:03:39.260> probably<00:03:39.530> heard<00:03:39.769> something<00:03:40.189> like

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:40.459 
and you've probably heard something like

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:46.650 
and you've probably heard something like
this<00:03:40.700> many<00:03:41.000> times

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:46.660 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:49.780 

very<00:03:47.660> common<00:03:48.140> chord<00:03:48.890> progression<00:03:49.400> doing<00:03:49.640> the

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:49.790 
very common chord progression doing the

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:53.200 
very common chord progression doing the
a<00:03:50.120> G<00:03:51.110> to<00:03:51.260> F<00:03:51.470> so<00:03:52.220> there's<00:03:52.430> your<00:03:52.550> example<00:03:53.000> in

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:53.210 
a G to F so there's your example in

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:55.660 
a G to F so there's your example in
using<00:03:53.750> the<00:03:53.840> minor<00:03:54.080> scale<00:03:54.290> now<00:03:55.130> of<00:03:55.280> course<00:03:55.490> this

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:55.670 
using the minor scale now of course this

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:57.340 
using the minor scale now of course this
is<00:03:55.790> going<00:03:55.910> to<00:03:55.970> sound<00:03:56.120> best<00:03:56.540> with<00:03:56.810> the<00:03:56.960> open

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:57.350 
is going to sound best with the open

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:00.610 
is going to sound best with the open
strings<00:03:57.770> D<00:03:58.220> a<00:03:58.550> and<00:03:58.970> E<00:03:59.300> so<00:04:00.080> if<00:04:00.230> you're<00:04:00.350> gonna<00:04:00.440> do

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:00.620 
strings D a and E so if you're gonna do

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:03.340 
strings D a and E so if you're gonna do
it<00:04:00.740> in<00:04:00.830> D<00:04:00.980> minor<00:04:01.310> you<00:04:01.850> would<00:04:01.970> just<00:04:02.120> pick<00:04:03.050> the<00:04:03.200> D

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:03.350 
it in D minor you would just pick the D

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:06.550 
it in D minor you would just pick the D
minor<00:04:03.620> scale<00:04:03.830> to<00:04:04.400> choose<00:04:04.760> your<00:04:05.660> chord<00:04:06.320> tones

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:06.560 
minor scale to choose your chord tones

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:17.020 
minor scale to choose your chord tones
so<00:04:07.280> I<00:04:07.310> know<00:04:07.520> I've<00:04:07.730> got<00:04:09.550> there<00:04:15.519> so<00:04:16.519> then<00:04:16.880> it

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:17.030 
so I know I've got there so then it

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:31.810 
so I know I've got there so then it
would<00:04:17.120> sound<00:04:17.330> something<00:04:17.510> like<00:04:17.720> this<00:04:30.610> and<00:04:31.610> you

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:31.820 
would sound something like this and you

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:34.090 
would sound something like this and you
can<00:04:32.000> experiment<00:04:32.750> around<00:04:32.840> once<00:04:33.680> you<00:04:33.740> know<00:04:33.920> what

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:34.100 
can experiment around once you know what

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:36.580 
can experiment around once you know what
notes<00:04:34.820> to<00:04:35.000> choose<00:04:35.240> from<00:04:35.540> try<00:04:36.170> to<00:04:36.230> flip<00:04:36.440> them

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:36.590 
notes to choose from try to flip them

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:38.170 
notes to choose from try to flip them
around<00:04:36.680> I<00:04:37.010> like<00:04:37.130> to<00:04:37.250> take<00:04:37.430> regular<00:04:37.640> patterns

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:38.180 
around I like to take regular patterns

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:40.690 
around I like to take regular patterns
and<00:04:38.330> just<00:04:38.360> kind<00:04:38.600> of<00:04:38.660> do<00:04:38.810> like<00:04:38.930> do<00:04:39.110> this<00:04:39.700> and

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:40.700 
and just kind of do like do this and

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:45.850 
and just kind of do like do this and
then<00:04:40.850> just<00:04:41.060> swap<00:04:41.720> strings<00:04:44.380> they're<00:04:45.380> still<00:04:45.650> in

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:45.860 
then just swap strings they're still in

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:47.380 
then just swap strings they're still in
the<00:04:45.980> scale<00:04:46.250> I<00:04:46.280> know<00:04:46.520> what<00:04:46.790> the<00:04:46.880> scale<00:04:47.150> notes

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:47.390 
the scale I know what the scale notes

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:49.720 
the scale I know what the scale notes
are<00:04:47.630> so<00:04:47.840> I'm<00:04:47.930> not<00:04:48.050> just<00:04:48.230> doing<00:04:48.340> totally<00:04:49.340> random

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:49.730 
are so I'm not just doing totally random

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:51.070 
are so I'm not just doing totally random
notes<00:04:49.940> but<00:04:50.150> I<00:04:50.210> like<00:04:50.360> messing<00:04:50.750> around<00:04:50.870> with

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:51.080 
notes but I like messing around with

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:53.020 
notes but I like messing around with
patterns<00:04:51.530> like<00:04:51.710> that<00:04:51.770> and<00:04:52.130> then<00:04:52.640> you<00:04:52.730> come<00:04:52.910> up

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:53.030 
patterns like that and then you come up

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:54.430 
patterns like that and then you come up
with<00:04:53.150> really<00:04:53.300> cool<00:04:53.540> sounding<00:04:53.870> stuff<00:04:54.140> just

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:54.440 
with really cool sounding stuff just

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:58.480 
with really cool sounding stuff just
playing<00:04:54.770> around<00:04:55.600> you<00:04:56.600> can<00:04:56.720> do<00:04:57.070> keep<00:04:58.070> one

00:04:58.480 --> 00:04:58.490 
playing around you can do keep one

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:04.300 
playing around you can do keep one
finger<00:04:58.910> here<00:05:02.320> drop<00:05:03.320> this<00:05:03.530> one<00:05:03.710> down<00:05:03.860> the<00:05:03.919> scale

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:04.310 
finger here drop this one down the scale

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:05.620 
finger here drop this one down the scale
to<00:05:04.490> the<00:05:04.580> next<00:05:04.790> note<00:05:04.970> and<00:05:05.180> keep<00:05:05.330> the<00:05:05.419> same

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:05.630 
to the next note and keep the same

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:15.339 
to the next note and keep the same
pattern<00:05:05.960> on<00:05:06.020> top

00:05:15.339 --> 00:05:15.349 

00:05:15.349 --> 00:05:18.860 

you<00:05:16.349> can<00:05:16.500> also<00:05:16.789> pick<00:05:17.789> notes<00:05:18.030> higher<00:05:18.360> up<00:05:18.659> or

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:18.870 
you can also pick notes higher up or

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:21.439 
you can also pick notes higher up or
lower<00:05:19.229> down<00:05:19.530> if<00:05:20.370> you<00:05:20.550> liked<00:05:20.729> that<00:05:20.759> song<00:05:21.210> the

00:05:21.439 --> 00:05:21.449 
lower down if you liked that song the

00:05:21.449 --> 00:05:23.300 
lower down if you liked that song the
zoo<00:05:21.629> by<00:05:21.840> the<00:05:21.900> scorpions<00:05:22.560> they're<00:05:22.830> doing<00:05:23.129> a

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:23.310 
zoo by the scorpions they're doing a

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:26.089 
zoo by the scorpions they're doing a
similar<00:05:23.879> thing<00:05:24.030> on<00:05:24.360> the<00:05:24.479> low<00:05:24.629> e-string

00:05:26.089 --> 00:05:26.099 
similar thing on the low e-string

00:05:26.099 --> 00:05:28.459 
similar thing on the low e-string
it<00:05:27.090> sounds<00:05:27.479> great<00:05:27.689> to<00:05:27.870> throw<00:05:28.080> in<00:05:28.229> the<00:05:28.319> higher

00:05:28.459 --> 00:05:28.469 
it sounds great to throw in the higher

00:05:28.469 --> 00:05:30.679 
it sounds great to throw in the higher
strings<00:05:28.919> the<00:05:29.129> B<00:05:29.430> and<00:05:29.789> E<00:05:30.090> strings<00:05:30.479> especially

00:05:30.679 --> 00:05:30.689 
strings the B and E strings especially

sounding

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:46.280 

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:48.860 

and<00:05:47.280> even<00:05:47.520> with<00:05:47.640> the<00:05:47.730> D<00:05:47.880> minor<00:05:48.180> thing<00:05:48.480> throwing

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:48.870
