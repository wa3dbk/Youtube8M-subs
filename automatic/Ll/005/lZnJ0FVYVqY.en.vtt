available from the Sony website so let's

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:50.050 
available from the Sony website so let's
get<00:00:48.950> into<00:00:49.190> it<00:00:49.310> and<00:00:49.430> have<00:00:49.550> a<00:00:49.579> look<00:00:49.760> at<00:00:49.850> some<00:00:50.030> of

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:50.060 
get into it and have a look at some of

00:00:50.060 --> 00:01:16.400 
get into it and have a look at some of
the<00:00:50.180> wire<00:00:50.329> sounds<00:00:50.780> so<00:00:51.500> this<00:00:51.680> is<00:00:51.860> my<00:00:52.040> reference

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:16.410 

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:47.600 

nice<00:01:17.410> wallets

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.780 

nice<00:01:48.610> so<00:01:49.090> if<00:01:49.150> you<00:01:49.390> hold<00:01:49.780> down<00:01:50.110> the<00:01:51.040> up<00:01:51.340> and<00:01:51.610> down

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:51.790 
nice so if you hold down the up and down

00:01:51.790 --> 00:02:03.270 
nice so if you hold down the up and down
it<00:01:52.360> will<00:01:53.040> scroll<00:01:54.040> up<00:01:54.340> through<00:01:54.580> ten<00:02:01.619> so<00:02:02.619> not

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.280 
it will scroll up through ten so not

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.900 
it will scroll up through ten so not
only<00:02:03.430> does<00:02:03.940> the<00:02:04.119> pedal<00:02:04.450> control<00:02:04.990> the<00:02:05.770> Y<00:02:06.430> also

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:06.910 
only does the pedal control the Y also

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:10.199 
only does the pedal control the Y also
controls<00:02:07.540> the<00:02:07.960> speed<00:02:08.320> of<00:02:08.590> the<00:02:09.190> oscillation<00:02:10.000> on

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:10.209 
controls the speed of the oscillation on

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:11.820 
controls the speed of the oscillation on
some<00:02:10.509> of<00:02:10.570> the<00:02:10.660> effects<00:02:11.110> I'll<00:02:11.650> just

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
some of the effects I'll just

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:27.870 
some of the effects I'll just
demonstrate<00:02:25.470> some<00:02:26.470> other<00:02:26.980> patches<00:02:27.730> we've

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880 
demonstrate some other patches we've

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.210 
demonstrate some other patches we've
moved<00:02:28.120> onto<00:02:28.330> one<00:02:28.600> now<00:02:28.780> that's<00:02:29.050> create<00:02:29.830> sort<00:02:30.130> of

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
moved onto one now that's create sort of

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:32.550 
moved onto one now that's create sort of
its<00:02:30.400> own<00:02:30.640> sort<00:02:31.060> beat<00:02:31.330> you<00:02:31.570> can<00:02:31.690> set<00:02:31.989> the<00:02:32.110> tempo

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
its own sort beat you can set the tempo

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.500 
its own sort beat you can set the tempo
with<00:02:33.130> the<00:02:33.400> pedal<00:02:33.880> so<00:02:34.120> this<00:02:34.270> is<00:02:34.360> what<00:02:34.480> that
