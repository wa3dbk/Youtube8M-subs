00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:15.839
 hey people i am marita swisspro 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.730
 and welcome you to a renewed motto 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.260
 come up with five gameplay comments 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.020
 my channel but today it should be 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:25.470
 not about the play but about it 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:28.619
 that ios 9 was announced that will be in 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.990
 come out in the fall and what's new there and 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.870
 although particularly related to gaming 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:36.149
 because apple was in a good mood there 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.550
 what is there to come out infos 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:41.370
 abandoned and there has pretty blatant 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:44.340
 things and therefore I would 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.590
 say just stay tuned and I will 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.989
 Definitely explain it at ios 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.270
 8 came to me something new and that is the 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:54.300
 it was probably not all metal 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.789
 Metal is just that mountains graphic 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.590
 with less processor power 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.719
 because you can use medium and not 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.140
 opengl or whatever 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:05.369
 In any case you can play like that 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.260
 use the performance for the players 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.240
 use and not for that for that 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.740
 system or whatever else already 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.689
 was quite a big advantage 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.750
 then they had her kit 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.909
 and the pride of being fit for the wide kit 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.470
 is easy for two-dimensional 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:21.720
 Graphics has been and still is 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:25.140
 for that and the 10 kit is easy with it 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:27.180
 to get better three-dimensional objects in 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.939
 show any animations 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:32.100
 in a video game that was before 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:33.240
 pretty revolutionary but apple does 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.509
 actually continue 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:40.560
 That's what I found that Kassel because 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:42.150
 yesterday was just this table dc 2015 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.579
 and there they have all the new ones 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:47.700
 things are announced and indeed there are new 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:49.710
 the gameplay kit though you can use it 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.630
 to somehow do better in the play 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.939
 so that the gameplay is even better 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.649
 not something with intelligent opponents 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:57.450
 do not know what's right here 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:59.939
 in any case 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.530
 then you have ended model euro as 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:03.960
 kit again 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.479
 so you can better three-dimensional 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:09.209
 objects with the graphics engine and what 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:11.550
 but always represent what am 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:13.560
 This is the most interesting for everything 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:16.680
 replay kit and that is 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:19.560
 a kit that allows the db lopez 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:22.410
 replays of these gameplays you 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.750
 to bring the user to bring, of course 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:26.099
 can one say now that does not bring 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.349
 a lot i want my processor performance 

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:31.170
 from my ipad he two exclusively 

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:32.700
 for artwork i have a macbook and me 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.410
 can record that was mine 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.030
 point of view actually but I think so 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:38.280
 Great possibility because you with it 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.530
 maybe record high quality 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.959
 can and can record on the go 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:45.180
 which would of course be a huge advantage 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:47.220
 to earn any gameplay 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:50.310
 and overall and that will be easy 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:52.470
 gaming hopefully revolutionize that 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:54.750
 everyone can share his gameplays and 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:57.060
 So finally gameplay standards on 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:59.730
 Youtube reigns there are definitely 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.590
 youtuber on youtube that just crap 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.360
 use as a gameplay bit and say 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:05.340
 that mobile gaming and what also 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.140
 I always hope nobody feels there 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:09.000
 addressed or so but you know what 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:10.560
 I mean and you could do that 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.690
 for example, avoid 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:15.299
 that would just be a great new feature 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:16.769
 but of course I hope so too 

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:19.950
 record with this 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:21.780
 The whole thing is that you can do that 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:24.420
 everyone can play and that all 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:26.340
 have to have new games because you 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.880
 I have seen metal as well 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.459
 seen 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:32.760
 it was just like apple grounded that 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:35.760
 and somehow now there are 20 games 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:38.100
 at most not even like that support 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.870
 which of course is very very weak 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:41.940
 this masterpiece of apple 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:43.859
 but actually is medium for mac 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:45.900
 that means on mac you can then 

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:49.170
 also better go what course one 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:50.819
 great idea is of course i have one 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:53.400
 older mac there it will not be so good 

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:56.370
 But they are going to be very much there 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:58.769
 much change what hopefully the mobile 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:01.980
 makes gaming community bigger and still 

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:03.989
 makes it stronger because there are new people to us 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:06.329
 actually brings to modern combat 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:09.090
 hopefully also because modern combat 6 

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:11.489
 if that comes out i hope that will 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:13.410
 also support this whole stuff and 

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:15.900
 if that comes out i hope that comes 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:17.669
 somehow this year or next me 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:20.100
 I do not know but I do not have any 

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:22.080
 Information somehow gotten from 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:23.500
 any sources i will inform 

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:25.150
 then of course always 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:26.890
 and who cares I have this 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:27.670
 Information all from the apple 

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:29.620
 website 

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:31.630
 I have no information from 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:34.270
 youtube or so just because 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:36.280
 youtuber always your own view 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:37.900
 bring and say your view 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:41.380
 this issue i hope in any case 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:43.180
 you liked this video if it was 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:45.460
 that has definitely done that 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:49.710
 thumb there writes your opinion in the 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:49.710
 comments skin because people from 

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:30.550
 Yes 

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:02.840
 i
