00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:10.720
 this video is about the tool more 

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:12.820
 versatile in a situation of 

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:14.650
 survival I firmly believe that that 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:17.020
 tool is the 9-inch knife 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:19.210
 The most common knives are those of 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:21.460
 minor measures in fact decided to opt 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:23.769
 in my design by a configuration of 6 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:25.660
 inches however this knife a 

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:27.640
 combat knife or any other 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:30.099
 needs to be accompanied by tools 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:32.230
 specific to the work of elders 

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:34.690
 dimensions in a jungle peloton what 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:36.400
 most common is to find a machete of 21 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:38.290
 inches together with the knife 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:40.660
 standard combat or in an expedition of 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:42.700
 large scale it is most likely that 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:44.320
 finds an ax involved but in 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:46.570
 a camping for one or two people 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:48.460
 surely you will not have the possibility 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:50.590
 to carry a single tool for each 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:52.359
 work so the most sensible decision 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:54.219
 is to have the tool with which 

00:00:52.359 --> 00:00:56.680
 you can solve almost all 

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:58.930
 mishaps that tool is the knife 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:00.250
 of 9-inch survival here 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:02.140
 we have a selection of four 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:03.940
 knives that I consider to be from a 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:06.190
 superior performance in that category 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:08.740
 however, I will not talk about your 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:10.930
 many virtues I would rather mention 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:12.850
 shortly what I consider to be their 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:13.600
 deficiencies without any order in 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:17.320
 particular 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:20.170
 the nf sh of views and the venerable who was 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:22.690
 to his sms big brother the recognized 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:25.360
 becker scholarship 9 the version that there is bar 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:27.250
 and last but not least the 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:29.170
 rangers was from 9 to anoint and as 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.270
 you know these knives are not 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:32.320
 precisely cheap but they have had 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:34.659
 the opportunity to exchange 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:36.430
 information with me in a forum before or 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:38.470
 have had the opportunity to review my 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:40.659
 videos will remember that empathized 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:42.700
 strongly with the low camper 

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:44.770
 budget that can not afford a 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.840
 of these pieces and I do it because all 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:48.340
 we've been through there at some point 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.289
 I'm saying that the knives that go 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:54.429
 to see below are all the same 

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:56.590
 level but we activate mt 151 of emtech 

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:59.649
 the bowling montana of rich ground and the 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:02.050
 more and if 749 let's talk about some 

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:04.149
 weaknesses of these beauties I will begin 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:06.640
 with the most economical the reach rainer 

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:08.890
 It's made in India and they turned out to be 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.840
 Exceptionally good for the price 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:13.180
 but the finish is very poor they are not very 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.220
 consistent in their finished and sometimes 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.410
 the wood that by the way is about 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.420
 real wood has knots which 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:20.230
 they are visible the wood does not seem 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:22.239
 be stabilizing 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:23.739
 so the owner must have 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:26.920
 good care if you use it in 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:29.170
 NORAD wet conditions the 749 thousand 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.450
 Blackberries are very respectable knives 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:33.909
 high quality steel in a knife very 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:36.879
 economic the quality of mango and its 

00:02:33.909 --> 00:02:39.010
 Ergonomics are excellent but the sheet is 

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:40.900
 extremely thin and is not suitable for 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:42.700
 slice so efficiently with a 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:45.010
 Heavier knife can be obtained 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:47.110
 These in carbon steel or steel 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:49.120
 stainless I used one of steel to the 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:51.190
 carbon for many years as my 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.079
 main field knife although the 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:55.239
 carbon steel have better 

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:58.329
 retention of the edge are prone to 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:03:00.069
 easily stain the mt 151 

00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:04.480
 share the design with the legendary 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:06.579
 goldstein master and if it's 440 as it says 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.530
 the blade is a relatively steel 

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:10.720
 decent frosted in the Chinese by 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:13.180
 course but very good anyway 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:14.739
 in this case it is a very critical 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:16.959
 difficult because I think it 's a knife 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:19.870
 magnificent the weakness of this knife 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:22.209
 it will be the smoothness of 440 steel that 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:24.129
 makes sharpening and the quality of the 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:26.450
 rubber hand but he has never met 

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:29.420
 nobody who has been able to demonstrate 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:31.790
 in the temple process by folding it 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:33.980
 breaking it or any report 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:35.810
 that doubts the polymer of the handle 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:37.670
 allow yourself to do great ramblings 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:39.739
 over the four remaining knives is 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:41.810
 easy because these have been widely 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:44.060
 tested so anything that 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:46.760
 can be said will be objected by someone 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:48.500
 and it does not ultimately affect the reputation of 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:50.269
 the tool that ibar 'big brother' 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:52.670
 is the survival knife and 

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:55.190
 biggest fight I know strong 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:57.590
 fast very well designed although it is a 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:59.360
 fantastic knife I hate the fact that 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:01.099
 It has a very thin spike 

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:02.959
 I prefer knives not only with 

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:05.239
 full tang like this one but a 

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:07.910
 full profile spike like these 

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:09.980
 another three in the case of bk 9 is supposed 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:12.019
 which is a very ergonomic knife but 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:14.090
 the polymer of the grips although 

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:16.010
 fits the hands very well does not handle the 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:18.290
 water and other fluids in the same way 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:20.239
 It is too rigid for the hands and 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:22.880
 requires gloves to operate it in the 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:25.070
 most of the cases the rd 9 of ontario 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:27.410
 it's a wonderful knife 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:29.479
 it's surprisingly fast very well 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:31.880
 built and finished comes with grips 

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:32.630
 of my factory letter as opposed to 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:35.000
 the others 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:37.400
 It is available in two steels and two 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.840
 thicknesses and if you want to bring the 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:41.180
 things to the next level 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:43.940
 You can order a custom of just in 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:46.130
 which directly of the size you want 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:48.050
 and the thickness that is now without the 

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:50.060
 material restrictions the side 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:51.950
 negative of this beast is the study 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:54.350
 ergonomic handle the grips are 

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:56.660
 too cubic to be comfortable 

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:59.360
 but they are my letter and they can file 

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:01.850
 sandpaper everything you need but can not 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:03.500
 do nothing different to change the case 

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:05.720
 with which it comes but at least the 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:07.790
 economic but resilient foundation of 

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:11.150
 rangers of Ontario fulfills its purpose 

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:14.390
 something that can not be said about the NMF 

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:18.200
 shd view yes because it comes badly wrapped in 

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:20.210
 paper without sheath now the nm efe sh is 

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:22.640
 clearly the best knife of all 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:25.280
 these better built better ergonomics 

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:27.230
 in the mango much but much better 

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:29.390
 finished than any other knife that 

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:31.400
 can buy and the performance of the infa 

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:33.440
 exceeds any other 0 for 

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:36.320
 cutlery that exists in retention of 

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:38.120
 edge tenacity flexion tension and so on 

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:39.100
 but what's wrong about this level of 

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:41.320
 perfection 

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:43.750
 it's just laughable all the others 

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:45.970
 knives added by adding the costs 

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:47.680
 of transportation are not as expensive as 

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:49.330
 lnfs h 

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:50.740
 after reviewing all this amount of 

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:52.510
 steel what is my opinion on the 

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:54.550
 quality of these tools is good 

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:56.710
 very simple is not about what it can 

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:58.930
 make the knife or the steel it's about 

00:05:56.710 --> 00:06:00.790
 what you can do with your knife 

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:02.830
 for most people it will be 

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:04.990
 Difficult to notice the difference in performance 

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:07.510
 between one and the other for me the decision 

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:09.610
 should be based on the capabilities 

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:11.920
 of performance of the tool that can 

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:13.930
 extract you but let's be honest as 

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:16.930
 in any other product there is a value 

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:19.330
 very strong intrinsic in the competition 

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:21.370
 and know that it is possible to do something with a 

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:24.010
 knife that will not be possible with another 

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:26.020
 represents many satisfactions for the 

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:27.910
 owner do not forget to leave your 

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:30.600
 Comment below and share this video 

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:30.600
 Thank you
