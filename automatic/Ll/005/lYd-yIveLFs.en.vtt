00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:11.410
 hello youtube friends how are you 

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:14.049
 I'm sub 96 did not throw us to 96 I'm 

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:16.600
 I'm nothing else on the 26th because there was not 

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:18.490
 only space for a son who is 

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:21.310
 busy and the worst is that guy who has 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:23.470
 about his vast channel does not upload videos like this 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:27.500
 that if you type you back you 're 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:30.520
 watching without anything good 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.520
 in this video 

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:36.170
 it's a reaction video 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:39.560
 from my new captor who came by 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:42.329
 part of films already 

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:46.540
 and think 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:51.620
 good the most by the capture of the furnace 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:53.780
 there's the box that weird is open 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:57.129
 I'm sorry, I can not make a video 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:01:00.890
 reaction as you wanted because because 

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:03.019
 I arrived at night expecting to record 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:05.350
 when I opened the capturing and all that 

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:05.350
 but 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:11.640
 my camera did not have a pillar until 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.980
 invited a friend then up to date 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.430
 next that they believe was recording the 

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:18.860
 video but 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:21.500
 my camera also turned off so I did not 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:23.360
 I could resist and connect everything and I was 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:26.200
 doing tests so better just 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:28.960
 let's see who had the box 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:31.259
 is a little sick I'm going to infect you 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:31.259
 everyone 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:37.690
 look 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:41.130
 this is the capture box 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:44.009
 He gives me many cures because he does not want 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:47.789
 my hamster lived his field record was 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:50.110
 called ice cube elvis or 'the vision and I 

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:52.330
 It gives a lot of healing because it says 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:55.560
 perfect for the new generation xbox 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:55.560
 one and playstation 4 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:02.170
 and also cool 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:06.040
 it is such an elegant box that is 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:12.100
 then here I push it I remove this 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:12.100
 open and it's even smarter 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:24.350
 and here come two papers 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:24.350
 the many own just a few 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:31.390
 in that boy because it 's that such a majority 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:34.690
 It is very simple how to use it and something 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:35.950
 interesting that you notice is that it comes as 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:40.530
 if it was the menu between a game 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:40.530
 explain and start 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:47.810
 Step 1 Step 2 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.989
 to play 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:54.020
 on that side receiving side came the 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:55.780
 cables has the capture activan 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:57.640
 stable 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:01.120
 investigate these cables are from 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:03.850
 playstation3 because I do not know what subject 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:06.940
 I think it can be hdmi I think it's 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:10.510
 implement this 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:13.320
 well maybe I really wanted a 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:13.320
 station 3 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:20.090
 you will be thinking why 

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:22.280
 fucking I'm watching this video and I 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:23.810
 I do not know why they 're seeing it today that I 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:26.270
 forced to do it 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:28.270
 and the catcher is on this side 

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:32.170
 they come 

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:35.350
 it's not so elegant it 's too 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:38.800
 elegance for me once and that's it 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:42.550
 so look you can see me you're going to 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:45.340
 touch me if you touch me good you know the 

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:47.620
 mafia I am the mafia 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:51.640
 know these two rumors of people who 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:54.730
 it happens for a union with the mafia I 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:56.470
 I make these rumors happen and it's general 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:59.560
 just watch it 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:01.420
 so I wanted to name it and I have 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:03.850
 a strange hobby with naming 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:06.380
 my things and some of the strange ones 

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:09.920
 example the other hamster the hamster 

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:11.840
 that my girlfriend has is called cute 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:14.990
 dweller of darkness she loved him 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:17.330
 put in the snow or something 

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:20.180
 then cuter option dweller 

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:21.470
 the darkness she says morita to me 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:23.090
 I want it 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:25.250
 x then I wanted to name the 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:27.810

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:34.980
 the cat tons then the cat already 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:39.210
 I commented then this has been my life 

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:41.550

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:46.020

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:02.460

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:02.460

00:05:46.779 --> 00:05:51.909
 supposed reaction that said by god 

00:05:49.779 --> 00:05:53.379
