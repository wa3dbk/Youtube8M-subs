00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:39.520 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:46.880 

you<00:01:40.520> know<00:01:40.549> miss<00:01:41.329> around<00:01:41.539> the<00:01:41.689> size<00:01:41.869> their<00:01:42.259> shop

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.740 

overall<00:01:47.790> it's<00:01:47.940> a<00:01:48.090> pretty<00:01:49.520> nice<00:01:50.520> case<00:01:51.330> if<00:01:51.690> you

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
overall it's a pretty nice case if you

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.020 
overall it's a pretty nice case if you
don't<00:01:51.960> want<00:01:52.080> to<00:01:52.140> have<00:01:52.430> just<00:01:53.430> the<00:01:53.580> extended

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
don't want to have just the extended

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.160 
don't want to have just the extended
battery<00:01:54.060> on<00:01:54.540> and<00:01:54.780> then<00:01:54.870> there's<00:01:55.080> no

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
battery on and then there's no

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.120 
battery on and then there's no
protection<00:01:55.500> around<00:01:55.680> the<00:01:55.890> sides<00:01:56.130> so<00:01:58.130> that's

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
protection around the sides so that's

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.710 
protection around the sides so that's
basically<00:01:59.280> it<00:01:59.610> nothing<00:02:00.030> really<00:02:00.210> fancy<00:02:00.390> about

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:00.720 
basically it nothing really fancy about

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.320 
basically it nothing really fancy about
this<00:02:00.930> case<00:02:01.250> you<00:02:02.250> know<00:02:02.340> SS<00:02:02.670> parent<00:02:02.970> comes<00:02:03.119> out

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:03.330 
this case you know SS parent comes out

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:07.070 
this case you know SS parent comes out
pretty<00:02:03.960> quick<00:02:04.369> pretty<00:02:05.369> easily<00:02:05.810> the<00:02:06.810> palms

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:07.080 
pretty quick pretty easily the palms

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:10.460 
pretty quick pretty easily the palms
with<00:02:07.229> that<00:02:08.780> then<00:02:09.780> everything<00:02:10.110> else<00:02:10.200> works

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
with that then everything else works

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:17.400 
with that then everything else works
fine<00:02:10.679> so<00:02:11.870> so<00:02:12.870> personally<00:02:13.470> um

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:20.160 

day<00:02:18.040> goes<00:02:18.280> right<00:02:18.490> there<00:02:18.900> when<00:02:19.900> it<00:02:19.960> shows<00:02:20.140> a

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
day goes right there when it shows a

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.920

there's a flame around that once you go
you<00:02:27.650> do<00:02:27.859> this<00:02:28.010> for<00:02:28.129> a<00:02:28.159> little<00:02:28.280> bit<00:02:28.459> it'll<00:02:29.390> just

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
you do this for a little bit it'll just

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:33.429 
you do this for a little bit it'll just
get<00:02:29.870> accustomed<00:02:30.109> to<00:02:30.170> the<00:02:30.530> case<00:02:30.739> so<00:02:32.439> there's

00:02:33.429 --> 00:02:33.439 
get accustomed to the case so there's

00:02:33.439 --> 00:02:35.410 
get accustomed to the case so there's
only<00:02:33.650> two<00:02:33.799> plant<00:02:34.010> with<00:02:34.129> this<00:02:34.280> case<00:02:34.849> outside<00:02:35.150> of
