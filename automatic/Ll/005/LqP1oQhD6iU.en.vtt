 an algorithm is so your movements that reversed bracelet amount of times 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.060
 the coolo arise 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.460
 or what is going to be one that is very simple

 and 6 

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:32.569
 even explain what orientation is 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:34.869
 and the alignments 

00:02:34.869 --> 00:02:37.579
 sales are 

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:40.579

 they are already well oriented 

00:02:45.969 --> 00:02:47.559
 but if I do 

00:02:47.559 --> 00:02:50.049
 on the mobile uvi in ​​theaters 

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:51.429
 this china

 it's okay 40 

00:03:03.759 --> 00:03:06.619
 maybe what the elimination 

00:03:06.619 --> 00:03:09.189
 the investment 

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:11.089

 the cement to introduce me to lines 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.649
 that's why they are where they should 

00:03:18.649 --> 00:03:19.979
 if I 

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:21.749
 this movement 

00:03:21.749 --> 00:03:23.639
 that simple 

00:03:23.639 --> 00:03:25.219
 p teresa

 because it stresses you 

00:03:29.839 --> 00:03:31.849
 I arrived here 

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:33.999
 if I do that 

00:03:33.999 --> 00:03:36.339
 this time aa is in the line 

00:03:36.339 --> 00:03:39.339
 We are with you because this appointment 

00:03:42.009 --> 00:03:44.430
 with that basic concept I should start 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:47.819
 for that the correct century of revolver 

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:50.809
 altidore 

00:03:50.809 --> 00:03:52.889
 after the most simple harassment 

00:03:52.889 --> 00:03:55.609
 Oman the white house 

00:03:55.609 --> 00:03:57.489
 Face up 

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:00.489
 now they continue to know values ​​of face 

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:03.039
 It is the center 

00:04:03.039 --> 00:04:06.279
 because it does not matter the master I love 

00:04:06.279 --> 00:04:09.519
 that piece always shea carey 

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:13.129
 it does not seem to be now you have to be the previous broadcast of the quota 

00:04:15.669 --> 00:04:17.239
 like pete sampras white 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:19.370
 all this load 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:20.590
 like this super red 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:22.210
 3rd red 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:25.569
 Cooke Santamaría actor to see several 

00:04:25.569 --> 00:04:27.639
 portoviejo 

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:30.009
 in which the term to solve curovic 

00:04:30.009 --> 00:04:31.480
 this will be a cross 

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:34.180
 very much a couple 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:35.180
 so 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:38.180
 love that you look for one of these four that run without abuse 

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:42.360
 we look for a 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:45.360
 this expert highlighted as sex-shops 

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:48.529
 it's a list 

00:04:48.529 --> 00:04:50.849
 ideological 

00:04:50.849 --> 00:04:52.620
 then this is 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:53.539
 White 

00:04:53.539 --> 00:04:55.180
 my baby 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:57.189
 White 

00:04:57.189 --> 00:04:58.740
 it will 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:00.449
 that is, this table 

00:05:00.449 --> 00:05:03.009
 cows 

00:05:03.009 --> 00:05:04.620
 collaborated mail 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:05.969
 first you have to join 

00:05:05.969 --> 00:05:07.419
 this table 

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:10.419
 in the face dent 

00:05:11.009 --> 00:05:14.360
 we'll see below yondelis osaka 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:17.080
 2 was already down 

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:20.129
 good the drop of nectar 

00:05:20.129 --> 00:05:22.919
 i have stopped pressing 

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:25.919
 and I would say no 

00:05:27.809 --> 00:05:31.020
 possibly they are against the feel and they are 

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:32.529
 find the piece 

00:05:32.529 --> 00:05:34.490
 it's blue white 

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:36.400
 they have her face 

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:39.520
 account traveled of nectar here 

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:41.919
 own agrarian 

00:05:41.919 --> 00:05:44.919
 the center of 6 

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:49.710
 to be able to solve this 

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:52.710
 have to therefore be a uvi mobile 

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:56.360
 people stuck 

00:05:57.099 --> 00:05:58.669
 jean rammed 

00:05:58.669 --> 00:06:01.689
 full stuffed 

00:06:01.689 --> 00:06:04.689
 to be in orienting 

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:07.889
 they followed melo instructions 

00:06:07.889 --> 00:06:09.869
 I should be able to 

00:06:09.869 --> 00:06:11.309
 this course 

00:06:11.309 --> 00:06:13.419
 if they change 

00:06:13.419 --> 00:06:16.529
 candace realize that these colors 

00:06:16.529 --> 00:06:18.469
 they are well done 

00:06:18.469 --> 00:06:20.150
 for what follows 

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:23.150
 expose the corner 

00:06:23.719 --> 00:06:26.219
 then in a corner 

00:06:26.219 --> 00:06:29.219
 he took the white corner 

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:35.139
 this glass 

00:06:35.139 --> 00:06:36.339
 It's similar 

00:06:36.339 --> 00:06:37.919
 villages the act 

00:06:37.919 --> 00:06:40.789
 that he has to find the piece 

00:06:40.789 --> 00:06:42.419
 they put the pava john benestar 

00:06:42.419 --> 00:06:44.080
 this case and down 

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:47.080
 to do the cousin that teaches you at the beginning 

00:06:47.909 --> 00:06:49.089
 who lashed out 

00:06:49.089 --> 00:06:52.529
 Was inverted 

00:06:52.529 --> 00:06:55.529
 ec sts algorithm so far that 

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:07.749
 half 

00:07:07.749 --> 00:07:11.089
 let's say that he pampered answered quesada 

00:07:11.089 --> 00:07:12.469
 Kirkham state 

00:07:12.469 --> 00:07:13.350
 the team 

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:16.350
 so alternates lucas the algorithm until it's all right 

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:27.209
 you have to go
