the ring gear for oil I think which is
kind<00:00:29.970> of<00:00:30.000> nice

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.510 
but I'm gonna be doing the same thing
like<00:00:40.110> I<00:00:40.200> did<00:00:40.350> with<00:00:40.469> the<00:00:40.559> other<00:00:40.710> one<00:00:40.800> the<00:00:41.160> first

like I did with the other one the first

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:42.799 
like I did with the other one the first
video<00:00:41.879> they'll<00:00:42.090> be<00:00:42.180> pulling<00:00:42.360> the<00:00:42.510> axle

cleaning everything out and this stuff

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.170

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
should wipe out pretty easy because it's

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.869 
should wipe out pretty easy because it's
very<00:00:48.420> oily<00:00:48.739> so<00:00:49.739> that<00:00:50.250> should<00:00:50.460> come<00:00:50.730> out<00:00:50.760> pretty

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
very oily so that should come out pretty

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:51.850 
very oily so that should come out pretty

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.700 
still has the brake drums and it has
good<00:00:59.940> axles<00:01:00.449> lot<00:01:00.600> from<00:01:00.780> what<00:01:00.960> I<00:01:00.989> know<00:01:01.109> of<00:01:01.260> so

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
good axles lot from what I know of so

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.130 
good axles lot from what I know of so
what<00:01:02.550> saved<00:01:02.789> me<00:01:02.940> from<00:01:03.059> having<00:01:03.149> to<00:01:03.480> look<00:01:03.899> around

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
what saved me from having to look around

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.010 
what saved me from having to look around
for<00:01:04.320> axles<00:01:04.739> again<00:01:05.510> so<00:01:06.510> that's<00:01:06.659> one<00:01:06.869> of<00:01:06.900> the

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
for axles again so that's one of the

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.410 
for axles again so that's one of the
ones<00:01:07.260> this<00:01:07.409> is<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.590> better<00:01:07.830> of<00:01:07.920> the<00:01:08.010> two<00:01:08.420> the

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
ones this is the better of the two the

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.060 
ones this is the better of the two the
other<00:01:09.570> one<00:01:09.689> I<00:01:09.750> have<00:01:09.780> out<00:01:10.110> here<00:01:10.409> underneath<00:01:10.799> the

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
other one I have out here underneath the

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:17.359 
other one I have out here underneath the
bench<00:01:14.570> and<00:01:15.570> this<00:01:15.990> one<00:01:16.290> was<00:01:16.740> the<00:01:16.770> worst<00:01:17.100> of<00:01:17.280> the

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
bench and this one was the worst of the

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.539 
bench and this one was the worst of the
two<00:01:17.580> for<00:01:18.150> being<00:01:18.570> clean<00:01:18.869> on<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.140> inside<00:01:19.520> got<00:01:20.520> a

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
two for being clean on the inside got a

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.420 
two for being clean on the inside got a
lot<00:01:20.759> of<00:01:20.790> rust<00:01:21.119> on<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:21.420> top<00:01:21.630> there<00:01:22.040> and<00:01:23.040> down

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
lot of rust on the top there and down

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.350 
lot of rust on the top there and down
the<00:01:23.580> bottom<00:01:25.040> got<00:01:26.040> a<00:01:26.100> lot<00:01:26.310> of<00:01:26.340> goop<00:01:26.610> and<00:01:26.850> stuff<00:01:27.119> I

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
the bottom got a lot of goop and stuff I

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.300 
the bottom got a lot of goop and stuff I
ended<00:01:27.840> up<00:01:27.900> pulling<00:01:28.140> that<00:01:28.409> out<00:01:28.619> of<00:01:28.770> it<00:01:28.860> earlier

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
ended up pulling that out of it earlier

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.090 
ended up pulling that out of it earlier
so<00:01:29.780> that's<00:01:30.780> gonna<00:01:31.020> take<00:01:31.200> a<00:01:31.229> lot<00:01:31.409> more<00:01:31.470> cleaning

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
so that's gonna take a lot more cleaning

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.590 
so that's gonna take a lot more cleaning
let's<00:01:32.369> get<00:01:32.549> a<00:01:32.579> little<00:01:32.790> more<00:01:33.030> rust<00:01:33.329> on<00:01:33.479> the

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
let's get a little more rust on the

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:39.140 
let's get a little more rust on the
outside<00:01:33.990> same<00:01:34.380> deal<00:01:35.150> brake<00:01:36.150> drums<00:01:36.479> hubs<00:01:38.150> it's

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
outside same deal brake drums hubs it's

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.590 
outside same deal brake drums hubs it's
also<00:01:39.270> got<00:01:39.479> the<00:01:39.570> PTO<00:01:39.900> plate<00:01:40.259> on<00:01:40.409> the<00:01:40.470> front<00:01:41.600> so

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
also got the PTO plate on the front so

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.539

this one will not be will not be getting
used<00:01:44.909> on<00:01:45.240> the<00:01:45.810> build<00:01:46.049> I'm<00:01:46.920> gonna<00:01:47.130> be<00:01:47.280> using

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:47.479 
used on the build I'm gonna be using

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:50.270 
used on the build I'm gonna be using
this<00:01:48.479> one<00:01:48.720> in<00:01:48.840> here<00:01:49.110> and<00:01:49.470> this<00:01:49.920> one<00:01:50.130> that<00:01:50.220> I

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
this one in here and this one that I

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.609 
this one in here and this one that I
have<00:01:50.369> up<00:01:50.700> here<00:01:50.939> on<00:01:51.000> the<00:01:51.149> shed<00:01:51.390> and<00:01:52.140> this<00:01:52.320> is<00:01:52.470> one

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
have up here on the shed and this is one

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.550 
have up here on the shed and this is one
of<00:01:52.649> my<00:01:52.829> yellow<00:01:53.009> ones<00:01:53.280> here<00:01:53.659> and<00:01:54.659> reason<00:01:55.380> being

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
of my yellow ones here and reason being

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.590 
of my yellow ones here and reason being
is<00:01:55.770> that<00:01:56.040> this<00:01:56.579> one<00:01:56.820> and<00:01:57.000> the<00:01:57.090> other<00:01:57.210> red<00:01:57.420> one

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
is that this one and the other red one

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.209 
is that this one and the other red one
are<00:01:57.689> both<00:01:57.840> the<00:01:58.049> cleanest<00:01:58.500> have<00:01:58.710> the<00:01:58.979> floor

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
are both the cleanest have the floor

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.219 
are both the cleanest have the floor
that<00:01:59.369> I<00:01:59.399> have<00:01:59.670> and<00:02:00.600> I'm<00:02:00.689> probably<00:02:00.840> gonna<00:02:01.049> leave

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
that I have and I'm probably gonna leave

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.830 
that I have and I'm probably gonna leave
the<00:02:01.350> least<00:02:01.560> amount<00:02:01.829> of<00:02:01.950> work<00:02:02.159> so<00:02:02.610> I<00:02:02.880> don't<00:02:03.719> know

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
the least amount of work so I don't know

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.440 
the least amount of work so I don't know
how<00:02:03.960> well<00:02:04.110> you<00:02:04.140> can<00:02:04.320> see<00:02:04.560> it<00:02:04.590> but<00:02:04.969> you<00:02:05.969> only

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
how well you can see it but you only

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.150 
how well you can see it but you only
really<00:02:06.600> Kansas<00:02:07.140> the<00:02:07.259> planet<00:02:07.590> areas<00:02:07.860> are<00:02:07.979> still

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
really Kansas the planet areas are still

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.400 
really Kansas the planet areas are still
in<00:02:08.310> there<00:02:08.489> but<00:02:08.700> it<00:02:09.239> is<00:02:09.420> fairly<00:02:09.720> clean<00:02:10.050> inside

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
in there but it is fairly clean inside

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.610 
in there but it is fairly clean inside
it's<00:02:10.619> about<00:02:10.830> like<00:02:11.039> the<00:02:11.220> red<00:02:11.400> one

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
it's about like the red one

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.199 
it's about like the red one
so<00:02:12.800> let's<00:02:12.950> get<00:02:13.129> the<00:02:13.250> same<00:02:13.489> treatment<00:02:13.790> with

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:14.209 
so let's get the same treatment with

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:16.000 
so let's get the same treatment with
getting<00:02:14.510> the<00:02:14.599> axle<00:02:14.959> housings<00:02:15.319> off<00:02:15.500> three

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
getting the axle housings off three

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:17.910 
getting the axle housings off three
gasketed<00:02:16.580> and<00:02:16.700> everything<00:02:17.150> obviously

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
gasketed and everything obviously

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.350 
gasketed and everything obviously
already<00:02:18.920> wash<00:02:19.250> this<00:02:19.519> one<00:02:19.760> so<00:02:19.940> it's<00:02:20.090> ready<00:02:20.300> to

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
already wash this one so it's ready to

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.839 
already wash this one so it's ready to
go<00:02:20.510> on<00:02:20.599> the<00:02:20.810> outside<00:02:21.160> nice<00:02:22.160> and<00:02:22.370> clean

00:02:22.839 --> 00:02:22.849 
go on the outside nice and clean

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:25.000 
go on the outside nice and clean
still<00:02:23.450> as<00:02:23.540> a<00:02:23.629> PTO<00:02:23.930> played<00:02:24.290> out<00:02:24.440> and<00:02:24.590> everything

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
still as a PTO played out and everything

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:30.100 
still as a PTO played out and everything
and<00:02:25.340> these<00:02:26.150> axles<00:02:26.599> were<00:02:26.720> still<00:02:27.019> good<00:02:28.959> the<00:02:29.959> only

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
and these axles were still good the only

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:32.589 
and these axles were still good the only
problem<00:02:30.590> was<00:02:30.680> a<00:02:30.739> little<00:02:31.040> ding<00:02:31.280> in<00:02:31.519> the<00:02:32.090> keyway

00:02:32.589 --> 00:02:32.599 
problem was a little ding in the keyway

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:34.270 
problem was a little ding in the keyway
right<00:02:32.870> there<00:02:33.110> which<00:02:33.319> isn't<00:02:33.470> really<00:02:33.620> too<00:02:34.069> big

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
right there which isn't really too big

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.520 
right there which isn't really too big
of<00:02:34.370> a<00:02:34.459> deal<00:02:34.720> and<00:02:35.720> I<00:02:35.870> already<00:02:36.080> pulled<00:02:36.290> the<00:02:36.379> other

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
of a deal and I already pulled the other

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:38.710 
of a deal and I already pulled the other
hub<00:02:36.769> off<00:02:36.980> earlier<00:02:37.489> and<00:02:38.060> it's<00:02:38.330> still<00:02:38.569> really

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
hub off earlier and it's still really

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:41.170 
hub off earlier and it's still really
good<00:02:38.930> on<00:02:39.080> that<00:02:39.290> side<00:02:39.530> also<00:02:39.739> so<00:02:40.340> got<00:02:41.000> a<00:02:41.030> good

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
good on that side also so got a good

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.720 
good on that side also so got a good
transmission<00:02:41.840> here<00:02:42.140> and<00:02:42.430> this<00:02:43.430> one<00:02:43.580> is<00:02:43.700> a

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730 
transmission here and this one is a

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:44.949 
transmission here and this one is a
little<00:02:44.000> older<00:02:44.269> than<00:02:44.390> the<00:02:44.450> other<00:02:44.569> one

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:44.959 
little older than the other one

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:46.420 
little older than the other one
not<00:02:45.170> that<00:02:45.290> it<00:02:45.380> really<00:02:45.410> matters<00:02:45.620> by<00:02:46.099> a<00:02:46.130> couple

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
not that it really matters by a couple

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:48.880 
not that it really matters by a couple
years<00:02:46.780> whereas<00:02:47.780> on<00:02:47.959> that<00:02:48.110> one<00:02:48.349> he<00:02:48.590> saw<00:02:48.829> the

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
years whereas on that one he saw the

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:51.190 
years whereas on that one he saw the
brass<00:02:49.340> ring<00:02:49.640> gear<00:02:50.000> this<00:02:50.329> one<00:02:50.510> has<00:02:50.660> a<00:02:50.690> solid

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
brass ring gear this one has a solid

brass ring gear without the cutouts on
the<00:02:53.660> side<00:02:53.930> of<00:02:53.959> it<00:02:54.170> so<00:02:55.360> it's<00:02:56.360> also<00:02:56.480> got<00:02:56.720> a<00:02:56.750> good

and next time you see the update these
should<00:03:15.920> be<00:03:15.950> both<00:03:16.220> sitting<00:03:16.670> on<00:03:16.760> the<00:03:16.850> floor<00:03:17.030> with

wheels on them and then we can start
working<00:03:19.910> on<00:03:20.180> the<00:03:20.329> center<00:03:20.600> joint<00:03:20.870> then<00:03:21.500> it's

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:21.680 
working on the center joint then it's
