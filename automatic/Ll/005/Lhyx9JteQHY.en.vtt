00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:30.370
 cloth 

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:32.770
 I'm going to start painting with white 

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:35.560
 I will also occupy green grass and I will 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:38.620
 occupying a small brush of the number 0 is 

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:40.719
 the brand rodin and it's cat tongue 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:43.020
 I'm going to show you how we're going to paint a 

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:43.020
 petal 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:50.970
 let's apply white 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:50.970
 all the contour of the flower 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:58.699
 and then we're going to take a little bit of 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:01.969
 green grass only with the corner of 

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:04.129
 brush and we are going to chop from here of the 

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:06.259
 petal center 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:08.710
 out we're going to slide a 

00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:08.710
 bit 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:13.430
 we are going to apply a few amounts 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:16.760
 so as not to overdo it, we're going to apply 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:19.650
 here and let's go out of 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:21.750
 this way we are going to paint all 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:25.400
 the little flowers that our 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.400
 apple napkin 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:33.490
 let's paint a petal more let's 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.490
 fill everything with white 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:39.549
 these are very easy and fast 

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:39.549
 perform are tiny 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:45.550
 since we have made the target now 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:48.280
 let's apply with the corner of the 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:49.930
 brush only a little bit of green 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.760
 grammy let's work the same in the 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:54.060
 petal corner and let's pull towards 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:54.060
 outside 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.929
 in the same way we are going to work all 

00:01:56.829 --> 00:02:01.359
 the petals these petals do not carry 

00:01:58.929 --> 00:02:05.009
 a lot of work, we're just going to 

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:05.009
 paint well let's paint one more 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:10.200
 the whole base with white 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:25.160
 once again with the pure corner of 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:28.250
 brush let's take a pinch of green 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:30.160
 and we are going to apply from here to 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:32.080
 outside 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:35.620
 we are only going to apply little 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:39.160
 quantities of green grass paint what 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:41.260
 others will gray out a little because 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:43.510
 we have the petals ready as we have 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:46.610
 finished the flower we will work with 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:49.080
 yellow change that is this yellow 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:51.390
 center 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:53.400
 of the little flower 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:56.750
 let's paint the entire center of the flower 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.750
 with this yellow cadmium 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:06.730
 and also working with the brush 

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:08.770
 little thing we have for these are 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:10.420
 flowers or very small works 

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:13.150
 I always recommend using a brush 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:17.250
 tiny to not get out of the margin 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:17.250
 who sends us the work or the figure 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:21.710
 always the hand should have a brush 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:24.710
 from number 6 

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:26.540
 of number 4 of 2 and 0 and also a 

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:28.819
 line 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:31.370
 since I have finished the center now 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:33.650
 with a brown that is this brown tone 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:36.310
 Of course you are going to work with everyone 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:38.980
 the similar ones if they do not have this 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:41.170
 we go 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:43.020
 being in the middle part as average 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:45.540
 moon nothing more 

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:46.910
 we make half moon and we blur it very 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:50.870
 all right 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:53.780
 now we are going to occupy a bit of white 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:55.959
 and we are going to apply in this part of here 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:55.959
 down 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:01.900
 up here we are also going to apply a 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:04.890
 bit 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:04.890
 in white 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:11.260
 only very little again I take a 

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:14.280
 a little more brown to touch up here 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.280
 where I marked the crescent 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:21.000
 and so I 'm going to do it I'm going to finish 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.950
 do all the flower once we have 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.770
 made all the flowers we are going to 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:27.690
 make these little leaves for 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:29.490
 this I'm going to occupy lemon yellow that was 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:32.940
 the one that occupies for the large leaves and 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:34.620
 green moss we will continue to use the 

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:39.980
 tiny brush from scratch that I'm 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:39.980
 occupying let's paint a leaf all 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:48.060
 the part here that has a little 

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:48.060
 flatter this part with green moss 

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:55.450
 and we are going to blur very well here 

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:58.620
 we are going to mark well the little bank and 

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:58.620
 we blur up here 

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:05.660
 let's take a little paint of the 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:10.480
 same as I am occupying 

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:10.480
 and I'm going to mark the rib of the sheet 

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:17.390
 since I have it ready without rinsing my 

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:19.100
 brush I will take lemon yellow and with 

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:21.200
 this evil lemon I 'm also going to give light 

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:23.650
 to this little sheet but only one 

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:23.650
 extreme 

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:31.280
 on this side and it diffuses very well for 

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:31.280
 merge with everything else moss green 

00:05:31.529 --> 00:05:36.839
 names city what fits us very well 

00:05:33.749 --> 00:05:38.930
 on the small bank marked the yellow for 

00:05:36.839 --> 00:05:41.660
 that you get to see comes out 

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:43.840
 so let's paint another little drop 

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:43.840
 plus 

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:47.750
 mixed here knowing local 

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:52.449
 and I'm going to work this part of here with 

00:05:50.319 --> 00:05:54.639
 Moss green 

00:05:52.449 --> 00:05:56.650
 and the rest blurred it to this side 

00:05:54.639 --> 00:05:59.439
 because remember that there we are going to put 

00:05:56.650 --> 00:06:02.480
 a lighter shade without rinsing the brush 

00:05:59.439 --> 00:06:05.540
 I'm taking lemon yellow again 

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:08.980
 and I'm going to apply here on top of the 

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:08.980
 sheet down 

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:15.530
 from here downwards giving movements 

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:15.530
 circular 

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:25.490
 to melt the tones very well with each other 

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:27.500
 and that will give us a light that is going 

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:29.870
 to give a little leaf with light although it is 

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:32.060
 little girl but 

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:33.680
 we will also have light and shade in 

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:36.080
 she 

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:37.880
 once again this little leaf I'm going to paint 

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:42.639
 in the part of here all with green moss 

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:42.639
 and diffused very well towards this extreme 

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:49.550
 without washing my brush 

00:06:45.569 --> 00:06:49.550
 I'm taking food yellow again 

00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:54.140
 and I'll put in the part here 

00:06:56.030 --> 00:07:01.810
 there are not many tasks that these 

00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:01.810
 tiny leaves so they can work 

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:07.400
 to join the tones together 

00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:17.300
 and in this way we are going to make all 

00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:19.730
 the leaves the ribs we are going to 

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:21.290
 do the same with green moss good girlfriends
