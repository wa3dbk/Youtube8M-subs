00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:03.750
 hello dear friends gardeners and 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.690
 gardeners 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:09.059
 the weather does not spoil us of the Moscow region 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.679
 that frost the rain in the garden is not 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:12.210
 you will get nothing 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.480
 just a ship 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:17.730
 but I want you to have time to tell everything 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.539
 so that you still use my 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.660
 tips 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.699
 Let me now the pilot asked me a question 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.580
 question yulia here I have a grade 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:29.789
 gooseberry I like it very much 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:32.700
 you can multiply gooseberries as much as possible 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:35.399
 propagate it can be gooseberry without 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.590
 spikes circling the mixer with spikes it can 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.960
 be yes then it may be red 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.480
 currants this already to black currants 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.690
 now it's not too late because 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:48.590
 that the branches are still bending well now and 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:52.710
 can we make rooting bushes 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:57.469
 look mindful i did i 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.469
 dug up just such a small groove and 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:03.960
 prepared a bucket of money and for 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:06.510
 rooting the bush I cooked this 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:09.299
 here's a stud look carefully here 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:12.270
 such hooks are sold wick in fixed price 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:15.570
 they are very very comfortable I advise you 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.970
 buy exactly for rooting plants 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.580
 for aiming you can pin 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.290
 Now the most pure rose and the next year 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.439
 you will have a very good 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.600
 stalk with the roots of the same rink 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:31.619
 currant we can pin as with 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:35.009
 catching here look carefully aha i 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:38.180
 look here this one here this branch we 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:41.220
 take one branch look carefully 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:44.310
 he thorny bends well and can 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:47.000
 step foot now is not scary you 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:49.710
 I drove it down in this groove 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:54.480
 look carefully what i do i 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:59.490
 I take this hairpin here and 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:02:03.930
 I just now just so press 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:07.530
 look in the ground i can take it 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:10.170
 do it very well see it is convenient 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:12.750
 the operation is not terrible for him that is 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:16.200
 That's how we took and at the spire or here 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:19.590
 this is our gooseberry bush look what 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:24.750
 i will do next i take the fertile 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:27.140
 ground or humus and fall asleep place 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.140
 cutting down 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:40.020
 did backfill here look here so 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:43.470
 eat next year the next not in 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:46.880
 this year, and next year it will acquire 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:51.540
 very good roots good root 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:55.080
 system and we are just with you what 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:58.709
 do we take here and shears 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:59.910
 pruning shears this stalk from 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:02.190
 main bush 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:03.120
 that is, we can propagate so 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:06.540
 gooseberry 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:09.900
 currant black red white currant 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:13.350
 it may be yoshta it may be 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:16.380
 studless gooseberry and climbing rose 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:19.430
 Here perhaps such a small tip I 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:23.010
 I wanted to give you exactly rooting 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:24.540
 because we are giving me a question and I 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:27.390
 I want to tell you 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:29.400
 many know here they write what's what you 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:32.959
 chew that you say the same thing 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:35.250
 but still let's not forget about those 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:39.090
 let's not forget about those who only 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:41.340
 begins to engage in a difficult garden 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:43.800
 labor then it will be possible in another 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:46.500
 father's place of course it seems that we are from 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:49.770
 and we will transplant the next year 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:53.130
 wherever you want it is 

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:55.100
 so you can have this bush and not even 

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:58.130
 root 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:04:00.020
 and one is not one but several so 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:02.840
 offsets you can do yes how many 

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:05.750
 anything you know even a little bit here 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:07.520
 distract my mother-in-law 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:10.610
 once when we didnâ€™t come too 

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:13.430
 in the spring she did such an operation I 

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:16.180
 think too what she does she just 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:19.550
 just fit the gooseberry bush and 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:22.760
 kicking dug it around and kicking like 

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:25.580
 if she had these branches too, I trampled to sleep 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:28.430
 ground and in general taste turned out 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:30.650
 big strong powerful and you are not 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:32.060
 Can you imagine what a rich harvest was 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:34.760
 always gooseberry 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:37.580
 I honestly tell you, I haven't tried this and 

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:38.900
 I do not know here perch and that's it 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:41.960
 in such a way 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:42.680
 Well this concludes my such 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:46.010
 reportage 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:48.140
 and in general, the advice in such small with 

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:50.240
 you were as always yulia me him 

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:52.490
 his channel in the garden whether in the garden 

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:55.460
 maybe you still liked it and 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:59.300
 here is such a method of rooting put huskies 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:05:02.260
 ask questions until we meet again 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:02.260
 bye bye
