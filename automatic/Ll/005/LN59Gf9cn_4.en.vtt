00:00:41.789 --> 00:00:44.540 
there's gonna be a small group of elites
doing<00:00:42.390> everything<00:00:42.570> right<00:00:42.840> and<00:00:43.050> then<00:00:43.550> 45,000

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
doing everything right and then 45,000

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.639 
doing everything right and then 45,000
varieties<00:00:44.969> are<00:00:45.149> wrong<00:00:45.420> these<00:00:46.230> guys<00:00:46.440> aren't

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
varieties are wrong these guys aren't

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.110 
varieties are wrong these guys aren't
just<00:00:46.859> faster<00:00:47.190> than<00:00:47.339> us<00:00:47.429> they're<00:00:47.789> lighter

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
just faster than us they're lighter

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.150 
just faster than us they're lighter
they're<00:00:48.449> smoother<00:00:48.960> they're<00:00:49.170> gentler<00:00:49.559> so<00:00:50.070> the

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
they're smoother they're gentler so the

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.099 
they're smoother they're gentler so the
question<00:00:50.460> is<00:00:50.609> how<00:00:50.910> is<00:00:50.940> it<00:00:51.239> those<00:00:51.719> of<00:00:51.870> us<00:00:51.960> in<00:00:52.050> the

00:00:52.099 --> 00:00:52.109 
question is how is it those of us in the

00:00:52.109 --> 00:00:53.540 
question is how is it those of us in the
back<00:00:52.260> of<00:00:52.440> the<00:00:52.500> pack<00:00:52.679> can<00:00:53.070> learn<00:00:53.190> how<00:00:53.309> to<00:00:53.339> run

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
back of the pack can learn how to run

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.340 
back of the pack can learn how to run
like<00:00:53.730> those<00:00:53.879> guys<00:00:54.089> in<00:00:54.420> the<00:00:54.539> front<00:00:54.719> of<00:00:54.839> the<00:00:54.899> pack

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
like those guys in the front of the pack

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.680 
like those guys in the front of the pack
well<00:00:55.710> back<00:00:55.859> in<00:00:55.890> 1874<00:00:56.760> this<00:00:57.089> genius<00:00:57.510> named

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
well back in 1874 this genius named

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.869 
well back in 1874 this genius named
Walter<00:00:58.140> George<00:00:58.410> developed<00:00:59.339> this<00:00:59.399> foolproof

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
Walter George developed this foolproof

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.110 
Walter George developed this foolproof
technique<00:01:00.510> to<00:01:01.170> learn<00:01:01.350> the<00:01:01.800> one<00:01:02.129> best<00:01:02.579> way<00:01:02.850> to

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
technique to learn the one best way to

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.030 
technique to learn the one best way to
run<00:01:03.510> perfectly<00:01:04.080> he<00:01:04.680> was<00:01:04.800> a<00:01:04.830> chemist

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
run perfectly he was a chemist

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.860 
run perfectly he was a chemist
apprentice<00:01:05.580> he<00:01:05.790> had<00:01:05.909> to<00:01:05.970> work<00:01:06.120> inside<00:01:06.420> 14

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:06.870 
apprentice he had to work inside 14

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:08.480 
apprentice he had to work inside 14
hours<00:01:07.140> a<00:01:07.200> day<00:01:07.290> so<00:01:07.800> you<00:01:07.890> couldn't<00:01:08.130> run<00:01:08.190> as<00:01:08.310> much

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
hours a day so you couldn't run as much

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.010 
hours a day so you couldn't run as much
as<00:01:08.670> other<00:01:08.820> people<00:01:08.850> she'd<00:01:09.540> learned<00:01:09.690> how<00:01:09.810> to<00:01:09.840> run

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
as other people she'd learned how to run

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.810 
as other people she'd learned how to run
better<00:01:10.320> and<00:01:10.680> what<00:01:11.130> he<00:01:11.220> learned<00:01:11.310> to<00:01:11.460> do<00:01:11.610> was<00:01:11.790> a

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
better and what he learned to do was a

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.700 
better and what he learned to do was a
thing<00:01:12.090> called<00:01:12.270> the<00:01:12.360> 100<00:01:12.960> up<00:01:13.110> it's<00:01:13.470> foolproof

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
thing called the 100 up it's foolproof

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.830 
thing called the 100 up it's foolproof
it's<00:01:14.250> easy<00:01:14.490> you<00:01:14.939> learn<00:01:15.240> it<00:01:15.360> and<00:01:15.479> you<00:01:15.720> will

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
it's easy you learn it and you will

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.240 
it's easy you learn it and you will
never<00:01:16.020> run<00:01:16.409> wrong<00:01:16.770> again

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
never run wrong again

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.920 
never run wrong again
so<00:01:17.759> step<00:01:17.970> one<00:01:18.149> though<00:01:18.299> is<00:01:18.479> get<00:01:18.659> rid<00:01:18.750> of<00:01:18.840> these

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
so step one though is get rid of these

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.139 
so step one though is get rid of these
things<00:01:19.590> these<00:01:19.799> things<00:01:20.040> on<00:01:20.159> your<00:01:20.250> feet<00:01:20.460> shoes

00:01:21.139 --> 00:01:21.149 
things these things on your feet shoes

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:23.480 
things these things on your feet shoes
off<00:01:21.390> got<00:01:21.659> to<00:01:21.750> be<00:01:21.810> barefoot<00:01:22.100> it<00:01:23.100> doesn't<00:01:23.340> matter

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
off got to be barefoot it doesn't matter

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.280 
off got to be barefoot it doesn't matter
how<00:01:23.610> big<00:01:23.790> the<00:01:23.880> engine<00:01:24.210> is<00:01:24.360> if<00:01:24.600> the<00:01:24.899> train<00:01:25.140> won't

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
how big the engine is if the train won't

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.050 
how big the engine is if the train won't
stay<00:01:25.560> on<00:01:25.649> the<00:01:25.740> tracks<00:01:25.979> you<00:01:26.280> have<00:01:26.549> a<00:01:26.610> big<00:01:26.759> engine

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
stay on the tracks you have a big engine

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.370 
stay on the tracks you have a big engine
the<00:01:27.149> trains<00:01:27.390> rattling<00:01:27.810> around<00:01:27.869> you're<00:01:28.290> gonna

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
the trains rattling around you're gonna

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:29.660 
the trains rattling around you're gonna
be<00:01:28.469> inefficient<00:01:28.890> and<00:01:29.280> you're<00:01:29.369> not<00:01:29.460> going<00:01:29.610> to

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
be inefficient and you're not going to

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.459 
be inefficient and you're not going to
be<00:01:29.759> smooth<00:01:30.000> so<00:01:30.570> what<00:01:30.750> he<00:01:30.930> want<00:01:31.079> to<00:01:31.140> figure<00:01:31.380> out

00:01:31.459 --> 00:01:31.469 
be smooth so what he want to figure out

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:34.160 
be smooth so what he want to figure out
is<00:01:31.799> what<00:01:32.189> is<00:01:32.490> the<00:01:32.880> lesson<00:01:33.090> of<00:01:33.360> smoothness<00:01:33.719> so

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
is what is the lesson of smoothness so

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.230 
is what is the lesson of smoothness so
the<00:01:34.619> first<00:01:34.829> thing<00:01:34.979> he<00:01:35.070> did<00:01:35.310> was<00:01:35.610> what<00:01:36.180> he

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
the first thing he did was what he

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.510 
the first thing he did was what he
called<00:01:36.270> the<00:01:36.509> minor<00:01:36.719> exercise<00:01:37.200> two<00:01:38.130> spots<00:01:38.369> on

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
called the minor exercise two spots on

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.429 
called the minor exercise two spots on
the<00:01:38.610> ground<00:01:38.729> you<00:01:39.630> stand<00:01:39.899> straight<00:01:40.200> with

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
the ground you stand straight with

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.679 
the ground you stand straight with
shoulders<00:01:40.890> over<00:01:41.130> hips<00:01:41.430> over<00:01:41.729> ankles<00:01:42.240> and<00:01:42.450> then
