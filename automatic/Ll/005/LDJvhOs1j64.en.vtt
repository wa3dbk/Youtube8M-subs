00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
really fun actually I'm surprised on how

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.390 
really fun actually I'm surprised on how
good<00:01:21.390> they've<00:01:21.600> done<00:01:21.810> it<00:01:22.439> is<00:01:22.619> a<00:01:22.650> bit<00:01:22.979> laggy<00:01:23.189> but

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
good they've done it is a bit laggy but

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.740 
good they've done it is a bit laggy but
what<00:01:23.640> can<00:01:23.759> you<00:01:23.850> expect<00:01:23.880> from<00:01:24.270> a<00:01:24.450> game<00:01:24.600> that's

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
what can you expect from a game that's

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.179 
what can you expect from a game that's
not<00:01:24.900> even<00:01:25.110> out<00:01:25.259> yet<00:01:25.290> by<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:25.740> time<00:01:26.009> this<00:01:26.130> goes

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
not even out yet by the time this goes

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.190 
not even out yet by the time this goes
up<00:01:26.549> it<00:01:26.700> probably<00:01:27.090> will<00:01:27.240> be<00:01:27.299> out<00:01:27.600> because<00:01:28.170> I

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
up it probably will be out because I

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.929 
up it probably will be out because I
don't<00:01:28.530> really<00:01:28.619> want<00:01:28.829> to<00:01:28.860> see<00:01:29.759> if<00:01:29.820> it's

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
don't really want to see if it's

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.870 
don't really want to see if it's
uploaded<00:01:30.390> date<00:01:30.840> before<00:01:31.250> even<00:01:32.250> if<00:01:32.340> it's<00:01:32.579> all

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
uploaded date before even if it's all

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.960 
uploaded date before even if it's all
good<00:01:33.119> good<00:01:33.450> I<00:01:34.070> guess<00:01:35.070> that's<00:01:35.250> that<00:01:35.400> I<00:01:35.549> just

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
good good I guess that's that I just

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.600 
good good I guess that's that I just
can't<00:01:36.150> really<00:01:36.450> believe<00:01:36.680> how<00:01:37.680> bad<00:01:37.950> I<00:01:38.250> did<00:01:38.490> it

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
can't really believe how bad I did it

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.700 
can't really believe how bad I did it
