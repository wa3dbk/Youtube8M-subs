and<00:00:35.700> tsunami<00:00:36.030> warning<00:00:36.450> system<00:00:37.230> will<00:00:37.440> have<00:00:37.620> to

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
and tsunami warning system will have to

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.979 
and tsunami warning system will have to
be<00:00:37.829> kicked<00:00:38.309> into<00:00:38.370> place<00:00:38.850> a<00:00:39.149> lot<00:00:39.719> of<00:00:39.870> these

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
be forgotten in a hurry so every day

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.899 
be forgotten in a hurry so every day
remember<00:01:04.379> just<00:01:04.619> about<00:01:04.830> two<00:01:05.339> months<00:01:05.580> ago<00:01:05.640> as

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
remember just about two months ago as

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.310 
remember just about two months ago as
much<00:01:06.060> as<00:01:06.180> there<00:01:06.330> was<00:01:06.479> an<00:01:06.630> earthquake<00:01:07.110> in<00:01:07.260> the

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
much as there was an earthquake in the

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.380 
much as there was an earthquake in the
Indian<00:01:07.470> Ocean<00:01:07.979> as<00:01:08.130> well<00:01:08.369> are<00:01:08.640> just<00:01:09.090> off<00:01:09.270> the

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
Indian Ocean as well are just off the

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.030 
Indian Ocean as well are just off the
coast<00:01:09.510> of<00:01:09.720> Indonesia<00:01:09.930> at<00:01:10.320> that<00:01:10.530> time<00:01:10.680> they<00:01:10.830> had

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
coast of Indonesia at that time they had

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.010 
coast of Indonesia at that time they had
been<00:01:11.070> a<00:01:11.430> similar<00:01:11.820> tsunami<00:01:12.119> warning<00:01:12.570> even

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
been a similar tsunami warning even

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.630 
been a similar tsunami warning even
though<00:01:13.140> ultimately<00:01:13.260> there<00:01:13.860> wasn't<00:01:14.250> a<00:01:14.340> tsunami

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
though ultimately there wasn't a tsunami

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.370 
though ultimately there wasn't a tsunami
that<00:01:15.150> each<00:01:15.330> time<00:01:15.600> an<00:01:15.720> earthquake<00:01:16.049> of<00:01:16.229> this

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
that each time an earthquake of this

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.260 
that each time an earthquake of this
kind<00:01:16.619> happens<00:01:17.100> it's<00:01:17.430> very<00:01:17.700> difficult<00:01:18.150> to

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
kind happens it's very difficult to

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.330 
kind happens it's very difficult to
actually<00:01:18.450> predict<00:01:18.960> whether<00:01:19.290> the<00:01:19.619> destructive

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
actually predict whether the destructive

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.520 
actually predict whether the destructive
forces<00:01:20.670> that<00:01:20.939> that<00:01:21.570> has<00:01:21.689> been<00:01:21.869> unleashed<00:01:22.290> in

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
forces that that has been unleashed in

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.080 
forces that that has been unleashed in
terms<00:01:22.710> of<00:01:22.890> the<00:01:23.009> kind<00:01:23.189> of<00:01:23.280> tsunami<00:01:23.520> they

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
terms of the kind of tsunami they

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.149 
terms of the kind of tsunami they
unleash<00:01:24.450> are<00:01:24.780> very<00:01:24.960> difficult<00:01:25.350> to<00:01:25.409> predict

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
unleash are very difficult to predict

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.310 
unleash are very difficult to predict
given<00:01:26.670> the<00:01:26.909> kind<00:01:27.090> of<00:01:27.210> systems<00:01:27.540> that<00:01:27.780> you<00:01:28.229> know

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
given the kind of systems that you know

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.140 
given the kind of systems that you know
scientists<00:01:28.799> and<00:01:28.920> geologists<00:01:29.400> have<00:01:29.549> at<00:01:29.820> this

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
scientists and geologists have at this

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.330 
scientists and geologists have at this
particular<00:01:30.329> time<00:01:30.840> which<00:01:31.140> is<00:01:31.290> simply<00:01:31.650> why<00:01:31.860> when

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
particular time which is simply why when

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.039 
particular time which is simply why when
the<00:01:32.520> tsunami<00:01:32.700> warnings<00:01:33.299> actually<00:01:33.689> kick<00:01:33.869> off

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
the tsunami warnings actually kick off

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.130 
the tsunami warnings actually kick off
all<00:01:34.530> emergency<00:01:35.250> response<00:01:35.729> 100%<00:01:36.570> alert<00:01:36.900> is

always issued just in case the tsunami

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.020 
always issued just in case the tsunami
comes<00:01:40.170> and<00:01:40.619> that<00:01:40.829> that<00:01:41.070> you<00:01:41.250> know<00:01:41.549> potentially

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
comes and that that you know potentially
