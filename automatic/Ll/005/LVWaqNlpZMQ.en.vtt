00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.990
 john people yarasky their mugs at again 

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:17.130
 a new complete here on my channel 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.869
 races gaming 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.670
 on the abyss gameplay from 4th a team 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.509
 deathmatch 6 against 6 gameplay hautement 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.770
 prison break 

00:00:21.509 --> 00:00:24.750
 of course I just use a brake 

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:26.340
 tons of five with the suppressor and externally 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.410
 it mixes and the weapon is real 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.509
 just a flap like you with me 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.060
 plays I leave anyway to a samus 

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:35.130
 on that we drop at the first 

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:37.200
 is one of the easiest chemos to 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.450
 play 10 that girl but it is also the 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.850
 game was with the biggest and hardest 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.470
 Kempers ever so it is more convenient ice cream 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.120
 eines rob new ups so you actually 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:46.680
 just a little quiet very much 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.900
 people also use the set come intimate 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.550
 with mesh because they don't have any other things 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:52.200
 have a lures for example so it is 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.910
 really a very nice game to 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.500
 and a very easy way to go 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.450
 to play but also a whole 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.640
 frustrating game ever to play as 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:01.710
 you really come across rock hard creams 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.970
 what you come to this team web fairly often 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.229
 human so yes then you should be fine 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:06.180
 pay attention just march against this kind 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.740
 Man comes where I can play against 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.189
 get your nice score and mine 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:13.049
 score on the gameplay is then also 42 to 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:16.170
 two I go to my specialist twice 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:18.600
 bonus and so I actually get 2 cam 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.010
 feels like I just pay attention 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.360
 because its a little bit involved 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:23.370
 bullshit but of course make it further 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.840
 no one butt out of 8 and gameplay loop 

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:26.430
 just nice by wait very quickly 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.110
 want to go over with you is name 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.880
 hackers on call or duty ghosts want 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.280
 you know call or duty ghosts is now 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.540
 a while from the very first day was still 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.830
 nothing wrong with the game the second 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.440
 day was nothing wrong with it 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:39.510
 game as the game continues no 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:41.880
 really just progress four days later 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:43.710
 that came out when the hacker stop came 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.750
 kirk hackers were the very first there 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.360
 day but the fourth day there were also 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.760
 hackers just came up with people on that 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.260
 are called miley sires or those are called spongebob 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:53.790
 or called 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.530
 bla bla that bla and it is true anyway 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.820
 general bag more of it and now go there 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.150
 very many people on call or duty 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.100
 ghost 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:02.310
 that is called the year ascii and I get per 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.990
 day about 100 whose inside or so with 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.310
 a photo by Jan 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.799
 I've been in the game for people and me 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.360
 look at that photo and I from boys 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.860
 playstation 3 does not have today 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.580
 turned on how could you be with me in the game 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.470
 have been sitting 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.879
 so I got a little crazy about it 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.739
 I thought for a moment 

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:18.390
 a commentary because they are 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:20.279
 all heckers when you meet me 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:22.109
 and first, a microphone is planned 

00:02:20.279 --> 00:02:24.180
 secondly, I am max prestige and ten 

00:02:22.109 --> 00:02:26.340
 third I get the score of 5000 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.200
 a 10m then I'm not so than 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.640
 is hacking so pay attention if 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.439
 it's me then I'll just be my 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.569
 Microphone in when I put in that 

00:02:31.439 --> 00:02:35.519
 have the mute stand so that you are also regular 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:36.480
 me to play again, but if I 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:37.890
 So don't be and you probably hear it 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.349
 also a different voice 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.670
 and then you also just see all 35 parks 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:43.379
 stand at the bottom because it is not one 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.090
 but there are really just something of 

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:47.189
 20 different people now 10 years 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.719
 ascii eat through perkhek 

00:02:47.189 --> 00:02:50.639
 and by means of a name fence so pay attention 

00:02:48.719 --> 00:02:52.260
 please wait a minute i hope so 

00:02:50.639 --> 00:02:53.370
 fixed it quickly becomes possible 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.319
 Of course for me is a very 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.419
 annoying because I get a lot of tweets 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:58.620
 choose all with fake your breed 

00:02:57.419 --> 00:02:59.970
 and for you is also very annoying 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.169
 because you will be happy to be with me 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.400
 while gaming while I am there 

00:03:01.169 --> 00:03:03.870
 not scared at all 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.519
 so please pay attention and me 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:07.079
 just hope that fixed as soon as possible 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:09.209
 the playstation 4 is also on the 

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:11.219
 Xbox 360 is the full hackers me everywhere 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:13.019
 the lobby here also ticks the chest 

00:03:11.219 --> 00:03:14.639
 mean people are faced with mean bags 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:17.549
 in a leaderboards that just have 

00:03:14.639 --> 00:03:20.189
 really 8 trillion score it though 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:22.260
 impossible that have been for 14 days now 

00:03:20.189 --> 00:03:24.329
 planting time game still heals for a long time 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.010
 for example, the real thing is off 

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:28.169
 no more bag of it and I like it 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:30.299
 pretty very bad that now really 

00:03:28.169 --> 00:03:31.709
 already so for hackers on a new call or 

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:33.449
 duty I don't know how 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:35.010
 is on the place that your fire was mine 

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:37.620
 hector new on the place that you fire 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:39.269
 but on the playstation 3 and xbox 360 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:41.280
 it really just a bullshit sign 

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:42.750
 I do n't nearly die with this on an 18 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:46.290
 art cane by that I have that role 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:48.720
 play and those dogs man oh wow 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:50.189
 every time i die that's that or one 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:52.470
 dog comes to me running the knee 

00:03:50.189 --> 00:03:54.090
 seen if i was a dog on the caliban and 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:54.720
 then in my back comes in enemy and that 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:56.909
 stuff 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:58.620
 oh they are so annoying i had them myself 

00:03:56.909 --> 00:04:00.030
 the first few days are also on because 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:02.009
 I of course not yet with 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:05.340
 specialist only wanted after a while 

00:04:02.009 --> 00:04:06.870
 I thought of all those dogs oh my god they 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:08.400
 exciting and at first just random in that 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:10.470
 joke as you exclaimed in your immediately 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:12.810
 by gekilld be secondly if the 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:14.370
 person being killed is always taken 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:16.560
 payback 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:18.359
 on you because you know that person gekilld 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:20.639
 in addition if that person has turned he 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:21.840
 pepper cup he goes around to 

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:24.330
 run that person back 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:26.940
 the moment it returns to the animal 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:28.860
 and the once to his boss 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:30.750
 can that also you can this is so 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:32.340
 annoying if you die that way 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:33.960
 if that dog is running back or 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:35.460
 if that pw dog tries to pick up one 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:37.139
 cut out or ammo because you have 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:38.819
 just so fire 

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:40.169
 bullets needed to be able to come here 

00:04:38.819 --> 00:04:41.550
 run one more and look at it 

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:42.330
 how many bullets I have to hit if not 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:44.039
 more normal 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:46.800
 The sniper rifle requires three disks 

00:04:44.039 --> 00:04:48.689
 bullets hit you with a march driver slightly 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:50.819
 of five and six bullets and with an esl 

00:04:48.689 --> 00:04:52.680
 really doubt 15 so those things 

00:04:50.819 --> 00:04:54.210
 I think it seems annoying but they run 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:55.740
 probably will soon 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:57.900
 fixed it, they are likely 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:59.849
 be made slightly less strong 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:01.439
 by in finds the rinsing system 

00:04:59.849 --> 00:05:03.479
 is also still improving 

00:05:01.439 --> 00:05:05.039
 have in finding that is tweeted in between 

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:06.539
 are still working on it 

00:05:05.039 --> 00:05:08.430
 and I just hope that as the game goes 

00:05:06.539 --> 00:05:10.560
 pulling together is going to be what the heck is 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:12.779
 assume that the buster assume that the 

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:14.610
 lots of it goes out that a few weapons 

00:05:12.779 --> 00:05:16.740
 as the search engines become stronger 

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:18.509
 made the esl drivers a little less 

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:20.129
 be made strong because at the moment 

00:05:18.509 --> 00:05:22.080
 if you play call of duty ghosts it is 

00:05:20.129 --> 00:05:24.689
 just as a so use grapes and 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:26.039
 brakes donna a12 and fhd that also 

00:05:24.689 --> 00:05:28.620
 is strong then you are just in it 

00:05:26.039 --> 00:05:29.879
 advantage to everyone 

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:31.979
 the so drive is simply created above it 

00:05:29.879 --> 00:05:34.500
 everything the glue machines on the other hand 

00:05:31.979 --> 00:05:36.060
 are also still chill like the m 27j there 

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:39.270
 was yesterday and Kem had taken a strike 

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:40.860
 and uploaded the day before even though a 

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:42.029
 and gloomy shingle is not really nice at all 

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:44.400
 to use and that comes naturally 

00:05:42.029 --> 00:05:46.080
 because firstly the directories are real big 

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:47.460
 and they are machines for the close 

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:48.990
 quarters combat 

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:50.789
 and second because the esl doubts 

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:52.680
 just have a higher damage so yes 

00:05:50.789 --> 00:05:55.500
 you just have to go a bit 

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:58.319
 pay attention that it is best to use a sl 

00:05:55.500 --> 00:06:00.360
 driver but I hope they do 

00:05:58.319 --> 00:06:02.009
 machines are made slightly stronger and 

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:03.719
 that just esl doubts a little less 

00:06:02.009 --> 00:06:05.250
 be made strong in 

00:06:03.719 --> 00:06:07.020
 updates soon i don't know yet 

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:08.520
 if that's really going to happen because it is 

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:11.270
 of course all to infinity 'word 

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:13.529
 I have no say in that and yes 

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:15.689
 10,000 people like this say then you have 

00:06:13.529 --> 00:06:17.009
 they still do not have a say as 100,000 

00:06:15.689 --> 00:06:18.839
 to tell people that that should happen 

00:06:17.009 --> 00:06:20.189
 then you do have to speak up, but yes in 

00:06:18.839 --> 00:06:21.629
 find who becomes the path what they own 

00:06:20.189 --> 00:06:23.580
 want patcher and who listens one 

00:06:21.629 --> 00:06:24.449
 bit to us but still like us 

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:26.729
 say 

00:06:24.449 --> 00:06:28.409
 knock in a kem strike with which you get 50 

00:06:26.729 --> 00:06:29.879
 have to get kills and that just the 

00:06:28.409 --> 00:06:32.099
 whole game is little they go to
