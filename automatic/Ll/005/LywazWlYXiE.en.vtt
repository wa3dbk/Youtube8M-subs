00:00:13.709 --> 00:00:17.650
 attention to the following special episode 

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:21.099
 contains spoilers 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:23.560
 moreover if you have not finished the game there 

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:25.000
 we advise against watching a good one 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:28.239
 vision 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.710
 Hello everyone and welcome back to the place in 

00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:31.629
 this special episode I'll show you 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:34.000
 as required in the comments like 

00:00:31.629 --> 00:00:38.950
 glitch the buildings 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:42.670
 button to play them ok I remind you that 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:46.300
 this function of being expresses 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:48.570
 on the sp that ever adverse a good one 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.570
 vision 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.690
 to carry out this it says 20 will have to 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:57.760
 having gone through all 96 successes 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:00.789
 go to the yellow building 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:04.830
 take down next and without you 

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:07.390
 in the level cell ex that as such in three 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.700
 as we wanted together down and on 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:13.600
 rate for sail itself 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:16.000
 without a level the launch so smooth 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:18.549
 this works precisely with this 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.969
 especially with down key threats 

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:25.420
 left right or up together with select 

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:26.710
 because it will allow you to play with 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:30.789
 levels like these or even 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:33.130
 even thinks of castles in 

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:35.289
 however, any moment can bring you 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:37.750
 also of the different grays therefore been 

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:41.469
 very careful we go ad hoc place 2 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:44.979
 this time now in this case we will have to 

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:48.670
 press sise select and without but there 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:52.420
 secret 3 so we can come back 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:54.640
 a green step as mentioned is important 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:56.289
 don't play too much with this says 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:59.110
 because it really could 

00:01:56.289 --> 00:02:03.369
 lead to strange or layered maps 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:06.130
 strange and above all in any way 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:08.739
 on any occasion not saved 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.750
 absolutely your game otherwise 

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:14.049
 could bribe bailout e 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:15.700
 lost all the data I network and said 

00:02:14.049 --> 00:02:18.700
 this is however already the 100th center 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:22.090
 because you have to unlock all 96 le 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:24.340
 exits for the level next then a lot 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:27.160
 attention obviously with me owes you 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:28.000
 see the button steps are 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:31.840
 completely empty 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.130
 well completed you must press must 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.889
 exit at levels 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:42.730
 let's look at the king switch palace we press 

00:02:35.889 --> 00:02:45.220
 su and select and without but a backdoor ok e 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:48.130
 magically slowly very slowly 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:51.220
 because he is making movements that are not 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:53.950
 I know why he does it a bit like a 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:57.040
 prince chain matrix apparently i 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:03:02.319
 your teleporters but it will take you floor 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:06.069
 plan to when you hear this 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:08.810
 but press tea and find yourself in the palace 

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:12.870
 red of the buttons 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:14.400
 now I don't know why, for example, I don't know here 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:16.590
 because I can't can't 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.180
 actually he took a life here 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:20.940
 anyway that I've been like 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:23.970
 actually take the most out of 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:27.480
 passers- by from the button buildings since 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:28.860
 in that of the main adventure not 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:31.530
 I apparently did the first two 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:33.050
 however for the last the blue we must 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:36.660
 go into confidence in two 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:39.270
 renzi right and select and without refresco 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:41.400
 us house so we can go 

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:45.870
 face the blue that we don't have yet 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:48.780
 seen in the sprints it is worth ok collected 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:51.450
 all the coins or almost anyway the 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:55.340
 most yellow coins for 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:59.580
 avoid pressing then the blue p switch 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:04:01.500
 he actually can't 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:04.500
 collecting the gray coins falling 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:07.590
 from the enemies which will be and all you can 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:11.700
 get a life rather two lives 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:16.590
 even ok now we go out we go to 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:18.720
