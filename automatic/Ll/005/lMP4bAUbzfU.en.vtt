00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
you in between them and then they'll

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.929 
you in between them and then they'll
both<00:01:17.369> be<00:01:17.400> attacking<00:01:17.939> at<00:01:18.060> the<00:01:18.119> same<00:01:18.330> time<00:01:18.600> so

00:01:19.929 --> 00:01:19.939 
both be attacking at the same time so

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:22.399

after<00:01:20.939> losing<00:01:21.509> to<00:01:21.600> them<00:01:21.720> the<00:01:21.840> first<00:01:21.990> time<00:01:22.350> I

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
after losing to them the first time I

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.109 
after losing to them the first time I
decided<00:01:22.920> that<00:01:23.040> the<00:01:23.250> best<00:01:23.280> strategy<00:01:23.939> would<00:01:23.970> be

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
decided that the best strategy would be

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.480 
decided that the best strategy would be
to<00:01:24.210> just<00:01:24.450> take<00:01:24.689> one<00:01:24.930> out<00:01:25.110> first<00:01:26.070> and<00:01:26.340> really

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
to just take one out first and really

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.120 
to just take one out first and really
concentrate<00:01:26.790> your<00:01:27.240> fire<00:01:27.420> on<00:01:27.479> one<00:01:28.130> because

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
concentrate your fire on one because

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.649 
concentrate your fire on one because
what<00:01:29.310> happens<00:01:29.670> is<00:01:29.880> one<00:01:30.119> of<00:01:30.240> them<00:01:30.360> is<00:01:30.509> gonna

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
what happens is one of them is gonna

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.630 
what happens is one of them is gonna
come<00:01:30.930> well<00:01:31.110> both<00:01:31.380> kind<00:01:31.619> of<00:01:31.710> sail<00:01:32.070> away<00:01:32.250> and

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.670 
come well both kind of sail away and
they're<00:01:33.090> gonna<00:01:33.180> try<00:01:33.450> to<00:01:33.509> make<00:01:33.930> you<00:01:34.200> know<00:01:34.380> a<00:01:34.409> big

circle back so you're kind of gonna have

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.719 
circle back so you're kind of gonna have
a<00:01:36.450> time<00:01:36.780> to<00:01:37.049> get<00:01:37.170> one<00:01:37.290> of<00:01:37.380> them<00:01:37.439> isolated<00:01:38.070> if

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
a time to get one of them isolated if

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.780 
a time to get one of them isolated if
you<00:01:38.880> focus<00:01:39.210> on<00:01:39.299> one<00:01:39.540> and<00:01:39.950> just<00:01:40.950> force<00:01:41.430> it<00:01:41.610> to

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
you focus on one and just force it to

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.840 
you focus on one and just force it to
fight<00:01:42.000> back<00:01:42.270> at<00:01:42.570> you<00:01:42.750> then<00:01:43.229> um<00:01:43.500> you<00:01:44.399> can<00:01:44.549> kind

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
fight back at you then um you can kind

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.840 
fight back at you then um you can kind
of<00:01:45.049> keep<00:01:46.049> away<00:01:46.229> so<00:01:46.979> you<00:01:47.070> can<00:01:47.220> only<00:01:47.310> concentrate

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
of keep away so you can only concentrate

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.609 
of keep away so you can only concentrate
on<00:01:48.119> one<00:01:48.240> of<00:01:48.450> the<00:01:48.540> time<00:01:48.750> and<00:01:48.990> once<00:01:49.140> you<00:01:49.290> get<00:01:49.409> one

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
on one of the time and once you get one

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.530 
on one of the time and once you get one
of<00:01:49.740> them<00:01:49.860> down<00:01:50.009> the<00:01:50.850> other<00:01:50.970> one's<00:01:51.180> gonna<00:01:51.390> be

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
of them down the other one's gonna be

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.330 
of them down the other one's gonna be
pretty<00:01:51.780> easy<00:01:51.869> because<00:01:52.380> you<00:01:52.829> only<00:01:52.979> have<00:01:53.220> to

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
pretty easy because you only have to

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.819 
pretty easy because you only have to
have<00:01:53.430> one<00:01:53.490> ship<00:01:53.970> to<00:01:54.149> concentrate<00:01:54.689> on<00:01:54.829> so

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
have one ship to concentrate on so

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.679 
have one ship to concentrate on so
there's<00:01:56.070> nothing<00:01:56.189> really<00:01:56.399> spectacular<00:01:56.759> with

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
there's nothing really spectacular with

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:00.200 
there's nothing really spectacular with
this<00:01:57.899> that's<00:01:58.259> pretty<00:01:58.920> much<00:01:59.130> you<00:01:59.640> know<00:01:59.759> how<00:02:00.180> I

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
this that's pretty much you know how I

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.139 
this that's pretty much you know how I
did<00:02:00.479> it<00:02:00.950> the<00:02:01.950> one<00:02:02.130> thing<00:02:02.340> I<00:02:02.460> will<00:02:02.640> say<00:02:02.670> is<00:02:02.909> that

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
did it the one thing I will say is that

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
go back into it again but spend some

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.330 
go back into it again but spend some
time<00:02:59.640> riah<00:03:00.239> on<00:03:00.600> your<00:03:00.750> supplies<00:03:01.110> get<00:03:01.920> you<00:03:02.220> know

your<00:03:02.489> mortar<00:03:02.790> stocks<00:03:03.090> full<00:03:03.480> again<00:03:03.780> get<00:03:04.200> your

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
your mortar stocks full again get your

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.170 
your mortar stocks full again get your
cannon<00:03:04.650> stocks<00:03:04.920> full<00:03:05.190> again<00:03:05.489> because<00:03:05.970> those

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
cannon stocks full again because those

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.000 
cannon stocks full again because those
mortars<00:03:06.540> really<00:03:06.989> make<00:03:07.170> a<00:03:07.200> huge<00:03:07.410> difference<00:03:07.860> in

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
mortars really make a huge difference in

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.970 
mortars really make a huge difference in
making<00:03:08.160> his<00:03:08.370> battles<00:03:08.760> go<00:03:08.880> faster<00:03:09.300> and<00:03:09.980> only

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
making his battles go faster and only

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.520 
making his battles go faster and only
having<00:03:11.370> three<00:03:11.400> shots<00:03:12.110> puts<00:03:13.110> you<00:03:13.200> at<00:03:13.320> a<00:03:13.350> major

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
having three shots puts you at a major

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:15.560 
having three shots puts you at a major
disadvantage<00:03:13.910> and<00:03:14.910> I<00:03:15.000> think<00:03:15.209> I<00:03:15.269> would<00:03:15.450> have

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:15.570 
disadvantage and I think I would have

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:18.350 
disadvantage and I think I would have
gotten<00:03:15.750> this<00:03:15.930> battle<00:03:16.920> done<00:03:17.100> a<00:03:17.370> lot<00:03:17.730> faster<00:03:17.940> had

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:18.360 
gotten this battle done a lot faster had

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:23.090 
gotten this battle done a lot faster had
I<00:03:18.390> had<00:03:18.660> those<00:03:21.049> so<00:03:22.049> one<00:03:22.230> thing<00:03:22.470> that<00:03:22.500> might<00:03:22.680> be

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:23.100 
I had those so one thing that might be

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:25.220 
I had those so one thing that might be
stating<00:03:23.790> the<00:03:24.060> obvious<00:03:24.090> for<00:03:24.720> some<00:03:24.840> of<00:03:24.959> you<00:03:25.080> but

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
stating the obvious for some of you but

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:28.940 
stating the obvious for some of you but
for<00:03:25.290> some<00:03:25.590> others<00:03:26.160> it's<00:03:26.640> not<00:03:27.560> you<00:03:28.560> can<00:03:28.709> turn<00:03:28.920> a

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
for some others it's not you can turn a

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:30.680 
for some others it's not you can turn a
lot<00:03:29.160> faster<00:03:29.610> when<00:03:29.970> you<00:03:30.090> stop<00:03:30.390> your<00:03:30.600> boat

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
lot faster when you stop your boat

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:32.390 
lot faster when you stop your boat
completely<00:03:30.930> so<00:03:31.590> a<00:03:31.620> lot<00:03:31.860> of<00:03:31.890> times<00:03:32.130> when<00:03:32.310> I'm

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
completely so a lot of times when I'm

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.500 
completely so a lot of times when I'm
doing<00:03:32.640> these<00:03:32.730> battles<00:03:33.209> well<00:03:34.110> you<00:03:34.350> know<00:03:34.440> hit<00:03:34.799> a

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:35.510 
doing these battles well you know hit a

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:37.490 
doing these battles well you know hit a
continuously<00:03:36.510> to<00:03:36.690> try<00:03:36.810> to<00:03:36.900> get<00:03:37.019> my<00:03:37.140> boat<00:03:37.320> going

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
continuously to try to get my boat going

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.319 
continuously to try to get my boat going
as<00:03:37.650> fast<00:03:37.799> as<00:03:38.010> you<00:03:38.100> can<00:03:38.310> and<00:03:38.910> you<00:03:39.000> can't

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:39.329 
as fast as you can and you can't

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:40.430 
as fast as you can and you can't
unfortunately<00:03:39.870> when<00:03:39.989> you're<00:03:40.110> fighting<00:03:40.230> these

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
unfortunately when you're fighting these

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:41.840 
unfortunately when you're fighting these
legendary<00:03:40.799> ships<00:03:41.100> you<00:03:41.220> can't<00:03:41.459> get<00:03:41.549> to<00:03:41.640> top

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:41.850 
legendary ships you can't get to top

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:43.100 
legendary ships you can't get to top
speed<00:03:42.180> and<00:03:42.390> then<00:03:42.510> where<00:03:42.630> it<00:03:42.690> kind<00:03:42.870> of<00:03:42.900> pulls

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:43.110 
speed and then where it kind of pulls

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:44.270 
speed and then where it kind of pulls
back<00:03:43.290> the<00:03:43.350> camera<00:03:43.769> and<00:03:43.890> you're<00:03:44.010> going<00:03:44.190> too

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
back the camera and you're going too

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:47.690 
back the camera and you're going too
fast<00:03:44.549> it<00:03:45.329> doesn't<00:03:45.480> let<00:03:45.630> you<00:03:45.720> do<00:03:45.870> that<00:03:46.640> but<00:03:47.640> you
