00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 all salute I yuri okunev this is my bistro 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:06.060
 and today I will give one practical advice 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.919
 from one more question 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:11.630
 un tell how to make the original 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:11.630
 congratulations on valentines day 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:24.900
 film and build so we are talking about 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.760
 making a movie with your own hands and from everyone 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.560
 related nuances tell me 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:33.360
 please what is the main thing 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:34.950
 assistant on the set no this 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.700
 not the camera the camera is the main worker 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:41.250
 the tool and here's the helper is scotch or 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:44.460
 duct tape is such a good phrase 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.680
 which describes the essence of the whole movie is held 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.230
 on scotch scenery 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.690
 so that props and costumes do not fall apart 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.940
 to live one shooting day 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.739
 appliances that did not interfere contained on 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.260
 one place personal example 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.820
 I somehow had my camera 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:01.620
 attach to the tripod with electrical tape 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.800
 and all because I forgot the adapter 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:09.350
 but do not forget your scotch tape maybe 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:12.750
 any wide narrow yellow black 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:14.420
 transparent main thing is that it is good glue 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.700
 and have always been with you 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:19.380
 so do not forget in the comments me 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.840
 once asked about the sword fight 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.800
 since it’s wildly interesting to me 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:28.289
 I myself went to the professionals 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:31.200
 the truth seemed sad for one or 

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:34.020
 even 5 10 issues nothing i'm not 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.899
 I can tell you my program in 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.060
 sword fighting a lot of details 

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:40.860
 the details is covered all made and all his 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.869
 lovely and as the teacher told me 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:46.470
 the difference may be in the smallest 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:47.970
 movements such as protection from above if its 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.179
 make it look wrong 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:53.490
 stupid and inefficient and the only difference is 

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:57.210
 the fact that to do the movement of the brush smoothly 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:59.830
 or raise up or even the whole hand 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:02.590
 at first glance where there is no difference but 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:05.650
 in fact, very big just such 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:07.810
 the details are built all the movements conditionally 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:10.090
 all sword fights can be divided into three 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:12.760
 large groups and where copy 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:15.070
 tournament fights where reconstructs 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.510
 real medieval battle and battle on 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:18.910
 swords for role-playing games 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.560
 The first style can be called the easiest 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:23.260
 although in the movie use it wrong 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.940
 often because the essence of this sword fight 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:27.190
 just that as often as possible 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:30.010
 knock the enemy on the head 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:31.570
 points he was used in tournaments and there 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.400
 there was a completely different technique in 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:35.020
 compared to so used to see in 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.780
 cinema and other places 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:38.890
 those who are engaged in reconstruction 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:41.140
 real medieval battles 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:44.920
 encounters such a problem as many 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:47.410
 school codes or martial directions 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.960
 systems in which each stroke can be 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:51.700
 this is completely differently arranged 

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:53.350
 that real fight we 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:56.230
 we all want to hit we want 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:57.940
 use your film epic 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:00.550
 but unfortunately requires much more 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:02.830
 preparation time 7 but the effect of course 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:04.150
 from him the forty-third option role-playing this 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:06.250
 something in between the first and second 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:08.800
 Variant like here glasses hits 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:10.660
 are considered to be touching or pseudo touching 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:13.060
 enemies and at the same time you swing a sword 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:15.400
 much more active than in a tournament school 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:16.989
 if among my viewers she's boring 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.730
 who really know how to wield a sword 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:20.380
 instead of writing angry 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:22.030
 comments about what I messed up 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:24.280
 some terms and not exactly 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:26.980
 put it better remove a couple of specific 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:28.750
 videos that show as needed 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:30.820
 fight for how to call 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:33.280
 this or that style and send it to me 

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:35.040
 either lay out send me a link i'm though 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:37.630
 share with your viewers 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:39.340
 agreed but practically advice on this 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:41.200
 subject such if you really want 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:41.800
 arrange your film realistic fights 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.270
 on swords 

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:45.230
 it is best to find fans and 

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:47.060
 professionals in their region 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:49.310
 certainly if you search you will find 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:51.470
 society school or particular person 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:52.220
 who can teach you lessons 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:54.379
 fencing 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:56.540
 but it is worth saying here that swordsmen 

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:58.879
 a little dislikes filmmakers 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:01.340
 the reason is simple filmmakers love to bet 

00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:03.440
 beautiful shots even if it is different 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:07.190
 from reality and swordsman doesn't like it 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:09.230
 even enrages, well, now what’s coming is not 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:11.180
 St. Valentine February 14 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:13.010
 since we work with the camera means 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:14.900
 our gifts must be somehow connected 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:17.620
 that’s why we’ll do something with it 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:17.620
 like this 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.630
 about 

00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:39.590
 these beautiful highlights throughout the frame 

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:41.509
 called curly yet 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:43.129
 to achieve this we need to do 

00:04:41.509 --> 00:04:45.409
 stencil for this we need 

00:04:43.129 --> 00:04:47.150
 black paper or cardboard or any 

00:04:45.409 --> 00:04:50.569
 other paper and cardboard which can 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:52.610
 paint black cut krugleshok 

00:04:50.569 --> 00:04:55.099
 or square in the middle cut 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:55.759
 heart shape or any other shape that 

00:04:55.099 --> 00:04:57.499
 Do you want to 

00:04:55.759 --> 00:05:00.259
 we have 10 valentines in this will be 

00:04:57.499 --> 00:05:02.180
 Hearts insert this stencil in 

00:05:00.259 --> 00:05:04.159
 the lens if it is round then it will become 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:05.900
 right into the lens if we made it 

00:05:04.159 --> 00:05:08.029
 square like my case then you can 

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:10.099
 just stick tape on the outside here 

00:05:08.029 --> 00:05:12.409
 By the way, we are still bored for 

00:05:10.099 --> 00:05:14.990
 appearance of glare must be done so that 

00:05:12.409 --> 00:05:17.330
 the background was blurred on it were sources 

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:19.879
 light or at least differences in light 

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:22.370
 if you have a plain background until 

00:05:19.879 --> 00:05:23.990
 It is best to use lenses with 

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:26.899
 large diaphragm that is, those who 

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:29.029
 the number of apertures is smaller I have three 

00:05:26.899 --> 00:05:31.580
 lens and one of them is portrait 

00:05:29.029 --> 00:05:33.080
 9 Soviet- era jupiter lens with it 

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:35.059
 everything turned out quite easily 

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:38.360
 actually just stuck to it 

00:05:35.059 --> 00:05:41.509
 stencil tuned sharpness and then and at 

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:43.770
 I already have a tank with my canons and 

00:05:41.509 --> 00:05:46.280
 sigma was harder 

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:48.509
 I suffered a lot with her and in the end 

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:50.669
 I assume that you need to move the background 

00:05:48.509 --> 00:05:52.560
 light sources much farther better 

00:05:50.669 --> 00:05:54.300
 the whole effect works in the dark 

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:56.310
 when we have contrast lighting 

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:57.860
 that is, contrasting points of light for example 

00:05:56.310 --> 00:06:00.509
 You can use Christmas tree garland 

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:02.879
 candles your quantity or others 

00:06:00.509 --> 00:06:05.280
 small sources of light he himself discovered in this 

00:06:02.879 --> 00:06:07.500
 Approach that such a stencil can be 

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:09.629
 use both for photography and 

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:11.789
 for the video I will say right away that from the first 

00:06:09.629 --> 00:06:12.960
 you may not succeed 

00:06:11.789 --> 00:06:16.050
 have you make a stencil 

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:17.789
 but for the time being I personally suffered almost 

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:20.039
 an hour to understand how it all 

00:06:17.789 --> 00:06:21.389
 I can only work right away 

00:06:20.039 --> 00:06:23.729
 say that if you will 

00:06:21.389 --> 00:06:25.620
 take an exposure 

00:06:23.729 --> 00:06:28.319
 longer put on a tripod 

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:29.699
 although the video tripod is also useful in 

00:06:28.319 --> 00:06:31.440
 anyway even if you haven't 

00:06:29.699 --> 00:06:33.539
 get the first time take the time 

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:35.310
 on experiments as a last resort you can 

00:06:33.539 --> 00:06:37.229
 wait for the darkness to go some 

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:38.729
 shop or verified on the street where 

00:06:37.229 --> 00:06:40.770
 there is a lantern so you immediately 

00:06:38.729 --> 00:06:42.810
 will see your running or not yet 

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:45.719
 working on the fact that the lights away background 

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:47.250
 will be blurry shorter experiment 

00:06:45.719 --> 00:06:50.099
 this is probably all 

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:51.900
 put likes subscribe write in 

00:06:50.099 --> 00:06:54.840
 comments here on yu tuba and in a group 

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:57.979
 VKontakte and of course we shoot a movie 

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:57.979
 was my system
