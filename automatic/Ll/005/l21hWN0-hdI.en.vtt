like this I can see some of the colors
kind<00:03:51.609> of<00:03:51.790> peeking<00:03:52.150> through<00:03:52.180> but<00:03:53.109> we're<00:03:53.260> going

00:03:53.369 --> 00:03:53.379 
kind of peeking through but we're going

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:55.080 
kind of peeking through but we're going

to give them a chance to really show
through<00:03:55.450> in<00:03:55.480> our<00:03:55.870> next<00:03:56.260> step<00:03:57.540> the<00:03:58.540> next<00:03:58.569> step

00:03:59.190 --> 00:03:59.200 
through in our next step the next step

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:03.569 
through in our next step the next step
is<00:03:59.469> the<00:04:00.010> etching<00:04:00.609> part<00:04:01.980> so<00:04:02.980> you<00:04:03.040> take<00:04:03.400> your

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:03.579 
is the etching part so you take your

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:05.699 
is the etching part so you take your
popsicle<00:04:04.000> stick<00:04:04.510> and<00:04:04.840> you're<00:04:05.290> going<00:04:05.409> to<00:04:05.439> use

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:05.709 
popsicle stick and you're going to use

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:08.789 
popsicle stick and you're going to use
this<00:04:06.010> as<00:04:06.280> a<00:04:06.340> drawing<00:04:07.060> tool<00:04:07.620> we're<00:04:08.620> going<00:04:08.650> to

00:04:08.789 --> 00:04:08.799 
this as a drawing tool we're going to

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:12.449 
this as a drawing tool we're going to
pretend<00:04:09.250> it's<00:04:09.519> a<00:04:09.849> pencil<00:04:10.209> or<00:04:10.870> a<00:04:10.900> marker<00:04:11.620> and

00:04:12.449 --> 00:04:12.459 
pretend it's a pencil or a marker and

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:15.860 
pretend it's a pencil or a marker and
we're<00:04:13.180> going<00:04:13.389> to<00:04:13.510> make<00:04:13.750> lines<00:04:14.199> and<00:04:14.769> shapes

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:15.870 
we're going to make lines and shapes

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:19.289 
we're going to make lines and shapes
carving<00:04:16.870> them<00:04:17.049> out<00:04:17.289> of<00:04:17.500> the<00:04:17.620> black<00:04:17.889> blanket<00:04:18.299> to

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:19.299 
carving them out of the black blanket to

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:23.070 
carving them out of the black blanket to
let<00:04:19.449> the<00:04:19.599> colors<00:04:19.930> show<00:04:20.289> through<00:04:20.709> like<00:04:21.280> this<00:04:22.080> so

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:23.080

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:28.030 
watch this if I make a line pressing

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:30.029 
watch this if I make a line pressing
hard<00:04:28.330> we're<00:04:28.570> doing<00:04:28.870> a<00:04:28.990> lot<00:04:29.199> of<00:04:29.229> pressing<00:04:29.770> hard

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:34.660 
today we're using our muscles and I can

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:38.790 
today we're using our muscles and I can
scrape<00:04:35.229> away<00:04:35.530> the<00:04:36.490> black<00:04:36.910> layer<00:04:37.660> the<00:04:38.500> black
