00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250 
academic assignment and the whole point

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:15.800 
academic assignment and the whole point
of<00:04:14.460> this<00:04:14.640> is<00:04:14.910> that<00:04:15.180> it's<00:04:15.330> a<00:04:15.600> piece<00:04:15.780> of

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810 
of this is that it's a piece of

of this is that it's a piece of

independent work independent research
that<00:04:18.600> the<00:04:18.690> student<00:04:19.110> will<00:04:19.200> do<00:04:19.350> outside<00:04:19.950> of

that the student will do outside of

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:22.070 
that the student will do outside of
college<00:04:20.459> so<00:04:21.090> obviously<00:04:21.510> it<00:04:21.570> does<00:04:21.750> help<00:04:22.020> to

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:22.080 
college so obviously it does help to

the computers across campus and they're

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:36.710 
the computers across campus and they're
also<00:04:35.370> learning<00:04:35.700> how<00:04:35.880> to<00:04:36.030> reference<00:04:36.330> things

will be forty yuccas points lower in

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:58.370 
will be forty yuccas points lower in

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:00.530 
a map student so their offer would be

a map student so their offer would be
BBB<00:05:01.530> so<00:05:02.010> far<00:05:02.190> tu<00:05:02.430> cus<00:05:02.670> points<00:05:03.150> is<00:05:03.300> equivalent

BBB so far tu cus points is equivalent
