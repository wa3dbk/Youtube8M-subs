00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.180
 I'm going to make a video here today. 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:07.620
 here in g2 it's a little dark but 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.019
 at the points where I wanted to be seen in 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:13.380
 light car the basic alignment right 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:15.389
 Alignment of bodywork repainting ne e 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:18.000
 where it was repainted was a single hit 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:20.130
 was an alignment of parts and 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.130
 It's only basic, you know. 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.019
 suspension condition and basic tire is 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.029
 inside it looks like the car is fine 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.840
 well let's go inside that I want 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.840
 you see me 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:37.920
 if the four electrical locks are 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.290
 it only works on the key, right? 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.180
 and if when you say lock the door and 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.079
 unlocked the trunk and a 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.750
 tank 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:48.149
 perhaps it is these points there 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:52.350
 locked and the tank is 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:59.430
 working inside the car when you 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:01:06.270
 turn on the car will turn on the car key 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:10.110
 he will do a check in when he 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:13.650
 I think he checks 100's of everything and 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.990
 then it will erase and it will stay with 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.180
 this yellow light and the certainty that in the 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:21.900
 it's the rear brake hands check 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:23.970
 is on the other side to stay on the abs 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.460
 and electronic injection light 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:29.400
 when you turn on the key, 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.740
 that the light of the exchange it also lights 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.509
 then she pays for everything she has to 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.740
 delete that is the exchange check 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.750
 automatic is 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.729
 and this light here from the head of the brake light 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.950
 when you step on the brake pedal she 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:44.210
 have to erase that done in the 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.210
 match in hand 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:50.020
 There can not be any lights on there. 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:51.820
 already noticed you happen read the pressure 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:54.520
 the oil has to rise 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:59.040
 usually it goes up to the next 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:02:01.570
 three friends alÃ³ getting 4 bar lyon 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.880
 accelerating at idle it should 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:07.420
 stay close by in between three and four 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:11.350
 bars right turn temperature marker 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:12.940
 It's working, everything is right there. 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:15.700
 will make the assemblies tied 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:17.860
 I changed that ball there in the first place 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.450
 have to change 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:23.920
 every step he has to take 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:27.460
 also not corresponding to the gears 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:31.270
 ok packaged critical cases is 

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:34.060
 It works for me, my computer. 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:35.709
 board is here or on the island here 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.180
 according to the functions of me is 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:37.930
 operating the computer functions of 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:41.110
 board 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:43.030
 It 's time to take a check and see how 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:46.120
 is that the question of the sound of the car is 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:47.260
 is working in the car is not 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.820
 has a lot of secrecy 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:52.260
 What I want you to see for me 

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:55.209
 mainly the automatic exchange 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:58.959
 the automatic gearbox of that expensive car 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:03:01.630
 it is he not the upshift 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:04.570
 incredible softness so you do not 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:07.630
 realize you do not notice any 

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:09.070
 tranquil can not give strings is changing 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:11.980
 when you ride the car 

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:14.260
 is very sweaty goal Andal okay and is the 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:15.940
 following the clutches of the exchange rate is 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.160
 have spent it will not do that 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:21.100
 I'll show you now, the car is 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:25.480
 in park I tread on the brakes it 's tread 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:28.390
 on the brake and then you put the drive 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:32.140
 I put it there on a sure drive . 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:35.950
 brake accelerator until the cover can accelerate 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:37.870
 even the board can not exceed 2,000 rpm 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:41.349
 O 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:42.519
 he was there right and that's the records 

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:44.799
 of exchange rate 

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:47.349
 if you have the gear 

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:49.930
 torque converter when you fled 

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:52.720
 do it it will give a quickened it 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:54.579
 will accelerate up to 3,000 and 3,500 understood 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:57.040
 can not right 

00:03:54.579 --> 00:03:58.000
 this is the Achilles heel of the omega 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:01.360
 OK 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:04.090
 the rest is car would be expensive is double would be 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:06.819
 the car round if're not hitting anything 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:08.650
 if the air works, it will not work if the 

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:12.370
 panel makes the check is for all 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:14.410
 this is basically the engine 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:21.130
 accelerating there gives you the hunting 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:22.410
 engine is good I will not open bonza bonnet 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:26.340
 here on the cover 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:26.340
 left the other side 

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:36.320
 It's dark in here, but you can 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:37.400
 throttle here only on the engine and is 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:38.810
 just my old 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:43.150
 Let's see if I can send this video. 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:43.150
 all by whatsapp even now hug
