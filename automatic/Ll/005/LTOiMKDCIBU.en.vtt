00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:32.230
 a club I've always liked hair since little leake just the amish 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:33.820
 barris 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:38.540
 I love people and I like to make them feel better with themselves. 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:41.420
 I was in the incident three years and decided 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:45.060
 I needed to make a change because I was not happy with what I was doing 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:49.190
 the turf my first experience was six months ago 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:52.190
 I had never touched scissors before 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:57.790
 In addition course type in belgium I liked it a lot and besides it was good at 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:59.550
 that 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.360
 Chanel mother discovered that I wear it in the blood roosters parana 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:08.230
 but the ball many stylists and each and every one 

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:12.350
 of them, whenever I asked them, they told me about the AFP power 

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:21.260
 I read past the 5 ton founder discovered that there are basic ways in 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:22.550
 the haircuts 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:26.950
 it affects me so well to define it so any haircut is a 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:30.000
 combination of those basic forms 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.130
 therefore it is a very simple and structured way of doing it 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:38.710
 sometimes I was afraid of being the worst in all but everything makes sense 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:42.860
 you know what you have to do 1 how do you have to do it 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.790
 the people who have found my class is amazing I just love it 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:53.770
 We support each other a lot when a partner has made a great 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:56.790
 I work at a client, we say that has been great 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.760
 and we collaborate with each other you know as if someone is not motivated 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:03.850
 let's see a little nudge trade we did not think this surgery 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:07.560
 We are definitely fostering the community if someone has a problem 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.410
 we are all going to lend a hand how they dressed and weigh in the waves at 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:12.689
 Water 

00:02:12.689 --> 00:02:17.379
 we see transcribed waves to the water take you out of the nerves I practiced to the waves 

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:22.079
 to the water again and again they simply did not leave anything as if it had not been for 

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:25.260
 the teacher would have left you already know the waves to the water equal 

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:31.670
 this animal until they reach the one that gets to overcome another nudge 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:34.990
 until little by little you get tinelli you realize 

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:38.280
 that you can create those wonderful things with all the expectations 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.500
 that you have put is doing amazing things argüelles of education 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.980
 that you have here I would not say that what the dreaded of all this is like Cuba 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.560
 is cutting hair 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.489
 I'm doing color but rather I'm creating Argentine 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:57.060
 you are a stylist we do not call you cutting the hair we carry it carve the hair 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.750
 because I effectively exhibit a sculpture in three dimensions just like the color 

00:03:01.749 --> 00:03:04.930
 is present in a painting and that is also in the hair but not 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:08.549
 you can make yourself a picture feel good about yourself month however you can 

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:11.909
 make a person feel amazing with herself I think that 

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:15.919
 when you're working on the affection of the people it's not so much an expression 

00:03:15.919 --> 00:03:20.499
 of the stylist but of the person and being able to say okay is this what you want if this 

00:03:20.499 --> 00:03:23.739
 is what you have told me now we are going to do been work to make your hair 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:28.480
 represent who you are I read in the second in which you go out into the real world you know 

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:32.919
 how is it a clientele and how to treat people the way I see them 

00:03:32.919 --> 00:03:36.569
 provincial interior is international because it is much more than cutting the 

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:41.239
 hair following styles and trends and I really like to know that there are people in 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:45.029
 everybody studying the same things that I do because it's how you know you can 

00:03:45.029 --> 00:03:48.029
 that we have the same failed ideas 

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:52.530
 jaua I go down the street with this shirt and they do not stop offering my work and I 

00:03:52.529 --> 00:03:54.520
 as for authentic holy faith 

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:58.450
 but you have already told me when you graduate, we always look for pivot point students 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:02.509
 each one we will do different things more will work in a room 

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:06.429
 I really do not feel like working in the salon I prefer to dedicate myself to fashion 

00:04:06.429 --> 00:04:10.909
 walkways photo sessions more creative dresses paid so commercial 

00:04:10.909 --> 00:04:14.279
 and in the way you have taught us, you can do whatever you want 

00:04:14.279 --> 00:04:17.689
 pérez-jaén emerges as if I had not gone to pivot point to form myself as 

00:04:17.689 --> 00:04:22.040
 stylist would probably still be in high school feeling miserable and 

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:24.139
 they cut people's hair in any way 

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:28.409
 really live my life doing something that I love to do instead of in great 

00:04:28.409 --> 00:04:32.300
 part every day knowing what you do justin smoak this is much better 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:35.300
 that an office job 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:40.360
 starting with the best we will get farther and faster 

00:04:42.689 --> 00:04:46.319
 for this one and proud that the name of pivot point is behind me 

00:04:46.319 --> 00:04:49.319
 education 

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:54.509
 cross
