 insert a tattoo into a photo 

00:00:10.149 --> 00:00:13.149
 then we open gimp 

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:16.859
 let's go to file 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.859

 let's drag in 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.740

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:37.880
 I'm talking about it anymore 

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:40.880

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:46.010

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.500
 let's go to the move tool 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:13.580
 in the position in the desired point 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:20.570
 at this point we must 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:24.340
 rate it 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:29.540
 if we are a little big you come back 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:31.950
 on the scale tool 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.460

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:44.800
 then click on three levels 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:47.940
 multiplier 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:49.140
 We can 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.410
