 I'll show you what ore is used to deal with the residents . 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:58.000
 Where's the ore? 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.130

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.010
 Let me 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:23.850
 And there is also npc which strengthens the light and the enemy . 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:27.170
 It's mpc and random. 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:27.170
 And where to check 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:33.600
 I'll show you how to make a book that can be used once. 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:38.470
 Once you have the feathers 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.760

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.670

 15 Is this what what what 3 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.400
 Usually you only need books. 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:14.800
 When it's dark 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:20.020
 I want you to put me in front of Joe. 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:27.280
 Oh, I've got another item search, too, but I want to know exactly how to write this. 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:27.280
 I'm using it. 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:37.100
 Thus, if one reads laying up yonder 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:42.800
 If you listen to this place a long way, and this book reveals, it will come out of your book. 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:46.570
 One can not be modified once write this column and right-click the name used when the bandit 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:46.570
 It's a book title Jeongneung 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:54.150
 And 

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:54.150
 I can install a home leverage on that house. 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:02.290
 What was less talk has been've Lang LAN multiplayer browser midnight when I 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:05.849
 Looking for a server 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:05.849
 Lang gonna like this hanging hamachi 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:14.340
 105 yen The test is in one place like this 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:20.490
 When an item on the left side of the ground so the ground where the earth also second 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:24.140
 Put me so if you're connected to Mei are now connected, so again 

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:24.140
 Ente test is very good 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:31.190
 Now the double lines come out like this. 

00:04:33.529 --> 00:04:38.409
 And to vow that item that you do not know the meander I came 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:43.640
 I do not know exactly. 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:52.430
 I have a single player command. Press enter to write the command. 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:58.009
 So the command that we know best 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:05:02.060
 / Game mode Survivors will be creative in appearance 

00:04:58.009 --> 00:05:07.990
 I put a number and write down his name in his name . 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:07.990
 Is a game mode that you just press and it changes to Vibe 

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:14.610
 Now I do not think I need a single command. 

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:20.379
 And now 

00:05:18.349 --> 00:05:20.379
 uh 

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:30.460
 What does this mean? There are eight Enderishi Won that will not be used as a silk touch rope. 

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:33.580
 I will. 

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:36.040
 Uh, and I think I waited three . 

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:41.860
 4 per 1 

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:44.220
 So from here, perhaps a frightening new to the temple built in the desert 

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:44.220
 I guess. 

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:55.169
 Where to extract more from the dispenser d Now diversion poured a large circle on the sales price 

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:55.169
 It can. 

00:05:56.209 --> 00:05:58.659
 how was it 

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:17.040
 The sky's a little smaller and a bit brighter 

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:19.610
 It's a jungle heart, too. Death. It's not just business . 

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:19.610
 It's weird. 

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:26.340
 And let 's have 16 buckets of pick buckets . 

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:34.330
 * Give me six . 

00:06:35.199 --> 00:06:43.050
 After completing the rough explanation, the next version of Phone Appstop Promptor 1.3 

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:43.050
 5.5 We will lock 

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:46.550
 And 

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:53.999
 I 'll just finish the plan. 

00:06:50.919 --> 00:06:53.999
 Then I'll see you next time
