00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:10.569 
reason only reason Barney's chewing this

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:12.120 
reason only reason Barney's chewing this
is<00:02:10.720> because<00:02:10.990> I<00:02:11.200> stuff<00:02:11.500> treats<00:02:11.800> in<00:02:11.920> here

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130

is because I stuff treats in here
basically<00:02:12.490> this<00:02:12.970> is<00:02:13.150> how<00:02:13.300> you<00:02:13.360> do<00:02:13.690> it<00:02:13.840> you<00:02:14.110> just

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:14.350 
basically this is how you do it you just
