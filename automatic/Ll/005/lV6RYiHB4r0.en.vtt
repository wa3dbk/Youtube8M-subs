00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:20.660

the<00:05:22.610> possibility<00:05:22.820> that<00:05:23.570> they<00:05:24.200> could<00:05:24.229> be

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:24.590 
the possibility that they could be

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:26.020 
the possibility that they could be
addicted<00:05:24.979> to<00:05:25.010> food<00:05:25.250> that<00:05:25.430> they<00:05:25.550> could<00:05:25.790> have<00:05:25.940> an

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:32.810 
heavy because of this and this and this

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:34.420 
heavy because of this and this and this
and<00:05:32.930> this<00:05:33.200> and<00:05:33.350> this<00:05:33.620> is<00:05:33.740> the<00:05:33.979> only<00:05:34.070> reason

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:34.430 
and this and this is the only reason

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:36.640 
and this and this is the only reason
they're<00:05:34.550> heavy<00:05:34.729> I<00:05:34.970> never<00:05:35.840> said<00:05:36.110> that<00:05:36.140> the<00:05:36.470> only

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:36.650 
they're heavy I never said that the only

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:38.920 
they're heavy I never said that the only
reason<00:05:36.860> people<00:05:37.250> are<00:05:37.460> heavy<00:05:37.669> is<00:05:37.880> because<00:05:38.270> they

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:38.930 
reason people are heavy is because they

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:41.050 
reason people are heavy is because they
are<00:05:39.380> emotional<00:05:39.860> eaters<00:05:40.100> I<00:05:40.250> said<00:05:40.520> that's<00:05:40.700> one

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:41.060 
are emotional eaters I said that's one

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:43.360 
are emotional eaters I said that's one
option<00:05:41.360> that's<00:05:41.960> one<00:05:42.140> perspective<00:05:42.380> but<00:05:43.340> I

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:43.370 
option that's one perspective but I

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:44.800 
option that's one perspective but I
think<00:05:43.610> some<00:05:43.820> people<00:05:44.090> are<00:05:44.150> just<00:05:44.210> scared<00:05:44.660> to

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:46.540 
think some people are just scared to
look<00:05:45.020> at<00:05:45.169> that<00:05:45.320> so<00:05:45.500> they<00:05:45.620> just<00:05:45.650> want<00:05:45.979> to<00:05:46.100> sweep

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:46.550
