00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:43.420 
when we put things into gears we twist

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:44.790 
when we put things into gears we twist
them<00:00:43.570> our<00:00:43.690> own<00:00:43.719> certain<00:00:44.170> way<00:00:44.290> to<00:00:44.320> make<00:00:44.559> it<00:00:44.649> kind

of<00:00:44.890> gears<00:00:45.129> like<00:00:45.339> and<00:00:45.579> one<00:00:46.059> thing<00:00:46.210> we've<00:00:46.360> done

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:46.390 
of gears like and one thing we've done

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:47.939 
of gears like and one thing we've done
is<00:00:46.570> it's<00:00:46.780> not<00:00:46.899> just<00:00:46.960> a<00:00:47.199> matter<00:00:47.379> of<00:00:47.469> getting<00:00:47.710> to

00:00:47.939 --> 00:00:47.949 
is it's not just a matter of getting to

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:49.619 
is it's not just a matter of getting to
certain<00:00:48.250> score<00:00:48.460> and<00:00:48.670> wow<00:00:48.820> the<00:00:49.180> match<00:00:49.329> is<00:00:49.510> over

that was fun you essentially deprive the
other<00:00:52.449> team<00:00:52.629> of<00:00:52.750> respawns<00:00:53.170> so<00:00:53.530> what

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:11.890 
weekend trying to capture an AI and hold

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:14.249 
weekend trying to capture an AI and hold
it<00:01:12.009> right<00:01:12.160> we<00:01:12.729> changed<00:01:13.060> that<00:01:13.179> so<00:01:13.390> it's<00:01:13.750> capture

00:01:14.249 --> 00:01:14.259 
it right we changed that so it's capture

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:16.380 
it right we changed that so it's capture
the<00:01:14.380> leader<00:01:14.500> so<00:01:15.100> one<00:01:15.340> player<00:01:15.550> on<00:01:15.759> the<00:01:15.850> COG<00:01:16.030> is

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:16.390 
the leader so one player on the COG is

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:18.210 
the leader so one player on the COG is
chairman<00:01:16.929> Prescott<00:01:17.110> player<00:01:17.740> on<00:01:17.830> the<00:01:17.920> locus

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:18.220 
chairman Prescott player on the locus

chairman Prescott player on the locus
this<00:01:18.399> Queen<00:01:18.580> mira<00:01:18.789> spawn<00:01:19.630> basically<00:01:20.140> have<00:01:20.259> to

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:20.320 
this Queen mira spawn basically have to

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.080 
this Queen mira spawn basically have to
capital<00:01:20.770> e<00:01:20.830> to<00:01:20.950> take<00:01:21.399> him<00:01:21.520> hostage<00:01:21.610> and<00:01:21.970> take

00:01:23.279 --> 00:01:23.289 
them somewhere in the map just hang on

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:24.419 
them somewhere in the map just hang on
for<00:01:23.320> a<00:01:23.679> certain<00:01:23.890> amount<00:01:23.920> of<00:01:24.070> time<00:01:24.190> which<00:01:24.399> is

00:01:24.419 --> 00:01:24.429 
for a certain amount of time which is

00:01:24.429 --> 00:01:26.609 
for a certain amount of time which is
proving<00:01:24.640> to<00:01:24.789> be<00:01:24.850> quite<00:01:25.149> a<00:01:25.479> bit<00:01:25.600> of<00:01:25.690> fun<00:01:25.810> on<00:01:26.409> top

00:01:26.609 --> 00:01:26.619 
proving to be quite a bit of fun on top

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:27.840 
proving to be quite a bit of fun on top
of<00:01:26.740> it<00:01:26.830> all<00:01:26.890> we<00:01:27.039> used<00:01:27.159> to<00:01:27.220> have<00:01:27.310> modes<00:01:27.520> like<00:01:27.580> an

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:27.850 
of it all we used to have modes like an

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:29.550 
of it all we used to have modes like an
X<00:01:28.030> where<00:01:28.210> was<00:01:28.330> kind<00:01:28.479> of<00:01:28.509> a<00:01:28.630> territory<00:01:29.170> control

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:29.560 
X where was kind of a territory control

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:30.749 
X where was kind of a territory control
mode<00:01:29.770> and<00:01:29.920> things<00:01:30.069> like<00:01:30.159> that<00:01:30.220> and<00:01:30.460> it<00:01:30.550> kind<00:01:30.700> of

00:01:30.749 --> 00:01:30.759 
mode and things like that and it kind of

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:31.889 
mode and things like that and it kind of
was<00:01:30.880> little<00:01:31.090> fuzzy<00:01:31.390> as<00:01:31.450> far<00:01:31.630> as<00:01:31.690> what<00:01:31.840> the

00:01:31.889 --> 00:01:31.899 
was little fuzzy as far as what the

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:33.870 
was little fuzzy as far as what the
rules<00:01:32.110> were<00:01:32.229> we've<00:01:32.890> consolidated<00:01:33.220> and<00:01:33.640> change

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:33.880 
rules were we've consolidated and change

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:35.609 
rules were we've consolidated and change
that<00:01:34.060> modified<00:01:34.509> and<00:01:34.690> streamlined<00:01:35.170> it<00:01:35.319> into<00:01:35.590> a

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:35.619 
that modified and streamlined it into a

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:38.100 
that modified and streamlined it into a
mode<00:01:35.860> that's<00:01:36.100> essentially<00:01:36.909> a<00:01:37.210> territory<00:01:37.929> base

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:38.110 
mode that's essentially a territory base

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:40.050 
mode that's essentially a territory base
mode<00:01:38.380> where<00:01:38.649> it's<00:01:38.770> king<00:01:38.920> of<00:01:39.009> the<00:01:39.069> hill<00:01:39.190> so<00:01:39.670> find

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:40.060 
mode where it's king of the hill so find

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:41.820 
mode where it's king of the hill so find
the<00:01:40.149> circle<00:01:40.509> hold<00:01:40.690> it<00:01:40.840> sapan<00:01:41.410> of<00:01:41.470> the<00:01:41.530> points

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:41.830 
the circle hold it sapan of the points

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:43.050 
the circle hold it sapan of the points
get<00:01:41.979> a<00:01:42.009> certain<00:01:42.280> percentage<00:01:42.580> point<00:01:42.819> to<00:01:42.910> win

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:43.060 
get a certain percentage point to win

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:44.100 
get a certain percentage point to win
and<00:01:43.330> then<00:01:43.420> it<00:01:43.509> moves<00:01:43.690> to<00:01:43.810> another<00:01:43.869> location

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:44.110 
and then it moves to another location

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:46.050 
and then it moves to another location
which<00:01:44.560> is<00:01:44.590> provided<00:01:45.130> some<00:01:45.280> very<00:01:45.429> strategic<00:01:45.910> in

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:46.060 
which is provided some very strategic in

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:47.880

people<00:03:49.600> earn<00:03:49.780> them<00:03:49.959> back<00:03:50.140> so<00:03:50.410> we<00:03:50.500> basically

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:52.870 
pulled all the executions away and then

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:54.240

takes<00:06:50.819> a<00:06:50.879> lot<00:06:50.909> of<00:06:50.999> work<00:06:51.149> and<00:06:51.360> it<00:06:51.449> takes<00:06:51.479> time

00:06:51.799 --> 00:06:51.809 
takes a lot of work and it takes time

00:06:51.809 --> 00:06:53.779 
takes a lot of work and it takes time
and<00:06:51.869> so<00:06:52.199> that<00:06:52.499> extra<00:06:52.829> five<00:06:53.009> months<00:06:53.279> you<00:06:53.699> know

00:06:53.779 --> 00:06:53.789 
and so that extra five months you know

00:06:53.789 --> 00:06:54.979 
and so that extra five months you know
in<00:06:54.029> that<00:06:54.149> time<00:06:54.360> period<00:06:54.389> we're<00:06:54.749> going<00:06:54.869> to<00:06:54.929> be

00:06:54.979 --> 00:06:54.989 
in that time period we're going to be

00:06:54.989 --> 00:06:56.359 
in that time period we're going to be
able<00:06:55.110> to<00:06:55.289> do<00:06:55.439> that<00:06:55.589> and<00:06:55.769> not<00:06:55.799> only<00:06:55.949> do<00:06:56.129> it<00:06:56.249> but

00:06:56.359 --> 00:06:56.369 
able to do that and not only do it but

00:06:56.369 --> 00:06:57.799 
able to do that and not only do it but
I'll<00:06:56.429> do<00:06:56.549> it<00:06:56.579> on<00:06:56.729> top<00:06:56.879> of<00:06:57.059> dedicated<00:06:57.479> servers

00:06:57.799 --> 00:06:57.809 
I'll do it on top of dedicated servers

00:06:57.809 --> 00:06:59.299 
I'll do it on top of dedicated servers
so<00:06:58.259> we<00:06:58.409> can<00:06:58.499> actually<00:06:58.589> really<00:06:58.949> test<00:06:59.189> the

00:06:59.299 --> 00:06:59.309 
so we can actually really test the

00:06:59.309 --> 00:07:01.339 
so we can actually really test the
scalability<00:07:00.029> and<00:07:00.149> are<00:07:00.689> the<00:07:00.809> data<00:07:00.929> centers<00:07:01.259> in

00:07:01.339 --> 00:07:01.349 
scalability and are the data centers in

00:07:01.349 --> 00:07:02.449 
scalability and are the data centers in
the<00:07:01.409> right<00:07:01.529> place<00:07:01.739> or<00:07:02.009> we<00:07:02.099> might<00:07:02.249> place

00:07:02.449 --> 00:07:02.459 
the right place or we might place

00:07:02.459 --> 00:07:04.429 
the right place or we might place
globally<00:07:02.759> all<00:07:03.149> that<00:07:03.300> kind<00:07:03.479> of<00:07:03.539> stuff<00:07:03.599> so<00:07:03.779> we're

00:07:04.429 --> 00:07:04.439 
globally all that kind of stuff so we're

00:07:04.439 --> 00:07:05.329 
globally all that kind of stuff so we're
really<00:07:04.559> looking<00:07:04.739> forward<00:07:05.039> to<00:07:05.099> having<00:07:05.189> a
