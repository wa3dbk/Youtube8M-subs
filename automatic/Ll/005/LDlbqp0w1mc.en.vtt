at<00:00:26.529> first<00:00:26.770> I<00:00:27.070> put<00:00:27.220> on<00:00:27.340> it<00:00:27.460> I<00:00:27.489> did<00:00:27.730> struggle<00:00:27.970> with

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:28.300 
at first I put on it I did struggle with

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:31.950 
at first I put on it I did struggle with
this<00:00:28.509> and<00:00:28.960> putting<00:00:29.739> out<00:00:29.919> Liars<00:00:30.360> but<00:00:31.360> I<00:00:31.570> think

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:31.960 
this and putting out Liars but I think

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:33.210 
this and putting out Liars but I think
is<00:00:32.169> just<00:00:32.500> about<00:00:32.649> getting<00:00:32.800> used<00:00:33.070> to<00:00:33.130> the

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:33.220 
is just about getting used to the

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:34.860 
is just about getting used to the
technique<00:00:33.579> because<00:00:33.910> it<00:00:33.940> is<00:00:34.149> pretty<00:00:34.570> different

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:34.870 
technique because it is pretty different

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:37.620 
technique because it is pretty different
to<00:00:35.230> other<00:00:35.380> pushers<00:00:35.739> I've<00:00:35.980> used<00:00:36.220> so<00:00:37.149> basically

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:37.630 
to other pushers I've used so basically

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:40.400 
to other pushers I've used so basically
the<00:00:37.810> pushing<00:00:38.200> this<00:00:38.320> button<00:00:38.530> here<00:00:39.149> you<00:00:40.149> then

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
the pushing this button here you then

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.790 
the pushing this button here you then
push<00:00:41.410> down<00:00:41.440> on<00:00:41.680> this<00:00:43.199> we<00:00:44.199> should<00:00:44.350> point<00:00:44.500> down

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:44.800 
push down on this we should point down

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:48.509 
push down on this we should point down
and<00:00:45.100> then<00:00:45.670> it<00:00:45.760> all<00:00:45.879> clicks<00:00:46.120> into<00:00:46.390> play<00:00:46.949> okay<00:00:47.949> so

00:00:48.509 --> 00:00:48.519 
and then it all clicks into play okay so

00:00:48.519 --> 00:00:52.020 
and then it all clicks into play okay so
that's<00:00:48.730> the<00:00:49.269> pushchair<00:00:49.510> fully<00:00:50.289> erect<00:00:50.590> now<00:00:51.030> you

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:52.030 
that's the pushchair fully erect now you

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:53.790 
that's the pushchair fully erect now you
will<00:00:52.239> be<00:00:52.359> noticing<00:00:52.989> that<00:00:53.230> the<00:00:53.350> handlebars

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:30.330 
something I had to hunt down for it
actually<00:01:28.420> hidden<00:01:28.660> underneath<00:01:29.470> this<00:01:29.860> here<00:01:30.160> so

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:30.340 
actually hidden underneath this here so

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:32.760 
actually hidden underneath this here so
when<00:01:30.850> I<00:01:30.880> read<00:01:31.060> it<00:01:31.390> there's<00:01:31.720> actually<00:01:31.870> metal

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:32.770 
when I read it there's actually metal

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:36.170 
when I read it there's actually metal
bar<00:01:32.920> there<00:01:34.080> okay<00:01:35.080> so<00:01:35.140> if<00:01:35.470> you<00:01:35.590> squeeze<00:01:35.890> that

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
bar there okay so if you squeeze that

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.910 
bar there okay so if you squeeze that
you<00:01:37.180> can<00:01:37.390> put<00:01:37.570> it<00:01:37.660> right<00:01:37.780> down<00:01:37.960> so<00:01:38.500> it<00:01:38.620> reclines

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:38.920 
you can put it right down so it reclines

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:43.620 
you can put it right down so it reclines
completely<00:01:39.400> flat<00:01:40.770> or<00:01:41.770> you<00:01:41.830> can<00:01:42.760> put<00:01:43.000> up<00:01:43.300> a<00:01:43.420> knot

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:48.690 
completely flat or you can put up a knot
so<00:01:44.020> it's<00:01:44.920> slightly<00:01:45.850> reclined<00:01:46.710> or<00:01:47.710> you<00:01:48.520> can

hideaway umbrella the kids feet and

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.270 
hideaway umbrella the kids feet and
because<00:02:10.090> the<00:02:10.239> hood<00:02:10.450> is<00:02:10.599> so<00:02:10.780> large<00:02:11.280> they

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
because the hood is so large they

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.070 
because the hood is so large they
decided<00:02:12.790> that<00:02:12.819> we<00:02:13.060> didn't<00:02:13.330> need<00:02:13.569> a<00:02:13.599> full<00:02:13.930> rain

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
decided that we didn't need a full rain

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.480 
decided that we didn't need a full rain
cover<00:02:14.379> and<00:02:14.770> I<00:02:15.730> mean<00:02:15.970> it<00:02:16.090> would<00:02:16.270> cover<00:02:16.870> Leos

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:18.490 
cover and I mean it would cover Leos

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:20.940 
cover and I mean it would cover Leos
