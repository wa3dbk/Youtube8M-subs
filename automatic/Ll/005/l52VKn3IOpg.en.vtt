00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:07.109
 Since 1991, the cadet is no longer called 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:09.599
 Cadet but astra this one is here 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:11.250
 Representatives of the tenth generation 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.830
 and he is one of the faster ones 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.920
 Sprouts, after all, already 78 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:19.289
 year old family history in astra gtc 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.689
 opel replaces the family tree now 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:24.449
 a new motor the young wild should 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:26.430
 be a sports car with pure passion 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.880
 visually it differs but 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.529
 hardly from his weaker siblings 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:35.160
 The difference is the sporty ones 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:38.370
 under the bonnet a 200 hp gasoline engine 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:42.840
 accelerates the gtc standard consumption aloud 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:46.170
 he is 66 liters up to 230 km h 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:49.670
 fast with scarcely 25,000 euro is the 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.670
 astra affordable 

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:59.090
 So what I'm really pleased there 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:01.880
 a new engine for the opel gtc im 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:04.520
 summer say really firm were the 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:08.090
 unfortunately not yet this one 

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:11.510
 1.6 liter turbo with 200 ps and 300 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.610
 Newtonmeter would say that could 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:15.590
 I really fit well 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:17.800
 that 's how it works in less than eight seconds 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:20.570
 zero to 100 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:23.330
 I noticed boost pressure builds up so 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:26.030
 slow on previously authorized initially 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:28.760
 but then distributed nice moment 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:32.090
 Who about speed belt in total for 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:33.560
 not really pleasant mother he will 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:37.070
 not very hectic now and not 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:39.440
 I like that last 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:42.430
 and this fits the sporty too 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:42.430
 landing gear 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:49.049
 Opel calls the front suspension 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:50.540
 hiperstrut what does that mean if i did 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:54.330
 give in now 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:56.040
 then the fall of the 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:59.190
 usually by turning in the wheel 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:01.020
 on kicking the wheel stands with more surface 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:02.330
 on the ground that means it can be more powerful 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.190
 be transmitted 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:07.590
 so far less understeer in the 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:09.780
 curve so you can theoretically fast 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.800
 drive around the bend and practical 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.020
 it really works 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.850
 Great thing to me in this 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:17.130
 I really like the connection 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:19.590
 we now have an adjustable one 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:21.660
 Chassis on sport on tour you can 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.790
 drive tour also a bit more comfortable 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:25.489
 Sport for some hits but even on 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:28.050
 It does not get much sport 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:30.050
 uncomfortable so a worthy 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:33.989
 representative of the athletic 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:35.880
 Family tradition even draws a pen 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:38.850
 he class what more could you want 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:41.400
 it can not get any better , but it does 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:44.100
 Car would be better as much as pretty much 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.330
 So less weight would just be better 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:47.040
 also in the sense of sportiness 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.299
 of course also in terms of consumption 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.190
 pretty much everything for less 

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:51.900
 weight but unfortunately he does not learn it 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:54.450
 to make the car easier 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:58.370
 that must be the new brother in 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.370
 to take over the next generations
