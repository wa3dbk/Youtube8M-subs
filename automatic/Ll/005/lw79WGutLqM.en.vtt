00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.300
 These are my two oil lamps 

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:13.799
 this one is from Yugoslavia around 1940 

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:21.240
 this is a lamp construction sites a 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:23.279
 replica of those around 1920 to the end of the 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.949
 second world war were in use or 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:34.790
 even longer 

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:38.730
 The lake is from the Czech Republic and from 1980 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:40.800
 to put it here in operation that 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.620
 it's the cluster from 1 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:47.120
 [Music] 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:47.120
 and then light it there 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:10.570
 and here you have to lift all this 

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:14.720
 and then charge them under fire 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:17.690
 he is kindled like one certainly 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:22.570
 The flame has already been seen 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:22.570
 Both lamps regulators 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:27.629
 [Applause] 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:43.440
 fires fabric petroleum and yes if the 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:49.600
 tank is filled 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:52.030
 then they run around six hours 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:02:01.509
 but I have not yet 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:02:07.090
 Tried out who the lamp can be here 

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:09.869
 to lift and carry or somewhere 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:09.869
 moor 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:23.880
 and is a mirror attached and that 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.880
 light to do something more 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:29.420
 The spot 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:40.510
 sometimes again against this 

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:44.190
 because the wick refilled but 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:44.190
 then someday would have to go out
