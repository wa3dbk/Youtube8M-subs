00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:12.630
 it is a tool carrier and you would like that 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.370
 being able to do well in dutch is 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.690
 a large machine that lands on it 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.730
 arable farm or vegetable chill 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.140
 companies are used and with which all 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.349
 care work can be done 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:20.820
 to become 

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:22.860
 so actually a replacement for the 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.779
 classic draw it is incredibly do 

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:27.270
 it is now that you can finish even more 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.489
 This is the world's first one 

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:31.560
 electric tractor on this scale 

00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:32.820
 and we don't just have the drive 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.350
 made electrically we also have it 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.880
 overall concept of the tractor does not drive 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.410
 turned inside out because this one 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.120
 tractor has a whole on the inside 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.460
 plenty of room for tools and tom 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.769
 while a regular tractor of the 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.260
 inside is completely full with mega de 

00:00:43.769 --> 00:00:47.910
 shape of the machine is now the fact that 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.730
 he prepared the track a variable can 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:53.629
 between three meters 25 and 2 meters 25 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:56.550
 the length of the machine making all 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:57.929
 tools in fact also under the 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.940
 machine can hang instead of too 

00:00:57.929 --> 00:01:02.159
 in front and behind the tractor 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.780
 made up of four very large wheels that 

00:01:02.159 --> 00:01:06.570
 all four are powered separately 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.830
 electrically and also sent separately 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.750
 and there is a whole between those four wheels 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.220
 high and large frame through which you 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.409
 have so many options 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.659
 in front of the tractor in the middle and on 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.290
 the back of your tools than 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.880
 worked 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.549
 the machine is driven by 4 wheel 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.530
 must do that are 22 pounds what that is 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.299
 about 30 hp but you can 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.950
 briefly and then we talk about one 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.750
 minute or five to ten 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.130
 double taxed and that is also something I do 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.299
 just a tractor can't you can you 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.770
 just the arjan that is twice as heavy 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:34.020
 taxed story 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.579
 and this machine you can then use one 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.100
 ability to give everything later 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:39.240
 250 hp each other 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.130
 and that is incredibly much the case 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.270
 machine and that electricity you come 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.369
 partly from the battery pack that says 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.899
 on the back of the machine and at the front 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.090
 stands a diesel engine with a weapon 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:50.100
 so if a lot of power is needed or if 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.420
 the battery is empty then start the diesel engine 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.619
 and then you can just go through work because one 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.250
 things have you over an hour a day 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.500
 to work 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.689
 This machine has been developed from a whole 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.359
 strong cooperation between 7 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:01.680
 arable farmers on one side and two 

00:01:59.359 --> 00:02:03.539
 producers and our own company 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.159
 design company on the other hand and 

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:08.610
 especially that combination of practice 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:10.770
 knowledge and expertise and the building 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.690
 of tools that is a very beautiful one 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.940
 mix which we use this machine 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.950
 could 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.810
 this one is almost finished by practice 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.580
 so that is about a month or 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:19.750
 he goes out into the field for about six weeks 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:21.250
 extensively tested 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:23.410
 these are the first models we have 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:24.970
 so naturally there is 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:26.380
 there is progressive insight and we go there 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:28.720
 what things do differently next time 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:30.880
 but the main part of the of the form the 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.900
 concept of the machine that is according to 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:34.230
 I still need that 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.230
 government
