this<00:00:11.030> is<00:00:11.209> the<00:00:11.360> print<00:00:11.750> that<00:00:11.990> I'm<00:00:12.110> going<00:00:12.379> to<00:00:12.559> be

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:12.680 
this is the print that I'm going to be

rendering on the swimsuit see it's quite
a<00:00:15.619> large<00:00:15.949> print<00:00:16.480> so<00:00:17.480> I've<00:00:17.599> reduced<00:00:18.050> it<00:00:18.380> to

00:00:18.669 --> 00:00:18.679 
a large print so I've reduced it to

00:00:18.679 --> 00:00:22.570 
a large print so I've reduced it to
about<00:00:19.640> 20%<00:00:20.480> of<00:00:20.570> its<00:00:20.750> size<00:00:21.130> that<00:00:22.130> gives<00:00:22.339> me<00:00:22.550> a

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:22.580 
about 20% of its size that gives me a

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:27.070 
about 20% of its size that gives me a
guide<00:00:22.910> for<00:00:23.539> my<00:00:23.660> rendering

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:27.080
