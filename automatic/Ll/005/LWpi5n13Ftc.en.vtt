00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
smart phone or iPod touch around so you

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.840 
smart phone or iPod touch around so you
get<00:01:03.239> pretty<00:01:03.629> much<00:01:03.809> that<00:01:04.409> perfect<00:01:05.039> camera<00:01:05.489> shot

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850

and<00:01:06.479> you<00:01:06.899> can't<00:01:07.139> loosen<00:01:07.319> it<00:01:07.529> tighten<00:01:07.889> it<00:01:07.979> so<00:01:08.420> it

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
and you can't loosen it tighten it so it

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.300 
and you can't loosen it tighten it so it
won't<00:01:09.749> follow<00:01:09.990> us<00:01:10.109> off<00:01:10.319> and<00:01:10.560> you<00:01:10.799> can't<00:01:11.069> take

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310

off that part and put on another tripod
I<00:01:13.380> guess<00:01:13.709> the<00:01:13.829> reason<00:01:13.950> they<00:01:14.159> did<00:01:14.369> that<00:01:14.399> because

00:01:14.809 --> 00:01:14.819 
I guess the reason they did that because

00:01:14.819 --> 00:01:17.779 
I guess the reason they did that because
they<00:01:15.119> didn't<00:01:15.479> want<00:01:15.630> this<00:01:15.840> this<00:01:16.590> tripod<00:01:17.490> is<00:01:17.609> not
