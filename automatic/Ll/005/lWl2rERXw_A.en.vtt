good<00:00:00.420> morning<00:00:00.920> it's<00:00:01.920> october<00:00:02.429> 19th<00:00:03.110> 2014<00:00:04.250> and

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:05.250 
good morning it's october 19th 2014 and

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.410 
good morning it's october 19th 2014 and
well<00:00:06.180> it's<00:00:06.420> still<00:00:06.600> kind<00:00:07.109> of<00:00:07.200> dark<00:00:08.269> it's<00:00:09.269> a

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
well it's still kind of dark it's a

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.400 
well it's still kind of dark it's a
little<00:00:09.540> after<00:00:10.080> seven<00:00:10.530> eight<00:00:10.740> m<00:00:11.960> and<00:00:12.960> I<00:00:13.139> was

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
little after seven eight m and I was

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.400 
little after seven eight m and I was
kind<00:00:13.650> of<00:00:13.769> hoping<00:00:13.860> that<00:00:14.460> um<00:00:14.960> it<00:00:15.960> would<00:00:16.199> be<00:00:16.379> a

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
kind of hoping that um it would be a

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.460 
kind of hoping that um it would be a
little<00:00:16.740> brighter<00:00:17.039> by<00:00:17.670> the<00:00:17.730> time<00:00:18.090> I<00:00:18.240> started

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:18.470 
little brighter by the time I started

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:22.310 
little brighter by the time I started
recording<00:00:19.470> this<00:00:20.689> so<00:00:21.689> that<00:00:21.900> there<00:00:22.080> would<00:00:22.289> be

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
recording this so that there would be

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.830 
recording this so that there would be
light<00:00:22.740> for<00:00:23.189> the<00:00:23.460> UM<00:00:24.380> camcorder<00:00:25.380> but<00:00:26.720> yeah<00:00:27.720> it's

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
light for the UM camcorder but yeah it's

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:34.280 
light for the UM camcorder but yeah it's
still<00:00:28.109> dark<00:00:29.779> so<00:00:30.800> hopefully<00:00:31.800> I'm<00:00:33.079> the<00:00:34.079> light

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
still dark so hopefully I'm the light

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:40.540 
still dark so hopefully I'm the light
will<00:00:34.590> improve<00:00:35.070> as<00:00:35.370> I<00:00:36.800> record<00:00:37.800> this<00:00:39.260> we'll<00:00:40.260> see

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:40.550 
will improve as I record this we'll see

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:44.119 
will improve as I record this we'll see
well<00:00:41.550> some<00:00:42.300> people<00:00:42.690> apparently<00:00:43.559> want<00:00:44.010> to

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
well some people apparently want to

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.869 
well some people apparently want to
revise<00:00:44.690> the<00:00:45.690> exit<00:00:46.140> exams<00:00:46.680> for<00:00:47.219> American<00:00:47.670> high

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
revise the exit exams for American high

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.900 
revise the exit exams for American high
school<00:00:48.239> students<00:00:48.800> to<00:00:49.800> make<00:00:49.950> them<00:00:50.129> easier<00:00:50.610> for

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
school students to make them easier for

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.970 
school students to make them easier for
the<00:00:51.059> other<00:00:51.300> students<00:00:51.719> to<00:00:51.930> pass<00:00:52.199> and<00:00:52.730> graduate

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:54.980 
the other students to pass and graduate

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:59.450 
the other students to pass and graduate
I'm<00:00:55.980> not<00:00:56.280> sure<00:00:56.340> if<00:00:56.760> I'm<00:00:57.800> dumbing<00:00:58.800> down<00:00:58.980> the

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
I'm not sure if I'm dumbing down the

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.799 
I'm not sure if I'm dumbing down the
exit<00:00:59.820> exams<00:01:00.239> is<00:01:00.719> really<00:01:01.260> a<00:01:01.289> good<00:01:01.590> idea<00:01:02.809> because

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
exit exams is really a good idea because

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:10.060 
exit exams is really a good idea because
I'm<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:04.559> American<00:01:05.040> education<00:01:05.159> system<00:01:07.070> well<00:01:08.070> I

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:10.070 
I'm the American education system well I

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:12.920 
I'm the American education system well I
won't<00:01:11.070> go<00:01:11.220> into<00:01:11.250> that<00:01:11.490> but<00:01:12.240> um<00:01:12.450> it's<00:01:12.689> not

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
won't go into that but um it's not

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.929 
won't go into that but um it's not
exactly<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.920> best<00:01:14.610> in<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.090> world<00:01:16.100> and<00:01:17.100> some

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
exactly the best in the world and some

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.780 
exactly the best in the world and some
people<00:01:18.119> even<00:01:18.450> want<00:01:18.840> to<00:01:19.020> get<00:01:19.740> rid<00:01:20.070> of<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:20.430> exit

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
people even want to get rid of the exit

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.570 
people even want to get rid of the exit
exams<00:01:21.830> so<00:01:22.830> that<00:01:23.130> um<00:01:23.450> students<00:01:24.450> won't<00:01:24.600> have<00:01:24.930> a

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:25.580 
exams so that um students won't have a

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:30.469 
exams so that um students won't have a
hard<00:01:26.580> time<00:01:26.900> graduating<00:01:28.880> but<00:01:29.880> I<00:01:29.939> think<00:01:30.360> a

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
hard time graduating but I think a

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.710 
hard time graduating but I think a
better<00:01:30.720> solution<00:01:31.729> would<00:01:32.729> be<00:01:32.790> to<00:01:33.000> do<00:01:33.450> a<00:01:33.479> better

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
better solution would be to do a better

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.580 
better solution would be to do a better
job<00:01:33.840> at<00:01:34.290> teaching<00:01:35.659> instead<00:01:36.659> of<00:01:36.810> just<00:01:37.049> trying

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
job at teaching instead of just trying

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.520 
job at teaching instead of just trying
to<00:01:37.710> find<00:01:37.920> ways<00:01:38.450> to<00:01:39.450> make<00:01:39.630> it<00:01:39.780> easier<00:01:40.229> for

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
to find ways to make it easier for

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.910 
to find ways to make it easier for
students<00:01:41.340> to<00:01:41.689> graduate<00:01:42.689> who<00:01:43.939> might<00:01:44.939> not<00:01:45.210> know

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:45.920 
students to graduate who might not know

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.020 
students to graduate who might not know
as<00:01:46.920> much<00:01:46.950> as<00:01:47.220> they<00:01:47.640> should

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:49.030 
as much as they should

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:53.340 
as much as they should
so<00:01:50.020> on<00:01:51.000> yeah<00:01:52.000> hopefully<00:01:52.270> all<00:01:52.659> of<00:01:52.690> that<00:01:53.020> stuff

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:53.350 
so on yeah hopefully all of that stuff

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:59.130 
so on yeah hopefully all of that stuff
will<00:01:54.600> work<00:01:55.600> out<00:01:55.869> for<00:01:56.140> the<00:01:56.979> best<00:01:57.280> and<00:01:58.000> I<00:01:58.659> think<00:01:59.020> a

00:01:59.130 --> 00:01:59.140 
will work out for the best and I think a

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:01.100 
will work out for the best and I think a
better<00:01:59.320> way<00:01:59.530> to<00:01:59.560> actually<00:02:00.100> teach<00:02:00.369> students

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
better way to actually teach students

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.480 
better way to actually teach students
would<00:02:02.110> be<00:02:02.320> to<00:02:02.530> teach<00:02:02.770> them<00:02:03.070> in<00:02:03.220> a<00:02:03.310> way<00:02:03.460> that

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:03.490 
would be to teach them in a way that

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:08.100 
would be to teach them in a way that
actually<00:02:04.409> inspires<00:02:05.409> them<00:02:05.770> and<00:02:06.729> not<00:02:07.659> just

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.110 
actually inspires them and not just

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:15.360 
actually inspires them and not just
teach<00:02:08.649> from<00:02:09.100> the<00:02:09.310> book<00:02:09.660> and<00:02:12.000> maybe<00:02:14.370> teachers

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
teach from the book and maybe teachers

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:19.790 
teach from the book and maybe teachers
could<00:02:16.410> turn<00:02:17.410> lessons<00:02:17.920> into<00:02:18.130> kind<00:02:18.489> of<00:02:18.580> a<00:02:18.700> story

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
could turn lessons into kind of a story

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:24.509 
could turn lessons into kind of a story
or<00:02:20.800> maybe<00:02:21.250> have<00:02:21.610> some<00:02:21.880> more<00:02:22.110> hands-on<00:02:23.519> things

00:02:24.509 --> 00:02:24.519 
or maybe have some more hands-on things

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:30.690 
or maybe have some more hands-on things
to<00:02:25.269> do<00:02:26.820> or<00:02:27.820> maybe<00:02:28.090> take<00:02:28.420> more<00:02:28.720> fuel<00:02:29.110> trips<00:02:29.700> and

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
to do or maybe take more fuel trips and

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:35.100 
to do or maybe take more fuel trips and
just<00:02:31.630> general<00:02:32.140> stuff<00:02:32.170> like<00:02:32.680> that<00:02:33.900> that<00:02:34.900> way

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
just general stuff like that that way

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:37.320 
just general stuff like that that way
the<00:02:35.319> students<00:02:35.680> might<00:02:35.980> actually<00:02:36.400> learn

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330 
the students might actually learn

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:40.590 
the students might actually learn
background<00:02:38.230> and<00:02:38.850> would<00:02:39.850> be<00:02:40.060> able<00:02:40.090> to<00:02:40.510> actually

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:40.600 
background and would be able to actually

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:46.009 
background and would be able to actually
graduate<00:02:42.959> whether<00:02:43.959> passing<00:02:44.769> the<00:02:44.920> exit<00:02:45.069> exams

00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:46.019 
graduate whether passing the exit exams

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:49.850 
graduate whether passing the exit exams
instead<00:02:47.019> of<00:02:47.050> just<00:02:47.380> teaching<00:02:47.970> from<00:02:48.970> the<00:02:49.209> book

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
instead of just teaching from the book

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:54.600 
instead of just teaching from the book
without<00:02:50.860> the<00:02:51.250> exit<00:02:51.580> exams<00:02:52.590> which<00:02:53.590> is<00:02:54.100> kind<00:02:54.519> of

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 
without the exit exams which is kind of

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:57.350 
without the exit exams which is kind of
a<00:02:54.700> lazy<00:02:54.940> way<00:02:55.299> to<00:02:55.329> do<00:02:55.630> it<00:02:55.810> but<00:02:56.590> if<00:02:56.650> your<00:02:56.950> teacher

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
a lazy way to do it but if your teacher

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.319 
a lazy way to do it but if your teacher
you<00:02:58.360> should<00:02:58.390> actually<00:02:58.720> want<00:02:59.260> to<00:02:59.470> actually

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:00.329 
you should actually want to actually

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:03.930 
you should actually want to actually
make<00:03:01.329> this<00:03:01.540> students<00:03:02.049> learn<00:03:02.560> things<00:03:03.400> and

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940 
make this students learn things and

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:07.020 
make this students learn things and
retain<00:03:04.780> what<00:03:05.049> they<00:03:05.230> learn<00:03:05.470> well<00:03:06.459> Nicholas

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030 
retain what they learn well Nicholas

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:09.180 
retain what they learn well Nicholas

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:09.190 
Brendan who played Xander on Buffy the

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:12.780 
Brendan who played Xander on Buffy the
Vampire<00:03:09.400> Slayer<00:03:10.500> was<00:03:11.500> apparently<00:03:12.190> arrested

Vampire Slayer was apparently arrested

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:15.240 
Vampire Slayer was apparently arrested
because<00:03:13.540> I<00:03:14.019> guess<00:03:14.200> he<00:03:14.380> was<00:03:14.530> a<00:03:14.560> little<00:03:14.980> drunk

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250 
because I guess he was a little drunk

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:18.870 
because I guess he was a little drunk
and<00:03:15.750> I<00:03:16.750> think<00:03:17.110> he<00:03:17.200> was<00:03:17.350> in<00:03:17.500> a<00:03:17.620> hotel<00:03:18.010> lobby<00:03:18.579> or

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:18.880 
and I think he was in a hotel lobby or

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.080 
and I think he was in a hotel lobby or
something<00:03:19.410> and<00:03:20.410> there<00:03:21.040> was<00:03:21.130> an<00:03:21.280> argument<00:03:21.489> and

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090 
something and there was an argument and

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:26.009 
something and there was an argument and
he<00:03:22.150> ended<00:03:22.930> up<00:03:23.019> breaking<00:03:23.380> something<00:03:24.600> and<00:03:25.600> the

00:03:26.009 --> 00:03:26.019 
he ended up breaking something and the

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:28.460 
he ended up breaking something and the
police<00:03:26.260> were<00:03:26.530> called<00:03:26.769> in<00:03:27.250> while<00:03:27.549> they<00:03:27.790> were

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
police were called in while they were

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:32.759 
police were called in while they were
talking<00:03:29.470> to<00:03:29.829> witnesses<00:03:30.010> he<00:03:31.350> tried<00:03:32.350> to<00:03:32.500> get<00:03:32.620> up

00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:32.769 
talking to witnesses he tried to get up

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:38.039 
talking to witnesses he tried to get up
and<00:03:32.950> leave<00:03:33.780> and<00:03:35.910> well<00:03:36.910> he<00:03:36.940> was<00:03:37.239> arrested<00:03:37.480> for<00:03:37.989> I

00:03:38.039 --> 00:03:38.049 
and leave and well he was arrested for I

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:41.729 
and leave and well he was arrested for I
think<00:03:38.670> damaged<00:03:39.670> property<00:03:40.390> and<00:03:40.739> resisting

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:41.739 
think damaged property and resisting

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:45.960 
think damaged property and resisting
arrest<00:03:42.660> but<00:03:43.660> he<00:03:43.870> wasn't<00:03:44.079> a<00:03:44.440> in<00:03:44.890> jail<00:03:45.640> for<00:03:45.880> that

arrest but he wasn't a in jail for that

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:49.830 
arrest but he wasn't a in jail for that
long<00:03:46.209> I<00:03:46.739> think<00:03:47.739> it<00:03:47.859> was<00:03:47.890> less<00:03:48.220> than<00:03:48.250> I<00:03:48.940> guess<00:03:49.329> 24

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:49.840 
long I think it was less than I guess 24

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:53.690 
long I think it was less than I guess 24
hours<00:03:50.230> i'm<00:03:50.859> not<00:03:51.070> sure<00:03:51.310> but<00:03:51.959> on

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
hours i'm not sure but on

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:57.680 
hours i'm not sure but on

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:57.690 
yeah he was arrested and he was arrested

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:01.040 
yeah he was arrested and he was arrested
before<00:03:58.080> I<00:03:58.769> don't<00:03:59.400> remember<00:03:59.580> what<00:04:00.000> for<00:04:00.330> but<00:04:00.780> um

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:01.050 
before I don't remember what for but um

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:04.089 
before I don't remember what for but um
I<00:04:01.500> guess<00:04:02.459> it's<00:04:02.640> just<00:04:02.700> one<00:04:02.940> of<00:04:03.090> those<00:04:03.209> things

00:04:04.089 --> 00:04:04.099 
I guess it's just one of those things

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:07.040 
I guess it's just one of those things
and<00:04:05.099> uh<00:04:05.489> well<00:04:06.000> I<00:04:06.030> guess<00:04:06.300> that's<00:04:06.450> going<00:04:06.750> to<00:04:06.900> do

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:07.050 
and uh well I guess that's going to do

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:10.370 
and uh well I guess that's going to do
it<00:04:07.200> as<00:04:07.849> kind<00:04:08.849> of<00:04:08.970> a<00:04:09.090> correction<00:04:09.720> to<00:04:09.930> my<00:04:10.050> last

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:10.380 
it as kind of a correction to my last

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:12.800 
it as kind of a correction to my last
video<00:04:10.920> the<00:04:11.790> season<00:04:12.239> premiere<00:04:12.269> of

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810 
video the season premiere of

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:16.490 
video the season premiere of
supernatural<00:04:13.819> actually<00:04:14.819> aired<00:04:15.150> on<00:04:15.660> the<00:04:15.870> 7th

supernatural actually aired on the 7th

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.340 
supernatural actually aired on the 7th
