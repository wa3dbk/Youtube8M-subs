tree<00:02:21.700> tumble<00:02:22.390> when<00:02:22.600> he<00:02:22.690> goes<00:02:22.870> down<00:02:22.900> and<00:02:23.500> it

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
tree tumble when he goes down and it

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.520 
tree tumble when he goes down and it
assembles<00:02:24.340> pretty<00:02:24.580> easily<00:02:24.760> and<00:02:25.209> also<00:02:25.989> this

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
assembles pretty easily and also this

assembles pretty easily and also this
piece<00:02:26.769> right<00:02:26.950> here<00:02:27.010> and<00:02:27.310> you<00:02:27.370> can<00:02:27.580> connect

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
piece right here and you can connect

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.880 
piece right here and you can connect
this<00:02:28.150> with<00:02:28.360> all<00:02:28.630> the<00:02:29.050> taking<00:02:29.380> place<00:02:29.590> that's

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
this with all the taking place that's

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:36.120

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:38.490 
Bobby Wow Charlie all right Bobby let's
put<00:02:36.519> it<00:02:36.640> together<00:02:36.819> it's<00:02:37.660> rather<00:02:37.840> easy<00:02:37.959> to<00:02:38.350> put

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
put it together it's rather easy to put

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.610 
put it together it's rather easy to put
together<00:02:38.590> just<00:02:39.069> take<00:02:39.900> place<00:02:40.900> that<00:02:41.170> in<00:02:41.380> there

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
together just take place that in there

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:47.220 
together just take place that in there
so<00:02:44.190> I'm<00:02:45.190> gonna<00:02:45.340> press<00:02:45.670> down<00:02:45.730> and<00:02:46.450> that<00:02:46.900> links

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
so I'm gonna press down and that links

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:52.580 
so I'm gonna press down and that links
up<00:02:47.610> and<00:02:48.610> over<00:02:49.209> on<00:02:49.299> this<00:02:49.480> side<00:02:49.540> we<00:02:50.080> just<00:02:50.430> put

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
up and over on this side we just put

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:56.370 
up and over on this side we just put
this<00:02:53.590> piece<00:02:53.920> in<00:02:53.950> here<00:02:54.430> just<00:02:55.420> like<00:02:55.569> that

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:56.380 
this piece in here just like that

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:00.420 
this piece in here just like that
and<00:02:56.680> it<00:02:57.519> snaps<00:02:57.970> into<00:02:58.209> place<00:02:58.420> and<00:02:59.100> there<00:03:00.100> we<00:03:00.250> go

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
and it snaps into place and there we go

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.280 
and it snaps into place and there we go
we've<00:03:00.670> got<00:03:00.700> the<00:03:01.030> bashes<00:03:02.340> tree<00:03:03.340> tumble<00:03:03.730> set

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
we've got the bashes tree tumble set

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.509 
we've got the bashes tree tumble set
already<00:03:05.290> done<00:03:05.500> unless<00:03:05.829> may<00:03:06.040> show<00:03:06.220> you<00:03:06.280> how<00:03:06.400> it

we<00:03:08.920> take<00:03:09.340> this<00:03:09.609> little<00:03:09.850> piece<00:03:10.150> right<00:03:10.510> here

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
we take this little piece right here

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:15.420 
we take this little piece right here
slide<00:03:13.060> it<00:03:13.090> underneath<00:03:13.510> that<00:03:13.720> plastic<00:03:14.310> then<00:03:15.310> we

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
slide it underneath that plastic then we

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:18.920 
slide it underneath that plastic then we
put<00:03:15.850> this<00:03:15.970> up<00:03:16.209> to<00:03:16.420> hold<00:03:16.780> it<00:03:16.989> up<00:03:17.140> like<00:03:18.070> that<00:03:18.340> and

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
put this up to hold it up like that and

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:22.620 
put this up to hold it up like that and
I<00:03:19.930> try<00:03:20.260> it<00:03:20.320> this<00:03:20.470> way<00:03:20.790> they<00:03:21.790> take<00:03:22.000> a<00:03:22.030> bash<00:03:22.299> and

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:22.630 
I try it this way they take a bash and

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:25.170 
I try it this way they take a bash and
we<00:03:22.720> set<00:03:22.930> them<00:03:23.049> right<00:03:23.079> here<00:03:23.590> and<00:03:24.010> bash<00:03:24.850> goes

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:25.180 
we set them right here and bash goes

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:27.270 
we set them right here and bash goes
over<00:03:25.420> the<00:03:25.540> hill<00:03:25.750> and<00:03:26.049> down<00:03:26.260> into<00:03:26.620> a<00:03:26.650> forest<00:03:27.010> and

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 
over the hill and down into a forest and

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:30.240 
over the hill and down into a forest and
I<00:03:27.579> think<00:03:27.880> it's<00:03:28.030> trees<00:03:28.359> all<00:03:28.780> over<00:03:29.350> him<00:03:29.530> see

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 
I think it's trees all over him see

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:30.810 
I think it's trees all over him see
