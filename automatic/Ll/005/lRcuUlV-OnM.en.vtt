00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:16.340
 very good kids are 800 and I bring you 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:19.760
 a new video tutorial to make a 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:22.279
 hidden door of 1 x 2 is the most 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:23.990
 simple of all and this is a 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:25.490
 show was not going to change everything is 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:26.960
 put the shelf but good for not 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:29.300
 waste your time and it's largely 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:30.470
 same but good that in the end last and 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.210
 just put another part of here from 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:33.739
 shelves and good imagine since there 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:35.239
 shelves and you come to a room a 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:37.370
 obvious adventure map that is in your 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:39.110
 own house and there you want to make a 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:42.200
 hidden door is worth now none 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:45.019
 he knows where he is but if she goes out here 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:47.210
 the good door that nothing is something else 

00:00:45.019 --> 00:00:49.190
 that was making inconvenience since 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:51.980
 this door because nothing that you see 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:54.260
 pistons here but nothing more in super 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:56.660
 simple to do and nothing is done in two 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.850
 or three minutes the date has to start 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:00.980
 with the tutorial what we need is 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:02.550
 a wooden board dares a few 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:07.170
 wooden blocks 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:11.270
 reston torch repeats and laths 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.270
 sticky I'm going to do it here we are 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:18.990
 so we start making the framework worth 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:18.990
 we make a 1 x 2 frame 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:24.010
 those of height 1 of width is worth so that 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:26.680
 do not know 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:28.840
 we put the blocks in the block 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:30.160
 next where we have put can be 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.170
 put either side of the two in the 

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:35.890
 that one wants is worth I put in this 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:41.080
 side for example and we put 4 or 2 like this 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:43.390
 ok and here we put the wooden 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:45.700
 now the system we have to put a 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.860
 block that another here doing as well as 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:51.670
 a kind of 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:55.030
 in a kind of generated from let's say 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:57.210
 I'm here yes and we cover this part here 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:57.210
 over 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:05.420
 here we're going to make the corridor now 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:07.250
 that we are in a torch of rest in 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:10.569
 here for example 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:13.390
 if it looks anyway 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:16.749
 here we have to put a re peter to 4 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:19.719
 ticks is worth it here we put a 

00:02:16.749 --> 00:02:21.159
 golden point a little bit of rest and in this 

00:02:19.719 --> 00:02:22.599
 block from here that's going to be where it's going to 

00:02:21.159 --> 00:02:25.560
 be the torch that now after the 

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:27.810
 We place a put and 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:31.380
 we can do this to remove the 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:33.989
 the torch's momentum will then go 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:36.150
 here so bad as you see disabled 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:39.060
 others who have brought the two blocks have 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:40.709
 put these two pistons and both 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.910
 blocks that we have put here the have 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:44.489
 had speaker now we only need 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:46.380
 activate the other two and you make this 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:49.920
 way we return here the rest here and 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:52.910
 we make an ele and it would already be activated 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.910
 and why not 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:59.300
 it has not failed 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:07.920
 ah, it's worth being one failed 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:11.810
 here has to go a re peter 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.810
 and now yes and why not 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:18.030
 but I have technical failures 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:20.490
 now they had to update the block 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:22.740
 that's what I had failed good what 

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:24.120
 what we have to do now is the most 

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:25.500
 close that can be put is this has 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:28.860
 to be away because if you do not know 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:30.720
 only in the currents and here we could 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:34.730
 this is the same way to do it as 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.730
 I done here will put a wall 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.330
 maybe 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:50.959
 so for example this leftover so and here 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:52.250
 we could lever and now should a 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:53.930
 I play about this and good as I have 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:56.780
 said here you see here the two pistons 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:58.910
 but come on, that's almost inevitable 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:00.650
 not not find any door of 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:04.400
 moment that can be avoided to be seen 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:06.290
 the two blocks and nothing this is all 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.910
 tutorial vale I will leave the map in the 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:09.739
 good description added I have a map 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:12.739
 new because those are a project 

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:14.989
 that I have in hand and Estepona is a 

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:16.720
 nonsense voucher is badly done is not 

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:19.790
 well done only that is without privacy 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:21.079
 I will leave you this one already decorated with 

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:24.800
 bookshelf with a kind of room 

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:27.800
 with the secret door it's ok and I'll do it if 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:29.419
 will use in this same voucher and I think 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:31.520
 that is already so that nothing more kids 

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:33.669
 See you in the next video to 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:33.669
 then
