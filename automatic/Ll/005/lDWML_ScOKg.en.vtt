00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
 if you're new to triathlon and yours 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:05.490
 our swimming attentive to the next 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.259
 report we corrected the errors more 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.630
 common and we give you the keys to 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:12.500
 start swimming well and achieve the 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.500
 better results 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.860
 I'm Mariano Badía, I'm a trainer 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:39.970
 licensed national swimming 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:41.110
 sciences of physical activity and 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:43.300
 sport 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:45.770
 let's try to get rid of fear 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:48.440
 polishing the mistakes 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:50.840
 arise in swimming thinking about the 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.200
 world of triathlon beside me I have a 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.150
 ramón 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:57.570
 a triathlete or swim specialist 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:59.220
 that will help us improve these 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.850
 mistakes but maybe it's the sport that 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:05.160
 the less people practice or the more they 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.590
 it's hard to practice after all 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:08.610
 foot race or the bicycle the most 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.860
 that we have always practiced 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.600
 swimming is a segment that there are some 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.460
 but the majority that I find is 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.930
 people who do not practice much swimming 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.780
 and the little bit more when they come to 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.940
 try to face a triathlon think about 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.880
 they must swim in open water 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:26.460
 and swim surrounded by a lot of people and that 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.810
 it disturbs them and throws them back a 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.729
 little because as it is not a means that 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.740
 usually dominate one hundred percent that 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.450
 feeling of swimming in open water and 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.070
 with many people they are afraid when 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.760
 you feel competent in a 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.650
 discipline 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:40.510
 he feels confident in himself then 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:42.370
 that security makes those fears 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:44.620
 disappear there are two types of triathlon 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:46.690
 is that they are the short distance and the 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:49.950
 long distance does not cut them 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:51.280
 distance swimming has been a 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.810
 vital importance 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.640
 - of three in any of the 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:57.020
 triathlons sessions per week 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.310
 it is not advisable it is good with me 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.780
 I have two of the materials that we 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:02.610
 we found in the world of swimming 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:04.290
 one is the pool boy is a 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.940
 a material that will help us 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.560
 work the technique mostly of arms 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:09.420
 is going to make us float a little more 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.950
 and we are a little easier that way 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.720
 look at the exercises and then we have the 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.400
 table that will help us improve the 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.750
 shake of feet and we will review the 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.750
 ramón back errors will help 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:28.980
 good we see in the swimmer as 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:32.070
 clearly the foot shake takes her 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:34.650
 all under water when it should 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:36.660
 be the sole of the foot breaking the 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.730
 surface of it to solve 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:40.050
 this problem let's do an exercise 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:42.900
 is an exercise in contrasts in which 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:45.120
 the swimmer is going to do a stretch of about 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.680
 erroneous by excess, that is to say 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.110
 Excessively taking your feet out 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.330
 It's worth and it's going to do another stretch of meters 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:53.430
 wearing excessively sunken feet 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:55.140
 as we see now the swimmer is going to 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.670
 perform the beat in the correct range 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:59.340
 the sole of the foot to break the 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:01.080
 surface without removing it excessively and 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:03.470
 it's not going to sink beyond 60 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.470
 centimeters 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:10.190
 the next mistake is called swimming 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:11.660
 flat as we see the swimmer is not 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:13.460
 doing any kind of role gone is to say 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:15.530
 is presenting a surface that 

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:17.230
 offers a lot of resistance to progress with 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:19.900
 his two shoulders 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:21.670
 let's say against your progress to 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:23.470
 solve this problem 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:25.510
 the swimmer what he is going to do now is 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:27.849
 every time he does not breathe he does not get the 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:29.980
 head to breathe will bring the 

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:33.489
 thumb brushing the side to the armpit 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:35.379
 that position will force him to perform 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:37.540
 the role we are looking for and not present 

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:39.849
 a surface so resistant to advance 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:42.069
 now let's see the work in a swim 

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:44.830
 natural but yes that participates in 

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:47.500
 role and we do it as 

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:48.819
 offers very little surface of the 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:50.890
 shoulders 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:53.170
 in every breath that does the 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:56.370
 next mistake we see a recovery 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:56.370
 excessively lateral 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:03.020
 we have like the hand 

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:03.020
 and the elbow do not go as high as possible 

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:08.349
 making a consumption 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:10.900
 excessive energy in the next 

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:13.599
 exercise we can see how the recovery and 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:15.670
 He has his elbow very high and we see how the 

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:17.229
 back of the hand points exactly 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:19.350
 where is it going that gives us a 

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:22.120
 economy in effort and alignment 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:23.770
 correct in the next exercise we see 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:26.440
 as the fingers touch the surface of the 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:27.490
 water enhancing this situation in the 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:30.570
 that the doctor's hand was towards 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:30.570
 front and elbow this very high 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:34.780
 now on the natural side we see how 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:36.340
 the fingers do not touch the surface of the 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:38.290
 water but the back is still going 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:39.760
 pointing forward and from the elbow towards 

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:42.470
 down it goes completely relaxed there's no 

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:44.330
 no kind of intentionality for him 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:46.460
 so it is a very economical gesture 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:49.160
 another mistake that we're going to see is the 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:51.350
 horizontal misalignment we see that between 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:53.930
 the hand completely crossed almost by 

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:56.810
 in front of the head this causes a 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:58.580
 horizontal misalignment we think it's going 

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:00.980
 to be posing in the water causing 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:03.320
 a hindrance or a resistance to the advance 

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:04.880
 very important the next exercise is 

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:06.530
 also contrast is where we are going to 

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:08.080
 make mistakes by excess and by default 

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:11.060
 we have as the swimmer is crossing 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:12.860
 intentionally the arms to 

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:15.260
 try to focus attention on what 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:17.150
 produces is that movement that 

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:20.280
 Sensibility offers the winner 

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:22.320
 this section we see as the swimmer 

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:24.660
 his hand comes in contact with the water 

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:27.290
 very open practically touching the 

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:27.290
 cutting the wall 

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:33.320
 we still want to stay the range 

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:36.210
 in the middle we see now as the swimmer 

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:37.860
 you have to put your hand and put it in a 

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:40.230
 line that we are going to draw from the 

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:43.150
 outer part of the shoulder and nose of 

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:45.460
 that fringe is to say in relation 

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:47.740
 in line with the shoulder you have to enter 

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:50.550
 the hand in the water if we do it like this goes 

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:52.600
 to maintain linearity in its advance 

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:54.040
 well I hope these tips and these 

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:55.570
 exercises have helped you to remove 

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:57.460
 the fears in the world of 

00:05:55.570 --> 00:06:00.820
 swimming and encourage you to participate in 

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:02.590
 the triathlon is with guarantees by
