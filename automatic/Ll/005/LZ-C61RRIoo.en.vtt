00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 perfect without any mishap in the 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:07.319
 automobile I meet the teacher in 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.460
 mechanic chose red how is what 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.250
 good glad you are with us 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.080
 in here we are and really like ladies 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.120
 sometimes they even say that we have 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.800
 the fault that they collide and that I do not know that 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.320
 you're going to things that's why we want 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.080
 learn you and I today what is 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.939
 what we have to see that everything is very 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.220
 very good to be able to say my car can 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.859
 go out on the road ok 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.689
 the important thing is to review levels give us 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.560
 mind that the levels of the car are in 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.560
 perfect conditions 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:39.680
 for example the engine oil is very 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:41.239
 necessary for the manufacture of the motor 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.620
 although when we talk about levels it's 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:44.780
 everything the liquid more is what they are 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:47.030
 liquids that practically then in 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:49.250
 the case of motor oil is very 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:53.030
 indispensable for the lubrication of 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:55.070
 east engine or already modern cars 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:57.980
 many modern cars tell us the 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:01.220
 level already electronically but the best 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:02.899
 way is to check it with your bayonet and this 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:04.580
 You can make the following mention 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:06.830
 is that it's the bayonet because there are gentlemen 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:08.450
 truth that pity other stars that 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:10.520
 seems to feel the oil bayonet 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:12.040
 where we have to do is 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:14.200
 clean 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:16.740
 insert the oil bayonet 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.740
 again 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:23.780
 and extract it and then we can see well 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.369
 the level of oil that this gives us to 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.740
 relationships that we know nothing about you 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:30.049
 forgive 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:32.049
 has already has to measure truth has 

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:34.789
 a measure that although it has been 

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:37.700
 civilian we have already reached to see the maximum 

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:39.679
 maximum and in the bottom part comes what 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.179
 that is the minimum although jci if we 

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:43.250
 we find that the level is 

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:45.140
 between the minimum and the maximum ok then 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:48.770
 There is not much problem but there will be 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:51.319
 fill to fill this this liquid 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.670
 to these the link what we would have to 

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:54.920
 do is remove the filler cap 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:55.549
 even he has to a lamp of 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.310
 ok oil 

00:01:55.549 --> 00:02:00.439
 that is the angel that is this putting 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:02.179
 oil little by little go putting the 

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:04.340
 bayonet taking it out too to go 

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:06.560
 seeing that the level is being 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.000
 where the correct is to the maximum the maximum 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.979
 it must be said it is important not 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.480
 surpass it because if we 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:13.250
 we went from the maximum then it's 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:15.769
 harmful to the launch we can 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:17.480
 we damage the anti pollution system 

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:19.129
 of the body although that would be a point 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.989
 excellent sir then we already know the 

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:22.850
 oil before leaving that is well 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:24.050
 perfectly then that would be another step 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:27.490
 important to leave 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:27.490
 It was another important step 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:32.790
 we could consider what is the 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:35.550
 windshield washer fluid we even go 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:39.570
 to fill here we have these 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:41.490
 they are very well fills both today and 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:44.010
 it is always there or there is another place where 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:46.410
 can be the heel there is another there 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:48.420
 different positions have different 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:51.360
 positions the important thing is that we 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:54.930
 let's realize that the liquid 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:56.970
 windshield wiper dry precisely the 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.370
 symbol of my crystalline and it is important 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:01.200
 Do not put water in the tap because the water 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:05.040
 of the key harms us what has been 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:06.690
 the system cleans for it there 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.450
 who puts water with vinegar nothing of 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:10.890
 that better not take care of the special liquid 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:12.150
 to clean so they do not listen to me 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:14.700
 because they're going to be the one who broke down the 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:16.620
 auto to see this would be another then then 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.750
 we left that it is the oil but it has not 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:22.880
 been this one and he has paid for 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.880
 windshield wipers and then we continue 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.610
 we continue with what has been the 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:29.850
 coolant although that for what 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:32.380
 it serves us that's what stabilizes the 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:35.350
 engine temperature although it is very 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:37.930
 important to comment that that should not be 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:40.420
 open with hot engine because this 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:42.520
 liquid works under pressure not if we 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:44.620
 We open with the hot vehicle on 

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:46.180
 stopper will go through the air and the 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:49.510
 burn of the person who is 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:51.790
 manipulating is lady put gas and 100% 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:54.670
 sure if then this one where to have it 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:57.310
 we cold fill when they do 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:59.290
 lack and also not to exceed the level 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:01.060
 maximum and that practice what marks us 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:03.040
 a little bit that we greet green 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:05.680
 including many times if this day is 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:07.989
 presents when the vehicle is 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:11.140
 is heating up shows us in the 

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:13.690
 board an indicator light is that there 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:15.850
 lemon high temperature is commonly 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:17.320
 because we no longer have and if we do not 

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:19.750
 case what happens 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:21.390
 if we do not if you can reach 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:23.530
 unveil 5 

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:25.570
 but you have to disarm the entire engine 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:27.960
 then since we're going three things that 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:27.960
 we have to
