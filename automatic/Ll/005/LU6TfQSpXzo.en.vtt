00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
the weapon may not necessarily best

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.560 
the weapon may not necessarily best
suited<00:01:13.560> for<00:01:13.590> it<00:01:13.890> it's<00:01:14.100> like<00:01:14.760> an<00:01:15.119> acog<00:01:15.540> scope

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
suited for it it's like an acog scope

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.140 
suited for it it's like an acog scope
and<00:01:16.140> it<00:01:16.320> doesn't<00:01:16.619> have<00:01:16.740> a<00:01:16.770> far<00:01:17.070> zoom<00:01:17.400> but<00:01:17.759> it's

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
and it doesn't have a far zoom but it's

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.060 
and it doesn't have a far zoom but it's
definitely<00:01:18.390> not<00:01:18.930> perfect<00:01:19.259> to<00:01:19.590> use<00:01:19.830> because

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
definitely not perfect to use because

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.010 
definitely not perfect to use because
this<00:01:20.310> weapon<00:01:20.670> cannot<00:01:20.970> fire<00:01:21.240> very<00:01:21.540> far<00:01:21.810> with

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
this weapon cannot fire very far with

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.340 
this weapon cannot fire very far with
its<00:01:22.200> low<00:01:22.470> stability<00:01:23.070> and<00:01:23.310> impact<00:01:23.759> so<00:01:24.720> you'll

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
its low stability and impact so you'll

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.740 
its low stability and impact so you'll
have<00:01:25.560> a<00:01:25.590> tricky<00:01:26.009> time<00:01:26.189> playing<00:01:26.520> with<00:01:26.700> it<00:01:26.880> but

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
have a tricky time playing with it but

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.719 
have a tricky time playing with it but
I'll<00:01:27.990> move<00:01:28.320> on<00:01:28.470> to<00:01:28.650> the<00:01:28.740> skill<00:01:29.009> tree<00:01:29.220> now<00:01:29.369> the

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
I'll move on to the skill tree now the

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.789 
I'll move on to the skill tree now the
super<00:01:30.030> good<00:01:30.180> advice<00:01:30.450> does<00:01:30.780> solar<00:01:31.020> damage<00:01:31.560> and

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
super good advice does solar damage and

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.649 
super good advice does solar damage and
it's<00:01:32.189> a<00:01:32.310> heavy<00:01:32.490> weapon<00:01:32.700> obviously<00:01:33.420> so<00:01:33.570> it

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
it's a heavy weapon obviously so it

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.230 
it's a heavy weapon obviously so it
takes<00:01:33.810> up<00:01:33.990> that<00:01:34.110> slot<00:01:34.470> in<00:01:34.710> its<00:01:35.490> pretty<00:01:35.820> middle

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
takes up that slot in its pretty middle

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.450 
of the road for machine guns as far as
stability<00:01:39.119> vs<00:01:39.509> impact<00:01:39.960> is<00:01:40.229> it's<00:01:40.500> not<00:01:41.009> like<00:01:41.220> the

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
stability vs impact is it's not like the

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.249 
stability vs impact is it's not like the

high impact and low rate of fire this

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.560 
high impact and low rate of fire this
weapons<00:01:45.509> gonna<00:01:46.020> be<00:01:46.200> much<00:01:46.860> faster<00:01:47.159> firing<00:01:47.579> than

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
weapons gonna be much faster firing than

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.429

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
ammo capacity used to be much smaller

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:57.350 
ammo capacity used to be much smaller
but<00:01:54.899> Bungie<00:01:55.439> buffed<00:01:56.040> it<00:01:56.189> up<00:01:56.369> to<00:01:56.520> 58<00:01:56.880> which<00:01:57.210> is

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
but Bungie buffed it up to 58 which is

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.179 
but Bungie buffed it up to 58 which is
very<00:01:57.570> solid<00:01:58.020> and<00:01:58.140> you<00:01:58.469> won't<00:01:58.649> find<00:01:58.860> yourself

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
very solid and you won't find yourself

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:00.830 
very solid and you won't find yourself
running<00:01:59.369> into<00:01:59.759> issues<00:01:59.880> with<00:02:00.210> ammo<00:02:00.540> with<00:02:00.689> this

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
running into issues with ammo with this

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.080 
running into issues with ammo with this
weapon<00:02:01.070> the<00:02:02.070> first<00:02:02.280> three<00:02:02.549> upgrades<00:02:02.880> are<00:02:03.000> the

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
weapon the first three upgrades are the

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.819 
weapon the first three upgrades are the
recoil<00:02:03.509> and<00:02:03.810> I'll<00:02:03.930> compare<00:02:04.290> those<00:02:04.409> later<00:02:04.680> in

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
recoil and I'll compare those later in

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:07.160 
recoil and I'll compare those later in
the<00:02:04.950> video<00:02:05.040> then<00:02:05.909> you<00:02:06.060> unlock<00:02:06.390> crowd<00:02:06.719> control

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
the video then you unlock crowd control

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.109 
the video then you unlock crowd control
which<00:02:07.439> is<00:02:07.649> allowing<00:02:08.399> you<00:02:08.489> to<00:02:08.610> get<00:02:08.759> bonus

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
which is allowing you to get bonus

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.760 
which is allowing you to get bonus
damage<00:02:09.300> after<00:02:09.629> you<00:02:09.929> kill<00:02:10.140> an<00:02:10.229> enemy<00:02:10.349> this

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
damage after you kill an enemy this

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.440 
damage after you kill an enemy this
works<00:02:11.009> well<00:02:11.220> with<00:02:11.340> super<00:02:11.730> good<00:02:11.879> advice

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
works well with super good advice

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.520 
works well with super good advice
especially<00:02:12.780> with<00:02:12.870> its<00:02:13.050> high<00:02:13.170> rate<00:02:13.410> of<00:02:13.440> fire

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
especially with its high rate of fire

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.400 
especially with its high rate of fire
next<00:02:14.459> one<00:02:14.580> you<00:02:14.700> have<00:02:14.879> are<00:02:15.239> the<00:02:15.599> three<00:02:15.870> three

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
next one you have are the three three

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.110 
next one you have are the three three
you<00:02:16.530> can<00:02:16.650> choose<00:02:16.860> from<00:02:16.980> and<00:02:17.220> then<00:02:17.550> that<00:02:17.730> single

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
you can choose from and then that single

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.330 
you can choose from and then that single
point<00:02:18.300> sling<00:02:18.629> which<00:02:18.870> allows<00:02:19.110> you<00:02:19.290> to<00:02:19.440> move

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
point sling which allows you to move

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.729 
point sling which allows you to move
faster<00:02:20.879> and<00:02:21.000> switch<00:02:21.209> weapons<00:02:21.420> faster<00:02:22.140> and

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:22.739 
faster and switch weapons faster and

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:25.100 
faster and switch weapons faster and

weapon<00:02:25.349> an<00:02:25.440> extended<00:02:25.950> range<00:02:26.160> so<00:02:26.489> just<00:02:26.700> further

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
weapon an extended range so just further

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:28.820 
weapon an extended range so just further
range<00:02:27.300> and<00:02:27.569> then<00:02:27.900> flared<00:02:28.200> magwell<00:02:28.290> which

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
range and then flared magwell which

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:30.559 
range and then flared magwell which
allows<00:02:29.069> you<00:02:29.250> to<00:02:29.430> reload<00:02:29.730> the<00:02:29.760> weapon<00:02:30.000> faster

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:30.569 
allows you to reload the weapon faster

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:32.990 
allows you to reload the weapon faster
all<00:02:30.750> of<00:02:31.319> these<00:02:31.470> are<00:02:31.680> great<00:02:32.010> but<00:02:32.489> they're<00:02:32.819> not

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
all of these are great but they're not

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.660 
all of these are great but they're not
really<00:02:33.290> incredible<00:02:34.290> so<00:02:34.920> you<00:02:35.040> can<00:02:35.250> choose<00:02:35.459> any

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
really incredible so you can choose any

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.070 
really incredible so you can choose any
one<00:02:35.790> of<00:02:35.940> them<00:02:36.180> and<00:02:36.480> you<00:02:36.599> won't<00:02:36.750> have<00:02:36.840> an<00:02:37.019> issue

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
one of them and you won't have an issue

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.170 
one of them and you won't have an issue
with<00:02:37.260> them<00:02:37.530> I<00:02:37.680> use<00:02:37.950> the<00:02:38.099> extended<00:02:38.610> range<00:02:38.819> from

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
with them I use the extended range from

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.570 
with them I use the extended range from
hand-loaded<00:02:39.630> but<00:02:40.110> that's<00:02:40.860> pretty<00:02:41.220> useless

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
hand-loaded but that's pretty useless

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:43.190 
hand-loaded but that's pretty useless
because<00:02:41.760> this<00:02:42.000> guns<00:02:42.209> not<00:02:42.480> great<00:02:42.750> at<00:02:42.930> a<00:02:42.959> fire

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
because this guns not great at a fire

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.930 
because this guns not great at a fire
range<00:02:43.500> anyways<00:02:43.950> because<00:02:44.220> it's<00:02:44.760> very

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
range anyways because it's very

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:46.910 
range anyways because it's very
inaccurate<00:02:45.330> the<00:02:45.959> last<00:02:46.200> upgrade<00:02:46.380> is<00:02:46.680> pretty

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
inaccurate the last upgrade is pretty

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.320 
inaccurate the last upgrade is pretty
cool<00:02:47.130> it's<00:02:47.310> called<00:02:47.489> the<00:02:47.549> super<00:02:47.700> good<00:02:48.000> advice

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
cool it's called the super good advice

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.330 
cool it's called the super good advice
and<00:02:48.660> almost<00:02:49.080> all<00:02:49.349> the<00:02:49.530> shots<00:02:49.769> that<00:02:49.920> you<00:02:50.099> fire

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
weapon don't really complement this

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.759 
weapon don't really complement this
though<00:03:05.519> the<00:03:06.299> crowd<00:03:06.540> control<00:03:06.930> does<00:03:07.260> to<00:03:07.650> an

is<00:03:10.079> more<00:03:10.260> like<00:03:10.290> a<00:03:10.470> handicap<00:03:11.130> perk<00:03:11.430> because

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
is more like a handicap perk because

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.449 
is more like a handicap perk because
there's<00:03:12.690> guns<00:03:12.870> very<00:03:13.140> inaccurate<00:03:13.410> and<00:03:13.860> its

there's guns very inaccurate and its

that<00:03:16.500> you<00:03:16.620> missed<00:03:16.859> it's<00:03:17.489> not<00:03:17.639> going<00:03:17.850> to

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
that you missed it's not going to

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:20.420 
that you missed it's not going to
benefit<00:03:18.329> you<00:03:18.690> though<00:03:18.900> in<00:03:19.170> the<00:03:19.350> long<00:03:19.560> term<00:03:19.799> so<00:03:20.160> I

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
benefit you though in the long term so I

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.699 
benefit you though in the long term so I
don't<00:03:20.730> really<00:03:20.790> love<00:03:21.480> it<00:03:21.660> it's<00:03:21.870> just<00:03:22.079> very<00:03:22.319> cool

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
don't really love it it's just very cool

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:25.729 
don't really love it it's just very cool
that<00:03:22.739> you<00:03:23.069> get<00:03:23.639> so<00:03:23.790> much<00:03:23.880> amo<00:03:24.209> back<00:03:24.440> the<00:03:25.440> three

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:25.739 
that you get so much amo back the three

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:28.520 
that you get so much amo back the three
upgrades<00:03:26.160> for<00:03:26.549> the<00:03:26.750> recoil<00:03:27.750> are<00:03:28.049> smooth

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
upgrades for the recoil are smooth

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:30.289 
upgrades for the recoil are smooth
ballistics<00:03:29.100> which<00:03:29.310> is<00:03:29.459> most<00:03:29.670> balanced<00:03:30.150> on<00:03:30.269> the

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:30.299 
ballistics which is most balanced on the

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:32.509 
ballistics which is most balanced on the
right<00:03:30.600> soft<00:03:31.380> ballistics<00:03:32.010> in<00:03:32.190> the<00:03:32.280> middle

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:32.519 
right soft ballistics in the middle

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:34.640 
right soft ballistics in the middle
which<00:03:32.670> gives<00:03:32.910> you<00:03:33.030> the<00:03:33.150> most<00:03:33.269> range<00:03:33.750> and<00:03:34.109> then

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
which gives you the most range and then

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:37.039 
which gives you the most range and then
cqb<00:03:35.400> ballistics<00:03:35.940> which<00:03:36.150> gives<00:03:36.690> you<00:03:36.810> the<00:03:36.930> most

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:37.049

stability<00:03:37.650> in<00:03:37.889> this<00:03:38.549> video<00:03:38.850> I'm<00:03:39.090> trying<00:03:39.389> to

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
stability in this video I'm trying to

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:42.470 
stability in this video I'm trying to
control<00:03:40.079> the<00:03:40.380> recoil<00:03:40.709> but<00:03:41.489> the<00:03:41.819> difference

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
control the recoil but the difference

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.559 
control the recoil but the difference
between<00:03:43.319> them<00:03:43.500> is<00:03:43.530> very<00:03:43.799> marginal<00:03:44.370> and<00:03:44.609> I<00:03:45.389> go

00:03:45.559 --> 00:03:45.569 
between them is very marginal and I go

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:47.780 
between them is very marginal and I go
with<00:03:45.690> cqb<00:03:46.350> ballistics<00:03:46.920> because<00:03:47.310> it's<00:03:47.579> just

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
with cqb ballistics because it's just

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:50.210 
with cqb ballistics because it's just
easier<00:03:48.090> to<00:03:48.239> control<00:03:48.620> so<00:03:49.620> now<00:03:49.769> I'll<00:03:49.859> rant<00:03:50.100> about

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
easier to control so now I'll rant about

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.580 
easier to control so now I'll rant about
my<00:03:50.430> opinion<00:03:50.850> on<00:03:50.970> the<00:03:51.090> gun<00:03:51.269> and<00:03:51.600> I<00:03:51.959> really<00:03:52.319> want

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
my opinion on the gun and I really want

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:54.800 
my opinion on the gun and I really want
to<00:03:52.799> love<00:03:53.100> this<00:03:53.280> weapon<00:03:53.700> holding<00:03:54.420> it<00:03:54.540> feels

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810 
to love this weapon holding it feels

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:57.680 
to love this weapon holding it feels
nice<00:03:55.049> the<00:03:55.319> sound<00:03:55.650> is<00:03:55.889> so<00:03:55.920> like<00:03:56.849> sharp<00:03:57.450> and

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:57.690 
nice the sound is so like sharp and

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:00.170 
nice the sound is so like sharp and
responsive<00:03:58.290> in<00:03:58.500> the<00:03:59.340> fact<00:03:59.549> that<00:03:59.639> you<00:03:59.790> get<00:03:59.940> so

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
responsive in the fact that you get so

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.750 
responsive in the fact that you get so
much<00:04:00.329> ammo<00:04:00.720> back<00:04:00.930> it's<00:04:01.170> just<00:04:01.349> really<00:04:01.590> cool<00:04:01.920> but

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 
much ammo back it's just really cool but

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:04.699 
much ammo back it's just really cool but
the<00:04:03.030> whole<00:04:03.299> point<00:04:03.329> of<00:04:03.690> firing<00:04:04.049> a<00:04:04.109> weapon<00:04:04.260> is<00:04:04.530> to

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:04.709 
the whole point of firing a weapon is to

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:06.770 
the whole point of firing a weapon is to
hit<00:04:04.859> targets<00:04:05.280> and<00:04:05.579> I<00:04:05.880> don't<00:04:06.480> want<00:04:06.630> to<00:04:06.690> be

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780 
hit targets and I don't want to be

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:08.390 
hit targets and I don't want to be
missing<00:04:07.200> just<00:04:07.230> getting<00:04:07.739> my<00:04:07.829> ammo<00:04:08.069> back<00:04:08.250> I

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
missing just getting my ammo back I

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.099 
missing just getting my ammo back I
wanna<00:04:08.609> get<00:04:08.760> bonus<00:04:09.090> for<00:04:09.269> hitting<00:04:09.540> people<00:04:09.870> like

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:10.109 
wanna get bonus for hitting people like

00:04:10.109 --> 00:04:12.500 
wanna get bonus for hitting people like
getting<00:04:10.410> an<00:04:10.530> angle<00:04:10.709> back<00:04:10.859> it's<00:04:11.579> just<00:04:11.819> it's<00:04:12.329> not

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510 
getting an angle back it's just it's not

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:14.690 
getting an angle back it's just it's not
great<00:04:12.900> and<00:04:13.139> I'm<00:04:13.380> only<00:04:13.560> seeing<00:04:13.950> this<00:04:14.160> benefit

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 
great and I'm only seeing this benefit

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:16.879 
great and I'm only seeing this benefit
from<00:04:14.910> this<00:04:15.060> perk<00:04:15.419> every<00:04:15.870> like<00:04:16.079> few<00:04:16.440> shots<00:04:16.680> I'm

00:04:16.879 --> 00:04:16.889 
from this perk every like few shots I'm

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:18.920 
from this perk every like few shots I'm
its<00:04:17.130> and<00:04:17.729> even<00:04:18.060> then<00:04:18.239> it's<00:04:18.510> not<00:04:18.570> a<00:04:18.690> hundred

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:18.930 
its and even then it's not a hundred

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:20.420 
its and even then it's not a hundred
percent<00:04:19.079> chance<00:04:19.470> I'm<00:04:19.709> gonna<00:04:19.829> get<00:04:20.039> them<00:04:20.220> back

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430 
percent chance I'm gonna get them back

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:22.670 
percent chance I'm gonna get them back
so<00:04:20.729> there's<00:04:21.690> no<00:04:21.840> real<00:04:22.019> point<00:04:22.229> to<00:04:22.440> it<00:04:22.560> I

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:22.680 
so there's no real point to it I

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:23.990 
so there's no real point to it I
understand<00:04:23.190> you<00:04:23.310> can't<00:04:23.490> have<00:04:23.669> a

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.000 
understand you can't have a

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.570 
understand you can't have a
like<00:04:24.780> a<00:04:24.990> mo<00:04:25.200> coming<00:04:25.740> back<00:04:25.920> because<00:04:26.130> you<00:04:26.430> could

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:26.580 
like a mo coming back because you could

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:29.360 
like a mo coming back because you could
just<00:04:26.730> fire<00:04:26.910> the<00:04:27.180> gun<00:04:27.720> forever<00:04:28.110> and<00:04:28.380> probably

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:29.370 
just fire the gun forever and probably

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:32.030 
just fire the gun forever and probably
find<00:04:29.610> and<00:04:29.730> exploit<00:04:30.090> that<00:04:30.210> way<00:04:30.620> online<00:04:31.620> i<00:04:31.650> tried

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:32.040 
find and exploit that way online i tried

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:34.790 
find and exploit that way online i tried
using<00:04:32.250> this<00:04:32.490> gun<00:04:32.730> for<00:04:33.000> like<00:04:33.210> 10<00:04:34.080> maybe<00:04:34.410> 20

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800 
using this gun for like 10 maybe 20

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:38.150 
using this gun for like 10 maybe 20
games<00:04:35.190> and<00:04:35.490> i<00:04:35.850> could<00:04:36.060> not<00:04:36.090> get<00:04:36.810> any<00:04:37.080> kills<00:04:37.440> it

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:38.160 
games and i could not get any kills it

games and i could not get any kills it
was<00:04:38.310> very<00:04:38.370> difficult<00:04:39.230> online<00:04:40.230> I<00:04:40.500> was<00:04:40.740> getting

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:41.010 
was very difficult online I was getting

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:43.250 
was very difficult online I was getting
killed<00:04:41.190> by<00:04:41.310> shotguns<00:04:41.940> and<00:04:42.330> just<00:04:42.960> getting

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:09.810 
you I know that I'd take a lot of

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:12.230 
you I know that I'd take a lot of
production<00:06:10.410> but<00:06:11.160> from<00:06:11.610> a<00:06:11.669> company<00:06:11.970> that's

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:12.240 
production but from a company that's

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:13.880 
production but from a company that's
gaining<00:06:12.450> so<00:06:12.600> much<00:06:12.660> money<00:06:12.990> from<00:06:13.229> this<00:06:13.380> game<00:06:13.590> and

so many people are still playing it I
think<00:06:16.050> it<00:06:16.169> might<00:06:16.260> benefit<00:06:16.710> from<00:06:16.770> that<00:06:17.070> it<00:06:17.250> just

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:17.460 
think it might benefit from that it just

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:20.390 
think it might benefit from that it just
it's<00:06:18.090> too<00:06:18.180> bad<00:06:18.450> that<00:06:18.510> it's<00:06:18.870> nothing<00:06:19.229> more<00:06:19.440> but

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:20.400 
it's too bad that it's nothing more but

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:22.219
