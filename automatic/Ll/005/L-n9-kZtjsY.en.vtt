a more broad idea an idea what it is not
a<00:00:50.910> specific<00:00:51.570> item<00:00:52.129> but<00:00:53.129> abroad<00:00:54.110> all<00:00:55.110> you'll

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
a specific item but abroad all you'll

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.090 
a specific item but abroad all you'll
see<00:00:55.680> it's<00:00:56.070> gonna<00:00:56.600> make<00:00:57.600> it<00:00:57.840> so<00:00:58.109> some<00:00:58.500> specific

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
see it's gonna make it so some specific

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.500 
see it's gonna make it so some specific
items<00:00:59.430> are<00:00:59.609> gonna<00:00:59.760> be<00:00:59.910> narrowed<00:01:00.149> down<00:01:00.180> is<00:01:00.480> just

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
items are gonna be narrowed down is just

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.950 
items are gonna be narrowed down is just
that's<00:01:01.230> not<00:01:01.530> gonna<00:01:01.710> be<00:01:01.949> it<00:01:02.160> and<00:01:02.539> it<00:01:03.539> can

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
that's not gonna be it and it can

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.710 
that's not gonna be it and it can
involve<00:01:04.680> a<00:01:04.890> lot<00:01:04.920> more<00:01:05.390> possibilities<00:01:06.390> of<00:01:06.420> what

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
involve a lot more possibilities of what

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.429 
involve a lot more possibilities of what
it<00:01:06.840> can<00:01:07.020> be<00:01:07.200> and<00:01:07.850> this<00:01:08.850> theory<00:01:09.450> I<00:01:09.630> have<00:01:10.170> crab

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
it can be and this theory I have crab

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.250 
it can be and this theory I have crab
mark<00:01:10.890> by<00:01:11.100> myself<00:01:11.549> if<00:01:11.820> you<00:01:12.090> thought<00:01:12.450> this<00:01:12.630> too<00:01:12.900> I

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
mark by myself if you thought this too I

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.410 
mark by myself if you thought this too I
guess<00:01:13.680> it's<00:01:13.830> a<00:01:13.860> coincidence

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
guess it's a coincidence

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.600 
guess it's a coincidence
I<00:01:16.159> have<00:01:17.159> thought<00:01:17.430> deeply<00:01:17.729> about<00:01:17.939> this<00:01:18.360> and<00:01:18.659> I

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:19.610 
I have thought deeply about this and I

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:22.039 
I have thought deeply about this and I
think<00:01:20.610> the<00:01:20.790> evidence<00:01:20.909> is<00:01:21.240> pretty<00:01:21.479> strong<00:01:21.780> in

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
think the evidence is pretty strong in

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.469 
think the evidence is pretty strong in
my<00:01:22.229> opinion<00:01:22.470> in<00:01:22.830> my<00:01:22.860> opinion<00:01:22.979> it's<00:01:23.549> the<00:01:24.330> most

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
my opinion in my opinion it's the most

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.440 
my opinion in my opinion it's the most
sound<00:01:24.750> theory<00:01:25.020> I've<00:01:25.200> heard<00:01:26.030> any<00:01:27.030> case<00:01:27.270> let's

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
sound theory I've heard any case let's

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.380 
sound theory I've heard any case let's
go<00:01:27.600> into<00:01:27.810> the<00:01:27.869> theory<00:01:28.970> I'll<00:01:29.970> try<00:01:30.119> make<00:01:30.299> this

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
go into the theory I'll try make this

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:31.880 
go into the theory I'll try make this
video<00:01:30.540> not<00:01:30.780> too<00:01:31.020> long<00:01:31.200> since<00:01:31.470> the<00:01:31.619> theory

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
video not too long since the theory

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.380 
video not too long since the theory
shouldn't<00:01:32.130> be<00:01:32.190> that<00:01:32.280> long<00:01:32.340> to<00:01:32.549> explain<00:01:32.670> now

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
shouldn't be that long to explain now

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.510 
shouldn't be that long to explain now
this<00:01:33.720> theory<00:01:34.140> involves<00:01:34.830> a<00:01:34.950> couple<00:01:35.220> of<00:01:35.310> things

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
this theory involves a couple of things
