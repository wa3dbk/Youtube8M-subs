kit<00:01:57.020> like<00:01:57.140> this<00:01:57.200> so<00:01:58.130> on<00:01:58.280> the<00:01:58.399> outside<00:01:58.820> let's

00:01:59.230 --> 00:01:59.240 
kit like this so on the outside let's

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.039 
kit like this so on the outside let's
start<00:01:59.600> with<00:01:59.749> that<00:01:59.929> I<00:02:00.170> have<00:02:01.630> I'll<00:02:02.630> just<00:02:02.840> show

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:03.049 
start with that I have I'll just show

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:06.550 
start with that I have I'll just show
you<00:02:03.079> those<00:02:03.380> six<00:02:04.280> I'd<00:02:04.640> screws<00:02:05.289> which<00:02:06.289> will

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:06.560 
you those six I'd screws which will

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.520 
you those six I'd screws which will
enable<00:02:07.280> me<00:02:07.579> to<00:02:07.750> spread<00:02:08.750> the<00:02:08.929> line<00:02:09.140> through

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:09.530 
enable me to spread the line through

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:12.160 
enable me to spread the line through
those<00:02:09.770> and<00:02:10.270> spread<00:02:11.270> the<00:02:11.420> tension<00:02:11.900> through<00:02:12.140> a

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
those and spread the tension through a

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:15.610 
those and spread the tension through a
long<00:02:12.770> stick<00:02:13.220> if<00:02:14.120> I<00:02:14.300> want<00:02:14.480> to<00:02:14.540> make<00:02:14.690> a<00:02:14.720> pole<00:02:15.380> of

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
long stick if I want to make a pole of

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.820 
long stick if I want to make a pole of
some<00:02:15.830> description<00:02:16.130> and<00:02:17.440> then<00:02:18.440> as<00:02:18.680> I<00:02:18.770> said

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
some description and then as I said

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:21.130 
some description and then as I said
before<00:02:19.069> it's<00:02:19.400> a<00:02:19.460> clamshell<00:02:19.730> design<00:02:20.150> so<00:02:20.960> we'll

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
before it's a clamshell design so we'll

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:25.060 
before it's a clamshell design so we'll
just<00:02:21.350> flick<00:02:21.620> the

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:25.070 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:32.540 

it's<00:02:26.070> closed<00:02:26.310> quite<00:02:26.610> tight<00:02:28.160> there<00:02:29.160> we<00:02:29.250> go<00:02:31.550> and

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
it's closed quite tight there we go and

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:33.890 
it's closed quite tight there we go and
let's<00:02:32.610> have<00:02:32.850> a<00:02:32.910> little<00:02:33.090> look<00:02:33.330> see<00:02:33.690> what's

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
let's have a little look see what's

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.400 
let's have a little look see what's
inside

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.410 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:40.100 

well<00:02:37.410> that<00:02:37.590> was<00:02:37.710> why<00:02:37.860> the<00:02:38.810> wait<00:02:39.810> a<00:02:39.840> minute

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
well that was why the wait a minute

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.520 
well that was why the wait a minute
right<00:02:40.890> so<00:02:41.250> I<00:02:41.610> need<00:02:42.000> the<00:02:42.510> large<00:02:42.750> compartment

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
right so I need the large compartment

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.050 
right so I need the large compartment
and<00:02:43.650> I'll<00:02:43.800> put<00:02:44.010> all<00:02:44.220> of<00:02:44.340> this<00:02:44.640> out<00:02:44.850> on<00:02:44.970> the

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
and I'll put all of this out on the

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:46.670 
and I'll put all of this out on the
table<00:02:45.420> so<00:02:45.450> you<00:02:45.570> can<00:02:45.660> see<00:02:45.930> it<00:02:46.020> as<00:02:46.110> well<00:02:46.140> and<00:02:46.500> then

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
table so you can see it as well and then

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.380 
table so you can see it as well and then
we'll<00:02:46.770> do<00:02:46.890> some<00:02:47.100> close-up<00:02:47.730> shots<00:02:47.760> bit<00:02:48.210> later

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
we'll do some close-up shots bit later

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.980 
we'll do some close-up shots bit later
and<00:02:49.260> that's<00:02:49.980> all<00:02:50.220> I<00:02:50.460> thought<00:02:50.670> would<00:02:50.850> be<00:02:51.000> very

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:51.990 
and that's all I thought would be very

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:54.260 
and that's all I thought would be very
very<00:02:52.230> important<00:02:52.680> so<00:02:52.920> I<00:02:52.980> put<00:02:53.310> a<00:02:53.460> little<00:02:53.640> spider

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:54.270 
very important so I put a little spider

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:56.600 
very important so I put a little spider
coat<00:02:54.570> bug<00:02:54.810> in<00:02:54.990> there<00:02:55.200> I'm<00:02:55.590> more<00:02:56.280> than<00:02:56.550> likely

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
coat bug in there I'm more than likely

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:58.760 
coat bug in there I'm more than likely
going<00:02:57.120> to<00:02:57.210> have<00:02:57.390> a<00:02:57.420> knife<00:02:57.750> on<00:02:57.990> me<00:02:58.050> a<00:02:58.410> fixed

00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:58.770 
going to have a knife on me a fixed

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:01.790 
going to have a knife on me a fixed
blade<00:02:58.920> or<00:02:59.160> a<00:02:59.190> good<00:02:59.700> folder<00:03:00.440> but<00:03:01.440> I<00:03:01.470> just

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:01.800 
blade or a good folder but I just

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.560 
blade or a good folder but I just
thought<00:03:01.950> you<00:03:02.250> know<00:03:02.310> something<00:03:02.730> for<00:03:03.030> preparing

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:03.570 
thought you know something for preparing

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:06.530 
thought you know something for preparing
the<00:03:03.690> fish<00:03:03.930> getting<00:03:04.970> all<00:03:05.970> those<00:03:06.150> sorts<00:03:06.510> of

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
the fish getting all those sorts of

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:07.880 
the fish getting all those sorts of
things<00:03:06.720> cut<00:03:06.960> in<00:03:07.050> line<00:03:07.200> I<00:03:07.230> can<00:03:07.470> use<00:03:07.500> something

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
things cut in line I can use something

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:09.560 
things cut in line I can use something
like<00:03:08.040> a<00:03:08.160> spider<00:03:08.460> plug<00:03:08.940> it<00:03:09.090> fits<00:03:09.300> in<00:03:09.450> there

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:09.570 
like a spider plug it fits in there

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:12.190 
like a spider plug it fits in there
perfectly<00:03:09.630> and<00:03:10.440> then<00:03:11.160> I've<00:03:11.250> got<00:03:11.490> a<00:03:11.520> little

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
perfectly and then I've got a little

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.320 
perfectly and then I've got a little
commando<00:03:13.200> I<00:03:13.230> saw<00:03:13.850> so<00:03:14.850> I<00:03:15.030> thought<00:03:15.210> it'd<00:03:15.300> be

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:15.330 
commando I saw so I thought it'd be

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:18.380 
commando I saw so I thought it'd be
quite<00:03:15.570> useful<00:03:16.080> for<00:03:16.250> just<00:03:17.250> cutting<00:03:18.120> the<00:03:18.180> poles

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.390 
quite useful for just cutting the poles

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:20.120 
quite useful for just cutting the poles
to<00:03:18.600> length<00:03:18.780> if<00:03:18.990> needs<00:03:19.230> be<00:03:19.350> now<00:03:19.740> I<00:03:19.770> know<00:03:19.950> these

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 
to length if needs be now I know these

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:21.770 
to length if needs be now I know these
things<00:03:20.310> need<00:03:20.580> to<00:03:20.610> be<00:03:20.730> used<00:03:21.030> in<00:03:21.210> a<00:03:21.270> certain<00:03:21.630> way

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
things need to be used in a certain way

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:25.340 
things need to be used in a certain way
otherwise<00:03:22.650> they<00:03:22.950> can<00:03:23.160> become<00:03:23.310> kit<00:03:23.760> and<00:03:24.350> pretty

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:25.350 
otherwise they can become kit and pretty

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:26.870 
otherwise they can become kit and pretty
useless<00:03:25.710> so<00:03:26.100> you've<00:03:26.190> got<00:03:26.310> to<00:03:26.370> be<00:03:26.430> careful<00:03:26.640> with

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
useless so you've got to be careful with

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.520 
useless so you've got to be careful with
them<00:03:27.060> but<00:03:27.330> you<00:03:27.690> know<00:03:27.810> it's<00:03:27.960> another<00:03:28.200> tool<00:03:28.500> that

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
them but you know it's another tool that

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:31.970 
them but you know it's another tool that
fits<00:03:28.920> in<00:03:29.130> there<00:03:29.400> and<00:03:30.560> then<00:03:31.560> I've<00:03:31.800> got<00:03:31.950> some

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
fits in there and then I've got some

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.370 
fits in there and then I've got some
bait<00:03:32.310> options<00:03:32.760> I<00:03:33.030> decided<00:03:33.390> if<00:03:33.930> anybody<00:03:34.230> goes

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380 
bait options I decided if anybody goes

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.770 
bait options I decided if anybody goes
carp<00:03:34.709> fishing<00:03:35.040> you'll<00:03:36.000> probably<00:03:36.239> know<00:03:36.630> the

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
carp fishing you'll probably know the

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:41.210 
carp fishing you'll probably know the
merits<00:03:37.140> of<00:03:37.530> using<00:03:38.340> bug<00:03:38.550> biscuit<00:03:39.030> on<00:03:40.220> on

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
merits of using bug biscuit on on

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:43.280 
merits of using bug biscuit on on
occasion<00:03:41.730> as<00:03:41.850> well<00:03:42.030> Novosel<00:03:42.750> can<00:03:42.900> hunt<00:03:43.110> for

occasion as well Novosel can hunt for

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:45.710 
occasion as well Novosel can hunt for
slugs<00:03:43.830> and<00:03:44.130> worms<00:03:44.190> and<00:03:44.910> you<00:03:45.180> know<00:03:45.390> all<00:03:45.570> those

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
slugs and worms and you know all those

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.300 
slugs and worms and you know all those
sorts<00:03:46.080> of<00:03:46.140> live<00:03:46.350> baits<00:03:46.680> that<00:03:46.920> kind<00:03:47.100> of<00:03:47.160> thing

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
sorts of live baits that kind of thing

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:49.190 
sorts of live baits that kind of thing
which<00:03:47.430> is<00:03:47.580> fine<00:03:47.790> but<00:03:48.420> I<00:03:48.480> just<00:03:48.720> thought<00:03:48.840> I'd<00:03:48.989> put

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.200 
which is fine but I just thought I'd put

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:50.750 
which is fine but I just thought I'd put
some<00:03:49.230> additional<00:03:49.590> bait<00:03:49.950> options<00:03:50.370> in<00:03:50.550> there

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
some additional bait options in there

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.130 
some additional bait options in there
and<00:03:51.090> what<00:03:51.209> I'm<00:03:51.270> also<00:03:51.390> going<00:03:51.540> to<00:03:51.690> do<00:03:51.870> is<00:03:51.930> put

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:52.140 
and what I'm also going to do is put

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:53.900 
and what I'm also going to do is put
some<00:03:52.320> things<00:03:52.470> like<00:03:52.770> fake<00:03:53.010> maggots<00:03:53.489> and<00:03:53.730> fake
