clear<00:01:22.790> and<00:01:22.970> evident<00:01:23.240> by<00:01:23.570> the<00:01:23.630> fact<00:01:23.930> that<00:01:24.050> they

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:24.560 
clear and evident by the fact that they

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.290

00:03:11.419 --> 00:03:12.970 
done the only thing that hurts you is
your<00:03:11.599> opponent<00:03:11.810> does<00:03:12.200> get<00:03:12.379> the<00:03:12.500> draw<00:03:12.680> cards

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:12.980 
your opponent does get the draw cards

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:14.949 
your opponent does get the draw cards
but<00:03:13.129> considering<00:03:13.700> the<00:03:14.090> other<00:03:14.299> three<00:03:14.629> effects

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:14.959 
but considering the other three effects

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:16.929 
but considering the other three effects
that<00:03:15.109> are<00:03:15.230> all<00:03:15.379> good<00:03:15.799> for<00:03:16.010> you<00:03:16.069> and<00:03:16.459> bad<00:03:16.519> for

00:03:16.929 --> 00:03:16.939 
that are all good for you and bad for

00:03:16.939 --> 00:03:18.940 
that are all good for you and bad for
them<00:03:17.090> I'd<00:03:17.450> say<00:03:17.780> that<00:03:17.959> that<00:03:18.590> is<00:03:18.769> definitely

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:18.950 
them I'd say that that is definitely

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:21.670 
them I'd say that that is definitely
mitigated<00:03:19.459> so<00:03:20.419> overall<00:03:20.780> I<00:03:20.959> think<00:03:21.139> that<00:03:21.349> card

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:21.680 
mitigated so overall I think that card

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:23.319 
mitigated so overall I think that card
destruction<00:03:21.950> is<00:03:22.189> definitely<00:03:22.669> a<00:03:22.700> ban<00:03:23.060> worthy

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:23.329 
destruction is definitely a ban worthy

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:25.240 
destruction is definitely a ban worthy
card<00:03:23.689> I'm<00:03:23.989> not<00:03:24.230> saying<00:03:24.500> that<00:03:24.590> the<00:03:24.739> card<00:03:24.950> should

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.250 
card I'm not saying that the card should

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:27.429 
card I'm not saying that the card should
be<00:03:25.310> bad<00:03:25.609> it's<00:03:25.879> just<00:03:26.150> if<00:03:26.269> one<00:03:26.780> day<00:03:27.049> card

00:03:27.429 --> 00:03:27.439 
be bad it's just if one day card

00:03:27.439 --> 00:03:28.990 
be bad it's just if one day card
instruction<00:03:27.889> was<00:03:28.129> banned<00:03:28.400> it<00:03:28.609> wouldn't<00:03:28.909> be

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:29.000 
instruction was banned it wouldn't be

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.520 
instruction was banned it wouldn't be
like<00:03:29.180> a<00:03:29.359> total<00:03:29.750> shock<00:03:29.989> to<00:03:30.169> me<00:03:30.319> or<00:03:30.379> anything

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.530 
like a total shock to me or anything

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.939 
like a total shock to me or anything
like<00:03:30.650> that

00:03:30.939 --> 00:03:30.949 
like that

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:32.830 
like that
in<00:03:31.069> fact<00:03:31.549> if<00:03:31.790> dark<00:03:32.060> ones<00:03:32.299> would<00:03:32.510> have<00:03:32.599> became

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:32.840 
in fact if dark ones would have became

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:35.890 
in fact if dark ones would have became
like<00:03:33.169> 2<00:03:33.560> or<00:03:33.590> 1<00:03:33.949> or<00:03:34.250> 2<00:03:34.669> 0<00:03:35.090> or<00:03:35.299> stuff<00:03:35.540> like<00:03:35.599> that

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:35.900 
like 2 or 1 or 2 0 or stuff like that

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:37.539
