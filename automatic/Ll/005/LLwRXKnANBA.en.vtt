00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
which and I have been using this as my

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.189 
which and I have been using this as my
main<00:00:26.400> email<00:00:26.670> client<00:00:27.599> for<00:00:27.720> the<00:00:27.779> last<00:00:27.900> couple

main email client for the last couple
days<00:00:28.289> which<00:00:28.529> is<00:00:28.680> why<00:00:28.800> it<00:00:28.859> is<00:00:29.039> in<00:00:29.189> my<00:00:29.340> dock<00:00:29.609> and

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.550 
days which is why it is in my dock and
this<00:00:30.150> will<00:00:30.240> probably<00:00:30.599> reflect<00:00:31.019> in<00:00:31.199> my<00:00:31.230> next

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
this will probably reflect in my next

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.860 
this will probably reflect in my next
what's<00:00:31.830> on<00:00:31.949> my<00:00:32.070> iPhone<00:00:32.099> video<00:00:32.730> whenever<00:00:33.570> that

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
what's on my iPhone video whenever that

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.229 
what's on my iPhone video whenever that
does<00:00:34.050> come<00:00:34.260> out<00:00:34.290> but<00:00:34.710> either<00:00:34.980> way<00:00:35.219> I<00:00:35.430> believe

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
does come out but either way I believe

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:37.370 
does come out but either way I believe
really<00:00:36.360> do<00:00:36.570> like<00:00:36.719> the<00:00:36.870> icon<00:00:37.140> of<00:00:37.260> this

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
really do like the icon of this

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:38.660 
really do like the icon of this
application<00:00:37.950> I<00:00:38.010> think<00:00:38.040> it<00:00:38.250> looks<00:00:38.399> pretty<00:00:38.489> well

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
application I think it looks pretty well

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:39.470 
application I think it looks pretty well
let's<00:00:38.790> take<00:00:38.879> a<00:00:38.940> look<00:00:39.120> at<00:00:39.180> the<00:00:39.270> actual

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
let's take a look at the actual

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.080 
let's take a look at the actual
application<00:00:40.079> itself<00:00:40.590> and<00:00:40.890> opening<00:00:41.760> up<00:00:41.879> my

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
application itself and opening up my

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.670 
application itself and opening up my

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
do have the my mail logo when you open

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.569 
do have the my mail logo when you open
it<00:00:45.660> up<00:00:45.809> and<00:00:46.410> you<00:00:46.559> have<00:00:46.590> a<00:00:46.739> really<00:00:47.100> nice<00:00:47.250> clean

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
it up and you have a really nice clean

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.549 
it up and you have a really nice clean
minimal<00:00:48.090> interface<00:00:48.510> now<00:00:48.989> this<00:00:49.140> looks<00:00:49.350> a<00:00:49.469> lot

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
minimal interface now this looks a lot

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.380 
minimal interface now this looks a lot
like<00:00:49.739> the<00:00:49.890> actual<00:00:50.190> Gmail<00:00:50.610> application<00:00:51.210> for

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
like the actual Gmail application for

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.240 
like the actual Gmail application for
iOS<00:00:51.539> now<00:00:52.320> the<00:00:52.379> only<00:00:52.739> reason<00:00:53.070> that<00:00:53.100> I'm

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
iOS now the only reason that I'm

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.860 
iOS now the only reason that I'm
probably<00:00:53.579> using<00:00:54.059> this<00:00:54.149> over<00:00:54.480> the<00:00:54.570> Gmail

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
probably using this over the Gmail

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.689 
probably using this over the Gmail
application<00:00:55.050> is<00:00:55.649> because<00:00:55.920> it<00:00:56.070> does<00:00:56.190> have<00:00:56.340> iOS

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
application is because it does have iOS

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.209 
application is because it does have iOS
7<00:00:57.000> support<00:00:57.420> now<00:00:57.989> it<00:00:58.170> does<00:00:58.350> follow<00:00:58.530> a<00:00:58.949> lot<00:00:59.190> of

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
7 support now it does follow a lot of

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:00.979 
7 support now it does follow a lot of
the<00:00:59.370> design<00:00:59.609> elements<00:01:00.059> that<00:01:00.149> iOS<00:01:00.449> 7<00:01:00.780> brought

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
the design elements that iOS 7 brought
