so<00:00:26.910> here's<00:00:27.300> a<00:00:27.359> closer<00:00:27.689> look<00:00:27.930> at<00:00:28.109> the<00:00:28.230> traction

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
so here's a closer look at the traction

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.410 
so here's a closer look at the traction
and<00:00:28.890> these<00:00:29.279> black<00:00:29.550> areas<00:00:29.820> you<00:00:30.150> have<00:00:30.240> high

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
and these black areas you have high

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.080 
and these black areas you have high
abrasion<00:00:30.660> rubber<00:00:31.050> and<00:00:31.410> this<00:00:31.830> green<00:00:32.130> area<00:00:32.399> do

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
abrasion rubber and this green area do

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.240 
abrasion rubber and this green area do
not<00:00:33.239> call<00:00:33.480> me<00:00:33.600> on<00:00:33.630> this<00:00:33.840> I<00:00:34.020> believe<00:00:34.380> that<00:00:34.680> it<00:00:34.890> is

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
not call me on this I believe that it is

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.700 
not call me on this I believe that it is
micro<00:00:35.880> G<00:00:36.149> so<00:00:36.510> this<00:00:36.840> isn't<00:00:37.230> gonna<00:00:37.320> be<00:00:37.559> as

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
micro G so this isn't gonna be as

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.220 
micro G so this isn't gonna be as
durable<00:00:38.160> as<00:00:38.219> these<00:00:38.520> black<00:00:38.910> areas<00:00:39.270> and<00:00:39.780> if<00:00:40.110> you

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
durable as these black areas and if you

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.709 
durable as these black areas and if you
saw<00:00:40.469> my<00:00:40.710> UA<00:00:40.980> spike<00:00:41.520> let's<00:00:41.820> review<00:00:42.300> you<00:00:42.540> know

this<00:01:47.850> little<00:01:48.090> area<00:01:48.450> right<00:01:48.840> here<00:01:48.869> this<00:01:49.560> is<00:01:49.619> what

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
this little area right here this is what

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.550 
this little area right here this is what
underarmour<00:01:50.490> calls<00:01:50.790> their<00:01:51.149> stability<00:01:51.840> bar

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
underarmour calls their stability bar

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.710 
underarmour calls their stability bar
it's<00:01:52.890> the<00:01:53.070> same<00:01:53.310> material<00:01:53.490> found<00:01:53.970> here<00:01:54.299> on<00:01:54.479> the

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
it's the same material found here on the

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.810 
it's the same material found here on the
heel<00:01:54.960> cup<00:01:55.290> it<00:01:55.470> just<00:01:55.500> adds<00:01:55.920> a<00:01:56.189> little<00:01:56.399> bit<00:01:56.520> more

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
heel cup it just adds a little bit more

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.480 
heel cup it just adds a little bit more
strength<00:01:57.270> and<00:01:57.540> support<00:01:57.810> in<00:01:58.229> this<00:01:58.680> area<00:01:59.159> for<00:01:59.430> a

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
strength and support in this area for a

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.580 
strength and support in this area for a
lot<00:01:59.700> more<00:01:59.939> stability<00:02:00.149> I<00:02:00.659> really<00:02:01.110> really<00:02:01.380> like

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
lot more stability I really really like

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.530 
lot more stability I really really like
this<00:02:01.770> addition<00:02:02.430> it's<00:02:02.700> gonna<00:02:02.909> give<00:02:03.149> runners<00:02:03.509> a

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
this addition it's gonna give runners a

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.300 
this addition it's gonna give runners a
lot<00:02:03.780> more<00:02:03.960> stability<00:02:04.170> so<00:02:04.770> you<00:02:04.920> could<00:02:05.130> run

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
lot more stability so you could run

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:06.000 
lot more stability so you could run
faster

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:06.010 
faster

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:07.890 
faster
comfortably<00:02:06.550> so<00:02:06.880> the<00:02:07.000> upper<00:02:07.360> is<00:02:07.450> a<00:02:07.480> synthetic

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:07.900 
comfortably so the upper is a synthetic

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:10.530 
comfortably so the upper is a synthetic
material<00:02:08.229> it's<00:02:09.070> very<00:02:09.190> very<00:02:10.030> lightweight

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:10.540 
material it's very very lightweight

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:12.750 
material it's very very lightweight
I<00:02:10.690> think<00:02:10.960> this<00:02:11.500> pair<00:02:11.770> weighs<00:02:11.950> about<00:02:12.250> six<00:02:12.520> point

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
I think this pair weighs about six point

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.090 
I think this pair weighs about six point
five<00:02:12.970> ounces<00:02:13.630> somewhere<00:02:14.470> around<00:02:14.530> that<00:02:14.800> range

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:15.100 
five ounces somewhere around that range

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:17.580 
five ounces somewhere around that range
very<00:02:15.610> very<00:02:16.000> lightweight<00:02:16.300> this<00:02:16.780> upper<00:02:17.410> was

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
very very lightweight this upper was

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:20.400 
very very lightweight this upper was
actually<00:02:18.190> constructed<00:02:18.520> in<00:02:19.060> a<00:02:19.270> bra<00:02:19.630> factory

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
actually constructed in a bra factory

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.710 
actually constructed in a bra factory
and<00:02:20.710> under<00:02:21.070> armours<00:02:21.460> all<00:02:21.640> about<00:02:22.030> that<00:02:22.240> perfect

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
and under armours all about that perfect

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.540 
and under armours all about that perfect
fit<00:02:22.900> so<00:02:23.050> they<00:02:23.200> went<00:02:23.380> to<00:02:23.440> a<00:02:23.530> bra<00:02:23.800> Factory<00:02:24.340> what

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:24.550 
fit so they went to a bra Factory what

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:25.980 
fit so they went to a bra Factory what
they<00:02:24.670> did<00:02:24.880> was<00:02:25.090> they<00:02:25.270> installed<00:02:25.750> these

it really feels like the foots rapping
on<00:02:44.230> to<00:02:44.560> your<00:02:44.740> foot<00:02:45.010> rather<00:02:45.220> than<00:02:45.580> just<00:02:45.850> being

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:46.330 
on to your foot rather than just being

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
there and as far as the ventilation you

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.580 
there and as far as the ventilation you
have<00:02:48.760> plenty<00:02:49.060> of<00:02:49.150> perforations<00:02:49.690> where<00:02:50.260> it<00:02:50.470> is

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
have plenty of perforations where it is

have plenty of perforations where it is
needed<00:02:50.860> most<00:02:50.980> up<00:02:51.400> here<00:02:51.820> on<00:02:52.000> the<00:02:52.360> top<00:02:52.600> so<00:02:52.840> he<00:02:53.020> can

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
needed most up here on the top so he can

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:54.870 
needed most up here on the top so he can
escape<00:02:53.530> because<00:02:53.800> heat<00:02:54.010> rises<00:02:54.160> you<00:02:54.730> have<00:02:54.850> a

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:54.880 
escape because heat rises you have a

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:56.460 
escape because heat rises you have a
little<00:02:55.090> bit<00:02:55.270> more<00:02:55.480> over<00:02:55.660> here<00:02:56.080> and<00:02:56.290> a<00:02:56.440> little

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
little bit more over here and a little

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:58.380 
little bit more over here and a little
bit<00:02:56.890> more<00:02:57.100> in<00:02:57.220> the<00:02:57.340> mid<00:02:57.520> foot<00:02:57.730> on<00:02:57.970> the<00:02:58.150> heel

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390 
bit more in the mid foot on the heel

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:00.540 
bit more in the mid foot on the heel
there<00:02:58.810> is<00:02:58.959> no<00:02:59.140> ventilation<00:02:59.800> but<00:03:00.160> due<00:03:00.340> to<00:03:00.370> the

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:00.550 
there is no ventilation but due to the

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:02.550 
there is no ventilation but due to the
low<00:03:00.730> cut<00:03:01.000> that<00:03:01.450> isn't<00:03:01.870> a<00:03:01.930> big<00:03:02.140> deal

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
low cut that isn't a big deal

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.230 
low cut that isn't a big deal
speaking<00:03:03.010> of<00:03:03.100> the<00:03:03.190> heel<00:03:03.400> here<00:03:03.700> you<00:03:03.820> have<00:03:04.030> a

speaking of the heel here you have a

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:07.050 
speaking of the heel here you have a
seamless<00:03:04.600> molded<00:03:05.530> heel<00:03:05.950> cup<00:03:06.250> it's<00:03:06.550> really

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
seamless molded heel cup it's really

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:09.330 
seamless molded heel cup it's really
pliable<00:03:07.600> but<00:03:07.780> it's<00:03:08.140> enough<00:03:08.530> to<00:03:08.560> add<00:03:08.890> more

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
pliable but it's enough to add more

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.760 
pliable but it's enough to add more

connected to the heel cup and then

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:37.380 
connected to the heel cup and then

here's the upper it goes straight into
there<00:03:37.630> they<00:03:37.930> probably<00:03:38.170> fuse<00:03:38.680> the<00:03:38.890> heel<00:03:39.130> cup<00:03:39.370> to
