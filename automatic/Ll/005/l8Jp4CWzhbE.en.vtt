00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.419
 good guys welcome to a new 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.759
 video this video is based on the 

00:00:21.419 --> 00:00:26.010
 turtle alligator ok I wanted to explain 

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:27.660
 a little 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.100
 its characteristics and where it lives 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.380
 but first I want to talk to you a little 

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:32.790
 of one thing that happens to me these days and it's 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.890
 that the bastards of the turtles 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.380
 final they had to eat a fish 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.820
 several left to put in half I 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.790
 I already knew that I would get to this 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:44.950
 at this point it's worth a lot of melo 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:47.200
 you said be careful I already 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:49.600
 I knew and I told you in the comments that 

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:53.079
 I already know that that day will come but 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:56.199
 good they will take they led the prisoners already 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:57.580
 they carried six media with the bills I 

00:00:56.199 --> 00:01:00.730
 I did not think it was going to happen but obviously 

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:03.370
 when they grow they taste and serve 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:06.670
 is that is can the flesh of the ark the 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:08.259
 channel next door obviously the 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:11.110
 take advantage of that's how nature is 

00:01:08.259 --> 00:01:13.570
 now we are animals hunt for 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:16.090
 live but good was not the intention of 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:18.820
 feed them fish 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:22.659
 my intention was to teach them that you can 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:25.060
 have fish but in the end I have 

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:27.490
 wrong with that I do not recommend 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:32.730
 put contractures fish unless 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:34.840
 What do you want to feed him? 

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:37.450
 and 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:39.789
 questions that can arise to you that if I 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:42.670
 I'm going to put it well if I'm going to give you 

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:44.920
 alive fish of those in a future then 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:46.960
 obviously I think so but well 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:49.299
 it's going to be in the far future 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:52.780
 because for now I do not want to give them that 

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:54.700
 now they are eating feed and you know 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:57.700
 that I'm going to make a video now 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.500
 prompt of this about what you have 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.899
 than give them these turtles in this 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:05.709
 moment is like mine for example 

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:08.769
 Well, nothing, that's what happened and 

00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:10.479
 Well, I could not do anything and 

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:12.400
 obviously I found myself in the middle and the 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:16.130
 another one because I do not have it here either 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:18.200
 I have taken it out and nothing 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:21.680
 now let's go guys talk about 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:24.080
 the heyman turtles now good guys 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:26.030
 as I said we were going to solve the 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:29.000
 turtle alligator is worth a name 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:31.700
 scientist is macro system inc and vale is 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:36.060
 one of the turtles is one of the 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:38.910
 largest freshwater turtles in the world 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:42.450
 with many other more turtles but that 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:45.959
 is let's say I think the biggest one 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:48.599
 of the three largest in the world of the most 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:50.580
 great is the best said good this is 

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:52.650
 a turtle that gets chalk for a 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:54.940
 huge head with the long and pretty 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:03:00.190
 gross 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:03:02.680
 weight ranges between 80 and 120 kilos have 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:06.460
 found copies of more than 100 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:08.830
 kilos and a length of more than 80 

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:10.840
 centimeters have been found exemplary 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:12.590
 of more than more than 80 centimeters 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:16.180
 perfectly 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:16.180
 in freedom obviously 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:21.530
 and good and a very important fact is that 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:23.569
 this turtle hunts differently 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:25.909
 it's not like the others that are leaving 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:30.200
 running for the dam as the guys 

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:32.939
 this hunt with an appendix uniform 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:35.620
 What does he have in his language? 

00:03:32.939 --> 00:03:38.189
 which is very similar to a worm that 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:38.189
 used for 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:42.940
 good for 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:44.940
 the fish do not 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:48.130
 so that the fish believe that it is a 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:51.880
 worm come 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:54.430
 and catch the fish with your mouth when 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:58.460
 these are close to swallow or to 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:04:02.150
 eat the worm as she takes advantage 

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:08.270
 to catch them with their forts 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:11.630
 jaws and obviously from this hand and 

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:12.920
 in this way hunting the alligator turtle not 

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:15.800
 it's like the others that go for their 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:19.100
 company is not cheating the fish and I know 

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:22.430
 eat vale and the main habitat are 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:24.590
 the rivers lakes marshes main 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:27.630
 mainly the lakes and marshes of 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:29.720
 the rivers good too 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:32.420
 but mainly in lakes and swamps 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:34.410
 from central america and north america 

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:37.490
 mainly there may also be for 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:39.000
 South America but not so much 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:41.760
 mainly it is for central america 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.970
 which is where they come from then they have 

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:43.970
 gone 

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:51.560
 for North America is worth not very 

00:04:47.819 --> 00:04:53.630
 north but good 

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:57.380
 it is also north america by 

00:04:53.630 --> 00:05:01.070
 the Mississippi River more or less of America 

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:05.060
 central also and if the Mississippi River 

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:06.950
 and its tributaries obviously and well then 

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:11.080
 also a very important fact is that 

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:11.080
 this turtle is worth 

00:05:11.249 --> 00:05:18.809
 is one of those who are in the top 10 or 

00:05:16.559 --> 00:05:23.039
 I was I do not know if now I still imagine 

00:05:18.809 --> 00:05:26.369
 yes, I had my jaw 

00:05:23.039 --> 00:05:29.309
 the world's strongest jawline I think 

00:05:26.369 --> 00:05:32.669
 which was in the top 5 or the top 6 is worth 

00:05:29.309 --> 00:05:35.789
 I do not remember very well but two years ago 

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:38.639
 years the 10 are in a documentary that 

00:05:35.789 --> 00:05:40.049
 agreement since I still remember that and 

00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:41.669
 the truth is that it is a very very 

00:05:40.049 --> 00:05:43.829
 important that is one of the 

00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:46.169
 turtles with the strongest jaw 

00:05:43.829 --> 00:05:48.599
 world is worth 

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:51.539
 in this group of the full of 

00:05:48.599 --> 00:05:53.249
 shark crocodile of all these 

00:05:51.539 --> 00:05:55.330
 vouchers 

00:05:53.249 --> 00:05:57.159
 and well, nothing 

00:05:55.330 --> 00:06:01.150
 you know you have to be very careful 

00:05:57.159 --> 00:06:03.610
 especially those who have this this 

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:06.490
 species of turtle because you can not 

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:08.830
 run out of fingers or even without hands if it is 

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:11.129
 If it's already big breaks and weighs already 

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:14.050
 more than 100 kilos and more than 80 centimeters 

00:06:11.129 --> 00:06:18.599
 I can cut your hand perfectly from 

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:18.599
 a bite I say it for 

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:23.889
 not from experience because it has never 

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:26.229
 past this obviously but I know 

00:06:23.889 --> 00:06:28.750
 because I've seen three documentaries and there 

00:06:26.229 --> 00:06:30.610
 they tell it all good because nothing guys 

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:33.849
