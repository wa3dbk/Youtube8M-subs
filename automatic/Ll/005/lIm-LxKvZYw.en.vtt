00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
demonstration purposes some use the jog

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.890 
demonstration purposes some use the jog
wheel<00:01:24.270> to<00:01:25.020> bring<00:01:25.409> the<00:01:25.650> discs<00:01:25.979> around<00:01:26.900> that's

wheel to bring the discs around that's

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.810 
wheel to bring the discs around that's
pretty<00:01:28.229> much<00:01:28.380> in<00:01:28.590> real<00:01:28.770> time<00:01:29.100> when<00:01:29.400> you<00:01:29.520> do<00:01:29.670> it

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
pretty much in real time when you do it

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.730 
pretty much in real time when you do it
so<00:01:29.970> there<00:01:30.600> they<00:01:30.780> are<00:01:30.810> so<00:01:31.200> let's<00:01:31.380> say<00:01:31.530> that<00:01:31.680> I

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
just added a CD to the machine as you

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.679 
just added a CD to the machine as you
can<00:01:34.680> see<00:01:34.890> they<00:01:35.130> go<00:01:35.610> into<00:01:35.759> this<00:01:35.909> slot<00:01:36.240> you<00:01:36.509> put

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
can see they go into this slot you put

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.859 
can see they go into this slot you put
the<00:01:36.780> label<00:01:36.930> to<00:01:37.259> the<00:01:37.290> right<00:01:37.650> and<00:01:38.180> the<00:01:39.180> slots<00:01:39.509> are

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
the label to the right and the slots are

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.069 
the label to the right and the slots are
labeled<00:01:40.409> once<00:01:41.220> every<00:01:41.700> five<00:01:42.060> slots<00:01:42.659> with<00:01:43.049> the

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
labeled once every five slots with the

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.859 
labeled once every five slots with the
number<00:01:43.500> so<00:01:43.619> there's<00:01:43.799> 200<00:01:44.399> and<00:01:44.579> there's<00:01:44.729> one<00:01:45.030> so

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
number so there's 200 and there's one so

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.649 
number so there's 200 and there's one so
we'll<00:01:46.110> go<00:01:46.200> ahead<00:01:46.259> and<00:01:46.439> close<00:01:46.560> it<00:01:46.740> up<00:01:46.860> and<00:01:47.659> then

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
we'll go ahead and close it up and then

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.520 
we'll go ahead and close it up and then
it's<00:01:48.780> going<00:01:48.899> to<00:01:48.990> go<00:01:49.170> look<00:01:49.409> for<00:01:49.439> the<00:01:49.680> discs<00:01:50.479> and

it's going to go look for the discs and

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:56.719 
it's going to go look for the discs and
it<00:01:52.530> finds<00:01:52.829> discs<00:01:53.220> one<00:01:55.189> will<00:01:56.189> address<00:01:56.549> the

know where you can skip ahead on the
front<00:02:16.290> of<00:02:16.350> the<00:02:16.410> machine<00:02:16.710> but<00:02:16.890> there<00:02:17.070> is<00:02:17.190> on<00:02:17.370> the

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490 
front of the machine but there is on the

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:23.060 
front of the machine but there is on the
remote<00:02:17.820> so<00:02:18.600> let's<00:02:18.810> play<00:02:19.020> the<00:02:19.200> disk<00:02:21.170> and<00:02:22.170> there

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.070 
remote so let's play the disk and there

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
we have a CD playing now if we want to

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:28.310 
we have a CD playing now if we want to
go<00:02:26.970> to<00:02:27.000> another<00:02:27.330> disc<00:02:27.600> let's<00:02:27.900> say<00:02:28.080> that<00:02:28.200> we

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320 
go to another disc let's say that we

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.110 
go to another disc let's say that we
want<00:02:28.500> to<00:02:28.560> go<00:02:28.650> to<00:02:28.680> this<00:02:28.860> to<00:02:29.190> next<00:02:29.520> it's<00:02:29.820> already

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
want to go to this to next it's already

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.730 
want to go to this to next it's already
saying<00:02:30.330> the<00:02:30.450> two<00:02:30.630> is<00:02:30.750> next<00:02:31.050> so<00:02:31.170> I'll<00:02:31.290> say<00:02:31.500> three

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:31.740 
saying the two is next so I'll say three

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:34.580 
saying the two is next so I'll say three
I<00:02:32.100> just<00:02:32.850> turned<00:02:33.210> the<00:02:33.330> jog<00:02:33.570> wheel<00:02:33.810> and<00:02:34.410> if<00:02:34.500> I

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
I just turned the jog wheel and if I

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:37.220 
I just turned the jog wheel and if I
want<00:02:34.770> to<00:02:34.830> go<00:02:34.920> straight<00:02:35.130> to<00:02:35.400> it<00:02:35.810> hit<00:02:36.810> the<00:02:36.930> button

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
want to go straight to it hit the button

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:40.460 
want to go straight to it hit the button
and<00:02:37.580> it<00:02:38.580> unloads<00:02:39.000> that<00:02:39.330> first<00:02:39.600> disc<00:02:39.870> and<00:02:40.290> it's

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
and it unloads that first disc and it's

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.300 
and it unloads that first disc and it's
going<00:02:40.590> to<00:02:40.650> load<00:02:40.830> up<00:02:40.980> three<00:02:41.250> and<00:02:41.400> start<00:02:41.700> to<00:02:41.850> play

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
going to load up three and start to play

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:53.480 
going to load up three and start to play
and<00:02:45.080> here<00:02:46.080> we<00:02:46.170> go<00:02:50.090> and<00:02:51.680> Peter<00:02:52.680> Gabriel<00:02:53.130> starts

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:53.490

hands here sorry about that and we're on

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:22.340 
hands here sorry about that and we're on
disc<00:03:19.590> two<00:03:19.890> now<00:03:20.190> and<00:03:20.750> multiply<00:03:21.750> that<00:03:21.900> by<00:03:21.960> 200

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 
disc two now and multiply that by 200

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:24.520 
disc two now and multiply that by 200
and<00:03:22.860> you<00:03:22.890> have<00:03:23.070> the<00:03:23.220> operation<00:03:23.640> of<00:03:23.970> a<00:03:24.060> machine

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:24.530 
and you have the operation of a machine

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:28.250 
and you have the operation of a machine
now<00:03:25.530> the<00:03:25.590> remote<00:03:25.920> control<00:03:26.340> has<00:03:26.580> more<00:03:27.260> features

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
now the remote control has more features

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.700 
now the remote control has more features
on<00:03:28.680> it<00:03:28.860> the<00:03:29.730> remote<00:03:30.000> control<00:03:30.420> allows<00:03:30.840> you<00:03:31.350> to

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:31.710 
on it the remote control allows you to

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:34.550 
on it the remote control allows you to
do<00:03:32.070> all<00:03:33.060> kinds<00:03:33.570> of<00:03:33.630> different<00:03:33.720> programming<00:03:34.470> if

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
do all kinds of different programming if

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.830 
do all kinds of different programming if
you<00:03:34.650> notice<00:03:34.950> here<00:03:35.330> you<00:03:36.330> have<00:03:36.480> the<00:03:36.630> pretty

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
you notice here you have the pretty

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.770 
you notice here you have the pretty
standard<00:03:37.350> ones<00:03:38.310> here<00:03:38.580> this<00:03:38.760> and<00:03:38.970> you<00:03:39.450> can<00:03:39.630> tell

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780 
standard ones here this and you can tell

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:41.300 
standard ones here this and you can tell
it<00:03:39.900> just<00:03:39.930> to<00:03:40.110> play<00:03:40.260> one<00:03:40.470> disc<00:03:40.680> at<00:03:40.830> a<00:03:40.920> time<00:03:41.130> and

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
it just to play one disc at a time and

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:42.770 
it just to play one disc at a time and
don't<00:03:41.400> do<00:03:41.610> anything<00:03:41.880> that's<00:03:42.240> the<00:03:42.360> continue

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
don't do anything that's the continue

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.200 
don't do anything that's the continue
button<00:03:42.810> and<00:03:43.230> then<00:03:43.860> there's<00:03:44.100> a<00:03:44.160> shuffle<00:03:45.090> and

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:45.210 
button and then there's a shuffle and

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:47.990 
button and then there's a shuffle and
program<00:03:45.690> and<00:03:46.050> repeat<00:03:46.440> here<00:03:46.890> you<00:03:47.460> can<00:03:47.610> set<00:03:47.850> that

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
program and repeat here you can set that

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.150 
program and repeat here you can set that
up<00:03:48.060> and<00:03:48.390> these<00:03:48.600> down<00:03:48.870> here<00:03:48.900> are<00:03:49.200> blocks<00:03:49.800> that

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
up and these down here are blocks that

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.250 
up and these down here are blocks that
you<00:03:50.340> can<00:03:50.520> program<00:03:50.760> you<00:03:51.510> can<00:03:51.720> program<00:03:51.930> the

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
you can program you can program the

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.920 
you can program you can program the
machine<00:03:52.590> to<00:03:52.830> like<00:03:53.010> play<00:03:53.330> three<00:03:54.330> discs<00:03:54.810> and

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
machine to like play three discs and

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:57.410 
machine to like play three discs and
then<00:03:55.170> stop<00:03:55.560> and<00:03:55.920> I'm<00:03:56.790> not<00:03:56.940> quite<00:03:57.120> sure<00:03:57.180> how

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:57.420
