to<00:01:31.840> a<00:01:31.869> nintendo<00:01:32.350> system<00:01:32.619> and<00:01:33.069> it's<00:01:33.939> an<00:01:34.090> MMO<00:01:34.479> so

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:34.840 
to a nintendo system and it's an MMO so

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:36.269 
to a nintendo system and it's an MMO so
that's<00:01:35.020> definitely<00:01:35.259> a<00:01:35.469> good<00:01:35.679> thing<00:01:35.709> in<00:01:35.950> Tendo

00:01:36.269 --> 00:01:36.279 
that's definitely a good thing in Tendo

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
think explorers is coming to North

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:11.729 
think explorers is coming to North
America<00:02:10.179> at<00:02:10.659> this<00:02:10.810> point<00:02:11.110> now<00:02:11.260> and<00:02:11.530> there's

00:02:11.729 --> 00:02:11.739 
America at this point now and there's

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:13.450 
America at this point now and there's
been<00:02:11.890> plenty<00:02:12.189> of<00:02:12.459> other<00:02:12.700> games<00:02:12.909> that<00:02:13.060> they

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:13.460 
been plenty of other games that they

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:15.580 
been plenty of other games that they
out<00:02:13.670> on<00:02:13.850> there<00:02:14.060> so<00:02:14.300> I<00:02:14.510> think<00:02:14.780> that<00:02:15.020> whole<00:02:15.350> thing

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
out on there so I think that whole thing

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.800 
out on there so I think that whole thing
is<00:02:15.860> over<00:02:16.160> with<00:02:16.490> and<00:02:16.850> hopefully<00:02:17.420> the

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
is over with and hopefully the

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:19.180 
is over with and hopefully the
attendance<00:02:18.230> grant<00:02:18.560> is<00:02:18.680> can<00:02:18.860> form<00:02:19.100> a

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
attendance grant is can form a

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:21.010 
attendance grant is can form a
relationship<00:02:19.370> to<00:02:20.300> where<00:02:20.390> they<00:02:20.510> get<00:02:20.690> back<00:02:20.870> to

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:21.020 
relationship to where they get back to

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:22.690 
relationship to where they get back to
producing<00:02:21.410> a<00:02:21.590> lot<00:02:21.830> of<00:02:21.950> games<00:02:22.190> I<00:02:22.340> nintendo

platinum games that's awesome that's

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:38.140 
platinum games that's awesome that's
something<00:02:37.100> that<00:02:37.130> I<00:02:37.280> would<00:02:37.460> love<00:02:37.640> to<00:02:37.700> have<00:02:38.000> on<00:02:38.120> a

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
something that I would love to have on a

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.330 
something that I would love to have on a
min<00:02:38.360> Tendo<00:02:38.690> consoles<00:02:39.230> so<00:02:39.500> it's<00:02:39.980> one<00:02:40.190> of<00:02:40.250> those

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
min Tendo consoles so it's one of those

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.280 
min Tendo consoles so it's one of those
things<00:02:40.430> where<00:02:40.730> Square<00:02:41.210> Enix<00:02:41.390> in<00:02:41.660> kendo<00:02:42.020> I

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.290 
things where Square Enix in kendo I

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:44.260 
things where Square Enix in kendo I
think<00:02:43.130> they<00:02:43.640> could<00:02:43.880> have<00:02:43.910> a<00:02:44.060> good

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:44.270 
think they could have a good

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:46.090 
think they could have a good
relationship<00:02:44.390> and<00:02:45.020> they<00:02:45.320> could<00:02:45.560> make<00:02:45.800> a<00:02:45.830> lot

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:46.100 
relationship and they could make a lot

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:47.350 
relationship and they could make a lot
of<00:02:46.160> money<00:02:46.280> together<00:02:46.670> because<00:02:47.030> really<00:02:47.210> that's

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 
of money together because really that's

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:48.910 
of money together because really that's
what<00:02:47.570> it<00:02:47.660> is<00:02:47.780> in<00:02:47.990> the<00:02:48.080> end<00:02:48.230> it's<00:02:48.650> just<00:02:48.710> a

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
what it is in the end it's just a

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:50.980 
what it is in the end it's just a
business<00:02:49.340> and<00:02:49.520> what<00:02:49.610> the<00:02:49.730> xbox<00:02:50.180> one<00:02:50.390> not<00:02:50.660> doing

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:50.990 
business and what the xbox one not doing

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:54.850 
business and what the xbox one not doing
so<00:02:51.260> good<00:02:51.530> in<00:02:51.830> Japan<00:02:52.280> and<00:02:52.580> the<00:02:52.610> ps4<00:02:53.060> also<00:02:53.990> doing

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:54.860 
so good in Japan and the ps4 also doing

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:57.880 
so good in Japan and the ps4 also doing
way<00:02:55.130> better<00:02:55.160> than<00:02:55.580> xbox<00:02:55.940> one<00:02:56.330> but<00:02:56.660> not<00:02:56.990> great<00:02:57.410> I

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:57.890 
way better than xbox one but not great I

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:59.920 
way better than xbox one but not great I
think<00:02:58.340> it<00:02:58.430> would<00:02:58.520> be<00:02:58.550> good<00:02:58.820> for<00:02:58.880> square<00:02:59.540> enix

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930 
think it would be good for square enix

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:01.870 
think it would be good for square enix
to<00:03:00.140> actually<00:03:00.920> team<00:03:01.130> up<00:03:01.220> with<00:03:01.400> Nintendo

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:01.880 
to actually team up with Nintendo

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.810 
to actually team up with Nintendo
because<00:03:02.150> they<00:03:02.270> know<00:03:02.540> NX<00:03:02.900> could<00:03:03.460> easily<00:03:04.460> sell

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:04.820 
because they know NX could easily sell

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:07.510 
because they know NX could easily sell
as<00:03:05.060> much<00:03:05.330> or<00:03:05.690> near<00:03:06.380> what<00:03:06.980> the<00:03:07.280> current

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:07.520 
as much or near what the current

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790 
Nintendo plays their cards right so I

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:15.310 
Nintendo plays their cards right so I
think<00:03:14.060> just<00:03:14.420> in<00:03:14.540> general<00:03:14.570> it's<00:03:15.050> a<00:03:15.140> good

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:15.320 
think just in general it's a good

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:17.920 
think just in general it's a good

considering it hopefully we can put

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:03.850 
considering it hopefully we can put
something<00:04:01.940> together<00:04:02.120> and<00:04:02.600> that's<00:04:03.200> more<00:04:03.620> than

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:03.860 
something together and that's more than

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:24.330 
Western developers and it just didn't

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:26.300 
Western developers and it just didn't
seem<00:04:24.510> right<00:04:24.570> at<00:04:24.870> some<00:04:25.290> times<00:04:25.560> but<00:04:25.680> with<00:04:26.070> square

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:26.310 
seem right at some times but with square

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:27.920 
seem right at some times but with square
headaches<00:04:26.639> so<00:04:26.970> just<00:04:27.180> coming<00:04:27.449> out<00:04:27.540> and<00:04:27.600> saying
