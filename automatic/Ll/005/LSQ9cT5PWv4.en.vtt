00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.296
 We are now at the moment with the band of Paços de Ferreira, of Metal. 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.902
 They are the Apotheos. 

00:00:22.159 --> 00:00:23.100
 - And it's true. 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.000
 It is true. 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.480
 Albano then, Michael, James and Paul, are the constituents. 

00:00:27.734 --> 00:00:33.279
 And they will now release their EP - "A Quest to Remain" in September 2010, 

00:00:33.604 --> 00:00:36.900
 by the publisher Raising Legends, who is also the promoter of this event. 

00:00:36.315 --> 00:00:38.200
 Albano, good evening. 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:38.500
 - Good night. 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.650
 How do you see the band right now? 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.800
 I see that the band has a lot of work right now. 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.250
 We have to "give a lot to the 

00:00:51.599 --> 00:00:55.130
 follow the objectives set by the publisher 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:00.200
 to get a good reception by the fans. 

00:01:00.617 --> 00:01:02.565
 The concerts have been really brutal, 

00:01:03.511 --> 00:01:06.900
 today is going to be the best. We'll be in Porto tomorrow, but it does not matter. 

00:01:09.638 --> 00:01:10.638
 We have to kick the ball forward. 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.586
 What's it like to play at home? 

00:01:13.791 --> 00:01:14.791
 "What's it like to play at home?" 

00:01:15.284 --> 00:01:18.800
 Honestly, in a non-musician condition 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:21.400
 as event planner in the area: 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.160
 During this year I was to organize concerts here, of metal and rock 

00:01:25.161 --> 00:01:29.600
 and I see that this public pacense is a shame, in quotes, 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:32.300
 because they complain that in Paços de Ferreira there is never anything ... 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:34.600
 And there. Constantly. 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:36.158
 No one shows up. 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:39.765
 Epah, but we hope there's a "twist" on the thing today. 

00:01:40.093 --> 00:01:41.093
 We will see. 

00:01:41.501 --> 00:01:43.470
 Within the metal world, 

00:01:43.501 --> 00:01:46.800
 is there a genre in which you like to insert yourself more 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.200
 or just like to sail before the specter of metal? 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.862
 - We have influences from Death, 

00:01:54.898 --> 00:01:57.140
 we have very melodic Death influences. 

00:01:57.782 --> 00:02:00.700
 We have a lot of progressive influence, too. 

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:04.600
 And that's where we want to be, Melodic and Progressive Death. 

00:02:05.461 --> 00:02:09.000
 How do you see the state of the metal in Portugal? 

00:02:09.152 --> 00:02:11.100
 Have we evolved positively? 

00:02:11.118 --> 00:02:12.118
 Is there more offer? 

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:15.890
 And that will be good for the bands too? Makes them more competitive, or not? 

00:02:16.213 --> 00:02:21.400
 - I think metal in Portugal is getting better and more diversified. 

00:02:21.837 --> 00:02:24.560
 Or it is I who am entering myself more and more. 

00:02:24.878 --> 00:02:27.478
 But I do not think so. I think not. 

00:02:28.151 --> 00:02:31.530
 Bands like ... it does not matter now to say the name, but of varied styles, 

00:02:31.536 --> 00:02:37.250
 viking metal and styles that one might never think of being born in Portugal. 

00:02:37.562 --> 00:02:41.059
 Until now there is the Lusitanian Metal. There is Lusitanian Metal. 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:45.900
 There's a lot of creativity here and I think this goes forward. 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:50.191
 Any messages for the fans, who want to leave? 

00:02:51.874 --> 00:02:55.712
 Above all, thank you very much. Thanks for their support. 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:57.470
 And always appear. 

00:02:58.212 --> 00:03:01.600
 It will be then the beginning of the festival "Rock in Paços". 

00:03:01.916 --> 00:03:02.865
 Apotheus. 

00:03:02.865 --> 00:03:03.865
 Biolence. 

00:03:03.865 --> 00:03:04.610
 Daemogorgon. 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:05.610
 And also Pitch Black. 

00:03:06.454 --> 00:03:09.373
 Today, the 30th of July, an unprecedented festival. 

00:03:09.506 --> 00:03:11.400
 Be around. It was then the IndieFront. 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:12.437
 - First edition! 

00:03:12.692 --> 00:03:13.825
 We must mention the first edition of this festival. 

00:03:13.825 --> 00:03:14.962
 And there are many. 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:16.416
 Thank you. Good night.
