00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
billion times it collides a lot better

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:44.480

Turkey<00:02:08.039> I<00:02:08.280> would<00:02:08.910> to<00:02:09.630> balance<00:02:10.050> that<00:02:10.259> out<00:02:10.320> now

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
Turkey I would to balance that out now

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.920 
Turkey I would to balance that out now
you<00:02:10.740> want<00:02:10.979> to<00:02:11.070> put<00:02:11.220> these<00:02:11.370> in<00:02:11.600> where<00:02:12.600> the<00:02:12.690> flat

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
you want to put these in where the flat

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:14.660 
you want to put these in where the flat
side<00:02:13.230> of<00:02:13.350> the<00:02:13.410> key<00:02:13.620> is<00:02:13.770> on<00:02:13.920> the<00:02:14.040> flat<00:02:14.280> side<00:02:14.520> of

side of the key is on the flat side of

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.000 
side of the key is on the flat side of
the<00:02:14.760> bar<00:02:14.970> and<00:02:15.720> because<00:02:16.170> the<00:02:16.410> screw<00:02:16.710> lights

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
the bar and because the screw lights

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.300 
the bar and because the screw lights
don't<00:02:17.280> work<00:02:17.610> for<00:02:17.940> me<00:02:18.120> I'm<00:02:19.100> doubling<00:02:20.100> up<00:02:20.280> the

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
don't work for me I'm doubling up the

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.790 
don't work for me I'm doubling up the
washers<00:02:20.940> in<00:02:21.090> between<00:02:21.510> short<00:02:22.020> screw<00:02:22.320> does<00:02:22.560> not

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
washers in between short screw does not

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.960 
washers in between short screw does not
work<00:02:23.100> in<00:02:23.610> my<00:02:24.420> case

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
work in my case

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:33.280 
work in my case
so<00:02:26.970> I'm<00:02:27.060> putting<00:02:27.360> two<00:02:27.600> arches<00:02:28.080> in<00:02:28.260> between<00:02:32.060> and

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
so I'm putting two arches in between and

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:42.160 
so I'm putting two arches in between and
in<00:02:34.290> this<00:02:34.410> case<00:02:36.260> I'm<00:02:37.260> putting<00:02:38.010> in<00:02:38.780> this<00:02:39.780> key

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:48.920 

opposite<00:02:43.170> this<00:02:43.739> key<00:02:46.910> to<00:02:47.910> more<00:02:48.120> washers

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
opposite this key to more washers

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:55.070 
opposite this key to more washers
I<00:02:52.970> think<00:02:53.970> these<00:02:54.150> holes<00:02:54.390> should<00:02:54.660> have<00:02:54.810> been<00:02:54.959> a

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080 
I think these holes should have been a

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.360 
I think these holes should have been a
little<00:02:55.470> farther<00:02:55.709> apart

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
little farther apart

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.870 
little farther apart
I<00:02:56.580> think<00:02:57.570> the<00:02:57.660> circle<00:02:58.110> should<00:02:58.320> have<00:02:58.410> been<00:02:58.500> a

00:02:58.870 --> 00:02:58.880 
I think the circle should have been a

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:01.880 
I think the circle should have been a
either<00:02:59.880> bigger<00:03:00.180> or<00:03:00.480> smaller<00:03:00.750> if<00:03:01.350> you<00:03:01.620> want<00:03:01.830> to

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
either bigger or smaller if you want to

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:04.550 
either bigger or smaller if you want to
twirl<00:03:02.700> the<00:03:03.180> keys<00:03:03.420> out<00:03:03.660> by<00:03:03.989> the<00:03:04.050> head<00:03:04.320> of<00:03:04.350> the

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
twirl the keys out by the head of the

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.280 
twirl the keys out by the head of the
key<00:03:04.739> they<00:03:04.920> should<00:03:05.130> have<00:03:05.220> been<00:03:05.280> smaller<00:03:05.930> now<00:03:06.930> I

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
key they should have been smaller now I

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.850 
key they should have been smaller now I
have<00:03:07.770> to<00:03:07.890> do<00:03:07.980> the<00:03:08.100> same<00:03:08.340> thing<00:03:08.610> here<00:03:08.820> with<00:03:08.970> a

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
large key down stock by a small key now

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:22.699 
large key down stock by a small key now
here's<00:03:21.390> where<00:03:21.540> this<00:03:21.780> is<00:03:21.989> the<00:03:22.110> most<00:03:22.260> handy

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:34.180 
I can remove this thing which was

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:39.900 
I can remove this thing which was
holding<00:04:34.540> the<00:04:34.750> mess<00:04:34.960> all<00:04:35.199> together<00:04:36.930> and<00:04:38.910> put

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:39.910 
holding the mess all together and put

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:45.330 
holding the mess all together and put
the<00:04:40.030> desired<00:04:40.419> amount<00:04:40.660> of<00:04:41.050> compression<00:04:44.340> it's

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:45.340 
the desired amount of compression it's

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:48.540 
the desired amount of compression it's
compression<00:04:45.820> that<00:04:46.150> tension<00:04:47.190> on<00:04:48.190> the<00:04:48.370> whole

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:48.550 
compression that tension on the whole

00:04:48.550 --> 00:05:01.950 
compression that tension on the whole
system<00:04:59.729> like<00:05:00.729> I<00:05:00.880> say<00:05:01.120> I<00:05:01.150> doubled<00:05:01.690> up<00:05:01.750> on<00:05:01.900> the

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:01.960 
system like I say I doubled up on the

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:04.230 
system like I say I doubled up on the
washers<00:05:02.470> because<00:05:03.130> the<00:05:03.310> short<00:05:03.610> screws<00:05:04.000> were

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:04.240 
washers because the short screws were

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:06.090 
washers because the short screws were
well<00:05:04.900> they<00:05:05.020> weren't<00:05:05.169> even<00:05:05.410> reaching<00:05:05.740> with<00:05:05.889> one

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:06.100 
well they weren't even reaching with one

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:09.960 
well they weren't even reaching with one
washer<00:05:06.610> and<00:05:07.139> these<00:05:08.139> not<00:05:08.680> middle<00:05:09.220> size<00:05:09.460> screws

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:09.970 
washer and these not middle size screws

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:14.460 
washer and these not middle size screws
do<00:05:10.539> stick<00:05:10.900> out<00:05:11.139> a<00:05:11.169> bit<00:05:12.810> boy<00:05:13.810> this<00:05:14.020> took<00:05:14.289> me<00:05:14.440> a

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:14.470 
do stick out a bit boy this took me a

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:16.589 
do stick out a bit boy this took me a
fraction<00:05:15.220> with<00:05:15.729> the<00:05:15.849> tape<00:05:16.090> why<00:05:16.360> didn't<00:05:16.539> I

00:05:16.589 --> 00:05:16.599 
fraction with the tape why didn't I

00:05:16.599 --> 00:05:21.529 
fraction with the tape why didn't I
think<00:05:16.630> of<00:05:16.990> that<00:05:17.050> earlier<00:05:19.650> and<00:05:20.650> there<00:05:20.830> it<00:05:20.950> is

00:05:21.529 --> 00:05:21.539 
think of that earlier and there it is

00:05:21.539 --> 00:05:26.180 
think of that earlier and there it is
flats<00:05:22.539> against<00:05:23.020> the<00:05:23.139> flat<00:05:24.479> you<00:05:25.479> can<00:05:25.720> now

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:26.190 
flats against the flat you can now

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:28.529 
flats against the flat you can now
because<00:05:27.190> I've<00:05:27.340> doubled<00:05:27.729> up<00:05:27.849> on<00:05:27.970> the<00:05:28.090> washer<00:05:28.419> it

00:05:28.529 --> 00:05:28.539 
because I've doubled up on the washer it

00:05:28.539 --> 00:05:31.050 
because I've doubled up on the washer it
makes<00:05:28.720> the<00:05:28.900> bar<00:05:29.110> wider<00:05:29.680> thicker<00:05:30.280> but<00:05:30.490> you<00:05:30.910> can

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:31.060 
makes the bar wider thicker but you can

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:33.120 
makes the bar wider thicker but you can
get<00:05:31.210> your<00:05:31.360> fingers<00:05:31.750> in<00:05:31.780> there<00:05:31.960> to<00:05:32.680> push<00:05:32.889> out

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:33.130 
get your fingers in there to push out

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:34.800 
get your fingers in there to push out
your<00:05:33.340> keys<00:05:33.550> that's<00:05:33.910> one<00:05:34.090> way<00:05:34.270> of<00:05:34.389> doing<00:05:34.539> it

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:34.810 
your keys that's one way of doing it

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:36.990 
your keys that's one way of doing it
another<00:05:35.560> way<00:05:35.770> of<00:05:35.889> doing<00:05:36.130> it<00:05:36.250> is<00:05:36.340> rolling<00:05:36.700> them

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:37.000 
another way of doing it is rolling them

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.940 
another way of doing it is rolling them
out<00:05:37.120> like<00:05:37.389> this<00:05:37.660> okay

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:40.950 

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:44.370 

all<00:05:41.950> right<00:05:42.130> the<00:05:42.310> key<00:05:42.490> bar<00:05:42.750> this<00:05:43.750> is<00:05:43.810> not<00:05:44.229> the

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:44.380 
all right the key bar this is not the

to buy a 16 gigabyte flash drive thumb
drive<00:06:12.580> that<00:06:13.090> that<00:06:13.390> fits<00:06:13.690> in<00:06:13.900> here<00:06:14.110> I<00:06:14.140> think<00:06:14.530> I

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:14.680 
drive that that fits in here I think I

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:17.020

think<00:06:15.340> now<00:06:15.729> instead<00:06:16.210> of<00:06:16.270> just<00:06:16.360> a<00:06:16.599> key

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:17.030 
think now instead of just a key

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:20.140 
think now instead of just a key
thing<00:06:17.690> it<00:06:18.500> becomes<00:06:19.070> what<00:06:19.340> dennis<00:06:19.640> whale<00:06:19.820> calls

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:20.150 
thing it becomes what dennis whale calls

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:22.840 
thing it becomes what dennis whale calls
a<00:06:20.330> homemade<00:06:20.840> multi-tool<00:06:21.710> I<00:06:22.040> think<00:06:22.610> having

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:22.850 
a homemade multi-tool I think having

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:26.650 
a homemade multi-tool I think having
those<00:06:23.210> two<00:06:23.600> tools<00:06:23.900> the<00:06:24.610> screwdrivers<00:06:25.660> plus

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:26.660 
those two tools the screwdrivers plus

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:31.180 
those two tools the screwdrivers plus
the<00:06:28.390> plus<00:06:29.390> the<00:06:29.420> flash<00:06:29.810> drive<00:06:30.200> really<00:06:30.530> gives<00:06:30.980> us

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:31.190 
the plus the flash drive really gives us

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:33.970 
the plus the flash drive really gives us
some<00:06:31.400> versatility<00:06:32.180> here<00:06:32.390> and<00:06:33.200> that<00:06:33.440> can't

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:33.980 
some versatility here and that can't

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:35.800 
some versatility here and that can't
wait<00:06:34.160> for<00:06:34.340> them<00:06:34.460> to<00:06:34.520> get<00:06:34.670> in<00:06:34.850> it<00:06:35.390> will<00:06:35.630> be

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:35.810 
wait for them to get in it will be

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:37.690 
wait for them to get in it will be
thicker<00:06:36.230> yeah<00:06:36.500> sure<00:06:36.830> it'll<00:06:37.010> be<00:06:37.160> thicker<00:06:37.430> but

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:37.700 
thicker yeah sure it'll be thicker but

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:39.070 
thicker yeah sure it'll be thicker but
look<00:06:37.880> you<00:06:38.000> know<00:06:38.150> it's<00:06:38.420> holding<00:06:38.750> a<00:06:38.810> lot<00:06:38.960> of

00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:39.080 
look you know it's holding a lot of

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:41.410 
look you know it's holding a lot of
stuff<00:06:39.380> but<00:06:39.920> the<00:06:40.070> thicker<00:06:40.310> I<00:06:40.580> guess<00:06:40.880> a<00:06:41.030> makes<00:06:41.270> it

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:41.420 
stuff but the thicker I guess a makes it

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:43.540 
stuff but the thicker I guess a makes it
easier<00:06:41.780> get<00:06:42.080> your<00:06:42.230> fingers<00:06:42.530> in<00:06:42.710> there<00:06:42.860> and

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:43.550 
easier get your fingers in there and

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:45.310 
easier get your fingers in there and
pull<00:06:43.820> your<00:06:43.970> tools<00:06:44.240> out<00:06:44.450> if<00:06:44.660> you're<00:06:44.810> not<00:06:44.840> fond

pull your tools out if you're not fond
