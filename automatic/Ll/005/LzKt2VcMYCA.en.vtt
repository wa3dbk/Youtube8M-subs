shoulder<00:01:55.950> away<00:01:56.659> moving<00:01:57.659> the<00:01:57.750> shoulder<00:01:58.290> is

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
shoulder away moving the shoulder is

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.889 
shoulder away moving the shoulder is
basically<00:01:59.549> a<00:01:59.700> function<00:02:00.000> of<00:02:00.329> what<00:02:00.479> we<00:02:00.630> call<00:02:00.869> a

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
basically a function of what we call a

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:04.520 
basically a function of what we call a
counter<00:02:01.530> arc<00:02:01.829> now<00:02:02.700> not<00:02:03.509> everybody<00:02:04.020> uses<00:02:04.320> it

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
counter arc now not everybody uses it

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.069 
counter arc now not everybody uses it
quite<00:02:04.920> the<00:02:05.100> same<00:02:05.369> but<00:02:05.969> we<00:02:06.119> want<00:02:06.329> to<00:02:06.479> be<00:02:06.600> able<00:02:06.719> to

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
quite the same but we want to be able to

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:10.249 
quite the same but we want to be able to
bring<00:02:07.649> the<00:02:07.829> horse's<00:02:08.250> nose<00:02:08.489> outside<00:02:09.080> or<00:02:10.080> at

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
bring the horse's nose outside or at

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:11.809 
bring the horse's nose outside or at
least<00:02:10.440> keep<00:02:10.679> it<00:02:10.800> straight<00:02:11.129> we<00:02:11.340> want<00:02:11.580> to<00:02:11.670> keep

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
least keep it straight we want to keep

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.580 
least keep it straight we want to keep
his<00:02:11.970> body<00:02:12.150> straight<00:02:12.599> so<00:02:12.870> the<00:02:12.989> shoulder<00:02:13.379> moves

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
his body straight so the shoulder moves

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:13.980 
his body straight so the shoulder moves
and<00:02:13.770> he

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:13.990 
and he

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:16.980 
and he
doesn't<00:02:14.350> go<00:02:14.550> so<00:02:15.550> we<00:02:16.150> hold<00:02:16.420> his<00:02:16.600> shoulder

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:16.990 
doesn't go so we hold his shoulder

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:19.410 
doesn't go so we hold his shoulder
straight<00:02:17.310> his<00:02:18.310> head<00:02:18.520> straight<00:02:18.850> to<00:02:19.060> the<00:02:19.090> movies

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
straight his head straight to the movies

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.600 
straight his head straight to the movies
shoulder<00:02:19.870> so<00:02:20.380> we<00:02:20.620> call<00:02:20.830> it<00:02:20.860> a<00:02:21.070> counter<00:02:21.400> art

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
shoulder so we call it a counter art

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:23.210 
shoulder so we call it a counter art
because<00:02:22.000> the<00:02:22.150> head<00:02:22.390> is<00:02:22.420> to<00:02:22.690> the<00:02:22.780> outside

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
because the head is to the outside

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.920 
because the head is to the outside
shoulders<00:02:24.220> to<00:02:24.400> the<00:02:24.430> inside<00:02:24.970> so<00:02:25.570> we're<00:02:25.780> going

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
shoulders to the inside so we're going

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:29.580 
shoulders to the inside so we're going
to<00:02:26.020> walk<00:02:26.260> this<00:02:26.560> horse<00:02:26.890> in<00:02:27.100> a<00:02:27.190> circle<00:02:28.380> with<00:02:29.380> his

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
to walk this horse in a circle with his

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:32.520 
to walk this horse in a circle with his
head<00:02:29.800> to<00:02:29.950> the<00:02:30.070> outside<00:02:30.580> and<00:02:30.930> the<00:02:31.930> nose<00:02:32.170> to<00:02:32.410> the

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
head to the outside and the nose to the

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:35.940 
head to the outside and the nose to the
inside<00:02:33.510> and<00:02:34.510> we<00:02:34.900> just<00:02:35.110> keep<00:02:35.290> bumping<00:02:35.620> with

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
inside and we just keep bumping with

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:37.500 
inside and we just keep bumping with
this<00:02:36.160> leg<00:02:36.400> getting<00:02:36.760> that<00:02:36.910> horse<00:02:37.180> to<00:02:37.360> move

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
this leg getting that horse to move

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:40.320 
this leg getting that horse to move
across<00:02:38.220> all<00:02:39.220> right<00:02:39.340> when<00:02:39.550> he's<00:02:39.670> moving<00:02:39.910> good

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.330 
across all right when he's moving good

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:43.800 
across all right when he's moving good
you<00:02:40.540> sit<00:02:40.810> still<00:02:41.110> if<00:02:42.100> he<00:02:42.190> resists<00:02:42.910> you<00:02:43.570> just

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
you sit still if he resists you just

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:45.510 
you sit still if he resists you just
kind<00:02:44.050> of<00:02:44.110> bump<00:02:44.350> and<00:02:44.710> get<00:02:45.040> him<00:02:45.160> to<00:02:45.250> move<00:02:45.370> a

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:45.520 
kind of bump and get him to move a

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:48.000 
kind of bump and get him to move a
little<00:02:45.640> bit<00:02:45.760> more<00:02:46.060> now<00:02:46.810> as<00:02:47.050> he<00:02:47.260> gets<00:02:47.290> better<00:02:47.800> at

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
little bit more now as he gets better at

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:51.120 
little bit more now as he gets better at
that<00:02:48.220> and<00:02:48.510> everything<00:02:49.510> that<00:02:49.690> we<00:02:49.840> do<00:02:50.110> when<00:02:50.920> we

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130 
that and everything that we do when we

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:53.790 
that and everything that we do when we
speed<00:02:51.520> up<00:02:51.760> the<00:02:52.450> maneuver<00:02:52.900> gets<00:02:53.110> harder<00:02:53.560> and

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:53.800 
speed up the maneuver gets harder and

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:55.560 
speed up the maneuver gets harder and
the<00:02:54.580> horses<00:02:54.850> will<00:02:55.120> be<00:02:55.150> a<00:02:55.240> little<00:02:55.450> more

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:55.570 
the horses will be a little more

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:57.660 
the horses will be a little more
resistant<00:02:56.170> so<00:02:56.680> if<00:02:56.830> you're<00:02:57.040> trotting<00:02:57.520> and

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670 
resistant so if you're trotting and

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:59.550 
resistant so if you're trotting and
trying<00:02:57.970> to<00:02:58.090> do<00:02:58.210> a<00:02:58.240> counter<00:02:58.690> arc<00:02:58.900> and<00:02:59.140> he<00:02:59.200> starts

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
trying to do a counter arc and he starts

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.640 
trying to do a counter arc and he starts
resisting<00:03:00.100> go<00:03:00.280> back<00:03:00.460> to<00:03:00.670> the<00:03:00.760> walk<00:03:01.020> so<00:03:02.020> we're

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
resisting go back to the walk so we're

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:07.230 
resisting go back to the walk so we're
going<00:03:02.770> to<00:03:02.860> ask<00:03:03.040> the<00:03:03.190> horse<00:03:03.310> to<00:03:03.430> trot<00:03:06.060> I'm<00:03:07.060> gonna

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:07.240 
going to ask the horse to trot I'm gonna

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:09.900 
going to ask the horse to trot I'm gonna
pick<00:03:07.450> up<00:03:07.630> this<00:03:07.810> outside<00:03:08.350> rein<00:03:08.650> and<00:03:08.980> move<00:03:09.790> the

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:09.910 
pick up this outside rein and move the

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:11.670 
pick up this outside rein and move the
shoulder<00:03:10.360> so<00:03:10.570> the<00:03:10.720> shoulder<00:03:11.140> is<00:03:11.200> going<00:03:11.260> across

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 
shoulder so the shoulder is going across

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.510 
shoulder so the shoulder is going across
and<00:03:12.390> making<00:03:13.390> the<00:03:13.900> hips<00:03:14.110> going<00:03:14.650> in<00:03:14.860> a<00:03:14.920> small

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:15.520 
and making the hips going in a small

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:18.060 
and making the hips going in a small
circle<00:03:16.090> shoulders<00:03:16.960> going<00:03:17.290> in<00:03:17.440> a<00:03:17.560> larger

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:18.070 
circle shoulders going in a larger

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:20.040 
circle shoulders going in a larger
circle<00:03:18.310> and<00:03:19.030> the<00:03:19.180> shoulder<00:03:19.540> moving<00:03:19.720> across

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:20.050 
circle and the shoulder moving across

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:23.280 
circle and the shoulder moving across
this<00:03:20.800> gives<00:03:21.220> us<00:03:21.400> our<00:03:21.640> guide<00:03:21.970> so<00:03:22.840> that<00:03:23.020> if<00:03:23.110> we're

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.290 
this gives us our guide so that if we're

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:24.810 
this gives us our guide so that if we're
loping<00:03:23.680> the<00:03:23.770> horse<00:03:23.980> down<00:03:24.190> the<00:03:24.310> pen<00:03:24.550> and<00:03:24.760> we

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:24.820 
loping the horse down the pen and we

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:26.970 
loping the horse down the pen and we
just<00:03:25.030> drag<00:03:25.330> our<00:03:25.510> neck<00:03:25.720> rein<00:03:26.020> the<00:03:26.560> horse<00:03:26.770> will

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:26.980 
just drag our neck rein the horse will

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:29.550 
just drag our neck rein the horse will
go<00:03:27.010> the<00:03:27.280> direction<00:03:27.700> we<00:03:27.820> want<00:03:28.030> them<00:03:28.150> to<00:03:28.180> go<00:03:28.560> now

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:29.560 
go the direction we want them to go now

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:32.550 
go the direction we want them to go now
as<00:03:29.800> they<00:03:30.370> get<00:03:30.610> better<00:03:30.880> at<00:03:31.090> that<00:03:31.390> we'll<00:03:32.230> go<00:03:32.500> to

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:32.560 
as they get better at that we'll go to

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:37.160 
as they get better at that we'll go to
the<00:03:32.830> to<00:03:33.250> the<00:03:33.460> lope<00:03:33.880> and<00:03:34.120> do<00:03:34.750> the<00:03:34.900> same<00:03:35.170> thing<00:03:35.530> so

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170 
the to the lope and do the same thing so

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:40.680 
the to the lope and do the same thing so
we<00:03:38.170> pick<00:03:38.410> up<00:03:38.560> the<00:03:38.770> outside<00:03:39.250> rein<00:03:39.550> we<00:03:40.420> have<00:03:40.540> the

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:40.690 
we pick up the outside rein we have the

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:43.170 
we pick up the outside rein we have the
head<00:03:40.900> to<00:03:41.080> the<00:03:41.200> outside<00:03:41.680> the<00:03:42.580> shoulder<00:03:43.030> the

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:43.180 
head to the outside the shoulder the

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:46.380 
head to the outside the shoulder the
inside<00:03:43.980> so<00:03:44.980> we<00:03:45.130> can<00:03:45.310> move<00:03:45.520> the<00:03:45.700> shoulder<00:03:46.180> in

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:46.390 
inside so we can move the shoulder in

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:51.330 
inside so we can move the shoulder in
and<00:03:47.140> get<00:03:48.010> the<00:03:48.190> horse<00:03:48.430> to<00:03:48.520> be<00:03:48.760> controlled<00:03:50.340> all

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340 
and get the horse to be controlled all

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:53.880 
and get the horse to be controlled all
right<00:03:51.490> if<00:03:51.940> the<00:03:52.240> horse<00:03:52.510> starts<00:03:52.990> to<00:03:53.140> resist<00:03:53.680> at

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:53.890 
right if the horse starts to resist at
