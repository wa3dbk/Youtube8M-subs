dropped in is on top I'm gonna reduce

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.819 
dropped in is on top I'm gonna reduce
the<00:02:05.369> opacity<00:02:05.490> to<00:02:05.939> maybe<00:02:06.180> 50%<00:02:06.990> so<00:02:07.110> I<00:02:07.170> can<00:02:07.380> you

the opacity to maybe 50% so I can you

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:09.290 
the opacity to maybe 50% so I can you
know<00:02:07.950> so<00:02:08.069> it's<00:02:08.220> transparent<00:02:08.700> so<00:02:08.970> I<00:02:09.000> could<00:02:09.149> see

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
know so it's transparent so I could see

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.199 
know so it's transparent so I could see
what<00:02:09.390> I'm<00:02:09.509> doing<00:02:09.780> and<00:02:10.470> I<00:02:10.560> like<00:02:10.739> to<00:02:10.890> scale<00:02:11.250> it<00:02:11.489> so

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
what I'm doing and I like to scale it so

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.640 
what I'm doing and I like to scale it so
that<00:02:12.330> I<00:02:12.390> get<00:02:12.510> the<00:02:12.540> top<00:02:12.870> left

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
that I get the top left

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.309 
that I get the top left
we<00:02:13.709> match<00:02:14.010> the<00:02:14.700> the<00:02:14.730> top-left<00:02:15.329> corner<00:02:15.810> matched

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 
we match the the top-left corner matched

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:19.729 
we match the the top-left corner matched
up<00:02:16.620> and<00:02:16.890> a<00:02:17.159> little<00:02:17.370> bit<00:02:18.200> around<00:02:19.200> the<00:02:19.319> same<00:02:19.500> size

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:19.739 
up and a little bit around the same size

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:22.220 
up and a little bit around the same size
so<00:02:19.950> I'm<00:02:20.069> gonna<00:02:20.189> go<00:02:20.340> to<00:02:20.400> edit<00:02:20.840> transform<00:02:21.840> you

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
know I make sure the layer that we just

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:24.830 
know I make sure the layer that we just
dropped<00:02:23.610> in<00:02:23.730> is<00:02:24.090> highlighted<00:02:24.510> layers

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
dropped in is highlighted layers

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.940 
dropped in is highlighted layers
transform<00:02:25.530> and<00:02:25.819> scale<00:02:26.819> and<00:02:27.470> I'm<00:02:28.470> going<00:02:28.769> to

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
transform and scale and I'm going to

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.369 
transform and scale and I'm going to
scale<00:02:29.519> it<00:02:29.579> down<00:02:29.730> if<00:02:30.359> you<00:02:30.420> hold<00:02:30.659> shift<00:02:30.720> and<00:02:31.260> drag

00:02:31.369 --> 00:02:31.379 
scale it down if you hold shift and drag

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:32.720 
scale it down if you hold shift and drag
a<00:02:31.439> corner<00:02:31.739> it'll<00:02:32.099> stay<00:02:32.310> at<00:02:32.459> the<00:02:32.549> same

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
a corner it'll stay at the same

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.460 
a corner it'll stay at the same
constraints<00:02:33.390> but<00:02:33.989> we<00:02:34.049> are<00:02:34.140> the<00:02:34.319> same

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
constraints but we are the same

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.440 
constraints but we are the same
proportions<00:02:34.980> so<00:02:35.159> I'm<00:02:35.549> just<00:02:35.670> gonna<00:02:35.760> drag<00:02:36.060> it<00:02:36.120> so

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
proportions so I'm just gonna drag it so

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:39.649 
proportions so I'm just gonna drag it so
the<00:02:36.629> top<00:02:36.870> right<00:02:37.709> corners<00:02:38.250> or<00:02:39.090> the<00:02:39.239> top<00:02:39.420> left

00:02:39.649 --> 00:02:39.659 
the top right corners or the top left

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:42.050 
the top right corners or the top left
corner<00:02:39.989> of<00:02:40.049> this<00:02:40.200> matches<00:02:40.829> I'm<00:02:41.519> gonna<00:02:41.730> zoom<00:02:41.879> in

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
corner of this matches I'm gonna zoom in

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.080 
corner of this matches I'm gonna zoom in
just<00:02:42.299> so<00:02:42.540> I<00:02:42.569> can<00:02:42.750> see<00:02:43.650> that<00:02:43.859> so<00:02:44.730> there<00:02:44.849> you<00:02:44.970> go

00:02:49.369 --> 00:02:49.379 
and then now I'm gonna transform it

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:51.530 
and then now I'm gonna transform it
again<00:02:49.620> but<00:02:50.040> this<00:02:50.190> time<00:02:50.370> I'm<00:02:50.549> gonna<00:02:50.639> distort<00:02:51.359> it

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
again but this time I'm gonna distort it

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:52.879 
again but this time I'm gonna distort it
and<00:02:51.750> this<00:02:51.840> this<00:02:52.139> is<00:02:52.290> where<00:02:52.440> the<00:02:52.530> magic<00:02:52.680> happens

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:52.889 
and this this is where the magic happens

00:02:52.889 --> 00:02:55.520 
and this this is where the magic happens
I'm<00:02:53.280> gonna<00:02:53.370> click<00:02:53.609> distort<00:02:54.260> edit<00:02:55.260> transform

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
I'm gonna click distort edit transform

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.330 
I'm gonna click distort edit transform
distort<00:02:55.769> and<00:02:56.310> now<00:02:56.849> I<00:02:56.879> can<00:02:57.150> drag<00:02:57.359> each<00:02:57.690> corner

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:58.340 
distort and now I can drag each corner

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:02.660 
distort and now I can drag each corner
to<00:02:59.340> their<00:02:59.489> respective<00:03:00.409> corner<00:03:01.409> of<00:03:01.620> the<00:03:02.069> e-book

cover like that zoom out and it kind of

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:09.490 
cover like that zoom out and it kind of
just<00:03:07.170> skews<00:03:07.620> everything<00:03:08.069> nicely<00:03:08.310> for<00:03:08.760> you
