that's all you need to do if you got

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.030 
that's all you need to do if you got
flooded<00:02:31.210> engine<00:02:31.500> so<00:02:32.500> well<00:02:32.650> I<00:02:32.800> thought<00:02:32.950> you

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
flooded engine so well I thought you

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:34.320 
flooded engine so well I thought you
need<00:02:33.190> to<00:02:33.250> do<00:02:33.340> this<00:02:33.460> take<00:02:33.670> the<00:02:33.820> thing<00:02:34.060> off<00:02:34.180> and

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330 
need to do this take the thing off and

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:38.040 
need to do this take the thing off and
then<00:02:34.450> just<00:02:34.480> do<00:02:34.660> some<00:02:34.840> of<00:02:34.930> that<00:02:36.630> before<00:02:37.630> I<00:02:37.840> think

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:38.050 
then just do some of that before I think

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:41.520 
then just do some of that before I think
again<00:02:39.480> that's<00:02:40.480> doing<00:02:40.780> this<00:02:40.870> you<00:02:41.110> know<00:02:41.140> two<00:02:41.260> or

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 
again that's doing this you know two or

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:52.320 
again that's doing this you know two or
three<00:02:41.650> times<00:02:41.890> just<00:02:42.100> to<00:02:42.310> make<00:02:42.370> sure<00:02:51.060> so<00:02:52.060> that<00:02:52.090> is

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:52.330 
three times just to make sure so that is

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:53.730 
three times just to make sure so that is
the<00:02:52.570> reason<00:02:52.810> why<00:02:52.870> that's<00:02:53.080> a<00:02:53.170> very<00:02:53.410> good<00:02:53.530> thing

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:53.740 
the reason why that's a very good thing

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:55.530 
the reason why that's a very good thing
to<00:02:53.770> use<00:02:53.890> to<00:02:54.130> be<00:02:54.220> destroys<00:02:54.550> because<00:02:54.940> it's<00:02:55.270> a

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
to use to be destroys because it's a

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:57.690 
to use to be destroys because it's a
penetrating<00:02:56.080> oil<00:02:56.620> and<00:02:56.920> wall<00:02:57.070> number<00:02:57.370> one<00:02:57.490> it's

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
penetrating oil and wall number one it's

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:00.660 
penetrating oil and wall number one it's
fairly<00:02:58.360> cheap<00:02:59.350> and<00:02:59.590> though<00:02:59.980> they<00:03:00.160> used<00:03:00.370> to<00:03:00.550> get

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:00.670 
fairly cheap and though they used to get

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:03.120 
fairly cheap and though they used to get
hold<00:03:00.850> of<00:03:01.030> and<00:03:01.840> number<00:03:02.350> two<00:03:02.590> it's<00:03:02.890> also<00:03:02.980> a

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.130 
hold of and number two it's also a

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:05.310 
hold of and number two it's also a
penetrating<00:03:03.820> oil<00:03:03.940> which<00:03:04.780> means<00:03:05.020> that<00:03:05.200> guess

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:05.320 
penetrating oil which means that guess

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:06.960 
penetrating oil which means that guess
underneath<00:03:05.680> all<00:03:05.890> that<00:03:05.920> and<00:03:06.580> the<00:03:06.700> grit<00:03:06.850> and

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:06.970 
underneath all that and the grit and

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:09.150 
underneath all that and the grit and
everything<00:03:07.300> and<00:03:07.650> lift<00:03:08.650> it<00:03:08.890> and<00:03:08.950> you<00:03:09.040> could

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:09.160 
everything and lift it and you could

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:10.320 
everything and lift it and you could
that's<00:03:09.310> why<00:03:09.460> it's<00:03:09.760> very<00:03:09.850> good<00:03:10.030> for<00:03:10.090> removing

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:10.330 
that's why it's very good for removing

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:12.180 
that's why it's very good for removing
loss<00:03:10.720> because<00:03:10.990> it<00:03:11.050> gets<00:03:11.200> underneath<00:03:11.440> it<00:03:11.710> then

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:12.190 
loss because it gets underneath it then

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:15.170 
loss because it gets underneath it then
you<00:03:12.310> can<00:03:12.430> then<00:03:12.550> break<00:03:12.760> it<00:03:12.940> off<00:03:13.980> it's<00:03:14.980> also

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
you can then break it off it's also

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.580 
you can then break it off it's also
another<00:03:16.180> thing<00:03:16.330> one<00:03:16.510> good<00:03:16.780> thing<00:03:16.810> about<00:03:16.959> wt4

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590 
another thing one good thing about wt4

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:19.860 
another thing one good thing about wt4
it's<00:03:17.709> also<00:03:17.860> water<00:03:18.250> resistant<00:03:18.820> as<00:03:19.270> well<00:03:19.510> drive

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:19.870 
it's also water resistant as well drive

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:21.720 
it's also water resistant as well drive
that<00:03:20.080> moisture<00:03:20.590> look<00:03:21.220> it's<00:03:21.370> very<00:03:21.459> very<00:03:21.700> good

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730 
that moisture look it's very very good

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:26.870 
that moisture look it's very very good
particularly<00:03:22.540> inside<00:03:22.810> an<00:03:22.930> engine<00:03:23.820> so<00:03:24.820> that

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
particularly inside an engine so that

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.970 
particularly inside an engine so that
will<00:03:27.880> save<00:03:28.120> you<00:03:28.270> a<00:03:28.300> little<00:03:28.600> bit<00:03:28.720> money<00:03:28.930> if<00:03:29.709> you

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:29.980 
will save you a little bit money if you

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:31.590 
will save you a little bit money if you
rather<00:03:30.459> than<00:03:30.640> buy<00:03:30.790> up<00:03:30.910> off<00:03:31.060> after<00:03:31.390> an<00:03:31.510> oil

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:31.600 
rather than buy up off after an oil

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:33.840 
rather than buy up off after an oil
because<00:03:32.470> the<00:03:32.650> chances<00:03:33.010> are<00:03:33.130> most<00:03:33.280> people<00:03:33.670> have

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:33.850 
because the chances are most people have

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:37.800 
because the chances are most people have
that<00:03:35.489> you<00:03:36.489> know<00:03:36.580> underneath<00:03:36.940> you<00:03:37.120> cupboard<00:03:37.690> or

that you know underneath you cupboard or

that you know underneath you cupboard or
something<00:03:38.110> in<00:03:39.180> at<00:03:40.180> home<00:03:41.070> most<00:03:42.070> people<00:03:42.370> have<00:03:42.519> a

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:42.550 
something in at home most people have a

something in at home most people have a
bit<00:03:42.790> of<00:03:42.880> that<00:03:43.650> that's<00:03:44.650> very<00:03:44.860> very<00:03:44.950> good<00:03:45.070> that's

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.340 
bit of that that's very very good that's

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:47.370 
bit of that that's very very good that's
all<00:03:45.430> you<00:03:45.489> need<00:03:45.640> to<00:03:45.700> do<00:03:45.850> to<00:03:45.970> do<00:03:46.120> that<00:03:46.330> now<00:03:47.230> be

out the leading up the plug at the own
time<00:04:17.620> you<00:04:17.769> would<00:04:17.890> tying<00:04:18.459> it<00:04:18.640> more<00:04:18.850> than<00:04:19.000> that

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:19.269 
time you would tying it more than that
