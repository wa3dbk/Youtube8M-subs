00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:10.610
 General requirements must be defined and 

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:13.010
 document the scope system 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:15.110
 environmental management and determine how 

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:17.630
 they will meet the requirements so 

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:19.610
 The following activities are carried out 1 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:22.189
 establish control processes 

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:25.759
 environmental 2 document the 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:28.519
 procedures 3 implement the processes 

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:31.160
 4 maintain the operation of the system 

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:33.970
 environmental management 5 improve it 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.970
 continually 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.879
 environmental policy before starting the 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.590
 implementation design process 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:42.449
 environmental management system is 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.340
 fundamental that the organization defines 

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:46.829
 internal environmental policy that 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.690
 ensure that everyone is committed to 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.780
 comply with the control procedures 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.780
 environmental 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:56.100
 planning once established in the 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.410
 internal environmental policy 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.510
 organization must design a plan for 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.580
 comply with it and establish 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.110
 properly the processes that will form 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:06.990
 part of the environmental management system 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:09.390
 therefore the following are made 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:12.060
 activities identifying aspects 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.910
 environmental identify requirements 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.880
 determine the criteria of 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:20.120
 define the program performance 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:23.130
 environmental control activities 

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:25.260
 implementation and operation this section 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.760
 aims to provide the necessary tools 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.380
 to be able to carry out the 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:31.020
 instrumentation of the management system 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.000
 environmental define responsible for each 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:36.000
 program activity provide the 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.580
 necessary training to communicate to all 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.800
 the levels the programs document the 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:42.960
 procedures and establish a plan of 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:45.900
 environmental contingency 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:48.180
 and verification the organization must 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:50.580
 have an evaluation system in 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.470
 the progress and results obtained 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:54.479
 from the instrumentation of the system 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.460
 of environmental management in the house of the 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.830
 deviation from the established objectives 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.869
 corrective actions must be taken 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:02.520
 and preventive to keep a good 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:04.200
 operation of the management system 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.140
 environmental 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:09.360
 review by management address 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.849
 must review and follow up on 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.680
 continuous improvement is must begin from 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:16.080
 the first phases of instrumentation 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.780
 of psg and stay along 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.430
 last the top management should review the 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.650
 system of environmental vision 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.750
 organization at planned intervals 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.940
 to ensure that it meets the 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:29.099
 environmental policy and verify that it 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:32.849
 met the objectives and goals of 

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:34.890
 environmental control summarize the system 

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:38.069
 environmental management based on the iso standard 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:40.319
 14000 helps us control or eliminate 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:42.349
 the environmental impact generated by the 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:46.049
 processes or products of an organization 

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:50.430
 the activities to implement them are either 

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:53.150
 do not design document disseminate and improve 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.959
 the processes of environmental control 2 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.579
 establish the commitment of 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:58.829
 compliance with the management system 

00:02:56.579 --> 00:03:01.390
 environmental policy through 

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:04.180
 environmental 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:06.280
 planning identify legislation 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:08.040
 applicable plan of activities and 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:11.250
 performance criteria 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:14.250
 4 implement and maintain in operation 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:17.900
 the environmental management system 5 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:20.989
 evaluate and monitor your performance 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:22.090
 and review of results by the 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:24.010
 address 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:26.170
 makes discover the solutions in 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:27.879
 training and consulting for 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:30.519
 implement environmental management systems 

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:33.099
 iso 14000 and other issues for example 

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:36.269
 quality system human development 

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:36.269
 material development
