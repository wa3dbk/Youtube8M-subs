alright<00:02:45.480> the<00:02:45.810> mac<00:02:46.140> pro<00:02:46.290> is<00:02:46.379> based<00:02:46.650> on<00:02:46.769> a<00:02:46.829> design

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
alright the mac pro is based on a design

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:50.089 
alright the mac pro is based on a design
world<00:02:48.180> on<00:02:48.720> circulations<00:02:49.379> inside<00:02:49.769> the<00:02:49.950> inner

00:02:50.089 --> 00:02:50.099 
world on circulations inside the inner

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:52.520 
world on circulations inside the inner
core<00:02:50.400> so<00:02:51.209> all<00:02:51.540> that<00:02:51.569> is<00:02:51.989> going<00:02:52.110> to<00:02:52.200> keep<00:02:52.349> it

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
core so all that is going to keep it

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:55.640 
core so all that is going to keep it
nice<00:02:53.160> and<00:02:53.220> quiet<00:02:54.209> and<00:02:54.450> no<00:02:54.660> fan<00:02:55.019> noise<00:02:55.200> as<00:02:55.500> you

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
nice and quiet and no fan noise as you

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.069 
nice and quiet and no fan noise as you
can<00:02:55.799> see<00:02:55.980> the<00:02:56.430> mac<00:02:56.640> pro<00:02:56.819> is<00:02:57.030> very<00:02:57.299> upgradeable

00:02:58.069 --> 00:02:58.079 
can see the mac pro is very upgradeable

00:02:58.079 --> 00:02:59.750 
can see the mac pro is very upgradeable
but<00:02:58.349> it's<00:02:58.500> not<00:02:58.680> expandable<00:02:59.220> and<00:02:59.519> there's<00:02:59.700> a

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
but it's not expandable and there's a

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.360 
but it's not expandable and there's a
big<00:02:59.940> difference<00:03:00.150> between<00:03:00.420> um<00:03:01.250> expandable<00:03:02.250> and

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
big difference between um expandable and

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:03.590 
big difference between um expandable and
upgradable<00:03:02.910> but<00:03:03.060> as<00:03:03.120> you<00:03:03.180> can<00:03:03.269> see<00:03:03.389> we<00:03:03.510> can

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:03.600 
upgradable but as you can see we can

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.420 
upgradable but as you can see we can
upgrade<00:03:03.780> the<00:03:04.079> ram<00:03:04.260> the<00:03:04.500> hard<00:03:04.530> drive<00:03:04.980> i<00:03:05.250> think

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
upgrade the ram the hard drive i think

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:08.180 
upgrade the ram the hard drive i think
even<00:03:05.519> the<00:03:05.700> processor<00:03:06.120> can<00:03:06.239> be<00:03:06.389> upgraded<00:03:07.190> as

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
even the processor can be upgraded as

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:09.740 
even the processor can be upgraded as
you<00:03:08.370> can<00:03:08.459> see<00:03:08.609> we<00:03:08.730> have<00:03:08.760> our<00:03:08.880> vents<00:03:09.299> on<00:03:09.450> the<00:03:09.480> top
