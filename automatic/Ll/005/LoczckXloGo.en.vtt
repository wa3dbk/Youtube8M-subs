00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:15.410
Whatoplay presents the Top 10 Fighting Games
on the Xbox 360.

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:19.210
This video game ranking is based on a 1 to
10 scoring system called playscore.

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:25.790
It aggregates, averages, and combines all
the ratings given by trusted critics and gamers.

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:29.010
Opening at number 10 is Tekken Tag Tournament
2

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.050
It.. is.. back!

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.840
Tekken Tag 2 is by far the most intricate
fighting game I�ve ever played, where you

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:36.840
can dish-out:

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.260
Infinite amount of combos, air-juggles.

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.329
And those annoying one-two pokes!

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.460
And its all thanks to the revolutionized Tag
Assault System.

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:50.659
Also, if you�re looking for more character
customizations, then look no further.

00:00:50.659 --> 00:00:53.559
It receives a playscore of 8.3

00:00:53.559 --> 00:01:00.499
9th place is WWE 2K14

00:01:00.499 --> 00:01:05.430
Relieve the most historic matches and make
yourself the best wrestler alive!

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:11.200
Now, moves have more impact to it, and you
could really feel the tension as if you�re

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.070
inside the ring itself - which is awesome.

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:20.280
However, the lack of competent AI, and bad
commentators still pushes some players away.

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.570
It holds a playscore of 8.4

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:28.170
Rank 8 is Mortal Kombat

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:33.310
This game is probably the �Best fighting
game revamp of all time�.

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:36.600
With undeniably better graphics compared to
its predecessor

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.950
a revamped control system
More content, like added minigames and challenges

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:46.920
And even nastier, more brutal, and gore-filled
finishing moves!

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.170
Just like how you want it to be!

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.690
And the soundtrack?

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:52.810
Oh man.. classic!

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:54.650
A playscore of 8.4

00:01:54.650 --> 00:02:00.170
At number 7 is Dead or Alive 5

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:05.380
Dead or alive�s biggest pulling factor for
me is its rock, paper, scissor mechanics,

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:08.500
where everything can be countered by another
move.

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.680
The game prides itself by having:
one of the most balanced fighting mechanics

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:12.680
in video games.

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.760
a good solid story
and the hottest-looking fighting girls.

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:21.190
DOA 5 receives a playscore of 8.5

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:26.530
6th place is BlazBlue: Calamity Trigger

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:29.720
A game for those who likes intense action
right off the bat.

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.250
I myself find it a little too nerve-wracking.

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.970
However, that is what makes this game shine
above others.

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.610
it has colorful, animated characters.

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.730
surprisingly deep gameplay.

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:44.260
And plenty of offline content and excellent
online play.

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:49.330
Well, it might not please every fighting gamer
but its fan-base is pretty damn strong.

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:52.080
It holds a playscore of 8.5

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:57.740
Number 5 is Street Fighter IV

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:01.200
Here comes the most-played fighting game of
all-time.

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:06.650
Not only does it have the most loved characters,
but it also boasts the largest fan-base!

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:09.930
With a good story mode
very competitive online play

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:11.900
and plenty of replay value.

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:16.060
This game only suffers from lag and crowded
connections due to having too many gamers

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:17.060
online.

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:20.220
SF4 has a playscore of 8.5

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:26.290
Ranked 4 is Injustice: Gods Among Us

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:28.000
Superman gone bad?

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.530
Playing god and determining who lives and
dies?

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:33.030
Now that�s one interesting story!

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:37.870
Injustice�s gameplay is brutal and exciting,
and one that has been perfected by its Mortal

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:41.110
Kombat predecessor - minus some blood and
gore.

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:46.569
Plus, side missions and awesome costumes for
superheroes gives the game a very high replay

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:47.569
value!

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:49.410
It holds a playscore of 8.6

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:53.480
3rd is Tekken 6

00:03:53.480 --> 00:04:00.209
The 6th installment on what most gamers consider
as the best fighting game ever.

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:05.880
Boasting a slew of perfected characters since
its first game, Tekken 6�s combat is fluid,

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:10.180
and probably has the best-looking juggles
among fighting games as of date.

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:15.040
Plus, by using the enhanced ground and wall
bounce, increasing your combo-count have never

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:16.780
been this flashy!

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:22.569
Tekken 6 has a playscore of 8.6

00:04:22.569 --> 00:04:25.570
Second best is Super Street Fighter IV

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:30.570
Some say this is the best version of SF4,
but for others the worst.

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:36.070
Well everyone is entitled to his/her own opinion,
but as for me, it is - the best.

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:40.880
with added 10 new playable characters!
new second ultra combo per character

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:43.940
and revamped/rebalanced characters to boot!

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:48.620
This for me, brought SF4 from the limelight
to Super limelight.

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:53.630
A playscore of 8.7

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:54.630
And the best is..

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:57.449
Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 3

00:04:57.449 --> 00:05:03.340
a game that has a very solid standpoint due
to its hugely popular anime roots, and probably

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:09.780
the best fighting game there is in utilizing
its arena by using its perfected 8-way movement.

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:14.020
Also because of this, the usual sidescroll
mentality of fighting games are now becoming

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:15.020
complex.

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:18.720
Where you can choose long-range and melee
fighting options in-game.

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:22.130
counter - counters
And experience exclusive content in story

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:24.910
mode not even available in the anime!

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:26.300
How awesome is that?

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:29.490
It holds a playscore of 9.2

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:42.440
To recap here are the Top 10 Fighting Games
on the Xbox 360

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:46.220
By the way guys...This ranking is not our
personal opinion.

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:50.940
It comes from aggregated scores of critic
and gamer reviews.

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:54.010
