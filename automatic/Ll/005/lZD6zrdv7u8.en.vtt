the<00:01:27.930> way<00:01:28.020> in<00:01:28.080> the<00:01:28.229> back<00:01:28.350> I<00:01:28.560> mean<00:01:28.710> I<00:01:28.740> look<00:01:28.890> at<00:01:28.950> the

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:29.010 
the way in the back I mean I look at the

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:30.679 
the way in the back I mean I look at the
totem<00:01:29.310> and<00:01:29.460> usually<00:01:29.790> at<00:01:29.880> this<00:01:30.000> point<00:01:30.119> it<00:01:30.510> would

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
totem and usually at this point it would

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.929 
totem and usually at this point it would
start<00:01:31.049> either<00:01:31.320> no<00:01:31.830> heating<00:01:32.159> up<00:01:32.369> and<00:01:32.580> about<00:01:32.760> to

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
start either no heating up and about to

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.120 
start either no heating up and about to
detonate<00:01:33.119> and<00:01:33.540> now<00:01:34.049> it<00:01:34.200> doesn't<00:01:34.500> affect<00:01:34.950> it<00:01:35.070> at

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
detonate and now it doesn't affect it at

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.520 
detonate and now it doesn't affect it at

up<00:01:55.290> look<00:01:55.590> at<00:01:55.680> that<00:01:55.799> they'll<00:01:56.070> grow<00:01:56.220> spawned<00:01:56.549> as

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
up look at that they'll grow spawned as

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:58.609 
up look at that they'll grow spawned as
long<00:01:57.509> as<00:01:57.570> I<00:01:57.720> keep<00:01:57.900> hitting<00:01:58.049> him<00:01:58.200> in<00:01:58.290> the<00:01:58.409> head

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.140 
long as I keep hitting him in the head
it's<00:01:59.130> going<00:01:59.250> to<00:01:59.280> keep<00:01:59.430> him<00:01:59.579> flinching<00:02:00.000> and

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:00.150 
it's going to keep him flinching and

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:02.149 
it's going to keep him flinching and
that<00:02:00.479> will<00:02:00.570> prevent<00:02:00.780> him<00:02:00.960> from<00:02:01.020> damage<00:02:01.439> me<00:02:01.590> but

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159
