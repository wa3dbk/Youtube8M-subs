to go keyboard this is a new keyboard
that<00:00:16.420> came<00:00:16.630> out<00:00:16.900> and<00:00:17.340> it's<00:00:18.340> really<00:00:18.670> kind<00:00:19.000> of

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:19.060 
that came out and it's really kind of

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:22.010 
that came out and it's really kind of
interesting<00:00:19.540> it<00:00:19.690> reminds<00:00:20.080> me<00:00:20.320> a<00:00:20.440> lot<00:00:20.980> of<00:00:21.280> a

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
interesting it reminds me a lot of a

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.320 
interesting it reminds me a lot of a
merger<00:00:23.020> between<00:00:23.050> the<00:00:23.500> type<00:00:24.190> and<00:00:24.550> touch

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:25.330 
merger between the type and touch

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:29.280 
merger between the type and touch
keyboard<00:00:26.080> for<00:00:26.650> the<00:00:26.710> surface<00:00:27.430> so<00:00:28.270> this<00:00:29.080> works

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:29.290 
keyboard for the surface so this works

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:32.040 
keyboard for the surface so this works
for<00:00:29.470> Android<00:00:29.950> and<00:00:30.310> Windows<00:00:30.960> compatible<00:00:31.960> with

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:32.050 
for Android and Windows compatible with

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:36.239 
for Android and Windows compatible with
both<00:00:32.230> of<00:00:32.439> them<00:00:32.559> and<00:00:33.989> this<00:00:34.989> is<00:00:35.170> it<00:00:35.350> so<00:00:35.589> this<00:00:35.620> is

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:36.249 
both of them and this is it so this is

00:00:36.249 --> 00:00:39.329 
both of them and this is it so this is
designed<00:00:36.670> to<00:00:36.910> be<00:00:37.210> very<00:00:37.929> portable<00:00:38.350> on<00:00:38.829> the<00:00:39.190> go

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:51.100 
keyboard types I feel I could type up

keyboard types I feel I could type up
something<00:01:51.340> quick<00:01:51.969> instances<00:01:52.689> but<00:01:53.500> typing<00:01:54.159> for

00:01:54.569 --> 00:01:54.579 
something quick instances but typing for

00:01:54.579 --> 00:01:56.580 
something quick instances but typing for
a<00:01:54.609> long<00:01:54.850> period<00:01:55.210> of<00:01:55.240> time<00:01:55.420> might<00:01:56.140> be<00:01:56.170> more

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:56.590 
a long period of time might be more

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:58.679 
a long period of time might be more
annoying<00:01:56.829> so<00:01:57.789> far<00:01:57.969> this<00:01:58.090> keyboard<00:01:58.270> is<00:01:58.450> pretty

00:01:58.679 --> 00:01:58.689 
annoying so far this keyboard is pretty

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:00.330

good<00:01:58.899> although<00:01:59.170> I<00:01:59.350> just<00:01:59.740> don't<00:01:59.920> feel<00:02:00.130> as

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:00.340 
good although I just don't feel as

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:02.190 
good although I just don't feel as
comfortable<00:02:00.670> as<00:02:01.119> I<00:02:01.299> usually<00:02:01.570> would<00:02:01.749> with<00:02:02.170> a

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:02.200 
comfortable as I usually would with a

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.800

00:02:13.259 --> 00:02:13.269

I find myself typing on it much quicker
as<00:02:24.150> I<00:02:24.510> much<00:02:25.049> quicker<00:02:25.260> than<00:02:25.379> I<00:02:25.560> was<00:02:25.709> earlier

okay<00:02:28.140> so<00:02:28.950> this<00:02:29.849> would<00:02:30.090> be<00:02:30.360> best<00:02:30.959> compared<00:02:31.379> to

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
okay so this would be best compared to

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.300 
okay so this would be best compared to
the<00:02:31.620> surface<00:02:31.829> keyboard<00:02:32.459> right<00:02:32.670> now<00:02:33.569> this<00:02:33.930> is

the surface keyboard right now this is
so<00:02:35.310> much<00:02:35.640> better<00:02:35.970> than<00:02:36.659> the<00:02:36.959> touch<00:02:37.170> keyboard

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470

so much better than the touch keyboard
even<00:02:38.159> though<00:02:38.459> it's<00:02:38.670> similar<00:02:39.299> to<00:02:39.540> it<00:02:39.769> it's

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:40.769 
even though it's similar to it it's

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:42.589 
even though it's similar to it it's
compact<00:02:41.310> and<00:02:41.489> can<00:02:41.700> work<00:02:41.879> with<00:02:42.060> virtually<00:02:42.450> any

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:39.500 
keyboard for that and this does very

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:41.920 
keyboard for that and this does very
well<00:05:39.830> to<00:05:40.250> it<00:05:40.280> now<00:05:41.180> how<00:05:41.330> does<00:05:41.389> it<00:05:41.479> compare<00:05:41.720> to

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:41.930 
well to it now how does it compare to

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:43.719 
well to it now how does it compare to
other<00:05:42.199> keyboards<00:05:42.740> such<00:05:42.889> as<00:05:43.039> the<00:05:43.159> surface<00:05:43.400> one

00:05:43.719 --> 00:05:43.729 
other keyboards such as the surface one

00:05:43.729 --> 00:05:45.939 
other keyboards such as the surface one
well<00:05:44.240> it's<00:05:44.449> a<00:05:44.510> little<00:05:44.720> bit<00:05:44.870> more<00:05:44.990> compact<00:05:45.590> than

00:05:45.939 --> 00:05:45.949 
well it's a little bit more compact than

00:05:45.949 --> 00:05:50.080 
well it's a little bit more compact than
the<00:05:46.010> surface<00:05:47.020> keyboard<00:05:48.020> however<00:05:48.710> it's<00:05:49.280> much

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:50.090 
the surface keyboard however it's much

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:52.149 
the surface keyboard however it's much
much<00:05:50.330> better<00:05:50.539> than<00:05:50.690> the<00:05:50.900> touch<00:05:51.229> keyboard

00:05:52.149 --> 00:05:52.159 
much better than the touch keyboard

00:05:52.159 --> 00:05:55.450 
much better than the touch keyboard
which<00:05:53.060> is<00:05:53.300> around<00:05:54.289> the<00:05:54.470> same<00:05:54.500> price<00:05:54.949> point<00:05:55.340> so

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:55.460 
which is around the same price point so

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:57.640 
which is around the same price point so
for<00:05:55.580> that<00:05:55.669> it's<00:05:56.000> much<00:05:56.210> better<00:05:56.419> however<00:05:57.380> the

00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:57.650 
for that it's much better however the

00:05:57.650 --> 00:05:59.560 
for that it's much better however the
type<00:05:57.979> keyboard<00:05:58.430> on<00:05:58.520> the<00:05:58.580> surface<00:05:59.030> I<00:05:59.180> would<00:05:59.270> say

00:05:59.560 --> 00:05:59.570 
type keyboard on the surface I would say

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:01.000 
type keyboard on the surface I would say
might<00:05:59.930> give<00:06:00.080> us<00:06:00.199> a<00:06:00.320> little<00:06:00.500> bit<00:06:00.650> of<00:06:00.740> run<00:06:00.860> for

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:01.010 
might give us a little bit of run for

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:02.469 
might give us a little bit of run for
its<00:06:01.099> money<00:06:01.130> because<00:06:01.580> it's<00:06:01.760> a<00:06:01.820> slightly<00:06:02.090> bigger

00:06:02.469 --> 00:06:02.479 
its money because it's a slightly bigger

00:06:02.479 --> 00:06:06.430 
its money because it's a slightly bigger
