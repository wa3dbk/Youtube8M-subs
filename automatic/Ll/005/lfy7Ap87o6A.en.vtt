00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.320
 after the duel 

00:00:22.079 --> 00:00:25.079

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.170
 informed 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:56.820
 already on Tuesday a series 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.200
 little complicated 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:00.700
 i more 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:03.030

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.640
 namco 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.680
 something more than a week 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.690
 I am very involved in the middle 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:13.740
 he worked with the scioli series said luis bolivar almost all 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.740
 what I do is quite a videogame 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:21.500
 for a long time 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:22.750
 from the first 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:26.190
 of the first forests and that we set up a company setasa from us 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:29.730
 and if finally of that activity 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:33.520
 for the conquest of the world as the wise recounted 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:36.520
 they were present 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:39.850
 the glove and if this series things but what is said 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:42.850
 of the saucers 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.320
 if the current season 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:08.950
 quillota 

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:33.449
 or not impenetrable this question 

00:02:37.919 --> 00:02:40.479
 what 

00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:43.479
 queen myself sector 

00:02:46.889 --> 00:02:48.159
 growing 

00:02:48.159 --> 00:02:51.159
 I liked the team so much icbc career 

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:56.329
 It is not good that when armed men in Spain 

00:02:56.329 --> 00:02:59.329
 the politics say community life ppc 

00:03:05.139 --> 00:03:08.689
 if you do not do it the question that arises is whether those standards 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:11.489
 and nothing the answer is the same 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:14.489
 we are hopeful at least one question our 

00:03:15.169 --> 00:03:19.389
 in which who has the rights of this distributor casares multimedia 

00:03:19.389 --> 00:03:20.669
 sacyr and one of them 

00:03:20.669 --> 00:03:23.669
 the Bengalis to want you encouragement is not it 

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:29.009
 the televisions for being realistic to which it is possible 

00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:31.039
 those that you have invested 

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:33.459
 they do not want descent 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:36.459
 they think you do not give them 

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:40.579
 sharp will have to look for another type of formulas 

00:03:44.039 --> 00:03:46.969
 this afternoon he will be 

00:03:46.969 --> 00:03:49.969
 pay salary weights 

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:55.679
 in a multimedia room if the multimedia 

00:03:55.679 --> 00:03:57.119
 despite this 

00:03:57.119 --> 00:04:00.119
 that which is a species to conciliate 

00:04:00.729 --> 00:04:03.729
 and there it will be 

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:09.919
 let's see why 

00:04:09.919 --> 00:04:12.919
 interest that we have for the series because we really like not 

00:04:13.649 --> 00:04:16.590
 to try to support the matter a bit 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:19.590
 weaknesses of the wampis series itself 

00:04:20.499 --> 00:04:23.499
 that's what they say is not happy in the posters 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:28.490
 a special board estimated cobos is a continuation official blog is called the 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:29.949
 eta cupola 

00:04:29.949 --> 00:04:30.939
 is a 

00:04:30.939 --> 00:04:33.979
 it is a hard scum of the episodes 

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:35.330
 what have we done 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:38.910
 min in a version of obvious story be it sound fiction 

00:04:40.789 --> 00:04:43.569
 very committed now to relaunch that genre seems to me a subject 

00:04:43.569 --> 00:04:46.150
 but very interesting 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:49.370
 we count a part and you put more and more 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:50.529
 then state 

00:04:50.529 --> 00:04:53.930
 halfway up 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:56.960
 and what I know 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:59.680
 so what have we done this 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:02.919
 in to put order because they go to each other 

00:05:03.969 --> 00:05:06.520
 like to go a little too late 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:10.490
 we know that the custodians taste for four days after what 

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:13.129
 we have done 

00:05:13.129 --> 00:05:15.279
 our voices in a new story 

00:05:15.279 --> 00:05:19.520
 florin with effects with new characters coming out with surprise to egypt 

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:20.860
 interesting kings 

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:24.910
 and good is what we have been able to do we have here we have brought what you see 

00:05:26.599 --> 00:05:29.639
 by both sides and wants to distinguish what we have also put 

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:36.740
 and up to 10 up 

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:40.449
 family to finish because at the same time by the products inside 

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:44.550
 but if I'm going to explain very well in my opinion the main provider 

00:05:49.949 --> 00:05:52.409
 a life without violence 

00:05:52.409 --> 00:05:55.169
 it can be decisive 

00:05:55.169 --> 00:05:58.180
 of a saga that is behind 

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:00.979
 in these appointments 

00:06:00.979 --> 00:06:03.979
 something that since it is a plan to know 

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:09.430
 in which characters or mine appear 

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:10.499
 in amounts 

00:06:10.499 --> 00:06:13.439
 i new characters appear 

00:06:13.439 --> 00:06:16.439
 we have made a small men poster for the expulsions 

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:18.869
 'our mountains do not have 

00:06:18.869 --> 00:06:21.869
 how the matter should be and the whole story is original 

00:06:22.979 --> 00:06:25.020
 Lee has in these 12 episodes 

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:29.790
 They also come with surprises as you want the closing topics of each one of the 

00:06:29.789 --> 00:06:32.499
 episodes raffle 

00:06:32.499 --> 00:06:34.960
 liliana towers ideals nephews of saleh 

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:37.960
 reports from the faith although it is little and makes a character 

00:06:39.809 --> 00:06:41.460
 and then home 

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:43.759
 he has 

00:06:43.759 --> 00:06:46.759
 an interview at the end the energy cost 

00:06:47.669 --> 00:06:49.080
 with the stories italy 

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:52.080
 a booklet so that we do not sign typical style 

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:54.979
 so that's good, that's what that is 

00:06:54.979 --> 00:06:58.740
 and well now we give ourselves a signed secret pact only wish 

00:07:02.199 --> 00:07:04.080
 come back through the web
