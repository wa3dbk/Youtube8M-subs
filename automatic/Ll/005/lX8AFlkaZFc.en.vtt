00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.800
 z gameplay you will see deep 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.930

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.760
 game place is that stored in my pc 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.689
 and then I will bring still ongoing 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.460
 of time 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.140
 ans to the name of this game had been on the 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.109
 Good connection is playing with some 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.750
 Brazilians and the subject of the video of 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.430
 today is pretty crazy so you know it's one thing 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.469
 that I want to share with you and 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.170
 that at the same time I am agonized by 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:40.590
 share because I have first to 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.700
 Shame to read and like I want to know 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.370
 you too 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.710
 if you have some things like that 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.820
 are similar to what happens with 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.770
 my attitudes 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.750
 It is with my habits do not know man not 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.329
 I know how I can stand it no 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.010
 I can name my crazy follies 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.660
 Anyway, I'll share it with you. 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.449
 You have something similar in the 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.859
 end of the video you also comment to 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.000
 I know to know that I'm not 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.460
 alone in the world 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.619
 So I guess the times I have 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.890
 toc is online now 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:15.659
 about what is touch and it's kind of like 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:18.930
 defined as are manias that you have 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:21.509
 so crazy mania I do not know where you are 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.890
 and what kind you can not 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.450
 control knows 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.979
 there are people who have touch for example 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.250
 keep flashing 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:31.470
 but I do not even know if I have toc is 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.439
 connected but I'm afraid that the habits 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.930
 which are very strange in the least 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:40.590
 strange kind I would say maybe 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:43.049
 I do not know superstitions but for example the 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.990
 Like I'm walking around somewhere. 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:49.140
 It's dark when I need to turn on the 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.220
 light of this place for me to go through it and 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.619
 all over my house and now let's go 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.450
 suppose that I'm leaving now in the room 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:57.299
 to get my school backpack 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.979
 college there like I was visible 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:01.530
 even kicking on the sofa for example 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.939
 but you must go to the light before you do 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.840
 anything in the room 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:08.849
 I know there is old even that for example I 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.800
 I'm going to the bathroom there, I have to 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:11.690
 turn on the light in place before going pro 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.990
 bathroom 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:16.550
 in the corridor and then I went into the bathroom and 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:19.580
 coming out of the bathroom and then 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:21.770
 and then I do so at the time the 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:22.820
 goal went out of the way and then 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:25.460
 turn off the bathroom 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:26.540
 thank you, I feel like I have insurance 

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:30.170
 illuminated 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:33.200
 You are the must- do of the other thing too 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:35.780
 It's just, man, I really like stepping on my foot. 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:37.970
 right in some places by 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:39.620
 example a day of college 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:42.080
 I have the craze to get on the right foot. 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:45.650
 In college, I feel like you're going to give me 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:47.480
 Luck this I do not know I do not know if this is a 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:48.890
 most common thing but I do not know if it 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.860
 something said because I'm 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:54.890
 going well in college is and I was also 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:58.160
 going to college and imagine your 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:03:00.790
 not only a college crossing 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:03.400
 integrated and has the pedestrian range 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:06.680
 cross street fagner crossing 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:07.940
 hence the pedestrian strip there beauty and 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.430
 You have to cross in the 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:12.440
 pedestrian has type 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:14.210
 They have the curb with the undercut of the guide 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:17.120
 two of us even have to have your 

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:18.680
 deficiencies and then type instead 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:20.720
 beacon is already closed for the 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.650
 cars instead of crossing the street in 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:25.670
 diagonal 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:28.760
 I do not prefer and straight is so exposed 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:31.310
 turn left on the track prissy 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:34.040
 up another ramp on the other side and 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:36.800
 turn right type in and most 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:38.810
 of the time I do not walk diagonally was 

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:42.080
 connected in flight by the shortcuts or not 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:45.920
 so diagonally I walk and along the way 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:48.140
 so they were left without definition 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:53.510
 Dude, I 'm feeling red. 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:56.390
 Anyway, I was there and he was old. 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:59.780
 for years circulating 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:01.459
 square is that you understand me but it is 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:04.160
 It's also true that I can not even 

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:05.450
 understand something else too that I do 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:09.860
 a challenge in my mind 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:12.860
 like I'm walking like there mano spoken 

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:15.709
 I can not cross the street euros 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:17.690
 I do not know I'll die on type challenge 

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:19.880
 so if I do not do such a thing for 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:22.850
 Example if I do not go to the gym today 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:26.270
 It's going to suck, it's a nothing to see. 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:28.820
 will roll in the test tomorrow will roll yes 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:30.950
 but it's good it's very motivational but you guys 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:32.960
 you have no idea how motivational 

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:34.940
 That's why I'll do it to you if you do not want to do it. 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:38.240
 one thing but your challenge in your mind is 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:40.100
 so clear that for you is so incarnate 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:41.930
 You end up doing something because 

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:42.830
 you think someone will go wrong're 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:46.520
 switched on 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:49.940
 not this here is the worst in the morality of 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:52.700
 team before now I lost this ours. 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:54.470
 glad that I lost this type I'm not 

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:56.630
 remembering everything but anyway 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:58.910
 before when I was going to sleep guy type by 

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:00.560
 example gave midnight I had to go 

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:02.360
 be watching the globe channel on the net 

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:05.360
 will watch the globe channel I think the 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:07.520
 channel is hot 11 is that hd send me 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:12.050
 had to run all the net channels 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:14.750
 including not only HD and back on HD 

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:15.830
 So I can sleep before I switch off the 

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:17.540
 tv I had to do this I had to 

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:18.950
 change all existing 

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:22.130
 sleeping device 

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:26.360
 mano tipo is not only from there it's fuck 

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:28.220
 I feel for the title, I do not speak more expensive. 

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:29.930
 that's what I wanted to share with you 

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:32.630
 I know if there is any mania of this kind 

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:34.700
