after installing a water cooling kit it

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.910 
after installing a water cooling kit it
is<00:01:10.560> noisy<00:01:10.830> it<00:01:11.610> has<00:01:11.820> a<00:01:11.850> big<00:01:12.119> fan<00:01:12.420> on<00:01:12.630> it<00:01:12.780> and<00:01:12.930> you

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
is noisy it has a big fan on it and you

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.800 
is noisy it has a big fan on it and you
have<00:01:14.159> to<00:01:14.340> actually<00:01:14.490> watch<00:01:14.909> the<00:01:15.180> water<00:01:15.360> levels

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810

have to actually watch the water levels
they<00:01:16.020> will<00:01:16.229> evaporate<00:01:16.530> and<00:01:17.070> it's<00:01:17.820> kind<00:01:18.119> of

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
they will evaporate and it's kind of

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.230 
they will evaporate and it's kind of
messy<00:01:18.479> so<00:01:19.290> it<00:01:19.500> just<00:01:19.710> depends<00:01:20.070> on<00:01:20.280> what<00:01:21.060> you
