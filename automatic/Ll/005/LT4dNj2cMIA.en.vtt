this<00:00:45.570> installation<00:00:45.930> is<00:00:46.230> gonna<00:00:46.410> be<00:00:46.530> to<00:00:46.620> take

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
this installation is gonna be to take

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.799 
this installation is gonna be to take
off<00:00:46.980> the<00:00:47.100> stock<00:00:47.309> mirrors<00:00:47.670> 70<00:00:48.420> millimeter

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
off the stock mirrors 70 millimeter

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.690 
off the stock mirrors 70 millimeter
wrench<00:00:49.050> should<00:00:49.260> handle<00:00:49.590> that<00:00:49.649> and<00:00:49.980> that's

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
wrench should handle that and that's

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.729 
wrench should handle that and that's
what<00:00:50.940> our<00:00:51.059> application<00:00:51.420> becomes<00:00:52.320> just<00:00:52.620> a

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
what our application becomes just a

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.590 
what our application becomes just a
little<00:00:52.980> bit<00:00:53.100> different<00:00:53.550> removing<00:00:54.239> your<00:00:54.360> stock

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
little bit different removing your stock

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:03.450 
little bit different removing your stock
mare<00:00:54.809> is<00:00:55.020> really<00:00:55.410> simple

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:03.460 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:05.800 

with<00:01:04.460> the<00:01:04.550> Yamaha<00:01:04.940> differs<00:01:05.330> from<00:01:05.449> some<00:01:05.690> of<00:01:05.750> the

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:05.810 
with the Yamaha differs from some of the

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:08.290 
with the Yamaha differs from some of the
other<00:01:05.990> metrics<00:01:06.500> this<00:01:07.340> side<00:01:07.580> over<00:01:07.730> here<00:01:07.850> is<00:01:08.120> a

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:08.300 
other metrics this side over here is a

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:10.600 
other metrics this side over here is a
reverse<00:01:08.810> thread<00:01:08.840> which<00:01:09.470> is<00:01:09.590> why<00:01:09.740> Yamaha<00:01:10.280> has<00:01:10.580> a

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:10.610 
reverse thread which is why Yamaha has a

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:12.010 
reverse thread which is why Yamaha has a
different<00:01:11.000> metric<00:01:11.150> adapter<00:01:11.690> than<00:01:11.810> the<00:01:11.900> other

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.020 
different metric adapter than the other

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:13.990 
different metric adapter than the other
models<00:01:12.410> if<00:01:12.770> you<00:01:12.950> have<00:01:13.130> a<00:01:13.160> Kuryakin<00:01:13.730> grip

removing the end cap is necessary for
any<00:01:22.580> normal<00:01:22.910> mirror<00:01:23.120> installation<00:01:23.720> you're

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:23.810 
any normal mirror installation you're

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:25.900 
any normal mirror installation you're
gonna<00:01:23.900> take<00:01:24.110> the<00:01:24.260> adapter<00:01:24.530> and<00:01:24.950> go<00:01:25.550> ahead<00:01:25.790> and

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:25.910 
gonna take the adapter and go ahead and

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:28.210 
gonna take the adapter and go ahead and
screw<00:01:26.300> that<00:01:26.540> up<00:01:26.750> into<00:01:26.930> the<00:01:27.110> mirror<00:01:27.290> now<00:01:27.890> as<00:01:28.100> you

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:28.220 
screw that up into the mirror now as you

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:29.350 
screw that up into the mirror now as you
can<00:01:28.340> see<00:01:28.490> there's<00:01:28.700> already<00:01:28.880> some<00:01:29.180> blue

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:29.360

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:31.610 
loctite applied that's gonna be key to

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:33.190 
loctite applied that's gonna be key to
keep<00:01:31.790> this<00:01:31.970> mirror<00:01:32.300> for<00:01:32.510> moving<00:01:32.750> as<00:01:32.960> you<00:01:33.050> ride
