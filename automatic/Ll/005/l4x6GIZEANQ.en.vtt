 feces your pediatrician every day 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:19.180
 diarrhea is certain 

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:22.500
 diarrhea can be caused by them 

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:22.500
 fire back or a crown 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:27.869
 what happens in it 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:27.869
 your baby's digestive system 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:32.890
 the milk that baby has drunk makes way 

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:34.570
 passes a path through the slope down 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:37.060
 through the stomach and eventually comes 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:38.289
 end up in the small intestine 

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:39.969
 there the nutrients 

00:00:38.289 --> 00:00:41.950
 broken down by the body 

00:00:39.969 --> 00:00:43.180
 deployed 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:45.219
 the nutrients that are not used 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:47.579
 continue their way to the 

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:47.579
 large intestine 

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:51.129
 the main function of the fat 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:52.870
 gut is absorbing water from the 

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:55.210
 nutrients and food scraps 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:58.930
 convert into a semi-solid matter 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:01:00.579
 bowel movements at the same time caused colon 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:02.350
 make sure the bowel movements are adequate 

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:04.649
 remains liquid by removing water 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:04.649
 divorce 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:11.190
 if this goes well 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.190
 does your baby have a smooth bowel movement 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:17.100
 when you have baby he is one 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:20.550
 digestive tract infected with 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:22.890
 a virus or a global 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:26.090
 destroyed that virus or microbes 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.090
 microvilli in the small intestine 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:33.330
 this means more water 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.830
 separated accelerated bowel movements and 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:37.229
 We can enzymes the nutrients 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:38.790
 do not break off 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.440
 when the nutrients than the thick 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.780
 reaching the gut are not enough 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:44.490
 digested 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.350
 as a result, too much water enters the 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:52.220
 large intestine and becomes bowel movements 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:52.220
 even more fluid what is the solution 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.340
 It is important to first and foremost it 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.600
 too much lost water now 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.399
 balance 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.640
 so give your baby enough water 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.640
 drink 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:08.090
 even without copied I can do the 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:08.090
 help regulate the seat 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:16.430
 these good bacteria fight from nature 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:18.380
 rides against viruses and microbes and 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.650
 stimulate the growth of microvilli in the 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:20.650
 small intestine 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.520
 this is how the stool speed becomes 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:28.220
 are delayed and normalized 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:29.510
 nutrients broken down is the water 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.550
 mechanism in the colon 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:33.470
 a balance and the stool is not 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:35.959
 longer liquid 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:39.910
 your baby is not feeling better leave 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:39.910
 lie pediatrician for more information
