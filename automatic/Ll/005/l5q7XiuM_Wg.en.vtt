the case does provide additional bulk to
the<00:02:06.340> iPhone<00:02:06.729> because<00:02:07.210> of<00:02:07.360> the<00:02:07.479> additional

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:07.990 
the iPhone because of the additional

the iPhone because of the additional
storage<00:02:08.379> for<00:02:08.440> the<00:02:08.830> two<00:02:09.099> cards<00:02:09.519> that<00:02:09.819> you<00:02:09.940> can

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
storage for the two cards that you can

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.720 
storage for the two cards that you can
take<00:02:10.300> with<00:02:10.450> you<00:02:10.509> to<00:02:10.869> open<00:02:11.739> the<00:02:11.920> storage<00:02:12.310> area

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
take with you to open the storage area

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:14.699 
take with you to open the storage area
you<00:02:13.150> need<00:02:13.300> to<00:02:13.480> push<00:02:13.690> on<00:02:13.870> the<00:02:13.989> pack<00:02:14.170> with<00:02:14.530> your

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709 
you need to push on the pack with your

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:16.710 
you need to push on the pack with your
thumb<00:02:14.920> and<00:02:15.220> slide<00:02:15.550> it<00:02:15.819> to<00:02:15.849> the<00:02:16.000> side<00:02:16.120> at<00:02:16.599> the

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
thumb and slide it to the side at the

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.860 
thumb and slide it to the side at the
same<00:02:16.900> time<00:02:17.220> it's<00:02:18.220> really<00:02:18.700> tight<00:02:18.940> so<00:02:19.450> that's

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
same time it's really tight so that's

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:21.930 
same time it's really tight so that's
great<00:02:20.230> I<00:02:20.440> guess<00:02:20.709> because<00:02:21.280> that<00:02:21.459> means<00:02:21.640> your

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
great I guess because that means your

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:24.780 
great I guess because that means your
cards<00:02:22.239> are<00:02:22.390> safe<00:02:22.660> inside<00:02:23.069> now<00:02:24.069> let's<00:02:24.430> go<00:02:24.640> ahead

again this is very convenient I really

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:58.199 
again this is very convenient I really
like<00:02:56.500> how<00:02:56.709> they<00:02:56.920> design<00:02:57.340> the<00:02:57.519> wallet<00:02:57.819> part<00:02:58.060> of

00:02:58.199 --> 00:02:58.209 
like how they design the wallet part of

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:00.240 
like how they design the wallet part of
this<00:02:58.360> case<00:02:58.599> so<00:02:59.410> if<00:02:59.680> you're<00:02:59.860> the<00:03:00.010> type<00:03:00.040> who

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250 
this case so if you're the type who

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:02.280 
this case so if you're the type who

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
doesn't really bring a lot of stuff with

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:04.500 
doesn't really bring a lot of stuff with
you<00:03:02.319> you<00:03:03.069> can<00:03:03.280> combine<00:03:03.489> your<00:03:03.700> wallet<00:03:04.209> and<00:03:04.390> your

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:07.690 
iPhone into one with this case so that's

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:09.900
