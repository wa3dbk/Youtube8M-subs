hey<00:00:00.359> guys<00:00:00.539> some<00:00:00.870> developers<00:00:01.319> from<00:00:01.469> XDA<00:00:01.920> have

00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:02.159 
hey guys some developers from XDA have

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:03.710 
hey guys some developers from XDA have
figured<00:00:02.460> out<00:00:02.580> how<00:00:02.790> to<00:00:02.820> access<00:00:03.360> more<00:00:03.570> of<00:00:03.629> the

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:03.720 
figured out how to access more of the

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:05.930 
figured out how to access more of the
display<00:00:04.140> properties<00:00:04.650> on<00:00:04.890> the<00:00:05.040> Nexus<00:00:05.400> 6<00:00:05.670> and

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:05.940 
display properties on the Nexus 6 and

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:07.789 
display properties on the Nexus 6 and
that's<00:00:06.060> fantastic<00:00:06.839> because<00:00:07.020> not<00:00:07.379> everyone

00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:07.799 
that's fantastic because not everyone

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:10.040 
that's fantastic because not everyone
has<00:00:07.830> the<00:00:08.189> same<00:00:08.220> display<00:00:08.849> tastes<00:00:09.540> some<00:00:09.719> people

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
has the same display tastes some people

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.410 
has the same display tastes some people
prefer<00:00:10.170> cooler<00:00:11.130> or<00:00:11.460> warmer<00:00:11.490> displays<00:00:12.150> some

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
prefer cooler or warmer displays some

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.240 
prefer cooler or warmer displays some
people<00:00:12.690> prefer<00:00:12.990> a<00:00:13.019> more<00:00:13.349> saturated<00:00:13.860> display

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
people prefer a more saturated display

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.220 
people prefer a more saturated display
or<00:00:14.370> a<00:00:14.400> less<00:00:14.639> saturated<00:00:15.089> display<00:00:15.480> so<00:00:16.020> we<00:00:16.049> now

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
or a less saturated display so we now

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:17.900 
or a less saturated display so we now
have<00:00:16.470> the<00:00:16.560> tools<00:00:16.830> to<00:00:16.949> actually<00:00:17.130> adjust<00:00:17.699> that

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
have the tools to actually adjust that

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.269 
have the tools to actually adjust that
now<00:00:18.570> it's<00:00:18.720> not<00:00:18.810> just<00:00:18.960> on<00:00:19.320> the<00:00:19.410> Nexus<00:00:19.770> 6<00:00:20.039> it

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
well in terms of the application it's

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.880 
well in terms of the application it's
called<00:00:44.879> KCAL<00:00:45.539> color<00:00:45.930> control<00:00:46.410> you<00:00:46.530> can<00:00:46.649> see<00:00:46.800> it

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
called KCAL color control you can see it

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.440 
called KCAL color control you can see it
right<00:00:47.070> there<00:00:47.340> it's<00:00:47.489> not<00:00:47.640> on<00:00:47.789> the<00:00:47.910> Play<00:00:48.120> Store

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
right there it's not on the Play Store

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:49.970 
right there it's not on the Play Store
so<00:00:48.510> you<00:00:48.750> will<00:00:48.989> have<00:00:49.140> to<00:00:49.260> download<00:00:49.410> this<00:00:49.770> from

it<00:00:54.300> really<00:00:54.449> really<00:00:54.780> is<00:00:54.899> a<00:00:54.930> lot<00:00:55.230> simpler<00:00:55.559> than

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
it really really is a lot simpler than

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.590 
it really really is a lot simpler than
what<00:00:55.890> we<00:00:56.010> had<00:00:56.190> on<00:00:56.219> the<00:00:56.370> Nexus<00:00:56.760> 5<00:00:56.789> if<00:00:57.180> any<00:00:57.329> of<00:00:57.480> you

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
what we had on the Nexus 5 if any of you

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.090 
what we had on the Nexus 5 if any of you
guys<00:00:57.750> remember<00:00:57.960> that<00:00:58.379> right<00:00:58.949> at<00:00:59.070> the

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
guys remember that right at the

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.619 
guys remember that right at the
beginning<00:00:59.489> it<00:00:59.609> was<00:00:59.699> horrible<00:01:00.090> to<00:01:00.239> use<00:01:00.359> it<00:01:00.539> was

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
beginning it was horrible to use it was

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.270 
beginning it was horrible to use it was
just<00:01:00.809> loads<00:01:00.989> of<00:01:01.140> numbers<00:01:01.469> and<00:01:01.680> lists<00:01:02.010> and<00:01:02.190> it

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
just loads of numbers and lists and it

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.830 
just loads of numbers and lists and it
was<00:01:02.370> hard<00:01:02.579> to<00:01:02.640> see<00:01:02.850> what<00:01:02.969> you<00:01:03.090> were<00:01:03.180> doing<00:01:03.210> so

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
was hard to see what you were doing so

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.570 
was hard to see what you were doing so
if<00:01:03.930> we<00:01:04.019> open<00:01:04.290> up<00:01:04.350> here<00:01:04.650> we<00:01:04.799> have<00:01:04.979> four<00:01:05.220> options

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
if we open up here we have four options

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.490 
if we open up here we have four options
at<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:05.760> top<00:01:05.790> set<00:01:06.390> on<00:01:06.510> boot<00:01:06.720> is<00:01:06.930> pretty

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
at the top set on boot is pretty

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.200 
at the top set on boot is pretty
self-explanatory<00:01:07.860> color<00:01:08.640> service<00:01:09.000> you<00:01:09.119> of

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
self-explanatory color service you of

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:10.850 
self-explanatory color service you of
course<00:01:09.450> you<00:01:09.570> will<00:01:09.720> need<00:01:09.869> running<00:01:10.229> invert

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
course you will need running invert

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.770 
course you will need running invert
display<00:01:11.250> basically<00:01:11.820> inverts

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
display basically inverts

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.630 
display basically inverts
all<00:01:12.900> the<00:01:13.080> colors<00:01:13.380> and<00:01:13.619> there<00:01:14.100> you<00:01:14.189> can<00:01:14.340> see<00:01:14.520> it

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
all the colors and there you can see it

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.789 
all the colors and there you can see it
looks<00:01:14.820> pretty<00:01:15.150> funky<00:01:15.810> in<00:01:16.080> this<00:01:16.590> case

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
looks pretty funky in this case

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.280 
looks pretty funky in this case
everything<00:01:17.250> is<00:01:17.520> quite<00:01:17.939> white<00:01:18.210> so<00:01:18.570> being<00:01:19.170> an

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
everything is quite white so being an

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:20.480 
everything is quite white so being an
AMOLED<00:01:19.590> display<00:01:19.860> it's<00:01:19.979> probably<00:01:20.220> not<00:01:20.280> a<00:01:20.369> good

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
AMOLED display it's probably not a good

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.039 
AMOLED display it's probably not a good
idea<00:01:20.610> because<00:01:21.210> it's<00:01:21.390> gonna<00:01:21.540> wear<00:01:21.750> down<00:01:21.900> your

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
idea because it's gonna wear down your

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.270 
idea because it's gonna wear down your
display<00:01:22.409> more<00:01:22.650> and<00:01:22.770> of<00:01:22.830> course<00:01:23.009> it's<00:01:23.159> gonna

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
display more and of course it's gonna

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.399 
display more and of course it's gonna
take<00:01:23.520> more<00:01:23.790> power<00:01:24.090> we'll<00:01:24.990> turn<00:01:25.170> it<00:01:25.320> off

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
take more power we'll turn it off

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.800 
take more power we'll turn it off
grayscale<00:01:26.310> it<00:01:26.490> changes<00:01:26.850> everything<00:01:27.119> to<00:01:27.509> black

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
grayscale it changes everything to black

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.270 
grayscale it changes everything to black
and<00:01:28.020> white<00:01:28.049> as<00:01:28.380> you<00:01:28.530> can<00:01:28.650> see<00:01:28.829> right<00:01:29.040> here<00:01:29.100> that

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
and white as you can see right here that

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.130 
and white as you can see right here that
actually<00:01:29.549> looks<00:01:29.970> kind<00:01:30.270> of<00:01:30.329> cool<00:01:30.509> if<00:01:30.960> we<00:01:30.990> go

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
actually looks kind of cool if we go

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.300 
actually looks kind of cool if we go
into<00:01:31.259> an<00:01:31.380> application<00:01:31.619> you<00:01:31.920> can<00:01:32.040> see<00:01:32.189> it's

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
into an application you can see it's

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.160 
into an application you can see it's
also<00:01:32.460> all<00:01:32.880> different<00:01:33.299> shades<00:01:33.570> of<00:01:33.810> grey<00:01:34.140> and

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
also all different shades of grey and

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.160 
also all different shades of grey and
white<00:01:34.920> and<00:01:35.189> all<00:01:35.460> that<00:01:35.670> sort<00:01:35.850> of<00:01:35.880> stuff<00:01:36.170> turned

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
white and all that sort of stuff turned

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.450 
white and all that sort of stuff turned
off<00:01:37.520> we<00:01:38.520> then<00:01:38.700> have<00:01:38.970> the<00:01:39.210> RGB<00:01:40.220> modifiers<00:01:41.220> right

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
off we then have the RGB modifiers right

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:42.620 
off we then have the RGB modifiers right
there<00:01:41.610> we<00:01:41.759> could<00:01:41.939> of<00:01:42.030> course<00:01:42.150> change<00:01:42.240> those

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
there we could of course change those

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:43.730 
there we could of course change those
before<00:01:42.960> so<00:01:43.079> I'm<00:01:43.140> not<00:01:43.229> going<00:01:43.350> to<00:01:43.439> talk<00:01:43.560> about

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
before so I'm not going to talk about

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.830 
before so I'm not going to talk about
those<00:01:43.890> too<00:01:44.159> much<00:01:44.340> but<00:01:45.000> they<00:01:45.180> are<00:01:45.329> important

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
those too much but they are important

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.590 
those too much but they are important
and<00:01:46.040> then<00:01:47.040> we<00:01:47.070> have<00:01:47.399> the<00:01:47.579> new<00:01:47.759> options<00:01:48.149> right

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
and then we have the new options right

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.929 
and then we have the new options right
here<00:01:48.630> and<00:01:49.200> most<00:01:49.439> notably<00:01:49.729> saturation<00:01:50.729> and

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
here and most notably saturation and

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.480 
here and most notably saturation and
contrast<00:01:51.180> you<00:01:51.659> can<00:01:51.689> also<00:01:51.930> see<00:01:52.200> a<00:01:52.229> picture<00:01:52.560> of<00:01:52.829> a

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
contrast you can also see a picture of a

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.069 
contrast you can also see a picture of a
parrot<00:01:53.790> here<00:01:53.909> so<00:01:54.030> you<00:01:54.119> can<00:01:54.240> see<00:01:54.390> exactly<00:01:54.540> what

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
parrot here so you can see exactly what

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:56.389 
parrot here so you can see exactly what
you're<00:01:55.229> doing<00:01:55.439> when<00:01:55.710> you<00:01:55.829> move<00:01:56.009> the<00:01:56.159> slider

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
you're doing when you move the slider

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.490 
you're doing when you move the slider
which<00:01:56.729> is<00:01:56.850> a<00:01:56.880> really<00:01:57.360> nice<00:01:57.540> little<00:01:58.200> addition

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
which is a really nice little addition

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.789 
which is a really nice little addition
there<00:01:58.860> so<00:01:59.369> let's<00:01:59.579> try<00:01:59.790> this<00:01:59.850> out<00:02:00.680> what<00:02:01.680> we're

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
there so let's try this out what we're

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.350 
there so let's try this out what we're
gonna<00:02:01.860> do<00:02:02.130> is<00:02:02.430> if<00:02:02.729> you<00:02:02.850> just<00:02:03.000> keep<00:02:03.119> an<00:02:03.270> eye<00:02:03.329> on

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
gonna do is if you just keep an eye on

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.550 
gonna do is if you just keep an eye on
the<00:02:03.659> picture<00:02:04.020> you'll<00:02:04.170> see<00:02:04.200> that<00:02:04.380> when<00:02:04.530> I

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
the picture you'll see that when I

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:05.899 
the picture you'll see that when I
change<00:02:04.860> the<00:02:04.920> saturation<00:02:05.369> if<00:02:05.579> you<00:02:05.670> wanted<00:02:05.820> to

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
change the saturation if you wanted to

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.880 
change the saturation if you wanted to
be<00:02:05.969> more<00:02:06.149> saturated<00:02:06.570> we<00:02:07.049> move<00:02:07.259> the<00:02:07.409> bar<00:02:07.590> up<00:02:07.770> and

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
be more saturated we move the bar up and

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.979 
be more saturated we move the bar up and
you<00:02:07.979> can<00:02:08.129> definitely<00:02:08.280> see<00:02:08.550> the<00:02:08.700> Reds<00:02:09.119> on<00:02:09.420> that

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
you can definitely see the Reds on that

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.140 
you can definitely see the Reds on that
on<00:02:10.229> that<00:02:10.440> bird<00:02:10.679> looking<00:02:11.129> a<00:02:11.160> lot<00:02:11.550> more<00:02:11.790> red<00:02:12.000> than

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
on that bird looking a lot more red than

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.640 
on that bird looking a lot more red than
it<00:02:12.239> was<00:02:12.390> before<00:02:12.540> so<00:02:12.840> you<00:02:12.900> can<00:02:13.020> make<00:02:13.140> it<00:02:13.290> more

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
it was before so you can make it more

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.619 
it was before so you can make it more
trade<00:02:13.860> if<00:02:14.010> you<00:02:14.099> want<00:02:14.310> to<00:02:14.489> if<00:02:15.090> you<00:02:15.269> want<00:02:15.480> to<00:02:15.540> go

00:02:15.619 --> 00:02:15.629 
trade if you want to if you want to go

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:17.210 
trade if you want to if you want to go
the<00:02:15.750> opposite<00:02:16.049> way<00:02:16.290> and<00:02:16.530> maybe<00:02:16.829> you<00:02:17.040> don't

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
the opposite way and maybe you don't

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.009 
the opposite way and maybe you don't
like<00:02:17.430> the<00:02:17.579> saturation<00:02:18.000> of<00:02:18.360> this<00:02:18.629> display<00:02:18.959> you

00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:19.019 
like the saturation of this display you

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:20.630 
like the saturation of this display you
can<00:02:19.170> actually<00:02:19.290> tone<00:02:19.680> it<00:02:19.860> down<00:02:20.040> so<00:02:20.340> you<00:02:20.400> can<00:02:20.519> go

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
can actually tone it down so you can go

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:21.259 
can actually tone it down so you can go
the<00:02:20.760> other<00:02:20.790> way

00:02:21.259 --> 00:02:21.269 
the other way

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:23.119 
the other way
and<00:02:21.629> you<00:02:21.720> can<00:02:21.870> see<00:02:22.019> it's<00:02:22.319> definitely<00:02:22.620> less

00:02:23.119 --> 00:02:23.129 
and you can see it's definitely less

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:24.530 
and you can see it's definitely less
saturated<00:02:23.610> than<00:02:23.819> it<00:02:23.909> was<00:02:24.030> before<00:02:24.180> and<00:02:24.390> if<00:02:24.480> we

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
saturated than it was before and if we

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.149 
saturated than it was before and if we
go<00:02:24.659> back<00:02:24.689> to<00:02:24.930> the<00:02:25.019> home<00:02:25.200> screen<00:02:25.439> I<00:02:25.769> can

00:02:26.149 --> 00:02:26.159 
go back to the home screen I can

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:27.949 
go back to the home screen I can
definitely<00:02:26.730> see<00:02:26.879> that<00:02:26.909> straight<00:02:27.420> away<00:02:27.689> when<00:02:27.900> I

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
definitely see that straight away when I

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:29.420 
definitely see that straight away when I
look<00:02:28.200> at<00:02:28.319> the<00:02:28.409> icons<00:02:28.769> they're<00:02:28.950> not<00:02:29.099> quite<00:02:29.400> as

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
look at the icons they're not quite as

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.940 
look at the icons they're not quite as
punchy<00:02:30.000> not<00:02:30.150> quite<00:02:30.480> as<00:02:30.629> saturated<00:02:31.200> and<00:02:31.379> again

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
punchy not quite as saturated and again

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:33.559 
punchy not quite as saturated and again
that's<00:02:32.159> gonna<00:02:32.250> depend<00:02:32.549> on<00:02:32.909> your<00:02:33.060> preference

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:33.569 
that's gonna depend on your preference

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:35.390 
that's gonna depend on your preference
and<00:02:33.810> what<00:02:33.930> you<00:02:34.049> want<00:02:34.260> to<00:02:34.379> see<00:02:34.590> with<00:02:35.040> from<00:02:35.280> your

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
and what you want to see with from your

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.640 
and what you want to see with from your
display<00:02:35.849> I'm<00:02:36.480> gonna<00:02:36.689> put<00:02:36.840> that<00:02:36.930> back<00:02:37.079> on<00:02:37.109> 40

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
display I'm gonna put that back on 40

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.410 
display I'm gonna put that back on 40
because<00:02:37.890> I<00:02:38.220> kind<00:02:38.549> of<00:02:38.640> had<00:02:38.760> the<00:02:38.909> setup<00:02:39.209> the<00:02:39.329> way

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
because I kind of had the setup the way

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.780 
because I kind of had the setup the way
I<00:02:39.450> liked<00:02:39.720> it<00:02:39.900> value<00:02:40.739> you<00:02:40.829> can<00:02:40.980> see<00:02:41.129> here<00:02:41.370> again

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
I liked it value you can see here again

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.069 
I liked it value you can see here again
you<00:02:42.000> could<00:02:42.150> you<00:02:42.299> can<00:02:42.450> change<00:02:42.689> this<00:02:42.870> quite

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:43.079 
you could you can change this quite

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:44.839 
you could you can change this quite
drastically<00:02:43.590> it<00:02:43.799> gets<00:02:43.980> dark<00:02:44.280> it<00:02:44.489> gets<00:02:44.579> bright

00:02:44.839 --> 00:02:44.849 
drastically it gets dark it gets bright

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:45.979 
drastically it gets dark it gets bright
you<00:02:44.909> can<00:02:45.000> actually<00:02:45.090> blow<00:02:45.420> it<00:02:45.540> all<00:02:45.629> the<00:02:45.750> way<00:02:45.840> out

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989 
you can actually blow it all the way out

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:47.809 
you can actually blow it all the way out
if<00:02:46.139> you<00:02:46.170> want<00:02:46.409> to<00:02:46.470> I'm<00:02:47.190> not<00:02:47.310> sure<00:02:47.370> why<00:02:47.700> you'd

00:02:47.809 --> 00:02:47.819 
if you want to I'm not sure why you'd

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:50.210 
if you want to I'm not sure why you'd
want<00:02:47.970> to<00:02:48.000> do<00:02:48.120> that<00:02:48.269> but<00:02:48.450> again<00:02:48.889> there's<00:02:49.889> a<00:02:49.980> lot

more<00:03:42.750> on<00:03:42.930> the<00:03:42.959> bluish<00:03:43.440> side<00:03:43.709> instead<00:03:44.159> of<00:03:44.250> more

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459

more on the bluish side instead of more
to<00:03:44.639> the<00:03:44.760> yellowish<00:03:45.150> side<00:03:45.389> but<00:03:45.569> again<00:03:45.659> you<00:03:45.989> can

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:46.139 
to the yellowish side but again you can

00:03:46.139 --> 00:03:48.050
