 hi everyone today not 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:06.270
 of intro since it is not a video 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.980
 about video games because for me it's 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.450
 a special day and not only for me 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.340
 since it's my birthday 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.259
 darling who has shared my life since 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.429
 several years and as a base a 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:15.839
 youtube channel is to share this 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.970
 we love and among others I like 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:20.210
 video games music is my darling 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.500
 good even if it is not shared 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:23.820
 so today exceptionally that 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.019
 will be music as you can see 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.470

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.840
 right 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:31.859
 I will interpret the last song 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:34.950
 exeption of the paramore group dedicated to 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.360
 my darling who at the base is like enough 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.910
 difficult for me since it's sung 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.660
 by a girl in addition to the song we go 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.399

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:05.640
 if I 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:05.640
 at 

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:12.000
 1 

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:12.000
 no 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:22.050
 it's us 

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:22.050
 m 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:31.520
 I am 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:34.500
 Oh 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:43.800
 bobigny 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:46.320
 all 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:49.910
 you did not get 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:49.910
 The Benin 

00:05:11.409 --> 00:05:15.399
 well here's the recording is over 

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:17.379
 it was even harder than I thought 

00:05:15.399 --> 00:05:18.729
 since you have to manage the decline with the 

00:05:17.379 --> 00:05:20.159
 microphone with the bass and treble for 

00:05:18.729 --> 00:05:21.999
 avoid saturation 

00:05:20.159 --> 00:05:23.469
 it was horrible I do not even know since 

00:05:21.999 --> 00:05:25.389
 how long have I been and how many 

00:05:23.469 --> 00:05:26.800
 press I did but in any case I 

00:05:25.389 --> 00:05:28.330
 took pleasure in doing it even there if 

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:31.659
 I have a little voice that saturates 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:33.429
 now in any case that's all that 

00:05:31.659 --> 00:05:34.869
 follow on facebook or twitter know that 

00:05:33.429 --> 00:05:37.209
 right now there are days of 

00:05:34.869 --> 00:05:38.679
 shit every day this is maybe the 

00:05:37.209 --> 00:05:40.019
 did I meet my darling and that 

00:05:38.679 --> 00:05:43.509
 so it must balance 

00:05:40.019 --> 00:05:45.429
 but in any case here is this video him 

00:05:43.509 --> 00:05:46.839
 is dedicated so I would like to tell him that 

00:05:45.429 --> 00:05:49.529
 I loved him and I wish him a 

00:05:46.839 --> 00:05:49.529
 happy Birthday
