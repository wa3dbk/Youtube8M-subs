the<00:01:01.739> animal<00:01:02.129> shape<00:01:02.399> slowly<00:01:02.789> begins<00:01:03.480> to<00:01:03.570> change

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.190 

and<00:01:17.429> that's<00:01:18.090> how<00:01:18.299> the<00:01:18.359> joints<00:01:18.810> start<00:01:18.990> to
