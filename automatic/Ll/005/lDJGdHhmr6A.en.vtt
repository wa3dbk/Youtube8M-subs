Prometheus<00:00:04.200> started<00:00:04.620> out<00:00:04.740> so<00:00:05.250> good<00:00:05.520> it<00:00:05.910> was<00:00:06.000> a

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:06.029 
Prometheus started out so good it was a

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:07.730 
Prometheus started out so good it was a
new<00:00:06.240> part<00:00:06.509> of<00:00:06.600> a<00:00:06.629> familiar<00:00:07.020> world<00:00:07.259> it<00:00:07.620> was

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740 
new part of a familiar world it was

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:09.020 
new part of a familiar world it was
asking<00:00:08.010> heavy-hitting<00:00:08.519> questions<00:00:08.849> about

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
asking heavy-hitting questions about

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:10.730 
asking heavy-hitting questions about
life<00:00:09.300> and<00:00:09.480> faith<00:00:09.719> and<00:00:09.750> it<00:00:10.170> felt<00:00:10.380> like<00:00:10.410> a<00:00:10.500> very

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
life and faith and it felt like a very

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.560 
life and faith and it felt like a very
human<00:00:11.070> story<00:00:11.099> but<00:00:11.490> in<00:00:11.580> a<00:00:11.639> sci-fi<00:00:12.000> setting<00:00:12.300> and

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
human story but in a sci-fi setting and

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:13.640 
human story but in a sci-fi setting and
then<00:00:12.660> I<00:00:12.690> remembered<00:00:13.080> it<00:00:13.170> was<00:00:13.230> an<00:00:13.349> alien

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
then I remembered it was an alien

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:14.690 
then I remembered it was an alien
prequel<00:00:13.920> and<00:00:14.040> everything<00:00:14.340> just<00:00:14.460> fell<00:00:14.670> apart

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
prequel and everything just fell apart

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.580 
prequel and everything just fell apart
the<00:00:15.360> big<00:00:15.540> thing<00:00:15.750> is<00:00:15.870> that<00:00:15.990> prequels<00:00:16.320> are<00:00:16.410> very

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
the big thing is that prequels are very

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.170 
the big thing is that prequels are very
hard<00:00:16.830> because<00:00:16.949> creatively<00:00:17.550> you're<00:00:17.670> boxed<00:00:18.029> in

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
hard because creatively you're boxed in

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:19.849 
hard because creatively you're boxed in
audiences<00:00:18.750> going<00:00:19.080> knowing<00:00:19.350> the<00:00:19.529> outcome<00:00:19.619> so

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
audiences going knowing the outcome so

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:21.740 
audiences going knowing the outcome so
there's<00:00:20.130> reduced<00:00:20.490> tension<00:00:21.029> I<00:00:21.180> mean<00:00:21.420> in<00:00:21.539> x-men

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
there's reduced tension I mean in x-men

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.269 
there's reduced tension I mean in x-men
first<00:00:21.990> class<00:00:22.140> you<00:00:22.439> never<00:00:22.740> thought<00:00:23.039> for<00:00:23.070> a

something very cool it's serving as a

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
story or at least that's what I'm

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.069 
story or at least that's what I'm
perceiving<00:00:54.000> it's<00:00:54.180> doing<00:00:54.480> actually<00:00:54.840> kind<00:00:55.020> of

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
perceiving it's doing actually kind of

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
mix my metaphors therefore she's trapped

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:57.920 
mix my metaphors therefore she's trapped
in<00:00:56.879> a<00:00:56.940> box<00:00:57.149> then<00:00:57.329> I<00:00:57.390> have<00:00:57.480> swimming<00:00:57.690> upstream

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
in a box then I have swimming upstream

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.720 
in a box then I have swimming upstream
it<00:00:58.320> would<00:00:58.440> suck<00:00:58.770> if<00:00:58.800> you<00:00:58.949> were<00:00:59.070> a<00:00:59.129> salmon<00:00:59.550> stuck

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
it would suck if you were a salmon stuck

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:00.770 
it would suck if you were a salmon stuck
in<00:00:59.820> a<00:00:59.879> box<00:01:00.030> swimming<00:01:00.359> upstream

in a box swimming upstream

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.000 
in a box swimming upstream
I<00:01:00.870> guess<00:01:01.020> the<00:01:01.140> box<00:01:01.350> would<00:01:01.469> have<00:01:01.590> to<00:01:01.680> be<00:01:01.770> mesh

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
I guess the box would have to be mesh

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.520 
I guess the box would have to be mesh
