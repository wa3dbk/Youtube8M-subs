physiotherapy in the north of England

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.389 
physiotherapy in the north of England
which<00:00:53.760> was<00:00:53.789> a<00:00:54.239> pretty<00:00:54.960> big<00:00:55.050> draw<00:00:55.289> for<00:00:55.320> me<00:00:55.590> being

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
which was a pretty big draw for me being

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.580 
which was a pretty big draw for me being
physical<00:00:56.940> therapy's<00:00:57.329> a<00:00:57.379> real<00:00:58.379> hard

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
physical therapy's a real hard

profession to get into in the first

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.790 
profession to get into in the first
place<00:01:00.000> and<00:01:00.180> obviously<00:01:00.449> upon<00:01:01.140> qualifying<00:01:01.680> it's

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
place and obviously upon qualifying it's

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.740
