00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
skin tone that way you get a nice subtle

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.389 
skin tone that way you get a nice subtle
effect<00:01:42.390> rather<00:01:42.540> than<00:01:42.720> a<00:01:42.750> very<00:01:42.990> drastic<00:01:43.439> crease

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
appear a little smaller go ahead and

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.760 
appear a little smaller go ahead and
take<00:01:53.640> it<00:01:53.670> over<00:01:53.909> the<00:01:54.119> outer<00:01:54.299> third<00:01:54.869> to<00:01:55.380> half<00:01:55.530> of

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
take it over the outer third to half of

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.170 
take it over the outer third to half of
your<00:01:55.920> eye<00:01:55.950> and<00:01:56.430> that<00:01:56.640> way<00:01:56.759> will<00:01:56.969> kind<00:01:57.119> of

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
your eye and that way will kind of

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.359 
your eye and that way will kind of
diminish<00:01:57.540> the<00:01:57.689> size<00:01:57.869> of<00:01:57.990> your<00:01:58.140> lids<00:01:58.409> just<00:01:58.710> in

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
diminish the size of your lids just in

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.429 
diminish the size of your lids just in
case<00:01:59.520> you<00:01:59.640> have<00:01:59.759> very<00:01:59.969> prominent<00:02:00.479> lids<00:02:00.659> next

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
case you have very prominent lids next

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.429 
case you have very prominent lids next
you're<00:02:01.619> going<00:02:01.740> to<00:02:01.799> go<00:02:01.860> ahead<00:02:01.950> and<00:02:02.189> take<00:02:02.430> NYX<00:02:02.939> um

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:03.439 
you're going to go ahead and take NYX um

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:05.899 
you're going to go ahead and take NYX um
black<00:02:04.439> eye<00:02:04.649> liner<00:02:04.740> if<00:02:05.219> you<00:02:05.399> like<00:02:05.579> that<00:02:05.759> one

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
black eye liner if you like that one

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.520 
black eye liner if you like that one
that's<00:02:06.090> my<00:02:06.210> favorite<00:02:06.570> one<00:02:06.689> I'm<00:02:06.990> going<00:02:07.380> to<00:02:07.439> go

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
that's my favorite one I'm going to go

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.160 
that's my favorite one I'm going to go
ahead<00:02:07.590> and<00:02:07.770> create<00:02:07.890> a<00:02:07.979> wedgie<00:02:08.489> line

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
ahead and create a wedgie line

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:10.600 
ahead and create a wedgie line
and<00:02:09.259> basically<00:02:09.710> what<00:02:09.830> I<00:02:09.860> mean<00:02:10.100> by<00:02:10.250> that<00:02:10.280> is<00:02:10.580> to

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
and basically what I mean by that is to

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:12.309 
and basically what I mean by that is to
create<00:02:11.030> a<00:02:11.150> line<00:02:11.450> that's<00:02:11.600> thicker<00:02:11.960> on<00:02:12.200> the

00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:12.319 
create a line that's thicker on the

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:14.260 
create a line that's thicker on the
outside<00:02:12.680> than<00:02:12.830> it<00:02:12.920> is<00:02:12.950> on<00:02:13.220> the<00:02:13.310> inside<00:02:13.490> this

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:14.270 
outside than it is on the inside this

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:16.059 
outside than it is on the inside this
helps<00:02:14.540> to<00:02:14.630> give<00:02:14.750> a<00:02:14.780> cool<00:02:15.110> cat<00:02:15.380> eye<00:02:15.590> shape<00:02:15.620> and

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:16.069 
helps to give a cool cat eye shape and

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:17.559 
helps to give a cool cat eye shape and
lift<00:02:16.280> the<00:02:16.430> outside<00:02:16.580> of<00:02:16.910> your<00:02:17.000> eye<00:02:17.060> just<00:02:17.450> a

00:02:17.559 --> 00:02:17.569 
lift the outside of your eye just a

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:19.360 
lift the outside of your eye just a
little<00:02:17.840> bit<00:02:17.990> and<00:02:18.590> you<00:02:18.650> can<00:02:18.800> see<00:02:18.950> that<00:02:19.069> I'm<00:02:19.190> only

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
little bit and you can see that I'm only

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.449 
little bit and you can see that I'm only
gonna<00:02:19.520> line<00:02:19.850> 2/3<00:02:20.540> of<00:02:20.780> my<00:02:20.870> lid<00:02:21.470> because<00:02:22.040> I<00:02:22.310> like

to make my eyes appear a little bit
bigger<00:02:23.840> to<00:02:24.560> kind<00:02:24.770> of<00:02:24.860> close<00:02:25.010> off<00:02:25.190> your<00:02:25.220> eyes<00:02:25.459> a

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
little bit more you can always line all

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.350 
little bit more you can always line all
the<00:02:27.350> way<00:02:27.380> into<00:02:27.709> the<00:02:27.800> inside<00:02:28.120> now<00:02:29.120> I'm<00:02:29.270> gonna

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 
the way into the inside now I'm gonna

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.900 
the way into the inside now I'm gonna
take<00:02:29.600> my<00:02:29.660> e21<00:02:30.290> smudger<00:02:30.770> brush<00:02:30.890> and<00:02:31.310> blend<00:02:31.790> out

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:31.910 
take my e21 smudger brush and blend out

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:33.760 
take my e21 smudger brush and blend out
that<00:02:31.970> line<00:02:32.330> you<00:02:32.810> can<00:02:32.990> see<00:02:33.140> that<00:02:33.290> it<00:02:33.380> was<00:02:33.500> really

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:33.770 
that line you can see that it was really

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:35.710 
that line you can see that it was really
messy<00:02:34.130> and<00:02:34.280> that<00:02:34.400> was<00:02:34.580> on<00:02:34.700> purpose<00:02:34.940> I<00:02:35.239> like<00:02:35.540> the

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
messy and that was on purpose I like the

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.080 
messy and that was on purpose I like the
really<00:02:35.959> soft<00:02:36.260> look<00:02:36.680> of<00:02:36.860> pencils<00:02:37.340> rather<00:02:37.880> than

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
really soft look of pencils rather than

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:40.059 
really soft look of pencils rather than
the<00:02:38.180> harsh<00:02:38.420> look<00:02:38.600> of<00:02:38.780> gels<00:02:39.020> so<00:02:39.709> I<00:02:39.739> did<00:02:39.920> a<00:02:39.950> kind

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:40.069 
the harsh look of gels so I did a kind

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:41.680 
the harsh look of gels so I did a kind
of<00:02:40.190> a<00:02:40.280> rough<00:02:40.459> line<00:02:40.790> with<00:02:40.970> the<00:02:41.060> pencil<00:02:41.209> and<00:02:41.600> then

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:41.690 
of a rough line with the pencil and then

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:43.810 
of a rough line with the pencil and then
smudged<00:02:42.050> it<00:02:42.260> out<00:02:42.410> with<00:02:42.680> the<00:02:42.890> brush<00:02:43.280> and<00:02:43.610> that

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:43.820 
smudged it out with the brush and that

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:45.729 
smudged it out with the brush and that
way<00:02:43.970> it<00:02:44.239> helps<00:02:44.600> the<00:02:44.750> line<00:02:44.870> to<00:02:45.020> look<00:02:45.110> much<00:02:45.350> more
