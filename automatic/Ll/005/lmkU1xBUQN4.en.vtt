out of the way let's discuss the

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.240 
out of the way let's discuss the
exercise<00:00:43.350> a<00:00:43.379> little<00:00:43.559> bit<00:00:43.770> because<00:00:43.860> we've<00:00:44.070> now

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
exercise a little bit because we've now

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.190 
exercise a little bit because we've now
seen<00:00:44.489> it<00:00:44.640> in<00:00:44.760> a<00:00:44.850> major<00:00:45.090> movie<00:00:45.600> with<00:00:45.750> guy<00:00:45.899> using

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
seen it in a major movie with guy using

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.709 
seen it in a major movie with guy using
a<00:00:46.260> pretty<00:00:46.440> respectable<00:00:46.980> amount<00:00:47.190> of<00:00:47.399> weight

00:00:47.709 --> 00:00:47.719 
a pretty respectable amount of weight

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:50.900 
a pretty respectable amount of weight
and<00:00:48.719> what<00:00:49.320> does<00:00:49.440> this<00:00:49.559> exercise<00:00:49.910> technically

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
and what does this exercise technically

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.660 
and what does this exercise technically
called<00:00:51.210> that<00:00:51.449> he<00:00:51.600> was<00:00:51.809> doing<00:00:52.250> well<00:00:53.250> this<00:00:53.460> is<00:00:53.640> a

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
called that he was doing well this is a

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.150 
called that he was doing well this is a
multiple<00:00:54.300> variant<00:00:54.809> exercise<00:00:55.350> of<00:00:55.620> multiple

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
multiple variant exercise of multiple

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.619 
multiple variant exercise of multiple
variations<00:00:56.460> from<00:00:56.850> a<00:00:57.030> standard<00:00:57.390> exercise

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
variations from a standard exercise

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.619 
variations from a standard exercise
involved<00:00:58.410> so<00:00:58.739> it<00:00:59.640> would<00:00:59.789> technically<00:01:00.329> be

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
involved so it would technically be

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:06.440 
involved so it would technically be
called<00:01:00.899> a<00:01:01.289> hex<00:01:01.890> bar<00:01:02.329> block<00:01:03.329> pool<00:01:05.299> because<00:01:06.299> it's

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
called a hex bar block pool because it's

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.090 
called a hex bar block pool because it's
not<00:01:06.570> a<00:01:06.600> rack<00:01:06.900> pull<00:01:07.140> it's<00:01:07.290> done<00:01:07.470> off<00:01:07.619> of<00:01:07.799> blocks

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
not a rack pull it's done off of blocks

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.039 
not a rack pull it's done off of blocks
which<00:01:08.939> there's<00:01:09.180> reasons<00:01:09.540> we<00:01:09.630> do<00:01:09.750> that<00:01:09.780> with<00:01:10.020> a

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
which there's reasons we do that with a

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:11.810 
which there's reasons we do that with a
barbell<00:01:10.500> those<00:01:10.680> benefits<00:01:11.100> versus<00:01:11.430> doing<00:01:11.700> it

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
barbell those benefits versus doing it

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.250 
barbell those benefits versus doing it
any<00:01:12.030> other<00:01:12.119> way<00:01:12.330> to<00:01:12.510> reduce<00:01:12.840> a<00:01:12.960> range<00:01:13.140> of

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
any other way to reduce a range of

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.080 
any other way to reduce a range of
motion<00:01:13.350> with<00:01:13.740> a<00:01:14.040> hex<00:01:14.400> bar<00:01:14.640> don't<00:01:14.909> actually

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
motion with a hex bar don't actually

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.410 
motion with a hex bar don't actually
exist<00:01:15.659> to<00:01:16.140> the<00:01:16.259> same<00:01:16.470> degree<00:01:17.119> but<00:01:18.119> that<00:01:18.150> is

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
exist to the same degree but that is

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.690 
exist to the same degree but that is
technically<00:01:18.810> what<00:01:19.049> it's<00:01:19.200> called<00:01:19.409> a<00:01:19.680> hex<00:01:20.369> bar

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
technically what it's called a hex bar

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.940 
technically what it's called a hex bar
block<00:01:21.390> pull<00:01:21.689> or<00:01:22.020> a<00:01:22.049> hex<00:01:22.619> bar<00:01:22.920> block<00:01:23.610> deadlift

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:24.950 
block pull or a hex bar block deadlift

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:27.260 
block pull or a hex bar block deadlift
now<00:01:25.950> why<00:01:26.280> some<00:01:26.520> people<00:01:26.640> would<00:01:26.880> call<00:01:27.060> it<00:01:27.119> a

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
now why some people would call it a

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:28.730 
now why some people would call it a
squat<00:01:27.570> deadlift<00:01:28.049> would<00:01:28.170> have<00:01:28.290> to<00:01:28.380> do<00:01:28.530> with<00:01:28.619> the

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
squat deadlift would have to do with the

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.649 
squat deadlift would have to do with the
fact<00:01:28.979> that<00:01:29.070> you're<00:01:29.340> doing<00:01:29.610> a<00:01:29.820> range<00:01:30.090> of<00:01:30.270> motion

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
fact that you're doing a range of motion

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.420 
fact that you're doing a range of motion
on<00:01:30.780> it<00:01:30.930> and<00:01:31.200> a<00:01:31.290> movement<00:01:31.530> that<00:01:31.950> very<00:01:32.189> much

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
on it and a movement that very much

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.280 
on it and a movement that very much
replicates<00:01:33.150> some<00:01:33.479> of<00:01:33.570> the<00:01:33.659> benefits<00:01:34.020> of<00:01:34.140> both

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
replicates some of the benefits of both

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.060 
replicates some of the benefits of both
the<00:01:34.439> squat<00:01:34.820> partial<00:01:35.820> squat<00:01:36.380> and<00:01:37.380> a<00:01:37.740> deadlift

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
the squat partial squat and a deadlift

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.899 
the squat partial squat and a deadlift
now<00:01:38.970> is<00:01:39.600> this<00:01:40.110> a<00:01:40.170> beneficial<00:01:40.799> exercise<00:01:41.100> well

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
now is this a beneficial exercise well

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.399 
now is this a beneficial exercise well
it<00:01:42.000> depends<00:01:42.329> on<00:01:42.390> what<00:01:42.509> your<00:01:42.659> goals<00:01:42.810> are<00:01:43.100> for<00:01:44.100> a

in<00:03:13.099> the<00:03:13.189> field<00:03:13.459> it's<00:03:14.299> an<00:03:14.389> acceptable<00:03:14.810> exercise

00:03:15.309 --> 00:03:15.319 
in the field it's an acceptable exercise

these<00:03:15.469> absolutely<00:03:15.949> could<00:03:16.159> be<00:03:16.250> beneficial<00:03:16.849> but

00:03:17.289 --> 00:03:17.299 
these absolutely could be beneficial but

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:19.179 
these absolutely could be beneficial but
I<00:03:17.540> see<00:03:17.750> no<00:03:17.900> problem<00:03:18.229> with<00:03:18.319> the<00:03:18.409> exercise<00:03:18.859> it's

I see no problem with the exercise it's

00:03:19.189 --> 00:03:21.189 
I see no problem with the exercise it's
not<00:03:19.370> called<00:03:19.609> a<00:03:19.699> squat<00:03:19.909> deadlift<00:03:20.449> again<00:03:21.079> the
