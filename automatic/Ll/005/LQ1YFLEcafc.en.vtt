00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:05.130
 for herne chicken and pig it is clear 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:07.710
 regulated by law how much space 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.420
 The animals get what is allowed with or 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.120
 to be made without numbness 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.460
 This is not exactly the case for cows here 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.740
 clear rules are missing 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.730
 modern attitude has extreme consequences for 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.680
 the animals 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.320
 They become super milk machines 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.980
 cows raised the milk permanently 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.050
 should give 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:29.150
 until you get to the battlefield 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:31.590
 or with good luck on a grape yard 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:32.820
 For years she has hardly ever got up 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.250
 one side stood 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:38.550
 because frieda should not graze but 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:41.399
 only milk gives a lot of milk she was one 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:44.219
 so-called high-performance cow should only 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:45.780
 work only on the graveyard of 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.090
 Karin MÃ¼ck is different 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.969
 She was supposed to be five years old, too 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:53.610
 already had to be slaughtered 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:57.660
 then, the only benefit provided the 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:01:01.559
 she should have done and was 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:04.049
 so far still healthy but just for the 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:07.640
 unprofitable and that was 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:10.619
 actually her death sentence 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:12.570
 not four weeks is frieda old there 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.170
 Become her without stun the horns 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.270
 injured 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.119
 she is constantly becoming pregnant 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.250
 so she just always milk after that 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.810
 Third calf tear their pelvis ribbons 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.240
 on 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:28.110
 the life of a typical high performance 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:31.740
 Cow milk production in the midst of 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:34.350
 hightech 120 animals notes bauer schwarte 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.810
 per day with his milking robot highest 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.720
 effectively held twice give his cows 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.880
 even three times milk detects the plant 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.340
 each cow automatically at a station 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.740
 the neck presses itself a beats the 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.079
 Computer alarm and riot must go 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.369
 float 

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:52.470
 that's the cow number five they need 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:54.000
 we have this now for twelve hours 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.590
 was not milked I would now 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.100
 after drifting that now to the robot 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:02.159
 the cows continue to come for the robot 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.780
 only the numbers took the building sector 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:07.349
 they have not been forward for a long time 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:09.000
 Now we have 22 here too 

00:02:07.349 --> 00:02:10.890
 at the age you can already 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.910
 was not exactly hurting for a long time 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:18.420
 of up yet again correct the 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:20.849
 Stramm Best Cow in stall number 34 to 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:23.340
 She gives 10,000 liters a year 

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:26.130
 permanent top performance with follow 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:28.440
 instead of 20, such cows usually die 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:30.930
 already at the age of five you live one 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:33.510
 simple cost-benefit calculation my 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:36.000
 lower limit is anywhere from 7500 to 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.650
 8000 meters where an animal still 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.329
 can produce milk economically 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:42.180
 under which I would be the animal 

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:44.760
 do not sign off the said and because 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:47.740
 This also for slaughter for 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:51.160
 lower limit 7500 liters 

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:52.260
 50 years ago, a cow gave a maximum 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:54.400
 the half 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:03:00.070
 but then milk became one 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:03:01.480
 yogurt cheese with butter 

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:06.550
 Demand also rose 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:08.620
 performance claim to the cows 50 bags 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:11.100
 This is how the daily performance of a milk looks 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:13.420
 single high-performance cow packaged out 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:15.160
 biologically the fan june likes to fight 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.709
 vividly against the high performance 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:22.810
 were in the dairy business so one 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:24.250
 modern in a plant the same heart 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:26.200
 Circulation must perform like 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:27.670
 a human athlete who is the ironman 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.830
 Triathlon competition in Hawaii 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:31.900
 graduated with the difference that way 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:33.370
 a human athlete struggling for years 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:34.860
 prepared and then a time in 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:37.540
 live when it comes up to this 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:39.910
 Competition completes our modern day 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:41.830
 Milk cows need this performance every 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:44.170
 provide day and comes down to 

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:46.180
 their substance shortened life 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:49.900
 huge and means massive slide 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:51.580
 and you also for the milk cows for the 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:54.220
 there is a dairy industry 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:56.260
 recommendation how to keep cows are however 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:58.630
 no strict legal requirements 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:03.000
 Cows are the only farm animals for the 

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:03.000
 There is no EU animal welfare directive 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:09.550
 who weakens is replaced on one 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:11.620
 auction in cloppenburg there are the 

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:12.600
 best high performance breeds of 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:15.400
 region 

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:18.060
 bauer sparte is looking for replenishment for 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:18.060
 his milking robot 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:23.700
 the 193 for example that is now 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:26.450
 not in order when you look there times 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:29.910
 now very small strokes so they are 

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:31.290
 they are too short and already fine 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:33.600
 if that's a bit of a joke 

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:35.790
 you would be the one would refuse immediately 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:39.000
 the dishes when milking and the discount 

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:40.200
 Attach it is always difficult when I 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.350
 already buy then I will also 

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:46.620
 I have what I wish I leave 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:49.139
 Here rather the modern cow is on 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:52.500
 genetic drafting board designed what 

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:55.320
 does not fit is suitably bred farmer 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:57.270
 Spart is successful she can do the cows 

00:04:55.320 --> 00:05:00.080
 he at the auction for his milk factory 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:00.080
 bid 

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:05.010
 for dairy farmers like black researchers 

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:07.139
 this kieler institute 

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:08.790
 To make the cows even more efficient 

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:11.490
 make experiments 

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:13.139
 Scientist at the living object else 

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:15.660
 you have a hole in your stomach 

00:05:13.139 --> 00:05:18.570
 allegedly painless and cut 

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:20.639
 Now take samples to examine these 

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:22.740
 the ingredients and then can say 

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:25.260
 what impact that might have 

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:27.560
 has on the performance on the milk 

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:29.669
 composition on the demand cover 

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:31.530
 excellent basic food and very 

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:32.900
 good food is needed for 

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:36.270
 a high performance 

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:38.400
 everywhere it's about high performance around that 

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:38.850
 creatures cohen it seems nowhere to 

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:41.400
 go 

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:43.560
 because it fits into the picture somehow that it 

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:45.900
 no concrete legal protection for 

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:48.660
 Milk cows are the German 

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:50.580
 Animal welfare law is soft in diapers 

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:51.210
 this point and offers a lot 

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:53.760
 loopholes 

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:55.610
 there are no binding regulations 

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:58.200
 to which one can rely 

00:05:55.610 --> 00:06:00.960
 such a regulation is one 

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:03.210
 prohibition of the anesthetized entorn one 

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:06.060
 renounce the one-sided breed 

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:08.340
 top performance and also if possible 

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:09.870
 because gear for the cattle which it 

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:11.750
 possible is fully sufficient 

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:13.020
 freedom of movement 

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:14.729
 Federal Minister of Agriculture ilse 

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:16.910
 aigner holds the applicable 

00:06:14.729 --> 00:06:18.410
 animal welfare laws are sufficient 

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:21.050
 the federal states would only have them 

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:23.750
 consistently implement written declarations 

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:25.370
 The Ministry does not give us any 

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:27.260
 Findings that with the existing ones 

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:29.000
 animal welfare requirements at the 

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:32.350
 keeping dairy cows in principle 

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.350
 can not be guaranteed 

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:38.870
 Also bauer Sparte does not want a new one 

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:40.520
 law his cows go well he 

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:43.010
 could even eight weeks in the year 

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:45.410
 a time out on straw this is 

00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:48.050
 our wellness area our wellness 

00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:50.060
 oase I always say that's the place 

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:53.090
 where the cows in the time where they no 

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:54.680
 milk is now in dry phase 

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:56.600
 can recover from the last period 

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:58.580
 and the animals really have those 

00:06:56.600 --> 00:07:00.170
 possibility to run on the stream 

00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:02.120
 spares the joints and the bones 

00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:03.470
 The animals are really transformed 

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:06.350
 Get out of this steel again if you are 

00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:09.140
 then for the new me period again in 

00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:11.000
 to be converted to the other stall 

00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:13.580
 the meadow next door is where the milk cows come from 

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:15.560
 but almost never too elaborate they 

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:19.820
 every time again to the milking robot to 

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:22.370
 high-performance cows drive a life 

00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:24.560
 Alone for the profit of living that almost 

00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:26.510
 always ends up on the battlefield and only 

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:29.260
 very rarely on the pasture of one 

00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:29.260
 gnadenhofes
