00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:08.910
 good to all this video I will do it fast 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.680
 to give three warnings first since 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.510
 I posted my first superman video with 

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:14.670
 I have received several messages 

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:16.500
 both in comments and in others 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.599
 my videos that I blocked all the 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.699
 world that does not share my same way of 

00:00:18.599 --> 00:00:23.039
 think and more over they put me in a 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.990
 forum to show your contempt to me and 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.240
 Well, it would not matter to you if you were not 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.249
 because I have also received a couple of 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.409
 the genres to bother me for the same 

00:00:29.249 --> 00:00:33.690
 but in a rather curious way 

00:00:31.409 --> 00:00:36.329
 example in my video goku versus superman 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.460
 extra round the shrink that I will not say his 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.590
 name one because I do not remember there and 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.510
 two for privacy protection but 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.670
 I had an image of a yellow pony 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.620
 said that where he was stronger than 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.930
 goku and that he would block it if he wanted to 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.789
 say that and other offensive things to the 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.250
 like another who told me to leave me 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.899
 of lies and blocking people and 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.120
 well before they reach you with the 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.980
 rumor and get confused like this pair of 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.379
 the whole ones who have no idea of 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.480
 how things happened I will tell you what 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.670
 what happened I did block three 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.350
 users who supported superman but 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.780
 insulting middle 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.180
 and being fucking fanboys or geeks 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.979
 sons of bitches and others and well even I 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.140
 I might have missed since 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:18.420
 I'm not a saint than ever 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.610
 insults but they got to spanair all 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.770
 the comment bar was annoying to see 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.780
 every day pure comments from the 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.570
 Same subjects throwing shit and a half 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.940
 however one of them took pictures of 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.740
 your comments and uploaded it to that forum 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:33.840
 so much that they fucked with that 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.270
 I visited that forum that I went to throw a 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.159
 look the truth is that I expected a 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.810
 serious discussion forum and I finished 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.000
 finding a forum full of porn 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.220
 dental and just in a small section 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.140
 I could see the post and of course the 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.210
 photos but what caught my attention 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.460
 was that he only uploaded pictures of what he 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.619
 it said and by sections so it seems to me 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.569
 comic that I will take strategic photos 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:56.640
 to their arguments where they were not seen 

00:01:54.569 --> 00:01:58.500
 the insults and did not put the whole list 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.200
 because it was not even half of what 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.479
 that he put daily on me those 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.789
 users the several that they missed the 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.830
 stripe sent them a warning not 

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:10.049
 very strict but if after that 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:11.940
 continue and even worse because neither do I 

00:02:10.049 --> 00:02:13.950
 I was going to let that happen like that 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:16.230
 so I had to take action 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.150
 What also seems strange to me is that 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.280
 many times he tells me some of 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:22.950
 that forum in my videos or my channel put the 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.420
 link of the page look I do not have 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.670
 no interest in publicizing them 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.530
 free to that forum on my channel ni 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:30.180
 videos so if you want to tell me something 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.190
 they can do it by a message 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.530
 staff since I guess this is 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:36.750
 against me or comments 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.940
 as long as you do not spam 10,000 times as 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:41.130
 those three but do not come with that 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.630
 pathetic strategy of walking publishing 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:44.400
 the link of your forum to try 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:46.230
 get propaganda through the 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.209
 controversial so if they put it then 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:50.190
 I will simply keep it because if I 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:51.870
 they think so cowardly because they do not speak 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:54.030
 with me instead of walking creating 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:56.819
 accounts and publish the same link one and 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:58.680
 again as I said it does not bother me that 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:01.170
 discuss even with insults while 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:03.150
 see that they can defend themselves but 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:05.430
 if they go over the line they simply 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:07.170
 a warning will come though 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:09.090
 none so far has filled me the 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:11.519
 comment bar as they did 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:13.380
 those three at the time and it's a lie that 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:15.510
 block people who do not believe what 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:17.730
 that I say since for example I suppose 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:19.860
 that remember trick without the loquera of 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:22.110
 blue pony that appears in some 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:24.270
 and videos as a guest at the beginning and 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:26.370
 I discussed a lot about my video of 

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:28.470
 goku against superman since she has 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:30.510
 his own theories that superman wins 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:32.460
 and even though we were never 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:34.500
 agreement on that topic we end up being 

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:36.270
 friends and even today we 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:38.370
 we consulted our opinion about 

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:40.860
 different themes and also for example 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:43.140
 the statkevich user that also 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:45.210
 he sent personal messages putting his 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:47.250
 own theory that superman wins and 

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:49.530
 we also can not agree on 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:51.450
 that and today we get along a lot 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:53.459
 well and we usually talk on facebook to 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:55.440
 same as other users with whom already 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:58.080
 I do not speak so much I like the debate 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:00.180
 friendly both goku and superman for 

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:02.310
 me are maybe the two most heroes 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:04.530
 recognized the world and the fact that 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:06.570
 I believe that what you earn does not make you think 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:08.550
 that superman is a shit fascinates me 

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:10.140
 see him on adventures I have never never 

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:12.209
 said that goku is invincible 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:14.820
 even the guy from the nou could 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:16.859
 kill him but I do believe that what is 

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:18.900
 the best melee fighter in the 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:21.000
 world of fiction but you also have to 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:23.130
 take into account that the level of anime is 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.410
 limited so I do not know how many thousands of 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:27.270
 millions of characters exist like this 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:29.730
 making this clear let's move on to 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:32.340
 following notices the second notice is 

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:34.230
 that the fight between Dr. Manhattan and 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:36.090
 yonder and the spectrum may take a 

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:38.160
 little more than anticipated since as 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:40.380
 they will know we are already finishing the year and 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:42.690
 things in the university get more 

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:45.000
 hard plus we should all try 

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:46.770
 get out the best standing at the end of the year 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.170
 that it is possible that the next video 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:51.150
 take two or three weeks depending on 

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:53.520
 How many things do I have to do that are 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:55.590
 priorities for me in what is also going 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:57.660
 a good rest and fun for 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:59.610
 get rid of the stress of homework and 

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:01.320
 third many people have asked me 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:03.390
 to put information on 

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:05.250
 soundtracks that I use and I think from 

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:07.410
 now I will do it but as a data 

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:09.810
 extra I'll tell you to mainly use 

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:11.970
 that a game track person 3 of 

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:14.490
 where my saint character comes from 

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:16.650
 seiya or mega where soma comes from 

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:19.020
 helsinn where does dick come from or from 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:21.300
 person 4 where our people come from 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:23.850
 secondary avatars also usually 

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:26.040
 I will use music of final fantasy crisis 

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:28.140
 core and final fantasy dissidia since 

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:30.030
 I 've always been a fan of that saga 

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:31.770
 It would not bother me if they passed me the 

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:33.840
 music data that you 

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:35.970
 leader in great if they have rock would be 

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:38.550
 the best but I also like the 

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:40.800
 epic classic compositions and good 

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:42.629
 would be everything for now it is also possible 

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:45.150
 try to put publicity on my 

00:05:42.629 --> 00:05:47.250
 videos the truth I do not know very well how 

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:49.349
 but if it works, I suppose 

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:51.419
 it will be worth trying until soon 

00:05:49.349 --> 00:05:53.599
 people and I thank you for your support and your 

00:05:51.419 --> 00:05:53.599
 Attention
