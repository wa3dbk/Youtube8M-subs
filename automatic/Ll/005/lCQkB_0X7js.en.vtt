00:00:34.629 --> 00:00:40.160
 today we look at such a cool 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:42.890
 the fight that happened to me at all 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:46.280
 I recently rode on such an interesting 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:47.840
 cars like su-85 and coast to me 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.830
 coast coast when 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:53.809
 stasyan wanted to say i rode on 

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:55.760
 Churchill but churchill understandable imba pro 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:57.589
 we will talk to her too 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:00.500
 recently rolled out but this fight will be 

00:00:57.589 --> 00:01:03.409
 it is on the su-85 and who is not aware of it 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:06.350
 premium level-five machine 

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:08.320
 and see that this map is Lasville and I 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:11.000
 I 'm trying to take this one 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:12.890
 enlightening bush which is all here 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.890
 this move allows us to enlighten with 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:18.409
 horns but as always i'm not lucky and not 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:21.590
 Lucky me precisely in the fact that there generally 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:23.780
 immediately just a bunch of whole enemies here 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:24.680
 I come, I understand that I am honest 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.479
 talking cranks 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:29.960
 Well, what they should now stand up and 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:32.119
 just kill me and more behind b12 b1 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.219
 they don't want to help me at all trying 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:38.780
 pick up all the same t 67 

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:40.939
 he took t49 in the past and look 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:43.189
 that the enemies of something else like 2 I am left 

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:45.039
 I try to scream the station where you are 

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:47.390
 there is enough to go to the city 

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:50.450
 come closer and help me in any way 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:52.759
 for 81 damage here's another enemy 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.320
 flashes and I'm just standing and 

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:57.109
 just trying to highlight 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:59.420
 just for the allies, well, I see that there 

00:01:57.109 --> 00:02:03.259
 somewhere along the shore trees are breaking so what 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:06.170
 already do most of the allies in yes and 

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:08.060
 opponents hang out there in the gorge too 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:10.460
 I understand that I have a mine sooner or later 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.960
 just push and kill whatever fri -shka 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:14.510
 it was not interesting by the way yes he is there 

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:16.760
 their characteristics are quite interesting 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:19.370
 there is no armor but good mobility and 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:21.260
 great gun but this is just a little bit 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:23.840
 I will sip a separate guide later 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:26.200
 enemies are worth they don't react at all 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:27.860
 most of all I liked the enemy t 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.410
 34 which 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:32.240
 it steadfastly stood watching here 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:34.100
 here I will lay out he shoots but 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:36.560
 misses like this a little bit of it 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:37.640
 I breed for the shot we highlight well 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.290
 see that allies 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.240
 but in particular, stas is still me 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:43.220
 help and here is an unpleasant situation 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:46.400
 because what am i talking about yes trees 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:49.070
 broke along the shore to me and there t-34 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.750
 which is generally just thrust first 

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:52.610
 we all and allies no one in the city 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.470
 never reached slaves there 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:55.970
 too, almost all were not visible 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.820
 in the gorge and on the center 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:01.400
 but 3 foursome is such a funny guy but he 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:03.530
 not the only one he has a similar 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:06.290
 friend is also on t 34 which is right here 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:08.209
 not far from the stone but I enlighten 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:11.060
 I can not wait for him a little while 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:13.850
 out of the light and I will try again 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:15.950
 enemy t 3 4 dilute on shot 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:16.959
 so with a little bit protruding nothing 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:20.150
 I do not illuminate 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:22.580
 valentine need i say stasya well come on 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:24.230
 already faster faster because well damn 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:26.630
 stand and here just idle 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:29.600
 highlighting but I am Fri-shka damn that breed 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:32.330
 little t 3 4 but he already this time is not 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:34.340
 even trying to shoot at all 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:37.489
 he is on the drum what is happening and only 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:40.010
 when he has 28 checkpoints, he remains 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:41.989
 it becomes a shot it is activated but 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:43.910
 I do not have time and die here I screwed up 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:45.799
 That there still Oleg that which stood generally 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:48.620
 not glow but he does not cause only 

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:50.840
 some hundred damage still 57 left in 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:52.640
 Well, I continue continuing 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:54.890
 highlight enemies because of the stone but 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:57.830
 there is such a sad 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:04:01.190
 tragic situation kvass kills me with 

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:03.410
 cities and natural stasu screaming come on 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:05.570
 kill this kvass faster 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:07.760
 zadolbalsya then stone shine on me 

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:10.580
 still salted but at least you need 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:13.580
 drag the fight but as always all allies 

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:16.790
 the rest and enemies hang out friends in 

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:20.180
 gorge but we will return to it later 

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:22.280
 Well, we look that after all they finish there 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:24.410
 Enemy bird and becoming already with his 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:27.320
 cannon in two seconds reload just 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:29.030
 is attached to a new one so let's say 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:32.000
 seconds which is a little perry 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:34.790
 balanced him on his gun there 450 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.260
 61 damage and punch well 

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:39.720
 many are already quite dangerous 

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:41.880
 this is not the whole interesting story to 100 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:43.920
 will try to try now somehow 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:47.250
 go and get this ill-fated 

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:49.050
 kvass which brute I got so 

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:52.050
 it was so beautiful 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:53.700
 but unfortunately no luck only 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:56.580
 where did they go to the city and 

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:58.260
 These are 1s and he took me all the same but 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:59.750
 this is also not the last thing to be 

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:02.520
 here it is interesting interesting that I 

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:04.890
 finally go to the gorge 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:07.590
 see what's going on there he 

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:09.180
 says everything is fine 1110 score on 

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:11.970
 principle, everything seems to be allies 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:14.940
 alive and looking already here just a whole 

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:16.980
 barrier from allied and enemy corpses 

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:18.780
 tanks and what happens next here 

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:24.090
 there is not a shootout over there 

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:25.710
 1958 Tolik tries the tower on its b1 

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:27.600
 trying to tank something but tanks 

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:30.360
 naturally low-level dies 

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:32.640
 very quickly 3 foursome well done to him 

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:34.470
 it turns out better to tank the tower but 

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:35.940
 still still living trying for something 

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:38.280
 nastrofirovat kill him remains 

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:40.500
 eleven and he while not dying 

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:41.340
 although it seems to be on it now 

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:44.340
 the towers 

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:46.620
 he is just such a desperate annihilator 

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:48.780
 tanks still nick not for nothing about yourself 

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:51.030
 I took it, but here you still got it 

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:54.410
 look how much has accumulated here 

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:57.000
 corpses it's just some kind but i don't know 

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:59.910
 madness but the point is 

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.770
 hetzer is trying to squeeze but 

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:04.620
 they did not work and pieces 

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:07.200
 quite so hospitable meets 

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:09.150
 near the base of whom first now gets 

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:11.970
 here it remains hetzer who seems to be 

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:15.330
 small but still climb through him 

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:17.880
 fails and do you think that 

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:19.290
 happened u well let where are you 

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:21.390
 a piece come on handsome 

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:23.250
 takes and just come on come on how much 

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:25.920
 you can take time to take and get 

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:27.930
 and here is the most such apogee the most such 

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:30.930
 interesting moment of battle you just 

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:32.730
 look at the number of corpses in the gorge 

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:35.580
 I immediately took a screenshot because but 

00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:41.040
 it's just not only beauty here 

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:45.660
 just one three three 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 tanks 

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:47.230
 below there are two more 12 there are still 2 14 tanks 

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:49.780
 there is a gender team and 

00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:51.820
 in 10 people just lined up 

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:54.220
 but it's just screaming 

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:55.720
 but here is such a small but interesting 

00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:57.640
 in my opinion the fight understood who with 

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:59.980
 basket and bolts to knot to me 

00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:03.220
 it seemed to me all the time 

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:05.800
 interesting near the stone so cool 

00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:08.230
 dedicated at the end here is such a hedge of 

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:11.230
 corpses and by the way this is ally then the pieces 

00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:13.540
 still gone I'll stay thick 

00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:16.930
 stephen yes go here quickly 

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:19.210

00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:21.250
 tanks but he did not have time for his Churchill 

00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:22.720
