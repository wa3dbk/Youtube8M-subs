00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:09.480
 bio hello nice that we again 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.450
 reingeschaut 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.490
 There is nothing new around here 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.820
 exciting today we trade this 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.920
 low beam on the car as broken 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.589
 is so simple is the thing so it looks 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.240
 From both me we notice that the light 

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:26.429
 broke down thanks to the great 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.249
 technology has shown our car that 

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:30.900
 he clearly 

00:00:28.249 --> 00:00:33.030
 if we see the symbol you can do it 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:37.260
 that europe is finally a bee 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.190
 at least broken is about profits 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.990
 We do not need to swap 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:43.740
 special tool we just need 

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:45.900
 our two hands so yes then we go 

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:47.610
 just look out and watch first 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:51.030
 times what plans is broken if the left 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.290
 or right side and for the bonnet 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.110
 in rules was already and then 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:58.810
 Let's have a look outside 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:00.670
 we see the left side is lit up 

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:07.360
 we come to the right side and 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:09.990
 we see nothing lights up everything clearly 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:12.910
 the page is broken 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:15.610
 bonnet and then look us 

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:18.210
 the back of the headlamps and 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:20.710
 then we see in the picture on the left 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.700
 and on the right two we cling to 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:23.700
 have to push aside 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:33.850
 but let's press the brackets 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:37.539
 page and then we can the 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:39.399
 Cover the headlight out communist 

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:42.970
 sometimes a bit chubby go now 

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:46.470
 Immediately I have a bit with one 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:46.470
 hand holding the camera and each other 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:02.860
 so when the lid is out we can 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:05.729
 the plug connection the cables of the 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:09.970
 subtract from other shapes dipped beam 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:11.739
 Sometimes sitting there very tight does not mean 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:24.130
 the whole lamp makes it out right away 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:26.349
 Carefully there is the plug now 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:28.390
 we still have to take out the bene the 

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:32.739
 is secured with such a curved 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:34.150
 Wire Sundecks thing is pretty 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:37.600
 fiddly if you do not see what 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:38.709
 That's why you have to solve that 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.720
 I here times now with the phone into a 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:44.859
 I'll show you the photo now 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:48.700
 there you see this wire the db 

00:02:44.859 --> 00:02:50.290
 ensure this is tackled up 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.700
 pushed back to the side 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:53.440
 pushed and then you can do the after 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:58.630
 fold down and the bulb is free 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:03:00.579
 and you can pull them out fell 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:04.120
 So ironed down and then 

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:05.500
 Can we take out the pear it 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.700
 then goes relatively light it receives from 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:11.350
 quickly suspecting we look on it 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:16.690
 blown 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:19.240
 So a new museum the vitreous of the 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:21.210
 Do not touch the pear with your fingers 

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:25.380
 I should do it 

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:27.400
 We'll touch it at the bottom 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:34.210
 and then we can already do it 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:37.210
 put in a little bit more 

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:38.440
 watch where we can go exactly 

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:39.610
 we look at the whole from outside 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:43.360
 you can look there because of the 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:45.010
 look at the spotlight then look 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:47.650
 you also a bit of what you get from 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:49.300
 them because right now makes camera 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:54.100
 you would think so too 

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:54.880
 see what comes right now 

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:59.650
 bit different 

00:03:54.880 --> 00:04:04.230
 the camera can stop there now you can 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:04.230
 see where the pear is 

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:12.510
 now like to use this watch here 

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:12.510
 sitting properly 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:20.620
 and if she sits properly then yes 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:22.600
 The clip of clip the clip 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:26.290
 no idea how the thing is still hot 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:33.310
 it is precisely locked in place that the bees 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:34.870
 not fall out and the cables of the 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:37.020
 plug can also be plugged on again 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:37.020
 become 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:47.200
 now we look again from the outside 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:49.540
 still looks good then on 

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:51.970
 make as I said the plug yet 

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:54.000
 it we also want to be happy 

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:57.419
 lights up again when they turn on 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.419
 without electricity 

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:11.290
 cover company to lay hand 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:18.400
 Carefully pure them so they too 

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:21.870
 a little formula work still the brackets 

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:28.979
 pushed back to the middle that the 

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:28.979
 cover is solid and good 

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:32.710
 Now we can turn the engine back on 

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:34.479
 turn on the lights throw in 

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:38.620
 again a control look on it lamp 

00:05:34.479 --> 00:05:40.840
 lights up and our work is completed 

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:42.460
 that was it so easy you can get that 

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:44.729
 change dipped beam 

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:47.919
 a bit chubby sometimes but 

00:05:44.729 --> 00:05:51.400
 actually feasible for everyone 

00:05:47.919 --> 00:05:52.690
 no big problem the whole and yes me 

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:54.340
 do not thank me for spectators 

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:55.539
 Has liked it and if I have 

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:57.400
 somehow a little something 

00:05:55.539 --> 00:05:59.319
 has so I'm not super 

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:01.900
 engineer that everything can be repaired 

00:05:59.319 --> 00:06:05.139
 but such small things feel 

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:07.380
 then imagine and your concert 

00:06:05.139 --> 00:06:07.380
 look at 

00:06:08.159 --> 00:06:13.000
 yes that was it first of me and then 

00:06:11.409 --> 00:06:15.120
 I'll say goodbye to the next one 

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.120
 times
