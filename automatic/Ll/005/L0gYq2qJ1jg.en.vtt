00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:10.950
 hello today we do 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:13.049
 and I have one for that 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.900
 You can only do the pattern 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:20.160
 make tips like this or just stop 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:22.380
 I still have the embroiderer 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:30.929
 then I'll show you the wlc needs 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:33.360
 So your white color does not have to be that way 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:37.160
 but may need to cover the medium 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:41.340
 I already take his from you 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:44.930
 your job went to drawing in the page 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:48.149
 Your free nail yourself here me 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:49.680
 and then where you put your front has the top 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:54.149
 or if we have such a long one 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:58.320
 nail has wegmann he sees white whiter 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:01:01.219
 top is and that's what you do so 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.219
 a white line 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.850
 line to 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:38.200
 then you have your french tip like this and 

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:41.560
 then you have that done or 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:44.950
 line wanted to have a great and 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:46.420
 Now you take your nail polish or white 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:50.369
 at another I have two now 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:54.539
 different and then you feel that too 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:54.539
 you just miss it 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:10.580
 that the sharpest one does not have to be 

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:12.230
 Be covering now then it looks like this 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:15.860
 and you leave that a little bit now 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:18.470
 Dry if dried well 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:20.590
 is you taking your colors he for that 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:27.010
 want to take oktoberfest in my 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:32.709
 It is red now we take the red 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:38.799
 do doping with the sign page and 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:38.799
 then you make a line here 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:53.109
 and the more times but a high and surcharges 

00:02:55.599 --> 00:03:01.250
 you can only do what we have here now 

00:02:58.609 --> 00:03:03.290
 make a point that they are his 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:05.900
 could also be quite on the whole situation 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:10.010
 if he does not stop this fat 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:14.079
 you and now we start from the top 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:16.150
 from the second line to the line still 

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:19.700
 to pull down 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:22.129
 he forms a triangle around and 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:24.069
 then here also after the titles 

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:26.840
 stroked far down 

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:29.959
 then this time sets the choice 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:34.609
 the first line where down and father 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:36.049
 Never makes the line up there 

00:03:34.609 --> 00:03:39.349
 stroked to the end 

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:49.669
 so and now here again 

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:52.060
 down again and pull something else 

00:03:49.669 --> 00:03:52.060
 in order to 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:56.459
 now we are a sticker the thick 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:58.890
 I bought from the essens 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:06.650
 oktoberfest DE maybe you get 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:06.650
 which is still somewhere I suppose I am 

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:22.459
 I take my heart and I take that 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:31.919
 namely, peppercorn heart so i have 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:36.630
 me for extra son roses wooden sticks 

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:41.550
 then I can place that better and 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:44.280
 then I just put it on and have 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:47.850
 I almost do that and then I have that 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:53.850
 Hearts there now takes only too good 

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:57.000
 Last your complaint so that thick too 

00:04:53.850 --> 00:05:01.620
 Holding it for a long time simply makes it 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:03.750
 dresses to the bit over it and if 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:05.400
 then the top is still very good 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:08.280
 met and it makes you about it too 

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:12.630
 again your top coat with it too 

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:15.510
 Everything is wonderful when you are on the 

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:20.910
 oktoberfest thinks that is very sweet 

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:23.039
 and I hope you have that 

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:25.310
 she has to die and she has to go next time 

00:05:23.039 --> 00:05:25.310
 again
