suppose<00:00:05.940> that<00:00:05.970> you<00:00:06.240> and<00:00:06.569> two<00:00:06.720> of<00:00:06.750> your<00:00:06.990> friends

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.350 
suppose that you and two of your friends

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:09.500 
suppose that you and two of your friends
are<00:00:07.529> splitting<00:00:08.010> a<00:00:08.069> pizza<00:00:08.429> for<00:00:08.580> dinner<00:00:08.670> when

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
are splitting a pizza for dinner when

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.480 
are splitting a pizza for dinner when
you<00:00:09.630> open<00:00:09.870> the<00:00:09.960> pizza<00:00:10.230> box<00:00:10.410> you<00:00:10.769> see<00:00:10.800> there<00:00:11.309> are

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
you open the pizza box you see there are

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.570 
you open the pizza box you see there are
12<00:00:11.940> slices<00:00:12.530> you<00:00:13.530> want<00:00:13.740> to<00:00:13.799> be<00:00:13.889> fair<00:00:14.219> and<00:00:14.250> make

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
12 slices you want to be fair and make

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.340 
12 slices you want to be fair and make
sure<00:00:14.759> everyone<00:00:15.150> gets<00:00:15.360> the<00:00:15.570> same<00:00:15.599> number<00:00:16.320> of

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
sure everyone gets the same number of

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.960 
sure everyone gets the same number of
slices<00:00:17.090> how<00:00:18.090> many<00:00:18.420> slices<00:00:18.779> does<00:00:19.140> everyone<00:00:19.410> get

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:19.970 
slices how many slices does everyone get

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:23.480 
slices how many slices does everyone get
this<00:00:20.970> is<00:00:21.180> a<00:00:21.210> very<00:00:21.869> important<00:00:22.619> problem<00:00:22.890> because

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
this is a very important problem because

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.130 
this is a very important problem because
we're<00:00:24.300> talking<00:00:24.510> about<00:00:24.810> pizza<00:00:25.320> here<00:00:26.960> one<00:00:27.960> way

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
we're talking about pizza here one way

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.349 
we're talking about pizza here one way
to<00:00:28.199> solve<00:00:28.500> this<00:00:28.710> is<00:00:28.980> to<00:00:29.400> have<00:00:29.550> everyone<00:00:30.090> take<00:00:30.300> a

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
to solve this is to have everyone take a

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.840 
to solve this is to have everyone take a
turn<00:00:30.599> picking<00:00:31.019> a<00:00:31.080> slice<00:00:31.399> first<00:00:32.399> everyone

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
turn picking a slice first everyone

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.630 
turn picking a slice first everyone
takes<00:00:33.239> one<00:00:33.510> slice<00:00:33.840> then<00:00:34.649> everyone<00:00:35.250> takes<00:00:35.489> a

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
takes one slice then everyone takes a

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.450 
takes one slice then everyone takes a
second<00:00:35.969> slice<00:00:36.260> next<00:00:37.260> everyone<00:00:37.829> takes<00:00:38.040> a<00:00:38.219> third

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
second slice next everyone takes a third

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.119 
second slice next everyone takes a third
slice<00:00:38.790> and<00:00:39.120> finally<00:00:39.930> everyone<00:00:40.649> takes<00:00:40.920> a

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
slice and finally everyone takes a

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.940 
slice and finally everyone takes a
fourth<00:00:41.340> slice<00:00:41.640> so<00:00:42.540> everyone<00:00:43.350> gets<00:00:43.559> four

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
fourth slice so everyone gets four

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.799 
fourth slice so everyone gets four
slices<00:00:45.230> this<00:00:46.230> is<00:00:46.590> division<00:00:46.950> we<00:00:47.850> divided<00:00:48.450> 12

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
slices this is division we divided 12

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.080 
slices this is division we divided 12
slices<00:00:49.110> of<00:00:49.559> pizza<00:00:49.710> among<00:00:50.280> three<00:00:50.520> people<00:00:50.850> and

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
slices of pizza among three people and

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.410 
slices of pizza among three people and
everyone<00:00:51.809> got<00:00:52.020> four<00:00:52.410> slices<00:00:53.030> we<00:00:54.030> write<00:00:54.270> this

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
everyone got four slices we write this

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.709 
everyone got four slices we write this
mathematically<00:00:54.600> like<00:00:55.530> this<00:00:56.329> we<00:00:57.329> say<00:00:57.539> this

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
mathematically like this we say this

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.970 
mathematically like this we say this
aloud<00:00:57.989> as<00:00:58.320> 12<00:00:58.710> divided<00:00:59.219> by<00:00:59.250> 3<00:00:59.309> equals<00:00:59.760> 4<00:01:00.390> that

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:00.980 
aloud as 12 divided by 3 equals 4 that

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:03.380 
aloud as 12 divided by 3 equals 4 that
symbol<00:01:01.980> with<00:01:02.190> two<00:01:02.489> dots<00:01:02.640> is<00:01:02.940> called<00:01:03.270> the

symbol with two dots is called the

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.570 
symbol with two dots is called the
division<00:01:03.629> sign<00:01:04.049> you<00:01:04.860> can<00:01:05.010> also<00:01:05.159> call<00:01:05.430> it<00:01:05.549> the

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
division sign you can also call it the

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.890 
division sign you can also call it the
division<00:01:06.090> symbol<00:01:07.130> let's<00:01:08.130> do<00:01:08.369> another<00:01:08.490> example

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:08.900

ending suppose we want to divide 14 gold
coins<00:01:15.869> among<00:01:16.470> four<00:01:16.830> Pirates<00:01:17.490> the<00:01:18.390> Pirates

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
coins among four Pirates the Pirates

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.840 
coins among four Pirates the Pirates
take<00:01:19.200> turns<00:01:19.470> picking<00:01:19.740> a<00:01:20.009> coin<00:01:20.250> until<00:01:20.520> they're

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
take turns picking a coin until they're

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:32.420 
take turns picking a coin until they're

the<00:01:33.180> first<00:01:33.210> two<00:01:33.810> pirates<00:01:34.229> each<00:01:34.439> got<00:01:34.680> 4<00:01:34.979> coins

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
the first two pirates each got 4 coins

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.120 
the first two pirates each got 4 coins
but<00:01:35.729> the<00:01:35.880> last<00:01:36.090> who<00:01:36.329> only<00:01:36.479> got<00:01:36.689> 3<00:01:37.049> that's<00:01:37.829> not

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
but the last who only got 3 that's not

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.999 
but the last who only got 3 that's not
fair<00:01:38.840> let's<00:01:39.840> take<00:01:40.079> those<00:01:40.229> extras<00:01:40.740> away<00:01:40.950> so

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
fair let's take those extras away so

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.060 
fair let's take those extras away so
everyone<00:01:41.820> has<00:01:42.030> the<00:01:42.180> same<00:01:42.210> number<00:01:42.689> of<00:01:42.720> coins<00:01:43.070> so

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
everyone has the same number of coins so

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.399 
everyone has the same number of coins so
each<00:01:44.340> pirate<00:01:44.729> gets<00:01:45.030> 3<00:01:45.360> coins<00:01:45.659> and<00:01:46.049> there<00:01:46.290> are

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
each pirate gets 3 coins and there are

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.060 
each pirate gets 3 coins and there are
two<00:01:46.649> left<00:01:47.220> over<00:01:48.170> this<00:01:49.170> is<00:01:49.439> something<00:01:49.829> new

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
two left over this is something new

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.960 
two left over this is something new
after<00:01:50.490> the<00:01:51.329> division<00:01:51.570> there<00:01:52.200> were<00:01:52.380> leftovers

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:52.970 
after the division there were leftovers

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:57.230 
after the division there were leftovers
we<00:01:53.970> call<00:01:54.210> those<00:01:54.420> leftovers<00:01:55.110> the<00:01:55.649> remainder<00:01:56.240> we

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
we call those leftovers the remainder we

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.160 
we call those leftovers the remainder we
write<00:01:57.479> this<00:01:57.750> mathematically<00:01:58.159> like<00:01:59.159> this<00:02:00.170> we

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
write this mathematically like this we

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.310 
write this mathematically like this we
say<00:02:01.380> this<00:02:01.530> aloud<00:02:01.829> as<00:02:02.130> 14<00:02:02.759> divided<00:02:03.360> by<00:02:03.390> 4<00:02:03.719> equals

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
say this aloud as 14 divided by 4 equals

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.639 
say this aloud as 14 divided by 4 equals
3<00:02:04.430> remainder<00:02:05.430> 2<00:02:06.020> instead<00:02:07.020> of<00:02:07.079> writing<00:02:07.439> the

3 remainder 2 instead of writing the
word<00:02:07.680> remainder<00:02:08.280> people<00:02:08.970> will<00:02:09.090> often<00:02:09.450> write

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
word remainder people will often write

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:12.070 
word remainder people will often write
it<00:02:09.720> as<00:02:09.869> 14<00:02:10.590> divided<00:02:10.950> by<00:02:11.009> 4<00:02:11.280> equals<00:02:11.790> 3
