00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:33.199

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.840
 all srl 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:13.980
 I'm the big brother of Stefano 

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:17.470
 stefano had not told me, in fact, that one is being made 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:19.870
 but like everyone 

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:22.870
 stefano will come soon 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:25.140
 wow 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.140
 this is your midday stay 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.650
 good for a single summer text 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:33.940
 it's a bit who's there for my taste 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:37.130
 I understand why it makes me feel so happy 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:38.250
 it was time 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.940
 I thought he would never recover with light 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:43.940
 almost destroyed 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.440
 what a gratification 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.300
 but you have not yet touched on the embarrassing subject of the ex 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:58.120
 oops sooner or later will come out 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:01.850
 maybe I didn't tell you because you don't want him to think he's a dpr 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.240
 we all know 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.999
 how the story ends 

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:10.999
 I told you how each story was destined 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:14.419
 I'm sad 

00:02:14.419 --> 00:02:17.089

00:02:17.089 --> 00:02:18.829
 belen 

00:02:18.829 --> 00:02:22.809
 I knew you would be gone I should have called it not being choca que 

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:25.809
 come when you want to lose yourself 

00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:29.799
 if I should take family albums or some movies in a but 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:32.329
 I must warn you 

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:35.479
 It wasn't always so cute, thanks for stopping by 

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:38.479
 it was nice to see you 

00:02:39.999 --> 00:02:40.999
 me already 

00:02:40.999 --> 00:02:42.919
 a woman in the sea 

00:02:42.919 --> 00:02:45.909
 nice to meet you 

00:02:45.909 --> 00:02:48.909
 the pleasure is my elena 

00:03:12.869 --> 00:03:14.539
 beautiful girl 

00:03:14.539 --> 00:03:17.539
 between character 

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:21.959
 and instead you are registered 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:23.909
 where the hell have you been today 

00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:25.679
 let me guess 

00:03:25.679 --> 00:03:28.659
 in the hospital I had to fix this mess 

00:03:28.659 --> 00:03:29.859
 and he did it 

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:32.319
 the three powers of persuasion worked 

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:35.919
 remember that if you don't feed yourself how you should these tricks don't work by how much 

00:03:35.919 --> 00:03:36.719
 it's tender here 

00:03:36.719 --> 00:03:38.769
 are you worried 

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:41.769
 tell me that we are destined to repeat the passage 

00:03:42.539 --> 00:03:47.299
 this is why you play the high school I'm not playing cinecittÃ  

00:03:48.909 --> 00:03:51.930
 we know that the only way to get closer to humans is what 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:53.940
 tears up 13 me 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:56.940
