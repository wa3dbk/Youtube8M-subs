00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
glad that this marble can be completed

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.060 
glad that this marble can be completed
before<00:00:35.969> the<00:00:36.180> Computex<00:00:36.809> and<00:00:37.140> this<00:00:37.649> is<00:00:37.800> a<00:00:37.829> new

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
before the Computex and this is a new

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.430 
before the Computex and this is a new
pure<00:00:38.670> awesome<00:00:39.120> article<00:00:39.510> from<00:00:39.660> a<00:00:39.870> strong<00:00:40.170> it's

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
pure awesome article from a strong it's

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.610 
pure awesome article from a strong it's
called<00:00:40.649> z77<00:00:41.430> OC<00:00:41.850> formula<00:00:42.300> and<00:00:43.140> you<00:00:43.260> can<00:00:43.440> see

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
called z77 OC formula and you can see

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.010 
called z77 OC formula and you can see
the<00:00:43.890> color<00:00:44.219> is<00:00:44.520> with<00:00:44.730> black<00:00:45.030> and<00:00:45.390> yellow<00:00:45.570> and

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
the color is with black and yellow and

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.160 
the color is with black and yellow and
especially<00:00:46.920> we<00:00:47.610> have<00:00:47.969> older<00:00:48.420> designs<00:00:48.809> for

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
especially we have older designs for

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.920 
especially we have older designs for
fewer<00:00:49.559> overclocking<00:00:50.340> something<00:00:51.329> like<00:00:51.510> you

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
fewer overclocking something like you

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.850 
fewer overclocking something like you
see<00:00:52.140> that<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:52.620> show<00:00:52.949> faces<00:00:53.340> on<00:00:54.120> a<00:00:54.149> cpu<00:00:54.390> then<00:00:55.320> we

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
see that the show faces on a cpu then we

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.060 
see that the show faces on a cpu then we
got<00:00:56.250> a<00:00:56.280> dual<00:00:56.699> spec<00:00:57.210> most<00:00:57.629> yeah<00:00:58.500> so<00:00:58.770> it's

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
got a dual spec most yeah so it's

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.729 
got a dual spec most yeah so it's
including<00:00:59.699> to<00:01:00.270> high<00:01:00.480> side<00:01:00.780> and<00:01:00.989> two<00:01:01.199> low<00:01:01.410> side

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
including to high side and two low side

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.149 
including to high side and two low side
in<00:01:02.340> with<00:01:02.609> the<00:01:02.820> each<00:01:03.149> space<00:01:03.510> so<00:01:04.320> it<00:01:04.530> is<00:01:04.830> make

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
in with the each space so it is make

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:06.950 
in with the each space so it is make
sure<00:01:05.189> the<00:01:05.700> efficiency<00:01:06.060> of<00:01:06.450> the<00:01:06.750> feed

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
sure the efficiency of the feed

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.899 
sure the efficiency of the feed
available<00:01:07.380> becomes<00:01:07.830> a<00:01:07.950> much<00:01:08.250> better<00:01:08.580> than

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
available becomes a much better than

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.240 
available becomes a much better than
other<00:01:09.479> multiples<00:01:09.990> yeah

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
other multiples yeah

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.540 
other multiples yeah
we<00:01:11.790> have<00:01:11.940> the<00:01:12.090> 14th<00:01:12.630> victim<00:01:13.160> led<00:01:14.160> the

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:14.550 
we have the 14th victim led the

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:17.480 
we have the 14th victim led the
particles<00:01:15.060> and<00:01:15.570> also<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:16.110> plus<00:01:16.350> and<00:01:17.190> minus

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
particles and also the plus and minus

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.300 
particles and also the plus and minus
you<00:01:17.850> can<00:01:18.030> choose<00:01:18.330> you<00:01:19.080> can<00:01:19.230> use<00:01:19.380> for<00:01:19.620> the<00:01:19.830> vicar

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
you can choose you can use for the vicar

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.480 
you can choose you can use for the vicar
or<00:01:20.610> you<00:01:20.820> use<00:01:21.090> for<00:01:21.330> the<00:01:21.510> amount<00:01:22.110> higher<00:01:22.490> and

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
or you use for the amount higher and

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.270 
or you use for the amount higher and
also<00:01:23.880> this<00:01:24.030> is<00:01:24.210> hailing<00:01:24.810> it's<00:01:25.140> layered<00:01:25.680> PCB

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
also this is hailing it's layered PCB

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.420 
also this is hailing it's layered PCB
and<00:01:26.520> two<00:01:26.760> lumps<00:01:27.260> yeah<00:01:28.260> and<00:01:28.650> also<00:01:28.860> the<00:01:29.100> memory

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
we will show the memory filters in the

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.950 
we will show the memory filters in the
next<00:01:31.830> few<00:01:31.979> days<00:01:32.220> because<00:01:32.430> we<00:01:33.119> can<00:01:33.330> do<00:01:33.540> each
