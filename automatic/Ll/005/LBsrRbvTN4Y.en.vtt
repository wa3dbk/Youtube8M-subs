applications<00:02:36.120> I<00:02:36.330> really<00:02:36.599> love<00:02:36.780> it<00:02:36.930> a<00:02:36.959> lot<00:02:37.050> and

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
applications I really love it a lot and

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.960 
applications I really love it a lot and
the<00:02:39.000> black<00:02:39.300> paint<00:02:39.709> is<00:02:40.709> actually<00:02:41.160> a<00:02:41.610> matte

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
the black paint is actually a matte

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:45.350 
the black paint is actually a matte
black<00:02:42.269> so<00:02:43.080> it<00:02:43.739> really<00:02:43.950> complements<00:02:44.730> all<00:02:44.879> the

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
black so it really complements all the

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.420 
black so it really complements all the
shiny<00:02:45.660> red<00:02:45.989> that<00:02:46.319> they<00:02:46.620> are<00:02:46.709> using<00:02:47.160> you<00:02:47.310> know

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
shiny red that they are using you know

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.780 
shiny red that they are using you know
mix<00:02:47.819> the<00:02:48.180> figure<00:02:48.750> pop<00:02:48.989> even<00:02:49.230> more

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
mix the figure pop even more

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:53.570 
mix the figure pop even more
okay<00:02:50.840> so<00:02:52.010> let's<00:02:53.010> move<00:02:53.190> on<00:02:53.370> to<00:02:53.400> the

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
okay so let's move on to the

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:56.619 
okay so let's move on to the
articulation<00:02:54.650> okay

00:02:56.619 --> 00:02:56.629 
articulation okay

00:02:56.629 --> 00:03:01.309 
articulation okay
zoom<00:02:57.629> out<00:02:58.700> okay<00:02:59.700> the<00:02:59.819> articulation<00:03:00.540> first<00:03:01.140> off

00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:01.319 
zoom out okay the articulation first off

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:04.550 
zoom out okay the articulation first off
the<00:03:01.500> head<00:03:01.680> can<00:03:01.830> look<00:03:02.010> up<00:03:02.220> this<00:03:02.489> far<00:03:02.790> and<00:03:03.560> down

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
the head can look up this far and down

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:10.490 
the head can look up this far and down
this<00:03:04.860> far<00:03:05.360> left<00:03:06.360> right<00:03:07.260> to<00:03:08.010> side-to-side<00:03:09.500> the

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
this far left right to side-to-side the

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.500 
this far left right to side-to-side the
shoulder<00:03:10.890> has<00:03:11.159> very<00:03:11.580> limited<00:03:11.909> articulation

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
shoulder has very limited articulation

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:15.140 
shoulder has very limited articulation
due<00:03:13.230> to<00:03:13.409> the<00:03:13.560> size<00:03:13.800> of<00:03:14.010> the<00:03:14.190> arbor<00:03:14.610> pots<00:03:14.909> over

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
due to the size of the arbor pots over

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:19.130 
due to the size of the arbor pots over
here<00:03:15.569> so<00:03:16.940> it<00:03:17.940> is<00:03:18.090> on<00:03:18.300> a<00:03:18.330> ball-joint<00:03:18.629> but<00:03:18.989> you

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140 
here so it is on a ball-joint but you

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:21.920 
here so it is on a ball-joint but you
can't<00:03:19.379> really<00:03:19.560> move<00:03:19.709> it<00:03:19.950> so<00:03:20.730> you<00:03:21.360> can<00:03:21.599> still

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
can't really move it so you can still

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:24.460 
can't really move it so you can still
rotate<00:03:22.140> it<00:03:22.500> a<00:03:22.590> little<00:03:22.620> bit<00:03:23.010> about<00:03:23.370> there<00:03:23.790> and

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:24.470 
rotate it a little bit about there and

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:27.979 
rotate it a little bit about there and
there's<00:03:25.470> upper<00:03:25.680> bicep<00:03:25.980> swivel<00:03:26.989> double

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:27.989 
there's upper bicep swivel double

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:31.720 
there's upper bicep swivel double
jointed<00:03:28.290> double<00:03:29.190> jointed<00:03:29.459> our<00:03:29.670> forearm<00:03:30.629> and

ball hinge joint at the hands same for

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.390 
ball hinge joint at the hands same for
the<00:03:36.030> other<00:03:36.209> side<00:03:36.590> the<00:03:37.590> torso<00:03:37.980> can<00:03:38.159> move

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
the other side the torso can move

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:39.050 
the other side the torso can move
forward

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.670 
point up some things that I'm
experiencing<00:03:48.060> with<00:03:48.209> this<00:03:48.360> figure<00:03:48.690> okay

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
experiencing with this figure okay

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:53.720 
experiencing with this figure okay
oh<00:03:51.080> when<00:03:52.080> when<00:03:52.590> I<00:03:52.620> bend<00:03:52.920> the<00:03:53.099> figure<00:03:53.400> down<00:03:53.549> like

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:53.730 
oh when when I bend the figure down like

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:56.149 
oh when when I bend the figure down like
that<00:03:53.909> right<00:03:54.319> actually<00:03:55.319> or<00:03:55.560> it<00:03:55.950> will<00:03:56.069> cause

00:03:56.149 --> 00:03:56.159 
that right actually or it will cause

00:03:56.159 --> 00:03:59.770 
that right actually or it will cause
some<00:03:56.220> scratches<00:03:56.939> on<00:03:57.120> the<00:03:57.989> body<00:03:58.439> toes

00:03:59.770 --> 00:03:59.780 
some scratches on the body toes

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:04.610 
some scratches on the body toes
area<00:04:00.780> over<00:04:01.140> here<00:04:01.280> so<00:04:02.280> so<00:04:03.120> you<00:04:03.180> know<00:04:03.470> you<00:04:04.470> just

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
area over here so so you know you just

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:06.920 
area over here so so you know you just
have<00:04:04.860> to<00:04:04.980> be<00:04:05.159> careful<00:04:06.150> about<00:04:06.239> it<00:04:06.569> you<00:04:06.659> want<00:04:06.840> to

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
have to be careful about it you want to

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:09.789 
have to be careful about it you want to
scratch<00:04:07.200> the<00:04:07.409> paint<00:04:07.439> applications<00:04:08.659> and

00:04:09.789 --> 00:04:09.799 
scratch the paint applications and

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:12.500 
scratch the paint applications and
that's<00:04:10.799> one<00:04:11.489> of<00:04:11.519> the<00:04:11.610> problems<00:04:12.030> that<00:04:12.120> I<00:04:12.239> have

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510 
that's one of the problems that I have

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:17.150 
that's one of the problems that I have
with<00:04:12.540> the<00:04:12.930> figure<00:04:13.439> okay<00:04:14.330> so<00:04:15.590> Lake<00:04:16.590> movement<00:04:17.040> is

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 
with the figure okay so Lake movement is

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:18.690 
with the figure okay so Lake movement is
also<00:04:17.370> fairly<00:04:17.910> limits

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:18.700 
also fairly limits

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:23.850 
also fairly limits
you<00:04:19.270> can<00:04:19.480> only<00:04:19.660> move<00:04:20.940> this<00:04:21.940> far<00:04:22.860> without

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:23.860 
you can only move this far without

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:26.430 
you can only move this far without
extending<00:04:24.460> it<00:04:24.700> no<00:04:25.240> this<00:04:25.510> far<00:04:25.750> forward<00:04:26.200> and

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:26.440 
extending it no this far forward and

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:30.360 
extending it no this far forward and
this<00:04:27.190> far<00:04:27.670> backwards<00:04:28.120> okay<00:04:29.190> even<00:04:30.190> if<00:04:30.340> you're

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:30.370 
this far backwards okay even if you're

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:33.180 
this far backwards okay even if you're
extended<00:04:30.970> or<00:04:31.150> it<00:04:31.330> doesn't<00:04:31.600> really<00:04:31.930> add<00:04:32.200> too

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:33.190 
extended or it doesn't really add too

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:36.960 
extended or it doesn't really add too
much<00:04:33.340> of<00:04:33.580> the<00:04:34.500> articulation<00:04:35.500> for<00:04:35.740> it<00:04:35.940> no<00:04:36.940> I

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:36.970 
much of the articulation for it no I

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:41.400 
much of the articulation for it no I
just<00:04:37.150> extend<00:04:37.690> it<00:04:37.810> and<00:04:38.620> it<00:04:39.630> just<00:04:40.630> move<00:04:40.780> this<00:04:41.110> far

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:41.410 
just extend it and it just move this far

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:43.860 
just extend it and it just move this far
as<00:04:42.070> well<00:04:42.340> it<00:04:42.700> doesn't<00:04:43.120> really<00:04:43.210> help<00:04:43.390> but<00:04:43.630> it's

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:43.870 
as well it doesn't really help but it's

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:49.380 
as well it doesn't really help but it's

I could really add some clearance to the

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:07.710 
I could really add some clearance to the
torso<00:06:05.500> so<00:06:05.980> that<00:06:06.010> the<00:06:06.340> pin<00:06:06.550> on<00:06:06.730> the<00:06:06.970> torso<00:06:07.420> were
