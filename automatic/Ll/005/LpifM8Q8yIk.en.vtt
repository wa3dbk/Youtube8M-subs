categories here as you can see and that

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.320 
categories here as you can see and that
many<00:01:19.049> of<00:01:19.140> these<00:01:19.259> obviously<00:01:19.680> are<00:01:20.369> easy<00:01:20.939> to

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
many of these obviously are easy to

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:22.789 
many of these obviously are easy to
access<00:01:21.360> and<00:01:21.960> you<00:01:22.020> might<00:01:22.170> know<00:01:22.320> how<00:01:22.500> to<00:01:22.530> get<00:01:22.740> to

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
access and you might know how to get to

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.460 
access and you might know how to get to
them<00:01:23.009> already<00:01:23.310> others<00:01:24.299> are<00:01:24.540> not<00:01:24.900> so<00:01:25.170> easy<00:01:25.380> to

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
them already others are not so easy to

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.679 
them already others are not so easy to
find<00:01:25.799> and<00:01:26.040> it<00:01:26.759> takes<00:01:26.970> a<00:01:27.060> while<00:01:27.180> to<00:01:27.420> get<00:01:27.540> to<00:01:27.570> that

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
find and it takes a while to get to that

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.600 
find and it takes a while to get to that
shortcut<00:01:28.140> so<00:01:28.590> that's<00:01:28.770> why<00:01:28.950> this<00:01:29.009> god<00:01:29.340> mode

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
shortcut so that's why this god mode

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:30.890 
shortcut so that's why this god mode
basically<00:01:30.030> puts<00:01:30.240> everything<00:01:30.630> all<00:01:30.750> in<00:01:30.780> one

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
basically puts everything all in one

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.530 
basically puts everything all in one
place<00:01:31.259> so<00:01:31.470> your<00:01:31.590> one-stop<00:01:32.070> shop<00:01:32.100> to<00:01:33.030> accessing

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
place so your one-stop shop to accessing

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.899 
place so your one-stop shop to accessing
everything<00:01:33.869> all<00:01:34.380> at<00:01:34.439> once<00:01:34.680> and<00:01:35.159> that's<00:01:35.670> why

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
everything all at once and that's why

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.460 
everything all at once and that's why
they're<00:01:36.060> calling<00:01:36.360> it<00:01:36.450> a<00:01:36.540> god<00:01:36.750> mode<00:01:36.990> but<00:01:37.350> it's

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
they're calling it a god mode but it's

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:38.660 
they're calling it a god mode but it's
not<00:01:37.619> really<00:01:37.829> giving<00:01:37.979> you<00:01:38.189> any<00:01:38.400> more

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
not really giving you any more

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.660 
not really giving you any more
additional<00:01:39.680> access<00:01:40.680> than<00:01:41.130> what<00:01:41.310> you<00:01:41.430> already

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
additional access than what you already

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.780 
additional access than what you already
have<00:01:42.210> so<00:01:42.479> it<00:01:42.540> doesn't<00:01:42.810> give<00:01:42.930> you<00:01:43.110> more<00:01:43.380> than

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:43.790 
have so it doesn't give you more than

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:46.249 
have so it doesn't give you more than
administrator<00:01:44.790> access<00:01:45.000> for<00:01:45.450> example<00:01:45.869> okay

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
administrator access for example okay

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.230 
administrator access for example okay
it's<00:01:46.380> the<00:01:46.439> same<00:01:46.470> thing<00:01:46.860> so<00:01:47.310> I<00:01:47.850> thought<00:01:48.119> I'd

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
it's the same thing so I thought I'd

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.899 
it's the same thing so I thought I'd

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
64 bit right now it's working fine it

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.859 
64 bit right now it's working fine it
has<00:01:53.130> not<00:01:53.340> crashed<00:01:53.640> on<00:01:53.939> me<00:01:54.119> even<00:01:54.299> though<00:01:54.450> it<00:01:54.689> has

been reported to crash on Windows Vista
64-bit<00:01:58.820> ok<00:01:59.820> so<00:02:00.299> you<00:02:00.360> might<00:02:00.689> want<00:02:00.869> to<00:02:00.930> keep<00:02:01.439> that

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
64-bit ok so you might want to keep that

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.160 
64-bit ok so you might want to keep that
in<00:02:01.710> mind<00:02:01.920> it<00:02:02.100> does<00:02:02.250> work<00:02:02.520> with<00:02:02.939> the<00:02:03.090> 32<00:02:03.390> version

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
in mind it does work with the 32 version

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.180 
in mind it does work with the 32 version
of<00:02:04.320> Windows<00:02:04.740> Vista<00:02:04.920> and<00:02:05.280> Windows<00:02:06.030> 7<00:02:06.890> however<00:02:07.890> I

of Windows Vista and Windows 7 however I

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.029 
of Windows Vista and Windows 7 however I
have<00:02:08.369> only<00:02:08.550> tested<00:02:08.879> this<00:02:09.239> in<00:02:09.509> Windows<00:02:10.470> 7<00:02:10.830> 64

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
have only tested this in Windows 7 64

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.610 
have only tested this in Windows 7 64
bit<00:02:11.430> I<00:02:11.730> will<00:02:11.970> test<00:02:12.270> it<00:02:12.420> of<00:02:12.510> course<00:02:12.720> in<00:02:12.989> Windows

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
bit I will test it of course in Windows

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.770 
bit I will test it of course in Windows
Vista<00:02:13.800> 64-bit<00:02:14.760> as<00:02:15.060> well<00:02:15.239> to<00:02:15.390> see<00:02:15.569> if<00:02:15.599> it

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780
