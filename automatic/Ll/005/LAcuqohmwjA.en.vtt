00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:09.860
 Dr 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:16.980
 9 8 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.130
 so now we are at the booth of the nursery harbor and the nursery 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:21.380
 Afghanistan 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:25.460
 one of the most famous rhododendron producers in Germany and the 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:27.029
 Owner Holger Hartmann 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.420
 is at the same time one of the most noble and breeders 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.020
 make undercut 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:37.020
 I would like to know from him what's up with Opel and who is looking for 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:37.700
 aims 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:41.050
 So our main breeding goal we are first and foremost the winter hardiness 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.360
 despite global warming still an issue which percent certainly the 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:45.950
 Garden lovers interested 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:49.550
 then of course, percent new flower colors in the direction of Galpin 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:52.470
 two-tone percent pink with stain 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:54.159
 Percent robustness bulk 

00:00:54.159 --> 00:00:58.030
 Compactness Percent of plants for the decreasing crops 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:02.770
 And the cantons have also taken a new trend that has also happened 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:05.300
 they say tag tolerance euro-bund changes 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:09.610
 in Kharkov, what exactly does it have on it so Karg is more tolerant 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:13.800
 or Danones a new order from the location which has been developed by 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:17.320
 the 25 Ortenburger and probably already the tree schools 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:20.880
 which are as a support but for many titles worry 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:26.130
 to change the products around a newly designed underlay 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:30.950
 Not usual was then and soils very well flourish in the Ohl 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:32.180
 Has vitality 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:34.810
 and thereby the dissemination of it was then and throughout the Federal territory 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:36.150
 by percent 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.150
 allows my current favorites are once the 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:41.750
 Melanie 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:43.220
 and the Gollin Etter 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:46.820
 because the canteen september choose something special 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:47.710
 van der Vaart 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:49.280
 only bruises 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:50.830
 it should be 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:54.310
 the runner-up 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:55.940
 Reinhard Winter 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:58.940
 through that but also with our customers 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:05.159
 I sit here together with Tomas Poll the bzÃ¶ storms leader at Cordes Rosen 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:08.159
 one of the biggest European rose producers 

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:14.359
 Fragrant roses also looks like the best we can do in the future 

00:02:14.359 --> 00:02:16.550
 expect more fragrant roses again 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:18.229
 who say that who he means 

00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:22.149
 but until the soul of a rose and we always do so and in ours 

00:02:22.149 --> 00:02:25.649
 Tent around the program, the fragrance also plays a very important role 

00:02:25.649 --> 00:02:28.549
 the Arabs Cordes as the highest breeding Steel always the sheet 

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:33.329
 Health is the name of the fragrance is an addition to a healthy 

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:37.179
 Rosaura the combination of both healthy challenge for the future 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:41.430
 flat health sounds good you do not have to inject it that's great 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:45.760
 What are the trends in the roses which roses? 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.759
 Groups are in demand in the room 

00:02:47.759 --> 00:02:51.559

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:54.239
 of 1 the climbing roses Land one 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:57.139
 Collection on the market brought Klettermaxe the very very good 

00:02:57.139 --> 00:03:00.299
 Demanded are very robust varieties and the equipment Spohn 

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:03.680
 I think that knows a bit about percent small gardens 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.019
 smaller gardens where 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:09.019
 at the percent gave friends pruder climbing rose, flour soup goes third 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:12.890
 Dimension upwards and can be so space-saving and just about the same 

00:03:12.889 --> 00:03:17.260
 the rail is coming in I think I have a big demand with dwarf big ones 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:21.019
 Of course, many people also want their balconies in their patio in pots 

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:25.079
 with roses percent of the finances and for that, these are newer to his healthy 

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:28.079
 Varieties we in the group of Libero to have we very popular 

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:32.129
