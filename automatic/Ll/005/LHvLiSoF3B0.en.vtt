00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:15.660
 pip pip already upon seeing the first 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.580
 photos of the lemon c4 picasso 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.529
 I had the hope that this car would ever be in it 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.820
 endurance test would come 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.990
 you know i'm always wanting me now 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.640
 new car 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.830
 but if you have a lot more twisted the 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.720
 People only really feel the impact of it 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.160
 such a car on the public for example and 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.850
 especially if it is a model with such 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.680
 own face and now we are 35,000 kilometers on 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.660
 have put this car and say goodbye 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:43.290
 taking a will has become very clear 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:44.910
 everyone finds the benefit of the first 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.559
 blow is immediately worth a daalder though 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.850
 if you have a car for half a year intensive 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.900
 we can of course still use a lot 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.580
 more things 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.990
 then we just got that as we were allowed in 

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:53.760
 already take you to the now traditional 

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:54.690
 car weeks winter trip 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.310
 there are with it to the beaches of 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.500
 been home to normandy 

00:00:56.310 --> 00:01:00.480
 the stock exchange of geneva and he is bad 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.160
 used intensively as a production car at 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.930
 the recordings of car week big angry for us 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.940
 new television program 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.860
 and we also have a double test 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:09.900
 done against the kia carens and and 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.100
 compared to a c4 grand picasso and 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:16.220
 with the xsara picasso 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.220
 all in all fully milked this car 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:20.580
 and got stuck during all those stories 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:22.619
 necessary things 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.540
 to start with this c4 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.860
 picasso is a very relaxed place 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.880
 wooden and so maybe still real 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.950
 to approach 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.360
 very suitable for long journeys 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.520
 less floating than its predecessor 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.050
 you still feel very much 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.700
 kind-hearted character in it 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:37.710
 sit undercarriage 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.970
 as soon as the many kilos activate rest 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.040
 then you notice that the car is not real 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.229
 is made in one way or another 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.119
 especially the rear axle there is too much 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.560
 weak and the damping also fails 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.990
 it all neatly in line 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.940
 so if you are with four people and luggage 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.100
 the car is going to dance very much 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:55.280
 I personally don't mind observing 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.280
 nice 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:03.800
 oh yes see how he made a small typo 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.370
 this 7 is not a fan of this anyway 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:14.320
 boktor let me give an example I 'm going 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:16.090
 often to my parents and when I am 

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:18.340
 and then he can choose between one 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:20.860
 supply route on the main roads or a 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:23.260
 very cool meandering in between 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:24.100
 in with this c4 picasso you choose normal 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.470
 in front of 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:28.300
 straight forward nice cruising through 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:30.910
 turns young people always car too heavy 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:32.920
 before he feels the big hold on 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:35.160
 nice on straight roads then it's gone 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.160
 his place 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.819
 this 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:53.720
 And then the powertrain we have the one 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.550
 point 6 e-hdi and four-cylinder one 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:57.320
 diesel with 112 hp 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:59.030
 and to be honest it is only just 

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:01.400
 enough for this car 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:02.840
 and in particular among often entered in 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.960
 little home you really need him a bit 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:05.520
 keep on steam 

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:07.290
 you do that is fine to live with 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:08.790
 that engine is linked to a 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:10.260
 manual gearbox with 6 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.460
 and we really have it 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.890
 nothing to complain about 

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:14.640
 switches smoothly switches clear little 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:16.290
 miss it 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:19.910
 we have recently had to deal with 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:19.910
 a cracking clutch pedal 

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:24.210
 follow citroÃ«n it's a matter of 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:25.320
 adjust and lubricate but remains 

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:27.510
 remarkable 

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:31.130
 but for the rest this c4 picasso is six 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:31.130
 months free from disruptions 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:39.230
 Well one more thing and I have to 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.230
 just park him 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.240
 the problem we are against it 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:43.950
 he is in the 

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:45.660
 unclearness of this car 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:47.930
 this dashboard is huge to begin with 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:51.120
 deep and that nose rather unclear 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:51.960
 and that causes problems with it 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:55.880
 parking 

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:55.880
 just look curb damage 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.350
 several colleagues are against it 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:00.060
 walked for example if you have one 

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:01.830
 parking garage is almost impossible to drive 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:03.180
 to spare them we can do that 

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:04.710
 natural wonder located on the 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.490
 drivers or by car 

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:09.350
 but the fact remains that he 

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:09.350
 unclear nose does not help 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:13.410
 overall we are just okay too 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:16.110
 speak about this c4 picasso it is and 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:16.500
 large, flexible, well- equipped family 

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:18.390
 car 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:21.450
 there is still a thing where you 

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:24.210
 take that into account and that is his 

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:25.740
 wiper fluid consumption because that 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:27.690
 a psh the irs with an average 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:30.180
 consumption of about 1 in 16 not at all 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:31.710
 so inefficient but because of that stays ahead 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:34.550
 you like this stuff 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:34.550
 refuel until you weigh an ounce
