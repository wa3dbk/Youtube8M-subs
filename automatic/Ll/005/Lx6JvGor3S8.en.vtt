00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
the way I like so I put a little bit

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:00.979 
the way I like so I put a little bit
more<00:00:59.609> in<00:00:59.760> and<00:00:59.910> that<00:00:59.969> should<00:01:00.239> be<00:01:00.359> enough<00:01:00.660> for<00:01:00.690> us

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
more in and that should be enough for us

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.700 
more in and that should be enough for us
right<00:01:01.170> there<00:01:01.469> now<00:01:02.250> we're<00:01:02.399> going<00:01:02.489> to<00:01:02.550> add<00:01:02.699> our

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:03.710

right there now we're going to add our
cracked<00:01:04.710> black<00:01:04.979> pepper<00:01:05.930> not<00:01:06.930> a<00:01:06.960> whole<00:01:07.260> lot

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
cracked black pepper not a whole lot

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:08.960 
cracked black pepper not a whole lot
remember<00:01:07.860> we<00:01:07.950> put<00:01:08.130> some<00:01:08.220> red<00:01:08.369> pepper<00:01:08.640> flakes

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.760 
remember we put some red pepper flakes
in<00:01:09.210> so<00:01:10.049> we're<00:01:10.200> just<00:01:10.229> going<00:01:10.409> to<00:01:10.500> add<00:01:10.850> enough

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:12.770 
in so we're just going to add enough

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:14.870 
in so we're just going to add enough
just<00:01:13.770> to<00:01:13.979> give<00:01:14.159> us<00:01:14.280> some<00:01:14.460> of<00:01:14.490> that<00:01:14.640> black

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
just to give us some of that black

just to give us some of that black
pepper<00:01:15.210> flavor<00:01:15.570> because<00:01:15.900> the<00:01:16.680> black<00:01:16.920> pepper

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
pepper flavor because the black pepper

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:18.830 
pepper flavor because the black pepper
flavor<00:01:17.520> is<00:01:17.729> actually<00:01:18.090> a<00:01:18.119> lot<00:01:18.299> different<00:01:18.750> than

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
flavor is actually a lot different than

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.560
