have<00:00:01.319> you<00:00:01.469> ever<00:00:01.680> thought<00:00:02.070> about<00:00:02.129> the

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:03.080 
have you ever thought about the

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:06.470 
have you ever thought about the
processes<00:00:04.080> that<00:00:04.920> your<00:00:05.190> brain<00:00:05.520> goes<00:00:05.940> through

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:06.480 
processes that your brain goes through

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.589 
processes that your brain goes through
as<00:00:06.810> you're<00:00:07.080> making<00:00:07.319> a<00:00:07.620> decision<00:00:08.389> one<00:00:09.389> of<00:00:09.510> the

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
as you're making a decision one of the

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:12.350 
as you're making a decision one of the
most<00:00:09.840> exciting<00:00:10.400> facts<00:00:11.400> that<00:00:11.910> come<00:00:12.090> out<00:00:12.240> of

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
most exciting facts that come out of

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.039 
most exciting facts that come out of
psychology<00:00:13.200> recently<00:00:13.860> is<00:00:14.089> how<00:00:15.089> the<00:00:15.150> two<00:00:15.719> sides

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
psychology recently is how the two sides

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.519 
psychology recently is how the two sides
of<00:00:16.289> your<00:00:16.350> brain<00:00:17.060> function<00:00:18.060> how<00:00:18.539> they<00:00:18.570> process

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
of your brain function how they process

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.099 
of your brain function how they process
the<00:00:19.859> data<00:00:20.160> that<00:00:20.670> you're<00:00:20.970> giving<00:00:21.449> them<00:00:21.630> to<00:00:21.900> make

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
the data that you're giving them to make

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.509 
the data that you're giving them to make
your<00:00:22.320> decisions<00:00:22.980> I<00:00:24.170> think<00:00:25.369> once<00:00:26.369> you

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
your decisions I think once you

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.330 
your decisions I think once you
understand<00:00:27.210> the<00:00:27.960> difference<00:00:28.619> between<00:00:28.800> the

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
understand the difference between the

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.299 
understand the difference between the
way<00:00:29.519> your<00:00:29.760> brain<00:00:30.230> computes<00:00:31.230> data<00:00:31.619> and<00:00:32.009> your

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
way your brain computes data and your

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.569 
way your brain computes data and your
left<00:00:32.640> brain<00:00:32.880> computes<00:00:33.510> data<00:00:33.920> you<00:00:34.920> will<00:00:35.280> be

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
left brain computes data you will be

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.209 
left brain computes data you will be
well<00:00:36.270> on<00:00:36.300> your<00:00:36.630> way<00:00:36.690> to<00:00:36.899> balancing<00:00:37.829> the<00:00:38.010> two

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
well on your way to balancing the two

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.319 
well on your way to balancing the two
sides<00:00:38.660> because<00:00:39.660> each<00:00:39.930> side<00:00:40.410> has<00:00:41.329> attributes

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
sides because each side has attributes

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.529 
sides because each side has attributes
that<00:00:42.780> you<00:00:42.840> can<00:00:43.260> use<00:00:43.559> in<00:00:43.860> your<00:00:44.070> life<00:00:44.340> but<00:00:45.180> unless

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
that you can use in your life but unless

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.799 
that you can use in your life but unless
you<00:00:45.780> really<00:00:46.350> know<00:00:46.680> how<00:00:47.309> to<00:00:47.340> balance<00:00:47.969> these<00:00:48.329> two

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
you really know how to balance these two

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.439 
you really know how to balance these two
side<00:00:49.250> tenders<00:00:50.250> are<00:00:50.430> you<00:00:50.640> going<00:00:51.000> to<00:00:51.149> tend

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
side tenders are you going to tend

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.600 
side tenders are you going to tend
toward<00:00:51.870> the<00:00:51.989> left<00:00:52.289> because<00:00:52.710> we<00:00:52.920> live<00:00:53.370> in<00:00:53.520> a

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
toward the left because we live in a

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.650 
toward the left because we live in a
culture<00:00:53.910> that<00:00:54.719> is<00:00:54.780> primarily<00:00:55.500> left<00:00:56.309> brain<00:00:56.789> so

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
culture that is primarily left brain so

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.229 
culture that is primarily left brain so
everyone<00:00:58.379> around<00:00:58.649> you<00:00:58.920> is<00:00:58.949> encourage<00:00:59.730> you<00:00:59.969> to

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
everyone around you is encourage you to

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.270 
everyone around you is encourage you to
be<00:01:00.390> left<00:01:00.719> brain<00:01:01.020> and<00:01:01.260> actually<00:01:02.010> there<00:01:02.190> are

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
be left brain and actually there are

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.609 
be left brain and actually there are
some<00:01:02.460> wonderful<00:01:03.000> attributes<00:01:03.449> that<00:01:04.170> you<00:01:04.409> can

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
some wonderful attributes that you can

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.219 
some wonderful attributes that you can
use<00:01:05.010> in<00:01:05.309> your<00:01:05.489> right<00:01:05.760> brain<00:01:06.030> so<00:01:06.750> let's<00:01:07.020> do<00:01:07.200> a

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
use in your right brain so let's do a

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.100 
use in your right brain so let's do a
quick<00:01:07.619> review<00:01:07.860> of<00:01:08.340> what<00:01:08.880> we<00:01:09.090> recently<00:01:09.420> learned

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
quick review of what we recently learned

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.740 
quick review of what we recently learned
about<00:01:10.619> how<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.130> two<00:01:11.640> sides<00:01:11.970> of<00:01:12.180> your<00:01:12.240> brain

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
about how the two sides of your brain

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.920 
about how the two sides of your brain
each<00:01:13.650> compute<00:01:14.610> the<00:01:14.909> information<00:01:15.689> you're

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
each compute the information you're

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.039 
each compute the information you're
giving<00:01:16.409> them<00:01:16.590> first<00:01:17.520> of<00:01:17.759> all<00:01:17.880> lets<00:01:18.450> the

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
giving them first of all lets the

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.140 
giving them first of all lets the
biggest<00:01:19.500> thing<00:01:19.740> about<00:01:19.770> the<00:01:20.220> left<00:01:20.460> brain<00:01:20.790> is

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
biggest thing about the left brain is

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.980 
biggest thing about the left brain is
that<00:01:21.960> it's<00:01:22.290> full<00:01:22.560> of<00:01:22.680> fear<00:01:23.009> it's<00:01:23.430> designed<00:01:24.090> to

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
that it's full of fear it's designed to

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.920 
that it's full of fear it's designed to
pick<00:01:25.409> up<00:01:25.560> danger<00:01:26.159> so<00:01:26.729> every<00:01:27.360> time<00:01:27.659> you're

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
pick up danger so every time you're

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.249 
pick up danger so every time you're
using<00:01:27.960> your<00:01:28.470> left<00:01:28.710> brain<00:01:28.979> you<00:01:29.610> will<00:01:30.119> feel<00:01:30.659> some

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
using your left brain you will feel some

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.640 
using your left brain you will feel some
anxiety<00:01:31.820> some<00:01:32.820> tension<00:01:33.479> some<00:01:33.869> stress<00:01:34.290> some

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
anxiety some tension some stress some

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.830 
anxiety some tension some stress some
fear<00:01:34.979> just<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:35.579> way<00:01:35.729> the<00:01:35.880> left<00:01:36.060> point<00:01:36.240> is<00:01:36.509> and

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
fear just the way the left point is and

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.590 
fear just the way the left point is and
if<00:01:37.110> you<00:01:37.229> swim<00:01:37.500> to<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:37.860> right<00:01:38.070> brain<00:01:38.430> that<00:01:39.360> goes

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
if you swim to the right brain that goes

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.630 
if you swim to the right brain that goes
away<00:01:39.930> there's<00:01:40.470> no<00:01:40.619> fear<00:01:40.920> and<00:01:41.070> the<00:01:41.189> right<00:01:41.369> brain

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
away there's no fear and the right brain

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.080 
away there's no fear and the right brain
doesn't<00:01:42.000> compute<00:01:42.869> fear<00:01:43.649> so<00:01:44.310> this<00:01:44.520> is<00:01:44.670> a<00:01:44.700> good

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
doesn't compute fear so this is a good

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.889 
doesn't compute fear so this is a good
way<00:01:45.270> to<00:01:45.329> shift<00:01:45.990> your<00:01:46.860> emotional<00:01:47.549> state<00:01:47.850> so<00:01:48.689> if

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
way to shift your emotional state so if

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.139 
way to shift your emotional state so if
you're<00:01:49.079> in<00:01:49.229> your<00:01:49.409> left<00:01:49.710> brain<00:01:49.979> you're<00:01:50.700> using

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
you're in your left brain you're using

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:57.010 
you're in your left brain you're using
logic<00:01:51.960> language<00:01:53.030> numbers<00:01:54.380> analysis<00:01:55.520> planning

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.020 
logic language numbers analysis planning

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.289 
logic language numbers analysis planning
comparison<00:01:58.020> judgment<00:01:58.979> in<00:01:59.130> the<00:01:59.579> past<00:01:59.880> of<00:02:00.240> the

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
left front whereas if you want to switch

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.760 
left front whereas if you want to switch
over<00:02:05.159> to<00:02:05.340> creativity<00:02:06.090> that's<00:02:07.020> right<00:02:07.439> brain

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
over to creativity that's right brain

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.190 
over to creativity that's right brain
and<00:02:08.009> the<00:02:08.640> right<00:02:08.849> brain<00:02:09.289> parallel<00:02:10.289> process

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 
and the right brain parallel process

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.280 
and the right brain parallel process
is<00:02:11.260> the<00:02:11.500> data<00:02:11.830> so<00:02:12.340> it's<00:02:12.580> one<00:02:12.970> big<00:02:13.300> collage<00:02:13.810> and

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
is the data so it's one big collage and

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:16.830 
is the data so it's one big collage and
in<00:02:15.010> the<00:02:15.129> right<00:02:15.340> brain<00:02:15.670> there's<00:02:16.269> no<00:02:16.510> fear

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
in the right brain there's no fear

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.390 
in the right brain there's no fear
there's<00:02:17.530> peace<00:02:17.890> joy<00:02:18.489> love<00:02:19.260> connection

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
there's peace joy love connection

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.190

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260 
want to know how to balance the two

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.920 
want to know how to balance the two
sides<00:03:02.560> of<00:03:02.739> your<00:03:02.860> brain<00:03:03.069> just<00:03:03.630> remember<00:03:04.630> to<00:03:04.750> go

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
sides of your brain just remember to go

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:08.370 
sides of your brain just remember to go
into<00:03:05.260> the<00:03:05.380> nail<00:03:05.620> an<00:03:06.069> easy<00:03:06.970> way<00:03:07.239> to<00:03:07.269> do<00:03:07.599> that<00:03:07.840> is

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:08.380 
into the nail an easy way to do that is

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:11.100 
into the nail an easy way to do that is
to<00:03:08.620> go<00:03:08.799> into<00:03:09.010> your<00:03:09.190> body<00:03:09.400> and<00:03:09.760> then<00:03:10.599> stay<00:03:11.079> there

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:11.110 
to go into your body and then stay there

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:12.900 
to go into your body and then stay there
as<00:03:11.410> long<00:03:11.440> as<00:03:11.650> you<00:03:11.920> want<00:03:12.220> you<00:03:12.459> try<00:03:12.670> that

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:12.910 
as long as you want you try that

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:15.270 
as long as you want you try that
parallel<00:03:13.420> processing<00:03:14.200> and<00:03:14.380> then<00:03:14.860> eventually

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280 
parallel processing and then eventually

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.640 
parallel processing and then eventually
if<00:03:15.760> you<00:03:15.819> decide<00:03:16.299> you<00:03:16.450> want<00:03:16.630> to<00:03:16.720> go<00:03:17.260> back<00:03:17.470> to

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
if you decide you want to go back to

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:19.740 
if you decide you want to go back to
your<00:03:17.769> left<00:03:18.040> brain<00:03:18.340> all<00:03:18.819> you<00:03:19.000> have<00:03:19.150> to<00:03:19.269> do<00:03:19.510> is

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750 
your left brain all you have to do is

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:21.870 
your left brain all you have to do is
make<00:03:20.350> a<00:03:20.380> list<00:03:20.650> that<00:03:21.040> puts<00:03:21.579> you<00:03:21.700> immediately

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:21.880 
make a list that puts you immediately

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:24.809 
make a list that puts you immediately
into<00:03:22.630> sequential<00:03:23.500> processing<00:03:24.459> it's<00:03:24.700> a

00:03:24.809 --> 00:03:24.819 
into sequential processing it's a

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:28.500 
into sequential processing it's a
website<00:03:25.090> and<00:03:26.130> so<00:03:27.130> now<00:03:27.790> you<00:03:27.850> know<00:03:28.239> how<00:03:28.450> to

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
website and so now you know how to

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:31.229 
website and so now you know how to
balance<00:03:28.780> both<00:03:29.290> sides<00:03:29.609> either<00:03:30.609> go<00:03:30.880> into<00:03:31.090> the

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:31.239 
balance both sides either go into the

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:33.650 
balance both sides either go into the
nail<00:03:31.569> or<00:03:31.840> go<00:03:32.109> into<00:03:32.380> the<00:03:32.500> past<00:03:32.680> of<00:03:33.040> the<00:03:33.130> future

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
nail or go into the past of the future

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:36.059 
nail or go into the past of the future
it's<00:03:34.660> your<00:03:34.810> choice<00:03:35.109> whether<00:03:35.530> you<00:03:35.709> want<00:03:35.799> to<00:03:35.980> be

00:03:36.059 --> 00:03:36.069 
it's your choice whether you want to be

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:38.819 
it's your choice whether you want to be
in<00:03:36.190> your<00:03:36.310> love<00:03:36.519> for<00:03:36.700> you<00:03:36.880> I<00:03:37.150> point<00:03:37.450> and<00:03:38.139> the

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:38.829 
in your love for you I point and the

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:41.430 
in your love for you I point and the
best<00:03:39.340> idea<00:03:39.790> is<00:03:39.880> to<00:03:39.910> balance<00:03:40.180> both<00:03:40.630> so<00:03:40.989> that<00:03:41.230> you

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:41.440 
best idea is to balance both so that you

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.740 
best idea is to balance both so that you
use<00:03:41.650> some<00:03:42.130> of<00:03:42.250> your<00:03:42.370> time<00:03:42.639> in<00:03:42.850> one<00:03:43.060> and<00:03:43.359> some<00:03:43.389> of

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:43.750 
use some of your time in one and some of

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:46.259 
use some of your time in one and some of
the<00:03:43.870> other<00:03:43.989> and<00:03:44.290> have<00:03:45.250> fun<00:03:45.489> exploring<00:03:45.970> how

00:03:46.259 --> 00:03:46.269 
the other and have fun exploring how

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:49.139 
the other and have fun exploring how
your<00:03:46.420> own<00:03:46.540> brain<00:03:46.870> works
