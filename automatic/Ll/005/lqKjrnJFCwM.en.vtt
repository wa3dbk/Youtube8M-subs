I'm<00:02:14.850> not<00:02:15.120> sure<00:02:15.360> if<00:02:15.420> you<00:02:15.540> could<00:02:15.660> see<00:02:15.720> that<00:02:15.990> very

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
I'm not sure if you could see that very

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.550 
I'm not sure if you could see that very
well<00:02:16.760> it<00:02:17.760> is<00:02:17.970> a<00:02:18.000> solid<00:02:18.510> tongue<00:02:18.750> so<00:02:19.140> I'm<00:02:19.230> hoping

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
well it is a solid tongue so I'm hoping

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.949 
well it is a solid tongue so I'm hoping
that<00:02:19.709> the<00:02:19.800> gore-tex<00:02:20.010> liner<00:02:20.490> holds<00:02:20.910> up<00:02:21.090> and<00:02:21.270> the

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959 
that the gore-tex liner holds up and the

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:24.500 
that the gore-tex liner holds up and the
boot<00:02:22.140> remains<00:02:22.440> waterproof<00:02:23.040> that<00:02:23.360> that<00:02:24.360> is

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
boot remains waterproof that that is

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.620 
boot remains waterproof that that is
kind<00:02:24.720> of<00:02:24.780> important<00:02:26.000> one<00:02:27.000> thing<00:02:27.150> I<00:02:27.240> did<00:02:27.420> notice

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
kind of important one thing I did notice

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:29.480 
kind of important one thing I did notice
when<00:02:27.840> I<00:02:27.900> put<00:02:28.140> these<00:02:28.260> on<00:02:28.319> I<00:02:28.530> don't<00:02:29.160> know<00:02:29.310> if<00:02:29.370> you

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:29.490 
when I put these on I don't know if you

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:31.070 
when I put these on I don't know if you
can<00:02:29.610> see<00:02:29.819> it<00:02:29.940> hidden<00:02:30.150> this<00:02:30.270> in<00:02:30.540> this<00:02:30.630> video<00:02:30.810> or

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
can see it hidden this in this video or

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.230 
can see it hidden this in this video or
not<00:02:31.200> but<00:02:32.190> when<00:02:32.310> I<00:02:32.340> put<00:02:32.580> these<00:02:32.700> on<00:02:32.760> and<00:02:33.000> I<00:02:33.060> walked

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240 
not but when I put these on and I walked

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.660 
not but when I put these on and I walked
on<00:02:33.450> a<00:02:33.510> hard<00:02:33.690> surface<00:02:33.930> the<00:02:34.770> bottom<00:02:35.130> of<00:02:35.250> the<00:02:35.370> sole

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
on a hard surface the bottom of the sole

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.320 
on a hard surface the bottom of the sole
seemed<00:02:36.060> a<00:02:36.450> bit<00:02:36.630> round<00:02:37.020> if<00:02:37.350> you<00:02:37.410> will<00:02:38.330> they

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
seemed a bit round if you will they

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:44.570 
seemed a bit round if you will they
weren't<00:02:39.600> necessarily<00:02:40.170> flat<00:02:40.650> if<00:02:42.380> if<00:02:43.430> if<00:02:44.430> you

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
weren't necessarily flat if if if you

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.760 
weren't necessarily flat if if if you
put<00:02:44.790> them<00:02:44.880> on<00:02:45.000> they<00:02:45.239> kind<00:02:45.480> of<00:02:45.630> rock<00:02:46.410> back<00:02:46.739> and

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.770 
put them on they kind of rock back and

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:49.610 
put them on they kind of rock back and
forth<00:02:47.160> left<00:02:47.520> to<00:02:47.790> right<00:02:48.000> I'm<00:02:48.720> thinking<00:02:49.410> that

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
forth left to right I'm thinking that

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.180 
forth left to right I'm thinking that
that<00:02:49.800> may<00:02:50.390> work<00:02:51.390> itself<00:02:51.870> out<00:02:52.110> once<00:02:52.709> you<00:02:52.920> wear

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
that may work itself out once you wear

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:57.229 
that may work itself out once you wear
them<00:02:53.510> only<00:02:54.510> time<00:02:54.900> will<00:02:55.080> tell<00:02:55.110> though<00:02:55.470> so<00:02:56.239> again

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239 
them only time will tell though so again

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:00.040 
them only time will tell though so again
this<00:02:57.390> is<00:02:57.570> a<00:02:57.600> video<00:02:57.930> on<00:02:58.230> the<00:02:58.530> danner<00:02:58.920> marine

the stitching all the way around it the

the stitching all the way around it the
fit<00:03:09.209> the<00:03:09.420> finish<00:03:10.040> really<00:03:11.040> impressed<00:03:11.519> with

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
everything these are a bit heavy as you

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.780 
everything these are a bit heavy as you
can<00:03:15.060> see<00:03:15.269> they<00:03:15.510> are<00:03:15.660> more<00:03:15.930> of<00:03:16.200> an<00:03:16.560> olive<00:03:16.790> drab

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
they show on on the internet so you may

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:27.110 
they show on on the internet so you may
want<00:03:26.130> to<00:03:26.160> take<00:03:26.340> that<00:03:26.549> into<00:03:26.820> consideration

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120

well this is not an all-around boot I

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:47.949 
well this is not an all-around boot I
would<00:03:43.920> consider<00:03:44.250> this<00:03:44.549> a<00:03:44.760> strictly<00:03:45.390> work<00:03:46.230> boot

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:47.959 
would consider this a strictly work boot

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:51.259 
would consider this a strictly work boot
they<00:03:48.959> are<00:03:49.110> heavy<00:03:49.880> obviously<00:03:50.880> they<00:03:51.120> have<00:03:51.239> a

d<00:04:48.980> I<00:04:49.220> will<00:04:49.610> say<00:04:49.760> that<00:04:49.880> these<00:04:50.090> boots<00:04:50.330> will<00:04:50.750> not

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:50.930 
d I will say that these boots will not

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:53.470 
d I will say that these boots will not
fit<00:04:51.290> you<00:04:51.440> and<00:04:51.620> with<00:04:51.920> they<00:04:52.730> may<00:04:52.970> fit<00:04:53.240> you<00:04:53.360> in

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:53.480 
fit you and with they may fit you in

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:56.380 
fit you and with they may fit you in
length<00:04:53.890> but<00:04:54.890> it<00:04:55.040> can<00:04:55.640> be<00:04:55.790> a<00:04:55.820> bit<00:04:56.090> deceiving

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:56.390 
length but it can be a bit deceiving

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:59.710 
length but it can be a bit deceiving
because<00:04:57.380> they're<00:04:57.860> a<00:04:57.890> bit<00:04:58.220> narrow<00:04:58.550> it<00:04:59.180> kind<00:04:59.570> of

00:04:59.710 --> 00:04:59.720 
because they're a bit narrow it kind of

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:03.580 
because they're a bit narrow it kind of
makes<00:05:00.020> you<00:05:00.140> think<00:05:00.260> that<00:05:01.660> they're<00:05:02.660> also<00:05:02.990> too

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:03.590 
makes you think that they're also too

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:06.340 
makes you think that they're also too
short<00:05:03.920> in<00:05:04.070> length<00:05:04.390> however<00:05:05.390> if<00:05:05.870> you<00:05:06.020> get<00:05:06.200> it<00:05:06.320> a

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:06.350 
short in length however if you get it a

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:08.950 
short in length however if you get it a
longer<00:05:06.770> size<00:05:07.160> it<00:05:07.970> also<00:05:08.120> grows<00:05:08.540> and<00:05:08.810> with

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:08.960 
longer size it also grows and with

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:12.190 
longer size it also grows and with
automatically<00:05:09.860> so<00:05:10.520> what<00:05:10.700> my<00:05:10.880> plans<00:05:11.210> are<00:05:11.480> are

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:12.200 
automatically so what my plans are are

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:16.950 
automatically so what my plans are are
to<00:05:12.380> get<00:05:12.560> just<00:05:13.430> a<00:05:13.640> a<00:05:13.940> wider<00:05:14.450> size<00:05:14.870> and<00:05:15.640> hopefully

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:16.960 
to get just a a wider size and hopefully

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:19.770 
to get just a a wider size and hopefully
hopefully<00:05:17.960> that'll<00:05:18.470> that'll<00:05:18.890> do<00:05:19.130> the<00:05:19.250> trick

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:19.780 
hopefully that'll that'll do the trick

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:24.480 
hopefully that'll that'll do the trick
