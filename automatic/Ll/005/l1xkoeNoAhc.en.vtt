quite different this one wasn't set up
by<00:01:42.210> causing<00:01:42.689> you<00:01:42.750> to<00:01:42.899> do<00:01:43.020> something<00:01:43.259> it's

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
by causing you to do something it's

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.740 
by causing you to do something it's
taken<00:01:44.130> what<00:01:44.280> you're<00:01:44.460> given<00:01:44.759> and<00:01:44.909> the<00:01:45.270> timing

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
taken what you're given and the timing

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.899 
taken what you're given and the timing
is<00:01:45.869> the<00:01:45.899> key<00:01:46.079> so<00:01:46.860> beautiful<00:01:47.369> when<00:01:47.490> you<00:01:47.579> place

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
is the key so beautiful when you place

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.999 
is the key so beautiful when you place
your<00:01:48.180> foot<00:01:48.450> down<00:01:48.600> after<00:01:48.990> a<00:01:49.020> kick<00:01:49.320> watch<00:01:49.740> this

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
your foot down after a kick watch this

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.520 
your foot down after a kick watch this
you<00:01:50.430> now<00:01:50.729> ground<00:01:51.240> yourself<00:01:51.630> momentarily

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
you now ground yourself momentarily

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.170 
you now ground yourself momentarily
where<00:01:53.040> your<00:01:53.189> weight<00:01:53.369> is<00:01:53.399> distributed<00:01:53.700> on<00:01:54.149> both

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
where your weight is distributed on both

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.330 
where your weight is distributed on both
so<00:01:54.509> on<00:01:54.600> the<00:01:54.720> second<00:01:55.079> one<00:01:55.200> he's<00:01:55.619> timing<00:01:56.009> it<00:01:56.219> as

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
so on the second one he's timing it as

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.789 
so on the second one he's timing it as
the<00:01:56.729> foot<00:01:56.969> is<00:01:57.090> coming<00:01:57.390> down<00:01:57.600> he<00:01:58.140> is<00:01:58.350> taking

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
the foot is coming down he is taking

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.679 
the foot is coming down he is taking
flight<00:01:59.100> you're<00:01:59.640> grounded<00:02:00.119> and<00:02:00.210> he's

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
flight you're grounded and he's

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.929 
flight you're grounded and he's
launching<00:02:01.229> just<00:02:01.710> incredible<00:02:02.549> incredible

timing<00:02:03.390> and<00:02:03.659> watch<00:02:03.810> as<00:02:03.990> he<00:02:04.110> drives<00:02:04.350> it

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
timing and watch as he drives it

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.679 
timing and watch as he drives it
straight<00:02:05.310> up<00:02:05.340> to<00:02:05.579> the<00:02:05.670> chin<00:02:05.820> and<00:02:05.880> you<00:02:06.060> see<00:02:06.240> he's
