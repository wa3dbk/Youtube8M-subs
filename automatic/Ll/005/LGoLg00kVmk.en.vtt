00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:49.970 
the power module on this frame so we're

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:52.360 
the power module on this frame so we're
not<00:00:50.060> going<00:00:50.239> to<00:00:50.300> be<00:00:50.390> covering<00:00:50.750> that<00:00:51.250> but<00:00:52.250> we

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:52.370 
not going to be covering that but we

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:53.860 
not going to be covering that but we
will<00:00:52.489> be<00:00:52.610> covering<00:00:52.640> the<00:00:53.180> installation<00:00:53.780> and

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:53.870 
will be covering the installation and

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:54.940 
will be covering the installation and
connection<00:00:54.290> of<00:00:54.410> all<00:00:54.560> the<00:00:54.680> components

required<00:00:55.280> to<00:00:55.760> get<00:00:56.180> a<00:00:56.239> pick<00:00:56.480> sock<00:00:56.660> in<00:00:56.809> the<00:00:56.899> air

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:57.430 
required to get a pick sock in the air

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:00.010 
required to get a pick sock in the air
so<00:00:58.430> our<00:00:58.610> first<00:00:58.790> step<00:00:59.030> is<00:00:59.180> going<00:00:59.270> to<00:00:59.450> be<00:00:59.750> to<00:00:59.899> kind

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:00.020 
so our first step is going to be to kind

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:01.569 
so our first step is going to be to kind
of<00:01:00.140> decide<00:01:00.470> where<00:01:00.710> all<00:01:00.860> your<00:01:00.980> components<00:01:01.489> are

00:01:01.569 --> 00:01:01.579 
of decide where all your components are

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:02.799 
of decide where all your components are
laid<00:01:01.760> out<00:01:01.790> I've<00:01:02.120> already<00:01:02.360> built<00:01:02.540> one<00:01:02.600> of<00:01:02.690> these

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:02.809 
laid out I've already built one of these

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:04.090 
laid out I've already built one of these
frames<00:01:03.110> so<00:01:03.290> I<00:01:03.350> know<00:01:03.440> where<00:01:03.739> everything<00:01:04.070> is

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:04.100 
frames so I know where everything is

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:05.469 
frames so I know where everything is
going<00:01:04.280> to<00:01:04.309> go<00:01:04.519> your<00:01:04.909> frame<00:01:05.149> might<00:01:05.329> be

00:01:05.469 --> 00:01:05.479 
going to go your frame might be

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:07.270 
going to go your frame might be
different<00:01:05.840> so<00:01:06.049> take<00:01:06.649> some<00:01:06.799> time<00:01:06.829> and<00:01:07.159> think

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:07.280 
different so take some time and think

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:08.410 
different so take some time and think
about<00:01:07.579> where<00:01:07.729> everything<00:01:08.000> is<00:01:08.060> going<00:01:08.210> to<00:01:08.270> go

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:08.420 
about where everything is going to go

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.200 
about where everything is going to go
and<00:01:08.600> plant<00:01:08.869> it<00:01:09.020> so<00:01:09.920> my<00:01:10.130> first<00:01:10.369> first<00:01:10.790> step<00:01:11.060> I'm

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.210 
and plant it so my first first step I'm

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:12.760 
and plant it so my first first step I'm
going<00:01:11.299> to<00:01:11.360> take<00:01:11.659> here<00:01:11.930> after<00:01:12.229> planning<00:01:12.619> and

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:12.770 
going to take here after planning and

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:14.080 
going to take here after planning and
deciding<00:01:13.189> where<00:01:13.310> everything<00:01:13.610> is<00:01:13.700> going<00:01:13.759> to<00:01:13.850> go

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:14.090 
deciding where everything is going to go

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:18.730 
deciding where everything is going to go
to<00:01:14.810> install<00:01:15.850> pixhawk<00:01:16.850> itself<00:01:17.420> and<00:01:18.319> now<00:01:18.619> I've

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:18.740 
to install pixhawk itself and now I've

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:22.719 
to install pixhawk itself and now I've
already<00:01:19.299> installed<00:01:20.299> the<00:01:20.509> included<00:01:21.229> pads<00:01:22.100> the

you<00:05:15.070> can<00:05:15.220> see<00:05:15.370> here<00:05:15.550> I<00:05:15.580> have<00:05:15.700> pre<00:05:15.880> mounted<00:05:16.210> the

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:16.330 
you can see here I have pre mounted the

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:18.810 
you can see here I have pre mounted the
GPS<00:05:16.780> and<00:05:17.110> I've<00:05:17.890> already<00:05:18.190> drilled<00:05:18.400> a<00:05:18.490> hole<00:05:18.520> to

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:18.820 
GPS and I've already drilled a hole to

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:25.010 
GPS and I've already drilled a hole to
install<00:05:19.150> the<00:05:19.270> safety<00:05:19.660> button<00:05:22.860> so<00:05:23.860> there's<00:05:24.070> two

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:25.020 
install the safety button so there's two

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:28.620 
install the safety button so there's two
two<00:05:26.020> connections<00:05:26.560> on<00:05:26.710> the<00:05:26.980> on<00:05:27.190> the<00:05:27.640> GPS<00:05:28.090> one<00:05:28.480> is

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:28.630 
two connections on the on the GPS one is

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:30.900 
two connections on the on the GPS one is
for<00:05:28.870> the<00:05:28.960> compass<00:05:29.380> and<00:05:29.620> one<00:05:30.040> is<00:05:30.190> for<00:05:30.460> the<00:05:30.580> GPS

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:30.910 
for the compass and one is for the GPS

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:35.160 
for the compass and one is for the GPS
itself<00:05:31.410> so<00:05:32.410> the<00:05:32.500> GPS<00:05:32.680> is<00:05:33.100> a<00:05:33.130> six<00:05:33.460> pin<00:05:34.170> we're

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:35.170 
itself so the GPS is a six pin we're

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:38.190 
itself so the GPS is a six pin we're
