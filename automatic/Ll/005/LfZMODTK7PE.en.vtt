think that the way they've changed the

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.969 
think that the way they've changed the
rules<00:01:47.820> that<00:01:48.119> it<00:01:48.270> allows<00:01:48.540> that<00:01:49.290> to<00:01:49.350> happen<00:01:49.500> as

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
rules that it allows that to happen as

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.160 
rules that it allows that to happen as
much<00:01:50.189> anymore<00:01:50.549> they've<00:01:51.360> changed<00:01:51.659> the<00:01:51.930> rules

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
much anymore they've changed the rules

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.069 
much anymore they've changed the rules
to<00:01:52.409> a<00:01:52.439> point<00:01:52.770> where<00:01:53.299> why<00:01:54.299> why<00:01:54.720> should<00:01:54.960> they

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
to a point where why why should they

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:56.389 
to a point where why why should they
have<00:01:55.229> a<00:01:55.290> guy<00:01:55.500> to<00:01:55.530> fight<00:01:55.920> out<00:01:56.070> there<00:01:56.100> they
