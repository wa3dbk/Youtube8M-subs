00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:04.049
 good to all and welcome friends 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:05.519
 well we continue with the map of origin and 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:08.069
 Today I'm going to show you how to get 

00:00:05.519 --> 00:00:09.330
 all the elemental staffs and good 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:13.140
 as you know there are four purple yellow 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.610
 blue and red and good in the previous video 

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:17.160
 I told you how to get the purple 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.900
 last piece the purple here I will put it 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.490
 all together because you see it good 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:24.180
 let's start the first one is yellow the 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.619
 yellow is a bit a bit long since 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.940
 you have to enter inside the robots 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.190
 the three robots that there is the one of the 

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:30.900
 left right and the middle and good 

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:32.489
 you just have to put yourself in one of the 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.829
 holes where the foot that falls 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:37.350
 puts around red red lights 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.059
 they start blinking and when you lift the 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.280
 standing at the moment you are going to give the 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.690
 stomp where you are shooting have 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.510
 to be the lights down in arrivals 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.250
 insured because if there are not 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.710
 will crush us will open the floodgate of your 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:53.070
 foot and good if they are in arrivals shoots 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:56.400
 jce and it will open it will open a round on 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:59.340
 your foot and we have to try to fall in 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:01.530
 the pisen and ye are there in that 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.530
 round and then you'll be up and 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.750
 Well, how are you going to see, take the 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.540
 pieces and the yellow ones the yellow ones 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.280
 yellow cane are all in the in the 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:15.270
 robots in the three robots there you have the 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:18.750
 three pieces from the brain to the center 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.790
 of the yellow cane and the disc is usually 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.970
 be the discs are usually within the 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:28.380
 bunker that is usually in the blue forgiveness 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:31.710
 in the church is red or outside in the 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:34.020
 generator number 6 or the lilac that can 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.250
 be next to titan that good and I'll do 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.950
 a video to tell us where are the 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.220
 discs each all sites 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.880
 that there is good all some 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:45.310
 and the last one was him 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:48.670
 the purple that the lila was 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:51.820
 it was in just for sale and the yellow 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:55.090
 is usually on or next to the 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:58.539
 church also or on top of 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:00.880
 where is samantha and good the next 

00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:03.039
 cane is the purple in the purple what 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.299
 you have to take the tank and in the 

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:06.909
 different places where you are going to see 

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:09.190
 we have to jump over to put them in the 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:10.959
 sharp but there are people who told me that 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:12.910
 if it gets on the edge it goes backwards or 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:16.269
 be as the tank progresses 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:17.980
 He goes back on and it is because there are two 

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:19.239
 lights on the sides to the right of the 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.500
 left you have to climb is just 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:22.510
 over those lights and then we 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:24.340
 we will move and you have to jump to the 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:26.769
 different sites that there are in the 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:28.330
 tank travel and good jumps and if 

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:30.519
 take the piece and you can get another 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:32.620
 normal time that I do not think you can 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:34.420
 go up to the tank again since it is that 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:36.819
 as advancing and you stay that all 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:38.829
 the second ones because you do not get the 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:40.780
 next will be blue good as I've already 

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:42.460
 said the purple disc is usually in 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:45.190
 middle of the map 

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:47.770
 are the sand in the mud where is 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:50.380
 right next to titan the fifth and 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:52.510
 fourth generator sorry the next 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:55.080
 cane is the blue the blue you can 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:57.120
 get the pieces digging 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:59.960
 when it comes to you when you take the word and 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:03.690
 you get a little mountain that there are fossils or 

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:05.730
 there are corpses there are bones and a lot of 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:08.150
 sand, you can find the pieces 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:11.750
 there or killing the 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:14.930
 the big zombie comes to round 7 comes 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:16.940
 one and every time there is a letter to 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:20.390
 catch the stone 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:21.830
 When you two come, I think it's 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:23.450
 selling big and good you can 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:25.340
 get the piece in the area that is the 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:28.610
 red you can find the pieces 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:32.500
 digging killing the new zombie or if 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:35.210
 you look up and one every few rounds 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:37.730
 it comes out like a yellow plane 

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:39.860
 and when he shoots jce you will see what 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:42.230
 good you will have seen throughout the video 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:43.670
 that will come out just as always 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:45.530
 falls on the same side when he knocks it down 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:48.200
 if the pgje falls one of the pieces of the 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:51.860
 red and well you can also get the 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:54.050
 piece killing the big bug to the fomit 

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:55.790
 I know it's when he kills him is when 

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:58.670
 explode you can use in the piece inside 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:59.900
 of him and once it has been everything you already know 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:01.970
 that you can get the stones 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:03.980
 going to letters that is when you have the 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:05.450
 disco and the drama forum and good the only 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:07.550
 what you have to look for is the poster that 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:09.170
 there are next to the doors and good in 

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:12.110
 the doors you can find where is 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:14.540
 each one of the posters the best 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:17.989
 is to put firewind that good fire of 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:19.700
 wind you just have to look at the side of 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:21.080
 the doors between the entrances that 

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:23.650
 you have to go down and where you place the 

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:25.690
 gramophone with color disc 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:27.940
 the place where the columns as 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:30.940
 must leave each element name 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:32.590
 that you go for stone and good to place 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:35.770
 that gramophone you take the stone and then 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:37.389
 you go to where is samantha down 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:39.520
 before that you should have placed 

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:41.229
 the gramophone with what the gramophone is 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:43.360
 If you have not put it and it will open 

00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:44.710
 a spiral door that good in one of 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:47.259
 the videos I'll put it in the description 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:49.690

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:56.470
 color that matches that stone 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:58.750
 and the canes that you have there the pieces 

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:00.310
 of the cane and put it in that place and 

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:03.070
