00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.480
 devices 236 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:19.960
 valuable because it is no longer very much 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:19.960
 easy to use 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.010
 reliably 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:34.290
 it is not tested anchor 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:42.690
 for breakdown of winding insulation 

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:44.930
 set position 1 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.180
 turns on 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:48.730
 city 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:51.309
 take the choop 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:52.960
 and under high voltage we check 

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:55.739
 collector 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.739
 having a circle and 

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:03.560
 220 volt voltage 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.690
 at 

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:10.620
 there is no wallpaper and if the mass is just 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:10.620
 here is a light bulb on fire 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.710
 not 

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:27.220
 now this position 2 

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:30.270
 here you can check 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:30.270
 short circuit 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:33.790
 I am like 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:40.300
 arrow deflected 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:43.860
 had to say or color specifically 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.860
 to fill 1 width 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:48.200
 everything 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.200
 now we will find 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:01.210
 Well, does not deviate 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:09.330
 and where is normal on stage you can 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.080
 to adjust 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.080
 scale 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.720
 the center of the school was 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.720
 such 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:30.420
 we are easier to check and quickly this 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.420
 plate 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:33.680
 where 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:36.710
 short circuit 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:39.570
 news 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.780
 magnetite 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:11.590
 something else I know more
