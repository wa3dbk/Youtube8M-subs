00:00:02.529 --> 00:00:05.789
 Toshiba at CEATEC JAPAN 2010 

00:00:05.789 --> 00:00:09.060
 Without special glasses scheduled to be released from the end of December 

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:12.120
 LCD television that can watch 3D images 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.930
 "Glassless 3D Regza GL1 Series" 

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:16.599
 We exhibited 2 models 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.009
 It is personal size that we commercialized this time 

00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:25.609
 It is 20V type "20GL1" and 12V type "12GL1" 

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:27.669
 This LCD TV is natural and easy to see 

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:29.859
 For watching 3D images 

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:32.890
 Integral imaging method is adopted 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:35.650
 Position and angle differ according to the viewing position 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:39.890
 You can project multiple videos at the same time 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:41.500
 This allows the viewer to 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.280
 Different pictures for each eye 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.080
 It will be caught, even if there is no special glasses 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:49.390
 It can be recognized as a 3D image 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.560
 There are two key technologies 

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:55.810
 One is 3D panel technology 

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:57.780
 Another is image processing 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.829
 Become an engine 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:01.990
 About 3D panel technology 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.439
 To be glassless 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.209
 Created a customized panel for 3D 

00:01:08.209 --> 00:01:11.810
 This is the arrangement of pixels or the shape of pixels 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:13.619
 This is dedicated to 3D 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:18.179
 This gives the very high definition of the naked eye 

00:01:18.179 --> 00:01:21.300
 Now you can get stereoscopic images 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:23.709
 One more image processing engine 

00:01:23.709 --> 00:01:25.629
 For example, if it is our method 

00:01:25.629 --> 00:01:28.110
 I need an image from 9 directions 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.000
 Create an image in nine directions from two images 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.059
 We have established an algorithm that is a conversion technology 

00:01:36.059 --> 00:01:38.800
 Using this, for example, with Cell's Broadband Engine 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:42.049
 You can generate images in real time 

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:45.130
 The price is around 120,000 yen for 12-inch type 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:49.249
 The 20-inch type is around 240,000 yen 

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:51.499
 In addition to this 56-inch large type 

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:53.950
 Reference exhibit 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.420
 The base panel is similar to 4K and 2K 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.459
 As 3D resolution with pixel count 

00:01:59.459 --> 00:02:01.800
 It is a high-definition class 

00:02:02.349 --> 00:02:03.670
 For large ones 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:08.030
 We still need to be technically packed 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:12.000
 Then cost or market needs 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.120
 Plans for commercialization 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.510
 I think it will be established in the future 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.860
 Furthermore, the glassless 3D PC was also exhibited for reference 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:29.000
 This PC is equipped with partial 3D display technology 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.700
 The 2D area and the 3D area coexist in the screen 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.480
 This technology only in the window you specify 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.030
 Change the characteristics to the lens function required for 3D display 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:45.590
 Electrically controlling the ON / OFF
