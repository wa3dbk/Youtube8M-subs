00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:07.330
 CÃ©line Faye I hope you are well 

00:00:05.109 --> 00:00:09.519
 today I am finally making you the 

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:12.880
 review of my favorite of autumn 

00:00:09.519 --> 00:00:17.500
 at nagl who raise bb cream so the 

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:18.609
 bb cream of the wing like annabelle and 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:20.249
 marseilles are one and the same 

00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:24.099
 company I'd like to do and a lot 

00:00:20.249 --> 00:00:26.970
 so at the cream of Marseille bb I you 

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:29.769
 had made a video on this lot ago 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:32.320
 some time already that he had released 

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:34.720
 I fall in love completely 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:36.940
 with this product there then for what is 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:38.590
 16 annabelle it's the same thing I 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:39.670
 I really fell in love with this 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:41.980
 product there that's what I think 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:44.289
 Moreover, at the moment, it gives a 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:47.530
 dyed that yes uniform 

00:00:44.289 --> 00:00:48.969
 yes very bright 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:51.760
 then it's something that is very 

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:53.699
 very natural so we see through to 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:57.309
 through the fountain the cpo like no 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:01:01.059
 as mask consume what they we 

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:02.829
 promise of hunger so sublime chilli 

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:04.330
 adaptive for a perfect chord 1 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:06.100
 billion the complexion like the 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:08.230
 imperfections then ask maybe 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:11.440
 this excavation actually that by throwing 

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:14.470
 in the sense that it's more I would like 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:18.940
 a little younger than my skin I 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:22.570
 shows here so for sure it will 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:25.270
 can younger then it fits 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:30.850
 perfectly to montain I am 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:33.010
 really not disappointed on that I take 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:35.350
 no talent it's really we did it 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:38.440
 since just to make another 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:40.690
 color of skin a balance tobacco is 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:44.560
 sure it stays a foundation when 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:46.750
 even so yes in the intersections 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.280
 actually I 'm often like 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:49.900
 I do not have time to 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.640
 put a cache something that's it 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:53.140
 that I use for my dark circles 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:56.170
 I still have dark circles that are 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:58.780
 quite pronounced so yes it erases them 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:01.330
 imperfections illuminates the complexion of a 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:02.140
 instant radio burst actually I 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:05.340
 find that it gives 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:07.810
 yes it gives I give it a shine and 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.959
 it 's something very bright 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:12.610
 so yes actually 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:15.069
 when I managed to reduce the appearance 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:18.220
 departure control shine tonight 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:19.480
 that -16 March 2 she had already done 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.130
 a lot of work for the pines 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:24.670
 I was afraid of beams and that you are 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:27.280
 here and then down since I'm using is 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:29.680
 Maxell's I had to paint them for 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:32.110
 a lot less goals - dilate and then 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:34.950
 with this one it's the same thing 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:36.970
 content finally and then I always 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:40.000
 as long as I can remember 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:41.860
 always had deposit here and then I have 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.780
 I have more since I use that of Marcel 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:45.280
 then it's the same thing too 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:49.000
 annabelle that we take this goal like that 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:51.069
 so yes that's the nature of the appearance 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.790
 defense in terms of controlling 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:53.590
 brilliance 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:56.470
 again like for those of 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:58.480
 marcel g paul i have dry skin and 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:01.930
 so shine is not a problem 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:07.720
 for me so that I can not tell you 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:10.180
 but it adapts long moisturizing effect 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:13.870
 time actually young in time 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:15.670
 in me except that I'm still my 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:17.030
 idol in time because as I do not 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:20.180
 thought ch 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:21.620
 it's a little risky before the court 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:25.280
 sorry and so I always use 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:28.180
 world of tave but yes I find that 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:31.790
 still an effect of slashing 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:37.130
 protects against uvb rays so this 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:39.890
 which is listed a drop of 15.1 sphp 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:44.780
 a few in France have done May 2 short 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:46.220
 there have been discussions, but yes it is 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:47.870
 that's what's very interesting 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:49.610
 for me because that's what 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:52.459
 worries me in the victory of marseille 

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:53.780
 and then I thought they were for this 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:56.269
 to make three annabelle rooms it's not 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:59.030
 necessarily a concern of 

00:03:56.269 --> 00:04:01.870
 a lot of people to use I speak 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:05.720
 really mainstream than pleasure 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:07.370
 a cream his rank for ages so I 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:10.400
 I'm glad he issued anyway 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:12.260
 in what makes me that is the one 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:15.050
 that I use now instead of 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:16.669
 the one is marcel's in terms of 

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:18.709
 difference between the two I would tell you 

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:21.530
 that first jersey the price those of 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:25.760
 mersen this detail around 20.12 I 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:29.630
 then believe the news with the sdf 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:32.150
 20 is the new marcel around 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:35.000
 of 25 I thought to ride it a little bit 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:39.410
 that of annabelle and toto than 15 so 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.789
 it's super interesting for that no 

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:42.169
 difference that I could tell you 

00:04:40.789 --> 00:04:43.729
 this is a science that I like a little 

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:46.100
 less but maybe that's why 

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:49.880
 the price the lowest prices 

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:52.789
 this is the tip so it's really 

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:55.010
 just in numbers like that then good on 

00:04:52.789 --> 00:04:57.350
 felt that it is not very beautiful for sale 

00:04:55.010 --> 00:05:00.140
 because there are some everywhere more 

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:00.590
 yet I'm careful I that of 

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:02.780
 versailles 

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:06.250
 she wants to be a pump tip like 

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:09.530
 which is frankly all interesting 

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:10.880
 I feel like a father of this 

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:12.860
 young way it really needs to kind 

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:15.030
 is a big amount when it was a 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:17.460
 pump and a half pretty much I'm silent 

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:20.220
 no I can not finally control the 

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:23.130
 quantity that I'm applying because 

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:24.930
 I take it out on my hand before then 

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:26.430
 too much it's not super interesting like 

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:28.440
 After a good but that's not it will 

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:30.300
 stop me from buying another one 

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:33.330
 difference also a little bit less of 

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:34.920
 produce 40 minutes in that compared to 

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:37.020
 those of March there were forty five 

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:40.230
 thousand liters which is the same thing for 

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:42.660
 the greens so that if there is a little 

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:44.550
 minus another difference that I 

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:46.440
 could you say that maybe I have 

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:49.020
 the impression that this one is a little 

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:51.030
 more of the tent than that of marseille 

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:53.340
 I do not know if I am right but me 

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:55.530
 that's the effect it gives and I like 

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:57.300
 a lot better coverage of that I 

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:59.910
 do not know the spice it gives a lot 

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:03.150
 better my skin I feel like I have 

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:07.440
 the complexion of more brightened bremen 

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:10.650
 so that's why I'm the one 

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:11.910
 where I am now I hope I 

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:13.860
 will introduce you to the new 

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:16.350
 product then I hope you liked it 

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:18.450
 so this is questions from 

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:20.160
 comments can always write me a 

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:24.920
 good I answer you it's safe and certain 

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:24.920
 and then we will soon go to the wrong girls
