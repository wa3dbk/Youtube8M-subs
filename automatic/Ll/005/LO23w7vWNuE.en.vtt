00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:49.140 
computer usually it will depend on games
by<00:01:46.570> like<00:01:46.810> Zampa<00:01:47.530> for<00:01:47.710> Halo<00:01:47.920> 1<00:01:48.070> but<00:01:48.280> like<00:01:48.460> if<00:01:48.640> it

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:49.150 
by like Zampa for Halo 1 but like if it

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:50.670 
by like Zampa for Halo 1 but like if it
was<00:01:49.270> put<00:01:49.540> on<00:01:49.630> to<00:01:49.810> Steam<00:01:50.050> or<00:01:50.260> if<00:01:50.380> it's<00:01:50.500> already

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:50.680 
was put on to Steam or if it's already

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:52.140 
was put on to Steam or if it's already
Steam<00:01:51.070> you<00:01:51.160> don't<00:01:51.310> have<00:01:51.400> to<00:01:51.520> worry<00:01:51.700> about<00:01:51.820> that

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:52.150 
Steam you don't have to worry about that

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:53.610 
Steam you don't have to worry about that
and<00:01:52.330> one<00:01:52.510> of<00:01:52.600> the<00:01:52.660> examples<00:01:53.110> for<00:01:53.290> that<00:01:53.350> would

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:53.620 
and one of the examples for that would

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:57.120 
and one of the examples for that would
be<00:01:53.740> grand<00:01:53.980> theft<00:01:54.160> auto<00:01:54.370> 4<00:01:54.760> and<00:01:55.090> so<00:01:56.010> you<00:01:57.010> know

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.130 
be grand theft auto 4 and so you know

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:01.290 
be grand theft auto 4 and so you know
the<00:01:57.880> big<00:01:58.120> developers<00:01:58.720> like<00:01:59.140> Capcom<00:01:59.680> Sega<00:02:00.300> you

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:01.300 
the big developers like Capcom Sega you

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:03.930 
the big developers like Capcom Sega you
know<00:02:01.450> the<00:02:02.260> producers<00:02:02.710> as<00:02:02.860> well<00:02:02.890> Microsoft<00:02:03.730> and

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:03.940 
know the producers as well Microsoft and

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:05.430 
know the producers as well Microsoft and
these<00:02:04.180> other<00:02:04.390> developers<00:02:04.900> as<00:02:05.050> well<00:02:05.230> are

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:05.440 
these other developers as well are

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.560 
these other developers as well are
finding<00:02:06.100> ways<00:02:06.250> to<00:02:06.310> take<00:02:06.700> care<00:02:06.730> of<00:02:07.090> their<00:02:07.300> big

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:07.570 
finding ways to take care of their big

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:09.210 
finding ways to take care of their big
games<00:02:07.840> but<00:02:08.110> like<00:02:08.259> the<00:02:08.379> little<00:02:08.560> games<00:02:08.860> that

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:09.220 
games but like the little games that

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.880 
games but like the little games that

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
the games that we got to be concerned

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:15.690 
the games that we got to be concerned
about

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.790 
about
so<00:02:16.689> anyways<00:02:17.170> thankfully<00:02:17.859> a<00:02:17.890> lot<00:02:18.010> of<00:02:18.249> developer

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:18.800 
so anyways thankfully a lot of developer

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.400 
so anyways thankfully a lot of developer
or<00:02:18.860> fixing<00:02:19.490> it<00:02:19.610> in<00:02:19.760> their<00:02:19.910> own<00:02:20.030> way<00:02:21.020> like<00:02:21.320> I

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
or fixing it in their own way like I

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:23.080 
or fixing it in their own way like I
just<00:02:21.440> said<00:02:21.800> so<00:02:22.010> gamers<00:02:22.340> can<00:02:22.550> still<00:02:22.910> play

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
just said so gamers can still play

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.260 
just said so gamers can still play
online<00:02:23.540> but<00:02:23.810> Capcom<00:02:24.470> and<00:02:25.030> particular<00:02:26.030> is

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:26.270 
online but Capcom and particular is

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:27.790 
online but Capcom and particular is
actually<00:02:26.750> finding<00:02:27.080> solutions<00:02:27.500> for<00:02:27.560> their

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:27.800 
actually finding solutions for their

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.380 
actually finding solutions for their
games<00:02:28.070> that<00:02:28.310> were<00:02:28.430> supported<00:02:28.850> by<00:02:28.880> games<00:02:29.180> by

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
games that were supported by games by

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:31.990 
games that were supported by games by
that<00:02:29.630> is<00:02:29.780> confirmed<00:02:30.320> so<00:02:30.890> if<00:02:31.160> you're<00:02:31.700> plan<00:02:31.880> to

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
that is confirmed so if you're plan to

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.370 
that is confirmed so if you're plan to
Capcom<00:02:32.330> game<00:02:32.510> don't<00:02:32.720> worry<00:02:32.870> about<00:02:32.960> it<00:02:33.200> one

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:33.380 
Capcom game don't worry about it one

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:35.320 
Capcom game don't worry about it one
thing<00:02:33.530> I<00:02:33.710> would<00:02:33.830> like<00:02:33.950> to<00:02:34.010> add<00:02:34.250> though<00:02:34.580> is<00:02:34.790> that

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.330 
thing I would like to add though is that

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:38.470 
thing I would like to add though is that
perhaps<00:02:35.540> with<00:02:36.140> games<00:02:36.380> Wi-Fi<00:02:36.850> finally<00:02:37.850> fading

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
perhaps with games Wi-Fi finally fading

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.830 
perhaps with games Wi-Fi finally fading
out<00:02:38.630> it<00:02:39.010> kind<00:02:40.010> of<00:02:40.130> will<00:02:40.730> give<00:02:40.970> opportunity<00:02:41.600> to

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
out it kind of will give opportunity to

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.720 
out it kind of will give opportunity to
franchise<00:02:42.380> owners<00:02:42.860> and<00:02:43.130> developers<00:02:43.250> to

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730 
franchise owners and developers to

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.930 
franchise owners and developers to
release<00:02:44.360> a<00:02:44.570> steam<00:02:44.870> version<00:02:45.260> or<00:02:45.470> to<00:02:45.830> port<00:02:46.580> it<00:02:46.700> to

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 
release a steam version or to port it to

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:49.540 
release a steam version or to port it to
a<00:02:46.970> PC<00:02:47.780> if<00:02:48.020> game<00:02:48.470> spy<00:02:48.710> was<00:02:48.890> supporting<00:02:49.280> a<00:02:49.340> game

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:49.550 
a PC if game spy was supporting a game

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:52.540 
a PC if game spy was supporting a game
that<00:02:49.820> wasn't<00:02:50.470> already<00:02:51.470> on<00:02:51.830> PC<00:02:52.190> that<00:02:52.370> they<00:02:52.490> were

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:52.550 
that wasn't already on PC that they were

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:55.480 
that wasn't already on PC that they were
supporting<00:02:53.060> um<00:02:53.300> I<00:02:53.830> believe<00:02:54.830> you<00:02:55.220> know<00:02:55.310> for

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:55.490 
supporting um I believe you know for

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:57.130 
supporting um I believe you know for
consoles<00:02:55.970> or<00:02:56.150> mobile<00:02:56.300> devices<00:02:56.630> that<00:02:56.960> maybe

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:57.140 
consoles or mobile devices that maybe

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:59.140 
consoles or mobile devices that maybe
this<00:02:57.650> will<00:02:57.830> give<00:02:57.980> an<00:02:58.100> opportunity<00:02:58.190> for<00:02:58.700> steam

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 
this will give an opportunity for steam

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:02.440 
this will give an opportunity for steam
to<00:02:59.360> grow<00:02:59.570> with<00:02:59.840> more<00:03:00.080> games<00:03:00.380> and<00:03:01.060> one<00:03:02.060> one

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450 
to grow with more games and one one

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:03.550 
to grow with more games and one one
