00:00:47.849 --> 00:00:47.859 
instead of using the whole thing to keep

00:00:47.859 --> 00:00:50.270 
instead of using the whole thing to keep
it<00:00:48.039> like<00:00:48.219> when<00:00:48.460> we<00:00:48.550> just<00:00:48.789> could<00:00:49.030> it<00:00:49.210> cut<00:00:49.960> the

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
it like when we just could it cut the

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.759 
it like when we just could it cut the
block<00:00:51.280> off<00:00:51.550> here<00:00:51.850> and<00:00:52.000> just<00:00:52.809> use<00:00:53.019> just<00:00:53.680> the

00:00:53.759 --> 00:00:53.769 
block off here and just use just the

00:00:53.769 --> 00:00:55.950 
block off here and just use just the
bottom<00:00:54.129> half<00:00:54.340> of<00:00:54.550> it<00:00:54.760> and<00:00:55.179> say<00:00:55.300> okay<00:00:55.570> we'll<00:00:55.780> do

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:55.960 
bottom half of it and say okay we'll do

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:00.540 
bottom half of it and say okay we'll do
that<00:00:55.989> so<00:00:56.949> I<00:00:57.250> did<00:00:57.609> that<00:00:57.879> I<00:00:58.120> took<00:00:58.539> a<00:00:58.929> piece<00:00:59.230> of<00:00:59.550> 3m

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:00.550 
that so I did that I took a piece of 3m

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:03.299 
that so I did that I took a piece of 3m
tape<00:01:00.940> and<00:01:01.149> just<00:01:01.629> stuck<00:01:01.929> it<00:01:02.140> to<00:01:02.739> the<00:01:02.890> bottom

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:03.309 
tape and just stuck it to the bottom

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:08.580 
tape and just stuck it to the bottom
here<00:01:03.550> so<00:01:04.199> the<00:01:05.199> guide<00:01:05.640> so<00:01:06.640> it<00:01:06.990> and<00:01:07.990> you<00:01:08.320> know<00:01:08.440> in

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:08.590 
here so the guide so it and you know in

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:10.080 
here so the guide so it and you know in
case<00:01:08.740> it<00:01:08.860> didn't<00:01:09.100> work<00:01:09.220> I<00:01:09.340> can<00:01:09.490> just<00:01:09.700> pull<00:01:09.910> it

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:10.090 
case it didn't work I can just pull it

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:14.240 
case it didn't work I can just pull it
off<00:01:10.210> instead<00:01:10.510> of<00:01:10.660> using<00:01:10.780> CA<00:01:11.080> glue<00:01:11.940> so<00:01:12.940> also<00:01:13.540> I

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
off instead of using CA glue so also I

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.730 
off instead of using CA glue so also I
find<00:01:15.250> out<00:01:15.520> what<00:01:16.240> oh<00:01:16.290> let<00:01:17.290> me<00:01:17.380> tell<00:01:17.560> you<00:01:17.619> why<00:01:17.710> I

for<00:01:19.270> one<00:01:19.450> it<00:01:19.810> called<00:01:20.380> if<00:01:20.770> this<00:01:21.250> was<00:01:21.460> by<00:01:21.640> itself

00:01:21.929 --> 00:01:21.939 
for one it called if this was by itself

00:01:23.999 --> 00:01:24.009 
without this guide here it will have a

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:25.560 
without this guide here it will have a
flex<00:01:24.579> right<00:01:25.000> in<00:01:25.210> here

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:25.570 
flex right in here

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:28.530

did was pop the linkage right back out

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:11.670 
did was pop the linkage right back out
and<00:02:08.860> open<00:02:09.700> it<00:02:09.759> up<00:02:09.910> just<00:02:10.270> a<00:02:10.570> little<00:02:10.600> bit<00:02:10.960> with

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
and open it up just a little bit with

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.530 
and open it up just a little bit with
the<00:02:11.800> razor<00:02:12.040> blade<00:02:12.400> typical<00:02:12.970> razor<00:02:13.150> blade<00:02:13.390> and

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
the razor blade typical razor blade and

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.370 
the razor blade typical razor blade and
done<00:02:14.050> the<00:02:14.170> same<00:02:14.200> thing<00:02:14.800> here

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
done the same thing here

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:20.180 
done the same thing here
so<00:02:17.630> start<00:02:18.630> the<00:02:18.690> flight<00:02:18.960> spool<00:02:19.620> it<00:02:19.770> up<00:02:19.890> and<00:02:20.070> the

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
so start the flight spool it up and the

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.580 
so start the flight spool it up and the
vibrations<00:02:20.820> was<00:02:21.090> gone<00:02:21.330> so<00:02:21.630> what<00:02:22.170> we<00:02:22.320> going<00:02:22.500> to

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
vibrations was gone so what we going to

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.160 
vibrations was gone so what we going to
do<00:02:22.970> we<00:02:23.970> go<00:02:24.120> on<00:02:24.150> the<00:02:24.300> flight<00:02:24.540> and<00:02:24.720> I<00:02:24.900> show<00:02:25.140> you

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
do we go on the flight and I show you

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.220 
do we go on the flight and I show you
that<00:02:25.380> the<00:02:25.470> vibration<00:02:26.100> is<00:02:26.220> gone<00:02:26.450> and<00:02:27.450> it<00:02:27.930> seems

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
that the vibration is gone and it seems

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:34.910 
that the vibration is gone and it seems
to<00:02:28.320> work<00:02:28.560> out<00:02:30.440> so<00:02:32.330> my<00:02:33.330> boy<00:02:33.540> on<00:02:33.840> pull<00:02:34.170> redneck<00:02:34.710> on

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
to work out so my boy on pull redneck on

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.800 
to work out so my boy on pull redneck on
held<00:02:35.190> efreet<00:02:35.460> saying<00:02:35.730> he's<00:02:36.030> had<00:02:36.300> some<00:02:36.510> little

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.060 
5 on the gyro game so this right here

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:57.330 
5 on the gyro game so this right here
got<00:02:51.060> some<00:02:51.240> plane

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:02.640 

let's<00:02:57.910> do<00:03:00.240> check<00:03:01.240> my<00:03:01.390> surfaces<00:03:01.870> before<00:03:02.080> taking

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
let's do check my surfaces before taking

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:09.059 
let's do check my surfaces before taking
off<00:03:04.709> this<00:03:05.709> fly

00:03:09.059 --> 00:03:09.069 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:15.110 

you<00:03:09.730> notice<00:03:10.180> no<00:03:11.019> vibration

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:19.580 

ah<00:03:15.260> spooler

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:04:46.820 

tailhold<00:03:20.190> and<00:03:20.640> good<00:03:20.790> no<00:03:21.150> wobbles

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:46.830 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:49.420 

all<00:04:47.580> right<00:04:47.789> but<00:04:48.060> I<00:04:48.210> just<00:04:48.479> want<00:04:48.690> to<00:04:48.780> show<00:04:48.960> that
