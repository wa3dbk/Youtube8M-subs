00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
that was because if your personality is

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.119 
that was because if your personality is
being<00:00:45.840> so<00:00:45.960> similar<00:00:46.320> or<00:00:46.469> because<00:00:46.680> your<00:00:46.770> genre

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
being so similar or because your genre

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:48.590 
being so similar or because your genre
is<00:00:47.309> were<00:00:47.460> so<00:00:47.670> different<00:00:47.940> and<00:00:48.239> you<00:00:48.329> still

is were so different and you still

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.260 
is were so different and you still
manage<00:00:48.870> to<00:00:48.899> mesh<00:00:49.170> I<00:00:49.820> probably<00:00:50.820> a<00:00:51.000> little<00:00:51.090> bit

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
manage to mesh I probably a little bit

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.150 
manage to mesh I probably a little bit
of<00:00:51.390> both<00:00:51.510> but<00:00:51.539> definitely<00:00:52.320> because<00:00:52.590> I<00:00:52.860> feel

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.049 
of both but definitely because I feel
like<00:00:53.190> we<00:00:53.370> do<00:00:53.520> have<00:00:53.550> very<00:00:53.789> similar

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
personality so I do think that plays a

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:19.820 
personality so I do think that plays a
really<00:02:18.360> big<00:02:18.630> part<00:02:18.810> especially<00:02:19.110> during<00:02:19.560> the

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
really big part especially during the

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.980 
really big part especially during the
actual<00:02:20.130> show<00:02:20.400> because<00:02:20.880> people<00:02:21.750> are<00:02:21.840> like

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 
actual show because people are like

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:23.810 
actual show because people are like
deciding<00:02:22.470> who<00:02:22.590> their<00:02:22.770> favorite<00:02:22.890> dancers<00:02:23.460> and

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:23.820 
deciding who their favorite dancers and

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:24.950 
deciding who their favorite dancers and
that's<00:02:24.120> all<00:02:24.300> going<00:02:24.390> to<00:02:24.480> be<00:02:24.540> based<00:02:24.750> on

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:24.960 
that's all going to be based on

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:27.110 
that's all going to be based on
obviously<00:02:25.770> talent<00:02:26.160> everything<00:02:26.490> but<00:02:26.700> also<00:02:26.850> the

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
obviously talent everything but also the

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.520 
obviously talent everything but also the
connection<00:02:27.510> that<00:02:27.540> they<00:02:27.750> can<00:02:27.990> get<00:02:28.170> just<00:02:28.350> from

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
connection that they can get just from

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.350 
connection that they can get just from
like<00:02:28.710> watching<00:02:29.070> a<00:02:29.130> TV<00:02:29.280> screen<00:02:29.460> and<00:02:29.970> it's<00:02:30.240> so

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
like watching a TV screen and it's so

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:31.730 
like watching a TV screen and it's so
much<00:02:30.510> different<00:02:30.660> when<00:02:30.930> you're<00:02:31.080> like<00:02:31.170> actually

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:31.740 
much different when you're like actually

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:33.350 
much different when you're like actually
watching<00:02:32.100> it<00:02:32.220> on<00:02:32.310> the<00:02:32.430> tour<00:02:32.670> because<00:02:32.880> it's<00:02:33.120> in

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
watching it on the tour because it's in

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.330 
watching it on the tour because it's in
person<00:02:33.870> but<00:02:34.320> yeah<00:02:34.860> throughout<00:02:35.100> the<00:02:35.190> show<00:02:35.310> I

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
person but yeah throughout the show I

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:36.680 
person but yeah throughout the show I
think<00:02:35.580> that<00:02:35.730> played<00:02:35.940> a<00:02:35.970> really<00:02:36.210> important

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
think that played a really important

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.960 
think that played a really important
role<00:02:37.040> Ricky<00:02:38.040> I<00:02:38.160> know<00:02:38.250> I'm<00:02:38.370> really<00:02:38.490> hammering

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:50.420 
answer would be contemporary and tap

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:53.470 
answer would be contemporary and tap
what<00:05:50.780> would<00:05:51.050> that<00:05:51.170> be<00:05:51.230> correct<00:05:51.620> um<00:05:52.490> I<00:05:53.120> mean

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:53.480 
what would that be correct um I mean

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:55.600 
what would that be correct um I mean
there<00:05:53.660> was<00:05:53.810> a<00:05:53.840> lot<00:05:54.020> of<00:05:54.230> different<00:05:54.650> styles

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:55.610 
there was a lot of different styles

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:57.760 
there was a lot of different styles
throughout<00:05:55.970> the<00:05:56.090> top<00:05:56.240> 20<00:05:56.570> but<00:05:56.810> in<00:05:57.230> the<00:05:57.620> end

00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:57.770 
throughout the top 20 but in the end

00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:59.620 
throughout the top 20 but in the end
like<00:05:58.100> with<00:05:58.400> the<00:05:58.520> finale<00:05:58.880> there<00:05:59.150> was<00:05:59.270> so<00:05:59.480> much

00:05:59.620 --> 00:05:59.630 
like with the finale there was so much

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:02.050 
like with the finale there was so much
more<00:05:59.740> tap<00:06:00.740> than<00:06:01.070> there<00:06:01.190> ever<00:06:01.220> has<00:06:01.430> been<00:06:01.550> so<00:06:02.030> I

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:02.060 
more tap than there ever has been so I

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:03.700 
more tap than there ever has been so I
do<00:06:02.180> think<00:06:02.540> the<00:06:02.690> tap<00:06:02.900> was<00:06:03.080> incorporated<00:06:03.650> in

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:03.710 
do think the tap was incorporated in

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:05.290 
do think the tap was incorporated in
this<00:06:03.830> season<00:06:04.130> and<00:06:04.250> then<00:06:04.370> there<00:06:04.880> was<00:06:05.000> a<00:06:05.060> lot<00:06:05.270> of

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:05.300 
this season and then there was a lot of

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:06.970 
this season and then there was a lot of
contemporary<00:06:05.960> dancers<00:06:06.290> to<00:06:06.560> start<00:06:06.800> out<00:06:06.950> with

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:06.980 
contemporary dancers to start out with

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:08.880 
contemporary dancers to start out with
right<00:06:07.580> there<00:06:07.910> was<00:06:08.000> a<00:06:08.030> lot<00:06:08.180> I<00:06:08.210> was<00:06:08.390> like<00:06:08.480> yeah

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:08.890 
right there was a lot I was like yeah

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:12.630 
right there was a lot I was like yeah
but<00:06:09.890> this<00:06:10.100> night<00:06:10.910> no<00:06:11.270> no<00:06:11.420> eight<00:06:11.750> or<00:06:11.870> seven<00:06:11.990> yeah

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:12.640 
but this night no no eight or seven yeah

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:15.820 
but this night no no eight or seven yeah
but<00:06:13.640> that's<00:06:13.790> a<00:06:13.850> lot<00:06:14.030> for<00:06:14.060> 20<00:06:14.540> it<00:06:14.690> is<00:06:14.750> yeah<00:06:15.290> so<00:06:15.800> I

guess there was a lot of a good

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:18.850 
guess there was a lot of a good
contemporary<00:06:18.020> pieces<00:06:18.260> and<00:06:18.500> there<00:06:18.590> was<00:06:18.680> less<00:06:18.830> a

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:18.860 
contemporary pieces and there was less a

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:21.280 
contemporary pieces and there was less a
