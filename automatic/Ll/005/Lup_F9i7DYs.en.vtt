00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.060
 Mr. Chairman a we have one 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:03.899
 good match both of 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:05.490
 beringen 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:08.010
 like van ft antwerpen but I have the 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.780
 impression that you are absolutely not satisfied we 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.370
 I am certainly not satisfied 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.670
 why shall i say we lose any 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:17.100
 we quietly points through the last three 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.390
 four minutes and I am very sorry about that 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.510
 I have to admit that the 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.310
 because of the trainers there are mistakes because in 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.939
 July indeed to four five minutes 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.760
 before the end 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:29.160
 yes you stand on one second, then yes to 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.019
 you will be finished in 30 seconds 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.189
 is not the right word but yes it is 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.170
 about an old nature 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.700
 sure family wind was normal today 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.380
 ANTWERP not think I'm definitely 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.850
 but by eating the stupid I will 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.379
 I will say out of the breathe I will 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.260
 say i am not the broad one 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:45.510
 the outcome walking in these players 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.829
 have done all its best I have 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.530
 expected today that we certainly went 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.210
 but because of the mistake of the points 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.000
 all last three four minutes 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.660
 now it's done for me so I can 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.760
 no longer valid 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.829
 I just wanted to say be the president 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.539
 You have to go into surgery any year 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.820
 and certainly against was against tonight 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.930
 rybak and that is how I am not going anymore 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.369
 further 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.260
 because you have a good team ahead of me 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.610
 a certain was we can certainly be 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:12.409
 I'm sure and play play-offs 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:15.689
 fixed but due to the mistake of the management 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:17.400
 together here the pictures of the management and 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.710
 do you mean the coach because I think 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.390
 that the referees today have too little 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.670
 remove manage be crap 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.280
 You never know about it so they are up to now 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.509
 far, we have no problems 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.549
 the referee was certainly not on 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:32.700
 but just i'm with the lead as 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:34.799
 as a coach are not satisfied and everyone is 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.610
 well the his face but today is the 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.259
 full size 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.180
 But then you must now look for one 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:42.860
 new god i think i'm there tonight 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:45.540
 certainly would provide a new coach 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:48.509
 tonight's decision I'll be with the 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.829
 board come together and we will do ours 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.840
 want to draw a conclusion 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:54.030
 Do you already have someone in mind? 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:57.840
 was not on because was certainly tonight 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:59.369
 things it actually sees you wanted 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.380
 really win and you would be too soon 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:03.780
 even before we entered here yes 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.130
 tonight the TV is in there 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.509
 as certainly 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.369
 we have we can against everyone we 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.600
 just like me there i would start from the beginning 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.640
 just 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:16.060
 I stick with it and now she had a role 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:18.580
 so the players the group is enormously huge 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:22.540
 that back together to make sure that panel 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:24.730
 but I see that there are things 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.810
 that there is no knock and that news 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:30.150
 done news for me 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:30.150
 good luck I actually change
