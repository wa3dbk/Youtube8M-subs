00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
um I think just like we were talking

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.060 
um I think just like we were talking
about<00:01:53.369> last<00:01:53.759> week<00:01:54.240> when<00:01:54.450> I<00:01:54.540> said<00:01:54.780> classic<00:01:55.710> sort

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
about last week when I said classic sort

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.190 
about last week when I said classic sort
of<00:01:56.159> square<00:01:56.490> better<00:01:56.850> strap<00:01:57.390> and<00:01:57.899> I<00:01:57.960> talked

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
of square better strap and I talked

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.649 
of square better strap and I talked
about<00:01:58.409> Arkansas<00:01:58.860> going<00:01:59.159> to<00:01:59.250> Ole<00:01:59.430> Miss<00:01:59.670> I<00:02:00.030> think

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
about Arkansas going to Ole Miss I think

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:03.010 
about Arkansas going to Ole Miss I think
this<00:02:00.840> is<00:02:00.899> another<00:02:01.799> great<00:02:01.950> version<00:02:02.369> of<00:02:02.670> that

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.020

this is another great version of that

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:09.890 
think that's a misleading ranking I
think<00:03:08.460> that<00:03:08.580> he<00:03:08.700> makes<00:03:08.910> a<00:03:09.030> lot<00:03:09.180> of<00:03:09.210> really<00:03:09.780> good

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
think that he makes a lot of really good

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.010 
think that he makes a lot of really good
points<00:03:10.320> to<00:03:10.470> counteract<00:03:11.190> the<00:03:11.310> other<00:03:11.400> side<00:03:11.700> I<00:03:12.020> my

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:13.020 
points to counteract the other side I my

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:15.410 
points to counteract the other side I my
feeling<00:03:13.470> is<00:03:13.590> that<00:03:13.650> 10<00:03:14.220> points<00:03:14.670> it's<00:03:14.820> just<00:03:15.180> not

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
feeling is that 10 points it's just not

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.450 
feeling is that 10 points it's just not
enough<00:03:15.750> to<00:03:15.990> take<00:03:16.200> a<00:03:16.230> look<00:03:16.470> at<00:03:16.650> vanderbilt

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:17.460 
enough to take a look at vanderbilt

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:19.430 
enough to take a look at vanderbilt
having<00:03:17.820> a<00:03:17.880> quarterback<00:03:18.420> change<00:03:18.810> and<00:03:19.050> taking<00:03:19.350> a

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
look at what they did earlier in this

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.540 
look at what they did earlier in this
year<00:03:22.110> against<00:03:22.350> teams<00:03:22.620> like<00:03:22.710> South<00:03:23.010> Carolina

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:23.550 
year against teams like South Carolina

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
which aren't beautiful offenses you

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:27.260 
which aren't beautiful offenses you
can't<00:03:26.280> argue<00:03:26.400> with<00:03:26.550> the<00:03:26.670> stats<00:03:26.970> that<00:03:27.150> were

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:27.270 
can't argue with the stats that were

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:29.300 
can't argue with the stats that were

just laid out against against it I just

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.520 
just laid out against against it I just
based<00:03:30.060> on<00:03:30.240> what<00:03:30.420> we<00:03:30.570> see<00:03:30.780> it's<00:03:31.050> not<00:03:31.230> enough

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
based on what we see it's not enough

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:33.260 
based on what we see it's not enough
points<00:03:31.770> you're<00:03:32.010> getting<00:03:32.250> three<00:03:32.700> free<00:03:32.910> points

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:33.270
