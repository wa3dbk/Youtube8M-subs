00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:16.170
 two images for this elaboration 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:18.570
 a portrait is very fast and imaginative 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.369
 it could also be a landscape 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.470
 another photograph is important that yes 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.930
 suited to what we're going to do is 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:28.439
 the image of this blur this 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:32.250
 mouths that like it so much and it turns crazy 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:34.350
 on the net three roads to realize them or 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.380
 directly to the computer if we know 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:40.020
 how to do it or by taking one 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.180
 photography of light points such as 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.420
 could be Christmas lights and 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:48.149
 blurring these light points or 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:53.250
 doing a network search where 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:54.600
 we will find trunks of mouths to use 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.190
 the game is to merge two 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.129
 images to get an effect 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:02.570
 pictorial exploiting what is one 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:04.890
 blur in circles in characteristic is 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:07.110
 applied instead our photography 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:10.200
 then I initially remove this 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:12.990
 image with the tool move I click 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.270
 drag with click and release to 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.619
 upstairs 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:19.229
 probably won't match the 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:22.830
 dimensions with the usual tools of 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:24.900
 modification transforms scale and here too 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.450
 without pressing the shift key or even if 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:30.630
 we form them a little bit and the same 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.759
 it is not serious because then it will go you will see 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.049
 you will not see this image sent by 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.130
 confirm 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.439
 we have our window 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:40.829
 levels to understand what we are doing 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:44.189
 less usual window levels is always 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:45.649
 our window of trust is here 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:48.270
 we're going to combine the two 

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:50.570
 taking advantage of the diffusion methods therefore 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.870
 from in this position 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:55.930
 these photographs are often found with 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:59.890
 black background just because they come 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:03.410
 taken or made in the environment 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:05.540
 obscured by shooting on light points and 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:08.300
 therefore they have this feature of 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:12.860
 black background so it should also be searched in 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:14.630
 Based on our photography is not all 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:16.940
 fusions methods may be fine 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:18.290
 or what I use 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.420
 it's probably not going well on 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:22.790
 another very white photograph 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:25.070
 then if it starts to slide a bit i 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:27.780
 diffusion methods and I will find some 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:30.600
 situations where the thing can be 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:34.740
 combine well and others where not 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:37.170
 is really effective here are those that 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:39.480
 we have seen thus far thus centuries 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.590
 I'm literally passing everyone a bit 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.660
 How many 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:44.970
 here this could already be 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:47.580
 not used this way because 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:50.550
 those too marked blurring effect 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:54.330
 however, look around to see 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:56.700
 what else can come up coming in 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:58.890
 no car bottom so you come back 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:01.920
 back and what works best 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:03.989
 it would seem the subtracts to this level 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:06.630
 optical a blur just to make 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:09.390
 the most pictorial thing to make these 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:12.209
 these circles a little more like stains than 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:14.880
 color then a click with the button 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:16.560
 right converts to an advanced object 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:22.610
 this will allow me to apply a 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:25.610
 blur control blur filter 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:28.440
 dose it by looking literally at what 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:33.000
 how the situation behaves e 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:36.269
 finding the most effective combination 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.250
 for the image I am using 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:40.140
 under 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:42.180
 I confirm initially with this filter 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:43.940
 advanced just applied that 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:46.950
 possibility of being able to resume it 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:49.560
 reapply if in the arrangement of 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:51.630
 these spots of color maybe 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:54.420
 they become intrusive on what they are 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:56.670
 the areas of the important area of ​​the 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:04:02.489
 photography always with the tools of 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:05.600
 change transform scale applied to 

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:09.870
 level of blur, of course 

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:12.030
 we will go to as an advanced object not not 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:14.549
 consider the blur until it has 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:17.340
 given confirmation and then we'll go to maybe 

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:19.919
 to reposition to change the 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:22.019
 dimensions in what I'm doing e 

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:26.250
 than trying to open a little bit of 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:28.650
 more on the face to have less noise 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:31.169
 I try to stop in this way I confirm 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:33.260
 the return is applied 

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:36.740
 blur and 

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:39.350
 maybe the portrait becomes more readable 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:43.690
 underlying as we can also always 

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:46.700
 with modification it turns wheel to 180 degrees 

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:49.280
 evaluate the situation and overturn 

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:52.340
 completely we can also apply 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:55.700
 an adjustment comes back because 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:57.650
 it was better as it was before tonality 

00:04:55.700 --> 00:05:01.130
 then vary those that are 

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:03.320
 initial tones used in this 

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:05.240
 case I have to sterilize the level 

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:07.940
 then a right click 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:11.150
 rasps level application level of 

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:14.840
 saturation shade adjustment a 

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:17.240
 click holding the mouse in this 

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:20.150
 position between one level and another alt 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:22.010
 to the keyboard and click to apply 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:23.030
 this adjustment only at the level 

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:25.280
 below 

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:28.850
 here in the course of the tonality I make i 

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:32.270
 my my tests and I evaluate any 

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:36.370
 other solutions and combinations or ne 

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:39.530
 I try to have more results than 

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:45.020
 over the first I had that I had 

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:47.750
 chosen we can reduce the opacity of del 

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:50.840
 blur level if it is too much 

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:53.720
 intense too strong too marked ed 

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:57.050
 pupil a more delicate aspect more 

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:59.120
 light as we can also activate the 

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:00.980
 background level and apply a white 

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:03.110
 and black this to remove the color 

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:05.840
 original then a ball of 

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:08.870
 adjustment by ticking black and white after 

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:12.740
 having clicked on the level of the 

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:15.200
 fair black and white background I remove the 

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:17.860
 color if momentarily I turn off here 

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:21.650
 I see the image below and in color 

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:23.930
 I can still juggle with the cursors 

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:26.510
 of adjusting my black and white for 

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:30.220
 get something more contrast 

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:33.300
 that can modify or render more 

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:36.870
 captivating my photo 

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:40.550
 and then exploit it as black and white 

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:44.280
 colored by these taking advantage of this 

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:47.460
 this pre coloring of the bowkett dl 

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:51.210
 of the blur I applied to 

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:53.699
 over more time received more time to 

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:55.400
 explain that it can be 

00:06:53.699 --> 00:06:57.210
 fun to find alternative solutions 

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:59.759
 change the colors 

00:06:57.210 --> 00:07:03.479
 originals of our photography and 

00:06:59.759 --> 00:07:07.490
 see how we can reinvent ourselves 

00:07:03.479 --> 00:07:07.490
 things using these colors
