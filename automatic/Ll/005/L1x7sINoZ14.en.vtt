replacing<00:00:05.310> the<00:00:05.490> AC<00:00:05.850> compressor<00:00:06.419> as<00:00:06.990> you<00:00:07.529> see

00:00:07.759 --> 00:00:07.769 
replacing the AC compressor as you see

00:00:07.769 --> 00:00:09.920 
replacing the AC compressor as you see
it's<00:00:07.919> right<00:00:08.160> down<00:00:08.400> here<00:00:08.820> this<00:00:09.420> little<00:00:09.690> guy

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:09.930 
it's right down here this little guy

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:13.130 
it's right down here this little guy
right<00:00:09.990> here<00:00:10.560> and<00:00:10.770> we<00:00:11.370> had<00:00:11.610> a<00:00:11.640> noise<00:00:12.630> in<00:00:13.080> the

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:13.140 
right here and we had a noise in the

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:14.990 
right here and we had a noise in the
compressor<00:00:13.800> it<00:00:13.950> was<00:00:14.070> working<00:00:14.400> fine<00:00:14.610> but<00:00:14.910> it

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
compressor it was working fine but it

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.210 
compressor it was working fine but it
was<00:00:15.120> making<00:00:15.330> a<00:00:15.540> chattering<00:00:16.019> noise<00:00:16.320> every<00:00:17.039> time

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
was making a chattering noise every time

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.109 
was making a chattering noise every time
we<00:00:17.340> engage<00:00:17.700> the<00:00:17.910> AC<00:00:18.090> so<00:00:18.660> basically<00:00:19.789> in<00:00:20.789> order

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
we engage the AC so basically in order

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.750 
we engage the AC so basically in order
to<00:00:21.240> replace<00:00:21.510> the<00:00:21.660> pulley<00:00:22.530> it's<00:00:22.980> just<00:00:23.460> a<00:00:23.580> pain

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
to replace the pulley it's just a pain

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:24.920 
to replace the pulley it's just a pain
in<00:00:23.910> the<00:00:23.940> neck<00:00:24.030> so<00:00:24.449> we're<00:00:24.660> just<00:00:24.690> going<00:00:24.869> to

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
in the neck so we're just going to

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.050 
in the neck so we're just going to
replace<00:00:25.230> the<00:00:25.320> whole<00:00:25.410> compressor<00:00:25.980> and<00:00:26.130> call<00:00:26.910> it

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
replace the whole compressor and call it

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.210 
replace the whole compressor and call it
a<00:00:27.150> day<00:00:27.180> so<00:00:27.960> basically<00:00:28.470> what<00:00:28.710> we're<00:00:28.860> doing<00:00:28.890> is

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
a day so basically what we're doing is

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.920 
a day so basically what we're doing is
we're<00:00:29.369> disconnecting<00:00:30.000> the<00:00:30.090> compressor<00:00:30.660> lines

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:30.930 
we're disconnecting the compressor lines

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:33.160 
we're disconnecting the compressor lines
right<00:00:31.320> now<00:00:31.500> and<00:00:31.859> all<00:00:32.099> that<00:00:32.340> I'll<00:00:32.850> be

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:33.170 
right now and all that I'll be

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:37.700 
right now and all that I'll be
electrical<00:00:34.170> supplies<00:00:35.100> to<00:00:35.520> it<00:00:35.730> and<00:00:36.710> we're

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
electrical supplies to it and we're

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:43.250 
electrical supplies to it and we're
going<00:00:37.800> to<00:00:37.890> evacuate<00:00:38.160> and<00:00:39.170> remove<00:00:42.200> okay<00:00:43.200> so

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
going to evacuate and remove okay so

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.450 
going to evacuate and remove okay so
this<00:00:43.770> is<00:00:43.920> the<00:00:44.070> AC<00:00:44.430> control<00:00:44.880> switch<00:00:45.480> right<00:00:45.750> here

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:46.460 
this is the AC control switch right here

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:49.010 
this is the AC control switch right here
so<00:00:47.460> every<00:00:47.610> time<00:00:47.730> you<00:00:47.850> turn<00:00:48.000> the<00:00:48.030> AC<00:00:48.239> on<00:00:48.480> this

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
so every time you turn the AC on this

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.180 
so every time you turn the AC on this
switch<00:00:49.290> activates<00:00:49.920> the<00:00:50.160> AC<00:00:50.969> unit<00:00:51.570> and<00:00:52.190> makes

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
switch activates the AC unit and makes

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.740 
switch activates the AC unit and makes
our<00:00:53.340> AC<00:00:53.520> run<00:00:53.910> so<00:00:54.180> we're<00:00:54.329> going<00:00:54.420> to<00:00:54.480> pull<00:00:54.719> that

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
our AC run so we're going to pull that

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.069 
our AC run so we're going to pull that
out<00:00:54.930> we're<00:00:55.800> going<00:00:55.890> to<00:00:56.010> disconnect<00:00:56.309> that

00:00:57.069 --> 00:00:57.079 
out we're going to disconnect that

00:00:57.079 --> 00:00:59.630 
out we're going to disconnect that
