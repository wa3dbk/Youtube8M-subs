00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:02.780
 it costs TV 

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:05.130
 before and after commentary 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:06.390
 also every month 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:08.679
 he scored 

00:00:08.679 --> 00:00:11.799
 theme of the month and he is sick 

00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:14.249
 real deventer club 

00:00:14.249 --> 00:00:17.249
 with today 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:20.890
 already paid to 

00:00:22.339 --> 00:00:24.519
 dwm one to share 

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:27.849
 I finally find the pledge with another referee 

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:30.779
 I had expected it 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.230
 can and must keep at the peak in Egypt 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:35.640
 to be able to move as a footballer with this team 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.830
 that is really not normal though 

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:40.830
 such as make 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.400
 Max Westerman choices in the game 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:50.630
 we have now we are still undefeated let me put that first 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:52.880
 it is critical 

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:54.330
 so that we can grow 

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:56.680
 just about the forward 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.830
 years in the fourth class below that none of us want 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:02.840
 and that we just want to write history for this club 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.840
 also with this selection it is a young selection 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.190
 that it is a very good selection that it is 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:11.140
 the best selection 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.230
 playing football all the way 

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:15.910
 that is sometimes fast 

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:19.060
 brought out of our concentration by customer circumstances such as 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:20.440
 referee stood 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:22.730
 it's all about the honor against the entire game 

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:25.110
 instead of the car if we as a collective 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.940
 tip the referee 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:29.060
 say let's start to feel put 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:31.560
 against the illegal the headwind 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.560
 and that breaks then the chief of police 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:39.260
 k inside I'm going two yellow cards for ten minutes 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.390
 first was a stupid yellow card 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:43.030
 every ball by hand 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:44.320
 I shouldn't have done that 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.390
 but I thought there was something further in the back 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:49.250
 mb I'm going by car anyway 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:52.440
 I go red with it and, moreover, my approach to tapas 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:54.670
 he looked back 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:58.200
 only two boys got stuck there, it's now time to do it 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.560
 in the kabbalah in midfield and 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.979
 talk while there is a lot of drinking I am going a lot of pressure I hit the ball and the man 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.150
 maybe so 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:07.939
 he draws a second yellow card 

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:09.589
 who can discuss the about 

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:10.979
 I do not think so 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.979
 I would tell two parties that it is not 

00:02:14.539 --> 00:02:17.539
 ultimately by ourselves anyway 

00:02:21.969 --> 00:02:25.099
 she came in the first half of the euro after two years 

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:28.549
 really very strong organization played football 

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:31.639
 had a lot of trouble to get a grip on it thanks to two quick strikers 

00:02:31.639 --> 00:02:32.349
 a 

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:35.359
 and you may have made a wrong choice in the back 

00:02:35.359 --> 00:02:38.779
 what kind of coverage should apply to them 

00:02:38.779 --> 00:02:41.779
 yes i actually have the second half az 

00:02:43.669 --> 00:02:44.999
 to put it right 

00:02:44.999 --> 00:02:46.919
 inserting a bill 

00:02:46.919 --> 00:02:49.739
 tonight camp was shrink it just wasn't good 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:50.999
 I wasn't in the right position 

00:02:50.999 --> 00:02:54.029
 position not properly occupied if he had the ball 

00:02:54.029 --> 00:02:55.359
 what i have to say is there 

00:02:55.359 --> 00:02:58.359
 that puts adapter 

00:02:58.359 --> 00:03:01.529
 then you see that the boy has a lot of plastic experience in the field 

00:03:02.039 --> 00:03:05.579
 and that we like them for a while on each side so I like the evening in it 

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:06.629
 second team 

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:08.089
 satisfied with it 

00:03:08.089 --> 00:03:11.089
 if you are just about the whole turkey game then i guess i don't 

00:03:12.169 --> 00:03:15.169
 I just keep on creating as little as the team 

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:19.369
 if you look at the opportunities that we have all seen in the past week 

00:03:19.369 --> 00:03:21.469
 in front of the golden gate 

00:03:21.469 --> 00:03:23.599
 there was no counting today 

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:26.709
 but I think the result in one is also more than justified 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:28.709
 therefore not good in the eyes 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:29.889
 two of them 

00:03:29.889 --> 00:03:33.149
 trying to play soccer failed to code again 

00:03:33.149 --> 00:03:35.089
 and the 8 

00:03:35.089 --> 00:03:38.089
 very smart a good moment to be able to score a goal 

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:43.859
 olmert said to me cyanogen from slagharen once 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:47.389
 little is actually known about the team of mine 

00:03:47.389 --> 00:03:50.389
 so the choice to bring in information at the walcheren agency 

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:53.489
 I know it is a physical team 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:56.419
 if there is ap ap stronger in paris 

00:03:56.419 --> 00:03:58.739
 have good strikers strong on the ball 

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:01.239
 well there we will have to take care of that 

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:04.089
 and ultimately we must have a plan of football 

00:04:04.089 --> 00:04:06.449
 as your average age yourself 

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:09.620
 yes of the long range and of the team and the average length of the team 

00:04:09.619 --> 00:04:12.619
 always below the level ever of volkswagen than the opponent 

00:04:13.219 --> 00:04:14.489
 yes then on 

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:16.959
 then you just have to insert the option 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:19.079
 and after the ball go from foot to foot 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:20.749
 and that is what they are good at but we have to stop
