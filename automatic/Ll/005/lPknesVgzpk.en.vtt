stop or impede your your fall to the
ground<00:02:22.360> there<00:02:23.360> is<00:02:23.390> two<00:02:23.660> different<00:02:23.810> settings

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:24.350 
ground there is two different settings

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:27.550 
ground there is two different settings
that<00:02:25.280> my<00:02:25.430> first<00:02:25.670> setting<00:02:26.060> is<00:02:26.480> in<00:02:27.019> the<00:02:27.140> red<00:02:27.319> here

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
that my first setting is in the red here

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.410 
that my first setting is in the red here
and<00:02:27.769> basically<00:02:28.340> what<00:02:28.670> that<00:02:28.850> will<00:02:29.090> do<00:02:29.209> is<00:02:29.239> if

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
and basically what that will do is if

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.650 
and basically what that will do is if
you<00:02:29.569> fall<00:02:30.310> will<00:02:31.310> actually<00:02:31.730> stop<00:02:32.150> your<00:02:32.330> fall

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
you fall will actually stop your fall

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:36.309 
you fall will actually stop your fall
okay<00:02:33.260> what<00:02:33.890> you<00:02:34.040> can<00:02:34.220> then<00:02:34.430> do<00:02:34.670> is<00:02:34.940> engage<00:02:35.720> this

00:02:36.309 --> 00:02:36.319 
okay what you can then do is engage this

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:40.460 
okay what you can then do is engage this
particular<00:02:36.650> device

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.920 

turning<00:02:41.310> across<00:02:41.610> to<00:02:41.760> the<00:02:41.850> green<00:02:42.090> section<00:02:42.540> and

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
turning across to the green section and

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.140 
turning across to the green section and
then<00:02:43.230> allowing<00:02:43.980> the<00:02:44.220> person<00:02:44.370> to<00:02:44.610> be<00:02:44.760> lowered

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
then allowing the person to be lowered

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:46.910 
then allowing the person to be lowered
to<00:02:45.270> the<00:02:45.300> ground<00:02:45.390> to<00:02:45.840> safety<00:02:46.260> at<00:02:46.380> around<00:02:46.650> okay

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
to the ground to safety at around okay

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.950 
to the ground to safety at around okay
or<00:02:47.700> you<00:02:47.730> can<00:02:47.970> just<00:02:48.090> simply<00:02:48.420> leave<00:02:48.630> it<00:02:48.750> in<00:02:48.840> this

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:48.960 
or you can just simply leave it in this

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:51.860 
or you can just simply leave it in this
particular<00:02:49.170> setting<00:02:50.300> locks<00:02:51.300> you<00:02:51.480> off<00:02:51.630> and

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
particular setting locks you off and

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:54.620 
particular setting locks you off and
then<00:02:51.930> loes<00:02:52.410> you<00:02:52.620> gently<00:02:53.010> to<00:02:53.190> ground<00:02:53.430> okay<00:02:54.000> so

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
then loes you gently to ground okay so

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:56.560 
then loes you gently to ground okay so
it's<00:02:54.780> a<00:02:54.840> unique<00:02:55.110> device<00:02:55.470> it's<00:02:55.950> one<00:02:56.190> that's
