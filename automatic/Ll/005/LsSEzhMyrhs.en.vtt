00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:08.930
 hi my name is laura rodrÃ­guez in 

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:11.230
 this class we will learn the parts of 

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:11.230
 fiddle 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.200
 this instrument belongs to the family 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.760
 of the strings there are two types of 

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:22.950
 string instruments on one side 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.200
 we have the strings plucked in the 

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:27.570
 which the strings are torn or pressed to 

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:29.790
 these belong the guitar the harp the 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.380
 electric bass among others on the other hand 

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:33.150
 we found the string instruments 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.129
 rubbed that need a bow to 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:37.770
 rub or rub the strings and thus emit 

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:40.110
 the sound to this group belong the 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.900
 violin viola the violoncello and 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.340
 double bass the violin is the smallest 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:46.739
 of the instruments of the family of 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.589
 rubbed cords and because of this you can 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.330
 emit sharper sounds the violin is 

00:00:49.589 --> 00:00:53.640
 formed by a sounding board that 

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:55.229
 is responsible for producing the sound if 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.030
 you watch the violin in front you will see that 

00:00:55.229 --> 00:01:00.089
 It has two holes that by its shape 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:03.120
 they receive several names ears stools or 

00:01:00.089 --> 00:01:05.309
 efes in the interior there is a very 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.110
 important that is called the soul and its 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.640
 function is to improve the sound quality 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.680
 produced in the soundboard 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.900
 Now let's look at the black part of 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:17.310
 violin that also has several names 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:19.720
 Fingerboard is the most common handle or up 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.220
 this is a very important part of 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:23.590
 violin because on the fingerboard it 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:25.360
 find the ropes thought the part 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:27.400
 top of the violin is called head or 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:29.110
 headstock for here as you can see there 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:30.580
 four pegs that we use to 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:32.800
 tense the strings and find the 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:34.810
 violin tuning times white object 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.729
 next to the sefh is this part of the 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:39.220
 violin is called bridge and its function is 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:40.690
 lift the ropes if the bridge does not 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:42.789
 is correctly located the 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:44.410
 violin does not sound the part of the violin that 

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:46.390
 we are pointing out at this time 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:49.300
 call chordal because here the 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:51.100
 strings the tailpiece is connected with a 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:52.780
 button that as you can see is found 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:54.369
 on the bottom of the violin and its 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:56.470
 function is to give support so that 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:58.240
 ropes can be tightened next to the 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:59.979
 cordal is the chin strap that 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.050
 serves to make it more comfortable to support the 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:04.119
 chin when you play the violin like 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:06.580
 we said previously a very 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:08.649
 important of the violin is the bow which 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:10.840
 It is made up of a wooden bar 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:13.870
 a ribbon formed with horsehair 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.819
 we call bristles the head that 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.920
 contains a screw to be able to tighten 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:19.959
 loosen the bristles and the is not that 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.969
 handles to hold them but so that the 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:23.260
 arch can be treated comfortably by 

00:02:21.969 --> 00:02:25.120
 violin strings 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.859
 we must impregnate the sows with a 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.409
 resin of plant origin called 

00:02:26.859 --> 00:02:31.060
 weight as well as the instruments of 

00:02:29.409 --> 00:02:32.620
 family of the rubbed strings have 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.420
 different sizes according to the 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:36.069
 sounds that emit the arc that is 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:38.709
 used to play the instrument 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:40.659
 also change size this works 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:42.609
 so the biggest one in our family is 

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:45.269
 the contrabass and is the one that emits sounds 

00:02:42.609 --> 00:02:45.269
 more serious 

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:50.900
 then follow the cello or cello 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:53.530
 emits sounds sharper than 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.530
 double bass 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:00.750
 then the viola and finally the violin 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:00.750
 which is the smallest 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:10.159
 if we compare this family with a 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:12.709
 real family would be the bass 

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:14.390
 dad the cello the mom rapes her the 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:17.000
 older brother and the violin the brother 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:18.650
 smaller knowing this we might think that 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.810
 the size of the arch is proportional to the 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:23.359
 of the instrument but this is not the case 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:24.680
 The smaller the instrument, the more 

00:03:23.359 --> 00:03:27.859
 long is the length that we use to 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:30.950
 play them for example a violin bow and 

00:03:27.859 --> 00:03:33.889
 on average 75 centimeters and to the 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:35.689
 double bass 70 centimeters what yes 

00:03:33.889 --> 00:03:37.939
 changes proportionally with respect to 

00:03:35.689 --> 00:03:40.189
 The size of the instrument is the thickness of 

00:03:37.939 --> 00:03:43.930
 the bow rod between the larger the 

00:03:40.189 --> 00:03:43.930
 thickest instrument is the rod 

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:50.120
 do not forget to go to the practice of 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:50.120
 Chao violin parts
