00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:36.850 
it 12
456<00:01:31.690> so<00:01:32.690> that's<00:01:32.900> kind<00:01:33.200> of<00:01:33.370> diverse<00:01:34.370> group<00:01:35.860> and

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:36.860 
456 so that's kind of diverse group and

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.940 
456 so that's kind of diverse group and
I<00:01:36.950> think<00:01:37.160> it's<00:01:37.250> really<00:01:37.310> fun<00:01:37.700> and<00:01:38.710> I'm<00:01:39.710> going<00:01:39.890> to

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950 
I think it's really fun and I'm going to

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.000 
I think it's really fun and I'm going to
slow<00:01:40.190> it<00:01:40.310> down<00:01:40.340> just<00:01:40.610> a<00:01:40.760> little<00:01:40.940> bit<00:01:42.010> basically

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:43.010 
slow it down just a little bit basically

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:48.280 
slow it down just a little bit basically
this<00:01:43.670> hand<00:01:44.060> never<00:01:44.479> stops<00:01:44.930> doing<00:01:47.140> and<00:01:48.140> so

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:48.290 
this hand never stops doing and so

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:49.660 
this hand never stops doing and so
that's<00:01:48.470> why<00:01:48.650> it's<00:01:48.680> kind<00:01:49.070> of<00:01:49.130> the<00:01:49.220> shuffle

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
that's why it's kind of the shuffle

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:56.380 
that's why it's kind of the shuffle
field<00:01:51.580> and<00:01:53.979> then<00:01:54.979> this<00:01:55.130> hand<00:01:55.399> is<00:01:55.520> just<00:01:55.700> you

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390
