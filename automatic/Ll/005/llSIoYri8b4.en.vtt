00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.110 
layer turn it upside down so you have a

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:11.040 
layer turn it upside down so you have a
nice<00:02:08.259> flat<00:02:08.560> surface<00:02:08.590> and<00:02:09.599> place<00:02:10.599> it<00:02:10.780> right<00:02:10.989> on

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.050

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:13.559 
nice flat surface and place it right on
top<00:02:11.440> and<00:02:11.769> then<00:02:12.550> what<00:02:12.640> I<00:02:12.670> usually<00:02:12.730> do<00:02:13.239> is<00:02:13.540> just

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569 
top and then what I usually do is just

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:16.880 
top and then what I usually do is just
make<00:02:14.200> sure<00:02:14.440> all<00:02:14.709> the<00:02:15.250> sides<00:02:15.459> are<00:02:15.910> all<00:02:15.970> lined<00:02:16.360> up

make sure all the sides are all lined up

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.580

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
farther than the other just then I go

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:27.479 
farther than the other just then I go
around<00:02:23.500> and<00:02:23.860> check<00:02:24.900> really<00:02:25.900> quickly<00:02:26.340> and<00:02:27.340> then

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:27.489

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
all the way around the sides of the cake

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:44.870 
all the way around the sides of the cake
it<00:02:42.489> doesn't<00:02:42.760> have<00:02:42.880> to<00:02:42.970> be<00:02:43.090> neat<00:02:43.360> tidy<00:02:44.140> even

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
it doesn't have to be neat tidy even

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.420 
it doesn't have to be neat tidy even
none<00:02:45.880> of<00:02:46.000> that<00:02:46.030> just<00:02:46.390> make<00:02:46.599> sure<00:02:47.130> most<00:02:48.130> of<00:02:48.340> the

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430 
none of that just make sure most of the

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:53.819 
none of that just make sure most of the
cake<00:02:48.640> is<00:02:48.819> covered<00:02:51.810> and<00:02:52.810> what<00:02:53.019> a<00:02:53.049> crumb<00:02:53.530> coat

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:53.829 
cake is covered and what a crumb coat

00:02:53.829 --> 00:02:59.550 
cake is covered and what a crumb coat
does<00:02:54.250> is<00:02:54.849> help<00:02:56.250> adhere<00:02:57.250> the<00:02:57.489> crumbs<00:02:58.530> to<00:02:59.530> the

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
does is help adhere the crumbs to the

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:00.870 
does is help adhere the crumbs to the
cake<00:02:59.920> so<00:03:00.220> that<00:03:00.340> when<00:03:00.430> you<00:03:00.489> go<00:03:00.610> to<00:03:00.640> do<00:03:00.790> your

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:00.880 
cake so that when you go to do your

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:03.930 
cake so that when you go to do your
second<00:03:01.329> layer<00:03:01.450> of<00:03:01.980> frosting<00:03:03.040> there's<00:03:03.760> no

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940 
second layer of frosting there's no

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:05.490 
second layer of frosting there's no
crumbs<00:03:04.209> on<00:03:04.540> the<00:03:04.569> outside<00:03:04.930> so<00:03:05.110> it<00:03:05.140> looks<00:03:05.349> nice

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
crumbs on the outside so it looks nice

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.500 
crumbs on the outside so it looks nice
and<00:03:05.680> clean<00:03:05.769> and<00:03:06.099> I<00:03:06.549> usually<00:03:06.670> do<00:03:06.879> a<00:03:06.940> really<00:03:07.180> thin

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510 
and clean and I usually do a really thin

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:10.590 
and clean and I usually do a really thin
layer<00:03:08.340> some<00:03:09.340> people<00:03:09.549> do<00:03:09.639> a<00:03:09.850> thicker<00:03:10.150> layer<00:03:10.359> for

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:10.600 
layer some people do a thicker layer for

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:12.420 
layer some people do a thicker layer for
crumb<00:03:10.750> coating<00:03:11.079> but<00:03:11.230> I<00:03:11.470> prefer<00:03:11.859> the<00:03:12.010> nice<00:03:12.160> thin

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:12.430 
crumb coating but I prefer the nice thin

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:14.430 
crumb coating but I prefer the nice thin
layer<00:03:12.609> so<00:03:13.450> next<00:03:13.600> what<00:03:13.750> I'm<00:03:13.810> going<00:03:13.930> to<00:03:13.989> do<00:03:14.139> is

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:14.440 
layer so next what I'm going to do is

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:19.650 
layer so next what I'm going to do is
use<00:03:15.340> a<00:03:15.850> bench<00:03:16.750> scraper<00:03:16.989> or<00:03:17.560> cake<00:03:18.010> scraper<00:03:18.660> like

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:19.660

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:24.609 
right up against the cake and also flat

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:25.949

like<00:03:39.590> I<00:03:39.680> said<00:03:39.740> before<00:03:40.100> it<00:03:40.160> doesn't<00:03:40.220> have<00:03:40.460> to<00:03:40.550> be

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:40.640 
like I said before it doesn't have to be

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:41.980 
like I said before it doesn't have to be
completely<00:03:41.000> neat<00:03:41.270> I<00:03:41.450> mean<00:03:41.600> this<00:03:41.720> is<00:03:41.870> your

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:41.990

bottom coat it's basically just keeping

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:45.700 
bottom coat it's basically just keeping
the<00:03:44.240> crumbs<00:03:44.450> stuck<00:03:44.690> to<00:03:44.810> the<00:03:44.900> cake<00:03:45.080> so<00:03:45.320> doesn't

cake is this one's small so I'm just
gonna<00:04:09.020> do<00:04:09.200> an<00:04:09.320> hour<00:04:09.440> and<00:04:09.740> then<00:04:10.610> we'll<00:04:10.700> move<00:04:10.820> on

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:10.970 
gonna do an hour and then we'll move on

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:13.210 
gonna do an hour and then we'll move on
to<00:04:11.000> the<00:04:11.150> next<00:04:11.300> step<00:04:11.540> so<00:04:12.440> it's<00:04:12.800> been<00:04:12.950> an<00:04:13.040> hour

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:13.220 
to the next step so it's been an hour

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:16.030 
to the next step so it's been an hour
and<00:04:13.640> my<00:04:14.480> cake<00:04:14.720> is<00:04:14.870> completely<00:04:14.990> chilled<00:04:15.800> and

set it's completely firm to the touch so

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:21.699 
set it's completely firm to the touch so
the<00:04:19.730> next<00:04:20.000> step<00:04:20.150> is<00:04:20.299> to<00:04:20.420> apply<00:04:20.510> the<00:04:21.049> last<00:04:21.290> coat
