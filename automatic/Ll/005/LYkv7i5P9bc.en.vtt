00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:03.670 
360 all the way around and it could also

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:07.920 
360 all the way around and it could also
not<00:04:04.180> like<00:04:04.570> this<00:04:04.870> and<00:04:05.380> to<00:04:05.620> the<00:04:05.650> side<00:04:06.450> so<00:04:07.450> if<00:04:07.780> you

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:07.930 
not like this and to the side so if you

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:09.650 
not like this and to the side so if you
look<00:04:08.200> at<00:04:08.320> it<00:04:08.470> it's<00:04:08.620> actually<00:04:08.739> on<00:04:09.010> a<00:04:09.040> ball<00:04:09.340> joint

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:09.660 
look at it it's actually on a ball joint

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:14.550

like<00:04:10.660> let<00:04:10.840> me<00:04:10.930> take<00:04:11.140> it<00:04:11.290> off<00:04:12.420> so<00:04:13.420> give<00:04:14.140> him<00:04:14.320> some

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:14.560

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:16.740 
like let me take it off so give him some
really<00:04:14.739> cool<00:04:15.040> movement<00:04:15.579> I<00:04:15.910> think<00:04:16.390> that's

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:16.750 
really cool movement I think that's

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:19.620 
really cool movement I think that's
really<00:04:16.900> cool<00:04:17.200> and<00:04:17.709> his<00:04:18.130> legs<00:04:18.400> they<00:04:18.880> also<00:04:19.180> move

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:19.630 
really cool and his legs they also move

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:26.850 
really cool and his legs they also move
around<00:04:19.810> like<00:04:20.169> this<00:04:24.990> both<00:04:25.990> the<00:04:26.229> front<00:04:26.500> and<00:04:26.620> the

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:26.860 
around like this both the front and the

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:30.700 
around like this both the front and the
back<00:04:26.950> and<00:04:27.669> his<00:04:28.479> tail<00:04:28.750> spins

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:30.710 
back and his tail spins

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:33.340 
back and his tail spins
now<00:04:31.310> I<00:04:31.610> think<00:04:31.669> that's<00:04:31.940> pretty<00:04:32.090> cool<00:04:32.600> now<00:04:33.110> his

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:33.350 
now I think that's pretty cool now his

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:37.689 
now I think that's pretty cool now his
wings<00:04:33.710> are<00:04:34.039> separate<00:04:35.620> from<00:04:36.620> the<00:04:37.190> rest<00:04:37.370> of<00:04:37.550> his

00:04:37.689 --> 00:04:37.699 
wings are separate from the rest of his

00:04:37.699 --> 00:04:41.830 
wings are separate from the rest of his
