about<00:00:12.990> this<00:00:13.320> phone<00:00:13.590> is<00:00:13.620> that<00:00:13.799> it<00:00:13.889> does

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
about this phone is that it does

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.550 
about this phone is that it does
implement<00:00:14.610> all<00:00:15.299> the<00:00:15.570> great<00:00:15.809> designs<00:00:16.199> from<00:00:16.410> all

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
implement all the great designs from all

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.760 
implement all the great designs from all
the<00:00:16.680> previous<00:00:16.859> Evo's<00:00:17.550> in<00:00:18.390> one<00:00:18.720> and<00:00:19.020> what

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
the previous Evo's in one and what

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.040 
the previous Evo's in one and what
better<00:00:19.920> way<00:00:20.039> than<00:00:20.160> taking<00:00:20.670> it<00:00:20.730> apart<00:00:21.060> so<00:00:21.869> this

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
better way than taking it apart so this

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.710 
better way than taking it apart so this
was<00:00:22.769> first<00:00:23.070> on<00:00:23.400> here<00:00:23.760> a<00:00:23.910> lot<00:00:24.359> of<00:00:24.480> the<00:00:24.539> screws

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
was first on here a lot of the screws

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:25.939 
was first on here a lot of the screws
are<00:00:24.840> taking<00:00:25.080> off<00:00:25.170> just<00:00:25.199> to<00:00:25.500> make<00:00:25.619> this<00:00:25.710> process

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
are taking off just to make this process

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.640 
are taking off just to make this process
a<00:00:26.130> little<00:00:26.160> bit<00:00:26.400> faster<00:00:27.199> first<00:00:28.199> I<00:00:28.320> take<00:00:28.439> that

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
a little bit faster first I take that

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:42.830 
a little bit faster first I take that
off<00:00:30.500> this<00:00:31.500> part<00:00:31.859> comes<00:00:32.099> off<00:00:40.579> and<00:00:41.579> this<00:00:42.570> idea

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
off this part comes off and this idea

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.560 
off this part comes off and this idea
came<00:00:43.260> from<00:00:43.469> the<00:00:43.620> design<00:00:43.950> you<00:00:44.610> drop<00:00:44.969> the<00:00:45.239> screen

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
came from the design you drop the screen

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.240 
came from the design you drop the screen
downwards<00:00:47.030> and<00:00:48.030> the<00:00:49.020> whole<00:00:49.200> thing<00:00:49.530> slides<00:00:49.980> out

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
downwards and the whole thing slides out

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.540 
downwards and the whole thing slides out
and<00:00:51.020> this<00:00:52.020> is<00:00:52.199> made<00:00:52.379> out<00:00:52.410> of<00:00:52.530> metal<00:00:52.770> for<00:00:53.370> better

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
and this is made out of metal for better

00:00:53.550 --> 00:01:05.950 
and this is made out of metal for better
protection<00:00:54.090> for<00:00:54.239> your<00:00:54.390> screen

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:05.960 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:12.740 

take<00:01:06.960> the<00:01:07.110> battery<00:01:07.500> out<00:01:10.190> can<00:01:11.190> you<00:01:11.280> see<00:01:11.460> that<00:01:11.750> mm

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
take the battery out can you see that mm

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.540 
take the battery out can you see that mm
mmm<00:01:13.190> it's<00:01:14.190> a<00:01:14.250> very<00:01:14.460> big<00:01:14.760> battery<00:01:15.210> actually<00:01:15.390> but

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:16.550 
mmm it's a very big battery actually but

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:41.840 
mmm it's a very big battery actually but
still<00:01:17.550> in<00:01:17.670> turtle

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.270 

two<00:01:42.720> screws<00:01:43.080> are<00:01:43.350> right<00:01:43.530> here<00:01:43.890> originally

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
two screws are right here originally

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.800 
two screws are right here originally
took<00:01:45.000> those<00:01:45.180> out<00:01:45.420> already<00:01:45.750> and<00:01:47.479> pop<00:01:48.479> this<00:01:48.689> guy

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
took those out already and pop this guy

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:56.330 
took those out already and pop this guy
forwards<00:01:53.659> the<00:01:54.659> motherboards<00:01:55.229> the<00:01:55.290> same<00:01:55.560> size

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
forwards the motherboards the same size

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:04.490 
forwards the motherboards the same size
as<00:01:56.610> the<00:01:56.729> 3d<00:01:57.060> half<00:01:58.049> the<00:01:58.259> phone<00:02:02.390> the<00:02:03.390> microUSB<00:02:03.869> is

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
as the 3d half the phone the microUSB is

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.710 
as the 3d half the phone the microUSB is
soldered<00:02:04.979> pretty<00:02:05.549> well<00:02:05.789> onto<00:02:06.180> the<00:02:06.270> board

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.680 

and<00:02:09.720> there<00:02:10.050> you<00:02:10.200> go

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
and there you go

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:17.090
