00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:07.660
 hi friends, let's do a job that 

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:09.690
 in my case it's going to be quite important 

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:12.250
 on the cultivation of it it is for now 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.019
 well these separate ones were planted as 

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:16.150
 you know if you have seen other videos 

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:20.109
 of my channel by the way subscribe if you 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:22.480
 it is interesting to give likes and 

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:24.810
 continue uploading videos to know that yes 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:28.199
 which is interesting for someone 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:30.300
 good after this parenthesis as you 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.870
 said in the cultivation of asparagus that 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:38.079
 have made through claw 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:40.100
 It's on issues April 2013 

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:43.519
 we go 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:46.370
 do a job that is called rcb although 

00:00:43.519 --> 00:00:49.940
 we are going to take it for another question 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:51.379
 that now I explain my land I have the 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:52.820
 garden sitting in this case the 

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:55.820
 Asparagus is a pretty land 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:57.110
 clayey and although the preparing or 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:59.329
 when I did the preparation of the land 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:02.239
 before putting the talons of contributions 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:07.190
 as many times as enough quantities 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:10.640
 of sand because it does not need to continue 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:12.920
 contributing more this amount of substrates 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.060
 of sand although it is inert enough 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:18.950
 fundamental in the cultivation of asparagus 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:21.500
 because it facilitates its emergence and does not 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:23.000
 makes the exit so difficult 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.950
 with which we will have greater 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.740
 production and this will be of greater 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:29.100
 reality and it's not going to have that much 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.590
 fiber 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:35.040
 well I have removed all the bad 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.750
 herbs that I have still been able to 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.220
 done is qualified from the part 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.590
 superficial of the land agrees 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.049
 used in the hand qualifier that 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.750
 be small that does not go much because 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:48.210
 yours asparagus stalks 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.869
 that here we are called in some places 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.869
 duster 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.979
 He may be coming out and using 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.530
 a heavier tool or that 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:00.600
 deepen more we can damage them and 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.640
 prevent it from coming out and therefore lower 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.259
 production well as I tell you I already have 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.659
 made a stratification of 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:08.910
 ground and remove the weeds and 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:12.300
 let's proceed to make a contribution in 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:14.550
 first place wake manure is 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.050
 pretty done no more fear you take 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:18.480
 about three years 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:22.010
 on the ground without using it was 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:24.830
 true the cattle came pretty rich 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:27.260
 Wealth is lower 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:31.760
 the horse's richest 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:35.330
 everything that originated animal as you see 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:37.819
 here in this case it brings nutrients what 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:40.240
 what we are going to do is contribute 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:42.360
 my water retention capabilities 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:45.890
 as well as 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:50.560
 ground aviation inability 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:53.040
 we spread the manure a little 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.040
 yes 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:04.970
 a good stage as you see I have removed 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:08.390
 previously drip irrigation 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:14.020
 the asparagus needs a 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:16.760
 and a fairly high watering 

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:18.120
 tells us when planning your 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.819
 orchard 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:23.090
 in all the question not having to be 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:28.510
 irrigation 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:28.510
 we cut everything for a good layer 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:42.180
 and then what we are going to do is 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:44.490
 the sanding itself that 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:47.810
 is to contribute as I say the 

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:47.810
 sand on the ground 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:53.180
 when they were doing work at 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:55.579
 cultivation this sand will happen 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:59.290
 to the whole land and it will be in 

00:03:55.579 --> 00:04:01.480
 Depth allowing the best output 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:04.439
 of the tours basements of the 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:06.879
 asparagus that is what interests us 

00:04:04.439 --> 00:04:10.680
 get it because it's going to be the part that we 

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:10.680
 eat vale 

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:13.640
 as I say we will behave filled 

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:17.150
 let's 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:19.790
 to deposit a layer without mixing the 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:22.490
 45 centimeters above the level until the 

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:24.880
 we have from the surface 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:28.420
 and in this way 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:29.900
 besides making a contribution of sand we are going 

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:33.880
 to get 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:36.290
 an effect has clicked start to 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:38.720
 stop the production of weeds 

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:40.840
 that go less because they are always going to 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:43.480
 go out 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:46.740
 allow reflected that the soil does not 

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:46.740
 want so much temperature 

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:54.970
 and also will allow to seep 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:58.660
 better the irrigation and that the use 

00:04:54.970 --> 00:05:01.810
 of water is greater because having a 

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:04.330
 layer as you see the color is white 

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:08.110
 eliminates much of the solar radiation 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:10.570
 and will prevent it from going through the great 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:12.200
 part of the water that we are contributing to 

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:15.409
 culture 

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:19.539
 let's move on to perform 

00:05:15.409 --> 00:05:19.539
 in the contribution of sand 

00:05:19.689 --> 00:05:22.229
 Y 

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:26.350
 shovel help 

00:05:27.889 --> 00:05:34.900
 it's normal sand 

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:34.900
 of sand washed river 

00:05:35.139 --> 00:05:40.470
 is all inert material is something those 

00:05:38.139 --> 00:05:42.360
 seeds have been deposited 

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:45.050
 or land that has been deposited by 

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:48.540
 air effect is enough time 

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:51.150
 on the terrain 

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:55.610
 and doing this operation I say goodbye 

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:55.610
 until another time, friends, see you later
