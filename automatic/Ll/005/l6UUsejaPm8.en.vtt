though I had a mini rant this game is
pretty<00:01:58.439> good<00:01:58.709> and<00:01:59.069> I<00:01:59.249> would<00:01:59.310> say<00:01:59.639> try<00:01:59.939> tight

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240

pretty good and I would say try tight
but<00:02:00.779> it<00:02:00.899> might<00:02:01.139> not<00:02:01.319> be<00:02:01.409> everyone's<00:02:01.770> cup<00:02:01.950> of

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159

standards<00:02:04.560> however<00:02:05.100> I<00:02:05.340> think<00:02:05.759> it's<00:02:05.909> worth<00:02:06.090> the

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
standards however I think it's worth the

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.150 
standards however I think it's worth the
dough<00:02:06.420> and<00:02:06.630> at<00:02:06.899> the<00:02:07.020> cheap<00:02:07.200> price<00:02:07.380> I'm<00:02:07.770> giving

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
dough and at the cheap price I'm giving

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.690 
dough and at the cheap price I'm giving
it<00:02:08.250> a<00:02:08.340> 3.5<00:02:09.000> out<00:02:09.420> of<00:02:09.479> 5
