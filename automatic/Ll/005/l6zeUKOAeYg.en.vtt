00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:21.440
 bmw m3 for over 20 years is the 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:23.570
 sportiest threesome for the 

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:25.520
 driving dynamic olymp of the automobiles 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:28.360
 middle class such a car is fast 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:28.360
 to the heart affair 

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:32.640
 I can still get a first m3 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.380
 as my father remembers us home 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.070
 came with the pictures says the car has 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.780
 I ordered 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.940
 that does not work as he does 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.010
 The yard was from the time was 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.860
 simply the love for the series bmw 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:47.010
 m3 was written the first time you forget 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:49.590
 Never let alone in a m3 only 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.600
 meter with a bmw m3 drive without 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.970
 One often has a driving license 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.700
 can sleep my old gentleman was with 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:58.650
 the kartfahren the fathers of the pub on 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:59.550
 beautifully threaded and how to have boys 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:01.680
 the car keys of the parents 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.550
 steals and are nice on the kartbahn 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.350
 umgefahren 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.670
 until sometime the mother sprouts 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.690
 ran and heard how he drives 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:11.670
 actually this car out there this 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:13.979
 There are cars out there in the meantime 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.450
 the fourth generation likes that 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.640
 sheet metal dress and the number of cylinders 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.770
 have changed over the years his 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.470
 style remains the m3 faithful powerful 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:25.220
 masculine just like that and not otherwise 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.220
 him the fans 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:33.360
 Under the hood meanwhile rules 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:33.360
 high speed v8 with 420 ps 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:46.130
 Closed rural roads are his territory 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:48.950
 whether straight or straight main thing forward 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:52.330
 natural enemies know a m3 here 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.330
 good as no brother village 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:07.689
 as confident as the new c 63 amg 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:08.649
 you have to blow his ass 

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:11.080
 doubt 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:13.780
 finally affalterbach meant seriously 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:16.060
 the mercedes c-class long that 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.800
 stepchild in the amg product range 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.280
 he now to the sporty spearhead 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.800
 become 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:28.540
 the stuff he has to make sure 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:30.160
 just the 6.3 liter v8 457 ps exactly 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.540
 to be fascinated again and again like 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.709
 mercedes just creates so much 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.299
 performance in the place and to pack 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:35.730
 that it still holds everything and on the 

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:38.170
 road goes 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:39.549
 He presses on the gas pedal 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:42.280
 then it really pulls the car after 

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:42.760
 Rear pushes 600 newton meters are too 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.440
 installs 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:47.110
 The circuit is an automatic transmission 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:49.390
 with seesaws but when I'm on the lever for 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:50.799
 switch it down then there is 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:52.209
 Meanwhile gasstoÃŸ first there 

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:53.950
 something thought broken something 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:55.420
 but that's just really that's it 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:57.130
 just that belongs in the car when 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:58.750
 I already say I build such an apparatus 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:00.250
 with automatic then I have to at least 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:02.380
 Being able to be there is an intermediate gas 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.090
 little real race feeling in the pipe in 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:06.130
 room and also let it come up and it 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:08.570
 helps for dynamic 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:10.130
 driving dynamics is not the keyword 

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:11.150
 just the paraded discipline of 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:13.580
 predecessor models 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:18.140
 blame that esp pretty much 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:20.000
 departed for the first time in amg c63 we 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:22.790
 may turn everything off before us 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:27.860
 has forbidden to enjoy the driving pleasure 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:30.110
 sensational one c63 stop whoever 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:32.300
 the mountain roads on the condition too 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:34.910
 It's just that it had to move 

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:37.310
 Let's be the ingredients are all 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:37.820
 available to the n3 right paroli too 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:39.440
 Offer 

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:41.300
 but manages the mercedes also the 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:43.160
 rivals 

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:50.120
 or does the bmw finally have the 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:52.040
 nose front race track paul ricard in le 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:53.570
 castellet a special covering around the 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:55.640
 Both feel right on the tooth 

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:58.180
 otherwise quite different bolides turn here 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:58.180
 their rounds 

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:11.349
 the more than 66,000 euros expensive bmw goes as 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:14.109
 first on the course and is full in 

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:16.030
 his element here may be the v8 organs 

00:04:14.109 --> 00:04:17.500
 as he just needs it 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:21.789
 predecessors were consistently out 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:23.889
 simply bid clearly in the new m3 

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:26.199
 better the agile front axle out of the 

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:27.490
 The old ones just shadowed the 

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:28.780
 Rear axle that much better 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:32.259
 take 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:34.509
 that is very balanced very harmonious 

00:04:32.259 --> 00:04:36.009
 in the predecessor and the special csl was 

00:04:34.509 --> 00:04:39.070
 it so that you are a super strong 

00:04:36.009 --> 00:04:40.870
 the day before, the track had gotten wider that way 

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:42.070
 problem was only the rear axle has it 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:43.750
 get with me when I turn 

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:45.610
 have the front car is bent 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:48.900
 The hacker why fell like one 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:48.900
 coffin should get which has plants with 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:55.589
 can the c63 counter this 

00:04:58.619 --> 00:05:04.119
 optically even here one sicke since a 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:07.059
 powerdome and below a few sills 

00:05:04.119 --> 00:05:09.300
 from taxi image at this c-class no 

00:05:07.059 --> 00:05:09.300
 track 

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:18.330
 for proud 67800 euro but you can 

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:21.840
 also expect driving 0 to 100 

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:25.410
 km h in 4.7 seconds and that with 18 

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:27.570
 tons combat weight at 250 km / h takes 

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:29.490
 the involuntary self-control too 

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:32.970
 we owe this mileage 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:34.740
 the 6.2 liter v8 of which is potential 

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:40.240
 far from exhausted so 

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:42.500
 casually, he shakes 457 ps off his sleeve 

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:44.870
 the engine pushes out of the 

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:46.790
 speed cellar so vehemently forward 

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:48.260
 that can scare you 

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:50.390
 except for a slight under tax 

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:51.870
 There is a trend in the slow corners 

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:53.640
 almost nothing to complain about 

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:58.340
 on a grand prix track with long 

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:58.340
 Straight we see the c63 even front 

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:08.720
 m3 against c 63 m gmbh against amd was 

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:10.730
 earlier like a game of bavaria against 

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:11.380
 meppen ended today is a duel 

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:13.100
 eye level 

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:15.470
 in the end, the whole package has to be 

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:17.180
 one thing to be evaluated but still 

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:19.750
 Never was a result between the two 

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:19.750
 that works 

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:26.270
 the bmw was the place between the bmw 

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:28.040
 is still the place that is in 

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:30.230
 his overall composition is simple and has 

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:32.260
 a wonderful driving dynamics with 

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:34.190
 appropriate performance that fits 

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:36.860
 together that is really a whole 

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:38.000
 round history is the mercedes this 

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:40.190
 people on the pelt put the thing 

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.020
 has steam that is really incredible the 

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:44.050
 crib from gas that moves into the 

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:45.950
 Bridges in the rows of seats immense but 

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:47.270
 driving dynamics was not quite enough for the 

00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:48.770
 bmw to overtake 

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:50.060
 the question then remains exciting 

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:51.980
 What does it look like when we get there? 

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:53.420
 sometime in three four years over here 

00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:55.190
 the next generation sit again 

00:06:53.420 --> 00:07:00.080
 then I believe in the air again 

00:06:55.190 --> 00:07:03.190
 thinner the breath of the c63 t m3 already now 

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:03.190
 clearly in the neck
