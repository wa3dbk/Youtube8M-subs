the packaging that is in it just gets

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.719 
the packaging that is in it just gets
everywhere<00:01:13.290> when<00:01:13.770> you<00:01:13.799> apply<00:01:14.250> it<00:01:14.310> in<00:01:14.580> your

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
everywhere when you apply it in your

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.330 
everywhere when you apply it in your
hair<00:01:14.970> it<00:01:15.150> smells<00:01:15.540> good<00:01:15.990> but<00:01:16.380> if<00:01:16.650> they<00:01:16.890> had<00:01:17.159> it

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
hair it smells good but if they had it

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.950 
hair it smells good but if they had it
in<00:01:17.430> a<00:01:17.549> different<00:01:17.759> packaging<00:01:18.540> I<00:01:18.689> would

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
in a different packaging I would

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.100 
in a different packaging I would
probably<00:01:19.170> try<00:01:19.920> it<00:01:20.009> out<00:01:20.280> but<00:01:20.939> I<00:01:21.240> don't<00:01:21.990> really

probably try it out but I don't really

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.830 
probably try it out but I don't really
think<00:01:22.229> it's<00:01:22.590> worth<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:23.040> money<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:24.150> next<00:01:24.330> lush

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.780 
so I'm kind of disappointed about this I
thought<00:01:43.350> it<00:01:43.500> was<00:01:43.560> a<00:01:43.619> really<00:01:43.829> cool<00:01:44.100> concept<00:01:44.340> so

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
thought it was a really cool concept so

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.760 
thought it was a really cool concept so
I<00:01:44.820> worried<00:01:45.119> it<00:01:45.210> on<00:01:45.299> my<00:01:45.420> Christmas<00:01:45.659> list<00:01:46.110> that

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
was really excited when I got it but I

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.469 
was really excited when I got it but I
used<00:01:49.020> it<00:01:49.200> a<00:01:49.259> couple<00:01:49.290> times<00:01:49.590> and<00:01:50.390> can't<00:01:51.390> get

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
used it a couple times and can't get

the<00:02:21.390> time<00:02:21.599> i<00:02:22.140> used<00:02:22.469> it<00:02:23.189> to<00:02:23.489> set<00:02:23.879> my<00:02:24.150> makeup<00:02:24.359> a

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
the time i used it to set my makeup a

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.369 
the time i used it to set my makeup a
couple<00:02:25.500> times<00:02:25.709> but<00:02:26.159> honestly<00:02:26.879> it<00:02:27.299> just<00:02:27.379> feels

00:02:28.369 --> 00:02:28.379 
couple times but honestly it just feels

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:30.830 
couple times but honestly it just feels
like<00:02:28.859> it<00:02:29.010> kind<00:02:29.250> of<00:02:29.340> separates<00:02:29.909> my<00:02:30.239> makeup<00:02:30.629> it

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
like it kind of separates my makeup it

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.250 
like it kind of separates my makeup it
separates<00:02:31.290> to<00:02:31.409> my<00:02:31.530> powder<00:02:31.920> and<00:02:32.430> my<00:02:33.389> foundation

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
separates to my powder and my foundation

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.470 
separates to my powder and my foundation
and<00:02:34.469> it<00:02:34.620> just<00:02:34.950> looks<00:02:35.189> really<00:02:35.579> really<00:02:36.060> weird

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
and it just looks really really weird

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.809 
and it just looks really really weird
whenever<00:02:37.290> I<00:02:37.409> spray<00:02:37.950> this<00:02:38.129> it<00:02:38.340> kind<00:02:38.549> of<00:02:38.609> just

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:38.819 
whenever I spray this it kind of just

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:40.759 
whenever I spray this it kind of just
like<00:02:38.879> separates<00:02:39.719> on<00:02:39.930> my<00:02:40.049> skin<00:02:40.379> it's<00:02:40.530> really

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:40.769 
like separates on my skin it's really

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:42.890 
like separates on my skin it's really
hard<00:02:40.980> to<00:02:41.129> describe<00:02:41.489> but<00:02:41.609> i<00:02:42.090> don't<00:02:42.629> really<00:02:42.750> like

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
hard to describe but i don't really like

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.409 
hard to describe but i don't really like
it<00:02:43.230> to<00:02:43.349> set<00:02:43.590> makeup<00:02:43.859> I've<00:02:44.220> just<00:02:44.609> been<00:02:44.790> using<00:02:45.269> it

00:02:45.409 --> 00:02:45.419 
it to set makeup I've just been using it

00:02:45.419 --> 00:02:48.860 
it to set makeup I've just been using it
for<00:02:45.689> on<00:02:46.319> pigments<00:02:47.099> to<00:02:47.639> just<00:02:47.909> wet<00:02:48.090> my<00:02:48.299> brush<00:02:48.359> and

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
for on pigments to just wet my brush and

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:50.479 
for on pigments to just wet my brush and
dip<00:02:49.079> it<00:02:49.230> in<00:02:49.349> a<00:02:49.439> pigment<00:02:49.919> I<00:02:50.069> mean<00:02:50.220> it<00:02:50.340> works

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
dip it in a pigment I mean it works

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:53.119 
dip it in a pigment I mean it works
crews<00:02:50.760> the<00:02:50.970> foil<00:02:51.239> but<00:02:51.720> it's<00:02:52.230> not<00:02:52.349> really<00:02:52.739> meant

00:02:53.119 --> 00:02:53.129 
crews the foil but it's not really meant

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:55.250 
crews the foil but it's not really meant
for<00:02:53.280> that<00:02:53.609> it's<00:02:53.879> more<00:02:54.090> meant<00:02:54.359> to<00:02:54.599> like<00:02:54.780> spray

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
for that it's more meant to like spray

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.369 
for that it's more meant to like spray
your<00:02:56.040> skin<00:02:56.639> before<00:02:56.969> you<00:02:57.480> apply<00:02:57.719> makeup<00:02:58.139> or

00:02:58.369 --> 00:02:58.379 
your skin before you apply makeup or

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:01.670 
your skin before you apply makeup or
after<00:02:59.060> but<00:03:00.060> I<00:03:00.540> think<00:03:00.870> it's<00:03:01.019> just<00:03:01.109> as<00:03:01.439> greatest

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
after but I think it's just as greatest

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.500 
after but I think it's just as greatest
water<00:03:02.069> if<00:03:02.250> you're<00:03:02.400> just<00:03:02.639> going<00:03:02.909> to<00:03:03.060> use<00:03:03.209> it<00:03:03.389> the

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
water if you're just going to use it the

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:05.869 
water if you're just going to use it the
foil<00:03:03.780> pigments<00:03:04.349> honestly<00:03:04.889> so<00:03:05.430> I<00:03:05.459> wouldn't
