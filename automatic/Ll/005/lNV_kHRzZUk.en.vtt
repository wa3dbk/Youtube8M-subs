00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:39.800 
of the clock face we were talking about

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.979 
of the clock face we were talking about
earlier<00:00:40.010> on<00:00:40.370> we<00:00:41.030> should<00:00:41.210> hit<00:00:41.450> the<00:00:41.600> weight<00:00:41.750> ball

00:00:41.979 --> 00:00:41.989

for inori's another one I've seen any

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.690 
for inori's another one I've seen any
people<00:01:26.899> do<00:01:27.020> this<00:01:27.170> so<00:01:27.979> this<00:01:28.039> is<00:01:28.160> really<00:01:28.429> kind<00:01:28.580> of

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:28.700 
people do this so this is really kind of

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.639 
people do this so this is really kind of
Edinburgh<00:01:29.090> Glasgow<00:01:29.660> as<00:01:29.780> well<00:01:30.229> it<00:01:30.319> could<00:01:30.470> be

00:01:30.639 --> 00:01:30.649 
Edinburgh Glasgow as well it could be

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:34.029 
Edinburgh Glasgow as well it could be
yeah<00:01:30.800> yeah<00:01:31.550> right<00:01:32.479> so<00:01:33.050> I<00:01:33.080> saw<00:01:33.500> a<00:01:33.530> plantain<00:01:33.920> in

00:01:34.029 --> 00:01:34.039 
yeah yeah right so I saw a plantain in

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:40.480 
yeah yeah right so I saw a plantain in
there<00:01:34.220> okay<00:01:35.350> oh<00:01:36.350> you<00:01:37.160> know<00:01:39.009> so<00:01:40.009> how<00:01:40.100> I<00:01:40.130> see<00:01:40.340> did

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490 
there okay oh you know so how I see did

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:42.219 
there okay oh you know so how I see did
I<00:01:40.580> do<00:01:40.640> that<00:01:40.759> obviously<00:01:41.509> what<00:01:41.990> we're<00:01:42.110> gonna

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:42.229 
I do that obviously what we're gonna

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:43.630 
I do that obviously what we're gonna
find<00:01:42.470> out<00:01:42.590> now<00:01:42.709> is<00:01:42.830> the<00:01:42.920> science<00:01:43.340> of<00:01:43.429> how<00:01:43.490> I

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:43.640 
find out now is the science of how I

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.820 
find out now is the science of how I
achieved<00:01:44.060> that<00:01:44.319> spill<00:01:45.319> like<00:01:45.440> here's<00:01:45.649> one<00:01:45.800> I

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:45.830 
achieved that spill like here's one I

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:46.359 
achieved that spill like here's one I
made<00:01:45.890> earlier

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:46.369 
made earlier

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:48.639 
made earlier
but<00:01:46.640> yeah<00:01:47.149> Anika<00:01:47.599> throws<00:01:48.050> a<00:01:48.140> gap<00:01:48.410> between

00:01:48.639 --> 00:01:48.649 
but yeah Anika throws a gap between

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:55.059 
but yeah Anika throws a gap between
those<00:01:48.979> words<00:01:52.959> if<00:01:53.959> I'm<00:01:54.170> saved<00:01:54.470> in<00:01:54.590> the<00:01:54.649> pocket

00:01:55.059 --> 00:01:55.069 
those words if I'm saved in the pocket

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:58.540 
those words if I'm saved in the pocket
if<00:01:55.580> there<00:01:55.789> was<00:01:55.880> a<00:01:55.970> gap<00:01:56.979> you<00:01:57.979> HOT<00:01:58.130> it<00:01:58.280> no<00:01:58.399> we're

00:01:58.540 --> 00:01:58.550 
if there was a gap you HOT it no we're

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:00.699 
if there was a gap you HOT it no we're
fine<00:01:58.759> save<00:01:59.119> which<00:01:59.390> we<00:01:59.569> call<00:01:59.780> the<00:01:59.959> offset<00:02:00.380> plant

00:02:00.699 --> 00:02:00.709 
fine save which we call the offset plant

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:03.820 
fine save which we call the offset plant
this<00:02:01.490> is<00:02:01.640> also<00:02:01.819> a<00:02:02.000> plant<00:02:02.300> but<00:02:02.830> you've

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:03.830 
this is also a plant but you've

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:05.830 
this is also a plant but you've
obviously<00:02:03.950> got<00:02:04.369> to<00:02:04.429> have<00:02:04.670> it<00:02:04.819> all<00:02:05.360> right<00:02:05.599> hand

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 
obviously got to have it all right hand

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.600 
obviously got to have it all right hand
side

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.670 

when<00:02:09.610> the<00:02:09.700> balls<00:02:09.910> have<00:02:10.090> separated<00:02:10.569> it's<00:02:11.470> just

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
when the balls have separated it's just

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.330 
when the balls have separated it's just
normal<00:02:12.580> physics<00:02:13.120> or<00:02:13.300> suppose<00:02:13.599> yeah<00:02:13.959> but<00:02:14.770> when

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
normal physics or suppose yeah but when

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:18.300 
normal physics or suppose yeah but when
the<00:02:15.459> balls<00:02:15.670> are<00:02:15.880> touching<00:02:16.440> protectively<00:02:17.440> seem

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
the balls are touching protectively seem

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.460 
the balls are touching protectively seem
short<00:02:18.670> on<00:02:19.450> the<00:02:19.599> right-hand<00:02:19.959> side<00:02:20.080> of<00:02:20.410> the

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470 
short on the right-hand side of the

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:24.740 
short on the right-hand side of the
plant<00:02:20.739> you<00:02:21.010> would<00:02:21.940> mess<00:02:22.120> up<00:02:22.269> everything

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.600 

yeah<00:02:25.750> by<00:02:26.080> quite<00:02:26.290> a<00:02:26.319> distance<00:02:26.530> by<00:02:27.250> create
