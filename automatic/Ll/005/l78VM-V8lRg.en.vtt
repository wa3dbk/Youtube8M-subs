 you better still need a pot 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:33.149
 with half full water and me 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:35.100
 then have so much shell because we 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.630
 what have to heat and I cook 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.300
 but simply in a water bath 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:43.879

 three spoons or 30 grams in the 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:03.960
 bowl so next we betray that 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.350
 just until it melts completely 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.479
 is 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.740
 Next take from the food starch 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:13.619

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:20.729

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.100

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:54.160
 you can also liquid one is 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:55.330
 little bit of food starch to do but at 

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:59.380
 It's okay with me now 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:02.080
 next you give of yours 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:04.860
 animal oils which I noticed 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:10.470
 what I did not show you and 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:13.270
 yes, there are now 20 droplets approx 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:19.990
 and are simply mingled with I have 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:22.360
 By the way, orange scent taken and what 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:24.810

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:28.360

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:30.310

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:36.070
 is made because you want it after that 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:38.650
 with carriages and yes for perfumed the stuff 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:39.900
 Of course we are not so good as we are 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:44.670
 ending 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:46.810
 Let's add our sea salt and 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.880
 we simply make compliance 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:52.750
 tablespoon of sugar or just like you 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:57.330
 it wants to be perceived or felt 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:03:00.400
 easy and of course also stir 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:03.670

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:09.580
 so next would just do the things 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:12.610
 Form as you can see I already have 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:16.720
 Tried and I 'll do one now 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:18.790

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:25.990
 other things will be because I find 

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:28.960

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:32.310
 it is now in the fridge 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:41.380
 Unfortunately, I have the 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:43.150
 food coloring not found or 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:44.890
