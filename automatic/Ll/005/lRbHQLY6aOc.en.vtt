primitive<00:00:33.079> welding<00:00:34.079> techniques<00:00:34.910> and<00:00:35.910> I'll

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
primitive welding techniques and I'll

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.660 
primitive welding techniques and I'll
probably<00:00:36.180> be<00:00:36.360> doing<00:00:36.480> another<00:00:36.719> video<00:00:37.079> on<00:00:37.370> now<00:00:38.370> I

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
probably be doing another video on now I

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:39.830 
probably be doing another video on now I
don't<00:00:39.000> know<00:00:39.180> if<00:00:39.210> any<00:00:39.390> of<00:00:39.480> y'all<00:00:39.660> have<00:00:39.690> ever

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
tried to remove a 41 year old exhaust

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.610 
tried to remove a 41 year old exhaust
manifold<00:00:42.600> but<00:00:42.840> sometimes<00:00:43.170> it<00:00:43.350> can<00:00:43.469> be<00:00:43.500> pretty

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
manifold but sometimes it can be pretty

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.510 
manifold but sometimes it can be pretty
tough<00:00:43.890> and<00:00:45.559> you<00:00:46.559> can<00:00:46.770> you<00:00:46.980> can<00:00:47.129> get<00:00:47.280> in<00:00:47.370> there

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
tough and you can you can get in there

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.220 
tough and you can you can get in there
and<00:00:47.730> you<00:00:47.789> can<00:00:47.940> try<00:00:48.149> and<00:00:48.300> break<00:00:48.510> bolts<00:00:49.020> and

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
and you can try and break bolts and

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.569 
and you can try and break bolts and
they'll<00:00:49.379> strip<00:00:49.620> out<00:00:49.800> and<00:00:50.070> then<00:00:50.160> it<00:00:50.250> just<00:00:50.430> gives

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
they'll strip out and then it just gives

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.680 
they'll strip out and then it just gives
you<00:00:50.730> all<00:00:50.850> kinds<00:00:50.879> of<00:00:51.239> other<00:00:51.420> problems<00:00:51.899> but<00:00:53.690> this

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
stuff right here a PB Blaster it's great

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.700 
stuff right here a PB Blaster it's great
I<00:00:58.920> don't<00:00:59.100> know<00:00:59.840> got<00:01:00.840> any<00:01:01.050> of<00:01:01.140> y'all<00:01:01.260> ever<00:01:01.289> tried

00:01:24.999 --> 00:01:25.009 
like that and I soaked these bolts with

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:28.010 
like that and I soaked these bolts with
that<00:01:26.009> spray<00:01:26.430> stuff<00:01:26.700> let<00:01:27.180> it<00:01:27.299> penetrate<00:01:27.509> in

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020
