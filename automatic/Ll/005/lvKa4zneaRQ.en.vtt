schematic that I draw have drawn for you

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.920 
schematic that I draw have drawn for you
and<00:00:34.820> it's<00:00:35.820> called<00:00:36.360> the<00:00:36.960> our<00:00:37.440> EMF<00:00:38.399> charger<00:00:39.180> what

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
and it's called the our EMF charger what

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.229 
and it's called the our EMF charger what
it<00:00:40.050> can<00:00:40.260> do<00:00:40.500> you<00:00:40.800> can<00:00:41.010> charge<00:00:41.370> batteries

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
it can do you can charge batteries

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.639 
it can do you can charge batteries
non-rechargeable<00:00:43.079> batteries<00:00:44.570> old<00:00:45.570> lat<00:00:46.200> acid

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.160 
non-rechargeable batteries old lat acid
batteries<00:00:47.160> it<00:00:47.670> will<00:00:48.180> give<00:00:48.450> it<00:00:48.600> back<00:00:48.750> a<00:00:48.809> kick

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
batteries it will give it back a kick

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.220 
batteries it will give it back a kick
just<00:00:49.469> like<00:00:49.860> the<00:00:50.100> Bedini<00:00:50.489> system<00:00:51.090> does<00:00:51.360> but

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
just like the Bedini system does but

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.520 
just like the Bedini system does but
it's<00:00:52.530> very<00:00:53.430> very<00:00:53.820> very<00:00:54.360> efficient<00:00:55.140> and<00:00:55.350> it

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
it's very very very efficient and it

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.170 
it's very very very efficient and it
works<00:00:55.770> really<00:00:56.219> fast<00:00:57.230> alright<00:00:58.230> so<00:00:58.800> I<00:00:59.430> will

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
works really fast alright so I will

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.869 
works really fast alright so I will
point<00:01:00.390> it<00:01:00.570> out<00:01:00.660> with<00:01:00.870> my<00:01:01.079> pen<00:01:01.590> I'm<00:01:01.879> filming

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
point it out with my pen I'm filming

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.380 
point it out with my pen I'm filming
this<00:01:03.030> with<00:01:03.270> a<00:01:03.439> camera<00:01:04.439> a<00:01:04.979> photo<00:01:05.460> camera<00:01:05.939> so<00:01:06.180> if

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
this with a camera a photo camera so if

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:07.179 
this with a camera a photo camera so if
it<00:01:06.540> sucks

00:01:07.179 --> 00:01:07.189 
it sucks

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:10.250 
it sucks
too<00:01:08.189> bad<00:01:08.340> you<00:01:09.000> have<00:01:09.119> to<00:01:09.210> do<00:01:09.390> it<00:01:09.570> with<00:01:10.080> this

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
too bad you have to do it with this

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.710 
too bad you have to do it with this
alright<00:01:11.250> this<00:01:11.700> is<00:01:11.939> my<00:01:12.180> source<00:01:12.780> it's<00:01:13.680> a<00:01:13.860> 20<00:01:14.280> volt

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:14.720 
alright this is my source it's a 20 volt

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:19.310 
alright this is my source it's a 20 volt
DC<00:01:15.720> current<00:01:16.759> what<00:01:17.759> happens<00:01:18.150> is<00:01:18.360> the<00:01:18.540> plus<00:01:18.869> goes

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
DC current what happens is the plus goes

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.630 
DC current what happens is the plus goes
through<00:01:20.310> the<00:01:20.460> diode<00:01:21.799> to<00:01:22.799> the<00:01:22.979> battery<00:01:23.340> that<00:01:23.520> is

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
through the diode to the battery that is

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.090 
through the diode to the battery that is
to<00:01:23.850> be<00:01:23.970> charged<00:01:24.479> in<00:01:24.780> this<00:01:25.110> case<00:01:25.170> I<00:01:25.409> say<00:01:25.799> it's<00:01:26.009> a

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
to be charged in this case I say it's a

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.190 
to be charged in this case I say it's a
12<00:01:26.400> volt<00:01:26.759> battery<00:01:26.820> and<00:01:27.150> I<00:01:27.390> will<00:01:27.570> explain<00:01:27.960> you

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
12 volt battery and I will explain you

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.219 
12 volt battery and I will explain you
how<00:01:28.409> to<00:01:28.860> calculate<00:01:29.299> well<00:01:30.299> a<00:01:30.509> 12<00:01:30.930> volt<00:01:31.170> battery

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
how to calculate well a 12 volt battery

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.859 
how to calculate well a 12 volt battery
so<00:01:31.890> the<00:01:31.920> plus<00:01:32.340> goes<00:01:32.700> to<00:01:32.939> the<00:01:33.030> plus<00:01:33.299> of<00:01:33.329> the<00:01:33.509> 12

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
so the plus goes to the plus of the 12

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.819 
so the plus goes to the plus of the 12
volt<00:01:34.110> battery<00:01:34.500> the<00:01:35.280> minus<00:01:35.790> goes<00:01:36.060> on<00:01:36.829> towards

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
volt battery the minus goes on towards

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:41.899 
volt battery the minus goes on towards
the<00:01:38.820> coupling<00:01:39.689> of<00:01:39.840> the<00:01:40.020> jewel<00:01:40.290> thief<00:01:40.619> style<00:01:41.100> by

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090 
the same charging battery so what

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:14.580 
the same charging battery so what
happens<00:03:13.450> in<00:03:13.600> this<00:03:13.750> system<00:03:13.989> is<00:03:14.350> that<00:03:14.530> you

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
happens in this system is that you

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:17.100 
happens in this system is that you
charge<00:03:15.070> this<00:03:15.400> battery<00:03:15.459> with<00:03:16.000> 12<00:03:16.480> volts<00:03:16.750> and

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:17.110 
charge this battery with 12 volts and

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
after and the transistor closes it

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:26.310 
after and the transistor closes it
discharges<00:03:24.670> the<00:03:24.700> power<00:03:25.239> that<00:03:25.510> remains<00:03:25.959> here

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:26.320

with the higher voltage over the battery

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.009 
with the higher voltage over the battery
battery<00:03:30.190> again<00:03:30.640> so<00:03:31.300> what<00:03:31.450> happens<00:03:31.810> is<00:03:31.989> that

00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:32.019 
battery again so what happens is that

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:35.580

you<00:03:32.320> get<00:03:32.470> a<00:03:32.500> charge<00:03:32.860> 12<00:03:33.370> volts<00:03:33.820> and<00:03:33.970> about<00:03:34.590> 200

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.590 
you get a charge 12 volts and about 200

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:38.130 
you get a charge 12 volts and about 200
volts<00:03:36.010> but<00:03:36.190> with<00:03:36.730> a<00:03:36.760> spike<00:03:37.180> just<00:03:37.600> like<00:03:37.810> Bedini

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:38.140 
volts but with a spike just like Bedini

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:40.680 
volts but with a spike just like Bedini
does<00:03:38.380> what<00:03:39.130> happens<00:03:39.550> is<00:03:39.850> that<00:03:40.090> this<00:03:40.269> is<00:03:40.450> way

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:40.690 
does what happens is that this is way

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:42.660 
does what happens is that this is way
more<00:03:41.410> efficient<00:03:41.980> than<00:03:42.130> anything<00:03:42.370> I<00:03:42.640> ever

here<00:05:14.260> you<00:05:14.410> can<00:05:14.440> place<00:05:14.740> it<00:05:14.890> here<00:05:15.130> if<00:05:15.580> you<00:05:15.640> place

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:16.030 
here you can place it here if you place

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:17.970 
here you can place it here if you place
the<00:05:16.210> sire<00:05:16.450> and<00:05:16.720> diode<00:05:17.050> over<00:05:17.410> this<00:05:17.620> power

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:17.980 
the sire and diode over this power

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:20.100

supply<00:05:18.220> you<00:05:18.670> don't<00:05:18.940> blow<00:05:19.450> your<00:05:19.630> power<00:05:19.870> supply

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:20.110 
supply you don't blow your power supply

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:22.560 
supply you don't blow your power supply
and<00:05:21.010> what<00:05:21.220> you<00:05:21.340> can<00:05:21.460> do<00:05:21.580> you<00:05:21.790> can<00:05:22.000> charge<00:05:22.300> your

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:22.570 
and what you can do you can charge your

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:26.220 
and what you can do you can charge your
lot<00:05:23.020> acid<00:05:23.380> batteries<00:05:23.860> really<00:05:24.700> fast<00:05:25.000> and<00:05:25.360> even

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:26.230 
lot acid batteries really fast and even

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:29.640 
lot acid batteries really fast and even
old<00:05:26.830> ones<00:05:27.160> that<00:05:27.490> are<00:05:27.670> almost<00:05:28.060> dead<00:05:28.540> if<00:05:28.780> you<00:05:29.110> let

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:29.650 
old ones that are almost dead if you let

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:31.710 
old ones that are almost dead if you let
it<00:05:29.680> charge<00:05:30.070> overnight<00:05:30.670> over<00:05:31.180> a<00:05:31.210> couple<00:05:31.540> of

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:31.720 
it charge overnight over a couple of

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:32.130 
it charge overnight over a couple of
nights

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:32.140 
nights

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:35.190 
nights
this<00:05:32.800> one<00:05:33.040> gets<00:05:33.340> back<00:05:33.580> to<00:05:33.850> its<00:05:34.030> previous<00:05:34.630> state

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:35.200 
this one gets back to its previous state

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:37.050 
this one gets back to its previous state
it<00:05:35.500> gets<00:05:35.770> stronger<00:05:36.130> and<00:05:36.460> stronger<00:05:36.700> and

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:37.060 
it gets stronger and stronger and

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:39.630 
it gets stronger and stronger and
stronger<00:05:37.330> and<00:05:37.990> what<00:05:38.200> you<00:05:38.350> can<00:05:38.590> also<00:05:38.830> do<00:05:39.250> is

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:39.640 
stronger and what you can also do is

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:43.560 
stronger and what you can also do is
charge<00:05:40.620> non-rechargeable<00:05:41.620> batteries<00:05:42.570> in

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:43.570 
charge non-rechargeable batteries in

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:46.320 
charge non-rechargeable batteries in
this<00:05:43.870> place<00:05:44.200> and<00:05:44.470> that<00:05:44.770> also<00:05:44.980> works<00:05:45.400> the<00:05:45.670> fun

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:46.330 
this place and that also works the fun

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:48.810 
this place and that also works the fun
part<00:05:46.600> is<00:05:46.780> this<00:05:47.230> doesn't<00:05:47.740> heat<00:05:47.890> up<00:05:47.920> and<00:05:48.340> why

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:48.820 
part is this doesn't heat up and why

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:51.390 
part is this doesn't heat up and why
doesn't<00:05:49.060> it<00:05:49.210> heat<00:05:49.390> up<00:05:49.420> because<00:05:50.110> you<00:05:50.530> use<00:05:50.830> pulse

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:51.400 
doesn't it heat up because you use pulse

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:53.790 
doesn't it heat up because you use pulse
power<00:05:51.670> you<00:05:52.360> are<00:05:52.480> pulsing<00:05:52.780> this<00:05:53.140> at<00:05:53.440> a<00:05:53.470> very

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:53.800 
power you are pulsing this at a very

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:56.520 
power you are pulsing this at a very
high<00:05:54.010> frequency<00:05:54.090> about<00:05:55.090> 10<00:05:55.420> to<00:05:55.930> 20<00:05:56.290> kilohertz

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:56.530 
high frequency about 10 to 20 kilohertz

00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:59.670 
high frequency about 10 to 20 kilohertz
and<00:05:57.040> this<00:05:57.670> doesn't<00:05:58.060> heat<00:05:58.210> up<00:05:58.240> she<00:05:58.930> got<00:05:59.110> a<00:05:59.170> pulse

00:05:59.670 --> 00:05:59.680 
and this doesn't heat up she got a pulse

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:03.600 
and this doesn't heat up she got a pulse
of<00:05:59.800> 10<00:06:00.520> 10<00:06:01.360> kilohertz<00:06:01.690> through<00:06:02.620> this<00:06:02.830> normally

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:03.610 
of 10 10 kilohertz through this normally

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:07.410 
of 10 10 kilohertz through this normally
normally<00:06:04.060> 12<00:06:04.630> volts<00:06:05.080> at<00:06:05.200> 1<00:06:05.410> amp<00:06:05.620> and<00:06:06.150> if<00:06:07.150> this

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:07.420 
normally 12 volts at 1 amp and if this

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:09.630 
normally 12 volts at 1 amp and if this
collapses<00:06:08.080> then<00:06:08.350> this<00:06:08.590> one<00:06:08.770> kicks<00:06:09.070> in<00:06:09.280> and<00:06:09.520> it

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:09.640 
collapses then this one kicks in and it

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:12.960 
collapses then this one kicks in and it
gives<00:06:09.850> back<00:06:10.320> like<00:06:11.320> 200<00:06:11.830> volts<00:06:12.190> in<00:06:12.340> a<00:06:12.460> Medina

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:12.970 
gives back like 200 volts in a Medina

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:13.530 
gives back like 200 volts in a Medina
style

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:13.540
