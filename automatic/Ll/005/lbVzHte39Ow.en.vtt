 Borussia career match us now 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:28.740
 against paderborn a and let's see 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:35.760
 on what place are they just for the sake of 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:40.530
 interest at least so served born here i am 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:45.920
 I canâ€™t see them 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.920
 total schedule for the match you need to look 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:54.920
 season calendar yes no strange 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:01:01.440
 Bundesliga 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:02.609
 kind of like but something i don't find them here 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:10.460
 in the plate 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:13.260
 and the last place guys 18 place 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:18.030
 playing with a full outsider so 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:20.970
 let's go here the team goes to the field 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:24.420
 friends and here we need three for any 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:28.909
 score point because we play court of pollock ram 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:32.900
 and in all this time the team did not score 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:32.900
 special points so 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:40.670
 In theory, there should be three lungs 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:42.560
 points but since friends are an outsider 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:45.890
 in losing too much and need glasses 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:51.850
 so as not to fly out well here bumblebee 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:51.850
 picking up speed on Ingan 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:02:07.009
 obama yang kandagar again bumblebee 

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:09.019
 filing for obameyang no companies kampale 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:18.980
 out of the penalty good kick but to 

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:23.560
 Sorry not quite accurate a little bit 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:23.560
 the outgoing lapel trajectory flew the ball 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:35.700
 we are i'm marco royce 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.700
 did not get a bit 

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:47.600
 on in kick kick from a good distance today 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.600
 I watch a lot of long shots 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:53.180
 another goal has already been applied 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:02.750
 and I told her 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:02.750
 and here already vaydenfeller 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:11.130
 obameyang but this is a penalty this is a penalty 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:15.090
 friends 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:16.980
 there was no obameyang's leg here 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:19.650
 speech simulation was no longer going on 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:22.220
 swung to blows a lot he just 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:22.220
 dragged off 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:31.310
 well what marco royce who in the past 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:32.500
 olimpiakos match a lot 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:35.830
 penalty 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:35.830
 let's see what now 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:48.700
 marco royce runs up hitting 1110 those 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:49.860
 caress 11 looking at that realized 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:55.740
 we are ahead 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:55.740
 01 friends of course Marco Royce scores 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:03.300
 have a goalkeeper not even jerked and where to him 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:03.300
 twitch 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:17.709
 the company tonin golan friends this 

00:04:12.659 --> 00:04:20.609
 on ingal he famously connected here 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:26.850
 cat attack Obama Yankov 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:26.850
 issued on the course of this immediately 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:38.540
 without any underworking he threw his armpit 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:43.420
 goalkeeper and 02 43 minutes and break 

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:46.400
 friends break score 02 

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:48.470
 let's see who we have there as tired no 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:51.550
 like everything is fine so far 

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:51.550
 further second half 

00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:02.950
 that's dangerous now 

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:05.590
 and one goal wins back otygryvaya owners 

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:08.520
 there is of course our defense somehow 

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:08.520
 parted the whole 

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:20.490
 what looks like ingal's head on only 

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:23.550
 there from the center of the penalty ball to throw on 

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:26.820
 flank Odessa before the penalty here so here 

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:32.420
 See how fast the hosts one goal 

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:38.220
 act out immediately after the break eeeee 

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:40.130
 so you can not play not a yellow card well 

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:43.220
 that marco royce took away with today 

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:48.930
 penalty and now we have 

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:56.610
 free kick on goal bottom goalkeeper 

00:05:48.930 --> 00:06:03.440
 picks up the ball in hand walker obama yang 

00:05:56.610 --> 00:06:03.440
 a shot on goal walter in attack already 

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:12.509
 we lose 

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:17.699
 campagne royce 

00:06:12.509 --> 00:06:19.050
 how did you not get cool rolled out the computer 

00:06:17.699 --> 00:06:21.680
 or but unfortunately by 

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:25.699
 so let's see the pin location on 

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:25.699
 us date blashchikovski 

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:33.020
 depay instead of royce and instead of gene nagano 

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:38.270
 Kagawa will leave us 

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:38.270
 three new players at once 

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:46.870
 we have them from the depot and have a good punch 

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:52.510
 blashchikov applauded him a moment 

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:53.520
 really was a good pity not 

00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:58.440
 hit 

00:06:53.520 --> 00:07:04.800
 easily so flew just a penalty from this 

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:04.800
 shotgun and ball kagawa 

00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:16.880
 how did you not get kagawa and all friends 

00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:19.760
 final whistle 21 on won in 

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:21.650
 In principle, the opponent had one moment 

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:27.770
 they took advantage of the beginning of the second half 

00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:29.900
 scored a goal but it wouldn't help them much 

00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:32.630
 let's honestly say so 

00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:38.020
 strained know what is the team 

00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:45.070
 last place next match we have 

00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:50.450
 will be against menhengladbach 

00:07:45.070 --> 00:07:52.550
 gladwork in general, something like this, I'm not a master 

00:07:50.450 --> 00:07:54.770
 These are the German teams, so 

00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:56.840
