how<00:00:17.039> to<00:00:17.100> do<00:00:17.520> a<00:00:17.550> windmill<00:00:18.060> into<00:00:18.480> a<00:00:18.510> flare<00:00:19.699> do<00:00:20.699> I

00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:21.529 
how to do a windmill into a flare do I

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:24.349 
how to do a windmill into a flare do I
now<00:00:22.529> we're<00:00:22.740> gonna<00:00:22.830> go<00:00:23.070> pick<00:00:23.340> it<00:00:23.369> up<00:00:23.580> a<00:00:23.880> little

bit more all right I'm gonna go through

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.700 
bit more all right I'm gonna go through
two<00:00:26.820> stages<00:00:27.269> all<00:00:27.630> right<00:00:27.720> first<00:00:28.050> stage<00:00:28.320> is<00:00:28.590> how

two stages all right first stage is how

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.910 
two stages all right first stage is how
to<00:00:28.769> do<00:00:29.039> a<00:00:29.070> flare<00:00:29.640> from<00:00:30.510> a<00:00:30.869> tabletop<00:00:31.619> position

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
to do a flare from a tabletop position

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.670 
to do a flare from a tabletop position
or<00:00:32.880> down<00:00:33.270> in<00:00:33.510> a<00:00:33.630> fate<00:00:33.899> kind<00:00:34.170> of<00:00:34.260> like<00:00:34.350> a<00:00:34.380> baby

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
or down in a fate kind of like a baby

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.430 
or down in a fate kind of like a baby
ish<00:00:34.920> position<00:00:35.489> right<00:00:35.809> so<00:00:36.809> we're<00:00:37.140> gonna<00:00:37.230> work

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
ish position right so we're gonna work

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:38.600 
ish position right so we're gonna work
on<00:00:37.620> that<00:00:37.649> real<00:00:38.070> quick

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
on that real quick

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
bunch of different names of different

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.260 
bunch of different names of different
moves<00:00:43.590> and<00:00:44.250> most<00:00:44.460> of<00:00:44.579> you<00:00:44.670> probably<00:00:44.820> like<00:00:45.149> if

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
moves and most of you probably like if

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:46.459 
moves and most of you probably like if
this<00:00:45.360> is<00:00:45.539> your<00:00:45.629> first<00:00:45.840> time<00:00:46.020> seeing<00:00:46.079> this

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
what's a windmill it's a hand glob of

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.240 
what's a windmill it's a hand glob of
law<00:00:51.420> whatever<00:00:51.750> make<00:00:52.590> sure<00:00:52.770> you<00:00:52.890> see<00:00:53.039> the<00:00:53.070> other

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
videos very important all right so we're

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.590 
videos very important all right so we're
gonna<00:00:57.449> be<00:00:57.690> here<00:00:57.989> right<00:00:58.800> here<00:00:59.149> what<00:01:00.149> some<00:01:00.390> of<00:01:00.420> us

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
gonna be here right here what some of us

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.299 
gonna be here right here what some of us
call<00:01:00.719> a<00:01:00.870> tabletop<00:01:01.289> a<00:01:01.680> lot<00:01:01.829> of<00:01:01.920> people<00:01:02.129> might

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
call a tabletop a lot of people might

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.070 
call a tabletop a lot of people might
have<00:01:02.340> different<00:01:02.789> names<00:01:02.910> for<00:01:03.030> it<00:01:03.239> don't<00:01:03.930> get

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
have different names for it don't get

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.940 
have different names for it don't get
mad<00:01:04.260> all<00:01:04.769> right<00:01:04.830> so<00:01:05.430> here<00:01:05.869> right<00:01:06.869> here<00:01:07.140> and

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.380 
mad all right so here right here and
basically<00:01:08.220> we'll<00:01:08.400> do<00:01:08.580> kind<00:01:08.790> of<00:01:08.850> like<00:01:09.030> a<00:01:09.060> hand

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
basically we'll do kind of like a hand

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.230 
basically we'll do kind of like a hand
glide<00:01:09.710> motion<00:01:10.710> and<00:01:11.280> then<00:01:11.430> we're<00:01:11.520> gonna<00:01:11.610> pick

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
glide motion and then we're gonna pick

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.010 
glide motion and then we're gonna pick
up<00:01:12.479> all<00:01:12.630> right

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
up all right

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.010 
up all right
it's<00:01:13.320> very<00:01:13.530> important<00:01:14.420> there<00:01:15.420> you<00:01:15.570> go

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
it's very important there you go

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.050 
it's very important there you go
kind<00:01:16.590> of<00:01:16.680> like<00:01:16.770> a<00:01:16.799> spin<00:01:17.159> you<00:01:17.189> want<00:01:17.400> to<00:01:17.549> get<00:01:17.700> get

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
kind of like a spin you want to get get

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.340 
kind of like a spin you want to get get
momentum<00:01:18.630> on<00:01:18.750> this<00:01:18.869> all<00:01:19.080> right

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
momentum on this all right

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.170 
momentum on this all right
in<00:01:19.619> order<00:01:19.860> for<00:01:20.009> you<00:01:20.070> to<00:01:20.100> get<00:01:20.280> to<00:01:20.310> a<00:01:20.400> flip<00:01:20.729> all

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
in order for you to get to a flip all

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.850 
in order for you to get to a flip all
right<00:01:21.270> someone<00:01:21.540> I'm<00:01:21.720> demonstrated<00:01:22.530> real

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
right someone I'm demonstrated real

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.359 
right someone I'm demonstrated real
quick<00:01:23.100> all<00:01:23.520> right<00:01:23.549> so<00:01:24.150> here<00:01:24.420> speed<00:01:25.020> it<00:01:25.500> up<00:01:25.830> all

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
quick all right so here speed it up all

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.260 
quick all right so here speed it up all
right<00:01:26.490> here<00:01:27.030> spin<00:01:27.630> up<00:01:28.470> to<00:01:28.770> flip<00:01:29.070> all<00:01:29.520> right<00:01:29.640> one

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
right here spin up to flip all right one

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:31.210 
right here spin up to flip all right one
more<00:01:30.509> time

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:31.220 
more time

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:37.550 
more time
do<00:01:32.220> it<00:01:32.360> spin<00:01:34.579> all<00:01:35.579> right<00:01:36.530> practice<00:01:37.530> that

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
do it spin all right practice that

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:38.899 
do it spin all right practice that
that's<00:01:37.920> very<00:01:37.979> important<00:01:38.460> you<00:01:38.490> practice<00:01:38.850> that

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
that's very important you practice that

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.230 
that's very important you practice that
a<00:01:39.210> lot<00:01:39.990> a<00:01:40.320> lot<00:01:40.740> all<00:01:41.130> right<00:01:41.159> you<00:01:41.909> got<00:01:42.000> a<00:01:42.030> mess

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
a lot a lot all right you got a mess

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.060 
a lot a lot all right you got a mess
today<00:01:42.420> all<00:01:43.200> right<00:01:43.380> if<00:01:43.500> you<00:01:43.590> could<00:01:43.740> go<00:01:43.860> back<00:01:44.040> to

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
today all right if you could go back to

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.660 
today all right if you could go back to
a<00:01:45.409> tabletop<00:01:46.409> and<00:01:46.649> then<00:01:46.770> do<00:01:46.890> it<00:01:47.009> again<00:01:47.280> that's

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
a tabletop and then do it again that's

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.280 
a tabletop and then do it again that's
even<00:01:47.880> better<00:01:48.060> so<00:01:48.240> let's<00:01:48.420> let's<00:01:48.899> see<00:01:49.020> me<00:01:49.140> do

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
even better so let's let's see me do

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:49.490 
even better so let's let's see me do
that

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
that

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:55.880 
that
so<00:01:50.100> here<00:01:50.310> spin<00:01:51.240> boom<00:01:52.229> there<00:01:53.270> again<00:01:54.770> all<00:01:55.770> right

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
so here spin boom there again all right

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.069 
so here spin boom there again all right
we<00:01:56.520> got<00:01:56.640> to<00:01:56.729> keep<00:01:56.820> doing<00:01:57.090> it<00:01:57.180> all<00:01:57.360> right<00:01:57.450> you

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
we got to keep doing it all right you

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.499 
we got to keep doing it all right you
can<00:01:58.200> do<00:01:58.259> it<00:01:58.290> sometimes<00:01:58.770> good<00:01:59.340> now<00:02:00.149> let's<00:02:00.420> do

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
can do it sometimes good now let's do

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.090 
can do it sometimes good now let's do
the<00:02:00.630> windmill<00:02:00.990> all<00:02:01.770> right

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
the windmill all right

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.560 
the windmill all right
now<00:02:02.520> this<00:02:02.729> time<00:02:02.909> we're<00:02:03.000> gonna<00:02:03.090> use<00:02:03.240> a<00:02:03.270> head

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
now this time we're gonna use a head

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.410 
now this time we're gonna use a head
there's<00:02:04.200> different<00:02:04.590> ways<00:02:05.090> to<00:02:06.090> get<00:02:06.240> from<00:02:06.360> a

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
there's different ways to get from a

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.089 
there's different ways to get from a
windmill<00:02:06.780> to<00:02:06.990> a<00:02:07.020> flair<00:02:07.320> but<00:02:07.799> I'm<00:02:07.920> going<00:02:08.039> to

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
windmill to a flair but I'm going to
