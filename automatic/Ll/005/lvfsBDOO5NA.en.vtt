00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:15.870
 from the network hello dear, friends and friends 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.359
 Welcome to a new one 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.400
 communio video tutorial today i will 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.900
 the problem feature player 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.390
 disable imagine 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:28.560
 as you often do as a community 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:31.140
 head on administration and then completely 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.989
 down to the active and reactive theirs 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.950
 player 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:37.590
 here you can now any 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.930
 deactivate player attends 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.460
 please that players are in the squad 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.010
 one of your fellow players 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.870
 only then be deactivated when you 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.030
 the computer will be sold and players 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.829
 the ones on the transfer list are for 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.360
 deactivation only from it taken 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.180
 must also be a minimum 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.730
 activated by 40 players at the computer 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.890
 stay over the familiar search mask 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.020
 Now you can look for the players 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.699
 you disable volt in our league 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.799
 For example, we have one 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.570
 determined or the so-called 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.850
 so groups the players with one 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.220
 market value of 160,000 to continue playing 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.729
 because they give us space for more interesting 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:17.270
 take away transfermarkt players on the 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:24.479
 I leave the 160 thousand players to me 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:25.770
 filter out and get the complete 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.250
 I could list every player now 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.780
 select individually 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:33.140
 but it is easier to disable 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.310
 all players to click 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.780
 Now all players are selected and 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:42.810
 I click to confirm on the 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:46.189
 activate players the whole thing i do for 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.189
 the following two pages too 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:54.460
 and all these players became now 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:56.850
 they are deactivated by the computer 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:58.719
 no longer put on the transfermarkt 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.479
 do you want a player of it 

00:01:58.719 --> 00:02:07.390
 reactivate click in the same menu 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:10.479
 reactivation player chooses the player 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:15.030
 off the reactivate volt for example 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:19.209
 wetklo and adele and clicks 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:21.670
 reactivated players these two players 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:25.299
 have now been reactivated which 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:27.370
 Players will disable their volt remains 

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:28.530
 Of course, leave you alone 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:30.900
 for example you can 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:33.730
 Disable long-term injured players 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:36.579
 very cheap or very expensive player 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:38.680
 or even a player of one 

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:39.670
 that's it, that's it 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.230
 again from me 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:43.329
 I hope that I have some of you 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:45.099
 this little feature a bit closer 

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:47.650
 We were able to bring us back 

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:49.810

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:51.250

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:51.879
 Have fun and success in coming 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:54.660
