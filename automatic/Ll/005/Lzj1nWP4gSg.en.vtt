want to have like a safe page I would
say<00:01:06.450> let's<00:01:07.350> go<00:01:07.770> HP<00:01:08.250> scaling<00:01:08.670> NMR<00:01:09.119> okay<00:01:10.110> if<00:01:10.170> you

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
say let's go HP scaling NMR okay if you

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.260 
say let's go HP scaling NMR okay if you
don't<00:01:10.439> have<00:01:10.590> like<00:01:10.830> a<00:01:11.070> ton<00:01:11.610> of<00:01:11.640> room<00:01:11.820> pages<00:01:12.150> like

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
don't have like a ton of room pages like

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.840 
don't have like a ton of room pages like
I<00:01:12.390> do<00:01:12.450> and<00:01:12.750> like<00:01:12.780> all<00:01:13.229> the<00:01:13.350> runes<00:01:13.560> I<00:01:14.280> would<00:01:14.729> just

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
I do and like all the runes I would just

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.690 
I do and like all the runes I would just
go<00:01:15.060> for<00:01:15.210> those<00:01:15.390> and<00:01:15.720> then<00:01:16.439> I<00:01:16.530> do<00:01:16.590> run<00:01:17.009> hybrid

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
go for those and then I do run hybrid

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.560 
go for those and then I do run hybrid
pen<00:01:17.909> rats<00:01:19.670> it's<00:01:20.670> something<00:01:21.030> that<00:01:21.150> everyone

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
pen rats it's something that everyone

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.289 
pen rats it's something that everyone
has<00:01:21.600> like<00:01:21.869> been<00:01:22.860> doing<00:01:23.400> in<00:01:23.520> season<00:01:23.820> 4<00:01:24.030> but<00:01:24.060> I

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
has like been doing in season 4 but I

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.510 
has like been doing in season 4 but I
definitely<00:01:24.780> think<00:01:24.900> it's<00:01:25.080> better<00:01:25.320> than<00:01:25.520> just

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
definitely think it's better than just

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.700 
definitely think it's better than just
straight-up<00:01:26.759> magic<00:01:27.090> pen<00:01:27.439> you<00:01:28.439> get<00:01:28.560> the

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
straight-up magic pen you get the

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.550 
straight-up magic pen you get the
masteries<00:01:29.100> in<00:01:29.220> season<00:01:29.520> 4<00:01:29.700> give<00:01:29.970> both<00:01:30.659> armor

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
masteries in season 4 give both armor

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.170 
masteries in season 4 give both armor
penetration<00:01:31.950> and<00:01:32.280> magic<00:01:32.610> penetration<00:01:32.640> in

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
penetration and magic penetration in

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.620 
penetration and magic penetration in
percentage<00:01:33.750> in<00:01:34.350> offense<00:01:35.310> so<00:01:36.030> I<00:01:36.090> think<00:01:36.390> they're

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
percentage in offense so I think they're

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.539 
percentage in offense so I think they're
just<00:01:36.659> better<00:01:36.990> overall<00:01:37.229> and<00:01:37.560> they<00:01:37.979> they<00:01:38.340> make

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
just better overall and they they make

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:39.859 
just better overall and they they make
your<00:01:38.640> early<00:01:39.000> game<00:01:39.030> tres<00:01:39.360> a<00:01:39.390> lot<00:01:39.659> stronger

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
your early game tres a lot stronger

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.240 
your early game tres a lot stronger
because<00:01:40.140> your<00:01:40.350> autos<00:01:40.680> are<00:01:40.920> actually

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
because your autos are actually

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.580 
because your autos are actually
irrelevant<00:01:41.600> lane<00:01:42.600> the<00:01:43.049> pulse<00:01:43.320> you're<00:01:43.500> only

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
irrelevant lane the pulse you're only

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.649 
irrelevant lane the pulse you're only
dropping<00:01:43.920> out<00:01:44.159> like<00:01:44.189> to<00:01:44.640> magic<00:01:45.090> pen<00:01:45.240> overall

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
dropping out like to magic pen overall

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.630 
dropping out like to magic pen overall
yeah<00:01:46.110> it's<00:01:46.320> like<00:01:46.439> 2.3<00:01:46.979> magic<00:01:47.280> pen<00:01:47.399> and<00:01:47.549> you're

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
yeah it's like 2.3 magic pen and you're

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.510 
yeah it's like 2.3 magic pen and you're
getting<00:01:47.790> 8.1<00:01:48.479> armor<00:01:48.780> pen<00:01:48.960> yeah<00:01:49.590> yeah<00:01:50.280> in<00:01:50.399> the

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
getting 8.1 armor pen yeah yeah in the

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.730 
getting 8.1 armor pen yeah yeah in the
beginning<00:01:50.640> I<00:01:51.119> was<00:01:51.270> like<00:01:51.329> wow<00:01:52.140> I<00:01:52.170> feel<00:01:52.530> like<00:01:52.680> I'm

up<00:02:00.149> excuses<00:02:00.270> but<00:02:00.810> then<00:02:00.930> when<00:02:01.049> I<00:02:01.079> look<00:02:01.320> I<00:02:01.530> look

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
up excuses but then when I look I look

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.709 
up excuses but then when I look I look
between<00:02:02.040> the<00:02:02.280> pros<00:02:02.460> and<00:02:02.640> the<00:02:02.700> cons<00:02:02.729> I<00:02:03.270> it's

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
between the pros and the cons I it's

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.410 
between the pros and the cons I it's
just<00:02:03.899> better<00:02:04.229> overall<00:02:04.880> if<00:02:05.880> you<00:02:06.060> don't<00:02:06.240> have

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
just better overall if you don't have

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.029 
just better overall if you don't have
those<00:02:06.630> they're<00:02:06.960> pretty<00:02:07.229> expensive<00:02:07.469> ruins<00:02:07.890> you

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
those they're pretty expensive ruins you

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.529 
those they're pretty expensive ruins you
can<00:02:08.160> just<00:02:08.280> go<00:02:08.369> from<00:02:08.459> magic<00:02:08.789> pen<00:02:08.970> it's<00:02:09.239> not<00:02:09.390> that

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
can just go from magic pen it's not that

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:10.940 
can just go from magic pen it's not that
big<00:02:09.690> of<00:02:09.720> a<00:02:09.840> difference

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
big of a difference

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.830 
big of a difference
if<00:02:11.490> you<00:02:11.760> just<00:02:11.940> prefer<00:02:12.180> magic<00:02:12.510> pen<00:02:12.630> or<00:02:12.750> wall

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
if you just prefer magic pen or wall

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.830 
if you just prefer magic pen or wall
that's<00:02:13.050> fine<00:02:13.370> they<00:02:14.370> it's<00:02:15.000> not<00:02:15.120> that<00:02:15.450> big<00:02:15.660> of<00:02:15.720> a

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
that's fine they it's not that big of a

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.800 
that's fine they it's not that big of a
difference<00:02:15.960> between<00:02:16.230> the<00:02:16.500> two<00:02:16.650> is<00:02:16.830> okay<00:02:17.810> are

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
difference between the two is okay are

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.360 
difference between the two is okay are
there<00:02:18.960> any<00:02:19.140> other<00:02:19.350> potential<00:02:19.680> alternatives

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
there any other potential alternatives

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.410 
there any other potential alternatives
that<00:02:20.490> we<00:02:20.610> haven't<00:02:20.820> talked<00:02:21.000> about<00:02:22.370> yellow<00:02:23.420> HPD

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
that we haven't talked about yellow HPD

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.930 
that we haven't talked about yellow HPD
scaling<00:02:24.810> arm<00:02:25.170> arm<00:02:25.830> scaling<00:02:26.340> you<00:02:26.490> could<00:02:26.760> even

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
scaling arm arm scaling you could even

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.830 
scaling arm arm scaling you could even
go<00:02:27.210> like<00:02:28.080> flat<00:02:28.410> armor<00:02:28.740> in<00:02:29.070> some<00:02:29.370> cases<00:02:29.690> like<00:02:30.690> I

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
go like flat armor in some cases like I

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:31.970 
go like flat armor in some cases like I
know<00:02:30.930> a<00:02:31.020> lot<00:02:31.260> of<00:02:31.290> people<00:02:31.560> are<00:02:31.650> probably<00:02:31.770> gonna

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
know a lot of people are probably gonna

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.190 
know a lot of people are probably gonna
have<00:02:32.160> flat<00:02:32.430> arm<00:02:32.610> areas<00:02:32.880> over<00:02:33.240> arm<00:02:33.690> is<00:02:33.840> scaling

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
have flat arm areas over arm is scaling

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.480 
have flat arm areas over arm is scaling
so<00:02:34.500> you<00:02:35.010> can<00:02:35.130> go<00:02:35.250> for<00:02:35.400> those<00:02:35.550> too<00:02:36.020> loose<00:02:37.459> like<00:02:38.459> I

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:38.490 
so you can go for those too loose like I

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:42.740 
so you can go for those too loose like I
said<00:02:38.700> Mr<00:02:39.120> and<00:02:39.709> scaling<00:02:40.709> AP<00:02:40.980> pretty<00:02:41.370> much<00:02:41.750> okay

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
said Mr and scaling AP pretty much okay

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.770 
said Mr and scaling AP pretty much okay
cool<00:02:43.640> actually<00:02:44.640> one<00:02:44.760> thing<00:02:44.880> I<00:02:45.030> ran<00:02:45.480> a<00:02:45.510> lot

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
cool actually one thing I ran a lot

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.480 
cool actually one thing I ran a lot
especially<00:02:45.990> back<00:02:46.470> into<00:02:46.740> you<00:02:46.860> was<00:02:47.070> movement

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:47.490 
especially back into you was movement

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:51.140 
especially back into you was movement
speed<00:02:47.670> quints<00:02:48.860> they're<00:02:49.860> very<00:02:50.310> very<00:02:50.580> nice<00:02:50.880> for

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
speed quints they're very very nice for

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.290 
speed quints they're very very nice for
learning<00:02:51.450> syndra<00:02:51.810> since<00:02:52.709> it<00:02:52.830> makes<00:02:53.520> your<00:02:53.970> stun

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 
learning syndra since it makes your stun

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.600 
learning syndra since it makes your stun
a<00:02:54.330> lot<00:02:54.510> easier<00:02:54.780> to<00:02:54.900> land<00:02:55.050> it<00:02:55.320> makes<00:02:55.590> you<00:02:56.250> harder

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
a lot easier to land it makes you harder

winds<00:03:03.360> definitely<00:03:03.780> help<00:03:03.959> I<00:03:04.800> feel<00:03:05.280> like<00:03:05.370> you

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
winds definitely help I feel like you

winds definitely help I feel like you
can<00:03:05.850> start<00:03:06.090> off<00:03:06.239> using<00:03:06.420> mystery<00:03:06.900> quints<00:03:07.140> if

can start off using mystery quints if

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:08.660 
can start off using mystery quints if
you<00:03:07.380> don't<00:03:07.530> feel<00:03:07.680> very<00:03:07.860> comfortable<00:03:08.010> using<00:03:08.340> a

you don't feel very comfortable using a
peak<00:03:08.880> winds<00:03:10.430> if<00:03:11.430> you<00:03:11.670> have<00:03:11.820> them<00:03:12.000> again

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
peak winds if you have them again

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:13.970 
peak winds if you have them again
they're<00:03:12.330> super<00:03:12.570> expensive<00:03:12.780> reasons<00:03:13.230> and<00:03:13.830> then

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
they're super expensive reasons and then

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:15.620 
they're super expensive reasons and then
slowly<00:03:14.310> shift<00:03:14.730> over<00:03:14.880> to<00:03:15.120> a<00:03:15.150> peak<00:03:15.420> winds

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
slowly shift over to a peak winds

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:17.000 
slowly shift over to a peak winds
because<00:03:15.870> they<00:03:15.989> do<00:03:16.049> make<00:03:16.440> your<00:03:16.530> laning<00:03:16.860> face<00:03:16.980> a

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
because they do make your laning face a

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.340 
because they do make your laning face a
lot<00:03:17.130> stronger<00:03:17.370> and<00:03:17.880> they<00:03:18.390> just<00:03:18.570> they<00:03:18.900> do<00:03:18.959> make

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
lot stronger and they just they do make

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:22.070
