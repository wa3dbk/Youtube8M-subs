00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:16.949
 And then beauty can present for you and 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:21.359
 if the polishing mass it serves 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:25.650
 to take it from sean and 202 thousand from 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:28.529
 painting is a very good action of the 3m is a 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:32.489
 very good and very cheap cost mass 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:34.670
 average of 20 to 30 reais and she goes out to 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:39.270
 it can be used as the quina or the hand 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:40.710
 and it is good to take the micro risk of 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:45.360
 so much that she had the risk of 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:47.309
 1200 rainfall and that leaves 2000 and 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.860
 all masses of police 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.420
 it has to be water- based and this is 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.969
 that is the water base 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.710
 this is the most important of the mass of 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:01:00.300
 polishing this is the water base 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.989
 good for the good practice of the part 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.960
 practice 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:12.060
 but speaking I think it's very simple to take 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:16.640
 the carrying of the cotton ball mass a 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.640
 little cotton with 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:39.050
 can always apply a movement 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:43.910
 Circular Never Leaving Any Piece 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:47.410
 otherwise it will make a difference is just 

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:47.410
 a circular motion with application 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:02:00.020
 soon after you can get good soon 

00:01:51.160 --> 00:02:01.850
 100% cotton and cotton 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:05.470
 remembering that one of the things that is 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:08.899
 always very important is the following 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:10.100
 always go alternating the side of the 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:12.860
 cotton when he starts to get 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:15.100
 because there will not be any 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:19.370
 harder you are to withdraw. 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:20.720
 the mass you always make using glove 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:24.920
 because these products they are not 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:28.220
 toxic to the body of the human being but 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:33.670
 anyway to stay with that whore 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:33.670
 strong smell in the hand 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:45.049
 always remembering the car very clean and 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:47.000
 always be able to make a 

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:49.790
 decontamination before doing this 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:55.010
 process without the car dry enough that the 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:59.630
 car is very dry that will happen 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:03:01.820
 will join the police mass with the water 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:04.580
 and once it take there will spread 

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:07.160
 our attitude and then you got it 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:08.510
 spread mass polishing you do not 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.590
 Can you take more out of her? 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:12.880
 difficult 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:16.370
 so always the driest car possible 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:17.480
 this process here with the brand of 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:19.160
 police 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:22.070
 it will remove all risk from the 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:24.860
 painting or at least most of the 

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:26.540
 surface scratches it will remove it 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:29.290
 it is made to remove the dirt from the 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:31.340
 1,200 and 2000 are very deep risks 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:35.290
 that shah there 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:38.350
 she does after a car painting 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:41.209
 well this is a very simple process 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:43.310
 circular movement always the walkway 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:46.180
 with cotton and to remove with cotton 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:46.180
 I think it's very simple
