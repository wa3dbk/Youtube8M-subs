00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.129
 hello dynamic channel friends media on 

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:16.439
 youtube I am going to teach you an important 

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:18.930
 Novelty as you are seeing on screen 

00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:20.279
 this is a galaxy s2 and the version of 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:24.330
 Android that I'm working with is 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:26.570
 android 4.4 kitkat effectively here the 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.570
 we have 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:33.280
 kat kit plate 

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:36.640
 if we keep pressed we see the version 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:39.670
 of android android 4.4 if indeed 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:42.310
 this is a galaxy s2 good so here 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:43.960
 is in the hands of a developer of x 

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:46.719
 from adobe lovers 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:50.010
 and it's about cyanogenmod in its version 

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:55.370
 11 there we have it 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.370
 we have already version number 11 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:01:00.480
 how does this rom work, the truth is 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:02.940
 that I've been using it for a day and a 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.140
 it works great I have to say 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.690
 especially that I was surprised by the 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.030
 battery life for good it has 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:11.400
 I've really liked it a lot 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.080
 of screen so far I have been very 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.570
 well I have not had any failure I have not 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.700
 had no freezing or anything 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.230
 strange although it's not about a 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.330
 final version but from a version of 

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:22.080
 test with which you may have 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.760
 some failure 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.490
 I did not have any personally but 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:28.920
 I know that the forums talk about what has 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.270
 there was some failure of course to be 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.340
 a trial version we can not wait 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.570
 that everything goes perfect with which some 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.310
 failure has to have but I already say that 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.290
 everything important that we can expect 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.660
 of a mobile terminal as it can be 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:42.240
 navigate connect through the 3g 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:44.640
 make calls connect through 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:48.110
 wifi connect bluetooth etc. everything 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.110
 absolutely everything works 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:53.370
 I leave the link of course at the foot 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.230
 of the video so you can read in htc 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:57.390
 mania the thread that has left us a 

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:59.330
 hc mania mate called 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.940
 meaning 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:05.570
 here we are seeing on screen 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:09.660
 the post that he has published and what 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:12.240
 referring to cyanogenmod 11 in which 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.830
 explains how this version is installed what 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:16.710
 is what does not work what is what 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:18.090
 it works above all very attentive to the 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:19.950
 steps of the installation for those 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.840
 that you want to download and install 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:23.790
 because it's a little peculiar 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.590
 Install Google Apps first after 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:28.200
 flash the rom and again install the 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:30.090
 google apps then you have also some 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.580
 tricks to correct a couple of failures 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:34.740
 they have and access to the download 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:37.800
 of both rice and google apps 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:39.420
 and then the reference to the original thread 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.760
 of x by adabel or pers if you want 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:43.530
 visit it and read it of course there will be 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:46.710
 updates there will be new versions 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:48.540
 but this is fully operational and 

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:50.730
 the truth that works very, very, very 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:54.240
 well I have tried practically everything 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:57.050
 what it takes and I have to say it works 

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:57.050
 pretty good 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:04.239
 there we have that the camera works 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.239
 correctly 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:10.180
 and good nothing more to say all 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:12.340
 those who want to try it as I have 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:15.819
 I leave you the direct access with the 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:17.709
 link you have to htc mania to the post of 

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:20.349
 meaning so you can read all the 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:23.560
 information however I in the next 

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:25.870
 video I'll make a demo of how to 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.370
 install it step by step for all 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:30.310
 those who want to see it live 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:34.319

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:34.319
