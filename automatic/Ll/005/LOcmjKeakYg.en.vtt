00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
going to want at least one delay more

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.400 
going to want at least one delay more
the<00:00:29.039> merrier<00:00:29.310> sometimes<00:00:30.199> but<00:00:31.199> you're<00:00:31.320> going

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
to want one that's mix is relatively

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.410 
to want one that's mix is relatively
high<00:00:34.590> and<00:00:35.010> that<00:00:35.219> the<00:00:35.340> repeats<00:00:35.790> are<00:00:36.000> set<00:00:36.239> pretty

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
high and that the repeats are set pretty

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.209 
high and that the repeats are set pretty
high<00:00:36.540> on<00:00:36.870> you<00:00:37.440> don't<00:00:37.710> want<00:00:37.920> to<00:00:38.010> start

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
high on you don't want to start

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.160 
high on you don't want to start
oscillating<00:00:38.550> your<00:00:39.360> delay<00:00:39.660> pedal<00:00:40.020> though

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
oscillating your delay pedal though

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.900 
oscillating your delay pedal though
because<00:00:40.440> then<00:00:40.829> you<00:00:40.950> are<00:00:40.980> no<00:00:41.250> longer<00:00:41.579> in

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
because then you are no longer in

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.080 
because then you are no longer in
control<00:00:42.329> of<00:00:42.750> your<00:00:43.530> path<00:00:43.770> so<00:00:44.579> you<00:00:44.670> want<00:00:44.879> to<00:00:44.940> keep

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
control of your path so you want to keep

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.660 
control of your path so you want to keep
it<00:00:45.329> within<00:00:45.989> reason<00:00:46.289> to<00:00:46.620> where<00:00:46.770> you<00:00:46.980> can<00:00:47.160> be<00:00:47.340> in

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
it within reason to where you can be in

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:53.299 
it within reason to where you can be in
control<00:00:48.649> then<00:00:49.649> the<00:00:50.300> magic<00:00:51.300> is<00:00:51.570> in<00:00:52.140> the<00:00:52.680> Strymon

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
control then the magic is in the Strymon

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.299 
control then the magic is in the Strymon
blue<00:00:53.610> sky<00:00:53.910> there's<00:00:54.329> several<00:00:55.140> reverb<00:00:55.890> pedals

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
blue sky there's several reverb pedals

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.729 
blue sky there's several reverb pedals
that<00:00:56.430> can<00:00:56.730> really<00:00:56.910> do<00:00:57.059> a<00:00:57.090> great<00:00:57.480> like<00:00:57.750> infinite

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
that can really do a great like infinite

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.510 
that can really do a great like infinite
sustain<00:00:59.120> sounding<00:01:00.120> reverb<00:01:01.020> but<00:01:01.350> I<00:01:01.500> prefer<00:01:01.920> the

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
sustain sounding reverb but I prefer the

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.679 
sustain sounding reverb but I prefer the
blue<00:01:02.730> sky<00:01:03.000> I<00:01:03.300> have<00:01:03.750> it<00:01:03.870> set<00:01:04.140> to<00:01:04.170> mod<00:01:05.060> reverb<00:01:06.060> and

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
blue sky I have it set to mod reverb and

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.380 
blue sky I have it set to mod reverb and
then<00:01:06.990> on<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.290> plate<00:01:07.619> my<00:01:08.159> decay<00:01:08.610> is<00:01:08.909> all<00:01:09.210> the

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
then on the plate my decay is all the

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.980 
then on the plate my decay is all the
way<00:01:09.510> up<00:01:09.780> these<00:01:10.350> damps<00:01:11.280> are<00:01:12.000> all<00:01:12.210> the<00:01:12.330> way<00:01:12.450> up<00:01:12.689> I

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
way up these damps are all the way up I

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.230 
way up these damps are all the way up I
don't<00:01:13.110> have<00:01:13.350> any<00:01:13.530> pre<00:01:13.740> delay<00:01:14.070> and<00:01:14.400> your<00:01:14.970> mix

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
don't have any pre delay and your mix

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.649 
don't have any pre delay and your mix
depending<00:01:15.810> on<00:01:15.930> how<00:01:16.369> much<00:01:17.369> infinite<00:01:18.150> sustain

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
depending on how much infinite sustain

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.719 
depending on how much infinite sustain
you<00:01:18.840> want<00:01:19.080> can<00:01:19.409> be<00:01:19.439> anywhere<00:01:19.799> this<00:01:20.340> is<00:01:20.520> not<00:01:20.700> a
