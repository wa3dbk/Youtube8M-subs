00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:07.529
 another heaven literally from a construction site i 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.300
 I know that these scenes cause you 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:12.719
 huge interest why because everything 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:14.429
 it concerns probably those who so or 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.170
 otherwise face your home this or that 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:20.400
 another stage today advice to touch 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:22.350
 floors in particular laying laminate 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.170
 you need to ensure it does not creak 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.420
 so that he is not lost because I 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.609
 I understand the biggest discount 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.640
 It is passed in mounting points and 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:36.270
 at the time of preparation as for the sexes 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:39.510
 this is the floor level that is the floor level 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:42.059
 should be displayed in this case in 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.370
 this apartment we did a screed that is 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:47.190
 screed is shot off initially 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:50.100
 the laser level shows the hall 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.809
 which shows the differential drop 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.660
 exactly 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:57.690
 of our gender its curvature we it 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.969
 We take into account for the calculation of materials and 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:03.390
 Further we begin to level this floor 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.379
 that is, there are two types of cement 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:08.340
 sticking 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:10.500
 food sticking on the case when we have 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.260
 the drop is very big about 10 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:16.590
 centimeters here and the next one so 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:18.119
 goes before the finish it 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.810
 laying yusb 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:25.799
 this is extruded material from so 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:29.250
 called wood shavings and sawdust 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:31.380
 fractions with oily alkyl 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:35.670
 all sorts of materials in which 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:37.500
 is in this case a heater so I 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.540
 I see literally under my feet and ceilings 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:44.399
 the garden here are these gaps 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:46.590
 this is this little secret so we will 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:49.530
 speak which is necessary precisely in 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.850
 our work that is all the materials in 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.340
 particular in the hut 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.430
 it is a natural material even though it is not 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:59.960
 artificially collected by human hands 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:03.049
 i.e. off season temperature factor 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:05.060
 winter-summer these materials are gaining 

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:07.780
 moisture in itself that is, it is mobile 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:10.970
 if we don't do these so-called 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:13.220
 Thermage you as we call them 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:14.140
 simply this again sheet on 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.600
 the sheet will be 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:19.340
 push in and again quite right then 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:22.670
 there is this movement that we have 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:26.750
 appears in these moments with the weather with 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:29.270
 the atmosphere and we have no effect again 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:31.190
 the movement of the floors and creak and all sorts of 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:34.700
 then this roll is clear 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:37.400
 it means it is foamed to move on it 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:40.489
 creates again an airbag like 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:42.680
 he is also like that 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:45.260
 material because we have laminate 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:47.510
 again alive he's going to call 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.670
 here is the spring material we are again this 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:51.830
 little air pad and if in 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:52.310
 if we lay it on concrete 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:54.920
 the floors 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:57.980
 the most important thing here is the question after all why 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:00.800
 some people hesitate say that 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:03.410
 laminate here it here it is not a hollow pillar 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:06.980
 here is your personal relationship as you know 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:08.720
 I really love Amina because we 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:11.090
 Of course we always talk about quality 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:13.070
 materials and brand quality 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:16.010
 materials that provides us 

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:17.720
 shopping complex armada i'm not talking about 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:19.549
 fake options because and to 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:22.010
 Unfortunately, too much and in general 

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:25.160
 branded laminate with proper installation 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:27.739
 Serves long enough 10 years without 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:30.440
 problems that is, we have already said that if 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:32.810
 properly leveled floor ie locks 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:34.700
 won't get hurt won't break and we don't 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:37.220
 There will be this effect for grated on 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:38.090
 drawing is one second when choosing 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:40.670
 laminate flooring 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:43.070
 try to lorg the so-called or 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:47.600
 waxing it's very 

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:50.120
 the decorative part of the tree was still in 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:52.100
 including the seams of this laminate 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:54.320
 it will protect you in case 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:56.450
 let's say you have some kind of palm tree or 

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:58.549
 ficus on the deck blurted out a flower 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:01.280
 water just ran a little water 

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:03.500
 hit the stack of this laminate then she 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:05.710
 Also, in no case will not swell at 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:07.420
 small amount of water well 

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:09.970
 summarizing our today's educational program on 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:11.740
 repair want to say probably worth 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:13.870
 when repairing rely on two things 

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:17.140
 buy quality materials and 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:18.970
 trust experts or not to allow 

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:20.200
 mistakes if you do this repair yourself 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:23.520
 for this there is our program 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:23.520
 listen carefully advice
