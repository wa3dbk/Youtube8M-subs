00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
that the muscles of your lower body have

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.470 
that the muscles of your lower body have
to<00:01:01.109> decelerate<00:01:01.680> and<00:01:02.129> slow<00:01:02.670> you<00:01:02.730> down<00:01:03.000> versus

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
to decelerate and slow you down versus

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.590

landing<00:01:04.320> and<00:01:04.500> then<00:01:05.280> squatting<00:01:05.820> so<00:01:06.330> I'd<00:01:06.450> like

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
landing and then squatting so I'd like

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.120 
landing and then squatting so I'd like
you<00:01:06.750> to<00:01:06.840> land<00:01:07.049> nice<00:01:07.680> and<00:01:08.010> deep<00:01:09.830> it's<00:01:10.830> easier<00:01:11.100> on

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
you to land nice and deep it's easier on

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.010 
you to land nice and deep it's easier on
the<00:01:11.220> joints<00:01:11.310> so<00:01:12.030> more<00:01:12.240> stress<00:01:12.540> goes<00:01:12.750> to<00:01:12.930> the

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
the joints so more stress goes to the

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.690 
the joints so more stress goes to the
muscles<00:01:13.380> that's<00:01:13.799> one<00:01:14.100> key<00:01:14.310> with<00:01:14.460> most

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
muscles that's one key with most

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.510 
muscles that's one key with most

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
plyometric type of exercises this is one

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:36.630 
plyometric type of exercises this is one
of<00:02:34.780> the<00:02:34.930> most<00:02:35.140> intense<00:02:35.560> anaerobic<00:02:36.100> exercises

when<00:02:43.000> we<00:02:43.060> talk<00:02:43.210> about<00:02:43.240> exercise<00:02:43.750> that<00:02:43.900> the<00:02:43.990> an

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
when we talk about exercise that the an

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:46.650 
when we talk about exercise that the an
aerobic<00:02:44.770> interval<00:02:45.070> sprint<00:02:46.030> type<00:02:46.240> of<00:02:46.420> training

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660 
aerobic interval sprint type of training

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:49.440 
aerobic interval sprint type of training
is<00:02:46.870> really<00:02:47.790> profoundly<00:02:48.790> effective<00:02:49.300> for

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
is really profoundly effective for

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:51.810 
is really profoundly effective for
building<00:02:49.870> cardiovascular<00:02:50.620> fitness<00:02:50.860> far

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:51.820

superior<00:02:52.570> in<00:02:52.900> many<00:02:52.930> ways<00:02:53.260> to<00:02:53.440> aerobic

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:53.830 
superior in many ways to aerobic

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:55.440 
superior in many ways to aerobic
training<00:02:54.040> so<00:02:54.370> if<00:02:54.460> you<00:02:54.550> can<00:02:54.670> do<00:02:54.790> a<00:02:54.820> few<00:02:55.090> reps<00:02:55.120> of

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
training so if you can do a few reps of

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:56.940 
training so if you can do a few reps of
this<00:02:55.630> you're<00:02:56.170> really<00:02:56.410> making<00:02:56.650> some<00:02:56.800> good

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
this you're really making some good

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:58.440 
this you're really making some good
progress<00:02:57.160> and<00:02:57.520> it's<00:02:57.760> a<00:02:57.820> completely<00:02:58.209> different

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 
progress and it's a completely different

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:01.949 
progress and it's a completely different
exercise<00:02:59.520> than<00:03:00.520> typical<00:03:01.150> cardio<00:03:01.600> training

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:01.959 
exercise than typical cardio training

but you're really going to get your

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:05.220 
but you're really going to get your
heart<00:03:03.130> rate<00:03:03.280> up<00:03:03.310> there<00:03:03.610> and<00:03:03.760> it's<00:03:04.060> a<00:03:04.180> it's<00:03:04.630> very

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
heart rate up there and it's a it's very

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.530 
heart rate up there and it's a it's very
similar<00:03:05.530> in<00:03:05.740> many<00:03:05.860> ways<00:03:06.010> to<00:03:06.580> sprinting<00:03:07.390> and

advantages we just talked about it stay

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.090 
advantages we just talked about it stay
on<00:03:15.310> a<00:03:15.430> video<00:03:15.790> and<00:03:16.060> you<00:03:16.989> burn<00:03:17.140> more<00:03:17.350> fat<00:03:17.620> your

future<00:03:19.720> more<00:03:20.200> time<00:03:20.440> efficient<00:03:20.980> it's<00:03:21.190> fun<00:03:21.459> so

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.120 
future more time efficient it's fun so

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:25.259 
future more time efficient it's fun so
it's<00:03:22.239> a<00:03:22.269> great<00:03:22.480> way<00:03:22.630> to<00:03:22.660> go<00:03:22.930> so<00:03:23.620> this<00:03:24.070> is<00:03:24.280> a<00:03:24.310> one

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:25.269 
it's a great way to go so this is a one

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:26.520 
it's a great way to go so this is a one
of<00:03:25.300> the<00:03:25.390> best<00:03:25.450> examples<00:03:26.019> of<00:03:26.050> that<00:03:26.110> I'm

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.530
