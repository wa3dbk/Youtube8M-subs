00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:04.380
 hello guys welcome back to an unboxing 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.839
 it was after it did n't happen today 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.760
 obviously as you can see very well 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:10.170
 from the writing we open fifa 15 this 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.820
 clown looks for a cock because he doesn't have the 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.049
 my 

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:14.969
 here is my edition instead 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.070
 the last team edition then the one 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.840
 will give us a little packet 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.119
 bones I don't know exactly now 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.650
 how it works then i will open and see it 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.330
 directly here with you if written 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.550
 success the code no we see also the 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.310
 back of this beautiful steelbook that 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.420
 le bar code was attached 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.769
 weapons I recommend to frame it well 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.300
 let's review it for a moment 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:37.110
 just beautiful beautiful and well done a 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.879
 starting from the one to zoom and nothing for 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.230
 more he said there will be ance 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.100
 even a well-known design there is a tube 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.500
 anything 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.300
 however the TV series from which I have 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.829
 realized there was even put 9 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.379
 this one from karina is fine 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:53.640
 we instead take a look at the field 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:55.620
 game for ends is here put you medicine 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.140
 more than up to 40 gold packages of 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.309
 food 15 for 40 weeks and her but if 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.719
 how he played in the drawer for five 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.129
 matches and therefore certainly sets more 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.680
 various objects such as cities in catalogs 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.299
 and sport future club so now don't 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.400
 I know I think you will see it even for a little while 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:10.200
 once the months of what will come 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.200
 released celestial content more 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.159
 which maybe are exclusive considered 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.540
 who did n't even take season pass 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.400
 last year for a while groping in the 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.619
 dark 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.390
 a bit like trying to open up to you 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.610
 block the strip for we start challenge 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.130
 personal between the professional seas 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:31.170
 if he failed to win me instead 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:33.930
 I take the clouds out and see if we can 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:36.570
 they are sight codes I would say no 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:39.509
 so much if you want to make a secret but 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.670
 pure steelbook but so here it is on 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.950
 sector 40 packages now gold by fifa 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.750
 ultimate team aqua there is the code and then 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.159
 there is code to have the 5 george cannot 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.610
 allowed so we can't 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:53.850
 show almost carl drews becomes one 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.960
 I think I am still having a vomit crisis 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.810
 each chooses so much of the new ones 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.340
 advertising receives a package 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.930
 free initial 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.479
 thing that notes the site among other things yes 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.579
 can also do offline mode with 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.649
 the web app from sky I don't know if I can 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:09.050
 record it in here instead then there was 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:12.260
 what kind contents 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:14.030
 the michael support then used to a 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:16.910
 part of the game there is no tube of anything 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:18.470
 health warnings so if there is 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:21.050
 something is there but I can't do it 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:23.990
 see for obvious reasons why I need it 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:26.330
 it's like they can this way 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:28.340
 see for now we see a game then 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:30.740
 will surely make some little videos but 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.480
 I did this for the end of fifa 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:35.030
 once we go for time we leave immediately 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.830
 if we don't arrive last after ea 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:40.090
 monsters ends here we are in that 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:40.090
 next video hi guys
