opponents<00:00:58.320> that<00:00:58.379> we<00:00:58.500> could<00:00:58.680> play<00:00:58.859> in<00:00:59.039> the<00:00:59.129> big

opponents that we could play in the big

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.520 
opponents that we could play in the big
east<00:00:59.520> we<00:00:59.730> did<00:00:59.910> not<00:01:00.059> have<00:01:00.300> a<00:01:00.329> a<00:01:00.780> structured

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
east we did not have a a structured

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.799 
east we did not have a a structured
league<00:01:01.800> schedule<00:01:02.100> so<00:01:02.489> we<00:01:02.609> scheduled<00:01:03.030> all<00:01:03.210> 20

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
league schedule so we scheduled all 20

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.960 
league schedule so we scheduled all 20
dual<00:01:03.989> matches<00:01:04.260> throughout<00:01:05.159> the<00:01:05.309> season<00:01:05.700> so<00:01:05.909> it

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
dual matches throughout the season so it

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.520 
dual matches throughout the season so it
was<00:01:06.090> essentially<00:01:06.689> all<00:01:06.900> out<00:01:07.170> of<00:01:07.320> conference

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
was essentially all out of conference

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.609 
was essentially all out of conference
this<00:01:08.520> now<00:01:08.790> obviously<00:01:09.210> adds<00:01:09.540> 11<00:01:10.470> matches

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
this now obviously adds 11 matches

challenge of work in the face in the ACC

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.789 
challenge of work in the face in the ACC
is<00:01:29.250> the<00:01:29.700> fact<00:01:29.970> that<00:01:30.240> many<00:01:31.049> of<00:01:31.140> those<00:01:31.409> schools

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
is the fact that many of those schools

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.179 
is the fact that many of those schools
are<00:01:32.130> located<00:01:32.280> in<00:01:32.640> climates<00:01:33.350> far<00:01:34.350> more<00:01:34.650> far

located that's a that's going to be a

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:42.319 
located that's a that's going to be a
big<00:01:39.329> factor<00:01:39.540> is<00:01:39.930> going<00:01:40.170> to<00:01:40.259> be<00:01:40.640> how<00:01:41.640> we<00:01:41.700> handle

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
big factor is going to be how we handle

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.990 
big factor is going to be how we handle
being<00:01:42.990> able<00:01:43.320> to<00:01:43.470> play<00:01:43.740> go<00:01:44.430> from<00:01:44.640> indoors

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
in our Big East schedule is a lot more

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.350 
in our Big East schedule is a lot more
is<00:01:55.649> lot<00:01:55.829> greater<00:01:56.040> so<00:01:56.310> when<00:01:56.460> we<00:01:56.549> get<00:01:56.700> into<00:01:56.850> ACC

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
is lot greater so when we get into ACC

is lot greater so when we get into ACC
regular<00:01:57.390> season<00:01:58.079> play<00:01:58.320> the<00:01:59.159> majority<00:01:59.549> of<00:01:59.579> that

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
regular season play the majority of that
