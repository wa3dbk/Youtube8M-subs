00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
pot let's get the plot out of the way so

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:13.339 
pot let's get the plot out of the way so
pretty<00:00:11.639> much<00:00:11.759> it<00:00:11.940> takes<00:00:12.059> in<00:00:12.210> a<00:00:12.300> medieval<00:00:12.570> tight

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
pretty much it takes in a medieval tight

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.470 
pretty much it takes in a medieval tight
fantasy<00:00:13.950> universe<00:00:14.280> of<00:00:14.580> the<00:00:14.670> ancient<00:00:15.089> I<00:00:15.179> guess

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
fantasy universe of the ancient I guess

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.840 
fantasy universe of the ancient I guess
European<00:00:15.990> type<00:00:16.139> days<00:00:16.410> and<00:00:16.770> we<00:00:17.310> have<00:00:17.490> our<00:00:17.640> main

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
European type days and we have our main

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.269 
European type days and we have our main
female<00:00:18.180> character<00:00:18.810> Nikki<00:00:19.230> a<00:00:19.380> princess<00:00:20.130> of

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
female character Nikki a princess of

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.460 
female character Nikki a princess of
this<00:00:20.430> like<00:00:20.609> I<00:00:20.760> guess<00:00:20.970> country<00:00:21.539> Kingdom<00:00:22.289> is

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
this like I guess country Kingdom is

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.710 
this like I guess country Kingdom is
like<00:00:23.070> she<00:00:23.400> can<00:00:23.550> control<00:00:23.789> air<00:00:24.029> and<00:00:24.240> water<00:00:24.449> make

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
like she can control air and water make

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.019 
like she can control air and water make
it<00:00:24.840> rain<00:00:25.080> anywhere<00:00:25.560> she<00:00:25.740> wants<00:00:26.189> and<00:00:26.340> so<00:00:26.789> she's

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
it rain anywhere she wants and so she's

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:28.609 
it rain anywhere she wants and so she's
going<00:00:27.210> to<00:00:27.420> this<00:00:27.510> other<00:00:27.750> major<00:00:28.050> country<00:00:28.500> like

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
going to this other major country like

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.160 
going to this other major country like
the<00:00:28.740> Sun<00:00:29.039> King<00:00:29.400> to<00:00:29.820> marry<00:00:30.240> him<00:00:30.630> that's<00:00:31.050> the

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
the Sun King to marry him that's the

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:32.959 
the Sun King to marry him that's the
major<00:00:31.500> goal<00:00:31.890> what<00:00:32.040> I<00:00:32.070> see<00:00:32.250> from<00:00:32.430> this<00:00:32.579> episode

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
major goal what I see from this episode

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.220 
major goal what I see from this episode
but<00:00:33.090> I<00:00:33.149> don't<00:00:33.390> think<00:00:33.540> that's<00:00:33.660> the<00:00:33.809> actual<00:00:33.989> end

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
but I don't think that's the actual end

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.440 
but I don't think that's the actual end
goal<00:00:34.410> in<00:00:34.559> mind<00:00:34.770> but<00:00:35.370> most<00:00:35.670> likely<00:00:36.059> she's<00:00:36.239> going

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
goal in mind but most likely she's going

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:37.549 
goal in mind but most likely she's going
to<00:00:36.510> come<00:00:36.660> to<00:00:36.750> this<00:00:36.840> country<00:00:37.020> to<00:00:37.290> be<00:00:37.350> able<00:00:37.440> to

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
have all around the best animation I've

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.000 
have all around the best animation I've
ever<00:00:54.510> seen<00:00:54.750> it<00:00:55.230> once<00:00:55.469> again<00:00:55.770> is<00:00:55.890> a<00:00:55.920> very

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
ever seen it once again is a very

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.040 
ever seen it once again is a very
average<00:00:56.760> animation<00:00:57.360> quality<00:00:57.750> from<00:00:57.899> this

anime season but I feel like it does

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.990 
anime season but I feel like it does
stand<00:01:01.199> out<00:01:01.559> just<00:01:02.190> because<00:01:02.489> a<00:01:02.520> lot<00:01:02.699> of<00:01:02.910> the

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
stand out just because a lot of the

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.030 
stand out just because a lot of the
animation<00:01:03.270> reminds<00:01:03.809> me<00:01:04.019> of<00:01:04.110> Romeo<00:01:04.470> Juliet

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040

that series it really reminds me with

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.130 
that series it really reminds me with
the<00:01:08.549> actual<00:01:08.880> visual<00:01:09.270> art<00:01:09.479> quality<00:01:09.960> I'll<00:01:10.049> know

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
the poorer people instead of always just

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.560 
the poorer people instead of always just
looking<00:01:43.829> at<00:01:43.950> the<00:01:44.070> nobles<00:01:44.460> but<00:01:44.939> we<00:01:45.119> see<00:01:45.270> another
