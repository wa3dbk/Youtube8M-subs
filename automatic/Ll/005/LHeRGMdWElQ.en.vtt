00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:12.770
 welcome to a new one 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:15.110
 edition of the terminal building block lyric and ok 

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:17.119
 you can give that quite the 

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:19.369
 claim these videos synonymous for and 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:21.560
 just to produce adults and 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:21.830
 why am I putting a close said now 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:23.890
 in front 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:25.850
 which I know for him 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:27.859
 one and a half years to five years old 

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:29.840
 directed far that we somehow completely 

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:33.140
 cuddly finds that's the colorful 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:34.970
 as fun and even now the one 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:38.090
 Slowly again cooler season can 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:40.420
 So you are almost your own 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:43.340
 then even low-calorie 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:44.840
 put together because the things you can 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:46.250
 not swallowed that's why because 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.840
 you just everything a little bigger 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:50.059
 maybe a few more 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.440
 hints weak is now duplo like 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:53.300
 said that is the turn for the 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.399
 a little younger when I'm very young 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:58.219
 this is the entry-level drug, so to speak 

00:00:55.399 --> 00:01:00.350
 into the world of neo set with it one becomes 

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:03.110
 hooked and what we now 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:05.020
 just pick out 24 parts of 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:07.640
 remember already are much bigger but 

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:09.590
 Almost everything from duplo can be synonymous 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:12.560
 afterwards with the normal little lego 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:15.770
 stones that connect the corresponding ones 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.880
 gaps and holes are enough 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:19.070
 that they fit together then 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.590
 appeared left all year 2014 for 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:23.750
 just under 15 euros 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:25.939
 and if that is then out of the pack 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:28.549
 We'll get there immediately 

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:31.520
 almost the water is running in one year 

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:32.840
 munde along the line on violent 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.490
 By the way, what we see here is more like that 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.950
 as an excitation to understand 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.450
 so you also know what sorts like 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:42.259
 here, for example, should have that 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:44.270
 probably be orange that here that is then 

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:46.250
 strawberry with probably a 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:49.220
 share certain cream or yogurt 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:51.740
 that's why the white that could do this 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:54.079
 not identifying is blue schlumpfs 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:57.320
 perhaps you can also be 

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:58.790
 in any case beautiful blue as well as 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:01.189
 this is a bit harder for me to do 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:02.899
 recognize this is pistachio or 

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:04.430
 anyway somehow looks with her 

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:06.290
 has me in lust out there in the 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:08.810
 Guidance with what's green really 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:10.640
 for me for the stars was her turn and 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:13.160
 nothing brings the way that taste all 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:15.380
 to nix the vanilla is also the only 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.000
 outwardly not from the taste so 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:17.860
 do not confuse and then we have 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.080
 here still 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:21.970
 The chocolate almost looks like it when you are 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:25.030
 smoked on the duplo stones 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:26.800
 but is actually only printed and 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:28.660
 Today, no ice will be without 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:31.150
 topic posted that's why we can 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:33.640
 also nice whipped cream on it 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:35.320
 we see that here or if it is 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:37.030
 because something should be fruity 

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:39.670
 then we would have there soon 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:41.830
 the corresponding blackberry but first 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:43.450
 Here are the waffle bags to discover 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:46.000
 also of course plastic please 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.959
 not pure white or for the water 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.310
 the style 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:49.570
 we can already see that on the 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:51.730
 figure and we will soon 

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:54.070
 to replicate the living object 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:55.300
 By the way, the blackberries we ourselves 

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:58.060
 can still do something for that 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:59.590
 healthier ice but healthy that can yes 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:01.239
 We all just do something 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:04.480
 colored here so a little something 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:06.670
 family what pinkls what oranges is and 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.470
 already we have the water ice in three 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:10.150
 different flavors plus 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:12.070
 something else ruth in the back 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:13.209
 or if we want we can 

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:15.450
 of course also his on it 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:17.709
 we already have the water ice cream with cream 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:19.600
 then somehow there is no water left 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:21.880
 but makes nothing immediately again 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:25.420
 disassemble we pack now 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:27.010
 So what, here is the basis 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:29.019
 put it then the corresponding 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:30.730
 beads because it classes as from which it 

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:33.100
 first vanilla on it you can see 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:34.540
 that fits logically and is just 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:36.190
 especially good for smaller ends 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:37.180
 suitable but I find myself as 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:39.220
 adult does that as said 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:40.720
 Somehow what her so no idea 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:42.549
 why I now appeals to as 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:44.440
 other duplo that has nothing, of course 

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:46.870
 to do with me but I found that like 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:47.950
 said quite funny diploma by the way 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:50.500
 while I'm here again a bit 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:52.900
 ice together is put in the ratio 2 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:55.510
 designed to 1 that is normal duplo 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:58.239
 stones are twice as big as those 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:59.950
 normal legos because of everything 

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:02.560
 somehow is the relationship fits the 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:03.850
 then together and what you do 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:06.730
 perhaps can mention again 

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:09.010
 duplo did not exist for two years 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:10.299
 because it has always been successful 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:12.160
 never quite as successful of course again 

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:15.690
 the big normal lego rather small 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:18.850
 But you still have the idea in 2002 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:21.280
 that is no longer somehow so what 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:22.690
 one believes children can sell 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:24.370
 although somehow it was still sold 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:27.020
 that is why it has been renamed lego 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:28.759
 explorer then there was practically only 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:30.470
 chronicle also it has but 

00:04:28.759 --> 00:04:32.870
 lego not enforced at all 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:34.370
 allegedly almost before the bankruptcy 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:36.889
 and here we see a huge egg 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:38.629
 stadel not so nice at lego bands 

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:39.409
 somehow collapsing it's just one 

00:04:38.629 --> 00:04:41.300
 Challenge 

00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:44.180
 yes, but that's why you have one 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:45.889
 better prudent and besides also at 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:47.210
 other lego series there I would be 

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:50.090
 Maybe no human being 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:52.159
 then you have just in 2004 the expedition too 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:54.770
 lego explorer quits and gives since then 

00:04:52.159 --> 00:04:56.539
 it is again lego duplo meanwhile by the way 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:58.940
 I saw in the shop , he already moved 

00:04:56.539 --> 00:05:00.650
 also with themes such as batman 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:01.940
 but also that another topic during 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:04.639
 I ever more again 

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:06.440
 two-fold compilation in the 

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:07.940
 reality probably difficult so too 

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:10.789
 get and produce 

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:11.960
 But nothing makes doblo there is that and 

00:05:10.789 --> 00:05:14.840
 then a little something for that 

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:17.680
 line namely the blow cream on top 

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:19.940
 and then in the waffle 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:21.500
 Herzallerliebst I think I have to 

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:23.419
 right back to the local italian 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:24.889
 but first this video 

00:05:23.419 --> 00:05:26.090
 Short ends are for example here 

00:05:24.889 --> 00:05:28.009
 again the instructions short 

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:29.479
 flipped I say yes that is 

00:05:28.009 --> 00:05:31.159
 of course, rather an excitation with it 

00:05:29.479 --> 00:05:33.860
 have children 's idea like the one with the 

00:05:31.159 --> 00:05:35.030
 other than matches if you 

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:36.409
 of course you can also completely 

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:38.569
 put the things together differently and 

00:05:36.409 --> 00:05:41.479
 Of course the obligatory advertising for 

00:05:38.569 --> 00:05:43.729
 other assets so who has children and 

00:05:41.479 --> 00:05:45.349
 They may be hot then you can do this here 

00:05:43.729 --> 00:05:47.509
 ever shake hands 

00:05:45.349 --> 00:05:49.159
 Maybe that 's not a real thing 

00:05:47.509 --> 00:05:51.160
 is not that disappointed and big 

00:05:49.159 --> 00:05:53.479
 and otherwise 

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:54.979
 that 's it for today with the klempau 

00:05:53.479 --> 00:05:56.870
 steinbrück the next series lattice 

00:05:54.979 --> 00:05:58.430
 again with many small stones 

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:59.900
 that will be in a few days already 

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:02.710
 his all are looking forward to it 

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:02.710
 thing here 

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:13.060
 in front
