00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:49.210 
the game play first so we develop the

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:51.030 
the game play first so we develop the
mechanic<00:00:49.660> and<00:00:49.810> we<00:00:49.900> really<00:00:50.170> really<00:00:50.200> busted<00:00:50.950> our

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:51.040 
mechanic and we really really busted our

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:52.260 
mechanic and we really really busted our
asses<00:00:51.190> to<00:00:51.490> figure<00:00:51.730> out<00:00:51.820> what<00:00:52.000> would<00:00:52.090> be<00:00:52.180> the

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:52.270 
asses to figure out what would be the

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:54.450 
asses to figure out what would be the
best<00:00:52.450> type<00:00:52.750> of<00:00:52.780> setting<00:00:53.170> to<00:00:53.350> fill<00:00:53.770> it<00:00:53.920> I

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:54.460 
best type of setting to fill it I

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:56.190 
best type of setting to fill it I
originally<00:00:55.000> penned<00:00:55.420> the<00:00:55.570> idea<00:00:55.840> while<00:00:56.020> I<00:00:56.050> was

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:56.200 
originally penned the idea while I was

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.290 
originally penned the idea while I was
in<00:00:56.350> Leo<00:00:56.560> and<00:00:56.950> France<00:00:57.250> so<00:00:57.910> a<00:00:57.940> lot<00:00:58.150> of<00:00:58.180> the

00:00:58.290 --> 00:00:58.300 
in Leo and France so a lot of the

00:00:58.300 --> 00:00:59.819 
in Leo and France so a lot of the
architecture<00:00:58.840> that<00:00:58.989> we<00:00:59.110> built<00:00:59.350> from<00:00:59.470> it<00:00:59.650> came

00:00:59.819 --> 00:00:59.829 
architecture that we built from it came

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:01.590 
architecture that we built from it came
from<00:00:59.890> that<00:01:00.160> city<00:01:00.430> actually<00:01:00.670> that<00:01:01.000> the<00:01:01.030> game

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:01.600 
from that city actually that the game

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.360 
from that city actually that the game
really<00:01:01.870> looks<00:01:02.140> very<00:01:02.410> similar<00:01:02.710> to<00:01:02.920> the<00:01:03.100> actual

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:03.370 
really looks very similar to the actual

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:06.809 
really looks very similar to the actual
city<00:01:03.700> of<00:01:03.850> Leo<00:01:04.059> and<00:01:04.890> we<00:01:05.890> felt<00:01:06.130> like<00:01:06.280> film<00:01:06.609> noir

00:01:06.809 --> 00:01:06.819 
city of Leo and we felt like film noir

00:01:06.819 --> 00:01:09.179 
city of Leo and we felt like film noir
which<00:01:07.149> traditionally<00:01:07.749> uses<00:01:07.960> like<00:01:08.319> shadows<00:01:08.829> as

00:01:09.179 --> 00:01:09.189 
which traditionally uses like shadows as

00:01:09.189 --> 00:01:11.340 
which traditionally uses like shadows as
a<00:01:09.219> storytelling<00:01:10.119> technique<00:01:10.569> was<00:01:10.780> one<00:01:11.200> of<00:01:11.259> the

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:11.350 
a storytelling technique was one of the

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:13.139 
a storytelling technique was one of the
best<00:01:11.499> tools<00:01:11.950> at<00:01:12.219> our<00:01:12.249> disposal<00:01:12.340> to<00:01:12.819> really

00:01:13.139 --> 00:01:13.149 
best tools at our disposal to really

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:14.969 
best tools at our disposal to really

wanted<00:03:05.000> to<00:03:05.060> do<00:03:05.269> is<00:03:05.420> you<00:03:05.780> know<00:03:05.870> light<00:03:06.140> shadows

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
wanted to do is you know light shadows

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:07.810 
wanted to do is you know light shadows
have<00:03:06.650> a<00:03:06.680> lot<00:03:06.890> of<00:03:06.920> depth<00:03:07.220> to<00:03:07.370> it<00:03:07.459> we<00:03:07.700> can

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:07.820 
have a lot of depth to it we can

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:09.340 
have a lot of depth to it we can
actually<00:03:08.000> play<00:03:08.330> through<00:03:08.540> it<00:03:08.630> we<00:03:08.780> want<00:03:09.019> to<00:03:09.200> kind

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:09.350 
actually play through it we want to kind

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:11.710 
actually play through it we want to kind
of<00:03:09.410> introduce<00:03:10.070> it<00:03:10.370> to<00:03:10.400> the<00:03:10.549> player<00:03:10.700> slowly<00:03:11.120> so

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720 
of introduce it to the player slowly so

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:12.610 
of introduce it to the player slowly so
that<00:03:11.780> the<00:03:11.959> players<00:03:12.170> come<00:03:12.410> through

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:12.620 
that the players come through

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:14.110 
that the players come through
realizations<00:03:13.340> throughout<00:03:13.700> you<00:03:13.910> know<00:03:14.000> the

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.120 
realizations throughout you know the

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:15.220 
realizations throughout you know the
different<00:03:14.390> acts<00:03:14.540> of<00:03:14.720> the<00:03:14.750> game<00:03:14.930> they<00:03:15.080> come

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.230 
different acts of the game they come

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:17.050 
different acts of the game they come
through<00:03:15.260> story<00:03:16.010> realizations<00:03:16.640> well<00:03:16.850> put

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060 
through story realizations well put

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:19.030 
through story realizations well put
their<00:03:17.180> gameplay<00:03:17.510> realizations<00:03:18.110> of<00:03:18.290> figuring

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.040 
their gameplay realizations of figuring

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.160 
their gameplay realizations of figuring
out<00:03:19.130> new<00:03:19.160> ways<00:03:19.549> in<00:03:19.790> which<00:03:19.820> to<00:03:19.940> use<00:03:20.180> lights<00:03:20.450> so

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:21.170 
out new ways in which to use lights so

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:22.810 
out new ways in which to use lights so
you<00:03:21.230> played<00:03:21.470> a<00:03:21.500> little<00:03:21.680> bit<00:03:21.860> of<00:03:21.950> Act<00:03:22.160> one<00:03:22.280> and<00:03:22.730> a

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:22.820 
you played a little bit of Act one and a

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:24.300 
you played a little bit of Act one and a
little<00:03:23.030> bit<00:03:23.120> of<00:03:23.150> Act<00:03:23.330> two

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:24.310 
little bit of Act two

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:26.490 
little bit of Act two
so<00:03:24.940> from<00:03:25.300> the<00:03:25.510> puzzle<00:03:25.780> perspective<00:03:26.230> view

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 
so from the puzzle perspective view

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.140 
so from the puzzle perspective view
being<00:03:26.890> able<00:03:27.099> to<00:03:27.190> manipulate<00:03:27.580> the<00:03:28.000> light

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
being able to manipulate the light

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:30.059 
being able to manipulate the light
sources<00:03:28.569> moving<00:03:29.050> them<00:03:29.170> around<00:03:29.290> bringing

00:03:30.059 --> 00:03:30.069 
sources moving them around bringing

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:31.710 
sources moving them around bringing
objects<00:03:30.459> closer<00:03:30.790> to<00:03:31.000> the<00:03:31.060> light<00:03:31.180> also<00:03:31.390> grow

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:31.720 
objects closer to the light also grow

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:34.559 
objects closer to the light also grow
the<00:03:31.870> shadow<00:03:32.080> casting<00:03:33.060> really<00:03:34.060> a<00:03:34.090> lot<00:03:34.390> of

00:03:34.559 --> 00:03:34.569 
the shadow casting really a lot of

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:35.850 
the shadow casting really a lot of
different<00:03:34.840> combinations<00:03:34.989> in<00:03:35.470> which<00:03:35.620> you<00:03:35.739> can

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:35.860 
different combinations in which you can

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:38.610 
different combinations in which you can
actually<00:03:36.160> affect<00:03:36.690> the<00:03:37.690> Shadowlands<00:03:38.380> game

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:38.620 
actually affect the Shadowlands game

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:39.930 
actually affect the Shadowlands game
that<00:03:38.830> you<00:03:38.920> can<00:03:39.069> then<00:03:39.190> traverse<00:03:39.489> beautiful

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:39.940 
that you can then traverse beautiful

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:41.729 
that you can then traverse beautiful
suit<00:03:40.090> of<00:03:40.180> you<00:03:40.300> you're<00:03:40.660> affecting<00:03:41.349> the<00:03:41.440> 2d

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:41.739 
suit of you you're affecting the 2d

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:43.979 
suit of you you're affecting the 2d
space<00:03:41.950> by<00:03:42.190> moving<00:03:42.640> the<00:03:42.730> 3d<00:03:43.060> space<00:03:43.330> we<00:03:43.599> perience

00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:43.989 
space by moving the 3d space we perience

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:45.750 
space by moving the 3d space we perience
it<00:03:44.080> that's<00:03:44.560> exactly<00:03:44.709> that<00:03:45.280> was<00:03:45.370> one<00:03:45.519> of<00:03:45.640> our

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:45.760 
it that's exactly that was one of our

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:47.670 
it that's exactly that was one of our
pillars<00:03:46.120> we<00:03:46.269> really<00:03:46.510> wanted<00:03:46.720> to<00:03:46.840> blend<00:03:47.080> the<00:03:47.319> 3d

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.680 
pillars we really wanted to blend the 3d

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:49.320 
pillars we really wanted to blend the 3d
space<00:03:47.920> with<00:03:48.099> the<00:03:48.190> 2d<00:03:48.459> spaces<00:03:48.849> together<00:03:48.970> so

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:49.330 
space with the 2d spaces together so

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:50.759 
space with the 2d spaces together so
that<00:03:49.360> the<00:03:49.569> experience<00:03:50.110> of<00:03:50.230> playing<00:03:50.500> would

00:03:50.759 --> 00:03:50.769 
that the experience of playing would

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:52.620 
that the experience of playing would
really<00:03:51.010> forced<00:03:51.790> you<00:03:51.880> to<00:03:52.000> think<00:03:52.209> both<00:03:52.420> in<00:03:52.540> terms

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:52.630 
really forced you to think both in terms

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:54.449 
really forced you to think both in terms
of<00:03:52.810> puzzle<00:03:53.230> and<00:03:53.380> n<00:03:53.590> in<00:03:53.709> terms<00:03:53.739> of<00:03:53.980> platforming

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:54.459 
of puzzle and n in terms of platforming

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:55.500 
of puzzle and n in terms of platforming
to<00:03:54.580> think<00:03:54.760> about<00:03:54.910> the<00:03:55.000> two<00:03:55.180> spaces

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:55.510 
to think about the two spaces

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:58.110 
to think about the two spaces
concurrently<00:03:56.230> it's<00:03:56.440> like<00:03:56.560> 44<00:03:57.549> side<00:03:57.760> of<00:03:57.880> chess

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:58.120 
concurrently it's like 44 side of chess

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:59.970 
concurrently it's like 44 side of chess
it<00:03:58.480> was<00:03:58.750> like<00:03:58.900> yeah<00:03:59.380> it<00:03:59.440> was<00:03:59.560> everything<00:03:59.769> like

00:03:59.970 --> 00:03:59.980 
it was like yeah it was everything like

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:02.240 
it was like yeah it was everything like
that<00:04:00.010> yeah<00:04:00.400> so<00:04:01.269> what<00:04:01.420> is<00:04:01.510> what<00:04:01.750> is<00:04:01.780> the<00:04:01.900> story

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250 
that yeah so what is what is the story

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:05.039 
that yeah so what is what is the story
so<00:04:03.250> we<00:04:04.000> didn't<00:04:04.269> want<00:04:04.390> to<00:04:04.480> tell<00:04:04.660> that<00:04:04.870> the

00:04:05.039 --> 00:04:05.049

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:51.620 
know there's been a trend in game to

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:53.710 
know there's been a trend in game to
really<00:04:51.860> start<00:04:52.070> tackling<00:04:52.430> more<00:04:53.030> interesting

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:53.720 
really start tackling more interesting

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:56.860 
really start tackling more interesting
less<00:04:54.320> fantastical<00:04:55.100> perhaps<00:04:55.540> that<00:04:56.540> might<00:04:56.690> have

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:56.870 
less fantastical perhaps that might have

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:58.420 
less fantastical perhaps that might have
a<00:04:56.900> little<00:04:57.080> bit<00:04:57.229> more<00:04:57.410> emotional<00:04:57.620> depth<00:04:58.010> you

00:04:58.420 --> 00:04:58.430 
a little bit more emotional depth you

00:04:58.430 --> 00:04:59.680 
a little bit more emotional depth you
this<00:04:58.580> because<00:04:58.729> games<00:04:59.030> are<00:04:59.210> sort<00:04:59.389> of<00:04:59.419> becoming

00:04:59.680 --> 00:04:59.690 
this because games are sort of becoming

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:01.510 
this because games are sort of becoming
more<00:04:59.930> of<00:04:59.990> an<00:05:00.080> all-inclusive<00:05:00.500> thing<00:05:00.950> and<00:05:01.220> we

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:01.520 
more of an all-inclusive thing and we

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:03.060 
more of an all-inclusive thing and we
more<00:05:01.760> have<00:05:01.880> these<00:05:02.030> smaller<00:05:02.360> stories<00:05:02.720> all

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:03.070

more have these smaller stories all
amongst<00:05:04.070> ourselves<00:05:04.190> so<00:05:04.910> people<00:05:05.240> should<00:05:05.300> have

00:05:05.409 --> 00:05:05.419 
amongst ourselves so people should have

00:05:05.419 --> 00:05:07.150 
amongst ourselves so people should have
attached<00:05:05.720> to<00:05:05.870> that<00:05:05.960> sort<00:05:06.169> of<00:05:06.200> thing<00:05:06.260> and<00:05:06.560> gran

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:07.160 
attached to that sort of thing and gran

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:08.710 
attached to that sort of thing and gran
wizards<00:05:07.550> and<00:05:07.700> Dragons<00:05:08.120> that's<00:05:08.270> all<00:05:08.389> fun<00:05:08.600> and

community<00:05:13.580> are<00:05:14.389> more<00:05:14.840> akin<00:05:15.620> to<00:05:15.680> these<00:05:16.190> smaller

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:16.640 
community are more akin to these smaller

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:18.670
