a Seahawks fan you know there's their

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:30.529 
a Seahawks fan you know there's their
short<00:00:29.130> answer<00:00:29.400> yes<00:00:29.429> but<00:00:30.029> it's<00:00:30.210> a<00:00:30.300> little<00:00:30.449> bit

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
short answer yes but it's a little bit

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:31.700 
short answer yes but it's a little bit
more<00:00:30.630> complex<00:00:30.990> than<00:00:31.080> that<00:00:31.140> you<00:00:31.320> don't<00:00:31.529> feel

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
more complex than that you don't feel

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.709 
more complex than that you don't feel
when<00:00:31.920> a<00:00:31.949> game<00:00:32.160> is<00:00:32.189> that<00:00:32.520> horribly<00:00:33.149> refereed

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
when a game is that horribly refereed

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.450 
when a game is that horribly refereed
right<00:00:34.079> it's<00:00:34.290> impossible<00:00:34.559> to<00:00:34.829> really<00:00:35.130> feel

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
right it's impossible to really feel

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.030 
right it's impossible to really feel
good<00:00:35.489> about<00:00:35.730> but<00:00:36.360> better<00:00:37.140> than<00:00:37.290> getting<00:00:37.920> on

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
good about but better than getting on

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.530 
good about but better than getting on
the<00:00:38.190> wrong<00:00:38.340> side<00:00:38.700> of<00:00:38.850> it<00:00:38.969> I<00:00:39.090> like<00:00:39.300> that<00:00:39.329> he
