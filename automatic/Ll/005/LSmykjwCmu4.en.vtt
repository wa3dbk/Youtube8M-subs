see<00:01:15.750> I<00:01:15.780> started<00:01:16.530> with<00:01:16.740> an<00:01:16.860> IR<00:01:17.159> didn't<00:01:17.369> bother

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
see I started with an IR didn't bother

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.420 
see I started with an IR didn't bother
with<00:01:17.790> it<00:01:17.909> I<00:01:18.090> did<00:01:18.840> choose<00:01:19.110> to<00:01:19.140> heart<00:01:19.799> templates

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430

and<00:01:20.670> a<00:01:20.850> star<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:21.659> star<00:01:21.720> is<00:01:22.909> 424<00:01:23.909> so<00:01:24.210> I<00:01:24.270> thought

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
and a star the star is 424 so I thought

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.289 
and a star the star is 424 so I thought
that<00:01:24.630> would<00:01:24.750> look<00:01:24.840> nice<00:01:25.020> to<00:01:25.290> have<00:01:25.939> 24<00:01:26.939> sit<00:01:27.180> in

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
that would look nice to have 24 sit in

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.660 
that would look nice to have 24 sit in
the<00:01:27.390> background<00:01:27.810> in<00:01:27.900> the<00:01:27.990> store<00:01:28.460> just<00:01:29.460> imagine

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
the background in the store just imagine

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.819 
the background in the store just imagine
a<00:01:29.909> men's<00:01:30.210> look<00:01:30.450> and<00:01:31.110> I'll<00:01:31.200> show<00:01:31.229> you<00:01:31.409> my<00:01:31.650> real

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
a men's look and I'll show you my real

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:36.260 
a men's look and I'll show you my real
thing<00:01:32.100> in<00:01:32.189> a<00:01:32.250> minute<00:01:32.509> no<00:01:33.509> I<00:01:35.030> measured<00:01:36.030> up<00:01:36.150> my

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
thing in a minute no I measured up my

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.850 
thing in a minute no I measured up my
envelope<00:01:36.450> and<00:01:37.640> I<00:01:38.640> figured<00:01:39.360> the<00:01:40.350> numbers<00:01:40.770> would

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
envelope and I figured the numbers would

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.830 
envelope and I figured the numbers would
need<00:01:41.040> to<00:01:41.189> be<00:01:41.340> about<00:01:41.939> 3<00:01:43.399> 32<00:01:44.399> centimeters<00:01:44.840> 55

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
need to be about 3 32 centimeters 55

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.940 
need to be about 3 32 centimeters 55
centimeters<00:01:46.310> approximately<00:01:47.310> so<00:01:47.939> I<00:01:47.970> could<00:01:48.210> fit

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:48.950 
centimeters approximately so I could fit

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:53.240 
centimeters approximately so I could fit
to<00:01:49.950> them<00:01:50.220> on<00:01:50.549> together<00:01:51.200> on<00:01:52.200> a<00:01:52.259> speech<00:01:52.740> the<00:01:52.979> top

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
to them on together on a speech the top

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.760 
to them on together on a speech the top
because<00:01:53.540> the<00:01:54.540> clothes<00:01:54.750> peg<00:01:55.049> has<00:01:55.290> to<00:01:55.530> go<00:01:55.619> on<00:01:55.710> the

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
because the clothes peg has to go on the

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.289 
because the clothes peg has to go on the
top<00:01:57.380> all<00:01:58.380> right<00:01:58.500> use<00:01:59.189> some<00:01:59.430> pretty<00:01:59.670> paper<00:01:59.909> as<00:02:00.270> a

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:11.140 
side of my stay away I think trick is to
have<00:03:09.540> a<00:03:09.600> lot<00:03:09.810> of<00:03:09.840> drawing<00:03:10.110> pin<00:03:10.380> for<00:03:10.590> that

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150 
have a lot of drawing pin for that

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:14.840 
have a lot of drawing pin for that
nothing<00:03:12.150> falls<00:03:12.360> over<00:03:13.370> went<00:03:14.370> up<00:03:14.520> the<00:03:14.670> way<00:03:14.790> from

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 
nothing falls over went up the way from

nothing falls over went up the way from
one<00:03:15.680> all<00:03:16.680> the<00:03:16.740> way<00:03:16.920> to<00:03:17.070> 24<00:03:19.940> so<00:03:20.940> if<00:03:21.060> you<00:03:21.240> got

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
one all the way to 24 so if you got

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:24.350 
one all the way to 24 so if you got
different<00:03:21.570> designs<00:03:22.080> on<00:03:22.320> there<00:03:23.210> well<00:03:24.210> how<00:03:24.300> did

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:24.360 
different designs on there well how did

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:26.240 
different designs on there well how did
you<00:03:24.600> with<00:03:24.750> that<00:03:24.900> you<00:03:25.440> can<00:03:25.620> do<00:03:25.800> whatever<00:03:25.950> you
