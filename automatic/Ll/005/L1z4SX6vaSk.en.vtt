00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.730 
pretty damn decent because of course the
wildlife<00:01:24.119> in<00:01:24.240> GTA<00:01:24.570> 5<00:01:24.780> at<00:01:24.990> the<00:01:25.049> moment<00:01:25.290> is<00:01:25.350> okay

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
wildlife in GTA 5 at the moment is okay

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:26.840 
wildlife in GTA 5 at the moment is okay
but<00:01:25.920> I<00:01:25.950> don't<00:01:26.100> think<00:01:26.159> is<00:01:26.310> very<00:01:26.490> much<00:01:26.640> online

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
but I don't think is very much online

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.910 
but I don't think is very much online
which<00:01:27.299> is<00:01:27.509> a<00:01:27.689> shame<00:01:27.990> I'd<00:01:28.320> like<00:01:28.500> to<00:01:28.650> see<00:01:28.829> it

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
which is a shame I'd like to see it

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.789 
which is a shame I'd like to see it
online<00:01:29.070> because<00:01:29.700> it<00:01:30.180> always<00:01:30.390> feels<00:01:30.840> like<00:01:31.049> when

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
online because it always feels like when

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.679 
online because it always feels like when
you<00:01:31.890> go<00:01:32.040> from<00:01:32.220> single<00:01:32.490> player<00:01:32.790> to<00:01:32.939> online<00:01:33.329> and

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
you go from single player to online and

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.749 
you go from single player to online and
you've<00:01:33.840> got<00:01:33.960> those<00:01:34.079> 16<00:01:34.500> players<00:01:34.890> it's<00:01:35.280> kind<00:01:35.549> of

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
you've got those 16 players it's kind of

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.990 
you've got those 16 players it's kind of
it<00:01:36.720> just<00:01:36.900> feels<00:01:37.200> not<00:01:38.009> as<00:01:38.130> alive<00:01:38.490> you<00:01:38.850> know<00:01:38.970> I

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
it just feels not as alive you know I

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.240 
it just feels not as alive you know I
mean<00:01:39.210> it<00:01:39.329> doesn't<00:01:39.509> feel<00:01:39.810> as<00:01:40.140> engaging<00:01:40.829> like

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
mean it doesn't feel as engaging like

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.800 
mean it doesn't feel as engaging like
you<00:01:41.520> know<00:01:41.610> in<00:01:41.729> gta4<00:01:42.150> you'd<00:01:42.420> have<00:01:42.540> the<00:01:42.630> same

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
you know in gta4 you'd have the same

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.200 
you know in gta4 you'd have the same
thing<00:01:43.110> where<00:01:43.350> the<00:01:43.500> the<00:01:43.890> online<00:01:44.040> AI<00:01:44.520> was<00:01:44.880> just<00:01:44.909> a

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
thing where the the online AI was just a

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.499 
thing where the the online AI was just a
bit<00:01:45.360> dim<00:01:46.020> and<00:01:46.380> and<00:01:46.770> just<00:01:46.979> not<00:01:47.220> there<00:01:47.640> compared

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
bit dim and and just not there compared

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:49.760 
bit dim and and just not there compared
to<00:01:48.659> what<00:01:48.780> you'd<00:01:48.899> have<00:01:49.049> in<00:01:49.290> the<00:01:49.380> single-player

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
to what you'd have in the single-player

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.530 
to what you'd have in the single-player
there<00:01:50.070> was<00:01:50.159> a<00:01:50.189> lot<00:01:50.399> more<00:01:50.430> variety<00:01:51.180> in<00:01:51.210> the<00:01:51.390> AI

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
there was a lot more variety in the AI

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.030 
there was a lot more variety in the AI
and<00:01:51.840> the<00:01:51.930> characters<00:01:52.409> that<00:01:52.560> were<00:01:52.680> walking

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
and the characters that were walking

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.560 
and the characters that were walking
around<00:01:53.130> compared<00:01:54.030> to<00:01:54.090> what<00:01:54.210> you<00:01:54.299> saw<00:01:54.420> in

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
around compared to what you saw in

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.060 
around compared to what you saw in
online<00:01:54.689> so<00:01:55.049> that's<00:01:55.170> gonna<00:01:55.409> be<00:01:55.500> pretty<00:01:55.829> good<00:01:55.950> as

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
online so that's gonna be pretty good as

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.520 
online so that's gonna be pretty good as
well<00:01:56.280> then<00:01:56.909> to<00:01:57.090> traffic<00:01:57.570> that's<00:01:57.780> number<00:01:58.049> seven

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
well then to traffic that's number seven

00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:59.870 
well then to traffic that's number seven
what<00:01:58.649> you're<00:01:58.740> gonna<00:01:58.829> be<00:01:58.979> seeing<00:01:59.189> is<00:01:59.399> highways

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
what you're gonna be seeing is highways

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.120 
what you're gonna be seeing is highways
that<00:02:00.149> are<00:02:00.360> busier<00:02:00.990> than<00:02:01.200> they<00:02:01.380> already<00:02:01.530> are<00:02:01.710> I

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
that are busier than they already are I

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.190 
that are busier than they already are I
always<00:02:02.640> thought<00:02:02.820> that<00:02:02.880> the<00:02:03.420> traffic<00:02:03.689> system

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
always thought that the traffic system

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.200 
always thought that the traffic system
in<00:02:04.290> GTA<00:02:04.560> 5<00:02:04.860> already<00:02:05.159> is<00:02:05.430> pretty<00:02:05.610> damn<00:02:05.939> decent

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
in GTA 5 already is pretty damn decent

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.330 
in GTA 5 already is pretty damn decent
and<00:02:06.689> some<00:02:07.140> of<00:02:07.290> their<00:02:07.500> the<00:02:07.530> drivers<00:02:08.160> are<00:02:08.310> a

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
and some of their the drivers are a

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:09.859 
and some of their the drivers are a
little<00:02:08.489> bit<00:02:08.700> erratic<00:02:08.970> and<00:02:09.300> crazy<00:02:09.569> but

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
little bit erratic and crazy but

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.089 
little bit erratic and crazy but
occasionally<00:02:10.289> if<00:02:10.410> you've<00:02:10.530> got<00:02:10.739> a<00:02:10.770> motorcycle

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
occasionally if you've got a motorcycle

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.790 
occasionally if you've got a motorcycle
pulling<00:02:11.700> up<00:02:11.849> beside<00:02:12.150> you<00:02:12.360> taking<00:02:13.200> off<00:02:13.349> it

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
pulling up beside you taking off it

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.320 
pulling up beside you taking off it
take<00:02:13.860> off<00:02:14.040> at<00:02:14.250> some<00:02:14.490> speed<00:02:14.850> you<00:02:15.030> know<00:02:15.120> I<00:02:15.150> mean

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
take off at some speed you know I mean

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.030 
take off at some speed you know I mean
other<00:02:15.540> than<00:02:15.630> just<00:02:15.930> it's<00:02:16.380> just<00:02:16.710> kind<00:02:16.920> of

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
other than just it's just kind of

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.800 
other than just it's just kind of
cruising<00:02:17.550> around<00:02:17.670> and<00:02:18.030> you<00:02:18.120> can<00:02:18.270> see<00:02:18.570> and<00:02:18.750> you

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
cruising around and you can see and you

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.410 
cruising around and you can see and you
can<00:02:18.990> feel<00:02:19.260> that<00:02:19.340> it's<00:02:20.340> on<00:02:20.580> a<00:02:20.610> treadmill<00:02:20.940> like

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:22.970 
can feel that it's on a treadmill like
it's<00:02:21.630> just<00:02:21.900> kind<00:02:22.140> of<00:02:22.260> doing<00:02:22.620> what<00:02:22.650> it's

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
it's just kind of doing what it's

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.950 
it's just kind of doing what it's
programmed<00:02:23.220> to<00:02:23.580> do<00:02:23.820> where<00:02:24.060> is<00:02:24.240> if<00:02:24.540> you've<00:02:24.750> got

because<00:02:51.980> if<00:02:52.980> you<00:02:53.130> think<00:02:53.310> at<00:02:53.460> the<00:02:53.580> moment

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
because if you think at the moment

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:55.460 
because if you think at the moment
you've<00:02:54.030> got<00:02:54.060> bushes<00:02:54.660> that<00:02:54.840> you<00:02:54.930> just<00:02:55.140> career

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
you've got bushes that you just career

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.290 
you've got bushes that you just career
straight<00:02:55.800> into<00:02:56.190> and<00:02:56.430> I<00:02:56.700> imagine<00:02:57.210> that's

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:57.300 
straight into and I imagine that's

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:58.820 
straight into and I imagine that's
because<00:02:57.690> they<00:02:57.840> couldn't<00:02:58.080> really<00:02:58.230> do<00:02:58.620> very

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
because they couldn't really do very

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:00.380 
because they couldn't really do very
much<00:02:58.950> about<00:02:59.250> it<00:02:59.430> I<00:02:59.670> imagine<00:02:59.940> there<00:03:00.240> will<00:03:00.330> be

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
much about it I imagine there will be

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.330 
much about it I imagine there will be
changes<00:03:00.810> to<00:03:00.870> that<00:03:01.200> not<00:03:01.740> only<00:03:01.860> that<00:03:02.010> but

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
changes to that not only that but

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.130 
changes to that not only that but
there'll<00:03:02.550> be<00:03:02.580> visual<00:03:03.120> system<00:03:03.570> changes<00:03:04.020> as

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
there'll be visual system changes as

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.170 
there'll be visual system changes as
well<00:03:04.380> so<00:03:04.620> that<00:03:04.800> within<00:03:05.250> there<00:03:05.550> with<00:03:05.970> a<00:03:06.000> new

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
well so that within there with a new

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.390 
well so that within there with a new
hardware<00:03:06.630> and<00:03:06.690> stuff<00:03:07.050> you've<00:03:07.230> got<00:03:07.400> animations

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
hardware and stuff you've got animations

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:09.830 
hardware and stuff you've got animations
that<00:03:08.610> happen<00:03:08.910> that<00:03:09.030> you<00:03:09.090> just<00:03:09.270> couldn't<00:03:09.540> get

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
that happen that you just couldn't get

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.750 
that happen that you just couldn't get
in<00:03:09.990> GTA<00:03:10.380> 5<00:03:10.650> already<00:03:11.010> I<00:03:11.130> mean<00:03:11.220> there<00:03:11.460> were<00:03:11.550> a<00:03:11.640> lot

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
in GTA 5 already I mean there were a lot

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.160 
in GTA 5 already I mean there were a lot
of<00:03:11.880> things<00:03:12.060> that<00:03:12.180> they<00:03:12.330> fixed<00:03:12.690> and<00:03:12.810> changed

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
of things that they fixed and changed

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.140 
of things that they fixed and changed
and<00:03:13.290> improved<00:03:13.430> but<00:03:14.430> there<00:03:14.610> was<00:03:14.730> probably<00:03:15.060> a

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
and improved but there was probably a

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:16.760 
and improved but there was probably a
way<00:03:15.300> that<00:03:15.480> they<00:03:15.570> could<00:03:15.750> go<00:03:15.900> so<00:03:16.170> trees<00:03:16.470> you<00:03:16.620> get

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:16.770 
way that they could go so trees you get

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:18.680 
way that they could go so trees you get
a<00:03:16.800> look<00:03:16.950> nicer<00:03:17.490> things<00:03:18.090> are<00:03:18.239> gonna<00:03:18.360> be<00:03:18.540> going

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
a look nicer things are gonna be going

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:20.270 
a look nicer things are gonna be going
all<00:03:18.900> over<00:03:19.170> the<00:03:19.260> place<00:03:19.470> which<00:03:19.650> is<00:03:19.680> great<00:03:19.830> and

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:21.710 
all over the place which is great and
it's<00:03:20.489> gonna<00:03:20.640> it's<00:03:20.970> gonna<00:03:21.090> look<00:03:21.330> good<00:03:21.510> it's

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
it's gonna it's gonna look good it's

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.000 
it's gonna it's gonna look good it's
just<00:03:21.900> gonna<00:03:21.989> be<00:03:22.200> a<00:03:22.230> lot<00:03:22.500> better<00:03:22.709> than<00:03:22.950> what

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
just gonna be a lot better than what

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:24.979 
just gonna be a lot better than what

lightning in that it's just

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.210 
lightning in that it's just
mind-boggling<00:03:43.170> right<00:03:43.560> that's<00:03:43.770> something

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
mind-boggling right that's something

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:45.530

single-player before they've got you

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:48.710 
single-player before they've got you
know<00:03:46.980> way<00:03:47.160> ages<00:03:47.850> ago<00:03:47.940> when<00:03:48.150> the<00:03:48.239> game<00:03:48.390> was<00:03:48.570> just

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
know way ages ago when the game was just

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.630 
know way ages ago when the game was just
coming<00:03:49.080> out<00:03:49.200> they've<00:03:49.440> been<00:03:49.470> enhancing<00:03:50.340> stuff

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:50.640 
coming out they've been enhancing stuff

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:52.640 
coming out they've been enhancing stuff
already<00:03:50.970> but<00:03:51.300> stuff<00:03:51.930> like<00:03:52.140> that<00:03:52.290> it's<00:03:52.470> just

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
already but stuff like that it's just

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:54.500 
already but stuff like that it's just
gonna<00:03:52.770> be<00:03:52.950> all<00:03:53.160> over<00:03:53.489> the<00:03:53.580> place<00:03:53.790> but<00:03:54.000> I<00:03:54.090> reckon

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:54.510

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:01.709 
might even get snow at the early again

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:03.260 
might even get snow at the early again
at<00:04:01.950> Christmas<00:04:02.280> which<00:04:02.610> would<00:04:02.730> be<00:04:02.850> pretty<00:04:03.090> good

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:03.270 
at Christmas which would be pretty good

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:05.150 
at Christmas which would be pretty good
just<00:04:03.750> the<00:04:03.870> way<00:04:04.020> things<00:04:04.080> go<00:04:04.410> would<00:04:04.680> be<00:04:04.770> nice<00:04:04.950> and

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:05.160 
just the way things go would be nice and

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:06.650 
just the way things go would be nice and
damage<00:04:05.489> effects<00:04:05.820> as<00:04:06.000> well<00:04:06.150> of<00:04:06.300> course<00:04:06.330> because

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:06.660 
damage effects as well of course because

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:08.000 
damage effects as well of course because
at<00:04:06.780> the<00:04:06.870> moment<00:04:06.900> there<00:04:07.230> are<00:04:07.380> some<00:04:07.620> things<00:04:07.860> that

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.010 
at the moment there are some things that

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:09.800 
at the moment there are some things that
are<00:04:08.100> a<00:04:08.130> little<00:04:08.220> bit<00:04:08.370> skew<00:04:08.760> if<00:04:08.910> with<00:04:09.480> the<00:04:09.600> cars

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.810 
are a little bit skew if with the cars

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:11.750 
are a little bit skew if with the cars
if<00:04:10.080> you<00:04:10.170> run<00:04:10.350> into<00:04:10.620> a<00:04:10.650> wall<00:04:10.739> similar<00:04:11.310> so<00:04:11.640> you're

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:11.760 
if you run into a wall similar so you're
