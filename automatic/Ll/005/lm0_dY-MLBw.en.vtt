cut it and I recommend just using old
scissors<00:00:57.379> and<00:00:57.620> just<00:00:58.190> go<00:00:58.370> right<00:00:58.640> along<00:00:59.000> the

00:00:59.439 --> 00:00:59.449 
scissors and just go right along the

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:08.410 
scissors and just go right along the
line<00:00:59.690> of<00:00:59.719> the<00:01:00.850> screen<00:01:05.679> figure<00:01:06.679> out<00:01:06.829> how<00:01:07.420> wide

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:08.420 
line of the screen figure out how wide

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:13.870 
line of the screen figure out how wide

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:15.409 
a little bit more so it'll go over your

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:23.840 
wrist now I just put a couple staples

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:30.789 
wrist now I just put a couple staples
here<00:01:24.340> to<00:01:25.340> hold<00:01:25.520> it<00:01:25.639> together<00:01:28.539> and<00:01:29.799> here's

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:30.799

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:35.080 
here to hold it together and here's
where<00:01:31.069> the<00:01:31.219> fun<00:01:31.459> begins<00:01:33.459> just<00:01:34.459> start<00:01:34.849> taking

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.090 
where the fun begins just start taking

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:37.809 
where the fun begins just start taking
the<00:01:36.079> aleene's<00:01:36.469> tacky<00:01:36.590> glue<00:01:37.069> and<00:01:37.429> put<00:01:37.639> it<00:01:37.729> on

00:01:37.809 --> 00:01:37.819 
the aleene's tacky glue and put it on

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:39.639 
the aleene's tacky glue and put it on
the<00:01:37.939> edges<00:01:38.299> now<00:01:38.479> what<00:01:38.689> it's<00:01:38.840> doing<00:01:39.289> is<00:01:39.439> its

00:01:39.639 --> 00:01:39.649 
the edges now what it's doing is its

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:42.190 
the edges now what it's doing is its
sealing<00:01:40.189> the<00:01:40.340> edges<00:01:40.490> if<00:01:40.939> it<00:01:41.389> has<00:01:41.569> any<00:01:41.869> little

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.200

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:48.609 
sealing the edges if it has any little
spots<00:01:42.590> that<00:01:42.829> are<00:01:42.979> sticking<00:01:43.969> up<00:01:47.200> you<00:01:48.200> also<00:01:48.349> want

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:48.619 
spots that are sticking up you also want

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:51.330 
spots that are sticking up you also want
to<00:01:48.649> make<00:01:48.770> sure<00:01:48.919> you're<00:01:49.069> going<00:01:49.189> to<00:01:49.249> go<00:01:49.340> over<00:01:49.749> the

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:51.340 
to make sure you're going to go over the

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.729 
to make sure you're going to go over the
staples<00:01:52.340> that<00:01:52.459> you<00:01:52.549> put<00:01:52.759> in<00:01:52.959> and<00:01:53.959> I<00:01:54.109> found<00:01:54.529> that

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:54.739 
staples that you put in and I found that

00:01:54.739 --> 00:01:56.499 
staples that you put in and I found that
I<00:01:54.799> have<00:01:55.039> to<00:01:55.159> kind<00:01:55.340> of<00:01:55.459> do<00:01:55.639> one<00:01:56.029> side<00:01:56.270> at<00:01:56.419> a<00:01:56.450> time

00:01:56.499 --> 00:01:56.509 
I have to kind of do one side at a time

00:01:56.509 --> 00:01:58.059 
I have to kind of do one side at a time
so<00:01:57.049> I'm<00:01:57.109> going<00:01:57.229> to<00:01:57.289> let<00:01:57.409> I<00:01:57.649> would<00:01:57.770> let<00:01:57.919> like

00:01:58.059 --> 00:01:58.069 
so I'm going to let I would let like

00:01:58.069 --> 00:02:00.370 
so I'm going to let I would let like
that<00:01:58.249> slide<00:01:58.520> dry<00:01:58.789> go<00:01:59.479> to<00:01:59.630> the<00:01:59.749> other<00:01:59.869> side<00:02:00.139> and

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:00.380 
that slide dry go to the other side and

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:02.940 
that slide dry go to the other side and
then<00:02:00.529> you<00:02:00.559> can<00:02:00.770> put<00:02:00.919> any<00:02:01.099> amount<00:02:01.429> of<00:02:01.520> glue<00:02:01.669> on

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 
then you can put any amount of glue on

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:07.029 
then you can put any amount of glue on
the<00:02:03.950> main<00:02:04.189> area<00:02:04.639> there<00:02:05.619> so<00:02:06.619> you<00:02:06.679> would<00:02:06.859> set

00:02:07.029 --> 00:02:07.039 
the main area there so you would set

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.839 
the main area there so you would set
that<00:02:07.219> aside<00:02:07.340> to<00:02:07.639> dry

00:02:07.839 --> 00:02:07.849 
that aside to dry

00:02:07.849 --> 00:02:09.459 
that aside to dry
and<00:02:08.090> it<00:02:08.149> would<00:02:08.270> it<00:02:08.719> would<00:02:08.810> be<00:02:08.929> ready<00:02:09.140> when<00:02:09.439> the

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:09.469 
and it would it would be ready when the

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:12.540 
and it would it would be ready when the
glue<00:02:09.829> is<00:02:09.860> completely<00:02:10.519> clear

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
glue is completely clear

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:15.930 
glue is completely clear
this<00:02:13.510> one<00:02:13.780> I<00:02:13.990> made<00:02:14.980> last<00:02:15.190> night<00:02:15.340> so<00:02:15.640> it's<00:02:15.760> all

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
this one I made last night so it's all

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.120 
this one I made last night so it's all
clear<00:02:16.270> and<00:02:16.480> the<00:02:17.050> next<00:02:17.290> step<00:02:17.470> is<00:02:17.650> is<00:02:17.950> you're

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.130 
clear and the next step is is you're

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:20.250 
clear and the next step is is you're
just<00:02:18.250> going<00:02:18.520> to<00:02:18.580> paint<00:02:18.940> and<00:02:19.510> I<00:02:19.600> like<00:02:19.870> to<00:02:20.020> use<00:02:20.230> a

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
just going to paint and I like to use a

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.070 
just going to paint and I like to use a
sponge<00:02:20.740> and<00:02:21.160> the<00:02:21.760> best<00:02:22.060> colors<00:02:22.420> to<00:02:22.600> go<00:02:22.720> on<00:02:22.900> to

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
sponge and the best colors to go on to

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.890 
sponge and the best colors to go on to
this<00:02:23.200> I<00:02:23.440> think<00:02:23.470> are<00:02:24.070> the<00:02:24.280> metallic<00:02:24.790> colors<00:02:24.970> it

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
this I think are the metallic colors it

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:33.600 
this I think are the metallic colors it
just<00:02:26.140> makes<00:02:26.410> it<00:02:26.530> look<00:02:26.680> so<00:02:26.740> rich<00:02:32.190> so<00:02:33.190> you<00:02:33.280> go<00:02:33.400> on

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610
