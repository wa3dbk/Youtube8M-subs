 Setup Wizard 

00:00:17.019 --> 00:00:20.019
 and we go to the email configuration option 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:25.220
 gives us two options you want have created add an address that is 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:29.879
 our that we already have loot made an email account of that 

00:00:29.879 --> 00:00:33.300
 corporate level of mild blackberry in this case 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.360
 let's choose the first 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.360
 we use the following 

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:42.310
 is set 

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:45.770
 is connecting better for the configuration of the email 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:49.850
 the terms of use of the service appear 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.800
 Once read the terms are accepted 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.480
 and follows the tail activation process 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:05.150

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.380
 the best known among others has yahoo 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:13.370
 aol windows live 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:17.060
 and others in email addresses as well as we can create 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.690
 an exclusive electronic address with the blackberry domain dot after 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:23.530
 point is that address will be only accessible from the 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:25.720
 blackberry 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:29.190
 in principle we are going to use an account and in which we already have created so that 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:31.710
 see and the steps to follow 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.710
 we just have to click on the Yemen section 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:38.430
 Introduce 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.430
 the direction 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:46.120
 the address that we have 

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:49.120
 we'll see 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:52.630
 Our choice of time inc strap 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:55.630
 and the password 

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:06.720
 we will see next 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:08.659
 the discharge is processed 

00:02:08.659 --> 00:02:12.189
 and we see how the email account has been successfully added 

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:16.469
 from there I made myself 

00:02:16.469 --> 00:02:20.810
 and asks if we want to synchronize the contacts with the device this 

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:24.139
 leaves a marked because very interesting notion at the time of having 

00:02:24.139 --> 00:02:26.039
 our agenda 

00:02:26.039 --> 00:02:29.359
 on the two sites online and well the device 

00:02:29.359 --> 00:02:32.359
 click on next 

00:02:37.149 --> 00:02:40.299
 and we see how the activation is being applied 

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:43.919
 After a few seconds we will have created our Yemen mailbox in the 

00:02:43.919 --> 00:02:47.049
 screen of the blackberry 93 0 0 

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:50.699
 appears in a general mailbox where all the unified messages are 

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:53.709
 for the different buttons that we have configured 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:55.959
 and in this case as we only have one 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:58.959
 we found in shortcut icons to our yemen account 

00:02:59.469 --> 00:03:00.089
 once again
